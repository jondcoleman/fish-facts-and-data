00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:20.220
 "Hello and welcome to another episode of no such thing as a fish, a weekly podcast

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.680
 coming to you from the QI offices in Covenant Garden.

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:28.800
 My name is Dan Schreiber, I'm sitting here with James Harkin, Andrew Hunter Murray, and

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.280
 Aniches Insky, and once again we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:39.960
 facts from the last seven days, and in no particular order, here we go, starting with you, Andy."

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.120
 My Vectors that when Britain declared war in 1914, they accidentally did it in the wrong

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:49.320
 format and they had to swap the letters, otherwise Britain would not technically be at war.

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.120
 "Well, what kind of farm that was?

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:56.620
 I don't know, I don't know if it was in landscape or in some kind of... what they declared

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:01.400
 with a painter or in a m... or emojis or so, I don't know, I have no idea.

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:05.560
 But this is from an article in Times Literary Supplement, which is great by the way, highly

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:09.540
 recommended, and there was a British diplomat called Harold Nicholson who was working at

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:14.380
 the foreign office, and one day he was told, "We've declared war on Germany, but we screwed

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:18.900
 it up," and we sent the letter which doesn't quite say the right phrase, I think.

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:24.380
 I think what it was was, they thought that Germany had declared war because they intercepted

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:29.800
 some thing over their radio waves, but actually Germany hadn't declared war, and so the letter

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:33.900
 said, "We accept your declaration of war, but what they actually wanted to say was, we declare

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:34.900
 war on you."

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:39.700
 Ah, because Britain was obliged to go to the defence of Belgium and Germany have violated

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:45.320
 a Belgian territory, and so, yeah, so... that's a sort of, you can't fire me, I quit, situation

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:46.320
 isn't it?

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:47.320
 It's very much like that.

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:52.260
 Yeah, it's like getting a text message saying, "I'm having an affair too," and then you

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.260
 have to withdraw that.

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:55.260
 And just say.

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:56.260
 And just say, "I'm having an affair."

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.620
 It's like getting the text message saying, "I'm having an affair," and then your spouse

00:01:58.620 --> 00:01:59.620
 says, "I wasn't having an affair.

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:00.620
 What are you talking about?"

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:05.860
 Guys, I really think you should do these kind of things face to face.

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:10.300
 But Nicholson had to go to the German embassy at night, and he went so late in the day that

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:15.300
 the German ambassador, who was Prince Lichnovsky, he was in his pajamas in his bedroom, and he

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:19.960
 had the letter declaring war on a tray by his bed, and Nicholson had to do the old switch

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:21.960
 to Rue.

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:24.040
 And he says that he didn't notice, the Prince didn't notice.

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:27.960
 He thought it was just a social visit to say, "Well, sorry, we're a war now."

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:30.960
 And was this, this was after they'd officially declared war, it was just they were like, "Oh,

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:31.960
 we've got a bit of the paperwork wrong.

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:32.960
 We've got to swap that."

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:34.960
 It was that evening, yeah.

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:35.960
 It was that evening, yeah.

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:41.160
 So what had happened was Britain had given an automaton to Germany, saying, "If you don't

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:44.880
 get out of Belgium, we're going to declare war," and then it got to the evening and they

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:48.620
 thought Germany had declared war, but they hadn't, and then when it got to midnight,

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:50.620
 that was our automaton had kind of hit then.

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:51.620
 It was actually 11pm.

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:52.620
 11pm, sorry.

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:53.620
 It's very important.

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:54.620
 It is.

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:55.620
 Very important.

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:59.660
 You see, if I wasn't charged, we'd never go to war, would we?

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:02.620
 But poor old Lichnovsky was so upset, wasn't he?

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:06.140
 So he was the ambassador, and I always think ambassadors must have such a difficult job

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:09.300
 in war, because they're friends with everyone in the country they're in.

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:12.300
 So he was mates with all the Brits.

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:17.060
 He was very good friends with Asquith, and his wife, Margot Asquith, so Margot Asquith's

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:23.020
 wife, actually went to visit Lichnovsky about an hour or two before war was properly declared

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:25.460
 and just went to comfort him and say, "Sorry, this is rough, isn't it?"

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:27.700
 And he was sobbing, saying, "It's all over."

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:32.500
 And he knew Nicholson as well, so yeah, because when Nicholson went to visit him, he was

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:33.500
 in his night clothes.

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:36.500
 The last thing he said to him was, "Give my best regards to your father.

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:39.500
 I shall not, in all probability, see him before my departure."

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:40.500
 Yeah.

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:42.500
 And they hated the Germans.

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:43.500
 He's good.

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:44.500
 Who did the German ambassador?

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:49.500
 Yeah, so the ambassador's wife said to Margot Asquith on just the second of August, so two days

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:54.220
 before we went to war, to think that we should bring such sorrows to an innocent and happy

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:55.220
 people.

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:59.140
 I've always hated and loathed our Kaiser, having not said so a thousand times here in his

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:00.740
 friends were all Brits.

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:02.420
 So they were not pleased about it.

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:06.380
 No, and I suppose if you are an ambassador, you're going to have a more rounded world view,

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:07.380
 aren't you?

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:08.380
 Yeah.

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:09.380
 You know, probably, I don't know.

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:10.380
 Yeah.

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:11.380
 I've never been one.

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:16.980
 I'm sorry, just on Nicholson, then he later went on, people might have heard of him, because

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:24.180
 he later went on to marry writer Vita Sackfield West in a kind of marriage of convenience, because

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:28.700
 I think he was gay and she was a lesbian, or they were maybe both bisexual, but they kind

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:33.220
 of got married so that she could inherit her ancestral home of Sissinghurst.

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:36.540
 I'm sure it wasn't a phrasing mistake, and he didn't mean to say, "You're not going

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:37.540
 to like something like that."

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:38.540
 Yeah.

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:39.540
 He accidentally wrote, "Would you marry me?"

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:40.540
 I'm sorry.

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:41.820
 I meant to say, "I don't."

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:46.620
 I've not heard of her, is she a big author?

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:50.140
 She's a poet, and she's quite famous.

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:51.140
 Cool.

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:54.060
 I obviously know her, because she has a weird name, right?

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:55.060
 Yeah.

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:56.780
 It kind of sticks in your head, doesn't it?

00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:57.780
 Yeah.

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:00.860
 So George the Fifth also, sort of, lots of people declare war.

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:04.420
 Officially, George the Fifth is one of the people who sort of announced the nation that we

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:07.820
 were at war, and his diary is very interesting, because it's so matter of fact.

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:13.540
 So his diary on that night, he wrote it just before he went to sleep, and it was a short

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:14.540
 entry.

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:17.900
 He said, "I held a council at 10.45 in the evening to declare war with Germany.

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:21.020
 It is a terrible catastrophe, but it is not our fault."

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:24.620
 And then he said, "The crowds were all cheering."

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:27.860
 When they heard war had been declared, the cheering was even more terrific, went to Bennett

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:28.860
 Midnight.

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:31.900
 And that's just, that's the start of the first world war for you.

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:32.900
 Oh, yeah.

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:35.500
 There were loads of, because they had a speech in Parliament, didn't they?

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:38.220
 Was it grey or someone did a speech in Parliament?

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:42.780
 And everyone was outside kind of expecting that war was going to be declared.

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:47.820
 And there was a mob in London who attacked the German Embassy, and at the same time there

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:52.220
 was a mob in Germany that attacked the British Embassy in Berlin, throwing stones.

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:54.820
 That is kind of a microcosm of the next four years.

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:55.820
 Yes.

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:59.540
 There's someone else who we know where they were when war broke out, and it's Adolf Hitler.

00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:03.940
 And the interesting thing is we know, because there was a photograph taken of this huge crowd

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:08.060
 in Munich at a place called the Odian Plats, and they're all celebrating.

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:11.020
 There's lots of people, lots of crowds all over Europe celebrated the outbreak of war.

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:12.580
 They thought it was a good thing.

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:18.500
 And you can see, if you zoom in, Hitler in the crowd with a really big droopy moustache.

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:19.500
 Really?

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:20.500
 Yeah.

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:21.500
 But this is the crazy thing.

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:26.620
 So the photo was taken by a photographer who later became Hitler's official photographer,

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:31.300
 and in one of the very early bits of Nazi propaganda, Hitler, they tracked down this

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:35.380
 photo, they saw you saw Hitler in the crowd, and they retouched his moustache to turn it into

00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:38.900
 the toothbrush moustache, that Hitler later adopted.

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:43.780
 Oh, if only we all had photographers to retouch photos from our youth.

00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:47.220
 Our parents would be so thrilled to do it.

00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:52.940
 Well, apart from he kind of retouches them all to make it look like he did when he was older.

00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:53.940
 It's true.

00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:55.940
 It's like giving yourself a mullet in a photo from the 80s.

00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:56.940
 It's really weird.

00:06:56.940 --> 00:06:57.940
 Yeah.

00:06:57.940 --> 00:07:00.780
 But you're always ashamed of how you dress when you're younger, whether it's a weird

00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:03.460
 bit of moustache, or you've got your stupid long hair from the 70s.

00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:04.460
 Sorry.

00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:05.460
 It's not like giving yourself a mullet, isn't it?

00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:06.460
 No, it's the opposite.

00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:07.460
 No, it's the opposite.

00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:08.460
 It's the opposite.

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:09.460
 Yeah, it's taking away the mullet.

00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:10.460
 Yes.

00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:11.460
 The mullet's embarrassing.

00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:12.460
 It's like moustache.

00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:18.300
 It's like the Pope going back to his baby photos and putting a big hat on the mullet.

00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:20.980
 It's exactly what it's like.

00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:24.180
 Did you read one of the other amazing pieces of protocol they had to go through that

00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:30.060
 day when Britain declared war, was that the foreign office sent out loads of telegrams

00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:33.700
 to all the continents around the world that were vaguely affiliated with warning them were

00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:34.700
 about to go to war.

00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:38.700
 So this is sort of in the afternoon going on early evening, all these telegrams were sent

00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:43.500
 out, and the foreign office clerks had to send them out, and all they had to do was fill

00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:47.940
 it in a pre-written telegram that said just to warn you, Britain is going to war with

00:07:47.940 --> 00:07:48.940
 blank.

00:07:48.940 --> 00:07:52.260
 And they just wrote the word Germany, because they'd had them pre-written for about ten

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:53.260
 years.

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:54.260
 No, good.

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:56.460
 They just knew that they were going to go to war eventually.

00:07:56.460 --> 00:08:01.060
 It's like, you know, when you are a kid and you have birthday invites, and it says you

00:08:01.060 --> 00:08:05.660
 are invited to Blacks Party, like it's exactly like that, is it?

00:08:05.660 --> 00:08:06.660
 It is.

00:08:06.660 --> 00:08:09.140
 Do you think some were accidentally they forgot to fill them in and consciously just left

00:08:09.140 --> 00:08:10.140
 guessing?

00:08:10.140 --> 00:08:11.140
 Right.

00:08:11.140 --> 00:08:15.420
 I would have for a laugh put a different country in just one telegram, just so one British

00:08:15.420 --> 00:08:19.140
 territory overseas thinks we're at war with Switzerland or something.

00:08:19.140 --> 00:08:20.140
 Yes.

00:08:20.140 --> 00:08:21.900
 Or do you think they sent it to Germany and it just said you?

00:08:21.900 --> 00:08:22.900
 Oh, yeah.

00:08:22.900 --> 00:08:28.180
 Real privilege, the most senior clerk got to do the you one.

00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:33.020
 I was just reading generally about what happened as soon as war was declared, and obviously

00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:38.140
 a lot of soldiers had to be conscripted, and that led me into just looking into conscription.

00:08:38.140 --> 00:08:40.820
 And I read about this thing, which I'd not heard of, I don't know if you guys have, but

00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:41.820
 the pals of Italian.

00:08:41.820 --> 00:08:44.020
 Have you heard of that?

00:08:44.020 --> 00:08:48.460
 This was, so obviously they had to work out what was the best way to get people sort

00:08:48.460 --> 00:08:50.820
 of passionate about joining the war.

00:08:50.820 --> 00:08:56.020
 And one of the ideas was the idea that if you signed up with a friend of yours, there

00:08:56.020 --> 00:08:59.140
 was a promise that you would both be in the same battalion.

00:08:59.140 --> 00:09:02.740
 So professional golfers were known to sign up with each other.

00:09:02.740 --> 00:09:07.740
 There was the Grimsby Chums, and that was former schoolboys from wintering him secondary

00:09:07.740 --> 00:09:08.740
 school and Grimsby Grimsby.

00:09:08.740 --> 00:09:11.740
 A terrible idea, actually, because if you're going to go to war and have to see all these

00:09:11.740 --> 00:09:14.300
 people around you dropping dead, I'd rather they weren't all my mates.

00:09:14.300 --> 00:09:15.300
 I know.

00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:16.780
 I guess it's a morale thing though up until that point.

00:09:16.780 --> 00:09:20.500
 Well, the idea is that you might fight harder if it's to save your friends, I think.

00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:21.500
 Yes, yes.

00:09:21.500 --> 00:09:28.180
 There was, in Thieves, they had a secret band of an army where they were all lovers, all

00:09:28.180 --> 00:09:29.260
 gay lovers.

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:31.980
 And so they would all be in this army together and they would all fight.

00:09:31.980 --> 00:09:32.980
 Where was it?

00:09:32.980 --> 00:09:34.460
 This is in Thieves in the Spartan.

00:09:34.460 --> 00:09:35.460
 In the Spartan?

00:09:35.460 --> 00:09:36.460
 Wow, really?

00:09:36.460 --> 00:09:37.220
 There's not a lot of innovation.

00:09:37.220 --> 00:09:38.220
 No.

00:09:38.220 --> 00:09:43.460
 Although actually the war between Sparta and Athens did go on until 1996.

00:09:43.460 --> 00:09:44.460
 What?

00:09:44.460 --> 00:09:45.460
 No.

00:09:45.460 --> 00:09:46.460
 Come on now.

00:09:46.460 --> 00:09:50.060
 It was one of those ones, you know, where they don't sign their peace agreement.

00:09:50.060 --> 00:09:51.060
 Yeah.

00:09:51.060 --> 00:09:55.420
 And so in 1986, they signed a symbolic agreement that Sparta and Athens were no longer at

00:09:55.420 --> 00:10:00.900
 war, even though that they'd both been part of modern day Greece for about a thousand years.

00:10:00.900 --> 00:10:04.260
 So I think we may have briefly mentioned the Barrack upon Tweed thing before.

00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:06.380
 So there's this, the town of Barrack on Tweed.

00:10:06.380 --> 00:10:11.780
 They mistakenly believed that they were at war with Russia for about 150 years after

00:10:11.780 --> 00:10:13.780
 the end of the Crimean War.

00:10:13.780 --> 00:10:16.060
 So that ended 1856.

00:10:16.060 --> 00:10:19.940
 And it's because there was this really complicated history with Barrack upon Tweed.

00:10:19.940 --> 00:10:22.140
 Because it's right on the border of England and Scotland.

00:10:22.140 --> 00:10:24.820
 And it went, it changed hands about 13 times.

00:10:24.820 --> 00:10:28.660
 And there was a 1502 agreement between England and Scotland, which said that Barrack upon Tweed

00:10:28.660 --> 00:10:32.100
 is off, but not within the kingdom of England.

00:10:32.100 --> 00:10:35.100
 Actually, it had been sorted out in 1746, it was all fine.

00:10:35.100 --> 00:10:37.700
 If you didn't mention Barrack upon Tweed, there was no problem.

00:10:37.700 --> 00:10:39.020
 It was still included.

00:10:39.020 --> 00:10:40.980
 But the town, no one really knew that.

00:10:40.980 --> 00:10:41.980
 It didn't sort of get through.

00:10:41.980 --> 00:10:45.620
 So people kept naming it in official documents as a kind of just in case.

00:10:45.620 --> 00:10:47.620
 They couldn't remember whether it was included.

00:10:47.620 --> 00:10:53.220
 So people thought that they had been left out and that they were still at war with Russia.

00:10:53.220 --> 00:10:54.540
 And this is the really sweet thing.

00:10:54.540 --> 00:10:59.140
 In 2006, there was a kind of exhibition about this in the town, about this interesting,

00:10:59.140 --> 00:11:00.940
 you know, King of History.

00:11:00.940 --> 00:11:03.660
 And it was Barrack's war with Russia weekend.

00:11:03.660 --> 00:11:09.460
 And apparently, as part of it, they had a Wattif reenactment, which I think is the best.

00:11:09.460 --> 00:11:13.260
 Surely the Wattif in Wattif was Barrack being flattened within 30 seconds.

00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:17.620
 Russia going about his business.

00:11:17.620 --> 00:11:20.860
 I was just looking a little bit at the declaration of the Second World War.

00:11:20.860 --> 00:11:24.540
 And the Second World War was kind of declared by two Nevels.

00:11:24.540 --> 00:11:25.540
 So it was not really...

00:11:25.540 --> 00:11:26.540
 Oh, really?

00:11:26.540 --> 00:11:27.540
 Was it?

00:11:27.540 --> 00:11:30.580
 It wasn't Gary in film, though.

00:11:30.580 --> 00:11:32.620
 It was, obviously, there was Chamberlain.

00:11:32.620 --> 00:11:34.300
 But then there was also Neville Henderson.

00:11:34.300 --> 00:11:36.420
 He was the British ambassador in Germany.

00:11:36.420 --> 00:11:39.660
 So it was his job to go and actually tell the Germans that we were at war.

00:11:39.660 --> 00:11:43.220
 But it might have been because of a mistake, again, a little bit like this era.

00:11:43.220 --> 00:11:44.460
 In 1914.

00:11:44.460 --> 00:11:47.060
 So it was August the 30th in 1939.

00:11:47.060 --> 00:11:52.180
 And Henderson went and met Ribbon Drop, who was their Hitler's prime secretary.

00:11:52.180 --> 00:11:53.900
 And apparently, things got really tense.

00:11:53.900 --> 00:11:56.500
 You know, Henderson was saying, "Please stop invading all these countries.

00:11:56.500 --> 00:11:58.460
 Please don't do the Poland thing."

00:11:58.460 --> 00:12:00.060
 And it came really close to blows.

00:12:00.060 --> 00:12:02.060
 They almost started punching each other.

00:12:02.060 --> 00:12:05.940
 And then Ribbon Drop said, "Okay, we're going to give you our last offer.

00:12:05.940 --> 00:12:07.980
 We're going to give Poland the last offer."

00:12:07.980 --> 00:12:12.380
 And Britain was, obviously, basically represented Poland at this point.

00:12:12.380 --> 00:12:16.340
 And so Ribbon Drop read over the last offer, but Henderson's really pissed off with Ribbon Drop

00:12:16.340 --> 00:12:17.340
 at this point.

00:12:17.340 --> 00:12:18.340
 So he didn't really listen.

00:12:18.340 --> 00:12:21.220
 And Ribbon Drop read over it really, really fast, sped through it apparently.

00:12:21.220 --> 00:12:23.740
 And then Henderson went, "Okay, fine, give me the copy."

00:12:23.740 --> 00:12:26.340
 And Ribbon Drop said, "No, not going to give you the copy.

00:12:26.340 --> 00:12:28.020
 Hope you were paying attention."

00:12:28.020 --> 00:12:31.500
 And so Henderson didn't know what had just happened, didn't really know what the offer

00:12:31.500 --> 00:12:32.500
 was.

00:12:32.500 --> 00:12:33.980
 It was kind of deliberately convoluted.

00:12:33.980 --> 00:12:37.140
 And then Ribbon Drop said, "You've got to respond by midnight."

00:12:37.140 --> 00:12:38.460
 And this confused everything.

00:12:38.460 --> 00:12:40.740
 And within a couple of days, there was war.

00:12:40.740 --> 00:12:41.740
 Wow.

00:12:41.740 --> 00:12:42.740
 Yeah.

00:12:42.740 --> 00:12:43.740
 So always pay attention.

00:12:43.740 --> 00:12:44.740
 Yeah.

00:12:44.740 --> 00:12:46.740
 I don't think that's a message.

00:12:46.740 --> 00:12:48.740
 So who was Ribbon Drop?

00:12:48.740 --> 00:12:54.700
 I can see you all switch off, then, and we've gone to war.

00:12:54.700 --> 00:13:03.940
 Okay, it is time for fact number two, and that is James.

00:13:03.940 --> 00:13:09.540
 Okay, my fact this week is that there's a bacterium that can freeze water just by touching

00:13:09.540 --> 00:13:10.540
 it.

00:13:10.540 --> 00:13:14.460
 And these bacteria are used to make artificial snow in ski resorts.

00:13:14.460 --> 00:13:15.460
 That was crazy.

00:13:15.460 --> 00:13:16.460
 It's amazing.

00:13:16.460 --> 00:13:17.460
 It's amazing.

00:13:17.460 --> 00:13:18.460
 It's not fast.

00:13:18.460 --> 00:13:23.060
 If I dropped one of these bacteria into my glass of water, is it frozen straight away?

00:13:23.060 --> 00:13:24.060
 No.

00:13:24.060 --> 00:13:27.260
 So it tends to do it with plants.

00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:32.180
 It goes into the plant cells and it freezes the water in the plant cells so it can access

00:13:32.180 --> 00:13:34.620
 the nutrients inside the plants.

00:13:34.620 --> 00:13:38.260
 But the way that it does it is it has a protein on the outside of the bacterium, and they

00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:44.620
 can shift the molecules around of the water, and the water then orders it, like, kind of

00:13:44.620 --> 00:13:48.180
 gets into a lattice into a template, which is what ice is, really.

00:13:48.180 --> 00:13:51.900
 And then it can also remove heat from the water in the same way that a refrigerator removes

00:13:51.900 --> 00:13:54.660
 heat from the inside of it.

00:13:54.660 --> 00:13:59.060
 So it gets hotter, but it removes heat from the water itself to make it into ice.

00:13:59.060 --> 00:14:01.060
 And the plants don't like that, presumably.

00:14:01.060 --> 00:14:04.460
 The plants do not like being killed, no.

00:14:04.460 --> 00:14:08.700
 There's actually any frost damage that you see is usually down to this bacteria.

00:14:08.700 --> 00:14:09.700
 Really?

00:14:09.700 --> 00:14:10.700
 Yeah.

00:14:10.700 --> 00:14:15.100
 So if you have a plant at, say, minus four degrees minus three or four degrees, it should

00:14:15.100 --> 00:14:17.700
 be fine because the water inside it can super cool.

00:14:17.700 --> 00:14:20.140
 It won't turn to ice until a little bit later than that.

00:14:20.140 --> 00:14:25.100
 But if it has this bacterium in it, then the bacteria will turn the water, which would have

00:14:25.100 --> 00:14:27.580
 been liquid into ice and it can kill the plants.

00:14:27.580 --> 00:14:28.580
 Bastard.

00:14:28.580 --> 00:14:29.580
 Bastard.

00:14:29.580 --> 00:14:30.580
 Bastard.

00:14:30.580 --> 00:14:32.540
 What I find is the same, sorry.

00:14:32.540 --> 00:14:38.860
 What I find amazing is that this is being used in artificial snow making as in you must have

00:14:38.860 --> 00:14:44.820
 to have so many hundreds and hundreds of millions and billions of these bacteria to make lots

00:14:44.820 --> 00:14:45.820
 of artificial snow.

00:14:45.820 --> 00:14:46.820
 How do you breed?

00:14:46.820 --> 00:14:47.820
 I guess they just, they just reduced.

00:14:47.820 --> 00:14:48.820
 They just reduced.

00:14:48.820 --> 00:14:49.820
 They breed so bacteria.

00:14:49.820 --> 00:14:52.380
 You just leave one alone for 20 hours and then you go back to the beginning.

00:14:52.380 --> 00:14:53.380
 Well, yeah, that's the thing.

00:14:53.380 --> 00:14:59.540
 I read a single-cell bacteria in a 12-hour period they can produce 70 billion bacteria

00:14:59.540 --> 00:15:00.780
 from a single-cell bacteria.

00:15:00.780 --> 00:15:01.780
 It's a good question.

00:15:01.780 --> 00:15:02.780
 It breaks that process.

00:15:02.780 --> 00:15:03.780
 It breaks that process.

00:15:03.780 --> 00:15:04.780
 So small, isn't it?

00:15:04.780 --> 00:15:06.940
 Because if they were like human size, overcrowding of the world would have happened in

00:15:06.940 --> 00:15:07.940
 a second.

00:15:07.940 --> 00:15:08.940
 Yeah, definitely.

00:15:08.940 --> 00:15:11.820
 And that, think of all those generations.

00:15:11.820 --> 00:15:15.380
 That's one great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, grandfather who has

00:15:15.380 --> 00:15:16.380
 70 billion.

00:15:16.380 --> 00:15:17.380
 Oh, God.

00:15:17.380 --> 00:15:18.380
 How do you think you are?

00:15:18.380 --> 00:15:19.380
 How do you think you are?

00:15:19.380 --> 00:15:20.380
 How do you think you are?

00:15:20.380 --> 00:15:21.380
 How do you think you are?

00:15:21.380 --> 00:15:22.380
 How do you think you are?

00:15:22.380 --> 00:15:23.380
 How do you think you are?

00:15:23.380 --> 00:15:24.380
 How do you think you are?

00:15:24.380 --> 00:15:25.380
 How do you think you are?

00:15:25.380 --> 00:15:26.380
 How do you think you are?

00:15:26.380 --> 00:15:27.380
 How do you think you are?

00:15:27.380 --> 00:15:28.380
 How do you think you are?

00:15:28.380 --> 00:15:29.380
 They can do it even after they're dead.

00:15:29.380 --> 00:15:30.380
 Wow.

00:15:30.380 --> 00:15:34.900
 Like snowmacks who make this artificial snow, they get dead bacteria, because the bacteria

00:15:34.900 --> 00:15:39.700
 still have the protein on their outside, which can make the water turn into ice, even though

00:15:39.700 --> 00:15:40.700
 they're not alive anymore.

00:15:40.700 --> 00:15:41.700
 Wow.

00:15:41.700 --> 00:15:47.860
 It's not a great PR line though, is it, using the dead corpses of billions of bacteria?

00:15:47.860 --> 00:15:52.580
 Well, the thing is, real rain probably has these guys in it as well.

00:15:52.580 --> 00:15:58.220
 So most real rain or snow has to have some kind of nucleus, which the water goes around.

00:15:58.220 --> 00:16:02.180
 And they think that, generally speaking, it's this particular bacteria that's most common

00:16:02.180 --> 00:16:03.740
 in rain around the world.

00:16:03.740 --> 00:16:04.740
 Really?

00:16:04.740 --> 00:16:08.660
 Because all rain starts sort of frozen up there, but then how is the bacteria not able

00:16:08.660 --> 00:16:12.140
 to freeze it as well once it's in rain form down with us?

00:16:12.140 --> 00:16:14.300
 Yes, because there'll be two warm at that stage.

00:16:14.300 --> 00:16:16.820
 The bacteria only really works around the zero mark.

00:16:16.820 --> 00:16:17.820
 Got it.

00:16:17.820 --> 00:16:19.420
 And the things are kind of freezing anyway, but you know.

00:16:19.420 --> 00:16:25.620
 That's why you don't get many ski slopes in places like Barbados, because the bacteria

00:16:25.620 --> 00:16:26.620
 can't do it in the heat.

00:16:26.620 --> 00:16:28.900
 Have you guys heard of the British gut project?

00:16:28.900 --> 00:16:29.900
 No.

00:16:29.900 --> 00:16:34.340
 So I was looking at microbiomes and how there's a theory that your bacteria in your stomach

00:16:34.340 --> 00:16:35.340
 can affect your mood.

00:16:35.340 --> 00:16:40.540
 So they don't experiments on mice where mice with no microbes in them got twice as stressed

00:16:40.540 --> 00:16:43.860
 when scientists freak them out as normal mice did with normal microbiomes.

00:16:43.860 --> 00:16:45.620
 So there's a theory there.

00:16:45.620 --> 00:16:50.900
 But the British gut project is this enterprise which is trying to map the whole gut microbiome

00:16:50.900 --> 00:16:52.740
 of the British population.

00:16:52.740 --> 00:16:56.420
 And they're basically crowdsourcing poo in the post.

00:16:56.420 --> 00:16:57.420
 In the post?

00:16:57.420 --> 00:16:58.420
 Yeah.

00:16:58.420 --> 00:16:59.660
 But you do have to pay.

00:16:59.660 --> 00:17:01.140
 You can't just send them poo in the post.

00:17:01.140 --> 00:17:02.140
 So there's crowd.

00:17:02.140 --> 00:17:05.260
 How much do I have to pay to put poo in the post?

00:17:05.260 --> 00:17:11.380
 It's 75 quid, but they are trying to build up this whole picture of the nation's microbiome

00:17:11.380 --> 00:17:12.380
 health.

00:17:12.380 --> 00:17:14.220
 They've been done it, tried in America already.

00:17:14.220 --> 00:17:18.300
 And it's really interesting seeing a whole population's general health.

00:17:18.300 --> 00:17:19.900
 So they're trying to sequence the DNA.

00:17:19.900 --> 00:17:22.020
 So they will send you a breakdown of your own DNA.

00:17:22.020 --> 00:17:25.660
 But it's not going to be a good method to find out the population's health because you're

00:17:25.660 --> 00:17:29.100
 only going to get the weirdos, you're willing to shit in an envelope and send it to your

00:17:29.100 --> 00:17:30.100
 solitus.

00:17:30.100 --> 00:17:34.860
 I can't help but say, if you're upset with the British gut project, how do you show your

00:17:34.860 --> 00:17:35.860
 displeasure?

00:17:35.860 --> 00:17:37.060
 Because you can't send it anywhere in the post.

00:17:37.060 --> 00:17:40.660
 You send them an empty sample part of the poll and poo.

00:17:40.660 --> 00:17:41.660
 Wow.

00:17:41.660 --> 00:17:44.660
 We're sending them your poo though, because half imagine getting a thing about going, you're

00:17:44.660 --> 00:17:45.660
 50% corn.

00:17:45.660 --> 00:17:50.780
 You know, just anything that's, I don't think that's how sequencing DNA will help.

00:17:50.780 --> 00:17:59.340
 You know when they say that humans and cons, like 75% of the DNA is those guys.

00:17:59.340 --> 00:18:02.740
 In China, it's smuggy, I read.

00:18:02.740 --> 00:18:08.140
 And there are bacteria that live on the smug, so they live inside the smug and they can

00:18:08.140 --> 00:18:09.140
 eat the smug.

00:18:09.140 --> 00:18:12.860
 And that sounds like quite cool, doesn't it, because maybe it gets rid of the smug.

00:18:12.860 --> 00:18:18.500
 But unfortunately, they fart out even worse chemicals.

00:18:18.500 --> 00:18:20.660
 So you're just replacing one police with another.

00:18:20.660 --> 00:18:23.580
 Do we not have another kind of bacteria that can eat the worst chemicals?

00:18:23.580 --> 00:18:26.220
 I get the feeling that they'll fart something worse after that.

00:18:26.220 --> 00:18:27.820
 That's really fun.

00:18:27.820 --> 00:18:37.140
 OK, it's time for fact number three, and that is Chazinsky.

00:18:37.140 --> 00:18:41.980
 My fight is that women who were applying to be Qing Dynasty concubines had to spend a

00:18:41.980 --> 00:18:46.220
 night sleeping with the Emperor's mother first, so that she could check they didn't

00:18:46.220 --> 00:18:47.220
 snore.

00:18:47.220 --> 00:18:54.060
 Yeah, so the selection process to be a concubine was so arduous, and there were so many steps

00:18:54.060 --> 00:18:55.060
 to it.

00:18:55.060 --> 00:18:58.580
 This is actually in this amazing thing that's on the south, it's been published by the South

00:18:58.580 --> 00:19:02.780
 China Morning Post, but it's in collaboration with the Forbidden Palace Museum, and I would

00:19:02.780 --> 00:19:03.780
 so recommend it.

00:19:03.780 --> 00:19:07.580
 They've done a series of chapters detailing life in the Forbidden City.

00:19:07.580 --> 00:19:11.140
 And this is about, yeah, so there were these concubines who lived in the Forbidden City with

00:19:11.140 --> 00:19:12.340
 the Emperor.

00:19:12.340 --> 00:19:17.860
 And to become one, you had to, well, first of all, every single Manchu woman in the kingdom

00:19:17.860 --> 00:19:22.380
 had to apply to become a concubine, so you weren't allowed to marry until you'd applied

00:19:22.380 --> 00:19:24.420
 to check the Emperor didn't want to marry you.

00:19:24.420 --> 00:19:29.500
 This was all girls between 13 and 16, and they did this sort of call out every three years.

00:19:29.500 --> 00:19:33.060
 And then they'd come, and God knows how they whittled it down from that many, but they

00:19:33.060 --> 00:19:37.060
 whittled it down to about a hundred who would be monitored really, really carefully by

00:19:37.060 --> 00:19:39.580
 all these females already in the Forbidden City.

00:19:39.580 --> 00:19:46.260
 So for things like in squid, skin abnormalities, body odor, they were really strict on body

00:19:46.260 --> 00:19:49.300
 odor, and anything else that might be wrong with them.

00:19:49.300 --> 00:19:52.660
 And then they were whittled down to finalists who were kind of taught like a finishing school

00:19:52.660 --> 00:19:53.660
 how to behave.

00:19:53.660 --> 00:19:54.660
 It's very much like the X-Factor, isn't it?

00:19:54.660 --> 00:19:55.660
 It is.

00:19:55.660 --> 00:19:56.660
 It's so X-Factor.

00:19:56.660 --> 00:19:57.660
 Yeah.

00:19:57.660 --> 00:19:58.660
 Although they don't do the body odor thing.

00:19:58.660 --> 00:20:04.140
 The X-Factor spend a night sleeping next to Simon Carroll.

00:20:04.140 --> 00:20:06.420
 But I know how they whittled it down.

00:20:06.420 --> 00:20:08.740
 It was in that brilliant piece.

00:20:08.740 --> 00:20:10.300
 So when the Ming dynasty--

00:20:10.300 --> 00:20:11.460
 Which is the one just before?

00:20:11.460 --> 00:20:12.460
 Yes.

00:20:12.460 --> 00:20:13.940
 We've got records of how they whittled it down.

00:20:13.940 --> 00:20:18.860
 So they picked 5,000 young women, and then they eliminated 1,000 on the first day for being

00:20:18.860 --> 00:20:20.860
 too short or tall or fat or thin.

00:20:20.860 --> 00:20:25.460
 And the second day, they got rid of another 2,000 based on their voices and general manner.

00:20:25.460 --> 00:20:26.460
 You got 2,000 left.

00:20:26.460 --> 00:20:28.820
 Well, that is actually like X-Factor, isn't it?

00:20:28.820 --> 00:20:29.820
 Yeah.

00:20:29.820 --> 00:20:30.820
 It's true.

00:20:30.820 --> 00:20:34.260
 And third day, they got rid of another 1,000 because their hands or feet weren't right.

00:20:34.260 --> 00:20:35.260
 I haven't seen--

00:20:35.260 --> 00:20:38.420
 I haven't seen the X-Factor, but I don't think that that fades in.

00:20:38.420 --> 00:20:39.500
 So you've got 1,000 left.

00:20:39.500 --> 00:20:40.500
 Yeah, foot inspection.

00:20:40.500 --> 00:20:41.780
 Foot inspection was a massive thing.

00:20:41.780 --> 00:20:42.780
 Yeah.

00:20:42.780 --> 00:20:43.780
 Feet are so important.

00:20:43.780 --> 00:20:44.780
 Feet are so important.

00:20:44.780 --> 00:20:45.780
 Yeah.

00:20:45.780 --> 00:20:46.780
 Then you've got 1,000 left.

00:20:46.780 --> 00:20:48.780
 And then you have gynecological examinations, which apparently get rid of another 700.

00:20:48.780 --> 00:20:49.780
 Wow.

00:20:49.780 --> 00:20:50.780
 I do not know how.

00:20:50.780 --> 00:20:55.380
 I've got to say, I kind of at this stage wish I'd been kicked out for being too tall short

00:20:55.380 --> 00:20:57.380
 fat or thin.

00:20:57.380 --> 00:21:00.020
 And then you have a month of testing for the remaining 300.

00:21:00.020 --> 00:21:01.020
 Yeah.

00:21:01.020 --> 00:21:04.980
 But in that final month, is it right that they get taught sort of incredible skills that

00:21:04.980 --> 00:21:08.700
 they might not have learnt painting, reading, walking.

00:21:08.700 --> 00:21:09.700
 Yeah.

00:21:09.700 --> 00:21:10.700
 It was very much my fault.

00:21:10.700 --> 00:21:12.220
 What kind of walking walking walk?

00:21:12.220 --> 00:21:17.140
 One of those skills that you'd never learned, unless you were in Alice, who walked back into

00:21:17.140 --> 00:21:18.220
 your village, you've changed.

00:21:18.220 --> 00:21:21.420
 [LAUGHTER]

00:21:21.420 --> 00:21:23.420
 Everyone else were rolling around.

00:21:23.420 --> 00:21:24.420
 [LAUGHTER]

00:21:24.420 --> 00:21:25.900
 Oh, she thinks she's so off herself.

00:21:25.900 --> 00:21:27.420
 [LAUGHTER]

00:21:27.420 --> 00:21:30.660
 That was a book that was saying they were taught to have.

00:21:30.660 --> 00:21:33.540
 They had to have dainty feet, and they were taught to have a titillating walk.

00:21:33.540 --> 00:21:34.540
 Yeah.

00:21:34.540 --> 00:21:40.780
 But yeah, and sleeping next to the mother, the mother was the final herd, or you had to cross,

00:21:40.780 --> 00:21:42.300
 and she was the senior woman.

00:21:42.300 --> 00:21:43.300
 [LAUGHTER]

00:21:43.300 --> 00:21:44.300
 What a boss level.

00:21:44.300 --> 00:21:45.300
 [LAUGHTER]

00:21:45.300 --> 00:21:48.580
 How many, do you know, got through to that final phase?

00:21:48.580 --> 00:21:52.980
 I think the finalists, they were 10, I think, or maybe they were 5 at that point, but we were

00:21:52.980 --> 00:21:53.980
 down to a manageable number.

00:21:53.980 --> 00:21:57.780
 Because the mother doesn't have, you know, there's only one Emperor's mum, so she can't

00:21:57.780 --> 00:22:02.060
 spend all her time unless she sleeps with them all at the same time, but then how do you

00:22:02.060 --> 00:22:03.060
 know who's sorry?

00:22:03.060 --> 00:22:04.060
 Yeah.

00:22:04.060 --> 00:22:05.060
 Oh, yes.

00:22:05.060 --> 00:22:06.780
 You just blame it on the person next to you.

00:22:06.780 --> 00:22:09.420
 And it was to check for things like sleepwalking or sleep talking.

00:22:09.420 --> 00:22:12.540
 All body odors again, she had to be very careful with.

00:22:12.540 --> 00:22:13.540
 And then you passed.

00:22:13.540 --> 00:22:16.940
 But a lot of girls in one part, obviously, because it meant that you had to abandon your village

00:22:16.940 --> 00:22:20.820
 and your family and all your friends and live forever in this massive urban city with

00:22:20.820 --> 00:22:21.820
 this creepy old man.

00:22:21.820 --> 00:22:22.820
 So.

00:22:22.820 --> 00:22:23.820
 Yeah.

00:22:23.820 --> 00:22:27.060
 You might not come and see you, though, because when the lots of concubines, some of them

00:22:27.060 --> 00:22:28.060
 had tons, didn't they?

00:22:28.060 --> 00:22:29.060
 I think.

00:22:29.060 --> 00:22:30.060
 Yeah, you had different levels.

00:22:30.060 --> 00:22:33.860
 You had your base level concubine, and then it went to higher rankings all the way up to

00:22:33.860 --> 00:22:35.540
 your, the Empress boss level.

00:22:35.540 --> 00:22:36.540
 Yeah.

00:22:36.540 --> 00:22:37.540
 Exactly.

00:22:37.540 --> 00:22:39.340
 And there were about 20,000 by the chain dynasty.

00:22:39.340 --> 00:22:40.340
 20,000 concubines.

00:22:40.340 --> 00:22:42.140
 Concubines, consorts.

00:22:42.140 --> 00:22:43.140
 Yeah.

00:22:43.140 --> 00:22:44.140
 Blimey.

00:22:44.140 --> 00:22:45.140
 Where would it be?

00:22:45.140 --> 00:22:46.140
 20,000 women in this urban city.

00:22:46.140 --> 00:22:47.140
 I have some women.

00:22:47.140 --> 00:22:50.340
 I'm just trying to work out the timings of this.

00:22:50.340 --> 00:22:51.340
 What?

00:22:51.340 --> 00:22:52.340
 How?

00:22:52.340 --> 00:22:55.940
 How, like, let's say, how many, how many you can have sex with in that amount of time?

00:22:55.940 --> 00:22:56.940
 Got us.

00:22:56.940 --> 00:22:57.940
 Yeah.

00:22:57.940 --> 00:22:58.940
 You know, to be frank.

00:22:58.940 --> 00:22:59.940
 Well, they did have problems with that.

00:22:59.940 --> 00:23:05.940
 It was one emperor called Emperor Wu, not part of the Qing, but he had 5,000 women, too many

00:23:05.940 --> 00:23:11.220
 to either remember who he actually wanted to sleep with, but he knew that they were all

00:23:11.220 --> 00:23:12.220
 very pretty.

00:23:12.220 --> 00:23:15.700
 So what he used to do was go around in a cart that was carried by goats.

00:23:15.700 --> 00:23:19.620
 And when the goats got tired, wherever they parked, that's who he went and had sex with

00:23:19.620 --> 00:23:20.620
 that night.

00:23:20.620 --> 00:23:21.620
 Yeah.

00:23:21.620 --> 00:23:22.620
 That's...

00:23:22.620 --> 00:23:24.660
 Surely there's an easier way to remember who you fancy.

00:23:24.660 --> 00:23:25.860
 He fancied them all, I think.

00:23:25.860 --> 00:23:26.860
 That's the idea.

00:23:26.860 --> 00:23:29.300
 As the concubines, he just thought they're all very beautiful.

00:23:29.300 --> 00:23:31.980
 So wherever the goats stop, that's where I'll get off.

00:23:31.980 --> 00:23:35.980
 And some of the concubines he had cheated.

00:23:35.980 --> 00:23:40.220
 And many of the concubines actually did want to have relations with him because maybe it

00:23:40.220 --> 00:23:42.500
 brought children and they would become emperors.

00:23:42.500 --> 00:23:43.500
 Exactly.

00:23:43.500 --> 00:23:47.420
 So what they used to do was leave little bits of treats outside the door for the goats to

00:23:47.420 --> 00:23:50.860
 trick them into stopping.

00:23:50.860 --> 00:23:55.220
 And then there's other ones who, because they wanted to make sure that there was not too

00:23:55.220 --> 00:23:59.220
 much jealousy amongst the concubines, because if you slept with one of the concubines,

00:23:59.220 --> 00:24:04.300
 that raised her level and suddenly your surrounding concubines might get a bit too jealous and fights

00:24:04.300 --> 00:24:09.460
 break out and so on, they used to have a rotation calendar that was done for certain emperors.

00:24:09.460 --> 00:24:13.460
 So they would make sure that you never slept with the same concubine in the same week or something

00:24:13.460 --> 00:24:14.460
 like that.

00:24:14.460 --> 00:24:15.460
 Sure, right.

00:24:15.460 --> 00:24:16.460
 And we'd have written records of that.

00:24:16.460 --> 00:24:20.660
 So I read on this website, Anna, that you were talking about, that in the 10th century

00:24:20.660 --> 00:24:25.420
 calendars, we used to keep track of the sex life rather than of dates of day life.

00:24:25.420 --> 00:24:26.420
 Yes.

00:24:26.420 --> 00:24:27.420
 It was so closely monitored.

00:24:27.420 --> 00:24:34.820
 You're not saying I'll meet you on the 29th of the Emperor's Shagging Rachel.

00:24:34.820 --> 00:24:38.980
 And I think we should bring it back in our royal family.

00:24:38.980 --> 00:24:45.060
 Yeah, there was a branch of the Imperial Government that was set up in the 1670s called the

00:24:45.060 --> 00:24:47.060
 Office of Respectful Service.

00:24:47.060 --> 00:24:51.700
 And this was to formalise that really and make sure secretaries were installed to keep tabs

00:24:51.700 --> 00:24:53.900
 on the sexual activities.

00:24:53.900 --> 00:24:57.580
 And so every single concubine that visited the bedroom, they'd have to take note of it,

00:24:57.580 --> 00:25:00.220
 they'd have to find out what actually happened in there.

00:25:00.220 --> 00:25:04.020
 Because again, the ranking system, you haven't had any much.

00:25:04.020 --> 00:25:05.860
 I found this interesting.

00:25:05.860 --> 00:25:11.020
 Apparently there was only one monogamous Chinese emperor who was called Hong Xi.

00:25:11.020 --> 00:25:14.100
 And he was only monogamous because he was extremely close to his mother.

00:25:14.100 --> 00:25:16.300
 And then his mother was murdered by a concubine.

00:25:16.300 --> 00:25:18.700
 So that rather put him off the idea of concubines.

00:25:18.700 --> 00:25:19.700
 Or concubines.

00:25:19.700 --> 00:25:20.700
 Yeah.

00:25:20.700 --> 00:25:21.980
 Except the one, presumably.

00:25:21.980 --> 00:25:23.980
 I think he took a wife.

00:25:23.980 --> 00:25:24.980
 He took a wife.

00:25:24.980 --> 00:25:25.980
 Yeah.

00:25:25.980 --> 00:25:26.980
 They could do that sometimes.

00:25:26.980 --> 00:25:27.980
 Couldn't they concubines?

00:25:27.980 --> 00:25:31.900
 There was an emperor called Xi-A-Sing, which I'm sure I'm pronouncing wrong.

00:25:31.900 --> 00:25:36.100
 But 18 of his concubines kind of ganged up on him and tried to kill him.

00:25:36.100 --> 00:25:40.860
 They drove herpins into his crotch and they wrapped a silk cord around his neck and tried

00:25:40.860 --> 00:25:41.860
 to strangle him.

00:25:41.860 --> 00:25:42.860
 Wow.

00:25:42.860 --> 00:25:51.580
 The guy with the clipboard in the corner saying, "I don't know what I record this at."

00:25:51.580 --> 00:25:53.580
 Maybe heavy pressing?

00:25:53.580 --> 00:25:58.940
 Well, the Empress, emphrasifying, then had all the conspirators killed.

00:25:58.940 --> 00:26:00.700
 They're all executed.

00:26:00.700 --> 00:26:07.460
 But Xi-A-Sing, he decided to move out of the Imperial Palace and became a Taoist magician

00:26:07.460 --> 00:26:12.780
 who spent his whole life having sex with virgins and drinking magic potions made from bodily

00:26:12.780 --> 00:26:13.780
 fluids.

00:26:13.780 --> 00:26:14.780
 Wow.

00:26:14.780 --> 00:26:15.780
 He infected him quite badly.

00:26:15.780 --> 00:26:16.780
 It's, yeah.

00:26:16.780 --> 00:26:17.780
 Is that...

00:26:17.780 --> 00:26:18.780
 And that council is being a magician?

00:26:18.780 --> 00:26:22.940
 It's only been disappointed if I went to a magic show and all he did was drink blood and urine

00:26:22.940 --> 00:26:24.940
 and have sex with virgins.

00:26:24.940 --> 00:26:29.180
 You've clearly never been to a day of a blind track.

00:26:29.180 --> 00:26:31.020
 I think the magic was other stuff.

00:26:31.020 --> 00:26:32.020
 Right.

00:26:32.020 --> 00:26:33.820
 Did he stay as emperor?

00:26:33.820 --> 00:26:37.120
 He did, but basically he just ignored all of his duties that he was supposed to do as

00:26:37.120 --> 00:26:38.120
 emperor.

00:26:38.120 --> 00:26:39.120
 Wow.

00:26:39.120 --> 00:26:40.120
 And did all this magic and...

00:26:40.120 --> 00:26:41.120
 I'm so annoying.

00:26:41.120 --> 00:26:42.120
 I'm so annoying.

00:26:42.120 --> 00:26:45.260
 If the Empress had got a magic show, he'd be constantly trying to show you another trick.

00:26:45.260 --> 00:26:52.260
 I'm saying that we are at war with four separate groups of people, could we have some decisions,

00:26:52.260 --> 00:26:53.260
 please?

00:26:53.260 --> 00:26:55.460
 Oh, pick a card.

00:26:55.460 --> 00:26:59.340
 Just on Unix, so because they were the other group of people that were allowed in the

00:26:59.340 --> 00:27:03.420
 Forbidden City, you couldn't have men with their parts because then they might impregnate

00:27:03.420 --> 00:27:04.420
 the women.

00:27:04.420 --> 00:27:08.500
 So there were thousands and thousands of Unix and it was actually a good gig because it's

00:27:08.500 --> 00:27:12.460
 the only way you can work really close to the emperor in his government.

00:27:12.460 --> 00:27:15.580
 But I think there was one drawback.

00:27:15.580 --> 00:27:19.540
 The application process was a bit tedious.

00:27:19.540 --> 00:27:26.660
 Imagine if they chop your cock off and then they said, "Sorry, you snore."

00:27:26.660 --> 00:27:31.660
 But the way they did it was they put you on a chair with a hole in the seat.

00:27:31.660 --> 00:27:32.660
 Oh, really?

00:27:32.660 --> 00:27:36.300
 And then you just whip something underneath it and it's gone.

00:27:36.300 --> 00:27:38.300
 I mean, it was the testicles that were really...

00:27:38.300 --> 00:27:39.300
 It was the piece of hole.

00:27:39.300 --> 00:27:40.300
 It was the piece of hole.

00:27:40.300 --> 00:27:41.300
 Yes, yeah.

00:27:41.300 --> 00:27:42.300
 You got to get rid of it.

00:27:42.300 --> 00:27:45.660
 And I think we've said they used to then have to carry them around in a pouch we've mentioned

00:27:45.660 --> 00:27:46.660
 before.

00:27:46.660 --> 00:27:51.420
 Which they were proud of, the last Unix of China, fell out with his family when they threw

00:27:51.420 --> 00:27:52.740
 his genitals away.

00:27:52.740 --> 00:27:55.220
 The Unix never spoke to his family again off the back.

00:27:55.220 --> 00:27:56.220
 I think that's fair enough.

00:27:56.220 --> 00:27:59.300
 I would be so annoyed if my mum threw away a body part of mine.

00:27:59.300 --> 00:28:00.300
 Yes.

00:28:00.300 --> 00:28:02.580
 Your car is on or off.

00:28:02.580 --> 00:28:06.820
 When you go back to visit your parents and they've like changed your bedroom and they turn

00:28:06.820 --> 00:28:07.820
 into a study or something.

00:28:07.820 --> 00:28:08.820
 Yeah.

00:28:08.820 --> 00:28:09.820
 That's really upsetting.

00:28:09.820 --> 00:28:10.820
 Yeah, that's true.

00:28:10.820 --> 00:28:15.540
 So the reason they threw it away is because during the cultural revolution there was a whole

00:28:15.540 --> 00:28:19.780
 thing about you need to discard anything that was seen as old society.

00:28:19.780 --> 00:28:23.860
 And if you had anything that was old society, yeah, you put your whole family at risk because

00:28:23.860 --> 00:28:25.580
 you own something from...

00:28:25.580 --> 00:28:28.580
 So they saw his genitals as part of that tradition.

00:28:28.580 --> 00:28:29.580
 Oh my goodness.

00:28:29.580 --> 00:28:30.580
 Yeah, so they threw it away.

00:28:30.580 --> 00:28:31.580
 That's amazing.

00:28:31.580 --> 00:28:32.580
 And think about his life.

00:28:32.580 --> 00:28:33.580
 This guy, Sonia Teng, the last Unix.

00:28:33.580 --> 00:28:34.580
 He died in 1996.

00:28:34.580 --> 00:28:35.580
 Yeah.

00:28:35.580 --> 00:28:36.580
 Wow.

00:28:36.580 --> 00:28:37.580
 Really recent history.

00:28:37.580 --> 00:28:38.580
 Yeah.

00:28:38.580 --> 00:28:43.500
 I don't know how you pronounce that word, but Conky Binage, Conky Binage, was only banned

00:28:43.500 --> 00:28:44.820
 in Hong Kong in 1972.

00:28:44.820 --> 00:28:45.820
 Wow.

00:28:45.820 --> 00:28:46.820
 Yeah.

00:28:46.820 --> 00:28:48.580
 And it's still not uncommon, I think.

00:28:48.580 --> 00:28:52.500
 It's not as frowned upon to have lots of mistresses in our parts of China.

00:28:52.500 --> 00:28:56.940
 And there's a saying in China, well, someone who's Chinese on the internet said, "We've got

00:28:56.940 --> 00:29:00.820
 a popular saying," which explains why Chinese men need multiple women.

00:29:00.820 --> 00:29:03.860
 But women are expected to just have one man.

00:29:03.860 --> 00:29:07.540
 And it goes, "One teapot is usually accompanied by four cups.

00:29:07.540 --> 00:29:10.980
 Have you ever seen one cup with four teapots?"

00:29:10.980 --> 00:29:14.540
 Sounds similar to something I have seen on the internet, but...

00:29:14.540 --> 00:29:15.540
 Oh!

00:29:15.540 --> 00:29:19.500
 Two conkybings, one cup, so I can't say that.

00:29:19.500 --> 00:29:23.780
 Completely different, but equally profound meaning to that.

00:29:23.780 --> 00:29:27.740
 Conkybinging sounds like an old, old Netflix kind of.

00:29:27.740 --> 00:29:28.980
 It's not conkybinging.

00:29:28.980 --> 00:29:32.140
 Conkybinging just sounds like you're chucking them out.

00:29:32.140 --> 00:29:37.500
 Oh, well, there is a good argument for conkybinging because there's a new TV show in China

00:29:37.500 --> 00:29:42.140
 which is about Yangtze Palace, and it's hugely popular.

00:29:42.140 --> 00:29:46.860
 It's the most Googled TV show of the year 2018, despite the fact that Google is largely banned

00:29:46.860 --> 00:29:47.860
 in China.

00:29:47.860 --> 00:29:51.860
 That's how hugely popular it is, all across Asia, lots of other countries as well.

00:29:51.860 --> 00:29:58.580
 It's been streamed 15 billion times, and it's about a rivalry between conkybines in the

00:29:58.580 --> 00:29:59.580
 forbidden city.

00:29:59.580 --> 00:30:02.940
 So conkybinging is actually a perfect word for watching the show.

00:30:02.940 --> 00:30:06.700
 15 billion, that means everyone on average has watched it twice.

00:30:06.700 --> 00:30:07.700
 I know.

00:30:07.700 --> 00:30:08.700
 That's...

00:30:08.700 --> 00:30:09.700
 Yeah.

00:30:09.700 --> 00:30:10.700
 I'm just saying it's a lot.

00:30:10.700 --> 00:30:11.700
 It's a lot.

00:30:11.700 --> 00:30:15.780
 But I guess there are billions of people who haven't seen it, so someone's watched at least

00:30:15.780 --> 00:30:16.780
 three times.

00:30:16.780 --> 00:30:17.780
 Yeah.

00:30:17.780 --> 00:30:20.020
 I've watched it two million times.

00:30:20.020 --> 00:30:23.140
 I think there are just a billion people in Asia.

00:30:23.140 --> 00:30:25.140
 A billion people in China, aren't there?

00:30:25.140 --> 00:30:26.140
 Yeah, one point three.

00:30:26.140 --> 00:30:27.140
 Yeah.

00:30:27.140 --> 00:30:28.140
 And more outside that.

00:30:28.140 --> 00:30:29.140
 But still within Asia.

00:30:29.140 --> 00:30:30.140
 Yeah.

00:30:30.140 --> 00:30:32.140
 Asia's population is very high.

00:30:32.140 --> 00:30:33.140
 I know.

00:30:33.140 --> 00:30:38.180
 I shouldn't have been surprised that 15 billion is a lot.

00:30:38.180 --> 00:30:39.180
 I mean, how many people live in Asia?

00:30:39.180 --> 00:30:40.180
 Is it about four billion?

00:30:40.180 --> 00:30:41.180
 It's a very large population.

00:30:41.180 --> 00:30:42.180
 All of Asia.

00:30:42.180 --> 00:30:43.180
 They include in India.

00:30:43.180 --> 00:30:44.180
 Oh, no.

00:30:44.180 --> 00:30:45.180
 Cheating.

00:30:45.180 --> 00:30:46.180
 Oh, I'm including India.

00:30:46.180 --> 00:30:47.180
 Oh, right.

00:30:47.180 --> 00:30:48.180
 Then five.

00:30:48.180 --> 00:30:49.180
 Yeah.

00:30:49.180 --> 00:30:53.380
 One point three billion in China, one point three billion in India, probably about one hundred

00:30:53.380 --> 00:30:55.180
 million in Bangladesh or something.

00:30:55.180 --> 00:30:56.180
 Right.

00:30:56.180 --> 00:30:57.180
 Indonesia.

00:30:57.180 --> 00:30:58.180
 It's not a biggie.

00:30:58.180 --> 00:30:59.180
 But they've still all seen it more than twice.

00:30:59.180 --> 00:31:00.180
 That's the amazing thing.

00:31:00.180 --> 00:31:01.180
 Even all of these people, you know.

00:31:01.180 --> 00:31:03.180
 How do they get anything done?

00:31:03.180 --> 00:31:04.180
 Well, there's China so productive.

00:31:04.180 --> 00:31:07.180
 They're all constantly watching this thing.

00:31:07.180 --> 00:31:11.180
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:31:11.180 --> 00:31:12.180
 OK.

00:31:12.180 --> 00:31:14.180
 It's time for our final fact of the show.

00:31:14.180 --> 00:31:15.180
 And that is my fact.

00:31:15.180 --> 00:31:21.940
 My fact this week is that some meteors skim off the earth as if they were a stone skimming

00:31:21.940 --> 00:31:23.940
 across the waters.

00:31:23.940 --> 00:31:24.940
 That's very good.

00:31:24.940 --> 00:31:25.940
 But who is throwing them?

00:31:25.940 --> 00:31:26.940
 Yes, good question.

00:31:26.940 --> 00:31:27.940
 It's so profound.

00:31:27.940 --> 00:31:28.940
 I know.

00:31:28.940 --> 00:31:29.940
 I've made that a bit more poetic.

00:31:29.940 --> 00:31:33.220
 Probably scientists listening are thinking, you dick, that's not what they do.

00:31:33.220 --> 00:31:37.140
 So, but they don't skim off the earth if you count the earth as the ground that we walk

00:31:37.140 --> 00:31:38.140
 on, do they?

00:31:38.140 --> 00:31:39.140
 No.

00:31:39.140 --> 00:31:40.140
 Exactly.

00:31:40.140 --> 00:31:41.140
 That would be the best fact we've ever done.

00:31:41.140 --> 00:31:42.140
 [LAUGHTER]

00:31:42.140 --> 00:31:43.140
 If no one knew that.

00:31:43.140 --> 00:31:44.140
 What this is, is--

00:31:44.140 --> 00:31:46.140
 [LAUGHTER]

00:31:46.140 --> 00:31:47.140
 This is meteors.

00:31:47.140 --> 00:31:50.080
 Too much of it if the betrayal that came to kill the dinosaurs just went, "Why are you

00:31:50.080 --> 00:31:51.080
 on your own?"

00:31:51.080 --> 00:31:52.080
 [LAUGHTER]

00:31:52.080 --> 00:31:53.080
 Straight back into space.

00:31:53.080 --> 00:31:55.080
 That would be extraordinary.

00:31:55.080 --> 00:31:59.520
 What this is is, we obviously-- we have an atmosphere and the atmosphere is what

00:31:59.520 --> 00:32:00.520
 burns up.

00:32:00.520 --> 00:32:04.280
 When we call a meteorite, it's because it goes through a layer of the atmosphere.

00:32:04.280 --> 00:32:07.920
 It's very cold, burns it up, and then that lands on the earth.

00:32:07.920 --> 00:32:12.120
 Sometimes, when a meteor comes into the earth's atmosphere, it's on such an angle, almost

00:32:12.120 --> 00:32:16.840
 a parallel angle to the earth's atmosphere, that it just bounces off.

00:32:16.840 --> 00:32:18.080
 They're called earth grazers.

00:32:18.080 --> 00:32:19.960
 They don't make it down further.

00:32:19.960 --> 00:32:24.440
 They literally get a lift, a boost off the atmosphere, pushing it back up.

00:32:24.440 --> 00:32:28.080
 Sometimes slowing at speed, but it makes it back out and just hurdles back into space.

00:32:28.080 --> 00:32:31.880
 Latch it if you could skim it off the earth and then off Mars and then off the earth.

00:32:31.880 --> 00:32:32.880
 [LAUGHTER]

00:32:32.880 --> 00:32:35.120
 Wouldn't that be extraordinary?

00:32:35.120 --> 00:32:38.720
 We know that it happens a lot, and a lot of people have seen it with the naked eye, but

00:32:38.720 --> 00:32:41.320
 we haven't actually recorded too many of these.

00:32:41.320 --> 00:32:46.200
 I believe in 2006 was only the fourth time that we've ever caught in camera, what is known

00:32:46.200 --> 00:32:49.000
 as the earth grazers, the ones that come in and skim off.

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:51.680
 So what does it look when you sit with the naked eye?

00:32:51.680 --> 00:32:54.160
 Does it look like a meteor, but it just does burn up?

00:32:54.160 --> 00:32:59.560
 No, it does burn up, so you see the flaming meteorites as it were coming in, but because

00:32:59.560 --> 00:33:02.600
 of the angle, it suddenly just takes a turn and heads off.

00:33:02.600 --> 00:33:04.640
 But do you see it take a turn then with the naked eye?

00:33:04.640 --> 00:33:08.000
 Well, I guess what you see is the flame go out.

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:12.600
 You just see, yeah, you see it's drinking across the sky and then kind of finishing.

00:33:12.600 --> 00:33:17.360
 Is it right to say then that it comes in and it goes very slightly into the earth's atmosphere

00:33:17.360 --> 00:33:20.960
 and then bounces out again, so when it's in the earth's atmosphere, that's when it's

00:33:20.960 --> 00:33:23.440
 burning up and that's what you see, but then it disappears.

00:33:23.440 --> 00:33:24.440
 Exactly.

00:33:24.440 --> 00:33:29.640
 So in 2006, there was one, it was just, it was a bright fireball is what you would have seen

00:33:29.640 --> 00:33:36.680
 in the sky and this was seen over Japan and it made it to 55 miles from the earth's surface.

00:33:36.680 --> 00:33:37.680
 Wow.

00:33:37.680 --> 00:33:38.680
 So that gets really close.

00:33:38.680 --> 00:33:40.920
 And then it just looked down and thought no.

00:33:40.920 --> 00:33:41.920
 Right, man.

00:33:41.920 --> 00:33:42.920
 These guys look lame.

00:33:42.920 --> 00:33:48.680
 Yeah, so it was, it was there for 35 seconds that you could see it and yeah, so and then

00:33:48.680 --> 00:33:53.420
 it just disappears back out into, back into space and in the distance, it's crazy.

00:33:53.420 --> 00:33:58.260
 This is actually related to that or not about meteors, but with spaceships, that same effect

00:33:58.260 --> 00:34:02.140
 is a major concern they have when bringing spaceships back to earth.

00:34:02.140 --> 00:34:05.860
 So one of the hardest things if you're controlling a spaceship is re-entering because you have

00:34:05.860 --> 00:34:09.680
 to get the angle at which you re-enter completely spot on.

00:34:09.680 --> 00:34:14.220
 And if you go to sharpen angle, then you're going to fast and there's too much friction

00:34:14.220 --> 00:34:18.320
 and then you burn up, but if you're going to shallow an angle, if it is really shallow,

00:34:18.320 --> 00:34:22.700
 then again, there's this risk because the earth is a sphere that you'll sort of skim

00:34:22.700 --> 00:34:25.380
 across the atmosphere, but then come back off of it.

00:34:25.380 --> 00:34:26.380
 And miss it.

00:34:26.380 --> 00:34:27.380
 Yeah, miss the earth.

00:34:27.380 --> 00:34:30.320
 You'd have thought it was a big enough target.

00:34:30.320 --> 00:34:34.460
 So one of the biggest problems with Apollo 13 as they came around from the other side of

00:34:34.460 --> 00:34:39.060
 the moon was on top of everything else is that because their instruments were down, that

00:34:39.060 --> 00:34:40.500
 exact thing was going to happen to them.

00:34:40.500 --> 00:34:43.420
 They were not on the right trajectory to come back into earth.

00:34:43.420 --> 00:34:48.420
 So they had to make a thrust, basically with the naked eye, with the earth in the distance

00:34:48.420 --> 00:34:54.360
 using that as a target to get themself back into the right position, otherwise that might

00:34:54.360 --> 00:34:55.360
 have happened to them.

00:34:55.360 --> 00:35:00.300
 Although, I've read a few things, and maybe James, you know about this, about things wouldn't

00:35:00.300 --> 00:35:01.780
 really bounce off the earth.

00:35:01.780 --> 00:35:03.420
 You don't just bounce off into the distance.

00:35:03.420 --> 00:35:04.420
 No, of course not.

00:35:04.420 --> 00:35:09.780
 So there's no spring that you can hit, there's no solidity in the earth, but it's just the

00:35:09.780 --> 00:35:11.500
 fact that the earth is circular.

00:35:11.500 --> 00:35:13.940
 So the earth was flat, which some people argue.

00:35:13.940 --> 00:35:24.300
 Here we go.

00:35:24.300 --> 00:35:28.300
 It's just that it can't get through those dense layers, so it effectively goes straight.

00:35:28.300 --> 00:35:31.540
 But because the earth is a curve, then it comes straight off it again.

00:35:31.540 --> 00:35:35.500
 There's another kind of quite cool earth grazing thing that you can watch.

00:35:35.500 --> 00:35:37.660
 A few people have been lucky to see it.

00:35:37.660 --> 00:35:39.540
 It's called a meteor procession.

00:35:39.540 --> 00:35:40.540
 This is really cool.

00:35:40.540 --> 00:35:45.100
 When it does come into that zone of the atmosphere, where it starts heating up, often a meteor will

00:35:45.100 --> 00:35:46.820
 break into little bits.

00:35:46.820 --> 00:35:50.060
 And that's sometimes when we see meteor showers and so on.

00:35:50.060 --> 00:35:51.060
 It's why you see so many.

00:35:51.060 --> 00:35:55.460
 So what will happen is this meteor will come in, it'll start breaking up into bits, but still

00:35:55.460 --> 00:35:59.860
 enough of it is there to head back out into space and not come down.

00:35:59.860 --> 00:36:04.140
 However, it will now be about 10 of them that will fly back off into space.

00:36:04.140 --> 00:36:07.620
 So you'll just see what looks like because they're all on the same trajectory, just like

00:36:07.620 --> 00:36:11.860
 an Arab show, a procession going over you, flying over it by flaming balls.

00:36:11.860 --> 00:36:12.860
 Yeah.

00:36:12.860 --> 00:36:15.460
 It's kind of like a meteor shower in a way, which is always fun.

00:36:15.460 --> 00:36:18.860
 And I didn't realise that I think this is going to be one of those things that I, it's

00:36:18.860 --> 00:36:19.860
 unbelievable.

00:36:19.860 --> 00:36:20.860
 I didn't know.

00:36:20.860 --> 00:36:24.620
 But I didn't know that meteor showers happened, so regularly, like at the same time, every

00:36:24.620 --> 00:36:28.460
 single year, and that they're all named after the constellation they come from, which is

00:36:28.460 --> 00:36:29.460
 nice.

00:36:29.460 --> 00:36:31.620
 So you've got Orionids or Geminiids.

00:36:31.620 --> 00:36:36.380
 And they're at 112 meteor showers every year, always happen at the same time, because

00:36:36.380 --> 00:36:38.980
 it's where the earth just intersects with the comet tail at the same time.

00:36:38.980 --> 00:36:43.780
 And I guess over many thousands of years, then it changes, as the comet moves away.

00:36:43.780 --> 00:36:44.780
 Yeah.

00:36:44.780 --> 00:36:45.780
 I didn't really know that.

00:36:45.780 --> 00:36:48.300
 How do you say, is it the perseid, or the perseid?

00:36:48.300 --> 00:36:52.460
 So the perseid meteor shower that people might have seen, that is cool.

00:36:52.460 --> 00:36:54.620
 I just quite like this origin of what it's called.

00:36:54.620 --> 00:36:57.700
 It's usually referred to as the tears of St. Lawrence.

00:36:57.700 --> 00:37:02.780
 And that is after St. Lawrence, who is that Christian Deacon, who the Romans burnt him

00:37:02.780 --> 00:37:09.300
 in AD258, and he's the one who, you know, they put him on a barbecue, roasted on a barbecue.

00:37:09.300 --> 00:37:13.540
 And then he, apparently, according to legend, was the guy that said, "I am already roasted

00:37:13.540 --> 00:37:14.540
 on one side.

00:37:14.540 --> 00:37:18.540
 If you would have me well cooked, it is time to turn me on to the other."

00:37:18.540 --> 00:37:19.540
 It's such a great story.

00:37:19.540 --> 00:37:20.540
 It's so lovely.

00:37:20.540 --> 00:37:21.540
 It's so lovely.

00:37:21.540 --> 00:37:24.260
 So what you actually said, was that?

00:37:24.260 --> 00:37:26.780
 Well, that was that in Latin.

00:37:26.780 --> 00:37:30.260
 I've got a religious connection to all this, too.

00:37:30.260 --> 00:37:32.220
 So there is an argument.

00:37:32.220 --> 00:37:35.140
 It's only an argument, and we'll never know the truth, but there's an argument that.

00:37:35.140 --> 00:37:38.100
 There's a bit in the Bible where St. Paul has a conversion.

00:37:38.100 --> 00:37:39.900
 He's on the road to Damascus.

00:37:39.900 --> 00:37:41.860
 He's called something else before that, and then he becomes Paul.

00:37:41.860 --> 00:37:42.860
 It's called Saul.

00:37:42.860 --> 00:37:43.860
 He's called Saul.

00:37:43.860 --> 00:37:45.420
 And Saul becomes Paul.

00:37:45.420 --> 00:37:50.060
 So there is an argument that he just saw a meteor, because in the account, there are several

00:37:50.060 --> 00:37:51.060
 different accounts of it.

00:37:51.060 --> 00:37:52.700
 He sees a big flash, I think.

00:37:52.700 --> 00:37:53.700
 Exactly.

00:37:53.700 --> 00:37:54.700
 He says it's brighter than the sun.

00:37:54.700 --> 00:37:56.220
 It can be brighter than the sun.

00:37:56.220 --> 00:37:57.220
 He fell over.

00:37:57.220 --> 00:37:58.220
 Take.

00:37:58.220 --> 00:37:59.220
 That would happen.

00:37:59.220 --> 00:38:00.220
 Why?

00:38:00.220 --> 00:38:01.980
 It's a shockwave if a meteor arrives.

00:38:01.980 --> 00:38:02.980
 Oh.

00:38:02.980 --> 00:38:03.980
 Take.

00:38:03.980 --> 00:38:04.980
 Really?

00:38:04.980 --> 00:38:05.980
 He also says he heard a big noise.

00:38:05.980 --> 00:38:06.980
 Take.

00:38:06.980 --> 00:38:08.980
 And he was blinded, which could happen.

00:38:08.980 --> 00:38:09.980
 Well, but do you know that?

00:38:09.980 --> 00:38:11.980
 That also could be a truck.

00:38:11.980 --> 00:38:12.980
 Couldn't it?

00:38:12.980 --> 00:38:13.980
 No, I don't think it lights.

00:38:13.980 --> 00:38:14.980
 I don't think it lights.

00:38:14.980 --> 00:38:15.980
 Yeah.

00:38:15.980 --> 00:38:16.980
 Paul's over.

00:38:16.980 --> 00:38:17.980
 Take.

00:38:17.980 --> 00:38:18.980
 Loud noise.

00:38:18.980 --> 00:38:19.980
 Take.

00:38:19.980 --> 00:38:20.980
 That's true.

00:38:20.980 --> 00:38:22.980
 And it would have been more miraculous in a way to produce a truck at that time.

00:38:22.980 --> 00:38:27.820
 Hey, just speaking of that idea you said of, it's not as crazy as a meteorite hitting the

00:38:27.820 --> 00:38:30.300
 Earth's surface itself and bouncing off.

00:38:30.300 --> 00:38:31.300
 Oh, yeah.

00:38:31.300 --> 00:38:40.740
 There is a Mars, 2.5 million years ago, a rock left the surface of Mars, shot out into space,

00:38:40.740 --> 00:38:48.740
 then in 1962, that rock finally landed on Earth as a meteorite in Nigeria, in Zagami.

00:38:48.740 --> 00:38:51.860
 And it's known as the Zagami meteorite.

00:38:51.860 --> 00:38:56.740
 And sometimes soon in the future, that very same bit of meteorite is going to become a meteorite

00:38:56.740 --> 00:38:59.820
 again, except this time, back on Mars.

00:38:59.820 --> 00:39:04.740
 Because in 1996, we put some of that meteorite back onto a ship.

00:39:04.740 --> 00:39:07.260
 So we've relaunched it out of our planet.

00:39:07.260 --> 00:39:11.220
 And it's part of the Mars Global Survey, which has been going around Mars, but we've lost

00:39:11.220 --> 00:39:12.380
 contact with.

00:39:12.380 --> 00:39:16.620
 So very soon that satellite is going to go into, it's going to be sucked in by the orbit

00:39:16.620 --> 00:39:17.620
 of Mars.

00:39:17.620 --> 00:39:18.620
 It's going to be so pissed off.

00:39:18.620 --> 00:39:22.540
 In that, if you're like, I've traveled for 2.5 million years to get away from that place

00:39:22.540 --> 00:39:24.500
 and you've literally just put me straight back.

00:39:24.500 --> 00:39:25.500
 That's true.

00:39:25.500 --> 00:39:26.500
 That's incredible, though.

00:39:26.500 --> 00:39:30.820
 It's like a cool poetic justice, isn't it?

00:39:30.820 --> 00:39:34.700
 I think it's amazing how these rocks get from one place to another.

00:39:34.700 --> 00:39:41.780
 Like for instance, when the dinosaur asteroid came down, it breaks through the atmosphere,

00:39:41.780 --> 00:39:44.860
 basically pushes all the atmosphere out of the way, causes a vacuum.

00:39:44.860 --> 00:39:48.620
 And so when it hits the ground, the loads of rocks come up, they all get sucked into space.

00:39:48.620 --> 00:39:49.620
 Oh wow.

00:39:49.620 --> 00:39:54.540
 And so you could theoretically have some rocks from the dinosaur age that have since made

00:39:54.540 --> 00:39:59.020
 it onto the moon, and they could theoretically be dinosaur fossils, obviously.

00:39:59.020 --> 00:40:02.460
 In fit, like probably not, but theoretically it could be.

00:40:02.460 --> 00:40:08.060
 There was an article about this recently, there's a piece of rock that they think maybe

00:40:08.060 --> 00:40:10.460
 it's from Earth, but they can't, they need to do more tests.

00:40:10.460 --> 00:40:14.820
 In fact, that one you are talking about, I think they do, like you say, they're not sharp,

00:40:14.820 --> 00:40:18.700
 but they're pretty sure it is from the Earth, because it was the way you can tell it how

00:40:18.700 --> 00:40:22.100
 it was formed, and it was formed in a way that either it's from the Earth or they have

00:40:22.100 --> 00:40:25.100
 to change the way that the history of the moon is.

00:40:25.100 --> 00:40:28.580
 Right, because they think it couldn't have come up to the surface of the moon in the right

00:40:28.580 --> 00:40:29.580
 times.

00:40:29.580 --> 00:40:34.100
 It's a bit complicated, but yeah, that could be the oldest known Earth rock, and they found

00:40:34.100 --> 00:40:35.100
 it on the moon.

00:40:35.100 --> 00:40:41.860
 It's about 4 billion years old, it's incredible, is it because they brought it back to it?

00:40:41.860 --> 00:40:42.860
 They must have done that.

00:40:42.860 --> 00:40:44.180
 Yeah, it came on Apollo 14, I think.

00:40:44.180 --> 00:40:46.180
 What are the odds of bringing back?

00:40:46.180 --> 00:40:48.380
 Did you come back with some moon samples?

00:40:48.380 --> 00:40:49.380
 We've got some bad news.

00:40:49.380 --> 00:40:50.380
 We feel so stupid.

00:40:50.380 --> 00:40:55.020
 Probably that spaceship crossed with the Martian one and the two rocks waved at each other

00:40:55.020 --> 00:40:56.860
 going, "Go back home, yeah, go back home."

00:40:56.860 --> 00:41:00.860
 Why have we got such strict immigration laws in the universe when we keep on sending

00:41:00.860 --> 00:41:02.860
 fun rocks back when they came through?

00:41:02.860 --> 00:41:07.300
 No wonder conspiracy theorists don't think we went, the only rocks we've got are fucking

00:41:07.300 --> 00:41:10.300
 from here anyway.

00:41:10.300 --> 00:41:12.500
 Can I just say one thing about just about the Tunguska?

00:41:12.500 --> 00:41:17.260
 So the Tunguska event was this massive explosion, we'll see in 1908, it was so big, it

00:41:17.260 --> 00:41:22.820
 cast light over the whole world and at the time the night, the night skies glowed so brightly

00:41:22.820 --> 00:41:29.460
 that people in Asia, which we know is heavily populated, so probably quite a lot of people,

00:41:29.460 --> 00:41:34.700
 people in Asia read their newspapers outdoors at midnight and apparently at least one golfer

00:41:34.700 --> 00:41:39.380
 got in a round at 2.30 in the morning in St Andrews and Scotland.

00:41:39.380 --> 00:41:40.380
 That's amazing.

00:41:40.380 --> 00:41:41.380
 That's you.

00:41:41.380 --> 00:41:42.380
 That's the 1908 version of you, James.

00:41:42.380 --> 00:41:48.580
 Does it look like the world's ending here, wow, I think I could get diving in there.

00:41:48.580 --> 00:41:54.660
 So a meteor, heading towards the earth, if it's a small-ish size, we would call that, let's

00:41:54.660 --> 00:41:58.820
 say a meteor, a meteoroid meteorite in the earth, if it was bigger, it's an asteroid, right?

00:41:58.820 --> 00:42:00.620
 So it's a sightseeing.

00:42:00.620 --> 00:42:05.460
 So in movies, whenever we try to prevent an asteroid from hitting the earth, they always

00:42:05.460 --> 00:42:10.740
 send up some kind of big nuclear device to blow it up and there's so many plans going

00:42:10.740 --> 00:42:15.780
 on with NASA and independent bodies of scientists who are trying to work out the best way to stop

00:42:15.780 --> 00:42:18.220
 potential asteroids from hitting the earth.

00:42:18.220 --> 00:42:22.100
 And there's something that want to wrap it in a sail and sort of sail it in a different

00:42:22.100 --> 00:42:23.100
 direction.

00:42:23.100 --> 00:42:27.380
 But one thing I read is they don't ever really want to go for the nuclear option because

00:42:27.380 --> 00:42:31.300
 obviously you blow it up and then suddenly you're sending a lot of rocks to earth.

00:42:31.300 --> 00:42:36.580
 But what I didn't realize is they're nuclear rocks now, so you've made them radioactive.

00:42:36.580 --> 00:42:42.060
 So you would actually just make the whole situation doubly worse by spreading radiation everywhere

00:42:42.060 --> 00:42:43.060
 where it hit.

00:42:43.060 --> 00:42:46.580
 I mean, we have this ridiculous policy where we can't bring a strand of hair into space

00:42:46.580 --> 00:42:51.500
 in case it infects Mars and I can't believe that I'm considering sending radioactive rocks

00:42:51.500 --> 00:42:52.500
 out into space.

00:42:52.500 --> 00:42:53.500
 Yeah.

00:42:53.500 --> 00:42:54.980
 I think the key would be to push it, wouldn't it?

00:42:54.980 --> 00:42:58.700
 That's the current best theory because there's a guy at NASA who's called the planetary

00:42:58.700 --> 00:43:00.020
 protection officer.

00:43:00.020 --> 00:43:04.940
 He's an awesome guy, but he's very low-key about the whole thing, so his name is Lindley

00:43:04.940 --> 00:43:09.140
 Johnson, and he's responsible for it basically, but he's only got eight members of staff.

00:43:09.140 --> 00:43:12.100
 So if we get hit by an asteroid, is it his fault?

00:43:12.100 --> 00:43:13.100
 Effectively.

00:43:13.100 --> 00:43:17.740
 But he was asked about it, he said, "Do you feel a little pressure being the planetary protection

00:43:17.740 --> 00:43:18.740
 officer?"

00:43:18.740 --> 00:43:20.780
 And he said, "It doesn't stress me out that much."

00:43:20.780 --> 00:43:27.140
 Well, I want someone to be a bit more, but actually, because who does he answer to if we

00:43:27.140 --> 00:43:29.940
 do get all annihilated by an asteroid?

00:43:29.940 --> 00:43:36.940
 Well, he's going to go into the cockroach's office and cockroach will say, "Well done."

00:43:36.940 --> 00:43:44.500
 You've been working for us all this time.

00:43:44.500 --> 00:43:45.500
 Okay, that is it.

00:43:45.500 --> 00:43:46.500
 That is all of our facts.

00:43:46.500 --> 00:43:47.980
 Thank you so much for listening.

00:43:47.980 --> 00:43:51.220

 We also have links to our tour.

00:44:10.780 --> 00:44:13.060
 We're going to be touring all around the UK in March.

00:44:13.060 --> 00:44:14.740
 We're going to Ireland as well.

00:44:14.740 --> 00:44:15.900
 Please get some tickets.
