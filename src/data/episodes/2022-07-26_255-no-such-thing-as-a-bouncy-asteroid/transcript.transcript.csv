00:00:00,00:00:20,"""Hello and welcome to another episode of no such thing as a fish, a weekly podcast"
00:00:20,00:00:23,coming to you from the QI offices in Covenant Garden.
00:00:23,00:00:28,"My name is Dan Schreiber, I'm sitting here with James Harkin, Andrew Hunter Murray, and"
00:00:28,00:00:33,"Aniches Insky, and once again we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite"
00:00:33,00:00:39,"facts from the last seven days, and in no particular order, here we go, starting with you, Andy."""
00:00:39,00:00:44,"My Vectors that when Britain declared war in 1914, they accidentally did it in the wrong"
00:00:44,00:00:49,"format and they had to swap the letters, otherwise Britain would not technically be at war."
00:00:49,00:00:51,"""Well, what kind of farm that was?"
00:00:51,00:00:56,"I don't know, I don't know if it was in landscape or in some kind of... what they declared"
00:00:56,00:01:01,"with a painter or in a m... or emojis or so, I don't know, I have no idea."
00:01:01,00:01:05,"But this is from an article in Times Literary Supplement, which is great by the way, highly"
00:01:05,00:01:09,"recommended, and there was a British diplomat called Harold Nicholson who was working at"
00:01:09,00:01:14,"the foreign office, and one day he was told, ""We've declared war on Germany, but we screwed"
00:01:14,00:01:18,"it up,"" and we sent the letter which doesn't quite say the right phrase, I think."
00:01:18,00:01:24,"I think what it was was, they thought that Germany had declared war because they intercepted"
00:01:24,00:01:29,"some thing over their radio waves, but actually Germany hadn't declared war, and so the letter"
00:01:29,00:01:33,"said, ""We accept your declaration of war, but what they actually wanted to say was, we declare"
00:01:33,00:01:34,"war on you."""
00:01:34,00:01:39,"Ah, because Britain was obliged to go to the defence of Belgium and Germany have violated"
00:01:39,00:01:45,"a Belgian territory, and so, yeah, so... that's a sort of, you can't fire me, I quit, situation"
00:01:45,00:01:46,isn't it?
00:01:46,00:01:47,It's very much like that.
00:01:47,00:01:52,"Yeah, it's like getting a text message saying, ""I'm having an affair too,"" and then you"
00:01:52,00:01:54,have to withdraw that.
00:01:54,00:01:55,And just say.
00:01:55,00:01:56,"And just say, ""I'm having an affair."""
00:01:56,00:01:58,"It's like getting the text message saying, ""I'm having an affair,"" and then your spouse"
00:01:58,00:01:59,"says, ""I wasn't having an affair."
00:01:59,00:02:00,"What are you talking about?"""
00:02:00,00:02:05,"Guys, I really think you should do these kind of things face to face."
00:02:05,00:02:10,"But Nicholson had to go to the German embassy at night, and he went so late in the day that"
00:02:10,00:02:15,"the German ambassador, who was Prince Lichnovsky, he was in his pajamas in his bedroom, and he"
00:02:15,00:02:19,"had the letter declaring war on a tray by his bed, and Nicholson had to do the old switch"
00:02:19,00:02:21,to Rue.
00:02:21,00:02:24,"And he says that he didn't notice, the Prince didn't notice."
00:02:24,00:02:27,"He thought it was just a social visit to say, ""Well, sorry, we're a war now."""
00:02:27,00:02:30,"And was this, this was after they'd officially declared war, it was just they were like, ""Oh,"
00:02:30,00:02:31,we've got a bit of the paperwork wrong.
00:02:31,00:02:32,"We've got to swap that."""
00:02:32,00:02:34,"It was that evening, yeah."
00:02:34,00:02:35,"It was that evening, yeah."
00:02:35,00:02:41,"So what had happened was Britain had given an automaton to Germany, saying, ""If you don't"
00:02:41,00:02:44,"get out of Belgium, we're going to declare war,"" and then it got to the evening and they"
00:02:44,00:02:48,"thought Germany had declared war, but they hadn't, and then when it got to midnight,"
00:02:48,00:02:50,that was our automaton had kind of hit then.
00:02:50,00:02:51,It was actually 11pm.
00:02:51,00:02:52,"11pm, sorry."
00:02:52,00:02:53,It's very important.
00:02:53,00:02:54,It is.
00:02:54,00:02:55,Very important.
00:02:55,00:02:59,"You see, if I wasn't charged, we'd never go to war, would we?"
00:02:59,00:03:02,"But poor old Lichnovsky was so upset, wasn't he?"
00:03:02,00:03:06,"So he was the ambassador, and I always think ambassadors must have such a difficult job"
00:03:06,00:03:09,"in war, because they're friends with everyone in the country they're in."
00:03:09,00:03:12,So he was mates with all the Brits.
00:03:12,00:03:17,"He was very good friends with Asquith, and his wife, Margot Asquith, so Margot Asquith's"
00:03:17,00:03:23,"wife, actually went to visit Lichnovsky about an hour or two before war was properly declared"
00:03:23,00:03:25,"and just went to comfort him and say, ""Sorry, this is rough, isn't it?"""
00:03:25,00:03:27,"And he was sobbing, saying, ""It's all over."""
00:03:27,00:03:32,"And he knew Nicholson as well, so yeah, because when Nicholson went to visit him, he was"
00:03:32,00:03:33,in his night clothes.
00:03:33,00:03:36,"The last thing he said to him was, ""Give my best regards to your father."
00:03:36,00:03:39,"I shall not, in all probability, see him before my departure."""
00:03:39,00:03:40,Yeah.
00:03:40,00:03:42,And they hated the Germans.
00:03:42,00:03:43,He's good.
00:03:43,00:03:44,Who did the German ambassador?
00:03:44,00:03:49,"Yeah, so the ambassador's wife said to Margot Asquith on just the second of August, so two days"
00:03:49,00:03:54,"before we went to war, to think that we should bring such sorrows to an innocent and happy"
00:03:54,00:03:55,people.
00:03:55,00:03:59,"I've always hated and loathed our Kaiser, having not said so a thousand times here in his"
00:03:59,00:04:00,friends were all Brits.
00:04:00,00:04:02,So they were not pleased about it.
00:04:02,00:04:06,"No, and I suppose if you are an ambassador, you're going to have a more rounded world view,"
00:04:06,00:04:07,aren't you?
00:04:07,00:04:08,Yeah.
00:04:08,00:04:09,"You know, probably, I don't know."
00:04:09,00:04:10,Yeah.
00:04:10,00:04:11,I've never been one.
00:04:11,00:04:16,"I'm sorry, just on Nicholson, then he later went on, people might have heard of him, because"
00:04:16,00:04:24,"he later went on to marry writer Vita Sackfield West in a kind of marriage of convenience, because"
00:04:24,00:04:28,"I think he was gay and she was a lesbian, or they were maybe both bisexual, but they kind"
00:04:28,00:04:33,of got married so that she could inherit her ancestral home of Sissinghurst.
00:04:33,00:04:36,"I'm sure it wasn't a phrasing mistake, and he didn't mean to say, ""You're not going"
00:04:36,00:04:37,"to like something like that."""
00:04:37,00:04:38,Yeah.
00:04:38,00:04:39,"He accidentally wrote, ""Would you marry me?"""
00:04:39,00:04:40,I'm sorry.
00:04:40,00:04:41,"I meant to say, ""I don't."""
00:04:41,00:04:46,"I've not heard of her, is she a big author?"
00:04:46,00:04:50,"She's a poet, and she's quite famous."
00:04:50,00:04:51,Cool.
00:04:51,00:04:54,"I obviously know her, because she has a weird name, right?"
00:04:54,00:04:55,Yeah.
00:04:55,00:04:56,"It kind of sticks in your head, doesn't it?"
00:04:56,00:04:57,Yeah.
00:04:57,00:05:00,"So George the Fifth also, sort of, lots of people declare war."
00:05:00,00:05:04,"Officially, George the Fifth is one of the people who sort of announced the nation that we"
00:05:04,00:05:07,"were at war, and his diary is very interesting, because it's so matter of fact."
00:05:07,00:05:13,"So his diary on that night, he wrote it just before he went to sleep, and it was a short"
00:05:13,00:05:14,entry.
00:05:14,00:05:17,"He said, ""I held a council at 10.45 in the evening to declare war with Germany."
00:05:17,00:05:21,"It is a terrible catastrophe, but it is not our fault."""
00:05:21,00:05:24,"And then he said, ""The crowds were all cheering."""
00:05:24,00:05:27,"When they heard war had been declared, the cheering was even more terrific, went to Bennett"
00:05:27,00:05:28,Midnight.
00:05:28,00:05:31,"And that's just, that's the start of the first world war for you."
00:05:31,00:05:32,"Oh, yeah."
00:05:32,00:05:35,"There were loads of, because they had a speech in Parliament, didn't they?"
00:05:35,00:05:38,Was it grey or someone did a speech in Parliament?
00:05:38,00:05:42,And everyone was outside kind of expecting that war was going to be declared.
00:05:42,00:05:47,"And there was a mob in London who attacked the German Embassy, and at the same time there"
00:05:47,00:05:52,"was a mob in Germany that attacked the British Embassy in Berlin, throwing stones."
00:05:52,00:05:54,That is kind of a microcosm of the next four years.
00:05:54,00:05:55,Yes.
00:05:55,00:05:59,"There's someone else who we know where they were when war broke out, and it's Adolf Hitler."
00:05:59,00:06:03,"And the interesting thing is we know, because there was a photograph taken of this huge crowd"
00:06:03,00:06:08,"in Munich at a place called the Odian Plats, and they're all celebrating."
00:06:08,00:06:11,"There's lots of people, lots of crowds all over Europe celebrated the outbreak of war."
00:06:11,00:06:12,They thought it was a good thing.
00:06:12,00:06:18,"And you can see, if you zoom in, Hitler in the crowd with a really big droopy moustache."
00:06:18,00:06:19,Really?
00:06:19,00:06:20,Yeah.
00:06:20,00:06:21,But this is the crazy thing.
00:06:21,00:06:26,"So the photo was taken by a photographer who later became Hitler's official photographer,"
00:06:26,00:06:31,"and in one of the very early bits of Nazi propaganda, Hitler, they tracked down this"
00:06:31,00:06:35,"photo, they saw you saw Hitler in the crowd, and they retouched his moustache to turn it into"
00:06:35,00:06:38,"the toothbrush moustache, that Hitler later adopted."
00:06:38,00:06:43,"Oh, if only we all had photographers to retouch photos from our youth."
00:06:43,00:06:47,Our parents would be so thrilled to do it.
00:06:47,00:06:52,"Well, apart from he kind of retouches them all to make it look like he did when he was older."
00:06:52,00:06:53,It's true.
00:06:53,00:06:55,It's like giving yourself a mullet in a photo from the 80s.
00:06:55,00:06:56,It's really weird.
00:06:56,00:06:57,Yeah.
00:06:57,00:07:00,"But you're always ashamed of how you dress when you're younger, whether it's a weird"
00:07:00,00:07:03,"bit of moustache, or you've got your stupid long hair from the 70s."
00:07:03,00:07:04,Sorry.
00:07:04,00:07:05,"It's not like giving yourself a mullet, isn't it?"
00:07:05,00:07:06,"No, it's the opposite."
00:07:06,00:07:07,"No, it's the opposite."
00:07:07,00:07:08,It's the opposite.
00:07:08,00:07:09,"Yeah, it's taking away the mullet."
00:07:09,00:07:10,Yes.
00:07:10,00:07:11,The mullet's embarrassing.
00:07:11,00:07:12,It's like moustache.
00:07:12,00:07:18,It's like the Pope going back to his baby photos and putting a big hat on the mullet.
00:07:18,00:07:20,It's exactly what it's like.
00:07:20,00:07:24,Did you read one of the other amazing pieces of protocol they had to go through that
00:07:24,00:07:30,"day when Britain declared war, was that the foreign office sent out loads of telegrams"
00:07:30,00:07:33,to all the continents around the world that were vaguely affiliated with warning them were
00:07:33,00:07:34,about to go to war.
00:07:34,00:07:38,"So this is sort of in the afternoon going on early evening, all these telegrams were sent"
00:07:38,00:07:43,"out, and the foreign office clerks had to send them out, and all they had to do was fill"
00:07:43,00:07:47,"it in a pre-written telegram that said just to warn you, Britain is going to war with"
00:07:47,00:07:48,blank.
00:07:48,00:07:52,"And they just wrote the word Germany, because they'd had them pre-written for about ten"
00:07:52,00:07:53,years.
00:07:53,00:07:54,"No, good."
00:07:54,00:07:56,They just knew that they were going to go to war eventually.
00:07:56,00:08:01,"It's like, you know, when you are a kid and you have birthday invites, and it says you"
00:08:01,00:08:05,"are invited to Blacks Party, like it's exactly like that, is it?"
00:08:05,00:08:06,It is.
00:08:06,00:08:09,Do you think some were accidentally they forgot to fill them in and consciously just left
00:08:09,00:08:10,guessing?
00:08:10,00:08:11,Right.
00:08:11,00:08:15,"I would have for a laugh put a different country in just one telegram, just so one British"
00:08:15,00:08:19,territory overseas thinks we're at war with Switzerland or something.
00:08:19,00:08:20,Yes.
00:08:20,00:08:21,Or do you think they sent it to Germany and it just said you?
00:08:21,00:08:22,"Oh, yeah."
00:08:22,00:08:28,"Real privilege, the most senior clerk got to do the you one."
00:08:28,00:08:33,"I was just reading generally about what happened as soon as war was declared, and obviously"
00:08:33,00:08:38,"a lot of soldiers had to be conscripted, and that led me into just looking into conscription."
00:08:38,00:08:40,"And I read about this thing, which I'd not heard of, I don't know if you guys have, but"
00:08:40,00:08:41,the pals of Italian.
00:08:41,00:08:44,Have you heard of that?
00:08:44,00:08:48,"This was, so obviously they had to work out what was the best way to get people sort"
00:08:48,00:08:50,of passionate about joining the war.
00:08:50,00:08:56,"And one of the ideas was the idea that if you signed up with a friend of yours, there"
00:08:56,00:08:59,was a promise that you would both be in the same battalion.
00:08:59,00:09:02,So professional golfers were known to sign up with each other.
00:09:02,00:09:07,"There was the Grimsby Chums, and that was former schoolboys from wintering him secondary"
00:09:07,00:09:08,school and Grimsby Grimsby.
00:09:08,00:09:11,"A terrible idea, actually, because if you're going to go to war and have to see all these"
00:09:11,00:09:14,"people around you dropping dead, I'd rather they weren't all my mates."
00:09:14,00:09:15,I know.
00:09:15,00:09:16,I guess it's a morale thing though up until that point.
00:09:16,00:09:20,"Well, the idea is that you might fight harder if it's to save your friends, I think."
00:09:20,00:09:21,"Yes, yes."
00:09:21,00:09:28,"There was, in Thieves, they had a secret band of an army where they were all lovers, all"
00:09:28,00:09:29,gay lovers.
00:09:29,00:09:31,And so they would all be in this army together and they would all fight.
00:09:31,00:09:32,Where was it?
00:09:32,00:09:34,This is in Thieves in the Spartan.
00:09:34,00:09:35,In the Spartan?
00:09:35,00:09:36,"Wow, really?"
00:09:36,00:09:37,There's not a lot of innovation.
00:09:37,00:09:38,No.
00:09:38,00:09:43,Although actually the war between Sparta and Athens did go on until 1996.
00:09:43,00:09:44,What?
00:09:44,00:09:45,No.
00:09:45,00:09:46,Come on now.
00:09:46,00:09:50,"It was one of those ones, you know, where they don't sign their peace agreement."
00:09:50,00:09:51,Yeah.
00:09:51,00:09:55,"And so in 1986, they signed a symbolic agreement that Sparta and Athens were no longer at"
00:09:55,00:10:00,"war, even though that they'd both been part of modern day Greece for about a thousand years."
00:10:00,00:10:04,So I think we may have briefly mentioned the Barrack upon Tweed thing before.
00:10:04,00:10:06,"So there's this, the town of Barrack on Tweed."
00:10:06,00:10:11,They mistakenly believed that they were at war with Russia for about 150 years after
00:10:11,00:10:13,the end of the Crimean War.
00:10:13,00:10:16,So that ended 1856.
00:10:16,00:10:19,And it's because there was this really complicated history with Barrack upon Tweed.
00:10:19,00:10:22,Because it's right on the border of England and Scotland.
00:10:22,00:10:24,"And it went, it changed hands about 13 times."
00:10:24,00:10:28,"And there was a 1502 agreement between England and Scotland, which said that Barrack upon Tweed"
00:10:28,00:10:32,"is off, but not within the kingdom of England."
00:10:32,00:10:35,"Actually, it had been sorted out in 1746, it was all fine."
00:10:35,00:10:37,"If you didn't mention Barrack upon Tweed, there was no problem."
00:10:37,00:10:39,It was still included.
00:10:39,00:10:40,"But the town, no one really knew that."
00:10:40,00:10:41,It didn't sort of get through.
00:10:41,00:10:45,So people kept naming it in official documents as a kind of just in case.
00:10:45,00:10:47,They couldn't remember whether it was included.
00:10:47,00:10:53,So people thought that they had been left out and that they were still at war with Russia.
00:10:53,00:10:54,And this is the really sweet thing.
00:10:54,00:10:59,"In 2006, there was a kind of exhibition about this in the town, about this interesting,"
00:10:59,00:11:00,"you know, King of History."
00:11:00,00:11:03,And it was Barrack's war with Russia weekend.
00:11:03,00:11:09,"And apparently, as part of it, they had a Wattif reenactment, which I think is the best."
00:11:09,00:11:13,Surely the Wattif in Wattif was Barrack being flattened within 30 seconds.
00:11:13,00:11:17,Russia going about his business.
00:11:17,00:11:20,I was just looking a little bit at the declaration of the Second World War.
00:11:20,00:11:24,And the Second World War was kind of declared by two Nevels.
00:11:24,00:11:25,So it was not really...
00:11:25,00:11:26,"Oh, really?"
00:11:26,00:11:27,Was it?
00:11:27,00:11:30,"It wasn't Gary in film, though."
00:11:30,00:11:32,"It was, obviously, there was Chamberlain."
00:11:32,00:11:34,But then there was also Neville Henderson.
00:11:34,00:11:36,He was the British ambassador in Germany.
00:11:36,00:11:39,So it was his job to go and actually tell the Germans that we were at war.
00:11:39,00:11:43,"But it might have been because of a mistake, again, a little bit like this era."
00:11:43,00:11:44,In 1914.
00:11:44,00:11:47,So it was August the 30th in 1939.
00:11:47,00:11:52,"And Henderson went and met Ribbon Drop, who was their Hitler's prime secretary."
00:11:52,00:11:53,"And apparently, things got really tense."
00:11:53,00:11:56,"You know, Henderson was saying, ""Please stop invading all these countries."
00:11:56,00:11:58,"Please don't do the Poland thing."""
00:11:58,00:12:00,And it came really close to blows.
00:12:00,00:12:02,They almost started punching each other.
00:12:02,00:12:05,"And then Ribbon Drop said, ""Okay, we're going to give you our last offer."
00:12:05,00:12:07,"We're going to give Poland the last offer."""
00:12:07,00:12:12,"And Britain was, obviously, basically represented Poland at this point."
00:12:12,00:12:16,"And so Ribbon Drop read over the last offer, but Henderson's really pissed off with Ribbon Drop"
00:12:16,00:12:17,at this point.
00:12:17,00:12:18,So he didn't really listen.
00:12:18,00:12:21,"And Ribbon Drop read over it really, really fast, sped through it apparently."
00:12:21,00:12:23,"And then Henderson went, ""Okay, fine, give me the copy."""
00:12:23,00:12:26,"And Ribbon Drop said, ""No, not going to give you the copy."
00:12:26,00:12:28,"Hope you were paying attention."""
00:12:28,00:12:31,"And so Henderson didn't know what had just happened, didn't really know what the offer"
00:12:31,00:12:32,was.
00:12:32,00:12:33,It was kind of deliberately convoluted.
00:12:33,00:12:37,"And then Ribbon Drop said, ""You've got to respond by midnight."""
00:12:37,00:12:38,And this confused everything.
00:12:38,00:12:40,"And within a couple of days, there was war."
00:12:40,00:12:41,Wow.
00:12:41,00:12:42,Yeah.
00:12:42,00:12:43,So always pay attention.
00:12:43,00:12:44,Yeah.
00:12:44,00:12:46,I don't think that's a message.
00:12:46,00:12:48,So who was Ribbon Drop?
00:12:48,00:12:54,"I can see you all switch off, then, and we've gone to war."
00:12:54,00:13:03,"Okay, it is time for fact number two, and that is James."
00:13:03,00:13:09,"Okay, my fact this week is that there's a bacterium that can freeze water just by touching"
00:13:09,00:13:10,it.
00:13:10,00:13:14,And these bacteria are used to make artificial snow in ski resorts.
00:13:14,00:13:15,That was crazy.
00:13:15,00:13:16,It's amazing.
00:13:16,00:13:17,It's amazing.
00:13:17,00:13:18,It's not fast.
00:13:18,00:13:23,"If I dropped one of these bacteria into my glass of water, is it frozen straight away?"
00:13:23,00:13:24,No.
00:13:24,00:13:27,So it tends to do it with plants.
00:13:27,00:13:32,It goes into the plant cells and it freezes the water in the plant cells so it can access
00:13:32,00:13:34,the nutrients inside the plants.
00:13:34,00:13:38,"But the way that it does it is it has a protein on the outside of the bacterium, and they"
00:13:38,00:13:44,"can shift the molecules around of the water, and the water then orders it, like, kind of"
00:13:44,00:13:48,"gets into a lattice into a template, which is what ice is, really."
00:13:48,00:13:51,And then it can also remove heat from the water in the same way that a refrigerator removes
00:13:51,00:13:54,heat from the inside of it.
00:13:54,00:13:59,"So it gets hotter, but it removes heat from the water itself to make it into ice."
00:13:59,00:14:01,"And the plants don't like that, presumably."
00:14:01,00:14:04,"The plants do not like being killed, no."
00:14:04,00:14:08,There's actually any frost damage that you see is usually down to this bacteria.
00:14:08,00:14:09,Really?
00:14:09,00:14:10,Yeah.
00:14:10,00:14:15,"So if you have a plant at, say, minus four degrees minus three or four degrees, it should"
00:14:15,00:14:17,be fine because the water inside it can super cool.
00:14:17,00:14:20,It won't turn to ice until a little bit later than that.
00:14:20,00:14:25,"But if it has this bacterium in it, then the bacteria will turn the water, which would have"
00:14:25,00:14:27,been liquid into ice and it can kill the plants.
00:14:27,00:14:28,Bastard.
00:14:28,00:14:29,Bastard.
00:14:29,00:14:30,Bastard.
00:14:30,00:14:32,"What I find is the same, sorry."
00:14:32,00:14:38,What I find amazing is that this is being used in artificial snow making as in you must have
00:14:38,00:14:44,to have so many hundreds and hundreds of millions and billions of these bacteria to make lots
00:14:44,00:14:45,of artificial snow.
00:14:45,00:14:46,How do you breed?
00:14:46,00:14:47,"I guess they just, they just reduced."
00:14:47,00:14:48,They just reduced.
00:14:48,00:14:49,They breed so bacteria.
00:14:49,00:14:52,You just leave one alone for 20 hours and then you go back to the beginning.
00:14:52,00:14:53,"Well, yeah, that's the thing."
00:14:53,00:14:59,I read a single-cell bacteria in a 12-hour period they can produce 70 billion bacteria
00:14:59,00:15:00,from a single-cell bacteria.
00:15:00,00:15:01,It's a good question.
00:15:01,00:15:02,It breaks that process.
00:15:02,00:15:03,It breaks that process.
00:15:03,00:15:04,"So small, isn't it?"
00:15:04,00:15:06,"Because if they were like human size, overcrowding of the world would have happened in"
00:15:06,00:15:07,a second.
00:15:07,00:15:08,"Yeah, definitely."
00:15:08,00:15:11,"And that, think of all those generations."
00:15:11,00:15:15,"That's one great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, grandfather who has"
00:15:15,00:15:16,70 billion.
00:15:16,00:15:17,"Oh, God."
00:15:17,00:15:18,How do you think you are?
00:15:18,00:15:19,How do you think you are?
00:15:19,00:15:20,How do you think you are?
00:15:20,00:15:21,How do you think you are?
00:15:21,00:15:22,How do you think you are?
00:15:22,00:15:23,How do you think you are?
00:15:23,00:15:24,How do you think you are?
00:15:24,00:15:25,How do you think you are?
00:15:25,00:15:26,How do you think you are?
00:15:26,00:15:27,How do you think you are?
00:15:27,00:15:28,How do you think you are?
00:15:28,00:15:29,They can do it even after they're dead.
00:15:29,00:15:30,Wow.
00:15:30,00:15:34,"Like snowmacks who make this artificial snow, they get dead bacteria, because the bacteria"
00:15:34,00:15:39,"still have the protein on their outside, which can make the water turn into ice, even though"
00:15:39,00:15:40,they're not alive anymore.
00:15:40,00:15:41,Wow.
00:15:41,00:15:47,"It's not a great PR line though, is it, using the dead corpses of billions of bacteria?"
00:15:47,00:15:52,"Well, the thing is, real rain probably has these guys in it as well."
00:15:52,00:15:58,"So most real rain or snow has to have some kind of nucleus, which the water goes around."
00:15:58,00:16:02,"And they think that, generally speaking, it's this particular bacteria that's most common"
00:16:02,00:16:03,in rain around the world.
00:16:03,00:16:04,Really?
00:16:04,00:16:08,"Because all rain starts sort of frozen up there, but then how is the bacteria not able"
00:16:08,00:16:12,to freeze it as well once it's in rain form down with us?
00:16:12,00:16:14,"Yes, because there'll be two warm at that stage."
00:16:14,00:16:16,The bacteria only really works around the zero mark.
00:16:16,00:16:17,Got it.
00:16:17,00:16:19,"And the things are kind of freezing anyway, but you know."
00:16:19,00:16:25,"That's why you don't get many ski slopes in places like Barbados, because the bacteria"
00:16:25,00:16:26,can't do it in the heat.
00:16:26,00:16:28,Have you guys heard of the British gut project?
00:16:28,00:16:29,No.
00:16:29,00:16:34,So I was looking at microbiomes and how there's a theory that your bacteria in your stomach
00:16:34,00:16:35,can affect your mood.
00:16:35,00:16:40,So they don't experiments on mice where mice with no microbes in them got twice as stressed
00:16:40,00:16:43,when scientists freak them out as normal mice did with normal microbiomes.
00:16:43,00:16:45,So there's a theory there.
00:16:45,00:16:50,But the British gut project is this enterprise which is trying to map the whole gut microbiome
00:16:50,00:16:52,of the British population.
00:16:52,00:16:56,And they're basically crowdsourcing poo in the post.
00:16:56,00:16:57,In the post?
00:16:57,00:16:58,Yeah.
00:16:58,00:16:59,But you do have to pay.
00:16:59,00:17:01,You can't just send them poo in the post.
00:17:01,00:17:02,So there's crowd.
00:17:02,00:17:05,How much do I have to pay to put poo in the post?
00:17:05,00:17:11,"It's 75 quid, but they are trying to build up this whole picture of the nation's microbiome"
00:17:11,00:17:12,health.
00:17:12,00:17:14,"They've been done it, tried in America already."
00:17:14,00:17:18,And it's really interesting seeing a whole population's general health.
00:17:18,00:17:19,So they're trying to sequence the DNA.
00:17:19,00:17:22,So they will send you a breakdown of your own DNA.
00:17:22,00:17:25,But it's not going to be a good method to find out the population's health because you're
00:17:25,00:17:29,"only going to get the weirdos, you're willing to shit in an envelope and send it to your"
00:17:29,00:17:30,solitus.
00:17:30,00:17:34,"I can't help but say, if you're upset with the British gut project, how do you show your"
00:17:34,00:17:35,displeasure?
00:17:35,00:17:37,Because you can't send it anywhere in the post.
00:17:37,00:17:40,You send them an empty sample part of the poll and poo.
00:17:40,00:17:41,Wow.
00:17:41,00:17:44,"We're sending them your poo though, because half imagine getting a thing about going, you're"
00:17:44,00:17:45,50% corn.
00:17:45,00:17:50,"You know, just anything that's, I don't think that's how sequencing DNA will help."
00:17:50,00:17:59,"You know when they say that humans and cons, like 75% of the DNA is those guys."
00:17:59,00:18:02,"In China, it's smuggy, I read."
00:18:02,00:18:08,"And there are bacteria that live on the smug, so they live inside the smug and they can"
00:18:08,00:18:09,eat the smug.
00:18:09,00:18:12,"And that sounds like quite cool, doesn't it, because maybe it gets rid of the smug."
00:18:12,00:18:18,"But unfortunately, they fart out even worse chemicals."
00:18:18,00:18:20,So you're just replacing one police with another.
00:18:20,00:18:23,Do we not have another kind of bacteria that can eat the worst chemicals?
00:18:23,00:18:26,I get the feeling that they'll fart something worse after that.
00:18:26,00:18:27,That's really fun.
00:18:27,00:18:37,"OK, it's time for fact number three, and that is Chazinsky."
00:18:37,00:18:41,My fight is that women who were applying to be Qing Dynasty concubines had to spend a
00:18:41,00:18:46,"night sleeping with the Emperor's mother first, so that she could check they didn't"
00:18:46,00:18:47,snore.
00:18:47,00:18:54,"Yeah, so the selection process to be a concubine was so arduous, and there were so many steps"
00:18:54,00:18:55,to it.
00:18:55,00:18:58,"This is actually in this amazing thing that's on the south, it's been published by the South"
00:18:58,00:19:02,"China Morning Post, but it's in collaboration with the Forbidden Palace Museum, and I would"
00:19:02,00:19:03,so recommend it.
00:19:03,00:19:07,They've done a series of chapters detailing life in the Forbidden City.
00:19:07,00:19:11,"And this is about, yeah, so there were these concubines who lived in the Forbidden City with"
00:19:11,00:19:12,the Emperor.
00:19:12,00:19:17,"And to become one, you had to, well, first of all, every single Manchu woman in the kingdom"
00:19:17,00:19:22,"had to apply to become a concubine, so you weren't allowed to marry until you'd applied"
00:19:22,00:19:24,to check the Emperor didn't want to marry you.
00:19:24,00:19:29,"This was all girls between 13 and 16, and they did this sort of call out every three years."
00:19:29,00:19:33,"And then they'd come, and God knows how they whittled it down from that many, but they"
00:19:33,00:19:37,"whittled it down to about a hundred who would be monitored really, really carefully by"
00:19:37,00:19:39,all these females already in the Forbidden City.
00:19:39,00:19:46,"So for things like in squid, skin abnormalities, body odor, they were really strict on body"
00:19:46,00:19:49,"odor, and anything else that might be wrong with them."
00:19:49,00:19:52,And then they were whittled down to finalists who were kind of taught like a finishing school
00:19:52,00:19:53,how to behave.
00:19:53,00:19:54,"It's very much like the X-Factor, isn't it?"
00:19:54,00:19:55,It is.
00:19:55,00:19:56,It's so X-Factor.
00:19:56,00:19:57,Yeah.
00:19:57,00:19:58,Although they don't do the body odor thing.
00:19:58,00:20:04,The X-Factor spend a night sleeping next to Simon Carroll.
00:20:04,00:20:06,But I know how they whittled it down.
00:20:06,00:20:08,It was in that brilliant piece.
00:20:08,00:20:10,So when the Ming dynasty--
00:20:10,00:20:11,Which is the one just before?
00:20:11,00:20:12,Yes.
00:20:12,00:20:13,We've got records of how they whittled it down.
00:20:13,00:20:18,"So they picked 5,000 young women, and then they eliminated 1,000 on the first day for being"
00:20:18,00:20:20,too short or tall or fat or thin.
00:20:20,00:20:25,"And the second day, they got rid of another 2,000 based on their voices and general manner."
00:20:25,00:20:26,"You got 2,000 left."
00:20:26,00:20:28,"Well, that is actually like X-Factor, isn't it?"
00:20:28,00:20:29,Yeah.
00:20:29,00:20:30,It's true.
00:20:30,00:20:34,"And third day, they got rid of another 1,000 because their hands or feet weren't right."
00:20:34,00:20:35,I haven't seen--
00:20:35,00:20:38,"I haven't seen the X-Factor, but I don't think that that fades in."
00:20:38,00:20:39,"So you've got 1,000 left."
00:20:39,00:20:40,"Yeah, foot inspection."
00:20:40,00:20:41,Foot inspection was a massive thing.
00:20:41,00:20:42,Yeah.
00:20:42,00:20:43,Feet are so important.
00:20:43,00:20:44,Feet are so important.
00:20:44,00:20:45,Yeah.
00:20:45,00:20:46,"Then you've got 1,000 left."
00:20:46,00:20:48,"And then you have gynecological examinations, which apparently get rid of another 700."
00:20:48,00:20:49,Wow.
00:20:49,00:20:50,I do not know how.
00:20:50,00:20:55,"I've got to say, I kind of at this stage wish I'd been kicked out for being too tall short"
00:20:55,00:20:57,fat or thin.
00:20:57,00:21:00,And then you have a month of testing for the remaining 300.
00:21:00,00:21:01,Yeah.
00:21:01,00:21:04,"But in that final month, is it right that they get taught sort of incredible skills that"
00:21:04,00:21:08,"they might not have learnt painting, reading, walking."
00:21:08,00:21:09,Yeah.
00:21:09,00:21:10,It was very much my fault.
00:21:10,00:21:12,What kind of walking walking walk?
00:21:12,00:21:17,"One of those skills that you'd never learned, unless you were in Alice, who walked back into"
00:21:17,00:21:18,"your village, you've changed."
00:21:18,00:21:21,[LAUGHTER]
00:21:21,00:21:23,Everyone else were rolling around.
00:21:23,00:21:24,[LAUGHTER]
00:21:24,00:21:25,"Oh, she thinks she's so off herself."
00:21:25,00:21:27,[LAUGHTER]
00:21:27,00:21:30,That was a book that was saying they were taught to have.
00:21:30,00:21:33,"They had to have dainty feet, and they were taught to have a titillating walk."
00:21:33,00:21:34,Yeah.
00:21:34,00:21:40,"But yeah, and sleeping next to the mother, the mother was the final herd, or you had to cross,"
00:21:40,00:21:42,and she was the senior woman.
00:21:42,00:21:43,[LAUGHTER]
00:21:43,00:21:44,What a boss level.
00:21:44,00:21:45,[LAUGHTER]
00:21:45,00:21:48,"How many, do you know, got through to that final phase?"
00:21:48,00:21:52,"I think the finalists, they were 10, I think, or maybe they were 5 at that point, but we were"
00:21:52,00:21:53,down to a manageable number.
00:21:53,00:21:57,"Because the mother doesn't have, you know, there's only one Emperor's mum, so she can't"
00:21:57,00:22:02,"spend all her time unless she sleeps with them all at the same time, but then how do you"
00:22:02,00:22:03,know who's sorry?
00:22:03,00:22:04,Yeah.
00:22:04,00:22:05,"Oh, yes."
00:22:05,00:22:06,You just blame it on the person next to you.
00:22:06,00:22:09,And it was to check for things like sleepwalking or sleep talking.
00:22:09,00:22:12,"All body odors again, she had to be very careful with."
00:22:12,00:22:13,And then you passed.
00:22:13,00:22:16,"But a lot of girls in one part, obviously, because it meant that you had to abandon your village"
00:22:16,00:22:20,and your family and all your friends and live forever in this massive urban city with
00:22:20,00:22:21,this creepy old man.
00:22:21,00:22:22,So.
00:22:22,00:22:23,Yeah.
00:22:23,00:22:27,"You might not come and see you, though, because when the lots of concubines, some of them"
00:22:27,00:22:28,"had tons, didn't they?"
00:22:28,00:22:29,I think.
00:22:29,00:22:30,"Yeah, you had different levels."
00:22:30,00:22:33,"You had your base level concubine, and then it went to higher rankings all the way up to"
00:22:33,00:22:35,"your, the Empress boss level."
00:22:35,00:22:36,Yeah.
00:22:36,00:22:37,Exactly.
00:22:37,00:22:39,"And there were about 20,000 by the chain dynasty."
00:22:39,00:22:40,"20,000 concubines."
00:22:40,00:22:42,"Concubines, consorts."
00:22:42,00:22:43,Yeah.
00:22:43,00:22:44,Blimey.
00:22:44,00:22:45,Where would it be?
00:22:45,00:22:46,"20,000 women in this urban city."
00:22:46,00:22:47,I have some women.
00:22:47,00:22:50,I'm just trying to work out the timings of this.
00:22:50,00:22:51,What?
00:22:51,00:22:52,How?
00:22:52,00:22:55,"How, like, let's say, how many, how many you can have sex with in that amount of time?"
00:22:55,00:22:56,Got us.
00:22:56,00:22:57,Yeah.
00:22:57,00:22:58,"You know, to be frank."
00:22:58,00:22:59,"Well, they did have problems with that."
00:22:59,00:23:05,"It was one emperor called Emperor Wu, not part of the Qing, but he had 5,000 women, too many"
00:23:05,00:23:11,"to either remember who he actually wanted to sleep with, but he knew that they were all"
00:23:11,00:23:12,very pretty.
00:23:12,00:23:15,So what he used to do was go around in a cart that was carried by goats.
00:23:15,00:23:19,"And when the goats got tired, wherever they parked, that's who he went and had sex with"
00:23:19,00:23:20,that night.
00:23:20,00:23:21,Yeah.
00:23:21,00:23:22,That's...
00:23:22,00:23:24,Surely there's an easier way to remember who you fancy.
00:23:24,00:23:25,"He fancied them all, I think."
00:23:25,00:23:26,That's the idea.
00:23:26,00:23:29,"As the concubines, he just thought they're all very beautiful."
00:23:29,00:23:31,"So wherever the goats stop, that's where I'll get off."
00:23:31,00:23:35,And some of the concubines he had cheated.
00:23:35,00:23:40,And many of the concubines actually did want to have relations with him because maybe it
00:23:40,00:23:42,brought children and they would become emperors.
00:23:42,00:23:43,Exactly.
00:23:43,00:23:47,So what they used to do was leave little bits of treats outside the door for the goats to
00:23:47,00:23:50,trick them into stopping.
00:23:50,00:23:55,"And then there's other ones who, because they wanted to make sure that there was not too"
00:23:55,00:23:59,"much jealousy amongst the concubines, because if you slept with one of the concubines,"
00:23:59,00:24:04,that raised her level and suddenly your surrounding concubines might get a bit too jealous and fights
00:24:04,00:24:09,"break out and so on, they used to have a rotation calendar that was done for certain emperors."
00:24:09,00:24:13,So they would make sure that you never slept with the same concubine in the same week or something
00:24:13,00:24:14,like that.
00:24:14,00:24:15,"Sure, right."
00:24:15,00:24:16,And we'd have written records of that.
00:24:16,00:24:20,"So I read on this website, Anna, that you were talking about, that in the 10th century"
00:24:20,00:24:25,"calendars, we used to keep track of the sex life rather than of dates of day life."
00:24:25,00:24:26,Yes.
00:24:26,00:24:27,It was so closely monitored.
00:24:27,00:24:34,You're not saying I'll meet you on the 29th of the Emperor's Shagging Rachel.
00:24:34,00:24:38,And I think we should bring it back in our royal family.
00:24:38,00:24:45,"Yeah, there was a branch of the Imperial Government that was set up in the 1670s called the"
00:24:45,00:24:47,Office of Respectful Service.
00:24:47,00:24:51,And this was to formalise that really and make sure secretaries were installed to keep tabs
00:24:51,00:24:53,on the sexual activities.
00:24:53,00:24:57,"And so every single concubine that visited the bedroom, they'd have to take note of it,"
00:24:57,00:25:00,they'd have to find out what actually happened in there.
00:25:00,00:25:04,"Because again, the ranking system, you haven't had any much."
00:25:04,00:25:05,I found this interesting.
00:25:05,00:25:11,Apparently there was only one monogamous Chinese emperor who was called Hong Xi.
00:25:11,00:25:14,And he was only monogamous because he was extremely close to his mother.
00:25:14,00:25:16,And then his mother was murdered by a concubine.
00:25:16,00:25:18,So that rather put him off the idea of concubines.
00:25:18,00:25:19,Or concubines.
00:25:19,00:25:20,Yeah.
00:25:20,00:25:21,"Except the one, presumably."
00:25:21,00:25:23,I think he took a wife.
00:25:23,00:25:24,He took a wife.
00:25:24,00:25:25,Yeah.
00:25:25,00:25:26,They could do that sometimes.
00:25:26,00:25:27,Couldn't they concubines?
00:25:27,00:25:31,"There was an emperor called Xi-A-Sing, which I'm sure I'm pronouncing wrong."
00:25:31,00:25:36,But 18 of his concubines kind of ganged up on him and tried to kill him.
00:25:36,00:25:40,They drove herpins into his crotch and they wrapped a silk cord around his neck and tried
00:25:40,00:25:41,to strangle him.
00:25:41,00:25:42,Wow.
00:25:42,00:25:51,"The guy with the clipboard in the corner saying, ""I don't know what I record this at."""
00:25:51,00:25:53,Maybe heavy pressing?
00:25:53,00:25:58,"Well, the Empress, emphrasifying, then had all the conspirators killed."
00:25:58,00:26:00,They're all executed.
00:26:00,00:26:07,"But Xi-A-Sing, he decided to move out of the Imperial Palace and became a Taoist magician"
00:26:07,00:26:12,who spent his whole life having sex with virgins and drinking magic potions made from bodily
00:26:12,00:26:13,fluids.
00:26:13,00:26:14,Wow.
00:26:14,00:26:15,He infected him quite badly.
00:26:15,00:26:16,"It's, yeah."
00:26:16,00:26:17,Is that...
00:26:17,00:26:18,And that council is being a magician?
00:26:18,00:26:22,It's only been disappointed if I went to a magic show and all he did was drink blood and urine
00:26:22,00:26:24,and have sex with virgins.
00:26:24,00:26:29,You've clearly never been to a day of a blind track.
00:26:29,00:26:31,I think the magic was other stuff.
00:26:31,00:26:32,Right.
00:26:32,00:26:33,Did he stay as emperor?
00:26:33,00:26:37,"He did, but basically he just ignored all of his duties that he was supposed to do as"
00:26:37,00:26:38,emperor.
00:26:38,00:26:39,Wow.
00:26:39,00:26:40,And did all this magic and...
00:26:40,00:26:41,I'm so annoying.
00:26:41,00:26:42,I'm so annoying.
00:26:42,00:26:45,"If the Empress had got a magic show, he'd be constantly trying to show you another trick."
00:26:45,00:26:52,"I'm saying that we are at war with four separate groups of people, could we have some decisions,"
00:26:52,00:26:53,please?
00:26:53,00:26:55,"Oh, pick a card."
00:26:55,00:26:59,"Just on Unix, so because they were the other group of people that were allowed in the"
00:26:59,00:27:03,"Forbidden City, you couldn't have men with their parts because then they might impregnate"
00:27:03,00:27:04,the women.
00:27:04,00:27:08,So there were thousands and thousands of Unix and it was actually a good gig because it's
00:27:08,00:27:12,the only way you can work really close to the emperor in his government.
00:27:12,00:27:15,But I think there was one drawback.
00:27:15,00:27:19,The application process was a bit tedious.
00:27:19,00:27:26,"Imagine if they chop your cock off and then they said, ""Sorry, you snore."""
00:27:26,00:27:31,But the way they did it was they put you on a chair with a hole in the seat.
00:27:31,00:27:32,"Oh, really?"
00:27:32,00:27:36,And then you just whip something underneath it and it's gone.
00:27:36,00:27:38,"I mean, it was the testicles that were really..."
00:27:38,00:27:39,It was the piece of hole.
00:27:39,00:27:40,It was the piece of hole.
00:27:40,00:27:41,"Yes, yeah."
00:27:41,00:27:42,You got to get rid of it.
00:27:42,00:27:45,And I think we've said they used to then have to carry them around in a pouch we've mentioned
00:27:45,00:27:46,before.
00:27:46,00:27:51,"Which they were proud of, the last Unix of China, fell out with his family when they threw"
00:27:51,00:27:52,his genitals away.
00:27:52,00:27:55,The Unix never spoke to his family again off the back.
00:27:55,00:27:56,I think that's fair enough.
00:27:56,00:27:59,I would be so annoyed if my mum threw away a body part of mine.
00:27:59,00:28:00,Yes.
00:28:00,00:28:02,Your car is on or off.
00:28:02,00:28:06,When you go back to visit your parents and they've like changed your bedroom and they turn
00:28:06,00:28:07,into a study or something.
00:28:07,00:28:08,Yeah.
00:28:08,00:28:09,That's really upsetting.
00:28:09,00:28:10,"Yeah, that's true."
00:28:10,00:28:15,So the reason they threw it away is because during the cultural revolution there was a whole
00:28:15,00:28:19,thing about you need to discard anything that was seen as old society.
00:28:19,00:28:23,"And if you had anything that was old society, yeah, you put your whole family at risk because"
00:28:23,00:28:25,you own something from...
00:28:25,00:28:28,So they saw his genitals as part of that tradition.
00:28:28,00:28:29,Oh my goodness.
00:28:29,00:28:30,"Yeah, so they threw it away."
00:28:30,00:28:31,That's amazing.
00:28:31,00:28:32,And think about his life.
00:28:32,00:28:33,"This guy, Sonia Teng, the last Unix."
00:28:33,00:28:34,He died in 1996.
00:28:34,00:28:35,Yeah.
00:28:35,00:28:36,Wow.
00:28:36,00:28:37,Really recent history.
00:28:37,00:28:38,Yeah.
00:28:38,00:28:43,"I don't know how you pronounce that word, but Conky Binage, Conky Binage, was only banned"
00:28:43,00:28:44,in Hong Kong in 1972.
00:28:44,00:28:45,Wow.
00:28:45,00:28:46,Yeah.
00:28:46,00:28:48,"And it's still not uncommon, I think."
00:28:48,00:28:52,It's not as frowned upon to have lots of mistresses in our parts of China.
00:28:52,00:28:56,"And there's a saying in China, well, someone who's Chinese on the internet said, ""We've got"
00:28:56,00:29:00,"a popular saying,"" which explains why Chinese men need multiple women."
00:29:00,00:29:03,But women are expected to just have one man.
00:29:03,00:29:07,"And it goes, ""One teapot is usually accompanied by four cups."
00:29:07,00:29:10,"Have you ever seen one cup with four teapots?"""
00:29:10,00:29:14,"Sounds similar to something I have seen on the internet, but..."
00:29:14,00:29:15,Oh!
00:29:15,00:29:19,"Two conkybings, one cup, so I can't say that."
00:29:19,00:29:23,"Completely different, but equally profound meaning to that."
00:29:23,00:29:27,"Conkybinging sounds like an old, old Netflix kind of."
00:29:27,00:29:28,It's not conkybinging.
00:29:28,00:29:32,Conkybinging just sounds like you're chucking them out.
00:29:32,00:29:37,"Oh, well, there is a good argument for conkybinging because there's a new TV show in China"
00:29:37,00:29:42,"which is about Yangtze Palace, and it's hugely popular."
00:29:42,00:29:46,"It's the most Googled TV show of the year 2018, despite the fact that Google is largely banned"
00:29:46,00:29:47,in China.
00:29:47,00:29:51,"That's how hugely popular it is, all across Asia, lots of other countries as well."
00:29:51,00:29:58,"It's been streamed 15 billion times, and it's about a rivalry between conkybines in the"
00:29:58,00:29:59,forbidden city.
00:29:59,00:30:02,So conkybinging is actually a perfect word for watching the show.
00:30:02,00:30:06,"15 billion, that means everyone on average has watched it twice."
00:30:06,00:30:07,I know.
00:30:07,00:30:08,That's...
00:30:08,00:30:09,Yeah.
00:30:09,00:30:10,I'm just saying it's a lot.
00:30:10,00:30:11,It's a lot.
00:30:11,00:30:15,"But I guess there are billions of people who haven't seen it, so someone's watched at least"
00:30:15,00:30:16,three times.
00:30:16,00:30:17,Yeah.
00:30:17,00:30:20,I've watched it two million times.
00:30:20,00:30:23,I think there are just a billion people in Asia.
00:30:23,00:30:25,"A billion people in China, aren't there?"
00:30:25,00:30:26,"Yeah, one point three."
00:30:26,00:30:27,Yeah.
00:30:27,00:30:28,And more outside that.
00:30:28,00:30:29,But still within Asia.
00:30:29,00:30:30,Yeah.
00:30:30,00:30:32,Asia's population is very high.
00:30:32,00:30:33,I know.
00:30:33,00:30:38,I shouldn't have been surprised that 15 billion is a lot.
00:30:38,00:30:39,"I mean, how many people live in Asia?"
00:30:39,00:30:40,Is it about four billion?
00:30:40,00:30:41,It's a very large population.
00:30:41,00:30:42,All of Asia.
00:30:42,00:30:43,They include in India.
00:30:43,00:30:44,"Oh, no."
00:30:44,00:30:45,Cheating.
00:30:45,00:30:46,"Oh, I'm including India."
00:30:46,00:30:47,"Oh, right."
00:30:47,00:30:48,Then five.
00:30:48,00:30:49,Yeah.
00:30:49,00:30:53,"One point three billion in China, one point three billion in India, probably about one hundred"
00:30:53,00:30:55,million in Bangladesh or something.
00:30:55,00:30:56,Right.
00:30:56,00:30:57,Indonesia.
00:30:57,00:30:58,It's not a biggie.
00:30:58,00:30:59,But they've still all seen it more than twice.
00:30:59,00:31:00,That's the amazing thing.
00:31:00,00:31:01,"Even all of these people, you know."
00:31:01,00:31:03,How do they get anything done?
00:31:03,00:31:04,"Well, there's China so productive."
00:31:04,00:31:07,They're all constantly watching this thing.
00:31:07,00:31:11,[MUSIC PLAYING]
00:31:11,00:31:12,OK.
00:31:12,00:31:14,It's time for our final fact of the show.
00:31:14,00:31:15,And that is my fact.
00:31:15,00:31:21,My fact this week is that some meteors skim off the earth as if they were a stone skimming
00:31:21,00:31:23,across the waters.
00:31:23,00:31:24,That's very good.
00:31:24,00:31:25,But who is throwing them?
00:31:25,00:31:26,"Yes, good question."
00:31:26,00:31:27,It's so profound.
00:31:27,00:31:28,I know.
00:31:28,00:31:29,I've made that a bit more poetic.
00:31:29,00:31:33,"Probably scientists listening are thinking, you dick, that's not what they do."
00:31:33,00:31:37,"So, but they don't skim off the earth if you count the earth as the ground that we walk"
00:31:37,00:31:38,"on, do they?"
00:31:38,00:31:39,No.
00:31:39,00:31:40,Exactly.
00:31:40,00:31:41,That would be the best fact we've ever done.
00:31:41,00:31:42,[LAUGHTER]
00:31:42,00:31:43,If no one knew that.
00:31:43,00:31:44,"What this is, is--"
00:31:44,00:31:46,[LAUGHTER]
00:31:46,00:31:47,This is meteors.
00:31:47,00:31:50,"Too much of it if the betrayal that came to kill the dinosaurs just went, ""Why are you"
00:31:50,00:31:51,"on your own?"""
00:31:51,00:31:52,[LAUGHTER]
00:31:52,00:31:53,Straight back into space.
00:31:53,00:31:55,That would be extraordinary.
00:31:55,00:31:59,"What this is is, we obviously-- we have an atmosphere and the atmosphere is what"
00:31:59,00:32:00,burns up.
00:32:00,00:32:04,"When we call a meteorite, it's because it goes through a layer of the atmosphere."
00:32:04,00:32:07,"It's very cold, burns it up, and then that lands on the earth."
00:32:07,00:32:12,"Sometimes, when a meteor comes into the earth's atmosphere, it's on such an angle, almost"
00:32:12,00:32:16,"a parallel angle to the earth's atmosphere, that it just bounces off."
00:32:16,00:32:18,They're called earth grazers.
00:32:18,00:32:19,They don't make it down further.
00:32:19,00:32:24,"They literally get a lift, a boost off the atmosphere, pushing it back up."
00:32:24,00:32:28,"Sometimes slowing at speed, but it makes it back out and just hurdles back into space."
00:32:28,00:32:31,Latch it if you could skim it off the earth and then off Mars and then off the earth.
00:32:31,00:32:32,[LAUGHTER]
00:32:32,00:32:35,Wouldn't that be extraordinary?
00:32:35,00:32:38,"We know that it happens a lot, and a lot of people have seen it with the naked eye, but"
00:32:38,00:32:41,we haven't actually recorded too many of these.
00:32:41,00:32:46,"I believe in 2006 was only the fourth time that we've ever caught in camera, what is known"
00:32:46,00:32:49,"as the earth grazers, the ones that come in and skim off."
00:32:49,00:32:51,So what does it look when you sit with the naked eye?
00:32:51,00:32:54,"Does it look like a meteor, but it just does burn up?"
00:32:54,00:32:59,"No, it does burn up, so you see the flaming meteorites as it were coming in, but because"
00:32:59,00:33:02,"of the angle, it suddenly just takes a turn and heads off."
00:33:02,00:33:04,But do you see it take a turn then with the naked eye?
00:33:04,00:33:08,"Well, I guess what you see is the flame go out."
00:33:08,00:33:12,"You just see, yeah, you see it's drinking across the sky and then kind of finishing."
00:33:12,00:33:17,Is it right to say then that it comes in and it goes very slightly into the earth's atmosphere
00:33:17,00:33:20,"and then bounces out again, so when it's in the earth's atmosphere, that's when it's"
00:33:20,00:33:23,"burning up and that's what you see, but then it disappears."
00:33:23,00:33:24,Exactly.
00:33:24,00:33:29,"So in 2006, there was one, it was just, it was a bright fireball is what you would have seen"
00:33:29,00:33:36,in the sky and this was seen over Japan and it made it to 55 miles from the earth's surface.
00:33:36,00:33:37,Wow.
00:33:37,00:33:38,So that gets really close.
00:33:38,00:33:40,And then it just looked down and thought no.
00:33:40,00:33:41,"Right, man."
00:33:41,00:33:42,These guys look lame.
00:33:42,00:33:48,"Yeah, so it was, it was there for 35 seconds that you could see it and yeah, so and then"
00:33:48,00:33:53,"it just disappears back out into, back into space and in the distance, it's crazy."
00:33:53,00:33:58,"This is actually related to that or not about meteors, but with spaceships, that same effect"
00:33:58,00:34:02,is a major concern they have when bringing spaceships back to earth.
00:34:02,00:34:05,So one of the hardest things if you're controlling a spaceship is re-entering because you have
00:34:05,00:34:09,to get the angle at which you re-enter completely spot on.
00:34:09,00:34:14,"And if you go to sharpen angle, then you're going to fast and there's too much friction"
00:34:14,00:34:18,"and then you burn up, but if you're going to shallow an angle, if it is really shallow,"
00:34:18,00:34:22,"then again, there's this risk because the earth is a sphere that you'll sort of skim"
00:34:22,00:34:25,"across the atmosphere, but then come back off of it."
00:34:25,00:34:26,And miss it.
00:34:26,00:34:27,"Yeah, miss the earth."
00:34:27,00:34:30,You'd have thought it was a big enough target.
00:34:30,00:34:34,So one of the biggest problems with Apollo 13 as they came around from the other side of
00:34:34,00:34:39,"the moon was on top of everything else is that because their instruments were down, that"
00:34:39,00:34:40,exact thing was going to happen to them.
00:34:40,00:34:43,They were not on the right trajectory to come back into earth.
00:34:43,00:34:48,"So they had to make a thrust, basically with the naked eye, with the earth in the distance"
00:34:48,00:34:54,"using that as a target to get themself back into the right position, otherwise that might"
00:34:54,00:34:55,have happened to them.
00:34:55,00:35:00,"Although, I've read a few things, and maybe James, you know about this, about things wouldn't"
00:35:00,00:35:01,really bounce off the earth.
00:35:01,00:35:03,You don't just bounce off into the distance.
00:35:03,00:35:04,"No, of course not."
00:35:04,00:35:09,"So there's no spring that you can hit, there's no solidity in the earth, but it's just the"
00:35:09,00:35:11,fact that the earth is circular.
00:35:11,00:35:13,"So the earth was flat, which some people argue."
00:35:13,00:35:24,Here we go.
00:35:24,00:35:28,"It's just that it can't get through those dense layers, so it effectively goes straight."
00:35:28,00:35:31,"But because the earth is a curve, then it comes straight off it again."
00:35:31,00:35:35,There's another kind of quite cool earth grazing thing that you can watch.
00:35:35,00:35:37,A few people have been lucky to see it.
00:35:37,00:35:39,It's called a meteor procession.
00:35:39,00:35:40,This is really cool.
00:35:40,00:35:45,"When it does come into that zone of the atmosphere, where it starts heating up, often a meteor will"
00:35:45,00:35:46,break into little bits.
00:35:46,00:35:50,And that's sometimes when we see meteor showers and so on.
00:35:50,00:35:51,It's why you see so many.
00:35:51,00:35:55,"So what will happen is this meteor will come in, it'll start breaking up into bits, but still"
00:35:55,00:35:59,enough of it is there to head back out into space and not come down.
00:35:59,00:36:04,"However, it will now be about 10 of them that will fly back off into space."
00:36:04,00:36:07,"So you'll just see what looks like because they're all on the same trajectory, just like"
00:36:07,00:36:11,"an Arab show, a procession going over you, flying over it by flaming balls."
00:36:11,00:36:12,Yeah.
00:36:12,00:36:15,"It's kind of like a meteor shower in a way, which is always fun."
00:36:15,00:36:18,"And I didn't realise that I think this is going to be one of those things that I, it's"
00:36:18,00:36:19,unbelievable.
00:36:19,00:36:20,I didn't know.
00:36:20,00:36:24,"But I didn't know that meteor showers happened, so regularly, like at the same time, every"
00:36:24,00:36:28,"single year, and that they're all named after the constellation they come from, which is"
00:36:28,00:36:29,nice.
00:36:29,00:36:31,So you've got Orionids or Geminiids.
00:36:31,00:36:36,"And they're at 112 meteor showers every year, always happen at the same time, because"
00:36:36,00:36:38,it's where the earth just intersects with the comet tail at the same time.
00:36:38,00:36:43,"And I guess over many thousands of years, then it changes, as the comet moves away."
00:36:43,00:36:44,Yeah.
00:36:44,00:36:45,I didn't really know that.
00:36:45,00:36:48,"How do you say, is it the perseid, or the perseid?"
00:36:48,00:36:52,"So the perseid meteor shower that people might have seen, that is cool."
00:36:52,00:36:54,I just quite like this origin of what it's called.
00:36:54,00:36:57,It's usually referred to as the tears of St. Lawrence.
00:36:57,00:37:02,"And that is after St. Lawrence, who is that Christian Deacon, who the Romans burnt him"
00:37:02,00:37:09,"in AD258, and he's the one who, you know, they put him on a barbecue, roasted on a barbecue."
00:37:09,00:37:13,"And then he, apparently, according to legend, was the guy that said, ""I am already roasted"
00:37:13,00:37:14,on one side.
00:37:14,00:37:18,"If you would have me well cooked, it is time to turn me on to the other."""
00:37:18,00:37:19,It's such a great story.
00:37:19,00:37:20,It's so lovely.
00:37:20,00:37:21,It's so lovely.
00:37:21,00:37:24,"So what you actually said, was that?"
00:37:24,00:37:26,"Well, that was that in Latin."
00:37:26,00:37:30,"I've got a religious connection to all this, too."
00:37:30,00:37:32,So there is an argument.
00:37:32,00:37:35,"It's only an argument, and we'll never know the truth, but there's an argument that."
00:37:35,00:37:38,There's a bit in the Bible where St. Paul has a conversion.
00:37:38,00:37:39,He's on the road to Damascus.
00:37:39,00:37:41,"He's called something else before that, and then he becomes Paul."
00:37:41,00:37:42,It's called Saul.
00:37:42,00:37:43,He's called Saul.
00:37:43,00:37:45,And Saul becomes Paul.
00:37:45,00:37:50,"So there is an argument that he just saw a meteor, because in the account, there are several"
00:37:50,00:37:51,different accounts of it.
00:37:51,00:37:52,"He sees a big flash, I think."
00:37:52,00:37:53,Exactly.
00:37:53,00:37:54,He says it's brighter than the sun.
00:37:54,00:37:56,It can be brighter than the sun.
00:37:56,00:37:57,He fell over.
00:37:57,00:37:58,Take.
00:37:58,00:37:59,That would happen.
00:37:59,00:38:00,Why?
00:38:00,00:38:01,It's a shockwave if a meteor arrives.
00:38:01,00:38:02,Oh.
00:38:02,00:38:03,Take.
00:38:03,00:38:04,Really?
00:38:04,00:38:05,He also says he heard a big noise.
00:38:05,00:38:06,Take.
00:38:06,00:38:08,"And he was blinded, which could happen."
00:38:08,00:38:09,"Well, but do you know that?"
00:38:09,00:38:11,That also could be a truck.
00:38:11,00:38:12,Couldn't it?
00:38:12,00:38:13,"No, I don't think it lights."
00:38:13,00:38:14,I don't think it lights.
00:38:14,00:38:15,Yeah.
00:38:15,00:38:16,Paul's over.
00:38:16,00:38:17,Take.
00:38:17,00:38:18,Loud noise.
00:38:18,00:38:19,Take.
00:38:19,00:38:20,That's true.
00:38:20,00:38:22,And it would have been more miraculous in a way to produce a truck at that time.
00:38:22,00:38:27,"Hey, just speaking of that idea you said of, it's not as crazy as a meteorite hitting the"
00:38:27,00:38:30,Earth's surface itself and bouncing off.
00:38:30,00:38:31,"Oh, yeah."
00:38:31,00:38:40,"There is a Mars, 2.5 million years ago, a rock left the surface of Mars, shot out into space,"
00:38:40,00:38:48,"then in 1962, that rock finally landed on Earth as a meteorite in Nigeria, in Zagami."
00:38:48,00:38:51,And it's known as the Zagami meteorite.
00:38:51,00:38:56,"And sometimes soon in the future, that very same bit of meteorite is going to become a meteorite"
00:38:56,00:38:59,"again, except this time, back on Mars."
00:38:59,00:39:04,"Because in 1996, we put some of that meteorite back onto a ship."
00:39:04,00:39:07,So we've relaunched it out of our planet.
00:39:07,00:39:11,"And it's part of the Mars Global Survey, which has been going around Mars, but we've lost"
00:39:11,00:39:12,contact with.
00:39:12,00:39:16,"So very soon that satellite is going to go into, it's going to be sucked in by the orbit"
00:39:16,00:39:17,of Mars.
00:39:17,00:39:18,It's going to be so pissed off.
00:39:18,00:39:22,"In that, if you're like, I've traveled for 2.5 million years to get away from that place"
00:39:22,00:39:24,and you've literally just put me straight back.
00:39:24,00:39:25,That's true.
00:39:25,00:39:26,"That's incredible, though."
00:39:26,00:39:30,"It's like a cool poetic justice, isn't it?"
00:39:30,00:39:34,I think it's amazing how these rocks get from one place to another.
00:39:34,00:39:41,"Like for instance, when the dinosaur asteroid came down, it breaks through the atmosphere,"
00:39:41,00:39:44,"basically pushes all the atmosphere out of the way, causes a vacuum."
00:39:44,00:39:48,"And so when it hits the ground, the loads of rocks come up, they all get sucked into space."
00:39:48,00:39:49,Oh wow.
00:39:49,00:39:54,And so you could theoretically have some rocks from the dinosaur age that have since made
00:39:54,00:39:59,"it onto the moon, and they could theoretically be dinosaur fossils, obviously."
00:39:59,00:40:02,"In fit, like probably not, but theoretically it could be."
00:40:02,00:40:08,"There was an article about this recently, there's a piece of rock that they think maybe"
00:40:08,00:40:10,"it's from Earth, but they can't, they need to do more tests."
00:40:10,00:40:14,"In fact, that one you are talking about, I think they do, like you say, they're not sharp,"
00:40:14,00:40:18,"but they're pretty sure it is from the Earth, because it was the way you can tell it how"
00:40:18,00:40:22,"it was formed, and it was formed in a way that either it's from the Earth or they have"
00:40:22,00:40:25,to change the way that the history of the moon is.
00:40:25,00:40:28,"Right, because they think it couldn't have come up to the surface of the moon in the right"
00:40:28,00:40:29,times.
00:40:29,00:40:34,"It's a bit complicated, but yeah, that could be the oldest known Earth rock, and they found"
00:40:34,00:40:35,it on the moon.
00:40:35,00:40:41,"It's about 4 billion years old, it's incredible, is it because they brought it back to it?"
00:40:41,00:40:42,They must have done that.
00:40:42,00:40:44,"Yeah, it came on Apollo 14, I think."
00:40:44,00:40:46,What are the odds of bringing back?
00:40:46,00:40:48,Did you come back with some moon samples?
00:40:48,00:40:49,We've got some bad news.
00:40:49,00:40:50,We feel so stupid.
00:40:50,00:40:55,Probably that spaceship crossed with the Martian one and the two rocks waved at each other
00:40:55,00:40:56,"going, ""Go back home, yeah, go back home."""
00:40:56,00:41:00,Why have we got such strict immigration laws in the universe when we keep on sending
00:41:00,00:41:02,fun rocks back when they came through?
00:41:02,00:41:07,"No wonder conspiracy theorists don't think we went, the only rocks we've got are fucking"
00:41:07,00:41:10,from here anyway.
00:41:10,00:41:12,Can I just say one thing about just about the Tunguska?
00:41:12,00:41:17,"So the Tunguska event was this massive explosion, we'll see in 1908, it was so big, it"
00:41:17,00:41:22,"cast light over the whole world and at the time the night, the night skies glowed so brightly"
00:41:22,00:41:29,"that people in Asia, which we know is heavily populated, so probably quite a lot of people,"
00:41:29,00:41:34,people in Asia read their newspapers outdoors at midnight and apparently at least one golfer
00:41:34,00:41:39,got in a round at 2.30 in the morning in St Andrews and Scotland.
00:41:39,00:41:40,That's amazing.
00:41:40,00:41:41,That's you.
00:41:41,00:41:42,"That's the 1908 version of you, James."
00:41:42,00:41:48,"Does it look like the world's ending here, wow, I think I could get diving in there."
00:41:48,00:41:54,"So a meteor, heading towards the earth, if it's a small-ish size, we would call that, let's"
00:41:54,00:41:58,"say a meteor, a meteoroid meteorite in the earth, if it was bigger, it's an asteroid, right?"
00:41:58,00:42:00,So it's a sightseeing.
00:42:00,00:42:05,"So in movies, whenever we try to prevent an asteroid from hitting the earth, they always"
00:42:05,00:42:10,send up some kind of big nuclear device to blow it up and there's so many plans going
00:42:10,00:42:15,on with NASA and independent bodies of scientists who are trying to work out the best way to stop
00:42:15,00:42:18,potential asteroids from hitting the earth.
00:42:18,00:42:22,And there's something that want to wrap it in a sail and sort of sail it in a different
00:42:22,00:42:23,direction.
00:42:23,00:42:27,But one thing I read is they don't ever really want to go for the nuclear option because
00:42:27,00:42:31,obviously you blow it up and then suddenly you're sending a lot of rocks to earth.
00:42:31,00:42:36,"But what I didn't realize is they're nuclear rocks now, so you've made them radioactive."
00:42:36,00:42:42,So you would actually just make the whole situation doubly worse by spreading radiation everywhere
00:42:42,00:42:43,where it hit.
00:42:43,00:42:46,"I mean, we have this ridiculous policy where we can't bring a strand of hair into space"
00:42:46,00:42:51,in case it infects Mars and I can't believe that I'm considering sending radioactive rocks
00:42:51,00:42:52,out into space.
00:42:52,00:42:53,Yeah.
00:42:53,00:42:54,"I think the key would be to push it, wouldn't it?"
00:42:54,00:42:58,That's the current best theory because there's a guy at NASA who's called the planetary
00:42:58,00:43:00,protection officer.
00:43:00,00:43:04,"He's an awesome guy, but he's very low-key about the whole thing, so his name is Lindley"
00:43:04,00:43:09,"Johnson, and he's responsible for it basically, but he's only got eight members of staff."
00:43:09,00:43:12,"So if we get hit by an asteroid, is it his fault?"
00:43:12,00:43:13,Effectively.
00:43:13,00:43:17,"But he was asked about it, he said, ""Do you feel a little pressure being the planetary protection"
00:43:17,00:43:18,"officer?"""
00:43:18,00:43:20,"And he said, ""It doesn't stress me out that much."""
00:43:20,00:43:27,"Well, I want someone to be a bit more, but actually, because who does he answer to if we"
00:43:27,00:43:29,do get all annihilated by an asteroid?
00:43:29,00:43:36,"Well, he's going to go into the cockroach's office and cockroach will say, ""Well done."""
00:43:36,00:43:44,You've been working for us all this time.
