00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,220
 "Hello and welcome to another episode of no such thing as a fish, a weekly podcast

2
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:23,680
 coming to you from the QI offices in Covenant Garden.

3
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:28,800
 My name is Dan Schreiber, I'm sitting here with James Harkin, Andrew Hunter Murray, and

4
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:33,280
 Aniches Insky, and once again we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite

5
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:39,960
 facts from the last seven days, and in no particular order, here we go, starting with you, Andy."

6
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:44,120
 My Vectors that when Britain declared war in 1914, they accidentally did it in the wrong

7
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:49,320
 format and they had to swap the letters, otherwise Britain would not technically be at war.

8
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:51,120
 "Well, what kind of farm that was?

9
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:56,620
 I don't know, I don't know if it was in landscape or in some kind of... what they declared

10
00:00:56,620 --> 00:01:01,400
 with a painter or in a m... or emojis or so, I don't know, I have no idea.

11
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:05,560
 But this is from an article in Times Literary Supplement, which is great by the way, highly

12
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:09,540
 recommended, and there was a British diplomat called Harold Nicholson who was working at

13
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:14,380
 the foreign office, and one day he was told, "We've declared war on Germany, but we screwed

14
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:18,900
 it up," and we sent the letter which doesn't quite say the right phrase, I think.

15
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:24,380
 I think what it was was, they thought that Germany had declared war because they intercepted

16
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:29,800
 some thing over their radio waves, but actually Germany hadn't declared war, and so the letter

17
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:33,900
 said, "We accept your declaration of war, but what they actually wanted to say was, we declare

18
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:34,900
 war on you."

19
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:39,700
 Ah, because Britain was obliged to go to the defence of Belgium and Germany have violated

20
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:45,320
 a Belgian territory, and so, yeah, so... that's a sort of, you can't fire me, I quit, situation

21
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:46,320
 isn't it?

22
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:47,320
 It's very much like that.

23
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:52,260
 Yeah, it's like getting a text message saying, "I'm having an affair too," and then you

24
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:54,260
 have to withdraw that.

25
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:55,260
 And just say.

26
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:56,260
 And just say, "I'm having an affair."

27
00:01:56,260 --> 00:01:58,620
 It's like getting the text message saying, "I'm having an affair," and then your spouse

28
00:01:58,620 --> 00:01:59,620
 says, "I wasn't having an affair.

29
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:00,620
 What are you talking about?"

30
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:05,860
 Guys, I really think you should do these kind of things face to face.

31
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:10,300
 But Nicholson had to go to the German embassy at night, and he went so late in the day that

32
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:15,300
 the German ambassador, who was Prince Lichnovsky, he was in his pajamas in his bedroom, and he

33
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:19,960
 had the letter declaring war on a tray by his bed, and Nicholson had to do the old switch

34
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,960
 to Rue.

35
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:24,040
 And he says that he didn't notice, the Prince didn't notice.

36
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:27,960
 He thought it was just a social visit to say, "Well, sorry, we're a war now."

37
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:30,960
 And was this, this was after they'd officially declared war, it was just they were like, "Oh,

38
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:31,960
 we've got a bit of the paperwork wrong.

39
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:32,960
 We've got to swap that."

40
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,960
 It was that evening, yeah.

41
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:35,960
 It was that evening, yeah.

42
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:41,160
 So what had happened was Britain had given an automaton to Germany, saying, "If you don't

43
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:44,880
 get out of Belgium, we're going to declare war," and then it got to the evening and they

44
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:48,620
 thought Germany had declared war, but they hadn't, and then when it got to midnight,

45
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:50,620
 that was our automaton had kind of hit then.

46
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:51,620
 It was actually 11pm.

47
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:52,620
 11pm, sorry.

48
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:53,620
 It's very important.

49
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:54,620
 It is.

50
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:55,620
 Very important.

51
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:59,660
 You see, if I wasn't charged, we'd never go to war, would we?

52
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:02,620
 But poor old Lichnovsky was so upset, wasn't he?

53
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:06,140
 So he was the ambassador, and I always think ambassadors must have such a difficult job

54
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:09,300
 in war, because they're friends with everyone in the country they're in.

55
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:12,300
 So he was mates with all the Brits.

56
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:17,060
 He was very good friends with Asquith, and his wife, Margot Asquith, so Margot Asquith's

57
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:23,020
 wife, actually went to visit Lichnovsky about an hour or two before war was properly declared

58
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:25,460
 and just went to comfort him and say, "Sorry, this is rough, isn't it?"

59
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:27,700
 And he was sobbing, saying, "It's all over."

60
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:32,500
 And he knew Nicholson as well, so yeah, because when Nicholson went to visit him, he was

61
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:33,500
 in his night clothes.

62
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:36,500
 The last thing he said to him was, "Give my best regards to your father.

63
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:39,500
 I shall not, in all probability, see him before my departure."

64
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:40,500
 Yeah.

65
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,500
 And they hated the Germans.

66
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:43,500
 He's good.

67
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:44,500
 Who did the German ambassador?

68
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:49,500
 Yeah, so the ambassador's wife said to Margot Asquith on just the second of August, so two days

69
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:54,220
 before we went to war, to think that we should bring such sorrows to an innocent and happy

70
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:55,220
 people.

71
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:59,140
 I've always hated and loathed our Kaiser, having not said so a thousand times here in his

72
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:00,740
 friends were all Brits.

73
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:02,420
 So they were not pleased about it.

74
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:06,380
 No, and I suppose if you are an ambassador, you're going to have a more rounded world view,

75
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:07,380
 aren't you?

76
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:08,380
 Yeah.

77
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:09,380
 You know, probably, I don't know.

78
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:10,380
 Yeah.

79
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:11,380
 I've never been one.

80
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:16,980
 I'm sorry, just on Nicholson, then he later went on, people might have heard of him, because

81
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:24,180
 he later went on to marry writer Vita Sackfield West in a kind of marriage of convenience, because

82
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:28,700
 I think he was gay and she was a lesbian, or they were maybe both bisexual, but they kind

83
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:33,220
 of got married so that she could inherit her ancestral home of Sissinghurst.

84
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:36,540
 I'm sure it wasn't a phrasing mistake, and he didn't mean to say, "You're not going

85
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:37,540
 to like something like that."

86
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:38,540
 Yeah.

87
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:39,540
 He accidentally wrote, "Would you marry me?"

88
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:40,540
 I'm sorry.

89
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:41,820
 I meant to say, "I don't."

90
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:46,620
 I've not heard of her, is she a big author?

91
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:50,140
 She's a poet, and she's quite famous.

92
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:51,140
 Cool.

93
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:54,060
 I obviously know her, because she has a weird name, right?

94
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:55,060
 Yeah.

95
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:56,780
 It kind of sticks in your head, doesn't it?

96
00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:57,780
 Yeah.

97
00:04:57,780 --> 00:05:00,860
 So George the Fifth also, sort of, lots of people declare war.

98
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:04,420
 Officially, George the Fifth is one of the people who sort of announced the nation that we

99
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:07,820
 were at war, and his diary is very interesting, because it's so matter of fact.

100
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:13,540
 So his diary on that night, he wrote it just before he went to sleep, and it was a short

101
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:14,540
 entry.

102
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:17,900
 He said, "I held a council at 10.45 in the evening to declare war with Germany.

103
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:21,020
 It is a terrible catastrophe, but it is not our fault."

104
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:24,620
 And then he said, "The crowds were all cheering."

105
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:27,860
 When they heard war had been declared, the cheering was even more terrific, went to Bennett

106
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:28,860
 Midnight.

107
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:31,900
 And that's just, that's the start of the first world war for you.

108
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:32,900
 Oh, yeah.

109
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:35,500
 There were loads of, because they had a speech in Parliament, didn't they?

110
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:38,220
 Was it grey or someone did a speech in Parliament?

111
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:42,780
 And everyone was outside kind of expecting that war was going to be declared.

112
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:47,820
 And there was a mob in London who attacked the German Embassy, and at the same time there

113
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:52,220
 was a mob in Germany that attacked the British Embassy in Berlin, throwing stones.

114
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:54,820
 That is kind of a microcosm of the next four years.

115
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:55,820
 Yes.

116
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:59,540
 There's someone else who we know where they were when war broke out, and it's Adolf Hitler.

117
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:03,940
 And the interesting thing is we know, because there was a photograph taken of this huge crowd

118
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:08,060
 in Munich at a place called the Odian Plats, and they're all celebrating.

119
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:11,020
 There's lots of people, lots of crowds all over Europe celebrated the outbreak of war.

120
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:12,580
 They thought it was a good thing.

121
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:18,500
 And you can see, if you zoom in, Hitler in the crowd with a really big droopy moustache.

122
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:19,500
 Really?

123
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:20,500
 Yeah.

124
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:21,500
 But this is the crazy thing.

125
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:26,620
 So the photo was taken by a photographer who later became Hitler's official photographer,

126
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:31,300
 and in one of the very early bits of Nazi propaganda, Hitler, they tracked down this

127
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:35,380
 photo, they saw you saw Hitler in the crowd, and they retouched his moustache to turn it into

128
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:38,900
 the toothbrush moustache, that Hitler later adopted.

129
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:43,780
 Oh, if only we all had photographers to retouch photos from our youth.

130
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:47,220
 Our parents would be so thrilled to do it.

131
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:52,940
 Well, apart from he kind of retouches them all to make it look like he did when he was older.

132
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:53,940
 It's true.

133
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:55,940
 It's like giving yourself a mullet in a photo from the 80s.

134
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:56,940
 It's really weird.

135
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:57,940
 Yeah.

136
00:06:57,940 --> 00:07:00,780
 But you're always ashamed of how you dress when you're younger, whether it's a weird

137
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:03,460
 bit of moustache, or you've got your stupid long hair from the 70s.

138
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:04,460
 Sorry.

139
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:05,460
 It's not like giving yourself a mullet, isn't it?

140
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:06,460
 No, it's the opposite.

141
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:07,460
 No, it's the opposite.

142
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:08,460
 It's the opposite.

143
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:09,460
 Yeah, it's taking away the mullet.

144
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:10,460
 Yes.

145
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:11,460
 The mullet's embarrassing.

146
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:12,460
 It's like moustache.

147
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:18,300
 It's like the Pope going back to his baby photos and putting a big hat on the mullet.

148
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:20,980
 It's exactly what it's like.

149
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:24,180
 Did you read one of the other amazing pieces of protocol they had to go through that

150
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:30,060
 day when Britain declared war, was that the foreign office sent out loads of telegrams

151
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:33,700
 to all the continents around the world that were vaguely affiliated with warning them were

152
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:34,700
 about to go to war.

153
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:38,700
 So this is sort of in the afternoon going on early evening, all these telegrams were sent

154
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:43,500
 out, and the foreign office clerks had to send them out, and all they had to do was fill

155
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:47,940
 it in a pre-written telegram that said just to warn you, Britain is going to war with

156
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:48,940
 blank.

157
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:52,260
 And they just wrote the word Germany, because they'd had them pre-written for about ten

158
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:53,260
 years.

159
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:54,260
 No, good.

160
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:56,460
 They just knew that they were going to go to war eventually.

161
00:07:56,460 --> 00:08:01,060
 It's like, you know, when you are a kid and you have birthday invites, and it says you

162
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:05,660
 are invited to Blacks Party, like it's exactly like that, is it?

163
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:06,660
 It is.

164
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:09,140
 Do you think some were accidentally they forgot to fill them in and consciously just left

165
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:10,140
 guessing?

166
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:11,140
 Right.

167
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:15,420
 I would have for a laugh put a different country in just one telegram, just so one British

168
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:19,140
 territory overseas thinks we're at war with Switzerland or something.

169
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:20,140
 Yes.

170
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:21,900
 Or do you think they sent it to Germany and it just said you?

171
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:22,900
 Oh, yeah.

172
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:28,180
 Real privilege, the most senior clerk got to do the you one.

173
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:33,020
 I was just reading generally about what happened as soon as war was declared, and obviously

174
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:38,140
 a lot of soldiers had to be conscripted, and that led me into just looking into conscription.

175
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:40,820
 And I read about this thing, which I'd not heard of, I don't know if you guys have, but

176
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:41,820
 the pals of Italian.

177
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:44,020
 Have you heard of that?

178
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:48,460
 This was, so obviously they had to work out what was the best way to get people sort

179
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:50,820
 of passionate about joining the war.

180
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:56,020
 And one of the ideas was the idea that if you signed up with a friend of yours, there

181
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:59,140
 was a promise that you would both be in the same battalion.

182
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:02,740
 So professional golfers were known to sign up with each other.

183
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:07,740
 There was the Grimsby Chums, and that was former schoolboys from wintering him secondary

184
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:08,740
 school and Grimsby Grimsby.

185
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:11,740
 A terrible idea, actually, because if you're going to go to war and have to see all these

186
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:14,300
 people around you dropping dead, I'd rather they weren't all my mates.

187
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:15,300
 I know.

188
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:16,780
 I guess it's a morale thing though up until that point.

189
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:20,500
 Well, the idea is that you might fight harder if it's to save your friends, I think.

190
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:21,500
 Yes, yes.

191
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:28,180
 There was, in Thieves, they had a secret band of an army where they were all lovers, all

192
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:29,260
 gay lovers.

193
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:31,980
 And so they would all be in this army together and they would all fight.

194
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:32,980
 Where was it?

195
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:34,460
 This is in Thieves in the Spartan.

196
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:35,460
 In the Spartan?

197
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:36,460
 Wow, really?

198
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:37,220
 There's not a lot of innovation.

199
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:38,220
 No.

200
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:43,460
 Although actually the war between Sparta and Athens did go on until 1996.

201
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:44,460
 What?

202
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:45,460
 No.

203
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:46,460
 Come on now.

204
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:50,060
 It was one of those ones, you know, where they don't sign their peace agreement.

205
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:51,060
 Yeah.

206
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:55,420
 And so in 1986, they signed a symbolic agreement that Sparta and Athens were no longer at

207
00:09:55,420 --> 00:10:00,900
 war, even though that they'd both been part of modern day Greece for about a thousand years.

208
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:04,260
 So I think we may have briefly mentioned the Barrack upon Tweed thing before.

209
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:06,380
 So there's this, the town of Barrack on Tweed.

210
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:11,780
 They mistakenly believed that they were at war with Russia for about 150 years after

211
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:13,780
 the end of the Crimean War.

212
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:16,060
 So that ended 1856.

213
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:19,940
 And it's because there was this really complicated history with Barrack upon Tweed.

214
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:22,140
 Because it's right on the border of England and Scotland.

215
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:24,820
 And it went, it changed hands about 13 times.

216
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:28,660
 And there was a 1502 agreement between England and Scotland, which said that Barrack upon Tweed

217
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:32,100
 is off, but not within the kingdom of England.

218
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:35,100
 Actually, it had been sorted out in 1746, it was all fine.

219
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:37,700
 If you didn't mention Barrack upon Tweed, there was no problem.

220
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:39,020
 It was still included.

221
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:40,980
 But the town, no one really knew that.

222
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:41,980
 It didn't sort of get through.

223
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:45,620
 So people kept naming it in official documents as a kind of just in case.

224
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:47,620
 They couldn't remember whether it was included.

225
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:53,220
 So people thought that they had been left out and that they were still at war with Russia.

226
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:54,540
 And this is the really sweet thing.

227
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:59,140
 In 2006, there was a kind of exhibition about this in the town, about this interesting,

228
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:00,940
 you know, King of History.

229
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:03,660
 And it was Barrack's war with Russia weekend.

230
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:09,460
 And apparently, as part of it, they had a Wattif reenactment, which I think is the best.

231
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:13,260
 Surely the Wattif in Wattif was Barrack being flattened within 30 seconds.

232
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:17,620
 Russia going about his business.

233
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:20,860
 I was just looking a little bit at the declaration of the Second World War.

234
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:24,540
 And the Second World War was kind of declared by two Nevels.

235
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:25,540
 So it was not really...

236
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:26,540
 Oh, really?

237
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:27,540
 Was it?

238
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:30,580
 It wasn't Gary in film, though.

239
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:32,620
 It was, obviously, there was Chamberlain.

240
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:34,300
 But then there was also Neville Henderson.

241
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:36,420
 He was the British ambassador in Germany.

242
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:39,660
 So it was his job to go and actually tell the Germans that we were at war.

243
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:43,220
 But it might have been because of a mistake, again, a little bit like this era.

244
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:44,460
 In 1914.

245
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:47,060
 So it was August the 30th in 1939.

246
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:52,180
 And Henderson went and met Ribbon Drop, who was their Hitler's prime secretary.

247
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:53,900
 And apparently, things got really tense.

248
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:56,500
 You know, Henderson was saying, "Please stop invading all these countries.

249
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:58,460
 Please don't do the Poland thing."

250
00:11:58,460 --> 00:12:00,060
 And it came really close to blows.

251
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:02,060
 They almost started punching each other.

252
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:05,940
 And then Ribbon Drop said, "Okay, we're going to give you our last offer.

253
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:07,980
 We're going to give Poland the last offer."

254
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:12,380
 And Britain was, obviously, basically represented Poland at this point.

255
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:16,340
 And so Ribbon Drop read over the last offer, but Henderson's really pissed off with Ribbon Drop

256
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:17,340
 at this point.

257
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:18,340
 So he didn't really listen.

258
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:21,220
 And Ribbon Drop read over it really, really fast, sped through it apparently.

259
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:23,740
 And then Henderson went, "Okay, fine, give me the copy."

260
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:26,340
 And Ribbon Drop said, "No, not going to give you the copy.

261
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:28,020
 Hope you were paying attention."

262
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:31,500
 And so Henderson didn't know what had just happened, didn't really know what the offer

263
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:32,500
 was.

264
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:33,980
 It was kind of deliberately convoluted.

265
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:37,140
 And then Ribbon Drop said, "You've got to respond by midnight."

266
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:38,460
 And this confused everything.

267
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:40,740
 And within a couple of days, there was war.

268
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:41,740
 Wow.

269
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:42,740
 Yeah.

270
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:43,740
 So always pay attention.

271
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:44,740
 Yeah.

272
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:46,740
 I don't think that's a message.

273
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:48,740
 So who was Ribbon Drop?

274
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:54,700
 I can see you all switch off, then, and we've gone to war.

275
00:12:54,700 --> 00:13:03,940
 Okay, it is time for fact number two, and that is James.

276
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:09,540
 Okay, my fact this week is that there's a bacterium that can freeze water just by touching

277
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:10,540
 it.

278
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:14,460
 And these bacteria are used to make artificial snow in ski resorts.

279
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:15,460
 That was crazy.

280
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:16,460
 It's amazing.

281
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:17,460
 It's amazing.

282
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:18,460
 It's not fast.

283
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:23,060
 If I dropped one of these bacteria into my glass of water, is it frozen straight away?

284
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:24,060
 No.

285
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:27,260
 So it tends to do it with plants.

286
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:32,180
 It goes into the plant cells and it freezes the water in the plant cells so it can access

287
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:34,620
 the nutrients inside the plants.

288
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:38,260
 But the way that it does it is it has a protein on the outside of the bacterium, and they

289
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:44,620
 can shift the molecules around of the water, and the water then orders it, like, kind of

290
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:48,180
 gets into a lattice into a template, which is what ice is, really.

291
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:51,900
 And then it can also remove heat from the water in the same way that a refrigerator removes

292
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:54,660
 heat from the inside of it.

293
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:59,060
 So it gets hotter, but it removes heat from the water itself to make it into ice.

294
00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:01,060
 And the plants don't like that, presumably.

295
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:04,460
 The plants do not like being killed, no.

296
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:08,700
 There's actually any frost damage that you see is usually down to this bacteria.

297
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:09,700
 Really?

298
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:10,700
 Yeah.

299
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:15,100
 So if you have a plant at, say, minus four degrees minus three or four degrees, it should

300
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:17,700
 be fine because the water inside it can super cool.

301
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:20,140
 It won't turn to ice until a little bit later than that.

302
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:25,100
 But if it has this bacterium in it, then the bacteria will turn the water, which would have

303
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:27,580
 been liquid into ice and it can kill the plants.

304
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:28,580
 Bastard.

305
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:29,580
 Bastard.

306
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:30,580
 Bastard.

307
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:32,540
 What I find is the same, sorry.

308
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:38,860
 What I find amazing is that this is being used in artificial snow making as in you must have

309
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:44,820
 to have so many hundreds and hundreds of millions and billions of these bacteria to make lots

310
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:45,820
 of artificial snow.

311
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:46,820
 How do you breed?

312
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:47,820
 I guess they just, they just reduced.

313
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:48,820
 They just reduced.

314
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:49,820
 They breed so bacteria.

315
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:52,380
 You just leave one alone for 20 hours and then you go back to the beginning.

316
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:53,380
 Well, yeah, that's the thing.

317
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:59,540
 I read a single-cell bacteria in a 12-hour period they can produce 70 billion bacteria

318
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:00,780
 from a single-cell bacteria.

319
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:01,780
 It's a good question.

320
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:02,780
 It breaks that process.

321
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:03,780
 It breaks that process.

322
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:04,780
 So small, isn't it?

323
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:06,940
 Because if they were like human size, overcrowding of the world would have happened in

324
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:07,940
 a second.

325
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:08,940
 Yeah, definitely.

326
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:11,820
 And that, think of all those generations.

327
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:15,380
 That's one great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, grandfather who has

328
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:16,380
 70 billion.

329
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:17,380
 Oh, God.

330
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:18,380
 How do you think you are?

331
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:19,380
 How do you think you are?

332
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:20,380
 How do you think you are?

333
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:21,380
 How do you think you are?

334
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:22,380
 How do you think you are?

335
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:23,380
 How do you think you are?

336
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:24,380
 How do you think you are?

337
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:25,380
 How do you think you are?

338
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:26,380
 How do you think you are?

339
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:27,380
 How do you think you are?

340
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:28,380
 How do you think you are?

341
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:29,380
 They can do it even after they're dead.

342
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:30,380
 Wow.

343
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:34,900
 Like snowmacks who make this artificial snow, they get dead bacteria, because the bacteria

344
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:39,700
 still have the protein on their outside, which can make the water turn into ice, even though

345
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:40,700
 they're not alive anymore.

346
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:41,700
 Wow.

347
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:47,860
 It's not a great PR line though, is it, using the dead corpses of billions of bacteria?

348
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:52,580
 Well, the thing is, real rain probably has these guys in it as well.

349
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:58,220
 So most real rain or snow has to have some kind of nucleus, which the water goes around.

350
00:15:58,220 --> 00:16:02,180
 And they think that, generally speaking, it's this particular bacteria that's most common

351
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:03,740
 in rain around the world.

352
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:04,740
 Really?

353
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:08,660
 Because all rain starts sort of frozen up there, but then how is the bacteria not able

354
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:12,140
 to freeze it as well once it's in rain form down with us?

355
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:14,300
 Yes, because there'll be two warm at that stage.

356
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:16,820
 The bacteria only really works around the zero mark.

357
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:17,820
 Got it.

358
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:19,420
 And the things are kind of freezing anyway, but you know.

359
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:25,620
 That's why you don't get many ski slopes in places like Barbados, because the bacteria

360
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:26,620
 can't do it in the heat.

361
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:28,900
 Have you guys heard of the British gut project?

362
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:29,900
 No.

363
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:34,340
 So I was looking at microbiomes and how there's a theory that your bacteria in your stomach

364
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:35,340
 can affect your mood.

365
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:40,540
 So they don't experiments on mice where mice with no microbes in them got twice as stressed

366
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:43,860
 when scientists freak them out as normal mice did with normal microbiomes.

367
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:45,620
 So there's a theory there.

368
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:50,900
 But the British gut project is this enterprise which is trying to map the whole gut microbiome

369
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:52,740
 of the British population.

370
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:56,420
 And they're basically crowdsourcing poo in the post.

371
00:16:56,420 --> 00:16:57,420
 In the post?

372
00:16:57,420 --> 00:16:58,420
 Yeah.

373
00:16:58,420 --> 00:16:59,660
 But you do have to pay.

374
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:01,140
 You can't just send them poo in the post.

375
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:02,140
 So there's crowd.

376
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:05,260
 How much do I have to pay to put poo in the post?

377
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:11,380
 It's 75 quid, but they are trying to build up this whole picture of the nation's microbiome

378
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:12,380
 health.

379
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:14,220
 They've been done it, tried in America already.

380
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:18,300
 And it's really interesting seeing a whole population's general health.

381
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:19,900
 So they're trying to sequence the DNA.

382
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:22,020
 So they will send you a breakdown of your own DNA.

383
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:25,660
 But it's not going to be a good method to find out the population's health because you're

384
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:29,100
 only going to get the weirdos, you're willing to shit in an envelope and send it to your

385
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:30,100
 solitus.

386
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:34,860
 I can't help but say, if you're upset with the British gut project, how do you show your

387
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:35,860
 displeasure?

388
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:37,060
 Because you can't send it anywhere in the post.

389
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:40,660
 You send them an empty sample part of the poll and poo.

390
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:41,660
 Wow.

391
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:44,660
 We're sending them your poo though, because half imagine getting a thing about going, you're

392
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:45,660
 50% corn.

393
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:50,780
 You know, just anything that's, I don't think that's how sequencing DNA will help.

394
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:59,340
 You know when they say that humans and cons, like 75% of the DNA is those guys.

395
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:02,740
 In China, it's smuggy, I read.

396
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:08,140
 And there are bacteria that live on the smug, so they live inside the smug and they can

397
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:09,140
 eat the smug.

398
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:12,860
 And that sounds like quite cool, doesn't it, because maybe it gets rid of the smug.

399
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:18,500
 But unfortunately, they fart out even worse chemicals.

400
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,660
 So you're just replacing one police with another.

401
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:23,580
 Do we not have another kind of bacteria that can eat the worst chemicals?

402
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:26,220
 I get the feeling that they'll fart something worse after that.

403
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:27,820
 That's really fun.

404
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:37,140
 OK, it's time for fact number three, and that is Chazinsky.

405
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:41,980
 My fight is that women who were applying to be Qing Dynasty concubines had to spend a

406
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:46,220
 night sleeping with the Emperor's mother first, so that she could check they didn't

407
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:47,220
 snore.

408
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:54,060
 Yeah, so the selection process to be a concubine was so arduous, and there were so many steps

409
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:55,060
 to it.

410
00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:58,580
 This is actually in this amazing thing that's on the south, it's been published by the South

411
00:18:58,580 --> 00:19:02,780
 China Morning Post, but it's in collaboration with the Forbidden Palace Museum, and I would

412
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:03,780
 so recommend it.

413
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:07,580
 They've done a series of chapters detailing life in the Forbidden City.

414
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:11,140
 And this is about, yeah, so there were these concubines who lived in the Forbidden City with

415
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:12,340
 the Emperor.

416
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:17,860
 And to become one, you had to, well, first of all, every single Manchu woman in the kingdom

417
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:22,380
 had to apply to become a concubine, so you weren't allowed to marry until you'd applied

418
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:24,420
 to check the Emperor didn't want to marry you.

419
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:29,500
 This was all girls between 13 and 16, and they did this sort of call out every three years.

420
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:33,060
 And then they'd come, and God knows how they whittled it down from that many, but they

421
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:37,060
 whittled it down to about a hundred who would be monitored really, really carefully by

422
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:39,580
 all these females already in the Forbidden City.

423
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:46,260
 So for things like in squid, skin abnormalities, body odor, they were really strict on body

424
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:49,300
 odor, and anything else that might be wrong with them.

425
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:52,660
 And then they were whittled down to finalists who were kind of taught like a finishing school

426
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:53,660
 how to behave.

427
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:54,660
 It's very much like the X-Factor, isn't it?

428
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:55,660
 It is.

429
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:56,660
 It's so X-Factor.

430
00:19:56,660 --> 00:19:57,660
 Yeah.

431
00:19:57,660 --> 00:19:58,660
 Although they don't do the body odor thing.

432
00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:04,140
 The X-Factor spend a night sleeping next to Simon Carroll.

433
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:06,420
 But I know how they whittled it down.

434
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:08,740
 It was in that brilliant piece.

435
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:10,300
 So when the Ming dynasty--

436
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:11,460
 Which is the one just before?

437
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:12,460
 Yes.

438
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:13,940
 We've got records of how they whittled it down.

439
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:18,860
 So they picked 5,000 young women, and then they eliminated 1,000 on the first day for being

440
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:20,860
 too short or tall or fat or thin.

441
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:25,460
 And the second day, they got rid of another 2,000 based on their voices and general manner.

442
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:26,460
 You got 2,000 left.

443
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:28,820
 Well, that is actually like X-Factor, isn't it?

444
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:29,820
 Yeah.

445
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:30,820
 It's true.

446
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:34,260
 And third day, they got rid of another 1,000 because their hands or feet weren't right.

447
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:35,260
 I haven't seen--

448
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:38,420
 I haven't seen the X-Factor, but I don't think that that fades in.

449
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:39,500
 So you've got 1,000 left.

450
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:40,500
 Yeah, foot inspection.

451
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:41,780
 Foot inspection was a massive thing.

452
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:42,780
 Yeah.

453
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:43,780
 Feet are so important.

454
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:44,780
 Feet are so important.

455
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:45,780
 Yeah.

456
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:46,780
 Then you've got 1,000 left.

457
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:48,780
 And then you have gynecological examinations, which apparently get rid of another 700.

458
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:49,780
 Wow.

459
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:50,780
 I do not know how.

460
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:55,380
 I've got to say, I kind of at this stage wish I'd been kicked out for being too tall short

461
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:57,380
 fat or thin.

462
00:20:57,380 --> 00:21:00,020
 And then you have a month of testing for the remaining 300.

463
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:01,020
 Yeah.

464
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:04,980
 But in that final month, is it right that they get taught sort of incredible skills that

465
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:08,700
 they might not have learnt painting, reading, walking.

466
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:09,700
 Yeah.

467
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:10,700
 It was very much my fault.

468
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:12,220
 What kind of walking walking walk?

469
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:17,140
 One of those skills that you'd never learned, unless you were in Alice, who walked back into

470
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:18,220
 your village, you've changed.

471
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:21,420
 [LAUGHTER]

472
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:23,420
 Everyone else were rolling around.

473
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:24,420
 [LAUGHTER]

474
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:25,900
 Oh, she thinks she's so off herself.

475
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:27,420
 [LAUGHTER]

476
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:30,660
 That was a book that was saying they were taught to have.

477
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:33,540
 They had to have dainty feet, and they were taught to have a titillating walk.

478
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:34,540
 Yeah.

479
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:40,780
 But yeah, and sleeping next to the mother, the mother was the final herd, or you had to cross,

480
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:42,300
 and she was the senior woman.

481
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:43,300
 [LAUGHTER]

482
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:44,300
 What a boss level.

483
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:45,300
 [LAUGHTER]

484
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:48,580
 How many, do you know, got through to that final phase?

485
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:52,980
 I think the finalists, they were 10, I think, or maybe they were 5 at that point, but we were

486
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:53,980
 down to a manageable number.

487
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:57,780
 Because the mother doesn't have, you know, there's only one Emperor's mum, so she can't

488
00:21:57,780 --> 00:22:02,060
 spend all her time unless she sleeps with them all at the same time, but then how do you

489
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:03,060
 know who's sorry?

490
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:04,060
 Yeah.

491
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:05,060
 Oh, yes.

492
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:06,780
 You just blame it on the person next to you.

493
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:09,420
 And it was to check for things like sleepwalking or sleep talking.

494
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:12,540
 All body odors again, she had to be very careful with.

495
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:13,540
 And then you passed.

496
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:16,940
 But a lot of girls in one part, obviously, because it meant that you had to abandon your village

497
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:20,820
 and your family and all your friends and live forever in this massive urban city with

498
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:21,820
 this creepy old man.

499
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:22,820
 So.

500
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:23,820
 Yeah.

501
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:27,060
 You might not come and see you, though, because when the lots of concubines, some of them

502
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:28,060
 had tons, didn't they?

503
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:29,060
 I think.

504
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:30,060
 Yeah, you had different levels.

505
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:33,860
 You had your base level concubine, and then it went to higher rankings all the way up to

506
00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:35,540
 your, the Empress boss level.

507
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:36,540
 Yeah.

508
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:37,540
 Exactly.

509
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:39,340
 And there were about 20,000 by the chain dynasty.

510
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:40,340
 20,000 concubines.

511
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:42,140
 Concubines, consorts.

512
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:43,140
 Yeah.

513
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:44,140
 Blimey.

514
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:45,140
 Where would it be?

515
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:46,140
 20,000 women in this urban city.

516
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:47,140
 I have some women.

517
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:50,340
 I'm just trying to work out the timings of this.

518
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:51,340
 What?

519
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:52,340
 How?

520
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:55,940
 How, like, let's say, how many, how many you can have sex with in that amount of time?

521
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:56,940
 Got us.

522
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:57,940
 Yeah.

523
00:22:57,940 --> 00:22:58,940
 You know, to be frank.

524
00:22:58,940 --> 00:22:59,940
 Well, they did have problems with that.

525
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:05,940
 It was one emperor called Emperor Wu, not part of the Qing, but he had 5,000 women, too many

526
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:11,220
 to either remember who he actually wanted to sleep with, but he knew that they were all

527
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:12,220
 very pretty.

528
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:15,700
 So what he used to do was go around in a cart that was carried by goats.

529
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:19,620
 And when the goats got tired, wherever they parked, that's who he went and had sex with

530
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:20,620
 that night.

531
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:21,620
 Yeah.

532
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:22,620
 That's...

533
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:24,660
 Surely there's an easier way to remember who you fancy.

534
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:25,860
 He fancied them all, I think.

535
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:26,860
 That's the idea.

536
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:29,300
 As the concubines, he just thought they're all very beautiful.

537
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:31,980
 So wherever the goats stop, that's where I'll get off.

538
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:35,980
 And some of the concubines he had cheated.

539
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:40,220
 And many of the concubines actually did want to have relations with him because maybe it

540
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:42,500
 brought children and they would become emperors.

541
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:43,500
 Exactly.

542
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:47,420
 So what they used to do was leave little bits of treats outside the door for the goats to

543
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:50,860
 trick them into stopping.

544
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:55,220
 And then there's other ones who, because they wanted to make sure that there was not too

545
00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:59,220
 much jealousy amongst the concubines, because if you slept with one of the concubines,

546
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:04,300
 that raised her level and suddenly your surrounding concubines might get a bit too jealous and fights

547
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:09,460
 break out and so on, they used to have a rotation calendar that was done for certain emperors.

548
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:13,460
 So they would make sure that you never slept with the same concubine in the same week or something

549
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:14,460
 like that.

550
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:15,460
 Sure, right.

551
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:16,460
 And we'd have written records of that.

552
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:20,660
 So I read on this website, Anna, that you were talking about, that in the 10th century

553
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:25,420
 calendars, we used to keep track of the sex life rather than of dates of day life.

554
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:26,420
 Yes.

555
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:27,420
 It was so closely monitored.

556
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:34,820
 You're not saying I'll meet you on the 29th of the Emperor's Shagging Rachel.

557
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:38,980
 And I think we should bring it back in our royal family.

558
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:45,060
 Yeah, there was a branch of the Imperial Government that was set up in the 1670s called the

559
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:47,060
 Office of Respectful Service.

560
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:51,700
 And this was to formalise that really and make sure secretaries were installed to keep tabs

561
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:53,900
 on the sexual activities.

562
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:57,580
 And so every single concubine that visited the bedroom, they'd have to take note of it,

563
00:24:57,580 --> 00:25:00,220
 they'd have to find out what actually happened in there.

564
00:25:00,220 --> 00:25:04,020
 Because again, the ranking system, you haven't had any much.

565
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:05,860
 I found this interesting.

566
00:25:05,860 --> 00:25:11,020
 Apparently there was only one monogamous Chinese emperor who was called Hong Xi.

567
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:14,100
 And he was only monogamous because he was extremely close to his mother.

568
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:16,300
 And then his mother was murdered by a concubine.

569
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:18,700
 So that rather put him off the idea of concubines.

570
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:19,700
 Or concubines.

571
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:20,700
 Yeah.

572
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:21,980
 Except the one, presumably.

573
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:23,980
 I think he took a wife.

574
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:24,980
 He took a wife.

575
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:25,980
 Yeah.

576
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:26,980
 They could do that sometimes.

577
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:27,980
 Couldn't they concubines?

578
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:31,900
 There was an emperor called Xi-A-Sing, which I'm sure I'm pronouncing wrong.

579
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:36,100
 But 18 of his concubines kind of ganged up on him and tried to kill him.

580
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:40,860
 They drove herpins into his crotch and they wrapped a silk cord around his neck and tried

581
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:41,860
 to strangle him.

582
00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:42,860
 Wow.

583
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:51,580
 The guy with the clipboard in the corner saying, "I don't know what I record this at."

584
00:25:51,580 --> 00:25:53,580
 Maybe heavy pressing?

585
00:25:53,580 --> 00:25:58,940
 Well, the Empress, emphrasifying, then had all the conspirators killed.

586
00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:00,700
 They're all executed.

587
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:07,460
 But Xi-A-Sing, he decided to move out of the Imperial Palace and became a Taoist magician

588
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:12,780
 who spent his whole life having sex with virgins and drinking magic potions made from bodily

589
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:13,780
 fluids.

590
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:14,780
 Wow.

591
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:15,780
 He infected him quite badly.

592
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:16,780
 It's, yeah.

593
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:17,780
 Is that...

594
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:18,780
 And that council is being a magician?

595
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:22,940
 It's only been disappointed if I went to a magic show and all he did was drink blood and urine

596
00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:24,940
 and have sex with virgins.

597
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:29,180
 You've clearly never been to a day of a blind track.

598
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:31,020
 I think the magic was other stuff.

599
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:32,020
 Right.

600
00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:33,820
 Did he stay as emperor?

601
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:37,120
 He did, but basically he just ignored all of his duties that he was supposed to do as

602
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:38,120
 emperor.

603
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:39,120
 Wow.

604
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:40,120
 And did all this magic and...

605
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:41,120
 I'm so annoying.

606
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:42,120
 I'm so annoying.

607
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:45,260
 If the Empress had got a magic show, he'd be constantly trying to show you another trick.

608
00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:52,260
 I'm saying that we are at war with four separate groups of people, could we have some decisions,

609
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:53,260
 please?

610
00:26:53,260 --> 00:26:55,460
 Oh, pick a card.

611
00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:59,340
 Just on Unix, so because they were the other group of people that were allowed in the

612
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:03,420
 Forbidden City, you couldn't have men with their parts because then they might impregnate

613
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:04,420
 the women.

614
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:08,500
 So there were thousands and thousands of Unix and it was actually a good gig because it's

615
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:12,460
 the only way you can work really close to the emperor in his government.

616
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:15,580
 But I think there was one drawback.

617
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:19,540
 The application process was a bit tedious.

618
00:27:19,540 --> 00:27:26,660
 Imagine if they chop your cock off and then they said, "Sorry, you snore."

619
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:31,660
 But the way they did it was they put you on a chair with a hole in the seat.

620
00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:32,660
 Oh, really?

621
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:36,300
 And then you just whip something underneath it and it's gone.

622
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:38,300
 I mean, it was the testicles that were really...

623
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:39,300
 It was the piece of hole.

624
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:40,300
 It was the piece of hole.

625
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:41,300
 Yes, yeah.

626
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:42,300
 You got to get rid of it.

627
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:45,660
 And I think we've said they used to then have to carry them around in a pouch we've mentioned

628
00:27:45,660 --> 00:27:46,660
 before.

629
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:51,420
 Which they were proud of, the last Unix of China, fell out with his family when they threw

630
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:52,740
 his genitals away.

631
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:55,220
 The Unix never spoke to his family again off the back.

632
00:27:55,220 --> 00:27:56,220
 I think that's fair enough.

633
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:59,300
 I would be so annoyed if my mum threw away a body part of mine.

634
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:00,300
 Yes.

635
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:02,580
 Your car is on or off.

636
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:06,820
 When you go back to visit your parents and they've like changed your bedroom and they turn

637
00:28:06,820 --> 00:28:07,820
 into a study or something.

638
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:08,820
 Yeah.

639
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:09,820
 That's really upsetting.

640
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:10,820
 Yeah, that's true.

641
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:15,540
 So the reason they threw it away is because during the cultural revolution there was a whole

642
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:19,780
 thing about you need to discard anything that was seen as old society.

643
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:23,860
 And if you had anything that was old society, yeah, you put your whole family at risk because

644
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:25,580
 you own something from...

645
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:28,580
 So they saw his genitals as part of that tradition.

646
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:29,580
 Oh my goodness.

647
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:30,580
 Yeah, so they threw it away.

648
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:31,580
 That's amazing.

649
00:28:31,580 --> 00:28:32,580
 And think about his life.

650
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:33,580
 This guy, Sonia Teng, the last Unix.

651
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:34,580
 He died in 1996.

652
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:35,580
 Yeah.

653
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:36,580
 Wow.

654
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:37,580
 Really recent history.

655
00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:38,580
 Yeah.

656
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:43,500
 I don't know how you pronounce that word, but Conky Binage, Conky Binage, was only banned

657
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:44,820
 in Hong Kong in 1972.

658
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:45,820
 Wow.

659
00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:46,820
 Yeah.

660
00:28:46,820 --> 00:28:48,580
 And it's still not uncommon, I think.

661
00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:52,500
 It's not as frowned upon to have lots of mistresses in our parts of China.

662
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:56,940
 And there's a saying in China, well, someone who's Chinese on the internet said, "We've got

663
00:28:56,940 --> 00:29:00,820
 a popular saying," which explains why Chinese men need multiple women.

664
00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:03,860
 But women are expected to just have one man.

665
00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:07,540
 And it goes, "One teapot is usually accompanied by four cups.

666
00:29:07,540 --> 00:29:10,980
 Have you ever seen one cup with four teapots?"

667
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:14,540
 Sounds similar to something I have seen on the internet, but...

668
00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:15,540
 Oh!

669
00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:19,500
 Two conkybings, one cup, so I can't say that.

670
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:23,780
 Completely different, but equally profound meaning to that.

671
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:27,740
 Conkybinging sounds like an old, old Netflix kind of.

672
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:28,980
 It's not conkybinging.

673
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:32,140
 Conkybinging just sounds like you're chucking them out.

674
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:37,500
 Oh, well, there is a good argument for conkybinging because there's a new TV show in China

675
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:42,140
 which is about Yangtze Palace, and it's hugely popular.

676
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:46,860
 It's the most Googled TV show of the year 2018, despite the fact that Google is largely banned

677
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:47,860
 in China.

678
00:29:47,860 --> 00:29:51,860
 That's how hugely popular it is, all across Asia, lots of other countries as well.

679
00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:58,580
 It's been streamed 15 billion times, and it's about a rivalry between conkybines in the

680
00:29:58,580 --> 00:29:59,580
 forbidden city.

681
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:02,940
 So conkybinging is actually a perfect word for watching the show.

682
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:06,700
 15 billion, that means everyone on average has watched it twice.

683
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:07,700
 I know.

684
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:08,700
 That's...

685
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:09,700
 Yeah.

686
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:10,700
 I'm just saying it's a lot.

687
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:11,700
 It's a lot.

688
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:15,780
 But I guess there are billions of people who haven't seen it, so someone's watched at least

689
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:16,780
 three times.

690
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:17,780
 Yeah.

691
00:30:17,780 --> 00:30:20,020
 I've watched it two million times.

692
00:30:20,020 --> 00:30:23,140
 I think there are just a billion people in Asia.

693
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:25,140
 A billion people in China, aren't there?

694
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:26,140
 Yeah, one point three.

695
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:27,140
 Yeah.

696
00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:28,140
 And more outside that.

697
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:29,140
 But still within Asia.

698
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:30,140
 Yeah.

699
00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:32,140
 Asia's population is very high.

700
00:30:32,140 --> 00:30:33,140
 I know.

701
00:30:33,140 --> 00:30:38,180
 I shouldn't have been surprised that 15 billion is a lot.

702
00:30:38,180 --> 00:30:39,180
 I mean, how many people live in Asia?

703
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:40,180
 Is it about four billion?

704
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:41,180
 It's a very large population.

705
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:42,180
 All of Asia.

706
00:30:42,180 --> 00:30:43,180
 They include in India.

707
00:30:43,180 --> 00:30:44,180
 Oh, no.

708
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:45,180
 Cheating.

709
00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:46,180
 Oh, I'm including India.

710
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:47,180
 Oh, right.

711
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:48,180
 Then five.

712
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:49,180
 Yeah.

713
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:53,380
 One point three billion in China, one point three billion in India, probably about one hundred

714
00:30:53,380 --> 00:30:55,180
 million in Bangladesh or something.

715
00:30:55,180 --> 00:30:56,180
 Right.

716
00:30:56,180 --> 00:30:57,180
 Indonesia.

717
00:30:57,180 --> 00:30:58,180
 It's not a biggie.

718
00:30:58,180 --> 00:30:59,180
 But they've still all seen it more than twice.

719
00:30:59,180 --> 00:31:00,180
 That's the amazing thing.

720
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:01,180
 Even all of these people, you know.

721
00:31:01,180 --> 00:31:03,180
 How do they get anything done?

722
00:31:03,180 --> 00:31:04,180
 Well, there's China so productive.

723
00:31:04,180 --> 00:31:07,180
 They're all constantly watching this thing.

724
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:11,180
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

725
00:31:11,180 --> 00:31:12,180
 OK.

726
00:31:12,180 --> 00:31:14,180
 It's time for our final fact of the show.

727
00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:15,180
 And that is my fact.

728
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:21,940
 My fact this week is that some meteors skim off the earth as if they were a stone skimming

729
00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:23,940
 across the waters.

730
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:24,940
 That's very good.

731
00:31:24,940 --> 00:31:25,940
 But who is throwing them?

732
00:31:25,940 --> 00:31:26,940
 Yes, good question.

733
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:27,940
 It's so profound.

734
00:31:27,940 --> 00:31:28,940
 I know.

735
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:29,940
 I've made that a bit more poetic.

736
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:33,220
 Probably scientists listening are thinking, you dick, that's not what they do.

737
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:37,140
 So, but they don't skim off the earth if you count the earth as the ground that we walk

738
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:38,140
 on, do they?

739
00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:39,140
 No.

740
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:40,140
 Exactly.

741
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:41,140
 That would be the best fact we've ever done.

742
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:42,140
 [LAUGHTER]

743
00:31:42,140 --> 00:31:43,140
 If no one knew that.

744
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:44,140
 What this is, is--

745
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:46,140
 [LAUGHTER]

746
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:47,140
 This is meteors.

747
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:50,080
 Too much of it if the betrayal that came to kill the dinosaurs just went, "Why are you

748
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:51,080
 on your own?"

749
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:52,080
 [LAUGHTER]

750
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:53,080
 Straight back into space.

751
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:55,080
 That would be extraordinary.

752
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:59,520
 What this is is, we obviously-- we have an atmosphere and the atmosphere is what

753
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:00,520
 burns up.

754
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:04,280
 When we call a meteorite, it's because it goes through a layer of the atmosphere.

755
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:07,920
 It's very cold, burns it up, and then that lands on the earth.

756
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:12,120
 Sometimes, when a meteor comes into the earth's atmosphere, it's on such an angle, almost

757
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:16,840
 a parallel angle to the earth's atmosphere, that it just bounces off.

758
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:18,080
 They're called earth grazers.

759
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:19,960
 They don't make it down further.

760
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:24,440
 They literally get a lift, a boost off the atmosphere, pushing it back up.

761
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:28,080
 Sometimes slowing at speed, but it makes it back out and just hurdles back into space.

762
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:31,880
 Latch it if you could skim it off the earth and then off Mars and then off the earth.

763
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:32,880
 [LAUGHTER]

764
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:35,120
 Wouldn't that be extraordinary?

765
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:38,720
 We know that it happens a lot, and a lot of people have seen it with the naked eye, but

766
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:41,320
 we haven't actually recorded too many of these.

767
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:46,200
 I believe in 2006 was only the fourth time that we've ever caught in camera, what is known

768
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:49,000
 as the earth grazers, the ones that come in and skim off.

769
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,680
 So what does it look when you sit with the naked eye?

770
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:54,160
 Does it look like a meteor, but it just does burn up?

771
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:59,560
 No, it does burn up, so you see the flaming meteorites as it were coming in, but because

772
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:02,600
 of the angle, it suddenly just takes a turn and heads off.

773
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:04,640
 But do you see it take a turn then with the naked eye?

774
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:08,000
 Well, I guess what you see is the flame go out.

775
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:12,600
 You just see, yeah, you see it's drinking across the sky and then kind of finishing.

776
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:17,360
 Is it right to say then that it comes in and it goes very slightly into the earth's atmosphere

777
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:20,960
 and then bounces out again, so when it's in the earth's atmosphere, that's when it's

778
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:23,440
 burning up and that's what you see, but then it disappears.

779
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:24,440
 Exactly.

780
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:29,640
 So in 2006, there was one, it was just, it was a bright fireball is what you would have seen

781
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:36,680
 in the sky and this was seen over Japan and it made it to 55 miles from the earth's surface.

782
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:37,680
 Wow.

783
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:38,680
 So that gets really close.

784
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:40,920
 And then it just looked down and thought no.

785
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:41,920
 Right, man.

786
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:42,920
 These guys look lame.

787
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:48,680
 Yeah, so it was, it was there for 35 seconds that you could see it and yeah, so and then

788
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:53,420
 it just disappears back out into, back into space and in the distance, it's crazy.

789
00:33:53,420 --> 00:33:58,260
 This is actually related to that or not about meteors, but with spaceships, that same effect

790
00:33:58,260 --> 00:34:02,140
 is a major concern they have when bringing spaceships back to earth.

791
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:05,860
 So one of the hardest things if you're controlling a spaceship is re-entering because you have

792
00:34:05,860 --> 00:34:09,680
 to get the angle at which you re-enter completely spot on.

793
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:14,220
 And if you go to sharpen angle, then you're going to fast and there's too much friction

794
00:34:14,220 --> 00:34:18,320
 and then you burn up, but if you're going to shallow an angle, if it is really shallow,

795
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:22,700
 then again, there's this risk because the earth is a sphere that you'll sort of skim

796
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:25,380
 across the atmosphere, but then come back off of it.

797
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:26,380
 And miss it.

798
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:27,380
 Yeah, miss the earth.

799
00:34:27,380 --> 00:34:30,320
 You'd have thought it was a big enough target.

800
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:34,460
 So one of the biggest problems with Apollo 13 as they came around from the other side of

801
00:34:34,460 --> 00:34:39,060
 the moon was on top of everything else is that because their instruments were down, that

802
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:40,500
 exact thing was going to happen to them.

803
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:43,420
 They were not on the right trajectory to come back into earth.

804
00:34:43,420 --> 00:34:48,420
 So they had to make a thrust, basically with the naked eye, with the earth in the distance

805
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:54,360
 using that as a target to get themself back into the right position, otherwise that might

806
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:55,360
 have happened to them.

807
00:34:55,360 --> 00:35:00,300
 Although, I've read a few things, and maybe James, you know about this, about things wouldn't

808
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:01,780
 really bounce off the earth.

809
00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:03,420
 You don't just bounce off into the distance.

810
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:04,420
 No, of course not.

811
00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:09,780
 So there's no spring that you can hit, there's no solidity in the earth, but it's just the

812
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:11,500
 fact that the earth is circular.

813
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:13,940
 So the earth was flat, which some people argue.

814
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:24,300
 Here we go.

815
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:28,300
 It's just that it can't get through those dense layers, so it effectively goes straight.

816
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:31,540
 But because the earth is a curve, then it comes straight off it again.

817
00:35:31,540 --> 00:35:35,500
 There's another kind of quite cool earth grazing thing that you can watch.

818
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:37,660
 A few people have been lucky to see it.

819
00:35:37,660 --> 00:35:39,540
 It's called a meteor procession.

820
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:40,540
 This is really cool.

821
00:35:40,540 --> 00:35:45,100
 When it does come into that zone of the atmosphere, where it starts heating up, often a meteor will

822
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:46,820
 break into little bits.

823
00:35:46,820 --> 00:35:50,060
 And that's sometimes when we see meteor showers and so on.

824
00:35:50,060 --> 00:35:51,060
 It's why you see so many.

825
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:55,460
 So what will happen is this meteor will come in, it'll start breaking up into bits, but still

826
00:35:55,460 --> 00:35:59,860
 enough of it is there to head back out into space and not come down.

827
00:35:59,860 --> 00:36:04,140
 However, it will now be about 10 of them that will fly back off into space.

828
00:36:04,140 --> 00:36:07,620
 So you'll just see what looks like because they're all on the same trajectory, just like

829
00:36:07,620 --> 00:36:11,860
 an Arab show, a procession going over you, flying over it by flaming balls.

830
00:36:11,860 --> 00:36:12,860
 Yeah.

831
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:15,460
 It's kind of like a meteor shower in a way, which is always fun.

832
00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:18,860
 And I didn't realise that I think this is going to be one of those things that I, it's

833
00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:19,860
 unbelievable.

834
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:20,860
 I didn't know.

835
00:36:20,860 --> 00:36:24,620
 But I didn't know that meteor showers happened, so regularly, like at the same time, every

836
00:36:24,620 --> 00:36:28,460
 single year, and that they're all named after the constellation they come from, which is

837
00:36:28,460 --> 00:36:29,460
 nice.

838
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:31,620
 So you've got Orionids or Geminiids.

839
00:36:31,620 --> 00:36:36,380
 And they're at 112 meteor showers every year, always happen at the same time, because

840
00:36:36,380 --> 00:36:38,980
 it's where the earth just intersects with the comet tail at the same time.

841
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:43,780
 And I guess over many thousands of years, then it changes, as the comet moves away.

842
00:36:43,780 --> 00:36:44,780
 Yeah.

843
00:36:44,780 --> 00:36:45,780
 I didn't really know that.

844
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:48,300
 How do you say, is it the perseid, or the perseid?

845
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:52,460
 So the perseid meteor shower that people might have seen, that is cool.

846
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:54,620
 I just quite like this origin of what it's called.

847
00:36:54,620 --> 00:36:57,700
 It's usually referred to as the tears of St. Lawrence.

848
00:36:57,700 --> 00:37:02,780
 And that is after St. Lawrence, who is that Christian Deacon, who the Romans burnt him

849
00:37:02,780 --> 00:37:09,300
 in AD258, and he's the one who, you know, they put him on a barbecue, roasted on a barbecue.

850
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:13,540
 And then he, apparently, according to legend, was the guy that said, "I am already roasted

851
00:37:13,540 --> 00:37:14,540
 on one side.

852
00:37:14,540 --> 00:37:18,540
 If you would have me well cooked, it is time to turn me on to the other."

853
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:19,540
 It's such a great story.

854
00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:20,540
 It's so lovely.

855
00:37:20,540 --> 00:37:21,540
 It's so lovely.

856
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:24,260
 So what you actually said, was that?

857
00:37:24,260 --> 00:37:26,780
 Well, that was that in Latin.

858
00:37:26,780 --> 00:37:30,260
 I've got a religious connection to all this, too.

859
00:37:30,260 --> 00:37:32,220
 So there is an argument.

860
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:35,140
 It's only an argument, and we'll never know the truth, but there's an argument that.

861
00:37:35,140 --> 00:37:38,100
 There's a bit in the Bible where St. Paul has a conversion.

862
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:39,900
 He's on the road to Damascus.

863
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:41,860
 He's called something else before that, and then he becomes Paul.

864
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:42,860
 It's called Saul.

865
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:43,860
 He's called Saul.

866
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:45,420
 And Saul becomes Paul.

867
00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:50,060
 So there is an argument that he just saw a meteor, because in the account, there are several

868
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:51,060
 different accounts of it.

869
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:52,700
 He sees a big flash, I think.

870
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:53,700
 Exactly.

871
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:54,700
 He says it's brighter than the sun.

872
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:56,220
 It can be brighter than the sun.

873
00:37:56,220 --> 00:37:57,220
 He fell over.

874
00:37:57,220 --> 00:37:58,220
 Take.

875
00:37:58,220 --> 00:37:59,220
 That would happen.

876
00:37:59,220 --> 00:38:00,220
 Why?

877
00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:01,980
 It's a shockwave if a meteor arrives.

878
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:02,980
 Oh.

879
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:03,980
 Take.

880
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:04,980
 Really?

881
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:05,980
 He also says he heard a big noise.

882
00:38:05,980 --> 00:38:06,980
 Take.

883
00:38:06,980 --> 00:38:08,980
 And he was blinded, which could happen.

884
00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:09,980
 Well, but do you know that?

885
00:38:09,980 --> 00:38:11,980
 That also could be a truck.

886
00:38:11,980 --> 00:38:12,980
 Couldn't it?

887
00:38:12,980 --> 00:38:13,980
 No, I don't think it lights.

888
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:14,980
 I don't think it lights.

889
00:38:14,980 --> 00:38:15,980
 Yeah.

890
00:38:15,980 --> 00:38:16,980
 Paul's over.

891
00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:17,980
 Take.

892
00:38:17,980 --> 00:38:18,980
 Loud noise.

893
00:38:18,980 --> 00:38:19,980
 Take.

894
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:20,980
 That's true.

895
00:38:20,980 --> 00:38:22,980
 And it would have been more miraculous in a way to produce a truck at that time.

896
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:27,820
 Hey, just speaking of that idea you said of, it's not as crazy as a meteorite hitting the

897
00:38:27,820 --> 00:38:30,300
 Earth's surface itself and bouncing off.

898
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:31,300
 Oh, yeah.

899
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:40,740
 There is a Mars, 2.5 million years ago, a rock left the surface of Mars, shot out into space,

900
00:38:40,740 --> 00:38:48,740
 then in 1962, that rock finally landed on Earth as a meteorite in Nigeria, in Zagami.

901
00:38:48,740 --> 00:38:51,860
 And it's known as the Zagami meteorite.

902
00:38:51,860 --> 00:38:56,740
 And sometimes soon in the future, that very same bit of meteorite is going to become a meteorite

903
00:38:56,740 --> 00:38:59,820
 again, except this time, back on Mars.

904
00:38:59,820 --> 00:39:04,740
 Because in 1996, we put some of that meteorite back onto a ship.

905
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:07,260
 So we've relaunched it out of our planet.

906
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:11,220
 And it's part of the Mars Global Survey, which has been going around Mars, but we've lost

907
00:39:11,220 --> 00:39:12,380
 contact with.

908
00:39:12,380 --> 00:39:16,620
 So very soon that satellite is going to go into, it's going to be sucked in by the orbit

909
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:17,620
 of Mars.

910
00:39:17,620 --> 00:39:18,620
 It's going to be so pissed off.

911
00:39:18,620 --> 00:39:22,540
 In that, if you're like, I've traveled for 2.5 million years to get away from that place

912
00:39:22,540 --> 00:39:24,500
 and you've literally just put me straight back.

913
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:25,500
 That's true.

914
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:26,500
 That's incredible, though.

915
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:30,820
 It's like a cool poetic justice, isn't it?

916
00:39:30,820 --> 00:39:34,700
 I think it's amazing how these rocks get from one place to another.

917
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:41,780
 Like for instance, when the dinosaur asteroid came down, it breaks through the atmosphere,

918
00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:44,860
 basically pushes all the atmosphere out of the way, causes a vacuum.

919
00:39:44,860 --> 00:39:48,620
 And so when it hits the ground, the loads of rocks come up, they all get sucked into space.

920
00:39:48,620 --> 00:39:49,620
 Oh wow.

921
00:39:49,620 --> 00:39:54,540
 And so you could theoretically have some rocks from the dinosaur age that have since made

922
00:39:54,540 --> 00:39:59,020
 it onto the moon, and they could theoretically be dinosaur fossils, obviously.

923
00:39:59,020 --> 00:40:02,460
 In fit, like probably not, but theoretically it could be.

924
00:40:02,460 --> 00:40:08,060
 There was an article about this recently, there's a piece of rock that they think maybe

925
00:40:08,060 --> 00:40:10,460
 it's from Earth, but they can't, they need to do more tests.

926
00:40:10,460 --> 00:40:14,820
 In fact, that one you are talking about, I think they do, like you say, they're not sharp,

927
00:40:14,820 --> 00:40:18,700
 but they're pretty sure it is from the Earth, because it was the way you can tell it how

928
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:22,100
 it was formed, and it was formed in a way that either it's from the Earth or they have

929
00:40:22,100 --> 00:40:25,100
 to change the way that the history of the moon is.

930
00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:28,580
 Right, because they think it couldn't have come up to the surface of the moon in the right

931
00:40:28,580 --> 00:40:29,580
 times.

932
00:40:29,580 --> 00:40:34,100
 It's a bit complicated, but yeah, that could be the oldest known Earth rock, and they found

933
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:35,100
 it on the moon.

934
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:41,860
 It's about 4 billion years old, it's incredible, is it because they brought it back to it?

935
00:40:41,860 --> 00:40:42,860
 They must have done that.

936
00:40:42,860 --> 00:40:44,180
 Yeah, it came on Apollo 14, I think.

937
00:40:44,180 --> 00:40:46,180
 What are the odds of bringing back?

938
00:40:46,180 --> 00:40:48,380
 Did you come back with some moon samples?

939
00:40:48,380 --> 00:40:49,380
 We've got some bad news.

940
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:50,380
 We feel so stupid.

941
00:40:50,380 --> 00:40:55,020
 Probably that spaceship crossed with the Martian one and the two rocks waved at each other

942
00:40:55,020 --> 00:40:56,860
 going, "Go back home, yeah, go back home."

943
00:40:56,860 --> 00:41:00,860
 Why have we got such strict immigration laws in the universe when we keep on sending

944
00:41:00,860 --> 00:41:02,860
 fun rocks back when they came through?

945
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:07,300
 No wonder conspiracy theorists don't think we went, the only rocks we've got are fucking

946
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:10,300
 from here anyway.

947
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:12,500
 Can I just say one thing about just about the Tunguska?

948
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:17,260
 So the Tunguska event was this massive explosion, we'll see in 1908, it was so big, it

949
00:41:17,260 --> 00:41:22,820
 cast light over the whole world and at the time the night, the night skies glowed so brightly

950
00:41:22,820 --> 00:41:29,460
 that people in Asia, which we know is heavily populated, so probably quite a lot of people,

951
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:34,700
 people in Asia read their newspapers outdoors at midnight and apparently at least one golfer

952
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:39,380
 got in a round at 2.30 in the morning in St Andrews and Scotland.

953
00:41:39,380 --> 00:41:40,380
 That's amazing.

954
00:41:40,380 --> 00:41:41,380
 That's you.

955
00:41:41,380 --> 00:41:42,380
 That's the 1908 version of you, James.

956
00:41:42,380 --> 00:41:48,580
 Does it look like the world's ending here, wow, I think I could get diving in there.

957
00:41:48,580 --> 00:41:54,660
 So a meteor, heading towards the earth, if it's a small-ish size, we would call that, let's

958
00:41:54,660 --> 00:41:58,820
 say a meteor, a meteoroid meteorite in the earth, if it was bigger, it's an asteroid, right?

959
00:41:58,820 --> 00:42:00,620
 So it's a sightseeing.

960
00:42:00,620 --> 00:42:05,460
 So in movies, whenever we try to prevent an asteroid from hitting the earth, they always

961
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:10,740
 send up some kind of big nuclear device to blow it up and there's so many plans going

962
00:42:10,740 --> 00:42:15,780
 on with NASA and independent bodies of scientists who are trying to work out the best way to stop

963
00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:18,220
 potential asteroids from hitting the earth.

964
00:42:18,220 --> 00:42:22,100
 And there's something that want to wrap it in a sail and sort of sail it in a different

965
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:23,100
 direction.

966
00:42:23,100 --> 00:42:27,380
 But one thing I read is they don't ever really want to go for the nuclear option because

967
00:42:27,380 --> 00:42:31,300
 obviously you blow it up and then suddenly you're sending a lot of rocks to earth.

968
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:36,580
 But what I didn't realize is they're nuclear rocks now, so you've made them radioactive.

969
00:42:36,580 --> 00:42:42,060
 So you would actually just make the whole situation doubly worse by spreading radiation everywhere

970
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:43,060
 where it hit.

971
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:46,580
 I mean, we have this ridiculous policy where we can't bring a strand of hair into space

972
00:42:46,580 --> 00:42:51,500
 in case it infects Mars and I can't believe that I'm considering sending radioactive rocks

973
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:52,500
 out into space.

974
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:53,500
 Yeah.

975
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:54,980
 I think the key would be to push it, wouldn't it?

976
00:42:54,980 --> 00:42:58,700
 That's the current best theory because there's a guy at NASA who's called the planetary

977
00:42:58,700 --> 00:43:00,020
 protection officer.

978
00:43:00,020 --> 00:43:04,940
 He's an awesome guy, but he's very low-key about the whole thing, so his name is Lindley

979
00:43:04,940 --> 00:43:09,140
 Johnson, and he's responsible for it basically, but he's only got eight members of staff.

980
00:43:09,140 --> 00:43:12,100
 So if we get hit by an asteroid, is it his fault?

981
00:43:12,100 --> 00:43:13,100
 Effectively.

982
00:43:13,100 --> 00:43:17,740
 But he was asked about it, he said, "Do you feel a little pressure being the planetary protection

983
00:43:17,740 --> 00:43:18,740
 officer?"

984
00:43:18,740 --> 00:43:20,780
 And he said, "It doesn't stress me out that much."

985
00:43:20,780 --> 00:43:27,140
 Well, I want someone to be a bit more, but actually, because who does he answer to if we

986
00:43:27,140 --> 00:43:29,940
 do get all annihilated by an asteroid?

987
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:36,940
 Well, he's going to go into the cockroach's office and cockroach will say, "Well done."

988
00:43:36,940 --> 00:43:44,500
 You've been working for us all this time.

989
00:43:44,500 --> 00:43:45,500
 Okay, that is it.

990
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:46,500
 That is all of our facts.

991
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:47,980
 Thank you so much for listening.

992
00:43:47,980 --> 00:43:51,220

 We're going to be touring all around the UK in March.

1002
00:44:13,060 --> 00:44:14,740
 We're going to Ireland as well.

1003

 We'll be back again next week with another episode.

1006
00:44:19,620 --> 00:44:20,620
 We'll see you then.

1007
