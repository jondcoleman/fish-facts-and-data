00:00:10,00:00:15,"Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish,"
00:00:15,00:00:19,a weekly podcast this week coming to you live from Gothenburg!
00:00:19,00:00:22,[cheering]
00:00:22,00:00:24,My name is Dan Schreiber.
00:00:24,00:00:29,"I am sitting here with Anna Tyshinski, Andrew Hunter Murray and James Harkin,"
00:00:29,00:00:32,and once again we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts
00:00:32,00:00:38,"from the last seven days and in no particular order, here we go!"
00:00:38,00:00:42,"Starting with fact number one, and that is Andy."
00:00:42,00:00:47,"My fact is that the novel Dune, one of the greatest sci-fi novels ever,"
00:00:47,00:00:54,was rejected 20 times before being printed by a publisher who specialised in car repair manuals.
00:00:54,00:00:55,[laughter]
00:00:55,00:01:02,"Because this is the book festival here in Gothenburg, one of the themes this year is space,"
00:01:02,00:01:04,this is about a book about space.
00:01:04,00:01:08,"Take it into consideration that we only have an hour, can you explain what Dune is?"
00:01:08,00:01:10,"Oh, it's so great."
00:01:10,00:01:14,"It's a sci-fi novel, it's set on the desert planet of Arrakis,"
00:01:14,00:01:18,"and it's all about the rise of a young messiah, or is he?"
00:01:18,00:01:23,"Paula Trady's, and of course there's the Harkinen family, and there are giant worms,"
00:01:23,00:01:28,"and it's a fantastic work of 60s sci-fi, you know."
00:01:28,00:01:29,"Frank Herbert, right?"
00:01:29,00:01:34,"Frank Herbert was the author, and it had been serialised in a magazine, but it's really long,"
00:01:34,00:01:38,"I mean it's really long Dune, and it was way too long to be a book, according to most publishers,"
00:01:38,00:01:43,"you've got to look at it, and no one wanted to print it even in three volumes, they just said no thanks."
00:01:43,00:01:48,"So he got lots of rejections, and then he met a guy called Sterling E. Lanier of Chilton Books,"
00:01:48,00:01:52,"and they specialised in car repair manuals, and they had some magazines as well,"
00:01:52,00:01:57,"like Jeweler's Circular, and Dry Good's Economist, so..."
00:01:57,00:02:02,"Is that like just a Good's Economist magazine, but it's very dry?"
00:02:02,00:02:03,It's very dry.
00:02:03,00:02:06,No jokes in there at all.
00:02:06,00:02:09,"And they had done some sci-fi books before, it wasn't their first, some sources online"
00:02:09,00:02:12,"say it's the first time they did, they had a little line in sci-fi."
00:02:12,00:02:16,"They've recently kind of bought another publisher, hadn't they, called Greenberg Publisher,"
00:02:16,00:02:22,"and Greenberg was a sci-fi publisher, and that had been started by a guy called Martin Greenberg,"
00:02:22,00:02:26,who was also the first publisher of Isaac Kassimov's Foundation Trilogy.
00:02:26,00:02:29,So they did have a little bit of background on that.
00:02:29,00:02:33,"But it wasn't a success, even with that little bit of effect around it."
00:02:33,00:02:37,"Sales were so bad that Lanier was sacked a year later, so for all the publishing people"
00:02:37,00:02:41,"who are in the room today, don't take risks, is the message."
00:02:41,00:02:45,"I remember when you read this book Andy, because you did it on a no such thing as a fish tour"
00:02:45,00:02:49,"when we went to Australia, and Andy's one of those people when he starts a book he needs to finish it,"
00:02:49,00:02:53,"and this book has what, like six appendix, appendices, appendices at the end."
00:02:53,00:02:57,"I used to be sat next to Andy on the plane, and it's a long flight to Australia,"
00:02:57,00:03:01,"and I got zero chat from him, he was the most dull man on tour."
00:03:01,00:03:06,"Those were the days, weren't they, when Andy didn't talk to us."
00:03:06,00:03:10,"I've actually started reading it this week, and I've got 40 pages in,"
00:03:10,00:03:15,"and I'll be honest, I am one of those people that doesn't have to finish every book that I read."
00:03:15,00:03:19,Would you say it's more or less exciting than a car repair manual?
00:03:19,00:03:25,"Oh that's interesting, because I've never read a car repair manual, even though I've owned many cars."
00:03:25,00:03:27,"Right, yeah, fair enough. Do you know, James, you'll hate this."
00:03:27,00:03:34,"James has a big fear of mushrooms, but there is an origin story to this whole June saga,"
00:03:34,00:03:41,"which is that Frank Herbert loved studying fungi, and it was mushrooms that inspired him to do June."
00:03:41,00:03:46,"This is according to a book called Mycelium Running, the author of Paul Stamets sat down with him,"
00:03:46,00:03:51,"and he basically said ""The Magic Spice"", which is in the book."
00:03:51,00:03:53,So that's like the drug that they're all going through there.
00:03:53,00:03:57,"Exactly, that's the spores of the mushroom, the bending of space and time."
00:03:57,00:04:02,"That's him tripping on mushrooms, psychedelia, that's when he was off his tits."
00:04:02,00:04:09,"The giant worms, those are magics digesting the mushrooms that he would have witnessed in the process of studying them."
00:04:09,00:04:11,So it's basically a tribute to the mushroom.
00:04:11,00:04:15,"And also he made huge contributions to the world of mushrooms, didn't he, Frank Herbert?"
00:04:15,00:04:16,What?
00:04:16,00:04:20,"As well as writing apparently unsuccessful book at the time,"
00:04:20,00:04:25,"he apparently, and this is according to Paul Stamets, and who was really good mates with him from the 80s,"
00:04:25,00:04:29,he said that Frank was this avid mushroom collector and he got really upset when he would have to throw away
00:04:29,00:04:32,less than perfect wild chanterelles.
00:04:32,00:04:37,"So instead he mixed it with water and salt and made a big slurry paste,"
00:04:37,00:04:43,and he spread it around the bottom of new fir trees and then a load of chanterelle mushrooms grew there.
00:04:43,00:04:50,"And this may not sound exciting at all to anyone here or me, but to mushroom people, to mycologists,"
00:04:50,00:04:52,they had no idea that mushrooms could grow at the base of young trees.
00:04:52,00:04:58,"So he discovered that by placing a slurry of old mushrooms at the bottom of a young tree,"
00:04:58,00:05:00,you could make some new mushrooms.
00:05:00,00:05:04,"Wow, that does sound like an important contribution to me."
00:05:04,00:05:06,"Yeah, yeah, and more important than June, maybe?"
00:05:06,00:05:07,"Yeah, definitely."
00:05:07,00:05:10,"Wow, 40 pages in, I would say yes."
00:05:10,00:05:13,"Well, 900 pages in, I can tell you."
00:05:13,00:05:19,"And the other cool thing about Dune, so it's set on a deserty planet, it's all very, very sandy,"
00:05:19,00:05:25,"and he was inspired to write this in part by some real life dunes, so you can visit."
00:05:25,00:05:30,"I think, in fact, they run tourist visits to the dunes of Florence, Oregon,"
00:05:30,00:05:34,and they were threatening to overrun the city in the early 20th century.
00:05:34,00:05:36,"Yeah, he hated these sand dunes, didn't he?"
00:05:36,00:05:40,"Well, the sand dunes were widely hated because they were encroaching on the city, they'd move,"
00:05:40,00:05:45,"and he was researching a program by the U.S. Department of Agriculture,"
00:05:45,00:05:50,"and they were fixing huge grasses into these dunes to stabilize them, European beach grass,"
00:05:50,00:05:53,"it's called, and it's got very deep roots, it locks the dunes in place."
00:05:53,00:05:58,And the plot of Dune is about this desert planet and how it can be turned green again.
00:05:58,00:06:01,"It's exactly, and over the course of the novels, slight spoiler,"
00:06:01,00:06:05,"the planet goes from desert to green, and then back to desert,"
00:06:05,00:06:09,"and guess what's happening in the desert now in Florence, Oregon?"
00:06:09,00:06:11,Giant worms?
00:06:11,00:06:13,No.
00:06:13,00:06:15,"They are now trying to get rid of these grasses,"
00:06:15,00:06:18,"which they introduced as an invasive species a hundred years ago,"
00:06:18,00:06:20,because they're messing up with the ecology of the region.
00:06:20,00:06:23,"So, wow, the same thing is happening all over again."
00:06:23,00:06:25,"It's a premonition book, basically."
00:06:25,00:06:26,"Kind of, yeah."
00:06:26,00:06:29,"Gops, you're telling me humans introduced a new species to try and fix stuff,"
00:06:29,00:06:32,and it actually went even more wrong than it was before.
00:06:32,00:06:35,That astonishes me.
00:06:35,00:06:38,"It's amazing, how many copies did you say, Andy?"
00:06:38,00:06:42,"So, it's like 14 million, 20 million, it's a big, big, big seller, right?"
00:06:42,00:06:43,It's had a huge cultural impact.
00:06:43,00:06:47,I was trying to find out a few things of where it's led into pop culture and so on.
00:06:47,00:06:53,"There's a great story that Iron Maiden, the band, they named a song Dune,"
00:06:53,00:06:55,"and it was inspired entirely by the book,"
00:06:55,00:06:59,"but they had to ask, or they wanted to ask, permission from Frank Herbert"
00:06:59,00:07:01,"to say, ""Would you give us your blessing?"""
00:07:01,00:07:04,"And they got a statement back from him, a little message that said,"
00:07:04,00:07:09,"""Frank Herbert doesn't like rock bands, particularly heavy rock bands,"
00:07:09,00:07:12,"and especially bands like Iron Maiden."""
00:07:12,00:07:18,"And so they had to change it to the titles now, ""To Tame a Land,"" if anyone knows that song."
00:07:18,00:07:20,"Well, can I tell you, I am an Iron Maiden anecdote."
00:07:20,00:07:24,"Me and Anna once went to a pub quiz with Bruce Dickinson from Iron Maiden,"
00:07:24,00:07:26,he's the lead singer.
00:07:26,00:07:27,And we sat with him through the whole quiz.
00:07:27,00:07:29,"We did the quiz, I think we won the quiz, in fact."
00:07:29,00:07:32,And Anna was sat with Bruce the whole night and chatting to him or whatever.
00:07:32,00:07:35,"And the next morning I said, ""What did you think?"
00:07:35,00:07:36,"Bruce is a nice guy, right?"""
00:07:36,00:07:37,"And Anna said, ""Oh, yeah."""
00:07:37,00:07:40,"Said, ""Have you not heard of Iron Maiden?"""
00:07:40,00:07:42,"And she said, ""Oh, I thought that was a made-up band."""
00:07:42,00:07:51,"I thought that Iron Maiden only existed in that song that goes,"
00:07:51,00:07:55,"""Listen to Iron Maiden, baby."""
00:07:55,00:07:57,Teenage shirt band.
00:07:57,00:07:58,Yeah.
00:07:58,00:08:01,"I thought Teenage Dark like the song, ""Invented Iron Maiden."""
00:08:01,00:08:03,"It was astonishing, my love, that I did a pub quiz with him."
00:08:03,00:08:04,Amazing.
00:08:04,00:08:04,Yeah.
00:08:04,00:08:05,Wow.
00:08:05,00:08:06,Wow.
00:08:06,00:08:08,"Frank Herbert had some gigs before his June breakthrough,"
00:08:08,00:08:10,and he was a wine critic for a while.
00:08:10,00:08:11,What's that you see?
00:08:11,00:08:15,"And he was a very, very assiduous, whatever he did, he was very devoted."
00:08:15,00:08:18,"I think this is why June is 19 million pages long,"
00:08:18,00:08:20,it's because he really researches everything.
00:08:20,00:08:21,So it was a wine critic.
00:08:21,00:08:24,"He not only insisted on being trained up on knowledge of all wine,"
00:08:24,00:08:27,"he insisted on being trained to make wine himself,"
00:08:27,00:08:30,"which actually is quite suspicious and is what I would insist on as well,"
00:08:30,00:08:31,by being a wine critic.
00:08:31,00:08:33,"But yeah, and he was a wine critic,"
00:08:33,00:08:37,"and then he was a speech writer for a Republican senator,"
00:08:37,00:08:40,"who I tried to find, he was called Guy Corden."
00:08:40,00:08:44,"It was in 1955, and I did a troll of the newspaper archives"
00:08:44,00:08:50,looking for Guy Corden's name being paired with worms or mushrooms or space.
00:08:50,00:08:50,Nothing.
00:08:50,00:08:51,"Nothing, nothing."
00:08:51,00:08:55,"He was very anti-Soviet, wasn't he?"
00:08:55,00:08:58,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, he was part of that kind of McCarthyism"
00:08:58,00:09:00,where they're trying to root out all the commies.
00:09:00,00:09:02,I think he was a distant cousin of Joseph McCarthy.
00:09:02,00:09:04,"That is Herbert was, yeah."
00:09:04,00:09:05,"Exactly, yeah, yeah."
00:09:05,00:09:06,Was he?
00:09:06,00:09:07,"Yeah, he was."
00:09:07,00:09:10,"And you see that, I think, in some of the novels, don't you?"
00:09:10,00:09:15,"There's kind of an anti-communist angle to it, I believe so, yeah."
00:09:15,00:09:20,"So, and the movies, obviously, we've all watched the June movies."
00:09:20,00:09:22,I watched the David Lynch one this week.
00:09:22,00:09:23,The big one.
00:09:23,00:09:24,The big one.
00:09:24,00:09:25,"That was, like, 1984."
00:09:25,00:09:29,"Yeah, so there's the massive ones that have been coming out in the last year or two."
00:09:29,00:09:32,"By 1984, David Lynch shot a version."
00:09:32,00:09:35,"And it's weird, I would say."
00:09:35,00:09:38,That's so odd for David Lynch.
00:09:38,00:09:43,"But weirdly, it's just not quite weird enough to be David Lynch."
00:09:43,00:09:48,So it's like in that uncanny valley of not being weird enough to be weird.
00:09:48,00:09:49,"It's really, really strange."
00:09:49,00:09:51,But they filmed it in Mexico.
00:09:51,00:09:55,And it was in an area where they had lots of rocks and plants and stuff like that.
00:09:55,00:09:59,"But they needed it to be like June, where none of these things existed."
00:09:59,00:10:05,"So apparently they spent two months stripping all of the plants, all of the animals in this area,"
00:10:05,00:10:06,so they would look like June.
00:10:06,00:10:07,Oh my God.
00:10:07,00:10:11,"Why don't you just go to Namibia or somewhere, which has vast rolling sand?"
00:10:11,00:10:13,Probably a tax thing.
00:10:13,00:10:13,Tax thing.
00:10:13,00:10:18,"Yeah, so some very famous names in the movie, Sting the Musicians in it."
00:10:18,00:10:21,And one other person who's in it is Patrick Stewart of Star Trek.
00:10:21,00:10:22,It's so weird.
00:10:22,00:10:22,"Yeah, right."
00:10:22,00:10:27,"Honestly, like you watch it and suddenly Captain whatever's called comes in."
00:10:27,00:10:29,But you know what's even weirder about that?
00:10:29,00:10:30,This is why it's so weird.
00:10:30,00:10:32,David Lynch hired Patrick Stewart.
00:10:32,00:10:36,"And then when Patrick Stewart showed up, he went, this is the wrong Patrick Stewart."
00:10:36,00:10:38,He got the wrong card.
00:10:38,00:10:40,"Patrick Stewart, Captain Picard, was never meant to be in it."
00:10:40,00:10:42,There's another actor called Patrick Stewart.
00:10:42,00:10:44,And it went to the wrong person.
00:10:44,00:10:45,But was he already a sci-fi...
00:10:45,00:10:47,He was already doing stuff.
00:10:47,00:10:48,"No, I don't think so at that point."
00:10:48,00:10:49,"No, he was like a theatre guy."
00:10:49,00:10:51,"Yeah, he was a theatre guy."
00:10:51,00:10:55,"And so then he got on to the set and did exactly what you did with Bruce Dickinson,"
00:10:55,00:10:58,which is he was introduced to Sting and had no idea who he was.
00:10:58,00:11:00,Because I do what else do you do?
00:11:00,00:11:01,"And he's like, oh, I'm a musician."
00:11:01,00:11:03,"He's like, oh, that's really cool."
00:11:03,00:11:03,I'll check your stuff out.
00:11:03,00:11:05,That's exciting.
00:11:05,00:11:06,What's it called?
00:11:06,00:11:08,"And he's like, we're the police."
00:11:08,00:11:09,"And he thought, oh, that's really nice."
00:11:09,00:11:13,An armed service to put together a band.
00:11:13,00:11:15,And you probably play fairs and stuff.
00:11:15,00:11:16,"Yeah, that's so good."
00:11:17,00:11:18,This first film that was released.
00:11:18,00:11:21,"So you saw it last night, though?"
00:11:21,00:11:21,"Yes, I did, yeah."
00:11:21,00:11:25,"Was it easy to follow, hard to follow, somewhere between...?"
00:11:25,00:11:26,"It was hard to follow, I'll be honest."
00:11:26,00:11:31,"It's quite baffling, because they try and crowbar a big book into a sort of longish film."
00:11:31,00:11:32,But that's a real squeeze.
00:11:32,00:11:35,"It is such a complicated film to watch, supposedly,"
00:11:35,00:11:40,"that when the first film came out, audiences in cinemas were given a small printed glossary of"
00:11:40,00:11:44,terms to help them understand what was going on.
00:11:44,00:11:46,"I could really have done with that, I'll be honest."
00:11:47,00:11:48,I've seen an original copy of these things.
00:11:48,00:11:50,"The typeface is so small, but in a dark cinema,"
00:11:50,00:11:54,"you would be looking for ages for the term ""Muadib"" or whatever it is."
00:11:54,00:11:55,Yeah.
00:11:55,00:11:57,"And by the time you look back, it would be another scene."
00:11:57,00:11:59,It just seemed like a terrible idea.
00:11:59,00:12:01,I think they put the lights on before.
00:12:01,00:12:04,"And when everyone had a quick read, familiarize yourselves with what's coming up."
00:12:04,00:12:05,"What, memorize the glossary?"
00:12:05,00:12:08,"Well, just get a brief idea."
00:12:08,00:12:12,"So we've got the modern Dune movies, and then there was the David Lynch in 1984."
00:12:12,00:12:15,"But there was meant to be another one in 1974,"
00:12:15,00:12:19,which was going to be directed by a guy called Alejandro Jodorowsky.
00:12:19,00:12:23,"And he basically said, ""I want to make the full version of this."""
00:12:23,00:12:26,So it was going to be a 10 to 14 hour long movie.
00:12:26,00:12:28,He had an extraordinary cast lined up.
00:12:28,00:12:34,"Everyone from Orson Welles, David Carradine, who was Kill Bill, Geraldine Chaplin."
00:12:34,00:12:38,"Orson Welles, he managed to convince to come onto the film by saying,"
00:12:38,00:12:41,"""I will pay you really well, but also I'll get your favorite gourmet chef"
00:12:41,00:12:42,"to prepare your meals every single day."""
00:12:42,00:12:43,"And he was like, ""Great, I'm in."""
00:12:43,00:12:45,"Yeah, that works."
00:12:45,00:12:46,But it never happened.
00:12:46,00:12:50,And he had a bit of a fallout with Frank Herbert over the writing process of it.
00:12:50,00:12:55,"But this director believed that he didn't need to talk to Herbert,"
00:12:55,00:12:58,because Herbert had extracted the novel initially
00:12:58,00:13:01,from the collected unconscious of our world.
00:13:01,00:13:04,And so it was plucked from some soup of ideas.
00:13:04,00:13:09,"That's a good anti-copyright argument, isn't it, when you're taken to court?"
00:13:09,00:13:11,"Well, it was all lingering in the air."
00:13:11,00:13:13,It was an enormous kind of behemoth of a thing.
00:13:13,00:13:16,"And unsprising, it never got made."
00:13:16,00:13:18,But he hired Salvador Dali to be in it.
00:13:18,00:13:21,And Dali insisted on only being in this film
00:13:21,00:13:23,if he could become the highest-paid Hollywood actor ever.
00:13:23,00:13:26,I think he must have been doing the whole thing as a joke.
00:13:26,00:13:28,"But so Frank Herbert agreed and said,"
00:13:28,00:13:34,"""Fine, I will pay you $100,000 an hour in this film I'm doing."""
00:13:34,00:13:38,And then he reduced Dali's scenes so that he only needed him for an hour.
00:13:38,00:13:40,And he set up the rest with a robotic...
00:13:40,00:13:41,It says a robot look-alike.
00:13:41,00:13:43,"Now, a robotic look-alike."
00:13:43,00:13:45,"I don't know if that means a look-alike to Dali,"
00:13:45,00:13:47,"who was also kind of a robotic actor,"
00:13:47,00:13:50,or if they actually got a robot who looked like Dali to do the rest.
00:13:50,00:13:53,"In those days, that's just going to be a microwave of the mustache, isn't it?"
00:13:53,00:14:04,"I need to move us on, guys."
00:14:04,00:14:08,"It is time for fact number two, and that is James."
00:14:08,00:14:12,"Okay, my fact this week is that the largest known star"
00:14:12,00:14:15,"is 3,000 times wider than the sun,"
00:14:15,00:14:18,"and is coincidentally called ""WOW!"""
00:14:18,00:14:29,"Yes, so this is WOHG64, which I am choosing to pronounce ""WOW!"""
00:14:29,00:14:34,And it actually gets its name because it was discovered by astronomers
00:14:34,00:14:38,"Bent Vesteland, Niels Olander, and Larga Heddon,"
00:14:38,00:14:40,"who I think might be Swedish, actually."
00:14:40,00:14:43,They're certainly from this part of the world.
00:14:43,00:14:46,"And the first letter of each of the names is WOH,"
00:14:46,00:14:47,and that's how it gets its name.
00:14:47,00:14:50,"It actually, it kind of works if you mix it up, like, ""HOW!"""
00:14:50,00:14:54,"For the size of ""OWW!"""
00:14:54,00:15:01,"Yeah, this is amazing."
00:15:01,00:15:02,"So, yeah, and it's a massive old star."
00:15:03,00:15:08,"It's, if you can imagine the sun as a tiny grain of sand,"
00:15:08,00:15:12,then this star is about the size of a basketball.
00:15:12,00:15:13,What?
00:15:13,00:15:13,"No, ""WOW!"""
00:15:13,00:15:18,I walk into the curry.
00:15:18,00:15:23,And it's kind of interesting because it's much cooler than you would imagine.
00:15:23,00:15:24,"I mean, it's cooler in that way,"
00:15:24,00:15:27,"but cooler, as in it's not very hot,"
00:15:27,00:15:29,than you would expect from this kind of star.
00:15:29,00:15:31,"We don't really know why,"
00:15:31,00:15:35,and it's kind of an variance with the current theories of how stars are made.
00:15:35,00:15:37,"So that, for scientists,"
00:15:37,00:15:39,"we find that really, really interesting"
00:15:39,00:15:42,when something doesn't quite fit in with our rules.
00:15:42,00:15:45,Something else is going on that we can discover.
00:15:45,00:15:47,It's one of those things like the mushrooms at the bottom of the tree.
00:15:47,00:15:48,"You know, it's really, really exciting"
00:15:48,00:15:50,for the people who know about how stars are made.
00:15:50,00:15:53,"And then for a lot of us, it's like, ""Okay, good on you."""
00:15:53,00:15:55,"Another point of analogy with it,"
00:15:55,00:15:57,"if it was placed where our sun is,"
00:15:57,00:16:00,we would all be inside it now.
00:16:00,00:16:02,"It will come out as far as Jupiter, in fact."
00:16:02,00:16:05,"It will come out way, way, way, way, way further than the Earth at the moment."
00:16:05,00:16:06,"But if it's not that hot, sounds like we'll be fine."
00:16:06,00:16:10,Just a nice warmth.
00:16:10,00:16:11,"Yeah, exactly."
00:16:11,00:16:15,I like that the instrument that we use largely to observe it
00:16:15,00:16:17,is called the Very Large Telescope.
00:16:17,00:16:19,"Yes, science is great."
00:16:19,00:16:22,"Isn't it? Because we've got an extremely large telescope, haven't we?"
00:16:22,00:16:26,And I think there's one bigger than that.
00:16:26,00:16:27,"I'm working on, I can't remember what it is,"
00:16:27,00:16:29,it's not the enormously large telescope.
00:16:29,00:16:31,"Oh, it's the Very Hungry Telescope, that's it."
00:16:31,00:16:36,"The Very Large Telescope, it's a parameter that they're using to view..."
00:16:36,00:16:37,Whoa.
00:16:37,00:16:40,It's strong enough that it would be able to make out a tennis ball
00:16:40,00:16:43,that is on the Opera House in Oslo from this room.
00:16:43,00:16:46,"But that's how, yeah, how good they are."
00:16:46,00:16:47,"Well, that puts it in context for me."
00:16:47,00:16:52,I was hoping for the people of Gothenburg
00:16:52,00:16:54,that they might know where Oslo is.
00:16:54,00:16:56,I couldn't even point to Oslo from here.
00:16:56,00:16:59,"So, yeah, that is amazing."
00:16:59,00:17:02,"What's, and that's the, did you say interferometer?"
00:17:02,00:17:03,"It's an interferometer, yeah."
00:17:03,00:17:04,I'd never heard of that.
00:17:04,00:17:05,"Well, let's move up."
00:17:05,00:17:11,"Have you guys, do you know what the name of the most distant planet"
00:17:11,00:17:14,that we have found in the far reaches of the Solar System is called?
00:17:14,00:17:15,"No, no."
00:17:15,00:17:17,It's called Far Out.
00:17:17,00:17:17,Hang on.
00:17:17,00:17:18,"Oh, really?"
00:17:18,00:17:20,"It's called Far Out, or at least it was."
00:17:20,00:17:22,It was only the record holder for two months
00:17:22,00:17:23,"before they found something even further,"
00:17:23,00:17:25,which they called Far Far Out.
00:17:25,00:17:28,Very cool names.
00:17:29,00:17:33,"But some suns, or some stars, sorry, are actually really not that hot."
00:17:33,00:17:36,I get quite excited when you learn about stuff in the universe
00:17:36,00:17:39,that you can sort of imagine making contact with.
00:17:39,00:17:42,"Like, in fact, I was saying to James earlier"
00:17:42,00:17:44,"that there's a fact I read once that is,"
00:17:44,00:17:48,"if you fell into a black hole that's a thousand times bigger than the sun,"
00:17:48,00:17:49,theoretically you would survive.
00:17:49,00:17:51,"Now, obviously, you wouldn't for lots of reasons,"
00:17:51,00:17:53,but it wouldn't crush you theoretically.
00:17:53,00:17:55,"And I just liked that because it's like,"
00:17:55,00:17:58,"wow, me, a tiny human on Earth could survive that."
00:17:58,00:17:59,And I was amazed to read equally
00:17:59,00:18:01,"that there are these things called brown dwarfs,"
00:18:01,00:18:04,"which are, they're often called failed stars."
00:18:04,00:18:07,So they're stars that they're not big enough
00:18:07,00:18:09,to sustain nuclear fusion at their core.
00:18:09,00:18:11,"But their surface temperatures are so low,"
00:18:11,00:18:13,some of them are as low as about like a mug of tea.
00:18:13,00:18:17,"So if you touched it, it would feel like it's a hand warmer."
00:18:17,00:18:18,That's cool.
00:18:18,00:18:19,"Yeah, it's not crazy."
00:18:19,00:18:21,"They can get hot, though, mugs of tea, can't they?"
00:18:21,00:18:25,"Yeah, this is like a mug of tea when you've left it too long."
00:18:25,00:18:25,"Oh, really?"
00:18:25,00:18:27,"A mug of tea when you sip it and you go,"
00:18:27,00:18:28,"oh, bollocks, you have to chuck it away."
00:18:28,00:18:33,"You know, those kind of failed stars,"
00:18:33,00:18:36,"if they had a bit more mass, they would become stars, right?"
00:18:36,00:18:40,"And the level that you have to get to to become a star,"
00:18:40,00:18:42,"that area is called the genes instability,"
00:18:42,00:18:46,which I think sounds like something a bit rude in your trousers.
00:18:46,00:18:51,"Oh, got a bit of a genes instability going on."
00:18:51,00:18:51,Don't mind me.
00:18:55,00:18:58,There are some stars on there which are kind of rogue loose stars.
00:18:58,00:18:59,"Oh, yeah."
00:18:59,00:19:00,They're hyper dense.
00:19:00,00:19:02,"They're about the size of our sun,"
00:19:02,00:19:05,"but they many, many, many thousands of times the mass."
00:19:05,00:19:07,And they're just barreling loose through space.
00:19:07,00:19:07,Wow.
00:19:07,00:19:09,As in they're not in a proper system.
00:19:09,00:19:10,"Oh, that's amazing."
00:19:10,00:19:11,Rebels.
00:19:11,00:19:11,Like they are.
00:19:11,00:19:16,"Like her in Street Fighter, like one of those Ryu balls."
00:19:16,00:19:17,What?
00:19:17,00:19:18,"You know, I told you."
00:19:18,00:19:21,"I didn't, again, I've said it before and I'll say it again."
00:19:21,00:19:26,I don't think it needed that layer of really nice analogy on top.
00:19:26,00:19:28,"It's just like some paint pictures, Andy."
00:19:28,00:19:31,"But it is, it's just like those."
00:19:31,00:19:34,It's a random loose fireball just barreling through.
00:19:34,00:19:36,"And I don't, there's never been one."
00:19:36,00:19:38,I think there's end of our solar system or anything like that.
00:19:38,00:19:39,Okay.
00:19:39,00:19:41,"But if one does come this way, we're knackered."
00:19:41,00:19:41,"Oh, yes."
00:19:41,00:19:42,"Yeah, yeah."
00:19:42,00:19:45,"Well, what's quite sweet about stars is,"
00:19:45,00:19:47,"aside from these sort of Clint Eastwood loner stars,"
00:19:47,00:19:53,they're basically all or I think estimated 85% of them come in pairs.
00:19:53,00:19:54,And I actually find it amazing.
00:19:54,00:19:58,"If you're looking at the sky and you see a star, it's probably two stars."
00:19:58,00:20:00,"And if you look through a really powerful telescope, you'll see two."
00:20:00,00:20:04,"So yeah, 85% of stars, binary stars, not our sun."
00:20:04,00:20:07,"It's one of our suns on the special ones, which is on its own, I think."
00:20:07,00:20:10,"And mostly I think their primary star and then companion,"
00:20:10,00:20:13,which is like a smaller guy rotating around it.
00:20:13,00:20:16,"And the only way we know how big any stars are,"
00:20:16,00:20:20,"I like the only way we know how big this largest known woe star is,"
00:20:20,00:20:22,is because they're in pairs.
00:20:22,00:20:25,"And so you take the Barry Center, which is..."
00:20:25,00:20:27,The Barry Center.
00:20:27,00:20:27,"Yeah, yeah."
00:20:27,00:20:29,It's not an EastEnders thing.
00:20:29,00:20:29,It's like...
00:20:29,00:20:33,"We've performed at the Barry Center since South Wales, isn't it?"
00:20:33,00:20:37,"Yeah, all stars rotate around South Wales."
00:20:37,00:20:42,The Barry Center is the center around which the two stars in the binary system rotate.
00:20:42,00:20:45,And so you measure their distance from that and you watch them rotating.
00:20:45,00:20:48,And you hopefully watch one eclipse the other from Earth.
00:20:48,00:20:51,And you see kind of how long one takes to cross the other.
00:20:51,00:20:53,And that's how we know how big they are.
00:20:53,00:20:58,"So solitary stars, the only way we know how big a star that's on its own is,"
00:20:58,00:21:03,is that we compare its brightness to the brightness of these binary stars whose size we know.
00:21:03,00:21:05,"And we say, okay, well, we guess it's about that size."
00:21:05,00:21:06,How interesting.
00:21:06,00:21:07,"Except the suns, we're really close to the sun."
00:21:07,00:21:09,So we can measure that with a T measure.
00:21:11,00:21:15,So it is amazing thinking of just how different everything else is to here.
00:21:15,00:21:16,Okay.
00:21:16,00:21:20,"Because here we have conference centers, and we have book festivals,"
00:21:20,00:21:21,"and we have wine glasses, and we have tables."
00:21:21,00:21:22,And I'm just pointing at things I've seen out front.
00:21:22,00:21:23,We've got Dune.
00:21:23,00:21:24,We've got Dune.
00:21:24,00:21:26,I don't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing.
00:21:26,00:21:30,"But get this, 99.9% of all matter that we have observed in space"
00:21:30,00:21:33,"is not solid, all liquid, all gas."
00:21:33,00:21:33,It's plasma.
00:21:33,00:21:34,Okay.
00:21:34,00:21:36,Because that's what the state of matter that's found today.
00:21:37,00:21:39,"There's loose ions, electrons, and there's a kind of soup."
00:21:39,00:21:41,So our sun is plasma.
00:21:41,00:21:46,"There's a bit of plasma on Earth, lightning bolts, and neon signs."
00:21:46,00:21:47,"Oh, yeah."
00:21:47,00:21:53,"And those two things, 99.9% of the universe is plasma."
00:21:53,00:21:53,On TVs.
00:21:53,00:21:54,Plasma as well.
00:21:54,00:21:57,Yes.
00:21:57,00:22:02,I think it's the same stuff.
00:22:02,00:22:03,I think it might be the same.
00:22:03,00:22:04,Is it the same?
00:22:04,00:22:05,That's a good point.
00:22:05,00:22:05,I don't know.
00:22:06,00:22:09,"That's, you know, shooting stars are multicolored."
00:22:09,00:22:12,"When you see a shooting star, but you need to look really hard,"
00:22:12,00:22:15,which is hard to do because obviously they appear and then they just appear quickly.
00:22:15,00:22:17,"But it's because when, so they're obviously a meteor flying through the Earth's atmosphere"
00:22:17,00:22:19,and they're burning up in the atmosphere.
00:22:19,00:22:23,"But because the meteors are made of lots of different elements,"
00:22:23,00:22:26,"as they burn, they kind of react with the gases around them."
00:22:26,00:22:29,"And they create like magnesium oxide or whatever,"
00:22:29,00:22:32,"or, you know, all the different oxides, which burn with different colors."
00:22:32,00:22:34,"So if you look closely, you'll see bright blue."
00:22:34,00:22:35,They're bright purple.
00:22:35,00:22:37,"Like fireworks, I guess, right?"
00:22:37,00:22:39,"They are a fire, a very quick firework."
00:22:39,00:22:39,Yeah.
00:22:39,00:22:40,Yeah.
00:22:40,00:22:42,"But some animals, you know, who see, like pigeons,"
00:22:42,00:22:45,"see in more frames a second than we do, don't they?"
00:22:45,00:22:47,"So they probably, when they see a shooting star,"
00:22:47,00:22:48,it's probably like fireworks there.
00:22:48,00:22:52,"I'm not actually convinced that shooting stars exist, to be honest."
00:22:52,00:22:53,You never seen one?
00:22:53,00:22:56,"Well, no, because my wife always sees them because there's one,"
00:22:56,00:22:57,and I turn around and it's not there.
00:22:57,00:23:02,I think the only logical thing is that they don't exist and everyone's having me on.
00:23:02,00:23:03,Yeah.
00:23:03,00:23:03,Yeah.
00:23:03,00:23:04,A huge threat to them.
00:23:04,00:23:05,A huge threat to them.
00:23:05,00:23:07,"Oh, sorry."
00:23:07,00:23:12,I've got some really exciting space news from the last couple of weeks.
00:23:12,00:23:13,"Oh, yeah."
00:23:13,00:23:13,Go.
00:23:13,00:23:17,So there is a spacecraft that is going around the moons of Jupiter
00:23:17,00:23:20,because it's looking for life in our solar system.
00:23:20,00:23:25,"And good news, we have found life in the solar system."
00:23:25,00:23:27,This probe has managed to find life.
00:23:27,00:23:28,"We haven't, and it hasn't."
00:23:28,00:23:30,"Are you breaking the news of, yeah."
00:23:30,00:23:33,"Like, oh, they trusted you to have got the UMBC with this."
00:23:33,00:23:35,It's the 20th.
00:23:35,00:23:40,They were flying by and they pointed their telescope at a planet called Earth.
00:23:40,00:23:45,"And they found that, yes, indeed, Earth is habitable."
00:23:45,00:23:47,That's so funny.
00:23:47,00:23:50,"Obviously, it is important because it shows that it's working."
00:23:50,00:23:50,Yeah.
00:23:50,00:23:51,Right.
00:23:51,00:23:54,"You know, if they point to Earth and it says this is what is habitable."
00:23:54,00:23:55,That is playing on easy mode.
00:23:55,00:24:01,"My, I've got a neighbour who's got a really interesting space story."
00:24:01,00:24:05,So he's an artist and he did this really beautiful piece.
00:24:05,00:24:06,That's our solar system.
00:24:06,00:24:10,"And so I have a print of it in my son's room as well, Will's room."
00:24:10,00:24:13,"And a guy in America who's one of the co-hosts of Radio Lab,"
00:24:13,00:24:17,"one of the massive podcasts, he had it on his wall in his son's room."
00:24:17,00:24:18,And he kept looking at it.
00:24:18,00:24:22,"And Venus had a moon called Zuzvi, Z-O-O-Z-V-E."
00:24:22,00:24:26,"But he was like, he knew science."
00:24:26,00:24:28,He knows that Venus doesn't have a moon.
00:24:28,00:24:29,So what the hell was going on there?
00:24:29,00:24:31,He started looking into it more and more.
00:24:31,00:24:35,"And he got in touch with Alex, who is the illustrator, Alex Foster."
00:24:35,00:24:38,"And Alex said, I just found it on some little slip of paper, right?"
00:24:38,00:24:40,"It turns out for a very brief moment,"
00:24:40,00:24:45,a quasi-moon had been discovered going around Venus in 2002
00:24:45,00:24:49,and was given the name 2002-V-E.
00:24:49,00:24:53,But Alex misread it as Zuzvi and put it on this thing.
00:24:53,00:24:58,Now there are certain rules about when a quasi-moon can be named.
00:24:58,00:25:00,There's a planetary naming system that goes on.
00:25:00,00:25:03,One thing is you have to have had a paper or a book written about it.
00:25:03,00:25:06,"So between 2002 and this being drawn,"
00:25:06,00:25:10,"and then this discovery by this Radio Lab guy, a paper had been written."
00:25:10,00:25:12,So officially it can now be named.
00:25:12,00:25:15,And it has been officially named Zuzvi.
00:25:15,00:25:18,So the picture is now accurate.
00:25:18,00:25:23,"I remember finding a pill outside my house,"
00:25:23,00:25:27,which I thought must have been some drug dealer or a dropper or something.
00:25:27,00:25:29,And it was called Z-O-M-G.
00:25:29,00:25:31,"Like, OMG, but with a Z at the start."
00:25:31,00:25:33,"And I put a picture of it on the Internet and said,"
00:25:33,00:25:35,"""Does anyone know what drug this is?"""
00:25:35,00:25:37,And apparently it just was 20 milligrams.
00:25:37,00:25:40,I have paracetamol.
00:25:40,00:25:46,I love you bringing up the police.
00:25:46,00:25:47,I found a drugs nest.
00:25:47,00:25:50,"It's called Boots, and they have all sorts of stuff."
00:25:56,00:26:00,"It is time for fact number three, and that is Anna."
00:26:00,00:26:05,"My fact this week is that in 18th century Japan, you could eat vegetarian goose."
00:26:05,00:26:10,"Wow, and do you mean that the goose itself is not eating meat or...?"
00:26:10,00:26:13,"No, an actual vegetarian option."
00:26:13,00:26:19,"In restaurants in 18th century Japan, this is just them being way ahead of their time."
00:26:19,00:26:24,"I came across this in a book from 1790 called ""Recipes from the Soy Garden."""
00:26:24,00:26:27,"Or I think it's finally been reproduced in English,"
00:26:27,00:26:31,"and it's been titled ""Recipes from the Garden of Paradise"" or something."
00:26:31,00:26:35,"And it's by a guy called Yuan Mei, who was China's most famous poet."
00:26:35,00:26:37,So you'd expect him to be writing recipe books.
00:26:37,00:26:42,And he had a recipe in there for mock roast goose.
00:26:42,00:26:48,"And he said, ""The way you made it was you wrap yam in tofu skin."""
00:26:48,00:26:49,And that was it.
00:26:49,00:26:52,And I couldn't find many more details on how to do it.
00:26:52,00:26:55,"By the way, as you get a load of yams, you kind of sculpt it into the shape of goose."
00:26:55,00:26:59,"And then you wrap it in what's actually this thing called yuba,"
00:26:59,00:27:00,which is a really interesting ingredient.
00:27:00,00:27:03,But it's the skin you get on the top of soy milk.
00:27:03,00:27:07,"So if you have normal dairy milk, then you have that delicious skin on the top of it."
00:27:07,00:27:09,"Soy milk, same thing."
00:27:09,00:27:12,"They would peel it off very carefully, hang it up,"
00:27:12,00:27:14,and then allow more and more skin to form.
00:27:14,00:27:17,And that's a really crucial ingredient of its own.
00:27:17,00:27:19,And you'd wrap the yam in that.
00:27:19,00:27:22,"And actually they'd make some stuff just from that yuba, didn't they?"
00:27:22,00:27:23,They'd make vegetarian stuff.
00:27:23,00:27:27,"Because when it comes out, it's really sort of like plasticine,"
00:27:27,00:27:29,and you can mold it into any shape you want.
00:27:29,00:27:32,And so you could shape it into any meat you wanted.
00:27:32,00:27:38,"So there were dishes like butter's chicken, butter's fish, butter's duck, molded pig's head,"
00:27:38,00:27:42,"molded ham, and they were all made out of this yuba that was just put into different shapes."
00:27:42,00:27:43,It's very cool.
00:27:43,00:27:48,"I didn't realize that it was virtually invented, the idea of this fake meat,"
00:27:48,00:27:52,as a transition to get you to just being a vegetarian.
00:27:52,00:27:54,It was like weaning you off the real deals.
00:27:54,00:27:57,So you would slowly get the sensation that you were eating this thing still.
00:27:57,00:27:59,But it wasn't what it was.
00:27:59,00:28:02,"And then eventually you'd be like, ""Well, yeah, I don't really fancy meat anymore."""
00:28:02,00:28:03,And then you go straight to the vegetarian stuff.
00:28:03,00:28:07,But you are full vegetarian if you're eating yam in the shape of a goose.
00:28:07,00:28:07,I think that's fine.
00:28:07,00:28:09,You don't need to go any further.
00:28:09,00:28:09,That's fine.
00:28:09,00:28:10,Yes.
00:28:10,00:28:14,"But sometimes you need the psychological reasoning to go, ""Oh, I'm still having--"
00:28:14,00:28:17,"I guess like today, if you have an impossible burger or something,"
00:28:17,00:28:19,it's like a transition to--
00:28:19,00:28:19,Yeah.
00:28:19,00:28:22,Because you still kind of want the taste of meat.
00:28:22,00:28:22,But you--
00:28:22,00:28:23,Yeah.
00:28:23,00:28:23,I know.
00:28:23,00:28:24,But I think you're there.
00:28:24,00:28:25,I really do.
00:28:25,00:28:26,Yeah.
00:28:26,00:28:26,It's okay.
00:28:26,00:28:28,Keep eating the yammy goose.
00:28:28,00:28:29,But I do.
00:28:29,00:28:32,"And I just stuck on the fake meats now, which I really--"
00:28:32,00:28:35,They're really not that sort of fascinating as well as pretty good.
00:28:35,00:28:36,A lot of them.
00:28:36,00:28:38,"Anyway, one of the things--"
00:28:38,00:28:40,"Sorry, I've completely lost my train of thought."
00:28:40,00:28:42,Can I just quickly just add to that the old--
00:28:42,00:28:43,I'll get back.
00:28:43,00:28:44,We just got to sit inside of it.
00:28:44,00:28:44,"Okay, sure."
00:28:44,00:28:45,I'll do it.
00:28:45,00:28:46,I'll do it.
00:28:46,00:28:46,I don't know.
00:28:46,00:28:47,I believe in you.
00:28:47,00:28:48,I'm doing it.
00:28:48,00:28:50,I have the pressures on--
00:28:50,00:28:52,"I think if you had a bit more protein in your diet,"
00:28:52,00:28:54,you wouldn't have this problem.
00:28:54,00:28:57,So all I was going to say was that it's almost all the way through history.
00:28:57,00:28:59,"So tofu was invented at about 200 BC,"
00:28:59,00:29:01,was when it started being invented.
00:29:01,00:29:03,It's almost all either religious reasons
00:29:03,00:29:05,"or times extreme economic hardship,"
00:29:05,00:29:08,where there just isn't any meat to go around.
00:29:08,00:29:10,"And those are the two huge factors,"
00:29:10,00:29:12,until recently when it's been more of a climatey thing.
00:29:12,00:29:12,Right.
00:29:12,00:29:16,"But in the 1990s, Cuba had a big economic crisis."
00:29:16,00:29:19,"And they made a thing that was steak,"
00:29:19,00:29:22,but it was made from breaded and fried grapefruit rind.
00:29:22,00:29:24,And it was--
00:29:24,00:29:25,"I mean, they had a lot of--"
00:29:25,00:29:28,"Wow, an even less delicious part of a grapefruit,"
00:29:28,00:29:29,which already is quite disgusting.
00:29:29,00:29:32,"There was soy picadillo,"
00:29:32,00:29:34,"which I found described in the Havana Times,"
00:29:34,00:29:37,as the worst ground meat-like substance
00:29:37,00:29:40,that any human beings ever tasted in the 20th century.
00:29:40,00:29:41,Wow.
00:29:41,00:29:43,"So it is, yeah, doesn't always work."
00:29:43,00:29:44,"In the Oxford Companions of Food,"
00:29:44,00:29:48,"which I think we've all dipped into from time to time in England,"
00:29:48,00:29:52,is probably the Bible of facts about food.
00:29:52,00:29:54,"When you go into the fake meat section,"
00:29:54,00:29:58,they say that bread people is part of this whole thing.
00:29:58,00:30:02,And bread people is basically a human made out of bread.
00:30:02,00:30:05,"And it seems a bit like a gingerbread man, right?"
00:30:05,00:30:07,So is it a mythical sort of like--
00:30:07,00:30:08,"No, it's just like--"
00:30:08,00:30:10,"It's literally just like a loaf of bread,"
00:30:10,00:30:12,but it's in the shape of a person.
00:30:12,00:30:13,And they say--
00:30:13,00:30:15,"And they used to obey bread life, didn't they?"
00:30:15,00:30:17,"Well, they say in the Oxford Companions of Food"
00:30:17,00:30:20,that it is almost universal through all cultures of history.
00:30:20,00:30:21,But they've always had a bread post in their culture.
00:30:21,00:30:23,"They've always had bread people,"
00:30:23,00:30:27,and they say that they are a form of guilt-free cannibalism.
00:30:27,00:30:30,"Oh, that's what I was wondering."
00:30:30,00:30:31,Is that the transition away from eating human?
00:30:31,00:30:38,It says the taboo of eating fellow humans is almost universal.
00:30:38,00:30:41,And so we have to eat bread instead.
00:30:41,00:30:42,Wow.
00:30:42,00:30:42,That's so sweet.
00:30:42,00:30:45,I don't know what the celiac gluten-free people do.
00:30:45,00:30:46,They probably keep doing the cannibalism.
00:30:46,00:30:47,You've got to.
00:30:47,00:30:48,You've got to.
00:30:48,00:30:52,"I did read that in the Second World War,"
00:30:52,00:30:54,people were encouraged to eat meat substitute
00:30:54,00:30:57,and brown bread was advertised as a meat substitute
00:30:57,00:30:59,"because I think it had a slightly more protein,"
00:30:59,00:31:00,"I think, than white bread."
00:31:00,00:31:02,So it was in all over the newspapers and stuff.
00:31:02,00:31:04,"You know, hey, rather than eating a steak,"
00:31:04,00:31:06,I tried a loaf of brown bread.
00:31:06,00:31:07,"Yeah, it is."
00:31:07,00:31:10,"One of the founders of alternative meat,"
00:31:10,00:31:13,"as it gets called, or artificial meat or cultured meat,"
00:31:13,00:31:15,was a guy called Willem van Eelen.
00:31:15,00:31:16,And he was Dutch.
00:31:16,00:31:19,"And he had his experience in the Second World War,"
00:31:19,00:31:20,"his formative experience,"
00:31:20,00:31:24,"because he was in a prisoner of war camp, a Japanese one,"
00:31:24,00:31:26,and food was incredibly short.
00:31:26,00:31:30,And he was very lucky to live and not starve.
00:31:30,00:31:31,"And a few years after the war,"
00:31:31,00:31:33,he went to medical school in 1948.
00:31:33,00:31:35,"And he found that researchers there,"
00:31:35,00:31:37,they were trying to grow some cells in a tank.
00:31:37,00:31:38,They weren't trying to grow it for meat.
00:31:38,00:31:40,"They were trying to grow it as a skin graft thing,"
00:31:40,00:31:43,"if you've been burned, you know, to graft on your skin."
00:31:43,00:31:44,"And his first thought,"
00:31:44,00:31:46,"because of his formative experiences in the war,"
00:31:46,00:31:48,"were, ""I wonder if we could eat that?"""
00:31:48,00:31:51,"You know, he had just been so hungry for such a long time,"
00:31:51,00:31:54,it had really sort of imprinted itself on his consciousness.
00:31:54,00:31:57,And that set him on the path of developing cultured meat.
00:31:57,00:32:00,"Wow, you'd be nervous around him, I think, whatever, you know."
00:32:00,00:32:03,And he exposed body parts to cover up.
00:32:03,00:32:04,"It's almost like in a cartoon,"
00:32:04,00:32:05,"where he turns around and looks at you,"
00:32:05,00:32:07,and you've turned into a roast chicken.
00:32:07,00:32:09,"It was a bit like that for him, yeah."
00:32:10,00:32:11,That was incredible.
00:32:11,00:32:15,"Apparently, peanut butter was invented largely"
00:32:15,00:32:18,as a substitute for people who found really hard to eat meat.
00:32:18,00:32:20,"Oh, really? George Washington's cover?"
00:32:20,00:32:24,"Yeah, I think it might have been a Kellogg version of peanut butter."
00:32:24,00:32:26,"So, like, there was quite a few peanut butter innovations"
00:32:26,00:32:27,going on at the time.
00:32:27,00:32:29,"Kellogg certainly, like, promoted nut meat, yeah."
00:32:29,00:32:30,"Yeah, nut meat."
00:32:30,00:32:31,I actually have a soul mate.
00:32:31,00:32:33,That is a scam.
00:32:33,00:32:34,"You're okay, huh?"
00:32:34,00:32:36,You hardly touch your nut meat.
00:32:39,00:32:41,"None of this stuff is substitute meat, though."
00:32:41,00:32:43,This is annoying so much.
00:32:43,00:32:45,"Like, in China, ancient China and Japan,"
00:32:45,00:32:46,"they were just eating tofu and soy,"
00:32:46,00:32:49,because they ate tofu and soy as well.
00:32:49,00:32:50,"And this is when you read it in the 19th century,"
00:32:50,00:32:53,"when it was just coming to Britain and to Europe,"
00:32:53,00:32:57,"and, like, all of these Chinese Japanese recipes were coming over,"
00:32:57,00:32:58,they were actually really positive.
00:32:58,00:32:59,"Across the media, they were like,"
00:32:59,00:33:02,"""Wow, this soy stuff can be made into a thing"
00:33:02,00:33:04,"that is a little bit like meat."""
00:33:04,00:33:06,"But because it didn't have the connotation of,"
00:33:06,00:33:09,"""Oh, we're gonna take away your meat and make you eat soy,"""
00:33:09,00:33:10,then no one was negative about it.
00:33:10,00:33:12,It's really interesting to see.
00:33:12,00:33:13,"But, yeah, there were fake sausages."
00:33:13,00:33:19,"I think the first reference to a fake sausage came in 1851,"
00:33:19,00:33:23,"and it was described as being by a graemite,"
00:33:23,00:33:24,which I didn't know what that was.
00:33:24,00:33:26,Do you know a graemite?
00:33:26,00:33:27,It's a religious thing?
00:33:27,00:33:28,Yes.
00:33:28,00:33:30,And do you know what we get from graemites today?
00:33:30,00:33:30,Graem's crackers?
00:33:30,00:33:32,"Yeah, I did."
00:33:32,00:33:33,I've never knew this.
00:33:33,00:33:35,"Graemite, which is actually a thing I only know"
00:33:35,00:33:36,"from friends' episodes,"
00:33:36,00:33:36,because I think they're in a bad thing.
00:33:36,00:33:38,"Yeah, I'm not convinced I know what one is."
00:33:38,00:33:39,No.
00:33:39,00:33:40,They don't exist.
00:33:40,00:33:41,So I like shooting stars.
00:33:41,00:33:44,It's all a prank.
00:33:44,00:33:46,"He was a big old veggie anyway,"
00:33:46,00:33:48,and he invented sort of bread.
00:33:48,00:33:50,"He thought that bread had been tortured the way we made it,"
00:33:50,00:33:51,because we ground it so hard.
00:33:51,00:33:53,"So he said that we should make bread,"
00:33:53,00:33:55,but leave the flour much rougher and coarser.
00:33:55,00:33:57,So that's what Graem's crackers are made of.
00:33:57,00:33:57,"Okay, interesting."
00:33:57,00:34:01,"So impossible foods, impossible burgers and stuff,"
00:34:01,00:34:03,they are tested on animals.
00:34:03,00:34:04,Really?
00:34:04,00:34:07,And is it they're fed to animals to see if they like them?
00:34:07,00:34:07,Cool.
00:34:07,00:34:10,"So they have this thing called heme in it,"
00:34:10,00:34:13,which is a vegetable-based liquid
00:34:13,00:34:15,that looks a little bit like blood.
00:34:15,00:34:17,"And so you put it in your fake burgers,"
00:34:17,00:34:18,"and then when you cut into it,"
00:34:18,00:34:20,"it looks like there's blood in your burgers,"
00:34:20,00:34:21,and that's what people want.
00:34:21,00:34:23,But the USDA--
00:34:23,00:34:24,Because people are normal.
00:34:24,00:34:25,"Yeah, I know, I know."
00:34:25,00:34:28,"Like, sure, I love them, I think they're delicious."
00:34:28,00:34:32,"But the USDA said that even though they appear to be safe,"
00:34:32,00:34:34,they need it to be tested properly
00:34:34,00:34:36,before they can go into the burgers.
00:34:36,00:34:38,"And they could have done it without testing on animals,"
00:34:38,00:34:40,but it would have taken years and years and years.
00:34:40,00:34:41,Really?
00:34:41,00:34:42,And so they tested just on--
00:34:42,00:34:44,"I think just on one animal, actually."
00:34:44,00:34:46,Or certainly just one or two.
00:34:46,00:34:50,"The guy who was in charge of it, Patrick O. Brown,"
00:34:50,00:34:51,"has basically come out and said,"
00:34:51,00:34:52,"""Yeah, look, we had to do it really."""
00:34:52,00:34:55,"And like, it was just a one-off."
00:34:55,00:34:57,"And we think that overall, holistically,"
00:34:57,00:34:59,"it's better that we did that one small thing,"
00:34:59,00:35:01,"because overall, it's a good thing."
00:35:01,00:35:03,"Yeah, you know, Tofurkey?"
00:35:03,00:35:04,Yeah.
00:35:04,00:35:05,Familiar with Tofurkey?
00:35:05,00:35:06,No.
00:35:06,00:35:07,A tofu turkey?
00:35:07,00:35:09,It's vegetarian turkey.
00:35:09,00:35:10,"It's quite American, isn't it?"
00:35:10,00:35:10,It is.
00:35:10,00:35:12,It was a big thing in the '90s.
00:35:12,00:35:13,"Well, the guy who invented it, Seth Tibbet,"
00:35:13,00:35:16,was so broke when he invented Tofurkey
00:35:16,00:35:17,that he was living in a tree house.
00:35:17,00:35:20,What's the name of that rug?
00:35:20,00:35:21,And it wasn't even--
00:35:21,00:35:25,He was renting a tree house rather than killing.
00:35:25,00:35:29,"I've actually stayed in a couple of Airbnb tree houses,"
00:35:29,00:35:31,"and they are not cheap, I've got to say."
00:35:31,00:35:32,"Yeah, well, he was actually--"
00:35:32,00:35:34,He was renting the trees.
00:35:34,00:35:36,He rented three trees and built the tree house
00:35:36,00:35:38,in between them for the farmer.
00:35:38,00:35:39,"Oh, you can't do that."
00:35:39,00:35:41,What do you mean?
00:35:41,00:35:43,You can't rent a tree and then build property on--
00:35:43,00:35:45,"Well, he had asked for permission to do it."
00:35:45,00:35:46,"Oh, OK."
00:35:46,00:35:46,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:35:46,00:35:47,Let that bit out.
00:35:47,00:35:47,Sorry.
00:35:47,00:35:50,"Anyway, there you go."
00:35:50,00:35:53,"Guys, I will have to move us on to our final fact"
00:35:53,00:35:54,in a second.
00:35:54,00:35:55,"So, yeah, if you've got anything."
00:35:55,00:35:58,Guess what the first meat that NASA experimented
00:35:58,00:36:01,with growing so that potentially astronauts
00:36:01,00:36:03,could culture their own sort of cell-cultured meat
00:36:03,00:36:04,in space was?
00:36:04,00:36:05,Guess what the first meat they tried was?
00:36:05,00:36:07,"Oh, well, steak."
00:36:07,00:36:08,Goldfish.
00:36:08,00:36:08,Goldfish?
00:36:08,00:36:11,Goldfish?
00:36:11,00:36:12,"Come on, bit."
00:36:12,00:36:15,"Yep, they took some goldfish steaks"
00:36:15,00:36:16,and they tried to--
00:36:16,00:36:17,Goldfish steaks?
00:36:17,00:36:22,"If I order a steak and that comes, I'm sending it back."
00:36:22,00:36:28,"Yeah, they were just trying to grow the goldfish muscle"
00:36:28,00:36:28,in there.
00:36:28,00:36:29,How was it?
00:36:29,00:36:31,It must have been like--
00:36:31,00:36:33,"Because they do grow quite big goldfish, don't they?"
00:36:33,00:36:34,"Yeah, it's not like one of those little ones"
00:36:34,00:36:35,you get in the fair.
00:36:35,00:36:36,"I don't think so, no."
00:36:36,00:36:38,"But I think, anyway, it wasn't--"
00:36:38,00:36:38,That's so funny.
00:36:38,00:36:40,I don't think anyone-- it even got to being tasted.
00:36:40,00:36:41,"Yeah, right."
00:36:41,00:36:44,"Can I quickly tell you, do you know why soy sauce"
00:36:44,00:36:45,is called soy sauce?
00:36:45,00:36:46,Because it has soy in it.
00:36:46,00:36:47,And it's saucy.
00:36:47,00:36:51,Dan is actually right about the sauce bit.
00:36:51,00:36:56,"No, soy beans are named after soy sauce."
00:36:56,00:36:57,"Come on, bit."
00:36:57,00:37:00,"No, how did that-- how does that work?"
00:37:00,00:37:02,How did they get-- who found the first soy sauce?
00:37:02,00:37:04,That's like the time loop there.
00:37:04,00:37:06,You grow soy sauce and you separate it into beans.
00:37:06,00:37:15,"Yeah, we just got soy, which again, it came over from Japan."
00:37:15,00:37:16,It was about 1300s.
00:37:16,00:37:19,"It was called shoyu, the sauce that they made from beans,"
00:37:19,00:37:20,which they didn't call shoyu beans.
00:37:20,00:37:21,They call it something different.
00:37:21,00:37:24,"And so we, for a couple of hundred years,"
00:37:24,00:37:28,called it an all across the variations of soy sauce.
00:37:28,00:37:29,No one knew what it was made of.
00:37:29,00:37:30,So everyone tried to make substitutes out of--
00:37:30,00:37:33,the first ketchup was an attempt to make soy sauce.
00:37:33,00:37:36,"Oh, so they put round of fish and mushrooms and all that stuff."
00:37:36,00:37:37,Exactly.
00:37:37,00:37:38,"Yeah, a lot of mushroom attempts."
00:37:38,00:37:39,"And then they realized, oh, they use this weird bean."
00:37:39,00:37:41,Let's call it the soy bean.
00:37:41,00:37:42,And that's why it was like that.
00:37:42,00:37:43,That's amazing.
00:37:43,00:37:50,It's time for a final fact to show.
00:37:50,00:37:51,And that is my fact.
00:37:51,00:37:55,"My fact this week is that after Bruce Lee died,"
00:37:55,00:37:58,Chinese movie studios tried to exploit the gap he left
00:37:58,00:38:04,"by immediately releasing films starring Bruce Lai, Lee Bruce,"
00:38:04,00:38:06,and Brut Lee.
00:38:06,00:38:15,"This was-- it's called Bruceploitation, where after he sadly passed away,"
00:38:15,00:38:19,"very prematurely, the Chinese studios went, America wants Bruce Lee movies."
00:38:19,00:38:21,So he did Enter the Dragon.
00:38:21,00:38:24,"Quickly, let's get re-Enter the Dragon into production."
00:38:24,00:38:26,They like the name Bruce and Lee quickly.
00:38:26,00:38:30,Let's just find other people and name them that in very similar ways.
00:38:30,00:38:33,"Bruce Lai is now starring in Bruce Lee versus Superman,"
00:38:33,00:38:36,"which is a movie, by the way, from this period."
00:38:36,00:38:39,"OK, so they didn't find people with these names."
00:38:39,00:38:40,They found people and then gave them these names.
00:38:40,00:38:43,"Yeah, I think that's an easier way of doing it, to be fair."
00:38:43,00:38:47,"Yeah, because if you find Lee Bruce or whatever,"
00:38:47,00:38:49,"and he's like an out-of-work accountant,"
00:38:49,00:38:53,"then it's going to be harder to get him in shape, isn't it?"
00:38:53,00:38:55,"I don't know if there's two Patrick Stewart's, you're going to get--"
00:38:55,00:38:56,Yeah.
00:38:56,00:39:00,"Dan, I presume you're a big Bruce Lee fan."
00:39:00,00:39:01,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:39:01,00:39:01,"Yeah, grew up on it."
00:39:01,00:39:02,Because you grew up in Hong Kong.
00:39:02,00:39:02,Yeah.
00:39:02,00:39:03,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:39:03,00:39:04,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:39:04,00:39:06,Have you seen The Game of Death?
00:39:06,00:39:07,"Yeah, this was the movie he was making,"
00:39:07,00:39:10,like he died halfway through making.
00:39:10,00:39:11,Exactly.
00:39:11,00:39:14,"And they had a problem because they had 40 minutes of Bruce Lee footage,"
00:39:14,00:39:17,and you're not allowed to make a film that's 40 minutes long.
00:39:17,00:39:20,So they just hired body doubles.
00:39:20,00:39:21,They put them in sunglasses.
00:39:21,00:39:24,"They filmed them, you know, at a distance."
00:39:24,00:39:26,Or in silhouette.
00:39:26,00:39:29,Or they used some footage of Bruce Lee's actual funeral.
00:39:29,00:39:31,Bit weird.
00:39:31,00:39:31,"Oh, wow."
00:39:31,00:39:31,Yeah.
00:39:31,00:39:33,"Also, it completely rose the point of the film, I'd guess,"
00:39:33,00:39:35,"if you think, oh, well, there he is, he's dead."
00:39:35,00:39:36,But anyway.
00:39:36,00:39:36,Yeah.
00:39:36,00:39:39,And they just sort of fattened the thing up into a Bruce Lee movie.
00:39:39,00:39:41,And it was five years after his death that they released this.
00:39:41,00:39:42,"Well, that's the thing."
00:39:42,00:39:43,"I mean, if you look at the list of movies,"
00:39:43,00:39:45,like that was called Game of Death.
00:39:45,00:39:45,Yeah.
00:39:45,00:39:47,They then released New Game of Death.
00:39:47,00:39:51,"Like, Bruce Lee, the star of all stars, Bruce Lee's secret."
00:39:51,00:39:52,Bruce Lee in New Guinea.
00:39:52,00:39:54,"Like, just like--"
00:39:54,00:39:56,"Like, it's so weird that there was this massive demand."
00:39:56,00:39:57,Because I haven't--
00:39:57,00:39:59,I really didn't know anything about Bruce Lee.
00:39:59,00:40:01,And didn't know how fascinated I'd be by him.
00:40:01,00:40:03,He is an amazing character.
00:40:03,00:40:05,"But I also didn't realize he was not big,"
00:40:05,00:40:08,"really at all, until he died in America."
00:40:08,00:40:09,So he was massive in Hong Kong.
00:40:09,00:40:12,"He'd done, I think it was his fourth American film,"
00:40:12,00:40:13,Enter the Dragon.
00:40:13,00:40:15,And that was really the film that made him really big.
00:40:15,00:40:16,And everyone loved him.
00:40:16,00:40:18,And he died a couple of weeks before the premiere.
00:40:18,00:40:19,Three weeks before the premiere.
00:40:19,00:40:22,"Very, very young, very sadly in his early 30s."
00:40:22,00:40:24,"And yeah, hadn't been big at all before then."
00:40:24,00:40:26,And then was this huge deal.
00:40:26,00:40:28,"But the New York Times obituary when he died,"
00:40:28,00:40:30,"three weeks before that big film came out,"
00:40:30,00:40:33,"said, ""His films were successful in New York"
00:40:33,00:40:35,by unanimously disapproving reviews.
00:40:35,00:40:40,And the film Fist of Fury makes the worst Italian Western
00:40:40,00:40:42,look like the most solemn and noble achievements
00:40:42,00:40:43,"of the early Soviet cinema."""
00:40:43,00:40:44,Wow.
00:40:44,00:40:46,That's in his old obituary.
00:40:46,00:40:47,"Yeah, yeah."
00:40:47,00:40:48,And that's it.
00:40:48,00:40:51,It was nothing good.
00:40:51,00:40:54,It said he had begun to win audiences in Latin America.
00:40:54,00:40:57,The end.
00:40:57,00:40:57,It's so weird.
00:40:57,00:41:00,"Because he's, I mean, he's big all over the world now, right?"
00:41:00,00:41:01,I think.
00:41:01,00:41:04,Because I was in Mostar in Bosnia.
00:41:04,00:41:07,"And there's a statue of him there in the middle of Mostar,"
00:41:07,00:41:08,which I saw.
00:41:08,00:41:09,And the reason that there's a statue there
00:41:09,00:41:12,is because it was just after the Balkan War.
00:41:12,00:41:14,"They had the Croatians, the Bosnians,"
00:41:14,00:41:15,"the Serbians, everyone."
00:41:15,00:41:17,"Everybody was kung fu fighting, yes?"
00:41:20,00:41:24,[LAUGHTER]
00:41:24,00:41:26,I'm very sorry to trivialise.
00:41:26,00:41:28,What was an appalling conflict?
00:41:28,00:41:34,"And it was a little bit frightening, yes."
00:41:34,00:41:36,"But they needed the statue of someone,"
00:41:36,00:41:38,and they couldn't decide who to get a statue of.
00:41:38,00:41:39,And Bruce Lee was the only one that everyone
00:41:39,00:41:40,agreed they liked.
00:41:40,00:41:41,[LAUGHTER]
00:41:41,00:41:41,Really?
00:41:41,00:41:43,And it's still there in the middle of the park.
00:41:43,00:41:44,"It's outside of town, yeah?"
00:41:44,00:41:45,It's interesting.
00:41:45,00:41:46,But I'd heard of the statue.
00:41:46,00:41:47,I had no idea that was the reason for it.
00:41:47,00:41:48,"Someone stole it, right?"
00:41:48,00:41:50,It was there when I was there.
00:41:50,00:41:50,Right.
00:41:50,00:41:53,I think at one point it got stolen.
00:41:53,00:41:53,They didn't see who it was.
00:41:53,00:41:54,It was as fast as lightning.
00:41:54,00:41:56,[LAUGHTER]
00:41:56,00:41:57,But it was stolen.
00:41:57,00:41:59,"And apparently during that fight,"
00:41:59,00:42:02,"where they put it up as a bit of peace,"
00:42:02,00:42:06,the way they faced it was towards one of the sides.
00:42:06,00:42:09,"So the statue of Bruce, in his fighting stance,"
00:42:09,00:42:10,to them was offensive.
00:42:10,00:42:11,"Because they were like, you're suggesting"
00:42:11,00:42:13,"Bruce is on your team now, and he's fighting us."
00:42:13,00:42:15,I heard that as well.
00:42:15,00:42:15,Yeah.
00:42:15,00:42:17,"But again, contain multitudes, Bruce Lee."
00:42:17,00:42:20,"So he wrote a lot of poetry, which was published."
00:42:20,00:42:25,Former Hong Kong Cha Cha champion.
00:42:25,00:42:27,"That's the champion of the Cha Cha dance, right?"
00:42:27,00:42:29,"Sorry, I didn't just do one of it."
00:42:29,00:42:30,That's stuttering.
00:42:30,00:42:32,"Temporary localised stuff, yeah."
00:42:32,00:42:35,"And his wife was Swedish, Swedish-American."
00:42:35,00:42:36,Hey!
00:42:36,00:42:37,It's the fact.
00:42:37,00:42:38,And that was--
00:42:38,00:42:40,"The wife who he cheated on to jag the mistress,"
00:42:40,00:42:41,whose house he was found dead in.
00:42:41,00:42:43,Hey!
00:42:43,00:42:46,Who was a good friend of my mum and dad?
00:42:46,00:42:49,"Betsy Ting, the woman whose house he died in"
00:42:49,00:42:50,knows your mum and dad.
00:42:50,00:42:51,The woman who there were conspiracy theories
00:42:51,00:42:53,all over the world that she was somehow
00:42:53,00:42:54,responsible for his death.
00:42:54,00:42:58,My parents started those conspiracy theories.
00:42:58,00:43:02,Sally runs in the family.
00:43:02,00:43:04,"Along with his films, when they were filming"
00:43:04,00:43:08,"the fight scenes, the extras in Enter the Dragon,"
00:43:08,00:43:10,"many of them were actually in local gangs,"
00:43:10,00:43:12,"or triad gangs, in Hong Kong."
00:43:12,00:43:14,"So quite frequently, they would keep fighting"
00:43:14,00:43:17,after the director yelled cut.
00:43:17,00:43:18,Just cut?
00:43:18,00:43:21,"Yes, I have him!"
00:43:21,00:43:23,"Yeah, because that's the thing with Bruce Lee, right?"
00:43:23,00:43:25,He was in gangs in Hong Kong.
00:43:25,00:43:26,Is that right?
00:43:26,00:43:27,He had to-- yeah.
00:43:27,00:43:28,"So yeah, tell the story, then."
00:43:28,00:43:29,"When he was young, he got in a fight."
00:43:29,00:43:32,"He picked a wrong fight with a gang leader,"
00:43:32,00:43:35,"and that's the reason he ended up going over to America,"
00:43:35,00:43:36,"because he was fleeing death, basically."
00:43:36,00:43:38,He had to get away.
00:43:38,00:43:39,That's right.
00:43:39,00:43:42,"And then he was a great martial artist,"
00:43:42,00:43:43,but he did lots of different martial arts.
00:43:43,00:43:46,But he always said that the reason he was so good at it
00:43:46,00:43:48,is because his right leg is one inch shorter
00:43:48,00:43:53,"than his left leg, which apparently helped his kicking."
00:43:53,00:43:57,"And he was also nearsighted, so he liked to do close combat,"
00:43:57,00:44:01,because then he could see the person he was hitting.
00:44:01,00:44:03,"Well, apparently on set one day,"
00:44:03,00:44:06,they were in an area where the locals were very unhappy
00:44:06,00:44:07,"that they were filming there,"
00:44:07,00:44:09,"and he was talking to the director,"
00:44:09,00:44:11,"and they were standing on a sort of hilltop,"
00:44:11,00:44:14,"and they started getting surrounded by the locals,"
00:44:14,00:44:17,and they knew that something bad was about to happen.
00:44:17,00:44:20,"And apparently what Bruce did was he jumped into the air,"
00:44:20,00:44:26,"and he pulled a perfect horizontal plank, basically,"
00:44:26,00:44:27,in the air.
00:44:27,00:44:30,"So the way he jumped, it looked like he was levitating,"
00:44:30,00:44:32,"and then he came back down on his legs,"
00:44:32,00:44:35,"and apparently everyone was like, ""Wow, Bruce!"""
00:44:35,00:44:36,And then they didn't beat them up.
00:44:36,00:44:41,At least that's the story my parents have been telling me about.
00:44:41,00:44:46,He was supposed to be drafted by the U.S. Army.
00:44:46,00:44:49,"In fact, he was drafted, but he didn't see any service,"
00:44:49,00:44:51,because he failed a medical.
00:44:51,00:44:52,Apparently he had bad eyesight.
00:44:52,00:44:54,"As I said, he had a sinus disorder,"
00:44:54,00:44:56,and he only had one testicle.
00:44:56,00:44:57,"Oh, yeah."
00:44:57,00:44:58,"So it's quite interesting,"
00:44:58,00:45:00,"because that means I couldn't get in the U.S. Army,"
00:45:00,00:45:02,because I also have bad sinuses.
00:45:02,00:45:08,"But you have three testicles, which one do you have?"
00:45:08,00:45:09,"A super soldier, yeah."
00:45:09,00:45:12,Was it the one that had not descended?
00:45:12,00:45:13,"Yeah, it's just not descended."
00:45:13,00:45:16,"Yeah, I read that put as,"
00:45:16,00:45:18,"""So it was impossible to kick Bruce Lee in the testicles."""
00:45:18,00:45:19,It's pretty cool.
00:45:19,00:45:19,That's true.
00:45:19,00:45:21,"You could kick him in the testicle, though,"
00:45:21,00:45:23,which I should imagine hurts just as bad.
00:45:23,00:45:27,"I did read, so there's a book called ""The Tower of Bruce Lee,"""
00:45:27,00:45:29,"which I was reading about by an author called David Miller,"
00:45:29,00:45:31,"and he reckons that Bruce Lee actually really, in his life,"
00:45:31,00:45:33,he only had a few proper fights.
00:45:33,00:45:36,"You know, obviously it's mostly screen and training and all of this,"
00:45:36,00:45:39,"and he says, ""I just wanted to quote this, I really like this line."""
00:45:39,00:45:41,"He was an absolutely remarkable man,"
00:45:41,00:45:43,"but he wasn't the Jesus of martial arts,"
00:45:43,00:45:45,and that's the way he's often presented these days.
00:45:45,00:45:48,Could he have stuck his fingers in your eyes more quickly
00:45:48,00:45:49,than anyone else on the planet?
00:45:49,00:45:50,Maybe so.
00:45:50,00:45:54,But what you have to remember
00:45:54,00:45:56,is that is exactly what he would have done.
00:45:56,00:45:57,That's real fighting.
00:45:57,00:45:59,"He would have stuck his fingers in your eyes,"
00:45:59,00:46:01,"kicked you in the leg, and got the hell out of there."
00:46:01,00:46:01,Right.
00:46:01,00:46:03,And that's apparently the...
00:46:03,00:46:04,"Well, apparently he was so quick."
00:46:04,00:46:06,"What he could do is, if you laid your palm out"
00:46:06,00:46:08,"and you had a pound coin on there,"
00:46:08,00:46:12,"he could grab it out of your hand before you closed your hand,"
00:46:12,00:46:13,"and then when you opened your hand,"
00:46:13,00:46:16,he had replaced the pound with a penny.
00:46:16,00:46:17,Okay.
00:46:17,00:46:18,As in as you were opening it...
00:46:18,00:46:19,"That's who you were like, ""What?"""
00:46:19,00:46:21,"So imagine like you were Bruce,"
00:46:21,00:46:22,"and I was like, ""Go!"""
00:46:22,00:46:24,"And I closed my hand, and I'm like, ""Haha."""
00:46:24,00:46:25,"You didn't get it, and then I opened it,"
00:46:25,00:46:27,and I see you've changed.
00:46:27,00:46:28,"You were so quick, you took it,"
00:46:28,00:46:30,and you put a new coin in place of my coin.
00:46:30,00:46:31,"Oh, I suppose as you've picked up the pound,"
00:46:31,00:46:33,you've put a penny in.
00:46:33,00:46:33,"No, I could do that."
00:46:33,00:46:37,I could do that.
00:46:37,00:46:40,He just said some weird targets for himself.
00:46:40,00:46:43,"It was like the original Guinness World Record Breaker,"
00:46:43,00:46:44,and then break them.
00:46:44,00:46:46,And he did want to kind of hone himself
00:46:46,00:46:48,"into this perfect human specimen,"
00:46:48,00:46:51,which weirdly people thought might be why he died.
00:46:51,00:46:55,There was a thought that he just had eradicated from his body
00:46:55,00:46:57,"all extraneous anything,"
00:46:57,00:46:59,and that sort of killed him somehow.
00:46:59,00:47:00,"Yeah, it's not really..."
00:47:00,00:47:02,"Bad body of parents, look at that one."
00:47:02,00:47:05,"That's not the story of the Shriver Denitator,"
00:47:05,00:47:06,I can tell you that.
00:47:06,00:47:08,"I buy this, I buy this."
00:47:08,00:47:10,"So, right, because there are lots of theories,"
00:47:10,00:47:11,"one is that he died of a swelling of the brain,"
00:47:11,00:47:13,which I think is what was the official finding
00:47:13,00:47:14,from the inquiry.
00:47:14,00:47:15,"Yeah, I think the brain definitely did swell,"
00:47:15,00:47:16,but it was as if it was wine.
00:47:16,00:47:19,"Well, is it because he was so, so, so fit?"
00:47:19,00:47:20,"He got rid of all fat,"
00:47:20,00:47:22,so there was no subcutaneous fat on his body at all.
00:47:22,00:47:24,That could be a problem.
00:47:24,00:47:26,"So, this was his routine when he died, right?"
00:47:26,00:47:29,"He drank liquidized steak and cow's blood every morning,"
00:47:29,00:47:30,then he ran seven miles...
00:47:30,00:47:31,"Wait, wait, wait."
00:47:31,00:47:31,Goldfish steak?
00:47:31,00:47:32,Goldfish steak.
00:47:32,00:47:39,"Then he would run seven miles with his Great Dane dog,"
00:47:39,00:47:42,"some of it backwards, some of it up the side of trees."
00:47:42,00:47:44,"Checked out, yeah."
00:47:44,00:47:46,And he was just too fit.
00:47:46,00:47:47,"Also, there's another theory"
00:47:47,00:47:49,that he didn't have any sweat glands.
00:47:49,00:47:50,"He didn't have any sweat glands,"
00:47:50,00:47:51,because he'd had them...
00:47:51,00:47:53,"And this is the idea that he died of heat,"
00:47:53,00:47:54,"like overheating,"
00:47:54,00:47:58,because he'd had his armpit glands removed out of vanity.
00:47:58,00:47:59,And let this be a lesson to the vein
00:47:59,00:48:02,that he thought that sweating made him look bad on screen.
00:48:02,00:48:05,"And then I found this most plausible theory about his death,"
00:48:05,00:48:08,because he'd had a brain swelling a few weeks early.
00:48:08,00:48:10,"Well, no one knows, really, no one knows what killed him."
00:48:10,00:48:12,But almost all your sweat comes out of the rest of you?
00:48:12,00:48:14,"Yes, I think he would just have probably overheated anyway."
00:48:14,00:48:16,It was a very hot day.
00:48:16,00:48:18,And he had this habit of whenever he was getting excited
00:48:18,00:48:20,"talking about a project of like doing, acting out,"
00:48:20,00:48:21,the whole film.
00:48:21,00:48:23,So the person who was with him said he'd literally acted out
00:48:23,00:48:26,the martial arts of an entire film that he was planning to do.
00:48:26,00:48:27,Can you emergency get rid of the heat?
00:48:27,00:48:29,"Like, can you just drool a lot?"
00:48:29,00:48:33,"Like, is there to get that, to get, yeah, just the liquid out of you?"
00:48:33,00:48:34,What kind of cold bath maybe?
00:48:34,00:48:35,"I don't know, but it's a shame,"
00:48:35,00:48:37,because we never got to find out
00:48:37,00:48:39,"whether he achieved one thing he wanted to do,"
00:48:39,00:48:41,"which was he, well, first of all,"
00:48:41,00:48:43,he was experimenting with electro-shocking himself.
00:48:43,00:48:46,"So in his sleep, he like ran electricity through his muscles"
00:48:46,00:48:48,to fine tune his reflexes.
00:48:48,00:48:50,"And he said that by the end of the year,"
00:48:50,00:48:52,he was going to be able to drive his fingers
00:48:52,00:48:55,right up to the middle knuckle through pine planks.
00:48:55,00:48:55,Wow.
00:48:55,00:48:58,And we never will know if he could do that
00:48:58,00:49:00,with just one finger through a plank of wood.
00:49:00,00:49:02,It's a shame I didn't come through the coffin lid.
00:49:02,00:49:03,Just kidding.
00:49:03,00:49:11,"I need to wrap this up, guys."
00:49:11,00:49:12,We've got to the end of our show.
