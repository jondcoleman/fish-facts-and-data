00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.080
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish,

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:19.280
 a weekly podcast this week coming to you live from Gothenburg!

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:22.280
 [cheering]

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:24.680
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:29.160
 I am sitting here with Anna Tyshinski, Andrew Hunter Murray and James Harkin,

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.920
 and once again we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:38.040
 from the last seven days and in no particular order, here we go!

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.520
 Starting with fact number one, and that is Andy.

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:47.240
 My fact is that the novel Dune, one of the greatest sci-fi novels ever,

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:54.280
 was rejected 20 times before being printed by a publisher who specialised in car repair manuals.

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:55.600
 [laughter]

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:02.360
 Because this is the book festival here in Gothenburg, one of the themes this year is space,

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:04.320
 this is about a book about space.

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.080
 Take it into consideration that we only have an hour, can you explain what Dune is?

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:10.880
 Oh, it's so great.

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:14.840
 It's a sci-fi novel, it's set on the desert planet of Arrakis,

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:18.040
 and it's all about the rise of a young messiah, or is he?

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:23.480
 Paula Trady's, and of course there's the Harkinen family, and there are giant worms,

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:28.080
 and it's a fantastic work of 60s sci-fi, you know.

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.200
 Frank Herbert, right?

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:34.720
 Frank Herbert was the author, and it had been serialised in a magazine, but it's really long,

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:38.720
 I mean it's really long Dune, and it was way too long to be a book, according to most publishers,

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:43.240
 you've got to look at it, and no one wanted to print it even in three volumes, they just said no thanks.

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:48.440
 So he got lots of rejections, and then he met a guy called Sterling E. Lanier of Chilton Books,

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:52.720
 and they specialised in car repair manuals, and they had some magazines as well,

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:57.200
 like Jeweler's Circular, and Dry Good's Economist, so...

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:02.480
 Is that like just a Good's Economist magazine, but it's very dry?

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:03.480
 It's very dry.

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:06.160
 No jokes in there at all.

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:09.600
 And they had done some sci-fi books before, it wasn't their first, some sources online

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:12.080
 say it's the first time they did, they had a little line in sci-fi.

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:16.520
 They've recently kind of bought another publisher, hadn't they, called Greenberg Publisher,

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:22.280
 and Greenberg was a sci-fi publisher, and that had been started by a guy called Martin Greenberg,

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:26.760
 who was also the first publisher of Isaac Kassimov's Foundation Trilogy.

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.920
 So they did have a little bit of background on that.

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:33.400
 But it wasn't a success, even with that little bit of effect around it.

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:37.520
 Sales were so bad that Lanier was sacked a year later, so for all the publishing people

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:41.520
 who are in the room today, don't take risks, is the message.

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:45.000
 I remember when you read this book Andy, because you did it on a no such thing as a fish tour

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.200
 when we went to Australia, and Andy's one of those people when he starts a book he needs to finish it,

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:53.560
 and this book has what, like six appendix, appendices, appendices at the end.

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:57.800
 I used to be sat next to Andy on the plane, and it's a long flight to Australia,

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:01.920
 and I got zero chat from him, he was the most dull man on tour.

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:06.440
 Those were the days, weren't they, when Andy didn't talk to us.

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:10.720
 I've actually started reading it this week, and I've got 40 pages in,

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:15.520
 and I'll be honest, I am one of those people that doesn't have to finish every book that I read.

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:19.200
 Would you say it's more or less exciting than a car repair manual?

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:25.040
 Oh that's interesting, because I've never read a car repair manual, even though I've owned many cars.

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:27.960
 Right, yeah, fair enough. Do you know, James, you'll hate this.

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:34.120
 James has a big fear of mushrooms, but there is an origin story to this whole June saga,

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:41.080
 which is that Frank Herbert loved studying fungi, and it was mushrooms that inspired him to do June.

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:46.520
 This is according to a book called Mycelium Running, the author of Paul Stamets sat down with him,

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:51.120
 and he basically said "The Magic Spice", which is in the book.

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:53.120
 So that's like the drug that they're all going through there.

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:57.120
 Exactly, that's the spores of the mushroom, the bending of space and time.

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:02.520
 That's him tripping on mushrooms, psychedelia, that's when he was off his tits.

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:09.640
 The giant worms, those are magics digesting the mushrooms that he would have witnessed in the process of studying them.

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:11.880
 So it's basically a tribute to the mushroom.

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:15.920
 And also he made huge contributions to the world of mushrooms, didn't he, Frank Herbert?

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:16.440
 What?

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:20.120
 As well as writing apparently unsuccessful book at the time,

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:25.080
 he apparently, and this is according to Paul Stamets, and who was really good mates with him from the 80s,

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:29.880
 he said that Frank was this avid mushroom collector and he got really upset when he would have to throw away

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:32.560
 less than perfect wild chanterelles.

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:37.320
 So instead he mixed it with water and salt and made a big slurry paste,

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:43.480
 and he spread it around the bottom of new fir trees and then a load of chanterelle mushrooms grew there.

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:50.200
 And this may not sound exciting at all to anyone here or me, but to mushroom people, to mycologists,

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:52.920
 they had no idea that mushrooms could grow at the base of young trees.

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:58.280
 So he discovered that by placing a slurry of old mushrooms at the bottom of a young tree,

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:00.120
 you could make some new mushrooms.

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:04.120
 Wow, that does sound like an important contribution to me.

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:06.200
 Yeah, yeah, and more important than June, maybe?

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:07.400
 Yeah, definitely.

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:10.760
 Wow, 40 pages in, I would say yes.

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:13.880
 Well, 900 pages in, I can tell you.

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:19.400
 And the other cool thing about Dune, so it's set on a deserty planet, it's all very, very sandy,

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:25.400
 and he was inspired to write this in part by some real life dunes, so you can visit.

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:30.440
 I think, in fact, they run tourist visits to the dunes of Florence, Oregon,

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:34.360
 and they were threatening to overrun the city in the early 20th century.

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:36.120
 Yeah, he hated these sand dunes, didn't he?

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:40.040
 Well, the sand dunes were widely hated because they were encroaching on the city, they'd move,

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:45.800
 and he was researching a program by the U.S. Department of Agriculture,

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:50.520
 and they were fixing huge grasses into these dunes to stabilize them, European beach grass,

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:53.800
 it's called, and it's got very deep roots, it locks the dunes in place.

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:58.040
 And the plot of Dune is about this desert planet and how it can be turned green again.

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:01.880
 It's exactly, and over the course of the novels, slight spoiler,

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:05.400
 the planet goes from desert to green, and then back to desert,

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:09.960
 and guess what's happening in the desert now in Florence, Oregon?

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:11.320
 Giant worms?

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:13.320
 No.

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:15.400
 They are now trying to get rid of these grasses,

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:18.600
 which they introduced as an invasive species a hundred years ago,

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:20.760
 because they're messing up with the ecology of the region.

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:23.640
 So, wow, the same thing is happening all over again.

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:25.480
 It's a premonition book, basically.

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:26.360
 Kind of, yeah.

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:29.800
 Gops, you're telling me humans introduced a new species to try and fix stuff,

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:32.440
 and it actually went even more wrong than it was before.

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:35.000
 That astonishes me.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.440
 It's amazing, how many copies did you say, Andy?

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:42.440
 So, it's like 14 million, 20 million, it's a big, big, big seller, right?

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:43.960
 It's had a huge cultural impact.

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:47.960
 I was trying to find out a few things of where it's led into pop culture and so on.

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:53.960
 There's a great story that Iron Maiden, the band, they named a song Dune,

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:55.960
 and it was inspired entirely by the book,

00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:59.400
 but they had to ask, or they wanted to ask, permission from Frank Herbert

00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:01.400
 to say, "Would you give us your blessing?"

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:04.440
 And they got a statement back from him, a little message that said,

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:09.080
 "Frank Herbert doesn't like rock bands, particularly heavy rock bands,

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:12.200
 and especially bands like Iron Maiden."

00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:18.440
 And so they had to change it to the titles now, "To Tame a Land," if anyone knows that song.

00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:20.760
 Well, can I tell you, I am an Iron Maiden anecdote.

00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:24.600
 Me and Anna once went to a pub quiz with Bruce Dickinson from Iron Maiden,

00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:26.040
 he's the lead singer.

00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:27.880
 And we sat with him through the whole quiz.

00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:29.960
 We did the quiz, I think we won the quiz, in fact.

00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:32.920
 And Anna was sat with Bruce the whole night and chatting to him or whatever.

00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:35.000
 And the next morning I said, "What did you think?

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:36.280
 Bruce is a nice guy, right?"

00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:37.800
 And Anna said, "Oh, yeah."

00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:40.040
 Said, "Have you not heard of Iron Maiden?"

00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:42.920
 And she said, "Oh, I thought that was a made-up band."

00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:51.720
 I thought that Iron Maiden only existed in that song that goes,

00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:55.640
 "Listen to Iron Maiden, baby."

00:07:55.640 --> 00:07:57.880
 Teenage shirt band.

00:07:57.880 --> 00:07:58.280
 Yeah.

00:07:58.280 --> 00:08:01.560
 I thought Teenage Dark like the song, "Invented Iron Maiden."

00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:03.880
 It was astonishing, my love, that I did a pub quiz with him.

00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:04.440
 Amazing.

00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:04.760
 Yeah.

00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:05.400
 Wow.

00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:06.040
 Wow.

00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:08.760
 Frank Herbert had some gigs before his June breakthrough,

00:08:08.760 --> 00:08:10.920
 and he was a wine critic for a while.

00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:11.640
 What's that you see?

00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:15.880
 And he was a very, very assiduous, whatever he did, he was very devoted.

00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:18.120
 I think this is why June is 19 million pages long,

00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:20.200
 it's because he really researches everything.

00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:21.240
 So it was a wine critic.

00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:24.840
 He not only insisted on being trained up on knowledge of all wine,

00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:27.480
 he insisted on being trained to make wine himself,

00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:30.280
 which actually is quite suspicious and is what I would insist on as well,

00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:31.800
 by being a wine critic.

00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:33.480
 But yeah, and he was a wine critic,

00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:37.080
 and then he was a speech writer for a Republican senator,

00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:40.120
 who I tried to find, he was called Guy Corden.

00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:44.680
 It was in 1955, and I did a troll of the newspaper archives

00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:50.120
 looking for Guy Corden's name being paired with worms or mushrooms or space.

00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:50.840
 Nothing.

00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:51.960
 Nothing, nothing.

00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:55.160
 He was very anti-Soviet, wasn't he?

00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:58.520
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, he was part of that kind of McCarthyism

00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:00.360
 where they're trying to root out all the commies.

00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:02.760
 I think he was a distant cousin of Joseph McCarthy.

00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:04.840
 That is Herbert was, yeah.

00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:05.720
 Exactly, yeah, yeah.

00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:06.520
 Was he?

00:09:06.520 --> 00:09:07.000
 Yeah, he was.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.680
 And you see that, I think, in some of the novels, don't you?

00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:15.800
 There's kind of an anti-communist angle to it, I believe so, yeah.

00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:20.040
 So, and the movies, obviously, we've all watched the June movies.

00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:22.200
 I watched the David Lynch one this week.

00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:23.560
 The big one.

00:09:23.560 --> 00:09:24.680
 The big one.

00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:25.800
 That was, like, 1984.

00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:29.720
 Yeah, so there's the massive ones that have been coming out in the last year or two.

00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:32.040
 By 1984, David Lynch shot a version.

00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:35.640
 And it's weird, I would say.

00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:38.200
 That's so odd for David Lynch.

00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:43.880
 But weirdly, it's just not quite weird enough to be David Lynch.

00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:48.280
 So it's like in that uncanny valley of not being weird enough to be weird.

00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:49.400
 It's really, really strange.

00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:51.880
 But they filmed it in Mexico.

00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:55.960
 And it was in an area where they had lots of rocks and plants and stuff like that.

00:09:55.960 --> 00:09:59.160
 But they needed it to be like June, where none of these things existed.

00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:05.320
 So apparently they spent two months stripping all of the plants, all of the animals in this area,

00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:06.600
 so they would look like June.

00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:07.640
 Oh my God.

00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:11.400
 Why don't you just go to Namibia or somewhere, which has vast rolling sand?

00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:13.320
 Probably a tax thing.

00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:13.960
 Tax thing.

00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:18.040
 Yeah, so some very famous names in the movie, Sting the Musicians in it.

00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:21.560
 And one other person who's in it is Patrick Stewart of Star Trek.

00:10:21.560 --> 00:10:22.600
 It's so weird.

00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:22.920
 Yeah, right.

00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:27.480
 Honestly, like you watch it and suddenly Captain whatever's called comes in.

00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:29.320
 But you know what's even weirder about that?

00:10:29.320 --> 00:10:30.840
 This is why it's so weird.

00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:32.840
 David Lynch hired Patrick Stewart.

00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:36.360
 And then when Patrick Stewart showed up, he went, this is the wrong Patrick Stewart.

00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:38.360
 He got the wrong card.

00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:40.360
 Patrick Stewart, Captain Picard, was never meant to be in it.

00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:42.760
 There's another actor called Patrick Stewart.

00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:44.440
 And it went to the wrong person.

00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:45.800
 But was he already a sci-fi...

00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:47.400
 He was already doing stuff.

00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:48.520
 No, I don't think so at that point.

00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:49.800
 No, he was like a theatre guy.

00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:51.240
 Yeah, he was a theatre guy.

00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:55.720
 And so then he got on to the set and did exactly what you did with Bruce Dickinson,

00:10:55.720 --> 00:10:58.840
 which is he was introduced to Sting and had no idea who he was.

00:10:58.840 --> 00:11:00.600
 Because I do what else do you do?

00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:01.720
 And he's like, oh, I'm a musician.

00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:03.000
 He's like, oh, that's really cool.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:03.960
 I'll check your stuff out.

00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:05.160
 That's exciting.

00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:06.280
 What's it called?

00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:08.040
 And he's like, we're the police.

00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:09.880
 And he thought, oh, that's really nice.

00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:13.160
 An armed service to put together a band.

00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:15.080
 And you probably play fairs and stuff.

00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:16.360
 Yeah, that's so good.

00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:18.920
 This first film that was released.

00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:21.160
 So you saw it last night, though?

00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:21.800
 Yes, I did, yeah.

00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:25.320
 Was it easy to follow, hard to follow, somewhere between...?

00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:26.840
 It was hard to follow, I'll be honest.

00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:31.160
 It's quite baffling, because they try and crowbar a big book into a sort of longish film.

00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:32.920
 But that's a real squeeze.

00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:35.000
 It is such a complicated film to watch, supposedly,

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:40.840
 that when the first film came out, audiences in cinemas were given a small printed glossary of

00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:44.520
 terms to help them understand what was going on.

00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:46.600
 I could really have done with that, I'll be honest.

00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:48.680
 I've seen an original copy of these things.

00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:50.920
 The typeface is so small, but in a dark cinema,

00:11:50.920 --> 00:11:54.840
 you would be looking for ages for the term "Muadib" or whatever it is.

00:11:54.840 --> 00:11:55.240
 Yeah.

00:11:55.240 --> 00:11:57.800
 And by the time you look back, it would be another scene.

00:11:57.800 --> 00:11:59.400
 It just seemed like a terrible idea.

00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:01.400
 I think they put the lights on before.

00:12:01.400 --> 00:12:04.520
 And when everyone had a quick read, familiarize yourselves with what's coming up.

00:12:04.520 --> 00:12:05.880
 What, memorize the glossary?

00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:08.680
 Well, just get a brief idea.

00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:12.440
 So we've got the modern Dune movies, and then there was the David Lynch in 1984.

00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:15.240
 But there was meant to be another one in 1974,

00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:19.080
 which was going to be directed by a guy called Alejandro Jodorowsky.

00:12:19.080 --> 00:12:23.560
 And he basically said, "I want to make the full version of this."

00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:26.600
 So it was going to be a 10 to 14 hour long movie.

00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:28.920
 He had an extraordinary cast lined up.

00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:34.920
 Everyone from Orson Welles, David Carradine, who was Kill Bill, Geraldine Chaplin.

00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:38.040
 Orson Welles, he managed to convince to come onto the film by saying,

00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:41.000
 "I will pay you really well, but also I'll get your favorite gourmet chef

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:42.840
 to prepare your meals every single day."

00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:43.880
 And he was like, "Great, I'm in."

00:12:43.880 --> 00:12:45.240
 Yeah, that works.

00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:46.360
 But it never happened.

00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:50.440
 And he had a bit of a fallout with Frank Herbert over the writing process of it.

00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:55.000
 But this director believed that he didn't need to talk to Herbert,

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:58.280
 because Herbert had extracted the novel initially

00:12:58.280 --> 00:13:01.160
 from the collected unconscious of our world.

00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:04.840
 And so it was plucked from some soup of ideas.

00:13:04.840 --> 00:13:09.160
 That's a good anti-copyright argument, isn't it, when you're taken to court?

00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:11.000
 Well, it was all lingering in the air.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.960
 It was an enormous kind of behemoth of a thing.

00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:16.040
 And unsprising, it never got made.

00:13:16.040 --> 00:13:18.200
 But he hired Salvador Dali to be in it.

00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:21.160
 And Dali insisted on only being in this film

00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:23.800
 if he could become the highest-paid Hollywood actor ever.

00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:26.040
 I think he must have been doing the whole thing as a joke.

00:13:26.040 --> 00:13:28.600
 But so Frank Herbert agreed and said,

00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:34.200
 "Fine, I will pay you $100,000 an hour in this film I'm doing."

00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:38.360
 And then he reduced Dali's scenes so that he only needed him for an hour.

00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:40.360
 And he set up the rest with a robotic...

00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:41.880
 It says a robot look-alike.

00:13:41.880 --> 00:13:43.240
 Now, a robotic look-alike.

00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:45.080
 I don't know if that means a look-alike to Dali,

00:13:45.080 --> 00:13:47.000
 who was also kind of a robotic actor,

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.360
 or if they actually got a robot who looked like Dali to do the rest.

00:13:50.360 --> 00:13:53.960
 In those days, that's just going to be a microwave of the mustache, isn't it?

00:13:53.960 --> 00:14:04.200
 I need to move us on, guys.

00:14:04.200 --> 00:14:08.280
 It is time for fact number two, and that is James.

00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:12.440
 Okay, my fact this week is that the largest known star

00:14:12.440 --> 00:14:15.560
 is 3,000 times wider than the sun,

00:14:15.560 --> 00:14:18.760
 and is coincidentally called "WOW!"

00:14:18.760 --> 00:14:29.800
 Yes, so this is WOHG64, which I am choosing to pronounce "WOW!"

00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:34.680
 And it actually gets its name because it was discovered by astronomers

00:14:34.680 --> 00:14:38.840
 Bent Vesteland, Niels Olander, and Larga Heddon,

00:14:38.840 --> 00:14:40.600
 who I think might be Swedish, actually.

00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:43.000
 They're certainly from this part of the world.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:46.520
 And the first letter of each of the names is WOH,

00:14:46.520 --> 00:14:47.880
 and that's how it gets its name.

00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:50.520
 It actually, it kind of works if you mix it up, like, "HOW!"

00:14:50.520 --> 00:14:54.040
 For the size of "OWW!"

00:14:54.040 --> 00:15:01.000
 Yeah, this is amazing.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:02.760
 So, yeah, and it's a massive old star.

00:15:03.960 --> 00:15:08.280
 It's, if you can imagine the sun as a tiny grain of sand,

00:15:08.280 --> 00:15:12.280
 then this star is about the size of a basketball.

00:15:12.280 --> 00:15:13.160
 What?

00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:13.880
 No, "WOW!"

00:15:13.880 --> 00:15:18.200
 I walk into the curry.

00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:23.000
 And it's kind of interesting because it's much cooler than you would imagine.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:24.440
 I mean, it's cooler in that way,

00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:27.320
 but cooler, as in it's not very hot,

00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:29.080
 than you would expect from this kind of star.

00:15:29.080 --> 00:15:31.000
 We don't really know why,

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:35.560
 and it's kind of an variance with the current theories of how stars are made.

00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:37.480
 So that, for scientists,

00:15:37.480 --> 00:15:39.000
 we find that really, really interesting

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:42.520
 when something doesn't quite fit in with our rules.

00:15:42.520 --> 00:15:45.400
 Something else is going on that we can discover.

00:15:45.400 --> 00:15:47.480
 It's one of those things like the mushrooms at the bottom of the tree.

00:15:47.480 --> 00:15:48.920
 You know, it's really, really exciting

00:15:48.920 --> 00:15:50.680
 for the people who know about how stars are made.

00:15:50.680 --> 00:15:53.800
 And then for a lot of us, it's like, "Okay, good on you."

00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:55.480
 Another point of analogy with it,

00:15:55.480 --> 00:15:57.720
 if it was placed where our sun is,

00:15:57.720 --> 00:16:00.200
 we would all be inside it now.

00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:02.040
 It will come out as far as Jupiter, in fact.

00:16:02.040 --> 00:16:05.160
 It will come out way, way, way, way, way further than the Earth at the moment.

00:16:05.160 --> 00:16:06.760
 But if it's not that hot, sounds like we'll be fine.

00:16:06.760 --> 00:16:10.600
 Just a nice warmth.

00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:11.640
 Yeah, exactly.

00:16:11.640 --> 00:16:15.080
 I like that the instrument that we use largely to observe it

00:16:15.080 --> 00:16:17.720
 is called the Very Large Telescope.

00:16:17.720 --> 00:16:19.960
 Yes, science is great.

00:16:19.960 --> 00:16:22.840
 Isn't it? Because we've got an extremely large telescope, haven't we?

00:16:22.840 --> 00:16:26.120
 And I think there's one bigger than that.

00:16:26.120 --> 00:16:27.880
 I'm working on, I can't remember what it is,

00:16:27.880 --> 00:16:29.960
 it's not the enormously large telescope.

00:16:29.960 --> 00:16:31.640
 Oh, it's the Very Hungry Telescope, that's it.

00:16:31.640 --> 00:16:36.440
 The Very Large Telescope, it's a parameter that they're using to view...

00:16:36.440 --> 00:16:37.320
 Whoa.

00:16:37.320 --> 00:16:40.680
 It's strong enough that it would be able to make out a tennis ball

00:16:40.680 --> 00:16:43.400
 that is on the Opera House in Oslo from this room.

00:16:43.400 --> 00:16:46.040
 But that's how, yeah, how good they are.

00:16:46.040 --> 00:16:47.480
 Well, that puts it in context for me.

00:16:47.480 --> 00:16:52.600
 I was hoping for the people of Gothenburg

00:16:52.600 --> 00:16:54.760
 that they might know where Oslo is.

00:16:54.760 --> 00:16:56.520
 I couldn't even point to Oslo from here.

00:16:56.520 --> 00:16:59.640
 So, yeah, that is amazing.

00:16:59.640 --> 00:17:02.200
 What's, and that's the, did you say interferometer?

00:17:02.200 --> 00:17:03.560
 It's an interferometer, yeah.

00:17:03.560 --> 00:17:04.280
 I'd never heard of that.

00:17:04.280 --> 00:17:05.080
 Well, let's move up.

00:17:05.080 --> 00:17:11.720
 Have you guys, do you know what the name of the most distant planet

00:17:11.720 --> 00:17:14.760
 that we have found in the far reaches of the Solar System is called?

00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:15.480
 No, no.

00:17:15.480 --> 00:17:17.000
 It's called Far Out.

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:17.400
 Hang on.

00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:18.200
 Oh, really?

00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:20.120
 It's called Far Out, or at least it was.

00:17:20.120 --> 00:17:22.200
 It was only the record holder for two months

00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:23.800
 before they found something even further,

00:17:23.800 --> 00:17:25.960
 which they called Far Far Out.

00:17:25.960 --> 00:17:28.120
 Very cool names.

00:17:29.160 --> 00:17:33.400
 But some suns, or some stars, sorry, are actually really not that hot.

00:17:33.400 --> 00:17:36.040
 I get quite excited when you learn about stuff in the universe

00:17:36.040 --> 00:17:39.000
 that you can sort of imagine making contact with.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:42.440
 Like, in fact, I was saying to James earlier

00:17:42.440 --> 00:17:44.760
 that there's a fact I read once that is,

00:17:44.760 --> 00:17:48.440
 if you fell into a black hole that's a thousand times bigger than the sun,

00:17:48.440 --> 00:17:49.880
 theoretically you would survive.

00:17:49.880 --> 00:17:51.480
 Now, obviously, you wouldn't for lots of reasons,

00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:53.240
 but it wouldn't crush you theoretically.

00:17:53.240 --> 00:17:55.320
 And I just liked that because it's like,

00:17:55.320 --> 00:17:58.200
 wow, me, a tiny human on Earth could survive that.

00:17:58.200 --> 00:17:59.960
 And I was amazed to read equally

00:17:59.960 --> 00:18:01.640
 that there are these things called brown dwarfs,

00:18:01.640 --> 00:18:04.360
 which are, they're often called failed stars.

00:18:04.360 --> 00:18:07.960
 So they're stars that they're not big enough

00:18:07.960 --> 00:18:09.880
 to sustain nuclear fusion at their core.

00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:11.560
 But their surface temperatures are so low,

00:18:11.560 --> 00:18:13.960
 some of them are as low as about like a mug of tea.

00:18:13.960 --> 00:18:17.560
 So if you touched it, it would feel like it's a hand warmer.

00:18:17.560 --> 00:18:18.360
 That's cool.

00:18:18.360 --> 00:18:19.240
 Yeah, it's not crazy.

00:18:19.240 --> 00:18:21.240
 They can get hot, though, mugs of tea, can't they?

00:18:21.240 --> 00:18:25.080
 Yeah, this is like a mug of tea when you've left it too long.

00:18:25.080 --> 00:18:25.560
 Oh, really?

00:18:25.560 --> 00:18:27.000
 A mug of tea when you sip it and you go,

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:28.680
 oh, bollocks, you have to chuck it away.

00:18:28.680 --> 00:18:33.000
 You know, those kind of failed stars,

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:36.200
 if they had a bit more mass, they would become stars, right?

00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:40.200
 And the level that you have to get to to become a star,

00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:42.680
 that area is called the genes instability,

00:18:42.680 --> 00:18:46.200
 which I think sounds like something a bit rude in your trousers.

00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:51.080
 Oh, got a bit of a genes instability going on.

00:18:51.080 --> 00:18:51.800
 Don't mind me.

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:58.600
 There are some stars on there which are kind of rogue loose stars.

00:18:58.600 --> 00:18:59.160
 Oh, yeah.

00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:00.120
 They're hyper dense.

00:19:00.120 --> 00:19:02.120
 They're about the size of our sun,

00:19:02.120 --> 00:19:05.400
 but they many, many, many thousands of times the mass.

00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:07.480
 And they're just barreling loose through space.

00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:07.640
 Wow.

00:19:07.640 --> 00:19:09.880
 As in they're not in a proper system.

00:19:09.880 --> 00:19:10.680
 Oh, that's amazing.

00:19:10.680 --> 00:19:11.160
 Rebels.

00:19:11.160 --> 00:19:11.960
 Like they are.

00:19:11.960 --> 00:19:16.200
 Like her in Street Fighter, like one of those Ryu balls.

00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:17.000
 What?

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:18.600
 You know, I told you.

00:19:18.600 --> 00:19:21.400
 I didn't, again, I've said it before and I'll say it again.

00:19:21.400 --> 00:19:26.760
 I don't think it needed that layer of really nice analogy on top.

00:19:26.760 --> 00:19:28.920
 It's just like some paint pictures, Andy.

00:19:28.920 --> 00:19:31.640
 But it is, it's just like those.

00:19:31.640 --> 00:19:34.840
 It's a random loose fireball just barreling through.

00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:36.440
 And I don't, there's never been one.

00:19:36.440 --> 00:19:38.520
 I think there's end of our solar system or anything like that.

00:19:38.520 --> 00:19:39.080
 Okay.

00:19:39.080 --> 00:19:41.400
 But if one does come this way, we're knackered.

00:19:41.400 --> 00:19:41.800
 Oh, yes.

00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:42.920
 Yeah, yeah.

00:19:42.920 --> 00:19:45.240
 Well, what's quite sweet about stars is,

00:19:45.240 --> 00:19:47.720
 aside from these sort of Clint Eastwood loner stars,

00:19:47.720 --> 00:19:53.320
 they're basically all or I think estimated 85% of them come in pairs.

00:19:53.320 --> 00:19:54.840
 And I actually find it amazing.

00:19:54.840 --> 00:19:58.280
 If you're looking at the sky and you see a star, it's probably two stars.

00:19:58.280 --> 00:20:00.920
 And if you look through a really powerful telescope, you'll see two.

00:20:00.920 --> 00:20:04.040
 So yeah, 85% of stars, binary stars, not our sun.

00:20:04.040 --> 00:20:07.400
 It's one of our suns on the special ones, which is on its own, I think.

00:20:07.400 --> 00:20:10.360
 And mostly I think their primary star and then companion,

00:20:10.360 --> 00:20:13.960
 which is like a smaller guy rotating around it.

00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:16.760
 And the only way we know how big any stars are,

00:20:16.760 --> 00:20:20.520
 I like the only way we know how big this largest known woe star is,

00:20:20.520 --> 00:20:22.120
 is because they're in pairs.

00:20:22.120 --> 00:20:25.000
 And so you take the Barry Center, which is...

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:27.160
 The Barry Center.

00:20:27.160 --> 00:20:27.800
 Yeah, yeah.

00:20:27.800 --> 00:20:29.240
 It's not an EastEnders thing.

00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:29.720
 It's like...

00:20:29.720 --> 00:20:33.320
 We've performed at the Barry Center since South Wales, isn't it?

00:20:33.320 --> 00:20:37.000
 Yeah, all stars rotate around South Wales.

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:42.360
 The Barry Center is the center around which the two stars in the binary system rotate.

00:20:42.360 --> 00:20:45.240
 And so you measure their distance from that and you watch them rotating.

00:20:45.240 --> 00:20:48.040
 And you hopefully watch one eclipse the other from Earth.

00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:51.000
 And you see kind of how long one takes to cross the other.

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:53.080
 And that's how we know how big they are.

00:20:53.080 --> 00:20:58.360
 So solitary stars, the only way we know how big a star that's on its own is,

00:20:58.360 --> 00:21:03.080
 is that we compare its brightness to the brightness of these binary stars whose size we know.

00:21:03.080 --> 00:21:05.160
 And we say, okay, well, we guess it's about that size.

00:21:05.160 --> 00:21:06.360
 How interesting.

00:21:06.360 --> 00:21:07.880
 Except the suns, we're really close to the sun.

00:21:07.880 --> 00:21:09.320
 So we can measure that with a T measure.

00:21:11.320 --> 00:21:15.320
 So it is amazing thinking of just how different everything else is to here.

00:21:15.320 --> 00:21:16.520
 Okay.

00:21:16.520 --> 00:21:20.120
 Because here we have conference centers, and we have book festivals,

00:21:20.120 --> 00:21:21.880
 and we have wine glasses, and we have tables.

00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:22.680
 And I'm just pointing at things I've seen out front.

00:21:22.680 --> 00:21:23.880
 We've got Dune.

00:21:23.880 --> 00:21:24.600
 We've got Dune.

00:21:24.600 --> 00:21:26.440
 I don't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing.

00:21:26.440 --> 00:21:30.840
 But get this, 99.9% of all matter that we have observed in space

00:21:30.840 --> 00:21:33.000
 is not solid, all liquid, all gas.

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:33.960
 It's plasma.

00:21:33.960 --> 00:21:34.120
 Okay.

00:21:34.120 --> 00:21:36.600
 Because that's what the state of matter that's found today.

00:21:37.480 --> 00:21:39.640
 There's loose ions, electrons, and there's a kind of soup.

00:21:39.640 --> 00:21:41.720
 So our sun is plasma.

00:21:41.720 --> 00:21:46.120
 There's a bit of plasma on Earth, lightning bolts, and neon signs.

00:21:46.120 --> 00:21:47.160
 Oh, yeah.

00:21:47.160 --> 00:21:53.000
 And those two things, 99.9% of the universe is plasma.

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:53.960
 On TVs.

00:21:53.960 --> 00:21:54.680
 Plasma as well.

00:21:54.680 --> 00:21:57.640
 Yes.

00:21:57.640 --> 00:22:02.040
 I think it's the same stuff.

00:22:02.040 --> 00:22:03.560
 I think it might be the same.

00:22:03.560 --> 00:22:04.760
 Is it the same?

00:22:04.760 --> 00:22:05.320
 That's a good point.

00:22:05.320 --> 00:22:05.800
 I don't know.

00:22:06.840 --> 00:22:09.000
 That's, you know, shooting stars are multicolored.

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:12.600
 When you see a shooting star, but you need to look really hard,

00:22:12.600 --> 00:22:15.080
 which is hard to do because obviously they appear and then they just appear quickly.

00:22:15.080 --> 00:22:17.960
 But it's because when, so they're obviously a meteor flying through the Earth's atmosphere

00:22:17.960 --> 00:22:19.240
 and they're burning up in the atmosphere.

00:22:19.240 --> 00:22:23.160
 But because the meteors are made of lots of different elements,

00:22:23.160 --> 00:22:26.200
 as they burn, they kind of react with the gases around them.

00:22:26.200 --> 00:22:29.640
 And they create like magnesium oxide or whatever,

00:22:29.640 --> 00:22:32.920
 or, you know, all the different oxides, which burn with different colors.

00:22:32.920 --> 00:22:34.760
 So if you look closely, you'll see bright blue.

00:22:34.760 --> 00:22:35.560
 They're bright purple.

00:22:35.560 --> 00:22:37.160
 Like fireworks, I guess, right?

00:22:37.160 --> 00:22:39.320
 They are a fire, a very quick firework.

00:22:39.320 --> 00:22:39.640
 Yeah.

00:22:39.640 --> 00:22:40.120
 Yeah.

00:22:40.120 --> 00:22:42.600
 But some animals, you know, who see, like pigeons,

00:22:42.600 --> 00:22:45.320
 see in more frames a second than we do, don't they?

00:22:45.320 --> 00:22:47.160
 So they probably, when they see a shooting star,

00:22:47.160 --> 00:22:48.840
 it's probably like fireworks there.

00:22:48.840 --> 00:22:52.360
 I'm not actually convinced that shooting stars exist, to be honest.

00:22:52.360 --> 00:22:53.560
 You never seen one?

00:22:53.560 --> 00:22:56.520
 Well, no, because my wife always sees them because there's one,

00:22:56.520 --> 00:22:57.960
 and I turn around and it's not there.

00:22:57.960 --> 00:23:02.600
 I think the only logical thing is that they don't exist and everyone's having me on.

00:23:02.600 --> 00:23:03.400
 Yeah.

00:23:03.400 --> 00:23:03.960
 Yeah.

00:23:03.960 --> 00:23:04.440
 A huge threat to them.

00:23:04.440 --> 00:23:05.560
 A huge threat to them.

00:23:05.560 --> 00:23:07.320
 Oh, sorry.

00:23:07.320 --> 00:23:12.280
 I've got some really exciting space news from the last couple of weeks.

00:23:12.280 --> 00:23:13.080
 Oh, yeah.

00:23:13.080 --> 00:23:13.720
 Go.

00:23:13.720 --> 00:23:17.320
 So there is a spacecraft that is going around the moons of Jupiter

00:23:17.320 --> 00:23:20.920
 because it's looking for life in our solar system.

00:23:20.920 --> 00:23:25.240
 And good news, we have found life in the solar system.

00:23:25.240 --> 00:23:27.480
 This probe has managed to find life.

00:23:27.480 --> 00:23:28.600
 We haven't, and it hasn't.

00:23:28.600 --> 00:23:30.280
 Are you breaking the news of, yeah.

00:23:30.280 --> 00:23:33.960
 Like, oh, they trusted you to have got the UMBC with this.

00:23:33.960 --> 00:23:35.240
 It's the 20th.

00:23:35.240 --> 00:23:40.120
 They were flying by and they pointed their telescope at a planet called Earth.

00:23:40.120 --> 00:23:45.160
 And they found that, yes, indeed, Earth is habitable.

00:23:45.160 --> 00:23:47.880
 That's so funny.

00:23:47.880 --> 00:23:50.600
 Obviously, it is important because it shows that it's working.

00:23:50.600 --> 00:23:50.840
 Yeah.

00:23:50.840 --> 00:23:51.240
 Right.

00:23:51.240 --> 00:23:54.280
 You know, if they point to Earth and it says this is what is habitable.

00:23:54.280 --> 00:23:55.720
 That is playing on easy mode.

00:23:55.720 --> 00:24:01.400
 My, I've got a neighbour who's got a really interesting space story.

00:24:01.400 --> 00:24:05.000
 So he's an artist and he did this really beautiful piece.

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:06.440
 That's our solar system.

00:24:06.440 --> 00:24:10.520
 And so I have a print of it in my son's room as well, Will's room.

00:24:10.520 --> 00:24:13.560
 And a guy in America who's one of the co-hosts of Radio Lab,

00:24:13.560 --> 00:24:17.160
 one of the massive podcasts, he had it on his wall in his son's room.

00:24:17.160 --> 00:24:18.200
 And he kept looking at it.

00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:22.760
 And Venus had a moon called Zuzvi, Z-O-O-Z-V-E.

00:24:22.760 --> 00:24:26.040
 But he was like, he knew science.

00:24:26.040 --> 00:24:28.040
 He knows that Venus doesn't have a moon.

00:24:28.040 --> 00:24:29.960
 So what the hell was going on there?

00:24:29.960 --> 00:24:31.480
 He started looking into it more and more.

00:24:31.480 --> 00:24:35.240
 And he got in touch with Alex, who is the illustrator, Alex Foster.

00:24:35.240 --> 00:24:38.680
 And Alex said, I just found it on some little slip of paper, right?

00:24:38.680 --> 00:24:40.760
 It turns out for a very brief moment,

00:24:40.760 --> 00:24:45.400
 a quasi-moon had been discovered going around Venus in 2002

00:24:45.400 --> 00:24:49.080
 and was given the name 2002-V-E.

00:24:49.080 --> 00:24:53.800
 But Alex misread it as Zuzvi and put it on this thing.

00:24:53.800 --> 00:24:58.120
 Now there are certain rules about when a quasi-moon can be named.

00:24:58.120 --> 00:25:00.280
 There's a planetary naming system that goes on.

00:25:00.280 --> 00:25:03.560
 One thing is you have to have had a paper or a book written about it.

00:25:03.560 --> 00:25:06.520
 So between 2002 and this being drawn,

00:25:06.520 --> 00:25:10.920
 and then this discovery by this Radio Lab guy, a paper had been written.

00:25:10.920 --> 00:25:12.920
 So officially it can now be named.

00:25:12.920 --> 00:25:15.160
 And it has been officially named Zuzvi.

00:25:15.160 --> 00:25:18.920
 So the picture is now accurate.

00:25:18.920 --> 00:25:23.240
 I remember finding a pill outside my house,

00:25:23.240 --> 00:25:27.160
 which I thought must have been some drug dealer or a dropper or something.

00:25:27.160 --> 00:25:29.160
 And it was called Z-O-M-G.

00:25:29.160 --> 00:25:31.480
 Like, OMG, but with a Z at the start.

00:25:31.480 --> 00:25:33.400
 And I put a picture of it on the Internet and said,

00:25:33.400 --> 00:25:35.000
 "Does anyone know what drug this is?"

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:37.160
 And apparently it just was 20 milligrams.

00:25:37.160 --> 00:25:40.120
 I have paracetamol.

00:25:40.120 --> 00:25:46.440
 I love you bringing up the police.

00:25:46.440 --> 00:25:47.880
 I found a drugs nest.

00:25:47.880 --> 00:25:50.840
 It's called Boots, and they have all sorts of stuff.

00:25:56.520 --> 00:26:00.280
 It is time for fact number three, and that is Anna.

00:26:00.280 --> 00:26:05.000
 My fact this week is that in 18th century Japan, you could eat vegetarian goose.

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:10.120
 Wow, and do you mean that the goose itself is not eating meat or...?

00:26:10.120 --> 00:26:13.720
 No, an actual vegetarian option.

00:26:13.720 --> 00:26:19.240
 In restaurants in 18th century Japan, this is just them being way ahead of their time.

00:26:19.240 --> 00:26:24.440
 I came across this in a book from 1790 called "Recipes from the Soy Garden."

00:26:24.440 --> 00:26:27.000
 Or I think it's finally been reproduced in English,

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:31.320
 and it's been titled "Recipes from the Garden of Paradise" or something.

00:26:31.320 --> 00:26:35.160
 And it's by a guy called Yuan Mei, who was China's most famous poet.

00:26:35.160 --> 00:26:37.320
 So you'd expect him to be writing recipe books.

00:26:37.320 --> 00:26:42.760
 And he had a recipe in there for mock roast goose.

00:26:42.760 --> 00:26:48.120
 And he said, "The way you made it was you wrap yam in tofu skin."

00:26:48.120 --> 00:26:49.480
 And that was it.

00:26:49.480 --> 00:26:52.360
 And I couldn't find many more details on how to do it.

00:26:52.360 --> 00:26:55.880
 By the way, as you get a load of yams, you kind of sculpt it into the shape of goose.

00:26:55.880 --> 00:26:59.000
 And then you wrap it in what's actually this thing called yuba,

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:00.440
 which is a really interesting ingredient.

00:27:00.440 --> 00:27:03.080
 But it's the skin you get on the top of soy milk.

00:27:03.080 --> 00:27:07.640
 So if you have normal dairy milk, then you have that delicious skin on the top of it.

00:27:07.640 --> 00:27:09.240
 Soy milk, same thing.

00:27:09.240 --> 00:27:12.200
 They would peel it off very carefully, hang it up,

00:27:12.200 --> 00:27:14.040
 and then allow more and more skin to form.

00:27:14.040 --> 00:27:17.000
 And that's a really crucial ingredient of its own.

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:19.240
 And you'd wrap the yam in that.

00:27:19.240 --> 00:27:22.040
 And actually they'd make some stuff just from that yuba, didn't they?

00:27:22.040 --> 00:27:23.480
 They'd make vegetarian stuff.

00:27:23.480 --> 00:27:27.000
 Because when it comes out, it's really sort of like plasticine,

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:29.320
 and you can mold it into any shape you want.

00:27:29.320 --> 00:27:32.120
 And so you could shape it into any meat you wanted.

00:27:32.120 --> 00:27:38.760
 So there were dishes like butter's chicken, butter's fish, butter's duck, molded pig's head,

00:27:38.760 --> 00:27:42.840
 molded ham, and they were all made out of this yuba that was just put into different shapes.

00:27:42.840 --> 00:27:43.880
 It's very cool.

00:27:43.880 --> 00:27:48.920
 I didn't realize that it was virtually invented, the idea of this fake meat,

00:27:48.920 --> 00:27:52.520
 as a transition to get you to just being a vegetarian.

00:27:52.520 --> 00:27:54.520
 It was like weaning you off the real deals.

00:27:54.520 --> 00:27:57.880
 So you would slowly get the sensation that you were eating this thing still.

00:27:57.880 --> 00:27:59.480
 But it wasn't what it was.

00:27:59.480 --> 00:28:02.200
 And then eventually you'd be like, "Well, yeah, I don't really fancy meat anymore."

00:28:02.200 --> 00:28:03.880
 And then you go straight to the vegetarian stuff.

00:28:03.880 --> 00:28:07.320
 But you are full vegetarian if you're eating yam in the shape of a goose.

00:28:07.320 --> 00:28:07.880
 I think that's fine.

00:28:07.880 --> 00:28:09.240
 You don't need to go any further.

00:28:09.240 --> 00:28:09.960
 That's fine.

00:28:09.960 --> 00:28:10.680
 Yes.

00:28:10.680 --> 00:28:14.680
 But sometimes you need the psychological reasoning to go, "Oh, I'm still having--

00:28:14.680 --> 00:28:17.640
 I guess like today, if you have an impossible burger or something,

00:28:17.640 --> 00:28:19.400
 it's like a transition to--

00:28:19.400 --> 00:28:19.640
 Yeah.

00:28:19.640 --> 00:28:22.280
 Because you still kind of want the taste of meat.

00:28:22.280 --> 00:28:22.840
 But you--

00:28:22.840 --> 00:28:23.160
 Yeah.

00:28:23.160 --> 00:28:23.640
 I know.

00:28:23.640 --> 00:28:24.760
 But I think you're there.

00:28:24.760 --> 00:28:25.880
 I really do.

00:28:25.880 --> 00:28:26.120
 Yeah.

00:28:26.120 --> 00:28:26.920
 It's okay.

00:28:26.920 --> 00:28:28.600
 Keep eating the yammy goose.

00:28:28.600 --> 00:28:29.080
 But I do.

00:28:29.080 --> 00:28:32.520
 And I just stuck on the fake meats now, which I really--

00:28:32.520 --> 00:28:35.640
 They're really not that sort of fascinating as well as pretty good.

00:28:35.640 --> 00:28:36.120
 A lot of them.

00:28:36.120 --> 00:28:38.280
 Anyway, one of the things--

00:28:38.280 --> 00:28:40.280
 Sorry, I've completely lost my train of thought.

00:28:40.280 --> 00:28:42.200
 Can I just quickly just add to that the old--

00:28:42.200 --> 00:28:43.080
 I'll get back.

00:28:43.080 --> 00:28:44.360
 We just got to sit inside of it.

00:28:44.360 --> 00:28:44.680
 Okay, sure.

00:28:44.680 --> 00:28:45.640
 I'll do it.

00:28:45.640 --> 00:28:46.040
 I'll do it.

00:28:46.040 --> 00:28:46.520
 I don't know.

00:28:46.520 --> 00:28:47.560
 I believe in you.

00:28:47.560 --> 00:28:48.280
 I'm doing it.

00:28:48.280 --> 00:28:50.040
 I have the pressures on--

00:28:50.040 --> 00:28:52.280
 I think if you had a bit more protein in your diet,

00:28:52.280 --> 00:28:54.200
 you wouldn't have this problem.

00:28:54.200 --> 00:28:57.640
 So all I was going to say was that it's almost all the way through history.

00:28:57.640 --> 00:28:59.960
 So tofu was invented at about 200 BC,

00:28:59.960 --> 00:29:01.480
 was when it started being invented.

00:29:01.480 --> 00:29:03.240
 It's almost all either religious reasons

00:29:03.240 --> 00:29:05.800
 or times extreme economic hardship,

00:29:05.800 --> 00:29:08.120
 where there just isn't any meat to go around.

00:29:08.120 --> 00:29:10.280
 And those are the two huge factors,

00:29:10.280 --> 00:29:12.440
 until recently when it's been more of a climatey thing.

00:29:12.440 --> 00:29:12.760
 Right.

00:29:12.760 --> 00:29:16.040
 But in the 1990s, Cuba had a big economic crisis.

00:29:16.600 --> 00:29:19.240
 And they made a thing that was steak,

00:29:19.240 --> 00:29:22.280
 but it was made from breaded and fried grapefruit rind.

00:29:22.280 --> 00:29:24.280
 And it was--

00:29:24.280 --> 00:29:25.000
 I mean, they had a lot of--

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:28.120
 Wow, an even less delicious part of a grapefruit,

00:29:28.120 --> 00:29:29.800
 which already is quite disgusting.

00:29:29.800 --> 00:29:32.600
 There was soy picadillo,

00:29:32.600 --> 00:29:34.600
 which I found described in the Havana Times,

00:29:34.600 --> 00:29:37.080
 as the worst ground meat-like substance

00:29:37.080 --> 00:29:40.600
 that any human beings ever tasted in the 20th century.

00:29:40.600 --> 00:29:41.160
 Wow.

00:29:41.160 --> 00:29:43.160
 So it is, yeah, doesn't always work.

00:29:43.160 --> 00:29:44.840
 In the Oxford Companions of Food,

00:29:44.840 --> 00:29:48.760
 which I think we've all dipped into from time to time in England,

00:29:48.760 --> 00:29:52.040
 is probably the Bible of facts about food.

00:29:52.040 --> 00:29:54.280
 When you go into the fake meat section,

00:29:54.280 --> 00:29:58.840
 they say that bread people is part of this whole thing.

00:29:58.840 --> 00:30:02.440
 And bread people is basically a human made out of bread.

00:30:02.440 --> 00:30:05.960
 And it seems a bit like a gingerbread man, right?

00:30:05.960 --> 00:30:07.640
 So is it a mythical sort of like--

00:30:07.640 --> 00:30:08.760
 No, it's just like--

00:30:08.760 --> 00:30:10.920
 It's literally just like a loaf of bread,

00:30:10.920 --> 00:30:12.840
 but it's in the shape of a person.

00:30:12.840 --> 00:30:13.560
 And they say--

00:30:13.560 --> 00:30:15.000
 And they used to obey bread life, didn't they?

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:17.320
 Well, they say in the Oxford Companions of Food

00:30:17.320 --> 00:30:20.680
 that it is almost universal through all cultures of history.

00:30:20.680 --> 00:30:21.560
 But they've always had a bread post in their culture.

00:30:21.560 --> 00:30:23.320
 They've always had bread people,

00:30:23.320 --> 00:30:27.560
 and they say that they are a form of guilt-free cannibalism.

00:30:27.560 --> 00:30:30.120
 Oh, that's what I was wondering.

00:30:30.120 --> 00:30:31.960
 Is that the transition away from eating human?

00:30:31.960 --> 00:30:38.360
 It says the taboo of eating fellow humans is almost universal.

00:30:38.360 --> 00:30:41.000
 And so we have to eat bread instead.

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:42.120
 Wow.

00:30:42.120 --> 00:30:42.600
 That's so sweet.

00:30:42.600 --> 00:30:45.000
 I don't know what the celiac gluten-free people do.

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:46.680
 They probably keep doing the cannibalism.

00:30:46.680 --> 00:30:47.480
 You've got to.

00:30:47.480 --> 00:30:48.120
 You've got to.

00:30:48.120 --> 00:30:52.120
 I did read that in the Second World War,

00:30:52.120 --> 00:30:54.040
 people were encouraged to eat meat substitute

00:30:54.040 --> 00:30:57.400
 and brown bread was advertised as a meat substitute

00:30:57.400 --> 00:30:59.800
 because I think it had a slightly more protein,

00:30:59.800 --> 00:31:00.760
 I think, than white bread.

00:31:00.760 --> 00:31:02.680
 So it was in all over the newspapers and stuff.

00:31:02.680 --> 00:31:04.440
 You know, hey, rather than eating a steak,

00:31:04.440 --> 00:31:06.440
 I tried a loaf of brown bread.

00:31:06.440 --> 00:31:07.320
 Yeah, it is.

00:31:07.320 --> 00:31:10.760
 One of the founders of alternative meat,

00:31:10.760 --> 00:31:13.000
 as it gets called, or artificial meat or cultured meat,

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:15.320
 was a guy called Willem van Eelen.

00:31:15.320 --> 00:31:16.680
 And he was Dutch.

00:31:16.680 --> 00:31:19.320
 And he had his experience in the Second World War,

00:31:19.320 --> 00:31:20.840
 his formative experience,

00:31:20.840 --> 00:31:24.520
 because he was in a prisoner of war camp, a Japanese one,

00:31:24.520 --> 00:31:26.600
 and food was incredibly short.

00:31:26.600 --> 00:31:30.200
 And he was very lucky to live and not starve.

00:31:30.200 --> 00:31:31.800
 And a few years after the war,

00:31:31.800 --> 00:31:33.960
 he went to medical school in 1948.

00:31:33.960 --> 00:31:35.320
 And he found that researchers there,

00:31:35.320 --> 00:31:37.640
 they were trying to grow some cells in a tank.

00:31:37.640 --> 00:31:38.680
 They weren't trying to grow it for meat.

00:31:38.680 --> 00:31:40.520
 They were trying to grow it as a skin graft thing,

00:31:40.520 --> 00:31:43.320
 if you've been burned, you know, to graft on your skin.

00:31:43.320 --> 00:31:44.440
 And his first thought,

00:31:44.440 --> 00:31:46.440
 because of his formative experiences in the war,

00:31:46.440 --> 00:31:48.360
 were, "I wonder if we could eat that?"

00:31:48.360 --> 00:31:51.480
 You know, he had just been so hungry for such a long time,

00:31:51.480 --> 00:31:54.280
 it had really sort of imprinted itself on his consciousness.

00:31:54.280 --> 00:31:57.640
 And that set him on the path of developing cultured meat.

00:31:57.640 --> 00:32:00.920
 Wow, you'd be nervous around him, I think, whatever, you know.

00:32:00.920 --> 00:32:03.080
 And he exposed body parts to cover up.

00:32:03.080 --> 00:32:04.440
 It's almost like in a cartoon,

00:32:04.440 --> 00:32:05.720
 where he turns around and looks at you,

00:32:05.720 --> 00:32:07.400
 and you've turned into a roast chicken.

00:32:07.400 --> 00:32:09.640
 It was a bit like that for him, yeah.

00:32:10.280 --> 00:32:11.240
 That was incredible.

00:32:11.240 --> 00:32:15.080
 Apparently, peanut butter was invented largely

00:32:15.080 --> 00:32:18.120
 as a substitute for people who found really hard to eat meat.

00:32:18.120 --> 00:32:20.120
 Oh, really? George Washington's cover?

00:32:20.120 --> 00:32:24.120
 Yeah, I think it might have been a Kellogg version of peanut butter.

00:32:24.120 --> 00:32:26.200
 So, like, there was quite a few peanut butter innovations

00:32:26.200 --> 00:32:27.160
 going on at the time.

00:32:27.160 --> 00:32:29.560
 Kellogg certainly, like, promoted nut meat, yeah.

00:32:29.560 --> 00:32:30.600
 Yeah, nut meat.

00:32:30.600 --> 00:32:31.640
 I actually have a soul mate.

00:32:31.640 --> 00:32:33.960
 That is a scam.

00:32:33.960 --> 00:32:34.600
 You're okay, huh?

00:32:34.600 --> 00:32:36.200
 You hardly touch your nut meat.

00:32:39.240 --> 00:32:41.720
 None of this stuff is substitute meat, though.

00:32:41.720 --> 00:32:43.320
 This is annoying so much.

00:32:43.320 --> 00:32:45.080
 Like, in China, ancient China and Japan,

00:32:45.080 --> 00:32:46.840
 they were just eating tofu and soy,

00:32:46.840 --> 00:32:49.240
 because they ate tofu and soy as well.

00:32:49.240 --> 00:32:50.920
 And this is when you read it in the 19th century,

00:32:50.920 --> 00:32:53.960
 when it was just coming to Britain and to Europe,

00:32:53.960 --> 00:32:57.000
 and, like, all of these Chinese Japanese recipes were coming over,

00:32:57.000 --> 00:32:58.680
 they were actually really positive.

00:32:58.680 --> 00:32:59.640
 Across the media, they were like,

00:32:59.640 --> 00:33:02.600
 "Wow, this soy stuff can be made into a thing

00:33:02.600 --> 00:33:04.360
 that is a little bit like meat."

00:33:04.360 --> 00:33:06.280
 But because it didn't have the connotation of,

00:33:06.280 --> 00:33:09.080
 "Oh, we're gonna take away your meat and make you eat soy,"

00:33:09.080 --> 00:33:10.840
 then no one was negative about it.

00:33:10.840 --> 00:33:12.520
 It's really interesting to see.

00:33:12.520 --> 00:33:13.800
 But, yeah, there were fake sausages.

00:33:13.800 --> 00:33:19.480
 I think the first reference to a fake sausage came in 1851,

00:33:19.480 --> 00:33:23.560
 and it was described as being by a graemite,

00:33:23.560 --> 00:33:24.840
 which I didn't know what that was.

00:33:24.840 --> 00:33:26.120
 Do you know a graemite?

00:33:26.120 --> 00:33:27.560
 It's a religious thing?

00:33:27.560 --> 00:33:28.120
 Yes.

00:33:28.120 --> 00:33:30.120
 And do you know what we get from graemites today?

00:33:30.120 --> 00:33:30.920
 Graem's crackers?

00:33:30.920 --> 00:33:32.120
 Yeah, I did.

00:33:32.120 --> 00:33:33.160
 I've never knew this.

00:33:33.160 --> 00:33:35.320
 Graemite, which is actually a thing I only know

00:33:35.320 --> 00:33:36.280
 from friends' episodes,

00:33:36.280 --> 00:33:36.920
 because I think they're in a bad thing.

00:33:36.920 --> 00:33:38.760
 Yeah, I'm not convinced I know what one is.

00:33:38.760 --> 00:33:39.800
 No.

00:33:39.800 --> 00:33:40.840
 They don't exist.

00:33:40.840 --> 00:33:41.800
 So I like shooting stars.

00:33:41.800 --> 00:33:44.360
 It's all a prank.

00:33:44.360 --> 00:33:46.920
 He was a big old veggie anyway,

00:33:46.920 --> 00:33:48.360
 and he invented sort of bread.

00:33:48.360 --> 00:33:50.440
 He thought that bread had been tortured the way we made it,

00:33:50.440 --> 00:33:51.640
 because we ground it so hard.

00:33:51.640 --> 00:33:53.080
 So he said that we should make bread,

00:33:53.080 --> 00:33:55.400
 but leave the flour much rougher and coarser.

00:33:55.400 --> 00:33:57.080
 So that's what Graem's crackers are made of.

00:33:57.080 --> 00:33:57.880
 Okay, interesting.

00:33:57.880 --> 00:34:01.560
 So impossible foods, impossible burgers and stuff,

00:34:01.560 --> 00:34:03.720
 they are tested on animals.

00:34:03.720 --> 00:34:04.920
 Really?

00:34:04.920 --> 00:34:07.480
 And is it they're fed to animals to see if they like them?

00:34:07.480 --> 00:34:07.960
 Cool.

00:34:07.960 --> 00:34:10.440
 So they have this thing called heme in it,

00:34:10.440 --> 00:34:13.400
 which is a vegetable-based liquid

00:34:13.400 --> 00:34:15.240
 that looks a little bit like blood.

00:34:15.240 --> 00:34:17.080
 And so you put it in your fake burgers,

00:34:17.080 --> 00:34:18.280
 and then when you cut into it,

00:34:18.280 --> 00:34:20.120
 it looks like there's blood in your burgers,

00:34:20.120 --> 00:34:21.080
 and that's what people want.

00:34:21.080 --> 00:34:23.160
 But the USDA--

00:34:23.160 --> 00:34:24.520
 Because people are normal.

00:34:24.520 --> 00:34:25.400
 Yeah, I know, I know.

00:34:25.400 --> 00:34:28.440
 Like, sure, I love them, I think they're delicious.

00:34:28.440 --> 00:34:32.600
 But the USDA said that even though they appear to be safe,

00:34:32.600 --> 00:34:34.360
 they need it to be tested properly

00:34:34.360 --> 00:34:36.600
 before they can go into the burgers.

00:34:36.600 --> 00:34:38.600
 And they could have done it without testing on animals,

00:34:38.600 --> 00:34:40.680
 but it would have taken years and years and years.

00:34:40.680 --> 00:34:41.000
 Really?

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:42.680
 And so they tested just on--

00:34:42.680 --> 00:34:44.280
 I think just on one animal, actually.

00:34:44.280 --> 00:34:46.520
 Or certainly just one or two.

00:34:46.520 --> 00:34:50.040
 The guy who was in charge of it, Patrick O. Brown,

00:34:50.040 --> 00:34:51.160
 has basically come out and said,

00:34:51.160 --> 00:34:52.600
 "Yeah, look, we had to do it really."

00:34:52.600 --> 00:34:55.000
 And like, it was just a one-off.

00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:57.640
 And we think that overall, holistically,

00:34:57.640 --> 00:34:59.960
 it's better that we did that one small thing,

00:34:59.960 --> 00:35:01.160
 because overall, it's a good thing.

00:35:01.160 --> 00:35:03.240
 Yeah, you know, Tofurkey?

00:35:03.240 --> 00:35:04.600
 Yeah.

00:35:04.600 --> 00:35:05.640
 Familiar with Tofurkey?

00:35:05.640 --> 00:35:06.200
 No.

00:35:06.200 --> 00:35:07.640
 A tofu turkey?

00:35:07.640 --> 00:35:09.160
 It's vegetarian turkey.

00:35:09.160 --> 00:35:10.280
 It's quite American, isn't it?

00:35:10.280 --> 00:35:10.520
 It is.

00:35:10.520 --> 00:35:12.200
 It was a big thing in the '90s.

00:35:12.200 --> 00:35:13.880
 Well, the guy who invented it, Seth Tibbet,

00:35:13.880 --> 00:35:16.120
 was so broke when he invented Tofurkey

00:35:16.120 --> 00:35:17.640
 that he was living in a tree house.

00:35:17.640 --> 00:35:20.840
 What's the name of that rug?

00:35:20.840 --> 00:35:21.960
 And it wasn't even--

00:35:21.960 --> 00:35:25.240
 He was renting a tree house rather than killing.

00:35:25.240 --> 00:35:29.560
 I've actually stayed in a couple of Airbnb tree houses,

00:35:29.560 --> 00:35:31.400
 and they are not cheap, I've got to say.

00:35:31.400 --> 00:35:32.920
 Yeah, well, he was actually--

00:35:32.920 --> 00:35:34.600
 He was renting the trees.

00:35:34.600 --> 00:35:36.920
 He rented three trees and built the tree house

00:35:36.920 --> 00:35:38.600
 in between them for the farmer.

00:35:38.600 --> 00:35:39.720
 Oh, you can't do that.

00:35:39.720 --> 00:35:41.080
 What do you mean?

00:35:41.080 --> 00:35:43.480
 You can't rent a tree and then build property on--

00:35:43.480 --> 00:35:45.800
 Well, he had asked for permission to do it.

00:35:45.800 --> 00:35:46.120
 Oh, OK.

00:35:46.120 --> 00:35:46.520
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:35:46.520 --> 00:35:47.480
 Let that bit out.

00:35:47.480 --> 00:35:47.880
 Sorry.

00:35:47.880 --> 00:35:50.920
 Anyway, there you go.

00:35:50.920 --> 00:35:53.320
 Guys, I will have to move us on to our final fact

00:35:53.320 --> 00:35:54.120
 in a second.

00:35:54.120 --> 00:35:55.480
 So, yeah, if you've got anything.

00:35:55.480 --> 00:35:58.840
 Guess what the first meat that NASA experimented

00:35:58.840 --> 00:36:01.000
 with growing so that potentially astronauts

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:03.720
 could culture their own sort of cell-cultured meat

00:36:03.720 --> 00:36:04.440
 in space was?

00:36:04.440 --> 00:36:05.560
 Guess what the first meat they tried was?

00:36:05.560 --> 00:36:07.080
 Oh, well, steak.

00:36:07.080 --> 00:36:08.120
 Goldfish.

00:36:08.120 --> 00:36:08.760
 Goldfish?

00:36:08.760 --> 00:36:11.320
 Goldfish?

00:36:11.320 --> 00:36:12.760
 Come on, bit.

00:36:12.760 --> 00:36:15.880
 Yep, they took some goldfish steaks

00:36:15.880 --> 00:36:16.600
 and they tried to--

00:36:16.600 --> 00:36:17.720
 Goldfish steaks?

00:36:17.720 --> 00:36:22.440
 If I order a steak and that comes, I'm sending it back.

00:36:22.440 --> 00:36:28.200
 Yeah, they were just trying to grow the goldfish muscle

00:36:28.200 --> 00:36:28.600
 in there.

00:36:28.600 --> 00:36:29.080
 How was it?

00:36:29.080 --> 00:36:31.160
 It must have been like--

00:36:31.160 --> 00:36:33.400
 Because they do grow quite big goldfish, don't they?

00:36:33.400 --> 00:36:34.840
 Yeah, it's not like one of those little ones

00:36:34.840 --> 00:36:35.640
 you get in the fair.

00:36:35.640 --> 00:36:36.920
 I don't think so, no.

00:36:36.920 --> 00:36:38.120
 But I think, anyway, it wasn't--

00:36:38.120 --> 00:36:38.680
 That's so funny.

00:36:38.680 --> 00:36:40.840
 I don't think anyone-- it even got to being tasted.

00:36:40.840 --> 00:36:41.400
 Yeah, right.

00:36:41.400 --> 00:36:44.280
 Can I quickly tell you, do you know why soy sauce

00:36:44.280 --> 00:36:45.000
 is called soy sauce?

00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:46.200
 Because it has soy in it.

00:36:46.200 --> 00:36:47.000
 And it's saucy.

00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:51.880
 Dan is actually right about the sauce bit.

00:36:51.880 --> 00:36:56.280
 No, soy beans are named after soy sauce.

00:36:56.280 --> 00:36:57.480
 Come on, bit.

00:36:57.480 --> 00:37:00.520
 No, how did that-- how does that work?

00:37:00.520 --> 00:37:02.840
 How did they get-- who found the first soy sauce?

00:37:02.840 --> 00:37:04.120
 That's like the time loop there.

00:37:04.120 --> 00:37:06.600
 You grow soy sauce and you separate it into beans.

00:37:06.600 --> 00:37:15.240
 Yeah, we just got soy, which again, it came over from Japan.

00:37:15.240 --> 00:37:16.920
 It was about 1300s.

00:37:16.920 --> 00:37:19.240
 It was called shoyu, the sauce that they made from beans,

00:37:19.240 --> 00:37:20.680
 which they didn't call shoyu beans.

00:37:20.680 --> 00:37:21.960
 They call it something different.

00:37:21.960 --> 00:37:24.360
 And so we, for a couple of hundred years,

00:37:24.360 --> 00:37:28.040
 called it an all across the variations of soy sauce.

00:37:28.040 --> 00:37:29.000
 No one knew what it was made of.

00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:30.760
 So everyone tried to make substitutes out of--

00:37:30.760 --> 00:37:33.160
 the first ketchup was an attempt to make soy sauce.

00:37:33.160 --> 00:37:36.280
 Oh, so they put round of fish and mushrooms and all that stuff.

00:37:36.280 --> 00:37:37.000
 Exactly.

00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:38.120
 Yeah, a lot of mushroom attempts.

00:37:38.120 --> 00:37:39.960
 And then they realized, oh, they use this weird bean.

00:37:39.960 --> 00:37:41.240
 Let's call it the soy bean.

00:37:41.240 --> 00:37:42.760
 And that's why it was like that.

00:37:42.760 --> 00:37:43.480
 That's amazing.

00:37:43.480 --> 00:37:50.360
 It's time for a final fact to show.

00:37:50.360 --> 00:37:51.480
 And that is my fact.

00:37:51.480 --> 00:37:55.000
 My fact this week is that after Bruce Lee died,

00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:58.760
 Chinese movie studios tried to exploit the gap he left

00:37:58.760 --> 00:38:04.680
 by immediately releasing films starring Bruce Lai, Lee Bruce,

00:38:04.680 --> 00:38:06.680
 and Brut Lee.

00:38:06.680 --> 00:38:15.240
 This was-- it's called Bruceploitation, where after he sadly passed away,

00:38:15.240 --> 00:38:19.720
 very prematurely, the Chinese studios went, America wants Bruce Lee movies.

00:38:19.720 --> 00:38:21.720
 So he did Enter the Dragon.

00:38:21.720 --> 00:38:24.280
 Quickly, let's get re-Enter the Dragon into production.

00:38:24.280 --> 00:38:26.920
 They like the name Bruce and Lee quickly.

00:38:26.920 --> 00:38:30.360
 Let's just find other people and name them that in very similar ways.

00:38:30.360 --> 00:38:33.800
 Bruce Lai is now starring in Bruce Lee versus Superman,

00:38:33.800 --> 00:38:36.600
 which is a movie, by the way, from this period.

00:38:36.600 --> 00:38:39.000
 OK, so they didn't find people with these names.

00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:40.920
 They found people and then gave them these names.

00:38:40.920 --> 00:38:43.800
 Yeah, I think that's an easier way of doing it, to be fair.

00:38:43.800 --> 00:38:47.480
 Yeah, because if you find Lee Bruce or whatever,

00:38:47.480 --> 00:38:49.800
 and he's like an out-of-work accountant,

00:38:49.800 --> 00:38:53.160
 then it's going to be harder to get him in shape, isn't it?

00:38:53.160 --> 00:38:55.400
 I don't know if there's two Patrick Stewart's, you're going to get--

00:38:55.880 --> 00:38:56.360
 Yeah.

00:38:56.360 --> 00:39:00.040
 Dan, I presume you're a big Bruce Lee fan.

00:39:00.040 --> 00:39:01.000
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:01.480
 Yeah, grew up on it.

00:39:01.480 --> 00:39:02.440
 Because you grew up in Hong Kong.

00:39:02.440 --> 00:39:02.680
 Yeah.

00:39:02.680 --> 00:39:03.320
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:39:03.320 --> 00:39:04.120
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:39:04.120 --> 00:39:06.600
 Have you seen The Game of Death?

00:39:06.600 --> 00:39:07.960
 Yeah, this was the movie he was making,

00:39:07.960 --> 00:39:10.280
 like he died halfway through making.

00:39:10.280 --> 00:39:11.160
 Exactly.

00:39:11.160 --> 00:39:14.680
 And they had a problem because they had 40 minutes of Bruce Lee footage,

00:39:14.680 --> 00:39:17.560
 and you're not allowed to make a film that's 40 minutes long.

00:39:17.560 --> 00:39:20.440
 So they just hired body doubles.

00:39:20.440 --> 00:39:21.880
 They put them in sunglasses.

00:39:21.880 --> 00:39:24.680
 They filmed them, you know, at a distance.

00:39:24.680 --> 00:39:26.680
 Or in silhouette.

00:39:26.680 --> 00:39:29.800
 Or they used some footage of Bruce Lee's actual funeral.

00:39:29.800 --> 00:39:31.000
 Bit weird.

00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:31.480
 Oh, wow.

00:39:31.480 --> 00:39:31.880
 Yeah.

00:39:31.880 --> 00:39:33.880
 Also, it completely rose the point of the film, I'd guess,

00:39:33.880 --> 00:39:35.560
 if you think, oh, well, there he is, he's dead.

00:39:35.560 --> 00:39:36.040
 But anyway.

00:39:36.040 --> 00:39:36.920
 Yeah.

00:39:36.920 --> 00:39:39.080
 And they just sort of fattened the thing up into a Bruce Lee movie.

00:39:39.080 --> 00:39:41.400
 And it was five years after his death that they released this.

00:39:41.400 --> 00:39:42.040
 Well, that's the thing.

00:39:42.040 --> 00:39:43.800
 I mean, if you look at the list of movies,

00:39:43.800 --> 00:39:45.000
 like that was called Game of Death.

00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:45.480
 Yeah.

00:39:45.480 --> 00:39:47.160
 They then released New Game of Death.

00:39:47.160 --> 00:39:51.240
 Like, Bruce Lee, the star of all stars, Bruce Lee's secret.

00:39:51.240 --> 00:39:52.920
 Bruce Lee in New Guinea.

00:39:52.920 --> 00:39:54.040
 Like, just like--

00:39:54.040 --> 00:39:56.600
 Like, it's so weird that there was this massive demand.

00:39:56.600 --> 00:39:57.800
 Because I haven't--

00:39:57.800 --> 00:39:59.880
 I really didn't know anything about Bruce Lee.

00:39:59.880 --> 00:40:01.800
 And didn't know how fascinated I'd be by him.

00:40:01.800 --> 00:40:03.400
 He is an amazing character.

00:40:03.400 --> 00:40:05.640
 But I also didn't realize he was not big,

00:40:05.640 --> 00:40:08.200
 really at all, until he died in America.

00:40:08.200 --> 00:40:09.560
 So he was massive in Hong Kong.

00:40:09.560 --> 00:40:12.760
 He'd done, I think it was his fourth American film,

00:40:12.760 --> 00:40:13.640
 Enter the Dragon.

00:40:13.640 --> 00:40:15.400
 And that was really the film that made him really big.

00:40:15.400 --> 00:40:16.200
 And everyone loved him.

00:40:16.200 --> 00:40:18.280
 And he died a couple of weeks before the premiere.

00:40:18.280 --> 00:40:19.400
 Three weeks before the premiere.

00:40:19.400 --> 00:40:22.360
 Very, very young, very sadly in his early 30s.

00:40:22.360 --> 00:40:24.440
 And yeah, hadn't been big at all before then.

00:40:24.440 --> 00:40:26.600
 And then was this huge deal.

00:40:26.600 --> 00:40:28.360
 But the New York Times obituary when he died,

00:40:28.360 --> 00:40:30.440
 three weeks before that big film came out,

00:40:30.440 --> 00:40:33.240
 said, "His films were successful in New York

00:40:33.240 --> 00:40:35.800
 by unanimously disapproving reviews.

00:40:35.800 --> 00:40:40.040
 And the film Fist of Fury makes the worst Italian Western

00:40:40.040 --> 00:40:42.040
 look like the most solemn and noble achievements

00:40:42.040 --> 00:40:43.480
 of the early Soviet cinema."

00:40:43.480 --> 00:40:44.760
 Wow.

00:40:44.760 --> 00:40:46.440
 That's in his old obituary.

00:40:46.440 --> 00:40:47.240
 Yeah, yeah.

00:40:47.240 --> 00:40:48.360
 And that's it.

00:40:48.360 --> 00:40:51.080
 It was nothing good.

00:40:51.080 --> 00:40:54.520
 It said he had begun to win audiences in Latin America.

00:40:54.520 --> 00:40:57.000
 The end.

00:40:57.000 --> 00:40:57.960
 It's so weird.

00:40:57.960 --> 00:41:00.760
 Because he's, I mean, he's big all over the world now, right?

00:41:00.760 --> 00:41:01.240
 I think.

00:41:01.240 --> 00:41:04.360
 Because I was in Mostar in Bosnia.

00:41:04.360 --> 00:41:07.000
 And there's a statue of him there in the middle of Mostar,

00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:08.040
 which I saw.

00:41:08.040 --> 00:41:09.800
 And the reason that there's a statue there

00:41:09.800 --> 00:41:12.680
 is because it was just after the Balkan War.

00:41:12.680 --> 00:41:14.680
 They had the Croatians, the Bosnians,

00:41:14.680 --> 00:41:15.960
 the Serbians, everyone.

00:41:15.960 --> 00:41:17.400
 Everybody was kung fu fighting, yes?

00:41:20.920 --> 00:41:24.840
 [LAUGHTER]

00:41:24.840 --> 00:41:26.200
 I'm very sorry to trivialise.

00:41:26.200 --> 00:41:28.200
 What was an appalling conflict?

00:41:28.200 --> 00:41:34.520
 And it was a little bit frightening, yes.

00:41:34.520 --> 00:41:36.040
 But they needed the statue of someone,

00:41:36.040 --> 00:41:38.200
 and they couldn't decide who to get a statue of.

00:41:38.200 --> 00:41:39.720
 And Bruce Lee was the only one that everyone

00:41:39.720 --> 00:41:40.440
 agreed they liked.

00:41:40.440 --> 00:41:41.560
 [LAUGHTER]

00:41:41.560 --> 00:41:41.960
 Really?

00:41:41.960 --> 00:41:43.320
 And it's still there in the middle of the park.

00:41:43.320 --> 00:41:44.680
 It's outside of town, yeah?

00:41:44.680 --> 00:41:45.320
 It's interesting.

00:41:45.320 --> 00:41:46.680
 But I'd heard of the statue.

00:41:46.680 --> 00:41:47.800
 I had no idea that was the reason for it.

00:41:47.800 --> 00:41:48.920
 Someone stole it, right?

00:41:48.920 --> 00:41:50.280
 It was there when I was there.

00:41:50.280 --> 00:41:50.760
 Right.

00:41:50.760 --> 00:41:53.000
 I think at one point it got stolen.

00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:53.800
 They didn't see who it was.

00:41:53.800 --> 00:41:54.840
 It was as fast as lightning.

00:41:54.840 --> 00:41:56.920
 [LAUGHTER]

00:41:56.920 --> 00:41:57.880
 But it was stolen.

00:41:57.880 --> 00:41:59.560
 And apparently during that fight,

00:41:59.560 --> 00:42:02.360
 where they put it up as a bit of peace,

00:42:02.360 --> 00:42:06.520
 the way they faced it was towards one of the sides.

00:42:06.520 --> 00:42:09.400
 So the statue of Bruce, in his fighting stance,

00:42:09.400 --> 00:42:10.600
 to them was offensive.

00:42:10.600 --> 00:42:11.720
 Because they were like, you're suggesting

00:42:11.720 --> 00:42:13.960
 Bruce is on your team now, and he's fighting us.

00:42:13.960 --> 00:42:15.080
 I heard that as well.

00:42:15.080 --> 00:42:15.880
 Yeah.

00:42:15.880 --> 00:42:17.720
 But again, contain multitudes, Bruce Lee.

00:42:17.720 --> 00:42:20.680
 So he wrote a lot of poetry, which was published.

00:42:20.680 --> 00:42:25.080
 Former Hong Kong Cha Cha champion.

00:42:25.080 --> 00:42:27.880
 That's the champion of the Cha Cha dance, right?

00:42:27.880 --> 00:42:29.400
 Sorry, I didn't just do one of it.

00:42:29.400 --> 00:42:30.120
 That's stuttering.

00:42:30.120 --> 00:42:32.680
 Temporary localised stuff, yeah.

00:42:32.680 --> 00:42:35.800
 And his wife was Swedish, Swedish-American.

00:42:35.800 --> 00:42:36.520
 Hey!

00:42:36.520 --> 00:42:37.560
 It's the fact.

00:42:37.560 --> 00:42:38.360
 And that was--

00:42:38.360 --> 00:42:40.280
 The wife who he cheated on to jag the mistress,

00:42:40.280 --> 00:42:41.400
 whose house he was found dead in.

00:42:41.400 --> 00:42:43.560
 Hey!

00:42:43.560 --> 00:42:46.040
 Who was a good friend of my mum and dad?

00:42:46.040 --> 00:42:49.560
 Betsy Ting, the woman whose house he died in

00:42:49.560 --> 00:42:50.360
 knows your mum and dad.

00:42:50.360 --> 00:42:51.720
 The woman who there were conspiracy theories

00:42:51.720 --> 00:42:53.240
 all over the world that she was somehow

00:42:53.240 --> 00:42:54.360
 responsible for his death.

00:42:54.360 --> 00:42:58.920
 My parents started those conspiracy theories.

00:42:58.920 --> 00:43:02.840
 Sally runs in the family.

00:43:02.840 --> 00:43:04.200
 Along with his films, when they were filming

00:43:04.200 --> 00:43:08.040
 the fight scenes, the extras in Enter the Dragon,

00:43:08.040 --> 00:43:10.760
 many of them were actually in local gangs,

00:43:10.760 --> 00:43:12.680
 or triad gangs, in Hong Kong.

00:43:12.680 --> 00:43:14.360
 So quite frequently, they would keep fighting

00:43:14.360 --> 00:43:17.800
 after the director yelled cut.

00:43:17.800 --> 00:43:18.680
 Just cut?

00:43:18.680 --> 00:43:21.800
 Yes, I have him!

00:43:21.800 --> 00:43:23.720
 Yeah, because that's the thing with Bruce Lee, right?

00:43:23.720 --> 00:43:25.480
 He was in gangs in Hong Kong.

00:43:25.480 --> 00:43:26.120
 Is that right?

00:43:26.120 --> 00:43:27.000
 He had to-- yeah.

00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:28.440
 So yeah, tell the story, then.

00:43:28.440 --> 00:43:29.880
 When he was young, he got in a fight.

00:43:29.880 --> 00:43:32.520
 He picked a wrong fight with a gang leader,

00:43:32.520 --> 00:43:35.160
 and that's the reason he ended up going over to America,

00:43:35.160 --> 00:43:36.920
 because he was fleeing death, basically.

00:43:36.920 --> 00:43:38.680
 He had to get away.

00:43:38.680 --> 00:43:39.640
 That's right.

00:43:39.640 --> 00:43:42.280
 And then he was a great martial artist,

00:43:42.280 --> 00:43:43.720
 but he did lots of different martial arts.

00:43:43.720 --> 00:43:46.040
 But he always said that the reason he was so good at it

00:43:46.040 --> 00:43:48.200
 is because his right leg is one inch shorter

00:43:48.200 --> 00:43:53.320
 than his left leg, which apparently helped his kicking.

00:43:53.320 --> 00:43:57.720
 And he was also nearsighted, so he liked to do close combat,

00:43:57.720 --> 00:44:01.960
 because then he could see the person he was hitting.

00:44:01.960 --> 00:44:03.560
 Well, apparently on set one day,

00:44:03.560 --> 00:44:06.360
 they were in an area where the locals were very unhappy

00:44:06.360 --> 00:44:07.880
 that they were filming there,

00:44:07.880 --> 00:44:09.720
 and he was talking to the director,

00:44:09.720 --> 00:44:11.880
 and they were standing on a sort of hilltop,

00:44:11.880 --> 00:44:14.600
 and they started getting surrounded by the locals,

00:44:14.600 --> 00:44:17.080
 and they knew that something bad was about to happen.

00:44:17.080 --> 00:44:20.920
 And apparently what Bruce did was he jumped into the air,

00:44:20.920 --> 00:44:26.760
 and he pulled a perfect horizontal plank, basically,

00:44:26.760 --> 00:44:27.960
 in the air.

00:44:27.960 --> 00:44:30.680
 So the way he jumped, it looked like he was levitating,

00:44:30.680 --> 00:44:32.280
 and then he came back down on his legs,

00:44:32.280 --> 00:44:35.240
 and apparently everyone was like, "Wow, Bruce!"

00:44:35.240 --> 00:44:36.360
 And then they didn't beat them up.

00:44:36.360 --> 00:44:41.160
 At least that's the story my parents have been telling me about.

00:44:41.160 --> 00:44:46.520
 He was supposed to be drafted by the U.S. Army.

00:44:46.520 --> 00:44:49.720
 In fact, he was drafted, but he didn't see any service,

00:44:49.720 --> 00:44:51.400
 because he failed a medical.

00:44:51.400 --> 00:44:52.920
 Apparently he had bad eyesight.

00:44:52.920 --> 00:44:54.840
 As I said, he had a sinus disorder,

00:44:54.840 --> 00:44:56.120
 and he only had one testicle.

00:44:56.120 --> 00:44:57.640
 Oh, yeah.

00:44:57.640 --> 00:44:58.520
 So it's quite interesting,

00:44:58.520 --> 00:45:00.280
 because that means I couldn't get in the U.S. Army,

00:45:00.280 --> 00:45:02.360
 because I also have bad sinuses.

00:45:02.360 --> 00:45:08.200
 But you have three testicles, which one do you have?

00:45:08.200 --> 00:45:09.560
 A super soldier, yeah.

00:45:09.560 --> 00:45:12.840
 Was it the one that had not descended?

00:45:12.840 --> 00:45:13.880
 Yeah, it's just not descended.

00:45:13.880 --> 00:45:16.360
 Yeah, I read that put as,

00:45:16.360 --> 00:45:18.760
 "So it was impossible to kick Bruce Lee in the testicles."

00:45:18.760 --> 00:45:19.320
 It's pretty cool.

00:45:19.320 --> 00:45:19.720
 That's true.

00:45:19.720 --> 00:45:21.160
 You could kick him in the testicle, though,

00:45:21.160 --> 00:45:23.800
 which I should imagine hurts just as bad.

00:45:23.800 --> 00:45:27.480
 I did read, so there's a book called "The Tower of Bruce Lee,"

00:45:27.480 --> 00:45:29.480
 which I was reading about by an author called David Miller,

00:45:29.480 --> 00:45:31.880
 and he reckons that Bruce Lee actually really, in his life,

00:45:31.880 --> 00:45:33.800
 he only had a few proper fights.

00:45:33.800 --> 00:45:36.680
 You know, obviously it's mostly screen and training and all of this,

00:45:36.680 --> 00:45:39.320
 and he says, "I just wanted to quote this, I really like this line."

00:45:39.320 --> 00:45:41.240
 He was an absolutely remarkable man,

00:45:41.240 --> 00:45:43.480
 but he wasn't the Jesus of martial arts,

00:45:43.480 --> 00:45:45.560
 and that's the way he's often presented these days.

00:45:45.560 --> 00:45:48.280
 Could he have stuck his fingers in your eyes more quickly

00:45:48.280 --> 00:45:49.800
 than anyone else on the planet?

00:45:49.800 --> 00:45:50.360
 Maybe so.

00:45:50.360 --> 00:45:54.600
 But what you have to remember

00:45:54.600 --> 00:45:56.280
 is that is exactly what he would have done.

00:45:56.280 --> 00:45:57.400
 That's real fighting.

00:45:57.400 --> 00:45:59.000
 He would have stuck his fingers in your eyes,

00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:01.240
 kicked you in the leg, and got the hell out of there.

00:46:01.240 --> 00:46:01.640
 Right.

00:46:01.640 --> 00:46:03.000
 And that's apparently the...

00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:04.440
 Well, apparently he was so quick.

00:46:04.440 --> 00:46:06.760
 What he could do is, if you laid your palm out

00:46:06.760 --> 00:46:08.760
 and you had a pound coin on there,

00:46:08.760 --> 00:46:12.280
 he could grab it out of your hand before you closed your hand,

00:46:12.280 --> 00:46:13.640
 and then when you opened your hand,

00:46:13.640 --> 00:46:16.440
 he had replaced the pound with a penny.

00:46:16.440 --> 00:46:17.320
 Okay.

00:46:17.320 --> 00:46:18.920
 As in as you were opening it...

00:46:18.920 --> 00:46:19.960
 That's who you were like, "What?"

00:46:19.960 --> 00:46:21.720
 So imagine like you were Bruce,

00:46:21.720 --> 00:46:22.920
 and I was like, "Go!"

00:46:22.920 --> 00:46:24.680
 And I closed my hand, and I'm like, "Haha."

00:46:24.680 --> 00:46:25.880
 You didn't get it, and then I opened it,

00:46:25.880 --> 00:46:27.000
 and I see you've changed.

00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:28.120
 You were so quick, you took it,

00:46:28.120 --> 00:46:30.200
 and you put a new coin in place of my coin.

00:46:30.200 --> 00:46:31.960
 Oh, I suppose as you've picked up the pound,

00:46:31.960 --> 00:46:33.000
 you've put a penny in.

00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:33.800
 No, I could do that.

00:46:33.800 --> 00:46:37.240
 I could do that.

00:46:37.240 --> 00:46:40.840
 He just said some weird targets for himself.

00:46:40.840 --> 00:46:43.480
 It was like the original Guinness World Record Breaker,

00:46:43.480 --> 00:46:44.520
 and then break them.

00:46:44.520 --> 00:46:46.360
 And he did want to kind of hone himself

00:46:46.360 --> 00:46:48.120
 into this perfect human specimen,

00:46:48.120 --> 00:46:51.640
 which weirdly people thought might be why he died.

00:46:51.640 --> 00:46:55.560
 There was a thought that he just had eradicated from his body

00:46:55.560 --> 00:46:57.320
 all extraneous anything,

00:46:57.320 --> 00:46:59.320
 and that sort of killed him somehow.

00:46:59.320 --> 00:47:00.600
 Yeah, it's not really...

00:47:00.600 --> 00:47:02.120
 Bad body of parents, look at that one.

00:47:02.120 --> 00:47:05.400
 That's not the story of the Shriver Denitator,

00:47:05.400 --> 00:47:06.520
 I can tell you that.

00:47:06.520 --> 00:47:08.280
 I buy this, I buy this.

00:47:08.280 --> 00:47:10.440
 So, right, because there are lots of theories,

00:47:10.440 --> 00:47:11.880
 one is that he died of a swelling of the brain,

00:47:11.880 --> 00:47:13.560
 which I think is what was the official finding

00:47:13.560 --> 00:47:14.280
 from the inquiry.

00:47:14.280 --> 00:47:15.560
 Yeah, I think the brain definitely did swell,

00:47:15.560 --> 00:47:16.680
 but it was as if it was wine.

00:47:16.680 --> 00:47:19.480
 Well, is it because he was so, so, so fit?

00:47:19.480 --> 00:47:20.520
 He got rid of all fat,

00:47:20.520 --> 00:47:22.840
 so there was no subcutaneous fat on his body at all.

00:47:22.840 --> 00:47:24.360
 That could be a problem.

00:47:24.360 --> 00:47:26.120
 So, this was his routine when he died, right?

00:47:26.120 --> 00:47:29.240
 He drank liquidized steak and cow's blood every morning,

00:47:29.240 --> 00:47:30.280
 then he ran seven miles...

00:47:30.280 --> 00:47:31.080
 Wait, wait, wait.

00:47:31.080 --> 00:47:31.880
 Goldfish steak?

00:47:31.880 --> 00:47:32.520
 Goldfish steak.

00:47:32.520 --> 00:47:39.880
 Then he would run seven miles with his Great Dane dog,

00:47:39.880 --> 00:47:42.520
 some of it backwards, some of it up the side of trees.

00:47:42.520 --> 00:47:44.520
 Checked out, yeah.

00:47:44.520 --> 00:47:46.280
 And he was just too fit.

00:47:46.280 --> 00:47:47.320
 Also, there's another theory

00:47:47.320 --> 00:47:49.320
 that he didn't have any sweat glands.

00:47:49.320 --> 00:47:50.440
 He didn't have any sweat glands,

00:47:50.440 --> 00:47:51.480
 because he'd had them...

00:47:51.480 --> 00:47:53.320
 And this is the idea that he died of heat,

00:47:53.320 --> 00:47:54.280
 like overheating,

00:47:54.280 --> 00:47:58.200
 because he'd had his armpit glands removed out of vanity.

00:47:58.200 --> 00:47:59.720
 And let this be a lesson to the vein

00:47:59.720 --> 00:48:02.600
 that he thought that sweating made him look bad on screen.

00:48:02.600 --> 00:48:05.720
 And then I found this most plausible theory about his death,

00:48:05.720 --> 00:48:08.040
 because he'd had a brain swelling a few weeks early.

00:48:08.040 --> 00:48:10.360
 Well, no one knows, really, no one knows what killed him.

00:48:10.360 --> 00:48:12.520
 But almost all your sweat comes out of the rest of you?

00:48:12.520 --> 00:48:14.680
 Yes, I think he would just have probably overheated anyway.

00:48:14.680 --> 00:48:16.120
 It was a very hot day.

00:48:16.120 --> 00:48:18.200
 And he had this habit of whenever he was getting excited

00:48:18.200 --> 00:48:20.360
 talking about a project of like doing, acting out,

00:48:20.360 --> 00:48:21.160
 the whole film.

00:48:21.160 --> 00:48:23.640
 So the person who was with him said he'd literally acted out

00:48:23.640 --> 00:48:26.600
 the martial arts of an entire film that he was planning to do.

00:48:26.600 --> 00:48:27.960
 Can you emergency get rid of the heat?

00:48:27.960 --> 00:48:29.240
 Like, can you just drool a lot?

00:48:29.240 --> 00:48:33.000
 Like, is there to get that, to get, yeah, just the liquid out of you?

00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:34.600
 What kind of cold bath maybe?

00:48:34.600 --> 00:48:35.800
 I don't know, but it's a shame,

00:48:35.800 --> 00:48:37.160
 because we never got to find out

00:48:37.160 --> 00:48:39.320
 whether he achieved one thing he wanted to do,

00:48:39.320 --> 00:48:41.080
 which was he, well, first of all,

00:48:41.080 --> 00:48:43.480
 he was experimenting with electro-shocking himself.

00:48:43.480 --> 00:48:46.920
 So in his sleep, he like ran electricity through his muscles

00:48:46.920 --> 00:48:48.760
 to fine tune his reflexes.

00:48:48.760 --> 00:48:50.440
 And he said that by the end of the year,

00:48:50.440 --> 00:48:52.600
 he was going to be able to drive his fingers

00:48:52.600 --> 00:48:55.400
 right up to the middle knuckle through pine planks.

00:48:55.400 --> 00:48:55.880
 Wow.

00:48:55.880 --> 00:48:58.440
 And we never will know if he could do that

00:48:58.440 --> 00:49:00.360
 with just one finger through a plank of wood.

00:49:00.360 --> 00:49:02.040
 It's a shame I didn't come through the coffin lid.

00:49:02.680 --> 00:49:03.640
 Just kidding.

00:49:03.640 --> 00:49:11.400
 I need to wrap this up, guys.

00:49:11.400 --> 00:49:12.840
 We've got to the end of our show.

00:49:12.840 --> 00:49:14.200
