1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,520
 Hey, everybody, Dan here.

2
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:03,680
 Welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish.

3
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:05,340
 Before we begin this week's episode,

4
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:06,920
 we have a big announcement.

5
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:10,000
 We have signed to an indie label

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,400
 because we are releasing a vinyl.

7
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:14,560
 We genuinely are releasing a vinyl.

8
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:16,920
 It's an exclusive episode we've recorded.

9
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:19,840
 And if you buy it, you'll get a remastered version

10
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:21,680
 of our first 52 episodes.

11
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:24,040
 That's the first year of No Such Thing as a Fish.

12
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:25,960
 We're doing this through Alcopot Records.

13
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:29,440
 You can go to qi.com/fishvinyl

14
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:30,720
 and do pre-orders now.

15
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:33,480
 There's a limited edition completely yellow vinyl.

16
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:35,720
 The vinyl itself is going to be completely yellow.

17
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:38,160
 And we're going to be launching it properly for sale

18
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:39,960
 on the 20th of November.

19
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:41,840
 If you'd like to come to our launch night,

20
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:43,600
 that's going to be the live podcast recording

21
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,920
 we're doing at the Lyric Theater in London's West End.

22
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,080
 It's our biggest gig ever.

23
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:48,480
 It's a thousand seeder.

24
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:51,040
 Hopefully you can come and pick up a vinyl.

25
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:53,520
 And also, speaking of the Lyric Theater event,

26
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:56,960
 as another string to our rock and roll bow,

27
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:00,200
 we are on tour and we'd love to see any

28
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:03,360
 and/or all of you at one of our tour date venues.

29
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:06,760
 So if you go to qi.com/fishvents,

00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:09,000
 you can see all the venues that are confirmed so far.

31
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,800
 We're going to be in Manchester.

32
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:12,080
 We're going to Brighton.

33
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:16,200
 We are going to Glasgow, Leeds, Bristol, Birmingham.

34
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:17,920
 So yeah, come along.

35
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:18,840
 On with the show.

36
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:22,560
 [funky music]

37
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:35,040
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish

38
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:37,280
 a weekly podcast this week coming to you

39
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,280
 from the Edinburgh Fringe Festival.

40
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,920
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

41
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:43,240
 Joining me is ever the three qi elves.

42
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:45,400
 Please welcome to the stage is Andy Murray,

43
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:48,120
 Anacisinsky, and James Harkin.

44
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:50,960
 [cheers and applause]

45
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:56,760
 And once again, we've gathered around the microphones

46
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:59,160
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days

47
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:01,640
 and in no particular order, here we go.

48
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,800
 Starting with you, James Harkin.

49
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:07,320
 Okay, my fact this week is that Las Vegas hosts

50
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:11,200
 an awards ceremony for people who make awards.

51
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,680
 [laughter]

52
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,160
 What do they get?

53
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:17,600
 They get a gold obelisk.

54
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,280
 Oh, that's good, isn't it?

55
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:22,000
 It's the awards and personalization association

56
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,280
 and they celebrate things like best trophy.

57
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:26,280
 That gets an award.

58
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,600
 Best plaque.

59
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:28,280
 That gets one.

60
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,040
 Best plaque.

61
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:29,840
 Best plaque.

62
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,960
 And a best sandblasting.

63
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,480
 That's one.

64
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:34,240
 What is that?

65
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,000
 I didn't look it up.

66
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,880
 [laughter]

67
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:40,560
 Yeah, the US and Canada industry for awards

68
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,800
 is $3 billion a year.

69
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,800
 That's how much people spend on awards.

70
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,640
 And that I worked it out is enough to give every person

71
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:51,160
 in the country a three to five inch resin trophy

72
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,840
 in the spot of their choice.

73
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:55,840
 [laughter]

74
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,800
 That seems a much better way of doing it.

75
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,760
 Just do away with all the games and spots.

76
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:01,840
 Just give everyone a trophy.

77
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:02,680
 Yeah.

78
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:03,440
 You're great.

79
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,640
 That's amazing.

80
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,760
 That's because, well, they aren't hugely money, don't they?

81
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:08,360
 The Oscars, we might have talked about this before,

82
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:10,200
 the Oscars, the party bag that you get

83
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,000
 if you're attending the Oscars is extraordinary.

84
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,240
 It's worth something like 120 grand per bag.

85
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:17,600
 Last year's or the year before's came with every female

86
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:20,880
 who'd attended a got in their party bag,

87
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:22,520
 genitals stimulator, I think.

88
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:25,680
 Also, no, it was surgery that can be performed on you

89
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,520
 in order that you have better orgasms.

90
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:29,240
 And every woman who attended the Oscars

91
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:32,560
 got a little voucher for one of these surgeries.

92
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,560
 [laughter]

93
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,280
 So yeah, it's good to, it's better than the party bags

94
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,280
 of youth.

95
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,320
 [laughter]

96
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:41,520
 Yeah, it's not a balloon and a bit of cake wrapped

97
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:43,520
 in the tissue, is it?

98
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:46,240
 Mind you, I think you'd be in trouble at a child birthday party, yeah?

99
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:50,560
 [laughter]

100
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,680
 I started looking up some other awards ceremonies

101
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,480
 that the UK has based on this fact.

102
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:58,920
 And you might like to know that there is a British cabab awards

103
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:03,280
 where categories include best newcomer cabab restaurant

104
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:07,560
 and outstanding contribution to the cabab industry,

105
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,400
 which this year, I'm sure we all know,

106
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:14,120
 was one by Edmonton Meat.

107
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:16,320
 How are the acceptance speeches for that?

108
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,960
 You just have to slowly turn around as you make a speech.

109
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:22,200
 [laughter]

110
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:24,600
 Another award ceremony that they have,

111
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:27,320
 which I think the prize for this is enormous,

112
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:28,560
 given the nature of it.

113
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:33,600
 So the smelly foot contest, the reiki foot competition

114
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,840
 for which is called the sneaker contest, the sneaker contest.

115
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:40,440
 And the winner every year gets $2,500,

116
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:43,800
 as well as two nights in New York and a trip to a Broadway show,

117
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,000
 which just approving that you're happy to say.

118
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,200
 But having smelly feet.

119
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:46,800
 Yeah.

120
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,200
 How's it judged?

121
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:50,200
 It's the panel of judges.

122
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,400
 I can tell you how it's judged,

123
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:54,000
 because I actually coincidentally googled this as well.

124
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,280
 [laughter]

125
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:58,680
 They check the condition of your heel of your shoe,

126
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:01,920
 the sole, the tongue, the shoelaces,

127
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:05,120
 the older of the shoe, which is tested by a group of people,

128
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,120
 one of whom is NASA's sniffer.

129
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,280
 No.

130
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:11,120
 The guy who smells everything before it goes up in space.

131
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,960
 Oh, this guy's incredible.

132
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:15,680
 Nothing goes into space unless he goes under his nose.

133
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:16,920
 And he goes, yep.

134
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:19,200
 That's the only way it goes into space.

135
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,720
 If he doesn't like the smell, it does not go to space.

136
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:24,720
 This is the most powerful set of nostrils on our planet.

137
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,960
 And he gets test four times every year,

138
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,960
 where they put beakers of different smells under his nose.

139
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:32,720
 Some contain no smells, some contain a tiny trace.

140
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,760
 And if he fails, he loses his job.

141
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:36,120
 He has never failed.

142
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,720
 He's got the best nostrils on the planet.

143
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:39,880
 And even if he did fail, he's got a lucrative sneaker

144
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:42,080
 judging career to fall back on.

145
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:44,800
 And so the other thing that these guys do in the competition

146
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,680
 is that the entrant has to give a verbal response

147
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,440
 to the question, why he stroke she feels

148
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:53,040
 that he stroke she has rotten sneakers

149
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:55,280
 and how they got that way.

150
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,520
 And last year's winner, Ken Jung-Hiss,

151
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:01,240
 answered the question with, I bike and high coffin.

152
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,720
 I've worn them through mud.

153
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:07,200
 And also through chicken, pigeon, goose, and dove poop.

154
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,680
 And they also don't wear socks.

155
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:10,920
 [LAUGHTER]

156
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,160
 So that was her answer?

157
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,400
 Oh, the sock bit got you.

158
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:14,400
 That was--

159
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,680
 [LAUGHTER]

160
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:19,120
 Oh, yeah, and you get into the hall of fumes, don't you?

161
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,320
 The odouritas hall of fumes, if you win it.

162
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,760
 That's a very clever contest.

163
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:23,520
 No, that's actually true.

164
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,680
 There wasn't me making a really bad joke.

165
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:26,680
 [LAUGHTER]

166
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:28,000
 Where you go?

167
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,360
 Supposedly, the original trophy was an ancient Greek word.

168
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,640
 And it comes at Trophane, it's what it was originally.

169
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:37,240
 And it was when you hung your dead enemy's armor

170
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,960
 on a tree after a battle.

171
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,840
 So everyone could see that you had won.

172
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:42,200
 Yeah, nice.

173
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:44,320
 Have you guys heard of the Golden Colour Awards?

174
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:44,960
 No.

175
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:47,280
 Which are a really big deal, apparently.

176
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,200
 Every year, there's an award ceremony

177
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:52,280
 that follows the Oscars for the best dogs in films.

178
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,000
 Really?

179
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:53,680
 Yeah, yeah.

180
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,880
 And you get the same category.

181
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,720
 So you get the best dog in a theatrical film,

182
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,880
 which I think the dog in the artist

183
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:01,920
 won it in the year I was reading it out.

184
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,280
 RIP just passed away.

185
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,200
 Oh, no, no.

186
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:05,960
 Sorry.

187
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:06,800
 It's not breaking news.

188
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,040
 It happened ages ago, just no one knows,

189
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:08,760
 because no one cares.

190
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:11,000
 It's not like a--

191
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,280
 Well, after his death, he might have taken part

192
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:19,440
 in the UK's Good Funeral Awards, which is a real thing.

193
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:23,360
 Categories include Cemetery of the Year,

194
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:27,280
 Embarmer of the Year, Major Contribution

195
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,160
 to the Understanding of Death.

196
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,000
 Wow.

197
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,760
 Wow.

198
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:33,400
 And the final look at in my favorite

199
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,800
 is Grave Digger of the Year.

200
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,600
 [LAUGHTER]

201
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,800
 That's real.

202
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,440
 What is it to dig a good grave?

203
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:40,960
 Yeah.

204
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:41,680
 What is the qualifications?

205
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:42,680
 Is it like quality of policy?

206
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:43,440
 I don't know if it's a policy.

207
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:46,840
 Strength or speed or death?

208
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:47,600
 Death?

209
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,720
 I mean, because there's a famous term that sort of gives it

210
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:52,760
 a sort of bottom ceiling, as it were, 60.

211
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:54,640
 I don't like the phrase bottom ceiling at all.

212
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:55,640
 Yes.

213
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:57,640
 [LAUGHTER]

214
00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:04,320
 And I'm like, OK, we always lose that at some stage.

215
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:05,600
 It was a bit early today.

216
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,920
 Not really, tonight, yeah.

217
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:10,720
 So speaking of bottoms, something

218
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:13,840
 you could do with your bottom, relating to awards ceremonies,

219
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,680
 is be a seat filler at the Oscars, right?

220
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,320
 And I think we should try and do that.

221
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:19,720
 But so I think you can only get the job

222
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:22,000
 if you work for PWC, which sponsors the Oscars,

223
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,240
 or if you know someone involved.

224
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:26,240
 But it's because if the camera pans out to the audience

225
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:29,000
 and like, you know, live Tyler, or whoever's famous these days,

226
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,520
 goes to the toilet, then it looks like there's an empty seat.

227
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:32,880
 And so you've got to wait there in the wings.

228
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,400
 And as soon as the famous person stands up,

229
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,480
 then you've got to run into their seats

230
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:36,800
 in extra George Clooney for a bit.

231
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:38,200
 But your unrestricted instructions

232
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,760
 not to interact with any of the actual invitees.

233
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:42,080
 This isn't funny, but I have that.

234
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,680
 The national television awards.

235
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:46,200
 We went on stage, and then people came in our seats.

236
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,400
 And then afterwards, we had to--

237
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,640
 [LAUGHTER]

238
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:55,600
 I used to do that job weirdly.

239
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,720
 How I met everyone at QI was--

240
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:01,320
 [LAUGHTER]

241
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,640
 You told-- because I would have thought,

242
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,280
 if I'd gone and got an Oscar and gone back,

243
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:05,440
 and someone would stolen my seat.

244
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:09,520
 I'd just be like, what the fuck are you doing in my seat?

245
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:10,840
 I was reading an article about the Oscars.

246
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:11,960
 And they make about--

247
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,720
 I think it's about 50 every year.

248
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:14,360
 Yeah.

249
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:16,280
 And you're not allowed to sell them, either, are you?

250
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:18,560
 I thought you had to offer them back to the Academy Awards

251
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:19,360
 first for a dollar.

252
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,560
 For a long dollar, yeah.

253
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,880
 And then if the Academy Awards were like, oh,

254
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:24,080
 we can't really afford that, then--

255
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:27,280
 Then you can put your Oscar on the Ebay.

256
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:28,560
 We'd love to afford it, but unfortunately,

257
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:29,760
 we blew all the budget for this year

258
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:32,760
 on buying every woman who attends Magic for Dinosurgery.

259
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:35,880
 [LAUGHTER]

260
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:37,840
 And I have a few recursive things.

261
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:38,640
 Can I say those?

262
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,800
 So this is an award ceremony for awards.

263
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:44,760
 There's a village called Barton on the Water in Gloucestershire.

264
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:47,560
 And it has a one-nights scale exact replica

265
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:49,720
 of the village inside the village.

266
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:53,400
 But that replica also has a village inside of it.

267
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:56,440
 And that replica has a village inside of it.

268
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:59,040
 And the recursion stops after level four-- well, five,

269
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,640
 if you include the original village.

270
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:01,160
 Yeah.

271
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:03,600
 But yes, got five villages inside a village inside a village

272
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,520
 inside a village.

273
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:09,040
 Have you guys heard of Alice Brady, who won an Oscar in 1938?

274
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,440
 She won the Best Actress Oscar in Best Supporting Actress

275
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,280
 in a film called In Old Chicago.

276
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:15,360
 And she was unable to make it.

277
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,520
 So I think she was either on holiday or she was sick.

278
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:18,760
 Everyone knew she was unable to make it.

279
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:20,680
 So someone went and picked up the Oscar in her place

280
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:21,880
 at the ceremony.

281
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:24,160
 Turns out, no one knows who that person was.

282
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,880
 She had an sanction at all.

283
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:27,360
 And someone just walked over the Oscar.

284
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,920
 No one's ever found out where that is.

285
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:29,920
 Wow.

286
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:30,760
 I was.

287
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:32,160
 They just need to search for a person

288
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:34,880
 with vaginal surgery.

289
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,680
 Check it against all the records.

290
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:38,480
 Go ahead and search for that claim.

291
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:42,640
 Oh, you guys are not googling hard enough.

292
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,360
 Should we move on to our next act?

293
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:46,360
 OK, time for fact number two.

294
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:48,600
 And that is Andrew Hunter Murray.

295
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,760
 My fact is that Napoleon loved Rose

296
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:52,720
 chicken so much that his household chefs

297
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:57,600
 were constantly cooking some in case he decided he wanted any,

298
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,400
 which is my personal aim for my life.

299
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:02,080
 I think that's when you know you've made it.

300
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:04,760
 But so is this-- I mean, is there a lot of--

301
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:07,760
 is chicken sort of really, if you read an Napoleon biography,

302
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:08,600
 is it just everywhere?

303
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,240
 Is it just constant mentions of chicken?

304
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:10,760
 Or--

305
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:15,320
 Barely a page goes by in the 700 page Napoleon biography.

306
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:17,080
 He was more chicken than man by the end.

307
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:23,240
 No, I don't know, it's just something that was an article

308
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,520
 about it recently, which I spotted.

309
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:27,800
 This was at his palace in Paris, the twelery.

310
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:30,280
 And just chicken was constantly being cooked on a spit

311
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:32,000
 because he was very erratic in the way he ate.

312
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,480
 He would have meals at odd times of day.

313
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:38,680
 And he wasn't breakfast lunch and dinner sort of man.

314
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:41,440
 Once when he went on a journey from Cairo to--

315
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,120
 oh, where was it?

316
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,160
 I think Suez.

317
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:45,400
 He just took three roast chickens wrapped in paper

318
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:46,760
 as his provisions with him.

319
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:48,040
 So yeah, he loved it.

320
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:51,080
 Found it quite a cool Mussolini had a code word

321
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:54,160
 that he used to tell his wife whenever he was doing something

322
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,200
 at the table.

323
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:58,160
 And he didn't want his mother-in-law to know what he was doing.

324
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,040
 What was he doing at the table?

325
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:02,920
 Is it the same as what these people were doing at my awards?

326
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:05,160
 [LAUGHTER]

327
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:07,640
 Sorry, I should clarify, it's once he left the table

328
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:09,120
 that he started doing the thing.

329
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,160
 So he loved joling with swords.

330
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:13,440
 He was really obsessed with joling with swords.

331
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:16,480
 And so he got into fights all the time with people.

332
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,000
 Over just minor little things.

333
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,720
 And he would say at the breakfast table, to his wife,

334
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:25,680
 this was the line, today we are making spaghetti.

335
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:28,160
 And that was code to say, today I'm going outside

336
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:30,320
 to fight another man with swords.

337
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,000
 And I--

338
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:31,500
 Yeah.

339
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,880
 What happened if he actually was eating spaghetti one day?

340
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:35,800
 And then some guy just came at him with a sword

341
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,080
 because he thought it was a code.

342
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,160
 Yeah, and it's a confusing code.

343
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:38,680
 I agree.

344
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:40,960
 And also, I bet, at the same time, the mother-in-law,

345
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,600
 because she was living with them, would probably be going,

346
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,280
 ooh, spaghetti tonight then.

347
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:46,560
 And no matter what was the plans for dinner,

348
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:49,320
 would suddenly be changed, because Mussolini wanted a fight.

349
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:51,000
 You've just got a cooked man's hand here.

350
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,360
 What happened today with this spaghetti?

351
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,360
 How many secrets did he keep from his mother?

352
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,600
 Did he have a code for I'm going to enslave a nation

353
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,840
 and then go to war with various other nations?

354
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,040
 Was that--

355
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:04,040
 No, I'm going to feed the cat.

356
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:06,520
 Yeah, just as a side note to this fact,

357
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:09,280
 I found a website all about rabbits during the course

358
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:11,360
 of my research called Napoleon Bunny Part.

359
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,120
 Just so you knew.

360
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:18,880
 Was Napoleon once not attacked by rabbits?

361
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,000
 There is this story, yeah.

362
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,200
 And it's hard to know what's propaganda.

363
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:25,200
 It's been explained as his biggest ever defeat

364
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,680
 that he was attacked by bunnies on a battlefield

365
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:28,920
 and had to run away or something like that.

366
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:31,920
 Yeah, I thought it was when he was visiting Egypt, possibly.

367
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:34,960
 But yeah, he was mobbed by rabbits when he was out hunting

368
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:35,760
 while shooting.

369
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,840
 And people always think he's afraid of cats, don't they?

370
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:39,040
 Which I don't think is true.

371
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,680
 But I think they're confusing him with Napoleon

372
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:44,760
 and the third is nephew, who used to have to jump onto a table

373
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:47,840
 if a cat entered the room or like climb up the curtains

374
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:48,840
 to avoid it.

375
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:51,240
 That's one thing cats can do if they were cats.

376
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:53,240
 Yeah.

377
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:53,760
 That's weird.

378
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:54,560
 Not a smart man.

379
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:55,760
 That's why he doesn't have the--

380
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,840
 Yeah, the cute also to his uncle does.

381
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:00,400
 Josephine's dog really hated Napoleon.

382
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:00,920
 Yeah.

383
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:02,600
 And apparently during the wedding night,

384
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:05,600
 it bit him on the leg while he was asleep, not during the--

385
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:06,080
 OK.

386
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,880
 So they had a problem with animals, didn't they?

387
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,560
 I wonder if his actual--

388
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:11,560
 the rest of his life has actually distracted us

389
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:13,560
 from the fact that he was the one human on Earth who

390
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:15,680
 animals all hated unanimously.

391
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:18,600
 And we've been blinded to that actual real extraordinary fact

392
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:19,760
 about a man.

393
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,320
 There was another Napoleon.

394
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:24,280
 I think one of the very last members of Napoleon family

395
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:26,000
 are Jerome Bonaparte.

396
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
 Jerome Bonaparte?

397
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,800
 Jerome Bonaparte.

398
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,560
 They moved to New York.

399
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:31,760
 Or the fact no, they did.

400
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:34,720
 Guys, let's stop it.

401
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:38,240
 They escaped after the fall of Napoleon,

402
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,920
 lots of his family members with lots and lots of money.

403
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:42,240
 And one of them died.

404
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,920
 Jerome Bonaparte, I think it was, died

405
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:46,520
 after tripping over two entangled dog leads

406
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:47,560
 while out on a walk.

407
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:48,400
 Oh, my God.

408
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:49,040
 Oh.

409
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,040
 Yeah.

410
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:52,040
 Ooh.

411
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:54,840
 Well, also, he had problems with horse ride.

412
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:55,880
 I'm loving this theory.

413
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:57,280
 I really think you might be right.

414
00:14:57,280 --> 00:15:01,720
 So some historians speculate that the reason that he lost water

415
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:05,000
 glue is because he had incredibly bad hemorrhoids, which

416
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,080
 was a serious problem for him that repeated throughout his life,

417
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:09,560
 and that he couldn't sit on his horse throughout that day,

418
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:10,080
 which is due.

419
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:12,520
 So I think we don't have any evidence that he rode his horse.

420
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:15,200
 And so he couldn't survey the battlefield properly.

421
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:17,280
 And he couldn't ride his horses into battle.

422
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:19,200
 He had to stay backstage because he couldn't sit

423
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:19,720
 in a saddle.

424
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:20,600
 It was too painful.

425
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:21,440
 And there we go.

426
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,600
 That was the end of everything.

427
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:24,240
 So you just thought he were high enough?

428
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,480
 I mean, he wasn't that short.

429
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:27,760
 This is a myth that he was short, wasn't it?

430
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,800
 Yeah, he was kind of short.

431
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:33,520
 He was, I think he was an inch taller than Sarkozy.

432
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:34,040
 OK.

433
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:35,920
 But at the time, he was taller than the average Frenchman.

434
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:36,440
 Yes.

435
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:38,320
 He was taller than Nelson, I'm sorry to say.

436
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:41,840
 But it is weird how often I was reading a thing of first-hand

437
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:42,880
 sources about Napoleon.

438
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,560
 And it's weird how often people point out

439
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:46,280
 his small stature, given that we say

440
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:47,560
 that he was above average height.

441
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:50,360
 Maybe he just seems-- you know when you see someone who seems

442
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:52,040
 like their small, but actually they're six foot.

443
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:56,040
 Maybe he's just at a very small demeanor.

444
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:56,560
 I don't know.

445
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:59,040
 Why were people always going on about it?

446
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:01,880
 Can I tell you someone else who likes chicken?

447
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:02,400
 Yeah.

448
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:03,800
 Yeah.

449
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:07,680
 Is it-- is it-- I, James, like chicken.

450
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:10,360
 No, it's Stacy Irving from Birmingham, of course.

451
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:11,720
 She eats chicken nuggets.

452
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:12,920
 It's the only thing she eats.

453
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:14,680
 Chicken nuggets all the time.

454
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:18,240
 She has 20 a day that she shares with her boyfriend.

455
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:21,720
 And doxas have one that is very, very, very bad for her health,

456
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:22,960
 just eating chicken nuggets.

457
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:28,200
 I mean, if she shares them, she's not having 20 a day, then that's like--

458
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:30,760
 I mean, she is kind of like, it is really bad for her health.

459
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:32,240
 But the newspaper article said,

460
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,480
 a less serious consequence of her craving

461
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:37,240
 is that she's struggling to start all of the free toys

462
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:40,440
 that come with a fast food meal.

463
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:42,480
 So she might be dying, but yeah, where

464
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,600
 is she going to keep those toys?

465
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:45,080
 What is it?

466
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:47,640
 The world's largest chicken nugget is twice

467
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:49,640
 the size of the world's largest chicken nugget?

468
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:50,960
 I think it is.

469
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:52,000
 Whoa, really?

470
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
 Yeah.

471
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,120
 Imagine finding that in the box.

472
00:16:55,120 --> 00:17:00,960
 Someone else, actually, you'll probably

473
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:03,840
 know this Gary Watkinson from Huddersfield.

474
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:04,840
 Of course he is.

475
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:07,320
 He only eats beans on toast.

476
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:09,480
 That's the only thing he ever, ever eats.

477
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:11,920
 And it's from ever, since he can remember.

478
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:13,760
 But he actually said, the beans on toast thing

479
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:15,240
 is only more recent.

480
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:17,600
 Before that, it was just beans and toast separately.

481
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:26,400
 And then, like a second Einstein, one day,

482
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,840
 a moment of inspiration.

483
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:32,840
 [LAUGHTER]

484
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:35,760
 Yeah, Evonne Wake from the Nutrition Society said,

485
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:38,040
 Gary is probably not constipated.

486
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:39,520
 [LAUGHTER]

487
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:46,920
 I read it.

488
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:50,280
 So just on the subject of leaders and food.

489
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:53,720
 So a lot of leaders get given international gifts all the time.

490
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:55,680
 I'm thinking, in particular, of the American presidents.

491
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:59,800
 Two pandas were given to Nixon, that kind of thing.

492
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:03,880
 I discovered that LBJ, Lyndon B. Johnson,

493
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:09,800
 was given by an unnamed source, a Chinese chef called Mr. Wong,

494
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:12,120
 who just rocked up to the White House door.

495
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:14,040
 And he used to-- there's all these reports.

496
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:15,680
 No one really knew what he was doing there.

497
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:18,680
 Mr. Wong just lived with them during his term.

498
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,520
 They were trying to go to the holiday retreat that they

499
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:22,400
 go to, and they couldn't find Mr. Wong,

500
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,840
 because they were bringing him, because he decided

501
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:25,960
 to play hide-and-seek with the president.

502
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:29,400
 And they eventually found him behind some curtains

503
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,480
 after a good long search.

504
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:35,080
 But he was hiding from a cat to be there.

505
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:37,120
 That's a-- presidents aren't allowed to accept gifts

506
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,840
 that are worth more than something like $5.

507
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:41,920
 So he must have been an extremely cheap man.

508
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,160
 I don't know.

509
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:46,720
 Did you know that fittingly, someone bought--

510
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:49,160
 so Napoleon has two of those hats that survived

511
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:50,920
 in Napoleonic hats, and one of them

512
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:53,520
 was bought for 1.5 million pounds last year.

513
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:56,600
 And it was bought by a chicken mogul.

514
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:59,840
 It was bought by this Korean guy who

515
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:02,280
 owns a chain of chicken, fried chicken restaurants,

516
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:04,360
 the Ha Rim group, which I think provides

517
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:06,440
 fried chicken to the people of Korea.

518
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:09,640
 So on things of Napoleon's being sold,

519
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:15,400
 in 2006, one of Napoleon's teeth was sold for 11,000 pounds.

520
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:17,680
 In June, this year, a couple of months ago,

521
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:20,080
 a single one of Napoleon's hairs was sold at auction

522
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:21,480
 for 130 pounds.

523
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:23,800
 And I think we've said before on this podcast that,

524
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:27,000
 after he died, Napoleon's penis was removed and mummified,

525
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,200
 and has passed through several hands,

526
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,640
 and has been auctioned several times.

527
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:31,320
 But I have a theory that someone out there

528
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:33,040
 is reassembling Napoleon.

529
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:37,000
 [LAUGHTER]

530
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,160
 I think the hair thing is a small victory for Napoleon

531
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,120
 against Wellington.

532
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:43,320
 Because-- so later on, the hairs obviously

533
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:45,000
 depreciated in value, because in the '90s,

534
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:49,480
 a lock of Napoleon's hair sold for 3,680 pounds at auction.

535
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:53,160
 And I think the same year, Wellington's hair only got 598.

536
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:55,440
 So that's quite a nice-- it's like balances out

537
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:58,360
 the record between those guys.

538
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:00,560
 A penguin named Napoleon Boulder Parts

539
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:02,640
 has fallen in love with a Wellington boot.

540
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:06,000
 [LAUGHTER]

541
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,840
 Can you imagine if we don't know really what reincarnation is,

542
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:12,480
 but everything is conscious, and that's

543
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:15,080
 they're actually just having a-- sorry about that past life.

544
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:17,120
 I hope you're well.

545
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:18,320
 They never met, did they?

546
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:18,840
 Did they not?

547
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:19,680
 Never met.

548
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:23,840
 But so once the English had defeated the French,

549
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:26,040
 Wellington had an idea that he presented the British government

550
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:29,400
 that was disgust that rather than sent him into exile,

551
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:32,240
 they built him a house, really near Wellington's house,

552
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,160
 somewhere on the British coastline.

553
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:35,560
 And they lived near each other.

554
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:37,240
 And they just hang out on an exchange

555
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:40,280
 like strategic tips and anecdotes.

556
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:42,120
 I mean, what a great idea.

557
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:43,800
 Who can I boss that plan?

558
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:45,320
 Because that sounds fantastic.

559
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:47,640
 We've said on the show that Wellington was obsessed with Napoleon.

560
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:49,880
 He bought all of Napoleon's stuff after Waterloo.

561
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:52,160
 And he hired Napoleon's ex-cook.

562
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:54,840
 The mysterious and everlasting, Mr. Wong.

563
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:59,200
 [LAUGHTER]

564
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,720
 I'm going to have to move us on in a second.

565
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,160
 Has anyone got anything else?

566
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:04,080
 I've got one last thing.

567
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:06,520
 This is-- it's not particularly interesting or anything,

568
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:09,520
 but it's just a hard sell down, please.

569
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:10,840
 But sometimes you read a sentence.

570
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:13,480
 You think that's the best sentence I've read today.

571
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:14,280
 So it's just this.

572
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:17,320
 Stalin loved bananas and would be furious if you served him

573
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:18,520
 a substandard banana.

574
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:21,360
 [LAUGHTER]

575
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:23,680
 OK, it's time for fact number three.

576
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:24,960
 And that is my fact.

577
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:28,880
 My fact this week is that IMDB was originally just

578
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:33,200
 a list of actresses with beautiful eyes.

579
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:37,520
 It just started as this little list that the guy created.

580
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:39,280
 And he just thought, I need to put together

581
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:41,200
 a list of all the actresses that I think

582
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:43,440
 people need to know have beautiful eyes.

583
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,560
 And then people started going to and adding other lists.

584
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:47,000
 And then IMDB grew out of it.

585
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
 And it was called "Those Eyes" to begin with.

586
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,440
 That's the original name.

587
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:50,960
 Wow.

588
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:53,360
 The way it brought his Colneedman brought together two things

589
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:54,880
 to turn them into IMDB.

590
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:57,520
 And people often say, IMDB grew out of this list of women

591
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:58,640
 with beautiful eyes.

592
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,680
 And what he brought together was, one of those things

593
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:03,000
 was the list of actresses with beautiful eyes.

594
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,640
 And then the other thing he brought in, just a little addon,

595
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:07,680
 was a list that someone else had created, which

596
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:10,520
 was a movie ratings report, where participants were asked

597
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:12,560
 to rate movies on a 1 to 10 scale.

598
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:15,680
 But it was mainly based IMDB on the actresses

599
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:16,560
 with beautiful eyes.

600
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:18,400
 I mean, it sounds like the actresses with beautiful eyes

601
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,800
 was kind of a random, irrelevant list

602
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:22,360
 that just happened outside it.

603
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:23,680
 He sort of put them all together.

604
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:25,960
 He recalls the details of every film that he sees.

605
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:28,440
 And he has done since he was 13 years old Colneedman.

606
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:30,800
 And he has seen-- this was 18 months ago.

607
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:31,800
 So he's seen more since then.

608
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:35,640
 But at that count, it was 8,505.

609
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:39,080
 That's one film for every 48 hours since he was born.

610
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:40,800
 Wow.

611
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:42,320
 His favorite film is "Vertigo."

612
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:43,120
 Really?

613
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:45,680
 And that's why it always tops the charts.

614
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:46,520
 Yes.

615
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:48,000
 He's rigging it, isn't he?

616
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,320
 Because it's a good film.

617
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:53,040
 But I read an article that said that he and his--

618
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:54,160
 it was a quote by him.

619
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:57,040
 He said that he and his wife love going to the cinema.

620
00:22:57,040 --> 00:23:00,600
 And they watch a film together every Tuesday lunchtime.

621
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:02,480
 But what it sounds like is they do do that.

622
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:04,440
 But the rest of the time, it's just him watching loads

623
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:05,440
 of other movies.

624
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:07,760
 So it's more like, my wife has begrudgingly agreed

625
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:09,880
 to come to the cinema with me once a week.

626
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:11,680
 Otherwise, we would never see each other.

627
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:13,520
 [LAUGHTER]

628
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:15,800
 And when he was a boy, he rented out the film Alien.

629
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:17,920
 And he watched it every single day for a fortnight.

630
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:18,400
 Wow.

631
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,440
 That's a waste of his time.

632
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,520
 He needs to be getting through these films.

633
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:22,320
 Yeah.

634
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:24,320
 Well, he said that recently there are so many more good films

635
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:25,640
 being made these days.

636
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:27,640
 It was just that at the time that was one of the best films

637
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:28,160
 ever made.

638
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:29,480
 And it was so huge.

639
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:31,320
 It is a fantastic place.

640
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:33,640
 I actually do a fair bit of QI research

641
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:35,000
 by looking at the IMDB.

642
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,240
 Did you know section?

643
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:39,560
 I love reading the user reviews, because the honesty of it

644
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:41,200
 is just, here's my favorite one.

645
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:44,640
 I haven't even read further than the title of this review.

646
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:47,040
 But it was for the movie Batman and Robin.

647
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:49,840
 And the headline was, I lost faith in humanity.

648
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:53,680
 [LAUGHTER]

649
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:54,680
 Sign the Joker.

650
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:56,840
 [LAUGHTER]

651
00:23:56,840 --> 00:24:00,520
 Do you know what is the bottom ranked movie on all of IMDB?

652
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:01,360
 No.

653
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:04,680
 It's called Jurassic Shark.

654
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:06,040
 It's from 2012.

655
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:08,680
 It's got a rating of 1.5%.

656
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:09,760
 And here's what it is.

657
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:12,400
 It's, when an oil company on Wittingly Unleashes,

658
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:15,760
 a prehistoric shark from its icy prison,

659
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:18,680
 the Jurassic Killan maroons a group of thieves

660
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:21,640
 and a beautiful young female college student

661
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:24,520
 on an abandoned piece of land.

662
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:26,520
 How did they manage to screw that up, though?

663
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:28,480
 Because that sounds like such a winning.

664
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:29,160
 This film.

665
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:32,440
 I'll give you some others in the bottom, like 20 or something.

666
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:35,320
 The Hottie and the Nottie from 2008.

667
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:37,280
 Oh, it's a Paris Hilton movie.

668
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:39,000
 Oh, is it?

669
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:39,600
 Apparently.

670
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:42,960
 Apparently.

671
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:45,640
 I think we found that why it's not at the absolute bottom.

672
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:47,880
 [LAUGHTER]

673
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:50,840
 Do you know the-- so there's one film on IMDB which

674
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:54,360
 isn't marked out of 10, which is Spinal Tap,

675
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:57,720
 and the IMDB page marks that it's rating as marked out of 11.

676
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:59,400
 So it gives 8 out of 11.

677
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:00,200
 Which, and then--

678
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:02,120
 Oh, which actually really affects how good a movie it is

679
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:03,280
 in the overall rating because--

680
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:04,600
 Yeah, so it's really annoying because I worry

681
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:06,200
 that people have a notice, and they're giving it an 8,

682
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:07,960
 thinking that's out of 10, and that's 80%.

683
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:08,520
 But it's not.

684
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:10,760
 It's obviously X% that I'm not going to patronize you

685
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:12,960
 by working out here myself right now.

686
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:16,680
 [LAUGHTER]

687
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:18,240
 Yeah, it's a lower percent.

688
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:18,760
 Yeah.

689
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:20,560
 It should be higher than 8 out of 11.

690
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:24,960
 I read them at cracked.com article about the most depressing

691
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,800
 IMDB pages.

692
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:29,720
 Their top one was someone called Leslie Bremer,

693
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:32,800
 and she's only had nine roles in her whole career.

694
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:37,280
 They include Girl in Bikini, Shower Girl, Party Girl,

695
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:40,760
 and Girl Leaving Room.

696
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:43,880
 She's only had one named party in her entire career,

697
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:48,080
 and she played Sandy in a movie called School Spirit.

698
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:50,760
 But on IMDB, it says, in several scenes,

699
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:54,280
 actress Leslie can be seen wearing a necklace with the letter L

700
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:57,680
 on it, despite the fact that her character's name is Sandy.

701
00:25:57,680 --> 00:26:01,040
 [LAUGHTER]

702
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:02,560
 I'm going to have to move us on in a sec.

703
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:04,160
 We're going to power through to the last one.

704
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,320
 Anyone got anything else?

705
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:08,200
 I looked up IMDB's current poll of actresses

706
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:10,360
 with beautiful eyes, and it's just a list.

707
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:11,280
 It's really weird.

708
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:13,640
 So there are lots of people who submitted their own lists,

709
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:15,280
 but their own curator ones.

710
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:17,960
 But this one's a poll which takes others users into account.

711
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:21,360
 So the top 20 is all people like Cameron Diaz, Rachel Fies,

712
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:23,640
 Natalie Portman, other people like that.

713
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:25,800
 And then Joan Plarrite is in there, who--

714
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:27,160
 I don't know if you know who that is, but I mean,

715
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:28,280
 she's 85 years old.

716
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:30,760
 She is a kind of famous stage actress.

717
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:33,280
 She's often in things like Inspector Morse playing

718
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:35,480
 a servant woman.

719
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:37,000
 But does she have a really nice eyes?

720
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,840
 I looked really hard, and to be honest,

721
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:42,120
 I found it hard to see what they're talking about.

722
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:43,680
 Everyone's got nice eyes.

723
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:45,320
 I mean, just eyes are nice, aren't they?

724
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:46,320
 Yeah.

725
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:47,320
 How long?

726
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:48,320
 OK.

727
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:50,400
 You know, you can say someone's got nice hair

728
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:54,280
 or not very nice hair, but eyes are just nice to look at.

729
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:56,840
 Everyone likes looking at a knife.

730
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:58,520
 I've seen some bad eyes.

731
00:26:58,520 --> 00:26:59,360
 Have you?

732
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:01,120
 There were some really bad eyes.

733
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:03,080
 I have a couple of facts about eyes if you want them.

734
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:04,840
 Yeah, fact number one, eyes are lovely.

735
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:13,520
 Fact number two, the first person known to have had blue eyes

736
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:14,960
 was we know who it was.

737
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:16,520
 So it was 7,000 years ago.

738
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:19,640
 It was a caveman living in Spain, because it's a mutation.

739
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:22,200
 So everyone who's got blue eyes can trace the ancestry back

740
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:24,200
 to that particular individual.

741
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:26,280
 I wonder if everyone just went to that cave

742
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:30,080
 and then went, you have beautiful eyes.

743
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:33,880
 And then Andy went, everyone has a beautiful eyes.

744
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:36,320
 OK, it's time for our final fact of the show.

745
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:38,600
 And that is Chosinski.

746
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:43,200
 Yes, my fact is that the word fascinate literally

747
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:47,400
 means the embodiment of the divine fallace.

748
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:49,680
 Certainly the sense in which I use it all the time.

749
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:54,480
 So this is the etymology of fascinate.

750
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:56,760
 It comes from the Latin word fascinum, which

751
00:27:56,760 --> 00:28:00,880
 was either fascinus the phallic god, which we know very little

752
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:05,280
 about, or it was a phallic object that you carry around

753
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:07,680
 for good luck, which they did a lot of the time.

754
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:09,920
 I just like to ward off the evil eye or something like that.

755
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:10,440
 Yeah, exactly.

756
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:13,440
 So the verb fascinari in Latin was

757
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:17,440
 to use the power of the phallus to either ward off the evil eye

758
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:19,760
 or to hypnotize someone in an evil manner.

759
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:21,960
 So if you're fascinating somebody,

760
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:24,280
 you are using the power of the phallus.

761
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:26,720
 And what would a cast a spell on them?

762
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:28,520
 This is what Dan was doing at that award ceremony.

763
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:30,080
 Yeah.

764
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:32,560
 So I spent most of today googling penises

765
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:33,560
 of fascinating.

766
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:38,080
 And it's a lot out there.

767
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:39,480
 All penises are beautiful.

768
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:48,080
 Well, back in back May last year, James

769
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:52,120
 and I were in the office alone together.

770
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:54,200
 And we kind of ran out of conversation.

771
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:57,120
 And this is kind of--

772
00:28:57,120 --> 00:29:00,040
 This is really not the time, not the place for this.

773
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:02,200
 People need to know.

774
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:04,000
 So we kind of just ran out of conversation.

775
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:07,680
 And James, just in a way to sort of just spark up conversation,

776
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:09,880
 just looked up to me and said, hey, do you know that there

777
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:13,440
 was over 600 guys in the world with two dicks?

778
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:15,160
 And as if that was like, oh, good, we're back in.

779
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:17,160
 We have a conversation going on.

780
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:18,040
 And I googled it.

781
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:22,080
 And there were 600 men in the world who have two penises.

782
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:24,680
 And on Reddit, there's a website Reddit.

783
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:26,640
 They have that thing, AMA.

784
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,080
 And AMA asked me anything.

785
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:29,560
 One of the most successful things I ever had

786
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:32,560
 was someone coming on saying, I have two penises.

787
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:33,480
 Ask me anything.

788
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:35,880
 It was what bit where it an interview was talking about.

789
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:38,000
 It says, the most upsetting moment for him

790
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,920
 was a girl he dated.

791
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:43,120
 Seriously, he got-- he was over one night stands.

792
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:44,240
 And they dated for three months.

793
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:45,600
 They were just kissing and cuddling.

794
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,440
 She finally was ready.

795
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:49,880
 I'd put it off for another month after that.

796
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:51,720
 But when it came down to it, I told her

797
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:54,280
 that I was built different from other guys.

798
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:56,520
 So I was sort of slightly built different.

799
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:58,000
 She said she didn't care.

800
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,280
 I revealed them to her.

801
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:01,040
 And she said she definitely cared.

802
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:04,880
 [LAUGHTER]

803
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:08,920
 Only she had known that all penises are beautiful.

804
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:11,440
 There was a guy that used to freak shows

805
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:12,560
 in the 19th century.

806
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:14,080
 And there was one guy called--

807
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:17,360
 I think he's called like Dos Santos or something like that.

808
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:20,680
 And he was known as the man with two swords.

809
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:23,520
 And he used to show himself off as a man with two penises.

810
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:27,400
 And he married a woman called Blanche Duma

811
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:28,400
 or something like that.

812
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:29,840
 She called two scabbards or something.

813
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:37,000
 [LAUGHTER]

814
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,720
 No, she-- but she did have two vaginas, yeah.

815
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:41,600
 What?

816
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:44,760
 There's someone out there for everybody.

817
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:47,360
 OK, this was a fact about etymology.

818
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:48,360
 Oh, yeah.

819
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:49,320
 Sorry, sorry.

820
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:51,440
 Yeah, back to Roman penises, at least,

821
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:53,280
 because that's more highbrow, I think.

822
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:55,480
 They were more highbrow then.

823
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:59,520
 So the age of nine days, Roman boys

824
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:02,960
 would be given an amulet with a phallus inside it.

825
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:05,400
 And that was to ward off the evil eye.

826
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:06,160
 That was the point of it.

827
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:07,680
 And they'd have to go around wearing this amulet

828
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:10,440
 with a phallus inside it until they came of age.

829
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:12,200
 Because they weren't really-- they weren't as obscene

830
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:13,800
 as they are now, although they weren't seen as being obscene,

831
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:15,360
 because of this old good luck thing.

832
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:17,160
 Yeah, and also getting rid of this evil eye,

833
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:20,400
 it was really thought to be a really serious thing.

834
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:23,720
 There's a Roman mosaic of a phallus ejaculating

835
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:26,560
 into a disembodied eye.

836
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:29,440
 Wikipedia described it as a relief.

837
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:38,120
 So have you seen the relief?

838
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:39,680
 I've seen it.

839
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:41,160
 So it's pretty--

840
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:41,840
 It's so weird.

841
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:44,120
 The phallus has its own penis, which

842
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:45,600
 is doing the ejaculating.

843
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:49,040
 So it's a lovely stone-carved relief, as James says.

844
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:50,920
 And I think it's in Turkey.

845
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:53,640
 And it's a phallus with back legs.

846
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:56,160
 And then there's a smaller penis coming down from it.

847
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:58,080
 And it's shooting ejaculating into an eye

848
00:31:58,080 --> 00:31:59,640
 with a scorpion on top of it.

849
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:00,680
 Amazing.

850
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:02,600
 I like the penis with the little penis.

851
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:04,640
 It's like that village in Gloucestershire.

852
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:07,640
 Yes.

853
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:11,480
 I mean, not exactly like that.

854
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:14,280
 Roman prostitutes sold things called colifio,

855
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:17,120
 which were little bread rolls shaped like penises.

856
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:17,760
 That's a bay.

857
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:18,760
 Yeah.

858
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:21,720
 And you don't get that in Gregg's, do you?

859
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:27,400
 It was a clarify that Gregg's is not

860
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:30,200
 a staffed excuse me if I prostitutes.

861
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:35,520
 Yes, I would like to try.

862
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:38,160
 That's why you keep getting injected from Gregg's James.

863
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:43,760
 So there's a theory that the reason we don't know very much

864
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:47,000
 about fascinus is that Christians tried

865
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,480
 to eradicate from our collective memory

866
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:51,600
 all the weird stuff that the Romans were interested in,

867
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:52,960
 like this, because they thought it was a bit

868
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:53,880
 prudish.

869
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:55,320
 But there's another god called--

870
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:57,720
 has a really good name-- called Moutunus Tutunus.

871
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:58,560
 And he--

872
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:01,640
 [LAUGHTER]

873
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:03,000
 Sorry.

874
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,400
 I was midship, and then it was the best day

875
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:06,080
 by the way.

876
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:07,040
 Yeah, yeah.

877
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:08,040
 What was that?

878
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:10,600
 Moutunus Tutunus.

879
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:13,880
 Mouti Tutu, and nobody ever called him.

880
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:16,160
 And he was sort of a god of fertility.

881
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:20,280
 And so there was a tradition in which there would be sculptures

882
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:23,240
 of Moutunus Tutunus, and he had a large phallus,

883
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:25,200
 because that was what he represented.

884
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:28,880
 And it has been written that Roman brides

885
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:31,600
 to prepare themselves for marriage

886
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:34,280
 would have to straddle the phallus of Moutunus

887
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:37,400
 to prepare themselves for the upcoming intercourse.

888
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:38,600
 He was a dildo.

889
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:40,560
 [LAUGHTER]

890
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:44,760
 Mouti Tutu, the first dildo.

891
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:50,080
 If that's not in the goodie bags at next year's Oscar's eye,

892
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:51,720
 you're going to turn down your award.

893
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:56,520
 This person is called Faskinus.

894
00:33:56,520 --> 00:34:00,560
 And another word that comes from this guy, whose name

895
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:06,360
 means penis, is fascist, because originally

896
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:10,120
 it came from Fasky Sicilianie de Levittori,

897
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:13,600
 and the word Fasky came from meaning a group.

898
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:15,480
 And that originally was like a bundle,

899
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:17,600
 but it also had the same kind of connotations

900
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:19,080
 as something large and whatever.

901
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:21,040
 And that was where the word fascist came from.

902
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:23,520
 What Faskers rods of office, literally,

903
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:27,000
 that Roman officials carried to show their authority?

904
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,560
 So basically, all fascists are dicks.

905
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:33,120
 [LAUGHTER]

906
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:36,840
 If I were you, the rest, you didn't really get into that way.

907
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:39,360
 Audience fascists here tonight.

908
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:41,520
 I feel like I'm going to be making a lot of spaghetti this evening.

909
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:46,000
 [LAUGHTER]

910
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:51,520
 I read, I discovered a new martial art discipline today.

911
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:54,160
 It's called 99 Power Chi Gong.

912
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:55,280
 So it's part of Chi Gong.

913
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:59,280
 It's one of the rarer, practiced bits of Chi Gong and martial

914
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:00,160
 arts.

915
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:02,720
 Its other name is Iron Crotch.

916
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:04,840
 Men of a certain age, suddenly need

917
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:07,880
 to start attaching lots of really heavy things to the dick

918
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:11,120
 and allow it to just get some exercise.

919
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:12,840
 I think that's the kind of thing.

920
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:14,000
 There's a guy called Master 2.

921
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,360
 He goes around the world, teaching people how to do this.

922
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:18,600
 He's described on his website as a graceful man

923
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:21,240
 who moves like a swimming dragon with sudden bursts

924
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:22,600
 of thunderous gestures.

925
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:24,200
 But what he's mainly known for is that he

926
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:26,960
 can tow trucks with his penis.

927
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:28,440
 What's wrong with a tow rope?

928
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:30,400
 [LAUGHTER]

929
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:33,080
 Well, I'm just only mentioning it in case anyone's

930
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:35,280
 looking for an interesting Christmas gift to give the someone,

931
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:38,680
 because you can buy Iron Crotch the DVD, which is,

932
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:41,280
 like those exercise DVDs that you get.

933
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:46,080
 And it comes with a rope and a hook to hook.

934
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:47,160
 And you'll be able to find that.

935
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:48,840
 I know such thing as a fish.com.

936
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:53,840
 This Christmas, along with your motunus to tunus still though.

937
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:58,160
 And a free copy of Jurassic Shark.

938
00:35:58,160 --> 00:35:59,840
 OK, I'm going to have to stop us there.

939
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:00,680
 OK, that's it.

940
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:01,640
