00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.520
 Hey, everybody, Dan here.

00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:03.680
 Welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish.

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:05.340
 Before we begin this week's episode,

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:06.920
 we have a big announcement.

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:10.000
 We have signed to an indie label

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.400
 because we are releasing a vinyl.

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:14.560
 We genuinely are releasing a vinyl.

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:16.920
 It's an exclusive episode we've recorded.

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.840
 And if you buy it, you'll get a remastered version

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:21.680
 of our first 52 episodes.

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:24.040
 That's the first year of No Such Thing as a Fish.

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:25.960
 We're doing this through Alcopot Records.

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:29.440
 You can go to qi.com/fishvinyl

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:30.720
 and do pre-orders now.

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.480
 There's a limited edition completely yellow vinyl.

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.720
 The vinyl itself is going to be completely yellow.

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:38.160
 And we're going to be launching it properly for sale

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.960
 on the 20th of November.

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.840
 If you'd like to come to our launch night,

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:43.600
 that's going to be the live podcast recording

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.920
 we're doing at the Lyric Theater in London's West End.

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:47.080
 It's our biggest gig ever.

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:48.480
 It's a thousand seeder.

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.040
 Hopefully you can come and pick up a vinyl.

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:53.520
 And also, speaking of the Lyric Theater event,

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.960
 as another string to our rock and roll bow,

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:00.200
 we are on tour and we'd love to see any

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:03.360
 and/or all of you at one of our tour date venues.

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:06.760
 So if you go to qi.com/fishvents,

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:09.000
 you can see all the venues that are confirmed so far.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.800
 We're going to be in Manchester.

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:12.080
 We're going to Brighton.

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:16.200
 We are going to Glasgow, Leeds, Bristol, Birmingham.

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.920
 So yeah, come along.

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:18.840
 On with the show.

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.560
 [funky music]

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:35.040
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.280
 a weekly podcast this week coming to you

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:39.280
 from the Edinburgh Fringe Festival.

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:40.920
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.240
 Joining me is ever the three qi elves.

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:45.400
 Please welcome to the stage is Andy Murray,

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:48.120
 Anacisinsky, and James Harkin.

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:50.960
 [cheers and applause]

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:56.760
 And once again, we've gathered around the microphones

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:59.160
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:01.640
 and in no particular order, here we go.

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:03.800
 Starting with you, James Harkin.

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:07.320
 Okay, my fact this week is that Las Vegas hosts

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.200
 an awards ceremony for people who make awards.

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.680
 [laughter]

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.160
 What do they get?

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:17.600
 They get a gold obelisk.

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:19.280
 Oh, that's good, isn't it?

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:22.000
 It's the awards and personalization association

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.280
 and they celebrate things like best trophy.

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:26.280
 That gets an award.

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:27.600
 Best plaque.

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:28.280
 That gets one.

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:29.040
 Best plaque.

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:29.840
 Best plaque.

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:31.960
 And a best sandblasting.

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:33.480
 That's one.

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:34.240
 What is that?

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:35.000
 I didn't look it up.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.880
 [laughter]

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:40.560
 Yeah, the US and Canada industry for awards

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.800
 is $3 billion a year.

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:44.800
 That's how much people spend on awards.

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:47.640
 And that I worked it out is enough to give every person

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:51.160
 in the country a three to five inch resin trophy

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:52.840
 in the spot of their choice.

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:55.840
 [laughter]

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:58.800
 That seems a much better way of doing it.

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:00.760
 Just do away with all the games and spots.

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:01.840
 Just give everyone a trophy.

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:02.680
 Yeah.

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:03.440
 You're great.

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:04.640
 That's amazing.

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:06.760
 That's because, well, they aren't hugely money, don't they?

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:08.360
 The Oscars, we might have talked about this before,

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:10.200
 the Oscars, the party bag that you get

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.000
 if you're attending the Oscars is extraordinary.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.240
 It's worth something like 120 grand per bag.

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:17.600
 Last year's or the year before's came with every female

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:20.880
 who'd attended a got in their party bag,

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:22.520
 genitals stimulator, I think.

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:25.680
 Also, no, it was surgery that can be performed on you

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:27.520
 in order that you have better orgasms.

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:29.240
 And every woman who attended the Oscars

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:32.560
 got a little voucher for one of these surgeries.

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:34.560
 [laughter]

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:36.280
 So yeah, it's good to, it's better than the party bags

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:37.280
 of youth.

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:39.320
 [laughter]

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:41.520
 Yeah, it's not a balloon and a bit of cake wrapped

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:43.520
 in the tissue, is it?

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:46.240
 Mind you, I think you'd be in trouble at a child birthday party, yeah?

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:50.560
 [laughter]

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:52.680
 I started looking up some other awards ceremonies

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:54.480
 that the UK has based on this fact.

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:58.920
 And you might like to know that there is a British cabab awards

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:03.280
 where categories include best newcomer cabab restaurant

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:07.560
 and outstanding contribution to the cabab industry,

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:09.400
 which this year, I'm sure we all know,

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:14.120
 was one by Edmonton Meat.

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:16.320
 How are the acceptance speeches for that?

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:18.960
 You just have to slowly turn around as you make a speech.

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:22.200
 [laughter]

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:24.600
 Another award ceremony that they have,

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:27.320
 which I think the prize for this is enormous,

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:28.560
 given the nature of it.

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:33.600
 So the smelly foot contest, the reiki foot competition

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:36.840
 for which is called the sneaker contest, the sneaker contest.

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:40.440
 And the winner every year gets $2,500,

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:43.800
 as well as two nights in New York and a trip to a Broadway show,

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:45.000
 which just approving that you're happy to say.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.200
 But having smelly feet.

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:46.800
 Yeah.

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:48.200
 How's it judged?

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:50.200
 It's the panel of judges.

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:51.400
 I can tell you how it's judged,

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:54.000
 because I actually coincidentally googled this as well.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.280
 [laughter]

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:58.680
 They check the condition of your heel of your shoe,

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:01.920
 the sole, the tongue, the shoelaces,

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:05.120
 the older of the shoe, which is tested by a group of people,

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:07.120
 one of whom is NASA's sniffer.

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:08.280
 No.

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:11.120
 The guy who smells everything before it goes up in space.

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:12.960
 Oh, this guy's incredible.

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:15.680
 Nothing goes into space unless he goes under his nose.

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:16.920
 And he goes, yep.

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:19.200
 That's the only way it goes into space.

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:21.720
 If he doesn't like the smell, it does not go to space.

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:24.720
 This is the most powerful set of nostrils on our planet.

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:26.960
 And he gets test four times every year,

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:29.960
 where they put beakers of different smells under his nose.

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:32.720
 Some contain no smells, some contain a tiny trace.

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:34.760
 And if he fails, he loses his job.

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:36.120
 He has never failed.

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:37.720
 He's got the best nostrils on the planet.

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:39.880
 And even if he did fail, he's got a lucrative sneaker

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:42.080
 judging career to fall back on.

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:44.800
 And so the other thing that these guys do in the competition

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:47.680
 is that the entrant has to give a verbal response

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:50.440
 to the question, why he stroke she feels

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:53.040
 that he stroke she has rotten sneakers

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:55.280
 and how they got that way.

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:57.520
 And last year's winner, Ken Jung-Hiss,

00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:01.240
 answered the question with, I bike and high coffin.

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:02.720
 I've worn them through mud.

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:07.200
 And also through chicken, pigeon, goose, and dove poop.

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:08.680
 And they also don't wear socks.

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:10.920
 [LAUGHTER]

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:12.160
 So that was her answer?

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:13.400
 Oh, the sock bit got you.

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:14.400
 That was--

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:16.680
 [LAUGHTER]

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:19.120
 Oh, yeah, and you get into the hall of fumes, don't you?

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:21.320
 The odouritas hall of fumes, if you win it.

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:22.760
 That's a very clever contest.

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:23.520
 No, that's actually true.

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:25.680
 There wasn't me making a really bad joke.

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:26.680
 [LAUGHTER]

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:28.000
 Where you go?

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.360
 Supposedly, the original trophy was an ancient Greek word.

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:33.640
 And it comes at Trophane, it's what it was originally.

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:37.240
 And it was when you hung your dead enemy's armor

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:38.960
 on a tree after a battle.

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:40.840
 So everyone could see that you had won.

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:42.200
 Yeah, nice.

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:44.320
 Have you guys heard of the Golden Colour Awards?

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:44.960
 No.

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:47.280
 Which are a really big deal, apparently.

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:49.200
 Every year, there's an award ceremony

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:52.280
 that follows the Oscars for the best dogs in films.

00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:53.000
 Really?

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:53.680
 Yeah, yeah.

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:54.880
 And you get the same category.

00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:57.720
 So you get the best dog in a theatrical film,

00:06:57.720 --> 00:06:59.880
 which I think the dog in the artist

00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:01.920
 won it in the year I was reading it out.

00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:03.280
 RIP just passed away.

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:05.200
 Oh, no, no.

00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:05.960
 Sorry.

00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:06.800
 It's not breaking news.

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:08.040
 It happened ages ago, just no one knows,

00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:08.760
 because no one cares.

00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:11.000
 It's not like a--

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.280
 Well, after his death, he might have taken part

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:19.440
 in the UK's Good Funeral Awards, which is a real thing.

00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:23.360
 Categories include Cemetery of the Year,

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:27.280
 Embarmer of the Year, Major Contribution

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:29.160
 to the Understanding of Death.

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:30.000
 Wow.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:31.760
 Wow.

00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:33.400
 And the final look at in my favorite

00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:34.800
 is Grave Digger of the Year.

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:37.600
 [LAUGHTER]

00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:38.800
 That's real.

00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:40.440
 What is it to dig a good grave?

00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:40.960
 Yeah.

00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:41.680
 What is the qualifications?

00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:42.680
 Is it like quality of policy?

00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:43.440
 I don't know if it's a policy.

00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:46.840
 Strength or speed or death?

00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:47.600
 Death?

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:49.720
 I mean, because there's a famous term that sort of gives it

00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:52.760
 a sort of bottom ceiling, as it were, 60.

00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:54.640
 I don't like the phrase bottom ceiling at all.

00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:55.640
 Yes.

00:07:55.640 --> 00:07:57.640
 [LAUGHTER]

00:07:57.640 --> 00:08:04.320
 And I'm like, OK, we always lose that at some stage.

00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:05.600
 It was a bit early today.

00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:06.920
 Not really, tonight, yeah.

00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:10.720
 So speaking of bottoms, something

00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:13.840
 you could do with your bottom, relating to awards ceremonies,

00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:15.680
 is be a seat filler at the Oscars, right?

00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:17.320
 And I think we should try and do that.

00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:19.720
 But so I think you can only get the job

00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:22.000
 if you work for PWC, which sponsors the Oscars,

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:23.240
 or if you know someone involved.

00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:26.240
 But it's because if the camera pans out to the audience

00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:29.000
 and like, you know, live Tyler, or whoever's famous these days,

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.520
 goes to the toilet, then it looks like there's an empty seat.

00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:32.880
 And so you've got to wait there in the wings.

00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:34.400
 And as soon as the famous person stands up,

00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:35.480
 then you've got to run into their seats

00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:36.800
 in extra George Clooney for a bit.

00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:38.200
 But your unrestricted instructions

00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:40.760
 not to interact with any of the actual invitees.

00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:42.080
 This isn't funny, but I have that.

00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:43.680
 The national television awards.

00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:46.200
 We went on stage, and then people came in our seats.

00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:47.400
 And then afterwards, we had to--

00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:49.640
 [LAUGHTER]

00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:55.600
 I used to do that job weirdly.

00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:57.720
 How I met everyone at QI was--

00:08:57.720 --> 00:09:01.320
 [LAUGHTER]

00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:02.640
 You told-- because I would have thought,

00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:04.280
 if I'd gone and got an Oscar and gone back,

00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:05.440
 and someone would stolen my seat.

00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:09.520
 I'd just be like, what the fuck are you doing in my seat?

00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:10.840
 I was reading an article about the Oscars.

00:09:10.840 --> 00:09:11.960
 And they make about--

00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:13.720
 I think it's about 50 every year.

00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:14.360
 Yeah.

00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:16.280
 And you're not allowed to sell them, either, are you?

00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:18.560
 I thought you had to offer them back to the Academy Awards

00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:19.360
 first for a dollar.

00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:20.560
 For a long dollar, yeah.

00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:21.880
 And then if the Academy Awards were like, oh,

00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:24.080
 we can't really afford that, then--

00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:27.280
 Then you can put your Oscar on the Ebay.

00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:28.560
 We'd love to afford it, but unfortunately,

00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:29.760
 we blew all the budget for this year

00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:32.760
 on buying every woman who attends Magic for Dinosurgery.

00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:35.880
 [LAUGHTER]

00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:37.840
 And I have a few recursive things.

00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:38.640
 Can I say those?

00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:40.800
 So this is an award ceremony for awards.

00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:44.760
 There's a village called Barton on the Water in Gloucestershire.

00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:47.560
 And it has a one-nights scale exact replica

00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:49.720
 of the village inside the village.

00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:53.400
 But that replica also has a village inside of it.

00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:56.440
 And that replica has a village inside of it.

00:09:56.440 --> 00:09:59.040
 And the recursion stops after level four-- well, five,

00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:00.640
 if you include the original village.

00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:01.160
 Yeah.

00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:03.600
 But yes, got five villages inside a village inside a village

00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:04.520
 inside a village.

00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:09.040
 Have you guys heard of Alice Brady, who won an Oscar in 1938?

00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:11.440
 She won the Best Actress Oscar in Best Supporting Actress

00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:13.280
 in a film called In Old Chicago.

00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:15.360
 And she was unable to make it.

00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:17.520
 So I think she was either on holiday or she was sick.

00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:18.760
 Everyone knew she was unable to make it.

00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:20.680
 So someone went and picked up the Oscar in her place

00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:21.880
 at the ceremony.

00:10:21.880 --> 00:10:24.160
 Turns out, no one knows who that person was.

00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:25.880
 She had an sanction at all.

00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:27.360
 And someone just walked over the Oscar.

00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:28.920
 No one's ever found out where that is.

00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:29.920
 Wow.

00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:30.760
 I was.

00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:32.160
 They just need to search for a person

00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:34.880
 with vaginal surgery.

00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:36.680
 Check it against all the records.

00:10:36.680 --> 00:10:38.480
 Go ahead and search for that claim.

00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:42.640
 Oh, you guys are not googling hard enough.

00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:44.360
 Should we move on to our next act?

00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:46.360
 OK, time for fact number two.

00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:48.600
 And that is Andrew Hunter Murray.

00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:50.760
 My fact is that Napoleon loved Rose

00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:52.720
 chicken so much that his household chefs

00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:57.600
 were constantly cooking some in case he decided he wanted any,

00:10:57.600 --> 00:11:00.400
 which is my personal aim for my life.

00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:02.080
 I think that's when you know you've made it.

00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:04.760
 But so is this-- I mean, is there a lot of--

00:11:04.760 --> 00:11:07.760
 is chicken sort of really, if you read an Napoleon biography,

00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:08.600
 is it just everywhere?

00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:10.240
 Is it just constant mentions of chicken?

00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:10.760
 Or--

00:11:10.760 --> 00:11:15.320
 Barely a page goes by in the 700 page Napoleon biography.

00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:17.080
 He was more chicken than man by the end.

00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:23.240
 No, I don't know, it's just something that was an article

00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:24.520
 about it recently, which I spotted.

00:11:24.520 --> 00:11:27.800
 This was at his palace in Paris, the twelery.

00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:30.280
 And just chicken was constantly being cooked on a spit

00:11:30.280 --> 00:11:32.000
 because he was very erratic in the way he ate.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.480
 He would have meals at odd times of day.

00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:38.680
 And he wasn't breakfast lunch and dinner sort of man.

00:11:38.680 --> 00:11:41.440
 Once when he went on a journey from Cairo to--

00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:42.120
 oh, where was it?

00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:43.160
 I think Suez.

00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:45.400
 He just took three roast chickens wrapped in paper

00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:46.760
 as his provisions with him.

00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:48.040
 So yeah, he loved it.

00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:51.080
 Found it quite a cool Mussolini had a code word

00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:54.160
 that he used to tell his wife whenever he was doing something

00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:55.200
 at the table.

00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:58.160
 And he didn't want his mother-in-law to know what he was doing.

00:11:58.160 --> 00:12:00.040
 What was he doing at the table?

00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:02.920
 Is it the same as what these people were doing at my awards?

00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:05.160
 [LAUGHTER]

00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:07.640
 Sorry, I should clarify, it's once he left the table

00:12:07.640 --> 00:12:09.120
 that he started doing the thing.

00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:11.160
 So he loved joling with swords.

00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:13.440
 He was really obsessed with joling with swords.

00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:16.480
 And so he got into fights all the time with people.

00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:18.000
 Over just minor little things.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.720
 And he would say at the breakfast table, to his wife,

00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:25.680
 this was the line, today we are making spaghetti.

00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:28.160
 And that was code to say, today I'm going outside

00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:30.320
 to fight another man with swords.

00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:31.000
 And I--

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:31.500
 Yeah.

00:12:31.500 --> 00:12:33.880
 What happened if he actually was eating spaghetti one day?

00:12:33.880 --> 00:12:35.800
 And then some guy just came at him with a sword

00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:37.080
 because he thought it was a code.

00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:38.160
 Yeah, and it's a confusing code.

00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:38.680
 I agree.

00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:40.960
 And also, I bet, at the same time, the mother-in-law,

00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:42.600
 because she was living with them, would probably be going,

00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:44.280
 ooh, spaghetti tonight then.

00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:46.560
 And no matter what was the plans for dinner,

00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:49.320
 would suddenly be changed, because Mussolini wanted a fight.

00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:51.000
 You've just got a cooked man's hand here.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.360
 What happened today with this spaghetti?

00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:55.360
 How many secrets did he keep from his mother?

00:12:55.360 --> 00:12:57.600
 Did he have a code for I'm going to enslave a nation

00:12:57.600 --> 00:12:59.840
 and then go to war with various other nations?

00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:01.040
 Was that--

00:13:01.040 --> 00:13:04.040
 No, I'm going to feed the cat.

00:13:04.040 --> 00:13:06.520
 Yeah, just as a side note to this fact,

00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:09.280
 I found a website all about rabbits during the course

00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:11.360
 of my research called Napoleon Bunny Part.

00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:16.120
 Just so you knew.

00:13:16.120 --> 00:13:18.880
 Was Napoleon once not attacked by rabbits?

00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:20.000
 There is this story, yeah.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.200
 And it's hard to know what's propaganda.

00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:25.200
 It's been explained as his biggest ever defeat

00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:27.680
 that he was attacked by bunnies on a battlefield

00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:28.920
 and had to run away or something like that.

00:13:28.920 --> 00:13:31.920
 Yeah, I thought it was when he was visiting Egypt, possibly.

00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:34.960
 But yeah, he was mobbed by rabbits when he was out hunting

00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:35.760
 while shooting.

00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:37.840
 And people always think he's afraid of cats, don't they?

00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:39.040
 Which I don't think is true.

00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:40.680
 But I think they're confusing him with Napoleon

00:13:40.680 --> 00:13:44.760
 and the third is nephew, who used to have to jump onto a table

00:13:44.760 --> 00:13:47.840
 if a cat entered the room or like climb up the curtains

00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:48.840
 to avoid it.

00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:51.240
 That's one thing cats can do if they were cats.

00:13:51.240 --> 00:13:53.240
 Yeah.

00:13:53.240 --> 00:13:53.760
 That's weird.

00:13:53.760 --> 00:13:54.560
 Not a smart man.

00:13:54.560 --> 00:13:55.760
 That's why he doesn't have the--

00:13:55.760 --> 00:13:57.840
 Yeah, the cute also to his uncle does.

00:13:57.840 --> 00:14:00.400
 Josephine's dog really hated Napoleon.

00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:00.920
 Yeah.

00:14:00.920 --> 00:14:02.600
 And apparently during the wedding night,

00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:05.600
 it bit him on the leg while he was asleep, not during the--

00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:06.080
 OK.

00:14:06.080 --> 00:14:07.880
 So they had a problem with animals, didn't they?

00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:09.560
 I wonder if his actual--

00:14:09.560 --> 00:14:11.560
 the rest of his life has actually distracted us

00:14:11.560 --> 00:14:13.560
 from the fact that he was the one human on Earth who

00:14:13.560 --> 00:14:15.680
 animals all hated unanimously.

00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:18.600
 And we've been blinded to that actual real extraordinary fact

00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:19.760
 about a man.

00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:21.320
 There was another Napoleon.

00:14:21.320 --> 00:14:24.280
 I think one of the very last members of Napoleon family

00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:26.000
 are Jerome Bonaparte.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:27.000
 Jerome Bonaparte?

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:28.800
 Jerome Bonaparte.

00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:30.560
 They moved to New York.

00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:31.760
 Or the fact no, they did.

00:14:31.760 --> 00:14:34.720
 Guys, let's stop it.

00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:38.240
 They escaped after the fall of Napoleon,

00:14:38.240 --> 00:14:40.920
 lots of his family members with lots and lots of money.

00:14:40.920 --> 00:14:42.240
 And one of them died.

00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:43.920
 Jerome Bonaparte, I think it was, died

00:14:43.920 --> 00:14:46.520
 after tripping over two entangled dog leads

00:14:46.520 --> 00:14:47.560
 while out on a walk.

00:14:47.560 --> 00:14:48.400
 Oh, my God.

00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:49.040
 Oh.

00:14:49.040 --> 00:14:50.040
 Yeah.

00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:52.040
 Ooh.

00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:54.840
 Well, also, he had problems with horse ride.

00:14:54.840 --> 00:14:55.880
 I'm loving this theory.

00:14:55.880 --> 00:14:57.280
 I really think you might be right.

00:14:57.280 --> 00:15:01.720
 So some historians speculate that the reason that he lost water

00:15:01.720 --> 00:15:05.000
 glue is because he had incredibly bad hemorrhoids, which

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.080
 was a serious problem for him that repeated throughout his life,

00:15:07.080 --> 00:15:09.560
 and that he couldn't sit on his horse throughout that day,

00:15:09.560 --> 00:15:10.080
 which is due.

00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:12.520
 So I think we don't have any evidence that he rode his horse.

00:15:12.520 --> 00:15:15.200
 And so he couldn't survey the battlefield properly.

00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:17.280
 And he couldn't ride his horses into battle.

00:15:17.280 --> 00:15:19.200
 He had to stay backstage because he couldn't sit

00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:19.720
 in a saddle.

00:15:19.720 --> 00:15:20.600
 It was too painful.

00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:21.440
 And there we go.

00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:22.600
 That was the end of everything.

00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:24.240
 So you just thought he were high enough?

00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:25.480
 I mean, he wasn't that short.

00:15:25.480 --> 00:15:27.760
 This is a myth that he was short, wasn't it?

00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:29.800
 Yeah, he was kind of short.

00:15:29.800 --> 00:15:33.520
 He was, I think he was an inch taller than Sarkozy.

00:15:33.520 --> 00:15:34.040
 OK.

00:15:34.040 --> 00:15:35.920
 But at the time, he was taller than the average Frenchman.

00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:36.440
 Yes.

00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:38.320
 He was taller than Nelson, I'm sorry to say.

00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:41.840
 But it is weird how often I was reading a thing of first-hand

00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:42.880
 sources about Napoleon.

00:15:42.880 --> 00:15:44.560
 And it's weird how often people point out

00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:46.280
 his small stature, given that we say

00:15:46.280 --> 00:15:47.560
 that he was above average height.

00:15:47.560 --> 00:15:50.360
 Maybe he just seems-- you know when you see someone who seems

00:15:50.360 --> 00:15:52.040
 like their small, but actually they're six foot.

00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:56.040
 Maybe he's just at a very small demeanor.

00:15:56.040 --> 00:15:56.560
 I don't know.

00:15:56.560 --> 00:15:59.040
 Why were people always going on about it?

00:15:59.040 --> 00:16:01.880
 Can I tell you someone else who likes chicken?

00:16:01.880 --> 00:16:02.400
 Yeah.

00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:03.800
 Yeah.

00:16:03.800 --> 00:16:07.680
 Is it-- is it-- I, James, like chicken.

00:16:07.680 --> 00:16:10.360
 No, it's Stacy Irving from Birmingham, of course.

00:16:10.360 --> 00:16:11.720
 She eats chicken nuggets.

00:16:11.720 --> 00:16:12.920
 It's the only thing she eats.

00:16:12.920 --> 00:16:14.680
 Chicken nuggets all the time.

00:16:14.680 --> 00:16:18.240
 She has 20 a day that she shares with her boyfriend.

00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:21.720
 And doxas have one that is very, very, very bad for her health,

00:16:21.720 --> 00:16:22.960
 just eating chicken nuggets.

00:16:22.960 --> 00:16:28.200
 I mean, if she shares them, she's not having 20 a day, then that's like--

00:16:28.200 --> 00:16:30.760
 I mean, she is kind of like, it is really bad for her health.

00:16:30.760 --> 00:16:32.240
 But the newspaper article said,

00:16:32.240 --> 00:16:34.480
 a less serious consequence of her craving

00:16:34.480 --> 00:16:37.240
 is that she's struggling to start all of the free toys

00:16:37.240 --> 00:16:40.440
 that come with a fast food meal.

00:16:40.440 --> 00:16:42.480
 So she might be dying, but yeah, where

00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:44.600
 is she going to keep those toys?

00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:45.080
 What is it?

00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:47.640
 The world's largest chicken nugget is twice

00:16:47.640 --> 00:16:49.640
 the size of the world's largest chicken nugget?

00:16:49.640 --> 00:16:50.960
 I think it is.

00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:52.000
 Whoa, really?

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:53.000
 Yeah.

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.120
 Imagine finding that in the box.

00:16:55.120 --> 00:17:00.960
 Someone else, actually, you'll probably

00:17:00.960 --> 00:17:03.840
 know this Gary Watkinson from Huddersfield.

00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:04.840
 Of course he is.

00:17:04.840 --> 00:17:07.320
 He only eats beans on toast.

00:17:07.320 --> 00:17:09.480
 That's the only thing he ever, ever eats.

00:17:09.480 --> 00:17:11.920
 And it's from ever, since he can remember.

00:17:11.920 --> 00:17:13.760
 But he actually said, the beans on toast thing

00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:15.240
 is only more recent.

00:17:15.240 --> 00:17:17.600
 Before that, it was just beans and toast separately.

00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:26.400
 And then, like a second Einstein, one day,

00:17:26.400 --> 00:17:27.840
 a moment of inspiration.

00:17:27.840 --> 00:17:32.840
 [LAUGHTER]

00:17:32.840 --> 00:17:35.760
 Yeah, Evonne Wake from the Nutrition Society said,

00:17:35.760 --> 00:17:38.040
 Gary is probably not constipated.

00:17:38.040 --> 00:17:39.520
 [LAUGHTER]

00:17:39.520 --> 00:17:46.920
 I read it.

00:17:46.920 --> 00:17:50.280
 So just on the subject of leaders and food.

00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:53.720
 So a lot of leaders get given international gifts all the time.

00:17:53.720 --> 00:17:55.680
 I'm thinking, in particular, of the American presidents.

00:17:55.680 --> 00:17:59.800
 Two pandas were given to Nixon, that kind of thing.

00:17:59.800 --> 00:18:03.880
 I discovered that LBJ, Lyndon B. Johnson,

00:18:03.880 --> 00:18:09.800
 was given by an unnamed source, a Chinese chef called Mr. Wong,

00:18:09.800 --> 00:18:12.120
 who just rocked up to the White House door.

00:18:12.120 --> 00:18:14.040
 And he used to-- there's all these reports.

00:18:14.040 --> 00:18:15.680
 No one really knew what he was doing there.

00:18:15.680 --> 00:18:18.680
 Mr. Wong just lived with them during his term.

00:18:18.680 --> 00:18:20.520
 They were trying to go to the holiday retreat that they

00:18:20.520 --> 00:18:22.400
 go to, and they couldn't find Mr. Wong,

00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:23.840
 because they were bringing him, because he decided

00:18:23.840 --> 00:18:25.960
 to play hide-and-seek with the president.

00:18:25.960 --> 00:18:29.400
 And they eventually found him behind some curtains

00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:31.480
 after a good long search.

00:18:31.480 --> 00:18:35.080
 But he was hiding from a cat to be there.

00:18:35.080 --> 00:18:37.120
 That's a-- presidents aren't allowed to accept gifts

00:18:37.120 --> 00:18:38.840
 that are worth more than something like $5.

00:18:38.840 --> 00:18:41.920
 So he must have been an extremely cheap man.

00:18:41.920 --> 00:18:43.160
 I don't know.

00:18:43.160 --> 00:18:46.720
 Did you know that fittingly, someone bought--

00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:49.160
 so Napoleon has two of those hats that survived

00:18:49.160 --> 00:18:50.920
 in Napoleonic hats, and one of them

00:18:50.920 --> 00:18:53.520
 was bought for 1.5 million pounds last year.

00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:56.600
 And it was bought by a chicken mogul.

00:18:56.600 --> 00:18:59.840
 It was bought by this Korean guy who

00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:02.280
 owns a chain of chicken, fried chicken restaurants,

00:19:02.280 --> 00:19:04.360
 the Ha Rim group, which I think provides

00:19:04.360 --> 00:19:06.440
 fried chicken to the people of Korea.

00:19:06.440 --> 00:19:09.640
 So on things of Napoleon's being sold,

00:19:09.640 --> 00:19:15.400
 in 2006, one of Napoleon's teeth was sold for 11,000 pounds.

00:19:15.400 --> 00:19:17.680
 In June, this year, a couple of months ago,

00:19:17.680 --> 00:19:20.080
 a single one of Napoleon's hairs was sold at auction

00:19:20.080 --> 00:19:21.480
 for 130 pounds.

00:19:21.480 --> 00:19:23.800
 And I think we've said before on this podcast that,

00:19:23.800 --> 00:19:27.000
 after he died, Napoleon's penis was removed and mummified,

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:28.200
 and has passed through several hands,

00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:29.640
 and has been auctioned several times.

00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:31.320
 But I have a theory that someone out there

00:19:31.320 --> 00:19:33.040
 is reassembling Napoleon.

00:19:33.040 --> 00:19:37.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:40.160
 I think the hair thing is a small victory for Napoleon

00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:41.120
 against Wellington.

00:19:41.120 --> 00:19:43.320
 Because-- so later on, the hairs obviously

00:19:43.320 --> 00:19:45.000
 depreciated in value, because in the '90s,

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:49.480
 a lock of Napoleon's hair sold for 3,680 pounds at auction.

00:19:49.480 --> 00:19:53.160
 And I think the same year, Wellington's hair only got 598.

00:19:53.160 --> 00:19:55.440
 So that's quite a nice-- it's like balances out

00:19:55.440 --> 00:19:58.360
 the record between those guys.

00:19:58.360 --> 00:20:00.560
 A penguin named Napoleon Boulder Parts

00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:02.640
 has fallen in love with a Wellington boot.

00:20:02.640 --> 00:20:06.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:09.840
 Can you imagine if we don't know really what reincarnation is,

00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:12.480
 but everything is conscious, and that's

00:20:12.480 --> 00:20:15.080
 they're actually just having a-- sorry about that past life.

00:20:15.080 --> 00:20:17.120
 I hope you're well.

00:20:17.120 --> 00:20:18.320
 They never met, did they?

00:20:18.320 --> 00:20:18.840
 Did they not?

00:20:18.840 --> 00:20:19.680
 Never met.

00:20:19.680 --> 00:20:23.840
 But so once the English had defeated the French,

00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:26.040
 Wellington had an idea that he presented the British government

00:20:26.040 --> 00:20:29.400
 that was disgust that rather than sent him into exile,

00:20:29.400 --> 00:20:32.240
 they built him a house, really near Wellington's house,

00:20:32.240 --> 00:20:34.160
 somewhere on the British coastline.

00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:35.560
 And they lived near each other.

00:20:35.560 --> 00:20:37.240
 And they just hang out on an exchange

00:20:37.240 --> 00:20:40.280
 like strategic tips and anecdotes.

00:20:40.280 --> 00:20:42.120
 I mean, what a great idea.

00:20:42.120 --> 00:20:43.800
 Who can I boss that plan?

00:20:43.800 --> 00:20:45.320
 Because that sounds fantastic.

00:20:45.320 --> 00:20:47.640
 We've said on the show that Wellington was obsessed with Napoleon.

00:20:47.640 --> 00:20:49.880
 He bought all of Napoleon's stuff after Waterloo.

00:20:49.880 --> 00:20:52.160
 And he hired Napoleon's ex-cook.

00:20:52.160 --> 00:20:54.840
 The mysterious and everlasting, Mr. Wong.

00:20:54.840 --> 00:20:59.200
 [LAUGHTER]

00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:01.720
 I'm going to have to move us on in a second.

00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:03.160
 Has anyone got anything else?

00:21:03.160 --> 00:21:04.080
 I've got one last thing.

00:21:04.080 --> 00:21:06.520
 This is-- it's not particularly interesting or anything,

00:21:06.520 --> 00:21:09.520
 but it's just a hard sell down, please.

00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:10.840
 But sometimes you read a sentence.

00:21:10.840 --> 00:21:13.480
 You think that's the best sentence I've read today.

00:21:13.480 --> 00:21:14.280
 So it's just this.

00:21:14.280 --> 00:21:17.320
 Stalin loved bananas and would be furious if you served him

00:21:17.320 --> 00:21:18.520
 a substandard banana.

00:21:18.520 --> 00:21:21.360
 [LAUGHTER]

00:21:21.360 --> 00:21:23.680
 OK, it's time for fact number three.

00:21:23.680 --> 00:21:24.960
 And that is my fact.

00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:28.880
 My fact this week is that IMDB was originally just

00:21:28.880 --> 00:21:33.200
 a list of actresses with beautiful eyes.

00:21:33.200 --> 00:21:37.520
 It just started as this little list that the guy created.

00:21:37.520 --> 00:21:39.280
 And he just thought, I need to put together

00:21:39.280 --> 00:21:41.200
 a list of all the actresses that I think

00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:43.440
 people need to know have beautiful eyes.

00:21:43.440 --> 00:21:45.560
 And then people started going to and adding other lists.

00:21:45.560 --> 00:21:47.000
 And then IMDB grew out of it.

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:49.000
 And it was called "Those Eyes" to begin with.

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:50.440
 That's the original name.

00:21:50.440 --> 00:21:50.960
 Wow.

00:21:50.960 --> 00:21:53.360
 The way it brought his Colneedman brought together two things

00:21:53.360 --> 00:21:54.880
 to turn them into IMDB.

00:21:54.880 --> 00:21:57.520
 And people often say, IMDB grew out of this list of women

00:21:57.520 --> 00:21:58.640
 with beautiful eyes.

00:21:58.640 --> 00:22:00.680
 And what he brought together was, one of those things

00:22:00.680 --> 00:22:03.000
 was the list of actresses with beautiful eyes.

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:05.640
 And then the other thing he brought in, just a little addon,

00:22:05.640 --> 00:22:07.680
 was a list that someone else had created, which

00:22:07.680 --> 00:22:10.520
 was a movie ratings report, where participants were asked

00:22:10.520 --> 00:22:12.560
 to rate movies on a 1 to 10 scale.

00:22:12.560 --> 00:22:15.680
 But it was mainly based IMDB on the actresses

00:22:15.680 --> 00:22:16.560
 with beautiful eyes.

00:22:16.560 --> 00:22:18.400
 I mean, it sounds like the actresses with beautiful eyes

00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:20.800
 was kind of a random, irrelevant list

00:22:20.800 --> 00:22:22.360
 that just happened outside it.

00:22:22.360 --> 00:22:23.680
 He sort of put them all together.

00:22:23.680 --> 00:22:25.960
 He recalls the details of every film that he sees.

00:22:25.960 --> 00:22:28.440
 And he has done since he was 13 years old Colneedman.

00:22:28.440 --> 00:22:30.800
 And he has seen-- this was 18 months ago.

00:22:30.800 --> 00:22:31.800
 So he's seen more since then.

00:22:31.800 --> 00:22:35.640
 But at that count, it was 8,505.

00:22:35.640 --> 00:22:39.080
 That's one film for every 48 hours since he was born.

00:22:39.080 --> 00:22:40.800
 Wow.

00:22:40.800 --> 00:22:42.320
 His favorite film is "Vertigo."

00:22:42.320 --> 00:22:43.120
 Really?

00:22:43.120 --> 00:22:45.680
 And that's why it always tops the charts.

00:22:45.680 --> 00:22:46.520
 Yes.

00:22:46.520 --> 00:22:48.000
 He's rigging it, isn't he?

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:49.320
 Because it's a good film.

00:22:49.320 --> 00:22:53.040
 But I read an article that said that he and his--

00:22:53.040 --> 00:22:54.160
 it was a quote by him.

00:22:54.160 --> 00:22:57.040
 He said that he and his wife love going to the cinema.

00:22:57.040 --> 00:23:00.600
 And they watch a film together every Tuesday lunchtime.

00:23:00.600 --> 00:23:02.480
 But what it sounds like is they do do that.

00:23:02.480 --> 00:23:04.440
 But the rest of the time, it's just him watching loads

00:23:04.440 --> 00:23:05.440
 of other movies.

00:23:05.440 --> 00:23:07.760
 So it's more like, my wife has begrudgingly agreed

00:23:07.760 --> 00:23:09.880
 to come to the cinema with me once a week.

00:23:09.880 --> 00:23:11.680
 Otherwise, we would never see each other.

00:23:11.680 --> 00:23:13.520
 [LAUGHTER]

00:23:13.520 --> 00:23:15.800
 And when he was a boy, he rented out the film Alien.

00:23:15.800 --> 00:23:17.920
 And he watched it every single day for a fortnight.

00:23:17.920 --> 00:23:18.400
 Wow.

00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:19.440
 That's a waste of his time.

00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:21.520
 He needs to be getting through these films.

00:23:21.520 --> 00:23:22.320
 Yeah.

00:23:22.320 --> 00:23:24.320
 Well, he said that recently there are so many more good films

00:23:24.320 --> 00:23:25.640
 being made these days.

00:23:25.640 --> 00:23:27.640
 It was just that at the time that was one of the best films

00:23:27.640 --> 00:23:28.160
 ever made.

00:23:28.160 --> 00:23:29.480
 And it was so huge.

00:23:29.480 --> 00:23:31.320
 It is a fantastic place.

00:23:31.320 --> 00:23:33.640
 I actually do a fair bit of QI research

00:23:33.640 --> 00:23:35.000
 by looking at the IMDB.

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:36.240
 Did you know section?

00:23:36.240 --> 00:23:39.560
 I love reading the user reviews, because the honesty of it

00:23:39.560 --> 00:23:41.200
 is just, here's my favorite one.

00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:44.640
 I haven't even read further than the title of this review.

00:23:44.640 --> 00:23:47.040
 But it was for the movie Batman and Robin.

00:23:47.040 --> 00:23:49.840
 And the headline was, I lost faith in humanity.

00:23:49.840 --> 00:23:53.680
 [LAUGHTER]

00:23:53.680 --> 00:23:54.680
 Sign the Joker.

00:23:54.680 --> 00:23:56.840
 [LAUGHTER]

00:23:56.840 --> 00:24:00.520
 Do you know what is the bottom ranked movie on all of IMDB?

00:24:00.520 --> 00:24:01.360
 No.

00:24:01.360 --> 00:24:04.680
 It's called Jurassic Shark.

00:24:04.680 --> 00:24:06.040
 It's from 2012.

00:24:06.040 --> 00:24:08.680
 It's got a rating of 1.5%.

00:24:08.680 --> 00:24:09.760
 And here's what it is.

00:24:09.760 --> 00:24:12.400
 It's, when an oil company on Wittingly Unleashes,

00:24:12.400 --> 00:24:15.760
 a prehistoric shark from its icy prison,

00:24:15.760 --> 00:24:18.680
 the Jurassic Killan maroons a group of thieves

00:24:18.680 --> 00:24:21.640
 and a beautiful young female college student

00:24:21.640 --> 00:24:24.520
 on an abandoned piece of land.

00:24:24.520 --> 00:24:26.520
 How did they manage to screw that up, though?

00:24:26.520 --> 00:24:28.480
 Because that sounds like such a winning.

00:24:28.480 --> 00:24:29.160
 This film.

00:24:29.160 --> 00:24:32.440
 I'll give you some others in the bottom, like 20 or something.

00:24:32.440 --> 00:24:35.320
 The Hottie and the Nottie from 2008.

00:24:35.320 --> 00:24:37.280
 Oh, it's a Paris Hilton movie.

00:24:37.280 --> 00:24:39.000
 Oh, is it?

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:39.600
 Apparently.

00:24:39.600 --> 00:24:42.960
 Apparently.

00:24:42.960 --> 00:24:45.640
 I think we found that why it's not at the absolute bottom.

00:24:45.640 --> 00:24:47.880
 [LAUGHTER]

00:24:47.880 --> 00:24:50.840
 Do you know the-- so there's one film on IMDB which

00:24:50.840 --> 00:24:54.360
 isn't marked out of 10, which is Spinal Tap,

00:24:54.360 --> 00:24:57.720
 and the IMDB page marks that it's rating as marked out of 11.

00:24:57.720 --> 00:24:59.400
 So it gives 8 out of 11.

00:24:59.400 --> 00:25:00.200
 Which, and then--

00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:02.120
 Oh, which actually really affects how good a movie it is

00:25:02.120 --> 00:25:03.280
 in the overall rating because--

00:25:03.280 --> 00:25:04.600
 Yeah, so it's really annoying because I worry

00:25:04.600 --> 00:25:06.200
 that people have a notice, and they're giving it an 8,

00:25:06.200 --> 00:25:07.960
 thinking that's out of 10, and that's 80%.

00:25:07.960 --> 00:25:08.520
 But it's not.

00:25:08.520 --> 00:25:10.760
 It's obviously X% that I'm not going to patronize you

00:25:10.760 --> 00:25:12.960
 by working out here myself right now.

00:25:12.960 --> 00:25:16.680
 [LAUGHTER]

00:25:16.680 --> 00:25:18.240
 Yeah, it's a lower percent.

00:25:18.240 --> 00:25:18.760
 Yeah.

00:25:18.760 --> 00:25:20.560
 It should be higher than 8 out of 11.

00:25:20.560 --> 00:25:24.960
 I read them at cracked.com article about the most depressing

00:25:24.960 --> 00:25:26.800
 IMDB pages.

00:25:26.800 --> 00:25:29.720
 Their top one was someone called Leslie Bremer,

00:25:29.720 --> 00:25:32.800
 and she's only had nine roles in her whole career.

00:25:32.800 --> 00:25:37.280
 They include Girl in Bikini, Shower Girl, Party Girl,

00:25:37.280 --> 00:25:40.760
 and Girl Leaving Room.

00:25:40.760 --> 00:25:43.880
 She's only had one named party in her entire career,

00:25:43.880 --> 00:25:48.080
 and she played Sandy in a movie called School Spirit.

00:25:48.080 --> 00:25:50.760
 But on IMDB, it says, in several scenes,

00:25:50.760 --> 00:25:54.280
 actress Leslie can be seen wearing a necklace with the letter L

00:25:54.280 --> 00:25:57.680
 on it, despite the fact that her character's name is Sandy.

00:25:57.680 --> 00:26:01.040
 [LAUGHTER]

00:26:01.040 --> 00:26:02.560
 I'm going to have to move us on in a sec.

00:26:02.560 --> 00:26:04.160
 We're going to power through to the last one.

00:26:04.160 --> 00:26:05.320
 Anyone got anything else?

00:26:05.320 --> 00:26:08.200
 I looked up IMDB's current poll of actresses

00:26:08.200 --> 00:26:10.360
 with beautiful eyes, and it's just a list.

00:26:10.360 --> 00:26:11.280
 It's really weird.

00:26:11.280 --> 00:26:13.640
 So there are lots of people who submitted their own lists,

00:26:13.640 --> 00:26:15.280
 but their own curator ones.

00:26:15.280 --> 00:26:17.960
 But this one's a poll which takes others users into account.

00:26:17.960 --> 00:26:21.360
 So the top 20 is all people like Cameron Diaz, Rachel Fies,

00:26:21.360 --> 00:26:23.640
 Natalie Portman, other people like that.

00:26:23.640 --> 00:26:25.800
 And then Joan Plarrite is in there, who--

00:26:25.800 --> 00:26:27.160
 I don't know if you know who that is, but I mean,

00:26:27.160 --> 00:26:28.280
 she's 85 years old.

00:26:28.280 --> 00:26:30.760
 She is a kind of famous stage actress.

00:26:30.760 --> 00:26:33.280
 She's often in things like Inspector Morse playing

00:26:33.280 --> 00:26:35.480
 a servant woman.

00:26:35.480 --> 00:26:37.000
 But does she have a really nice eyes?

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:38.840
 I looked really hard, and to be honest,

00:26:38.840 --> 00:26:42.120
 I found it hard to see what they're talking about.

00:26:42.120 --> 00:26:43.680
 Everyone's got nice eyes.

00:26:43.680 --> 00:26:45.320
 I mean, just eyes are nice, aren't they?

00:26:45.320 --> 00:26:46.320
 Yeah.

00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:47.320
 How long?

00:26:47.320 --> 00:26:48.320
 OK.

00:26:48.320 --> 00:26:50.400
 You know, you can say someone's got nice hair

00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:54.280
 or not very nice hair, but eyes are just nice to look at.

00:26:54.280 --> 00:26:56.840
 Everyone likes looking at a knife.

00:26:56.840 --> 00:26:58.520
 I've seen some bad eyes.

00:26:58.520 --> 00:26:59.360
 Have you?

00:26:59.360 --> 00:27:01.120
 There were some really bad eyes.

00:27:01.120 --> 00:27:03.080
 I have a couple of facts about eyes if you want them.

00:27:03.080 --> 00:27:04.840
 Yeah, fact number one, eyes are lovely.

00:27:04.840 --> 00:27:13.520
 Fact number two, the first person known to have had blue eyes

00:27:13.520 --> 00:27:14.960
 was we know who it was.

00:27:14.960 --> 00:27:16.520
 So it was 7,000 years ago.

00:27:16.520 --> 00:27:19.640
 It was a caveman living in Spain, because it's a mutation.

00:27:19.640 --> 00:27:22.200
 So everyone who's got blue eyes can trace the ancestry back

00:27:22.200 --> 00:27:24.200
 to that particular individual.

00:27:24.200 --> 00:27:26.280
 I wonder if everyone just went to that cave

00:27:26.280 --> 00:27:30.080
 and then went, you have beautiful eyes.

00:27:30.080 --> 00:27:33.880
 And then Andy went, everyone has a beautiful eyes.

00:27:33.880 --> 00:27:36.320
 OK, it's time for our final fact of the show.

00:27:36.320 --> 00:27:38.600
 And that is Chosinski.

00:27:38.600 --> 00:27:43.200
 Yes, my fact is that the word fascinate literally

00:27:43.200 --> 00:27:47.400
 means the embodiment of the divine fallace.

00:27:47.400 --> 00:27:49.680
 Certainly the sense in which I use it all the time.

00:27:49.680 --> 00:27:54.480
 So this is the etymology of fascinate.

00:27:54.480 --> 00:27:56.760
 It comes from the Latin word fascinum, which

00:27:56.760 --> 00:28:00.880
 was either fascinus the phallic god, which we know very little

00:28:00.880 --> 00:28:05.280
 about, or it was a phallic object that you carry around

00:28:05.280 --> 00:28:07.680
 for good luck, which they did a lot of the time.

00:28:07.680 --> 00:28:09.920
 I just like to ward off the evil eye or something like that.

00:28:09.920 --> 00:28:10.440
 Yeah, exactly.

00:28:10.440 --> 00:28:13.440
 So the verb fascinari in Latin was

00:28:13.440 --> 00:28:17.440
 to use the power of the phallus to either ward off the evil eye

00:28:17.440 --> 00:28:19.760
 or to hypnotize someone in an evil manner.

00:28:19.760 --> 00:28:21.960
 So if you're fascinating somebody,

00:28:21.960 --> 00:28:24.280
 you are using the power of the phallus.

00:28:24.280 --> 00:28:26.720
 And what would a cast a spell on them?

00:28:26.720 --> 00:28:28.520
 This is what Dan was doing at that award ceremony.

00:28:28.520 --> 00:28:30.080
 Yeah.

00:28:30.080 --> 00:28:32.560
 So I spent most of today googling penises

00:28:32.560 --> 00:28:33.560
 of fascinating.

00:28:33.560 --> 00:28:38.080
 And it's a lot out there.

00:28:38.080 --> 00:28:39.480
 All penises are beautiful.

00:28:39.480 --> 00:28:48.080
 Well, back in back May last year, James

00:28:48.080 --> 00:28:52.120
 and I were in the office alone together.

00:28:52.120 --> 00:28:54.200
 And we kind of ran out of conversation.

00:28:54.200 --> 00:28:57.120
 And this is kind of--

00:28:57.120 --> 00:29:00.040
 This is really not the time, not the place for this.

00:29:00.040 --> 00:29:02.200
 People need to know.

00:29:02.200 --> 00:29:04.000
 So we kind of just ran out of conversation.

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:07.680
 And James, just in a way to sort of just spark up conversation,

00:29:07.680 --> 00:29:09.880
 just looked up to me and said, hey, do you know that there

00:29:09.880 --> 00:29:13.440
 was over 600 guys in the world with two dicks?

00:29:13.440 --> 00:29:15.160
 And as if that was like, oh, good, we're back in.

00:29:15.160 --> 00:29:17.160
 We have a conversation going on.

00:29:17.160 --> 00:29:18.040
 And I googled it.

00:29:18.040 --> 00:29:22.080
 And there were 600 men in the world who have two penises.

00:29:22.080 --> 00:29:24.680
 And on Reddit, there's a website Reddit.

00:29:24.680 --> 00:29:26.640
 They have that thing, AMA.

00:29:26.640 --> 00:29:28.080
 And AMA asked me anything.

00:29:28.080 --> 00:29:29.560
 One of the most successful things I ever had

00:29:29.560 --> 00:29:32.560
 was someone coming on saying, I have two penises.

00:29:32.560 --> 00:29:33.480
 Ask me anything.

00:29:33.480 --> 00:29:35.880
 It was what bit where it an interview was talking about.

00:29:35.880 --> 00:29:38.000
 It says, the most upsetting moment for him

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:39.920
 was a girl he dated.

00:29:39.920 --> 00:29:43.120
 Seriously, he got-- he was over one night stands.

00:29:43.120 --> 00:29:44.240
 And they dated for three months.

00:29:44.240 --> 00:29:45.600
 They were just kissing and cuddling.

00:29:45.600 --> 00:29:47.440
 She finally was ready.

00:29:47.440 --> 00:29:49.880
 I'd put it off for another month after that.

00:29:49.880 --> 00:29:51.720
 But when it came down to it, I told her

00:29:51.720 --> 00:29:54.280
 that I was built different from other guys.

00:29:54.280 --> 00:29:56.520
 So I was sort of slightly built different.

00:29:56.520 --> 00:29:58.000
 She said she didn't care.

00:29:58.000 --> 00:29:59.280
 I revealed them to her.

00:29:59.280 --> 00:30:01.040
 And she said she definitely cared.

00:30:01.040 --> 00:30:04.880
 [LAUGHTER]

00:30:04.880 --> 00:30:08.920
 Only she had known that all penises are beautiful.

00:30:08.920 --> 00:30:11.440
 There was a guy that used to freak shows

00:30:11.440 --> 00:30:12.560
 in the 19th century.

00:30:12.560 --> 00:30:14.080
 And there was one guy called--

00:30:14.080 --> 00:30:17.360
 I think he's called like Dos Santos or something like that.

00:30:17.360 --> 00:30:20.680
 And he was known as the man with two swords.

00:30:20.680 --> 00:30:23.520
 And he used to show himself off as a man with two penises.

00:30:23.520 --> 00:30:27.400
 And he married a woman called Blanche Duma

00:30:27.400 --> 00:30:28.400
 or something like that.

00:30:28.400 --> 00:30:29.840
 She called two scabbards or something.

00:30:29.840 --> 00:30:37.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:39.720
 No, she-- but she did have two vaginas, yeah.

00:30:39.720 --> 00:30:41.600
 What?

00:30:41.600 --> 00:30:44.760
 There's someone out there for everybody.

00:30:44.760 --> 00:30:47.360
 OK, this was a fact about etymology.

00:30:47.360 --> 00:30:48.360
 Oh, yeah.

00:30:48.360 --> 00:30:49.320
 Sorry, sorry.

00:30:49.320 --> 00:30:51.440
 Yeah, back to Roman penises, at least,

00:30:51.440 --> 00:30:53.280
 because that's more highbrow, I think.

00:30:53.280 --> 00:30:55.480
 They were more highbrow then.

00:30:55.480 --> 00:30:59.520
 So the age of nine days, Roman boys

00:30:59.520 --> 00:31:02.960
 would be given an amulet with a phallus inside it.

00:31:02.960 --> 00:31:05.400
 And that was to ward off the evil eye.

00:31:05.400 --> 00:31:06.160
 That was the point of it.

00:31:06.160 --> 00:31:07.680
 And they'd have to go around wearing this amulet

00:31:07.680 --> 00:31:10.440
 with a phallus inside it until they came of age.

00:31:10.440 --> 00:31:12.200
 Because they weren't really-- they weren't as obscene

00:31:12.200 --> 00:31:13.800
 as they are now, although they weren't seen as being obscene,

00:31:13.800 --> 00:31:15.360
 because of this old good luck thing.

00:31:15.360 --> 00:31:17.160
 Yeah, and also getting rid of this evil eye,

00:31:17.160 --> 00:31:20.400
 it was really thought to be a really serious thing.

00:31:20.400 --> 00:31:23.720
 There's a Roman mosaic of a phallus ejaculating

00:31:23.720 --> 00:31:26.560
 into a disembodied eye.

00:31:26.560 --> 00:31:29.440
 Wikipedia described it as a relief.

00:31:29.440 --> 00:31:38.120
 So have you seen the relief?

00:31:38.120 --> 00:31:39.680
 I've seen it.

00:31:39.680 --> 00:31:41.160
 So it's pretty--

00:31:41.160 --> 00:31:41.840
 It's so weird.

00:31:41.840 --> 00:31:44.120
 The phallus has its own penis, which

00:31:44.120 --> 00:31:45.600
 is doing the ejaculating.

00:31:45.600 --> 00:31:49.040
 So it's a lovely stone-carved relief, as James says.

00:31:49.040 --> 00:31:50.920
 And I think it's in Turkey.

00:31:50.920 --> 00:31:53.640
 And it's a phallus with back legs.

00:31:53.640 --> 00:31:56.160
 And then there's a smaller penis coming down from it.

00:31:56.160 --> 00:31:58.080
 And it's shooting ejaculating into an eye

00:31:58.080 --> 00:31:59.640
 with a scorpion on top of it.

00:31:59.640 --> 00:32:00.680
 Amazing.

00:32:00.680 --> 00:32:02.600
 I like the penis with the little penis.

00:32:02.600 --> 00:32:04.640
 It's like that village in Gloucestershire.

00:32:04.640 --> 00:32:07.640
 Yes.

00:32:07.640 --> 00:32:11.480
 I mean, not exactly like that.

00:32:11.480 --> 00:32:14.280
 Roman prostitutes sold things called colifio,

00:32:14.280 --> 00:32:17.120
 which were little bread rolls shaped like penises.

00:32:17.120 --> 00:32:17.760
 That's a bay.

00:32:17.760 --> 00:32:18.760
 Yeah.

00:32:18.760 --> 00:32:21.720
 And you don't get that in Gregg's, do you?

00:32:21.720 --> 00:32:27.400
 It was a clarify that Gregg's is not

00:32:27.400 --> 00:32:30.200
 a staffed excuse me if I prostitutes.

00:32:30.200 --> 00:32:35.520
 Yes, I would like to try.

00:32:35.520 --> 00:32:38.160
 That's why you keep getting injected from Gregg's James.

00:32:38.160 --> 00:32:43.760
 So there's a theory that the reason we don't know very much

00:32:43.760 --> 00:32:47.000
 about fascinus is that Christians tried

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:49.480
 to eradicate from our collective memory

00:32:49.480 --> 00:32:51.600
 all the weird stuff that the Romans were interested in,

00:32:51.600 --> 00:32:52.960
 like this, because they thought it was a bit

00:32:52.960 --> 00:32:53.880
 prudish.

00:32:53.880 --> 00:32:55.320
 But there's another god called--

00:32:55.320 --> 00:32:57.720
 has a really good name-- called Moutunus Tutunus.

00:32:57.720 --> 00:32:58.560
 And he--

00:32:58.560 --> 00:33:01.640
 [LAUGHTER]

00:33:01.640 --> 00:33:03.000
 Sorry.

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:05.400
 I was midship, and then it was the best day

00:33:05.400 --> 00:33:06.080
 by the way.

00:33:06.080 --> 00:33:07.040
 Yeah, yeah.

00:33:07.040 --> 00:33:08.040
 What was that?

00:33:08.040 --> 00:33:10.600
 Moutunus Tutunus.

00:33:10.600 --> 00:33:13.880
 Mouti Tutu, and nobody ever called him.

00:33:13.880 --> 00:33:16.160
 And he was sort of a god of fertility.

00:33:16.160 --> 00:33:20.280
 And so there was a tradition in which there would be sculptures

00:33:20.280 --> 00:33:23.240
 of Moutunus Tutunus, and he had a large phallus,

00:33:23.240 --> 00:33:25.200
 because that was what he represented.

00:33:25.200 --> 00:33:28.880
 And it has been written that Roman brides

00:33:28.880 --> 00:33:31.600
 to prepare themselves for marriage

00:33:31.600 --> 00:33:34.280
 would have to straddle the phallus of Moutunus

00:33:34.280 --> 00:33:37.400
 to prepare themselves for the upcoming intercourse.

00:33:37.400 --> 00:33:38.600
 He was a dildo.

00:33:38.600 --> 00:33:40.560
 [LAUGHTER]

00:33:40.560 --> 00:33:44.760
 Mouti Tutu, the first dildo.

00:33:44.760 --> 00:33:50.080
 If that's not in the goodie bags at next year's Oscar's eye,

00:33:50.080 --> 00:33:51.720
 you're going to turn down your award.

00:33:51.720 --> 00:33:56.520
 This person is called Faskinus.

00:33:56.520 --> 00:34:00.560
 And another word that comes from this guy, whose name

00:34:00.560 --> 00:34:06.360
 means penis, is fascist, because originally

00:34:06.360 --> 00:34:10.120
 it came from Fasky Sicilianie de Levittori,

00:34:10.120 --> 00:34:13.600
 and the word Fasky came from meaning a group.

00:34:13.600 --> 00:34:15.480
 And that originally was like a bundle,

00:34:15.480 --> 00:34:17.600
 but it also had the same kind of connotations

00:34:17.600 --> 00:34:19.080
 as something large and whatever.

00:34:19.080 --> 00:34:21.040
 And that was where the word fascist came from.

00:34:21.040 --> 00:34:23.520
 What Faskers rods of office, literally,

00:34:23.520 --> 00:34:27.000
 that Roman officials carried to show their authority?

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:29.560
 So basically, all fascists are dicks.

00:34:29.560 --> 00:34:33.120
 [LAUGHTER]

00:34:33.120 --> 00:34:36.840
 If I were you, the rest, you didn't really get into that way.

00:34:36.840 --> 00:34:39.360
 Audience fascists here tonight.

00:34:39.360 --> 00:34:41.520
 I feel like I'm going to be making a lot of spaghetti this evening.

00:34:41.520 --> 00:34:46.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:51.520
 I read, I discovered a new martial art discipline today.

00:34:51.520 --> 00:34:54.160
 It's called 99 Power Chi Gong.

00:34:54.160 --> 00:34:55.280
 So it's part of Chi Gong.

00:34:55.280 --> 00:34:59.280
 It's one of the rarer, practiced bits of Chi Gong and martial

00:34:59.280 --> 00:35:00.160
 arts.

00:35:00.160 --> 00:35:02.720
 Its other name is Iron Crotch.

00:35:02.720 --> 00:35:04.840
 Men of a certain age, suddenly need

00:35:04.840 --> 00:35:07.880
 to start attaching lots of really heavy things to the dick

00:35:07.880 --> 00:35:11.120
 and allow it to just get some exercise.

00:35:11.120 --> 00:35:12.840
 I think that's the kind of thing.

00:35:12.840 --> 00:35:14.000
 There's a guy called Master 2.

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:16.360
 He goes around the world, teaching people how to do this.

00:35:16.360 --> 00:35:18.600
 He's described on his website as a graceful man

00:35:18.600 --> 00:35:21.240
 who moves like a swimming dragon with sudden bursts

00:35:21.240 --> 00:35:22.600
 of thunderous gestures.

00:35:22.600 --> 00:35:24.200
 But what he's mainly known for is that he

00:35:24.200 --> 00:35:26.960
 can tow trucks with his penis.

00:35:26.960 --> 00:35:28.440
 What's wrong with a tow rope?

00:35:28.440 --> 00:35:30.400
 [LAUGHTER]

00:35:30.400 --> 00:35:33.080
 Well, I'm just only mentioning it in case anyone's

00:35:33.080 --> 00:35:35.280
 looking for an interesting Christmas gift to give the someone,

00:35:35.280 --> 00:35:38.680
 because you can buy Iron Crotch the DVD, which is,

00:35:38.680 --> 00:35:41.280
 like those exercise DVDs that you get.

00:35:41.280 --> 00:35:46.080
 And it comes with a rope and a hook to hook.

00:35:46.080 --> 00:35:47.160
 And you'll be able to find that.

00:35:47.160 --> 00:35:48.840
 I know such thing as a fish.com.

00:35:48.840 --> 00:35:53.840
 This Christmas, along with your motunus to tunus still though.

00:35:53.840 --> 00:35:58.160
 And a free copy of Jurassic Shark.

00:35:58.160 --> 00:35:59.840
 OK, I'm going to have to stop us there.

00:35:59.840 --> 00:36:00.680
 OK, that's it.

00:36:00.680 --> 00:36:01.640
