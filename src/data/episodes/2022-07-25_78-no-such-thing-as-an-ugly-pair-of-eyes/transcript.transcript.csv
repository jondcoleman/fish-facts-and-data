00:01:17,00:01:18,On with the show.
00:01:19,00:01:22,[funky music]
00:01:22,00:01:35,Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish
00:01:35,00:01:37,a weekly podcast this week coming to you
00:01:37,00:01:39,from the Edinburgh Fringe Festival.
00:01:39,00:01:40,My name is Dan Schreiber.
00:01:40,00:01:43,Joining me is ever the three qi elves.
00:01:43,00:01:45,"Please welcome to the stage is Andy Murray,"
00:01:45,00:01:48,"Anacisinsky, and James Harkin."
00:01:48,00:01:50,[cheers and applause]
00:01:50,00:01:56,"And once again, we've gathered around the microphones"
00:01:56,00:01:59,with our four favorite facts from the last seven days
00:01:59,00:02:01,"and in no particular order, here we go."
00:02:01,00:02:03,"Starting with you, James Harkin."
00:02:03,00:02:07,"Okay, my fact this week is that Las Vegas hosts"
00:02:07,00:02:11,an awards ceremony for people who make awards.
00:02:11,00:02:13,[laughter]
00:02:13,00:02:15,What do they get?
00:02:15,00:02:17,They get a gold obelisk.
00:02:17,00:02:19,"Oh, that's good, isn't it?"
00:02:19,00:02:22,It's the awards and personalization association
00:02:22,00:02:24,and they celebrate things like best trophy.
00:02:24,00:02:26,That gets an award.
00:02:26,00:02:27,Best plaque.
00:02:27,00:02:28,That gets one.
00:02:28,00:02:29,Best plaque.
00:02:29,00:02:29,Best plaque.
00:02:29,00:02:31,And a best sandblasting.
00:02:31,00:02:33,That's one.
00:02:33,00:02:34,What is that?
00:02:34,00:02:35,I didn't look it up.
00:02:35,00:02:37,[laughter]
00:02:37,00:02:40,"Yeah, the US and Canada industry for awards"
00:02:40,00:02:42,is $3 billion a year.
00:02:42,00:02:44,That's how much people spend on awards.
00:02:44,00:02:47,And that I worked it out is enough to give every person
00:02:47,00:02:51,in the country a three to five inch resin trophy
00:02:51,00:02:52,in the spot of their choice.
00:02:52,00:02:55,[laughter]
00:02:55,00:02:58,That seems a much better way of doing it.
00:02:58,00:03:00,Just do away with all the games and spots.
00:03:00,00:03:01,Just give everyone a trophy.
00:03:01,00:03:02,Yeah.
00:03:02,00:03:03,You're great.
00:03:03,00:03:04,That's amazing.
00:03:04,00:03:06,"That's because, well, they aren't hugely money, don't they?"
00:03:06,00:03:08,"The Oscars, we might have talked about this before,"
00:03:08,00:03:10,"the Oscars, the party bag that you get"
00:03:10,00:03:12,if you're attending the Oscars is extraordinary.
00:03:12,00:03:14,It's worth something like 120 grand per bag.
00:03:14,00:03:17,Last year's or the year before's came with every female
00:03:17,00:03:20,"who'd attended a got in their party bag,"
00:03:20,00:03:22,"genitals stimulator, I think."
00:03:22,00:03:25,"Also, no, it was surgery that can be performed on you"
00:03:25,00:03:27,in order that you have better orgasms.
00:03:27,00:03:29,And every woman who attended the Oscars
00:03:29,00:03:32,got a little voucher for one of these surgeries.
00:03:32,00:03:34,[laughter]
00:03:34,00:03:36,"So yeah, it's good to, it's better than the party bags"
00:03:36,00:03:37,of youth.
00:03:37,00:03:39,[laughter]
00:03:39,00:03:41,"Yeah, it's not a balloon and a bit of cake wrapped"
00:03:41,00:03:43,"in the tissue, is it?"
00:03:43,00:03:46,"Mind you, I think you'd be in trouble at a child birthday party, yeah?"
00:03:46,00:03:50,[laughter]
00:03:50,00:03:52,I started looking up some other awards ceremonies
00:03:52,00:03:54,that the UK has based on this fact.
00:03:54,00:03:58,And you might like to know that there is a British cabab awards
00:03:58,00:04:03,where categories include best newcomer cabab restaurant
00:04:03,00:04:07,"and outstanding contribution to the cabab industry,"
00:04:07,00:04:09,"which this year, I'm sure we all know,"
00:04:09,00:04:14,was one by Edmonton Meat.
00:04:14,00:04:16,How are the acceptance speeches for that?
00:04:16,00:04:18,You just have to slowly turn around as you make a speech.
00:04:18,00:04:22,[laughter]
00:04:22,00:04:24,"Another award ceremony that they have,"
00:04:24,00:04:27,"which I think the prize for this is enormous,"
00:04:27,00:04:28,given the nature of it.
00:04:28,00:04:33,"So the smelly foot contest, the reiki foot competition"
00:04:33,00:04:36,"for which is called the sneaker contest, the sneaker contest."
00:04:36,00:04:40,"And the winner every year gets $2,500,"
00:04:40,00:04:43,"as well as two nights in New York and a trip to a Broadway show,"
00:04:43,00:04:45,which just approving that you're happy to say.
00:04:45,00:04:46,But having smelly feet.
00:04:46,00:04:46,Yeah.
00:04:46,00:04:48,How's it judged?
00:04:48,00:04:50,It's the panel of judges.
00:04:50,00:04:51,"I can tell you how it's judged,"
00:04:51,00:04:54,because I actually coincidentally googled this as well.
00:04:54,00:04:55,[laughter]
00:04:55,00:04:58,"They check the condition of your heel of your shoe,"
00:04:58,00:05:01,"the sole, the tongue, the shoelaces,"
00:05:01,00:05:05,"the older of the shoe, which is tested by a group of people,"
00:05:05,00:05:07,one of whom is NASA's sniffer.
00:05:07,00:05:08,No.
00:05:08,00:05:11,The guy who smells everything before it goes up in space.
00:05:11,00:05:12,"Oh, this guy's incredible."
00:05:12,00:05:15,Nothing goes into space unless he goes under his nose.
00:05:15,00:05:16,"And he goes, yep."
00:05:16,00:05:19,That's the only way it goes into space.
00:05:19,00:05:21,"If he doesn't like the smell, it does not go to space."
00:05:21,00:05:24,This is the most powerful set of nostrils on our planet.
00:05:24,00:05:26,"And he gets test four times every year,"
00:05:26,00:05:29,where they put beakers of different smells under his nose.
00:05:29,00:05:32,"Some contain no smells, some contain a tiny trace."
00:05:32,00:05:34,"And if he fails, he loses his job."
00:05:34,00:05:36,He has never failed.
00:05:36,00:05:37,He's got the best nostrils on the planet.
00:05:37,00:05:39,"And even if he did fail, he's got a lucrative sneaker"
00:05:39,00:05:42,judging career to fall back on.
00:05:42,00:05:44,And so the other thing that these guys do in the competition
00:05:44,00:05:47,is that the entrant has to give a verbal response
00:05:47,00:05:50,"to the question, why he stroke she feels"
00:05:50,00:05:53,that he stroke she has rotten sneakers
00:05:53,00:05:55,and how they got that way.
00:05:55,00:05:57,"And last year's winner, Ken Jung-Hiss,"
00:05:57,00:06:01,"answered the question with, I bike and high coffin."
00:06:01,00:06:02,I've worn them through mud.
00:06:02,00:06:07,"And also through chicken, pigeon, goose, and dove poop."
00:06:07,00:06:08,And they also don't wear socks.
00:06:08,00:06:10,[LAUGHTER]
00:06:10,00:06:12,So that was her answer?
00:06:12,00:06:13,"Oh, the sock bit got you."
00:06:13,00:06:14,That was--
00:06:14,00:06:16,[LAUGHTER]
00:06:16,00:06:19,"Oh, yeah, and you get into the hall of fumes, don't you?"
00:06:19,00:06:21,"The odouritas hall of fumes, if you win it."
00:06:21,00:06:22,That's a very clever contest.
00:06:22,00:06:23,"No, that's actually true."
00:06:23,00:06:25,There wasn't me making a really bad joke.
00:06:25,00:06:26,[LAUGHTER]
00:06:26,00:06:28,Where you go?
00:06:28,00:06:31,"Supposedly, the original trophy was an ancient Greek word."
00:06:31,00:06:33,"And it comes at Trophane, it's what it was originally."
00:06:33,00:06:37,And it was when you hung your dead enemy's armor
00:06:37,00:06:38,on a tree after a battle.
00:06:38,00:06:40,So everyone could see that you had won.
00:06:40,00:06:42,"Yeah, nice."
00:06:42,00:06:44,Have you guys heard of the Golden Colour Awards?
00:06:44,00:06:44,No.
00:06:44,00:06:47,"Which are a really big deal, apparently."
00:06:47,00:06:49,"Every year, there's an award ceremony"
00:06:49,00:06:52,that follows the Oscars for the best dogs in films.
00:06:52,00:06:53,Really?
00:06:53,00:06:53,"Yeah, yeah."
00:06:53,00:06:54,And you get the same category.
00:06:54,00:06:57,"So you get the best dog in a theatrical film,"
00:06:57,00:06:59,which I think the dog in the artist
00:06:59,00:07:01,won it in the year I was reading it out.
00:07:01,00:07:03,RIP just passed away.
00:07:03,00:07:05,"Oh, no, no."
00:07:05,00:07:05,Sorry.
00:07:05,00:07:06,It's not breaking news.
00:07:06,00:07:08,"It happened ages ago, just no one knows,"
00:07:08,00:07:08,because no one cares.
00:07:08,00:07:11,It's not like a--
00:07:11,00:07:13,"Well, after his death, he might have taken part"
00:07:13,00:07:19,"in the UK's Good Funeral Awards, which is a real thing."
00:07:19,00:07:23,"Categories include Cemetery of the Year,"
00:07:23,00:07:27,"Embarmer of the Year, Major Contribution"
00:07:27,00:07:29,to the Understanding of Death.
00:07:29,00:07:30,Wow.
00:07:30,00:07:31,Wow.
00:07:31,00:07:33,And the final look at in my favorite
00:07:33,00:07:34,is Grave Digger of the Year.
00:07:34,00:07:37,[LAUGHTER]
00:07:37,00:07:38,That's real.
00:07:38,00:07:40,What is it to dig a good grave?
00:07:40,00:07:40,Yeah.
00:07:40,00:07:41,What is the qualifications?
00:07:41,00:07:42,Is it like quality of policy?
00:07:42,00:07:43,I don't know if it's a policy.
00:07:43,00:07:46,Strength or speed or death?
00:07:46,00:07:47,Death?
00:07:47,00:07:49,"I mean, because there's a famous term that sort of gives it"
00:07:49,00:07:52,"a sort of bottom ceiling, as it were, 60."
00:07:52,00:07:54,I don't like the phrase bottom ceiling at all.
00:07:54,00:07:55,Yes.
00:07:55,00:07:57,[LAUGHTER]
00:07:57,00:08:04,"And I'm like, OK, we always lose that at some stage."
00:08:04,00:08:05,It was a bit early today.
00:08:05,00:08:06,"Not really, tonight, yeah."
00:08:06,00:08:10,"So speaking of bottoms, something"
00:08:10,00:08:13,"you could do with your bottom, relating to awards ceremonies,"
00:08:13,00:08:15,"is be a seat filler at the Oscars, right?"
00:08:15,00:08:17,And I think we should try and do that.
00:08:17,00:08:19,But so I think you can only get the job
00:08:19,00:08:22,"if you work for PWC, which sponsors the Oscars,"
00:08:22,00:08:23,or if you know someone involved.
00:08:23,00:08:26,But it's because if the camera pans out to the audience
00:08:26,00:08:29,"and like, you know, live Tyler, or whoever's famous these days,"
00:08:29,00:08:31,"goes to the toilet, then it looks like there's an empty seat."
00:08:31,00:08:32,And so you've got to wait there in the wings.
00:08:32,00:08:34,"And as soon as the famous person stands up,"
00:08:34,00:08:35,then you've got to run into their seats
00:08:35,00:08:36,in extra George Clooney for a bit.
00:08:36,00:08:38,But your unrestricted instructions
00:08:38,00:08:40,not to interact with any of the actual invitees.
00:08:40,00:08:42,"This isn't funny, but I have that."
00:08:42,00:08:43,The national television awards.
00:08:43,00:08:46,"We went on stage, and then people came in our seats."
00:08:46,00:08:47,"And then afterwards, we had to--"
00:08:47,00:08:49,[LAUGHTER]
00:08:49,00:08:55,I used to do that job weirdly.
00:08:55,00:08:57,How I met everyone at QI was--
00:08:57,00:09:01,[LAUGHTER]
00:09:01,00:09:02,"You told-- because I would have thought,"
00:09:02,00:09:04,"if I'd gone and got an Oscar and gone back,"
00:09:04,00:09:05,and someone would stolen my seat.
00:09:05,00:09:09,"I'd just be like, what the fuck are you doing in my seat?"
00:09:09,00:09:10,I was reading an article about the Oscars.
00:09:10,00:09:11,And they make about--
00:09:11,00:09:13,I think it's about 50 every year.
00:09:13,00:09:14,Yeah.
00:09:14,00:09:16,"And you're not allowed to sell them, either, are you?"
00:09:16,00:09:18,I thought you had to offer them back to the Academy Awards
00:09:18,00:09:19,first for a dollar.
00:09:19,00:09:20,"For a long dollar, yeah."
00:09:20,00:09:21,"And then if the Academy Awards were like, oh,"
00:09:21,00:09:24,"we can't really afford that, then--"
00:09:24,00:09:27,Then you can put your Oscar on the Ebay.
00:09:27,00:09:28,"We'd love to afford it, but unfortunately,"
00:09:28,00:09:29,we blew all the budget for this year
00:09:29,00:09:32,on buying every woman who attends Magic for Dinosurgery.
00:09:32,00:09:35,[LAUGHTER]
00:09:35,00:09:37,And I have a few recursive things.
00:09:37,00:09:38,Can I say those?
00:09:38,00:09:40,So this is an award ceremony for awards.
00:09:40,00:09:44,There's a village called Barton on the Water in Gloucestershire.
00:09:44,00:09:47,And it has a one-nights scale exact replica
00:09:47,00:09:49,of the village inside the village.
00:09:49,00:09:53,But that replica also has a village inside of it.
00:09:53,00:09:56,And that replica has a village inside of it.
00:09:56,00:09:59,"And the recursion stops after level four-- well, five,"
00:09:59,00:10:00,if you include the original village.
00:10:00,00:10:01,Yeah.
00:10:01,00:10:03,"But yes, got five villages inside a village inside a village"
00:10:03,00:10:04,inside a village.
00:10:04,00:10:09,"Have you guys heard of Alice Brady, who won an Oscar in 1938?"
00:10:09,00:10:11,She won the Best Actress Oscar in Best Supporting Actress
00:10:11,00:10:13,in a film called In Old Chicago.
00:10:13,00:10:15,And she was unable to make it.
00:10:15,00:10:17,So I think she was either on holiday or she was sick.
00:10:17,00:10:18,Everyone knew she was unable to make it.
00:10:18,00:10:20,So someone went and picked up the Oscar in her place
00:10:20,00:10:21,at the ceremony.
00:10:21,00:10:24,"Turns out, no one knows who that person was."
00:10:24,00:10:25,She had an sanction at all.
00:10:25,00:10:27,And someone just walked over the Oscar.
00:10:27,00:10:28,No one's ever found out where that is.
00:10:28,00:10:29,Wow.
00:10:29,00:10:30,I was.
00:10:30,00:10:32,They just need to search for a person
00:10:32,00:10:34,with vaginal surgery.
00:10:34,00:10:36,Check it against all the records.
00:10:36,00:10:38,Go ahead and search for that claim.
00:10:38,00:10:42,"Oh, you guys are not googling hard enough."
00:10:42,00:10:44,Should we move on to our next act?
00:10:44,00:10:46,"OK, time for fact number two."
00:10:46,00:10:48,And that is Andrew Hunter Murray.
00:10:48,00:10:50,My fact is that Napoleon loved Rose
00:10:50,00:10:52,chicken so much that his household chefs
00:10:52,00:10:57,"were constantly cooking some in case he decided he wanted any,"
00:10:57,00:11:00,which is my personal aim for my life.
00:11:00,00:11:02,I think that's when you know you've made it.
00:11:02,00:11:04,"But so is this-- I mean, is there a lot of--"
00:11:04,00:11:07,"is chicken sort of really, if you read an Napoleon biography,"
00:11:07,00:11:08,is it just everywhere?
00:11:08,00:11:10,Is it just constant mentions of chicken?
00:11:10,00:11:10,Or--
00:11:10,00:11:15,Barely a page goes by in the 700 page Napoleon biography.
00:11:15,00:11:17,He was more chicken than man by the end.
00:11:17,00:11:23,"No, I don't know, it's just something that was an article"
00:11:23,00:11:24,"about it recently, which I spotted."
00:11:24,00:11:27,"This was at his palace in Paris, the twelery."
00:11:27,00:11:30,And just chicken was constantly being cooked on a spit
00:11:30,00:11:32,because he was very erratic in the way he ate.
00:11:32,00:11:34,He would have meals at odd times of day.
00:11:34,00:11:38,And he wasn't breakfast lunch and dinner sort of man.
00:11:38,00:11:41,Once when he went on a journey from Cairo to--
00:11:41,00:11:42,"oh, where was it?"
00:11:42,00:11:43,I think Suez.
00:11:43,00:11:45,He just took three roast chickens wrapped in paper
00:11:45,00:11:46,as his provisions with him.
00:11:46,00:11:48,"So yeah, he loved it."
00:11:48,00:11:51,Found it quite a cool Mussolini had a code word
00:11:51,00:11:54,that he used to tell his wife whenever he was doing something
00:11:54,00:11:55,at the table.
00:11:55,00:11:58,And he didn't want his mother-in-law to know what he was doing.
00:11:58,00:12:00,What was he doing at the table?
00:12:00,00:12:02,Is it the same as what these people were doing at my awards?
00:12:02,00:12:05,[LAUGHTER]
00:12:05,00:12:07,"Sorry, I should clarify, it's once he left the table"
00:12:07,00:12:09,that he started doing the thing.
00:12:09,00:12:11,So he loved joling with swords.
00:12:11,00:12:13,He was really obsessed with joling with swords.
00:12:13,00:12:16,And so he got into fights all the time with people.
00:12:16,00:12:18,Over just minor little things.
00:12:18,00:12:21,"And he would say at the breakfast table, to his wife,"
00:12:21,00:12:25,"this was the line, today we are making spaghetti."
00:12:25,00:12:28,"And that was code to say, today I'm going outside"
00:12:28,00:12:30,to fight another man with swords.
00:12:30,00:12:31,And I--
00:12:31,00:12:31,Yeah.
00:12:31,00:12:33,What happened if he actually was eating spaghetti one day?
00:12:33,00:12:35,And then some guy just came at him with a sword
00:12:35,00:12:37,because he thought it was a code.
00:12:37,00:12:38,"Yeah, and it's a confusing code."
00:12:38,00:12:38,I agree.
00:12:38,00:12:40,"And also, I bet, at the same time, the mother-in-law,"
00:12:40,00:12:42,"because she was living with them, would probably be going,"
00:12:42,00:12:44,"ooh, spaghetti tonight then."
00:12:44,00:12:46,"And no matter what was the plans for dinner,"
00:12:46,00:12:49,"would suddenly be changed, because Mussolini wanted a fight."
00:12:49,00:12:51,You've just got a cooked man's hand here.
00:12:51,00:12:53,What happened today with this spaghetti?
00:12:53,00:12:55,How many secrets did he keep from his mother?
00:12:55,00:12:57,Did he have a code for I'm going to enslave a nation
00:12:57,00:12:59,and then go to war with various other nations?
00:12:59,00:13:01,Was that--
00:13:01,00:13:04,"No, I'm going to feed the cat."
00:13:04,00:13:06,"Yeah, just as a side note to this fact,"
00:13:06,00:13:09,I found a website all about rabbits during the course
00:13:09,00:13:11,of my research called Napoleon Bunny Part.
00:13:14,00:13:16,Just so you knew.
00:13:16,00:13:18,Was Napoleon once not attacked by rabbits?
00:13:18,00:13:20,"There is this story, yeah."
00:13:20,00:13:22,And it's hard to know what's propaganda.
00:13:22,00:13:25,It's been explained as his biggest ever defeat
00:13:25,00:13:27,that he was attacked by bunnies on a battlefield
00:13:27,00:13:28,and had to run away or something like that.
00:13:28,00:13:31,"Yeah, I thought it was when he was visiting Egypt, possibly."
00:13:31,00:13:34,"But yeah, he was mobbed by rabbits when he was out hunting"
00:13:34,00:13:35,while shooting.
00:13:35,00:13:37,"And people always think he's afraid of cats, don't they?"
00:13:37,00:13:39,Which I don't think is true.
00:13:39,00:13:40,But I think they're confusing him with Napoleon
00:13:40,00:13:44,"and the third is nephew, who used to have to jump onto a table"
00:13:44,00:13:47,if a cat entered the room or like climb up the curtains
00:13:47,00:13:48,to avoid it.
00:13:48,00:13:51,That's one thing cats can do if they were cats.
00:13:51,00:13:53,Yeah.
00:13:53,00:13:53,That's weird.
00:13:53,00:13:54,Not a smart man.
00:13:54,00:13:55,That's why he doesn't have the--
00:13:55,00:13:57,"Yeah, the cute also to his uncle does."
00:13:57,00:14:00,Josephine's dog really hated Napoleon.
00:14:00,00:14:00,Yeah.
00:14:00,00:14:02,"And apparently during the wedding night,"
00:14:02,00:14:05,"it bit him on the leg while he was asleep, not during the--"
00:14:05,00:14:06,OK.
00:14:06,00:14:07,"So they had a problem with animals, didn't they?"
00:14:07,00:14:09,I wonder if his actual--
00:14:09,00:14:11,the rest of his life has actually distracted us
00:14:11,00:14:13,from the fact that he was the one human on Earth who
00:14:13,00:14:15,animals all hated unanimously.
00:14:15,00:14:18,And we've been blinded to that actual real extraordinary fact
00:14:18,00:14:19,about a man.
00:14:19,00:14:21,There was another Napoleon.
00:14:21,00:14:24,I think one of the very last members of Napoleon family
00:14:24,00:14:26,are Jerome Bonaparte.
00:14:26,00:14:27,Jerome Bonaparte?
00:14:27,00:14:28,Jerome Bonaparte.
00:14:28,00:14:30,They moved to New York.
00:14:30,00:14:31,"Or the fact no, they did."
00:14:31,00:14:34,"Guys, let's stop it."
00:14:34,00:14:38,"They escaped after the fall of Napoleon,"
00:14:38,00:14:40,lots of his family members with lots and lots of money.
00:14:40,00:14:42,And one of them died.
00:14:42,00:14:43,"Jerome Bonaparte, I think it was, died"
00:14:43,00:14:46,after tripping over two entangled dog leads
00:14:46,00:14:47,while out on a walk.
00:14:47,00:14:48,"Oh, my God."
00:14:48,00:14:49,Oh.
00:14:49,00:14:50,Yeah.
00:14:50,00:14:52,Ooh.
00:14:52,00:14:54,"Well, also, he had problems with horse ride."
00:14:54,00:14:55,I'm loving this theory.
00:14:55,00:14:57,I really think you might be right.
00:14:57,00:15:01,So some historians speculate that the reason that he lost water
00:15:01,00:15:05,"glue is because he had incredibly bad hemorrhoids, which"
00:15:05,00:15:07,"was a serious problem for him that repeated throughout his life,"
00:15:07,00:15:09,"and that he couldn't sit on his horse throughout that day,"
00:15:09,00:15:10,which is due.
00:15:10,00:15:12,So I think we don't have any evidence that he rode his horse.
00:15:12,00:15:15,And so he couldn't survey the battlefield properly.
00:15:15,00:15:17,And he couldn't ride his horses into battle.
00:15:17,00:15:19,He had to stay backstage because he couldn't sit
00:15:19,00:15:19,in a saddle.
00:15:19,00:15:20,It was too painful.
00:15:20,00:15:21,And there we go.
00:15:21,00:15:22,That was the end of everything.
00:15:22,00:15:24,So you just thought he were high enough?
00:15:24,00:15:25,"I mean, he wasn't that short."
00:15:25,00:15:27,"This is a myth that he was short, wasn't it?"
00:15:27,00:15:29,"Yeah, he was kind of short."
00:15:29,00:15:33,"He was, I think he was an inch taller than Sarkozy."
00:15:33,00:15:34,OK.
00:15:34,00:15:35,"But at the time, he was taller than the average Frenchman."
00:15:35,00:15:36,Yes.
00:15:36,00:15:38,"He was taller than Nelson, I'm sorry to say."
00:15:38,00:15:41,But it is weird how often I was reading a thing of first-hand
00:15:41,00:15:42,sources about Napoleon.
00:15:42,00:15:44,And it's weird how often people point out
00:15:44,00:15:46,"his small stature, given that we say"
00:15:46,00:15:47,that he was above average height.
00:15:47,00:15:50,Maybe he just seems-- you know when you see someone who seems
00:15:50,00:15:52,"like their small, but actually they're six foot."
00:15:52,00:15:56,Maybe he's just at a very small demeanor.
00:15:56,00:15:56,I don't know.
00:15:56,00:15:59,Why were people always going on about it?
00:15:59,00:16:01,Can I tell you someone else who likes chicken?
00:16:01,00:16:02,Yeah.
00:16:02,00:16:03,Yeah.
00:16:03,00:16:07,"Is it-- is it-- I, James, like chicken."
00:16:07,00:16:10,"No, it's Stacy Irving from Birmingham, of course."
00:16:10,00:16:11,She eats chicken nuggets.
00:16:11,00:16:12,It's the only thing she eats.
00:16:12,00:16:14,Chicken nuggets all the time.
00:16:14,00:16:18,She has 20 a day that she shares with her boyfriend.
00:16:18,00:16:21,"And doxas have one that is very, very, very bad for her health,"
00:16:21,00:16:22,just eating chicken nuggets.
00:16:22,00:16:28,"I mean, if she shares them, she's not having 20 a day, then that's like--"
00:16:28,00:16:30,"I mean, she is kind of like, it is really bad for her health."
00:16:30,00:16:32,"But the newspaper article said,"
00:16:32,00:16:34,a less serious consequence of her craving
00:16:34,00:16:37,is that she's struggling to start all of the free toys
00:16:37,00:16:40,that come with a fast food meal.
00:16:40,00:16:42,"So she might be dying, but yeah, where"
00:16:42,00:16:44,is she going to keep those toys?
00:16:44,00:16:45,What is it?
00:16:45,00:16:47,The world's largest chicken nugget is twice
00:16:47,00:16:49,the size of the world's largest chicken nugget?
00:16:49,00:16:50,I think it is.
00:16:50,00:16:52,"Whoa, really?"
00:16:52,00:16:53,Yeah.
00:16:53,00:16:55,Imagine finding that in the box.
00:16:55,00:17:00,"Someone else, actually, you'll probably"
00:17:00,00:17:03,know this Gary Watkinson from Huddersfield.
00:17:03,00:17:04,Of course he is.
00:17:04,00:17:07,He only eats beans on toast.
00:17:07,00:17:09,"That's the only thing he ever, ever eats."
00:17:09,00:17:11,"And it's from ever, since he can remember."
00:17:11,00:17:13,"But he actually said, the beans on toast thing"
00:17:13,00:17:15,is only more recent.
00:17:15,00:17:17,"Before that, it was just beans and toast separately."
00:17:17,00:17:26,"And then, like a second Einstein, one day,"
00:17:26,00:17:27,a moment of inspiration.
00:17:27,00:17:32,[LAUGHTER]
00:17:32,00:17:35,"Yeah, Evonne Wake from the Nutrition Society said,"
00:17:35,00:17:38,Gary is probably not constipated.
00:17:38,00:17:39,[LAUGHTER]
00:17:39,00:17:46,I read it.
00:17:46,00:17:50,So just on the subject of leaders and food.
00:17:50,00:17:53,So a lot of leaders get given international gifts all the time.
00:17:53,00:17:55,"I'm thinking, in particular, of the American presidents."
00:17:55,00:17:59,"Two pandas were given to Nixon, that kind of thing."
00:17:59,00:18:03,"I discovered that LBJ, Lyndon B. Johnson,"
00:18:03,00:18:09,"was given by an unnamed source, a Chinese chef called Mr. Wong,"
00:18:09,00:18:12,who just rocked up to the White House door.
00:18:12,00:18:14,And he used to-- there's all these reports.
00:18:14,00:18:15,No one really knew what he was doing there.
00:18:15,00:18:18,Mr. Wong just lived with them during his term.
00:18:18,00:18:20,They were trying to go to the holiday retreat that they
00:18:20,00:18:22,"go to, and they couldn't find Mr. Wong,"
00:18:22,00:18:23,"because they were bringing him, because he decided"
00:18:23,00:18:25,to play hide-and-seek with the president.
00:18:25,00:18:29,And they eventually found him behind some curtains
00:18:29,00:18:31,after a good long search.
00:18:31,00:18:35,But he was hiding from a cat to be there.
00:18:35,00:18:37,That's a-- presidents aren't allowed to accept gifts
00:18:37,00:18:38,that are worth more than something like $5.
00:18:38,00:18:41,So he must have been an extremely cheap man.
00:18:41,00:18:43,I don't know.
00:18:43,00:18:46,"Did you know that fittingly, someone bought--"
00:18:46,00:18:49,so Napoleon has two of those hats that survived
00:18:49,00:18:50,"in Napoleonic hats, and one of them"
00:18:50,00:18:53,was bought for 1.5 million pounds last year.
00:18:53,00:18:56,And it was bought by a chicken mogul.
00:18:56,00:18:59,It was bought by this Korean guy who
00:18:59,00:19:02,"owns a chain of chicken, fried chicken restaurants,"
00:19:02,00:19:04,"the Ha Rim group, which I think provides"
00:19:04,00:19:06,fried chicken to the people of Korea.
00:19:06,00:19:09,"So on things of Napoleon's being sold,"
00:19:09,00:19:15,"in 2006, one of Napoleon's teeth was sold for 11,000 pounds."
00:19:15,00:19:17,"In June, this year, a couple of months ago,"
00:19:17,00:19:20,a single one of Napoleon's hairs was sold at auction
00:19:20,00:19:21,for 130 pounds.
00:19:21,00:19:23,"And I think we've said before on this podcast that,"
00:19:23,00:19:27,"after he died, Napoleon's penis was removed and mummified,"
00:19:27,00:19:28,"and has passed through several hands,"
00:19:28,00:19:29,and has been auctioned several times.
00:19:29,00:19:31,But I have a theory that someone out there
00:19:31,00:19:33,is reassembling Napoleon.
00:19:33,00:19:37,[LAUGHTER]
00:19:37,00:19:40,I think the hair thing is a small victory for Napoleon
00:19:40,00:19:41,against Wellington.
00:19:41,00:19:43,"Because-- so later on, the hairs obviously"
00:19:43,00:19:45,"depreciated in value, because in the '90s,"
00:19:45,00:19:49,"a lock of Napoleon's hair sold for 3,680 pounds at auction."
00:19:49,00:19:53,"And I think the same year, Wellington's hair only got 598."
00:19:53,00:19:55,So that's quite a nice-- it's like balances out
00:19:55,00:19:58,the record between those guys.
00:19:58,00:20:00,A penguin named Napoleon Boulder Parts
00:20:00,00:20:02,has fallen in love with a Wellington boot.
00:20:02,00:20:06,[LAUGHTER]
00:20:06,00:20:09,"Can you imagine if we don't know really what reincarnation is,"
00:20:09,00:20:12,"but everything is conscious, and that's"
00:20:12,00:20:15,they're actually just having a-- sorry about that past life.
00:20:15,00:20:17,I hope you're well.
00:20:17,00:20:18,"They never met, did they?"
00:20:18,00:20:18,Did they not?
00:20:18,00:20:19,Never met.
00:20:19,00:20:23,"But so once the English had defeated the French,"
00:20:23,00:20:26,Wellington had an idea that he presented the British government
00:20:26,00:20:29,"that was disgust that rather than sent him into exile,"
00:20:29,00:20:32,"they built him a house, really near Wellington's house,"
00:20:32,00:20:34,somewhere on the British coastline.
00:20:34,00:20:35,And they lived near each other.
00:20:35,00:20:37,And they just hang out on an exchange
00:20:37,00:20:40,like strategic tips and anecdotes.
00:20:40,00:20:42,"I mean, what a great idea."
00:20:42,00:20:43,Who can I boss that plan?
00:20:43,00:20:45,Because that sounds fantastic.
00:20:45,00:20:47,We've said on the show that Wellington was obsessed with Napoleon.
00:20:47,00:20:49,He bought all of Napoleon's stuff after Waterloo.
00:20:49,00:20:52,And he hired Napoleon's ex-cook.
00:20:52,00:20:54,"The mysterious and everlasting, Mr. Wong."
00:20:54,00:20:59,[LAUGHTER]
00:20:59,00:21:01,I'm going to have to move us on in a second.
00:21:01,00:21:03,Has anyone got anything else?
00:21:03,00:21:04,I've got one last thing.
00:21:04,00:21:06,"This is-- it's not particularly interesting or anything,"
00:21:06,00:21:09,"but it's just a hard sell down, please."
00:21:09,00:21:10,But sometimes you read a sentence.
00:21:10,00:21:13,You think that's the best sentence I've read today.
00:21:13,00:21:14,So it's just this.
00:21:14,00:21:17,Stalin loved bananas and would be furious if you served him
00:21:17,00:21:18,a substandard banana.
00:21:18,00:21:21,[LAUGHTER]
00:21:21,00:21:23,"OK, it's time for fact number three."
00:21:23,00:21:24,And that is my fact.
00:21:24,00:21:28,My fact this week is that IMDB was originally just
00:21:28,00:21:33,a list of actresses with beautiful eyes.
00:21:33,00:21:37,It just started as this little list that the guy created.
00:21:37,00:21:39,"And he just thought, I need to put together"
00:21:39,00:21:41,a list of all the actresses that I think
00:21:41,00:21:43,people need to know have beautiful eyes.
00:21:43,00:21:45,And then people started going to and adding other lists.
00:21:45,00:21:47,And then IMDB grew out of it.
00:21:47,00:21:49,"And it was called ""Those Eyes"" to begin with."
00:21:49,00:21:50,That's the original name.
00:21:50,00:21:50,Wow.
00:21:50,00:21:53,The way it brought his Colneedman brought together two things
00:21:53,00:21:54,to turn them into IMDB.
00:21:54,00:21:57,"And people often say, IMDB grew out of this list of women"
00:21:57,00:21:58,with beautiful eyes.
00:21:58,00:22:00,"And what he brought together was, one of those things"
00:22:00,00:22:03,was the list of actresses with beautiful eyes.
00:22:03,00:22:05,"And then the other thing he brought in, just a little addon,"
00:22:05,00:22:07,"was a list that someone else had created, which"
00:22:07,00:22:10,"was a movie ratings report, where participants were asked"
00:22:10,00:22:12,to rate movies on a 1 to 10 scale.
00:22:12,00:22:15,But it was mainly based IMDB on the actresses
00:22:15,00:22:16,with beautiful eyes.
00:22:16,00:22:18,"I mean, it sounds like the actresses with beautiful eyes"
00:22:18,00:22:20,"was kind of a random, irrelevant list"
00:22:20,00:22:22,that just happened outside it.
00:22:22,00:22:23,He sort of put them all together.
00:22:23,00:22:25,He recalls the details of every film that he sees.
00:22:25,00:22:28,And he has done since he was 13 years old Colneedman.
00:22:28,00:22:30,And he has seen-- this was 18 months ago.
00:22:30,00:22:31,So he's seen more since then.
00:22:31,00:22:35,"But at that count, it was 8,505."
00:22:35,00:22:39,That's one film for every 48 hours since he was born.
00:22:39,00:22:40,Wow.
00:22:40,00:22:42,"His favorite film is ""Vertigo."""
00:22:42,00:22:43,Really?
00:22:43,00:22:45,And that's why it always tops the charts.
00:22:45,00:22:46,Yes.
00:22:46,00:22:48,"He's rigging it, isn't he?"
00:22:48,00:22:49,Because it's a good film.
00:22:49,00:22:53,But I read an article that said that he and his--
00:22:53,00:22:54,it was a quote by him.
00:22:54,00:22:57,He said that he and his wife love going to the cinema.
00:22:57,00:23:00,And they watch a film together every Tuesday lunchtime.
00:23:00,00:23:02,But what it sounds like is they do do that.
00:23:02,00:23:04,"But the rest of the time, it's just him watching loads"
00:23:04,00:23:05,of other movies.
00:23:05,00:23:07,"So it's more like, my wife has begrudgingly agreed"
00:23:07,00:23:09,to come to the cinema with me once a week.
00:23:09,00:23:11,"Otherwise, we would never see each other."
00:23:11,00:23:13,[LAUGHTER]
00:23:13,00:23:15,"And when he was a boy, he rented out the film Alien."
00:23:15,00:23:17,And he watched it every single day for a fortnight.
00:23:17,00:23:18,Wow.
00:23:18,00:23:19,That's a waste of his time.
00:23:19,00:23:21,He needs to be getting through these films.
00:23:21,00:23:22,Yeah.
00:23:22,00:23:24,"Well, he said that recently there are so many more good films"
00:23:24,00:23:25,being made these days.
00:23:25,00:23:27,It was just that at the time that was one of the best films
00:23:27,00:23:28,ever made.
00:23:28,00:23:29,And it was so huge.
00:23:29,00:23:31,It is a fantastic place.
00:23:31,00:23:33,I actually do a fair bit of QI research
00:23:33,00:23:35,by looking at the IMDB.
00:23:35,00:23:36,Did you know section?
00:23:36,00:23:39,"I love reading the user reviews, because the honesty of it"
00:23:39,00:23:41,"is just, here's my favorite one."
00:23:41,00:23:44,I haven't even read further than the title of this review.
00:23:44,00:23:47,But it was for the movie Batman and Robin.
00:23:47,00:23:49,"And the headline was, I lost faith in humanity."
00:23:49,00:23:53,[LAUGHTER]
00:23:53,00:23:54,Sign the Joker.
00:23:54,00:23:56,[LAUGHTER]
00:23:56,00:24:00,Do you know what is the bottom ranked movie on all of IMDB?
00:24:00,00:24:01,No.
00:24:01,00:24:04,It's called Jurassic Shark.
00:24:04,00:24:06,It's from 2012.
00:24:06,00:24:08,It's got a rating of 1.5%.
00:24:08,00:24:09,And here's what it is.
00:24:09,00:24:12,"It's, when an oil company on Wittingly Unleashes,"
00:24:12,00:24:15,"a prehistoric shark from its icy prison,"
00:24:15,00:24:18,the Jurassic Killan maroons a group of thieves
00:24:18,00:24:21,and a beautiful young female college student
00:24:21,00:24:24,on an abandoned piece of land.
00:24:24,00:24:26,"How did they manage to screw that up, though?"
00:24:26,00:24:28,Because that sounds like such a winning.
00:24:28,00:24:29,This film.
00:24:29,00:24:32,"I'll give you some others in the bottom, like 20 or something."
00:24:32,00:24:35,The Hottie and the Nottie from 2008.
00:24:35,00:24:37,"Oh, it's a Paris Hilton movie."
00:24:37,00:24:39,"Oh, is it?"
00:24:39,00:24:39,Apparently.
00:24:39,00:24:42,Apparently.
00:24:42,00:24:45,I think we found that why it's not at the absolute bottom.
00:24:45,00:24:47,[LAUGHTER]
00:24:47,00:24:50,Do you know the-- so there's one film on IMDB which
00:24:50,00:24:54,"isn't marked out of 10, which is Spinal Tap,"
00:24:54,00:24:57,and the IMDB page marks that it's rating as marked out of 11.
00:24:57,00:24:59,So it gives 8 out of 11.
00:24:59,00:25:00,"Which, and then--"
00:25:00,00:25:02,"Oh, which actually really affects how good a movie it is"
00:25:02,00:25:03,in the overall rating because--
00:25:03,00:25:04,"Yeah, so it's really annoying because I worry"
00:25:04,00:25:06,"that people have a notice, and they're giving it an 8,"
00:25:06,00:25:07,"thinking that's out of 10, and that's 80%."
00:25:07,00:25:08,But it's not.
00:25:08,00:25:10,It's obviously X% that I'm not going to patronize you
00:25:10,00:25:12,by working out here myself right now.
00:25:12,00:25:16,[LAUGHTER]
00:25:16,00:25:18,"Yeah, it's a lower percent."
00:25:18,00:25:18,Yeah.
00:25:18,00:25:20,It should be higher than 8 out of 11.
00:25:20,00:25:24,I read them at cracked.com article about the most depressing
00:25:24,00:25:26,IMDB pages.
00:25:26,00:25:29,"Their top one was someone called Leslie Bremer,"
00:25:29,00:25:32,and she's only had nine roles in her whole career.
00:25:32,00:25:37,"They include Girl in Bikini, Shower Girl, Party Girl,"
00:25:37,00:25:40,and Girl Leaving Room.
00:25:40,00:25:43,"She's only had one named party in her entire career,"
00:25:43,00:25:48,and she played Sandy in a movie called School Spirit.
00:25:48,00:25:50,"But on IMDB, it says, in several scenes,"
00:25:50,00:25:54,actress Leslie can be seen wearing a necklace with the letter L
00:25:54,00:25:57,"on it, despite the fact that her character's name is Sandy."
00:25:57,00:26:01,[LAUGHTER]
00:26:01,00:26:02,I'm going to have to move us on in a sec.
00:26:02,00:26:04,We're going to power through to the last one.
00:26:04,00:26:05,Anyone got anything else?
00:26:05,00:26:08,I looked up IMDB's current poll of actresses
00:26:08,00:26:10,"with beautiful eyes, and it's just a list."
00:26:10,00:26:11,It's really weird.
00:26:11,00:26:13,"So there are lots of people who submitted their own lists,"
00:26:13,00:26:15,but their own curator ones.
00:26:15,00:26:17,But this one's a poll which takes others users into account.
00:26:17,00:26:21,"So the top 20 is all people like Cameron Diaz, Rachel Fies,"
00:26:21,00:26:23,"Natalie Portman, other people like that."
00:26:23,00:26:25,"And then Joan Plarrite is in there, who--"
00:26:25,00:26:27,"I don't know if you know who that is, but I mean,"
00:26:27,00:26:28,she's 85 years old.
00:26:28,00:26:30,She is a kind of famous stage actress.
00:26:30,00:26:33,She's often in things like Inspector Morse playing
00:26:33,00:26:35,a servant woman.
00:26:35,00:26:37,But does she have a really nice eyes?
00:26:37,00:26:38,"I looked really hard, and to be honest,"
00:26:38,00:26:42,I found it hard to see what they're talking about.
00:26:42,00:26:43,Everyone's got nice eyes.
00:26:43,00:26:45,"I mean, just eyes are nice, aren't they?"
00:26:45,00:26:46,Yeah.
00:26:46,00:26:47,How long?
00:26:47,00:26:48,OK.
00:26:48,00:26:50,"You know, you can say someone's got nice hair"
00:26:50,00:26:54,"or not very nice hair, but eyes are just nice to look at."
00:26:54,00:26:56,Everyone likes looking at a knife.
00:26:56,00:26:58,I've seen some bad eyes.
00:26:58,00:26:59,Have you?
00:26:59,00:27:01,There were some really bad eyes.
00:27:01,00:27:03,I have a couple of facts about eyes if you want them.
00:27:03,00:27:04,"Yeah, fact number one, eyes are lovely."
00:27:04,00:27:13,"Fact number two, the first person known to have had blue eyes"
00:27:13,00:27:14,was we know who it was.
00:27:14,00:27:16,"So it was 7,000 years ago."
00:27:16,00:27:19,"It was a caveman living in Spain, because it's a mutation."
00:27:19,00:27:22,So everyone who's got blue eyes can trace the ancestry back
00:27:22,00:27:24,to that particular individual.
00:27:24,00:27:26,I wonder if everyone just went to that cave
00:27:26,00:27:30,"and then went, you have beautiful eyes."
00:27:30,00:27:33,"And then Andy went, everyone has a beautiful eyes."
00:27:33,00:27:36,"OK, it's time for our final fact of the show."
00:27:36,00:27:38,And that is Chosinski.
00:27:38,00:27:43,"Yes, my fact is that the word fascinate literally"
00:27:43,00:27:47,means the embodiment of the divine fallace.
00:27:47,00:27:49,Certainly the sense in which I use it all the time.
00:27:49,00:27:54,So this is the etymology of fascinate.
00:27:54,00:27:56,"It comes from the Latin word fascinum, which"
00:27:56,00:28:00,"was either fascinus the phallic god, which we know very little"
00:28:00,00:28:05,"about, or it was a phallic object that you carry around"
00:28:05,00:28:07,"for good luck, which they did a lot of the time."
00:28:07,00:28:09,I just like to ward off the evil eye or something like that.
00:28:09,00:28:10,"Yeah, exactly."
00:28:10,00:28:13,So the verb fascinari in Latin was
00:28:13,00:28:17,to use the power of the phallus to either ward off the evil eye
00:28:17,00:28:19,or to hypnotize someone in an evil manner.
00:28:19,00:28:21,"So if you're fascinating somebody,"
00:28:21,00:28:24,you are using the power of the phallus.
00:28:24,00:28:26,And what would a cast a spell on them?
00:28:26,00:28:28,This is what Dan was doing at that award ceremony.
00:28:28,00:28:30,Yeah.
00:28:30,00:28:32,So I spent most of today googling penises
00:28:32,00:28:33,of fascinating.
00:28:33,00:28:38,And it's a lot out there.
00:28:38,00:28:39,All penises are beautiful.
00:28:39,00:28:48,"Well, back in back May last year, James"
00:28:48,00:28:52,and I were in the office alone together.
00:28:52,00:28:54,And we kind of ran out of conversation.
00:28:54,00:28:57,And this is kind of--
00:28:57,00:29:00,"This is really not the time, not the place for this."
00:29:00,00:29:02,People need to know.
00:29:02,00:29:04,So we kind of just ran out of conversation.
00:29:04,00:29:07,"And James, just in a way to sort of just spark up conversation,"
00:29:07,00:29:09,"just looked up to me and said, hey, do you know that there"
00:29:09,00:29:13,was over 600 guys in the world with two dicks?
00:29:13,00:29:15,"And as if that was like, oh, good, we're back in."
00:29:15,00:29:17,We have a conversation going on.
00:29:17,00:29:18,And I googled it.
00:29:18,00:29:22,And there were 600 men in the world who have two penises.
00:29:22,00:29:24,"And on Reddit, there's a website Reddit."
00:29:24,00:29:26,"They have that thing, AMA."
00:29:26,00:29:28,And AMA asked me anything.
00:29:28,00:29:29,One of the most successful things I ever had
00:29:29,00:29:32,"was someone coming on saying, I have two penises."
00:29:32,00:29:33,Ask me anything.
00:29:33,00:29:35,It was what bit where it an interview was talking about.
00:29:35,00:29:38,"It says, the most upsetting moment for him"
00:29:38,00:29:39,was a girl he dated.
00:29:39,00:29:43,"Seriously, he got-- he was over one night stands."
00:29:43,00:29:44,And they dated for three months.
00:29:44,00:29:45,They were just kissing and cuddling.
00:29:45,00:29:47,She finally was ready.
00:29:47,00:29:49,I'd put it off for another month after that.
00:29:49,00:29:51,"But when it came down to it, I told her"
00:29:51,00:29:54,that I was built different from other guys.
00:29:54,00:29:56,So I was sort of slightly built different.
00:29:56,00:29:58,She said she didn't care.
00:29:58,00:29:59,I revealed them to her.
00:29:59,00:30:01,And she said she definitely cared.
00:30:01,00:30:04,[LAUGHTER]
00:30:04,00:30:08,Only she had known that all penises are beautiful.
00:30:08,00:30:11,There was a guy that used to freak shows
00:30:11,00:30:12,in the 19th century.
00:30:12,00:30:14,And there was one guy called--
00:30:14,00:30:17,I think he's called like Dos Santos or something like that.
00:30:17,00:30:20,And he was known as the man with two swords.
00:30:20,00:30:23,And he used to show himself off as a man with two penises.
00:30:23,00:30:27,And he married a woman called Blanche Duma
00:30:27,00:30:28,or something like that.
00:30:28,00:30:29,She called two scabbards or something.
00:30:29,00:30:37,[LAUGHTER]
00:30:37,00:30:39,"No, she-- but she did have two vaginas, yeah."
00:30:39,00:30:41,What?
00:30:41,00:30:44,There's someone out there for everybody.
00:30:44,00:30:47,"OK, this was a fact about etymology."
00:30:47,00:30:48,"Oh, yeah."
00:30:48,00:30:49,"Sorry, sorry."
00:30:49,00:30:51,"Yeah, back to Roman penises, at least,"
00:30:51,00:30:53,"because that's more highbrow, I think."
00:30:53,00:30:55,They were more highbrow then.
00:30:55,00:30:59,"So the age of nine days, Roman boys"
00:30:59,00:31:02,would be given an amulet with a phallus inside it.
00:31:02,00:31:05,And that was to ward off the evil eye.
00:31:05,00:31:06,That was the point of it.
00:31:06,00:31:07,And they'd have to go around wearing this amulet
00:31:07,00:31:10,with a phallus inside it until they came of age.
00:31:10,00:31:12,Because they weren't really-- they weren't as obscene
00:31:12,00:31:13,"as they are now, although they weren't seen as being obscene,"
00:31:13,00:31:15,because of this old good luck thing.
00:31:15,00:31:17,"Yeah, and also getting rid of this evil eye,"
00:31:17,00:31:20,it was really thought to be a really serious thing.
00:31:20,00:31:23,There's a Roman mosaic of a phallus ejaculating
00:31:23,00:31:26,into a disembodied eye.
00:31:26,00:31:29,Wikipedia described it as a relief.
00:31:29,00:31:38,So have you seen the relief?
00:31:38,00:31:39,I've seen it.
00:31:39,00:31:41,So it's pretty--
00:31:41,00:31:41,It's so weird.
00:31:41,00:31:44,"The phallus has its own penis, which"
00:31:44,00:31:45,is doing the ejaculating.
00:31:45,00:31:49,"So it's a lovely stone-carved relief, as James says."
00:31:49,00:31:50,And I think it's in Turkey.
00:31:50,00:31:53,And it's a phallus with back legs.
00:31:53,00:31:56,And then there's a smaller penis coming down from it.
00:31:56,00:31:58,And it's shooting ejaculating into an eye
00:31:58,00:31:59,with a scorpion on top of it.
00:31:59,00:32:00,Amazing.
00:32:00,00:32:02,I like the penis with the little penis.
00:32:02,00:32:04,It's like that village in Gloucestershire.
00:32:04,00:32:07,Yes.
00:32:07,00:32:11,"I mean, not exactly like that."
00:32:11,00:32:14,"Roman prostitutes sold things called colifio,"
00:32:14,00:32:17,which were little bread rolls shaped like penises.
00:32:17,00:32:17,That's a bay.
00:32:17,00:32:18,Yeah.
00:32:18,00:32:21,"And you don't get that in Gregg's, do you?"
00:32:21,00:32:27,It was a clarify that Gregg's is not
00:32:27,00:32:30,a staffed excuse me if I prostitutes.
00:32:30,00:32:35,"Yes, I would like to try."
00:32:35,00:32:38,That's why you keep getting injected from Gregg's James.
00:32:38,00:32:43,So there's a theory that the reason we don't know very much
00:32:43,00:32:47,about fascinus is that Christians tried
00:32:47,00:32:49,to eradicate from our collective memory
00:32:49,00:32:51,"all the weird stuff that the Romans were interested in,"
00:32:51,00:32:52,"like this, because they thought it was a bit"
00:32:52,00:32:53,prudish.
00:32:53,00:32:55,But there's another god called--
00:32:55,00:32:57,has a really good name-- called Moutunus Tutunus.
00:32:57,00:32:58,And he--
00:32:58,00:33:01,[LAUGHTER]
00:33:01,00:33:03,Sorry.
00:33:03,00:33:05,"I was midship, and then it was the best day"
00:33:05,00:33:06,by the way.
00:33:06,00:33:07,"Yeah, yeah."
00:33:07,00:33:08,What was that?
00:33:08,00:33:10,Moutunus Tutunus.
00:33:10,00:33:13,"Mouti Tutu, and nobody ever called him."
00:33:13,00:33:16,And he was sort of a god of fertility.
00:33:16,00:33:20,And so there was a tradition in which there would be sculptures
00:33:20,00:33:23,"of Moutunus Tutunus, and he had a large phallus,"
00:33:23,00:33:25,because that was what he represented.
00:33:25,00:33:28,And it has been written that Roman brides
00:33:28,00:33:31,to prepare themselves for marriage
00:33:31,00:33:34,would have to straddle the phallus of Moutunus
00:33:34,00:33:37,to prepare themselves for the upcoming intercourse.
00:33:37,00:33:38,He was a dildo.
00:33:38,00:33:40,[LAUGHTER]
00:33:40,00:33:44,"Mouti Tutu, the first dildo."
00:33:44,00:33:50,"If that's not in the goodie bags at next year's Oscar's eye,"
00:33:50,00:33:51,you're going to turn down your award.
00:33:51,00:33:56,This person is called Faskinus.
00:33:56,00:34:00,"And another word that comes from this guy, whose name"
00:34:00,00:34:06,"means penis, is fascist, because originally"
00:34:06,00:34:10,"it came from Fasky Sicilianie de Levittori,"
00:34:10,00:34:13,and the word Fasky came from meaning a group.
00:34:13,00:34:15,"And that originally was like a bundle,"
00:34:15,00:34:17,but it also had the same kind of connotations
00:34:17,00:34:19,as something large and whatever.
00:34:19,00:34:21,And that was where the word fascist came from.
00:34:21,00:34:23,"What Faskers rods of office, literally,"
00:34:23,00:34:27,that Roman officials carried to show their authority?
00:34:27,00:34:29,"So basically, all fascists are dicks."
00:34:29,00:34:33,[LAUGHTER]
00:34:33,00:34:36,"If I were you, the rest, you didn't really get into that way."
00:34:36,00:34:39,Audience fascists here tonight.
00:34:39,00:34:41,I feel like I'm going to be making a lot of spaghetti this evening.
00:34:41,00:34:46,[LAUGHTER]
00:34:46,00:34:51,"I read, I discovered a new martial art discipline today."
00:34:51,00:34:54,It's called 99 Power Chi Gong.
00:34:54,00:34:55,So it's part of Chi Gong.
00:34:55,00:34:59,"It's one of the rarer, practiced bits of Chi Gong and martial"
00:34:59,00:35:00,arts.
00:35:00,00:35:02,Its other name is Iron Crotch.
00:35:02,00:35:04,"Men of a certain age, suddenly need"
00:35:04,00:35:07,to start attaching lots of really heavy things to the dick
00:35:07,00:35:11,and allow it to just get some exercise.
00:35:11,00:35:12,I think that's the kind of thing.
00:35:12,00:35:14,There's a guy called Master 2.
00:35:14,00:35:16,"He goes around the world, teaching people how to do this."
00:35:16,00:35:18,He's described on his website as a graceful man
00:35:18,00:35:21,who moves like a swimming dragon with sudden bursts
00:35:21,00:35:22,of thunderous gestures.
00:35:22,00:35:24,But what he's mainly known for is that he
00:35:24,00:35:26,can tow trucks with his penis.
00:35:26,00:35:28,What's wrong with a tow rope?
00:35:28,00:35:30,[LAUGHTER]
00:35:30,00:35:33,"Well, I'm just only mentioning it in case anyone's"
00:35:33,00:35:35,"looking for an interesting Christmas gift to give the someone,"
00:35:35,00:35:38,"because you can buy Iron Crotch the DVD, which is,"
00:35:38,00:35:41,like those exercise DVDs that you get.
00:35:41,00:35:46,And it comes with a rope and a hook to hook.
00:35:46,00:35:47,And you'll be able to find that.
00:35:47,00:35:48,I know such thing as a fish.com.
00:35:48,00:35:53,"This Christmas, along with your motunus to tunus still though."
00:35:53,00:35:58,And a free copy of Jurassic Shark.
00:35:58,00:35:59,"OK, I'm going to have to stop us there."
00:35:59,00:36:00,"OK, that's it."
