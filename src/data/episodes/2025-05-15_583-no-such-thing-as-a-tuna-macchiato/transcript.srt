1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,400
 - Hi, everybody.

2
00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:03,320
 Before we start the show, I just wanted to let you know

3
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:06,000
 I'm joined by a very exciting guest right now.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,640
 It is a world acclaimed author, Andrew Hunter Murray.

5
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:10,480
 Hello, Andrew.

6
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:11,320
 - Hello.

7
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:12,560
 - You've written a book right here.

8
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:13,880
 - Yes, I've written a book.

9
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:15,640
 It's called "A Beginner's Guide to Breaking and Entering."

10
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:17,840
 It's out in paperback now.

11
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:19,260
 - Yes, I've actually read it.

12
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:20,760
 And not even just 'cause I'm friends with him

13
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:23,440
 because it's such a fun read.

14
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:27,400
 And it's actually not a guide to how to break into a house

15
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:29,600
 and burgle it, which is obviously what I was hoping for.

16
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:31,440
 - It's even better than that.

17
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:32,680
 Tell us about it.

18
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:35,120
 - Well, it's about a young guy called Al

19
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:38,080
 who lives in lovely, empty second homes

20
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:40,040
 when the real life owners are away.

21
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:42,120
 He doesn't break things, he doesn't steal things.

22
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:43,440
 He just makes his way in,

23
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,880
 lives in these gorgeous places, and then gets out again.

24
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:48,720
 And this book is the story of when he and his friends

25
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:51,080
 break into the wrong home on the wrong day,

26
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:53,480
 someone ends up dead, not his fault,

27
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:55,640
 and things just get more complicated from there.

28
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:56,600
 It's a caper.

29
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:58,760
 - It is a plus, a little bit of satire

30
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:00,840
 in the housing market, which every good book needs.

31
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:03,600
 And obviously he joins up with a fun motley crew

32
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:04,920
 of fellow breakers and enterers.

33
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:07,440
 It really is such a fun book to read.

34
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:10,840
 And I believe it's available in bookshops, is that right?

35
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:12,160
 - It's available in all bookshops.

36
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:14,440
 And even better, if you're an audio person,

37
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:17,160
 it's in a two for one deal on Audible.

38
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:18,680
 That and one of my other books the last day

39
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:20,920
 are both included in the current Audible deal,

40
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:22,920
 which is lasting a few more days

41
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:25,120
 where you can get two books for one credit.

42
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:28,660
 - Do it, go, listen to the book and then read the book.

43
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:30,720
 - Do both, it really is worth it.

44
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:33,280
 And speaking of guests, we had a fantastic guest on today.

45
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:35,640
 We had so much fun with her in the episode

46
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:36,560
 that you're about to hear.

47
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:39,400
 It was the excellent comedian Rosie Holt,

48
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:42,200
 who I'm sure many of you are familiar with.

49
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:44,640
 And once you've listened to this, if you're in the market

50
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,760
 for some very sharp skewering of what's going on

51
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:50,480
 in politics today, you have to check out her podcast,

52
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:52,880
 which is called Non-Censored.

53
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,320
 On the other hand, if what you fancy

54
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:57,560
 is a very witty satire on the last government,

55
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:00,720
 then check out her book, which is called Why We Were Right.

56
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:03,340
 So that is Non-Censored, the podcast,

57
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:05,700
 or Why We Were Right, the book.

58
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:07,940
 But for now, enjoy the show.

59
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:09,300
 - On with the podcast.

60
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:11,720
 (jazz music)

61
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:15,140
 (jazz music)

62
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:27,060
 - Hello and welcome to another episode

63
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:29,760
 of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast

64
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,520
 coming to you from the QI offices in Hoburn.

65
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,560
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

66
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:35,760
 I am sitting here with Anna Tyshinski,

67
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:38,040
 Andrew Hunter Murray, and Rosie Holt.

68
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:40,080
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones

69
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,440
 with our favorite facts from the last seven days.

70
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:45,320
 And in no particular order, here we go.

71
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:48,880
 Starting with fact number one, and that is Rosie.

72
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:51,960
 - My fact this week is all the werewolves

73
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:54,940
 in the film Howling 2 are actually monkeys

74
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:57,440
 because the wrong costumes were delivered.

75
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,560
 (laughing)

76
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:01,360
 - So, so much to unpack here.

77
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,920
 You said Howling 2, like every listener's gonna know.

78
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:07,240
 - Everyone knows about the famous film Howling 2.

79
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:10,560
 I think somewhere Howling 2 was called

80
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,320
 the worst sequel of all time.

81
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:14,040
 (laughing)

82
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:16,120
 - Those people clearly never saw Howling 8.

83
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:18,720
 (laughing)

84
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:21,400
 - And you're a fan, right Rosie?

85
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:24,400
 - Sort of, I'm fascinated by it.

86
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,300
 So, I don't wanna spoil too much for people

87
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:30,420
 who are really excited about watching Howling 2,

88
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:32,440
 but it leaves off where Howling 1

89
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:35,500
 (laughing)

90
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:38,700
 finishes, where spoiler alert,

91
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:42,260
 the female lead turns into a werewolf and she is killed.

92
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:45,260
 And at the beginning of Howling 2, it's her funeral.

93
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:49,180
 And the best line ever is where Christopher Liu

94
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:50,780
 pops up, 'cause why not?

95
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:54,980
 And he says, he says, I'm afraid your sister was a werewolf.

96
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:56,460
 And the guy goes, God damn it,

97
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:58,680
 that's my sister you're talking about.

98
00:03:58,680 --> 00:03:59,520
 (laughing)

99
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,360
 - And he says it at the funeral.

100
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,200
 - Yes.

101
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,020
 - And he turns over to the funeral,

102
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:02,860
 no one knows who he is.

103
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:03,700
 He's just a weird guy.

104
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:04,540
 - Just a weird old guy.

105
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:05,700
 - He stands at the back and then says that.

106
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:07,380
 And you can understand, we haven't led up to,

107
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:09,100
 like, did you know there are more things on earth

108
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:11,900
 than a dreamt of, you know, like the werewolves exist.

109
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:14,220
 As far as I can tell, this is fresh news for this guy.

110
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:15,060
 - No, it's a cold open.

111
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:17,540
 - I must say, 'cause I think I might be the person on the planet

112
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:19,820
 who's watched Howling 2 most recently.

113
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:22,220
 - I finished one hour ago and then I came straight

114
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:23,060
 directly here.

115
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:24,660
 (laughing)

116
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:26,260
 And it's really good.

117
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:27,940
 - Watching it with the knowledge of what happened

118
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:29,420
 with these costumes, it was a mix-up.

119
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:31,460
 They were Planet of the Apes TV series.

120
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:33,020
 - Oh yeah, that's the costume story.

121
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:35,900
 - Yeah, so basically, they were sent the costumes.

122
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:36,740
 The costumes were late.

123
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:38,780
 When they opened the costumes,

124
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:41,980
 it was actually from the Planet of the Apes TV show.

125
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:44,900
 And then, good old Christopher Lee saved the day

126
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:48,100
 because he said, this is what we're going to do, Philippe,

127
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:49,380
 that's the director.

128
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:51,900
 We're going to shoot a scene where we simply explain

129
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:54,460
 that werewolves go through three phases,

130
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:58,180
 a human phase, a monkey phase, and then a werewolf phase.

131
00:04:58,180 --> 00:04:59,420
 And that will solve everything.

132
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:00,260
 - No.

133
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:01,420
 - And it did. - And it did.

134
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:02,260
 - Yes. - Yeah.

135
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:03,300
 - And that's what they do. - Yeah.

136
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:04,140
 - Pretty much.

137
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:05,220
 - So do they look like monkeys?

138
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:06,060
 - They look exactly like monkeys.

139
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:08,220
 - They look exactly like monkeys from Planet of the Apes.

140
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:09,060
 (laughing)

141
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:10,180
 - It's really confusing.

142
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:12,500
 And they shot it all in the dark.

143
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:14,700
 And then later on, once they got a werewolf head,

144
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:17,220
 they spliced in lots of shots of a random werewolf head

145
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:18,060
 crossing a screen.

146
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:19,060
 It's terrific.

147
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:20,020
 It's so good.

148
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:21,740
 I mean, there's so much in this film.

149
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:22,580
 - Yes.

150
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:23,740
 And there's lots of great little facts.

151
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:24,980
 So the other thing about the costumes

152
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:28,380
 was there's a threesome scene where they're all werewolves

153
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:30,420
 and they're all having sexy fun.

154
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:32,220
 But if you probably remember, Andrew.

155
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:33,340
 - I remember the scene very well.

156
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:34,180
 - Yes.

157
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:37,540
 It's not a terribly, I mean, vigorous threesome.

158
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:40,540
 They're sort of tentatively stroking each other

159
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:42,620
 and growling, and it's because,

160
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:46,340
 so they'd had to be covered in hair for the costumes.

161
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:48,060
 And this took, I think this took like eight hours.

162
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:51,780
 And then they found out that when you touched each other,

163
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:53,060
 the hair came off.

164
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:53,900
 - Yeah.

165
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:55,620
 - So therefore they were having to not touch each other

166
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:58,460
 because they realized if they actually did an orgy,

167
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:01,660
 well, a film orgy, all their costumes would fall off.

168
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:03,340
 - 'Cause it wasn't a costume.

169
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:06,860
 It was them naked for eight hours with them putting

170
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:08,180
 little bits of hair on them.

171
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:09,020
 - Oh, was it them naked?

172
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:09,860
 Like, yeah.

173
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:10,780
 - Sorry, I didn't explain that very well.

174
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:12,140
 It would have made more sense to put them

175
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:13,220
 in the monkey costumes for this.

176
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:15,260
 But I guess they thought because they're sort of naked,

177
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:16,340
 it's still going to be sexy-ish.

178
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:17,940
 - It's not quite as sexy as the monkey costume.

179
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:18,780
 - Yeah.

180
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:19,980
 - It's the hairiest and most chased three

181
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:20,820
 some ever committed.

182
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:22,540
 - It's a rare double award.

183
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:25,180
 Rosie, is this one of your favorite films or something?

184
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:26,380
 - It's not one of my favorite films,

185
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:29,020
 but I do have a real soft spot for it.

186
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:30,220
 - 'Cause it's genuinely so bad it's good.

187
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:31,260
 - It is so bad it's good.

188
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:32,380
 - After the first 10 minutes, I thought,

189
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:33,940
 I hope, I can't believe we're going to cover this

190
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:34,980
 in case someone watches it.

191
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:36,660
 And now, I say watch it.

192
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:37,500
 - Yeah.

193
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:38,340
 Do you totally?

194
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:39,860
 - I mean, it has, the weird thing about Christopher Lee

195
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:42,780
 is that he's a good actor who's only done shit films

196
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:44,420
 with a few exceptions, obviously.

197
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:46,220
 - Lord of the Rings, Man with the Golden Gun,

198
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:47,820
 The Wicker Man, one of the greatest horror films

199
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:49,540
 I've ever made.

200
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:50,660
 - So he's done some good films,

201
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:53,140
 but he's done a lot of really bad films.

202
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:54,540
 - I think the only reason he did this movie

203
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:56,900
 was 'cause he realized he hadn't done a werewolf movie.

204
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:57,740
 So he thought, okay.

205
00:06:57,740 --> 00:06:58,580
 - And thought, this is the one.

206
00:06:58,580 --> 00:06:59,980
 - This is the one, howling two.

207
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:01,180
 - This is the one.

208
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:03,500
 - The filming of this one sounds amazing.

209
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:05,180
 'Cause Christopher Lee, we must have mentioned before,

210
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:06,700
 is like an amazing character.

211
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:10,540
 He had this great war past where he worked for the SOE,

212
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:12,380
 the special operations executive in the war,

213
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:15,620
 which was like the secret service under Churchill.

214
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:17,300
 No one really knows what he did there

215
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:19,100
 'cause he was never allowed to talk about it.

216
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:22,340
 But it seems like the one person he confided in

217
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:23,980
 was the director of this film,

218
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:25,380
 who was called Philippe Mora.

219
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:27,700
 - Yeah, 'cause he was a Nazi hunter.

220
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:28,700
 - Yes.

221
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:31,460
 - But apparently they landed in Czechoslovakia,

222
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:34,820
 which it was at the time, where it was being filmed.

223
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:36,860
 And they got to the airport

224
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:39,260
 and there was this huge crowd of people

225
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:40,860
 who were all like cheering and waving

226
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:42,540
 and giving this heroes welcome.

227
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:43,380
 - Wait, hang on.

228
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:44,220
 - Yeah, go on.

229
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:45,060
 - Quick query.

230
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:45,900
 - Go.

231
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:48,940
 - He was a super secret war hero and Nazi hunter.

232
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:51,460
 And yet he's so globally famous as a Nazi hunter

233
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:53,220
 that everyone in the Czech Republic

234
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:54,780
 knows who he is at the airport.

235
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:56,020
 - He must have been like James Bond,

236
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:57,500
 where he just didn't hide.

237
00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:00,620
 - Is that totally plausible?

238
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:03,820
 - No, no, there were elements of his war past

239
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:04,900
 that were known at that point.

240
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:06,340
 'Cause it was the 80s by then.

241
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:09,820
 And basically it seemed to be widely accepted

242
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:12,020
 that as part of his spying war history,

243
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:15,380
 he'd been involved in the assassination of Reinhard Heidrich,

244
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:18,820
 who was the highest ranking Nazi ever,

245
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:20,980
 assassinated by the West.

246
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:23,780
 So he landed in Prague and he got this heroes welcome.

247
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:25,540
 And the director was like, one, do that's for one.

248
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:27,780
 Christopher Lee was like, I'm gonna stop you there.

249
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:28,860
 It'll be for me.

250
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:31,740
 - For my Nazi killing.

251
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:34,460
 - I have seen a couple of stories saying

252
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:36,540
 did he exaggerate his war record at all?

253
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:38,380
 And I haven't had the time to properly look into them.

254
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:39,380
 And I just hope he didn't.

255
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:40,540
 - I didn't want to be scared to do that.

256
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:42,260
 - If he got such a heroes welcome,

257
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:44,820
 surely he didn't exaggerate any of it.

258
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:45,660
 - Yeah, but it could have been--

259
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:48,100
 - He was also a globally favoured film star at the time.

260
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:49,820
 They might be showing any old stuff.

261
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:51,420
 - I don't think that's relevant.

262
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:52,740
 I don't think that's what to do with it.

263
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:53,820
 - The checks are above that.

264
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:56,740
 - But because it was filmed in Czechsvakia,

265
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:59,380
 Christopher Lee and Sibyl Daning, was it Sibyl Danning?

266
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:00,220
 - Yeah.

267
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:02,380
 - Yeah, they both were getting followed the whole time

268
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:05,180
 while they were shooting by two creepy men

269
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:06,220
 who would sit in the corner

270
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:07,980
 when they ate in the restaurant in the evening.

271
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:09,900
 - As in like Iron Curtain's bunnies or secret police?

272
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:11,780
 - Yes, Iron Curtain's smiles.

273
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:13,620
 - Oh, Iron Curtain's smiles.

274
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:14,460
 'Cause they did, yeah, they did.

275
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:16,420
 They were making phone calls back home

276
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:18,740
 and they could hear them in the background,

277
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:20,140
 just like men breathing and coughing

278
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:22,180
 as they were listening in on the conversations.

279
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:23,020
 - It's worth it, guys.

280
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:24,260
 Were they that the Soviet Union had?

281
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:25,180
 No wonder it fell apart.

282
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:27,020
 If it didn't have its shit together to stay quiet

283
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:28,380
 on a phone call, it was just listening.

284
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:29,980
 - I think they're using the Christopher Lee,

285
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:33,140
 tell you I'm a Nazi murderer process.

286
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:33,980
 They don't care.

287
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:37,860
 - The lead actress is Sibyl Danning, as you just said.

288
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:38,700
 There is a bit of the film,

289
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:41,140
 a slightly sexy bit where she rips her shirt off.

290
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:44,220
 It's a very charged scene, you know?

291
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:46,140
 But she apparently had been asked to do this

292
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:48,540
 in lots of films because she was very attractive

293
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:49,460
 and she was a bit bored of it.

294
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:50,300
 And she said, "Do you know what?

295
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:53,420
 I think I'd like to do just one topless scene

296
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:55,660
 or even one topless shot entirely in this film.

297
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:56,500
 Is that okay?"

298
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:58,500
 And the actress said, "Yeah, great, great, great."

299
00:09:58,500 --> 00:09:59,340
 Anyway, she turns out--

300
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:00,500
 - So she said, "I want to be limited to one."

301
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:03,260
 - Yes, she just wants to do this once, which happened.

302
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:04,620
 She then turns up to the premiere of the film

303
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:06,700
 where the credits, the closing sequence of the credits

304
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:09,460
 uses that shot a further 17 times

305
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:11,500
 for absolutely no reason.

306
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:14,380
 - Yeah, it just has, on repeat, like exposing her chest.

307
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:15,700
 - No.

308
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:16,820
 - Wow.

309
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:18,700
 - Like a sort of sexy gift.

310
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:22,100
 - If you give them an inch, they will take a month off.

311
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:24,900
 - But it's so Mora, the director, back to him for a second,

312
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:26,740
 he didn't know they were going to do that

313
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:28,700
 to Danning, the actress.

314
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:29,540
 So he actually--

315
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:30,780
 - Because they were friends, weren't they?

316
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:31,620
 - They were friends.

317
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:34,020
 And he kind of, at the end of the movie,

318
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:36,620
 they brought in some other people to do a final edit on it.

319
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:39,060
 And part of that edit was throwing in 17 shots

320
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:41,140
 of her topless during the credit sequence.

321
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:42,580
 And he was really pissed off by that.

322
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:44,100
 So he then goes on, he says,

323
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:47,060
 "I want to make Howling 3 because I want to fix

324
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:49,340
 "the reputation of what this did."

325
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:50,660
 - Because of that credit sequence.

326
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:51,500
 - Well, he was just pissed off.

327
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,300
 - The whole film, I think.

328
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:55,580
 A lot of rehab work on your career.

329
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:57,540
 I don't think the credit sequence is the main problem.

330
00:10:57,540 --> 00:10:59,540
 It's problematic, but it's, woof.

331
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:03,060
 - Yeah, so Howling 3 sounds amazing.

332
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:05,420
 Howling 3, the marsupials.

333
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:09,620
 This then is set in Australia, has no reoccurring characters,

334
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:12,460
 has no plot that is connected to anything else.

335
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:15,900
 In it, the humans that are transformed into the Howling

336
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:17,700
 have pouches like marsupials.

337
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:18,820
 - Amazing.

338
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:20,460
 - Yeah, it sounds pretty amazing.

339
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:22,900
 He generally just in praise of Mora,

340
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:24,300
 'cause he's an Aussie film director,

341
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:25,460
 and I'd never heard of him.

342
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:28,380
 But his list of movies is extraordinary.

343
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:30,580
 I'm really obsessed with a movie that he directed

344
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:33,740
 called "Teridactile Women" from Beverly Hills.

345
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:34,980
 - Wow. - I know, right?

346
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:36,620
 So listen to the plot.

347
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:39,660
 Paleontologist Dick Chandler discovers a dinosaur egg

348
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:42,860
 prompting an eccentric witch doctor named Salvador Dali

349
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:44,780
 to put a curse on Chandler's wife, Pixie,

350
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:48,020
 causing her to slowly transform into a pterodactyl.

351
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:49,660
 After Pixie lays an egg,

352
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:52,060
 Dick tracks down Salvador Dali and apologizes,

353
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:53,300
 and the curse is lifted.

354
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:54,500
 (laughing)

355
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:56,980
 Now, Barry Humphries is in this movie.

356
00:11:56,980 --> 00:11:58,900
 It's like a proper movie.

357
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:00,580
 I can't wait to see that.

358
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:01,420
 - Barry Humphries.

359
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:03,220
 - Barry Humphries is in it.

360
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:06,740
 There's a bit where Christopher Lee says in "Howling 2,"

361
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:08,980
 right, there are some sort of King werewolves

362
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:11,780
 and Queen werewolves, they cannot be killed with silver.

363
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:13,900
 This is like, there's an oh no moment, oh no,

364
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:14,740
 what are we gonna do?

365
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:17,460
 They just says they can be killed with titanium,

366
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:19,980
 which, although a slightly harder method to get hold of,

367
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:21,940
 was very much easily available at the time.

368
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:23,780
 (laughing)

369
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:24,820
 It's stunning.

370
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:27,900
 - Is that a copyright thing with Bran Stoker's people?

371
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:29,300
 - I have no idea.

372
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:31,060
 - I read an interview with the director,

373
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:35,180
 and he was really so, 'cause it got so panned,

374
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:37,780
 and he's so enthusiastic about it,

375
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:39,140
 and everything he got asked, he'd go,

376
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:41,260
 "Thank you for asking that."

377
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:43,020
 And one of the things he said, which I liked,

378
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:45,220
 was in the poster, there's Sibyl Danning,

379
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:47,500
 she's wearing these sunglasses,

380
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,220
 which will obviously appear in the movie,

381
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:51,860
 and that came about 'cause he said that she came along

382
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:53,580
 and she had conjunctivitis, and they were like,

383
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:55,020
 "What, what were we doing?"

384
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:57,380
 He was like, "Don't worry, you're a werewolf,

385
00:12:57,380 --> 00:13:00,220
 and a werewolf can wear sunglasses indoors

386
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:01,420
 if they want to."

387
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:02,260
 (laughing)

388
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:06,020
 - And that's what your identity is like the concealed now.

389
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:08,140
 - I read that somewhere that that became

390
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:10,420
 very influential in the movie industry.

391
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:12,060
 So if you think of the Lost Boys,

392
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:13,420
 the vampire movies and so on,

393
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:14,380
 they're all wearing glasses,

394
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:16,300
 and according to numerous people,

395
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:17,700
 that was a direct influence.

396
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:19,180
 It suddenly was cool to do it.

397
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:21,980
 - It's hard to imagine this film had any influence.

398
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:23,100
 (laughing)

399
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:24,860
 - I think it might have been the '80s.

400
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:27,300
 Christopher Lee's in it, it was a proper release.

401
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:29,020
 It's part of a massive franchise.

402
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:29,860
 - Yeah.

403
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:32,460
 - I was just looking at monkey costumes.

404
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:33,300
 - Oh yeah.

405
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:36,420
 - And the gorilla movies used to be a really big thing

406
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:37,980
 in the '20s and '30s.

407
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:40,460
 They were a cultural preoccupation.

408
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:41,300
 I suppose they are now.

409
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:42,260
 - Why? - Actually, Kong.

410
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:43,100
 - Anything else?

411
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:44,340
 - It's all leading up to King Kong.

412
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:45,980
 Basically, they started with normal-sized gorillas,

413
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:49,100
 and then they worked their way up to Kong.

414
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:50,380
 But we still have loads of Kong stuff now,

415
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:51,580
 and we're still having plenty of the games.

416
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:54,700
 So this is a permanent societal thing.

417
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:56,900
 But there was one guy called Charles Gamora,

418
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:59,220
 who was known as the King of the Gorilla Men

419
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:00,740
 in the '20s and '30s,

420
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:02,620
 partly because he had his own suit.

421
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:03,860
 (laughing)

422
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:06,700
 So any film that needed a gorilla,

423
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:08,740
 get Charles Gamora on set now.

424
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:11,020
 And he'd done a bit of, he'd seen,

425
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:13,020
 he was very convincing in his suit.

426
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:14,740
 And he was the right sort of height,

427
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:16,900
 and he looked into the San Diego Zoo

428
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:17,940
 and sort of observed them.

429
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:19,380
 And so he was trying to do it properly,

430
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:20,780
 he was trying to go in method.

431
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:23,820
 Anyway, in 30 years, he was in 43 films,

432
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:26,180
 39 of which involved him being a gorilla.

433
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:27,020
 - Right.

434
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:28,460
 - The others, he played two aliens,

435
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:30,180
 one bear and one cannibal.

436
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:31,860
 - Same suit with bits sewn onto it.

437
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:32,700
 - Same suit.

438
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:33,540
 - Oh, I don't know.

439
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:34,620
 (laughing)

440
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:35,460
 - It just sounds great.

441
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:36,740
 He's the one called the Monster and the Girl,

442
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:39,460
 where a gorilla receives the brain of a man

443
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:40,620
 who is seeking revenge

444
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:42,220
 because he was wrongfully executed.

445
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:43,060
 - Right.

446
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:43,900
 - Yeah.

447
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:45,260
 - The brain goes into the gorilla.

448
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:46,100
 - That's really good.

449
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:48,380
 - I mean, I really hope Modern Hollywood

450
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:51,300
 is still using the, well, he's got a suit.

451
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:52,860
 (laughing)

452
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:55,540
 - Andy Serkis just has a great costume like that.

453
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:58,020
 - Well, that's how Downey Jr. got Iron Man.

454
00:14:58,020 --> 00:14:58,760
 (laughing)

455
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:01,340
 (upbeat music)

456
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:05,380
 - Okay, it is time for fact number two,

457
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:06,700
 and that is my fact.

458
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:09,020
 My fact this week is that the author,

459
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:12,740
 Elizabeth Gaskell, died in the middle of saying,

460
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:16,740
 "When I am dead, but only got as far as when..."

461
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:18,540
 (laughing)

462
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:20,180
 - So, how do people know?

463
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:21,780
 (laughing)

464
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:23,300
 - This is really interesting.

465
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:24,940
 She, we should just say very quickly

466
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:27,860
 before we get into it, this is Elizabeth Gaskell,

467
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:29,900
 Mrs. Gaskell, as she was often known.

468
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:31,020
 She was an English novelist.

469
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:32,180
 She wrote short stories.

470
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:34,620
 She was a biographer, most famously having written a book

471
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:36,060
 about Charlotte Bronte.

472
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:36,900
 Maybe we'll get onto that.

473
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:37,940
 - Although that's certainly not like, you know,

474
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:39,020
 she's most famously wrote.

475
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:39,860
 - Yes, it really works in fiction.

476
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:41,420
 - Yes, Mary Barton.

477
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:43,900
 - Yes, she was one of our great Victorian novelists.

478
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:46,500
 - But at the time, she was most famous

479
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:47,340
 for writing biography.

480
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:49,100
 - Her obituary basically said,

481
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:50,700
 "Charlotte Bronte's biographer dead."

482
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:51,540
 - Yes.

483
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:52,380
 - When?

484
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:53,620
 - When, exactly.

485
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:57,460
 - So, what happened was, this is 1865.

486
00:15:57,460 --> 00:15:58,980
 She is 55 years old.

487
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:01,700
 She's at her home, which is a sort of secret home

488
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:02,820
 that she's purchased.

489
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:04,860
 - Yeah, I feel like we'll go into that as that story.

490
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:08,980
 - I'm just leaving some little plot moments as we go along.

491
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:11,100
 So, she's at her house.

492
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:12,340
 She's sitting with her daughters

493
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:14,820
 and suddenly she keels over and she dies,

494
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:16,740
 but she dies mid-anichthote.

495
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:18,220
 And we know what happened

496
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:20,580
 because of a reverend called Reverend Hawkes,

497
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:23,180
 who recounted the story, as was told to him

498
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:24,500
 by one of the daughters.

499
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:26,660
 So, she was with her daughters and her son-in-law.

500
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:28,780
 She was telling a story and she says,

501
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:30,740
 "The judge said when,"

502
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:32,780
 and then that's when she passed away.

503
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:34,260
 Now, she was telling an anecdote.

504
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:35,900
 Fortunately, one of the four people there

505
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:37,700
 had already heard this anecdote,

506
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:39,100
 presumably so many times

507
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:41,500
 that they knew exactly what was coming next.

508
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,380
 And the line that was meant to come next

509
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:45,620
 was, "The judge said, 'When I'm dead,

510
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:47,940
 'Lady Crompton can visit Rome.'"

511
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:49,860
 A classic line.

512
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:51,580
 - Yes, classic line.

513
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:53,500
 - Everybody laughed.

514
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:57,060
 I think you can see where she was going in the conversation

515
00:16:57,060 --> 00:16:58,900
 because a little bit of backstory is

516
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:02,420
 that Justice Crompton had just died.

517
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:04,380
 He was her son-in-law's dad

518
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:05,820
 and I think her son-in-law's present.

519
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:08,020
 So, the guy she's talking about

520
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:09,780
 is the person who said, "When I am dead."

521
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:11,780
 So, I imagine she was going on to say,

522
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:15,900
 "So now, lucky lady Crompton can book her flight to Rome."

523
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:17,380
 Because, you know, it was relevant.

524
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:18,540
 It's funny 'cause he is dead,

525
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:20,220
 so it's got a bit of gallows humor to it.

526
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:22,940
 - You've sort of solved the end of the anecdote.

527
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:24,020
 - I think that's what's happened.

528
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:26,900
 Yeah, it's like Edwin Drude has finally been revealed.

529
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:27,900
 - Thank God.

530
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:32,060
 How great, though, to sort of not be lost on that last word.

531
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:34,260
 Like, we should all practice our final words

532
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:35,900
 with someone in confidence beforehand

533
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:37,740
 so that if we do go mid-sentence,

534
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:39,340
 I mean, I will be saying something

535
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:41,140
 I've already said loads of times already

536
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:44,620
 'cause I'm down to a limited stock of anecdotes now.

537
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:45,820
 Just people know my things.

538
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:47,180
 - Do you think it was a bit of a let down, though,

539
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:49,340
 when they said, "Well, she started by saying

540
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:51,300
 "wet," and then someone went, "No, no, actually,

541
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:53,580
 "she's told that several times before."

542
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:56,060
 - A bit of a bore, actually, Lizzie.

543
00:17:56,060 --> 00:17:57,780
 - Always whining about the same stuff.

544
00:17:57,780 --> 00:17:58,820
 That's probably why old people

545
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:00,500
 repeat anecdotes all the time, isn't it?

546
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:02,780
 Just to make sure that once they're saying their anecdote,

547
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:04,300
 that we know where they were going with it.

548
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:06,020
 - Very wise, yeah. - Yeah, that's very wise.

549
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:07,700
 - She's, has anyone read this?

550
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:09,180
 - I've read Mary Barton.

551
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:10,020
 Thank you.

552
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:11,180
 - You've read North and South.

553
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:12,020
 - Thank you.

554
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:13,140
 - I think I've read North and South.

555
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:13,980
 Or Mary Barton.

556
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:15,660
 - Or have you just seen the TV series?

557
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:17,060
 - No, I'm gonna be a little bit heretical.

558
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:18,460
 I don't think she's all that.

559
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:20,020
 I mean, she's good.

560
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:22,180
 They're good novels, but they're very Victorian.

561
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:24,140
 They're a bit, you know, they haven't aged brilliantly.

562
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:25,780
 - I think they've got, I think they really have.

563
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:27,820
 I think she's much more radical than people.

564
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:29,700
 - Yes, that's what I don't like, yeah, yeah.

565
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:33,380
 - Mary Barton, it's a sort of a working class character,

566
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:34,500
 and it's very much in that life,

567
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:38,220
 which was, you know, not so much the dumb thing back then.

568
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:39,500
 - I completely agree.

569
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:42,700
 I think, like, her and Dickens are two people

570
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:44,140
 who really engage with people

571
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:46,740
 who are having a shit old time in life,

572
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:48,900
 more than almost any other Victorian novelist, you know,

573
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:51,140
 'cause they're all about factory workers,

574
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:55,180
 the strife between bosses and laborers.

575
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:56,380
 Not into that though, are you, Andy?

576
00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:57,700
 - I like reading about aristocrats

577
00:18:57,700 --> 00:18:59,420
 with minor social problems.

578
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:00,340
 (all laughing)

579
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:02,060
 That's my thing.

580
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:03,740
 - 'Cause she did write about that stuff.

581
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:04,980
 It was really controversial, wasn't it?

582
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:07,380
 And in her community as well, particularly,

583
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:09,060
 where she was representing these characters,

584
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:12,340
 'cause I believe I actually haven't read any of her stuff,

585
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:15,180
 but it sounds as if the other writers of the time

586
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:16,540
 who were in the same field,

587
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:19,220
 so Bronte, a friend of hers, Austin,

588
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:21,580
 they would write about a period slightly gone,

589
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:23,580
 whereas she was writing in the present,

590
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:25,460
 and then that, so that was a bit more controversial.

591
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:26,300
 And there's a few books.

592
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:27,500
 She had one book called "Ruth,"

593
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,060
 which was very controversial,

594
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:32,020
 and they actually burnt copies in her local church.

595
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:33,180
 - Yes, members of her own church.

596
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:34,180
 - Yeah, which is. - Which is.

597
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:35,260
 - Why did they do that?

598
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:36,660
 - 'Cause it was debauched.

599
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:38,020
 - It's about a fallen woman.

600
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:39,660
 - Oh, yes, they should be about.

601
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:42,380
 - I know how it's a threesome scene actually.

602
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:44,260
 Wolfs dressed as gorillas.

603
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:46,660
 - That's what fallen women do, yes.

604
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:48,900
 - Gascall wasn't allowed into her husband's library.

605
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:50,940
 He had to get books out for her.

606
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:52,140
 It's very weird.

607
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:52,980
 - Really? - Yeah.

608
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:54,300
 - Local library, not like his personal.

609
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:56,820
 Like, no, not his, she was allowed,

610
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:59,020
 she was allowed the run of the house at home,

611
00:19:59,020 --> 00:19:59,860
 but no, he was a member of the library.

612
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:01,980
 - She wasn't allowed his library, like Bluebeard.

613
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:02,820
 - What's that?

614
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:04,500
 - You know the tell of Bluebeard,

615
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,380
 where he marries this young woman,

616
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:08,780
 and he says, "You can go in any room you like,

617
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:10,860
 "except for this one."

618
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:12,300
 - You're talking about Beauty and the Beast.

619
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:14,180
 - No, I'm not talking about Bluebeard.

620
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:15,260
 - Are you talking about the pirate?

621
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:16,100
 - What's in the room?

622
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:16,940
 - No, everybody.

623
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:17,780
 - Kurt Vonnegut novel?

624
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:20,700
 - No, it's a very famous tale that none of you have heard of.

625
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:21,540
 - I think I know what's in the room,

626
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:23,660
 but you say it, you say it, what's in the room?

627
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:26,580
 - So she finally, 'cause he keeps going away,

628
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:28,300
 so she's wandering around all these rooms,

629
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:29,900
 and she gets impatient.

630
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:32,860
 She goes, "I just want to know what's in the mystery room."

631
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:34,300
 So she uses the skeleton key.

632
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:36,700
 I think it's the skeleton key, maybe I've embellished that.

633
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:38,300
 And she opens it,

634
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:41,740
 and inside are all the dead bodies of his previous wife.

635
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:42,580
 - Oh!

636
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:47,260
 - Don't draw attention to it, you idiot man.

637
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:48,340
 But then he comes back, and he goes,

638
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:51,460
 "Oh dear, looks like I'm gonna have to kill you too,

639
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:52,700
 "because you opened the door."

640
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:54,100
 - Another notch in the skeleton key.

641
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:56,580
 - Yes, and the other notch is going to escape.

642
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:58,140
 - Yes, it's a funny old story, isn't it?

643
00:20:58,140 --> 00:20:59,420
 - Where's it from?

644
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:00,780
 - Is it an author we know?

645
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:02,100
 Is it almost like a photo?

646
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:05,100
 - No, it's very old, it's a very old tale.

647
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:06,540
 - Right, I can't.

648
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:08,540
 - That wasn't the case in Gaskell's husband's library,

649
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:09,380
 as far as I know.

650
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:11,620
 - Well, you don't know, because no one went in there.

651
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:12,980
 - That's true.

652
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:13,820
 - But the thing about her,

653
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:16,180
 I think which kind of annoys people or bores at them,

654
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:18,020
 is that she actually was really normal.

655
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:18,980
 And the thing that's quite nice about her

656
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:20,820
 is that she just basically had a really happy life.

657
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:23,700
 She was quite conventional in how she lived, you know?

658
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:24,860
 She married this vicar.

659
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:26,580
 - Wait, or was she?

660
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:30,020
 - Or what, do you know the hidden history of her orgies?

661
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:31,420
 (laughing)

662
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:32,660
 The mass orgies.

663
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:35,900
 - Well, wasn't there a rumour going round when she died

664
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:38,740
 that she and her husband were separated?

665
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:41,060
 And that's why she was in the separate house.

666
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:44,020
 - Well, I do think that that's got weight.

667
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:46,300
 So I'm glad other people who aren't gossips like me

668
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:48,220
 have said it, because I'm not a gossip.

669
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:51,140
 - I only bring the fat, you're an intellectual.

670
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:54,020
 - So separate house, she bought her own house.

671
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:55,740
 - The house she dies in, yes.

672
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:57,140
 - Without telling her husband.

673
00:21:57,140 --> 00:21:59,980
 - And the story is that it was a surprise for her husband,

674
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:01,500
 like a retirement home.

675
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:02,860
 Oh, we're going to move to the country,

676
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:04,740
 this lovely mansion, and she was in the house

677
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:05,940
 with all her daughters saying,

678
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:07,940
 isn't daddy going to be delighted?

679
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:08,780
 But I agree it's a bit--

680
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:09,940
 - So all the children are there as well?

681
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:12,980
 - Yeah, I mean, which is why slightly the story suggests

682
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:14,380
 that that is what was going on.

683
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:17,340
 But is he at home at the breakfast table at the house?

684
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:19,860
 Well, I think it's very quiet this morning, isn't it?

685
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:21,660
 - God, they're sleeping in today.

686
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:23,700
 I bet they were separated.

687
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:24,540
 - Okay, do you reckon?

688
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:25,860
 - Yeah, I think so.

689
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:28,740
 - Or it was a secret death house.

690
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:30,220
 Sorry.

691
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:32,500
 She thought my time is up.

692
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:36,740
 I like how animals like to go and die under a log

693
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:37,580
 or something.

694
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:39,180
 She thought I'm going to die in a house

695
00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:42,380
 that's a huge faff to buy a full house, isn't it?

696
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:43,460
 - Yeah, but houses are cheaper then.

697
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:46,100
 I think it was probably easier to do.

698
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:49,100
 A few years ago, a university got a collection of letters

699
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:50,740
 that were written by someone who was friends

700
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:52,900
 with Elizabeth Gaskell and they were having correspondence

701
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:56,260
 and in it, Gaskell predicted her death that year.

702
00:22:56,260 --> 00:22:57,500
 She said to her, I'm not going to make it

703
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:58,340
 to the end of the year.

704
00:22:58,340 --> 00:22:59,900
 - So I'd better buy a house.

705
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:02,540
 - Yeah, but perhaps she didn't know

706
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:04,500
 that she was doing so well.

707
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:05,460
 She could sense it.

708
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:08,020
 - There is an argument in Gaskell's life.

709
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:09,900
 So the house, the secret house that she bought

710
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:13,100
 was in Alton, in Hampshire, which is where--

711
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:14,780
 - Jane Austen lived, yeah.

712
00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:16,580
 - For the last years of her life.

713
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:17,860
 - And Alton Towers, is that there?

714
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:18,940
 - No, it's in a completely different place.

715
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:20,580
 It's hundreds of miles away.

716
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:24,500
 But Gaskell grew up in Stratford-upon-Avon,

717
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:25,780
 home of--

718
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:27,100
 - Shakespeare.

719
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:28,660
 - So is this a lay line?

720
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:30,060
 - You guys weren't quick enough.

721
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:31,820
 (laughing)

722
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:33,460
 - So is this an argument for lay lines

723
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:35,220
 in terms of literary creativity, probably?

724
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:36,740
 - There's certainly something going on, isn't there?

725
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:38,460
 - Yeah, certainly, I think.

726
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:40,620
 Do you know she gave us the word "squiffy" to mean drunk?

727
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:41,460
 - Really?

728
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:42,300
 - Oh, brilliant.

729
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:44,100
 I know, I love that fact.

730
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:45,740
 - I love the sound of her, I have to say.

731
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:48,020
 As in, when you read about her social life,

732
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:50,300
 there is this comparison, I think, with Dickens,

733
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:52,960
 where Dickens was partying all the time.

734
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:53,860
 He was everywhere.

735
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:55,300
 He went around the world.

736
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:56,700
 That's exactly what Gaskell did

737
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:58,020
 in a time where it felt like

738
00:23:58,020 --> 00:23:59,180
 that would have been much harder.

739
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:01,100
 She was a mother of how many children

740
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:01,940
 did she have in total?

741
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:02,780
 - Five.

742
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:03,620
 - I think she was pregnant seven times.

743
00:24:03,620 --> 00:24:04,620
 A couple of the children didn't live.

744
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:05,580
 - Okay, right.

745
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:07,460
 Five daughters and one son, yeah, survived,

746
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:08,300
 which is quite a lot.

747
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:09,140
 - That is, yeah.

748
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:11,660
 She was writing, she wrote quite a few novels,

749
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:13,500
 a lot of short stories, a biography.

750
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:14,860
 She traveled the world.

751
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:17,060
 She was constantly said to be dancing

752
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:18,140
 half the night at parties.

753
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:19,740
 She was a real socialite.

754
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:21,020
 I think she sounds really fun.

755
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:22,820
 - I think you would have gotten along with her very well.

756
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:24,340
 - Yeah, it feels like it. - It was a real butterfly.

757
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:26,220
 - She even wrote one of her novels

758
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:27,940
 while she was staying with Florence Nightingale.

759
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:30,580
 Like, she just touches all these little elements

760
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:32,540
 of the past, which I really love.

761
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:34,080
 - She sounds like someone who deserves

762
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:35,580
 to have been let in the library.

763
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:36,420
 - Yeah. - Yeah.

764
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:37,260
 - I don't know though.

765
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:38,100
 - I know.

766
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:38,940
 - It's a slippery slope, isn't it?

767
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:41,660
 - I think she should have been allowed in that library.

768
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:43,700
 - You let them in libraries one day, you know, the next day.

769
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:45,100
 - They just go in there willy-nilly.

770
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:45,940
 - Yeah, exactly.

771
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:47,020
 - It's like getting squiffy.

772
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:49,380
 - I have another theory about her

773
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:51,340
 that I think we should spread this gossip.

774
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:53,900
 Her brother, John, and have you read about him?

775
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:55,900
 He was seven years older than her.

776
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:57,900
 So she had, her mom died when she was one

777
00:24:57,900 --> 00:24:59,940
 and she was sent to live with an aunt who she loved

778
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:02,540
 and she lived in this very female dominated community.

779
00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:03,740
 It was all women.

780
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:05,240
 But she did have this older brother

781
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:06,880
 who still lived with her dad and they wrote

782
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:09,480
 to each other a lot and he was really fond of her.

783
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:11,400
 And then he joined the merchant navy

784
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:13,320
 and they kept writing to each other.

785
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:15,320
 And then he just vanishes.

786
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:17,720
 And everyone says he was either abducted by pirates

787
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:20,280
 in India or his ship sank.

788
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:23,360
 But she, after writing the years, she's 17.

789
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:24,200
 - Yeah.

790
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:26,700
 (laughing)

791
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:28,640
 - Bluebeard, yes, kidnapped.

792
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:31,920
 - A bluebeard and a blackbeard, brothers or friends,

793
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:33,280
 they must know each other.

794
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:35,020
 - They're naughty cousins.

795
00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:37,260
 (laughing)

796
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:41,620
 - So, yes, it's vicious.

797
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:42,460
 And she never mentioned it.

798
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:45,260
 She never mentioned him to her kids except to say,

799
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:46,800
 "Oh, I don't really remember him."

800
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:47,640
 - Really?

801
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:48,460
 - Of course you'd remember him.

802
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:49,620
 - Too painful or?

803
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:50,460
 - Well, I don't know.

804
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:51,300
 - What's your theory?

805
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:53,060
 You seem to be driving at something here, Anna.

806
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:53,900
 - I think-

807
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:54,900
 - Is he in the library?

808
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:58,180
 - I think his corpse was on the shelves.

809
00:25:58,180 --> 00:26:00,460
 I think maybe he ran away with like an Indian lady

810
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:03,360
 and told only her and she can never tell anyone.

811
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:04,400
 - That's a good theory.

812
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:05,240
 - Yeah, I like that.

813
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:07,880
 - Just on people who wrote anonymously.

814
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:11,520
 'Cause Gaskell was always, by a lady,

815
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:13,320
 would appear on her title pages.

816
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:15,360
 I think she was Mrs. Gaskell later in her career.

817
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:18,200
 But I didn't really realize how common this was.

818
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:22,720
 So between 1750 and 1790, 80% of all novels

819
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:25,360
 did not list an author on the title page.

820
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:28,080
 Male and female writers, it just wasn't a thing.

821
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:31,060
 For women, it was because it was a bit risqué

822
00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:31,900
 to be writing a novel.

823
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:33,600
 It was too similar to prostitution,

824
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:36,820
 which I mean, that's genuinely the theory I wrote.

825
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:38,900
 But by a lady was a good phrase to use

826
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:40,700
 because it showed that the author

827
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:42,740
 was someone of a decent class.

828
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:45,240
 So Jane Austen was by a lady

829
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:47,100
 and then later on by the same lady

830
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:49,060
 who brought you sense and sensibility.

831
00:26:49,060 --> 00:26:50,700
 I was genuinely at that.

832
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:53,820
 And she never saw her own name on a title page, Jane Austen.

833
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:54,760
 She's kind of tragic.

834
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:56,100
 - Yeah, it's sad.

835
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:57,140
 Do you think other books at the time

836
00:26:57,140 --> 00:26:59,040
 were written by a different lady?

837
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:00,800
 (all laughing)

838
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:01,700
 - Not that lady.

839
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:03,320
 I can't believe it's not a lady.

840
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:04,800
 Yeah.

841
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:07,600
 But all of it, like Tristan Shandy, Byron stuff,

842
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:09,260
 Jonathan Swift, it's all anonymous.

843
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:10,760
 - Really? - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

844
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:12,280
 - 'Cause the novel was quite new then, wasn't it?

845
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:13,280
 Maybe it was still a bit like,

846
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:15,400
 oh, this might not go down very well in history.

847
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:16,560
 - It was risqué, definitely.

848
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:18,160
 And it was quite fun as well.

849
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:20,320
 So Jonathan Swift, he sent his stuff

850
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:22,240
 to a publisher via someone else.

851
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,640
 So there was no way of tracing it back to him.

852
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,040
 - Really? - Yeah, yeah.

853
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:27,180
 - And then when the printer said,

854
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:29,180
 "Look, who is the author of 'Gulliver's Travels'?"

855
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:30,940
 Swift and his friend, Alexander Pope,

856
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:33,220
 they pretended, "I don't know, I don't know who wrote this."

857
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:35,100
 They would even write letters to each other privately,

858
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:37,780
 saying, "Who wrote this 'Gulliver's Travels' book?"

859
00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:39,380
 Completely between themselves.

860
00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:41,100
 - Yeah. - "I don't know.

861
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:42,420
 It's so funny."

862
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:43,860
 They just, it was a bit of a game, you know?

863
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:45,620
 - But was there a royalty thing

864
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:47,620
 that they would still have in place?

865
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:49,780
 - Yeah, I guess you could be paid anonymously

866
00:27:49,780 --> 00:27:50,980
 quite easily at the time.

867
00:27:50,980 --> 00:27:53,820
 - There's just one person who's called like Anna Lady,

868
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:57,600
 who's just funneling all the money accidentally sent out.

869
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,860
 (laughing)

870
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:02,960
 - Gaskell obviously gave all her money to her husband

871
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:05,360
 at first, and in fact, I think it went to him automatically

872
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:07,880
 'cause married women weren't allowed to earn money.

873
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:10,160
 - You really don't approve of this husband, I tell you.

874
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:12,120
 He came from his library.

875
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:15,280
 - Apparently it was very affectionate.

876
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:17,340
 I was listening to a--

877
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:19,120
 - And that's why she bought a secret house.

878
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:20,320
 (laughing)

879
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:21,760
 - I think it was a little joke.

880
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,320
 He was the one who suggested she write

881
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:25,660
 to get over the death of her one-year-old son

882
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:27,520
 who very sadly died, and he said,

883
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:29,780
 "As to help you with grieving, write a novel."

884
00:28:29,780 --> 00:28:31,060
 Probably not suspecting she was gonna become

885
00:28:31,060 --> 00:28:32,700
 a world famous novelist.

886
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:35,060
 And yes, when she got paid, it went straight to him,

887
00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:37,380
 and he sort of jokely pocketed it saying,

888
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:39,180
 "Well, you know, women shouldn't be earning

889
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:41,060
 "or in control of the purse strings, should they?

890
00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:42,820
 "I'll give you some pocket money."

891
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:44,540
 But I think it was all meant--

892
00:28:44,540 --> 00:28:45,380
 - Was he saying that?

893
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:46,700
 - All meant to Jess, too.

894
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:48,540
 It was all meant to Jess.

895
00:28:48,540 --> 00:28:49,380
 - It was a different time.

896
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:51,580
 It's so hard to know when it's written, isn't it?

897
00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:52,860
 You didn't know the tone.

898
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:55,320
 - Yeah, they needed more emojis, I think.

899
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:57,560
 (laughing)

900
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:59,160
 - How much of history would be different

901
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:00,400
 if emojis existed?

902
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:02,320
 (laughing)

903
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:03,520
 - I have nothing to offer but blood,

904
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:04,720
 toil, tears, and sweat.

905
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:05,560
 Winky.

906
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:07,400
 (laughing)

907
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:09,980
 (upbeat music)

908
00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:14,080
 - Okay, it is time for fact number three,

909
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:15,720
 and that is Anna.

910
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:18,720
 - My fact this week is that one of Ovid's tips

911
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,920
 for seducing a woman you fancied

912
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:23,700
 was to pretend you'd seen dust on her cleavage

913
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:25,380
 and then go to brush it off.

914
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:26,940
 - It's a great line, isn't it?

915
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:29,100
 Oh, you've got a very dusty cleavage.

916
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:29,940
 (laughing)

917
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:31,140
 It's what every woman wants to hear.

918
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:31,980
 - Yeah.

919
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:34,160
 - Anna, when you say go to brush it off,

920
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:35,780
 follow through and actually brush it off?

921
00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:36,620
 - Follow through, yes.

922
00:29:36,620 --> 00:29:38,380
 So these were his exact words.

923
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:39,220
 - Follow.

924
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:41,140
 - Go to and then complete the brush.

925
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:41,980
 - Complete.

926
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:44,100
 - Do you think it's like an updated thing of the,

927
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:46,200
 no, sorry, a down-dated thing?

928
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:47,540
 (laughing)

929
00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:49,420
 Because now it's, if you've got an eyelash,

930
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:51,440
 oh, you've got an eyelash on your cheek, isn't it?

931
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:54,000
 And then the man like removes the eyelash.

932
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,720
 - You know this man, come on.

933
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:57,200
 - I have a pocket full of eyelashes

934
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:59,680
 that I try and subtly sprinkle onto people's cheeks.

935
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:00,520
 - Yeah, that's true.

936
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:01,600
 - Yeah, yeah.

937
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:03,840
 - Absolute classic, absolute classic.

938
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:04,680
 - Have you had that tried on you?

939
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:05,520
 Is that, does it work?

940
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:07,340
 - Oh, you've got an eyelash on your...

941
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:08,680
 (laughing)

942
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:10,800
 And then they lift it off your face.

943
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:12,480
 - What harm is that eyelash doing there?

944
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,240
 - And then they go take a, make a wish.

945
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:15,240
 So maybe it's the same.

946
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:17,480
 It was like, take you, you've got some dust

947
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:18,520
 on your cleavage.

948
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:21,320
 And then they hold it out going, make a wish.

949
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:23,580
 - Blow on it like a dandelion.

950
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:26,500
 I think this book of ours might contain a lot of things

951
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:27,620
 that you guys could try out.

952
00:30:27,620 --> 00:30:29,220
 And I'd love to hear the results.

953
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:31,300
 So this is a book called "Ars Amatoria"

954
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:33,880
 and Ovid was a Roman writer.

955
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:36,640
 He wrote this in year two AD.

956
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:37,480
 - And it got in early.

957
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:38,320
 - Box fresh.

958
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:42,220
 - It got in early, so couple of millennia ago.

959
00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:44,780
 His exact words were, as often happens,

960
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:47,020
 if perchance, a little dust should fall

961
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:48,340
 on the bosom of the fair,

962
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:50,600
 it must be brushed off with your fingers.

963
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:52,800
 And if there should be no dust,

964
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:55,020
 still brush off that none.

965
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:57,820
 - It would work for me.

966
00:30:57,820 --> 00:30:59,520
 (laughing)

967
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:01,040
 I'd like it.

968
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:03,920
 - He has so much good stuff in there.

969
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:05,880
 Oh, he also said, "Let it be your object

970
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:08,940
 to please the husband of the fair one that you fancy."

971
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:10,160
 I suppose we're assuming.

972
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:12,240
 - Oh, this is naughty.

973
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:13,520
 - Because once made a friend,

974
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:16,040
 he will be more serviceable for your designs.

975
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:19,020
 So I think you'll get invitations to the house

976
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:20,500
 a little bit more.

977
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:23,100
 - Not like come in and have a hairy threesome.

978
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:23,940
 - No.

979
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:25,000
 - No, he did specify that.

980
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,900
 (laughing)

981
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:30,660
 - Specify no bad gorilla costumes and no threesome.

982
00:31:30,660 --> 00:31:34,820
 - I mean, he was a very risque writer at the time.

983
00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:36,860
 He was, what's the word?

984
00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:39,340
 He was not evicted, he was deported.

985
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:40,180
 - Yeah.

986
00:31:40,180 --> 00:31:41,020
 - He was banned.

987
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:41,860
 - Exiled.

988
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:44,780
 - Exiled to the worst place in the world at the time.

989
00:31:44,780 --> 00:31:47,360
 He claimed seems to have been a completely normal city

990
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:48,320
 in modern day Romania,

991
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:50,880
 but compared with Rome, I guess it was rubbish.

992
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:51,720
 - Okay.

993
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:53,360
 - And for the last 10 years of his life,

994
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:55,520
 he spent there writing the "Tristii",

995
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:58,120
 which were basically sad letters saying,

996
00:31:58,120 --> 00:31:59,800
 "Please can I come back to Rome?"

997
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:02,080
 To everyone he knew in Rome, including the emperor.

998
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:03,600
 But I think he was evicted because he was,

999
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:04,440
 he was quite a libidness,

1000
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:05,800
 quite a licentious writer,

1001
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:07,760
 lots of sexy stuff in the Ars Amatoria,

1002
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,240
 lots of love poetry,

1003
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:12,000
 but it's quite mysterious why he was actually kicked out.

1004
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:12,840
 - Yeah, we don't know.

1005
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:14,160
 - No one knows for sure.

1006
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:15,660
 - There might have been a scandal

1007
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:18,140
 involving the daughter of the emperor, Augustus.

1008
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:19,380
 - Yeah, Junior.

1009
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:20,700
 I think maybe it was the scandal.

1010
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:22,700
 - It might have been a general back-to-basics campaign

1011
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:23,700
 that Augustus was running,

1012
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:25,860
 'cause Rome was getting a little bit CD

1013
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:27,220
 and Augustus didn't really like that.

1014
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:28,900
 And he was trying to raise public morals a bit

1015
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:30,580
 and Ovid was stood out there saying,

1016
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:32,460
 "Get Dustin", you know, all of that.

1017
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:34,220
 So it's really unclear why he was.

1018
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:35,220
 - Get Dustin.

1019
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:36,660
 (all laughing)

1020
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:37,500
 - Bang!

1021
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:41,020
 - Man for some Dustin, these ladies.

1022
00:32:41,020 --> 00:32:43,860
 - So there were three volumes of this book, right?

1023
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:45,840
 The Art of Love, first one, which teaches the reader

1024
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:47,240
 how to seduce a woman.

1025
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:50,040
 The second one then is, okay, okay, you've got her.

1026
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:52,720
 Now, how do you continue to seduce her?

1027
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:53,840
 Which is very interesting.

1028
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:56,680
 And then the third one is how for women,

1029
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:57,860
 so there must have been feedback going,

1030
00:32:57,860 --> 00:32:59,880
 "Hey, this is all very man-based.

1031
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:01,120
 Can we get the opposite version?"

1032
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:03,960
 So he wrote, "How a woman can seduce a man."

1033
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:06,320
 But the fourth volume, which is a separate book,

1034
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:07,400
 is the most exciting one.

1035
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:08,560
 - The Marsupials.

1036
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:09,400
 - Yeah, lover.

1037
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:10,240
 (all laughing)

1038
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:12,280
 - Develop a pouch in your front.

1039
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:13,840
 (all laughing)

1040
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:16,020
 - Remedia Amoris.

1041
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:19,220
 This is the book of how if it's unrequited love,

1042
00:33:19,220 --> 00:33:20,940
 do you stop loving a person?

1043
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:23,020
 What a great idea for a book.

1044
00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:24,020
 - It's a terrific sequel.

1045
00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:24,860
 - It's fantastic.

1046
00:33:24,860 --> 00:33:26,980
 - The publishers must have been absolutely chuffed.

1047
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:28,980
 It's got great advice in it as well, the Remedia.

1048
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:30,860
 There's, "Join the Army."

1049
00:33:30,860 --> 00:33:31,940
 - Oh, boom.

1050
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:33,340
 - Become a lawyer.

1051
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:34,900
 Become a farmer.

1052
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:35,980
 Get a hobby.

1053
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:38,740
 - How is this supposed to get you out of unrequited love?

1054
00:33:38,740 --> 00:33:40,460
 - I think it's when your heart broken,

1055
00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:41,380
 it's how to get over it.

1056
00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:42,220
 - It's distraction.

1057
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:45,320
 - It's not like my dad gave me some advice

1058
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:46,160
 once when I was a teenager

1059
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:48,420
 and I was very heartbroken over a boy

1060
00:33:48,420 --> 00:33:49,920
 who did not love me back.

1061
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:54,740
 And my dad said, "Just picture him on the loo."

1062
00:33:54,740 --> 00:33:55,580
 - Oh, wow.

1063
00:33:55,580 --> 00:33:56,420
 - Really?

1064
00:33:56,420 --> 00:33:57,680
 - I can see that going in there.

1065
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:59,460
 - Well, there is a similar-ish thing.

1066
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:00,300
 - Yeah, it is.

1067
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:01,140
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1068
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:02,140
 Did it work?

1069
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:03,840
 - No, and I said to Dad,

1070
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:07,520
 'cause he said, "I was in love with Sarah."

1071
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:08,360
 I can't remember her's name.

1072
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:10,340
 There's a girl he was in love with when he was a teenager.

1073
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:11,180
 And he said, "And I..."

1074
00:34:11,180 --> 00:34:12,020
 - I'm gonna shout at her right now.

1075
00:34:12,020 --> 00:34:13,840
 (all laughing)

1076
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:15,780
 - Cleveland, Sarah Cleveland.

1077
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:16,620
 - Oh, thank God, great.

1078
00:34:16,620 --> 00:34:17,880
 Now we're legally secure, yeah.

1079
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:19,380
 - So I was in love with Sarah Cleveland

1080
00:34:19,380 --> 00:34:22,420
 and I would picture her on the loo to get me over her.

1081
00:34:22,420 --> 00:34:23,260
 And I said, "Did it work?"

1082
00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:24,580
 And he went, "No."

1083
00:34:24,580 --> 00:34:25,420
 - Right.

1084
00:34:25,420 --> 00:34:26,900
 - If anything, I developed a weird fetish

1085
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:28,940
 that has dawned my life ever since.

1086
00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:30,300
 (all laughing)

1087
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:32,580
 - Well, okay, well, Ovid wrote,

1088
00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:35,340
 "Maybe this would have worked alternatively."

1089
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:36,780
 And this is about if you're a man

1090
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:38,780
 and you had your heart broken by a woman,

1091
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:41,140
 go and see her unannounced, right?

1092
00:34:41,140 --> 00:34:41,980
 - Early in the morning.

1093
00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:42,980
 - When she hasn't got her makeup on.

1094
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:44,340
 - When she hasn't got her makeup on.

1095
00:34:44,340 --> 00:34:45,180
 And you'll be reminded.

1096
00:34:45,180 --> 00:34:46,020
 - She's got two.

1097
00:34:46,020 --> 00:34:46,860
 (all laughing)

1098
00:34:46,860 --> 00:34:49,180
 - She does, don't I claim it?

1099
00:34:49,180 --> 00:34:51,100
 - They need a broom to get that out of love.

1100
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:52,740
 (all laughing)

1101
00:34:52,740 --> 00:34:56,820
 - Yeah, he also, the classic kind of like teenage movie

1102
00:34:56,820 --> 00:34:59,660
 techniques burn all the items that are associated with them.

1103
00:34:59,660 --> 00:35:01,940
 So sit with a fire and throw the letters in,

1104
00:35:01,940 --> 00:35:04,100
 the love letters and the bits of clothing

1105
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:06,300
 or whatever's been left over in your house.

1106
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:08,300
 Do that and, but what a great book.

1107
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:10,340
 What a forward thinking book.

1108
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:12,780
 - He had to, yes, there are some ropey bits of it.

1109
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:14,780
 Maybe it doesn't stand up to a lot of feminism,

1110
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:16,620
 but he was a very pro makeup, actually.

1111
00:35:16,620 --> 00:35:19,380
 He wrote a whole separate book on why women

1112
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:21,940
 should wear makeup because there was a lot of pushback

1113
00:35:21,940 --> 00:35:24,420
 in society at the time about how women were

1114
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:26,500
 overdressing their faces with makeup.

1115
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:27,900
 - Augustus, back to basics.

1116
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:29,340
 Let's take off that thick slap.

1117
00:35:29,340 --> 00:35:30,180
 - Exactly.

1118
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:31,020
 - And just have natural beauty.

1119
00:35:31,020 --> 00:35:31,860
 - Exactly.

1120
00:35:31,860 --> 00:35:34,220
 - And he was like, "No, natural beauty."

1121
00:35:34,220 --> 00:35:37,540
 - Yeah, no, have you seen their natural faces underneath?

1122
00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:39,660
 And that's also a good read.

1123
00:35:39,660 --> 00:35:41,580
 - Lots of slap, dusty bosoms.

1124
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:44,180
 (all laughing)

1125
00:35:44,180 --> 00:35:49,980
 - He gets quoted a lot as a kind of proto pickup artist.

1126
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:50,820
 - Yeah.

1127
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:53,700
 - And there was a brief trend when that sort of--

1128
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:55,060
 - Neil Strauss, the game.

1129
00:35:55,060 --> 00:35:57,620
 - Sort of grim thing of pickup artistry was doing a thing.

1130
00:35:57,620 --> 00:36:00,500
 A lot of like proto bros were saying,

1131
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:01,940
 "You can't read Ovid."

1132
00:36:01,940 --> 00:36:03,700
 In much the same way that they were all saying,

1133
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:06,700
 "You've got to read Sun Tzu's, The Art of War."

1134
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:07,540
 - Are you reading that?

1135
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:08,540
 Are you really?

1136
00:36:08,540 --> 00:36:09,860
 - Are you actually reading Marx or really,

1137
00:36:09,860 --> 00:36:11,380
 it says meditations, are you?

1138
00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:12,660
 - It did actually really remind me of that.

1139
00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:14,020
 I didn't realise people are connected to those.

1140
00:36:14,020 --> 00:36:16,220
 It reminded me of that game mentality.

1141
00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:18,660
 But a lot of his advice is quite sort of modern,

1142
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:23,140
 like when he says how you should befriend the lady's maid.

1143
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:23,980
 - Yes.

1144
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:25,700
 - And that's how to get in there.

1145
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:26,740
 - Yes, very clever.

1146
00:36:26,740 --> 00:36:28,100
 - So it is a bit like that, yeah.

1147
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:28,940
 I mean, he's--

1148
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:30,660
 - How would he do that with a friend who's a lady's maid?

1149
00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:32,460
 What kind of life do you need for a gig?

1150
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:34,140
 (all laughing)

1151
00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:34,980
 - So modern.

1152
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:35,980
 - That is what you do.

1153
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:38,260
 (all laughing)

1154
00:36:38,260 --> 00:36:39,620
 - But one of the people who's written loads about this

1155
00:36:39,620 --> 00:36:42,380
 is a woman called Donna Zuckerberg, who is a classicist.

1156
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:45,140
 And she's written a book called Classics Beyond the Manosphere,

1157
00:36:45,140 --> 00:36:46,180
 all about this.

1158
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:48,100
 And she is an interesting person.

1159
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:49,820
 She's the only Zuckerberg sibling

1160
00:36:49,820 --> 00:36:52,300
 not to have become a tech titan.

1161
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:53,140
 - Wow.

1162
00:36:53,140 --> 00:36:54,620
 - Yeah, she's a sister of Mark

1163
00:36:54,620 --> 00:36:56,300
 and there are four, I think four Zuckerbergs.

1164
00:36:56,300 --> 00:36:57,900
 And yeah.

1165
00:36:57,900 --> 00:37:00,020
 - Well, she, yeah, she wrote a book as well

1166
00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:01,340
 as the one that you were talking about

1167
00:37:01,340 --> 00:37:03,340
 called Not All Dead White Men.

1168
00:37:03,340 --> 00:37:05,340
 And the idea was she was talking about

1169
00:37:05,340 --> 00:37:07,340
 how the sort of alt-right of America

1170
00:37:07,340 --> 00:37:11,220
 have really harnessed all the Roman ideas and so on.

1171
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:14,780
 And of it is very much connected to the Neil Strauss

1172
00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:17,420
 the game pickup artist movement that's going on.

1173
00:37:17,420 --> 00:37:19,380
 And she wants to keep showing the connection

1174
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:20,860
 between those two things.

1175
00:37:20,860 --> 00:37:23,900
 And it's so interesting that she is Mark Zuckerberg's sister

1176
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:26,100
 because the very first thing that he did

1177
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:27,980
 was a site called FaceMash

1178
00:37:27,980 --> 00:37:30,860
 where you got students who went to Harvard University,

1179
00:37:30,860 --> 00:37:33,580
 both women, their pictures, which he hacked off a system

1180
00:37:33,580 --> 00:37:35,740
 and you ranked who you thought was hotter.

1181
00:37:35,740 --> 00:37:38,220
 That was the original Facebook, basically.

1182
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:41,060
 And so she must have been horrified by that

1183
00:37:41,060 --> 00:37:44,060
 and decided to dedicate her life

1184
00:37:44,060 --> 00:37:46,820
 to showing what a misogynistic move that was by her brother.

1185
00:37:46,820 --> 00:37:48,220
 - Sounds like they have parted ways.

1186
00:37:48,220 --> 00:37:50,460
 Well, so she's saying Ovid was a misogynist

1187
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:51,820
 and so these guys sort of see--

1188
00:37:51,820 --> 00:37:53,740
 - She's not necessarily, she's sort of saying that

1189
00:37:53,740 --> 00:37:54,900
 as Andy was saying before,

1190
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:58,860
 it's that thing of using an old historical idea

1191
00:37:58,860 --> 00:38:01,020
 to give legitimacy to why you're--

1192
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:02,900
 - We can't all blame the fact

1193
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:04,780
 that men keep the threatening my maid.

1194
00:38:04,860 --> 00:38:07,100
 (laughing)

1195
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:08,100
 - Oh, no, Ovid.

1196
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:11,220
 - 'Cause a lot of it does obviously read quite sleazy,

1197
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:12,060
 but a lot of it doesn't.

1198
00:38:12,060 --> 00:38:13,700
 You know, he says, send very eloquent love notes.

1199
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:15,060
 Cry in front of your loved one.

1200
00:38:15,060 --> 00:38:17,180
 I don't recall seeing Andrew Tate saying,

1201
00:38:17,180 --> 00:38:19,220
 "You've gotta be able to cry in front of her."

1202
00:38:19,220 --> 00:38:21,500
 You know, that's not, it is a bit different.

1203
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:22,340
 - But what's also different

1204
00:38:22,340 --> 00:38:24,820
 in which Donna Zuckerberg writes about in her book

1205
00:38:24,820 --> 00:38:26,460
 is that it was actually,

1206
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:28,100
 it was quite a lot more dangerous

1207
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:29,860
 in the times the advice that he was giving

1208
00:38:29,860 --> 00:38:31,340
 because when he was saying things like,

1209
00:38:31,340 --> 00:38:34,220
 befriend the husband of the person you're fancying,

1210
00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:35,740
 there was death penalties back in the day

1211
00:38:35,740 --> 00:38:38,220
 for things like if you were having a child out of wedlock,

1212
00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:39,700
 if you were, well, it was dangerous.

1213
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:41,100
 It was, there would be certain things

1214
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:43,020
 that you weren't allowed to do that in this day and age.

1215
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:46,660
 You'd get away as sort of just, it's bad manners, but--

1216
00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:48,620
 - Is that how you think the affair's gonna go down then?

1217
00:38:48,620 --> 00:38:49,460
 - Yeah.

1218
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:50,300
 (laughing)

1219
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:51,140
 - That's Charlie Berger's.

1220
00:38:51,140 --> 00:38:52,700
 (laughing)

1221
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:53,980
 - No, but yeah, so she points out

1222
00:38:53,980 --> 00:38:57,740
 that the risk level was much higher back then

1223
00:38:57,740 --> 00:38:59,380
 if you were employing these tactics

1224
00:38:59,380 --> 00:39:01,420
 and they worked on certain women in society.

1225
00:39:01,420 --> 00:39:02,420
 - Yeah. - Yeah.

1226
00:39:02,420 --> 00:39:04,340
 - And he suffered the pay the price

1227
00:39:04,340 --> 00:39:06,300
 'cause he suffered relegatio.

1228
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:07,140
 - He did.

1229
00:39:07,140 --> 00:39:08,740
 - That was the official term for the exile

1230
00:39:08,740 --> 00:39:09,580
 that he was put through.

1231
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:11,020
 - And he died out in--

1232
00:39:11,020 --> 00:39:11,860
 - Died out there?

1233
00:39:11,860 --> 00:39:14,100
 Relegatio was the mildest form of exile.

1234
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:16,340
 - What I want to know is when he died,

1235
00:39:16,340 --> 00:39:17,780
 was he with somebody?

1236
00:39:17,780 --> 00:39:19,240
 Was he, did he find love?

1237
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:21,940
 Did he die in exile alone?

1238
00:39:21,940 --> 00:39:24,620
 - His last word was when, and sadly--

1239
00:39:24,620 --> 00:39:26,420
 (laughing)

1240
00:39:26,420 --> 00:39:28,660
 We don't know the answer.

1241
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:30,220
 No, he died very unhappy.

1242
00:39:30,220 --> 00:39:32,980
 The last 10 years, he was writing these trusty-eye letters

1243
00:39:32,980 --> 00:39:35,660
 and it was, his book had been banned from libraries

1244
00:39:35,660 --> 00:39:37,580
 and he said, "Look, it's completely awful out here

1245
00:39:37,580 --> 00:39:39,980
 "in modern day Romania."

1246
00:39:39,980 --> 00:39:42,620
 He said, "You know, the wine freezes in the jars

1247
00:39:42,620 --> 00:39:44,460
 "and the ice is so thick on the black sea,

1248
00:39:44,460 --> 00:39:46,140
 "the dolphins can't even jump through the water."

1249
00:39:46,140 --> 00:39:49,060
 You know, really horrible, poor guy.

1250
00:39:49,060 --> 00:39:52,460
 But he was constantly writing poems to his friends

1251
00:39:52,460 --> 00:39:54,340
 and to the emperor and to his wife,

1252
00:39:54,340 --> 00:39:56,740
 probably in that order, to defend his cause,

1253
00:39:56,740 --> 00:39:58,620
 say, "I'm really sorry about all the licentious stuff.

1254
00:39:58,620 --> 00:40:01,100
 "I can change, and I will change,

1255
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:04,300
 "and create pity for himself," and it did not work.

1256
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:05,820
 - That's so sad, it reminds me a bit of,

1257
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:09,060
 you know how John Dunn used to write lots of sexy poems?

1258
00:40:09,060 --> 00:40:11,780
 And then, in his later life, he did lots of like,

1259
00:40:11,780 --> 00:40:16,940
 "Nuh," all his poems were like, "No, ah, God, God, ah."

1260
00:40:16,940 --> 00:40:18,780
 They were all, that was the kind of vibe.

1261
00:40:18,780 --> 00:40:19,620
 - Right.

1262
00:40:19,620 --> 00:40:20,460
 - I didn't know he'd got more like that.

1263
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:21,980
 I feel like I've read more of the sexy stuff.

1264
00:40:21,980 --> 00:40:23,740
 - Yeah, as only ones are all sexy,

1265
00:40:23,740 --> 00:40:26,540
 and then the later ones are all more self-hating,

1266
00:40:26,540 --> 00:40:30,620
 "God, forgive me," and I'm like, "Sexy past."

1267
00:40:30,620 --> 00:40:32,180
 - God, we all turn into such balls, don't we?

1268
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:33,380
 It's like Tolstoy.

1269
00:40:33,380 --> 00:40:36,940
 No one ever stays the fun playboy/playgirl.

1270
00:40:36,940 --> 00:40:38,220
 Yeah, it's very sad.

1271
00:40:38,220 --> 00:40:39,740
 - Bit of a good update on Ovid.

1272
00:40:39,740 --> 00:40:41,580
 I do have a bit of good news about the...

1273
00:40:41,580 --> 00:40:43,740
 - So right with that sentence.

1274
00:40:43,740 --> 00:40:44,580
 - Is this breaking news?

1275
00:40:44,580 --> 00:40:45,460
 Has this just come in?

1276
00:40:45,460 --> 00:40:50,460
 - It's recent because Ovid's exile was eventually revoked

1277
00:40:51,380 --> 00:40:56,380
 in 2017, when Rome's city council,

1278
00:40:56,380 --> 00:40:58,900
 who were not what they once were, I suspect,

1279
00:40:58,900 --> 00:41:01,540
 voted to repair the serious wrong that he had suffered,

1280
00:41:01,540 --> 00:41:04,540
 and say his exile was now officially ended.

1281
00:41:04,540 --> 00:41:07,300
 - Was he like the knight in Indiana Jones 3?

1282
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:08,640
 Is he loud?

1283
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:10,180
 - He came back, he came back.

1284
00:41:10,180 --> 00:41:11,420
 - Oh, so bad.

1285
00:41:11,420 --> 00:41:13,580
 - You decided, why is he here?

1286
00:41:13,580 --> 00:41:16,160
 (upbeat music)

1287
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:20,980
 - Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show,

1288
00:41:20,980 --> 00:41:22,740
 and that is Andy.

1289
00:41:22,740 --> 00:41:24,180
 - My fact is that the largest collection

1290
00:41:24,180 --> 00:41:26,620
 of contemporary South African art in the world

1291
00:41:26,620 --> 00:41:29,180
 is in Nando's.

1292
00:41:29,180 --> 00:41:30,540
 - Which branch?

1293
00:41:30,540 --> 00:41:32,140
 - Every branch.

1294
00:41:32,140 --> 00:41:32,980
 No, no, I'm joking.

1295
00:41:32,980 --> 00:41:35,500
 The Manchester, Salford Key's one.

1296
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:36,820
 - That's a good one.

1297
00:41:36,820 --> 00:41:37,960
 - Yeah, and it's big.

1298
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:40,860
 So there was a terrific piece in The Guardian recently

1299
00:41:40,860 --> 00:41:43,820
 about Nando's collection of modern South African art.

1300
00:41:43,820 --> 00:41:45,260
 Nando's is a chicken restaurant.

1301
00:41:45,260 --> 00:41:47,140
 For anyone who doesn't know,

1302
00:41:47,140 --> 00:41:48,300
 I don't know, we have American listeners.

1303
00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:49,140
 Do you have Nando's?

1304
00:41:49,140 --> 00:41:50,340
 - I don't think they do have Nando's

1305
00:41:50,340 --> 00:41:51,180
 in the United States.

1306
00:41:51,180 --> 00:41:52,020
 - In America, should we have a Nando's everywhere?

1307
00:41:52,020 --> 00:41:53,020
 - Nando's is global, yeah.

1308
00:41:53,020 --> 00:41:53,860
 - Yeah.

1309
00:41:53,860 --> 00:41:57,500
 - But it's the biggest here, I think it's worth explaining.

1310
00:41:57,500 --> 00:41:58,500
 I've only been to one.

1311
00:41:58,500 --> 00:42:00,540
 - Here is the highest ever peri peri penetration

1312
00:42:00,540 --> 00:42:01,820
 on the planet, I think, in this country.

1313
00:42:01,820 --> 00:42:03,660
 You've only ever been to one Nando's.

1314
00:42:03,660 --> 00:42:05,660
 - Would you guys, in fact, yeah.

1315
00:42:05,660 --> 00:42:06,500
 - Oh, on tour?

1316
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:07,340
 - On tour, was it?

1317
00:42:07,340 --> 00:42:08,180
 Was it the one at Salford?

1318
00:42:08,180 --> 00:42:09,340
 - It was the one at Salford, yeah.

1319
00:42:09,340 --> 00:42:11,020
 And I only went for the art.

1320
00:42:11,020 --> 00:42:12,900
 (laughing)

1321
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:14,220
 - Would you like anything, madam?

1322
00:42:14,220 --> 00:42:17,380
 Just a tour of your 70s pieces, please, yeah.

1323
00:42:17,380 --> 00:42:20,020
 Seriously, you've only been to Nando's once in your life.

1324
00:42:20,020 --> 00:42:21,980
 - Yeah, I don't really like dry chicken.

1325
00:42:21,980 --> 00:42:24,180
 - Well, it is quite dry chicken.

1326
00:42:24,180 --> 00:42:25,020
 - It's dry.

1327
00:42:25,020 --> 00:42:28,300
 - But he says that there are more than 20 countries, Nando's.

1328
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:29,140
 - Uh-huh.

1329
00:42:29,140 --> 00:42:30,820
 - I think you've got to be more than that, you know.

1330
00:42:30,820 --> 00:42:31,660
 - Yeah.

1331
00:42:31,660 --> 00:42:33,060
 - Actually, it's not that much, isn't it, really,

1332
00:42:33,060 --> 00:42:34,700
 in the grand scheme of countries.

1333
00:42:34,700 --> 00:42:36,020
 - It depends on the countries.

1334
00:42:36,020 --> 00:42:39,460
 - Yeah, if you're only in Tuvalu, Vanuatu.

1335
00:42:39,460 --> 00:42:40,940
 - Yeah, then you're doing something wrong

1336
00:42:40,940 --> 00:42:42,060
 in your marketing, I think.

1337
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:43,820
 - Yeah, so I don't know if they're in the USA,

1338
00:42:43,820 --> 00:42:46,100
 but yeah, they've got about 1,200 restaurants,

1339
00:42:46,100 --> 00:42:47,580
 and across those restaurants,

1340
00:42:47,580 --> 00:42:50,780
 they own 32,000 odd pieces of art,

1341
00:42:50,780 --> 00:42:53,540
 and they buy another couple of thousand every year.

1342
00:42:53,540 --> 00:42:55,900
 And it's the main, seems to be the main thing,

1343
00:42:55,900 --> 00:42:59,180
 keeping the South African contemporary art market going.

1344
00:42:59,180 --> 00:43:00,020
 - Well, it's really nice.

1345
00:43:00,020 --> 00:43:01,580
 - They re-support artists, yeah.

1346
00:43:01,580 --> 00:43:03,500
 - They have a thing called the Creative Block Programme,

1347
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:05,860
 where they basically hand out wooden blocks

1348
00:43:05,860 --> 00:43:06,700
 for it to be drawn on.

1349
00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:08,500
 So it's original commissions as well,

1350
00:43:08,500 --> 00:43:10,580
 and they have programs where they look after artists.

1351
00:43:10,580 --> 00:43:12,620
 It's, I don't know, the rest of the business is like--

1352
00:43:12,620 --> 00:43:15,860
 - Sorry, they like send wooden blocks to South Africans

1353
00:43:15,860 --> 00:43:17,780
 and say, "Draw something on this and send it back to us."

1354
00:43:17,780 --> 00:43:19,620
 - Well, two artists who are on the scheme,

1355
00:43:19,620 --> 00:43:22,180
 like they run all these schemes for young artists,

1356
00:43:22,180 --> 00:43:25,980
 and they run a thing where it's an apprenticeship program

1357
00:43:25,980 --> 00:43:27,980
 where they take disadvantaged young people

1358
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:30,940
 who don't have skills, and they train them up over three years

1359
00:43:30,940 --> 00:43:33,180
 to become mosaicists or ceramicists.

1360
00:43:33,180 --> 00:43:34,020
 - Oh, wow!

1361
00:43:34,020 --> 00:43:34,860
 - It's quite cool, yeah.

1362
00:43:34,860 --> 00:43:36,580
 And then obviously you get skills.

1363
00:43:36,580 --> 00:43:39,380
 So yeah, so Nando's doing something quite good.

1364
00:43:39,380 --> 00:43:41,380
 I don't know many other restaurants that--

1365
00:43:41,380 --> 00:43:42,220
 - No.

1366
00:43:42,220 --> 00:43:43,180
 - Oh, any of the restaurants that do this.

1367
00:43:43,180 --> 00:43:44,380
 Does Pizza Express have a--

1368
00:43:44,380 --> 00:43:46,580
 - Well, we didn't know this about Nando's, you know.

1369
00:43:46,580 --> 00:43:48,300
 Pizza Express might have the largest collection

1370
00:43:48,300 --> 00:43:50,580
 of statues in the world, but we don't know.

1371
00:43:50,580 --> 00:43:52,900
 They also do a mentorship scheme,

1372
00:43:52,900 --> 00:43:55,340
 which is basically for furniture, lighting designers.

1373
00:43:55,340 --> 00:43:56,860
 They have a lot of this stuff.

1374
00:43:56,860 --> 00:43:58,140
 The only one that I can think of

1375
00:43:58,140 --> 00:44:01,020
 that does a similar kind of scheme is Whole Foods.

1376
00:44:01,020 --> 00:44:03,180
 Globally, in every Whole Foods,

1377
00:44:03,180 --> 00:44:06,980
 they hire someone who is the artist in store.

1378
00:44:06,980 --> 00:44:08,340
 So when you go into Whole Foods,

1379
00:44:08,340 --> 00:44:09,540
 you might see a lot of different art.

1380
00:44:09,540 --> 00:44:10,540
 You might see a lot of different,

1381
00:44:10,540 --> 00:44:13,100
 like paper mache sculptures around the mushrooms.

1382
00:44:13,100 --> 00:44:14,180
 They might have a big mushroom.

1383
00:44:14,180 --> 00:44:16,540
 That's one person who's doing it bespoke

1384
00:44:16,540 --> 00:44:18,780
 for the Whole Foods as part of the payroll.

1385
00:44:18,780 --> 00:44:19,620
 - Really? - Yeah.

1386
00:44:19,620 --> 00:44:21,180
 - And they're always sculptures of the food.

1387
00:44:21,180 --> 00:44:22,340
 - No, no, like whatever it is,

1388
00:44:22,340 --> 00:44:23,660
 whatever they decide to do

1389
00:44:23,660 --> 00:44:26,020
 as the resident artist of Whole Foods,

1390
00:44:26,020 --> 00:44:27,060
 they get to do. - Okay, sorry.

1391
00:44:27,060 --> 00:44:28,100
 I thought you meant it was like, you know,

1392
00:44:28,100 --> 00:44:30,780
 in Japan when they show sushi,

1393
00:44:30,780 --> 00:44:32,420
 they have sushi models outside restaurants.

1394
00:44:32,420 --> 00:44:33,260
 It's not like that.

1395
00:44:33,260 --> 00:44:34,100
 You're like in the carrots

1396
00:44:34,100 --> 00:44:34,940
 and you've got caramel. - No, no, no.

1397
00:44:34,940 --> 00:44:36,180
 It'll be signs, it will be posters,

1398
00:44:36,180 --> 00:44:38,500
 whatever they want to do, but that's their job.

1399
00:44:38,500 --> 00:44:39,340
 They're the Whole Foods artist.

1400
00:44:39,340 --> 00:44:40,180
 - That's really cool.

1401
00:44:40,180 --> 00:44:42,220
 - Yeah, I was quite slow on the uptake on that.

1402
00:44:42,220 --> 00:44:45,020
 I was thinking, what are they working behind the counter?

1403
00:44:45,020 --> 00:44:46,700
 It's like, well, let's take an artist

1404
00:44:46,700 --> 00:44:49,340
 and get them giving out fish.

1405
00:44:49,340 --> 00:44:50,900
 - Give them a proper career.

1406
00:44:50,900 --> 00:44:52,060
 - Something that'll earn them some money.

1407
00:44:52,060 --> 00:44:53,940
 - I just want, we're buying this salmon, this broccoli,

1408
00:44:53,940 --> 00:44:56,020
 and I'd like a sketch of me, please,

1409
00:44:56,020 --> 00:44:57,020
 while you ring it up.

1410
00:44:57,020 --> 00:44:58,460
 - Domino's Pizza.

1411
00:44:58,460 --> 00:44:59,380
 - Do they have corporate art?

1412
00:44:59,380 --> 00:45:02,340
 - Well, they have a really close link to Frank Lloyd Wright.

1413
00:45:02,340 --> 00:45:04,980
 Like probably the most famous architects,

1414
00:45:04,980 --> 00:45:06,940
 20th century American architects, one of them.

1415
00:45:06,940 --> 00:45:08,780
 And like, you know, had all these utopian visions

1416
00:45:08,780 --> 00:45:10,540
 of what he wanted to do with his architecture.

1417
00:45:10,540 --> 00:45:12,860
 And the founder of Domino's Pizza,

1418
00:45:12,860 --> 00:45:15,220
 this chap called Thomas Monaghan,

1419
00:45:15,220 --> 00:45:17,220
 and he bloody loved Frank Lloyd Wright,

1420
00:45:17,220 --> 00:45:18,780
 it was in the '60s when he founded him,

1421
00:45:18,780 --> 00:45:21,620
 and he was responsible in the '80s

1422
00:45:21,620 --> 00:45:23,780
 for Frank Lloyd Wright's works,

1423
00:45:23,780 --> 00:45:25,900
 like his furnishings and his decorative art,

1424
00:45:25,900 --> 00:45:27,620
 going up in price, single-handedly,

1425
00:45:27,620 --> 00:45:28,940
 'cause he just spent millions.

1426
00:45:28,940 --> 00:45:30,500
 - Did Frank design the little table

1427
00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:32,900
 that goes inside the pizza box?

1428
00:45:32,900 --> 00:45:34,220
 - I don't understand.

1429
00:45:34,220 --> 00:45:37,100
 So what was Frank doing to the pizzas?

1430
00:45:37,100 --> 00:45:38,900
 - Ah, so...

1431
00:45:38,900 --> 00:45:42,380
 - He was a side job just to fund the architecture.

1432
00:45:42,380 --> 00:45:44,420
 - I don't think Frank gave a shit about pizzas,

1433
00:45:44,420 --> 00:45:46,860
 but I think he was dead by this point.

1434
00:45:46,860 --> 00:45:48,700
 (all laughing)

1435
00:45:48,700 --> 00:45:51,060
 - So this is getting more tenuous by the moment.

1436
00:45:51,060 --> 00:45:53,460
 - No, because the whole of Domino's Pizza

1437
00:45:53,460 --> 00:45:55,620
 is like based around Frank Lloyd Wright architecture.

1438
00:45:55,620 --> 00:46:00,620
 So its center of operations is a place called Domino's Farms,

1439
00:46:00,620 --> 00:46:02,540
 it's World HQ, and the whole building

1440
00:46:02,540 --> 00:46:04,380
 is meant to imitate Frank Lloyd Wright's

1441
00:46:04,380 --> 00:46:06,220
 prairie style buildings.

1442
00:46:06,220 --> 00:46:08,740
 Because the founder of Domino's is so obsessed with him,

1443
00:46:08,740 --> 00:46:10,500
 and there's a whole section in it,

1444
00:46:10,500 --> 00:46:11,980
 which is a gallery and exhibition

1445
00:46:11,980 --> 00:46:14,740
 of Frank Lloyd Wright artworks, which he's bought up.

1446
00:46:14,740 --> 00:46:16,220
 He's spent more on Frank Lloyd Wright artwork

1447
00:46:16,220 --> 00:46:18,260
 than anyone else in the world.

1448
00:46:18,260 --> 00:46:19,620
 - Rosie, do you collect art?

1449
00:46:19,620 --> 00:46:20,940
 Have you got any pieces in your house?

1450
00:46:20,940 --> 00:46:22,940
 - No, not yet.

1451
00:46:22,940 --> 00:46:23,780
 - Okay.

1452
00:46:23,780 --> 00:46:24,620
 - Anyone else?

1453
00:46:24,620 --> 00:46:25,620
 - I might from this Frank man.

1454
00:46:25,620 --> 00:46:27,780
 (all laughing)

1455
00:46:27,780 --> 00:46:30,260
 Again, I don't know if he's still available to buy from.

1456
00:46:30,260 --> 00:46:32,220
 (all laughing)

1457
00:46:32,220 --> 00:46:33,420
 Are you an Ando's fan?

1458
00:46:33,420 --> 00:46:37,780
 So like you, I find the chicken a bit dry.

1459
00:46:38,620 --> 00:46:40,860
 Also, is it free range?

1460
00:46:40,860 --> 00:46:42,980
 I don't know if the chicken's free range, is it?

1461
00:46:42,980 --> 00:46:43,980
 - It's already good.

1462
00:46:43,980 --> 00:46:48,020
 - And like, if I have battery chicken, I get chicken guilt.

1463
00:46:48,020 --> 00:46:53,020
 - Okay, but it is an interesting place in general,

1464
00:46:53,020 --> 00:46:56,860
 because, well, it started in 1987, as did I.

1465
00:46:56,860 --> 00:46:57,700
 - That is interesting.

1466
00:46:57,700 --> 00:46:58,540
 - Yeah, yeah.

1467
00:46:58,540 --> 00:47:00,740
 So, you know, I feel an affinity with them,

1468
00:47:00,740 --> 00:47:02,940
 but there is this big thing of the Nando's black card,

1469
00:47:02,940 --> 00:47:05,300
 and I know I've got three people who've all got one,

1470
00:47:05,300 --> 00:47:09,380
 which means you have free Nando's anytime, any place.

1471
00:47:09,380 --> 00:47:10,340
 - Forever and ever.

1472
00:47:10,340 --> 00:47:12,180
 - Yeah, my buddy Tom Davis had it.

1473
00:47:12,180 --> 00:47:13,020
 Do you know Big Tom?

1474
00:47:13,020 --> 00:47:13,860
 - Yes.

1475
00:47:13,860 --> 00:47:17,460
 - Yeah, Tom and I used to go almost every day

1476
00:47:17,460 --> 00:47:19,620
 with his black card in Kentish town.

1477
00:47:19,620 --> 00:47:21,620
 - You've got to use one of the black cards.

1478
00:47:21,620 --> 00:47:22,460
 - Many times.

1479
00:47:22,460 --> 00:47:23,740
 - And why was he given one?

1480
00:47:23,740 --> 00:47:27,260
 'Cause the person I know who had one was a radio host

1481
00:47:27,260 --> 00:47:30,140
 who was cool at the time.

1482
00:47:30,140 --> 00:47:31,340
 - It's just for being famous.

1483
00:47:31,340 --> 00:47:32,180
 I think they're open for that.

1484
00:47:32,180 --> 00:47:33,340
 - Tom wasn't famous at the time.

1485
00:47:33,340 --> 00:47:34,180
 - How did he get one then?

1486
00:47:34,180 --> 00:47:35,660
 - Tom called up Nando's,

1487
00:47:35,660 --> 00:47:37,140
 and he said, "I'm interested in the black card."

1488
00:47:37,140 --> 00:47:39,900
 And then he got called up to the chicken council,

1489
00:47:39,900 --> 00:47:44,020
 and he had to present his case for why he wanted it.

1490
00:47:44,020 --> 00:47:45,780
 - Who sits on the chicken council?

1491
00:47:45,780 --> 00:47:48,860
 - That's a, we don't know, that's like the library.

1492
00:47:48,860 --> 00:47:49,780
 We don't know what's going on.

1493
00:47:49,780 --> 00:47:52,380
 (all laughing)

1494
00:47:52,380 --> 00:47:55,540
 - Are they in chicken suits?

1495
00:47:55,540 --> 00:47:57,100
 - Well, they wanted chicken suits,

1496
00:47:57,100 --> 00:48:00,100
 but they only had gorilla suits at the time.

1497
00:48:00,100 --> 00:48:02,420
 - Do you know anyone who has the dishume dice?

1498
00:48:02,420 --> 00:48:04,300
 You heard about the dishume dice.

1499
00:48:04,300 --> 00:48:06,860
 So Isha Anakbar has the dishume dice,

1500
00:48:06,860 --> 00:48:11,140
 and what it is, is at the end, you throw the dice,

1501
00:48:11,140 --> 00:48:14,060
 and if it lands, if you get two sixes,

1502
00:48:14,060 --> 00:48:17,500
 then you get to get the whole meal for free.

1503
00:48:17,500 --> 00:48:18,340
 - Really?

1504
00:48:18,340 --> 00:48:19,180
 - No way.

1505
00:48:19,180 --> 00:48:21,140
 And what do you have to do to get the dishume dice?

1506
00:48:21,140 --> 00:48:22,380
 - I don't know.

1507
00:48:22,380 --> 00:48:24,540
 - Yes, 'cause that feels like a relatively low-risk

1508
00:48:24,540 --> 00:48:25,700
 financial investment for them.

1509
00:48:25,700 --> 00:48:27,740
 Send a couple of plastic dice out to some influencers,

1510
00:48:27,740 --> 00:48:29,060
 and they have a one-in-thirty-six chance

1511
00:48:29,060 --> 00:48:29,980
 of getting their meal for free.

1512
00:48:29,980 --> 00:48:34,620
 - I went, and he rolled, and we'd ordered so much food,

1513
00:48:34,620 --> 00:48:36,220
 and he got it, we got it all for free,

1514
00:48:36,220 --> 00:48:37,060
 and they were so...

1515
00:48:37,060 --> 00:48:38,420
 - He got two sixes.

1516
00:48:38,420 --> 00:48:39,500
 - I think they were really upset

1517
00:48:39,500 --> 00:48:42,420
 because they looked like they didn't even know...

1518
00:48:42,420 --> 00:48:43,740
 - Oh my god.

1519
00:48:43,740 --> 00:48:44,780
 I mean, yeah.

1520
00:48:44,780 --> 00:48:45,940
 - 'Cause you can get them weighted.

1521
00:48:45,940 --> 00:48:48,300
 You can get those, but that's what I would do.

1522
00:48:48,300 --> 00:48:49,820
 I would go off and have them weighted

1523
00:48:49,820 --> 00:48:51,380
 so that no matter what, they land on six.

1524
00:48:51,380 --> 00:48:52,380
 - Maybe you can't do that

1525
00:48:52,380 --> 00:48:53,780
 'cause their special dishume dice.

1526
00:48:53,780 --> 00:48:56,340
 - They must be designed to look like this.

1527
00:48:56,340 --> 00:48:57,980
 But if you pay just a few thousand pounds

1528
00:48:57,980 --> 00:49:01,780
 to a dice craster, he'll be able to make you two double six

1529
00:49:01,780 --> 00:49:04,180
 every time, but then that'll go on the spreadsheet

1530
00:49:04,180 --> 00:49:05,380
 at Dishume's queue.

1531
00:49:05,380 --> 00:49:07,300
 - Well, you know that spot, don't tell your mate.

1532
00:49:07,300 --> 00:49:09,980
 I know the world-leading dice.

1533
00:49:09,980 --> 00:49:11,620
 He makes the weighted dices.

1534
00:49:11,620 --> 00:49:13,860
 He does them for people like, "Get out!"

1535
00:49:13,860 --> 00:49:15,700
 - Dan, I thought you were just bullshitting then

1536
00:49:15,700 --> 00:49:17,260
 when you were saying with such authority,

1537
00:49:17,260 --> 00:49:19,420
 you know you can get any dice you like weighted.

1538
00:49:19,420 --> 00:49:21,500
 - I had drinks with him with the world-leading...

1539
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:22,940
 - You're giving away background secrets.

1540
00:49:22,940 --> 00:49:24,580
 Are you supposed to tell us?

1541
00:49:24,580 --> 00:49:26,900
 - We can redact that in the, yeah.

1542
00:49:26,900 --> 00:49:29,260
 - He's very good friends with my friend

1543
00:49:29,260 --> 00:49:30,340
 who's the Loch Ness Monster Hunter

1544
00:49:30,340 --> 00:49:31,940
 and we had drinks on Loch Ness

1545
00:49:31,940 --> 00:49:33,700
 and he told us all about the dice he showed us.

1546
00:49:33,700 --> 00:49:35,660
 Anyway, that's an incredible fact about Dishume.

1547
00:49:35,660 --> 00:49:36,500
 - Yeah, that's terrific.

1548
00:49:36,500 --> 00:49:38,980
 - That's an incredible fact of yours about Tom

1549
00:49:38,980 --> 00:49:41,980
 because Nando's insist that the only rule is

1550
00:49:41,980 --> 00:49:44,540
 they never give their black card to anyone who asked for it.

1551
00:49:44,540 --> 00:49:45,660
 They say it's just if you're famous.

1552
00:49:45,660 --> 00:49:46,900
 - But how wonderful.

1553
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:49,540
 Before this, I didn't even know there was a chicken committee.

1554
00:49:49,540 --> 00:49:51,780
 (laughing)

1555
00:49:51,780 --> 00:49:54,500
 So you think, what are the chicken committee

1556
00:49:54,500 --> 00:49:55,500
 doing the rest of the chicken?

1557
00:49:55,500 --> 00:49:56,940
 (laughing)

1558
00:49:56,940 --> 00:49:58,620
 - Yeah, it's wall-to-wall.

1559
00:49:58,620 --> 00:50:00,300
 They're pecking, they're walking.

1560
00:50:00,300 --> 00:50:01,940
 (laughing)

1561
00:50:01,940 --> 00:50:04,180
 - I was looking at some logo stuff.

1562
00:50:04,180 --> 00:50:05,580
 Corporate art logos.

1563
00:50:05,580 --> 00:50:08,500
 Do you guys know/remember?

1564
00:50:08,500 --> 00:50:09,700
 I don't know if any of you are old enough.

1565
00:50:09,700 --> 00:50:11,660
 Rosie, don't know how old you are, you could be 60.

1566
00:50:11,660 --> 00:50:12,500
 - I am 60.

1567
00:50:12,500 --> 00:50:15,500
 - And if so, you might remember the time

1568
00:50:15,500 --> 00:50:18,620
 when the Starbucks logo was naked.

1569
00:50:18,620 --> 00:50:19,460
 - Oh.

1570
00:50:19,460 --> 00:50:20,580
 - So you know she has hair over her breast now,

1571
00:50:20,580 --> 00:50:21,540
 she used to have tits out.

1572
00:50:21,540 --> 00:50:22,380
 - Oh, naked.

1573
00:50:22,380 --> 00:50:23,220
 - Stop it, did she?

1574
00:50:23,220 --> 00:50:25,020
 Are you gonna have to Google this right now?

1575
00:50:25,020 --> 00:50:26,860
 - Yeah, 'cause she's a mermaid, right?

1576
00:50:26,860 --> 00:50:27,700
 - Is she?

1577
00:50:27,700 --> 00:50:28,540
 - Yeah, yeah, she's a mermaid.

1578
00:50:28,540 --> 00:50:29,580
 Although she has two tails,

1579
00:50:29,580 --> 00:50:31,860
 so it's quite an unconventional mermaid.

1580
00:50:31,860 --> 00:50:33,180
 - Oh, look, there she is.

1581
00:50:33,180 --> 00:50:34,820
 - She's actually quite unattractive and frumpy.

1582
00:50:34,820 --> 00:50:36,220
 - She's very unattractive.

1583
00:50:36,220 --> 00:50:37,740
 I don't wanna judge her.

1584
00:50:37,740 --> 00:50:38,580
 - I'll judge her.

1585
00:50:38,580 --> 00:50:40,700
 - This is a 15th century drawing of a siren though,

1586
00:50:40,700 --> 00:50:41,780
 and that was the Starbucks logo.

1587
00:50:41,780 --> 00:50:45,300
 - She looks like you're drunk uncle at a wedding.

1588
00:50:45,300 --> 00:50:46,140
 - Wow.

1589
00:50:46,140 --> 00:50:46,980
 - Yeah.

1590
00:50:46,980 --> 00:50:47,820
 She does look drunk,

1591
00:50:47,820 --> 00:50:48,900
 'cause she looks like she's saying,

1592
00:50:48,900 --> 00:50:50,060
 "I've caught these two fish,"

1593
00:50:50,060 --> 00:50:52,300
 and doesn't realize she's holding her own lower body.

1594
00:50:52,300 --> 00:50:54,740
 - Oh, that's classic, yeah, yeah.

1595
00:50:54,740 --> 00:50:56,820
 - Wow, so for two women who are very positive

1596
00:50:56,820 --> 00:50:59,980
 about Mrs. Gaskell, it's not universal sisterhood.

1597
00:50:59,980 --> 00:51:00,820
 - No, no.

1598
00:51:00,820 --> 00:51:01,660
 - This is not what a feminist looks like.

1599
00:51:01,660 --> 00:51:03,860
 - I don't know, they're both in agreement though.

1600
00:51:03,860 --> 00:51:04,700
 At least it's consistency.

1601
00:51:04,700 --> 00:51:06,540
 - You just gotta go with us.

1602
00:51:06,540 --> 00:51:08,660
 - That's what true femininity looks like.

1603
00:51:08,660 --> 00:51:12,220
 - So that was the Starbucks logo,

1604
00:51:12,220 --> 00:51:13,780
 a weird 15th century--

1605
00:51:13,780 --> 00:51:15,140
 - Why did they change it?

1606
00:51:15,140 --> 00:51:16,380
 That's not it.

1607
00:51:16,380 --> 00:51:17,580
 - Well, it's just an upgrade, isn't it?

1608
00:51:17,580 --> 00:51:19,020
 Yeah, it's a Nordic woodcut.

1609
00:51:19,020 --> 00:51:22,620
 She is, yeah, boobs out and bits of tail in each hand.

1610
00:51:22,620 --> 00:51:24,100
 She looks more like she's holding fish now,

1611
00:51:24,100 --> 00:51:25,660
 'cause you can't see the bottom of her tail.

1612
00:51:25,660 --> 00:51:26,900
 So if you look at the Starbucks logo,

1613
00:51:26,900 --> 00:51:28,580
 it looks like she's just holding two dead fish.

1614
00:51:28,580 --> 00:51:29,420
 - Right.

1615
00:51:29,420 --> 00:51:30,740
 - I don't think they sell anything with fish.

1616
00:51:30,740 --> 00:51:32,540
 - They don't sell anything fish-related.

1617
00:51:32,540 --> 00:51:34,780
 - No, they do, they do the tuna macchiato.

1618
00:51:34,780 --> 00:51:35,620
 That is lovely.

1619
00:51:35,620 --> 00:51:36,980
 (laughing)

1620
00:51:36,980 --> 00:51:38,980
 That's really nice.

1621
00:51:38,980 --> 00:51:40,740
 So it was a controversial

1622
00:51:40,740 --> 00:51:42,460
 because she agreed to the one woodcut,

1623
00:51:42,460 --> 00:51:45,460
 but then they put her on all of the cups and all of the--

1624
00:51:45,460 --> 00:51:46,780
 - Yes.

1625
00:51:46,780 --> 00:51:47,700
 - Yeah, right.

1626
00:51:47,700 --> 00:51:49,620
 - Just to tie together this with the howling,

1627
00:51:49,620 --> 00:51:52,940
 I didn't spot any artworks on display in howling too.

1628
00:51:52,940 --> 00:51:53,900
 - Right.

1629
00:51:53,900 --> 00:51:57,500
 - But it's really hard to use original art in films.

1630
00:51:57,500 --> 00:51:59,420
 There are, like the world of image rights

1631
00:51:59,420 --> 00:52:00,820
 has tightened up a lot lately.

1632
00:52:00,820 --> 00:52:02,940
 You can't just, if you want to show the Mona Lisa

1633
00:52:02,940 --> 00:52:03,940
 or Girl with a Palm Earring or whatever,

1634
00:52:03,940 --> 00:52:05,580
 you can't just stick a print in a frame

1635
00:52:05,580 --> 00:52:07,620
 and pretend in the film.

1636
00:52:07,620 --> 00:52:09,900
 'Cause artistic estates get a bit funny about that

1637
00:52:09,900 --> 00:52:11,660
 and rightful owners and all of this.

1638
00:52:11,660 --> 00:52:14,420
 So lots of times when they make a film

1639
00:52:14,420 --> 00:52:16,380
 which features art, or they want it to include

1640
00:52:16,380 --> 00:52:18,500
 really famous art, they take weeks and weeks

1641
00:52:18,500 --> 00:52:21,740
 making replicas and then the estate of the artist

1642
00:52:21,740 --> 00:52:24,540
 insists that the artwork is destroyed,

1643
00:52:24,540 --> 00:52:27,180
 that the filmmakers record and film

1644
00:52:27,180 --> 00:52:29,180
 the destruction of the artwork

1645
00:52:29,180 --> 00:52:30,460
 and then send them the evidence

1646
00:52:30,460 --> 00:52:32,660
 of the fake artwork being destroyed.

1647
00:52:32,660 --> 00:52:34,020
 - That's so interesting 'cause you would figure--

1648
00:52:34,020 --> 00:52:34,860
 - That's insane.

1649
00:52:34,860 --> 00:52:36,700
 - You'd figure that would go on a memorabilia market

1650
00:52:36,700 --> 00:52:39,540
 as opposed to being passed off as a--

1651
00:52:39,540 --> 00:52:40,700
 - I don't know what they're worried about.

1652
00:52:40,700 --> 00:52:41,980
 It might be passing off, yeah.

1653
00:52:41,980 --> 00:52:44,260
 There was a film about Basquiat in 1996

1654
00:52:44,260 --> 00:52:46,180
 and the estate asked for so much money

1655
00:52:46,180 --> 00:52:47,940
 to use Basquiat images that they said,

1656
00:52:47,940 --> 00:52:49,540
 well, we can't make the film.

1657
00:52:49,540 --> 00:52:51,740
 So instead, they just knocked up a load

1658
00:52:51,740 --> 00:52:55,660
 of Basquiat style artwork.

1659
00:52:55,660 --> 00:52:57,860
 But then they had to have a lawyer look at all of the artworks

1660
00:52:57,860 --> 00:52:59,300
 and say, that's fine, that's fine,

1661
00:52:59,300 --> 00:53:02,100
 that's too close to actual Basquiat, can't use that.

1662
00:53:02,100 --> 00:53:02,940
 - Wow, wow.

1663
00:53:02,940 --> 00:53:04,460
 - So all of that is sort of artist approved, yeah.

1664
00:53:04,460 --> 00:53:06,340
 - Is any film producer ever experimented

1665
00:53:06,340 --> 00:53:07,620
 when they get that initial rejection

1666
00:53:07,620 --> 00:53:09,260
 with saying, okay, well instead,

1667
00:53:09,260 --> 00:53:12,180
 we'll draw a load of badly sketched cock and balls

1668
00:53:12,180 --> 00:53:13,380
 to claim that's Basquiat

1669
00:53:13,380 --> 00:53:15,500
 and see what the estate has to say about that?

1670
00:53:15,500 --> 00:53:16,740
 - I don't know.

1671
00:53:16,740 --> 00:53:18,260
 - I think the house is strong position.

1672
00:53:18,260 --> 00:53:19,420
 - You'd be a great film producer.

1673
00:53:19,420 --> 00:53:20,580
 You'd be like really ballsy.

1674
00:53:20,580 --> 00:53:22,300
 - That doesn't work for the movie.

1675
00:53:22,300 --> 00:53:23,740
 (all laughing)

1676
00:53:23,740 --> 00:53:25,620
 - If it's a da Vinci code, it's a bluff.

1677
00:53:25,620 --> 00:53:28,020
 - Yeah, in the da Vinci code,

1678
00:53:28,020 --> 00:53:30,140
 if the Mona Lisa looked like--

1679
00:53:30,140 --> 00:53:31,420
 - It's like a cock and balls.

1680
00:53:31,420 --> 00:53:32,740
 (all laughing)

1681
00:53:32,740 --> 00:53:34,980
 You've got to hope that they bring first.

1682
00:53:34,980 --> 00:53:35,820
 (all laughing)

1683
00:53:35,820 --> 00:53:37,580
 Otherwise, you're stuck with the wind film.

1684
00:53:37,580 --> 00:53:38,980
 - Who's gonna look more stupid?

1685
00:53:38,980 --> 00:53:40,740
 I don't know, I don't know.

1686
00:53:40,740 --> 00:53:42,620
 (all laughing)

1687
00:53:42,620 --> 00:53:45,200
 (upbeat music)

1688
00:53:47,900 --> 00:53:48,900
 - Okay, that's it.

1689
00:53:48,900 --> 00:53:49,860
 That is all of our facts.

1690
00:53:49,860 --> 00:53:51,380
