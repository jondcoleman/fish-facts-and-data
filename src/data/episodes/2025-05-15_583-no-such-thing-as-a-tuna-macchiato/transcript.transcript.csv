00:00:00,00:00:01,"- Hi, everybody."
00:00:01,00:00:03,"Before we start the show, I just wanted to let you know"
00:00:03,00:00:06,I'm joined by a very exciting guest right now.
00:00:06,00:00:09,"It is a world acclaimed author, Andrew Hunter Murray."
00:00:09,00:00:10,"Hello, Andrew."
00:00:10,00:00:11,- Hello.
00:00:11,00:00:12,- You've written a book right here.
00:00:12,00:00:13,"- Yes, I've written a book."
00:00:13,00:00:15,"It's called ""A Beginner's Guide to Breaking and Entering."""
00:00:15,00:00:17,It's out in paperback now.
00:00:17,00:00:19,"- Yes, I've actually read it."
00:00:19,00:00:20,And not even just 'cause I'm friends with him
00:00:20,00:00:23,because it's such a fun read.
00:00:23,00:00:27,And it's actually not a guide to how to break into a house
00:00:27,00:00:29,"and burgle it, which is obviously what I was hoping for."
00:00:29,00:00:31,- It's even better than that.
00:00:31,00:00:32,Tell us about it.
00:00:32,00:00:35,"- Well, it's about a young guy called Al"
00:00:35,00:00:38,"who lives in lovely, empty second homes"
00:00:38,00:00:40,when the real life owners are away.
00:00:40,00:00:42,"He doesn't break things, he doesn't steal things."
00:00:42,00:00:43,"He just makes his way in,"
00:00:43,00:00:45,"lives in these gorgeous places, and then gets out again."
00:00:45,00:00:48,And this book is the story of when he and his friends
00:00:48,00:00:51,"break into the wrong home on the wrong day,"
00:00:51,00:00:53,"someone ends up dead, not his fault,"
00:00:53,00:00:55,and things just get more complicated from there.
00:00:55,00:00:56,It's a caper.
00:00:56,00:00:58,"- It is a plus, a little bit of satire"
00:00:58,00:01:00,"in the housing market, which every good book needs."
00:01:00,00:01:03,And obviously he joins up with a fun motley crew
00:01:03,00:01:04,of fellow breakers and enterers.
00:01:04,00:01:07,It really is such a fun book to read.
00:01:07,00:01:10,"And I believe it's available in bookshops, is that right?"
00:01:10,00:01:12,- It's available in all bookshops.
00:01:12,00:01:14,"And even better, if you're an audio person,"
00:01:14,00:01:17,it's in a two for one deal on Audible.
00:01:17,00:01:18,That and one of my other books the last day
00:01:18,00:01:20,"are both included in the current Audible deal,"
00:01:20,00:01:22,which is lasting a few more days
00:01:22,00:01:25,where you can get two books for one credit.
00:01:25,00:01:28,"- Do it, go, listen to the book and then read the book."
00:01:28,00:01:30,"- Do both, it really is worth it."
00:01:30,00:01:33,"And speaking of guests, we had a fantastic guest on today."
00:01:33,00:01:35,We had so much fun with her in the episode
00:01:35,00:01:36,that you're about to hear.
00:01:36,00:01:39,"It was the excellent comedian Rosie Holt,"
00:01:39,00:01:42,who I'm sure many of you are familiar with.
00:01:42,00:01:44,"And once you've listened to this, if you're in the market"
00:01:44,00:01:47,for some very sharp skewering of what's going on
00:01:47,00:01:50,"in politics today, you have to check out her podcast,"
00:01:50,00:01:52,which is called Non-Censored.
00:01:52,00:01:54,"On the other hand, if what you fancy"
00:01:54,00:01:57,"is a very witty satire on the last government,"
00:01:57,00:02:00,"then check out her book, which is called Why We Were Right."
00:02:00,00:02:03,"So that is Non-Censored, the podcast,"
00:02:03,00:02:05,"or Why We Were Right, the book."
00:02:05,00:02:07,"But for now, enjoy the show."
00:02:07,00:02:09,- On with the podcast.
00:02:09,00:02:11,(jazz music)
00:02:11,00:02:15,(jazz music)
00:02:15,00:02:27,- Hello and welcome to another episode
00:02:27,00:02:29,"of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast"
00:02:29,00:02:32,coming to you from the QI offices in Hoburn.
00:02:32,00:02:33,My name is Dan Schreiber.
00:02:33,00:02:35,"I am sitting here with Anna Tyshinski,"
00:02:35,00:02:38,"Andrew Hunter Murray, and Rosie Holt."
00:02:38,00:02:40,"And once again, we have gathered around the microphones"
00:02:40,00:02:42,with our favorite facts from the last seven days.
00:02:42,00:02:45,"And in no particular order, here we go."
00:02:45,00:02:48,"Starting with fact number one, and that is Rosie."
00:02:48,00:02:51,- My fact this week is all the werewolves
00:02:51,00:02:54,in the film Howling 2 are actually monkeys
00:02:54,00:02:57,because the wrong costumes were delivered.
00:02:57,00:02:59,(laughing)
00:02:59,00:03:01,"- So, so much to unpack here."
00:03:01,00:03:03,"You said Howling 2, like every listener's gonna know."
00:03:03,00:03:07,- Everyone knows about the famous film Howling 2.
00:03:07,00:03:10,I think somewhere Howling 2 was called
00:03:10,00:03:12,the worst sequel of all time.
00:03:12,00:03:14,(laughing)
00:03:14,00:03:16,- Those people clearly never saw Howling 8.
00:03:16,00:03:18,(laughing)
00:03:18,00:03:21,"- And you're a fan, right Rosie?"
00:03:21,00:03:24,"- Sort of, I'm fascinated by it."
00:03:24,00:03:27,"So, I don't wanna spoil too much for people"
00:03:27,00:03:30,"who are really excited about watching Howling 2,"
00:03:30,00:03:32,but it leaves off where Howling 1
00:03:32,00:03:35,(laughing)
00:03:35,00:03:38,"finishes, where spoiler alert,"
00:03:38,00:03:42,the female lead turns into a werewolf and she is killed.
00:03:42,00:03:45,"And at the beginning of Howling 2, it's her funeral."
00:03:45,00:03:49,And the best line ever is where Christopher Liu
00:03:49,00:03:50,"pops up, 'cause why not?"
00:03:50,00:03:54,"And he says, he says, I'm afraid your sister was a werewolf."
00:03:54,00:03:56,"And the guy goes, God damn it,"
00:03:56,00:03:58,that's my sister you're talking about.
00:03:58,00:03:59,(laughing)
00:03:59,00:04:00,- And he says it at the funeral.
00:04:00,00:04:01,- Yes.
00:04:01,00:04:02,"- And he turns over to the funeral,"
00:04:02,00:04:02,no one knows who he is.
00:04:02,00:04:03,He's just a weird guy.
00:04:03,00:04:04,- Just a weird old guy.
00:04:04,00:04:05,- He stands at the back and then says that.
00:04:05,00:04:07,"And you can understand, we haven't led up to,"
00:04:07,00:04:09,"like, did you know there are more things on earth"
00:04:09,00:04:11,"than a dreamt of, you know, like the werewolves exist."
00:04:11,00:04:14,"As far as I can tell, this is fresh news for this guy."
00:04:14,00:04:15,"- No, it's a cold open."
00:04:15,00:04:17,"- I must say, 'cause I think I might be the person on the planet"
00:04:17,00:04:19,who's watched Howling 2 most recently.
00:04:19,00:04:22,- I finished one hour ago and then I came straight
00:04:22,00:04:23,directly here.
00:04:23,00:04:24,(laughing)
00:04:24,00:04:26,And it's really good.
00:04:26,00:04:27,- Watching it with the knowledge of what happened
00:04:27,00:04:29,"with these costumes, it was a mix-up."
00:04:29,00:04:31,They were Planet of the Apes TV series.
00:04:31,00:04:33,"- Oh yeah, that's the costume story."
00:04:33,00:04:35,"- Yeah, so basically, they were sent the costumes."
00:04:35,00:04:36,The costumes were late.
00:04:36,00:04:38,"When they opened the costumes,"
00:04:38,00:04:41,it was actually from the Planet of the Apes TV show.
00:04:41,00:04:44,"And then, good old Christopher Lee saved the day"
00:04:44,00:04:48,"because he said, this is what we're going to do, Philippe,"
00:04:48,00:04:49,that's the director.
00:04:49,00:04:51,We're going to shoot a scene where we simply explain
00:04:51,00:04:54,"that werewolves go through three phases,"
00:04:54,00:04:58,"a human phase, a monkey phase, and then a werewolf phase."
00:04:58,00:04:59,And that will solve everything.
00:04:59,00:05:00,- No.
00:05:00,00:05:01,- And it did. - And it did.
00:05:01,00:05:02,- Yes. - Yeah.
00:05:02,00:05:03,- And that's what they do. - Yeah.
00:05:03,00:05:04,- Pretty much.
00:05:04,00:05:05,- So do they look like monkeys?
00:05:05,00:05:06,- They look exactly like monkeys.
00:05:06,00:05:08,- They look exactly like monkeys from Planet of the Apes.
00:05:08,00:05:09,(laughing)
00:05:09,00:05:10,- It's really confusing.
00:05:10,00:05:12,And they shot it all in the dark.
00:05:12,00:05:14,"And then later on, once they got a werewolf head,"
00:05:14,00:05:17,they spliced in lots of shots of a random werewolf head
00:05:17,00:05:18,crossing a screen.
00:05:18,00:05:19,It's terrific.
00:05:19,00:05:20,It's so good.
00:05:20,00:05:21,"I mean, there's so much in this film."
00:05:21,00:05:22,- Yes.
00:05:22,00:05:23,And there's lots of great little facts.
00:05:23,00:05:24,So the other thing about the costumes
00:05:24,00:05:28,was there's a threesome scene where they're all werewolves
00:05:28,00:05:30,and they're all having sexy fun.
00:05:30,00:05:32,"But if you probably remember, Andrew."
00:05:32,00:05:33,- I remember the scene very well.
00:05:33,00:05:34,- Yes.
00:05:34,00:05:37,"It's not a terribly, I mean, vigorous threesome."
00:05:37,00:05:40,They're sort of tentatively stroking each other
00:05:40,00:05:42,"and growling, and it's because,"
00:05:42,00:05:46,so they'd had to be covered in hair for the costumes.
00:05:46,00:05:48,"And this took, I think this took like eight hours."
00:05:48,00:05:51,"And then they found out that when you touched each other,"
00:05:51,00:05:53,the hair came off.
00:05:53,00:05:53,- Yeah.
00:05:53,00:05:55,- So therefore they were having to not touch each other
00:05:55,00:05:58,"because they realized if they actually did an orgy,"
00:05:58,00:06:01,"well, a film orgy, all their costumes would fall off."
00:06:01,00:06:03,- 'Cause it wasn't a costume.
00:06:03,00:06:06,It was them naked for eight hours with them putting
00:06:06,00:06:08,little bits of hair on them.
00:06:08,00:06:09,"- Oh, was it them naked?"
00:06:09,00:06:09,"Like, yeah."
00:06:09,00:06:10,"- Sorry, I didn't explain that very well."
00:06:10,00:06:12,It would have made more sense to put them
00:06:12,00:06:13,in the monkey costumes for this.
00:06:13,00:06:15,"But I guess they thought because they're sort of naked,"
00:06:15,00:06:16,it's still going to be sexy-ish.
00:06:16,00:06:17,- It's not quite as sexy as the monkey costume.
00:06:17,00:06:18,- Yeah.
00:06:18,00:06:19,- It's the hairiest and most chased three
00:06:19,00:06:20,some ever committed.
00:06:20,00:06:22,- It's a rare double award.
00:06:22,00:06:25,"Rosie, is this one of your favorite films or something?"
00:06:25,00:06:26,"- It's not one of my favorite films,"
00:06:26,00:06:29,but I do have a real soft spot for it.
00:06:29,00:06:30,- 'Cause it's genuinely so bad it's good.
00:06:30,00:06:31,- It is so bad it's good.
00:06:31,00:06:32,"- After the first 10 minutes, I thought,"
00:06:32,00:06:33,"I hope, I can't believe we're going to cover this"
00:06:33,00:06:34,in case someone watches it.
00:06:34,00:06:36,"And now, I say watch it."
00:06:36,00:06:37,- Yeah.
00:06:37,00:06:38,Do you totally?
00:06:38,00:06:39,"- I mean, it has, the weird thing about Christopher Lee"
00:06:39,00:06:42,is that he's a good actor who's only done shit films
00:06:42,00:06:44,"with a few exceptions, obviously."
00:06:44,00:06:46,"- Lord of the Rings, Man with the Golden Gun,"
00:06:46,00:06:47,"The Wicker Man, one of the greatest horror films"
00:06:47,00:06:49,I've ever made.
00:06:49,00:06:50,"- So he's done some good films,"
00:06:50,00:06:53,but he's done a lot of really bad films.
00:06:53,00:06:54,- I think the only reason he did this movie
00:06:54,00:06:56,was 'cause he realized he hadn't done a werewolf movie.
00:06:56,00:06:57,"So he thought, okay."
00:06:57,00:06:58,"- And thought, this is the one."
00:06:58,00:06:59,"- This is the one, howling two."
00:06:59,00:07:01,- This is the one.
00:07:01,00:07:03,- The filming of this one sounds amazing.
00:07:03,00:07:05,"'Cause Christopher Lee, we must have mentioned before,"
00:07:05,00:07:06,is like an amazing character.
00:07:06,00:07:10,"He had this great war past where he worked for the SOE,"
00:07:10,00:07:12,"the special operations executive in the war,"
00:07:12,00:07:15,which was like the secret service under Churchill.
00:07:15,00:07:17,No one really knows what he did there
00:07:17,00:07:19,'cause he was never allowed to talk about it.
00:07:19,00:07:22,But it seems like the one person he confided in
00:07:22,00:07:23,"was the director of this film,"
00:07:23,00:07:25,who was called Philippe Mora.
00:07:25,00:07:27,"- Yeah, 'cause he was a Nazi hunter."
00:07:27,00:07:28,- Yes.
00:07:28,00:07:31,"- But apparently they landed in Czechoslovakia,"
00:07:31,00:07:34,"which it was at the time, where it was being filmed."
00:07:34,00:07:36,And they got to the airport
00:07:36,00:07:39,and there was this huge crowd of people
00:07:39,00:07:40,who were all like cheering and waving
00:07:40,00:07:42,and giving this heroes welcome.
00:07:42,00:07:43,"- Wait, hang on."
00:07:43,00:07:44,"- Yeah, go on."
00:07:44,00:07:45,- Quick query.
00:07:45,00:07:45,- Go.
00:07:45,00:07:48,- He was a super secret war hero and Nazi hunter.
00:07:48,00:07:51,And yet he's so globally famous as a Nazi hunter
00:07:51,00:07:53,that everyone in the Czech Republic
00:07:53,00:07:54,knows who he is at the airport.
00:07:54,00:07:56,"- He must have been like James Bond,"
00:07:56,00:07:57,where he just didn't hide.
00:07:57,00:08:00,- Is that totally plausible?
00:08:00,00:08:03,"- No, no, there were elements of his war past"
00:08:03,00:08:04,that were known at that point.
00:08:04,00:08:06,'Cause it was the 80s by then.
00:08:06,00:08:09,And basically it seemed to be widely accepted
00:08:09,00:08:12,"that as part of his spying war history,"
00:08:12,00:08:15,"he'd been involved in the assassination of Reinhard Heidrich,"
00:08:15,00:08:18,"who was the highest ranking Nazi ever,"
00:08:18,00:08:20,assassinated by the West.
00:08:20,00:08:23,So he landed in Prague and he got this heroes welcome.
00:08:23,00:08:25,"And the director was like, one, do that's for one."
00:08:25,00:08:27,"Christopher Lee was like, I'm gonna stop you there."
00:08:27,00:08:28,It'll be for me.
00:08:28,00:08:31,- For my Nazi killing.
00:08:31,00:08:34,- I have seen a couple of stories saying
00:08:34,00:08:36,did he exaggerate his war record at all?
00:08:36,00:08:38,And I haven't had the time to properly look into them.
00:08:38,00:08:39,And I just hope he didn't.
00:08:39,00:08:40,- I didn't want to be scared to do that.
00:08:40,00:08:42,"- If he got such a heroes welcome,"
00:08:42,00:08:44,surely he didn't exaggerate any of it.
00:08:44,00:08:45,"- Yeah, but it could have been--"
00:08:45,00:08:48,- He was also a globally favoured film star at the time.
00:08:48,00:08:49,They might be showing any old stuff.
00:08:49,00:08:51,- I don't think that's relevant.
00:08:51,00:08:52,I don't think that's what to do with it.
00:08:52,00:08:53,- The checks are above that.
00:08:53,00:08:56,"- But because it was filmed in Czechsvakia,"
00:08:56,00:08:59,"Christopher Lee and Sibyl Daning, was it Sibyl Danning?"
00:08:59,00:09:00,- Yeah.
00:09:00,00:09:02,"- Yeah, they both were getting followed the whole time"
00:09:02,00:09:05,while they were shooting by two creepy men
00:09:05,00:09:06,who would sit in the corner
00:09:06,00:09:07,when they ate in the restaurant in the evening.
00:09:07,00:09:09,- As in like Iron Curtain's bunnies or secret police?
00:09:09,00:09:11,"- Yes, Iron Curtain's smiles."
00:09:11,00:09:13,"- Oh, Iron Curtain's smiles."
00:09:13,00:09:14,"'Cause they did, yeah, they did."
00:09:14,00:09:16,They were making phone calls back home
00:09:16,00:09:18,"and they could hear them in the background,"
00:09:18,00:09:20,just like men breathing and coughing
00:09:20,00:09:22,as they were listening in on the conversations.
00:09:22,00:09:23,"- It's worth it, guys."
00:09:23,00:09:24,Were they that the Soviet Union had?
00:09:24,00:09:25,No wonder it fell apart.
00:09:25,00:09:27,If it didn't have its shit together to stay quiet
00:09:27,00:09:28,"on a phone call, it was just listening."
00:09:28,00:09:29,"- I think they're using the Christopher Lee,"
00:09:29,00:09:33,tell you I'm a Nazi murderer process.
00:09:33,00:09:33,They don't care.
00:09:33,00:09:37,"- The lead actress is Sibyl Danning, as you just said."
00:09:37,00:09:38,"There is a bit of the film,"
00:09:38,00:09:41,a slightly sexy bit where she rips her shirt off.
00:09:41,00:09:44,"It's a very charged scene, you know?"
00:09:44,00:09:46,But she apparently had been asked to do this
00:09:46,00:09:48,in lots of films because she was very attractive
00:09:48,00:09:49,and she was a bit bored of it.
00:09:49,00:09:50,"And she said, ""Do you know what?"
00:09:50,00:09:53,I think I'd like to do just one topless scene
00:09:53,00:09:55,or even one topless shot entirely in this film.
00:09:55,00:09:56,"Is that okay?"""
00:09:56,00:09:58,"And the actress said, ""Yeah, great, great, great."""
00:09:58,00:09:59,"Anyway, she turns out--"
00:09:59,00:10:00,"- So she said, ""I want to be limited to one."""
00:10:00,00:10:03,"- Yes, she just wants to do this once, which happened."
00:10:03,00:10:04,She then turns up to the premiere of the film
00:10:04,00:10:06,"where the credits, the closing sequence of the credits"
00:10:06,00:10:09,uses that shot a further 17 times
00:10:09,00:10:11,for absolutely no reason.
00:10:11,00:10:14,"- Yeah, it just has, on repeat, like exposing her chest."
00:10:14,00:10:15,- No.
00:10:15,00:10:16,- Wow.
00:10:16,00:10:18,- Like a sort of sexy gift.
00:10:18,00:10:22,"- If you give them an inch, they will take a month off."
00:10:22,00:10:24,"- But it's so Mora, the director, back to him for a second,"
00:10:24,00:10:26,he didn't know they were going to do that
00:10:26,00:10:28,"to Danning, the actress."
00:10:28,00:10:29,So he actually--
00:10:29,00:10:30,"- Because they were friends, weren't they?"
00:10:30,00:10:31,- They were friends.
00:10:31,00:10:34,"And he kind of, at the end of the movie,"
00:10:34,00:10:36,they brought in some other people to do a final edit on it.
00:10:36,00:10:39,And part of that edit was throwing in 17 shots
00:10:39,00:10:41,of her topless during the credit sequence.
00:10:41,00:10:42,And he was really pissed off by that.
00:10:42,00:10:44,"So he then goes on, he says,"
00:10:44,00:10:47,"""I want to make Howling 3 because I want to fix"
00:10:47,00:10:49,"""the reputation of what this did."""
00:10:49,00:10:50,- Because of that credit sequence.
00:10:50,00:10:51,"- Well, he was just pissed off."
00:10:51,00:10:53,"- The whole film, I think."
00:10:53,00:10:55,A lot of rehab work on your career.
00:10:55,00:10:57,I don't think the credit sequence is the main problem.
00:10:57,00:10:59,"It's problematic, but it's, woof."
00:10:59,00:11:03,"- Yeah, so Howling 3 sounds amazing."
00:11:03,00:11:05,"Howling 3, the marsupials."
00:11:05,00:11:09,"This then is set in Australia, has no reoccurring characters,"
00:11:09,00:11:12,has no plot that is connected to anything else.
00:11:12,00:11:15,"In it, the humans that are transformed into the Howling"
00:11:15,00:11:17,have pouches like marsupials.
00:11:17,00:11:18,- Amazing.
00:11:18,00:11:20,"- Yeah, it sounds pretty amazing."
00:11:20,00:11:22,"He generally just in praise of Mora,"
00:11:22,00:11:24,"'cause he's an Aussie film director,"
00:11:24,00:11:25,and I'd never heard of him.
00:11:25,00:11:28,But his list of movies is extraordinary.
00:11:28,00:11:30,I'm really obsessed with a movie that he directed
00:11:30,00:11:33,"called ""Teridactile Women"" from Beverly Hills."
00:11:33,00:11:34,"- Wow. - I know, right?"
00:11:34,00:11:36,So listen to the plot.
00:11:36,00:11:39,Paleontologist Dick Chandler discovers a dinosaur egg
00:11:39,00:11:42,prompting an eccentric witch doctor named Salvador Dali
00:11:42,00:11:44,"to put a curse on Chandler's wife, Pixie,"
00:11:44,00:11:48,causing her to slowly transform into a pterodactyl.
00:11:48,00:11:49,"After Pixie lays an egg,"
00:11:49,00:11:52,"Dick tracks down Salvador Dali and apologizes,"
00:11:52,00:11:53,and the curse is lifted.
00:11:53,00:11:54,(laughing)
00:11:54,00:11:56,"Now, Barry Humphries is in this movie."
00:11:56,00:11:58,It's like a proper movie.
00:11:58,00:12:00,I can't wait to see that.
00:12:00,00:12:01,- Barry Humphries.
00:12:01,00:12:03,- Barry Humphries is in it.
00:12:03,00:12:06,"There's a bit where Christopher Lee says in ""Howling 2,"""
00:12:06,00:12:08,"right, there are some sort of King werewolves"
00:12:08,00:12:11,"and Queen werewolves, they cannot be killed with silver."
00:12:11,00:12:13,"This is like, there's an oh no moment, oh no,"
00:12:13,00:12:14,what are we gonna do?
00:12:14,00:12:17,"They just says they can be killed with titanium,"
00:12:17,00:12:19,"which, although a slightly harder method to get hold of,"
00:12:19,00:12:21,was very much easily available at the time.
00:12:21,00:12:23,(laughing)
00:12:23,00:12:24,It's stunning.
00:12:24,00:12:27,- Is that a copyright thing with Bran Stoker's people?
00:12:27,00:12:29,- I have no idea.
00:12:29,00:12:31,"- I read an interview with the director,"
00:12:31,00:12:35,"and he was really so, 'cause it got so panned,"
00:12:35,00:12:37,"and he's so enthusiastic about it,"
00:12:37,00:12:39,"and everything he got asked, he'd go,"
00:12:39,00:12:41,"""Thank you for asking that."""
00:12:41,00:12:43,"And one of the things he said, which I liked,"
00:12:43,00:12:45,"was in the poster, there's Sibyl Danning,"
00:12:45,00:12:47,"she's wearing these sunglasses,"
00:12:47,00:12:49,"which will obviously appear in the movie,"
00:12:49,00:12:51,and that came about 'cause he said that she came along
00:12:51,00:12:53,"and she had conjunctivitis, and they were like,"
00:12:53,00:12:55,"""What, what were we doing?"""
00:12:55,00:12:57,"He was like, ""Don't worry, you're a werewolf,"
00:12:57,00:13:00,and a werewolf can wear sunglasses indoors
00:13:00,00:13:01,"if they want to."""
00:13:01,00:13:02,(laughing)
00:13:02,00:13:06,- And that's what your identity is like the concealed now.
00:13:06,00:13:08,- I read that somewhere that that became
00:13:08,00:13:10,very influential in the movie industry.
00:13:10,00:13:12,"So if you think of the Lost Boys,"
00:13:12,00:13:13,"the vampire movies and so on,"
00:13:13,00:13:14,"they're all wearing glasses,"
00:13:14,00:13:16,"and according to numerous people,"
00:13:16,00:13:17,that was a direct influence.
00:13:17,00:13:19,It suddenly was cool to do it.
00:13:19,00:13:21,- It's hard to imagine this film had any influence.
00:13:21,00:13:23,(laughing)
00:13:23,00:13:24,- I think it might have been the '80s.
00:13:24,00:13:27,"Christopher Lee's in it, it was a proper release."
00:13:27,00:13:29,It's part of a massive franchise.
00:13:29,00:13:29,- Yeah.
00:13:29,00:13:32,- I was just looking at monkey costumes.
00:13:32,00:13:33,- Oh yeah.
00:13:33,00:13:36,- And the gorilla movies used to be a really big thing
00:13:36,00:13:37,in the '20s and '30s.
00:13:37,00:13:40,They were a cultural preoccupation.
00:13:40,00:13:41,I suppose they are now.
00:13:41,00:13:42,"- Why? - Actually, Kong."
00:13:42,00:13:43,- Anything else?
00:13:43,00:13:44,- It's all leading up to King Kong.
00:13:44,00:13:45,"Basically, they started with normal-sized gorillas,"
00:13:45,00:13:49,and then they worked their way up to Kong.
00:13:49,00:13:50,"But we still have loads of Kong stuff now,"
00:13:50,00:13:51,and we're still having plenty of the games.
00:13:51,00:13:54,So this is a permanent societal thing.
00:13:54,00:13:56,"But there was one guy called Charles Gamora,"
00:13:56,00:13:59,who was known as the King of the Gorilla Men
00:13:59,00:14:00,"in the '20s and '30s,"
00:14:00,00:14:02,partly because he had his own suit.
00:14:02,00:14:03,(laughing)
00:14:03,00:14:06,"So any film that needed a gorilla,"
00:14:06,00:14:08,get Charles Gamora on set now.
00:14:08,00:14:11,"And he'd done a bit of, he'd seen,"
00:14:11,00:14:13,he was very convincing in his suit.
00:14:13,00:14:14,"And he was the right sort of height,"
00:14:14,00:14:16,and he looked into the San Diego Zoo
00:14:16,00:14:17,and sort of observed them.
00:14:17,00:14:19,"And so he was trying to do it properly,"
00:14:19,00:14:20,he was trying to go in method.
00:14:20,00:14:23,"Anyway, in 30 years, he was in 43 films,"
00:14:23,00:14:26,39 of which involved him being a gorilla.
00:14:26,00:14:27,- Right.
00:14:27,00:14:28,"- The others, he played two aliens,"
00:14:28,00:14:30,one bear and one cannibal.
00:14:30,00:14:31,- Same suit with bits sewn onto it.
00:14:31,00:14:32,- Same suit.
00:14:32,00:14:33,"- Oh, I don't know."
00:14:33,00:14:34,(laughing)
00:14:34,00:14:35,- It just sounds great.
00:14:35,00:14:36,"He's the one called the Monster and the Girl,"
00:14:36,00:14:39,where a gorilla receives the brain of a man
00:14:39,00:14:40,who is seeking revenge
00:14:40,00:14:42,because he was wrongfully executed.
00:14:42,00:14:43,- Right.
00:14:43,00:14:43,- Yeah.
00:14:43,00:14:45,- The brain goes into the gorilla.
00:14:45,00:14:46,- That's really good.
00:14:46,00:14:48,"- I mean, I really hope Modern Hollywood"
00:14:48,00:14:51,"is still using the, well, he's got a suit."
00:14:51,00:14:52,(laughing)
00:14:52,00:14:55,- Andy Serkis just has a great costume like that.
00:14:55,00:14:58,"- Well, that's how Downey Jr. got Iron Man."
00:14:58,00:14:58,(laughing)
00:14:58,00:15:01,(upbeat music)
00:15:01,00:15:05,"- Okay, it is time for fact number two,"
00:15:05,00:15:06,and that is my fact.
00:15:06,00:15:09,"My fact this week is that the author,"
00:15:09,00:15:12,"Elizabeth Gaskell, died in the middle of saying,"
00:15:12,00:15:16,"""When I am dead, but only got as far as when..."""
00:15:16,00:15:18,(laughing)
00:15:18,00:15:20,"- So, how do people know?"
00:15:20,00:15:21,(laughing)
00:15:21,00:15:23,- This is really interesting.
00:15:23,00:15:24,"She, we should just say very quickly"
00:15:24,00:15:27,"before we get into it, this is Elizabeth Gaskell,"
00:15:27,00:15:29,"Mrs. Gaskell, as she was often known."
00:15:29,00:15:31,She was an English novelist.
00:15:31,00:15:32,She wrote short stories.
00:15:32,00:15:34,"She was a biographer, most famously having written a book"
00:15:34,00:15:36,about Charlotte Bronte.
00:15:36,00:15:36,Maybe we'll get onto that.
00:15:36,00:15:37,"- Although that's certainly not like, you know,"
00:15:37,00:15:39,she's most famously wrote.
00:15:39,00:15:39,"- Yes, it really works in fiction."
00:15:39,00:15:41,"- Yes, Mary Barton."
00:15:41,00:15:43,"- Yes, she was one of our great Victorian novelists."
00:15:43,00:15:46,"- But at the time, she was most famous"
00:15:46,00:15:47,for writing biography.
00:15:47,00:15:49,"- Her obituary basically said,"
00:15:49,00:15:50,"""Charlotte Bronte's biographer dead."""
00:15:50,00:15:51,- Yes.
00:15:51,00:15:52,- When?
00:15:52,00:15:53,"- When, exactly."
00:15:53,00:15:57,"- So, what happened was, this is 1865."
00:15:57,00:15:58,She is 55 years old.
00:15:58,00:16:01,"She's at her home, which is a sort of secret home"
00:16:01,00:16:02,that she's purchased.
00:16:02,00:16:04,"- Yeah, I feel like we'll go into that as that story."
00:16:04,00:16:08,- I'm just leaving some little plot moments as we go along.
00:16:08,00:16:11,"So, she's at her house."
00:16:11,00:16:12,She's sitting with her daughters
00:16:12,00:16:14,"and suddenly she keels over and she dies,"
00:16:14,00:16:16,but she dies mid-anichthote.
00:16:16,00:16:18,And we know what happened
00:16:18,00:16:20,"because of a reverend called Reverend Hawkes,"
00:16:20,00:16:23,"who recounted the story, as was told to him"
00:16:23,00:16:24,by one of the daughters.
00:16:24,00:16:26,"So, she was with her daughters and her son-in-law."
00:16:26,00:16:28,"She was telling a story and she says,"
00:16:28,00:16:30,"""The judge said when,"""
00:16:30,00:16:32,and then that's when she passed away.
00:16:32,00:16:34,"Now, she was telling an anecdote."
00:16:34,00:16:35,"Fortunately, one of the four people there"
00:16:35,00:16:37,"had already heard this anecdote,"
00:16:37,00:16:39,presumably so many times
00:16:39,00:16:41,that they knew exactly what was coming next.
00:16:41,00:16:43,And the line that was meant to come next
00:16:43,00:16:45,"was, ""The judge said, 'When I'm dead,"
00:16:45,00:16:47,"'Lady Crompton can visit Rome.'"""
00:16:47,00:16:49,A classic line.
00:16:49,00:16:51,"- Yes, classic line."
00:16:51,00:16:53,- Everybody laughed.
00:16:53,00:16:57,I think you can see where she was going in the conversation
00:16:57,00:16:58,because a little bit of backstory is
00:16:58,00:17:02,that Justice Crompton had just died.
00:17:02,00:17:04,He was her son-in-law's dad
00:17:04,00:17:05,and I think her son-in-law's present.
00:17:05,00:17:08,"So, the guy she's talking about"
00:17:08,00:17:09,"is the person who said, ""When I am dead."""
00:17:09,00:17:11,"So, I imagine she was going on to say,"
00:17:11,00:17:15,"""So now, lucky lady Crompton can book her flight to Rome."""
00:17:15,00:17:17,"Because, you know, it was relevant."
00:17:17,00:17:18,"It's funny 'cause he is dead,"
00:17:18,00:17:20,so it's got a bit of gallows humor to it.
00:17:20,00:17:22,- You've sort of solved the end of the anecdote.
00:17:22,00:17:24,- I think that's what's happened.
00:17:24,00:17:26,"Yeah, it's like Edwin Drude has finally been revealed."
00:17:26,00:17:27,- Thank God.
00:17:27,00:17:32,"How great, though, to sort of not be lost on that last word."
00:17:32,00:17:34,"Like, we should all practice our final words"
00:17:34,00:17:35,with someone in confidence beforehand
00:17:35,00:17:37,"so that if we do go mid-sentence,"
00:17:37,00:17:39,"I mean, I will be saying something"
00:17:39,00:17:41,I've already said loads of times already
00:17:41,00:17:44,'cause I'm down to a limited stock of anecdotes now.
00:17:44,00:17:45,Just people know my things.
00:17:45,00:17:47,"- Do you think it was a bit of a let down, though,"
00:17:47,00:17:49,"when they said, ""Well, she started by saying"
00:17:49,00:17:51,"""wet,"" and then someone went, ""No, no, actually,"
00:17:51,00:17:53,"""she's told that several times before."""
00:17:53,00:17:56,"- A bit of a bore, actually, Lizzie."
00:17:56,00:17:57,- Always whining about the same stuff.
00:17:57,00:17:58,That's probably why old people
00:17:58,00:18:00,"repeat anecdotes all the time, isn't it?"
00:18:00,00:18:02,"Just to make sure that once they're saying their anecdote,"
00:18:02,00:18:04,that we know where they were going with it.
00:18:04,00:18:06,"- Very wise, yeah. - Yeah, that's very wise."
00:18:06,00:18:07,"- She's, has anyone read this?"
00:18:07,00:18:09,- I've read Mary Barton.
00:18:09,00:18:10,Thank you.
00:18:10,00:18:11,- You've read North and South.
00:18:11,00:18:12,- Thank you.
00:18:12,00:18:13,- I think I've read North and South.
00:18:13,00:18:13,Or Mary Barton.
00:18:13,00:18:15,- Or have you just seen the TV series?
00:18:15,00:18:17,"- No, I'm gonna be a little bit heretical."
00:18:17,00:18:18,I don't think she's all that.
00:18:18,00:18:20,"I mean, she's good."
00:18:20,00:18:22,"They're good novels, but they're very Victorian."
00:18:22,00:18:24,"They're a bit, you know, they haven't aged brilliantly."
00:18:24,00:18:25,"- I think they've got, I think they really have."
00:18:25,00:18:27,I think she's much more radical than people.
00:18:27,00:18:29,"- Yes, that's what I don't like, yeah, yeah."
00:18:29,00:18:33,"- Mary Barton, it's a sort of a working class character,"
00:18:33,00:18:34,"and it's very much in that life,"
00:18:34,00:18:38,"which was, you know, not so much the dumb thing back then."
00:18:38,00:18:39,- I completely agree.
00:18:39,00:18:42,"I think, like, her and Dickens are two people"
00:18:42,00:18:44,who really engage with people
00:18:44,00:18:46,"who are having a shit old time in life,"
00:18:46,00:18:48,"more than almost any other Victorian novelist, you know,"
00:18:48,00:18:51,"'cause they're all about factory workers,"
00:18:51,00:18:55,the strife between bosses and laborers.
00:18:55,00:18:56,"Not into that though, are you, Andy?"
00:18:56,00:18:57,- I like reading about aristocrats
00:18:57,00:18:59,with minor social problems.
00:18:59,00:19:00,(all laughing)
00:19:00,00:19:02,That's my thing.
00:19:02,00:19:03,- 'Cause she did write about that stuff.
00:19:03,00:19:04,"It was really controversial, wasn't it?"
00:19:04,00:19:07,"And in her community as well, particularly,"
00:19:07,00:19:09,"where she was representing these characters,"
00:19:09,00:19:12,"'cause I believe I actually haven't read any of her stuff,"
00:19:12,00:19:15,but it sounds as if the other writers of the time
00:19:15,00:19:16,"who were in the same field,"
00:19:16,00:19:19,"so Bronte, a friend of hers, Austin,"
00:19:19,00:19:21,"they would write about a period slightly gone,"
00:19:21,00:19:23,"whereas she was writing in the present,"
00:19:23,00:19:25,"and then that, so that was a bit more controversial."
00:19:25,00:19:26,And there's a few books.
00:19:26,00:19:27,"She had one book called ""Ruth,"""
00:19:27,00:19:29,"which was very controversial,"
00:19:29,00:19:32,and they actually burnt copies in her local church.
00:19:32,00:19:33,"- Yes, members of her own church."
00:19:33,00:19:34,"- Yeah, which is. - Which is."
00:19:34,00:19:35,- Why did they do that?
00:19:35,00:19:36,- 'Cause it was debauched.
00:19:36,00:19:38,- It's about a fallen woman.
00:19:38,00:19:39,"- Oh, yes, they should be about."
00:19:39,00:19:42,- I know how it's a threesome scene actually.
00:19:42,00:19:44,Wolfs dressed as gorillas.
00:19:44,00:19:46,"- That's what fallen women do, yes."
00:19:46,00:19:48,- Gascall wasn't allowed into her husband's library.
00:19:48,00:19:50,He had to get books out for her.
00:19:50,00:19:52,It's very weird.
00:19:52,00:19:52,- Really? - Yeah.
00:19:52,00:19:54,"- Local library, not like his personal."
00:19:54,00:19:56,"Like, no, not his, she was allowed,"
00:19:56,00:19:59,"she was allowed the run of the house at home,"
00:19:59,00:19:59,"but no, he was a member of the library."
00:19:59,00:20:01,"- She wasn't allowed his library, like Bluebeard."
00:20:01,00:20:02,- What's that?
00:20:02,00:20:04,"- You know the tell of Bluebeard,"
00:20:04,00:20:06,"where he marries this young woman,"
00:20:06,00:20:08,"and he says, ""You can go in any room you like,"
00:20:08,00:20:10,"""except for this one."""
00:20:10,00:20:12,- You're talking about Beauty and the Beast.
00:20:12,00:20:14,"- No, I'm not talking about Bluebeard."
00:20:14,00:20:15,- Are you talking about the pirate?
00:20:15,00:20:16,- What's in the room?
00:20:16,00:20:16,"- No, everybody."
00:20:16,00:20:17,- Kurt Vonnegut novel?
00:20:17,00:20:20,"- No, it's a very famous tale that none of you have heard of."
00:20:20,00:20:21,"- I think I know what's in the room,"
00:20:21,00:20:23,"but you say it, you say it, what's in the room?"
00:20:23,00:20:26,"- So she finally, 'cause he keeps going away,"
00:20:26,00:20:28,"so she's wandering around all these rooms,"
00:20:28,00:20:29,and she gets impatient.
00:20:29,00:20:32,"She goes, ""I just want to know what's in the mystery room."""
00:20:32,00:20:34,So she uses the skeleton key.
00:20:34,00:20:36,"I think it's the skeleton key, maybe I've embellished that."
00:20:36,00:20:38,"And she opens it,"
00:20:38,00:20:41,and inside are all the dead bodies of his previous wife.
00:20:41,00:20:42,- Oh!
00:20:42,00:20:47,"- Don't draw attention to it, you idiot man."
00:20:47,00:20:48,"But then he comes back, and he goes,"
00:20:48,00:20:51,"""Oh dear, looks like I'm gonna have to kill you too,"
00:20:51,00:20:52,"""because you opened the door."""
00:20:52,00:20:54,- Another notch in the skeleton key.
00:20:54,00:20:56,"- Yes, and the other notch is going to escape."
00:20:56,00:20:58,"- Yes, it's a funny old story, isn't it?"
00:20:58,00:20:59,- Where's it from?
00:20:59,00:21:00,- Is it an author we know?
00:21:00,00:21:02,Is it almost like a photo?
00:21:02,00:21:05,"- No, it's very old, it's a very old tale."
00:21:05,00:21:06,"- Right, I can't."
00:21:06,00:21:08,"- That wasn't the case in Gaskell's husband's library,"
00:21:08,00:21:09,as far as I know.
00:21:09,00:21:11,"- Well, you don't know, because no one went in there."
00:21:11,00:21:12,- That's true.
00:21:12,00:21:13,"- But the thing about her,"
00:21:13,00:21:16,"I think which kind of annoys people or bores at them,"
00:21:16,00:21:18,is that she actually was really normal.
00:21:18,00:21:18,And the thing that's quite nice about her
00:21:18,00:21:20,is that she just basically had a really happy life.
00:21:20,00:21:23,"She was quite conventional in how she lived, you know?"
00:21:23,00:21:24,She married this vicar.
00:21:24,00:21:26,"- Wait, or was she?"
00:21:26,00:21:30,"- Or what, do you know the hidden history of her orgies?"
00:21:30,00:21:31,(laughing)
00:21:31,00:21:32,The mass orgies.
00:21:32,00:21:35,"- Well, wasn't there a rumour going round when she died"
00:21:35,00:21:38,that she and her husband were separated?
00:21:38,00:21:41,And that's why she was in the separate house.
00:21:41,00:21:44,"- Well, I do think that that's got weight."
00:21:44,00:21:46,So I'm glad other people who aren't gossips like me
00:21:46,00:21:48,"have said it, because I'm not a gossip."
00:21:48,00:21:51,"- I only bring the fat, you're an intellectual."
00:21:51,00:21:54,"- So separate house, she bought her own house."
00:21:54,00:21:55,"- The house she dies in, yes."
00:21:55,00:21:57,- Without telling her husband.
00:21:57,00:21:59,"- And the story is that it was a surprise for her husband,"
00:21:59,00:22:01,like a retirement home.
00:22:01,00:22:02,"Oh, we're going to move to the country,"
00:22:02,00:22:04,"this lovely mansion, and she was in the house"
00:22:04,00:22:05,"with all her daughters saying,"
00:22:05,00:22:07,isn't daddy going to be delighted?
00:22:07,00:22:08,But I agree it's a bit--
00:22:08,00:22:09,- So all the children are there as well?
00:22:09,00:22:12,"- Yeah, I mean, which is why slightly the story suggests"
00:22:12,00:22:14,that that is what was going on.
00:22:14,00:22:17,But is he at home at the breakfast table at the house?
00:22:17,00:22:19,"Well, I think it's very quiet this morning, isn't it?"
00:22:19,00:22:21,"- God, they're sleeping in today."
00:22:21,00:22:23,I bet they were separated.
00:22:23,00:22:24,"- Okay, do you reckon?"
00:22:24,00:22:25,"- Yeah, I think so."
00:22:25,00:22:28,- Or it was a secret death house.
00:22:28,00:22:30,Sorry.
00:22:30,00:22:32,She thought my time is up.
00:22:32,00:22:36,I like how animals like to go and die under a log
00:22:36,00:22:37,or something.
00:22:37,00:22:39,She thought I'm going to die in a house
00:22:39,00:22:42,"that's a huge faff to buy a full house, isn't it?"
00:22:42,00:22:43,"- Yeah, but houses are cheaper then."
00:22:43,00:22:46,I think it was probably easier to do.
00:22:46,00:22:49,"A few years ago, a university got a collection of letters"
00:22:49,00:22:50,that were written by someone who was friends
00:22:50,00:22:52,with Elizabeth Gaskell and they were having correspondence
00:22:52,00:22:56,"and in it, Gaskell predicted her death that year."
00:22:56,00:22:57,"She said to her, I'm not going to make it"
00:22:57,00:22:58,to the end of the year.
00:22:58,00:22:59,- So I'd better buy a house.
00:22:59,00:23:02,"- Yeah, but perhaps she didn't know"
00:23:02,00:23:04,that she was doing so well.
00:23:04,00:23:05,She could sense it.
00:23:05,00:23:08,- There is an argument in Gaskell's life.
00:23:08,00:23:09,"So the house, the secret house that she bought"
00:23:09,00:23:13,"was in Alton, in Hampshire, which is where--"
00:23:13,00:23:14,"- Jane Austen lived, yeah."
00:23:14,00:23:16,- For the last years of her life.
00:23:16,00:23:17,"- And Alton Towers, is that there?"
00:23:17,00:23:18,"- No, it's in a completely different place."
00:23:18,00:23:20,It's hundreds of miles away.
00:23:20,00:23:24,"But Gaskell grew up in Stratford-upon-Avon,"
00:23:24,00:23:25,home of--
00:23:25,00:23:27,- Shakespeare.
00:23:27,00:23:28,- So is this a lay line?
00:23:28,00:23:30,- You guys weren't quick enough.
00:23:30,00:23:31,(laughing)
00:23:31,00:23:33,- So is this an argument for lay lines
00:23:33,00:23:35,"in terms of literary creativity, probably?"
00:23:35,00:23:36,"- There's certainly something going on, isn't there?"
00:23:36,00:23:38,"- Yeah, certainly, I think."
00:23:38,00:23:40,"Do you know she gave us the word ""squiffy"" to mean drunk?"
00:23:40,00:23:41,- Really?
00:23:41,00:23:42,"- Oh, brilliant."
00:23:42,00:23:44,"I know, I love that fact."
00:23:44,00:23:45,"- I love the sound of her, I have to say."
00:23:45,00:23:48,"As in, when you read about her social life,"
00:23:48,00:23:50,"there is this comparison, I think, with Dickens,"
00:23:50,00:23:52,where Dickens was partying all the time.
00:23:52,00:23:53,He was everywhere.
00:23:53,00:23:55,He went around the world.
00:23:55,00:23:56,That's exactly what Gaskell did
00:23:56,00:23:58,in a time where it felt like
00:23:58,00:23:59,that would have been much harder.
00:23:59,00:24:01,She was a mother of how many children
00:24:01,00:24:01,did she have in total?
00:24:01,00:24:02,- Five.
00:24:02,00:24:03,- I think she was pregnant seven times.
00:24:03,00:24:04,A couple of the children didn't live.
00:24:04,00:24:05,"- Okay, right."
00:24:05,00:24:07,"Five daughters and one son, yeah, survived,"
00:24:07,00:24:08,which is quite a lot.
00:24:08,00:24:09,"- That is, yeah."
00:24:09,00:24:11,"She was writing, she wrote quite a few novels,"
00:24:11,00:24:13,"a lot of short stories, a biography."
00:24:13,00:24:14,She traveled the world.
00:24:14,00:24:17,She was constantly said to be dancing
00:24:17,00:24:18,half the night at parties.
00:24:18,00:24:19,She was a real socialite.
00:24:19,00:24:21,I think she sounds really fun.
00:24:21,00:24:22,- I think you would have gotten along with her very well.
00:24:22,00:24:24,"- Yeah, it feels like it. - It was a real butterfly."
00:24:24,00:24:26,- She even wrote one of her novels
00:24:26,00:24:27,while she was staying with Florence Nightingale.
00:24:27,00:24:30,"Like, she just touches all these little elements"
00:24:30,00:24:32,"of the past, which I really love."
00:24:32,00:24:34,- She sounds like someone who deserves
00:24:34,00:24:35,to have been let in the library.
00:24:35,00:24:36,- Yeah. - Yeah.
00:24:36,00:24:37,- I don't know though.
00:24:37,00:24:38,- I know.
00:24:38,00:24:38,"- It's a slippery slope, isn't it?"
00:24:38,00:24:41,- I think she should have been allowed in that library.
00:24:41,00:24:43,"- You let them in libraries one day, you know, the next day."
00:24:43,00:24:45,- They just go in there willy-nilly.
00:24:45,00:24:45,"- Yeah, exactly."
00:24:45,00:24:47,- It's like getting squiffy.
00:24:47,00:24:49,- I have another theory about her
00:24:49,00:24:51,that I think we should spread this gossip.
00:24:51,00:24:53,"Her brother, John, and have you read about him?"
00:24:53,00:24:55,He was seven years older than her.
00:24:55,00:24:57,"So she had, her mom died when she was one"
00:24:57,00:24:59,and she was sent to live with an aunt who she loved
00:24:59,00:25:02,and she lived in this very female dominated community.
00:25:02,00:25:03,It was all women.
00:25:03,00:25:05,But she did have this older brother
00:25:05,00:25:06,who still lived with her dad and they wrote
00:25:06,00:25:09,to each other a lot and he was really fond of her.
00:25:09,00:25:11,And then he joined the merchant navy
00:25:11,00:25:13,and they kept writing to each other.
00:25:13,00:25:15,And then he just vanishes.
00:25:15,00:25:17,And everyone says he was either abducted by pirates
00:25:17,00:25:20,in India or his ship sank.
00:25:20,00:25:23,"But she, after writing the years, she's 17."
00:25:23,00:25:24,- Yeah.
00:25:24,00:25:26,(laughing)
00:25:26,00:25:28,"- Bluebeard, yes, kidnapped."
00:25:28,00:25:31,"- A bluebeard and a blackbeard, brothers or friends,"
00:25:31,00:25:33,they must know each other.
00:25:33,00:25:35,- They're naughty cousins.
00:25:35,00:25:37,(laughing)
00:25:37,00:25:41,"- So, yes, it's vicious."
00:25:41,00:25:42,And she never mentioned it.
00:25:42,00:25:45,"She never mentioned him to her kids except to say,"
00:25:45,00:25:46,"""Oh, I don't really remember him."""
00:25:46,00:25:47,- Really?
00:25:47,00:25:48,- Of course you'd remember him.
00:25:48,00:25:49,- Too painful or?
00:25:49,00:25:50,"- Well, I don't know."
00:25:50,00:25:51,- What's your theory?
00:25:51,00:25:53,"You seem to be driving at something here, Anna."
00:25:53,00:25:53,- I think-
00:25:53,00:25:54,- Is he in the library?
00:25:54,00:25:58,- I think his corpse was on the shelves.
00:25:58,00:26:00,I think maybe he ran away with like an Indian lady
00:26:00,00:26:03,and told only her and she can never tell anyone.
00:26:03,00:26:04,- That's a good theory.
00:26:04,00:26:05,"- Yeah, I like that."
00:26:05,00:26:07,- Just on people who wrote anonymously.
00:26:07,00:26:11,"'Cause Gaskell was always, by a lady,"
00:26:11,00:26:13,would appear on her title pages.
00:26:13,00:26:15,I think she was Mrs. Gaskell later in her career.
00:26:15,00:26:18,But I didn't really realize how common this was.
00:26:18,00:26:22,"So between 1750 and 1790, 80% of all novels"
00:26:22,00:26:25,did not list an author on the title page.
00:26:25,00:26:28,"Male and female writers, it just wasn't a thing."
00:26:28,00:26:31,"For women, it was because it was a bit risqué"
00:26:31,00:26:31,to be writing a novel.
00:26:31,00:26:33,"It was too similar to prostitution,"
00:26:33,00:26:36,"which I mean, that's genuinely the theory I wrote."
00:26:36,00:26:38,But by a lady was a good phrase to use
00:26:38,00:26:40,because it showed that the author
00:26:40,00:26:42,was someone of a decent class.
00:26:42,00:26:45,So Jane Austen was by a lady
00:26:45,00:26:47,and then later on by the same lady
00:26:47,00:26:49,who brought you sense and sensibility.
00:26:49,00:26:50,I was genuinely at that.
00:26:50,00:26:53,"And she never saw her own name on a title page, Jane Austen."
00:26:53,00:26:54,She's kind of tragic.
00:26:54,00:26:56,"- Yeah, it's sad."
00:26:56,00:26:57,Do you think other books at the time
00:26:57,00:26:59,were written by a different lady?
00:26:59,00:27:00,(all laughing)
00:27:00,00:27:01,- Not that lady.
00:27:01,00:27:03,I can't believe it's not a lady.
00:27:03,00:27:04,Yeah.
00:27:04,00:27:07,"But all of it, like Tristan Shandy, Byron stuff,"
00:27:07,00:27:09,"Jonathan Swift, it's all anonymous."
00:27:09,00:27:10,"- Really? - Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:27:10,00:27:12,"- 'Cause the novel was quite new then, wasn't it?"
00:27:12,00:27:13,"Maybe it was still a bit like,"
00:27:13,00:27:15,"oh, this might not go down very well in history."
00:27:15,00:27:16,"- It was risqué, definitely."
00:27:16,00:27:18,And it was quite fun as well.
00:27:18,00:27:20,"So Jonathan Swift, he sent his stuff"
00:27:20,00:27:22,to a publisher via someone else.
00:27:22,00:27:24,So there was no way of tracing it back to him.
00:27:24,00:27:26,"- Really? - Yeah, yeah."
00:27:26,00:27:27,"- And then when the printer said,"
00:27:27,00:27:29,"""Look, who is the author of 'Gulliver's Travels'?"""
00:27:29,00:27:30,"Swift and his friend, Alexander Pope,"
00:27:30,00:27:33,"they pretended, ""I don't know, I don't know who wrote this."""
00:27:33,00:27:35,"They would even write letters to each other privately,"
00:27:35,00:27:37,"saying, ""Who wrote this 'Gulliver's Travels' book?"""
00:27:37,00:27:39,Completely between themselves.
00:27:39,00:27:41,"- Yeah. - ""I don't know."
00:27:41,00:27:42,"It's so funny."""
00:27:42,00:27:43,"They just, it was a bit of a game, you know?"
00:27:43,00:27:45,- But was there a royalty thing
00:27:45,00:27:47,that they would still have in place?
00:27:47,00:27:49,"- Yeah, I guess you could be paid anonymously"
00:27:49,00:27:50,quite easily at the time.
00:27:50,00:27:53,"- There's just one person who's called like Anna Lady,"
00:27:53,00:27:57,who's just funneling all the money accidentally sent out.
00:27:57,00:27:59,(laughing)
00:27:59,00:28:02,- Gaskell obviously gave all her money to her husband
00:28:02,00:28:05,"at first, and in fact, I think it went to him automatically"
00:28:05,00:28:07,'cause married women weren't allowed to earn money.
00:28:07,00:28:10,"- You really don't approve of this husband, I tell you."
00:28:10,00:28:12,He came from his library.
00:28:12,00:28:15,- Apparently it was very affectionate.
00:28:15,00:28:17,I was listening to a--
00:28:17,00:28:19,- And that's why she bought a secret house.
00:28:19,00:28:20,(laughing)
00:28:20,00:28:21,- I think it was a little joke.
00:28:21,00:28:23,He was the one who suggested she write
00:28:23,00:28:25,to get over the death of her one-year-old son
00:28:25,00:28:27,"who very sadly died, and he said,"
00:28:27,00:28:29,"""As to help you with grieving, write a novel."""
00:28:29,00:28:31,Probably not suspecting she was gonna become
00:28:31,00:28:32,a world famous novelist.
00:28:32,00:28:35,"And yes, when she got paid, it went straight to him,"
00:28:35,00:28:37,"and he sort of jokely pocketed it saying,"
00:28:37,00:28:39,"""Well, you know, women shouldn't be earning"
00:28:39,00:28:41,"""or in control of the purse strings, should they?"
00:28:41,00:28:42,"""I'll give you some pocket money."""
00:28:42,00:28:44,But I think it was all meant--
00:28:44,00:28:45,- Was he saying that?
00:28:45,00:28:46,"- All meant to Jess, too."
00:28:46,00:28:48,It was all meant to Jess.
00:28:48,00:28:49,- It was a different time.
00:28:49,00:28:51,"It's so hard to know when it's written, isn't it?"
00:28:51,00:28:52,You didn't know the tone.
00:28:52,00:28:55,"- Yeah, they needed more emojis, I think."
00:28:55,00:28:57,(laughing)
00:28:57,00:28:59,- How much of history would be different
00:28:59,00:29:00,if emojis existed?
00:29:00,00:29:02,(laughing)
00:29:02,00:29:03,"- I have nothing to offer but blood,"
00:29:03,00:29:04,"toil, tears, and sweat."
00:29:04,00:29:05,Winky.
00:29:05,00:29:07,(laughing)
00:29:07,00:29:09,(upbeat music)
00:29:09,00:29:14,"- Okay, it is time for fact number three,"
00:29:14,00:29:15,and that is Anna.
00:29:15,00:29:18,- My fact this week is that one of Ovid's tips
00:29:18,00:29:20,for seducing a woman you fancied
00:29:20,00:29:23,was to pretend you'd seen dust on her cleavage
00:29:23,00:29:25,and then go to brush it off.
00:29:25,00:29:26,"- It's a great line, isn't it?"
00:29:26,00:29:29,"Oh, you've got a very dusty cleavage."
00:29:29,00:29:29,(laughing)
00:29:29,00:29:31,It's what every woman wants to hear.
00:29:31,00:29:31,- Yeah.
00:29:31,00:29:34,"- Anna, when you say go to brush it off,"
00:29:34,00:29:35,follow through and actually brush it off?
00:29:35,00:29:36,"- Follow through, yes."
00:29:36,00:29:38,So these were his exact words.
00:29:38,00:29:39,- Follow.
00:29:39,00:29:41,- Go to and then complete the brush.
00:29:41,00:29:41,- Complete.
00:29:41,00:29:44,"- Do you think it's like an updated thing of the,"
00:29:44,00:29:46,"no, sorry, a down-dated thing?"
00:29:46,00:29:47,(laughing)
00:29:47,00:29:49,"Because now it's, if you've got an eyelash,"
00:29:49,00:29:51,"oh, you've got an eyelash on your cheek, isn't it?"
00:29:51,00:29:54,And then the man like removes the eyelash.
00:29:54,00:29:55,"- You know this man, come on."
00:29:55,00:29:57,- I have a pocket full of eyelashes
00:29:57,00:29:59,that I try and subtly sprinkle onto people's cheeks.
00:29:59,00:30:00,"- Yeah, that's true."
00:30:00,00:30:01,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:30:01,00:30:03,"- Absolute classic, absolute classic."
00:30:03,00:30:04,- Have you had that tried on you?
00:30:04,00:30:05,"Is that, does it work?"
00:30:05,00:30:07,"- Oh, you've got an eyelash on your..."
00:30:07,00:30:08,(laughing)
00:30:08,00:30:10,And then they lift it off your face.
00:30:10,00:30:12,- What harm is that eyelash doing there?
00:30:12,00:30:14,"- And then they go take a, make a wish."
00:30:14,00:30:15,So maybe it's the same.
00:30:15,00:30:17,"It was like, take you, you've got some dust"
00:30:17,00:30:18,on your cleavage.
00:30:18,00:30:21,"And then they hold it out going, make a wish."
00:30:21,00:30:23,- Blow on it like a dandelion.
00:30:23,00:30:26,I think this book of ours might contain a lot of things
00:30:26,00:30:27,that you guys could try out.
00:30:27,00:30:29,And I'd love to hear the results.
00:30:29,00:30:31,"So this is a book called ""Ars Amatoria"""
00:30:31,00:30:33,and Ovid was a Roman writer.
00:30:33,00:30:36,He wrote this in year two AD.
00:30:36,00:30:37,- And it got in early.
00:30:37,00:30:38,- Box fresh.
00:30:38,00:30:42,"- It got in early, so couple of millennia ago."
00:30:42,00:30:44,"His exact words were, as often happens,"
00:30:44,00:30:47,"if perchance, a little dust should fall"
00:30:47,00:30:48,"on the bosom of the fair,"
00:30:48,00:30:50,it must be brushed off with your fingers.
00:30:50,00:30:52,"And if there should be no dust,"
00:30:52,00:30:55,still brush off that none.
00:30:55,00:30:57,- It would work for me.
00:30:57,00:30:59,(laughing)
00:30:59,00:31:01,I'd like it.
00:31:01,00:31:03,- He has so much good stuff in there.
00:31:03,00:31:05,"Oh, he also said, ""Let it be your object"
00:31:05,00:31:08,"to please the husband of the fair one that you fancy."""
00:31:08,00:31:10,I suppose we're assuming.
00:31:10,00:31:12,"- Oh, this is naughty."
00:31:12,00:31:13,"- Because once made a friend,"
00:31:13,00:31:16,he will be more serviceable for your designs.
00:31:16,00:31:19,So I think you'll get invitations to the house
00:31:19,00:31:20,a little bit more.
00:31:20,00:31:23,- Not like come in and have a hairy threesome.
00:31:23,00:31:23,- No.
00:31:23,00:31:25,"- No, he did specify that."
00:31:25,00:31:26,(laughing)
00:31:26,00:31:30,- Specify no bad gorilla costumes and no threesome.
00:31:30,00:31:34,"- I mean, he was a very risque writer at the time."
00:31:34,00:31:36,"He was, what's the word?"
00:31:36,00:31:39,"He was not evicted, he was deported."
00:31:39,00:31:40,- Yeah.
00:31:40,00:31:41,- He was banned.
00:31:41,00:31:41,- Exiled.
00:31:41,00:31:44,- Exiled to the worst place in the world at the time.
00:31:44,00:31:47,He claimed seems to have been a completely normal city
00:31:47,00:31:48,"in modern day Romania,"
00:31:48,00:31:50,"but compared with Rome, I guess it was rubbish."
00:31:50,00:31:51,- Okay.
00:31:51,00:31:53,"- And for the last 10 years of his life,"
00:31:53,00:31:55,"he spent there writing the ""Tristii"","
00:31:55,00:31:58,"which were basically sad letters saying,"
00:31:58,00:31:59,"""Please can I come back to Rome?"""
00:31:59,00:32:02,"To everyone he knew in Rome, including the emperor."
00:32:02,00:32:03,"But I think he was evicted because he was,"
00:32:03,00:32:04,"he was quite a libidness,"
00:32:04,00:32:05,"quite a licentious writer,"
00:32:05,00:32:07,"lots of sexy stuff in the Ars Amatoria,"
00:32:07,00:32:09,"lots of love poetry,"
00:32:09,00:32:12,but it's quite mysterious why he was actually kicked out.
00:32:12,00:32:12,"- Yeah, we don't know."
00:32:12,00:32:14,- No one knows for sure.
00:32:14,00:32:15,- There might have been a scandal
00:32:15,00:32:18,"involving the daughter of the emperor, Augustus."
00:32:18,00:32:19,"- Yeah, Junior."
00:32:19,00:32:20,I think maybe it was the scandal.
00:32:20,00:32:22,- It might have been a general back-to-basics campaign
00:32:22,00:32:23,"that Augustus was running,"
00:32:23,00:32:25,'cause Rome was getting a little bit CD
00:32:25,00:32:27,and Augustus didn't really like that.
00:32:27,00:32:28,And he was trying to raise public morals a bit
00:32:28,00:32:30,"and Ovid was stood out there saying,"
00:32:30,00:32:32,"""Get Dustin"", you know, all of that."
00:32:32,00:32:34,So it's really unclear why he was.
00:32:34,00:32:35,- Get Dustin.
00:32:35,00:32:36,(all laughing)
00:32:36,00:32:37,- Bang!
00:32:37,00:32:41,"- Man for some Dustin, these ladies."
00:32:41,00:32:43,"- So there were three volumes of this book, right?"
00:32:43,00:32:45,"The Art of Love, first one, which teaches the reader"
00:32:45,00:32:47,how to seduce a woman.
00:32:47,00:32:50,"The second one then is, okay, okay, you've got her."
00:32:50,00:32:52,"Now, how do you continue to seduce her?"
00:32:52,00:32:53,Which is very interesting.
00:32:53,00:32:56,"And then the third one is how for women,"
00:32:56,00:32:57,"so there must have been feedback going,"
00:32:57,00:32:59,"""Hey, this is all very man-based."
00:32:59,00:33:01,"Can we get the opposite version?"""
00:33:01,00:33:03,"So he wrote, ""How a woman can seduce a man."""
00:33:03,00:33:06,"But the fourth volume, which is a separate book,"
00:33:06,00:33:07,is the most exciting one.
00:33:07,00:33:08,- The Marsupials.
00:33:08,00:33:09,"- Yeah, lover."
00:33:09,00:33:10,(all laughing)
00:33:10,00:33:12,- Develop a pouch in your front.
00:33:12,00:33:13,(all laughing)
00:33:13,00:33:16,- Remedia Amoris.
00:33:16,00:33:19,"This is the book of how if it's unrequited love,"
00:33:19,00:33:20,do you stop loving a person?
00:33:20,00:33:23,What a great idea for a book.
00:33:23,00:33:24,- It's a terrific sequel.
00:33:24,00:33:24,- It's fantastic.
00:33:24,00:33:26,- The publishers must have been absolutely chuffed.
00:33:26,00:33:28,"It's got great advice in it as well, the Remedia."
00:33:28,00:33:30,"There's, ""Join the Army."""
00:33:30,00:33:31,"- Oh, boom."
00:33:31,00:33:33,- Become a lawyer.
00:33:33,00:33:34,Become a farmer.
00:33:34,00:33:35,Get a hobby.
00:33:35,00:33:38,- How is this supposed to get you out of unrequited love?
00:33:38,00:33:40,"- I think it's when your heart broken,"
00:33:40,00:33:41,it's how to get over it.
00:33:41,00:33:42,- It's distraction.
00:33:42,00:33:45,- It's not like my dad gave me some advice
00:33:45,00:33:46,once when I was a teenager
00:33:46,00:33:48,and I was very heartbroken over a boy
00:33:48,00:33:49,who did not love me back.
00:33:49,00:33:54,"And my dad said, ""Just picture him on the loo."""
00:33:54,00:33:55,"- Oh, wow."
00:33:55,00:33:56,- Really?
00:33:56,00:33:57,- I can see that going in there.
00:33:57,00:33:59,"- Well, there is a similar-ish thing."
00:33:59,00:34:00,"- Yeah, it is."
00:34:00,00:34:01,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:34:01,00:34:02,Did it work?
00:34:02,00:34:03,"- No, and I said to Dad,"
00:34:03,00:34:07,"'cause he said, ""I was in love with Sarah."""
00:34:07,00:34:08,I can't remember her's name.
00:34:08,00:34:10,There's a girl he was in love with when he was a teenager.
00:34:10,00:34:11,"And he said, ""And I..."""
00:34:11,00:34:12,- I'm gonna shout at her right now.
00:34:12,00:34:13,(all laughing)
00:34:13,00:34:15,"- Cleveland, Sarah Cleveland."
00:34:15,00:34:16,"- Oh, thank God, great."
00:34:16,00:34:17,"Now we're legally secure, yeah."
00:34:17,00:34:19,- So I was in love with Sarah Cleveland
00:34:19,00:34:22,and I would picture her on the loo to get me over her.
00:34:22,00:34:23,"And I said, ""Did it work?"""
00:34:23,00:34:24,"And he went, ""No."""
00:34:24,00:34:25,- Right.
00:34:25,00:34:26,"- If anything, I developed a weird fetish"
00:34:26,00:34:28,that has dawned my life ever since.
00:34:28,00:34:30,(all laughing)
00:34:30,00:34:32,"- Well, okay, well, Ovid wrote,"
00:34:32,00:34:35,"""Maybe this would have worked alternatively."""
00:34:35,00:34:36,And this is about if you're a man
00:34:36,00:34:38,"and you had your heart broken by a woman,"
00:34:38,00:34:41,"go and see her unannounced, right?"
00:34:41,00:34:41,- Early in the morning.
00:34:41,00:34:42,- When she hasn't got her makeup on.
00:34:42,00:34:44,- When she hasn't got her makeup on.
00:34:44,00:34:45,And you'll be reminded.
00:34:45,00:34:46,- She's got two.
00:34:46,00:34:46,(all laughing)
00:34:46,00:34:49,"- She does, don't I claim it?"
00:34:49,00:34:51,- They need a broom to get that out of love.
00:34:51,00:34:52,(all laughing)
00:34:52,00:34:56,"- Yeah, he also, the classic kind of like teenage movie"
00:34:56,00:34:59,techniques burn all the items that are associated with them.
00:34:59,00:35:01,"So sit with a fire and throw the letters in,"
00:35:01,00:35:04,the love letters and the bits of clothing
00:35:04,00:35:06,or whatever's been left over in your house.
00:35:06,00:35:08,"Do that and, but what a great book."
00:35:08,00:35:10,What a forward thinking book.
00:35:10,00:35:12,"- He had to, yes, there are some ropey bits of it."
00:35:12,00:35:14,"Maybe it doesn't stand up to a lot of feminism,"
00:35:14,00:35:16,"but he was a very pro makeup, actually."
00:35:16,00:35:19,He wrote a whole separate book on why women
00:35:19,00:35:21,should wear makeup because there was a lot of pushback
00:35:21,00:35:24,in society at the time about how women were
00:35:24,00:35:26,overdressing their faces with makeup.
00:35:26,00:35:27,"- Augustus, back to basics."
00:35:27,00:35:29,Let's take off that thick slap.
00:35:29,00:35:30,- Exactly.
00:35:30,00:35:31,- And just have natural beauty.
00:35:31,00:35:31,- Exactly.
00:35:31,00:35:34,"- And he was like, ""No, natural beauty."""
00:35:34,00:35:37,"- Yeah, no, have you seen their natural faces underneath?"
00:35:37,00:35:39,And that's also a good read.
00:35:39,00:35:41,"- Lots of slap, dusty bosoms."
00:35:41,00:35:44,(all laughing)
00:35:44,00:35:49,- He gets quoted a lot as a kind of proto pickup artist.
00:35:49,00:35:50,- Yeah.
00:35:50,00:35:53,- And there was a brief trend when that sort of--
00:35:53,00:35:55,"- Neil Strauss, the game."
00:35:55,00:35:57,- Sort of grim thing of pickup artistry was doing a thing.
00:35:57,00:36:00,"A lot of like proto bros were saying,"
00:36:00,00:36:01,"""You can't read Ovid."""
00:36:01,00:36:03,"In much the same way that they were all saying,"
00:36:03,00:36:06,"""You've got to read Sun Tzu's, The Art of War."""
00:36:06,00:36:07,- Are you reading that?
00:36:07,00:36:08,Are you really?
00:36:08,00:36:09,"- Are you actually reading Marx or really,"
00:36:09,00:36:11,"it says meditations, are you?"
00:36:11,00:36:12,- It did actually really remind me of that.
00:36:12,00:36:14,I didn't realise people are connected to those.
00:36:14,00:36:16,It reminded me of that game mentality.
00:36:16,00:36:18,"But a lot of his advice is quite sort of modern,"
00:36:18,00:36:23,like when he says how you should befriend the lady's maid.
00:36:23,00:36:23,- Yes.
00:36:23,00:36:25,- And that's how to get in there.
00:36:25,00:36:26,"- Yes, very clever."
00:36:26,00:36:28,"- So it is a bit like that, yeah."
00:36:28,00:36:28,"I mean, he's--"
00:36:28,00:36:30,- How would he do that with a friend who's a lady's maid?
00:36:30,00:36:32,What kind of life do you need for a gig?
00:36:32,00:36:34,(all laughing)
00:36:34,00:36:34,- So modern.
00:36:34,00:36:35,- That is what you do.
00:36:35,00:36:38,(all laughing)
00:36:38,00:36:39,- But one of the people who's written loads about this
00:36:39,00:36:42,"is a woman called Donna Zuckerberg, who is a classicist."
00:36:42,00:36:45,"And she's written a book called Classics Beyond the Manosphere,"
00:36:45,00:36:46,all about this.
00:36:46,00:36:48,And she is an interesting person.
00:36:48,00:36:49,She's the only Zuckerberg sibling
00:36:49,00:36:52,not to have become a tech titan.
00:36:52,00:36:53,- Wow.
00:36:53,00:36:54,"- Yeah, she's a sister of Mark"
00:36:54,00:36:56,"and there are four, I think four Zuckerbergs."
00:36:56,00:36:57,And yeah.
00:36:57,00:37:00,"- Well, she, yeah, she wrote a book as well"
00:37:00,00:37:01,as the one that you were talking about
00:37:01,00:37:03,called Not All Dead White Men.
00:37:03,00:37:05,And the idea was she was talking about
00:37:05,00:37:07,how the sort of alt-right of America
00:37:07,00:37:11,have really harnessed all the Roman ideas and so on.
00:37:11,00:37:14,And of it is very much connected to the Neil Strauss
00:37:14,00:37:17,the game pickup artist movement that's going on.
00:37:17,00:37:19,And she wants to keep showing the connection
00:37:19,00:37:20,between those two things.
00:37:20,00:37:23,And it's so interesting that she is Mark Zuckerberg's sister
00:37:23,00:37:26,because the very first thing that he did
00:37:26,00:37:27,was a site called FaceMash
00:37:27,00:37:30,"where you got students who went to Harvard University,"
00:37:30,00:37:33,"both women, their pictures, which he hacked off a system"
00:37:33,00:37:35,and you ranked who you thought was hotter.
00:37:35,00:37:38,"That was the original Facebook, basically."
00:37:38,00:37:41,And so she must have been horrified by that
00:37:41,00:37:44,and decided to dedicate her life
00:37:44,00:37:46,to showing what a misogynistic move that was by her brother.
00:37:46,00:37:48,- Sounds like they have parted ways.
00:37:48,00:37:50,"Well, so she's saying Ovid was a misogynist"
00:37:50,00:37:51,and so these guys sort of see--
00:37:51,00:37:53,"- She's not necessarily, she's sort of saying that"
00:37:53,00:37:54,"as Andy was saying before,"
00:37:54,00:37:58,it's that thing of using an old historical idea
00:37:58,00:38:01,to give legitimacy to why you're--
00:38:01,00:38:02,- We can't all blame the fact
00:38:02,00:38:04,that men keep the threatening my maid.
00:38:04,00:38:07,(laughing)
00:38:07,00:38:08,"- Oh, no, Ovid."
00:38:08,00:38:11,"- 'Cause a lot of it does obviously read quite sleazy,"
00:38:11,00:38:12,but a lot of it doesn't.
00:38:12,00:38:13,"You know, he says, send very eloquent love notes."
00:38:13,00:38:15,Cry in front of your loved one.
00:38:15,00:38:17,"I don't recall seeing Andrew Tate saying,"
00:38:17,00:38:19,"""You've gotta be able to cry in front of her."""
00:38:19,00:38:21,"You know, that's not, it is a bit different."
00:38:21,00:38:22,- But what's also different
00:38:22,00:38:24,in which Donna Zuckerberg writes about in her book
00:38:24,00:38:26,"is that it was actually,"
00:38:26,00:38:28,it was quite a lot more dangerous
00:38:28,00:38:29,in the times the advice that he was giving
00:38:29,00:38:31,"because when he was saying things like,"
00:38:31,00:38:34,"befriend the husband of the person you're fancying,"
00:38:34,00:38:35,there was death penalties back in the day
00:38:35,00:38:38,"for things like if you were having a child out of wedlock,"
00:38:38,00:38:39,"if you were, well, it was dangerous."
00:38:39,00:38:41,"It was, there would be certain things"
00:38:41,00:38:43,that you weren't allowed to do that in this day and age.
00:38:43,00:38:46,"You'd get away as sort of just, it's bad manners, but--"
00:38:46,00:38:48,- Is that how you think the affair's gonna go down then?
00:38:48,00:38:49,- Yeah.
00:38:49,00:38:50,(laughing)
00:38:50,00:38:51,- That's Charlie Berger's.
00:38:51,00:38:52,(laughing)
00:38:52,00:38:53,"- No, but yeah, so she points out"
00:38:53,00:38:57,that the risk level was much higher back then
00:38:57,00:38:59,if you were employing these tactics
00:38:59,00:39:01,and they worked on certain women in society.
00:39:01,00:39:02,- Yeah. - Yeah.
00:39:02,00:39:04,- And he suffered the pay the price
00:39:04,00:39:06,'cause he suffered relegatio.
00:39:06,00:39:07,- He did.
00:39:07,00:39:08,- That was the official term for the exile
00:39:08,00:39:09,that he was put through.
00:39:09,00:39:11,- And he died out in--
00:39:11,00:39:11,- Died out there?
00:39:11,00:39:14,Relegatio was the mildest form of exile.
00:39:14,00:39:16,"- What I want to know is when he died,"
00:39:16,00:39:17,was he with somebody?
00:39:17,00:39:19,"Was he, did he find love?"
00:39:19,00:39:21,Did he die in exile alone?
00:39:21,00:39:24,"- His last word was when, and sadly--"
00:39:24,00:39:26,(laughing)
00:39:26,00:39:28,We don't know the answer.
00:39:28,00:39:30,"No, he died very unhappy."
00:39:30,00:39:32,"The last 10 years, he was writing these trusty-eye letters"
00:39:32,00:39:35,"and it was, his book had been banned from libraries"
00:39:35,00:39:37,"and he said, ""Look, it's completely awful out here"
00:39:37,00:39:39,"""in modern day Romania."""
00:39:39,00:39:42,"He said, ""You know, the wine freezes in the jars"
00:39:42,00:39:44,"""and the ice is so thick on the black sea,"
00:39:44,00:39:46,"""the dolphins can't even jump through the water."""
00:39:46,00:39:49,"You know, really horrible, poor guy."
00:39:49,00:39:52,But he was constantly writing poems to his friends
00:39:52,00:39:54,"and to the emperor and to his wife,"
00:39:54,00:39:56,"probably in that order, to defend his cause,"
00:39:56,00:39:58,"say, ""I'm really sorry about all the licentious stuff."
00:39:58,00:40:01,"""I can change, and I will change,"
00:40:01,00:40:04,"""and create pity for himself,"" and it did not work."
00:40:04,00:40:05,"- That's so sad, it reminds me a bit of,"
00:40:05,00:40:09,you know how John Dunn used to write lots of sexy poems?
00:40:09,00:40:11,"And then, in his later life, he did lots of like,"
00:40:11,00:40:16,"""Nuh,"" all his poems were like, ""No, ah, God, God, ah."""
00:40:16,00:40:18,"They were all, that was the kind of vibe."
00:40:18,00:40:19,- Right.
00:40:19,00:40:20,- I didn't know he'd got more like that.
00:40:20,00:40:21,I feel like I've read more of the sexy stuff.
00:40:21,00:40:23,"- Yeah, as only ones are all sexy,"
00:40:23,00:40:26,"and then the later ones are all more self-hating,"
00:40:26,00:40:30,"""God, forgive me,"" and I'm like, ""Sexy past."""
00:40:30,00:40:32,"- God, we all turn into such balls, don't we?"
00:40:32,00:40:33,It's like Tolstoy.
00:40:33,00:40:36,No one ever stays the fun playboy/playgirl.
00:40:36,00:40:38,"Yeah, it's very sad."
00:40:38,00:40:39,- Bit of a good update on Ovid.
00:40:39,00:40:41,I do have a bit of good news about the...
00:40:41,00:40:43,- So right with that sentence.
00:40:43,00:40:44,- Is this breaking news?
00:40:44,00:40:45,Has this just come in?
00:40:45,00:40:50,- It's recent because Ovid's exile was eventually revoked
00:40:51,00:40:56,"in 2017, when Rome's city council,"
00:40:56,00:40:58,"who were not what they once were, I suspect,"
00:40:58,00:41:01,"voted to repair the serious wrong that he had suffered,"
00:41:01,00:41:04,and say his exile was now officially ended.
00:41:04,00:41:07,- Was he like the knight in Indiana Jones 3?
00:41:07,00:41:08,Is he loud?
00:41:08,00:41:10,"- He came back, he came back."
00:41:10,00:41:11,"- Oh, so bad."
00:41:11,00:41:13,"- You decided, why is he here?"
00:41:13,00:41:16,(upbeat music)
00:41:16,00:41:20,"- Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show,"
00:41:20,00:41:22,and that is Andy.
00:41:22,00:41:24,- My fact is that the largest collection
00:41:24,00:41:26,of contemporary South African art in the world
00:41:26,00:41:29,is in Nando's.
00:41:29,00:41:30,- Which branch?
00:41:30,00:41:32,- Every branch.
00:41:32,00:41:32,"No, no, I'm joking."
00:41:32,00:41:35,"The Manchester, Salford Key's one."
00:41:35,00:41:36,- That's a good one.
00:41:36,00:41:37,"- Yeah, and it's big."
00:41:37,00:41:40,So there was a terrific piece in The Guardian recently
00:41:40,00:41:43,about Nando's collection of modern South African art.
00:41:43,00:41:45,Nando's is a chicken restaurant.
00:41:45,00:41:47,"For anyone who doesn't know,"
00:41:47,00:41:48,"I don't know, we have American listeners."
00:41:48,00:41:49,Do you have Nando's?
00:41:49,00:41:50,- I don't think they do have Nando's
00:41:50,00:41:51,in the United States.
00:41:51,00:41:52,"- In America, should we have a Nando's everywhere?"
00:41:52,00:41:53,"- Nando's is global, yeah."
00:41:53,00:41:53,- Yeah.
00:41:53,00:41:57,"- But it's the biggest here, I think it's worth explaining."
00:41:57,00:41:58,I've only been to one.
00:41:58,00:42:00,- Here is the highest ever peri peri penetration
00:42:00,00:42:01,"on the planet, I think, in this country."
00:42:01,00:42:03,You've only ever been to one Nando's.
00:42:03,00:42:05,"- Would you guys, in fact, yeah."
00:42:05,00:42:06,"- Oh, on tour?"
00:42:06,00:42:07,"- On tour, was it?"
00:42:07,00:42:08,Was it the one at Salford?
00:42:08,00:42:09,"- It was the one at Salford, yeah."
00:42:09,00:42:11,And I only went for the art.
00:42:11,00:42:12,(laughing)
00:42:12,00:42:14,"- Would you like anything, madam?"
00:42:14,00:42:17,"Just a tour of your 70s pieces, please, yeah."
00:42:17,00:42:20,"Seriously, you've only been to Nando's once in your life."
00:42:20,00:42:21,"- Yeah, I don't really like dry chicken."
00:42:21,00:42:24,"- Well, it is quite dry chicken."
00:42:24,00:42:25,- It's dry.
00:42:25,00:42:28,"- But he says that there are more than 20 countries, Nando's."
00:42:28,00:42:29,- Uh-huh.
00:42:29,00:42:30,"- I think you've got to be more than that, you know."
00:42:30,00:42:31,- Yeah.
00:42:31,00:42:33,"- Actually, it's not that much, isn't it, really,"
00:42:33,00:42:34,in the grand scheme of countries.
00:42:34,00:42:36,- It depends on the countries.
00:42:36,00:42:39,"- Yeah, if you're only in Tuvalu, Vanuatu."
00:42:39,00:42:40,"- Yeah, then you're doing something wrong"
00:42:40,00:42:42,"in your marketing, I think."
00:42:42,00:42:43,"- Yeah, so I don't know if they're in the USA,"
00:42:43,00:42:46,"but yeah, they've got about 1,200 restaurants,"
00:42:46,00:42:47,"and across those restaurants,"
00:42:47,00:42:50,"they own 32,000 odd pieces of art,"
00:42:50,00:42:53,and they buy another couple of thousand every year.
00:42:53,00:42:55,"And it's the main, seems to be the main thing,"
00:42:55,00:42:59,keeping the South African contemporary art market going.
00:42:59,00:43:00,"- Well, it's really nice."
00:43:00,00:43:01,"- They re-support artists, yeah."
00:43:01,00:43:03,"- They have a thing called the Creative Block Programme,"
00:43:03,00:43:05,where they basically hand out wooden blocks
00:43:05,00:43:06,for it to be drawn on.
00:43:06,00:43:08,"So it's original commissions as well,"
00:43:08,00:43:10,and they have programs where they look after artists.
00:43:10,00:43:12,"It's, I don't know, the rest of the business is like--"
00:43:12,00:43:15,"- Sorry, they like send wooden blocks to South Africans"
00:43:15,00:43:17,"and say, ""Draw something on this and send it back to us."""
00:43:17,00:43:19,"- Well, two artists who are on the scheme,"
00:43:19,00:43:22,"like they run all these schemes for young artists,"
00:43:22,00:43:25,and they run a thing where it's an apprenticeship program
00:43:25,00:43:27,where they take disadvantaged young people
00:43:27,00:43:30,"who don't have skills, and they train them up over three years"
00:43:30,00:43:33,to become mosaicists or ceramicists.
00:43:33,00:43:34,"- Oh, wow!"
00:43:34,00:43:34,"- It's quite cool, yeah."
00:43:34,00:43:36,And then obviously you get skills.
00:43:36,00:43:39,"So yeah, so Nando's doing something quite good."
00:43:39,00:43:41,I don't know many other restaurants that--
00:43:41,00:43:42,- No.
00:43:42,00:43:43,"- Oh, any of the restaurants that do this."
00:43:43,00:43:44,Does Pizza Express have a--
00:43:44,00:43:46,"- Well, we didn't know this about Nando's, you know."
00:43:46,00:43:48,Pizza Express might have the largest collection
00:43:48,00:43:50,"of statues in the world, but we don't know."
00:43:50,00:43:52,"They also do a mentorship scheme,"
00:43:52,00:43:55,"which is basically for furniture, lighting designers."
00:43:55,00:43:56,They have a lot of this stuff.
00:43:56,00:43:58,The only one that I can think of
00:43:58,00:44:01,that does a similar kind of scheme is Whole Foods.
00:44:01,00:44:03,"Globally, in every Whole Foods,"
00:44:03,00:44:06,they hire someone who is the artist in store.
00:44:06,00:44:08,"So when you go into Whole Foods,"
00:44:08,00:44:09,you might see a lot of different art.
00:44:09,00:44:10,"You might see a lot of different,"
00:44:10,00:44:13,like paper mache sculptures around the mushrooms.
00:44:13,00:44:14,They might have a big mushroom.
00:44:14,00:44:16,That's one person who's doing it bespoke
00:44:16,00:44:18,for the Whole Foods as part of the payroll.
00:44:18,00:44:19,- Really? - Yeah.
00:44:19,00:44:21,- And they're always sculptures of the food.
00:44:21,00:44:22,"- No, no, like whatever it is,"
00:44:22,00:44:23,whatever they decide to do
00:44:23,00:44:26,"as the resident artist of Whole Foods,"
00:44:26,00:44:27,"they get to do. - Okay, sorry."
00:44:27,00:44:28,"I thought you meant it was like, you know,"
00:44:28,00:44:30,"in Japan when they show sushi,"
00:44:30,00:44:32,they have sushi models outside restaurants.
00:44:32,00:44:33,It's not like that.
00:44:33,00:44:34,You're like in the carrots
00:44:34,00:44:34,"and you've got caramel. - No, no, no."
00:44:34,00:44:36,"It'll be signs, it will be posters,"
00:44:36,00:44:38,"whatever they want to do, but that's their job."
00:44:38,00:44:39,They're the Whole Foods artist.
00:44:39,00:44:40,- That's really cool.
00:44:40,00:44:42,"- Yeah, I was quite slow on the uptake on that."
00:44:42,00:44:45,"I was thinking, what are they working behind the counter?"
00:44:45,00:44:46,"It's like, well, let's take an artist"
00:44:46,00:44:49,and get them giving out fish.
00:44:49,00:44:50,- Give them a proper career.
00:44:50,00:44:52,- Something that'll earn them some money.
00:44:52,00:44:53,"- I just want, we're buying this salmon, this broccoli,"
00:44:53,00:44:56,"and I'd like a sketch of me, please,"
00:44:56,00:44:57,while you ring it up.
00:44:57,00:44:58,- Domino's Pizza.
00:44:58,00:44:59,- Do they have corporate art?
00:44:59,00:45:02,"- Well, they have a really close link to Frank Lloyd Wright."
00:45:02,00:45:04,"Like probably the most famous architects,"
00:45:04,00:45:06,"20th century American architects, one of them."
00:45:06,00:45:08,"And like, you know, had all these utopian visions"
00:45:08,00:45:10,of what he wanted to do with his architecture.
00:45:10,00:45:12,"And the founder of Domino's Pizza,"
00:45:12,00:45:15,"this chap called Thomas Monaghan,"
00:45:15,00:45:17,"and he bloody loved Frank Lloyd Wright,"
00:45:17,00:45:18,"it was in the '60s when he founded him,"
00:45:18,00:45:21,and he was responsible in the '80s
00:45:21,00:45:23,"for Frank Lloyd Wright's works,"
00:45:23,00:45:25,"like his furnishings and his decorative art,"
00:45:25,00:45:27,"going up in price, single-handedly,"
00:45:27,00:45:28,'cause he just spent millions.
00:45:28,00:45:30,- Did Frank design the little table
00:45:30,00:45:32,that goes inside the pizza box?
00:45:32,00:45:34,- I don't understand.
00:45:34,00:45:37,So what was Frank doing to the pizzas?
00:45:37,00:45:38,"- Ah, so..."
00:45:38,00:45:42,- He was a side job just to fund the architecture.
00:45:42,00:45:44,"- I don't think Frank gave a shit about pizzas,"
00:45:44,00:45:46,but I think he was dead by this point.
00:45:46,00:45:48,(all laughing)
00:45:48,00:45:51,- So this is getting more tenuous by the moment.
00:45:51,00:45:53,"- No, because the whole of Domino's Pizza"
00:45:53,00:45:55,is like based around Frank Lloyd Wright architecture.
00:45:55,00:46:00,"So its center of operations is a place called Domino's Farms,"
00:46:00,00:46:02,"it's World HQ, and the whole building"
00:46:02,00:46:04,is meant to imitate Frank Lloyd Wright's
00:46:04,00:46:06,prairie style buildings.
00:46:06,00:46:08,"Because the founder of Domino's is so obsessed with him,"
00:46:08,00:46:10,"and there's a whole section in it,"
00:46:10,00:46:11,which is a gallery and exhibition
00:46:11,00:46:14,"of Frank Lloyd Wright artworks, which he's bought up."
00:46:14,00:46:16,He's spent more on Frank Lloyd Wright artwork
00:46:16,00:46:18,than anyone else in the world.
00:46:18,00:46:19,"- Rosie, do you collect art?"
00:46:19,00:46:20,Have you got any pieces in your house?
00:46:20,00:46:22,"- No, not yet."
00:46:22,00:46:23,- Okay.
00:46:23,00:46:24,- Anyone else?
00:46:24,00:46:25,- I might from this Frank man.
00:46:25,00:46:27,(all laughing)
00:46:27,00:46:30,"Again, I don't know if he's still available to buy from."
00:46:30,00:46:32,(all laughing)
00:46:32,00:46:33,Are you an Ando's fan?
00:46:33,00:46:37,"So like you, I find the chicken a bit dry."
00:46:38,00:46:40,"Also, is it free range?"
00:46:40,00:46:42,"I don't know if the chicken's free range, is it?"
00:46:42,00:46:43,- It's already good.
00:46:43,00:46:48,"- And like, if I have battery chicken, I get chicken guilt."
00:46:48,00:46:53,"- Okay, but it is an interesting place in general,"
00:46:53,00:46:56,"because, well, it started in 1987, as did I."
00:46:56,00:46:57,- That is interesting.
00:46:57,00:46:58,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:46:58,00:47:00,"So, you know, I feel an affinity with them,"
00:47:00,00:47:02,"but there is this big thing of the Nando's black card,"
00:47:02,00:47:05,"and I know I've got three people who've all got one,"
00:47:05,00:47:09,"which means you have free Nando's anytime, any place."
00:47:09,00:47:10,- Forever and ever.
00:47:10,00:47:12,"- Yeah, my buddy Tom Davis had it."
00:47:12,00:47:13,Do you know Big Tom?
00:47:13,00:47:13,- Yes.
00:47:13,00:47:17,"- Yeah, Tom and I used to go almost every day"
00:47:17,00:47:19,with his black card in Kentish town.
00:47:19,00:47:21,- You've got to use one of the black cards.
00:47:21,00:47:22,- Many times.
00:47:22,00:47:23,- And why was he given one?
00:47:23,00:47:27,'Cause the person I know who had one was a radio host
00:47:27,00:47:30,who was cool at the time.
00:47:30,00:47:31,- It's just for being famous.
00:47:31,00:47:32,I think they're open for that.
00:47:32,00:47:33,- Tom wasn't famous at the time.
00:47:33,00:47:34,- How did he get one then?
00:47:34,00:47:35,"- Tom called up Nando's,"
00:47:35,00:47:37,"and he said, ""I'm interested in the black card."""
00:47:37,00:47:39,"And then he got called up to the chicken council,"
00:47:39,00:47:44,and he had to present his case for why he wanted it.
00:47:44,00:47:45,- Who sits on the chicken council?
00:47:45,00:47:48,"- That's a, we don't know, that's like the library."
00:47:48,00:47:49,We don't know what's going on.
00:47:49,00:47:52,(all laughing)
00:47:52,00:47:55,- Are they in chicken suits?
00:47:55,00:47:57,"- Well, they wanted chicken suits,"
00:47:57,00:48:00,but they only had gorilla suits at the time.
00:48:00,00:48:02,- Do you know anyone who has the dishume dice?
00:48:02,00:48:04,You heard about the dishume dice.
00:48:04,00:48:06,"So Isha Anakbar has the dishume dice,"
00:48:06,00:48:11,"and what it is, is at the end, you throw the dice,"
00:48:11,00:48:14,"and if it lands, if you get two sixes,"
00:48:14,00:48:17,then you get to get the whole meal for free.
00:48:17,00:48:18,- Really?
00:48:18,00:48:19,- No way.
00:48:19,00:48:21,And what do you have to do to get the dishume dice?
00:48:21,00:48:22,- I don't know.
00:48:22,00:48:24,"- Yes, 'cause that feels like a relatively low-risk"
00:48:24,00:48:25,financial investment for them.
00:48:25,00:48:27,"Send a couple of plastic dice out to some influencers,"
00:48:27,00:48:29,and they have a one-in-thirty-six chance
00:48:29,00:48:29,of getting their meal for free.
00:48:29,00:48:34,"- I went, and he rolled, and we'd ordered so much food,"
00:48:34,00:48:36,"and he got it, we got it all for free,"
00:48:36,00:48:37,and they were so...
00:48:37,00:48:38,- He got two sixes.
00:48:38,00:48:39,- I think they were really upset
00:48:39,00:48:42,because they looked like they didn't even know...
00:48:42,00:48:43,- Oh my god.
00:48:43,00:48:44,"I mean, yeah."
00:48:44,00:48:45,- 'Cause you can get them weighted.
00:48:45,00:48:48,"You can get those, but that's what I would do."
00:48:48,00:48:49,I would go off and have them weighted
00:48:49,00:48:51,"so that no matter what, they land on six."
00:48:51,00:48:52,- Maybe you can't do that
00:48:52,00:48:53,'cause their special dishume dice.
00:48:53,00:48:56,- They must be designed to look like this.
00:48:56,00:48:57,But if you pay just a few thousand pounds
00:48:57,00:49:01,"to a dice craster, he'll be able to make you two double six"
00:49:01,00:49:04,"every time, but then that'll go on the spreadsheet"
00:49:04,00:49:05,at Dishume's queue.
00:49:05,00:49:07,"- Well, you know that spot, don't tell your mate."
00:49:07,00:49:09,I know the world-leading dice.
00:49:09,00:49:11,He makes the weighted dices.
00:49:11,00:49:13,"He does them for people like, ""Get out!"""
00:49:13,00:49:15,"- Dan, I thought you were just bullshitting then"
00:49:15,00:49:17,"when you were saying with such authority,"
00:49:17,00:49:19,you know you can get any dice you like weighted.
00:49:19,00:49:21,- I had drinks with him with the world-leading...
00:49:21,00:49:22,- You're giving away background secrets.
00:49:22,00:49:24,Are you supposed to tell us?
00:49:24,00:49:26,"- We can redact that in the, yeah."
00:49:26,00:49:29,- He's very good friends with my friend
00:49:29,00:49:30,who's the Loch Ness Monster Hunter
00:49:30,00:49:31,and we had drinks on Loch Ness
00:49:31,00:49:33,and he told us all about the dice he showed us.
00:49:33,00:49:35,"Anyway, that's an incredible fact about Dishume."
00:49:35,00:49:36,"- Yeah, that's terrific."
00:49:36,00:49:38,- That's an incredible fact of yours about Tom
00:49:38,00:49:41,because Nando's insist that the only rule is
00:49:41,00:49:44,they never give their black card to anyone who asked for it.
00:49:44,00:49:45,They say it's just if you're famous.
00:49:45,00:49:46,- But how wonderful.
00:49:46,00:49:49,"Before this, I didn't even know there was a chicken committee."
00:49:49,00:49:51,(laughing)
00:49:51,00:49:54,"So you think, what are the chicken committee"
00:49:54,00:49:55,doing the rest of the chicken?
00:49:55,00:49:56,(laughing)
00:49:56,00:49:58,"- Yeah, it's wall-to-wall."
00:49:58,00:50:00,"They're pecking, they're walking."
00:50:00,00:50:01,(laughing)
00:50:01,00:50:04,- I was looking at some logo stuff.
00:50:04,00:50:05,Corporate art logos.
00:50:05,00:50:08,Do you guys know/remember?
00:50:08,00:50:09,I don't know if any of you are old enough.
00:50:09,00:50:11,"Rosie, don't know how old you are, you could be 60."
00:50:11,00:50:12,- I am 60.
00:50:12,00:50:15,"- And if so, you might remember the time"
00:50:15,00:50:18,when the Starbucks logo was naked.
00:50:18,00:50:19,- Oh.
00:50:19,00:50:20,"- So you know she has hair over her breast now,"
00:50:20,00:50:21,she used to have tits out.
00:50:21,00:50:22,"- Oh, naked."
00:50:22,00:50:23,"- Stop it, did she?"
00:50:23,00:50:25,Are you gonna have to Google this right now?
00:50:25,00:50:26,"- Yeah, 'cause she's a mermaid, right?"
00:50:26,00:50:27,- Is she?
00:50:27,00:50:28,"- Yeah, yeah, she's a mermaid."
00:50:28,00:50:29,"Although she has two tails,"
00:50:29,00:50:31,so it's quite an unconventional mermaid.
00:50:31,00:50:33,"- Oh, look, there she is."
00:50:33,00:50:34,- She's actually quite unattractive and frumpy.
00:50:34,00:50:36,- She's very unattractive.
00:50:36,00:50:37,I don't wanna judge her.
00:50:37,00:50:38,- I'll judge her.
00:50:38,00:50:40,"- This is a 15th century drawing of a siren though,"
00:50:40,00:50:41,and that was the Starbucks logo.
00:50:41,00:50:45,- She looks like you're drunk uncle at a wedding.
00:50:45,00:50:46,- Wow.
00:50:46,00:50:46,- Yeah.
00:50:46,00:50:47,"She does look drunk,"
00:50:47,00:50:48,"'cause she looks like she's saying,"
00:50:48,00:50:50,"""I've caught these two fish,"""
00:50:50,00:50:52,and doesn't realize she's holding her own lower body.
00:50:52,00:50:54,"- Oh, that's classic, yeah, yeah."
00:50:54,00:50:56,"- Wow, so for two women who are very positive"
00:50:56,00:50:59,"about Mrs. Gaskell, it's not universal sisterhood."
00:50:59,00:51:00,"- No, no."
00:51:00,00:51:01,- This is not what a feminist looks like.
00:51:01,00:51:03,"- I don't know, they're both in agreement though."
00:51:03,00:51:04,At least it's consistency.
00:51:04,00:51:06,- You just gotta go with us.
00:51:06,00:51:08,- That's what true femininity looks like.
00:51:08,00:51:12,"- So that was the Starbucks logo,"
00:51:12,00:51:13,a weird 15th century--
00:51:13,00:51:15,- Why did they change it?
00:51:15,00:51:16,That's not it.
00:51:16,00:51:17,"- Well, it's just an upgrade, isn't it?"
00:51:17,00:51:19,"Yeah, it's a Nordic woodcut."
00:51:19,00:51:22,"She is, yeah, boobs out and bits of tail in each hand."
00:51:22,00:51:24,"She looks more like she's holding fish now,"
00:51:24,00:51:25,'cause you can't see the bottom of her tail.
00:51:25,00:51:26,"So if you look at the Starbucks logo,"
00:51:26,00:51:28,it looks like she's just holding two dead fish.
00:51:28,00:51:29,- Right.
00:51:29,00:51:30,- I don't think they sell anything with fish.
00:51:30,00:51:32,- They don't sell anything fish-related.
00:51:32,00:51:34,"- No, they do, they do the tuna macchiato."
00:51:34,00:51:35,That is lovely.
00:51:35,00:51:36,(laughing)
00:51:36,00:51:38,That's really nice.
00:51:38,00:51:40,So it was a controversial
00:51:40,00:51:42,"because she agreed to the one woodcut,"
00:51:42,00:51:45,but then they put her on all of the cups and all of the--
00:51:45,00:51:46,- Yes.
00:51:46,00:51:47,"- Yeah, right."
00:51:47,00:51:49,"- Just to tie together this with the howling,"
00:51:49,00:51:52,I didn't spot any artworks on display in howling too.
00:51:52,00:51:53,- Right.
00:51:53,00:51:57,- But it's really hard to use original art in films.
00:51:57,00:51:59,"There are, like the world of image rights"
00:51:59,00:52:00,has tightened up a lot lately.
00:52:00,00:52:02,"You can't just, if you want to show the Mona Lisa"
00:52:02,00:52:03,"or Girl with a Palm Earring or whatever,"
00:52:03,00:52:05,you can't just stick a print in a frame
00:52:05,00:52:07,and pretend in the film.
00:52:07,00:52:09,'Cause artistic estates get a bit funny about that
00:52:09,00:52:11,and rightful owners and all of this.
00:52:11,00:52:14,So lots of times when they make a film
00:52:14,00:52:16,"which features art, or they want it to include"
00:52:16,00:52:18,"really famous art, they take weeks and weeks"
00:52:18,00:52:21,making replicas and then the estate of the artist
00:52:21,00:52:24,"insists that the artwork is destroyed,"
00:52:24,00:52:27,that the filmmakers record and film
00:52:27,00:52:29,the destruction of the artwork
00:52:29,00:52:30,and then send them the evidence
00:52:30,00:52:32,of the fake artwork being destroyed.
00:52:32,00:52:34,- That's so interesting 'cause you would figure--
00:52:34,00:52:34,- That's insane.
00:52:34,00:52:36,- You'd figure that would go on a memorabilia market
00:52:36,00:52:39,as opposed to being passed off as a--
00:52:39,00:52:40,- I don't know what they're worried about.
00:52:40,00:52:41,"It might be passing off, yeah."
00:52:41,00:52:44,There was a film about Basquiat in 1996
00:52:44,00:52:46,and the estate asked for so much money
00:52:46,00:52:47,"to use Basquiat images that they said,"
00:52:47,00:52:49,"well, we can't make the film."
00:52:49,00:52:51,"So instead, they just knocked up a load"
00:52:51,00:52:55,of Basquiat style artwork.
00:52:55,00:52:57,But then they had to have a lawyer look at all of the artworks
00:52:57,00:52:59,"and say, that's fine, that's fine,"
00:52:59,00:53:02,"that's too close to actual Basquiat, can't use that."
00:53:02,00:53:02,"- Wow, wow."
00:53:02,00:53:04,"- So all of that is sort of artist approved, yeah."
00:53:04,00:53:06,- Is any film producer ever experimented
00:53:06,00:53:07,when they get that initial rejection
00:53:07,00:53:09,"with saying, okay, well instead,"
00:53:09,00:53:12,we'll draw a load of badly sketched cock and balls
00:53:12,00:53:13,to claim that's Basquiat
00:53:13,00:53:15,and see what the estate has to say about that?
00:53:15,00:53:16,- I don't know.
00:53:16,00:53:18,- I think the house is strong position.
00:53:18,00:53:19,- You'd be a great film producer.
00:53:19,00:53:20,You'd be like really ballsy.
00:53:20,00:53:22,- That doesn't work for the movie.
00:53:22,00:53:23,(all laughing)
00:53:23,00:53:25,"- If it's a da Vinci code, it's a bluff."
00:53:25,00:53:28,"- Yeah, in the da Vinci code,"
00:53:28,00:53:30,if the Mona Lisa looked like--
00:53:30,00:53:31,- It's like a cock and balls.
00:53:31,00:53:32,(all laughing)
00:53:32,00:53:34,You've got to hope that they bring first.
00:53:34,00:53:35,(all laughing)
00:53:35,00:53:37,"Otherwise, you're stuck with the wind film."
00:53:37,00:53:38,- Who's gonna look more stupid?
00:53:38,00:53:40,"I don't know, I don't know."
00:53:40,00:53:42,(all laughing)
00:53:42,00:53:45,(upbeat music)
00:53:47,00:53:48,"- Okay, that's it."
