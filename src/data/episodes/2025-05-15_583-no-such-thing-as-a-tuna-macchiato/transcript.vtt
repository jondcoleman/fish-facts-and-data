00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.400
 - Hi, everybody.

00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:03.320
 Before we start the show, I just wanted to let you know

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:06.000
 I'm joined by a very exciting guest right now.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.640
 It is a world acclaimed author, Andrew Hunter Murray.

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:10.480
 Hello, Andrew.

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:11.320
 - Hello.

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:12.560
 - You've written a book right here.

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:13.880
 - Yes, I've written a book.

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:15.640
 It's called "A Beginner's Guide to Breaking and Entering."

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:17.840
 It's out in paperback now.

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:19.260
 - Yes, I've actually read it.

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:20.760
 And not even just 'cause I'm friends with him

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.440
 because it's such a fun read.

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:27.400
 And it's actually not a guide to how to break into a house

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:29.600
 and burgle it, which is obviously what I was hoping for.

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:31.440
 - It's even better than that.

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:32.680
 Tell us about it.

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:35.120
 - Well, it's about a young guy called Al

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:38.080
 who lives in lovely, empty second homes

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:40.040
 when the real life owners are away.

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:42.120
 He doesn't break things, he doesn't steal things.

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:43.440
 He just makes his way in,

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.880
 lives in these gorgeous places, and then gets out again.

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:48.720
 And this book is the story of when he and his friends

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:51.080
 break into the wrong home on the wrong day,

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:53.480
 someone ends up dead, not his fault,

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:55.640
 and things just get more complicated from there.

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:56.600
 It's a caper.

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:58.760
 - It is a plus, a little bit of satire

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:00.840
 in the housing market, which every good book needs.

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.600
 And obviously he joins up with a fun motley crew

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:04.920
 of fellow breakers and enterers.

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.440
 It really is such a fun book to read.

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:10.840
 And I believe it's available in bookshops, is that right?

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:12.160
 - It's available in all bookshops.

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:14.440
 And even better, if you're an audio person,

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:17.160
 it's in a two for one deal on Audible.

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:18.680
 That and one of my other books the last day

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:20.920
 are both included in the current Audible deal,

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:22.920
 which is lasting a few more days

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.120
 where you can get two books for one credit.

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:28.660
 - Do it, go, listen to the book and then read the book.

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:30.720
 - Do both, it really is worth it.

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.280
 And speaking of guests, we had a fantastic guest on today.

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:35.640
 We had so much fun with her in the episode

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:36.560
 that you're about to hear.

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.400
 It was the excellent comedian Rosie Holt,

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:42.200
 who I'm sure many of you are familiar with.

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.640
 And once you've listened to this, if you're in the market

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.760
 for some very sharp skewering of what's going on

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:50.480
 in politics today, you have to check out her podcast,

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:52.880
 which is called Non-Censored.

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:54.320
 On the other hand, if what you fancy

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:57.560
 is a very witty satire on the last government,

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.720
 then check out her book, which is called Why We Were Right.

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:03.340
 So that is Non-Censored, the podcast,

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:05.700
 or Why We Were Right, the book.

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.940
 But for now, enjoy the show.

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:09.300
 - On with the podcast.

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.720
 (jazz music)

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:15.140
 (jazz music)

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:27.060
 - Hello and welcome to another episode

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.760
 of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.520
 coming to you from the QI offices in Hoburn.

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:33.560
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.760
 I am sitting here with Anna Tyshinski,

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.040
 Andrew Hunter Murray, and Rosie Holt.

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.080
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.440
 with our favorite facts from the last seven days.

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:45.320
 And in no particular order, here we go.

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:48.880
 Starting with fact number one, and that is Rosie.

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:51.960
 - My fact this week is all the werewolves

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:54.940
 in the film Howling 2 are actually monkeys

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:57.440
 because the wrong costumes were delivered.

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:59.560
 (laughing)

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:01.360
 - So, so much to unpack here.

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:03.920
 You said Howling 2, like every listener's gonna know.

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:07.240
 - Everyone knows about the famous film Howling 2.

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:10.560
 I think somewhere Howling 2 was called

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:12.320
 the worst sequel of all time.

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:14.040
 (laughing)

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:16.120
 - Those people clearly never saw Howling 8.

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:18.720
 (laughing)

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:21.400
 - And you're a fan, right Rosie?

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:24.400
 - Sort of, I'm fascinated by it.

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:27.300
 So, I don't wanna spoil too much for people

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:30.420
 who are really excited about watching Howling 2,

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:32.440
 but it leaves off where Howling 1

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:35.500
 (laughing)

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:38.700
 finishes, where spoiler alert,

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:42.260
 the female lead turns into a werewolf and she is killed.

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:45.260
 And at the beginning of Howling 2, it's her funeral.

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:49.180
 And the best line ever is where Christopher Liu

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:50.780
 pops up, 'cause why not?

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:54.980
 And he says, he says, I'm afraid your sister was a werewolf.

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:56.460
 And the guy goes, God damn it,

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:58.680
 that's my sister you're talking about.

00:03:58.680 --> 00:03:59.520
 (laughing)

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:00.360
 - And he says it at the funeral.

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:01.200
 - Yes.

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:02.020
 - And he turns over to the funeral,

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:02.860
 no one knows who he is.

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:03.700
 He's just a weird guy.

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:04.540
 - Just a weird old guy.

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:05.700
 - He stands at the back and then says that.

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:07.380
 And you can understand, we haven't led up to,

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:09.100
 like, did you know there are more things on earth

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:11.900
 than a dreamt of, you know, like the werewolves exist.

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:14.220
 As far as I can tell, this is fresh news for this guy.

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:15.060
 - No, it's a cold open.

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:17.540
 - I must say, 'cause I think I might be the person on the planet

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:19.820
 who's watched Howling 2 most recently.

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:22.220
 - I finished one hour ago and then I came straight

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:23.060
 directly here.

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:24.660
 (laughing)

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:26.260
 And it's really good.

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:27.940
 - Watching it with the knowledge of what happened

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:29.420
 with these costumes, it was a mix-up.

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:31.460
 They were Planet of the Apes TV series.

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:33.020
 - Oh yeah, that's the costume story.

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:35.900
 - Yeah, so basically, they were sent the costumes.

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:36.740
 The costumes were late.

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:38.780
 When they opened the costumes,

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:41.980
 it was actually from the Planet of the Apes TV show.

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:44.900
 And then, good old Christopher Lee saved the day

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:48.100
 because he said, this is what we're going to do, Philippe,

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:49.380
 that's the director.

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:51.900
 We're going to shoot a scene where we simply explain

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:54.460
 that werewolves go through three phases,

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:58.180
 a human phase, a monkey phase, and then a werewolf phase.

00:04:58.180 --> 00:04:59.420
 And that will solve everything.

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:00.260
 - No.

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:01.420
 - And it did. - And it did.

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:02.260
 - Yes. - Yeah.

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:03.300
 - And that's what they do. - Yeah.

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:04.140
 - Pretty much.

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:05.220
 - So do they look like monkeys?

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:06.060
 - They look exactly like monkeys.

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:08.220
 - They look exactly like monkeys from Planet of the Apes.

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:09.060
 (laughing)

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:10.180
 - It's really confusing.

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:12.500
 And they shot it all in the dark.

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:14.700
 And then later on, once they got a werewolf head,

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:17.220
 they spliced in lots of shots of a random werewolf head

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:18.060
 crossing a screen.

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:19.060
 It's terrific.

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:20.020
 It's so good.

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:21.740
 I mean, there's so much in this film.

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:22.580
 - Yes.

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:23.740
 And there's lots of great little facts.

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:24.980
 So the other thing about the costumes

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:28.380
 was there's a threesome scene where they're all werewolves

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:30.420
 and they're all having sexy fun.

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:32.220
 But if you probably remember, Andrew.

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:33.340
 - I remember the scene very well.

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:34.180
 - Yes.

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:37.540
 It's not a terribly, I mean, vigorous threesome.

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:40.540
 They're sort of tentatively stroking each other

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:42.620
 and growling, and it's because,

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:46.340
 so they'd had to be covered in hair for the costumes.

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:48.060
 And this took, I think this took like eight hours.

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:51.780
 And then they found out that when you touched each other,

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:53.060
 the hair came off.

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:53.900
 - Yeah.

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:55.620
 - So therefore they were having to not touch each other

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:58.460
 because they realized if they actually did an orgy,

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:01.660
 well, a film orgy, all their costumes would fall off.

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:03.340
 - 'Cause it wasn't a costume.

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:06.860
 It was them naked for eight hours with them putting

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:08.180
 little bits of hair on them.

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:09.020
 - Oh, was it them naked?

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:09.860
 Like, yeah.

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:10.780
 - Sorry, I didn't explain that very well.

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:12.140
 It would have made more sense to put them

00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:13.220
 in the monkey costumes for this.

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:15.260
 But I guess they thought because they're sort of naked,

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:16.340
 it's still going to be sexy-ish.

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:17.940
 - It's not quite as sexy as the monkey costume.

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:18.780
 - Yeah.

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:19.980
 - It's the hairiest and most chased three

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:20.820
 some ever committed.

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:22.540
 - It's a rare double award.

00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:25.180
 Rosie, is this one of your favorite films or something?

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:26.380
 - It's not one of my favorite films,

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:29.020
 but I do have a real soft spot for it.

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:30.220
 - 'Cause it's genuinely so bad it's good.

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:31.260
 - It is so bad it's good.

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:32.380
 - After the first 10 minutes, I thought,

00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:33.940
 I hope, I can't believe we're going to cover this

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:34.980
 in case someone watches it.

00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:36.660
 And now, I say watch it.

00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:37.500
 - Yeah.

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:38.340
 Do you totally?

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:39.860
 - I mean, it has, the weird thing about Christopher Lee

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:42.780
 is that he's a good actor who's only done shit films

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:44.420
 with a few exceptions, obviously.

00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:46.220
 - Lord of the Rings, Man with the Golden Gun,

00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:47.820
 The Wicker Man, one of the greatest horror films

00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:49.540
 I've ever made.

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:50.660
 - So he's done some good films,

00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:53.140
 but he's done a lot of really bad films.

00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:54.540
 - I think the only reason he did this movie

00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:56.900
 was 'cause he realized he hadn't done a werewolf movie.

00:06:56.900 --> 00:06:57.740
 So he thought, okay.

00:06:57.740 --> 00:06:58.580
 - And thought, this is the one.

00:06:58.580 --> 00:06:59.980
 - This is the one, howling two.

00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:01.180
 - This is the one.

00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:03.500
 - The filming of this one sounds amazing.

00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:05.180
 'Cause Christopher Lee, we must have mentioned before,

00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:06.700
 is like an amazing character.

00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:10.540
 He had this great war past where he worked for the SOE,

00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:12.380
 the special operations executive in the war,

00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:15.620
 which was like the secret service under Churchill.

00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:17.300
 No one really knows what he did there

00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:19.100
 'cause he was never allowed to talk about it.

00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:22.340
 But it seems like the one person he confided in

00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:23.980
 was the director of this film,

00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:25.380
 who was called Philippe Mora.

00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:27.700
 - Yeah, 'cause he was a Nazi hunter.

00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:28.700
 - Yes.

00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:31.460
 - But apparently they landed in Czechoslovakia,

00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:34.820
 which it was at the time, where it was being filmed.

00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:36.860
 And they got to the airport

00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:39.260
 and there was this huge crowd of people

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:40.860
 who were all like cheering and waving

00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:42.540
 and giving this heroes welcome.

00:07:42.540 --> 00:07:43.380
 - Wait, hang on.

00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:44.220
 - Yeah, go on.

00:07:44.220 --> 00:07:45.060
 - Quick query.

00:07:45.060 --> 00:07:45.900
 - Go.

00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:48.940
 - He was a super secret war hero and Nazi hunter.

00:07:48.940 --> 00:07:51.460
 And yet he's so globally famous as a Nazi hunter

00:07:51.460 --> 00:07:53.220
 that everyone in the Czech Republic

00:07:53.220 --> 00:07:54.780
 knows who he is at the airport.

00:07:54.780 --> 00:07:56.020
 - He must have been like James Bond,

00:07:56.020 --> 00:07:57.500
 where he just didn't hide.

00:07:57.500 --> 00:08:00.620
 - Is that totally plausible?

00:08:00.620 --> 00:08:03.820
 - No, no, there were elements of his war past

00:08:03.820 --> 00:08:04.900
 that were known at that point.

00:08:04.900 --> 00:08:06.340
 'Cause it was the 80s by then.

00:08:06.340 --> 00:08:09.820
 And basically it seemed to be widely accepted

00:08:09.820 --> 00:08:12.020
 that as part of his spying war history,

00:08:12.020 --> 00:08:15.380
 he'd been involved in the assassination of Reinhard Heidrich,

00:08:15.380 --> 00:08:18.820
 who was the highest ranking Nazi ever,

00:08:18.820 --> 00:08:20.980
 assassinated by the West.

00:08:20.980 --> 00:08:23.780
 So he landed in Prague and he got this heroes welcome.

00:08:23.780 --> 00:08:25.540
 And the director was like, one, do that's for one.

00:08:25.540 --> 00:08:27.780
 Christopher Lee was like, I'm gonna stop you there.

00:08:27.780 --> 00:08:28.860
 It'll be for me.

00:08:28.860 --> 00:08:31.740
 - For my Nazi killing.

00:08:31.740 --> 00:08:34.460
 - I have seen a couple of stories saying

00:08:34.460 --> 00:08:36.540
 did he exaggerate his war record at all?

00:08:36.540 --> 00:08:38.380
 And I haven't had the time to properly look into them.

00:08:38.380 --> 00:08:39.380
 And I just hope he didn't.

00:08:39.380 --> 00:08:40.540
 - I didn't want to be scared to do that.

00:08:40.540 --> 00:08:42.260
 - If he got such a heroes welcome,

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:44.820
 surely he didn't exaggerate any of it.

00:08:44.820 --> 00:08:45.660
 - Yeah, but it could have been--

00:08:45.660 --> 00:08:48.100
 - He was also a globally favoured film star at the time.

00:08:48.100 --> 00:08:49.820
 They might be showing any old stuff.

00:08:49.820 --> 00:08:51.420
 - I don't think that's relevant.

00:08:51.420 --> 00:08:52.740
 I don't think that's what to do with it.

00:08:52.740 --> 00:08:53.820
 - The checks are above that.

00:08:53.820 --> 00:08:56.740
 - But because it was filmed in Czechsvakia,

00:08:56.740 --> 00:08:59.380
 Christopher Lee and Sibyl Daning, was it Sibyl Danning?

00:08:59.380 --> 00:09:00.220
 - Yeah.

00:09:00.220 --> 00:09:02.380
 - Yeah, they both were getting followed the whole time

00:09:02.380 --> 00:09:05.180
 while they were shooting by two creepy men

00:09:05.180 --> 00:09:06.220
 who would sit in the corner

00:09:06.220 --> 00:09:07.980
 when they ate in the restaurant in the evening.

00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:09.900
 - As in like Iron Curtain's bunnies or secret police?

00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:11.780
 - Yes, Iron Curtain's smiles.

00:09:11.780 --> 00:09:13.620
 - Oh, Iron Curtain's smiles.

00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:14.460
 'Cause they did, yeah, they did.

00:09:14.460 --> 00:09:16.420
 They were making phone calls back home

00:09:16.420 --> 00:09:18.740
 and they could hear them in the background,

00:09:18.740 --> 00:09:20.140
 just like men breathing and coughing

00:09:20.140 --> 00:09:22.180
 as they were listening in on the conversations.

00:09:22.180 --> 00:09:23.020
 - It's worth it, guys.

00:09:23.020 --> 00:09:24.260
 Were they that the Soviet Union had?

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:25.180
 No wonder it fell apart.

00:09:25.180 --> 00:09:27.020
 If it didn't have its shit together to stay quiet

00:09:27.020 --> 00:09:28.380
 on a phone call, it was just listening.

00:09:28.380 --> 00:09:29.980
 - I think they're using the Christopher Lee,

00:09:29.980 --> 00:09:33.140
 tell you I'm a Nazi murderer process.

00:09:33.140 --> 00:09:33.980
 They don't care.

00:09:33.980 --> 00:09:37.860
 - The lead actress is Sibyl Danning, as you just said.

00:09:37.860 --> 00:09:38.700
 There is a bit of the film,

00:09:38.700 --> 00:09:41.140
 a slightly sexy bit where she rips her shirt off.

00:09:41.140 --> 00:09:44.220
 It's a very charged scene, you know?

00:09:44.220 --> 00:09:46.140
 But she apparently had been asked to do this

00:09:46.140 --> 00:09:48.540
 in lots of films because she was very attractive

00:09:48.540 --> 00:09:49.460
 and she was a bit bored of it.

00:09:49.460 --> 00:09:50.300
 And she said, "Do you know what?

00:09:50.300 --> 00:09:53.420
 I think I'd like to do just one topless scene

00:09:53.420 --> 00:09:55.660
 or even one topless shot entirely in this film.

00:09:55.660 --> 00:09:56.500
 Is that okay?"

00:09:56.500 --> 00:09:58.500
 And the actress said, "Yeah, great, great, great."

00:09:58.500 --> 00:09:59.340
 Anyway, she turns out--

00:09:59.340 --> 00:10:00.500
 - So she said, "I want to be limited to one."

00:10:00.500 --> 00:10:03.260
 - Yes, she just wants to do this once, which happened.

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:04.620
 She then turns up to the premiere of the film

00:10:04.620 --> 00:10:06.700
 where the credits, the closing sequence of the credits

00:10:06.700 --> 00:10:09.460
 uses that shot a further 17 times

00:10:09.460 --> 00:10:11.500
 for absolutely no reason.

00:10:11.500 --> 00:10:14.380
 - Yeah, it just has, on repeat, like exposing her chest.

00:10:14.380 --> 00:10:15.700
 - No.

00:10:15.700 --> 00:10:16.820
 - Wow.

00:10:16.820 --> 00:10:18.700
 - Like a sort of sexy gift.

00:10:18.700 --> 00:10:22.100
 - If you give them an inch, they will take a month off.

00:10:22.100 --> 00:10:24.900
 - But it's so Mora, the director, back to him for a second,

00:10:24.900 --> 00:10:26.740
 he didn't know they were going to do that

00:10:26.740 --> 00:10:28.700
 to Danning, the actress.

00:10:28.700 --> 00:10:29.540
 So he actually--

00:10:29.540 --> 00:10:30.780
 - Because they were friends, weren't they?

00:10:30.780 --> 00:10:31.620
 - They were friends.

00:10:31.620 --> 00:10:34.020
 And he kind of, at the end of the movie,

00:10:34.020 --> 00:10:36.620
 they brought in some other people to do a final edit on it.

00:10:36.620 --> 00:10:39.060
 And part of that edit was throwing in 17 shots

00:10:39.060 --> 00:10:41.140
 of her topless during the credit sequence.

00:10:41.140 --> 00:10:42.580
 And he was really pissed off by that.

00:10:42.580 --> 00:10:44.100
 So he then goes on, he says,

00:10:44.100 --> 00:10:47.060
 "I want to make Howling 3 because I want to fix

00:10:47.060 --> 00:10:49.340
 "the reputation of what this did."

00:10:49.340 --> 00:10:50.660
 - Because of that credit sequence.

00:10:50.660 --> 00:10:51.500
 - Well, he was just pissed off.

00:10:51.500 --> 00:10:53.300
 - The whole film, I think.

00:10:53.300 --> 00:10:55.580
 A lot of rehab work on your career.

00:10:55.580 --> 00:10:57.540
 I don't think the credit sequence is the main problem.

00:10:57.540 --> 00:10:59.540
 It's problematic, but it's, woof.

00:10:59.540 --> 00:11:03.060
 - Yeah, so Howling 3 sounds amazing.

00:11:03.060 --> 00:11:05.420
 Howling 3, the marsupials.

00:11:05.420 --> 00:11:09.620
 This then is set in Australia, has no reoccurring characters,

00:11:09.620 --> 00:11:12.460
 has no plot that is connected to anything else.

00:11:12.460 --> 00:11:15.900
 In it, the humans that are transformed into the Howling

00:11:15.900 --> 00:11:17.700
 have pouches like marsupials.

00:11:17.700 --> 00:11:18.820
 - Amazing.

00:11:18.820 --> 00:11:20.460
 - Yeah, it sounds pretty amazing.

00:11:20.460 --> 00:11:22.900
 He generally just in praise of Mora,

00:11:22.900 --> 00:11:24.300
 'cause he's an Aussie film director,

00:11:24.300 --> 00:11:25.460
 and I'd never heard of him.

00:11:25.460 --> 00:11:28.380
 But his list of movies is extraordinary.

00:11:28.380 --> 00:11:30.580
 I'm really obsessed with a movie that he directed

00:11:30.580 --> 00:11:33.740
 called "Teridactile Women" from Beverly Hills.

00:11:33.740 --> 00:11:34.980
 - Wow. - I know, right?

00:11:34.980 --> 00:11:36.620
 So listen to the plot.

00:11:36.620 --> 00:11:39.660
 Paleontologist Dick Chandler discovers a dinosaur egg

00:11:39.660 --> 00:11:42.860
 prompting an eccentric witch doctor named Salvador Dali

00:11:42.860 --> 00:11:44.780
 to put a curse on Chandler's wife, Pixie,

00:11:44.780 --> 00:11:48.020
 causing her to slowly transform into a pterodactyl.

00:11:48.020 --> 00:11:49.660
 After Pixie lays an egg,

00:11:49.660 --> 00:11:52.060
 Dick tracks down Salvador Dali and apologizes,

00:11:52.060 --> 00:11:53.300
 and the curse is lifted.

00:11:53.300 --> 00:11:54.500
 (laughing)

00:11:54.500 --> 00:11:56.980
 Now, Barry Humphries is in this movie.

00:11:56.980 --> 00:11:58.900
 It's like a proper movie.

00:11:58.900 --> 00:12:00.580
 I can't wait to see that.

00:12:00.580 --> 00:12:01.420
 - Barry Humphries.

00:12:01.420 --> 00:12:03.220
 - Barry Humphries is in it.

00:12:03.220 --> 00:12:06.740
 There's a bit where Christopher Lee says in "Howling 2,"

00:12:06.740 --> 00:12:08.980
 right, there are some sort of King werewolves

00:12:08.980 --> 00:12:11.780
 and Queen werewolves, they cannot be killed with silver.

00:12:11.780 --> 00:12:13.900
 This is like, there's an oh no moment, oh no,

00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:14.740
 what are we gonna do?

00:12:14.740 --> 00:12:17.460
 They just says they can be killed with titanium,

00:12:17.460 --> 00:12:19.980
 which, although a slightly harder method to get hold of,

00:12:19.980 --> 00:12:21.940
 was very much easily available at the time.

00:12:21.940 --> 00:12:23.780
 (laughing)

00:12:23.780 --> 00:12:24.820
 It's stunning.

00:12:24.820 --> 00:12:27.900
 - Is that a copyright thing with Bran Stoker's people?

00:12:27.900 --> 00:12:29.300
 - I have no idea.

00:12:29.300 --> 00:12:31.060
 - I read an interview with the director,

00:12:31.060 --> 00:12:35.180
 and he was really so, 'cause it got so panned,

00:12:35.180 --> 00:12:37.780
 and he's so enthusiastic about it,

00:12:37.780 --> 00:12:39.140
 and everything he got asked, he'd go,

00:12:39.140 --> 00:12:41.260
 "Thank you for asking that."

00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:43.020
 And one of the things he said, which I liked,

00:12:43.020 --> 00:12:45.220
 was in the poster, there's Sibyl Danning,

00:12:45.220 --> 00:12:47.500
 she's wearing these sunglasses,

00:12:47.500 --> 00:12:49.220
 which will obviously appear in the movie,

00:12:49.220 --> 00:12:51.860
 and that came about 'cause he said that she came along

00:12:51.860 --> 00:12:53.580
 and she had conjunctivitis, and they were like,

00:12:53.580 --> 00:12:55.020
 "What, what were we doing?"

00:12:55.020 --> 00:12:57.380
 He was like, "Don't worry, you're a werewolf,

00:12:57.380 --> 00:13:00.220
 and a werewolf can wear sunglasses indoors

00:13:00.220 --> 00:13:01.420
 if they want to."

00:13:01.420 --> 00:13:02.260
 (laughing)

00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:06.020
 - And that's what your identity is like the concealed now.

00:13:06.020 --> 00:13:08.140
 - I read that somewhere that that became

00:13:08.140 --> 00:13:10.420
 very influential in the movie industry.

00:13:10.420 --> 00:13:12.060
 So if you think of the Lost Boys,

00:13:12.060 --> 00:13:13.420
 the vampire movies and so on,

00:13:13.420 --> 00:13:14.380
 they're all wearing glasses,

00:13:14.380 --> 00:13:16.300
 and according to numerous people,

00:13:16.300 --> 00:13:17.700
 that was a direct influence.

00:13:17.700 --> 00:13:19.180
 It suddenly was cool to do it.

00:13:19.180 --> 00:13:21.980
 - It's hard to imagine this film had any influence.

00:13:21.980 --> 00:13:23.100
 (laughing)

00:13:23.100 --> 00:13:24.860
 - I think it might have been the '80s.

00:13:24.860 --> 00:13:27.300
 Christopher Lee's in it, it was a proper release.

00:13:27.300 --> 00:13:29.020
 It's part of a massive franchise.

00:13:29.020 --> 00:13:29.860
 - Yeah.

00:13:29.860 --> 00:13:32.460
 - I was just looking at monkey costumes.

00:13:32.460 --> 00:13:33.300
 - Oh yeah.

00:13:33.300 --> 00:13:36.420
 - And the gorilla movies used to be a really big thing

00:13:36.420 --> 00:13:37.980
 in the '20s and '30s.

00:13:37.980 --> 00:13:40.460
 They were a cultural preoccupation.

00:13:40.460 --> 00:13:41.300
 I suppose they are now.

00:13:41.300 --> 00:13:42.260
 - Why? - Actually, Kong.

00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:43.100
 - Anything else?

00:13:43.100 --> 00:13:44.340
 - It's all leading up to King Kong.

00:13:44.340 --> 00:13:45.980
 Basically, they started with normal-sized gorillas,

00:13:45.980 --> 00:13:49.100
 and then they worked their way up to Kong.

00:13:49.100 --> 00:13:50.380
 But we still have loads of Kong stuff now,

00:13:50.380 --> 00:13:51.580
 and we're still having plenty of the games.

00:13:51.580 --> 00:13:54.700
 So this is a permanent societal thing.

00:13:54.700 --> 00:13:56.900
 But there was one guy called Charles Gamora,

00:13:56.900 --> 00:13:59.220
 who was known as the King of the Gorilla Men

00:13:59.220 --> 00:14:00.740
 in the '20s and '30s,

00:14:00.740 --> 00:14:02.620
 partly because he had his own suit.

00:14:02.620 --> 00:14:03.860
 (laughing)

00:14:03.860 --> 00:14:06.700
 So any film that needed a gorilla,

00:14:06.700 --> 00:14:08.740
 get Charles Gamora on set now.

00:14:08.740 --> 00:14:11.020
 And he'd done a bit of, he'd seen,

00:14:11.020 --> 00:14:13.020
 he was very convincing in his suit.

00:14:13.020 --> 00:14:14.740
 And he was the right sort of height,

00:14:14.740 --> 00:14:16.900
 and he looked into the San Diego Zoo

00:14:16.900 --> 00:14:17.940
 and sort of observed them.

00:14:17.940 --> 00:14:19.380
 And so he was trying to do it properly,

00:14:19.380 --> 00:14:20.780
 he was trying to go in method.

00:14:20.780 --> 00:14:23.820
 Anyway, in 30 years, he was in 43 films,

00:14:23.820 --> 00:14:26.180
 39 of which involved him being a gorilla.

00:14:26.180 --> 00:14:27.020
 - Right.

00:14:27.020 --> 00:14:28.460
 - The others, he played two aliens,

00:14:28.460 --> 00:14:30.180
 one bear and one cannibal.

00:14:30.180 --> 00:14:31.860
 - Same suit with bits sewn onto it.

00:14:31.860 --> 00:14:32.700
 - Same suit.

00:14:32.700 --> 00:14:33.540
 - Oh, I don't know.

00:14:33.540 --> 00:14:34.620
 (laughing)

00:14:34.620 --> 00:14:35.460
 - It just sounds great.

00:14:35.460 --> 00:14:36.740
 He's the one called the Monster and the Girl,

00:14:36.740 --> 00:14:39.460
 where a gorilla receives the brain of a man

00:14:39.460 --> 00:14:40.620
 who is seeking revenge

00:14:40.620 --> 00:14:42.220
 because he was wrongfully executed.

00:14:42.220 --> 00:14:43.060
 - Right.

00:14:43.060 --> 00:14:43.900
 - Yeah.

00:14:43.900 --> 00:14:45.260
 - The brain goes into the gorilla.

00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:46.100
 - That's really good.

00:14:46.100 --> 00:14:48.380
 - I mean, I really hope Modern Hollywood

00:14:48.380 --> 00:14:51.300
 is still using the, well, he's got a suit.

00:14:51.300 --> 00:14:52.860
 (laughing)

00:14:52.860 --> 00:14:55.540
 - Andy Serkis just has a great costume like that.

00:14:55.540 --> 00:14:58.020
 - Well, that's how Downey Jr. got Iron Man.

00:14:58.020 --> 00:14:58.760
 (laughing)

00:14:58.760 --> 00:15:01.340
 (upbeat music)

00:15:01.340 --> 00:15:05.380
 - Okay, it is time for fact number two,

00:15:05.380 --> 00:15:06.700
 and that is my fact.

00:15:06.700 --> 00:15:09.020
 My fact this week is that the author,

00:15:09.020 --> 00:15:12.740
 Elizabeth Gaskell, died in the middle of saying,

00:15:12.740 --> 00:15:16.740
 "When I am dead, but only got as far as when..."

00:15:16.740 --> 00:15:18.540
 (laughing)

00:15:18.540 --> 00:15:20.180
 - So, how do people know?

00:15:20.180 --> 00:15:21.780
 (laughing)

00:15:21.780 --> 00:15:23.300
 - This is really interesting.

00:15:23.300 --> 00:15:24.940
 She, we should just say very quickly

00:15:24.940 --> 00:15:27.860
 before we get into it, this is Elizabeth Gaskell,

00:15:27.860 --> 00:15:29.900
 Mrs. Gaskell, as she was often known.

00:15:29.900 --> 00:15:31.020
 She was an English novelist.

00:15:31.020 --> 00:15:32.180
 She wrote short stories.

00:15:32.180 --> 00:15:34.620
 She was a biographer, most famously having written a book

00:15:34.620 --> 00:15:36.060
 about Charlotte Bronte.

00:15:36.060 --> 00:15:36.900
 Maybe we'll get onto that.

00:15:36.900 --> 00:15:37.940
 - Although that's certainly not like, you know,

00:15:37.940 --> 00:15:39.020
 she's most famously wrote.

00:15:39.020 --> 00:15:39.860
 - Yes, it really works in fiction.

00:15:39.860 --> 00:15:41.420
 - Yes, Mary Barton.

00:15:41.420 --> 00:15:43.900
 - Yes, she was one of our great Victorian novelists.

00:15:43.900 --> 00:15:46.500
 - But at the time, she was most famous

00:15:46.500 --> 00:15:47.340
 for writing biography.

00:15:47.340 --> 00:15:49.100
 - Her obituary basically said,

00:15:49.100 --> 00:15:50.700
 "Charlotte Bronte's biographer dead."

00:15:50.700 --> 00:15:51.540
 - Yes.

00:15:51.540 --> 00:15:52.380
 - When?

00:15:52.380 --> 00:15:53.620
 - When, exactly.

00:15:53.620 --> 00:15:57.460
 - So, what happened was, this is 1865.

00:15:57.460 --> 00:15:58.980
 She is 55 years old.

00:15:58.980 --> 00:16:01.700
 She's at her home, which is a sort of secret home

00:16:01.700 --> 00:16:02.820
 that she's purchased.

00:16:02.820 --> 00:16:04.860
 - Yeah, I feel like we'll go into that as that story.

00:16:04.860 --> 00:16:08.980
 - I'm just leaving some little plot moments as we go along.

00:16:08.980 --> 00:16:11.100
 So, she's at her house.

00:16:11.100 --> 00:16:12.340
 She's sitting with her daughters

00:16:12.340 --> 00:16:14.820
 and suddenly she keels over and she dies,

00:16:14.820 --> 00:16:16.740
 but she dies mid-anichthote.

00:16:16.740 --> 00:16:18.220
 And we know what happened

00:16:18.220 --> 00:16:20.580
 because of a reverend called Reverend Hawkes,

00:16:20.580 --> 00:16:23.180
 who recounted the story, as was told to him

00:16:23.180 --> 00:16:24.500
 by one of the daughters.

00:16:24.500 --> 00:16:26.660
 So, she was with her daughters and her son-in-law.

00:16:26.660 --> 00:16:28.780
 She was telling a story and she says,

00:16:28.780 --> 00:16:30.740
 "The judge said when,"

00:16:30.740 --> 00:16:32.780
 and then that's when she passed away.

00:16:32.780 --> 00:16:34.260
 Now, she was telling an anecdote.

00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:35.900
 Fortunately, one of the four people there

00:16:35.900 --> 00:16:37.700
 had already heard this anecdote,

00:16:37.700 --> 00:16:39.100
 presumably so many times

00:16:39.100 --> 00:16:41.500
 that they knew exactly what was coming next.

00:16:41.500 --> 00:16:43.380
 And the line that was meant to come next

00:16:43.380 --> 00:16:45.620
 was, "The judge said, 'When I'm dead,

00:16:45.620 --> 00:16:47.940
 'Lady Crompton can visit Rome.'"

00:16:47.940 --> 00:16:49.860
 A classic line.

00:16:49.860 --> 00:16:51.580
 - Yes, classic line.

00:16:51.580 --> 00:16:53.500
 - Everybody laughed.

00:16:53.500 --> 00:16:57.060
 I think you can see where she was going in the conversation

00:16:57.060 --> 00:16:58.900
 because a little bit of backstory is

00:16:58.900 --> 00:17:02.420
 that Justice Crompton had just died.

00:17:02.420 --> 00:17:04.380
 He was her son-in-law's dad

00:17:04.380 --> 00:17:05.820
 and I think her son-in-law's present.

00:17:05.820 --> 00:17:08.020
 So, the guy she's talking about

00:17:08.020 --> 00:17:09.780
 is the person who said, "When I am dead."

00:17:09.780 --> 00:17:11.780
 So, I imagine she was going on to say,

00:17:11.780 --> 00:17:15.900
 "So now, lucky lady Crompton can book her flight to Rome."

00:17:15.900 --> 00:17:17.380
 Because, you know, it was relevant.

00:17:17.380 --> 00:17:18.540
 It's funny 'cause he is dead,

00:17:18.540 --> 00:17:20.220
 so it's got a bit of gallows humor to it.

00:17:20.220 --> 00:17:22.940
 - You've sort of solved the end of the anecdote.

00:17:22.940 --> 00:17:24.020
 - I think that's what's happened.

00:17:24.020 --> 00:17:26.900
 Yeah, it's like Edwin Drude has finally been revealed.

00:17:26.900 --> 00:17:27.900
 - Thank God.

00:17:27.900 --> 00:17:32.060
 How great, though, to sort of not be lost on that last word.

00:17:32.060 --> 00:17:34.260
 Like, we should all practice our final words

00:17:34.260 --> 00:17:35.900
 with someone in confidence beforehand

00:17:35.900 --> 00:17:37.740
 so that if we do go mid-sentence,

00:17:37.740 --> 00:17:39.340
 I mean, I will be saying something

00:17:39.340 --> 00:17:41.140
 I've already said loads of times already

00:17:41.140 --> 00:17:44.620
 'cause I'm down to a limited stock of anecdotes now.

00:17:44.620 --> 00:17:45.820
 Just people know my things.

00:17:45.820 --> 00:17:47.180
 - Do you think it was a bit of a let down, though,

00:17:47.180 --> 00:17:49.340
 when they said, "Well, she started by saying

00:17:49.340 --> 00:17:51.300
 "wet," and then someone went, "No, no, actually,

00:17:51.300 --> 00:17:53.580
 "she's told that several times before."

00:17:53.580 --> 00:17:56.060
 - A bit of a bore, actually, Lizzie.

00:17:56.060 --> 00:17:57.780
 - Always whining about the same stuff.

00:17:57.780 --> 00:17:58.820
 That's probably why old people

00:17:58.820 --> 00:18:00.500
 repeat anecdotes all the time, isn't it?

00:18:00.500 --> 00:18:02.780
 Just to make sure that once they're saying their anecdote,

00:18:02.780 --> 00:18:04.300
 that we know where they were going with it.

00:18:04.300 --> 00:18:06.020
 - Very wise, yeah. - Yeah, that's very wise.

00:18:06.020 --> 00:18:07.700
 - She's, has anyone read this?

00:18:07.700 --> 00:18:09.180
 - I've read Mary Barton.

00:18:09.180 --> 00:18:10.020
 Thank you.

00:18:10.020 --> 00:18:11.180
 - You've read North and South.

00:18:11.180 --> 00:18:12.020
 - Thank you.

00:18:12.020 --> 00:18:13.140
 - I think I've read North and South.

00:18:13.140 --> 00:18:13.980
 Or Mary Barton.

00:18:13.980 --> 00:18:15.660
 - Or have you just seen the TV series?

00:18:15.660 --> 00:18:17.060
 - No, I'm gonna be a little bit heretical.

00:18:17.060 --> 00:18:18.460
 I don't think she's all that.

00:18:18.460 --> 00:18:20.020
 I mean, she's good.

00:18:20.020 --> 00:18:22.180
 They're good novels, but they're very Victorian.

00:18:22.180 --> 00:18:24.140
 They're a bit, you know, they haven't aged brilliantly.

00:18:24.140 --> 00:18:25.780
 - I think they've got, I think they really have.

00:18:25.780 --> 00:18:27.820
 I think she's much more radical than people.

00:18:27.820 --> 00:18:29.700
 - Yes, that's what I don't like, yeah, yeah.

00:18:29.700 --> 00:18:33.380
 - Mary Barton, it's a sort of a working class character,

00:18:33.380 --> 00:18:34.500
 and it's very much in that life,

00:18:34.500 --> 00:18:38.220
 which was, you know, not so much the dumb thing back then.

00:18:38.220 --> 00:18:39.500
 - I completely agree.

00:18:39.500 --> 00:18:42.700
 I think, like, her and Dickens are two people

00:18:42.700 --> 00:18:44.140
 who really engage with people

00:18:44.140 --> 00:18:46.740
 who are having a shit old time in life,

00:18:46.740 --> 00:18:48.900
 more than almost any other Victorian novelist, you know,

00:18:48.900 --> 00:18:51.140
 'cause they're all about factory workers,

00:18:51.140 --> 00:18:55.180
 the strife between bosses and laborers.

00:18:55.180 --> 00:18:56.380
 Not into that though, are you, Andy?

00:18:56.380 --> 00:18:57.700
 - I like reading about aristocrats

00:18:57.700 --> 00:18:59.420
 with minor social problems.

00:18:59.420 --> 00:19:00.340
 (all laughing)

00:19:00.340 --> 00:19:02.060
 That's my thing.

00:19:02.060 --> 00:19:03.740
 - 'Cause she did write about that stuff.

00:19:03.740 --> 00:19:04.980
 It was really controversial, wasn't it?

00:19:04.980 --> 00:19:07.380
 And in her community as well, particularly,

00:19:07.380 --> 00:19:09.060
 where she was representing these characters,

00:19:09.060 --> 00:19:12.340
 'cause I believe I actually haven't read any of her stuff,

00:19:12.340 --> 00:19:15.180
 but it sounds as if the other writers of the time

00:19:15.180 --> 00:19:16.540
 who were in the same field,

00:19:16.540 --> 00:19:19.220
 so Bronte, a friend of hers, Austin,

00:19:19.220 --> 00:19:21.580
 they would write about a period slightly gone,

00:19:21.580 --> 00:19:23.580
 whereas she was writing in the present,

00:19:23.580 --> 00:19:25.460
 and then that, so that was a bit more controversial.

00:19:25.460 --> 00:19:26.300
 And there's a few books.

00:19:26.300 --> 00:19:27.500
 She had one book called "Ruth,"

00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:29.060
 which was very controversial,

00:19:29.060 --> 00:19:32.020
 and they actually burnt copies in her local church.

00:19:32.020 --> 00:19:33.180
 - Yes, members of her own church.

00:19:33.180 --> 00:19:34.180
 - Yeah, which is. - Which is.

00:19:34.180 --> 00:19:35.260
 - Why did they do that?

00:19:35.260 --> 00:19:36.660
 - 'Cause it was debauched.

00:19:36.660 --> 00:19:38.020
 - It's about a fallen woman.

00:19:38.020 --> 00:19:39.660
 - Oh, yes, they should be about.

00:19:39.660 --> 00:19:42.380
 - I know how it's a threesome scene actually.

00:19:42.380 --> 00:19:44.260
 Wolfs dressed as gorillas.

00:19:44.260 --> 00:19:46.660
 - That's what fallen women do, yes.

00:19:46.660 --> 00:19:48.900
 - Gascall wasn't allowed into her husband's library.

00:19:48.900 --> 00:19:50.940
 He had to get books out for her.

00:19:50.940 --> 00:19:52.140
 It's very weird.

00:19:52.140 --> 00:19:52.980
 - Really? - Yeah.

00:19:52.980 --> 00:19:54.300
 - Local library, not like his personal.

00:19:54.300 --> 00:19:56.820
 Like, no, not his, she was allowed,

00:19:56.820 --> 00:19:59.020
 she was allowed the run of the house at home,

00:19:59.020 --> 00:19:59.860
 but no, he was a member of the library.

00:19:59.860 --> 00:20:01.980
 - She wasn't allowed his library, like Bluebeard.

00:20:01.980 --> 00:20:02.820
 - What's that?

00:20:02.820 --> 00:20:04.500
 - You know the tell of Bluebeard,

00:20:04.500 --> 00:20:06.380
 where he marries this young woman,

00:20:06.380 --> 00:20:08.780
 and he says, "You can go in any room you like,

00:20:08.780 --> 00:20:10.860
 "except for this one."

00:20:10.860 --> 00:20:12.300
 - You're talking about Beauty and the Beast.

00:20:12.300 --> 00:20:14.180
 - No, I'm not talking about Bluebeard.

00:20:14.180 --> 00:20:15.260
 - Are you talking about the pirate?

00:20:15.260 --> 00:20:16.100
 - What's in the room?

00:20:16.100 --> 00:20:16.940
 - No, everybody.

00:20:16.940 --> 00:20:17.780
 - Kurt Vonnegut novel?

00:20:17.780 --> 00:20:20.700
 - No, it's a very famous tale that none of you have heard of.

00:20:20.700 --> 00:20:21.540
 - I think I know what's in the room,

00:20:21.540 --> 00:20:23.660
 but you say it, you say it, what's in the room?

00:20:23.660 --> 00:20:26.580
 - So she finally, 'cause he keeps going away,

00:20:26.580 --> 00:20:28.300
 so she's wandering around all these rooms,

00:20:28.300 --> 00:20:29.900
 and she gets impatient.

00:20:29.900 --> 00:20:32.860
 She goes, "I just want to know what's in the mystery room."

00:20:32.860 --> 00:20:34.300
 So she uses the skeleton key.

00:20:34.300 --> 00:20:36.700
 I think it's the skeleton key, maybe I've embellished that.

00:20:36.700 --> 00:20:38.300
 And she opens it,

00:20:38.300 --> 00:20:41.740
 and inside are all the dead bodies of his previous wife.

00:20:41.740 --> 00:20:42.580
 - Oh!

00:20:42.580 --> 00:20:47.260
 - Don't draw attention to it, you idiot man.

00:20:47.260 --> 00:20:48.340
 But then he comes back, and he goes,

00:20:48.340 --> 00:20:51.460
 "Oh dear, looks like I'm gonna have to kill you too,

00:20:51.460 --> 00:20:52.700
 "because you opened the door."

00:20:52.700 --> 00:20:54.100
 - Another notch in the skeleton key.

00:20:54.100 --> 00:20:56.580
 - Yes, and the other notch is going to escape.

00:20:56.580 --> 00:20:58.140
 - Yes, it's a funny old story, isn't it?

00:20:58.140 --> 00:20:59.420
 - Where's it from?

00:20:59.420 --> 00:21:00.780
 - Is it an author we know?

00:21:00.780 --> 00:21:02.100
 Is it almost like a photo?

00:21:02.100 --> 00:21:05.100
 - No, it's very old, it's a very old tale.

00:21:05.100 --> 00:21:06.540
 - Right, I can't.

00:21:06.540 --> 00:21:08.540
 - That wasn't the case in Gaskell's husband's library,

00:21:08.540 --> 00:21:09.380
 as far as I know.

00:21:09.380 --> 00:21:11.620
 - Well, you don't know, because no one went in there.

00:21:11.620 --> 00:21:12.980
 - That's true.

00:21:12.980 --> 00:21:13.820
 - But the thing about her,

00:21:13.820 --> 00:21:16.180
 I think which kind of annoys people or bores at them,

00:21:16.180 --> 00:21:18.020
 is that she actually was really normal.

00:21:18.020 --> 00:21:18.980
 And the thing that's quite nice about her

00:21:18.980 --> 00:21:20.820
 is that she just basically had a really happy life.

00:21:20.820 --> 00:21:23.700
 She was quite conventional in how she lived, you know?

00:21:23.700 --> 00:21:24.860
 She married this vicar.

00:21:24.860 --> 00:21:26.580
 - Wait, or was she?

00:21:26.580 --> 00:21:30.020
 - Or what, do you know the hidden history of her orgies?

00:21:30.020 --> 00:21:31.420
 (laughing)

00:21:31.420 --> 00:21:32.660
 The mass orgies.

00:21:32.660 --> 00:21:35.900
 - Well, wasn't there a rumour going round when she died

00:21:35.900 --> 00:21:38.740
 that she and her husband were separated?

00:21:38.740 --> 00:21:41.060
 And that's why she was in the separate house.

00:21:41.060 --> 00:21:44.020
 - Well, I do think that that's got weight.

00:21:44.020 --> 00:21:46.300
 So I'm glad other people who aren't gossips like me

00:21:46.300 --> 00:21:48.220
 have said it, because I'm not a gossip.

00:21:48.220 --> 00:21:51.140
 - I only bring the fat, you're an intellectual.

00:21:51.140 --> 00:21:54.020
 - So separate house, she bought her own house.

00:21:54.020 --> 00:21:55.740
 - The house she dies in, yes.

00:21:55.740 --> 00:21:57.140
 - Without telling her husband.

00:21:57.140 --> 00:21:59.980
 - And the story is that it was a surprise for her husband,

00:21:59.980 --> 00:22:01.500
 like a retirement home.

00:22:01.500 --> 00:22:02.860
 Oh, we're going to move to the country,

00:22:02.860 --> 00:22:04.740
 this lovely mansion, and she was in the house

00:22:04.740 --> 00:22:05.940
 with all her daughters saying,

00:22:05.940 --> 00:22:07.940
 isn't daddy going to be delighted?

00:22:07.940 --> 00:22:08.780
 But I agree it's a bit--

00:22:08.780 --> 00:22:09.940
 - So all the children are there as well?

00:22:09.940 --> 00:22:12.980
 - Yeah, I mean, which is why slightly the story suggests

00:22:12.980 --> 00:22:14.380
 that that is what was going on.

00:22:14.380 --> 00:22:17.340
 But is he at home at the breakfast table at the house?

00:22:17.340 --> 00:22:19.860
 Well, I think it's very quiet this morning, isn't it?

00:22:19.860 --> 00:22:21.660
 - God, they're sleeping in today.

00:22:21.660 --> 00:22:23.700
 I bet they were separated.

00:22:23.700 --> 00:22:24.540
 - Okay, do you reckon?

00:22:24.540 --> 00:22:25.860
 - Yeah, I think so.

00:22:25.860 --> 00:22:28.740
 - Or it was a secret death house.

00:22:28.740 --> 00:22:30.220
 Sorry.

00:22:30.220 --> 00:22:32.500
 She thought my time is up.

00:22:32.500 --> 00:22:36.740
 I like how animals like to go and die under a log

00:22:36.740 --> 00:22:37.580
 or something.

00:22:37.580 --> 00:22:39.180
 She thought I'm going to die in a house

00:22:39.180 --> 00:22:42.380
 that's a huge faff to buy a full house, isn't it?

00:22:42.380 --> 00:22:43.460
 - Yeah, but houses are cheaper then.

00:22:43.460 --> 00:22:46.100
 I think it was probably easier to do.

00:22:46.100 --> 00:22:49.100
 A few years ago, a university got a collection of letters

00:22:49.100 --> 00:22:50.740
 that were written by someone who was friends

00:22:50.740 --> 00:22:52.900
 with Elizabeth Gaskell and they were having correspondence

00:22:52.900 --> 00:22:56.260
 and in it, Gaskell predicted her death that year.

00:22:56.260 --> 00:22:57.500
 She said to her, I'm not going to make it

00:22:57.500 --> 00:22:58.340
 to the end of the year.

00:22:58.340 --> 00:22:59.900
 - So I'd better buy a house.

00:22:59.900 --> 00:23:02.540
 - Yeah, but perhaps she didn't know

00:23:02.540 --> 00:23:04.500
 that she was doing so well.

00:23:04.500 --> 00:23:05.460
 She could sense it.

00:23:05.460 --> 00:23:08.020
 - There is an argument in Gaskell's life.

00:23:08.020 --> 00:23:09.900
 So the house, the secret house that she bought

00:23:09.900 --> 00:23:13.100
 was in Alton, in Hampshire, which is where--

00:23:13.100 --> 00:23:14.780
 - Jane Austen lived, yeah.

00:23:14.780 --> 00:23:16.580
 - For the last years of her life.

00:23:16.580 --> 00:23:17.860
 - And Alton Towers, is that there?

00:23:17.860 --> 00:23:18.940
 - No, it's in a completely different place.

00:23:18.940 --> 00:23:20.580
 It's hundreds of miles away.

00:23:20.580 --> 00:23:24.500
 But Gaskell grew up in Stratford-upon-Avon,

00:23:24.500 --> 00:23:25.780
 home of--

00:23:25.780 --> 00:23:27.100
 - Shakespeare.

00:23:27.100 --> 00:23:28.660
 - So is this a lay line?

00:23:28.660 --> 00:23:30.060
 - You guys weren't quick enough.

00:23:30.060 --> 00:23:31.820
 (laughing)

00:23:31.820 --> 00:23:33.460
 - So is this an argument for lay lines

00:23:33.460 --> 00:23:35.220
 in terms of literary creativity, probably?

00:23:35.220 --> 00:23:36.740
 - There's certainly something going on, isn't there?

00:23:36.740 --> 00:23:38.460
 - Yeah, certainly, I think.

00:23:38.460 --> 00:23:40.620
 Do you know she gave us the word "squiffy" to mean drunk?

00:23:40.620 --> 00:23:41.460
 - Really?

00:23:41.460 --> 00:23:42.300
 - Oh, brilliant.

00:23:42.300 --> 00:23:44.100
 I know, I love that fact.

00:23:44.100 --> 00:23:45.740
 - I love the sound of her, I have to say.

00:23:45.740 --> 00:23:48.020
 As in, when you read about her social life,

00:23:48.020 --> 00:23:50.300
 there is this comparison, I think, with Dickens,

00:23:50.300 --> 00:23:52.960
 where Dickens was partying all the time.

00:23:52.960 --> 00:23:53.860
 He was everywhere.

00:23:53.860 --> 00:23:55.300
 He went around the world.

00:23:55.300 --> 00:23:56.700
 That's exactly what Gaskell did

00:23:56.700 --> 00:23:58.020
 in a time where it felt like

00:23:58.020 --> 00:23:59.180
 that would have been much harder.

00:23:59.180 --> 00:24:01.100
 She was a mother of how many children

00:24:01.100 --> 00:24:01.940
 did she have in total?

00:24:01.940 --> 00:24:02.780
 - Five.

00:24:02.780 --> 00:24:03.620
 - I think she was pregnant seven times.

00:24:03.620 --> 00:24:04.620
 A couple of the children didn't live.

00:24:04.620 --> 00:24:05.580
 - Okay, right.

00:24:05.580 --> 00:24:07.460
 Five daughters and one son, yeah, survived,

00:24:07.460 --> 00:24:08.300
 which is quite a lot.

00:24:08.300 --> 00:24:09.140
 - That is, yeah.

00:24:09.140 --> 00:24:11.660
 She was writing, she wrote quite a few novels,

00:24:11.660 --> 00:24:13.500
 a lot of short stories, a biography.

00:24:13.500 --> 00:24:14.860
 She traveled the world.

00:24:14.860 --> 00:24:17.060
 She was constantly said to be dancing

00:24:17.060 --> 00:24:18.140
 half the night at parties.

00:24:18.140 --> 00:24:19.740
 She was a real socialite.

00:24:19.740 --> 00:24:21.020
 I think she sounds really fun.

00:24:21.020 --> 00:24:22.820
 - I think you would have gotten along with her very well.

00:24:22.820 --> 00:24:24.340
 - Yeah, it feels like it. - It was a real butterfly.

00:24:24.340 --> 00:24:26.220
 - She even wrote one of her novels

00:24:26.220 --> 00:24:27.940
 while she was staying with Florence Nightingale.

00:24:27.940 --> 00:24:30.580
 Like, she just touches all these little elements

00:24:30.580 --> 00:24:32.540
 of the past, which I really love.

00:24:32.540 --> 00:24:34.080
 - She sounds like someone who deserves

00:24:34.080 --> 00:24:35.580
 to have been let in the library.

00:24:35.580 --> 00:24:36.420
 - Yeah. - Yeah.

00:24:36.420 --> 00:24:37.260
 - I don't know though.

00:24:37.260 --> 00:24:38.100
 - I know.

00:24:38.100 --> 00:24:38.940
 - It's a slippery slope, isn't it?

00:24:38.940 --> 00:24:41.660
 - I think she should have been allowed in that library.

00:24:41.660 --> 00:24:43.700
 - You let them in libraries one day, you know, the next day.

00:24:43.700 --> 00:24:45.100
 - They just go in there willy-nilly.

00:24:45.100 --> 00:24:45.940
 - Yeah, exactly.

00:24:45.940 --> 00:24:47.020
 - It's like getting squiffy.

00:24:47.020 --> 00:24:49.380
 - I have another theory about her

00:24:49.380 --> 00:24:51.340
 that I think we should spread this gossip.

00:24:51.340 --> 00:24:53.900
 Her brother, John, and have you read about him?

00:24:53.900 --> 00:24:55.900
 He was seven years older than her.

00:24:55.900 --> 00:24:57.900
 So she had, her mom died when she was one

00:24:57.900 --> 00:24:59.940
 and she was sent to live with an aunt who she loved

00:24:59.940 --> 00:25:02.540
 and she lived in this very female dominated community.

00:25:02.540 --> 00:25:03.740
 It was all women.

00:25:03.740 --> 00:25:05.240
 But she did have this older brother

00:25:05.240 --> 00:25:06.880
 who still lived with her dad and they wrote

00:25:06.880 --> 00:25:09.480
 to each other a lot and he was really fond of her.

00:25:09.480 --> 00:25:11.400
 And then he joined the merchant navy

00:25:11.400 --> 00:25:13.320
 and they kept writing to each other.

00:25:13.320 --> 00:25:15.320
 And then he just vanishes.

00:25:15.320 --> 00:25:17.720
 And everyone says he was either abducted by pirates

00:25:17.720 --> 00:25:20.280
 in India or his ship sank.

00:25:20.280 --> 00:25:23.360
 But she, after writing the years, she's 17.

00:25:23.360 --> 00:25:24.200
 - Yeah.

00:25:24.200 --> 00:25:26.700
 (laughing)

00:25:26.700 --> 00:25:28.640
 - Bluebeard, yes, kidnapped.

00:25:28.640 --> 00:25:31.920
 - A bluebeard and a blackbeard, brothers or friends,

00:25:31.920 --> 00:25:33.280
 they must know each other.

00:25:33.280 --> 00:25:35.020
 - They're naughty cousins.

00:25:35.020 --> 00:25:37.260
 (laughing)

00:25:37.260 --> 00:25:41.620
 - So, yes, it's vicious.

00:25:41.620 --> 00:25:42.460
 And she never mentioned it.

00:25:42.460 --> 00:25:45.260
 She never mentioned him to her kids except to say,

00:25:45.260 --> 00:25:46.800
 "Oh, I don't really remember him."

00:25:46.800 --> 00:25:47.640
 - Really?

00:25:47.640 --> 00:25:48.460
 - Of course you'd remember him.

00:25:48.460 --> 00:25:49.620
 - Too painful or?

00:25:49.620 --> 00:25:50.460
 - Well, I don't know.

00:25:50.460 --> 00:25:51.300
 - What's your theory?

00:25:51.300 --> 00:25:53.060
 You seem to be driving at something here, Anna.

00:25:53.060 --> 00:25:53.900
 - I think-

00:25:53.900 --> 00:25:54.900
 - Is he in the library?

00:25:54.900 --> 00:25:58.180
 - I think his corpse was on the shelves.

00:25:58.180 --> 00:26:00.460
 I think maybe he ran away with like an Indian lady

00:26:00.460 --> 00:26:03.360
 and told only her and she can never tell anyone.

00:26:03.360 --> 00:26:04.400
 - That's a good theory.

00:26:04.400 --> 00:26:05.240
 - Yeah, I like that.

00:26:05.240 --> 00:26:07.880
 - Just on people who wrote anonymously.

00:26:07.880 --> 00:26:11.520
 'Cause Gaskell was always, by a lady,

00:26:11.520 --> 00:26:13.320
 would appear on her title pages.

00:26:13.320 --> 00:26:15.360
 I think she was Mrs. Gaskell later in her career.

00:26:15.360 --> 00:26:18.200
 But I didn't really realize how common this was.

00:26:18.200 --> 00:26:22.720
 So between 1750 and 1790, 80% of all novels

00:26:22.720 --> 00:26:25.360
 did not list an author on the title page.

00:26:25.360 --> 00:26:28.080
 Male and female writers, it just wasn't a thing.

00:26:28.080 --> 00:26:31.060
 For women, it was because it was a bit risqué

00:26:31.060 --> 00:26:31.900
 to be writing a novel.

00:26:31.900 --> 00:26:33.600
 It was too similar to prostitution,

00:26:33.600 --> 00:26:36.820
 which I mean, that's genuinely the theory I wrote.

00:26:36.820 --> 00:26:38.900
 But by a lady was a good phrase to use

00:26:38.900 --> 00:26:40.700
 because it showed that the author

00:26:40.700 --> 00:26:42.740
 was someone of a decent class.

00:26:42.740 --> 00:26:45.240
 So Jane Austen was by a lady

00:26:45.240 --> 00:26:47.100
 and then later on by the same lady

00:26:47.100 --> 00:26:49.060
 who brought you sense and sensibility.

00:26:49.060 --> 00:26:50.700
 I was genuinely at that.

00:26:50.700 --> 00:26:53.820
 And she never saw her own name on a title page, Jane Austen.

00:26:53.820 --> 00:26:54.760
 She's kind of tragic.

00:26:54.760 --> 00:26:56.100
 - Yeah, it's sad.

00:26:56.100 --> 00:26:57.140
 Do you think other books at the time

00:26:57.140 --> 00:26:59.040
 were written by a different lady?

00:26:59.040 --> 00:27:00.800
 (all laughing)

00:27:00.800 --> 00:27:01.700
 - Not that lady.

00:27:01.700 --> 00:27:03.320
 I can't believe it's not a lady.

00:27:03.320 --> 00:27:04.800
 Yeah.

00:27:04.800 --> 00:27:07.600
 But all of it, like Tristan Shandy, Byron stuff,

00:27:07.600 --> 00:27:09.260
 Jonathan Swift, it's all anonymous.

00:27:09.260 --> 00:27:10.760
 - Really? - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:27:10.760 --> 00:27:12.280
 - 'Cause the novel was quite new then, wasn't it?

00:27:12.280 --> 00:27:13.280
 Maybe it was still a bit like,

00:27:13.280 --> 00:27:15.400
 oh, this might not go down very well in history.

00:27:15.400 --> 00:27:16.560
 - It was risqué, definitely.

00:27:16.560 --> 00:27:18.160
 And it was quite fun as well.

00:27:18.160 --> 00:27:20.320
 So Jonathan Swift, he sent his stuff

00:27:20.320 --> 00:27:22.240
 to a publisher via someone else.

00:27:22.240 --> 00:27:24.640
 So there was no way of tracing it back to him.

00:27:24.640 --> 00:27:26.040
 - Really? - Yeah, yeah.

00:27:26.040 --> 00:27:27.180
 - And then when the printer said,

00:27:27.180 --> 00:27:29.180
 "Look, who is the author of 'Gulliver's Travels'?"

00:27:29.180 --> 00:27:30.940
 Swift and his friend, Alexander Pope,

00:27:30.940 --> 00:27:33.220
 they pretended, "I don't know, I don't know who wrote this."

00:27:33.220 --> 00:27:35.100
 They would even write letters to each other privately,

00:27:35.100 --> 00:27:37.780
 saying, "Who wrote this 'Gulliver's Travels' book?"

00:27:37.780 --> 00:27:39.380
 Completely between themselves.

00:27:39.380 --> 00:27:41.100
 - Yeah. - "I don't know.

00:27:41.100 --> 00:27:42.420
 It's so funny."

00:27:42.420 --> 00:27:43.860
 They just, it was a bit of a game, you know?

00:27:43.860 --> 00:27:45.620
 - But was there a royalty thing

00:27:45.620 --> 00:27:47.620
 that they would still have in place?

00:27:47.620 --> 00:27:49.780
 - Yeah, I guess you could be paid anonymously

00:27:49.780 --> 00:27:50.980
 quite easily at the time.

00:27:50.980 --> 00:27:53.820
 - There's just one person who's called like Anna Lady,

00:27:53.820 --> 00:27:57.600
 who's just funneling all the money accidentally sent out.

00:27:57.600 --> 00:27:59.860
 (laughing)

00:27:59.860 --> 00:28:02.960
 - Gaskell obviously gave all her money to her husband

00:28:02.960 --> 00:28:05.360
 at first, and in fact, I think it went to him automatically

00:28:05.360 --> 00:28:07.880
 'cause married women weren't allowed to earn money.

00:28:07.880 --> 00:28:10.160
 - You really don't approve of this husband, I tell you.

00:28:10.160 --> 00:28:12.120
 He came from his library.

00:28:12.120 --> 00:28:15.280
 - Apparently it was very affectionate.

00:28:15.280 --> 00:28:17.340
 I was listening to a--

00:28:17.340 --> 00:28:19.120
 - And that's why she bought a secret house.

00:28:19.120 --> 00:28:20.320
 (laughing)

00:28:20.320 --> 00:28:21.760
 - I think it was a little joke.

00:28:21.760 --> 00:28:23.320
 He was the one who suggested she write

00:28:23.320 --> 00:28:25.660
 to get over the death of her one-year-old son

00:28:25.660 --> 00:28:27.520
 who very sadly died, and he said,

00:28:27.520 --> 00:28:29.780
 "As to help you with grieving, write a novel."

00:28:29.780 --> 00:28:31.060
 Probably not suspecting she was gonna become

00:28:31.060 --> 00:28:32.700
 a world famous novelist.

00:28:32.700 --> 00:28:35.060
 And yes, when she got paid, it went straight to him,

00:28:35.060 --> 00:28:37.380
 and he sort of jokely pocketed it saying,

00:28:37.380 --> 00:28:39.180
 "Well, you know, women shouldn't be earning

00:28:39.180 --> 00:28:41.060
 "or in control of the purse strings, should they?

00:28:41.060 --> 00:28:42.820
 "I'll give you some pocket money."

00:28:42.820 --> 00:28:44.540
 But I think it was all meant--

00:28:44.540 --> 00:28:45.380
 - Was he saying that?

00:28:45.380 --> 00:28:46.700
 - All meant to Jess, too.

00:28:46.700 --> 00:28:48.540
 It was all meant to Jess.

00:28:48.540 --> 00:28:49.380
 - It was a different time.

00:28:49.380 --> 00:28:51.580
 It's so hard to know when it's written, isn't it?

00:28:51.580 --> 00:28:52.860
 You didn't know the tone.

00:28:52.860 --> 00:28:55.320
 - Yeah, they needed more emojis, I think.

00:28:55.320 --> 00:28:57.560
 (laughing)

00:28:57.560 --> 00:28:59.160
 - How much of history would be different

00:28:59.160 --> 00:29:00.400
 if emojis existed?

00:29:00.400 --> 00:29:02.320
 (laughing)

00:29:02.320 --> 00:29:03.520
 - I have nothing to offer but blood,

00:29:03.520 --> 00:29:04.720
 toil, tears, and sweat.

00:29:04.720 --> 00:29:05.560
 Winky.

00:29:05.560 --> 00:29:07.400
 (laughing)

00:29:07.400 --> 00:29:09.980
 (upbeat music)

00:29:09.980 --> 00:29:14.080
 - Okay, it is time for fact number three,

00:29:14.080 --> 00:29:15.720
 and that is Anna.

00:29:15.720 --> 00:29:18.720
 - My fact this week is that one of Ovid's tips

00:29:18.720 --> 00:29:20.920
 for seducing a woman you fancied

00:29:20.920 --> 00:29:23.700
 was to pretend you'd seen dust on her cleavage

00:29:23.700 --> 00:29:25.380
 and then go to brush it off.

00:29:25.380 --> 00:29:26.940
 - It's a great line, isn't it?

00:29:26.940 --> 00:29:29.100
 Oh, you've got a very dusty cleavage.

00:29:29.100 --> 00:29:29.940
 (laughing)

00:29:29.940 --> 00:29:31.140
 It's what every woman wants to hear.

00:29:31.140 --> 00:29:31.980
 - Yeah.

00:29:31.980 --> 00:29:34.160
 - Anna, when you say go to brush it off,

00:29:34.160 --> 00:29:35.780
 follow through and actually brush it off?

00:29:35.780 --> 00:29:36.620
 - Follow through, yes.

00:29:36.620 --> 00:29:38.380
 So these were his exact words.

00:29:38.380 --> 00:29:39.220
 - Follow.

00:29:39.220 --> 00:29:41.140
 - Go to and then complete the brush.

00:29:41.140 --> 00:29:41.980
 - Complete.

00:29:41.980 --> 00:29:44.100
 - Do you think it's like an updated thing of the,

00:29:44.100 --> 00:29:46.200
 no, sorry, a down-dated thing?

00:29:46.200 --> 00:29:47.540
 (laughing)

00:29:47.540 --> 00:29:49.420
 Because now it's, if you've got an eyelash,

00:29:49.420 --> 00:29:51.440
 oh, you've got an eyelash on your cheek, isn't it?

00:29:51.440 --> 00:29:54.000
 And then the man like removes the eyelash.

00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:55.720
 - You know this man, come on.

00:29:55.720 --> 00:29:57.200
 - I have a pocket full of eyelashes

00:29:57.200 --> 00:29:59.680
 that I try and subtly sprinkle onto people's cheeks.

00:29:59.680 --> 00:30:00.520
 - Yeah, that's true.

00:30:00.520 --> 00:30:01.600
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:30:01.600 --> 00:30:03.840
 - Absolute classic, absolute classic.

00:30:03.840 --> 00:30:04.680
 - Have you had that tried on you?

00:30:04.680 --> 00:30:05.520
 Is that, does it work?

00:30:05.520 --> 00:30:07.340
 - Oh, you've got an eyelash on your...

00:30:07.340 --> 00:30:08.680
 (laughing)

00:30:08.680 --> 00:30:10.800
 And then they lift it off your face.

00:30:10.800 --> 00:30:12.480
 - What harm is that eyelash doing there?

00:30:12.480 --> 00:30:14.240
 - And then they go take a, make a wish.

00:30:14.240 --> 00:30:15.240
 So maybe it's the same.

00:30:15.240 --> 00:30:17.480
 It was like, take you, you've got some dust

00:30:17.480 --> 00:30:18.520
 on your cleavage.

00:30:18.520 --> 00:30:21.320
 And then they hold it out going, make a wish.

00:30:21.320 --> 00:30:23.580
 - Blow on it like a dandelion.

00:30:23.580 --> 00:30:26.500
 I think this book of ours might contain a lot of things

00:30:26.500 --> 00:30:27.620
 that you guys could try out.

00:30:27.620 --> 00:30:29.220
 And I'd love to hear the results.

00:30:29.220 --> 00:30:31.300
 So this is a book called "Ars Amatoria"

00:30:31.300 --> 00:30:33.880
 and Ovid was a Roman writer.

00:30:33.880 --> 00:30:36.640
 He wrote this in year two AD.

00:30:36.640 --> 00:30:37.480
 - And it got in early.

00:30:37.480 --> 00:30:38.320
 - Box fresh.

00:30:38.320 --> 00:30:42.220
 - It got in early, so couple of millennia ago.

00:30:42.220 --> 00:30:44.780
 His exact words were, as often happens,

00:30:44.780 --> 00:30:47.020
 if perchance, a little dust should fall

00:30:47.020 --> 00:30:48.340
 on the bosom of the fair,

00:30:48.340 --> 00:30:50.600
 it must be brushed off with your fingers.

00:30:50.600 --> 00:30:52.800
 And if there should be no dust,

00:30:52.800 --> 00:30:55.020
 still brush off that none.

00:30:55.020 --> 00:30:57.820
 - It would work for me.

00:30:57.820 --> 00:30:59.520
 (laughing)

00:30:59.520 --> 00:31:01.040
 I'd like it.

00:31:01.040 --> 00:31:03.920
 - He has so much good stuff in there.

00:31:03.920 --> 00:31:05.880
 Oh, he also said, "Let it be your object

00:31:05.880 --> 00:31:08.940
 to please the husband of the fair one that you fancy."

00:31:08.940 --> 00:31:10.160
 I suppose we're assuming.

00:31:10.160 --> 00:31:12.240
 - Oh, this is naughty.

00:31:12.240 --> 00:31:13.520
 - Because once made a friend,

00:31:13.520 --> 00:31:16.040
 he will be more serviceable for your designs.

00:31:16.040 --> 00:31:19.020
 So I think you'll get invitations to the house

00:31:19.020 --> 00:31:20.500
 a little bit more.

00:31:20.500 --> 00:31:23.100
 - Not like come in and have a hairy threesome.

00:31:23.100 --> 00:31:23.940
 - No.

00:31:23.940 --> 00:31:25.000
 - No, he did specify that.

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:26.900
 (laughing)

00:31:26.900 --> 00:31:30.660
 - Specify no bad gorilla costumes and no threesome.

00:31:30.660 --> 00:31:34.820
 - I mean, he was a very risque writer at the time.

00:31:34.820 --> 00:31:36.860
 He was, what's the word?

00:31:36.860 --> 00:31:39.340
 He was not evicted, he was deported.

00:31:39.340 --> 00:31:40.180
 - Yeah.

00:31:40.180 --> 00:31:41.020
 - He was banned.

00:31:41.020 --> 00:31:41.860
 - Exiled.

00:31:41.860 --> 00:31:44.780
 - Exiled to the worst place in the world at the time.

00:31:44.780 --> 00:31:47.360
 He claimed seems to have been a completely normal city

00:31:47.360 --> 00:31:48.320
 in modern day Romania,

00:31:48.320 --> 00:31:50.880
 but compared with Rome, I guess it was rubbish.

00:31:50.880 --> 00:31:51.720
 - Okay.

00:31:51.720 --> 00:31:53.360
 - And for the last 10 years of his life,

00:31:53.360 --> 00:31:55.520
 he spent there writing the "Tristii",

00:31:55.520 --> 00:31:58.120
 which were basically sad letters saying,

00:31:58.120 --> 00:31:59.800
 "Please can I come back to Rome?"

00:31:59.800 --> 00:32:02.080
 To everyone he knew in Rome, including the emperor.

00:32:02.080 --> 00:32:03.600
 But I think he was evicted because he was,

00:32:03.600 --> 00:32:04.440
 he was quite a libidness,

00:32:04.440 --> 00:32:05.800
 quite a licentious writer,

00:32:05.800 --> 00:32:07.760
 lots of sexy stuff in the Ars Amatoria,

00:32:07.760 --> 00:32:09.240
 lots of love poetry,

00:32:09.240 --> 00:32:12.000
 but it's quite mysterious why he was actually kicked out.

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:12.840
 - Yeah, we don't know.

00:32:12.840 --> 00:32:14.160
 - No one knows for sure.

00:32:14.160 --> 00:32:15.660
 - There might have been a scandal

00:32:15.660 --> 00:32:18.140
 involving the daughter of the emperor, Augustus.

00:32:18.140 --> 00:32:19.380
 - Yeah, Junior.

00:32:19.380 --> 00:32:20.700
 I think maybe it was the scandal.

00:32:20.700 --> 00:32:22.700
 - It might have been a general back-to-basics campaign

00:32:22.700 --> 00:32:23.700
 that Augustus was running,

00:32:23.700 --> 00:32:25.860
 'cause Rome was getting a little bit CD

00:32:25.860 --> 00:32:27.220
 and Augustus didn't really like that.

00:32:27.220 --> 00:32:28.900
 And he was trying to raise public morals a bit

00:32:28.900 --> 00:32:30.580
 and Ovid was stood out there saying,

00:32:30.580 --> 00:32:32.460
 "Get Dustin", you know, all of that.

00:32:32.460 --> 00:32:34.220
 So it's really unclear why he was.

00:32:34.220 --> 00:32:35.220
 - Get Dustin.

00:32:35.220 --> 00:32:36.660
 (all laughing)

00:32:36.660 --> 00:32:37.500
 - Bang!

00:32:37.500 --> 00:32:41.020
 - Man for some Dustin, these ladies.

00:32:41.020 --> 00:32:43.860
 - So there were three volumes of this book, right?

00:32:43.860 --> 00:32:45.840
 The Art of Love, first one, which teaches the reader

00:32:45.840 --> 00:32:47.240
 how to seduce a woman.

00:32:47.240 --> 00:32:50.040
 The second one then is, okay, okay, you've got her.

00:32:50.040 --> 00:32:52.720
 Now, how do you continue to seduce her?

00:32:52.720 --> 00:32:53.840
 Which is very interesting.

00:32:53.840 --> 00:32:56.680
 And then the third one is how for women,

00:32:56.680 --> 00:32:57.860
 so there must have been feedback going,

00:32:57.860 --> 00:32:59.880
 "Hey, this is all very man-based.

00:32:59.880 --> 00:33:01.120
 Can we get the opposite version?"

00:33:01.120 --> 00:33:03.960
 So he wrote, "How a woman can seduce a man."

00:33:03.960 --> 00:33:06.320
 But the fourth volume, which is a separate book,

00:33:06.320 --> 00:33:07.400
 is the most exciting one.

00:33:07.400 --> 00:33:08.560
 - The Marsupials.

00:33:08.560 --> 00:33:09.400
 - Yeah, lover.

00:33:09.400 --> 00:33:10.240
 (all laughing)

00:33:10.240 --> 00:33:12.280
 - Develop a pouch in your front.

00:33:12.280 --> 00:33:13.840
 (all laughing)

00:33:13.840 --> 00:33:16.020
 - Remedia Amoris.

00:33:16.020 --> 00:33:19.220
 This is the book of how if it's unrequited love,

00:33:19.220 --> 00:33:20.940
 do you stop loving a person?

00:33:20.940 --> 00:33:23.020
 What a great idea for a book.

00:33:23.020 --> 00:33:24.020
 - It's a terrific sequel.

00:33:24.020 --> 00:33:24.860
 - It's fantastic.

00:33:24.860 --> 00:33:26.980
 - The publishers must have been absolutely chuffed.

00:33:26.980 --> 00:33:28.980
 It's got great advice in it as well, the Remedia.

00:33:28.980 --> 00:33:30.860
 There's, "Join the Army."

00:33:30.860 --> 00:33:31.940
 - Oh, boom.

00:33:31.940 --> 00:33:33.340
 - Become a lawyer.

00:33:33.340 --> 00:33:34.900
 Become a farmer.

00:33:34.900 --> 00:33:35.980
 Get a hobby.

00:33:35.980 --> 00:33:38.740
 - How is this supposed to get you out of unrequited love?

00:33:38.740 --> 00:33:40.460
 - I think it's when your heart broken,

00:33:40.460 --> 00:33:41.380
 it's how to get over it.

00:33:41.380 --> 00:33:42.220
 - It's distraction.

00:33:42.220 --> 00:33:45.320
 - It's not like my dad gave me some advice

00:33:45.320 --> 00:33:46.160
 once when I was a teenager

00:33:46.160 --> 00:33:48.420
 and I was very heartbroken over a boy

00:33:48.420 --> 00:33:49.920
 who did not love me back.

00:33:49.920 --> 00:33:54.740
 And my dad said, "Just picture him on the loo."

00:33:54.740 --> 00:33:55.580
 - Oh, wow.

00:33:55.580 --> 00:33:56.420
 - Really?

00:33:56.420 --> 00:33:57.680
 - I can see that going in there.

00:33:57.680 --> 00:33:59.460
 - Well, there is a similar-ish thing.

00:33:59.460 --> 00:34:00.300
 - Yeah, it is.

00:34:00.300 --> 00:34:01.140
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:34:01.140 --> 00:34:02.140
 Did it work?

00:34:02.140 --> 00:34:03.840
 - No, and I said to Dad,

00:34:03.840 --> 00:34:07.520
 'cause he said, "I was in love with Sarah."

00:34:07.520 --> 00:34:08.360
 I can't remember her's name.

00:34:08.360 --> 00:34:10.340
 There's a girl he was in love with when he was a teenager.

00:34:10.340 --> 00:34:11.180
 And he said, "And I..."

00:34:11.180 --> 00:34:12.020
 - I'm gonna shout at her right now.

00:34:12.020 --> 00:34:13.840
 (all laughing)

00:34:13.840 --> 00:34:15.780
 - Cleveland, Sarah Cleveland.

00:34:15.780 --> 00:34:16.620
 - Oh, thank God, great.

00:34:16.620 --> 00:34:17.880
 Now we're legally secure, yeah.

00:34:17.880 --> 00:34:19.380
 - So I was in love with Sarah Cleveland

00:34:19.380 --> 00:34:22.420
 and I would picture her on the loo to get me over her.

00:34:22.420 --> 00:34:23.260
 And I said, "Did it work?"

00:34:23.260 --> 00:34:24.580
 And he went, "No."

00:34:24.580 --> 00:34:25.420
 - Right.

00:34:25.420 --> 00:34:26.900
 - If anything, I developed a weird fetish

00:34:26.900 --> 00:34:28.940
 that has dawned my life ever since.

00:34:28.940 --> 00:34:30.300
 (all laughing)

00:34:30.300 --> 00:34:32.580
 - Well, okay, well, Ovid wrote,

00:34:32.580 --> 00:34:35.340
 "Maybe this would have worked alternatively."

00:34:35.340 --> 00:34:36.780
 And this is about if you're a man

00:34:36.780 --> 00:34:38.780
 and you had your heart broken by a woman,

00:34:38.780 --> 00:34:41.140
 go and see her unannounced, right?

00:34:41.140 --> 00:34:41.980
 - Early in the morning.

00:34:41.980 --> 00:34:42.980
 - When she hasn't got her makeup on.

00:34:42.980 --> 00:34:44.340
 - When she hasn't got her makeup on.

00:34:44.340 --> 00:34:45.180
 And you'll be reminded.

00:34:45.180 --> 00:34:46.020
 - She's got two.

00:34:46.020 --> 00:34:46.860
 (all laughing)

00:34:46.860 --> 00:34:49.180
 - She does, don't I claim it?

00:34:49.180 --> 00:34:51.100
 - They need a broom to get that out of love.

00:34:51.100 --> 00:34:52.740
 (all laughing)

00:34:52.740 --> 00:34:56.820
 - Yeah, he also, the classic kind of like teenage movie

00:34:56.820 --> 00:34:59.660
 techniques burn all the items that are associated with them.

00:34:59.660 --> 00:35:01.940
 So sit with a fire and throw the letters in,

00:35:01.940 --> 00:35:04.100
 the love letters and the bits of clothing

00:35:04.100 --> 00:35:06.300
 or whatever's been left over in your house.

00:35:06.300 --> 00:35:08.300
 Do that and, but what a great book.

00:35:08.300 --> 00:35:10.340
 What a forward thinking book.

00:35:10.340 --> 00:35:12.780
 - He had to, yes, there are some ropey bits of it.

00:35:12.780 --> 00:35:14.780
 Maybe it doesn't stand up to a lot of feminism,

00:35:14.780 --> 00:35:16.620
 but he was a very pro makeup, actually.

00:35:16.620 --> 00:35:19.380
 He wrote a whole separate book on why women

00:35:19.380 --> 00:35:21.940
 should wear makeup because there was a lot of pushback

00:35:21.940 --> 00:35:24.420
 in society at the time about how women were

00:35:24.420 --> 00:35:26.500
 overdressing their faces with makeup.

00:35:26.500 --> 00:35:27.900
 - Augustus, back to basics.

00:35:27.900 --> 00:35:29.340
 Let's take off that thick slap.

00:35:29.340 --> 00:35:30.180
 - Exactly.

00:35:30.180 --> 00:35:31.020
 - And just have natural beauty.

00:35:31.020 --> 00:35:31.860
 - Exactly.

00:35:31.860 --> 00:35:34.220
 - And he was like, "No, natural beauty."

00:35:34.220 --> 00:35:37.540
 - Yeah, no, have you seen their natural faces underneath?

00:35:37.540 --> 00:35:39.660
 And that's also a good read.

00:35:39.660 --> 00:35:41.580
 - Lots of slap, dusty bosoms.

00:35:41.580 --> 00:35:44.180
 (all laughing)

00:35:44.180 --> 00:35:49.980
 - He gets quoted a lot as a kind of proto pickup artist.

00:35:49.980 --> 00:35:50.820
 - Yeah.

00:35:50.820 --> 00:35:53.700
 - And there was a brief trend when that sort of--

00:35:53.700 --> 00:35:55.060
 - Neil Strauss, the game.

00:35:55.060 --> 00:35:57.620
 - Sort of grim thing of pickup artistry was doing a thing.

00:35:57.620 --> 00:36:00.500
 A lot of like proto bros were saying,

00:36:00.500 --> 00:36:01.940
 "You can't read Ovid."

00:36:01.940 --> 00:36:03.700
 In much the same way that they were all saying,

00:36:03.700 --> 00:36:06.700
 "You've got to read Sun Tzu's, The Art of War."

00:36:06.700 --> 00:36:07.540
 - Are you reading that?

00:36:07.540 --> 00:36:08.540
 Are you really?

00:36:08.540 --> 00:36:09.860
 - Are you actually reading Marx or really,

00:36:09.860 --> 00:36:11.380
 it says meditations, are you?

00:36:11.380 --> 00:36:12.660
 - It did actually really remind me of that.

00:36:12.660 --> 00:36:14.020
 I didn't realise people are connected to those.

00:36:14.020 --> 00:36:16.220
 It reminded me of that game mentality.

00:36:16.220 --> 00:36:18.660
 But a lot of his advice is quite sort of modern,

00:36:18.660 --> 00:36:23.140
 like when he says how you should befriend the lady's maid.

00:36:23.140 --> 00:36:23.980
 - Yes.

00:36:23.980 --> 00:36:25.700
 - And that's how to get in there.

00:36:25.700 --> 00:36:26.740
 - Yes, very clever.

00:36:26.740 --> 00:36:28.100
 - So it is a bit like that, yeah.

00:36:28.100 --> 00:36:28.940
 I mean, he's--

00:36:28.940 --> 00:36:30.660
 - How would he do that with a friend who's a lady's maid?

00:36:30.660 --> 00:36:32.460
 What kind of life do you need for a gig?

00:36:32.460 --> 00:36:34.140
 (all laughing)

00:36:34.140 --> 00:36:34.980
 - So modern.

00:36:34.980 --> 00:36:35.980
 - That is what you do.

00:36:35.980 --> 00:36:38.260
 (all laughing)

00:36:38.260 --> 00:36:39.620
 - But one of the people who's written loads about this

00:36:39.620 --> 00:36:42.380
 is a woman called Donna Zuckerberg, who is a classicist.

00:36:42.380 --> 00:36:45.140
 And she's written a book called Classics Beyond the Manosphere,

00:36:45.140 --> 00:36:46.180
 all about this.

00:36:46.180 --> 00:36:48.100
 And she is an interesting person.

00:36:48.100 --> 00:36:49.820
 She's the only Zuckerberg sibling

00:36:49.820 --> 00:36:52.300
 not to have become a tech titan.

00:36:52.300 --> 00:36:53.140
 - Wow.

00:36:53.140 --> 00:36:54.620
 - Yeah, she's a sister of Mark

00:36:54.620 --> 00:36:56.300
 and there are four, I think four Zuckerbergs.

00:36:56.300 --> 00:36:57.900
 And yeah.

00:36:57.900 --> 00:37:00.020
 - Well, she, yeah, she wrote a book as well

00:37:00.020 --> 00:37:01.340
 as the one that you were talking about

00:37:01.340 --> 00:37:03.340
 called Not All Dead White Men.

00:37:03.340 --> 00:37:05.340
 And the idea was she was talking about

00:37:05.340 --> 00:37:07.340
 how the sort of alt-right of America

00:37:07.340 --> 00:37:11.220
 have really harnessed all the Roman ideas and so on.

00:37:11.220 --> 00:37:14.780
 And of it is very much connected to the Neil Strauss

00:37:14.780 --> 00:37:17.420
 the game pickup artist movement that's going on.

00:37:17.420 --> 00:37:19.380
 And she wants to keep showing the connection

00:37:19.380 --> 00:37:20.860
 between those two things.

00:37:20.860 --> 00:37:23.900
 And it's so interesting that she is Mark Zuckerberg's sister

00:37:23.900 --> 00:37:26.100
 because the very first thing that he did

00:37:26.100 --> 00:37:27.980
 was a site called FaceMash

00:37:27.980 --> 00:37:30.860
 where you got students who went to Harvard University,

00:37:30.860 --> 00:37:33.580
 both women, their pictures, which he hacked off a system

00:37:33.580 --> 00:37:35.740
 and you ranked who you thought was hotter.

00:37:35.740 --> 00:37:38.220
 That was the original Facebook, basically.

00:37:38.220 --> 00:37:41.060
 And so she must have been horrified by that

00:37:41.060 --> 00:37:44.060
 and decided to dedicate her life

00:37:44.060 --> 00:37:46.820
 to showing what a misogynistic move that was by her brother.

00:37:46.820 --> 00:37:48.220
 - Sounds like they have parted ways.

00:37:48.220 --> 00:37:50.460
 Well, so she's saying Ovid was a misogynist

00:37:50.460 --> 00:37:51.820
 and so these guys sort of see--

00:37:51.820 --> 00:37:53.740
 - She's not necessarily, she's sort of saying that

00:37:53.740 --> 00:37:54.900
 as Andy was saying before,

00:37:54.900 --> 00:37:58.860
 it's that thing of using an old historical idea

00:37:58.860 --> 00:38:01.020
 to give legitimacy to why you're--

00:38:01.020 --> 00:38:02.900
 - We can't all blame the fact

00:38:02.900 --> 00:38:04.780
 that men keep the threatening my maid.

00:38:04.860 --> 00:38:07.100
 (laughing)

00:38:07.100 --> 00:38:08.100
 - Oh, no, Ovid.

00:38:08.100 --> 00:38:11.220
 - 'Cause a lot of it does obviously read quite sleazy,

00:38:11.220 --> 00:38:12.060
 but a lot of it doesn't.

00:38:12.060 --> 00:38:13.700
 You know, he says, send very eloquent love notes.

00:38:13.700 --> 00:38:15.060
 Cry in front of your loved one.

00:38:15.060 --> 00:38:17.180
 I don't recall seeing Andrew Tate saying,

00:38:17.180 --> 00:38:19.220
 "You've gotta be able to cry in front of her."

00:38:19.220 --> 00:38:21.500
 You know, that's not, it is a bit different.

00:38:21.500 --> 00:38:22.340
 - But what's also different

00:38:22.340 --> 00:38:24.820
 in which Donna Zuckerberg writes about in her book

00:38:24.820 --> 00:38:26.460
 is that it was actually,

00:38:26.460 --> 00:38:28.100
 it was quite a lot more dangerous

00:38:28.100 --> 00:38:29.860
 in the times the advice that he was giving

00:38:29.860 --> 00:38:31.340
 because when he was saying things like,

00:38:31.340 --> 00:38:34.220
 befriend the husband of the person you're fancying,

00:38:34.220 --> 00:38:35.740
 there was death penalties back in the day

00:38:35.740 --> 00:38:38.220
 for things like if you were having a child out of wedlock,

00:38:38.220 --> 00:38:39.700
 if you were, well, it was dangerous.

00:38:39.700 --> 00:38:41.100
 It was, there would be certain things

00:38:41.100 --> 00:38:43.020
 that you weren't allowed to do that in this day and age.

00:38:43.020 --> 00:38:46.660
 You'd get away as sort of just, it's bad manners, but--

00:38:46.660 --> 00:38:48.620
 - Is that how you think the affair's gonna go down then?

00:38:48.620 --> 00:38:49.460
 - Yeah.

00:38:49.460 --> 00:38:50.300
 (laughing)

00:38:50.300 --> 00:38:51.140
 - That's Charlie Berger's.

00:38:51.140 --> 00:38:52.700
 (laughing)

00:38:52.700 --> 00:38:53.980
 - No, but yeah, so she points out

00:38:53.980 --> 00:38:57.740
 that the risk level was much higher back then

00:38:57.740 --> 00:38:59.380
 if you were employing these tactics

00:38:59.380 --> 00:39:01.420
 and they worked on certain women in society.

00:39:01.420 --> 00:39:02.420
 - Yeah. - Yeah.

00:39:02.420 --> 00:39:04.340
 - And he suffered the pay the price

00:39:04.340 --> 00:39:06.300
 'cause he suffered relegatio.

00:39:06.300 --> 00:39:07.140
 - He did.

00:39:07.140 --> 00:39:08.740
 - That was the official term for the exile

00:39:08.740 --> 00:39:09.580
 that he was put through.

00:39:09.580 --> 00:39:11.020
 - And he died out in--

00:39:11.020 --> 00:39:11.860
 - Died out there?

00:39:11.860 --> 00:39:14.100
 Relegatio was the mildest form of exile.

00:39:14.100 --> 00:39:16.340
 - What I want to know is when he died,

00:39:16.340 --> 00:39:17.780
 was he with somebody?

00:39:17.780 --> 00:39:19.240
 Was he, did he find love?

00:39:19.240 --> 00:39:21.940
 Did he die in exile alone?

00:39:21.940 --> 00:39:24.620
 - His last word was when, and sadly--

00:39:24.620 --> 00:39:26.420
 (laughing)

00:39:26.420 --> 00:39:28.660
 We don't know the answer.

00:39:28.660 --> 00:39:30.220
 No, he died very unhappy.

00:39:30.220 --> 00:39:32.980
 The last 10 years, he was writing these trusty-eye letters

00:39:32.980 --> 00:39:35.660
 and it was, his book had been banned from libraries

00:39:35.660 --> 00:39:37.580
 and he said, "Look, it's completely awful out here

00:39:37.580 --> 00:39:39.980
 "in modern day Romania."

00:39:39.980 --> 00:39:42.620
 He said, "You know, the wine freezes in the jars

00:39:42.620 --> 00:39:44.460
 "and the ice is so thick on the black sea,

00:39:44.460 --> 00:39:46.140
 "the dolphins can't even jump through the water."

00:39:46.140 --> 00:39:49.060
 You know, really horrible, poor guy.

00:39:49.060 --> 00:39:52.460
 But he was constantly writing poems to his friends

00:39:52.460 --> 00:39:54.340
 and to the emperor and to his wife,

00:39:54.340 --> 00:39:56.740
 probably in that order, to defend his cause,

00:39:56.740 --> 00:39:58.620
 say, "I'm really sorry about all the licentious stuff.

00:39:58.620 --> 00:40:01.100
 "I can change, and I will change,

00:40:01.100 --> 00:40:04.300
 "and create pity for himself," and it did not work.

00:40:04.300 --> 00:40:05.820
 - That's so sad, it reminds me a bit of,

00:40:05.820 --> 00:40:09.060
 you know how John Dunn used to write lots of sexy poems?

00:40:09.060 --> 00:40:11.780
 And then, in his later life, he did lots of like,

00:40:11.780 --> 00:40:16.940
 "Nuh," all his poems were like, "No, ah, God, God, ah."

00:40:16.940 --> 00:40:18.780
 They were all, that was the kind of vibe.

00:40:18.780 --> 00:40:19.620
 - Right.

00:40:19.620 --> 00:40:20.460
 - I didn't know he'd got more like that.

00:40:20.460 --> 00:40:21.980
 I feel like I've read more of the sexy stuff.

00:40:21.980 --> 00:40:23.740
 - Yeah, as only ones are all sexy,

00:40:23.740 --> 00:40:26.540
 and then the later ones are all more self-hating,

00:40:26.540 --> 00:40:30.620
 "God, forgive me," and I'm like, "Sexy past."

00:40:30.620 --> 00:40:32.180
 - God, we all turn into such balls, don't we?

00:40:32.180 --> 00:40:33.380
 It's like Tolstoy.

00:40:33.380 --> 00:40:36.940
 No one ever stays the fun playboy/playgirl.

00:40:36.940 --> 00:40:38.220
 Yeah, it's very sad.

00:40:38.220 --> 00:40:39.740
 - Bit of a good update on Ovid.

00:40:39.740 --> 00:40:41.580
 I do have a bit of good news about the...

00:40:41.580 --> 00:40:43.740
 - So right with that sentence.

00:40:43.740 --> 00:40:44.580
 - Is this breaking news?

00:40:44.580 --> 00:40:45.460
 Has this just come in?

00:40:45.460 --> 00:40:50.460
 - It's recent because Ovid's exile was eventually revoked

00:40:51.380 --> 00:40:56.380
 in 2017, when Rome's city council,

00:40:56.380 --> 00:40:58.900
 who were not what they once were, I suspect,

00:40:58.900 --> 00:41:01.540
 voted to repair the serious wrong that he had suffered,

00:41:01.540 --> 00:41:04.540
 and say his exile was now officially ended.

00:41:04.540 --> 00:41:07.300
 - Was he like the knight in Indiana Jones 3?

00:41:07.300 --> 00:41:08.640
 Is he loud?

00:41:08.640 --> 00:41:10.180
 - He came back, he came back.

00:41:10.180 --> 00:41:11.420
 - Oh, so bad.

00:41:11.420 --> 00:41:13.580
 - You decided, why is he here?

00:41:13.580 --> 00:41:16.160
 (upbeat music)

00:41:16.160 --> 00:41:20.980
 - Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show,

00:41:20.980 --> 00:41:22.740
 and that is Andy.

00:41:22.740 --> 00:41:24.180
 - My fact is that the largest collection

00:41:24.180 --> 00:41:26.620
 of contemporary South African art in the world

00:41:26.620 --> 00:41:29.180
 is in Nando's.

00:41:29.180 --> 00:41:30.540
 - Which branch?

00:41:30.540 --> 00:41:32.140
 - Every branch.

00:41:32.140 --> 00:41:32.980
 No, no, I'm joking.

00:41:32.980 --> 00:41:35.500
 The Manchester, Salford Key's one.

00:41:35.500 --> 00:41:36.820
 - That's a good one.

00:41:36.820 --> 00:41:37.960
 - Yeah, and it's big.

00:41:37.960 --> 00:41:40.860
 So there was a terrific piece in The Guardian recently

00:41:40.860 --> 00:41:43.820
 about Nando's collection of modern South African art.

00:41:43.820 --> 00:41:45.260
 Nando's is a chicken restaurant.

00:41:45.260 --> 00:41:47.140
 For anyone who doesn't know,

00:41:47.140 --> 00:41:48.300
 I don't know, we have American listeners.

00:41:48.300 --> 00:41:49.140
 Do you have Nando's?

00:41:49.140 --> 00:41:50.340
 - I don't think they do have Nando's

00:41:50.340 --> 00:41:51.180
 in the United States.

00:41:51.180 --> 00:41:52.020
 - In America, should we have a Nando's everywhere?

00:41:52.020 --> 00:41:53.020
 - Nando's is global, yeah.

00:41:53.020 --> 00:41:53.860
 - Yeah.

00:41:53.860 --> 00:41:57.500
 - But it's the biggest here, I think it's worth explaining.

00:41:57.500 --> 00:41:58.500
 I've only been to one.

00:41:58.500 --> 00:42:00.540
 - Here is the highest ever peri peri penetration

00:42:00.540 --> 00:42:01.820
 on the planet, I think, in this country.

00:42:01.820 --> 00:42:03.660
 You've only ever been to one Nando's.

00:42:03.660 --> 00:42:05.660
 - Would you guys, in fact, yeah.

00:42:05.660 --> 00:42:06.500
 - Oh, on tour?

00:42:06.500 --> 00:42:07.340
 - On tour, was it?

00:42:07.340 --> 00:42:08.180
 Was it the one at Salford?

00:42:08.180 --> 00:42:09.340
 - It was the one at Salford, yeah.

00:42:09.340 --> 00:42:11.020
 And I only went for the art.

00:42:11.020 --> 00:42:12.900
 (laughing)

00:42:12.900 --> 00:42:14.220
 - Would you like anything, madam?

00:42:14.220 --> 00:42:17.380
 Just a tour of your 70s pieces, please, yeah.

00:42:17.380 --> 00:42:20.020
 Seriously, you've only been to Nando's once in your life.

00:42:20.020 --> 00:42:21.980
 - Yeah, I don't really like dry chicken.

00:42:21.980 --> 00:42:24.180
 - Well, it is quite dry chicken.

00:42:24.180 --> 00:42:25.020
 - It's dry.

00:42:25.020 --> 00:42:28.300
 - But he says that there are more than 20 countries, Nando's.

00:42:28.300 --> 00:42:29.140
 - Uh-huh.

00:42:29.140 --> 00:42:30.820
 - I think you've got to be more than that, you know.

00:42:30.820 --> 00:42:31.660
 - Yeah.

00:42:31.660 --> 00:42:33.060
 - Actually, it's not that much, isn't it, really,

00:42:33.060 --> 00:42:34.700
 in the grand scheme of countries.

00:42:34.700 --> 00:42:36.020
 - It depends on the countries.

00:42:36.020 --> 00:42:39.460
 - Yeah, if you're only in Tuvalu, Vanuatu.

00:42:39.460 --> 00:42:40.940
 - Yeah, then you're doing something wrong

00:42:40.940 --> 00:42:42.060
 in your marketing, I think.

00:42:42.060 --> 00:42:43.820
 - Yeah, so I don't know if they're in the USA,

00:42:43.820 --> 00:42:46.100
 but yeah, they've got about 1,200 restaurants,

00:42:46.100 --> 00:42:47.580
 and across those restaurants,

00:42:47.580 --> 00:42:50.780
 they own 32,000 odd pieces of art,

00:42:50.780 --> 00:42:53.540
 and they buy another couple of thousand every year.

00:42:53.540 --> 00:42:55.900
 And it's the main, seems to be the main thing,

00:42:55.900 --> 00:42:59.180
 keeping the South African contemporary art market going.

00:42:59.180 --> 00:43:00.020
 - Well, it's really nice.

00:43:00.020 --> 00:43:01.580
 - They re-support artists, yeah.

00:43:01.580 --> 00:43:03.500
 - They have a thing called the Creative Block Programme,

00:43:03.500 --> 00:43:05.860
 where they basically hand out wooden blocks

00:43:05.860 --> 00:43:06.700
 for it to be drawn on.

00:43:06.700 --> 00:43:08.500
 So it's original commissions as well,

00:43:08.500 --> 00:43:10.580
 and they have programs where they look after artists.

00:43:10.580 --> 00:43:12.620
 It's, I don't know, the rest of the business is like--

00:43:12.620 --> 00:43:15.860
 - Sorry, they like send wooden blocks to South Africans

00:43:15.860 --> 00:43:17.780
 and say, "Draw something on this and send it back to us."

00:43:17.780 --> 00:43:19.620
 - Well, two artists who are on the scheme,

00:43:19.620 --> 00:43:22.180
 like they run all these schemes for young artists,

00:43:22.180 --> 00:43:25.980
 and they run a thing where it's an apprenticeship program

00:43:25.980 --> 00:43:27.980
 where they take disadvantaged young people

00:43:27.980 --> 00:43:30.940
 who don't have skills, and they train them up over three years

00:43:30.940 --> 00:43:33.180
 to become mosaicists or ceramicists.

00:43:33.180 --> 00:43:34.020
 - Oh, wow!

00:43:34.020 --> 00:43:34.860
 - It's quite cool, yeah.

00:43:34.860 --> 00:43:36.580
 And then obviously you get skills.

00:43:36.580 --> 00:43:39.380
 So yeah, so Nando's doing something quite good.

00:43:39.380 --> 00:43:41.380
 I don't know many other restaurants that--

00:43:41.380 --> 00:43:42.220
 - No.

00:43:42.220 --> 00:43:43.180
 - Oh, any of the restaurants that do this.

00:43:43.180 --> 00:43:44.380
 Does Pizza Express have a--

00:43:44.380 --> 00:43:46.580
 - Well, we didn't know this about Nando's, you know.

00:43:46.580 --> 00:43:48.300
 Pizza Express might have the largest collection

00:43:48.300 --> 00:43:50.580
 of statues in the world, but we don't know.

00:43:50.580 --> 00:43:52.900
 They also do a mentorship scheme,

00:43:52.900 --> 00:43:55.340
 which is basically for furniture, lighting designers.

00:43:55.340 --> 00:43:56.860
 They have a lot of this stuff.

00:43:56.860 --> 00:43:58.140
 The only one that I can think of

00:43:58.140 --> 00:44:01.020
 that does a similar kind of scheme is Whole Foods.

00:44:01.020 --> 00:44:03.180
 Globally, in every Whole Foods,

00:44:03.180 --> 00:44:06.980
 they hire someone who is the artist in store.

00:44:06.980 --> 00:44:08.340
 So when you go into Whole Foods,

00:44:08.340 --> 00:44:09.540
 you might see a lot of different art.

00:44:09.540 --> 00:44:10.540
 You might see a lot of different,

00:44:10.540 --> 00:44:13.100
 like paper mache sculptures around the mushrooms.

00:44:13.100 --> 00:44:14.180
 They might have a big mushroom.

00:44:14.180 --> 00:44:16.540
 That's one person who's doing it bespoke

00:44:16.540 --> 00:44:18.780
 for the Whole Foods as part of the payroll.

00:44:18.780 --> 00:44:19.620
 - Really? - Yeah.

00:44:19.620 --> 00:44:21.180
 - And they're always sculptures of the food.

00:44:21.180 --> 00:44:22.340
 - No, no, like whatever it is,

00:44:22.340 --> 00:44:23.660
 whatever they decide to do

00:44:23.660 --> 00:44:26.020
 as the resident artist of Whole Foods,

00:44:26.020 --> 00:44:27.060
 they get to do. - Okay, sorry.

00:44:27.060 --> 00:44:28.100
 I thought you meant it was like, you know,

00:44:28.100 --> 00:44:30.780
 in Japan when they show sushi,

00:44:30.780 --> 00:44:32.420
 they have sushi models outside restaurants.

00:44:32.420 --> 00:44:33.260
 It's not like that.

00:44:33.260 --> 00:44:34.100
 You're like in the carrots

00:44:34.100 --> 00:44:34.940
 and you've got caramel. - No, no, no.

00:44:34.940 --> 00:44:36.180
 It'll be signs, it will be posters,

00:44:36.180 --> 00:44:38.500
 whatever they want to do, but that's their job.

00:44:38.500 --> 00:44:39.340
 They're the Whole Foods artist.

00:44:39.340 --> 00:44:40.180
 - That's really cool.

00:44:40.180 --> 00:44:42.220
 - Yeah, I was quite slow on the uptake on that.

00:44:42.220 --> 00:44:45.020
 I was thinking, what are they working behind the counter?

00:44:45.020 --> 00:44:46.700
 It's like, well, let's take an artist

00:44:46.700 --> 00:44:49.340
 and get them giving out fish.

00:44:49.340 --> 00:44:50.900
 - Give them a proper career.

00:44:50.900 --> 00:44:52.060
 - Something that'll earn them some money.

00:44:52.060 --> 00:44:53.940
 - I just want, we're buying this salmon, this broccoli,

00:44:53.940 --> 00:44:56.020
 and I'd like a sketch of me, please,

00:44:56.020 --> 00:44:57.020
 while you ring it up.

00:44:57.020 --> 00:44:58.460
 - Domino's Pizza.

00:44:58.460 --> 00:44:59.380
 - Do they have corporate art?

00:44:59.380 --> 00:45:02.340
 - Well, they have a really close link to Frank Lloyd Wright.

00:45:02.340 --> 00:45:04.980
 Like probably the most famous architects,

00:45:04.980 --> 00:45:06.940
 20th century American architects, one of them.

00:45:06.940 --> 00:45:08.780
 And like, you know, had all these utopian visions

00:45:08.780 --> 00:45:10.540
 of what he wanted to do with his architecture.

00:45:10.540 --> 00:45:12.860
 And the founder of Domino's Pizza,

00:45:12.860 --> 00:45:15.220
 this chap called Thomas Monaghan,

00:45:15.220 --> 00:45:17.220
 and he bloody loved Frank Lloyd Wright,

00:45:17.220 --> 00:45:18.780
 it was in the '60s when he founded him,

00:45:18.780 --> 00:45:21.620
 and he was responsible in the '80s

00:45:21.620 --> 00:45:23.780
 for Frank Lloyd Wright's works,

00:45:23.780 --> 00:45:25.900
 like his furnishings and his decorative art,

00:45:25.900 --> 00:45:27.620
 going up in price, single-handedly,

00:45:27.620 --> 00:45:28.940
 'cause he just spent millions.

00:45:28.940 --> 00:45:30.500
 - Did Frank design the little table

00:45:30.500 --> 00:45:32.900
 that goes inside the pizza box?

00:45:32.900 --> 00:45:34.220
 - I don't understand.

00:45:34.220 --> 00:45:37.100
 So what was Frank doing to the pizzas?

00:45:37.100 --> 00:45:38.900
 - Ah, so...

00:45:38.900 --> 00:45:42.380
 - He was a side job just to fund the architecture.

00:45:42.380 --> 00:45:44.420
 - I don't think Frank gave a shit about pizzas,

00:45:44.420 --> 00:45:46.860
 but I think he was dead by this point.

00:45:46.860 --> 00:45:48.700
 (all laughing)

00:45:48.700 --> 00:45:51.060
 - So this is getting more tenuous by the moment.

00:45:51.060 --> 00:45:53.460
 - No, because the whole of Domino's Pizza

00:45:53.460 --> 00:45:55.620
 is like based around Frank Lloyd Wright architecture.

00:45:55.620 --> 00:46:00.620
 So its center of operations is a place called Domino's Farms,

00:46:00.620 --> 00:46:02.540
 it's World HQ, and the whole building

00:46:02.540 --> 00:46:04.380
 is meant to imitate Frank Lloyd Wright's

00:46:04.380 --> 00:46:06.220
 prairie style buildings.

00:46:06.220 --> 00:46:08.740
 Because the founder of Domino's is so obsessed with him,

00:46:08.740 --> 00:46:10.500
 and there's a whole section in it,

00:46:10.500 --> 00:46:11.980
 which is a gallery and exhibition

00:46:11.980 --> 00:46:14.740
 of Frank Lloyd Wright artworks, which he's bought up.

00:46:14.740 --> 00:46:16.220
 He's spent more on Frank Lloyd Wright artwork

00:46:16.220 --> 00:46:18.260
 than anyone else in the world.

00:46:18.260 --> 00:46:19.620
 - Rosie, do you collect art?

00:46:19.620 --> 00:46:20.940
 Have you got any pieces in your house?

00:46:20.940 --> 00:46:22.940
 - No, not yet.

00:46:22.940 --> 00:46:23.780
 - Okay.

00:46:23.780 --> 00:46:24.620
 - Anyone else?

00:46:24.620 --> 00:46:25.620
 - I might from this Frank man.

00:46:25.620 --> 00:46:27.780
 (all laughing)

00:46:27.780 --> 00:46:30.260
 Again, I don't know if he's still available to buy from.

00:46:30.260 --> 00:46:32.220
 (all laughing)

00:46:32.220 --> 00:46:33.420
 Are you an Ando's fan?

00:46:33.420 --> 00:46:37.780
 So like you, I find the chicken a bit dry.

00:46:38.620 --> 00:46:40.860
 Also, is it free range?

00:46:40.860 --> 00:46:42.980
 I don't know if the chicken's free range, is it?

00:46:42.980 --> 00:46:43.980
 - It's already good.

00:46:43.980 --> 00:46:48.020
 - And like, if I have battery chicken, I get chicken guilt.

00:46:48.020 --> 00:46:53.020
 - Okay, but it is an interesting place in general,

00:46:53.020 --> 00:46:56.860
 because, well, it started in 1987, as did I.

00:46:56.860 --> 00:46:57.700
 - That is interesting.

00:46:57.700 --> 00:46:58.540
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:46:58.540 --> 00:47:00.740
 So, you know, I feel an affinity with them,

00:47:00.740 --> 00:47:02.940
 but there is this big thing of the Nando's black card,

00:47:02.940 --> 00:47:05.300
 and I know I've got three people who've all got one,

00:47:05.300 --> 00:47:09.380
 which means you have free Nando's anytime, any place.

00:47:09.380 --> 00:47:10.340
 - Forever and ever.

00:47:10.340 --> 00:47:12.180
 - Yeah, my buddy Tom Davis had it.

00:47:12.180 --> 00:47:13.020
 Do you know Big Tom?

00:47:13.020 --> 00:47:13.860
 - Yes.

00:47:13.860 --> 00:47:17.460
 - Yeah, Tom and I used to go almost every day

00:47:17.460 --> 00:47:19.620
 with his black card in Kentish town.

00:47:19.620 --> 00:47:21.620
 - You've got to use one of the black cards.

00:47:21.620 --> 00:47:22.460
 - Many times.

00:47:22.460 --> 00:47:23.740
 - And why was he given one?

00:47:23.740 --> 00:47:27.260
 'Cause the person I know who had one was a radio host

00:47:27.260 --> 00:47:30.140
 who was cool at the time.

00:47:30.140 --> 00:47:31.340
 - It's just for being famous.

00:47:31.340 --> 00:47:32.180
 I think they're open for that.

00:47:32.180 --> 00:47:33.340
 - Tom wasn't famous at the time.

00:47:33.340 --> 00:47:34.180
 - How did he get one then?

00:47:34.180 --> 00:47:35.660
 - Tom called up Nando's,

00:47:35.660 --> 00:47:37.140
 and he said, "I'm interested in the black card."

00:47:37.140 --> 00:47:39.900
 And then he got called up to the chicken council,

00:47:39.900 --> 00:47:44.020
 and he had to present his case for why he wanted it.

00:47:44.020 --> 00:47:45.780
 - Who sits on the chicken council?

00:47:45.780 --> 00:47:48.860
 - That's a, we don't know, that's like the library.

00:47:48.860 --> 00:47:49.780
 We don't know what's going on.

00:47:49.780 --> 00:47:52.380
 (all laughing)

00:47:52.380 --> 00:47:55.540
 - Are they in chicken suits?

00:47:55.540 --> 00:47:57.100
 - Well, they wanted chicken suits,

00:47:57.100 --> 00:48:00.100
 but they only had gorilla suits at the time.

00:48:00.100 --> 00:48:02.420
 - Do you know anyone who has the dishume dice?

00:48:02.420 --> 00:48:04.300
 You heard about the dishume dice.

00:48:04.300 --> 00:48:06.860
 So Isha Anakbar has the dishume dice,

00:48:06.860 --> 00:48:11.140
 and what it is, is at the end, you throw the dice,

00:48:11.140 --> 00:48:14.060
 and if it lands, if you get two sixes,

00:48:14.060 --> 00:48:17.500
 then you get to get the whole meal for free.

00:48:17.500 --> 00:48:18.340
 - Really?

00:48:18.340 --> 00:48:19.180
 - No way.

00:48:19.180 --> 00:48:21.140
 And what do you have to do to get the dishume dice?

00:48:21.140 --> 00:48:22.380
 - I don't know.

00:48:22.380 --> 00:48:24.540
 - Yes, 'cause that feels like a relatively low-risk

00:48:24.540 --> 00:48:25.700
 financial investment for them.

00:48:25.700 --> 00:48:27.740
 Send a couple of plastic dice out to some influencers,

00:48:27.740 --> 00:48:29.060
 and they have a one-in-thirty-six chance

00:48:29.060 --> 00:48:29.980
 of getting their meal for free.

00:48:29.980 --> 00:48:34.620
 - I went, and he rolled, and we'd ordered so much food,

00:48:34.620 --> 00:48:36.220
 and he got it, we got it all for free,

00:48:36.220 --> 00:48:37.060
 and they were so...

00:48:37.060 --> 00:48:38.420
 - He got two sixes.

00:48:38.420 --> 00:48:39.500
 - I think they were really upset

00:48:39.500 --> 00:48:42.420
 because they looked like they didn't even know...

00:48:42.420 --> 00:48:43.740
 - Oh my god.

00:48:43.740 --> 00:48:44.780
 I mean, yeah.

00:48:44.780 --> 00:48:45.940
 - 'Cause you can get them weighted.

00:48:45.940 --> 00:48:48.300
 You can get those, but that's what I would do.

00:48:48.300 --> 00:48:49.820
 I would go off and have them weighted

00:48:49.820 --> 00:48:51.380
 so that no matter what, they land on six.

00:48:51.380 --> 00:48:52.380
 - Maybe you can't do that

00:48:52.380 --> 00:48:53.780
 'cause their special dishume dice.

00:48:53.780 --> 00:48:56.340
 - They must be designed to look like this.

00:48:56.340 --> 00:48:57.980
 But if you pay just a few thousand pounds

00:48:57.980 --> 00:49:01.780
 to a dice craster, he'll be able to make you two double six

00:49:01.780 --> 00:49:04.180
 every time, but then that'll go on the spreadsheet

00:49:04.180 --> 00:49:05.380
 at Dishume's queue.

00:49:05.380 --> 00:49:07.300
 - Well, you know that spot, don't tell your mate.

00:49:07.300 --> 00:49:09.980
 I know the world-leading dice.

00:49:09.980 --> 00:49:11.620
 He makes the weighted dices.

00:49:11.620 --> 00:49:13.860
 He does them for people like, "Get out!"

00:49:13.860 --> 00:49:15.700
 - Dan, I thought you were just bullshitting then

00:49:15.700 --> 00:49:17.260
 when you were saying with such authority,

00:49:17.260 --> 00:49:19.420
 you know you can get any dice you like weighted.

00:49:19.420 --> 00:49:21.500
 - I had drinks with him with the world-leading...

00:49:21.500 --> 00:49:22.940
 - You're giving away background secrets.

00:49:22.940 --> 00:49:24.580
 Are you supposed to tell us?

00:49:24.580 --> 00:49:26.900
 - We can redact that in the, yeah.

00:49:26.900 --> 00:49:29.260
 - He's very good friends with my friend

00:49:29.260 --> 00:49:30.340
 who's the Loch Ness Monster Hunter

00:49:30.340 --> 00:49:31.940
 and we had drinks on Loch Ness

00:49:31.940 --> 00:49:33.700
 and he told us all about the dice he showed us.

00:49:33.700 --> 00:49:35.660
 Anyway, that's an incredible fact about Dishume.

00:49:35.660 --> 00:49:36.500
 - Yeah, that's terrific.

00:49:36.500 --> 00:49:38.980
 - That's an incredible fact of yours about Tom

00:49:38.980 --> 00:49:41.980
 because Nando's insist that the only rule is

00:49:41.980 --> 00:49:44.540
 they never give their black card to anyone who asked for it.

00:49:44.540 --> 00:49:45.660
 They say it's just if you're famous.

00:49:45.660 --> 00:49:46.900
 - But how wonderful.

00:49:46.900 --> 00:49:49.540
 Before this, I didn't even know there was a chicken committee.

00:49:49.540 --> 00:49:51.780
 (laughing)

00:49:51.780 --> 00:49:54.500
 So you think, what are the chicken committee

00:49:54.500 --> 00:49:55.500
 doing the rest of the chicken?

00:49:55.500 --> 00:49:56.940
 (laughing)

00:49:56.940 --> 00:49:58.620
 - Yeah, it's wall-to-wall.

00:49:58.620 --> 00:50:00.300
 They're pecking, they're walking.

00:50:00.300 --> 00:50:01.940
 (laughing)

00:50:01.940 --> 00:50:04.180
 - I was looking at some logo stuff.

00:50:04.180 --> 00:50:05.580
 Corporate art logos.

00:50:05.580 --> 00:50:08.500
 Do you guys know/remember?

00:50:08.500 --> 00:50:09.700
 I don't know if any of you are old enough.

00:50:09.700 --> 00:50:11.660
 Rosie, don't know how old you are, you could be 60.

00:50:11.660 --> 00:50:12.500
 - I am 60.

00:50:12.500 --> 00:50:15.500
 - And if so, you might remember the time

00:50:15.500 --> 00:50:18.620
 when the Starbucks logo was naked.

00:50:18.620 --> 00:50:19.460
 - Oh.

00:50:19.460 --> 00:50:20.580
 - So you know she has hair over her breast now,

00:50:20.580 --> 00:50:21.540
 she used to have tits out.

00:50:21.540 --> 00:50:22.380
 - Oh, naked.

00:50:22.380 --> 00:50:23.220
 - Stop it, did she?

00:50:23.220 --> 00:50:25.020
 Are you gonna have to Google this right now?

00:50:25.020 --> 00:50:26.860
 - Yeah, 'cause she's a mermaid, right?

00:50:26.860 --> 00:50:27.700
 - Is she?

00:50:27.700 --> 00:50:28.540
 - Yeah, yeah, she's a mermaid.

00:50:28.540 --> 00:50:29.580
 Although she has two tails,

00:50:29.580 --> 00:50:31.860
 so it's quite an unconventional mermaid.

00:50:31.860 --> 00:50:33.180
 - Oh, look, there she is.

00:50:33.180 --> 00:50:34.820
 - She's actually quite unattractive and frumpy.

00:50:34.820 --> 00:50:36.220
 - She's very unattractive.

00:50:36.220 --> 00:50:37.740
 I don't wanna judge her.

00:50:37.740 --> 00:50:38.580
 - I'll judge her.

00:50:38.580 --> 00:50:40.700
 - This is a 15th century drawing of a siren though,

00:50:40.700 --> 00:50:41.780
 and that was the Starbucks logo.

00:50:41.780 --> 00:50:45.300
 - She looks like you're drunk uncle at a wedding.

00:50:45.300 --> 00:50:46.140
 - Wow.

00:50:46.140 --> 00:50:46.980
 - Yeah.

00:50:46.980 --> 00:50:47.820
 She does look drunk,

00:50:47.820 --> 00:50:48.900
 'cause she looks like she's saying,

00:50:48.900 --> 00:50:50.060
 "I've caught these two fish,"

00:50:50.060 --> 00:50:52.300
 and doesn't realize she's holding her own lower body.

00:50:52.300 --> 00:50:54.740
 - Oh, that's classic, yeah, yeah.

00:50:54.740 --> 00:50:56.820
 - Wow, so for two women who are very positive

00:50:56.820 --> 00:50:59.980
 about Mrs. Gaskell, it's not universal sisterhood.

00:50:59.980 --> 00:51:00.820
 - No, no.

00:51:00.820 --> 00:51:01.660
 - This is not what a feminist looks like.

00:51:01.660 --> 00:51:03.860
 - I don't know, they're both in agreement though.

00:51:03.860 --> 00:51:04.700
 At least it's consistency.

00:51:04.700 --> 00:51:06.540
 - You just gotta go with us.

00:51:06.540 --> 00:51:08.660
 - That's what true femininity looks like.

00:51:08.660 --> 00:51:12.220
 - So that was the Starbucks logo,

00:51:12.220 --> 00:51:13.780
 a weird 15th century--

00:51:13.780 --> 00:51:15.140
 - Why did they change it?

00:51:15.140 --> 00:51:16.380
 That's not it.

00:51:16.380 --> 00:51:17.580
 - Well, it's just an upgrade, isn't it?

00:51:17.580 --> 00:51:19.020
 Yeah, it's a Nordic woodcut.

00:51:19.020 --> 00:51:22.620
 She is, yeah, boobs out and bits of tail in each hand.

00:51:22.620 --> 00:51:24.100
 She looks more like she's holding fish now,

00:51:24.100 --> 00:51:25.660
 'cause you can't see the bottom of her tail.

00:51:25.660 --> 00:51:26.900
 So if you look at the Starbucks logo,

00:51:26.900 --> 00:51:28.580
 it looks like she's just holding two dead fish.

00:51:28.580 --> 00:51:29.420
 - Right.

00:51:29.420 --> 00:51:30.740
 - I don't think they sell anything with fish.

00:51:30.740 --> 00:51:32.540
 - They don't sell anything fish-related.

00:51:32.540 --> 00:51:34.780
 - No, they do, they do the tuna macchiato.

00:51:34.780 --> 00:51:35.620
 That is lovely.

00:51:35.620 --> 00:51:36.980
 (laughing)

00:51:36.980 --> 00:51:38.980
 That's really nice.

00:51:38.980 --> 00:51:40.740
 So it was a controversial

00:51:40.740 --> 00:51:42.460
 because she agreed to the one woodcut,

00:51:42.460 --> 00:51:45.460
 but then they put her on all of the cups and all of the--

00:51:45.460 --> 00:51:46.780
 - Yes.

00:51:46.780 --> 00:51:47.700
 - Yeah, right.

00:51:47.700 --> 00:51:49.620
 - Just to tie together this with the howling,

00:51:49.620 --> 00:51:52.940
 I didn't spot any artworks on display in howling too.

00:51:52.940 --> 00:51:53.900
 - Right.

00:51:53.900 --> 00:51:57.500
 - But it's really hard to use original art in films.

00:51:57.500 --> 00:51:59.420
 There are, like the world of image rights

00:51:59.420 --> 00:52:00.820
 has tightened up a lot lately.

00:52:00.820 --> 00:52:02.940
 You can't just, if you want to show the Mona Lisa

00:52:02.940 --> 00:52:03.940
 or Girl with a Palm Earring or whatever,

00:52:03.940 --> 00:52:05.580
 you can't just stick a print in a frame

00:52:05.580 --> 00:52:07.620
 and pretend in the film.

00:52:07.620 --> 00:52:09.900
 'Cause artistic estates get a bit funny about that

00:52:09.900 --> 00:52:11.660
 and rightful owners and all of this.

00:52:11.660 --> 00:52:14.420
 So lots of times when they make a film

00:52:14.420 --> 00:52:16.380
 which features art, or they want it to include

00:52:16.380 --> 00:52:18.500
 really famous art, they take weeks and weeks

00:52:18.500 --> 00:52:21.740
 making replicas and then the estate of the artist

00:52:21.740 --> 00:52:24.540
 insists that the artwork is destroyed,

00:52:24.540 --> 00:52:27.180
 that the filmmakers record and film

00:52:27.180 --> 00:52:29.180
 the destruction of the artwork

00:52:29.180 --> 00:52:30.460
 and then send them the evidence

00:52:30.460 --> 00:52:32.660
 of the fake artwork being destroyed.

00:52:32.660 --> 00:52:34.020
 - That's so interesting 'cause you would figure--

00:52:34.020 --> 00:52:34.860
 - That's insane.

00:52:34.860 --> 00:52:36.700
 - You'd figure that would go on a memorabilia market

00:52:36.700 --> 00:52:39.540
 as opposed to being passed off as a--

00:52:39.540 --> 00:52:40.700
 - I don't know what they're worried about.

00:52:40.700 --> 00:52:41.980
 It might be passing off, yeah.

00:52:41.980 --> 00:52:44.260
 There was a film about Basquiat in 1996

00:52:44.260 --> 00:52:46.180
 and the estate asked for so much money

00:52:46.180 --> 00:52:47.940
 to use Basquiat images that they said,

00:52:47.940 --> 00:52:49.540
 well, we can't make the film.

00:52:49.540 --> 00:52:51.740
 So instead, they just knocked up a load

00:52:51.740 --> 00:52:55.660
 of Basquiat style artwork.

00:52:55.660 --> 00:52:57.860
 But then they had to have a lawyer look at all of the artworks

00:52:57.860 --> 00:52:59.300
 and say, that's fine, that's fine,

00:52:59.300 --> 00:53:02.100
 that's too close to actual Basquiat, can't use that.

00:53:02.100 --> 00:53:02.940
 - Wow, wow.

00:53:02.940 --> 00:53:04.460
 - So all of that is sort of artist approved, yeah.

00:53:04.460 --> 00:53:06.340
 - Is any film producer ever experimented

00:53:06.340 --> 00:53:07.620
 when they get that initial rejection

00:53:07.620 --> 00:53:09.260
 with saying, okay, well instead,

00:53:09.260 --> 00:53:12.180
 we'll draw a load of badly sketched cock and balls

00:53:12.180 --> 00:53:13.380
 to claim that's Basquiat

00:53:13.380 --> 00:53:15.500
 and see what the estate has to say about that?

00:53:15.500 --> 00:53:16.740
 - I don't know.

00:53:16.740 --> 00:53:18.260
 - I think the house is strong position.

00:53:18.260 --> 00:53:19.420
 - You'd be a great film producer.

00:53:19.420 --> 00:53:20.580
 You'd be like really ballsy.

00:53:20.580 --> 00:53:22.300
 - That doesn't work for the movie.

00:53:22.300 --> 00:53:23.740
 (all laughing)

00:53:23.740 --> 00:53:25.620
 - If it's a da Vinci code, it's a bluff.

00:53:25.620 --> 00:53:28.020
 - Yeah, in the da Vinci code,

00:53:28.020 --> 00:53:30.140
 if the Mona Lisa looked like--

00:53:30.140 --> 00:53:31.420
 - It's like a cock and balls.

00:53:31.420 --> 00:53:32.740
 (all laughing)

00:53:32.740 --> 00:53:34.980
 You've got to hope that they bring first.

00:53:34.980 --> 00:53:35.820
 (all laughing)

00:53:35.820 --> 00:53:37.580
 Otherwise, you're stuck with the wind film.

00:53:37.580 --> 00:53:38.980
 - Who's gonna look more stupid?

00:53:38.980 --> 00:53:40.740
 I don't know, I don't know.

00:53:40.740 --> 00:53:42.620
 (all laughing)

00:53:42.620 --> 00:53:45.200
 (upbeat music)

00:53:47.900 --> 00:53:48.900
 - Okay, that's it.

00:53:48.900 --> 00:53:49.860
 That is all of our facts.

00:53:49.860 --> 00:53:51.380
