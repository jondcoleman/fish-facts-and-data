1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:06,500
 (speaking in foreign language)

3
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:09,080
 (upbeat music)

4
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:16,300
 - Hello and welcome to another episode

5
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:19,860
 of "No Such Thing as a Fish," a weekly podcast,

6
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:23,420
 this week coming to you live from the London Palladium.

7
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:26,420
 (audience cheering)

8
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:29,420
 (audience cheering)

9
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:34,500
 Tonight is also a very special episode for us.

10
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:37,640
 It is our 400th episode of "Gang!"

11
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:40,640
 (audience cheering)

12
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,660
 My name is Dan Shriver, I'm sitting here

13
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:47,700
 with Anna Tyshinski, Andrew Huntamari, and James Harkin.

14
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:49,900
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones

15
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:52,880
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days.

16
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:55,860
 And in a particular order, here we go.

17
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:59,300
 Starting with fact number one, and that is Anna.

18
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:02,860
 - My fact this week is that there's a 300 square miles

19
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:05,980
 section of America where all microwaves

20
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:08,180
 have to be kept in cages.

21
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:10,460
 (audience laughing)

22
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:13,580
 - Are they living microwaves?

23
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:15,100
 They're scary, like teethy.

24
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:17,980
 - Violent, yes, some kryptonite was spilled on them

25
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:21,260
 in the '60s and haven't been able to keep control of them.

26
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:23,500
 No, this is, they're kept in specific cages.

27
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:25,380
 I have misled you there slightly.

28
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:27,400
 They have to be kept in faraday cages,

29
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:29,760
 and that's 'cause it's in the quiet zone.

30
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:31,940
 So this is, the whole quiet zone

31
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:34,540
 is actually about 13,000 square miles.

32
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:36,460
 And across that, radio transmissions

33
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:38,260
 and all electromagnetic transmissions

34
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:40,080
 are really restricted.

35
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:42,940
 And within this little 300 square mile section,

36
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:45,640
 which is right next to this Green Bank Observatory,

37
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:47,460
 which is a few giant telescopes,

38
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:48,460
 which are really, really important

39
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:51,240
 for like seeing things from outer space,

40
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:53,660
 they need to have just no interruption.

41
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:56,180
 And that means no waves of any sort.

42
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:58,640
 And that includes, if you're microwaving a burger

43
00:01:58,640 --> 00:01:59,940
 at two in the morning,

44
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:02,420
 that could convince them there's alien life out there.

45
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:04,420
 So it's gotta go in a faraday cage.

46
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:06,060
 - I've had a few burgers at two in the morning

47
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:08,260
 that would convince me there's alien life out there.

48
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:09,580
 (audience laughing)

49
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:12,060
 It is because of this observatory,

50
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:14,100
 although it also happens to be

51
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:15,980
 where the National Security Agency

52
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:18,140
 has one of its listening stations.

53
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:19,680
 - Oh. - Which also happens

54
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,980
 to be in the same area.

55
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:22,340
 - Wait, so what are they listening to?

56
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:23,300
 Are they listening to?

57
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:25,260
 - Well, they might need a lot of quiet,

58
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:26,420
 so they can basically,

59
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:28,940
 they're listening to any foreign transmissions

60
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:31,620
 that come into the eastern side of the United States.

61
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:32,580
 - Right. - So it helps them

62
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:33,780
 to be a bit quiet as well.

63
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:35,140
 - Interesting. - Wow.

64
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:36,900
 - It's for anyone who wants peace and quiet, really.

65
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:37,740
 - Yeah.

66
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:40,500
 - The NSA, these telescope guys,

67
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,620
 weird conspiracy theorists, quite a lot of them there.

68
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:44,580
 - I know, it's a big mix of people, isn't it?

69
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:45,420
 - Yeah. - Yeah.

70
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:46,340
 - Conspiracy theorists, you've got your people

71
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:48,300
 who believe that they suffer from a disease,

72
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:50,100
 whereby Wi-Fi interferes with them,

73
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:52,500
 and they sometimes have to sleep in boxes

74
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:53,340
 to get away from it.

75
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:55,300
 - They should come to the QI office.

76
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:56,140
 (audience laughs)

77
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:58,460
 - Oh, that was a joke about how shit our Wi-Fi is.

78
00:02:58,460 --> 00:02:59,300
 (audience laughs)

79
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:01,500
 - It was, we had a few of the elves in the audience,

80
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:02,700
 and they would have loved that joke.

81
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:05,500
 - Yeah, also we invited our IT guy tonight.

82
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:06,740
 I know he's really shit.

83
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:08,140
 (audience laughs)

84
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:08,980
 Sorry, buddy.

85
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:10,300
 - It sounds just incredible.

86
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:12,220
 The list of restrictions there are,

87
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:13,300
 all because of this telescope.

88
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:15,220
 So there are various things that aren't allowed.

89
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:17,580
 You know, like lots of stuff about Wi-Fi

90
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:19,200
 is technically banned.

91
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,140
 Petrol-driven vehicles are not allowed

92
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:24,220
 because they have spark plugs.

93
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:26,100
 So if you fire them up, that might do something.

94
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:27,380
 - I thought this was so interesting.

95
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:30,220
 I did not know this, that if you are prone

96
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:31,980
 to sort of wearing tinfoil hats or whatever,

97
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:33,500
 and waves getting into your brain,

98
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:35,260
 petrol cars, terrible.

99
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:36,980
 Diesel cars, fine.

100
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:38,380
 Diesel is just compressed.

101
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:40,260
 I guess I never properly understood the difference.

102
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:41,420
 Just really, really compressed

103
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:42,940
 until it's hot enough to ignite.

104
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:44,980
 Whereas petrol, you know, it needs a spark,

105
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:46,380
 and that's giving off waves,

106
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:47,860
 and that's fucking with your brain.

107
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:50,540
 (audience laughs)

108
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:53,300
 - It's not, I just want to clarify, it's not.

109
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:55,420
 - And the members of the public who live there,

110
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:57,460
 so it's a very small population there.

111
00:03:57,460 --> 00:03:59,740
 It's under 200 people that live there.

112
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:00,780
 - This is just in the tiny inner bit.

113
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:02,900
 - In the tiny inner bit, yeah.

114
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:04,340
 But they take it really seriously

115
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:06,460
 about how they have to make sure

116
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:09,700
 that nothing is messing with this telescope,

117
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:11,980
 to the point where there's almost citizen police officers

118
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:14,380
 that go around driving in their car,

119
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:17,660
 just looking every day for any kind of Wi-Fi signal,

120
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:20,060
 or any, there was a guy called Wesley Sizemore,

121
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:21,820
 and he used to just knock on doors,

122
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:24,980
 and just go and walk in and go unplug your microwave,

123
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:26,620
 turn your Wi-Fi off.

124
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:30,100
 Yeah, he once, amazingly, tracked down the radio frequency

125
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:34,620
 interference of a faulty electric blanket in someone's house.

126
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:35,460
 - Wow.

127
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:36,460
 - And he went into their house,

128
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:38,660
 and he confiscated it off them.

129
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:41,300
 - Just woke up a poor granny at three in the morning,

130
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:43,020
 and she got her awake.

131
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:44,900
 - There's a woman called Dr. Karen O'Neill,

132
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:46,380
 who works at the observatory,

133
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:48,580
 and she says that she has members of her family

134
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:49,820
 who never visit them,

135
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:52,700
 because the lack of Wi-Fi stresses out the teenagers.

136
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:53,980
 (audience laughing)

137
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:56,060
 - Yeah, that's why they're not getting visits.

138
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:57,620
 I'm so sorry, we'd love to,

139
00:04:57,620 --> 00:04:59,780
 but the teenagers have to have their Wi-Fi.

140
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:02,260
 - Now, I think a lot of you are probably thinking like,

141
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:04,820
 okay, you have to put the microwave in a Faraday cage.

142
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:06,300
 The first thing I thought was,

143
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:07,980
 isn't a microwave a Faraday cage?

144
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:08,820
 - Yeah.

145
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:11,140
 - I thought that was kind of the whole point of microwaves,

146
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:14,980
 but what it is, is microwaves do have Faraday cages in them,

147
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:16,220
 but they often leak.

148
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:17,060
 - Yeah.

149
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:19,740
 - Okay, so you can test if you have a leaky microwave,

150
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:21,380
 so I tried this today at home.

151
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:23,220
 I put my phone into the microwave

152
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:25,100
 and got my wife to call me,

153
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:27,220
 and I still got the call.

154
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:28,060
 - What?

155
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:29,420
 - And I tried the one backstage,

156
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:30,460
 we have a microwave backstage,

157
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:31,500
 and I put my phone in there,

158
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:32,580
 and one of the elves called me,

159
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:33,420
 and I didn't get it,

160
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:35,180
 so this one is a proper Faraday cage,

161
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:36,820
 but my one at home is a leaky one.

162
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:40,860
 - So, hang on, doesn't that break the microwave?

163
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:42,140
 - No, it don't turn it on.

164
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:44,980
 (audience laughing)

165
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:46,660
 - Well, just, well, don't.

166
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:50,660
 - We should say, in case anyone else was confused.

167
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:52,340
 - Dinner tonight in the Harkin house.

168
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:54,500
 (audience laughing)

169
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:56,340
 - Cooked apple.

170
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:57,720
 - Oh, very nice.

171
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:00,300
 (audience laughing)

172
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:02,940
 - There's a guy who has a van called Emit,

173
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:05,940
 which is the electromagnetic interference tracking truck,

174
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:07,860
 which is a very forced acronym.

175
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:09,700
 But yeah, that might be who you were talking about,

176
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:10,980
 who drives around like the signals.

177
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:13,140
 It's got 17 antennae on it.

178
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:15,140
 - Yeah, well this might be the new guy,

179
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:16,700
 but there's a new sheriff in town.

180
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:17,540
 (audience laughing)

181
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:19,380
 - Yeah, 'cause yeah, Sizemore is retired,

182
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:20,540
 so there's a new guy who goes,

183
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:21,820
 and you can see photos,

184
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:24,060
 and it is like in the X-Files,

185
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:27,020
 that van that's just full of computers and stuff.

186
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:29,140
 Yeah, it's amazing, and they all think

187
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:30,660
 that it's part of the observatory

188
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:32,760
 that is messing with their lives in various different ways,

189
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:34,860
 so there was a mother who called in

190
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:37,940
 saying that she was getting interference on her TV

191
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:39,020
 because of the telescope,

192
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:41,740
 so it just said N-R-A-O on her TV,

193
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:44,060
 and she was like, "You guys are breaking my TV."

194
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:45,020
 So when someone came round,

195
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:47,860
 it turned out that that acronym N-R-A-O

196
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:50,580
 stood for not rated adults only,

197
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:54,580
 and it was because her son was trying to watch porn.

198
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:56,760
 (audience laughing)

199
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:58,380
 - Oh my God.

200
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:00,380
 - What a weird, people get imprisoned, I wonder.

201
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:02,220
 I mean, I know they don't, you get a small fine,

202
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:03,980
 but it's a strange crime to have done.

203
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:06,220
 - Yeah, it's a $50 fine, isn't it?

204
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:08,180
 But the truth is that due to the fact

205
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:09,700
 that no one has any money anymore,

206
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:11,620
 the police are not spending the time

207
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:14,220
 going around trying to prosecute people for this,

208
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:17,100
 and that means that actually most of the places

209
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:20,460
 in that town now have Wi-Fi and have microwaves

210
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:22,660
 'cause they know that no one's gonna do anything,

211
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:24,660
 and the observatory have kind of gone,

212
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:25,940
 "Well fine, we'll deal with it,

213
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:27,420
 "we'll work out what the background is,

214
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:28,800
 "and we'll kind of deal with that."

215
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,500
 The conspiracy theories who think it's fucking with their heads,

216
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:32,580
 they are not happy.

217
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:34,220
 - Right, of course.

218
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:36,340
 - No, they're the ones who are really upset about it.

219
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:37,860
 - Yeah. - Wow.

220
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:38,700
 - Yeah.

221
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:42,140
 - One ski resort, which they made an exception for,

222
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:45,620
 which seems nice, always nice to let the old wealthy skiers

223
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:48,540
 have a way around the rules that bind everyone else,

224
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:50,460
 but that's Snowshoe Mountain,

225
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:54,460
 and it advertises itself as an oasis of cellular activity

226
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:56,420
 in an otherwise total dead zone,

227
00:07:56,420 --> 00:08:00,420
 and they got one of the, you know,

228
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:03,700
 cell companies to wire it up specifically

229
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:06,660
 so that it wouldn't really radiate any waves,

230
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:09,140
 but that you can still call someone on the slopes and say,

231
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:10,460
 "I've lost." - But that's really,

232
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:11,900
 it's really annoying, 'cause you will have,

233
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:14,660
 I guess, reception at the start of the run,

234
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:16,460
 but you're like, "Yeah, yeah, this run's going really well,

235
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:18,740
 "I'm just skiing down, hello, hello,"

236
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:20,420
 as you get further and further away.

237
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:21,620
 - I don't think it runs out, does it?

238
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:23,180
 They don't just put it on the peaks,

239
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:24,220
 that would be terrifying.

240
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:26,980
 - But I guess also once you get it in the ski resorts,

241
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:28,660
 then everyone's gonna want it, right?

242
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:29,780
 It's a slippery slope.

243
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:30,620
 - Oh my God.

244
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:33,780
 (audience laughing)

245
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:36,660
 - Yeah, so that whole area, you've got the ski slope,

246
00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:40,180
 you've got the neo-Nazi area,

247
00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:42,340
 which is quite a popular area there.

248
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:43,660
 Yeah, yeah, there's a lot of neo-Nazis,

249
00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:45,460
 'cause basically, as we were saying before,

250
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:47,060
 it's kind of like people are going there

251
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:48,980
 for either to get away from technology,

252
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:51,780
 or they're going to a place where they can be a prepper

253
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:53,860
 and effectively get away from all this stuff

254
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:55,460
 and just live in isolation.

255
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:57,300
 So you've got the preppers, you've got the neo-Nazis,

256
00:08:57,300 --> 00:09:00,100
 you've got the slopes. - Sorry, why are the neo-Nazis

257
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:01,420
 being dumped in with the preppers

258
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:02,740
 and the people who are afraid of technology?

259
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:03,980
 I know the people who are afraid of technology

260
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:06,420
 are a bit silly, and the preppers are a bit nuts, but.

261
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:07,260
 - And the ski slope is,

262
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:08,740
 I'm just listing all the different communities.

263
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:10,820
 - Why are the neo-Nazis there?

264
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:12,340
 - Everyone's got to be somewhere.

265
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:15,060
 (audience laughing)

266
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:16,620
 - It's so nice to hear someone sticking up

267
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:18,500
 for the neo-Nazis there, it's really good.

268
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:19,340
 - I will not.

269
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:23,060
 But my favorite one, just very quickly,

270
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:26,300
 is the Gazuntai Institute is there as well,

271
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:28,620
 which was set up by Patch Adams.

272
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:30,260
 Do you remember the brilliant movie, Patch Adams?

273
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:31,100
 - It was Rock Williams.

274
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:32,820
 - Yeah, I've recognized that's a sentence

275
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:34,780
 no one has ever said before, the brilliant movie.

276
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:36,100
 - So was he a real person, Patch Adams?

277
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:38,180
 - He's a real person, and he wanted to set up

278
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:40,460
 a hospital where it would be, you didn't have to pay,

279
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:43,340
 and they used humor instead of medicine.

280
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:45,820
 (audience laughing)

281
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:46,900
 And that's where that is as well.

282
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:48,860
 - And they just read that laughter as the best medicine

283
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:49,700
 and took it literally.

284
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:50,860
 - Yeah, he's a brilliant--

285
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:52,100
 - I have heard of him, actually,

286
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:53,380
 is he the one who goes around

287
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:55,740
 with the world's largest pair of underpants?

288
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:56,580
 - That is him.

289
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:57,420
 - That is him, right?

290
00:09:57,420 --> 00:09:58,260
 - Yes.

291
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:00,180
 - And I think like the president of Costa Rica

292
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:01,260
 and the president of Ecuador

293
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:03,580
 have been in this giant underpants or something.

294
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:04,580
 - Yeah, you know him.

295
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:06,900
 - I know, yeah, I remember him.

296
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:07,940
 - Patch Adams, a legend.

297
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:09,260
 - You've seen the sequels.

298
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:12,060
 I don't think that was even in the film.

299
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:13,620
 - This telescope, just briefly,

300
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:15,940
 the actual Green Bank telescope, it is unbelievable.

301
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:20,140
 Okay, so I don't even really fully grasp this.

302
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:23,500
 It can measure the energy from billions of miles away

303
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:25,380
 equivalent to a single snowflake

304
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:27,460
 falling onto the surface of the earth,

305
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:28,860
 but at any normal distance.

306
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:32,140
 - It must be tough when the ski season's up, yes.

307
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:32,980
 - Oh my God!

308
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:36,740
 - Yeah, the energy that they're looking for

309
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:39,380
 is the energy from extremely distant stars like quasars,

310
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:41,700
 which are very, very bright, but they're a long way away,

311
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:44,500
 and they can pick up, the energy that they give off,

312
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:45,740
 all that gets to us here,

313
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:48,140
 is a billionth of a billionth of a millionth

314
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:51,020
 of one watt per square meter,

315
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:53,220
 which is why this telescope needs to be so enormous,

316
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:56,580
 it's two acres, the dish in capacity, in area,

317
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:58,100
 so that it can pick up those signals.

318
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:00,260
 Tiny things, they say, if you're on Saturn,

319
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:01,260
 if you find yourself on Saturn,

320
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:03,300
 and you put your phone on airplane mode,

321
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:06,060
 they can still detect it from there.

322
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:07,700
 - Wow, even on airplane mode?

323
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:09,740
 - Even in airplane mode, so you can't get away with anything.

324
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:12,460
 - I thought airplane mode was absolutely impregnable.

325
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:13,300
 - I'm afraid not,

326
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:15,020
 I'm afraid that's what the government wants you to believe.

327
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:17,460
 - Oh my God, I have to go!

328
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:20,020
 - How's anyone gonna give you a ring on Saturn?

329
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:20,860
 - Hey.

330
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:26,140
 - I reckon that's the last one of those I can get away with.

331
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:27,340
 - Oh, I don't know.

332
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:30,420
 - All I'm thinking is two, one, and I am.

333
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:32,460
 Challenge accepted.

334
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:34,300
 What a shame that that's such an amazing fact,

335
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:36,060
 but the thing that sticks out for everyone

336
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:38,980
 is airplane mode, you can still find us.

337
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:40,900
 - That's the amazing bit, though.

338
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:43,660
 And the Saturn bit, but largely the airplane mode bit,

339
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:45,740
 'cause you're not supposed to be giving off anything.

340
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:47,940
 And another cool thing about the telescope is that,

341
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:50,260
 so it's made of the huge dish,

342
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:51,820
 which receives all the radio waves,

343
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:54,180
 it's made of loads and loads of little panels,

344
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:56,860
 and it needs to be perfectly smooth.

345
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:58,140
 And actually, over the years,

346
00:11:58,140 --> 00:11:59,580
 just the force of gravity

347
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:02,140
 would very, very slightly deform the panels.

348
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:05,620
 And so every panel has a tiny motor attached to it,

349
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:08,260
 which senses, and as soon as it deforms by, you know,

350
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:11,700
 a micrometer by the width of a couple of human hairs,

351
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:14,100
 the motor senses it and adjusts the panel

352
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:16,100
 to make it smooth again. - That's amazing.

353
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:17,060
 - It's pretty good.

354
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:19,500
 - Another person who had a telescope

355
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:23,300
 that needed a lot of work on it was William Herschel.

356
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:27,900
 He was a guy who discovered Uranus, and he was...

357
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:29,460
 - No, yeah, come on. - No.

358
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:30,780
 (audience laughs)

359
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:31,620
 No, I'm with them.

360
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:32,700
 Say the proper name.

361
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:35,100
 (audience laughs)

362
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:36,300
 - Herschel, is it?

363
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:39,340
 (audience laughs)

364
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:42,860
 So William Herschel, he discovered Uranus, or Uranus,

365
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:46,700
 and he was really obsessed with his telescopes,

366
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:49,820
 so much so that his sister, Caroline,

367
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:53,620
 spent her whole life basically polishing his telescope.

368
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:58,620
 And so now, I would accept Uranus, but come on.

369
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:04,420
 And also, he was so obsessed with searching for the stars,

370
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:08,020
 she had to feed him by putting food directly into his mouth.

371
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:10,020
 - Wow. - 'Cause he was so on it.

372
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:11,420
 And she's an amazing person.

373
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:14,860
 She basically was in Hanover,

374
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:16,380
 and then the French Army came in

375
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:17,980
 and they kind of took over Hanover,

376
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:21,940
 and then so William Herschel left there and came to the UK.

377
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:25,300
 He became an organist, and then she came over

378
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:27,220
 and he started giving her singing lessons,

379
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:30,340
 and then before long, she was a superstar in Bath and Bristol.

380
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:33,100
 She was singing five nights a week, she was massive,

381
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:35,140
 but then when her brother wanted to become,

382
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:38,020
 looking at the stars, she had to give it all up

383
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:39,780
 to just polish his telescope.

384
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:41,660
 - Wow. (audience laughs)

385
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:43,820
 - And but then in the end, he died in the end,

386
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:45,980
 and she took over his job,

387
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:48,020
 and she became famous as a discoverer

388
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:50,020
 of no fewer than eight comets.

389
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:52,100
 And for her 96th birthday,

390
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:54,060
 Honbo presented her with a gold medal

391
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:55,900
 for science from the King of Prussia.

392
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:57,100
 - Wow. - Wow.

393
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:58,380
 - How did the brother die?

394
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:00,780
 Did he die mysteriously as a result of having received

395
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:02,620
 no food for several weeks?

396
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:04,020
 (audience laughs)

397
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:05,740
 - We need to move on to our next fact.

398
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:09,100
 It is time for fact number two, and that is my fact.

399
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:12,780
 My fact this week is that the musician Ray Charles,

400
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:15,340
 who was blind, used to fly to gigs

401
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:18,100
 because he thought it was safer than driving.

402
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:22,460
 However, he also insisted on flying the plane himself.

403
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:24,580
 (audience laughs)

404
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:27,220
 This is an extraordinary claim,

405
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:31,500
 and it's come up countless times from his friends,

406
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,340
 from his biographers.

407
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:36,140
 Supposedly, there was a plane that he used to,

408
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:37,740
 that he owned, and he would charter,

409
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:39,180
 and he would bring all his band on.

410
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:41,100
 He had a few planes in his career,

411
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:42,500
 and he used to have a pilot,

412
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:44,980
 who was a friend of his called Tom McGarrity,

413
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:48,420
 and when the plane had gone up and was at cruising level,

414
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:51,060
 he would get really bored and needed to pass the time.

415
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:54,680
 So there's reports of Ray Charles going into the cockpit,

416
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:56,060
 sitting down at the controls,

417
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:59,100
 and being handed over the controls from the pilot,

418
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:01,540
 and just flying the plane there for hours.

419
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:04,060
 There's even stories that maybe he landed the plane

420
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:05,820
 once or twice himself.

421
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:08,420
 - It's why they invented in-flight entertainment,

422
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:10,060
 I think, isn't it?

423
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:11,300
 - To keep Ray Charles.

424
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:12,700
 - To save pilot's lives.

425
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:14,540
 - Do you believe the stories, my question is that?

426
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:15,380
 - Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

427
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:16,220
 - You believe he landed the plane.

428
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:17,460
 - No, I don't believe he landed it.

429
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:20,660
 I do believe that he might have flown it.

430
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:21,500
 - It's so funny.

431
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:23,840
 - I mean, but I don't know enough about planes to know that,

432
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:26,700
 but there's Bobby Womack, for example,

433
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:28,540
 who didn't know that he would do that,

434
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:30,020
 was just sitting on the plane,

435
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:31,940
 and suddenly Ray Charles runs through the cockpit

436
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:33,420
 and takes over it, and he's going,

437
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:34,580
 "Is everyone cool with this?"

438
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:36,820
 And they are like, "It's an incredible anecdote."

439
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:38,820
 He says, "Oh, Jesus me, oh, dear Lord."

440
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:40,380
 He started praying, Bobby Womack.

441
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:41,780
 He said, "There's a blind man flying the plane.

442
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:42,780
 "This is nonsense."

443
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:44,660
 And the trumpet player of Ray Charles' band

444
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:46,420
 just told him to relax and said,

445
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:48,420
 "You don't need eyes to fly a plane."

446
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:50,300
 Everyone was on a lot of heroin at this point,

447
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:52,060
 obviously, by the way.

448
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:53,060
 - Including Ray Charles.

449
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:54,100
 - Including Ray Charles.

450
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:56,100
 - Yeah, they got there really quick.

451
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:57,380
 - Yeah.

452
00:15:57,380 --> 00:16:00,220
 - What I find is that the closer you get to rail Charles

453
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:02,700
 for these anecdotes, the more it gets to,

454
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:04,780
 less that he was flying or landing the plane,

455
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:06,620
 and more that he knew how to do it,

456
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:08,220
 but he didn't necessarily do it.

457
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:09,060
 - Yes.

458
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:09,900
 - So it's interesting.

459
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:11,420
 - I don't know, if one of those inflatable things

460
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:15,020
 can fly a plane, then I reckon Ray Charles can.

461
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:16,820
 - Are you talking about the movie "Earth Plane"?

462
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:17,660
 - Yeah.

463
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:18,500
 (laughing)

464
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:19,820
 - That documentary.

465
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:21,380
 - That's pretty true to life, yeah.

466
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:23,260
 - Yeah, and I read his autobiography

467
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:24,380
 over the last couple of days.

468
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:26,100
 He doesn't mention it in there,

469
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:29,260
 but again, he does say that he would know how to do it.

470
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:32,300
 If worse came to worst and everyone else on the plane died,

471
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:34,420
 he would be able to land it without killing himself.

472
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:35,540
 That's what his claim was.

473
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:36,700
 - He feels like he's done it.

474
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:37,740
 I mean, what else has he done?

475
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:38,820
 Memorised it in a book.

476
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:40,900
 I don't think anyone would say they knew how to fly a plane

477
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:42,020
 if they'd memorised the text.

478
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:43,620
 - Okay, can I tell you his technique

479
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:45,580
 that he was gonna use then to land it?

480
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:46,420
 - Oh, God.

481
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:47,260
 - Oh, yeah, this is awesome, yeah, yeah.

482
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:50,380
 - So his technique was that he was gonna get all the dials

483
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:53,620
 'cause you need the dials to land, as well as your eyes.

484
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:56,540
 But you need the dials and he was gonna smash all these dials

485
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:58,940
 and he was gonna use his hand to feel

486
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:01,020
 the way that the dials are moving all the time.

487
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:03,220
 - Well, no, no, 'cause there's one specific dial.

488
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:04,860
 I don't know if this is still an airplane,

489
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:07,180
 which is the shape of an airplane.

490
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:08,420
 It's like literally an airplane.

491
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:10,100
 So he was like, I'd smash the glass

492
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:11,740
 and I would hold the airplane

493
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:14,020
 and just feel it as we're going down

494
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:15,660
 because that would tell you about the balance

495
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:17,900
 of the airplane and so on, yeah, so, yeah.

496
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:20,900
 So he would just, he would hold a toy airplane basically

497
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:21,860
 in order to land it.

498
00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:25,820
 But he was someone who, if you were looking at other vehicles,

499
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:28,020
 he was someone who took charge of other vehicles.

500
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:30,580
 So his son said that there was one day

501
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:32,740
 where he was coming home in his Corvette

502
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:34,460
 and the driver got to an intersection

503
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:37,620
 and he suddenly said, get out, I wanna drive it.

504
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:39,940
 And the valley said, I can't let you do that.

505
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:41,220
 And he said, it's my car.

506
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:42,940
 And he went, oh, okay, so he got out.

507
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:44,780
 And so his son said they were sitting at home

508
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:47,220
 and there was this huge crash and they went outside

509
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:50,180
 and the car had totaled into the side of the house.

510
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:51,780
 - In fairness, what happened there

511
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:53,420
 is that he was on the clutch

512
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:55,020
 and he'd accidentally let the clutch go

513
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:57,380
 and it kind of jumped forward into a car that came past him.

514
00:17:57,380 --> 00:17:58,420
 - So it's not even 'cause he's blind,

515
00:17:58,420 --> 00:17:59,740
 he's just a shit driver.

516
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:00,580
 - Yeah.

517
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:01,420
 (laughing)

518
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:04,380
 - He started car adverts in the '90s.

519
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:05,220
 Have you seen that?

520
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:06,060
 - Oh, yeah.

521
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:07,140
 - It's a gorgeous car advert

522
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:10,100
 and it shows him driving on the salt flat.

523
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:11,220
 You tell us Great Salt Lake.

524
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:13,620
 So he's not on a road, there are no other vehicles around,

525
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:15,340
 but he's having a whale of a time driving away.

526
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:16,300
 It's lovely.

527
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:19,140
 And his driver, by the way, guess what his driver's name was?

528
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:20,740
 - I don't know.

529
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:22,180
 - Clarence Driver.

530
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:24,420
 - Oh, that's cool.

531
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:26,620
 - He had a long history of doing this.

532
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:28,820
 So the first time he took control of a car

533
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:30,340
 was when he was about eight

534
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:32,420
 and this was when he was at primary school

535
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:33,620
 and his teachers remembered him

536
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:36,740
 as kind of paid in the ass, I guess.

537
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:37,980
 Kind of rebellious.

538
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:40,100
 And one time at primary school,

539
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:43,300
 he managed to break into one of the teacher's cars

540
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:44,780
 and he went to a deaf and blind school.

541
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:45,620
 It was quite groundbreaking.

542
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:47,460
 It was the only one in Florida

543
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:49,900
 and he was sent there as,

544
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:51,420
 he was about five when he was sent there,

545
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:52,260
 five or six, wasn't he?

546
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:53,100
 Or maybe seven.

547
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:54,260
 - Well, he only went blind then.

548
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:55,860
 He went blind at the edge of about six.

549
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:56,700
 - Yes.

550
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:58,780
 And then his mum just sent him to the school

551
00:18:58,780 --> 00:18:59,820
 and yeah, he went there.

552
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:01,420
 He got control of a teacher's car

553
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:04,220
 and he had one of the deaf kids sit next to him

554
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:05,500
 or sit on the hood of the car, I think,

555
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:08,060
 and bang with either his left or right hand

556
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:10,820
 to tell Ray to go left or right.

557
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:12,900
 - This is a Gene Wilder film

558
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:14,940
 and Richard Pire called See No Evil, Hear No Evil.

559
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:15,780
 It genuinely is.

560
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:17,700
 Yes, that's the plot of the film.

561
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:18,900
 - Do they end up like he ended up

562
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:20,220
 which was crashing into a tree?

563
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:21,900
 - Yeah, I think that happens quite a lot in the film.

564
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:23,140
 It's a pretty...

565
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:25,220
 - He also drove motorbikes from time to time.

566
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:27,540
 Definitely, this is in his autobiography.

567
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:30,660
 So when he was about 14 or 15, he was in Tallahassee

568
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:32,140
 and he would ride his motorbike.

569
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:33,140
 And the way that he did that,

570
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:34,860
 he would be in a big sort of area

571
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:37,900
 with nothing else around in the same way as the advert.

572
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:40,300
 But in Tallahassee, he would ride in this area

573
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:42,260
 and his friend would be alongside him

574
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:44,300
 so he could kind of feel him next to him

575
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:45,980
 while he was motorcycling.

576
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:47,020
 - So cool. - Yeah.

577
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:50,220
 - He was better at music than he was at driving vehicles.

578
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:51,140
 - Oh, he was quite good.

579
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:54,340
 Like, I don't believe that he was in the airplane.

580
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:55,380
 I believe he's in the airplane.

581
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:57,260
 I don't believe he drove the airplane personally.

582
00:19:57,260 --> 00:19:58,100
 - Yeah, yeah.

583
00:19:58,100 --> 00:19:59,540
 - But if you read the biography,

584
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:01,980
 there's loads of stuff where he said at one stage

585
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:04,700
 and the pilot forgot to pull the flaps down on the plane

586
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:06,220
 and they weren't climbing properly

587
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:07,820
 and he could sense the problem.

588
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:10,220
 And he said, "You need to put the flaps down."

589
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:12,820
 The pilot went, "Is he wearing skies or is he Yoda?"

590
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:14,380
 - Yeah. (laughing)

591
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:15,420
 - There was another time

592
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:17,620
 when they were flying at 11,000 feet.

593
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:19,500
 Okay, the traffic controller had told them

594
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:21,160
 they need to fly at 11,000.

595
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:24,180
 And he said, "But I had 13,000 in my head.

596
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:25,500
 So I asked the pilot to check

597
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:28,180
 and sure enough, the controller had made a mistake.

598
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:29,580
 Maybe we would have had enough height

599
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:31,220
 to get over the mountains anyway,

600
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:32,940
 but I ain't want to take chances."

601
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:33,780
 (audience laughing)

602
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:34,620
 - Oh my god.

603
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:35,460
 - You got to play it slightly wrong.

604
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:38,300
 It's 30,000 feet in the air, I have.

605
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:39,340
 (laughing)

606
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:41,340
 - So he was really, really into aeroplane.

607
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:43,020
 Like, he really knew a lot about them

608
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:44,300
 and he was properly into them.

609
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:45,140
 But yeah.

610
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:47,460
 - He really didn't like the idea of trading

611
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:48,980
 on being a blind musician.

612
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:50,220
 This is something I find really interesting.

613
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:53,700
 And he, in fact, it has to do with the instrument he played.

614
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:56,580
 The fact that he was a pianist instead of a guitarist

615
00:20:56,580 --> 00:21:00,140
 was because there were so many blind blues musicians,

616
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:03,220
 particularly who played the guitar.

617
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:04,780
 So there was Blind Lemon Jefferson,

618
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:07,020
 Blind Willie Johnson, Blind Willie McTale,

619
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:08,700
 Blind Blake, no other name.

620
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:10,260
 - This is non-negative determinism, isn't it?

621
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:14,860
 - Blind Kerry Davis, Blind Boy Fuller and Blind Joe Reynolds.

622
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:16,940
 All of them, you know, were guitarists.

623
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:19,020
 And so he said, "I don't want to be associated with that."

624
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:21,020
 He said it was as much an association with blindness

625
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:24,180
 as a cane to walk with the guitar.

626
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:26,860
 - Although he did, he loved the piano from the age of three,

627
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:27,700
 which really makes me think,

628
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:30,420
 "I've missed the boat in finding my life's passion."

629
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:32,740
 If that's when you've got to get it, he was three years old.

630
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:35,020
 And he grew up in extreme poverty.

631
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:36,980
 He really read about his early life.

632
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:40,180
 And he think, "God, I suppose I'll never complain again."

633
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:42,860
 You can imagine, like, a single mother,

634
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:46,340
 dad's runoff, very, very poor, black family.

635
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:49,420
 And he heard someone playing the piano

636
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:51,220
 in the shop down the road.

637
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:53,020
 And he ran through, he was three years old.

638
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:55,180
 He sprinted across, pushed his way through the door,

639
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:57,580
 jumped on his lap, and that was it.

640
00:21:57,580 --> 00:22:00,580
 He started banging away and knew he loved it from then on.

641
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:03,580
 And when he went to school, when he was sent to this school,

642
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:05,780
 they would talk braille, obviously.

643
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:08,220
 And it was so hard to read piano music,

644
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:10,820
 'cause, of course, you can only ever play while sight reading

645
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:12,020
 with your left hand.

646
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:13,900
 So he'd have his right hand fumbling away,

647
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:15,500
 feeling the music while his left hand plays,

648
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:17,980
 and then he'd have to swap, and then he'd have to memorize it.

649
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:20,220
 And he could memorize thousands of pages like that.

650
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:21,540
 - Yeah, he was incredible.

651
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:23,020
 The braille stuff is really interesting,

652
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:24,700
 'cause he was very proud of the fact

653
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:28,100
 that he could get on normally while being blind.

654
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:30,380
 And so everything that he got was in braille.

655
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:32,540
 If a contract was sent to him and it wasn't in braille,

656
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:34,180
 he would refuse to sign it.

657
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:35,740
 - I think that's fair enough.

658
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:37,780
 It feels like someone's trying to do one over on you,

659
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:39,580
 if that's what they're sending you.

660
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:40,620
 - That's a good point.

661
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:45,100
 - No, but he got to see Ray, the movie, with Jamie Foxx,

662
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:47,340
 and they turned the script into braille for him

663
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:49,180
 so that he could read it and sort of fact check it

664
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:50,460
 and so on as it was going on.

665
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:52,580
 - They should have made a 3D film

666
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:53,780
 where he could feel the screen

667
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:55,340
 and they're bulging out of it.

668
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:56,460
 Why don't we have that?

669
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:58,180
 - Why don't we have a, I would.

670
00:22:58,180 --> 00:23:00,740
 Could it be cost-effective?

671
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:01,580
 I don't know.

672
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:02,420
 - I don't know.

673
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:03,940
 - It's not very COVID secure.

674
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:06,220
 Everyone in the cinema, especially,

675
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:07,900
 everyone just groping forward at the screen.

676
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:08,740
 - And if you've got the seat,

677
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:10,420
 that's the top left corner of the screen.

678
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:12,500
 You're not putting any action.

679
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:13,940
 He was really good at chess, wasn't he?

680
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:15,180
 And he had his own chess set

681
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:18,180
 where the black squares were all raised slightly

682
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:19,660
 and all the black pieces were pointy

683
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:21,060
 and all the white pieces were round

684
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:22,420
 so he could feel which was which.

685
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:23,580
 - Yeah. - It was really cool.

686
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:26,500
 - Did you read about him playing Willie Nelson at chess?

687
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:27,340
 - Go on.

688
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:28,540
 - He played Willie Nelson,

689
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:30,260
 another great musician at chess.

690
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:31,660
 He challenged Willie Nelson to a game

691
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:33,980
 back in his hotel room or wherever he was

692
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:36,180
 and obviously Ray Charles was blind

693
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:37,300
 so he kept the lights off.

694
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:38,140
 So...

695
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:39,580
 (audience laughing)

696
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:40,900
 - You gotta save electricity, right?

697
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:41,740
 - To save electricity?

698
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:42,580
 What's the point of lighting it?

699
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:44,820
 So he thrashed Willie Nelson at chess.

700
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:45,660
 (audience laughing)

701
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:48,220
 And Willie Nelson couldn't fucking see what was going on.

702
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:49,580
 That's so good.

703
00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:51,740
 Do you, you had this really weird thing

704
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:53,700
 which I didn't believe for ages

705
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:55,380
 but I've found enough sources

706
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:57,340
 and the guy seems legit.

707
00:23:57,340 --> 00:24:01,380
 During the '90s, he got really bored of giving interviews

708
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:04,060
 but he had to give interviews for promotional purposes.

709
00:24:04,060 --> 00:24:07,860
 So instead, he got a white guy from New Jersey

710
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:10,420
 to be him in all the interviews that he did.

711
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:11,500
 - No way. - Yeah.

712
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:13,740
 So this is a producer and writer guy

713
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:17,220
 who interviewed him, a new Ray Charles inside out.

714
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:19,460
 When they had their interview, Ray was so impressed.

715
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:20,540
 He just thought, this is incredible.

716
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:21,900
 We have to meet up again.

717
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:22,940
 And then there was this interview

718
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:24,740
 that was gonna happen with a guy.

719
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:27,300
 The interviewer came over and Ray called him up.

720
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:30,380
 He calls him his white Ray Charles, this guy.

721
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:31,460
 (audience laughing)

722
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:33,300
 And so he comes over and he says,

723
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:35,540
 I want you to do the interview as me

724
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:36,700
 and give all the answers

725
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:38,220
 'cause I can't be bothered doing it.

726
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:39,500
 So he said, okay, I'll do that.

727
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:41,140
 So he sits there and he starts doing it

728
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:42,460
 and the guy asks a question

729
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:44,420
 and he says, well, Ray would say that.

730
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:45,940
 And Ray said, no, no, no, no.

731
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:48,220
 Don't say Ray would say, say I would say,

732
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:50,060
 you are me in this interview.

733
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:52,740
 And they did this whole interview where he was Ray

734
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:54,460
 and it went so well that Ray said,

735
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:56,340
 we must do that again.

736
00:24:56,340 --> 00:24:58,660
 And for a decade, virtually.

737
00:24:58,660 --> 00:24:59,500
 - But not on television.

738
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:00,340
 - Not on television.

739
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:01,700
 This were all print interviews

740
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:04,020
 and people if they were calling up over the phone,

741
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:05,260
 he would do the interview.

742
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:07,140
 Has read this white guy from New Jersey.

743
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:07,980
 - That's amazing.

744
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:09,180
 - Yeah, that's so funny.

745
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:11,300
 And after Ray died, there was even a book,

746
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:13,820
 a photography that was taken by a personal friend

747
00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:16,460
 who said to him, Ray can't write this book now.

748
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:18,100
 Would you mind writing it as him?

749
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:20,020
 He posed his death.

750
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:21,540
 He said, no, but yeah.

751
00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:23,460
 - Is this where, did they have a fight at one point?

752
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:24,540
 Ray's saying, what's all this shit

753
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:25,940
 about me driving a plane?

754
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:27,420
 I'm glad you're stupid.

755
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:33,500
 - He did one really fun thing when he was a kid.

756
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:37,560
 He, like I say, he was like a bit of a lovable troublemaker

757
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:38,820
 is the impression that I got.

758
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:41,260
 And he used to love playing piano at school

759
00:25:41,260 --> 00:25:43,620
 and there was another kid from,

760
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:45,700
 so the school was segregated

761
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:47,180
 and there were a bunch of white kids

762
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:48,420
 who got a better education

763
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:50,580
 and then the black kids basically like got less good,

764
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:52,180
 got less good equipment, all of that.

765
00:25:52,180 --> 00:25:54,100
 And one of the white kids really wanted to come

766
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:56,580
 and play the piano, which was in the black kids'

767
00:25:56,580 --> 00:25:57,660
 part of the school.

768
00:25:57,660 --> 00:25:59,980
 And so this kid came up to Ray and said,

769
00:25:59,980 --> 00:26:01,060
 I need to use a piano.

770
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:02,500
 You need to let me, you need to get off the piano.

771
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:03,460
 I need to use it.

772
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:05,020
 So Ray said, fine, you can have it.

773
00:26:05,020 --> 00:26:06,460
 Just give me 15 minutes.

774
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:08,540
 And this was related by his best friend

775
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:09,980
 at the time who was a guy called Joe.

776
00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:11,420
 And Joe said, I thought that was weird

777
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:13,680
 'cause Ray would never give up without a fight.

778
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:15,500
 And lo and behold, they were in their dorm,

779
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:17,460
 like, you know, half an hour later

780
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:19,540
 and the white kid comes up furious

781
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:21,340
 and Ray spent that 15 minutes

782
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:23,940
 unscrewing every single key on the piano,

783
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:25,220
 putting it in his bag.

784
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:27,940
 And they go, you said you're only one of the piano.

785
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:29,660
 - That's so funny. - That's so funny.

786
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:32,100
 - We've got to move on in a sec to our next fact.

787
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:35,860
 - I just found one other guy who can fly their own aircraft.

788
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:37,020
 - What, what?

789
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:37,980
 - Put an unusual one.

790
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:39,940
 - Yeah, like there's a lot who can fly.

791
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:40,780
 - Oh yeah. - What do you mean?

792
00:26:40,780 --> 00:26:41,620
 - Quite a few.

793
00:26:41,620 --> 00:26:43,460
 - Well, this guy was Pope Benedict the 16th, Dan.

794
00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:45,340
 (laughing)

795
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:47,540
 Is that unusual enough for you?

796
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:48,540
 - Thank you.

797
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:51,180
 - You've got to work on the lead-in to that.

798
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:52,980
 - Now look, this, I mean, James,

799
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:54,420
 if you're skeptical about Ray Charles,

800
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:57,620
 the idea of Benny the 16th flying the papal chopper,

801
00:26:57,620 --> 00:27:00,140
 I've only found it on the website called Catholic News Facts

802
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:01,340
 and it's only there.

803
00:27:01,340 --> 00:27:03,140
 And I feel like they'd have given it more airtime

804
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:04,940
 as the Pope could fly a helicopter.

805
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:05,780
 - How implausible was it?

806
00:27:05,780 --> 00:27:07,420
 Was he one of the sort of 17th century ones?

807
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:09,580
 I always find it hard to keep track of, was it at least?

808
00:27:09,580 --> 00:27:10,700
 - No, he was the last but one.

809
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:11,820
 - Got it.

810
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:12,660
 - The last but one.

811
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:13,500
 - The last one, yeah, yeah, yeah.

812
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:14,420
 - The one who resumed.

813
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:16,060
 - So what's the story?

814
00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:17,060
 Is he-- - He can fly a helicopter,

815
00:27:17,060 --> 00:27:18,060
 that's the story. - Okay, cool.

816
00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:19,980
 (laughing)

817
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:21,140
 - Well, thank God we didn't move on

818
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:22,460
 before you got that story in there.

819
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:25,340
 (laughing)

820
00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:26,260
 - Wow.

821
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:28,740
 - Now it's time for fact number three,

822
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:30,580
 and that is, oh, Andy.

823
00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:32,540
 - My factor is the Pope can fly a helicopter.

824
00:27:32,540 --> 00:27:34,780
 (laughing)

825
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:37,020
 (cheering)

826
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:39,460
 - Thank you.

827
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:41,940
 - Solid gold.

828
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:45,420
 - I know, my fact is there is a zookeeper in America

829
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:48,380
 who cannot change job because the bird he looks after

830
00:27:48,380 --> 00:27:49,660
 is in love with him.

831
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:50,820
 (laughing)

832
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:53,220
 It's, this is such a sweet story.

833
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:54,660
 - I don't think it's very sweet.

834
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:57,420
 - Well, we'll get onto the real details in a minute,

835
00:27:57,420 --> 00:27:59,780
 but the broad brushstrokes are very sweet.

836
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:02,140
 This was sent to me by a guy called Ali Bobson,

837
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:03,340
 so thank you very much, Ali.

838
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:05,740
 It's this brilliant Washington Post investigation.

839
00:28:05,740 --> 00:28:08,620
 There is a crane, a crane to these very tall,

840
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:10,100
 very elegant birds.

841
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:12,540
 And this one is very endangered.

842
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:14,740
 It is a white napped crane,

843
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:16,620
 unbelievably rare and endangered,

844
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:19,140
 and it lives at the Smithsonian Conservation Institute

845
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:19,980
 in Virginia.

846
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:21,140
 There's a breeding center there.

847
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:22,420
 They had this bird.

848
00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:24,620
 It was a female bird needed to be bred with

849
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:27,740
 to preserve the species, but it was a deadly bird.

850
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:31,260
 It allegedly had killed at least two previous partners

851
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:32,300
 rather than mate with them.

852
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:33,980
 It wasn't taking any shit, yeah.

853
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:38,620
 So problem, and they realized maybe it has imprinted

854
00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:40,020
 when it was a young chick,

855
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:44,060
 it thought a human was its parent rather than a crane bird.

856
00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:46,900
 So it is programmed to love humans.

857
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:49,780
 And so they got this keeper who is called Mr. Crow.

858
00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:50,620
 Amazing.

859
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:51,580
 (audience laughing)

860
00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:52,820
 Chris Crow.

861
00:28:52,820 --> 00:28:53,780
 - Don't jump.

862
00:28:53,780 --> 00:28:55,100
 - Jump, jump.

863
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:56,780
 (audience laughing)

864
00:28:56,780 --> 00:28:58,300
 Sorry, it just sounds like it.

865
00:28:58,300 --> 00:28:59,260
 - Chris Cross.

866
00:28:59,260 --> 00:29:00,100
 - Chris Cross.

867
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:01,460
 - Don't get it, don't get it.

868
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:03,180
 But they loved it.

869
00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:07,820
 And so they, in Chris Crow and Warner

870
00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:09,340
 are now basically an item.

871
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:12,060
 And they have done a lot of work,

872
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:13,420
 breeding work together.

873
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:14,260
 (audience laughing)

874
00:29:14,260 --> 00:29:16,100
 - And this is where it gets a bit icky, yeah.

875
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:18,100
 - This is where it gets a fraction icky

876
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:20,140
 if you're squeamish, yeah.

877
00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:23,940
 - So he slowly earned the female cranes trust

878
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:28,220
 by sitting with her and touching her and all that stuff.

879
00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:31,060
 And dancing, like dancing with her is the main thing.

880
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:33,260
 Like a lot of the cranes, before they get together,

881
00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:35,660
 they do this kind of head bobbing dance and stuff.

882
00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:37,140
 And he did all that with her as well.

883
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:39,540
 When no one was looking, he said.

884
00:29:39,540 --> 00:29:43,980
 And now, basically, she will let him inseminate her.

885
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:46,060
 'Cause previously, if you had a crane

886
00:29:46,060 --> 00:29:48,100
 and you needed to artificially inseminate them,

887
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:49,700
 you'd probably have to use that aesthetic,

888
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:50,780
 all that kind of stuff.

889
00:29:50,780 --> 00:29:52,260
 She is well up for it.

890
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:53,100
 - Yeah.

891
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:53,940
 (audience laughing)

892
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:55,740
 - And he doesn't, we should clarify,

893
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:57,860
 inseminate her with his own seed.

894
00:29:57,860 --> 00:29:59,220
 (laughing)

895
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:02,660
 And he does remain fully clothed throughout this process.

896
00:30:02,660 --> 00:30:06,500
 He puts a different crane sperm into her cloaca.

897
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:09,260
 Actually, interestingly, the other crane is called Ray.

898
00:30:09,260 --> 00:30:11,100
 - No, really.

899
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:12,300
 - It's a different one, different Ray.

900
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:13,140
 - Different Ray, yeah.

901
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:14,220
 (audience laughing)

902
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:15,820
 - The article you sent around, though, Andy,

903
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:19,340
 it does, like, as James says, it reads a bit bizarre.

904
00:30:19,340 --> 00:30:21,140
 So, like, literally taking the words,

905
00:30:21,140 --> 00:30:24,140
 it says, kneeling behind the bird.

906
00:30:24,140 --> 00:30:25,900
 Oh, don't put that tone of voice on it.

907
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:27,620
 If you don't, wait a minute, like that.

908
00:30:27,620 --> 00:30:29,860
 It'll make anything sound mucky.

909
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:32,620
 Crow rests a hand gently on her back.

910
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:33,460
 (audience laughing)

911
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:36,380
 Then he starts rubbing her thighs.

912
00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:40,100
 Rhythmically, 30 seconds elapsed.

913
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:42,840
 Before Walnut steps away, it's called Walnut, by the way.

914
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:44,980
 (audience laughing)

915
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:46,580
 Walnut steps away from Crow,

916
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:48,740
 fixes a few out-of-place feathers,

917
00:30:48,740 --> 00:30:50,660
 and then stretches out her wings,

918
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:53,020
 asking for another go-around.

919
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:54,180
 (audience laughing)

920
00:30:54,180 --> 00:30:55,500
 - Dan, if this is your audition tape

921
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:58,580
 for my dad wrote a porno, it means a lot of work.

922
00:30:58,580 --> 00:31:00,420
 - And then it says, "Crow then takes the opportunity

923
00:31:00,420 --> 00:31:02,820
 "to inject Walnut with a syringe of crane semen."

924
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:04,700
 (audience laughing)

925
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:06,900
 Like every beautiful relationship.

926
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:09,460
 - But she keeps on wanting to mate with him,

927
00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:10,580
 even though at the moment,

928
00:31:10,580 --> 00:31:13,700
 they don't need any more eggs from her.

929
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:15,700
 But sometimes, he will just keep her happy

930
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:17,300
 by doing the massage.

931
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:19,860
 - And he gives fake eggs, doesn't he?

932
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:20,700
 - Yes.

933
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:22,860
 - 'Cause you can't give a social create eggs,

934
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:24,380
 but they don't need to be inseminated anymore,

935
00:31:24,380 --> 00:31:25,820
 so they'll just sit and rot.

936
00:31:25,820 --> 00:31:26,980
 So they have to chop the eggs out

937
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:28,700
 and put fake eggs underneath her

938
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:30,580
 to convince her that she's doing good jobs at night.

939
00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:31,700
 - But then she gets tired,

940
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:33,620
 she gets tired looking after the fake eggs,

941
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:35,020
 which he has switched out.

942
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:37,460
 So he sometimes has to stand over the eggs

943
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:38,980
 and watch them for her,

944
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:40,820
 even though he knows they're fake,

945
00:31:40,820 --> 00:31:43,100
 so that she can have a break

946
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:45,140
 from looking after these rubber eggs.

947
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:46,540
 - I feel it, it does feel like

948
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:48,380
 he's going himself into a bit of a bind, doesn't it?

949
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:49,940
 - I know, it's so funny.

950
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:51,660
 - Last we heard he was single.

951
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:56,340
 As far as human partners is concerned,

952
00:31:56,340 --> 00:31:57,860
 he said in one interview,

953
00:31:57,860 --> 00:32:00,260
 "Walnut sets the bar pretty high.

954
00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:02,940
 "I'll never find a woman that's so happy to see me

955
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:05,500
 "that she just starts dancing."

956
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:06,940
 - It's so sweet.

957
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:09,340
 - It's like a roller coaster of sweetness

958
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:10,980
 and ickyness, isn't it?

959
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:12,700
 - He has cheated on her though.

960
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:13,700
 - What?

961
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:16,580
 - Yeah, he's inseminated two other cranes.

962
00:32:16,580 --> 00:32:17,860
 - Okay.

963
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:18,860
 - He's got a type.

964
00:32:18,860 --> 00:32:19,860
 I'm not denying that.

965
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:23,020
 - Are they in the same zoo?

966
00:32:23,020 --> 00:32:23,860
 - Yeah.

967
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:24,700
 - Yeah, they are in the same zoo,

968
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:27,020
 but I don't think Walnut knows about so.

969
00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:28,700
 - I hope she doesn't listen to this.

970
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:32,140
 - Yeah, but that would be terrible.

971
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:34,380
 - But no, he's now a kind of love guru

972
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:36,140
 for the cranes in this place.

973
00:32:36,140 --> 00:32:38,020
 - Really, he knows it, yeah.

974
00:32:38,020 --> 00:32:40,220
 - And apparently the way the cranes flirt

975
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:42,380
 most effectively, aside from this dance,

976
00:32:42,380 --> 00:32:44,580
 is by picking up nesting material,

977
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:46,860
 'cause showing that you want to build a home together,

978
00:32:46,860 --> 00:32:48,860
 aw, again, we're back into sweet,

979
00:32:48,860 --> 00:32:50,780
 sort of in a 1950s kind of way.

980
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:53,260
 - Have you ever tried going on a date around John Lewis?

981
00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:56,900
 It's very, it's sexy stuff, yeah.

982
00:32:56,900 --> 00:32:57,820
 - It's much like that,

983
00:32:57,820 --> 00:33:00,620
 except that John Lewis saw the sticks and twigs,

984
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:01,580
 bits of grass.

985
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:03,300
 - Yeah, there are, I mean, this is not the first,

986
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:04,620
 Chris Crowe did not invent this

987
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:06,340
 in case anyone was looking for, you know,

988
00:33:06,340 --> 00:33:09,140
 this is not the first human crane marriage, as it were.

989
00:33:09,140 --> 00:33:13,940
 The real daddy of this,

990
00:33:13,940 --> 00:33:15,260
 I regret saying daddy already.

991
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:18,860
 There's a scientist called George Archibald,

992
00:33:18,860 --> 00:33:21,020
 who is a don of the crane world.

993
00:33:21,020 --> 00:33:23,940
 He founded the International Crane Foundation.

994
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:27,020
 Just to give you an idea, he's pretty big in Crane Town.

995
00:33:27,020 --> 00:33:29,500
 And he, in 1976, there was a bird called Tex,

996
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:32,580
 which again needed to be mated with to preserve the species.

997
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:35,740
 And he moved in next to her for three months,

998
00:33:35,740 --> 00:33:39,500
 as in he put his bed next to her area where she lived,

999
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:42,340
 mimicked her dance moves from five a.m. every morning.

1000
00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:44,260
 - Wow, wow. - Was truly dedicated.

1001
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:45,980
 And they built a nest together.

1002
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:48,740
 And they worked together for, worked together for...

1003
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:50,500
 (laughing)

1004
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:52,780
 - She's my colleague, darling, honestly.

1005
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:55,540
 I just have to be in the office early again.

1006
00:33:55,540 --> 00:33:57,780
 - I think he might have invented the practice

1007
00:33:57,780 --> 00:34:00,380
 of dressing up as a crane,

1008
00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:03,340
 which you now have to do to feed chicks

1009
00:34:03,340 --> 00:34:05,100
 so that this problem doesn't perpetuate itself,

1010
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:07,660
 so that the chicks don't imprint on humans.

1011
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:08,500
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1012
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:10,340
 - Well, you dress your hand up as a crane for the feeding,

1013
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:11,180
 don't you? - Yeah, it's interesting.

1014
00:34:11,180 --> 00:34:12,020
 - You get like a glove puppet.

1015
00:34:12,020 --> 00:34:14,540
 - Like you're in like a full white hood, aren't you?

1016
00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:16,300
 And then you have like the bird's hand.

1017
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:18,380
 You're not like Rod Hull.

1018
00:34:18,380 --> 00:34:21,980
 If he joined the KKK, that's what it would look like.

1019
00:34:21,980 --> 00:34:23,460
 - He moved to that little community

1020
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:25,500
 in Green Valley, the observatory.

1021
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:28,100
 And you can never say a word.

1022
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:31,180
 You can't speak words to them when you're in the robe.

1023
00:34:31,180 --> 00:34:32,740
 You have to make crane noises, obviously.

1024
00:34:32,740 --> 00:34:35,300
 - How do they, do you know how they sound?

1025
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:36,580
 Just out of curiosity.

1026
00:34:36,580 --> 00:34:37,400
 - I don't know.

1027
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:39,660
 (laughing)

1028
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:40,500
 - No.

1029
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:41,660
 - 'Cause they're like, I didn't realize

1030
00:34:41,660 --> 00:34:45,180
 I didn't know cranes that well up until this fact.

1031
00:34:45,180 --> 00:34:46,340
 They're massive.

1032
00:34:46,340 --> 00:34:47,380
 - Yeah, they're huge, they're huge.

1033
00:34:47,380 --> 00:34:49,900
 - They can be up to six foot, six tall.

1034
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:51,900
 Like that's a big ass bird, right?

1035
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:53,220
 - Yeah.

1036
00:34:53,220 --> 00:34:54,820
 - They're the biggest, biggest flying ones,

1037
00:34:54,820 --> 00:34:56,780
 tallest flying ones, aren't they?

1038
00:34:56,780 --> 00:34:57,660
 Obviously you've got the shit ones

1039
00:34:57,660 --> 00:34:59,340
 like the ostrich that don't count anymore.

1040
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:00,940
 (laughing)

1041
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:02,940
 - Yeah, that's right, they fly so high.

1042
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:03,780
 - Yeah.

1043
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:05,260
 - They can get like 30,000 feet in the air.

1044
00:35:05,260 --> 00:35:06,620
 - Well, they're very tall, yeah.

1045
00:35:06,620 --> 00:35:07,900
 (laughing)

1046
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:09,060
 - Their legs are still on the ground

1047
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:09,900
 for a lot of that time.

1048
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:11,460
 - That's true.

1049
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:12,500
 That's amazing, isn't it?

1050
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:14,420
 And there's a lot of mythology around them

1051
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:16,140
 because they can fly so high

1052
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:18,940
 that they disappear from your actual eyesight.

1053
00:35:18,940 --> 00:35:19,780
 You can't see them.

1054
00:35:19,780 --> 00:35:22,020
 But their voices still at that height

1055
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:24,020
 are so booming that you can hear them.

1056
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:26,380
 So it's a sort of like, oh, there's a crane in the air.

1057
00:35:26,380 --> 00:35:27,700
 - They make a lot of noise, don't they?

1058
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:30,460
 Their track here is as long as they are.

1059
00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:32,740
 But it kind of winds around a little bit,

1060
00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:34,060
 but they make this huge booming.

1061
00:35:34,060 --> 00:35:35,340
 Not like, and he's, "Wah!"

1062
00:35:35,340 --> 00:35:36,180
 - Yeah.

1063
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:37,020
 - It's more like, "Wah!"

1064
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:38,340
 (laughing)

1065
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:40,540
 - Neither of you is successfully seducing a crane,

1066
00:35:40,540 --> 00:35:42,100
 is my judgment.

1067
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:42,940
 - We'll get lettuce.

1068
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:45,060
 - Yeah, so they need to fly high to migrate.

1069
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:46,500
 They're big old migrators.

1070
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:48,860
 And there's an issue now,

1071
00:35:48,860 --> 00:35:51,660
 'cause a lot of them are very endangered, like you said.

1072
00:35:51,660 --> 00:35:54,500
 And I think certain cranes at the Hooper Cranes

1073
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:57,860
 were down to almost single figures in about the 1940s.

1074
00:35:57,860 --> 00:35:59,340
 But their populations have gone up.

1075
00:35:59,340 --> 00:36:02,420
 It's been like quite a success story of conservation.

1076
00:36:02,420 --> 00:36:05,420
 But the way they've gone up is by humans raising them.

1077
00:36:05,420 --> 00:36:06,700
 And this has a slight problem

1078
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:08,300
 where if their parents aren't raising them,

1079
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:10,820
 they're not really evolving to know their migration routes.

1080
00:36:10,820 --> 00:36:12,820
 So there's been a couple of people

1081
00:36:12,820 --> 00:36:15,060
 who have had to migrate with them.

1082
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:16,220
 And they do this by,

1083
00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:18,460
 I don't know if anyone's seen the film, Fly Away Home.

1084
00:36:18,460 --> 00:36:20,420
 But it's basically that.

1085
00:36:20,420 --> 00:36:22,900
 So you get a microlight for anyone who hasn't,

1086
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:24,580
 like a little light aircraft.

1087
00:36:24,580 --> 00:36:26,740
 And you still have to be dressed up as a crane.

1088
00:36:26,740 --> 00:36:28,980
 So I don't know what the crane fucking thinks now.

1089
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:31,220
 - I think the Pope did this once, didn't he?

1090
00:36:31,220 --> 00:36:33,780
 (audience laughing)

1091
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:35,860
 So do you have to stay in costume when you're flying?

1092
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:37,380
 - Yes, so now the cranes all think

1093
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:40,660
 that their leading crane knows how to fly a microlight.

1094
00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:44,300
 And the first person who did this was a guy called Kent Clegg,

1095
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:48,820
 who was like Nick Clegg's very much cooler older brother,

1096
00:36:48,820 --> 00:36:50,900
 biologist and a craneer in the '90s.

1097
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:54,500
 And yeah, he flew with them, it's an 850 mile journey.

1098
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:58,700
 And he flew with them down from basically Idaho,

1099
00:36:58,700 --> 00:37:01,540
 which is on the Canadian border basically, to New Mexico.

1100
00:37:01,540 --> 00:37:04,340
 And others have been doing it still, but...

1101
00:37:04,340 --> 00:37:06,620
 - I think in 2015, the US decided

1102
00:37:06,620 --> 00:37:08,780
 that they were gonna try and stop doing it

1103
00:37:08,780 --> 00:37:10,700
 because of the problem of,

1104
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:14,180
 that the cranes learn better from other cranes basically.

1105
00:37:14,180 --> 00:37:16,260
 So now that there's quite a lot more of them,

1106
00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:18,780
 they're in the hundreds now, they're thinking let's phase it out.

1107
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:21,140
 - Yeah, well, they basically weren't mating.

1108
00:37:21,140 --> 00:37:23,900
 The whole point of migrating is to go up and mate.

1109
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:27,420
 So you fly to have kids up in Canada or whatever,

1110
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:28,620
 and so they flew them there,

1111
00:37:28,620 --> 00:37:32,420
 but then the humans didn't know how to show them how to mate.

1112
00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:33,740
 - Send for crew!

1113
00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:36,380
 (audience laughing)

1114
00:37:36,380 --> 00:37:37,940
 - Just awkwardly making conversation

1115
00:37:37,940 --> 00:37:41,300
 with each other for three months and then going home.

1116
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:42,980
 - There's a really prosaic example of that,

1117
00:37:42,980 --> 00:37:45,100
 teaching the cranes what goes on.

1118
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:47,740
 It's like you're raising them as a person in a costume

1119
00:37:47,740 --> 00:37:50,380
 with a glove puppet, a weird glove puppet on your arm,

1120
00:37:50,380 --> 00:37:51,380
 and you're not allowed to speak,

1121
00:37:51,380 --> 00:37:53,820
 but also they are taught to be afraid of foxes

1122
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:55,340
 because that's not instinctive to them.

1123
00:37:55,340 --> 00:37:56,300
 So they have to be taught.

1124
00:37:56,300 --> 00:37:59,660
 And the way you teach them is to dress up dogs as foxes

1125
00:37:59,660 --> 00:38:01,100
 and get them to harass them.

1126
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:01,940
 - Oh really? - Yeah.

1127
00:38:01,940 --> 00:38:04,820
 - This is so the humans are dressed as cranes.

1128
00:38:04,820 --> 00:38:05,660
 (audience laughing)

1129
00:38:05,660 --> 00:38:06,500
 Who's dressed as a fox?

1130
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:08,060
 The dogs are dressed as foxes. - The dogs are dressed as foxes.

1131
00:38:08,060 --> 00:38:10,700
 - The cranes are dressed, who's the cranes dressed as?

1132
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:12,100
 They're all dressed as the Pope.

1133
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:14,140
 (audience laughing)

1134
00:38:14,140 --> 00:38:16,820
 - Is the weirdest nativity ever, isn't it?

1135
00:38:16,820 --> 00:38:17,660
 - They're amazing.

1136
00:38:17,660 --> 00:38:18,780
 But they're back in the UK.

1137
00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:20,460
 This is a huge victory for conservation.

1138
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:24,300
 They are the first crane egg laid in Britain

1139
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:27,940
 since about the year 1600 was in 2013.

1140
00:38:27,940 --> 00:38:31,220
 And it was given a 24 hour guard 'cause it was so precious.

1141
00:38:31,220 --> 00:38:34,100
 And now the numbers are rising in the UK

1142
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:35,980
 and it's a huge success story, so it's really good.

1143
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:36,820
 - Yes, great.

1144
00:38:36,820 --> 00:38:38,740
 - They've done a fabulous job on it.

1145
00:38:38,740 --> 00:38:40,700
 - Yeah, amazing. - It's a hooray for Chris Crow.

1146
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:43,460
 (audience cheering)

1147
00:38:43,460 --> 00:38:46,100
 - Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show

1148
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:47,700
 and that is James.

1149
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:50,460
 - Okay, my fact this week is that Bill Gates

1150
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:55,300
 is responsible for putting chips in up to 80% of Americans.

1151
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:56,980
 (audience laughing)

1152
00:38:56,980 --> 00:38:57,820
 - You're right.

1153
00:38:57,820 --> 00:38:59,900
 Get to that quiet zone in America, James,

1154
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:00,860
 where you belong.

1155
00:39:00,860 --> 00:39:02,860
 - What websites have you been on, James?

1156
00:39:02,860 --> 00:39:05,620
 - Well, I learned this fact from an anonymous video

1157
00:39:05,620 --> 00:39:06,980
 posted on Facebook.

1158
00:39:06,980 --> 00:39:09,100
 (audience laughing)

1159
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:09,940
 - No, of course not.

1160
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:12,700
 - That's why I got the Pope helicopter thing.

1161
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:13,860
 - No, of course not.

1162
00:39:13,860 --> 00:39:15,620
 So this is a story from a few years ago

1163
00:39:15,620 --> 00:39:18,100
 that Bill Gates has bought up hundreds and thousands

1164
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:20,500
 of acres of land in America.

1165
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:22,900
 On that land, he grows potatoes.

1166
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:25,220
 He sells those potatoes to McDonald's

1167
00:39:25,220 --> 00:39:26,540
 and they sell chips

1168
00:39:26,540 --> 00:39:28,740
 and Americans put them in their face holes.

1169
00:39:28,740 --> 00:39:33,740
 And so 80% of Americans up to have got chips from Bill Gates.

1170
00:39:33,740 --> 00:39:35,180
 - So good.

1171
00:39:35,180 --> 00:39:38,340
 (audience applauding)

1172
00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:39,180
 - There we go.

1173
00:39:39,180 --> 00:39:40,020
 - Yeah, it's incredible.

1174
00:39:40,020 --> 00:39:41,340
 - And of course he does it in the vaccines.

1175
00:39:41,340 --> 00:39:43,220
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1176
00:39:43,220 --> 00:39:44,060
 - Thank you.

1177
00:39:44,060 --> 00:39:44,900
 - Yeah.

1178
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:45,740
 (audience laughing)

1179
00:39:45,740 --> 00:39:49,740
 But yeah, he's one of the few people in the world

1180
00:39:49,740 --> 00:39:52,980
 who has a McDonald's gold card.

1181
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:54,460
 And I don't know if it's connected to this.

1182
00:39:54,460 --> 00:39:55,300
 - What's that?

1183
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:57,420
 - McDonald's gold card is where you can go

1184
00:39:57,420 --> 00:39:59,220
 to any McDonald's, you hand it in,

1185
00:39:59,220 --> 00:40:00,540
 and no matter what you've ordered,

1186
00:40:00,540 --> 00:40:01,860
 they give it to you for free.

1187
00:40:01,860 --> 00:40:02,780
 - Oh, thank God.

1188
00:40:02,780 --> 00:40:03,980
 'Cause otherwise, how would he be able

1189
00:40:03,980 --> 00:40:05,220
 to afford a Big Mac?

1190
00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:06,900
 (audience laughing)

1191
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:08,660
 - Well, they do that, so we don't have it in the UK.

1192
00:40:08,660 --> 00:40:11,060
 What we have is the Nando's Black Card,

1193
00:40:11,060 --> 00:40:12,540
 which is quite a famous card,

1194
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:14,260
 which I've experienced a couple of times.

1195
00:40:14,260 --> 00:40:16,140
 It's like, I have, yeah.

1196
00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:17,380
 Couple of friends of mine have had it.

1197
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:21,660
 So Tom Davis, who is a King Gary, he once had it.

1198
00:40:21,660 --> 00:40:22,500
 He applied for it.

1199
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:24,260
 He got brought in front of the chicken council.

1200
00:40:24,260 --> 00:40:25,100
 - Stop.

1201
00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:25,940
 - Yeah, no, stop.

1202
00:40:25,940 --> 00:40:27,820
 And he had to, are they dressed as chickens?

1203
00:40:27,820 --> 00:40:30,740
 Or are they, had he had to make his case

1204
00:40:30,740 --> 00:40:31,580
 to the chicken council?

1205
00:40:31,580 --> 00:40:34,100
 - First of all, he stands behind the chicken,

1206
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:35,140
 (audience laughing)

1207
00:40:35,140 --> 00:40:36,780
 caresses the thigh.

1208
00:40:36,780 --> 00:40:40,100
 (audience laughing)

1209
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:41,380
 - And then I had another friend who,

1210
00:40:41,380 --> 00:40:44,340
 and bear in mind, like, Ant and Deck had to share one.

1211
00:40:44,340 --> 00:40:45,860
 That's the story going on.

1212
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:46,700
 - It's so nice.

1213
00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:47,540
 - He's a hell of a rare, the Black Card.

1214
00:40:47,540 --> 00:40:48,380
 - They go everywhere together.

1215
00:40:48,380 --> 00:40:49,220
 What's the point of giving them two?

1216
00:40:49,220 --> 00:40:50,060
 - Yeah, there's no part giving them two.

1217
00:40:50,060 --> 00:40:50,900
 - Yeah, that's true, yeah.

1218
00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:51,860
 - Well, that's what keeps them together,

1219
00:40:51,860 --> 00:40:53,300
 is just the Black Nando's card.

1220
00:40:53,300 --> 00:40:55,300
 They've hated each other 20 years.

1221
00:40:55,300 --> 00:40:58,020
 - But so, he has this gold card,

1222
00:40:58,020 --> 00:41:00,380
 and only quite a few Americans have it,

1223
00:41:00,380 --> 00:41:01,220
 the McDonald's card.

1224
00:41:01,220 --> 00:41:02,460
 - I think it's not related.

1225
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:04,340
 I think that's just because he's really rich.

1226
00:41:04,340 --> 00:41:05,180
 - Fair enough.

1227
00:41:05,180 --> 00:41:06,500
 - Oh. - Fair enough.

1228
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:09,060
 - He gets involved in some funny old games, doesn't he?

1229
00:41:09,060 --> 00:41:11,020
 'Cause since he became the richest man in the world,

1230
00:41:11,020 --> 00:41:12,620
 and then started, he just started investing

1231
00:41:12,620 --> 00:41:14,020
 in lots of things, but also, obviously,

1232
00:41:14,020 --> 00:41:16,540
 huge amounts of, you know, very worthy stuff,

1233
00:41:16,540 --> 00:41:19,500
 and trying to beat malaria and this kind of thing.

1234
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:24,500
 In 2009, he paid $50 million to circumcise 650,000 men.

1235
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:27,020
 (audience laughing)

1236
00:41:27,020 --> 00:41:29,180
 - Okay, you gotta give that some context.

1237
00:41:29,180 --> 00:41:31,180
 Otherwise, it feels like it's not fair on him.

1238
00:41:31,180 --> 00:41:33,780
 - It was a project attempting to curb HIV,

1239
00:41:33,780 --> 00:41:36,220
 because there are studies, some studies that show

1240
00:41:36,220 --> 00:41:38,860
 that circumcision lowers the risk of becoming infected,

1241
00:41:38,860 --> 00:41:39,980
 and he funded the program.

1242
00:41:39,980 --> 00:41:41,620
 - Ah, so he wasn't literally there.

1243
00:41:41,620 --> 00:41:43,340
 - No, he insisted, that's part of it.

1244
00:41:43,340 --> 00:41:44,580
 He said, "I'm gonna give you $50 million,

1245
00:41:44,580 --> 00:41:45,940
 "but I wanna do them all myself."

1246
00:41:45,940 --> 00:41:48,220
 (audience laughing)

1247
00:41:48,220 --> 00:41:49,940
 And he asked to keep them.

1248
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:50,940
 It was weird.

1249
00:41:50,940 --> 00:41:52,500
 Yeah.

1250
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:55,340
 He was, there were a lot of protests against this.

1251
00:41:55,340 --> 00:41:56,180
 - Yeah.

1252
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:58,260
 - I mean, various people saying this is not the way

1253
00:41:58,260 --> 00:42:00,580
 to defeat HIV or AIDS, and also,

1254
00:42:00,580 --> 00:42:04,940
 the Canadian Foreskin Awareness Project got in touch,

1255
00:42:04,940 --> 00:42:06,660
 and they campaigned against him saying,

1256
00:42:06,660 --> 00:42:09,100
 "No one on earth is more detrimental to Foreskin

1257
00:42:09,100 --> 00:42:10,220
 "than Bill Gates."

1258
00:42:10,220 --> 00:42:12,060
 (audience laughing)

1259
00:42:12,060 --> 00:42:14,180
 They called him Foreskin Enemy Number One.

1260
00:42:14,180 --> 00:42:15,020
 (audience laughing)

1261
00:42:15,020 --> 00:42:16,900
 Yeah, it was incredible.

1262
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:19,740
 Their leader is a charismatic man called Glenn Callender.

1263
00:42:19,740 --> 00:42:21,700
 He challenged Bill Gates, right,

1264
00:42:21,700 --> 00:42:23,260
 'cause Bill Gates was paying for this thing.

1265
00:42:23,260 --> 00:42:25,660
 He said, "If you put Bill Gates in a four-by-four

1266
00:42:25,660 --> 00:42:29,660
 "meter room with me and my Foreskin for exactly 44 minutes,

1267
00:42:29,660 --> 00:42:32,380
 "he will emerge convinced that the circumcision is wrong."

1268
00:42:32,380 --> 00:42:34,940
 - I would like to see him put in a room with him,

1269
00:42:34,940 --> 00:42:36,460
 but his Foreskin isn't in that room.

1270
00:42:36,460 --> 00:42:37,300
 (audience laughing)

1271
00:42:37,300 --> 00:42:38,140
 How do you do that?

1272
00:42:38,140 --> 00:42:40,020
 (audience laughing)

1273
00:42:40,020 --> 00:42:42,340
 Have to be through a letterbox or something.

1274
00:42:42,340 --> 00:42:43,180
 - Yeah.

1275
00:42:43,180 --> 00:42:44,020
 - Wow.

1276
00:42:44,020 --> 00:42:44,860
 - Anyway, he's a hero.

1277
00:42:44,860 --> 00:42:45,700
 - Yeah.

1278
00:42:45,700 --> 00:42:46,540
 - Foreskin Awareness Project.

1279
00:42:46,540 --> 00:42:47,380
 - No, you're aware.

1280
00:42:47,380 --> 00:42:48,220
 - Yeah.

1281
00:42:48,220 --> 00:42:49,060
 - Yeah, I am aware.

1282
00:42:49,060 --> 00:42:52,500
 He was asked about the potato farms on Reddit,

1283
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:54,300
 'cause they said, "Is this part of your climate push?"

1284
00:42:54,300 --> 00:42:56,940
 And he was saying, "No, no, it's just part of investment,"

1285
00:42:56,940 --> 00:42:59,060
 'cause he's made so much money outside of Microsoft.

1286
00:42:59,060 --> 00:43:01,580
 Microsoft is obviously a big part of his wealth,

1287
00:43:01,580 --> 00:43:03,660
 but a huge amount really is the other investments,

1288
00:43:03,660 --> 00:43:05,980
 and it's someone else who does the investing for him,

1289
00:43:05,980 --> 00:43:08,860
 so he has what he calls the Gateskeeper,

1290
00:43:08,860 --> 00:43:09,700
 who is someone--

1291
00:43:09,700 --> 00:43:10,540
 - Brilliant.

1292
00:43:10,540 --> 00:43:15,540
 - Yeah, who turned, so there was $5 billion that he had,

1293
00:43:15,540 --> 00:43:18,860
 which turned it to $82 billion in the time

1294
00:43:18,860 --> 00:43:20,140
 that this guy has made investments.

1295
00:43:20,140 --> 00:43:22,180
 So all these different companies and stuff.

1296
00:43:22,180 --> 00:43:24,220
 - Easier, isn't it, when you're starting with $5 billion?

1297
00:43:24,220 --> 00:43:25,060
 Let's face it.

1298
00:43:25,060 --> 00:43:25,900
 (audience laughing)

1299
00:43:25,900 --> 00:43:27,220
 - Yeah, that's true.

1300
00:43:27,220 --> 00:43:29,060
 His farm is 100 Circles Farm,

1301
00:43:29,060 --> 00:43:31,860
 or one of the farms that he has is 100 Circles Farm,

1302
00:43:31,860 --> 00:43:34,300
 I think is the one that supplies McDonald's.

1303
00:43:34,300 --> 00:43:36,300
 And it's really cool in America, we don't have this,

1304
00:43:36,300 --> 00:43:38,260
 but when you look at America from above,

1305
00:43:38,260 --> 00:43:41,900
 from the ISS, in fact, the farms are all circles, aren't they?

1306
00:43:41,900 --> 00:43:45,740
 In that particular, I think it's like a Great Plains area,

1307
00:43:45,740 --> 00:43:47,780
 then it's perfect circles.

1308
00:43:47,780 --> 00:43:49,820
 It looks like giant crop circles,

1309
00:43:49,820 --> 00:43:53,460
 and it's just completely transformed American farming,

1310
00:43:53,460 --> 00:43:54,380
 I think, when it happened.

1311
00:43:54,380 --> 00:43:55,980
 It's basically center pivot irrigation,

1312
00:43:55,980 --> 00:43:58,060
 which is like when you get one of those things

1313
00:43:58,060 --> 00:44:00,660
 in your garden that spins around in a tiny garden,

1314
00:44:00,660 --> 00:44:03,260
 it's like a giant, giant version of that.

1315
00:44:03,260 --> 00:44:05,820
 And yeah, it basically transformed

1316
00:44:05,820 --> 00:44:09,540
 a completely unfertil, useless bit of land into McDonald's.

1317
00:44:09,540 --> 00:44:11,060
 - It is amazing when you fly over it.

1318
00:44:11,060 --> 00:44:13,020
 And they reckon that, okay,

1319
00:44:13,020 --> 00:44:14,380
 that it's not the climate change thing,

1320
00:44:14,380 --> 00:44:16,500
 but he is saying that he's financing them

1321
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:18,940
 to find more productive seeds,

1322
00:44:18,940 --> 00:44:21,220
 and try and improve agriculture

1323
00:44:21,220 --> 00:44:22,940
 to maybe help people to farm in Africa.

1324
00:44:22,940 --> 00:44:24,780
 That's one of his excuses.

1325
00:44:24,780 --> 00:44:25,860
 - Yeah, yeah.

1326
00:44:25,860 --> 00:44:27,060
 Do you know this isn't the first time

1327
00:44:27,060 --> 00:44:28,980
 that he's worked with French fries?

1328
00:44:28,980 --> 00:44:29,820
 - Okay.

1329
00:44:29,820 --> 00:44:33,380
 - In the '90s, he, do you remember Microsoft?

1330
00:44:33,380 --> 00:44:35,580
 Bob, the little system.

1331
00:44:35,580 --> 00:44:36,420
 - Oh, yeah.

1332
00:44:36,420 --> 00:44:38,620
 - Bob was a disaster of a product.

1333
00:44:38,620 --> 00:44:39,940
 It was meant to be something

1334
00:44:39,940 --> 00:44:42,180
 that hand walked you through every single moment,

1335
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:44,060
 and Clippy was invented for it.

1336
00:44:44,060 --> 00:44:46,180
 - Was it like, it was like a room or something,

1337
00:44:46,180 --> 00:44:47,780
 and you clicked on a little bit,

1338
00:44:47,780 --> 00:44:49,460
 and it would take you to the word process,

1339
00:44:49,460 --> 00:44:50,860
 and you click there and it takes you somewhere else.

1340
00:44:50,860 --> 00:44:51,700
 Is that right?

1341
00:44:51,700 --> 00:44:53,340
 - Exactly, and there was a dog called Rover,

1342
00:44:53,340 --> 00:44:55,580
 and there was Comic Sans was created for it.

1343
00:44:55,580 --> 00:44:57,380
 We've mentioned it on the podcast before.

1344
00:44:57,380 --> 00:44:58,980
 - This is actually giving me no impression

1345
00:44:58,980 --> 00:45:01,860
 of exactly what it was, but--

1346
00:45:01,860 --> 00:45:03,180
 - It was just a very easy way

1347
00:45:03,180 --> 00:45:05,980
 to navigate basically Microsoft Windows,

1348
00:45:05,980 --> 00:45:07,980
 and the leaders on that project,

1349
00:45:07,980 --> 00:45:09,060
 on that failed project,

1350
00:45:09,060 --> 00:45:12,380
 was two people called French and Fries.

1351
00:45:12,380 --> 00:45:13,220
 - No.

1352
00:45:13,220 --> 00:45:14,060
 - Oh, yeah.

1353
00:45:14,060 --> 00:45:17,780
 So Melinda French, who then became Melinda Gates,

1354
00:45:17,780 --> 00:45:20,740
 his now ex-wife, and Karen Fries,

1355
00:45:20,740 --> 00:45:22,540
 who was the leader on the project,

1356
00:45:22,540 --> 00:45:24,860
 and yeah, so yeah, it's really cool.

1357
00:45:24,860 --> 00:45:26,980
 - Do we know if that's what inspired him

1358
00:45:26,980 --> 00:45:29,460
 to do the whole McDonald's thing 40 years later?

1359
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:30,740
 - He's not commented, no.

1360
00:45:30,740 --> 00:45:33,060
 You can do, when you've got Gates money,

1361
00:45:33,060 --> 00:45:34,580
 you can do whatever weird shit you like.

1362
00:45:34,580 --> 00:45:37,420
 So in 2016, he offered 100,000 chickens

1363
00:45:37,420 --> 00:45:39,420
 to various countries, including Bolivia,

1364
00:45:39,420 --> 00:45:43,220
 and he got a rare refusal.

1365
00:45:43,220 --> 00:45:45,060
 - Ouch. - Yeah, Bolivia said,

1366
00:45:45,060 --> 00:45:47,820
 we breed 195 million chickens a year.

1367
00:45:47,820 --> 00:45:49,940
 We do not need a share of 100,000 chickens

1368
00:45:49,940 --> 00:45:51,220
 that Bill Gates is providing us.

1369
00:45:51,220 --> 00:45:52,700
 This is incredibly patronizing.

1370
00:45:52,700 --> 00:45:53,700
 - I don't know.

1371
00:45:53,700 --> 00:45:55,940
 That's kind of locking the gift chicken in the mouth,

1372
00:45:55,940 --> 00:45:56,780
 isn't it?

1373
00:45:56,780 --> 00:45:58,820
 - Well, you know, I kind of understand.

1374
00:45:58,820 --> 00:46:01,020
 If you've got that many chickens already, it feels like.

1375
00:46:01,020 --> 00:46:03,620
 - Yeah, okay, I want to have a chicken.

1376
00:46:03,620 --> 00:46:06,420
 Has anyone seen, this is about Microsoft,

1377
00:46:06,420 --> 00:46:08,620
 and it's something that our colleague,

1378
00:46:08,620 --> 00:46:09,820
 Alex, showed me recently,

1379
00:46:09,820 --> 00:46:12,580
 but if you have an hour and you're,

1380
00:46:12,580 --> 00:46:14,260
 so you've never been more bored in your life

1381
00:46:14,260 --> 00:46:16,500
 and you've watched everything else on television,

1382
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:20,020
 it's the Windows 95 instructional video.

1383
00:46:20,020 --> 00:46:21,540
 Have you seen this? It's a sitcom.

1384
00:46:21,540 --> 00:46:23,940
 - Oh, it's a sitcom, really?

1385
00:46:23,940 --> 00:46:26,980
 - But the Microsoft guys wrote it,

1386
00:46:26,980 --> 00:46:28,940
 and it stars at the height,

1387
00:46:28,940 --> 00:46:30,020
 as their fame was just starting,

1388
00:46:30,020 --> 00:46:31,700
 Jennifer Aniston and Matthew Perry.

1389
00:46:31,700 --> 00:46:32,540
 - No.

1390
00:46:32,540 --> 00:46:34,420
 - Basically, as Rachel and Chandler,

1391
00:46:34,420 --> 00:46:37,660
 it's like the most excruciating hour of your life.

1392
00:46:37,660 --> 00:46:40,020
 Well, to be fair, the second half hour

1393
00:46:40,020 --> 00:46:41,540
 is just like instructions for how to use it.

1394
00:46:41,540 --> 00:46:43,700
 The first half hour is a script

1395
00:46:43,700 --> 00:46:46,620
 that really makes your genitals shrivel back up

1396
00:46:46,620 --> 00:46:48,780
 inside yourself as you're watching.

1397
00:46:48,780 --> 00:46:52,500
 It's, I mean, there's some quite sleazy moments.

1398
00:46:52,500 --> 00:46:54,420
 Well, quite a lot of people pervy on Rachel.

1399
00:46:54,420 --> 00:46:56,340
 There's a classic line from Chandler.

1400
00:46:56,340 --> 00:46:57,700
 They're ordering Chinese food,

1401
00:46:57,700 --> 00:46:59,940
 and someone suggests they order Mushu pork.

1402
00:46:59,940 --> 00:47:01,500
 Chandler says, "You know what's interesting

1403
00:47:01,500 --> 00:47:02,900
 "about Mushu pork?

1404
00:47:02,900 --> 00:47:04,660
 "It's only good when it's together."

1405
00:47:04,660 --> 00:47:06,580
 'Cause moo, not good.

1406
00:47:06,580 --> 00:47:08,940
 And shoo, definitely not good.

1407
00:47:08,940 --> 00:47:10,900
 But Mushu, that's good.

1408
00:47:10,900 --> 00:47:12,980
 (laughing)

1409
00:47:12,980 --> 00:47:14,460
 - You made Dan laugh there, or something?

1410
00:47:14,460 --> 00:47:16,340
 (laughing)

1411
00:47:16,340 --> 00:47:17,460
 - I think it's on your level, actually.

1412
00:47:17,460 --> 00:47:18,700
 - You might really like it.

1413
00:47:18,700 --> 00:47:20,020
 - Classic Chandler.

1414
00:47:20,020 --> 00:47:23,260
 (laughing)

1415
00:47:23,260 --> 00:47:24,340
 - It's pretty painful stuff.

1416
00:47:24,340 --> 00:47:25,820
 - Wow, never heard of that.

1417
00:47:25,820 --> 00:47:27,460
 He was in "Frasier" as well.

1418
00:47:27,460 --> 00:47:28,300
 - Was he?

1419
00:47:28,300 --> 00:47:30,500
 - The second bit huge '90s sitcom.

1420
00:47:30,500 --> 00:47:31,860
 He's apparently ruined.

1421
00:47:31,860 --> 00:47:33,060
 (laughing)

1422
00:47:33,060 --> 00:47:34,780
 - What we talked about on the episode was your--

1423
00:47:34,780 --> 00:47:37,180
 - But I don't think we mentioned that on the episode,

1424
00:47:37,180 --> 00:47:38,780
 actually, yeah, and he was like,

1425
00:47:38,780 --> 00:47:40,420
 was he a fan of "Frasier" or something?

1426
00:47:40,420 --> 00:47:43,860
 - He's a fan, and he turns up to do an interview with "Frasier",

1427
00:47:43,860 --> 00:47:46,540
 but then people just call into the "Frasier" crane show

1428
00:47:46,540 --> 00:47:49,460
 asking for technical support with Microsoft products.

1429
00:47:49,460 --> 00:47:50,300
 It's pretty funny, actually.

1430
00:47:50,300 --> 00:47:52,900
 - He did do that once, didn't he, in 1989,

1431
00:47:52,900 --> 00:47:54,500
 when Microsoft, they weren't massive,

1432
00:47:54,500 --> 00:47:56,060
 but they was getting pretty big.

1433
00:47:56,060 --> 00:47:58,740
 And he was quite famous at that time.

1434
00:47:58,740 --> 00:48:01,100
 He walked into a support facility,

1435
00:48:01,100 --> 00:48:03,300
 and he just sat down, put the headphones on,

1436
00:48:03,300 --> 00:48:05,420
 answered a call, "Hi, this is William.

1437
00:48:05,420 --> 00:48:06,900
 "How can I help you?"

1438
00:48:06,900 --> 00:48:09,980
 And sure enough, he managed to fix the problem

1439
00:48:09,980 --> 00:48:11,540
 'cause he's Bill Gates.

1440
00:48:11,540 --> 00:48:14,700
 And this is on a blog on the company's website,

1441
00:48:14,700 --> 00:48:17,220
 so, you know, but apparently he was so good

1442
00:48:17,220 --> 00:48:19,100
 that when the customer called back later,

1443
00:48:19,100 --> 00:48:21,420
 they said, "I'd like to speak to that nice man

1444
00:48:21,420 --> 00:48:24,700
 "called William, who straightened it all out."

1445
00:48:24,700 --> 00:48:26,420
 - Well, why were they calling back?

1446
00:48:26,420 --> 00:48:29,420
 (audience laughing)

1447
00:48:29,420 --> 00:48:33,780
 - That's an excellent question.

1448
00:48:33,780 --> 00:48:35,860
 - He stood out from a really early age,

1449
00:48:35,860 --> 00:48:38,300
 his abilities, coding abilities.

1450
00:48:38,300 --> 00:48:39,900
 Like, he was a super smart guy.

1451
00:48:39,900 --> 00:48:42,220
 People often point out that he didn't get a university degree,

1452
00:48:42,220 --> 00:48:45,260
 so hope for everyone, but he did go to Harvard

1453
00:48:45,260 --> 00:48:48,020
 and was basically too smart to bother finishing

1454
00:48:48,020 --> 00:48:49,820
 'cause he was starting to build his own company.

1455
00:48:49,820 --> 00:48:51,820
 But when he was at school,

1456
00:48:51,820 --> 00:48:53,540
 he went to one of the only schools in the area

1457
00:48:53,540 --> 00:48:55,700
 which had its own computer, one computer.

1458
00:48:55,700 --> 00:48:59,100
 And the teacher spotted he was super good at coding,

1459
00:48:59,100 --> 00:49:01,700
 and so they asked him to write the school's computer program

1460
00:49:01,700 --> 00:49:03,780
 to schedule all the students' classes

1461
00:49:03,780 --> 00:49:05,060
 and put them all in the right classes.

1462
00:49:05,060 --> 00:49:05,900
 - Wow.

1463
00:49:05,900 --> 00:49:08,940
 - And so he modified, this is him age 15 or whatever,

1464
00:49:08,940 --> 00:49:10,380
 maybe a precious thing's to come.

1465
00:49:10,380 --> 00:49:13,620
 He modified the code in order that he was placed in classes

1466
00:49:13,620 --> 00:49:16,280
 with a disproportionate number of interesting girls.

1467
00:49:16,280 --> 00:49:17,580
 (audience laughing)

1468
00:49:17,580 --> 00:49:19,780
 - Feels like interesting's not being used

1469
00:49:19,780 --> 00:49:20,820
 in its traditional sense though.

1470
00:49:20,820 --> 00:49:22,060
 (audience laughing)

1471
00:49:22,060 --> 00:49:22,980
 Wow.

1472
00:49:22,980 --> 00:49:26,500
 Actually, another, the school that just had one computer,

1473
00:49:26,500 --> 00:49:28,140
 another kid once asked,

1474
00:49:28,140 --> 00:49:30,100
 sort of tried to kick him off the computer,

1475
00:49:30,100 --> 00:49:32,220
 and he said, "Okay, you can have it in 15 minutes."

1476
00:49:32,220 --> 00:49:34,820
 (audience laughing)

1477
00:49:34,820 --> 00:49:35,660
 - It's a keys joke, isn't it?

1478
00:49:35,660 --> 00:49:36,820
 - It's a keys joke.

1479
00:49:36,820 --> 00:49:38,060
 - It's good.

1480
00:49:38,060 --> 00:49:40,300
 - You know, Microsoft Minesweeper,

1481
00:49:40,300 --> 00:49:41,940
 any Minesweeper fans in?

1482
00:49:41,940 --> 00:49:42,780
 - Oh yeah.

1483
00:49:42,780 --> 00:49:43,620
 - Any wasted hours?

1484
00:49:43,620 --> 00:49:44,440
 - Yeah.

1485
00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:46,280
 - Minesweeper crew are in.

1486
00:49:46,280 --> 00:49:48,620
 He, it was put on Windows in 1990

1487
00:49:48,620 --> 00:49:50,300
 and everyone at Microsoft was addicted to it.

1488
00:49:50,300 --> 00:49:52,720
 Everyone loved Minesweeper 'cause it's great.

1489
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:55,400
 And he uninstalled it from his computer,

1490
00:49:55,400 --> 00:49:58,260
 but he was so addicted that he would sneak into

1491
00:49:58,260 --> 00:50:00,380
 the vice president's office after work.

1492
00:50:00,380 --> 00:50:01,220
 He was so addicted.

1493
00:50:01,220 --> 00:50:02,340
 He had the company record.

1494
00:50:02,340 --> 00:50:03,300
 He could do the beginner mode,

1495
00:50:03,300 --> 00:50:04,540
 you know, it was a little like 10 by 10.

1496
00:50:04,540 --> 00:50:05,380
 - Oh yeah.

1497
00:50:05,380 --> 00:50:07,140
 - Beginner mode in five seconds.

1498
00:50:07,140 --> 00:50:08,900
 - Can't you just luckily press someone

1499
00:50:08,900 --> 00:50:10,180
 and they all just kind of,

1500
00:50:10,180 --> 00:50:12,220
 just luckily is in the right place.

1501
00:50:12,220 --> 00:50:13,660
 Occasionally you can do that.

1502
00:50:13,660 --> 00:50:14,860
 I think if you get lucky.

1503
00:50:14,860 --> 00:50:15,980
 - Five seconds is pretty good.

1504
00:50:15,980 --> 00:50:16,820
 - Five seconds is amazing.

1505
00:50:16,820 --> 00:50:19,140
 - But the firm's product manager was Bruce Ryan

1506
00:50:19,140 --> 00:50:20,660
 and he wrote a computer script,

1507
00:50:20,660 --> 00:50:22,780
 which could do it in four seconds.

1508
00:50:22,780 --> 00:50:24,340
 And Bill Gates is not a good loser

1509
00:50:24,340 --> 00:50:25,340
 because when that happened,

1510
00:50:25,340 --> 00:50:27,420
 he sent out an email to all the staff saying,

1511
00:50:27,420 --> 00:50:29,340
 "When machines can do things faster than people,

1512
00:50:29,340 --> 00:50:31,300
 "how can we retain our human dignity?"

1513
00:50:31,300 --> 00:50:32,620
 (audience laughing)

1514
00:50:32,620 --> 00:50:35,660
 - Do you know he's only got one scientific paper

1515
00:50:35,660 --> 00:50:38,660
 that is published under his name, Bill Gates.

1516
00:50:38,660 --> 00:50:43,340
 And it's a possible solution to a mathematical problem

1517
00:50:43,340 --> 00:50:45,660
 about flipping pancakes.

1518
00:50:45,660 --> 00:50:46,620
 - Tell us more, Dan.

1519
00:50:46,620 --> 00:50:47,740
 - Well.

1520
00:50:47,740 --> 00:50:49,060
 - 'Cause this is quite complicated.

1521
00:50:49,060 --> 00:50:51,500
 - It's so complicated that I was hoping

1522
00:50:51,500 --> 00:50:53,980
 to just lob it your way and then bring it back.

1523
00:50:53,980 --> 00:50:56,140
 But basically it is a mathematical problem,

1524
00:50:56,140 --> 00:50:59,220
 which is very intense and it involves

1525
00:50:59,220 --> 00:51:00,540
 how can you flip a number of things

1526
00:51:00,540 --> 00:51:01,980
 that are out of order and make them flip.

1527
00:51:01,980 --> 00:51:04,100
 - Yeah, so if you have a big pile of pancakes,

1528
00:51:04,100 --> 00:51:05,740
 they're all different sizes,

1529
00:51:05,740 --> 00:51:08,300
 and you can put your spatula under any one of them

1530
00:51:08,300 --> 00:51:09,940
 and turn them upside down.

1531
00:51:09,940 --> 00:51:12,900
 How many times can you do that so that when you're finished,

1532
00:51:12,900 --> 00:51:14,100
 they start with the biggest one

1533
00:51:14,100 --> 00:51:15,620
 and they end with the smallest one?

1534
00:51:15,620 --> 00:51:16,460
 - Yeah.

1535
00:51:16,460 --> 00:51:18,780
 - Okay. - And why are you doing this?

1536
00:51:18,780 --> 00:51:20,340
 (audience laughing)

1537
00:51:20,340 --> 00:51:22,060
 - I'll send that back over to you, Dan.

1538
00:51:22,060 --> 00:51:22,900
 - Yeah.

1539
00:51:22,900 --> 00:51:23,740
 (audience laughing)

1540
00:51:23,740 --> 00:51:25,060
 - Are they sweet or savory?

1541
00:51:25,060 --> 00:51:26,500
 (audience laughing)

1542
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:28,260
 - Sorry, back to James for that one.

1543
00:51:28,260 --> 00:51:29,100
 (audience laughing)

1544
00:51:29,100 --> 00:51:30,780
 - There is one version that they worked on

1545
00:51:30,780 --> 00:51:33,260
 called the burnt pancake problem,

1546
00:51:33,260 --> 00:51:35,900
 where, again, we don't know if they're savory or sweet,

1547
00:51:35,900 --> 00:51:37,820
 but we know that on one side they're burnt,

1548
00:51:37,820 --> 00:51:39,420
 and apparently that makes a big difference

1549
00:51:39,420 --> 00:51:40,260
 to the problem.

1550
00:51:40,260 --> 00:51:41,260
 - It certainly does make a big difference.

1551
00:51:41,260 --> 00:51:42,180
 (audience laughing)

1552
00:51:42,180 --> 00:51:43,580
 But not only are they the wrong size,

1553
00:51:43,580 --> 00:51:44,860
 they're now burnt on one side.

1554
00:51:44,860 --> 00:51:46,700
 I'm contacting the kitchen.

1555
00:51:46,700 --> 00:51:48,740
 So he did this while he was at Harvard,

1556
00:51:48,740 --> 00:51:50,460
 and the professor, he was one of the names

1557
00:51:50,460 --> 00:51:51,580
 on the paper with a few other,

1558
00:51:51,580 --> 00:51:53,220
 and it was a couple years before the paper

1559
00:51:53,220 --> 00:51:54,780
 was accepted and published.

1560
00:51:54,780 --> 00:51:56,620
 And he called Bill Gates, the professor,

1561
00:51:56,620 --> 00:51:59,580
 and he said, "Good news, our pancake flipping paper

1562
00:51:59,580 --> 00:52:01,940
 "has been accepted and it's gonna be published."

1563
00:52:01,940 --> 00:52:04,640
 And he said, "Bill Gates seemed really disinterested

1564
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:06,180
 "in the fact that this was happening,"

1565
00:52:06,180 --> 00:52:09,500
 and that he was now working in a company in New Mexico

1566
00:52:09,500 --> 00:52:12,180
 that was writing code for microprocessors.

1567
00:52:12,180 --> 00:52:14,320
 And the professor said, "I remember thinking,

1568
00:52:14,320 --> 00:52:16,900
 "ah, such a brilliant kid, what a waste."

1569
00:52:16,900 --> 00:52:20,700
 (audience laughing)

1570
00:52:20,700 --> 00:52:21,540
 That's so good.

1571
00:52:21,540 --> 00:52:23,740
 We're gonna have to wrap up and it's like, guys.

1572
00:52:23,740 --> 00:52:25,420
 - Can I just study about his house quickly?

1573
00:52:25,420 --> 00:52:26,260
 - Yes.

1574
00:52:26,260 --> 00:52:28,660
 - Known as Zanadu 2.0.

1575
00:52:28,660 --> 00:52:30,580
 - Oh, yes, it's a semi, isn't it?

1576
00:52:30,580 --> 00:52:32,140
 Semi detached, three bed.

1577
00:52:32,140 --> 00:52:33,100
 Yeah, it's nice.

1578
00:52:33,100 --> 00:52:33,940
 - Very humble.

1579
00:52:33,940 --> 00:52:35,900
 It's a shared garden, one of those.

1580
00:52:35,900 --> 00:52:37,660
 Situations.

1581
00:52:37,660 --> 00:52:39,860
 It's got, I just don't understand this,

1582
00:52:39,860 --> 00:52:43,220
 it's got seven bedrooms and by one count,

1583
00:52:43,220 --> 00:52:47,940
 18.75 bathrooms and by another count, 24 bathrooms.

1584
00:52:47,940 --> 00:52:50,980
 It also has, well, according to a book hero in the '90s,

1585
00:52:50,980 --> 00:52:54,380
 one of the elements of which was describing his ideal home,

1586
00:52:54,380 --> 00:52:58,380
 it has guests get a badge when they enter that they wear

1587
00:52:58,380 --> 00:53:00,500
 and they put in their temperature

1588
00:53:00,500 --> 00:53:02,420
 and lighting preferences on their badge.

1589
00:53:02,420 --> 00:53:04,780
 And then whenever you walk into a new room,

1590
00:53:04,780 --> 00:53:07,260
 it automatically adjusts the temperature and lighting.

1591
00:53:07,260 --> 00:53:08,460
 And I don't know what it does

1592
00:53:08,460 --> 00:53:10,940
 if two of you walk into the room at the same time.

1593
00:53:10,940 --> 00:53:12,140
 - That is, yeah.

1594
00:53:12,140 --> 00:53:12,980
 - That's, oh my God.

1595
00:53:12,980 --> 00:53:14,620
 - I would hack the badges to murder people

1596
00:53:14,620 --> 00:53:15,940
 and that would be my plot.

1597
00:53:15,940 --> 00:53:16,780
 - What?

1598
00:53:16,780 --> 00:53:17,620
 - Why?

1599
00:53:17,620 --> 00:53:18,460
 - Why?

1600
00:53:18,460 --> 00:53:19,780
 (audience laughing)

1601
00:53:19,780 --> 00:53:21,900
 - Who likes having guests, really?

1602
00:53:21,900 --> 00:53:24,540
 (audience laughing)

1603
00:53:24,540 --> 00:53:26,540
 I'd send it to 1,000 degrees.

1604
00:53:26,540 --> 00:53:29,380
 (audience laughing)

1605
00:53:29,380 --> 00:53:30,220
 - Yeah.

1606
00:53:30,220 --> 00:53:31,740
 - A little paperclip turns up,

1607
00:53:31,740 --> 00:53:33,900
 it looks like you're trying to kill, kill, kill.

1608
00:53:33,900 --> 00:53:36,900
 (audience laughing)

1609
00:53:36,900 --> 00:53:40,380
 Okay, that is it.

1610
00:53:40,380 --> 00:53:41,900
 That is all of our facts.

1611
00:53:41,900 --> 00:53:42,740

 That is it.

1637
00:54:30,140 --> 00:54:30,980
 we can't believe we're here.
