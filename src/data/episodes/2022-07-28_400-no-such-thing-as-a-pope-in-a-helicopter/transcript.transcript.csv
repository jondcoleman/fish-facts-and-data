00:00:02,00:00:06,(speaking in foreign language)
00:00:06,00:00:09,(upbeat music)
00:00:09,00:00:16,- Hello and welcome to another episode
00:00:16,00:00:19,"of ""No Such Thing as a Fish,"" a weekly podcast,"
00:00:19,00:00:23,this week coming to you live from the London Palladium.
00:00:23,00:00:26,(audience cheering)
00:00:26,00:00:29,(audience cheering)
00:00:29,00:00:34,Tonight is also a very special episode for us.
00:00:34,00:00:37,"It is our 400th episode of ""Gang!"""
00:00:37,00:00:40,(audience cheering)
00:00:40,00:00:44,"My name is Dan Shriver, I'm sitting here"
00:00:44,00:00:47,"with Anna Tyshinski, Andrew Huntamari, and James Harkin."
00:00:47,00:00:49,"And once again, we have gathered around the microphones"
00:00:49,00:00:52,with our four favorite facts from the last seven days.
00:00:52,00:00:55,"And in a particular order, here we go."
00:00:55,00:00:59,"Starting with fact number one, and that is Anna."
00:00:59,00:01:02,- My fact this week is that there's a 300 square miles
00:01:02,00:01:05,section of America where all microwaves
00:01:05,00:01:08,have to be kept in cages.
00:01:08,00:01:10,(audience laughing)
00:01:10,00:01:13,- Are they living microwaves?
00:01:13,00:01:15,"They're scary, like teethy."
00:01:15,00:01:17,"- Violent, yes, some kryptonite was spilled on them"
00:01:17,00:01:21,in the '60s and haven't been able to keep control of them.
00:01:21,00:01:23,"No, this is, they're kept in specific cages."
00:01:23,00:01:25,I have misled you there slightly.
00:01:25,00:01:27,"They have to be kept in faraday cages,"
00:01:27,00:01:29,and that's 'cause it's in the quiet zone.
00:01:29,00:01:31,"So this is, the whole quiet zone"
00:01:31,00:01:34,"is actually about 13,000 square miles."
00:01:34,00:01:36,"And across that, radio transmissions"
00:01:36,00:01:38,and all electromagnetic transmissions
00:01:38,00:01:40,are really restricted.
00:01:40,00:01:42,"And within this little 300 square mile section,"
00:01:42,00:01:45,"which is right next to this Green Bank Observatory,"
00:01:45,00:01:47,"which is a few giant telescopes,"
00:01:47,00:01:48,"which are really, really important"
00:01:48,00:01:51,"for like seeing things from outer space,"
00:01:51,00:01:53,they need to have just no interruption.
00:01:53,00:01:56,And that means no waves of any sort.
00:01:56,00:01:58,"And that includes, if you're microwaving a burger"
00:01:58,00:01:59,"at two in the morning,"
00:01:59,00:02:02,that could convince them there's alien life out there.
00:02:02,00:02:04,So it's gotta go in a faraday cage.
00:02:04,00:02:06,- I've had a few burgers at two in the morning
00:02:06,00:02:08,that would convince me there's alien life out there.
00:02:08,00:02:09,(audience laughing)
00:02:09,00:02:12,"It is because of this observatory,"
00:02:12,00:02:14,although it also happens to be
00:02:14,00:02:15,where the National Security Agency
00:02:15,00:02:18,has one of its listening stations.
00:02:18,00:02:19,- Oh. - Which also happens
00:02:19,00:02:20,to be in the same area.
00:02:20,00:02:22,"- Wait, so what are they listening to?"
00:02:22,00:02:23,Are they listening to?
00:02:23,00:02:25,"- Well, they might need a lot of quiet,"
00:02:25,00:02:26,"so they can basically,"
00:02:26,00:02:28,they're listening to any foreign transmissions
00:02:28,00:02:31,that come into the eastern side of the United States.
00:02:31,00:02:32,- Right. - So it helps them
00:02:32,00:02:33,to be a bit quiet as well.
00:02:33,00:02:35,- Interesting. - Wow.
00:02:35,00:02:36,"- It's for anyone who wants peace and quiet, really."
00:02:36,00:02:37,- Yeah.
00:02:37,00:02:40,"- The NSA, these telescope guys,"
00:02:40,00:02:42,"weird conspiracy theorists, quite a lot of them there."
00:02:42,00:02:44,"- I know, it's a big mix of people, isn't it?"
00:02:44,00:02:45,- Yeah. - Yeah.
00:02:45,00:02:46,"- Conspiracy theorists, you've got your people"
00:02:46,00:02:48,"who believe that they suffer from a disease,"
00:02:48,00:02:50,"whereby Wi-Fi interferes with them,"
00:02:50,00:02:52,and they sometimes have to sleep in boxes
00:02:52,00:02:53,to get away from it.
00:02:53,00:02:55,- They should come to the QI office.
00:02:55,00:02:56,(audience laughs)
00:02:56,00:02:58,"- Oh, that was a joke about how shit our Wi-Fi is."
00:02:58,00:02:59,(audience laughs)
00:02:59,00:03:01,"- It was, we had a few of the elves in the audience,"
00:03:01,00:03:02,and they would have loved that joke.
00:03:02,00:03:05,"- Yeah, also we invited our IT guy tonight."
00:03:05,00:03:06,I know he's really shit.
00:03:06,00:03:08,(audience laughs)
00:03:08,00:03:08,"Sorry, buddy."
00:03:08,00:03:10,- It sounds just incredible.
00:03:10,00:03:12,"The list of restrictions there are,"
00:03:12,00:03:13,all because of this telescope.
00:03:13,00:03:15,So there are various things that aren't allowed.
00:03:15,00:03:17,"You know, like lots of stuff about Wi-Fi"
00:03:17,00:03:19,is technically banned.
00:03:19,00:03:22,Petrol-driven vehicles are not allowed
00:03:22,00:03:24,because they have spark plugs.
00:03:24,00:03:26,"So if you fire them up, that might do something."
00:03:26,00:03:27,- I thought this was so interesting.
00:03:27,00:03:30,"I did not know this, that if you are prone"
00:03:30,00:03:31,"to sort of wearing tinfoil hats or whatever,"
00:03:31,00:03:33,"and waves getting into your brain,"
00:03:33,00:03:35,"petrol cars, terrible."
00:03:35,00:03:36,"Diesel cars, fine."
00:03:36,00:03:38,Diesel is just compressed.
00:03:38,00:03:40,I guess I never properly understood the difference.
00:03:40,00:03:41,"Just really, really compressed"
00:03:41,00:03:42,until it's hot enough to ignite.
00:03:42,00:03:44,"Whereas petrol, you know, it needs a spark,"
00:03:44,00:03:46,"and that's giving off waves,"
00:03:46,00:03:47,and that's fucking with your brain.
00:03:47,00:03:50,(audience laughs)
00:03:50,00:03:53,"- It's not, I just want to clarify, it's not."
00:03:53,00:03:55,"- And the members of the public who live there,"
00:03:55,00:03:57,so it's a very small population there.
00:03:57,00:03:59,It's under 200 people that live there.
00:03:59,00:04:00,- This is just in the tiny inner bit.
00:04:00,00:04:02,"- In the tiny inner bit, yeah."
00:04:02,00:04:04,But they take it really seriously
00:04:04,00:04:06,about how they have to make sure
00:04:06,00:04:09,"that nothing is messing with this telescope,"
00:04:09,00:04:11,to the point where there's almost citizen police officers
00:04:11,00:04:14,"that go around driving in their car,"
00:04:14,00:04:17,"just looking every day for any kind of Wi-Fi signal,"
00:04:17,00:04:20,"or any, there was a guy called Wesley Sizemore,"
00:04:20,00:04:21,"and he used to just knock on doors,"
00:04:21,00:04:24,"and just go and walk in and go unplug your microwave,"
00:04:24,00:04:26,turn your Wi-Fi off.
00:04:26,00:04:30,"Yeah, he once, amazingly, tracked down the radio frequency"
00:04:30,00:04:34,interference of a faulty electric blanket in someone's house.
00:04:34,00:04:35,- Wow.
00:04:35,00:04:36,"- And he went into their house,"
00:04:36,00:04:38,and he confiscated it off them.
00:04:38,00:04:41,"- Just woke up a poor granny at three in the morning,"
00:04:41,00:04:43,and she got her awake.
00:04:43,00:04:44,"- There's a woman called Dr. Karen O'Neill,"
00:04:44,00:04:46,"who works at the observatory,"
00:04:46,00:04:48,and she says that she has members of her family
00:04:48,00:04:49,"who never visit them,"
00:04:49,00:04:52,because the lack of Wi-Fi stresses out the teenagers.
00:04:52,00:04:53,(audience laughing)
00:04:53,00:04:56,"- Yeah, that's why they're not getting visits."
00:04:56,00:04:57,"I'm so sorry, we'd love to,"
00:04:57,00:04:59,but the teenagers have to have their Wi-Fi.
00:04:59,00:05:02,"- Now, I think a lot of you are probably thinking like,"
00:05:02,00:05:04,"okay, you have to put the microwave in a Faraday cage."
00:05:04,00:05:06,"The first thing I thought was,"
00:05:06,00:05:07,isn't a microwave a Faraday cage?
00:05:07,00:05:08,- Yeah.
00:05:08,00:05:11,"- I thought that was kind of the whole point of microwaves,"
00:05:11,00:05:14,"but what it is, is microwaves do have Faraday cages in them,"
00:05:14,00:05:16,but they often leak.
00:05:16,00:05:17,- Yeah.
00:05:17,00:05:19,"- Okay, so you can test if you have a leaky microwave,"
00:05:19,00:05:21,so I tried this today at home.
00:05:21,00:05:23,I put my phone into the microwave
00:05:23,00:05:25,"and got my wife to call me,"
00:05:25,00:05:27,and I still got the call.
00:05:27,00:05:28,- What?
00:05:28,00:05:29,"- And I tried the one backstage,"
00:05:29,00:05:30,"we have a microwave backstage,"
00:05:30,00:05:31,"and I put my phone in there,"
00:05:31,00:05:32,"and one of the elves called me,"
00:05:32,00:05:33,"and I didn't get it,"
00:05:33,00:05:35,"so this one is a proper Faraday cage,"
00:05:35,00:05:36,but my one at home is a leaky one.
00:05:36,00:05:40,"- So, hang on, doesn't that break the microwave?"
00:05:40,00:05:42,"- No, it don't turn it on."
00:05:42,00:05:44,(audience laughing)
00:05:44,00:05:46,"- Well, just, well, don't."
00:05:46,00:05:50,"- We should say, in case anyone else was confused."
00:05:50,00:05:52,- Dinner tonight in the Harkin house.
00:05:52,00:05:54,(audience laughing)
00:05:54,00:05:56,- Cooked apple.
00:05:56,00:05:57,"- Oh, very nice."
00:05:57,00:06:00,(audience laughing)
00:06:00,00:06:02,"- There's a guy who has a van called Emit,"
00:06:02,00:06:05,"which is the electromagnetic interference tracking truck,"
00:06:05,00:06:07,which is a very forced acronym.
00:06:07,00:06:09,"But yeah, that might be who you were talking about,"
00:06:09,00:06:10,who drives around like the signals.
00:06:10,00:06:13,It's got 17 antennae on it.
00:06:13,00:06:15,"- Yeah, well this might be the new guy,"
00:06:15,00:06:16,but there's a new sheriff in town.
00:06:16,00:06:17,(audience laughing)
00:06:17,00:06:19,"- Yeah, 'cause yeah, Sizemore is retired,"
00:06:19,00:06:20,"so there's a new guy who goes,"
00:06:20,00:06:21,"and you can see photos,"
00:06:21,00:06:24,"and it is like in the X-Files,"
00:06:24,00:06:27,that van that's just full of computers and stuff.
00:06:27,00:06:29,"Yeah, it's amazing, and they all think"
00:06:29,00:06:30,that it's part of the observatory
00:06:30,00:06:32,"that is messing with their lives in various different ways,"
00:06:32,00:06:34,so there was a mother who called in
00:06:34,00:06:37,saying that she was getting interference on her TV
00:06:37,00:06:39,"because of the telescope,"
00:06:39,00:06:41,"so it just said N-R-A-O on her TV,"
00:06:41,00:06:44,"and she was like, ""You guys are breaking my TV."""
00:06:44,00:06:45,"So when someone came round,"
00:06:45,00:06:47,it turned out that that acronym N-R-A-O
00:06:47,00:06:50,"stood for not rated adults only,"
00:06:50,00:06:54,and it was because her son was trying to watch porn.
00:06:54,00:06:56,(audience laughing)
00:06:56,00:06:58,- Oh my God.
00:06:58,00:07:00,"- What a weird, people get imprisoned, I wonder."
00:07:00,00:07:02,"I mean, I know they don't, you get a small fine,"
00:07:02,00:07:03,but it's a strange crime to have done.
00:07:03,00:07:06,"- Yeah, it's a $50 fine, isn't it?"
00:07:06,00:07:08,But the truth is that due to the fact
00:07:08,00:07:09,"that no one has any money anymore,"
00:07:09,00:07:11,the police are not spending the time
00:07:11,00:07:14,"going around trying to prosecute people for this,"
00:07:14,00:07:17,and that means that actually most of the places
00:07:17,00:07:20,in that town now have Wi-Fi and have microwaves
00:07:20,00:07:22,"'cause they know that no one's gonna do anything,"
00:07:22,00:07:24,"and the observatory have kind of gone,"
00:07:24,00:07:25,"""Well fine, we'll deal with it,"
00:07:25,00:07:27,"""we'll work out what the background is,"
00:07:27,00:07:28,"""and we'll kind of deal with that."""
00:07:28,00:07:31,"The conspiracy theories who think it's fucking with their heads,"
00:07:31,00:07:32,they are not happy.
00:07:32,00:07:34,"- Right, of course."
00:07:34,00:07:36,"- No, they're the ones who are really upset about it."
00:07:36,00:07:37,- Yeah. - Wow.
00:07:37,00:07:38,- Yeah.
00:07:38,00:07:42,"- One ski resort, which they made an exception for,"
00:07:42,00:07:45,"which seems nice, always nice to let the old wealthy skiers"
00:07:45,00:07:48,"have a way around the rules that bind everyone else,"
00:07:48,00:07:50,"but that's Snowshoe Mountain,"
00:07:50,00:07:54,and it advertises itself as an oasis of cellular activity
00:07:54,00:07:56,"in an otherwise total dead zone,"
00:07:56,00:08:00,"and they got one of the, you know,"
00:08:00,00:08:03,cell companies to wire it up specifically
00:08:03,00:08:06,"so that it wouldn't really radiate any waves,"
00:08:06,00:08:09,"but that you can still call someone on the slopes and say,"
00:08:09,00:08:10,"""I've lost."" - But that's really,"
00:08:10,00:08:11,"it's really annoying, 'cause you will have,"
00:08:11,00:08:14,"I guess, reception at the start of the run,"
00:08:14,00:08:16,"but you're like, ""Yeah, yeah, this run's going really well,"
00:08:16,00:08:18,"""I'm just skiing down, hello, hello,"""
00:08:18,00:08:20,as you get further and further away.
00:08:20,00:08:21,"- I don't think it runs out, does it?"
00:08:21,00:08:23,"They don't just put it on the peaks,"
00:08:23,00:08:24,that would be terrifying.
00:08:24,00:08:26,"- But I guess also once you get it in the ski resorts,"
00:08:26,00:08:28,"then everyone's gonna want it, right?"
00:08:28,00:08:29,It's a slippery slope.
00:08:29,00:08:30,- Oh my God.
00:08:30,00:08:33,(audience laughing)
00:08:33,00:08:36,"- Yeah, so that whole area, you've got the ski slope,"
00:08:36,00:08:40,"you've got the neo-Nazi area,"
00:08:40,00:08:42,which is quite a popular area there.
00:08:42,00:08:43,"Yeah, yeah, there's a lot of neo-Nazis,"
00:08:43,00:08:45,"'cause basically, as we were saying before,"
00:08:45,00:08:47,it's kind of like people are going there
00:08:47,00:08:48,"for either to get away from technology,"
00:08:48,00:08:51,or they're going to a place where they can be a prepper
00:08:51,00:08:53,and effectively get away from all this stuff
00:08:53,00:08:55,and just live in isolation.
00:08:55,00:08:57,"So you've got the preppers, you've got the neo-Nazis,"
00:08:57,00:09:00,"you've got the slopes. - Sorry, why are the neo-Nazis"
00:09:00,00:09:01,being dumped in with the preppers
00:09:01,00:09:02,and the people who are afraid of technology?
00:09:02,00:09:03,I know the people who are afraid of technology
00:09:03,00:09:06,"are a bit silly, and the preppers are a bit nuts, but."
00:09:06,00:09:07,"- And the ski slope is,"
00:09:07,00:09:08,I'm just listing all the different communities.
00:09:08,00:09:10,- Why are the neo-Nazis there?
00:09:10,00:09:12,- Everyone's got to be somewhere.
00:09:12,00:09:15,(audience laughing)
00:09:15,00:09:16,- It's so nice to hear someone sticking up
00:09:16,00:09:18,"for the neo-Nazis there, it's really good."
00:09:18,00:09:19,- I will not.
00:09:19,00:09:23,"But my favorite one, just very quickly,"
00:09:23,00:09:26,"is the Gazuntai Institute is there as well,"
00:09:26,00:09:28,which was set up by Patch Adams.
00:09:28,00:09:30,"Do you remember the brilliant movie, Patch Adams?"
00:09:30,00:09:31,- It was Rock Williams.
00:09:31,00:09:32,"- Yeah, I've recognized that's a sentence"
00:09:32,00:09:34,"no one has ever said before, the brilliant movie."
00:09:34,00:09:36,"- So was he a real person, Patch Adams?"
00:09:36,00:09:38,"- He's a real person, and he wanted to set up"
00:09:38,00:09:40,"a hospital where it would be, you didn't have to pay,"
00:09:40,00:09:43,and they used humor instead of medicine.
00:09:43,00:09:45,(audience laughing)
00:09:45,00:09:46,And that's where that is as well.
00:09:46,00:09:48,- And they just read that laughter as the best medicine
00:09:48,00:09:49,and took it literally.
00:09:49,00:09:50,"- Yeah, he's a brilliant--"
00:09:50,00:09:52,"- I have heard of him, actually,"
00:09:52,00:09:53,is he the one who goes around
00:09:53,00:09:55,with the world's largest pair of underpants?
00:09:55,00:09:56,- That is him.
00:09:56,00:09:57,"- That is him, right?"
00:09:57,00:09:58,- Yes.
00:09:58,00:10:00,- And I think like the president of Costa Rica
00:10:00,00:10:01,and the president of Ecuador
00:10:01,00:10:03,have been in this giant underpants or something.
00:10:03,00:10:04,"- Yeah, you know him."
00:10:04,00:10:06,"- I know, yeah, I remember him."
00:10:06,00:10:07,"- Patch Adams, a legend."
00:10:07,00:10:09,- You've seen the sequels.
00:10:09,00:10:12,I don't think that was even in the film.
00:10:12,00:10:13,"- This telescope, just briefly,"
00:10:13,00:10:15,"the actual Green Bank telescope, it is unbelievable."
00:10:15,00:10:20,"Okay, so I don't even really fully grasp this."
00:10:20,00:10:23,It can measure the energy from billions of miles away
00:10:23,00:10:25,equivalent to a single snowflake
00:10:25,00:10:27,"falling onto the surface of the earth,"
00:10:27,00:10:28,but at any normal distance.
00:10:28,00:10:32,"- It must be tough when the ski season's up, yes."
00:10:32,00:10:32,- Oh my God!
00:10:32,00:10:36,"- Yeah, the energy that they're looking for"
00:10:36,00:10:39,"is the energy from extremely distant stars like quasars,"
00:10:39,00:10:41,"which are very, very bright, but they're a long way away,"
00:10:41,00:10:44,"and they can pick up, the energy that they give off,"
00:10:44,00:10:45,"all that gets to us here,"
00:10:45,00:10:48,is a billionth of a billionth of a millionth
00:10:48,00:10:51,"of one watt per square meter,"
00:10:51,00:10:53,"which is why this telescope needs to be so enormous,"
00:10:53,00:10:56,"it's two acres, the dish in capacity, in area,"
00:10:56,00:10:58,so that it can pick up those signals.
00:10:58,00:11:00,"Tiny things, they say, if you're on Saturn,"
00:11:00,00:11:01,"if you find yourself on Saturn,"
00:11:01,00:11:03,"and you put your phone on airplane mode,"
00:11:03,00:11:06,they can still detect it from there.
00:11:06,00:11:07,"- Wow, even on airplane mode?"
00:11:07,00:11:09,"- Even in airplane mode, so you can't get away with anything."
00:11:09,00:11:12,- I thought airplane mode was absolutely impregnable.
00:11:12,00:11:13,"- I'm afraid not,"
00:11:13,00:11:15,I'm afraid that's what the government wants you to believe.
00:11:15,00:11:17,"- Oh my God, I have to go!"
00:11:17,00:11:20,- How's anyone gonna give you a ring on Saturn?
00:11:20,00:11:20,- Hey.
00:11:20,00:11:26,- I reckon that's the last one of those I can get away with.
00:11:26,00:11:27,"- Oh, I don't know."
00:11:27,00:11:30,"- All I'm thinking is two, one, and I am."
00:11:30,00:11:32,Challenge accepted.
00:11:32,00:11:34,"What a shame that that's such an amazing fact,"
00:11:34,00:11:36,but the thing that sticks out for everyone
00:11:36,00:11:38,"is airplane mode, you can still find us."
00:11:38,00:11:40,"- That's the amazing bit, though."
00:11:40,00:11:43,"And the Saturn bit, but largely the airplane mode bit,"
00:11:43,00:11:45,'cause you're not supposed to be giving off anything.
00:11:45,00:11:47,"And another cool thing about the telescope is that,"
00:11:47,00:11:50,"so it's made of the huge dish,"
00:11:50,00:11:51,"which receives all the radio waves,"
00:11:51,00:11:54,"it's made of loads and loads of little panels,"
00:11:54,00:11:56,and it needs to be perfectly smooth.
00:11:56,00:11:58,"And actually, over the years,"
00:11:58,00:11:59,just the force of gravity
00:11:59,00:12:02,"would very, very slightly deform the panels."
00:12:02,00:12:05,"And so every panel has a tiny motor attached to it,"
00:12:05,00:12:08,"which senses, and as soon as it deforms by, you know,"
00:12:08,00:12:11,"a micrometer by the width of a couple of human hairs,"
00:12:11,00:12:14,the motor senses it and adjusts the panel
00:12:14,00:12:16,to make it smooth again. - That's amazing.
00:12:16,00:12:17,- It's pretty good.
00:12:17,00:12:19,- Another person who had a telescope
00:12:19,00:12:23,that needed a lot of work on it was William Herschel.
00:12:23,00:12:27,"He was a guy who discovered Uranus, and he was..."
00:12:27,00:12:29,"- No, yeah, come on. - No."
00:12:29,00:12:30,(audience laughs)
00:12:30,00:12:31,"No, I'm with them."
00:12:31,00:12:32,Say the proper name.
00:12:32,00:12:35,(audience laughs)
00:12:35,00:12:36,"- Herschel, is it?"
00:12:36,00:12:39,(audience laughs)
00:12:39,00:12:42,"So William Herschel, he discovered Uranus, or Uranus,"
00:12:42,00:12:46,"and he was really obsessed with his telescopes,"
00:12:46,00:12:49,"so much so that his sister, Caroline,"
00:12:49,00:12:53,spent her whole life basically polishing his telescope.
00:12:53,00:12:58,"And so now, I would accept Uranus, but come on."
00:12:58,00:13:04,"And also, he was so obsessed with searching for the stars,"
00:13:04,00:13:08,she had to feed him by putting food directly into his mouth.
00:13:08,00:13:10,- Wow. - 'Cause he was so on it.
00:13:10,00:13:11,And she's an amazing person.
00:13:11,00:13:14,"She basically was in Hanover,"
00:13:14,00:13:16,and then the French Army came in
00:13:16,00:13:17,"and they kind of took over Hanover,"
00:13:17,00:13:21,and then so William Herschel left there and came to the UK.
00:13:21,00:13:25,"He became an organist, and then she came over"
00:13:25,00:13:27,"and he started giving her singing lessons,"
00:13:27,00:13:30,"and then before long, she was a superstar in Bath and Bristol."
00:13:30,00:13:33,"She was singing five nights a week, she was massive,"
00:13:33,00:13:35,"but then when her brother wanted to become,"
00:13:35,00:13:38,"looking at the stars, she had to give it all up"
00:13:38,00:13:39,to just polish his telescope.
00:13:39,00:13:41,- Wow. (audience laughs)
00:13:41,00:13:43,"- And but then in the end, he died in the end,"
00:13:43,00:13:45,"and she took over his job,"
00:13:45,00:13:48,and she became famous as a discoverer
00:13:48,00:13:50,of no fewer than eight comets.
00:13:50,00:13:52,"And for her 96th birthday,"
00:13:52,00:13:54,Honbo presented her with a gold medal
00:13:54,00:13:55,for science from the King of Prussia.
00:13:55,00:13:57,- Wow. - Wow.
00:13:57,00:13:58,- How did the brother die?
00:13:58,00:14:00,Did he die mysteriously as a result of having received
00:14:00,00:14:02,no food for several weeks?
00:14:02,00:14:04,(audience laughs)
00:14:04,00:14:05,- We need to move on to our next fact.
00:14:05,00:14:09,"It is time for fact number two, and that is my fact."
00:14:09,00:14:12,"My fact this week is that the musician Ray Charles,"
00:14:12,00:14:15,"who was blind, used to fly to gigs"
00:14:15,00:14:18,because he thought it was safer than driving.
00:14:18,00:14:22,"However, he also insisted on flying the plane himself."
00:14:22,00:14:24,(audience laughs)
00:14:24,00:14:27,"This is an extraordinary claim,"
00:14:27,00:14:31,"and it's come up countless times from his friends,"
00:14:31,00:14:33,from his biographers.
00:14:33,00:14:36,"Supposedly, there was a plane that he used to,"
00:14:36,00:14:37,"that he owned, and he would charter,"
00:14:37,00:14:39,and he would bring all his band on.
00:14:39,00:14:41,"He had a few planes in his career,"
00:14:41,00:14:42,"and he used to have a pilot,"
00:14:42,00:14:44,"who was a friend of his called Tom McGarrity,"
00:14:44,00:14:48,"and when the plane had gone up and was at cruising level,"
00:14:48,00:14:51,he would get really bored and needed to pass the time.
00:14:51,00:14:54,"So there's reports of Ray Charles going into the cockpit,"
00:14:54,00:14:56,"sitting down at the controls,"
00:14:56,00:14:59,"and being handed over the controls from the pilot,"
00:14:59,00:15:01,and just flying the plane there for hours.
00:15:01,00:15:04,There's even stories that maybe he landed the plane
00:15:04,00:15:05,once or twice himself.
00:15:05,00:15:08,"- It's why they invented in-flight entertainment,"
00:15:08,00:15:10,"I think, isn't it?"
00:15:10,00:15:11,- To keep Ray Charles.
00:15:11,00:15:12,- To save pilot's lives.
00:15:12,00:15:14,"- Do you believe the stories, my question is that?"
00:15:14,00:15:15,"- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:15:15,00:15:16,- You believe he landed the plane.
00:15:16,00:15:17,"- No, I don't believe he landed it."
00:15:17,00:15:20,I do believe that he might have flown it.
00:15:20,00:15:21,- It's so funny.
00:15:21,00:15:23,"- I mean, but I don't know enough about planes to know that,"
00:15:23,00:15:26,"but there's Bobby Womack, for example,"
00:15:26,00:15:28,"who didn't know that he would do that,"
00:15:28,00:15:30,"was just sitting on the plane,"
00:15:30,00:15:31,and suddenly Ray Charles runs through the cockpit
00:15:31,00:15:33,"and takes over it, and he's going,"
00:15:33,00:15:34,"""Is everyone cool with this?"""
00:15:34,00:15:36,"And they are like, ""It's an incredible anecdote."""
00:15:36,00:15:38,"He says, ""Oh, Jesus me, oh, dear Lord."""
00:15:38,00:15:40,"He started praying, Bobby Womack."
00:15:40,00:15:41,"He said, ""There's a blind man flying the plane."
00:15:41,00:15:42,"""This is nonsense."""
00:15:42,00:15:44,And the trumpet player of Ray Charles' band
00:15:44,00:15:46,"just told him to relax and said,"
00:15:46,00:15:48,"""You don't need eyes to fly a plane."""
00:15:48,00:15:50,"Everyone was on a lot of heroin at this point,"
00:15:50,00:15:52,"obviously, by the way."
00:15:52,00:15:53,- Including Ray Charles.
00:15:53,00:15:54,- Including Ray Charles.
00:15:54,00:15:56,"- Yeah, they got there really quick."
00:15:56,00:15:57,- Yeah.
00:15:57,00:16:00,- What I find is that the closer you get to rail Charles
00:16:00,00:16:02,"for these anecdotes, the more it gets to,"
00:16:02,00:16:04,"less that he was flying or landing the plane,"
00:16:04,00:16:06,"and more that he knew how to do it,"
00:16:06,00:16:08,but he didn't necessarily do it.
00:16:08,00:16:09,- Yes.
00:16:09,00:16:09,- So it's interesting.
00:16:09,00:16:11,"- I don't know, if one of those inflatable things"
00:16:11,00:16:15,"can fly a plane, then I reckon Ray Charles can."
00:16:15,00:16:16,"- Are you talking about the movie ""Earth Plane""?"
00:16:16,00:16:17,- Yeah.
00:16:17,00:16:18,(laughing)
00:16:18,00:16:19,- That documentary.
00:16:19,00:16:21,"- That's pretty true to life, yeah."
00:16:21,00:16:23,"- Yeah, and I read his autobiography"
00:16:23,00:16:24,over the last couple of days.
00:16:24,00:16:26,"He doesn't mention it in there,"
00:16:26,00:16:29,"but again, he does say that he would know how to do it."
00:16:29,00:16:32,"If worse came to worst and everyone else on the plane died,"
00:16:32,00:16:34,he would be able to land it without killing himself.
00:16:34,00:16:35,That's what his claim was.
00:16:35,00:16:36,- He feels like he's done it.
00:16:36,00:16:37,"I mean, what else has he done?"
00:16:37,00:16:38,Memorised it in a book.
00:16:38,00:16:40,I don't think anyone would say they knew how to fly a plane
00:16:40,00:16:42,if they'd memorised the text.
00:16:42,00:16:43,"- Okay, can I tell you his technique"
00:16:43,00:16:45,that he was gonna use then to land it?
00:16:45,00:16:46,"- Oh, God."
00:16:46,00:16:47,"- Oh, yeah, this is awesome, yeah, yeah."
00:16:47,00:16:50,- So his technique was that he was gonna get all the dials
00:16:50,00:16:53,"'cause you need the dials to land, as well as your eyes."
00:16:53,00:16:56,But you need the dials and he was gonna smash all these dials
00:16:56,00:16:58,and he was gonna use his hand to feel
00:16:58,00:17:01,the way that the dials are moving all the time.
00:17:01,00:17:03,"- Well, no, no, 'cause there's one specific dial."
00:17:03,00:17:04,"I don't know if this is still an airplane,"
00:17:04,00:17:07,which is the shape of an airplane.
00:17:07,00:17:08,It's like literally an airplane.
00:17:08,00:17:10,"So he was like, I'd smash the glass"
00:17:10,00:17:11,and I would hold the airplane
00:17:11,00:17:14,and just feel it as we're going down
00:17:14,00:17:15,because that would tell you about the balance
00:17:15,00:17:17,"of the airplane and so on, yeah, so, yeah."
00:17:17,00:17:20,"So he would just, he would hold a toy airplane basically"
00:17:20,00:17:21,in order to land it.
00:17:21,00:17:25,"But he was someone who, if you were looking at other vehicles,"
00:17:25,00:17:28,he was someone who took charge of other vehicles.
00:17:28,00:17:30,So his son said that there was one day
00:17:30,00:17:32,where he was coming home in his Corvette
00:17:32,00:17:34,and the driver got to an intersection
00:17:34,00:17:37,"and he suddenly said, get out, I wanna drive it."
00:17:37,00:17:39,"And the valley said, I can't let you do that."
00:17:39,00:17:41,"And he said, it's my car."
00:17:41,00:17:42,"And he went, oh, okay, so he got out."
00:17:42,00:17:44,And so his son said they were sitting at home
00:17:44,00:17:47,and there was this huge crash and they went outside
00:17:47,00:17:50,and the car had totaled into the side of the house.
00:17:50,00:17:51,"- In fairness, what happened there"
00:17:51,00:17:53,is that he was on the clutch
00:17:53,00:17:55,and he'd accidentally let the clutch go
00:17:55,00:17:57,and it kind of jumped forward into a car that came past him.
00:17:57,00:17:58,"- So it's not even 'cause he's blind,"
00:17:58,00:17:59,he's just a shit driver.
00:17:59,00:18:00,- Yeah.
00:18:00,00:18:01,(laughing)
00:18:01,00:18:04,- He started car adverts in the '90s.
00:18:04,00:18:05,Have you seen that?
00:18:05,00:18:06,"- Oh, yeah."
00:18:06,00:18:07,- It's a gorgeous car advert
00:18:07,00:18:10,and it shows him driving on the salt flat.
00:18:10,00:18:11,You tell us Great Salt Lake.
00:18:11,00:18:13,"So he's not on a road, there are no other vehicles around,"
00:18:13,00:18:15,but he's having a whale of a time driving away.
00:18:15,00:18:16,It's lovely.
00:18:16,00:18:19,"And his driver, by the way, guess what his driver's name was?"
00:18:19,00:18:20,- I don't know.
00:18:20,00:18:22,- Clarence Driver.
00:18:22,00:18:24,"- Oh, that's cool."
00:18:24,00:18:26,- He had a long history of doing this.
00:18:26,00:18:28,So the first time he took control of a car
00:18:28,00:18:30,was when he was about eight
00:18:30,00:18:32,and this was when he was at primary school
00:18:32,00:18:33,and his teachers remembered him
00:18:33,00:18:36,"as kind of paid in the ass, I guess."
00:18:36,00:18:37,Kind of rebellious.
00:18:37,00:18:40,"And one time at primary school,"
00:18:40,00:18:43,he managed to break into one of the teacher's cars
00:18:43,00:18:44,and he went to a deaf and blind school.
00:18:44,00:18:45,It was quite groundbreaking.
00:18:45,00:18:47,It was the only one in Florida
00:18:47,00:18:49,"and he was sent there as,"
00:18:49,00:18:51,"he was about five when he was sent there,"
00:18:51,00:18:52,"five or six, wasn't he?"
00:18:52,00:18:53,Or maybe seven.
00:18:53,00:18:54,"- Well, he only went blind then."
00:18:54,00:18:55,He went blind at the edge of about six.
00:18:55,00:18:56,- Yes.
00:18:56,00:18:58,And then his mum just sent him to the school
00:18:58,00:18:59,"and yeah, he went there."
00:18:59,00:19:01,He got control of a teacher's car
00:19:01,00:19:04,and he had one of the deaf kids sit next to him
00:19:04,00:19:05,"or sit on the hood of the car, I think,"
00:19:05,00:19:08,and bang with either his left or right hand
00:19:08,00:19:10,to tell Ray to go left or right.
00:19:10,00:19:12,- This is a Gene Wilder film
00:19:12,00:19:14,"and Richard Pire called See No Evil, Hear No Evil."
00:19:14,00:19:15,It genuinely is.
00:19:15,00:19:17,"Yes, that's the plot of the film."
00:19:17,00:19:18,- Do they end up like he ended up
00:19:18,00:19:20,which was crashing into a tree?
00:19:20,00:19:21,"- Yeah, I think that happens quite a lot in the film."
00:19:21,00:19:23,It's a pretty...
00:19:23,00:19:25,- He also drove motorbikes from time to time.
00:19:25,00:19:27,"Definitely, this is in his autobiography."
00:19:27,00:19:30,"So when he was about 14 or 15, he was in Tallahassee"
00:19:30,00:19:32,and he would ride his motorbike.
00:19:32,00:19:33,"And the way that he did that,"
00:19:33,00:19:34,he would be in a big sort of area
00:19:34,00:19:37,with nothing else around in the same way as the advert.
00:19:37,00:19:40,"But in Tallahassee, he would ride in this area"
00:19:40,00:19:42,and his friend would be alongside him
00:19:42,00:19:44,so he could kind of feel him next to him
00:19:44,00:19:45,while he was motorcycling.
00:19:45,00:19:47,- So cool. - Yeah.
00:19:47,00:19:50,- He was better at music than he was at driving vehicles.
00:19:50,00:19:51,"- Oh, he was quite good."
00:19:51,00:19:54,"Like, I don't believe that he was in the airplane."
00:19:54,00:19:55,I believe he's in the airplane.
00:19:55,00:19:57,I don't believe he drove the airplane personally.
00:19:57,00:19:58,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:19:58,00:19:59,"- But if you read the biography,"
00:19:59,00:20:01,there's loads of stuff where he said at one stage
00:20:01,00:20:04,and the pilot forgot to pull the flaps down on the plane
00:20:04,00:20:06,and they weren't climbing properly
00:20:06,00:20:07,and he could sense the problem.
00:20:07,00:20:10,"And he said, ""You need to put the flaps down."""
00:20:10,00:20:12,"The pilot went, ""Is he wearing skies or is he Yoda?"""
00:20:12,00:20:14,- Yeah. (laughing)
00:20:14,00:20:15,- There was another time
00:20:15,00:20:17,"when they were flying at 11,000 feet."
00:20:17,00:20:19,"Okay, the traffic controller had told them"
00:20:19,00:20:21,"they need to fly at 11,000."
00:20:21,00:20:24,"And he said, ""But I had 13,000 in my head."
00:20:24,00:20:25,So I asked the pilot to check
00:20:25,00:20:28,"and sure enough, the controller had made a mistake."
00:20:28,00:20:29,Maybe we would have had enough height
00:20:29,00:20:31,"to get over the mountains anyway,"
00:20:31,00:20:32,"but I ain't want to take chances."""
00:20:32,00:20:33,(audience laughing)
00:20:33,00:20:34,- Oh my god.
00:20:34,00:20:35,- You got to play it slightly wrong.
00:20:35,00:20:38,"It's 30,000 feet in the air, I have."
00:20:38,00:20:39,(laughing)
00:20:39,00:20:41,"- So he was really, really into aeroplane."
00:20:41,00:20:43,"Like, he really knew a lot about them"
00:20:43,00:20:44,and he was properly into them.
00:20:44,00:20:45,But yeah.
00:20:45,00:20:47,- He really didn't like the idea of trading
00:20:47,00:20:48,on being a blind musician.
00:20:48,00:20:50,This is something I find really interesting.
00:20:50,00:20:53,"And he, in fact, it has to do with the instrument he played."
00:20:53,00:20:56,The fact that he was a pianist instead of a guitarist
00:20:56,00:21:00,"was because there were so many blind blues musicians,"
00:21:00,00:21:03,particularly who played the guitar.
00:21:03,00:21:04,"So there was Blind Lemon Jefferson,"
00:21:04,00:21:07,"Blind Willie Johnson, Blind Willie McTale,"
00:21:07,00:21:08,"Blind Blake, no other name."
00:21:08,00:21:10,"- This is non-negative determinism, isn't it?"
00:21:10,00:21:14,"- Blind Kerry Davis, Blind Boy Fuller and Blind Joe Reynolds."
00:21:14,00:21:16,"All of them, you know, were guitarists."
00:21:16,00:21:19,"And so he said, ""I don't want to be associated with that."""
00:21:19,00:21:21,He said it was as much an association with blindness
00:21:21,00:21:24,as a cane to walk with the guitar.
00:21:24,00:21:26,"- Although he did, he loved the piano from the age of three,"
00:21:26,00:21:27,"which really makes me think,"
00:21:27,00:21:30,"""I've missed the boat in finding my life's passion."""
00:21:30,00:21:32,"If that's when you've got to get it, he was three years old."
00:21:32,00:21:35,And he grew up in extreme poverty.
00:21:35,00:21:36,He really read about his early life.
00:21:36,00:21:40,"And he think, ""God, I suppose I'll never complain again."""
00:21:40,00:21:42,"You can imagine, like, a single mother,"
00:21:42,00:21:46,"dad's runoff, very, very poor, black family."
00:21:46,00:21:49,And he heard someone playing the piano
00:21:49,00:21:51,in the shop down the road.
00:21:51,00:21:53,"And he ran through, he was three years old."
00:21:53,00:21:55,"He sprinted across, pushed his way through the door,"
00:21:55,00:21:57,"jumped on his lap, and that was it."
00:21:57,00:22:00,He started banging away and knew he loved it from then on.
00:22:00,00:22:03,"And when he went to school, when he was sent to this school,"
00:22:03,00:22:05,"they would talk braille, obviously."
00:22:05,00:22:08,"And it was so hard to read piano music,"
00:22:08,00:22:10,"'cause, of course, you can only ever play while sight reading"
00:22:10,00:22:12,with your left hand.
00:22:12,00:22:13,"So he'd have his right hand fumbling away,"
00:22:13,00:22:15,"feeling the music while his left hand plays,"
00:22:15,00:22:17,"and then he'd have to swap, and then he'd have to memorize it."
00:22:17,00:22:20,And he could memorize thousands of pages like that.
00:22:20,00:22:21,"- Yeah, he was incredible."
00:22:21,00:22:23,"The braille stuff is really interesting,"
00:22:23,00:22:24,'cause he was very proud of the fact
00:22:24,00:22:28,that he could get on normally while being blind.
00:22:28,00:22:30,And so everything that he got was in braille.
00:22:30,00:22:32,"If a contract was sent to him and it wasn't in braille,"
00:22:32,00:22:34,he would refuse to sign it.
00:22:34,00:22:35,- I think that's fair enough.
00:22:35,00:22:37,"It feels like someone's trying to do one over on you,"
00:22:37,00:22:39,if that's what they're sending you.
00:22:39,00:22:40,- That's a good point.
00:22:40,00:22:45,"- No, but he got to see Ray, the movie, with Jamie Foxx,"
00:22:45,00:22:47,and they turned the script into braille for him
00:22:47,00:22:49,so that he could read it and sort of fact check it
00:22:49,00:22:50,and so on as it was going on.
00:22:50,00:22:52,- They should have made a 3D film
00:22:52,00:22:53,where he could feel the screen
00:22:53,00:22:55,and they're bulging out of it.
00:22:55,00:22:56,Why don't we have that?
00:22:56,00:22:58,"- Why don't we have a, I would."
00:22:58,00:23:00,Could it be cost-effective?
00:23:00,00:23:01,I don't know.
00:23:01,00:23:02,- I don't know.
00:23:02,00:23:03,- It's not very COVID secure.
00:23:03,00:23:06,"Everyone in the cinema, especially,"
00:23:06,00:23:07,everyone just groping forward at the screen.
00:23:07,00:23:08,"- And if you've got the seat,"
00:23:08,00:23:10,that's the top left corner of the screen.
00:23:10,00:23:12,You're not putting any action.
00:23:12,00:23:13,"He was really good at chess, wasn't he?"
00:23:13,00:23:15,And he had his own chess set
00:23:15,00:23:18,where the black squares were all raised slightly
00:23:18,00:23:19,and all the black pieces were pointy
00:23:19,00:23:21,and all the white pieces were round
00:23:21,00:23:22,so he could feel which was which.
00:23:22,00:23:23,- Yeah. - It was really cool.
00:23:23,00:23:26,- Did you read about him playing Willie Nelson at chess?
00:23:26,00:23:27,- Go on.
00:23:27,00:23:28,"- He played Willie Nelson,"
00:23:28,00:23:30,another great musician at chess.
00:23:30,00:23:31,He challenged Willie Nelson to a game
00:23:31,00:23:33,back in his hotel room or wherever he was
00:23:33,00:23:36,and obviously Ray Charles was blind
00:23:36,00:23:37,so he kept the lights off.
00:23:37,00:23:38,So...
00:23:38,00:23:39,(audience laughing)
00:23:39,00:23:40,"- You gotta save electricity, right?"
00:23:40,00:23:41,- To save electricity?
00:23:41,00:23:42,What's the point of lighting it?
00:23:42,00:23:44,So he thrashed Willie Nelson at chess.
00:23:44,00:23:45,(audience laughing)
00:23:45,00:23:48,And Willie Nelson couldn't fucking see what was going on.
00:23:48,00:23:49,That's so good.
00:23:49,00:23:51,"Do you, you had this really weird thing"
00:23:51,00:23:53,which I didn't believe for ages
00:23:53,00:23:55,but I've found enough sources
00:23:55,00:23:57,and the guy seems legit.
00:23:57,00:24:01,"During the '90s, he got really bored of giving interviews"
00:24:01,00:24:04,but he had to give interviews for promotional purposes.
00:24:04,00:24:07,"So instead, he got a white guy from New Jersey"
00:24:07,00:24:10,to be him in all the interviews that he did.
00:24:10,00:24:11,- No way. - Yeah.
00:24:11,00:24:13,So this is a producer and writer guy
00:24:13,00:24:17,"who interviewed him, a new Ray Charles inside out."
00:24:17,00:24:19,"When they had their interview, Ray was so impressed."
00:24:19,00:24:20,"He just thought, this is incredible."
00:24:20,00:24:21,We have to meet up again.
00:24:21,00:24:22,And then there was this interview
00:24:22,00:24:24,that was gonna happen with a guy.
00:24:24,00:24:27,The interviewer came over and Ray called him up.
00:24:27,00:24:30,"He calls him his white Ray Charles, this guy."
00:24:30,00:24:31,(audience laughing)
00:24:31,00:24:33,"And so he comes over and he says,"
00:24:33,00:24:35,I want you to do the interview as me
00:24:35,00:24:36,and give all the answers
00:24:36,00:24:38,'cause I can't be bothered doing it.
00:24:38,00:24:39,"So he said, okay, I'll do that."
00:24:39,00:24:41,So he sits there and he starts doing it
00:24:41,00:24:42,and the guy asks a question
00:24:42,00:24:44,"and he says, well, Ray would say that."
00:24:44,00:24:45,"And Ray said, no, no, no, no."
00:24:45,00:24:48,"Don't say Ray would say, say I would say,"
00:24:48,00:24:50,you are me in this interview.
00:24:50,00:24:52,And they did this whole interview where he was Ray
00:24:52,00:24:54,"and it went so well that Ray said,"
00:24:54,00:24:56,we must do that again.
00:24:56,00:24:58,"And for a decade, virtually."
00:24:58,00:24:59,- But not on television.
00:24:59,00:25:00,- Not on television.
00:25:00,00:25:01,This were all print interviews
00:25:01,00:25:04,"and people if they were calling up over the phone,"
00:25:04,00:25:05,he would do the interview.
00:25:05,00:25:07,Has read this white guy from New Jersey.
00:25:07,00:25:07,- That's amazing.
00:25:07,00:25:09,"- Yeah, that's so funny."
00:25:09,00:25:11,"And after Ray died, there was even a book,"
00:25:11,00:25:13,a photography that was taken by a personal friend
00:25:13,00:25:16,"who said to him, Ray can't write this book now."
00:25:16,00:25:18,Would you mind writing it as him?
00:25:18,00:25:20,He posed his death.
00:25:20,00:25:21,"He said, no, but yeah."
00:25:21,00:25:23,"- Is this where, did they have a fight at one point?"
00:25:23,00:25:24,"Ray's saying, what's all this shit"
00:25:24,00:25:25,about me driving a plane?
00:25:25,00:25:27,I'm glad you're stupid.
00:25:27,00:25:33,- He did one really fun thing when he was a kid.
00:25:33,00:25:37,"He, like I say, he was like a bit of a lovable troublemaker"
00:25:37,00:25:38,is the impression that I got.
00:25:38,00:25:41,And he used to love playing piano at school
00:25:41,00:25:43,"and there was another kid from,"
00:25:43,00:25:45,so the school was segregated
00:25:45,00:25:47,and there were a bunch of white kids
00:25:47,00:25:48,who got a better education
00:25:48,00:25:50,"and then the black kids basically like got less good,"
00:25:50,00:25:52,"got less good equipment, all of that."
00:25:52,00:25:54,And one of the white kids really wanted to come
00:25:54,00:25:56,"and play the piano, which was in the black kids'"
00:25:56,00:25:57,part of the school.
00:25:57,00:25:59,"And so this kid came up to Ray and said,"
00:25:59,00:26:01,I need to use a piano.
00:26:01,00:26:02,"You need to let me, you need to get off the piano."
00:26:02,00:26:03,I need to use it.
00:26:03,00:26:05,"So Ray said, fine, you can have it."
00:26:05,00:26:06,Just give me 15 minutes.
00:26:06,00:26:08,And this was related by his best friend
00:26:08,00:26:09,at the time who was a guy called Joe.
00:26:09,00:26:11,"And Joe said, I thought that was weird"
00:26:11,00:26:13,'cause Ray would never give up without a fight.
00:26:13,00:26:15,"And lo and behold, they were in their dorm,"
00:26:15,00:26:17,"like, you know, half an hour later"
00:26:17,00:26:19,and the white kid comes up furious
00:26:19,00:26:21,and Ray spent that 15 minutes
00:26:21,00:26:23,"unscrewing every single key on the piano,"
00:26:23,00:26:25,putting it in his bag.
00:26:25,00:26:27,"And they go, you said you're only one of the piano."
00:26:27,00:26:29,- That's so funny. - That's so funny.
00:26:29,00:26:32,- We've got to move on in a sec to our next fact.
00:26:32,00:26:35,- I just found one other guy who can fly their own aircraft.
00:26:35,00:26:37,"- What, what?"
00:26:37,00:26:37,- Put an unusual one.
00:26:37,00:26:39,"- Yeah, like there's a lot who can fly."
00:26:39,00:26:40,- Oh yeah. - What do you mean?
00:26:40,00:26:41,- Quite a few.
00:26:41,00:26:43,"- Well, this guy was Pope Benedict the 16th, Dan."
00:26:43,00:26:45,(laughing)
00:26:45,00:26:47,Is that unusual enough for you?
00:26:47,00:26:48,- Thank you.
00:26:48,00:26:51,- You've got to work on the lead-in to that.
00:26:51,00:26:52,"- Now look, this, I mean, James,"
00:26:52,00:26:54,"if you're skeptical about Ray Charles,"
00:26:54,00:26:57,"the idea of Benny the 16th flying the papal chopper,"
00:26:57,00:27:00,I've only found it on the website called Catholic News Facts
00:27:00,00:27:01,and it's only there.
00:27:01,00:27:03,And I feel like they'd have given it more airtime
00:27:03,00:27:04,as the Pope could fly a helicopter.
00:27:04,00:27:05,- How implausible was it?
00:27:05,00:27:07,Was he one of the sort of 17th century ones?
00:27:07,00:27:09,"I always find it hard to keep track of, was it at least?"
00:27:09,00:27:10,"- No, he was the last but one."
00:27:10,00:27:11,- Got it.
00:27:11,00:27:12,- The last but one.
00:27:12,00:27:13,"- The last one, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:27:13,00:27:14,- The one who resumed.
00:27:14,00:27:16,- So what's the story?
00:27:16,00:27:17,"Is he-- - He can fly a helicopter,"
00:27:17,00:27:18,"that's the story. - Okay, cool."
00:27:18,00:27:19,(laughing)
00:27:19,00:27:21,"- Well, thank God we didn't move on"
00:27:21,00:27:22,before you got that story in there.
00:27:22,00:27:25,(laughing)
00:27:25,00:27:26,- Wow.
00:27:26,00:27:28,"- Now it's time for fact number three,"
00:27:28,00:27:30,"and that is, oh, Andy."
00:27:30,00:27:32,- My factor is the Pope can fly a helicopter.
00:27:32,00:27:34,(laughing)
00:27:34,00:27:37,(cheering)
00:27:37,00:27:39,- Thank you.
00:27:39,00:27:41,- Solid gold.
00:27:41,00:27:45,"- I know, my fact is there is a zookeeper in America"
00:27:45,00:27:48,who cannot change job because the bird he looks after
00:27:48,00:27:49,is in love with him.
00:27:49,00:27:50,(laughing)
00:27:50,00:27:53,"It's, this is such a sweet story."
00:27:53,00:27:54,- I don't think it's very sweet.
00:27:54,00:27:57,"- Well, we'll get onto the real details in a minute,"
00:27:57,00:27:59,but the broad brushstrokes are very sweet.
00:27:59,00:28:02,"This was sent to me by a guy called Ali Bobson,"
00:28:02,00:28:03,"so thank you very much, Ali."
00:28:03,00:28:05,It's this brilliant Washington Post investigation.
00:28:05,00:28:08,"There is a crane, a crane to these very tall,"
00:28:08,00:28:10,very elegant birds.
00:28:10,00:28:12,And this one is very endangered.
00:28:12,00:28:14,"It is a white napped crane,"
00:28:14,00:28:16,"unbelievably rare and endangered,"
00:28:16,00:28:19,and it lives at the Smithsonian Conservation Institute
00:28:19,00:28:19,in Virginia.
00:28:19,00:28:21,There's a breeding center there.
00:28:21,00:28:22,They had this bird.
00:28:22,00:28:24,It was a female bird needed to be bred with
00:28:24,00:28:27,"to preserve the species, but it was a deadly bird."
00:28:27,00:28:31,It allegedly had killed at least two previous partners
00:28:31,00:28:32,rather than mate with them.
00:28:32,00:28:33,"It wasn't taking any shit, yeah."
00:28:33,00:28:38,"So problem, and they realized maybe it has imprinted"
00:28:38,00:28:40,"when it was a young chick,"
00:28:40,00:28:44,it thought a human was its parent rather than a crane bird.
00:28:44,00:28:46,So it is programmed to love humans.
00:28:46,00:28:49,And so they got this keeper who is called Mr. Crow.
00:28:49,00:28:50,Amazing.
00:28:50,00:28:51,(audience laughing)
00:28:51,00:28:52,Chris Crow.
00:28:52,00:28:53,- Don't jump.
00:28:53,00:28:55,"- Jump, jump."
00:28:55,00:28:56,(audience laughing)
00:28:56,00:28:58,"Sorry, it just sounds like it."
00:28:58,00:28:59,- Chris Cross.
00:28:59,00:29:00,- Chris Cross.
00:29:00,00:29:01,"- Don't get it, don't get it."
00:29:01,00:29:03,But they loved it.
00:29:03,00:29:07,"And so they, in Chris Crow and Warner"
00:29:07,00:29:09,are now basically an item.
00:29:09,00:29:12,"And they have done a lot of work,"
00:29:12,00:29:13,breeding work together.
00:29:13,00:29:14,(audience laughing)
00:29:14,00:29:16,"- And this is where it gets a bit icky, yeah."
00:29:16,00:29:18,- This is where it gets a fraction icky
00:29:18,00:29:20,"if you're squeamish, yeah."
00:29:20,00:29:23,- So he slowly earned the female cranes trust
00:29:23,00:29:28,by sitting with her and touching her and all that stuff.
00:29:28,00:29:31,"And dancing, like dancing with her is the main thing."
00:29:31,00:29:33,"Like a lot of the cranes, before they get together,"
00:29:33,00:29:35,they do this kind of head bobbing dance and stuff.
00:29:35,00:29:37,And he did all that with her as well.
00:29:37,00:29:39,"When no one was looking, he said."
00:29:39,00:29:43,"And now, basically, she will let him inseminate her."
00:29:43,00:29:46,"'Cause previously, if you had a crane"
00:29:46,00:29:48,"and you needed to artificially inseminate them,"
00:29:48,00:29:49,"you'd probably have to use that aesthetic,"
00:29:49,00:29:50,all that kind of stuff.
00:29:50,00:29:52,She is well up for it.
00:29:52,00:29:53,- Yeah.
00:29:53,00:29:53,(audience laughing)
00:29:53,00:29:55,"- And he doesn't, we should clarify,"
00:29:55,00:29:57,inseminate her with his own seed.
00:29:57,00:29:59,(laughing)
00:29:59,00:30:02,And he does remain fully clothed throughout this process.
00:30:02,00:30:06,He puts a different crane sperm into her cloaca.
00:30:06,00:30:09,"Actually, interestingly, the other crane is called Ray."
00:30:09,00:30:11,"- No, really."
00:30:11,00:30:12,"- It's a different one, different Ray."
00:30:12,00:30:13,"- Different Ray, yeah."
00:30:13,00:30:14,(audience laughing)
00:30:14,00:30:15,"- The article you sent around, though, Andy,"
00:30:15,00:30:19,"it does, like, as James says, it reads a bit bizarre."
00:30:19,00:30:21,"So, like, literally taking the words,"
00:30:21,00:30:24,"it says, kneeling behind the bird."
00:30:24,00:30:25,"Oh, don't put that tone of voice on it."
00:30:25,00:30:27,"If you don't, wait a minute, like that."
00:30:27,00:30:29,It'll make anything sound mucky.
00:30:29,00:30:32,Crow rests a hand gently on her back.
00:30:32,00:30:33,(audience laughing)
00:30:33,00:30:36,Then he starts rubbing her thighs.
00:30:36,00:30:40,"Rhythmically, 30 seconds elapsed."
00:30:40,00:30:42,"Before Walnut steps away, it's called Walnut, by the way."
00:30:42,00:30:44,(audience laughing)
00:30:44,00:30:46,"Walnut steps away from Crow,"
00:30:46,00:30:48,"fixes a few out-of-place feathers,"
00:30:48,00:30:50,"and then stretches out her wings,"
00:30:50,00:30:53,asking for another go-around.
00:30:53,00:30:54,(audience laughing)
00:30:54,00:30:55,"- Dan, if this is your audition tape"
00:30:55,00:30:58,"for my dad wrote a porno, it means a lot of work."
00:30:58,00:31:00,"- And then it says, ""Crow then takes the opportunity"
00:31:00,00:31:02,"""to inject Walnut with a syringe of crane semen."""
00:31:02,00:31:04,(audience laughing)
00:31:04,00:31:06,Like every beautiful relationship.
00:31:06,00:31:09,"- But she keeps on wanting to mate with him,"
00:31:09,00:31:10,"even though at the moment,"
00:31:10,00:31:13,they don't need any more eggs from her.
00:31:13,00:31:15,"But sometimes, he will just keep her happy"
00:31:15,00:31:17,by doing the massage.
00:31:17,00:31:19,"- And he gives fake eggs, doesn't he?"
00:31:19,00:31:20,- Yes.
00:31:20,00:31:22,"- 'Cause you can't give a social create eggs,"
00:31:22,00:31:24,"but they don't need to be inseminated anymore,"
00:31:24,00:31:25,so they'll just sit and rot.
00:31:25,00:31:26,So they have to chop the eggs out
00:31:26,00:31:28,and put fake eggs underneath her
00:31:28,00:31:30,to convince her that she's doing good jobs at night.
00:31:30,00:31:31,"- But then she gets tired,"
00:31:31,00:31:33,"she gets tired looking after the fake eggs,"
00:31:33,00:31:35,which he has switched out.
00:31:35,00:31:37,So he sometimes has to stand over the eggs
00:31:37,00:31:38,"and watch them for her,"
00:31:38,00:31:40,"even though he knows they're fake,"
00:31:40,00:31:43,so that she can have a break
00:31:43,00:31:45,from looking after these rubber eggs.
00:31:45,00:31:46,"- I feel it, it does feel like"
00:31:46,00:31:48,"he's going himself into a bit of a bind, doesn't it?"
00:31:48,00:31:49,"- I know, it's so funny."
00:31:49,00:31:51,- Last we heard he was single.
00:31:51,00:31:56,"As far as human partners is concerned,"
00:31:56,00:31:57,"he said in one interview,"
00:31:57,00:32:00,"""Walnut sets the bar pretty high."
00:32:00,00:32:02,"""I'll never find a woman that's so happy to see me"
00:32:02,00:32:05,"""that she just starts dancing."""
00:32:05,00:32:06,- It's so sweet.
00:32:06,00:32:09,- It's like a roller coaster of sweetness
00:32:09,00:32:10,"and ickyness, isn't it?"
00:32:10,00:32:12,- He has cheated on her though.
00:32:12,00:32:13,- What?
00:32:13,00:32:16,"- Yeah, he's inseminated two other cranes."
00:32:16,00:32:17,- Okay.
00:32:17,00:32:18,- He's got a type.
00:32:18,00:32:19,I'm not denying that.
00:32:19,00:32:23,- Are they in the same zoo?
00:32:23,00:32:23,- Yeah.
00:32:23,00:32:24,"- Yeah, they are in the same zoo,"
00:32:24,00:32:27,but I don't think Walnut knows about so.
00:32:27,00:32:28,- I hope she doesn't listen to this.
00:32:28,00:32:32,"- Yeah, but that would be terrible."
00:32:32,00:32:34,"- But no, he's now a kind of love guru"
00:32:34,00:32:36,for the cranes in this place.
00:32:36,00:32:38,"- Really, he knows it, yeah."
00:32:38,00:32:40,- And apparently the way the cranes flirt
00:32:40,00:32:42,"most effectively, aside from this dance,"
00:32:42,00:32:44,"is by picking up nesting material,"
00:32:44,00:32:46,"'cause showing that you want to build a home together,"
00:32:46,00:32:48,"aw, again, we're back into sweet,"
00:32:48,00:32:50,sort of in a 1950s kind of way.
00:32:50,00:32:53,- Have you ever tried going on a date around John Lewis?
00:32:53,00:32:56,"It's very, it's sexy stuff, yeah."
00:32:56,00:32:57,"- It's much like that,"
00:32:57,00:33:00,"except that John Lewis saw the sticks and twigs,"
00:33:00,00:33:01,bits of grass.
00:33:01,00:33:03,"- Yeah, there are, I mean, this is not the first,"
00:33:03,00:33:04,Chris Crowe did not invent this
00:33:04,00:33:06,"in case anyone was looking for, you know,"
00:33:06,00:33:09,"this is not the first human crane marriage, as it were."
00:33:09,00:33:13,"The real daddy of this,"
00:33:13,00:33:15,I regret saying daddy already.
00:33:15,00:33:18,"There's a scientist called George Archibald,"
00:33:18,00:33:21,who is a don of the crane world.
00:33:21,00:33:23,He founded the International Crane Foundation.
00:33:23,00:33:27,"Just to give you an idea, he's pretty big in Crane Town."
00:33:27,00:33:29,"And he, in 1976, there was a bird called Tex,"
00:33:29,00:33:32,which again needed to be mated with to preserve the species.
00:33:32,00:33:35,"And he moved in next to her for three months,"
00:33:35,00:33:39,"as in he put his bed next to her area where she lived,"
00:33:39,00:33:42,mimicked her dance moves from five a.m. every morning.
00:33:42,00:33:44,"- Wow, wow. - Was truly dedicated."
00:33:44,00:33:45,And they built a nest together.
00:33:45,00:33:48,"And they worked together for, worked together for..."
00:33:48,00:33:50,(laughing)
00:33:50,00:33:52,"- She's my colleague, darling, honestly."
00:33:52,00:33:55,I just have to be in the office early again.
00:33:55,00:33:57,- I think he might have invented the practice
00:33:57,00:34:00,"of dressing up as a crane,"
00:34:00,00:34:03,which you now have to do to feed chicks
00:34:03,00:34:05,"so that this problem doesn't perpetuate itself,"
00:34:05,00:34:07,so that the chicks don't imprint on humans.
00:34:07,00:34:08,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:34:08,00:34:10,"- Well, you dress your hand up as a crane for the feeding,"
00:34:10,00:34:11,"don't you? - Yeah, it's interesting."
00:34:11,00:34:12,- You get like a glove puppet.
00:34:12,00:34:14,"- Like you're in like a full white hood, aren't you?"
00:34:14,00:34:16,And then you have like the bird's hand.
00:34:16,00:34:18,You're not like Rod Hull.
00:34:18,00:34:21,"If he joined the KKK, that's what it would look like."
00:34:21,00:34:23,- He moved to that little community
00:34:23,00:34:25,"in Green Valley, the observatory."
00:34:26,00:34:28,And you can never say a word.
00:34:28,00:34:31,You can't speak words to them when you're in the robe.
00:34:31,00:34:32,"You have to make crane noises, obviously."
00:34:32,00:34:35,"- How do they, do you know how they sound?"
00:34:35,00:34:36,Just out of curiosity.
00:34:36,00:34:37,- I don't know.
00:34:37,00:34:39,(laughing)
00:34:39,00:34:40,- No.
00:34:40,00:34:41,"- 'Cause they're like, I didn't realize"
00:34:41,00:34:45,I didn't know cranes that well up until this fact.
00:34:45,00:34:46,They're massive.
00:34:46,00:34:47,"- Yeah, they're huge, they're huge."
00:34:47,00:34:49,"- They can be up to six foot, six tall."
00:34:49,00:34:51,"Like that's a big ass bird, right?"
00:34:51,00:34:53,- Yeah.
00:34:53,00:34:54,"- They're the biggest, biggest flying ones,"
00:34:54,00:34:56,"tallest flying ones, aren't they?"
00:34:56,00:34:57,Obviously you've got the shit ones
00:34:57,00:34:59,like the ostrich that don't count anymore.
00:34:59,00:35:00,(laughing)
00:35:00,00:35:02,"- Yeah, that's right, they fly so high."
00:35:02,00:35:03,- Yeah.
00:35:03,00:35:05,"- They can get like 30,000 feet in the air."
00:35:05,00:35:06,"- Well, they're very tall, yeah."
00:35:06,00:35:07,(laughing)
00:35:07,00:35:09,- Their legs are still on the ground
00:35:09,00:35:09,for a lot of that time.
00:35:09,00:35:11,- That's true.
00:35:11,00:35:12,"That's amazing, isn't it?"
00:35:12,00:35:14,And there's a lot of mythology around them
00:35:14,00:35:16,because they can fly so high
00:35:16,00:35:18,that they disappear from your actual eyesight.
00:35:18,00:35:19,You can't see them.
00:35:19,00:35:22,But their voices still at that height
00:35:22,00:35:24,are so booming that you can hear them.
00:35:24,00:35:26,"So it's a sort of like, oh, there's a crane in the air."
00:35:26,00:35:27,"- They make a lot of noise, don't they?"
00:35:27,00:35:30,Their track here is as long as they are.
00:35:30,00:35:32,"But it kind of winds around a little bit,"
00:35:32,00:35:34,but they make this huge booming.
00:35:34,00:35:35,"Not like, and he's, ""Wah!"""
00:35:35,00:35:36,- Yeah.
00:35:36,00:35:37,"- It's more like, ""Wah!"""
00:35:37,00:35:38,(laughing)
00:35:38,00:35:40,"- Neither of you is successfully seducing a crane,"
00:35:40,00:35:42,is my judgment.
00:35:42,00:35:42,- We'll get lettuce.
00:35:42,00:35:45,"- Yeah, so they need to fly high to migrate."
00:35:45,00:35:46,They're big old migrators.
00:35:46,00:35:48,"And there's an issue now,"
00:35:48,00:35:51,"'cause a lot of them are very endangered, like you said."
00:35:51,00:35:54,And I think certain cranes at the Hooper Cranes
00:35:54,00:35:57,were down to almost single figures in about the 1940s.
00:35:57,00:35:59,But their populations have gone up.
00:35:59,00:36:02,It's been like quite a success story of conservation.
00:36:02,00:36:05,But the way they've gone up is by humans raising them.
00:36:05,00:36:06,And this has a slight problem
00:36:06,00:36:08,"where if their parents aren't raising them,"
00:36:08,00:36:10,they're not really evolving to know their migration routes.
00:36:10,00:36:12,So there's been a couple of people
00:36:12,00:36:15,who have had to migrate with them.
00:36:15,00:36:16,"And they do this by,"
00:36:16,00:36:18,"I don't know if anyone's seen the film, Fly Away Home."
00:36:18,00:36:20,But it's basically that.
00:36:20,00:36:22,"So you get a microlight for anyone who hasn't,"
00:36:22,00:36:24,like a little light aircraft.
00:36:24,00:36:26,And you still have to be dressed up as a crane.
00:36:26,00:36:28,So I don't know what the crane fucking thinks now.
00:36:28,00:36:31,"- I think the Pope did this once, didn't he?"
00:36:31,00:36:33,(audience laughing)
00:36:33,00:36:35,So do you have to stay in costume when you're flying?
00:36:35,00:36:37,"- Yes, so now the cranes all think"
00:36:37,00:36:40,that their leading crane knows how to fly a microlight.
00:36:40,00:36:44,"And the first person who did this was a guy called Kent Clegg,"
00:36:44,00:36:48,"who was like Nick Clegg's very much cooler older brother,"
00:36:48,00:36:50,biologist and a craneer in the '90s.
00:36:50,00:36:54,"And yeah, he flew with them, it's an 850 mile journey."
00:36:54,00:36:58,"And he flew with them down from basically Idaho,"
00:36:58,00:37:01,"which is on the Canadian border basically, to New Mexico."
00:37:01,00:37:04,"And others have been doing it still, but..."
00:37:04,00:37:06,"- I think in 2015, the US decided"
00:37:06,00:37:08,that they were gonna try and stop doing it
00:37:08,00:37:10,"because of the problem of,"
00:37:10,00:37:14,that the cranes learn better from other cranes basically.
00:37:14,00:37:16,"So now that there's quite a lot more of them,"
00:37:16,00:37:18,"they're in the hundreds now, they're thinking let's phase it out."
00:37:18,00:37:21,"- Yeah, well, they basically weren't mating."
00:37:21,00:37:23,The whole point of migrating is to go up and mate.
00:37:23,00:37:27,"So you fly to have kids up in Canada or whatever,"
00:37:27,00:37:28,"and so they flew them there,"
00:37:28,00:37:32,but then the humans didn't know how to show them how to mate.
00:37:32,00:37:33,- Send for crew!
00:37:33,00:37:36,(audience laughing)
00:37:36,00:37:37,- Just awkwardly making conversation
00:37:37,00:37:41,with each other for three months and then going home.
00:37:41,00:37:42,"- There's a really prosaic example of that,"
00:37:42,00:37:45,teaching the cranes what goes on.
00:37:45,00:37:47,It's like you're raising them as a person in a costume
00:37:47,00:37:50,"with a glove puppet, a weird glove puppet on your arm,"
00:37:50,00:37:51,"and you're not allowed to speak,"
00:37:51,00:37:53,but also they are taught to be afraid of foxes
00:37:53,00:37:55,because that's not instinctive to them.
00:37:55,00:37:56,So they have to be taught.
00:37:56,00:37:59,And the way you teach them is to dress up dogs as foxes
00:37:59,00:38:01,and get them to harass them.
00:38:01,00:38:01,- Oh really? - Yeah.
00:38:01,00:38:04,- This is so the humans are dressed as cranes.
00:38:04,00:38:05,(audience laughing)
00:38:05,00:38:06,Who's dressed as a fox?
00:38:06,00:38:08,The dogs are dressed as foxes. - The dogs are dressed as foxes.
00:38:08,00:38:10,"- The cranes are dressed, who's the cranes dressed as?"
00:38:10,00:38:12,They're all dressed as the Pope.
00:38:12,00:38:14,(audience laughing)
00:38:14,00:38:16,"- Is the weirdest nativity ever, isn't it?"
00:38:16,00:38:17,- They're amazing.
00:38:17,00:38:18,But they're back in the UK.
00:38:18,00:38:20,This is a huge victory for conservation.
00:38:20,00:38:24,They are the first crane egg laid in Britain
00:38:24,00:38:27,since about the year 1600 was in 2013.
00:38:27,00:38:31,And it was given a 24 hour guard 'cause it was so precious.
00:38:31,00:38:34,And now the numbers are rising in the UK
00:38:34,00:38:35,"and it's a huge success story, so it's really good."
00:38:35,00:38:36,"- Yes, great."
00:38:36,00:38:38,- They've done a fabulous job on it.
00:38:38,00:38:40,"- Yeah, amazing. - It's a hooray for Chris Crow."
00:38:40,00:38:43,(audience cheering)
00:38:43,00:38:46,"- Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show"
00:38:46,00:38:47,and that is James.
00:38:47,00:38:50,"- Okay, my fact this week is that Bill Gates"
00:38:50,00:38:55,is responsible for putting chips in up to 80% of Americans.
00:38:55,00:38:56,(audience laughing)
00:38:56,00:38:57,- You're right.
00:38:57,00:38:59,"Get to that quiet zone in America, James,"
00:38:59,00:39:00,where you belong.
00:39:00,00:39:02,"- What websites have you been on, James?"
00:39:02,00:39:05,"- Well, I learned this fact from an anonymous video"
00:39:05,00:39:06,posted on Facebook.
00:39:06,00:39:09,(audience laughing)
00:39:09,00:39:09,"- No, of course not."
00:39:09,00:39:12,- That's why I got the Pope helicopter thing.
00:39:12,00:39:13,"- No, of course not."
00:39:13,00:39:15,So this is a story from a few years ago
00:39:15,00:39:18,that Bill Gates has bought up hundreds and thousands
00:39:18,00:39:20,of acres of land in America.
00:39:20,00:39:22,"On that land, he grows potatoes."
00:39:22,00:39:25,He sells those potatoes to McDonald's
00:39:25,00:39:26,and they sell chips
00:39:26,00:39:28,and Americans put them in their face holes.
00:39:28,00:39:33,And so 80% of Americans up to have got chips from Bill Gates.
00:39:33,00:39:35,- So good.
00:39:35,00:39:38,(audience applauding)
00:39:38,00:39:39,- There we go.
00:39:39,00:39:40,"- Yeah, it's incredible."
00:39:40,00:39:41,- And of course he does it in the vaccines.
00:39:41,00:39:43,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:39:43,00:39:44,- Thank you.
00:39:44,00:39:44,- Yeah.
00:39:44,00:39:45,(audience laughing)
00:39:45,00:39:49,"But yeah, he's one of the few people in the world"
00:39:49,00:39:52,who has a McDonald's gold card.
00:39:52,00:39:54,And I don't know if it's connected to this.
00:39:54,00:39:55,- What's that?
00:39:55,00:39:57,- McDonald's gold card is where you can go
00:39:57,00:39:59,"to any McDonald's, you hand it in,"
00:39:59,00:40:00,"and no matter what you've ordered,"
00:40:00,00:40:01,they give it to you for free.
00:40:01,00:40:02,"- Oh, thank God."
00:40:02,00:40:03,"'Cause otherwise, how would he be able"
00:40:03,00:40:05,to afford a Big Mac?
00:40:05,00:40:06,(audience laughing)
00:40:06,00:40:08,"- Well, they do that, so we don't have it in the UK."
00:40:08,00:40:11,"What we have is the Nando's Black Card,"
00:40:11,00:40:12,"which is quite a famous card,"
00:40:12,00:40:14,which I've experienced a couple of times.
00:40:14,00:40:16,"It's like, I have, yeah."
00:40:16,00:40:17,Couple of friends of mine have had it.
00:40:17,00:40:21,"So Tom Davis, who is a King Gary, he once had it."
00:40:21,00:40:22,He applied for it.
00:40:22,00:40:24,He got brought in front of the chicken council.
00:40:24,00:40:25,- Stop.
00:40:25,00:40:25,"- Yeah, no, stop."
00:40:25,00:40:27,"And he had to, are they dressed as chickens?"
00:40:27,00:40:30,"Or are they, had he had to make his case"
00:40:30,00:40:31,to the chicken council?
00:40:31,00:40:34,"- First of all, he stands behind the chicken,"
00:40:34,00:40:35,(audience laughing)
00:40:35,00:40:36,caresses the thigh.
00:40:36,00:40:40,(audience laughing)
00:40:40,00:40:41,"- And then I had another friend who,"
00:40:41,00:40:44,"and bear in mind, like, Ant and Deck had to share one."
00:40:44,00:40:45,That's the story going on.
00:40:45,00:40:46,- It's so nice.
00:40:46,00:40:47,"- He's a hell of a rare, the Black Card."
00:40:47,00:40:48,- They go everywhere together.
00:40:48,00:40:49,What's the point of giving them two?
00:40:49,00:40:50,"- Yeah, there's no part giving them two."
00:40:50,00:40:50,"- Yeah, that's true, yeah."
00:40:50,00:40:51,"- Well, that's what keeps them together,"
00:40:51,00:40:53,is just the Black Nando's card.
00:40:53,00:40:55,They've hated each other 20 years.
00:40:55,00:40:58,"- But so, he has this gold card,"
00:40:58,00:41:00,"and only quite a few Americans have it,"
00:41:00,00:41:01,the McDonald's card.
00:41:01,00:41:02,- I think it's not related.
00:41:02,00:41:04,I think that's just because he's really rich.
00:41:04,00:41:05,- Fair enough.
00:41:05,00:41:06,- Oh. - Fair enough.
00:41:06,00:41:09,"- He gets involved in some funny old games, doesn't he?"
00:41:09,00:41:11,"'Cause since he became the richest man in the world,"
00:41:11,00:41:12,"and then started, he just started investing"
00:41:12,00:41:14,"in lots of things, but also, obviously,"
00:41:14,00:41:16,"huge amounts of, you know, very worthy stuff,"
00:41:16,00:41:19,and trying to beat malaria and this kind of thing.
00:41:19,00:41:24,"In 2009, he paid $50 million to circumcise 650,000 men."
00:41:24,00:41:27,(audience laughing)
00:41:27,00:41:29,"- Okay, you gotta give that some context."
00:41:29,00:41:31,"Otherwise, it feels like it's not fair on him."
00:41:31,00:41:33,"- It was a project attempting to curb HIV,"
00:41:33,00:41:36,"because there are studies, some studies that show"
00:41:36,00:41:38,"that circumcision lowers the risk of becoming infected,"
00:41:38,00:41:39,and he funded the program.
00:41:39,00:41:41,"- Ah, so he wasn't literally there."
00:41:41,00:41:43,"- No, he insisted, that's part of it."
00:41:43,00:41:44,"He said, ""I'm gonna give you $50 million,"
00:41:44,00:41:45,"""but I wanna do them all myself."""
00:41:45,00:41:48,(audience laughing)
00:41:48,00:41:49,And he asked to keep them.
00:41:49,00:41:50,It was weird.
00:41:50,00:41:52,Yeah.
00:41:52,00:41:55,"He was, there were a lot of protests against this."
00:41:55,00:41:56,- Yeah.
00:41:56,00:41:58,"- I mean, various people saying this is not the way"
00:41:58,00:42:00,"to defeat HIV or AIDS, and also,"
00:42:00,00:42:04,"the Canadian Foreskin Awareness Project got in touch,"
00:42:04,00:42:06,"and they campaigned against him saying,"
00:42:06,00:42:09,"""No one on earth is more detrimental to Foreskin"
00:42:09,00:42:10,"""than Bill Gates."""
00:42:10,00:42:12,(audience laughing)
00:42:12,00:42:14,They called him Foreskin Enemy Number One.
00:42:14,00:42:15,(audience laughing)
00:42:15,00:42:16,"Yeah, it was incredible."
00:42:16,00:42:19,Their leader is a charismatic man called Glenn Callender.
00:42:19,00:42:21,"He challenged Bill Gates, right,"
00:42:21,00:42:23,'cause Bill Gates was paying for this thing.
00:42:23,00:42:25,"He said, ""If you put Bill Gates in a four-by-four"
00:42:25,00:42:29,"""meter room with me and my Foreskin for exactly 44 minutes,"
00:42:29,00:42:32,"""he will emerge convinced that the circumcision is wrong."""
00:42:32,00:42:34,"- I would like to see him put in a room with him,"
00:42:34,00:42:36,but his Foreskin isn't in that room.
00:42:36,00:42:37,(audience laughing)
00:42:37,00:42:38,How do you do that?
00:42:38,00:42:40,(audience laughing)
00:42:40,00:42:42,Have to be through a letterbox or something.
00:42:42,00:42:43,- Yeah.
00:42:43,00:42:44,- Wow.
00:42:44,00:42:44,"- Anyway, he's a hero."
00:42:44,00:42:45,- Yeah.
00:42:45,00:42:46,- Foreskin Awareness Project.
00:42:46,00:42:47,"- No, you're aware."
00:42:47,00:42:48,- Yeah.
00:42:48,00:42:49,"- Yeah, I am aware."
00:42:49,00:42:52,"He was asked about the potato farms on Reddit,"
00:42:52,00:42:54,"'cause they said, ""Is this part of your climate push?"""
00:42:54,00:42:56,"And he was saying, ""No, no, it's just part of investment,"""
00:42:56,00:42:59,'cause he's made so much money outside of Microsoft.
00:42:59,00:43:01,"Microsoft is obviously a big part of his wealth,"
00:43:01,00:43:03,"but a huge amount really is the other investments,"
00:43:03,00:43:05,"and it's someone else who does the investing for him,"
00:43:05,00:43:08,"so he has what he calls the Gateskeeper,"
00:43:08,00:43:09,who is someone--
00:43:09,00:43:10,- Brilliant.
00:43:10,00:43:15,"- Yeah, who turned, so there was $5 billion that he had,"
00:43:15,00:43:18,which turned it to $82 billion in the time
00:43:18,00:43:20,that this guy has made investments.
00:43:20,00:43:22,So all these different companies and stuff.
00:43:22,00:43:24,"- Easier, isn't it, when you're starting with $5 billion?"
00:43:24,00:43:25,Let's face it.
00:43:25,00:43:25,(audience laughing)
00:43:25,00:43:27,"- Yeah, that's true."
00:43:27,00:43:29,"His farm is 100 Circles Farm,"
00:43:29,00:43:31,"or one of the farms that he has is 100 Circles Farm,"
00:43:31,00:43:34,I think is the one that supplies McDonald's.
00:43:34,00:43:36,"And it's really cool in America, we don't have this,"
00:43:36,00:43:38,"but when you look at America from above,"
00:43:38,00:43:41,"from the ISS, in fact, the farms are all circles, aren't they?"
00:43:41,00:43:45,"In that particular, I think it's like a Great Plains area,"
00:43:45,00:43:47,then it's perfect circles.
00:43:47,00:43:49,"It looks like giant crop circles,"
00:43:49,00:43:53,"and it's just completely transformed American farming,"
00:43:53,00:43:54,"I think, when it happened."
00:43:54,00:43:55,"It's basically center pivot irrigation,"
00:43:55,00:43:58,which is like when you get one of those things
00:43:58,00:44:00,"in your garden that spins around in a tiny garden,"
00:44:00,00:44:03,"it's like a giant, giant version of that."
00:44:03,00:44:05,"And yeah, it basically transformed"
00:44:05,00:44:09,"a completely unfertil, useless bit of land into McDonald's."
00:44:09,00:44:11,- It is amazing when you fly over it.
00:44:11,00:44:13,"And they reckon that, okay,"
00:44:13,00:44:14,"that it's not the climate change thing,"
00:44:14,00:44:16,but he is saying that he's financing them
00:44:16,00:44:18,"to find more productive seeds,"
00:44:18,00:44:21,and try and improve agriculture
00:44:21,00:44:22,to maybe help people to farm in Africa.
00:44:22,00:44:24,That's one of his excuses.
00:44:24,00:44:25,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:44:25,00:44:27,Do you know this isn't the first time
00:44:27,00:44:28,that he's worked with French fries?
00:44:28,00:44:29,- Okay.
00:44:29,00:44:33,"- In the '90s, he, do you remember Microsoft?"
00:44:33,00:44:35,"Bob, the little system."
00:44:35,00:44:36,"- Oh, yeah."
00:44:36,00:44:38,- Bob was a disaster of a product.
00:44:38,00:44:39,It was meant to be something
00:44:39,00:44:42,"that hand walked you through every single moment,"
00:44:42,00:44:44,and Clippy was invented for it.
00:44:44,00:44:46,"- Was it like, it was like a room or something,"
00:44:46,00:44:47,"and you clicked on a little bit,"
00:44:47,00:44:49,"and it would take you to the word process,"
00:44:49,00:44:50,and you click there and it takes you somewhere else.
00:44:50,00:44:51,Is that right?
00:44:51,00:44:53,"- Exactly, and there was a dog called Rover,"
00:44:53,00:44:55,and there was Comic Sans was created for it.
00:44:55,00:44:57,We've mentioned it on the podcast before.
00:44:57,00:44:58,- This is actually giving me no impression
00:44:58,00:45:01,"of exactly what it was, but--"
00:45:01,00:45:03,- It was just a very easy way
00:45:03,00:45:05,"to navigate basically Microsoft Windows,"
00:45:05,00:45:07,"and the leaders on that project,"
00:45:07,00:45:09,"on that failed project,"
00:45:09,00:45:12,was two people called French and Fries.
00:45:12,00:45:13,- No.
00:45:13,00:45:14,"- Oh, yeah."
00:45:14,00:45:17,"So Melinda French, who then became Melinda Gates,"
00:45:17,00:45:20,"his now ex-wife, and Karen Fries,"
00:45:20,00:45:22,"who was the leader on the project,"
00:45:22,00:45:24,"and yeah, so yeah, it's really cool."
00:45:24,00:45:26,- Do we know if that's what inspired him
00:45:26,00:45:29,to do the whole McDonald's thing 40 years later?
00:45:29,00:45:30,"- He's not commented, no."
00:45:30,00:45:33,"You can do, when you've got Gates money,"
00:45:33,00:45:34,you can do whatever weird shit you like.
00:45:34,00:45:37,"So in 2016, he offered 100,000 chickens"
00:45:37,00:45:39,"to various countries, including Bolivia,"
00:45:39,00:45:43,and he got a rare refusal.
00:45:43,00:45:45,"- Ouch. - Yeah, Bolivia said,"
00:45:45,00:45:47,we breed 195 million chickens a year.
00:45:47,00:45:49,"We do not need a share of 100,000 chickens"
00:45:49,00:45:51,that Bill Gates is providing us.
00:45:51,00:45:52,This is incredibly patronizing.
00:45:52,00:45:53,- I don't know.
00:45:53,00:45:55,"That's kind of locking the gift chicken in the mouth,"
00:45:55,00:45:56,isn't it?
00:45:56,00:45:58,"- Well, you know, I kind of understand."
00:45:58,00:46:01,"If you've got that many chickens already, it feels like."
00:46:01,00:46:03,"- Yeah, okay, I want to have a chicken."
00:46:03,00:46:06,"Has anyone seen, this is about Microsoft,"
00:46:06,00:46:08,"and it's something that our colleague,"
00:46:08,00:46:09,"Alex, showed me recently,"
00:46:09,00:46:12,"but if you have an hour and you're,"
00:46:12,00:46:14,so you've never been more bored in your life
00:46:14,00:46:16,"and you've watched everything else on television,"
00:46:16,00:46:20,it's the Windows 95 instructional video.
00:46:20,00:46:21,Have you seen this? It's a sitcom.
00:46:21,00:46:23,"- Oh, it's a sitcom, really?"
00:46:23,00:46:26,"- But the Microsoft guys wrote it,"
00:46:26,00:46:28,"and it stars at the height,"
00:46:28,00:46:30,"as their fame was just starting,"
00:46:30,00:46:31,Jennifer Aniston and Matthew Perry.
00:46:31,00:46:32,- No.
00:46:32,00:46:34,"- Basically, as Rachel and Chandler,"
00:46:34,00:46:37,it's like the most excruciating hour of your life.
00:46:37,00:46:40,"Well, to be fair, the second half hour"
00:46:40,00:46:41,is just like instructions for how to use it.
00:46:41,00:46:43,The first half hour is a script
00:46:43,00:46:46,that really makes your genitals shrivel back up
00:46:46,00:46:48,inside yourself as you're watching.
00:46:48,00:46:52,"It's, I mean, there's some quite sleazy moments."
00:46:52,00:46:54,"Well, quite a lot of people pervy on Rachel."
00:46:54,00:46:56,There's a classic line from Chandler.
00:46:56,00:46:57,"They're ordering Chinese food,"
00:46:57,00:46:59,and someone suggests they order Mushu pork.
00:46:59,00:47:01,"Chandler says, ""You know what's interesting"
00:47:01,00:47:02,"""about Mushu pork?"
00:47:02,00:47:04,"""It's only good when it's together."""
00:47:04,00:47:06,"'Cause moo, not good."
00:47:06,00:47:08,"And shoo, definitely not good."
00:47:08,00:47:10,"But Mushu, that's good."
00:47:10,00:47:12,(laughing)
00:47:12,00:47:14,"- You made Dan laugh there, or something?"
00:47:14,00:47:16,(laughing)
00:47:16,00:47:17,"- I think it's on your level, actually."
00:47:17,00:47:18,- You might really like it.
00:47:18,00:47:20,- Classic Chandler.
00:47:20,00:47:23,(laughing)
00:47:23,00:47:24,- It's pretty painful stuff.
00:47:24,00:47:25,"- Wow, never heard of that."
00:47:25,00:47:27,"He was in ""Frasier"" as well."
00:47:27,00:47:28,- Was he?
00:47:28,00:47:30,- The second bit huge '90s sitcom.
00:47:30,00:47:31,He's apparently ruined.
00:47:31,00:47:33,(laughing)
00:47:33,00:47:34,- What we talked about on the episode was your--
00:47:34,00:47:37,"- But I don't think we mentioned that on the episode,"
00:47:37,00:47:38,"actually, yeah, and he was like,"
00:47:38,00:47:40,"was he a fan of ""Frasier"" or something?"
00:47:40,00:47:43,"- He's a fan, and he turns up to do an interview with ""Frasier"","
00:47:43,00:47:46,"but then people just call into the ""Frasier"" crane show"
00:47:46,00:47:49,asking for technical support with Microsoft products.
00:47:49,00:47:50,"It's pretty funny, actually."
00:47:50,00:47:52,"- He did do that once, didn't he, in 1989,"
00:47:52,00:47:54,"when Microsoft, they weren't massive,"
00:47:54,00:47:56,but they was getting pretty big.
00:47:56,00:47:58,And he was quite famous at that time.
00:47:58,00:48:01,"He walked into a support facility,"
00:48:01,00:48:03,"and he just sat down, put the headphones on,"
00:48:03,00:48:05,"answered a call, ""Hi, this is William."
00:48:05,00:48:06,"""How can I help you?"""
00:48:06,00:48:09,"And sure enough, he managed to fix the problem"
00:48:09,00:48:11,'cause he's Bill Gates.
00:48:11,00:48:14,"And this is on a blog on the company's website,"
00:48:14,00:48:17,"so, you know, but apparently he was so good"
00:48:17,00:48:19,"that when the customer called back later,"
00:48:19,00:48:21,"they said, ""I'd like to speak to that nice man"
00:48:21,00:48:24,"""called William, who straightened it all out."""
00:48:24,00:48:26,"- Well, why were they calling back?"
00:48:26,00:48:29,(audience laughing)
00:48:29,00:48:33,- That's an excellent question.
00:48:33,00:48:35,"- He stood out from a really early age,"
00:48:35,00:48:38,"his abilities, coding abilities."
00:48:38,00:48:39,"Like, he was a super smart guy."
00:48:39,00:48:42,"People often point out that he didn't get a university degree,"
00:48:42,00:48:45,"so hope for everyone, but he did go to Harvard"
00:48:45,00:48:48,and was basically too smart to bother finishing
00:48:48,00:48:49,'cause he was starting to build his own company.
00:48:49,00:48:51,"But when he was at school,"
00:48:51,00:48:53,he went to one of the only schools in the area
00:48:53,00:48:55,"which had its own computer, one computer."
00:48:55,00:48:59,"And the teacher spotted he was super good at coding,"
00:48:59,00:49:01,and so they asked him to write the school's computer program
00:49:01,00:49:03,to schedule all the students' classes
00:49:03,00:49:05,and put them all in the right classes.
00:49:05,00:49:05,- Wow.
00:49:05,00:49:08,"- And so he modified, this is him age 15 or whatever,"
00:49:08,00:49:10,maybe a precious thing's to come.
00:49:10,00:49:13,He modified the code in order that he was placed in classes
00:49:13,00:49:16,with a disproportionate number of interesting girls.
00:49:16,00:49:17,(audience laughing)
00:49:17,00:49:19,- Feels like interesting's not being used
00:49:19,00:49:20,in its traditional sense though.
00:49:20,00:49:22,(audience laughing)
00:49:22,00:49:22,Wow.
00:49:22,00:49:26,"Actually, another, the school that just had one computer,"
00:49:26,00:49:28,"another kid once asked,"
00:49:28,00:49:30,"sort of tried to kick him off the computer,"
00:49:30,00:49:32,"and he said, ""Okay, you can have it in 15 minutes."""
00:49:32,00:49:34,(audience laughing)
00:49:34,00:49:35,"- It's a keys joke, isn't it?"
00:49:35,00:49:36,- It's a keys joke.
00:49:36,00:49:38,- It's good.
00:49:38,00:49:40,"- You know, Microsoft Minesweeper,"
00:49:40,00:49:41,any Minesweeper fans in?
00:49:41,00:49:42,- Oh yeah.
00:49:42,00:49:43,- Any wasted hours?
00:49:43,00:49:44,- Yeah.
00:49:44,00:49:46,- Minesweeper crew are in.
00:49:46,00:49:48,"He, it was put on Windows in 1990"
00:49:48,00:49:50,and everyone at Microsoft was addicted to it.
00:49:50,00:49:52,Everyone loved Minesweeper 'cause it's great.
00:49:52,00:49:55,"And he uninstalled it from his computer,"
00:49:55,00:49:58,but he was so addicted that he would sneak into
00:49:58,00:50:00,the vice president's office after work.
00:50:00,00:50:01,He was so addicted.
00:50:01,00:50:02,He had the company record.
00:50:02,00:50:03,"He could do the beginner mode,"
00:50:03,00:50:04,"you know, it was a little like 10 by 10."
00:50:04,00:50:05,- Oh yeah.
00:50:05,00:50:07,- Beginner mode in five seconds.
00:50:07,00:50:08,- Can't you just luckily press someone
00:50:08,00:50:10,"and they all just kind of,"
00:50:10,00:50:12,just luckily is in the right place.
00:50:12,00:50:13,Occasionally you can do that.
00:50:13,00:50:14,I think if you get lucky.
00:50:14,00:50:15,- Five seconds is pretty good.
00:50:15,00:50:16,- Five seconds is amazing.
00:50:16,00:50:19,- But the firm's product manager was Bruce Ryan
00:50:19,00:50:20,"and he wrote a computer script,"
00:50:20,00:50:22,which could do it in four seconds.
00:50:22,00:50:24,And Bill Gates is not a good loser
00:50:24,00:50:25,"because when that happened,"
00:50:25,00:50:27,"he sent out an email to all the staff saying,"
00:50:27,00:50:29,"""When machines can do things faster than people,"
00:50:29,00:50:31,"""how can we retain our human dignity?"""
00:50:31,00:50:32,(audience laughing)
00:50:32,00:50:35,- Do you know he's only got one scientific paper
00:50:35,00:50:38,"that is published under his name, Bill Gates."
00:50:38,00:50:43,And it's a possible solution to a mathematical problem
00:50:43,00:50:45,about flipping pancakes.
00:50:45,00:50:46,"- Tell us more, Dan."
00:50:46,00:50:47,- Well.
00:50:47,00:50:49,- 'Cause this is quite complicated.
00:50:49,00:50:51,- It's so complicated that I was hoping
00:50:51,00:50:53,to just lob it your way and then bring it back.
00:50:53,00:50:56,"But basically it is a mathematical problem,"
00:50:56,00:50:59,which is very intense and it involves
00:50:59,00:51:00,how can you flip a number of things
00:51:00,00:51:01,that are out of order and make them flip.
00:51:01,00:51:04,"- Yeah, so if you have a big pile of pancakes,"
00:51:04,00:51:05,"they're all different sizes,"
00:51:05,00:51:08,and you can put your spatula under any one of them
00:51:08,00:51:09,and turn them upside down.
00:51:09,00:51:12,"How many times can you do that so that when you're finished,"
00:51:12,00:51:14,they start with the biggest one
00:51:14,00:51:15,and they end with the smallest one?
00:51:15,00:51:16,- Yeah.
00:51:16,00:51:18,- Okay. - And why are you doing this?
00:51:18,00:51:20,(audience laughing)
00:51:20,00:51:22,"- I'll send that back over to you, Dan."
00:51:22,00:51:22,- Yeah.
00:51:22,00:51:23,(audience laughing)
00:51:23,00:51:25,- Are they sweet or savory?
00:51:25,00:51:26,(audience laughing)
00:51:26,00:51:28,"- Sorry, back to James for that one."
00:51:28,00:51:29,(audience laughing)
00:51:29,00:51:30,- There is one version that they worked on
00:51:30,00:51:33,"called the burnt pancake problem,"
00:51:33,00:51:35,"where, again, we don't know if they're savory or sweet,"
00:51:35,00:51:37,"but we know that on one side they're burnt,"
00:51:37,00:51:39,and apparently that makes a big difference
00:51:39,00:51:40,to the problem.
00:51:40,00:51:41,- It certainly does make a big difference.
00:51:41,00:51:42,(audience laughing)
00:51:42,00:51:43,"But not only are they the wrong size,"
00:51:43,00:51:44,they're now burnt on one side.
00:51:44,00:51:46,I'm contacting the kitchen.
00:51:46,00:51:48,"So he did this while he was at Harvard,"
00:51:48,00:51:50,"and the professor, he was one of the names"
00:51:50,00:51:51,"on the paper with a few other,"
00:51:51,00:51:53,and it was a couple years before the paper
00:51:53,00:51:54,was accepted and published.
00:51:54,00:51:56,"And he called Bill Gates, the professor,"
00:51:56,00:51:59,"and he said, ""Good news, our pancake flipping paper"
00:51:59,00:52:01,"""has been accepted and it's gonna be published."""
00:52:01,00:52:04,"And he said, ""Bill Gates seemed really disinterested"
00:52:04,00:52:06,"""in the fact that this was happening,"""
00:52:06,00:52:09,and that he was now working in a company in New Mexico
00:52:09,00:52:12,that was writing code for microprocessors.
00:52:12,00:52:14,"And the professor said, ""I remember thinking,"
00:52:14,00:52:16,"""ah, such a brilliant kid, what a waste."""
00:52:16,00:52:20,(audience laughing)
00:52:20,00:52:21,That's so good.
00:52:21,00:52:23,"We're gonna have to wrap up and it's like, guys."
00:52:23,00:52:25,- Can I just study about his house quickly?
00:52:25,00:52:26,- Yes.
00:52:26,00:52:28,- Known as Zanadu 2.0.
00:52:28,00:52:30,"- Oh, yes, it's a semi, isn't it?"
00:52:30,00:52:32,"Semi detached, three bed."
00:52:32,00:52:33,"Yeah, it's nice."
00:52:33,00:52:33,- Very humble.
00:52:33,00:52:35,"It's a shared garden, one of those."
00:52:35,00:52:37,Situations.
00:52:37,00:52:39,"It's got, I just don't understand this,"
00:52:39,00:52:43,"it's got seven bedrooms and by one count,"
00:52:43,00:52:47,"18.75 bathrooms and by another count, 24 bathrooms."
00:52:47,00:52:50,"It also has, well, according to a book hero in the '90s,"
00:52:50,00:52:54,"one of the elements of which was describing his ideal home,"
00:52:54,00:52:58,it has guests get a badge when they enter that they wear
00:52:58,00:53:00,and they put in their temperature
00:53:00,00:53:02,and lighting preferences on their badge.
00:53:02,00:53:04,"And then whenever you walk into a new room,"
00:53:04,00:53:07,it automatically adjusts the temperature and lighting.
00:53:07,00:53:08,And I don't know what it does
00:53:08,00:53:10,if two of you walk into the room at the same time.
00:53:10,00:53:12,"- That is, yeah."
00:53:12,00:53:12,"- That's, oh my God."
00:53:12,00:53:14,- I would hack the badges to murder people
00:53:14,00:53:15,and that would be my plot.
00:53:15,00:53:16,- What?
00:53:16,00:53:17,- Why?
00:53:17,00:53:18,- Why?
00:53:18,00:53:19,(audience laughing)
00:53:19,00:53:21,"- Who likes having guests, really?"
00:53:21,00:53:24,(audience laughing)
00:53:24,00:53:26,"I'd send it to 1,000 degrees."
00:53:26,00:53:29,(audience laughing)
00:53:29,00:53:30,- Yeah.
00:53:30,00:53:31,"- A little paperclip turns up,"
00:53:31,00:53:33,"it looks like you're trying to kill, kill, kill."
00:53:33,00:53:36,(audience laughing)
00:53:36,00:53:40,"Okay, that is it."
00:53:40,00:53:41,That is all of our facts.
00:53:41,00:53:42,Thank you.
00:53:42,00:53:43,(audience cheering)
00:53:43,00:53:45,"Thank you so much, thank you."
00:53:45,00:53:48,(audience applauding)
00:53:48,00:53:53,"Thank you, guys."
00:53:53,00:53:54,That is it.
00:53:54,00:53:55,That is all of our facts.
