00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580
 (upbeat music)

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.500
 (speaking in foreign language)

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:09.080
 (upbeat music)

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:16.300
 - Hello and welcome to another episode

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:19.860
 of "No Such Thing as a Fish," a weekly podcast,

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:23.420
 this week coming to you live from the London Palladium.

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:26.420
 (audience cheering)

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:29.420
 (audience cheering)

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:34.500
 Tonight is also a very special episode for us.

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.640
 It is our 400th episode of "Gang!"

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:40.640
 (audience cheering)

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:44.660
 My name is Dan Shriver, I'm sitting here

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:47.700
 with Anna Tyshinski, Andrew Huntamari, and James Harkin.

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.900
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:52.880
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days.

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:55.860
 And in a particular order, here we go.

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.300
 Starting with fact number one, and that is Anna.

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:02.860
 - My fact this week is that there's a 300 square miles

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:05.980
 section of America where all microwaves

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:08.180
 have to be kept in cages.

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:10.460
 (audience laughing)

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:13.580
 - Are they living microwaves?

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:15.100
 They're scary, like teethy.

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:17.980
 - Violent, yes, some kryptonite was spilled on them

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:21.260
 in the '60s and haven't been able to keep control of them.

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.500
 No, this is, they're kept in specific cages.

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:25.380
 I have misled you there slightly.

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.400
 They have to be kept in faraday cages,

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:29.760
 and that's 'cause it's in the quiet zone.

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:31.940
 So this is, the whole quiet zone

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:34.540
 is actually about 13,000 square miles.

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:36.460
 And across that, radio transmissions

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:38.260
 and all electromagnetic transmissions

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.080
 are really restricted.

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:42.940
 And within this little 300 square mile section,

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:45.640
 which is right next to this Green Bank Observatory,

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:47.460
 which is a few giant telescopes,

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:48.460
 which are really, really important

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:51.240
 for like seeing things from outer space,

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.660
 they need to have just no interruption.

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:56.180
 And that means no waves of any sort.

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:58.640
 And that includes, if you're microwaving a burger

00:01:58.640 --> 00:01:59.940
 at two in the morning,

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:02.420
 that could convince them there's alien life out there.

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:04.420
 So it's gotta go in a faraday cage.

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:06.060
 - I've had a few burgers at two in the morning

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.260
 that would convince me there's alien life out there.

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:09.580
 (audience laughing)

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:12.060
 It is because of this observatory,

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.100
 although it also happens to be

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:15.980
 where the National Security Agency

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:18.140
 has one of its listening stations.

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:19.680
 - Oh. - Which also happens

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:20.980
 to be in the same area.

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:22.340
 - Wait, so what are they listening to?

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:23.300
 Are they listening to?

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:25.260
 - Well, they might need a lot of quiet,

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:26.420
 so they can basically,

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:28.940
 they're listening to any foreign transmissions

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:31.620
 that come into the eastern side of the United States.

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:32.580
 - Right. - So it helps them

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:33.780
 to be a bit quiet as well.

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:35.140
 - Interesting. - Wow.

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:36.900
 - It's for anyone who wants peace and quiet, really.

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:37.740
 - Yeah.

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:40.500
 - The NSA, these telescope guys,

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.620
 weird conspiracy theorists, quite a lot of them there.

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:44.580
 - I know, it's a big mix of people, isn't it?

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:45.420
 - Yeah. - Yeah.

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:46.340
 - Conspiracy theorists, you've got your people

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:48.300
 who believe that they suffer from a disease,

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:50.100
 whereby Wi-Fi interferes with them,

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:52.500
 and they sometimes have to sleep in boxes

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:53.340
 to get away from it.

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:55.300
 - They should come to the QI office.

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:56.140
 (audience laughs)

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:58.460
 - Oh, that was a joke about how shit our Wi-Fi is.

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:59.300
 (audience laughs)

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:01.500
 - It was, we had a few of the elves in the audience,

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:02.700
 and they would have loved that joke.

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:05.500
 - Yeah, also we invited our IT guy tonight.

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:06.740
 I know he's really shit.

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:08.140
 (audience laughs)

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:08.980
 Sorry, buddy.

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:10.300
 - It sounds just incredible.

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:12.220
 The list of restrictions there are,

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:13.300
 all because of this telescope.

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:15.220
 So there are various things that aren't allowed.

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:17.580
 You know, like lots of stuff about Wi-Fi

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:19.200
 is technically banned.

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:22.140
 Petrol-driven vehicles are not allowed

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:24.220
 because they have spark plugs.

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:26.100
 So if you fire them up, that might do something.

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:27.380
 - I thought this was so interesting.

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:30.220
 I did not know this, that if you are prone

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:31.980
 to sort of wearing tinfoil hats or whatever,

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:33.500
 and waves getting into your brain,

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:35.260
 petrol cars, terrible.

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:36.980
 Diesel cars, fine.

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:38.380
 Diesel is just compressed.

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:40.260
 I guess I never properly understood the difference.

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:41.420
 Just really, really compressed

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:42.940
 until it's hot enough to ignite.

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:44.980
 Whereas petrol, you know, it needs a spark,

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:46.380
 and that's giving off waves,

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:47.860
 and that's fucking with your brain.

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:50.540
 (audience laughs)

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:53.300
 - It's not, I just want to clarify, it's not.

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:55.420
 - And the members of the public who live there,

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:57.460
 so it's a very small population there.

00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:59.740
 It's under 200 people that live there.

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:00.780
 - This is just in the tiny inner bit.

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:02.900
 - In the tiny inner bit, yeah.

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:04.340
 But they take it really seriously

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:06.460
 about how they have to make sure

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:09.700
 that nothing is messing with this telescope,

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:11.980
 to the point where there's almost citizen police officers

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:14.380
 that go around driving in their car,

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:17.660
 just looking every day for any kind of Wi-Fi signal,

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:20.060
 or any, there was a guy called Wesley Sizemore,

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:21.820
 and he used to just knock on doors,

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:24.980
 and just go and walk in and go unplug your microwave,

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:26.620
 turn your Wi-Fi off.

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:30.100
 Yeah, he once, amazingly, tracked down the radio frequency

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:34.620
 interference of a faulty electric blanket in someone's house.

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:35.460
 - Wow.

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:36.460
 - And he went into their house,

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:38.660
 and he confiscated it off them.

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:41.300
 - Just woke up a poor granny at three in the morning,

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:43.020
 and she got her awake.

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:44.900
 - There's a woman called Dr. Karen O'Neill,

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:46.380
 who works at the observatory,

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:48.580
 and she says that she has members of her family

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:49.820
 who never visit them,

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:52.700
 because the lack of Wi-Fi stresses out the teenagers.

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:53.980
 (audience laughing)

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:56.060
 - Yeah, that's why they're not getting visits.

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:57.620
 I'm so sorry, we'd love to,

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:59.780
 but the teenagers have to have their Wi-Fi.

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:02.260
 - Now, I think a lot of you are probably thinking like,

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:04.820
 okay, you have to put the microwave in a Faraday cage.

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:06.300
 The first thing I thought was,

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:07.980
 isn't a microwave a Faraday cage?

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:08.820
 - Yeah.

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:11.140
 - I thought that was kind of the whole point of microwaves,

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:14.980
 but what it is, is microwaves do have Faraday cages in them,

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:16.220
 but they often leak.

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:17.060
 - Yeah.

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:19.740
 - Okay, so you can test if you have a leaky microwave,

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:21.380
 so I tried this today at home.

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:23.220
 I put my phone into the microwave

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:25.100
 and got my wife to call me,

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:27.220
 and I still got the call.

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:28.060
 - What?

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:29.420
 - And I tried the one backstage,

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:30.460
 we have a microwave backstage,

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:31.500
 and I put my phone in there,

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:32.580
 and one of the elves called me,

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:33.420
 and I didn't get it,

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:35.180
 so this one is a proper Faraday cage,

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:36.820
 but my one at home is a leaky one.

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:40.860
 - So, hang on, doesn't that break the microwave?

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:42.140
 - No, it don't turn it on.

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:44.980
 (audience laughing)

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:46.660
 - Well, just, well, don't.

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:50.660
 - We should say, in case anyone else was confused.

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:52.340
 - Dinner tonight in the Harkin house.

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:54.500
 (audience laughing)

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:56.340
 - Cooked apple.

00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:57.720
 - Oh, very nice.

00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:00.300
 (audience laughing)

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:02.940
 - There's a guy who has a van called Emit,

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:05.940
 which is the electromagnetic interference tracking truck,

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:07.860
 which is a very forced acronym.

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:09.700
 But yeah, that might be who you were talking about,

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:10.980
 who drives around like the signals.

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:13.140
 It's got 17 antennae on it.

00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:15.140
 - Yeah, well this might be the new guy,

00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:16.700
 but there's a new sheriff in town.

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:17.540
 (audience laughing)

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:19.380
 - Yeah, 'cause yeah, Sizemore is retired,

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:20.540
 so there's a new guy who goes,

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:21.820
 and you can see photos,

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:24.060
 and it is like in the X-Files,

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:27.020
 that van that's just full of computers and stuff.

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:29.140
 Yeah, it's amazing, and they all think

00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:30.660
 that it's part of the observatory

00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:32.760
 that is messing with their lives in various different ways,

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:34.860
 so there was a mother who called in

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:37.940
 saying that she was getting interference on her TV

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:39.020
 because of the telescope,

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:41.740
 so it just said N-R-A-O on her TV,

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:44.060
 and she was like, "You guys are breaking my TV."

00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:45.020
 So when someone came round,

00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:47.860
 it turned out that that acronym N-R-A-O

00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:50.580
 stood for not rated adults only,

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:54.580
 and it was because her son was trying to watch porn.

00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:56.760
 (audience laughing)

00:06:56.760 --> 00:06:58.380
 - Oh my God.

00:06:58.380 --> 00:07:00.380
 - What a weird, people get imprisoned, I wonder.

00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:02.220
 I mean, I know they don't, you get a small fine,

00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:03.980
 but it's a strange crime to have done.

00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:06.220
 - Yeah, it's a $50 fine, isn't it?

00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:08.180
 But the truth is that due to the fact

00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:09.700
 that no one has any money anymore,

00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:11.620
 the police are not spending the time

00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:14.220
 going around trying to prosecute people for this,

00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:17.100
 and that means that actually most of the places

00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:20.460
 in that town now have Wi-Fi and have microwaves

00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:22.660
 'cause they know that no one's gonna do anything,

00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:24.660
 and the observatory have kind of gone,

00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:25.940
 "Well fine, we'll deal with it,

00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:27.420
 "we'll work out what the background is,

00:07:27.420 --> 00:07:28.800
 "and we'll kind of deal with that."

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:31.500
 The conspiracy theories who think it's fucking with their heads,

00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:32.580
 they are not happy.

00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:34.220
 - Right, of course.

00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:36.340
 - No, they're the ones who are really upset about it.

00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:37.860
 - Yeah. - Wow.

00:07:37.860 --> 00:07:38.700
 - Yeah.

00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:42.140
 - One ski resort, which they made an exception for,

00:07:42.140 --> 00:07:45.620
 which seems nice, always nice to let the old wealthy skiers

00:07:45.620 --> 00:07:48.540
 have a way around the rules that bind everyone else,

00:07:48.540 --> 00:07:50.460
 but that's Snowshoe Mountain,

00:07:50.460 --> 00:07:54.460
 and it advertises itself as an oasis of cellular activity

00:07:54.460 --> 00:07:56.420
 in an otherwise total dead zone,

00:07:56.420 --> 00:08:00.420
 and they got one of the, you know,

00:08:00.420 --> 00:08:03.700
 cell companies to wire it up specifically

00:08:03.700 --> 00:08:06.660
 so that it wouldn't really radiate any waves,

00:08:06.660 --> 00:08:09.140
 but that you can still call someone on the slopes and say,

00:08:09.140 --> 00:08:10.460
 "I've lost." - But that's really,

00:08:10.460 --> 00:08:11.900
 it's really annoying, 'cause you will have,

00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:14.660
 I guess, reception at the start of the run,

00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:16.460
 but you're like, "Yeah, yeah, this run's going really well,

00:08:16.460 --> 00:08:18.740
 "I'm just skiing down, hello, hello,"

00:08:18.740 --> 00:08:20.420
 as you get further and further away.

00:08:20.420 --> 00:08:21.620
 - I don't think it runs out, does it?

00:08:21.620 --> 00:08:23.180
 They don't just put it on the peaks,

00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:24.220
 that would be terrifying.

00:08:24.220 --> 00:08:26.980
 - But I guess also once you get it in the ski resorts,

00:08:26.980 --> 00:08:28.660
 then everyone's gonna want it, right?

00:08:28.660 --> 00:08:29.780
 It's a slippery slope.

00:08:29.780 --> 00:08:30.620
 - Oh my God.

00:08:30.620 --> 00:08:33.780
 (audience laughing)

00:08:33.780 --> 00:08:36.660
 - Yeah, so that whole area, you've got the ski slope,

00:08:36.660 --> 00:08:40.180
 you've got the neo-Nazi area,

00:08:40.180 --> 00:08:42.340
 which is quite a popular area there.

00:08:42.340 --> 00:08:43.660
 Yeah, yeah, there's a lot of neo-Nazis,

00:08:43.660 --> 00:08:45.460
 'cause basically, as we were saying before,

00:08:45.460 --> 00:08:47.060
 it's kind of like people are going there

00:08:47.060 --> 00:08:48.980
 for either to get away from technology,

00:08:48.980 --> 00:08:51.780
 or they're going to a place where they can be a prepper

00:08:51.780 --> 00:08:53.860
 and effectively get away from all this stuff

00:08:53.860 --> 00:08:55.460
 and just live in isolation.

00:08:55.460 --> 00:08:57.300
 So you've got the preppers, you've got the neo-Nazis,

00:08:57.300 --> 00:09:00.100
 you've got the slopes. - Sorry, why are the neo-Nazis

00:09:00.100 --> 00:09:01.420
 being dumped in with the preppers

00:09:01.420 --> 00:09:02.740
 and the people who are afraid of technology?

00:09:02.740 --> 00:09:03.980
 I know the people who are afraid of technology

00:09:03.980 --> 00:09:06.420
 are a bit silly, and the preppers are a bit nuts, but.

00:09:06.420 --> 00:09:07.260
 - And the ski slope is,

00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:08.740
 I'm just listing all the different communities.

00:09:08.740 --> 00:09:10.820
 - Why are the neo-Nazis there?

00:09:10.820 --> 00:09:12.340
 - Everyone's got to be somewhere.

00:09:12.340 --> 00:09:15.060
 (audience laughing)

00:09:15.060 --> 00:09:16.620
 - It's so nice to hear someone sticking up

00:09:16.620 --> 00:09:18.500
 for the neo-Nazis there, it's really good.

00:09:18.500 --> 00:09:19.340
 - I will not.

00:09:19.340 --> 00:09:23.060
 But my favorite one, just very quickly,

00:09:23.060 --> 00:09:26.300
 is the Gazuntai Institute is there as well,

00:09:26.300 --> 00:09:28.620
 which was set up by Patch Adams.

00:09:28.620 --> 00:09:30.260
 Do you remember the brilliant movie, Patch Adams?

00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:31.100
 - It was Rock Williams.

00:09:31.100 --> 00:09:32.820
 - Yeah, I've recognized that's a sentence

00:09:32.820 --> 00:09:34.780
 no one has ever said before, the brilliant movie.

00:09:34.780 --> 00:09:36.100
 - So was he a real person, Patch Adams?

00:09:36.100 --> 00:09:38.180
 - He's a real person, and he wanted to set up

00:09:38.180 --> 00:09:40.460
 a hospital where it would be, you didn't have to pay,

00:09:40.460 --> 00:09:43.340
 and they used humor instead of medicine.

00:09:43.340 --> 00:09:45.820
 (audience laughing)

00:09:45.820 --> 00:09:46.900
 And that's where that is as well.

00:09:46.900 --> 00:09:48.860
 - And they just read that laughter as the best medicine

00:09:48.860 --> 00:09:49.700
 and took it literally.

00:09:49.700 --> 00:09:50.860
 - Yeah, he's a brilliant--

00:09:50.860 --> 00:09:52.100
 - I have heard of him, actually,

00:09:52.100 --> 00:09:53.380
 is he the one who goes around

00:09:53.380 --> 00:09:55.740
 with the world's largest pair of underpants?

00:09:55.740 --> 00:09:56.580
 - That is him.

00:09:56.580 --> 00:09:57.420
 - That is him, right?

00:09:57.420 --> 00:09:58.260
 - Yes.

00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:00.180
 - And I think like the president of Costa Rica

00:10:00.180 --> 00:10:01.260
 and the president of Ecuador

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:03.580
 have been in this giant underpants or something.

00:10:03.580 --> 00:10:04.580
 - Yeah, you know him.

00:10:04.580 --> 00:10:06.900
 - I know, yeah, I remember him.

00:10:06.900 --> 00:10:07.940
 - Patch Adams, a legend.

00:10:07.940 --> 00:10:09.260
 - You've seen the sequels.

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:12.060
 I don't think that was even in the film.

00:10:12.060 --> 00:10:13.620
 - This telescope, just briefly,

00:10:13.620 --> 00:10:15.940
 the actual Green Bank telescope, it is unbelievable.

00:10:15.940 --> 00:10:20.140
 Okay, so I don't even really fully grasp this.

00:10:20.140 --> 00:10:23.500
 It can measure the energy from billions of miles away

00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:25.380
 equivalent to a single snowflake

00:10:25.380 --> 00:10:27.460
 falling onto the surface of the earth,

00:10:27.460 --> 00:10:28.860
 but at any normal distance.

00:10:28.860 --> 00:10:32.140
 - It must be tough when the ski season's up, yes.

00:10:32.140 --> 00:10:32.980
 - Oh my God!

00:10:32.980 --> 00:10:36.740
 - Yeah, the energy that they're looking for

00:10:36.740 --> 00:10:39.380
 is the energy from extremely distant stars like quasars,

00:10:39.380 --> 00:10:41.700
 which are very, very bright, but they're a long way away,

00:10:41.700 --> 00:10:44.500
 and they can pick up, the energy that they give off,

00:10:44.500 --> 00:10:45.740
 all that gets to us here,

00:10:45.740 --> 00:10:48.140
 is a billionth of a billionth of a millionth

00:10:48.140 --> 00:10:51.020
 of one watt per square meter,

00:10:51.020 --> 00:10:53.220
 which is why this telescope needs to be so enormous,

00:10:53.220 --> 00:10:56.580
 it's two acres, the dish in capacity, in area,

00:10:56.580 --> 00:10:58.100
 so that it can pick up those signals.

00:10:58.100 --> 00:11:00.260
 Tiny things, they say, if you're on Saturn,

00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:01.260
 if you find yourself on Saturn,

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:03.300
 and you put your phone on airplane mode,

00:11:03.300 --> 00:11:06.060
 they can still detect it from there.

00:11:06.060 --> 00:11:07.700
 - Wow, even on airplane mode?

00:11:07.700 --> 00:11:09.740
 - Even in airplane mode, so you can't get away with anything.

00:11:09.740 --> 00:11:12.460
 - I thought airplane mode was absolutely impregnable.

00:11:12.460 --> 00:11:13.300
 - I'm afraid not,

00:11:13.300 --> 00:11:15.020
 I'm afraid that's what the government wants you to believe.

00:11:15.020 --> 00:11:17.460
 - Oh my God, I have to go!

00:11:17.460 --> 00:11:20.020
 - How's anyone gonna give you a ring on Saturn?

00:11:20.020 --> 00:11:20.860
 - Hey.

00:11:20.860 --> 00:11:26.140
 - I reckon that's the last one of those I can get away with.

00:11:26.140 --> 00:11:27.340
 - Oh, I don't know.

00:11:27.340 --> 00:11:30.420
 - All I'm thinking is two, one, and I am.

00:11:30.420 --> 00:11:32.460
 Challenge accepted.

00:11:32.460 --> 00:11:34.300
 What a shame that that's such an amazing fact,

00:11:34.300 --> 00:11:36.060
 but the thing that sticks out for everyone

00:11:36.060 --> 00:11:38.980
 is airplane mode, you can still find us.

00:11:38.980 --> 00:11:40.900
 - That's the amazing bit, though.

00:11:40.900 --> 00:11:43.660
 And the Saturn bit, but largely the airplane mode bit,

00:11:43.660 --> 00:11:45.740
 'cause you're not supposed to be giving off anything.

00:11:45.740 --> 00:11:47.940
 And another cool thing about the telescope is that,

00:11:47.940 --> 00:11:50.260
 so it's made of the huge dish,

00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:51.820
 which receives all the radio waves,

00:11:51.820 --> 00:11:54.180
 it's made of loads and loads of little panels,

00:11:54.180 --> 00:11:56.860
 and it needs to be perfectly smooth.

00:11:56.860 --> 00:11:58.140
 And actually, over the years,

00:11:58.140 --> 00:11:59.580
 just the force of gravity

00:11:59.580 --> 00:12:02.140
 would very, very slightly deform the panels.

00:12:02.140 --> 00:12:05.620
 And so every panel has a tiny motor attached to it,

00:12:05.620 --> 00:12:08.260
 which senses, and as soon as it deforms by, you know,

00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:11.700
 a micrometer by the width of a couple of human hairs,

00:12:11.700 --> 00:12:14.100
 the motor senses it and adjusts the panel

00:12:14.100 --> 00:12:16.100
 to make it smooth again. - That's amazing.

00:12:16.100 --> 00:12:17.060
 - It's pretty good.

00:12:17.060 --> 00:12:19.500
 - Another person who had a telescope

00:12:19.500 --> 00:12:23.300
 that needed a lot of work on it was William Herschel.

00:12:23.300 --> 00:12:27.900
 He was a guy who discovered Uranus, and he was...

00:12:27.900 --> 00:12:29.460
 - No, yeah, come on. - No.

00:12:29.460 --> 00:12:30.780
 (audience laughs)

00:12:30.780 --> 00:12:31.620
 No, I'm with them.

00:12:31.620 --> 00:12:32.700
 Say the proper name.

00:12:32.700 --> 00:12:35.100
 (audience laughs)

00:12:35.100 --> 00:12:36.300
 - Herschel, is it?

00:12:36.300 --> 00:12:39.340
 (audience laughs)

00:12:39.340 --> 00:12:42.860
 So William Herschel, he discovered Uranus, or Uranus,

00:12:42.860 --> 00:12:46.700
 and he was really obsessed with his telescopes,

00:12:46.700 --> 00:12:49.820
 so much so that his sister, Caroline,

00:12:49.820 --> 00:12:53.620
 spent her whole life basically polishing his telescope.

00:12:53.620 --> 00:12:58.620
 And so now, I would accept Uranus, but come on.

00:12:58.620 --> 00:13:04.420
 And also, he was so obsessed with searching for the stars,

00:13:04.420 --> 00:13:08.020
 she had to feed him by putting food directly into his mouth.

00:13:08.020 --> 00:13:10.020
 - Wow. - 'Cause he was so on it.

00:13:10.020 --> 00:13:11.420
 And she's an amazing person.

00:13:11.420 --> 00:13:14.860
 She basically was in Hanover,

00:13:14.860 --> 00:13:16.380
 and then the French Army came in

00:13:16.380 --> 00:13:17.980
 and they kind of took over Hanover,

00:13:17.980 --> 00:13:21.940
 and then so William Herschel left there and came to the UK.

00:13:21.940 --> 00:13:25.300
 He became an organist, and then she came over

00:13:25.300 --> 00:13:27.220
 and he started giving her singing lessons,

00:13:27.220 --> 00:13:30.340
 and then before long, she was a superstar in Bath and Bristol.

00:13:30.340 --> 00:13:33.100
 She was singing five nights a week, she was massive,

00:13:33.100 --> 00:13:35.140
 but then when her brother wanted to become,

00:13:35.140 --> 00:13:38.020
 looking at the stars, she had to give it all up

00:13:38.020 --> 00:13:39.780
 to just polish his telescope.

00:13:39.780 --> 00:13:41.660
 - Wow. (audience laughs)

00:13:41.660 --> 00:13:43.820
 - And but then in the end, he died in the end,

00:13:43.820 --> 00:13:45.980
 and she took over his job,

00:13:45.980 --> 00:13:48.020
 and she became famous as a discoverer

00:13:48.020 --> 00:13:50.020
 of no fewer than eight comets.

00:13:50.020 --> 00:13:52.100
 And for her 96th birthday,

00:13:52.100 --> 00:13:54.060
 Honbo presented her with a gold medal

00:13:54.060 --> 00:13:55.900
 for science from the King of Prussia.

00:13:55.900 --> 00:13:57.100
 - Wow. - Wow.

00:13:57.100 --> 00:13:58.380
 - How did the brother die?

00:13:58.380 --> 00:14:00.780
 Did he die mysteriously as a result of having received

00:14:00.780 --> 00:14:02.620
 no food for several weeks?

00:14:02.620 --> 00:14:04.020
 (audience laughs)

00:14:04.020 --> 00:14:05.740
 - We need to move on to our next fact.

00:14:05.740 --> 00:14:09.100
 It is time for fact number two, and that is my fact.

00:14:09.100 --> 00:14:12.780
 My fact this week is that the musician Ray Charles,

00:14:12.780 --> 00:14:15.340
 who was blind, used to fly to gigs

00:14:15.340 --> 00:14:18.100
 because he thought it was safer than driving.

00:14:18.100 --> 00:14:22.460
 However, he also insisted on flying the plane himself.

00:14:22.460 --> 00:14:24.580
 (audience laughs)

00:14:24.580 --> 00:14:27.220
 This is an extraordinary claim,

00:14:27.220 --> 00:14:31.500
 and it's come up countless times from his friends,

00:14:31.500 --> 00:14:33.340
 from his biographers.

00:14:33.340 --> 00:14:36.140
 Supposedly, there was a plane that he used to,

00:14:36.140 --> 00:14:37.740
 that he owned, and he would charter,

00:14:37.740 --> 00:14:39.180
 and he would bring all his band on.

00:14:39.180 --> 00:14:41.100
 He had a few planes in his career,

00:14:41.100 --> 00:14:42.500
 and he used to have a pilot,

00:14:42.500 --> 00:14:44.980
 who was a friend of his called Tom McGarrity,

00:14:44.980 --> 00:14:48.420
 and when the plane had gone up and was at cruising level,

00:14:48.420 --> 00:14:51.060
 he would get really bored and needed to pass the time.

00:14:51.060 --> 00:14:54.680
 So there's reports of Ray Charles going into the cockpit,

00:14:54.680 --> 00:14:56.060
 sitting down at the controls,

00:14:56.060 --> 00:14:59.100
 and being handed over the controls from the pilot,

00:14:59.100 --> 00:15:01.540
 and just flying the plane there for hours.

00:15:01.540 --> 00:15:04.060
 There's even stories that maybe he landed the plane

00:15:04.060 --> 00:15:05.820
 once or twice himself.

00:15:05.820 --> 00:15:08.420
 - It's why they invented in-flight entertainment,

00:15:08.420 --> 00:15:10.060
 I think, isn't it?

00:15:10.060 --> 00:15:11.300
 - To keep Ray Charles.

00:15:11.300 --> 00:15:12.700
 - To save pilot's lives.

00:15:12.700 --> 00:15:14.540
 - Do you believe the stories, my question is that?

00:15:14.540 --> 00:15:15.380
 - Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:15:15.380 --> 00:15:16.220
 - You believe he landed the plane.

00:15:16.220 --> 00:15:17.460
 - No, I don't believe he landed it.

00:15:17.460 --> 00:15:20.660
 I do believe that he might have flown it.

00:15:20.660 --> 00:15:21.500
 - It's so funny.

00:15:21.500 --> 00:15:23.840
 - I mean, but I don't know enough about planes to know that,

00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:26.700
 but there's Bobby Womack, for example,

00:15:26.700 --> 00:15:28.540
 who didn't know that he would do that,

00:15:28.540 --> 00:15:30.020
 was just sitting on the plane,

00:15:30.020 --> 00:15:31.940
 and suddenly Ray Charles runs through the cockpit

00:15:31.940 --> 00:15:33.420
 and takes over it, and he's going,

00:15:33.420 --> 00:15:34.580
 "Is everyone cool with this?"

00:15:34.580 --> 00:15:36.820
 And they are like, "It's an incredible anecdote."

00:15:36.820 --> 00:15:38.820
 He says, "Oh, Jesus me, oh, dear Lord."

00:15:38.820 --> 00:15:40.380
 He started praying, Bobby Womack.

00:15:40.380 --> 00:15:41.780
 He said, "There's a blind man flying the plane.

00:15:41.780 --> 00:15:42.780
 "This is nonsense."

00:15:42.780 --> 00:15:44.660
 And the trumpet player of Ray Charles' band

00:15:44.660 --> 00:15:46.420
 just told him to relax and said,

00:15:46.420 --> 00:15:48.420
 "You don't need eyes to fly a plane."

00:15:48.420 --> 00:15:50.300
 Everyone was on a lot of heroin at this point,

00:15:50.300 --> 00:15:52.060
 obviously, by the way.

00:15:52.060 --> 00:15:53.060
 - Including Ray Charles.

00:15:53.060 --> 00:15:54.100
 - Including Ray Charles.

00:15:54.100 --> 00:15:56.100
 - Yeah, they got there really quick.

00:15:56.100 --> 00:15:57.380
 - Yeah.

00:15:57.380 --> 00:16:00.220
 - What I find is that the closer you get to rail Charles

00:16:00.220 --> 00:16:02.700
 for these anecdotes, the more it gets to,

00:16:02.700 --> 00:16:04.780
 less that he was flying or landing the plane,

00:16:04.780 --> 00:16:06.620
 and more that he knew how to do it,

00:16:06.620 --> 00:16:08.220
 but he didn't necessarily do it.

00:16:08.220 --> 00:16:09.060
 - Yes.

00:16:09.060 --> 00:16:09.900
 - So it's interesting.

00:16:09.900 --> 00:16:11.420
 - I don't know, if one of those inflatable things

00:16:11.420 --> 00:16:15.020
 can fly a plane, then I reckon Ray Charles can.

00:16:15.020 --> 00:16:16.820
 - Are you talking about the movie "Earth Plane"?

00:16:16.820 --> 00:16:17.660
 - Yeah.

00:16:17.660 --> 00:16:18.500
 (laughing)

00:16:18.500 --> 00:16:19.820
 - That documentary.

00:16:19.820 --> 00:16:21.380
 - That's pretty true to life, yeah.

00:16:21.380 --> 00:16:23.260
 - Yeah, and I read his autobiography

00:16:23.260 --> 00:16:24.380
 over the last couple of days.

00:16:24.380 --> 00:16:26.100
 He doesn't mention it in there,

00:16:26.100 --> 00:16:29.260
 but again, he does say that he would know how to do it.

00:16:29.260 --> 00:16:32.300
 If worse came to worst and everyone else on the plane died,

00:16:32.300 --> 00:16:34.420
 he would be able to land it without killing himself.

00:16:34.420 --> 00:16:35.540
 That's what his claim was.

00:16:35.540 --> 00:16:36.700
 - He feels like he's done it.

00:16:36.700 --> 00:16:37.740
 I mean, what else has he done?

00:16:37.740 --> 00:16:38.820
 Memorised it in a book.

00:16:38.820 --> 00:16:40.900
 I don't think anyone would say they knew how to fly a plane

00:16:40.900 --> 00:16:42.020
 if they'd memorised the text.

00:16:42.020 --> 00:16:43.620
 - Okay, can I tell you his technique

00:16:43.620 --> 00:16:45.580
 that he was gonna use then to land it?

00:16:45.580 --> 00:16:46.420
 - Oh, God.

00:16:46.420 --> 00:16:47.260
 - Oh, yeah, this is awesome, yeah, yeah.

00:16:47.260 --> 00:16:50.380
 - So his technique was that he was gonna get all the dials

00:16:50.380 --> 00:16:53.620
 'cause you need the dials to land, as well as your eyes.

00:16:53.620 --> 00:16:56.540
 But you need the dials and he was gonna smash all these dials

00:16:56.540 --> 00:16:58.940
 and he was gonna use his hand to feel

00:16:58.940 --> 00:17:01.020
 the way that the dials are moving all the time.

00:17:01.020 --> 00:17:03.220
 - Well, no, no, 'cause there's one specific dial.

00:17:03.220 --> 00:17:04.860
 I don't know if this is still an airplane,

00:17:04.860 --> 00:17:07.180
 which is the shape of an airplane.

00:17:07.180 --> 00:17:08.420
 It's like literally an airplane.

00:17:08.420 --> 00:17:10.100
 So he was like, I'd smash the glass

00:17:10.100 --> 00:17:11.740
 and I would hold the airplane

00:17:11.740 --> 00:17:14.020
 and just feel it as we're going down

00:17:14.020 --> 00:17:15.660
 because that would tell you about the balance

00:17:15.660 --> 00:17:17.900
 of the airplane and so on, yeah, so, yeah.

00:17:17.900 --> 00:17:20.900
 So he would just, he would hold a toy airplane basically

00:17:20.900 --> 00:17:21.860
 in order to land it.

00:17:21.860 --> 00:17:25.820
 But he was someone who, if you were looking at other vehicles,

00:17:25.820 --> 00:17:28.020
 he was someone who took charge of other vehicles.

00:17:28.020 --> 00:17:30.580
 So his son said that there was one day

00:17:30.580 --> 00:17:32.740
 where he was coming home in his Corvette

00:17:32.740 --> 00:17:34.460
 and the driver got to an intersection

00:17:34.460 --> 00:17:37.620
 and he suddenly said, get out, I wanna drive it.

00:17:37.620 --> 00:17:39.940
 And the valley said, I can't let you do that.

00:17:39.940 --> 00:17:41.220
 And he said, it's my car.

00:17:41.220 --> 00:17:42.940
 And he went, oh, okay, so he got out.

00:17:42.940 --> 00:17:44.780
 And so his son said they were sitting at home

00:17:44.780 --> 00:17:47.220
 and there was this huge crash and they went outside

00:17:47.220 --> 00:17:50.180
 and the car had totaled into the side of the house.

00:17:50.180 --> 00:17:51.780
 - In fairness, what happened there

00:17:51.780 --> 00:17:53.420
 is that he was on the clutch

00:17:53.420 --> 00:17:55.020
 and he'd accidentally let the clutch go

00:17:55.020 --> 00:17:57.380
 and it kind of jumped forward into a car that came past him.

00:17:57.380 --> 00:17:58.420
 - So it's not even 'cause he's blind,

00:17:58.420 --> 00:17:59.740
 he's just a shit driver.

00:17:59.740 --> 00:18:00.580
 - Yeah.

00:18:00.580 --> 00:18:01.420
 (laughing)

00:18:01.420 --> 00:18:04.380
 - He started car adverts in the '90s.

00:18:04.380 --> 00:18:05.220
 Have you seen that?

00:18:05.220 --> 00:18:06.060
 - Oh, yeah.

00:18:06.060 --> 00:18:07.140
 - It's a gorgeous car advert

00:18:07.140 --> 00:18:10.100
 and it shows him driving on the salt flat.

00:18:10.100 --> 00:18:11.220
 You tell us Great Salt Lake.

00:18:11.220 --> 00:18:13.620
 So he's not on a road, there are no other vehicles around,

00:18:13.620 --> 00:18:15.340
 but he's having a whale of a time driving away.

00:18:15.340 --> 00:18:16.300
 It's lovely.

00:18:16.300 --> 00:18:19.140
 And his driver, by the way, guess what his driver's name was?

00:18:19.140 --> 00:18:20.740
 - I don't know.

00:18:20.740 --> 00:18:22.180
 - Clarence Driver.

00:18:22.180 --> 00:18:24.420
 - Oh, that's cool.

00:18:24.420 --> 00:18:26.620
 - He had a long history of doing this.

00:18:26.620 --> 00:18:28.820
 So the first time he took control of a car

00:18:28.820 --> 00:18:30.340
 was when he was about eight

00:18:30.340 --> 00:18:32.420
 and this was when he was at primary school

00:18:32.420 --> 00:18:33.620
 and his teachers remembered him

00:18:33.620 --> 00:18:36.740
 as kind of paid in the ass, I guess.

00:18:36.740 --> 00:18:37.980
 Kind of rebellious.

00:18:37.980 --> 00:18:40.100
 And one time at primary school,

00:18:40.100 --> 00:18:43.300
 he managed to break into one of the teacher's cars

00:18:43.300 --> 00:18:44.780
 and he went to a deaf and blind school.

00:18:44.780 --> 00:18:45.620
 It was quite groundbreaking.

00:18:45.620 --> 00:18:47.460
 It was the only one in Florida

00:18:47.460 --> 00:18:49.900
 and he was sent there as,

00:18:49.900 --> 00:18:51.420
 he was about five when he was sent there,

00:18:51.420 --> 00:18:52.260
 five or six, wasn't he?

00:18:52.260 --> 00:18:53.100
 Or maybe seven.

00:18:53.100 --> 00:18:54.260
 - Well, he only went blind then.

00:18:54.260 --> 00:18:55.860
 He went blind at the edge of about six.

00:18:55.860 --> 00:18:56.700
 - Yes.

00:18:56.700 --> 00:18:58.780
 And then his mum just sent him to the school

00:18:58.780 --> 00:18:59.820
 and yeah, he went there.

00:18:59.820 --> 00:19:01.420
 He got control of a teacher's car

00:19:01.420 --> 00:19:04.220
 and he had one of the deaf kids sit next to him

00:19:04.220 --> 00:19:05.500
 or sit on the hood of the car, I think,

00:19:05.500 --> 00:19:08.060
 and bang with either his left or right hand

00:19:08.060 --> 00:19:10.820
 to tell Ray to go left or right.

00:19:10.820 --> 00:19:12.900
 - This is a Gene Wilder film

00:19:12.900 --> 00:19:14.940
 and Richard Pire called See No Evil, Hear No Evil.

00:19:14.940 --> 00:19:15.780
 It genuinely is.

00:19:15.780 --> 00:19:17.700
 Yes, that's the plot of the film.

00:19:17.700 --> 00:19:18.900
 - Do they end up like he ended up

00:19:18.900 --> 00:19:20.220
 which was crashing into a tree?

00:19:20.220 --> 00:19:21.900
 - Yeah, I think that happens quite a lot in the film.

00:19:21.900 --> 00:19:23.140
 It's a pretty...

00:19:23.140 --> 00:19:25.220
 - He also drove motorbikes from time to time.

00:19:25.220 --> 00:19:27.540
 Definitely, this is in his autobiography.

00:19:27.540 --> 00:19:30.660
 So when he was about 14 or 15, he was in Tallahassee

00:19:30.660 --> 00:19:32.140
 and he would ride his motorbike.

00:19:32.140 --> 00:19:33.140
 And the way that he did that,

00:19:33.140 --> 00:19:34.860
 he would be in a big sort of area

00:19:34.860 --> 00:19:37.900
 with nothing else around in the same way as the advert.

00:19:37.900 --> 00:19:40.300
 But in Tallahassee, he would ride in this area

00:19:40.300 --> 00:19:42.260
 and his friend would be alongside him

00:19:42.260 --> 00:19:44.300
 so he could kind of feel him next to him

00:19:44.300 --> 00:19:45.980
 while he was motorcycling.

00:19:45.980 --> 00:19:47.020
 - So cool. - Yeah.

00:19:47.020 --> 00:19:50.220
 - He was better at music than he was at driving vehicles.

00:19:50.220 --> 00:19:51.140
 - Oh, he was quite good.

00:19:51.140 --> 00:19:54.340
 Like, I don't believe that he was in the airplane.

00:19:54.340 --> 00:19:55.380
 I believe he's in the airplane.

00:19:55.380 --> 00:19:57.260
 I don't believe he drove the airplane personally.

00:19:57.260 --> 00:19:58.100
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:19:58.100 --> 00:19:59.540
 - But if you read the biography,

00:19:59.540 --> 00:20:01.980
 there's loads of stuff where he said at one stage

00:20:01.980 --> 00:20:04.700
 and the pilot forgot to pull the flaps down on the plane

00:20:04.700 --> 00:20:06.220
 and they weren't climbing properly

00:20:06.220 --> 00:20:07.820
 and he could sense the problem.

00:20:07.820 --> 00:20:10.220
 And he said, "You need to put the flaps down."

00:20:10.220 --> 00:20:12.820
 The pilot went, "Is he wearing skies or is he Yoda?"

00:20:12.820 --> 00:20:14.380
 - Yeah. (laughing)

00:20:14.380 --> 00:20:15.420
 - There was another time

00:20:15.420 --> 00:20:17.620
 when they were flying at 11,000 feet.

00:20:17.620 --> 00:20:19.500
 Okay, the traffic controller had told them

00:20:19.500 --> 00:20:21.160
 they need to fly at 11,000.

00:20:21.160 --> 00:20:24.180
 And he said, "But I had 13,000 in my head.

00:20:24.180 --> 00:20:25.500
 So I asked the pilot to check

00:20:25.500 --> 00:20:28.180
 and sure enough, the controller had made a mistake.

00:20:28.180 --> 00:20:29.580
 Maybe we would have had enough height

00:20:29.580 --> 00:20:31.220
 to get over the mountains anyway,

00:20:31.220 --> 00:20:32.940
 but I ain't want to take chances."

00:20:32.940 --> 00:20:33.780
 (audience laughing)

00:20:33.780 --> 00:20:34.620
 - Oh my god.

00:20:34.620 --> 00:20:35.460
 - You got to play it slightly wrong.

00:20:35.460 --> 00:20:38.300
 It's 30,000 feet in the air, I have.

00:20:38.300 --> 00:20:39.340
 (laughing)

00:20:39.340 --> 00:20:41.340
 - So he was really, really into aeroplane.

00:20:41.340 --> 00:20:43.020
 Like, he really knew a lot about them

00:20:43.020 --> 00:20:44.300
 and he was properly into them.

00:20:44.300 --> 00:20:45.140
 But yeah.

00:20:45.140 --> 00:20:47.460
 - He really didn't like the idea of trading

00:20:47.460 --> 00:20:48.980
 on being a blind musician.

00:20:48.980 --> 00:20:50.220
 This is something I find really interesting.

00:20:50.220 --> 00:20:53.700
 And he, in fact, it has to do with the instrument he played.

00:20:53.700 --> 00:20:56.580
 The fact that he was a pianist instead of a guitarist

00:20:56.580 --> 00:21:00.140
 was because there were so many blind blues musicians,

00:21:00.140 --> 00:21:03.220
 particularly who played the guitar.

00:21:03.220 --> 00:21:04.780
 So there was Blind Lemon Jefferson,

00:21:04.780 --> 00:21:07.020
 Blind Willie Johnson, Blind Willie McTale,

00:21:07.020 --> 00:21:08.700
 Blind Blake, no other name.

00:21:08.700 --> 00:21:10.260
 - This is non-negative determinism, isn't it?

00:21:10.260 --> 00:21:14.860
 - Blind Kerry Davis, Blind Boy Fuller and Blind Joe Reynolds.

00:21:14.860 --> 00:21:16.940
 All of them, you know, were guitarists.

00:21:16.940 --> 00:21:19.020
 And so he said, "I don't want to be associated with that."

00:21:19.020 --> 00:21:21.020
 He said it was as much an association with blindness

00:21:21.020 --> 00:21:24.180
 as a cane to walk with the guitar.

00:21:24.180 --> 00:21:26.860
 - Although he did, he loved the piano from the age of three,

00:21:26.860 --> 00:21:27.700
 which really makes me think,

00:21:27.700 --> 00:21:30.420
 "I've missed the boat in finding my life's passion."

00:21:30.420 --> 00:21:32.740
 If that's when you've got to get it, he was three years old.

00:21:32.740 --> 00:21:35.020
 And he grew up in extreme poverty.

00:21:35.020 --> 00:21:36.980
 He really read about his early life.

00:21:36.980 --> 00:21:40.180
 And he think, "God, I suppose I'll never complain again."

00:21:40.180 --> 00:21:42.860
 You can imagine, like, a single mother,

00:21:42.860 --> 00:21:46.340
 dad's runoff, very, very poor, black family.

00:21:46.340 --> 00:21:49.420
 And he heard someone playing the piano

00:21:49.420 --> 00:21:51.220
 in the shop down the road.

00:21:51.220 --> 00:21:53.020
 And he ran through, he was three years old.

00:21:53.020 --> 00:21:55.180
 He sprinted across, pushed his way through the door,

00:21:55.180 --> 00:21:57.580
 jumped on his lap, and that was it.

00:21:57.580 --> 00:22:00.580
 He started banging away and knew he loved it from then on.

00:22:00.580 --> 00:22:03.580
 And when he went to school, when he was sent to this school,

00:22:03.580 --> 00:22:05.780
 they would talk braille, obviously.

00:22:05.780 --> 00:22:08.220
 And it was so hard to read piano music,

00:22:08.220 --> 00:22:10.820
 'cause, of course, you can only ever play while sight reading

00:22:10.820 --> 00:22:12.020
 with your left hand.

00:22:12.020 --> 00:22:13.900
 So he'd have his right hand fumbling away,

00:22:13.900 --> 00:22:15.500
 feeling the music while his left hand plays,

00:22:15.500 --> 00:22:17.980
 and then he'd have to swap, and then he'd have to memorize it.

00:22:17.980 --> 00:22:20.220
 And he could memorize thousands of pages like that.

00:22:20.220 --> 00:22:21.540
 - Yeah, he was incredible.

00:22:21.540 --> 00:22:23.020
 The braille stuff is really interesting,

00:22:23.020 --> 00:22:24.700
 'cause he was very proud of the fact

00:22:24.700 --> 00:22:28.100
 that he could get on normally while being blind.

00:22:28.100 --> 00:22:30.380
 And so everything that he got was in braille.

00:22:30.380 --> 00:22:32.540
 If a contract was sent to him and it wasn't in braille,

00:22:32.540 --> 00:22:34.180
 he would refuse to sign it.

00:22:34.180 --> 00:22:35.740
 - I think that's fair enough.

00:22:35.740 --> 00:22:37.780
 It feels like someone's trying to do one over on you,

00:22:37.780 --> 00:22:39.580
 if that's what they're sending you.

00:22:39.580 --> 00:22:40.620
 - That's a good point.

00:22:40.620 --> 00:22:45.100
 - No, but he got to see Ray, the movie, with Jamie Foxx,

00:22:45.100 --> 00:22:47.340
 and they turned the script into braille for him

00:22:47.340 --> 00:22:49.180
 so that he could read it and sort of fact check it

00:22:49.180 --> 00:22:50.460
 and so on as it was going on.

00:22:50.460 --> 00:22:52.580
 - They should have made a 3D film

00:22:52.580 --> 00:22:53.780
 where he could feel the screen

00:22:53.780 --> 00:22:55.340
 and they're bulging out of it.

00:22:55.340 --> 00:22:56.460
 Why don't we have that?

00:22:56.460 --> 00:22:58.180
 - Why don't we have a, I would.

00:22:58.180 --> 00:23:00.740
 Could it be cost-effective?

00:23:00.740 --> 00:23:01.580
 I don't know.

00:23:01.580 --> 00:23:02.420
 - I don't know.

00:23:02.420 --> 00:23:03.940
 - It's not very COVID secure.

00:23:03.940 --> 00:23:06.220
 Everyone in the cinema, especially,

00:23:06.220 --> 00:23:07.900
 everyone just groping forward at the screen.

00:23:07.900 --> 00:23:08.740
 - And if you've got the seat,

00:23:08.740 --> 00:23:10.420
 that's the top left corner of the screen.

00:23:10.420 --> 00:23:12.500
 You're not putting any action.

00:23:12.500 --> 00:23:13.940
 He was really good at chess, wasn't he?

00:23:13.940 --> 00:23:15.180
 And he had his own chess set

00:23:15.180 --> 00:23:18.180
 where the black squares were all raised slightly

00:23:18.180 --> 00:23:19.660
 and all the black pieces were pointy

00:23:19.660 --> 00:23:21.060
 and all the white pieces were round

00:23:21.060 --> 00:23:22.420
 so he could feel which was which.

00:23:22.420 --> 00:23:23.580
 - Yeah. - It was really cool.

00:23:23.580 --> 00:23:26.500
 - Did you read about him playing Willie Nelson at chess?

00:23:26.500 --> 00:23:27.340
 - Go on.

00:23:27.340 --> 00:23:28.540
 - He played Willie Nelson,

00:23:28.540 --> 00:23:30.260
 another great musician at chess.

00:23:30.260 --> 00:23:31.660
 He challenged Willie Nelson to a game

00:23:31.660 --> 00:23:33.980
 back in his hotel room or wherever he was

00:23:33.980 --> 00:23:36.180
 and obviously Ray Charles was blind

00:23:36.180 --> 00:23:37.300
 so he kept the lights off.

00:23:37.300 --> 00:23:38.140
 So...

00:23:38.140 --> 00:23:39.580
 (audience laughing)

00:23:39.580 --> 00:23:40.900
 - You gotta save electricity, right?

00:23:40.900 --> 00:23:41.740
 - To save electricity?

00:23:41.740 --> 00:23:42.580
 What's the point of lighting it?

00:23:42.580 --> 00:23:44.820
 So he thrashed Willie Nelson at chess.

00:23:44.820 --> 00:23:45.660
 (audience laughing)

00:23:45.660 --> 00:23:48.220
 And Willie Nelson couldn't fucking see what was going on.

00:23:48.220 --> 00:23:49.580
 That's so good.

00:23:49.580 --> 00:23:51.740
 Do you, you had this really weird thing

00:23:51.740 --> 00:23:53.700
 which I didn't believe for ages

00:23:53.700 --> 00:23:55.380
 but I've found enough sources

00:23:55.380 --> 00:23:57.340
 and the guy seems legit.

00:23:57.340 --> 00:24:01.380
 During the '90s, he got really bored of giving interviews

00:24:01.380 --> 00:24:04.060
 but he had to give interviews for promotional purposes.

00:24:04.060 --> 00:24:07.860
 So instead, he got a white guy from New Jersey

00:24:07.860 --> 00:24:10.420
 to be him in all the interviews that he did.

00:24:10.420 --> 00:24:11.500
 - No way. - Yeah.

00:24:11.500 --> 00:24:13.740
 So this is a producer and writer guy

00:24:13.740 --> 00:24:17.220
 who interviewed him, a new Ray Charles inside out.

00:24:17.220 --> 00:24:19.460
 When they had their interview, Ray was so impressed.

00:24:19.460 --> 00:24:20.540
 He just thought, this is incredible.

00:24:20.540 --> 00:24:21.900
 We have to meet up again.

00:24:21.900 --> 00:24:22.940
 And then there was this interview

00:24:22.940 --> 00:24:24.740
 that was gonna happen with a guy.

00:24:24.740 --> 00:24:27.300
 The interviewer came over and Ray called him up.

00:24:27.300 --> 00:24:30.380
 He calls him his white Ray Charles, this guy.

00:24:30.380 --> 00:24:31.460
 (audience laughing)

00:24:31.460 --> 00:24:33.300
 And so he comes over and he says,

00:24:33.300 --> 00:24:35.540
 I want you to do the interview as me

00:24:35.540 --> 00:24:36.700
 and give all the answers

00:24:36.700 --> 00:24:38.220
 'cause I can't be bothered doing it.

00:24:38.220 --> 00:24:39.500
 So he said, okay, I'll do that.

00:24:39.500 --> 00:24:41.140
 So he sits there and he starts doing it

00:24:41.140 --> 00:24:42.460
 and the guy asks a question

00:24:42.460 --> 00:24:44.420
 and he says, well, Ray would say that.

00:24:44.420 --> 00:24:45.940
 And Ray said, no, no, no, no.

00:24:45.940 --> 00:24:48.220
 Don't say Ray would say, say I would say,

00:24:48.220 --> 00:24:50.060
 you are me in this interview.

00:24:50.060 --> 00:24:52.740
 And they did this whole interview where he was Ray

00:24:52.740 --> 00:24:54.460
 and it went so well that Ray said,

00:24:54.460 --> 00:24:56.340
 we must do that again.

00:24:56.340 --> 00:24:58.660
 And for a decade, virtually.

00:24:58.660 --> 00:24:59.500
 - But not on television.

00:24:59.500 --> 00:25:00.340
 - Not on television.

00:25:00.340 --> 00:25:01.700
 This were all print interviews

00:25:01.700 --> 00:25:04.020
 and people if they were calling up over the phone,

00:25:04.020 --> 00:25:05.260
 he would do the interview.

00:25:05.260 --> 00:25:07.140
 Has read this white guy from New Jersey.

00:25:07.140 --> 00:25:07.980
 - That's amazing.

00:25:07.980 --> 00:25:09.180
 - Yeah, that's so funny.

00:25:09.180 --> 00:25:11.300
 And after Ray died, there was even a book,

00:25:11.300 --> 00:25:13.820
 a photography that was taken by a personal friend

00:25:13.820 --> 00:25:16.460
 who said to him, Ray can't write this book now.

00:25:16.460 --> 00:25:18.100
 Would you mind writing it as him?

00:25:18.100 --> 00:25:20.020
 He posed his death.

00:25:20.020 --> 00:25:21.540
 He said, no, but yeah.

00:25:21.540 --> 00:25:23.460
 - Is this where, did they have a fight at one point?

00:25:23.460 --> 00:25:24.540
 Ray's saying, what's all this shit

00:25:24.540 --> 00:25:25.940
 about me driving a plane?

00:25:25.940 --> 00:25:27.420
 I'm glad you're stupid.

00:25:27.420 --> 00:25:33.500
 - He did one really fun thing when he was a kid.

00:25:33.500 --> 00:25:37.560
 He, like I say, he was like a bit of a lovable troublemaker

00:25:37.560 --> 00:25:38.820
 is the impression that I got.

00:25:38.820 --> 00:25:41.260
 And he used to love playing piano at school

00:25:41.260 --> 00:25:43.620
 and there was another kid from,

00:25:43.620 --> 00:25:45.700
 so the school was segregated

00:25:45.700 --> 00:25:47.180
 and there were a bunch of white kids

00:25:47.180 --> 00:25:48.420
 who got a better education

00:25:48.420 --> 00:25:50.580
 and then the black kids basically like got less good,

00:25:50.580 --> 00:25:52.180
 got less good equipment, all of that.

00:25:52.180 --> 00:25:54.100
 And one of the white kids really wanted to come

00:25:54.100 --> 00:25:56.580
 and play the piano, which was in the black kids'

00:25:56.580 --> 00:25:57.660
 part of the school.

00:25:57.660 --> 00:25:59.980
 And so this kid came up to Ray and said,

00:25:59.980 --> 00:26:01.060
 I need to use a piano.

00:26:01.060 --> 00:26:02.500
 You need to let me, you need to get off the piano.

00:26:02.500 --> 00:26:03.460
 I need to use it.

00:26:03.460 --> 00:26:05.020
 So Ray said, fine, you can have it.

00:26:05.020 --> 00:26:06.460
 Just give me 15 minutes.

00:26:06.460 --> 00:26:08.540
 And this was related by his best friend

00:26:08.540 --> 00:26:09.980
 at the time who was a guy called Joe.

00:26:09.980 --> 00:26:11.420
 And Joe said, I thought that was weird

00:26:11.420 --> 00:26:13.680
 'cause Ray would never give up without a fight.

00:26:13.680 --> 00:26:15.500
 And lo and behold, they were in their dorm,

00:26:15.500 --> 00:26:17.460
 like, you know, half an hour later

00:26:17.460 --> 00:26:19.540
 and the white kid comes up furious

00:26:19.540 --> 00:26:21.340
 and Ray spent that 15 minutes

00:26:21.340 --> 00:26:23.940
 unscrewing every single key on the piano,

00:26:23.940 --> 00:26:25.220
 putting it in his bag.

00:26:25.220 --> 00:26:27.940
 And they go, you said you're only one of the piano.

00:26:27.940 --> 00:26:29.660
 - That's so funny. - That's so funny.

00:26:29.660 --> 00:26:32.100
 - We've got to move on in a sec to our next fact.

00:26:32.100 --> 00:26:35.860
 - I just found one other guy who can fly their own aircraft.

00:26:35.860 --> 00:26:37.020
 - What, what?

00:26:37.020 --> 00:26:37.980
 - Put an unusual one.

00:26:37.980 --> 00:26:39.940
 - Yeah, like there's a lot who can fly.

00:26:39.940 --> 00:26:40.780
 - Oh yeah. - What do you mean?

00:26:40.780 --> 00:26:41.620
 - Quite a few.

00:26:41.620 --> 00:26:43.460
 - Well, this guy was Pope Benedict the 16th, Dan.

00:26:43.460 --> 00:26:45.340
 (laughing)

00:26:45.340 --> 00:26:47.540
 Is that unusual enough for you?

00:26:47.540 --> 00:26:48.540
 - Thank you.

00:26:48.540 --> 00:26:51.180
 - You've got to work on the lead-in to that.

00:26:51.180 --> 00:26:52.980
 - Now look, this, I mean, James,

00:26:52.980 --> 00:26:54.420
 if you're skeptical about Ray Charles,

00:26:54.420 --> 00:26:57.620
 the idea of Benny the 16th flying the papal chopper,

00:26:57.620 --> 00:27:00.140
 I've only found it on the website called Catholic News Facts

00:27:00.140 --> 00:27:01.340
 and it's only there.

00:27:01.340 --> 00:27:03.140
 And I feel like they'd have given it more airtime

00:27:03.140 --> 00:27:04.940
 as the Pope could fly a helicopter.

00:27:04.940 --> 00:27:05.780
 - How implausible was it?

00:27:05.780 --> 00:27:07.420
 Was he one of the sort of 17th century ones?

00:27:07.420 --> 00:27:09.580
 I always find it hard to keep track of, was it at least?

00:27:09.580 --> 00:27:10.700
 - No, he was the last but one.

00:27:10.700 --> 00:27:11.820
 - Got it.

00:27:11.820 --> 00:27:12.660
 - The last but one.

00:27:12.660 --> 00:27:13.500
 - The last one, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:27:13.500 --> 00:27:14.420
 - The one who resumed.

00:27:14.420 --> 00:27:16.060
 - So what's the story?

00:27:16.060 --> 00:27:17.060
 Is he-- - He can fly a helicopter,

00:27:17.060 --> 00:27:18.060
 that's the story. - Okay, cool.

00:27:18.060 --> 00:27:19.980
 (laughing)

00:27:19.980 --> 00:27:21.140
 - Well, thank God we didn't move on

00:27:21.140 --> 00:27:22.460
 before you got that story in there.

00:27:22.460 --> 00:27:25.340
 (laughing)

00:27:25.340 --> 00:27:26.260
 - Wow.

00:27:26.260 --> 00:27:28.740
 - Now it's time for fact number three,

00:27:28.740 --> 00:27:30.580
 and that is, oh, Andy.

00:27:30.580 --> 00:27:32.540
 - My factor is the Pope can fly a helicopter.

00:27:32.540 --> 00:27:34.780
 (laughing)

00:27:34.780 --> 00:27:37.020
 (cheering)

00:27:37.020 --> 00:27:39.460
 - Thank you.

00:27:39.460 --> 00:27:41.940
 - Solid gold.

00:27:41.940 --> 00:27:45.420
 - I know, my fact is there is a zookeeper in America

00:27:45.420 --> 00:27:48.380
 who cannot change job because the bird he looks after

00:27:48.380 --> 00:27:49.660
 is in love with him.

00:27:49.660 --> 00:27:50.820
 (laughing)

00:27:50.820 --> 00:27:53.220
 It's, this is such a sweet story.

00:27:53.220 --> 00:27:54.660
 - I don't think it's very sweet.

00:27:54.660 --> 00:27:57.420
 - Well, we'll get onto the real details in a minute,

00:27:57.420 --> 00:27:59.780
 but the broad brushstrokes are very sweet.

00:27:59.780 --> 00:28:02.140
 This was sent to me by a guy called Ali Bobson,

00:28:02.140 --> 00:28:03.340
 so thank you very much, Ali.

00:28:03.340 --> 00:28:05.740
 It's this brilliant Washington Post investigation.

00:28:05.740 --> 00:28:08.620
 There is a crane, a crane to these very tall,

00:28:08.620 --> 00:28:10.100
 very elegant birds.

00:28:10.100 --> 00:28:12.540
 And this one is very endangered.

00:28:12.540 --> 00:28:14.740
 It is a white napped crane,

00:28:14.740 --> 00:28:16.620
 unbelievably rare and endangered,

00:28:16.620 --> 00:28:19.140
 and it lives at the Smithsonian Conservation Institute

00:28:19.140 --> 00:28:19.980
 in Virginia.

00:28:19.980 --> 00:28:21.140
 There's a breeding center there.

00:28:21.140 --> 00:28:22.420
 They had this bird.

00:28:22.420 --> 00:28:24.620
 It was a female bird needed to be bred with

00:28:24.620 --> 00:28:27.740
 to preserve the species, but it was a deadly bird.

00:28:27.740 --> 00:28:31.260
 It allegedly had killed at least two previous partners

00:28:31.260 --> 00:28:32.300
 rather than mate with them.

00:28:32.300 --> 00:28:33.980
 It wasn't taking any shit, yeah.

00:28:33.980 --> 00:28:38.620
 So problem, and they realized maybe it has imprinted

00:28:38.620 --> 00:28:40.020
 when it was a young chick,

00:28:40.020 --> 00:28:44.060
 it thought a human was its parent rather than a crane bird.

00:28:44.060 --> 00:28:46.900
 So it is programmed to love humans.

00:28:46.900 --> 00:28:49.780
 And so they got this keeper who is called Mr. Crow.

00:28:49.780 --> 00:28:50.620
 Amazing.

00:28:50.620 --> 00:28:51.580
 (audience laughing)

00:28:51.580 --> 00:28:52.820
 Chris Crow.

00:28:52.820 --> 00:28:53.780
 - Don't jump.

00:28:53.780 --> 00:28:55.100
 - Jump, jump.

00:28:55.100 --> 00:28:56.780
 (audience laughing)

00:28:56.780 --> 00:28:58.300
 Sorry, it just sounds like it.

00:28:58.300 --> 00:28:59.260
 - Chris Cross.

00:28:59.260 --> 00:29:00.100
 - Chris Cross.

00:29:00.100 --> 00:29:01.460
 - Don't get it, don't get it.

00:29:01.460 --> 00:29:03.180
 But they loved it.

00:29:03.180 --> 00:29:07.820
 And so they, in Chris Crow and Warner

00:29:07.820 --> 00:29:09.340
 are now basically an item.

00:29:09.340 --> 00:29:12.060
 And they have done a lot of work,

00:29:12.060 --> 00:29:13.420
 breeding work together.

00:29:13.420 --> 00:29:14.260
 (audience laughing)

00:29:14.260 --> 00:29:16.100
 - And this is where it gets a bit icky, yeah.

00:29:16.100 --> 00:29:18.100
 - This is where it gets a fraction icky

00:29:18.100 --> 00:29:20.140
 if you're squeamish, yeah.

00:29:20.140 --> 00:29:23.940
 - So he slowly earned the female cranes trust

00:29:23.940 --> 00:29:28.220
 by sitting with her and touching her and all that stuff.

00:29:28.220 --> 00:29:31.060
 And dancing, like dancing with her is the main thing.

00:29:31.060 --> 00:29:33.260
 Like a lot of the cranes, before they get together,

00:29:33.260 --> 00:29:35.660
 they do this kind of head bobbing dance and stuff.

00:29:35.660 --> 00:29:37.140
 And he did all that with her as well.

00:29:37.140 --> 00:29:39.540
 When no one was looking, he said.

00:29:39.540 --> 00:29:43.980
 And now, basically, she will let him inseminate her.

00:29:43.980 --> 00:29:46.060
 'Cause previously, if you had a crane

00:29:46.060 --> 00:29:48.100
 and you needed to artificially inseminate them,

00:29:48.100 --> 00:29:49.700
 you'd probably have to use that aesthetic,

00:29:49.700 --> 00:29:50.780
 all that kind of stuff.

00:29:50.780 --> 00:29:52.260
 She is well up for it.

00:29:52.260 --> 00:29:53.100
 - Yeah.

00:29:53.100 --> 00:29:53.940
 (audience laughing)

00:29:53.940 --> 00:29:55.740
 - And he doesn't, we should clarify,

00:29:55.740 --> 00:29:57.860
 inseminate her with his own seed.

00:29:57.860 --> 00:29:59.220
 (laughing)

00:29:59.220 --> 00:30:02.660
 And he does remain fully clothed throughout this process.

00:30:02.660 --> 00:30:06.500
 He puts a different crane sperm into her cloaca.

00:30:06.500 --> 00:30:09.260
 Actually, interestingly, the other crane is called Ray.

00:30:09.260 --> 00:30:11.100
 - No, really.

00:30:11.100 --> 00:30:12.300
 - It's a different one, different Ray.

00:30:12.300 --> 00:30:13.140
 - Different Ray, yeah.

00:30:13.140 --> 00:30:14.220
 (audience laughing)

00:30:14.220 --> 00:30:15.820
 - The article you sent around, though, Andy,

00:30:15.820 --> 00:30:19.340
 it does, like, as James says, it reads a bit bizarre.

00:30:19.340 --> 00:30:21.140
 So, like, literally taking the words,

00:30:21.140 --> 00:30:24.140
 it says, kneeling behind the bird.

00:30:24.140 --> 00:30:25.900
 Oh, don't put that tone of voice on it.

00:30:25.900 --> 00:30:27.620
 If you don't, wait a minute, like that.

00:30:27.620 --> 00:30:29.860
 It'll make anything sound mucky.

00:30:29.860 --> 00:30:32.620
 Crow rests a hand gently on her back.

00:30:32.620 --> 00:30:33.460
 (audience laughing)

00:30:33.460 --> 00:30:36.380
 Then he starts rubbing her thighs.

00:30:36.380 --> 00:30:40.100
 Rhythmically, 30 seconds elapsed.

00:30:40.100 --> 00:30:42.840
 Before Walnut steps away, it's called Walnut, by the way.

00:30:42.840 --> 00:30:44.980
 (audience laughing)

00:30:44.980 --> 00:30:46.580
 Walnut steps away from Crow,

00:30:46.580 --> 00:30:48.740
 fixes a few out-of-place feathers,

00:30:48.740 --> 00:30:50.660
 and then stretches out her wings,

00:30:50.660 --> 00:30:53.020
 asking for another go-around.

00:30:53.020 --> 00:30:54.180
 (audience laughing)

00:30:54.180 --> 00:30:55.500
 - Dan, if this is your audition tape

00:30:55.500 --> 00:30:58.580
 for my dad wrote a porno, it means a lot of work.

00:30:58.580 --> 00:31:00.420
 - And then it says, "Crow then takes the opportunity

00:31:00.420 --> 00:31:02.820
 "to inject Walnut with a syringe of crane semen."

00:31:02.820 --> 00:31:04.700
 (audience laughing)

00:31:04.700 --> 00:31:06.900
 Like every beautiful relationship.

00:31:06.900 --> 00:31:09.460
 - But she keeps on wanting to mate with him,

00:31:09.460 --> 00:31:10.580
 even though at the moment,

00:31:10.580 --> 00:31:13.700
 they don't need any more eggs from her.

00:31:13.700 --> 00:31:15.700
 But sometimes, he will just keep her happy

00:31:15.700 --> 00:31:17.300
 by doing the massage.

00:31:17.300 --> 00:31:19.860
 - And he gives fake eggs, doesn't he?

00:31:19.860 --> 00:31:20.700
 - Yes.

00:31:20.700 --> 00:31:22.860
 - 'Cause you can't give a social create eggs,

00:31:22.860 --> 00:31:24.380
 but they don't need to be inseminated anymore,

00:31:24.380 --> 00:31:25.820
 so they'll just sit and rot.

00:31:25.820 --> 00:31:26.980
 So they have to chop the eggs out

00:31:26.980 --> 00:31:28.700
 and put fake eggs underneath her

00:31:28.700 --> 00:31:30.580
 to convince her that she's doing good jobs at night.

00:31:30.580 --> 00:31:31.700
 - But then she gets tired,

00:31:31.700 --> 00:31:33.620
 she gets tired looking after the fake eggs,

00:31:33.620 --> 00:31:35.020
 which he has switched out.

00:31:35.020 --> 00:31:37.460
 So he sometimes has to stand over the eggs

00:31:37.460 --> 00:31:38.980
 and watch them for her,

00:31:38.980 --> 00:31:40.820
 even though he knows they're fake,

00:31:40.820 --> 00:31:43.100
 so that she can have a break

00:31:43.100 --> 00:31:45.140
 from looking after these rubber eggs.

00:31:45.140 --> 00:31:46.540
 - I feel it, it does feel like

00:31:46.540 --> 00:31:48.380
 he's going himself into a bit of a bind, doesn't it?

00:31:48.380 --> 00:31:49.940
 - I know, it's so funny.

00:31:49.940 --> 00:31:51.660
 - Last we heard he was single.

00:31:51.660 --> 00:31:56.340
 As far as human partners is concerned,

00:31:56.340 --> 00:31:57.860
 he said in one interview,

00:31:57.860 --> 00:32:00.260
 "Walnut sets the bar pretty high.

00:32:00.260 --> 00:32:02.940
 "I'll never find a woman that's so happy to see me

00:32:02.940 --> 00:32:05.500
 "that she just starts dancing."

00:32:05.500 --> 00:32:06.940
 - It's so sweet.

00:32:06.940 --> 00:32:09.340
 - It's like a roller coaster of sweetness

00:32:09.340 --> 00:32:10.980
 and ickyness, isn't it?

00:32:10.980 --> 00:32:12.700
 - He has cheated on her though.

00:32:12.700 --> 00:32:13.700
 - What?

00:32:13.700 --> 00:32:16.580
 - Yeah, he's inseminated two other cranes.

00:32:16.580 --> 00:32:17.860
 - Okay.

00:32:17.860 --> 00:32:18.860
 - He's got a type.

00:32:18.860 --> 00:32:19.860
 I'm not denying that.

00:32:19.860 --> 00:32:23.020
 - Are they in the same zoo?

00:32:23.020 --> 00:32:23.860
 - Yeah.

00:32:23.860 --> 00:32:24.700
 - Yeah, they are in the same zoo,

00:32:24.700 --> 00:32:27.020
 but I don't think Walnut knows about so.

00:32:27.020 --> 00:32:28.700
 - I hope she doesn't listen to this.

00:32:28.700 --> 00:32:32.140
 - Yeah, but that would be terrible.

00:32:32.140 --> 00:32:34.380
 - But no, he's now a kind of love guru

00:32:34.380 --> 00:32:36.140
 for the cranes in this place.

00:32:36.140 --> 00:32:38.020
 - Really, he knows it, yeah.

00:32:38.020 --> 00:32:40.220
 - And apparently the way the cranes flirt

00:32:40.220 --> 00:32:42.380
 most effectively, aside from this dance,

00:32:42.380 --> 00:32:44.580
 is by picking up nesting material,

00:32:44.580 --> 00:32:46.860
 'cause showing that you want to build a home together,

00:32:46.860 --> 00:32:48.860
 aw, again, we're back into sweet,

00:32:48.860 --> 00:32:50.780
 sort of in a 1950s kind of way.

00:32:50.780 --> 00:32:53.260
 - Have you ever tried going on a date around John Lewis?

00:32:53.260 --> 00:32:56.900
 It's very, it's sexy stuff, yeah.

00:32:56.900 --> 00:32:57.820
 - It's much like that,

00:32:57.820 --> 00:33:00.620
 except that John Lewis saw the sticks and twigs,

00:33:00.620 --> 00:33:01.580
 bits of grass.

00:33:01.580 --> 00:33:03.300
 - Yeah, there are, I mean, this is not the first,

00:33:03.300 --> 00:33:04.620
 Chris Crowe did not invent this

00:33:04.620 --> 00:33:06.340
 in case anyone was looking for, you know,

00:33:06.340 --> 00:33:09.140
 this is not the first human crane marriage, as it were.

00:33:09.140 --> 00:33:13.940
 The real daddy of this,

00:33:13.940 --> 00:33:15.260
 I regret saying daddy already.

00:33:15.260 --> 00:33:18.860
 There's a scientist called George Archibald,

00:33:18.860 --> 00:33:21.020
 who is a don of the crane world.

00:33:21.020 --> 00:33:23.940
 He founded the International Crane Foundation.

00:33:23.940 --> 00:33:27.020
 Just to give you an idea, he's pretty big in Crane Town.

00:33:27.020 --> 00:33:29.500
 And he, in 1976, there was a bird called Tex,

00:33:29.500 --> 00:33:32.580
 which again needed to be mated with to preserve the species.

00:33:32.580 --> 00:33:35.740
 And he moved in next to her for three months,

00:33:35.740 --> 00:33:39.500
 as in he put his bed next to her area where she lived,

00:33:39.500 --> 00:33:42.340
 mimicked her dance moves from five a.m. every morning.

00:33:42.340 --> 00:33:44.260
 - Wow, wow. - Was truly dedicated.

00:33:44.260 --> 00:33:45.980
 And they built a nest together.

00:33:45.980 --> 00:33:48.740
 And they worked together for, worked together for...

00:33:48.740 --> 00:33:50.500
 (laughing)

00:33:50.500 --> 00:33:52.780
 - She's my colleague, darling, honestly.

00:33:52.780 --> 00:33:55.540
 I just have to be in the office early again.

00:33:55.540 --> 00:33:57.780
 - I think he might have invented the practice

00:33:57.780 --> 00:34:00.380
 of dressing up as a crane,

00:34:00.380 --> 00:34:03.340
 which you now have to do to feed chicks

00:34:03.340 --> 00:34:05.100
 so that this problem doesn't perpetuate itself,

00:34:05.100 --> 00:34:07.660
 so that the chicks don't imprint on humans.

00:34:07.660 --> 00:34:08.500
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:34:08.500 --> 00:34:10.340
 - Well, you dress your hand up as a crane for the feeding,

00:34:10.340 --> 00:34:11.180
 don't you? - Yeah, it's interesting.

00:34:11.180 --> 00:34:12.020
 - You get like a glove puppet.

00:34:12.020 --> 00:34:14.540
 - Like you're in like a full white hood, aren't you?

00:34:14.540 --> 00:34:16.300
 And then you have like the bird's hand.

00:34:16.300 --> 00:34:18.380
 You're not like Rod Hull.

00:34:18.380 --> 00:34:21.980
 If he joined the KKK, that's what it would look like.

00:34:21.980 --> 00:34:23.460
 - He moved to that little community

00:34:23.460 --> 00:34:25.500
 in Green Valley, the observatory.

00:34:26.500 --> 00:34:28.100
 And you can never say a word.

00:34:28.100 --> 00:34:31.180
 You can't speak words to them when you're in the robe.

00:34:31.180 --> 00:34:32.740
 You have to make crane noises, obviously.

00:34:32.740 --> 00:34:35.300
 - How do they, do you know how they sound?

00:34:35.300 --> 00:34:36.580
 Just out of curiosity.

00:34:36.580 --> 00:34:37.400
 - I don't know.

00:34:37.400 --> 00:34:39.660
 (laughing)

00:34:39.660 --> 00:34:40.500
 - No.

00:34:40.500 --> 00:34:41.660
 - 'Cause they're like, I didn't realize

00:34:41.660 --> 00:34:45.180
 I didn't know cranes that well up until this fact.

00:34:45.180 --> 00:34:46.340
 They're massive.

00:34:46.340 --> 00:34:47.380
 - Yeah, they're huge, they're huge.

00:34:47.380 --> 00:34:49.900
 - They can be up to six foot, six tall.

00:34:49.900 --> 00:34:51.900
 Like that's a big ass bird, right?

00:34:51.900 --> 00:34:53.220
 - Yeah.

00:34:53.220 --> 00:34:54.820
 - They're the biggest, biggest flying ones,

00:34:54.820 --> 00:34:56.780
 tallest flying ones, aren't they?

00:34:56.780 --> 00:34:57.660
 Obviously you've got the shit ones

00:34:57.660 --> 00:34:59.340
 like the ostrich that don't count anymore.

00:34:59.340 --> 00:35:00.940
 (laughing)

00:35:00.940 --> 00:35:02.940
 - Yeah, that's right, they fly so high.

00:35:02.940 --> 00:35:03.780
 - Yeah.

00:35:03.780 --> 00:35:05.260
 - They can get like 30,000 feet in the air.

00:35:05.260 --> 00:35:06.620
 - Well, they're very tall, yeah.

00:35:06.620 --> 00:35:07.900
 (laughing)

00:35:07.900 --> 00:35:09.060
 - Their legs are still on the ground

00:35:09.060 --> 00:35:09.900
 for a lot of that time.

00:35:09.900 --> 00:35:11.460
 - That's true.

00:35:11.460 --> 00:35:12.500
 That's amazing, isn't it?

00:35:12.500 --> 00:35:14.420
 And there's a lot of mythology around them

00:35:14.420 --> 00:35:16.140
 because they can fly so high

00:35:16.140 --> 00:35:18.940
 that they disappear from your actual eyesight.

00:35:18.940 --> 00:35:19.780
 You can't see them.

00:35:19.780 --> 00:35:22.020
 But their voices still at that height

00:35:22.020 --> 00:35:24.020
 are so booming that you can hear them.

00:35:24.020 --> 00:35:26.380
 So it's a sort of like, oh, there's a crane in the air.

00:35:26.380 --> 00:35:27.700
 - They make a lot of noise, don't they?

00:35:27.700 --> 00:35:30.460
 Their track here is as long as they are.

00:35:30.460 --> 00:35:32.740
 But it kind of winds around a little bit,

00:35:32.740 --> 00:35:34.060
 but they make this huge booming.

00:35:34.060 --> 00:35:35.340
 Not like, and he's, "Wah!"

00:35:35.340 --> 00:35:36.180
 - Yeah.

00:35:36.180 --> 00:35:37.020
 - It's more like, "Wah!"

00:35:37.020 --> 00:35:38.340
 (laughing)

00:35:38.340 --> 00:35:40.540
 - Neither of you is successfully seducing a crane,

00:35:40.540 --> 00:35:42.100
 is my judgment.

00:35:42.100 --> 00:35:42.940
 - We'll get lettuce.

00:35:42.940 --> 00:35:45.060
 - Yeah, so they need to fly high to migrate.

00:35:45.060 --> 00:35:46.500
 They're big old migrators.

00:35:46.500 --> 00:35:48.860
 And there's an issue now,

00:35:48.860 --> 00:35:51.660
 'cause a lot of them are very endangered, like you said.

00:35:51.660 --> 00:35:54.500
 And I think certain cranes at the Hooper Cranes

00:35:54.500 --> 00:35:57.860
 were down to almost single figures in about the 1940s.

00:35:57.860 --> 00:35:59.340
 But their populations have gone up.

00:35:59.340 --> 00:36:02.420
 It's been like quite a success story of conservation.

00:36:02.420 --> 00:36:05.420
 But the way they've gone up is by humans raising them.

00:36:05.420 --> 00:36:06.700
 And this has a slight problem

00:36:06.700 --> 00:36:08.300
 where if their parents aren't raising them,

00:36:08.300 --> 00:36:10.820
 they're not really evolving to know their migration routes.

00:36:10.820 --> 00:36:12.820
 So there's been a couple of people

00:36:12.820 --> 00:36:15.060
 who have had to migrate with them.

00:36:15.060 --> 00:36:16.220
 And they do this by,

00:36:16.220 --> 00:36:18.460
 I don't know if anyone's seen the film, Fly Away Home.

00:36:18.460 --> 00:36:20.420
 But it's basically that.

00:36:20.420 --> 00:36:22.900
 So you get a microlight for anyone who hasn't,

00:36:22.900 --> 00:36:24.580
 like a little light aircraft.

00:36:24.580 --> 00:36:26.740
 And you still have to be dressed up as a crane.

00:36:26.740 --> 00:36:28.980
 So I don't know what the crane fucking thinks now.

00:36:28.980 --> 00:36:31.220
 - I think the Pope did this once, didn't he?

00:36:31.220 --> 00:36:33.780
 (audience laughing)

00:36:33.780 --> 00:36:35.860
 So do you have to stay in costume when you're flying?

00:36:35.860 --> 00:36:37.380
 - Yes, so now the cranes all think

00:36:37.380 --> 00:36:40.660
 that their leading crane knows how to fly a microlight.

00:36:40.660 --> 00:36:44.300
 And the first person who did this was a guy called Kent Clegg,

00:36:44.300 --> 00:36:48.820
 who was like Nick Clegg's very much cooler older brother,

00:36:48.820 --> 00:36:50.900
 biologist and a craneer in the '90s.

00:36:50.900 --> 00:36:54.500
 And yeah, he flew with them, it's an 850 mile journey.

00:36:54.500 --> 00:36:58.700
 And he flew with them down from basically Idaho,

00:36:58.700 --> 00:37:01.540
 which is on the Canadian border basically, to New Mexico.

00:37:01.540 --> 00:37:04.340
 And others have been doing it still, but...

00:37:04.340 --> 00:37:06.620
 - I think in 2015, the US decided

00:37:06.620 --> 00:37:08.780
 that they were gonna try and stop doing it

00:37:08.780 --> 00:37:10.700
 because of the problem of,

00:37:10.700 --> 00:37:14.180
 that the cranes learn better from other cranes basically.

00:37:14.180 --> 00:37:16.260
 So now that there's quite a lot more of them,

00:37:16.260 --> 00:37:18.780
 they're in the hundreds now, they're thinking let's phase it out.

00:37:18.780 --> 00:37:21.140
 - Yeah, well, they basically weren't mating.

00:37:21.140 --> 00:37:23.900
 The whole point of migrating is to go up and mate.

00:37:23.900 --> 00:37:27.420
 So you fly to have kids up in Canada or whatever,

00:37:27.420 --> 00:37:28.620
 and so they flew them there,

00:37:28.620 --> 00:37:32.420
 but then the humans didn't know how to show them how to mate.

00:37:32.420 --> 00:37:33.740
 - Send for crew!

00:37:33.740 --> 00:37:36.380
 (audience laughing)

00:37:36.380 --> 00:37:37.940
 - Just awkwardly making conversation

00:37:37.940 --> 00:37:41.300
 with each other for three months and then going home.

00:37:41.300 --> 00:37:42.980
 - There's a really prosaic example of that,

00:37:42.980 --> 00:37:45.100
 teaching the cranes what goes on.

00:37:45.100 --> 00:37:47.740
 It's like you're raising them as a person in a costume

00:37:47.740 --> 00:37:50.380
 with a glove puppet, a weird glove puppet on your arm,

00:37:50.380 --> 00:37:51.380
 and you're not allowed to speak,

00:37:51.380 --> 00:37:53.820
 but also they are taught to be afraid of foxes

00:37:53.820 --> 00:37:55.340
 because that's not instinctive to them.

00:37:55.340 --> 00:37:56.300
 So they have to be taught.

00:37:56.300 --> 00:37:59.660
 And the way you teach them is to dress up dogs as foxes

00:37:59.660 --> 00:38:01.100
 and get them to harass them.

00:38:01.100 --> 00:38:01.940
 - Oh really? - Yeah.

00:38:01.940 --> 00:38:04.820
 - This is so the humans are dressed as cranes.

00:38:04.820 --> 00:38:05.660
 (audience laughing)

00:38:05.660 --> 00:38:06.500
 Who's dressed as a fox?

00:38:06.500 --> 00:38:08.060
 The dogs are dressed as foxes. - The dogs are dressed as foxes.

00:38:08.060 --> 00:38:10.700
 - The cranes are dressed, who's the cranes dressed as?

00:38:10.700 --> 00:38:12.100
 They're all dressed as the Pope.

00:38:12.100 --> 00:38:14.140
 (audience laughing)

00:38:14.140 --> 00:38:16.820
 - Is the weirdest nativity ever, isn't it?

00:38:16.820 --> 00:38:17.660
 - They're amazing.

00:38:17.660 --> 00:38:18.780
 But they're back in the UK.

00:38:18.780 --> 00:38:20.460
 This is a huge victory for conservation.

00:38:20.460 --> 00:38:24.300
 They are the first crane egg laid in Britain

00:38:24.300 --> 00:38:27.940
 since about the year 1600 was in 2013.

00:38:27.940 --> 00:38:31.220
 And it was given a 24 hour guard 'cause it was so precious.

00:38:31.220 --> 00:38:34.100
 And now the numbers are rising in the UK

00:38:34.100 --> 00:38:35.980
 and it's a huge success story, so it's really good.

00:38:35.980 --> 00:38:36.820
 - Yes, great.

00:38:36.820 --> 00:38:38.740
 - They've done a fabulous job on it.

00:38:38.740 --> 00:38:40.700
 - Yeah, amazing. - It's a hooray for Chris Crow.

00:38:40.700 --> 00:38:43.460
 (audience cheering)

00:38:43.460 --> 00:38:46.100
 - Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show

00:38:46.100 --> 00:38:47.700
 and that is James.

00:38:47.700 --> 00:38:50.460
 - Okay, my fact this week is that Bill Gates

00:38:50.460 --> 00:38:55.300
 is responsible for putting chips in up to 80% of Americans.

00:38:55.300 --> 00:38:56.980
 (audience laughing)

00:38:56.980 --> 00:38:57.820
 - You're right.

00:38:57.820 --> 00:38:59.900
 Get to that quiet zone in America, James,

00:38:59.900 --> 00:39:00.860
 where you belong.

00:39:00.860 --> 00:39:02.860
 - What websites have you been on, James?

00:39:02.860 --> 00:39:05.620
 - Well, I learned this fact from an anonymous video

00:39:05.620 --> 00:39:06.980
 posted on Facebook.

00:39:06.980 --> 00:39:09.100
 (audience laughing)

00:39:09.100 --> 00:39:09.940
 - No, of course not.

00:39:09.940 --> 00:39:12.700
 - That's why I got the Pope helicopter thing.

00:39:12.700 --> 00:39:13.860
 - No, of course not.

00:39:13.860 --> 00:39:15.620
 So this is a story from a few years ago

00:39:15.620 --> 00:39:18.100
 that Bill Gates has bought up hundreds and thousands

00:39:18.100 --> 00:39:20.500
 of acres of land in America.

00:39:20.500 --> 00:39:22.900
 On that land, he grows potatoes.

00:39:22.900 --> 00:39:25.220
 He sells those potatoes to McDonald's

00:39:25.220 --> 00:39:26.540
 and they sell chips

00:39:26.540 --> 00:39:28.740
 and Americans put them in their face holes.

00:39:28.740 --> 00:39:33.740
 And so 80% of Americans up to have got chips from Bill Gates.

00:39:33.740 --> 00:39:35.180
 - So good.

00:39:35.180 --> 00:39:38.340
 (audience applauding)

00:39:38.340 --> 00:39:39.180
 - There we go.

00:39:39.180 --> 00:39:40.020
 - Yeah, it's incredible.

00:39:40.020 --> 00:39:41.340
 - And of course he does it in the vaccines.

00:39:41.340 --> 00:39:43.220
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:39:43.220 --> 00:39:44.060
 - Thank you.

00:39:44.060 --> 00:39:44.900
 - Yeah.

00:39:44.900 --> 00:39:45.740
 (audience laughing)

00:39:45.740 --> 00:39:49.740
 But yeah, he's one of the few people in the world

00:39:49.740 --> 00:39:52.980
 who has a McDonald's gold card.

00:39:52.980 --> 00:39:54.460
 And I don't know if it's connected to this.

00:39:54.460 --> 00:39:55.300
 - What's that?

00:39:55.300 --> 00:39:57.420
 - McDonald's gold card is where you can go

00:39:57.420 --> 00:39:59.220
 to any McDonald's, you hand it in,

00:39:59.220 --> 00:40:00.540
 and no matter what you've ordered,

00:40:00.540 --> 00:40:01.860
 they give it to you for free.

00:40:01.860 --> 00:40:02.780
 - Oh, thank God.

00:40:02.780 --> 00:40:03.980
 'Cause otherwise, how would he be able

00:40:03.980 --> 00:40:05.220
 to afford a Big Mac?

00:40:05.220 --> 00:40:06.900
 (audience laughing)

00:40:06.900 --> 00:40:08.660
 - Well, they do that, so we don't have it in the UK.

00:40:08.660 --> 00:40:11.060
 What we have is the Nando's Black Card,

00:40:11.060 --> 00:40:12.540
 which is quite a famous card,

00:40:12.540 --> 00:40:14.260
 which I've experienced a couple of times.

00:40:14.260 --> 00:40:16.140
 It's like, I have, yeah.

00:40:16.140 --> 00:40:17.380
 Couple of friends of mine have had it.

00:40:17.380 --> 00:40:21.660
 So Tom Davis, who is a King Gary, he once had it.

00:40:21.660 --> 00:40:22.500
 He applied for it.

00:40:22.500 --> 00:40:24.260
 He got brought in front of the chicken council.

00:40:24.260 --> 00:40:25.100
 - Stop.

00:40:25.100 --> 00:40:25.940
 - Yeah, no, stop.

00:40:25.940 --> 00:40:27.820
 And he had to, are they dressed as chickens?

00:40:27.820 --> 00:40:30.740
 Or are they, had he had to make his case

00:40:30.740 --> 00:40:31.580
 to the chicken council?

00:40:31.580 --> 00:40:34.100
 - First of all, he stands behind the chicken,

00:40:34.100 --> 00:40:35.140
 (audience laughing)

00:40:35.140 --> 00:40:36.780
 caresses the thigh.

00:40:36.780 --> 00:40:40.100
 (audience laughing)

00:40:40.100 --> 00:40:41.380
 - And then I had another friend who,

00:40:41.380 --> 00:40:44.340
 and bear in mind, like, Ant and Deck had to share one.

00:40:44.340 --> 00:40:45.860
 That's the story going on.

00:40:45.860 --> 00:40:46.700
 - It's so nice.

00:40:46.700 --> 00:40:47.540
 - He's a hell of a rare, the Black Card.

00:40:47.540 --> 00:40:48.380
 - They go everywhere together.

00:40:48.380 --> 00:40:49.220
 What's the point of giving them two?

00:40:49.220 --> 00:40:50.060
 - Yeah, there's no part giving them two.

00:40:50.060 --> 00:40:50.900
 - Yeah, that's true, yeah.

00:40:50.900 --> 00:40:51.860
 - Well, that's what keeps them together,

00:40:51.860 --> 00:40:53.300
 is just the Black Nando's card.

00:40:53.300 --> 00:40:55.300
 They've hated each other 20 years.

00:40:55.300 --> 00:40:58.020
 - But so, he has this gold card,

00:40:58.020 --> 00:41:00.380
 and only quite a few Americans have it,

00:41:00.380 --> 00:41:01.220
 the McDonald's card.

00:41:01.220 --> 00:41:02.460
 - I think it's not related.

00:41:02.460 --> 00:41:04.340
 I think that's just because he's really rich.

00:41:04.340 --> 00:41:05.180
 - Fair enough.

00:41:05.180 --> 00:41:06.500
 - Oh. - Fair enough.

00:41:06.500 --> 00:41:09.060
 - He gets involved in some funny old games, doesn't he?

00:41:09.060 --> 00:41:11.020
 'Cause since he became the richest man in the world,

00:41:11.020 --> 00:41:12.620
 and then started, he just started investing

00:41:12.620 --> 00:41:14.020
 in lots of things, but also, obviously,

00:41:14.020 --> 00:41:16.540
 huge amounts of, you know, very worthy stuff,

00:41:16.540 --> 00:41:19.500
 and trying to beat malaria and this kind of thing.

00:41:19.500 --> 00:41:24.500
 In 2009, he paid $50 million to circumcise 650,000 men.

00:41:24.500 --> 00:41:27.020
 (audience laughing)

00:41:27.020 --> 00:41:29.180
 - Okay, you gotta give that some context.

00:41:29.180 --> 00:41:31.180
 Otherwise, it feels like it's not fair on him.

00:41:31.180 --> 00:41:33.780
 - It was a project attempting to curb HIV,

00:41:33.780 --> 00:41:36.220
 because there are studies, some studies that show

00:41:36.220 --> 00:41:38.860
 that circumcision lowers the risk of becoming infected,

00:41:38.860 --> 00:41:39.980
 and he funded the program.

00:41:39.980 --> 00:41:41.620
 - Ah, so he wasn't literally there.

00:41:41.620 --> 00:41:43.340
 - No, he insisted, that's part of it.

00:41:43.340 --> 00:41:44.580
 He said, "I'm gonna give you $50 million,

00:41:44.580 --> 00:41:45.940
 "but I wanna do them all myself."

00:41:45.940 --> 00:41:48.220
 (audience laughing)

00:41:48.220 --> 00:41:49.940
 And he asked to keep them.

00:41:49.940 --> 00:41:50.940
 It was weird.

00:41:50.940 --> 00:41:52.500
 Yeah.

00:41:52.500 --> 00:41:55.340
 He was, there were a lot of protests against this.

00:41:55.340 --> 00:41:56.180
 - Yeah.

00:41:56.180 --> 00:41:58.260
 - I mean, various people saying this is not the way

00:41:58.260 --> 00:42:00.580
 to defeat HIV or AIDS, and also,

00:42:00.580 --> 00:42:04.940
 the Canadian Foreskin Awareness Project got in touch,

00:42:04.940 --> 00:42:06.660
 and they campaigned against him saying,

00:42:06.660 --> 00:42:09.100
 "No one on earth is more detrimental to Foreskin

00:42:09.100 --> 00:42:10.220
 "than Bill Gates."

00:42:10.220 --> 00:42:12.060
 (audience laughing)

00:42:12.060 --> 00:42:14.180
 They called him Foreskin Enemy Number One.

00:42:14.180 --> 00:42:15.020
 (audience laughing)

00:42:15.020 --> 00:42:16.900
 Yeah, it was incredible.

00:42:16.900 --> 00:42:19.740
 Their leader is a charismatic man called Glenn Callender.

00:42:19.740 --> 00:42:21.700
 He challenged Bill Gates, right,

00:42:21.700 --> 00:42:23.260
 'cause Bill Gates was paying for this thing.

00:42:23.260 --> 00:42:25.660
 He said, "If you put Bill Gates in a four-by-four

00:42:25.660 --> 00:42:29.660
 "meter room with me and my Foreskin for exactly 44 minutes,

00:42:29.660 --> 00:42:32.380
 "he will emerge convinced that the circumcision is wrong."

00:42:32.380 --> 00:42:34.940
 - I would like to see him put in a room with him,

00:42:34.940 --> 00:42:36.460
 but his Foreskin isn't in that room.

00:42:36.460 --> 00:42:37.300
 (audience laughing)

00:42:37.300 --> 00:42:38.140
 How do you do that?

00:42:38.140 --> 00:42:40.020
 (audience laughing)

00:42:40.020 --> 00:42:42.340
 Have to be through a letterbox or something.

00:42:42.340 --> 00:42:43.180
 - Yeah.

00:42:43.180 --> 00:42:44.020
 - Wow.

00:42:44.020 --> 00:42:44.860
 - Anyway, he's a hero.

00:42:44.860 --> 00:42:45.700
 - Yeah.

00:42:45.700 --> 00:42:46.540
 - Foreskin Awareness Project.

00:42:46.540 --> 00:42:47.380
 - No, you're aware.

00:42:47.380 --> 00:42:48.220
 - Yeah.

00:42:48.220 --> 00:42:49.060
 - Yeah, I am aware.

00:42:49.060 --> 00:42:52.500
 He was asked about the potato farms on Reddit,

00:42:52.500 --> 00:42:54.300
 'cause they said, "Is this part of your climate push?"

00:42:54.300 --> 00:42:56.940
 And he was saying, "No, no, it's just part of investment,"

00:42:56.940 --> 00:42:59.060
 'cause he's made so much money outside of Microsoft.

00:42:59.060 --> 00:43:01.580
 Microsoft is obviously a big part of his wealth,

00:43:01.580 --> 00:43:03.660
 but a huge amount really is the other investments,

00:43:03.660 --> 00:43:05.980
 and it's someone else who does the investing for him,

00:43:05.980 --> 00:43:08.860
 so he has what he calls the Gateskeeper,

00:43:08.860 --> 00:43:09.700
 who is someone--

00:43:09.700 --> 00:43:10.540
 - Brilliant.

00:43:10.540 --> 00:43:15.540
 - Yeah, who turned, so there was $5 billion that he had,

00:43:15.540 --> 00:43:18.860
 which turned it to $82 billion in the time

00:43:18.860 --> 00:43:20.140
 that this guy has made investments.

00:43:20.140 --> 00:43:22.180
 So all these different companies and stuff.

00:43:22.180 --> 00:43:24.220
 - Easier, isn't it, when you're starting with $5 billion?

00:43:24.220 --> 00:43:25.060
 Let's face it.

00:43:25.060 --> 00:43:25.900
 (audience laughing)

00:43:25.900 --> 00:43:27.220
 - Yeah, that's true.

00:43:27.220 --> 00:43:29.060
 His farm is 100 Circles Farm,

00:43:29.060 --> 00:43:31.860
 or one of the farms that he has is 100 Circles Farm,

00:43:31.860 --> 00:43:34.300
 I think is the one that supplies McDonald's.

00:43:34.300 --> 00:43:36.300
 And it's really cool in America, we don't have this,

00:43:36.300 --> 00:43:38.260
 but when you look at America from above,

00:43:38.260 --> 00:43:41.900
 from the ISS, in fact, the farms are all circles, aren't they?

00:43:41.900 --> 00:43:45.740
 In that particular, I think it's like a Great Plains area,

00:43:45.740 --> 00:43:47.780
 then it's perfect circles.

00:43:47.780 --> 00:43:49.820
 It looks like giant crop circles,

00:43:49.820 --> 00:43:53.460
 and it's just completely transformed American farming,

00:43:53.460 --> 00:43:54.380
 I think, when it happened.

00:43:54.380 --> 00:43:55.980
 It's basically center pivot irrigation,

00:43:55.980 --> 00:43:58.060
 which is like when you get one of those things

00:43:58.060 --> 00:44:00.660
 in your garden that spins around in a tiny garden,

00:44:00.660 --> 00:44:03.260
 it's like a giant, giant version of that.

00:44:03.260 --> 00:44:05.820
 And yeah, it basically transformed

00:44:05.820 --> 00:44:09.540
 a completely unfertil, useless bit of land into McDonald's.

00:44:09.540 --> 00:44:11.060
 - It is amazing when you fly over it.

00:44:11.060 --> 00:44:13.020
 And they reckon that, okay,

00:44:13.020 --> 00:44:14.380
 that it's not the climate change thing,

00:44:14.380 --> 00:44:16.500
 but he is saying that he's financing them

00:44:16.500 --> 00:44:18.940
 to find more productive seeds,

00:44:18.940 --> 00:44:21.220
 and try and improve agriculture

00:44:21.220 --> 00:44:22.940
 to maybe help people to farm in Africa.

00:44:22.940 --> 00:44:24.780
 That's one of his excuses.

00:44:24.780 --> 00:44:25.860
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:44:25.860 --> 00:44:27.060
 Do you know this isn't the first time

00:44:27.060 --> 00:44:28.980
 that he's worked with French fries?

00:44:28.980 --> 00:44:29.820
 - Okay.

00:44:29.820 --> 00:44:33.380
 - In the '90s, he, do you remember Microsoft?

00:44:33.380 --> 00:44:35.580
 Bob, the little system.

00:44:35.580 --> 00:44:36.420
 - Oh, yeah.

00:44:36.420 --> 00:44:38.620
 - Bob was a disaster of a product.

00:44:38.620 --> 00:44:39.940
 It was meant to be something

00:44:39.940 --> 00:44:42.180
 that hand walked you through every single moment,

00:44:42.180 --> 00:44:44.060
 and Clippy was invented for it.

00:44:44.060 --> 00:44:46.180
 - Was it like, it was like a room or something,

00:44:46.180 --> 00:44:47.780
 and you clicked on a little bit,

00:44:47.780 --> 00:44:49.460
 and it would take you to the word process,

00:44:49.460 --> 00:44:50.860
 and you click there and it takes you somewhere else.

00:44:50.860 --> 00:44:51.700
 Is that right?

00:44:51.700 --> 00:44:53.340
 - Exactly, and there was a dog called Rover,

00:44:53.340 --> 00:44:55.580
 and there was Comic Sans was created for it.

00:44:55.580 --> 00:44:57.380
 We've mentioned it on the podcast before.

00:44:57.380 --> 00:44:58.980
 - This is actually giving me no impression

00:44:58.980 --> 00:45:01.860
 of exactly what it was, but--

00:45:01.860 --> 00:45:03.180
 - It was just a very easy way

00:45:03.180 --> 00:45:05.980
 to navigate basically Microsoft Windows,

00:45:05.980 --> 00:45:07.980
 and the leaders on that project,

00:45:07.980 --> 00:45:09.060
 on that failed project,

00:45:09.060 --> 00:45:12.380
 was two people called French and Fries.

00:45:12.380 --> 00:45:13.220
 - No.

00:45:13.220 --> 00:45:14.060
 - Oh, yeah.

00:45:14.060 --> 00:45:17.780
 So Melinda French, who then became Melinda Gates,

00:45:17.780 --> 00:45:20.740
 his now ex-wife, and Karen Fries,

00:45:20.740 --> 00:45:22.540
 who was the leader on the project,

00:45:22.540 --> 00:45:24.860
 and yeah, so yeah, it's really cool.

00:45:24.860 --> 00:45:26.980
 - Do we know if that's what inspired him

00:45:26.980 --> 00:45:29.460
 to do the whole McDonald's thing 40 years later?

00:45:29.460 --> 00:45:30.740
 - He's not commented, no.

00:45:30.740 --> 00:45:33.060
 You can do, when you've got Gates money,

00:45:33.060 --> 00:45:34.580
 you can do whatever weird shit you like.

00:45:34.580 --> 00:45:37.420
 So in 2016, he offered 100,000 chickens

00:45:37.420 --> 00:45:39.420
 to various countries, including Bolivia,

00:45:39.420 --> 00:45:43.220
 and he got a rare refusal.

00:45:43.220 --> 00:45:45.060
 - Ouch. - Yeah, Bolivia said,

00:45:45.060 --> 00:45:47.820
 we breed 195 million chickens a year.

00:45:47.820 --> 00:45:49.940
 We do not need a share of 100,000 chickens

00:45:49.940 --> 00:45:51.220
 that Bill Gates is providing us.

00:45:51.220 --> 00:45:52.700
 This is incredibly patronizing.

00:45:52.700 --> 00:45:53.700
 - I don't know.

00:45:53.700 --> 00:45:55.940
 That's kind of locking the gift chicken in the mouth,

00:45:55.940 --> 00:45:56.780
 isn't it?

00:45:56.780 --> 00:45:58.820
 - Well, you know, I kind of understand.

00:45:58.820 --> 00:46:01.020
 If you've got that many chickens already, it feels like.

00:46:01.020 --> 00:46:03.620
 - Yeah, okay, I want to have a chicken.

00:46:03.620 --> 00:46:06.420
 Has anyone seen, this is about Microsoft,

00:46:06.420 --> 00:46:08.620
 and it's something that our colleague,

00:46:08.620 --> 00:46:09.820
 Alex, showed me recently,

00:46:09.820 --> 00:46:12.580
 but if you have an hour and you're,

00:46:12.580 --> 00:46:14.260
 so you've never been more bored in your life

00:46:14.260 --> 00:46:16.500
 and you've watched everything else on television,

00:46:16.500 --> 00:46:20.020
 it's the Windows 95 instructional video.

00:46:20.020 --> 00:46:21.540
 Have you seen this? It's a sitcom.

00:46:21.540 --> 00:46:23.940
 - Oh, it's a sitcom, really?

00:46:23.940 --> 00:46:26.980
 - But the Microsoft guys wrote it,

00:46:26.980 --> 00:46:28.940
 and it stars at the height,

00:46:28.940 --> 00:46:30.020
 as their fame was just starting,

00:46:30.020 --> 00:46:31.700
 Jennifer Aniston and Matthew Perry.

00:46:31.700 --> 00:46:32.540
 - No.

00:46:32.540 --> 00:46:34.420
 - Basically, as Rachel and Chandler,

00:46:34.420 --> 00:46:37.660
 it's like the most excruciating hour of your life.

00:46:37.660 --> 00:46:40.020
 Well, to be fair, the second half hour

00:46:40.020 --> 00:46:41.540
 is just like instructions for how to use it.

00:46:41.540 --> 00:46:43.700
 The first half hour is a script

00:46:43.700 --> 00:46:46.620
 that really makes your genitals shrivel back up

00:46:46.620 --> 00:46:48.780
 inside yourself as you're watching.

00:46:48.780 --> 00:46:52.500
 It's, I mean, there's some quite sleazy moments.

00:46:52.500 --> 00:46:54.420
 Well, quite a lot of people pervy on Rachel.

00:46:54.420 --> 00:46:56.340
 There's a classic line from Chandler.

00:46:56.340 --> 00:46:57.700
 They're ordering Chinese food,

00:46:57.700 --> 00:46:59.940
 and someone suggests they order Mushu pork.

00:46:59.940 --> 00:47:01.500
 Chandler says, "You know what's interesting

00:47:01.500 --> 00:47:02.900
 "about Mushu pork?

00:47:02.900 --> 00:47:04.660
 "It's only good when it's together."

00:47:04.660 --> 00:47:06.580
 'Cause moo, not good.

00:47:06.580 --> 00:47:08.940
 And shoo, definitely not good.

00:47:08.940 --> 00:47:10.900
 But Mushu, that's good.

00:47:10.900 --> 00:47:12.980
 (laughing)

00:47:12.980 --> 00:47:14.460
 - You made Dan laugh there, or something?

00:47:14.460 --> 00:47:16.340
 (laughing)

00:47:16.340 --> 00:47:17.460
 - I think it's on your level, actually.

00:47:17.460 --> 00:47:18.700
 - You might really like it.

00:47:18.700 --> 00:47:20.020
 - Classic Chandler.

00:47:20.020 --> 00:47:23.260
 (laughing)

00:47:23.260 --> 00:47:24.340
 - It's pretty painful stuff.

00:47:24.340 --> 00:47:25.820
 - Wow, never heard of that.

00:47:25.820 --> 00:47:27.460
 He was in "Frasier" as well.

00:47:27.460 --> 00:47:28.300
 - Was he?

00:47:28.300 --> 00:47:30.500
 - The second bit huge '90s sitcom.

00:47:30.500 --> 00:47:31.860
 He's apparently ruined.

00:47:31.860 --> 00:47:33.060
 (laughing)

00:47:33.060 --> 00:47:34.780
 - What we talked about on the episode was your--

00:47:34.780 --> 00:47:37.180
 - But I don't think we mentioned that on the episode,

00:47:37.180 --> 00:47:38.780
 actually, yeah, and he was like,

00:47:38.780 --> 00:47:40.420
 was he a fan of "Frasier" or something?

00:47:40.420 --> 00:47:43.860
 - He's a fan, and he turns up to do an interview with "Frasier",

00:47:43.860 --> 00:47:46.540
 but then people just call into the "Frasier" crane show

00:47:46.540 --> 00:47:49.460
 asking for technical support with Microsoft products.

00:47:49.460 --> 00:47:50.300
 It's pretty funny, actually.

00:47:50.300 --> 00:47:52.900
 - He did do that once, didn't he, in 1989,

00:47:52.900 --> 00:47:54.500
 when Microsoft, they weren't massive,

00:47:54.500 --> 00:47:56.060
 but they was getting pretty big.

00:47:56.060 --> 00:47:58.740
 And he was quite famous at that time.

00:47:58.740 --> 00:48:01.100
 He walked into a support facility,

00:48:01.100 --> 00:48:03.300
 and he just sat down, put the headphones on,

00:48:03.300 --> 00:48:05.420
 answered a call, "Hi, this is William.

00:48:05.420 --> 00:48:06.900
 "How can I help you?"

00:48:06.900 --> 00:48:09.980
 And sure enough, he managed to fix the problem

00:48:09.980 --> 00:48:11.540
 'cause he's Bill Gates.

00:48:11.540 --> 00:48:14.700
 And this is on a blog on the company's website,

00:48:14.700 --> 00:48:17.220
 so, you know, but apparently he was so good

00:48:17.220 --> 00:48:19.100
 that when the customer called back later,

00:48:19.100 --> 00:48:21.420
 they said, "I'd like to speak to that nice man

00:48:21.420 --> 00:48:24.700
 "called William, who straightened it all out."

00:48:24.700 --> 00:48:26.420
 - Well, why were they calling back?

00:48:26.420 --> 00:48:29.420
 (audience laughing)

00:48:29.420 --> 00:48:33.780
 - That's an excellent question.

00:48:33.780 --> 00:48:35.860
 - He stood out from a really early age,

00:48:35.860 --> 00:48:38.300
 his abilities, coding abilities.

00:48:38.300 --> 00:48:39.900
 Like, he was a super smart guy.

00:48:39.900 --> 00:48:42.220
 People often point out that he didn't get a university degree,

00:48:42.220 --> 00:48:45.260
 so hope for everyone, but he did go to Harvard

00:48:45.260 --> 00:48:48.020
 and was basically too smart to bother finishing

00:48:48.020 --> 00:48:49.820
 'cause he was starting to build his own company.

00:48:49.820 --> 00:48:51.820
 But when he was at school,

00:48:51.820 --> 00:48:53.540
 he went to one of the only schools in the area

00:48:53.540 --> 00:48:55.700
 which had its own computer, one computer.

00:48:55.700 --> 00:48:59.100
 And the teacher spotted he was super good at coding,

00:48:59.100 --> 00:49:01.700
 and so they asked him to write the school's computer program

00:49:01.700 --> 00:49:03.780
 to schedule all the students' classes

00:49:03.780 --> 00:49:05.060
 and put them all in the right classes.

00:49:05.060 --> 00:49:05.900
 - Wow.

00:49:05.900 --> 00:49:08.940
 - And so he modified, this is him age 15 or whatever,

00:49:08.940 --> 00:49:10.380
 maybe a precious thing's to come.

00:49:10.380 --> 00:49:13.620
 He modified the code in order that he was placed in classes

00:49:13.620 --> 00:49:16.280
 with a disproportionate number of interesting girls.

00:49:16.280 --> 00:49:17.580
 (audience laughing)

00:49:17.580 --> 00:49:19.780
 - Feels like interesting's not being used

00:49:19.780 --> 00:49:20.820
 in its traditional sense though.

00:49:20.820 --> 00:49:22.060
 (audience laughing)

00:49:22.060 --> 00:49:22.980
 Wow.

00:49:22.980 --> 00:49:26.500
 Actually, another, the school that just had one computer,

00:49:26.500 --> 00:49:28.140
 another kid once asked,

00:49:28.140 --> 00:49:30.100
 sort of tried to kick him off the computer,

00:49:30.100 --> 00:49:32.220
 and he said, "Okay, you can have it in 15 minutes."

00:49:32.220 --> 00:49:34.820
 (audience laughing)

00:49:34.820 --> 00:49:35.660
 - It's a keys joke, isn't it?

00:49:35.660 --> 00:49:36.820
 - It's a keys joke.

00:49:36.820 --> 00:49:38.060
 - It's good.

00:49:38.060 --> 00:49:40.300
 - You know, Microsoft Minesweeper,

00:49:40.300 --> 00:49:41.940
 any Minesweeper fans in?

00:49:41.940 --> 00:49:42.780
 - Oh yeah.

00:49:42.780 --> 00:49:43.620
 - Any wasted hours?

00:49:43.620 --> 00:49:44.440
 - Yeah.

00:49:44.440 --> 00:49:46.280
 - Minesweeper crew are in.

00:49:46.280 --> 00:49:48.620
 He, it was put on Windows in 1990

00:49:48.620 --> 00:49:50.300
 and everyone at Microsoft was addicted to it.

00:49:50.300 --> 00:49:52.720
 Everyone loved Minesweeper 'cause it's great.

00:49:52.720 --> 00:49:55.400
 And he uninstalled it from his computer,

00:49:55.400 --> 00:49:58.260
 but he was so addicted that he would sneak into

00:49:58.260 --> 00:50:00.380
 the vice president's office after work.

00:50:00.380 --> 00:50:01.220
 He was so addicted.

00:50:01.220 --> 00:50:02.340
 He had the company record.

00:50:02.340 --> 00:50:03.300
 He could do the beginner mode,

00:50:03.300 --> 00:50:04.540
 you know, it was a little like 10 by 10.

00:50:04.540 --> 00:50:05.380
 - Oh yeah.

00:50:05.380 --> 00:50:07.140
 - Beginner mode in five seconds.

00:50:07.140 --> 00:50:08.900
 - Can't you just luckily press someone

00:50:08.900 --> 00:50:10.180
 and they all just kind of,

00:50:10.180 --> 00:50:12.220
 just luckily is in the right place.

00:50:12.220 --> 00:50:13.660
 Occasionally you can do that.

00:50:13.660 --> 00:50:14.860
 I think if you get lucky.

00:50:14.860 --> 00:50:15.980
 - Five seconds is pretty good.

00:50:15.980 --> 00:50:16.820
 - Five seconds is amazing.

00:50:16.820 --> 00:50:19.140
 - But the firm's product manager was Bruce Ryan

00:50:19.140 --> 00:50:20.660
 and he wrote a computer script,

00:50:20.660 --> 00:50:22.780
 which could do it in four seconds.

00:50:22.780 --> 00:50:24.340
 And Bill Gates is not a good loser

00:50:24.340 --> 00:50:25.340
 because when that happened,

00:50:25.340 --> 00:50:27.420
 he sent out an email to all the staff saying,

00:50:27.420 --> 00:50:29.340
 "When machines can do things faster than people,

00:50:29.340 --> 00:50:31.300
 "how can we retain our human dignity?"

00:50:31.300 --> 00:50:32.620
 (audience laughing)

00:50:32.620 --> 00:50:35.660
 - Do you know he's only got one scientific paper

00:50:35.660 --> 00:50:38.660
 that is published under his name, Bill Gates.

00:50:38.660 --> 00:50:43.340
 And it's a possible solution to a mathematical problem

00:50:43.340 --> 00:50:45.660
 about flipping pancakes.

00:50:45.660 --> 00:50:46.620
 - Tell us more, Dan.

00:50:46.620 --> 00:50:47.740
 - Well.

00:50:47.740 --> 00:50:49.060
 - 'Cause this is quite complicated.

00:50:49.060 --> 00:50:51.500
 - It's so complicated that I was hoping

00:50:51.500 --> 00:50:53.980
 to just lob it your way and then bring it back.

00:50:53.980 --> 00:50:56.140
 But basically it is a mathematical problem,

00:50:56.140 --> 00:50:59.220
 which is very intense and it involves

00:50:59.220 --> 00:51:00.540
 how can you flip a number of things

00:51:00.540 --> 00:51:01.980
 that are out of order and make them flip.

00:51:01.980 --> 00:51:04.100
 - Yeah, so if you have a big pile of pancakes,

00:51:04.100 --> 00:51:05.740
 they're all different sizes,

00:51:05.740 --> 00:51:08.300
 and you can put your spatula under any one of them

00:51:08.300 --> 00:51:09.940
 and turn them upside down.

00:51:09.940 --> 00:51:12.900
 How many times can you do that so that when you're finished,

00:51:12.900 --> 00:51:14.100
 they start with the biggest one

00:51:14.100 --> 00:51:15.620
 and they end with the smallest one?

00:51:15.620 --> 00:51:16.460
 - Yeah.

00:51:16.460 --> 00:51:18.780
 - Okay. - And why are you doing this?

00:51:18.780 --> 00:51:20.340
 (audience laughing)

00:51:20.340 --> 00:51:22.060
 - I'll send that back over to you, Dan.

00:51:22.060 --> 00:51:22.900
 - Yeah.

00:51:22.900 --> 00:51:23.740
 (audience laughing)

00:51:23.740 --> 00:51:25.060
 - Are they sweet or savory?

00:51:25.060 --> 00:51:26.500
 (audience laughing)

00:51:26.500 --> 00:51:28.260
 - Sorry, back to James for that one.

00:51:28.260 --> 00:51:29.100
 (audience laughing)

00:51:29.100 --> 00:51:30.780
 - There is one version that they worked on

00:51:30.780 --> 00:51:33.260
 called the burnt pancake problem,

00:51:33.260 --> 00:51:35.900
 where, again, we don't know if they're savory or sweet,

00:51:35.900 --> 00:51:37.820
 but we know that on one side they're burnt,

00:51:37.820 --> 00:51:39.420
 and apparently that makes a big difference

00:51:39.420 --> 00:51:40.260
 to the problem.

00:51:40.260 --> 00:51:41.260
 - It certainly does make a big difference.

00:51:41.260 --> 00:51:42.180
 (audience laughing)

00:51:42.180 --> 00:51:43.580
 But not only are they the wrong size,

00:51:43.580 --> 00:51:44.860
 they're now burnt on one side.

00:51:44.860 --> 00:51:46.700
 I'm contacting the kitchen.

00:51:46.700 --> 00:51:48.740
 So he did this while he was at Harvard,

00:51:48.740 --> 00:51:50.460
 and the professor, he was one of the names

00:51:50.460 --> 00:51:51.580
 on the paper with a few other,

00:51:51.580 --> 00:51:53.220
 and it was a couple years before the paper

00:51:53.220 --> 00:51:54.780
 was accepted and published.

00:51:54.780 --> 00:51:56.620
 And he called Bill Gates, the professor,

00:51:56.620 --> 00:51:59.580
 and he said, "Good news, our pancake flipping paper

00:51:59.580 --> 00:52:01.940
 "has been accepted and it's gonna be published."

00:52:01.940 --> 00:52:04.640
 And he said, "Bill Gates seemed really disinterested

00:52:04.640 --> 00:52:06.180
 "in the fact that this was happening,"

00:52:06.180 --> 00:52:09.500
 and that he was now working in a company in New Mexico

00:52:09.500 --> 00:52:12.180
 that was writing code for microprocessors.

00:52:12.180 --> 00:52:14.320
 And the professor said, "I remember thinking,

00:52:14.320 --> 00:52:16.900
 "ah, such a brilliant kid, what a waste."

00:52:16.900 --> 00:52:20.700
 (audience laughing)

00:52:20.700 --> 00:52:21.540
 That's so good.

00:52:21.540 --> 00:52:23.740
 We're gonna have to wrap up and it's like, guys.

00:52:23.740 --> 00:52:25.420
 - Can I just study about his house quickly?

00:52:25.420 --> 00:52:26.260
 - Yes.

00:52:26.260 --> 00:52:28.660
 - Known as Zanadu 2.0.

00:52:28.660 --> 00:52:30.580
 - Oh, yes, it's a semi, isn't it?

00:52:30.580 --> 00:52:32.140
 Semi detached, three bed.

00:52:32.140 --> 00:52:33.100
 Yeah, it's nice.

00:52:33.100 --> 00:52:33.940
 - Very humble.

00:52:33.940 --> 00:52:35.900
 It's a shared garden, one of those.

00:52:35.900 --> 00:52:37.660
 Situations.

00:52:37.660 --> 00:52:39.860
 It's got, I just don't understand this,

00:52:39.860 --> 00:52:43.220
 it's got seven bedrooms and by one count,

00:52:43.220 --> 00:52:47.940
 18.75 bathrooms and by another count, 24 bathrooms.

00:52:47.940 --> 00:52:50.980
 It also has, well, according to a book hero in the '90s,

00:52:50.980 --> 00:52:54.380
 one of the elements of which was describing his ideal home,

00:52:54.380 --> 00:52:58.380
 it has guests get a badge when they enter that they wear

00:52:58.380 --> 00:53:00.500
 and they put in their temperature

00:53:00.500 --> 00:53:02.420
 and lighting preferences on their badge.

00:53:02.420 --> 00:53:04.780
 And then whenever you walk into a new room,

00:53:04.780 --> 00:53:07.260
 it automatically adjusts the temperature and lighting.

00:53:07.260 --> 00:53:08.460
 And I don't know what it does

00:53:08.460 --> 00:53:10.940
 if two of you walk into the room at the same time.

00:53:10.940 --> 00:53:12.140
 - That is, yeah.

00:53:12.140 --> 00:53:12.980
 - That's, oh my God.

00:53:12.980 --> 00:53:14.620
 - I would hack the badges to murder people

00:53:14.620 --> 00:53:15.940
 and that would be my plot.

00:53:15.940 --> 00:53:16.780
 - What?

00:53:16.780 --> 00:53:17.620
 - Why?

00:53:17.620 --> 00:53:18.460
 - Why?

00:53:18.460 --> 00:53:19.780
 (audience laughing)

00:53:19.780 --> 00:53:21.900
 - Who likes having guests, really?

00:53:21.900 --> 00:53:24.540
 (audience laughing)

00:53:24.540 --> 00:53:26.540
 I'd send it to 1,000 degrees.

00:53:26.540 --> 00:53:29.380
 (audience laughing)

00:53:29.380 --> 00:53:30.220
 - Yeah.

00:53:30.220 --> 00:53:31.740
 - A little paperclip turns up,

00:53:31.740 --> 00:53:33.900
 it looks like you're trying to kill, kill, kill.

00:53:33.900 --> 00:53:36.900
 (audience laughing)

00:53:36.900 --> 00:53:40.380
 Okay, that is it.

00:53:40.380 --> 00:53:41.900
 That is all of our facts.

00:53:41.900 --> 00:53:42.740
 Thank you.

00:53:42.740 --> 00:53:43.740
 (audience cheering)

00:53:43.740 --> 00:53:45.660
 Thank you so much, thank you.

00:53:45.660 --> 00:53:48.820
 (audience applauding)

00:53:48.820 --> 00:53:53.740
 Thank you, guys.

00:53:53.740 --> 00:53:54.580
 That is it.

00:53:54.580 --> 00:53:55.420
 That is all of our facts.

00:53:55.420 --> 00:53:57.100
 Thank you so much for listening.

00:53:57.100 --> 00:53:59.340
 If you would like to get in contact with any of us

00:53:59.340 --> 00:54:00.780
 about the things that we have said

00:54:00.780 --> 00:54:02.100
 over the course of this podcast,

00:54:02.100 --> 00:54:03.660
 we can be found on our Twitter accounts.

00:54:03.660 --> 00:54:05.860
 I'm on @Shriberland, Andy.

00:54:05.860 --> 00:54:07.420
 - @AndrewHunterM.
