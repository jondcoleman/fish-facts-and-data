00:00:00,00:00:02,"- Hi everyone, just before we start this show,"
00:00:02,00:00:05,we've got an incredibly exciting announcement to make.
00:00:05,00:00:08,"- It is so exciting, especially for people"
00:00:08,00:00:12,who like to watch live comedy podcast fact shows.
00:00:12,00:00:14,"- What a great description of our show, James."
00:00:14,00:00:16,It's like you've been rehearsing that for years.
00:00:16,00:00:20,"Yes, we are going on tour to do our comedy live podcast fact"
00:00:20,00:00:24,show. We are going all over the UK and Ireland
00:00:24,00:00:27,and we are then going to Australia.
00:00:27,00:00:29,- And then we are going to New Zealand.
00:00:29,00:00:31,- Indeed we are. When are we doing this?
00:00:31,00:00:34,"I hear you ask. Well, we are starting off going to Edinburgh"
00:00:34,00:00:36,to just perform the podcast in August.
00:00:36,00:00:39,"- Yes. And then we will go to Bristol, Dublin, Glasgow,"
00:00:39,00:00:42,"Newcastle, Cardiff, London, Manchester."
00:00:42,00:00:45,We'll play all those places in the UK and Ireland.
00:00:45,00:00:49,And then we are going down under in November.
00:00:49,00:00:52,- Is that your attempt at almost doing an Australian accent?
00:00:52,00:00:54,- I pulled out of it at the last second.
00:00:54,00:00:55,- I think that was a wise choice.
00:00:55,00:00:56,"- Well, we're going to go to Adelaide Perth,"
00:00:56,00:00:59,"Brisbane, Sydney, Melbourne, Auckland, Wellington"
00:00:59,00:01:02,"and Christchurch. But Anna, how do people get tickets?"
00:01:02,00:01:07,- They can go to knowsuchthingsafish.com/fishtour
00:01:07,00:01:10,where you'll find links to any venue that you want to attend.
00:01:10,00:01:11,Or why not come to all of them?
00:01:11,00:01:14,"- Why not? Indeed, I'll be at all of them."
00:01:14,00:01:15,- So will I.
00:01:15,00:01:17,"- So, dude, come along to the show."
00:01:17,00:01:18,It's going to be so much fun.
00:01:18,00:01:20,We can't wait to get back on tour.
00:01:20,00:01:22,Come to those gigs. Come and say hi.
00:01:22,00:01:24,We'll see you there.
00:01:24,00:01:25,- Okay. On with the show.
00:01:25,00:01:27,- On with the podcast.
00:01:27,00:01:45,"- Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish,"
00:01:45,00:01:49,a weekly podcast coming to you from the QI offices in Hoburn.
00:01:49,00:01:52,"My name is Dan Schreiber. I'm sitting here with James Harkin,"
00:01:52,00:01:54,Anna Tyshinski and Andrew Hunter Murray.
00:01:54,00:01:56,"And once again, we have gathered around the microphones"
00:01:56,00:01:59,with our four favorite facts from the last seven days.
00:01:59,00:02:02,"And in a particular order, here we go."
00:02:02,00:02:05,"Starting with fact number one, that is Anna."
00:02:05,00:02:08,"- My fact this week is that in 1974,"
00:02:08,00:02:13,thousands of swallows migrated over the Alps by train and plane.
00:02:13,00:02:16,- Wow. - But not automobile.
00:02:16,00:02:19,"- This is amazing. Yes, it was 1974."
00:02:19,00:02:22,And there was bad weather all over the Alps.
00:02:22,00:02:24,And this meant that insects were quite hard to find.
00:02:24,00:02:26,They were dying and not being born.
00:02:26,00:02:29,And the swallows were getting really hungry and cold.
00:02:29,00:02:31,And this meant that they couldn't fly very well.
00:02:31,00:02:35,"And bizarrely, it was the police in Zurich,"
00:02:35,00:02:39,who for some reason drew attention to this.
00:02:39,00:02:41,- This is a crime against nature.
00:02:41,00:02:42,"- Well, exactly. Yeah."
00:02:42,00:02:46,"Not too much crime in Zurich at the time, I guess."
00:02:46,00:02:47,And so they said...
00:02:47,00:02:48,(laughing)
00:02:48,00:02:51,- Quickly qualify that because it's a hot place these days.
00:02:51,00:02:52,- Yeah.
00:02:52,00:02:55,And so they said these swallows are having a bad time.
00:02:55,00:02:59,And this thing was organized to fly them over the Alps
00:02:59,00:03:02,"or take them by train and Swiss Air flew 10,000 of them."
00:03:02,00:03:03,"- Oh, how interesting."
00:03:03,00:03:04,"You see, when you said the fact,"
00:03:04,00:03:07,I thought it was like just a normal swallow
00:03:07,00:03:10,was flying along and then jumped on a train.
00:03:10,00:03:12,"You know, like sometimes animals jump on trains."
00:03:12,00:03:13,- Like pigeons. Yeah.
00:03:13,00:03:14,"- Oh, don't open this."
00:03:14,00:03:16,"- I know this was, I can't believe you've gone there."
00:03:16,00:03:18,"- Or on planes or something,"
00:03:18,00:03:20,but you're saying actual flights were put on.
00:03:20,00:03:21,"- Yes, sorry."
00:03:21,00:03:23,"- You can see, 'cause swallows, I guess, fly in formation."
00:03:23,00:03:23,"So if one goes on a train,"
00:03:23,00:03:25,I guess they'd all follow onto the train.
00:03:25,00:03:27,And that would just be a terrifying train journey
00:03:27,00:03:28,for a lot of passengers.
00:03:28,00:03:30,"But no, flights were put on."
00:03:30,00:03:31,Swiss Air put on lots of flights.
00:03:31,00:03:33,"And then lots more thousands, in fact,"
00:03:33,00:03:35,were taken under the Alps or through a tunnel through the Alps.
00:03:35,00:03:38,- Where do they go to swallows?
00:03:38,00:03:40,- They were going to the Mediterranean
00:03:40,00:03:41,to get a bit warmer.
00:03:41,00:03:44,"So they were flown to Nice, Marseille, Barcelona."
00:03:44,00:03:46,They got the train.
00:03:46,00:03:47,And yeah.
00:03:47,00:03:47,- It's very nice.
00:03:47,00:03:49,It's a very heartwarming story.
00:03:49,00:03:50,It's a lovely tale.
00:03:50,00:03:52,"And I learned it from a heartwarming place,"
00:03:52,00:03:55,which is a book that my mum got me years ago
00:03:55,00:03:57,called The Little Book of the Dawn Chorus.
00:03:57,00:03:59,"It's made of cardboard, and it's about 10 pages long."
00:03:59,00:04:02,And each page is a big picture of a bird.
00:04:02,00:04:04,"And then you press a button next to that picture,"
00:04:04,00:04:05,and it makes the noise of that bird.
00:04:05,00:04:07,- Isn't it a children's book?
00:04:07,00:04:09,Doesn't sound like a grown-up's book.
00:04:09,00:04:13,- I think children probably enjoy it for the most part.
00:04:13,00:04:15,- Are you getting all of your facts these days
00:04:15,00:04:16,from bedtime reading to your kid?
00:04:16,00:04:17,"You had ""Goodnight, Moon."""
00:04:17,00:04:19,"- You had ""Sweet Packets."""
00:04:19,00:04:20,"- ""Goodnight, Moon."""
00:04:20,00:04:21,"- Oh, yours was ""Goodnight, Moon."""
00:04:21,00:04:22,Sorry.
00:04:22,00:04:23,"- God, what was my ""Sweet Packets"" like?"
00:04:23,00:04:26,- You said you found a fact on the side of a sweetie
00:04:26,00:04:27,that you were--
00:04:27,00:04:28,"- Oh, my God."
00:04:28,00:04:30,- Your research has gone downhill a lot.
00:04:30,00:04:31,"- It's a bit ropey, isn't it, actually?"
00:04:31,00:04:32,Yeah.
00:04:32,00:04:36,- You do get birds going by ship all around the world.
00:04:36,00:04:36,- Okay.
00:04:36,00:04:39,- And that is more in what I thought the fact was.
00:04:39,00:04:41,"In the flying along, they get a bit tired,"
00:04:41,00:04:42,and they just sit on a ship for a while.
00:04:42,00:04:43,- No.
00:04:43,00:04:44,"- And then they go on the ship for a bit,"
00:04:44,00:04:45,and then they fly off again.
00:04:45,00:04:46,- That's clever.
00:04:46,00:04:49,- And we found out this because they put tracking signals
00:04:49,00:04:52,"on birds, and they went,"
00:04:52,00:04:54,"""Well, this one started going really slowly,"
00:04:54,00:04:57,"""and exactly in the same direction as that tanker"
00:04:57,00:04:58,"""that we know goes in this direction."""
00:04:58,00:04:59,- So funny.
00:04:59,00:05:01,"- And so, yeah, apparently it is quite common."
00:05:01,00:05:03,"If you get injured a little bit,"
00:05:03,00:05:06,or if you're flying along and you get to a bit of turbulence
00:05:06,00:05:08,"that you can't really fly through very well,"
00:05:08,00:05:10,"you might just drop down, go on a boat for a few days."
00:05:10,00:05:11,- That's so good.
00:05:11,00:05:12,- Nice.
00:05:12,00:05:13,- Fly off again.
00:05:13,00:05:16,- I saw a video the other day of it was either a hawker
00:05:16,00:05:19,"or an eagle is giant, and there's a guy who's gliding,"
00:05:19,00:05:22,and then it just perches on his frame
00:05:22,00:05:24,and just kind of like chills out for a second
00:05:24,00:05:26,to get a break and then goes off again.
00:05:26,00:05:28,It's the most insane footage.
00:05:28,00:05:28,- Do you think the hawk knows
00:05:28,00:05:30,that it's like a glider or whatever?
00:05:30,00:05:31,- I don't know.
00:05:31,00:05:33,- Or do you think it thinks it's a really big bird?
00:05:33,00:05:33,- Yeah.
00:05:33,00:05:37,"- In which case, do hawks also land on really big birds?"
00:05:37,00:05:39,- That was gonna be my next question.
00:05:39,00:05:43,"Do they have resting stations on like, yeah, a flock of birds?"
00:05:43,00:05:45,"- And there's a blue tit on the hawk,"
00:05:45,00:05:46,and then a butterfly on the blue tit.
00:05:46,00:05:47,- I guess you do that kind of
00:05:47,00:05:49,"when you're flying in formation, right?"
00:05:49,00:05:51,Because you're directly behind someone
00:05:51,00:05:53,and you're kind of hitching the lift
00:05:53,00:05:54,a little bit on the guy in front.
00:05:54,00:05:56,"- A bit, but if you did climb"
00:05:56,00:05:57,"onto the back of the guy in front,"
00:05:57,00:05:58,I think you'd be a noise.
00:05:58,00:06:00,"- There is a theory that would work,"
00:06:00,00:06:05,"which is if you had flights, let's say from London to Zurich,"
00:06:05,00:06:09,"there were 10 flights every day, whatever."
00:06:09,00:06:12,"If you were to get them all to go at the same time,"
00:06:12,00:06:14,"then you could have them flying behind each other,"
00:06:14,00:06:17,"like geese or like swallows or whatever,"
00:06:17,00:06:19,and that would save us loads and loads of fuel.
00:06:19,00:06:21,- That's so cool.
00:06:21,00:06:22,"- Oh, we're using the tailwind."
00:06:22,00:06:25,"- Yeah, you basically, well, there's no turbulence,"
00:06:25,00:06:26,it's like a slipstream.
00:06:26,00:06:27,"- Yeah, sorry, slipstream is what I mean."
00:06:27,00:06:29,We're using the literally less air in the way.
00:06:29,00:06:32,"- Yeah, and the only reason we don't do that"
00:06:32,00:06:34,is because people like Dan are scared of flying.
00:06:34,00:06:36,"- Yeah, I'm not on for it."
00:06:36,00:06:39,"If the one in front breaks hard, then I'm going back a bit."
00:06:39,00:06:42,"- If you put those air brakes on, that's okay."
00:06:42,00:06:43,"- But what if you just, what if we were,"
00:06:43,00:06:45,we arranged that all the sort of nervous people
00:06:45,00:06:47,"get to go in the front plane, so they're fine."
00:06:47,00:06:49,"- Oh, what if one of them, they're first?"
00:06:49,00:06:52,"- Oh, yeah, yeah, no, all right."
00:06:52,00:06:53,"- Well, the sleezers go at the back."
00:06:53,00:06:55,"- See, this is why it's not happening."
00:06:55,00:06:57,"This is why, because people can't get along."
00:06:57,00:06:58,- But apparently we have the technology.
00:06:58,00:06:59,- That's a great idea. - That's a great idea.
00:06:59,00:07:00,- It's a really good idea.
00:07:00,00:07:02,- You don't have to leave at the same time.
00:07:02,00:07:04,"- Yeah, that's a problem. - I think convenient,"
00:07:04,00:07:05,sometimes you want to leave at different times.
00:07:05,00:07:06,- I think it's great.
00:07:06,00:07:08,I think I might have mentioned this before.
00:07:08,00:07:10,"I would like it if you know when you're in,"
00:07:10,00:07:12,if you're sitting in traffic in a car.
00:07:12,00:07:14,"Right, technically, as soon as the light goes green,"
00:07:14,00:07:15,it should be fine for everyone
00:07:15,00:07:17,"to just jam on the accelerator to full, right?"
00:07:17,00:07:19,"- Yes. - Because as everyone accelerates,"
00:07:19,00:07:20,the gaps also accelerate to the same amount.
00:07:20,00:07:23,"- Yeah, yeah, but what about me reading my phone at the front?"
00:07:23,00:07:25,(all laughing)
00:07:25,00:07:26,- That's what's called a New York second.
00:07:26,00:07:28,"A New York, a New York second is the time"
00:07:28,00:07:30,between the lights going green
00:07:30,00:07:32,"and someone directly behind you beeping you,"
00:07:32,00:07:34,the second it goes green to get me to move.
00:07:34,00:07:38,"- Am I the only person who, when I'm sat second in line"
00:07:38,00:07:40,"and the other person hasn't noticed,"
00:07:40,00:07:42,"I don't beep and I'm just like,"
00:07:42,00:07:43,"you know what, I'm not gonna beep."
00:07:43,00:07:46,I'm gonna be a good citizen and I'm not gonna honk.
00:07:46,00:07:48,I'm gonna let them notice by themselves.
00:07:48,00:07:49,- How long does that last?
00:07:49,00:07:51,- Just for a friend. - Until it goes red again.
00:07:51,00:07:52,"- Yeah, I don't think-- - I'll just let them do it."
00:07:52,00:07:53,- I think you might be the only person.
00:07:53,00:07:55,- Are you doing it if someone's behind you as well?
00:07:55,00:07:56,- Yeah. - Wow.
00:07:56,00:07:57,"- No, I've never-- - Usually the person"
00:07:57,00:07:58,behind me will beep.
00:07:58,00:07:59,"- Exactly, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:07:59,00:08:01,So what you're doing is you're saving yourself
00:08:01,00:08:02,the effort of a beep because you know
00:08:02,00:08:03,that the person behind you will probably
00:08:03,00:08:04,get around to it. - I'm just following
00:08:04,00:08:05,the highway code.
00:08:05,00:08:10,"- You're not supposed to be-- - No, you're looking at your phone"
00:08:10,00:08:11,at the traffic light.
00:08:11,00:08:12,(laughing)
00:08:12,00:08:13,- That's not what you're supposed to use your heart for.
00:08:13,00:08:15,Tell people that lights have changed.
00:08:15,00:08:15,"- No, that's true."
00:08:15,00:08:17,"It's only if there's an imminent threat to life,"
00:08:17,00:08:18,"isn't it, that you're meant to--"
00:08:18,00:08:21,"- Yeah, to let someone know where you are as well."
00:08:21,00:08:21,"- Right, yeah, yeah."
00:08:21,00:08:23,- So you are letting them know where you are.
00:08:23,00:08:26,"You're saying, ""I'm here and I'm not happy about it."""
00:08:26,00:08:27,Birds.
00:08:27,00:08:29,- I feel like ab migration.
00:08:29,00:08:30,- What's that? - Ab migration.
00:08:30,00:08:31,- Ab migration.
00:08:31,00:08:33,It's basically when you're a bird
00:08:33,00:08:35,"and you're migrating from one place to another,"
00:08:35,00:08:37,but you accidentally join the wrong flock
00:08:37,00:08:40,and you just follow them to wherever they're going
00:08:40,00:08:43,and you end up in complete with the wrong part of the world.
00:08:43,00:08:45,"- Oh, so they don't realize there's not a halfway through."
00:08:45,00:08:46,"- No, until they get there."
00:08:46,00:08:47,"- Yeah, right."
00:08:47,00:08:48,"- Oh, shit."
00:08:48,00:08:49,- There's no one I can track here.
00:08:49,00:08:51,(laughing)
00:08:51,00:08:52,Does that really happen?
00:08:52,00:08:54,"- It does happen, yeah."
00:08:54,00:08:56,"- I, this is a very old fact,"
00:08:56,00:08:58,but I discovered it's not on our show.
00:08:58,00:08:59,So I'm just plopping it in our show
00:08:59,00:09:00,'cause it's something we all know.
00:09:00,00:09:02,"But in France, if your pet snail gets a train,"
00:09:02,00:09:03,it needs its own ticket.
00:09:03,00:09:06,It has to pay for a ticket and it costs seven euro.
00:09:06,00:09:07,- Seven euro.
00:09:07,00:09:10,"- Seven euro, which is, a dog is 20."
00:09:10,00:09:11,So--
00:09:11,00:09:12,- Do you think that's cheap?
00:09:12,00:09:13,"- Well, it depends where you're going to."
00:09:13,00:09:15,"But if you're going all the way from, you know,"
00:09:15,00:09:19,"niece to breast, seven euros is an absolute steal."
00:09:19,00:09:20,- But not for a snail.
00:09:20,00:09:23,"- Well, how long is it gonna take to walk?"
00:09:23,00:09:25,(laughing)
00:09:25,00:09:26,- I guess.
00:09:26,00:09:28,You're just so used to hearing about European trains
00:09:28,00:09:31,"being so cheap and amazing and, you know."
00:09:31,00:09:32,"Well, that's striking."
00:09:32,00:09:33,"I mean, especially 'cause if you've got a few snails,"
00:09:33,00:09:34,that'll rack up quite quickly.
00:09:34,00:09:36,"Well, what I'm confused about is one person"
00:09:36,00:09:37,is only allowed one animal.
00:09:37,00:09:38,So one animal per person.
00:09:38,00:09:40,"So, right, I think you're only allowed"
00:09:40,00:09:42,your favorite snail to come.
00:09:42,00:09:44,- You must be able to claim it's a wild snail.
00:09:44,00:09:45,If you just put the snail down next to you
00:09:45,00:09:46,"and say, ""It's nothing to do with me."""
00:09:46,00:09:47,(laughing)
00:09:47,00:09:49,"- Yeah, but then he gets kicked off for fair evasion"
00:09:49,00:09:51,and then you've lost your favorite snail.
00:09:51,00:09:52,"- He's like, ""Anna, Anna!"""
00:09:52,00:09:53,(laughing)
00:09:53,00:09:55,We've known each other for years!
00:09:55,00:09:56,(laughing)
00:09:56,00:09:57,"- Honestly, it's a different Anna."
00:09:57,00:10:00,(laughing)
00:10:00,00:10:02,"James, did you, sorry, I have to ask."
00:10:02,00:10:05,"When you just used the example of going from niece to breast,"
00:10:05,00:10:06,"was it 'cause in your head,"
00:10:06,00:10:07,"you were saying the words, ""Nice breast."""
00:10:07,00:10:08,(laughing)
00:10:08,00:10:10,"- Great question, great question."
00:10:10,00:10:11,- That's what I've assumed.
00:10:11,00:10:12,"You've just got nice breast,"
00:10:12,00:10:14,"nice breast going through your head at all times,"
00:10:14,00:10:16,"and you thought, ""I can use this."""
00:10:16,00:10:18,"- Genuinely, I thought of what is the most"
00:10:18,00:10:20,southeasterly town and what is the most
00:10:20,00:10:21,north-westernly town I could think of.
00:10:21,00:10:22,And that was it.
00:10:22,00:10:23,- Okay. - That is good.
00:10:23,00:10:24,"- Yeah, very strong."
00:10:24,00:10:25,- I have a link.
00:10:25,00:10:26,I have a link.
00:10:26,00:10:27,- Yeah.
00:10:27,00:10:28,"- Patricia Highsmith, the writer."
00:10:28,00:10:29,"- Oh, yeah. - Of the town of Mr. Ripley."
00:10:29,00:10:31,Didn't she keep pet snails?
00:10:31,00:10:33,"- I think she would turn up places with them in a handbag,"
00:10:33,00:10:35,and I think she would let them crawl around her.
00:10:35,00:10:37,- I think she hid some under her breasts
00:10:37,00:10:39,"when she was going from one country to another,"
00:10:39,00:10:40,so she didn't have to.
00:10:40,00:10:41,"- Yeah, exactly. - Really?"
00:10:41,00:10:42,"- Oh, there you go. - Her nice breasts."
00:10:42,00:10:43,So there we go. - Yeah.
00:10:43,00:10:44,- We've come full circle.
00:10:44,00:10:46,- There we are. - And we have my train.
00:10:46,00:10:48,- Birds and trains.
00:10:48,00:10:49,- Yeah.
00:10:49,00:10:51,- So Japanese trains.
00:10:51,00:10:53,What's the first thing you think?
00:10:53,00:10:53,- Fast.
00:10:53,00:10:54,- Shinkansen.
00:10:54,00:10:55,- Fast.
00:10:55,00:10:56,"- Exactly, you've all said the right thing."
00:10:56,00:10:57,- Fast. - On time.
00:10:57,00:10:58,"- Shinkansen, bullet train."
00:10:58,00:10:59,"No, no, no, stop."
00:10:59,00:11:00,- I know more.
00:11:00,00:11:02,"- Well, fair enough."
00:11:02,00:11:04,"There was a problem with the bullet trains, right?"
00:11:04,00:11:05,"They were very, they were fast."
00:11:05,00:11:06,That was great.
00:11:06,00:11:09,But they were causing these sonic booms
00:11:09,00:11:10,when they came out of tunnels
00:11:10,00:11:11,'cause they pushed the air ahead
00:11:11,00:11:13,"and like a cork out of a bottle,"
00:11:13,00:11:15,"the air just pops out really loud,"
00:11:15,00:11:16,hundreds of meters away.
00:11:16,00:11:17,It was so loud.
00:11:17,00:11:21,It was like miserable to live anywhere near these trains.
00:11:21,00:11:24,And they were on overhead wires as well.
00:11:24,00:11:26,"And then the chief engineer who was called A.G. Nakatsu,"
00:11:26,00:11:29,he was interested in owls and how owls move quietly
00:11:29,00:11:31,'cause owls have these little structures
00:11:31,00:11:33,on their feathers called fimbrii.
00:11:33,00:11:35,- They make like vortices and stuff.
00:11:35,00:11:37,"- Exactly, they break down the air"
00:11:37,00:11:39,into sort of micro-turbulances.
00:11:39,00:11:42,"And he said to his team, ""This is the future."""
00:11:42,00:11:44,And every Japanese train has an owl strapped to the front.
00:11:44,00:11:48,That's right.
00:11:48,00:11:49,It's very cruel.
00:11:49,00:11:51,"- And instead of a holland, they go, ""Whoo-hoo!"""
00:11:51,00:11:55,- So there are these wing grafts put on the trains
00:11:55,00:11:57,and then to deal with the train coming out of the tunnel
00:11:57,00:12:01,"and having the sort of cork popping sonic boom effect,"
00:12:01,00:12:02,he looked to kingfishers
00:12:02,00:12:04,'cause they dive into the water with no splash.
00:12:04,00:12:07,If you've ever seen a really slow image of a video
00:12:07,00:12:09,"of kingfishers just dive again, no ripple."
00:12:09,00:12:11,So he changed the body shape of the front of the train
00:12:11,00:12:14,"and they are quieter and they have less air resistance,"
00:12:14,00:12:16,"they use less energy, they cost less, they use less fuel."
00:12:16,00:12:18,"- You know what birds also do, fly."
00:12:18,00:12:20,So he could have put wings on it.
00:12:20,00:12:23,(all laughing)
00:12:23,00:12:25,"- Yeah, and it all came from that?"
00:12:25,00:12:26,- Very cool.
00:12:26,00:12:27,- All the trains are based on birds.
00:12:27,00:12:28,- Basically birds.
00:12:28,00:12:29,"- Oh, yeah."
00:12:29,00:12:32,"- In China, they have a tunnel"
00:12:32,00:12:35,that they're building at the moment for trains.
00:12:35,00:12:38,"It's 12 meters across this tunnel,"
00:12:38,00:12:41,"but due to the movement of the Earth's crust,"
00:12:41,00:12:44,it's shrinking and it's currently now
00:12:44,00:12:47,less than three meters across.
00:12:47,00:12:47,- What?
00:12:47,00:12:49,- Because the Earth's plates are squishing it together.
00:12:49,00:12:50,- Oh no.
00:12:50,00:12:52,- Isn't that amazing?
00:12:52,00:12:53,- That's incredible.
00:12:53,00:12:55,"- Hang on, so this is a train tunnel"
00:12:55,00:12:56,that was built 12 meters across.
00:12:56,00:12:58,- They're currently in the middle of building it.
00:12:58,00:13:01,"It was supposed to be ready to go in like next year,"
00:13:01,00:13:04,but they keep going back and it's smaller again.
00:13:04,00:13:04,- How can I be confusing?
00:13:04,00:13:06,Do you think you were unpunked or something?
00:13:06,00:13:08,"You were like, what is going on?"
00:13:08,00:13:09,This was massive.
00:13:09,00:13:10,- Are they gonna have to make the train
00:13:10,00:13:14,one of those very small novelty steam trains?
00:13:14,00:13:15,- Everybody off the big train.
00:13:15,00:13:20,Isn't that weird?
00:13:20,00:13:20,- That's so good.
00:13:20,00:13:22,"- And they put loads of concrete supports in,"
00:13:22,00:13:23,they just got smashed.
00:13:23,00:13:26,"- Yeah, 'cause these are tectonic plates."
00:13:26,00:13:27,- Are they moving that?
00:13:27,00:13:29,I didn't know bits of Earth were moving that fast.
00:13:29,00:13:31,"- Well, let me introduce you to Earthquakes."
00:13:31,00:13:32,- Nice.
00:13:32,00:13:33,- It's nice to meet you.
00:13:33,00:13:34,(laughing)
00:13:34,00:13:35,"- But this is, yeah, I mean,"
00:13:35,00:13:37,there are some parts of the Earth that are moving.
00:13:37,00:13:39,"I mean, this is not like moving."
00:13:39,00:13:40,You can't see it moving.
00:13:40,00:13:41,- And they're still sticking with it?
00:13:41,00:13:43,They're not just gonna get a new mountain.
00:13:43,00:13:44,- I think what they're gonna do at the moment
00:13:44,00:13:44,is they're just gonna wait
00:13:44,00:13:47,and hopefully it's gonna stop moving soon
00:13:47,00:13:49,and then they're gonna be able to build it.
00:13:49,00:13:50,- Wow.
00:13:50,00:13:51,"- Just predict, nearby."
00:13:51,00:13:52,"- Well, hang on, hang on, hang on."
00:13:52,00:13:54,- All they need to do is wait long enough
00:13:54,00:13:56,and then the movement will go so much
00:13:56,00:13:57,that the tunnel will--
00:13:57,00:13:58,- Start making itself.
00:13:58,00:14:00,"- It will reverse, exactly."
00:14:00,00:14:02,And it'll start getting bigger again.
00:14:02,00:14:03,'Cause all the concrete will have gone through
00:14:03,00:14:04,to the other side.
00:14:04,00:14:05,Do you see what I mean?
00:14:05,00:14:06,- That makes no more sense
00:14:06,00:14:08,with the accompanying hand gestures
00:14:08,00:14:10,that we can see than it does to the listener.
00:14:10,00:14:11,"- Okay, fine, fine."
00:14:11,00:14:14,- Do you know the Snowdon Mountain Railway?
00:14:14,00:14:16,"So for the broad listeners,"
00:14:16,00:14:18,there's Snowdonia is the highest mountain in Wales
00:14:18,00:14:20,"and has a train going up it,"
00:14:20,00:14:21,which is kind of famous
00:14:21,00:14:22,'cause it's a way you can cheat to get to the top.
00:14:22,00:14:24,But did you guys know that it was built in the 1890s
00:14:24,00:14:26,and it's very first trip.
00:14:26,00:14:27,All the trains on it crashed
00:14:27,00:14:29,and out to close immediately for a year.
00:14:29,00:14:30,"- Oh no, no."
00:14:30,00:14:31,- For a year.
00:14:31,00:14:33,"- Yeah, 1896."
00:14:33,00:14:34,So there were two trains
00:14:34,00:14:35,that went on this inaugural journey.
00:14:35,00:14:36,They got off the top of Snowdon.
00:14:36,00:14:39,One was released to go down.
00:14:39,00:14:40,They completely lost control.
00:14:40,00:14:42,The engine of it derailed
00:14:42,00:14:43,and the driver and the guy
00:14:43,00:14:45,"who was spooning coal into it or whatever,"
00:14:45,00:14:47,both leapt off it.
00:14:47,00:14:48,- Shuffling?
00:14:48,00:14:48,- Shuffling.
00:14:48,00:14:50,- Spooning coal.
00:14:50,00:14:53,We can't get the power it's so in.
00:14:53,00:14:54,Use the dessert spoon.
00:14:54,00:14:55,Stop with the teaspoon.
00:14:55,00:14:56,"- Oh, I thought differently."
00:14:56,00:14:59,I thought whether the conductor is in bed with coal.
00:14:59,00:15:02,Stop hugging that coal and get out here.
00:15:02,00:15:06,"- Yeah, look, I don't work in the rail industry."
00:15:06,00:15:06,- Stoking.
00:15:06,00:15:07,- Stoking.
00:15:07,00:15:09,The stoker and the driver
00:15:09,00:15:11,both threw themselves off the engine
00:15:11,00:15:13,just as it flew over a cliff
00:15:13,00:15:15,"and hulled down onto the, you know, ground below."
00:15:15,00:15:16,- Wow.
00:15:16,00:15:17,- A few hundred meters.
00:15:17,00:15:20,And then the carriage is careering down on its own.
00:15:20,00:15:20,"- Oh, my goodness."
00:15:20,00:15:21,- The rail.
00:15:21,00:15:22,So all these passengers are on the carriage.
00:15:22,00:15:25,"- But ahead, there's a point."
00:15:25,00:15:27,And there are five people strapped to the track.
00:15:27,00:15:30,(laughing)
00:15:30,00:15:31,"- There was actually, there was one,"
00:15:31,00:15:32,there was a one death
00:15:32,00:15:35,because there was one guy on the carriage
00:15:35,00:15:39,who saw the driver and stoker leap off the engine.
00:15:39,00:15:40,"So the guy in the carriage thought,"
00:15:40,00:15:42,"well, I better do that as well."
00:15:42,00:15:43,So he just threw himself out of the carriage
00:15:43,00:15:45,and sadly plummeted into his death.
00:15:45,00:15:46,"- I know it's a use in the one who died, right?"
00:15:46,00:15:48,- Whereas the rest of the carriages eventually slowed down.
00:15:48,00:15:50,"- Once they entered a tunnel,"
00:15:50,00:15:52,which gradually grew closer.
00:15:52,00:15:54,Riding them to a halt.
00:15:54,00:15:56,(upbeat music)
00:15:56,00:16:01,"- Okay, it is time for fact number two."
00:16:01,00:16:03,And that is Andy.
00:16:03,00:16:04,"My fact is that in 1827,"
00:16:04,00:16:06,a shop opened in Cincinnati
00:16:06,00:16:09,where the principal currency was time itself.
00:16:09,00:16:12,(laughing)
00:16:12,00:16:13,"- I'm just remembering,"
00:16:13,00:16:14,"we only let you do this fact, didn't we?"
00:16:14,00:16:16,Because we knew you would do that.
00:16:16,00:16:17,"- Yeah, we wanted to see. - We wanted to see."
00:16:17,00:16:18,"- Yeah, and you did."
00:16:18,00:16:19,- It's a good fact as well.
00:16:19,00:16:20,- Thank you.
00:16:20,00:16:22,This is a place called the Cincinnati Time Store
00:16:22,00:16:26,"and it was created by a guy called Josiah Warren,"
00:16:26,00:16:28,who was a utopian and a socialist.
00:16:28,00:16:31,"And he would now be described as an anarchist,"
00:16:31,00:16:33,but I don't think the phrase really existed at the time.
00:16:33,00:16:34,"Basically, his idea was,"
00:16:34,00:16:37,I'm going to sell things for what they cost me.
00:16:37,00:16:39,And the only thing I'm going to add to the price
00:16:39,00:16:43,is the value of the time I've spent on this stuff.
00:16:43,00:16:45,So he claimed basically labor
00:16:45,00:16:47,"was the only true currency, if you like."
00:16:47,00:16:50,- So it's like the time of people coming into the shop
00:16:50,00:16:51,"and deciding what to get,"
00:16:51,00:16:52,"the time of him wrapping it up,"
00:16:52,00:16:54,"the time of him weighing stuff,"
00:16:54,00:16:56,the time of him bringing stuff from the back room
00:16:56,00:16:57,"into the front light, all that kind of stuff."
00:16:57,00:16:59,"- All of that, and it involves quite a lot of calculation."
00:16:59,00:17:00,"And also, I love this,"
00:17:00,00:17:02,"the longer he spent with the customer,"
00:17:02,00:17:04,the more it would cost the customer
00:17:04,00:17:06,because his time was worth money.
00:17:06,00:17:08,- So if I'm behind that customer
00:17:08,00:17:10,"that's taking so much time,"
00:17:10,00:17:11,(laughing)
00:17:11,00:17:12,do I have to pay less or?
00:17:12,00:17:14,"- Yeah, they haven't noticed."
00:17:14,00:17:17,"You're in your car, do you honk your horn?"
00:17:17,00:17:18,Even though it's costing.
00:17:18,00:17:20,I think he had a timer dial
00:17:20,00:17:22,"so that as he stayed in the shop for ages saying,"
00:17:22,00:17:25,"""Oh, I don't know if I want the big one or the small one."""
00:17:25,00:17:28,"- Yeah, it's sort of notch up because this is his time."
00:17:28,00:17:29,- It actually seems more aggressive
00:17:29,00:17:32,"even though it's a utopian, cheapening thing."
00:17:32,00:17:35,- But he said that it went through so many customers
00:17:35,00:17:36,since such a quick amount of time
00:17:36,00:17:38,that he could shut the shop halfway through the day
00:17:38,00:17:40,because he'd done basically the full days
00:17:40,00:17:42,worth of money that he needed to earn.
00:17:42,00:17:43,"- Yeah, which is pretty nuts."
00:17:43,00:17:45,You can't do that with a shop.
00:17:45,00:17:47,What if I want to get to the shop at 3.30
00:17:47,00:17:48,and they've just closed at mid-dig?
00:17:48,00:17:50,"So they've gone, ""We've had enough customers for the day."""
00:17:50,00:17:51,"- Well, go to like a square capitalist shop"
00:17:51,00:17:54,and not to the utopian anarchist.
00:17:54,00:17:55,- That's fine.
00:17:55,00:17:56,"He was also, and I don't think"
00:17:56,00:17:57,"this is how he'd like to be characterised,"
00:17:57,00:17:59,but he was just like a modern day lawyer
00:17:59,00:18:01,"in the sense of time, wasn't he?"
00:18:01,00:18:02,- Yeah.
00:18:02,00:18:03,- 'Cause that's what you get with lawyers.
00:18:03,00:18:04,"The more time he spent with them,"
00:18:04,00:18:05,the more they charge.
00:18:05,00:18:06,You're having--
00:18:06,00:18:07,- And sex workers.
00:18:07,00:18:08,(laughing)
00:18:08,00:18:08,- And sex workers.
00:18:08,00:18:09,"So you've got to rush through both, haven't you?"
00:18:09,00:18:10,- I assume.
00:18:10,00:18:12,(laughing)
00:18:12,00:18:14,"Never used a lawyer, so I'm not sure if that's the same."
00:18:14,00:18:15,(laughing)
00:18:15,00:18:18,"For the first few days when he opened it,"
00:18:18,00:18:19,he didn't have a single customer.
00:18:19,00:18:20,- Really?
00:18:20,00:18:22,"- Yeah, and he asked his brother, George,"
00:18:22,00:18:25,to come and make some purchases for his family.
00:18:25,00:18:26,- Clever.
00:18:26,00:18:28,- And then George came and told his friends
00:18:28,00:18:30,and then George's friends came.
00:18:30,00:18:31,"And then in the first week,"
00:18:31,00:18:33,he'd made $5 worth of sales.
00:18:33,00:18:34,- Is that a lot?
00:18:34,00:18:36,"It was in the 18s, 20s, wasn't it?"
00:18:36,00:18:39,"- Even in those days, it wasn't enough to live off,"
00:18:39,00:18:42,but it took off relatively quickly after that.
00:18:42,00:18:45,"There was a guy who had another shop around McCona,"
00:18:45,00:18:46,"who kind of came in and said,"
00:18:46,00:18:48,"""You're putting me out of business, mate."""
00:18:48,00:18:49,- Yeah.
00:18:49,00:18:49,"- Oh, really?"
00:18:49,00:18:51,"- And he said, ""Well, maybe you could show me how to do it."""
00:18:51,00:18:53,"And Josiah Warren, so I said,"
00:18:53,00:18:55,"""Okay, well this is what I'm doing."""
00:18:55,00:18:56,And the guy copied his system.
00:18:56,00:18:59,- I think the idea is that time also
00:18:59,00:19:01,has a slightly variable value.
00:19:01,00:19:04,So nobody profits from anyone else's labor is the idea.
00:19:04,00:19:06,You don't get to just add a huge whack
00:19:06,00:19:08,to the amount of time you spend on something
00:19:08,00:19:10,because the time is the currency.
00:19:10,00:19:12,"But also, if a job is harder or more disgusting,"
00:19:12,00:19:14,I think it would be worth more time.
00:19:14,00:19:16,"So for example, I love making the show."
00:19:16,00:19:19,"So probably an hour and a half recording,"
00:19:19,00:19:21,I will actually only get paid half an hour of time
00:19:21,00:19:23,because it's so much fun to do.
00:19:23,00:19:25,- We're responding to the emails that people send in.
00:19:25,00:19:26,How much would you--
00:19:26,00:19:28,"- A quintuple, yeah, I'll make it back."
00:19:28,00:19:30,"- That's why I get paid five times as much as you, isn't it, Andy?"
00:19:30,00:19:32,I hate making this show.
00:19:32,00:19:34,"So two hours recording, I actually get paid."
00:19:34,00:19:36,- Do you know why that was the case?
00:19:36,00:19:39,"Because actually, this idea was not new."
00:19:39,00:19:41,But the reason that he had different amounts
00:19:41,00:19:43,of different people is because he'd previously been
00:19:43,00:19:47,in another utopia called New Harmony.
00:19:47,00:19:48,"And at New Harmony, that had failed"
00:19:48,00:19:52,because anyone who was good at like building houses
00:19:52,00:19:54,"just decided, wait a minute, I'm getting paid the same"
00:19:54,00:19:57,as the people who are doing something
00:19:57,00:19:58,which isn't skillful at all.
00:19:58,00:20:00,"And actually, it all fell apart because of that."
00:20:00,00:20:03,And so he decided that his new utopias and new ideas
00:20:03,00:20:05,were gonna be slightly different
00:20:05,00:20:06,and have a slightly different thing
00:20:06,00:20:09,where different skills paid different amounts.
00:20:09,00:20:11,- So he took over this small little town
00:20:11,00:20:12,called Modern Times.
00:20:12,00:20:14,- The place is called Modern Times.
00:20:14,00:20:16,"- It's called Modern Times, it's a name."
00:20:16,00:20:18,They had like 150 people who signed up
00:20:18,00:20:20,to the idea of living in this utopia.
00:20:20,00:20:22,- So that started off a bit dodgily
00:20:22,00:20:26,because he had this big group of people who were all utopians.
00:20:26,00:20:28,And then one of them began to advocate
00:20:28,00:20:31,for plurality of wives.
00:20:31,00:20:34,Another one believed that clothing was a superfluity.
00:20:34,00:20:36,So he didn't have to wear any clothes.
00:20:36,00:20:38,And there was another one who thought
00:20:38,00:20:40,"that actually you shouldn't really eat properly,"
00:20:40,00:20:42,you should just eat beans and nothing else.
00:20:42,00:20:43,- Oh no.
00:20:43,00:20:45,"- And yeah, it was basically attracted all these people"
00:20:45,00:20:48,who had all these different ideas outside of the mainstream.
00:20:48,00:20:50,"And at the very start, it went really badly"
00:20:50,00:20:53,and the newspapers were saying this is gonna be a disaster
00:20:53,00:20:55,but it did prosper in the end.
00:20:55,00:20:56,- Did it?
00:20:56,00:20:59,Even though it sounds like a load of farty naked sleazy men.
00:20:59,00:21:02,- They got rid of the farty ones and the sleazy ones.
00:21:02,00:21:03,- Okay.
00:21:03,00:21:05,- They got rid of the dwarfs.
00:21:05,00:21:07,(all laughing)
00:21:07,00:21:08,And then in the end it did falter
00:21:08,00:21:11,but it was because there was a huge panic
00:21:11,00:21:15,in the mid-19th century and then the civil war
00:21:15,00:21:16,and then that was where it fell apart.
00:21:16,00:21:17,- Yeah.
00:21:17,00:21:20,"But it did according to their like press, you know,"
00:21:20,00:21:22,it went for 13 years solidly.
00:21:22,00:21:24,"They didn't have government, they didn't have law,"
00:21:24,00:21:28,"no police, but they didn't have any reported crime or violence."
00:21:28,00:21:29,"- Well, if you've got no law,"
00:21:29,00:21:31,you're not gonna have any reported crime.
00:21:31,00:21:33,"- Yeah, that's just from supposedly the people."
00:21:33,00:21:35,- A naked man stole my third wife.
00:21:35,00:21:38,(all laughing)
00:21:38,00:21:41,"- Josiah Warren also invented a lamp, time lamp."
00:21:41,00:21:44,Just a non-time lamp.
00:21:44,00:21:45,"It burned over time, but again,"
00:21:45,00:21:48,"it had a utopian idea at its core,"
00:21:48,00:21:49,which was to save people money.
00:21:49,00:21:51,So it was made of lard instead of tallow
00:21:51,00:21:54,and it burned much more efficiently.
00:21:54,00:21:56,But the good thing about this lamp
00:21:56,00:21:59,is that the patent for it was destroyed
00:21:59,00:22:03,in a fire at the patent factory in 1836.
00:22:03,00:22:04,- That's very funny.
00:22:04,00:22:07,Isn't that true of like the fire extinguisher?
00:22:07,00:22:09,"- That's correct, it's the same fire."
00:22:09,00:22:09,- It was the same fire.
00:22:09,00:22:12,"- Well, it was this huge, it was an incredibly famous fire"
00:22:12,00:22:14,"and there are these things called the ex patents,"
00:22:14,00:22:16,"which are the first 10,000 patents."
00:22:16,00:22:18,"And I know I should be saying patents, sorry,"
00:22:18,00:22:21,"but the first 10,000 patents ever issued"
00:22:21,00:22:23,"and they were all destroyed in this fire,"
00:22:23,00:22:26,this massive fire at the US patent office.
00:22:26,00:22:28,- It feels like there's a good plot for a movie
00:22:28,00:22:30,or something in there where they're rediscovered
00:22:30,00:22:31,actually that we've made copies.
00:22:31,00:22:33,- Yeah. - Someone made copies
00:22:33,00:22:35,and all these new technologies turn up.
00:22:35,00:22:37,"- Yeah, the ex patent man."
00:22:37,00:22:38,"- Yeah, that's quite good."
00:22:38,00:22:39,- That's excellent.
00:22:39,00:22:42,"- He made a newspaper as well, Warren, in 1833."
00:22:42,00:22:44,"So a few years after the shop,"
00:22:44,00:22:46,for which he built his own printing press
00:22:46,00:22:48,and cast all the type himself.
00:22:48,00:22:50,"He does seem to have been very practical, practically minded."
00:22:50,00:22:53,- He also invented a new kind of music.
00:22:53,00:22:55,"- Did he, what was that?"
00:22:55,00:22:56,- Wrap.
00:22:56,00:22:58,(all laughing)
00:22:58,00:22:58,- Gangster rap.
00:22:58,00:23:01,"- No, it was called mathematical notation."
00:23:01,00:23:02,- Okay.
00:23:02,00:23:04,- And it was a way of using maths
00:23:04,00:23:07,as opposed to using do-re-mi-far-sol-r-t-do
00:23:07,00:23:08,was using numbers.
00:23:08,00:23:09,- How interesting.
00:23:09,00:23:12,He's described as an anarchist
00:23:12,00:23:15,and my impression of an anarchist is very different
00:23:15,00:23:18,to what it sounds like he was.
00:23:18,00:23:19,- What do you think of an anarchist?
00:23:19,00:23:21,"- I guess an anarchist would be someone who's raising hell,"
00:23:21,00:23:23,like suffragettes were being anarchists
00:23:23,00:23:25,when they were bombing places.
00:23:25,00:23:27,- And that's a metaphorical anarchist.
00:23:27,00:23:28,"- Yeah, right."
00:23:28,00:23:30,- An anarchist would be just someone who doesn't believe
00:23:30,00:23:33,there should be any leaders in society.
00:23:33,00:23:34,- Suffragettes are very much not anarchist
00:23:34,00:23:37,'cause they wanted to actively get into the role
00:23:37,00:23:39,"of electing leaders, yes."
00:23:39,00:23:40,- It's very weird.
00:23:40,00:23:42,"So anarchism is, 'cause everyone calls for an anarchist,"
00:23:42,00:23:45,"is this big school of thought, exactly as James says,"
00:23:45,00:23:47,"it's not, we don't want leaders,"
00:23:47,00:23:49,"no sort of state structures,"
00:23:49,00:23:51,people doing things for themselves and their neighbors
00:23:51,00:23:53,is the basic idea behind it.
00:23:53,00:23:55,But also there is a kind of extreme end of it
00:23:55,00:23:57,"in the 1890s, it was a big worry across Europe,"
00:23:57,00:24:01,"the anarchists, who were mostly basically young men"
00:24:01,00:24:03,"throwing these kind of like classic bombs,"
00:24:03,00:24:05,which are sort of big back black wool.
00:24:05,00:24:06,- Cherry bombs.
00:24:06,00:24:08,"- Yeah, with bomb written on the side"
00:24:08,00:24:09,and with a fuse sticking out of it
00:24:09,00:24:11,and throwing them at sort of elected leaders
00:24:11,00:24:13,or royals across Europe.
00:24:13,00:24:14,- Wiley Coyote.
00:24:14,00:24:17,"- Yeah, it is like that, but it was a genuine fear"
00:24:17,00:24:19,'cause that was the sort of extreme end of anarchism.
00:24:19,00:24:20,"But President William McKinley,"
00:24:20,00:24:22,"one of the four presidents assassinated,"
00:24:22,00:24:23,shot by an anarchist.
00:24:23,00:24:26,"And his assassin was a guy called Leon Chogosh,"
00:24:26,00:24:29,"who was, this is very dark, this,"
00:24:29,00:24:31,he was tried and executed.
00:24:31,00:24:35,And then his body was destroyed by acid
00:24:35,00:24:37,so that fellow anarchists wouldn't have a body to venerate
00:24:37,00:24:38,or to turn into a martyr.
00:24:38,00:24:41,So they literally poured acid into the coffin.
00:24:41,00:24:42,- Wow.
00:24:42,00:24:43,"- Put it in the coffin, close the coffin up,"
00:24:43,00:24:45,"pour acid in, and then burned all his clothes"
00:24:45,00:24:46,and possessions after that.
00:24:46,00:24:47,- Wow.
00:24:47,00:24:48,- I know.
00:24:48,00:24:49,- Don't do that again.
00:24:49,00:24:51,(laughing)
00:24:51,00:24:52,"- And then we get the sex pistols,"
00:24:52,00:24:55,"kind of calms down the world of Anarchy, doesn't it?"
00:24:55,00:24:56,- Yeah.
00:24:56,00:24:57,- The illusion of an anarchist.
00:24:57,00:24:58,"- If you buy it, if you buy a t-shirt of it,"
00:24:58,00:25:00,"it's not as anarchic as, yeah."
00:25:00,00:25:01,(laughing)
00:25:01,00:25:05,- I was looking into the idea of swapping money for time
00:25:05,00:25:07,and seeing if that's been used anywhere else.
00:25:07,00:25:08,"And I found an example,"
00:25:08,00:25:12,which is something that's been trialed in 2019 in Estonia.
00:25:12,00:25:13,They've had a huge problem with speeding drivers.
00:25:13,00:25:16,"So people are speeding, they're getting tickets,"
00:25:16,00:25:17,and then they are just paying the fine
00:25:17,00:25:19,because they can afford to do it.
00:25:19,00:25:20,"And so in Estonia, they thought,"
00:25:20,00:25:22,"instead of giving them a fine,"
00:25:22,00:25:24,what if anyone who's caught speeding
00:25:24,00:25:27,has to do a 45 to 60 minute timeout?
00:25:27,00:25:29,And now they're really late to where they need to go.
00:25:29,00:25:30,They have no choice but to do this.
00:25:30,00:25:31,- That's great.
00:25:31,00:25:32,- 57% of people actually said
00:25:32,00:25:35,they preferred the idea of having the timeout.
00:25:35,00:25:36,"So the biggest problem they have is,"
00:25:36,00:25:38,"- Meanwhile, James has pulled in behind the guy"
00:25:38,00:25:39,who's been stopped for speeding.
00:25:39,00:25:40,He doesn't mind.
00:25:40,00:25:42,(laughing)
00:25:42,00:25:46,- How are you policing that?
00:25:46,00:25:48,- This is what they're trying to work out
00:25:48,00:25:49,because it takes a lot of people
00:25:49,00:25:51,to have to sit there for an hour.
00:25:51,00:25:53,"It's not practical, but it's a great idea"
00:25:53,00:25:55,"because no matter how rich you are, time is time,"
00:25:55,00:25:57,you can't get past that.
00:25:57,00:25:58,"- It's not practical, guys."
00:25:58,00:25:59,"Well, what you could do is,"
00:25:59,00:26:01,you could put some clamps on the car
00:26:01,00:26:02,and so they can't go anywhere
00:26:02,00:26:03,and then come back an hour later and take it off.
00:26:03,00:26:06,"- But most speeders are called by cameras, aren't they?"
00:26:06,00:26:07,"Maybe out of every camera,"
00:26:07,00:26:11,it could drop a sort of big net that catches the car.
00:26:11,00:26:12,"- Yeah, that's much more practical."
00:26:12,00:26:14,"- Yes, I'm a craxit."
00:26:14,00:26:17,- Hiring some unemployed people to do the same work.
00:26:17,00:26:20,"Kind of like detention for grown-ups, basically."
00:26:20,00:26:23,- I have a related fact because it's about Estonia.
00:26:23,00:26:29,"I was in Estonia relatively recently, last year in Tallinn,"
00:26:29,00:26:32,and I went to the Museum of Banned Books.
00:26:32,00:26:33,"- Oh, cool, yeah."
00:26:33,00:26:35,"- So it's a museum, but it's also a shop."
00:26:35,00:26:38,You can buy books that have been banned from around the world.
00:26:38,00:26:40,And I asked for one particular book
00:26:40,00:26:44,"and they had it hidden behind the desk,"
00:26:44,00:26:46,as it wasn't on display.
00:26:46,00:26:48,Can you guess what the book is?
00:26:48,00:26:51,So they had every banned book from around the world.
00:26:51,00:26:52,"And I said, ""Oh, do you have this one?"""
00:26:52,00:26:54,"And they went, ""We do, but it's behind the desk."
00:26:54,00:26:56,"We're not allowed to put it on display."""
00:26:56,00:26:57,"Oh, we're not putting it on display."
00:26:57,00:26:58,- Is it a famous book?
00:26:58,00:26:59,Will you definitely have heard of it?
00:26:59,00:27:00,"- It's famous, but whether you've heard of it,"
00:27:00,00:27:02,I don't know. - How?
00:27:02,00:27:04,"- I mean, it's very on topic from what we're talking about."
00:27:04,00:27:07,"- Oh, okay, so a time-related thing maybe."
00:27:07,00:27:09,- Or an anarchist's book.
00:27:09,00:27:10,- The anarchist's cookbook.
00:27:10,00:27:11,- Correct. - Oh!
00:27:11,00:27:16,"- The anarchist's cookbook is in the Museum of Banned Books,"
00:27:16,00:27:18,but isn't on display. - Why not?
00:27:18,00:27:19,- Because it's so dangerous.
00:27:19,00:27:21,- What is it? - What is it?
00:27:21,00:27:24,"- It's a way of making bombs, basically."
00:27:24,00:27:25,- Okay.
00:27:25,00:27:28,"- Also making illicit drugs,"
00:27:28,00:27:31,ways of freaking telecommunication devices.
00:27:31,00:27:34,"So this was written by a guy called Powell,"
00:27:34,00:27:36,"whose first name I can't remember,"
00:27:36,00:27:40,"but anyway, he reneged on it when he got older."
00:27:40,00:27:43,"It was published in 1971, and by 1976,"
00:27:43,00:27:44,he'd converted to Anglicanism
00:27:44,00:27:47,and tried to get his book taken from circulation.
00:27:48,00:27:50,"And in 2011, he and his wife,"
00:27:50,00:27:51,"Och and Kasuma Powell,"
00:27:51,00:27:54,"founded a thing called Next Frontier Inclusion,"
00:27:54,00:27:57,which was a non-profit organization for children
00:27:57,00:27:58,with learning disabilities.
00:27:58,00:28:01,But he did that in a way to atone for this book
00:28:01,00:28:03,"that he'd written, which he can't control"
00:28:03,00:28:05,because he doesn't own the copyright to it anymore.
00:28:05,00:28:07,"It's out there, and that's it."
00:28:07,00:28:09,- Did he do an anarchist thing with the copyright
00:28:09,00:28:10,"or something, or did it just,"
00:28:10,00:28:11,it just got out of there and it's been replicated?
00:28:11,00:28:13,"- No, it was the amount of time"
00:28:13,00:28:16,it just sort of went to the publisher.
00:28:16,00:28:19,"- Silly boy, think before you publish."
00:28:19,00:28:20,- I really thought you were going to say
00:28:20,00:28:22,"the book that you couldn't access, James,"
00:28:22,00:28:23,was Tintin and the Soviets.
00:28:23,00:28:24,"- Oh, that is true."
00:28:24,00:28:27,"Like, I went to the Tintin shop in London"
00:28:27,00:28:29,"and they wouldn't, they would sell it to me,"
00:28:29,00:28:30,"but again, it was not on display."
00:28:30,00:28:33,- You have a knack of finding things behind the counter.
00:28:33,00:28:34,(laughing)
00:28:34,00:28:35,It's interesting.
00:28:35,00:28:39,You can work out what will most freak out any shopkeeper.
00:28:39,00:28:41,"- But that they will own, you know."
00:28:41,00:28:42,"- But they will own, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:28:42,00:28:44,"- I was just looking at money,"
00:28:44,00:28:46,the times when money's been abolished.
00:28:46,00:28:47,Do you know the only country to abolish money?
00:28:47,00:28:50,"- Oh, I'm going to say Bhutan."
00:28:50,00:28:52,"- Oh, I have some boots of these kinds."
00:28:52,00:28:56,"- Okay, I'd like to change my choice to,"
00:28:56,00:28:57,let's say a communist one.
00:28:57,00:28:58,- Yeah.
00:28:58,00:28:59,- Cuba.
00:28:59,00:29:01,"- Oh, no, Angola."
00:29:01,00:29:02,"- You've got the right,"
00:29:02,00:29:03,and he's got the right first letter.
00:29:03,00:29:05,It's definitely less utopian than Bhutan.
00:29:05,00:29:07,- Columbia.
00:29:07,00:29:08,"- Well, it's, I'm just going to tell you."
00:29:08,00:29:10,Same number of syllables.
00:29:10,00:29:11,- Begins with C.
00:29:11,00:29:12,- Yep. - Begins with C.
00:29:12,00:29:13,- All syllables. - Columbia.
00:29:13,00:29:15,"- Oh, no, it's, yeah, same number of syllables."
00:29:15,00:29:16,Four syllables. - Four syllables.
00:29:16,00:29:17,- Cambodia.
00:29:17,00:29:19,- Very good.
00:29:19,00:29:20,"- Under the Khmerz, was it?"
00:29:20,00:29:23,"- Cambodia, under the Khmerz, Pol Pot,"
00:29:23,00:29:27,"who decided to ban money in 1975 when he came into power,"
00:29:27,00:29:30,"and within three weeks, there was a new currency,"
00:29:30,00:29:33,"but then he decided that he didn't want a new currency,"
00:29:33,00:29:35,so he blew up the central bank.
00:29:35,00:29:38,"I mean, obviously he did some absolutely appalling things"
00:29:38,00:29:41,"alongside this, but yeah, blew up the central bank,"
00:29:41,00:29:44,"and money flooded through the streets,"
00:29:44,00:29:45,and people were using it because Cambodia
00:29:45,00:29:48,was in a terrible state by that point because of them.
00:29:48,00:29:50,We were burning money for fire and warrants.
00:29:50,00:29:52,"- How interesting, wow. - Because it didn't exist."
00:29:52,00:29:53,"- When I was in Cambodia,"
00:29:53,00:29:55,"which I admittedly was quite a while ago,"
00:29:55,00:29:57,you would really just buy stuff in dollars.
00:29:57,00:29:59,"- Yeah, same, yeah."
00:29:59,00:30:03,Do you know the commonest denomination of US dollars?
00:30:03,00:30:05,"- One dollar, it must be one dollar."
00:30:05,00:30:07,"- Used to be, in 2016, it was replaced."
00:30:07,00:30:08,It's now the second most common.
00:30:08,00:30:11,"- I'm going to go all the way, the thousand dollar."
00:30:11,00:30:14,"- I'm going to go in the middle, the seven dollar."
00:30:14,00:30:15,(laughing)
00:30:15,00:30:18,- And you've gone too far into the realms of unreality.
00:30:18,00:30:19,"- It's a hundred, it's going to be a hundred."
00:30:19,00:30:22,"- It's a hundred, it's the hundred dollar banknote."
00:30:22,00:30:23,Isn't that insane?
00:30:23,00:30:25,A hundred dollar bills make up almost 80%
00:30:25,00:30:27,"of the value of dollars worldwide,"
00:30:27,00:30:30,"and they are now the most commonly circulated bill,"
00:30:30,00:30:32,and it's almost all held outside of the US.
00:30:32,00:30:34,"- It's a lot of crime though, isn't it?"
00:30:34,00:30:35,"- It's a lot of crime. - It's a lot of art,"
00:30:35,00:30:36,"fraudsters, and drug money,"
00:30:36,00:30:39,because it's large amounts of value in a relatively small--
00:30:39,00:30:41,- Still counts. - It's finicky to do that
00:30:41,00:30:42,"with all one dollar bills, if you're paying for it."
00:30:42,00:30:43,- Yeah.
00:30:43,00:30:46,"- Like 800 kilos of cocaine, and you're at the counter,"
00:30:46,00:30:47,and the guy in front of you is paying him once.
00:30:47,00:30:48,It's annoying.
00:30:48,00:30:50,(laughing)
00:30:50,00:30:52,"- James, just sitting there happily."
00:30:52,00:30:53,"- You take your time, buddy."
00:30:53,00:30:55,"- It's all right, I'm going to be buying this stuff"
00:30:55,00:30:56,he has behind the counter.
00:30:56,00:30:58,(laughing)
00:30:58,00:31:01,(upbeat music)
00:31:01,00:31:07,"- Okay, it is time for fact number three, and that is James."
00:31:07,00:31:10,"- Okay, my fact this week is that the 2023 Nobel Prize"
00:31:10,00:31:13,for Chemistry was won for discovering something
00:31:13,00:31:16,that has been used in stained glass window making
00:31:16,00:31:18,for a thousand years.
00:31:18,00:31:20,"Glass, it was."
00:31:20,00:31:22,- Whoa. - Discovered that.
00:31:22,00:31:23,- It was a really late award.
00:31:23,00:31:25,- We didn't know where it came from before.
00:31:25,00:31:26,- No one knew what glass was.
00:31:26,00:31:27,"- Amazing. - And then they were like,"
00:31:27,00:31:28,"""Oh, it's in all those windows as well."""
00:31:28,00:31:29,"No, it wasn't that."
00:31:29,00:31:31,It was Quantum Dots.
00:31:31,00:31:38,"It was won by Maungi G. Bowendi, Louis E. Bruce,"
00:31:38,00:31:42,"and Alexei Ekimov, and they discovered Quantum Dots,"
00:31:42,00:31:45,"which are tiny, tiny particles."
00:31:45,00:31:49,"You fire light into them, and depending on their size,"
00:31:49,00:31:51,they re-emit light of a different color.
00:31:51,00:31:54,It's all due to this thing we call science.
00:31:54,00:31:55,(laughing)
00:31:55,00:31:58,"Talking about that, and Quantum Science at that."
00:31:58,00:32:01,"We don't need to really go into all that stuff today,"
00:32:01,00:32:03,but scientists have looked at glass back
00:32:03,00:32:05,"from the 10th century and found tiny bits of gold,"
00:32:05,00:32:08,"tiny bits of silver, and they act in the same way"
00:32:08,00:32:09,that Quantum Dots act.
00:32:09,00:32:12,"When the sunlight comes in, they enhance the red light"
00:32:12,00:32:13,and enhance the yellow light.
00:32:13,00:32:18,"- And it's the size of the Quantum Dot,"
00:32:18,00:32:21,"which are only, there are a few nanometers across,"
00:32:21,00:32:24,and the bigger ones emit a different color
00:32:24,00:32:26,when light is fired at them than the smaller ones.
00:32:26,00:32:28,It's basically--
00:32:28,00:32:31,"- It took quite a long time for me to understand it,"
00:32:31,00:32:33,but there's a really good explanation in the article
00:32:33,00:32:36,"that was sent by the American Chemical Society's president,"
00:32:36,00:32:38,"Judith Goyardun, G-I-O-R-T."
00:32:38,00:32:41,"- Ironically, pronouncing her name is more difficult"
00:32:41,00:32:42,than the Quantum Mechanics.
00:32:42,00:32:45,"- Judith Jordan, and she says to think of it"
00:32:45,00:32:48,"like a little box, so basically the particle is the box,"
00:32:48,00:32:51,and you have the electrons bashing off the sides
00:32:51,00:32:53,"of the walls of the box on the inside,"
00:32:53,00:32:55,"but when you've got a big box, it's gonna take longer"
00:32:55,00:32:57,for the electrons to bash into the size.
00:32:57,00:32:59,"When the particle is shrunk down,"
00:32:59,00:33:01,"the electrons are bashing quicker and quicker,"
00:33:01,00:33:03,"and that's where it's emitting the different color, basically."
00:33:03,00:33:06,So it's to do with the size of the box
00:33:06,00:33:08,and the electrons smashing into the sides.
00:33:08,00:33:10,"- It is hard, it's hard to understand."
00:33:10,00:33:11,"- The thing is, they glow."
00:33:11,00:33:13,"They're very exciting 'cause they glow,"
00:33:13,00:33:14,"and they're very colorful,"
00:33:14,00:33:15,and the reason they've won the Nobel Prize
00:33:15,00:33:18,is 'cause they basically made television a bit better.
00:33:18,00:33:20,As far as I can tell.
00:33:20,00:33:23,"- We're gonna have cool quantum tellies, QLEDs."
00:33:23,00:33:28,"- QLEDs, and it's the same principle as a normal LED TV,"
00:33:28,00:33:31,which is that light is shone from behind onto the dots.
00:33:31,00:33:33,"They glow in different colors,"
00:33:33,00:33:34,and you're watching your show
00:33:34,00:33:36,and you don't really need to think about it.
00:33:36,00:33:38,- But like if you think about an old computer screen
00:33:38,00:33:40,"or something, you could only really get like blue"
00:33:40,00:33:43,"and yellow and magenta, like a printer."
00:33:43,00:33:46,"You only get those colors, and to make any other color,"
00:33:46,00:33:48,"you have to mix them up in different amounts,"
00:33:48,00:33:50,"and you will be able to get a certain number of colors,"
00:33:50,00:33:53,"but these QLEDs can show you way more colors,"
00:33:53,00:33:56,more colors than you could possibly imagine.
00:33:56,00:33:56,- Yes. - Yes.
00:33:56,00:33:58,- Like teal.
00:33:58,00:33:59,- Wow. - Incredible.
00:33:59,00:34:01,- I can't imagine that. - Now with teals.
00:34:01,00:34:02,- Incredible. - Yeah.
00:34:02,00:34:03,- And mauve.
00:34:03,00:34:04,- Yeah.
00:34:04,00:34:05,- Puce.
00:34:05,00:34:08,- And we should just say in defense
00:34:08,00:34:09,of the Nobel Prize-winning scientists
00:34:09,00:34:11,that they are used for other things as well.
00:34:11,00:34:14,They're gonna hopefully revolutionize the world of medicine
00:34:14,00:34:16,because you're gonna be able to spot the colors
00:34:16,00:34:17,"on the inside of the body,"
00:34:17,00:34:19,so they're gonna be used for diagnosing certain bits
00:34:19,00:34:20,of the body. - What?
00:34:20,00:34:22,- Yeah. - How do you mean?
00:34:22,00:34:24,"- I don't know if you've explained that the right way,"
00:34:24,00:34:26,it's spot the colors on the inside of the body.
00:34:26,00:34:29,- Do you mean send markers into the body
00:34:29,00:34:30,that can identify- - Exactly.
00:34:30,00:34:32,"- It's like, ""Oh, you've got a green liver."
00:34:32,00:34:35,"You've got an orange pancreas."""
00:34:35,00:34:38,- It's the leave to highlight spots
00:34:38,00:34:40,"where you need to monitor and make sure that things,"
00:34:40,00:34:41,"and that's the opening application of it,"
00:34:41,00:34:44,"just on nanotechnology and medicine,"
00:34:44,00:34:45,and this is another cool use of nanotech.
00:34:45,00:34:47,This is nano shells.
00:34:47,00:34:49,So these are hollow gold or silver spheres
00:34:49,00:34:51,wrapped around silica.
00:34:51,00:34:51,"Okay, so I think they are hollow,"
00:34:51,00:34:53,but they're two layers. - Okay.
00:34:53,00:34:56,"- Like a Ferrero Rocher, but small."
00:34:56,00:34:58,But so small that you could eat lots and it wouldn't matter.
00:34:58,00:35:01,"So if you fire light at these nano shells,"
00:35:01,00:35:02,"they heat up massively,"
00:35:02,00:35:04,"'cause they're made of gold and silver, right?"
00:35:04,00:35:07,"So the idea is, if you have someone who's got cancer,"
00:35:07,00:35:11,"you can inject the tumor with these nano shells,"
00:35:11,00:35:13,then you fire infrared light.
00:35:13,00:35:16,"Now, the light passes through the water in your cells"
00:35:16,00:35:18,because the water in your cells
00:35:18,00:35:19,doesn't absorb much infrared light.
00:35:19,00:35:23,These nano shells absorb huge amounts of infrared light.
00:35:23,00:35:27,"They heat up massively and it kills the tumor off, right?"
00:35:27,00:35:28,"So if you can, yeah,"
00:35:28,00:35:31,"and they're experimenting at the moment on raw chicken,"
00:35:31,00:35:33,but the hope is that it'll make the leap
00:35:33,00:35:36,from raw chicken to people.
00:35:36,00:35:37,It's a really clever idea.
00:35:37,00:35:39,- Are they basically cooking chicken
00:35:39,00:35:41,by putting these nano dots inside it?
00:35:41,00:35:43,"- Effectively, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:35:43,00:35:43,- That's clever.
00:35:43,00:35:45,- Very cool. - That's really good.
00:35:45,00:35:46,- It's a good idea.
00:35:46,00:35:47,- Quicker cooking in better tellies.
00:35:47,00:35:51,"- When Ekimov first came up with the idea of quantum dots,"
00:35:51,00:35:55,he was working at the Vavilyev State Optical Institute
00:35:55,00:35:57,in Soviet Russia.
00:35:57,00:36:00,"And he had got these special glass objects,"
00:36:00,00:36:04,"semiconductor glass objects, known as shot glasses."
00:36:04,00:36:05,- Whee!
00:36:05,00:36:06,- Sorry.
00:36:06,00:36:07,- Isn't that cool?
00:36:07,00:36:08,They were known as shot glasses
00:36:08,00:36:09,and they were lots of different colors
00:36:09,00:36:12,and he developed the theories to explain their color.
00:36:12,00:36:14,And the interesting thing about those shot glasses
00:36:14,00:36:17,is they were made by a company founded by Otto Schott.
00:36:17,00:36:20,"Okay, and that company still exists"
00:36:20,00:36:25,and they made 90% of the first one billion COVID vaccine bottles.
00:36:25,00:36:26,- Wow.
00:36:26,00:36:29,- So 90% of the first billion COVID vaccines
00:36:29,00:36:31,were delivered in shot glasses.
00:36:31,00:36:33,"- Lovely, beautiful. - That's really cool."
00:36:33,00:36:35,"- That's great, so funny."
00:36:35,00:36:36,"- Ekimov, who you mentioned,"
00:36:36,00:36:39,"as you say, he was in Soviet Union in 1981"
00:36:39,00:36:42,"when he became, in fact, the first person, I think,"
00:36:42,00:36:44,to generate these quantum dots and to identify them
00:36:44,00:36:46,and learn how to generate them.
00:36:46,00:36:48,But it's just one of those amazing things.
00:36:48,00:36:50,"It's so weird how often you read about this,"
00:36:50,00:36:51,"I guess, when we do what we do,"
00:36:51,00:36:53,things happening simultaneously.
00:36:53,00:36:56,"It just shows how predictable a path humans are on, I think,"
00:36:56,00:36:58,because is it Bruce?
00:36:58,00:36:59,"Do you pronounce it, do you know?"
00:36:59,00:37:00,- That's how I pronounced it.
00:37:00,00:37:01,- Cool.
00:37:01,00:37:02,- It could be brew.
00:37:02,00:37:03,"- Brew, okay."
00:37:03,00:37:05,- Fancy a brew?
00:37:05,00:37:06,- Fancy a brew in your shot glass.
00:37:06,00:37:08,- Is that Scottish?
00:37:08,00:37:09,"- Scouts, I think."
00:37:09,00:37:11,"- I don't know, I don't know."
00:37:11,00:37:14,(all laughing)
00:37:14,00:37:16,"At exactly the same time in America,"
00:37:16,00:37:19,Louis Bruce was working on the similar thing
00:37:19,00:37:22,"and he came up with it pretty much a year later, I think."
00:37:22,00:37:23,"And the interesting thing was,"
00:37:23,00:37:25,"I hadn't realised at the Soviet Union,"
00:37:25,00:37:26,"if you did science there at the time,"
00:37:26,00:37:27,it basically didn't get anywhere
00:37:27,00:37:30,because you had to publish it in extremely obscure journals
00:37:30,00:37:33,that no Western scientists were really reading
00:37:33,00:37:34,'cause it was all thought it was a bit backwards.
00:37:34,00:37:35,- And in Russian as well.
00:37:35,00:37:38,"- And in Russian, which, you know, a lot of us can't read."
00:37:38,00:37:41,"And so Bruce, a year or two later,"
00:37:41,00:37:43,"read this thing in a journal and good on him,"
00:37:43,00:37:44,"he read it and was like,"
00:37:44,00:37:47,"""Oh, that guy's done the thing I did a bit before me."""
00:37:47,00:37:49,"So got in touch with him, wrote him a letter to say,"
00:37:49,00:37:50,"""Shall we hook up?"""
00:37:50,00:37:52,"- A very, what?"
00:37:52,00:37:52,"That's, wow."
00:37:52,00:37:54,- Then they had a beautiful romance blast.
00:37:54,00:37:55,- Wow.
00:37:55,00:37:57,(all laughing)
00:37:57,00:38:00,"- Amongi Balwadi, who was the third person"
00:38:00,00:38:01,"who won the Nobel Prize,"
00:38:01,00:38:03,failed his first chemistry test at Harvard.
00:38:03,00:38:07,And he was specifically the chemist who came on board
00:38:07,00:38:09,to sort of make what the other two had discovered
00:38:09,00:38:11,become practically applicable.
00:38:11,00:38:13,"And yeah, he did a speech recently saying,"
00:38:13,00:38:14,he failed the chemistry test
00:38:14,00:38:17,and actually got the worst grade in his whole class.
00:38:17,00:38:19,"And said, ""That could have destroyed me,"
00:38:19,00:38:21,"""but I decided that it wouldn't."""
00:38:21,00:38:23,And it was such a...
00:38:23,00:38:25,- I decided that it wouldn't.
00:38:25,00:38:26,- I decided.
00:38:26,00:38:27,And that's the lesson.
00:38:27,00:38:28,"Good luck, guys."
00:38:28,00:38:31,"There was like, there's a book about archery,"
00:38:31,00:38:33,"about the best way to be an archer,"
00:38:33,00:38:34,like a really old one.
00:38:34,00:38:37,"And the first line is, ""First, decide to succeed."""
00:38:37,00:38:39,"- Wow, that's so good."
00:38:39,00:38:41,- That's awesome.
00:38:41,00:38:43,"I really like that these three winners, by the way,"
00:38:43,00:38:45,they all advanced it in a slightly different way.
00:38:45,00:38:47,Each brought something new to it.
00:38:47,00:38:50,"And I do like that the Nobel Prize system works like that,"
00:38:50,00:38:51,that it's not just the person
00:38:51,00:38:53,"who's found the application to the thing,"
00:38:53,00:38:54,it's the person who identified it.
00:38:54,00:38:58,"It's like giving a goal score in football,"
00:38:58,00:39:00,"not only to the person who's kicked or headed the ball in,"
00:39:00,00:39:02,but to the assist.
00:39:02,00:39:04,And then even to someone who passed it to the assist.
00:39:04,00:39:06,- The whole team gets that goal.
00:39:06,00:39:08,"It actually, football does work like that,"
00:39:08,00:39:11,because goals are not given to individual players.
00:39:11,00:39:13,You're schooling me on football.
00:39:13,00:39:15,"- But increasingly, you do find out"
00:39:15,00:39:17,who the assist was for every goal.
00:39:17,00:39:18,- Yeah.
00:39:18,00:39:19,"- And when you do, yeah."
00:39:19,00:39:20,"- Yeah, you always do."
00:39:20,00:39:21,"- And when they talk about, let's say,"
00:39:21,00:39:23,"Mbappe's done whatever he's done this season,"
00:39:23,00:39:26,"they'll say he's got this many goals and this many assists,"
00:39:26,00:39:27,and they will mention it each time.
00:39:27,00:39:28,"- Oh, I see."
00:39:28,00:39:30,"- And I think it kind of began from fancy football,"
00:39:30,00:39:33,"because you get points for how many goals your player scored,"
00:39:33,00:39:34,but they wanted to give points
00:39:34,00:39:35,"to the people who were creating the goals,"
00:39:35,00:39:36,and they get to them as well.
00:39:36,00:39:37,- Really? - Wow.
00:39:37,00:39:40,"- Well, I've forgotten that it wasn't always like that."
00:39:40,00:39:41,"- Definitely not, yeah."
00:39:41,00:39:44,"- The Nobel Prize for Medicine this year,"
00:39:44,00:39:45,"or last year in 2023,"
00:39:45,00:39:49,was given to Kathleen Caracol and Drew Weisman
00:39:49,00:39:53,"for some mRNA vaccine stuff for COVID,"
00:39:53,00:39:57,but they had the initial manuscript rejected by nature
00:39:57,00:39:59,and by science. - Really?
00:39:59,00:40:00,- No way.
00:40:00,00:40:01,- And they were rejected by nature.
00:40:01,00:40:03,"- Do you mean by the journals, ""Nature and Science""?"
00:40:03,00:40:05,- Yes. (laughing)
00:40:05,00:40:07,"- Also, ""God and Man"" were rejected."
00:40:07,00:40:08,(laughing)
00:40:08,00:40:09,Your work.
00:40:10,00:40:15,"- Yeah, so ""Nature"" the journal rejected it within 24 hours."
00:40:15,00:40:15,- Oh.
00:40:15,00:40:18,- And so they didn't even send it to any reviewers or whatever.
00:40:18,00:40:20,They just got the letter through the post
00:40:20,00:40:21,"and went, ""This is shit."""
00:40:21,00:40:22,- Really? - And just threw it away.
00:40:22,00:40:22,- Wow.
00:40:22,00:40:23,- What did you say it was for?
00:40:23,00:40:24,It was for mRNA?
00:40:24,00:40:28,- It was for developing more effective mRNA vaccines
00:40:28,00:40:30,against COVID-19.
00:40:30,00:40:32,"- I just, I really worry about sort of Trump"
00:40:32,00:40:32,"listening to this and going,"
00:40:32,00:40:35,"""See, I told you, nature and science agree with me."""
00:40:35,00:40:37,- But what it was is that they didn't think
00:40:37,00:40:40,that it was a big enough advancement.
00:40:40,00:40:43,They thought they were just kind of repeating old things
00:40:43,00:40:44,"that people had already said,"
00:40:44,00:40:46,but actually later on they realized
00:40:46,00:40:48,"that it was actually a big, big advancement."
00:40:48,00:40:53,"The 2023 Nobel Prize for Physics,"
00:40:53,00:40:55,"which was won by Pierre Agostini,"
00:40:55,00:40:57,"Ferench Kraus and Anne Wheelier,"
00:40:57,00:41:00,is a way of measuring things
00:41:00,00:41:03,with atto-second pulses of light.
00:41:03,00:41:06,An atto-second is even shorter than a nanosecond.
00:41:06,00:41:09,"It's extremely, extremely short amount of time."
00:41:10,00:41:13,"In fact, it's one quintillionth of a second."
00:41:13,00:41:14,And if you wanted to have a quick meeting
00:41:14,00:41:16,"with every insect on earth,"
00:41:16,00:41:20,"but had to complete all the meetings in one second,"
00:41:20,00:41:23,then each insect would get an atto-second of your time.
00:41:23,00:41:23,- Oh.
00:41:23,00:41:26,Food for thought.
00:41:26,00:41:28,"- And they managed to make these pulses of light,"
00:41:28,00:41:31,each one an atto-second in length.
00:41:31,00:41:34,And that means that if you think about a movie
00:41:34,00:41:37,"has however many frames per second,"
00:41:37,00:41:39,"if you can make one every atto-second,"
00:41:39,00:41:41,then suddenly you can see things
00:41:41,00:41:43,that are happening almost instantaneously.
00:41:43,00:41:45,"- I just find that when I'm watching films,"
00:41:45,00:41:46,"and I don't mean to denigrate these people,"
00:41:46,00:41:48,but I find the colors fine
00:41:48,00:41:50,and the speed at which I see things happening is fine.
00:41:50,00:41:52,- You're still confused about the plot 10 minutes in.
00:41:52,00:41:54,It doesn't matter.
00:41:54,00:41:55,- I'm sorry.
00:41:55,00:41:57,I should say that these atto-second stuff
00:41:57,00:41:58,will not be used to--
00:41:58,00:42:01,"- To fill the next born identity, right, okay."
00:42:01,00:42:04,- It means that you can see like photosynthesis
00:42:04,00:42:06,happening in real time.
00:42:06,00:42:07,"- Hang on, are you saying it also won't be used"
00:42:07,00:42:09,to give lots of insects performance reviews?
00:42:09,00:42:10,(laughing)
00:42:10,00:42:11,- None of that.
00:42:11,00:42:12,- What is the point then?
00:42:12,00:42:14,I don't need to see photosynthesis happening in real time.
00:42:14,00:42:15,I'm sure it's really useful.
00:42:15,00:42:18,"- Well, Anne-Louis Lié said that basic research"
00:42:18,00:42:19,is very important because you never know
00:42:19,00:42:22,what applications will be found in 50 years' time.
00:42:22,00:42:23,"We don't know what they'll be,"
00:42:23,00:42:26,"but something, this kind of technology"
00:42:26,00:42:28,"will change our lives, but we don't know how yet."
00:42:28,00:42:30,- We'll be kicking ourselves when the ninth born film
00:42:30,00:42:31,"is filmed using this method,"
00:42:31,00:42:34,"and you can see him punch the guy as it happens,"
00:42:34,00:42:37,rather than slightly after it happens.
00:42:37,00:42:41,- But can we address the heated debate on nano?
00:42:41,00:42:42,"- Oh yeah, I'm sure. - Oh, great."
00:42:42,00:42:44,"- Yeah, so this is nano technology."
00:42:44,00:42:47,This was also written in the birth of nano technology.
00:42:47,00:42:49,How do you spell it?
00:42:49,00:42:51,"- N-A-N-O, no, no."
00:42:51,00:42:55,"- Sometimes yes, and sometimes no."
00:42:55,00:42:57,"- Oh my God, I got really into this etymology."
00:42:57,00:42:59,"- Sometimes no, and sometimes nah."
00:42:59,00:43:01,(laughing)
00:43:01,00:43:04,"- So it first appeared in biology as nano with a double N,"
00:43:04,00:43:06,"1909, this is niche stuff."
00:43:06,00:43:08,- I've never seen it spelled with double N.
00:43:08,00:43:10,- N-A-N-N-O. - Yes.
00:43:10,00:43:12,"- Or N-N-A-N-O, no, no."
00:43:12,00:43:13,(laughing)
00:43:13,00:43:14,- I think you know the answer to that question.
00:43:14,00:43:16,- All right.
00:43:16,00:43:17,- So the reason you haven't seen it
00:43:17,00:43:18,"is 'cause it was used in zoology,"
00:43:18,00:43:22,"and it was in biology, it is used with a double N."
00:43:22,00:43:24,"It's much rarer in biology, and it just meant very small,"
00:43:24,00:43:28,and it's 'cause nano in Greek meant dwarf.
00:43:28,00:43:30,"So nano bacteria, nano plankton,"
00:43:30,00:43:33,that it just became a tiny thing to mean tiny.
00:43:33,00:43:36,"Then physics took it on, but there's a rule in physics,"
00:43:36,00:43:38,"which I didn't know about, which is very niche,"
00:43:38,00:43:41,"but very exciting, which is that"
00:43:41,00:43:44,"if something is a multiple of something,"
00:43:44,00:43:46,"so let's say you've got a meter,"
00:43:46,00:43:48,"if you're saying a thousand meters, what's that?"
00:43:48,00:43:50,- Kilometer. - A kilometer.
00:43:50,00:43:53,"And that, you use the Greek, so kilometer,"
00:43:53,00:43:54,kilo is from Greek. - Okay.
00:43:54,00:43:57,"- If it's a submultiple, a factor,"
00:43:57,00:43:59,"like a thousandth of a meter, what do we say?"
00:43:59,00:44:00,- Millie.
00:44:00,00:44:02,"- Because if it's a submultiple,"
00:44:02,00:44:04,exactly we use the Latin. - What?
00:44:04,00:44:07,- So they shouldn't have used the double N in nano
00:44:07,00:44:10,because that was the Greek. - Oh my God.
00:44:10,00:44:14,"- Whereas the Latin for dwarf uses a single N, nanos,"
00:44:14,00:44:19,and so the physicists who were adhering to convention
00:44:19,00:44:21,changed it to a single N.
00:44:21,00:44:24,Aren't you delighted? - There is no other podcast
00:44:24,00:44:25,is blowing shit wide open like this.
00:44:25,00:44:27,"- Anna, I'm so sorry, I actually heard that fact"
00:44:27,00:44:29,on Shagged Married Anoid last week.
00:44:29,00:44:32,(all laughing)
00:44:32,00:44:34,But it was Shagged Married Anoid
00:44:34,00:44:36,"with only one N, because..."
00:44:36,00:44:39,- That'll be my spin-off.
00:44:39,00:44:41,"- Shagged Married Anoid, the batteries podcast."
00:44:41,00:44:43,"- Yeah. - Beautiful, that's your spin-off."
00:44:43,00:44:45,"- There we go. - Shagged Married Anoid,"
00:44:45,00:44:47,which is mine about my sinus problems.
00:44:47,00:44:49,(all laughing)
00:44:49,00:44:52,"- Shagged Married Anoid, for Dan."
00:44:52,00:44:54,"- Oh no, that's mean."
00:44:54,00:44:57,"- You're lucky, I don't know what that word means."
00:44:57,00:44:59,It's another word for wife guy.
00:44:59,00:45:01,"- That's it, okay."
00:45:01,00:45:04,"- Shagged Married, really happy, love my wife."
00:45:04,00:45:07,(all laughing)
00:45:07,00:45:08,"- Make love, marriage."
00:45:08,00:45:12,(all laughing)
00:45:12,00:45:14,"- Marry, then make love."
00:45:14,00:45:16,(all laughing)
00:45:16,00:45:19,(upbeat music)
00:45:19,00:45:25,"- Okay, it is time for a final fact of the show,"
00:45:25,00:45:26,and that is my fact.
00:45:26,00:45:28,My fact this week is that right
00:45:28,00:45:30,"at the southernmost point of Sweden,"
00:45:30,00:45:34,you will find a statue of Umar Thurman's naked granny.
00:45:34,00:45:38,"- I'm gonna say, as a guess,"
00:45:38,00:45:41,that it will not be her when she was a granny.
00:45:41,00:45:44,It might have been her in earlier life.
00:45:44,00:45:48,"- Yeah, you would say that in the correct way, yes."
00:45:48,00:45:48,(all laughing)
00:45:48,00:45:49,- I'm like that.
00:45:49,00:45:52,(all laughing)
00:45:52,00:45:53,"- Yeah, she was a model."
00:45:53,00:45:56,"Her grandmother was a model called Birgit Holmquist,"
00:45:56,00:45:59,"and the sculptor, who wanted to make the statue,"
00:45:59,00:46:00,"hired her as a model,"
00:46:00,00:46:04,and it's positioned right on this little seaside port
00:46:04,00:46:08,"in this town, which is called Smigahuk, outside of--"
00:46:08,00:46:09,- Trellarborgs.
00:46:09,00:46:10,- Outside of Trellarborgs.
00:46:10,00:46:11,- Yeah.
00:46:11,00:46:12,"- Is it more, is basically,"
00:46:12,00:46:15,"if you go past the new granny statue,"
00:46:15,00:46:16,you are leaving Sweden.
00:46:16,00:46:17,"- No, I don't, I'm not sure it's--"
00:46:17,00:46:18,- It's a nice statue.
00:46:18,00:46:20,"- It's a beautiful statue, you know."
00:46:20,00:46:21,- Is it full naked?
00:46:21,00:46:22,"- She has, yeah."
00:46:22,00:46:23,- No fig leaf or anything?
00:46:23,00:46:24,- Nope.
00:46:24,00:46:25,- Good on it.
00:46:25,00:46:26,"- No, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:46:26,00:46:27,"- Okay, wow."
00:46:27,00:46:29,Do we know anything else about this woman?
00:46:29,00:46:31,"Did the statues all over the world of her,"
00:46:31,00:46:33,or was she just that and then gone?
00:46:33,00:46:36,"- No, I mean, you know, she was a model,"
00:46:36,00:46:38,"but really the Thurman family,"
00:46:38,00:46:39,like they're all such fascinating people.
00:46:39,00:46:41,- I reckon it started with these guys.
00:46:41,00:46:42,- Yeah.
00:46:42,00:46:44,"- So she was a great Swedish beauty,"
00:46:44,00:46:47,but not from like an extremely rich family
00:46:47,00:46:48,or anything like that.
00:46:48,00:46:51,But she married a Westphalian baron
00:46:51,00:46:54,called Karl von Schläbrugge.
00:46:54,00:46:55,- Lovely.
00:46:55,00:46:58,- And Karl von Schläbrugge had a monocle.
00:46:58,00:46:58,He was a baron.
00:46:58,00:46:59,- Of course he did.
00:46:59,00:47:02,- He was briefly jailed by the Nazis
00:47:02,00:47:04,for refusing to denounce his business partners
00:47:04,00:47:09,who were Jewish and Bridget used her Swedish nationality
00:47:09,00:47:11,"to kind of say, oh, look, he's Swedish as well."
00:47:11,00:47:12,He needs to come out.
00:47:12,00:47:12,He needs to come out.
00:47:12,00:47:14,And they managed to get him out of prison.
00:47:14,00:47:16,"And then they moved off to,"
00:47:16,00:47:18,I think they went to Mexico or China
00:47:18,00:47:19,or something like that away from the war.
00:47:19,00:47:20,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:47:20,00:47:23,"- And yeah, that was basically the start of the dynasty."
00:47:23,00:47:25,- Basically they fled Nazi Germany
00:47:25,00:47:28,at what is now clearly the most socially acceptable time
00:47:28,00:47:30,and we've done that which is in the 1930s
00:47:30,00:47:33,rather than in 1945 halfway through.
00:47:33,00:47:35,"I moved to Central South America at the, yeah, yeah."
00:47:35,00:47:37,"- You've got to specify, don't you?"
00:47:37,00:47:39,"Oh, I moved to South America from Nazi Germany."
00:47:39,00:47:39,When?
00:47:39,00:47:41,(laughing)
00:47:41,00:47:43,- Because actually there was another German
00:47:43,00:47:45,living in Mexico at the same time
00:47:45,00:47:48,"with a very, very similar name who was a Nazi spy."
00:47:48,00:47:51,And some people on the internet think it's the same person.
00:47:51,00:47:53,I'm pretty sure it isn't the same person.
00:47:53,00:47:54,- Von Schläbrugge's.
00:47:54,00:47:56,"- I'm also pretty sure that Mexico isn't South America,"
00:47:56,00:47:58,"by the way, in case someone complains about it."
00:47:58,00:47:59,- Is Central America?
00:47:59,00:48:01,"- No, it's North America."
00:48:01,00:48:01,- What?
00:48:01,00:48:04,(laughing)
00:48:04,00:48:05,Then what's Canada?
00:48:05,00:48:07,(laughing)
00:48:07,00:48:09,"Sorry, great point, great point, great point, great point."
00:48:09,00:48:11,"Sorry, sorry to all that."
00:48:11,00:48:12,Do we have listeners in Mexico?
00:48:12,00:48:13,"I don't know, I don't think I've ever had an email"
00:48:13,00:48:14,from anyone in Mexico.
00:48:14,00:48:15,"- Okay, if you're in Mexico."
00:48:15,00:48:16,"- Yeah, right in, absolutely."
00:48:16,00:48:17,"- Right in, please."
00:48:17,00:48:19,"- So, okay, that's the Schläbrugge's."
00:48:19,00:48:22,"And then Uma Thurman's mum, so their daughter,"
00:48:22,00:48:24,was Nina Von Schläbrugge.
00:48:24,00:48:26,And she was also a model
00:48:26,00:48:27,'cause she was very good looking.
00:48:27,00:48:28,'Cause she had monocle jeans.
00:48:28,00:48:30,- Monocle jeans.
00:48:30,00:48:34,And she was a model in Manhattan.
00:48:34,00:48:37,"And she modeled for Dali, Salvador Dali, I think."
00:48:37,00:48:39,"- Yeah, she was very old. - Yeah, she was wild, wasn't she?"
00:48:39,00:48:41,"She, as in the life that she led"
00:48:41,00:48:43,"and the names that come up,"
00:48:43,00:48:45,so before she married her husband
00:48:45,00:48:48,"that would lead to Uma and her brothers,"
00:48:48,00:48:50,"she was married very briefly to Timothy Leary,"
00:48:50,00:48:53,who she was introduced to by Salvador Dali.
00:48:53,00:48:55,"So Timothy Leary, for those who don't know him,"
00:48:55,00:48:58,he led the big push for psychedelics and LSD
00:48:58,00:49:01,and counterculture in America in the '60s.
00:49:01,00:49:03,- Briefly was correct.
00:49:03,00:49:03,- Yeah.
00:49:03,00:49:04,- They were married very briefly.
00:49:04,00:49:06,They separated during the honeymoon.
00:49:06,00:49:07,- No.
00:49:07,00:49:11,"- Leary said, we had time travel"
00:49:11,00:49:13,"through a few mythic incarnations,"
00:49:13,00:49:16,played out magical dramas in panoramic realms.
00:49:16,00:49:18,Now we would have to rise
00:49:18,00:49:22,"to that most complex human art, gentle separation."
00:49:22,00:49:23,- Right.
00:49:23,00:49:24,"- Yeah, I'd leave him too, actually."
00:49:24,00:49:26,- So he's describing.
00:49:26,00:49:29,"And she met her then next husband, Uma's dad,"
00:49:29,00:49:31,while she was at a house trying to get Leary
00:49:31,00:49:33,to sign the divorce papers.
00:49:33,00:49:34,"So he was there for other reasons,"
00:49:34,00:49:36,trying to get Leary to do something.
00:49:36,00:49:38,"- Well, I read that Robert Thurman,"
00:49:38,00:49:40,"who was Uma Thurman's dad, obviously,"
00:49:40,00:49:42,was only present at that house
00:49:42,00:49:44,where Nina was trying to persuade him to sign the papers.
00:49:44,00:49:45,He was there trying to stop Leary
00:49:45,00:49:47,taking so many drugs.
00:49:47,00:49:49,- How did that go?
00:49:49,00:49:50,- I don't know.
00:49:50,00:49:51,Not very well.
00:49:51,00:49:51,- That's funny.
00:49:51,00:49:53,"- Leary's the guy who coined the phrase,"
00:49:53,00:49:54,"""Soon in, turn on, drop out."""
00:49:54,00:49:55,- That's right.
00:49:55,00:49:57,- So he's a big counter-culture guy.
00:49:57,00:50:00,But then Robert Thurman is even more interesting
00:50:00,00:50:01,than Timothy Leary.
00:50:01,00:50:05,He's kind of an Indiana Jones style scholar of Buddhism.
00:50:05,00:50:07,And he's very cool.
00:50:07,00:50:09,- He seems to be one of the people who made Buddhism cool
00:50:09,00:50:11,"in the 20th century, really."
00:50:11,00:50:15,Kind of one of the leading popularizers of it in the US.
00:50:15,00:50:19,So he seemed to have a revelation in 1961
00:50:19,00:50:21,when he was changing a flat tire.
00:50:21,00:50:26,And he said the tire iron flicked up into his eye.
00:50:26,00:50:29,And he went into a coma for three days.
00:50:29,00:50:31,So I must have flicked up quite hard.
00:50:31,00:50:33,He woke up and he'd lost an eye.
00:50:33,00:50:35,"But as he says, he lost one eye"
00:50:35,00:50:38,but gained a thousand more as he pushed it.
00:50:38,00:50:39,"- Oh, wow."
00:50:39,00:50:40,- And that's when he gave up.
00:50:40,00:50:41,"- That's a botched surgery, isn't it?"
00:50:41,00:50:44,(all laugh)
00:50:44,00:50:45,- Yeah.
00:50:45,00:50:48,I think the surgeon was on LSD at the time.
00:50:48,00:50:50,"- Dr. Leary, not you."
00:50:50,00:50:52,(all laugh)
00:50:52,00:50:54,"- I don't know, he was one of a playboy"
00:50:54,00:50:55,"and he gave up his old playboy lifestyle,"
00:50:55,00:50:57,"hitchhiked to India and thought,"
00:50:57,00:50:59,"""I really want to become a Buddhist monk."""
00:50:59,00:51:00,- That's kind of what the Buddha did though.
00:51:00,00:51:03,"The Buddha was a sort of playboy prince, wasn't he?"
00:51:03,00:51:03,"- Yeah, that's right."
00:51:03,00:51:06,- But Thurman supposedly became the first American
00:51:06,00:51:09,to become officially a Buddhist monk.
00:51:09,00:51:11,Like to be recognized as one.
00:51:11,00:51:11,- Yeah.
00:51:11,00:51:13,- Do you know how long he lasted?
00:51:13,00:51:13,- How long?
00:51:13,00:51:15,- I think less than a year.
00:51:15,00:51:16,"- Oh, God."
00:51:16,00:51:17,- He met this lama.
00:51:17,00:51:20,"So he flew back from India to America,"
00:51:20,00:51:21,"met this lama and was like,"
00:51:21,00:51:22,"""I've been in India and I'm desperate"
00:51:22,00:51:23,"""to become a Buddhist monk."
00:51:23,00:51:24,"""I'm going to be amazing at it."""
00:51:24,00:51:25,"The lama kept saying,"
00:51:25,00:51:27,"""I'm looking at your karma"
00:51:27,00:51:28,"""and you don't have monk in you."
00:51:28,00:51:30,"""I promise you've got great things destined."""
00:51:30,00:51:31,- You haven't got lama karma?
00:51:31,00:51:35,"- Yeah, I haven't got lama karma, that's what he said."
00:51:35,00:51:37,"But Robert kept on saying,"
00:51:37,00:51:38,"""No, I really want to do it."""
00:51:38,00:51:41,"So eventually the lama took him to meet the Dalai lama,"
00:51:41,00:51:43,"the big lama, as he's otherwise known."
00:51:43,00:51:43,- Boss lama.
00:51:43,00:51:45,"- Boss lama, yeah, boss level,"
00:51:45,00:51:47,who did ordain him as a monk
00:51:47,00:51:49,"and literally within 18 months, he resigned."
00:51:49,00:51:50,"- Why, why?"
00:51:50,00:51:53,- The monk lifestyle he decided wasn't for him.
00:51:53,00:51:55,"- Yeah, he's still leading."
00:51:55,00:51:55,He's still massive.
00:51:55,00:51:56,- He's still leading the movement.
00:51:56,00:51:57,"The Dalai Lama was very like,"
00:51:57,00:51:59,"""Yeah, cool, good move, mate."""
00:51:59,00:52:00,"- The best mate, yes."
00:52:00,00:52:02,He and the Dalai Lama are very close
00:52:02,00:52:04,"and he's the president of Tibet House US,"
00:52:04,00:52:06,which is the main Tibetan organization in the USA.
00:52:06,00:52:08,So they've a bet with each other
00:52:08,00:52:12,to see if they can both live until the year 2048.
00:52:12,00:52:14,- Or it's getting closer.
00:52:14,00:52:16,Do you know how old that would make them both?
00:52:16,00:52:17,'Cause I think he's in--
00:52:17,00:52:19,- Robert Thurman is in his 80s.
00:52:19,00:52:22,"- One of them will be 107, I think, maybe Thurman."
00:52:22,00:52:23,- That was interesting.
00:52:23,00:52:24,- Is it what happened?
00:52:24,00:52:27,"They said, ""Are you gonna live until this date?"""
00:52:27,00:52:28,"And he said, ""Yeah."""
00:52:28,00:52:29,"And he said, ""Want Tibet?"""
00:52:29,00:52:30,"And he said, ""Yes, I do."""
00:52:30,00:52:32,"And then Xi Jinping said, ""Well done."""
00:52:32,00:52:35,- That is too good.
00:52:35,00:52:37,- Uma Thurman sounds like the least interesting
00:52:37,00:52:38,member of her own family.
00:52:38,00:52:39,"I'd presume she was a relatively interesting person,"
00:52:39,00:52:41,but all these antecedents are so interesting.
00:52:41,00:52:43,"- Yeah, they're awesome."
00:52:43,00:52:44,"So James, just on the topic of Uma Thurman,"
00:52:44,00:52:49,"you have been watching her entire output of movies, right?"
00:52:49,00:52:52,"- I've started, yeah."
00:52:52,00:52:53,"But I only started two days ago,"
00:52:53,00:52:55,"so I've watched ""Kill Bill One"" and ""Kill Bill Two."""
00:52:55,00:52:56,- Right.
00:52:56,00:52:58,"- Has any of you seen ""Even Cowgirls Get the Blues?"""
00:52:58,00:52:59,- No.
00:52:59,00:53:00,"- Oh, I think that's, I mean,"
00:53:00,00:53:02,it's based on an amazing book.
00:53:02,00:53:03,- Have you read it?
00:53:03,00:53:05,"- No, no, I have it at home."
00:53:05,00:53:06,"- It's the kind of book you would have read, actually."
00:53:06,00:53:07,"- Yeah, ""Tom Robbins."""
00:53:07,00:53:08,"- Yeah, very good, very good."
00:53:08,00:53:10,"No, it's probably in a very bad film."
00:53:10,00:53:12,But I just love the concept.
00:53:12,00:53:14,It's just about a woman with unusually long thumbs.
00:53:14,00:53:18,"And so it's called ""Even Cowgirls Get the Blues."""
00:53:18,00:53:19,"- But it's an Uma Thurman film, sorry."
00:53:19,00:53:20,- It's an Uma Thurman film.
00:53:20,00:53:23,She plays this girl with very long thumbs.
00:53:23,00:53:24,- That's interesting.
00:53:24,00:53:26,"She doesn't have long thumbs in real life, I don't think."
00:53:26,00:53:28,- So I think she might have had to wear prosthetic thumbs.
00:53:28,00:53:29,"No, she doesn't have..."
00:53:29,00:53:30,"- She has big feet, doesn't she?"
00:53:30,00:53:31,- She's got massive feet.
00:53:31,00:53:33,"- Yeah, that's why she's in all of..."
00:53:33,00:53:34,What's his name?
00:53:34,00:53:35,Who does those films?
00:53:35,00:53:36,- Tarantino.
00:53:36,00:53:37,- Tarantino.
00:53:37,00:53:39,"Yeah, because he likes feet, doesn't he?"
00:53:39,00:53:40,- Does he?
00:53:40,00:53:40,- I think so.
00:53:40,00:53:41,- Because there's lots of shots of her feet
00:53:41,00:53:43,"in these two movies, I can say that."
00:53:43,00:53:45,"She has size 11 feet, and that's American."
00:53:45,00:53:47,- What's that in old money?
00:53:47,00:53:50,"- 12, I don't know, 10."
00:53:50,00:53:51,"- Yeah, it's one either side."
00:53:51,00:53:52,"- Yeah, it's one either side."
00:53:52,00:53:53,"- Well, that's big either way."
00:53:53,00:53:53,- I don't know if it's that.
00:53:53,00:53:54,"- That's very big, I agree."
00:53:54,00:53:55,- Thank you.
00:53:55,00:53:56,- She can't have size 12 feet.
00:53:56,00:53:57,"- No, it's gotta be 10."
00:53:57,00:53:59,- But 10 would be very big.
00:53:59,00:54:00,It's still a good fact.
00:54:00,00:54:02,"- You don't need to write it and tell us, by the way,"
00:54:02,00:54:03,we will have been able to Google the conversions
00:54:03,00:54:04,after this one.
00:54:04,00:54:07,"- Oh no, do not write it, please don't waste your time."
00:54:07,00:54:08,- I don't wanna wake up to 15 emails
00:54:08,00:54:10,about all subject like Uma Thurman feet pics.
00:54:10,00:54:13,"- I don't want that, if you're in Mexico,"
00:54:13,00:54:15,then tell us what size 10 is in your country.
00:54:15,00:54:16,(laughing)
00:54:16,00:54:19,"- And also, which America are you really in?"
00:54:19,00:54:21,(laughing)
00:54:21,00:54:23,"- Oh dear, do you wanna hear about"
00:54:23,00:54:26,another very attractive Swedish woman
00:54:26,00:54:27,who was turned into a statue?
00:54:27,00:54:28,"- Okay, okay."
00:54:28,00:54:29,"- Well, not turned into, the model for."
00:54:29,00:54:30,- Can we guess?
00:54:30,00:54:31,- Absolutely not.
00:54:31,00:54:32,- Brigitte Bardot.
00:54:32,00:54:34,"- No, she's not a famous one."
00:54:34,00:54:35,- Ulrika Johnson.
00:54:35,00:54:37,"- She's still quite famous, I'd say."
00:54:37,00:54:38,- Oh yeah.
00:54:38,00:54:39,"- Do you feel like you're not being listened to, Andy?"
00:54:39,00:54:40,"- No, no, no, no, no, no."
00:54:40,00:54:43,"This is Pitt Karin Err's daughter, okay?"
00:54:43,00:54:43,- Oh.
00:54:43,00:54:47,- She was a Swedish young woman.
00:54:47,00:54:49,She was incredibly beautiful.
00:54:49,00:54:50,"She's just, the whole story about her is just,"
00:54:50,00:54:52,"there was this, she was a milkmaid."
00:54:52,00:54:55,"And the whole story is basically, she was just so fit."
00:54:55,00:54:57,So she went to Stockholm to work for a year.
00:54:57,00:54:59,"And basically, no one could believe"
00:54:59,00:55:01,how attractive this milkmaid was.
00:55:01,00:55:04,"- And the bar is high in Sweden as well, don't you get?"
00:55:04,00:55:07,That's not like being the most attractive person in (beep)
00:55:07,00:55:07,- Wow.
00:55:07,00:55:11,"- So why would you name, leave that place out."
00:55:11,00:55:12,Leave that place name out.
00:55:12,00:55:15,"- That was, bleep it out, no one will ever know"
00:55:15,00:55:17,the place name that I have there.
00:55:17,00:55:18,"Sorry, she was the most attractive person in Stockholm."
00:55:18,00:55:21,"- So she was just so fit, basically."
00:55:21,00:55:23,"- We get it, we get it, she's hot."
00:55:23,00:55:26,- But the stories are like the Crown Prince visitor
00:55:26,00:55:28,"incognito to ask for some milk,"
00:55:28,00:55:30,because he just wanted to look at this milkmaid.
00:55:30,00:55:33,And he forgot to bring a container.
00:55:33,00:55:35,So she gave him a sort of scolding.
00:55:35,00:55:36,- With hot milk?
00:55:36,00:55:37,"- Not a scolding, sorry."
00:55:37,00:55:39,- A scolding.
00:55:39,00:55:43,"- She created traffic jams, cause she was so beautiful."
00:55:43,00:55:46,People was doing a go slow as they went past.
00:55:46,00:55:49,- Or was that just James not moving with his horse and cart?
00:55:49,00:55:50,- Yeah.
00:55:50,00:55:52,And there's a statue of her in Sweden now.
00:55:52,00:55:54,And I think part of the reason she was apparently so beautiful
00:55:54,00:55:57,was that she hadn't had some more pox.
00:55:57,00:55:58,"- Oh, okay."
00:55:58,00:56:00,- So the bar was slightly lower.
00:56:00,00:56:02,"- Yes, she had had cow pox."
00:56:02,00:56:05,And she was accused actually of having sold more
00:56:05,00:56:08,"than just milk, you know what I mean?"
00:56:08,00:56:10,"But that was real trick, trick."
00:56:10,00:56:11,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:56:11,00:56:13,- Milkshake.
00:56:13,00:56:16,"- Actually, she hadn't been selling any,"
00:56:16,00:56:17,she hadn't been-
00:56:17,00:56:18,- Any of her milkshake?
00:56:18,00:56:19,"- Right, yeah, she'd been selling milk"
00:56:19,00:56:20,and she was just accused.
00:56:20,00:56:22,- Her milkshake brought the king to the yard.
00:56:22,00:56:23,- Yeah.
00:56:23,00:56:25,"- And he's like, ""Oh, do you have a spare bowl?"""
00:56:25,00:56:27,(laughing)
00:56:27,00:56:30,- What's the most famous statue in Scandinavia?
00:56:30,00:56:32,- Do you have the answer?
00:56:32,00:56:33,- Yeah.
00:56:33,00:56:35,- The Copenhagen mermaid?
00:56:35,00:56:36,"- The little mermaid, yeah."
00:56:36,00:56:39,Probably an advert for Carlsberg.
00:56:39,00:56:40,"- Oh, no."
00:56:40,00:56:41,- Yeah.
00:56:41,00:56:44,"It was commissioned by the founder of Carlsberg,"
00:56:44,00:56:46,Jacob Christian Carlsberg.
00:56:46,00:56:48,"And he basically said,"
00:56:48,00:56:50,"""Well, you know, I've got the best beer in the country,"
00:56:50,00:56:53,so I'm gonna do this nice little statue
00:56:53,00:56:54,for everyone to see.
00:56:54,00:56:56,"And when they see it, they'll remember me"
00:56:56,00:56:58,"and remember my beer."""
00:56:58,00:57:00,"- Oh dear, that's fucked up, isn't it?"
00:57:00,00:57:03,"Because one of those adverts, which is very memorable,"
00:57:03,00:57:05,that you've got no idea what it was for.
00:57:05,00:57:06,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:57:06,00:57:08,It's probably the best mermaid statue in the world.
00:57:08,00:57:09,- Nice. - Very good.
00:57:09,00:57:12,He hired a sculpture called Edvard Ericsson to create it.
00:57:12,00:57:15,"And he hired a ballerina called Ellen Price,"
00:57:15,00:57:17,"who is very, very famous in Sweden"
00:57:17,00:57:18,at the time to model for it.
00:57:18,00:57:21,But she was unwilling to get naked.
00:57:21,00:57:22,And so the face is hers
00:57:22,00:57:25,and the body is Mr. Ericsson's wife.
00:57:25,00:57:26,- Really?
00:57:26,00:57:28,"- Wow, what about the tail?"
00:57:28,00:57:30,(laughing)
00:57:30,00:57:31,"- No, that's his wife."
00:57:31,00:57:32,- That's his wife.
00:57:32,00:57:35,(laughing)
00:57:35,00:57:37,- I've just got one more celebrity grandparent fact.
00:57:37,00:57:38,- Oh yeah.
00:57:38,00:57:41,- Drew Barrymore's grandfather's corpse was stolen.
00:57:41,00:57:45,"So this is John Barrymore, who was a very famous actor."
00:57:45,00:57:48,"In the, he was the, John's 1922 hamlet,"
00:57:48,00:57:50,which you probably remember was the greatest hamlet
00:57:50,00:57:51,maybe ever.
00:57:51,00:57:52,"- Yeah, that was a good one."
00:57:52,00:57:55,"- It really was, he was a famous actor."
00:57:55,00:57:57,"He was ruined by alcoholism and died in 1942,"
00:57:57,00:57:58,relatively young.
00:57:58,00:58:00,His mates were people like Errol Flynn.
00:58:00,00:58:02,And Errol Flynn wrote in his memoir
00:58:02,00:58:04,"that after Barrymore died,"
00:58:04,00:58:08,"their friend got his body, obtained his body"
00:58:08,00:58:11,and hid it for Errol Flynn to find to freak him out.
00:58:11,00:58:13,So propped him up in a chair
00:58:13,00:58:15,and then they spent the night playing poker with it.
00:58:15,00:58:17,- Is that what we can the Bernys is based on?
00:58:17,00:58:19,"- Do you know what, I think largely it is."
00:58:19,00:58:20,"Cause it was, it was not only Errol Flynn,"
00:58:20,00:58:22,it was David Nevin.
00:58:22,00:58:23,"And I want to say Orson Welles,"
00:58:23,00:58:25,someone in that territory of fame.
00:58:25,00:58:26,- There was a group of them.
00:58:26,00:58:27,- There was a group of them.
00:58:27,00:58:29,- I think it is because I haven't really heard
00:58:29,00:58:32,of any of those people and I've never seen Weekend at Bernys.
00:58:32,00:58:33,"I'm not really sure what happens in it,"
00:58:33,00:58:36,but I still kind of knew that fact.
00:58:36,00:58:38,"- Wait, so it's Weekend at Bernys about them playing."
00:58:38,00:58:39,- I think it's about a dead body.
00:58:39,00:58:40,- Keeping a dead body.
00:58:40,00:58:44,- Their body dies and they need to keep a holiday going.
00:58:44,00:58:47,And so they string him up and they use his dead body.
00:58:47,00:58:48,Yeah.
00:58:48,00:58:49,- There we go.
00:58:49,00:58:50,"That's sort of what they did,"
00:58:50,00:58:52,except just to have a fun gamer poker with him.
00:58:52,00:58:53,- Wow.
00:58:53,00:58:55,- Confirmed by Drew Barrymore in 2020.
00:58:55,00:58:55,- That's right.
00:58:55,00:58:56,- Good Lord.
00:58:56,00:58:57,"- Yeah, that's pretty cool."
00:58:57,00:59:00,"- If I die, please don't do that."
00:59:00,00:59:01,Don't do another podcast.
00:59:01,00:59:04,- What do you want us to do with your dead body then?
00:59:04,00:59:05,"Shall we, we could prop it up and do something fun,"
00:59:05,00:59:07,prop it up and collect some moths with you.
00:59:07,00:59:08,"- Yeah, lovely."
00:59:08,00:59:09,- Or the acid thing.
00:59:09,00:59:10,Let's just burn you.
00:59:10,00:59:12,(laughing)
00:59:12,00:59:17,"- Wow, what a dark term this podcast took at the end."
00:59:17,00:59:20,- It's time to go to our group therapy session now.
00:59:20,00:59:22,And just shoot that over.
