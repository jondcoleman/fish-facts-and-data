1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,920
 - Hi everyone, just before we start this show,

2
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:05,280
 we've got an incredibly exciting announcement to make.

3
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:08,040
 - It is so exciting, especially for people

4
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:12,880
 who like to watch live comedy podcast fact shows.

5
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:14,320
 - What a great description of our show, James.

6
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:16,760
 It's like you've been rehearsing that for years.

7
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:20,520
 Yes, we are going on tour to do our comedy live podcast fact

8
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:24,480
 show. We are going all over the UK and Ireland

9
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:27,080
 and we are then going to Australia.

10
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:29,080
 - And then we are going to New Zealand.

11
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:31,800
 - Indeed we are. When are we doing this?

12
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:34,200
 I hear you ask. Well, we are starting off going to Edinburgh

13
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,520
 to just perform the podcast in August.

14
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:39,920
 - Yes. And then we will go to Bristol, Dublin, Glasgow,

15
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:42,440
 Newcastle, Cardiff, London, Manchester.

16
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:45,440
 We'll play all those places in the UK and Ireland.

17
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:49,800
 And then we are going down under in November.

18
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:52,000
 - Is that your attempt at almost doing an Australian accent?

19
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
 - I pulled out of it at the last second.

20
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,480
 - I think that was a wise choice.

21
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:56,960
 - Well, we're going to go to Adelaide Perth,

22
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:59,200
 Brisbane, Sydney, Melbourne, Auckland, Wellington

23
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:02,720
 and Christchurch. But Anna, how do people get tickets?

24
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:07,280
 - They can go to knowsuchthingsafish.com/fishtour

25
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:10,080
 where you'll find links to any venue that you want to attend.

26
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,680
 Or why not come to all of them?

27
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:14,600
 - Why not? Indeed, I'll be at all of them.

28
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:15,920
 - So will I.

29
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,280
 - So, dude, come along to the show.

30
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,600
 It's going to be so much fun.

31
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:20,760
 We can't wait to get back on tour.

32
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:22,880
 Come to those gigs. Come and say hi.

33
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:24,080
 We'll see you there.

34
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:25,640
 - Okay. On with the show.

35
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:27,640
 - On with the podcast.

36
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:45,600
 - Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish,

37
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:49,480
 a weekly podcast coming to you from the QI offices in Hoburn.

38
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:52,400
 My name is Dan Schreiber. I'm sitting here with James Harkin,

39
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,720
 Anna Tyshinski and Andrew Hunter Murray.

40
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,920
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones

41
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:59,560
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days.

42
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:02,400
 And in a particular order, here we go.

43
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:05,520
 Starting with fact number one, that is Anna.

44
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:08,360
 - My fact this week is that in 1974,

45
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:13,680
 thousands of swallows migrated over the Alps by train and plane.

46
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,200
 - Wow. - But not automobile.

47
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:19,000
 - This is amazing. Yes, it was 1974.

48
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,280
 And there was bad weather all over the Alps.

49
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:24,920
 And this meant that insects were quite hard to find.

50
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,440
 They were dying and not being born.

51
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:29,400
 And the swallows were getting really hungry and cold.

52
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,800
 And this meant that they couldn't fly very well.

53
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:35,800
 And bizarrely, it was the police in Zurich,

54
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:39,200
 who for some reason drew attention to this.

55
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,360
 - This is a crime against nature.

56
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,840
 - Well, exactly. Yeah.

57
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:46,320
 Not too much crime in Zurich at the time, I guess.

58
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:47,640
 And so they said...

59
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:48,880
 (laughing)

60
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:51,760
 - Quickly qualify that because it's a hot place these days.

61
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:52,600
 - Yeah.

62
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:55,640
 And so they said these swallows are having a bad time.

63
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:59,320
 And this thing was organized to fly them over the Alps

64
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:02,160
 or take them by train and Swiss Air flew 10,000 of them.

65
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:03,400
 - Oh, how interesting.

66
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,800
 You see, when you said the fact,

67
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,440
 I thought it was like just a normal swallow

68
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:10,120
 was flying along and then jumped on a train.

69
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:12,440
 You know, like sometimes animals jump on trains.

70
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:13,800
 - Like pigeons. Yeah.

71
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:14,640
 - Oh, don't open this.

72
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,880
 - I know this was, I can't believe you've gone there.

73
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:18,000
 - Or on planes or something,

74
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,320
 but you're saying actual flights were put on.

75
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:21,160
 - Yes, sorry.

76
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:23,080
 - You can see, 'cause swallows, I guess, fly in formation.

77
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:23,960
 So if one goes on a train,

78
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,600
 I guess they'd all follow onto the train.

79
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,440
 And that would just be a terrifying train journey

80
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,840
 for a lot of passengers.

81
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,200
 But no, flights were put on.

82
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,560
 Swiss Air put on lots of flights.

83
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,640
 And then lots more thousands, in fact,

84
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:35,600
 were taken under the Alps or through a tunnel through the Alps.

85
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:38,040
 - Where do they go to swallows?

86
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:40,320
 - They were going to the Mediterranean

87
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,960
 to get a bit warmer.

88
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:44,880
 So they were flown to Nice, Marseille, Barcelona.

89
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:46,000
 They got the train.

90
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
 And yeah.

91
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:47,840
 - It's very nice.

92
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,400
 It's a very heartwarming story.

93
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,440
 It's a lovely tale.

94
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:52,600
 And I learned it from a heartwarming place,

95
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:55,200
 which is a book that my mum got me years ago

96
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,240
 called The Little Book of the Dawn Chorus.

97
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:59,840
 It's made of cardboard, and it's about 10 pages long.

98
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,040
 And each page is a big picture of a bird.

99
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:04,120
 And then you press a button next to that picture,

100
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,880
 and it makes the noise of that bird.

101
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:07,880
 - Isn't it a children's book?

102
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,720
 Doesn't sound like a grown-up's book.

103
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:13,040
 - I think children probably enjoy it for the most part.

104
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,120
 - Are you getting all of your facts these days

105
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,480
 from bedtime reading to your kid?

106
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,800
 You had "Goodnight, Moon."

107
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,680
 - You had "Sweet Packets."

108
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:20,520
 - "Goodnight, Moon."

109
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:21,760
 - Oh, yours was "Goodnight, Moon."

110
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:22,600
 Sorry.

111
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,680
 - God, what was my "Sweet Packets" like?

112
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,960
 - You said you found a fact on the side of a sweetie

113
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:27,800
 that you were--

114
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:28,640
 - Oh, my God.

115
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:30,120
 - Your research has gone downhill a lot.

116
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,520
 - It's a bit ropey, isn't it, actually?

117
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:32,360
 Yeah.

118
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:36,040
 - You do get birds going by ship all around the world.

119
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:36,880
 - Okay.

120
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:39,280
 - And that is more in what I thought the fact was.

121
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,240
 In the flying along, they get a bit tired,

122
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,640
 and they just sit on a ship for a while.

123
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:43,480
 - No.

124
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,560
 - And then they go on the ship for a bit,

125
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,680
 and then they fly off again.

126
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,520
 - That's clever.

127
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:49,120
 - And we found out this because they put tracking signals

128
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:52,000
 on birds, and they went,

129
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,760
 "Well, this one started going really slowly,

130
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:57,040
 "and exactly in the same direction as that tanker

131
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,720
 "that we know goes in this direction."

132
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,640
 - So funny.

133
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:01,880
 - And so, yeah, apparently it is quite common.

134
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:03,880
 If you get injured a little bit,

135
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:06,640
 or if you're flying along and you get to a bit of turbulence

136
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,240
 that you can't really fly through very well,

137
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,960
 you might just drop down, go on a boat for a few days.

138
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:11,800
 - That's so good.

139
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:12,640
 - Nice.

140
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:13,480
 - Fly off again.

141
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:16,040
 - I saw a video the other day of it was either a hawker

142
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:19,040
 or an eagle is giant, and there's a guy who's gliding,

143
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:22,160
 and then it just perches on his frame

144
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,280
 and just kind of like chills out for a second

145
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:26,080
 to get a break and then goes off again.

146
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,040
 It's the most insane footage.

147
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:28,880
 - Do you think the hawk knows

148
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,480
 that it's like a glider or whatever?

149
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,320
 - I don't know.

150
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:33,040
 - Or do you think it thinks it's a really big bird?

151
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:33,880
 - Yeah.

152
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:37,160
 - In which case, do hawks also land on really big birds?

153
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:39,280
 - That was gonna be my next question.

154
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:43,640
 Do they have resting stations on like, yeah, a flock of birds?

155
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:45,120
 - And there's a blue tit on the hawk,

156
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,560
 and then a butterfly on the blue tit.

157
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,880
 - I guess you do that kind of

158
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,760
 when you're flying in formation, right?

159
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,760
 Because you're directly behind someone

160
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:53,480
 and you're kind of hitching the lift

161
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,920
 a little bit on the guy in front.

162
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,040
 - A bit, but if you did climb

163
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,160
 onto the back of the guy in front,

164
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,400
 I think you'd be a noise.

165
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,840
 - There is a theory that would work,

166
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:05,840
 which is if you had flights, let's say from London to Zurich,

167
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:09,000
 there were 10 flights every day, whatever.

168
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,200
 If you were to get them all to go at the same time,

169
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:14,040
 then you could have them flying behind each other,

170
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:17,120
 like geese or like swallows or whatever,

171
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,680
 and that would save us loads and loads of fuel.

172
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,280
 - That's so cool.

173
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,600
 - Oh, we're using the tailwind.

174
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:25,280
 - Yeah, you basically, well, there's no turbulence,

175
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,120
 it's like a slipstream.

176
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,680
 - Yeah, sorry, slipstream is what I mean.

177
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,480
 We're using the literally less air in the way.

178
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:32,280
 - Yeah, and the only reason we don't do that

179
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:34,880
 is because people like Dan are scared of flying.

180
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,320
 - Yeah, I'm not on for it.

181
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:39,320
 If the one in front breaks hard, then I'm going back a bit.

182
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:42,040
 - If you put those air brakes on, that's okay.

183
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,600
 - But what if you just, what if we were,

184
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,680
 we arranged that all the sort of nervous people

185
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,600
 get to go in the front plane, so they're fine.

186
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,560
 - Oh, what if one of them, they're first?

187
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:52,400
 - Oh, yeah, yeah, no, all right.

188
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,840
 - Well, the sleezers go at the back.

189
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,160
 - See, this is why it's not happening.

190
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:57,000
 This is why, because people can't get along.

191
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,840
 - But apparently we have the technology.

192
00:06:58,840 --> 00:06:59,800
 - That's a great idea. - That's a great idea.

193
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:00,640
 - It's a really good idea.

194
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:02,480
 - You don't have to leave at the same time.

195
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:04,240
 - Yeah, that's a problem. - I think convenient,

196
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,800
 sometimes you want to leave at different times.

197
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:06,640
 - I think it's great.

198
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:08,320
 I think I might have mentioned this before.

199
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:10,360
 I would like it if you know when you're in,

200
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:12,440
 if you're sitting in traffic in a car.

201
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:14,360
 Right, technically, as soon as the light goes green,

202
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,560
 it should be fine for everyone

203
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,600
 to just jam on the accelerator to full, right?

204
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,200
 - Yes. - Because as everyone accelerates,

205
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,880
 the gaps also accelerate to the same amount.

206
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:23,280
 - Yeah, yeah, but what about me reading my phone at the front?

207
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,000
 (all laughing)

208
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,680
 - That's what's called a New York second.

209
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,640
 A New York, a New York second is the time

210
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:30,240
 between the lights going green

211
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,640
 and someone directly behind you beeping you,

212
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:34,720
 the second it goes green to get me to move.

213
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:38,360
 - Am I the only person who, when I'm sat second in line

214
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:40,280
 and the other person hasn't noticed,

215
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:42,040
 I don't beep and I'm just like,

216
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,400
 you know what, I'm not gonna beep.

217
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:46,240
 I'm gonna be a good citizen and I'm not gonna honk.

218
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,240
 I'm gonna let them notice by themselves.

219
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,560
 - How long does that last?

220
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,040
 - Just for a friend. - Until it goes red again.

221
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,200
 - Yeah, I don't think-- - I'll just let them do it.

222
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,720
 - I think you might be the only person.

223
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,560
 - Are you doing it if someone's behind you as well?

224
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:56,400
 - Yeah. - Wow.

225
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,240
 - No, I've never-- - Usually the person

226
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,080
 behind me will beep.

227
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,200
 - Exactly, yeah, yeah, yeah.

228
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:01,160
 So what you're doing is you're saving yourself

229
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,600
 the effort of a beep because you know

230
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,680
 that the person behind you will probably

231
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:04,520
 get around to it. - I'm just following

232
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:05,560
 the highway code.

233
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:10,880
 - You're not supposed to be-- - No, you're looking at your phone

234
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:11,720
 at the traffic light.

235
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:12,560
 (laughing)

236
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,400
 - That's not what you're supposed to use your heart for.

237
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,040
 Tell people that lights have changed.

238
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:15,880
 - No, that's true.

239
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:17,640
 It's only if there's an imminent threat to life,

240
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:18,480
 isn't it, that you're meant to--

241
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:21,000
 - Yeah, to let someone know where you are as well.

242
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:21,840
 - Right, yeah, yeah.

243
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,160
 - So you are letting them know where you are.

244
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:26,880
 You're saying, "I'm here and I'm not happy about it."

245
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:27,720
 Birds.

246
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,440
 - I feel like ab migration.

247
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,560
 - What's that? - Ab migration.

248
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:31,800
 - Ab migration.

249
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,720
 It's basically when you're a bird

250
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,760
 and you're migrating from one place to another,

251
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,920
 but you accidentally join the wrong flock

252
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:40,360
 and you just follow them to wherever they're going

253
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:43,000
 and you end up in complete with the wrong part of the world.

254
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,600
 - Oh, so they don't realize there's not a halfway through.

255
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,440
 - No, until they get there.

256
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,280
 - Yeah, right.

257
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,200
 - Oh, shit.

258
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,480
 - There's no one I can track here.

259
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:51,600
 (laughing)

260
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,440
 Does that really happen?

261
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:54,320
 - It does happen, yeah.

262
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,560
 - I, this is a very old fact,

263
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,040
 but I discovered it's not on our show.

264
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:59,400
 So I'm just plopping it in our show

265
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:00,240
 'cause it's something we all know.

266
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,200
 But in France, if your pet snail gets a train,

267
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,640
 it needs its own ticket.

268
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:06,840
 It has to pay for a ticket and it costs seven euro.

269
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:07,680
 - Seven euro.

270
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:10,480
 - Seven euro, which is, a dog is 20.

271
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,320
 So--

272
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,160
 - Do you think that's cheap?

273
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,200
 - Well, it depends where you're going to.

274
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,440
 But if you're going all the way from, you know,

275
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:19,680
 niece to breast, seven euros is an absolute steal.

276
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:20,960
 - But not for a snail.

277
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:23,000
 - Well, how long is it gonna take to walk?

278
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,960
 (laughing)

279
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:26,800
 - I guess.

280
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,680
 You're just so used to hearing about European trains

281
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:31,360
 being so cheap and amazing and, you know.

282
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,200
 Well, that's striking.

283
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,600
 I mean, especially 'cause if you've got a few snails,

284
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,720
 that'll rack up quite quickly.

285
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,520
 Well, what I'm confused about is one person

286
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:37,520
 is only allowed one animal.

287
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:38,760
 So one animal per person.

288
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:40,720
 So, right, I think you're only allowed

289
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,480
 your favorite snail to come.

290
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,360
 - You must be able to claim it's a wild snail.

291
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:45,800
 If you just put the snail down next to you

292
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:46,840
 and say, "It's nothing to do with me."

293
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:47,680
 (laughing)

294
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,880
 - Yeah, but then he gets kicked off for fair evasion

295
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,600
 and then you've lost your favorite snail.

296
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,880
 - He's like, "Anna, Anna!"

297
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:53,960
 (laughing)

298
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,560
 We've known each other for years!

299
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:56,560
 (laughing)

300
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:57,920
 - Honestly, it's a different Anna.

301
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:00,200
 (laughing)

302
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,360
 James, did you, sorry, I have to ask.

303
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:05,400
 When you just used the example of going from niece to breast,

304
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:06,240
 was it 'cause in your head,

305
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,680
 you were saying the words, "Nice breast."

306
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:08,840
 (laughing)

307
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,440
 - Great question, great question.

308
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,720
 - That's what I've assumed.

309
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:12,920
 You've just got nice breast,

310
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:14,840
 nice breast going through your head at all times,

311
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:16,760
 and you thought, "I can use this."

312
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:18,600
 - Genuinely, I thought of what is the most

313
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,240
 southeasterly town and what is the most

314
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,800
 north-westernly town I could think of.

315
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:22,640
 And that was it.

316
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:23,680
 - Okay. - That is good.

317
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:24,800
 - Yeah, very strong.

318
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:25,640
 - I have a link.

319
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:26,480
 I have a link.

320
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:27,320
 - Yeah.

321
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,160
 - Patricia Highsmith, the writer.

322
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,520
 - Oh, yeah. - Of the town of Mr. Ripley.

323
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:31,040
 Didn't she keep pet snails?

324
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:33,320
 - I think she would turn up places with them in a handbag,

325
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:35,120
 and I think she would let them crawl around her.

326
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,320
 - I think she hid some under her breasts

327
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:39,240
 when she was going from one country to another,

328
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:40,240
 so she didn't have to.

329
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,080
 - Yeah, exactly. - Really?

330
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,400
 - Oh, there you go. - Her nice breasts.

331
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,320
 So there we go. - Yeah.

332
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,400
 - We've come full circle.

333
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:46,800
 - There we are. - And we have my train.

334
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,640
 - Birds and trains.

335
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:49,680
 - Yeah.

336
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,840
 - So Japanese trains.

337
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:53,000
 What's the first thing you think?

338
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:53,840
 - Fast.

339
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:54,680
 - Shinkansen.

340
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:55,520
 - Fast.

341
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:56,920
 - Exactly, you've all said the right thing.

342
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:57,760
 - Fast. - On time.

343
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:58,600
 - Shinkansen, bullet train.

344
00:10:58,600 --> 00:10:59,800
 No, no, no, stop.

345
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:00,640
 - I know more.

346
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,880
 - Well, fair enough.

347
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,240
 There was a problem with the bullet trains, right?

348
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,480
 They were very, they were fast.

349
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:06,840
 That was great.

350
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:09,280
 But they were causing these sonic booms

351
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:10,280
 when they came out of tunnels

352
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:11,960
 'cause they pushed the air ahead

353
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,120
 and like a cork out of a bottle,

354
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,280
 the air just pops out really loud,

355
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:16,560
 hundreds of meters away.

356
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:17,640
 It was so loud.

357
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:21,440
 It was like miserable to live anywhere near these trains.

358
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:24,120
 And they were on overhead wires as well.

359
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:26,840
 And then the chief engineer who was called A.G. Nakatsu,

360
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:29,600
 he was interested in owls and how owls move quietly

361
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,400
 'cause owls have these little structures

362
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:33,760
 on their feathers called fimbrii.

363
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,440
 - They make like vortices and stuff.

364
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,160
 - Exactly, they break down the air

365
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:39,680
 into sort of micro-turbulances.

366
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:42,000
 And he said to his team, "This is the future."

367
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,920
 And every Japanese train has an owl strapped to the front.

368
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:48,240
 That's right.

369
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,720
 It's very cruel.

370
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:51,960
 - And instead of a holland, they go, "Whoo-hoo!"

371
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:55,920
 - So there are these wing grafts put on the trains

372
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,880
 and then to deal with the train coming out of the tunnel

373
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:01,240
 and having the sort of cork popping sonic boom effect,

374
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:02,360
 he looked to kingfishers

375
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:04,840
 'cause they dive into the water with no splash.

376
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:07,080
 If you've ever seen a really slow image of a video

377
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:09,720
 of kingfishers just dive again, no ripple.

378
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:11,720
 So he changed the body shape of the front of the train

379
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:14,200
 and they are quieter and they have less air resistance,

380
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:16,640
 they use less energy, they cost less, they use less fuel.

381
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:18,600
 - You know what birds also do, fly.

382
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,560
 So he could have put wings on it.

383
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:23,360
 (all laughing)

384
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,800
 - Yeah, and it all came from that?

385
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:26,640
 - Very cool.

386
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:27,880
 - All the trains are based on birds.

387
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:28,720
 - Basically birds.

388
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:29,560
 - Oh, yeah.

389
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:32,920
 - In China, they have a tunnel

390
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:35,800
 that they're building at the moment for trains.

391
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:38,560
 It's 12 meters across this tunnel,

392
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:41,840
 but due to the movement of the Earth's crust,

393
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:44,880
 it's shrinking and it's currently now

394
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:47,000
 less than three meters across.

395
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:47,840
 - What?

396
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,720
 - Because the Earth's plates are squishing it together.

397
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:50,560
 - Oh no.

398
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:52,120
 - Isn't that amazing?

399
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:53,240
 - That's incredible.

400
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:55,080
 - Hang on, so this is a train tunnel

401
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,440
 that was built 12 meters across.

402
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:58,520
 - They're currently in the middle of building it.

403
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:01,760
 It was supposed to be ready to go in like next year,

404
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:04,000
 but they keep going back and it's smaller again.

405
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:04,840
 - How can I be confusing?

406
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:06,600
 Do you think you were unpunked or something?

407
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,280
 You were like, what is going on?

408
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:09,120
 This was massive.

409
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,520
 - Are they gonna have to make the train

410
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:14,240
 one of those very small novelty steam trains?

411
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,840
 - Everybody off the big train.

412
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:20,000
 Isn't that weird?

413
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:20,840
 - That's so good.

414
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:22,640
 - And they put loads of concrete supports in,

415
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:23,840
 they just got smashed.

416
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:26,200
 - Yeah, 'cause these are tectonic plates.

417
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,040
 - Are they moving that?

418
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:29,200
 I didn't know bits of Earth were moving that fast.

419
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,400
 - Well, let me introduce you to Earthquakes.

420
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:32,240
 - Nice.

421
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,080
 - It's nice to meet you.

422
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,280
 (laughing)

423
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,640
 - But this is, yeah, I mean,

424
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:37,680
 there are some parts of the Earth that are moving.

425
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,280
 I mean, this is not like moving.

426
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:40,520
 You can't see it moving.

427
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:41,760
 - And they're still sticking with it?

428
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,080
 They're not just gonna get a new mountain.

429
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,040
 - I think what they're gonna do at the moment

430
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:44,960
 is they're just gonna wait

431
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:47,040
 and hopefully it's gonna stop moving soon

432
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,720
 and then they're gonna be able to build it.

433
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:50,560
 - Wow.

434
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:51,520
 - Just predict, nearby.

435
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:52,720
 - Well, hang on, hang on, hang on.

436
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,400
 - All they need to do is wait long enough

437
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,880
 and then the movement will go so much

438
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:57,880
 that the tunnel will--

439
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:58,920
 - Start making itself.

440
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:00,560
 - It will reverse, exactly.

441
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,400
 And it'll start getting bigger again.

442
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:03,800
 'Cause all the concrete will have gone through

443
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:04,640
 to the other side.

444
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:05,480
 Do you see what I mean?

445
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:06,520
 - That makes no more sense

446
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:08,040
 with the accompanying hand gestures

447
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:10,520
 that we can see than it does to the listener.

448
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:11,800
 - Okay, fine, fine.

449
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:14,520
 - Do you know the Snowdon Mountain Railway?

450
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,120
 So for the broad listeners,

451
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:18,000
 there's Snowdonia is the highest mountain in Wales

452
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,080
 and has a train going up it,

453
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:21,040
 which is kind of famous

454
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,880
 'cause it's a way you can cheat to get to the top.

455
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,960
 But did you guys know that it was built in the 1890s

456
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:26,360
 and it's very first trip.

457
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:27,680
 All the trains on it crashed

458
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,400
 and out to close immediately for a year.

459
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:30,240
 - Oh no, no.

460
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,080
 - For a year.

461
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:33,040
 - Yeah, 1896.

462
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,200
 So there were two trains

463
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,560
 that went on this inaugural journey.

464
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:36,920
 They got off the top of Snowdon.

465
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:39,560
 One was released to go down.

466
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:40,480
 They completely lost control.

467
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,120
 The engine of it derailed

468
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:43,280
 and the driver and the guy

469
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:45,240
 who was spooning coal into it or whatever,

470
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:47,240
 both leapt off it.

471
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:48,080
 - Shuffling?

472
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:48,920
 - Shuffling.

473
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:50,920
 - Spooning coal.

474
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:53,000
 We can't get the power it's so in.

475
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,120
 Use the dessert spoon.

476
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,720
 Stop with the teaspoon.

477
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:56,720
 - Oh, I thought differently.

478
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:59,280
 I thought whether the conductor is in bed with coal.

479
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:02,680
 Stop hugging that coal and get out here.

480
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:06,000
 - Yeah, look, I don't work in the rail industry.

481
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:06,840
 - Stoking.

482
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:07,840
 - Stoking.

483
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,720
 The stoker and the driver

484
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:11,400
 both threw themselves off the engine

485
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:13,000
 just as it flew over a cliff

486
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,400
 and hulled down onto the, you know, ground below.

487
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:16,240
 - Wow.

488
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:17,080
 - A few hundred meters.

489
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:20,120
 And then the carriage is careering down on its own.

490
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:20,960
 - Oh, my goodness.

491
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:21,800
 - The rail.

492
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:22,920
 So all these passengers are on the carriage.

493
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:25,400
 - But ahead, there's a point.

494
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,360
 And there are five people strapped to the track.

495
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:30,120
 (laughing)

496
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:31,840
 - There was actually, there was one,

497
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:32,960
 there was a one death

498
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:35,160
 because there was one guy on the carriage

499
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:39,400
 who saw the driver and stoker leap off the engine.

500
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:40,680
 So the guy in the carriage thought,

501
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:42,040
 well, I better do that as well.

502
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:43,600
 So he just threw himself out of the carriage

503
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,120
 and sadly plummeted into his death.

504
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,360
 - I know it's a use in the one who died, right?

505
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:48,800
 - Whereas the rest of the carriages eventually slowed down.

506
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,200
 - Once they entered a tunnel,

507
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:52,960
 which gradually grew closer.

508
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:54,000
 Riding them to a halt.

509
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,580
 (upbeat music)

510
00:15:56,580 --> 00:16:01,680
 - Okay, it is time for fact number two.

511
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:03,080
 And that is Andy.

512
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:04,880
 My fact is that in 1827,

513
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,440
 a shop opened in Cincinnati

514
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:09,600
 where the principal currency was time itself.

515
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,360
 (laughing)

516
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:13,200
 - I'm just remembering,

517
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,720
 we only let you do this fact, didn't we?

518
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,200
 Because we knew you would do that.

519
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,240
 - Yeah, we wanted to see. - We wanted to see.

520
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:18,920
 - Yeah, and you did.

521
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:19,920
 - It's a good fact as well.

522
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:20,760
 - Thank you.

523
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:22,800
 This is a place called the Cincinnati Time Store

524
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:26,120
 and it was created by a guy called Josiah Warren,

525
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:28,560
 who was a utopian and a socialist.

526
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:31,160
 And he would now be described as an anarchist,

527
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:33,160
 but I don't think the phrase really existed at the time.

528
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:34,800
 Basically, his idea was,

529
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:37,000
 I'm going to sell things for what they cost me.

530
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,320
 And the only thing I'm going to add to the price

531
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:43,120
 is the value of the time I've spent on this stuff.

532
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:45,360
 So he claimed basically labor

533
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,800
 was the only true currency, if you like.

534
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:50,080
 - So it's like the time of people coming into the shop

535
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:51,120
 and deciding what to get,

536
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,640
 the time of him wrapping it up,

537
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:54,040
 the time of him weighing stuff,

538
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:56,200
 the time of him bringing stuff from the back room

539
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,720
 into the front light, all that kind of stuff.

540
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:59,600
 - All of that, and it involves quite a lot of calculation.

541
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:00,880
 And also, I love this,

542
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,640
 the longer he spent with the customer,

543
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:04,880
 the more it would cost the customer

544
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,520
 because his time was worth money.

545
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:08,560
 - So if I'm behind that customer

546
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:10,320
 that's taking so much time,

547
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:11,520
 (laughing)

548
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:12,840
 do I have to pay less or?

549
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:14,120
 - Yeah, they haven't noticed.

550
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:17,600
 You're in your car, do you honk your horn?

551
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:18,520
 Even though it's costing.

552
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:20,080
 I think he had a timer dial

553
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:22,760
 so that as he stayed in the shop for ages saying,

554
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:25,120
 "Oh, I don't know if I want the big one or the small one."

555
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:28,240
 - Yeah, it's sort of notch up because this is his time.

556
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:29,880
 - It actually seems more aggressive

557
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:32,560
 even though it's a utopian, cheapening thing.

558
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:35,160
 - But he said that it went through so many customers

559
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:36,480
 since such a quick amount of time

560
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,440
 that he could shut the shop halfway through the day

561
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:40,280
 because he'd done basically the full days

562
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:42,080
 worth of money that he needed to earn.

563
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:43,400
 - Yeah, which is pretty nuts.

564
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:45,000
 You can't do that with a shop.

565
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
 What if I want to get to the shop at 3.30

566
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,320
 and they've just closed at mid-dig?

567
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:50,040
 So they've gone, "We've had enough customers for the day."

568
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:51,960
 - Well, go to like a square capitalist shop

569
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:54,480
 and not to the utopian anarchist.

570
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:55,320
 - That's fine.

571
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:56,160
 He was also, and I don't think

572
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,440
 this is how he'd like to be characterised,

573
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:59,880
 but he was just like a modern day lawyer

574
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:01,440
 in the sense of time, wasn't he?

575
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:02,280
 - Yeah.

576
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:03,320
 - 'Cause that's what you get with lawyers.

577
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:04,320
 The more time he spent with them,

578
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,160
 the more they charge.

579
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,000
 You're having--

580
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,160
 - And sex workers.

581
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,000
 (laughing)

582
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:08,840
 - And sex workers.

583
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:09,760
 So you've got to rush through both, haven't you?

584
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:10,600
 - I assume.

585
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:12,120
 (laughing)

586
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:14,280
 Never used a lawyer, so I'm not sure if that's the same.

587
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:15,840
 (laughing)

588
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:18,120
 For the first few days when he opened it,

589
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:19,960
 he didn't have a single customer.

590
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:20,800
 - Really?

591
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,800
 - Yeah, and he asked his brother, George,

592
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:25,480
 to come and make some purchases for his family.

593
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:26,320
 - Clever.

594
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:28,080
 - And then George came and told his friends

595
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:30,320
 and then George's friends came.

596
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:31,320
 And then in the first week,

597
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:33,880
 he'd made $5 worth of sales.

598
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:34,720
 - Is that a lot?

599
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,760
 It was in the 18s, 20s, wasn't it?

600
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:39,440
 - Even in those days, it wasn't enough to live off,

601
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:42,240
 but it took off relatively quickly after that.

602
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:45,040
 There was a guy who had another shop around McCona,

603
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,440
 who kind of came in and said,

604
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:48,160
 "You're putting me out of business, mate."

605
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,000
 - Yeah.

606
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:49,840
 - Oh, really?

607
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,960
 - And he said, "Well, maybe you could show me how to do it."

608
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:53,560
 And Josiah Warren, so I said,

609
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:55,080
 "Okay, well this is what I'm doing."

610
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:56,960
 And the guy copied his system.

611
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:59,240
 - I think the idea is that time also

612
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:01,000
 has a slightly variable value.

613
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,080
 So nobody profits from anyone else's labor is the idea.

614
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:06,640
 You don't get to just add a huge whack

615
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,120
 to the amount of time you spend on something

616
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:10,120
 because the time is the currency.

617
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:12,280
 But also, if a job is harder or more disgusting,

618
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:14,320
 I think it would be worth more time.

619
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,760
 So for example, I love making the show.

620
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:19,720
 So probably an hour and a half recording,

621
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:21,640
 I will actually only get paid half an hour of time

622
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:23,120
 because it's so much fun to do.

623
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,200
 - We're responding to the emails that people send in.

624
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,040
 How much would you--

625
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:28,800
 - A quintuple, yeah, I'll make it back.

626
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,880
 - That's why I get paid five times as much as you, isn't it, Andy?

627
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,040
 I hate making this show.

628
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:34,680
 So two hours recording, I actually get paid.

629
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:36,280
 - Do you know why that was the case?

630
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:39,040
 Because actually, this idea was not new.

631
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:41,080
 But the reason that he had different amounts

632
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:43,360
 of different people is because he'd previously been

633
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:47,120
 in another utopia called New Harmony.

634
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,800
 And at New Harmony, that had failed

635
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:52,320
 because anyone who was good at like building houses

636
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:54,840
 just decided, wait a minute, I'm getting paid the same

637
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:57,120
 as the people who are doing something

638
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,560
 which isn't skillful at all.

639
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:00,800
 And actually, it all fell apart because of that.

640
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:03,800
 And so he decided that his new utopias and new ideas

641
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:05,080
 were gonna be slightly different

642
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:06,480
 and have a slightly different thing

643
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:09,160
 where different skills paid different amounts.

644
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:11,200
 - So he took over this small little town

645
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,920
 called Modern Times.

646
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,040
 - The place is called Modern Times.

647
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:16,040
 - It's called Modern Times, it's a name.

648
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:18,520
 They had like 150 people who signed up

649
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:20,320
 to the idea of living in this utopia.

650
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,400
 - So that started off a bit dodgily

651
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:26,320
 because he had this big group of people who were all utopians.

652
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:28,840
 And then one of them began to advocate

653
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:31,400
 for plurality of wives.

654
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:34,960
 Another one believed that clothing was a superfluity.

655
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,840
 So he didn't have to wear any clothes.

656
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:38,520
 And there was another one who thought

657
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:40,480
 that actually you shouldn't really eat properly,

658
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,400
 you should just eat beans and nothing else.

659
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,240
 - Oh no.

660
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:45,600
 - And yeah, it was basically attracted all these people

661
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:48,800
 who had all these different ideas outside of the mainstream.

662
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:50,840
 And at the very start, it went really badly

663
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:53,640
 and the newspapers were saying this is gonna be a disaster

664
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:55,480
 but it did prosper in the end.

665
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:56,320
 - Did it?

666
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:59,480
 Even though it sounds like a load of farty naked sleazy men.

667
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:02,560
 - They got rid of the farty ones and the sleazy ones.

668
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:03,400
 - Okay.

669
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:05,080
 - They got rid of the dwarfs.

670
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:07,000
 (all laughing)

671
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,680
 And then in the end it did falter

672
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:11,280
 but it was because there was a huge panic

673
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:15,000
 in the mid-19th century and then the civil war

674
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,600
 and then that was where it fell apart.

675
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:17,440
 - Yeah.

676
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:20,840
 But it did according to their like press, you know,

677
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:22,800
 it went for 13 years solidly.

678
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:24,280
 They didn't have government, they didn't have law,

679
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:28,800
 no police, but they didn't have any reported crime or violence.

680
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:29,760
 - Well, if you've got no law,

681
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:31,000
 you're not gonna have any reported crime.

682
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,800
 - Yeah, that's just from supposedly the people.

683
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:35,440
 - A naked man stole my third wife.

684
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:38,440
 (all laughing)

685
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:41,960
 - Josiah Warren also invented a lamp, time lamp.

686
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:44,040
 Just a non-time lamp.

687
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:45,960
 It burned over time, but again,

688
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:48,680
 it had a utopian idea at its core,

689
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:49,840
 which was to save people money.

690
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:51,720
 So it was made of lard instead of tallow

691
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:54,640
 and it burned much more efficiently.

692
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,640
 But the good thing about this lamp

693
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:59,560
 is that the patent for it was destroyed

694
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:03,400
 in a fire at the patent factory in 1836.

695
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:04,480
 - That's very funny.

696
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:07,120
 Isn't that true of like the fire extinguisher?

697
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:09,040
 - That's correct, it's the same fire.

698
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:09,960
 - It was the same fire.

699
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:12,800
 - Well, it was this huge, it was an incredibly famous fire

700
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,920
 and there are these things called the ex patents,

701
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:16,840
 which are the first 10,000 patents.

702
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:18,880
 And I know I should be saying patents, sorry,

703
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:21,520
 but the first 10,000 patents ever issued

704
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,720
 and they were all destroyed in this fire,

705
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:26,440
 this massive fire at the US patent office.

706
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:28,040
 - It feels like there's a good plot for a movie

707
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:30,320
 or something in there where they're rediscovered

708
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:31,920
 actually that we've made copies.

709
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:33,280
 - Yeah. - Someone made copies

710
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:35,400
 and all these new technologies turn up.

711
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:37,760
 - Yeah, the ex patent man.

712
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:38,600
 - Yeah, that's quite good.

713
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:39,720
 - That's excellent.

714
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:42,640
 - He made a newspaper as well, Warren, in 1833.

715
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:44,000
 So a few years after the shop,

716
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,160
 for which he built his own printing press

717
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:48,480
 and cast all the type himself.

718
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:50,960
 He does seem to have been very practical, practically minded.

719
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:53,240
 - He also invented a new kind of music.

720
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:55,320
 - Did he, what was that?

721
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:56,160
 - Wrap.

722
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:58,000
 (all laughing)

723
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:58,840
 - Gangster rap.

724
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:01,960
 - No, it was called mathematical notation.

725
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:02,800
 - Okay.

726
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:04,680
 - And it was a way of using maths

727
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:07,000
 as opposed to using do-re-mi-far-sol-r-t-do

728
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,280
 was using numbers.

729
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:09,640
 - How interesting.

730
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:12,760
 He's described as an anarchist

731
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:15,960
 and my impression of an anarchist is very different

732
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:18,000
 to what it sounds like he was.

733
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,400
 - What do you think of an anarchist?

734
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:21,600
 - I guess an anarchist would be someone who's raising hell,

735
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,400
 like suffragettes were being anarchists

736
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:25,600
 when they were bombing places.

737
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,320
 - And that's a metaphorical anarchist.

738
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:28,160
 - Yeah, right.

739
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:30,200
 - An anarchist would be just someone who doesn't believe

740
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:33,240
 there should be any leaders in society.

741
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:34,840
 - Suffragettes are very much not anarchist

742
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:37,800
 'cause they wanted to actively get into the role

743
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:39,680
 of electing leaders, yes.

744
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:40,520
 - It's very weird.

745
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:42,960
 So anarchism is, 'cause everyone calls for an anarchist,

746
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:45,680
 is this big school of thought, exactly as James says,

747
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:47,680
 it's not, we don't want leaders,

748
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:49,480
 no sort of state structures,

749
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:51,160
 people doing things for themselves and their neighbors

750
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:53,120
 is the basic idea behind it.

751
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:55,480
 But also there is a kind of extreme end of it

752
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:57,760
 in the 1890s, it was a big worry across Europe,

753
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:01,080
 the anarchists, who were mostly basically young men

754
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:03,720
 throwing these kind of like classic bombs,

755
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:05,560
 which are sort of big back black wool.

756
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:06,400
 - Cherry bombs.

757
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,000
 - Yeah, with bomb written on the side

758
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,120
 and with a fuse sticking out of it

759
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:11,920
 and throwing them at sort of elected leaders

760
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:13,440
 or royals across Europe.

761
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:14,520
 - Wiley Coyote.

762
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:17,040
 - Yeah, it is like that, but it was a genuine fear

763
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:19,520
 'cause that was the sort of extreme end of anarchism.

764
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:20,880
 But President William McKinley,

765
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,440
 one of the four presidents assassinated,

766
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:23,920
 shot by an anarchist.

767
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:26,640
 And his assassin was a guy called Leon Chogosh,

768
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:29,000
 who was, this is very dark, this,

769
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,440
 he was tried and executed.

770
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:35,160
 And then his body was destroyed by acid

771
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:37,480
 so that fellow anarchists wouldn't have a body to venerate

772
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:38,920
 or to turn into a martyr.

773
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:41,720
 So they literally poured acid into the coffin.

774
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:42,560
 - Wow.

775
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:43,400
 - Put it in the coffin, close the coffin up,

776
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:45,560
 pour acid in, and then burned all his clothes

777
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:46,760
 and possessions after that.

778
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:47,600
 - Wow.

779
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:48,440
 - I know.

780
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:49,280
 - Don't do that again.

781
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:51,400
 (laughing)

782
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:52,560
 - And then we get the sex pistols,

783
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:55,560
 kind of calms down the world of Anarchy, doesn't it?

784
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:56,400
 - Yeah.

785
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,240
 - The illusion of an anarchist.

786
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:58,200
 - If you buy it, if you buy a t-shirt of it,

787
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:00,080
 it's not as anarchic as, yeah.

788
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:01,880
 (laughing)

789
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:05,120
 - I was looking into the idea of swapping money for time

790
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:07,000
 and seeing if that's been used anywhere else.

791
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,240
 And I found an example,

792
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:12,040
 which is something that's been trialed in 2019 in Estonia.

793
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:13,880
 They've had a huge problem with speeding drivers.

794
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:16,160
 So people are speeding, they're getting tickets,

795
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:17,960
 and then they are just paying the fine

796
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:19,200
 because they can afford to do it.

797
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,800
 And so in Estonia, they thought,

798
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:22,320
 instead of giving them a fine,

799
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,200
 what if anyone who's caught speeding

800
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:27,080
 has to do a 45 to 60 minute timeout?

801
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:29,400
 And now they're really late to where they need to go.

802
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:30,560
 They have no choice but to do this.

803
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:31,400
 - That's great.

804
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:32,880
 - 57% of people actually said

805
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:35,240
 they preferred the idea of having the timeout.

806
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:36,680
 So the biggest problem they have is,

807
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:38,240
 - Meanwhile, James has pulled in behind the guy

808
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:39,560
 who's been stopped for speeding.

809
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:40,400
 He doesn't mind.

810
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,640
 (laughing)

811
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:46,120
 - How are you policing that?

812
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:48,600
 - This is what they're trying to work out

813
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:49,920
 because it takes a lot of people

814
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:51,600
 to have to sit there for an hour.

815
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,120
 It's not practical, but it's a great idea

816
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:55,680
 because no matter how rich you are, time is time,

817
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:57,360
 you can't get past that.

818
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:58,200
 - It's not practical, guys.

819
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:59,040
 Well, what you could do is,

820
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:01,040
 you could put some clamps on the car

821
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:02,080
 and so they can't go anywhere

822
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:03,920
 and then come back an hour later and take it off.

823
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:06,080
 - But most speeders are called by cameras, aren't they?

824
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:07,440
 Maybe out of every camera,

825
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:11,280
 it could drop a sort of big net that catches the car.

826
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:12,760
 - Yeah, that's much more practical.

827
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:14,760
 - Yes, I'm a craxit.

828
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:17,120
 - Hiring some unemployed people to do the same work.

829
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:20,320
 Kind of like detention for grown-ups, basically.

830
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:23,000
 - I have a related fact because it's about Estonia.

831
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:29,520
 I was in Estonia relatively recently, last year in Tallinn,

832
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:32,560
 and I went to the Museum of Banned Books.

833
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:33,400
 - Oh, cool, yeah.

834
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:35,800
 - So it's a museum, but it's also a shop.

835
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:38,600
 You can buy books that have been banned from around the world.

836
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:40,880
 And I asked for one particular book

837
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:44,560
 and they had it hidden behind the desk,

838
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:46,440
 as it wasn't on display.

839
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:48,880
 Can you guess what the book is?

840
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:51,320
 So they had every banned book from around the world.

841
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:52,720
 And I said, "Oh, do you have this one?"

842
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:54,880
 And they went, "We do, but it's behind the desk.

843
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,120
 We're not allowed to put it on display."

844
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:57,320
 Oh, we're not putting it on display.

845
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:58,160
 - Is it a famous book?

846
00:26:58,160 --> 00:26:59,240
 Will you definitely have heard of it?

847
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:00,920
 - It's famous, but whether you've heard of it,

848
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:02,120
 I don't know. - How?

849
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:04,720
 - I mean, it's very on topic from what we're talking about.

850
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:07,680
 - Oh, okay, so a time-related thing maybe.

851
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:09,160
 - Or an anarchist's book.

852
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:10,200
 - The anarchist's cookbook.

853
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:11,880
 - Correct. - Oh!

854
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:16,160
 - The anarchist's cookbook is in the Museum of Banned Books,

855
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:18,120
 but isn't on display. - Why not?

856
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:19,920
 - Because it's so dangerous.

857
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:21,360
 - What is it? - What is it?

858
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:24,800
 - It's a way of making bombs, basically.

859
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:25,640
 - Okay.

860
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:28,200
 - Also making illicit drugs,

861
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:31,720
 ways of freaking telecommunication devices.

862
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:34,640
 So this was written by a guy called Powell,

863
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,360
 whose first name I can't remember,

864
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:40,240
 but anyway, he reneged on it when he got older.

865
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:43,000
 It was published in 1971, and by 1976,

866
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,560
 he'd converted to Anglicanism

867
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:47,280
 and tried to get his book taken from circulation.

868
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:50,440
 And in 2011, he and his wife,

869
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:51,920
 Och and Kasuma Powell,

870
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:54,880
 founded a thing called Next Frontier Inclusion,

871
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:57,160
 which was a non-profit organization for children

872
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:58,960
 with learning disabilities.

873
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:01,720
 But he did that in a way to atone for this book

874
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:03,920
 that he'd written, which he can't control

875
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:05,840
 because he doesn't own the copyright to it anymore.

876
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:07,760
 It's out there, and that's it.

877
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:09,360
 - Did he do an anarchist thing with the copyright

878
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:10,640
 or something, or did it just,

879
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:11,680
 it just got out of there and it's been replicated?

880
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:13,760
 - No, it was the amount of time

881
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:16,040
 it just sort of went to the publisher.

882
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:19,320
 - Silly boy, think before you publish.

883
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:20,640
 - I really thought you were going to say

884
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,160
 the book that you couldn't access, James,

885
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:23,640
 was Tintin and the Soviets.

886
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:24,960
 - Oh, that is true.

887
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:27,200
 Like, I went to the Tintin shop in London

888
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:29,040
 and they wouldn't, they would sell it to me,

889
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,720
 but again, it was not on display.

890
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:33,120
 - You have a knack of finding things behind the counter.

891
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:34,440
 (laughing)

892
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:35,760
 It's interesting.

893
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:39,280
 You can work out what will most freak out any shopkeeper.

894
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:41,040
 - But that they will own, you know.

895
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:42,640
 - But they will own, yeah, yeah, yeah.

896
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:44,120
 - I was just looking at money,

897
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:46,080
 the times when money's been abolished.

898
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:47,800
 Do you know the only country to abolish money?

899
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:50,480
 - Oh, I'm going to say Bhutan.

900
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:52,480
 - Oh, I have some boots of these kinds.

901
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:56,120
 - Okay, I'd like to change my choice to,

902
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:57,560
 let's say a communist one.

903
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:58,400
 - Yeah.

904
00:28:58,400 --> 00:28:59,240
 - Cuba.

905
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:01,360
 - Oh, no, Angola.

906
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:02,200
 - You've got the right,

907
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:03,440
 and he's got the right first letter.

908
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:05,760
 It's definitely less utopian than Bhutan.

909
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,160
 - Columbia.

910
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:08,600
 - Well, it's, I'm just going to tell you.

911
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:10,560
 Same number of syllables.

912
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:11,400
 - Begins with C.

913
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:12,240
 - Yep. - Begins with C.

914
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:13,560
 - All syllables. - Columbia.

915
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:15,480
 - Oh, no, it's, yeah, same number of syllables.

916
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:16,880
 Four syllables. - Four syllables.

917
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:17,840
 - Cambodia.

918
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:19,680
 - Very good.

919
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:20,760
 - Under the Khmerz, was it?

920
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:23,320
 - Cambodia, under the Khmerz, Pol Pot,

921
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:27,240
 who decided to ban money in 1975 when he came into power,

922
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:30,040
 and within three weeks, there was a new currency,

923
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:33,120
 but then he decided that he didn't want a new currency,

924
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:35,040
 so he blew up the central bank.

925
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:38,800
 I mean, obviously he did some absolutely appalling things

926
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:41,880
 alongside this, but yeah, blew up the central bank,

927
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:44,240
 and money flooded through the streets,

928
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:45,920
 and people were using it because Cambodia

929
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:48,200
 was in a terrible state by that point because of them.

930
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:50,760
 We were burning money for fire and warrants.

931
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:52,600
 - How interesting, wow. - Because it didn't exist.

932
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:53,720
 - When I was in Cambodia,

933
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:55,480
 which I admittedly was quite a while ago,

934
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:57,640
 you would really just buy stuff in dollars.

935
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:59,560
 - Yeah, same, yeah.

936
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:03,240
 Do you know the commonest denomination of US dollars?

937
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:05,320
 - One dollar, it must be one dollar.

938
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:07,520
 - Used to be, in 2016, it was replaced.

939
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:08,720
 It's now the second most common.

940
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:11,680
 - I'm going to go all the way, the thousand dollar.

941
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:14,120
 - I'm going to go in the middle, the seven dollar.

942
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:15,920
 (laughing)

943
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:18,400
 - And you've gone too far into the realms of unreality.

944
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:19,400
 - It's a hundred, it's going to be a hundred.

945
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:22,040
 - It's a hundred, it's the hundred dollar banknote.

946
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:23,320
 Isn't that insane?

947
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:25,760
 A hundred dollar bills make up almost 80%

948
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:27,440
 of the value of dollars worldwide,

949
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:30,360
 and they are now the most commonly circulated bill,

950
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:32,680
 and it's almost all held outside of the US.

951
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:34,000
 - It's a lot of crime though, isn't it?

952
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,240
 - It's a lot of crime. - It's a lot of art,

953
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:36,600
 fraudsters, and drug money,

954
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:39,600
 because it's large amounts of value in a relatively small--

955
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,200
 - Still counts. - It's finicky to do that

956
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:42,480
 with all one dollar bills, if you're paying for it.

957
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:43,320
 - Yeah.

958
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:46,200
 - Like 800 kilos of cocaine, and you're at the counter,

959
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:47,960
 and the guy in front of you is paying him once.

960
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:48,800
 It's annoying.

961
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:50,200
 (laughing)

962
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:52,640
 - James, just sitting there happily.

963
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:53,960
 - You take your time, buddy.

964
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:55,400
 - It's all right, I'm going to be buying this stuff

965
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:56,680
 he has behind the counter.

966
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:58,440
 (laughing)

967
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:01,020
 (upbeat music)

968
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:07,640
 - Okay, it is time for fact number three, and that is James.

969
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:10,920
 - Okay, my fact this week is that the 2023 Nobel Prize

970
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:13,840
 for Chemistry was won for discovering something

971
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:16,360
 that has been used in stained glass window making

972
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:18,080
 for a thousand years.

973
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:20,400
 Glass, it was.

974
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:22,080
 - Whoa. - Discovered that.

975
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:23,160
 - It was a really late award.

976
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:25,040
 - We didn't know where it came from before.

977
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:26,440
 - No one knew what glass was.

978
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:27,280
 - Amazing. - And then they were like,

979
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:28,600
 "Oh, it's in all those windows as well."

980
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:29,960
 No, it wasn't that.

981
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:31,440
 It was Quantum Dots.

982
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:38,080
 It was won by Maungi G. Bowendi, Louis E. Bruce,

983
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:42,760
 and Alexei Ekimov, and they discovered Quantum Dots,

984
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:45,520
 which are tiny, tiny particles.

985
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:49,560
 You fire light into them, and depending on their size,

986
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:51,800
 they re-emit light of a different color.

987
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:54,540
 It's all due to this thing we call science.

988
00:31:54,540 --> 00:31:55,960
 (laughing)

989
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:58,720
 Talking about that, and Quantum Science at that.

990
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:01,240
 We don't need to really go into all that stuff today,

991
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:03,240
 but scientists have looked at glass back

992
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:05,680
 from the 10th century and found tiny bits of gold,

993
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:08,520
 tiny bits of silver, and they act in the same way

994
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:09,760
 that Quantum Dots act.

995
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:12,400
 When the sunlight comes in, they enhance the red light

996
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:13,840
 and enhance the yellow light.

997
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:18,640
 - And it's the size of the Quantum Dot,

998
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:21,240
 which are only, there are a few nanometers across,

999
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:24,880
 and the bigger ones emit a different color

1000
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:26,840
 when light is fired at them than the smaller ones.

1001
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:28,680
 It's basically--

1002
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:31,360
 - It took quite a long time for me to understand it,

1003
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:33,120
 but there's a really good explanation in the article

1004
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:36,240
 that was sent by the American Chemical Society's president,

1005
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:38,960
 Judith Goyardun, G-I-O-R-T.

1006
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:41,440
 - Ironically, pronouncing her name is more difficult

1007
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:42,480
 than the Quantum Mechanics.

1008
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:45,640
 - Judith Jordan, and she says to think of it

1009
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:48,920
 like a little box, so basically the particle is the box,

1010
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:51,400
 and you have the electrons bashing off the sides

1011
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:53,440
 of the walls of the box on the inside,

1012
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:55,560
 but when you've got a big box, it's gonna take longer

1013
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:57,720
 for the electrons to bash into the size.

1014
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:59,480
 When the particle is shrunk down,

1015
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:01,240
 the electrons are bashing quicker and quicker,

1016
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:03,880
 and that's where it's emitting the different color, basically.

1017
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:06,360
 So it's to do with the size of the box

1018
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:08,400
 and the electrons smashing into the sides.

1019
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:10,320
 - It is hard, it's hard to understand.

1020
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:11,680
 - The thing is, they glow.

1021
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:13,040
 They're very exciting 'cause they glow,

1022
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:14,080
 and they're very colorful,

1023
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:15,920
 and the reason they've won the Nobel Prize

1024
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:18,800
 is 'cause they basically made television a bit better.

1025
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:20,640
 As far as I can tell.

1026
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:23,800
 - We're gonna have cool quantum tellies, QLEDs.

1027
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:28,120
 - QLEDs, and it's the same principle as a normal LED TV,

1028
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:31,560
 which is that light is shone from behind onto the dots.

1029
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:33,040
 They glow in different colors,

1030
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:34,840
 and you're watching your show

1031
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:36,040
 and you don't really need to think about it.

1032
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:38,160
 - But like if you think about an old computer screen

1033
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:40,920
 or something, you could only really get like blue

1034
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:43,320
 and yellow and magenta, like a printer.

1035
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:46,560
 You only get those colors, and to make any other color,

1036
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:48,280
 you have to mix them up in different amounts,

1037
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:50,320
 and you will be able to get a certain number of colors,

1038
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:53,800
 but these QLEDs can show you way more colors,

1039
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:56,000
 more colors than you could possibly imagine.

1040
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:56,960
 - Yes. - Yes.

1041
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:58,920
 - Like teal.

1042
00:33:58,920 --> 00:33:59,760
 - Wow. - Incredible.

1043
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:01,420
 - I can't imagine that. - Now with teals.

1044
00:34:01,420 --> 00:34:02,360
 - Incredible. - Yeah.

1045
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:03,200
 - And mauve.

1046
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:04,540
 - Yeah.

1047
00:34:04,540 --> 00:34:05,380
 - Puce.

1048
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:08,080
 - And we should just say in defense

1049
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:09,560
 of the Nobel Prize-winning scientists

1050
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:11,680
 that they are used for other things as well.

1051
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:14,000
 They're gonna hopefully revolutionize the world of medicine

1052
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,200
 because you're gonna be able to spot the colors

1053
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:17,360
 on the inside of the body,

1054
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:19,600
 so they're gonna be used for diagnosing certain bits

1055
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:20,440
 of the body. - What?

1056
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:22,040
 - Yeah. - How do you mean?

1057
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:24,560
 - I don't know if you've explained that the right way,

1058
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:26,560
 it's spot the colors on the inside of the body.

1059
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:29,200
 - Do you mean send markers into the body

1060
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:30,240
 that can identify- - Exactly.

1061
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:32,840
 - It's like, "Oh, you've got a green liver.

1062
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:35,760
 You've got an orange pancreas."

1063
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:38,360
 - It's the leave to highlight spots

1064
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:40,280
 where you need to monitor and make sure that things,

1065
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:41,840
 and that's the opening application of it,

1066
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:44,040
 just on nanotechnology and medicine,

1067
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:45,840
 and this is another cool use of nanotech.

1068
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:47,560
 This is nano shells.

1069
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:49,880
 So these are hollow gold or silver spheres

1070
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:51,000
 wrapped around silica.

1071
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:51,960
 Okay, so I think they are hollow,

1072
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:53,640
 but they're two layers. - Okay.

1073
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:56,360
 - Like a Ferrero Rocher, but small.

1074
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:58,920
 But so small that you could eat lots and it wouldn't matter.

1075
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:01,640
 So if you fire light at these nano shells,

1076
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:02,640
 they heat up massively,

1077
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:04,480
 'cause they're made of gold and silver, right?

1078
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:07,600
 So the idea is, if you have someone who's got cancer,

1079
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:11,240
 you can inject the tumor with these nano shells,

1080
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:13,200
 then you fire infrared light.

1081
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:16,440
 Now, the light passes through the water in your cells

1082
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:18,520
 because the water in your cells

1083
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:19,960
 doesn't absorb much infrared light.

1084
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:23,160
 These nano shells absorb huge amounts of infrared light.

1085
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:27,200
 They heat up massively and it kills the tumor off, right?

1086
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:28,440
 So if you can, yeah,

1087
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:31,320
 and they're experimenting at the moment on raw chicken,

1088
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:33,960
 but the hope is that it'll make the leap

1089
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:36,480
 from raw chicken to people.

1090
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:37,800
 It's a really clever idea.

1091
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:39,400
 - Are they basically cooking chicken

1092
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:41,120
 by putting these nano dots inside it?

1093
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:43,040
 - Effectively, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1094
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:43,880
 - That's clever.

1095
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:45,160
 - Very cool. - That's really good.

1096
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:46,000
 - It's a good idea.

1097
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,800
 - Quicker cooking in better tellies.

1098
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:51,840
 - When Ekimov first came up with the idea of quantum dots,

1099
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:55,920
 he was working at the Vavilyev State Optical Institute

1100
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,240
 in Soviet Russia.

1101
00:35:57,240 --> 00:36:00,560
 And he had got these special glass objects,

1102
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:04,080
 semiconductor glass objects, known as shot glasses.

1103
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:05,400
 - Whee!

1104
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:06,240
 - Sorry.

1105
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:07,080
 - Isn't that cool?

1106
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:08,400
 They were known as shot glasses

1107
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:09,640
 and they were lots of different colors

1108
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:12,200
 and he developed the theories to explain their color.

1109
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:14,000
 And the interesting thing about those shot glasses

1110
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:17,960
 is they were made by a company founded by Otto Schott.

1111
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:20,320
 Okay, and that company still exists

1112
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:25,320
 and they made 90% of the first one billion COVID vaccine bottles.

1113
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:26,800
 - Wow.

1114
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:29,400
 - So 90% of the first billion COVID vaccines

1115
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:31,120
 were delivered in shot glasses.

1116
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:33,360
 - Lovely, beautiful. - That's really cool.

1117
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:35,560
 - That's great, so funny.

1118
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:36,720
 - Ekimov, who you mentioned,

1119
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:39,640
 as you say, he was in Soviet Union in 1981

1120
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:42,280
 when he became, in fact, the first person, I think,

1121
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:44,960
 to generate these quantum dots and to identify them

1122
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:46,480
 and learn how to generate them.

1123
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:48,040
 But it's just one of those amazing things.

1124
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:50,000
 It's so weird how often you read about this,

1125
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,760
 I guess, when we do what we do,

1126
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:53,520
 things happening simultaneously.

1127
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:56,360
 It just shows how predictable a path humans are on, I think,

1128
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:58,400
 because is it Bruce?

1129
00:36:58,400 --> 00:36:59,440
 Do you pronounce it, do you know?

1130
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:00,560
 - That's how I pronounced it.

1131
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:01,800
 - Cool.

1132
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:02,720
 - It could be brew.

1133
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:03,680
 - Brew, okay.

1134
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:05,160
 - Fancy a brew?

1135
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:06,800
 - Fancy a brew in your shot glass.

1136
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:08,960
 - Is that Scottish?

1137
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:09,800
 - Scouts, I think.

1138
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:11,240
 - I don't know, I don't know.

1139
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:14,440
 (all laughing)

1140
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:16,800
 At exactly the same time in America,

1141
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:19,360
 Louis Bruce was working on the similar thing

1142
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:22,320
 and he came up with it pretty much a year later, I think.

1143
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:23,800
 And the interesting thing was,

1144
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:25,080
 I hadn't realised at the Soviet Union,

1145
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:26,480
 if you did science there at the time,

1146
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:27,920
 it basically didn't get anywhere

1147
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:30,920
 because you had to publish it in extremely obscure journals

1148
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:33,040
 that no Western scientists were really reading

1149
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:34,280
 'cause it was all thought it was a bit backwards.

1150
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:35,280
 - And in Russian as well.

1151
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:38,720
 - And in Russian, which, you know, a lot of us can't read.

1152
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:41,680
 And so Bruce, a year or two later,

1153
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:43,960
 read this thing in a journal and good on him,

1154
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:44,800
 he read it and was like,

1155
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:47,200
 "Oh, that guy's done the thing I did a bit before me."

1156
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:49,680
 So got in touch with him, wrote him a letter to say,

1157
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:50,520
 "Shall we hook up?"

1158
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:52,040
 - A very, what?

1159
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:52,880
 That's, wow.

1160
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:54,920
 - Then they had a beautiful romance blast.

1161
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:55,760
 - Wow.

1162
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:57,440
 (all laughing)

1163
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:00,280
 - Amongi Balwadi, who was the third person

1164
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:01,240
 who won the Nobel Prize,

1165
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:03,720
 failed his first chemistry test at Harvard.

1166
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:07,000
 And he was specifically the chemist who came on board

1167
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,480
 to sort of make what the other two had discovered

1168
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:11,320
 become practically applicable.

1169
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:13,480
 And yeah, he did a speech recently saying,

1170
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:14,520
 he failed the chemistry test

1171
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:17,040
 and actually got the worst grade in his whole class.

1172
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:19,320
 And said, "That could have destroyed me,

1173
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:21,600
 "but I decided that it wouldn't."

1174
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:23,640
 And it was such a...

1175
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:25,080
 - I decided that it wouldn't.

1176
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:26,400
 - I decided.

1177
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:27,480
 And that's the lesson.

1178
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:28,640
 Good luck, guys.

1179
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:31,760
 There was like, there's a book about archery,

1180
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:33,600
 about the best way to be an archer,

1181
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:34,560
 like a really old one.

1182
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:37,440
 And the first line is, "First, decide to succeed."

1183
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:39,360
 - Wow, that's so good.

1184
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:41,080
 - That's awesome.

1185
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:43,160
 I really like that these three winners, by the way,

1186
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:45,880
 they all advanced it in a slightly different way.

1187
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:47,240
 Each brought something new to it.

1188
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:50,040
 And I do like that the Nobel Prize system works like that,

1189
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:51,200
 that it's not just the person

1190
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:53,440
 who's found the application to the thing,

1191
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:54,880
 it's the person who identified it.

1192
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:58,320
 It's like giving a goal score in football,

1193
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:00,600
 not only to the person who's kicked or headed the ball in,

1194
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:02,120
 but to the assist.

1195
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:04,520
 And then even to someone who passed it to the assist.

1196
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:06,800
 - The whole team gets that goal.

1197
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:08,320
 It actually, football does work like that,

1198
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:11,560
 because goals are not given to individual players.

1199
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:13,240
 You're schooling me on football.

1200
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:15,560
 - But increasingly, you do find out

1201
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:17,160
 who the assist was for every goal.

1202
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:18,000
 - Yeah.

1203
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,200
 - And when you do, yeah.

1204
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:20,040
 - Yeah, you always do.

1205
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:21,760
 - And when they talk about, let's say,

1206
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:23,960
 Mbappe's done whatever he's done this season,

1207
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:26,040
 they'll say he's got this many goals and this many assists,

1208
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:27,440
 and they will mention it each time.

1209
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:28,280
 - Oh, I see.

1210
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:30,320
 - And I think it kind of began from fancy football,

1211
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:33,120
 because you get points for how many goals your player scored,

1212
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:34,080
 but they wanted to give points

1213
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:35,880
 to the people who were creating the goals,

1214
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:36,720
 and they get to them as well.

1215
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:37,680
 - Really? - Wow.

1216
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:40,040
 - Well, I've forgotten that it wasn't always like that.

1217
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:41,160
 - Definitely not, yeah.

1218
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:44,080
 - The Nobel Prize for Medicine this year,

1219
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:45,440
 or last year in 2023,

1220
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:49,040
 was given to Kathleen Caracol and Drew Weisman

1221
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:53,320
 for some mRNA vaccine stuff for COVID,

1222
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:57,520
 but they had the initial manuscript rejected by nature

1223
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:59,200
 and by science. - Really?

1224
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:00,040
 - No way.

1225
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:01,360
 - And they were rejected by nature.

1226
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:03,440
 - Do you mean by the journals, "Nature and Science"?

1227
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:05,200
 - Yes. (laughing)

1228
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:07,320
 - Also, "God and Man" were rejected.

1229
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:08,480
 (laughing)

1230
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:09,320
 Your work.

1231
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:15,120
 - Yeah, so "Nature" the journal rejected it within 24 hours.

1232
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:15,960
 - Oh.

1233
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:18,520
 - And so they didn't even send it to any reviewers or whatever.

1234
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:20,040
 They just got the letter through the post

1235
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:21,040
 and went, "This is shit."

1236
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:22,120
 - Really? - And just threw it away.

1237
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:22,960
 - Wow.

1238
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:23,800
 - What did you say it was for?

1239
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:24,960
 It was for mRNA?

1240
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:28,880
 - It was for developing more effective mRNA vaccines

1241
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:30,320
 against COVID-19.

1242
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:32,040
 - I just, I really worry about sort of Trump

1243
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:32,880
 listening to this and going,

1244
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:35,800
 "See, I told you, nature and science agree with me."

1245
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:37,920
 - But what it was is that they didn't think

1246
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:40,160
 that it was a big enough advancement.

1247
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:43,560
 They thought they were just kind of repeating old things

1248
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:44,680
 that people had already said,

1249
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:46,480
 but actually later on they realized

1250
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:48,880
 that it was actually a big, big advancement.

1251
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:53,080
 The 2023 Nobel Prize for Physics,

1252
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:55,200
 which was won by Pierre Agostini,

1253
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:57,760
 Ferench Kraus and Anne Wheelier,

1254
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:00,680
 is a way of measuring things

1255
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:03,480
 with atto-second pulses of light.

1256
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:06,880
 An atto-second is even shorter than a nanosecond.

1257
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:09,960
 It's extremely, extremely short amount of time.

1258
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:13,400
 In fact, it's one quintillionth of a second.

1259
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:14,920
 And if you wanted to have a quick meeting

1260
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:16,920
 with every insect on earth,

1261
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:20,040
 but had to complete all the meetings in one second,

1262
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:23,120
 then each insect would get an atto-second of your time.

1263
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:23,960
 - Oh.

1264
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:26,240
 Food for thought.

1265
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:28,680
 - And they managed to make these pulses of light,

1266
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:31,160
 each one an atto-second in length.

1267
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:34,560
 And that means that if you think about a movie

1268
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:37,120
 has however many frames per second,

1269
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:39,720
 if you can make one every atto-second,

1270
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:41,160
 then suddenly you can see things

1271
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:43,120
 that are happening almost instantaneously.

1272
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:45,120
 - I just find that when I'm watching films,

1273
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:46,520
 and I don't mean to denigrate these people,

1274
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:48,280
 but I find the colors fine

1275
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:50,760
 and the speed at which I see things happening is fine.

1276
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:52,440
 - You're still confused about the plot 10 minutes in.

1277
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:54,280
 It doesn't matter.

1278
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:55,120
 - I'm sorry.

1279
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:57,120
 I should say that these atto-second stuff

1280
00:41:57,120 --> 00:41:58,880
 will not be used to--

1281
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:01,680
 - To fill the next born identity, right, okay.

1282
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:04,680
 - It means that you can see like photosynthesis

1283
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:06,240
 happening in real time.

1284
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:07,800
 - Hang on, are you saying it also won't be used

1285
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:09,600
 to give lots of insects performance reviews?

1286
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:10,440
 (laughing)

1287
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:11,280
 - None of that.

1288
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:12,200
 - What is the point then?

1289
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:14,640
 I don't need to see photosynthesis happening in real time.

1290
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:15,800
 I'm sure it's really useful.

1291
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:18,200
 - Well, Anne-Louis Lié said that basic research

1292
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:19,840
 is very important because you never know

1293
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:22,800
 what applications will be found in 50 years' time.

1294
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:23,840
 We don't know what they'll be,

1295
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:26,000
 but something, this kind of technology

1296
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,320
 will change our lives, but we don't know how yet.

1297
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:30,480
 - We'll be kicking ourselves when the ninth born film

1298
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:31,960
 is filmed using this method,

1299
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:34,480
 and you can see him punch the guy as it happens,

1300
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:37,480
 rather than slightly after it happens.

1301
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:41,360
 - But can we address the heated debate on nano?

1302
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:42,920
 - Oh yeah, I'm sure. - Oh, great.

1303
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:44,920
 - Yeah, so this is nano technology.

1304
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:47,400
 This was also written in the birth of nano technology.

1305
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:49,200
 How do you spell it?

1306
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:51,440
 - N-A-N-O, no, no.

1307
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:55,120
 - Sometimes yes, and sometimes no.

1308
00:42:55,120 --> 00:42:57,880
 - Oh my God, I got really into this etymology.

1309
00:42:57,880 --> 00:42:59,600
 - Sometimes no, and sometimes nah.

1310
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:01,200
 (laughing)

1311
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:04,520
 - So it first appeared in biology as nano with a double N,

1312
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:06,520
 1909, this is niche stuff.

1313
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:08,440
 - I've never seen it spelled with double N.

1314
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:10,160
 - N-A-N-N-O. - Yes.

1315
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:12,560
 - Or N-N-A-N-O, no, no.

1316
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:13,520
 (laughing)

1317
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:14,920
 - I think you know the answer to that question.

1318
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:16,120
 - All right.

1319
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:17,440
 - So the reason you haven't seen it

1320
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:18,800
 is 'cause it was used in zoology,

1321
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:22,200
 and it was in biology, it is used with a double N.

1322
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:24,600
 It's much rarer in biology, and it just meant very small,

1323
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:28,160
 and it's 'cause nano in Greek meant dwarf.

1324
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:30,680
 So nano bacteria, nano plankton,

1325
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:33,440
 that it just became a tiny thing to mean tiny.

1326
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:36,280
 Then physics took it on, but there's a rule in physics,

1327
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:38,720
 which I didn't know about, which is very niche,

1328
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:41,680
 but very exciting, which is that

1329
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:44,480
 if something is a multiple of something,

1330
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:46,040
 so let's say you've got a meter,

1331
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:48,920
 if you're saying a thousand meters, what's that?

1332
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:50,560
 - Kilometer. - A kilometer.

1333
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:53,400
 And that, you use the Greek, so kilometer,

1334
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:54,720
 kilo is from Greek. - Okay.

1335
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:57,040
 - If it's a submultiple, a factor,

1336
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:59,880
 like a thousandth of a meter, what do we say?

1337
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:00,840
 - Millie.

1338
00:44:00,840 --> 00:44:02,280
 - Because if it's a submultiple,

1339
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:04,640
 exactly we use the Latin. - What?

1340
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:07,880
 - So they shouldn't have used the double N in nano

1341
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:10,600
 because that was the Greek. - Oh my God.

1342
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:14,880
 - Whereas the Latin for dwarf uses a single N, nanos,

1343
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:19,000
 and so the physicists who were adhering to convention

1344
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,120
 changed it to a single N.

1345
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:24,040
 Aren't you delighted? - There is no other podcast

1346
00:44:24,040 --> 00:44:25,960
 is blowing shit wide open like this.

1347
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:27,840
 - Anna, I'm so sorry, I actually heard that fact

1348
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:29,400
 on Shagged Married Anoid last week.

1349
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:32,720
 (all laughing)

1350
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:34,240
 But it was Shagged Married Anoid

1351
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:36,480
 with only one N, because...

1352
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:39,480
 - That'll be my spin-off.

1353
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:41,720
 - Shagged Married Anoid, the batteries podcast.

1354
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:43,480
 - Yeah. - Beautiful, that's your spin-off.

1355
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:45,320
 - There we go. - Shagged Married Anoid,

1356
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:47,400
 which is mine about my sinus problems.

1357
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:49,640
 (all laughing)

1358
00:44:49,640 --> 00:44:52,160
 - Shagged Married Anoid, for Dan.

1359
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:54,360
 - Oh no, that's mean.

1360
00:44:54,360 --> 00:44:57,240
 - You're lucky, I don't know what that word means.

1361
00:44:57,240 --> 00:44:59,360
 It's another word for wife guy.

1362
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:01,440
 - That's it, okay.

1363
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:04,400
 - Shagged Married, really happy, love my wife.

1364
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:07,080
 (all laughing)

1365
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:08,840
 - Make love, marriage.

1366
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:12,280
 (all laughing)

1367
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:14,240
 - Marry, then make love.

1368
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:16,600
 (all laughing)

1369
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:19,180
 (upbeat music)

1370
00:45:19,180 --> 00:45:25,000
 - Okay, it is time for a final fact of the show,

1371
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:26,240
 and that is my fact.

1372
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:28,200
 My fact this week is that right

1373
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:30,480
 at the southernmost point of Sweden,

1374
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:34,440
 you will find a statue of Umar Thurman's naked granny.

1375
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:38,200
 - I'm gonna say, as a guess,

1376
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:41,280
 that it will not be her when she was a granny.

1377
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:44,040
 It might have been her in earlier life.

1378
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:48,040
 - Yeah, you would say that in the correct way, yes.

1379
00:45:48,040 --> 00:45:48,880
 (all laughing)

1380
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:49,720
 - I'm like that.

1381
00:45:49,720 --> 00:45:52,240
 (all laughing)

1382
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:53,520
 - Yeah, she was a model.

1383
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:56,640
 Her grandmother was a model called Birgit Holmquist,

1384
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:59,640
 and the sculptor, who wanted to make the statue,

1385
00:45:59,640 --> 00:46:00,880
 hired her as a model,

1386
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:04,640
 and it's positioned right on this little seaside port

1387
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:08,280
 in this town, which is called Smigahuk, outside of--

1388
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:09,120
 - Trellarborgs.

1389
00:46:09,120 --> 00:46:10,520
 - Outside of Trellarborgs.

1390
00:46:10,520 --> 00:46:11,360
 - Yeah.

1391
00:46:11,360 --> 00:46:12,680
 - Is it more, is basically,

1392
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:15,200
 if you go past the new granny statue,

1393
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:16,160
 you are leaving Sweden.

1394
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:17,480
 - No, I don't, I'm not sure it's--

1395
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:18,960
 - It's a nice statue.

1396
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:20,560
 - It's a beautiful statue, you know.

1397
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:21,680
 - Is it full naked?

1398
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:22,520
 - She has, yeah.

1399
00:46:22,520 --> 00:46:23,680
 - No fig leaf or anything?

1400
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:24,520
 - Nope.

1401
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:25,360
 - Good on it.

1402
00:46:25,360 --> 00:46:26,200
 - No, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1403
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:27,440
 - Okay, wow.

1404
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:29,360
 Do we know anything else about this woman?

1405
00:46:29,360 --> 00:46:31,760
 Did the statues all over the world of her,

1406
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:33,960
 or was she just that and then gone?

1407
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:36,120
 - No, I mean, you know, she was a model,

1408
00:46:36,120 --> 00:46:38,080
 but really the Thurman family,

1409
00:46:38,080 --> 00:46:39,760
 like they're all such fascinating people.

1410
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:41,480
 - I reckon it started with these guys.

1411
00:46:41,480 --> 00:46:42,320
 - Yeah.

1412
00:46:42,320 --> 00:46:44,680
 - So she was a great Swedish beauty,

1413
00:46:44,680 --> 00:46:47,040
 but not from like an extremely rich family

1414
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:48,280
 or anything like that.

1415
00:46:48,280 --> 00:46:51,640
 But she married a Westphalian baron

1416
00:46:51,640 --> 00:46:54,200
 called Karl von Schläbrugge.

1417
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:55,040
 - Lovely.

1418
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:58,000
 - And Karl von Schläbrugge had a monocle.

1419
00:46:58,000 --> 00:46:58,840
 He was a baron.

1420
00:46:58,840 --> 00:46:59,680
 - Of course he did.

1421
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:02,080
 - He was briefly jailed by the Nazis

1422
00:47:02,080 --> 00:47:04,920
 for refusing to denounce his business partners

1423
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:09,080
 who were Jewish and Bridget used her Swedish nationality

1424
00:47:09,080 --> 00:47:11,280
 to kind of say, oh, look, he's Swedish as well.

1425
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:12,120
 He needs to come out.

1426
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:12,960
 He needs to come out.

1427
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:14,560
 And they managed to get him out of prison.

1428
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:16,320
 And then they moved off to,

1429
00:47:16,320 --> 00:47:18,160
 I think they went to Mexico or China

1430
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:19,680
 or something like that away from the war.

1431
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:20,520
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1432
00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:23,840
 - And yeah, that was basically the start of the dynasty.

1433
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:25,920
 - Basically they fled Nazi Germany

1434
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:28,560
 at what is now clearly the most socially acceptable time

1435
00:47:28,560 --> 00:47:30,640
 and we've done that which is in the 1930s

1436
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:33,360
 rather than in 1945 halfway through.

1437
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:35,560
 I moved to Central South America at the, yeah, yeah.

1438
00:47:35,560 --> 00:47:37,240
 - You've got to specify, don't you?

1439
00:47:37,240 --> 00:47:39,120
 Oh, I moved to South America from Nazi Germany.

1440
00:47:39,120 --> 00:47:39,960
 When?

1441
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:41,720
 (laughing)

1442
00:47:41,720 --> 00:47:43,680
 - Because actually there was another German

1443
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:45,320
 living in Mexico at the same time

1444
00:47:45,320 --> 00:47:48,760
 with a very, very similar name who was a Nazi spy.

1445
00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:51,800
 And some people on the internet think it's the same person.

1446
00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:53,440
 I'm pretty sure it isn't the same person.

1447
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:54,720
 - Von Schläbrugge's.

1448
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:56,800
 - I'm also pretty sure that Mexico isn't South America,

1449
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:58,760
 by the way, in case someone complains about it.

1450
00:47:58,760 --> 00:47:59,840
 - Is Central America?

1451
00:47:59,840 --> 00:48:01,120
 - No, it's North America.

1452
00:48:01,120 --> 00:48:01,960
 - What?

1453
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:04,000
 (laughing)

1454
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,200
 Then what's Canada?

1455
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:07,960
 (laughing)

1456
00:48:07,960 --> 00:48:09,880
 Sorry, great point, great point, great point, great point.

1457
00:48:09,880 --> 00:48:11,120
 Sorry, sorry to all that.

1458
00:48:11,120 --> 00:48:12,200
 Do we have listeners in Mexico?

1459
00:48:12,200 --> 00:48:13,920
 I don't know, I don't think I've ever had an email

1460
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:14,760
 from anyone in Mexico.

1461
00:48:14,760 --> 00:48:15,840
 - Okay, if you're in Mexico.

1462
00:48:15,840 --> 00:48:16,680
 - Yeah, right in, absolutely.

1463
00:48:16,680 --> 00:48:17,520
 - Right in, please.

1464
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:19,360
 - So, okay, that's the Schläbrugge's.

1465
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:22,080
 And then Uma Thurman's mum, so their daughter,

1466
00:48:22,080 --> 00:48:24,640
 was Nina Von Schläbrugge.

1467
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:26,680
 And she was also a model

1468
00:48:26,680 --> 00:48:27,520
 'cause she was very good looking.

1469
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:28,880
 'Cause she had monocle jeans.

1470
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:30,240
 - Monocle jeans.

1471
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:34,400
 And she was a model in Manhattan.

1472
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:37,600
 And she modeled for Dali, Salvador Dali, I think.

1473
00:48:37,600 --> 00:48:39,520
 - Yeah, she was very old. - Yeah, she was wild, wasn't she?

1474
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:41,920
 She, as in the life that she led

1475
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:43,000
 and the names that come up,

1476
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,080
 so before she married her husband

1477
00:48:45,080 --> 00:48:48,040
 that would lead to Uma and her brothers,

1478
00:48:48,040 --> 00:48:50,320
 she was married very briefly to Timothy Leary,

1479
00:48:50,320 --> 00:48:53,320
 who she was introduced to by Salvador Dali.

1480
00:48:53,320 --> 00:48:55,280
 So Timothy Leary, for those who don't know him,

1481
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:58,720
 he led the big push for psychedelics and LSD

1482
00:48:58,720 --> 00:49:01,880
 and counterculture in America in the '60s.

1483
00:49:01,880 --> 00:49:03,120
 - Briefly was correct.

1484
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:03,960
 - Yeah.

1485
00:49:03,960 --> 00:49:04,800
 - They were married very briefly.

1486
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:06,360
 They separated during the honeymoon.

1487
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:07,200
 - No.

1488
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:11,160
 - Leary said, we had time travel

1489
00:49:11,160 --> 00:49:13,640
 through a few mythic incarnations,

1490
00:49:13,640 --> 00:49:16,680
 played out magical dramas in panoramic realms.

1491
00:49:16,680 --> 00:49:18,160
 Now we would have to rise

1492
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:22,200
 to that most complex human art, gentle separation.

1493
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:23,040
 - Right.

1494
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:24,400
 - Yeah, I'd leave him too, actually.

1495
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:26,600
 - So he's describing.

1496
00:49:26,600 --> 00:49:29,480
 And she met her then next husband, Uma's dad,

1497
00:49:29,480 --> 00:49:31,680
 while she was at a house trying to get Leary

1498
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:33,200
 to sign the divorce papers.

1499
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:34,720
 So he was there for other reasons,

1500
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:36,040
 trying to get Leary to do something.

1501
00:49:36,040 --> 00:49:38,200
 - Well, I read that Robert Thurman,

1502
00:49:38,200 --> 00:49:40,080
 who was Uma Thurman's dad, obviously,

1503
00:49:40,080 --> 00:49:42,040
 was only present at that house

1504
00:49:42,040 --> 00:49:44,680
 where Nina was trying to persuade him to sign the papers.

1505
00:49:44,680 --> 00:49:45,840
 He was there trying to stop Leary

1506
00:49:45,840 --> 00:49:47,720
 taking so many drugs.

1507
00:49:47,720 --> 00:49:49,400
 - How did that go?

1508
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:50,240
 - I don't know.

1509
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:51,080
 Not very well.

1510
00:49:51,080 --> 00:49:51,920
 - That's funny.

1511
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:53,240
 - Leary's the guy who coined the phrase,

1512
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:54,560
 "Soon in, turn on, drop out."

1513
00:49:54,560 --> 00:49:55,400
 - That's right.

1514
00:49:55,400 --> 00:49:57,720
 - So he's a big counter-culture guy.

1515
00:49:57,720 --> 00:50:00,320
 But then Robert Thurman is even more interesting

1516
00:50:00,320 --> 00:50:01,240
 than Timothy Leary.

1517
00:50:01,240 --> 00:50:05,360
 He's kind of an Indiana Jones style scholar of Buddhism.

1518
00:50:05,360 --> 00:50:07,240
 And he's very cool.

1519
00:50:07,240 --> 00:50:09,520
 - He seems to be one of the people who made Buddhism cool

1520
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:11,280
 in the 20th century, really.

1521
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:15,520
 Kind of one of the leading popularizers of it in the US.

1522
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:19,800
 So he seemed to have a revelation in 1961

1523
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:21,760
 when he was changing a flat tire.

1524
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:26,760
 And he said the tire iron flicked up into his eye.

1525
00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:29,800
 And he went into a coma for three days.

1526
00:50:29,800 --> 00:50:31,440
 So I must have flicked up quite hard.

1527
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:33,160
 He woke up and he'd lost an eye.

1528
00:50:33,160 --> 00:50:35,480
 But as he says, he lost one eye

1529
00:50:35,480 --> 00:50:38,520
 but gained a thousand more as he pushed it.

1530
00:50:38,520 --> 00:50:39,360
 - Oh, wow.

1531
00:50:39,360 --> 00:50:40,200
 - And that's when he gave up.

1532
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:41,640
 - That's a botched surgery, isn't it?

1533
00:50:41,640 --> 00:50:44,640
 (all laugh)

1534
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:45,480
 - Yeah.

1535
00:50:45,480 --> 00:50:48,000
 I think the surgeon was on LSD at the time.

1536
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,320
 - Dr. Leary, not you.

1537
00:50:50,320 --> 00:50:52,600
 (all laugh)

1538
00:50:52,600 --> 00:50:54,240
 - I don't know, he was one of a playboy

1539
00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:55,880
 and he gave up his old playboy lifestyle,

1540
00:50:55,880 --> 00:50:57,280
 hitchhiked to India and thought,

1541
00:50:57,280 --> 00:50:59,720
 "I really want to become a Buddhist monk."

1542
00:50:59,720 --> 00:51:00,880
 - That's kind of what the Buddha did though.

1543
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:03,040
 The Buddha was a sort of playboy prince, wasn't he?

1544
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:03,880
 - Yeah, that's right.

1545
00:51:03,880 --> 00:51:06,960
 - But Thurman supposedly became the first American

1546
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:09,240
 to become officially a Buddhist monk.

1547
00:51:09,240 --> 00:51:11,080
 Like to be recognized as one.

1548
00:51:11,080 --> 00:51:11,920
 - Yeah.

1549
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:13,000
 - Do you know how long he lasted?

1550
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:13,980
 - How long?

1551
00:51:13,980 --> 00:51:15,320
 - I think less than a year.

1552
00:51:15,320 --> 00:51:16,400
 - Oh, God.

1553
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:17,920
 - He met this lama.

1554
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:20,000
 So he flew back from India to America,

1555
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:21,080
 met this lama and was like,

1556
00:51:21,080 --> 00:51:22,560
 "I've been in India and I'm desperate

1557
00:51:22,560 --> 00:51:23,400
 "to become a Buddhist monk.

1558
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:24,680
 "I'm going to be amazing at it."

1559
00:51:24,680 --> 00:51:25,920
 The lama kept saying,

1560
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:27,040
 "I'm looking at your karma

1561
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:28,520
 "and you don't have monk in you.

1562
00:51:28,520 --> 00:51:30,720
 "I promise you've got great things destined."

1563
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:31,960
 - You haven't got lama karma?

1564
00:51:31,960 --> 00:51:35,040
 - Yeah, I haven't got lama karma, that's what he said.

1565
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:37,040
 But Robert kept on saying,

1566
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:38,080
 "No, I really want to do it."

1567
00:51:38,080 --> 00:51:41,160
 So eventually the lama took him to meet the Dalai lama,

1568
00:51:41,160 --> 00:51:43,080
 the big lama, as he's otherwise known.

1569
00:51:43,080 --> 00:51:43,920
 - Boss lama.

1570
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:45,760
 - Boss lama, yeah, boss level,

1571
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:47,240
 who did ordain him as a monk

1572
00:51:47,240 --> 00:51:49,720
 and literally within 18 months, he resigned.

1573
00:51:49,720 --> 00:51:50,760
 - Why, why?

1574
00:51:50,760 --> 00:51:53,600
 - The monk lifestyle he decided wasn't for him.

1575
00:51:53,600 --> 00:51:55,080
 - Yeah, he's still leading.

1576
00:51:55,080 --> 00:51:55,920
 He's still massive.

1577
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:56,760
 - He's still leading the movement.

1578
00:51:56,760 --> 00:51:57,680
 The Dalai Lama was very like,

1579
00:51:57,680 --> 00:51:59,280
 "Yeah, cool, good move, mate."

1580
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:00,440
 - The best mate, yes.

1581
00:52:00,440 --> 00:52:02,400
 He and the Dalai Lama are very close

1582
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:04,280
 and he's the president of Tibet House US,

1583
00:52:04,280 --> 00:52:06,960
 which is the main Tibetan organization in the USA.

1584
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:08,920
 So they've a bet with each other

1585
00:52:08,920 --> 00:52:12,320
 to see if they can both live until the year 2048.

1586
00:52:12,320 --> 00:52:14,280
 - Or it's getting closer.

1587
00:52:14,280 --> 00:52:16,760
 Do you know how old that would make them both?

1588
00:52:16,760 --> 00:52:17,760
 'Cause I think he's in--

1589
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:19,320
 - Robert Thurman is in his 80s.

1590
00:52:19,320 --> 00:52:22,880
 - One of them will be 107, I think, maybe Thurman.

1591
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:23,720
 - That was interesting.

1592
00:52:23,720 --> 00:52:24,560
 - Is it what happened?

1593
00:52:24,560 --> 00:52:27,160
 They said, "Are you gonna live until this date?"

1594
00:52:27,160 --> 00:52:28,000
 And he said, "Yeah."

1595
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:29,600
 And he said, "Want Tibet?"

1596
00:52:29,600 --> 00:52:30,760
 And he said, "Yes, I do."

1597
00:52:30,760 --> 00:52:32,560
 And then Xi Jinping said, "Well done."

1598
00:52:32,560 --> 00:52:35,720
 - That is too good.

1599
00:52:35,720 --> 00:52:37,240
 - Uma Thurman sounds like the least interesting

1600
00:52:37,240 --> 00:52:38,160
 member of her own family.

1601
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:39,880
 I'd presume she was a relatively interesting person,

1602
00:52:39,880 --> 00:52:41,920
 but all these antecedents are so interesting.

1603
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:43,160
 - Yeah, they're awesome.

1604
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:44,960
 So James, just on the topic of Uma Thurman,

1605
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:49,960
 you have been watching her entire output of movies, right?

1606
00:52:49,960 --> 00:52:52,320
 - I've started, yeah.

1607
00:52:52,320 --> 00:52:53,720
 But I only started two days ago,

1608
00:52:53,720 --> 00:52:55,520
 so I've watched "Kill Bill One" and "Kill Bill Two."

1609
00:52:55,520 --> 00:52:56,360
 - Right.

1610
00:52:56,360 --> 00:52:58,720
 - Has any of you seen "Even Cowgirls Get the Blues?"

1611
00:52:58,720 --> 00:52:59,560
 - No.

1612
00:52:59,560 --> 00:53:00,680
 - Oh, I think that's, I mean,

1613
00:53:00,680 --> 00:53:02,200
 it's based on an amazing book.

1614
00:53:02,200 --> 00:53:03,480
 - Have you read it?

1615
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:05,000
 - No, no, I have it at home.

1616
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:06,360
 - It's the kind of book you would have read, actually.

1617
00:53:06,360 --> 00:53:07,440
 - Yeah, "Tom Robbins."

1618
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:08,520
 - Yeah, very good, very good.

1619
00:53:08,520 --> 00:53:10,480
 No, it's probably in a very bad film.

1620
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:12,320
 But I just love the concept.

1621
00:53:12,320 --> 00:53:14,920
 It's just about a woman with unusually long thumbs.

1622
00:53:14,920 --> 00:53:18,320
 And so it's called "Even Cowgirls Get the Blues."

1623
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:19,760
 - But it's an Uma Thurman film, sorry.

1624
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:20,600
 - It's an Uma Thurman film.

1625
00:53:20,600 --> 00:53:23,200
 She plays this girl with very long thumbs.

1626
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:24,040
 - That's interesting.

1627
00:53:24,040 --> 00:53:26,120
 She doesn't have long thumbs in real life, I don't think.

1628
00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:28,600
 - So I think she might have had to wear prosthetic thumbs.

1629
00:53:28,600 --> 00:53:29,440
 No, she doesn't have...

1630
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:30,280
 - She has big feet, doesn't she?

1631
00:53:30,280 --> 00:53:31,120
 - She's got massive feet.

1632
00:53:31,120 --> 00:53:33,840
 - Yeah, that's why she's in all of...

1633
00:53:33,840 --> 00:53:34,680
 What's his name?

1634
00:53:34,680 --> 00:53:35,520
 Who does those films?

1635
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:36,360
 - Tarantino.

1636
00:53:36,360 --> 00:53:37,200
 - Tarantino.

1637
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:39,200
 Yeah, because he likes feet, doesn't he?

1638
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:40,040
 - Does he?

1639
00:53:40,040 --> 00:53:40,880
 - I think so.

1640
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:41,720
 - Because there's lots of shots of her feet

1641
00:53:41,720 --> 00:53:43,080
 in these two movies, I can say that.

1642
00:53:43,080 --> 00:53:45,840
 She has size 11 feet, and that's American.

1643
00:53:45,840 --> 00:53:47,160
 - What's that in old money?

1644
00:53:47,160 --> 00:53:50,120
 - 12, I don't know, 10.

1645
00:53:50,120 --> 00:53:51,440
 - Yeah, it's one either side.

1646
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:52,280
 - Yeah, it's one either side.

1647
00:53:52,280 --> 00:53:53,120
 - Well, that's big either way.

1648
00:53:53,120 --> 00:53:53,960
 - I don't know if it's that.

1649
00:53:53,960 --> 00:53:54,800
 - That's very big, I agree.

1650
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:55,620
 - Thank you.

1651
00:53:55,620 --> 00:53:56,760
 - She can't have size 12 feet.

1652
00:53:56,760 --> 00:53:57,640
 - No, it's gotta be 10.

1653
00:53:57,640 --> 00:53:59,160
 - But 10 would be very big.

1654
00:53:59,160 --> 00:54:00,760
 It's still a good fact.

1655
00:54:00,760 --> 00:54:02,280
 - You don't need to write it and tell us, by the way,

1656
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:03,920
 we will have been able to Google the conversions

1657
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:04,760
 after this one.

1658
00:54:04,760 --> 00:54:07,040
 - Oh no, do not write it, please don't waste your time.

1659
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:08,640
 - I don't wanna wake up to 15 emails

1660
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:10,960
 about all subject like Uma Thurman feet pics.

1661
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:13,240
 - I don't want that, if you're in Mexico,

1662
00:54:13,240 --> 00:54:15,520
 then tell us what size 10 is in your country.

1663
00:54:15,520 --> 00:54:16,840
 (laughing)

1664
00:54:16,840 --> 00:54:19,320
 - And also, which America are you really in?

1665
00:54:19,320 --> 00:54:21,200
 (laughing)

1666
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:23,720
 - Oh dear, do you wanna hear about

1667
00:54:23,720 --> 00:54:26,160
 another very attractive Swedish woman

1668
00:54:26,160 --> 00:54:27,560
 who was turned into a statue?

1669
00:54:27,560 --> 00:54:28,400
 - Okay, okay.

1670
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:29,480
 - Well, not turned into, the model for.

1671
00:54:29,480 --> 00:54:30,560
 - Can we guess?

1672
00:54:30,560 --> 00:54:31,400
 - Absolutely not.

1673
00:54:31,400 --> 00:54:32,320
 - Brigitte Bardot.

1674
00:54:32,320 --> 00:54:34,000
 - No, she's not a famous one.

1675
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:35,000
 - Ulrika Johnson.

1676
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,760
 - She's still quite famous, I'd say.

1677
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:38,600
 - Oh yeah.

1678
00:54:38,600 --> 00:54:39,440
 - Do you feel like you're not being listened to, Andy?

1679
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:40,720
 - No, no, no, no, no, no.

1680
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:43,080
 This is Pitt Karin Err's daughter, okay?

1681
00:54:43,080 --> 00:54:43,920
 - Oh.

1682
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:47,640
 - She was a Swedish young woman.

1683
00:54:47,640 --> 00:54:49,480
 She was incredibly beautiful.

1684
00:54:49,480 --> 00:54:50,880
 She's just, the whole story about her is just,

1685
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:52,360
 there was this, she was a milkmaid.

1686
00:54:52,360 --> 00:54:55,360
 And the whole story is basically, she was just so fit.

1687
00:54:55,360 --> 00:54:57,920
 So she went to Stockholm to work for a year.

1688
00:54:57,920 --> 00:54:59,960
 And basically, no one could believe

1689
00:54:59,960 --> 00:55:01,240
 how attractive this milkmaid was.

1690
00:55:01,240 --> 00:55:04,120
 - And the bar is high in Sweden as well, don't you get?

1691
00:55:04,120 --> 00:55:07,120
 That's not like being the most attractive person in (beep)

1692
00:55:07,120 --> 00:55:07,960
 - Wow.

1693
00:55:07,960 --> 00:55:11,120
 - So why would you name, leave that place out.

1694
00:55:11,120 --> 00:55:12,960
 Leave that place name out.

1695
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:15,640
 - That was, bleep it out, no one will ever know

1696
00:55:15,640 --> 00:55:17,120
 the place name that I have there.

1697
00:55:17,120 --> 00:55:18,480
 Sorry, she was the most attractive person in Stockholm.

1698
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:21,200
 - So she was just so fit, basically.

1699
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:23,320
 - We get it, we get it, she's hot.

1700
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:26,720
 - But the stories are like the Crown Prince visitor

1701
00:55:26,720 --> 00:55:28,880
 incognito to ask for some milk,

1702
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:30,880
 because he just wanted to look at this milkmaid.

1703
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:33,000
 And he forgot to bring a container.

1704
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,080
 So she gave him a sort of scolding.

1705
00:55:35,080 --> 00:55:36,760
 - With hot milk?

1706
00:55:36,760 --> 00:55:37,840
 - Not a scolding, sorry.

1707
00:55:37,840 --> 00:55:39,160
 - A scolding.

1708
00:55:39,160 --> 00:55:43,800
 - She created traffic jams, cause she was so beautiful.

1709
00:55:43,800 --> 00:55:46,080
 People was doing a go slow as they went past.

1710
00:55:46,080 --> 00:55:49,600
 - Or was that just James not moving with his horse and cart?

1711
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:50,440
 - Yeah.

1712
00:55:50,440 --> 00:55:52,400
 And there's a statue of her in Sweden now.

1713
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:54,640
 And I think part of the reason she was apparently so beautiful

1714
00:55:54,640 --> 00:55:57,000
 was that she hadn't had some more pox.

1715
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:58,640
 - Oh, okay.

1716
00:55:58,640 --> 00:56:00,120
 - So the bar was slightly lower.

1717
00:56:00,120 --> 00:56:02,440
 - Yes, she had had cow pox.

1718
00:56:02,440 --> 00:56:05,480
 And she was accused actually of having sold more

1719
00:56:05,480 --> 00:56:08,680
 than just milk, you know what I mean?

1720
00:56:08,680 --> 00:56:10,200
 But that was real trick, trick.

1721
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:11,960
 - Yeah, yeah.

1722
00:56:11,960 --> 00:56:13,080
 - Milkshake.

1723
00:56:13,080 --> 00:56:16,320
 - Actually, she hadn't been selling any,

1724
00:56:16,320 --> 00:56:17,160
 she hadn't been-

1725
00:56:17,160 --> 00:56:18,000
 - Any of her milkshake?

1726
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:19,440
 - Right, yeah, she'd been selling milk

1727
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:20,280
 and she was just accused.

1728
00:56:20,280 --> 00:56:22,240
 - Her milkshake brought the king to the yard.

1729
00:56:22,240 --> 00:56:23,240
 - Yeah.

1730
00:56:23,240 --> 00:56:25,680
 - And he's like, "Oh, do you have a spare bowl?"

1731
00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:27,680
 (laughing)

1732
00:56:27,680 --> 00:56:30,120
 - What's the most famous statue in Scandinavia?

1733
00:56:30,120 --> 00:56:32,480
 - Do you have the answer?

1734
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:33,320
 - Yeah.

1735
00:56:33,320 --> 00:56:35,040
 - The Copenhagen mermaid?

1736
00:56:35,040 --> 00:56:36,720
 - The little mermaid, yeah.

1737
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:39,560
 Probably an advert for Carlsberg.

1738
00:56:39,560 --> 00:56:40,400
 - Oh, no.

1739
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:41,520
 - Yeah.

1740
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:44,240
 It was commissioned by the founder of Carlsberg,

1741
00:56:44,240 --> 00:56:46,200
 Jacob Christian Carlsberg.

1742
00:56:46,200 --> 00:56:48,800
 And he basically said,

1743
00:56:48,800 --> 00:56:50,840
 "Well, you know, I've got the best beer in the country,

1744
00:56:50,840 --> 00:56:53,280
 so I'm gonna do this nice little statue

1745
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:54,800
 for everyone to see.

1746
00:56:54,800 --> 00:56:56,680
 And when they see it, they'll remember me

1747
00:56:56,680 --> 00:56:58,000
 and remember my beer."

1748
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,360
 - Oh dear, that's fucked up, isn't it?

1749
00:57:00,360 --> 00:57:03,040
 Because one of those adverts, which is very memorable,

1750
00:57:03,040 --> 00:57:05,160
 that you've got no idea what it was for.

1751
00:57:05,160 --> 00:57:06,000
 - Yeah, yeah.

1752
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,440
 It's probably the best mermaid statue in the world.

1753
00:57:08,440 --> 00:57:09,760
 - Nice. - Very good.

1754
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:12,920
 He hired a sculpture called Edvard Ericsson to create it.

1755
00:57:12,920 --> 00:57:15,320
 And he hired a ballerina called Ellen Price,

1756
00:57:15,320 --> 00:57:17,360
 who is very, very famous in Sweden

1757
00:57:17,360 --> 00:57:18,920
 at the time to model for it.

1758
00:57:18,920 --> 00:57:21,280
 But she was unwilling to get naked.

1759
00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:22,600
 And so the face is hers

1760
00:57:22,600 --> 00:57:25,400
 and the body is Mr. Ericsson's wife.

1761
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:26,240
 - Really?

1762
00:57:26,240 --> 00:57:28,040
 - Wow, what about the tail?

1763
00:57:28,040 --> 00:57:30,880
 (laughing)

1764
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:31,720
 - No, that's his wife.

1765
00:57:31,720 --> 00:57:32,560
 - That's his wife.

1766
00:57:32,560 --> 00:57:35,080
 (laughing)

1767
00:57:35,080 --> 00:57:37,280
 - I've just got one more celebrity grandparent fact.

1768
00:57:37,280 --> 00:57:38,120
 - Oh yeah.

1769
00:57:38,120 --> 00:57:41,880
 - Drew Barrymore's grandfather's corpse was stolen.

1770
00:57:41,880 --> 00:57:45,240
 So this is John Barrymore, who was a very famous actor.

1771
00:57:45,240 --> 00:57:48,080
 In the, he was the, John's 1922 hamlet,

1772
00:57:48,080 --> 00:57:50,560
 which you probably remember was the greatest hamlet

1773
00:57:50,560 --> 00:57:51,400
 maybe ever.

1774
00:57:51,400 --> 00:57:52,720
 - Yeah, that was a good one.

1775
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:55,240
 - It really was, he was a famous actor.

1776
00:57:55,240 --> 00:57:57,760
 He was ruined by alcoholism and died in 1942,

1777
00:57:57,760 --> 00:57:58,880
 relatively young.

1778
00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:00,520
 His mates were people like Errol Flynn.

1779
00:58:00,520 --> 00:58:02,140
 And Errol Flynn wrote in his memoir

1780
00:58:02,140 --> 00:58:04,800
 that after Barrymore died,

1781
00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:08,440
 their friend got his body, obtained his body

1782
00:58:08,440 --> 00:58:11,680
 and hid it for Errol Flynn to find to freak him out.

1783
00:58:11,680 --> 00:58:13,120
 So propped him up in a chair

1784
00:58:13,120 --> 00:58:15,160
 and then they spent the night playing poker with it.

1785
00:58:15,160 --> 00:58:17,160
 - Is that what we can the Bernys is based on?

1786
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:19,160
 - Do you know what, I think largely it is.

1787
00:58:19,160 --> 00:58:20,800
 Cause it was, it was not only Errol Flynn,

1788
00:58:20,800 --> 00:58:22,080
 it was David Nevin.

1789
00:58:22,080 --> 00:58:23,840
 And I want to say Orson Welles,

1790
00:58:23,840 --> 00:58:25,880
 someone in that territory of fame.

1791
00:58:25,880 --> 00:58:26,720
 - There was a group of them.

1792
00:58:26,720 --> 00:58:27,560
 - There was a group of them.

1793
00:58:27,560 --> 00:58:29,160
 - I think it is because I haven't really heard

1794
00:58:29,160 --> 00:58:32,360
 of any of those people and I've never seen Weekend at Bernys.

1795
00:58:32,360 --> 00:58:33,880
 I'm not really sure what happens in it,

1796
00:58:33,880 --> 00:58:36,000
 but I still kind of knew that fact.

1797
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,440
 - Wait, so it's Weekend at Bernys about them playing.

1798
00:58:38,440 --> 00:58:39,600
 - I think it's about a dead body.

1799
00:58:39,600 --> 00:58:40,680
 - Keeping a dead body.

1800
00:58:40,680 --> 00:58:44,720
 - Their body dies and they need to keep a holiday going.

1801
00:58:44,720 --> 00:58:47,720
 And so they string him up and they use his dead body.

1802
00:58:47,720 --> 00:58:48,560
 Yeah.

1803
00:58:48,560 --> 00:58:49,400
 - There we go.

1804
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:50,240
 That's sort of what they did,

1805
00:58:50,240 --> 00:58:52,320
 except just to have a fun gamer poker with him.

1806
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:53,160
 - Wow.

1807
00:58:53,160 --> 00:58:55,040
 - Confirmed by Drew Barrymore in 2020.

1808
00:58:55,040 --> 00:58:55,880
 - That's right.

1809
00:58:55,880 --> 00:58:56,720
 - Good Lord.

1810
00:58:56,720 --> 00:58:57,560
 - Yeah, that's pretty cool.

1811
00:58:57,560 --> 00:59:00,480
 - If I die, please don't do that.

1812
00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:01,960
 Don't do another podcast.

1813
00:59:01,960 --> 00:59:04,120
 - What do you want us to do with your dead body then?

1814
00:59:04,120 --> 00:59:05,960
 Shall we, we could prop it up and do something fun,

1815
00:59:05,960 --> 00:59:07,720
 prop it up and collect some moths with you.

1816
00:59:07,720 --> 00:59:08,560
 - Yeah, lovely.

1817
00:59:08,560 --> 00:59:09,400
 - Or the acid thing.

1818
00:59:09,400 --> 00:59:10,240
 Let's just burn you.

1819
00:59:10,240 --> 00:59:12,480
 (laughing)

1820
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:17,800
 - Wow, what a dark term this podcast took at the end.

1821
00:59:17,800 --> 00:59:20,240
 - It's time to go to our group therapy session now.

1822
00:59:20,240 --> 00:59:22,040
 And just shoot that over.

1823
00:59:22,040 --> 00:59:26,620
 (upbeat music)

1824
00:59:26,620 --> 00:59:29,200
 (upbeat music)

1825
00:59:29,200 --> 00:59:31,780
 - Okay, that's it.

1826
00:59:31,780 --> 00:59:32,980
 That is all of our facts.
