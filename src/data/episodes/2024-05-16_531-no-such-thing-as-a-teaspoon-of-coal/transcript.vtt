WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.920
 - Hi everyone, just before we start this show,

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:05.280
 we've got an incredibly exciting announcement to make.

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:08.040
 - It is so exciting, especially for people

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.880
 who like to watch live comedy podcast fact shows.

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:14.320
 - What a great description of our show, James.

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:16.760
 It's like you've been rehearsing that for years.

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:20.520
 Yes, we are going on tour to do our comedy live podcast fact

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.480
 show. We are going all over the UK and Ireland

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.080
 and we are then going to Australia.

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:29.080
 - And then we are going to New Zealand.

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:31.800
 - Indeed we are. When are we doing this?

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.200
 I hear you ask. Well, we are starting off going to Edinburgh

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.520
 to just perform the podcast in August.

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:39.920
 - Yes. And then we will go to Bristol, Dublin, Glasgow,

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:42.440
 Newcastle, Cardiff, London, Manchester.

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:45.440
 We'll play all those places in the UK and Ireland.

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:49.800
 And then we are going down under in November.

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.000
 - Is that your attempt at almost doing an Australian accent?

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
 - I pulled out of it at the last second.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.480
 - I think that was a wise choice.

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:56.960
 - Well, we're going to go to Adelaide Perth,

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:59.200
 Brisbane, Sydney, Melbourne, Auckland, Wellington

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:02.720
 and Christchurch. But Anna, how do people get tickets?

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:07.280
 - They can go to knowsuchthingsafish.com/fishtour

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:10.080
 where you'll find links to any venue that you want to attend.

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.680
 Or why not come to all of them?

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:14.600
 - Why not? Indeed, I'll be at all of them.

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:15.920
 - So will I.

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:17.280
 - So, dude, come along to the show.

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:18.600
 It's going to be so much fun.

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.760
 We can't wait to get back on tour.

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:22.880
 Come to those gigs. Come and say hi.

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:24.080
 We'll see you there.

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:25.640
 - Okay. On with the show.

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:27.640
 - On with the podcast.

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:45.600
 - Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish,

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.480
 a weekly podcast coming to you from the QI offices in Hoburn.

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:52.400
 My name is Dan Schreiber. I'm sitting here with James Harkin,

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:54.720
 Anna Tyshinski and Andrew Hunter Murray.

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.920
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:59.560
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days.

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:02.400
 And in a particular order, here we go.

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:05.520
 Starting with fact number one, that is Anna.

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.360
 - My fact this week is that in 1974,

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:13.680
 thousands of swallows migrated over the Alps by train and plane.

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.200
 - Wow. - But not automobile.

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.000
 - This is amazing. Yes, it was 1974.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.280
 And there was bad weather all over the Alps.

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:24.920
 And this meant that insects were quite hard to find.

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:26.440
 They were dying and not being born.

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:29.400
 And the swallows were getting really hungry and cold.

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.800
 And this meant that they couldn't fly very well.

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:35.800
 And bizarrely, it was the police in Zurich,

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:39.200
 who for some reason drew attention to this.

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.360
 - This is a crime against nature.

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:42.840
 - Well, exactly. Yeah.

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:46.320
 Not too much crime in Zurich at the time, I guess.

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:47.640
 And so they said...

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:48.880
 (laughing)

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:51.760
 - Quickly qualify that because it's a hot place these days.

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:52.600
 - Yeah.

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:55.640
 And so they said these swallows are having a bad time.

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:59.320
 And this thing was organized to fly them over the Alps

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:02.160
 or take them by train and Swiss Air flew 10,000 of them.

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:03.400
 - Oh, how interesting.

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:04.800
 You see, when you said the fact,

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:07.440
 I thought it was like just a normal swallow

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:10.120
 was flying along and then jumped on a train.

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:12.440
 You know, like sometimes animals jump on trains.

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:13.800
 - Like pigeons. Yeah.

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:14.640
 - Oh, don't open this.

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:16.880
 - I know this was, I can't believe you've gone there.

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:18.000
 - Or on planes or something,

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.320
 but you're saying actual flights were put on.

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:21.160
 - Yes, sorry.

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.080
 - You can see, 'cause swallows, I guess, fly in formation.

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.960
 So if one goes on a train,

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:25.600
 I guess they'd all follow onto the train.

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:27.440
 And that would just be a terrifying train journey

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:28.840
 for a lot of passengers.

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:30.200
 But no, flights were put on.

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:31.560
 Swiss Air put on lots of flights.

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:33.640
 And then lots more thousands, in fact,

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:35.600
 were taken under the Alps or through a tunnel through the Alps.

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:38.040
 - Where do they go to swallows?

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:40.320
 - They were going to the Mediterranean

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:41.960
 to get a bit warmer.

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:44.880
 So they were flown to Nice, Marseille, Barcelona.

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:46.000
 They got the train.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.000
 And yeah.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:47.840
 - It's very nice.

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:49.400
 It's a very heartwarming story.

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:50.440
 It's a lovely tale.

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:52.600
 And I learned it from a heartwarming place,

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:55.200
 which is a book that my mum got me years ago

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:57.240
 called The Little Book of the Dawn Chorus.

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:59.840
 It's made of cardboard, and it's about 10 pages long.

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:02.040
 And each page is a big picture of a bird.

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:04.120
 And then you press a button next to that picture,

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:05.880
 and it makes the noise of that bird.

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:07.880
 - Isn't it a children's book?

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:09.720
 Doesn't sound like a grown-up's book.

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:13.040
 - I think children probably enjoy it for the most part.

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:15.120
 - Are you getting all of your facts these days

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:16.480
 from bedtime reading to your kid?

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:17.800
 You had "Goodnight, Moon."

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:19.680
 - You had "Sweet Packets."

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:20.520
 - "Goodnight, Moon."

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:21.760
 - Oh, yours was "Goodnight, Moon."

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:22.600
 Sorry.

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:23.680
 - God, what was my "Sweet Packets" like?

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:26.960
 - You said you found a fact on the side of a sweetie

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:27.800
 that you were--

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:28.640
 - Oh, my God.

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:30.120
 - Your research has gone downhill a lot.

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:31.520
 - It's a bit ropey, isn't it, actually?

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:32.360
 Yeah.

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:36.040
 - You do get birds going by ship all around the world.

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:36.880
 - Okay.

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:39.280
 - And that is more in what I thought the fact was.

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:41.240
 In the flying along, they get a bit tired,

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:42.640
 and they just sit on a ship for a while.

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:43.480
 - No.

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:44.560
 - And then they go on the ship for a bit,

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:45.680
 and then they fly off again.

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:46.520
 - That's clever.

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:49.120
 - And we found out this because they put tracking signals

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:52.000
 on birds, and they went,

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.760
 "Well, this one started going really slowly,

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:57.040
 "and exactly in the same direction as that tanker

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:58.720
 "that we know goes in this direction."

00:04:58.720 --> 00:04:59.640
 - So funny.

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:01.880
 - And so, yeah, apparently it is quite common.

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:03.880
 If you get injured a little bit,

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:06.640
 or if you're flying along and you get to a bit of turbulence

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:08.240
 that you can't really fly through very well,

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:10.960
 you might just drop down, go on a boat for a few days.

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:11.800
 - That's so good.

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:12.640
 - Nice.

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:13.480
 - Fly off again.

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:16.040
 - I saw a video the other day of it was either a hawker

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:19.040
 or an eagle is giant, and there's a guy who's gliding,

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:22.160
 and then it just perches on his frame

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:24.280
 and just kind of like chills out for a second

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:26.080
 to get a break and then goes off again.

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:28.040
 It's the most insane footage.

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:28.880
 - Do you think the hawk knows

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:30.480
 that it's like a glider or whatever?

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:31.320
 - I don't know.

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:33.040
 - Or do you think it thinks it's a really big bird?

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:33.880
 - Yeah.

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:37.160
 - In which case, do hawks also land on really big birds?

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:39.280
 - That was gonna be my next question.

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:43.640
 Do they have resting stations on like, yeah, a flock of birds?

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:45.120
 - And there's a blue tit on the hawk,

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:46.560
 and then a butterfly on the blue tit.

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:47.880
 - I guess you do that kind of

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:49.760
 when you're flying in formation, right?

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:51.760
 Because you're directly behind someone

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:53.480
 and you're kind of hitching the lift

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:54.920
 a little bit on the guy in front.

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:56.040
 - A bit, but if you did climb

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:57.160
 onto the back of the guy in front,

00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:58.400
 I think you'd be a noise.

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:00.840
 - There is a theory that would work,

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:05.840
 which is if you had flights, let's say from London to Zurich,

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:09.000
 there were 10 flights every day, whatever.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.200
 If you were to get them all to go at the same time,

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:14.040
 then you could have them flying behind each other,

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:17.120
 like geese or like swallows or whatever,

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:19.680
 and that would save us loads and loads of fuel.

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:21.280
 - That's so cool.

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:22.600
 - Oh, we're using the tailwind.

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:25.280
 - Yeah, you basically, well, there's no turbulence,

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:26.120
 it's like a slipstream.

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:27.680
 - Yeah, sorry, slipstream is what I mean.

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:29.480
 We're using the literally less air in the way.

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:32.280
 - Yeah, and the only reason we don't do that

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:34.880
 is because people like Dan are scared of flying.

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:36.320
 - Yeah, I'm not on for it.

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:39.320
 If the one in front breaks hard, then I'm going back a bit.

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:42.040
 - If you put those air brakes on, that's okay.

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:43.600
 - But what if you just, what if we were,

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:45.680
 we arranged that all the sort of nervous people

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:47.600
 get to go in the front plane, so they're fine.

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:49.560
 - Oh, what if one of them, they're first?

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:52.400
 - Oh, yeah, yeah, no, all right.

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:53.840
 - Well, the sleezers go at the back.

00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:55.160
 - See, this is why it's not happening.

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:57.000
 This is why, because people can't get along.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:58.840
 - But apparently we have the technology.

00:06:58.840 --> 00:06:59.800
 - That's a great idea. - That's a great idea.

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:00.640
 - It's a really good idea.

00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:02.480
 - You don't have to leave at the same time.

00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:04.240
 - Yeah, that's a problem. - I think convenient,

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:05.800
 sometimes you want to leave at different times.

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:06.640
 - I think it's great.

00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:08.320
 I think I might have mentioned this before.

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:10.360
 I would like it if you know when you're in,

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:12.440
 if you're sitting in traffic in a car.

00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:14.360
 Right, technically, as soon as the light goes green,

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:15.560
 it should be fine for everyone

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:17.600
 to just jam on the accelerator to full, right?

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:19.200
 - Yes. - Because as everyone accelerates,

00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:20.880
 the gaps also accelerate to the same amount.

00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:23.280
 - Yeah, yeah, but what about me reading my phone at the front?

00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:25.000
 (all laughing)

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:26.680
 - That's what's called a New York second.

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:28.640
 A New York, a New York second is the time

00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:30.240
 between the lights going green

00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:32.640
 and someone directly behind you beeping you,

00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:34.720
 the second it goes green to get me to move.

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:38.360
 - Am I the only person who, when I'm sat second in line

00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:40.280
 and the other person hasn't noticed,

00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:42.040
 I don't beep and I'm just like,

00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:43.400
 you know what, I'm not gonna beep.

00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:46.240
 I'm gonna be a good citizen and I'm not gonna honk.

00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:48.240
 I'm gonna let them notice by themselves.

00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:49.560
 - How long does that last?

00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:51.040
 - Just for a friend. - Until it goes red again.

00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:52.200
 - Yeah, I don't think-- - I'll just let them do it.

00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:53.720
 - I think you might be the only person.

00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:55.560
 - Are you doing it if someone's behind you as well?

00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:56.400
 - Yeah. - Wow.

00:07:56.400 --> 00:07:57.240
 - No, I've never-- - Usually the person

00:07:57.240 --> 00:07:58.080
 behind me will beep.

00:07:58.080 --> 00:07:59.200
 - Exactly, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:01.160
 So what you're doing is you're saving yourself

00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:02.600
 the effort of a beep because you know

00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:03.680
 that the person behind you will probably

00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:04.520
 get around to it. - I'm just following

00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:05.560
 the highway code.

00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:10.880
 - You're not supposed to be-- - No, you're looking at your phone

00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:11.720
 at the traffic light.

00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:12.560
 (laughing)

00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:13.400
 - That's not what you're supposed to use your heart for.

00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:15.040
 Tell people that lights have changed.

00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:15.880
 - No, that's true.

00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:17.640
 It's only if there's an imminent threat to life,

00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:18.480
 isn't it, that you're meant to--

00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:21.000
 - Yeah, to let someone know where you are as well.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:21.840
 - Right, yeah, yeah.

00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:23.160
 - So you are letting them know where you are.

00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:26.880
 You're saying, "I'm here and I'm not happy about it."

00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:27.720
 Birds.

00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:29.440
 - I feel like ab migration.

00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:30.560
 - What's that? - Ab migration.

00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:31.800
 - Ab migration.

00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:33.720
 It's basically when you're a bird

00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:35.760
 and you're migrating from one place to another,

00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:37.920
 but you accidentally join the wrong flock

00:08:37.920 --> 00:08:40.360
 and you just follow them to wherever they're going

00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:43.000
 and you end up in complete with the wrong part of the world.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.600
 - Oh, so they don't realize there's not a halfway through.

00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:46.440
 - No, until they get there.

00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:47.280
 - Yeah, right.

00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:48.200
 - Oh, shit.

00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:49.480
 - There's no one I can track here.

00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:51.600
 (laughing)

00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:52.440
 Does that really happen?

00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:54.320
 - It does happen, yeah.

00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:56.560
 - I, this is a very old fact,

00:08:56.560 --> 00:08:58.040
 but I discovered it's not on our show.

00:08:58.040 --> 00:08:59.400
 So I'm just plopping it in our show

00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:00.240
 'cause it's something we all know.

00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:02.200
 But in France, if your pet snail gets a train,

00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:03.640
 it needs its own ticket.

00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:06.840
 It has to pay for a ticket and it costs seven euro.

00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:07.680
 - Seven euro.

00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:10.480
 - Seven euro, which is, a dog is 20.

00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:11.320
 So--

00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:12.160
 - Do you think that's cheap?

00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:13.200
 - Well, it depends where you're going to.

00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:15.440
 But if you're going all the way from, you know,

00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:19.680
 niece to breast, seven euros is an absolute steal.

00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:20.960
 - But not for a snail.

00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:23.000
 - Well, how long is it gonna take to walk?

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.960
 (laughing)

00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:26.800
 - I guess.

00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:28.680
 You're just so used to hearing about European trains

00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:31.360
 being so cheap and amazing and, you know.

00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:32.200
 Well, that's striking.

00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:33.600
 I mean, especially 'cause if you've got a few snails,

00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:34.720
 that'll rack up quite quickly.

00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:36.520
 Well, what I'm confused about is one person

00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:37.520
 is only allowed one animal.

00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:38.760
 So one animal per person.

00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:40.720
 So, right, I think you're only allowed

00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:42.480
 your favorite snail to come.

00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:44.360
 - You must be able to claim it's a wild snail.

00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:45.800
 If you just put the snail down next to you

00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:46.840
 and say, "It's nothing to do with me."

00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:47.680
 (laughing)

00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:49.880
 - Yeah, but then he gets kicked off for fair evasion

00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:51.600
 and then you've lost your favorite snail.

00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:52.880
 - He's like, "Anna, Anna!"

00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:53.960
 (laughing)

00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:55.560
 We've known each other for years!

00:09:55.560 --> 00:09:56.560
 (laughing)

00:09:56.560 --> 00:09:57.920
 - Honestly, it's a different Anna.

00:09:57.920 --> 00:10:00.200
 (laughing)

00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:02.360
 James, did you, sorry, I have to ask.

00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:05.400
 When you just used the example of going from niece to breast,

00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:06.240
 was it 'cause in your head,

00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:07.680
 you were saying the words, "Nice breast."

00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:08.840
 (laughing)

00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:10.440
 - Great question, great question.

00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:11.720
 - That's what I've assumed.

00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:12.920
 You've just got nice breast,

00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:14.840
 nice breast going through your head at all times,

00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:16.760
 and you thought, "I can use this."

00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:18.600
 - Genuinely, I thought of what is the most

00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:20.240
 southeasterly town and what is the most

00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:21.800
 north-westernly town I could think of.

00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:22.640
 And that was it.

00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:23.680
 - Okay. - That is good.

00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:24.800
 - Yeah, very strong.

00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:25.640
 - I have a link.

00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:26.480
 I have a link.

00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:27.320
 - Yeah.

00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:28.160
 - Patricia Highsmith, the writer.

00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:29.520
 - Oh, yeah. - Of the town of Mr. Ripley.

00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:31.040
 Didn't she keep pet snails?

00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:33.320
 - I think she would turn up places with them in a handbag,

00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:35.120
 and I think she would let them crawl around her.

00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:37.320
 - I think she hid some under her breasts

00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:39.240
 when she was going from one country to another,

00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:40.240
 so she didn't have to.

00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:41.080
 - Yeah, exactly. - Really?

00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:42.400
 - Oh, there you go. - Her nice breasts.

00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:43.320
 So there we go. - Yeah.

00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:44.400
 - We've come full circle.

00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:46.800
 - There we are. - And we have my train.

00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:48.640
 - Birds and trains.

00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:49.680
 - Yeah.

00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:51.840
 - So Japanese trains.

00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:53.000
 What's the first thing you think?

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:53.840
 - Fast.

00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:54.680
 - Shinkansen.

00:10:54.680 --> 00:10:55.520
 - Fast.

00:10:55.520 --> 00:10:56.920
 - Exactly, you've all said the right thing.

00:10:56.920 --> 00:10:57.760
 - Fast. - On time.

00:10:57.760 --> 00:10:58.600
 - Shinkansen, bullet train.

00:10:58.600 --> 00:10:59.800
 No, no, no, stop.

00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:00.640
 - I know more.

00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:02.880
 - Well, fair enough.

00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:04.240
 There was a problem with the bullet trains, right?

00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:05.480
 They were very, they were fast.

00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:06.840
 That was great.

00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:09.280
 But they were causing these sonic booms

00:11:09.280 --> 00:11:10.280
 when they came out of tunnels

00:11:10.280 --> 00:11:11.960
 'cause they pushed the air ahead

00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:13.120
 and like a cork out of a bottle,

00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:15.280
 the air just pops out really loud,

00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:16.560
 hundreds of meters away.

00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:17.640
 It was so loud.

00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:21.440
 It was like miserable to live anywhere near these trains.

00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:24.120
 And they were on overhead wires as well.

00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:26.840
 And then the chief engineer who was called A.G. Nakatsu,

00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:29.600
 he was interested in owls and how owls move quietly

00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:31.400
 'cause owls have these little structures

00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:33.760
 on their feathers called fimbrii.

00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:35.440
 - They make like vortices and stuff.

00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:37.160
 - Exactly, they break down the air

00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:39.680
 into sort of micro-turbulances.

00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:42.000
 And he said to his team, "This is the future."

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.920
 And every Japanese train has an owl strapped to the front.

00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:48.240
 That's right.

00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:49.720
 It's very cruel.

00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:51.960
 - And instead of a holland, they go, "Whoo-hoo!"

00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:55.920
 - So there are these wing grafts put on the trains

00:11:55.920 --> 00:11:57.880
 and then to deal with the train coming out of the tunnel

00:11:57.880 --> 00:12:01.240
 and having the sort of cork popping sonic boom effect,

00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:02.360
 he looked to kingfishers

00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:04.840
 'cause they dive into the water with no splash.

00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:07.080
 If you've ever seen a really slow image of a video

00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:09.720
 of kingfishers just dive again, no ripple.

00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:11.720
 So he changed the body shape of the front of the train

00:12:11.720 --> 00:12:14.200
 and they are quieter and they have less air resistance,

00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:16.640
 they use less energy, they cost less, they use less fuel.

00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:18.600
 - You know what birds also do, fly.

00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:20.560
 So he could have put wings on it.

00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:23.360
 (all laughing)

00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:25.800
 - Yeah, and it all came from that?

00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:26.640
 - Very cool.

00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:27.880
 - All the trains are based on birds.

00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:28.720
 - Basically birds.

00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:29.560
 - Oh, yeah.

00:12:29.560 --> 00:12:32.920
 - In China, they have a tunnel

00:12:32.920 --> 00:12:35.800
 that they're building at the moment for trains.

00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:38.560
 It's 12 meters across this tunnel,

00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:41.840
 but due to the movement of the Earth's crust,

00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:44.880
 it's shrinking and it's currently now

00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:47.000
 less than three meters across.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:47.840
 - What?

00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:49.720
 - Because the Earth's plates are squishing it together.

00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:50.560
 - Oh no.

00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:52.120
 - Isn't that amazing?

00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:53.240
 - That's incredible.

00:12:53.240 --> 00:12:55.080
 - Hang on, so this is a train tunnel

00:12:55.080 --> 00:12:56.440
 that was built 12 meters across.

00:12:56.440 --> 00:12:58.520
 - They're currently in the middle of building it.

00:12:58.520 --> 00:13:01.760
 It was supposed to be ready to go in like next year,

00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:04.000
 but they keep going back and it's smaller again.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:04.840
 - How can I be confusing?

00:13:04.840 --> 00:13:06.600
 Do you think you were unpunked or something?

00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:08.280
 You were like, what is going on?

00:13:08.280 --> 00:13:09.120
 This was massive.

00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:10.520
 - Are they gonna have to make the train

00:13:10.520 --> 00:13:14.240
 one of those very small novelty steam trains?

00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:15.840
 - Everybody off the big train.

00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:20.000
 Isn't that weird?

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:20.840
 - That's so good.

00:13:20.840 --> 00:13:22.640
 - And they put loads of concrete supports in,

00:13:22.640 --> 00:13:23.840
 they just got smashed.

00:13:23.840 --> 00:13:26.200
 - Yeah, 'cause these are tectonic plates.

00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:27.040
 - Are they moving that?

00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:29.200
 I didn't know bits of Earth were moving that fast.

00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:31.400
 - Well, let me introduce you to Earthquakes.

00:13:31.400 --> 00:13:32.240
 - Nice.

00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:33.080
 - It's nice to meet you.

00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:34.280
 (laughing)

00:13:34.280 --> 00:13:35.640
 - But this is, yeah, I mean,

00:13:35.640 --> 00:13:37.680
 there are some parts of the Earth that are moving.

00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:39.280
 I mean, this is not like moving.

00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:40.520
 You can't see it moving.

00:13:40.520 --> 00:13:41.760
 - And they're still sticking with it?

00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:43.080
 They're not just gonna get a new mountain.

00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:44.040
 - I think what they're gonna do at the moment

00:13:44.040 --> 00:13:44.960
 is they're just gonna wait

00:13:44.960 --> 00:13:47.040
 and hopefully it's gonna stop moving soon

00:13:47.040 --> 00:13:49.720
 and then they're gonna be able to build it.

00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:50.560
 - Wow.

00:13:50.560 --> 00:13:51.520
 - Just predict, nearby.

00:13:51.520 --> 00:13:52.720
 - Well, hang on, hang on, hang on.

00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:54.400
 - All they need to do is wait long enough

00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:56.880
 and then the movement will go so much

00:13:56.880 --> 00:13:57.880
 that the tunnel will--

00:13:57.880 --> 00:13:58.920
 - Start making itself.

00:13:58.920 --> 00:14:00.560
 - It will reverse, exactly.

00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:02.400
 And it'll start getting bigger again.

00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:03.800
 'Cause all the concrete will have gone through

00:14:03.800 --> 00:14:04.640
 to the other side.

00:14:04.640 --> 00:14:05.480
 Do you see what I mean?

00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:06.520
 - That makes no more sense

00:14:06.520 --> 00:14:08.040
 with the accompanying hand gestures

00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:10.520
 that we can see than it does to the listener.

00:14:10.520 --> 00:14:11.800
 - Okay, fine, fine.

00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:14.520
 - Do you know the Snowdon Mountain Railway?

00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:16.120
 So for the broad listeners,

00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:18.000
 there's Snowdonia is the highest mountain in Wales

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.080
 and has a train going up it,

00:14:20.080 --> 00:14:21.040
 which is kind of famous

00:14:21.040 --> 00:14:22.880
 'cause it's a way you can cheat to get to the top.

00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:24.960
 But did you guys know that it was built in the 1890s

00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:26.360
 and it's very first trip.

00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:27.680
 All the trains on it crashed

00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:29.400
 and out to close immediately for a year.

00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:30.240
 - Oh no, no.

00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:31.080
 - For a year.

00:14:31.080 --> 00:14:33.040
 - Yeah, 1896.

00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:34.200
 So there were two trains

00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:35.560
 that went on this inaugural journey.

00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:36.920
 They got off the top of Snowdon.

00:14:36.920 --> 00:14:39.560
 One was released to go down.

00:14:39.560 --> 00:14:40.480
 They completely lost control.

00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:42.120
 The engine of it derailed

00:14:42.120 --> 00:14:43.280
 and the driver and the guy

00:14:43.280 --> 00:14:45.240
 who was spooning coal into it or whatever,

00:14:45.240 --> 00:14:47.240
 both leapt off it.

00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:48.080
 - Shuffling?

00:14:48.080 --> 00:14:48.920
 - Shuffling.

00:14:48.920 --> 00:14:50.920
 - Spooning coal.

00:14:50.920 --> 00:14:53.000
 We can't get the power it's so in.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:54.120
 Use the dessert spoon.

00:14:54.120 --> 00:14:55.720
 Stop with the teaspoon.

00:14:55.720 --> 00:14:56.720
 - Oh, I thought differently.

00:14:56.720 --> 00:14:59.280
 I thought whether the conductor is in bed with coal.

00:14:59.280 --> 00:15:02.680
 Stop hugging that coal and get out here.

00:15:02.680 --> 00:15:06.000
 - Yeah, look, I don't work in the rail industry.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:06.840
 - Stoking.

00:15:06.840 --> 00:15:07.840
 - Stoking.

00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:09.720
 The stoker and the driver

00:15:09.720 --> 00:15:11.400
 both threw themselves off the engine

00:15:11.400 --> 00:15:13.000
 just as it flew over a cliff

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.400
 and hulled down onto the, you know, ground below.

00:15:15.400 --> 00:15:16.240
 - Wow.

00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:17.080
 - A few hundred meters.

00:15:17.080 --> 00:15:20.120
 And then the carriage is careering down on its own.

00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:20.960
 - Oh, my goodness.

00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:21.800
 - The rail.

00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:22.920
 So all these passengers are on the carriage.

00:15:22.920 --> 00:15:25.400
 - But ahead, there's a point.

00:15:25.400 --> 00:15:27.360
 And there are five people strapped to the track.

00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:30.120
 (laughing)

00:15:30.120 --> 00:15:31.840
 - There was actually, there was one,

00:15:31.840 --> 00:15:32.960
 there was a one death

00:15:32.960 --> 00:15:35.160
 because there was one guy on the carriage

00:15:35.160 --> 00:15:39.400
 who saw the driver and stoker leap off the engine.

00:15:39.400 --> 00:15:40.680
 So the guy in the carriage thought,

00:15:40.680 --> 00:15:42.040
 well, I better do that as well.

00:15:42.040 --> 00:15:43.600
 So he just threw himself out of the carriage

00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:45.120
 and sadly plummeted into his death.

00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:46.360
 - I know it's a use in the one who died, right?

00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:48.800
 - Whereas the rest of the carriages eventually slowed down.

00:15:48.800 --> 00:15:50.200
 - Once they entered a tunnel,

00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:52.960
 which gradually grew closer.

00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:54.000
 Riding them to a halt.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.580
 (upbeat music)

00:15:56.580 --> 00:16:01.680
 - Okay, it is time for fact number two.

00:16:01.680 --> 00:16:03.080
 And that is Andy.

00:16:03.080 --> 00:16:04.880
 My fact is that in 1827,

00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:06.440
 a shop opened in Cincinnati

00:16:06.440 --> 00:16:09.600
 where the principal currency was time itself.

00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:12.360
 (laughing)

00:16:12.360 --> 00:16:13.200
 - I'm just remembering,

00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:14.720
 we only let you do this fact, didn't we?

00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:16.200
 Because we knew you would do that.

00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:17.240
 - Yeah, we wanted to see. - We wanted to see.

00:16:17.240 --> 00:16:18.920
 - Yeah, and you did.

00:16:18.920 --> 00:16:19.920
 - It's a good fact as well.

00:16:19.920 --> 00:16:20.760
 - Thank you.

00:16:20.760 --> 00:16:22.800
 This is a place called the Cincinnati Time Store

00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:26.120
 and it was created by a guy called Josiah Warren,

00:16:26.120 --> 00:16:28.560
 who was a utopian and a socialist.

00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:31.160
 And he would now be described as an anarchist,

00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:33.160
 but I don't think the phrase really existed at the time.

00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:34.800
 Basically, his idea was,

00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:37.000
 I'm going to sell things for what they cost me.

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:39.320
 And the only thing I'm going to add to the price

00:16:39.320 --> 00:16:43.120
 is the value of the time I've spent on this stuff.

00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:45.360
 So he claimed basically labor

00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:47.800
 was the only true currency, if you like.

00:16:47.800 --> 00:16:50.080
 - So it's like the time of people coming into the shop

00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:51.120
 and deciding what to get,

00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:52.640
 the time of him wrapping it up,

00:16:52.640 --> 00:16:54.040
 the time of him weighing stuff,

00:16:54.040 --> 00:16:56.200
 the time of him bringing stuff from the back room

00:16:56.200 --> 00:16:57.720
 into the front light, all that kind of stuff.

00:16:57.720 --> 00:16:59.600
 - All of that, and it involves quite a lot of calculation.

00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:00.880
 And also, I love this,

00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:02.640
 the longer he spent with the customer,

00:17:02.640 --> 00:17:04.880
 the more it would cost the customer

00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:06.520
 because his time was worth money.

00:17:06.520 --> 00:17:08.560
 - So if I'm behind that customer

00:17:08.560 --> 00:17:10.320
 that's taking so much time,

00:17:10.320 --> 00:17:11.520
 (laughing)

00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:12.840
 do I have to pay less or?

00:17:12.840 --> 00:17:14.120
 - Yeah, they haven't noticed.

00:17:14.120 --> 00:17:17.600
 You're in your car, do you honk your horn?

00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:18.520
 Even though it's costing.

00:17:18.520 --> 00:17:20.080
 I think he had a timer dial

00:17:20.080 --> 00:17:22.760
 so that as he stayed in the shop for ages saying,

00:17:22.760 --> 00:17:25.120
 "Oh, I don't know if I want the big one or the small one."

00:17:25.120 --> 00:17:28.240
 - Yeah, it's sort of notch up because this is his time.

00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:29.880
 - It actually seems more aggressive

00:17:29.880 --> 00:17:32.560
 even though it's a utopian, cheapening thing.

00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:35.160
 - But he said that it went through so many customers

00:17:35.160 --> 00:17:36.480
 since such a quick amount of time

00:17:36.480 --> 00:17:38.440
 that he could shut the shop halfway through the day

00:17:38.440 --> 00:17:40.280
 because he'd done basically the full days

00:17:40.280 --> 00:17:42.080
 worth of money that he needed to earn.

00:17:42.080 --> 00:17:43.400
 - Yeah, which is pretty nuts.

00:17:43.400 --> 00:17:45.000
 You can't do that with a shop.

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:47.000
 What if I want to get to the shop at 3.30

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:48.320
 and they've just closed at mid-dig?

00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:50.040
 So they've gone, "We've had enough customers for the day."

00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:51.960
 - Well, go to like a square capitalist shop

00:17:51.960 --> 00:17:54.480
 and not to the utopian anarchist.

00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:55.320
 - That's fine.

00:17:55.320 --> 00:17:56.160
 He was also, and I don't think

00:17:56.160 --> 00:17:57.440
 this is how he'd like to be characterised,

00:17:57.440 --> 00:17:59.880
 but he was just like a modern day lawyer

00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:01.440
 in the sense of time, wasn't he?

00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:02.280
 - Yeah.

00:18:02.280 --> 00:18:03.320
 - 'Cause that's what you get with lawyers.

00:18:03.320 --> 00:18:04.320
 The more time he spent with them,

00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:05.160
 the more they charge.

00:18:05.160 --> 00:18:06.000
 You're having--

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:07.160
 - And sex workers.

00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:08.000
 (laughing)

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:08.840
 - And sex workers.

00:18:08.840 --> 00:18:09.760
 So you've got to rush through both, haven't you?

00:18:09.760 --> 00:18:10.600
 - I assume.

00:18:10.600 --> 00:18:12.120
 (laughing)

00:18:12.120 --> 00:18:14.280
 Never used a lawyer, so I'm not sure if that's the same.

00:18:14.280 --> 00:18:15.840
 (laughing)

00:18:15.840 --> 00:18:18.120
 For the first few days when he opened it,

00:18:18.120 --> 00:18:19.960
 he didn't have a single customer.

00:18:19.960 --> 00:18:20.800
 - Really?

00:18:20.800 --> 00:18:22.800
 - Yeah, and he asked his brother, George,

00:18:22.800 --> 00:18:25.480
 to come and make some purchases for his family.

00:18:25.480 --> 00:18:26.320
 - Clever.

00:18:26.320 --> 00:18:28.080
 - And then George came and told his friends

00:18:28.080 --> 00:18:30.320
 and then George's friends came.

00:18:30.320 --> 00:18:31.320
 And then in the first week,

00:18:31.320 --> 00:18:33.880
 he'd made $5 worth of sales.

00:18:33.880 --> 00:18:34.720
 - Is that a lot?

00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:36.760
 It was in the 18s, 20s, wasn't it?

00:18:36.760 --> 00:18:39.440
 - Even in those days, it wasn't enough to live off,

00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:42.240
 but it took off relatively quickly after that.

00:18:42.240 --> 00:18:45.040
 There was a guy who had another shop around McCona,

00:18:45.040 --> 00:18:46.440
 who kind of came in and said,

00:18:46.440 --> 00:18:48.160
 "You're putting me out of business, mate."

00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:49.000
 - Yeah.

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:49.840
 - Oh, really?

00:18:49.840 --> 00:18:51.960
 - And he said, "Well, maybe you could show me how to do it."

00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:53.560
 And Josiah Warren, so I said,

00:18:53.560 --> 00:18:55.080
 "Okay, well this is what I'm doing."

00:18:55.080 --> 00:18:56.960
 And the guy copied his system.

00:18:56.960 --> 00:18:59.240
 - I think the idea is that time also

00:18:59.240 --> 00:19:01.000
 has a slightly variable value.

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:04.080
 So nobody profits from anyone else's labor is the idea.

00:19:04.080 --> 00:19:06.640
 You don't get to just add a huge whack

00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:08.120
 to the amount of time you spend on something

00:19:08.120 --> 00:19:10.120
 because the time is the currency.

00:19:10.120 --> 00:19:12.280
 But also, if a job is harder or more disgusting,

00:19:12.280 --> 00:19:14.320
 I think it would be worth more time.

00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:16.760
 So for example, I love making the show.

00:19:16.760 --> 00:19:19.720
 So probably an hour and a half recording,

00:19:19.720 --> 00:19:21.640
 I will actually only get paid half an hour of time

00:19:21.640 --> 00:19:23.120
 because it's so much fun to do.

00:19:23.120 --> 00:19:25.200
 - We're responding to the emails that people send in.

00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:26.040
 How much would you--

00:19:26.040 --> 00:19:28.800
 - A quintuple, yeah, I'll make it back.

00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:30.880
 - That's why I get paid five times as much as you, isn't it, Andy?

00:19:30.880 --> 00:19:32.040
 I hate making this show.

00:19:32.040 --> 00:19:34.680
 So two hours recording, I actually get paid.

00:19:34.680 --> 00:19:36.280
 - Do you know why that was the case?

00:19:36.280 --> 00:19:39.040
 Because actually, this idea was not new.

00:19:39.040 --> 00:19:41.080
 But the reason that he had different amounts

00:19:41.080 --> 00:19:43.360
 of different people is because he'd previously been

00:19:43.360 --> 00:19:47.120
 in another utopia called New Harmony.

00:19:47.120 --> 00:19:48.800
 And at New Harmony, that had failed

00:19:48.800 --> 00:19:52.320
 because anyone who was good at like building houses

00:19:52.320 --> 00:19:54.840
 just decided, wait a minute, I'm getting paid the same

00:19:54.840 --> 00:19:57.120
 as the people who are doing something

00:19:57.120 --> 00:19:58.560
 which isn't skillful at all.

00:19:58.560 --> 00:20:00.800
 And actually, it all fell apart because of that.

00:20:00.800 --> 00:20:03.800
 And so he decided that his new utopias and new ideas

00:20:03.800 --> 00:20:05.080
 were gonna be slightly different

00:20:05.080 --> 00:20:06.480
 and have a slightly different thing

00:20:06.480 --> 00:20:09.160
 where different skills paid different amounts.

00:20:09.160 --> 00:20:11.200
 - So he took over this small little town

00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:12.920
 called Modern Times.

00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:14.040
 - The place is called Modern Times.

00:20:14.040 --> 00:20:16.040
 - It's called Modern Times, it's a name.

00:20:16.040 --> 00:20:18.520
 They had like 150 people who signed up

00:20:18.520 --> 00:20:20.320
 to the idea of living in this utopia.

00:20:20.320 --> 00:20:22.400
 - So that started off a bit dodgily

00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:26.320
 because he had this big group of people who were all utopians.

00:20:26.320 --> 00:20:28.840
 And then one of them began to advocate

00:20:28.840 --> 00:20:31.400
 for plurality of wives.

00:20:31.400 --> 00:20:34.960
 Another one believed that clothing was a superfluity.

00:20:34.960 --> 00:20:36.840
 So he didn't have to wear any clothes.

00:20:36.840 --> 00:20:38.520
 And there was another one who thought

00:20:38.520 --> 00:20:40.480
 that actually you shouldn't really eat properly,

00:20:40.480 --> 00:20:42.400
 you should just eat beans and nothing else.

00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:43.240
 - Oh no.

00:20:43.240 --> 00:20:45.600
 - And yeah, it was basically attracted all these people

00:20:45.600 --> 00:20:48.800
 who had all these different ideas outside of the mainstream.

00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:50.840
 And at the very start, it went really badly

00:20:50.840 --> 00:20:53.640
 and the newspapers were saying this is gonna be a disaster

00:20:53.640 --> 00:20:55.480
 but it did prosper in the end.

00:20:55.480 --> 00:20:56.320
 - Did it?

00:20:56.320 --> 00:20:59.480
 Even though it sounds like a load of farty naked sleazy men.

00:20:59.480 --> 00:21:02.560
 - They got rid of the farty ones and the sleazy ones.

00:21:02.560 --> 00:21:03.400
 - Okay.

00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:05.080
 - They got rid of the dwarfs.

00:21:05.080 --> 00:21:07.000
 (all laughing)

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:08.680
 And then in the end it did falter

00:21:08.680 --> 00:21:11.280
 but it was because there was a huge panic

00:21:11.280 --> 00:21:15.000
 in the mid-19th century and then the civil war

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:16.600
 and then that was where it fell apart.

00:21:16.600 --> 00:21:17.440
 - Yeah.

00:21:17.440 --> 00:21:20.840
 But it did according to their like press, you know,

00:21:20.840 --> 00:21:22.800
 it went for 13 years solidly.

00:21:22.800 --> 00:21:24.280
 They didn't have government, they didn't have law,

00:21:24.280 --> 00:21:28.800
 no police, but they didn't have any reported crime or violence.

00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:29.760
 - Well, if you've got no law,

00:21:29.760 --> 00:21:31.000
 you're not gonna have any reported crime.

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:33.800
 - Yeah, that's just from supposedly the people.

00:21:33.800 --> 00:21:35.440
 - A naked man stole my third wife.

00:21:35.440 --> 00:21:38.440
 (all laughing)

00:21:38.440 --> 00:21:41.960
 - Josiah Warren also invented a lamp, time lamp.

00:21:41.960 --> 00:21:44.040
 Just a non-time lamp.

00:21:44.040 --> 00:21:45.960
 It burned over time, but again,

00:21:45.960 --> 00:21:48.680
 it had a utopian idea at its core,

00:21:48.680 --> 00:21:49.840
 which was to save people money.

00:21:49.840 --> 00:21:51.720
 So it was made of lard instead of tallow

00:21:51.720 --> 00:21:54.640
 and it burned much more efficiently.

00:21:54.640 --> 00:21:56.640
 But the good thing about this lamp

00:21:56.640 --> 00:21:59.560
 is that the patent for it was destroyed

00:21:59.560 --> 00:22:03.400
 in a fire at the patent factory in 1836.

00:22:03.400 --> 00:22:04.480
 - That's very funny.

00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:07.120
 Isn't that true of like the fire extinguisher?

00:22:07.120 --> 00:22:09.040
 - That's correct, it's the same fire.

00:22:09.040 --> 00:22:09.960
 - It was the same fire.

00:22:09.960 --> 00:22:12.800
 - Well, it was this huge, it was an incredibly famous fire

00:22:12.800 --> 00:22:14.920
 and there are these things called the ex patents,

00:22:14.920 --> 00:22:16.840
 which are the first 10,000 patents.

00:22:16.840 --> 00:22:18.880
 And I know I should be saying patents, sorry,

00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:21.520
 but the first 10,000 patents ever issued

00:22:21.520 --> 00:22:23.720
 and they were all destroyed in this fire,

00:22:23.720 --> 00:22:26.440
 this massive fire at the US patent office.

00:22:26.440 --> 00:22:28.040
 - It feels like there's a good plot for a movie

00:22:28.040 --> 00:22:30.320
 or something in there where they're rediscovered

00:22:30.320 --> 00:22:31.920
 actually that we've made copies.

00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:33.280
 - Yeah. - Someone made copies

00:22:33.280 --> 00:22:35.400
 and all these new technologies turn up.

00:22:35.400 --> 00:22:37.760
 - Yeah, the ex patent man.

00:22:37.760 --> 00:22:38.600
 - Yeah, that's quite good.

00:22:38.600 --> 00:22:39.720
 - That's excellent.

00:22:39.720 --> 00:22:42.640
 - He made a newspaper as well, Warren, in 1833.

00:22:42.640 --> 00:22:44.000
 So a few years after the shop,

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:46.160
 for which he built his own printing press

00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:48.480
 and cast all the type himself.

00:22:48.480 --> 00:22:50.960
 He does seem to have been very practical, practically minded.

00:22:50.960 --> 00:22:53.240
 - He also invented a new kind of music.

00:22:53.240 --> 00:22:55.320
 - Did he, what was that?

00:22:55.320 --> 00:22:56.160
 - Wrap.

00:22:56.160 --> 00:22:58.000
 (all laughing)

00:22:58.000 --> 00:22:58.840
 - Gangster rap.

00:22:58.840 --> 00:23:01.960
 - No, it was called mathematical notation.

00:23:01.960 --> 00:23:02.800
 - Okay.

00:23:02.800 --> 00:23:04.680
 - And it was a way of using maths

00:23:04.680 --> 00:23:07.000
 as opposed to using do-re-mi-far-sol-r-t-do

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:08.280
 was using numbers.

00:23:08.280 --> 00:23:09.640
 - How interesting.

00:23:09.640 --> 00:23:12.760
 He's described as an anarchist

00:23:12.760 --> 00:23:15.960
 and my impression of an anarchist is very different

00:23:15.960 --> 00:23:18.000
 to what it sounds like he was.

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:19.400
 - What do you think of an anarchist?

00:23:19.400 --> 00:23:21.600
 - I guess an anarchist would be someone who's raising hell,

00:23:21.600 --> 00:23:23.400
 like suffragettes were being anarchists

00:23:23.400 --> 00:23:25.600
 when they were bombing places.

00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:27.320
 - And that's a metaphorical anarchist.

00:23:27.320 --> 00:23:28.160
 - Yeah, right.

00:23:28.160 --> 00:23:30.200
 - An anarchist would be just someone who doesn't believe

00:23:30.200 --> 00:23:33.240
 there should be any leaders in society.

00:23:33.240 --> 00:23:34.840
 - Suffragettes are very much not anarchist

00:23:34.840 --> 00:23:37.800
 'cause they wanted to actively get into the role

00:23:37.800 --> 00:23:39.680
 of electing leaders, yes.

00:23:39.680 --> 00:23:40.520
 - It's very weird.

00:23:40.520 --> 00:23:42.960
 So anarchism is, 'cause everyone calls for an anarchist,

00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:45.680
 is this big school of thought, exactly as James says,

00:23:45.680 --> 00:23:47.680
 it's not, we don't want leaders,

00:23:47.680 --> 00:23:49.480
 no sort of state structures,

00:23:49.480 --> 00:23:51.160
 people doing things for themselves and their neighbors

00:23:51.160 --> 00:23:53.120
 is the basic idea behind it.

00:23:53.120 --> 00:23:55.480
 But also there is a kind of extreme end of it

00:23:55.480 --> 00:23:57.760
 in the 1890s, it was a big worry across Europe,

00:23:57.760 --> 00:24:01.080
 the anarchists, who were mostly basically young men

00:24:01.080 --> 00:24:03.720
 throwing these kind of like classic bombs,

00:24:03.720 --> 00:24:05.560
 which are sort of big back black wool.

00:24:05.560 --> 00:24:06.400
 - Cherry bombs.

00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:08.000
 - Yeah, with bomb written on the side

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:09.120
 and with a fuse sticking out of it

00:24:09.120 --> 00:24:11.920
 and throwing them at sort of elected leaders

00:24:11.920 --> 00:24:13.440
 or royals across Europe.

00:24:13.440 --> 00:24:14.520
 - Wiley Coyote.

00:24:14.520 --> 00:24:17.040
 - Yeah, it is like that, but it was a genuine fear

00:24:17.040 --> 00:24:19.520
 'cause that was the sort of extreme end of anarchism.

00:24:19.520 --> 00:24:20.880
 But President William McKinley,

00:24:20.880 --> 00:24:22.440
 one of the four presidents assassinated,

00:24:22.440 --> 00:24:23.920
 shot by an anarchist.

00:24:23.920 --> 00:24:26.640
 And his assassin was a guy called Leon Chogosh,

00:24:26.640 --> 00:24:29.000
 who was, this is very dark, this,

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:31.440
 he was tried and executed.

00:24:31.440 --> 00:24:35.160
 And then his body was destroyed by acid

00:24:35.160 --> 00:24:37.480
 so that fellow anarchists wouldn't have a body to venerate

00:24:37.480 --> 00:24:38.920
 or to turn into a martyr.

00:24:38.920 --> 00:24:41.720
 So they literally poured acid into the coffin.

00:24:41.720 --> 00:24:42.560
 - Wow.

00:24:42.560 --> 00:24:43.400
 - Put it in the coffin, close the coffin up,

00:24:43.400 --> 00:24:45.560
 pour acid in, and then burned all his clothes

00:24:45.560 --> 00:24:46.760
 and possessions after that.

00:24:46.760 --> 00:24:47.600
 - Wow.

00:24:47.600 --> 00:24:48.440
 - I know.

00:24:48.440 --> 00:24:49.280
 - Don't do that again.

00:24:49.280 --> 00:24:51.400
 (laughing)

00:24:51.400 --> 00:24:52.560
 - And then we get the sex pistols,

00:24:52.560 --> 00:24:55.560
 kind of calms down the world of Anarchy, doesn't it?

00:24:55.560 --> 00:24:56.400
 - Yeah.

00:24:56.400 --> 00:24:57.240
 - The illusion of an anarchist.

00:24:57.240 --> 00:24:58.200
 - If you buy it, if you buy a t-shirt of it,

00:24:58.200 --> 00:25:00.080
 it's not as anarchic as, yeah.

00:25:00.080 --> 00:25:01.880
 (laughing)

00:25:01.880 --> 00:25:05.120
 - I was looking into the idea of swapping money for time

00:25:05.120 --> 00:25:07.000
 and seeing if that's been used anywhere else.

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:08.240
 And I found an example,

00:25:08.240 --> 00:25:12.040
 which is something that's been trialed in 2019 in Estonia.

00:25:12.040 --> 00:25:13.880
 They've had a huge problem with speeding drivers.

00:25:13.880 --> 00:25:16.160
 So people are speeding, they're getting tickets,

00:25:16.160 --> 00:25:17.960
 and then they are just paying the fine

00:25:17.960 --> 00:25:19.200
 because they can afford to do it.

00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:20.800
 And so in Estonia, they thought,

00:25:20.800 --> 00:25:22.320
 instead of giving them a fine,

00:25:22.320 --> 00:25:24.200
 what if anyone who's caught speeding

00:25:24.200 --> 00:25:27.080
 has to do a 45 to 60 minute timeout?

00:25:27.080 --> 00:25:29.400
 And now they're really late to where they need to go.

00:25:29.400 --> 00:25:30.560
 They have no choice but to do this.

00:25:30.560 --> 00:25:31.400
 - That's great.

00:25:31.400 --> 00:25:32.880
 - 57% of people actually said

00:25:32.880 --> 00:25:35.240
 they preferred the idea of having the timeout.

00:25:35.240 --> 00:25:36.680
 So the biggest problem they have is,

00:25:36.680 --> 00:25:38.240
 - Meanwhile, James has pulled in behind the guy

00:25:38.240 --> 00:25:39.560
 who's been stopped for speeding.

00:25:39.560 --> 00:25:40.400
 He doesn't mind.

00:25:40.400 --> 00:25:42.640
 (laughing)

00:25:42.640 --> 00:25:46.120
 - How are you policing that?

00:25:46.120 --> 00:25:48.600
 - This is what they're trying to work out

00:25:48.600 --> 00:25:49.920
 because it takes a lot of people

00:25:49.920 --> 00:25:51.600
 to have to sit there for an hour.

00:25:51.600 --> 00:25:53.120
 It's not practical, but it's a great idea

00:25:53.120 --> 00:25:55.680
 because no matter how rich you are, time is time,

00:25:55.680 --> 00:25:57.360
 you can't get past that.

00:25:57.360 --> 00:25:58.200
 - It's not practical, guys.

00:25:58.200 --> 00:25:59.040
 Well, what you could do is,

00:25:59.040 --> 00:26:01.040
 you could put some clamps on the car

00:26:01.040 --> 00:26:02.080
 and so they can't go anywhere

00:26:02.080 --> 00:26:03.920
 and then come back an hour later and take it off.

00:26:03.920 --> 00:26:06.080
 - But most speeders are called by cameras, aren't they?

00:26:06.080 --> 00:26:07.440
 Maybe out of every camera,

00:26:07.440 --> 00:26:11.280
 it could drop a sort of big net that catches the car.

00:26:11.280 --> 00:26:12.760
 - Yeah, that's much more practical.

00:26:12.760 --> 00:26:14.760
 - Yes, I'm a craxit.

00:26:14.760 --> 00:26:17.120
 - Hiring some unemployed people to do the same work.

00:26:17.120 --> 00:26:20.320
 Kind of like detention for grown-ups, basically.

00:26:20.320 --> 00:26:23.000
 - I have a related fact because it's about Estonia.

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:29.520
 I was in Estonia relatively recently, last year in Tallinn,

00:26:29.520 --> 00:26:32.560
 and I went to the Museum of Banned Books.

00:26:32.560 --> 00:26:33.400
 - Oh, cool, yeah.

00:26:33.400 --> 00:26:35.800
 - So it's a museum, but it's also a shop.

00:26:35.800 --> 00:26:38.600
 You can buy books that have been banned from around the world.

00:26:38.600 --> 00:26:40.880
 And I asked for one particular book

00:26:40.880 --> 00:26:44.560
 and they had it hidden behind the desk,

00:26:44.560 --> 00:26:46.440
 as it wasn't on display.

00:26:46.440 --> 00:26:48.880
 Can you guess what the book is?

00:26:48.880 --> 00:26:51.320
 So they had every banned book from around the world.

00:26:51.320 --> 00:26:52.720
 And I said, "Oh, do you have this one?"

00:26:52.720 --> 00:26:54.880
 And they went, "We do, but it's behind the desk.

00:26:54.880 --> 00:26:56.120
 We're not allowed to put it on display."

00:26:56.120 --> 00:26:57.320
 Oh, we're not putting it on display.

00:26:57.320 --> 00:26:58.160
 - Is it a famous book?

00:26:58.160 --> 00:26:59.240
 Will you definitely have heard of it?

00:26:59.240 --> 00:27:00.920
 - It's famous, but whether you've heard of it,

00:27:00.920 --> 00:27:02.120
 I don't know. - How?

00:27:02.120 --> 00:27:04.720
 - I mean, it's very on topic from what we're talking about.

00:27:04.720 --> 00:27:07.680
 - Oh, okay, so a time-related thing maybe.

00:27:07.680 --> 00:27:09.160
 - Or an anarchist's book.

00:27:09.160 --> 00:27:10.200
 - The anarchist's cookbook.

00:27:10.200 --> 00:27:11.880
 - Correct. - Oh!

00:27:11.880 --> 00:27:16.160
 - The anarchist's cookbook is in the Museum of Banned Books,

00:27:16.160 --> 00:27:18.120
 but isn't on display. - Why not?

00:27:18.120 --> 00:27:19.920
 - Because it's so dangerous.

00:27:19.920 --> 00:27:21.360
 - What is it? - What is it?

00:27:21.360 --> 00:27:24.800
 - It's a way of making bombs, basically.

00:27:24.800 --> 00:27:25.640
 - Okay.

00:27:25.640 --> 00:27:28.200
 - Also making illicit drugs,

00:27:28.200 --> 00:27:31.720
 ways of freaking telecommunication devices.

00:27:31.720 --> 00:27:34.640
 So this was written by a guy called Powell,

00:27:34.640 --> 00:27:36.360
 whose first name I can't remember,

00:27:36.360 --> 00:27:40.240
 but anyway, he reneged on it when he got older.

00:27:40.240 --> 00:27:43.000
 It was published in 1971, and by 1976,

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:44.560
 he'd converted to Anglicanism

00:27:44.560 --> 00:27:47.280
 and tried to get his book taken from circulation.

00:27:48.280 --> 00:27:50.440
 And in 2011, he and his wife,

00:27:50.440 --> 00:27:51.920
 Och and Kasuma Powell,

00:27:51.920 --> 00:27:54.880
 founded a thing called Next Frontier Inclusion,

00:27:54.880 --> 00:27:57.160
 which was a non-profit organization for children

00:27:57.160 --> 00:27:58.960
 with learning disabilities.

00:27:58.960 --> 00:28:01.720
 But he did that in a way to atone for this book

00:28:01.720 --> 00:28:03.920
 that he'd written, which he can't control

00:28:03.920 --> 00:28:05.840
 because he doesn't own the copyright to it anymore.

00:28:05.840 --> 00:28:07.760
 It's out there, and that's it.

00:28:07.760 --> 00:28:09.360
 - Did he do an anarchist thing with the copyright

00:28:09.360 --> 00:28:10.640
 or something, or did it just,

00:28:10.640 --> 00:28:11.680
 it just got out of there and it's been replicated?

00:28:11.680 --> 00:28:13.760
 - No, it was the amount of time

00:28:13.760 --> 00:28:16.040
 it just sort of went to the publisher.

00:28:16.040 --> 00:28:19.320
 - Silly boy, think before you publish.

00:28:19.320 --> 00:28:20.640
 - I really thought you were going to say

00:28:20.640 --> 00:28:22.160
 the book that you couldn't access, James,

00:28:22.160 --> 00:28:23.640
 was Tintin and the Soviets.

00:28:23.640 --> 00:28:24.960
 - Oh, that is true.

00:28:24.960 --> 00:28:27.200
 Like, I went to the Tintin shop in London

00:28:27.200 --> 00:28:29.040
 and they wouldn't, they would sell it to me,

00:28:29.040 --> 00:28:30.720
 but again, it was not on display.

00:28:30.720 --> 00:28:33.120
 - You have a knack of finding things behind the counter.

00:28:33.120 --> 00:28:34.440
 (laughing)

00:28:34.440 --> 00:28:35.760
 It's interesting.

00:28:35.760 --> 00:28:39.280
 You can work out what will most freak out any shopkeeper.

00:28:39.280 --> 00:28:41.040
 - But that they will own, you know.

00:28:41.040 --> 00:28:42.640
 - But they will own, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:28:42.640 --> 00:28:44.120
 - I was just looking at money,

00:28:44.120 --> 00:28:46.080
 the times when money's been abolished.

00:28:46.080 --> 00:28:47.800
 Do you know the only country to abolish money?

00:28:47.800 --> 00:28:50.480
 - Oh, I'm going to say Bhutan.

00:28:50.480 --> 00:28:52.480
 - Oh, I have some boots of these kinds.

00:28:52.480 --> 00:28:56.120
 - Okay, I'd like to change my choice to,

00:28:56.120 --> 00:28:57.560
 let's say a communist one.

00:28:57.560 --> 00:28:58.400
 - Yeah.

00:28:58.400 --> 00:28:59.240
 - Cuba.

00:28:59.240 --> 00:29:01.360
 - Oh, no, Angola.

00:29:01.360 --> 00:29:02.200
 - You've got the right,

00:29:02.200 --> 00:29:03.440
 and he's got the right first letter.

00:29:03.440 --> 00:29:05.760
 It's definitely less utopian than Bhutan.

00:29:05.760 --> 00:29:07.160
 - Columbia.

00:29:07.160 --> 00:29:08.600
 - Well, it's, I'm just going to tell you.

00:29:08.600 --> 00:29:10.560
 Same number of syllables.

00:29:10.560 --> 00:29:11.400
 - Begins with C.

00:29:11.400 --> 00:29:12.240
 - Yep. - Begins with C.

00:29:12.240 --> 00:29:13.560
 - All syllables. - Columbia.

00:29:13.560 --> 00:29:15.480
 - Oh, no, it's, yeah, same number of syllables.

00:29:15.480 --> 00:29:16.880
 Four syllables. - Four syllables.

00:29:16.880 --> 00:29:17.840
 - Cambodia.

00:29:17.840 --> 00:29:19.680
 - Very good.

00:29:19.680 --> 00:29:20.760
 - Under the Khmerz, was it?

00:29:20.760 --> 00:29:23.320
 - Cambodia, under the Khmerz, Pol Pot,

00:29:23.320 --> 00:29:27.240
 who decided to ban money in 1975 when he came into power,

00:29:27.240 --> 00:29:30.040
 and within three weeks, there was a new currency,

00:29:30.040 --> 00:29:33.120
 but then he decided that he didn't want a new currency,

00:29:33.120 --> 00:29:35.040
 so he blew up the central bank.

00:29:35.040 --> 00:29:38.800
 I mean, obviously he did some absolutely appalling things

00:29:38.800 --> 00:29:41.880
 alongside this, but yeah, blew up the central bank,

00:29:41.880 --> 00:29:44.240
 and money flooded through the streets,

00:29:44.240 --> 00:29:45.920
 and people were using it because Cambodia

00:29:45.920 --> 00:29:48.200
 was in a terrible state by that point because of them.

00:29:48.200 --> 00:29:50.760
 We were burning money for fire and warrants.

00:29:50.760 --> 00:29:52.600
 - How interesting, wow. - Because it didn't exist.

00:29:52.600 --> 00:29:53.720
 - When I was in Cambodia,

00:29:53.720 --> 00:29:55.480
 which I admittedly was quite a while ago,

00:29:55.480 --> 00:29:57.640
 you would really just buy stuff in dollars.

00:29:57.640 --> 00:29:59.560
 - Yeah, same, yeah.

00:29:59.560 --> 00:30:03.240
 Do you know the commonest denomination of US dollars?

00:30:03.240 --> 00:30:05.320
 - One dollar, it must be one dollar.

00:30:05.320 --> 00:30:07.520
 - Used to be, in 2016, it was replaced.

00:30:07.520 --> 00:30:08.720
 It's now the second most common.

00:30:08.720 --> 00:30:11.680
 - I'm going to go all the way, the thousand dollar.

00:30:11.680 --> 00:30:14.120
 - I'm going to go in the middle, the seven dollar.

00:30:14.120 --> 00:30:15.920
 (laughing)

00:30:15.920 --> 00:30:18.400
 - And you've gone too far into the realms of unreality.

00:30:18.400 --> 00:30:19.400
 - It's a hundred, it's going to be a hundred.

00:30:19.400 --> 00:30:22.040
 - It's a hundred, it's the hundred dollar banknote.

00:30:22.040 --> 00:30:23.320
 Isn't that insane?

00:30:23.320 --> 00:30:25.760
 A hundred dollar bills make up almost 80%

00:30:25.760 --> 00:30:27.440
 of the value of dollars worldwide,

00:30:27.440 --> 00:30:30.360
 and they are now the most commonly circulated bill,

00:30:30.360 --> 00:30:32.680
 and it's almost all held outside of the US.

00:30:32.680 --> 00:30:34.000
 - It's a lot of crime though, isn't it?

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:35.240
 - It's a lot of crime. - It's a lot of art,

00:30:35.240 --> 00:30:36.600
 fraudsters, and drug money,

00:30:36.600 --> 00:30:39.600
 because it's large amounts of value in a relatively small--

00:30:39.600 --> 00:30:41.200
 - Still counts. - It's finicky to do that

00:30:41.200 --> 00:30:42.480
 with all one dollar bills, if you're paying for it.

00:30:42.480 --> 00:30:43.320
 - Yeah.

00:30:43.320 --> 00:30:46.200
 - Like 800 kilos of cocaine, and you're at the counter,

00:30:46.200 --> 00:30:47.960
 and the guy in front of you is paying him once.

00:30:47.960 --> 00:30:48.800
 It's annoying.

00:30:48.800 --> 00:30:50.200
 (laughing)

00:30:50.200 --> 00:30:52.640
 - James, just sitting there happily.

00:30:52.640 --> 00:30:53.960
 - You take your time, buddy.

00:30:53.960 --> 00:30:55.400
 - It's all right, I'm going to be buying this stuff

00:30:55.400 --> 00:30:56.680
 he has behind the counter.

00:30:56.680 --> 00:30:58.440
 (laughing)

00:30:58.440 --> 00:31:01.020
 (upbeat music)

00:31:01.020 --> 00:31:07.640
 - Okay, it is time for fact number three, and that is James.

00:31:07.640 --> 00:31:10.920
 - Okay, my fact this week is that the 2023 Nobel Prize

00:31:10.920 --> 00:31:13.840
 for Chemistry was won for discovering something

00:31:13.840 --> 00:31:16.360
 that has been used in stained glass window making

00:31:16.360 --> 00:31:18.080
 for a thousand years.

00:31:18.080 --> 00:31:20.400
 Glass, it was.

00:31:20.400 --> 00:31:22.080
 - Whoa. - Discovered that.

00:31:22.080 --> 00:31:23.160
 - It was a really late award.

00:31:23.160 --> 00:31:25.040
 - We didn't know where it came from before.

00:31:25.040 --> 00:31:26.440
 - No one knew what glass was.

00:31:26.440 --> 00:31:27.280
 - Amazing. - And then they were like,

00:31:27.280 --> 00:31:28.600
 "Oh, it's in all those windows as well."

00:31:28.600 --> 00:31:29.960
 No, it wasn't that.

00:31:29.960 --> 00:31:31.440
 It was Quantum Dots.

00:31:31.440 --> 00:31:38.080
 It was won by Maungi G. Bowendi, Louis E. Bruce,

00:31:38.240 --> 00:31:42.760
 and Alexei Ekimov, and they discovered Quantum Dots,

00:31:42.760 --> 00:31:45.520
 which are tiny, tiny particles.

00:31:45.520 --> 00:31:49.560
 You fire light into them, and depending on their size,

00:31:49.560 --> 00:31:51.800
 they re-emit light of a different color.

00:31:51.800 --> 00:31:54.540
 It's all due to this thing we call science.

00:31:54.540 --> 00:31:55.960
 (laughing)

00:31:55.960 --> 00:31:58.720
 Talking about that, and Quantum Science at that.

00:31:58.720 --> 00:32:01.240
 We don't need to really go into all that stuff today,

00:32:01.240 --> 00:32:03.240
 but scientists have looked at glass back

00:32:03.240 --> 00:32:05.680
 from the 10th century and found tiny bits of gold,

00:32:05.680 --> 00:32:08.520
 tiny bits of silver, and they act in the same way

00:32:08.520 --> 00:32:09.760
 that Quantum Dots act.

00:32:09.760 --> 00:32:12.400
 When the sunlight comes in, they enhance the red light

00:32:12.400 --> 00:32:13.840
 and enhance the yellow light.

00:32:13.840 --> 00:32:18.640
 - And it's the size of the Quantum Dot,

00:32:18.640 --> 00:32:21.240
 which are only, there are a few nanometers across,

00:32:21.240 --> 00:32:24.880
 and the bigger ones emit a different color

00:32:24.880 --> 00:32:26.840
 when light is fired at them than the smaller ones.

00:32:26.840 --> 00:32:28.680
 It's basically--

00:32:28.680 --> 00:32:31.360
 - It took quite a long time for me to understand it,

00:32:31.360 --> 00:32:33.120
 but there's a really good explanation in the article

00:32:33.120 --> 00:32:36.240
 that was sent by the American Chemical Society's president,

00:32:36.240 --> 00:32:38.960
 Judith Goyardun, G-I-O-R-T.

00:32:38.960 --> 00:32:41.440
 - Ironically, pronouncing her name is more difficult

00:32:41.440 --> 00:32:42.480
 than the Quantum Mechanics.

00:32:42.480 --> 00:32:45.640
 - Judith Jordan, and she says to think of it

00:32:45.640 --> 00:32:48.920
 like a little box, so basically the particle is the box,

00:32:48.920 --> 00:32:51.400
 and you have the electrons bashing off the sides

00:32:51.400 --> 00:32:53.440
 of the walls of the box on the inside,

00:32:53.440 --> 00:32:55.560
 but when you've got a big box, it's gonna take longer

00:32:55.560 --> 00:32:57.720
 for the electrons to bash into the size.

00:32:57.720 --> 00:32:59.480
 When the particle is shrunk down,

00:32:59.480 --> 00:33:01.240
 the electrons are bashing quicker and quicker,

00:33:01.240 --> 00:33:03.880
 and that's where it's emitting the different color, basically.

00:33:03.880 --> 00:33:06.360
 So it's to do with the size of the box

00:33:06.360 --> 00:33:08.400
 and the electrons smashing into the sides.

00:33:08.400 --> 00:33:10.320
 - It is hard, it's hard to understand.

00:33:10.320 --> 00:33:11.680
 - The thing is, they glow.

00:33:11.680 --> 00:33:13.040
 They're very exciting 'cause they glow,

00:33:13.040 --> 00:33:14.080
 and they're very colorful,

00:33:14.080 --> 00:33:15.920
 and the reason they've won the Nobel Prize

00:33:15.920 --> 00:33:18.800
 is 'cause they basically made television a bit better.

00:33:18.800 --> 00:33:20.640
 As far as I can tell.

00:33:20.640 --> 00:33:23.800
 - We're gonna have cool quantum tellies, QLEDs.

00:33:23.800 --> 00:33:28.120
 - QLEDs, and it's the same principle as a normal LED TV,

00:33:28.120 --> 00:33:31.560
 which is that light is shone from behind onto the dots.

00:33:31.560 --> 00:33:33.040
 They glow in different colors,

00:33:33.040 --> 00:33:34.840
 and you're watching your show

00:33:34.840 --> 00:33:36.040
 and you don't really need to think about it.

00:33:36.040 --> 00:33:38.160
 - But like if you think about an old computer screen

00:33:38.160 --> 00:33:40.920
 or something, you could only really get like blue

00:33:40.920 --> 00:33:43.320
 and yellow and magenta, like a printer.

00:33:43.320 --> 00:33:46.560
 You only get those colors, and to make any other color,

00:33:46.560 --> 00:33:48.280
 you have to mix them up in different amounts,

00:33:48.280 --> 00:33:50.320
 and you will be able to get a certain number of colors,

00:33:50.320 --> 00:33:53.800
 but these QLEDs can show you way more colors,

00:33:53.800 --> 00:33:56.000
 more colors than you could possibly imagine.

00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:56.960
 - Yes. - Yes.

00:33:56.960 --> 00:33:58.920
 - Like teal.

00:33:58.920 --> 00:33:59.760
 - Wow. - Incredible.

00:33:59.760 --> 00:34:01.420
 - I can't imagine that. - Now with teals.

00:34:01.420 --> 00:34:02.360
 - Incredible. - Yeah.

00:34:02.360 --> 00:34:03.200
 - And mauve.

00:34:03.200 --> 00:34:04.540
 - Yeah.

00:34:04.540 --> 00:34:05.380
 - Puce.

00:34:05.380 --> 00:34:08.080
 - And we should just say in defense

00:34:08.080 --> 00:34:09.560
 of the Nobel Prize-winning scientists

00:34:09.560 --> 00:34:11.680
 that they are used for other things as well.

00:34:11.680 --> 00:34:14.000
 They're gonna hopefully revolutionize the world of medicine

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:16.200
 because you're gonna be able to spot the colors

00:34:16.200 --> 00:34:17.360
 on the inside of the body,

00:34:17.360 --> 00:34:19.600
 so they're gonna be used for diagnosing certain bits

00:34:19.600 --> 00:34:20.440
 of the body. - What?

00:34:20.440 --> 00:34:22.040
 - Yeah. - How do you mean?

00:34:22.040 --> 00:34:24.560
 - I don't know if you've explained that the right way,

00:34:24.560 --> 00:34:26.560
 it's spot the colors on the inside of the body.

00:34:26.560 --> 00:34:29.200
 - Do you mean send markers into the body

00:34:29.200 --> 00:34:30.240
 that can identify- - Exactly.

00:34:30.240 --> 00:34:32.840
 - It's like, "Oh, you've got a green liver.

00:34:32.840 --> 00:34:35.760
 You've got an orange pancreas."

00:34:35.760 --> 00:34:38.360
 - It's the leave to highlight spots

00:34:38.360 --> 00:34:40.280
 where you need to monitor and make sure that things,

00:34:40.280 --> 00:34:41.840
 and that's the opening application of it,

00:34:41.840 --> 00:34:44.040
 just on nanotechnology and medicine,

00:34:44.040 --> 00:34:45.840
 and this is another cool use of nanotech.

00:34:45.840 --> 00:34:47.560
 This is nano shells.

00:34:47.560 --> 00:34:49.880
 So these are hollow gold or silver spheres

00:34:49.880 --> 00:34:51.000
 wrapped around silica.

00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:51.960
 Okay, so I think they are hollow,

00:34:51.960 --> 00:34:53.640
 but they're two layers. - Okay.

00:34:53.640 --> 00:34:56.360
 - Like a Ferrero Rocher, but small.

00:34:56.360 --> 00:34:58.920
 But so small that you could eat lots and it wouldn't matter.

00:34:58.920 --> 00:35:01.640
 So if you fire light at these nano shells,

00:35:01.640 --> 00:35:02.640
 they heat up massively,

00:35:02.640 --> 00:35:04.480
 'cause they're made of gold and silver, right?

00:35:04.480 --> 00:35:07.600
 So the idea is, if you have someone who's got cancer,

00:35:07.600 --> 00:35:11.240
 you can inject the tumor with these nano shells,

00:35:11.240 --> 00:35:13.200
 then you fire infrared light.

00:35:13.200 --> 00:35:16.440
 Now, the light passes through the water in your cells

00:35:16.440 --> 00:35:18.520
 because the water in your cells

00:35:18.520 --> 00:35:19.960
 doesn't absorb much infrared light.

00:35:19.960 --> 00:35:23.160
 These nano shells absorb huge amounts of infrared light.

00:35:23.160 --> 00:35:27.200
 They heat up massively and it kills the tumor off, right?

00:35:27.200 --> 00:35:28.440
 So if you can, yeah,

00:35:28.440 --> 00:35:31.320
 and they're experimenting at the moment on raw chicken,

00:35:31.320 --> 00:35:33.960
 but the hope is that it'll make the leap

00:35:33.960 --> 00:35:36.480
 from raw chicken to people.

00:35:36.480 --> 00:35:37.800
 It's a really clever idea.

00:35:37.800 --> 00:35:39.400
 - Are they basically cooking chicken

00:35:39.400 --> 00:35:41.120
 by putting these nano dots inside it?

00:35:41.120 --> 00:35:43.040
 - Effectively, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:35:43.040 --> 00:35:43.880
 - That's clever.

00:35:43.880 --> 00:35:45.160
 - Very cool. - That's really good.

00:35:45.160 --> 00:35:46.000
 - It's a good idea.

00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:47.800
 - Quicker cooking in better tellies.

00:35:47.800 --> 00:35:51.840
 - When Ekimov first came up with the idea of quantum dots,

00:35:51.840 --> 00:35:55.920
 he was working at the Vavilyev State Optical Institute

00:35:55.920 --> 00:35:57.240
 in Soviet Russia.

00:35:57.240 --> 00:36:00.560
 And he had got these special glass objects,

00:36:00.560 --> 00:36:04.080
 semiconductor glass objects, known as shot glasses.

00:36:04.080 --> 00:36:05.400
 - Whee!

00:36:05.400 --> 00:36:06.240
 - Sorry.

00:36:06.240 --> 00:36:07.080
 - Isn't that cool?

00:36:07.080 --> 00:36:08.400
 They were known as shot glasses

00:36:08.400 --> 00:36:09.640
 and they were lots of different colors

00:36:09.640 --> 00:36:12.200
 and he developed the theories to explain their color.

00:36:12.200 --> 00:36:14.000
 And the interesting thing about those shot glasses

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:17.960
 is they were made by a company founded by Otto Schott.

00:36:17.960 --> 00:36:20.320
 Okay, and that company still exists

00:36:20.320 --> 00:36:25.320
 and they made 90% of the first one billion COVID vaccine bottles.

00:36:25.320 --> 00:36:26.800
 - Wow.

00:36:26.800 --> 00:36:29.400
 - So 90% of the first billion COVID vaccines

00:36:29.400 --> 00:36:31.120
 were delivered in shot glasses.

00:36:31.120 --> 00:36:33.360
 - Lovely, beautiful. - That's really cool.

00:36:33.360 --> 00:36:35.560
 - That's great, so funny.

00:36:35.560 --> 00:36:36.720
 - Ekimov, who you mentioned,

00:36:36.720 --> 00:36:39.640
 as you say, he was in Soviet Union in 1981

00:36:39.640 --> 00:36:42.280
 when he became, in fact, the first person, I think,

00:36:42.280 --> 00:36:44.960
 to generate these quantum dots and to identify them

00:36:44.960 --> 00:36:46.480
 and learn how to generate them.

00:36:46.480 --> 00:36:48.040
 But it's just one of those amazing things.

00:36:48.040 --> 00:36:50.000
 It's so weird how often you read about this,

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:51.760
 I guess, when we do what we do,

00:36:51.760 --> 00:36:53.520
 things happening simultaneously.

00:36:53.520 --> 00:36:56.360
 It just shows how predictable a path humans are on, I think,

00:36:56.360 --> 00:36:58.400
 because is it Bruce?

00:36:58.400 --> 00:36:59.440
 Do you pronounce it, do you know?

00:36:59.440 --> 00:37:00.560
 - That's how I pronounced it.

00:37:00.560 --> 00:37:01.800
 - Cool.

00:37:01.800 --> 00:37:02.720
 - It could be brew.

00:37:02.720 --> 00:37:03.680
 - Brew, okay.

00:37:03.680 --> 00:37:05.160
 - Fancy a brew?

00:37:05.160 --> 00:37:06.800
 - Fancy a brew in your shot glass.

00:37:06.800 --> 00:37:08.960
 - Is that Scottish?

00:37:08.960 --> 00:37:09.800
 - Scouts, I think.

00:37:09.800 --> 00:37:11.240
 - I don't know, I don't know.

00:37:11.240 --> 00:37:14.440
 (all laughing)

00:37:14.440 --> 00:37:16.800
 At exactly the same time in America,

00:37:16.800 --> 00:37:19.360
 Louis Bruce was working on the similar thing

00:37:19.360 --> 00:37:22.320
 and he came up with it pretty much a year later, I think.

00:37:22.320 --> 00:37:23.800
 And the interesting thing was,

00:37:23.800 --> 00:37:25.080
 I hadn't realised at the Soviet Union,

00:37:25.080 --> 00:37:26.480
 if you did science there at the time,

00:37:26.480 --> 00:37:27.920
 it basically didn't get anywhere

00:37:27.920 --> 00:37:30.920
 because you had to publish it in extremely obscure journals

00:37:30.920 --> 00:37:33.040
 that no Western scientists were really reading

00:37:33.040 --> 00:37:34.280
 'cause it was all thought it was a bit backwards.

00:37:34.280 --> 00:37:35.280
 - And in Russian as well.

00:37:35.280 --> 00:37:38.720
 - And in Russian, which, you know, a lot of us can't read.

00:37:38.720 --> 00:37:41.680
 And so Bruce, a year or two later,

00:37:41.680 --> 00:37:43.960
 read this thing in a journal and good on him,

00:37:43.960 --> 00:37:44.800
 he read it and was like,

00:37:44.800 --> 00:37:47.200
 "Oh, that guy's done the thing I did a bit before me."

00:37:47.200 --> 00:37:49.680
 So got in touch with him, wrote him a letter to say,

00:37:49.680 --> 00:37:50.520
 "Shall we hook up?"

00:37:50.520 --> 00:37:52.040
 - A very, what?

00:37:52.040 --> 00:37:52.880
 That's, wow.

00:37:52.880 --> 00:37:54.920
 - Then they had a beautiful romance blast.

00:37:54.920 --> 00:37:55.760
 - Wow.

00:37:55.760 --> 00:37:57.440
 (all laughing)

00:37:57.440 --> 00:38:00.280
 - Amongi Balwadi, who was the third person

00:38:00.280 --> 00:38:01.240
 who won the Nobel Prize,

00:38:01.240 --> 00:38:03.720
 failed his first chemistry test at Harvard.

00:38:03.720 --> 00:38:07.000
 And he was specifically the chemist who came on board

00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:09.480
 to sort of make what the other two had discovered

00:38:09.480 --> 00:38:11.320
 become practically applicable.

00:38:11.320 --> 00:38:13.480
 And yeah, he did a speech recently saying,

00:38:13.480 --> 00:38:14.520
 he failed the chemistry test

00:38:14.520 --> 00:38:17.040
 and actually got the worst grade in his whole class.

00:38:17.040 --> 00:38:19.320
 And said, "That could have destroyed me,

00:38:19.320 --> 00:38:21.600
 "but I decided that it wouldn't."

00:38:21.600 --> 00:38:23.640
 And it was such a...

00:38:23.640 --> 00:38:25.080
 - I decided that it wouldn't.

00:38:25.080 --> 00:38:26.400
 - I decided.

00:38:26.400 --> 00:38:27.480
 And that's the lesson.

00:38:27.480 --> 00:38:28.640
 Good luck, guys.

00:38:28.640 --> 00:38:31.760
 There was like, there's a book about archery,

00:38:31.760 --> 00:38:33.600
 about the best way to be an archer,

00:38:33.600 --> 00:38:34.560
 like a really old one.

00:38:34.560 --> 00:38:37.440
 And the first line is, "First, decide to succeed."

00:38:37.440 --> 00:38:39.360
 - Wow, that's so good.

00:38:39.360 --> 00:38:41.080
 - That's awesome.

00:38:41.080 --> 00:38:43.160
 I really like that these three winners, by the way,

00:38:43.160 --> 00:38:45.880
 they all advanced it in a slightly different way.

00:38:45.880 --> 00:38:47.240
 Each brought something new to it.

00:38:47.240 --> 00:38:50.040
 And I do like that the Nobel Prize system works like that,

00:38:50.040 --> 00:38:51.200
 that it's not just the person

00:38:51.200 --> 00:38:53.440
 who's found the application to the thing,

00:38:53.440 --> 00:38:54.880
 it's the person who identified it.

00:38:54.880 --> 00:38:58.320
 It's like giving a goal score in football,

00:38:58.320 --> 00:39:00.600
 not only to the person who's kicked or headed the ball in,

00:39:00.600 --> 00:39:02.120
 but to the assist.

00:39:02.120 --> 00:39:04.520
 And then even to someone who passed it to the assist.

00:39:04.520 --> 00:39:06.800
 - The whole team gets that goal.

00:39:06.800 --> 00:39:08.320
 It actually, football does work like that,

00:39:08.320 --> 00:39:11.560
 because goals are not given to individual players.

00:39:11.560 --> 00:39:13.240
 You're schooling me on football.

00:39:13.240 --> 00:39:15.560
 - But increasingly, you do find out

00:39:15.560 --> 00:39:17.160
 who the assist was for every goal.

00:39:17.160 --> 00:39:18.000
 - Yeah.

00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:19.200
 - And when you do, yeah.

00:39:19.200 --> 00:39:20.040
 - Yeah, you always do.

00:39:20.040 --> 00:39:21.760
 - And when they talk about, let's say,

00:39:21.760 --> 00:39:23.960
 Mbappe's done whatever he's done this season,

00:39:23.960 --> 00:39:26.040
 they'll say he's got this many goals and this many assists,

00:39:26.040 --> 00:39:27.440
 and they will mention it each time.

00:39:27.440 --> 00:39:28.280
 - Oh, I see.

00:39:28.280 --> 00:39:30.320
 - And I think it kind of began from fancy football,

00:39:30.320 --> 00:39:33.120
 because you get points for how many goals your player scored,

00:39:33.120 --> 00:39:34.080
 but they wanted to give points

00:39:34.080 --> 00:39:35.880
 to the people who were creating the goals,

00:39:35.880 --> 00:39:36.720
 and they get to them as well.

00:39:36.720 --> 00:39:37.680
 - Really? - Wow.

00:39:37.680 --> 00:39:40.040
 - Well, I've forgotten that it wasn't always like that.

00:39:40.040 --> 00:39:41.160
 - Definitely not, yeah.

00:39:41.160 --> 00:39:44.080
 - The Nobel Prize for Medicine this year,

00:39:44.080 --> 00:39:45.440
 or last year in 2023,

00:39:45.440 --> 00:39:49.040
 was given to Kathleen Caracol and Drew Weisman

00:39:49.040 --> 00:39:53.320
 for some mRNA vaccine stuff for COVID,

00:39:53.320 --> 00:39:57.520
 but they had the initial manuscript rejected by nature

00:39:57.520 --> 00:39:59.200
 and by science. - Really?

00:39:59.200 --> 00:40:00.040
 - No way.

00:40:00.040 --> 00:40:01.360
 - And they were rejected by nature.

00:40:01.360 --> 00:40:03.440
 - Do you mean by the journals, "Nature and Science"?

00:40:03.440 --> 00:40:05.200
 - Yes. (laughing)

00:40:05.200 --> 00:40:07.320
 - Also, "God and Man" were rejected.

00:40:07.320 --> 00:40:08.480
 (laughing)

00:40:08.480 --> 00:40:09.320
 Your work.

00:40:10.360 --> 00:40:15.120
 - Yeah, so "Nature" the journal rejected it within 24 hours.

00:40:15.120 --> 00:40:15.960
 - Oh.

00:40:15.960 --> 00:40:18.520
 - And so they didn't even send it to any reviewers or whatever.

00:40:18.520 --> 00:40:20.040
 They just got the letter through the post

00:40:20.040 --> 00:40:21.040
 and went, "This is shit."

00:40:21.040 --> 00:40:22.120
 - Really? - And just threw it away.

00:40:22.120 --> 00:40:22.960
 - Wow.

00:40:22.960 --> 00:40:23.800
 - What did you say it was for?

00:40:23.800 --> 00:40:24.960
 It was for mRNA?

00:40:24.960 --> 00:40:28.880
 - It was for developing more effective mRNA vaccines

00:40:28.880 --> 00:40:30.320
 against COVID-19.

00:40:30.320 --> 00:40:32.040
 - I just, I really worry about sort of Trump

00:40:32.040 --> 00:40:32.880
 listening to this and going,

00:40:32.880 --> 00:40:35.800
 "See, I told you, nature and science agree with me."

00:40:35.800 --> 00:40:37.920
 - But what it was is that they didn't think

00:40:37.920 --> 00:40:40.160
 that it was a big enough advancement.

00:40:40.160 --> 00:40:43.560
 They thought they were just kind of repeating old things

00:40:43.560 --> 00:40:44.680
 that people had already said,

00:40:44.680 --> 00:40:46.480
 but actually later on they realized

00:40:46.480 --> 00:40:48.880
 that it was actually a big, big advancement.

00:40:48.880 --> 00:40:53.080
 The 2023 Nobel Prize for Physics,

00:40:53.080 --> 00:40:55.200
 which was won by Pierre Agostini,

00:40:55.200 --> 00:40:57.760
 Ferench Kraus and Anne Wheelier,

00:40:57.760 --> 00:41:00.680
 is a way of measuring things

00:41:00.680 --> 00:41:03.480
 with atto-second pulses of light.

00:41:03.480 --> 00:41:06.880
 An atto-second is even shorter than a nanosecond.

00:41:06.880 --> 00:41:09.960
 It's extremely, extremely short amount of time.

00:41:10.360 --> 00:41:13.400
 In fact, it's one quintillionth of a second.

00:41:13.400 --> 00:41:14.920
 And if you wanted to have a quick meeting

00:41:14.920 --> 00:41:16.920
 with every insect on earth,

00:41:16.920 --> 00:41:20.040
 but had to complete all the meetings in one second,

00:41:20.040 --> 00:41:23.120
 then each insect would get an atto-second of your time.

00:41:23.120 --> 00:41:23.960
 - Oh.

00:41:23.960 --> 00:41:26.240
 Food for thought.

00:41:26.240 --> 00:41:28.680
 - And they managed to make these pulses of light,

00:41:28.680 --> 00:41:31.160
 each one an atto-second in length.

00:41:31.160 --> 00:41:34.560
 And that means that if you think about a movie

00:41:34.560 --> 00:41:37.120
 has however many frames per second,

00:41:37.120 --> 00:41:39.720
 if you can make one every atto-second,

00:41:39.720 --> 00:41:41.160
 then suddenly you can see things

00:41:41.160 --> 00:41:43.120
 that are happening almost instantaneously.

00:41:43.120 --> 00:41:45.120
 - I just find that when I'm watching films,

00:41:45.120 --> 00:41:46.520
 and I don't mean to denigrate these people,

00:41:46.520 --> 00:41:48.280
 but I find the colors fine

00:41:48.280 --> 00:41:50.760
 and the speed at which I see things happening is fine.

00:41:50.760 --> 00:41:52.440
 - You're still confused about the plot 10 minutes in.

00:41:52.440 --> 00:41:54.280
 It doesn't matter.

00:41:54.280 --> 00:41:55.120
 - I'm sorry.

00:41:55.120 --> 00:41:57.120
 I should say that these atto-second stuff

00:41:57.120 --> 00:41:58.880
 will not be used to--

00:41:58.880 --> 00:42:01.680
 - To fill the next born identity, right, okay.

00:42:01.680 --> 00:42:04.680
 - It means that you can see like photosynthesis

00:42:04.680 --> 00:42:06.240
 happening in real time.

00:42:06.240 --> 00:42:07.800
 - Hang on, are you saying it also won't be used

00:42:07.800 --> 00:42:09.600
 to give lots of insects performance reviews?

00:42:09.600 --> 00:42:10.440
 (laughing)

00:42:10.440 --> 00:42:11.280
 - None of that.

00:42:11.280 --> 00:42:12.200
 - What is the point then?

00:42:12.200 --> 00:42:14.640
 I don't need to see photosynthesis happening in real time.

00:42:14.640 --> 00:42:15.800
 I'm sure it's really useful.

00:42:15.800 --> 00:42:18.200
 - Well, Anne-Louis Lié said that basic research

00:42:18.200 --> 00:42:19.840
 is very important because you never know

00:42:19.840 --> 00:42:22.800
 what applications will be found in 50 years' time.

00:42:22.800 --> 00:42:23.840
 We don't know what they'll be,

00:42:23.840 --> 00:42:26.000
 but something, this kind of technology

00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:28.320
 will change our lives, but we don't know how yet.

00:42:28.320 --> 00:42:30.480
 - We'll be kicking ourselves when the ninth born film

00:42:30.480 --> 00:42:31.960
 is filmed using this method,

00:42:31.960 --> 00:42:34.480
 and you can see him punch the guy as it happens,

00:42:34.480 --> 00:42:37.480
 rather than slightly after it happens.

00:42:37.480 --> 00:42:41.360
 - But can we address the heated debate on nano?

00:42:41.360 --> 00:42:42.920
 - Oh yeah, I'm sure. - Oh, great.

00:42:42.920 --> 00:42:44.920
 - Yeah, so this is nano technology.

00:42:44.920 --> 00:42:47.400
 This was also written in the birth of nano technology.

00:42:47.400 --> 00:42:49.200
 How do you spell it?

00:42:49.200 --> 00:42:51.440
 - N-A-N-O, no, no.

00:42:51.440 --> 00:42:55.120
 - Sometimes yes, and sometimes no.

00:42:55.120 --> 00:42:57.880
 - Oh my God, I got really into this etymology.

00:42:57.880 --> 00:42:59.600
 - Sometimes no, and sometimes nah.

00:42:59.600 --> 00:43:01.200
 (laughing)

00:43:01.200 --> 00:43:04.520
 - So it first appeared in biology as nano with a double N,

00:43:04.520 --> 00:43:06.520
 1909, this is niche stuff.

00:43:06.520 --> 00:43:08.440
 - I've never seen it spelled with double N.

00:43:08.440 --> 00:43:10.160
 - N-A-N-N-O. - Yes.

00:43:10.160 --> 00:43:12.560
 - Or N-N-A-N-O, no, no.

00:43:12.560 --> 00:43:13.520
 (laughing)

00:43:13.520 --> 00:43:14.920
 - I think you know the answer to that question.

00:43:14.920 --> 00:43:16.120
 - All right.

00:43:16.120 --> 00:43:17.440
 - So the reason you haven't seen it

00:43:17.440 --> 00:43:18.800
 is 'cause it was used in zoology,

00:43:18.800 --> 00:43:22.200
 and it was in biology, it is used with a double N.

00:43:22.200 --> 00:43:24.600
 It's much rarer in biology, and it just meant very small,

00:43:24.600 --> 00:43:28.160
 and it's 'cause nano in Greek meant dwarf.

00:43:28.160 --> 00:43:30.680
 So nano bacteria, nano plankton,

00:43:30.680 --> 00:43:33.440
 that it just became a tiny thing to mean tiny.

00:43:33.440 --> 00:43:36.280
 Then physics took it on, but there's a rule in physics,

00:43:36.280 --> 00:43:38.720
 which I didn't know about, which is very niche,

00:43:38.720 --> 00:43:41.680
 but very exciting, which is that

00:43:41.680 --> 00:43:44.480
 if something is a multiple of something,

00:43:44.480 --> 00:43:46.040
 so let's say you've got a meter,

00:43:46.040 --> 00:43:48.920
 if you're saying a thousand meters, what's that?

00:43:48.920 --> 00:43:50.560
 - Kilometer. - A kilometer.

00:43:50.560 --> 00:43:53.400
 And that, you use the Greek, so kilometer,

00:43:53.400 --> 00:43:54.720
 kilo is from Greek. - Okay.

00:43:54.720 --> 00:43:57.040
 - If it's a submultiple, a factor,

00:43:57.040 --> 00:43:59.880
 like a thousandth of a meter, what do we say?

00:43:59.880 --> 00:44:00.840
 - Millie.

00:44:00.840 --> 00:44:02.280
 - Because if it's a submultiple,

00:44:02.280 --> 00:44:04.640
 exactly we use the Latin. - What?

00:44:04.640 --> 00:44:07.880
 - So they shouldn't have used the double N in nano

00:44:07.880 --> 00:44:10.600
 because that was the Greek. - Oh my God.

00:44:10.600 --> 00:44:14.880
 - Whereas the Latin for dwarf uses a single N, nanos,

00:44:14.880 --> 00:44:19.000
 and so the physicists who were adhering to convention

00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:21.120
 changed it to a single N.

00:44:21.120 --> 00:44:24.040
 Aren't you delighted? - There is no other podcast

00:44:24.040 --> 00:44:25.960
 is blowing shit wide open like this.

00:44:25.960 --> 00:44:27.840
 - Anna, I'm so sorry, I actually heard that fact

00:44:27.840 --> 00:44:29.400
 on Shagged Married Anoid last week.

00:44:29.400 --> 00:44:32.720
 (all laughing)

00:44:32.720 --> 00:44:34.240
 But it was Shagged Married Anoid

00:44:34.240 --> 00:44:36.480
 with only one N, because...

00:44:36.480 --> 00:44:39.480
 - That'll be my spin-off.

00:44:39.480 --> 00:44:41.720
 - Shagged Married Anoid, the batteries podcast.

00:44:41.720 --> 00:44:43.480
 - Yeah. - Beautiful, that's your spin-off.

00:44:43.480 --> 00:44:45.320
 - There we go. - Shagged Married Anoid,

00:44:45.320 --> 00:44:47.400
 which is mine about my sinus problems.

00:44:47.400 --> 00:44:49.640
 (all laughing)

00:44:49.640 --> 00:44:52.160
 - Shagged Married Anoid, for Dan.

00:44:52.160 --> 00:44:54.360
 - Oh no, that's mean.

00:44:54.360 --> 00:44:57.240
 - You're lucky, I don't know what that word means.

00:44:57.240 --> 00:44:59.360
 It's another word for wife guy.

00:44:59.360 --> 00:45:01.440
 - That's it, okay.

00:45:01.440 --> 00:45:04.400
 - Shagged Married, really happy, love my wife.

00:45:04.400 --> 00:45:07.080
 (all laughing)

00:45:07.080 --> 00:45:08.840
 - Make love, marriage.

00:45:08.840 --> 00:45:12.280
 (all laughing)

00:45:12.280 --> 00:45:14.240
 - Marry, then make love.

00:45:14.240 --> 00:45:16.600
 (all laughing)

00:45:16.600 --> 00:45:19.180
 (upbeat music)

00:45:19.180 --> 00:45:25.000
 - Okay, it is time for a final fact of the show,

00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:26.240
 and that is my fact.

00:45:26.240 --> 00:45:28.200
 My fact this week is that right

00:45:28.200 --> 00:45:30.480
 at the southernmost point of Sweden,

00:45:30.480 --> 00:45:34.440
 you will find a statue of Umar Thurman's naked granny.

00:45:34.440 --> 00:45:38.200
 - I'm gonna say, as a guess,

00:45:38.200 --> 00:45:41.280
 that it will not be her when she was a granny.

00:45:41.280 --> 00:45:44.040
 It might have been her in earlier life.

00:45:44.040 --> 00:45:48.040
 - Yeah, you would say that in the correct way, yes.

00:45:48.040 --> 00:45:48.880
 (all laughing)

00:45:48.880 --> 00:45:49.720
 - I'm like that.

00:45:49.720 --> 00:45:52.240
 (all laughing)

00:45:52.240 --> 00:45:53.520
 - Yeah, she was a model.

00:45:53.520 --> 00:45:56.640
 Her grandmother was a model called Birgit Holmquist,

00:45:56.640 --> 00:45:59.640
 and the sculptor, who wanted to make the statue,

00:45:59.640 --> 00:46:00.880
 hired her as a model,

00:46:00.880 --> 00:46:04.640
 and it's positioned right on this little seaside port

00:46:04.640 --> 00:46:08.280
 in this town, which is called Smigahuk, outside of--

00:46:08.280 --> 00:46:09.120
 - Trellarborgs.

00:46:09.120 --> 00:46:10.520
 - Outside of Trellarborgs.

00:46:10.520 --> 00:46:11.360
 - Yeah.

00:46:11.360 --> 00:46:12.680
 - Is it more, is basically,

00:46:12.680 --> 00:46:15.200
 if you go past the new granny statue,

00:46:15.200 --> 00:46:16.160
 you are leaving Sweden.

00:46:16.160 --> 00:46:17.480
 - No, I don't, I'm not sure it's--

00:46:17.480 --> 00:46:18.960
 - It's a nice statue.

00:46:18.960 --> 00:46:20.560
 - It's a beautiful statue, you know.

00:46:20.560 --> 00:46:21.680
 - Is it full naked?

00:46:21.680 --> 00:46:22.520
 - She has, yeah.

00:46:22.520 --> 00:46:23.680
 - No fig leaf or anything?

00:46:23.680 --> 00:46:24.520
 - Nope.

00:46:24.520 --> 00:46:25.360
 - Good on it.

00:46:25.360 --> 00:46:26.200
 - No, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:46:26.200 --> 00:46:27.440
 - Okay, wow.

00:46:27.440 --> 00:46:29.360
 Do we know anything else about this woman?

00:46:29.360 --> 00:46:31.760
 Did the statues all over the world of her,

00:46:31.760 --> 00:46:33.960
 or was she just that and then gone?

00:46:33.960 --> 00:46:36.120
 - No, I mean, you know, she was a model,

00:46:36.120 --> 00:46:38.080
 but really the Thurman family,

00:46:38.080 --> 00:46:39.760
 like they're all such fascinating people.

00:46:39.760 --> 00:46:41.480
 - I reckon it started with these guys.

00:46:41.480 --> 00:46:42.320
 - Yeah.

00:46:42.320 --> 00:46:44.680
 - So she was a great Swedish beauty,

00:46:44.680 --> 00:46:47.040
 but not from like an extremely rich family

00:46:47.040 --> 00:46:48.280
 or anything like that.

00:46:48.280 --> 00:46:51.640
 But she married a Westphalian baron

00:46:51.640 --> 00:46:54.200
 called Karl von Schläbrugge.

00:46:54.200 --> 00:46:55.040
 - Lovely.

00:46:55.040 --> 00:46:58.000
 - And Karl von Schläbrugge had a monocle.

00:46:58.000 --> 00:46:58.840
 He was a baron.

00:46:58.840 --> 00:46:59.680
 - Of course he did.

00:46:59.680 --> 00:47:02.080
 - He was briefly jailed by the Nazis

00:47:02.080 --> 00:47:04.920
 for refusing to denounce his business partners

00:47:04.920 --> 00:47:09.080
 who were Jewish and Bridget used her Swedish nationality

00:47:09.080 --> 00:47:11.280
 to kind of say, oh, look, he's Swedish as well.

00:47:11.280 --> 00:47:12.120
 He needs to come out.

00:47:12.120 --> 00:47:12.960
 He needs to come out.

00:47:12.960 --> 00:47:14.560
 And they managed to get him out of prison.

00:47:14.560 --> 00:47:16.320
 And then they moved off to,

00:47:16.320 --> 00:47:18.160
 I think they went to Mexico or China

00:47:18.160 --> 00:47:19.680
 or something like that away from the war.

00:47:19.680 --> 00:47:20.520
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:47:20.520 --> 00:47:23.840
 - And yeah, that was basically the start of the dynasty.

00:47:23.840 --> 00:47:25.920
 - Basically they fled Nazi Germany

00:47:25.920 --> 00:47:28.560
 at what is now clearly the most socially acceptable time

00:47:28.560 --> 00:47:30.640
 and we've done that which is in the 1930s

00:47:30.640 --> 00:47:33.360
 rather than in 1945 halfway through.

00:47:33.360 --> 00:47:35.560
 I moved to Central South America at the, yeah, yeah.

00:47:35.560 --> 00:47:37.240
 - You've got to specify, don't you?

00:47:37.240 --> 00:47:39.120
 Oh, I moved to South America from Nazi Germany.

00:47:39.120 --> 00:47:39.960
 When?

00:47:39.960 --> 00:47:41.720
 (laughing)

00:47:41.720 --> 00:47:43.680
 - Because actually there was another German

00:47:43.680 --> 00:47:45.320
 living in Mexico at the same time

00:47:45.320 --> 00:47:48.760
 with a very, very similar name who was a Nazi spy.

00:47:48.760 --> 00:47:51.800
 And some people on the internet think it's the same person.

00:47:51.800 --> 00:47:53.440
 I'm pretty sure it isn't the same person.

00:47:53.440 --> 00:47:54.720
 - Von Schläbrugge's.

00:47:54.720 --> 00:47:56.800
 - I'm also pretty sure that Mexico isn't South America,

00:47:56.800 --> 00:47:58.760
 by the way, in case someone complains about it.

00:47:58.760 --> 00:47:59.840
 - Is Central America?

00:47:59.840 --> 00:48:01.120
 - No, it's North America.

00:48:01.120 --> 00:48:01.960
 - What?

00:48:01.960 --> 00:48:04.000
 (laughing)

00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:05.200
 Then what's Canada?

00:48:05.200 --> 00:48:07.960
 (laughing)

00:48:07.960 --> 00:48:09.880
 Sorry, great point, great point, great point, great point.

00:48:09.880 --> 00:48:11.120
 Sorry, sorry to all that.

00:48:11.120 --> 00:48:12.200
 Do we have listeners in Mexico?

00:48:12.200 --> 00:48:13.920
 I don't know, I don't think I've ever had an email

00:48:13.920 --> 00:48:14.760
 from anyone in Mexico.

00:48:14.760 --> 00:48:15.840
 - Okay, if you're in Mexico.

00:48:15.840 --> 00:48:16.680
 - Yeah, right in, absolutely.

00:48:16.680 --> 00:48:17.520
 - Right in, please.

00:48:17.520 --> 00:48:19.360
 - So, okay, that's the Schläbrugge's.

00:48:19.360 --> 00:48:22.080
 And then Uma Thurman's mum, so their daughter,

00:48:22.080 --> 00:48:24.640
 was Nina Von Schläbrugge.

00:48:24.640 --> 00:48:26.680
 And she was also a model

00:48:26.680 --> 00:48:27.520
 'cause she was very good looking.

00:48:27.520 --> 00:48:28.880
 'Cause she had monocle jeans.

00:48:28.880 --> 00:48:30.240
 - Monocle jeans.

00:48:30.240 --> 00:48:34.400
 And she was a model in Manhattan.

00:48:34.400 --> 00:48:37.600
 And she modeled for Dali, Salvador Dali, I think.

00:48:37.600 --> 00:48:39.520
 - Yeah, she was very old. - Yeah, she was wild, wasn't she?

00:48:39.520 --> 00:48:41.920
 She, as in the life that she led

00:48:41.920 --> 00:48:43.000
 and the names that come up,

00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:45.080
 so before she married her husband

00:48:45.080 --> 00:48:48.040
 that would lead to Uma and her brothers,

00:48:48.040 --> 00:48:50.320
 she was married very briefly to Timothy Leary,

00:48:50.320 --> 00:48:53.320
 who she was introduced to by Salvador Dali.

00:48:53.320 --> 00:48:55.280
 So Timothy Leary, for those who don't know him,

00:48:55.280 --> 00:48:58.720
 he led the big push for psychedelics and LSD

00:48:58.720 --> 00:49:01.880
 and counterculture in America in the '60s.

00:49:01.880 --> 00:49:03.120
 - Briefly was correct.

00:49:03.120 --> 00:49:03.960
 - Yeah.

00:49:03.960 --> 00:49:04.800
 - They were married very briefly.

00:49:04.800 --> 00:49:06.360
 They separated during the honeymoon.

00:49:06.360 --> 00:49:07.200
 - No.

00:49:07.200 --> 00:49:11.160
 - Leary said, we had time travel

00:49:11.160 --> 00:49:13.640
 through a few mythic incarnations,

00:49:13.640 --> 00:49:16.680
 played out magical dramas in panoramic realms.

00:49:16.680 --> 00:49:18.160
 Now we would have to rise

00:49:18.160 --> 00:49:22.200
 to that most complex human art, gentle separation.

00:49:22.200 --> 00:49:23.040
 - Right.

00:49:23.040 --> 00:49:24.400
 - Yeah, I'd leave him too, actually.

00:49:24.400 --> 00:49:26.600
 - So he's describing.

00:49:26.600 --> 00:49:29.480
 And she met her then next husband, Uma's dad,

00:49:29.480 --> 00:49:31.680
 while she was at a house trying to get Leary

00:49:31.680 --> 00:49:33.200
 to sign the divorce papers.

00:49:33.200 --> 00:49:34.720
 So he was there for other reasons,

00:49:34.720 --> 00:49:36.040
 trying to get Leary to do something.

00:49:36.040 --> 00:49:38.200
 - Well, I read that Robert Thurman,

00:49:38.200 --> 00:49:40.080
 who was Uma Thurman's dad, obviously,

00:49:40.080 --> 00:49:42.040
 was only present at that house

00:49:42.040 --> 00:49:44.680
 where Nina was trying to persuade him to sign the papers.

00:49:44.680 --> 00:49:45.840
 He was there trying to stop Leary

00:49:45.840 --> 00:49:47.720
 taking so many drugs.

00:49:47.720 --> 00:49:49.400
 - How did that go?

00:49:49.400 --> 00:49:50.240
 - I don't know.

00:49:50.240 --> 00:49:51.080
 Not very well.

00:49:51.080 --> 00:49:51.920
 - That's funny.

00:49:51.920 --> 00:49:53.240
 - Leary's the guy who coined the phrase,

00:49:53.240 --> 00:49:54.560
 "Soon in, turn on, drop out."

00:49:54.560 --> 00:49:55.400
 - That's right.

00:49:55.400 --> 00:49:57.720
 - So he's a big counter-culture guy.

00:49:57.720 --> 00:50:00.320
 But then Robert Thurman is even more interesting

00:50:00.320 --> 00:50:01.240
 than Timothy Leary.

00:50:01.240 --> 00:50:05.360
 He's kind of an Indiana Jones style scholar of Buddhism.

00:50:05.360 --> 00:50:07.240
 And he's very cool.

00:50:07.240 --> 00:50:09.520
 - He seems to be one of the people who made Buddhism cool

00:50:09.520 --> 00:50:11.280
 in the 20th century, really.

00:50:11.280 --> 00:50:15.520
 Kind of one of the leading popularizers of it in the US.

00:50:15.520 --> 00:50:19.800
 So he seemed to have a revelation in 1961

00:50:19.800 --> 00:50:21.760
 when he was changing a flat tire.

00:50:21.760 --> 00:50:26.760
 And he said the tire iron flicked up into his eye.

00:50:26.760 --> 00:50:29.800
 And he went into a coma for three days.

00:50:29.800 --> 00:50:31.440
 So I must have flicked up quite hard.

00:50:31.440 --> 00:50:33.160
 He woke up and he'd lost an eye.

00:50:33.160 --> 00:50:35.480
 But as he says, he lost one eye

00:50:35.480 --> 00:50:38.520
 but gained a thousand more as he pushed it.

00:50:38.520 --> 00:50:39.360
 - Oh, wow.

00:50:39.360 --> 00:50:40.200
 - And that's when he gave up.

00:50:40.200 --> 00:50:41.640
 - That's a botched surgery, isn't it?

00:50:41.640 --> 00:50:44.640
 (all laugh)

00:50:44.640 --> 00:50:45.480
 - Yeah.

00:50:45.480 --> 00:50:48.000
 I think the surgeon was on LSD at the time.

00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:50.320
 - Dr. Leary, not you.

00:50:50.320 --> 00:50:52.600
 (all laugh)

00:50:52.600 --> 00:50:54.240
 - I don't know, he was one of a playboy

00:50:54.240 --> 00:50:55.880
 and he gave up his old playboy lifestyle,

00:50:55.880 --> 00:50:57.280
 hitchhiked to India and thought,

00:50:57.280 --> 00:50:59.720
 "I really want to become a Buddhist monk."

00:50:59.720 --> 00:51:00.880
 - That's kind of what the Buddha did though.

00:51:00.880 --> 00:51:03.040
 The Buddha was a sort of playboy prince, wasn't he?

00:51:03.040 --> 00:51:03.880
 - Yeah, that's right.

00:51:03.880 --> 00:51:06.960
 - But Thurman supposedly became the first American

00:51:06.960 --> 00:51:09.240
 to become officially a Buddhist monk.

00:51:09.240 --> 00:51:11.080
 Like to be recognized as one.

00:51:11.080 --> 00:51:11.920
 - Yeah.

00:51:11.920 --> 00:51:13.000
 - Do you know how long he lasted?

00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:13.980
 - How long?

00:51:13.980 --> 00:51:15.320
 - I think less than a year.

00:51:15.320 --> 00:51:16.400
 - Oh, God.

00:51:16.400 --> 00:51:17.920
 - He met this lama.

00:51:17.920 --> 00:51:20.000
 So he flew back from India to America,

00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:21.080
 met this lama and was like,

00:51:21.080 --> 00:51:22.560
 "I've been in India and I'm desperate

00:51:22.560 --> 00:51:23.400
 "to become a Buddhist monk.

00:51:23.400 --> 00:51:24.680
 "I'm going to be amazing at it."

00:51:24.680 --> 00:51:25.920
 The lama kept saying,

00:51:25.920 --> 00:51:27.040
 "I'm looking at your karma

00:51:27.040 --> 00:51:28.520
 "and you don't have monk in you.

00:51:28.520 --> 00:51:30.720
 "I promise you've got great things destined."

00:51:30.720 --> 00:51:31.960
 - You haven't got lama karma?

00:51:31.960 --> 00:51:35.040
 - Yeah, I haven't got lama karma, that's what he said.

00:51:35.040 --> 00:51:37.040
 But Robert kept on saying,

00:51:37.040 --> 00:51:38.080
 "No, I really want to do it."

00:51:38.080 --> 00:51:41.160
 So eventually the lama took him to meet the Dalai lama,

00:51:41.160 --> 00:51:43.080
 the big lama, as he's otherwise known.

00:51:43.080 --> 00:51:43.920
 - Boss lama.

00:51:43.920 --> 00:51:45.760
 - Boss lama, yeah, boss level,

00:51:45.760 --> 00:51:47.240
 who did ordain him as a monk

00:51:47.240 --> 00:51:49.720
 and literally within 18 months, he resigned.

00:51:49.720 --> 00:51:50.760
 - Why, why?

00:51:50.760 --> 00:51:53.600
 - The monk lifestyle he decided wasn't for him.

00:51:53.600 --> 00:51:55.080
 - Yeah, he's still leading.

00:51:55.080 --> 00:51:55.920
 He's still massive.

00:51:55.920 --> 00:51:56.760
 - He's still leading the movement.

00:51:56.760 --> 00:51:57.680
 The Dalai Lama was very like,

00:51:57.680 --> 00:51:59.280
 "Yeah, cool, good move, mate."

00:51:59.280 --> 00:52:00.440
 - The best mate, yes.

00:52:00.440 --> 00:52:02.400
 He and the Dalai Lama are very close

00:52:02.400 --> 00:52:04.280
 and he's the president of Tibet House US,

00:52:04.280 --> 00:52:06.960
 which is the main Tibetan organization in the USA.

00:52:06.960 --> 00:52:08.920
 So they've a bet with each other

00:52:08.920 --> 00:52:12.320
 to see if they can both live until the year 2048.

00:52:12.320 --> 00:52:14.280
 - Or it's getting closer.

00:52:14.280 --> 00:52:16.760
 Do you know how old that would make them both?

00:52:16.760 --> 00:52:17.760
 'Cause I think he's in--

00:52:17.760 --> 00:52:19.320
 - Robert Thurman is in his 80s.

00:52:19.320 --> 00:52:22.880
 - One of them will be 107, I think, maybe Thurman.

00:52:22.880 --> 00:52:23.720
 - That was interesting.

00:52:23.720 --> 00:52:24.560
 - Is it what happened?

00:52:24.560 --> 00:52:27.160
 They said, "Are you gonna live until this date?"

00:52:27.160 --> 00:52:28.000
 And he said, "Yeah."

00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:29.600
 And he said, "Want Tibet?"

00:52:29.600 --> 00:52:30.760
 And he said, "Yes, I do."

00:52:30.760 --> 00:52:32.560
 And then Xi Jinping said, "Well done."

00:52:32.560 --> 00:52:35.720
 - That is too good.

00:52:35.720 --> 00:52:37.240
 - Uma Thurman sounds like the least interesting

00:52:37.240 --> 00:52:38.160
 member of her own family.

00:52:38.160 --> 00:52:39.880
 I'd presume she was a relatively interesting person,

00:52:39.880 --> 00:52:41.920
 but all these antecedents are so interesting.

00:52:41.920 --> 00:52:43.160
 - Yeah, they're awesome.

00:52:43.160 --> 00:52:44.960
 So James, just on the topic of Uma Thurman,

00:52:44.960 --> 00:52:49.960
 you have been watching her entire output of movies, right?

00:52:49.960 --> 00:52:52.320
 - I've started, yeah.

00:52:52.320 --> 00:52:53.720
 But I only started two days ago,

00:52:53.720 --> 00:52:55.520
 so I've watched "Kill Bill One" and "Kill Bill Two."

00:52:55.520 --> 00:52:56.360
 - Right.

00:52:56.360 --> 00:52:58.720
 - Has any of you seen "Even Cowgirls Get the Blues?"

00:52:58.720 --> 00:52:59.560
 - No.

00:52:59.560 --> 00:53:00.680
 - Oh, I think that's, I mean,

00:53:00.680 --> 00:53:02.200
 it's based on an amazing book.

00:53:02.200 --> 00:53:03.480
 - Have you read it?

00:53:03.480 --> 00:53:05.000
 - No, no, I have it at home.

00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:06.360
 - It's the kind of book you would have read, actually.

00:53:06.360 --> 00:53:07.440
 - Yeah, "Tom Robbins."

00:53:07.440 --> 00:53:08.520
 - Yeah, very good, very good.

00:53:08.520 --> 00:53:10.480
 No, it's probably in a very bad film.

00:53:10.480 --> 00:53:12.320
 But I just love the concept.

00:53:12.320 --> 00:53:14.920
 It's just about a woman with unusually long thumbs.

00:53:14.920 --> 00:53:18.320
 And so it's called "Even Cowgirls Get the Blues."

00:53:18.320 --> 00:53:19.760
 - But it's an Uma Thurman film, sorry.

00:53:19.760 --> 00:53:20.600
 - It's an Uma Thurman film.

00:53:20.600 --> 00:53:23.200
 She plays this girl with very long thumbs.

00:53:23.200 --> 00:53:24.040
 - That's interesting.

00:53:24.040 --> 00:53:26.120
 She doesn't have long thumbs in real life, I don't think.

00:53:26.120 --> 00:53:28.600
 - So I think she might have had to wear prosthetic thumbs.

00:53:28.600 --> 00:53:29.440
 No, she doesn't have...

00:53:29.440 --> 00:53:30.280
 - She has big feet, doesn't she?

00:53:30.280 --> 00:53:31.120
 - She's got massive feet.

00:53:31.120 --> 00:53:33.840
 - Yeah, that's why she's in all of...

00:53:33.840 --> 00:53:34.680
 What's his name?

00:53:34.680 --> 00:53:35.520
 Who does those films?

00:53:35.520 --> 00:53:36.360
 - Tarantino.

00:53:36.360 --> 00:53:37.200
 - Tarantino.

00:53:37.200 --> 00:53:39.200
 Yeah, because he likes feet, doesn't he?

00:53:39.200 --> 00:53:40.040
 - Does he?

00:53:40.040 --> 00:53:40.880
 - I think so.

00:53:40.880 --> 00:53:41.720
 - Because there's lots of shots of her feet

00:53:41.720 --> 00:53:43.080
 in these two movies, I can say that.

00:53:43.080 --> 00:53:45.840
 She has size 11 feet, and that's American.

00:53:45.840 --> 00:53:47.160
 - What's that in old money?

00:53:47.160 --> 00:53:50.120
 - 12, I don't know, 10.

00:53:50.120 --> 00:53:51.440
 - Yeah, it's one either side.

00:53:51.440 --> 00:53:52.280
 - Yeah, it's one either side.

00:53:52.280 --> 00:53:53.120
 - Well, that's big either way.

00:53:53.120 --> 00:53:53.960
 - I don't know if it's that.

00:53:53.960 --> 00:53:54.800
 - That's very big, I agree.

00:53:54.800 --> 00:53:55.620
 - Thank you.

00:53:55.620 --> 00:53:56.760
 - She can't have size 12 feet.

00:53:56.760 --> 00:53:57.640
 - No, it's gotta be 10.

00:53:57.640 --> 00:53:59.160
 - But 10 would be very big.

00:53:59.160 --> 00:54:00.760
 It's still a good fact.

00:54:00.760 --> 00:54:02.280
 - You don't need to write it and tell us, by the way,

00:54:02.280 --> 00:54:03.920
 we will have been able to Google the conversions

00:54:03.920 --> 00:54:04.760
 after this one.

00:54:04.760 --> 00:54:07.040
 - Oh no, do not write it, please don't waste your time.

00:54:07.040 --> 00:54:08.640
 - I don't wanna wake up to 15 emails

00:54:08.640 --> 00:54:10.960
 about all subject like Uma Thurman feet pics.

00:54:10.960 --> 00:54:13.240
 - I don't want that, if you're in Mexico,

00:54:13.240 --> 00:54:15.520
 then tell us what size 10 is in your country.

00:54:15.520 --> 00:54:16.840
 (laughing)

00:54:16.840 --> 00:54:19.320
 - And also, which America are you really in?

00:54:19.320 --> 00:54:21.200
 (laughing)

00:54:21.200 --> 00:54:23.720
 - Oh dear, do you wanna hear about

00:54:23.720 --> 00:54:26.160
 another very attractive Swedish woman

00:54:26.160 --> 00:54:27.560
 who was turned into a statue?

00:54:27.560 --> 00:54:28.400
 - Okay, okay.

00:54:28.400 --> 00:54:29.480
 - Well, not turned into, the model for.

00:54:29.480 --> 00:54:30.560
 - Can we guess?

00:54:30.560 --> 00:54:31.400
 - Absolutely not.

00:54:31.400 --> 00:54:32.320
 - Brigitte Bardot.

00:54:32.320 --> 00:54:34.000
 - No, she's not a famous one.

00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:35.000
 - Ulrika Johnson.

00:54:35.000 --> 00:54:37.760
 - She's still quite famous, I'd say.

00:54:37.760 --> 00:54:38.600
 - Oh yeah.

00:54:38.600 --> 00:54:39.440
 - Do you feel like you're not being listened to, Andy?

00:54:39.440 --> 00:54:40.720
 - No, no, no, no, no, no.

00:54:40.720 --> 00:54:43.080
 This is Pitt Karin Err's daughter, okay?

00:54:43.080 --> 00:54:43.920
 - Oh.

00:54:43.920 --> 00:54:47.640
 - She was a Swedish young woman.

00:54:47.640 --> 00:54:49.480
 She was incredibly beautiful.

00:54:49.480 --> 00:54:50.880
 She's just, the whole story about her is just,

00:54:50.880 --> 00:54:52.360
 there was this, she was a milkmaid.

00:54:52.360 --> 00:54:55.360
 And the whole story is basically, she was just so fit.

00:54:55.360 --> 00:54:57.920
 So she went to Stockholm to work for a year.

00:54:57.920 --> 00:54:59.960
 And basically, no one could believe

00:54:59.960 --> 00:55:01.240
 how attractive this milkmaid was.

00:55:01.240 --> 00:55:04.120
 - And the bar is high in Sweden as well, don't you get?

00:55:04.120 --> 00:55:07.120
 That's not like being the most attractive person in (beep)

00:55:07.120 --> 00:55:07.960
 - Wow.

00:55:07.960 --> 00:55:11.120
 - So why would you name, leave that place out.

00:55:11.120 --> 00:55:12.960
 Leave that place name out.

00:55:12.960 --> 00:55:15.640
 - That was, bleep it out, no one will ever know

00:55:15.640 --> 00:55:17.120
 the place name that I have there.

00:55:17.120 --> 00:55:18.480
 Sorry, she was the most attractive person in Stockholm.

00:55:18.480 --> 00:55:21.200
 - So she was just so fit, basically.

00:55:21.200 --> 00:55:23.320
 - We get it, we get it, she's hot.

00:55:23.320 --> 00:55:26.720
 - But the stories are like the Crown Prince visitor

00:55:26.720 --> 00:55:28.880
 incognito to ask for some milk,

00:55:28.880 --> 00:55:30.880
 because he just wanted to look at this milkmaid.

00:55:30.880 --> 00:55:33.000
 And he forgot to bring a container.

00:55:33.000 --> 00:55:35.080
 So she gave him a sort of scolding.

00:55:35.080 --> 00:55:36.760
 - With hot milk?

00:55:36.760 --> 00:55:37.840
 - Not a scolding, sorry.

00:55:37.840 --> 00:55:39.160
 - A scolding.

00:55:39.160 --> 00:55:43.800
 - She created traffic jams, cause she was so beautiful.

00:55:43.800 --> 00:55:46.080
 People was doing a go slow as they went past.

00:55:46.080 --> 00:55:49.600
 - Or was that just James not moving with his horse and cart?

00:55:49.600 --> 00:55:50.440
 - Yeah.

00:55:50.440 --> 00:55:52.400
 And there's a statue of her in Sweden now.

00:55:52.400 --> 00:55:54.640
 And I think part of the reason she was apparently so beautiful

00:55:54.640 --> 00:55:57.000
 was that she hadn't had some more pox.

00:55:57.000 --> 00:55:58.640
 - Oh, okay.

00:55:58.640 --> 00:56:00.120
 - So the bar was slightly lower.

00:56:00.120 --> 00:56:02.440
 - Yes, she had had cow pox.

00:56:02.440 --> 00:56:05.480
 And she was accused actually of having sold more

00:56:05.480 --> 00:56:08.680
 than just milk, you know what I mean?

00:56:08.680 --> 00:56:10.200
 But that was real trick, trick.

00:56:10.200 --> 00:56:11.960
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:56:11.960 --> 00:56:13.080
 - Milkshake.

00:56:13.080 --> 00:56:16.320
 - Actually, she hadn't been selling any,

00:56:16.320 --> 00:56:17.160
 she hadn't been-

00:56:17.160 --> 00:56:18.000
 - Any of her milkshake?

00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:19.440
 - Right, yeah, she'd been selling milk

00:56:19.440 --> 00:56:20.280
 and she was just accused.

00:56:20.280 --> 00:56:22.240
 - Her milkshake brought the king to the yard.

00:56:22.240 --> 00:56:23.240
 - Yeah.

00:56:23.240 --> 00:56:25.680
 - And he's like, "Oh, do you have a spare bowl?"

00:56:25.680 --> 00:56:27.680
 (laughing)

00:56:27.680 --> 00:56:30.120
 - What's the most famous statue in Scandinavia?

00:56:30.120 --> 00:56:32.480
 - Do you have the answer?

00:56:32.480 --> 00:56:33.320
 - Yeah.

00:56:33.320 --> 00:56:35.040
 - The Copenhagen mermaid?

00:56:35.040 --> 00:56:36.720
 - The little mermaid, yeah.

00:56:36.720 --> 00:56:39.560
 Probably an advert for Carlsberg.

00:56:39.560 --> 00:56:40.400
 - Oh, no.

00:56:40.400 --> 00:56:41.520
 - Yeah.

00:56:41.520 --> 00:56:44.240
 It was commissioned by the founder of Carlsberg,

00:56:44.240 --> 00:56:46.200
 Jacob Christian Carlsberg.

00:56:46.200 --> 00:56:48.800
 And he basically said,

00:56:48.800 --> 00:56:50.840
 "Well, you know, I've got the best beer in the country,

00:56:50.840 --> 00:56:53.280
 so I'm gonna do this nice little statue

00:56:53.280 --> 00:56:54.800
 for everyone to see.

00:56:54.800 --> 00:56:56.680
 And when they see it, they'll remember me

00:56:56.680 --> 00:56:58.000
 and remember my beer."

00:56:58.000 --> 00:57:00.360
 - Oh dear, that's fucked up, isn't it?

00:57:00.360 --> 00:57:03.040
 Because one of those adverts, which is very memorable,

00:57:03.040 --> 00:57:05.160
 that you've got no idea what it was for.

00:57:05.160 --> 00:57:06.000
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:08.440
 It's probably the best mermaid statue in the world.

00:57:08.440 --> 00:57:09.760
 - Nice. - Very good.

00:57:09.760 --> 00:57:12.920
 He hired a sculpture called Edvard Ericsson to create it.

00:57:12.920 --> 00:57:15.320
 And he hired a ballerina called Ellen Price,

00:57:15.320 --> 00:57:17.360
 who is very, very famous in Sweden

00:57:17.360 --> 00:57:18.920
 at the time to model for it.

00:57:18.920 --> 00:57:21.280
 But she was unwilling to get naked.

00:57:21.280 --> 00:57:22.600
 And so the face is hers

00:57:22.600 --> 00:57:25.400
 and the body is Mr. Ericsson's wife.

00:57:25.400 --> 00:57:26.240
 - Really?

00:57:26.240 --> 00:57:28.040
 - Wow, what about the tail?

00:57:28.040 --> 00:57:30.880
 (laughing)

00:57:30.880 --> 00:57:31.720
 - No, that's his wife.

00:57:31.720 --> 00:57:32.560
 - That's his wife.

00:57:32.560 --> 00:57:35.080
 (laughing)

00:57:35.080 --> 00:57:37.280
 - I've just got one more celebrity grandparent fact.

00:57:37.280 --> 00:57:38.120
 - Oh yeah.

00:57:38.120 --> 00:57:41.880
 - Drew Barrymore's grandfather's corpse was stolen.

00:57:41.880 --> 00:57:45.240
 So this is John Barrymore, who was a very famous actor.

00:57:45.240 --> 00:57:48.080
 In the, he was the, John's 1922 hamlet,

00:57:48.080 --> 00:57:50.560
 which you probably remember was the greatest hamlet

00:57:50.560 --> 00:57:51.400
 maybe ever.

00:57:51.400 --> 00:57:52.720
 - Yeah, that was a good one.

00:57:52.720 --> 00:57:55.240
 - It really was, he was a famous actor.

00:57:55.240 --> 00:57:57.760
 He was ruined by alcoholism and died in 1942,

00:57:57.760 --> 00:57:58.880
 relatively young.

00:57:58.880 --> 00:58:00.520
 His mates were people like Errol Flynn.

00:58:00.520 --> 00:58:02.140
 And Errol Flynn wrote in his memoir

00:58:02.140 --> 00:58:04.800
 that after Barrymore died,

00:58:04.800 --> 00:58:08.440
 their friend got his body, obtained his body

00:58:08.440 --> 00:58:11.680
 and hid it for Errol Flynn to find to freak him out.

00:58:11.680 --> 00:58:13.120
 So propped him up in a chair

00:58:13.120 --> 00:58:15.160
 and then they spent the night playing poker with it.

00:58:15.160 --> 00:58:17.160
 - Is that what we can the Bernys is based on?

00:58:17.160 --> 00:58:19.160
 - Do you know what, I think largely it is.

00:58:19.160 --> 00:58:20.800
 Cause it was, it was not only Errol Flynn,

00:58:20.800 --> 00:58:22.080
 it was David Nevin.

00:58:22.080 --> 00:58:23.840
 And I want to say Orson Welles,

00:58:23.840 --> 00:58:25.880
 someone in that territory of fame.

00:58:25.880 --> 00:58:26.720
 - There was a group of them.

00:58:26.720 --> 00:58:27.560
 - There was a group of them.

00:58:27.560 --> 00:58:29.160
 - I think it is because I haven't really heard

00:58:29.160 --> 00:58:32.360
 of any of those people and I've never seen Weekend at Bernys.

00:58:32.360 --> 00:58:33.880
 I'm not really sure what happens in it,

00:58:33.880 --> 00:58:36.000
 but I still kind of knew that fact.

00:58:36.000 --> 00:58:38.440
 - Wait, so it's Weekend at Bernys about them playing.

00:58:38.440 --> 00:58:39.600
 - I think it's about a dead body.

00:58:39.600 --> 00:58:40.680
 - Keeping a dead body.

00:58:40.680 --> 00:58:44.720
 - Their body dies and they need to keep a holiday going.

00:58:44.720 --> 00:58:47.720
 And so they string him up and they use his dead body.

00:58:47.720 --> 00:58:48.560
 Yeah.

00:58:48.560 --> 00:58:49.400
 - There we go.

00:58:49.400 --> 00:58:50.240
 That's sort of what they did,

00:58:50.240 --> 00:58:52.320
 except just to have a fun gamer poker with him.

00:58:52.320 --> 00:58:53.160
 - Wow.

00:58:53.160 --> 00:58:55.040
 - Confirmed by Drew Barrymore in 2020.

00:58:55.040 --> 00:58:55.880
 - That's right.

00:58:55.880 --> 00:58:56.720
 - Good Lord.

00:58:56.720 --> 00:58:57.560
 - Yeah, that's pretty cool.

00:58:57.560 --> 00:59:00.480
 - If I die, please don't do that.

00:59:00.480 --> 00:59:01.960
 Don't do another podcast.

00:59:01.960 --> 00:59:04.120
 - What do you want us to do with your dead body then?

00:59:04.120 --> 00:59:05.960
 Shall we, we could prop it up and do something fun,

00:59:05.960 --> 00:59:07.720
 prop it up and collect some moths with you.

00:59:07.720 --> 00:59:08.560
 - Yeah, lovely.

00:59:08.560 --> 00:59:09.400
 - Or the acid thing.

00:59:09.400 --> 00:59:10.240
 Let's just burn you.

00:59:10.240 --> 00:59:12.480
 (laughing)

00:59:12.480 --> 00:59:17.800
 - Wow, what a dark term this podcast took at the end.

00:59:17.800 --> 00:59:20.240
 - It's time to go to our group therapy session now.

00:59:20.240 --> 00:59:22.040
 And just shoot that over.

00:59:22.040 --> 00:59:26.620
