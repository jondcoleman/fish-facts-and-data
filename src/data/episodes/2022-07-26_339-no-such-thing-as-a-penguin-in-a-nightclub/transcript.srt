00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
 Hi everyone, welcome to this week's No Such Things as a Fish, where myself, Anna and Andy are joined by none other than Tom Scott.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:20,000
 Now, most of you will probably know who Tom Scott is, but for those of you who don't, he is a YouTuber who makes unbelievably interesting videos about the most incredible things from all around the world.

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:30,000
 His videos are right up our street. I know they'll be right up yours as well, so you should definitely check out his channel, which is youtube.com/tomscotgo.

4
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:40,000
 And actually, if you're looking for videos, you can always go to our channel, which I don't think we've mentioned very much, which you can find at qi.com/qitv, and that has a whole load of clips from Fish.

5
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:48,000
 Dan and I recently did a video for the Ig Nobel Prizes, which you can see on there. There's all sorts. You should definitely check that out.

6
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
 OK, on with the podcast.

7
00:00:50,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 [Music]

8
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:15,000
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Things as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming to you from four top secret locations around the United Kingdom.

9
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:23,000
 My name is Anna Tyshinski, and I'm sitting here today with Andrew Hunter Murray, James Harkin, and a very special guest, YouTuber Tom Scott.

10
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 And we are here to discuss our four favorite facts from the last seven days. So, in no particular order, here we go, starting with you, Tom.

11
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:42,000
 I wanted to make a YouTube video about how interesting strobe lighting is, but the likelihood was it would give one of my viewers an epileptic fit, so I've come on your podcast to talk about things then.

12
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
 Fair enough. So happy to serve.

13
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
 Can you give anyone an audio-epileptic fit? I don't watch it.

14
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:57,000
 Not to my knowledge, but there's definitely a thing about lights and strobe lights.

15
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:10,000
 So I was trying to work out how to demonstrate this without demonstrating it and without giving instructions, because statistically, one of my viewers was going to find out that they have photosensitive epilepsy the hard way, and I just couldn't figure out a way to tell it.

16
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:23,000
 So one of the really cool things about this is that it goes back a long, long way. There's a story that Nostradamus once received visions by closing his eyes and staring at the sun and waving his spread hand in front of his face.

17
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:31,000
 So he was getting flashes of the sun against his closed eyes at the right frequency. That's probably rubbish, but that's the oldest reference I could find.

18
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:41,000
 It feels like a not very cool chemical way of inducing hallucinations as well. That feels like kids rolling up non-drugs and smoking them and trying to get high off that.

19
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
 Like banana peels.

20
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:49,000
 So what did he report seeing Nostradamus when he flashed his hand in front of his face?

21
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:59,000
 The first reference I can find is sort of early 19th century and they got called strobescopic hallucinations. And basically you close your eyes, you flash a strobe light.

22
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:13,000
 So this could be something as simple as you've got your eyes closed looking out the window of your 19th century buggy as it goes along the road and you pass some railings and that sort of flashing light, dark, light, dark, light, dark against your eyelids is enough to induce this.

23
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:21,000
 Everyone sort of sees grids, urn fractal patterns and sort of weird 3D abstract shapes.

24
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:35,000
 So have you presumably done it and seen that? Because I was researching this yesterday and had a relatively severe hangover and I couldn't bring myself to attempt to do any of this because I was afraid I would vomit.

25
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
 But how intense is it really?

26
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:48,000
 So it depends on how intense the flashing is, which is kind of an obvious thing to say, but there's sort of basic version where you just get a strobe app on your phone and you point it at your eyes.

27
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:58,000
 After about 10, 15 seconds you'll start to see some sort of floating patterns, might be like you're rushing down a tunnel, might be like you're sort of travelling sideways, might just be some flashing grids, things like that.

28
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:07,000
 It tends to be red and blue, it appears. The first time I ever got to experience this was a device invented by a hacker called Mitch Altman.

29
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,000
 Now I don't know if you've heard of any of his stuff before, have you heard of the TV be gone?

30
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
 No, no.

31
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:23,000
 It's a little pocket sized device, fits on your keychain and he invented it sort of early 2000s I think and it sends every remote controls off code one after the other.

32
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:30,000
 So if you're in a bar and you want to turn off that TV in the corner, you just sort of point that and wait.

33
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:40,000
 There was a group of people called the White Dot organisation or something and they thought that no one should ever watch TV in pubs because it's anti-social.

34
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:48,000
 So they went round to all the pubs and they deliberately turned off all the TVs and it was while I was working in the pub industry and we were furious.

35
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:55,000
 It was on the front page of all the industry newspapers and stuff, it was a big story.

36
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:02,000
 Did they come into your pub and you'd have someone press a button and switch the TVs off or was it just the threat of them?

37
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:15,000
 I reckon they probably didn't do any of this stuff and it was probably like a big story in the local newspapers which never actually happened but it was definitely something that we told our landlords to keep an eye open for.

38
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:20,000
 Really? Because these things do work, don't they? And I kind of can't believe that they're sold.

39
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:26,000
 You can get one of the TV begones for about 30 quid and apparently it still sort of works.

40
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:32,000
 I think technology is moving beyond it but then it catches up. I don't know if you've tried it Tom, but I really want to say it.

41
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:44,000
 I actually owned one once because I like Mitch Altman, I want to support his stuff and I think I'll never use it a couple of times because it turns out that actually having this thing on your keychain is kind of annoying

42
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:52,000
 and it's quite a big thing. He actually built two versions. One smartphone came along, he built a super powered one that looks like a smartphone and works from a huge distance.

43
00:05:52,000 --> 00:06:02,000
 And you can find footage of someone taking that to a trade show and just irritating every single technology booth and it's not nice.

44
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:08,000
 That's just someone trolling. Does it work on traffic lights?

45
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:15,000
 No, sadly. Someone definitely invented that as well. That definitely exists. I think actively illegal.

46
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:23,000
 It's a brave person, I think, who enters a pub on the evening of the Champions League final when the TV began.

47
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,000
 I think I wouldn't be willing to risk it but it is pretty incredible.

48
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:33,000
 Did Mitch Altman also design the glasses you were talking about or the brain thing?

49
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:44,000
 I got to try one of Mitch Altman's brain machines which are just, they're kind of glasses, or at least the one I tried was just like paper glasses, the kind of thing you get for watching the clips or something like that.

50
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:54,000
 But with an LED in front of each eye, so you just close your eyes and it would flash the LEDs at roughly the right strobe frequency, about 12 hertz.

51
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:03,000
 He claimed they were at brainwave frequencies and they sort of matched to do sort of 15 minutes session over time, adapted your brainwaves to do something.

52
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:11,000
 I'm not convinced of that section of it, but yeah, like I saw a huge amount of patterns. It was really interesting to see.

53
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:21,000
 And then the bit above that, the most intense version of this that I've ever seen is an artwork called 'Z' by Kurt Henschlager, which I saw in Liverpool once.

54
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:31,000
 And it was a room filled so thick with theatrical smoke that you literally, if you stretched your hand out in front of your face, you couldn't see your hand.

55
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:40,000
 I have never been in fog that is thicker than that. And then just super powerful strobe lights going at 12 hertz in a pattern.

56
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:51,000
 I got told later that they were just pure white strobe lights. I thought they were red and blue and all sorts of colours. You saw all sorts of enormous patterns swirling around you.

57
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:59,000
 It felt, I don't know, like in some sort of star trek transporter beam, because there are just fractal patterns swirling around your hand.

58
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:08,000
 It is absolutely astonishing. But yeah, if you look up news articles about it, there are all sorts of things about, yeah, they decided to close it, gave 2% of the people who went into it an epileptic fit.

59
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:16,000
 It induced epileptic fits in people who had never had photosensitive epilepsy before. It was genuinely dangerous.

60
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:23,000
 It was also one of the most incredible visual experiences I've ever had, but I can see why it didn't tour as much as it perhaps should have.

61
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:30,000
 I mean, it sounds extremely unpleasant, I have to say. I don't think I'd want to subject myself to that, even without photosensitive epilepsy.

62
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:44,000
 I've got a question. Do you ever, in these experiences, get beyond seeing kind of fractal patterns and you start seeing, you know, dogs with nine legs or whatever? Does it ever get really crazy?

63
00:08:44,000 --> 00:09:02,000
 So while I was researching this, I found that this was part of the beat generation, where Alan Ginsburg tried a thing called the dream machine, which was a bulb and a record turntable with sort of slattered paper around it.

64
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:10,000
 So you just started the turntable going and it was calibrated to kind of hit your eyes at the right frequency, which is the brain machine just built for an entire room.

65
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:18,000
 I think that was that inspired by someone, was it Guy called Geisin, who was going on a car along a tree lined street and had the light flashing.

66
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:26,000
 So if you do want the cheap way, you can drive along a street of plain trees, I suppose, in the sun and lean out the window and close your eyes.

67
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,000
 That's really cool. I mean, you might want to do that as the passenger, but yes.

68
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:45,000
 Actually, that dream machine, when Geisin made it, he thought that it was going to replace the television set in every single home, which I've got to say, if there's no dogs with nine legs, and if it's just like fractal patterns, I don't know.

69
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:51,000
 I know there's some crap on TV at the moment, but I think you could you could do that because the visuals of TV shows, often they're not very interesting, actually.

70
00:09:51,000 --> 00:10:01,000
 There's just panels of it. Let's say Question Time. If you had the audio of Question Time and you've still got the content, but you were able to see magical fractal patterns throughout, I don't think people would not do that.

71
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:07,000
 No, that should be an option. You should be able to press the red button to get fractal patterns over Fiona Bruce.

72
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:17,000
 Yeah, I got a quote from Ginsburg. While I was researching this, it creates optical fields as religious and mandalic as hallucinogenic drugs.

73
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:22,000
 Although, didn't he also say that a combination of that and drugs was really best?

74
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:31,000
 Right, that's the thing. Like, all this does is create an optical illusion. It creates weird fractal patterns. I cannot find any sort of research as to why.

75
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:40,000
 It seems to just be a failure state for the vision system of the brain that we never dealt with, you know, 12-hurt strobe lights in nature, so brain just faults trying to do it.

76
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:45,000
 Do you know what the most common hallucination is in the world? I think. This is my theory.

77
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,000
 Is it like a mirage, maybe? Or is that not really a hallucination?

78
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
 It's not common. Yeah, I think we're close.

79
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:58,000
 No, that's external. No, I would say that's not a hallucination because your eyes are accurately reporting the white skin.

80
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
 Yeah, that's fair.

81
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
 Is it the dog with nine legs?

82
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
 Yeah, it's the dog with nine legs.

83
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
 Always nine.

84
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
 Why always nine?

85
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
 Five billion people have seen it.

86
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,000
 So I think it's the phantom phone ringing thing.

87
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:15,000
 It says when you are hallucinating or phone ringing. So phantom vibration syndrome. I looked it up a bit.

88
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,000
 It has a load of other names, more fun names. It gets called ringsiety.

89
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:23,000
 The faux alarm, like faux as in false in French, faux alarm.

90
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:29,000
 Wait a minute, wait a minute. The word false means faux anyway. So why do you need to include up the word faux?

91
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,000
 That's a really good point. Yeah, I can't. It seems cleverer than that.

92
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
 But isn't it faux alarm because faux sounds a bit more like phone?

93
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
 Faux alarm. It must be that, Andy.

94
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:43,000
 I mean, I've copied it down directly from the internet and it's just going fresh.

95
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:47,000
 I think we've invented a new name for it, the faux alarm, faux alarm.

96
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:55,000
 But it started off. The earliest reference I found, although I didn't look exhaustively, but it was referred to in Dilbert, the comic Dilbert in 1996.

97
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:00,000
 But back then it was called phantom pager syndrome because people thought their pagers were going off.

98
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:07,000
 And yeah, so apparently the only way to solve it would be to move your phone to a much more sensitive part of your body.

99
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:12,000
 Like if you keep it in your mouth, you'll always know whether it's ringing or not.

100
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:18,000
 Do you think, Andy, they ever had? I mean, that's very funny, but do you think?

101
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,000
 We've all got a joke we want to look at and we'll look at it to ourselves.

102
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
 So, although that does bring new meaning to the word dictaphone, so...

103
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
 There we go.

104
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
 There's the punchline.

105
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
 Phone to dictaphone.

106
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:38,000
 Did you think when you used to have pocket watches and you would keep it near your heart, that kind of thing, and it would tick?

107
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,000
 Do you think if you didn't have your pocket watch, you would have phantom pocket watch syndrome?

108
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
 I bet you did.

109
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
 But you can't feel it ticking against your heart, can you?

110
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
 You might be able to.

111
00:12:49,000 --> 00:13:00,000
 I mean, it's normally on the outside of a shirt and a waistcoat, I guess, if you're doing it properly, whereas if you're going commando and you're just wearing your pocket watch...

112
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
 Where are you attaching it?

113
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
 It's under my full skin. The pocket watch is under my full skin this way.

114
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
 Oh no.

115
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:13,000
 Have you got the time? Yes, but I'm not sure you're going to want to know.

116
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:26,000
 I read that the Roman novelist and orator Acleius, he said that the spinning of a potter's wheel could sometimes give people seizures, like almost in the same strobing way.

117
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
 Really? That's true. That's what he said.

118
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:32,000
 But if you get a wonky pot, maybe that's why.

119
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:38,000
 People are always kind of claiming that we've managed to hone this technology to become a military weapon, aren't they?

120
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:50,000
 When you research kind of flashing lights and strobe lights being able to have a weird impact on your brain, it's always like the US military is researching how to incapacitate the Russians with a flashing light.

121
00:13:50,000 --> 00:14:02,000
 And I can't really find any evidence that these things work, even though they're constantly tried, except last year it was reported that Russia had fitted two warships with this light, which I think flashes.

122
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:16,000
 And it induces hallucinations and vomiting, apparently. It's called the FP42 fill-in, and it's non-lethal, but it releases a strobe-like beam and apparently disrupts eyesight, which I would imagine you're just flashing something in someone's eyes.

123
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:21,000
 Yeah, of course it disrupts eyesight, but according to them, you can become delirious and throw up everywhere.

124
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:26,000
 Probably the fact they've just given you a lot of knobby-chock doesn't help either.

125
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:41,000
 The reason I started down this whole rabbit hole is that I got an email from a startup in Bristol that is trying to use EEG sort of brainwave reading kit, and then trying to synchronise the strobes with that kind of have a greater effect.

126
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:51,000
 They claim to be able to get altered states of consciousness with it. They claim to be able to get something higher than I'm just seeing some patterns.

127
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:59,000
 I'm sceptical because you can't really test that against placebo all that well. You can't test it against pretending to flash a light in someone's eyes.

128
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:08,000
 They are in very early studies, but they hope to be able to do something with it. I'm not sure what that something is, but I wish them the best of luck.

129
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:14,000
 I do find the placebo thing interesting. I only struck me recently how often you can't use a placebo because of things like that.

130
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:24,000
 You can't do a placebo effect of a flashing light, or I think they have problems with studies into how much exercise impacts health in certain ways because you can't do a placebo exercise.

131
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:29,000
 You can't convince someone that they have been for a run every day for a week if they've been sitting in front of the TV.

132
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:38,000
 Well, they also say you can't do a placebo of a parachute. You can't give one person a parachute and then give one person no parachute and see which one works.

133
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:53,000
 I think you could do a placebo of exercise though. Let's say you want to see what it's like for someone running five miles and the control group is you'll have to get them to run one mile, but they'll think it's five miles.

134
00:15:53,000 --> 00:16:02,000
 So you would put signposts all around their local park saying, "I'll keep going. You've nearly done five miles," and so on, and then by the time they get back, they'll have only run one mile.

135
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:08,000
 So that's a placebo. You'd have to get all the trees in the park sort of moving towards them so it looks to them like that.

136
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:13,000
 You'd have to create smaller trees maybe so they thought they were running past them faster. Maybe a revolving park.

137
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
 Small, everything really, small dogs.

138
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:24,000
 But then you sort of created a cohort of people that think they've got superhuman ability to run past and then they turn up at the Olympics and they're absolutely shit.

139
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:36,000
 Just on strobe lighting, it's possible that the neuralyzer from men in black might exist. Do you guys remember what that is?

140
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
 Yeah, it's a plus two memory.

141
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
 Exactly. You flash a light at someone.

142
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
 Yeah, but how would you know?

143
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:47,000
 Well, that's a big question. It might exist already and it's just that it's erased our memory of it every time it's been used.

144
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:58,000
 But scientists have now done some experiments sure on mice as usual, but it turns out that if the researchers kind of shocked mice on the foot when they went into a certain room,

145
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:04,000
 and then usually what would happen is the mouse would freeze as soon as it enters that room again because it expects to be shocked again.

146
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:11,000
 But they found that when they flashed a light in their eyes at a certain frequency, they'd completely forgotten the shock and they went back into the room.

147
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:20,000
 And so it seems like just by flashing a light in a certain way at people, then they think it interrupts connections between the nerves that are forming your memories.

148
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,000
 And so it blanks out your memory and it only blanks out about the previous four seconds.

149
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:31,000
 So it's just it's got to be something that's happened immediately before you flash the light in their eyes that you want them to forget.

150
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:37,000
 So it looks like we might be able to use strobe lighting in the same way they do in that film Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.

151
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:42,000
 Is that why whenever I've been to a nightclub I could never remember the next morning what happened?

152
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:47,000
 Exactly why it is. Yeah, just flash a torch in your face and it'll all come flooding back.

153
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:57,000
 OK, it is time for our second fact and that comes from Andy.

154
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:05,000
 My fact is that from the 1880s until 1927, Paris had an underground clock system which ran on puffs of air.

155
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:13,000
 So this is from an article on ParisianFields.com, brilliant website all about Paris and so various weird things that it's gotten it.

156
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:19,000
 So in 1880 Paris installed this series of clocks and they all kept the same time.

157
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:27,000
 So there were public clocks sort of there as a public good and each one of them was connected to an air pump.

158
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:34,000
 And those pumps were led to this wrought iron pipe system and all of that was fed from this power plant in the middle of Paris, this coal fired plant.

159
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:47,000
 And every minute that system would pump out a pulse of air which would get into the clock and it would activate the small bellows inside the clock and it would move the clock along by one minute.

160
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:56,000
 So that's how the system worked. Every minute it worked literally as regular as clockwork and you could subscribe if you liked.

161
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:05,000
 So some hotels signed up and they basically had a kind of subscription service to time on the basis of the system.

162
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:14,000
 And if you got a subscription service you were agreeing that they would dig a pipe in your floor running from your clock back to this pneumatic system.

163
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
 I mean, pretty much that's it.

164
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
 Wow, that is incredible.

165
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:28,000
 There was an article in Scientific American that said, OK, well, there will have to be a massive pipe in your house, but maybe you could paint it in the same colour as your wallpaper and no one will notice it.

166
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
 Lovely.

167
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:36,000
 But yeah, the Hotel Maurice, they had 148 of them in the building, didn't they?

168
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
 Jesus.

169
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:45,000
 Would some be a bit behind the other? Because presumably you pump a little puff of air out, but it takes longer to get to one on the outskirts of Paris. Does that mean they were a minute behind?

170
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:52,000
 I don't think it does. I think they probably adjusted for this because there were these various kind of holding stations along the way.

171
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:58,000
 So it wasn't like one puff had to get either to the first arrondissement or the 20th.

172
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:10,000
 There were a few that were a little bit out of sync. I think the further away you were from the station, the obviously the slightly further out it was, but there were enough of these stations that it didn't make that much difference.

173
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:18,000
 You say puffs of air, it was sort of 20 seconds on, 40 seconds off, so there was a cashing system in there that needed a big pump of air for a few seconds.

174
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:23,000
 That would advance the minute hand and then the next 40 seconds off would let that sort of calm down again.

175
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:31,000
 So it wasn't sort of precise to the second because nothing back then had to be precise to the second, but it was precise enough.

176
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:42,000
 And I wonder how often people use the excuse when they were late to meet friends for a café that, oh, I'm actually quite a long way from the air puffs, so it takes further to get to me.

177
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:51,000
 Well, I read in popular science that it was never allowed to exceed 10 seconds of error, so I think if you're 10 seconds late, I don't know.

178
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:55,000
 We all know those people are always five minutes late, but 10 seconds, I think.

179
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:59,000
 I'm furious. If anyone's more than nine seconds, I'm absolutely livid.

180
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:04,000
 Also, in Paris, 10 seconds late is 10 minutes early, isn't it? Let's be honest.

181
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:11,000
 Very true. Very chic. I kind of just kept going all the way through the First World War.

182
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:19,000
 You know, 1927 is when it lasted until, and in fact, the first time it broke down was in 1910, and it was because the air plant was flooded.

183
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:23,000
 There was a huge flood of the River Seine, and that was the thing they were always worried about.

184
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:30,000
 And the coal-fired plant temporarily had to be turned off and reset then, and then the clocks all stopped.

185
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
 And there were thousands all over the city by this point.

186
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:38,000
 It's such an awesome system. I don't understand why you'd ever decommission it, and it sounds like it was an enormous hassle to install.

187
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,000
 Because it's cheaper for us all to have a Casio on our wrists, I think.

188
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
 Yeah.

189
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
 I'm going to invest a pneumatic wristwatch.

190
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:51,000
 I'd love to see that. Basically, whenever you go into a room, you have to attach yourself to the massive pipe.

191
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
 Yeah.

192
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:59,000
 You could have a second set of bellows in your clocks, which would do a chime.

193
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:05,000
 So you would have one that would attach to the kind of the minute hand, and then you would be able to divert it off,

194
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,000
 and it would make a little ding-dong, ding-dong, like that.

195
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
 That's so cool.

196
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
 Yeah. That's nice.

197
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:19,000
 I did read, though, that there was a time when in France, in French railway stations at least, then clocks were set deliberately five minutes fast,

198
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:23,000
 so the travellers didn't miss their trains. I think that was a thing until about 1910 or '11.

199
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
 I think that's still a thing in Edinburgh, isn't it?

200
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
 I remember.

201
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
 Yes.

202
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
 Is that right?

203
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
 Yeah, the Balmoral Clock. Yeah.

204
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,000
 Has always been set three minutes fast.

205
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
 Isn't that -- it's on the Scotsman Hotel, right?

206
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
 It's on the Balmoral Hotel, I think.

207
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
 But yeah, just outside the station.

208
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

209
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:44,000
 So the people -- I think it's three minutes, and the only time that that one runs on time is for New Year.

210
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:50,000
 So I think they run three minutes fast all the time, and then they put it back for Hogmanay, so they're not ahead of everyone else.

211
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
 It's a clever trick. I always have my watches run fast.

212
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:56,000
 There is a really cool website I found, which is a website of stopped clocks.

213
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
 Oh, yeah.

214
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:04,000
 Yeah, it was created in 2007 by a guy called Alfie Denon, and it basically is for people to submit stopped clocks near them.

215
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,000
 You take a photo of your local public clock.

216
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:11,000
 It's not just that your clock has stopped working in your home.

217
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:15,000
 He doesn't want that, and it's so people can campaign to get them up and running again.

218
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:22,000
 Unfortunately, no one has posted on it since 2014, so the website itself has also stopped.

219
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
 That's amazing.

220
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,000
 I've been ranting about this for years.

221
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:32,000
 In London, I reckon over half of the clocks are stopped, and I've always thought if I took a sabbatical,

222
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:38,000
 I would use it to go around London and take a tally of exactly how many clocks are wrong and how many are right.

223
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:42,000
 I do think it's more than half, so Alfie Denon, you've got to get that website back up and running.

224
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
 It's a disgrace.

225
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
 Yeah, that would be great use of your time.

226
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
 I think so.

227
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:52,000
 Well, people used to sell the time, didn't they, which is such a weird concept.

228
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:56,000
 So when people wanted to know the time, there were only a few people in town who'd know it.

229
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:01,000
 The astronomer Royal would know it, and so he used to get very annoyed in the 19th century.

230
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:06,000
 It was John Belville, and I think we've talked about him before because people would knock on his door and say,

231
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,000
 "Hey, me, I hear you're an astronomer. Can you tell me what the time is?"

232
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:13,000
 Yeah, because it was Ruth Belville, who I'm sure we must have mentioned,

233
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:21,000
 but who at the same time as France had this amazing kind of system of blowing bits of air through to get the time,

234
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,000
 we had a lady called Ruth Belville who was walking around London saying,

235
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,000
 "Do you want to know the time? Do you want to know the time?"

236
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:31,000
 And people would pay her because she would, at the start of each day,

237
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,000
 she would go and set her pocket watch with the exact time,

238
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
 and then she'd go around and sell it to people.

239
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,000
 It feels a bit rude, someone approaching you saying, "Do you want to know the time?"

240
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,000
 It feels a bit, "Do you want to have a good time?"

241
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
 Well, that was the problem.

242
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:51,000
 So in 1908, there was a guy called Mr. St John Wynne who publicly made some comments about Ruth Belville

243
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:55,000
 saying that she was using her femininity to gain business.

244
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
 Oh.

245
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,000
 You used the tricks at your disposal.

246
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
 Well, exactly.

247
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,000
 Was it sort of flirting with people as she offered them the time?

248
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
 "Do you want to have a good time or a long time?"

249
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
 Or an accurate time.

250
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:13,000
 But then what happened was, what people didn't realise was,

251
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:17,000
 is that Wynne was the director of something called the Standard Time Company,

252
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,000
 which sold the time through telegraphs.

253
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:25,000
 And so he wanted people to get the accurate time through the telegraph system

254
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
 and stop using people like Ruth Belville.

255
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,000
 So that's why he kind of slandered her with this thing.

256
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,000
 It feels like using a sledgehammer to crack a nut

257
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,000
 to have to deliberately crush this poor woman

258
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:40,000
 who's only means of making living is to go around asking people if they need to know what time it is.

259
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
 That's so mean.

260
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:46,000
 Yeah, although I do think that she was probably on the way out anyway, technology-wise.

261
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:50,000
 I don't think she'd still exist today, even if he hadn't come along.

262
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:54,000
 I reckon I'd be using my cashier watch and not when there is passing lady.

263
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:58,000
 I reckon you could walk around town in London next to all those broken clocks

264
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:02,000
 and just say, "This one's broken, mate. Do you want to know the time?"

265
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
 Come on in.

266
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,000
 I should say, yeah, John Belville wasn't the astronomer royal.

267
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
 Sorry, he was employed by the astronomer royal

268
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:12,000
 because the astronomer was getting so annoyed at people asking him the time.

269
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
 And then Ruth was his descendant.

270
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,000
 That's right.

271
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:19,000
 I've always thought that the sort of big synchronisation of everything

272
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:22,000
 to the second that we've had since smartphones have come along

273
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:27,000
 is basically the biggest argument about there being some sort of weird psychic power.

274
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:31,000
 Like, all that stuff you hear about some psychic field connecting people together.

275
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:36,000
 Because basically, on the hour, every hour to the second, somewhere in the world,

276
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:40,000
 a huge number of people get startled awake by alarms.

277
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,000
 Like, there is this wave travelling around the world.

278
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:46,000
 Like, 7am, 8am, 9am, every country,

279
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:50,000
 millions of people suddenly get jolted awake at the same time.

280
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,000
 Are you guys one of the people who always sets your alarm for a round number

281
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:56,000
 or for a non-round number when you wake up in the morning?

282
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,000
 A round number.

283
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
 Yeah.

284
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,000
 Round number.

285
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:02,000
 Do you mean a five minute, do you mean like 7am or 7am?

286
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:07,000
 Well, I would always like to set mine for like 12, not 12, 7am.

287
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:10,000
 Let's say it was 7am that I woke up in the daytime.

288
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:17,000
 I would like to set it for 7.37am rather than 7.30am or 7.45am always.

289
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:20,000
 The only time I do that is when I'm convincing myself

290
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
 I'm literally going to have a two minute nap.

291
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:27,000
 And I'll set, you know, it'll be 7.30 and I'll set it for 7.32 or something.

292
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:31,000
 I think the idea is that by looking at a time which is slightly weird,

293
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:34,000
 it kind of confuses me enough that it wakes me up slightly,

294
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,000
 that I don't kind of, if it's 7.30, I'll just look at it at 7.30

295
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
 and go straight back to sleep again.

296
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:42,000
 Oh, you'll think, oh yeah, it's a normal time, 7.30.

297
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,000
 7.37, what the hell is this?

298
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
 I did it from when I was a kid and I had a paper round,

299
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:50,000
 so I don't, like, it's just a hangover, I guess.

300
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
 If you were getting up at noon for your paper round, James,

301
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
 I can see why it didn't last.

302
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,000
 So, just back to the pneumatic system in Paris.

303
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:00,000
 This was actually not Paris' last pneumatic system.

304
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:04,000
 You could send someone pneumatically driven post in Paris,

305
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,000
 so, you know, pneumatic tubes, where you put a capsule in,

306
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
 the capsule gets whizzed off to someone.

307
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
 You could do that until 1984.

308
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
 Which is really late.

309
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:17,000
 That is late, but it kind of still feels to me like the future.

310
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:21,000
 Putting things in pneumatic tubes feels like what it will be

311
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:24,000
 like in 300 years, but actually it's done.

312
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
 You're absolutely right.

313
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
 I mean, it is very futuristic.

314
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
 It's sort of the past version of the future.

315
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
 Well, it is efficient. It goes pretty fast.

316
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,000
 Any more, Andy?

317
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:36,000
 I mean, there's one final thing, which is just kind of cute,

318
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:40,000
 which is that Berlin used to have pneumatic nightclubs,

319
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,000
 so you would get shown to a table,

320
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
 and then your table had a phone on it, right?

321
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
 And you could see an attractor stranger across the club,

322
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
 and you could give them a ring,

323
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
 because all the tables had big numbers,

324
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
 table numbers lit up above them, right?

325
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
 And you could give them a ring, but if you were shy,

326
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
 you could send them a pneumatic tube message,

327
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,000
 and it would sort of up to their table,

328
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
 and it would say, hey, do you fancy a drink?

329
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
 That sounds really cool.

330
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:08,000
 But all the messages were sent via a sensor, a female sensor,

331
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
 to make sure you weren't getting too fresh with someone.

332
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,000
 So to make sure you weren't saying something really obscene.

333
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:16,000
 So did they have to install a little female guard inside the tube

334
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,000
 who stopped it halfway through and read it?

335
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
 Oh, no, because you'd need a post office, wouldn't you?

336
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
 You'd need a switching system.

337
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
 Unless you've got, like, every tube going to every place,

338
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
 you need someone in the middle who can look at the note.

339
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,000
 Exactly.

340
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,000
 And route it anyway.

341
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,000
 Of course.

342
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
 I think you might have given the tube to a waiter who took it to the sensor,

343
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
 who then posted it onto the table.

344
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
 I mean, it sounds like a very complicated system

345
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
 compared with just normal talking, but...

346
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:43,000
 [Music]

347
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:47,000
 OK, it is time for fact number three, and that is James' fact.

348
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
 OK, my fact this week is,

349
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:53,000
 after a penguin had to be isolated due to health issues,

350
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,000
 zookeepers in Perth are keeping him entertained

351
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,000
 by letting him binge watch Pingu.

352
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:02,000
 I thought we've been a bit highbrow up to now,

353
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,000
 so we should probably talk about Pingu for a while.

354
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:08,000
 So, this is a penguin called Pierre.

355
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,000
 They found him washed up in Australia,

356
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
 and they're a little bit worried about him.

357
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
 Washed up in a sort of...washed up in a...

358
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,000
 Celebrity.

359
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,000
 ...psychological sense, you know.

360
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:20,000
 Drugs, gambling, booze, girls, cocaine.

361
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,000
 Crill.

362
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,000
 That's horrible.

363
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,000
 So much, too much krill.

364
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,000
 Crill addiction.

365
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
 So, it's a washed up penguin, sorry.

366
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
 Washed up penguin, and the thing is about penguins, right,

367
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,000
 is if you're a penguin, your feathers are really important

368
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
 because you might get too cold,

369
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:36,000
 and also they're really important for you to swim

370
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
 because they're really water resistant.

371
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
 And so, most birds, when they molt,

372
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
 they kind of lose a few feathers here and a few feathers there,

373
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,000
 and they grow back.

374
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
 But penguins don't do that.

375
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:48,000
 They do, like, an explosive, molting period

376
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
 where they lose...

377
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,000
 Sorry.

378
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,000
 Sorry.

379
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
 I know what you mean,

380
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
 but let's just all take a moment to appreciate the phrase

381
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
 "explosive molting period"

382
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:00,000
 because there's feathers everywhere.

383
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,000
 It's messy.

384
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
 I think there's an actual word for it, which is...

385
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
 I think it's called a catastrophic molt,

386
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
 which is almost as entertaining.

387
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,000
 Do you know what?

388
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,000
 I read about this a few months ago,

389
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:12,000
 and I knew it had a really impressive name,

390
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
 but I just remembered the wrong word.

391
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,000
 But anyway, so, they have a catastrophic molt,

392
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:20,000
 and so, for a little while, they have no feathers,

393
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
 but then they grow back quite quickly.

394
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
 But with Pierre, they never really grew back properly,

395
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,000
 and so, he's kind of stuck in Perth for a little while.

396
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:30,000
 He can't really go anywhere else until his feathers come back.

397
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
 And so, he's stuck in Perth.

398
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
 He doesn't really have any mates there,

399
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
 so they wanted to show him videos of penguins,

400
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,000
 which they did.

401
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:40,000
 They showed him videos of certain other rock hopper penguins

402
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
 in Edinburgh Zoo, but they also thought,

403
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
 "Well, why don't we show him pingu,

404
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
 'cause pingu is a penguin, isn't he?"

405
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,000
 And Daniel Henry, who's looking after Pierre and the zoo,

406
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:52,000
 said he probably doesn't even realise that pingu is a penguin.

407
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
 He's just responding to the colour and the movement,

408
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
 which I suppose is probably true.

409
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
 James, is this a way of you working in the fact

410
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
 that he doesn't even know he's a penguin?

411
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
 That's your main fact, really.

412
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
 It's my next level.

413
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,000
 My next level of Stinean philosophy

414
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
 is that penguins don't know they're penguins,

415
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
 but they don't even know pingu is a penguin.

416
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
 Wow.

417
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
 If pingu could talk, would we be able to understand him?

418
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
 Well, can pingu talk?

419
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
 He goes, "Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah."

420
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
 Yeah, pingu can talk, and we can understand him.

421
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
 We can. Yeah, it's bizarre.

422
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
 So, did you guys look into this as well,

423
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
 the sort of language of pingu? It's so cool.

424
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
 Yeah.

425
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
 Because pingu has only ever been voiced

426
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
 by people with training in clowning,

427
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
 and there's an Italian theatre language

428
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
 called Gramolo or Gramalot,

429
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:40,000
 where it's sort of designed to sound like gibberish,

430
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
 and they convert the scripts from English

431
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
 into penguins, as they call it,

432
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
 and then they film those.

433
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:49,000
 There's a lovely interview with Oliver Postgate

434
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
 about the Clangas, and it's exactly the same.

435
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
 The Clangas scripts were written in English,

436
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
 and then translated.

437
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:59,000
 I say translated, they're just playing on swanee whistles.

438
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
 But there is a lovely interview.

439
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
 Here we are.

440
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:06,000
 At the beginning of episode three, when the doors get stuck,

441
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:09,000
 Major Clangas says, "Sod it, the bloody things stuck again,"

442
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:13,000
 and the BBC objected and required the script to be changed,

443
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
 even though it's just a swanee whistle.

444
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:18,000
 So, you've got a whistle making the phrase "sod it,"

445
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
 the doors are stuck.

446
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:23,000
 If you change the script to "sod it,"

447
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
 the doors are frothy.

448
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
 Like, it's going to sound exactly the same, isn't it?

449
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
 Like, the whistle.

450
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
 Well, apparently, according to the interview,

451
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
 like, this is many years later,

452
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
 so who knows how much of it changed, how much of it is memory here,

453
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
 but they changed to,

454
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
 "Oh, dear, the silly things not working properly,"

455
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
 and I feel like that does have

456
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
 a different kind of intonation to it.

457
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
 I'm with you. I think the original version

458
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
 would have got countless complaints.

459
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
 I think "Sod it" goes [whistles]

460
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
 whereas "Oh, dear" goes [whistles]

461
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
 like that.

462
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
 That's quite a big difference, isn't it?

463
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
 That was also a wolf whistle,

464
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
 so my clang of translation is not great.

465
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
 Yeah, the second one was more offensive,

466
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
 it turned out.

467
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
 Grammar lot is really interesting, isn't it?

468
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:08,000
 Because it came from, like, medieval Italy,

469
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,000
 and it was when gestures used to go round

470
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
 to all the different towns of Italy,

471
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:16,000
 and they would want to do their plays and their comedies,

472
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
 but all the different people in the different towns

473
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
 didn't speak the same language in those days,

474
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,000
 or they might have spoken a similar kind of Italian,

475
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
 but each village would be slightly different.

476
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
 And so you would have to come up,

477
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
 it's a bit like how Mr Bean is so popular

478
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
 all around the world, because he doesn't really talk,

479
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
 so you would have to get your point across,

480
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
 but in a way where you don't need

481
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
 to say the actual words.

482
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
 And also, there's quite a lot of censorship,

483
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
 so you want to say the things in a way

484
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
 where you're saying, "Oh, you know,

485
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
 the king is an asshole,"

486
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
 but you didn't want to say it in so many words,

487
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
 so you go [whistles] like that.

488
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:52,000
 You would just make the noises that everyone would realise

489
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
 that that's what you're saying,

490
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
 but you wouldn't actually say the words.

491
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
 It works by onomatopoeia basically, doesn't it?

492
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
 Yeah, so for instance...

493
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,000
 It's a kind of onomatopoeia where the sound conveys meaning

494
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
 and emotion.

495
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
 So, for instance, in grammar lots,

496
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
 if you wanted to say something was big,

497
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
 you would go boo-woo.

498
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:14,000
 But if it was medium-sized, you would go woo-hoo.

499
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,000
 And if it was really small, you would say ee-oo.

500
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:20,000
 And so everyone listening knows that what you're talking about

501
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
 is something that's big or something that's small

502
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:25,000
 just by the noise that you're making with your voice.

503
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
 It's quite cool.

504
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,000
 That's really cool.

505
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
 And it meant Pingu became a global brand, doesn't it?

506
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,000
 Exactly.

507
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,000
 So it was madly popular.

508
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
 You still get Pingu dolls in Happy Meals in Japan.

509
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,000
 Really?

510
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,000
 Wow.

511
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,000
 It's really popular in Japan

512
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
 because they think it sounds like Japanese,

513
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
 and people in other countries think,

514
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
 "Oh, yeah, he's sort of speaking our language,"

515
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
 which shows how everyone thinks

516
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:48,000
 that he's speaking to them.

517
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
 I didn't know how they made it,

518
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:53,000
 because I thought they would move the clay,

519
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
 because it's claymation, Pingu.

520
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
 I thought they would move the clay

521
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
 and sort of take a different photo at every point.

522
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:02,000
 But you have to have hundreds and hundreds of Pingu's.

523
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
 So somewhere there's a box of Pingu doing

524
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
 every conceivable activity in the show.

525
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
 And then if you show Pingu walking,

526
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
 you take stationary Pingu,

527
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:13,000
 and you replace him with a Pingu who's lifted up one foot,

528
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
 and then you replace him with a Pingu who's lifted up even more.

529
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
 So you need eight Pingu's just to show him walking along.

530
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,000
 Really?

531
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,000
 I didn't know that.

532
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
 I thought they would have just moved them, yeah.

533
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,000
 Exactly, yeah.

534
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
 That's one of those things that, in hindsight,

535
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,000
 makes a lot of sense.

536
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,000
 Yeah, once you've got all of them.

537
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:29,000
 And you need Pingu's where he's being squashed into a ball

538
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:32,000
 by an older, angry Pinguin or whatever.

539
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
 There's hundreds and hundreds of them.

540
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
 They always need to be in the right order, I suppose,

541
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
 and they can't operate unless they have each other.

542
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:41,000
 There'll be one Pingu, but in order to walk anywhere,

543
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
 it needs to find ten other Pingu's.

544
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,000
 Yes.

545
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
 It's a great, I think it's a plot waiting to be written.

546
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,000
 It's an analogy for how society only works

547
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
 if we all work together in one direction, isn't it?

548
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
 We're basically all Pingu.

549
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
 James, did you just say one direction?

550
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,000
 Oh, dear.

551
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,000
 I have a link.

552
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
 I have a link, which is there.

553
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,000
 Here we go.

554
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,000
 Harry Styles of One Direction has a tattoo of Pingu,

555
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
 and Ed Sheeran has a matching one.

556
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:10,000
 God, this is the most pop culture this podcast has ever been.

557
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
 We've only done tribals here for this.

558
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:16,000
 Who got theirs first because they have a right to be pissed off?

559
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:19,000
 I think Sheeran, I think they got it at the same time.

560
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:22,000
 I've read this as well, same tattoo artist,

561
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
 and they did it because they got drunk and realised

562
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
 that they were both Pingu fans when they were kids,

563
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:29,000
 and so they thought this is something that brings us together.

564
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
 So they're definitely worth commemorating.

565
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
 I mean, everyone's a Pingu fan when they're a kid.

566
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,000
 I never watched Pingu.

567
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
 I don't know, and I haven't seen your tattoo,

568
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
 so are you really a Pingu fan?

569
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:42,000
 I keep my Pingu tattoo where I keep my pocket watch, I'm afraid.

570
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:46,000
 You were saying about when Pingu gets smacked on the head

571
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
 and turned into a ball sometimes.

572
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:51,000
 Well, some of those got banned, didn't they?

573
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:55,000
 There's a Pingu fandom page online.

574
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,000
 Of course there is.

575
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:59,000
 And it's got a brilliant list of all the episodes of Pingu

576
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:02,000
 that have been censored from around the world.

577
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
 So in the first ever episode of Pingu,

578
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,000
 I've seen the video of this, it's quite violent.

579
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:10,000
 Ping, which I think might be his mother.

580
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
 I have never seen Pingu either, I have to admit.

581
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:15,000
 But smacks Pingu on the head and just keeps whacking him on the head

582
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:18,000
 like again and again and again in a really quite violent way.

583
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:22,000
 And that got edited out by the BBC when it was released on VHS

584
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:25,000
 because they thought we shall be showing kids.

585
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:28,000
 Basically they're being shown to very, very young children.

586
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
 So, you know, it's like basically you start there

587
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
 and then you go to Grand Theft Auto

588
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:35,000
 and then who knows what happens after that.

589
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:38,000
 And then you've got terrorism.

590
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
 That's interesting because he is really naughty.

591
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:43,000
 Pingu is really naughty and there's a version.

592
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:47,000
 I think a Pingu after dark DVD would sell like hotcakes.

593
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:50,000
 And actually at the North Pole it's always dark.

594
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,000
 Andy.

595
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,000
 Oh no, hang on.

596
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,000
 Are they from the South Pole?

597
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,000
 From the South Pole.

598
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,000
 South Pole, yes.

599
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:58,000
 There's so many things running in that sentence.

600
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
 Poor Andy, Ed Sheeran and Harry Styles

601
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,000
 gathered at the North Pole with the DVDs there.

602
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
 What's going on?

603
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:08,000
 We've fucked this up.

604
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
 I don't have anything else on Pingu.

605
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,000
 I only have real penguins.

606
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:14,000
 I've got some stuff on penguins

607
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
 and talking about colours and shapes.

608
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:19,000
 There's some research by Nico Tinbergen,

609
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
 who's a Dutch biologist and ornithologist

610
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:24,000
 on supernormal stimulus.

611
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:27,000
 So this is the idea that you can build an artificial object

612
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:30,000
 with sort of big obvious features

613
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:34,000
 and the birds will prefer that over their actual mother

614
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
 or the actual eggs that they're meant to lay.

615
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,000
 Tinbergen took oyster catches,

616
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
 which are kind of wading birds,

617
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:44,000
 and they sort of have small, mottled coloured eggs.

618
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:48,000
 And he added in an egg almost as big as the bird itself

619
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
 with high contrast black and white spots

620
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:54,000
 and the birds preferred to incubate that one

621
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
 even though it's clearly not an egg

622
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:59,000
 just because it has a bigger stimulus.

623
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
 I also found several references to say

624
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
 even when the egg was so big

625
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
 that the bird kept sliding off it.

626
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
 And that is not in the original study.

627
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
 I can't find that anywhere.

628
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:12,000
 I think someone just came up with the image of an oyster catcher

629
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
 just constantly sliding off an oversized egg

630
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,000
 and thought it was funny.

631
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
 Well, this should help them documentary makers

632
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
 to film penguins, surely,

633
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:22,000
 because they tinker around with making fake ones

634
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:25,000
 in order to infiltrate the flocks, don't they?

635
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
 So I think there are some documentary makers last year

636
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
 or the year before who made a fake penguin

637
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
 and then put a camera on the inside of it.

638
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
 What is it made out of?

639
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
 Is it like a child in a tuxedo or...

640
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,000
 Yeah.

641
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
 Holding a camera on its shoulder.

642
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
 What is it, like a plastic cast or something?

643
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
 Oh, no, it's very fluffy.

644
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,000
 It's really cute.

645
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
 It's a baby and it's got a normal penguin's head

646
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:48,000
 and then it looks like it's just got a huge fluffy skirt or cloak

647
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
 and then it's on wheels and it wheels along.

648
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
 And the penguins much prefer that

649
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
 and get much less stress than every human's there.

650
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
 And it causes problems, actually.

651
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:59,000
 There was one who, a researcher, I think,

652
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:02,000
 who created a fake penguin

653
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:05,000
 which one of the males started to try and flirt with

654
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:08,000
 and to mate with and his original mate came over

655
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
 in a jealous rage and attacked it

656
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
 and sort of ruined the fake penguin

657
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:16,000
 because, you know, thought this is a threat to my men.

658
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,000
 If you're studying penguins

659
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:20,000
 and you're a human actually going in with the penguins,

660
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,000
 that could be a problem

661
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
 because I'm sure you all saw this study this year

662
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:27,000
 where researchers are getting high off laughing gas

663
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:30,000
 which is produced by the poo of penguins.

664
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:33,000
 So the penguin poo kind of prevents

665
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:36,000
 and then it gives off this, what is laughing gas?

666
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
 Nitrous oxide.

667
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
 Yeah, it gives off nitrous oxide.

668
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,000
 And then they can, it says,

669
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:44,000
 after nosing about in the guano for several hours,

670
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
 one goes completely cuckoo, feeling.

671
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:49,000
 Nosing about in the guano.

672
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:52,000
 Yeah, I think that could be a thing for us

673
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
 to put in our new nightclub

674
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:57,000
 which is mostly fractal patterns induced

675
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:00,000
 by going a lot in a buggy past the plane trees.

676
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
 Then you get to the end of the plane trees

677
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
 and you get a big pile of poo to sniff with you.

678
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
 Because actually, like nitrous oxide,

679
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
 it's like hippie crack, isn't it, they call it?

680
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:11,000
 And it's really bad for the environment to make it and stuff.

681
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:14,000
 And so like it's really hard for the hippies

682
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:17,000
 because they want to have the nitrous oxide hit

683
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
 and they also don't want to wreck the environment.

684
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:22,000
 But we're not blaming the penguins for generating it, are we?

685
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,000
 No, no, no, no.

686
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:26,000
 No, but what I'm saying is like it's quite an ethical way

687
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
 of getting your laughing gas fixed

688
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
 is to have a penguin in the corner of your room

689
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
 just shitting everyone.

690
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:35,000
 If you have a penguin on the podium in the nightclubs,

691
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:38,000
 then everyone could just gather round and get a hit off that.

692
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:41,000
 And then you send a little message on your pneumatic tube saying,

693
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
 "Meet me by the penguin."

694
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
 This nightclub is going to be fresh.

695
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
 It's going to be really good.

696
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
 They do have the same thing as we have,

697
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,000
 the cocktail party effect,

698
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
 which I find really amazing about penguins.

699
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:55,000
 So you know when you go into a crowded room,

700
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
 you're meeting your friend in a bar or something

701
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,000
 and it's very loud.

702
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,000
 Not anymore, no.

703
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
 Do you remember?

704
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
 I definitely recall this, yeah.

705
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
 You know when you're going to an illegal rave

706
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:08,000
 and before the police arrive,

707
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:12,000
 you're looking for your mate and if they're speaking at the bar,

708
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,000
 then you'll recognise their voice

709
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:16,000
 and be able to distinguish it from the cacophony of sound all around.

710
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:19,000
 And penguins do this to an incredible extent.

711
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,000
 So if they're parenting,

712
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
 the parents take turns to go out and hunt

713
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
 and then return to their mate,

714
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
 who will be the one who's sitting on the egg

715
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,000
 or looking after the offspring.

716
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:30,000
 And when they return,

717
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:33,000
 they return to a colony of like 10,000 other penguins

718
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
 and they all have individual calls

719
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
 that they'll be able to recognise.

720
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
 So they'll be hearing 10,000 calls,

721
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
 but they'll be able to pick out the one call

722
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:44,000
 that's meant for them, which is their mate saying,

723
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:47,000
 "Can you come the fuck here and give me my dinner, please?"

724
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:50,000
 And they can track that down, which I think is extraordinary.

725
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,000
 That is amazing.

726
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,000
 It's incredible.

727
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,000
 When you said cocktail party effect,

728
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,000
 I thought it was the thing

729
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
 where you just have a lot of penguins altogether.

730
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
 And then just through coincidence,

731
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
 they all go silent at the same moment.

732
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
 And one penguin just says something really loud

733
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
 and offensive over the top of everything else.

734
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:07,000
 Barry's been hogging the fish.

735
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:08,000
 Yeah.

736
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:16,000
 All right, it is time for our final fact of the week,

737
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
 and that is my fact.

738
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
 And my fact this week is that the person who measured

739
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:24,000
 the world's tallest tree did so by climbing to the top of it

740
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
 and dropping a tape measure down.

741
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
 How smart. How else would you do it?

742
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
 It makes more sense than standing at the bottom of it

743
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
 and slowly pushing the tape measure upwards,

744
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,000
 hoping it doesn't bend.

745
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
 You know those mechanical ones

746
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:36,000
 where you can keep pushing it up.

747
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
 And then that was the game you always played as a kid, wasn't it,

748
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:41,000
 to see how far you could get it before it collapsed on itself.

749
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:42,000
 Yeah.

750
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
 I don't think you ever got it as tall as this tree.

751
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:48,000
 I'm fairly sure that there's the world tape measure championship somewhere,

752
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:51,000
 which is entirely about how far you can extend that arm.

753
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:52,000
 Oh, my God.

754
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:55,000
 So, Anna, when you're taking your year off to do all the clocks of London,

755
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:56,000
 this is what I'm going to do.

756
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
 You train for this championships.

757
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
 I say that,

758
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:03,000
 but that may just have been something that some friends of mine did once.

759
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,000
 It seems like something there must be.

760
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:06,000
 I mean, why wouldn't there?

761
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
 There must be a Guinness record for...

762
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:11,000
 I don't know if there's a record for the longest tape measure.

763
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000
 It feels like we're missing the main point of this,

764
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
 which is that there's a massive tree somewhere.

765
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,000
 Oh, there's a tree. Sorry, there's a tree, yeah.

766
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:19,000
 I think it's mostly about the tape measures, which I should specify.

767
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:23,000
 Probably it's not one of your, you know, day-to-day tape measures.

768
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:26,000
 I think he just dropped some tape from the top once he got there,

769
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
 and then they would have measured that.

770
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:31,000
 But this is this amazing guy called Steve Sillett,

771
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
 who is an ecologist,

772
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:36,000
 and he's been really into tall trees since the 80s,

773
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:41,000
 and he's the first person who ever ended up in a redwood tree canopy.

774
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:45,000
 So I think it was like 1987, he was 19,

775
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
 and he saw a redwood tree, a giant redwood,

776
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:50,000
 looked at it and then ran at it and scaled it

777
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:53,000
 and went up about, you know, almost 300 feet and thought,

778
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:56,000
 "Well, I love this. I'm going to do this for a living."

779
00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:00,000
 And he's one of our leading botanists,

780
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:04,000
 and he identified this tree, the tree is called Hyperion.

781
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:08,000
 It's a coast redwood in California, and it's 116 meters tall,

782
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:11,000
 which is sort of significantly higher than the Statue of Liberty.

783
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:14,000
 And he, yeah, some hikers came across it and thought,

784
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:17,000
 "That looks like a big tree. Let's tell someone about it."

785
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
 You can't just, like, put a helicopter above all the trees

786
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
 and just say, "Oh, that's the tallest one, can you?"

787
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:24,000
 Because the undulations in the land, they might be growing.

788
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:27,000
 The bottom might be lower, right, is that the point?

789
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
 Well, I think measuring trees is difficult,

790
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:32,000
 although there are other ways to do it, like easy ways to do it,

791
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:36,000
 but this guy happens to love climbing them, so they call this guy,

792
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
 and that's the most accurate way of doing it.

793
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
 You get it, you know, to the nearest centre.

794
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:43,000
 Actually, hang on, hang on, how do you define the top of a tree?

795
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
 Because if he's dropped the tape measure down,

796
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
 he can't be perched on top of the highest leaf.

797
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
 That's a really good point.

798
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:52,000
 He's got two tape measures.

799
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:55,000
 One, he pushes up to the level with the method.

800
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
 He uses the Harkin method.

801
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
 Exactly, exactly, and then the other one he drops.

802
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,000
 He has to add the two together, so it's an extra line

803
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,000
 on the spreadsheet at the end.

804
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:07,000
 I think he might give the tape measure to a passing bird

805
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:10,000
 and ask it to just, or maybe a little ant or something,

806
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:13,000
 and ask it to scale those last few leaves.

807
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
 An ant. Yeah, well, you need something very light, don't you?

808
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:18,000
 And maybe then the ant gives it to an even smaller ant

809
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
 that just does a little bit of the top.

810
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:21,000
 Exactly.

811
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
 Isn't he afraid of heights, this guy, Steve Savage?

812
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:24,000
 He does have a few of heights, yeah.

813
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
 I mean, he's picked the worst job.

814
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
 I'm skeptical about whether feeling nervous

815
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:31,000
 when you've scaled over 300-foot redwood

816
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:34,000
 and looking down and feeling nervous is a fear of heights

817
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
 or just kind of a rational human response

818
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
 to being in a dangerous situation.

819
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
 But he does claim it's a fear of heights, yeah.

820
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:44,000
 So I have a theory that this isn't the tallest tree in the world.

821
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
 Oh, go on.

822
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:49,000
 My theory is that the largest tree in the world

823
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,000
 is a fig tree in South Africa.

824
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:55,000
 And that's because I'm counting the root to tip.

825
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
 So I'm including the roots.

826
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:01,000
 And there is a fig tree above the echo caves in Limpopo,

827
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
 which is only about 10 metres above the ground,

828
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:07,000
 but its roots reach 120 metres underground.

829
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:10,000
 So from the bottom of the roots to the top, I reckon it's longer,

830
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:14,000
 because redwood roots are all quite shallow and quite wide.

831
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:17,000
 They don't go particularly deep like most roots don't go that deep,

832
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
 but this one, they go super deep.

833
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:23,000
 I don't think it's a theory so much as a trick, a language trick.

834
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:26,000
 Yeah, fair enough.

835
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
 Oh, no, I think that tree's got a claim.

836
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
 It can shout that to all the surrounding trees

837
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:33,000
 towering above it if it makes it feel better.

838
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:34,000
 I think that's okay.

839
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:37,000
 I think, again, there's like some kind of story

840
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,000
 that we can all relate to about being small,

841
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:42,000
 but underneath being really, anyway.

842
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:46,000
 So, yeah, these caves in Limpopo,

843
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
 basically the figs do have long roots anyway,

844
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
 but they were searching for water,

845
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
 and they went all the way down because in this cave,

846
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
 there's like a big water system,

847
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
 and we only found out about the roots

848
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:59,000
 because people went into this cave and saw the roots

849
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
 and thought, "Where the hell did they come from?"

850
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:02,000
 because we're so far underground,

851
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
 and then they worked out that it was this tree.

852
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
 Wow, that's really cool.

853
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:09,000
 That must be deeper than lots of underground lines.

854
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,000
 Yeah, for sure.

855
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000
 It's extraordinarily deep,

856
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,000
 given that most, I think most tree roots

857
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:19,000
 don't even go more than one metre below the ground.

858
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:22,000
 120 metres, it's gone insane.

859
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:25,000
 It could be just wrong, of course,

860
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:29,000
 because the tallest tree that was ever measured, ever,

861
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:32,000
 this was a eucalyptus in Australia.

862
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
 It had fallen down and they measured it,

863
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
 and it was 133 metres high,

864
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
 which would be higher than Hyperion,

865
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:42,000
 but most people now think that they just didn't measure it correctly

866
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:45,000
 because they've never found any other eucalyptuses

867
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,000
 that were nearly that tall,

868
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:50,000
 and it was in 1871 when maybe tape measures

869
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
 weren't quite as good as they are today.

870
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
 Yeah.

871
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
 That is obviously the easiest way to measure a tree

872
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:59,000
 is to cut it down and do it long ways, but not recommended.

873
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:03,000
 I don't think we've ever mentioned Donald Curry on this podcast.

874
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
 Do you remember him?

875
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:08,000
 He was a tree researcher in the '60s,

876
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:11,000
 and he was taking samples from a really old tree

877
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:15,000
 called Prometheus, and two of his drill bits

878
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,000
 broke inside the tree.

879
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,000
 He was trying to remove a little core,

880
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,000
 see how old it was, and he asked for permission.

881
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:22,000
 He said, "Well, this is really annoying

882
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,000
 because I need to know how old this tree is."

883
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
 He asked for permission from the US Forest Service

884
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000
 to cut it down, and they granted permission,

885
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000
 so he chopped down the tree,

886
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000
 and it turned out to be almost 5,000 years old,

887
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:36,000
 and it was the oldest tree that had ever been discovered,

888
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
 and he chopped it down.

889
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:42,000
 And he later switched to studying lakes.

890
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:45,000
 Which he promptly drilled into and drained.

891
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,000
 I just need to drain this lake to find out how old it is.

892
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,000
 I'm sorry.

893
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,000
 Just to say, you can't, just in case you want to go

894
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,000
 and find Hyperion, the world's tallest tree, you can't.

895
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,000
 So don't try.

896
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
 They keep the location of these trees top secret now,

897
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,000
 so people don't go in accidentally,

898
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,000
 sort of kill them with love, I think, is how...

899
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:04,000
 I think it might have been Steve Sillert who said it like that.

900
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:07,000
 You know, you go, you hug it, you trample on its roots.

901
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,000
 You kind of etch your name into it and stuff.

902
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,000
 Exactly.

903
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,000
 Because you write it so much.

904
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,000
 He also thinks that its growth might have been stunted,

905
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,000
 so it could have got even higher,

906
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,000
 but there's a woodpecker that lives right at the top.

907
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:22,000
 I think right at the top, and it looks like it's just damaged the tip.

908
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,000
 No.

909
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,000
 Oh my God.

910
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
 That's so frustrating.

911
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:31,000
 Something else, or someone else who was measured by dangling a tape measure,

912
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:34,000
 is the world's tallest ever woman.

913
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:38,000
 OK, so I kind of heard about the world's tallest man quite a lot,

914
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
 who was Wadlow, something like that,

915
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
 William Wadlow or something.

916
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:43,000
 Robert Wadlow.

917
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:44,000
 Robert Wadlow, that's right.

918
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
 But I'd never really read about the tallest woman,

919
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
 and she's got a name that's really easy for QI fans to remember.

920
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
 Can you guess what that would be?

921
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:51,000
 Stephen Fry.

922
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:52,000
 No.

923
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:53,000
 Sandy Toxford.

924
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,000
 Sandy is right, and it's her name.

925
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:56,000
 Brian?

926
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,000
 No, Alan, Sandy Allen.

927
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,000
 So she was the tallest ever woman,

928
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:03,000
 and she worked at an oil company,

929
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:06,000
 and her co-workers realised that she was really tall.

930
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:09,000
 It's kind of sad because she had a pituitary issue.

931
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:12,000
 But her co-workers realised that she was really tall,

932
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:15,000
 and so they climbed up on a load of chairs and desks,

933
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:19,000
 and then dangled a tape measure from the top of her head to the bottom,

934
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,000
 and then took a photo of it and sent it to Guinness,

935
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,000
 and Guinness used that to say,

936
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:26,000
 "Yes, this is the tallest lady that's ever lived."

937
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
 And then she became really famous.

938
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
 She was in a film with Donald Sutherland,

939
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,000
 and she would go around initially kind of doing,

940
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,000
 you know, Rip, please believe it, or not shows,

941
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:37,000
 but then eventually she went round going to different schools

942
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:40,000
 and churches and stuff like that, not for money,

943
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:43,000
 just to do talks about how if you're different,

944
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:47,000
 it doesn't really matter, and you can make the most of what you are

945
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:48,000
 and stuff like that.

946
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000
 And she had her own phone number that people could ring,

947
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:53,000
 which was 1-888-BIG-SANDY,

948
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:57,000
 and they would play her little speech that she always did

949
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,000
 about how being tall is no problem.

950
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:03,000
 Was she married to Tom Cruise for a while?

951
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,000
 I feel like she was.

952
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:09,000
 Yeah, I certainly looked that way, but it wasn't.

953
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:13,000
 But yeah, and then eventually she did get sick

954
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
 and ended up in a home,

955
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:18,000
 and in the home that she was in, which was in Shelbyville, Indiana,

956
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:21,000
 she was there at the same time as Edna Parker,

957
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:24,000
 who was the world's oldest living human at the time.

958
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:27,000
 So you could go to this retirement home place

959
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:30,000
 and see the world's tallest woman and the world's oldest person

960
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
 at the same time if you wanted.

961
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,000
 But she's really cool, like this lady, honestly,

962
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
 I'd never heard about her, she's super cool.

963
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
 God, I wonder what the tension was like between those two.

964
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
 I bet there were sort of two clans,

965
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:43,000
 like the Jets and the Sharks in that old people's home.

966
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:48,000
 I think that would be a great setting for a crime scenario.

967
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:54,000
 Like a crime solvers, you know, one of them's old and one of them's tall.

968
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,000
 And oh, yeah, commission that.

969
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:57,000
 It's serious.

970
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:01,000
 Every single crime is related to a high concealed clue

971
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:04,000
 or something that happened in 1912.

972
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:10,000
 This reminds me of something that happened in the Stockholm Olympics.

973
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:16,000
 Oh, but our book about the Stockholm Olympics is on the top shelf.

974
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,000
 It's OK, I could...

975
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:21,000
 Yeah.

976
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:24,000
 This is going to be like the nightclub. This is going to be fresh.

977
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:25,000
 Yep.

978
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,000
 I got the Christie, eat your heart out.

979
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:32,000
 I read a survey of tape measure ownership in the UK

980
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:36,000
 and the 77% of 18 to 24 year olds own a tape measure

981
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:41,000
 and 100% of the over 65s owns a tape measure.

982
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:42,000
 100%.

983
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:43,000
 Wow.

984
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:44,000
 That's a lot.

985
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
 I want to know what proportion of that 100%

986
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
 of people actually would be able to locate the tape measure

987
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,000
 if you ask them to.

988
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:52,000
 50 marks.

989
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:55,000
 I am in my 30s and had to buy a tape measure last year

990
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,000
 for a thing and now I own a tape measure.

991
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:00,000
 It feels like at some point there is going to be a draw in your house

992
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,000
 and it's going to have a tape measure.

993
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,000
 You'd never... Because people don't get rid of them.

994
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:04,000
 Why would you?

995
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:05,000
 No.

996
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:06,000
 Why would you ever get rid of a tape measure?

997
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:09,000
 It's not big enough to kind of have to throw out

998
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:10,000
 because you're moving.

999
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
 It just sits in the box of stuff.

1000
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:13,000
 You know who would own a tape measure?

1001
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,000
 The world's oldest woman.

1002
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,000
 You know who she'd measure with it?

1003
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:21,000
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1004
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:22,000
 I think we're there.

1005
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:23,000
 Yeah.

1006
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:24,000
 We're there.

1007
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:25,000
 Yeah.

1008
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,000
 OK, that's it.

1009
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,000
 That's all of our facts for this week.

00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,000

 See you then.

1029

 Goodbye.

1030
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:09,000
 (upbeat music)

1031
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,580
 (upbeat music)

1032
00:56:11,580 --> 00:56:14,160
 (upbeat music)
