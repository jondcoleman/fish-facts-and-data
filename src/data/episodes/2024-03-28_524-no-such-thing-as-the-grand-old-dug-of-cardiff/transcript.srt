00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:06,320
 Hi everyone, welcome to this week's episode of No Such Things as Fish.

3
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:12,920
 Andrew Hunter Murray is away this week and so in his place we have one of the QI elves.

4
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:15,400
 It is Lydia Maison.

5
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:21,200
 Now those of you who listen to us occasionally talk to Zoey Ball on Radio 2 might know Lydia.

6
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:25,360
 She's one of our regular elves on the Y workshop.

7
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:31,720
 But also anyone deeply ingrained in UK geek culture will know her name.

8
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:32,720
 Where is it from?

9
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:39,560
 Yes, she was one of the winners of season 13 of Only Connect when she was in the team

10
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:45,560
 of the escapologists a couple of years after we didn't win Only Connect.

11
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:48,160
 I'm really sure you'll enjoy this show with Lydia.

12
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:51,720
 She's very nice, very funny and knows a lot of stuff.

13
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:56,480
 While I'm here I might as well remind you to join Club Fish, especially if you like listening

14
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:01,280
 to all these newer elves because we do a featurette with those guys called Meet the

15
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:05,760
 Elves where they send us a fiendish question and we try to solve it.

16
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,520
 We also have lots of compilations on there.

17
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:13,000
 We have other bonus features like Drop as a Line where people send us correspondence.

18
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,080
 We have quizzes.

19
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:15,080
 We have all sorts.

20
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:19,720
 There's a discord which you can go to and talk to like-minded fish friends.

21
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:26,680
 And if by any chance we were to announce some live shows in the next few months then that

22
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:28,640
 is where you would hear about them first.

23
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:37,360
 So come and join us at Club Fish by going to knowsuchthingsafish.com/apple or knowsuchthingsafish.com/patreon

24
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:39,520
 if you are not an Apple user.

25
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:41,680
 If you're missing Andrew Hunter Murray, fear not.

26
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:46,560
 He will be back very soon and you can always get your fix of Andy by buying one of his

27
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,320
 wonderful bugs.

28
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:54,240
 I believe his latest Beginner's Guide to Breaking and Entering might be available for

29
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,080
 pre-order if you go online.

30
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:57,200
 In fact, yes it is.

31
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,280
 I've just checked.

32
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,520
 So definitely go and get that.

33
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:02,480
 We'll tell you more about that when it actually comes out.

34
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:05,120
 Dan has a book out of course, The Theory of Everything Else.

35
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:09,160
 Me and Anna also have a book out which is Everything to Play for the QI Book of Sports.

36
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:10,720
 Why not buy all three?

37
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:11,720
 Or why not?

38
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:16,600
 Sit back, relax and listen to this episode of Knowsuchthingsafish with QI elf Lydia Meisen.

39
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:34,600
 Okay, on with the podcast.

40
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:40,520
 Hello and welcome to another episode of Knowsuchthingsafish, a weekly podcast coming to you from the QI

41
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:42,400
 offices in Hoburn.

42
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:47,040
 My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here with Anna Tyshinski, James Harkin and Lydia

43
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:51,400
 Meisen and once again we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts

44
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:56,040
 from the last seven days and in no particular order here we go.

45
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:59,040
 Starting with fact number one and that is James.

46
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:06,280
 Okay, my fact this week is that golfer Brenda Keane took part in the 2001 Women's US Open

47
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:11,720
 while eight months pregnant and started contractions on one of her back swings.

48
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:17,440
 The resulting daughter will become a professional golfer later this year.

49
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,440
 So good.

50
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:19,440
 Isn't that amazing?

51
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,480
 Yeah, that is amazing.

52
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:25,440
 How do you know she, how are the rules of golf, I want to get into golf.

53
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,440
 How do we...

54
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:29,560
 Can I just say, dear listener, we're not going to talk about golf this whole section.

55
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:33,880
 Please stay with us, it's okay, that's the condition on which James is permitted another

56
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:34,880
 headline golfer.

57
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:35,880
 We don't discuss golf.

58
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:39,360
 If you really hate golf, maybe just press fast forward about ten times and then we'll

59
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,960
 get on to the normal stuff.

60
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:44,180
 How do you know someone's going to be a pro golfer before they are a pro golfer?

61
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:47,760
 So this is Rachel Keane and she has said in an interview that that's what's going to

62
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:48,760
 happen.

63
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:49,760
 She's now mature at the moment.

64
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:54,160
 She does college golf, she's one of the best and for quite a while she's been saying she's

65
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:58,280
 going to become a professional but yeah, she spoke in golf week saying that she is going

66
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:02,800
 to become a professional this fall or this autumn for English people.

67
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:06,520
 And this is the fact which I learned when watching the Netflix Golf Documentary Series

68
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,520
 Full Swing.

69
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:12,600
 There was an episode about English golfer Alex Fitzpatrick and this was just like a

70
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:15,640
 throwaway line about his partner in that documentary.

71
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:19,680
 P.S. and Netflix, do you feel free to commission anything that we pitched you a future?

72
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:20,680
 We love you.

73
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:24,280
 Can I ask, when she had the contraction, was she mid game and continued the game?

74
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:25,280
 Yep.

75
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,120
 So it happened on the 11th tee.

76
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,080
 So the 11th of 18 holes.

77
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:32,840
 She said I could feel it coming but I was too embarrassed to back out.

78
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:37,200
 She didn't follow through.

79
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,480
 That's a golfing term.

80
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:42,280
 She did her golf follow through and then was doubled up in pain.

81
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:48,200
 The whole round she shot nine over par which is not brilliant but actually the real problem

82
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:52,200
 was she was really nervous because there was loads of TV coverage about it, loads of press

83
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:57,240
 about it that she was pregnant and doing this and in actual fact she had her worst holes

84
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:01,680
 at the start of the round and after the contractions on the 11th hole she was level par for the

85
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:02,680
 rest of the round.

86
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:05,200
 So her game improved after that happened.

87
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,640
 Are we crediting her daughter with that?

88
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:09,640
 You know, her daughter got started getting involved, was like listen I'm going to be

89
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:10,640
 a pro.

90
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:14,120
 I think that might be right because she is amazing, she's such a great golfer.

91
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:19,600
 So Fenella had three planned C sections but we all must, you know, you three must remember

92
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,600
 the moment of the first contraction.

93
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,680
 What were you doing and do you think your child will become that thing?

94
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:25,680
 Lydia.

95
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:32,840
 Well, I was sleeping and if my daughter could start sleeping a little bit better than she

96
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:35,680
 currently is, that would be great.

97
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:36,680
 That's amazing.

98
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:38,680
 Yeah, I think I was as well.

99
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,400
 I was having a cup of tea.

100
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:46,240
 I was having a morning cup of tea in the garden so a professional tea plantation owner is

101
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,320
 what I'm schooling my daughter to be.

102
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,920
 We were watching the Super Bowl when my wife's...

103
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:51,920
 Oh, that's much cooler.

104
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:52,920
 Here we go.

105
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:53,920
 What?

106
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:54,920
 No, that's great.

107
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:58,840
 So my daughter's going to be a tight end for the Pittsburgh Steelers.

108
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:02,920
 Or a slouch who just watches TV at home.

109
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:07,120
 So it turns out Brenda's daughter might have actually helped because during pregnancy the

110
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:14,160
 fetus and the mother share cells and once the baby's born they leave some of their DNA

111
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,160
 in the mother.

112
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:20,800
 It's called Fetometernal Microchimerism and as a result for mothers who have sons, male

113
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:27,600
 DNA has been found in mothers up to 30 years after the birth and it also works that if

114
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:33,320
 the mother sustains organ damage while they're pregnant, the fetus can send cells, not consciously

115
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:36,960
 obviously, but send cells to repair the damaged organ.

116
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,160
 So maybe by sending golfing cells.

117
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:42,680
 The golf cells, have they identified yet the golfing cells?

118
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:46,160
 They have identified golf cells, they're very round.

119
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:50,880
 They're a little dimpled in them, okay.

120
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:55,640
 And just to finish up on their family, Rachel Keane's grandparents were also golfers on

121
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:56,640
 her mother's side.

122
00:06:56,640 --> 00:07:02,500
 Her grandfather Jack played for Venezuela in the first World Amateur Team Championships

123
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:07,040
 in St Andrews and her grandmother Carmen was the captain of the Dominican team in the

124
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:09,960
 World Amateurs in 1986.

125
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:13,800
 So it is definitely in the genes.

126
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,680
 It's not allowed on golf courses, just to say.

127
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:16,680
 Are they not?

128
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:19,640
 It's endlessly fascinating golf.

129
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:26,120
 Okay, so if you are one of the people who was fast forwarding to not hear any golf,

130
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,920
 you can come back into the room right now.

131
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:28,920
 I can't promise that.

132
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:31,480
 I can't guarantee I won't ask again.

133
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:36,560
 But then if you have absolutely no interest in pregnancy, maybe fast forward another 15

134
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,560
 minutes or so.

135
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:41,840
 And then if you're not interested in yetis, probably another 15 minutes.

136
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:42,840
 Probably a couple of years.

137
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:45,840
 Yeah, people do do incredible things while pregnant.

138
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:49,160
 Something that I think is often played down is when people do stuff in first trimester

139
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:52,120
 pregnancy, you get all the sympathy when you're massive.

140
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:55,280
 And personally, my experience is that's fine.

141
00:07:55,280 --> 00:08:00,280
 You know, I was bounding up steps carrying a bike, but first trimester is living hell

142
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:02,840
 for a lot of women, I think.

143
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:03,840
 With morning sicknesses.

144
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,320
 With morning sickness, basically.

145
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:09,400
 So for instance, I was reading about someone who won the Mount Everest Marathon.

146
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,880
 And I didn't know this existed, actually.

147
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:11,880
 Is it?

148
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:12,880
 Do you start at the top?

149
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:13,880
 Because that's the one I would like to do.

150
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:16,920
 Yeah, and then you sit on a sledge.

151
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:19,160
 You don't even encompass the top, which seems a shame.

152
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:22,400
 You start at base camp at 17,500 feet.

153
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,600
 That's pretty high.

154
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,120
 And you sort of run about.

155
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:31,240
 And it was won in 2013 by Ang Dami Sherpa, Sherpa lady, who was 44 at the time and three

156
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,720
 months pregnant.

157
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,560
 And she won the women's race.

158
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:38,440
 And I think if you've got bad morning sickness, that's much harder than winning it at eight

159
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:39,440
 months pregnant.

160
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,440
 Oh yeah.

161
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,560
 And you're tired as well.

162
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:46,360
 And you can't tell anybody, so you just have to persist through 12 weeks of pretending

163
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,360
 you're fine.

164
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,360
 Yeah.

165
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:50,520
 And I was just going, God, you've got crap at this, haven't you?

166
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:53,360
 You suck at Mount Everest marathons.

167
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,360
 What's going on?

168
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,360
 Anyway, well done, her.

169
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,360
 Ang Dami Sherpa.

170
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,360
 That was the point.

171
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,360
 Yeah.

172
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:01,120
 There's a lot of debate and anger over the years about what happens when people get pregnant

173
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:03,200
 and how workplaces deal with them.

174
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,240
 And opera has this quite a lot.

175
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:08,880
 And there's an interesting thing with opera that for certain plays, like Wagner plays,

176
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:12,760
 there's a lot of flying in Wagner plays, so they don't feel safe.

177
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,800
 Humans can't do that anyway.

178
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:18,760
 But you're on, you're on, you know, the, the pulley systems and the wires.

179
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:20,680
 And so they say you can't do that.

180
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:21,680
 That's not the thing.

181
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,160
 If you're a valkyrie, you mean?

182
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,160
 Yeah.

183
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,160
 Exactly.

184
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:26,160
 Yeah.

185
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,680
 But one of the major things as well is that your voice changes.

186
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:34,560
 And I don't know if either of you two sing and then have noticed post-birth of your child.

187
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:37,400
 I've never heard that a thing I don't think in my entire life.

188
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:38,400
 That's a real shame.

189
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:41,320
 I sing a lot, but mostly in private, which I think is for the best.

190
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,320
 Yeah.

191
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,320
 Right.

192
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:45,080
 You said to me the other day you thought my voice had changed.

193
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,080
 Oh.

194
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,480
 You said, you said I sounded husky.

195
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:49,400
 You did sound husky, but I thought that was because you had a cold.

196
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:50,400
 No, but I didn't.

197
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:52,920
 But then you just say it's because, yeah, you, it's just got, it's got husky.

198
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:53,920
 Yeah.

199
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:56,720
 You're just smoking 30 a day, aren't you?

200
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:57,720
 Yeah.

201
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:58,720
 This is, this is a genuine thing.

202
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:01,800
 And the science is not fully understood at the moment, so they're looking into it.

203
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:06,320
 But they say after the, after childbirth, voices of opera singers often become enriched

204
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:09,760
 with warmth, creaminess and depth of color.

205
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:13,040
 As I say, the science is not really strong on this at the moment.

206
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,040
 Creaminess.

207
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,040
 Creaminess.

208
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:17,480
 But, um, yeah, there's a, so there's a guy called Paul Quack.

209
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:19,040
 Again, that's not a good.

210
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,440
 You're joking.

211
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,440
 You're joking.

212
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:27,640
 I didn't notice that until now, Dr. Quack, an ENG specialist.

213
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:29,440
 A snake-hole specialist.

214
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:33,360
 He said that, I've got to check that this is not an April first.

215
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:38,960
 He said, you're so good at that noise.

216
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:43,520
 I feel like you've done it a disproportionate number of times over the years, showing it

217
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:44,520
 off.

218
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:45,520
 Yeah.

219
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:48,640
 He says they're affected by the hypervascular state of the body that it enters to in pregnancy.

220
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:52,360
 It creates more blood vessels and increases blood flow through the tissue.

221
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,440
 And as a result, it changes the voice.

222
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:55,440
 So, yeah.

223
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:59,520
 It definitely does seem to be true that voices get sort of better in, and this is during

224
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:01,200
 pregnancy for opera singers.

225
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:04,640
 And it's because there's that, you know, women have almost 50% more blood at the time.

226
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:09,120
 But they say they're particularly good at the apoggio technique, which is, I didn't

227
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,240
 know about, apparently this is crucial in opera.

228
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:15,200
 And it's where you basically exhale while leaving your ribs open.

229
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:18,400
 I spent about an hour trying to do this when I read about this yesterday.

230
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:22,480
 And that makes you a really good singer, or it's going to make James pass out.

231
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,800
 How do you open your ribs?

232
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:28,280
 Yeah, you need some equipment, actually.

233
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:32,880
 But they also said that the baby acts like a corset, which you can push against.

234
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:37,160
 So the baby is pushing up against your diaphragm, and you kind of use that pressure to push

235
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:38,160
 up against it.

236
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:42,120
 And one opera singer, Katherine Lewick, said that in the second trimester, she felt like

237
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,720
 she was performing on steroids.

238
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:46,160
 High notes just came shooting out of me.

239
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:48,800
 That's amazing.

240
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:53,960
 On singers and singing, do you guys know about Effeni Shakur?

241
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:54,960
 Effeni Shakur.

242
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,600
 She related to Tupac Shakur?

243
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,160
 She is indeed his mother.

244
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,160
 Oh, God.

245
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:01,080
 Look at my cool music knowledge.

246
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:05,160
 Do you listen to her albums as a person it is?

247
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:07,840
 Huge fan of all of Tupac's family's albums.

248
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:12,280
 She was a member of the Black Panthers, and she was arrested and charged with counts

249
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:17,680
 of conspiracy to bomb police stations while she was pregnant with Tupac.

250
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:22,560
 And she represented herself in court and got an undercover cop to admit under oath that

251
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:27,880
 he and the other agents had basically organized all the unlawful stuff.

252
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:32,160
 And they were kind of undercover cops, but they were trying to get them to do things

253
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:38,960
 that were illegal, and then they all got acquitted in May 1971, and then she gave birth to Tupac

254
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:39,960
 in June.

255
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:40,960
 Nice.

256
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:44,520
 So like less than a month later, so she was eight months pregnant when she was doing that

257
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:45,520
 stuff in court.

258
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:46,520
 Wow.

259
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:47,520
 That's pretty cool.

260
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:48,520
 Good timing.

261
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:49,520
 We're all doing, I learned this fact from Jay-Z.

262
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:53,520
 Oh, sorry, is that a name drop?

263
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:55,120
 You're just hanging out with Jay-Z, Leslie?

264
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:59,000
 Yeah, me and Jay, we're hanging out, and no, he did this interview where he stops the

265
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:04,400
 interview and he says, "You white people, you all do white people pronunciation of Tupac's

266
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:05,400
 name.

267
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:06,400
 It's Tupac, not Tupac."

268
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:11,720
 No, I know Tupac, but when I try to say Tupac, it sounds like I'm a posh person saying that.

269
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:16,800
 So it's like, I'm really sorry, people who are actual fans who say Tupac, but we can't

270
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:17,800
 get away with it.

271
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:21,720
 So I know it's Tupac, but I say Tupac because I'm from the north of England.

272
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:22,720
 Exactly.

273
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:23,720
 There's a lot of qualifier.

274
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:27,320
 That's why I told Jay-Z, I said, "Have you been to the north?"

275
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:28,320
 It's how they say it there.

276
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:33,200
 You mean Jay-Z, right?

277
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:36,920
 Another person who had a tough time during pregnancy was Thomas Beattie.

278
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:37,920
 Thomas Beattie.

279
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:38,920
 Nice.

280
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:39,920
 Remember Thomas Beattie?

281
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,760
 Is that the transgender man who gave birth?

282
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:42,760
 Absolutely.

283
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:46,080
 In 2010, got the Guinness World Record for being the world's first married man to give

284
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:47,080
 birth.

285
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:51,600
 He was a transgender man who was partway through gender reassignment surgery.

286
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:55,200
 Not, I mean, not literally partway through at the time, right?

287
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,320
 Step back, step back.

288
00:13:57,320 --> 00:14:01,120
 Had some parts of it, not other parts.

289
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:05,760
 He says people's attitudes have improved since 2008, but only slightly.

290
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:09,440
 Back then it was 99.99999% terrible.

291
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:12,200
 Today, it's probably only 95% terrible.

292
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:15,760
 But a few interesting things about Thomas Beattie, because people will remember that

293
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:20,240
 story, I reckon, who are listening to this, because he was quite famous at the time.

294
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:23,640
 But his fifth great-grandfather was William Henry Harrison.

295
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:24,640
 Whoa!

296
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:25,640
 Really?

297
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:26,640
 The ninth president.

298
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:27,640
 Really?

299
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:28,640
 Yeah.

300
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:32,080
 And his third great-uncle was Benjamin Harrison, who was another president.

301
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,080
 Wow.

302
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:36,000
 We're getting a lot of great descendant of president energy in recent shows.

303
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
 You know what?

304
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
 I was thinking exactly the same thing.

305
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:44,200
 So, his third great-uncle was Benjamin Harrison, and Lydia, you'll know this, Benjamin Harrison

306
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:47,240
 was what, the 23rd was he?

307
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:49,720
 And there was someone who was twice, who's the person who was...

308
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:50,720
 Cleveland.

309
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:51,720
 Cleveland, yeah.

310
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:54,600
 Grover Cleveland was president twice on either side of him.

311
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:57,960
 And Grover Cleveland was the person who we mentioned the other day.

312
00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:01,560
 Yeah, because he was the grandfather...

313
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:02,960
 Of the trolley problem.

314
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:03,960
 The woman...

315
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:04,960
 Philippa Foote.

316
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:05,960
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

317
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:07,680
 Yeah, the creator of the trolley problem.

318
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:13,280
 But anyway, Thomas Beattie was also in the vastly superior French version of Big Brother,

319
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:16,560
 which we mentioned before, I think, where every participant has to have a secret.

320
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,320
 Do you remember that?

321
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,320
 No.

322
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,320
 No.

323
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:23,120
 So, in French Big Brother, you go in and you also have a secret, and there's a secondary

324
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:26,320
 part where people have to guess what your secret is.

325
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:31,120
 So while he was on it, another participant had a city in Sri Lanka named after her family,

326
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:33,400
 and another one was the World Car Washing Champion.

327
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:40,240
 But there was one, it was a few years after this, there was one where one of the contestants

328
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,240
 was a dog.

329
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:43,240
 That's an easy one to guess.

330
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:46,000
 No, that wasn't what their secret was.

331
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
 Oh, that's not the secret.

332
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,640
 No, no, that was out in the open.

333
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:49,640
 Sorry, right.

334
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:54,040
 The amazing secret was that they were the mayor of a town in France.

335
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:55,040
 So good.

336
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:58,040
 It's actually ridiculous.

337
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:00,960
 Do you know the leading advocate of natural childbirth?

338
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:04,880
 So in the 20th century, it became common to advocate that, because surgery was becoming

339
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:08,600
 more common and also it was early day surgery, so it was much more dangerous.

340
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:13,120
 And someone, one of the first people to talk about how important it was to promote natural

341
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:16,320
 childbirth was a guy called Grant Lee Dick Reid.

342
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,760
 I just really enjoy his name.

343
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:20,120
 Dick Reid, okay.

344
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:23,800
 Or could be Dick Redd, and I don't know which is what it's because it's Reid, like, read

345
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:24,800
 a book.

346
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:25,800
 R-E-A-D.

347
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:26,800
 Yeah.

348
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:27,800
 Yeah.

349
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:31,960
 I think if it's Redd, there's more open to problems if you say my dick's redd, people

350
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:32,960
 don't know.

351
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:33,960
 Yeah.

352
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:34,960
 Yeah, you're right.

353
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:35,960
 You're right.

354
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:36,960
 People don't know.

355
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:39,320
 People are just currently reading it.

356
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:40,320
 Exactly.

357
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,320
 Yeah.

358
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:42,320
 That was before pictures.

359
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,320
 Dick Reid, right?

360
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:44,320
 He sent me a dick Reid.

361
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:51,920
 It was a 19th century dick pic.

362
00:16:51,920 --> 00:17:01,080
 Okay, it is time for fact number two, and that is Anna.

363
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:05,280
 My fact this week is that for almost a thousand years, Christians have debated whether to

364
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:09,600
 treat the barnacle goose as a barnacle or a goose.

365
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:13,520
 Are we going to argue over it now, or is it being decided?

366
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:18,200
 I think it's too controversial a topic for us to take a stand on which it is, so we can

367
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,720
 just talk about it today in general.

368
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:21,200
 It certainly looks like a goose.

369
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:27,120
 No, it is a goose, obviously, but it's been this very controversial thing for more than

370
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:33,560
 a thousand years, in fact, because when meat is not allowed, usually it's lent or on Fridays,

371
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:38,680
 it's always varied what days you fast in Christianity, depending on time and place and denomination,

372
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:40,840
 but fish tends to be permitted.

373
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:44,920
 And there was this rumour going around in about the 12th century that the barnacle goose

374
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:50,400
 was maybe a fish, maybe a sort of barnacle-y thing, grew for barnacles, so they said maybe

375
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:54,880
 we can eat it, maybe we can't, and across the ages, if you look it up, there are just

376
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:59,240
 constantly people saying, well, the Irish bishops are still doing that thing where they eat

377
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:00,240
 barnacle geese.

378
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:06,040
 I mean, I think Gerald of Wales in 1187 campaigned against it, but acknowledged that they were

379
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:07,600
 probably kind of barnacles.

380
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:12,280
 They grew out of wood, but he still said that's no reason for these bishops in Ireland to

381
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:13,280
 treat them.

382
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:14,280
 Did they not find eggs?

383
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:18,200
 How does anyone think that a goose comes from a barnacle?

384
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:20,760
 Yeah, it's interesting, isn't it?

385
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:27,360
 You've got to suspect they didn't look hard enough, because their reasoning was pretty

386
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:28,960
 weird anyway.

387
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:33,120
 It's essentially that goose barnacles, which are the barnacles that barnacle geese were

388
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:37,960
 thought to have sprouted from, tend to grow on the bottom of bits of wood that are floating

389
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:43,080
 around at sea, and sort of have a goose-like shape-ish, has been the claim.

390
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:46,320
 Kind of white, aren't they, with like a black bit?

391
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,040
 Necky thing, which you might call a neck.

392
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:50,360
 It doesn't have a head attached, which does seem to be a problem, but whatever.

393
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:51,360
 Or any wings.

394
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:52,360
 Or legs.

395
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:53,360
 No.

396
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:54,360
 No.

397
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:56,560
 But they were radius back then.

398
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:57,560
 Sounds like a goose to me.

399
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:58,560
 I mean...

400
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:03,920
 It's true, I think, that the geese would migrate, so they would all disappear, and there'd

401
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:04,920
 be no geese.

402
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:08,920
 And then the geese would come back, and we didn't know that migration was a thing, so

403
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:11,080
 it just seemed like they all disappeared, and then they all came back.

404
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:15,080
 But they all came back about the same time as Driftwood was coming in, with all these

405
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:18,120
 barnacles on them, and stuff like that, I think.

406
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:19,120
 Okay.

407
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:20,120
 Yeah.

408
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:22,680
 I think, basically, the problem was, no one knew what migration was.

409
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:27,360
 All birds disappeared, and then they all came back, and people's kids would be like,

410
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:28,840
 "Why are there no geese?

411
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:29,840
 Yeah.

412
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:30,840
 Why are there no geese in the winter?

413
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:32,280
 Why are they only here in the summer?"

414
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:34,320
 And then people's parents had to make up some bullshit.

415
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,600
 "Oh, you see that tree?

416
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:38,440
 Yeah, they come off the tree.

417
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:39,600
 Now, eat your peas."

418
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,920
 It was much easier to make things up back then.

419
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:45,560
 There was a man called John Gerrard, who actually had a garden here in Hoburn, that he wrote

420
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:50,480
 a book about all the plants that you would find in it, and he said barnacle geese literally

421
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,520
 grew on trees.

422
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:57,040
 And he covered his own back by saying, "Look, I have seen this happen, but in some parts

423
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:58,940
 of the country, it doesn't happen.

424
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:02,320
 So if anybody from another part of England tells you that it doesn't happen, they're

425
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:05,960
 probably telling the truth, but I have seen it happen.

426
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:10,560
 So in the north, they may be speaking their own truth, but I've seen it happen."

427
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:11,560
 Really?

428
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:13,920
 So there's much less science to go on in those days.

429
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:17,400
 After Gerrard's death, one of his friends issued an update to his book with lots of

430
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,400
 corrections.

431
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:19,400
 Oh, really?

432
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:20,400
 Yeah.

433
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,400
 Backchecked it?

434
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,400
 Yeah.

435
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,400
 It's a great idea.

436
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:27,760
 The chance of me outliving you is probably pretty slim, but if I do, I'm going through

437
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,680
 your book with a red pen.

438
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:30,680
 Oh, God.

439
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:34,200
 Jesus, there won't be anything left.

440
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:40,720
 In Ireland, I was reading a few slang terms to do with lent, and Green's slang dictionary

441
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:43,600
 has this thing, which is cock Tuesday.

442
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:44,600
 Cock Tuesday?

443
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:45,600
 Yeah.

444
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:46,600
 Okay.

445
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:49,880
 So it's sort of like in the eve prior to lent, it'd be, I guess, where you would gorge

446
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:50,880
 yourself.

447
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:53,200
 Oh, so what now is pancake day?

448
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,200
 Yeah.

449
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:55,200
 Yeah.

450
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,200
 But it used to be cock Tuesday.

451
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:57,200
 Cock Tuesday.

452
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,200
 Okay.

453
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,200
 Yeah.

454
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,200
 Do we find out why it's cock Tuesday?

455
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:02,720
 Oh, I assumed it was you just ate a lot of meat.

456
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:03,720
 God, I didn't actually...

457
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:08,320
 You ate a lot of meat, so you call it cock Tuesday, because that's the real meat, isn't

458
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:09,320
 it?

459
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:10,320
 You're eating cock.

460
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:11,320
 Cock.

461
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:12,320
 Yeah.

462
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:13,320
 Okay.

463
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:14,320
 Is it not?

464
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:15,320
 I've been eating cock on a Tuesday.

465
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:17,360
 That has never been part of Christian tradition.

466
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:20,160
 I'm pretty sure in the Bible it says you're not allowed to eat cock on a Tuesday.

467
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:21,160
 Right.

468
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:22,160
 I think it's in Leviticus.

469
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:23,160
 Yeah.

470
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:24,160
 You're right.

471
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:25,160
 Yeah, I guess it is that.

472
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:26,160
 Yeah.

473
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,160
 Could have been cock fighting.

474
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,160
 Yeah.

475
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:29,160
 Could have been cock fighting.

476
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:33,720
 In fact, I do happen to know that cock fighting did happen on Shrove Tuesday, actually.

477
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:34,720
 Yeah.

478
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,160
 Because it was banned, wasn't it?

479
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:37,160
 Do you remember?

480
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:38,160
 This is in our book, haven't I?

481
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:39,160
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

482
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:40,160
 I know.

483
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:45,040
 I'll be fact checking that if James dies before me.

484
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:48,320
 I mean, when you read about the history of what you're allowed to eat and drink in lent,

485
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:51,320
 it does give the impression that the Pope has just been inundated throughout time with

486
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:53,760
 some people knocking in his door going, "Can I try this?

487
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,880
 Can I have this?"

488
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:59,560
 This beaver, like beaver is always a famous example that says beaver was classified as

489
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:04,480
 a fish for hundreds of years by the Catholic Church in South America because it swims

490
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:05,480
 a lot.

491
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:08,800
 And yeah, it's always like and they went to the Pope and they said, "Pope, are we allowed

492
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:09,800
 to do this one?"

493
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:11,440
 It's just like they find a new animal.

494
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:12,440
 Yeah.

495
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:13,960
 They're like, "Find a dog bill platypus.

496
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:14,960
 Pope!"

497
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:15,960
 Yeah.

498
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:16,960
 Come and look at this.

499
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:17,960
 Come on, it's in water.

500
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:18,960
 That'd be amazing.

501
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:19,960
 Yeah.

502
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:20,960
 They're like a group of people admins.

503
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:23,440
 They just try to prove or say no to it.

504
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:29,440
 Iguanas was a big one when the Spanish went over to South America because they spent a

505
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:30,560
 lot of time in water.

506
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:33,040
 They said, "Pope, can we eat this?"

507
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:35,040
 And the Pope said, "Yes."

508
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:41,960
 Even though the black iguana was the one that people ate, which was a land iguana, on the

509
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:45,160
 rules that the green one spent time in water.

510
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:47,520
 So iguanas are kind of fishy things.

511
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:48,680
 So it was a double loop.

512
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:49,680
 All right.

513
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:53,480
 Because his cousin sometimes likes to swim, so we'll eat this guy.

514
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:54,480
 Exactly.

515
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:55,480
 Yeah.

516
00:22:55,480 --> 00:23:00,440
 Sometimes the Pope comes out with some suggestions for what you can do during Lent.

517
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:04,840
 2020, what do you think he said to give up for Lent?

518
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:05,840
 Face masks.

519
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:06,840
 Condoms.

520
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:07,840
 Yeah.

521
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:11,840
 It's going to be too hard to do.

522
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:12,840
 Okay.

523
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:13,840
 What could you give up for Lent?

524
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:14,840
 I bet.

525
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:15,840
 No.

526
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:16,840
 They're trying to be cool.

527
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:17,840
 It's 2020.

528
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:18,840
 Yeah.

529
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:20,360
 It's kind of, you're in the right territory.

530
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:21,880
 A lot of people are online, I guess.

531
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:22,880
 They're at home.

532
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:23,880
 Yeah.

533
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:24,880
 It's 2020.

534
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:29,480
 Masterbating online on Zoom with the rest of the monks.

535
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:31,480
 Yeah.

536
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:33,040
 It was very close.

537
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:34,040
 Hashtags.

538
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:35,040
 Hashtags.

539
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:36,040
 No.

540
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:37,040
 Hashtags.

541
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,040
 Look, come on.

542
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:39,040
 We can get this.

543
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:40,040
 You can get it, but it's kind of a boring answer.

544
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:41,040
 A carder.

545
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:44,640
 Is it scheduling Zoom meetings for sort of nine o'clock in the morning?

546
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:45,640
 Oh, yeah.

547
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:46,640
 We'll just get into work.

548
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:47,640
 Okay.

549
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:48,640
 We're in the territory.

550
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:53,720
 Just remember, a lot of people spending time online and online is a very scary place sometimes.

551
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:54,720
 Twitter?

552
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:56,840
 Oh, those online quizzes, they were all over the place.

553
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:57,840
 Yeah.

554
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:01,120
 No, no, it's online comedy shows.

555
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:02,120
 Yeah.

556
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:06,640
 Is it just like take some time out from the internet?

557
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:07,640
 It's trolling.

558
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:08,640
 Oh.

559
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:12,640
 So, take time off from sending negative messages out into the world.

560
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:13,640
 Trolls stop your anger.

561
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:15,920
 That's like saying, don't murder people.

562
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:16,920
 Yeah.

563
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:17,920
 Like, stop doing it, full stop.

564
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:20,920
 And then you can have a massive troll at the end of the day.

565
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:21,920
 Just go online abuse it.

566
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:22,920
 Everyone you can find.

567
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:25,920
 I'll tell you what, on the cock Tuesday, you can all be cocks online.

568
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:26,920
 Yeah, yeah.

569
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:27,920
 That's where it comes from.

570
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:29,920
 That's what he said.

571
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:34,200
 If you all stop just for a month, then the world will be a better place.

572
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:36,920
 And then you can all go back to being fucking losers.

573
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:38,920
 All right, stop now.

574
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:42,920
 Do you guys know about mop eggs?

575
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:43,920
 Mop eggs.

576
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:44,920
 Mop.

577
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:45,920
 Mop eggs, actually.

578
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:46,920
 Mop eggs.

579
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:48,920
 But I want to know also what you think a mop egg would be.

580
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,920
 That sounds fun.

581
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:56,920
 It's a mop egg, an egg, which is pretending to be a mop.

582
00:24:56,920 --> 00:25:00,920
 You're thinking of the mop, mop egg.

583
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:01,920
 Yeah.

584
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:02,920
 Just under the dictionary.

585
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:06,420
 It's something that's not really an egg, because you can't eat eggs over lent.

586
00:25:06,420 --> 00:25:07,420
 Yeah.

587
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:08,920
 But you eat this particular thing instead.

588
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:09,920
 Yes.

589
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:10,920
 Which is...

590
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:12,920
 You can probably guess it.

591
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:13,920
 Okay.

592
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:14,920
 You can't guess it.

593
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:15,920
 I'll take it back.

594
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:16,920
 Hang on.

595
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:17,920
 It's a food.

596
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:18,920
 Oh, is it?

597
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:19,920
 I know what it'll be.

598
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:20,920
 What's the aqua favor?

599
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:22,920
 You are close.

600
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:26,920
 But because, as I think we probably have mentioned, the concept of aqua favor was invented about

601
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:27,920
 four years ago.

602
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:29,920
 And this comes from the 1450s.

603
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:30,920
 It wasn't that.

604
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:34,920
 So, was it something that you can use instead of eggs?

605
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:35,920
 It was something that you used to make.

606
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:39,920
 And it's a recipe for making a mop egg, because you couldn't eat animal products that included

607
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:40,920
 egg.

608
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:44,920
 And it was extremely popular, much more popular than dairy milk throughout medieval times

609
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:45,920
 was almond milk.

610
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:46,920
 Oh, yeah.

611
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:49,920
 And that's partly because you could eat that still in lent.

612
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:51,920
 And so you filled an empty egg shell.

613
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:55,920
 Now, I don't know how you got the egg shell really empty, and then to a place where you

614
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:56,920
 could fill it again.

615
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:57,920
 Oh, just a tiny hole.

616
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:58,920
 Yeah.

617
00:25:58,920 --> 00:25:59,920
 Crick a hole.

618
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:00,920
 One in each end.

619
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:01,920
 And then blow it.

620
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:02,920
 But then you have to fill it up with...

621
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:03,920
 Okay.

622
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:04,920
 Slightly bigger hole.

623
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:05,920
 A little thicker hole.

624
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:06,920
 Okay.

625
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:07,920
 Make a hole in your egg.

626
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:08,920
 Empty it.

627
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:12,920
 So, almond milk based jelly, and then real almonds in the middle dyed yellow with saffron.

628
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:17,920
 So, you've got crunchy almonds in the middle yellow, and then grey almond jelly outside.

629
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:19,920
 And it looks like a shit egg.

630
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:20,920
 Right.

631
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:25,920
 By the way, apparently this is just calling back to the last fact, you shouldn't blow

632
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:28,920
 air up a vagina when someone's pregnant.

633
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:29,920
 That's true.

634
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:34,920
 I mean, honestly, if you're going to do it, ask permission anyway, whether they're pregnant

635
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:35,920
 or not.

636
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:37,920
 Yeah, that is dangerous, isn't it?

637
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:38,920
 I've heard that.

638
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:39,920
 Is it?

639
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:41,920
 Well, actually, you know what?

640
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:42,920
 I've never checked it.

641
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:43,920
 Yeah.

642
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:44,920
 But it's the kind of thing you hear.

643
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:46,920
 It's the kind of thing you hear in the playground.

644
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:47,920
 Really?

645
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:48,920
 Yeah, yeah.

646
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:51,920
 Didn't you hear it went to a cool school?

647
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:55,920
 So, fillet of fish, McDonald's.

648
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:56,920
 Oh, yeah.

649
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:58,920
 Lydia, you and I were talking about this.

650
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:00,920
 Yeah, it's a byproduct of Catholic fasting.

651
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:04,920
 So, it was developed in 1962 by a man called Lou Grun.

652
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:09,920
 He ran the Cincinnati franchise and couldn't sell burgers on Fridays or during Lent because

653
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:11,920
 most of his customers were Catholic.

654
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:15,920
 And so, he came up with this idea of this horrible burger.

655
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:17,920
 Sorry, I'm sure it's great.

656
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:22,920
 And now, a days, about 25% of the fillet of fish is bought by McDonald's customers in

657
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:24,920
 any one year are bought during the 40 days of Lent.

658
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:25,920
 No.

659
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:26,920
 Nobody buys in the rest of the year.

660
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:27,920
 Really?

661
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:28,920
 Yeah.

662
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:29,920
 That's so interesting.

663
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:32,920
 Yeah, I wouldn't have thought there were that many devout Catholics going to McDonald's.

664
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:34,920
 In America, there's loads.

665
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:36,920
 There's some places that don't even sell them outside of Lent.

666
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:38,920
 They just wait for Lent and then they bring it back on the menu.

667
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:39,920
 Really?

668
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:40,920
 That's amazing.

669
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:43,920
 And this guy, Grun, he developed them in 1962.

670
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:47,920
 So, Ray Kroc had taken over McDonald's in '61.

671
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:51,920
 And so, they basically had a competition between them because he, Ray Kroc, had come up with

672
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:56,920
 his own burger at the same time, which was a non-meat burger called the Hula Burger, which

673
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:57,920
 I believe we've mentioned before.

674
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:58,920
 Hula hoops.

675
00:27:58,920 --> 00:27:59,920
 Yeah, it was Hula Hoops.

676
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:02,920
 And it was grilled pineapple with cheese on a cold bun.

677
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:07,920
 And so, he said whoever sells the most will be on the permanent menu after a bit of time

678
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:09,920
 and fill it, oh, fish, one out.

679
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:13,920
 Do you know whether there's more birthday parties than any other McDonald's in the world?

680
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:15,920
 Because I've been there this year.

681
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:17,920
 Oh, he's been there this year.

682
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:19,920
 He's Bolton.

683
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:22,920
 Marrakesh?

684
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:24,920
 No, not Marrakesh.

685
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:25,920
 Montenegro?

686
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:27,920
 Montenegro's close, but not quite right.

687
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:28,920
 Serbia.

688
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:29,920
 Capital.

689
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:30,920
 Belgrade.

690
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:31,920
 Belgrade.

691
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:32,920
 Correct.

692
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:33,920
 St. Belgrade.

693
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:34,920
 Is it?

694
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:35,920
 Yeah.

695
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:39,920
 And it's because basically when McDonald's passed the Iron Curtain, it was just so popular.

696
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:44,920
 I really like watching because both you, Lydia and James are quizzes and you do things like

697
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:45,920
 only connect.

698
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:46,920
 That was like training.

699
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:51,920
 I was going to say, can you edit out the dead air before I remember that Belgrade was the

700
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:52,920
 capital of Serbia?

701
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:56,920
 But Serbia was the place where the Golden Arch's diplomacy rule got broken.

702
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:57,920
 Oh, what's that?

703
00:28:57,920 --> 00:29:01,920
 Oh, so there's a sort of philosophical idea that no two countries with McDonald's had

704
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:03,920
 ever gone to war with each other.

705
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:04,920
 Oh.

706
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:10,920
 Well, this was, I'm not sure how true it ever was, but there was this idea that if a country

707
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:13,920
 has a McDonald's, they probably weren't going to go to war with each other.

708
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:14,920
 Yeah.

709
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:18,920
 And after somebody put it in an academic article a few weeks, NATO bombed Serbia.

710
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:19,920
 Wow.

711
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:22,920
 And so the Golden Arch's rule, if it ever really existed, was broken at that point.

712
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:24,920
 Can I quickly talk about bimicles?

713
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:25,920
 Yeah.

714
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:26,920
 They're enormous penises.

715
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:27,920
 Yes, please.

716
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:28,920
 Always.

717
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:33,920
 So they have the largest penis to body ratio in the world.

718
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:34,920
 Okay.

719
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:40,080
 They, one reason is because they don't move around very much because they just kind of

720
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:45,040
 attached to things, but they do sort of internal copulation.

721
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:51,160
 So if you're stuck where you are, imagine your feet are nailed to the ground and you

722
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:54,960
 want to have sex with someone who's three or four feet away and their feet are nailed

723
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:55,960
 to the ground.

724
00:29:55,960 --> 00:30:00,360
 The only way you're going to do that realistically is with a very long penis.

725
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:02,800
 And so that's what they did.

726
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:03,800
 That's what they've evolved.

727
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:11,440
 We had a great sketch of a married couple barnacles, but there's just a random guy in

728
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:16,960
 between them, just every night he just watches a penis come over the front of him.

729
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:17,960
 Like when you're on an aeroplane.

730
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:18,960
 Yeah.

731
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:22,960
 And they put two of you in like one seat away from each other and sit someone random in

732
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:23,960
 the middle.

733
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:24,960
 Yeah.

734
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,960
 You're just passing multisers to each other.

735
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:31,760
 Well, it's, if you can imagine that with penises and barnacles, then that's what happens.

736
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:37,040
 But very recently they found out that Gooseneck barnacles, which I'm not sure if it's the same

737
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:44,480
 as the, these ones, but I think it might be, they do something called sperm casting, which

738
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:48,320
 isn't a new podcast.

739
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:53,520
 It's where you ejaculate into the water and the water sort of finds its way to a, to a

740
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:54,520
 female.

741
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:55,520
 Yeah.

742
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:56,520
 That sounds sensible.

743
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:57,520
 That's a good way of doing it.

744
00:30:57,520 --> 00:31:01,720
 But what the result is that they have evolved much shorter and less stretchy penises.

745
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:06,000
 Oh no, less stretchy as well.

746
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
 So that's what happens.

747
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:10,920
 They've, they've kind of come up with this new way of mating, but at the expense of their

748
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:11,920
 penis stretchiness.

749
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:12,920
 Oh no.

750
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:13,920
 Poor them.

751
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:16,840
 A stretchiness kind of, I, to stretch something, I imagine someone has to be pulling at the

752
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:20,040
 other end and they had to get a fish and be like, can you come over here?

753
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:21,040
 Sorry.

754
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:22,040
 I just want to get this to that girl over there.

755
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:23,040
 Can you just swim it over?

756
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:24,040
 That won't reach.

757
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:25,040
 I promise it will.

758
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:33,480
 We've actually never mentioned the essential role that barnacles played in Britain's kind

759
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:35,040
 of historic reputation.

760
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:41,000
 And basically us ruling the waves was really down to barnacles, or specifically down to

761
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:45,000
 our defeating them, because they're such a huge problem for ships.

762
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:50,360
 So they glue themselves with this really powerful glue to the hulls of ships, and it means that

763
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:55,600
 ships need to use a huge amount more fuel, up to 40% more fuel, just to get going with

764
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:56,600
 a huge weight and drama.

765
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:58,720
 Oh, so it's the weights, right.

766
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:03,880
 It's called biofouling, and it's, it's a huge problem, it's not just a word, James

767
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:04,880
 Goodson.

768
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:05,880
 Good word.

769
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:06,880
 It's a great word.

770
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:07,880
 Biofouling.

771
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:12,720
 They biofoul, and in the 18th century, it was the British who realized that if you sheath

772
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:18,040
 your hulls in copper, the barnacles can't adhere to it, don't adhere to it.

773
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:21,640
 And that was completely revolutionary, and that was what made Britain this naval superpower,

774
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:23,720
 one of the essential things.

775
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:30,080
 But it is a problem again now, because we stopped making boats out of copper, and they're back.

776
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:34,840
 But I do wonder if that's why blistering barnacles is an expletive at sea.

777
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:35,840
 In Tintin.

778
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:36,840
 In Tintin.

779
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:37,840
 Not sure.

780
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:45,760
 In one very specific Belgian kid's comic book.

781
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:52,120
 Okay, it is time for fact number three, and that is my fact.

782
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:57,560
 My fact this week is that just after the Titanic hit the iceberg, many of the first class passengers

783
00:32:57,560 --> 00:33:02,840
 sprung into action and immediately organized snowball fights for the next morning.

784
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:03,840
 Wow.

785
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:04,840
 Yeah.

786
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:05,840
 Yeah.

787
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:10,960
 I mean, just to sort of show how non-threatening they thought the moment was, I found this

788
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:12,920
 fact in a really bizarre place.

789
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:17,000
 I'm reading a book at the moment called "Poking the Dead Frog", which is by a guy called

790
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,000
 Mike Sackwack.

791
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:24,480
 No, it's by Mike Sacks, who's it's an amazing book.

792
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:27,800
 If you're into comedy history, it's interviews with great comedy writers.

793
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:32,200
 And it was within an interview with a guy called Henry Beard, who started National Lampoon.

794
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:35,280
 He was part of and board of the rings, the first Lord of the Rings parody.

795
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:36,280
 It's just in there.

796
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:40,760
 He just says my dad was friends with a guy called Lawrence Beasley, and he was a survivor

797
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:42,320
 of the Titanic.

798
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:47,080
 And then there's a footnote that tells that in an account given in Lawrence Beasley's

799
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:53,360
 book, which is titled "Blistering Barnacles, the Lost".

800
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:54,360
 See.

801
00:33:54,360 --> 00:34:00,400
 So it's called "The loss of the Titanic", it's the sort of real downer of a reveal

802
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:01,400
 of the actual title.

803
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:03,480
 Yeah, you missed the trick there, sort of thing.

804
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:08,800
 The loss of the SS Titanic, its story and its lessons by one of the survivors.

805
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:13,360
 And yeah, he said that as soon as the hit occurred, to illustrate further how little

806
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:17,520
 danger was apprehended, when it was discovered on the first class deck that the forward lower

807
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:21,880
 deck was covered with small ice, snowballing matches were arranged for the following morning,

808
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:25,880
 and some passengers even went down to the deck and brought back small pieces of ice which

809
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:26,880
 were handed round.

810
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:29,120
 Okay, so question.

811
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:33,160
 These are presumably bits of iceberg that have fallen on their deck.

812
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:38,360
 Snowball fights, to me, is safer at least if you use snow rather than ice.

813
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:39,360
 Yes.

814
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:42,360
 Yeah, you always get annoyed with the person who picks up a chunk of ice, and there's

815
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:44,160
 always one kid who throws it.

816
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:45,360
 I actually was thinking about that as well.

817
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:51,840
 I think possibly what happened is that the ice was almost grated, so lots of powder,

818
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:54,320
 as it were, was coming down.

819
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:55,560
 Like a frozen martini.

820
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:56,560
 Exactly.

821
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:57,560
 Yeah.

822
00:34:57,560 --> 00:35:02,560
 And a lot of the other passengers planned the frozen martini party for the next morning.

823
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:03,560
 That's interesting.

824
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:08,040
 Yeah, I think it definitely was shaving, because actually at the time, according to the newspaper

825
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:13,360
 reports from the next day, they said the deck was filled with ice and snow, which had been

826
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:18,040
 shaved off, and passengers were amusing themselves by throwing them around at each other immediately.

827
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:19,040
 Yeah, exactly.

828
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:23,480
 I heard playing football as well with the snow, with the ice, like lumps of ice kicking

829
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:24,480
 it at each other.

830
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:25,480
 Just sliding it along, yeah.

831
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:31,000
 And there was a stoker called Walter Hurst, and I read that he entered some fellow stoker's

832
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:34,240
 cabin and threw lumps of ice at them to wake them up.

833
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:38,040
 So Lawrence Beasley, we've kind of mentioned him on the show before in passing.

834
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:41,080
 He was, we talked about survivor guilt.

835
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:46,440
 A lot of the people that survived the Titanic believed that maybe, particularly if they

836
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:51,120
 were male, I think almost, really almost exclusively if they were male, they should have gone down

837
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:52,120
 with it.

838
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:55,800
 Lawrence Beasley survived because he was standing on the side where the last boats were going

839
00:35:55,800 --> 00:36:00,560
 down, and a rumour went round that they were now taking men off the boat on the other side

840
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:01,560
 of the Titanic.

841
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:04,240
 So everyone ran around, but he just hung out there.

842
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:05,240
 He just didn't go.

843
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:07,160
 This is his story.

844
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:09,960
 And then they said there's more space as you could get in.

845
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:14,360
 So he jumped in that one, and that's how he survived, not knowing that that was a lie,

846
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:16,960
 that there weren't any other on the other side.

847
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:21,440
 And so he survives, and he had survivor's guilt a bit to the point where he jumped onto

848
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:25,400
 the set of a movie of the Titanic that was being filmed.

849
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:29,040
 And he tried to symbolically go down with the iceberg.

850
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:31,040
 Nope, not the same mate.

851
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:32,040
 Sorry.

852
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:36,200
 Yeah, he was a lot of, a lot of, and he got caught.

853
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:37,200
 They kicked him off the set.

854
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:39,160
 So he survived that Titanic.

855
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:45,400
 Yeah, his grandson talks about the fact that it was a thing back then more so, he says

856
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:50,160
 more so than any other time where it was women and children first was not just like a thing,

857
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:51,160
 a suggestion.

858
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:52,160
 It was built into you.

859
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:56,640
 I read that it was quite controversial, even during and immediately after the sinking,

860
00:36:56,640 --> 00:37:01,160
 this women and children idea, because the men obviously were the breadwinners.

861
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:04,720
 They brought home all the resources, so if you didn't bring your husband with you onto

862
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:07,920
 the boat, then you would be poor and destitute.

863
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:12,160
 So there was some arguing amongst survivors and people trying to get off the boat about

864
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:15,800
 whether it should be, should the men be left on the boat and leave the women and children

865
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:16,800
 destitute?

866
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:17,800
 What's better?

867
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:22,280
 And they said, it's not women and children first as the law of the sea, but it is inherent

868
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:23,880
 law of human nature.

869
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:24,880
 Okay.

870
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:25,880
 Interesting.

871
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:30,960
 So they should have done a sort of like, means, or an IQ test or something to see who

872
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:31,960
 are the most useful breadwinners.

873
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:35,480
 Some sort of mean tested survival, I'm sure would have been completely straightforward.

874
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:36,480
 A quick quiz.

875
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:37,480
 A quick quiz, Lydia.

876
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:38,480
 Yes, quiz.

877
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:39,480
 Yeah, quiz.

878
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:40,480
 That sounds good.

879
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:42,800
 If you can name a capital of Serbia, you are.

880
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:43,800
 Capital of Zagreb.

881
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:44,800
 Damn it.

882
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:45,800
 Capital of Zagreb.

883
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:46,800
 Sorry about going down, Dan.

884
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:47,800
 Just throw yourself over.

885
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:48,800
 I was panicking.

886
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:54,040
 I put myself as survival mode.

887
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:58,600
 Interesting little connection between this guy as well, Beasley, is that his son Alec

888
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:04,160
 was married to a writer called Dodie Smith and she's who wrote 101 Dalmatians.

889
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:05,160
 Really?

890
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:10,640
 Yeah, just a little, it's no presidential connection, but it's pretty good going.

891
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:15,200
 Speaking of people with survivors guilt, another one was a person who is the coward of the

892
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:16,200
 Titanic.

893
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:18,840
 So who do you guys think of as the coward of this whole story?

894
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:19,840
 Isme?

895
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:20,840
 Isme?

896
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:21,840
 Billy Zeg.

897
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:22,840
 Exactly.

898
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:23,840
 Okay.

899
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:28,360
 Lydia's is historically accurate, yours is based on the film, so I'm going to go with

900
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:29,360
 Isme.

901
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:32,160
 Yeah, Bruce Isme, who was the head of White Star Line, who was the guy who apparently

902
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:35,760
 or expected to encourage them to keep the ship going faster so they could make the morning

903
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:36,760
 headlines.

904
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:41,840
 You know, and in all adaptations of Titanic, he is the villain, the Panto villain, because

905
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:47,560
 he kind of was the reason it crashed and then he escaped onto a lifeboat, snuck onto a lifeboat.

906
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:51,000
 And he's not, and I just feel like he should be rehabilitated.

907
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:56,680
 So the reason that he's this pantomime villain still today is because William Randolph Hearst,

908
00:38:56,680 --> 00:39:00,680
 who owned all the newspapers at the time, they were influential, just hated him.

909
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:07,160
 Isme was this quite cold, awkward Brit, Hearst was the American guy, and he just ran this

910
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:10,600
 smear campaign almost immediately after the Titanic sank.

911
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:14,640
 He made his papers publish the suggestion that the emblem of White Star be changed to

912
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:19,240
 yellow liver in, you know, testament to his cowardice.

913
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:21,600
 And actually he, we have no evidence that he did that.

914
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:23,720
 It was reported that he did his duty completely.

915
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:29,560
 He was on the very last lifeboat to leave and, come on, it's the driver, the captain.

916
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:30,560
 Where was he in all this?

917
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:33,160
 He was hiding away in that room that exploded with water.

918
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:34,160
 Is it?

919
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:37,440
 I haven't seen any of the movies, but it seems to me like the bad guy would be the iceberg.

920
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:38,440
 Is that not?

921
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:41,520
 The iceberg was just doing its duty, James.

922
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:42,520
 Oh, is it?

923
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:45,200
 Yeah, it's what it was born to do, sink ships.

924
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:48,760
 So a lot of people went to testify about what the experience was, just so we could get it

925
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:52,800
 down in history books, and people were trying to get money from the company as well for

926
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,160
 the disaster.

927
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:58,880
 And one woman, basically, it reads like the worst trip advisor review ever.

928
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:02,880
 It's just her, it's like, it takes ages for her to get to the actual incident itself.

929
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:06,080
 Like the food was shit, the gym wasn't big enough.

930
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:10,200
 We were put into a third-class room, we should have been in a different room, it was barely

931
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:13,960
 enough room to get two people in there, let alone the three people that we had, the meals

932
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:15,680
 were not being served correctly.

933
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:19,000
 But then she does make this point that when they did hit, she sent her son off.

934
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,360
 Sorry, did she actually complain about stuff before?

935
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:22,360
 Genuinely.

936
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:23,360
 Wow.

937
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:26,360
 That's what I mean, it's like a huge long, yeah, yeah, it's a proper trip advisor, two

938
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:27,360
 stars.

939
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:28,360
 That's so funny.

940
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:29,360
 Two stars?

941
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:30,360
 Really?

942
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:31,840
 What does it have to do to get one study?

943
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:36,400
 But she then also, she says that her son goes up, finds the captain, and he's in a card

944
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:37,640
 game and he laughs it off.

945
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:40,240
 He says, "Oh, this is nothing," and she goes back there.

946
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:44,360
 Then it goes to complaints about her going, "The boat that we were put down in, the life

947
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:48,040
 raft, that was a nightmare, get it into that, the lowering of it, they didn't know what

948
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:49,040
 they were doing.

949
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:51,640
 It was on the boat on top of us, almost crashed into us."

950
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:56,760
 To be fair, you're putting a lot of tone on this, that maybe one of the guys was in

951
00:40:56,760 --> 00:41:01,360
 one of those reviews that had the Plasagg response from White Star Line saying, "Well,

952
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:05,360
 you paid for the first class ticket, we will acknowledge we hit the iceberg."

953
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:11,560
 Yeah, thank you for your feedback, we relish any kind of feedback that we get for any of

954
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:12,560
 our liners.

955
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:13,560
 So funny.

956
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:15,600
 Have you heard of a woman named Violet Jessup?

957
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:16,920
 Violet Jessup, no.

958
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:22,920
 She survived the sinking of not only the Titanic, but also the Britannic in 1916, and she was

959
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:27,640
 aboard the third sister ship, the Olympic, when it collided with another boat and nearly

960
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:30,480
 sank in 1911.

961
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:35,480
 And she later wrote a memoir where she complained that after the Titanic sank, she got the

962
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:39,440
 mick taken out of her because she couldn't find a toothbrush, and she was complaining

963
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:43,760
 all the time about not having a toothbrush, and so the other survivors just started making

964
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:44,760
 fun of her.

965
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:46,160
 Hang on, when the Titanic was sinking?

966
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:49,920
 After she was on the ship, after it was the Carpathia, she'd forgotten to take her toothbrush

967
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:53,720
 with her, and so she just kept complaining that nobody would give her a toothbrush.

968
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:58,400
 So when the Britannic sank later, the first thing she did when it started sinking was

969
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:02,600
 she ran to get her toothbrush because she said a friend had told her, "Never undertake

970
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:05,560
 another disaster without first making sure of your toothbrush."

971
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:08,640
 Wow, I can't believe that's the lesson she took away from being on the Titanic because

972
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:09,640
 it sank.

973
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:12,280
 That's mainly what she talks about.

974
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:15,680
 Because she's thought, well, what I'm going to do is make sure I bring a toothbrush next

975
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:19,920
 time, whereas what I might think is don't get on a massive fucking ship.

976
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:23,920
 Being an ick.

977
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:27,160
 Do you guys know who the original captain of the Titanic was?

978
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:30,560
 The original captain, as in not the one who then was the captain?

979
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:31,560
 No, so Smith.

980
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:32,560
 Edward Smith?

981
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:36,360
 Edward Smith was the captain when it was sailing, but actually when it was being assembled

982
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:37,360
 in Belfast.

983
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:38,360
 Okay.

984
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:41,080
 I'm just thinking it's quite an easy job to be a captain of a ship while it's being

985
00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:42,080
 built.

986
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:43,080
 Yeah.

987
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:44,640
 Most of the work does come in once it's at the sea.

988
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:48,040
 Oh, it's a common misconception, actually the hardest part is standing there watching

989
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:49,040
 it being built.

990
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:55,560
 No, I had a master in Belfast who was largely responsible for assembling the crew together

991
00:42:55,560 --> 00:42:58,680
 to get it to Southampton where it went off to.

992
00:42:58,680 --> 00:43:00,920
 So he captained it to Southampton, is that what you're saying?

993
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:01,920
 He actually didn't.

994
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:02,920
 He just got the crew together.

995
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:03,920
 Okay.

996
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:08,040
 But he was officially captain of the Titanic, and he was captain Hadek.

997
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:09,040
 Blistering barnacles.

998
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:11,040
 Are you kidding me?

999
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:14,040
 Captain Herbert Hadek.

1000
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:18,040
 The first captain of the Titanic.

1001
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:20,720
 Isn't that quite bizarre?

1002
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:21,720
 That is something.

1003
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:23,040
 Well, isn't that incredibly famous?

1004
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:26,040
 What a shame he didn't take it all the way to the end.

1005
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:28,560
 Do you know the link between Titanic and North Korea?

1006
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:29,560
 Oh, is it?

1007
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:31,560
 I feel like you might know.

1008
00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:35,440
 Both had a McDonald's, and is it a white star?

1009
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:36,440
 No.

1010
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:43,720
 The HMS Titanic sank on the same day that Kim Il-sung was born, which is April 15, 1912.

1011
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:44,720
 You're right.

1012
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:45,720
 I do know.

1013
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:46,720
 Yes.

1014
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:47,720
 The birthdays of all dictators.

1015
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:48,720
 Well, it just seems like you're a quiz-er.

1016
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:50,720
 It's the kind of thing that comes up.

1017
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:54,720
 I feel like that he has just declared war on this day.

1018
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:55,720
 Right!

1019
00:43:55,720 --> 00:44:00,720
 The QI Festival of Democracy has been broken.

1020
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:01,720
 Oh, yeah.

1021
00:44:01,720 --> 00:44:04,720
 So the North Korean calendar starts from April 15, 1912.

1022
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:05,720
 Yeah, yeah.

1023
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:06,720
 I know all this.

1024
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:07,720
 Come on.

1025
00:44:07,720 --> 00:44:10,720
 Tell me something I don't know.

1026
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:13,720
 But for a crana.

1027
00:44:13,720 --> 00:44:15,020
 No, I do know that.

1028
00:44:15,020 --> 00:44:16,720
 They start with his birth, don't they?

1029
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:17,720
 Yes, they start with his birth.

1030
00:44:17,720 --> 00:44:23,280
 And I tried to find out what time he was born, because obviously it sank in the Atlantic,

1031
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:27,520
 and Korea is, I don't know what time zones were like in 1912, but several hours ahead

1032
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:31,720
 said it could possibly have been born at the moment of the sinking.

1033
00:44:31,720 --> 00:44:33,520
 Do you think there's a connection?

1034
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:35,720
 I do, but I'm not going to go into it here.

1035
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:36,720
 What was that?

1036
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:39,720
 Get on Dan's other podcast.

1037
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:42,720
 Can I just quickly, very, very quickly say that in 19...

1038
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:50,720
 There was a 1962 law in the town of Owasau in America, which banned children from throwing

1039
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:52,720
 snowballs at each other.

1040
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:53,720
 Why?

1041
00:44:53,720 --> 00:44:54,720
 Because it hurts.

1042
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:58,720
 And I think the idea was that, you know, it stopped protesters and stuff, but effectively

1043
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:00,720
 it stopped people from throwing snowballs.

1044
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:02,720
 And they eventually changed the rule.

1045
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:07,720
 But what happened was that people heard about this law and they got very, very upset about

1046
00:45:07,720 --> 00:45:12,720
 it and started sort of trolling the city and saying, how come you're stopping kids from

1047
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:13,720
 throwing snowballs?

1048
00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:15,720
 It's disgusting.

1049
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:20,720
 And one of the people who's in charge said that the nastiness of it has been incredible.

1050
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:25,720
 We haven't seen as much unexpected vitriol since we cracked down on kids selling ice cream

1051
00:45:25,720 --> 00:45:28,720
 off their backs.

1052
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:31,720
 To be honest, they do sound like the bad guys.

1053
00:45:31,720 --> 00:45:36,720
 In the American Civil War, massive organized snowball fights used to happen quite regularly.

1054
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:38,720
 Between just the same side?

1055
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:39,720
 Same side.

1056
00:45:39,720 --> 00:45:44,720
 But it would be, it was usually among the Confederate troops and it would be between different regiments.

1057
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:48,720
 So there was one in 1864 where 20,000 troops took part.

1058
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:53,720
 There were 10,000 on the Georgian and South Carolina side and 10,000 on the Tennessee side.

1059
00:45:53,720 --> 00:45:54,720
 What?

1060
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:55,720
 Yeah.

1061
00:45:55,720 --> 00:45:56,720
 Yeah.

1062
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:57,720
 They were crazy.

1063
00:45:57,720 --> 00:45:59,720
 That's a lot of people for a snowball fight.

1064
00:45:59,720 --> 00:46:00,720
 Yeah.

1065
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:04,720
 I don't know how they, but it's so organized and they used to play their bugles properly

1066
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:06,720
 and the officers would be mounted on their horses.

1067
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:10,720
 They'd fly their standards and then they'd just gallop at each other.

1068
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:11,720
 Very cool.

1069
00:46:11,720 --> 00:46:12,720
 That's amazing.

1070
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:13,720
 Tennessee won if you're interested.

1071
00:46:13,720 --> 00:46:18,720
 And if you captured someone from the opposition, then you'd drag them through the snow and

1072
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:22,720
 stuffed snow in their face and nose and eyes and down their back and stuff.

1073
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:24,720
 So you didn't want to be captured.

1074
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:25,720
 Wow.

1075
00:46:25,720 --> 00:46:26,720
 Sounds really good.

1076
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:27,720
 Good practice for the actual war.

1077
00:46:27,720 --> 00:46:28,720
 Oh, not that good.

1078
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:29,720
 Practice.

1079
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:33,720
 Maybe that's why they didn't win actually.

1080
00:46:33,720 --> 00:46:36,720
 Not having proper military training.

1081
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:37,720
 Yeah.

1082
00:46:37,720 --> 00:46:41,720
 First guy comes back going, "Guys, those bullets hurt way more than the snowballs.

1083
00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:43,720
 Heads up."

1084
00:46:43,720 --> 00:46:49,720
 Okay.

1085
00:46:49,720 --> 00:46:52,720
 It is time for our final fact of the show and that is Lydia.

1086
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:58,720
 My fact is that entrepreneurs have been ending their business's names with near me in an

1087
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:01,720
 attempt to appear near the top of search results.

1088
00:47:01,720 --> 00:47:02,720
 So that's so good.

1089
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:07,720
 It's like the modern day version of doing the naming your company with the letter A,

1090
00:47:07,720 --> 00:47:09,720
 you know, to get at the top of the phone.

1091
00:47:09,720 --> 00:47:10,720
 Bad fact, plumbing.

1092
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:11,720
 Yeah.

1093
00:47:11,720 --> 00:47:12,720
 Yeah, but is it good?

1094
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:20,720
 Because let's say this is, you know, a Tex-Mex restaurant in Santa Fe and they're called

1095
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:23,720
 Tex-Mex near me and I Googled it in London.

1096
00:47:23,720 --> 00:47:24,720
 Yeah.

1097
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:25,720
 What fucking use is that?

1098
00:47:25,720 --> 00:47:26,720
 You'll be on a flight.

1099
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:28,720
 You'll be like, "Well, I guess it's the closest one.

1100
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:29,720
 I really want to Tex-Mex."

1101
00:47:29,720 --> 00:47:33,720
 A bit further than we were hoping, but I do want it.

1102
00:47:33,720 --> 00:47:38,720
 This is exactly, it does work, but the problem is exactly what you have just said is that

1103
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:41,720
 it only works if you're within about a mile.

1104
00:47:41,720 --> 00:47:46,720
 So I read an article which is about this New York City restaurant called Tie Food Near Me.

1105
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:50,720
 So in NYC in New York City, it works because of the population density.

1106
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:53,720
 You're probably very close to things.

1107
00:47:53,720 --> 00:47:56,720
 Lots of people will be Googling Tie Food Near Me within a mile of this restaurant.

1108
00:47:56,720 --> 00:48:01,720
 But what's happened to make it really popular is that it's gone viral.

1109
00:48:01,720 --> 00:48:05,720
 Lots of people have been looking at it thinking, "This is a great joke.

1110
00:48:05,720 --> 00:48:06,720
 This is such a good idea."

1111
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:09,720
 And that in itself has pushed up the SEO.

1112
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:12,720
 So this has taken off in a way that I didn't really realize.

1113
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:20,720
 In Texas alone, there's six businesses called Affordable Dentist Near Me, which is quite bleak.

1114
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:23,720
 There's a psychic near me in Chicago.

1115
00:48:23,720 --> 00:48:25,720
 I have been spending some time.

1116
00:48:25,720 --> 00:48:28,720
 You've known that already with having to look.

1117
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:35,720
 In the UK, I did a company's house search and there are 90 companies in this country with near me.

1118
00:48:35,720 --> 00:48:36,720
 Really?

1119
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:40,720
 Including Skip Higher Near Me, Locksmiths Near Me.

1120
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:41,720
 Don't come.

1121
00:48:41,720 --> 00:48:44,720
 Somewhere in New Yorkshire called Cheap Flooring Near Me.

1122
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:48,720
 And in Oldham, there's a company called Fire Extinguishers Near Me, which means...

1123
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:49,720
 Oh my God.

1124
00:48:49,720 --> 00:48:52,720
 You'd think if you need a fire extinguisher, it might be a bit more urgent.

1125
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:54,720
 Yeah, I want one really near me.

1126
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:55,720
 Really, really near me.

1127
00:48:55,720 --> 00:49:00,720
 People don't set their house on fire and think, "Oh, we'd better buy a fire extinguisher."

1128
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:04,720
 Shit, the shop isn't open for another six hours.

1129
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:05,720
 That's why I'm awake.

1130
00:49:05,720 --> 00:49:06,720
 But you're right.

1131
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:10,720
 It's the modern equivalent of naming your business Double-A Plumbing or Triple-A Locksmiths.

1132
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:11,720
 Yeah, yeah.

1133
00:49:11,720 --> 00:49:16,720
 And Apple, obviously, I think we've said before, is called Apple because they wanted to be ahead of Atari.

1134
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:19,720
 I actually read that you can tell kind of how old a company is.

1135
00:49:19,720 --> 00:49:21,720
 Obviously, not really accurately.

1136
00:49:21,720 --> 00:49:27,720
 But if it's like hard about plumbing, you know that they came out around the time of Yellow Pages and telephone directories.

1137
00:49:27,720 --> 00:49:28,720
 Why? Yeah, yeah.

1138
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:35,720
 If they're called Dan Schreiber Locksmiths, then it came before that when the most important thing was reputation.

1139
00:49:35,720 --> 00:49:39,720
 So people would name it after the, you know, the name of the person.

1140
00:49:39,720 --> 00:49:42,720
 Probably not Dan Schreiber, though, if I'm being completely honest.

1141
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:44,720
 Do you?

1142
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:50,720
 And these days, like in the internet area, you might be more likely to be called, you know, Oxford Plumbing.

1143
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:51,720
 Yeah.

1144
00:49:51,720 --> 00:49:55,720
 Because people are more likely to search for the place or something like that.

1145
00:49:55,720 --> 00:49:56,720
 Right.

1146
00:49:56,720 --> 00:49:57,720
 Interesting, yeah.

1147
00:49:57,720 --> 00:49:59,720
 So I don't know if that's true, but I think it's a good rule of thumb.

1148
00:49:59,720 --> 00:50:04,720
 Yeah, I tried to, I was on the train when I had this thought and I couldn't get the research done.

1149
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:10,720
 But I imagine there must be examples of bands and authors who've taken on pseudonyms to place themselves.

1150
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:12,720
 Let's say you're a kid's author.

1151
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:16,720
 Why not make your name "Rollette" or something like that and be right next to the Harry Potter books?

1152
00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:18,720
 No, that's what, just write it really.

1153
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:19,720
 I think you have to write a good book.

1154
00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:21,720
 Yeah, I think that only works.

1155
00:50:21,720 --> 00:50:25,720
 That's only useful if you write some piece of shit that you want people to accidentally buy.

1156
00:50:25,720 --> 00:50:26,720
 Yes.

1157
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:29,720
 If you actually want to be a proper good author, you want to be distinct from these people, right?

1158
00:50:29,720 --> 00:50:33,720
 You can't go to your publisher next time, Dan, and be like, "I've come up with a brilliant concept."

1159
00:50:33,720 --> 00:50:36,720
 My name is Richard Usman.

1160
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:40,720
 Why did you make your surname start with you?

1161
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:44,720
 Oh yeah, I'm way away from him now.

1162
00:50:45,720 --> 00:50:49,720
 But the problem is that these things do move on so that wouldn't work anymore.

1163
00:50:49,720 --> 00:50:54,720
 And in fact, the near me thing hardly worked for any time at all because as soon as Google catches on,

1164
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:57,720
 as soon as the internet catches on, it rejigs its algorithm.

1165
00:50:57,720 --> 00:51:04,720
 So it doesn't work now because Google has been recoded so that now if you have, if you're called whatever, great dentist near me,

1166
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:10,720
 Google will discount the words "near me" as keywords so it won't look for anything with "near me" in the title.

1167
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:12,720
 And you've already made all the letterheads.

1168
00:51:13,720 --> 00:51:15,720
 That just looks stupid.

1169
00:51:15,720 --> 00:51:19,720
 So they'll see the words "near me" and Google will be like, "Okay, you want to find something near you."

1170
00:51:19,720 --> 00:51:22,720
 So they'll understand what it means but they won't look for the keywords.

1171
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:29,720
 So exactly, same with open now. Don't call your business something something open now because they discount those as well.

1172
00:51:29,720 --> 00:51:34,720
 And it's actually counterproductive because honestly, if I saw a business called something something near me,

1173
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:37,720
 I think that's really stupid.

1174
00:51:37,720 --> 00:51:38,720
 Do you think?

1175
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:43,720
 Do you not think it looks quite cheap? Would you go to Thai restaurant near me?

1176
00:51:43,720 --> 00:51:44,720
 For the gag, yeah.

1177
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:45,720
 You'd go for the gag.

1178
00:51:45,720 --> 00:51:51,720
 Would you? I actually thought that Vietnamese restaurant like banh mi, "near me" would be like that.

1179
00:51:51,720 --> 00:51:53,720
 That's good, well done.

1180
00:51:53,720 --> 00:51:55,720
 But FireExtinguisherShop open now.

1181
00:51:55,720 --> 00:51:58,720
 That'd be useful.

1182
00:51:58,720 --> 00:52:00,720
 But what about when it's not open?

1183
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:02,720
 You have to stay open all the time.

1184
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:06,720
 I think if your name is open now, the rules should be that your role is open.

1185
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:08,720
 I think I'm attracted to places like that.

1186
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:13,720
 For example, I used to go to a Thai restaurant that was up in North London specifically

1187
00:52:13,720 --> 00:52:18,720
 and it wasn't even in my bit of North London because it was called the Titanic genuinely.

1188
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:19,720
 That's great, all right.

1189
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:20,720
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1190
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:22,720
 Was it good food or?

1191
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:23,720
 It was fine, I don't know.

1192
00:52:23,720 --> 00:52:25,720
 Yeah, no, you didn't care.

1193
00:52:25,720 --> 00:52:27,720
 No, I just, I love a good joke.

1194
00:52:27,720 --> 00:52:29,720
 Or a bad joke, just a joke, I love a joke.

1195
00:52:29,720 --> 00:52:30,720
 Anyone having an effort?

1196
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:33,720
 I looked at the rules of naming companies in the UK.

1197
00:52:33,720 --> 00:52:38,720
 So if you have a limited company, your name has to end in limited.

1198
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:41,720
 Or it's also allowed to end in SIF.

1199
00:52:41,720 --> 00:52:42,720
 SIF.

1200
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:43,720
 S-I-T-H.

1201
00:52:43,720 --> 00:52:45,720
 C-Y-F.

1202
00:52:45,720 --> 00:52:46,720
 Can we guess why?

1203
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:48,720
 Riddle of me this.

1204
00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:50,720
 Is it guessable or is this what it is?

1205
00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:53,720
 I think that question was directed at Lydia.

1206
00:52:53,720 --> 00:52:55,720
 I think you and I said this one out.

1207
00:52:55,720 --> 00:52:58,720
 I'll tell you what, there is a clue if you've been on Only Connect

1208
00:52:58,720 --> 00:53:01,720
 because it's related to something to do with Only Connect.

1209
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:02,720
 Corrin.

1210
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:04,720
 Ah, no, where do they film Only Connect?

1211
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:05,720
 Oh, Cardiff.

1212
00:53:05,720 --> 00:53:06,720
 Which is in?

1213
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:07,720
 Wales.

1214
00:53:07,720 --> 00:53:08,720
 Which.

1215
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:09,720
 Oh, it's Welsh.

1216
00:53:09,720 --> 00:53:11,720
 Well, they speak.

1217
00:53:11,720 --> 00:53:14,720
 Yeah, it's Welsh, so it's SIFingadig,

1218
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:17,720
 which means limited, is shortened to SIF.

1219
00:53:17,720 --> 00:53:21,720
 SIFingadig, sounds like a song, sounds like a Mary J. Blyche song.

1220
00:53:21,720 --> 00:53:25,720
 SIFingadig.

1221
00:53:25,720 --> 00:53:28,720
 Who did that song where they say it backwards?

1222
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:29,720
 Did they?

1223
00:53:29,720 --> 00:53:30,720
 Oh, Missy Elliott.

1224
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:32,720
 Missy Elliott, is that who you think that?

1225
00:53:32,720 --> 00:53:34,720
 That's something he obviously...

1226
00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:35,720
 Same kind of era.

1227
00:53:35,720 --> 00:53:36,720
 Same kind of era.

1228
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:37,720
 That's true.

1229
00:53:37,720 --> 00:53:39,720
 I'm going to get myself a point.

1230
00:53:39,720 --> 00:53:40,720
 Okay, one point for me.

1231
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:42,720
 Is this Only Connect's work?

1232
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:45,720
 We haven't been on.

1233
00:53:45,720 --> 00:53:47,720
 There are words where you need permission

1234
00:53:47,720 --> 00:53:50,720
 to add them to your company name, a big long list of them.

1235
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:54,720
 So, you are not allowed to have the word benevolent

1236
00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:58,720
 in your company name because it implies you're a charity

1237
00:53:58,720 --> 00:54:00,720
 or that you're helping families or whatever.

1238
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:01,720
 Okay.

1239
00:54:01,720 --> 00:54:03,720
 What if you're a charity and you're helping families?

1240
00:54:03,720 --> 00:54:04,720
 You need permission still.

1241
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:05,720
 Well, you need permission, so...

1242
00:54:05,720 --> 00:54:06,720
 Yeah, you are allowed to.

1243
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:08,720
 It's possible that you're allowed them.

1244
00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:11,720
 The word Doug, you're not allowed.

1245
00:54:11,720 --> 00:54:13,720
 D-U-G, can you guess why?

1246
00:54:13,720 --> 00:54:14,720
 Is it Welsh?

1247
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:15,720
 Is it?

1248
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:16,720
 Is it?

1249
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:18,720
 It is Welsh, yeah.

1250
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:21,720
 I thought, hey, Dougie, you had somehow got the domain

1251
00:54:21,720 --> 00:54:23,720
 of every single possibility.

1252
00:54:23,720 --> 00:54:24,720
 Why not?

1253
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:26,720
 It's Welsh for Duke.

1254
00:54:26,720 --> 00:54:29,720
 And so, you're not allowed to be called King or Queen

1255
00:54:29,720 --> 00:54:31,720
 or Duke or whatever without permission

1256
00:54:31,720 --> 00:54:33,720
 because they might think that it's a royal company.

1257
00:54:33,720 --> 00:54:35,720
 What if your surname is King, Queen?

1258
00:54:35,720 --> 00:54:37,720
 Yeah, you would just have to say,

1259
00:54:37,720 --> 00:54:38,720
 is it okay that I do this?

1260
00:54:38,720 --> 00:54:39,720
 And they would say yes, I think.

1261
00:54:39,720 --> 00:54:41,720
 So, is it the Grand Old Doug of York?

1262
00:54:41,720 --> 00:54:42,720
 As a song.

1263
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:44,720
 No, because York is not in Wales.

1264
00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:47,720
 No, no, the song, just the Grand Old Doug of Cardiff.

1265
00:54:47,720 --> 00:54:48,720
 Okay, right.

1266
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:52,720
 And also, there are two cities.

1267
00:54:52,720 --> 00:54:54,720
 These are both in England,

1268
00:54:54,720 --> 00:54:56,720
 which are not allowed to use without permission.

1269
00:54:56,720 --> 00:54:57,720
 Okay.

1270
00:54:57,720 --> 00:54:58,720
 I bet it's going to...

1271
00:54:58,720 --> 00:54:59,720
 Both.

1272
00:54:59,720 --> 00:55:00,720
 Cheddar.

1273
00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:01,720
 Windsor?

1274
00:55:01,720 --> 00:55:02,720
 Windsor?

1275
00:55:02,720 --> 00:55:03,720
 Oh!

1276
00:55:03,720 --> 00:55:05,720
 Luthier has got one of them, Windsor.

1277
00:55:05,720 --> 00:55:08,720
 And the other one is very, very difficult to guess.

1278
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:09,720
 Is it a pun?

1279
00:55:09,720 --> 00:55:10,720
 Is it something that means something else?

1280
00:55:10,720 --> 00:55:11,720
 No, it's not.

1281
00:55:11,720 --> 00:55:14,720
 It's just because this city is very famous

1282
00:55:14,720 --> 00:55:15,720
 for making other things.

1283
00:55:15,720 --> 00:55:16,720
 Sheffield?

1284
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:18,720
 Manchester, sorry.

1285
00:55:18,720 --> 00:55:19,720
 Sorry.

1286
00:55:19,720 --> 00:55:21,720
 Sorry, I got it right again.

1287
00:55:21,720 --> 00:55:22,720
 Wow.

1288
00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:27,720
 Yeah, so the company of Cutlers is allowed to object to anyone calling their company Sheffield.

1289
00:55:27,720 --> 00:55:31,720
 FYI, International Relations, Sheffield's incredibly famous for making cutlery.

1290
00:55:31,720 --> 00:55:32,720
 Yeah.

1291
00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:35,720
 They do have to reject company names every year, don't they?

1292
00:55:35,720 --> 00:55:38,720
 Because obviously, a lot of people apply with these things in their titles,

1293
00:55:38,720 --> 00:55:41,720
 and often they get told they can't use that name,

1294
00:55:41,720 --> 00:55:44,720
 and often it is people who are like Queen's plumbing or whatever.

1295
00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:47,720
 But also, the company's house,

1296
00:55:47,720 --> 00:55:50,720
 which is sort of the British register of companies,

1297
00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:52,720
 and they say if you're allowed to set up a business,

1298
00:55:52,720 --> 00:55:54,720
 they don't allow offensive names,

1299
00:55:54,720 --> 00:55:57,720
 and so I was just looking at some of the names that have been rejected recently.

1300
00:55:57,720 --> 00:55:58,720
 Hey.

1301
00:55:58,720 --> 00:55:59,720
 Should we do some rejected names?

1302
00:55:59,720 --> 00:56:00,720
 Yes, please.

1303
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:01,720
 There are a lot.

1304
00:56:01,720 --> 00:56:06,720
 There are almost 57,000 names rejected between January 2019 and April 2022.

1305
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:07,720
 Wow.

1306
00:56:07,720 --> 00:56:08,720
 So they've gone through a lot.

1307
00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:09,720
 Wow.

1308
00:56:09,720 --> 00:56:11,720
 Lawnporn, UK.

1309
00:56:11,720 --> 00:56:14,720
 Is that a gardening place or a pornography place?

1310
00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:16,720
 I think it does both, yeah.

1311
00:56:16,720 --> 00:56:19,720
 The husband does the gardening, and then the wife does the porn.

1312
00:56:19,720 --> 00:56:20,720
 Lawnporn.

1313
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:23,720
 I think probably just lawn-knowing.

1314
00:56:23,720 --> 00:56:25,720
 Doggy style, which...

1315
00:56:25,720 --> 00:56:26,720
 Yeah.

1316
00:56:26,720 --> 00:56:27,720
 That's good.

1317
00:56:27,720 --> 00:56:28,720
 Is that like dog hairdressers?

1318
00:56:28,720 --> 00:56:31,720
 Well, the sad thing about the fact they were rejected as company names is

1319
00:56:31,720 --> 00:56:34,720
 you can't actually look up the company and find out what it does,

1320
00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:38,720
 but I've got to assume it's an anal sex selling company.

1321
00:56:38,720 --> 00:56:39,720
 Yeah.

1322
00:56:39,720 --> 00:56:40,720
 Come with us.

1323
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:42,720
 We're all your anal sex selling.

1324
00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:46,720
 Always open.

1325
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:53,720
 We have to enter around the back of the building.

1326
00:56:53,720 --> 00:56:58,720
 I'm bull parking in the rear.

1327
00:56:58,720 --> 00:57:01,720
 And bum face and dick weasel.

1328
00:57:01,720 --> 00:57:04,720
 Can I just say, me and Dan were very upset.

1329
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:08,720
 They wouldn't let us use our perfectly normal nicknames.

1330
00:57:08,720 --> 00:57:11,720
 That's our fringe show this year, isn't it?

1331
00:57:11,720 --> 00:57:19,720
 Double act.

1332
00:57:19,720 --> 00:57:20,720
 Okay, that's it.

1333
00:57:20,720 --> 00:57:21,720
 That is all of our facts.

1334
00:57:21,720 --> 00:57:22,720
 Thank you so much for listening.

1335
00:57:22,720 --> 00:57:25,720
 If you'd like to get in contact with any of us about the things that we've said

 Also on Twitter @LydiaMison.

1342
00:57:38,720 --> 00:57:39,720
 Yep.

1343
00:57:39,720 --> 00:57:42,720
 But if you want to get to us as a big old fish group, where do they go, Anna?

1344
00:57:42,720 --> 00:57:48,720
 You can go to @NoSuchThing on Twitter or you can go to @NoSuchThing as a fish on Instagram

1345
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:50,720
 or you can email podcast.QI.com.

1346
00:57:50,720 --> 00:57:51,720
 Yep.

1347
00:57:51,720 --> 00:57:53,720

 a member of Club Fish.

1350
00:57:58,720 --> 00:58:00,720
 It's where we have lots of bonus episodes.

1351
00:58:00,720 --> 00:58:04,720
 It's where there's a link to the Discord where all the listeners of the show can hang out

1352
00:58:04,720 --> 00:58:09,720

1353
00:58:09,720 --> 00:58:10,720
 shows and so on.

1354

 You want to be the first to find out, become a member of Club Fish and that's the place

1355
00:58:14,720 --> 00:58:15,720
 to do it.

1356
00:58:15,720 --> 00:58:16,720
 Or otherwise, just come back here next week.

1357
00:58:16,720 --> 00:58:17,720
 We'll be back with another episode.

1358
00:58:17,720 --> 00:58:18,720
 We'll see you then.

1359
00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:19,720
 Goodbye.

1360
00:58:19,720 --> 00:58:20,720
 Bye.
