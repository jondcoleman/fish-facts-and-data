00:00:02,00:00:06,"Hi everyone, welcome to this week's episode of No Such Things as Fish."
00:00:06,00:00:12,Andrew Hunter Murray is away this week and so in his place we have one of the QI elves.
00:00:12,00:00:15,It is Lydia Maison.
00:00:15,00:00:21,Now those of you who listen to us occasionally talk to Zoey Ball on Radio 2 might know Lydia.
00:00:21,00:00:25,She's one of our regular elves on the Y workshop.
00:00:25,00:00:31,But also anyone deeply ingrained in UK geek culture will know her name.
00:00:31,00:00:32,Where is it from?
00:00:32,00:00:39,"Yes, she was one of the winners of season 13 of Only Connect when she was in the team"
00:00:39,00:00:45,of the escapologists a couple of years after we didn't win Only Connect.
00:00:45,00:00:48,I'm really sure you'll enjoy this show with Lydia.
00:00:48,00:00:51,"She's very nice, very funny and knows a lot of stuff."
00:00:51,00:00:56,"While I'm here I might as well remind you to join Club Fish, especially if you like listening"
00:00:56,00:01:01,to all these newer elves because we do a featurette with those guys called Meet the
00:01:01,00:01:05,Elves where they send us a fiendish question and we try to solve it.
00:01:05,00:01:08,We also have lots of compilations on there.
00:01:08,00:01:13,We have other bonus features like Drop as a Line where people send us correspondence.
00:01:13,00:01:14,We have quizzes.
00:01:14,00:01:15,We have all sorts.
00:01:15,00:01:19,There's a discord which you can go to and talk to like-minded fish friends.
00:01:19,00:01:26,And if by any chance we were to announce some live shows in the next few months then that
00:01:26,00:01:28,is where you would hear about them first.
00:01:28,00:01:37,So come and join us at Club Fish by going to knowsuchthingsafish.com/apple or knowsuchthingsafish.com/patreon
00:01:37,00:01:39,if you are not an Apple user.
00:01:39,00:01:41,"If you're missing Andrew Hunter Murray, fear not."
00:01:41,00:01:46,He will be back very soon and you can always get your fix of Andy by buying one of his
00:01:46,00:01:48,wonderful bugs.
00:01:48,00:01:54,I believe his latest Beginner's Guide to Breaking and Entering might be available for
00:01:54,00:01:56,pre-order if you go online.
00:01:56,00:01:57,"In fact, yes it is."
00:01:57,00:01:58,I've just checked.
00:01:58,00:01:59,So definitely go and get that.
00:01:59,00:02:02,We'll tell you more about that when it actually comes out.
00:02:02,00:02:05,"Dan has a book out of course, The Theory of Everything Else."
00:02:05,00:02:09,Me and Anna also have a book out which is Everything to Play for the QI Book of Sports.
00:02:09,00:02:10,Why not buy all three?
00:02:10,00:02:11,Or why not?
00:02:11,00:02:16,"Sit back, relax and listen to this episode of Knowsuchthingsafish with QI elf Lydia Meisen."
00:02:16,00:02:34,"Okay, on with the podcast."
00:02:34,00:02:40,"Hello and welcome to another episode of Knowsuchthingsafish, a weekly podcast coming to you from the QI"
00:02:40,00:02:42,offices in Hoburn.
00:02:42,00:02:47,"My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here with Anna Tyshinski, James Harkin and Lydia"
00:02:47,00:02:51,Meisen and once again we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts
00:02:51,00:02:56,from the last seven days and in no particular order here we go.
00:02:56,00:02:59,Starting with fact number one and that is James.
00:02:59,00:03:06,"Okay, my fact this week is that golfer Brenda Keane took part in the 2001 Women's US Open"
00:03:06,00:03:11,while eight months pregnant and started contractions on one of her back swings.
00:03:11,00:03:17,The resulting daughter will become a professional golfer later this year.
00:03:17,00:03:18,So good.
00:03:18,00:03:19,Isn't that amazing?
00:03:19,00:03:21,"Yeah, that is amazing."
00:03:21,00:03:25,"How do you know she, how are the rules of golf, I want to get into golf."
00:03:25,00:03:26,How do we...
00:03:26,00:03:29,"Can I just say, dear listener, we're not going to talk about golf this whole section."
00:03:29,00:03:33,"Please stay with us, it's okay, that's the condition on which James is permitted another"
00:03:33,00:03:34,headline golfer.
00:03:34,00:03:35,We don't discuss golf.
00:03:35,00:03:39,"If you really hate golf, maybe just press fast forward about ten times and then we'll"
00:03:39,00:03:40,get on to the normal stuff.
00:03:40,00:03:44,How do you know someone's going to be a pro golfer before they are a pro golfer?
00:03:44,00:03:47,So this is Rachel Keane and she has said in an interview that that's what's going to
00:03:47,00:03:48,happen.
00:03:48,00:03:49,She's now mature at the moment.
00:03:49,00:03:54,"She does college golf, she's one of the best and for quite a while she's been saying she's"
00:03:54,00:03:58,"going to become a professional but yeah, she spoke in golf week saying that she is going"
00:03:58,00:04:02,to become a professional this fall or this autumn for English people.
00:04:02,00:04:06,And this is the fact which I learned when watching the Netflix Golf Documentary Series
00:04:06,00:04:07,Full Swing.
00:04:07,00:04:12,There was an episode about English golfer Alex Fitzpatrick and this was just like a
00:04:12,00:04:15,throwaway line about his partner in that documentary.
00:04:15,00:04:19,"P.S. and Netflix, do you feel free to commission anything that we pitched you a future?"
00:04:19,00:04:20,We love you.
00:04:20,00:04:24,"Can I ask, when she had the contraction, was she mid game and continued the game?"
00:04:24,00:04:25,Yep.
00:04:25,00:04:27,So it happened on the 11th tee.
00:04:27,00:04:29,So the 11th of 18 holes.
00:04:29,00:04:32,She said I could feel it coming but I was too embarrassed to back out.
00:04:32,00:04:37,She didn't follow through.
00:04:37,00:04:38,That's a golfing term.
00:04:38,00:04:42,She did her golf follow through and then was doubled up in pain.
00:04:42,00:04:48,The whole round she shot nine over par which is not brilliant but actually the real problem
00:04:48,00:04:52,"was she was really nervous because there was loads of TV coverage about it, loads of press"
00:04:52,00:04:57,about it that she was pregnant and doing this and in actual fact she had her worst holes
00:04:57,00:05:01,at the start of the round and after the contractions on the 11th hole she was level par for the
00:05:01,00:05:02,rest of the round.
00:05:02,00:05:05,So her game improved after that happened.
00:05:05,00:05:06,Are we crediting her daughter with that?
00:05:06,00:05:09,"You know, her daughter got started getting involved, was like listen I'm going to be"
00:05:09,00:05:10,a pro.
00:05:10,00:05:14,"I think that might be right because she is amazing, she's such a great golfer."
00:05:14,00:05:19,"So Fenella had three planned C sections but we all must, you know, you three must remember"
00:05:19,00:05:21,the moment of the first contraction.
00:05:21,00:05:24,What were you doing and do you think your child will become that thing?
00:05:24,00:05:25,Lydia.
00:05:25,00:05:32,"Well, I was sleeping and if my daughter could start sleeping a little bit better than she"
00:05:32,00:05:35,"currently is, that would be great."
00:05:35,00:05:36,That's amazing.
00:05:36,00:05:38,"Yeah, I think I was as well."
00:05:38,00:05:40,I was having a cup of tea.
00:05:40,00:05:46,I was having a morning cup of tea in the garden so a professional tea plantation owner is
00:05:46,00:05:48,what I'm schooling my daughter to be.
00:05:48,00:05:50,We were watching the Super Bowl when my wife's...
00:05:50,00:05:51,"Oh, that's much cooler."
00:05:51,00:05:52,Here we go.
00:05:52,00:05:53,What?
00:05:53,00:05:54,"No, that's great."
00:05:54,00:05:58,So my daughter's going to be a tight end for the Pittsburgh Steelers.
00:05:58,00:06:02,Or a slouch who just watches TV at home.
00:06:02,00:06:07,So it turns out Brenda's daughter might have actually helped because during pregnancy the
00:06:07,00:06:14,fetus and the mother share cells and once the baby's born they leave some of their DNA
00:06:14,00:06:15,in the mother.
00:06:15,00:06:20,"It's called Fetometernal Microchimerism and as a result for mothers who have sons, male"
00:06:20,00:06:27,DNA has been found in mothers up to 30 years after the birth and it also works that if
00:06:27,00:06:33,"the mother sustains organ damage while they're pregnant, the fetus can send cells, not consciously"
00:06:33,00:06:36,"obviously, but send cells to repair the damaged organ."
00:06:36,00:06:39,So maybe by sending golfing cells.
00:06:39,00:06:42,"The golf cells, have they identified yet the golfing cells?"
00:06:42,00:06:46,"They have identified golf cells, they're very round."
00:06:46,00:06:50,"They're a little dimpled in them, okay."
00:06:50,00:06:55,"And just to finish up on their family, Rachel Keane's grandparents were also golfers on"
00:06:55,00:06:56,her mother's side.
00:06:56,00:07:02,Her grandfather Jack played for Venezuela in the first World Amateur Team Championships
00:07:02,00:07:07,in St Andrews and her grandmother Carmen was the captain of the Dominican team in the
00:07:07,00:07:09,World Amateurs in 1986.
00:07:09,00:07:13,So it is definitely in the genes.
00:07:13,00:07:15,"It's not allowed on golf courses, just to say."
00:07:15,00:07:16,Are they not?
00:07:16,00:07:19,It's endlessly fascinating golf.
00:07:19,00:07:26,"Okay, so if you are one of the people who was fast forwarding to not hear any golf,"
00:07:26,00:07:27,you can come back into the room right now.
00:07:27,00:07:28,I can't promise that.
00:07:28,00:07:31,I can't guarantee I won't ask again.
00:07:31,00:07:36,"But then if you have absolutely no interest in pregnancy, maybe fast forward another 15"
00:07:36,00:07:37,minutes or so.
00:07:37,00:07:41,"And then if you're not interested in yetis, probably another 15 minutes."
00:07:41,00:07:42,Probably a couple of years.
00:07:42,00:07:45,"Yeah, people do do incredible things while pregnant."
00:07:45,00:07:49,Something that I think is often played down is when people do stuff in first trimester
00:07:49,00:07:52,"pregnancy, you get all the sympathy when you're massive."
00:07:52,00:07:55,"And personally, my experience is that's fine."
00:07:55,00:08:00,"You know, I was bounding up steps carrying a bike, but first trimester is living hell"
00:08:00,00:08:02,"for a lot of women, I think."
00:08:02,00:08:03,With morning sicknesses.
00:08:03,00:08:05,"With morning sickness, basically."
00:08:05,00:08:09,"So for instance, I was reading about someone who won the Mount Everest Marathon."
00:08:09,00:08:10,"And I didn't know this existed, actually."
00:08:10,00:08:11,Is it?
00:08:11,00:08:12,Do you start at the top?
00:08:12,00:08:13,Because that's the one I would like to do.
00:08:13,00:08:16,"Yeah, and then you sit on a sledge."
00:08:16,00:08:19,"You don't even encompass the top, which seems a shame."
00:08:19,00:08:22,"You start at base camp at 17,500 feet."
00:08:22,00:08:23,That's pretty high.
00:08:23,00:08:25,And you sort of run about.
00:08:25,00:08:31,"And it was won in 2013 by Ang Dami Sherpa, Sherpa lady, who was 44 at the time and three"
00:08:31,00:08:32,months pregnant.
00:08:32,00:08:34,And she won the women's race.
00:08:34,00:08:38,"And I think if you've got bad morning sickness, that's much harder than winning it at eight"
00:08:38,00:08:39,months pregnant.
00:08:39,00:08:40,Oh yeah.
00:08:40,00:08:41,And you're tired as well.
00:08:41,00:08:46,"And you can't tell anybody, so you just have to persist through 12 weeks of pretending"
00:08:46,00:08:47,you're fine.
00:08:47,00:08:48,Yeah.
00:08:48,00:08:50,"And I was just going, God, you've got crap at this, haven't you?"
00:08:50,00:08:53,You suck at Mount Everest marathons.
00:08:53,00:08:54,What's going on?
00:08:54,00:08:55,"Anyway, well done, her."
00:08:55,00:08:56,Ang Dami Sherpa.
00:08:56,00:08:57,That was the point.
00:08:57,00:08:58,Yeah.
00:08:58,00:09:01,There's a lot of debate and anger over the years about what happens when people get pregnant
00:09:01,00:09:03,and how workplaces deal with them.
00:09:03,00:09:05,And opera has this quite a lot.
00:09:05,00:09:08,"And there's an interesting thing with opera that for certain plays, like Wagner plays,"
00:09:08,00:09:12,"there's a lot of flying in Wagner plays, so they don't feel safe."
00:09:12,00:09:14,Humans can't do that anyway.
00:09:14,00:09:18,"But you're on, you're on, you know, the, the pulley systems and the wires."
00:09:18,00:09:20,And so they say you can't do that.
00:09:20,00:09:21,That's not the thing.
00:09:21,00:09:23,"If you're a valkyrie, you mean?"
00:09:23,00:09:24,Yeah.
00:09:24,00:09:25,Exactly.
00:09:25,00:09:26,Yeah.
00:09:26,00:09:28,But one of the major things as well is that your voice changes.
00:09:28,00:09:34,And I don't know if either of you two sing and then have noticed post-birth of your child.
00:09:34,00:09:37,I've never heard that a thing I don't think in my entire life.
00:09:37,00:09:38,That's a real shame.
00:09:38,00:09:41,"I sing a lot, but mostly in private, which I think is for the best."
00:09:41,00:09:42,Yeah.
00:09:42,00:09:43,Right.
00:09:43,00:09:45,You said to me the other day you thought my voice had changed.
00:09:45,00:09:46,Oh.
00:09:46,00:09:47,"You said, you said I sounded husky."
00:09:47,00:09:49,"You did sound husky, but I thought that was because you had a cold."
00:09:49,00:09:50,"No, but I didn't."
00:09:50,00:09:52,"But then you just say it's because, yeah, you, it's just got, it's got husky."
00:09:52,00:09:53,Yeah.
00:09:53,00:09:56,"You're just smoking 30 a day, aren't you?"
00:09:56,00:09:57,Yeah.
00:09:57,00:09:58,"This is, this is a genuine thing."
00:09:58,00:10:01,"And the science is not fully understood at the moment, so they're looking into it."
00:10:01,00:10:06,"But they say after the, after childbirth, voices of opera singers often become enriched"
00:10:06,00:10:09,"with warmth, creaminess and depth of color."
00:10:09,00:10:13,"As I say, the science is not really strong on this at the moment."
00:10:13,00:10:14,Creaminess.
00:10:14,00:10:15,Creaminess.
00:10:15,00:10:17,"But, um, yeah, there's a, so there's a guy called Paul Quack."
00:10:17,00:10:19,"Again, that's not a good."
00:10:19,00:10:20,You're joking.
00:10:20,00:10:21,You're joking.
00:10:21,00:10:27,"I didn't notice that until now, Dr. Quack, an ENG specialist."
00:10:27,00:10:29,A snake-hole specialist.
00:10:29,00:10:33,"He said that, I've got to check that this is not an April first."
00:10:33,00:10:38,"He said, you're so good at that noise."
00:10:38,00:10:43,"I feel like you've done it a disproportionate number of times over the years, showing it"
00:10:43,00:10:44,off.
00:10:44,00:10:45,Yeah.
00:10:45,00:10:48,He says they're affected by the hypervascular state of the body that it enters to in pregnancy.
00:10:48,00:10:52,It creates more blood vessels and increases blood flow through the tissue.
00:10:52,00:10:54,"And as a result, it changes the voice."
00:10:54,00:10:55,"So, yeah."
00:10:55,00:10:59,"It definitely does seem to be true that voices get sort of better in, and this is during"
00:10:59,00:11:01,pregnancy for opera singers.
00:11:01,00:11:04,"And it's because there's that, you know, women have almost 50% more blood at the time."
00:11:04,00:11:09,"But they say they're particularly good at the apoggio technique, which is, I didn't"
00:11:09,00:11:11,"know about, apparently this is crucial in opera."
00:11:11,00:11:15,And it's where you basically exhale while leaving your ribs open.
00:11:15,00:11:18,I spent about an hour trying to do this when I read about this yesterday.
00:11:18,00:11:22,"And that makes you a really good singer, or it's going to make James pass out."
00:11:22,00:11:24,How do you open your ribs?
00:11:24,00:11:28,"Yeah, you need some equipment, actually."
00:11:28,00:11:32,"But they also said that the baby acts like a corset, which you can push against."
00:11:32,00:11:37,"So the baby is pushing up against your diaphragm, and you kind of use that pressure to push"
00:11:37,00:11:38,up against it.
00:11:38,00:11:42,"And one opera singer, Katherine Lewick, said that in the second trimester, she felt like"
00:11:42,00:11:43,she was performing on steroids.
00:11:43,00:11:46,High notes just came shooting out of me.
00:11:46,00:11:48,That's amazing.
00:11:48,00:11:53,"On singers and singing, do you guys know about Effeni Shakur?"
00:11:53,00:11:54,Effeni Shakur.
00:11:54,00:11:56,She related to Tupac Shakur?
00:11:56,00:11:58,She is indeed his mother.
00:11:58,00:11:59,"Oh, God."
00:11:59,00:12:01,Look at my cool music knowledge.
00:12:01,00:12:05,Do you listen to her albums as a person it is?
00:12:05,00:12:07,Huge fan of all of Tupac's family's albums.
00:12:07,00:12:12,"She was a member of the Black Panthers, and she was arrested and charged with counts"
00:12:12,00:12:17,of conspiracy to bomb police stations while she was pregnant with Tupac.
00:12:17,00:12:22,And she represented herself in court and got an undercover cop to admit under oath that
00:12:22,00:12:27,he and the other agents had basically organized all the unlawful stuff.
00:12:27,00:12:32,"And they were kind of undercover cops, but they were trying to get them to do things"
00:12:32,00:12:38,"that were illegal, and then they all got acquitted in May 1971, and then she gave birth to Tupac"
00:12:38,00:12:39,in June.
00:12:39,00:12:40,Nice.
00:12:40,00:12:44,"So like less than a month later, so she was eight months pregnant when she was doing that"
00:12:44,00:12:45,stuff in court.
00:12:45,00:12:46,Wow.
00:12:46,00:12:47,That's pretty cool.
00:12:47,00:12:48,Good timing.
00:12:48,00:12:49,"We're all doing, I learned this fact from Jay-Z."
00:12:49,00:12:53,"Oh, sorry, is that a name drop?"
00:12:53,00:12:55,"You're just hanging out with Jay-Z, Leslie?"
00:12:55,00:12:59,"Yeah, me and Jay, we're hanging out, and no, he did this interview where he stops the"
00:12:59,00:13:04,"interview and he says, ""You white people, you all do white people pronunciation of Tupac's"
00:13:04,00:13:05,name.
00:13:05,00:13:06,"It's Tupac, not Tupac."""
00:13:06,00:13:11,"No, I know Tupac, but when I try to say Tupac, it sounds like I'm a posh person saying that."
00:13:11,00:13:16,"So it's like, I'm really sorry, people who are actual fans who say Tupac, but we can't"
00:13:16,00:13:17,get away with it.
00:13:17,00:13:21,"So I know it's Tupac, but I say Tupac because I'm from the north of England."
00:13:21,00:13:22,Exactly.
00:13:22,00:13:23,There's a lot of qualifier.
00:13:23,00:13:27,"That's why I told Jay-Z, I said, ""Have you been to the north?"""
00:13:27,00:13:28,It's how they say it there.
00:13:28,00:13:33,"You mean Jay-Z, right?"
00:13:33,00:13:36,Another person who had a tough time during pregnancy was Thomas Beattie.
00:13:36,00:13:37,Thomas Beattie.
00:13:37,00:13:38,Nice.
00:13:38,00:13:39,Remember Thomas Beattie?
00:13:39,00:13:41,Is that the transgender man who gave birth?
00:13:41,00:13:42,Absolutely.
00:13:42,00:13:46,"In 2010, got the Guinness World Record for being the world's first married man to give"
00:13:46,00:13:47,birth.
00:13:47,00:13:51,He was a transgender man who was partway through gender reassignment surgery.
00:13:51,00:13:55,"Not, I mean, not literally partway through at the time, right?"
00:13:55,00:13:57,"Step back, step back."
00:13:57,00:14:01,"Had some parts of it, not other parts."
00:14:01,00:14:05,"He says people's attitudes have improved since 2008, but only slightly."
00:14:05,00:14:09,Back then it was 99.99999% terrible.
00:14:09,00:14:12,"Today, it's probably only 95% terrible."
00:14:12,00:14:15,"But a few interesting things about Thomas Beattie, because people will remember that"
00:14:15,00:14:20,"story, I reckon, who are listening to this, because he was quite famous at the time."
00:14:20,00:14:23,But his fifth great-grandfather was William Henry Harrison.
00:14:23,00:14:24,Whoa!
00:14:24,00:14:25,Really?
00:14:25,00:14:26,The ninth president.
00:14:26,00:14:27,Really?
00:14:27,00:14:28,Yeah.
00:14:28,00:14:32,"And his third great-uncle was Benjamin Harrison, who was another president."
00:14:32,00:14:33,Wow.
00:14:33,00:14:36,We're getting a lot of great descendant of president energy in recent shows.
00:14:36,00:14:37,You know what?
00:14:37,00:14:38,I was thinking exactly the same thing.
00:14:38,00:14:44,"So, his third great-uncle was Benjamin Harrison, and Lydia, you'll know this, Benjamin Harrison"
00:14:44,00:14:47,"was what, the 23rd was he?"
00:14:47,00:14:49,"And there was someone who was twice, who's the person who was..."
00:14:49,00:14:50,Cleveland.
00:14:50,00:14:51,"Cleveland, yeah."
00:14:51,00:14:54,Grover Cleveland was president twice on either side of him.
00:14:54,00:14:57,And Grover Cleveland was the person who we mentioned the other day.
00:14:57,00:15:01,"Yeah, because he was the grandfather..."
00:15:01,00:15:02,Of the trolley problem.
00:15:02,00:15:03,The woman...
00:15:03,00:15:04,Philippa Foote.
00:15:04,00:15:05,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:15:05,00:15:07,"Yeah, the creator of the trolley problem."
00:15:07,00:15:13,"But anyway, Thomas Beattie was also in the vastly superior French version of Big Brother,"
00:15:13,00:15:16,"which we mentioned before, I think, where every participant has to have a secret."
00:15:16,00:15:18,Do you remember that?
00:15:18,00:15:19,No.
00:15:19,00:15:20,No.
00:15:20,00:15:23,"So, in French Big Brother, you go in and you also have a secret, and there's a secondary"
00:15:23,00:15:26,part where people have to guess what your secret is.
00:15:26,00:15:31,"So while he was on it, another participant had a city in Sri Lanka named after her family,"
00:15:31,00:15:33,and another one was the World Car Washing Champion.
00:15:33,00:15:40,"But there was one, it was a few years after this, there was one where one of the contestants"
00:15:40,00:15:41,was a dog.
00:15:41,00:15:43,That's an easy one to guess.
00:15:43,00:15:46,"No, that wasn't what their secret was."
00:15:46,00:15:47,"Oh, that's not the secret."
00:15:47,00:15:48,"No, no, that was out in the open."
00:15:48,00:15:49,"Sorry, right."
00:15:49,00:15:54,The amazing secret was that they were the mayor of a town in France.
00:15:54,00:15:55,So good.
00:15:55,00:15:58,It's actually ridiculous.
00:15:58,00:16:00,Do you know the leading advocate of natural childbirth?
00:16:00,00:16:04,"So in the 20th century, it became common to advocate that, because surgery was becoming"
00:16:04,00:16:08,"more common and also it was early day surgery, so it was much more dangerous."
00:16:08,00:16:13,"And someone, one of the first people to talk about how important it was to promote natural"
00:16:13,00:16:16,childbirth was a guy called Grant Lee Dick Reid.
00:16:16,00:16:18,I just really enjoy his name.
00:16:18,00:16:20,"Dick Reid, okay."
00:16:20,00:16:23,"Or could be Dick Redd, and I don't know which is what it's because it's Reid, like, read"
00:16:23,00:16:24,a book.
00:16:24,00:16:25,R-E-A-D.
00:16:25,00:16:26,Yeah.
00:16:26,00:16:27,Yeah.
00:16:27,00:16:31,"I think if it's Redd, there's more open to problems if you say my dick's redd, people"
00:16:31,00:16:32,don't know.
00:16:32,00:16:33,Yeah.
00:16:33,00:16:34,"Yeah, you're right."
00:16:34,00:16:35,You're right.
00:16:35,00:16:36,People don't know.
00:16:36,00:16:39,People are just currently reading it.
00:16:39,00:16:40,Exactly.
00:16:40,00:16:41,Yeah.
00:16:41,00:16:42,That was before pictures.
00:16:42,00:16:43,"Dick Reid, right?"
00:16:43,00:16:44,He sent me a dick Reid.
00:16:44,00:16:51,It was a 19th century dick pic.
00:16:51,00:17:01,"Okay, it is time for fact number two, and that is Anna."
00:17:01,00:17:05,"My fact this week is that for almost a thousand years, Christians have debated whether to"
00:17:05,00:17:09,treat the barnacle goose as a barnacle or a goose.
00:17:09,00:17:13,"Are we going to argue over it now, or is it being decided?"
00:17:13,00:17:18,"I think it's too controversial a topic for us to take a stand on which it is, so we can"
00:17:18,00:17:19,just talk about it today in general.
00:17:19,00:17:21,It certainly looks like a goose.
00:17:21,00:17:27,"No, it is a goose, obviously, but it's been this very controversial thing for more than"
00:17:27,00:17:33,"a thousand years, in fact, because when meat is not allowed, usually it's lent or on Fridays,"
00:17:33,00:17:38,"it's always varied what days you fast in Christianity, depending on time and place and denomination,"
00:17:38,00:17:40,but fish tends to be permitted.
00:17:40,00:17:44,And there was this rumour going around in about the 12th century that the barnacle goose
00:17:44,00:17:50,"was maybe a fish, maybe a sort of barnacle-y thing, grew for barnacles, so they said maybe"
00:17:50,00:17:54,"we can eat it, maybe we can't, and across the ages, if you look it up, there are just"
00:17:54,00:17:59,"constantly people saying, well, the Irish bishops are still doing that thing where they eat"
00:17:59,00:18:00,barnacle geese.
00:18:00,00:18:06,"I mean, I think Gerald of Wales in 1187 campaigned against it, but acknowledged that they were"
00:18:06,00:18:07,probably kind of barnacles.
00:18:07,00:18:12,"They grew out of wood, but he still said that's no reason for these bishops in Ireland to"
00:18:12,00:18:13,treat them.
00:18:13,00:18:14,Did they not find eggs?
00:18:14,00:18:18,How does anyone think that a goose comes from a barnacle?
00:18:18,00:18:20,"Yeah, it's interesting, isn't it?"
00:18:20,00:18:27,"You've got to suspect they didn't look hard enough, because their reasoning was pretty"
00:18:27,00:18:28,weird anyway.
00:18:28,00:18:33,"It's essentially that goose barnacles, which are the barnacles that barnacle geese were"
00:18:33,00:18:37,"thought to have sprouted from, tend to grow on the bottom of bits of wood that are floating"
00:18:37,00:18:43,"around at sea, and sort of have a goose-like shape-ish, has been the claim."
00:18:43,00:18:46,"Kind of white, aren't they, with like a black bit?"
00:18:46,00:18:48,"Necky thing, which you might call a neck."
00:18:48,00:18:50,"It doesn't have a head attached, which does seem to be a problem, but whatever."
00:18:50,00:18:51,Or any wings.
00:18:51,00:18:52,Or legs.
00:18:52,00:18:53,No.
00:18:53,00:18:54,No.
00:18:54,00:18:56,But they were radius back then.
00:18:56,00:18:57,Sounds like a goose to me.
00:18:57,00:18:58,I mean...
00:18:58,00:19:03,"It's true, I think, that the geese would migrate, so they would all disappear, and there'd"
00:19:03,00:19:04,be no geese.
00:19:04,00:19:08,"And then the geese would come back, and we didn't know that migration was a thing, so"
00:19:08,00:19:11,"it just seemed like they all disappeared, and then they all came back."
00:19:11,00:19:15,"But they all came back about the same time as Driftwood was coming in, with all these"
00:19:15,00:19:18,"barnacles on them, and stuff like that, I think."
00:19:18,00:19:19,Okay.
00:19:19,00:19:20,Yeah.
00:19:20,00:19:22,"I think, basically, the problem was, no one knew what migration was."
00:19:22,00:19:27,"All birds disappeared, and then they all came back, and people's kids would be like,"
00:19:27,00:19:28,"""Why are there no geese?"
00:19:28,00:19:29,Yeah.
00:19:29,00:19:30,Why are there no geese in the winter?
00:19:30,00:19:32,"Why are they only here in the summer?"""
00:19:32,00:19:34,And then people's parents had to make up some bullshit.
00:19:34,00:19:36,"""Oh, you see that tree?"
00:19:36,00:19:38,"Yeah, they come off the tree."
00:19:38,00:19:39,"Now, eat your peas."""
00:19:39,00:19:41,It was much easier to make things up back then.
00:19:41,00:19:45,"There was a man called John Gerrard, who actually had a garden here in Hoburn, that he wrote"
00:19:45,00:19:50,"a book about all the plants that you would find in it, and he said barnacle geese literally"
00:19:50,00:19:52,grew on trees.
00:19:52,00:19:57,"And he covered his own back by saying, ""Look, I have seen this happen, but in some parts"
00:19:57,00:19:58,"of the country, it doesn't happen."
00:19:58,00:20:02,"So if anybody from another part of England tells you that it doesn't happen, they're"
00:20:02,00:20:05,"probably telling the truth, but I have seen it happen."
00:20:05,00:20:10,"So in the north, they may be speaking their own truth, but I've seen it happen."""
00:20:10,00:20:11,Really?
00:20:11,00:20:13,So there's much less science to go on in those days.
00:20:13,00:20:17,"After Gerrard's death, one of his friends issued an update to his book with lots of"
00:20:17,00:20:18,corrections.
00:20:18,00:20:19,"Oh, really?"
00:20:19,00:20:20,Yeah.
00:20:20,00:20:21,Backchecked it?
00:20:21,00:20:22,Yeah.
00:20:22,00:20:23,It's a great idea.
00:20:23,00:20:27,"The chance of me outliving you is probably pretty slim, but if I do, I'm going through"
00:20:27,00:20:29,your book with a red pen.
00:20:29,00:20:30,"Oh, God."
00:20:30,00:20:34,"Jesus, there won't be anything left."
00:20:34,00:20:40,"In Ireland, I was reading a few slang terms to do with lent, and Green's slang dictionary"
00:20:40,00:20:43,"has this thing, which is cock Tuesday."
00:20:43,00:20:44,Cock Tuesday?
00:20:44,00:20:45,Yeah.
00:20:45,00:20:46,Okay.
00:20:46,00:20:49,"So it's sort of like in the eve prior to lent, it'd be, I guess, where you would gorge"
00:20:49,00:20:50,yourself.
00:20:50,00:20:53,"Oh, so what now is pancake day?"
00:20:53,00:20:54,Yeah.
00:20:54,00:20:55,Yeah.
00:20:55,00:20:56,But it used to be cock Tuesday.
00:20:56,00:20:57,Cock Tuesday.
00:20:57,00:20:58,Okay.
00:20:58,00:20:59,Yeah.
00:20:59,00:21:00,Do we find out why it's cock Tuesday?
00:21:00,00:21:02,"Oh, I assumed it was you just ate a lot of meat."
00:21:02,00:21:03,"God, I didn't actually..."
00:21:03,00:21:08,"You ate a lot of meat, so you call it cock Tuesday, because that's the real meat, isn't"
00:21:08,00:21:09,it?
00:21:09,00:21:10,You're eating cock.
00:21:10,00:21:11,Cock.
00:21:11,00:21:12,Yeah.
00:21:12,00:21:13,Okay.
00:21:13,00:21:14,Is it not?
00:21:14,00:21:15,I've been eating cock on a Tuesday.
00:21:15,00:21:17,That has never been part of Christian tradition.
00:21:17,00:21:20,I'm pretty sure in the Bible it says you're not allowed to eat cock on a Tuesday.
00:21:20,00:21:21,Right.
00:21:21,00:21:22,I think it's in Leviticus.
00:21:22,00:21:23,Yeah.
00:21:23,00:21:24,You're right.
00:21:24,00:21:25,"Yeah, I guess it is that."
00:21:25,00:21:26,Yeah.
00:21:26,00:21:27,Could have been cock fighting.
00:21:27,00:21:28,Yeah.
00:21:28,00:21:29,Could have been cock fighting.
00:21:29,00:21:33,"In fact, I do happen to know that cock fighting did happen on Shrove Tuesday, actually."
00:21:33,00:21:34,Yeah.
00:21:34,00:21:36,"Because it was banned, wasn't it?"
00:21:36,00:21:37,Do you remember?
00:21:37,00:21:38,"This is in our book, haven't I?"
00:21:38,00:21:39,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:21:39,00:21:40,I know.
00:21:40,00:21:45,I'll be fact checking that if James dies before me.
00:21:45,00:21:48,"I mean, when you read about the history of what you're allowed to eat and drink in lent,"
00:21:48,00:21:51,it does give the impression that the Pope has just been inundated throughout time with
00:21:51,00:21:53,"some people knocking in his door going, ""Can I try this?"
00:21:53,00:21:55,"Can I have this?"""
00:21:55,00:21:59,"This beaver, like beaver is always a famous example that says beaver was classified as"
00:21:59,00:22:04,a fish for hundreds of years by the Catholic Church in South America because it swims
00:22:04,00:22:05,a lot.
00:22:05,00:22:08,"And yeah, it's always like and they went to the Pope and they said, ""Pope, are we allowed"
00:22:08,00:22:09,"to do this one?"""
00:22:09,00:22:11,It's just like they find a new animal.
00:22:11,00:22:12,Yeah.
00:22:12,00:22:13,"They're like, ""Find a dog bill platypus."
00:22:13,00:22:14,"Pope!"""
00:22:14,00:22:15,Yeah.
00:22:15,00:22:16,Come and look at this.
00:22:16,00:22:17,"Come on, it's in water."
00:22:17,00:22:18,That'd be amazing.
00:22:18,00:22:19,Yeah.
00:22:19,00:22:20,They're like a group of people admins.
00:22:20,00:22:23,They just try to prove or say no to it.
00:22:23,00:22:29,Iguanas was a big one when the Spanish went over to South America because they spent a
00:22:29,00:22:30,lot of time in water.
00:22:30,00:22:33,"They said, ""Pope, can we eat this?"""
00:22:33,00:22:35,"And the Pope said, ""Yes."""
00:22:35,00:22:41,"Even though the black iguana was the one that people ate, which was a land iguana, on the"
00:22:41,00:22:45,rules that the green one spent time in water.
00:22:45,00:22:47,So iguanas are kind of fishy things.
00:22:47,00:22:48,So it was a double loop.
00:22:48,00:22:49,All right.
00:22:49,00:22:53,"Because his cousin sometimes likes to swim, so we'll eat this guy."
00:22:53,00:22:54,Exactly.
00:22:54,00:22:55,Yeah.
00:22:55,00:23:00,Sometimes the Pope comes out with some suggestions for what you can do during Lent.
00:23:00,00:23:04,"2020, what do you think he said to give up for Lent?"
00:23:04,00:23:05,Face masks.
00:23:05,00:23:06,Condoms.
00:23:06,00:23:07,Yeah.
00:23:07,00:23:11,It's going to be too hard to do.
00:23:11,00:23:12,Okay.
00:23:12,00:23:13,What could you give up for Lent?
00:23:13,00:23:14,I bet.
00:23:14,00:23:15,No.
00:23:15,00:23:16,They're trying to be cool.
00:23:16,00:23:17,It's 2020.
00:23:17,00:23:18,Yeah.
00:23:18,00:23:20,"It's kind of, you're in the right territory."
00:23:20,00:23:21,"A lot of people are online, I guess."
00:23:21,00:23:22,They're at home.
00:23:22,00:23:23,Yeah.
00:23:23,00:23:24,It's 2020.
00:23:24,00:23:29,Masterbating online on Zoom with the rest of the monks.
00:23:29,00:23:31,Yeah.
00:23:31,00:23:33,It was very close.
00:23:33,00:23:34,Hashtags.
00:23:34,00:23:35,Hashtags.
00:23:35,00:23:36,No.
00:23:36,00:23:37,Hashtags.
00:23:37,00:23:38,"Look, come on."
00:23:38,00:23:39,We can get this.
00:23:39,00:23:40,"You can get it, but it's kind of a boring answer."
00:23:40,00:23:41,A carder.
00:23:41,00:23:44,Is it scheduling Zoom meetings for sort of nine o'clock in the morning?
00:23:44,00:23:45,"Oh, yeah."
00:23:45,00:23:46,We'll just get into work.
00:23:46,00:23:47,Okay.
00:23:47,00:23:48,We're in the territory.
00:23:48,00:23:53,"Just remember, a lot of people spending time online and online is a very scary place sometimes."
00:23:53,00:23:54,Twitter?
00:23:54,00:23:56,"Oh, those online quizzes, they were all over the place."
00:23:56,00:23:57,Yeah.
00:23:57,00:24:01,"No, no, it's online comedy shows."
00:24:01,00:24:02,Yeah.
00:24:02,00:24:06,Is it just like take some time out from the internet?
00:24:06,00:24:07,It's trolling.
00:24:07,00:24:08,Oh.
00:24:08,00:24:12,"So, take time off from sending negative messages out into the world."
00:24:12,00:24:13,Trolls stop your anger.
00:24:13,00:24:15,"That's like saying, don't murder people."
00:24:15,00:24:16,Yeah.
00:24:16,00:24:17,"Like, stop doing it, full stop."
00:24:17,00:24:20,And then you can have a massive troll at the end of the day.
00:24:20,00:24:21,Just go online abuse it.
00:24:21,00:24:22,Everyone you can find.
00:24:22,00:24:25,"I'll tell you what, on the cock Tuesday, you can all be cocks online."
00:24:25,00:24:26,"Yeah, yeah."
00:24:26,00:24:27,That's where it comes from.
00:24:27,00:24:29,That's what he said.
00:24:29,00:24:34,"If you all stop just for a month, then the world will be a better place."
00:24:34,00:24:36,And then you can all go back to being fucking losers.
00:24:36,00:24:38,"All right, stop now."
00:24:38,00:24:42,Do you guys know about mop eggs?
00:24:42,00:24:43,Mop eggs.
00:24:43,00:24:44,Mop.
00:24:44,00:24:45,"Mop eggs, actually."
00:24:45,00:24:46,Mop eggs.
00:24:46,00:24:48,But I want to know also what you think a mop egg would be.
00:24:48,00:24:50,That sounds fun.
00:24:50,00:24:56,"It's a mop egg, an egg, which is pretending to be a mop."
00:24:56,00:25:00,"You're thinking of the mop, mop egg."
00:25:00,00:25:01,Yeah.
00:25:01,00:25:02,Just under the dictionary.
00:25:02,00:25:06,"It's something that's not really an egg, because you can't eat eggs over lent."
00:25:06,00:25:07,Yeah.
00:25:07,00:25:08,But you eat this particular thing instead.
00:25:08,00:25:09,Yes.
00:25:09,00:25:10,Which is...
00:25:10,00:25:12,You can probably guess it.
00:25:12,00:25:13,Okay.
00:25:13,00:25:14,You can't guess it.
00:25:14,00:25:15,I'll take it back.
00:25:15,00:25:16,Hang on.
00:25:16,00:25:17,It's a food.
00:25:17,00:25:18,"Oh, is it?"
00:25:18,00:25:19,I know what it'll be.
00:25:19,00:25:20,What's the aqua favor?
00:25:20,00:25:22,You are close.
00:25:22,00:25:26,"But because, as I think we probably have mentioned, the concept of aqua favor was invented about"
00:25:26,00:25:27,four years ago.
00:25:27,00:25:29,And this comes from the 1450s.
00:25:29,00:25:30,It wasn't that.
00:25:30,00:25:34,"So, was it something that you can use instead of eggs?"
00:25:34,00:25:35,It was something that you used to make.
00:25:35,00:25:39,"And it's a recipe for making a mop egg, because you couldn't eat animal products that included"
00:25:39,00:25:40,egg.
00:25:40,00:25:44,"And it was extremely popular, much more popular than dairy milk throughout medieval times"
00:25:44,00:25:45,was almond milk.
00:25:45,00:25:46,"Oh, yeah."
00:25:46,00:25:49,And that's partly because you could eat that still in lent.
00:25:49,00:25:51,And so you filled an empty egg shell.
00:25:51,00:25:55,"Now, I don't know how you got the egg shell really empty, and then to a place where you"
00:25:55,00:25:56,could fill it again.
00:25:56,00:25:57,"Oh, just a tiny hole."
00:25:57,00:25:58,Yeah.
00:25:58,00:25:59,Crick a hole.
00:25:59,00:26:00,One in each end.
00:26:00,00:26:01,And then blow it.
00:26:01,00:26:02,But then you have to fill it up with...
00:26:02,00:26:03,Okay.
00:26:03,00:26:04,Slightly bigger hole.
00:26:04,00:26:05,A little thicker hole.
00:26:05,00:26:06,Okay.
00:26:06,00:26:07,Make a hole in your egg.
00:26:07,00:26:08,Empty it.
00:26:08,00:26:12,"So, almond milk based jelly, and then real almonds in the middle dyed yellow with saffron."
00:26:12,00:26:17,"So, you've got crunchy almonds in the middle yellow, and then grey almond jelly outside."
00:26:17,00:26:19,And it looks like a shit egg.
00:26:19,00:26:20,Right.
00:26:20,00:26:25,"By the way, apparently this is just calling back to the last fact, you shouldn't blow"
00:26:25,00:26:28,air up a vagina when someone's pregnant.
00:26:28,00:26:29,That's true.
00:26:29,00:26:34,"I mean, honestly, if you're going to do it, ask permission anyway, whether they're pregnant"
00:26:34,00:26:35,or not.
00:26:35,00:26:37,"Yeah, that is dangerous, isn't it?"
00:26:37,00:26:38,I've heard that.
00:26:38,00:26:39,Is it?
00:26:39,00:26:41,"Well, actually, you know what?"
00:26:41,00:26:42,I've never checked it.
00:26:42,00:26:43,Yeah.
00:26:43,00:26:44,But it's the kind of thing you hear.
00:26:44,00:26:46,It's the kind of thing you hear in the playground.
00:26:46,00:26:47,Really?
00:26:47,00:26:48,"Yeah, yeah."
00:26:48,00:26:51,Didn't you hear it went to a cool school?
00:26:51,00:26:55,"So, fillet of fish, McDonald's."
00:26:55,00:26:56,"Oh, yeah."
00:26:56,00:26:58,"Lydia, you and I were talking about this."
00:26:58,00:27:00,"Yeah, it's a byproduct of Catholic fasting."
00:27:00,00:27:04,"So, it was developed in 1962 by a man called Lou Grun."
00:27:04,00:27:09,He ran the Cincinnati franchise and couldn't sell burgers on Fridays or during Lent because
00:27:09,00:27:11,most of his customers were Catholic.
00:27:11,00:27:15,"And so, he came up with this idea of this horrible burger."
00:27:15,00:27:17,"Sorry, I'm sure it's great."
00:27:17,00:27:22,"And now, a days, about 25% of the fillet of fish is bought by McDonald's customers in"
00:27:22,00:27:24,any one year are bought during the 40 days of Lent.
00:27:24,00:27:25,No.
00:27:25,00:27:26,Nobody buys in the rest of the year.
00:27:26,00:27:27,Really?
00:27:27,00:27:28,Yeah.
00:27:28,00:27:29,That's so interesting.
00:27:29,00:27:32,"Yeah, I wouldn't have thought there were that many devout Catholics going to McDonald's."
00:27:32,00:27:34,"In America, there's loads."
00:27:34,00:27:36,There's some places that don't even sell them outside of Lent.
00:27:36,00:27:38,They just wait for Lent and then they bring it back on the menu.
00:27:38,00:27:39,Really?
00:27:39,00:27:40,That's amazing.
00:27:40,00:27:43,"And this guy, Grun, he developed them in 1962."
00:27:43,00:27:47,"So, Ray Kroc had taken over McDonald's in '61."
00:27:47,00:27:51,"And so, they basically had a competition between them because he, Ray Kroc, had come up with"
00:27:51,00:27:56,"his own burger at the same time, which was a non-meat burger called the Hula Burger, which"
00:27:56,00:27:57,I believe we've mentioned before.
00:27:57,00:27:58,Hula hoops.
00:27:58,00:27:59,"Yeah, it was Hula Hoops."
00:27:59,00:28:02,And it was grilled pineapple with cheese on a cold bun.
00:28:02,00:28:07,"And so, he said whoever sells the most will be on the permanent menu after a bit of time"
00:28:07,00:28:09,"and fill it, oh, fish, one out."
00:28:09,00:28:13,Do you know whether there's more birthday parties than any other McDonald's in the world?
00:28:13,00:28:15,Because I've been there this year.
00:28:15,00:28:17,"Oh, he's been there this year."
00:28:17,00:28:19,He's Bolton.
00:28:19,00:28:22,Marrakesh?
00:28:22,00:28:24,"No, not Marrakesh."
00:28:24,00:28:25,Montenegro?
00:28:25,00:28:27,"Montenegro's close, but not quite right."
00:28:27,00:28:28,Serbia.
00:28:28,00:28:29,Capital.
00:28:29,00:28:30,Belgrade.
00:28:30,00:28:31,Belgrade.
00:28:31,00:28:32,Correct.
00:28:32,00:28:33,St. Belgrade.
00:28:33,00:28:34,Is it?
00:28:34,00:28:35,Yeah.
00:28:35,00:28:39,"And it's because basically when McDonald's passed the Iron Curtain, it was just so popular."
00:28:39,00:28:44,"I really like watching because both you, Lydia and James are quizzes and you do things like"
00:28:44,00:28:45,only connect.
00:28:45,00:28:46,That was like training.
00:28:46,00:28:51,"I was going to say, can you edit out the dead air before I remember that Belgrade was the"
00:28:51,00:28:52,capital of Serbia?
00:28:52,00:28:56,But Serbia was the place where the Golden Arch's diplomacy rule got broken.
00:28:56,00:28:57,"Oh, what's that?"
00:28:57,00:29:01,"Oh, so there's a sort of philosophical idea that no two countries with McDonald's had"
00:29:01,00:29:03,ever gone to war with each other.
00:29:03,00:29:04,Oh.
00:29:04,00:29:10,"Well, this was, I'm not sure how true it ever was, but there was this idea that if a country"
00:29:10,00:29:13,"has a McDonald's, they probably weren't going to go to war with each other."
00:29:13,00:29:14,Yeah.
00:29:14,00:29:18,"And after somebody put it in an academic article a few weeks, NATO bombed Serbia."
00:29:18,00:29:19,Wow.
00:29:19,00:29:22,"And so the Golden Arch's rule, if it ever really existed, was broken at that point."
00:29:22,00:29:24,Can I quickly talk about bimicles?
00:29:24,00:29:25,Yeah.
00:29:25,00:29:26,They're enormous penises.
00:29:26,00:29:27,"Yes, please."
00:29:27,00:29:28,Always.
00:29:28,00:29:33,So they have the largest penis to body ratio in the world.
00:29:33,00:29:34,Okay.
00:29:34,00:29:40,"They, one reason is because they don't move around very much because they just kind of"
00:29:40,00:29:45,"attached to things, but they do sort of internal copulation."
00:29:45,00:29:51,"So if you're stuck where you are, imagine your feet are nailed to the ground and you"
00:29:51,00:29:54,want to have sex with someone who's three or four feet away and their feet are nailed
00:29:54,00:29:55,to the ground.
00:29:55,00:30:00,The only way you're going to do that realistically is with a very long penis.
00:30:00,00:30:02,And so that's what they did.
00:30:02,00:30:03,That's what they've evolved.
00:30:03,00:30:11,"We had a great sketch of a married couple barnacles, but there's just a random guy in"
00:30:11,00:30:16,"between them, just every night he just watches a penis come over the front of him."
00:30:16,00:30:17,Like when you're on an aeroplane.
00:30:17,00:30:18,Yeah.
00:30:18,00:30:22,And they put two of you in like one seat away from each other and sit someone random in
00:30:22,00:30:23,the middle.
00:30:23,00:30:24,Yeah.
00:30:24,00:30:26,You're just passing multisers to each other.
00:30:26,00:30:31,"Well, it's, if you can imagine that with penises and barnacles, then that's what happens."
00:30:31,00:30:37,"But very recently they found out that Gooseneck barnacles, which I'm not sure if it's the same"
00:30:37,00:30:44,"as the, these ones, but I think it might be, they do something called sperm casting, which"
00:30:44,00:30:48,isn't a new podcast.
00:30:48,00:30:53,"It's where you ejaculate into the water and the water sort of finds its way to a, to a"
00:30:53,00:30:54,female.
00:30:54,00:30:55,Yeah.
00:30:55,00:30:56,That sounds sensible.
00:30:56,00:30:57,That's a good way of doing it.
00:30:57,00:31:01,But what the result is that they have evolved much shorter and less stretchy penises.
00:31:01,00:31:06,"Oh no, less stretchy as well."
00:31:06,00:31:07,So that's what happens.
00:31:07,00:31:10,"They've, they've kind of come up with this new way of mating, but at the expense of their"
00:31:10,00:31:11,penis stretchiness.
00:31:11,00:31:12,Oh no.
00:31:12,00:31:13,Poor them.
00:31:13,00:31:16,"A stretchiness kind of, I, to stretch something, I imagine someone has to be pulling at the"
00:31:16,00:31:20,"other end and they had to get a fish and be like, can you come over here?"
00:31:20,00:31:21,Sorry.
00:31:21,00:31:22,I just want to get this to that girl over there.
00:31:22,00:31:23,Can you just swim it over?
00:31:23,00:31:24,That won't reach.
00:31:24,00:31:25,I promise it will.
00:31:25,00:31:33,We've actually never mentioned the essential role that barnacles played in Britain's kind
00:31:33,00:31:35,of historic reputation.
00:31:35,00:31:41,"And basically us ruling the waves was really down to barnacles, or specifically down to"
00:31:41,00:31:45,"our defeating them, because they're such a huge problem for ships."
00:31:45,00:31:50,"So they glue themselves with this really powerful glue to the hulls of ships, and it means that"
00:31:50,00:31:55,"ships need to use a huge amount more fuel, up to 40% more fuel, just to get going with"
00:31:55,00:31:56,a huge weight and drama.
00:31:56,00:31:58,"Oh, so it's the weights, right."
00:31:58,00:32:03,"It's called biofouling, and it's, it's a huge problem, it's not just a word, James"
00:32:03,00:32:04,Goodson.
00:32:04,00:32:05,Good word.
00:32:05,00:32:06,It's a great word.
00:32:06,00:32:07,Biofouling.
00:32:07,00:32:12,"They biofoul, and in the 18th century, it was the British who realized that if you sheath"
00:32:12,00:32:18,"your hulls in copper, the barnacles can't adhere to it, don't adhere to it."
00:32:18,00:32:21,"And that was completely revolutionary, and that was what made Britain this naval superpower,"
00:32:21,00:32:23,one of the essential things.
00:32:23,00:32:30,"But it is a problem again now, because we stopped making boats out of copper, and they're back."
00:32:30,00:32:34,But I do wonder if that's why blistering barnacles is an expletive at sea.
00:32:34,00:32:35,In Tintin.
00:32:35,00:32:36,In Tintin.
00:32:36,00:32:37,Not sure.
00:32:37,00:32:45,In one very specific Belgian kid's comic book.
00:32:45,00:32:52,"Okay, it is time for fact number three, and that is my fact."
00:32:52,00:32:57,"My fact this week is that just after the Titanic hit the iceberg, many of the first class passengers"
00:32:57,00:33:02,sprung into action and immediately organized snowball fights for the next morning.
00:33:02,00:33:03,Wow.
00:33:03,00:33:04,Yeah.
00:33:04,00:33:05,Yeah.
00:33:05,00:33:10,"I mean, just to sort of show how non-threatening they thought the moment was, I found this"
00:33:10,00:33:12,fact in a really bizarre place.
00:33:12,00:33:17,"I'm reading a book at the moment called ""Poking the Dead Frog"", which is by a guy called"
00:33:17,00:33:18,Mike Sackwack.
00:33:18,00:33:24,"No, it's by Mike Sacks, who's it's an amazing book."
00:33:24,00:33:27,"If you're into comedy history, it's interviews with great comedy writers."
00:33:27,00:33:32,"And it was within an interview with a guy called Henry Beard, who started National Lampoon."
00:33:32,00:33:35,"He was part of and board of the rings, the first Lord of the Rings parody."
00:33:35,00:33:36,It's just in there.
00:33:36,00:33:40,"He just says my dad was friends with a guy called Lawrence Beasley, and he was a survivor"
00:33:40,00:33:42,of the Titanic.
00:33:42,00:33:47,And then there's a footnote that tells that in an account given in Lawrence Beasley's
00:33:47,00:33:53,"book, which is titled ""Blistering Barnacles, the Lost""."
00:33:53,00:33:54,See.
00:33:54,00:34:00,"So it's called ""The loss of the Titanic"", it's the sort of real downer of a reveal"
00:34:00,00:34:01,of the actual title.
00:34:01,00:34:03,"Yeah, you missed the trick there, sort of thing."
00:34:03,00:34:08,"The loss of the SS Titanic, its story and its lessons by one of the survivors."
00:34:08,00:34:13,"And yeah, he said that as soon as the hit occurred, to illustrate further how little"
00:34:13,00:34:17,"danger was apprehended, when it was discovered on the first class deck that the forward lower"
00:34:17,00:34:21,"deck was covered with small ice, snowballing matches were arranged for the following morning,"
00:34:21,00:34:25,and some passengers even went down to the deck and brought back small pieces of ice which
00:34:25,00:34:26,were handed round.
00:34:26,00:34:29,"Okay, so question."
00:34:29,00:34:33,These are presumably bits of iceberg that have fallen on their deck.
00:34:33,00:34:38,"Snowball fights, to me, is safer at least if you use snow rather than ice."
00:34:38,00:34:39,Yes.
00:34:39,00:34:42,"Yeah, you always get annoyed with the person who picks up a chunk of ice, and there's"
00:34:42,00:34:44,always one kid who throws it.
00:34:44,00:34:45,I actually was thinking about that as well.
00:34:45,00:34:51,"I think possibly what happened is that the ice was almost grated, so lots of powder,"
00:34:51,00:34:54,"as it were, was coming down."
00:34:54,00:34:55,Like a frozen martini.
00:34:55,00:34:56,Exactly.
00:34:56,00:34:57,Yeah.
00:34:57,00:35:02,And a lot of the other passengers planned the frozen martini party for the next morning.
00:35:02,00:35:03,That's interesting.
00:35:03,00:35:08,"Yeah, I think it definitely was shaving, because actually at the time, according to the newspaper"
00:35:08,00:35:13,"reports from the next day, they said the deck was filled with ice and snow, which had been"
00:35:13,00:35:18,"shaved off, and passengers were amusing themselves by throwing them around at each other immediately."
00:35:18,00:35:19,"Yeah, exactly."
00:35:19,00:35:23,"I heard playing football as well with the snow, with the ice, like lumps of ice kicking"
00:35:23,00:35:24,it at each other.
00:35:24,00:35:25,"Just sliding it along, yeah."
00:35:25,00:35:31,"And there was a stoker called Walter Hurst, and I read that he entered some fellow stoker's"
00:35:31,00:35:34,cabin and threw lumps of ice at them to wake them up.
00:35:34,00:35:38,"So Lawrence Beasley, we've kind of mentioned him on the show before in passing."
00:35:38,00:35:41,"He was, we talked about survivor guilt."
00:35:41,00:35:46,"A lot of the people that survived the Titanic believed that maybe, particularly if they"
00:35:46,00:35:51,"were male, I think almost, really almost exclusively if they were male, they should have gone down"
00:35:51,00:35:52,with it.
00:35:52,00:35:55,Lawrence Beasley survived because he was standing on the side where the last boats were going
00:35:55,00:36:00,"down, and a rumour went round that they were now taking men off the boat on the other side"
00:36:00,00:36:01,of the Titanic.
00:36:01,00:36:04,"So everyone ran around, but he just hung out there."
00:36:04,00:36:05,He just didn't go.
00:36:05,00:36:07,This is his story.
00:36:07,00:36:09,And then they said there's more space as you could get in.
00:36:09,00:36:14,"So he jumped in that one, and that's how he survived, not knowing that that was a lie,"
00:36:14,00:36:16,that there weren't any other on the other side.
00:36:16,00:36:21,"And so he survives, and he had survivor's guilt a bit to the point where he jumped onto"
00:36:21,00:36:25,the set of a movie of the Titanic that was being filmed.
00:36:25,00:36:29,And he tried to symbolically go down with the iceberg.
00:36:29,00:36:31,"Nope, not the same mate."
00:36:31,00:36:32,Sorry.
00:36:32,00:36:36,"Yeah, he was a lot of, a lot of, and he got caught."
00:36:36,00:36:37,They kicked him off the set.
00:36:37,00:36:39,So he survived that Titanic.
00:36:39,00:36:45,"Yeah, his grandson talks about the fact that it was a thing back then more so, he says"
00:36:45,00:36:50,"more so than any other time where it was women and children first was not just like a thing,"
00:36:50,00:36:51,a suggestion.
00:36:51,00:36:52,It was built into you.
00:36:52,00:36:56,"I read that it was quite controversial, even during and immediately after the sinking,"
00:36:56,00:37:01,"this women and children idea, because the men obviously were the breadwinners."
00:37:01,00:37:04,"They brought home all the resources, so if you didn't bring your husband with you onto"
00:37:04,00:37:07,"the boat, then you would be poor and destitute."
00:37:07,00:37:12,So there was some arguing amongst survivors and people trying to get off the boat about
00:37:12,00:37:15,"whether it should be, should the men be left on the boat and leave the women and children"
00:37:15,00:37:16,destitute?
00:37:16,00:37:17,What's better?
00:37:17,00:37:22,"And they said, it's not women and children first as the law of the sea, but it is inherent"
00:37:22,00:37:23,law of human nature.
00:37:23,00:37:24,Okay.
00:37:24,00:37:25,Interesting.
00:37:25,00:37:30,"So they should have done a sort of like, means, or an IQ test or something to see who"
00:37:30,00:37:31,are the most useful breadwinners.
00:37:31,00:37:35,"Some sort of mean tested survival, I'm sure would have been completely straightforward."
00:37:35,00:37:36,A quick quiz.
00:37:36,00:37:37,"A quick quiz, Lydia."
00:37:37,00:37:38,"Yes, quiz."
00:37:38,00:37:39,"Yeah, quiz."
00:37:39,00:37:40,That sounds good.
00:37:40,00:37:42,"If you can name a capital of Serbia, you are."
00:37:42,00:37:43,Capital of Zagreb.
00:37:43,00:37:44,Damn it.
00:37:44,00:37:45,Capital of Zagreb.
00:37:45,00:37:46,"Sorry about going down, Dan."
00:37:46,00:37:47,Just throw yourself over.
00:37:47,00:37:48,I was panicking.
00:37:48,00:37:54,I put myself as survival mode.
00:37:54,00:37:58,"Interesting little connection between this guy as well, Beasley, is that his son Alec"
00:37:58,00:38:04,was married to a writer called Dodie Smith and she's who wrote 101 Dalmatians.
00:38:04,00:38:05,Really?
00:38:05,00:38:10,"Yeah, just a little, it's no presidential connection, but it's pretty good going."
00:38:10,00:38:15,"Speaking of people with survivors guilt, another one was a person who is the coward of the"
00:38:15,00:38:16,Titanic.
00:38:16,00:38:18,So who do you guys think of as the coward of this whole story?
00:38:18,00:38:19,Isme?
00:38:19,00:38:20,Isme?
00:38:20,00:38:21,Billy Zeg.
00:38:21,00:38:22,Exactly.
00:38:22,00:38:23,Okay.
00:38:23,00:38:28,"Lydia's is historically accurate, yours is based on the film, so I'm going to go with"
00:38:28,00:38:29,Isme.
00:38:29,00:38:32,"Yeah, Bruce Isme, who was the head of White Star Line, who was the guy who apparently"
00:38:32,00:38:35,or expected to encourage them to keep the ship going faster so they could make the morning
00:38:35,00:38:36,headlines.
00:38:36,00:38:41,"You know, and in all adaptations of Titanic, he is the villain, the Panto villain, because"
00:38:41,00:38:47,"he kind of was the reason it crashed and then he escaped onto a lifeboat, snuck onto a lifeboat."
00:38:47,00:38:51,"And he's not, and I just feel like he should be rehabilitated."
00:38:51,00:38:56,"So the reason that he's this pantomime villain still today is because William Randolph Hearst,"
00:38:56,00:39:00,"who owned all the newspapers at the time, they were influential, just hated him."
00:39:00,00:39:07,"Isme was this quite cold, awkward Brit, Hearst was the American guy, and he just ran this"
00:39:07,00:39:10,smear campaign almost immediately after the Titanic sank.
00:39:10,00:39:14,He made his papers publish the suggestion that the emblem of White Star be changed to
00:39:14,00:39:19,"yellow liver in, you know, testament to his cowardice."
00:39:19,00:39:21,"And actually he, we have no evidence that he did that."
00:39:21,00:39:23,It was reported that he did his duty completely.
00:39:23,00:39:29,"He was on the very last lifeboat to leave and, come on, it's the driver, the captain."
00:39:29,00:39:30,Where was he in all this?
00:39:30,00:39:33,He was hiding away in that room that exploded with water.
00:39:33,00:39:34,Is it?
00:39:34,00:39:37,"I haven't seen any of the movies, but it seems to me like the bad guy would be the iceberg."
00:39:37,00:39:38,Is that not?
00:39:38,00:39:41,"The iceberg was just doing its duty, James."
00:39:41,00:39:42,"Oh, is it?"
00:39:42,00:39:45,"Yeah, it's what it was born to do, sink ships."
00:39:45,00:39:48,"So a lot of people went to testify about what the experience was, just so we could get it"
00:39:48,00:39:52,"down in history books, and people were trying to get money from the company as well for"
00:39:52,00:39:54,the disaster.
00:39:54,00:39:58,"And one woman, basically, it reads like the worst trip advisor review ever."
00:39:58,00:40:02,"It's just her, it's like, it takes ages for her to get to the actual incident itself."
00:40:02,00:40:06,"Like the food was shit, the gym wasn't big enough."
00:40:06,00:40:10,"We were put into a third-class room, we should have been in a different room, it was barely"
00:40:10,00:40:13,"enough room to get two people in there, let alone the three people that we had, the meals"
00:40:13,00:40:15,were not being served correctly.
00:40:15,00:40:19,"But then she does make this point that when they did hit, she sent her son off."
00:40:19,00:40:21,"Sorry, did she actually complain about stuff before?"
00:40:21,00:40:22,Genuinely.
00:40:22,00:40:23,Wow.
00:40:23,00:40:26,"That's what I mean, it's like a huge long, yeah, yeah, it's a proper trip advisor, two"
00:40:26,00:40:27,stars.
00:40:27,00:40:28,That's so funny.
00:40:28,00:40:29,Two stars?
00:40:29,00:40:30,Really?
00:40:30,00:40:31,What does it have to do to get one study?
00:40:31,00:40:36,"But she then also, she says that her son goes up, finds the captain, and he's in a card"
00:40:36,00:40:37,game and he laughs it off.
00:40:37,00:40:40,"He says, ""Oh, this is nothing,"" and she goes back there."
00:40:40,00:40:44,"Then it goes to complaints about her going, ""The boat that we were put down in, the life"
00:40:44,00:40:48,"raft, that was a nightmare, get it into that, the lowering of it, they didn't know what"
00:40:48,00:40:49,they were doing.
00:40:49,00:40:51,"It was on the boat on top of us, almost crashed into us."""
00:40:51,00:40:56,"To be fair, you're putting a lot of tone on this, that maybe one of the guys was in"
00:40:56,00:41:01,"one of those reviews that had the Plasagg response from White Star Line saying, ""Well,"
00:41:01,00:41:05,"you paid for the first class ticket, we will acknowledge we hit the iceberg."""
00:41:05,00:41:11,"Yeah, thank you for your feedback, we relish any kind of feedback that we get for any of"
00:41:11,00:41:12,our liners.
00:41:12,00:41:13,So funny.
00:41:13,00:41:15,Have you heard of a woman named Violet Jessup?
00:41:15,00:41:16,"Violet Jessup, no."
00:41:16,00:41:22,"She survived the sinking of not only the Titanic, but also the Britannic in 1916, and she was"
00:41:22,00:41:27,"aboard the third sister ship, the Olympic, when it collided with another boat and nearly"
00:41:27,00:41:30,sank in 1911.
00:41:30,00:41:35,"And she later wrote a memoir where she complained that after the Titanic sank, she got the"
00:41:35,00:41:39,"mick taken out of her because she couldn't find a toothbrush, and she was complaining"
00:41:39,00:41:43,"all the time about not having a toothbrush, and so the other survivors just started making"
00:41:43,00:41:44,fun of her.
00:41:44,00:41:46,"Hang on, when the Titanic was sinking?"
00:41:46,00:41:49,"After she was on the ship, after it was the Carpathia, she'd forgotten to take her toothbrush"
00:41:49,00:41:53,"with her, and so she just kept complaining that nobody would give her a toothbrush."
00:41:53,00:41:58,"So when the Britannic sank later, the first thing she did when it started sinking was"
00:41:58,00:42:02,"she ran to get her toothbrush because she said a friend had told her, ""Never undertake"
00:42:02,00:42:05,"another disaster without first making sure of your toothbrush."""
00:42:05,00:42:08,"Wow, I can't believe that's the lesson she took away from being on the Titanic because"
00:42:08,00:42:09,it sank.
00:42:09,00:42:12,That's mainly what she talks about.
00:42:12,00:42:15,"Because she's thought, well, what I'm going to do is make sure I bring a toothbrush next"
00:42:15,00:42:19,"time, whereas what I might think is don't get on a massive fucking ship."
00:42:19,00:42:23,Being an ick.
00:42:23,00:42:27,Do you guys know who the original captain of the Titanic was?
00:42:27,00:42:30,"The original captain, as in not the one who then was the captain?"
00:42:30,00:42:31,"No, so Smith."
00:42:31,00:42:32,Edward Smith?
00:42:32,00:42:36,"Edward Smith was the captain when it was sailing, but actually when it was being assembled"
00:42:36,00:42:37,in Belfast.
00:42:37,00:42:38,Okay.
00:42:38,00:42:41,I'm just thinking it's quite an easy job to be a captain of a ship while it's being
00:42:41,00:42:42,built.
00:42:42,00:42:43,Yeah.
00:42:43,00:42:44,Most of the work does come in once it's at the sea.
00:42:44,00:42:48,"Oh, it's a common misconception, actually the hardest part is standing there watching"
00:42:48,00:42:49,it being built.
00:42:49,00:42:55,"No, I had a master in Belfast who was largely responsible for assembling the crew together"
00:42:55,00:42:58,to get it to Southampton where it went off to.
00:42:58,00:43:00,"So he captained it to Southampton, is that what you're saying?"
00:43:00,00:43:01,He actually didn't.
00:43:01,00:43:02,He just got the crew together.
00:43:02,00:43:03,Okay.
00:43:03,00:43:08,"But he was officially captain of the Titanic, and he was captain Hadek."
00:43:08,00:43:09,Blistering barnacles.
00:43:09,00:43:11,Are you kidding me?
00:43:11,00:43:14,Captain Herbert Hadek.
00:43:14,00:43:18,The first captain of the Titanic.
00:43:18,00:43:20,Isn't that quite bizarre?
00:43:20,00:43:21,That is something.
00:43:21,00:43:23,"Well, isn't that incredibly famous?"
00:43:23,00:43:26,What a shame he didn't take it all the way to the end.
00:43:26,00:43:28,Do you know the link between Titanic and North Korea?
00:43:28,00:43:29,"Oh, is it?"
00:43:29,00:43:31,I feel like you might know.
00:43:31,00:43:35,"Both had a McDonald's, and is it a white star?"
00:43:35,00:43:36,No.
00:43:36,00:43:43,"The HMS Titanic sank on the same day that Kim Il-sung was born, which is April 15, 1912."
00:43:43,00:43:44,You're right.
00:43:44,00:43:45,I do know.
00:43:45,00:43:46,Yes.
00:43:46,00:43:47,The birthdays of all dictators.
00:43:47,00:43:48,"Well, it just seems like you're a quiz-er."
00:43:48,00:43:50,It's the kind of thing that comes up.
00:43:50,00:43:54,I feel like that he has just declared war on this day.
00:43:54,00:43:55,Right!
00:43:55,00:44:00,The QI Festival of Democracy has been broken.
00:44:00,00:44:01,"Oh, yeah."
00:44:01,00:44:04,"So the North Korean calendar starts from April 15, 1912."
00:44:04,00:44:05,"Yeah, yeah."
00:44:05,00:44:06,I know all this.
00:44:06,00:44:07,Come on.
00:44:07,00:44:10,Tell me something I don't know.
00:44:10,00:44:13,But for a crana.
00:44:13,00:44:15,"No, I do know that."
00:44:15,00:44:16,"They start with his birth, don't they?"
00:44:16,00:44:17,"Yes, they start with his birth."
00:44:17,00:44:23,"And I tried to find out what time he was born, because obviously it sank in the Atlantic,"
00:44:23,00:44:27,"and Korea is, I don't know what time zones were like in 1912, but several hours ahead"
00:44:27,00:44:31,said it could possibly have been born at the moment of the sinking.
00:44:31,00:44:33,Do you think there's a connection?
00:44:33,00:44:35,"I do, but I'm not going to go into it here."
00:44:35,00:44:36,What was that?
00:44:36,00:44:39,Get on Dan's other podcast.
00:44:39,00:44:42,"Can I just quickly, very, very quickly say that in 19..."
00:44:42,00:44:50,"There was a 1962 law in the town of Owasau in America, which banned children from throwing"
00:44:50,00:44:52,snowballs at each other.
00:44:52,00:44:53,Why?
00:44:53,00:44:54,Because it hurts.
00:44:54,00:44:58,"And I think the idea was that, you know, it stopped protesters and stuff, but effectively"
00:44:58,00:45:00,it stopped people from throwing snowballs.
00:45:00,00:45:02,And they eventually changed the rule.
00:45:02,00:45:07,"But what happened was that people heard about this law and they got very, very upset about"
00:45:07,00:45:12,"it and started sort of trolling the city and saying, how come you're stopping kids from"
00:45:12,00:45:13,throwing snowballs?
00:45:13,00:45:15,It's disgusting.
00:45:15,00:45:20,And one of the people who's in charge said that the nastiness of it has been incredible.
00:45:20,00:45:25,We haven't seen as much unexpected vitriol since we cracked down on kids selling ice cream
00:45:25,00:45:28,off their backs.
00:45:28,00:45:31,"To be honest, they do sound like the bad guys."
00:45:31,00:45:36,"In the American Civil War, massive organized snowball fights used to happen quite regularly."
00:45:36,00:45:38,Between just the same side?
00:45:38,00:45:39,Same side.
00:45:39,00:45:44,"But it would be, it was usually among the Confederate troops and it would be between different regiments."
00:45:44,00:45:48,"So there was one in 1864 where 20,000 troops took part."
00:45:48,00:45:53,"There were 10,000 on the Georgian and South Carolina side and 10,000 on the Tennessee side."
00:45:53,00:45:54,What?
00:45:54,00:45:55,Yeah.
00:45:55,00:45:56,Yeah.
00:45:56,00:45:57,They were crazy.
00:45:57,00:45:59,That's a lot of people for a snowball fight.
00:45:59,00:46:00,Yeah.
00:46:00,00:46:04,"I don't know how they, but it's so organized and they used to play their bugles properly"
00:46:04,00:46:06,and the officers would be mounted on their horses.
00:46:06,00:46:10,They'd fly their standards and then they'd just gallop at each other.
00:46:10,00:46:11,Very cool.
00:46:11,00:46:12,That's amazing.
00:46:12,00:46:13,Tennessee won if you're interested.
00:46:13,00:46:18,"And if you captured someone from the opposition, then you'd drag them through the snow and"
00:46:18,00:46:22,stuffed snow in their face and nose and eyes and down their back and stuff.
00:46:22,00:46:24,So you didn't want to be captured.
00:46:24,00:46:25,Wow.
00:46:25,00:46:26,Sounds really good.
00:46:26,00:46:27,Good practice for the actual war.
00:46:27,00:46:28,"Oh, not that good."
00:46:28,00:46:29,Practice.
00:46:29,00:46:33,Maybe that's why they didn't win actually.
00:46:33,00:46:36,Not having proper military training.
00:46:36,00:46:37,Yeah.
00:46:37,00:46:41,"First guy comes back going, ""Guys, those bullets hurt way more than the snowballs."
00:46:41,00:46:43,"Heads up."""
00:46:43,00:46:49,Okay.
00:46:49,00:46:52,It is time for our final fact of the show and that is Lydia.
00:46:52,00:46:58,My fact is that entrepreneurs have been ending their business's names with near me in an
00:46:58,00:47:01,attempt to appear near the top of search results.
00:47:01,00:47:02,So that's so good.
00:47:02,00:47:07,"It's like the modern day version of doing the naming your company with the letter A,"
00:47:07,00:47:09,"you know, to get at the top of the phone."
00:47:09,00:47:10,"Bad fact, plumbing."
00:47:10,00:47:11,Yeah.
00:47:11,00:47:12,"Yeah, but is it good?"
00:47:12,00:47:20,"Because let's say this is, you know, a Tex-Mex restaurant in Santa Fe and they're called"
00:47:20,00:47:23,Tex-Mex near me and I Googled it in London.
00:47:23,00:47:24,Yeah.
00:47:24,00:47:25,What fucking use is that?
00:47:25,00:47:26,You'll be on a flight.
00:47:26,00:47:28,"You'll be like, ""Well, I guess it's the closest one."
00:47:28,00:47:29,"I really want to Tex-Mex."""
00:47:29,00:47:33,"A bit further than we were hoping, but I do want it."
00:47:33,00:47:38,"This is exactly, it does work, but the problem is exactly what you have just said is that"
00:47:38,00:47:41,it only works if you're within about a mile.
00:47:41,00:47:46,So I read an article which is about this New York City restaurant called Tie Food Near Me.
00:47:46,00:47:50,"So in NYC in New York City, it works because of the population density."
00:47:50,00:47:53,You're probably very close to things.
00:47:53,00:47:56,Lots of people will be Googling Tie Food Near Me within a mile of this restaurant.
00:47:56,00:48:01,But what's happened to make it really popular is that it's gone viral.
00:48:01,00:48:05,"Lots of people have been looking at it thinking, ""This is a great joke."
00:48:05,00:48:06,"This is such a good idea."""
00:48:06,00:48:09,And that in itself has pushed up the SEO.
00:48:09,00:48:12,So this has taken off in a way that I didn't really realize.
00:48:12,00:48:20,"In Texas alone, there's six businesses called Affordable Dentist Near Me, which is quite bleak."
00:48:20,00:48:23,There's a psychic near me in Chicago.
00:48:23,00:48:25,I have been spending some time.
00:48:25,00:48:28,You've known that already with having to look.
00:48:28,00:48:35,"In the UK, I did a company's house search and there are 90 companies in this country with near me."
00:48:35,00:48:36,Really?
00:48:36,00:48:40,"Including Skip Higher Near Me, Locksmiths Near Me."
00:48:40,00:48:41,Don't come.
00:48:41,00:48:44,Somewhere in New Yorkshire called Cheap Flooring Near Me.
00:48:44,00:48:48,"And in Oldham, there's a company called Fire Extinguishers Near Me, which means..."
00:48:48,00:48:49,Oh my God.
00:48:49,00:48:52,"You'd think if you need a fire extinguisher, it might be a bit more urgent."
00:48:52,00:48:54,"Yeah, I want one really near me."
00:48:54,00:48:55,"Really, really near me."
00:48:55,00:49:00,"People don't set their house on fire and think, ""Oh, we'd better buy a fire extinguisher."""
00:49:00,00:49:04,"Shit, the shop isn't open for another six hours."
00:49:04,00:49:05,That's why I'm awake.
00:49:05,00:49:06,But you're right.
00:49:06,00:49:10,It's the modern equivalent of naming your business Double-A Plumbing or Triple-A Locksmiths.
00:49:10,00:49:11,"Yeah, yeah."
00:49:11,00:49:16,"And Apple, obviously, I think we've said before, is called Apple because they wanted to be ahead of Atari."
00:49:16,00:49:19,I actually read that you can tell kind of how old a company is.
00:49:19,00:49:21,"Obviously, not really accurately."
00:49:21,00:49:27,"But if it's like hard about plumbing, you know that they came out around the time of Yellow Pages and telephone directories."
00:49:27,00:49:28,"Why? Yeah, yeah."
00:49:28,00:49:35,"If they're called Dan Schreiber Locksmiths, then it came before that when the most important thing was reputation."
00:49:35,00:49:39,"So people would name it after the, you know, the name of the person."
00:49:39,00:49:42,"Probably not Dan Schreiber, though, if I'm being completely honest."
00:49:42,00:49:44,Do you?
00:49:44,00:49:50,"And these days, like in the internet area, you might be more likely to be called, you know, Oxford Plumbing."
00:49:50,00:49:51,Yeah.
00:49:51,00:49:55,Because people are more likely to search for the place or something like that.
00:49:55,00:49:56,Right.
00:49:56,00:49:57,"Interesting, yeah."
00:49:57,00:49:59,"So I don't know if that's true, but I think it's a good rule of thumb."
00:49:59,00:50:04,"Yeah, I tried to, I was on the train when I had this thought and I couldn't get the research done."
00:50:04,00:50:10,But I imagine there must be examples of bands and authors who've taken on pseudonyms to place themselves.
00:50:10,00:50:12,Let's say you're a kid's author.
00:50:12,00:50:16,"Why not make your name ""Rollette"" or something like that and be right next to the Harry Potter books?"
00:50:16,00:50:18,"No, that's what, just write it really."
00:50:18,00:50:19,I think you have to write a good book.
00:50:19,00:50:21,"Yeah, I think that only works."
00:50:21,00:50:25,That's only useful if you write some piece of shit that you want people to accidentally buy.
00:50:25,00:50:26,Yes.
00:50:26,00:50:29,"If you actually want to be a proper good author, you want to be distinct from these people, right?"
00:50:29,00:50:33,"You can't go to your publisher next time, Dan, and be like, ""I've come up with a brilliant concept."""
00:50:33,00:50:36,My name is Richard Usman.
00:50:36,00:50:40,Why did you make your surname start with you?
00:50:40,00:50:44,"Oh yeah, I'm way away from him now."
00:50:45,00:50:49,But the problem is that these things do move on so that wouldn't work anymore.
00:50:49,00:50:54,"And in fact, the near me thing hardly worked for any time at all because as soon as Google catches on,"
00:50:54,00:50:57,"as soon as the internet catches on, it rejigs its algorithm."
00:50:57,00:51:04,"So it doesn't work now because Google has been recoded so that now if you have, if you're called whatever, great dentist near me,"
00:51:04,00:51:10,"Google will discount the words ""near me"" as keywords so it won't look for anything with ""near me"" in the title."
00:51:10,00:51:12,And you've already made all the letterheads.
00:51:13,00:51:15,That just looks stupid.
00:51:15,00:51:19,"So they'll see the words ""near me"" and Google will be like, ""Okay, you want to find something near you."""
00:51:19,00:51:22,So they'll understand what it means but they won't look for the keywords.
00:51:22,00:51:29,"So exactly, same with open now. Don't call your business something something open now because they discount those as well."
00:51:29,00:51:34,"And it's actually counterproductive because honestly, if I saw a business called something something near me,"
00:51:34,00:51:37,I think that's really stupid.
00:51:37,00:51:38,Do you think?
00:51:38,00:51:43,Do you not think it looks quite cheap? Would you go to Thai restaurant near me?
00:51:43,00:51:44,"For the gag, yeah."
00:51:44,00:51:45,You'd go for the gag.
00:51:45,00:51:51,"Would you? I actually thought that Vietnamese restaurant like banh mi, ""near me"" would be like that."
00:51:51,00:51:53,"That's good, well done."
00:51:53,00:51:55,But FireExtinguisherShop open now.
00:51:55,00:51:58,That'd be useful.
00:51:58,00:52:00,But what about when it's not open?
00:52:00,00:52:02,You have to stay open all the time.
00:52:02,00:52:06,"I think if your name is open now, the rules should be that your role is open."
00:52:06,00:52:08,I think I'm attracted to places like that.
00:52:08,00:52:13,"For example, I used to go to a Thai restaurant that was up in North London specifically"
00:52:13,00:52:18,and it wasn't even in my bit of North London because it was called the Titanic genuinely.
00:52:18,00:52:19,"That's great, all right."
00:52:19,00:52:20,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:52:20,00:52:22,Was it good food or?
00:52:22,00:52:23,"It was fine, I don't know."
00:52:23,00:52:25,"Yeah, no, you didn't care."
00:52:25,00:52:27,"No, I just, I love a good joke."
00:52:27,00:52:29,"Or a bad joke, just a joke, I love a joke."
00:52:29,00:52:30,Anyone having an effort?
00:52:30,00:52:33,I looked at the rules of naming companies in the UK.
00:52:33,00:52:38,"So if you have a limited company, your name has to end in limited."
00:52:38,00:52:41,Or it's also allowed to end in SIF.
00:52:41,00:52:42,SIF.
00:52:42,00:52:43,S-I-T-H.
00:52:43,00:52:45,C-Y-F.
00:52:45,00:52:46,Can we guess why?
00:52:46,00:52:48,Riddle of me this.
00:52:48,00:52:50,Is it guessable or is this what it is?
00:52:50,00:52:53,I think that question was directed at Lydia.
00:52:53,00:52:55,I think you and I said this one out.
00:52:55,00:52:58,"I'll tell you what, there is a clue if you've been on Only Connect"
00:52:58,00:53:01,because it's related to something to do with Only Connect.
00:53:01,00:53:02,Corrin.
00:53:02,00:53:04,"Ah, no, where do they film Only Connect?"
00:53:04,00:53:05,"Oh, Cardiff."
00:53:05,00:53:06,Which is in?
00:53:06,00:53:07,Wales.
00:53:07,00:53:08,Which.
00:53:08,00:53:09,"Oh, it's Welsh."
00:53:09,00:53:11,"Well, they speak."
00:53:11,00:53:14,"Yeah, it's Welsh, so it's SIFingadig,"
00:53:14,00:53:17,"which means limited, is shortened to SIF."
00:53:17,00:53:21,"SIFingadig, sounds like a song, sounds like a Mary J. Blyche song."
00:53:21,00:53:25,SIFingadig.
00:53:25,00:53:28,Who did that song where they say it backwards?
00:53:28,00:53:29,Did they?
00:53:29,00:53:30,"Oh, Missy Elliott."
00:53:30,00:53:32,"Missy Elliott, is that who you think that?"
00:53:32,00:53:34,That's something he obviously...
00:53:34,00:53:35,Same kind of era.
00:53:35,00:53:36,Same kind of era.
00:53:36,00:53:37,That's true.
00:53:37,00:53:39,I'm going to get myself a point.
00:53:39,00:53:40,"Okay, one point for me."
00:53:40,00:53:42,Is this Only Connect's work?
00:53:42,00:53:45,We haven't been on.
00:53:45,00:53:47,There are words where you need permission
00:53:47,00:53:50,"to add them to your company name, a big long list of them."
00:53:50,00:53:54,"So, you are not allowed to have the word benevolent"
00:53:54,00:53:58,in your company name because it implies you're a charity
00:53:58,00:54:00,or that you're helping families or whatever.
00:54:00,00:54:01,Okay.
00:54:01,00:54:03,What if you're a charity and you're helping families?
00:54:03,00:54:04,You need permission still.
00:54:04,00:54:05,"Well, you need permission, so..."
00:54:05,00:54:06,"Yeah, you are allowed to."
00:54:06,00:54:08,It's possible that you're allowed them.
00:54:08,00:54:11,"The word Doug, you're not allowed."
00:54:11,00:54:13,"D-U-G, can you guess why?"
00:54:13,00:54:14,Is it Welsh?
00:54:14,00:54:15,Is it?
00:54:15,00:54:16,Is it?
00:54:16,00:54:18,"It is Welsh, yeah."
00:54:18,00:54:21,"I thought, hey, Dougie, you had somehow got the domain"
00:54:21,00:54:23,of every single possibility.
00:54:23,00:54:24,Why not?
00:54:24,00:54:26,It's Welsh for Duke.
00:54:26,00:54:29,"And so, you're not allowed to be called King or Queen"
00:54:29,00:54:31,or Duke or whatever without permission
00:54:31,00:54:33,because they might think that it's a royal company.
00:54:33,00:54:35,"What if your surname is King, Queen?"
00:54:35,00:54:37,"Yeah, you would just have to say,"
00:54:37,00:54:38,is it okay that I do this?
00:54:38,00:54:39,"And they would say yes, I think."
00:54:39,00:54:41,"So, is it the Grand Old Doug of York?"
00:54:41,00:54:42,As a song.
00:54:42,00:54:44,"No, because York is not in Wales."
00:54:44,00:54:47,"No, no, the song, just the Grand Old Doug of Cardiff."
00:54:47,00:54:48,"Okay, right."
00:54:48,00:54:52,"And also, there are two cities."
00:54:52,00:54:54,"These are both in England,"
00:54:54,00:54:56,which are not allowed to use without permission.
00:54:56,00:54:57,Okay.
00:54:57,00:54:58,I bet it's going to...
00:54:58,00:54:59,Both.
00:54:59,00:55:00,Cheddar.
00:55:00,00:55:01,Windsor?
00:55:01,00:55:02,Windsor?
00:55:02,00:55:03,Oh!
00:55:03,00:55:05,"Luthier has got one of them, Windsor."
00:55:05,00:55:08,"And the other one is very, very difficult to guess."
00:55:08,00:55:09,Is it a pun?
00:55:09,00:55:10,Is it something that means something else?
00:55:10,00:55:11,"No, it's not."
00:55:11,00:55:14,It's just because this city is very famous
00:55:14,00:55:15,for making other things.
00:55:15,00:55:16,Sheffield?
00:55:16,00:55:18,"Manchester, sorry."
00:55:18,00:55:19,Sorry.
00:55:19,00:55:21,"Sorry, I got it right again."
00:55:21,00:55:22,Wow.
00:55:22,00:55:27,"Yeah, so the company of Cutlers is allowed to object to anyone calling their company Sheffield."
00:55:27,00:55:31,"FYI, International Relations, Sheffield's incredibly famous for making cutlery."
00:55:31,00:55:32,Yeah.
00:55:32,00:55:35,"They do have to reject company names every year, don't they?"
00:55:35,00:55:38,"Because obviously, a lot of people apply with these things in their titles,"
00:55:38,00:55:41,"and often they get told they can't use that name,"
00:55:41,00:55:44,and often it is people who are like Queen's plumbing or whatever.
00:55:44,00:55:47,"But also, the company's house,"
00:55:47,00:55:50,"which is sort of the British register of companies,"
00:55:50,00:55:52,"and they say if you're allowed to set up a business,"
00:55:52,00:55:54,"they don't allow offensive names,"
00:55:54,00:55:57,and so I was just looking at some of the names that have been rejected recently.
00:55:57,00:55:58,Hey.
00:55:58,00:55:59,Should we do some rejected names?
00:55:59,00:56:00,"Yes, please."
00:56:00,00:56:01,There are a lot.
00:56:01,00:56:06,"There are almost 57,000 names rejected between January 2019 and April 2022."
00:56:06,00:56:07,Wow.
00:56:07,00:56:08,So they've gone through a lot.
00:56:08,00:56:09,Wow.
00:56:09,00:56:11,"Lawnporn, UK."
00:56:11,00:56:14,Is that a gardening place or a pornography place?
00:56:14,00:56:16,"I think it does both, yeah."
00:56:16,00:56:19,"The husband does the gardening, and then the wife does the porn."
00:56:19,00:56:20,Lawnporn.
00:56:20,00:56:23,I think probably just lawn-knowing.
00:56:23,00:56:25,"Doggy style, which..."
00:56:25,00:56:26,Yeah.
00:56:26,00:56:27,That's good.
00:56:27,00:56:28,Is that like dog hairdressers?
00:56:28,00:56:31,"Well, the sad thing about the fact they were rejected as company names is"
00:56:31,00:56:34,"you can't actually look up the company and find out what it does,"
00:56:34,00:56:38,but I've got to assume it's an anal sex selling company.
00:56:38,00:56:39,Yeah.
00:56:39,00:56:40,Come with us.
00:56:40,00:56:42,We're all your anal sex selling.

00:56:53,00:56:58,I'm bull parking in the rear.
00:56:58,00:57:01,And bum face and dick weasel.
00:57:01,00:57:04,"Can I just say, me and Dan were very upset."
00:57:04,00:57:08,They wouldn't let us use our perfectly normal nicknames.
00:57:08,00:57:11,"That's our fringe show this year, isn't it?"
00:57:11,00:57:19,Double act.
00:57:19,00:57:20,"Okay, that's it."
