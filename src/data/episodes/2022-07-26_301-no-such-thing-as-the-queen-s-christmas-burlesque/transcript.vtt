WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.400
 How's he been? Who James?

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:07.560
 Father Christmas.

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:08.800
 Has he been where?

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:11.800
 To your house to give you presents, because it's Christmas Day!

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:13.040
 It is Christmas Day!

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:14.040
 Yes!

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:19.800
 He has, he went down the chimney of my laptop to deliver me a new episode of No Such Thing As A Fish.

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:20.800
 Amazing.

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:21.800
 Yes!

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:26.800
 What we have got for you today a little bit earlier than scheduled is our Christmas special recorded

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:30.880
 live in the most Christmasy of places Birmingham!

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:32.680
 Oh, it was so Christmassy.

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:33.920
 It was so Christmassy.

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:37.520
 There was stuff outside, there were lights, there were German sausages.

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:38.760
 So many German sausages.

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.560
 It was like flippy lapland.

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:41.560
 It was.

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:42.560
 It was Christmas.

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:43.560
 It was Christmas City.

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:46.280
 It was such a fun episode to do.

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:49.000
 We enjoyed ourselves, like we always do in Birmingham.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.480
 It's one of the best places that we go and visit, really, really hope you enjoy it.

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:56.200
 It's full of Christmassy facts that you can tell all of your family over the Christmas

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:57.200
 table.

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:58.440
 Over the Christmas table?

00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:59.440
 Over it.

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:00.440
 Over the Christmas table.

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:03.520
 Get over that table and tell them our facts.

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:06.640
 Well, hey, this has been successful.

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:08.240
 Enjoy your day.

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:09.240
 That's the main thing.

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.760
 Yeah, the main thing is that you have a really good day.

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:12.760
 Enjoy your Christmas.

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:17.480
 Hope you got lots of amazing presents, and here is an extra rarely episode of No Such Thing

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:18.480
 As A Fish.

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:19.480
 Oh, ho, ho, ho.

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:20.480
 Such Thing As A Fish.

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:21.480
 Sure.

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:28.480
 Okay, on with the podcast.

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:31.760
 On with the son of God, cast not like.

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:36.760
 On with the son of God, cast not like.

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:59.280
 Hello, and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing As A Fish, a weekly podcast this

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:04.040
 week coming to you live from Birmingham!

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:13.160
 My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here with Anna Chazinski, Andrew Hunter Murray and

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:17.800
 James Harkin, and once again, we have gathered around the microphones this time with our four

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:25.680
 favorite Christmas facts from the last seven days, and in no particular order, here we go.

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:32.840
 Starting with you, Andy, my fact is that in 1958, the Queen's speech was lost on the

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:38.440
 day of delivery, and then found by a nearby poodle.

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:41.200
 It's a heartwarming Christmas story for the ages.

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.700
 Oh, though what it says to me is that the cogs are really shit at fundamentally.

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.720
 Yeah, that's true.

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:52.280
 This was in 1958, so obviously she hadn't been done many of these speeches before, pretty

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:56.280
 nerve-wracking, still live delivery, and one of the most important copies of the speech,

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:01.160
 one with all the producers' notes on it, was lost, and then found by a poodle.

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:03.720
 So what was the poodle doing there?

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:06.080
 I thought security was quite tight around the Queen.

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:10.120
 I think it was not by the Queen, so if it, I mean she would have found it, if it would have

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:11.120
 been next to her.

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:13.800
 But surely, it must have been near the Queen.

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:15.880
 I think it was at a nearby train station, was it?

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:16.880
 What?

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:19.200
 So this poodle has no involvement in the story.

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.360
 Well, no, he's the main protagonist in the story.

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:23.000
 I don't know if you heard the story.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.800
 Sorry, no, so what I mean is it's not like the poodle was in Buckingham Palace going

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:32.400
 to have lost script, I'm on it. No, no, no, no, no, they didn't summon it in to find the script.

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:33.400
 And did they?

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:38.000
 No, no, no, they didn't summon it in to find, Jesus.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:43.440
 You don't say I've lost a script somewhere in the United Kingdom, I need one poodle.

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:47.880
 The poodle at a train station noticed a bag, there was a bag, and the poodle went over

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:48.880
 and explored it.

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:50.920
 I can't remember the name of the poodle, I don't think I wrote it down.

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:53.160
 How did he know it was the Queen's speech?

00:03:53.160 --> 00:04:02.600
 Well, he did a sort of series of mimes to his master.

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:05.400
 The owner of the poodle was a guy called John Harvey, who then took it to the police.

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:09.320
 The Queen's speech was saved, and things just carried on.

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:10.320
 That's normal.

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:11.320
 Right.

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:14.320
 Thank God, because where would we have been without that speech?

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:15.320
 Right, right.

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:18.520
 Everyone remembers the 1958, right?

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:23.440
 I remember the 1959 speech, and when I say I remember, I'm not that old, but I can tell

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:28.320
 you about the 1959 speech, because it was the first speech that had a joke in it, as far

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:33.200
 as I can see, because I read through the early ones, and this one, the Queen said, she explained

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:37.000
 all the places they were going, all these new countries in the Commonwealth, and she

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.400
 said, "So between us, we are going to many parts of the world.

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:43.640
 We have no plans for space travel at the moment."

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:48.680
 I mean, I'm not saying there was a great joke.

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:52.680
 It passes our bar for jokes, but I'm not sure it passes many people's.

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:54.960
 There was a good one in 1957.

00:04:54.960 --> 00:05:00.640
 I mean, like, classic in 1957, I would say, again, it was still live, and the Queen was doing

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:01.640
 her speech.

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:07.440
 And mid-speech, there was interference in the signal for the speech itself on TV.

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:12.800
 So while people were watching, suddenly they could hear American police officers coming

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:17.600
 over in place of the Queen speaking, and the line that was heard most by most people was,

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:20.080
 "Jo, I'm going to go grab a quick coffee."

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:25.280
 That was suddenly just in the middle of the Queen's speech in 1957.

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:28.280
 Some of them, they put them out on telly, but there was no picture.

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:33.520
 Yeah, I think between 1952 and 1957, they realised they had television now, and so they brought

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:38.560
 us on TV, but she didn't have a makeup done or something, so the first TV broadcast was

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:42.880
 in 1957, wasn't it, where you could actually see her, but before that, you could just listen

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:45.000
 to her, but watching a black TV screen.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:46.000
 Wow.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.000
 Well, we're in it.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.640
 So people might not have really known much about the Queen what she looked like and stuff

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:51.640
 like that.

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:55.880
 So when they heard someone saying, "Jo, I'm going to get a coffee," did they maybe think it

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:57.360
 was the Queen doing that?

00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:58.360
 Yeah.

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:03.280
 I think from all the money they knew what she looked like.

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:08.720
 Yeah.

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:10.120
 Okay, here's a challenge for you.

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:14.560
 Can you guys guess one thing that she never does while she is recording the speech?

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:15.560
 Perlesque.

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:17.120
 That's fair.

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:20.320
 That's technically the correct answer.

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:21.920
 It's a correct answer.

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:24.600
 I've never seen her stuffing a turkey.

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:25.600
 Yes.

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:26.600
 And you've got to re-frame the question.

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:28.520
 I think I've got for a long time.

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:30.120
 She never takes a wee.

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:31.920
 She never stands on her head.

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:36.880
 She doesn't smile in a genuine way.

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:38.600
 She does her kind of queen smile.

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:43.680
 She doesn't do this sort of big, friendly smile.

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:45.960
 She has a kind of controlled smile.

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:47.160
 She's got a queen smile.

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:48.160
 That's cool.

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:49.160
 Yeah, but there is.

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:52.360
 There was a time where the soundman decided, "Oh, she's got such a nice smile.

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:55.000
 I'm going to see if I can make a smile during a thing."

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:59.920
 So he attached a sign saying, "Smile to the camera boom arm."

00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:07.640
 And he put a sprig of holly and some tinsel next to it, and she saw it and she immediately frowned.

00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:12.000
 And he was less victim of capital punishment to this country, I'll say.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:17.400
 I discovered while reading about the Queen's Christmas Broadcast set, she is a podcast pioneer.

00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:18.400
 Is she?

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:19.400
 Yeah.

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:23.360
 The Queen's speech was released as a podcast in 2006.

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:24.360
 Wow.

00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:25.360
 Wow.

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:26.360
 We started in 2014.

00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:28.360
 Like, that's how distant it is.

00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:34.560
 And I haven't heard it, but I assume it's the same as the speech, but yeah, it's not very long.

00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:35.560
 It'd be very long.

00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:39.720
 You know, she could have done a podcast slant once Father wrote a pardo.

00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:41.720
 That's why it's not...

00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:42.720
 Queen's speech.

00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:43.720
 Stop the Queen's speech.

00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:44.720
 Hello.

00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:46.720
 We're sponsored this week.

00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:47.720
 Right.

00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:48.720
 The Royal Mint.

00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:50.720
 My all of you.

00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:51.720
 Of course, before the Queen's speech was the Queen's speech.

00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:52.720
 It was the King's speech.

00:07:52.720 --> 00:08:00.240
 All right, so it started.

00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:05.320
 I think the first one was 1932, although it only became a yearly thing in '39.

00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:10.560
 And 1932, actually, so John Rhys, who was general manager of the BBC at the time, had been

00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:14.440
 trying to persuade King George V to do a King's speech for years.

00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:15.440
 And he really didn't want to.

00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:20.200
 He was sweetly shy and nervous and thought he wasn't a very good speaker and was a technophobe,

00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:23.400
 so didn't really understand this new fangled radio thing.

00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:27.200
 And he finally was persuaded to do it when it turned out that Roger Kipling was going to

00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:29.800
 write it for him and then he thought, "Okay, well that sounds good."

00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:30.800
 He wrote it for him.

00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:32.000
 Yeah, he wrote the speech for him.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:33.000
 Jungle Book guy.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:37.280
 Yeah, Jungle Book guy as some people know him better.

00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:38.280
 What a speech.

00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:40.280
 The bare necessities.

00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:42.280
 The simple.

00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:45.480
 No, it wasn't.

00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:47.120
 He wrote some other stuff as well.

00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:48.120
 Okay, cool.

00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:49.600
 Yeah, so it was one of those other things.

00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:55.800
 Apparently, King George, from his naval days, I read, felt most comfortable in small rooms.

00:08:55.800 --> 00:09:00.360
 And so he, even though they made a fake recording studio, which was one of the grand rooms in

00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:05.840
 the palace, he actually recorded it in a box room under the stairs at Sandringham House.

00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:07.880
 And yeah, it was Harry Potter.

00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:10.160
 It was like Harry Potter, yeah.

00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:11.160
 His hand was shaking.

00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:14.200
 If you listen to it, you can hear the paper rustling because his hand was shaking so much.

00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:15.200
 Wow.

00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:16.400
 And he said it ruined his Christmas.

00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:17.400
 Oh.

00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:22.600
 Guess who produced the, can you, see, I've got another Christmas challenge for you.

00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:23.600
 Yeah.

00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:27.760
 See if you can guess who produced the messages between 1986 and 1991.

00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:29.560
 Was it Dieter Von Tees?

00:09:29.560 --> 00:09:30.560
 Oh, yeah.

00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:34.000
 I wish I hadn't got you that book about Burlesque.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:39.200
 No, it was not Dieter Von Tees.

00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:41.200
 So a BBC producer.

00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:43.200
 Yeah, but also a friend of the Queen's.

00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:44.200
 Friend of the Queen's.

00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:45.200
 Oh, Prince Charles.

00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:46.200
 David Attenborough.

00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:47.200
 David Attenborough.

00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:48.200
 Yeah.

00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:49.200
 Great fact.

00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:53.960
 It's just not his normal thing, is it, you know?

00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:57.960
 But he was, was he the guy, he was quite a famous producer before he did his other service.

00:09:57.960 --> 00:09:58.960
 He was in the '60s, yeah.

00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:03.040
 Is he the guy who, I might get this wrong, but is he the guy who decided to put Snooker

00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:05.200
 on television to sell Colour TV's?

00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:06.200
 Yes.

00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:07.200
 Yes.

00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:11.640
 It was when he was a control of BBC One, I think, when he said to sell Colour TV.

00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:15.080
 Can I say, that's just a tiny bit worse than me saying, is that the Jungle Book guy to

00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:19.560
 say David Attenborough is either Snooker guy?

00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:25.400
 Well, coming from you, the Queen, is that the woman off the money?

00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:29.080
 Oh, why do we always argue at Christmas?

00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:32.360
 Some more stuff about TV and movies around Christmas.

00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:33.360
 Oh, yeah.

00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:34.360
 Something like that.

00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:38.320
 So there were four Flintstones Christmas specials, which, how exactly, they celebrate

00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:39.320
 Christ's birth?

00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:40.320
 I don't really know.

00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:41.320
 Oh, yeah.

00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:42.320
 Oh, yeah.

00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:43.320
 They were pioneers.

00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:51.000
 And there was a, there is a YouTuber called Jake Roper, and he decided to look at that classic

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:57.280
 Christmas movie Home Alone, and he found out that he looks at all the tricks that Kevin

00:10:57.280 --> 00:11:01.680
 played on the burglars and found out what would happen in real life.

00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:05.920
 So apparently, shame on me, I haven't seen this movie, but I believe this is what happened.

00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:06.920
 Wow.

00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:07.920
 I know.

00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:12.960
 James, that's a better fact than whatever you're about to tell us.

00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:18.000
 So apparently, at one stage, he heats up a door knob, and they burn their hand.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:22.000
 And apparently, the temperatures needed to transfer enough heat to the outside knob would

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:26.480
 have melted the door or set the house on fire.

00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:30.600
 But there is a crowbar that goes to the chest of one of the burglars, but that would have

00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:33.560
 punctured his lungs and his heart.

00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:36.800
 But it wouldn't matter, because Kevin would have already murdered both of them with the

00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:43.400
 paint can trap. Apparently the force of those paint cans would have killed both of them.

00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:44.760
 That would be a very different movie.

00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:45.760
 What do you mean?

00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:46.760
 Yes.

00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:47.760
 How do you know?

00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:48.760
 You don't know.

00:11:48.760 --> 00:11:49.760
 I'm assuming.

00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:50.760
 Maybe they both die.

00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:51.760
 It is weird.

00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:54.880
 It's like watching you read a foreign language where you don't understand it.

00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:58.360
 You obviously don't quite know what, what this is in reference to at all.

00:11:58.360 --> 00:12:00.680
 Look, I read the synopsis on Wikipedia.

00:12:00.680 --> 00:12:04.040
 Do you know there's such a weird thing about Home Alone?

00:12:04.040 --> 00:12:09.400
 So Joe Pesci, who was the bad guy who's not an idiot, he obviously was more used to doing

00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:10.400
 kind of gangster films.

00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:12.000
 He's in quite a lot of serious gangster films.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.400
 And I think he might have thought this was a similar thing, so we went really method in

00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:16.400
 Home Alone.

00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:21.920
 So on the set of Home Alone, he refused to see Macauley Culkin at all, because he wanted

00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:24.040
 Macauley to be really, really terrified of him.

00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:27.320
 So you know, he didn't want to kill the magic of him being this bad guy.

00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:31.520
 And in the scene where which you may remember, and I do remember, and James doesn't remember

00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:37.040
 where he's hung up on a coat hook at one point, if you remember, by his coat.

00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:41.000
 And Joe Pesci says to him, "I'm going to bite all your fingers off one at a time."

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:46.120
 And in one of the rehearsals, he actually bit Culkin really, really hard and drew blood,

00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:47.640
 and he still has a scar.

00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:48.640
 Really?

00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:49.640
 Yeah.

00:12:49.640 --> 00:12:53.000
 Apparently, this little nine-year-old boy had to do a screaming fit and be like, "I don't

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:56.800
 care how many Oscars you've got, don't go around biting nine-year-olds."

00:12:56.800 --> 00:12:57.800
 Ah.

00:12:57.800 --> 00:13:03.000
 That's apparently an ET when they were filming it, Steven Spielberg needed Drew Barrymore

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:06.520
 to cry during a scene, there's a scene where she really solbs.

00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:10.560
 And behind the scenes of it is that apparently before the take was done, Steven Spielberg leaned

00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:13.600
 into her going, "It's going to be a good scene.

00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:14.600
 You know, you'll be great.

00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:15.600
 You'll be great."

00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:17.080
 By the way, your dog just died.

00:13:17.080 --> 00:13:21.040
 And then walked back, and she burst out crying, and that's her genuinely crying.

00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:22.040
 Wow.

00:13:22.040 --> 00:13:24.880
 Anyway, Merry Christmas.

00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:30.200
 We need to move on to our next fact.

00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:33.840
 Time for fact number two, and that is Chazinski.

00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:39.160
 My fact this week is that as well as being the birthplace of Jesus, Bethlehem is also where

00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:43.160
 we found the oldest known depiction of people having sex.

00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:44.160
 Yeah.

00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:52.440
 Of which is very, that's very ironic, because famously, that was a sex-free zone.

00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:53.440
 Oh, yeah.

00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:54.440
 Yeah.

00:13:54.440 --> 00:14:00.640
 As a sex-free zone, it was just they had two people of many people had sex, right?

00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:01.640
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:14:01.640 --> 00:14:03.200
 But it is related to non-sex.

00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:07.720
 They, Mary and Joseph, didn't have access to this piece of art, otherwise they would have

00:14:07.720 --> 00:14:08.720
 known what to do.

00:14:08.720 --> 00:14:10.720
 But they didn't have instructions.

00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:11.720
 Yeah.

00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:13.800
 So, yeah, I think this is such a weird coincidence.

00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:16.280
 This is a really quite a beautiful piece of art.

00:14:16.280 --> 00:14:17.280
 It's made of calcite.

00:14:17.280 --> 00:14:22.280
 It's from 11,000 years ago, so it's a stone-aged piece of art, and it's kind of this couple

00:14:22.280 --> 00:14:27.240
 of Androgenous humans sort of, I don't know how sex works when they're that Androgenous,

00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:32.680
 but sort of intertwined, like legs over each other, look it up, it's very nice.

00:14:32.680 --> 00:14:43.080
 Face to face, so the traditional way, and it, sure, sure, you could specify, but not missionary

00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:44.080
 I would say.

00:14:44.080 --> 00:14:48.520
 Well, when you look at it, it's quite hard to tell if it was meant to be upright or horizontal.

00:14:48.520 --> 00:14:53.200
 So that's sort of in the eye of the beholder.

00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:54.200
 Anyway.

00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:58.040
 I'm really looking forward to your BBC 4 documentary on the history of art.

00:14:58.040 --> 00:15:03.360
 So this, it is, when I first looked at it, I thought it just looked like a rock.

00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:04.360
 Okay.

00:15:04.360 --> 00:15:07.040
 Maybe I'm just not into my art, as much as other is.

00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:08.040
 It doesn't look like a rock.

00:15:08.040 --> 00:15:10.920
 It looks like two people gloriously intertwined.

00:15:10.920 --> 00:15:11.920
 Sure.

00:15:11.920 --> 00:15:12.920
 Okay.

00:15:12.920 --> 00:15:16.680
 But according to artist Mark Quinn, depending on the perspective and how you look at it,

00:15:16.680 --> 00:15:23.040
 it also resembles a penis, breasts, or a vagina, depending on which way you kind of move

00:15:23.040 --> 00:15:24.040
 it around.

00:15:24.040 --> 00:15:25.520
 So it's like a bit of trick art.

00:15:25.520 --> 00:15:26.520
 Oh, cool.

00:15:26.520 --> 00:15:30.720
 It is, it is very cool that that, because if you put it, if you put it sort of sideways onto

00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:34.360
 you, so it says widest, it looks like the couple, one next to each other, and then if you move

00:15:34.360 --> 00:15:37.960
 it so it's sort of end on, it looks like a penis.

00:15:37.960 --> 00:15:39.840
 And then on the base, there's a cheeky vagina.

00:15:39.840 --> 00:15:42.520
 So it's a very, it is amazing.

00:15:42.520 --> 00:15:43.520
 A cheeky vagina.

00:15:43.520 --> 00:15:45.120
 It's a dream for the price of one, isn't it?

00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:46.120
 Yeah, it is.

00:15:46.120 --> 00:15:51.560
 So basically your pawn hub of 10,000 years ago, because you could just search for any of

00:15:51.560 --> 00:15:54.240
 three things, and then you would get it.

00:15:54.240 --> 00:16:00.120
 Anyway, so it was found in the 1930s by some Bedouin Shepherd boys, and obviously it's now

00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:02.040
 in the British Museum.

00:16:02.040 --> 00:16:06.520
 It's quite nice that it was Shepherd.

00:16:06.520 --> 00:16:07.520
 That's cool.

00:16:07.520 --> 00:16:08.520
 Isn't it?

00:16:08.520 --> 00:16:09.520
 Just watching the flock.

00:16:09.520 --> 00:16:10.520
 Right.

00:16:10.520 --> 00:16:11.520
 Yeah.

00:16:11.520 --> 00:16:16.640
 The Deppers looked at their horny rock by night.

00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:17.880
 Is that a star in this guy?

00:16:17.880 --> 00:16:18.880
 Doesn't matter.

00:16:18.880 --> 00:16:21.560
 Keep looking at the rock.

00:16:21.560 --> 00:16:22.560
 We have no evidence.

00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:25.280
 They got any kind of arousal out of it.

00:16:25.280 --> 00:16:27.360
 They just, they found it, and then they gave it to an archaeologist.

00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:31.800
 It's in an area just sort of within a few miles of Bethem, called Ain Sacri, and it's in

00:16:31.800 --> 00:16:33.280
 a cave.

00:16:33.280 --> 00:16:39.200
 And yeah, made by the Natufians, who were, they're called a sedentary people, which isn't as

00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:40.640
 insulting as it sounds.

00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:45.240
 It just means that they were not nomadic, very unusually for that time.

00:16:45.240 --> 00:16:46.240
 They weren't nomadic.

00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:49.240
 I think they're my favourite group of people from history than the Deppers.

00:16:49.240 --> 00:16:50.240
 Really?

00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:54.400
 Yeah, because the first example we have of anyone who domesticated the dog, they're the

00:16:54.400 --> 00:16:56.840
 first examples we have of a big feast.

00:16:56.840 --> 00:16:59.640
 They were the first example we have of beer.

00:16:59.640 --> 00:17:02.880
 It might be just people are looking in that place and so on and so on.

00:17:02.880 --> 00:17:06.600
 But I think they sound like a really cool bunch of people.

00:17:06.600 --> 00:17:14.520
 The first known beer, I think, is 13,000 years BP, which is not a petrol reference.

00:17:14.520 --> 00:17:17.960
 But so I didn't know about this phrase, but it sounds for before present.

00:17:17.960 --> 00:17:21.120
 And I don't know why we need it when we have BC.

00:17:21.120 --> 00:17:25.880
 But so it's 13,000 years BP, so I guess about 11,000 years BC.

00:17:25.880 --> 00:17:30.000
 And when do you think before present, it sort of starts from, as in this?

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.160
 Well, just when you said it a few seconds ago.

00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:33.160
 But not anymore.

00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:34.760
 Now it's now.

00:17:34.760 --> 00:17:35.760
 And so forth.

00:17:35.760 --> 00:17:36.760
 Is it not that?

00:17:36.760 --> 00:17:39.200
 I'm going to have to say your first answer.

00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:40.200
 And it's not.

00:17:40.200 --> 00:17:41.200
 It's 1950.

00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:43.200
 OK, boomer.

00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:51.240
 It's not when archaeologists just decided the present is 1950.

00:17:51.240 --> 00:17:52.240
 That is so strange.

00:17:52.240 --> 00:17:53.240
 It's really weird.

00:17:53.240 --> 00:17:57.440
 It's because some people think it's like where there was atomic bombs.

00:17:57.440 --> 00:17:58.440
 It's exactly that.

00:17:58.440 --> 00:17:59.440
 It's that because of it.

00:17:59.440 --> 00:18:03.440
 And so then any rocks from then on have some kind of radioactivity, so you can't use carbon

00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:04.440
 dating as well.

00:18:04.440 --> 00:18:09.440
 Everything's kind of screwed up after 1950 because of all the nuclear shit, as you say.

00:18:09.440 --> 00:18:12.400
 There's a theory that it's the other Bethlehem.

00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:18.280
 But it's the Bethlehem that we have where there is a church and a cave and all the tourism

00:18:18.280 --> 00:18:19.280
 and religion.

00:18:19.280 --> 00:18:20.280
 Why do you know the Bethlehem?

00:18:20.280 --> 00:18:21.280
 There's one in Wales, for instance.

00:18:21.280 --> 00:18:22.280
 It's not that one.

00:18:22.280 --> 00:18:23.280
 I know there's one in Pennsylvania.

00:18:23.280 --> 00:18:24.280
 It's not that one.

00:18:24.280 --> 00:18:26.040
 There's one in the Galilee.

00:18:26.040 --> 00:18:29.840
 And an Israeli archaeologist has said that although there probably won't be any proof

00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:34.280
 due to modern building work, a lot of Jesus' life happened near the other

00:18:34.280 --> 00:18:39.960
 Galilee or near the Galilee, and also that one is only a few hours of a walk from Nazareth,

00:18:39.960 --> 00:18:43.680
 which is where Mary and Joseph traditionally came from.

00:18:43.680 --> 00:18:47.400
 So it's more reasonable that a pregnant, heavily pregnant woman would have walked for a few

00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:48.400
 hours.

00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:52.560
 But did they say that they spent like weeks in the desert walking from one place to the

00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:53.560
 other?

00:18:53.560 --> 00:18:55.560
 They must have got really lost if it's this one right now.

00:18:55.560 --> 00:18:56.560
 That's true.

00:18:56.560 --> 00:18:57.560
 That's the thing they did, though.

00:18:57.560 --> 00:18:58.560
 That's the weird thing.

00:18:58.560 --> 00:19:04.240
 So the Nativity, the birth of Jesus is only mentioned in two of the Gospels anyway, Luke and Matthew,

00:19:04.240 --> 00:19:06.280
 and it's only in Luke that they make the journey.

00:19:06.280 --> 00:19:08.480
 So Matthew, they're already living in Bethlehem.

00:19:08.480 --> 00:19:12.360
 And even in Matthew, this is the extent of the whole journey that we have, the impression

00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:14.040
 of the donkey and the long trip.

00:19:14.040 --> 00:19:18.800
 He just says, "You know it was for a census, so they both confirmed that they were going

00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:21.840
 to Bethlehem for a census and they sort of happened to have a child while they were

00:19:21.840 --> 00:19:22.840
 there.

00:19:22.840 --> 00:19:26.360
 But when Joseph went to be registered with Mary, he was expecting a child.

00:19:26.360 --> 00:19:29.720
 While they were there, she gave birth and wrapped him in bounds of cloth and laid him in a

00:19:29.720 --> 00:19:32.240
 manger because there was no place for him in the inn."

00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:33.240
 And that's it.

00:19:33.240 --> 00:19:34.240
 That's all we have.

00:19:34.240 --> 00:19:37.960
 And all the other stuff is from later the donkey, the long journey, the cave, it all comes

00:19:37.960 --> 00:19:39.960
 from the proto-gospel of James.

00:19:39.960 --> 00:19:42.080
 Wait, you didn't say the cave, did you?

00:19:42.080 --> 00:19:43.080
 The cave.

00:19:43.080 --> 00:19:44.080
 Oh, the cave, sorry.

00:19:44.080 --> 00:19:45.080
 Yeah.

00:19:45.080 --> 00:19:48.320
 They cracked open a cave and had a whale of a time.

00:19:48.320 --> 00:19:53.480
 Traditional English Christmases used to have a mint pie in the shape of a manger and

00:19:53.480 --> 00:20:01.360
 you would put a little Christ child doll in the pie, based on the pie, on the pie, which

00:20:01.360 --> 00:20:04.480
 was sort of shaped like a manger, like kind of trough.

00:20:04.480 --> 00:20:07.360
 And then you would put the Christ child in it and then at dinner time you would eat the

00:20:07.360 --> 00:20:08.360
 pie.

00:20:08.360 --> 00:20:09.560
 So sorry, did you eat the Jesus?

00:20:09.560 --> 00:20:10.560
 No, you didn't eat the Jesus.

00:20:10.560 --> 00:20:13.800
 The Jesus, I think, was an annual decoration to be done every year.

00:20:13.800 --> 00:20:14.800
 Yes.

00:20:14.800 --> 00:20:16.800
 The pie was just, the pie was the edible bit.

00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:17.800
 See.

00:20:17.800 --> 00:20:18.800
 She's complaining to the waiter.

00:20:18.800 --> 00:20:22.960
 Wait a waiter, there's a Jesus in my pie.

00:20:22.960 --> 00:20:25.240
 What comes next?

00:20:25.240 --> 00:20:26.240
 Is there an ending to that joke?

00:20:26.240 --> 00:20:27.240
 Are you joking?

00:20:27.240 --> 00:20:28.240
 With the fly.

00:20:28.240 --> 00:20:29.240
 Yeah, you are.

00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:30.240
 No, no.

00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:31.240
 What's the end to the fly joke?

00:20:31.240 --> 00:20:32.240
 Oh, my God.

00:20:32.240 --> 00:20:33.240
 Should we sit together?

00:20:33.240 --> 00:20:35.040
 There's a fly in my soup.

00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:36.040
 Don't you?

00:20:36.040 --> 00:20:37.040
 Don't you?

00:20:37.040 --> 00:20:38.040
 Don't you?

00:20:38.040 --> 00:20:39.040
 Don't you?

00:20:39.040 --> 00:20:40.040
 Don't you?

00:20:40.040 --> 00:20:41.040
 Don't you?

00:20:41.040 --> 00:20:42.040
 Everyone will want one.

00:20:42.040 --> 00:20:43.040
 That's dated.

00:20:43.040 --> 00:20:46.840
 It's the way we told it.

00:20:46.840 --> 00:20:49.840
 Do you guys know where the animals come from and the nativity?

00:20:49.840 --> 00:20:53.560
 You know where you usually have an ox and a kind of a duck in it, so they're not mentioned

00:20:53.560 --> 00:20:54.560
 in the Bible either.

00:20:54.560 --> 00:21:00.840
 They're not mentioned in the Bible, but they come from the gospel of pseudo Matthew, who

00:21:00.840 --> 00:21:04.600
 appeared in the eighth century and claimed he should have remembered all this stuff.

00:21:04.600 --> 00:21:08.760
 No, so pseudo Matthew wrote the gospel, which is where we get a lot of onitivity ideas.

00:21:08.760 --> 00:21:14.040
 And he introduced the stable where Jesus was born and adds an ox and an ass, but he also

00:21:14.040 --> 00:21:18.160
 added to the scene lions, leopards and dragons.

00:21:18.160 --> 00:21:19.160
 No.

00:21:19.160 --> 00:21:20.160
 That's so cool.

00:21:20.160 --> 00:21:21.160
 Yeah, that's correct.

00:21:21.160 --> 00:21:25.040
 If you want to do the nativity properly, if you're having an ox, you might as well have a lion,

00:21:25.040 --> 00:21:26.040
 a leopard and a dragon.

00:21:26.040 --> 00:21:29.280
 He said they were all wagging their tails to show their devotion.

00:21:29.280 --> 00:21:33.400
 Have we spoken about nativity thefts?

00:21:33.400 --> 00:21:35.400
 I can't remember if we've ever talked about it before.

00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:37.400
 Are people stealing nativity scenes?

00:21:37.400 --> 00:21:38.400
 Yeah, it is.

00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:43.200
 And so there's been a huge rash of this in lots of places in the last few years, so there

00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:50.820
 is another Bethlehem in Pennsylvania, and there a woman stole the crib in 2016 and broke

00:21:50.820 --> 00:21:51.820
 a bit.

00:21:51.820 --> 00:21:54.200
 The chief of police had to glue baby Jesus' leg back on.

00:21:54.200 --> 00:21:56.200
 It was very embarrassing.

00:21:56.200 --> 00:22:01.080
 So they had to put a security camera solely on the baby Jesus when they reinstalled it.

00:22:01.080 --> 00:22:02.560
 But this keeps happening.

00:22:02.560 --> 00:22:08.840
 So there's a place in Wisconsin called West Bend where 2017 Jesus was stolen, then they

00:22:08.840 --> 00:22:09.840
 found it.

00:22:09.840 --> 00:22:10.840
 They replaced the Jesus.

00:22:10.840 --> 00:22:14.520
 And Chris was Eve, it was stolen again, the baby Jesus.

00:22:14.520 --> 00:22:18.880
 And there was a police officer who saw a woman suspiciously cradling something.

00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:22.240
 I don't know how you do that.

00:22:22.240 --> 00:22:24.240
 And it was the replacement baby Jesus, they put back in.

00:22:24.240 --> 00:22:25.840
 And the officer yelled, "Belie, stop."

00:22:25.840 --> 00:22:28.040
 And she dropped the Jesus and pegged it.

00:22:28.040 --> 00:22:32.760
 So now in West Bend, everything is bolted, literally everything is bolted down.

00:22:32.760 --> 00:22:36.720
 The baby Jesus is plastered to the manger.

00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:40.480
 And there is a camera which has hunting technology where when someone leans in for a

00:22:40.480 --> 00:22:46.800
 closer look, a motion-activated trail camera kicks in and starts recording their every move.

00:22:46.800 --> 00:22:49.500
 We need to move on in a sec to our next fact.

00:22:49.500 --> 00:22:51.600
 We could talk about some erotic art.

00:22:51.600 --> 00:22:52.600
 Oh, okay, yeah.

00:22:52.600 --> 00:22:53.600
 Oh, sure.

00:22:53.600 --> 00:22:59.200
 Well, I just wanted to quickly mention another very old piece of art, which is all the statues

00:22:59.200 --> 00:23:03.440
 of this Egyptian god called Min, who I didn't know existed, but he was a god of fertility.

00:23:03.440 --> 00:23:08.360
 And you see little sculptures of him from around the fourth millennium BC.

00:23:08.360 --> 00:23:13.720
 So bloody long time ago, and he has a very close association with lettuce, and that is because

00:23:13.720 --> 00:23:19.200
 so he's, oh, if you look at him, he's always seen standing with a very erect, very long penis,

00:23:19.200 --> 00:23:22.240
 which he's cradling in his left hand, I think.

00:23:22.240 --> 00:23:24.400
 And then he's associated with lettuce, which was…

00:23:24.400 --> 00:23:25.720
 Suspiciously cradling.

00:23:25.720 --> 00:23:30.440
 That's how you always suspiciously cradle something.

00:23:30.440 --> 00:23:32.440
 If it's a penis, it is always suspicious.

00:23:32.440 --> 00:23:35.000
 I don't know how she was cradling the baby Jesus though, is it?

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:36.000
 No, no, it was not.

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:37.000
 I'm sure.

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:41.300
 But, yeah, he was the god of fertility and associated with lettuce, and it was thought the lettuce

00:23:41.300 --> 00:23:45.480
 was the most aphrodisiacal food stuff, because it looks like a penis.

00:23:45.480 --> 00:23:50.000
 But also, if you break a leaf off a lettuce, it oozes kind of white substance, and so this

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:51.000
 was really revered.

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:54.680
 Sorry, I must say that these are old lettuces that you would get in ancient Egypt.

00:23:54.680 --> 00:24:00.280
 If you go to St. Brees and get an iceberg, what it doesn't look like a penis, and to it

00:24:00.280 --> 00:24:01.760
 doesn't ooze white liquid.

00:24:01.760 --> 00:24:02.760
 It looks a tiny bit.

00:24:02.760 --> 00:24:07.440
 Is that remain long, romaine, long phallic thing, but yeah, it looks less like a penis and

00:24:07.440 --> 00:24:08.440
 doesn't do the oozing?

00:24:08.440 --> 00:24:11.720
 Waiter, waiter, there's a penis in my lettuce.

00:24:11.720 --> 00:24:15.120
 That one actually doesn't have an ending.

00:24:15.120 --> 00:24:17.920
 Sorry, can I say one last thing about nativity?

00:24:17.920 --> 00:24:18.920
 Sorry.

00:24:18.920 --> 00:24:20.560
 It's just there was a nativity set available on Amazon.

00:24:20.560 --> 00:24:25.360
 I've read a lot of reviews of nativity sets that you can buy for yourself, and there is

00:24:25.360 --> 00:24:32.720
 one set that is available on Amazon for £3.69, so this is a very, you know, cost.

00:24:32.720 --> 00:24:33.720
 Reasonably priced.

00:24:33.720 --> 00:24:37.960
 Reasonably priced, nativity set, and the main review for it says this, bearing in mind

00:24:37.960 --> 00:24:42.640
 the price, I did not expect a work of art, but I did hope for something tasteful.

00:24:42.640 --> 00:24:45.000
 The three figurines were tatty and badly painted.

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:49.000
 Joseph had white paint splattered all over his cloak and down his staff.

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:51.040
 The bit, the bit, no, stop.

00:24:51.040 --> 00:24:55.080
 Are you sure that wasn't lettuce juice?

00:24:55.080 --> 00:24:59.560
 It gets, like this nativity gets worse, the beard on the right side of his face was higher

00:24:59.560 --> 00:25:03.120
 than the left and covered his whole nose.

00:25:03.120 --> 00:25:05.120
 Mary's paintwork was even tattier.

00:25:05.120 --> 00:25:08.120
 She has two left hands.

00:25:08.120 --> 00:25:13.360
 Baby Jesus has a right eye that is twice the size of his left eye and his mouth is on the

00:25:13.360 --> 00:25:16.360
 right side of his face.

00:25:16.360 --> 00:25:17.360
 So it is an optimist thing.

00:25:17.360 --> 00:25:20.520
 And there was no dragon.

00:25:20.520 --> 00:25:24.360
 Oh, we need to move on to our next fact.

00:25:24.360 --> 00:25:28.640
 Okay, it is time for fact number three, and that is my fact.

00:25:28.640 --> 00:25:33.600
 My fact this week is the most likely time in the year to have a heart attack is during

00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:37.400
 a family Christmas gathering.

00:25:37.400 --> 00:25:38.760
 This is absolutely true.

00:25:38.760 --> 00:25:40.760
 This was research that was done in Sweden.

00:25:40.760 --> 00:25:43.680
 They looked at data of 283,000 heart attacks.

00:25:43.680 --> 00:25:49.920
 It took place in the country between 1998 and 2013, and they found that at 10pm on December

00:25:49.920 --> 00:25:55.200
 the 24th, which is when the Swedes celebrate, that is when the Christmas gatherings happen,

00:25:55.200 --> 00:26:00.040
 that is when it was most likely to happen, 37% more likely to happen on Christmas Eve,

00:26:00.040 --> 00:26:04.720
 then say 20% on New Year's Day or any other period of the year.

00:26:04.720 --> 00:26:05.720
 That is really good.

00:26:05.720 --> 00:26:13.800
 They got this information from a database they have of 283,000 heart attacks, and the database

00:26:13.800 --> 00:26:15.920
 is called "sweet heart."

00:26:15.920 --> 00:26:18.920
 That is sweet.

00:26:18.920 --> 00:26:22.520
 It is something that ruins lives.

00:26:22.520 --> 00:26:25.400
 Do we know what they think it is due to, is it due to Christmas arguments?

00:26:25.400 --> 00:26:29.000
 It is due to arguments, stress, did I get the right present?

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:35.240
 I have all the family here, we have uncles and aunties and children who do not usually hang

00:26:35.240 --> 00:26:37.480
 in one room necessarily or when they do.

00:26:37.480 --> 00:26:41.160
 You say it is due to, obviously we do not know why it is, but we are speculating that

00:26:41.160 --> 00:26:42.160
 it is because of that.

00:26:42.160 --> 00:26:44.280
 It was not like they interviewed everyone mid heart attack and said, "What is it that you

00:26:44.280 --> 00:26:45.280
 think is caused this?"

00:26:45.280 --> 00:26:48.000
 And they said, "Well, my wife is being a real bitch in the kitchen."

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:49.000
 Yeah, yeah.

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:53.480
 People thought it was the cold quite a lot, but then they did a similar study in the Southern

00:26:53.480 --> 00:26:56.680
 hemisphere and found quite similar results, I think, didn't they?

00:26:56.680 --> 00:26:57.680
 Yeah.

00:26:57.680 --> 00:27:00.200
 I think it is monopoly.

00:27:00.200 --> 00:27:01.840
 Have you seen this about monopoly this year?

00:27:01.840 --> 00:27:04.680
 They have released the longest ever game of monopoly.

00:27:04.680 --> 00:27:05.680
 Really?

00:27:05.680 --> 00:27:06.680
 Yeah.

00:27:06.680 --> 00:27:07.680
 Because they are always doing new additions.

00:27:07.680 --> 00:27:14.320
 Yeah, so the newest addition, they have 66 properties that you can get instead of 28.

00:27:14.320 --> 00:27:18.640
 There are 40 extra spaces, but you only have one dice, so it takes you way longer to get

00:27:18.640 --> 00:27:20.120
 between each one.

00:27:20.120 --> 00:27:25.480
 And the game carries on until one player has absolutely everything on the board.

00:27:25.480 --> 00:27:29.960
 So you keep going into more and more and more debt, and basically you just keep going forever

00:27:29.960 --> 00:27:31.800
 until one person wins all the money.

00:27:31.800 --> 00:27:32.800
 That is good, isn't it?

00:27:32.800 --> 00:27:37.960
 Because that is what I have always said about monopoly is that it is just over too fast.

00:27:37.960 --> 00:27:41.200
 Actually, in 2016, Hasbro ran, they are very good at PR stuff.

00:27:41.200 --> 00:27:46.480
 They ran a monopoly helpline from the 24th to the 26th of December to stop literally because

00:27:46.480 --> 00:27:50.840
 they said, people always argue while playing this dreadful board game of ours.

00:27:50.840 --> 00:27:51.840
 Yeah.

00:27:51.840 --> 00:27:56.320
 And the idea was the person at the end of the hotline wouldn't solve this sort of like family

00:27:56.320 --> 00:27:57.320
 dynamic argument.

00:27:57.320 --> 00:28:02.160
 It would be, I will tell you what the official rule that you were disputing, because that is

00:28:02.160 --> 00:28:04.960
 the main thing that, so there would be people.

00:28:04.960 --> 00:28:10.360
 So people in the list of why people would call would be or why the arguments happen.

00:28:10.360 --> 00:28:11.360
 Free parking.

00:28:11.360 --> 00:28:14.440
 No one really knows officially what the rules are, and that would be a big thing that they

00:28:14.440 --> 00:28:16.320
 would argue about.

00:28:16.320 --> 00:28:20.160
 And then it would be stuff like people taking too long to take their turn, someone buying

00:28:20.160 --> 00:28:23.420
 a property that you want when they definitely didn't need it.

00:28:23.420 --> 00:28:24.920
 On the top of the list, it was people being--

00:28:24.920 --> 00:28:25.920
 That's allowed.

00:28:25.920 --> 00:28:26.920
 I know it's allowed.

00:28:26.920 --> 00:28:27.920
 That's the best part of the game.

00:28:27.920 --> 00:28:28.920
 Exactly.

00:28:28.920 --> 00:28:35.240
 Well, this is why your attitude is causing, and yeah, the top being people being too cocky

00:28:35.240 --> 00:28:36.240
 when winning.

00:28:36.240 --> 00:28:41.720
 So this is just a helpline of people who can't be asked to read the instructions, which

00:28:41.720 --> 00:28:44.400
 are all of four pages long, is that what we're saying?

00:28:44.400 --> 00:28:45.400
 Yes.

00:28:45.400 --> 00:28:46.400
 Right.

00:28:46.400 --> 00:28:47.400
 Just checking.

00:28:47.400 --> 00:28:48.400
 Who this was targeting.

00:28:48.400 --> 00:28:51.000
 There are theories about why people argue-- it's not an actual psychological theory, it's

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:52.640
 about why people argue over Christmas.

00:28:52.640 --> 00:28:57.000
 And one theory that I really like is that there are things which are social allergens.

00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:03.720
 So you're not allergic the first time someone makes a time some joke to you over Christmas.

00:29:03.720 --> 00:29:07.160
 But by the fourth or fifth time, you're having a very much stronger reaction, even if it's

00:29:07.160 --> 00:29:10.240
 someone completely different, making that joke again.

00:29:10.240 --> 00:29:11.240
 I don't know.

00:29:11.240 --> 00:29:12.240
 Don't talk too loud.

00:29:12.240 --> 00:29:13.240
 Everyone will want one.

00:29:13.240 --> 00:29:21.520
 Oh, so there was a study done recently, which asked people their main reasons for post-Christmas

00:29:21.520 --> 00:29:22.520
 grumpiness.

00:29:22.520 --> 00:29:25.320
 So people get very depressed in January.

00:29:25.320 --> 00:29:31.040
 It's sort of kind of depressing things, like suicides go off on New Year's days, the biggest

00:29:31.040 --> 00:29:32.040
 day for suicide.

00:29:32.040 --> 00:29:34.640
 But happily Christmas days, the smallest day for suicide.

00:29:34.640 --> 00:29:36.120
 So people hang on.

00:29:36.120 --> 00:29:39.400
 But people get upset in January.

00:29:39.400 --> 00:29:40.400
 And--

00:29:40.400 --> 00:29:41.400
 Can I just apologise for my fact?

00:29:41.400 --> 00:29:44.560
 I've never--

00:29:44.560 --> 00:29:46.160
 Probably if I did this to us, don't I?

00:29:46.160 --> 00:29:47.320
 It's a depressing fact.

00:29:47.320 --> 00:29:51.800
 No, the main reason people get upset after Christmas, apparently, is because, hey, there

00:29:51.800 --> 00:29:53.040
 were a list of 20.

00:29:53.040 --> 00:29:57.320
 One of them was, our house is full of Christmas presents, and I don't want most of them.

00:29:57.320 --> 00:30:02.000
 Which, extremely ungrateful, apparently, children become a complete nightmare because they

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:06.240
 get used to the indulgence of Christmas, which I don't know if that's true, but they become

00:30:06.240 --> 00:30:13.360
 terrorists, basically, and then people cite it chocolate withdrawal symptoms.

00:30:13.360 --> 00:30:15.480
 That's not real.

00:30:15.480 --> 00:30:21.360
 Top 20, why I'm grumpy in January, medical chocolate withdrawal.

00:30:21.360 --> 00:30:26.240
 One bad thing that, in the olden days, would happen just after Christmas, in the 1600s in

00:30:26.240 --> 00:30:30.960
 Wales, they had a tradition where you would beat up the last person to get out of bed on

00:30:30.960 --> 00:30:38.200
 Boxing Day.

00:30:38.200 --> 00:30:40.920
 And is that why it's Boxing Day?

00:30:40.920 --> 00:30:43.920
 No.

00:30:43.920 --> 00:30:48.920
 They would also, around the same time, they would throw food at the wall on Christmas Day,

00:30:48.920 --> 00:30:52.120
 and whenever it's spelled out on the wall, that's who you would marry.

00:30:52.120 --> 00:30:59.200
 What, I mean, did they have alphabetsis spaghetti in 16th century Wales?

00:30:59.200 --> 00:31:00.200
 What?

00:31:00.200 --> 00:31:02.120
 Can you help to spell out?

00:31:02.120 --> 00:31:06.280
 I suppose if they're trifle, they'll go, "Urgh!"

00:31:06.280 --> 00:31:07.720
 Yeah, you're right.

00:31:07.720 --> 00:31:12.800
 I suppose maybe, like, spaghetti, they probably don't have spaghetti in those days, did they?

00:31:12.800 --> 00:31:13.800
 Wow.

00:31:13.800 --> 00:31:15.320
 Have you guys heard the song?

00:31:15.320 --> 00:31:16.320
 An eel.

00:31:16.320 --> 00:31:19.840
 They would get an eel from the table and throw that at them.

00:31:19.840 --> 00:31:22.000
 Again, their name of bed have again with S.

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:24.840
 Oh.

00:31:24.840 --> 00:31:29.760
 Have you guys heard of this song from 2004 called the 12 STIs of Christmas?

00:31:29.760 --> 00:31:30.920
 No.

00:31:30.920 --> 00:31:37.560
 This was a song written by the Department of Health as part of a public safety campaign,

00:31:37.560 --> 00:31:41.480
 and it was to teach people, especially young people, about the risks of unsafe sex.

00:31:41.480 --> 00:31:42.480
 And it started.

00:31:42.480 --> 00:31:46.360
 It had all the verses, so it started on the first day of Christmas.

00:31:46.360 --> 00:31:49.880
 My true love gave to me a bug that made it hard to pee.

00:31:49.880 --> 00:31:53.760
 OK, so that's right, but they kept mixing up the verses all the way along.

00:31:53.760 --> 00:31:58.280
 So I just want to share a verse nine with you on the ninth day of Christmas.

00:31:58.280 --> 00:32:03.360
 My true love gave to me, genital waltz, tricombone, he asks his helper, tightest pubic,

00:32:03.360 --> 00:32:07.520
 lies gonorrhea.

00:32:07.520 --> 00:32:14.240
 Genital herpes syphilis, glermidia, and soles that spread a-na-lea.

00:32:14.240 --> 00:32:19.360
 That's real.

00:32:19.360 --> 00:32:21.120
 That's an official thing.

00:32:21.120 --> 00:32:25.680
 I reckon no one has ever stood on this stage and sung the word gonorrhea quite as beautifully

00:32:25.680 --> 00:32:27.240
 as you did.

00:32:27.240 --> 00:32:32.560
 There was a study in 2016, and it was a Christmas study, so it was quite light-hearted in its

00:32:32.560 --> 00:32:33.560
 intent.

00:32:33.560 --> 00:32:37.320
 But it's had recent estimates show Santa has to travel 510 million kilometres at nearly

00:32:37.320 --> 00:32:42.040
 the speed of light each night before Christmas, while controlling the estimated 5.6 million

00:32:42.040 --> 00:32:48.040
 reindeer necessary to pull his 2.3 million tons sleigh.

00:32:48.040 --> 00:32:52.920
 Considering one fatality in commercial aviation about every three 23 billion passenger kilometres,

00:32:52.920 --> 00:32:58.040
 and assuming that Santa's lay is not considerably safer than a standard aeroplane, Santa would

00:32:58.040 --> 00:33:05.280
 die on duty every 45 years.

00:33:05.280 --> 00:33:07.440
 When's the next one due, do we know?

00:33:07.440 --> 00:33:11.400
 Well, statistically he should have died four times since his first appearance in the 18th

00:33:11.400 --> 00:33:13.440
 century, but he keeps on surviving.

00:33:13.440 --> 00:33:14.440
 He's fine.

00:33:14.440 --> 00:33:15.440
 He's okay.

00:33:15.440 --> 00:33:16.440
 Yeah.

00:33:16.440 --> 00:33:22.320
 They looked at some injuries in America between 2007 and 2016 over Christmas.

00:33:22.320 --> 00:33:28.160
 These are just injuries, but 36,000 people just over died from, sorry, got injured from electrical

00:33:28.160 --> 00:33:35.640
 decorations, 80,000 got injured from other types of decorations, 17,928 got injured from artificial

00:33:35.640 --> 00:33:45.240
 trees, and 277 children were hurt during interactions with a Santa impersonator.

00:33:45.240 --> 00:33:49.360
 And apparently, according to the researchers, their examples they gave is by either falling

00:33:49.360 --> 00:33:53.440
 off his lap or falling while running away in fear.

00:33:53.440 --> 00:34:00.920
 Oh, we need to move on to our final fact of the show, and that is James.

00:34:00.920 --> 00:34:08.480
 Okay, my fat this week is that Mariah Carey has three Christmas trees, one of which is decorated

00:34:08.480 --> 00:34:11.080
 with pictures of herself.

00:34:11.080 --> 00:34:18.960
 Okay, so this is the modern day Santa Claus, Mariah Carey, and she has a main 19-foot

00:34:18.960 --> 00:34:20.880
 tree in her living room.

00:34:20.880 --> 00:34:24.840
 She has a smaller one in her bedroom, and she has one in the family room area that they

00:34:24.840 --> 00:34:27.080
 call the Charlie Brown tree.

00:34:27.080 --> 00:34:32.040
 And it's a really cute, kind of slightly, scraggly looking one, but they put polarise of the

00:34:32.040 --> 00:34:36.080
 family as well, not just her, so it's a nice, it's a nice thing.

00:34:36.080 --> 00:34:40.040
 And she has told us all about what happens at her Christmas.

00:34:40.040 --> 00:34:45.920
 She always takes a plane to Aspen in Colorado, and she comes off the plane and she gets onto

00:34:45.920 --> 00:34:51.160
 a sleigh pulled by reindeer while they play all I want for Christmas is you again and again

00:34:51.160 --> 00:34:52.160
 and again.

00:34:52.160 --> 00:34:55.640
 Yeah, and she absolutely loves that.

00:34:55.640 --> 00:34:58.320
 Actually, she does really like her own music.

00:34:58.320 --> 00:35:00.960
 She likes to do stuff with her own music.

00:35:00.960 --> 00:35:06.000
 According to her ex-husband Nick Chanan, when she gave birth, as the babies came out, they

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:11.040
 were playing a Mariah Carey song, and they didn't just want any old Mariah Carey song.

00:35:11.040 --> 00:35:16.120
 They wanted a live version of Mariah Carey's singing fantasy in Madison Square Garden,

00:35:16.120 --> 00:35:19.880
 so that when the babies came out, they came out to a round of applause.

00:35:19.880 --> 00:35:24.640
 Wow, she is the absolute moby dick of pop divas.

00:35:24.640 --> 00:35:27.280
 She is just, yeah, the perfect.

00:35:27.280 --> 00:35:31.560
 Wait, is the monkey one decorated with pictures of her?

00:35:31.560 --> 00:35:32.560
 Yes.

00:35:32.560 --> 00:35:34.160
 It's just like, like I say, Charlie Brown.

00:35:34.160 --> 00:35:37.120
 It's kind of a more traditionally, kind of a small one.

00:35:37.120 --> 00:35:38.120
 Okay.

00:35:38.120 --> 00:35:39.120
 Yeah.

00:35:39.120 --> 00:35:40.120
 I think it's quite sweet, actually.

00:35:40.120 --> 00:35:47.480
 Yeah, the thing is, Mariah Carey, I think we need a few people who exist in that diva land

00:35:47.480 --> 00:35:52.200
 that we just celebrate as opposed to going there crazy, because it's so amazing to know

00:35:52.200 --> 00:35:54.960
 that there's someone out there just living this insane life.

00:35:54.960 --> 00:35:58.200
 And all these rumours, we don't know which ones are true, and which ones are false.

00:35:58.200 --> 00:36:01.160
 So the things like people say, she never wears a watch.

00:36:01.160 --> 00:36:02.760
 She can whistle with her hands.

00:36:02.760 --> 00:36:03.760
 She never wears a watch.

00:36:03.760 --> 00:36:05.520
 She's not diva behaviour.

00:36:05.520 --> 00:36:08.800
 I mean, you're not wearing a watch right now.

00:36:08.800 --> 00:36:13.920
 Ooh, damn, try by the Mariah Carey of noses, I think it's a fish.

00:36:13.920 --> 00:36:19.120
 She has supposedly an extreme aversion to overhead lighting, and has, as she claims,

00:36:19.120 --> 00:36:21.560
 that elevator lighting is toxic.

00:36:21.560 --> 00:36:25.800
 And the thing is, some people sometimes pick her up on the fact that she has these big

00:36:25.800 --> 00:36:27.920
 rumours about her and ask her about it.

00:36:27.920 --> 00:36:32.080
 And often the answer is crazier than the actual accusation.

00:36:32.080 --> 00:36:35.800
 She was interviewed by someone who said, there's a rumour going around that you only bathe

00:36:35.800 --> 00:36:38.520
 in bottled water, sort of sparkling water.

00:36:38.520 --> 00:36:40.240
 She said, that is insane.

00:36:40.240 --> 00:36:44.040
 I bathe in milk.

00:36:44.040 --> 00:36:47.640
 I don't think that was actually with Mariah Carey, though, that interview, because this was

00:36:47.640 --> 00:36:53.400
 in the Guardian, and the description is so bizarre, but basically, he's sort of led into

00:36:53.400 --> 00:36:55.840
 this room where he says, it's dimly lit, and he can barely make her out.

00:36:55.840 --> 00:36:59.600
 And she's sitting in a weird throne, and then she asked to be moved to a different chair,

00:36:59.600 --> 00:37:00.840
 slash throne, doesn't she?

00:37:00.840 --> 00:37:04.400
 And there's this sort of air throughout that all he can see is her glittering diamonds

00:37:04.400 --> 00:37:08.200
 and sort of the red of her outfit in this weird dimly lit space.

00:37:08.200 --> 00:37:12.320
 And I think she's just sending stand-ins around the world to repeat mad stuff about her.

00:37:12.320 --> 00:37:14.920
 But there are clues that it might have been her.

00:37:14.920 --> 00:37:18.800
 She wasn't wearing a watch for instance.

00:37:18.800 --> 00:37:22.200
 She whistled to beckon him.

00:37:22.200 --> 00:37:27.680
 So this song, all I want for Christmas is you, is, I think it's just over 25 years old.

00:37:27.680 --> 00:37:28.680
 Really?

00:37:28.680 --> 00:37:33.120
 Yeah, it's now an oldie, and when she was told, when Mariah Carey was told that the song

00:37:33.120 --> 00:37:35.680
 was turning 25 years old, she had an amazing response.

00:37:35.680 --> 00:37:39.960
 She just said, I don't acknowledge time.

00:37:39.960 --> 00:37:44.080
 That's why she doesn't wear a watch.

00:37:44.080 --> 00:37:46.960
 She doesn't acknowledge time, because she doesn't have birthdays.

00:37:46.960 --> 00:37:50.000
 We don't truly know when Mariah Carey was born.

00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:51.880
 That's a real thing.

00:37:51.880 --> 00:37:55.440
 She was either born, I think it was in 19...

00:37:55.440 --> 00:37:56.440
 What are the two days?

00:37:56.440 --> 00:37:58.040
 I think it was at 59 or 1960?

00:37:58.040 --> 00:37:59.040
 Yeah, exactly.

00:37:59.040 --> 00:38:00.040
 And we don't fully know.

00:38:00.040 --> 00:38:01.040
 Oh, I'm sorry.

00:38:01.040 --> 00:38:02.680
 She was either born in 1969 or 1970.

00:38:02.680 --> 00:38:04.520
 She was either born in 1969 or 1970.

00:38:04.520 --> 00:38:07.320
 We don't fully know, because we haven't got the birth certificate to tell.

00:38:07.320 --> 00:38:09.040
 But she doesn't have birthdays.

00:38:09.040 --> 00:38:12.640
 She has anniversaries, because she doesn't acknowledge time.

00:38:12.640 --> 00:38:16.000
 Well, it's still acknowledging time if it's an anniversary, isn't it?

00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:18.200
 You just given it a different name.

00:38:18.200 --> 00:38:21.200
 Good point, yeah.

00:38:21.200 --> 00:38:22.520
 She hasn't thought this one through.

00:38:22.520 --> 00:38:26.240
 Yeah, no, she's, I think she's a fascinating character, and the amazing thing, all I want

00:38:26.240 --> 00:38:27.240
 for Christmas is you.

00:38:27.240 --> 00:38:29.520
 She's expanded it into so many territories.

00:38:29.520 --> 00:38:33.600
 There's a movie that she made recently, an animated movie, all I want for Christmas

00:38:33.600 --> 00:38:37.320
 is you, the kids' cartoon, which I watched the other night.

00:38:37.320 --> 00:38:38.320
 She's made...

00:38:38.320 --> 00:38:39.320
 I'm sorry.

00:38:39.320 --> 00:38:40.320
 You watched.

00:38:40.320 --> 00:38:41.320
 Yeah, I saw it the other night.

00:38:41.320 --> 00:38:42.320
 Was it good?

00:38:42.320 --> 00:38:43.320
 Yes, fantastic.

00:38:43.320 --> 00:38:44.320
 Yeah.

00:38:44.320 --> 00:38:45.320
 Did your son enjoy it?

00:38:45.320 --> 00:38:46.320
 He doesn't watch that shit.

00:38:46.320 --> 00:38:47.320
 He's...

00:38:47.320 --> 00:38:48.320
 I put it on.

00:38:48.320 --> 00:38:49.320
 He was like, "I'm out."

00:38:49.320 --> 00:38:55.040
 You went to play with his Thomas the Tank Engine toys, so I watched it on my own.

00:38:55.040 --> 00:38:56.040
 But it's...

00:38:56.040 --> 00:38:58.040
 That is so depressing.

00:38:58.040 --> 00:38:59.040
 Why?

00:38:59.040 --> 00:39:01.320
 It's a fantastic song, a fantastic movie.

00:39:01.320 --> 00:39:04.200
 She's a fantastic human who doesn't acknowledge that time exists.

00:39:04.200 --> 00:39:05.200
 Like, it's...

00:39:05.200 --> 00:39:06.200
 How long is the film?

00:39:06.200 --> 00:39:08.200
 If time doesn't exist.

00:39:08.200 --> 00:39:12.600
 To be fair, it did feel like forever, but by it.

00:39:12.600 --> 00:39:17.080
 There is a whole article deconstructing the meaning of the song "All I Want for Christmas

00:39:17.080 --> 00:39:21.000
 is You" on the Atlantic, which is really good, and it kind of does it slightly academically.

00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:24.320
 So it says, "The author carefully sets out her premises.

00:39:24.320 --> 00:39:28.760
 There exists an entity, I, representing conscious selfhood.

00:39:28.760 --> 00:39:36.040
 This entity exists in relation to material space, a lot, and seasonal time for Christmas.

00:39:36.040 --> 00:39:40.400
 The entity expresses this relationality through the vocabulary of desire or want, and though

00:39:40.400 --> 00:39:44.920
 its desires could theoretically be expansive, they are not.

00:39:44.920 --> 00:39:48.760
 Yet how could we understand the author's examination of Christmas as anything but an implicit

00:39:48.760 --> 00:39:50.760
 critique of capitalism?

00:39:50.760 --> 00:39:52.760
 Hmm.

00:39:52.760 --> 00:39:54.280
 She doesn't want all the other stuff of Christmas.

00:39:54.280 --> 00:39:55.280
 She just wants you.

00:39:55.280 --> 00:39:59.400
 They've plagiarised her notes when she was writing that song, haven't they?

00:39:59.400 --> 00:40:01.560
 Because she did write it, we should say.

00:40:01.560 --> 00:40:04.160
 I didn't quite realise that she wrote all of her songs.

00:40:04.160 --> 00:40:06.600
 I come in my hand when number one she's had, but it doesn't.

00:40:06.600 --> 00:40:08.280
 She did write basically all of them.

00:40:08.280 --> 00:40:09.560
 She co-wrote that one, I think, right?

00:40:09.560 --> 00:40:10.560
 She co-wrote it.

00:40:10.560 --> 00:40:15.800
 I think as a co-writer, she is unique in that she has had one number one hit for every year

00:40:15.800 --> 00:40:18.600
 of the '90s, and no one else has had that.

00:40:18.600 --> 00:40:19.600
 She's had...

00:40:19.600 --> 00:40:20.600
 Yeah.

00:40:20.600 --> 00:40:21.600
 So she's...

00:40:21.600 --> 00:40:22.600
 Oh.

00:40:22.600 --> 00:40:23.600
 Yeah.

00:40:23.600 --> 00:40:25.240
 Or the very least character of them.

00:40:25.240 --> 00:40:26.240
 And there is a theory.

00:40:26.240 --> 00:40:29.200
 Our colleague, James Rawson, who is a big moral carry fan, he has a theory that all the

00:40:29.200 --> 00:40:34.360
 deeper stuff is actually to distract us, and it doesn't draw attention to the fact she's

00:40:34.360 --> 00:40:39.320
 a very good songwriter, and she has a five octave range, which is almost unheard of.

00:40:39.320 --> 00:40:41.480
 But, you know, if she goes on about that, it might sound vain.

00:40:41.480 --> 00:40:43.560
 So she just does the fun, deeper stuff instead.

00:40:43.560 --> 00:40:44.560
 Yeah.

00:40:44.560 --> 00:40:47.080
 Well, though, I don't want to suggest her career is going downhill, but last year she was

00:40:47.080 --> 00:40:49.000
 doing the tube announcements in London.

00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:50.800
 Well, should I say?

00:40:50.800 --> 00:40:52.280
 She did the "Please mind the gap".

00:40:52.280 --> 00:40:53.280
 Well, she did...

00:40:53.280 --> 00:40:54.280
 She did, uh, please...

00:40:54.280 --> 00:40:55.440
 All I want for Christmas is Houston.

00:40:55.440 --> 00:40:56.440
 Ah!

00:40:56.440 --> 00:41:01.560
 Very, very strong.

00:41:01.560 --> 00:41:04.040
 The next train will be along at some point.

00:41:04.040 --> 00:41:05.040
 When?

00:41:05.040 --> 00:41:06.040
 No.

00:41:06.040 --> 00:41:07.040
 No, she did.

00:41:07.040 --> 00:41:13.760
 She did a "Please stand clear of the yellow line", and also have you heard my new album, "Tube

00:41:13.760 --> 00:41:14.760
 Announcement".

00:41:14.760 --> 00:41:15.760
 Wow.

00:41:15.760 --> 00:41:16.760
 But did she actually save the new album, though?

00:41:16.760 --> 00:41:17.760
 She did, yeah.

00:41:17.760 --> 00:41:18.760
 Oh, wow.

00:41:18.760 --> 00:41:22.680
 And this year is a fight like every year for Christmas number one.

00:41:22.680 --> 00:41:24.280
 Last year, it was won by...

00:41:24.280 --> 00:41:30.600
 We built this city on sausage rolls, by Ladd Baby, and as a kind of comment against that,

00:41:30.600 --> 00:41:35.280
 there is a couple called Gavin Chapel Bates and Giles Bryant, who are from Cambridge

00:41:35.280 --> 00:41:40.080
 and Suffolk respectively, and they've recorded a single called "Peace on Your Plate", which

00:41:40.080 --> 00:41:43.680
 is the world's first vegan Christmas single.

00:41:43.680 --> 00:41:49.000
 The lyrics include "Children are playing by the fireside, there's magic at your tide, but

00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:55.200
 in a different land, it's a different scene in a factory shed, the animal's scream".

00:41:55.200 --> 00:42:01.600
 That honestly makes your fact, Dan, look like it's a wonderful life.

00:42:01.600 --> 00:42:08.240
 I think it's on vertical at the first vegan Christmas song, when I think a lot of other

00:42:08.240 --> 00:42:14.280
 Christmas songs haven't been rampantly carnivorous.

00:42:14.280 --> 00:42:16.680
 Do you know who invented Christmas songs?

00:42:16.680 --> 00:42:17.680
 Christmas carols.

00:42:17.680 --> 00:42:21.440
 Oh, it can't have been named after someone called Carol.

00:42:21.440 --> 00:42:23.200
 I wish it was...

00:42:23.200 --> 00:42:28.900
 No, it was a guy called Edward White Benson, who was the Bishop of Truro in the 19th century,

00:42:28.900 --> 00:42:29.900
 late 19th century.

00:42:29.900 --> 00:42:34.000
 And basically, carols were sung in pubs, and he wanted to move them to churches.

00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:37.740
 And he went on to be an Archbishop of Canterbury, he was quite a big deal, but he had this

00:42:37.740 --> 00:42:40.380
 extraordinary family life, so he was married.

00:42:40.380 --> 00:42:47.000
 His wife had, she kept a diary of her lovers, she had 39 lesbian lovers, so she was gay, she

00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:48.140
 kept the diary, she had this.

00:42:48.140 --> 00:42:53.100
 They had six children, four of whom were gay, and two, so there are two sons, one went on

00:42:53.100 --> 00:42:57.500
 to be a famous poet, the other went on to be a famous novelist, one of their two daughters

00:42:57.500 --> 00:43:03.260
 who was gay stole her mother's girlfriend, and he was there being the Archbishop of Canterbury,

00:43:03.260 --> 00:43:04.260
 just...

00:43:04.260 --> 00:43:05.260
 Wow.

00:43:05.260 --> 00:43:09.100
 And then the mother, she was called Mary Benson, and Gladstone, at the time, called Prime Minister,

00:43:09.100 --> 00:43:14.220
 called her the cleverest woman in England, which, you know, she had 39 lovers, that's pretty

00:43:14.220 --> 00:43:15.220
 smart.

00:43:15.220 --> 00:43:21.300
 Yeah, but not when they count all those STDs she got that in.

00:43:21.300 --> 00:43:24.020
 We're going to have to wrap up very shortly.

00:43:24.020 --> 00:43:25.740
 Anything before we do?

00:43:25.740 --> 00:43:27.580
 Just some more Christmas songs.

00:43:27.580 --> 00:43:28.580
 Yeah, yeah.

00:43:28.580 --> 00:43:33.300
 So, for instance, the song "I Saw Mummy Kissing Santa Claus" was condemned by the Roman

00:43:33.300 --> 00:43:39.740
 Catholic Church in Boston, because they said it was showing adultery because mummy is kissing

00:43:39.740 --> 00:43:41.060
 another man.

00:43:41.060 --> 00:43:44.700
 And it was only when the guy who sang the song to me by met with the church leaders to

00:43:44.700 --> 00:43:49.660
 explain that actually in this song, the part of Santa is being played by the father in

00:43:49.660 --> 00:43:51.700
 this.

00:43:51.700 --> 00:43:54.220
 And then they lifted their condemnation.

00:43:54.220 --> 00:43:58.980
 I think it makes sense to release Christmas songs.

00:43:58.980 --> 00:44:04.740
 So, I was looking at the royalties that you get in 2016, Channel 5 did a review of all

00:44:04.740 --> 00:44:07.060
 the biggest songs that gets the "Numor and Royalties."

00:44:07.060 --> 00:44:09.660
 So, she came in at number three.

00:44:09.660 --> 00:44:10.660
 What do you think?

00:44:10.660 --> 00:44:11.660
 Number two and number one.

00:44:11.660 --> 00:44:12.660
 Are they Christmas songs?

00:44:12.660 --> 00:44:13.660
 Christmas songs.

00:44:13.660 --> 00:44:14.900
 I think it'll be Slades, Merry Christmas, everybody.

00:44:14.900 --> 00:44:15.900
 Number one.

00:44:15.900 --> 00:44:16.900
 Yeah.

00:44:16.900 --> 00:44:17.900
 Yeah.

00:44:17.900 --> 00:44:18.900
 How cool is that?

00:44:18.900 --> 00:44:24.660
 And according to this report, they get 1 million pounds in royalties a year from that

00:44:24.660 --> 00:44:25.660
 alone.

00:44:25.660 --> 00:44:26.660
 Slade.

00:44:26.660 --> 00:44:28.660
 Not all of them wrote it though.

00:44:28.660 --> 00:44:31.140
 It's only naughty holder and maybe one of the blues.

00:44:31.140 --> 00:44:32.140
 Yeah.

00:44:32.140 --> 00:44:33.140
 So, probably naughty is getting mostly.

00:44:33.140 --> 00:44:36.020
 They get, they get up between them and the other bandmates get nothing.

00:44:36.020 --> 00:44:37.020
 Yeah.

00:44:37.020 --> 00:44:38.020
 Yeah.

00:44:38.020 --> 00:44:39.020
 No.

00:44:39.020 --> 00:44:40.020
 Yeah.

00:44:40.020 --> 00:44:41.020
 Way.

00:44:41.020 --> 00:44:42.020
 I didn't even say no way.

00:44:42.020 --> 00:44:43.020
 I just said no.

00:44:43.020 --> 00:44:48.500
 But here's the thing, you don't even need to have written a good song that people have heard

00:44:48.500 --> 00:44:49.500
 about.

00:44:49.500 --> 00:44:52.500
 In 1978, there was a guy called Randy Brooks who wrote a song called "Gramma got

00:44:52.500 --> 00:44:55.340
 run over by a reindeer."

00:44:55.340 --> 00:44:57.580
 It's called 40 million copies.

00:44:57.580 --> 00:45:00.380
 It's been covered three times.

00:45:00.380 --> 00:45:03.060
 The family have just been pulling in royalties each year.

00:45:03.060 --> 00:45:04.060
 Yeah.

00:45:04.060 --> 00:45:05.060
 Wow.

00:45:05.060 --> 00:45:06.060
 Why have we not heard of this?

00:45:06.060 --> 00:45:07.060
 Has anyone heard of that?

00:45:07.060 --> 00:45:08.060
 Oh.

00:45:08.060 --> 00:45:09.060
 Oh, really?

00:45:09.060 --> 00:45:10.060
 It's a famous song.

00:45:10.060 --> 00:45:11.060
 Famous song?

00:45:11.060 --> 00:45:12.060
 We just don't know anything.

00:45:12.060 --> 00:45:15.660
 There is a, there is a phone called "Mood Media" which provides tunes to shops.

00:45:15.660 --> 00:45:20.980
 So, you know, 300,000 American shops have this music provided by this one firm.

00:45:20.980 --> 00:45:25.100
 And they have 30 different Christmas music channels.

00:45:25.100 --> 00:45:29.900
 That's how many different kinds of mood shopkeepers might want to evoke in their shops.

00:45:29.900 --> 00:45:30.900
 What?

00:45:30.900 --> 00:45:36.060
 So, if you run a small Christian bookshop, you might not want to have the raunchy Lady Gaga

00:45:36.060 --> 00:45:37.060
 Christmas songs.

00:45:37.060 --> 00:45:38.060
 Oh, yeah.

00:45:38.060 --> 00:45:39.060
 Okay.

00:45:39.060 --> 00:45:42.500
 But if you're selling, if you've got a cool shop for young people, then you might want to

00:45:42.500 --> 00:45:46.380
 play a song called "Christmas in Harlem" by someone called Kanye West.

00:45:46.380 --> 00:45:47.380
 Yeah.

00:45:47.380 --> 00:45:50.580
 Well, those some of the classic Christmas songs are raunchy than you might think.

00:45:50.580 --> 00:45:51.580
 I love them.

00:45:51.580 --> 00:45:55.540
 I think Christmas Carols didn't really start being sung in churches until the 19th century

00:45:55.540 --> 00:45:57.620
 when they had to rewrite lots of them.

00:45:57.620 --> 00:46:02.740
 But, deck the hall, the open deck, the hall with Bowser Holly, the opening line used to

00:46:02.740 --> 00:46:06.900
 be, "Oh, how soft my fair ones, bosom, fa-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la."

00:46:06.900 --> 00:46:07.900
 Wow.

00:46:07.900 --> 00:46:08.900
 Did it really?

00:46:08.900 --> 00:46:12.420
 Yeah, it was a Welsh song about how fit someone's girlfriend was.

00:46:12.420 --> 00:46:13.420
 Of course.

00:46:13.420 --> 00:46:14.420
 Oh, come.

00:46:14.420 --> 00:46:15.420
 Are you faithful?

00:46:15.420 --> 00:46:19.420
 Have you tried their lair to us?

00:46:19.420 --> 00:46:20.420
 Yeah.

00:46:20.420 --> 00:46:25.220
 I just, you know, that song, "Oh, come on, you're faithful."

00:46:25.220 --> 00:46:32.500
 If you sing that, you're technically pleading for the French to invade England.

00:46:32.500 --> 00:46:34.300
 And because...

00:46:34.300 --> 00:46:37.340
 At this stage, why not try it?

00:46:37.340 --> 00:46:39.340
 Like...

00:46:39.340 --> 00:46:45.180
 That feels like the big reset button that we need to hit at this point.

00:46:45.180 --> 00:46:47.180
 Oh.

00:46:47.180 --> 00:46:51.940
 Yeah, it was written by John Francis Wade, who was an English Catholic, and he fled the country

00:46:51.940 --> 00:46:55.460
 during the 1745 rebellion, and he wrote this song.

00:46:55.460 --> 00:47:01.300
 And it was basically, "Oh, come the Catholics to England and save us from the Protestants."

00:47:01.300 --> 00:47:06.900
 That's weird, because he must have screwed up the lyrics, "Come, ye, oh, come, ye to Bert Esleyhem."

00:47:06.900 --> 00:47:07.900
 Unless...

00:47:07.900 --> 00:47:12.740
 Well, he was talking about the Bethlehem in Wales.

00:47:12.740 --> 00:47:14.580
 Okay, that is it.

00:47:14.580 --> 00:47:15.820
 That is all of our facts.

00:47:15.820 --> 00:47:17.620
