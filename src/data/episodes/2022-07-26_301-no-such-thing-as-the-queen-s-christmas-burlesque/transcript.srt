1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,400
 How's he been? Who James?

2
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:07,560
 Father Christmas.

3
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:08,800
 Has he been where?

4
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:11,800
 To your house to give you presents, because it's Christmas Day!

5
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:13,040
 It is Christmas Day!

6
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:14,040
 Yes!

7
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:19,800
 He has, he went down the chimney of my laptop to deliver me a new episode of No Such Thing As A Fish.

8
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:20,800
 Amazing.

9
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:21,800
 Yes!

10
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:26,800
 What we have got for you today a little bit earlier than scheduled is our Christmas special recorded

11
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:30,880
 live in the most Christmasy of places Birmingham!

12
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:32,680
 Oh, it was so Christmassy.

13
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:33,920
 It was so Christmassy.

14
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:37,520
 There was stuff outside, there were lights, there were German sausages.

15
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:38,760
 So many German sausages.

16
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:40,560
 It was like flippy lapland.

17
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:41,560
 It was.

18
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:42,560
 It was Christmas.

19
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:43,560
 It was Christmas City.

20
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:46,280
 It was such a fun episode to do.

21
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:49,000
 We enjoyed ourselves, like we always do in Birmingham.

22
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,480
 It's one of the best places that we go and visit, really, really hope you enjoy it.

23
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:56,200
 It's full of Christmassy facts that you can tell all of your family over the Christmas

24
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:57,200
 table.

25
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:58,440
 Over the Christmas table?

26
00:00:58,440 --> 00:00:59,440
 Over it.

27
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:00,440
 Over the Christmas table.

28
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:03,520
 Get over that table and tell them our facts.

29
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:06,640
 Well, hey, this has been successful.

30
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,240
 Enjoy your day.

31
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:09,240
 That's the main thing.

32
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:11,760
 Yeah, the main thing is that you have a really good day.

33
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:12,760
 Enjoy your Christmas.

34
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:17,480
 Hope you got lots of amazing presents, and here is an extra rarely episode of No Such Thing

35
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:18,480
 As A Fish.

36
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:19,480
 Oh, ho, ho, ho.

37
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:20,480
 Such Thing As A Fish.

38
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:21,480
 Sure.

39
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:28,480
 Okay, on with the podcast.

40
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:31,760
 On with the son of God, cast not like.

41
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:36,760
 On with the son of God, cast not like.

42
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:59,280
 Hello, and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing As A Fish, a weekly podcast this

43
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:04,040
 week coming to you live from Birmingham!

44
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:13,160
 My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here with Anna Chazinski, Andrew Hunter Murray and

45
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:17,800
 James Harkin, and once again, we have gathered around the microphones this time with our four

46
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:25,680
 favorite Christmas facts from the last seven days, and in no particular order, here we go.

47
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:32,840
 Starting with you, Andy, my fact is that in 1958, the Queen's speech was lost on the

48
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:38,440
 day of delivery, and then found by a nearby poodle.

49
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:41,200
 It's a heartwarming Christmas story for the ages.

50
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:44,700
 Oh, though what it says to me is that the cogs are really shit at fundamentally.

51
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:47,720
 Yeah, that's true.

52
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:52,280
 This was in 1958, so obviously she hadn't been done many of these speeches before, pretty

53
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:56,280
 nerve-wracking, still live delivery, and one of the most important copies of the speech,

54
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:01,160
 one with all the producers' notes on it, was lost, and then found by a poodle.

55
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:03,720
 So what was the poodle doing there?

56
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:06,080
 I thought security was quite tight around the Queen.

57
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:10,120
 I think it was not by the Queen, so if it, I mean she would have found it, if it would have

58
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,120
 been next to her.

59
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,800
 But surely, it must have been near the Queen.

60
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,880
 I think it was at a nearby train station, was it?

61
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:16,880
 What?

62
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:19,200
 So this poodle has no involvement in the story.

63
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,360
 Well, no, he's the main protagonist in the story.

64
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,000
 I don't know if you heard the story.

65
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,800
 Sorry, no, so what I mean is it's not like the poodle was in Buckingham Palace going

66
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:32,400
 to have lost script, I'm on it. No, no, no, no, no, they didn't summon it in to find the script.

67
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,400
 And did they?

68
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:38,000
 No, no, no, they didn't summon it in to find, Jesus.

69
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,440
 You don't say I've lost a script somewhere in the United Kingdom, I need one poodle.

70
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:47,880
 The poodle at a train station noticed a bag, there was a bag, and the poodle went over

71
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:48,880
 and explored it.

72
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,920
 I can't remember the name of the poodle, I don't think I wrote it down.

73
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:53,160
 How did he know it was the Queen's speech?

74
00:03:53,160 --> 00:04:02,600
 Well, he did a sort of series of mimes to his master.

75
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:05,400
 The owner of the poodle was a guy called John Harvey, who then took it to the police.

76
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:09,320
 The Queen's speech was saved, and things just carried on.

77
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:10,320
 That's normal.

78
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:11,320
 Right.

79
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:14,320
 Thank God, because where would we have been without that speech?

80
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,320
 Right, right.

81
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:18,520
 Everyone remembers the 1958, right?

82
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:23,440
 I remember the 1959 speech, and when I say I remember, I'm not that old, but I can tell

83
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:28,320
 you about the 1959 speech, because it was the first speech that had a joke in it, as far

84
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:33,200
 as I can see, because I read through the early ones, and this one, the Queen said, she explained

85
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:37,000
 all the places they were going, all these new countries in the Commonwealth, and she

86
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,400
 said, "So between us, we are going to many parts of the world.

87
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:43,640
 We have no plans for space travel at the moment."

88
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:48,680
 I mean, I'm not saying there was a great joke.

89
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:52,680
 It passes our bar for jokes, but I'm not sure it passes many people's.

90
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:54,960
 There was a good one in 1957.

91
00:04:54,960 --> 00:05:00,640
 I mean, like, classic in 1957, I would say, again, it was still live, and the Queen was doing

92
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:01,640
 her speech.

93
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:07,440
 And mid-speech, there was interference in the signal for the speech itself on TV.

94
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:12,800
 So while people were watching, suddenly they could hear American police officers coming

95
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:17,600
 over in place of the Queen speaking, and the line that was heard most by most people was,

96
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,080
 "Jo, I'm going to go grab a quick coffee."

97
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:25,280
 That was suddenly just in the middle of the Queen's speech in 1957.

98
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:28,280
 Some of them, they put them out on telly, but there was no picture.

99
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:33,520
 Yeah, I think between 1952 and 1957, they realised they had television now, and so they brought

100
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:38,560
 us on TV, but she didn't have a makeup done or something, so the first TV broadcast was

101
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:42,880
 in 1957, wasn't it, where you could actually see her, but before that, you could just listen

102
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:45,000
 to her, but watching a black TV screen.

103
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
 Wow.

104
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
 Well, we're in it.

105
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,640
 So people might not have really known much about the Queen what she looked like and stuff

106
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:51,640
 like that.

107
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:55,880
 So when they heard someone saying, "Jo, I'm going to get a coffee," did they maybe think it

108
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:57,360
 was the Queen doing that?

109
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,360
 Yeah.

110
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:03,280
 I think from all the money they knew what she looked like.

111
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:08,720
 Yeah.

112
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,120
 Okay, here's a challenge for you.

113
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:14,560
 Can you guys guess one thing that she never does while she is recording the speech?

114
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,560
 Perlesque.

115
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,120
 That's fair.

116
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:20,320
 That's technically the correct answer.

117
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,920
 It's a correct answer.

118
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:24,600
 I've never seen her stuffing a turkey.

119
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,600
 Yes.

120
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,600
 And you've got to re-frame the question.

121
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,520
 I think I've got for a long time.

122
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:30,120
 She never takes a wee.

123
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,920
 She never stands on her head.

124
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:36,880
 She doesn't smile in a genuine way.

125
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,600
 She does her kind of queen smile.

126
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:43,680
 She doesn't do this sort of big, friendly smile.

127
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,960
 She has a kind of controlled smile.

128
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:47,160
 She's got a queen smile.

129
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,160
 That's cool.

130
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,160
 Yeah, but there is.

131
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:52,360
 There was a time where the soundman decided, "Oh, she's got such a nice smile.

132
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:55,000
 I'm going to see if I can make a smile during a thing."

133
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,920
 So he attached a sign saying, "Smile to the camera boom arm."

134
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:07,640
 And he put a sprig of holly and some tinsel next to it, and she saw it and she immediately frowned.

135
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:12,000
 And he was less victim of capital punishment to this country, I'll say.

136
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:17,400
 I discovered while reading about the Queen's Christmas Broadcast set, she is a podcast pioneer.

137
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,400
 Is she?

138
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,400
 Yeah.

139
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:23,360
 The Queen's speech was released as a podcast in 2006.

140
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,360
 Wow.

141
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,360
 Wow.

142
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,360
 We started in 2014.

143
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:28,360
 Like, that's how distant it is.

144
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:34,560
 And I haven't heard it, but I assume it's the same as the speech, but yeah, it's not very long.

145
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,560
 It'd be very long.

146
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:39,720
 You know, she could have done a podcast slant once Father wrote a pardo.

147
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,720
 That's why it's not...

148
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:42,720
 Queen's speech.

149
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:43,720
 Stop the Queen's speech.

150
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:44,720
 Hello.

151
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,720
 We're sponsored this week.

152
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,720
 Right.

153
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:48,720
 The Royal Mint.

154
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,720
 My all of you.

155
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,720
 Of course, before the Queen's speech was the Queen's speech.

156
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:52,720
 It was the King's speech.

157
00:07:52,720 --> 00:08:00,240
 All right, so it started.

158
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:05,320
 I think the first one was 1932, although it only became a yearly thing in '39.

159
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:10,560
 And 1932, actually, so John Rhys, who was general manager of the BBC at the time, had been

160
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:14,440
 trying to persuade King George V to do a King's speech for years.

161
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:15,440
 And he really didn't want to.

162
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:20,200
 He was sweetly shy and nervous and thought he wasn't a very good speaker and was a technophobe,

163
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:23,400
 so didn't really understand this new fangled radio thing.

164
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:27,200
 And he finally was persuaded to do it when it turned out that Roger Kipling was going to

165
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:29,800
 write it for him and then he thought, "Okay, well that sounds good."

166
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:30,800
 He wrote it for him.

167
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,000
 Yeah, he wrote the speech for him.

168
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
 Jungle Book guy.

169
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,280
 Yeah, Jungle Book guy as some people know him better.

170
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,280
 What a speech.

171
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:40,280
 The bare necessities.

172
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:42,280
 The simple.

173
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:45,480
 No, it wasn't.

174
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,120
 He wrote some other stuff as well.

175
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,120
 Okay, cool.

176
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,600
 Yeah, so it was one of those other things.

177
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:55,800
 Apparently, King George, from his naval days, I read, felt most comfortable in small rooms.

178
00:08:55,800 --> 00:09:00,360
 And so he, even though they made a fake recording studio, which was one of the grand rooms in

179
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:05,840
 the palace, he actually recorded it in a box room under the stairs at Sandringham House.

180
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,880
 And yeah, it was Harry Potter.

181
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:10,160
 It was like Harry Potter, yeah.

182
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,160
 His hand was shaking.

183
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:14,200
 If you listen to it, you can hear the paper rustling because his hand was shaking so much.

184
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,200
 Wow.

185
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,400
 And he said it ruined his Christmas.

186
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,400
 Oh.

187
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:22,600
 Guess who produced the, can you, see, I've got another Christmas challenge for you.

188
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:23,600
 Yeah.

189
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:27,760
 See if you can guess who produced the messages between 1986 and 1991.

190
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,560
 Was it Dieter Von Tees?

191
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:30,560
 Oh, yeah.

192
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:34,000
 I wish I hadn't got you that book about Burlesque.

193
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:39,200
 No, it was not Dieter Von Tees.

194
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,200
 So a BBC producer.

195
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,200
 Yeah, but also a friend of the Queen's.

196
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,200
 Friend of the Queen's.

197
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,200
 Oh, Prince Charles.

198
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,200
 David Attenborough.

199
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,200
 David Attenborough.

200
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,200
 Yeah.

201
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,200
 Great fact.

202
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:53,960
 It's just not his normal thing, is it, you know?

203
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:57,960
 But he was, was he the guy, he was quite a famous producer before he did his other service.

204
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:58,960
 He was in the '60s, yeah.

205
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:03,040
 Is he the guy who, I might get this wrong, but is he the guy who decided to put Snooker

206
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,200
 on television to sell Colour TV's?

207
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,200
 Yes.

208
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,200
 Yes.

209
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:11,640
 It was when he was a control of BBC One, I think, when he said to sell Colour TV.

210
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:15,080
 Can I say, that's just a tiny bit worse than me saying, is that the Jungle Book guy to

211
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:19,560
 say David Attenborough is either Snooker guy?

212
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:25,400
 Well, coming from you, the Queen, is that the woman off the money?

213
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:29,080
 Oh, why do we always argue at Christmas?

214
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:32,360
 Some more stuff about TV and movies around Christmas.

215
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,360
 Oh, yeah.

216
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,360
 Something like that.

217
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:38,320
 So there were four Flintstones Christmas specials, which, how exactly, they celebrate

218
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,320
 Christ's birth?

219
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,320
 I don't really know.

220
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,320
 Oh, yeah.

221
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:42,320
 Oh, yeah.

222
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,320
 They were pioneers.

223
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:51,000
 And there was a, there is a YouTuber called Jake Roper, and he decided to look at that classic

224
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:57,280
 Christmas movie Home Alone, and he found out that he looks at all the tricks that Kevin

225
00:10:57,280 --> 00:11:01,680
 played on the burglars and found out what would happen in real life.

226
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:05,920
 So apparently, shame on me, I haven't seen this movie, but I believe this is what happened.

227
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:06,920
 Wow.

228
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:07,920
 I know.

229
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:12,960
 James, that's a better fact than whatever you're about to tell us.

230
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:18,000
 So apparently, at one stage, he heats up a door knob, and they burn their hand.

231
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,000
 And apparently, the temperatures needed to transfer enough heat to the outside knob would

232
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,480
 have melted the door or set the house on fire.

233
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:30,600
 But there is a crowbar that goes to the chest of one of the burglars, but that would have

234
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:33,560
 punctured his lungs and his heart.

235
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:36,800
 But it wouldn't matter, because Kevin would have already murdered both of them with the

236
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:43,400
 paint can trap. Apparently the force of those paint cans would have killed both of them.

237
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:44,760
 That would be a very different movie.

238
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:45,760
 What do you mean?

239
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:46,760
 Yes.

240
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:47,760
 How do you know?

241
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:48,760
 You don't know.

242
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:49,760
 I'm assuming.

243
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:50,760
 Maybe they both die.

244
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:51,760
 It is weird.

245
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:54,880
 It's like watching you read a foreign language where you don't understand it.

246
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:58,360
 You obviously don't quite know what, what this is in reference to at all.

247
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:00,680
 Look, I read the synopsis on Wikipedia.

248
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:04,040
 Do you know there's such a weird thing about Home Alone?

249
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:09,400
 So Joe Pesci, who was the bad guy who's not an idiot, he obviously was more used to doing

250
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:10,400
 kind of gangster films.

251
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:12,000
 He's in quite a lot of serious gangster films.

252
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,400
 And I think he might have thought this was a similar thing, so we went really method in

253
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:16,400
 Home Alone.

254
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:21,920
 So on the set of Home Alone, he refused to see Macauley Culkin at all, because he wanted

255
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:24,040
 Macauley to be really, really terrified of him.

256
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:27,320
 So you know, he didn't want to kill the magic of him being this bad guy.

257
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:31,520
 And in the scene where which you may remember, and I do remember, and James doesn't remember

258
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:37,040
 where he's hung up on a coat hook at one point, if you remember, by his coat.

259
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:41,000
 And Joe Pesci says to him, "I'm going to bite all your fingers off one at a time."

260
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:46,120
 And in one of the rehearsals, he actually bit Culkin really, really hard and drew blood,

261
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:47,640
 and he still has a scar.

262
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:48,640
 Really?

263
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:49,640
 Yeah.

264
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:53,000
 Apparently, this little nine-year-old boy had to do a screaming fit and be like, "I don't

265
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,800
 care how many Oscars you've got, don't go around biting nine-year-olds."

266
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:57,800
 Ah.

267
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:03,000
 That's apparently an ET when they were filming it, Steven Spielberg needed Drew Barrymore

268
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,520
 to cry during a scene, there's a scene where she really solbs.

269
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:10,560
 And behind the scenes of it is that apparently before the take was done, Steven Spielberg leaned

270
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:13,600
 into her going, "It's going to be a good scene.

271
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,600
 You know, you'll be great.

272
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:15,600
 You'll be great."

273
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,080
 By the way, your dog just died.

274
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:21,040
 And then walked back, and she burst out crying, and that's her genuinely crying.

275
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,040
 Wow.

276
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:24,880
 Anyway, Merry Christmas.

277
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:30,200
 We need to move on to our next fact.

278
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:33,840
 Time for fact number two, and that is Chazinski.

279
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:39,160
 My fact this week is that as well as being the birthplace of Jesus, Bethlehem is also where

280
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:43,160
 we found the oldest known depiction of people having sex.

281
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:44,160
 Yeah.

282
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:52,440
 Of which is very, that's very ironic, because famously, that was a sex-free zone.

283
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,440
 Oh, yeah.

284
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,440
 Yeah.

285
00:13:54,440 --> 00:14:00,640
 As a sex-free zone, it was just they had two people of many people had sex, right?

286
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:01,640
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

287
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:03,200
 But it is related to non-sex.

288
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:07,720
 They, Mary and Joseph, didn't have access to this piece of art, otherwise they would have

289
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:08,720
 known what to do.

290
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,720
 But they didn't have instructions.

291
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:11,720
 Yeah.

292
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:13,800
 So, yeah, I think this is such a weird coincidence.

293
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:16,280
 This is a really quite a beautiful piece of art.

294
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:17,280
 It's made of calcite.

295
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:22,280
 It's from 11,000 years ago, so it's a stone-aged piece of art, and it's kind of this couple

296
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:27,240
 of Androgenous humans sort of, I don't know how sex works when they're that Androgenous,

297
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:32,680
 but sort of intertwined, like legs over each other, look it up, it's very nice.

298
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:43,080
 Face to face, so the traditional way, and it, sure, sure, you could specify, but not missionary

299
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:44,080
 I would say.

300
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:48,520
 Well, when you look at it, it's quite hard to tell if it was meant to be upright or horizontal.

301
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:53,200
 So that's sort of in the eye of the beholder.

302
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,200
 Anyway.

303
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:58,040
 I'm really looking forward to your BBC 4 documentary on the history of art.

304
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:03,360
 So this, it is, when I first looked at it, I thought it just looked like a rock.

305
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,360
 Okay.

306
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:07,040
 Maybe I'm just not into my art, as much as other is.

307
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,040
 It doesn't look like a rock.

308
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:10,920
 It looks like two people gloriously intertwined.

309
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:11,920
 Sure.

310
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:12,920
 Okay.

311
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:16,680
 But according to artist Mark Quinn, depending on the perspective and how you look at it,

312
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:23,040
 it also resembles a penis, breasts, or a vagina, depending on which way you kind of move

313
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,040
 it around.

314
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:25,520
 So it's like a bit of trick art.

315
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:26,520
 Oh, cool.

316
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:30,720
 It is, it is very cool that that, because if you put it, if you put it sort of sideways onto

317
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:34,360
 you, so it says widest, it looks like the couple, one next to each other, and then if you move

318
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:37,960
 it so it's sort of end on, it looks like a penis.

319
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:39,840
 And then on the base, there's a cheeky vagina.

320
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:42,520
 So it's a very, it is amazing.

321
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:43,520
 A cheeky vagina.

322
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:45,120
 It's a dream for the price of one, isn't it?

323
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,120
 Yeah, it is.

324
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:51,560
 So basically your pawn hub of 10,000 years ago, because you could just search for any of

325
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:54,240
 three things, and then you would get it.

326
00:15:54,240 --> 00:16:00,120
 Anyway, so it was found in the 1930s by some Bedouin Shepherd boys, and obviously it's now

327
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:02,040
 in the British Museum.

328
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:06,520
 It's quite nice that it was Shepherd.

329
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:07,520
 That's cool.

330
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:08,520
 Isn't it?

331
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:09,520
 Just watching the flock.

332
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:10,520
 Right.

333
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:11,520
 Yeah.

334
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:16,640
 The Deppers looked at their horny rock by night.

335
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:17,880
 Is that a star in this guy?

336
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:18,880
 Doesn't matter.

337
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:21,560
 Keep looking at the rock.

338
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:22,560
 We have no evidence.

339
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:25,280
 They got any kind of arousal out of it.

340
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:27,360
 They just, they found it, and then they gave it to an archaeologist.

341
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:31,800
 It's in an area just sort of within a few miles of Bethem, called Ain Sacri, and it's in

342
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:33,280
 a cave.

343
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:39,200
 And yeah, made by the Natufians, who were, they're called a sedentary people, which isn't as

344
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,640
 insulting as it sounds.

345
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:45,240
 It just means that they were not nomadic, very unusually for that time.

346
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:46,240
 They weren't nomadic.

347
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:49,240
 I think they're my favourite group of people from history than the Deppers.

348
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:50,240
 Really?

349
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:54,400
 Yeah, because the first example we have of anyone who domesticated the dog, they're the

350
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:56,840
 first examples we have of a big feast.

351
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:59,640
 They were the first example we have of beer.

352
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:02,880
 It might be just people are looking in that place and so on and so on.

353
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:06,600
 But I think they sound like a really cool bunch of people.

354
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:14,520
 The first known beer, I think, is 13,000 years BP, which is not a petrol reference.

355
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:17,960
 But so I didn't know about this phrase, but it sounds for before present.

356
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:21,120
 And I don't know why we need it when we have BC.

357
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:25,880
 But so it's 13,000 years BP, so I guess about 11,000 years BC.

358
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:30,000
 And when do you think before present, it sort of starts from, as in this?

359
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,160
 Well, just when you said it a few seconds ago.

360
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,160
 But not anymore.

361
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:34,760
 Now it's now.

362
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:35,760
 And so forth.

363
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:36,760
 Is it not that?

364
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:39,200
 I'm going to have to say your first answer.

365
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,200
 And it's not.

366
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,200
 It's 1950.

367
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,200
 OK, boomer.

368
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:51,240
 It's not when archaeologists just decided the present is 1950.

369
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:52,240
 That is so strange.

370
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,240
 It's really weird.

371
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:57,440
 It's because some people think it's like where there was atomic bombs.

372
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:58,440
 It's exactly that.

373
00:17:58,440 --> 00:17:59,440
 It's that because of it.

374
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:03,440
 And so then any rocks from then on have some kind of radioactivity, so you can't use carbon

375
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:04,440
 dating as well.

376
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:09,440
 Everything's kind of screwed up after 1950 because of all the nuclear shit, as you say.

377
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:12,400
 There's a theory that it's the other Bethlehem.

378
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:18,280
 But it's the Bethlehem that we have where there is a church and a cave and all the tourism

379
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:19,280
 and religion.

380
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:20,280
 Why do you know the Bethlehem?

381
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:21,280
 There's one in Wales, for instance.

382
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:22,280
 It's not that one.

383
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:23,280
 I know there's one in Pennsylvania.

384
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,280
 It's not that one.

385
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:26,040
 There's one in the Galilee.

386
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:29,840
 And an Israeli archaeologist has said that although there probably won't be any proof

387
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:34,280
 due to modern building work, a lot of Jesus' life happened near the other

388
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:39,960
 Galilee or near the Galilee, and also that one is only a few hours of a walk from Nazareth,

389
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:43,680
 which is where Mary and Joseph traditionally came from.

390
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:47,400
 So it's more reasonable that a pregnant, heavily pregnant woman would have walked for a few

391
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,400
 hours.

392
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:52,560
 But did they say that they spent like weeks in the desert walking from one place to the

393
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:53,560
 other?

394
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:55,560
 They must have got really lost if it's this one right now.

395
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:56,560
 That's true.

396
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:57,560
 That's the thing they did, though.

397
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:58,560
 That's the weird thing.

398
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:04,240
 So the Nativity, the birth of Jesus is only mentioned in two of the Gospels anyway, Luke and Matthew,

399
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:06,280
 and it's only in Luke that they make the journey.

400
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:08,480
 So Matthew, they're already living in Bethlehem.

401
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:12,360
 And even in Matthew, this is the extent of the whole journey that we have, the impression

402
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:14,040
 of the donkey and the long trip.

403
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:18,800
 He just says, "You know it was for a census, so they both confirmed that they were going

404
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:21,840
 to Bethlehem for a census and they sort of happened to have a child while they were

405
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:22,840
 there.

406
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:26,360
 But when Joseph went to be registered with Mary, he was expecting a child.

407
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:29,720
 While they were there, she gave birth and wrapped him in bounds of cloth and laid him in a

408
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:32,240
 manger because there was no place for him in the inn."

409
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,240
 And that's it.

410
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:34,240
 That's all we have.

411
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:37,960
 And all the other stuff is from later the donkey, the long journey, the cave, it all comes

412
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:39,960
 from the proto-gospel of James.

413
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:42,080
 Wait, you didn't say the cave, did you?

414
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,080
 The cave.

415
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:44,080
 Oh, the cave, sorry.

416
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,080
 Yeah.

417
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:48,320
 They cracked open a cave and had a whale of a time.

418
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:53,480
 Traditional English Christmases used to have a mint pie in the shape of a manger and

419
00:19:53,480 --> 00:20:01,360
 you would put a little Christ child doll in the pie, based on the pie, on the pie, which

420
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:04,480
 was sort of shaped like a manger, like kind of trough.

421
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:07,360
 And then you would put the Christ child in it and then at dinner time you would eat the

422
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:08,360
 pie.

423
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:09,560
 So sorry, did you eat the Jesus?

424
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:10,560
 No, you didn't eat the Jesus.

425
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:13,800
 The Jesus, I think, was an annual decoration to be done every year.

426
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:14,800
 Yes.

427
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:16,800
 The pie was just, the pie was the edible bit.

428
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:17,800
 See.

429
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:18,800
 She's complaining to the waiter.

430
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:22,960
 Wait a waiter, there's a Jesus in my pie.

431
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:25,240
 What comes next?

432
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:26,240
 Is there an ending to that joke?

433
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:27,240
 Are you joking?

434
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:28,240
 With the fly.

435
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:29,240
 Yeah, you are.

436
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:30,240
 No, no.

437
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,240
 What's the end to the fly joke?

438
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:32,240
 Oh, my God.

439
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,240
 Should we sit together?

440
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:35,040
 There's a fly in my soup.

441
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:36,040
 Don't you?

442
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:37,040
 Don't you?

443
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:38,040
 Don't you?

444
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:39,040
 Don't you?

445
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:40,040
 Don't you?

446
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:41,040
 Don't you?

447
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:42,040
 Everyone will want one.

448
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:43,040
 That's dated.

449
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:46,840
 It's the way we told it.

450
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:49,840
 Do you guys know where the animals come from and the nativity?

451
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:53,560
 You know where you usually have an ox and a kind of a duck in it, so they're not mentioned

452
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:54,560
 in the Bible either.

453
00:20:54,560 --> 00:21:00,840
 They're not mentioned in the Bible, but they come from the gospel of pseudo Matthew, who

454
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:04,600
 appeared in the eighth century and claimed he should have remembered all this stuff.

455
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:08,760
 No, so pseudo Matthew wrote the gospel, which is where we get a lot of onitivity ideas.

456
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:14,040
 And he introduced the stable where Jesus was born and adds an ox and an ass, but he also

457
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:18,160
 added to the scene lions, leopards and dragons.

458
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:19,160
 No.

459
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:20,160
 That's so cool.

460
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:21,160
 Yeah, that's correct.

461
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:25,040
 If you want to do the nativity properly, if you're having an ox, you might as well have a lion,

462
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:26,040
 a leopard and a dragon.

463
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:29,280
 He said they were all wagging their tails to show their devotion.

464
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:33,400
 Have we spoken about nativity thefts?

465
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:35,400
 I can't remember if we've ever talked about it before.

466
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:37,400
 Are people stealing nativity scenes?

467
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:38,400
 Yeah, it is.

468
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:43,200
 And so there's been a huge rash of this in lots of places in the last few years, so there

469
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:50,820
 is another Bethlehem in Pennsylvania, and there a woman stole the crib in 2016 and broke

470
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:51,820
 a bit.

471
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:54,200
 The chief of police had to glue baby Jesus' leg back on.

472
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:56,200
 It was very embarrassing.

473
00:21:56,200 --> 00:22:01,080
 So they had to put a security camera solely on the baby Jesus when they reinstalled it.

474
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:02,560
 But this keeps happening.

475
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:08,840
 So there's a place in Wisconsin called West Bend where 2017 Jesus was stolen, then they

476
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:09,840
 found it.

477
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:10,840
 They replaced the Jesus.

478
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:14,520
 And Chris was Eve, it was stolen again, the baby Jesus.

479
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:18,880
 And there was a police officer who saw a woman suspiciously cradling something.

480
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:22,240
 I don't know how you do that.

481
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:24,240
 And it was the replacement baby Jesus, they put back in.

482
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:25,840
 And the officer yelled, "Belie, stop."

483
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:28,040
 And she dropped the Jesus and pegged it.

484
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:32,760
 So now in West Bend, everything is bolted, literally everything is bolted down.

485
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:36,720
 The baby Jesus is plastered to the manger.

486
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:40,480
 And there is a camera which has hunting technology where when someone leans in for a

487
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:46,800
 closer look, a motion-activated trail camera kicks in and starts recording their every move.

488
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:49,500
 We need to move on in a sec to our next fact.

489
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:51,600
 We could talk about some erotic art.

490
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:52,600
 Oh, okay, yeah.

491
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:53,600
 Oh, sure.

492
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:59,200
 Well, I just wanted to quickly mention another very old piece of art, which is all the statues

493
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:03,440
 of this Egyptian god called Min, who I didn't know existed, but he was a god of fertility.

494
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:08,360
 And you see little sculptures of him from around the fourth millennium BC.

495
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:13,720
 So bloody long time ago, and he has a very close association with lettuce, and that is because

496
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:19,200
 so he's, oh, if you look at him, he's always seen standing with a very erect, very long penis,

497
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:22,240
 which he's cradling in his left hand, I think.

498
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:24,400
 And then he's associated with lettuce, which was…

499
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:25,720
 Suspiciously cradling.

500
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:30,440
 That's how you always suspiciously cradle something.

501
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:32,440
 If it's a penis, it is always suspicious.

502
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:35,000
 I don't know how she was cradling the baby Jesus though, is it?

503
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
 No, no, it was not.

504
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
 I'm sure.

505
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:41,300
 But, yeah, he was the god of fertility and associated with lettuce, and it was thought the lettuce

506
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:45,480
 was the most aphrodisiacal food stuff, because it looks like a penis.

507
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:50,000
 But also, if you break a leaf off a lettuce, it oozes kind of white substance, and so this

508
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
 was really revered.

509
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,680
 Sorry, I must say that these are old lettuces that you would get in ancient Egypt.

510
00:23:54,680 --> 00:24:00,280
 If you go to St. Brees and get an iceberg, what it doesn't look like a penis, and to it

511
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:01,760
 doesn't ooze white liquid.

512
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:02,760
 It looks a tiny bit.

513
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:07,440
 Is that remain long, romaine, long phallic thing, but yeah, it looks less like a penis and

514
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:08,440
 doesn't do the oozing?

515
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:11,720
 Waiter, waiter, there's a penis in my lettuce.

516
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:15,120
 That one actually doesn't have an ending.

517
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,920
 Sorry, can I say one last thing about nativity?

518
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:18,920
 Sorry.

519
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:20,560
 It's just there was a nativity set available on Amazon.

520
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:25,360
 I've read a lot of reviews of nativity sets that you can buy for yourself, and there is

521
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:32,720
 one set that is available on Amazon for £3.69, so this is a very, you know, cost.

522
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:33,720
 Reasonably priced.

523
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:37,960
 Reasonably priced, nativity set, and the main review for it says this, bearing in mind

524
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:42,640
 the price, I did not expect a work of art, but I did hope for something tasteful.

525
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:45,000
 The three figurines were tatty and badly painted.

526
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:49,000
 Joseph had white paint splattered all over his cloak and down his staff.

527
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,040
 The bit, the bit, no, stop.

528
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:55,080
 Are you sure that wasn't lettuce juice?

529
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:59,560
 It gets, like this nativity gets worse, the beard on the right side of his face was higher

530
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:03,120
 than the left and covered his whole nose.

531
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:05,120
 Mary's paintwork was even tattier.

532
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:08,120
 She has two left hands.

533
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:13,360
 Baby Jesus has a right eye that is twice the size of his left eye and his mouth is on the

534
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:16,360
 right side of his face.

535
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:17,360
 So it is an optimist thing.

536
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:20,520
 And there was no dragon.

537
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:24,360
 Oh, we need to move on to our next fact.

538
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:28,640
 Okay, it is time for fact number three, and that is my fact.

539
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:33,600
 My fact this week is the most likely time in the year to have a heart attack is during

540
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:37,400
 a family Christmas gathering.

541
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:38,760
 This is absolutely true.

542
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:40,760
 This was research that was done in Sweden.

543
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:43,680
 They looked at data of 283,000 heart attacks.

544
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:49,920
 It took place in the country between 1998 and 2013, and they found that at 10pm on December

545
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:55,200
 the 24th, which is when the Swedes celebrate, that is when the Christmas gatherings happen,

546
00:25:55,200 --> 00:26:00,040
 that is when it was most likely to happen, 37% more likely to happen on Christmas Eve,

547
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:04,720
 then say 20% on New Year's Day or any other period of the year.

548
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:05,720
 That is really good.

549
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:13,800
 They got this information from a database they have of 283,000 heart attacks, and the database

550
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:15,920
 is called "sweet heart."

551
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:18,920
 That is sweet.

552
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:22,520
 It is something that ruins lives.

553
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:25,400
 Do we know what they think it is due to, is it due to Christmas arguments?

554
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:29,000
 It is due to arguments, stress, did I get the right present?

555
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:35,240
 I have all the family here, we have uncles and aunties and children who do not usually hang

556
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:37,480
 in one room necessarily or when they do.

557
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:41,160
 You say it is due to, obviously we do not know why it is, but we are speculating that

558
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:42,160
 it is because of that.

559
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:44,280
 It was not like they interviewed everyone mid heart attack and said, "What is it that you

560
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:45,280
 think is caused this?"

561
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:48,000
 And they said, "Well, my wife is being a real bitch in the kitchen."

562
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,000
 Yeah, yeah.

563
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:53,480
 People thought it was the cold quite a lot, but then they did a similar study in the Southern

564
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:56,680
 hemisphere and found quite similar results, I think, didn't they?

565
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:57,680
 Yeah.

566
00:26:57,680 --> 00:27:00,200
 I think it is monopoly.

567
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:01,840
 Have you seen this about monopoly this year?

568
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:04,680
 They have released the longest ever game of monopoly.

569
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:05,680
 Really?

570
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:06,680
 Yeah.

571
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:07,680
 Because they are always doing new additions.

572
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:14,320
 Yeah, so the newest addition, they have 66 properties that you can get instead of 28.

573
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:18,640
 There are 40 extra spaces, but you only have one dice, so it takes you way longer to get

574
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:20,120
 between each one.

575
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:25,480
 And the game carries on until one player has absolutely everything on the board.

576
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:29,960
 So you keep going into more and more and more debt, and basically you just keep going forever

577
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:31,800
 until one person wins all the money.

578
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:32,800
 That is good, isn't it?

579
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:37,960
 Because that is what I have always said about monopoly is that it is just over too fast.

580
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:41,200
 Actually, in 2016, Hasbro ran, they are very good at PR stuff.

581
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:46,480
 They ran a monopoly helpline from the 24th to the 26th of December to stop literally because

582
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:50,840
 they said, people always argue while playing this dreadful board game of ours.

583
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:51,840
 Yeah.

584
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:56,320
 And the idea was the person at the end of the hotline wouldn't solve this sort of like family

585
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:57,320
 dynamic argument.

586
00:27:57,320 --> 00:28:02,160
 It would be, I will tell you what the official rule that you were disputing, because that is

587
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:04,960
 the main thing that, so there would be people.

588
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:10,360
 So people in the list of why people would call would be or why the arguments happen.

589
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:11,360
 Free parking.

590
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:14,440
 No one really knows officially what the rules are, and that would be a big thing that they

591
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:16,320
 would argue about.

592
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:20,160
 And then it would be stuff like people taking too long to take their turn, someone buying

593
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:23,420
 a property that you want when they definitely didn't need it.

594
00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:24,920
 On the top of the list, it was people being--

595
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:25,920
 That's allowed.

596
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:26,920
 I know it's allowed.

597
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:27,920
 That's the best part of the game.

598
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:28,920
 Exactly.

599
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:35,240
 Well, this is why your attitude is causing, and yeah, the top being people being too cocky

600
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:36,240
 when winning.

601
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:41,720
 So this is just a helpline of people who can't be asked to read the instructions, which

602
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:44,400
 are all of four pages long, is that what we're saying?

603
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:45,400
 Yes.

604
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:46,400
 Right.

605
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:47,400
 Just checking.

606
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:48,400
 Who this was targeting.

607
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:51,000
 There are theories about why people argue-- it's not an actual psychological theory, it's

608
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,640
 about why people argue over Christmas.

609
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:57,000
 And one theory that I really like is that there are things which are social allergens.

610
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:03,720
 So you're not allergic the first time someone makes a time some joke to you over Christmas.

611
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:07,160
 But by the fourth or fifth time, you're having a very much stronger reaction, even if it's

612
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:10,240
 someone completely different, making that joke again.

613
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:11,240
 I don't know.

614
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:12,240
 Don't talk too loud.

615
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:13,240
 Everyone will want one.

616
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:21,520
 Oh, so there was a study done recently, which asked people their main reasons for post-Christmas

617
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:22,520
 grumpiness.

618
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:25,320
 So people get very depressed in January.

619
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:31,040
 It's sort of kind of depressing things, like suicides go off on New Year's days, the biggest

620
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:32,040
 day for suicide.

621
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:34,640
 But happily Christmas days, the smallest day for suicide.

622
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,120
 So people hang on.

623
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:39,400
 But people get upset in January.

624
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:40,400
 And--

625
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:41,400
 Can I just apologise for my fact?

626
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:44,560
 I've never--

627
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:46,160
 Probably if I did this to us, don't I?

628
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:47,320
 It's a depressing fact.

629
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:51,800
 No, the main reason people get upset after Christmas, apparently, is because, hey, there

630
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:53,040
 were a list of 20.

631
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:57,320
 One of them was, our house is full of Christmas presents, and I don't want most of them.

632
00:29:57,320 --> 00:30:02,000
 Which, extremely ungrateful, apparently, children become a complete nightmare because they

633
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:06,240
 get used to the indulgence of Christmas, which I don't know if that's true, but they become

634
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:13,360
 terrorists, basically, and then people cite it chocolate withdrawal symptoms.

635
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:15,480
 That's not real.

636
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:21,360
 Top 20, why I'm grumpy in January, medical chocolate withdrawal.

637
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:26,240
 One bad thing that, in the olden days, would happen just after Christmas, in the 1600s in

638
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:30,960
 Wales, they had a tradition where you would beat up the last person to get out of bed on

639
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:38,200
 Boxing Day.

640
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:40,920
 And is that why it's Boxing Day?

641
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:43,920
 No.

642
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:48,920
 They would also, around the same time, they would throw food at the wall on Christmas Day,

643
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:52,120
 and whenever it's spelled out on the wall, that's who you would marry.

644
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:59,200
 What, I mean, did they have alphabetsis spaghetti in 16th century Wales?

645
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:00,200
 What?

646
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:02,120
 Can you help to spell out?

647
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:06,280
 I suppose if they're trifle, they'll go, "Urgh!"

648
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:07,720
 Yeah, you're right.

649
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:12,800
 I suppose maybe, like, spaghetti, they probably don't have spaghetti in those days, did they?

650
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:13,800
 Wow.

651
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:15,320
 Have you guys heard the song?

652
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:16,320
 An eel.

653
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:19,840
 They would get an eel from the table and throw that at them.

654
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:22,000
 Again, their name of bed have again with S.

655
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,840
 Oh.

656
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:29,760
 Have you guys heard of this song from 2004 called the 12 STIs of Christmas?

657
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:30,920
 No.

658
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:37,560
 This was a song written by the Department of Health as part of a public safety campaign,

659
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:41,480
 and it was to teach people, especially young people, about the risks of unsafe sex.

660
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:42,480
 And it started.

661
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:46,360
 It had all the verses, so it started on the first day of Christmas.

662
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:49,880
 My true love gave to me a bug that made it hard to pee.

663
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:53,760
 OK, so that's right, but they kept mixing up the verses all the way along.

664
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:58,280
 So I just want to share a verse nine with you on the ninth day of Christmas.

665
00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:03,360
 My true love gave to me, genital waltz, tricombone, he asks his helper, tightest pubic,

666
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:07,520
 lies gonorrhea.

667
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:14,240
 Genital herpes syphilis, glermidia, and soles that spread a-na-lea.

668
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:19,360
 That's real.

669
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:21,120
 That's an official thing.

670
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:25,680
 I reckon no one has ever stood on this stage and sung the word gonorrhea quite as beautifully

671
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:27,240
 as you did.

672
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:32,560
 There was a study in 2016, and it was a Christmas study, so it was quite light-hearted in its

673
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:33,560
 intent.

674
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:37,320
 But it's had recent estimates show Santa has to travel 510 million kilometres at nearly

675
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:42,040
 the speed of light each night before Christmas, while controlling the estimated 5.6 million

676
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:48,040
 reindeer necessary to pull his 2.3 million tons sleigh.

677
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:52,920
 Considering one fatality in commercial aviation about every three 23 billion passenger kilometres,

678
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:58,040
 and assuming that Santa's lay is not considerably safer than a standard aeroplane, Santa would

679
00:32:58,040 --> 00:33:05,280
 die on duty every 45 years.

680
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:07,440
 When's the next one due, do we know?

681
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:11,400
 Well, statistically he should have died four times since his first appearance in the 18th

682
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:13,440
 century, but he keeps on surviving.

683
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:14,440
 He's fine.

684
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:15,440
 He's okay.

685
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:16,440
 Yeah.

686
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:22,320
 They looked at some injuries in America between 2007 and 2016 over Christmas.

687
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:28,160
 These are just injuries, but 36,000 people just over died from, sorry, got injured from electrical

688
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:35,640
 decorations, 80,000 got injured from other types of decorations, 17,928 got injured from artificial

689
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:45,240
 trees, and 277 children were hurt during interactions with a Santa impersonator.

690
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:49,360
 And apparently, according to the researchers, their examples they gave is by either falling

691
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:53,440
 off his lap or falling while running away in fear.

692
00:33:53,440 --> 00:34:00,920
 Oh, we need to move on to our final fact of the show, and that is James.

693
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:08,480
 Okay, my fat this week is that Mariah Carey has three Christmas trees, one of which is decorated

694
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:11,080
 with pictures of herself.

695
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:18,960
 Okay, so this is the modern day Santa Claus, Mariah Carey, and she has a main 19-foot

696
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:20,880
 tree in her living room.

697
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:24,840
 She has a smaller one in her bedroom, and she has one in the family room area that they

698
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:27,080
 call the Charlie Brown tree.

699
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:32,040
 And it's a really cute, kind of slightly, scraggly looking one, but they put polarise of the

700
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:36,080
 family as well, not just her, so it's a nice, it's a nice thing.

701
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:40,040
 And she has told us all about what happens at her Christmas.

702
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:45,920
 She always takes a plane to Aspen in Colorado, and she comes off the plane and she gets onto

703
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:51,160
 a sleigh pulled by reindeer while they play all I want for Christmas is you again and again

704
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:52,160
 and again.

705
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:55,640
 Yeah, and she absolutely loves that.

706
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:58,320
 Actually, she does really like her own music.

707
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:00,960
 She likes to do stuff with her own music.

708
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:06,000
 According to her ex-husband Nick Chanan, when she gave birth, as the babies came out, they

709
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:11,040
 were playing a Mariah Carey song, and they didn't just want any old Mariah Carey song.

710
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:16,120
 They wanted a live version of Mariah Carey's singing fantasy in Madison Square Garden,

711
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:19,880
 so that when the babies came out, they came out to a round of applause.

712
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:24,640
 Wow, she is the absolute moby dick of pop divas.

713
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:27,280
 She is just, yeah, the perfect.

714
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:31,560
 Wait, is the monkey one decorated with pictures of her?

715
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:32,560
 Yes.

716
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:34,160
 It's just like, like I say, Charlie Brown.

717
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:37,120
 It's kind of a more traditionally, kind of a small one.

718
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:38,120
 Okay.

719
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:39,120
 Yeah.

720
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:40,120
 I think it's quite sweet, actually.

721
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:47,480
 Yeah, the thing is, Mariah Carey, I think we need a few people who exist in that diva land

722
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:52,200
 that we just celebrate as opposed to going there crazy, because it's so amazing to know

723
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:54,960
 that there's someone out there just living this insane life.

724
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:58,200
 And all these rumours, we don't know which ones are true, and which ones are false.

725
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:01,160
 So the things like people say, she never wears a watch.

726
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:02,760
 She can whistle with her hands.

727
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:03,760
 She never wears a watch.

728
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:05,520
 She's not diva behaviour.

729
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:08,800
 I mean, you're not wearing a watch right now.

730
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:13,920
 Ooh, damn, try by the Mariah Carey of noses, I think it's a fish.

731
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:19,120
 She has supposedly an extreme aversion to overhead lighting, and has, as she claims,

732
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:21,560
 that elevator lighting is toxic.

733
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:25,800
 And the thing is, some people sometimes pick her up on the fact that she has these big

734
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:27,920
 rumours about her and ask her about it.

735
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:32,080
 And often the answer is crazier than the actual accusation.

736
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:35,800
 She was interviewed by someone who said, there's a rumour going around that you only bathe

737
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:38,520
 in bottled water, sort of sparkling water.

738
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:40,240
 She said, that is insane.

739
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:44,040
 I bathe in milk.

740
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:47,640
 I don't think that was actually with Mariah Carey, though, that interview, because this was

741
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:53,400
 in the Guardian, and the description is so bizarre, but basically, he's sort of led into

742
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:55,840
 this room where he says, it's dimly lit, and he can barely make her out.

743
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:59,600
 And she's sitting in a weird throne, and then she asked to be moved to a different chair,

744
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:00,840
 slash throne, doesn't she?

745
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:04,400
 And there's this sort of air throughout that all he can see is her glittering diamonds

746
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:08,200
 and sort of the red of her outfit in this weird dimly lit space.

747
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:12,320
 And I think she's just sending stand-ins around the world to repeat mad stuff about her.

748
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:14,920
 But there are clues that it might have been her.

749
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:18,800
 She wasn't wearing a watch for instance.

750
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:22,200
 She whistled to beckon him.

751
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:27,680
 So this song, all I want for Christmas is you, is, I think it's just over 25 years old.

752
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:28,680
 Really?

753
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:33,120
 Yeah, it's now an oldie, and when she was told, when Mariah Carey was told that the song

754
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:35,680
 was turning 25 years old, she had an amazing response.

755
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:39,960
 She just said, I don't acknowledge time.

756
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:44,080
 That's why she doesn't wear a watch.

757
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:46,960
 She doesn't acknowledge time, because she doesn't have birthdays.

758
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:50,000
 We don't truly know when Mariah Carey was born.

759
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,880
 That's a real thing.

760
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:55,440
 She was either born, I think it was in 19...

761
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:56,440
 What are the two days?

762
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:58,040
 I think it was at 59 or 1960?

763
00:37:58,040 --> 00:37:59,040
 Yeah, exactly.

764
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:00,040
 And we don't fully know.

765
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:01,040
 Oh, I'm sorry.

766
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:02,680
 She was either born in 1969 or 1970.

767
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:04,520
 She was either born in 1969 or 1970.

768
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:07,320
 We don't fully know, because we haven't got the birth certificate to tell.

769
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:09,040
 But she doesn't have birthdays.

770
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:12,640
 She has anniversaries, because she doesn't acknowledge time.

771
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:16,000
 Well, it's still acknowledging time if it's an anniversary, isn't it?

772
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,200
 You just given it a different name.

773
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:21,200
 Good point, yeah.

774
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:22,520
 She hasn't thought this one through.

775
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:26,240
 Yeah, no, she's, I think she's a fascinating character, and the amazing thing, all I want

776
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:27,240
 for Christmas is you.

777
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:29,520
 She's expanded it into so many territories.

778
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:33,600
 There's a movie that she made recently, an animated movie, all I want for Christmas

779
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:37,320
 is you, the kids' cartoon, which I watched the other night.

780
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:38,320
 She's made...

781
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:39,320
 I'm sorry.

782
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:40,320
 You watched.

783
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:41,320
 Yeah, I saw it the other night.

784
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:42,320
 Was it good?

785
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,320
 Yes, fantastic.

786
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:44,320
 Yeah.

787
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:45,320
 Did your son enjoy it?

788
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:46,320
 He doesn't watch that shit.

789
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:47,320
 He's...

790
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:48,320
 I put it on.

791
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,320
 He was like, "I'm out."

792
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:55,040
 You went to play with his Thomas the Tank Engine toys, so I watched it on my own.

793
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:56,040
 But it's...

794
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:58,040
 That is so depressing.

795
00:38:58,040 --> 00:38:59,040
 Why?

796
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:01,320
 It's a fantastic song, a fantastic movie.

797
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:04,200
 She's a fantastic human who doesn't acknowledge that time exists.

798
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:05,200
 Like, it's...

799
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:06,200
 How long is the film?

800
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:08,200
 If time doesn't exist.

801
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:12,600
 To be fair, it did feel like forever, but by it.

802
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:17,080
 There is a whole article deconstructing the meaning of the song "All I Want for Christmas

803
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:21,000
 is You" on the Atlantic, which is really good, and it kind of does it slightly academically.

804
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:24,320
 So it says, "The author carefully sets out her premises.

805
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:28,760
 There exists an entity, I, representing conscious selfhood.

806
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:36,040
 This entity exists in relation to material space, a lot, and seasonal time for Christmas.

807
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:40,400
 The entity expresses this relationality through the vocabulary of desire or want, and though

808
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:44,920
 its desires could theoretically be expansive, they are not.

809
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:48,760
 Yet how could we understand the author's examination of Christmas as anything but an implicit

810
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:50,760
 critique of capitalism?

811
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:52,760
 Hmm.

812
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:54,280
 She doesn't want all the other stuff of Christmas.

813
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:55,280
 She just wants you.

814
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:59,400
 They've plagiarised her notes when she was writing that song, haven't they?

815
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:01,560
 Because she did write it, we should say.

816
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:04,160
 I didn't quite realise that she wrote all of her songs.

817
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:06,600
 I come in my hand when number one she's had, but it doesn't.

818
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:08,280
 She did write basically all of them.

819
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:09,560
 She co-wrote that one, I think, right?

820
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:10,560
 She co-wrote it.

821
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:15,800
 I think as a co-writer, she is unique in that she has had one number one hit for every year

822
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:18,600
 of the '90s, and no one else has had that.

823
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:19,600
 She's had...

824
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:20,600
 Yeah.

825
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:21,600
 So she's...

826
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:22,600
 Oh.

827
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:23,600
 Yeah.

828
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:25,240
 Or the very least character of them.

829
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:26,240
 And there is a theory.

830
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:29,200
 Our colleague, James Rawson, who is a big moral carry fan, he has a theory that all the

831
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:34,360
 deeper stuff is actually to distract us, and it doesn't draw attention to the fact she's

832
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:39,320
 a very good songwriter, and she has a five octave range, which is almost unheard of.

833
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:41,480
 But, you know, if she goes on about that, it might sound vain.

834
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:43,560
 So she just does the fun, deeper stuff instead.

835
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:44,560
 Yeah.

836
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:47,080
 Well, though, I don't want to suggest her career is going downhill, but last year she was

837
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:49,000
 doing the tube announcements in London.

838
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,800
 Well, should I say?

839
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:52,280
 She did the "Please mind the gap".

840
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:53,280
 Well, she did...

841
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:54,280
 She did, uh, please...

842
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:55,440
 All I want for Christmas is Houston.

843
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:56,440
 Ah!

844
00:40:56,440 --> 00:41:01,560
 Very, very strong.

845
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:04,040
 The next train will be along at some point.

846
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:05,040
 When?

847
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:06,040
 No.

848
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:07,040
 No, she did.

849
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:13,760
 She did a "Please stand clear of the yellow line", and also have you heard my new album, "Tube

850
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:14,760
 Announcement".

851
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:15,760
 Wow.

852
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:16,760
 But did she actually save the new album, though?

853
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:17,760
 She did, yeah.

854
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:18,760
 Oh, wow.

855
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:22,680
 And this year is a fight like every year for Christmas number one.

856
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:24,280
 Last year, it was won by...

857
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:30,600
 We built this city on sausage rolls, by Ladd Baby, and as a kind of comment against that,

858
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:35,280
 there is a couple called Gavin Chapel Bates and Giles Bryant, who are from Cambridge

859
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:40,080
 and Suffolk respectively, and they've recorded a single called "Peace on Your Plate", which

860
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:43,680
 is the world's first vegan Christmas single.

861
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:49,000
 The lyrics include "Children are playing by the fireside, there's magic at your tide, but

862
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:55,200
 in a different land, it's a different scene in a factory shed, the animal's scream".

863
00:41:55,200 --> 00:42:01,600
 That honestly makes your fact, Dan, look like it's a wonderful life.

864
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:08,240
 I think it's on vertical at the first vegan Christmas song, when I think a lot of other

865
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:14,280
 Christmas songs haven't been rampantly carnivorous.

866
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:16,680
 Do you know who invented Christmas songs?

867
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:17,680
 Christmas carols.

868
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:21,440
 Oh, it can't have been named after someone called Carol.

869
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:23,200
 I wish it was...

870
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:28,900
 No, it was a guy called Edward White Benson, who was the Bishop of Truro in the 19th century,

871
00:42:28,900 --> 00:42:29,900
 late 19th century.

872
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:34,000
 And basically, carols were sung in pubs, and he wanted to move them to churches.

873
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:37,740
 And he went on to be an Archbishop of Canterbury, he was quite a big deal, but he had this

874
00:42:37,740 --> 00:42:40,380
 extraordinary family life, so he was married.

875
00:42:40,380 --> 00:42:47,000
 His wife had, she kept a diary of her lovers, she had 39 lesbian lovers, so she was gay, she

876
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,140
 kept the diary, she had this.

877
00:42:48,140 --> 00:42:53,100
 They had six children, four of whom were gay, and two, so there are two sons, one went on

878
00:42:53,100 --> 00:42:57,500
 to be a famous poet, the other went on to be a famous novelist, one of their two daughters

879
00:42:57,500 --> 00:43:03,260
 who was gay stole her mother's girlfriend, and he was there being the Archbishop of Canterbury,

880
00:43:03,260 --> 00:43:04,260
 just...

881
00:43:04,260 --> 00:43:05,260
 Wow.

882
00:43:05,260 --> 00:43:09,100
 And then the mother, she was called Mary Benson, and Gladstone, at the time, called Prime Minister,

883
00:43:09,100 --> 00:43:14,220
 called her the cleverest woman in England, which, you know, she had 39 lovers, that's pretty

884
00:43:14,220 --> 00:43:15,220
 smart.

885
00:43:15,220 --> 00:43:21,300
 Yeah, but not when they count all those STDs she got that in.

886
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:24,020
 We're going to have to wrap up very shortly.

887
00:43:24,020 --> 00:43:25,740
 Anything before we do?

888
00:43:25,740 --> 00:43:27,580
 Just some more Christmas songs.

889
00:43:27,580 --> 00:43:28,580
 Yeah, yeah.

890
00:43:28,580 --> 00:43:33,300
 So, for instance, the song "I Saw Mummy Kissing Santa Claus" was condemned by the Roman

891
00:43:33,300 --> 00:43:39,740
 Catholic Church in Boston, because they said it was showing adultery because mummy is kissing

892
00:43:39,740 --> 00:43:41,060
 another man.

893
00:43:41,060 --> 00:43:44,700
 And it was only when the guy who sang the song to me by met with the church leaders to

894
00:43:44,700 --> 00:43:49,660
 explain that actually in this song, the part of Santa is being played by the father in

895
00:43:49,660 --> 00:43:51,700
 this.

896
00:43:51,700 --> 00:43:54,220
 And then they lifted their condemnation.

897
00:43:54,220 --> 00:43:58,980
 I think it makes sense to release Christmas songs.

898
00:43:58,980 --> 00:44:04,740
 So, I was looking at the royalties that you get in 2016, Channel 5 did a review of all

899
00:44:04,740 --> 00:44:07,060
 the biggest songs that gets the "Numor and Royalties."

900
00:44:07,060 --> 00:44:09,660
 So, she came in at number three.

901
00:44:09,660 --> 00:44:10,660
 What do you think?

902
00:44:10,660 --> 00:44:11,660
 Number two and number one.

903
00:44:11,660 --> 00:44:12,660
 Are they Christmas songs?

904
00:44:12,660 --> 00:44:13,660
 Christmas songs.

905
00:44:13,660 --> 00:44:14,900
 I think it'll be Slades, Merry Christmas, everybody.

906
00:44:14,900 --> 00:44:15,900
 Number one.

907
00:44:15,900 --> 00:44:16,900
 Yeah.

908
00:44:16,900 --> 00:44:17,900
 Yeah.

909
00:44:17,900 --> 00:44:18,900
 How cool is that?

910
00:44:18,900 --> 00:44:24,660
 And according to this report, they get 1 million pounds in royalties a year from that

911
00:44:24,660 --> 00:44:25,660
 alone.

912
00:44:25,660 --> 00:44:26,660
 Slade.

913
00:44:26,660 --> 00:44:28,660
 Not all of them wrote it though.

914
00:44:28,660 --> 00:44:31,140
 It's only naughty holder and maybe one of the blues.

915
00:44:31,140 --> 00:44:32,140
 Yeah.

916
00:44:32,140 --> 00:44:33,140
 So, probably naughty is getting mostly.

917
00:44:33,140 --> 00:44:36,020
 They get, they get up between them and the other bandmates get nothing.

918
00:44:36,020 --> 00:44:37,020
 Yeah.

919
00:44:37,020 --> 00:44:38,020
 Yeah.

920
00:44:38,020 --> 00:44:39,020
 No.

921
00:44:39,020 --> 00:44:40,020
 Yeah.

922
00:44:40,020 --> 00:44:41,020
 Way.

923
00:44:41,020 --> 00:44:42,020
 I didn't even say no way.

924
00:44:42,020 --> 00:44:43,020
 I just said no.

925
00:44:43,020 --> 00:44:48,500
 But here's the thing, you don't even need to have written a good song that people have heard

926
00:44:48,500 --> 00:44:49,500
 about.

927
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:52,500
 In 1978, there was a guy called Randy Brooks who wrote a song called "Gramma got

928
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:55,340
 run over by a reindeer."

929
00:44:55,340 --> 00:44:57,580
 It's called 40 million copies.

930
00:44:57,580 --> 00:45:00,380
 It's been covered three times.

931
00:45:00,380 --> 00:45:03,060
 The family have just been pulling in royalties each year.

932
00:45:03,060 --> 00:45:04,060
 Yeah.

933
00:45:04,060 --> 00:45:05,060
 Wow.

934
00:45:05,060 --> 00:45:06,060
 Why have we not heard of this?

935
00:45:06,060 --> 00:45:07,060
 Has anyone heard of that?

936
00:45:07,060 --> 00:45:08,060
 Oh.

937
00:45:08,060 --> 00:45:09,060
 Oh, really?

938
00:45:09,060 --> 00:45:10,060
 It's a famous song.

939
00:45:10,060 --> 00:45:11,060
 Famous song?

940
00:45:11,060 --> 00:45:12,060
 We just don't know anything.

941
00:45:12,060 --> 00:45:15,660
 There is a, there is a phone called "Mood Media" which provides tunes to shops.

942
00:45:15,660 --> 00:45:20,980
 So, you know, 300,000 American shops have this music provided by this one firm.

943
00:45:20,980 --> 00:45:25,100
 And they have 30 different Christmas music channels.

944
00:45:25,100 --> 00:45:29,900
 That's how many different kinds of mood shopkeepers might want to evoke in their shops.

945
00:45:29,900 --> 00:45:30,900
 What?

946
00:45:30,900 --> 00:45:36,060
 So, if you run a small Christian bookshop, you might not want to have the raunchy Lady Gaga

947
00:45:36,060 --> 00:45:37,060
 Christmas songs.

948
00:45:37,060 --> 00:45:38,060
 Oh, yeah.

949
00:45:38,060 --> 00:45:39,060
 Okay.

950
00:45:39,060 --> 00:45:42,500
 But if you're selling, if you've got a cool shop for young people, then you might want to

951
00:45:42,500 --> 00:45:46,380
 play a song called "Christmas in Harlem" by someone called Kanye West.

952
00:45:46,380 --> 00:45:47,380
 Yeah.

953
00:45:47,380 --> 00:45:50,580
 Well, those some of the classic Christmas songs are raunchy than you might think.

954
00:45:50,580 --> 00:45:51,580
 I love them.

955
00:45:51,580 --> 00:45:55,540
 I think Christmas Carols didn't really start being sung in churches until the 19th century

956
00:45:55,540 --> 00:45:57,620
 when they had to rewrite lots of them.

957
00:45:57,620 --> 00:46:02,740
 But, deck the hall, the open deck, the hall with Bowser Holly, the opening line used to

958
00:46:02,740 --> 00:46:06,900
 be, "Oh, how soft my fair ones, bosom, fa-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la."

959
00:46:06,900 --> 00:46:07,900
 Wow.

960
00:46:07,900 --> 00:46:08,900
 Did it really?

961
00:46:08,900 --> 00:46:12,420
 Yeah, it was a Welsh song about how fit someone's girlfriend was.

962
00:46:12,420 --> 00:46:13,420
 Of course.

963
00:46:13,420 --> 00:46:14,420
 Oh, come.

964
00:46:14,420 --> 00:46:15,420
 Are you faithful?

965
00:46:15,420 --> 00:46:19,420
 Have you tried their lair to us?

966
00:46:19,420 --> 00:46:20,420
 Yeah.

967
00:46:20,420 --> 00:46:25,220
 I just, you know, that song, "Oh, come on, you're faithful."

968
00:46:25,220 --> 00:46:32,500
 If you sing that, you're technically pleading for the French to invade England.

969
00:46:32,500 --> 00:46:34,300
 And because...

970
00:46:34,300 --> 00:46:37,340
 At this stage, why not try it?

971
00:46:37,340 --> 00:46:39,340
 Like...

972
00:46:39,340 --> 00:46:45,180
 That feels like the big reset button that we need to hit at this point.

973
00:46:45,180 --> 00:46:47,180
 Oh.

974
00:46:47,180 --> 00:46:51,940
 Yeah, it was written by John Francis Wade, who was an English Catholic, and he fled the country

975
00:46:51,940 --> 00:46:55,460
 during the 1745 rebellion, and he wrote this song.

976
00:46:55,460 --> 00:47:01,300
 And it was basically, "Oh, come the Catholics to England and save us from the Protestants."

977
00:47:01,300 --> 00:47:06,900
 That's weird, because he must have screwed up the lyrics, "Come, ye, oh, come, ye to Bert Esleyhem."

978
00:47:06,900 --> 00:47:07,900
 Unless...

979
00:47:07,900 --> 00:47:12,740
 Well, he was talking about the Bethlehem in Wales.

980
00:47:12,740 --> 00:47:14,580
 Okay, that is it.

981
00:47:14,580 --> 00:47:15,820
 That is all of our facts.

982
00:47:15,820 --> 00:47:17,620
