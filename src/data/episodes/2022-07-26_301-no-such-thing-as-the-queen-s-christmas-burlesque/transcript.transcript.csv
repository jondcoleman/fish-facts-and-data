00:00:00,00:00:06,How's he been? Who James?
00:00:06,00:00:07,Father Christmas.
00:00:07,00:00:08,Has he been where?
00:00:08,00:00:11,"To your house to give you presents, because it's Christmas Day!"
00:00:11,00:00:13,It is Christmas Day!
00:00:13,00:00:14,Yes!
00:00:14,00:00:19,"He has, he went down the chimney of my laptop to deliver me a new episode of No Such Thing As A Fish."
00:00:19,00:00:20,Amazing.
00:00:20,00:00:21,Yes!
00:00:21,00:00:26,What we have got for you today a little bit earlier than scheduled is our Christmas special recorded
00:00:26,00:00:30,live in the most Christmasy of places Birmingham!
00:00:30,00:00:32,"Oh, it was so Christmassy."
00:00:32,00:00:33,It was so Christmassy.
00:00:33,00:00:37,"There was stuff outside, there were lights, there were German sausages."
00:00:37,00:00:38,So many German sausages.
00:00:38,00:00:40,It was like flippy lapland.
00:00:40,00:00:41,It was.
00:00:41,00:00:42,It was Christmas.
00:00:42,00:00:43,It was Christmas City.
00:00:43,00:00:46,It was such a fun episode to do.
00:00:46,00:00:49,"We enjoyed ourselves, like we always do in Birmingham."
00:00:49,00:00:52,"It's one of the best places that we go and visit, really, really hope you enjoy it."
00:00:52,00:00:56,It's full of Christmassy facts that you can tell all of your family over the Christmas
00:00:56,00:00:57,table.
00:00:57,00:00:58,Over the Christmas table?
00:00:58,00:00:59,Over it.
00:00:59,00:01:00,Over the Christmas table.
00:01:00,00:01:03,Get over that table and tell them our facts.
00:01:03,00:01:06,"Well, hey, this has been successful."
00:01:06,00:01:08,Enjoy your day.
00:01:08,00:01:09,That's the main thing.
00:01:09,00:01:11,"Yeah, the main thing is that you have a really good day."
00:01:11,00:01:12,Enjoy your Christmas.
00:01:12,00:01:17,"Hope you got lots of amazing presents, and here is an extra rarely episode of No Such Thing"
00:01:17,00:01:18,As A Fish.
00:01:18,00:01:19,"Oh, ho, ho, ho."
00:01:19,00:01:20,Such Thing As A Fish.
00:01:20,00:01:21,Sure.
00:01:21,00:01:28,"Okay, on with the podcast."
00:01:28,00:01:31,"On with the son of God, cast not like."
00:01:31,00:01:36,"On with the son of God, cast not like."
00:01:36,00:01:59,"Hello, and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing As A Fish, a weekly podcast this"
00:01:59,00:02:04,week coming to you live from Birmingham!
00:02:04,00:02:13,"My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here with Anna Chazinski, Andrew Hunter Murray and"
00:02:13,00:02:17,"James Harkin, and once again, we have gathered around the microphones this time with our four"
00:02:17,00:02:25,"favorite Christmas facts from the last seven days, and in no particular order, here we go."
00:02:25,00:02:32,"Starting with you, Andy, my fact is that in 1958, the Queen's speech was lost on the"
00:02:32,00:02:38,"day of delivery, and then found by a nearby poodle."
00:02:38,00:02:41,It's a heartwarming Christmas story for the ages.
00:02:41,00:02:44,"Oh, though what it says to me is that the cogs are really shit at fundamentally."
00:02:44,00:02:47,"Yeah, that's true."
00:02:47,00:02:52,"This was in 1958, so obviously she hadn't been done many of these speeches before, pretty"
00:02:52,00:02:56,"nerve-wracking, still live delivery, and one of the most important copies of the speech,"
00:02:56,00:03:01,"one with all the producers' notes on it, was lost, and then found by a poodle."
00:03:01,00:03:03,So what was the poodle doing there?
00:03:03,00:03:06,I thought security was quite tight around the Queen.
00:03:06,00:03:10,"I think it was not by the Queen, so if it, I mean she would have found it, if it would have"
00:03:10,00:03:11,been next to her.
00:03:11,00:03:13,"But surely, it must have been near the Queen."
00:03:13,00:03:15,"I think it was at a nearby train station, was it?"
00:03:15,00:03:16,What?
00:03:16,00:03:19,So this poodle has no involvement in the story.
00:03:19,00:03:21,"Well, no, he's the main protagonist in the story."
00:03:21,00:03:23,I don't know if you heard the story.
00:03:23,00:03:26,"Sorry, no, so what I mean is it's not like the poodle was in Buckingham Palace going"
00:03:26,00:03:32,"to have lost script, I'm on it. No, no, no, no, no, they didn't summon it in to find the script."
00:03:32,00:03:33,And did they?
00:03:33,00:03:38,"No, no, no, they didn't summon it in to find, Jesus."
00:03:38,00:03:43,"You don't say I've lost a script somewhere in the United Kingdom, I need one poodle."
00:03:43,00:03:47,"The poodle at a train station noticed a bag, there was a bag, and the poodle went over"
00:03:47,00:03:48,and explored it.
00:03:48,00:03:50,"I can't remember the name of the poodle, I don't think I wrote it down."
00:03:50,00:03:53,How did he know it was the Queen's speech?
00:03:53,00:04:02,"Well, he did a sort of series of mimes to his master."
00:04:02,00:04:05,"The owner of the poodle was a guy called John Harvey, who then took it to the police."
00:04:05,00:04:09,"The Queen's speech was saved, and things just carried on."
00:04:09,00:04:10,That's normal.
00:04:10,00:04:11,Right.
00:04:11,00:04:14,"Thank God, because where would we have been without that speech?"
00:04:14,00:04:15,"Right, right."
00:04:15,00:04:18,"Everyone remembers the 1958, right?"
00:04:18,00:04:23,"I remember the 1959 speech, and when I say I remember, I'm not that old, but I can tell"
00:04:23,00:04:28,"you about the 1959 speech, because it was the first speech that had a joke in it, as far"
00:04:28,00:04:33,"as I can see, because I read through the early ones, and this one, the Queen said, she explained"
00:04:33,00:04:37,"all the places they were going, all these new countries in the Commonwealth, and she"
00:04:37,00:04:40,"said, ""So between us, we are going to many parts of the world."
00:04:40,00:04:43,"We have no plans for space travel at the moment."""
00:04:43,00:04:48,"I mean, I'm not saying there was a great joke."
00:04:48,00:04:52,"It passes our bar for jokes, but I'm not sure it passes many people's."
00:04:52,00:04:54,There was a good one in 1957.
00:04:54,00:05:00,"I mean, like, classic in 1957, I would say, again, it was still live, and the Queen was doing"
00:05:00,00:05:01,her speech.
00:05:01,00:05:07,"And mid-speech, there was interference in the signal for the speech itself on TV."
00:05:07,00:05:12,"So while people were watching, suddenly they could hear American police officers coming"
00:05:12,00:05:17,"over in place of the Queen speaking, and the line that was heard most by most people was,"
00:05:17,00:05:20,"""Jo, I'm going to go grab a quick coffee."""
00:05:20,00:05:25,That was suddenly just in the middle of the Queen's speech in 1957.
00:05:25,00:05:28,"Some of them, they put them out on telly, but there was no picture."
00:05:28,00:05:33,"Yeah, I think between 1952 and 1957, they realised they had television now, and so they brought"
00:05:33,00:05:38,"us on TV, but she didn't have a makeup done or something, so the first TV broadcast was"
00:05:38,00:05:42,"in 1957, wasn't it, where you could actually see her, but before that, you could just listen"
00:05:42,00:05:45,"to her, but watching a black TV screen."
00:05:45,00:05:46,Wow.
00:05:46,00:05:47,"Well, we're in it."
00:05:47,00:05:50,So people might not have really known much about the Queen what she looked like and stuff
00:05:50,00:05:51,like that.
00:05:51,00:05:55,"So when they heard someone saying, ""Jo, I'm going to get a coffee,"" did they maybe think it"
00:05:55,00:05:57,was the Queen doing that?
00:05:57,00:05:58,Yeah.
00:05:58,00:06:03,I think from all the money they knew what she looked like.
00:06:03,00:06:08,Yeah.
00:06:08,00:06:10,"Okay, here's a challenge for you."
00:06:10,00:06:14,Can you guys guess one thing that she never does while she is recording the speech?
00:06:14,00:06:15,Perlesque.
00:06:15,00:06:17,That's fair.
00:06:17,00:06:20,That's technically the correct answer.
00:06:20,00:06:21,It's a correct answer.
00:06:21,00:06:24,I've never seen her stuffing a turkey.
00:06:24,00:06:25,Yes.
00:06:25,00:06:26,And you've got to re-frame the question.
00:06:26,00:06:28,I think I've got for a long time.
00:06:28,00:06:30,She never takes a wee.
00:06:30,00:06:31,She never stands on her head.
00:06:31,00:06:36,She doesn't smile in a genuine way.
00:06:36,00:06:38,She does her kind of queen smile.
00:06:38,00:06:43,"She doesn't do this sort of big, friendly smile."
00:06:43,00:06:45,She has a kind of controlled smile.
00:06:45,00:06:47,She's got a queen smile.
00:06:47,00:06:48,That's cool.
00:06:48,00:06:49,"Yeah, but there is."
00:06:49,00:06:52,"There was a time where the soundman decided, ""Oh, she's got such a nice smile."
00:06:52,00:06:55,"I'm going to see if I can make a smile during a thing."""
00:06:55,00:06:59,"So he attached a sign saying, ""Smile to the camera boom arm."""
00:06:59,00:07:07,"And he put a sprig of holly and some tinsel next to it, and she saw it and she immediately frowned."
00:07:07,00:07:12,"And he was less victim of capital punishment to this country, I'll say."
00:07:12,00:07:17,"I discovered while reading about the Queen's Christmas Broadcast set, she is a podcast pioneer."
00:07:17,00:07:18,Is she?
00:07:18,00:07:19,Yeah.
00:07:19,00:07:23,The Queen's speech was released as a podcast in 2006.
00:07:23,00:07:24,Wow.
00:07:24,00:07:25,Wow.
00:07:25,00:07:26,We started in 2014.
00:07:26,00:07:28,"Like, that's how distant it is."
00:07:28,00:07:34,"And I haven't heard it, but I assume it's the same as the speech, but yeah, it's not very long."
00:07:34,00:07:35,It'd be very long.
00:07:35,00:07:39,"You know, she could have done a podcast slant once Father wrote a pardo."
00:07:39,00:07:41,That's why it's not...
00:07:41,00:07:42,Queen's speech.
00:07:42,00:07:43,Stop the Queen's speech.
00:07:43,00:07:44,Hello.
00:07:44,00:07:46,We're sponsored this week.
00:07:46,00:07:47,Right.
00:07:47,00:07:48,The Royal Mint.
00:07:48,00:07:50,My all of you.
00:07:50,00:07:51,"Of course, before the Queen's speech was the Queen's speech."
00:07:51,00:07:52,It was the King's speech.
00:07:52,00:08:00,"All right, so it started."
00:08:00,00:08:05,"I think the first one was 1932, although it only became a yearly thing in '39."
00:08:05,00:08:10,"And 1932, actually, so John Rhys, who was general manager of the BBC at the time, had been"
00:08:10,00:08:14,trying to persuade King George V to do a King's speech for years.
00:08:14,00:08:15,And he really didn't want to.
00:08:15,00:08:20,"He was sweetly shy and nervous and thought he wasn't a very good speaker and was a technophobe,"
00:08:20,00:08:23,so didn't really understand this new fangled radio thing.
00:08:23,00:08:27,And he finally was persuaded to do it when it turned out that Roger Kipling was going to
00:08:27,00:08:29,"write it for him and then he thought, ""Okay, well that sounds good."""
00:08:29,00:08:30,He wrote it for him.
00:08:30,00:08:32,"Yeah, he wrote the speech for him."
00:08:32,00:08:33,Jungle Book guy.
00:08:33,00:08:37,"Yeah, Jungle Book guy as some people know him better."
00:08:37,00:08:38,What a speech.
00:08:38,00:08:40,The bare necessities.
00:08:40,00:08:42,The simple.
00:08:42,00:08:45,"No, it wasn't."
00:08:45,00:08:47,He wrote some other stuff as well.
00:08:47,00:08:48,"Okay, cool."
00:08:48,00:08:49,"Yeah, so it was one of those other things."
00:08:49,00:08:55,"Apparently, King George, from his naval days, I read, felt most comfortable in small rooms."
00:08:55,00:09:00,"And so he, even though they made a fake recording studio, which was one of the grand rooms in"
00:09:00,00:09:05,"the palace, he actually recorded it in a box room under the stairs at Sandringham House."
00:09:05,00:09:07,"And yeah, it was Harry Potter."
00:09:07,00:09:10,"It was like Harry Potter, yeah."
00:09:10,00:09:11,His hand was shaking.
00:09:11,00:09:14,"If you listen to it, you can hear the paper rustling because his hand was shaking so much."
00:09:14,00:09:15,Wow.
00:09:15,00:09:16,And he said it ruined his Christmas.
00:09:16,00:09:17,Oh.
00:09:17,00:09:22,"Guess who produced the, can you, see, I've got another Christmas challenge for you."
00:09:22,00:09:23,Yeah.
00:09:23,00:09:27,See if you can guess who produced the messages between 1986 and 1991.
00:09:27,00:09:29,Was it Dieter Von Tees?
00:09:29,00:09:30,"Oh, yeah."
00:09:30,00:09:34,I wish I hadn't got you that book about Burlesque.
00:09:34,00:09:39,"No, it was not Dieter Von Tees."
00:09:39,00:09:41,So a BBC producer.
00:09:41,00:09:43,"Yeah, but also a friend of the Queen's."
00:09:43,00:09:44,Friend of the Queen's.
00:09:44,00:09:45,"Oh, Prince Charles."
00:09:45,00:09:46,David Attenborough.
00:09:46,00:09:47,David Attenborough.
00:09:47,00:09:48,Yeah.
00:09:48,00:09:49,Great fact.
00:09:49,00:09:53,"It's just not his normal thing, is it, you know?"
00:09:53,00:09:57,"But he was, was he the guy, he was quite a famous producer before he did his other service."
00:09:57,00:09:58,"He was in the '60s, yeah."
00:09:58,00:10:03,"Is he the guy who, I might get this wrong, but is he the guy who decided to put Snooker"
00:10:03,00:10:05,on television to sell Colour TV's?
00:10:05,00:10:06,Yes.
00:10:06,00:10:07,Yes.
00:10:07,00:10:11,"It was when he was a control of BBC One, I think, when he said to sell Colour TV."
00:10:11,00:10:15,"Can I say, that's just a tiny bit worse than me saying, is that the Jungle Book guy to"
00:10:15,00:10:19,say David Attenborough is either Snooker guy?
00:10:19,00:10:25,"Well, coming from you, the Queen, is that the woman off the money?"
00:10:25,00:10:29,"Oh, why do we always argue at Christmas?"
00:10:29,00:10:32,Some more stuff about TV and movies around Christmas.
00:10:32,00:10:33,"Oh, yeah."
00:10:33,00:10:34,Something like that.
00:10:34,00:10:38,"So there were four Flintstones Christmas specials, which, how exactly, they celebrate"
00:10:38,00:10:39,Christ's birth?
00:10:39,00:10:40,I don't really know.
00:10:40,00:10:41,"Oh, yeah."
00:10:41,00:10:42,"Oh, yeah."
00:10:42,00:10:43,They were pioneers.
00:10:43,00:10:51,"And there was a, there is a YouTuber called Jake Roper, and he decided to look at that classic"
00:10:51,00:10:57,"Christmas movie Home Alone, and he found out that he looks at all the tricks that Kevin"
00:10:57,00:11:01,played on the burglars and found out what would happen in real life.
00:11:01,00:11:05,"So apparently, shame on me, I haven't seen this movie, but I believe this is what happened."
00:11:05,00:11:06,Wow.
00:11:06,00:11:07,I know.
00:11:07,00:11:12,"James, that's a better fact than whatever you're about to tell us."
00:11:12,00:11:18,"So apparently, at one stage, he heats up a door knob, and they burn their hand."
00:11:18,00:11:22,"And apparently, the temperatures needed to transfer enough heat to the outside knob would"
00:11:22,00:11:26,have melted the door or set the house on fire.
00:11:26,00:11:30,"But there is a crowbar that goes to the chest of one of the burglars, but that would have"
00:11:30,00:11:33,punctured his lungs and his heart.
00:11:33,00:11:36,"But it wouldn't matter, because Kevin would have already murdered both of them with the"
00:11:36,00:11:43,paint can trap. Apparently the force of those paint cans would have killed both of them.
00:11:43,00:11:44,That would be a very different movie.
00:11:44,00:11:45,What do you mean?
00:11:45,00:11:46,Yes.
00:11:46,00:11:47,How do you know?
00:11:47,00:11:48,You don't know.
00:11:48,00:11:49,I'm assuming.
00:11:49,00:11:50,Maybe they both die.
00:11:50,00:11:51,It is weird.
00:11:51,00:11:54,It's like watching you read a foreign language where you don't understand it.
00:11:54,00:11:58,"You obviously don't quite know what, what this is in reference to at all."
00:11:58,00:12:00,"Look, I read the synopsis on Wikipedia."
00:12:00,00:12:04,Do you know there's such a weird thing about Home Alone?
00:12:04,00:12:09,"So Joe Pesci, who was the bad guy who's not an idiot, he obviously was more used to doing"
00:12:09,00:12:10,kind of gangster films.
00:12:10,00:12:12,He's in quite a lot of serious gangster films.
00:12:12,00:12:15,"And I think he might have thought this was a similar thing, so we went really method in"
00:12:15,00:12:16,Home Alone.
00:12:16,00:12:21,"So on the set of Home Alone, he refused to see Macauley Culkin at all, because he wanted"
00:12:21,00:12:24,"Macauley to be really, really terrified of him."
00:12:24,00:12:27,"So you know, he didn't want to kill the magic of him being this bad guy."
00:12:27,00:12:31,"And in the scene where which you may remember, and I do remember, and James doesn't remember"
00:12:31,00:12:37,"where he's hung up on a coat hook at one point, if you remember, by his coat."
00:12:37,00:12:41,"And Joe Pesci says to him, ""I'm going to bite all your fingers off one at a time."""
00:12:41,00:12:46,"And in one of the rehearsals, he actually bit Culkin really, really hard and drew blood,"
00:12:46,00:12:47,and he still has a scar.
00:12:47,00:12:48,Really?
00:12:48,00:12:49,Yeah.
00:12:49,00:12:53,"Apparently, this little nine-year-old boy had to do a screaming fit and be like, ""I don't"
00:12:53,00:12:56,"care how many Oscars you've got, don't go around biting nine-year-olds."""
00:12:56,00:12:57,Ah.
00:12:57,00:13:03,"That's apparently an ET when they were filming it, Steven Spielberg needed Drew Barrymore"
00:13:03,00:13:06,"to cry during a scene, there's a scene where she really solbs."
00:13:06,00:13:10,"And behind the scenes of it is that apparently before the take was done, Steven Spielberg leaned"
00:13:10,00:13:13,"into her going, ""It's going to be a good scene."
00:13:13,00:13:14,"You know, you'll be great."
00:13:14,00:13:15,"You'll be great."""
00:13:15,00:13:17,"By the way, your dog just died."
00:13:17,00:13:21,"And then walked back, and she burst out crying, and that's her genuinely crying."
00:13:21,00:13:22,Wow.
00:13:22,00:13:24,"Anyway, Merry Christmas."
00:13:24,00:13:30,We need to move on to our next fact.
00:13:30,00:13:33,"Time for fact number two, and that is Chazinski."
00:13:33,00:13:39,"My fact this week is that as well as being the birthplace of Jesus, Bethlehem is also where"
00:13:39,00:13:43,we found the oldest known depiction of people having sex.
00:13:43,00:13:44,Yeah.
00:13:44,00:13:52,"Of which is very, that's very ironic, because famously, that was a sex-free zone."
00:13:52,00:13:53,"Oh, yeah."
00:13:53,00:13:54,Yeah.
00:13:54,00:14:00,"As a sex-free zone, it was just they had two people of many people had sex, right?"
00:14:00,00:14:01,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:14:01,00:14:03,But it is related to non-sex.
00:14:03,00:14:07,"They, Mary and Joseph, didn't have access to this piece of art, otherwise they would have"
00:14:07,00:14:08,known what to do.
00:14:08,00:14:10,But they didn't have instructions.
00:14:10,00:14:11,Yeah.
00:14:11,00:14:13,"So, yeah, I think this is such a weird coincidence."
00:14:13,00:14:16,This is a really quite a beautiful piece of art.
00:14:16,00:14:17,It's made of calcite.
00:14:17,00:14:22,"It's from 11,000 years ago, so it's a stone-aged piece of art, and it's kind of this couple"
00:14:22,00:14:27,"of Androgenous humans sort of, I don't know how sex works when they're that Androgenous,"
00:14:27,00:14:32,"but sort of intertwined, like legs over each other, look it up, it's very nice."
00:14:32,00:14:43,"Face to face, so the traditional way, and it, sure, sure, you could specify, but not missionary"
00:14:43,00:14:44,I would say.
00:14:44,00:14:48,"Well, when you look at it, it's quite hard to tell if it was meant to be upright or horizontal."
00:14:48,00:14:53,So that's sort of in the eye of the beholder.
00:14:53,00:14:54,Anyway.
00:14:54,00:14:58,I'm really looking forward to your BBC 4 documentary on the history of art.
00:14:58,00:15:03,"So this, it is, when I first looked at it, I thought it just looked like a rock."
00:15:03,00:15:04,Okay.
00:15:04,00:15:07,"Maybe I'm just not into my art, as much as other is."
00:15:07,00:15:08,It doesn't look like a rock.
00:15:08,00:15:10,It looks like two people gloriously intertwined.
00:15:10,00:15:11,Sure.
00:15:11,00:15:12,Okay.
00:15:12,00:15:16,"But according to artist Mark Quinn, depending on the perspective and how you look at it,"
00:15:16,00:15:23,"it also resembles a penis, breasts, or a vagina, depending on which way you kind of move"
00:15:23,00:15:24,it around.
00:15:24,00:15:25,So it's like a bit of trick art.
00:15:25,00:15:26,"Oh, cool."
00:15:26,00:15:30,"It is, it is very cool that that, because if you put it, if you put it sort of sideways onto"
00:15:30,00:15:34,"you, so it says widest, it looks like the couple, one next to each other, and then if you move"
00:15:34,00:15:37,"it so it's sort of end on, it looks like a penis."
00:15:37,00:15:39,"And then on the base, there's a cheeky vagina."
00:15:39,00:15:42,"So it's a very, it is amazing."
00:15:42,00:15:43,A cheeky vagina.
00:15:43,00:15:45,"It's a dream for the price of one, isn't it?"
00:15:45,00:15:46,"Yeah, it is."
00:15:46,00:15:51,"So basically your pawn hub of 10,000 years ago, because you could just search for any of"
00:15:51,00:15:54,"three things, and then you would get it."
00:15:54,00:16:00,"Anyway, so it was found in the 1930s by some Bedouin Shepherd boys, and obviously it's now"
00:16:00,00:16:02,in the British Museum.
00:16:02,00:16:06,It's quite nice that it was Shepherd.
00:16:06,00:16:07,That's cool.
00:16:07,00:16:08,Isn't it?
00:16:08,00:16:09,Just watching the flock.
00:16:09,00:16:10,Right.
00:16:10,00:16:11,Yeah.
00:16:11,00:16:16,The Deppers looked at their horny rock by night.
00:16:16,00:16:17,Is that a star in this guy?
00:16:17,00:16:18,Doesn't matter.
00:16:18,00:16:21,Keep looking at the rock.
00:16:21,00:16:22,We have no evidence.
00:16:22,00:16:25,They got any kind of arousal out of it.
00:16:25,00:16:27,"They just, they found it, and then they gave it to an archaeologist."
00:16:27,00:16:31,"It's in an area just sort of within a few miles of Bethem, called Ain Sacri, and it's in"
00:16:31,00:16:33,a cave.
00:16:33,00:16:39,"And yeah, made by the Natufians, who were, they're called a sedentary people, which isn't as"
00:16:39,00:16:40,insulting as it sounds.
00:16:40,00:16:45,"It just means that they were not nomadic, very unusually for that time."
00:16:45,00:16:46,They weren't nomadic.
00:16:46,00:16:49,I think they're my favourite group of people from history than the Deppers.
00:16:49,00:16:50,Really?
00:16:50,00:16:54,"Yeah, because the first example we have of anyone who domesticated the dog, they're the"
00:16:54,00:16:56,first examples we have of a big feast.
00:16:56,00:16:59,They were the first example we have of beer.
00:16:59,00:17:02,It might be just people are looking in that place and so on and so on.
00:17:02,00:17:06,But I think they sound like a really cool bunch of people.
00:17:06,00:17:14,"The first known beer, I think, is 13,000 years BP, which is not a petrol reference."
00:17:14,00:17:17,"But so I didn't know about this phrase, but it sounds for before present."
00:17:17,00:17:21,And I don't know why we need it when we have BC.
00:17:21,00:17:25,"But so it's 13,000 years BP, so I guess about 11,000 years BC."
00:17:25,00:17:30,"And when do you think before present, it sort of starts from, as in this?"
00:17:30,00:17:32,"Well, just when you said it a few seconds ago."
00:17:32,00:17:33,But not anymore.
00:17:33,00:17:34,Now it's now.
00:17:34,00:17:35,And so forth.
00:17:35,00:17:36,Is it not that?
00:17:36,00:17:39,I'm going to have to say your first answer.
00:17:39,00:17:40,And it's not.
00:17:40,00:17:41,It's 1950.
00:17:41,00:17:43,"OK, boomer."
00:17:43,00:17:51,It's not when archaeologists just decided the present is 1950.
00:17:51,00:17:52,That is so strange.
00:17:52,00:17:53,It's really weird.
00:17:53,00:17:57,It's because some people think it's like where there was atomic bombs.
00:17:57,00:17:58,It's exactly that.
00:17:58,00:17:59,It's that because of it.
00:17:59,00:18:03,"And so then any rocks from then on have some kind of radioactivity, so you can't use carbon"
00:18:03,00:18:04,dating as well.
00:18:04,00:18:09,"Everything's kind of screwed up after 1950 because of all the nuclear shit, as you say."
00:18:09,00:18:12,There's a theory that it's the other Bethlehem.
00:18:12,00:18:18,But it's the Bethlehem that we have where there is a church and a cave and all the tourism
00:18:18,00:18:19,and religion.
00:18:19,00:18:20,Why do you know the Bethlehem?
00:18:20,00:18:21,"There's one in Wales, for instance."
00:18:21,00:18:22,It's not that one.
00:18:22,00:18:23,I know there's one in Pennsylvania.
00:18:23,00:18:24,It's not that one.
00:18:24,00:18:26,There's one in the Galilee.
00:18:26,00:18:29,And an Israeli archaeologist has said that although there probably won't be any proof
00:18:29,00:18:34,"due to modern building work, a lot of Jesus' life happened near the other"
00:18:34,00:18:39,"Galilee or near the Galilee, and also that one is only a few hours of a walk from Nazareth,"
00:18:39,00:18:43,which is where Mary and Joseph traditionally came from.
00:18:43,00:18:47,"So it's more reasonable that a pregnant, heavily pregnant woman would have walked for a few"
00:18:47,00:18:48,hours.
00:18:48,00:18:52,But did they say that they spent like weeks in the desert walking from one place to the
00:18:52,00:18:53,other?
00:18:53,00:18:55,They must have got really lost if it's this one right now.
00:18:55,00:18:56,That's true.
00:18:56,00:18:57,"That's the thing they did, though."
00:18:57,00:18:58,That's the weird thing.
00:18:58,00:19:04,"So the Nativity, the birth of Jesus is only mentioned in two of the Gospels anyway, Luke and Matthew,"
00:19:04,00:19:06,and it's only in Luke that they make the journey.
00:19:06,00:19:08,"So Matthew, they're already living in Bethlehem."
00:19:08,00:19:12,"And even in Matthew, this is the extent of the whole journey that we have, the impression"
00:19:12,00:19:14,of the donkey and the long trip.
00:19:14,00:19:18,"He just says, ""You know it was for a census, so they both confirmed that they were going"
00:19:18,00:19:21,to Bethlehem for a census and they sort of happened to have a child while they were
00:19:21,00:19:22,there.
00:19:22,00:19:26,"But when Joseph went to be registered with Mary, he was expecting a child."
00:19:26,00:19:29,"While they were there, she gave birth and wrapped him in bounds of cloth and laid him in a"
00:19:29,00:19:32,"manger because there was no place for him in the inn."""
00:19:32,00:19:33,And that's it.
00:19:33,00:19:34,That's all we have.
00:19:34,00:19:37,"And all the other stuff is from later the donkey, the long journey, the cave, it all comes"
00:19:37,00:19:39,from the proto-gospel of James.
00:19:39,00:19:42,"Wait, you didn't say the cave, did you?"
00:19:42,00:19:43,The cave.
00:19:43,00:19:44,"Oh, the cave, sorry."
00:19:44,00:19:45,Yeah.
00:19:45,00:19:48,They cracked open a cave and had a whale of a time.
00:19:48,00:19:53,Traditional English Christmases used to have a mint pie in the shape of a manger and
00:19:53,00:20:01,"you would put a little Christ child doll in the pie, based on the pie, on the pie, which"
00:20:01,00:20:04,"was sort of shaped like a manger, like kind of trough."
00:20:04,00:20:07,And then you would put the Christ child in it and then at dinner time you would eat the
00:20:07,00:20:08,pie.
00:20:08,00:20:09,"So sorry, did you eat the Jesus?"
00:20:09,00:20:10,"No, you didn't eat the Jesus."
00:20:10,00:20:13,"The Jesus, I think, was an annual decoration to be done every year."
00:20:13,00:20:14,Yes.
00:20:14,00:20:16,"The pie was just, the pie was the edible bit."
00:20:16,00:20:17,See.
00:20:17,00:20:18,She's complaining to the waiter.
00:20:18,00:20:22,"Wait a waiter, there's a Jesus in my pie."
00:20:22,00:20:25,What comes next?
00:20:25,00:20:26,Is there an ending to that joke?
00:20:26,00:20:27,Are you joking?
00:20:27,00:20:28,With the fly.
00:20:28,00:20:29,"Yeah, you are."
00:20:29,00:20:30,"No, no."
00:20:30,00:20:31,What's the end to the fly joke?
00:20:31,00:20:32,"Oh, my God."
00:20:32,00:20:33,Should we sit together?
00:20:33,00:20:35,There's a fly in my soup.
00:20:35,00:20:36,Don't you?
00:20:36,00:20:37,Don't you?
00:20:37,00:20:38,Don't you?
00:20:38,00:20:39,Don't you?
00:20:39,00:20:40,Don't you?
00:20:40,00:20:41,Don't you?
00:20:41,00:20:42,Everyone will want one.
00:20:42,00:20:43,That's dated.
00:20:43,00:20:46,It's the way we told it.
00:20:46,00:20:49,Do you guys know where the animals come from and the nativity?
00:20:49,00:20:53,"You know where you usually have an ox and a kind of a duck in it, so they're not mentioned"
00:20:53,00:20:54,in the Bible either.
00:20:54,00:21:00,"They're not mentioned in the Bible, but they come from the gospel of pseudo Matthew, who"
00:21:00,00:21:04,appeared in the eighth century and claimed he should have remembered all this stuff.
00:21:04,00:21:08,"No, so pseudo Matthew wrote the gospel, which is where we get a lot of onitivity ideas."
00:21:08,00:21:14,"And he introduced the stable where Jesus was born and adds an ox and an ass, but he also"
00:21:14,00:21:18,"added to the scene lions, leopards and dragons."
00:21:18,00:21:19,No.
00:21:19,00:21:20,That's so cool.
00:21:20,00:21:21,"Yeah, that's correct."
00:21:21,00:21:25,"If you want to do the nativity properly, if you're having an ox, you might as well have a lion,"
00:21:25,00:21:26,a leopard and a dragon.
00:21:26,00:21:29,He said they were all wagging their tails to show their devotion.
00:21:29,00:21:33,Have we spoken about nativity thefts?
00:21:33,00:21:35,I can't remember if we've ever talked about it before.
00:21:35,00:21:37,Are people stealing nativity scenes?
00:21:37,00:21:38,"Yeah, it is."
00:21:38,00:21:43,"And so there's been a huge rash of this in lots of places in the last few years, so there"
00:21:43,00:21:50,"is another Bethlehem in Pennsylvania, and there a woman stole the crib in 2016 and broke"
00:21:50,00:21:51,a bit.
00:21:51,00:21:54,The chief of police had to glue baby Jesus' leg back on.
00:21:54,00:21:56,It was very embarrassing.
00:21:56,00:22:01,So they had to put a security camera solely on the baby Jesus when they reinstalled it.
00:22:01,00:22:02,But this keeps happening.
00:22:02,00:22:08,"So there's a place in Wisconsin called West Bend where 2017 Jesus was stolen, then they"
00:22:08,00:22:09,found it.
00:22:09,00:22:10,They replaced the Jesus.
00:22:10,00:22:14,"And Chris was Eve, it was stolen again, the baby Jesus."
00:22:14,00:22:18,And there was a police officer who saw a woman suspiciously cradling something.
00:22:18,00:22:22,I don't know how you do that.
00:22:22,00:22:24,"And it was the replacement baby Jesus, they put back in."
00:22:24,00:22:25,"And the officer yelled, ""Belie, stop."""
00:22:25,00:22:28,And she dropped the Jesus and pegged it.
00:22:28,00:22:32,"So now in West Bend, everything is bolted, literally everything is bolted down."
00:22:32,00:22:36,The baby Jesus is plastered to the manger.
00:22:36,00:22:40,And there is a camera which has hunting technology where when someone leans in for a
00:22:40,00:22:46,"closer look, a motion-activated trail camera kicks in and starts recording their every move."
00:22:46,00:22:49,We need to move on in a sec to our next fact.
00:22:49,00:22:51,We could talk about some erotic art.
00:22:51,00:22:52,"Oh, okay, yeah."
00:22:52,00:22:53,"Oh, sure."
00:22:53,00:22:59,"Well, I just wanted to quickly mention another very old piece of art, which is all the statues"
00:22:59,00:23:03,"of this Egyptian god called Min, who I didn't know existed, but he was a god of fertility."
00:23:03,00:23:08,And you see little sculptures of him from around the fourth millennium BC.
00:23:08,00:23:13,"So bloody long time ago, and he has a very close association with lettuce, and that is because"
00:23:13,00:23:19,"so he's, oh, if you look at him, he's always seen standing with a very erect, very long penis,"
00:23:19,00:23:22,"which he's cradling in his left hand, I think."
00:23:22,00:23:24,"And then he's associated with lettuce, which was…"
00:23:24,00:23:25,Suspiciously cradling.
00:23:25,00:23:30,That's how you always suspiciously cradle something.
00:23:30,00:23:32,"If it's a penis, it is always suspicious."
00:23:32,00:23:35,"I don't know how she was cradling the baby Jesus though, is it?"
00:23:35,00:23:36,"No, no, it was not."
00:23:36,00:23:37,I'm sure.
00:23:37,00:23:41,"But, yeah, he was the god of fertility and associated with lettuce, and it was thought the lettuce"
00:23:41,00:23:45,"was the most aphrodisiacal food stuff, because it looks like a penis."
00:23:45,00:23:50,"But also, if you break a leaf off a lettuce, it oozes kind of white substance, and so this"
00:23:50,00:23:51,was really revered.
00:23:51,00:23:54,"Sorry, I must say that these are old lettuces that you would get in ancient Egypt."
00:23:54,00:24:00,"If you go to St. Brees and get an iceberg, what it doesn't look like a penis, and to it"
00:24:00,00:24:01,doesn't ooze white liquid.
00:24:01,00:24:02,It looks a tiny bit.
00:24:02,00:24:07,"Is that remain long, romaine, long phallic thing, but yeah, it looks less like a penis and"
00:24:07,00:24:08,doesn't do the oozing?
00:24:08,00:24:11,"Waiter, waiter, there's a penis in my lettuce."
00:24:11,00:24:15,That one actually doesn't have an ending.
00:24:15,00:24:17,"Sorry, can I say one last thing about nativity?"
00:24:17,00:24:18,Sorry.
00:24:18,00:24:20,It's just there was a nativity set available on Amazon.
00:24:20,00:24:25,"I've read a lot of reviews of nativity sets that you can buy for yourself, and there is"
00:24:25,00:24:32,"one set that is available on Amazon for £3.69, so this is a very, you know, cost."
00:24:32,00:24:33,Reasonably priced.
00:24:33,00:24:37,"Reasonably priced, nativity set, and the main review for it says this, bearing in mind"
00:24:37,00:24:42,"the price, I did not expect a work of art, but I did hope for something tasteful."
00:24:42,00:24:45,The three figurines were tatty and badly painted.
00:24:45,00:24:49,Joseph had white paint splattered all over his cloak and down his staff.
00:24:49,00:24:51,"The bit, the bit, no, stop."
00:24:51,00:24:55,Are you sure that wasn't lettuce juice?
00:24:55,00:24:59,"It gets, like this nativity gets worse, the beard on the right side of his face was higher"
00:24:59,00:25:03,than the left and covered his whole nose.
00:25:03,00:25:05,Mary's paintwork was even tattier.
00:25:05,00:25:08,She has two left hands.
00:25:08,00:25:13,Baby Jesus has a right eye that is twice the size of his left eye and his mouth is on the
00:25:13,00:25:16,right side of his face.
00:25:16,00:25:17,So it is an optimist thing.
00:25:17,00:25:20,And there was no dragon.
00:25:20,00:25:24,"Oh, we need to move on to our next fact."
00:25:24,00:25:28,"Okay, it is time for fact number three, and that is my fact."
00:25:28,00:25:33,My fact this week is the most likely time in the year to have a heart attack is during
00:25:33,00:25:37,a family Christmas gathering.
00:25:37,00:25:38,This is absolutely true.
00:25:38,00:25:40,This was research that was done in Sweden.
00:25:40,00:25:43,"They looked at data of 283,000 heart attacks."
00:25:43,00:25:49,"It took place in the country between 1998 and 2013, and they found that at 10pm on December"
00:25:49,00:25:55,"the 24th, which is when the Swedes celebrate, that is when the Christmas gatherings happen,"
00:25:55,00:26:00,"that is when it was most likely to happen, 37% more likely to happen on Christmas Eve,"
00:26:00,00:26:04,then say 20% on New Year's Day or any other period of the year.
00:26:04,00:26:05,That is really good.
00:26:05,00:26:13,"They got this information from a database they have of 283,000 heart attacks, and the database"
00:26:13,00:26:15,"is called ""sweet heart."""
00:26:15,00:26:18,That is sweet.
00:26:18,00:26:22,It is something that ruins lives.
00:26:22,00:26:25,"Do we know what they think it is due to, is it due to Christmas arguments?"
00:26:25,00:26:29,"It is due to arguments, stress, did I get the right present?"
00:26:29,00:26:35,"I have all the family here, we have uncles and aunties and children who do not usually hang"
00:26:35,00:26:37,in one room necessarily or when they do.
00:26:37,00:26:41,"You say it is due to, obviously we do not know why it is, but we are speculating that"
00:26:41,00:26:42,it is because of that.
00:26:42,00:26:44,"It was not like they interviewed everyone mid heart attack and said, ""What is it that you"
00:26:44,00:26:45,"think is caused this?"""
00:26:45,00:26:48,"And they said, ""Well, my wife is being a real bitch in the kitchen."""
00:26:48,00:26:49,"Yeah, yeah."
00:26:49,00:26:53,"People thought it was the cold quite a lot, but then they did a similar study in the Southern"
00:26:53,00:26:56,"hemisphere and found quite similar results, I think, didn't they?"
00:26:56,00:26:57,Yeah.
00:26:57,00:27:00,I think it is monopoly.
00:27:00,00:27:01,Have you seen this about monopoly this year?
00:27:01,00:27:04,They have released the longest ever game of monopoly.
00:27:04,00:27:05,Really?
00:27:05,00:27:06,Yeah.
00:27:06,00:27:07,Because they are always doing new additions.
00:27:07,00:27:14,"Yeah, so the newest addition, they have 66 properties that you can get instead of 28."
00:27:14,00:27:18,"There are 40 extra spaces, but you only have one dice, so it takes you way longer to get"
00:27:18,00:27:20,between each one.
00:27:20,00:27:25,And the game carries on until one player has absolutely everything on the board.
00:27:25,00:27:29,"So you keep going into more and more and more debt, and basically you just keep going forever"
00:27:29,00:27:31,until one person wins all the money.
00:27:31,00:27:32,"That is good, isn't it?"
00:27:32,00:27:37,Because that is what I have always said about monopoly is that it is just over too fast.
00:27:37,00:27:41,"Actually, in 2016, Hasbro ran, they are very good at PR stuff."
00:27:41,00:27:46,They ran a monopoly helpline from the 24th to the 26th of December to stop literally because
00:27:46,00:27:50,"they said, people always argue while playing this dreadful board game of ours."
00:27:50,00:27:51,Yeah.
00:27:51,00:27:56,And the idea was the person at the end of the hotline wouldn't solve this sort of like family
00:27:56,00:27:57,dynamic argument.
00:27:57,00:28:02,"It would be, I will tell you what the official rule that you were disputing, because that is"
00:28:02,00:28:04,"the main thing that, so there would be people."
00:28:04,00:28:10,So people in the list of why people would call would be or why the arguments happen.
00:28:10,00:28:11,Free parking.
00:28:11,00:28:14,"No one really knows officially what the rules are, and that would be a big thing that they"
00:28:14,00:28:16,would argue about.
00:28:16,00:28:20,"And then it would be stuff like people taking too long to take their turn, someone buying"
00:28:20,00:28:23,a property that you want when they definitely didn't need it.
00:28:23,00:28:24,"On the top of the list, it was people being--"
00:28:24,00:28:25,That's allowed.
00:28:25,00:28:26,I know it's allowed.
00:28:26,00:28:27,That's the best part of the game.
00:28:27,00:28:28,Exactly.
00:28:28,00:28:35,"Well, this is why your attitude is causing, and yeah, the top being people being too cocky"
00:28:35,00:28:36,when winning.
00:28:36,00:28:41,"So this is just a helpline of people who can't be asked to read the instructions, which"
00:28:41,00:28:44,"are all of four pages long, is that what we're saying?"
00:28:44,00:28:45,Yes.
00:28:45,00:28:46,Right.
00:28:46,00:28:47,Just checking.
00:28:47,00:28:48,Who this was targeting.
00:28:48,00:28:51,"There are theories about why people argue-- it's not an actual psychological theory, it's"
00:28:51,00:28:52,about why people argue over Christmas.
00:28:52,00:28:57,And one theory that I really like is that there are things which are social allergens.
00:28:57,00:29:03,So you're not allergic the first time someone makes a time some joke to you over Christmas.
00:29:03,00:29:07,"But by the fourth or fifth time, you're having a very much stronger reaction, even if it's"
00:29:07,00:29:10,"someone completely different, making that joke again."
00:29:10,00:29:11,I don't know.
00:29:11,00:29:12,Don't talk too loud.
00:29:12,00:29:13,Everyone will want one.
00:29:13,00:29:21,"Oh, so there was a study done recently, which asked people their main reasons for post-Christmas"
00:29:21,00:29:22,grumpiness.
00:29:22,00:29:25,So people get very depressed in January.
00:29:25,00:29:31,"It's sort of kind of depressing things, like suicides go off on New Year's days, the biggest"
00:29:31,00:29:32,day for suicide.
00:29:32,00:29:34,"But happily Christmas days, the smallest day for suicide."
00:29:34,00:29:36,So people hang on.
00:29:36,00:29:39,But people get upset in January.
00:29:39,00:29:40,And--
00:29:40,00:29:41,Can I just apologise for my fact?
00:29:41,00:29:44,I've never--
00:29:44,00:29:46,"Probably if I did this to us, don't I?"
00:29:46,00:29:47,It's a depressing fact.
00:29:47,00:29:51,"No, the main reason people get upset after Christmas, apparently, is because, hey, there"
00:29:51,00:29:53,were a list of 20.
00:29:53,00:29:57,"One of them was, our house is full of Christmas presents, and I don't want most of them."
00:29:57,00:30:02,"Which, extremely ungrateful, apparently, children become a complete nightmare because they"
00:30:02,00:30:06,"get used to the indulgence of Christmas, which I don't know if that's true, but they become"
00:30:06,00:30:13,"terrorists, basically, and then people cite it chocolate withdrawal symptoms."
00:30:13,00:30:15,That's not real.
00:30:15,00:30:21,"Top 20, why I'm grumpy in January, medical chocolate withdrawal."
00:30:21,00:30:26,"One bad thing that, in the olden days, would happen just after Christmas, in the 1600s in"
00:30:26,00:30:30,"Wales, they had a tradition where you would beat up the last person to get out of bed on"
00:30:30,00:30:38,Boxing Day.
00:30:38,00:30:40,And is that why it's Boxing Day?
00:30:40,00:30:43,No.
00:30:43,00:30:48,"They would also, around the same time, they would throw food at the wall on Christmas Day,"
00:30:48,00:30:52,"and whenever it's spelled out on the wall, that's who you would marry."
00:30:52,00:30:59,"What, I mean, did they have alphabetsis spaghetti in 16th century Wales?"
00:30:59,00:31:00,What?
00:31:00,00:31:02,Can you help to spell out?
00:31:02,00:31:06,"I suppose if they're trifle, they'll go, ""Urgh!"""
00:31:06,00:31:07,"Yeah, you're right."
00:31:07,00:31:12,"I suppose maybe, like, spaghetti, they probably don't have spaghetti in those days, did they?"
00:31:12,00:31:13,Wow.
00:31:13,00:31:15,Have you guys heard the song?
00:31:15,00:31:16,An eel.
00:31:16,00:31:19,They would get an eel from the table and throw that at them.
00:31:19,00:31:22,"Again, their name of bed have again with S."
00:31:22,00:31:24,Oh.
00:31:24,00:31:29,Have you guys heard of this song from 2004 called the 12 STIs of Christmas?
00:31:29,00:31:30,No.
00:31:30,00:31:37,"This was a song written by the Department of Health as part of a public safety campaign,"
00:31:37,00:31:41,"and it was to teach people, especially young people, about the risks of unsafe sex."
00:31:41,00:31:42,And it started.
00:31:42,00:31:46,"It had all the verses, so it started on the first day of Christmas."
00:31:46,00:31:49,My true love gave to me a bug that made it hard to pee.
00:31:49,00:31:53,"OK, so that's right, but they kept mixing up the verses all the way along."
00:31:53,00:31:58,So I just want to share a verse nine with you on the ninth day of Christmas.
00:31:58,00:32:03,"My true love gave to me, genital waltz, tricombone, he asks his helper, tightest pubic,"
00:32:03,00:32:07,lies gonorrhea.
00:32:07,00:32:14,"Genital herpes syphilis, glermidia, and soles that spread a-na-lea."
00:32:14,00:32:19,That's real.
00:32:19,00:32:21,That's an official thing.
00:32:21,00:32:25,I reckon no one has ever stood on this stage and sung the word gonorrhea quite as beautifully
00:32:25,00:32:27,as you did.
00:32:27,00:32:32,"There was a study in 2016, and it was a Christmas study, so it was quite light-hearted in its"
00:32:32,00:32:33,intent.
00:32:33,00:32:37,But it's had recent estimates show Santa has to travel 510 million kilometres at nearly
00:32:37,00:32:42,"the speed of light each night before Christmas, while controlling the estimated 5.6 million"
00:32:42,00:32:48,reindeer necessary to pull his 2.3 million tons sleigh.
00:32:48,00:32:52,"Considering one fatality in commercial aviation about every three 23 billion passenger kilometres,"
00:32:52,00:32:58,"and assuming that Santa's lay is not considerably safer than a standard aeroplane, Santa would"
00:32:58,00:33:05,die on duty every 45 years.
00:33:05,00:33:07,"When's the next one due, do we know?"
00:33:07,00:33:11,"Well, statistically he should have died four times since his first appearance in the 18th"
00:33:11,00:33:13,"century, but he keeps on surviving."
00:33:13,00:33:14,He's fine.
00:33:14,00:33:15,He's okay.
00:33:15,00:33:16,Yeah.
00:33:16,00:33:22,They looked at some injuries in America between 2007 and 2016 over Christmas.
00:33:22,00:33:28,"These are just injuries, but 36,000 people just over died from, sorry, got injured from electrical"
00:33:28,00:33:35,"decorations, 80,000 got injured from other types of decorations, 17,928 got injured from artificial"
00:33:35,00:33:45,"trees, and 277 children were hurt during interactions with a Santa impersonator."
00:33:45,00:33:49,"And apparently, according to the researchers, their examples they gave is by either falling"
00:33:49,00:33:53,off his lap or falling while running away in fear.
00:33:53,00:34:00,"Oh, we need to move on to our final fact of the show, and that is James."
00:34:00,00:34:08,"Okay, my fat this week is that Mariah Carey has three Christmas trees, one of which is decorated"
00:34:08,00:34:11,with pictures of herself.
00:34:11,00:34:18,"Okay, so this is the modern day Santa Claus, Mariah Carey, and she has a main 19-foot"
00:34:18,00:34:20,tree in her living room.
00:34:20,00:34:24,"She has a smaller one in her bedroom, and she has one in the family room area that they"
00:34:24,00:34:27,call the Charlie Brown tree.
00:34:27,00:34:32,"And it's a really cute, kind of slightly, scraggly looking one, but they put polarise of the"
00:34:32,00:34:36,"family as well, not just her, so it's a nice, it's a nice thing."
00:34:36,00:34:40,And she has told us all about what happens at her Christmas.
00:34:40,00:34:45,"She always takes a plane to Aspen in Colorado, and she comes off the plane and she gets onto"
00:34:45,00:34:51,a sleigh pulled by reindeer while they play all I want for Christmas is you again and again
00:34:51,00:34:52,and again.
00:34:52,00:34:55,"Yeah, and she absolutely loves that."
00:34:55,00:34:58,"Actually, she does really like her own music."
00:34:58,00:35:00,She likes to do stuff with her own music.
00:35:00,00:35:06,"According to her ex-husband Nick Chanan, when she gave birth, as the babies came out, they"
00:35:06,00:35:11,"were playing a Mariah Carey song, and they didn't just want any old Mariah Carey song."
00:35:11,00:35:16,"They wanted a live version of Mariah Carey's singing fantasy in Madison Square Garden,"
00:35:16,00:35:19,"so that when the babies came out, they came out to a round of applause."
00:35:19,00:35:24,"Wow, she is the absolute moby dick of pop divas."
00:35:24,00:35:27,"She is just, yeah, the perfect."
00:35:27,00:35:31,"Wait, is the monkey one decorated with pictures of her?"
00:35:31,00:35:32,Yes.
00:35:32,00:35:34,"It's just like, like I say, Charlie Brown."
00:35:34,00:35:37,"It's kind of a more traditionally, kind of a small one."
00:35:37,00:35:38,Okay.
00:35:38,00:35:39,Yeah.
00:35:39,00:35:40,"I think it's quite sweet, actually."
00:35:40,00:35:47,"Yeah, the thing is, Mariah Carey, I think we need a few people who exist in that diva land"
00:35:47,00:35:52,"that we just celebrate as opposed to going there crazy, because it's so amazing to know"
00:35:52,00:35:54,that there's someone out there just living this insane life.
00:35:54,00:35:58,"And all these rumours, we don't know which ones are true, and which ones are false."
00:35:58,00:36:01,"So the things like people say, she never wears a watch."
00:36:01,00:36:02,She can whistle with her hands.
00:36:02,00:36:03,She never wears a watch.
00:36:03,00:36:05,She's not diva behaviour.
00:36:05,00:36:08,"I mean, you're not wearing a watch right now."
00:36:08,00:36:13,"Ooh, damn, try by the Mariah Carey of noses, I think it's a fish."
00:36:13,00:36:19,"She has supposedly an extreme aversion to overhead lighting, and has, as she claims,"
00:36:19,00:36:21,that elevator lighting is toxic.
00:36:21,00:36:25,"And the thing is, some people sometimes pick her up on the fact that she has these big"
00:36:25,00:36:27,rumours about her and ask her about it.
00:36:27,00:36:32,And often the answer is crazier than the actual accusation.
00:36:32,00:36:35,"She was interviewed by someone who said, there's a rumour going around that you only bathe"
00:36:35,00:36:38,"in bottled water, sort of sparkling water."
00:36:38,00:36:40,"She said, that is insane."
00:36:40,00:36:44,I bathe in milk.
00:36:44,00:36:47,"I don't think that was actually with Mariah Carey, though, that interview, because this was"
00:36:47,00:36:53,"in the Guardian, and the description is so bizarre, but basically, he's sort of led into"
00:36:53,00:36:55,"this room where he says, it's dimly lit, and he can barely make her out."
00:36:55,00:36:59,"And she's sitting in a weird throne, and then she asked to be moved to a different chair,"
00:36:59,00:37:00,"slash throne, doesn't she?"
00:37:00,00:37:04,And there's this sort of air throughout that all he can see is her glittering diamonds
00:37:04,00:37:08,and sort of the red of her outfit in this weird dimly lit space.
00:37:08,00:37:12,And I think she's just sending stand-ins around the world to repeat mad stuff about her.
00:37:12,00:37:14,But there are clues that it might have been her.
00:37:14,00:37:18,She wasn't wearing a watch for instance.
00:37:18,00:37:22,She whistled to beckon him.
00:37:22,00:37:27,"So this song, all I want for Christmas is you, is, I think it's just over 25 years old."
00:37:27,00:37:28,Really?
00:37:28,00:37:33,"Yeah, it's now an oldie, and when she was told, when Mariah Carey was told that the song"
00:37:33,00:37:35,"was turning 25 years old, she had an amazing response."
00:37:35,00:37:39,"She just said, I don't acknowledge time."
00:37:39,00:37:44,That's why she doesn't wear a watch.
00:37:44,00:37:46,"She doesn't acknowledge time, because she doesn't have birthdays."
00:37:46,00:37:50,We don't truly know when Mariah Carey was born.
00:37:50,00:37:51,That's a real thing.
00:37:51,00:37:55,"She was either born, I think it was in 19..."
00:37:55,00:37:56,What are the two days?
00:37:56,00:37:58,I think it was at 59 or 1960?
00:37:58,00:37:59,"Yeah, exactly."
00:37:59,00:38:00,And we don't fully know.
00:38:00,00:38:01,"Oh, I'm sorry."
00:38:01,00:38:02,She was either born in 1969 or 1970.
00:38:02,00:38:04,She was either born in 1969 or 1970.
00:38:04,00:38:07,"We don't fully know, because we haven't got the birth certificate to tell."
00:38:07,00:38:09,But she doesn't have birthdays.
00:38:09,00:38:12,"She has anniversaries, because she doesn't acknowledge time."
00:38:12,00:38:16,"Well, it's still acknowledging time if it's an anniversary, isn't it?"
00:38:16,00:38:18,You just given it a different name.
00:38:18,00:38:21,"Good point, yeah."
00:38:21,00:38:22,She hasn't thought this one through.
00:38:22,00:38:26,"Yeah, no, she's, I think she's a fascinating character, and the amazing thing, all I want"
00:38:26,00:38:27,for Christmas is you.
00:38:27,00:38:29,She's expanded it into so many territories.
00:38:29,00:38:33,"There's a movie that she made recently, an animated movie, all I want for Christmas"
00:38:33,00:38:37,"is you, the kids' cartoon, which I watched the other night."
00:38:37,00:38:38,She's made...
00:38:38,00:38:39,I'm sorry.
00:38:39,00:38:40,You watched.
00:38:40,00:38:41,"Yeah, I saw it the other night."
00:38:41,00:38:42,Was it good?
00:38:42,00:38:43,"Yes, fantastic."
00:38:43,00:38:44,Yeah.
00:38:44,00:38:45,Did your son enjoy it?
00:38:45,00:38:46,He doesn't watch that shit.
00:38:46,00:38:47,He's...
00:38:47,00:38:48,I put it on.
00:38:48,00:38:49,"He was like, ""I'm out."""
00:38:49,00:38:55,"You went to play with his Thomas the Tank Engine toys, so I watched it on my own."
00:38:55,00:38:56,But it's...
00:38:56,00:38:58,That is so depressing.
00:38:58,00:38:59,Why?
00:38:59,00:39:01,"It's a fantastic song, a fantastic movie."
00:39:01,00:39:04,She's a fantastic human who doesn't acknowledge that time exists.
00:39:04,00:39:05,"Like, it's..."
00:39:05,00:39:06,How long is the film?
00:39:06,00:39:08,If time doesn't exist.
00:39:08,00:39:12,"To be fair, it did feel like forever, but by it."
00:39:12,00:39:17,"There is a whole article deconstructing the meaning of the song ""All I Want for Christmas"
00:39:17,00:39:21,"is You"" on the Atlantic, which is really good, and it kind of does it slightly academically."
00:39:21,00:39:24,"So it says, ""The author carefully sets out her premises."
00:39:24,00:39:28,"There exists an entity, I, representing conscious selfhood."
00:39:28,00:39:36,"This entity exists in relation to material space, a lot, and seasonal time for Christmas."
00:39:36,00:39:40,"The entity expresses this relationality through the vocabulary of desire or want, and though"
00:39:40,00:39:44,"its desires could theoretically be expansive, they are not."
00:39:44,00:39:48,Yet how could we understand the author's examination of Christmas as anything but an implicit
00:39:48,00:39:50,critique of capitalism?
00:39:50,00:39:52,Hmm.
00:39:52,00:39:54,She doesn't want all the other stuff of Christmas.
00:39:54,00:39:55,She just wants you.
00:39:55,00:39:59,"They've plagiarised her notes when she was writing that song, haven't they?"
00:39:59,00:40:01,"Because she did write it, we should say."
00:40:01,00:40:04,I didn't quite realise that she wrote all of her songs.
00:40:04,00:40:06,"I come in my hand when number one she's had, but it doesn't."
00:40:06,00:40:08,She did write basically all of them.
00:40:08,00:40:09,"She co-wrote that one, I think, right?"
00:40:09,00:40:10,She co-wrote it.
00:40:10,00:40:15,"I think as a co-writer, she is unique in that she has had one number one hit for every year"
00:40:15,00:40:18,"of the '90s, and no one else has had that."
00:40:18,00:40:19,She's had...
00:40:19,00:40:20,Yeah.
00:40:20,00:40:21,So she's...
00:40:21,00:40:22,Oh.
00:40:22,00:40:23,Yeah.
00:40:23,00:40:25,Or the very least character of them.
00:40:25,00:40:26,And there is a theory.
00:40:26,00:40:29,"Our colleague, James Rawson, who is a big moral carry fan, he has a theory that all the"
00:40:29,00:40:34,"deeper stuff is actually to distract us, and it doesn't draw attention to the fact she's"
00:40:34,00:40:39,"a very good songwriter, and she has a five octave range, which is almost unheard of."
00:40:39,00:40:41,"But, you know, if she goes on about that, it might sound vain."
00:40:41,00:40:43,"So she just does the fun, deeper stuff instead."
00:40:43,00:40:44,Yeah.
00:40:44,00:40:47,"Well, though, I don't want to suggest her career is going downhill, but last year she was"
00:40:47,00:40:49,doing the tube announcements in London.
00:40:49,00:40:50,"Well, should I say?"
00:40:50,00:40:52,"She did the ""Please mind the gap""."
00:40:52,00:40:53,"Well, she did..."
00:40:53,00:40:54,"She did, uh, please..."
00:40:54,00:40:55,All I want for Christmas is Houston.
00:40:55,00:40:56,Ah!
00:40:56,00:41:01,"Very, very strong."
00:41:01,00:41:04,The next train will be along at some point.
00:41:04,00:41:05,When?
00:41:05,00:41:06,No.
00:41:06,00:41:07,"No, she did."
00:41:07,00:41:13,"She did a ""Please stand clear of the yellow line"", and also have you heard my new album, ""Tube"
00:41:13,00:41:14,"Announcement""."
00:41:14,00:41:15,Wow.
00:41:15,00:41:16,"But did she actually save the new album, though?"
00:41:16,00:41:17,"She did, yeah."
00:41:17,00:41:18,"Oh, wow."
00:41:18,00:41:22,And this year is a fight like every year for Christmas number one.
00:41:22,00:41:24,"Last year, it was won by..."
00:41:24,00:41:30,"We built this city on sausage rolls, by Ladd Baby, and as a kind of comment against that,"
00:41:30,00:41:35,"there is a couple called Gavin Chapel Bates and Giles Bryant, who are from Cambridge"
00:41:35,00:41:40,"and Suffolk respectively, and they've recorded a single called ""Peace on Your Plate"", which"
00:41:40,00:41:43,is the world's first vegan Christmas single.
00:41:43,00:41:49,"The lyrics include ""Children are playing by the fireside, there's magic at your tide, but"
00:41:49,00:41:55,"in a different land, it's a different scene in a factory shed, the animal's scream""."
00:41:55,00:42:01,"That honestly makes your fact, Dan, look like it's a wonderful life."
00:42:01,00:42:08,"I think it's on vertical at the first vegan Christmas song, when I think a lot of other"
00:42:08,00:42:14,Christmas songs haven't been rampantly carnivorous.
00:42:14,00:42:16,Do you know who invented Christmas songs?
00:42:16,00:42:17,Christmas carols.
00:42:17,00:42:21,"Oh, it can't have been named after someone called Carol."
00:42:21,00:42:23,I wish it was...
00:42:23,00:42:28,"No, it was a guy called Edward White Benson, who was the Bishop of Truro in the 19th century,"
00:42:28,00:42:29,late 19th century.
00:42:29,00:42:34,"And basically, carols were sung in pubs, and he wanted to move them to churches."
00:42:34,00:42:37,"And he went on to be an Archbishop of Canterbury, he was quite a big deal, but he had this"
00:42:37,00:42:40,"extraordinary family life, so he was married."
00:42:40,00:42:47,"His wife had, she kept a diary of her lovers, she had 39 lesbian lovers, so she was gay, she"
00:42:47,00:42:48,"kept the diary, she had this."
00:42:48,00:42:53,"They had six children, four of whom were gay, and two, so there are two sons, one went on"
00:42:53,00:42:57,"to be a famous poet, the other went on to be a famous novelist, one of their two daughters"
00:42:57,00:43:03,"who was gay stole her mother's girlfriend, and he was there being the Archbishop of Canterbury,"
00:43:03,00:43:04,just...
00:43:04,00:43:05,Wow.
00:43:05,00:43:09,"And then the mother, she was called Mary Benson, and Gladstone, at the time, called Prime Minister,"
00:43:09,00:43:14,"called her the cleverest woman in England, which, you know, she had 39 lovers, that's pretty"
00:43:14,00:43:15,smart.
00:43:15,00:43:21,"Yeah, but not when they count all those STDs she got that in."
00:43:21,00:43:24,We're going to have to wrap up very shortly.
00:43:24,00:43:25,Anything before we do?
00:43:25,00:43:27,Just some more Christmas songs.
00:43:27,00:43:28,"Yeah, yeah."
00:43:28,00:43:33,"So, for instance, the song ""I Saw Mummy Kissing Santa Claus"" was condemned by the Roman"
00:43:33,00:43:39,"Catholic Church in Boston, because they said it was showing adultery because mummy is kissing"
00:43:39,00:43:41,another man.
00:43:41,00:43:44,And it was only when the guy who sang the song to me by met with the church leaders to
00:43:44,00:43:49,"explain that actually in this song, the part of Santa is being played by the father in"
00:43:49,00:43:51,this.
00:43:51,00:43:54,And then they lifted their condemnation.
00:43:54,00:43:58,I think it makes sense to release Christmas songs.
00:43:58,00:44:04,"So, I was looking at the royalties that you get in 2016, Channel 5 did a review of all"
00:44:04,00:44:07,"the biggest songs that gets the ""Numor and Royalties."""
00:44:07,00:44:09,"So, she came in at number three."
00:44:09,00:44:10,What do you think?
00:44:10,00:44:11,Number two and number one.
00:44:11,00:44:12,Are they Christmas songs?
00:44:12,00:44:13,Christmas songs.
00:44:13,00:44:14,"I think it'll be Slades, Merry Christmas, everybody."
00:44:14,00:44:15,Number one.
00:44:15,00:44:16,Yeah.
00:44:16,00:44:17,Yeah.
00:44:17,00:44:18,How cool is that?
00:44:18,00:44:24,"And according to this report, they get 1 million pounds in royalties a year from that"
00:44:24,00:44:25,alone.
00:44:25,00:44:26,Slade.
00:44:26,00:44:28,Not all of them wrote it though.
00:44:28,00:44:31,It's only naughty holder and maybe one of the blues.
00:44:31,00:44:32,Yeah.
00:44:32,00:44:33,"So, probably naughty is getting mostly."
00:44:33,00:44:36,"They get, they get up between them and the other bandmates get nothing."
00:44:36,00:44:37,Yeah.
00:44:37,00:44:38,Yeah.
00:44:38,00:44:39,No.
00:44:39,00:44:40,Yeah.
00:44:40,00:44:41,Way.
00:44:41,00:44:42,I didn't even say no way.
00:44:42,00:44:43,I just said no.
00:44:43,00:44:48,"But here's the thing, you don't even need to have written a good song that people have heard"
00:44:48,00:44:49,about.
00:44:49,00:44:52,"In 1978, there was a guy called Randy Brooks who wrote a song called ""Gramma got"
00:44:52,00:44:55,"run over by a reindeer."""
00:44:55,00:44:57,It's called 40 million copies.
00:44:57,00:45:00,It's been covered three times.
00:45:00,00:45:03,The family have just been pulling in royalties each year.
00:45:03,00:45:04,Yeah.
00:45:04,00:45:05,Wow.
00:45:05,00:45:06,Why have we not heard of this?
00:45:06,00:45:07,Has anyone heard of that?
00:45:07,00:45:08,Oh.
00:45:08,00:45:09,"Oh, really?"
00:45:09,00:45:10,It's a famous song.
00:45:10,00:45:11,Famous song?
00:45:11,00:45:12,We just don't know anything.
00:45:12,00:45:15,"There is a, there is a phone called ""Mood Media"" which provides tunes to shops."
00:45:15,00:45:20,"So, you know, 300,000 American shops have this music provided by this one firm."
00:45:20,00:45:25,And they have 30 different Christmas music channels.
00:45:25,00:45:29,That's how many different kinds of mood shopkeepers might want to evoke in their shops.
00:45:29,00:45:30,What?
00:45:30,00:45:36,"So, if you run a small Christian bookshop, you might not want to have the raunchy Lady Gaga"
00:45:36,00:45:37,Christmas songs.
00:45:37,00:45:38,"Oh, yeah."
00:45:38,00:45:39,Okay.
00:45:39,00:45:42,"But if you're selling, if you've got a cool shop for young people, then you might want to"
00:45:42,00:45:46,"play a song called ""Christmas in Harlem"" by someone called Kanye West."
00:45:46,00:45:47,Yeah.
00:45:47,00:45:50,"Well, those some of the classic Christmas songs are raunchy than you might think."
00:45:50,00:45:51,I love them.
00:45:51,00:45:55,I think Christmas Carols didn't really start being sung in churches until the 19th century
00:45:55,00:45:57,when they had to rewrite lots of them.
00:45:57,00:46:02,"But, deck the hall, the open deck, the hall with Bowser Holly, the opening line used to"
00:46:02,00:46:06,"be, ""Oh, how soft my fair ones, bosom, fa-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la."""
00:46:06,00:46:07,Wow.
00:46:07,00:46:08,Did it really?
00:46:08,00:46:12,"Yeah, it was a Welsh song about how fit someone's girlfriend was."
00:46:12,00:46:13,Of course.
00:46:13,00:46:14,"Oh, come."
00:46:14,00:46:15,Are you faithful?
00:46:15,00:46:19,Have you tried their lair to us?
00:46:19,00:46:20,Yeah.
00:46:20,00:46:25,"I just, you know, that song, ""Oh, come on, you're faithful."""
00:46:25,00:46:32,"If you sing that, you're technically pleading for the French to invade England."
00:46:32,00:46:34,And because...
00:46:34,00:46:37,"At this stage, why not try it?"
00:46:37,00:46:39,Like...
00:46:39,00:46:45,That feels like the big reset button that we need to hit at this point.
00:46:45,00:46:47,Oh.
00:46:47,00:46:51,"Yeah, it was written by John Francis Wade, who was an English Catholic, and he fled the country"
00:46:51,00:46:55,"during the 1745 rebellion, and he wrote this song."
00:46:55,00:47:01,"And it was basically, ""Oh, come the Catholics to England and save us from the Protestants."""
00:47:01,00:47:06,"That's weird, because he must have screwed up the lyrics, ""Come, ye, oh, come, ye to Bert Esleyhem."""
00:47:06,00:47:07,Unless...
00:47:07,00:47:12,"Well, he was talking about the Bethlehem in Wales."
00:47:12,00:47:14,"Okay, that is it."
00:47:14,00:47:15,That is all of our facts.
