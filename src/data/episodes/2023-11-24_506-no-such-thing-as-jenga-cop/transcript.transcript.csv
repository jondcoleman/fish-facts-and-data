00:00:00,00:00:05,"Hi everyone. Just before we started this show, we wanted to remind you of something that you"
00:00:05,00:00:11,"should already be well aware of, which is that our esteemed colleagues and co-podcasters,"
00:00:11,00:00:18,"Dan Treiber and Andrew Hunter Murray, have both written books and they are truly fantastic books."
00:00:18,00:00:24,"So, if you have anyone in your life who is a fish fan, who, God forbid, thinks that Dan and Andy"
00:00:24,00:00:30,"are the superior half of fish, perhaps that person is you, then why not get them for Christmas,"
00:00:30,00:00:37,"a book by Dan and a book by Andy. Dan has written the theory of everything else and honestly, when"
00:00:37,00:00:42,"I read it, on every page, I thought, ""How have you been hogging these facts for this book rather"
00:00:42,00:00:47,"than sharing them on the podcast?"" It is so selfish, but it's made for a brilliant book,"
00:00:47,00:00:54,stunning revelations on every page. Andy has written the last day and the sanctuary. They're
00:00:54,00:00:58,"both thrillers. They're real page turners. They're a fantastic twist and turns and of course,"
00:00:58,00:01:04,"they're making some very intelligent points about society today. So, get both of those for"
00:01:04,00:01:09,"anyone you know who's a big fan of Dan and Andy. But Anna, what if the people listening to this"
00:01:09,00:01:14,"prefer this half of the podcast, the James and Anna half of the podcast? What are those people"
00:01:14,00:01:20,"going to do? Oh, you mean the 95 other percent of our listeners. Oh, I don't know, James. Have we"
00:01:20,00:01:25,"done anything interesting lately? We have indeed. I don't know if you recall, because it was before"
00:01:25,00:01:30,"you went on maternity leave, but we wrote a book called ""Everything to Play for the QI Book of Sports"""
00:01:30,00:01:36,and it is another book that is jammed full of facts. Do you know why ancient Egyptian athletes
00:01:36,00:01:42,removed their spleens? Why pool balls no longer explode on impact? How bum slapping improves
00:01:42,00:01:48,"team performance? All that and more, you can learn in our book, which is called ""Everything to Play for"
00:01:48,00:01:56,"the QI Book of Sports"". But the truth is, if you or anyone you know is a big fish fan, these are"
00:01:56,00:02:00,the perfect things to get them for Christmas. Who doesn't love opening a present at Christmas
00:02:00,00:02:10,and getting a good old book that they can read? Read. If you too like to do this strange reading
00:02:10,00:02:16,"thing that Anna does, then go to Noticesthinkasafish.com/books and you'll be able to find all the"
00:02:16,00:02:21,"details of those three books, but they're available wherever you buy your books. Get them all, get"
00:02:21,00:02:27,them for everyone you know for Christmas. Get them now. On with the show. On with the podcast.
00:02:43,00:02:49,"Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming to you"
00:02:49,00:02:54,"from the QI offices in Hobart. My name is Dad Shriver. I am sitting here with James Harkin,"
00:02:54,00:02:59,"Andrew Hunter Murray and Anna Tyshinski. And once again, we have gathered around the microphones"
00:02:59,00:03:05,with our four favorite facts from the last seven days. And in a particular order here we go. Starting
00:03:05,00:03:12,"with fact number one, that is Anna. My fact this week is that your brain contains a tender mother,"
00:03:12,00:03:17,a tough mother and a spider mother. Is that just Dan we're talking about here?
00:03:17,00:03:24,"Yeah, and it explains everything. It does. Are these like multiple personality traits of like I"
00:03:24,00:03:28,"have a tough mother that comes, is that the idea of it? Oh, I love that idea. What would the spider"
00:03:28,00:03:32,"mother be? Well, I assume there's something that they do in the wild where they make webs. I hope"
00:03:32,00:03:36,"they like eat their children. Yeah, eating each other. The spider mother actually eats the tough"
00:03:36,00:03:39,mother and the tender mother. It's actually neither of these things. They're just fun names
00:03:39,00:03:44,for things in the brain. So these are meninges that in your brain and spinal cord. And they're
00:03:44,00:03:49,basically a three layered envelope that protects your brain and spinal cord. And there's a delicate
00:03:49,00:03:54,"inner layer, which is called the peer meter, which means sort of tender mother or soft mother"
00:03:54,00:03:59,or pious mother. And so that wraps around the brain and spinal cord a bit like cling film.
00:03:59,00:04:04,"And then there's a really tough outer layer, which is just under the bone of your skull. And that's"
00:04:04,00:04:10,"a dura mater, the hard mother, tough mother. And then there's a middle layer, the arachnoid"
00:04:10,00:04:15,mater. And that's like a network of tissues and the tissue sort of spread out like a spider's web.
00:04:15,00:04:22,"So really, it should be called a spider web mother, but it's not. The meninges is, you know,"
00:04:22,00:04:27,"a baby at the top of their head, they have like a gap where the skull hasn't covered them up. Oh,"
00:04:27,00:04:32,"yeah. The meninges is the kind of tough stuff that covers their brain, which means that at least"
00:04:32,00:04:36,the brain isn't sticking out of the head. That's interesting. I don't know that. And also that
00:04:36,00:04:40,"little hole there, that is what the company baby gap is named after."
00:04:40,00:04:46,"I was just looking at sort of things that happen in the brain, unusual processes and things like"
00:04:46,00:04:51,"that. Yeah, I really like this. Your brain is so fast that you can judge whether someone is"
00:04:51,00:04:56,"trustworthy or not, even if you haven't seen them consciously. Okay. So they tried this thing where"
00:04:56,00:05:00,"they showed people images for it like a fraction of it, like a millisecond, a couple of milliseconds,"
00:05:00,00:05:06,right? Too fast for people to consciously register they had seen a face. Yeah. They were either faces
00:05:06,00:05:09,"that were, you know, untrustworthy looking or trustworthy looking or whatever. I don't know"
00:05:09,00:05:14,"what the criteria were. What is that? Is it like one person they've got, you know, a fag out the"
00:05:14,00:05:21,"corner of their mouth and a big overcoat on? And a bag-tank swag. Yeah. No, I have no idea. Maybe"
00:05:21,00:05:24,they had to assess from people what they found trustworthy or untrustworthy first. Because
00:05:24,00:05:28,some people might only trust people who look like sort of comedy burglars from the 1980s.
00:05:28,00:05:32,"But when they showed them those images, even for a fraction of a second, they didn't consciously"
00:05:32,00:05:37,"see them. But the bit of their brain, the amygdala, which processes strong emotions,"
00:05:37,00:05:41,"particularly in relation to whether you trust someone or not, fired up. Wow. It's not weird."
00:05:41,00:05:46,Wow. Do you know what the amygdala means? Ormond. Yeah. The brain is just full of
00:05:46,00:05:51,weirdly named stuff because it's like a structure and people could look at it hundreds of years ago
00:05:51,00:05:55,if they took out someone's brain after they died and like name the bits of the structure. It's just
00:05:55,00:06:01,"got all really old fashioned, odd names. Like almond. Seahorse. Indeed. Oh yeah, the seahorse."
00:06:01,00:06:06,"Because like if you are looking at someone's brain and you're like, which bit do I need to take out?"
00:06:06,00:06:11,"And they say, well, it's the blood, blood, fontanelle or whatever. You wouldn't know what it was. But if"
00:06:11,00:06:15,"you say the seahorse, you can look at it and go, oh, that looks a bit like a seahorse. I'll take"
00:06:15,00:06:22,"that bit out. Yeah. And the martyr, the pia martyr and the other martyrs, they're named after the"
00:06:22,00:06:29,facts that they kind of cover things like a mother might hold her baby. They come from the Arabic.
00:06:29,00:06:32,"Wow. I wondered with the speed that you were talking about a second ago, Andy,"
00:06:32,00:06:38,"the like, I was just thinking a quiz show, right? How quickly does the answer come to you"
00:06:38,00:06:42,"prior to your finger, the information getting to your finger and you pressing a buzzer, right?"
00:06:42,00:06:47,"If you were able to hook up your brain to the bit that lights up that says you know the answer,"
00:06:47,00:06:51,how quick could it be? Are you pitching a quiz where no one actually asks the questions and
00:06:51,00:06:56,"people just buzzing and say, no, no, you need the question. Are you thinking like you're going"
00:06:56,00:07:00,"university challenge, everyone else is using their fingers like absolute noobs and you've"
00:07:00,00:07:03,got something attached to your actual brain. Competitive advantage. You've got your head on
00:07:03,00:07:11,"the button. Exactly. That's it. I look like I'm keeled over, but no. Shriver Australia."
00:07:11,00:07:18,The only flaw in your plan is that you actually wouldn't know any of the answers anyway. So
00:07:18,00:07:24,it doesn't matter how you're pressing the button. I've genuinely never got an answer right on a
00:07:24,00:07:28,"university challenge. No, I think that's good. But they show you the question for a millisecond"
00:07:28,00:07:32,"at the part of your brain associated with Turkmenistan fires, then it's actually a team of"
00:07:32,00:07:38,neuroscientists who answer the question for you. But like several days later after the analysis.
00:07:38,00:07:43,But is the kind of thing your brain does and mostly I associate this sort of thing with
00:07:44,00:07:49,"that, you know, there's that split brain operation that used to be done on epileptic"
00:07:49,00:07:54,"people. It was like, it was a revolutionary operation. And you basically cut the brain"
00:07:54,00:07:58,"in half down the corpus callosum, which is a bit that splits the left side from the right side of"
00:07:58,00:08:03,the brain. And it was amazing because it stopped people having epileptic fits when nothing else
00:08:03,00:08:09,"would work. They did loads of experiments on these people whose two brains were working fine,"
00:08:09,00:08:12,"but they couldn't communicate with each other. And so the reason I thought, for instance, of that"
00:08:12,00:08:18,"university challenge thing was that someone who'd had that operation, they would be shown a picture"
00:08:18,00:08:24,"of a face to their right eye, which goes into the left hemisphere. And they're asked what they've"
00:08:24,00:08:29,"seen. And they can say face. But if it goes into the other eye and into the opposite hemisphere,"
00:08:29,00:08:33,"because it's going to the wrong hemisphere that doesn't process language, once they're asked"
00:08:33,00:08:37,"what they've seen, they can't say face, but they can draw a face. I mean, the language is still"
00:08:37,00:08:42,"completely fine. But they'll just say, I've got no idea what I've seen. But their hand will draw a"
00:08:42,00:08:47,"face. Here's my pitch. Yeah. It's a cop drama, right? And there's a witness to a crime, but you"
00:08:47,00:08:52,"only saw it with one eye, the eye which doesn't know what. But he can draw it. And you've got a"
00:08:52,00:09:00,"cop, but he's only got the other eye. Yes. And it's basically Pictionary, Pictionary cop. That's"
00:09:00,00:09:05,"actually really good. And that can be a sequel to Dictionary cop, which is... Oh, right. I thought"
00:09:05,00:09:11,"you're going to be like Buckaroo cop, Mousetrap cop. Jenga cop. He's got two hours to stop this"
00:09:11,00:09:17,"building falling over. Yeah. It's not got any mortar. It's just bricks. But you know, fine."
00:09:17,00:09:22,"It's a dry stone building. And one of the bricks has got a bomb in it, but he doesn't know which"
00:09:22,00:09:27,one. So he has to keep removing the bricks to find the bomb without the building falling down.
00:09:27,00:09:31,But it's in a very congested area. So he can only put the bricks on top of the building at the top.
00:09:31,00:09:38,This is quite good. Dry stone wall is probably set at the Cotswolds. So he's had some lovely
00:09:38,00:09:44,"location filming before the... Yeah, yeah. This is bloody good. Jenga cop. There is just one"
00:09:44,00:09:51,"other possible spy film, follow up, where you can basically get people to say things that they"
00:09:51,00:09:55,"don't know they've said, I guess, because there was another guy who'd had his brain cut in half."
00:09:55,00:09:59,"And they asked him the question to one side of his brain. They flashed the question,"
00:09:59,00:10:04,"who's your favourite girlfriend? He was a little boy. Oh, right. Who's your favourite girlfriend?"
00:10:04,00:10:07,"And then he was asked, do you know what question we've asked you? And he was shrugged and was like,"
00:10:07,00:10:12,"no, I haven't seen anything. I didn't see anything. But then he giggled, said no,"
00:10:12,00:10:16,and then spelled out Liz in Scrabble Tiles with his other hand. How awful is that? You're just
00:10:16,00:10:21,"giving stuff away. Scrabble Tiles, 10 points as well for the Zed. He put on a triple hurt score"
00:10:21,00:10:27,"as well. Well, it makes you a follow up. Scrabble cop. Scrabble cop. That's good."
00:10:27,00:10:31,"Have you guys heard of hemmy neglect, which is kind of in the same sphere here? Hemmy neglect."
00:10:31,00:10:36,Hemmy neglect is when this is people who have had a stroke. There's a bit of brain damage that
00:10:36,00:10:42,goes on whereby they only experience basically one side of their visual field. So if they've gone
00:10:42,00:10:47,"to shave, they'll shave off half their face, but leave the other side because it's just not"
00:10:47,00:10:50,"part of their field anymore, right? If they're eating on a plate, they'll eat the right side"
00:10:50,00:10:54,or left side of the plate. They'll eat just one side of the plate. So it's not just that you can't
00:10:54,00:10:57,"see presumably, it's that your brain refuses to acknowledge that. Your brain is refusing to"
00:10:57,00:11:02,acknowledge that. Yeah. But this is what's amazing. They started looking into hemmy neglect within
00:11:02,00:11:08,memory as well. So they managed to find a group of people where all of them had been to Milan.
00:11:08,00:11:12,"So they asked them the exact same thing, you're standing in the major plaza in Milan,"
00:11:12,00:11:16,"recall as many stores and streets around you as possible in the square,"
00:11:16,00:11:20,and they could only remember the stores and the streets that were on the right side and not the
00:11:20,00:11:24,"left. Probably good memories though. He asked me to name a shop, you know, on a square I'd lived on"
00:11:24,00:11:29,for about 20 years. I probably couldn't do it. I could name a shop in Milan in the central square
00:11:29,00:11:34,"but yeah, because they recently got their first Starbucks and it was some controversy because"
00:11:34,00:11:40,"obviously Milan, the home of coffee, good coffee, and there was a Starbucks there. It was very nice"
00:11:40,00:11:45,"Starbucks too. So that prompted a bit of local discussion. Or according to these people, there"
00:11:45,00:11:52,"was a Bucks. Yeah. All of our brains are smaller than they would have been 3,000 years ago if we'd"
00:11:52,00:11:58,"been born then. We've lost about four ping pong balls worth of brain. Whoa, that's a lot. It is"
00:11:58,00:12:03,"quite a lot and it's not exactly clear what caused it because we invented agriculture 10,000 years"
00:12:03,00:12:08,ago as a species. It's not that. Writing dates back several thousand years and it might be something
00:12:08,00:12:12,to do with that. It might be that I keep part of my brain in all of your brains.
00:12:12,00:12:18,"I wonder what that was. No, but like if you have lots of division of labor and you have a complicated"
00:12:18,00:12:22,"system, you sort of divide up the cognitive tasks and you need a bit less brain space. Yeah. I think"
00:12:22,00:12:27,there is a theory that domestication makes your brain smaller because it works with animals for
00:12:27,00:12:31,"sure. So am I domesticated? Well, I think humans are domesticated, aren't we? Well, no, we're the"
00:12:31,00:12:36,"domesticators. But who's domesticated us, aside from cat, according to some interpretation."
00:12:36,00:12:44,"The man. The man. Society has domesticated us. To be fair, I don't think I would thrive in the"
00:12:44,00:12:49,"wild. I don't think you would either. I concur. Dan, anything to do with you? Do you contradict that"
00:12:49,00:12:54,"statement? No, I think well, I'm going off getting some berries and Anna's going off killing a wild"
00:12:54,00:13:00,cat. And you are trying to think of some cop dramas. I don't know which of us is going to be the most
00:13:00,00:13:06,"useful in the group. In the future, we will need cop dramas to survive. We'll need that hope that"
00:13:06,00:13:13,"comes from like, will you find the bomb? Yeah. Okay, brain fart. Yeah. Like when you have a moment,"
00:13:13,00:13:18,"you can't remember something, right? Yeah. Yeah. This podcast has been a 10 year long one, for"
00:13:18,00:13:25,instance. Sure. Yeah. What about a brain squared? What is that? Brain squared time. It's where you
00:13:25,00:13:30,"try and think of one thing, and it just shoves out tons of different things. It's like, someone"
00:13:30,00:13:34,"says, what's the capital of Malawi? And all you can think of is every other capital in Africa."
00:13:34,00:13:39,"Oh, good. Yes. No, I was saying, yeah, that's probably closer than to mine, which you would be"
00:13:39,00:13:46,saying things that sounded right as a ramble. So like a quiz question like that. But you genuinely
00:13:46,00:13:52,"went, it's Michael's, no, Sarah, Joey, Chandler, right? Mums do when they're trying to remember"
00:13:52,00:14:01,"your name. They always run through, don't they? John, Katie, Claire, Hannah, James, James, come over"
00:14:01,00:14:07,"here. It's just a feeble or abortive attempt at reasoning, but it dates back to the 1650s."
00:14:07,00:14:12,"They're cool. Really? I'm having a brain squirt. It was also, this dates back to Old English,"
00:14:12,00:14:18,your brain locker. What is that? Brain locker. Brain locker. It's someone who looks at a brain
00:14:18,00:14:24,"in South Africa. It's my brain locker. It's just your head. I was going to say, it's your skull."
00:14:24,00:14:30,My brain locker. My brain locker. Crazy that we had a word for that. It's like one little hack. I was
00:14:30,00:14:34,"reading a lot of neuroscientists saying how you can hack your brain to make sure that, so if you're"
00:14:34,00:14:38,"someone who forgets things a lot, or you have something important that you need to remember,"
00:14:38,00:14:42,"and you just don't, you can't find it, write it down or anything, take something, take an object,"
00:14:42,00:14:46,"and just place it somewhere it shouldn't be. So if you're leaving the house, for example,"
00:14:46,00:14:52,"and you're like, oh, why is this, you know, flute here? Yeah. It'll make you go, ah, yes,"
00:14:52,00:14:57,I've been meaning to do that thing. It's a way of associating with a physical object. So that's
00:14:57,00:15:01,"just a great hack. I feel like, you know, I do that with my hair bands. I put one hair band on"
00:15:01,00:15:04,the other wrist if I need to remember something. I'll be the second one on the other wrist if I
00:15:04,00:15:07,need to remember a second thing. And then I put one back on the first wrist if I need to remember
00:15:07,00:15:21,"a third thing. Oh, shit. Okay, it is time for fact number two. And that is my fact. My fact this"
00:15:21,00:15:28,"week is that at the 1984 US Grand Prix, it was thought that Ayrton Senna crashed into a wall"
00:15:28,00:15:35,on the 47th lap. But it turns out it was actually the wall that crashed into him. This is another
00:15:35,00:15:43,"case of a Jenga cop, I feel. This is an amazing story. So Senna is one of the greatest Formula"
00:15:43,00:15:48,"1 drivers ever. His career was cut short, because sadly, 10 years later, he did have a crash in a"
00:15:48,00:15:56,"Grand Prix, which he died. So basically, he was in this Grand Prix, and he's heading on cutting a"
00:15:56,00:16:01,"corner, very tight to the wall as he had done on previous laps. He nicks it. So afterwards,"
00:16:01,00:16:07,"they're talking about it, and he says, ""There's no way I hit that wall. I'm a precision driver."""
00:16:07,00:16:14,"And he was very cocky, Senna. ""I'm a precision driver. That wall came into me."" So they went out"
00:16:14,00:16:18,"just because, I guess, you know, they thought, ""Well, maybe he's right. Let's check it out."" And"
00:16:18,00:16:23,"they noticed that the wall had moved. And the reason was, is because a car-"
00:16:23,00:16:27,"Is a human dressed as a wall, wasn't it? Who was hiding from the Jenga cop?"
00:16:27,00:16:31,"But it was also saying anti-Catholic propaganda at the time, wasn't it?"
00:16:31,00:16:40,"Cool. Back to last episode, everyone. So basically, these walls were giant,"
00:16:40,00:16:45,"concrete blocks. And on a previous lap, a car had also hit this wall. And what they'd notice"
00:16:45,00:16:50,was that it hit it with such force that it had knocked the back of it. And so the front bit
00:16:50,00:16:58,"jutted out a tiny bit, but only by 10 millimeters is what they were saying that he was so precise."
00:16:58,00:17:02,He was so precise that that was enough. He knew exactly where he needed to take it.
00:17:02,00:17:07,And so he nicked the wall. And this is how he is sort of known. He's known as this guy.
00:17:07,00:17:15,"He was the best. I believe so. I mean, there's countless arguments in Formula One fans, but"
00:17:15,00:17:19,"for me, he was the best. There you go. You heard it here first."
00:17:19,00:17:22,"So tragically, because he was cut off in his prime, we don't know where he would have taken it to."
00:17:22,00:17:28,"He won three world championships. He's been surpassed by Schumacher and others,"
00:17:28,00:17:32,"but that's because of the longevity of a career. So yeah, hard to know where he would have gone."
00:17:32,00:17:39,I didn't know why it's called Formula One. And it's just the whole point of Formula One is that
00:17:39,00:17:43,there is a formula. And it's this set of rules that you have to adhere to. And they change the
00:17:43,00:17:47,"rules every, I don't know, every year or every couple of years. And then everyone has to build"
00:17:47,00:17:51,entirely new cars and it's a nightmare. And that is the formula that everyone's complying with.
00:17:51,00:17:54,"And that's about the weight and the aerodynamics and the blah, blah, blah. And I used to know,"
00:17:54,00:18:00,"what I do know, someone, a friend of mine, used to work on Formula One doing the kind of modelling,"
00:18:00,00:18:06,"the computer modelling of the aerodynamics of the cars. Basically, you just do that hundreds of"
00:18:06,00:18:10,thousands of times and modelling the airflow over a car to work out what's going to be best.
00:18:10,00:18:15,And then they change the rules and then you have to adjust everything in a fraction of a millimeter
00:18:15,00:18:20,in all of this. It's amazing. And try and push it slightly further than everyone else is pushing it.
00:18:20,00:18:25,"Yeah, because there must be one perfect car, theoretically. Oh, right. That would be the,"
00:18:25,00:18:30,have the perfect aerodynamics for these rules. I don't know. And they all cross the line at the
00:18:30,00:18:39,same time. That's when you have to bring in some variables like Mario Kart. The Red Shells. The
00:18:39,00:18:49,"Benefit. Rainbow Road. A bubble that you drive into. Blop, blop, blop. I mean, it would all liven up"
00:18:49,00:18:54,"what is sometimes quite a dry sport to watch. It is very, this is, I think, true of quite a lot"
00:18:54,00:18:58,"of sports, which is if you're not really into them and you watch them, they seem quite boring on the"
00:18:58,00:19:02,"outside. And then as soon as you start reading about them, it's like, oh my God, this is incredible."
00:19:02,00:19:06,"Yeah, that's definitely true of everyone, isn't it? Otherwise, it is just people going round and"
00:19:06,00:19:10,"round at a thing. But yeah, you can't make the cars too good. And obviously, there are rules to"
00:19:10,00:19:14,"stop you doing that. Partly for safety, because if you go too fast, it's very bad. And safety has"
00:19:14,00:19:19,massively cracked down the last sort of 30 years. But there have been great cars made in the past
00:19:19,00:19:23,"that they've had to change the rules to stop happening again, like the six-wheeled car."
00:19:23,00:19:28,"Do we have the six-wheeled? Yeah, it's so cool. It's amazing. Was it designed by Homer Simpson?"
00:19:28,00:19:35,"Yes, it was. No, this was in the 1970s. And it was Tyrell, one of the teams,"
00:19:35,00:19:39,"raced a six-wheeled car. Realised that there would be an advantage to it, because if you have"
00:19:39,00:19:44,"four smaller wheels at the front rather than two big wheels, then I think you increase the amount"
00:19:44,00:19:50,of contact with the ground. So you've got more grip on the road. More traction on the corners.
00:19:50,00:19:55,"Honestly, that is like, they've got someone in from the outside who's never worked in"
00:19:55,00:19:59,"Formula One before and said, look at this. How can we improve this car? And they've gone,"
00:19:59,00:20:04,"""More wheels?"" Imagine being in that meeting, though. They were looking through it. We've"
00:20:04,00:20:08,looked through the manual 30 times now. There's nothing which says the maximum number of wheels
00:20:08,00:20:12,"is for you. You can do it. That must be something in the rules, something. That must be every other"
00:20:12,00:20:16,car ever. They didn't think of putting it in the rules. It's like saying you can't have a crocodile
00:20:16,00:20:22,"driving. They didn't think of that. There is no rule about the number of wheels, largely because"
00:20:22,00:20:25,"they did this. And at the time, there were various slight problems with it, because they hadn't"
00:20:25,00:20:30,"perfected the technology yet, because they'd only just invented the six-wheeled car. They did get a"
00:20:30,00:20:34,"few podium finishes, I think, for that car. But the FIA banned it in the end, because they worried"
00:20:34,00:20:38,that we'd just get to a place where people were putting more and more wheels on cars. You just
00:20:38,00:20:44,have 100 wheels on a car. I think they did win. They won one Grand Prix with the Swedish Grand Prix.
00:20:44,00:20:47,What a vindication that must have been. What a moment.
00:20:47,00:20:53,"Are the cars longer? Because that's an advantage as well, right? For tight finishes. If your car is"
00:20:53,00:20:59,suddenly 10 metres long. I think of one problem is when you go into the pit stop to change your
00:20:59,00:21:06,"tyres. If you have to change 200 times, it's going to take ages. Oh, those are... I love the pit"
00:21:06,00:21:09,"stops. Yeah. Those are the... Because that's a matter of variation in the race, isn't it? And they"
00:21:09,00:21:14,"used to have a lollipop man. Yeah. It's so sweet, really. It's really sad that they don't anymore,"
00:21:14,00:21:18,I think. Because they always build the tracks next to primary schools.
00:21:22,00:21:28,But I do wonder. You just got a little old lady and a smart... He's chatting to some of the mums
00:21:28,00:21:33,"and all the drivers and going, ""Can I cross? Can I cross?"" This pit stop has now lasted 18 minutes."
00:21:33,00:21:39,So their job basically was to know when everyone had finished their jobs and then they
00:21:39,00:21:43,lift up the lollipop and they could drive off. But now everyone just has a button. When you've
00:21:43,00:21:46,"done your job, you finish your things and your lights change. Just rubbish. And that's... Oh,"
00:21:46,00:21:51,that must be stressful as well. Because I can readily imagine fitting the wheel in 0.4 seconds
00:21:51,00:21:55,"and then forgetting to press my button. Yeah. Well, if you had your head bugged on your left wrist,"
00:21:55,00:22:02,"here's a crazy pit stop thing that you're not allowed to do anymore, which is... And do you"
00:22:02,00:22:06,"guys remember ages ago, Lewis Hamilton, there was a bit of controversy about one of the races where"
00:22:06,00:22:13,you have your team. So he's... What's his team again? He's with... Mercedes. So he'd be on the track
00:22:13,00:22:17,"with another Mercedes rider, part of the same team. It made more sense for Lewis to win. So there was"
00:22:17,00:22:21,this big controversy that the guy in the lead slowed down and let Lewis take the win for the
00:22:21,00:22:27,"points for the team, basically. It is fine, but it's seen as... It's not sport, basically. It's..."
00:22:27,00:22:30,"They should be trying. Yeah. But they do the same in cycling, don't they? I thought they"
00:22:30,00:22:35,"happened to have one. In cycling, it's basically the whole spot. Yeah. I think in Formula One, it's"
00:22:35,00:22:40,obviously taboo because it was a big controversy at the time when Lewis did it. Yeah. But so what
00:22:40,00:22:45,"you used to be able to do in a pit stop is, let's say you have damaged your car. Yeah. You could"
00:22:45,00:22:49,come in and they've called over the number two because you're the lead driver and they would
00:22:49,00:22:55,"just give you his car. Wicked. So he would be out of the race. So your number two driver, you would"
00:22:55,00:23:00,"want them to be pretty much exactly the same as you, right? If you're six foot three with a very"
00:23:00,00:23:04,"spindly arms, you need another six foot three with spindly arms. Well, so you don't have to factor"
00:23:04,00:23:12,"around adjusting the seat and then changing the air con. Oh, radio one. But that is the thing,"
00:23:12,00:23:17,isn't it? Because they all get weighed after the race. The driver and the car are weighed
00:23:17,00:23:22,"because if you're too light, it might be dangerous and drivers lose about three kilos during a race"
00:23:22,00:23:26,"of hydration, of water weight. Because it's so sweaty, right? Yeah. It's so sweaty. It apparently"
00:23:26,00:23:30,"gets so hot in there as well. Like that's what's, you know, it's sweaty, it's hot, it's boiling,"
00:23:30,00:23:34,"and Damon Hill, there's a story. I couldn't find a good source for it, but it's claimed in a bunch"
00:23:34,00:23:41,"of places that he brings in, for some reason, a thermos of cold black tea and the heat of the car"
00:23:41,00:23:47,makes it a nice piping hot tea for it to drink. I heard that. That's very funny. The safety stuff
00:23:47,00:23:52,"is just nuts in the cars these days. It's so impressive. So these days, every single driver"
00:23:52,00:23:59,"has a monocoque. It was when they used to have two cars, there was so many deaths. It was tripping"
00:23:59,00:24:05,"over a lot. It's getting in the way of the levers. No, it's a cocoon, basically. It surrounds the"
00:24:05,00:24:10,"driver and it's sort of the core of the car. And it's like the, I want to say a very hard bag."
00:24:11,00:24:15,"Like, it surrounds the driver and it keeps them safe even if they crash. So they get into a bag?"
00:24:15,00:24:21,They didn't know. I'm misoldering dramatically. It's just like the sort of central command pod
00:24:21,00:24:25,"of the car, which actually encases the driver. If you can imagine the meninges of the press,"
00:24:25,00:24:30,it's almost like the meninges of the driver. Exactly. It's like the very toughest mother.
00:24:30,00:24:34,"Only they called it that. I would have thrown it straight away. Yeah. And the, you know, the helmets"
00:24:34,00:24:39,"are amazing. They have to be subjected, the helmets have to be subjected to 800 degree heat for 45"
00:24:39,00:24:43,seconds in case there's a fire or they have to be hot tea or hot tea.
00:24:43,00:24:50,"The boss has really taken a pattering. Every time you blink, you lose 20 meters of road."
00:24:50,00:24:54,If you're going in fast Formula One car. So you have to be careful when you blink.
00:24:54,00:24:58,Yeah. They've measured it and like drivers always blink at the same part of the course.
00:24:58,00:25:04,It's really interesting. Yeah. I read that one thing that if you play the sounds of the cars
00:25:04,00:25:08,"on a Formula One track to a Formula One driver, they'll be able to tell which track it is just"
00:25:08,00:25:12,from the sounds that the cars make. Wow. Isn't that amazing? That's incredible.
00:25:12,00:25:19,"You need a special driver's license? Oh really? Perhaps, unsurprisingly. You need a super license."
00:25:19,00:25:24,That's what it's called. Really? Yeah. Is that right? So does that mean if I took part in the Las Vegas
00:25:24,00:25:29,"Grand Prix starts this weekend? Yeah. If I flew over to Las Vegas and took part in it, I'd get"
00:25:29,00:25:34,"points for not having the right license. I think you probably will get points. Yeah, yeah. Wow."
00:25:34,00:25:40,Do it anyway. I'll try it. Shall I try it? In your electric car as well. They accelerate like
00:25:40,00:25:45,"that. They do accelerate well, but I'm not sure I could get around all the laps without retouching."
00:25:45,00:25:51,"He's now had a lovely coffee at the Supercharger. I wonder if, you know, psychopaths is that idea"
00:25:51,00:25:57,"that they don't blink. I wonder if that would make you a better, there's one way apparently of spotting"
00:25:57,00:26:02,a psychopath according to people who look into it is they blink much less than a regular person.
00:26:02,00:26:05,That's why they're forced to kill and kill again because they're so annoyed about their dry eyes.
00:26:05,00:26:10,I just wonder if you blink less. Are you a better driver? Are they all psychopaths? Is that what
00:26:10,00:26:15,"you're saying? All these F1 drivers? Well, Senna, just back to him very quickly, sounded a bit"
00:26:15,00:26:22,"sort of like he was in an odd mental place a lot of the time. Well, as in like, whenever he arrived,"
00:26:22,00:26:26,"his friend said, he'd never said hi. Like if he was coming to a race, he was just in a zone. He was"
00:26:26,00:26:31,"just always kind of like angry. That's like rude. God, I said hi to you this morning and it was an"
00:26:31,00:26:37,"effort, frankly, but I didn't. I think that's really normal. Like I would say if you're racing,"
00:26:37,00:26:42,I can imagine not saying hello to anyone like you've got to be so in the zone. Yes. How many
00:26:42,00:26:45,"people are you having to say hi to? Because if it's just one or two people who are welcoming you,"
00:26:45,00:26:48,"you're like, oh, yeah, great. You have a nice chat. But if it's like all the 50 members of the team"
00:26:48,00:26:56,"are saying, hello, I like the big mascot in the silly suit. This is according to someone who works"
00:26:56,00:27:02,"for the catering operation, Lindy Redding. She said she said he would never say hi if he was in the"
00:27:02,00:27:09,"zone. But when he did say hello, it was very genuine. He used to kiss us and hold our faces,"
00:27:09,00:27:15,"which was hugely intense, but absolutely lovely. You know what? Let's do the not hello next time."
00:27:15,00:27:22,This is great. That's the greeting equivalent of doing the washing up so badly that they never
00:27:22,00:27:32,"asked. Speaking of motor racing drivers, have you guys heard of Hella nice? Hella nice."
00:27:32,00:27:43,Hella nice. Yeah. It was a person from the 1920s. Real name Mariette Ellen Delong. She was an exotic
00:27:43,00:27:49,dancer who danced at the Ritz in Paris. And then she had a skiing accident and couldn't dance anymore.
00:27:49,00:27:56,And so became a racing driver. And she raced in five major Grand Prix in France. And she was in
00:27:56,00:27:59,an accident. This is why I was reading about her because we were talking about safety. She was
00:27:59,00:28:05,in an accident where she was in an Alpha Romeo and she's somersaulted through the air. And she
00:28:05,00:28:10,"wasn't wearing a seatbelt because she didn't have to in those days. Her car went into the crowd,"
00:28:10,00:28:15,killed four people. But she survived because she landed on a soldier who absorbed the full
00:28:15,00:28:23,"impact of her body saving her life. Did he die? No, he didn't die. Sorry, did she"
00:28:23,00:28:28,"fly through the air or did her car, her car went one direction, killed some people."
00:28:28,00:28:33,She went in the other direction and luckily landed on this very pliant soldier. Wow. And they later
00:28:33,00:28:39,"married. I don't think they did now. That's amazing. It's incredible what you can survive. I mean,"
00:28:39,00:28:44,now they really saw extraordinary crashes because of the safety. But even when you look back in the
00:28:44,00:28:49,"day, I mean, in 1993, have you seen the quite a famous crash? Two teammates actually who were"
00:28:49,00:28:54,called Fittipaldi and Martini. They were quite near the back. But one of their cars was like just
00:28:54,00:28:58,"behind the other. And I think the left wheel, front wheel of one car nicked the back right"
00:28:58,00:29:04,"wheel of another car. And it sent the front one into a full in the air backflip. Oh yes, yeah."
00:29:04,00:29:10,"Just does a backflip, happily lands, skates over the finish line. It's absolutely stunning. That"
00:29:10,00:29:15,"showboating. It really is, yeah. To begin with the headline, Martini shaken not stirred."
00:29:15,00:29:24,It should have done. Here's a little quiz moment for you all. Okay. Who is the guy who I think has
00:29:24,00:29:28,done more Formula One races than anyone else? I'm 90% sure. He's done more Formula One races
00:29:28,00:29:34,"than anyone else on the planet, more Grand Prix. Grands Prix. Okay. So someone we must know of?"
00:29:34,00:29:40,"No. Is it the Michelin man? It's not the Michelin man. Anna, I feel like you might have the answer."
00:29:40,00:29:45,I've just got my hand up. I'm bursting. Are you talking about the safety guy? The guy who drives
00:29:45,00:29:51,"the safety car. Yeah, so good. He's been doing it for nearly 25 years. Yeah. He's done more than 450"
00:29:51,00:29:55,Grand Prix. I can't believe it's the same guy. I just couldn't believe it's just one bloke
00:29:55,00:29:59,"doing every single Grand Prix. So what does he do, sorry? When there's an incident on the track."
00:29:59,00:30:03,"Yeah. There's an accident or like there's a horse ride out on the track, whatever. Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:30:03,00:30:09,"School day finishes. Receptions run out, lady car ladies already."
00:30:09,00:30:14,The safety car drives out onto the track and kind of regulates the service. Everyone has to
00:30:14,00:30:18,"drive slowly. Yeah, he drives around at 20 miles an hour and everyone has to just slowly go behind"
00:30:18,00:30:22,"them and you're not allowed to overtake anyone. Yes, of course. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You know that"
00:30:22,00:30:26,feeling when you're driving and someone's kind of coming up your arse? Imagine that like times a
00:30:26,00:30:31,million. This is what that guy's going through every single day. Someone coming up his arse times
00:30:31,00:30:43,"a million. That is a tough job. That was work today, darling. Well, 20 men coming up my arse."
00:30:43,00:30:50,"Want to sit down? No, it's alright. It's alright. After 25 years, you're kind of, you're hard into it."
00:30:55,00:31:08,"Okay, he's a professional racing driver. He's called Burt Maylender. That's great though. That's"
00:31:08,00:31:12,"really cool. I mean, I guess he's not had any accidents himself over all that time. So"
00:31:12,00:31:17,"I guess it's quite stressful and he says the most, can you guess the most stressful person to have"
00:31:17,00:31:23,"behind you? What is in which racing driver is? Yeah, because I said they're quite aggressive"
00:31:23,00:31:28,"sometimes. It must be Schumacher. It's actually Lewis Hamilton, he says. Lewis Hamilton's really"
00:31:28,00:31:33,"up in your face or I'm like zigzagging everywhere, like really pushing, going up towards you."
00:31:33,00:31:37,"What was the point? You have to stay behind them. No, you keep your tyres warm by zigzagging."
00:31:37,00:31:43,I think it's the most precise sport in the world. You guys have just written a book about sports.
00:31:43,00:31:52,"The big book of sports. Everything to play for, the QI book of sports. But surely this is the most,"
00:31:52,00:31:56,"this is where the most thought has gone into the most tiny differences of like,"
00:31:56,00:32:02,"yeah, it is amazing. Technologically for sure. Right. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. Like even in the formula,"
00:32:02,00:32:08,there are even limits on the amount of data you're allowed to use to simulate the car aerodynamics.
00:32:08,00:32:14,You're limited to 25 teraflops of computing power when you're running the computer simulations
00:32:14,00:32:19,"of air flowing over a car you haven't even built yet. And then after all that stuff,"
00:32:19,00:32:23,"like literally last night in the warm up for the Las Vegas Grand Prix,"
00:32:23,00:32:29,"someone hadn't nailed down one of the manhole covers properly, just smashed into the car."
00:32:29,00:32:34,"Oh my God, I heard about that. They get sucked up. Yeah. Why do they keep building manhole covers"
00:32:34,00:32:40,"on the F1 tracks? Well, because it's it's in the actual streets of Las Vegas. And they have to"
00:32:40,00:32:44,nail down every single manhole cover. I think they might not even use nails. They might use
00:32:44,00:32:48,"like concrete or something. God, you don't want to be sort of a sewerage work who pops up at the"
00:32:48,00:32:55,"wrong one. Oh fuck. An escaped convict. Yeah, yeah. That's it, isn't it?"
00:32:55,00:33:08,"Okay, it is time for fact number three, and that is Andy. My fact is, there is such a thing"
00:33:08,00:33:21,"as a ghost pond. Oh, splash. Yeah. This is a, so we're all familiar with ponds. Maybe just give us"
00:33:21,00:33:28,"a just for the people not from the UK. Well, no, actually, then, because, you know, what is a pond"
00:33:28,00:33:36,"and what is a lake? So it's a very large hill with just matter on it. Oh, no, it's the opposite"
00:33:36,00:33:41,"of that. It's a small indentation with water in it. That's right. Sorry, I always get those mixed up."
00:33:41,00:33:47,"Oh, you caught me there. You have me going. But basically, there are these things all over,"
00:33:47,00:33:51,"particularly the UK, but I'm sure in other countries too. In fact, all over Europe, they"
00:33:51,00:33:55,"do know that. And they, like all the farms in England used to have ponds, like fields would"
00:33:55,00:34:00,"have a pond here or there in them, and they would either provide water for cattle or they would,"
00:34:00,00:34:04,"you know, they're just useful things to have. But then over the years, they got abandoned"
00:34:04,00:34:08,"and lots of them dried up. Oh, maybe they got choked by fallen leaves, you know, and all these"
00:34:08,00:34:13,ponds are now missing from the UK. There used to be twice as many ponds as there are today in
00:34:13,00:34:19,"the 1970s. Double the ponds. Yeah, I know. Like, why is no one marching? Why is no one superglaring"
00:34:19,00:34:24,"themselves to Heathrow Airport to bring the ponds back? Well, I think it's important that they're"
00:34:24,00:34:30,like ponds are great because so many animals and plants just. They want to.
00:34:31,00:34:38,That was Dubai. Yeah.
00:34:38,00:34:44,That's right. I've got a pond. Have you got a pond? Anyone else got a pond?
00:34:44,00:34:48,"I want to. It's on my list of things I'd like to do is to dig a pond. Very easy. Just dig a pond,"
00:34:48,00:34:52,"put some lining in it. Yeah. Sorry, can you just tell us what these ghost ponds are there?"
00:34:52,00:34:54,"Well, okay. So ghost ponds basically are about my pond."
00:34:54,00:34:58,Just tell us anything. We're passing the pond in a minute.
00:34:58,00:35:02,"But no, basically, they're huge biodiversity hotspots. You know, you get you get plants and"
00:35:02,00:35:06,species and dragonflies and beetles and all sorts of stuff where before you just have a field and
00:35:06,00:35:11,"you know, they're really important for that. And basically the mud remembers. It's really weird."
00:35:11,00:35:17,So all of these ancient seeds might be left in the indentation that used to be a pond and they
00:35:17,00:35:21,"can survive for over a century. And all you have to do if you have that little dip in the ground,"
00:35:21,00:35:26,"you refill it, expose it to sunlight and these old species just spring up and they come back"
00:35:26,00:35:31,"with a vengeance. And it's kind of staggering. So there's a team at UCL, the pond restoration"
00:35:31,00:35:35,"research group led by Carl Sayer, and they've been going around Norfolk restoring these ghost"
00:35:35,00:35:41,"ponds. And suddenly, bang, life, biodiversity, really important stuff, which is really under"
00:35:41,00:35:47,"threat at the moment. They reckon there's 600,000 that are hidden still waiting to be restored"
00:35:47,00:35:53,"in the UK alone. It's amazing. And it's longer than that, isn't it, for seeds? I'm sure we've"
00:35:53,00:35:58,"mentioned and I can't remember the exact number, but like the oldest seed ever found that can still"
00:35:58,00:36:02,"be, you know, watered and sunlit and grow is many thousands of years old. And so yeah, these can be"
00:36:02,00:36:09,"many hundreds. And what I really like is that you can sort of see a ghostly evidence of them,"
00:36:09,00:36:14,"can't you? Like from above, you can see it as like a slightly damp depression or it's a bit where"
00:36:14,00:36:18,"crops don't grow as well, because it's always been a bit too wet, the soils never dried out."
00:36:18,00:36:23,"And I think often farmers, when they're expanding their land, rather than drain them, because that's"
00:36:23,00:36:27,"a hassle draining a pond, they just dump a load of earth in them, wouldn't they? Or a"
00:36:27,00:36:31,"load of plant matter, which doesn't stop them being wet. So they have left their little pond"
00:36:31,00:36:37,"prints. So cool. But also I think ponds, they kind of have like a life duration, don't they?"
00:36:37,00:36:42,"If you have a pond, like a pond farm, as you dig out a pond, right, because you're a farmer,"
00:36:42,00:36:48,"if you just leave it, after about 100 years, it'll just cease to be. Oh, really? Yeah, they just kind"
00:36:48,00:36:53,"of, they slowly silt up and silt up and silt up and then they die. And it could be just like one"
00:36:53,00:36:58,"really heavy rainstorm. A load of silt comes down, they're not a pond anymore. They're just like these"
00:36:58,00:37:01,"ephemeral things that kind of come and go. They have to be kind of maintained, don't they? A little"
00:37:01,00:37:04,"bit. They do. You clear out the leaves and you know, if they've got trees over them, that's a"
00:37:04,00:37:08,"nightmare for a pond, apparently. Sure is. Can I tell you about the leaves that have fallen into my"
00:37:08,00:37:13,"pond? Yeah. How big is your pond? Like the table that we're recording on. Okay, the one that no"
00:37:13,00:37:17,"one can see. It's about half the size of that. Oh, nice. Okay. James would describe something"
00:37:17,00:37:23,"the size of a basin. It's small. It's a small pond. But you know, it's just for animals to come and"
00:37:23,00:37:29,"drink stuff. You're not going to get a deer, are you? A lion kneeling down. I don't think there"
00:37:29,00:37:34,will be wildebeest of lion sipping at my pond in North London. You're not that far from the zoo.
00:37:35,00:37:39,That's true. A catastrophic breakout and suddenly James looks out a watering hole.
00:37:39,00:37:51,"Humans make ponds. What else makes ponds? Aliens. Yes, the equivalent of crop circles,"
00:37:51,00:37:58,"pond circles. Oh, lovely. Yeah, no, non-human animals. Non-human animals. Yes. I reckon like"
00:37:58,00:38:04,"if you're a hippo and you sit down in some mud, then it might create a pond. Good point. Whether"
00:38:04,00:38:10,"or not that would be intentional, I guess would be debated. I'm saying deliberate pond makers."
00:38:10,00:38:14,"Oh, beavers maybe. I guess they're damning things up. It's not really a pond. It's not quite. No."
00:38:14,00:38:19,"So, Andy, if you want to get a pond in your backyard, but you can't be bothered digging,"
00:38:19,00:38:25,"buy yourself a Goliath frog. Oh, great. Yeah. So, Goliath frogs do this. It's a really interesting"
00:38:25,00:38:31,"thing where they move rocks, giant rocks, basically their own weight and they get it so that they cut"
00:38:31,00:38:36,off water and they build their own ponds so that the eggs are more safe in there. They can keep
00:38:36,00:38:40,"attention to them, make sure the tadpoles and so on are all in place. They're their biggest"
00:38:40,00:38:44,"frogs, aren't they? The Goliath frog. If for the people at home who can't see it, there's a glass"
00:38:44,00:38:48,"of water in front of them, they're probably about two or three times bigger than that. Yeah,"
00:38:48,00:38:51,"they're massive, really big. And they think one of the, you know, there's always theories, but one"
00:38:51,00:38:56,"of the theories is that their size is to do with mating, to do with the best rock movers and, you"
00:38:56,00:39:00,"know, that's partially why they may be that big, specifically because they build ponds."
00:39:00,00:39:06,"Do you know what else makes ponds? So, this is a subset of humans. Oh, okay, I was about to say"
00:39:06,00:39:12,elephants. And schoolgirls. Subset of humans. That wasn't what I was thinking of. That can
00:39:12,00:39:16,"as a subset, though. That's a subset of humans. Why? Are you questioning whether or not they're"
00:39:16,00:39:20,humans? I wasn't sure what subset meant. I thought it meant it had to be like people
00:39:20,00:39:25,"from, you know, the southern hemisphere or like, I thought it was bigger than just saying, you know,"
00:39:25,00:39:31,"slipknot fans, you know. Yeah, just a group of humans who make ponds. You used to be a schoolgirl."
00:39:31,00:39:35,"I was trying to think of what a subset of humans would be. Oh, okay. I was just wondering if when"
00:39:35,00:39:38,"you were a schoolgirl, you dug ponds and that you had inside knowledge that I wouldn't have had."
00:39:38,00:39:44,"No, we got taken to ponds. So, we got told about newt. So, not schoolgirls."
00:39:44,00:39:51,"A subset of humans who make ponds. Is it a profession? No, it's more of a ideology."
00:39:51,00:39:56,"Zen gardeners. Oh, okay. That is true, undoubtedly. Not who I was thinking of."
00:39:56,00:40:04,"Communists. Oh, the opposite. Oh, fascists. Nazis. Yes, you got it. So, there's quite a lot"
00:40:04,00:40:11,"of bomb craters around Europe. And if you drop a bomb, it makes a big indentation and that indentation"
00:40:11,00:40:18,"can then collect water and become a pond. Wow. So, that feels like a silver lining."
00:40:18,00:40:20,"It is, really. And possibly a reason to start more wars."
00:40:20,00:40:27,"No. I mean, well, just the Nazis were pond making, right? The Allies were pond making as well. We"
00:40:27,00:40:32,"were all pond making. A lot of ponds in Dresden. Right, right, right. But yeah, a lot of ponds made"
00:40:32,00:40:38,by both sides. And the thing is that they've done some studies on it and they did this in Hungary
00:40:38,00:40:47,in particular. And they found that they found 274 species in ponds made by bombs. And they included
00:40:47,00:40:53,"like, for instance, an algae which has previously only been found in Chilean salt lakes."
00:40:53,00:41:00,And a furry shrimp that had only been recorded twice in the last 25 years in Hungary. And they
00:41:00,00:41:04,"were in these ponds made by bombs. That's amazing. I mean, this is what they find with these ghost"
00:41:04,00:41:08,"ponds when they rejuvenate them. You get species that you haven't seen for many, many years. And"
00:41:08,00:41:13,"it's such a mystery, I think, how stuff turns up, how nature knows. And particularly, I think,"
00:41:13,00:41:18,"in slightly bigger ponds than maybe James's garden pond. But you'll find, no offense."
00:41:18,00:41:22,I can't even imagine a pond bigger than James's garden pond.
00:41:22,00:41:26,"Please don't write in for me taking the piss up, James, having a small pond, okay?"
00:41:26,00:41:30,"Okay, here we are. New name for this podcast. Don't write in."
00:41:30,00:41:34,I was the eels.
00:41:34,00:41:38,James Harkin's podcast. Do you reckon?
00:41:38,00:41:42,"Yeah. Come on, give us that. You will need a bit more detail, but I'm interested."
00:41:42,00:41:45,"Okay, first episode, guess what leaves are falling in my pond?"
00:41:45,00:41:47,Are you having a guest to your pond each week?
00:41:47,00:41:49,"Yeah, but they'll be an animal, so they can't talk."
00:41:49,00:41:53,"First episode of Dragonfly, and they just go..."
00:41:53,00:42:01,Monaco. We have to guess what animal is at your pond chat that week.
00:42:01,00:42:02,"Yeah, that's great."
00:42:02,00:42:03,It's almost always a snail.
00:42:03,00:42:06,"It's never the world of bees, guys."
00:42:06,00:42:10,"So I always have eels in ponds, because how did they get there?"
00:42:10,00:42:10,"Oh, yeah."
00:42:10,00:42:15,And all we know is that eels can move across sort of...
00:42:15,00:42:16,"Not dry land, but across land."
00:42:16,00:42:20,"That's moist, because they can breathe through their skin, not just gills."
00:42:20,00:42:24,"So gills require some pressure for the water to be forced in,"
00:42:24,00:42:25,but they can actually breathe through their skin.
00:42:25,00:42:28,"So they must just flop out of a river,"
00:42:28,00:42:30,but then how do they find their way to someone's garden?
00:42:30,00:42:32,Everyone's looking at me just to say no eels in my pond.
00:42:32,00:42:34,"Oh, that'll be a big, big episode."
00:42:34,00:42:35,All in my hovercraft.
00:42:37,00:42:41,I think it's not an idea that sometimes things get in ponds because they're dropped by birds.
00:42:41,00:42:46,Can I tell you about one of the most interesting ponds in the world?
00:42:46,00:42:47,Please.
00:42:47,00:42:52,"This is called Don Juan Pond in Antarctica, and it's really weird."
00:42:52,00:42:55,It's quite... It's very big. That's not the way of thing.
00:42:55,00:42:56,It's full of water. That's not the way of thing either.
00:42:56,00:42:59,"Well, it's in Antarctica, so being full of water is unusual."
00:42:59,00:43:01,Exactly. That is the way of thing.
00:43:01,00:43:03,And it's because of what this water is like.
00:43:03,00:43:08,"It's really dense and really syrupy, and it's full of calcium chloride."
00:43:08,00:43:10,"It's kind of salt, right?"
00:43:10,00:43:14,"And the water remains liquid, even 50 degrees below freezing."
00:43:14,00:43:17,Even 50 Celsius below zero.
00:43:17,00:43:20,What's that all about?
00:43:20,00:43:22,"Well, it's because it's the most salty body of water in the world, isn't it?"
00:43:22,00:43:24,Exactly. And they don't know where the water comes from.
00:43:24,00:43:26,"I read an interview with a scientist who said,"
00:43:26,00:43:27,"""We've been studying it for 60 years."
00:43:27,00:43:30,"We're pretty sure it's fed from beneath, but we're not totally certain."""
00:43:30,00:43:36,And what does the cold feel like if it's gone beyond the point of where it freezes into a block?
00:43:36,00:43:37,"Oh, I imagine it's very cold."
00:43:37,00:43:37,"I bet, right?"
00:43:37,00:43:39,Yeah.
00:43:39,00:43:41,You need a wet season.
00:43:41,00:43:44,"Well, let's say you're swimming in regular water."
00:43:44,00:43:46,"It freezes, right? So you can't dive into it."
00:43:46,00:43:47,"It's a nice block. You can't get in there, right?"
00:43:47,00:43:49,"Yes. I know what you mean, but you will have been outside"
00:43:49,00:43:51,in the air temperatures lower than zero.
00:43:51,00:43:52,"Yeah, but... Oh, yeah."
00:43:52,00:43:56,"No, I'm just curious what water, just the feeling, the sensation of the..."
00:43:56,00:43:58,"It's really, really cold."
00:43:58,00:44:00,I think it's just the only way anyone can...
00:44:00,00:44:01,I don't think anyone...
00:44:01,00:44:04,"But no one must have ever jumped into this pond, because they would have died."
00:44:04,00:44:04,There we go.
00:44:04,00:44:08,Here's what's interesting about that thing is you would be able to lie down in there
00:44:08,00:44:12,"and read a newspaper like in the Dead Sea, because it's so salty, I guess."
00:44:12,00:44:15,"Oh, because you float right on top of it."
00:44:15,00:44:16,"Yeah, yeah, you wouldn't sink."
00:44:16,00:44:19,Could you concentrate on what you were reading for how fucking cold it is?
00:44:19,00:44:25,Some trickier Guardian articles might be able to stretch.
00:44:25,00:44:27,"Like the long read, you wouldn't get through."
00:44:27,00:44:30,"That's some quick bites in the sun, it'd probably be fine."
00:44:30,00:44:32,"You know Vespasian, the Roman emperor?"
00:44:32,00:44:37,"He heard about the Dead Sea, and he heard that people just float in it,"
00:44:37,00:44:40,"but he didn't believe it, and he didn't want to try it himself,"
00:44:40,00:44:43,so he just got prisoners thrown into it to see what would happen.
00:44:43,00:44:44,"Oh, wow."
00:44:44,00:44:45,And they floated.
00:44:45,00:44:46,"They floated, yeah."
00:44:46,00:44:49,"I will say, in case you're just going to book a trip,"
00:44:49,00:44:52,"that probably don't A, right now, but B,"
00:44:52,00:44:54,"in case you were going to book a trip to the Dead Sea to float, disappointing."
00:44:55,00:44:55,And a sank.
00:44:55,00:44:58,That was quite sinky.
00:44:58,00:44:59,It's a nice review.
00:44:59,00:45:00,One star sank.
00:45:00,00:45:03,You had a big lunch.
00:45:03,00:45:15,"Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show, and that is James."
00:45:15,00:45:18,"Okay, my fact this week is that in 1912,"
00:45:18,00:45:22,the woman with the most perfect feet in America was devast
00:45:22,00:45:25,because her husband was jealous of all the attention she was getting.
00:45:25,00:45:27,Really?
00:45:27,00:45:28,It's relatable.
00:45:28,00:45:30,"James, can I just say?"
00:45:30,00:45:32,Is that because you got such amazing feet?
00:45:32,00:45:34,Or because you want to deposit your mind?
00:45:34,00:45:39,"Can I just say, James, this was an impossible fact to research."
00:45:39,00:45:43,"When you Google ""nice feet"" or ""perfect feet"" in America,"
00:45:43,00:45:46,"oh my goodness, there's a lot of stuff to get through first,"
00:45:46,00:45:48,before you find out about--
00:45:48,00:45:48,"Yeah, he had--"
00:45:48,00:45:50,Tell us about this woman.
00:45:50,00:45:52,"Well, she just had really nice feet."
00:45:52,00:45:57,"It was a stunt by the Caropedists of the USA to find the perfect foot,"
00:45:57,00:46:01,and they eventually managed to find it on the end of a leg
00:46:01,00:46:04,"of a woman called Miss Clara Smith Houston,"
00:46:04,00:46:07,who coincidentally was also a Caropedist.
00:46:07,00:46:07,Yeah.
00:46:07,00:46:08,"Anyway, so--"
00:46:08,00:46:09,Suspects.
00:46:09,00:46:10,"Feels a bit rigged to me, doesn't it?"
00:46:10,00:46:11,It does feel a bit rigged.
00:46:11,00:46:12,I don't know.
00:46:12,00:46:14,You might get into an industry because your feet are so nice.
00:46:14,00:46:16,People have complimented you your whole life.
00:46:16,00:46:18,"They thought, yeah."
00:46:18,00:46:21,"Well, anyway, this story made it into some newspapers,"
00:46:21,00:46:23,just as the Caropedists had hoped.
00:46:23,00:46:27,"But the husband of Miss Smith Houston was not impressed,"
00:46:27,00:46:31,"and he sent her a telegram, like really divorced by text,"
00:46:31,00:46:34,"saying ""friend, wife,"" not a great start."
00:46:34,00:46:39,"""Congratulations on putting your best foot forward."""
00:46:39,00:46:40,Nice pun.
00:46:40,00:46:42,"""Nothing like notoriety, no matter how cheap."""
00:46:42,00:46:47,"""Send your picture to the Pink Journals and call on me for cash,"
00:46:47,00:46:52,"with which to advertise yourself further, full stop, your husband, full stop."""
00:46:52,00:46:56,And then Clara was later quoted in another newspaper saying
00:46:56,00:46:58,"that she decided if a man was so jealous,"
00:46:58,00:47:01,"he would not even allow me to boast of a perfect foot,"
00:47:01,00:47:03,then I best give him up and all the luxuries
00:47:03,00:47:05,with which he provided me.
00:47:05,00:47:08,"Except the one thing, happiness."
00:47:08,00:47:11,"Here, here, here, here, Clara Houston."
00:47:11,00:47:12,I agree.
00:47:12,00:47:12,I get the luxuries.
00:47:12,00:47:13,Can I just--
00:47:13,00:47:16,"So his message, when he's saying advertise yourself in a newspaper,"
00:47:16,00:47:18,is he saying 'cause you're single now?
00:47:18,00:47:20,"What's that second, what's that look?"
00:47:20,00:47:21,I think he's saying just 'cause it's--
00:47:21,00:47:22,"Oh, you're now a foot person, are you?"
00:47:22,00:47:24,"You know, you're now just sort of like trading on your feet."
00:47:24,00:47:27,I think he was also implying that she was living off his money.
00:47:27,00:47:31,"And he was like, ""Well, if you want more money,"
00:47:31,00:47:34,"just to advertise yourself to the world for your awesome feet,"
00:47:34,00:47:37,"then fine, full stop, your husband, full stop."""
00:47:37,00:47:39,Those agro-full stops.
00:47:39,00:47:41,"So the question here is, what is the perfect foot?"
00:47:41,00:47:42,What did Clara have?
00:47:42,00:47:44,And she had--
00:47:44,00:47:44,Seven toes.
00:47:45,00:47:46,She had seven toes.
00:47:46,00:47:47,I guess having seven toes.
00:47:47,00:47:52,So she had nine inches.
00:47:52,00:47:53,They were nine inches long.
00:47:53,00:47:55,"Do you know what size that is, though?"
00:47:55,00:47:56,I just know.
00:47:56,00:47:58,I've just read it from this.
00:47:58,00:47:59,"So you've just written down nine inches,"
00:47:59,00:48:01,"but you don't know how big or small that is,"
00:48:01,00:48:02,presumably for a woman's foot.
00:48:02,00:48:02,'Cause I don't know--
00:48:02,00:48:04,At least Dan goes into the shoe shop
00:48:04,00:48:07,"and he says, ""I reject your size existence."
00:48:07,00:48:09,I'm going to give you an inches.
00:48:09,00:48:10,"You can work it out."""
00:48:10,00:48:13,"256 barley corns, my good Dan."
00:48:13,00:48:20,"I'd like a shoe that's about the size of a glass,"
00:48:20,00:48:21,which I dragged from the other day.
00:48:21,00:48:26,I want a shoe that doesn't fit in James' con.
00:48:26,00:48:33,"Well, for the listener, it's size 3.5, which is fairly small."
00:48:33,00:48:34,And what is the--
00:48:34,00:48:37,Why is it saying 10 inches around the instep?
00:48:37,00:48:39,"The circumference, I suppose."
00:48:39,00:48:39,Yes.
00:48:39,00:48:40,OK.
00:48:40,00:48:40,Nice.
00:48:40,00:48:42,"So very small feet, 3.5."
00:48:42,00:48:44,"I mean, not freakishly small."
00:48:44,00:48:46,"No, but that is small."
00:48:46,00:48:50,It's exactly 1/7th her height in accordance
00:48:50,00:48:52,with the Greek rule of sculpture.
00:48:52,00:48:53,"Oh, that's interesting."
00:48:53,00:48:53,Yeah.
00:48:53,00:48:54,OK.
00:48:54,00:48:57,"This is from the Day Book, where this was all published."
00:48:57,00:48:59,"And it's an amazing blog, by the way, that you found, James."
00:48:59,00:49:00,Yes.
00:49:00,00:49:00,Second Glance History.
00:49:00,00:49:02,"Yeah, it's absolutely brilliant."
00:49:02,00:49:03,"And it was really nice,"
00:49:03,00:49:05,'cause they had the cuttings of all the newspapers and stuff.
00:49:05,00:49:06,Yeah.
00:49:06,00:49:07,So I didn't have to go digging for them myself.
00:49:10,00:49:14,"And then they found that there was a new perfect foot found in 1916,"
00:49:14,00:49:16,which belonged to a nine-year-old girl called Mary Boca.
00:49:16,00:49:20,This was found in Chicago.
00:49:20,00:49:23,"And Mary's mom said, ""Mary had very pretty feet when she was a baby."
00:49:23,00:49:26,I felt nature's gift must not be marred.
00:49:26,00:49:28,I began massaging her feet with cold cream
00:49:28,00:49:30,to make them strong and smooth
00:49:30,00:49:33,"and rubbed them carefully to preserve the natural outline."""
00:49:33,00:49:34,Yeah.
00:49:34,00:49:36,And so her mom realized when she was really young
00:49:36,00:49:37,that she had really nice feet
00:49:37,00:49:39,and then put special stockings on her
00:49:39,00:49:41,so that she didn't damage the feet and all that kind of stuff.
00:49:41,00:49:43,"It's like the William Sisters' dad, isn't it?"
00:49:43,00:49:47,I bet they made a Hollywood film about her in the '30s.
00:49:47,00:49:49,I just don't get the whole feet thing.
00:49:49,00:49:51,I know lots of people really like feet.
00:49:51,00:49:52,"20% of men, I believe."
00:49:52,00:49:54,Only 3% of them.
00:49:54,00:49:55,20% of straight men.
00:49:55,00:49:55,I think it was that.
00:49:55,00:49:56,Or maybe it was 10%.
00:49:56,00:49:57,"What do you mean, really?"
00:49:57,00:49:58,I feel like I...
00:49:58,00:49:59,Fetishize.
00:49:59,00:49:59,"Right, okay."
00:49:59,00:50:00,"Oh, really?"
00:50:00,00:50:02,'Cause there's a website called wikifeet.
00:50:02,00:50:03,"Oh, yeah."
00:50:03,00:50:06,It features a great number of feet.
00:50:06,00:50:08,Features greatly in your search history after this week.
00:50:08,00:50:09,It does now.
00:50:09,00:50:12,There are only three rules on wikifeet.
00:50:12,00:50:14,Only five toes.
00:50:14,00:50:20,The rules change constantly.
00:50:20,00:50:22,Updating their feet.
00:50:22,00:50:25,"No, so you have to be..."
00:50:25,00:50:28,It's normally people posting pictures of women's feet.
00:50:28,00:50:31,I don't think the men section on wikifeet is enormous.
00:50:31,00:50:34,It's sort of women over 17 who are listed on IMDb.
00:50:34,00:50:35,So you have to be in the public eye somehow.
00:50:36,00:50:38,No copyright breaches and no adult content.
00:50:38,00:50:41,But there are people who complain a lot.
00:50:41,00:50:43,They get in rouse with each other on wikifeet.
00:50:43,00:50:46,They'll post on a photo NFS.
00:50:46,00:50:47,Which means no feet showing.
00:50:47,00:50:48,Which is a point.
00:50:48,00:50:49,"I know it is, yeah."
00:50:49,00:50:50,That is weird.
00:50:50,00:50:52,But I think if it's if someone's wearing...
00:50:52,00:50:53,Maybe if you've got a welly on.
00:50:53,00:50:55,This is pointless to me.
00:50:55,00:50:57,"I think if you've got a welly on, you're on the right side."
00:50:57,00:51:00,My friend has a page.
00:51:00,00:51:01,It's a mutual friend.
00:51:01,00:51:02,"I won't say her name, though,"
00:51:02,00:51:03,'cause it is a bit of a weird site.
00:51:03,00:51:05,But she has a page on there.
00:51:05,00:51:07,And it has ratings.
00:51:07,00:51:08,So she has three out of five.
00:51:08,00:51:09,Three.
00:51:09,00:51:10,"Yeah, which is okay."
00:51:10,00:51:11,She's got okay feet.
00:51:11,00:51:12,"You wouldn't get in the Uber, would you?"
00:51:12,00:51:13,If I had a three out of five.
00:51:13,00:51:16,I think it's a bit...
00:51:16,00:51:18,"I mean, obviously it's pretty odd stuff."
00:51:18,00:51:20,"And I think you can, if you say,"
00:51:20,00:51:22,"take my pictures off this website, they do."
00:51:22,00:51:23,"Yeah, okay."
00:51:23,00:51:24,"Yeah, they seem quite nice."
00:51:24,00:51:26,There was a journalist who writes for the...
00:51:26,00:51:27,"Well, I read an article in the cut anyway."
00:51:27,00:51:29,So she writes for the cut and all the other things.
00:51:29,00:51:31,"And she was going out with someone who said,"
00:51:31,00:51:33,"""Hey, do you know you're on wikifeet?"""
00:51:33,00:51:35,"And she said, ""No, I don't."""
00:51:35,00:51:38,And so saw that she had indeed been uploaded.
00:51:38,00:51:39,Her feet had been uploaded
00:51:39,00:51:41,"'cause they get it off like public Instagram pages,"
00:51:41,00:51:42,for instance.
00:51:42,00:51:44,So they were pictures of her on the beach on Instagram
00:51:44,00:51:45,and someone's taken her feet.
00:51:45,00:51:48,"And she said, ""Okay, I'll get in touch."""
00:51:48,00:51:50,So she got in touch with the person.
00:51:50,00:51:53,And so she interviewed this guy who posted her feet.
00:51:53,00:51:55,"And she was very fair, I have to say."
00:51:55,00:51:57,And I thought he did seem a bit odd.
00:51:57,00:52:00,"And she did say at one point,"
00:52:00,00:52:02,"""I've noticed that sometimes within 10 minutes"
00:52:02,00:52:04,"""of me posting an Instagram story that shows my feet,"
00:52:04,00:52:06,"""the screenshot is up on wikifeet."
00:52:06,00:52:08,"""How does that happen?"""
00:52:08,00:52:10,"And he said, ""Look, I don't just sit there looking for it."
00:52:10,00:52:12,"""If I happen to see it and I like it, I'll put it on there."
00:52:12,00:52:14,"""But I'm not sitting there all day and staring."""
00:52:14,00:52:17,"It's like, it sort of started off quite nice."
00:52:17,00:52:19,"And then he obviously, you know,"
00:52:19,00:52:21,he kept on saying what beautiful feet she had.
00:52:21,00:52:24,- I read an article that said that the incidence
00:52:24,00:52:28,of fetishism increases as a response to epidemics
00:52:28,00:52:30,of sexually transmitted diseases in history.
00:52:30,00:52:32,- Interesting.
00:52:32,00:52:36,This was a guy called Dr. James Giannini
00:52:36,00:52:38,and his colleagues who did the study.
00:52:38,00:52:41,And they look back as far back as the 12th century.
00:52:41,00:52:44,"And they found that when there was a spike in STIs,"
00:52:44,00:52:45,people preferred feet.
00:52:45,00:52:48,And it might have been that they were just less interested
00:52:48,00:52:50,in penetrative sex because they might get diseases.
00:52:50,00:52:53,- So your feet are a bit safer to fancy?
00:52:53,00:52:54,- I guess so.
00:52:54,00:52:55,- Yeah.
00:52:55,00:52:57,- Because what's the worst you can get?
00:52:57,00:52:58,Athlete's cock on your cock.
00:52:58,00:52:59,(laughing)
00:52:59,00:53:00,- Athlete's cock.
00:53:00,00:53:01,- Yeah.
00:53:01,00:53:03,- And then they went all the way up to the 80s
00:53:03,00:53:05,and they found even in the AIDS epidemic
00:53:05,00:53:08,"that when that happened, then the numbers of foot oriented"
00:53:08,00:53:11,and foot fetish pictures in kind of porn magazines
00:53:11,00:53:12,and stuff shot up there.
00:53:12,00:53:14,"Because yeah, so preservation, I guess."
00:53:14,00:53:16,"People are thinking, well, where else can I go?"
00:53:16,00:53:18,- Can I tell you about Hogan Fukunaga?
00:53:18,00:53:19,- Yeah.
00:53:19,00:53:21,- He was arrested in the year 2000.
00:53:21,00:53:22,- Oh no.
00:53:22,00:53:22,- I know.
00:53:22,00:53:24,Along with 11 acolytes.
00:53:24,00:53:26,"That's a bad start, isn't it?"
00:53:26,00:53:26,(laughing)
00:53:26,00:53:28,When you and your acolytes have been picked up.
00:53:28,00:53:30,(laughing)
00:53:30,00:53:33,- So he was the head of a cult in Japan
00:53:33,00:53:36,which offered followers analysis of their spiritual
00:53:36,00:53:39,and mental health entirely based on their toes.
00:53:39,00:53:39,- Right.
00:53:39,00:53:43,- So followers would pay 600 quid to have their feet stroked
00:53:43,00:53:46,and then looked at by Mr. Fukunaga.
00:53:46,00:53:48,- Consenting adults.
00:53:48,00:53:53,- Consenting adults with more money than sense.
00:53:53,00:53:56,"And no, consenting adults with maybe too much money"
00:53:56,00:53:58,on their hands and who fell for the story
00:53:58,00:54:01,"that, oh, I can predict your future through your toes."
00:54:01,00:54:03,"- It's like a pedicure cum fortune teller, right?"
00:54:03,00:54:06,"- Yeah, it's like cross my foot with silver."
00:54:06,00:54:07,(laughing)
00:54:07,00:54:10,The predictions were all very suffering based.
00:54:10,00:54:12,"They predicted, oh, you'll die of a horrible disease"
00:54:12,00:54:13,or you'll fall into debt.
00:54:13,00:54:15,So that wasn't nice.
00:54:15,00:54:17,But you can avert your problems if you sign up
00:54:17,00:54:18,for one of our lecture courses
00:54:18,00:54:20,or if you buy a pinch of Buddha's ashes
00:54:20,00:54:23,"at a mere 120,000 pounds."
00:54:23,00:54:24,- Okay.
00:54:24,00:54:25,- They were running this cult for about 15 years.
00:54:25,00:54:28,They made 500 million quid out of it.
00:54:28,00:54:28,- Wow.
00:54:28,00:54:29,- Yeah.
00:54:29,00:54:31,And then he claimed later on
00:54:31,00:54:32,that he had been simply obeying the voice of heaven
00:54:32,00:54:35,but that he had since forgotten what the voice had said.
00:54:35,00:54:36,(laughing)
00:54:36,00:54:37,"- RIP a lot of people off, maybe."
00:54:37,00:54:38,- I think so.
00:54:38,00:54:40,- It feels like in this cult being called
00:54:40,00:54:41,the head of the operation is the wrong title.
00:54:41,00:54:43,(laughing)
00:54:43,00:54:44,That should be the junior role.
00:54:44,00:54:46,"- Yeah, you're absolutely right."
00:54:46,00:54:47,"- Yeah, he was the big toe."
00:54:47,00:54:50,"When you have an enormous interest in feet,"
00:54:50,00:54:52,"I believe it's called podophilia,"
00:54:52,00:54:55,which means there is a word that should be coined
00:54:55,00:54:57,for people who have an abnormal interest in podcasts.
00:54:57,00:55:00,"So when I have Harkin's podcast,"
00:55:00,00:55:03,you might have Andy's podophile cast.
00:55:03,00:55:04,"- No, I'm saying that-"
00:55:04,00:55:06,- Would all your acolytes be called podophiles?
00:55:06,00:55:09,(laughing)
00:55:09,00:55:10,You can get badges made.
00:55:10,00:55:12,(laughing)
00:55:12,00:55:16,"- I'm a podophile, I shouted the mob out like my house."
00:55:16,00:55:18,(laughing)
00:55:18,00:55:22,"- No, but there should be a word for people"
00:55:22,00:55:23,who like podcast lots
00:55:23,00:55:25,"because podophile is taken by the feet people, right?"
00:55:25,00:55:26,- Let's call them feetophiles.
00:55:26,00:55:27,- Yes.
00:55:27,00:55:29,- We'll take their word back.
00:55:29,00:55:31,"- But you know, there should be something."
00:55:31,00:55:32,- Audio file.
00:55:32,00:55:33,"- Audio file, that's good,"
00:55:33,00:55:36,but it's quite confusing 'cause it's also an audio file.
00:55:36,00:55:37,- Yeah.
00:55:37,00:55:39,"- Oh, that's what makes it so perfect."
00:55:39,00:55:42,"Sorry, it's actually better than a confusing, yeah, yeah."
00:55:42,00:55:43,- Yeah.
00:55:43,00:55:48,- So famous names who love a foot include Elvis.
00:55:48,00:55:50,- Are we really doing this?
00:55:50,00:55:51,- We're really doing.
00:55:51,00:55:52,- There's a lot of people who have admitted
00:55:52,00:55:55,to loving feet and having been a feet.
00:55:55,00:55:57,"- It's quite, it's just quite a turn for us, isn't it?"
00:55:57,00:55:58,Like celebrity toe suckers.
00:55:58,00:55:59,- Yeah.
00:55:59,00:56:02,- Apparently the podcast is now about.
00:56:02,00:56:04,"- It was a story, but apparently Elvis really loved it."
00:56:04,00:56:06,What's interesting is there is obviously
00:56:06,00:56:08,"quite a lot of famous stories about, you know,"
00:56:08,00:56:10,his henchmen would go out into a crown after a gig.
00:56:10,00:56:13,- Good henchmen and cut off people's feet.
00:56:13,00:56:14,(laughing)
00:56:14,00:56:16,- And they would bring them back to the volcano
00:56:16,00:56:18,where the Elvis had his Graceland.
00:56:18,00:56:20,"- His foot soldiers, yeah, they would go out."
00:56:20,00:56:22,"- And they would, so they would, you know, go,"
00:56:22,00:56:24,"you, you, do you want to come meet Elvis?"
00:56:24,00:56:25,"And obviously it was, you know,"
00:56:25,00:56:27,to bring women backstage.
00:56:27,00:56:29,And apparently they screened their feet.
00:56:29,00:56:30,"Is, is what is up with that?"
00:56:30,00:56:33,- Were they crawling around on the floor in the gig?
00:56:33,00:56:34,Just looking for feet.
00:56:34,00:56:36,(laughing)
00:56:36,00:56:37,- I dropped an earring.
00:56:37,00:56:39,Presumably most women went to the gigs wearing shoes.
00:56:39,00:56:41,How are they doing that?
00:56:41,00:56:43,"- Don't, I, I, you know, it's just a rumor."
00:56:43,00:56:45,"- What, it's just a rumor?"
00:56:45,00:56:48,"- We know that he loved feet and the, the story is,"
00:56:48,00:56:49,"is that that was part of what it, you know,"
00:56:49,00:56:52,the screening is what would go on and I'm lucky.
00:56:52,00:56:52,- Story is.
00:56:52,00:56:56,"- Can I, can I steer us back towards karma waters?"
00:56:56,00:56:57,- Sure.
00:56:57,00:56:58,- I think about corns.
00:56:58,00:57:01,"You know, you get corns on your feet."
00:57:01,00:57:01,- Yeah.
00:57:01,00:57:02,"- Oh, okay, yeah, yeah."
00:57:02,00:57:04,"- Can, can you, can they transfer to your pain?"
00:57:04,00:57:06,(laughing)
00:57:06,00:57:08,I don't believe so.
00:57:08,00:57:09,- Cock corn.
00:57:09,00:57:12,"- But they used to, it used to have street corn cutters,"
00:57:12,00:57:13,right?
00:57:13,00:57:13,That was the thing.
00:57:13,00:57:14,"- Oh God, really?"
00:57:14,00:57:15,- Yeah.
00:57:15,00:57:17,"I mean, it was, you know, it's sort of pretty,"
00:57:17,00:57:18,"and it's, it's obviously, if you have corns,"
00:57:18,00:57:19,they're really painful.
00:57:19,00:57:20,- What would you do?
00:57:20,00:57:22,"- Like filing a nail, like that kind of material."
00:57:22,00:57:23,"- All sorts of procedures, basically."
00:57:23,00:57:25,"- But the weird thing is, I just like this,"
00:57:25,00:57:27,"I was on the blog Foot Talk,"
00:57:27,00:57:30,which is another great foot based blog.
00:57:30,00:57:31,- Oh yeah.
00:57:31,00:57:32,- I really recommend it.
00:57:32,00:57:33,But there used to be jingles.
00:57:33,00:57:35,They would advertise themselves by singing jingles
00:57:35,00:57:36,in the streets.
00:57:36,00:57:37,And the weird thing about this is that sometimes
00:57:37,00:57:42,celebrity composers would write jingles for corn cutters.
00:57:42,00:57:43,- Really?
00:57:43,00:57:44,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:57:44,00:57:45,- Like how celebrity are we talking?
00:57:45,00:57:46,"Mozart's, God is."
00:57:46,00:57:47,- Well.
00:57:47,00:57:48,- Irving Berlin.
00:57:48,00:57:49,- I'm gonna say the name Orlando Gibbons.
00:57:49,00:57:50,- Oh yeah?
00:57:50,00:57:51,- Oh my God.
00:57:51,00:57:52,- Yeah.
00:57:52,00:57:53,- Not Orlando.
00:57:53,00:57:55,"- Wait, I mean, so he."
00:57:55,00:57:57,- Wow.
00:57:57,00:57:58,- He was famous at the time.
00:57:58,00:58:00,"He, you know, he was the organist at Westminster Abbey."
00:58:00,00:58:02,He was eventually named Virginalist to the King.
00:58:02,00:58:05,(all laughing)
00:58:05,00:58:08,"- That was a storm, he was kind of like that, wasn't it?"
00:58:08,00:58:11,"- A virtual being, a kind of piano, obviously."
00:58:11,00:58:14,- Do we have the song then?
00:58:14,00:58:15,The jingle one?
00:58:15,00:58:17,"- Sadly, I don't think we do."
00:58:17,00:58:19,They're pretty sure that he came up with jingles
00:58:19,00:58:21,"for corn cutters as well, as a kind of sideline."
00:58:21,00:58:23,I don't know if it was lucrative or something to do.
00:58:23,00:58:24,- You guys are just reminding me.
00:58:24,00:58:28,"Wilf, my son, he used to love corn on the cob,"
00:58:28,00:58:30,but he always used to call it corn on the cock.
00:58:30,00:58:32,That was the phrase that he used.
00:58:32,00:58:34,- Can I tell you something about horses feet?
00:58:34,00:58:35,- Yeah.
00:58:35,00:58:36,- Which I love.
00:58:36,00:58:40,Is that horses feet are always giving you a middle finger.
00:58:40,00:58:41,One big middle finger.
00:58:41,00:58:44,Every horse's hoof is what we call a horse's foot.
00:58:44,00:58:46,It's just a big middle finger.
00:58:46,00:58:50,And this is because they once had five toes on their feet.
00:58:50,00:58:52,"Many, many, many years ago."
00:58:52,00:58:54,There are actually kind of three of them still visible
00:58:54,00:58:55,'cause you've got two little vestigial ones.
00:58:55,00:58:56,"If you know, horse's legs,"
00:58:56,00:58:58,they're kind of a bit out of the leg.
00:58:58,00:59:01,But the hoof is just the middle finger.
00:59:01,00:59:04,And there's actually a biologist called Catherine Cavana
00:59:04,00:59:07,who recently was sorting through preserved horse embryos
00:59:07,00:59:09,for reasons she didn't go into.
00:59:09,00:59:12,"And she saw that in the very, very early days"
00:59:12,00:59:15,"of horse gestation, they have five fingers"
00:59:15,00:59:16,on each foot.
00:59:16,00:59:17,- Wow.
00:59:17,00:59:19,- And then you see it in the cells
00:59:19,00:59:20,and it's like they're about to grow
00:59:20,00:59:21,and then they decide not to grow
00:59:21,00:59:22,because they've evolved out of it.
00:59:22,00:59:24,- So let me ask you this.
00:59:24,00:59:27,"If a horse with five toes rocks up to the Grand National,"
00:59:27,00:59:28,are there regulations to say?
00:59:28,00:59:29,- No rules against it.
00:59:29,00:59:30,No rules against it.
00:59:30,00:59:31,"- No rules, no rules."
00:59:31,00:59:32,And it's five times faster.
00:59:32,00:59:34,"- Yeah, ridden by a crocodile."
00:59:34,00:59:36,(laughing)
00:59:36,00:59:39,You know that the women of Chicago
00:59:39,00:59:41,have been famous throughout America
00:59:41,00:59:43,for abnormally sized feet.
00:59:43,00:59:44,- Big or small?
00:59:44,00:59:45,- Big.
00:59:45,00:59:46,- Okay.
00:59:46,00:59:47,- In the early 20th century.
00:59:47,00:59:50,"So this perfect foot, the second one was in Chicago."
00:59:50,00:59:51,And everyone was surprised
00:59:51,00:59:54,because people in Chicago usually have massive feet.
00:59:54,00:59:55,- What a funny key shape to have about it.
00:59:55,00:59:56,- It's amazing.
00:59:56,00:59:57,And I looked in the newspaper archives
00:59:57,01:00:00,"and sure enough, if you look like before, you know,"
01:00:00,01:00:02,"the 20s and so it's for big feet Chicago,"
01:00:02,01:00:04,"there's all these articles are going,"
01:00:04,01:00:05,"""Yeah, they all got big feet."""
01:00:05,01:00:07,"And then you get people in Chicago saying,"
01:00:07,01:00:08,"""Yeah, we do have big feet,"
01:00:08,01:00:11,"but actually that also means we have big intellect."""
01:00:11,01:00:11,- Wow.
01:00:11,01:00:12,"- Yeah, sure it does."
01:00:12,01:00:14,- Is it just the women or is it the people in Chicago?
01:00:14,01:00:15,- It's the women of Chicago.
01:00:15,01:00:17,- Is it so that they can like walk out
01:00:17,01:00:19,over the Great Lakes and distribute their weight better?
01:00:19,01:00:21,"- Oh, that would be good, yeah."
01:00:21,01:00:23,"- I thought maybe 'cause it's the windy city, isn't it?"
01:00:23,01:00:25,And it would help you not to get blown over.
01:00:25,01:00:25,- Great shouts.
01:00:25,01:00:26,- Yeah.
01:00:26,01:00:28,"- Yeah, it's got all these uses."
01:00:28,01:00:29,- That's evolution.
01:00:29,01:00:30,- That is such funny.
01:00:30,01:00:31,Is there any evidence behind it?
01:00:31,01:00:32,"As it is, is it true?"
01:00:32,01:00:33,"- No, I can't be true."
01:00:33,01:00:35,"I mean, I'll be honest, I haven't gone to Chicago"
01:00:35,01:00:37,and measured all the women's feet.
01:00:37,01:00:38,But it can't be true.
01:00:38,01:00:39,- Get Elvis's henchmen to go and do it.
01:00:39,01:00:41,(laughing)
01:00:41,01:00:44,(upbeat music)
01:00:44,01:00:46,(upbeat music)
01:00:46,01:00:49,"- Okay, that's it."
