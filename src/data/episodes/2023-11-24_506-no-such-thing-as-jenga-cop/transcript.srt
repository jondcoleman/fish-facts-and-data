00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,920
 Hi everyone. Just before we started this show, we wanted to remind you of something that you

2
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:11,520
 should already be well aware of, which is that our esteemed colleagues and co-podcasters,

3
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:18,080
 Dan Treiber and Andrew Hunter Murray, have both written books and they are truly fantastic books.

4
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:24,320
 So, if you have anyone in your life who is a fish fan, who, God forbid, thinks that Dan and Andy

5
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:30,960
 are the superior half of fish, perhaps that person is you, then why not get them for Christmas,

6
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:37,360
 a book by Dan and a book by Andy. Dan has written the theory of everything else and honestly, when

7
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:42,800
 I read it, on every page, I thought, "How have you been hogging these facts for this book rather

8
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:47,440
 than sharing them on the podcast?" It is so selfish, but it's made for a brilliant book,

9
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:54,000
 stunning revelations on every page. Andy has written the last day and the sanctuary. They're

10
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,320
 both thrillers. They're real page turners. They're a fantastic twist and turns and of course,

11
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:04,560
 they're making some very intelligent points about society today. So, get both of those for

12
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:09,600
 anyone you know who's a big fan of Dan and Andy. But Anna, what if the people listening to this

13
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:14,240
 prefer this half of the podcast, the James and Anna half of the podcast? What are those people

14
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:20,640
 going to do? Oh, you mean the 95 other percent of our listeners. Oh, I don't know, James. Have we

15
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:25,040
 done anything interesting lately? We have indeed. I don't know if you recall, because it was before

16
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:30,640
 you went on maternity leave, but we wrote a book called "Everything to Play for the QI Book of Sports"

17
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:36,400
 and it is another book that is jammed full of facts. Do you know why ancient Egyptian athletes

18
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:42,880
 removed their spleens? Why pool balls no longer explode on impact? How bum slapping improves

19
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:48,880
 team performance? All that and more, you can learn in our book, which is called "Everything to Play for

20
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:56,000
 the QI Book of Sports". But the truth is, if you or anyone you know is a big fish fan, these are

21
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,880
 the perfect things to get them for Christmas. Who doesn't love opening a present at Christmas

22
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:10,240
 and getting a good old book that they can read? Read. If you too like to do this strange reading

23
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:16,320
 thing that Anna does, then go to Noticesthinkasafish.com/books and you'll be able to find all the

24
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:21,120
 details of those three books, but they're available wherever you buy your books. Get them all, get

25
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:27,200
 them for everyone you know for Christmas. Get them now. On with the show. On with the podcast.

26
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:49,040
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming to you

27
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:54,960
 from the QI offices in Hobart. My name is Dad Shriver. I am sitting here with James Harkin,

28
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:59,360
 Andrew Hunter Murray and Anna Tyshinski. And once again, we have gathered around the microphones

29
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:05,040
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days. And in a particular order here we go. Starting

30
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:12,400
 with fact number one, that is Anna. My fact this week is that your brain contains a tender mother,

31
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:17,680
 a tough mother and a spider mother. Is that just Dan we're talking about here?

32
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:24,800
 Yeah, and it explains everything. It does. Are these like multiple personality traits of like I

33
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:28,640
 have a tough mother that comes, is that the idea of it? Oh, I love that idea. What would the spider

34
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:32,720
 mother be? Well, I assume there's something that they do in the wild where they make webs. I hope

35
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:36,080
 they like eat their children. Yeah, eating each other. The spider mother actually eats the tough

36
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:39,680
 mother and the tender mother. It's actually neither of these things. They're just fun names

37
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:44,560
 for things in the brain. So these are meninges that in your brain and spinal cord. And they're

38
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:49,280
 basically a three layered envelope that protects your brain and spinal cord. And there's a delicate

39
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:54,480
 inner layer, which is called the peer meter, which means sort of tender mother or soft mother

40
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:59,840
 or pious mother. And so that wraps around the brain and spinal cord a bit like cling film.

41
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:04,560
 And then there's a really tough outer layer, which is just under the bone of your skull. And that's

42
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:10,080
 a dura mater, the hard mother, tough mother. And then there's a middle layer, the arachnoid

43
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:15,440
 mater. And that's like a network of tissues and the tissue sort of spread out like a spider's web.

44
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:22,480
 So really, it should be called a spider web mother, but it's not. The meninges is, you know,

45
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:27,440
 a baby at the top of their head, they have like a gap where the skull hasn't covered them up. Oh,

46
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:32,800
 yeah. The meninges is the kind of tough stuff that covers their brain, which means that at least

47
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:36,480
 the brain isn't sticking out of the head. That's interesting. I don't know that. And also that

48
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:40,160
 little hole there, that is what the company baby gap is named after.

49
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:46,160
 I was just looking at sort of things that happen in the brain, unusual processes and things like

50
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:51,760
 that. Yeah, I really like this. Your brain is so fast that you can judge whether someone is

51
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:56,480
 trustworthy or not, even if you haven't seen them consciously. Okay. So they tried this thing where

52
00:04:56,480 --> 00:05:00,320
 they showed people images for it like a fraction of it, like a millisecond, a couple of milliseconds,

53
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:06,000
 right? Too fast for people to consciously register they had seen a face. Yeah. They were either faces

54
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,120
 that were, you know, untrustworthy looking or trustworthy looking or whatever. I don't know

55
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:14,560
 what the criteria were. What is that? Is it like one person they've got, you know, a fag out the

56
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:21,440
 corner of their mouth and a big overcoat on? And a bag-tank swag. Yeah. No, I have no idea. Maybe

57
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:24,640
 they had to assess from people what they found trustworthy or untrustworthy first. Because

58
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:28,000
 some people might only trust people who look like sort of comedy burglars from the 1980s.

59
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:32,560
 But when they showed them those images, even for a fraction of a second, they didn't consciously

60
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:37,120
 see them. But the bit of their brain, the amygdala, which processes strong emotions,

61
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:41,280
 particularly in relation to whether you trust someone or not, fired up. Wow. It's not weird.

62
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:46,400
 Wow. Do you know what the amygdala means? Ormond. Yeah. The brain is just full of

63
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:51,200
 weirdly named stuff because it's like a structure and people could look at it hundreds of years ago

64
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:55,280
 if they took out someone's brain after they died and like name the bits of the structure. It's just

65
00:05:55,280 --> 00:06:01,680
 got all really old fashioned, odd names. Like almond. Seahorse. Indeed. Oh yeah, the seahorse.

66
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:06,320
 Because like if you are looking at someone's brain and you're like, which bit do I need to take out?

67
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:11,600
 And they say, well, it's the blood, blood, fontanelle or whatever. You wouldn't know what it was. But if

68
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:15,520
 you say the seahorse, you can look at it and go, oh, that looks a bit like a seahorse. I'll take

69
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:22,560
 that bit out. Yeah. And the martyr, the pia martyr and the other martyrs, they're named after the

70
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:29,520
 facts that they kind of cover things like a mother might hold her baby. They come from the Arabic.

71
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:32,720
 Wow. I wondered with the speed that you were talking about a second ago, Andy,

72
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:38,400
 the like, I was just thinking a quiz show, right? How quickly does the answer come to you

73
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:42,560
 prior to your finger, the information getting to your finger and you pressing a buzzer, right?

74
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:47,200
 If you were able to hook up your brain to the bit that lights up that says you know the answer,

75
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:51,200
 how quick could it be? Are you pitching a quiz where no one actually asks the questions and

76
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:56,240
 people just buzzing and say, no, no, you need the question. Are you thinking like you're going

77
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:00,720
 university challenge, everyone else is using their fingers like absolute noobs and you've

78
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:03,920
 got something attached to your actual brain. Competitive advantage. You've got your head on

79
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:11,360
 the button. Exactly. That's it. I look like I'm keeled over, but no. Shriver Australia.

80
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:18,080
 The only flaw in your plan is that you actually wouldn't know any of the answers anyway. So

81
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:24,720
 it doesn't matter how you're pressing the button. I've genuinely never got an answer right on a

82
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:28,480
 university challenge. No, I think that's good. But they show you the question for a millisecond

83
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:32,960
 at the part of your brain associated with Turkmenistan fires, then it's actually a team of

84
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:38,400
 neuroscientists who answer the question for you. But like several days later after the analysis.

85
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:43,040
 But is the kind of thing your brain does and mostly I associate this sort of thing with

86
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:49,760
 that, you know, there's that split brain operation that used to be done on epileptic

87
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:54,960
 people. It was like, it was a revolutionary operation. And you basically cut the brain

88
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:58,720
 in half down the corpus callosum, which is a bit that splits the left side from the right side of

89
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:03,840
 the brain. And it was amazing because it stopped people having epileptic fits when nothing else

90
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:09,280
 would work. They did loads of experiments on these people whose two brains were working fine,

91
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:12,880
 but they couldn't communicate with each other. And so the reason I thought, for instance, of that

92
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:18,880
 university challenge thing was that someone who'd had that operation, they would be shown a picture

93
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:24,400
 of a face to their right eye, which goes into the left hemisphere. And they're asked what they've

94
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:29,520
 seen. And they can say face. But if it goes into the other eye and into the opposite hemisphere,

95
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:33,040
 because it's going to the wrong hemisphere that doesn't process language, once they're asked

96
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:37,600
 what they've seen, they can't say face, but they can draw a face. I mean, the language is still

97
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:42,240
 completely fine. But they'll just say, I've got no idea what I've seen. But their hand will draw a

98
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:47,280
 face. Here's my pitch. Yeah. It's a cop drama, right? And there's a witness to a crime, but you

99
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:52,320
 only saw it with one eye, the eye which doesn't know what. But he can draw it. And you've got a

100
00:08:52,320 --> 00:09:00,480
 cop, but he's only got the other eye. Yes. And it's basically Pictionary, Pictionary cop. That's

101
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:05,760
 actually really good. And that can be a sequel to Dictionary cop, which is... Oh, right. I thought

102
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:11,840
 you're going to be like Buckaroo cop, Mousetrap cop. Jenga cop. He's got two hours to stop this

103
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:17,440
 building falling over. Yeah. It's not got any mortar. It's just bricks. But you know, fine.

104
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:22,560
 It's a dry stone building. And one of the bricks has got a bomb in it, but he doesn't know which

105
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:27,200
 one. So he has to keep removing the bricks to find the bomb without the building falling down.

106
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:31,440
 But it's in a very congested area. So he can only put the bricks on top of the building at the top.

107
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:38,560
 This is quite good. Dry stone wall is probably set at the Cotswolds. So he's had some lovely

108
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:44,640
 location filming before the... Yeah, yeah. This is bloody good. Jenga cop. There is just one

109
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:51,760
 other possible spy film, follow up, where you can basically get people to say things that they

110
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:55,280
 don't know they've said, I guess, because there was another guy who'd had his brain cut in half.

111
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:59,840
 And they asked him the question to one side of his brain. They flashed the question,

112
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:04,320
 who's your favourite girlfriend? He was a little boy. Oh, right. Who's your favourite girlfriend?

113
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:07,440
 And then he was asked, do you know what question we've asked you? And he was shrugged and was like,

114
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:12,560
 no, I haven't seen anything. I didn't see anything. But then he giggled, said no,

115
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:16,880
 and then spelled out Liz in Scrabble Tiles with his other hand. How awful is that? You're just

116
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:21,520
 giving stuff away. Scrabble Tiles, 10 points as well for the Zed. He put on a triple hurt score

117
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:27,680
 as well. Well, it makes you a follow up. Scrabble cop. Scrabble cop. That's good.

118
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:31,840
 Have you guys heard of hemmy neglect, which is kind of in the same sphere here? Hemmy neglect.

119
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:36,400
 Hemmy neglect is when this is people who have had a stroke. There's a bit of brain damage that

120
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:42,640
 goes on whereby they only experience basically one side of their visual field. So if they've gone

121
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:47,280
 to shave, they'll shave off half their face, but leave the other side because it's just not

122
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:50,800
 part of their field anymore, right? If they're eating on a plate, they'll eat the right side

123
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:54,320
 or left side of the plate. They'll eat just one side of the plate. So it's not just that you can't

124
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,360
 see presumably, it's that your brain refuses to acknowledge that. Your brain is refusing to

125
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:02,240
 acknowledge that. Yeah. But this is what's amazing. They started looking into hemmy neglect within

126
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:08,160
 memory as well. So they managed to find a group of people where all of them had been to Milan.

127
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:12,320
 So they asked them the exact same thing, you're standing in the major plaza in Milan,

128
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:16,000
 recall as many stores and streets around you as possible in the square,

129
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,800
 and they could only remember the stores and the streets that were on the right side and not the

130
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:24,960
 left. Probably good memories though. He asked me to name a shop, you know, on a square I'd lived on

131
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:29,040
 for about 20 years. I probably couldn't do it. I could name a shop in Milan in the central square

132
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:34,800
 but yeah, because they recently got their first Starbucks and it was some controversy because

133
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:40,400
 obviously Milan, the home of coffee, good coffee, and there was a Starbucks there. It was very nice

134
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:45,040
 Starbucks too. So that prompted a bit of local discussion. Or according to these people, there

135
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:52,720
 was a Bucks. Yeah. All of our brains are smaller than they would have been 3,000 years ago if we'd

136
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:58,000
 been born then. We've lost about four ping pong balls worth of brain. Whoa, that's a lot. It is

137
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:03,600
 quite a lot and it's not exactly clear what caused it because we invented agriculture 10,000 years

138
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:08,480
 ago as a species. It's not that. Writing dates back several thousand years and it might be something

139
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:12,560
 to do with that. It might be that I keep part of my brain in all of your brains.

140
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:18,960
 I wonder what that was. No, but like if you have lots of division of labor and you have a complicated

141
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:22,640
 system, you sort of divide up the cognitive tasks and you need a bit less brain space. Yeah. I think

142
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:27,280
 there is a theory that domestication makes your brain smaller because it works with animals for

143
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:31,600
 sure. So am I domesticated? Well, I think humans are domesticated, aren't we? Well, no, we're the

144
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:36,560
 domesticators. But who's domesticated us, aside from cat, according to some interpretation.

145
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:44,240
 The man. The man. Society has domesticated us. To be fair, I don't think I would thrive in the

146
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:49,680
 wild. I don't think you would either. I concur. Dan, anything to do with you? Do you contradict that

147
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:54,720
 statement? No, I think well, I'm going off getting some berries and Anna's going off killing a wild

148
00:12:54,720 --> 00:13:00,000
 cat. And you are trying to think of some cop dramas. I don't know which of us is going to be the most

149
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:06,000
 useful in the group. In the future, we will need cop dramas to survive. We'll need that hope that

150
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:13,360
 comes from like, will you find the bomb? Yeah. Okay, brain fart. Yeah. Like when you have a moment,

151
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:18,000
 you can't remember something, right? Yeah. Yeah. This podcast has been a 10 year long one, for

152
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:25,360
 instance. Sure. Yeah. What about a brain squared? What is that? Brain squared time. It's where you

153
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:30,160
 try and think of one thing, and it just shoves out tons of different things. It's like, someone

154
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:34,480
 says, what's the capital of Malawi? And all you can think of is every other capital in Africa.

155
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:39,440
 Oh, good. Yes. No, I was saying, yeah, that's probably closer than to mine, which you would be

156
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:46,800
 saying things that sounded right as a ramble. So like a quiz question like that. But you genuinely

157
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:52,640
 went, it's Michael's, no, Sarah, Joey, Chandler, right? Mums do when they're trying to remember

158
00:13:52,640 --> 00:14:01,200
 your name. They always run through, don't they? John, Katie, Claire, Hannah, James, James, come over

159
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:07,040
 here. It's just a feeble or abortive attempt at reasoning, but it dates back to the 1650s.

160
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:12,000
 They're cool. Really? I'm having a brain squirt. It was also, this dates back to Old English,

161
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:18,240
 your brain locker. What is that? Brain locker. Brain locker. It's someone who looks at a brain

162
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:24,480
 in South Africa. It's my brain locker. It's just your head. I was going to say, it's your skull.

163
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:30,480
 My brain locker. My brain locker. Crazy that we had a word for that. It's like one little hack. I was

164
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:34,720
 reading a lot of neuroscientists saying how you can hack your brain to make sure that, so if you're

165
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:38,240
 someone who forgets things a lot, or you have something important that you need to remember,

166
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:42,960
 and you just don't, you can't find it, write it down or anything, take something, take an object,

167
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:46,960
 and just place it somewhere it shouldn't be. So if you're leaving the house, for example,

168
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:52,320
 and you're like, oh, why is this, you know, flute here? Yeah. It'll make you go, ah, yes,

169
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:57,440
 I've been meaning to do that thing. It's a way of associating with a physical object. So that's

170
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:01,360
 just a great hack. I feel like, you know, I do that with my hair bands. I put one hair band on

171
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:04,320
 the other wrist if I need to remember something. I'll be the second one on the other wrist if I

172
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:07,680
 need to remember a second thing. And then I put one back on the first wrist if I need to remember

173
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:21,600
 a third thing. Oh, shit. Okay, it is time for fact number two. And that is my fact. My fact this

174
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:28,400
 week is that at the 1984 US Grand Prix, it was thought that Ayrton Senna crashed into a wall

175
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:35,120
 on the 47th lap. But it turns out it was actually the wall that crashed into him. This is another

176
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:43,440
 case of a Jenga cop, I feel. This is an amazing story. So Senna is one of the greatest Formula

177
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:48,160
 1 drivers ever. His career was cut short, because sadly, 10 years later, he did have a crash in a

178
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:56,480
 Grand Prix, which he died. So basically, he was in this Grand Prix, and he's heading on cutting a

179
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:01,920
 corner, very tight to the wall as he had done on previous laps. He nicks it. So afterwards,

180
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:07,600
 they're talking about it, and he says, "There's no way I hit that wall. I'm a precision driver."

181
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:14,320
 And he was very cocky, Senna. "I'm a precision driver. That wall came into me." So they went out

182
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:18,560
 just because, I guess, you know, they thought, "Well, maybe he's right. Let's check it out." And

183
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:23,680
 they noticed that the wall had moved. And the reason was, is because a car-

184
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:27,680
 Is a human dressed as a wall, wasn't it? Who was hiding from the Jenga cop?

185
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:31,920
 But it was also saying anti-Catholic propaganda at the time, wasn't it?

186
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:40,240
 Cool. Back to last episode, everyone. So basically, these walls were giant,

187
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:45,840
 concrete blocks. And on a previous lap, a car had also hit this wall. And what they'd notice

188
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:50,720
 was that it hit it with such force that it had knocked the back of it. And so the front bit

189
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:58,560
 jutted out a tiny bit, but only by 10 millimeters is what they were saying that he was so precise.

190
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:02,400
 He was so precise that that was enough. He knew exactly where he needed to take it.

191
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:07,680
 And so he nicked the wall. And this is how he is sort of known. He's known as this guy.

192
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:15,040
 He was the best. I believe so. I mean, there's countless arguments in Formula One fans, but

193
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:19,120
 for me, he was the best. There you go. You heard it here first.

194
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:22,880
 So tragically, because he was cut off in his prime, we don't know where he would have taken it to.

195
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:28,080
 He won three world championships. He's been surpassed by Schumacher and others,

196
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:32,480
 but that's because of the longevity of a career. So yeah, hard to know where he would have gone.

197
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:39,360
 I didn't know why it's called Formula One. And it's just the whole point of Formula One is that

198
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:43,840
 there is a formula. And it's this set of rules that you have to adhere to. And they change the

199
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:47,680
 rules every, I don't know, every year or every couple of years. And then everyone has to build

200
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:51,280
 entirely new cars and it's a nightmare. And that is the formula that everyone's complying with.

201
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:54,960
 And that's about the weight and the aerodynamics and the blah, blah, blah. And I used to know,

202
00:17:54,960 --> 00:18:00,560
 what I do know, someone, a friend of mine, used to work on Formula One doing the kind of modelling,

203
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:06,000
 the computer modelling of the aerodynamics of the cars. Basically, you just do that hundreds of

204
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,320
 thousands of times and modelling the airflow over a car to work out what's going to be best.

205
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:15,680
 And then they change the rules and then you have to adjust everything in a fraction of a millimeter

206
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:20,560
 in all of this. It's amazing. And try and push it slightly further than everyone else is pushing it.

207
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:25,360
 Yeah, because there must be one perfect car, theoretically. Oh, right. That would be the,

208
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:30,080
 have the perfect aerodynamics for these rules. I don't know. And they all cross the line at the

209
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:39,680
 same time. That's when you have to bring in some variables like Mario Kart. The Red Shells. The

210
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:49,440
 Benefit. Rainbow Road. A bubble that you drive into. Blop, blop, blop. I mean, it would all liven up

211
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:54,560
 what is sometimes quite a dry sport to watch. It is very, this is, I think, true of quite a lot

212
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:58,880
 of sports, which is if you're not really into them and you watch them, they seem quite boring on the

213
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:02,560
 outside. And then as soon as you start reading about them, it's like, oh my God, this is incredible.

214
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:06,400
 Yeah, that's definitely true of everyone, isn't it? Otherwise, it is just people going round and

215
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:10,480
 round at a thing. But yeah, you can't make the cars too good. And obviously, there are rules to

216
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:14,240
 stop you doing that. Partly for safety, because if you go too fast, it's very bad. And safety has

217
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:19,520
 massively cracked down the last sort of 30 years. But there have been great cars made in the past

218
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:23,280
 that they've had to change the rules to stop happening again, like the six-wheeled car.

219
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:28,320
 Do we have the six-wheeled? Yeah, it's so cool. It's amazing. Was it designed by Homer Simpson?

220
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:35,440
 Yes, it was. No, this was in the 1970s. And it was Tyrell, one of the teams,

221
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:39,840
 raced a six-wheeled car. Realised that there would be an advantage to it, because if you have

222
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:44,000
 four smaller wheels at the front rather than two big wheels, then I think you increase the amount

223
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:50,400
 of contact with the ground. So you've got more grip on the road. More traction on the corners.

224
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:55,360
 Honestly, that is like, they've got someone in from the outside who's never worked in

225
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:59,360
 Formula One before and said, look at this. How can we improve this car? And they've gone,

226
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:04,000
 "More wheels?" Imagine being in that meeting, though. They were looking through it. We've

227
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,000
 looked through the manual 30 times now. There's nothing which says the maximum number of wheels

228
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,320
 is for you. You can do it. That must be something in the rules, something. That must be every other

229
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:16,800
 car ever. They didn't think of putting it in the rules. It's like saying you can't have a crocodile

230
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:22,000
 driving. They didn't think of that. There is no rule about the number of wheels, largely because

231
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,440
 they did this. And at the time, there were various slight problems with it, because they hadn't

232
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:30,000
 perfected the technology yet, because they'd only just invented the six-wheeled car. They did get a

233
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,960
 few podium finishes, I think, for that car. But the FIA banned it in the end, because they worried

234
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:38,480
 that we'd just get to a place where people were putting more and more wheels on cars. You just

235
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:44,400
 have 100 wheels on a car. I think they did win. They won one Grand Prix with the Swedish Grand Prix.

236
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:47,760
 What a vindication that must have been. What a moment.

237
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:53,680
 Are the cars longer? Because that's an advantage as well, right? For tight finishes. If your car is

238
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:59,280
 suddenly 10 metres long. I think of one problem is when you go into the pit stop to change your

239
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:06,160
 tyres. If you have to change 200 times, it's going to take ages. Oh, those are... I love the pit

240
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:09,680
 stops. Yeah. Those are the... Because that's a matter of variation in the race, isn't it? And they

241
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:14,320
 used to have a lollipop man. Yeah. It's so sweet, really. It's really sad that they don't anymore,

242
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:18,000
 I think. Because they always build the tracks next to primary schools.

243
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:28,640
 But I do wonder. You just got a little old lady and a smart... He's chatting to some of the mums

244
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:33,120
 and all the drivers and going, "Can I cross? Can I cross?" This pit stop has now lasted 18 minutes.

245
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:39,280
 So their job basically was to know when everyone had finished their jobs and then they

246
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:43,120
 lift up the lollipop and they could drive off. But now everyone just has a button. When you've

247
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:46,640
 done your job, you finish your things and your lights change. Just rubbish. And that's... Oh,

248
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:51,120
 that must be stressful as well. Because I can readily imagine fitting the wheel in 0.4 seconds

249
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:55,200
 and then forgetting to press my button. Yeah. Well, if you had your head bugged on your left wrist,

250
00:21:55,200 --> 00:22:02,240
 here's a crazy pit stop thing that you're not allowed to do anymore, which is... And do you

251
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:06,960
 guys remember ages ago, Lewis Hamilton, there was a bit of controversy about one of the races where

252
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:13,360
 you have your team. So he's... What's his team again? He's with... Mercedes. So he'd be on the track

253
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:17,680
 with another Mercedes rider, part of the same team. It made more sense for Lewis to win. So there was

254
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:21,600
 this big controversy that the guy in the lead slowed down and let Lewis take the win for the

255
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:27,280
 points for the team, basically. It is fine, but it's seen as... It's not sport, basically. It's...

256
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:30,960
 They should be trying. Yeah. But they do the same in cycling, don't they? I thought they

257
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:35,680
 happened to have one. In cycling, it's basically the whole spot. Yeah. I think in Formula One, it's

258
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:40,240
 obviously taboo because it was a big controversy at the time when Lewis did it. Yeah. But so what

259
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:45,760
 you used to be able to do in a pit stop is, let's say you have damaged your car. Yeah. You could

260
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:49,920
 come in and they've called over the number two because you're the lead driver and they would

261
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:55,280
 just give you his car. Wicked. So he would be out of the race. So your number two driver, you would

262
00:22:55,280 --> 00:23:00,640
 want them to be pretty much exactly the same as you, right? If you're six foot three with a very

263
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:04,320
 spindly arms, you need another six foot three with spindly arms. Well, so you don't have to factor

264
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:12,880
 around adjusting the seat and then changing the air con. Oh, radio one. But that is the thing,

265
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:17,040
 isn't it? Because they all get weighed after the race. The driver and the car are weighed

266
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:22,800
 because if you're too light, it might be dangerous and drivers lose about three kilos during a race

267
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:26,960
 of hydration, of water weight. Because it's so sweaty, right? Yeah. It's so sweaty. It apparently

268
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:30,560
 gets so hot in there as well. Like that's what's, you know, it's sweaty, it's hot, it's boiling,

269
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:34,800
 and Damon Hill, there's a story. I couldn't find a good source for it, but it's claimed in a bunch

270
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:41,600
 of places that he brings in, for some reason, a thermos of cold black tea and the heat of the car

271
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:47,920
 makes it a nice piping hot tea for it to drink. I heard that. That's very funny. The safety stuff

272
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:52,960
 is just nuts in the cars these days. It's so impressive. So these days, every single driver

273
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:59,760
 has a monocoque. It was when they used to have two cars, there was so many deaths. It was tripping

274
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:05,520
 over a lot. It's getting in the way of the levers. No, it's a cocoon, basically. It surrounds the

275
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:10,800
 driver and it's sort of the core of the car. And it's like the, I want to say a very hard bag.

276
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:15,920
 Like, it surrounds the driver and it keeps them safe even if they crash. So they get into a bag?

277
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:21,440
 They didn't know. I'm misoldering dramatically. It's just like the sort of central command pod

278
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:25,920
 of the car, which actually encases the driver. If you can imagine the meninges of the press,

279
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:30,240
 it's almost like the meninges of the driver. Exactly. It's like the very toughest mother.

280
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:34,640
 Only they called it that. I would have thrown it straight away. Yeah. And the, you know, the helmets

281
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:39,200
 are amazing. They have to be subjected, the helmets have to be subjected to 800 degree heat for 45

282
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:43,040
 seconds in case there's a fire or they have to be hot tea or hot tea.

283
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:50,800
 The boss has really taken a pattering. Every time you blink, you lose 20 meters of road.

284
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:54,720
 If you're going in fast Formula One car. So you have to be careful when you blink.

285
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:58,400
 Yeah. They've measured it and like drivers always blink at the same part of the course.

286
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:04,400
 It's really interesting. Yeah. I read that one thing that if you play the sounds of the cars

287
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:08,960
 on a Formula One track to a Formula One driver, they'll be able to tell which track it is just

288
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:12,720
 from the sounds that the cars make. Wow. Isn't that amazing? That's incredible.

289
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:19,040
 You need a special driver's license? Oh really? Perhaps, unsurprisingly. You need a super license.

290
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:24,720
 That's what it's called. Really? Yeah. Is that right? So does that mean if I took part in the Las Vegas

291
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:29,680
 Grand Prix starts this weekend? Yeah. If I flew over to Las Vegas and took part in it, I'd get

292
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:34,240
 points for not having the right license. I think you probably will get points. Yeah, yeah. Wow.

293
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:40,720
 Do it anyway. I'll try it. Shall I try it? In your electric car as well. They accelerate like

294
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:45,200
 that. They do accelerate well, but I'm not sure I could get around all the laps without retouching.

295
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:51,600
 He's now had a lovely coffee at the Supercharger. I wonder if, you know, psychopaths is that idea

296
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:57,360
 that they don't blink. I wonder if that would make you a better, there's one way apparently of spotting

297
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:02,240
 a psychopath according to people who look into it is they blink much less than a regular person.

298
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:05,200
 That's why they're forced to kill and kill again because they're so annoyed about their dry eyes.

299
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:10,800
 I just wonder if you blink less. Are you a better driver? Are they all psychopaths? Is that what

300
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:15,280
 you're saying? All these F1 drivers? Well, Senna, just back to him very quickly, sounded a bit

301
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:22,080
 sort of like he was in an odd mental place a lot of the time. Well, as in like, whenever he arrived,

302
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:26,000
 his friend said, he'd never said hi. Like if he was coming to a race, he was just in a zone. He was

303
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:31,440
 just always kind of like angry. That's like rude. God, I said hi to you this morning and it was an

304
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:37,600
 effort, frankly, but I didn't. I think that's really normal. Like I would say if you're racing,

305
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:42,160
 I can imagine not saying hello to anyone like you've got to be so in the zone. Yes. How many

306
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:45,440
 people are you having to say hi to? Because if it's just one or two people who are welcoming you,

307
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:48,560
 you're like, oh, yeah, great. You have a nice chat. But if it's like all the 50 members of the team

308
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:56,480
 are saying, hello, I like the big mascot in the silly suit. This is according to someone who works

309
00:26:56,480 --> 00:27:02,720
 for the catering operation, Lindy Redding. She said she said he would never say hi if he was in the

310
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:09,760
 zone. But when he did say hello, it was very genuine. He used to kiss us and hold our faces,

311
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:15,840
 which was hugely intense, but absolutely lovely. You know what? Let's do the not hello next time.

312
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:22,320
 This is great. That's the greeting equivalent of doing the washing up so badly that they never

313
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:32,400
 asked. Speaking of motor racing drivers, have you guys heard of Hella nice? Hella nice.

314
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:43,040
 Hella nice. Yeah. It was a person from the 1920s. Real name Mariette Ellen Delong. She was an exotic

315
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:49,840
 dancer who danced at the Ritz in Paris. And then she had a skiing accident and couldn't dance anymore.

316
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:56,160
 And so became a racing driver. And she raced in five major Grand Prix in France. And she was in

317
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:59,360
 an accident. This is why I was reading about her because we were talking about safety. She was

318
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:05,840
 in an accident where she was in an Alpha Romeo and she's somersaulted through the air. And she

319
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:10,320
 wasn't wearing a seatbelt because she didn't have to in those days. Her car went into the crowd,

320
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:15,920
 killed four people. But she survived because she landed on a soldier who absorbed the full

321
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:23,120
 impact of her body saving her life. Did he die? No, he didn't die. Sorry, did she

322
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:28,400
 fly through the air or did her car, her car went one direction, killed some people.

323
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:33,760
 She went in the other direction and luckily landed on this very pliant soldier. Wow. And they later

324
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:39,840
 married. I don't think they did now. That's amazing. It's incredible what you can survive. I mean,

325
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:44,720
 now they really saw extraordinary crashes because of the safety. But even when you look back in the

326
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:49,600
 day, I mean, in 1993, have you seen the quite a famous crash? Two teammates actually who were

327
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:54,640
 called Fittipaldi and Martini. They were quite near the back. But one of their cars was like just

328
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:58,640
 behind the other. And I think the left wheel, front wheel of one car nicked the back right

329
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:04,560
 wheel of another car. And it sent the front one into a full in the air backflip. Oh yes, yeah.

330
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:10,640
 Just does a backflip, happily lands, skates over the finish line. It's absolutely stunning. That

331
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:15,120
 showboating. It really is, yeah. To begin with the headline, Martini shaken not stirred.

332
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:24,320
 It should have done. Here's a little quiz moment for you all. Okay. Who is the guy who I think has

333
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:28,800
 done more Formula One races than anyone else? I'm 90% sure. He's done more Formula One races

334
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:34,800
 than anyone else on the planet, more Grand Prix. Grands Prix. Okay. So someone we must know of?

335
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:40,080
 No. Is it the Michelin man? It's not the Michelin man. Anna, I feel like you might have the answer.

336
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:45,040
 I've just got my hand up. I'm bursting. Are you talking about the safety guy? The guy who drives

337
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:51,040
 the safety car. Yeah, so good. He's been doing it for nearly 25 years. Yeah. He's done more than 450

338
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:55,200
 Grand Prix. I can't believe it's the same guy. I just couldn't believe it's just one bloke

339
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:59,360
 doing every single Grand Prix. So what does he do, sorry? When there's an incident on the track.

340
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:03,200
 Yeah. There's an accident or like there's a horse ride out on the track, whatever. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

341
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:09,120
 School day finishes. Receptions run out, lady car ladies already.

342
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:14,560
 The safety car drives out onto the track and kind of regulates the service. Everyone has to

343
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:18,960
 drive slowly. Yeah, he drives around at 20 miles an hour and everyone has to just slowly go behind

344
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:22,240
 them and you're not allowed to overtake anyone. Yes, of course. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You know that

345
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:26,400
 feeling when you're driving and someone's kind of coming up your arse? Imagine that like times a

346
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:31,680
 million. This is what that guy's going through every single day. Someone coming up his arse times

347
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:43,040
 a million. That is a tough job. That was work today, darling. Well, 20 men coming up my arse.

348
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:50,640
 Want to sit down? No, it's alright. It's alright. After 25 years, you're kind of, you're hard into it.

349
00:30:55,680 --> 00:31:08,080
 Okay, he's a professional racing driver. He's called Burt Maylender. That's great though. That's

350
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:12,640
 really cool. I mean, I guess he's not had any accidents himself over all that time. So

351
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:17,440
 I guess it's quite stressful and he says the most, can you guess the most stressful person to have

352
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:23,280
 behind you? What is in which racing driver is? Yeah, because I said they're quite aggressive

353
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:28,240
 sometimes. It must be Schumacher. It's actually Lewis Hamilton, he says. Lewis Hamilton's really

354
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:33,360
 up in your face or I'm like zigzagging everywhere, like really pushing, going up towards you.

355
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:37,920
 What was the point? You have to stay behind them. No, you keep your tyres warm by zigzagging.

356
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:43,680
 I think it's the most precise sport in the world. You guys have just written a book about sports.

357
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:52,240
 The big book of sports. Everything to play for, the QI book of sports. But surely this is the most,

358
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:56,080
 this is where the most thought has gone into the most tiny differences of like,

359
00:31:56,080 --> 00:32:02,720
 yeah, it is amazing. Technologically for sure. Right. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. Like even in the formula,

360
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:08,720
 there are even limits on the amount of data you're allowed to use to simulate the car aerodynamics.

361
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:14,880
 You're limited to 25 teraflops of computing power when you're running the computer simulations

362
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:19,520
 of air flowing over a car you haven't even built yet. And then after all that stuff,

363
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:23,840
 like literally last night in the warm up for the Las Vegas Grand Prix,

364
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:29,120
 someone hadn't nailed down one of the manhole covers properly, just smashed into the car.

365
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:34,160
 Oh my God, I heard about that. They get sucked up. Yeah. Why do they keep building manhole covers

366
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:40,960
 on the F1 tracks? Well, because it's it's in the actual streets of Las Vegas. And they have to

367
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:44,720
 nail down every single manhole cover. I think they might not even use nails. They might use

368
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:48,560
 like concrete or something. God, you don't want to be sort of a sewerage work who pops up at the

369
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:55,520
 wrong one. Oh fuck. An escaped convict. Yeah, yeah. That's it, isn't it?

370
00:32:55,520 --> 00:33:08,800
 Okay, it is time for fact number three, and that is Andy. My fact is, there is such a thing

371
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:21,040
 as a ghost pond. Oh, splash. Yeah. This is a, so we're all familiar with ponds. Maybe just give us

372
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:28,000
 a just for the people not from the UK. Well, no, actually, then, because, you know, what is a pond

373
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:36,000
 and what is a lake? So it's a very large hill with just matter on it. Oh, no, it's the opposite

374
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:41,200
 of that. It's a small indentation with water in it. That's right. Sorry, I always get those mixed up.

375
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:47,840
 Oh, you caught me there. You have me going. But basically, there are these things all over,

376
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:51,280
 particularly the UK, but I'm sure in other countries too. In fact, all over Europe, they

377
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:55,760
 do know that. And they, like all the farms in England used to have ponds, like fields would

378
00:33:55,760 --> 00:34:00,400
 have a pond here or there in them, and they would either provide water for cattle or they would,

379
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:04,000
 you know, they're just useful things to have. But then over the years, they got abandoned

380
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:08,320
 and lots of them dried up. Oh, maybe they got choked by fallen leaves, you know, and all these

381
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:13,840
 ponds are now missing from the UK. There used to be twice as many ponds as there are today in

382
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:19,760
 the 1970s. Double the ponds. Yeah, I know. Like, why is no one marching? Why is no one superglaring

383
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:24,800
 themselves to Heathrow Airport to bring the ponds back? Well, I think it's important that they're

384
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:30,800
 like ponds are great because so many animals and plants just. They want to.

385
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:38,720
 That was Dubai. Yeah.

386
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:44,880
 That's right. I've got a pond. Have you got a pond? Anyone else got a pond?

387
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:48,560
 I want to. It's on my list of things I'd like to do is to dig a pond. Very easy. Just dig a pond,

388
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:52,080
 put some lining in it. Yeah. Sorry, can you just tell us what these ghost ponds are there?

389
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:54,320
 Well, okay. So ghost ponds basically are about my pond.

390
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:58,560
 Just tell us anything. We're passing the pond in a minute.

391
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:02,560
 But no, basically, they're huge biodiversity hotspots. You know, you get you get plants and

392
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:06,480
 species and dragonflies and beetles and all sorts of stuff where before you just have a field and

393
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:11,840
 you know, they're really important for that. And basically the mud remembers. It's really weird.

394
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:17,360
 So all of these ancient seeds might be left in the indentation that used to be a pond and they

395
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:21,360
 can survive for over a century. And all you have to do if you have that little dip in the ground,

396
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:26,720
 you refill it, expose it to sunlight and these old species just spring up and they come back

397
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:31,360
 with a vengeance. And it's kind of staggering. So there's a team at UCL, the pond restoration

398
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:35,760
 research group led by Carl Sayer, and they've been going around Norfolk restoring these ghost

399
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:41,040
 ponds. And suddenly, bang, life, biodiversity, really important stuff, which is really under

400
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:47,600
 threat at the moment. They reckon there's 600,000 that are hidden still waiting to be restored

401
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:53,200
 in the UK alone. It's amazing. And it's longer than that, isn't it, for seeds? I'm sure we've

402
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:58,160
 mentioned and I can't remember the exact number, but like the oldest seed ever found that can still

403
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:02,960
 be, you know, watered and sunlit and grow is many thousands of years old. And so yeah, these can be

404
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:09,200
 many hundreds. And what I really like is that you can sort of see a ghostly evidence of them,

405
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:14,240
 can't you? Like from above, you can see it as like a slightly damp depression or it's a bit where

406
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:18,400
 crops don't grow as well, because it's always been a bit too wet, the soils never dried out.

407
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:23,360
 And I think often farmers, when they're expanding their land, rather than drain them, because that's

408
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:27,200
 a hassle draining a pond, they just dump a load of earth in them, wouldn't they? Or a

409
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:31,840
 load of plant matter, which doesn't stop them being wet. So they have left their little pond

410
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:37,440
 prints. So cool. But also I think ponds, they kind of have like a life duration, don't they?

411
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:42,160
 If you have a pond, like a pond farm, as you dig out a pond, right, because you're a farmer,

412
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:48,640
 if you just leave it, after about 100 years, it'll just cease to be. Oh, really? Yeah, they just kind

413
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:53,520
 of, they slowly silt up and silt up and silt up and then they die. And it could be just like one

414
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:58,320
 really heavy rainstorm. A load of silt comes down, they're not a pond anymore. They're just like these

415
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:01,680
 ephemeral things that kind of come and go. They have to be kind of maintained, don't they? A little

416
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:04,640
 bit. They do. You clear out the leaves and you know, if they've got trees over them, that's a

417
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:08,480
 nightmare for a pond, apparently. Sure is. Can I tell you about the leaves that have fallen into my

418
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:13,200
 pond? Yeah. How big is your pond? Like the table that we're recording on. Okay, the one that no

419
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:17,520
 one can see. It's about half the size of that. Oh, nice. Okay. James would describe something

420
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:23,360
 the size of a basin. It's small. It's a small pond. But you know, it's just for animals to come and

421
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:29,120
 drink stuff. You're not going to get a deer, are you? A lion kneeling down. I don't think there

422
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:34,480
 will be wildebeest of lion sipping at my pond in North London. You're not that far from the zoo.

423
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:39,840
 That's true. A catastrophic breakout and suddenly James looks out a watering hole.

424
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:51,120
 Humans make ponds. What else makes ponds? Aliens. Yes, the equivalent of crop circles,

425
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:58,160
 pond circles. Oh, lovely. Yeah, no, non-human animals. Non-human animals. Yes. I reckon like

426
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:04,640
 if you're a hippo and you sit down in some mud, then it might create a pond. Good point. Whether

427
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:10,000
 or not that would be intentional, I guess would be debated. I'm saying deliberate pond makers.

428
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:14,880
 Oh, beavers maybe. I guess they're damning things up. It's not really a pond. It's not quite. No.

429
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:19,120
 So, Andy, if you want to get a pond in your backyard, but you can't be bothered digging,

430
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:25,040
 buy yourself a Goliath frog. Oh, great. Yeah. So, Goliath frogs do this. It's a really interesting

431
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:31,200
 thing where they move rocks, giant rocks, basically their own weight and they get it so that they cut

432
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:36,480
 off water and they build their own ponds so that the eggs are more safe in there. They can keep

433
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:40,080
 attention to them, make sure the tadpoles and so on are all in place. They're their biggest

434
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:44,320
 frogs, aren't they? The Goliath frog. If for the people at home who can't see it, there's a glass

435
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:48,000
 of water in front of them, they're probably about two or three times bigger than that. Yeah,

436
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:51,760
 they're massive, really big. And they think one of the, you know, there's always theories, but one

437
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:56,160
 of the theories is that their size is to do with mating, to do with the best rock movers and, you

438
00:38:56,160 --> 00:39:00,240
 know, that's partially why they may be that big, specifically because they build ponds.

439
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:06,160
 Do you know what else makes ponds? So, this is a subset of humans. Oh, okay, I was about to say

440
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:12,320
 elephants. And schoolgirls. Subset of humans. That wasn't what I was thinking of. That can

441
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:16,720
 as a subset, though. That's a subset of humans. Why? Are you questioning whether or not they're

442
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:20,960
 humans? I wasn't sure what subset meant. I thought it meant it had to be like people

443
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:25,360
 from, you know, the southern hemisphere or like, I thought it was bigger than just saying, you know,

444
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:31,200
 slipknot fans, you know. Yeah, just a group of humans who make ponds. You used to be a schoolgirl.

445
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:35,520
 I was trying to think of what a subset of humans would be. Oh, okay. I was just wondering if when

446
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:38,960
 you were a schoolgirl, you dug ponds and that you had inside knowledge that I wouldn't have had.

447
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:44,640
 No, we got taken to ponds. So, we got told about newt. So, not schoolgirls.

448
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:51,280
 A subset of humans who make ponds. Is it a profession? No, it's more of a ideology.

449
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:56,480
 Zen gardeners. Oh, okay. That is true, undoubtedly. Not who I was thinking of.

450
00:39:56,480 --> 00:40:04,480
 Communists. Oh, the opposite. Oh, fascists. Nazis. Yes, you got it. So, there's quite a lot

451
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:11,040
 of bomb craters around Europe. And if you drop a bomb, it makes a big indentation and that indentation

452
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:18,080
 can then collect water and become a pond. Wow. So, that feels like a silver lining.

453
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:20,800
 It is, really. And possibly a reason to start more wars.

454
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:27,440
 No. I mean, well, just the Nazis were pond making, right? The Allies were pond making as well. We

455
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:32,560
 were all pond making. A lot of ponds in Dresden. Right, right, right. But yeah, a lot of ponds made

456
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:38,320
 by both sides. And the thing is that they've done some studies on it and they did this in Hungary

457
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:47,520
 in particular. And they found that they found 274 species in ponds made by bombs. And they included

458
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:53,600
 like, for instance, an algae which has previously only been found in Chilean salt lakes.

459
00:40:53,600 --> 00:41:00,080
 And a furry shrimp that had only been recorded twice in the last 25 years in Hungary. And they

460
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:04,000
 were in these ponds made by bombs. That's amazing. I mean, this is what they find with these ghost

461
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:08,240
 ponds when they rejuvenate them. You get species that you haven't seen for many, many years. And

462
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:13,520
 it's such a mystery, I think, how stuff turns up, how nature knows. And particularly, I think,

463
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:18,640
 in slightly bigger ponds than maybe James's garden pond. But you'll find, no offense.

464
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:22,640
 I can't even imagine a pond bigger than James's garden pond.

465
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:26,080
 Please don't write in for me taking the piss up, James, having a small pond, okay?

466
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:30,080
 Okay, here we are. New name for this podcast. Don't write in.

467
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:34,320
 I was the eels.

468
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:38,080
 James Harkin's podcast. Do you reckon?

469
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:42,000
 Yeah. Come on, give us that. You will need a bit more detail, but I'm interested.

470
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:45,440
 Okay, first episode, guess what leaves are falling in my pond?

471
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:47,440
 Are you having a guest to your pond each week?

472
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:49,600
 Yeah, but they'll be an animal, so they can't talk.

473
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:53,520
 First episode of Dragonfly, and they just go...

474
00:41:53,520 --> 00:42:01,360
 Monaco. We have to guess what animal is at your pond chat that week.

475
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:02,160
 Yeah, that's great.

476
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:03,440
 It's almost always a snail.

477
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:06,480
 It's never the world of bees, guys.

478
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:10,080
 So I always have eels in ponds, because how did they get there?

479
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:10,880
 Oh, yeah.

480
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:15,360
 And all we know is that eels can move across sort of...

481
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:16,880
 Not dry land, but across land.

482
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:20,000
 That's moist, because they can breathe through their skin, not just gills.

483
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:24,400
 So gills require some pressure for the water to be forced in,

484
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:25,920
 but they can actually breathe through their skin.

485
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:28,720
 So they must just flop out of a river,

486
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:30,320
 but then how do they find their way to someone's garden?

487
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:32,640
 Everyone's looking at me just to say no eels in my pond.

488
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:34,960
 Oh, that'll be a big, big episode.

489
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:35,920
 All in my hovercraft.

490
00:42:37,120 --> 00:42:41,760
 I think it's not an idea that sometimes things get in ponds because they're dropped by birds.

491
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:46,640
 Can I tell you about one of the most interesting ponds in the world?

492
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:47,200
 Please.

493
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:52,480
 This is called Don Juan Pond in Antarctica, and it's really weird.

494
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:55,200
 It's quite... It's very big. That's not the way of thing.

495
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:56,800
 It's full of water. That's not the way of thing either.

496
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:59,920
 Well, it's in Antarctica, so being full of water is unusual.

497
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:01,760
 Exactly. That is the way of thing.

498
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:03,200
 And it's because of what this water is like.

499
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:08,400
 It's really dense and really syrupy, and it's full of calcium chloride.

500
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:10,240
 It's kind of salt, right?

501
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:14,880
 And the water remains liquid, even 50 degrees below freezing.

502
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:17,600
 Even 50 Celsius below zero.

503
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:20,000
 What's that all about?

504
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,480
 Well, it's because it's the most salty body of water in the world, isn't it?

505
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:24,480
 Exactly. And they don't know where the water comes from.

506
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:26,240
 I read an interview with a scientist who said,

507
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:27,840
 "We've been studying it for 60 years.

508
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:30,800
 We're pretty sure it's fed from beneath, but we're not totally certain."

509
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:36,160
 And what does the cold feel like if it's gone beyond the point of where it freezes into a block?

510
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:37,120
 Oh, I imagine it's very cold.

511
00:43:37,120 --> 00:43:37,920
 I bet, right?

512
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:39,440
 Yeah.

513
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:41,200
 You need a wet season.

514
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:44,240
 Well, let's say you're swimming in regular water.

515
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:46,320
 It freezes, right? So you can't dive into it.

516
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:47,760
 It's a nice block. You can't get in there, right?

517
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:49,680
 Yes. I know what you mean, but you will have been outside

518
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:51,600
 in the air temperatures lower than zero.

519
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:52,480
 Yeah, but... Oh, yeah.

520
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:56,720
 No, I'm just curious what water, just the feeling, the sensation of the...

521
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:58,880
 It's really, really cold.

522
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:00,720
 I think it's just the only way anyone can...

523
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:01,680
 I don't think anyone...

524
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:04,080
 But no one must have ever jumped into this pond, because they would have died.

525
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:04,640
 There we go.

526
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:08,880
 Here's what's interesting about that thing is you would be able to lie down in there

527
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:12,160
 and read a newspaper like in the Dead Sea, because it's so salty, I guess.

528
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:15,200
 Oh, because you float right on top of it.

529
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:16,400
 Yeah, yeah, you wouldn't sink.

530
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:19,840
 Could you concentrate on what you were reading for how fucking cold it is?

531
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:25,200
 Some trickier Guardian articles might be able to stretch.

532
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:27,440
 Like the long read, you wouldn't get through.

533
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:30,000
 That's some quick bites in the sun, it'd probably be fine.

534
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,960
 You know Vespasian, the Roman emperor?

535
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:37,760
 He heard about the Dead Sea, and he heard that people just float in it,

536
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:40,400
 but he didn't believe it, and he didn't want to try it himself,

537
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:43,520
 so he just got prisoners thrown into it to see what would happen.

538
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:44,640
 Oh, wow.

539
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:45,360
 And they floated.

540
00:44:45,360 --> 00:44:46,400
 They floated, yeah.

541
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:49,360
 I will say, in case you're just going to book a trip,

542
00:44:49,360 --> 00:44:52,080
 that probably don't A, right now, but B,

543
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:54,880
 in case you were going to book a trip to the Dead Sea to float, disappointing.

544
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:55,920
 And a sank.

545
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:58,640
 That was quite sinky.

546
00:44:58,640 --> 00:44:59,680
 It's a nice review.

547
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:00,880
 One star sank.

548
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:03,600
 You had a big lunch.

549
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:15,680
 Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show, and that is James.

550
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:18,480
 Okay, my fact this week is that in 1912,

551
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:22,320
 the woman with the most perfect feet in America was devast

552
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:25,920
 because her husband was jealous of all the attention she was getting.

553
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:27,440
 Really?

554
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:28,960
 It's relatable.

555
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:30,560
 James, can I just say?

556
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:32,400
 Is that because you got such amazing feet?

557
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:34,080
 Or because you want to deposit your mind?

558
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:39,760
 Can I just say, James, this was an impossible fact to research.

559
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:43,760
 When you Google "nice feet" or "perfect feet" in America,

560
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:46,800
 oh my goodness, there's a lot of stuff to get through first,

561
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:48,160
 before you find out about--

562
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:48,720
 Yeah, he had--

563
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:50,080
 Tell us about this woman.

564
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:52,000
 Well, she just had really nice feet.

565
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:57,680
 It was a stunt by the Caropedists of the USA to find the perfect foot,

566
00:45:57,680 --> 00:46:01,360
 and they eventually managed to find it on the end of a leg

567
00:46:01,360 --> 00:46:04,960
 of a woman called Miss Clara Smith Houston,

568
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:07,040
 who coincidentally was also a Caropedist.

569
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:07,680
 Yeah.

570
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:08,800
 Anyway, so--

571
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:09,440
 Suspects.

572
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:10,800
 Feels a bit rigged to me, doesn't it?

573
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:11,840
 It does feel a bit rigged.

574
00:46:11,840 --> 00:46:12,160
 I don't know.

575
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:14,880
 You might get into an industry because your feet are so nice.

576
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:16,720
 People have complimented you your whole life.

577
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:18,000
 They thought, yeah.

578
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:21,520
 Well, anyway, this story made it into some newspapers,

579
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:23,360
 just as the Caropedists had hoped.

580
00:46:23,360 --> 00:46:27,360
 But the husband of Miss Smith Houston was not impressed,

581
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:31,680
 and he sent her a telegram, like really divorced by text,

582
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:34,960
 saying "friend, wife," not a great start.

583
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:39,440
 "Congratulations on putting your best foot forward."

584
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:40,400
 Nice pun.

585
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:42,880
 "Nothing like notoriety, no matter how cheap."

586
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:47,120
 "Send your picture to the Pink Journals and call on me for cash,

587
00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:52,320
 with which to advertise yourself further, full stop, your husband, full stop."

588
00:46:52,320 --> 00:46:56,160
 And then Clara was later quoted in another newspaper saying

589
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:58,320
 that she decided if a man was so jealous,

590
00:46:58,320 --> 00:47:01,520
 he would not even allow me to boast of a perfect foot,

591
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:03,840
 then I best give him up and all the luxuries

592
00:47:03,840 --> 00:47:05,680
 with which he provided me.

593
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:08,320
 Except the one thing, happiness.

594
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:11,760
 Here, here, here, here, Clara Houston.

595
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:12,240
 I agree.

596
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:12,800
 I get the luxuries.

597
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:13,360
 Can I just--

598
00:47:13,360 --> 00:47:16,800
 So his message, when he's saying advertise yourself in a newspaper,

599
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:18,880
 is he saying 'cause you're single now?

600
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:20,080
 What's that second, what's that look?

601
00:47:20,080 --> 00:47:21,200
 I think he's saying just 'cause it's--

602
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:22,560
 Oh, you're now a foot person, are you?

603
00:47:22,560 --> 00:47:24,560
 You know, you're now just sort of like trading on your feet.

604
00:47:24,560 --> 00:47:27,760
 I think he was also implying that she was living off his money.

605
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:31,040
 And he was like, "Well, if you want more money,

606
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:34,160
 just to advertise yourself to the world for your awesome feet,

607
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:37,280
 then fine, full stop, your husband, full stop."

608
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:39,680
 Those agro-full stops.

609
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:41,680
 So the question here is, what is the perfect foot?

610
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:42,960
 What did Clara have?

611
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:44,000
 And she had--

612
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:44,720
 Seven toes.

613
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:46,480
 She had seven toes.

614
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:47,760
 I guess having seven toes.

615
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:52,400
 So she had nine inches.

616
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:53,600
 They were nine inches long.

617
00:47:53,600 --> 00:47:55,360
 Do you know what size that is, though?

618
00:47:55,360 --> 00:47:56,800
 I just know.

619
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:58,080
 I've just read it from this.

620
00:47:58,080 --> 00:47:59,440
 So you've just written down nine inches,

621
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:01,120
 but you don't know how big or small that is,

622
00:48:01,120 --> 00:48:02,400
 presumably for a woman's foot.

623
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:02,880
 'Cause I don't know--

624
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:04,000
 At least Dan goes into the shoe shop

625
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:07,520
 and he says, "I reject your size existence.

626
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:09,840
 I'm going to give you an inches.

627
00:48:09,840 --> 00:48:10,480
 You can work it out."

628
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:13,200
 256 barley corns, my good Dan.

629
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:20,000
 I'd like a shoe that's about the size of a glass,

630
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,920
 which I dragged from the other day.

631
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:26,080
 I want a shoe that doesn't fit in James' con.

632
00:48:26,080 --> 00:48:33,680
 Well, for the listener, it's size 3.5, which is fairly small.

633
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:34,640
 And what is the--

634
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:37,760
 Why is it saying 10 inches around the instep?

635
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:39,120
 The circumference, I suppose.

636
00:48:39,120 --> 00:48:39,520
 Yes.

637
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:40,080
 OK.

638
00:48:40,080 --> 00:48:40,800
 Nice.

639
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:42,800
 So very small feet, 3.5.

640
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:44,960
 I mean, not freakishly small.

641
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:46,160
 No, but that is small.

642
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:50,160
 It's exactly 1/7th her height in accordance

643
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:52,320
 with the Greek rule of sculpture.

644
00:48:52,320 --> 00:48:53,360
 Oh, that's interesting.

645
00:48:53,360 --> 00:48:53,840
 Yeah.

646
00:48:53,840 --> 00:48:54,560
 OK.

647
00:48:54,560 --> 00:48:57,120
 This is from the Day Book, where this was all published.

648
00:48:57,120 --> 00:48:59,280
 And it's an amazing blog, by the way, that you found, James.

649
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:00,000
 Yes.

650
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:00,880
 Second Glance History.

651
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:02,160
 Yeah, it's absolutely brilliant.

652
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:03,120
 And it was really nice,

653
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:05,680
 'cause they had the cuttings of all the newspapers and stuff.

654
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:06,160
 Yeah.

655
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:07,920
 So I didn't have to go digging for them myself.

656
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:14,400
 And then they found that there was a new perfect foot found in 1916,

657
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:16,960
 which belonged to a nine-year-old girl called Mary Boca.

658
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:20,080
 This was found in Chicago.

659
00:49:20,080 --> 00:49:23,840
 And Mary's mom said, "Mary had very pretty feet when she was a baby.

660
00:49:23,840 --> 00:49:26,320
 I felt nature's gift must not be marred.

661
00:49:26,320 --> 00:49:28,560
 I began massaging her feet with cold cream

662
00:49:28,560 --> 00:49:30,320
 to make them strong and smooth

663
00:49:30,320 --> 00:49:33,680
 and rubbed them carefully to preserve the natural outline."

664
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:34,080
 Yeah.

665
00:49:34,080 --> 00:49:36,080
 And so her mom realized when she was really young

666
00:49:36,080 --> 00:49:37,440
 that she had really nice feet

667
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:39,600
 and then put special stockings on her

668
00:49:39,600 --> 00:49:41,920
 so that she didn't damage the feet and all that kind of stuff.

669
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:43,760
 It's like the William Sisters' dad, isn't it?

670
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:47,280
 I bet they made a Hollywood film about her in the '30s.

671
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:49,680
 I just don't get the whole feet thing.

672
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:51,760
 I know lots of people really like feet.

673
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:52,960
 20% of men, I believe.

674
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:54,080
 Only 3% of them.

675
00:49:54,080 --> 00:49:55,040
 20% of straight men.

676
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:55,840
 I think it was that.

677
00:49:55,840 --> 00:49:56,800
 Or maybe it was 10%.

678
00:49:56,800 --> 00:49:57,600
 What do you mean, really?

679
00:49:57,600 --> 00:49:58,320
 I feel like I...

680
00:49:58,320 --> 00:49:59,120
 Fetishize.

681
00:49:59,120 --> 00:49:59,600
 Right, okay.

682
00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:00,320
 Oh, really?

683
00:50:00,320 --> 00:50:02,960
 'Cause there's a website called wikifeet.

684
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:03,520
 Oh, yeah.

685
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:06,160
 It features a great number of feet.

686
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:08,720
 Features greatly in your search history after this week.

687
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:09,280
 It does now.

688
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:12,480
 There are only three rules on wikifeet.

689
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:14,240
 Only five toes.

690
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:20,640
 The rules change constantly.

691
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:22,800
 Updating their feet.

692
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:25,760
 No, so you have to be...

693
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:28,560
 It's normally people posting pictures of women's feet.

694
00:50:28,560 --> 00:50:31,440
 I don't think the men section on wikifeet is enormous.

695
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:34,160
 It's sort of women over 17 who are listed on IMDb.

696
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:35,680
 So you have to be in the public eye somehow.

697
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:38,880
 No copyright breaches and no adult content.

698
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:41,200
 But there are people who complain a lot.

699
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:43,680
 They get in rouse with each other on wikifeet.

700
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:46,160
 They'll post on a photo NFS.

701
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:47,920
 Which means no feet showing.

702
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:48,720
 Which is a point.

703
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:49,680
 I know it is, yeah.

704
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:50,560
 That is weird.

705
00:50:50,560 --> 00:50:52,080
 But I think if it's if someone's wearing...

706
00:50:52,080 --> 00:50:53,280
 Maybe if you've got a welly on.

707
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:55,520
 This is pointless to me.

708
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:57,760
 I think if you've got a welly on, you're on the right side.

709
00:50:57,760 --> 00:51:00,720
 My friend has a page.

710
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:01,360
 It's a mutual friend.

711
00:51:01,360 --> 00:51:02,160
 I won't say her name, though,

712
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:03,520
 'cause it is a bit of a weird site.

713
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:05,360
 But she has a page on there.

714
00:51:05,360 --> 00:51:07,120
 And it has ratings.

715
00:51:07,120 --> 00:51:08,800
 So she has three out of five.

716
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:09,280
 Three.

717
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:10,800
 Yeah, which is okay.

718
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:11,680
 She's got okay feet.

719
00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:12,880
 You wouldn't get in the Uber, would you?

720
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:13,840
 If I had a three out of five.

721
00:51:13,840 --> 00:51:16,880
 I think it's a bit...

722
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:18,480
 I mean, obviously it's pretty odd stuff.

723
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:20,320
 And I think you can, if you say,

724
00:51:20,320 --> 00:51:22,560
 take my pictures off this website, they do.

725
00:51:22,560 --> 00:51:23,280
 Yeah, okay.

726
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:24,720
 Yeah, they seem quite nice.

727
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:26,160
 There was a journalist who writes for the...

728
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:27,920
 Well, I read an article in the cut anyway.

729
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:29,520
 So she writes for the cut and all the other things.

730
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:31,760
 And she was going out with someone who said,

731
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:33,360
 "Hey, do you know you're on wikifeet?"

732
00:51:33,360 --> 00:51:35,120
 And she said, "No, I don't."

733
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:38,240
 And so saw that she had indeed been uploaded.

734
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:39,280
 Her feet had been uploaded

735
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:41,600
 'cause they get it off like public Instagram pages,

736
00:51:41,600 --> 00:51:42,160
 for instance.

737
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:44,480
 So they were pictures of her on the beach on Instagram

738
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:45,840
 and someone's taken her feet.

739
00:51:45,840 --> 00:51:48,720
 And she said, "Okay, I'll get in touch."

740
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:50,480
 So she got in touch with the person.

741
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:53,440
 And so she interviewed this guy who posted her feet.

742
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:55,920
 And she was very fair, I have to say.

743
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:57,680
 And I thought he did seem a bit odd.

744
00:51:57,680 --> 00:52:00,800
 And she did say at one point,

745
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:02,800
 "I've noticed that sometimes within 10 minutes

746
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:04,880
 "of me posting an Instagram story that shows my feet,

747
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:06,720
 "the screenshot is up on wikifeet.

748
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:08,320
 "How does that happen?"

749
00:52:08,320 --> 00:52:10,240
 And he said, "Look, I don't just sit there looking for it.

750
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:12,640
 "If I happen to see it and I like it, I'll put it on there.

751
00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:14,880
 "But I'm not sitting there all day and staring."

752
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:17,760
 It's like, it sort of started off quite nice.

753
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:19,200
 And then he obviously, you know,

754
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:21,280
 he kept on saying what beautiful feet she had.

755
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:24,800
 - I read an article that said that the incidence

756
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:28,560
 of fetishism increases as a response to epidemics

757
00:52:28,560 --> 00:52:30,960
 of sexually transmitted diseases in history.

758
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:32,560
 - Interesting.

759
00:52:32,560 --> 00:52:36,080
 This was a guy called Dr. James Giannini

760
00:52:36,080 --> 00:52:38,320
 and his colleagues who did the study.

761
00:52:38,320 --> 00:52:41,360
 And they look back as far back as the 12th century.

762
00:52:41,360 --> 00:52:44,320
 And they found that when there was a spike in STIs,

763
00:52:44,320 --> 00:52:45,840
 people preferred feet.

764
00:52:45,840 --> 00:52:48,320
 And it might have been that they were just less interested

765
00:52:48,320 --> 00:52:50,560
 in penetrative sex because they might get diseases.

766
00:52:50,560 --> 00:52:53,200
 - So your feet are a bit safer to fancy?

767
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:54,320
 - I guess so.

768
00:52:54,320 --> 00:52:55,140
 - Yeah.

769
00:52:55,140 --> 00:52:57,120
 - Because what's the worst you can get?

770
00:52:57,120 --> 00:52:58,480
 Athlete's cock on your cock.

771
00:52:58,480 --> 00:52:59,600
 (laughing)

772
00:52:59,600 --> 00:53:00,720
 - Athlete's cock.

773
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:01,560
 - Yeah.

774
00:53:01,560 --> 00:53:03,360
 - And then they went all the way up to the 80s

775
00:53:03,360 --> 00:53:05,040
 and they found even in the AIDS epidemic

776
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:08,840
 that when that happened, then the numbers of foot oriented

777
00:53:08,840 --> 00:53:11,240
 and foot fetish pictures in kind of porn magazines

778
00:53:11,240 --> 00:53:12,600
 and stuff shot up there.

779
00:53:12,600 --> 00:53:14,520
 Because yeah, so preservation, I guess.

780
00:53:14,520 --> 00:53:16,400
 People are thinking, well, where else can I go?

781
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:18,840
 - Can I tell you about Hogan Fukunaga?

782
00:53:18,840 --> 00:53:19,680
 - Yeah.

783
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:21,120
 - He was arrested in the year 2000.

784
00:53:21,120 --> 00:53:22,120
 - Oh no.

785
00:53:22,120 --> 00:53:22,960
 - I know.

786
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:24,560
 Along with 11 acolytes.

787
00:53:24,560 --> 00:53:26,120
 That's a bad start, isn't it?

788
00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:26,960
 (laughing)

789
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:28,800
 When you and your acolytes have been picked up.

790
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:30,400
 (laughing)

791
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:33,600
 - So he was the head of a cult in Japan

792
00:53:33,600 --> 00:53:36,360
 which offered followers analysis of their spiritual

793
00:53:36,360 --> 00:53:39,080
 and mental health entirely based on their toes.

794
00:53:39,080 --> 00:53:39,920
 - Right.

795
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:43,760
 - So followers would pay 600 quid to have their feet stroked

796
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:46,760
 and then looked at by Mr. Fukunaga.

797
00:53:46,760 --> 00:53:48,080
 - Consenting adults.

798
00:53:48,080 --> 00:53:53,080
 - Consenting adults with more money than sense.

799
00:53:53,080 --> 00:53:56,220
 And no, consenting adults with maybe too much money

800
00:53:56,220 --> 00:53:58,360
 on their hands and who fell for the story

801
00:53:58,360 --> 00:54:01,000
 that, oh, I can predict your future through your toes.

802
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,680
 - It's like a pedicure cum fortune teller, right?

803
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:06,480
 - Yeah, it's like cross my foot with silver.

804
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:07,880
 (laughing)

805
00:54:07,880 --> 00:54:10,680
 The predictions were all very suffering based.

806
00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:12,760
 They predicted, oh, you'll die of a horrible disease

807
00:54:12,760 --> 00:54:13,760
 or you'll fall into debt.

808
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:15,800
 So that wasn't nice.

809
00:54:15,800 --> 00:54:17,480
 But you can avert your problems if you sign up

810
00:54:17,480 --> 00:54:18,480
 for one of our lecture courses

811
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:20,800
 or if you buy a pinch of Buddha's ashes

812
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:23,200
 at a mere 120,000 pounds.

813
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:24,040
 - Okay.

814
00:54:24,040 --> 00:54:25,760
 - They were running this cult for about 15 years.

815
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:28,000
 They made 500 million quid out of it.

816
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:28,840
 - Wow.

817
00:54:28,840 --> 00:54:29,680
 - Yeah.

818
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:31,000
 And then he claimed later on

819
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:32,720
 that he had been simply obeying the voice of heaven

820
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:35,240
 but that he had since forgotten what the voice had said.

821
00:54:35,240 --> 00:54:36,160
 (laughing)

822
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:37,680
 - RIP a lot of people off, maybe.

823
00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:38,760
 - I think so.

824
00:54:38,760 --> 00:54:40,000
 - It feels like in this cult being called

825
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:41,840
 the head of the operation is the wrong title.

826
00:54:41,840 --> 00:54:43,160
 (laughing)

827
00:54:43,160 --> 00:54:44,600
 That should be the junior role.

828
00:54:44,600 --> 00:54:46,640
 - Yeah, you're absolutely right.

829
00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:47,960
 - Yeah, he was the big toe.

830
00:54:47,960 --> 00:54:50,280
 When you have an enormous interest in feet,

831
00:54:50,280 --> 00:54:52,120
 I believe it's called podophilia,

832
00:54:52,120 --> 00:54:55,400
 which means there is a word that should be coined

833
00:54:55,400 --> 00:54:57,800
 for people who have an abnormal interest in podcasts.

834
00:54:57,800 --> 00:55:00,880
 So when I have Harkin's podcast,

835
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:03,320
 you might have Andy's podophile cast.

836
00:55:03,320 --> 00:55:04,660
 - No, I'm saying that-

837
00:55:04,660 --> 00:55:06,960
 - Would all your acolytes be called podophiles?

838
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:09,400
 (laughing)

839
00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:10,840
 You can get badges made.

840
00:55:10,840 --> 00:55:12,480
 (laughing)

841
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:16,040
 - I'm a podophile, I shouted the mob out like my house.

842
00:55:16,040 --> 00:55:18,280
 (laughing)

843
00:55:18,280 --> 00:55:22,400
 - No, but there should be a word for people

844
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:23,800
 who like podcast lots

845
00:55:23,800 --> 00:55:25,360
 because podophile is taken by the feet people, right?

846
00:55:25,360 --> 00:55:26,480
 - Let's call them feetophiles.

847
00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:27,320
 - Yes.

848
00:55:27,320 --> 00:55:29,760
 - We'll take their word back.

849
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:31,240
 - But you know, there should be something.

850
00:55:31,240 --> 00:55:32,160
 - Audio file.

851
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:33,360
 - Audio file, that's good,

852
00:55:33,360 --> 00:55:36,640
 but it's quite confusing 'cause it's also an audio file.

853
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:37,480
 - Yeah.

854
00:55:37,480 --> 00:55:39,680
 - Oh, that's what makes it so perfect.

855
00:55:39,680 --> 00:55:42,760
 Sorry, it's actually better than a confusing, yeah, yeah.

856
00:55:42,760 --> 00:55:43,920
 - Yeah.

857
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:48,920
 - So famous names who love a foot include Elvis.

858
00:55:48,920 --> 00:55:50,600
 - Are we really doing this?

859
00:55:50,600 --> 00:55:51,440
 - We're really doing.

860
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:52,800
 - There's a lot of people who have admitted

861
00:55:52,800 --> 00:55:55,080
 to loving feet and having been a feet.

862
00:55:55,080 --> 00:55:57,440
 - It's quite, it's just quite a turn for us, isn't it?

863
00:55:57,440 --> 00:55:58,960
 Like celebrity toe suckers.

864
00:55:58,960 --> 00:55:59,800
 - Yeah.

865
00:55:59,800 --> 00:56:02,440
 - Apparently the podcast is now about.

866
00:56:02,440 --> 00:56:04,760
 - It was a story, but apparently Elvis really loved it.

867
00:56:04,760 --> 00:56:06,680
 What's interesting is there is obviously

868
00:56:06,680 --> 00:56:08,720
 quite a lot of famous stories about, you know,

869
00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:10,880
 his henchmen would go out into a crown after a gig.

870
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:13,280
 - Good henchmen and cut off people's feet.

871
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:14,840
 (laughing)

872
00:56:14,840 --> 00:56:16,600
 - And they would bring them back to the volcano

873
00:56:16,600 --> 00:56:18,440
 where the Elvis had his Graceland.

874
00:56:18,440 --> 00:56:20,360
 - His foot soldiers, yeah, they would go out.

875
00:56:20,360 --> 00:56:22,960
 - And they would, so they would, you know, go,

876
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:24,520
 you, you, do you want to come meet Elvis?

877
00:56:24,520 --> 00:56:25,840
 And obviously it was, you know,

878
00:56:25,840 --> 00:56:27,120
 to bring women backstage.

879
00:56:27,120 --> 00:56:29,240
 And apparently they screened their feet.

880
00:56:29,240 --> 00:56:30,480
 Is, is what is up with that?

881
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:33,040
 - Were they crawling around on the floor in the gig?

882
00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:34,160
 Just looking for feet.

883
00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:36,000
 (laughing)

884
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:37,840
 - I dropped an earring.

885
00:56:37,840 --> 00:56:39,920
 Presumably most women went to the gigs wearing shoes.

886
00:56:39,920 --> 00:56:41,400
 How are they doing that?

887
00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:43,960
 - Don't, I, I, you know, it's just a rumor.

888
00:56:43,960 --> 00:56:45,840
 - What, it's just a rumor?

889
00:56:45,840 --> 00:56:48,200
 - We know that he loved feet and the, the story is,

890
00:56:48,200 --> 00:56:49,900
 is that that was part of what it, you know,

891
00:56:49,900 --> 00:56:52,080
 the screening is what would go on and I'm lucky.

892
00:56:52,080 --> 00:56:52,920
 - Story is.

893
00:56:52,920 --> 00:56:56,200
 - Can I, can I steer us back towards karma waters?

894
00:56:56,200 --> 00:56:57,200
 - Sure.

895
00:56:57,200 --> 00:56:58,520
 - I think about corns.

896
00:56:58,520 --> 00:57:01,000
 You know, you get corns on your feet.

897
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:01,840
 - Yeah.

898
00:57:01,840 --> 00:57:02,680
 - Oh, okay, yeah, yeah.

899
00:57:02,680 --> 00:57:04,860
 - Can, can you, can they transfer to your pain?

900
00:57:04,860 --> 00:57:06,960
 (laughing)

901
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:08,880
 I don't believe so.

902
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:09,880
 - Cock corn.

903
00:57:09,880 --> 00:57:12,160
 - But they used to, it used to have street corn cutters,

904
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:13,000
 right?

905
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:13,840
 That was the thing.

906
00:57:13,840 --> 00:57:14,680
 - Oh God, really?

907
00:57:14,680 --> 00:57:15,520
 - Yeah.

908
00:57:15,520 --> 00:57:17,240
 I mean, it was, you know, it's sort of pretty,

909
00:57:17,240 --> 00:57:18,960
 and it's, it's obviously, if you have corns,

910
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:19,920
 they're really painful.

911
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:20,760
 - What would you do?

912
00:57:20,760 --> 00:57:22,180
 - Like filing a nail, like that kind of material.

913
00:57:22,180 --> 00:57:23,840
 - All sorts of procedures, basically.

914
00:57:23,840 --> 00:57:25,880
 - But the weird thing is, I just like this,

915
00:57:25,880 --> 00:57:27,640
 I was on the blog Foot Talk,

916
00:57:27,640 --> 00:57:30,320
 which is another great foot based blog.

917
00:57:30,320 --> 00:57:31,160
 - Oh yeah.

918
00:57:31,160 --> 00:57:32,320
 - I really recommend it.

919
00:57:32,320 --> 00:57:33,480
 But there used to be jingles.

920
00:57:33,480 --> 00:57:35,160
 They would advertise themselves by singing jingles

921
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:36,000
 in the streets.

922
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:37,800
 And the weird thing about this is that sometimes

923
00:57:37,800 --> 00:57:42,600
 celebrity composers would write jingles for corn cutters.

924
00:57:42,600 --> 00:57:43,440
 - Really?

925
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:44,280
 - Yeah, yeah.

926
00:57:44,280 --> 00:57:45,120
 - Like how celebrity are we talking?

927
00:57:45,120 --> 00:57:46,520
 Mozart's, God is.

928
00:57:46,520 --> 00:57:47,360
 - Well.

929
00:57:47,360 --> 00:57:48,200
 - Irving Berlin.

930
00:57:48,200 --> 00:57:49,960
 - I'm gonna say the name Orlando Gibbons.

931
00:57:49,960 --> 00:57:50,800
 - Oh yeah?

932
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:51,880
 - Oh my God.

933
00:57:51,880 --> 00:57:52,720
 - Yeah.

934
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:53,720
 - Not Orlando.

935
00:57:53,720 --> 00:57:55,960
 - Wait, I mean, so he.

936
00:57:55,960 --> 00:57:57,040
 - Wow.

937
00:57:57,040 --> 00:57:58,160
 - He was famous at the time.

938
00:57:58,160 --> 00:58:00,440
 He, you know, he was the organist at Westminster Abbey.

939
00:58:00,440 --> 00:58:02,800
 He was eventually named Virginalist to the King.

940
00:58:02,800 --> 00:58:05,440
 (all laughing)

941
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:08,600
 - That was a storm, he was kind of like that, wasn't it?

942
00:58:08,600 --> 00:58:11,320
 - A virtual being, a kind of piano, obviously.

943
00:58:11,320 --> 00:58:14,960
 - Do we have the song then?

944
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:15,800
 The jingle one?

945
00:58:15,800 --> 00:58:17,280
 - Sadly, I don't think we do.

946
00:58:17,280 --> 00:58:19,080
 They're pretty sure that he came up with jingles

947
00:58:19,080 --> 00:58:21,320
 for corn cutters as well, as a kind of sideline.

948
00:58:21,320 --> 00:58:23,520
 I don't know if it was lucrative or something to do.

949
00:58:23,520 --> 00:58:24,920
 - You guys are just reminding me.

950
00:58:24,920 --> 00:58:28,720
 Wilf, my son, he used to love corn on the cob,

951
00:58:28,720 --> 00:58:30,800
 but he always used to call it corn on the cock.

952
00:58:30,800 --> 00:58:32,840
 That was the phrase that he used.

953
00:58:32,840 --> 00:58:34,640
 - Can I tell you something about horses feet?

954
00:58:34,640 --> 00:58:35,480
 - Yeah.

955
00:58:35,480 --> 00:58:36,320
 - Which I love.

956
00:58:36,320 --> 00:58:40,280
 Is that horses feet are always giving you a middle finger.

957
00:58:40,280 --> 00:58:41,520
 One big middle finger.

958
00:58:41,520 --> 00:58:44,880
 Every horse's hoof is what we call a horse's foot.

959
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:46,400
 It's just a big middle finger.

960
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:50,600
 And this is because they once had five toes on their feet.

961
00:58:50,600 --> 00:58:52,400
 Many, many, many years ago.

962
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:54,120
 There are actually kind of three of them still visible

963
00:58:54,120 --> 00:58:55,600
 'cause you've got two little vestigial ones.

964
00:58:55,600 --> 00:58:56,680
 If you know, horse's legs,

965
00:58:56,680 --> 00:58:58,640
 they're kind of a bit out of the leg.

966
00:58:58,640 --> 00:59:01,040
 But the hoof is just the middle finger.

967
00:59:01,040 --> 00:59:04,840
 And there's actually a biologist called Catherine Cavana

968
00:59:04,840 --> 00:59:07,960
 who recently was sorting through preserved horse embryos

969
00:59:07,960 --> 00:59:09,440
 for reasons she didn't go into.

970
00:59:09,440 --> 00:59:12,920
 And she saw that in the very, very early days

971
00:59:12,920 --> 00:59:15,800
 of horse gestation, they have five fingers

972
00:59:15,800 --> 00:59:16,640
 on each foot.

973
00:59:16,640 --> 00:59:17,460
 - Wow.

974
00:59:17,460 --> 00:59:19,200
 - And then you see it in the cells

975
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:20,480
 and it's like they're about to grow

976
00:59:20,480 --> 00:59:21,640
 and then they decide not to grow

977
00:59:21,640 --> 00:59:22,960
 because they've evolved out of it.

978
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:24,040
 - So let me ask you this.

979
00:59:24,040 --> 00:59:27,360
 If a horse with five toes rocks up to the Grand National,

980
00:59:27,360 --> 00:59:28,480
 are there regulations to say?

981
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:29,600
 - No rules against it.

982
00:59:29,600 --> 00:59:30,440
 No rules against it.

983
00:59:30,440 --> 00:59:31,280
 - No rules, no rules.

984
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:32,600
 And it's five times faster.

985
00:59:32,600 --> 00:59:34,080
 - Yeah, ridden by a crocodile.

986
00:59:34,080 --> 00:59:36,320
 (laughing)

987
00:59:36,320 --> 00:59:39,600
 You know that the women of Chicago

988
00:59:39,600 --> 00:59:41,120
 have been famous throughout America

989
00:59:41,120 --> 00:59:43,480
 for abnormally sized feet.

990
00:59:43,480 --> 00:59:44,400
 - Big or small?

991
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:45,240
 - Big.

992
00:59:45,240 --> 00:59:46,080
 - Okay.

993
00:59:46,080 --> 00:59:47,280
 - In the early 20th century.

994
00:59:47,280 --> 00:59:50,880
 So this perfect foot, the second one was in Chicago.

995
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:51,800
 And everyone was surprised

996
00:59:51,800 --> 00:59:54,280
 because people in Chicago usually have massive feet.

997
00:59:54,280 --> 00:59:55,520
 - What a funny key shape to have about it.

998
00:59:55,520 --> 00:59:56,360
 - It's amazing.

999
00:59:56,360 --> 00:59:57,760
 And I looked in the newspaper archives

1000
00:59:57,760 --> 01:00:00,400
 and sure enough, if you look like before, you know,

1001
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:02,960
 the 20s and so it's for big feet Chicago,

1002
01:00:02,960 --> 01:00:04,200
 there's all these articles are going,

1003
01:00:04,200 --> 01:00:05,800
 "Yeah, they all got big feet."

1004
01:00:05,800 --> 01:00:07,480
 And then you get people in Chicago saying,

1005
01:00:07,480 --> 01:00:08,640
 "Yeah, we do have big feet,

1006
01:00:08,640 --> 01:00:11,080
 but actually that also means we have big intellect."

1007
01:00:11,080 --> 01:00:11,920
 - Wow.

1008
01:00:11,920 --> 01:00:12,760
 - Yeah, sure it does.

1009
01:00:12,760 --> 01:00:14,640
 - Is it just the women or is it the people in Chicago?

1010
01:00:14,640 --> 01:00:15,920
 - It's the women of Chicago.

1011
01:00:15,920 --> 01:00:17,920
 - Is it so that they can like walk out

1012
01:00:17,920 --> 01:00:19,880
 over the Great Lakes and distribute their weight better?

1013
01:00:19,880 --> 01:00:21,520
 - Oh, that would be good, yeah.

1014
01:00:21,520 --> 01:00:23,320
 - I thought maybe 'cause it's the windy city, isn't it?

1015
01:00:23,320 --> 01:00:25,080
 And it would help you not to get blown over.

1016
01:00:25,080 --> 01:00:25,920
 - Great shouts.

1017
01:00:25,920 --> 01:00:26,760
 - Yeah.

1018
01:00:26,760 --> 01:00:28,080
 - Yeah, it's got all these uses.

1019
01:00:28,080 --> 01:00:29,240
 - That's evolution.

1020
01:00:29,240 --> 01:00:30,160
 - That is such funny.

1021
01:00:30,160 --> 01:00:31,240
 Is there any evidence behind it?

1022
01:00:31,240 --> 01:00:32,080
 As it is, is it true?

1023
01:00:32,080 --> 01:00:33,200
 - No, I can't be true.

1024
01:00:33,200 --> 01:00:35,600
 I mean, I'll be honest, I haven't gone to Chicago

1025
01:00:35,600 --> 01:00:37,600
 and measured all the women's feet.

1026
01:00:37,600 --> 01:00:38,440
 But it can't be true.

1027
01:00:38,440 --> 01:00:39,440
 - Get Elvis's henchmen to go and do it.

1028
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:41,700
 (laughing)

1029
01:00:41,700 --> 01:00:44,280
 (upbeat music)

1030
01:00:44,280 --> 01:00:46,860
 (upbeat music)

1031
01:00:46,860 --> 01:00:49,000
 - Okay, that's it.

1032
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:50,080
 That is all of our facts.

1033
01:00:50,080 --> 01:00:51,560
