WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.920
 Hi everyone. Just before we started this show, we wanted to remind you of something that you

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:11.520
 should already be well aware of, which is that our esteemed colleagues and co-podcasters,

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:18.080
 Dan Treiber and Andrew Hunter Murray, have both written books and they are truly fantastic books.

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:24.320
 So, if you have anyone in your life who is a fish fan, who, God forbid, thinks that Dan and Andy

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:30.960
 are the superior half of fish, perhaps that person is you, then why not get them for Christmas,

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:37.360
 a book by Dan and a book by Andy. Dan has written the theory of everything else and honestly, when

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:42.800
 I read it, on every page, I thought, "How have you been hogging these facts for this book rather

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:47.440
 than sharing them on the podcast?" It is so selfish, but it's made for a brilliant book,

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:54.000
 stunning revelations on every page. Andy has written the last day and the sanctuary. They're

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.320
 both thrillers. They're real page turners. They're a fantastic twist and turns and of course,

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:04.560
 they're making some very intelligent points about society today. So, get both of those for

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:09.600
 anyone you know who's a big fan of Dan and Andy. But Anna, what if the people listening to this

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.240
 prefer this half of the podcast, the James and Anna half of the podcast? What are those people

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:20.640
 going to do? Oh, you mean the 95 other percent of our listeners. Oh, I don't know, James. Have we

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.040
 done anything interesting lately? We have indeed. I don't know if you recall, because it was before

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:30.640
 you went on maternity leave, but we wrote a book called "Everything to Play for the QI Book of Sports"

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:36.400
 and it is another book that is jammed full of facts. Do you know why ancient Egyptian athletes

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:42.880
 removed their spleens? Why pool balls no longer explode on impact? How bum slapping improves

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:48.880
 team performance? All that and more, you can learn in our book, which is called "Everything to Play for

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:56.000
 the QI Book of Sports". But the truth is, if you or anyone you know is a big fish fan, these are

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.880
 the perfect things to get them for Christmas. Who doesn't love opening a present at Christmas

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:10.240
 and getting a good old book that they can read? Read. If you too like to do this strange reading

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:16.320
 thing that Anna does, then go to Noticesthinkasafish.com/books and you'll be able to find all the

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:21.120
 details of those three books, but they're available wherever you buy your books. Get them all, get

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:27.200
 them for everyone you know for Christmas. Get them now. On with the show. On with the podcast.

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:49.040
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming to you

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:54.960
 from the QI offices in Hobart. My name is Dad Shriver. I am sitting here with James Harkin,

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:59.360
 Andrew Hunter Murray and Anna Tyshinski. And once again, we have gathered around the microphones

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:05.040
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days. And in a particular order here we go. Starting

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:12.400
 with fact number one, that is Anna. My fact this week is that your brain contains a tender mother,

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:17.680
 a tough mother and a spider mother. Is that just Dan we're talking about here?

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:24.800
 Yeah, and it explains everything. It does. Are these like multiple personality traits of like I

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:28.640
 have a tough mother that comes, is that the idea of it? Oh, I love that idea. What would the spider

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:32.720
 mother be? Well, I assume there's something that they do in the wild where they make webs. I hope

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:36.080
 they like eat their children. Yeah, eating each other. The spider mother actually eats the tough

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:39.680
 mother and the tender mother. It's actually neither of these things. They're just fun names

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:44.560
 for things in the brain. So these are meninges that in your brain and spinal cord. And they're

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:49.280
 basically a three layered envelope that protects your brain and spinal cord. And there's a delicate

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:54.480
 inner layer, which is called the peer meter, which means sort of tender mother or soft mother

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:59.840
 or pious mother. And so that wraps around the brain and spinal cord a bit like cling film.

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:04.560
 And then there's a really tough outer layer, which is just under the bone of your skull. And that's

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:10.080
 a dura mater, the hard mother, tough mother. And then there's a middle layer, the arachnoid

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:15.440
 mater. And that's like a network of tissues and the tissue sort of spread out like a spider's web.

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:22.480
 So really, it should be called a spider web mother, but it's not. The meninges is, you know,

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:27.440
 a baby at the top of their head, they have like a gap where the skull hasn't covered them up. Oh,

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:32.800
 yeah. The meninges is the kind of tough stuff that covers their brain, which means that at least

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:36.480
 the brain isn't sticking out of the head. That's interesting. I don't know that. And also that

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:40.160
 little hole there, that is what the company baby gap is named after.

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:46.160
 I was just looking at sort of things that happen in the brain, unusual processes and things like

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:51.760
 that. Yeah, I really like this. Your brain is so fast that you can judge whether someone is

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:56.480
 trustworthy or not, even if you haven't seen them consciously. Okay. So they tried this thing where

00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:00.320
 they showed people images for it like a fraction of it, like a millisecond, a couple of milliseconds,

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:06.000
 right? Too fast for people to consciously register they had seen a face. Yeah. They were either faces

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.120
 that were, you know, untrustworthy looking or trustworthy looking or whatever. I don't know

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:14.560
 what the criteria were. What is that? Is it like one person they've got, you know, a fag out the

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:21.440
 corner of their mouth and a big overcoat on? And a bag-tank swag. Yeah. No, I have no idea. Maybe

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:24.640
 they had to assess from people what they found trustworthy or untrustworthy first. Because

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:28.000
 some people might only trust people who look like sort of comedy burglars from the 1980s.

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:32.560
 But when they showed them those images, even for a fraction of a second, they didn't consciously

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:37.120
 see them. But the bit of their brain, the amygdala, which processes strong emotions,

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:41.280
 particularly in relation to whether you trust someone or not, fired up. Wow. It's not weird.

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:46.400
 Wow. Do you know what the amygdala means? Ormond. Yeah. The brain is just full of

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:51.200
 weirdly named stuff because it's like a structure and people could look at it hundreds of years ago

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:55.280
 if they took out someone's brain after they died and like name the bits of the structure. It's just

00:05:55.280 --> 00:06:01.680
 got all really old fashioned, odd names. Like almond. Seahorse. Indeed. Oh yeah, the seahorse.

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:06.320
 Because like if you are looking at someone's brain and you're like, which bit do I need to take out?

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:11.600
 And they say, well, it's the blood, blood, fontanelle or whatever. You wouldn't know what it was. But if

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:15.520
 you say the seahorse, you can look at it and go, oh, that looks a bit like a seahorse. I'll take

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:22.560
 that bit out. Yeah. And the martyr, the pia martyr and the other martyrs, they're named after the

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:29.520
 facts that they kind of cover things like a mother might hold her baby. They come from the Arabic.

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:32.720
 Wow. I wondered with the speed that you were talking about a second ago, Andy,

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:38.400
 the like, I was just thinking a quiz show, right? How quickly does the answer come to you

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:42.560
 prior to your finger, the information getting to your finger and you pressing a buzzer, right?

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:47.200
 If you were able to hook up your brain to the bit that lights up that says you know the answer,

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:51.200
 how quick could it be? Are you pitching a quiz where no one actually asks the questions and

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:56.240
 people just buzzing and say, no, no, you need the question. Are you thinking like you're going

00:06:56.240 --> 00:07:00.720
 university challenge, everyone else is using their fingers like absolute noobs and you've

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:03.920
 got something attached to your actual brain. Competitive advantage. You've got your head on

00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:11.360
 the button. Exactly. That's it. I look like I'm keeled over, but no. Shriver Australia.

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:18.080
 The only flaw in your plan is that you actually wouldn't know any of the answers anyway. So

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:24.720
 it doesn't matter how you're pressing the button. I've genuinely never got an answer right on a

00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:28.480
 university challenge. No, I think that's good. But they show you the question for a millisecond

00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:32.960
 at the part of your brain associated with Turkmenistan fires, then it's actually a team of

00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:38.400
 neuroscientists who answer the question for you. But like several days later after the analysis.

00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:43.040
 But is the kind of thing your brain does and mostly I associate this sort of thing with

00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:49.760
 that, you know, there's that split brain operation that used to be done on epileptic

00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:54.960
 people. It was like, it was a revolutionary operation. And you basically cut the brain

00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:58.720
 in half down the corpus callosum, which is a bit that splits the left side from the right side of

00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:03.840
 the brain. And it was amazing because it stopped people having epileptic fits when nothing else

00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:09.280
 would work. They did loads of experiments on these people whose two brains were working fine,

00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:12.880
 but they couldn't communicate with each other. And so the reason I thought, for instance, of that

00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:18.880
 university challenge thing was that someone who'd had that operation, they would be shown a picture

00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:24.400
 of a face to their right eye, which goes into the left hemisphere. And they're asked what they've

00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:29.520
 seen. And they can say face. But if it goes into the other eye and into the opposite hemisphere,

00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:33.040
 because it's going to the wrong hemisphere that doesn't process language, once they're asked

00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:37.600
 what they've seen, they can't say face, but they can draw a face. I mean, the language is still

00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:42.240
 completely fine. But they'll just say, I've got no idea what I've seen. But their hand will draw a

00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:47.280
 face. Here's my pitch. Yeah. It's a cop drama, right? And there's a witness to a crime, but you

00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:52.320
 only saw it with one eye, the eye which doesn't know what. But he can draw it. And you've got a

00:08:52.320 --> 00:09:00.480
 cop, but he's only got the other eye. Yes. And it's basically Pictionary, Pictionary cop. That's

00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:05.760
 actually really good. And that can be a sequel to Dictionary cop, which is... Oh, right. I thought

00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:11.840
 you're going to be like Buckaroo cop, Mousetrap cop. Jenga cop. He's got two hours to stop this

00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:17.440
 building falling over. Yeah. It's not got any mortar. It's just bricks. But you know, fine.

00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:22.560
 It's a dry stone building. And one of the bricks has got a bomb in it, but he doesn't know which

00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:27.200
 one. So he has to keep removing the bricks to find the bomb without the building falling down.

00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:31.440
 But it's in a very congested area. So he can only put the bricks on top of the building at the top.

00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:38.560
 This is quite good. Dry stone wall is probably set at the Cotswolds. So he's had some lovely

00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:44.640
 location filming before the... Yeah, yeah. This is bloody good. Jenga cop. There is just one

00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:51.760
 other possible spy film, follow up, where you can basically get people to say things that they

00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:55.280
 don't know they've said, I guess, because there was another guy who'd had his brain cut in half.

00:09:55.280 --> 00:09:59.840
 And they asked him the question to one side of his brain. They flashed the question,

00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:04.320
 who's your favourite girlfriend? He was a little boy. Oh, right. Who's your favourite girlfriend?

00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:07.440
 And then he was asked, do you know what question we've asked you? And he was shrugged and was like,

00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:12.560
 no, I haven't seen anything. I didn't see anything. But then he giggled, said no,

00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:16.880
 and then spelled out Liz in Scrabble Tiles with his other hand. How awful is that? You're just

00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:21.520
 giving stuff away. Scrabble Tiles, 10 points as well for the Zed. He put on a triple hurt score

00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:27.680
 as well. Well, it makes you a follow up. Scrabble cop. Scrabble cop. That's good.

00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:31.840
 Have you guys heard of hemmy neglect, which is kind of in the same sphere here? Hemmy neglect.

00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:36.400
 Hemmy neglect is when this is people who have had a stroke. There's a bit of brain damage that

00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:42.640
 goes on whereby they only experience basically one side of their visual field. So if they've gone

00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:47.280
 to shave, they'll shave off half their face, but leave the other side because it's just not

00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:50.800
 part of their field anymore, right? If they're eating on a plate, they'll eat the right side

00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:54.320
 or left side of the plate. They'll eat just one side of the plate. So it's not just that you can't

00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:57.360
 see presumably, it's that your brain refuses to acknowledge that. Your brain is refusing to

00:10:57.360 --> 00:11:02.240
 acknowledge that. Yeah. But this is what's amazing. They started looking into hemmy neglect within

00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:08.160
 memory as well. So they managed to find a group of people where all of them had been to Milan.

00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:12.320
 So they asked them the exact same thing, you're standing in the major plaza in Milan,

00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:16.000
 recall as many stores and streets around you as possible in the square,

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:20.800
 and they could only remember the stores and the streets that were on the right side and not the

00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:24.960
 left. Probably good memories though. He asked me to name a shop, you know, on a square I'd lived on

00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:29.040
 for about 20 years. I probably couldn't do it. I could name a shop in Milan in the central square

00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:34.800
 but yeah, because they recently got their first Starbucks and it was some controversy because

00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:40.400
 obviously Milan, the home of coffee, good coffee, and there was a Starbucks there. It was very nice

00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:45.040
 Starbucks too. So that prompted a bit of local discussion. Or according to these people, there

00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:52.720
 was a Bucks. Yeah. All of our brains are smaller than they would have been 3,000 years ago if we'd

00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:58.000
 been born then. We've lost about four ping pong balls worth of brain. Whoa, that's a lot. It is

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:03.600
 quite a lot and it's not exactly clear what caused it because we invented agriculture 10,000 years

00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:08.480
 ago as a species. It's not that. Writing dates back several thousand years and it might be something

00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:12.560
 to do with that. It might be that I keep part of my brain in all of your brains.

00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:18.960
 I wonder what that was. No, but like if you have lots of division of labor and you have a complicated

00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:22.640
 system, you sort of divide up the cognitive tasks and you need a bit less brain space. Yeah. I think

00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:27.280
 there is a theory that domestication makes your brain smaller because it works with animals for

00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:31.600
 sure. So am I domesticated? Well, I think humans are domesticated, aren't we? Well, no, we're the

00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:36.560
 domesticators. But who's domesticated us, aside from cat, according to some interpretation.

00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:44.240
 The man. The man. Society has domesticated us. To be fair, I don't think I would thrive in the

00:12:44.240 --> 00:12:49.680
 wild. I don't think you would either. I concur. Dan, anything to do with you? Do you contradict that

00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:54.720
 statement? No, I think well, I'm going off getting some berries and Anna's going off killing a wild

00:12:54.720 --> 00:13:00.000
 cat. And you are trying to think of some cop dramas. I don't know which of us is going to be the most

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:06.000
 useful in the group. In the future, we will need cop dramas to survive. We'll need that hope that

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:13.360
 comes from like, will you find the bomb? Yeah. Okay, brain fart. Yeah. Like when you have a moment,

00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:18.000
 you can't remember something, right? Yeah. Yeah. This podcast has been a 10 year long one, for

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:25.360
 instance. Sure. Yeah. What about a brain squared? What is that? Brain squared time. It's where you

00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:30.160
 try and think of one thing, and it just shoves out tons of different things. It's like, someone

00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:34.480
 says, what's the capital of Malawi? And all you can think of is every other capital in Africa.

00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:39.440
 Oh, good. Yes. No, I was saying, yeah, that's probably closer than to mine, which you would be

00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:46.800
 saying things that sounded right as a ramble. So like a quiz question like that. But you genuinely

00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:52.640
 went, it's Michael's, no, Sarah, Joey, Chandler, right? Mums do when they're trying to remember

00:13:52.640 --> 00:14:01.200
 your name. They always run through, don't they? John, Katie, Claire, Hannah, James, James, come over

00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:07.040
 here. It's just a feeble or abortive attempt at reasoning, but it dates back to the 1650s.

00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:12.000
 They're cool. Really? I'm having a brain squirt. It was also, this dates back to Old English,

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:18.240
 your brain locker. What is that? Brain locker. Brain locker. It's someone who looks at a brain

00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:24.480
 in South Africa. It's my brain locker. It's just your head. I was going to say, it's your skull.

00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:30.480
 My brain locker. My brain locker. Crazy that we had a word for that. It's like one little hack. I was

00:14:30.480 --> 00:14:34.720
 reading a lot of neuroscientists saying how you can hack your brain to make sure that, so if you're

00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:38.240
 someone who forgets things a lot, or you have something important that you need to remember,

00:14:38.240 --> 00:14:42.960
 and you just don't, you can't find it, write it down or anything, take something, take an object,

00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:46.960
 and just place it somewhere it shouldn't be. So if you're leaving the house, for example,

00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:52.320
 and you're like, oh, why is this, you know, flute here? Yeah. It'll make you go, ah, yes,

00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:57.440
 I've been meaning to do that thing. It's a way of associating with a physical object. So that's

00:14:57.440 --> 00:15:01.360
 just a great hack. I feel like, you know, I do that with my hair bands. I put one hair band on

00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:04.320
 the other wrist if I need to remember something. I'll be the second one on the other wrist if I

00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:07.680
 need to remember a second thing. And then I put one back on the first wrist if I need to remember

00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:21.600
 a third thing. Oh, shit. Okay, it is time for fact number two. And that is my fact. My fact this

00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:28.400
 week is that at the 1984 US Grand Prix, it was thought that Ayrton Senna crashed into a wall

00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:35.120
 on the 47th lap. But it turns out it was actually the wall that crashed into him. This is another

00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:43.440
 case of a Jenga cop, I feel. This is an amazing story. So Senna is one of the greatest Formula

00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:48.160
 1 drivers ever. His career was cut short, because sadly, 10 years later, he did have a crash in a

00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:56.480
 Grand Prix, which he died. So basically, he was in this Grand Prix, and he's heading on cutting a

00:15:56.480 --> 00:16:01.920
 corner, very tight to the wall as he had done on previous laps. He nicks it. So afterwards,

00:16:01.920 --> 00:16:07.600
 they're talking about it, and he says, "There's no way I hit that wall. I'm a precision driver."

00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:14.320
 And he was very cocky, Senna. "I'm a precision driver. That wall came into me." So they went out

00:16:14.320 --> 00:16:18.560
 just because, I guess, you know, they thought, "Well, maybe he's right. Let's check it out." And

00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:23.680
 they noticed that the wall had moved. And the reason was, is because a car-

00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:27.680
 Is a human dressed as a wall, wasn't it? Who was hiding from the Jenga cop?

00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:31.920
 But it was also saying anti-Catholic propaganda at the time, wasn't it?

00:16:31.920 --> 00:16:40.240
 Cool. Back to last episode, everyone. So basically, these walls were giant,

00:16:40.240 --> 00:16:45.840
 concrete blocks. And on a previous lap, a car had also hit this wall. And what they'd notice

00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:50.720
 was that it hit it with such force that it had knocked the back of it. And so the front bit

00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:58.560
 jutted out a tiny bit, but only by 10 millimeters is what they were saying that he was so precise.

00:16:58.560 --> 00:17:02.400
 He was so precise that that was enough. He knew exactly where he needed to take it.

00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:07.680
 And so he nicked the wall. And this is how he is sort of known. He's known as this guy.

00:17:07.680 --> 00:17:15.040
 He was the best. I believe so. I mean, there's countless arguments in Formula One fans, but

00:17:15.040 --> 00:17:19.120
 for me, he was the best. There you go. You heard it here first.

00:17:19.120 --> 00:17:22.880
 So tragically, because he was cut off in his prime, we don't know where he would have taken it to.

00:17:22.880 --> 00:17:28.080
 He won three world championships. He's been surpassed by Schumacher and others,

00:17:28.080 --> 00:17:32.480
 but that's because of the longevity of a career. So yeah, hard to know where he would have gone.

00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:39.360
 I didn't know why it's called Formula One. And it's just the whole point of Formula One is that

00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:43.840
 there is a formula. And it's this set of rules that you have to adhere to. And they change the

00:17:43.840 --> 00:17:47.680
 rules every, I don't know, every year or every couple of years. And then everyone has to build

00:17:47.680 --> 00:17:51.280
 entirely new cars and it's a nightmare. And that is the formula that everyone's complying with.

00:17:51.280 --> 00:17:54.960
 And that's about the weight and the aerodynamics and the blah, blah, blah. And I used to know,

00:17:54.960 --> 00:18:00.560
 what I do know, someone, a friend of mine, used to work on Formula One doing the kind of modelling,

00:18:00.560 --> 00:18:06.000
 the computer modelling of the aerodynamics of the cars. Basically, you just do that hundreds of

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:10.320
 thousands of times and modelling the airflow over a car to work out what's going to be best.

00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:15.680
 And then they change the rules and then you have to adjust everything in a fraction of a millimeter

00:18:15.680 --> 00:18:20.560
 in all of this. It's amazing. And try and push it slightly further than everyone else is pushing it.

00:18:20.560 --> 00:18:25.360
 Yeah, because there must be one perfect car, theoretically. Oh, right. That would be the,

00:18:25.360 --> 00:18:30.080
 have the perfect aerodynamics for these rules. I don't know. And they all cross the line at the

00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:39.680
 same time. That's when you have to bring in some variables like Mario Kart. The Red Shells. The

00:18:39.680 --> 00:18:49.440
 Benefit. Rainbow Road. A bubble that you drive into. Blop, blop, blop. I mean, it would all liven up

00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:54.560
 what is sometimes quite a dry sport to watch. It is very, this is, I think, true of quite a lot

00:18:54.560 --> 00:18:58.880
 of sports, which is if you're not really into them and you watch them, they seem quite boring on the

00:18:58.880 --> 00:19:02.560
 outside. And then as soon as you start reading about them, it's like, oh my God, this is incredible.

00:19:02.560 --> 00:19:06.400
 Yeah, that's definitely true of everyone, isn't it? Otherwise, it is just people going round and

00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:10.480
 round at a thing. But yeah, you can't make the cars too good. And obviously, there are rules to

00:19:10.480 --> 00:19:14.240
 stop you doing that. Partly for safety, because if you go too fast, it's very bad. And safety has

00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:19.520
 massively cracked down the last sort of 30 years. But there have been great cars made in the past

00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:23.280
 that they've had to change the rules to stop happening again, like the six-wheeled car.

00:19:23.280 --> 00:19:28.320
 Do we have the six-wheeled? Yeah, it's so cool. It's amazing. Was it designed by Homer Simpson?

00:19:28.320 --> 00:19:35.440
 Yes, it was. No, this was in the 1970s. And it was Tyrell, one of the teams,

00:19:35.440 --> 00:19:39.840
 raced a six-wheeled car. Realised that there would be an advantage to it, because if you have

00:19:39.840 --> 00:19:44.000
 four smaller wheels at the front rather than two big wheels, then I think you increase the amount

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:50.400
 of contact with the ground. So you've got more grip on the road. More traction on the corners.

00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:55.360
 Honestly, that is like, they've got someone in from the outside who's never worked in

00:19:55.360 --> 00:19:59.360
 Formula One before and said, look at this. How can we improve this car? And they've gone,

00:19:59.360 --> 00:20:04.000
 "More wheels?" Imagine being in that meeting, though. They were looking through it. We've

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:08.000
 looked through the manual 30 times now. There's nothing which says the maximum number of wheels

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:12.320
 is for you. You can do it. That must be something in the rules, something. That must be every other

00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:16.800
 car ever. They didn't think of putting it in the rules. It's like saying you can't have a crocodile

00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:22.000
 driving. They didn't think of that. There is no rule about the number of wheels, largely because

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:25.440
 they did this. And at the time, there were various slight problems with it, because they hadn't

00:20:25.440 --> 00:20:30.000
 perfected the technology yet, because they'd only just invented the six-wheeled car. They did get a

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:34.960
 few podium finishes, I think, for that car. But the FIA banned it in the end, because they worried

00:20:34.960 --> 00:20:38.480
 that we'd just get to a place where people were putting more and more wheels on cars. You just

00:20:38.480 --> 00:20:44.400
 have 100 wheels on a car. I think they did win. They won one Grand Prix with the Swedish Grand Prix.

00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:47.760
 What a vindication that must have been. What a moment.

00:20:47.760 --> 00:20:53.680
 Are the cars longer? Because that's an advantage as well, right? For tight finishes. If your car is

00:20:53.680 --> 00:20:59.280
 suddenly 10 metres long. I think of one problem is when you go into the pit stop to change your

00:20:59.280 --> 00:21:06.160
 tyres. If you have to change 200 times, it's going to take ages. Oh, those are... I love the pit

00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:09.680
 stops. Yeah. Those are the... Because that's a matter of variation in the race, isn't it? And they

00:21:09.680 --> 00:21:14.320
 used to have a lollipop man. Yeah. It's so sweet, really. It's really sad that they don't anymore,

00:21:14.320 --> 00:21:18.000
 I think. Because they always build the tracks next to primary schools.

00:21:22.960 --> 00:21:28.640
 But I do wonder. You just got a little old lady and a smart... He's chatting to some of the mums

00:21:28.640 --> 00:21:33.120
 and all the drivers and going, "Can I cross? Can I cross?" This pit stop has now lasted 18 minutes.

00:21:33.120 --> 00:21:39.280
 So their job basically was to know when everyone had finished their jobs and then they

00:21:39.280 --> 00:21:43.120
 lift up the lollipop and they could drive off. But now everyone just has a button. When you've

00:21:43.120 --> 00:21:46.640
 done your job, you finish your things and your lights change. Just rubbish. And that's... Oh,

00:21:46.640 --> 00:21:51.120
 that must be stressful as well. Because I can readily imagine fitting the wheel in 0.4 seconds

00:21:51.120 --> 00:21:55.200
 and then forgetting to press my button. Yeah. Well, if you had your head bugged on your left wrist,

00:21:55.200 --> 00:22:02.240
 here's a crazy pit stop thing that you're not allowed to do anymore, which is... And do you

00:22:02.240 --> 00:22:06.960
 guys remember ages ago, Lewis Hamilton, there was a bit of controversy about one of the races where

00:22:06.960 --> 00:22:13.360
 you have your team. So he's... What's his team again? He's with... Mercedes. So he'd be on the track

00:22:13.360 --> 00:22:17.680
 with another Mercedes rider, part of the same team. It made more sense for Lewis to win. So there was

00:22:17.680 --> 00:22:21.600
 this big controversy that the guy in the lead slowed down and let Lewis take the win for the

00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:27.280
 points for the team, basically. It is fine, but it's seen as... It's not sport, basically. It's...

00:22:27.280 --> 00:22:30.960
 They should be trying. Yeah. But they do the same in cycling, don't they? I thought they

00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:35.680
 happened to have one. In cycling, it's basically the whole spot. Yeah. I think in Formula One, it's

00:22:35.680 --> 00:22:40.240
 obviously taboo because it was a big controversy at the time when Lewis did it. Yeah. But so what

00:22:40.240 --> 00:22:45.760
 you used to be able to do in a pit stop is, let's say you have damaged your car. Yeah. You could

00:22:45.760 --> 00:22:49.920
 come in and they've called over the number two because you're the lead driver and they would

00:22:49.920 --> 00:22:55.280
 just give you his car. Wicked. So he would be out of the race. So your number two driver, you would

00:22:55.280 --> 00:23:00.640
 want them to be pretty much exactly the same as you, right? If you're six foot three with a very

00:23:00.640 --> 00:23:04.320
 spindly arms, you need another six foot three with spindly arms. Well, so you don't have to factor

00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:12.880
 around adjusting the seat and then changing the air con. Oh, radio one. But that is the thing,

00:23:12.880 --> 00:23:17.040
 isn't it? Because they all get weighed after the race. The driver and the car are weighed

00:23:17.040 --> 00:23:22.800
 because if you're too light, it might be dangerous and drivers lose about three kilos during a race

00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:26.960
 of hydration, of water weight. Because it's so sweaty, right? Yeah. It's so sweaty. It apparently

00:23:26.960 --> 00:23:30.560
 gets so hot in there as well. Like that's what's, you know, it's sweaty, it's hot, it's boiling,

00:23:30.560 --> 00:23:34.800
 and Damon Hill, there's a story. I couldn't find a good source for it, but it's claimed in a bunch

00:23:34.800 --> 00:23:41.600
 of places that he brings in, for some reason, a thermos of cold black tea and the heat of the car

00:23:41.600 --> 00:23:47.920
 makes it a nice piping hot tea for it to drink. I heard that. That's very funny. The safety stuff

00:23:47.920 --> 00:23:52.960
 is just nuts in the cars these days. It's so impressive. So these days, every single driver

00:23:52.960 --> 00:23:59.760
 has a monocoque. It was when they used to have two cars, there was so many deaths. It was tripping

00:23:59.760 --> 00:24:05.520
 over a lot. It's getting in the way of the levers. No, it's a cocoon, basically. It surrounds the

00:24:05.520 --> 00:24:10.800
 driver and it's sort of the core of the car. And it's like the, I want to say a very hard bag.

00:24:11.680 --> 00:24:15.920
 Like, it surrounds the driver and it keeps them safe even if they crash. So they get into a bag?

00:24:15.920 --> 00:24:21.440
 They didn't know. I'm misoldering dramatically. It's just like the sort of central command pod

00:24:21.440 --> 00:24:25.920
 of the car, which actually encases the driver. If you can imagine the meninges of the press,

00:24:25.920 --> 00:24:30.240
 it's almost like the meninges of the driver. Exactly. It's like the very toughest mother.

00:24:30.240 --> 00:24:34.640
 Only they called it that. I would have thrown it straight away. Yeah. And the, you know, the helmets

00:24:34.640 --> 00:24:39.200
 are amazing. They have to be subjected, the helmets have to be subjected to 800 degree heat for 45

00:24:39.200 --> 00:24:43.040
 seconds in case there's a fire or they have to be hot tea or hot tea.

00:24:43.040 --> 00:24:50.800
 The boss has really taken a pattering. Every time you blink, you lose 20 meters of road.

00:24:50.800 --> 00:24:54.720
 If you're going in fast Formula One car. So you have to be careful when you blink.

00:24:54.720 --> 00:24:58.400
 Yeah. They've measured it and like drivers always blink at the same part of the course.

00:24:58.400 --> 00:25:04.400
 It's really interesting. Yeah. I read that one thing that if you play the sounds of the cars

00:25:04.400 --> 00:25:08.960
 on a Formula One track to a Formula One driver, they'll be able to tell which track it is just

00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:12.720
 from the sounds that the cars make. Wow. Isn't that amazing? That's incredible.

00:25:12.720 --> 00:25:19.040
 You need a special driver's license? Oh really? Perhaps, unsurprisingly. You need a super license.

00:25:19.040 --> 00:25:24.720
 That's what it's called. Really? Yeah. Is that right? So does that mean if I took part in the Las Vegas

00:25:24.720 --> 00:25:29.680
 Grand Prix starts this weekend? Yeah. If I flew over to Las Vegas and took part in it, I'd get

00:25:29.680 --> 00:25:34.240
 points for not having the right license. I think you probably will get points. Yeah, yeah. Wow.

00:25:34.240 --> 00:25:40.720
 Do it anyway. I'll try it. Shall I try it? In your electric car as well. They accelerate like

00:25:40.720 --> 00:25:45.200
 that. They do accelerate well, but I'm not sure I could get around all the laps without retouching.

00:25:45.200 --> 00:25:51.600
 He's now had a lovely coffee at the Supercharger. I wonder if, you know, psychopaths is that idea

00:25:51.600 --> 00:25:57.360
 that they don't blink. I wonder if that would make you a better, there's one way apparently of spotting

00:25:57.360 --> 00:26:02.240
 a psychopath according to people who look into it is they blink much less than a regular person.

00:26:02.240 --> 00:26:05.200
 That's why they're forced to kill and kill again because they're so annoyed about their dry eyes.

00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:10.800
 I just wonder if you blink less. Are you a better driver? Are they all psychopaths? Is that what

00:26:10.800 --> 00:26:15.280
 you're saying? All these F1 drivers? Well, Senna, just back to him very quickly, sounded a bit

00:26:15.280 --> 00:26:22.080
 sort of like he was in an odd mental place a lot of the time. Well, as in like, whenever he arrived,

00:26:22.080 --> 00:26:26.000
 his friend said, he'd never said hi. Like if he was coming to a race, he was just in a zone. He was

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:31.440
 just always kind of like angry. That's like rude. God, I said hi to you this morning and it was an

00:26:31.440 --> 00:26:37.600
 effort, frankly, but I didn't. I think that's really normal. Like I would say if you're racing,

00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:42.160
 I can imagine not saying hello to anyone like you've got to be so in the zone. Yes. How many

00:26:42.160 --> 00:26:45.440
 people are you having to say hi to? Because if it's just one or two people who are welcoming you,

00:26:45.440 --> 00:26:48.560
 you're like, oh, yeah, great. You have a nice chat. But if it's like all the 50 members of the team

00:26:48.560 --> 00:26:56.480
 are saying, hello, I like the big mascot in the silly suit. This is according to someone who works

00:26:56.480 --> 00:27:02.720
 for the catering operation, Lindy Redding. She said she said he would never say hi if he was in the

00:27:02.720 --> 00:27:09.760
 zone. But when he did say hello, it was very genuine. He used to kiss us and hold our faces,

00:27:09.760 --> 00:27:15.840
 which was hugely intense, but absolutely lovely. You know what? Let's do the not hello next time.

00:27:15.840 --> 00:27:22.320
 This is great. That's the greeting equivalent of doing the washing up so badly that they never

00:27:22.320 --> 00:27:32.400
 asked. Speaking of motor racing drivers, have you guys heard of Hella nice? Hella nice.

00:27:32.400 --> 00:27:43.040
 Hella nice. Yeah. It was a person from the 1920s. Real name Mariette Ellen Delong. She was an exotic

00:27:43.040 --> 00:27:49.840
 dancer who danced at the Ritz in Paris. And then she had a skiing accident and couldn't dance anymore.

00:27:49.840 --> 00:27:56.160
 And so became a racing driver. And she raced in five major Grand Prix in France. And she was in

00:27:56.160 --> 00:27:59.360
 an accident. This is why I was reading about her because we were talking about safety. She was

00:27:59.360 --> 00:28:05.840
 in an accident where she was in an Alpha Romeo and she's somersaulted through the air. And she

00:28:05.840 --> 00:28:10.320
 wasn't wearing a seatbelt because she didn't have to in those days. Her car went into the crowd,

00:28:10.320 --> 00:28:15.920
 killed four people. But she survived because she landed on a soldier who absorbed the full

00:28:15.920 --> 00:28:23.120
 impact of her body saving her life. Did he die? No, he didn't die. Sorry, did she

00:28:23.120 --> 00:28:28.400
 fly through the air or did her car, her car went one direction, killed some people.

00:28:28.400 --> 00:28:33.760
 She went in the other direction and luckily landed on this very pliant soldier. Wow. And they later

00:28:33.760 --> 00:28:39.840
 married. I don't think they did now. That's amazing. It's incredible what you can survive. I mean,

00:28:39.840 --> 00:28:44.720
 now they really saw extraordinary crashes because of the safety. But even when you look back in the

00:28:44.720 --> 00:28:49.600
 day, I mean, in 1993, have you seen the quite a famous crash? Two teammates actually who were

00:28:49.600 --> 00:28:54.640
 called Fittipaldi and Martini. They were quite near the back. But one of their cars was like just

00:28:54.640 --> 00:28:58.640
 behind the other. And I think the left wheel, front wheel of one car nicked the back right

00:28:58.640 --> 00:29:04.560
 wheel of another car. And it sent the front one into a full in the air backflip. Oh yes, yeah.

00:29:04.560 --> 00:29:10.640
 Just does a backflip, happily lands, skates over the finish line. It's absolutely stunning. That

00:29:10.640 --> 00:29:15.120
 showboating. It really is, yeah. To begin with the headline, Martini shaken not stirred.

00:29:15.120 --> 00:29:24.320
 It should have done. Here's a little quiz moment for you all. Okay. Who is the guy who I think has

00:29:24.320 --> 00:29:28.800
 done more Formula One races than anyone else? I'm 90% sure. He's done more Formula One races

00:29:28.800 --> 00:29:34.800
 than anyone else on the planet, more Grand Prix. Grands Prix. Okay. So someone we must know of?

00:29:34.800 --> 00:29:40.080
 No. Is it the Michelin man? It's not the Michelin man. Anna, I feel like you might have the answer.

00:29:40.080 --> 00:29:45.040
 I've just got my hand up. I'm bursting. Are you talking about the safety guy? The guy who drives

00:29:45.040 --> 00:29:51.040
 the safety car. Yeah, so good. He's been doing it for nearly 25 years. Yeah. He's done more than 450

00:29:51.040 --> 00:29:55.200
 Grand Prix. I can't believe it's the same guy. I just couldn't believe it's just one bloke

00:29:55.200 --> 00:29:59.360
 doing every single Grand Prix. So what does he do, sorry? When there's an incident on the track.

00:29:59.360 --> 00:30:03.200
 Yeah. There's an accident or like there's a horse ride out on the track, whatever. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:30:03.200 --> 00:30:09.120
 School day finishes. Receptions run out, lady car ladies already.

00:30:09.760 --> 00:30:14.560
 The safety car drives out onto the track and kind of regulates the service. Everyone has to

00:30:14.560 --> 00:30:18.960
 drive slowly. Yeah, he drives around at 20 miles an hour and everyone has to just slowly go behind

00:30:18.960 --> 00:30:22.240
 them and you're not allowed to overtake anyone. Yes, of course. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You know that

00:30:22.240 --> 00:30:26.400
 feeling when you're driving and someone's kind of coming up your arse? Imagine that like times a

00:30:26.400 --> 00:30:31.680
 million. This is what that guy's going through every single day. Someone coming up his arse times

00:30:31.680 --> 00:30:43.040
 a million. That is a tough job. That was work today, darling. Well, 20 men coming up my arse.

00:30:43.040 --> 00:30:50.640
 Want to sit down? No, it's alright. It's alright. After 25 years, you're kind of, you're hard into it.

00:30:55.680 --> 00:31:08.080
 Okay, he's a professional racing driver. He's called Burt Maylender. That's great though. That's

00:31:08.080 --> 00:31:12.640
 really cool. I mean, I guess he's not had any accidents himself over all that time. So

00:31:12.640 --> 00:31:17.440
 I guess it's quite stressful and he says the most, can you guess the most stressful person to have

00:31:17.440 --> 00:31:23.280
 behind you? What is in which racing driver is? Yeah, because I said they're quite aggressive

00:31:23.280 --> 00:31:28.240
 sometimes. It must be Schumacher. It's actually Lewis Hamilton, he says. Lewis Hamilton's really

00:31:28.240 --> 00:31:33.360
 up in your face or I'm like zigzagging everywhere, like really pushing, going up towards you.

00:31:33.360 --> 00:31:37.920
 What was the point? You have to stay behind them. No, you keep your tyres warm by zigzagging.

00:31:37.920 --> 00:31:43.680
 I think it's the most precise sport in the world. You guys have just written a book about sports.

00:31:43.680 --> 00:31:52.240
 The big book of sports. Everything to play for, the QI book of sports. But surely this is the most,

00:31:52.240 --> 00:31:56.080
 this is where the most thought has gone into the most tiny differences of like,

00:31:56.080 --> 00:32:02.720
 yeah, it is amazing. Technologically for sure. Right. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. Like even in the formula,

00:32:02.720 --> 00:32:08.720
 there are even limits on the amount of data you're allowed to use to simulate the car aerodynamics.

00:32:08.720 --> 00:32:14.880
 You're limited to 25 teraflops of computing power when you're running the computer simulations

00:32:14.880 --> 00:32:19.520
 of air flowing over a car you haven't even built yet. And then after all that stuff,

00:32:19.520 --> 00:32:23.840
 like literally last night in the warm up for the Las Vegas Grand Prix,

00:32:23.840 --> 00:32:29.120
 someone hadn't nailed down one of the manhole covers properly, just smashed into the car.

00:32:29.120 --> 00:32:34.160
 Oh my God, I heard about that. They get sucked up. Yeah. Why do they keep building manhole covers

00:32:34.160 --> 00:32:40.960
 on the F1 tracks? Well, because it's it's in the actual streets of Las Vegas. And they have to

00:32:40.960 --> 00:32:44.720
 nail down every single manhole cover. I think they might not even use nails. They might use

00:32:44.720 --> 00:32:48.560
 like concrete or something. God, you don't want to be sort of a sewerage work who pops up at the

00:32:48.560 --> 00:32:55.520
 wrong one. Oh fuck. An escaped convict. Yeah, yeah. That's it, isn't it?

00:32:55.520 --> 00:33:08.800
 Okay, it is time for fact number three, and that is Andy. My fact is, there is such a thing

00:33:08.800 --> 00:33:21.040
 as a ghost pond. Oh, splash. Yeah. This is a, so we're all familiar with ponds. Maybe just give us

00:33:21.040 --> 00:33:28.000
 a just for the people not from the UK. Well, no, actually, then, because, you know, what is a pond

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:36.000
 and what is a lake? So it's a very large hill with just matter on it. Oh, no, it's the opposite

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:41.200
 of that. It's a small indentation with water in it. That's right. Sorry, I always get those mixed up.

00:33:41.200 --> 00:33:47.840
 Oh, you caught me there. You have me going. But basically, there are these things all over,

00:33:47.840 --> 00:33:51.280
 particularly the UK, but I'm sure in other countries too. In fact, all over Europe, they

00:33:51.280 --> 00:33:55.760
 do know that. And they, like all the farms in England used to have ponds, like fields would

00:33:55.760 --> 00:34:00.400
 have a pond here or there in them, and they would either provide water for cattle or they would,

00:34:00.400 --> 00:34:04.000
 you know, they're just useful things to have. But then over the years, they got abandoned

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:08.320
 and lots of them dried up. Oh, maybe they got choked by fallen leaves, you know, and all these

00:34:08.320 --> 00:34:13.840
 ponds are now missing from the UK. There used to be twice as many ponds as there are today in

00:34:13.840 --> 00:34:19.760
 the 1970s. Double the ponds. Yeah, I know. Like, why is no one marching? Why is no one superglaring

00:34:19.760 --> 00:34:24.800
 themselves to Heathrow Airport to bring the ponds back? Well, I think it's important that they're

00:34:24.800 --> 00:34:30.800
 like ponds are great because so many animals and plants just. They want to.

00:34:31.040 --> 00:34:38.720
 That was Dubai. Yeah.

00:34:38.720 --> 00:34:44.880
 That's right. I've got a pond. Have you got a pond? Anyone else got a pond?

00:34:44.880 --> 00:34:48.560
 I want to. It's on my list of things I'd like to do is to dig a pond. Very easy. Just dig a pond,

00:34:48.560 --> 00:34:52.080
 put some lining in it. Yeah. Sorry, can you just tell us what these ghost ponds are there?

00:34:52.080 --> 00:34:54.320
 Well, okay. So ghost ponds basically are about my pond.

00:34:54.320 --> 00:34:58.560
 Just tell us anything. We're passing the pond in a minute.

00:34:58.560 --> 00:35:02.560
 But no, basically, they're huge biodiversity hotspots. You know, you get you get plants and

00:35:02.560 --> 00:35:06.480
 species and dragonflies and beetles and all sorts of stuff where before you just have a field and

00:35:06.480 --> 00:35:11.840
 you know, they're really important for that. And basically the mud remembers. It's really weird.

00:35:11.840 --> 00:35:17.360
 So all of these ancient seeds might be left in the indentation that used to be a pond and they

00:35:17.360 --> 00:35:21.360
 can survive for over a century. And all you have to do if you have that little dip in the ground,

00:35:21.360 --> 00:35:26.720
 you refill it, expose it to sunlight and these old species just spring up and they come back

00:35:26.720 --> 00:35:31.360
 with a vengeance. And it's kind of staggering. So there's a team at UCL, the pond restoration

00:35:31.360 --> 00:35:35.760
 research group led by Carl Sayer, and they've been going around Norfolk restoring these ghost

00:35:35.760 --> 00:35:41.040
 ponds. And suddenly, bang, life, biodiversity, really important stuff, which is really under

00:35:41.040 --> 00:35:47.600
 threat at the moment. They reckon there's 600,000 that are hidden still waiting to be restored

00:35:47.600 --> 00:35:53.200
 in the UK alone. It's amazing. And it's longer than that, isn't it, for seeds? I'm sure we've

00:35:53.200 --> 00:35:58.160
 mentioned and I can't remember the exact number, but like the oldest seed ever found that can still

00:35:58.160 --> 00:36:02.960
 be, you know, watered and sunlit and grow is many thousands of years old. And so yeah, these can be

00:36:02.960 --> 00:36:09.200
 many hundreds. And what I really like is that you can sort of see a ghostly evidence of them,

00:36:09.200 --> 00:36:14.240
 can't you? Like from above, you can see it as like a slightly damp depression or it's a bit where

00:36:14.240 --> 00:36:18.400
 crops don't grow as well, because it's always been a bit too wet, the soils never dried out.

00:36:18.400 --> 00:36:23.360
 And I think often farmers, when they're expanding their land, rather than drain them, because that's

00:36:23.360 --> 00:36:27.200
 a hassle draining a pond, they just dump a load of earth in them, wouldn't they? Or a

00:36:27.200 --> 00:36:31.840
 load of plant matter, which doesn't stop them being wet. So they have left their little pond

00:36:31.840 --> 00:36:37.440
 prints. So cool. But also I think ponds, they kind of have like a life duration, don't they?

00:36:37.440 --> 00:36:42.160
 If you have a pond, like a pond farm, as you dig out a pond, right, because you're a farmer,

00:36:42.800 --> 00:36:48.640
 if you just leave it, after about 100 years, it'll just cease to be. Oh, really? Yeah, they just kind

00:36:48.640 --> 00:36:53.520
 of, they slowly silt up and silt up and silt up and then they die. And it could be just like one

00:36:53.520 --> 00:36:58.320
 really heavy rainstorm. A load of silt comes down, they're not a pond anymore. They're just like these

00:36:58.320 --> 00:37:01.680
 ephemeral things that kind of come and go. They have to be kind of maintained, don't they? A little

00:37:01.680 --> 00:37:04.640
 bit. They do. You clear out the leaves and you know, if they've got trees over them, that's a

00:37:04.640 --> 00:37:08.480
 nightmare for a pond, apparently. Sure is. Can I tell you about the leaves that have fallen into my

00:37:08.480 --> 00:37:13.200
 pond? Yeah. How big is your pond? Like the table that we're recording on. Okay, the one that no

00:37:13.200 --> 00:37:17.520
 one can see. It's about half the size of that. Oh, nice. Okay. James would describe something

00:37:17.520 --> 00:37:23.360
 the size of a basin. It's small. It's a small pond. But you know, it's just for animals to come and

00:37:23.360 --> 00:37:29.120
 drink stuff. You're not going to get a deer, are you? A lion kneeling down. I don't think there

00:37:29.120 --> 00:37:34.480
 will be wildebeest of lion sipping at my pond in North London. You're not that far from the zoo.

00:37:35.040 --> 00:37:39.840
 That's true. A catastrophic breakout and suddenly James looks out a watering hole.

00:37:39.840 --> 00:37:51.120
 Humans make ponds. What else makes ponds? Aliens. Yes, the equivalent of crop circles,

00:37:51.120 --> 00:37:58.160
 pond circles. Oh, lovely. Yeah, no, non-human animals. Non-human animals. Yes. I reckon like

00:37:58.160 --> 00:38:04.640
 if you're a hippo and you sit down in some mud, then it might create a pond. Good point. Whether

00:38:04.640 --> 00:38:10.000
 or not that would be intentional, I guess would be debated. I'm saying deliberate pond makers.

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:14.880
 Oh, beavers maybe. I guess they're damning things up. It's not really a pond. It's not quite. No.

00:38:14.880 --> 00:38:19.120
 So, Andy, if you want to get a pond in your backyard, but you can't be bothered digging,

00:38:19.120 --> 00:38:25.040
 buy yourself a Goliath frog. Oh, great. Yeah. So, Goliath frogs do this. It's a really interesting

00:38:25.040 --> 00:38:31.200
 thing where they move rocks, giant rocks, basically their own weight and they get it so that they cut

00:38:31.200 --> 00:38:36.480
 off water and they build their own ponds so that the eggs are more safe in there. They can keep

00:38:36.480 --> 00:38:40.080
 attention to them, make sure the tadpoles and so on are all in place. They're their biggest

00:38:40.080 --> 00:38:44.320
 frogs, aren't they? The Goliath frog. If for the people at home who can't see it, there's a glass

00:38:44.320 --> 00:38:48.000
 of water in front of them, they're probably about two or three times bigger than that. Yeah,

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:51.760
 they're massive, really big. And they think one of the, you know, there's always theories, but one

00:38:51.760 --> 00:38:56.160
 of the theories is that their size is to do with mating, to do with the best rock movers and, you

00:38:56.160 --> 00:39:00.240
 know, that's partially why they may be that big, specifically because they build ponds.

00:39:00.240 --> 00:39:06.160
 Do you know what else makes ponds? So, this is a subset of humans. Oh, okay, I was about to say

00:39:06.160 --> 00:39:12.320
 elephants. And schoolgirls. Subset of humans. That wasn't what I was thinking of. That can

00:39:12.320 --> 00:39:16.720
 as a subset, though. That's a subset of humans. Why? Are you questioning whether or not they're

00:39:16.720 --> 00:39:20.960
 humans? I wasn't sure what subset meant. I thought it meant it had to be like people

00:39:20.960 --> 00:39:25.360
 from, you know, the southern hemisphere or like, I thought it was bigger than just saying, you know,

00:39:25.360 --> 00:39:31.200
 slipknot fans, you know. Yeah, just a group of humans who make ponds. You used to be a schoolgirl.

00:39:31.200 --> 00:39:35.520
 I was trying to think of what a subset of humans would be. Oh, okay. I was just wondering if when

00:39:35.520 --> 00:39:38.960
 you were a schoolgirl, you dug ponds and that you had inside knowledge that I wouldn't have had.

00:39:38.960 --> 00:39:44.640
 No, we got taken to ponds. So, we got told about newt. So, not schoolgirls.

00:39:44.640 --> 00:39:51.280
 A subset of humans who make ponds. Is it a profession? No, it's more of a ideology.

00:39:51.280 --> 00:39:56.480
 Zen gardeners. Oh, okay. That is true, undoubtedly. Not who I was thinking of.

00:39:56.480 --> 00:40:04.480
 Communists. Oh, the opposite. Oh, fascists. Nazis. Yes, you got it. So, there's quite a lot

00:40:04.480 --> 00:40:11.040
 of bomb craters around Europe. And if you drop a bomb, it makes a big indentation and that indentation

00:40:11.040 --> 00:40:18.080
 can then collect water and become a pond. Wow. So, that feels like a silver lining.

00:40:18.080 --> 00:40:20.800
 It is, really. And possibly a reason to start more wars.

00:40:20.800 --> 00:40:27.440
 No. I mean, well, just the Nazis were pond making, right? The Allies were pond making as well. We

00:40:27.440 --> 00:40:32.560
 were all pond making. A lot of ponds in Dresden. Right, right, right. But yeah, a lot of ponds made

00:40:32.560 --> 00:40:38.320
 by both sides. And the thing is that they've done some studies on it and they did this in Hungary

00:40:38.320 --> 00:40:47.520
 in particular. And they found that they found 274 species in ponds made by bombs. And they included

00:40:47.520 --> 00:40:53.600
 like, for instance, an algae which has previously only been found in Chilean salt lakes.

00:40:53.600 --> 00:41:00.080
 And a furry shrimp that had only been recorded twice in the last 25 years in Hungary. And they

00:41:00.080 --> 00:41:04.000
 were in these ponds made by bombs. That's amazing. I mean, this is what they find with these ghost

00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:08.240
 ponds when they rejuvenate them. You get species that you haven't seen for many, many years. And

00:41:08.240 --> 00:41:13.520
 it's such a mystery, I think, how stuff turns up, how nature knows. And particularly, I think,

00:41:13.520 --> 00:41:18.640
 in slightly bigger ponds than maybe James's garden pond. But you'll find, no offense.

00:41:18.640 --> 00:41:22.640
 I can't even imagine a pond bigger than James's garden pond.

00:41:22.640 --> 00:41:26.080
 Please don't write in for me taking the piss up, James, having a small pond, okay?

00:41:26.080 --> 00:41:30.080
 Okay, here we are. New name for this podcast. Don't write in.

00:41:30.080 --> 00:41:34.320
 I was the eels.

00:41:34.320 --> 00:41:38.080
 James Harkin's podcast. Do you reckon?

00:41:38.080 --> 00:41:42.000
 Yeah. Come on, give us that. You will need a bit more detail, but I'm interested.

00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:45.440
 Okay, first episode, guess what leaves are falling in my pond?

00:41:45.440 --> 00:41:47.440
 Are you having a guest to your pond each week?

00:41:47.440 --> 00:41:49.600
 Yeah, but they'll be an animal, so they can't talk.

00:41:49.600 --> 00:41:53.520
 First episode of Dragonfly, and they just go...

00:41:53.520 --> 00:42:01.360
 Monaco. We have to guess what animal is at your pond chat that week.

00:42:01.360 --> 00:42:02.160
 Yeah, that's great.

00:42:02.160 --> 00:42:03.440
 It's almost always a snail.

00:42:03.440 --> 00:42:06.480
 It's never the world of bees, guys.

00:42:06.480 --> 00:42:10.080
 So I always have eels in ponds, because how did they get there?

00:42:10.080 --> 00:42:10.880
 Oh, yeah.

00:42:10.880 --> 00:42:15.360
 And all we know is that eels can move across sort of...

00:42:15.360 --> 00:42:16.880
 Not dry land, but across land.

00:42:16.880 --> 00:42:20.000
 That's moist, because they can breathe through their skin, not just gills.

00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:24.400
 So gills require some pressure for the water to be forced in,

00:42:24.400 --> 00:42:25.920
 but they can actually breathe through their skin.

00:42:25.920 --> 00:42:28.720
 So they must just flop out of a river,

00:42:28.720 --> 00:42:30.320
 but then how do they find their way to someone's garden?

00:42:30.320 --> 00:42:32.640
 Everyone's looking at me just to say no eels in my pond.

00:42:32.640 --> 00:42:34.960
 Oh, that'll be a big, big episode.

00:42:34.960 --> 00:42:35.920
 All in my hovercraft.

00:42:37.120 --> 00:42:41.760
 I think it's not an idea that sometimes things get in ponds because they're dropped by birds.

00:42:41.760 --> 00:42:46.640
 Can I tell you about one of the most interesting ponds in the world?

00:42:46.640 --> 00:42:47.200
 Please.

00:42:47.200 --> 00:42:52.480
 This is called Don Juan Pond in Antarctica, and it's really weird.

00:42:52.480 --> 00:42:55.200
 It's quite... It's very big. That's not the way of thing.

00:42:55.200 --> 00:42:56.800
 It's full of water. That's not the way of thing either.

00:42:56.800 --> 00:42:59.920
 Well, it's in Antarctica, so being full of water is unusual.

00:42:59.920 --> 00:43:01.760
 Exactly. That is the way of thing.

00:43:01.760 --> 00:43:03.200
 And it's because of what this water is like.

00:43:03.200 --> 00:43:08.400
 It's really dense and really syrupy, and it's full of calcium chloride.

00:43:08.400 --> 00:43:10.240
 It's kind of salt, right?

00:43:10.240 --> 00:43:14.880
 And the water remains liquid, even 50 degrees below freezing.

00:43:14.880 --> 00:43:17.600
 Even 50 Celsius below zero.

00:43:17.600 --> 00:43:20.000
 What's that all about?

00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:22.480
 Well, it's because it's the most salty body of water in the world, isn't it?

00:43:22.480 --> 00:43:24.480
 Exactly. And they don't know where the water comes from.

00:43:24.480 --> 00:43:26.240
 I read an interview with a scientist who said,

00:43:26.240 --> 00:43:27.840
 "We've been studying it for 60 years.

00:43:27.840 --> 00:43:30.800
 We're pretty sure it's fed from beneath, but we're not totally certain."

00:43:30.800 --> 00:43:36.160
 And what does the cold feel like if it's gone beyond the point of where it freezes into a block?

00:43:36.160 --> 00:43:37.120
 Oh, I imagine it's very cold.

00:43:37.120 --> 00:43:37.920
 I bet, right?

00:43:37.920 --> 00:43:39.440
 Yeah.

00:43:39.440 --> 00:43:41.200
 You need a wet season.

00:43:41.200 --> 00:43:44.240
 Well, let's say you're swimming in regular water.

00:43:44.240 --> 00:43:46.320
 It freezes, right? So you can't dive into it.

00:43:46.320 --> 00:43:47.760
 It's a nice block. You can't get in there, right?

00:43:47.760 --> 00:43:49.680
 Yes. I know what you mean, but you will have been outside

00:43:49.680 --> 00:43:51.600
 in the air temperatures lower than zero.

00:43:51.600 --> 00:43:52.480
 Yeah, but... Oh, yeah.

00:43:52.480 --> 00:43:56.720
 No, I'm just curious what water, just the feeling, the sensation of the...

00:43:56.720 --> 00:43:58.880
 It's really, really cold.

00:43:58.880 --> 00:44:00.720
 I think it's just the only way anyone can...

00:44:00.720 --> 00:44:01.680
 I don't think anyone...

00:44:01.680 --> 00:44:04.080
 But no one must have ever jumped into this pond, because they would have died.

00:44:04.080 --> 00:44:04.640
 There we go.

00:44:04.640 --> 00:44:08.880
 Here's what's interesting about that thing is you would be able to lie down in there

00:44:08.880 --> 00:44:12.160
 and read a newspaper like in the Dead Sea, because it's so salty, I guess.

00:44:12.160 --> 00:44:15.200
 Oh, because you float right on top of it.

00:44:15.200 --> 00:44:16.400
 Yeah, yeah, you wouldn't sink.

00:44:16.400 --> 00:44:19.840
 Could you concentrate on what you were reading for how fucking cold it is?

00:44:19.840 --> 00:44:25.200
 Some trickier Guardian articles might be able to stretch.

00:44:25.200 --> 00:44:27.440
 Like the long read, you wouldn't get through.

00:44:27.440 --> 00:44:30.000
 That's some quick bites in the sun, it'd probably be fine.

00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:32.960
 You know Vespasian, the Roman emperor?

00:44:32.960 --> 00:44:37.760
 He heard about the Dead Sea, and he heard that people just float in it,

00:44:37.760 --> 00:44:40.400
 but he didn't believe it, and he didn't want to try it himself,

00:44:40.400 --> 00:44:43.520
 so he just got prisoners thrown into it to see what would happen.

00:44:43.520 --> 00:44:44.640
 Oh, wow.

00:44:44.640 --> 00:44:45.360
 And they floated.

00:44:45.360 --> 00:44:46.400
 They floated, yeah.

00:44:46.400 --> 00:44:49.360
 I will say, in case you're just going to book a trip,

00:44:49.360 --> 00:44:52.080
 that probably don't A, right now, but B,

00:44:52.080 --> 00:44:54.880
 in case you were going to book a trip to the Dead Sea to float, disappointing.

00:44:55.200 --> 00:44:55.920
 And a sank.

00:44:55.920 --> 00:44:58.640
 That was quite sinky.

00:44:58.640 --> 00:44:59.680
 It's a nice review.

00:44:59.680 --> 00:45:00.880
 One star sank.

00:45:00.880 --> 00:45:03.600
 You had a big lunch.

00:45:03.600 --> 00:45:15.680
 Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show, and that is James.

00:45:15.680 --> 00:45:18.480
 Okay, my fact this week is that in 1912,

00:45:18.480 --> 00:45:22.320
 the woman with the most perfect feet in America was devast

00:45:22.320 --> 00:45:25.920
 because her husband was jealous of all the attention she was getting.

00:45:25.920 --> 00:45:27.440
 Really?

00:45:27.440 --> 00:45:28.960
 It's relatable.

00:45:28.960 --> 00:45:30.560
 James, can I just say?

00:45:30.560 --> 00:45:32.400
 Is that because you got such amazing feet?

00:45:32.400 --> 00:45:34.080
 Or because you want to deposit your mind?

00:45:34.080 --> 00:45:39.760
 Can I just say, James, this was an impossible fact to research.

00:45:39.760 --> 00:45:43.760
 When you Google "nice feet" or "perfect feet" in America,

00:45:43.760 --> 00:45:46.800
 oh my goodness, there's a lot of stuff to get through first,

00:45:46.800 --> 00:45:48.160
 before you find out about--

00:45:48.160 --> 00:45:48.720
 Yeah, he had--

00:45:48.720 --> 00:45:50.080
 Tell us about this woman.

00:45:50.080 --> 00:45:52.000
 Well, she just had really nice feet.

00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:57.680
 It was a stunt by the Caropedists of the USA to find the perfect foot,

00:45:57.680 --> 00:46:01.360
 and they eventually managed to find it on the end of a leg

00:46:01.360 --> 00:46:04.960
 of a woman called Miss Clara Smith Houston,

00:46:04.960 --> 00:46:07.040
 who coincidentally was also a Caropedist.

00:46:07.040 --> 00:46:07.680
 Yeah.

00:46:07.680 --> 00:46:08.800
 Anyway, so--

00:46:08.800 --> 00:46:09.440
 Suspects.

00:46:09.440 --> 00:46:10.800
 Feels a bit rigged to me, doesn't it?

00:46:10.800 --> 00:46:11.840
 It does feel a bit rigged.

00:46:11.840 --> 00:46:12.160
 I don't know.

00:46:12.160 --> 00:46:14.880
 You might get into an industry because your feet are so nice.

00:46:14.880 --> 00:46:16.720
 People have complimented you your whole life.

00:46:16.720 --> 00:46:18.000
 They thought, yeah.

00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:21.520
 Well, anyway, this story made it into some newspapers,

00:46:21.520 --> 00:46:23.360
 just as the Caropedists had hoped.

00:46:23.360 --> 00:46:27.360
 But the husband of Miss Smith Houston was not impressed,

00:46:27.360 --> 00:46:31.680
 and he sent her a telegram, like really divorced by text,

00:46:31.680 --> 00:46:34.960
 saying "friend, wife," not a great start.

00:46:34.960 --> 00:46:39.440
 "Congratulations on putting your best foot forward."

00:46:39.440 --> 00:46:40.400
 Nice pun.

00:46:40.400 --> 00:46:42.880
 "Nothing like notoriety, no matter how cheap."

00:46:42.880 --> 00:46:47.120
 "Send your picture to the Pink Journals and call on me for cash,

00:46:47.120 --> 00:46:52.320
 with which to advertise yourself further, full stop, your husband, full stop."

00:46:52.320 --> 00:46:56.160
 And then Clara was later quoted in another newspaper saying

00:46:56.160 --> 00:46:58.320
 that she decided if a man was so jealous,

00:46:58.320 --> 00:47:01.520
 he would not even allow me to boast of a perfect foot,

00:47:01.520 --> 00:47:03.840
 then I best give him up and all the luxuries

00:47:03.840 --> 00:47:05.680
 with which he provided me.

00:47:05.680 --> 00:47:08.320
 Except the one thing, happiness.

00:47:08.320 --> 00:47:11.760
 Here, here, here, here, Clara Houston.

00:47:11.760 --> 00:47:12.240
 I agree.

00:47:12.240 --> 00:47:12.800
 I get the luxuries.

00:47:12.800 --> 00:47:13.360
 Can I just--

00:47:13.360 --> 00:47:16.800
 So his message, when he's saying advertise yourself in a newspaper,

00:47:16.800 --> 00:47:18.880
 is he saying 'cause you're single now?

00:47:18.880 --> 00:47:20.080
 What's that second, what's that look?

00:47:20.080 --> 00:47:21.200
 I think he's saying just 'cause it's--

00:47:21.200 --> 00:47:22.560
 Oh, you're now a foot person, are you?

00:47:22.560 --> 00:47:24.560
 You know, you're now just sort of like trading on your feet.

00:47:24.560 --> 00:47:27.760
 I think he was also implying that she was living off his money.

00:47:27.760 --> 00:47:31.040
 And he was like, "Well, if you want more money,

00:47:31.040 --> 00:47:34.160
 just to advertise yourself to the world for your awesome feet,

00:47:34.160 --> 00:47:37.280
 then fine, full stop, your husband, full stop."

00:47:37.280 --> 00:47:39.680
 Those agro-full stops.

00:47:39.680 --> 00:47:41.680
 So the question here is, what is the perfect foot?

00:47:41.680 --> 00:47:42.960
 What did Clara have?

00:47:42.960 --> 00:47:44.000
 And she had--

00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:44.720
 Seven toes.

00:47:45.520 --> 00:47:46.480
 She had seven toes.

00:47:46.480 --> 00:47:47.760
 I guess having seven toes.

00:47:47.760 --> 00:47:52.400
 So she had nine inches.

00:47:52.400 --> 00:47:53.600
 They were nine inches long.

00:47:53.600 --> 00:47:55.360
 Do you know what size that is, though?

00:47:55.360 --> 00:47:56.800
 I just know.

00:47:56.800 --> 00:47:58.080
 I've just read it from this.

00:47:58.080 --> 00:47:59.440
 So you've just written down nine inches,

00:47:59.440 --> 00:48:01.120
 but you don't know how big or small that is,

00:48:01.120 --> 00:48:02.400
 presumably for a woman's foot.

00:48:02.400 --> 00:48:02.880
 'Cause I don't know--

00:48:02.880 --> 00:48:04.000
 At least Dan goes into the shoe shop

00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:07.520
 and he says, "I reject your size existence.

00:48:07.520 --> 00:48:09.840
 I'm going to give you an inches.

00:48:09.840 --> 00:48:10.480
 You can work it out."

00:48:10.480 --> 00:48:13.200
 256 barley corns, my good Dan.

00:48:13.520 --> 00:48:20.000
 I'd like a shoe that's about the size of a glass,

00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:21.920
 which I dragged from the other day.

00:48:21.920 --> 00:48:26.080
 I want a shoe that doesn't fit in James' con.

00:48:26.080 --> 00:48:33.680
 Well, for the listener, it's size 3.5, which is fairly small.

00:48:33.680 --> 00:48:34.640
 And what is the--

00:48:34.640 --> 00:48:37.760
 Why is it saying 10 inches around the instep?

00:48:37.760 --> 00:48:39.120
 The circumference, I suppose.

00:48:39.120 --> 00:48:39.520
 Yes.

00:48:39.520 --> 00:48:40.080
 OK.

00:48:40.080 --> 00:48:40.800
 Nice.

00:48:40.800 --> 00:48:42.800
 So very small feet, 3.5.

00:48:42.800 --> 00:48:44.960
 I mean, not freakishly small.

00:48:44.960 --> 00:48:46.160
 No, but that is small.

00:48:46.160 --> 00:48:50.160
 It's exactly 1/7th her height in accordance

00:48:50.160 --> 00:48:52.320
 with the Greek rule of sculpture.

00:48:52.320 --> 00:48:53.360
 Oh, that's interesting.

00:48:53.360 --> 00:48:53.840
 Yeah.

00:48:53.840 --> 00:48:54.560
 OK.

00:48:54.560 --> 00:48:57.120
 This is from the Day Book, where this was all published.

00:48:57.120 --> 00:48:59.280
 And it's an amazing blog, by the way, that you found, James.

00:48:59.280 --> 00:49:00.000
 Yes.

00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:00.880
 Second Glance History.

00:49:00.880 --> 00:49:02.160
 Yeah, it's absolutely brilliant.

00:49:02.160 --> 00:49:03.120
 And it was really nice,

00:49:03.120 --> 00:49:05.680
 'cause they had the cuttings of all the newspapers and stuff.

00:49:05.680 --> 00:49:06.160
 Yeah.

00:49:06.160 --> 00:49:07.920
 So I didn't have to go digging for them myself.

00:49:10.160 --> 00:49:14.400
 And then they found that there was a new perfect foot found in 1916,

00:49:14.400 --> 00:49:16.960
 which belonged to a nine-year-old girl called Mary Boca.

00:49:16.960 --> 00:49:20.080
 This was found in Chicago.

00:49:20.080 --> 00:49:23.840
 And Mary's mom said, "Mary had very pretty feet when she was a baby.

00:49:23.840 --> 00:49:26.320
 I felt nature's gift must not be marred.

00:49:26.320 --> 00:49:28.560
 I began massaging her feet with cold cream

00:49:28.560 --> 00:49:30.320
 to make them strong and smooth

00:49:30.320 --> 00:49:33.680
 and rubbed them carefully to preserve the natural outline."

00:49:33.680 --> 00:49:34.080
 Yeah.

00:49:34.080 --> 00:49:36.080
 And so her mom realized when she was really young

00:49:36.080 --> 00:49:37.440
 that she had really nice feet

00:49:37.440 --> 00:49:39.600
 and then put special stockings on her

00:49:39.600 --> 00:49:41.920
 so that she didn't damage the feet and all that kind of stuff.

00:49:41.920 --> 00:49:43.760
 It's like the William Sisters' dad, isn't it?

00:49:43.760 --> 00:49:47.280
 I bet they made a Hollywood film about her in the '30s.

00:49:47.280 --> 00:49:49.680
 I just don't get the whole feet thing.

00:49:49.680 --> 00:49:51.760
 I know lots of people really like feet.

00:49:51.760 --> 00:49:52.960
 20% of men, I believe.

00:49:52.960 --> 00:49:54.080
 Only 3% of them.

00:49:54.080 --> 00:49:55.040
 20% of straight men.

00:49:55.040 --> 00:49:55.840
 I think it was that.

00:49:55.840 --> 00:49:56.800
 Or maybe it was 10%.

00:49:56.800 --> 00:49:57.600
 What do you mean, really?

00:49:57.600 --> 00:49:58.320
 I feel like I...

00:49:58.320 --> 00:49:59.120
 Fetishize.

00:49:59.120 --> 00:49:59.600
 Right, okay.

00:49:59.600 --> 00:50:00.320
 Oh, really?

00:50:00.320 --> 00:50:02.960
 'Cause there's a website called wikifeet.

00:50:02.960 --> 00:50:03.520
 Oh, yeah.

00:50:03.520 --> 00:50:06.160
 It features a great number of feet.

00:50:06.160 --> 00:50:08.720
 Features greatly in your search history after this week.

00:50:08.720 --> 00:50:09.280
 It does now.

00:50:09.280 --> 00:50:12.480
 There are only three rules on wikifeet.

00:50:12.480 --> 00:50:14.240
 Only five toes.

00:50:14.240 --> 00:50:20.640
 The rules change constantly.

00:50:20.640 --> 00:50:22.800
 Updating their feet.

00:50:22.800 --> 00:50:25.760
 No, so you have to be...

00:50:25.760 --> 00:50:28.560
 It's normally people posting pictures of women's feet.

00:50:28.560 --> 00:50:31.440
 I don't think the men section on wikifeet is enormous.

00:50:31.440 --> 00:50:34.160
 It's sort of women over 17 who are listed on IMDb.

00:50:34.160 --> 00:50:35.680
 So you have to be in the public eye somehow.

00:50:36.480 --> 00:50:38.880
 No copyright breaches and no adult content.

00:50:38.880 --> 00:50:41.200
 But there are people who complain a lot.

00:50:41.200 --> 00:50:43.680
 They get in rouse with each other on wikifeet.

00:50:43.680 --> 00:50:46.160
 They'll post on a photo NFS.

00:50:46.160 --> 00:50:47.920
 Which means no feet showing.

00:50:47.920 --> 00:50:48.720
 Which is a point.

00:50:48.720 --> 00:50:49.680
 I know it is, yeah.

00:50:49.680 --> 00:50:50.560
 That is weird.

00:50:50.560 --> 00:50:52.080
 But I think if it's if someone's wearing...

00:50:52.080 --> 00:50:53.280
 Maybe if you've got a welly on.

00:50:53.280 --> 00:50:55.520
 This is pointless to me.

00:50:55.520 --> 00:50:57.760
 I think if you've got a welly on, you're on the right side.

00:50:57.760 --> 00:51:00.720
 My friend has a page.

00:51:00.720 --> 00:51:01.360
 It's a mutual friend.

00:51:01.360 --> 00:51:02.160
 I won't say her name, though,

00:51:02.160 --> 00:51:03.520
 'cause it is a bit of a weird site.

00:51:03.520 --> 00:51:05.360
 But she has a page on there.

00:51:05.360 --> 00:51:07.120
 And it has ratings.

00:51:07.120 --> 00:51:08.800
 So she has three out of five.

00:51:08.800 --> 00:51:09.280
 Three.

00:51:09.280 --> 00:51:10.800
 Yeah, which is okay.

00:51:10.800 --> 00:51:11.680
 She's got okay feet.

00:51:11.680 --> 00:51:12.880
 You wouldn't get in the Uber, would you?

00:51:12.880 --> 00:51:13.840
 If I had a three out of five.

00:51:13.840 --> 00:51:16.880
 I think it's a bit...

00:51:16.880 --> 00:51:18.480
 I mean, obviously it's pretty odd stuff.

00:51:18.480 --> 00:51:20.320
 And I think you can, if you say,

00:51:20.320 --> 00:51:22.560
 take my pictures off this website, they do.

00:51:22.560 --> 00:51:23.280
 Yeah, okay.

00:51:23.280 --> 00:51:24.720
 Yeah, they seem quite nice.

00:51:24.720 --> 00:51:26.160
 There was a journalist who writes for the...

00:51:26.160 --> 00:51:27.920
 Well, I read an article in the cut anyway.

00:51:27.920 --> 00:51:29.520
 So she writes for the cut and all the other things.

00:51:29.520 --> 00:51:31.760
 And she was going out with someone who said,

00:51:31.760 --> 00:51:33.360
 "Hey, do you know you're on wikifeet?"

00:51:33.360 --> 00:51:35.120
 And she said, "No, I don't."

00:51:35.440 --> 00:51:38.240
 And so saw that she had indeed been uploaded.

00:51:38.240 --> 00:51:39.280
 Her feet had been uploaded

00:51:39.280 --> 00:51:41.600
 'cause they get it off like public Instagram pages,

00:51:41.600 --> 00:51:42.160
 for instance.

00:51:42.160 --> 00:51:44.480
 So they were pictures of her on the beach on Instagram

00:51:44.480 --> 00:51:45.840
 and someone's taken her feet.

00:51:45.840 --> 00:51:48.720
 And she said, "Okay, I'll get in touch."

00:51:48.720 --> 00:51:50.480
 So she got in touch with the person.

00:51:50.480 --> 00:51:53.440
 And so she interviewed this guy who posted her feet.

00:51:53.440 --> 00:51:55.920
 And she was very fair, I have to say.

00:51:55.920 --> 00:51:57.680
 And I thought he did seem a bit odd.

00:51:57.680 --> 00:52:00.800
 And she did say at one point,

00:52:00.800 --> 00:52:02.800
 "I've noticed that sometimes within 10 minutes

00:52:02.800 --> 00:52:04.880
 "of me posting an Instagram story that shows my feet,

00:52:04.880 --> 00:52:06.720
 "the screenshot is up on wikifeet.

00:52:06.720 --> 00:52:08.320
 "How does that happen?"

00:52:08.320 --> 00:52:10.240
 And he said, "Look, I don't just sit there looking for it.

00:52:10.240 --> 00:52:12.640
 "If I happen to see it and I like it, I'll put it on there.

00:52:12.640 --> 00:52:14.880
 "But I'm not sitting there all day and staring."

00:52:14.880 --> 00:52:17.760
 It's like, it sort of started off quite nice.

00:52:17.760 --> 00:52:19.200
 And then he obviously, you know,

00:52:19.200 --> 00:52:21.280
 he kept on saying what beautiful feet she had.

00:52:21.280 --> 00:52:24.800
 - I read an article that said that the incidence

00:52:24.800 --> 00:52:28.560
 of fetishism increases as a response to epidemics

00:52:28.560 --> 00:52:30.960
 of sexually transmitted diseases in history.

00:52:30.960 --> 00:52:32.560
 - Interesting.

00:52:32.560 --> 00:52:36.080
 This was a guy called Dr. James Giannini

00:52:36.080 --> 00:52:38.320
 and his colleagues who did the study.

00:52:38.320 --> 00:52:41.360
 And they look back as far back as the 12th century.

00:52:41.360 --> 00:52:44.320
 And they found that when there was a spike in STIs,

00:52:44.320 --> 00:52:45.840
 people preferred feet.

00:52:45.840 --> 00:52:48.320
 And it might have been that they were just less interested

00:52:48.320 --> 00:52:50.560
 in penetrative sex because they might get diseases.

00:52:50.560 --> 00:52:53.200
 - So your feet are a bit safer to fancy?

00:52:53.200 --> 00:52:54.320
 - I guess so.

00:52:54.320 --> 00:52:55.140
 - Yeah.

00:52:55.140 --> 00:52:57.120
 - Because what's the worst you can get?

00:52:57.120 --> 00:52:58.480
 Athlete's cock on your cock.

00:52:58.480 --> 00:52:59.600
 (laughing)

00:52:59.600 --> 00:53:00.720
 - Athlete's cock.

00:53:00.720 --> 00:53:01.560
 - Yeah.

00:53:01.560 --> 00:53:03.360
 - And then they went all the way up to the 80s

00:53:03.360 --> 00:53:05.040
 and they found even in the AIDS epidemic

00:53:05.040 --> 00:53:08.840
 that when that happened, then the numbers of foot oriented

00:53:08.840 --> 00:53:11.240
 and foot fetish pictures in kind of porn magazines

00:53:11.240 --> 00:53:12.600
 and stuff shot up there.

00:53:12.600 --> 00:53:14.520
 Because yeah, so preservation, I guess.

00:53:14.520 --> 00:53:16.400
 People are thinking, well, where else can I go?

00:53:16.400 --> 00:53:18.840
 - Can I tell you about Hogan Fukunaga?

00:53:18.840 --> 00:53:19.680
 - Yeah.

00:53:19.680 --> 00:53:21.120
 - He was arrested in the year 2000.

00:53:21.120 --> 00:53:22.120
 - Oh no.

00:53:22.120 --> 00:53:22.960
 - I know.

00:53:22.960 --> 00:53:24.560
 Along with 11 acolytes.

00:53:24.560 --> 00:53:26.120
 That's a bad start, isn't it?

00:53:26.120 --> 00:53:26.960
 (laughing)

00:53:26.960 --> 00:53:28.800
 When you and your acolytes have been picked up.

00:53:28.800 --> 00:53:30.400
 (laughing)

00:53:30.400 --> 00:53:33.600
 - So he was the head of a cult in Japan

00:53:33.600 --> 00:53:36.360
 which offered followers analysis of their spiritual

00:53:36.360 --> 00:53:39.080
 and mental health entirely based on their toes.

00:53:39.080 --> 00:53:39.920
 - Right.

00:53:39.920 --> 00:53:43.760
 - So followers would pay 600 quid to have their feet stroked

00:53:43.760 --> 00:53:46.760
 and then looked at by Mr. Fukunaga.

00:53:46.760 --> 00:53:48.080
 - Consenting adults.

00:53:48.080 --> 00:53:53.080
 - Consenting adults with more money than sense.

00:53:53.080 --> 00:53:56.220
 And no, consenting adults with maybe too much money

00:53:56.220 --> 00:53:58.360
 on their hands and who fell for the story

00:53:58.360 --> 00:54:01.000
 that, oh, I can predict your future through your toes.

00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:03.680
 - It's like a pedicure cum fortune teller, right?

00:54:03.680 --> 00:54:06.480
 - Yeah, it's like cross my foot with silver.

00:54:06.480 --> 00:54:07.880
 (laughing)

00:54:07.880 --> 00:54:10.680
 The predictions were all very suffering based.

00:54:10.680 --> 00:54:12.760
 They predicted, oh, you'll die of a horrible disease

00:54:12.760 --> 00:54:13.760
 or you'll fall into debt.

00:54:13.760 --> 00:54:15.800
 So that wasn't nice.

00:54:15.800 --> 00:54:17.480
 But you can avert your problems if you sign up

00:54:17.480 --> 00:54:18.480
 for one of our lecture courses

00:54:18.480 --> 00:54:20.800
 or if you buy a pinch of Buddha's ashes

00:54:20.800 --> 00:54:23.200
 at a mere 120,000 pounds.

00:54:23.200 --> 00:54:24.040
 - Okay.

00:54:24.040 --> 00:54:25.760
 - They were running this cult for about 15 years.

00:54:25.760 --> 00:54:28.000
 They made 500 million quid out of it.

00:54:28.000 --> 00:54:28.840
 - Wow.

00:54:28.840 --> 00:54:29.680
 - Yeah.

00:54:29.680 --> 00:54:31.000
 And then he claimed later on

00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:32.720
 that he had been simply obeying the voice of heaven

00:54:32.720 --> 00:54:35.240
 but that he had since forgotten what the voice had said.

00:54:35.240 --> 00:54:36.160
 (laughing)

00:54:36.160 --> 00:54:37.680
 - RIP a lot of people off, maybe.

00:54:37.680 --> 00:54:38.760
 - I think so.

00:54:38.760 --> 00:54:40.000
 - It feels like in this cult being called

00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:41.840
 the head of the operation is the wrong title.

00:54:41.840 --> 00:54:43.160
 (laughing)

00:54:43.160 --> 00:54:44.600
 That should be the junior role.

00:54:44.600 --> 00:54:46.640
 - Yeah, you're absolutely right.

00:54:46.640 --> 00:54:47.960
 - Yeah, he was the big toe.

00:54:47.960 --> 00:54:50.280
 When you have an enormous interest in feet,

00:54:50.280 --> 00:54:52.120
 I believe it's called podophilia,

00:54:52.120 --> 00:54:55.400
 which means there is a word that should be coined

00:54:55.400 --> 00:54:57.800
 for people who have an abnormal interest in podcasts.

00:54:57.800 --> 00:55:00.880
 So when I have Harkin's podcast,

00:55:00.880 --> 00:55:03.320
 you might have Andy's podophile cast.

00:55:03.320 --> 00:55:04.660
 - No, I'm saying that-

00:55:04.660 --> 00:55:06.960
 - Would all your acolytes be called podophiles?

00:55:06.960 --> 00:55:09.400
 (laughing)

00:55:09.400 --> 00:55:10.840
 You can get badges made.

00:55:10.840 --> 00:55:12.480
 (laughing)

00:55:12.480 --> 00:55:16.040
 - I'm a podophile, I shouted the mob out like my house.

00:55:16.040 --> 00:55:18.280
 (laughing)

00:55:18.280 --> 00:55:22.400
 - No, but there should be a word for people

00:55:22.400 --> 00:55:23.800
 who like podcast lots

00:55:23.800 --> 00:55:25.360
 because podophile is taken by the feet people, right?

00:55:25.360 --> 00:55:26.480
 - Let's call them feetophiles.

00:55:26.480 --> 00:55:27.320
 - Yes.

00:55:27.320 --> 00:55:29.760
 - We'll take their word back.

00:55:29.760 --> 00:55:31.240
 - But you know, there should be something.

00:55:31.240 --> 00:55:32.160
 - Audio file.

00:55:32.160 --> 00:55:33.360
 - Audio file, that's good,

00:55:33.360 --> 00:55:36.640
 but it's quite confusing 'cause it's also an audio file.

00:55:36.640 --> 00:55:37.480
 - Yeah.

00:55:37.480 --> 00:55:39.680
 - Oh, that's what makes it so perfect.

00:55:39.680 --> 00:55:42.760
 Sorry, it's actually better than a confusing, yeah, yeah.

00:55:42.760 --> 00:55:43.920
 - Yeah.

00:55:43.920 --> 00:55:48.920
 - So famous names who love a foot include Elvis.

00:55:48.920 --> 00:55:50.600
 - Are we really doing this?

00:55:50.600 --> 00:55:51.440
 - We're really doing.

00:55:51.440 --> 00:55:52.800
 - There's a lot of people who have admitted

00:55:52.800 --> 00:55:55.080
 to loving feet and having been a feet.

00:55:55.080 --> 00:55:57.440
 - It's quite, it's just quite a turn for us, isn't it?

00:55:57.440 --> 00:55:58.960
 Like celebrity toe suckers.

00:55:58.960 --> 00:55:59.800
 - Yeah.

00:55:59.800 --> 00:56:02.440
 - Apparently the podcast is now about.

00:56:02.440 --> 00:56:04.760
 - It was a story, but apparently Elvis really loved it.

00:56:04.760 --> 00:56:06.680
 What's interesting is there is obviously

00:56:06.680 --> 00:56:08.720
 quite a lot of famous stories about, you know,

00:56:08.720 --> 00:56:10.880
 his henchmen would go out into a crown after a gig.

00:56:10.880 --> 00:56:13.280
 - Good henchmen and cut off people's feet.

00:56:13.280 --> 00:56:14.840
 (laughing)

00:56:14.840 --> 00:56:16.600
 - And they would bring them back to the volcano

00:56:16.600 --> 00:56:18.440
 where the Elvis had his Graceland.

00:56:18.440 --> 00:56:20.360
 - His foot soldiers, yeah, they would go out.

00:56:20.360 --> 00:56:22.960
 - And they would, so they would, you know, go,

00:56:22.960 --> 00:56:24.520
 you, you, do you want to come meet Elvis?

00:56:24.520 --> 00:56:25.840
 And obviously it was, you know,

00:56:25.840 --> 00:56:27.120
 to bring women backstage.

00:56:27.120 --> 00:56:29.240
 And apparently they screened their feet.

00:56:29.240 --> 00:56:30.480
 Is, is what is up with that?

00:56:30.480 --> 00:56:33.040
 - Were they crawling around on the floor in the gig?

00:56:33.040 --> 00:56:34.160
 Just looking for feet.

00:56:34.160 --> 00:56:36.000
 (laughing)

00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:37.840
 - I dropped an earring.

00:56:37.840 --> 00:56:39.920
 Presumably most women went to the gigs wearing shoes.

00:56:39.920 --> 00:56:41.400
 How are they doing that?

00:56:41.400 --> 00:56:43.960
 - Don't, I, I, you know, it's just a rumor.

00:56:43.960 --> 00:56:45.840
 - What, it's just a rumor?

00:56:45.840 --> 00:56:48.200
 - We know that he loved feet and the, the story is,

00:56:48.200 --> 00:56:49.900
 is that that was part of what it, you know,

00:56:49.900 --> 00:56:52.080
 the screening is what would go on and I'm lucky.

00:56:52.080 --> 00:56:52.920
 - Story is.

00:56:52.920 --> 00:56:56.200
 - Can I, can I steer us back towards karma waters?

00:56:56.200 --> 00:56:57.200
 - Sure.

00:56:57.200 --> 00:56:58.520
 - I think about corns.

00:56:58.520 --> 00:57:01.000
 You know, you get corns on your feet.

00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:01.840
 - Yeah.

00:57:01.840 --> 00:57:02.680
 - Oh, okay, yeah, yeah.

00:57:02.680 --> 00:57:04.860
 - Can, can you, can they transfer to your pain?

00:57:04.860 --> 00:57:06.960
 (laughing)

00:57:06.960 --> 00:57:08.880
 I don't believe so.

00:57:08.880 --> 00:57:09.880
 - Cock corn.

00:57:09.880 --> 00:57:12.160
 - But they used to, it used to have street corn cutters,

00:57:12.160 --> 00:57:13.000
 right?

00:57:13.000 --> 00:57:13.840
 That was the thing.

00:57:13.840 --> 00:57:14.680
 - Oh God, really?

00:57:14.680 --> 00:57:15.520
 - Yeah.

00:57:15.520 --> 00:57:17.240
 I mean, it was, you know, it's sort of pretty,

00:57:17.240 --> 00:57:18.960
 and it's, it's obviously, if you have corns,

00:57:18.960 --> 00:57:19.920
 they're really painful.

00:57:19.920 --> 00:57:20.760
 - What would you do?

00:57:20.760 --> 00:57:22.180
 - Like filing a nail, like that kind of material.

00:57:22.180 --> 00:57:23.840
 - All sorts of procedures, basically.

00:57:23.840 --> 00:57:25.880
 - But the weird thing is, I just like this,

00:57:25.880 --> 00:57:27.640
 I was on the blog Foot Talk,

00:57:27.640 --> 00:57:30.320
 which is another great foot based blog.

00:57:30.320 --> 00:57:31.160
 - Oh yeah.

00:57:31.160 --> 00:57:32.320
 - I really recommend it.

00:57:32.320 --> 00:57:33.480
 But there used to be jingles.

00:57:33.480 --> 00:57:35.160
 They would advertise themselves by singing jingles

00:57:35.160 --> 00:57:36.000
 in the streets.

00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:37.800
 And the weird thing about this is that sometimes

00:57:37.800 --> 00:57:42.600
 celebrity composers would write jingles for corn cutters.

00:57:42.600 --> 00:57:43.440
 - Really?

00:57:43.440 --> 00:57:44.280
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:57:44.280 --> 00:57:45.120
 - Like how celebrity are we talking?

00:57:45.120 --> 00:57:46.520
 Mozart's, God is.

00:57:46.520 --> 00:57:47.360
 - Well.

00:57:47.360 --> 00:57:48.200
 - Irving Berlin.

00:57:48.200 --> 00:57:49.960
 - I'm gonna say the name Orlando Gibbons.

00:57:49.960 --> 00:57:50.800
 - Oh yeah?

00:57:50.800 --> 00:57:51.880
 - Oh my God.

00:57:51.880 --> 00:57:52.720
 - Yeah.

00:57:52.720 --> 00:57:53.720
 - Not Orlando.

00:57:53.720 --> 00:57:55.960
 - Wait, I mean, so he.

00:57:55.960 --> 00:57:57.040
 - Wow.

00:57:57.040 --> 00:57:58.160
 - He was famous at the time.

00:57:58.160 --> 00:58:00.440
 He, you know, he was the organist at Westminster Abbey.

00:58:00.440 --> 00:58:02.800
 He was eventually named Virginalist to the King.

00:58:02.800 --> 00:58:05.440
 (all laughing)

00:58:05.440 --> 00:58:08.600
 - That was a storm, he was kind of like that, wasn't it?

00:58:08.600 --> 00:58:11.320
 - A virtual being, a kind of piano, obviously.

00:58:11.320 --> 00:58:14.960
 - Do we have the song then?

00:58:14.960 --> 00:58:15.800
 The jingle one?

00:58:15.800 --> 00:58:17.280
 - Sadly, I don't think we do.

00:58:17.280 --> 00:58:19.080
 They're pretty sure that he came up with jingles

00:58:19.080 --> 00:58:21.320
 for corn cutters as well, as a kind of sideline.

00:58:21.320 --> 00:58:23.520
 I don't know if it was lucrative or something to do.

00:58:23.520 --> 00:58:24.920
 - You guys are just reminding me.

00:58:24.920 --> 00:58:28.720
 Wilf, my son, he used to love corn on the cob,

00:58:28.720 --> 00:58:30.800
 but he always used to call it corn on the cock.

00:58:30.800 --> 00:58:32.840
 That was the phrase that he used.

00:58:32.840 --> 00:58:34.640
 - Can I tell you something about horses feet?

00:58:34.640 --> 00:58:35.480
 - Yeah.

00:58:35.480 --> 00:58:36.320
 - Which I love.

00:58:36.320 --> 00:58:40.280
 Is that horses feet are always giving you a middle finger.

00:58:40.280 --> 00:58:41.520
 One big middle finger.

00:58:41.520 --> 00:58:44.880
 Every horse's hoof is what we call a horse's foot.

00:58:44.880 --> 00:58:46.400
 It's just a big middle finger.

00:58:46.400 --> 00:58:50.600
 And this is because they once had five toes on their feet.

00:58:50.600 --> 00:58:52.400
 Many, many, many years ago.

00:58:52.400 --> 00:58:54.120
 There are actually kind of three of them still visible

00:58:54.120 --> 00:58:55.600
 'cause you've got two little vestigial ones.

00:58:55.600 --> 00:58:56.680
 If you know, horse's legs,

00:58:56.680 --> 00:58:58.640
 they're kind of a bit out of the leg.

00:58:58.640 --> 00:59:01.040
 But the hoof is just the middle finger.

00:59:01.040 --> 00:59:04.840
 And there's actually a biologist called Catherine Cavana

00:59:04.840 --> 00:59:07.960
 who recently was sorting through preserved horse embryos

00:59:07.960 --> 00:59:09.440
 for reasons she didn't go into.

00:59:09.440 --> 00:59:12.920
 And she saw that in the very, very early days

00:59:12.920 --> 00:59:15.800
 of horse gestation, they have five fingers

00:59:15.800 --> 00:59:16.640
 on each foot.

00:59:16.640 --> 00:59:17.460
 - Wow.

00:59:17.460 --> 00:59:19.200
 - And then you see it in the cells

00:59:19.200 --> 00:59:20.480
 and it's like they're about to grow

00:59:20.480 --> 00:59:21.640
 and then they decide not to grow

00:59:21.640 --> 00:59:22.960
 because they've evolved out of it.

00:59:22.960 --> 00:59:24.040
 - So let me ask you this.

00:59:24.040 --> 00:59:27.360
 If a horse with five toes rocks up to the Grand National,

00:59:27.360 --> 00:59:28.480
 are there regulations to say?

00:59:28.480 --> 00:59:29.600
 - No rules against it.

00:59:29.600 --> 00:59:30.440
 No rules against it.

00:59:30.440 --> 00:59:31.280
 - No rules, no rules.

00:59:31.280 --> 00:59:32.600
 And it's five times faster.

00:59:32.600 --> 00:59:34.080
 - Yeah, ridden by a crocodile.

00:59:34.080 --> 00:59:36.320
 (laughing)

00:59:36.320 --> 00:59:39.600
 You know that the women of Chicago

00:59:39.600 --> 00:59:41.120
 have been famous throughout America

00:59:41.120 --> 00:59:43.480
 for abnormally sized feet.

00:59:43.480 --> 00:59:44.400
 - Big or small?

00:59:44.400 --> 00:59:45.240
 - Big.

00:59:45.240 --> 00:59:46.080
 - Okay.

00:59:46.080 --> 00:59:47.280
 - In the early 20th century.

00:59:47.280 --> 00:59:50.880
 So this perfect foot, the second one was in Chicago.

00:59:50.880 --> 00:59:51.800
 And everyone was surprised

00:59:51.800 --> 00:59:54.280
 because people in Chicago usually have massive feet.

00:59:54.280 --> 00:59:55.520
 - What a funny key shape to have about it.

00:59:55.520 --> 00:59:56.360
 - It's amazing.

00:59:56.360 --> 00:59:57.760
 And I looked in the newspaper archives

00:59:57.760 --> 01:00:00.400
 and sure enough, if you look like before, you know,

01:00:00.400 --> 01:00:02.960
 the 20s and so it's for big feet Chicago,

01:00:02.960 --> 01:00:04.200
 there's all these articles are going,

01:00:04.200 --> 01:00:05.800
 "Yeah, they all got big feet."

01:00:05.800 --> 01:00:07.480
 And then you get people in Chicago saying,

01:00:07.480 --> 01:00:08.640
 "Yeah, we do have big feet,

01:00:08.640 --> 01:00:11.080
 but actually that also means we have big intellect."

01:00:11.080 --> 01:00:11.920
 - Wow.

01:00:11.920 --> 01:00:12.760
 - Yeah, sure it does.

01:00:12.760 --> 01:00:14.640
 - Is it just the women or is it the people in Chicago?

01:00:14.640 --> 01:00:15.920
 - It's the women of Chicago.

01:00:15.920 --> 01:00:17.920
 - Is it so that they can like walk out

01:00:17.920 --> 01:00:19.880
 over the Great Lakes and distribute their weight better?

01:00:19.880 --> 01:00:21.520
 - Oh, that would be good, yeah.

01:00:21.520 --> 01:00:23.320
 - I thought maybe 'cause it's the windy city, isn't it?

01:00:23.320 --> 01:00:25.080
 And it would help you not to get blown over.

01:00:25.080 --> 01:00:25.920
 - Great shouts.

01:00:25.920 --> 01:00:26.760
 - Yeah.

01:00:26.760 --> 01:00:28.080
 - Yeah, it's got all these uses.

01:00:28.080 --> 01:00:29.240
 - That's evolution.

01:00:29.240 --> 01:00:30.160
 - That is such funny.

01:00:30.160 --> 01:00:31.240
 Is there any evidence behind it?

01:00:31.240 --> 01:00:32.080
 As it is, is it true?

01:00:32.080 --> 01:00:33.200
 - No, I can't be true.

01:00:33.200 --> 01:00:35.600
 I mean, I'll be honest, I haven't gone to Chicago

01:00:35.600 --> 01:00:37.600
 and measured all the women's feet.

01:00:37.600 --> 01:00:38.440
 But it can't be true.

01:00:38.440 --> 01:00:39.440
 - Get Elvis's henchmen to go and do it.

01:00:39.440 --> 01:00:41.700
 (laughing)

01:00:41.700 --> 01:00:44.280
 (upbeat music)

01:00:44.280 --> 01:00:46.860
 (upbeat music)

01:00:46.860 --> 01:00:49.000
 - Okay, that's it.

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:50.080
 That is all of our facts.

01:00:50.080 --> 01:00:51.560
