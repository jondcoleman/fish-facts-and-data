00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.360
 Hello and welcome to another episode of no such thing as a fish, a weekly podcast coming

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:24.480
 to you from the QI offices in Covent Garden.

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.960
 My name is Dan Shriver, I'm sitting here with Andrew Huntamari.

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:34.120
 Anna Chazizki and James Harkin, and once again we have gathered around the microphones

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:39.200
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days and in a particular order, here we

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.480
 go, starting with you, Andy.

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:42.480
 Thank you.

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:49.000
 Well that incredibly forgetful introduction.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.200
 My fact this week is that chicken's eggs turn from pointy end first to the blunt end

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:55.960
 first just before they come out.

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:57.280
 Like a baby?

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:58.280
 Like a baby.

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:03.200
 I don't know if babies have a pointy end, but when a baby is getting ready, yeah I guess

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:04.920
 the head is the head.

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.320
 So when you're getting ready to be born, babies will go into dive position.

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:09.320
 Well most babies do.

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:10.320
 Most babies.

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.600
 I was a breach as was my brother.

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.900
 So I wonder if chickens have the same thing, where sometimes you get a breach one where

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:17.900
 it's...

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:18.900
 Or quid eggs.

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:19.900
 Or quid eggs, yeah.

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:21.480
 And sometimes they have to Susereen it out because it's the pointy end first and it's

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:23.160
 just too difficult.

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:26.200
 Yeah, which seems counterinduitive, doesn't it?

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:31.800
 So why do they come out that end first, once you get past the most rounded bit, it probably

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:32.800
 just fires out.

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:33.800
 Yeah.

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:34.800
 It's exactly like a baby.

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:37.840
 That's why it's harder with a baby when they come out next to us because you have to push

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:39.720
 hardest right at the end, don't you?

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.840
 Babies should come out like, you know, like in the pencil position, like a pencil dive.

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:49.240
 Or like a diver the other way around, with the hands in a diving position.

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:50.240
 That'd be good.

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:55.600
 That's how I imagined Tom Daly was born.

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:56.600
 My water's broken.

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:59.960
 And there's lots of them.

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:02.000
 Judges hold of the date.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.480
 I was talking about Tom Daly the other day.

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:08.120
 I have a theory that it might not even be a theory, it might be a fact.

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:13.160
 But if you were a diver and you dive off high boards, half of your training must be just

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:14.160
 walking upstairs.

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.160
 Now it's not a fact.

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.360
 No, I think that was a fact.

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:19.360
 What do you mean by training?

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:23.960
 Well, because if you're not used to walking upstairs, like Anna and I walked up some stairs

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:29.160
 the other day and I almost died, you lose your energy and he's got to now do a dive once

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:30.160
 he's at the top of them.

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:31.160
 Those boards are really high.

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:32.160
 That's really steep stairs.

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:36.000
 But they are elite sports people, not like you walking up the stairs that cover garden.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.720
 But they must, they must part of their training must be like climb up some stairs.

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:40.720
 It must be.

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:41.720
 No.

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:44.640
 No possible reason why you wouldn't train them to climb stairs all the time.

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:49.280
 Actually, then elite divers have chair lifts so they can conserve their energy.

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:50.280
 There we go.

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:55.040
 Done, do you understand that if you get fit at one thing, sometimes that means you're fit

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:56.600
 at loads of other things.

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:00.960
 So if I become like a champion runner, I'll also probably find it easy to go upstairs.

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:01.960
 I don't disagree with that.

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:02.960
 I don't disagree with that.

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:03.960
 I don't think that's true.

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:04.960
 I think it uses different muscles.

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:05.960
 Yeah.

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:06.960
 But if you've seen these divers, they're like super fit.

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:07.960
 I'm not saying--

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:08.960
 They're not like flabby ass.

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:12.560
 People try to get up the stairs, are they?

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:16.400
 I'm annoyed that I've been bounced into the position now, supposedly saying that divers

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:17.400
 are not fit.

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:21.640
 You know, because all those competitions where they take a rest off way out, don't they?

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:22.640
 They have a sit down.

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:28.760
 Now, if the whole point of diving was to make the biggest splash possible, then you would

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:30.920
 have a lot of out-of-shape people climbing up.

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:31.920
 Yeah.

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:32.920
 And then that would be a problem.

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:33.920
 Yes.

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:34.920
 But did you mean--

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:35.920
 Because they might not make it to the dive.

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:36.920
 Well, that would be part of the--

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:37.920
 That's part of the competition.

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:38.920
 Yeah.

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:41.720
 So you have to be big enough to make a massive splash, but not big enough that you can't

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:43.720
 get to the top floor.

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:45.720
 And that's the two tensions.

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:46.720
 Yeah.

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:47.720
 I'm starting to think.

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:48.720
 You're right.

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:49.720
 Yeah.

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:50.720
 So hang on.

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:53.440
 You're saying that do you mean half a time that divers benched?

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:57.560
 I'm just saying I didn't factor in that that's half the gig getting up to the board.

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:02.360
 But then I think if you, once it's been a leaked diver, and you spent half of your training

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:07.000
 time climbing up and downstairs, and only half of your training time learning how to

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
 actually dive, probably--

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.000
 But they must--

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.000
 No, it's right.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.000
 They must do.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.000
 How long does it take to get up those stairs?

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.000
 30 seconds.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.600
 But how long do you spend fapping around getting ready for the dive?

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:18.600
 Probably about 30 seconds.

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:20.720
 They're probably catching their breath again.

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:25.080
 They're not all-- that's not where all training happens, of course, with divers.

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:27.160
 They do a lot in maths and stuff like that.

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:28.760
 It's a lot of gymnastics and stuff like that.

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:29.760
 Yeah, I didn't know that.

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:30.760
 I see.

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:32.760
 You're just saying they spend half their time because to practice--

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:33.760
 Yeah.

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:34.760
 --you do have to go up the stairs.

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:36.760
 We're just down saying they actually need to practice going up the stairs.

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:40.760
 If you got there and you don't even have time to complete the first half of your modules,

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:51.240
 you just got to the top of the stairs.

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:53.480
 Something about the man who discovered this.

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:57.920
 The man who discovered-- I'm just a reminder of the fact that chicken's eggs turn from pointy

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:00.200
 end first to blunt end first just before they hatch.

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:04.880
 He was an egg scientist, he studied birds and bird's eggs.

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:10.400
 And he was called Heinrich Wickman, or Wickman, and he found out by marking the eggs with

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:15.760
 a pencil, up the birds, just an hour before they laid the eggs.

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:19.240
 So he inserted a pencil into the bird's cloaca.

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:20.240
 Wow.

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:21.240
 I know.

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:25.520
 Anyway, I got this in a book called The Most Perfect Thing as a book all about birds eggs by

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:26.520
 guy called Tim Burkehead.

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:27.520
 And I do recommend it.

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:28.800
 It's a really interesting book.

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:34.160
 An egg shape is-- that specific shape is the most pleasing shape that it could be to

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:35.160
 us.

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:38.600
 So they've done some brain tests that look at the kind of surface curvature that humans

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:40.040
 find most pleasing.

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:42.360
 And across all societies, it's that exact curvature.

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:43.360
 Wow.

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:46.800
 So if it goes more pointy or more squash, then we don't enjoy looking at it as much.

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:52.080
 And I think it's because we've evolved to think that that's what a healthy bit of tissue

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:53.400
 development would look like.

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:57.040
 But what's interesting is that different eggs are different sizes for different birds,

00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:58.040
 aren't they?

00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:59.440
 So is this a chicken egg you're talking about?

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:00.440
 Chicken egg, yeah.

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:01.440
 Interesting.

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:04.040
 But they're often quite-- you do get more rounded eggs, but you don't get, like, really

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:05.040
 long thing.

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:11.320
 It's way off, then, because then the bird that was born in them, like maybe a snake's egg would

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:12.320
 be like that.

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:13.320
 A stick bird.

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:14.320
 A stick bird.

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:16.440
 A stick flamingo egg would be like that.

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:17.440
 Yeah.

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:19.280
 But you do get round ones.

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:20.280
 You do get round ones.

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:21.280
 Yeah.

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:22.280
 Who do round ones?

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:23.280
 Some other ones.

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:24.280
 Some other birds, too.

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:25.280
 Yeah.

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:26.280
 There was a theory.

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:30.280
 I don't think this might not be true anymore, but the idea that the egg shape ones don't really

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:32.160
 roll out of nest very well.

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:37.320
 The ones which are more rounded are ones that lay eggs on the floor, so they might not fall

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:38.320
 out of trees as likely.

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:39.320
 Yeah.

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:40.520
 Are you going to debunk that theory?

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:43.440
 I've read a debunk, but I can't-- I didn't look into it properly.

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:45.360
 There is something in this book about it as well, actually.

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:46.720
 I can't remember chapter and verse.

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:47.720
 Yeah.

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:51.760
 They could have done, in order to find it out with modern technology, a sort of X-ray

00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:52.760
 video.

00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:57.440
 Because do you remember those that incredible photo of what a kiwi bird looks like just

00:06:57.440 --> 00:06:58.440
 before it gives birth?

00:06:58.440 --> 00:06:59.440
 Yeah.

00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:00.440
 I used to have that picture on my wall.

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:04.000
 It's so-- I don't think we just love the curvature so much.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:09.560
 Well, it's just because you're looking at it going, is this a kiwi with an egg in it, or

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:12.280
 is this an egg with a kiwi over it?

00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:13.280
 It's both.

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:14.280
 It's really.

00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:15.280
 It's both.

00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:16.280
 They're both the same size.

00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:17.280
 Are you inside your clothes?

00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:19.280
 Are they outside of you?

00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:21.280
 I think this James is both.

00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:22.280
 Is it?

00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:23.280
 Yeah.

00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:24.280
 Why am I mind that?

00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:27.760
 The equivalent-- if a kiwi bird, when you see this picture, and I highly recommend Google

00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:28.760
 this picture--

00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:30.320
 Yeah, I'll put it on my Twitter.

00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:32.040
 I'll put on a kiwi podcast as well.

00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:34.840
 It's equivalent to a human giving birth to a four-year-old.

00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:35.840
 Oh.

00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:36.840
 Oh.

00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:37.840
 That's how big the egg is.

00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:39.840
 And they're all wearing jumpers and things.

00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:43.440
 That would be especially scratchy and difficult.

00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:44.440
 Leggo.

00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:45.440
 Leggo.

00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:47.440
 Jumping into your whole way out.

00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:52.720
 Did you know that mammals evolved milk in order to wet their eggs?

00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:53.720
 What?

00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:54.720
 I don't even understand that.

00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:55.720
 Yeah.

00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:56.720
 I know.

00:07:56.720 --> 00:07:57.720
 Like cooked chicken eggs?

00:07:57.720 --> 00:07:58.920
 For it.

00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:02.160
 Not-- we didn't-- we didn't evolve milk

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:03.680
 so we could poach a good egg in here.

00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:05.680
 [LAUGHTER]

00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:06.680
 What's the egg?

00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:07.680
 What eggs?

00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:13.760
 So millions of years ago, when our ancestors were still laying eggs, they didn't have shells.

00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:16.400
 So they had, like, quite a porous membrane.

00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:19.120
 And that meant that they would dry out really easily.

00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:24.440
 And so we evolved milk, people think, now, in order to, like, put it over the eggs.

00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:25.440
 What?

00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:28.120
 Make sure that they didn't get dehydrated.

00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:33.400
 And then we realized-- evolution realized-- that quite a good use of this milk would be as

00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:38.080
 a way of transferring some nutrients into the offspring in our egg.

00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:41.440
 And so we developed more and more nutrients in our milk, and then kept putting that in the

00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:42.440
 egg.

00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:46.480
 And then eventually, that our milk became so nutrient-filled that it became just something

00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:48.760
 we could nurture a baby with.

00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:50.760
 That is cool.

00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:51.760
 Wow.

00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:56.880
 I was reading that you can know what color an egg is going to be from a chicken by looking

00:08:56.880 --> 00:08:57.880
 at its ears.

00:08:57.880 --> 00:09:00.680
 Chicken's done of external ears, do they?

00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:01.680
 They have earlobes.

00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:02.680
 Have earlobes?

00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:03.680
 Do they?

00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:04.680
 Yeah.

00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:05.680
 Prominent.

00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:06.680
 You've seen them.

00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:08.680
 I think maybe you just didn't think of them as being earlobes.

00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:09.680
 Yeah.

00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:13.160
 So if they have white earlobes, they'll have white eggs.

00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:16.600
 And if they have red earlobes, they'll have brown eggs.

00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:20.000
 This, the article stresses, is not always the case.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:21.000
 Right.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:22.000
 OK.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:26.120
 But they do say that it's something that people have noticed more often than not.

00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:27.520
 It's almost always the case, I think.

00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:30.320
 You can tell it's going to be a color similar to the earlobes.

00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:33.880
 Are you, Andy, as imagining a chicken with human ears?

00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:34.880
 Yeah.

00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:35.880
 Yeah.

00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:36.880
 And it's disgusting.

00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:37.880
 Yeah.

00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:38.880
 You ever seen a chicken?

00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:39.880
 Do you know what a chicken is?

00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:40.880
 Yeah.

00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:41.880
 OK.

00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:42.880
 Yeah.

00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:43.880
 I just was, because this is your fact.

00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:47.120
 So I was just checking you had Google chicken before you came in here.

00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:48.120
 Yeah.

00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:50.960
 I think it's not the first thing you see when you look at a chicken, though, is it?

00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:54.000
 You see the feathers and you see the beak.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:55.520
 It's not the initial--

00:09:55.520 --> 00:09:58.880
 And sometimes the little feathery trousers, you know, the little spurs they have.

00:09:58.880 --> 00:09:59.880
 Those are pretty cute.

00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:00.880
 Oh, yeah.

00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:02.360
 Those were the big cowboys told.

00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:05.760
 But it's not like elephants were the first thing you see as there is.

00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:06.760
 Yeah.

00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:09.400
 The first thing you see on an elephant is the trunks, James.

00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:11.400
 Well, I'm looking for the side.

00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:12.400
 Yeah.

00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:14.400
 It's facing away from you.

00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:15.360
 I can't catch a slay.

00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:21.600
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:24.400
 OK, it is time to move on to fact number two.

00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:26.240
 And that is James.

00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:30.000
 OK, my fact this week is that the former prime minister of Georgia

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:34.240
 has started taking famous trees from around his country, digging them up,

00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:37.840
 and then planting them in his own garden.

00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:39.720
 He's like, he's personally digging them up.

00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:40.560
 He's digging them up.

00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:41.560
 It's amazing.

00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:45.240
 So I was re-- so for our book, which is coming out in November,

00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:47.800
 I was reading about the world geopolitical situation.

00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:49.680
 And there's things happening in Georgia.

00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:52.800
 There's elections in Abkhazia where they're trying to get out of Georgia.

00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:55.120
 And while I was reading that, I came across this guy.

00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:57.520
 And I can't believe I've never heard about him before.

00:10:57.520 --> 00:11:01.840
 He's called Bidzina Ivanishvili, and he's taking trees from around the country,

00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:04.120
 and I've had driving them or putting them on a ship,

00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:06.920
 and then taking them to his house and planting them.

00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:08.440
 And he says, it's my hobby.

00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:10.200
 I really love big trees.

00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:13.160
 Giant trees are my entertainments.

00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:16.040
 How many famous trees are there in Georgia?

00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:17.080
 And not as many as they used to be.

00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:17.920
 Ah.

00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:20.120
 [LAUGHTER]

00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:21.000
 So this is the thing.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:25.120
 He reckons that it's a good idea, because before the people who have the trees on their land

00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:26.680
 might not have been properly looking after them.

00:11:26.680 --> 00:11:31.160
 And so if he puts them on his land, then he'll be able to look after them on his arboretum.

00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:33.200
 But ecologists are skeptical.

00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:37.640
 Well, it does say, doesn't he, though, that he'll plant 10 trees for everyone that he takes away?

00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:39.400
 Or I think at least he did that for one of them.

00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:41.320
 He did that for this giant tulip tree.

00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:43.840
 It was a 650-ton tulip tree.

00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:44.840
 Whoa.

00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:47.160
 I thought tulips were like small.

00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:49.480
 Yeah, I thought they were as well.

00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:52.040
 I guess this is just one 650-ton tulip.

00:11:52.040 --> 00:11:53.960
 Yeah, well, you know his context, actually.

00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:55.200
 It's all in the way the photo's done.

00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:57.560
 So you know those fields of tulips you see in the Netherlands.

00:11:57.560 --> 00:11:58.920
 Those are actually all massive.

00:11:58.920 --> 00:11:59.920
 [LAUGHTER]

00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:01.400
 Well, you do see the upwind mill, though.

00:12:01.400 --> 00:12:03.800
 So maybe Dutch windmills are absolutely massive.

00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:04.600
 They're even bigger.

00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:05.400
 I bet.

00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:06.720
 Maybe he's just chuping them all.

00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:08.360
 Maybe he's told them it's a tulip tree.

00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:10.760
 So he's like, oh, I'll just give you these extra tulip seeds.

00:12:10.760 --> 00:12:13.800
 You could have 10 of them, cab as well as you want.

00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:15.400
 This guy, he does sound amazing, though.

00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:16.560
 He is incredible.

00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:18.680
 And he's got this mansion, hasn't he, which

00:12:18.680 --> 00:12:20.880
 is kind of disgusting, if you look it up.

00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:24.120
 And it's basically, it is the James Bond mansion.

00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:26.280
 It's like a giant glass spaceship.

00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:27.080
 Yeah.

00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:29.120
 And it's on a mountain side, isn't it?

00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:31.120
 So it overlooks the capital of his country

00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:32.320
 from a mountain side.

00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:33.160
 Yeah.

00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:35.000
 So the indie went and interviewed him.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:38.280
 And when he went there, he said,

00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:42.400
 there are eight different breeds of peacock and I have them all.

00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:46.280
 So he really likes collecting loads of stuff, basically.

00:12:46.280 --> 00:12:47.920
 Yeah, he has loads of animals, doesn't he?

00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:51.600
 He has zebras, what else do you see?

00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:52.320
 Kangaroos.

00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:53.720
 Kangaroos, penguins.

00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:56.640
 He is also rumored to have a shark tank.

00:12:56.640 --> 00:12:58.080
 He does, yeah.

00:12:58.080 --> 00:13:00.680
 Yeah, he does because he has to keep importing loads of salt

00:13:00.680 --> 00:13:03.120
 for it all the time, I think, like gallons of salt.

00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:04.760
 Apparently, in the whole way of his house,

00:13:04.760 --> 00:13:07.680
 he has a work by Gilbert and George with a slogan that says,

00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:10.320
 "Say fuck off to rich bastards."

00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:13.800
 His net worth is $4.8 billion.

00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:17.760
 Yeah, I think his net worth is like 50% of the GDP of Georgia,

00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:18.600
 doesn't it?

00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:19.120
 No, no.

00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:21.280
 It's between a third and a half, depending on which source you read.

00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:22.920
 But it is, yeah.

00:13:22.920 --> 00:13:25.040
 Well, he sounds like the right man to be the former leader

00:13:25.040 --> 00:13:26.040
 of the country, doesn't he?

00:13:26.040 --> 00:13:26.560
 Yeah.

00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:28.320
 If he is, basically, the GDP of Georgia.

00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:28.960
 Well, indeed.

00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:30.080
 Yeah, that's true.

00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:32.560
 And just quickly, on trees in Georgia,

00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:34.000
 I don't think I'm going to get another chance

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:35.840
 to get my trees in Georgia factor out of this.

00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:36.840
 Well, that's what I have next week.

00:13:36.840 --> 00:13:37.440
 Yeah, it's possible.

00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:38.840
 You could put it in the book.

00:13:38.840 --> 00:13:39.840
 Oh, yeah.

00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:43.040
 Well, just in case I don't do that.

00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:45.840
 So basically, Georgia breed Christmas trees.

00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:48.320
 And you know the tree that we call the nordman fur

00:13:48.320 --> 00:13:49.520
 and it gets called the Caucasian fur.

00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:52.360
 It's basically the famous Christmas tree in Europe,

00:13:52.360 --> 00:13:56.600
 as in 45 million gets sold all around Western Europe each year.

00:13:56.600 --> 00:13:59.760
 These trees are grown elsewhere,

00:13:59.760 --> 00:14:01.440
 but they're originally from Georgia,

00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:05.040
 as in the seeds that grow them, or from Georgian Christmas trees.

00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:06.960
 And people in Georgia climb up them

00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:07.960
 and they're massive.

00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:09.040
 OK, so it's quite dangerous.

00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:10.440
 There are fatalities every year.

00:14:10.440 --> 00:14:13.200
 They collect the cones, which have got the seeds inside them,

00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:15.400
 and then they sell the seeds to places like Denmark.

00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:17.520
 And then Denmark actually does the work of growing

00:14:17.520 --> 00:14:18.280
 and selling the trees.

00:14:18.280 --> 00:14:20.720
 But Georgia misses out, because obviously,

00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:22.160
 you need loads and loads of pine cones.

00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:23.440
 And then they get sold for much more.

00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:26.000
 It's like drugs, you know, it starts off quite cheap.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.920
 But the street value of these trees is massive.

00:14:28.920 --> 00:14:31.240
 So the Georgians, I think, they want to break into that

00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:32.320
 and start growing their own trees.

00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:33.720
 Say no to pinecons, kids.

00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:35.200
 Yeah.

00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:37.680
 Hey, while we're just on Christmas trees,

00:14:37.680 --> 00:14:42.800
 did you guys know that elephants floss using Christmas trees?

00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:43.800
 Mm.

00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:44.560
 Have you guys heard that?

00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:45.080
 No.

00:14:45.080 --> 00:14:46.280
 I don't think that's true.

00:14:46.280 --> 00:14:47.280
 It's true.

00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:47.800
 It's true.

00:14:47.800 --> 00:14:49.920
 Elephants floss using Christmas trees.

00:14:49.920 --> 00:14:51.200
 At least that's what I read.

00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:53.320
 In Germany, they've got this tradition every year.

00:14:53.320 --> 00:14:56.640
 So they give their Christmas trees to the elephants at the zoo.

00:14:56.640 --> 00:14:58.440
 And people just hand over their trees.

00:14:58.440 --> 00:14:59.600
 And the elephants eat them.

00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:01.680
 They can get through like three trees a day.

00:15:01.680 --> 00:15:03.560
 But they also have been seen flossing with them.

00:15:03.560 --> 00:15:06.480
 So I guess flossing the tree out of their teeth.

00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:08.520
 But holding it with their trunk and then in and out

00:15:08.520 --> 00:15:09.840
 between their teeth.

00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:11.560
 Yeah, I mean, I haven't seen any pictures myself.

00:15:11.560 --> 00:15:14.080
 They must be because they don't have opposable thumbs today.

00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:15.280
 So it must be with their trunk.

00:15:15.280 --> 00:15:17.200
 That's the only prehand style part of their body.

00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:17.720
 Yeah.

00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:20.360
 But it's weird that you would try and get a tree out with a tree.

00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:22.120
 And how would it not be?

00:15:22.120 --> 00:15:23.800
 Would it not be that that tree would get stuck?

00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:24.320
 Oh, yeah.

00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:25.880
 Then you get a slightly larger tree.

00:15:25.880 --> 00:15:29.520
 It's the elephant version of the old woman who swallowed a fly.

00:15:29.520 --> 00:15:31.040
 It's the elephant who flossed with a Christmas tree.

00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:32.560
 Yeah.

00:15:32.560 --> 00:15:34.840
 Eventually has to swallow a tulip tree, which

00:15:34.840 --> 00:15:37.280
 is the biggest on Earth, apparently.

00:15:37.280 --> 00:15:39.840
 Speaking of trees, by the way, very quickly, we have just

00:15:39.840 --> 00:15:41.800
 discovered that there were more trees on Earth

00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:43.520
 than we thought there were.

00:15:43.520 --> 00:15:47.520
 So there are now 427 million hectares more

00:15:47.520 --> 00:15:49.560
 trees than we thought there were on Earth.

00:15:49.560 --> 00:15:51.360
 How many did I think there were?

00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:55.280
 427 million hectares less than the number you've got in your head.

00:15:55.280 --> 00:15:55.800
 Yeah.

00:15:55.800 --> 00:15:58.360
 So minus that from whatever you've had

00:15:58.360 --> 00:16:00.040
 to put it into context, by the way.

00:16:00.040 --> 00:16:04.840
 That is, if all that tree, the new tree was put into a place,

00:16:04.840 --> 00:16:09.120
 a single place, it would take up 60% of the surface of Australia.

00:16:09.120 --> 00:16:11.360
 That's actually kind of less than I thought it would be.

00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:11.880
 Yeah.

00:16:11.880 --> 00:16:15.040
 But no, is that only the bonus trees that we've got?

00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:16.280
 It's not all the trees in the world, is it?

00:16:16.280 --> 00:16:16.640
 Yeah, yeah.

00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:19.440
 That's the extra bonus trees.

00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:22.320
 So we can't just go nuts and start cutting down all the trees.

00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:24.600
 Because we're the prime minister of Georgia.

00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:25.840
 Well, the ex prime minister of Georgia.

00:16:25.840 --> 00:16:28.600
 What it does mean is that he's got a lot more to collect now.

00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:30.480
 But he's not collecting every tree.

00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:32.680
 He's just collecting individual examples.

00:16:32.680 --> 00:16:34.320
 Is he collecting all the trees in the world?

00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:35.440
 That is the famous tree.

00:16:35.440 --> 00:16:36.440
 Oh, we don't know, do we?

00:16:36.440 --> 00:16:38.280
 Because we only know where he's got to sell far.

00:16:38.280 --> 00:16:39.280
 We don't know where he's going to start.

00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:40.960
 Because maybe he's starting with the most famous.

00:16:40.960 --> 00:16:43.920
 But his list includes every single tree on the planet.

00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:45.200
 And he's just working his way down.

00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:46.240
 That's the least famous tree.

00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:47.000
 Exactly, yeah.

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:48.760
 What is the least famous tree?

00:16:48.760 --> 00:16:49.440
 Nobody knows.

00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:51.200
 That was the thing.

00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:54.040
 Well, only he knows, and his mother.

00:16:54.040 --> 00:16:56.880
 Did I ever tell you guys that my dad--

00:16:56.880 --> 00:16:58.800
 so I used to live when I was born in Hong Kong.

00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:01.760
 We lived in an island just off Hong Kong called Discovery Bay.

00:17:01.760 --> 00:17:03.240
 And my parents lived in this house.

00:17:03.240 --> 00:17:05.320
 And next door to them, their neighbor

00:17:05.320 --> 00:17:06.840
 had a tree in their front yard.

00:17:06.840 --> 00:17:08.680
 And my dad used to love this tree.

00:17:08.680 --> 00:17:10.800
 He just used to think, I want one day to have a tree

00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:12.440
 in my front yard as well.

00:17:12.440 --> 00:17:13.880
 And so he went out.

00:17:13.880 --> 00:17:15.680
 He got really drunk one night.

00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:17.160
 And he came back.

00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:19.200
 And he doesn't really remember what happened.

00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:21.840
 But in the morning, my mom went outside, opened the doors,

00:17:21.840 --> 00:17:25.120
 and went, Roger, what have you done?

00:17:25.120 --> 00:17:27.680
 And he quickly jumped up, and he saw what he must have done

00:17:27.680 --> 00:17:30.200
 in his drug and state, which is clearly he was walking home.

00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:33.560
 He saw the tree, thought, god damn it, I want that tree.

00:17:33.560 --> 00:17:36.680
 So he dug it up, and he brought the tree over,

00:17:36.680 --> 00:17:39.080
 and he planted it in our front yard.

00:17:39.080 --> 00:17:39.600
 No way.

00:17:39.600 --> 00:17:43.120
 But what he had failed to do was to cover up his tracks.

00:17:43.120 --> 00:17:46.480
 So he saw the tree planted beautifully in our yard

00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:48.880
 with a huge trail of debris and dirt

00:17:48.880 --> 00:17:53.240
 leading to a gigantic hole sitting in our neighbor's front yard.

00:17:53.240 --> 00:17:54.440
 Amazing.

00:17:54.440 --> 00:17:56.720
 Do you know what I think, actually, even without that trail

00:17:56.720 --> 00:17:58.280
 of earth, your neighbor might have just

00:17:58.280 --> 00:18:00.680
 about figured out when we're going on there?

00:18:00.680 --> 00:18:01.480
 I know.

00:18:01.480 --> 00:18:03.680
 I know that swing.

00:18:03.680 --> 00:18:07.520
 You're saying that your dad, when drunk, on his way home,

00:18:07.520 --> 00:18:11.000
 dug up a tree, presumably he was just on his way home,

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:12.960
 so he wasn't carrying his spade with him.

00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:15.640
 So the implication is, he dug it up with his bare hands.

00:18:15.640 --> 00:18:18.480
 Also, I can only imagine Dan's dad likes trees

00:18:18.480 --> 00:18:20.760
 that are tree size, so it must be pretty big, right?

00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:23.560
 So he dug out this tree, all he thought of that tree

00:18:23.560 --> 00:18:25.960
 went home, got the spade.

00:18:25.960 --> 00:18:28.800
 Well, home was just next door, so it was very convenient.

00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:33.320
 He could have dug it up with a cart, and he got his cababin.

00:18:33.320 --> 00:18:34.080
 Yes.

00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:34.600
 You're right.

00:18:34.600 --> 00:18:37.040
 It was in Australia, Hong Kong, sorry.

00:18:37.040 --> 00:18:41.320
 Hong Kong, all cabab cartons are made of reinforced steel

00:18:41.320 --> 00:18:43.240
 in case of burning your hands.

00:18:43.240 --> 00:18:44.400
 By the way, he put the tree back,

00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:47.320
 so no one needs suppressed criminal charges or anything.

00:18:47.320 --> 00:18:49.200
 I don't know if the guy ever noticed, by the way.

00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:51.320
 My mom woke up really early in the morning,

00:18:51.320 --> 00:18:52.760
 unless he was a very late riser.

00:18:52.760 --> 00:18:54.800
 I think he probably noticed.

00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:57.800
 So your dad may be replanted it before this guy woke up?

00:18:57.800 --> 00:18:58.640
 Yes, I have.

00:18:58.640 --> 00:19:01.320
 He may be wake-up, he's like, this is orientated.

00:19:01.320 --> 00:19:03.800
 Just slightly different.

00:19:03.800 --> 00:19:06.280
 That swing was on the other side.

00:19:06.280 --> 00:19:09.760
 That poor guy is a mental help from the rest of his life.

00:19:09.760 --> 00:19:11.680
 Just had a nervous breakdown.

00:19:11.680 --> 00:19:13.320
 He actually invented the character of Groot

00:19:13.320 --> 00:19:17.480
 for the Guardians of the Galaxy film about a mischievous tree.

00:19:17.480 --> 00:19:20.000
 Just quickly, while we're talking about moving trees,

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:24.400
 whether illegally or legally or with a polystyrene carton,

00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:26.080
 if you don't have a polystyrene carton down,

00:19:26.080 --> 00:19:27.880
 you can get these unbelievably cool things,

00:19:27.880 --> 00:19:29.880
 and they're called tree spades.

00:19:29.880 --> 00:19:32.080
 So they're these massive boxes, right?

00:19:32.080 --> 00:19:34.960
 They look like a big space egg.

00:19:34.960 --> 00:19:36.600
 And you surround the tree with it.

00:19:36.600 --> 00:19:38.960
 I don't know quite where you uncouple it

00:19:38.960 --> 00:19:39.920
 and surround the tree.

00:19:39.920 --> 00:19:43.800
 And then what it does is it has these massive round-edged blades

00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:46.880
 which dig into the ground, very carefully lift up

00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:49.200
 the entire tree, roots and everything.

00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:51.000
 And then they can tilt it sideways

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:54.760
 and put it onto, for example, the side of a van or whatever.

00:19:54.760 --> 00:19:55.760
 That's so cool.

00:19:55.760 --> 00:19:57.840
 Or probably on the back of a van, not the side of a van.

00:19:57.840 --> 00:19:59.040
 Yeah, yeah.

00:19:59.040 --> 00:19:59.640
 That's amazing.

00:19:59.640 --> 00:20:02.120
 That sounds like it's given it a pot.

00:20:02.120 --> 00:20:03.720
 Like it's the egg shape underneath.

00:20:03.720 --> 00:20:05.800
 It's just created the pot for a standard.

00:20:05.800 --> 00:20:07.440
 And the really cool thing is they've been doing this

00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:10.360
 for hundreds of years, or at least, I think, 150 years,

00:20:10.360 --> 00:20:11.640
 as they were doing this in Brooklyn,

00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:13.200
 but just without the big mechanical element.

00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:15.680
 But they still had these cool devices, too.

00:20:15.680 --> 00:20:18.640
 So without the mechanical element, it's just a spade.

00:20:18.640 --> 00:20:21.480
 Well, yeah, they have spades.

00:20:21.480 --> 00:20:22.840
 They have spades, the other spades.

00:20:22.840 --> 00:20:24.400
 The spades goes back 150 years.

00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:25.640
 Not a lot of people know that.

00:20:25.640 --> 00:20:27.480
 No, they have these big tree-moving wagons.

00:20:27.480 --> 00:20:28.520
 Oh, right.

00:20:28.520 --> 00:20:29.040
 Yeah.

00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:31.680
 So they put them onto the wagon sideways, do they?

00:20:31.680 --> 00:20:32.680
 Yeah.

00:20:32.680 --> 00:20:35.080
 The Prime Minister of George, or the ex-Prime Minister of George,

00:20:35.080 --> 00:20:35.840
 it didn't do that.

00:20:35.840 --> 00:20:38.600
 He sent his sticking upwards.

00:20:38.600 --> 00:20:39.120
 No.

00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:41.280
 Yeah, so there's some amazing pictures online.

00:20:41.280 --> 00:20:43.480
 I'll try and put them on my Twitter.

00:20:43.480 --> 00:20:47.080
 There's one where he has a tree on a kind of a raft.

00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:50.120
 And he's taking it on the black sea, and it's just sticking up.

00:20:50.120 --> 00:20:51.120
 That's the way it is.

00:20:51.120 --> 00:20:52.320
 They look incredible.

00:20:52.320 --> 00:20:53.200
 You should look at the pictures.

00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:53.720
 Incredible.

00:20:53.720 --> 00:20:55.200
 If you took it from someone's land,

00:20:55.200 --> 00:20:57.280
 you wouldn't necessarily know he was stealing it.

00:20:57.280 --> 00:20:59.600
 It just might look like, oh, it looks a bit further away today.

00:20:59.600 --> 00:21:01.680
 I'm sure you'll have it.

00:21:01.680 --> 00:21:02.200
 Exactly.

00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:04.640
 So then he took them along the coastline of the black sea,

00:21:04.640 --> 00:21:07.280
 but the coastline of the black sea is really shallow.

00:21:07.280 --> 00:21:08.840
 And so he got stuck there.

00:21:08.840 --> 00:21:13.720
 And so he then had to make a new road to take a trail on.

00:21:13.720 --> 00:21:15.640
 And then that road collapsed.

00:21:15.640 --> 00:21:17.280
 So he had to make a new road.

00:21:17.280 --> 00:21:20.760
 And also, one time he took a tree on the highway,

00:21:20.760 --> 00:21:22.240
 and it was a magnolia tree.

00:21:22.240 --> 00:21:25.240
 And when he was taking it, it got stuck on a eucalyptus tree

00:21:25.240 --> 00:21:27.800
 that was growing on the side of the road, so it's kind of angled.

00:21:27.800 --> 00:21:29.920
 Did it take the eucalyptus tree with it?

00:21:29.920 --> 00:21:31.240
 Was it just like a tree chain?

00:21:31.240 --> 00:21:34.280
 I don't buy one, get one tree.

00:21:34.280 --> 00:21:35.480
 He's a hell of a lot of hassle.

00:21:35.480 --> 00:21:37.000
 There's a whole bit of it, isn't it?

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:38.200
 Yeah, his wife's probably saying

00:21:38.200 --> 00:21:40.480
 you need to collect something smaller.

00:21:40.480 --> 00:21:42.160
 Or maybe he's just getting drunk every night

00:21:42.160 --> 00:21:44.360
 and finding these trees in his garden every night.

00:21:44.360 --> 00:21:46.080
 [LAUGHTER]

00:21:46.080 --> 00:21:49.200
 Just because you mentioned Christmas trees earlier,

00:21:49.200 --> 00:21:51.720
 I was reading this amazing story about the Christmas tree

00:21:51.720 --> 00:21:53.960
 shipping industry, which used to be huge in the US.

00:21:53.960 --> 00:21:56.640
 They used to ship hundreds of Christmas trees on ships.

00:21:56.640 --> 00:22:00.320
 And there was this particular famous ship called the Rouse Simmon Ship.

00:22:00.320 --> 00:22:03.320
 And it used to carry thousands of trees.

00:22:03.320 --> 00:22:08.080
 And then in 1912, it had this very famous accident, and it sank.

00:22:08.080 --> 00:22:11.800
 So it was carrying 5,500 trees from Michigan to Chicago,

00:22:11.800 --> 00:22:13.080
 across Lake Michigan.

00:22:13.080 --> 00:22:14.960
 And it was captain by this guy called Sherman,

00:22:14.960 --> 00:22:17.920
 who was so famous as a Christmas tree importer

00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:20.080
 that people called him Captain Santa.

00:22:20.080 --> 00:22:23.720
 And he used to go-- he used to land in Chicago.

00:22:23.720 --> 00:22:25.800
 And he really liked giving out Christmas trees to the poor

00:22:25.800 --> 00:22:27.200
 and people who couldn't afford Christmas.

00:22:27.200 --> 00:22:27.960
 What do you know?

00:22:27.960 --> 00:22:30.160
 It doesn't quite make sense, because Santa arrives

00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:32.240
 after the tree has been sorted out.

00:22:32.240 --> 00:22:34.960
 Basically, Santa doesn't bring the tree down the chimney.

00:22:34.960 --> 00:22:37.200
 Maybe Captain Santa comes and sorts that out.

00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:39.240
 Santa's like Santa's boss, isn't it?

00:22:39.240 --> 00:22:42.920
 Santa just left ten and Santa is his full size.

00:22:42.920 --> 00:22:44.360
 They should give him his full title.

00:22:44.360 --> 00:22:47.000
 It's very confusing and that's so cool.

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:49.760
 So Captain Santa used to do this.

00:22:49.760 --> 00:22:52.200
 And then there was this awful, there's a storm that sunk the whole ship

00:22:52.200 --> 00:22:55.280
 and it killed everyone on board and all the trees sunk.

00:22:55.280 --> 00:22:57.800
 So for years, afterwards, fishermen on Lake Michigan

00:22:57.800 --> 00:23:02.120
 would catch huge Christmas tree catch.

00:23:02.120 --> 00:23:05.160
 What I quite like is, first of all, his business partner,

00:23:05.160 --> 00:23:06.640
 who would always wait in Chicago with him,

00:23:06.640 --> 00:23:10.040
 was called Claude Winters, quite nice numbers of determinism.

00:23:10.040 --> 00:23:12.760
 Wow, yeah, and also Captain Santa Claude Winters.

00:23:12.760 --> 00:23:15.640
 It's one letter away from Santa Claude's Winters.

00:23:15.640 --> 00:23:16.880
 Yes, yeah.

00:23:16.880 --> 00:23:17.840
 OK.

00:23:17.840 --> 00:23:21.440
 Anyway, just the other bizarre thing about this accident

00:23:21.440 --> 00:23:24.680
 was that the Captain Santa left a message in a bottle

00:23:24.680 --> 00:23:26.160
 when he knew the ship was in trouble.

00:23:26.160 --> 00:23:29.840
 And he corked it using the small piece of a cut pine tree

00:23:29.840 --> 00:23:31.560
 from one of the trees that was on board.

00:23:31.560 --> 00:23:33.640
 And he left this message and it got picked up.

00:23:33.640 --> 00:23:36.280
 And the message just said, everybody, goodbye.

00:23:36.280 --> 00:23:40.640
 I guess we are all through leaking bad God help us.

00:23:40.640 --> 00:23:44.320
 Leaking bad, that sounds like a new Netflix show, doesn't it?

00:23:44.320 --> 00:23:45.200
 It's about the White House.

00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:55.520
 OK, it is time for fact number three.

00:23:55.520 --> 00:23:56.920
 And that is my fact.

00:23:56.920 --> 00:24:00.280
 My fact this week is that US military medics

00:24:00.280 --> 00:24:03.680
 use longer needles than normal because soldiers

00:24:03.680 --> 00:24:06.840
 are often too buff for the regular ones.

00:24:06.840 --> 00:24:09.760
 I think this sounds like a boast by the American army.

00:24:09.760 --> 00:24:11.320
 Yeah, it does, doesn't it?

00:24:11.320 --> 00:24:13.480
 Yeah, you should see the size of our condoms.

00:24:13.480 --> 00:24:16.120
 It's just a bit too convenient.

00:24:16.120 --> 00:24:18.080
 And it's a common thing, isn't it, in armies,

00:24:18.080 --> 00:24:21.120
 that they send like enormous condoms.

00:24:21.120 --> 00:24:22.360
 We saw Jimmy Carter the other day,

00:24:22.360 --> 00:24:24.600
 and he told us that story about Churchill.

00:24:24.600 --> 00:24:25.120
 Oh, yeah.

00:24:25.120 --> 00:24:29.400
 There was a gun where they had a sheath kind of thing put over it.

00:24:29.400 --> 00:24:30.960
 And it was made by Jurex.

00:24:30.960 --> 00:24:34.120
 And so it was like a condom, but it was the size of a machine gun.

00:24:34.120 --> 00:24:36.680
 It was the stop the gun jamming or freezing.

00:24:36.680 --> 00:24:37.840
 Yeah, that's right.

00:24:37.840 --> 00:24:41.000
 And so what they did was they got a big consignment of them.

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:44.120
 And then Churchill supposedly said, well, let's label it

00:24:44.120 --> 00:24:45.440
 to British condoms small.

00:24:45.440 --> 00:24:49.880
 So let me give you a bit of background of where

00:24:49.880 --> 00:24:50.920
 I got this fact from.

00:24:50.920 --> 00:24:54.240
 I'm reading a really good book called Grunt by Mary Roach.

00:24:54.240 --> 00:24:56.960
 And she went round looking at all innovations

00:24:56.960 --> 00:25:00.600
 going on in the military and classic Mary Roach investigation

00:25:00.600 --> 00:25:03.440
 finding out very much what we love, you know,

00:25:03.440 --> 00:25:05.280
 the quirky facts about certain things.

00:25:05.280 --> 00:25:06.480
 So this book's military.

00:25:06.480 --> 00:25:08.080
 And she spent time with a bunch of medics.

00:25:08.080 --> 00:25:12.840
 And this was told to her that basically a lot of the soldiers

00:25:12.840 --> 00:25:16.560
 are so muscular, particularly around the pecs.

00:25:16.560 --> 00:25:18.720
 And they often need to give them injections

00:25:18.720 --> 00:25:20.680
 when they're out in the field for collapse lungs.

00:25:20.680 --> 00:25:23.520
 And they were finding in autopsy's when they were doing it

00:25:23.520 --> 00:25:27.680
 later because in autopsy's, they all get an autopsy.

00:25:27.680 --> 00:25:29.560
 Any soldier that dies gets an autopsy

00:25:29.560 --> 00:25:31.600
 when they were going to check out the collapse lung

00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:33.520
 and putting the needles in, none of them were reaching.

00:25:33.520 --> 00:25:35.920
 And they thought, this is no use for the field.

00:25:35.920 --> 00:25:38.280
 So needles, I don't know if it's all the needles,

00:25:38.280 --> 00:25:39.880
 but certainly there's a lot of needles

00:25:39.880 --> 00:25:41.920
 that are extra-large long needles.

00:25:41.920 --> 00:25:42.720
 That's amazing.

00:25:42.720 --> 00:25:43.520
 Yeah.

00:25:43.520 --> 00:25:46.000
 They also have to make bigger needles for obese people,

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:46.800
 I think.

00:25:46.800 --> 00:25:47.960
 Do they, right?

00:25:47.960 --> 00:25:51.160
 They did a study with some obese people.

00:25:51.160 --> 00:25:54.800
 They put the needles into their buttocks

00:25:54.800 --> 00:25:57.640
 to see if the stuff would get to the muscles.

00:25:57.640 --> 00:26:00.560
 And they found that, in less than a third of the patients,

00:26:00.560 --> 00:26:03.680
 what they injected was getting through to where it needed to be.

00:26:03.680 --> 00:26:06.560
 So they need to start making needles, which are now longer

00:26:06.560 --> 00:26:07.840
 for obese people as well.

00:26:07.840 --> 00:26:09.920
 Terrible if you've got a fear of needles.

00:26:09.920 --> 00:26:10.440
 Yeah.

00:26:10.440 --> 00:26:13.160
 Although, so a good way of combating a fear of needles

00:26:13.160 --> 00:26:14.520
 has just been developed.

00:26:14.520 --> 00:26:18.280
 It's never have any Western medicine.

00:26:18.280 --> 00:26:19.520
 Because if you get acupuncture,

00:26:19.520 --> 00:26:22.080
 you've really gone through to that.

00:26:22.080 --> 00:26:23.760
 No, if you've got a fear of needles,

00:26:23.760 --> 00:26:25.120
 scientists have developed this thing, which

00:26:25.120 --> 00:26:27.600
 is a pill that's covered in needles that you swallow

00:26:27.600 --> 00:26:29.360
 and that injects you from the inside.

00:26:29.360 --> 00:26:29.880
 What?

00:26:29.880 --> 00:26:30.760
 And that has to get you over it.

00:26:30.760 --> 00:26:31.680
 And this is really cool.

00:26:31.680 --> 00:26:33.880
 So I think this has been tested.

00:26:33.880 --> 00:26:35.760
 It was tested on pigs the last time I read about it,

00:26:35.760 --> 00:26:36.880
 but it might have been updated.

00:26:36.880 --> 00:26:38.880
 And it was to administer insulin.

00:26:38.880 --> 00:26:40.680
 And basically, it's these little pills

00:26:40.680 --> 00:26:42.360
 and they cover them in tiny needles.

00:26:42.360 --> 00:26:44.520
 And then they have an outer coating of the pill.

00:26:44.520 --> 00:26:46.440
 And when the pill gets into your stomach,

00:26:46.440 --> 00:26:48.400
 then the outer coating of the pill dissolves.

00:26:48.400 --> 00:26:51.400
 And all these tiny needles prod the lining of your stomach.

00:26:51.400 --> 00:26:53.440
 And they administer the drug straight into your bloodstream.

00:26:53.440 --> 00:26:57.160
 But do you have to pass the needles out later on?

00:26:57.160 --> 00:26:57.680
 I think so.

00:26:57.680 --> 00:27:00.640
 But we're talking, like, one millimeter, less than a millimeter.

00:27:00.640 --> 00:27:01.240
 I don't know.

00:27:01.240 --> 00:27:03.280
 That still sounds painful.

00:27:03.280 --> 00:27:05.440
 Maybe they dissolve.

00:27:05.440 --> 00:27:06.560
 Maybe they do dissolve.

00:27:06.560 --> 00:27:08.280
 Yeah, they're really tiny.

00:27:08.280 --> 00:27:10.880
 Well, here-- OK, here's a less painful one

00:27:10.880 --> 00:27:14.480
 if you don't want to swallow needles.

00:27:14.480 --> 00:27:16.120
 This is-- this is used.

00:27:16.120 --> 00:27:18.680
 I don't know if it's-- if it was-- this is just the trial I

00:27:18.680 --> 00:27:20.480
 was reading about, but they definitely have developed this.

00:27:20.480 --> 00:27:22.120
 And it has been used.

00:27:22.120 --> 00:27:23.840
 So instead of having a morphine needle,

00:27:23.840 --> 00:27:27.560
 let's say, in order to numb you, you can, instead, now,

00:27:27.560 --> 00:27:28.680
 have a lollipop.

00:27:28.680 --> 00:27:30.560
 Wow, sticking it into your--

00:27:30.560 --> 00:27:33.040
 No, yeah, that sounds like it'd be more painful

00:27:33.040 --> 00:27:34.920
 than it would be in many ways.

00:27:34.920 --> 00:27:38.000
 I would rather have morphine if I were in pain than a lollipop.

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:39.880
 Well, actually, on any day of the week,

00:27:39.880 --> 00:27:41.360
 I'd rather have morphine than a lollipop.

00:27:41.360 --> 00:27:42.800
 Interesting, it's okay.

00:27:42.800 --> 00:27:45.840
 It's not your classic lollipop, obviously.

00:27:45.840 --> 00:27:49.760
 It's-- they call it the fentanyl lollipop.

00:27:49.760 --> 00:27:51.760
 And it's basically the drug.

00:27:51.760 --> 00:27:53.120
 So it's got a drug in the lollipop.

00:27:53.120 --> 00:27:56.360
 You eat it, and it absorbs through the tongue and the mouth.

00:27:56.360 --> 00:27:58.080
 And that's really fast, apparently.

00:27:58.080 --> 00:28:00.280
 So it spreads really quickly.

00:28:00.280 --> 00:28:02.600
 And they can also tell when you've had too much.

00:28:02.600 --> 00:28:03.480
 So because you're sucking--

00:28:03.480 --> 00:28:05.480
 Because you're going, then, then, then, then, then, then.

00:28:05.480 --> 00:28:06.320
 Exactly.

00:28:06.320 --> 00:28:07.720
 Because if it does go into--

00:28:07.720 --> 00:28:10.000
 it's a painkiller, it first goes into your tongue.

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:11.880
 It's going to be like at the dentist, isn't it, where

00:28:11.880 --> 00:28:12.480
 you can't talk?

00:28:12.480 --> 00:28:13.320
 Yes, exactly.

00:28:13.320 --> 00:28:15.480
 It must numb your tongue.

00:28:15.480 --> 00:28:18.200
 But they can, obviously, if they see that enough of the drug

00:28:18.200 --> 00:28:19.560
 has been put into the patient, they

00:28:19.560 --> 00:28:22.680
 can stop putting more by simply just taking the lollipop away.

00:28:22.680 --> 00:28:23.440
 Yeah, that one.

00:28:23.440 --> 00:28:26.560
 And then you're just going to be crying.

00:28:26.560 --> 00:28:29.120
 Because there was an art installation once

00:28:29.120 --> 00:28:32.240
 of a guy who gave babies lollipops

00:28:32.240 --> 00:28:35.080
 and then took them off them and took photos of them crying.

00:28:35.080 --> 00:28:36.120
 Oh, yeah.

00:28:36.120 --> 00:28:37.280
 That's quite controversial.

00:28:37.280 --> 00:28:40.080
 Well, unsurprisingly.

00:28:40.080 --> 00:28:41.320
 Oh, surprisingly.

00:28:41.320 --> 00:28:43.520
 Have you had one of these lollipops?

00:28:44.520 --> 00:28:45.840
 Yeah.

00:28:45.840 --> 00:28:49.360
 Do you know where the word syringe comes from?

00:28:49.360 --> 00:28:55.560
 Syring's is a thing in a bird, which makes it like a larynx.

00:28:55.560 --> 00:28:56.760
 Is it from that?

00:28:56.760 --> 00:28:58.000
 It is from the word syring's.

00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:00.240
 But I didn't know that bird thing.

00:29:00.240 --> 00:29:02.000
 Because syring's was in Greek mythology.

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:04.800
 She was-- no, he-- look, she--

00:29:04.800 --> 00:29:07.000
 Syring's-- she was a name.

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:09.440
 And she was being chased by the god Pan, right?

00:29:09.440 --> 00:29:13.040
 And then she disguised herself as some water reads.

00:29:13.040 --> 00:29:15.760
 OK, clever, but not clever enough.

00:29:15.760 --> 00:29:18.040
 Because Pan then chopped the reads off

00:29:18.040 --> 00:29:20.800
 and blew into them to make a whistling sound.

00:29:20.800 --> 00:29:23.160
 And that's where he got his pan pipes.

00:29:23.160 --> 00:29:26.680
 But it's also where the word syringe was taken from.

00:29:26.680 --> 00:29:28.760
 Because you know, it's a long thing tube of something.

00:29:28.760 --> 00:29:31.560
 That must be where the syring's of or a syring

00:29:31.560 --> 00:29:34.440
 so the bird comes from because it's the whistling sound.

00:29:34.440 --> 00:29:36.680
 And that's what they used to make their tweets.

00:29:36.680 --> 00:29:38.680
 There we go.

00:29:38.680 --> 00:29:40.520
 I have some things on mussels.

00:29:40.520 --> 00:29:41.920
 Oh, cool, yeah.

00:29:41.920 --> 00:29:46.240
 So there's a guy called Zhang Jingquan in China

00:29:46.240 --> 00:29:50.280
 who holds a world record for pulling the largest vehicle

00:29:50.280 --> 00:29:53.760
 by pressing a rice bowl onto his abdominal mussels,

00:29:53.760 --> 00:29:56.520
 creating a suction, and then attaching it to a vehicle

00:29:56.520 --> 00:29:57.640
 and pulling it.

00:29:57.640 --> 00:29:58.920
 How large was the vehicle?

00:29:58.920 --> 00:30:03.040
 It was 3,305.5 kilograms.

00:30:03.040 --> 00:30:05.920
 And he pulled it for 10 meters.

00:30:05.920 --> 00:30:07.280
 Wow.

00:30:07.280 --> 00:30:09.440
 Just through suction, that adhered.

00:30:09.440 --> 00:30:11.680
 It adhered to his muscular abdomen.

00:30:11.680 --> 00:30:13.360
 I would have thought that they would always,

00:30:13.360 --> 00:30:16.360
 because you're not flat enough to be able to put the suction

00:30:16.360 --> 00:30:17.360
 on the floor.

00:30:17.360 --> 00:30:18.720
 I'm Zhang Jingquan's.

00:30:18.720 --> 00:30:20.000
 I'm really impressed by that.

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:21.000
 That's incredible.

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:23.080
 I think he did it to impress people.

00:30:23.080 --> 00:30:23.600
 Did it--

00:30:23.600 --> 00:30:25.120
 It's worked like a trial.

00:30:25.120 --> 00:30:27.560
 It's half worked, I'd say, Anna.

00:30:27.560 --> 00:30:28.600
 And then it's worked on you.

00:30:28.600 --> 00:30:29.360
 I'm not impressed.

00:30:29.360 --> 00:30:30.320
 You're not impressed.

00:30:30.320 --> 00:30:30.840
 No, no.

00:30:30.840 --> 00:30:36.480
 He's pulled a three-ton vehicle using suction on his abdomen.

00:30:36.480 --> 00:30:38.280
 I think that's a very bad way of trying to pass

00:30:38.280 --> 00:30:39.920
 your driving test.

00:30:39.920 --> 00:30:41.120
 I think if I need--

00:30:41.120 --> 00:30:42.560
 I told you, he wasn't trying to do that.

00:30:42.560 --> 00:30:43.960
 He was trying to impress people.

00:30:43.960 --> 00:30:44.840
 Oh, I see.

00:30:44.840 --> 00:30:45.920
 Well, he hasn't done that either.

00:30:45.920 --> 00:30:46.520
 OK.

00:30:46.520 --> 00:30:49.560
 Did you guys know, one fact about the US military?

00:30:49.560 --> 00:30:50.480
 Yeah, sure.

00:30:50.480 --> 00:30:52.120
 And their pens?

00:30:52.120 --> 00:30:54.240
 Do you know they all use the same pen?

00:30:54.240 --> 00:30:55.640
 Just the one is so annoying.

00:30:55.640 --> 00:30:57.000
 They're sharing this.

00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:59.400
 Sorry, General McMaster's got the pen today.

00:30:59.400 --> 00:31:02.400
 [LAUGHTER]

00:31:02.400 --> 00:31:04.080
 Do you mean pen as a thing you write with,

00:31:04.080 --> 00:31:05.600
 or that you keep animals in?

00:31:05.600 --> 00:31:08.640
 [LAUGHTER]

00:31:08.640 --> 00:31:09.840
 Yeah, the pen they write with it's

00:31:09.840 --> 00:31:11.280
 called a Skillcraft pen.

00:31:11.280 --> 00:31:13.320
 It's the same company that's been making their pen since,

00:31:13.320 --> 00:31:16.120
 I think, the 1920s.

00:31:16.120 --> 00:31:17.960
 But apparently, every American listening

00:31:17.960 --> 00:31:19.160
 will apparently know what it is.

00:31:19.160 --> 00:31:20.640
 It's used in war zones.

00:31:20.640 --> 00:31:23.320
 It's designed to fit into US military uniforms.

00:31:23.320 --> 00:31:24.080
 And--

00:31:24.080 --> 00:31:25.080
 [LAUGHTER]

00:31:25.080 --> 00:31:27.640
 It's designed not to be so impossibly large

00:31:27.640 --> 00:31:30.360
 that it doesn't fit into a normal human pocket.

00:31:30.360 --> 00:31:31.040
 All right.

00:31:31.040 --> 00:31:32.560
 Yeah.

00:31:32.560 --> 00:31:35.080
 So they've got this pen that fits snugly into their uniforms.

00:31:35.080 --> 00:31:38.960
 It's so quickly designed that it can do that.

00:31:38.960 --> 00:31:41.400
 It can stand in for a two-inch fuse.

00:31:41.400 --> 00:31:42.480
 Apparently, it's designed for that.

00:31:42.480 --> 00:31:43.640
 I don't know how a pen does that.

00:31:43.640 --> 00:31:44.640
 What?

00:31:44.640 --> 00:31:47.200
 It comes in handy during emergency tracky otomies, which

00:31:47.200 --> 00:31:48.800
 I think a lot of people can do that.

00:31:48.800 --> 00:31:50.440
 No, pens can't do that, you know?

00:31:50.440 --> 00:31:51.440
 Oh!

00:31:51.440 --> 00:31:53.280
 Yeah, there's a study done in actually most pens

00:31:53.280 --> 00:31:55.320
 are not suitable for tracky otomies.

00:31:55.320 --> 00:31:56.800
 Well, guys, you better get the Skillcraft

00:31:56.800 --> 00:31:58.080
 if you feel like you're going to need one.

00:31:58.080 --> 00:31:59.920
 So is it where you put a pen--

00:31:59.920 --> 00:32:01.200
 OK, a pen at work?

00:32:01.200 --> 00:32:02.840
 Yeah, you'll see it moving sometimes.

00:32:02.840 --> 00:32:04.800
 Someone's choking, and then someone goes,

00:32:04.800 --> 00:32:06.160
 ah, I'm a surgeon.

00:32:06.160 --> 00:32:08.640
 And here's a biro, and I'll stick it in your neck.

00:32:08.640 --> 00:32:10.280
 And you can breathe through the pen kind of thing.

00:32:10.280 --> 00:32:12.520
 But anyway, if you're ever in that situation,

00:32:12.520 --> 00:32:13.840
 it probably won't work.

00:32:13.840 --> 00:32:15.880
 Oh, but it would have been stabbed in the neck.

00:32:15.880 --> 00:32:19.120
 Unless you have one of these special Skillcrafts.

00:32:19.120 --> 00:32:19.920
 Exactly.

00:32:19.920 --> 00:32:22.440
 Anyway, more legends about this pen.

00:32:22.440 --> 00:32:24.400
 So the main thing about it is they're all manufactured

00:32:24.400 --> 00:32:25.680
 by blind workers.

00:32:25.680 --> 00:32:28.520
 So it was set up, I think, during the Great Depression,

00:32:28.520 --> 00:32:30.640
 as a way of giving work to people who would otherwise

00:32:30.640 --> 00:32:32.480
 find it really difficult to find work.

00:32:32.480 --> 00:32:34.000
 So everyone who works in the factory

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:36.280
 makes this doesn't have sight.

00:32:36.280 --> 00:32:39.160
 And there are 16 page specifications

00:32:39.160 --> 00:32:41.200
 for exactly what the pen has to be able to do.

00:32:41.200 --> 00:32:43.840
 It needs to be able to write continuously for a mile,

00:32:43.840 --> 00:32:46.440
 and in temperatures of up to 160 degrees

00:32:46.440 --> 00:32:48.800
 and down to minus 40 degrees.

00:32:48.800 --> 00:32:50.080
 All quite important for the army.

00:32:50.080 --> 00:32:52.240
 If you've got secret messages that you need to get--

00:32:52.240 --> 00:32:54.000
 I don't know when you're going to be in the army,

00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:56.640
 and you have to write a line that's a mile long.

00:32:56.640 --> 00:32:59.560
 Well, maybe you need to show your troops the ways

00:32:59.560 --> 00:33:00.640
 of the nearest base.

00:33:00.640 --> 00:33:03.600
 Yeah, it's a mile away.

00:33:03.600 --> 00:33:05.200
 Wow, that sounds amazing.

00:33:05.200 --> 00:33:07.040
 It's surrounded by legend.

00:33:07.040 --> 00:33:08.840
 Apparently, the length of the pen

00:33:08.840 --> 00:33:12.640
 is equivalent to 150 nautical miles on Navy maps.

00:33:12.640 --> 00:33:15.680
 And that makes it easy for people in the Navy

00:33:15.680 --> 00:33:17.920
 to navigate, because they use that pen,

00:33:17.920 --> 00:33:20.120
 and they know that that equals 150 miles on the map.

00:33:20.120 --> 00:33:22.040
 I mean, they could just look at the scale of the map.

00:33:22.040 --> 00:33:23.000
 But sometimes--

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:26.160
 Because 150-- if it was 100, I could see that almost.

00:33:26.160 --> 00:33:28.560
 But 150 isn't that round the number.

00:33:28.560 --> 00:33:29.440
 Do you know what I mean?

00:33:29.440 --> 00:33:30.880
 But they need to take, like, mentally alert.

00:33:30.880 --> 00:33:34.760
 So it's important to test their math skills at the same time.

00:33:34.760 --> 00:33:36.520
 But presumably, they're two inches long,

00:33:36.520 --> 00:33:39.360
 because they can be used as a two-inch fuse.

00:33:39.360 --> 00:33:42.560
 Yeah, maybe there's a bit that's detachable.

00:33:42.560 --> 00:33:45.000
 But actually, two inches is quite a small pen.

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:46.120
 75 centimeters long.

00:33:46.120 --> 00:33:47.840
 And that obviously would fit snugly

00:33:47.840 --> 00:33:50.720
 inside the average soldier's uniform.

00:33:50.720 --> 00:33:54.720
 5 centimeters is about that long, which is a short pen.

00:33:54.720 --> 00:33:55.200
 That is.

00:33:55.200 --> 00:33:59.480
 It's like a labbrox pen, or an agus pen.

00:33:59.480 --> 00:34:01.120
 Yeah, agus pencil, yeah.

00:34:01.120 --> 00:34:02.600
 So they're not that short.

00:34:02.600 --> 00:34:04.000
 It must be a detachable bit.

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:04.840
 OK.

00:34:04.840 --> 00:34:05.340
 OK.

00:34:05.340 --> 00:34:07.240
 And you just thought I wanted to know about the SkullCraft pen.

00:34:07.240 --> 00:34:08.240
 That's great.

00:34:08.240 --> 00:34:09.280
 Very cool.

00:34:09.280 --> 00:34:11.320
 I have one more thing about needles.

00:34:11.320 --> 00:34:14.560
 So you know how mosquitoes bite you?

00:34:14.560 --> 00:34:15.520
 Yeah, yeah.

00:34:15.520 --> 00:34:20.200
 They've got six different needles, which I didn't know.

00:34:20.200 --> 00:34:23.400
 Yeah, so they have this really complicated multi-part drill

00:34:23.400 --> 00:34:23.600
 bit.

00:34:23.600 --> 00:34:26.560
 So they have two which drill through the skin.

00:34:26.560 --> 00:34:30.960
 They have two more which hold the edges of your skin apart.

00:34:30.960 --> 00:34:34.680
 And there's a fifth one which drops saliva into you to stop

00:34:34.680 --> 00:34:35.400
 your blood clotting.

00:34:35.400 --> 00:34:38.360
 And then there's the sixth one which actually sucks the blood up.

00:34:38.360 --> 00:34:40.800
 But that's not even the cool thing.

00:34:40.800 --> 00:34:43.760
 The cool thing is how much volume would you say of blood?

00:34:43.760 --> 00:34:45.800
 Mosquito can fit inside it.

00:34:45.800 --> 00:34:47.160
 Well, the hand gesture you're making

00:34:47.160 --> 00:34:49.000
 is about large melon size.

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:51.600
 OK, so how much is the mosquito?

00:34:51.600 --> 00:34:55.960
 Yeah, so I would say it could fill 50% of its body.

00:34:55.960 --> 00:34:58.040
 50% of its body, OK?

00:34:58.040 --> 00:34:58.960
 Four-year-old child.

00:34:58.960 --> 00:34:59.960
 OK.

00:34:59.960 --> 00:35:05.320
 So if you look at ticks on--

00:35:05.320 --> 00:35:06.440
 Yeah, yeah.

00:35:06.440 --> 00:35:07.440
 They can get much bigger.

00:35:07.440 --> 00:35:09.720
 Then they get about 1,000% of their own body.

00:35:09.720 --> 00:35:11.280
 Well, here's what the mosquito says.

00:35:11.280 --> 00:35:14.880
 Mosquitoes can fit 10 times as much blood into them

00:35:14.880 --> 00:35:16.560
 as the size of a mosquito.

00:35:16.560 --> 00:35:17.840
 Not through swelling up.

00:35:17.840 --> 00:35:18.840
 Wow.

00:35:18.840 --> 00:35:21.160
 What they do is, as her gut fills up,

00:35:21.160 --> 00:35:25.000
 the female mosquito separates the water in the blood she's

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:27.720
 sucking up from the actual red blood cells.

00:35:27.720 --> 00:35:31.080
 And she squeezes the water out of her bottom

00:35:31.080 --> 00:35:32.920
 so she can fit more red blood cells, which

00:35:32.920 --> 00:35:34.360
 is the good stuff that you can get.

00:35:34.360 --> 00:35:36.880
 So does that mean that when a mosquito's biting you,

00:35:36.880 --> 00:35:39.240
 it's also pissing?

00:35:39.240 --> 00:35:40.280
 Well, it's your blood, though.

00:35:40.280 --> 00:35:41.720
 It's the water from your blood, then.

00:35:41.720 --> 00:35:42.840
 Yeah, but it doesn't matter where--

00:35:42.840 --> 00:35:44.320
 When you're at 80, it doesn't matter.

00:35:44.320 --> 00:35:45.760
 It's like, no, this isn't urine,

00:35:45.760 --> 00:35:47.880
 because I was drinking orange juice earlier, right?

00:35:47.880 --> 00:35:52.120
 Yeah, it's orange juice officer.

00:35:52.120 --> 00:35:53.800
 It's just orange juice I'm pouring away here.

00:35:53.800 --> 00:35:56.720
 Please tell the rest of me.

00:35:56.720 --> 00:35:58.600
 Also, at that point, is it a mosquito

00:35:58.600 --> 00:36:01.920
 with blood in it, or is it a lot of blood?

00:36:01.920 --> 00:36:03.320
 It's with a mosquito around it.

00:36:03.320 --> 00:36:04.120
 It's actually both.

00:36:04.120 --> 00:36:04.720
 Is it?

00:36:04.720 --> 00:36:05.720
 Yeah.

00:36:05.720 --> 00:36:08.720
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:36:08.720 --> 00:36:13.920
 OK, it is time for our final fact of the show.

00:36:13.920 --> 00:36:15.920
 And that is Chazinski.

00:36:15.920 --> 00:36:19.040
 My fact is that if you drew a dot in indelible ink

00:36:19.040 --> 00:36:21.800
 on your eardrum, it would appear on the outside of your ear

00:36:21.800 --> 00:36:23.120
 within a few weeks.

00:36:23.120 --> 00:36:25.400
 Are you using the skill craft pen?

00:36:25.400 --> 00:36:27.200
 So beloved by the US Army.

00:36:27.200 --> 00:36:28.400
 Yeah, also--

00:36:28.400 --> 00:36:30.640
 I was just thinking the skill craft pen would be good

00:36:30.640 --> 00:36:34.880
 if you wanted to put it in the cloaca of chickens.

00:36:34.880 --> 00:36:37.720
 Specifically designed to fit in the chicken cloaca.

00:36:37.720 --> 00:36:38.320
 Yeah.

00:36:38.320 --> 00:36:39.120
 And in a human ear.

00:36:39.120 --> 00:36:42.600
 And also, a chickens cloaca, if you put it on a map,

00:36:42.600 --> 00:36:46.480
 it's exactly 150 kilopters.

00:36:46.480 --> 00:36:48.120
 If you don't have your pen.

00:36:48.120 --> 00:36:50.320
 But it messes up the map.

00:36:50.320 --> 00:36:52.040
 Where's the hazard work?

00:36:52.040 --> 00:36:52.880
 What do you mean?

00:36:52.880 --> 00:36:53.880
 It's amazing.

00:36:53.880 --> 00:36:56.560
 So the way the eardrum works is that the skin

00:36:56.560 --> 00:36:58.960
 grows outwards in a spiral, because it

00:36:58.960 --> 00:37:02.000
 needs to carry dead skin out away from the eardrum,

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:04.360
 and then to the outside world where it falls off.

00:37:04.360 --> 00:37:09.560
 And it grows at about the same rate as fingernails, I think.

00:37:09.560 --> 00:37:11.800
 And so the skin starts off in your eardrum.

00:37:11.800 --> 00:37:14.320
 And then it's carried out, picks up earwax, picks up all the dust,

00:37:14.320 --> 00:37:16.560
 transports it outside the ear, falls out.

00:37:16.560 --> 00:37:20.680
 Same speed as continent's move, because they always say

00:37:20.680 --> 00:37:22.120
 that's the same as a fingernail, don't they?

00:37:22.120 --> 00:37:23.120
 They do.

00:37:23.120 --> 00:37:26.640
 Wait, so-- and also, it's a bit like a conveyor belt system?

00:37:26.640 --> 00:37:27.240
 Exactly.

00:37:27.240 --> 00:37:29.120
 And it's all the skin on your body.

00:37:29.120 --> 00:37:30.800
 Does that originate in the ear?

00:37:30.800 --> 00:37:33.640
 Or does it-- does it start?

00:37:33.640 --> 00:37:36.240
 Is there a barrier where it stops growing outwards?

00:37:36.240 --> 00:37:39.360
 If you drew a little start on your eardrum,

00:37:39.360 --> 00:37:43.440
 then it just moves around the body.

00:37:43.440 --> 00:37:48.080
 You'd have it if you want to get a tattoo very slowly.

00:37:48.080 --> 00:37:49.080
 How did you get that--

00:37:49.080 --> 00:37:51.480
 I'm not saying that the body is built

00:37:51.480 --> 00:37:53.560
 from the earwax.

00:37:53.560 --> 00:37:55.560
 It just falls off, and you leave it behind.

00:37:55.560 --> 00:37:57.640
 But it must fall off at a certain point.

00:37:57.640 --> 00:37:58.520
 Yeah.

00:37:58.520 --> 00:38:00.840
 How far out of your ear before it falls off?

00:38:00.840 --> 00:38:03.480
 On your foot.

00:38:03.480 --> 00:38:06.200
 At the end of the big toe, it falls off.

00:38:06.200 --> 00:38:09.280
 That's why your socks are always full of loose skin.

00:38:09.280 --> 00:38:10.680
 With dots on them.

00:38:10.680 --> 00:38:12.560
 That's right.

00:38:12.560 --> 00:38:15.320
 No, actually, most of it is reabsorbed, actually.

00:38:15.320 --> 00:38:17.560
 I think most earwax is reabsorbed back into the body

00:38:17.560 --> 00:38:19.120
 before it reaches the outside.

00:38:19.120 --> 00:38:21.200
 So I'm confused about this, because obviously,

00:38:21.200 --> 00:38:22.520
 you get earwax in the ears, and this

00:38:22.520 --> 00:38:25.120
 is related to the ear drum.

00:38:25.120 --> 00:38:26.120
 Yes, so--

00:38:26.120 --> 00:38:26.880
 Is it reduced at the ear drum?

00:38:26.880 --> 00:38:27.640
 It waxes.

00:38:27.640 --> 00:38:29.760
 But ear wax is actually mostly dead skin.

00:38:29.760 --> 00:38:30.760
 Yeah.

00:38:30.760 --> 00:38:31.400
 Oh, it is.

00:38:31.400 --> 00:38:31.920
 OK.

00:38:31.920 --> 00:38:33.880
 That's what was confusing me, because yeah,

00:38:33.880 --> 00:38:35.040
 I didn't know what it was made of.

00:38:35.040 --> 00:38:36.720
 So it's got this kind of waxy stuff,

00:38:36.720 --> 00:38:39.240
 but it's basically the big mass of it

00:38:39.240 --> 00:38:41.240
 is bits of dead skin from your ear drum.

00:38:41.240 --> 00:38:44.120
 So it's produced by these glands inside your ear,

00:38:44.120 --> 00:38:46.360
 which I think are in the sort of outer ear.

00:38:46.360 --> 00:38:47.880
 So the dead skin spirals up a bit,

00:38:47.880 --> 00:38:51.520
 and then picks up the sticky substance from these glands.

00:38:51.520 --> 00:38:53.160
 And it's got like fatty acids in it,

00:38:53.160 --> 00:38:55.880
 it's got cholesterol in it, other fats.

00:38:55.880 --> 00:38:57.360
 And it also has alcohol in it.

00:38:57.360 --> 00:39:00.000
 So I really wanted to find out what the exact alcohol content

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:03.360
 of earwax was, and then work out the equivalent of a pine.

00:39:03.360 --> 00:39:04.160
 Yeah, I can't.

00:39:04.160 --> 00:39:05.880
 How much earwax would you have to eat

00:39:05.880 --> 00:39:07.480
 before you went over the legal limit?

00:39:07.480 --> 00:39:08.480
 Yeah.

00:39:08.480 --> 00:39:10.440
 Oh, poor policeman.

00:39:10.440 --> 00:39:12.440
 Who pulls you over?

00:39:12.440 --> 00:39:14.400
 You just got a mouthful of earwax.

00:39:14.400 --> 00:39:15.920
 You know, those medical trial things

00:39:15.920 --> 00:39:18.680
 that people go and do to test things out.

00:39:18.680 --> 00:39:20.800
 Imagine being that the gig you get.

00:39:20.800 --> 00:39:22.200
 How much would they have to pay you

00:39:22.200 --> 00:39:24.960
 to agree to eat enough earwax to get you drunk?

00:39:24.960 --> 00:39:26.960
 Well, we don't know how much it is, you see.

00:39:26.960 --> 00:39:29.960
 For all we know, it's just like one little tiny bit of earwax

00:39:29.960 --> 00:39:31.360
 is enough to put you over the limit.

00:39:31.360 --> 00:39:33.760
 Let's say that's a sharp glass full of earwax.

00:39:33.760 --> 00:39:34.760
 Right.

00:39:34.760 --> 00:39:35.760
 Absolutely.

00:39:35.760 --> 00:39:38.800
 Well, I'll negotiate, but I'll start at 10,000.

00:39:38.800 --> 00:39:39.800
 10,000?

00:39:39.800 --> 00:39:40.600
 Yeah.

00:39:40.600 --> 00:39:41.960
 I'll do it for probably a tenor, come on.

00:39:41.960 --> 00:39:43.120
 What have I got in there?

00:39:43.120 --> 00:39:44.920
 I was going in the other direction.

00:39:45.920 --> 00:39:47.800
 Kale, we've agreed that my one's the one.

00:39:47.800 --> 00:39:48.800
 OK.

00:39:48.800 --> 00:39:50.920
 I think Hannah's currently leading the bed at the moment.

00:39:50.920 --> 00:39:55.800
 I reckon we can crowdfot that 10,000, 10 pounds.

00:39:55.800 --> 00:39:57.040
 And then you can both do it.

00:39:57.040 --> 00:40:03.000
 So Japanese mothers clean out their kids

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:06.960
 is with these earwax, they're called mini khaki.

00:40:06.960 --> 00:40:09.400
 And then when Japanese people grow up,

00:40:09.400 --> 00:40:10.680
 they really like the feeling of it.

00:40:10.680 --> 00:40:12.360
 And so you get ear salons where you go

00:40:12.360 --> 00:40:13.960
 and you pay quite a lot of money to go and have

00:40:13.960 --> 00:40:15.440
 your ears cleaned out, same kind of thing.

00:40:15.440 --> 00:40:17.640
 But the thing about this is, if you start,

00:40:17.640 --> 00:40:19.600
 which all of you would have read, when you start looking up,

00:40:19.600 --> 00:40:22.920
 earwax and ears, there's not a single medical professional

00:40:22.920 --> 00:40:24.480
 worldwide who doesn't say straight away,

00:40:24.480 --> 00:40:26.960
 do not put anything in your ear.

00:40:26.960 --> 00:40:28.320
 It's really, really back to you.

00:40:28.320 --> 00:40:31.040
 Yeah, but then weirdly, we're all putting our fingers in our ears

00:40:31.040 --> 00:40:32.120
 while we're talking about this.

00:40:32.120 --> 00:40:33.800
 Yeah, I mean, you just did it then.

00:40:33.800 --> 00:40:34.800
 I did, didn't I?

00:40:34.800 --> 00:40:38.240
 I put a finger in my ears whenever any of you talk.

00:40:38.240 --> 00:40:40.200
 I wonder if people listening to this are also putting

00:40:40.200 --> 00:40:41.680
 their fingers in their ears.

00:40:41.680 --> 00:40:44.640
 And it's a kind of thing that you just automatically do,

00:40:44.640 --> 00:40:47.440
 like, you know, some kind of social things

00:40:47.440 --> 00:40:51.560
 that are catching, you know, like a yarn kind of thing.

00:40:51.560 --> 00:40:52.320
 Yeah, I bet.

00:40:52.320 --> 00:40:53.520
 I spoke to a doctor once he said,

00:40:53.520 --> 00:40:55.680
 "You should never put anything smaller than a caulge

00:40:55.680 --> 00:40:57.360
 yet in your ear."

00:40:57.360 --> 00:41:00.000
 And the thing was, obviously, you can't fit one of those in,

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:01.840
 but you shouldn't put anything else in.

00:41:01.840 --> 00:41:03.440
 That is exactly the case.

00:41:03.440 --> 00:41:06.720
 That's probably true of most, like, holes in your body.

00:41:06.720 --> 00:41:10.760
 You shouldn't put anything smaller than a caulge, actually.

00:41:10.760 --> 00:41:14.600
 A couple of years ago, they found a cat abandoned in Norfolk,

00:41:14.600 --> 00:41:15.280
 right?

00:41:15.280 --> 00:41:16.680
 Some people found it abandoned cat,

00:41:16.680 --> 00:41:18.680
 and it had three ears.

00:41:18.680 --> 00:41:19.440
 Really?

00:41:19.440 --> 00:41:20.280
 And...

00:41:20.280 --> 00:41:21.480
 Were they all belonging to it?

00:41:21.480 --> 00:41:24.360
 Or had it just eating a mouse, is it?

00:41:24.360 --> 00:41:27.880
 Yeah, this extra ear on its left-hand side

00:41:27.880 --> 00:41:29.080
 in front of its other ear.

00:41:29.080 --> 00:41:31.400
 Can you guess what they consider calling it?

00:41:31.400 --> 00:41:33.840
 Oh, um...

00:41:33.840 --> 00:41:35.120
 It's really good.

00:41:35.120 --> 00:41:36.480
 Okay, ear.

00:41:36.480 --> 00:41:37.800
 Ear, kitty, kitty.

00:41:37.800 --> 00:41:38.800
 That's very good.

00:41:38.800 --> 00:41:39.520
 That's very good.

00:41:39.520 --> 00:41:41.160
 It's ear, kitty, kitty, surely.

00:41:41.160 --> 00:41:42.360
 Make sure, yeah.

00:41:42.360 --> 00:41:44.440
 Well, no, it'd be ear, ear, ear, kitty.

00:41:44.440 --> 00:41:46.360
 (LAUGHTER)

00:41:46.360 --> 00:41:51.000
 Shall I tell you what they called it?

00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:52.440
 And then you'll see, if you can guess why,

00:41:52.440 --> 00:41:55.000
 they thought about calling it Captain Kirk.

00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:56.200
 Okay.

00:41:56.200 --> 00:41:59.160
 Because he had a wild frontier or something.

00:41:59.160 --> 00:42:00.880
 It was an old joke, isn't it?

00:42:00.880 --> 00:42:02.400
 Where did they go in Star Trek?

00:42:02.400 --> 00:42:03.320
 A final frontier.

00:42:03.320 --> 00:42:05.240
 Yes, it's a final frontier.

00:42:05.240 --> 00:42:06.320
 Oh, yeah.

00:42:06.320 --> 00:42:07.960
 And they considered calling it that,

00:42:07.960 --> 00:42:09.440
 and then they called it Brian.

00:42:09.440 --> 00:42:12.040
 (LAUGHTER)

00:42:12.040 --> 00:42:14.360
 After three-aird Brian.

00:42:14.360 --> 00:42:17.160
 Is that the worst outbreak turn of the name?

00:42:17.160 --> 00:42:20.280
 (LAUGHTER)

00:42:20.280 --> 00:42:23.320
 Speaking of cats, in 1968,

00:42:23.320 --> 00:42:26.080
 New York vet Robert A. Lopez wanted to discover

00:42:26.080 --> 00:42:27.920
 whether it was possible for the ear mite

00:42:27.920 --> 00:42:31.760
 which you're getting cats to infest humans.

00:42:31.760 --> 00:42:33.960
 So he removed some mites from a cat's ear,

00:42:33.960 --> 00:42:35.640
 mixed them with his earwax,

00:42:35.640 --> 00:42:39.040
 and then introduced them into his ear.

00:42:39.040 --> 00:42:41.760
 And it turns out they can infest people's ears.

00:42:41.760 --> 00:42:44.240
 (LAUGHTER)

00:42:44.240 --> 00:42:46.080
 Really hoping for a no in this study.

00:42:46.080 --> 00:42:47.560
 Really hoping for a no in this.

00:42:47.560 --> 00:42:48.400
 Wow.

00:42:48.400 --> 00:42:50.800
 So it was extremely painful.

00:42:50.800 --> 00:42:54.840
 You know, it was loads of sounds in his ear all the time.

00:42:54.840 --> 00:42:56.600
 They traveled deeper into his ear drum

00:42:56.600 --> 00:43:00.440
 and they got louder and louder by the third week.

00:43:00.440 --> 00:43:02.040
 He was completely deaf in the ear.

00:43:02.040 --> 00:43:02.840
 Oh, my God.

00:43:02.840 --> 00:43:06.760
 In the fourth week, the mites activity was 75% reduced,

00:43:06.760 --> 00:43:07.600
 which is good.

00:43:07.600 --> 00:43:11.120
 But he could feel the mites crawling across his face at night.

00:43:11.120 --> 00:43:12.680
 Oh.

00:43:12.680 --> 00:43:15.200
 On the inside or the outside?

00:43:15.200 --> 00:43:17.280
 Across the outside of his face,

00:43:17.280 --> 00:43:19.080
 probably trying to find the new ear.

00:43:19.080 --> 00:43:21.080
 (LAUGHTER)

00:43:21.080 --> 00:43:22.080
 Oh, my God.

00:43:22.080 --> 00:43:25.120
 So he finished that and then did the experiment two more times.

00:43:25.120 --> 00:43:26.840
 (LAUGHTER)

00:43:26.840 --> 00:43:28.360
 With his other two ears.

00:43:28.360 --> 00:43:30.760
 (LAUGHTER)

00:43:30.760 --> 00:43:33.040
 And found that the fex diminished,

00:43:33.040 --> 00:43:36.240
 which he said that maybe his body found an immune reaction

00:43:36.240 --> 00:43:37.240
 against the mites.

00:43:37.240 --> 00:43:38.080
 That's good.

00:43:38.080 --> 00:43:40.280
 So there are two ways of avoiding suffering

00:43:40.280 --> 00:43:41.720
 from cat-might infestations.

00:43:41.720 --> 00:43:44.080
 Either infest yourself repeatedly.

00:43:44.080 --> 00:43:45.280
 Or just don't do it in the first place.

00:43:45.280 --> 00:43:47.440
 (LAUGHTER)

00:43:47.440 --> 00:43:49.200
 There was a woman who she had a spider in her ear,

00:43:49.200 --> 00:43:50.200
 didn't she?

00:43:50.200 --> 00:43:51.400
 She had a live tarantula in her ear.

00:43:51.400 --> 00:43:54.480
 No, you're thinking of the nursery rhyme, I think.

00:43:54.480 --> 00:43:55.480
 Yeah.

00:43:55.480 --> 00:43:56.680
 Because it was the fly first.

00:43:56.680 --> 00:44:00.240
 There was no lady who put a fly in her ear.

00:44:00.240 --> 00:44:01.040
 I don't know why.

00:44:01.040 --> 00:44:02.680
 Now she can't hear.

00:44:02.680 --> 00:44:03.920
 No, there was.

00:44:03.920 --> 00:44:06.760
 There was a woman who had a live tarantula removed from her ear.

00:44:06.760 --> 00:44:09.280
 And she inserted the colljettes to get rid of them.

00:44:09.280 --> 00:44:10.880
 (LAUGHTER)

00:44:10.880 --> 00:44:16.800
 OK, that's it.

00:44:16.800 --> 00:44:17.760
 That is all of our facts.

00:44:17.760 --> 00:44:19.120
 Thank you so much for listening.

00:44:19.120 --> 00:44:20.840
 If you'd like to get in contact with any of us

00:44:20.840 --> 00:44:22.720
 about the things that we have said over the course

00:44:22.720 --> 00:44:25.240
 of this podcast, we can be found on our Twitter accounts.

00:44:25.240 --> 00:44:27.200
 I'm on @Streiberland, Andy.

00:44:27.200 --> 00:44:28.920
 @AndreyHunterM.

00:44:28.920 --> 00:44:31.760
 James, @X8, and Anna.

00:44:31.760 --> 00:44:34.000
 You can email a podcast at qi.com.

00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:35.840
 Yep, or you can go to our group account,

00:44:35.840 --> 00:44:38.400
 which is @qipodcast, or go to our website.

00:44:38.400 --> 00:44:40.440
 No such thing as a fish.com.

00:44:40.440 --> 00:44:42.720
 We've got all of our previous episodes up there.

00:44:42.720 --> 00:44:45.360
 We have a link to our tour, which is happening in October

00:44:45.360 --> 00:44:46.040
 in November.

00:44:46.040 --> 00:44:49.200
 And we also have a link to our book, The Book of the Year,

00:44:49.200 --> 00:44:51.320
 which is coming out in November.

00:44:51.320 --> 00:44:52.080
 Check it all out.

00:44:52.080 --> 00:44:54.240
 We'll be back again next week with another episode.

00:44:54.240 --> 00:44:55.200
 We'll see you then.

00:44:55.200 --> 00:44:56.680
 Goodbye.
