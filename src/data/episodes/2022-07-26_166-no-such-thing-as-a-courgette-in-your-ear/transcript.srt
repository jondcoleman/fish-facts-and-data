00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,360
 Hello and welcome to another episode of no such thing as a fish, a weekly podcast coming

3
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:24,480
 to you from the QI offices in Covent Garden.

4
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:28,960
 My name is Dan Shriver, I'm sitting here with Andrew Huntamari.

5
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:34,120
 Anna Chazizki and James Harkin, and once again we have gathered around the microphones

6
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:39,200
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days and in a particular order, here we

7
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,480
 go, starting with you, Andy.

8
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:42,480
 Thank you.

9
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:49,000
 Well that incredibly forgetful introduction.

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,200
 My fact this week is that chicken's eggs turn from pointy end first to the blunt end

11
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:55,960
 first just before they come out.

12
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:57,280
 Like a baby?

13
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:58,280
 Like a baby.

14
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:03,200
 I don't know if babies have a pointy end, but when a baby is getting ready, yeah I guess

15
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,920
 the head is the head.

16
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:08,320
 So when you're getting ready to be born, babies will go into dive position.

17
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:09,320
 Well most babies do.

18
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:10,320
 Most babies.

19
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,600
 I was a breach as was my brother.

20
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:16,900
 So I wonder if chickens have the same thing, where sometimes you get a breach one where

21
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:17,900
 it's...

22
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:18,900
 Or quid eggs.

23
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:19,900
 Or quid eggs, yeah.

24
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:21,480
 And sometimes they have to Susereen it out because it's the pointy end first and it's

25
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:23,160
 just too difficult.

26
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:26,200
 Yeah, which seems counterinduitive, doesn't it?

27
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:31,800
 So why do they come out that end first, once you get past the most rounded bit, it probably

28
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:32,800
 just fires out.

29
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:33,800
 Yeah.

30
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:34,800
 It's exactly like a baby.

31
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:37,840
 That's why it's harder with a baby when they come out next to us because you have to push

32
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,720
 hardest right at the end, don't you?

33
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:44,840
 Babies should come out like, you know, like in the pencil position, like a pencil dive.

34
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:49,240
 Or like a diver the other way around, with the hands in a diving position.

35
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:50,240
 That'd be good.

36
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:55,600
 That's how I imagined Tom Daly was born.

37
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:56,600
 My water's broken.

38
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:59,960
 And there's lots of them.

39
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:02,000
 Judges hold of the date.

40
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,480
 I was talking about Tom Daly the other day.

41
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:08,120
 I have a theory that it might not even be a theory, it might be a fact.

42
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:13,160
 But if you were a diver and you dive off high boards, half of your training must be just

43
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:14,160
 walking upstairs.

44
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,160
 Now it's not a fact.

45
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,360
 No, I think that was a fact.

46
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,360
 What do you mean by training?

47
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:23,960
 Well, because if you're not used to walking upstairs, like Anna and I walked up some stairs

48
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:29,160
 the other day and I almost died, you lose your energy and he's got to now do a dive once

49
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,160
 he's at the top of them.

50
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,160
 Those boards are really high.

51
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:32,160
 That's really steep stairs.

52
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:36,000
 But they are elite sports people, not like you walking up the stairs that cover garden.

53
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,720
 But they must, they must part of their training must be like climb up some stairs.

54
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:40,720
 It must be.

55
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:41,720
 No.

56
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:44,640
 No possible reason why you wouldn't train them to climb stairs all the time.

57
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:49,280
 Actually, then elite divers have chair lifts so they can conserve their energy.

58
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,280
 There we go.

59
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:55,040
 Done, do you understand that if you get fit at one thing, sometimes that means you're fit

60
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,600
 at loads of other things.

61
00:02:56,600 --> 00:03:00,960
 So if I become like a champion runner, I'll also probably find it easy to go upstairs.

62
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:01,960
 I don't disagree with that.

63
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:02,960
 I don't disagree with that.

64
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:03,960
 I don't think that's true.

65
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:04,960
 I think it uses different muscles.

66
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:05,960
 Yeah.

67
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:06,960
 But if you've seen these divers, they're like super fit.

68
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:07,960
 I'm not saying--

69
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:08,960
 They're not like flabby ass.

70
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:12,560
 People try to get up the stairs, are they?

71
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:16,400
 I'm annoyed that I've been bounced into the position now, supposedly saying that divers

72
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,400
 are not fit.

73
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:21,640
 You know, because all those competitions where they take a rest off way out, don't they?

74
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:22,640
 They have a sit down.

75
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:28,760
 Now, if the whole point of diving was to make the biggest splash possible, then you would

76
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:30,920
 have a lot of out-of-shape people climbing up.

77
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:31,920
 Yeah.

78
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:32,920
 And then that would be a problem.

79
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:33,920
 Yes.

80
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:34,920
 But did you mean--

81
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:35,920
 Because they might not make it to the dive.

82
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:36,920
 Well, that would be part of the--

83
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:37,920
 That's part of the competition.

84
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:38,920
 Yeah.

85
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:41,720
 So you have to be big enough to make a massive splash, but not big enough that you can't

86
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:43,720
 get to the top floor.

87
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:45,720
 And that's the two tensions.

88
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:46,720
 Yeah.

89
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:47,720
 I'm starting to think.

90
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:48,720
 You're right.

91
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:49,720
 Yeah.

92
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:50,720
 So hang on.

93
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:53,440
 You're saying that do you mean half a time that divers benched?

94
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:57,560
 I'm just saying I didn't factor in that that's half the gig getting up to the board.

95
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:02,360
 But then I think if you, once it's been a leaked diver, and you spent half of your training

96
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:07,000
 time climbing up and downstairs, and only half of your training time learning how to

97
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
 actually dive, probably--

98
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
 But they must--

99
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
 No, it's right.

100
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
 They must do.

101
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
 How long does it take to get up those stairs?

102
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
 30 seconds.

103
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,600
 But how long do you spend fapping around getting ready for the dive?

104
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,600
 Probably about 30 seconds.

105
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,720
 They're probably catching their breath again.

106
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:25,080
 They're not all-- that's not where all training happens, of course, with divers.

107
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:27,160
 They do a lot in maths and stuff like that.

108
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,760
 It's a lot of gymnastics and stuff like that.

109
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:29,760
 Yeah, I didn't know that.

110
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:30,760
 I see.

111
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:32,760
 You're just saying they spend half their time because to practice--

112
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:33,760
 Yeah.

113
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:34,760
 --you do have to go up the stairs.

114
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:36,760
 We're just down saying they actually need to practice going up the stairs.

115
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:40,760
 If you got there and you don't even have time to complete the first half of your modules,

116
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:51,240
 you just got to the top of the stairs.

117
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:53,480
 Something about the man who discovered this.

118
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:57,920
 The man who discovered-- I'm just a reminder of the fact that chicken's eggs turn from pointy

119
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:00,200
 end first to blunt end first just before they hatch.

120
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:04,880
 He was an egg scientist, he studied birds and bird's eggs.

121
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:10,400
 And he was called Heinrich Wickman, or Wickman, and he found out by marking the eggs with

122
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:15,760
 a pencil, up the birds, just an hour before they laid the eggs.

123
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:19,240
 So he inserted a pencil into the bird's cloaca.

124
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,240
 Wow.

125
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,240
 I know.

126
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:25,520
 Anyway, I got this in a book called The Most Perfect Thing as a book all about birds eggs by

127
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:26,520
 guy called Tim Burkehead.

128
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:27,520
 And I do recommend it.

129
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:28,800
 It's a really interesting book.

130
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:34,160
 An egg shape is-- that specific shape is the most pleasing shape that it could be to

131
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,160
 us.

132
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:38,600
 So they've done some brain tests that look at the kind of surface curvature that humans

133
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,040
 find most pleasing.

134
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:42,360
 And across all societies, it's that exact curvature.

135
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,360
 Wow.

136
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,800
 So if it goes more pointy or more squash, then we don't enjoy looking at it as much.

137
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:52,080
 And I think it's because we've evolved to think that that's what a healthy bit of tissue

138
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,400
 development would look like.

139
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:57,040
 But what's interesting is that different eggs are different sizes for different birds,

140
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,040
 aren't they?

141
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,440
 So is this a chicken egg you're talking about?

142
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:00,440
 Chicken egg, yeah.

143
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:01,440
 Interesting.

144
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:04,040
 But they're often quite-- you do get more rounded eggs, but you don't get, like, really

145
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,040
 long thing.

146
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:11,320
 It's way off, then, because then the bird that was born in them, like maybe a snake's egg would

147
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:12,320
 be like that.

148
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,320
 A stick bird.

149
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:14,320
 A stick bird.

150
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:16,440
 A stick flamingo egg would be like that.

151
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:17,440
 Yeah.

152
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,280
 But you do get round ones.

153
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,280
 You do get round ones.

154
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:21,280
 Yeah.

155
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,280
 Who do round ones?

156
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:23,280
 Some other ones.

157
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,280
 Some other birds, too.

158
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:25,280
 Yeah.

159
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,280
 There was a theory.

160
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:30,280
 I don't think this might not be true anymore, but the idea that the egg shape ones don't really

161
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:32,160
 roll out of nest very well.

162
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:37,320
 The ones which are more rounded are ones that lay eggs on the floor, so they might not fall

163
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:38,320
 out of trees as likely.

164
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:39,320
 Yeah.

165
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:40,520
 Are you going to debunk that theory?

166
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:43,440
 I've read a debunk, but I can't-- I didn't look into it properly.

167
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,360
 There is something in this book about it as well, actually.

168
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,720
 I can't remember chapter and verse.

169
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:47,720
 Yeah.

170
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:51,760
 They could have done, in order to find it out with modern technology, a sort of X-ray

171
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:52,760
 video.

172
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:57,440
 Because do you remember those that incredible photo of what a kiwi bird looks like just

173
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,440
 before it gives birth?

174
00:06:58,440 --> 00:06:59,440
 Yeah.

175
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:00,440
 I used to have that picture on my wall.

176
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:04,000
 It's so-- I don't think we just love the curvature so much.

177
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:09,560
 Well, it's just because you're looking at it going, is this a kiwi with an egg in it, or

178
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:12,280
 is this an egg with a kiwi over it?

179
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:13,280
 It's both.

180
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,280
 It's really.

181
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:15,280
 It's both.

182
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,280
 They're both the same size.

183
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:17,280
 Are you inside your clothes?

184
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,280
 Are they outside of you?

185
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,280
 I think this James is both.

186
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,280
 Is it?

187
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:23,280
 Yeah.

188
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,280
 Why am I mind that?

189
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:27,760
 The equivalent-- if a kiwi bird, when you see this picture, and I highly recommend Google

190
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:28,760
 this picture--

191
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,320
 Yeah, I'll put it on my Twitter.

192
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:32,040
 I'll put on a kiwi podcast as well.

193
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:34,840
 It's equivalent to a human giving birth to a four-year-old.

194
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:35,840
 Oh.

195
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:36,840
 Oh.

196
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:37,840
 That's how big the egg is.

197
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,840
 And they're all wearing jumpers and things.

198
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:43,440
 That would be especially scratchy and difficult.

199
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,440
 Leggo.

200
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:45,440
 Leggo.

201
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,440
 Jumping into your whole way out.

202
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:52,720
 Did you know that mammals evolved milk in order to wet their eggs?

203
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:53,720
 What?

204
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:54,720
 I don't even understand that.

205
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:55,720
 Yeah.

206
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:56,720
 I know.

207
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:57,720
 Like cooked chicken eggs?

208
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:58,920
 For it.

209
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:02,160
 Not-- we didn't-- we didn't evolve milk

210
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,680
 so we could poach a good egg in here.

211
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,680
 [LAUGHTER]

212
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:06,680
 What's the egg?

213
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:07,680
 What eggs?

214
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:13,760
 So millions of years ago, when our ancestors were still laying eggs, they didn't have shells.

215
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:16,400
 So they had, like, quite a porous membrane.

216
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:19,120
 And that meant that they would dry out really easily.

217
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:24,440
 And so we evolved milk, people think, now, in order to, like, put it over the eggs.

218
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:25,440
 What?

219
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:28,120
 Make sure that they didn't get dehydrated.

220
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:33,400
 And then we realized-- evolution realized-- that quite a good use of this milk would be as

221
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:38,080
 a way of transferring some nutrients into the offspring in our egg.

222
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:41,440
 And so we developed more and more nutrients in our milk, and then kept putting that in the

223
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,440
 egg.

224
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:46,480
 And then eventually, that our milk became so nutrient-filled that it became just something

225
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,760
 we could nurture a baby with.

226
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:50,760
 That is cool.

227
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:51,760
 Wow.

228
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:56,880
 I was reading that you can know what color an egg is going to be from a chicken by looking

229
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:57,880
 at its ears.

230
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:00,680
 Chicken's done of external ears, do they?

231
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:01,680
 They have earlobes.

232
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:02,680
 Have earlobes?

233
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:03,680
 Do they?

234
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:04,680
 Yeah.

235
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:05,680
 Prominent.

236
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:06,680
 You've seen them.

237
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:08,680
 I think maybe you just didn't think of them as being earlobes.

238
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:09,680
 Yeah.

239
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:13,160
 So if they have white earlobes, they'll have white eggs.

240
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:16,600
 And if they have red earlobes, they'll have brown eggs.

241
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:20,000
 This, the article stresses, is not always the case.

242
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
 Right.

243
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
 OK.

244
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,120
 But they do say that it's something that people have noticed more often than not.

245
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,520
 It's almost always the case, I think.

246
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:30,320
 You can tell it's going to be a color similar to the earlobes.

247
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:33,880
 Are you, Andy, as imagining a chicken with human ears?

248
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:34,880
 Yeah.

249
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:35,880
 Yeah.

250
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:36,880
 And it's disgusting.

251
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:37,880
 Yeah.

252
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:38,880
 You ever seen a chicken?

253
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:39,880
 Do you know what a chicken is?

254
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:40,880
 Yeah.

255
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:41,880
 OK.

256
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:42,880
 Yeah.

257
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:43,880
 I just was, because this is your fact.

258
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:47,120
 So I was just checking you had Google chicken before you came in here.

259
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,120
 Yeah.

260
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:50,960
 I think it's not the first thing you see when you look at a chicken, though, is it?

261
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:54,000
 You see the feathers and you see the beak.

262
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,520
 It's not the initial--

263
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:58,880
 And sometimes the little feathery trousers, you know, the little spurs they have.

264
00:09:58,880 --> 00:09:59,880
 Those are pretty cute.

265
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:00,880
 Oh, yeah.

266
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,360
 Those were the big cowboys told.

267
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:05,760
 But it's not like elephants were the first thing you see as there is.

268
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:06,760
 Yeah.

269
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:09,400
 The first thing you see on an elephant is the trunks, James.

270
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,400
 Well, I'm looking for the side.

271
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,400
 Yeah.

272
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:14,400
 It's facing away from you.

273
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,360
 I can't catch a slay.

274
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:21,600
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

275
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,400
 OK, it is time to move on to fact number two.

276
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,240
 And that is James.

277
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:30,000
 OK, my fact this week is that the former prime minister of Georgia

278
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,240
 has started taking famous trees from around his country, digging them up,

279
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:37,840
 and then planting them in his own garden.

280
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:39,720
 He's like, he's personally digging them up.

281
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:40,560
 He's digging them up.

282
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:41,560
 It's amazing.

283
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:45,240
 So I was re-- so for our book, which is coming out in November,

284
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:47,800
 I was reading about the world geopolitical situation.

285
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,680
 And there's things happening in Georgia.

286
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:52,800
 There's elections in Abkhazia where they're trying to get out of Georgia.

287
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,120
 And while I was reading that, I came across this guy.

288
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:57,520
 And I can't believe I've never heard about him before.

289
00:10:57,520 --> 00:11:01,840
 He's called Bidzina Ivanishvili, and he's taking trees from around the country,

290
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:04,120
 and I've had driving them or putting them on a ship,

291
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:06,920
 and then taking them to his house and planting them.

292
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:08,440
 And he says, it's my hobby.

293
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:10,200
 I really love big trees.

294
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:13,160
 Giant trees are my entertainments.

295
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:16,040
 How many famous trees are there in Georgia?

296
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:17,080
 And not as many as they used to be.

297
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:17,920
 Ah.

298
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:20,120
 [LAUGHTER]

299
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:21,000
 So this is the thing.

300
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,120
 He reckons that it's a good idea, because before the people who have the trees on their land

301
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,680
 might not have been properly looking after them.

302
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:31,160
 And so if he puts them on his land, then he'll be able to look after them on his arboretum.

303
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:33,200
 But ecologists are skeptical.

304
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:37,640
 Well, it does say, doesn't he, though, that he'll plant 10 trees for everyone that he takes away?

305
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:39,400
 Or I think at least he did that for one of them.

306
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:41,320
 He did that for this giant tulip tree.

307
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:43,840
 It was a 650-ton tulip tree.

308
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:44,840
 Whoa.

309
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:47,160
 I thought tulips were like small.

310
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:49,480
 Yeah, I thought they were as well.

311
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:52,040
 I guess this is just one 650-ton tulip.

312
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:53,960
 Yeah, well, you know his context, actually.

313
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:55,200
 It's all in the way the photo's done.

314
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,560
 So you know those fields of tulips you see in the Netherlands.

315
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:58,920
 Those are actually all massive.

316
00:11:58,920 --> 00:11:59,920
 [LAUGHTER]

317
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,400
 Well, you do see the upwind mill, though.

318
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:03,800
 So maybe Dutch windmills are absolutely massive.

319
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:04,600
 They're even bigger.

320
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:05,400
 I bet.

321
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:06,720
 Maybe he's just chuping them all.

322
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,360
 Maybe he's told them it's a tulip tree.

323
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:10,760
 So he's like, oh, I'll just give you these extra tulip seeds.

324
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:13,800
 You could have 10 of them, cab as well as you want.

325
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,400
 This guy, he does sound amazing, though.

326
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:16,560
 He is incredible.

327
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,680
 And he's got this mansion, hasn't he, which

328
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:20,880
 is kind of disgusting, if you look it up.

329
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:24,120
 And it's basically, it is the James Bond mansion.

330
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:26,280
 It's like a giant glass spaceship.

331
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:27,080
 Yeah.

332
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:29,120
 And it's on a mountain side, isn't it?

333
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:31,120
 So it overlooks the capital of his country

334
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,320
 from a mountain side.

335
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,160
 Yeah.

336
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:35,000
 So the indie went and interviewed him.

337
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,280
 And when he went there, he said,

338
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:42,400
 there are eight different breeds of peacock and I have them all.

339
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:46,280
 So he really likes collecting loads of stuff, basically.

340
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:47,920
 Yeah, he has loads of animals, doesn't he?

341
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:51,600
 He has zebras, what else do you see?

342
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,320
 Kangaroos.

343
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,720
 Kangaroos, penguins.

344
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:56,640
 He is also rumored to have a shark tank.

345
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:58,080
 He does, yeah.

346
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:00,680
 Yeah, he does because he has to keep importing loads of salt

347
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:03,120
 for it all the time, I think, like gallons of salt.

348
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,760
 Apparently, in the whole way of his house,

349
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:07,680
 he has a work by Gilbert and George with a slogan that says,

350
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:10,320
 "Say fuck off to rich bastards."

351
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:13,800
 His net worth is $4.8 billion.

352
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:17,760
 Yeah, I think his net worth is like 50% of the GDP of Georgia,

353
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:18,600
 doesn't it?

354
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:19,120
 No, no.

355
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:21,280
 It's between a third and a half, depending on which source you read.

356
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:22,920
 But it is, yeah.

357
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:25,040
 Well, he sounds like the right man to be the former leader

358
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,040
 of the country, doesn't he?

359
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:26,560
 Yeah.

360
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,320
 If he is, basically, the GDP of Georgia.

361
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:28,960
 Well, indeed.

362
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:30,080
 Yeah, that's true.

363
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:32,560
 And just quickly, on trees in Georgia,

364
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,000
 I don't think I'm going to get another chance

365
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,840
 to get my trees in Georgia factor out of this.

366
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:36,840
 Well, that's what I have next week.

367
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:37,440
 Yeah, it's possible.

368
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:38,840
 You could put it in the book.

369
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:39,840
 Oh, yeah.

370
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:43,040
 Well, just in case I don't do that.

371
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:45,840
 So basically, Georgia breed Christmas trees.

372
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:48,320
 And you know the tree that we call the nordman fur

373
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,520
 and it gets called the Caucasian fur.

374
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:52,360
 It's basically the famous Christmas tree in Europe,

375
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:56,600
 as in 45 million gets sold all around Western Europe each year.

376
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:59,760
 These trees are grown elsewhere,

377
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,440
 but they're originally from Georgia,

378
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:05,040
 as in the seeds that grow them, or from Georgian Christmas trees.

379
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,960
 And people in Georgia climb up them

380
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:07,960
 and they're massive.

381
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,040
 OK, so it's quite dangerous.

382
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,440
 There are fatalities every year.

383
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:13,200
 They collect the cones, which have got the seeds inside them,

384
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,400
 and then they sell the seeds to places like Denmark.

385
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:17,520
 And then Denmark actually does the work of growing

386
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:18,280
 and selling the trees.

387
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:20,720
 But Georgia misses out, because obviously,

388
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,160
 you need loads and loads of pine cones.

389
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,440
 And then they get sold for much more.

390
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:26,000
 It's like drugs, you know, it starts off quite cheap.

391
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,920
 But the street value of these trees is massive.

392
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:31,240
 So the Georgians, I think, they want to break into that

393
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:32,320
 and start growing their own trees.

394
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,720
 Say no to pinecons, kids.

395
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:35,200
 Yeah.

396
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:37,680
 Hey, while we're just on Christmas trees,

397
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:42,800
 did you guys know that elephants floss using Christmas trees?

398
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:43,800
 Mm.

399
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:44,560
 Have you guys heard that?

400
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:45,080
 No.

401
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:46,280
 I don't think that's true.

402
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:47,280
 It's true.

403
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:47,800
 It's true.

404
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:49,920
 Elephants floss using Christmas trees.

405
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,200
 At least that's what I read.

406
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:53,320
 In Germany, they've got this tradition every year.

407
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:56,640
 So they give their Christmas trees to the elephants at the zoo.

408
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:58,440
 And people just hand over their trees.

409
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,600
 And the elephants eat them.

410
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,680
 They can get through like three trees a day.

411
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,560
 But they also have been seen flossing with them.

412
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:06,480
 So I guess flossing the tree out of their teeth.

413
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,520
 But holding it with their trunk and then in and out

414
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:09,840
 between their teeth.

415
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:11,560
 Yeah, I mean, I haven't seen any pictures myself.

416
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:14,080
 They must be because they don't have opposable thumbs today.

417
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,280
 So it must be with their trunk.

418
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:17,200
 That's the only prehand style part of their body.

419
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:17,720
 Yeah.

420
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:20,360
 But it's weird that you would try and get a tree out with a tree.

421
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:22,120
 And how would it not be?

422
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:23,800
 Would it not be that that tree would get stuck?

423
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:24,320
 Oh, yeah.

424
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,880
 Then you get a slightly larger tree.

425
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:29,520
 It's the elephant version of the old woman who swallowed a fly.

426
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:31,040
 It's the elephant who flossed with a Christmas tree.

427
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,560
 Yeah.

428
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,840
 Eventually has to swallow a tulip tree, which

429
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:37,280
 is the biggest on Earth, apparently.

430
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:39,840
 Speaking of trees, by the way, very quickly, we have just

431
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:41,800
 discovered that there were more trees on Earth

432
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:43,520
 than we thought there were.

433
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:47,520
 So there are now 427 million hectares more

434
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:49,560
 trees than we thought there were on Earth.

435
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:51,360
 How many did I think there were?

436
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:55,280
 427 million hectares less than the number you've got in your head.

437
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:55,800
 Yeah.

438
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:58,360
 So minus that from whatever you've had

439
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:00,040
 to put it into context, by the way.

440
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:04,840
 That is, if all that tree, the new tree was put into a place,

441
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:09,120
 a single place, it would take up 60% of the surface of Australia.

442
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:11,360
 That's actually kind of less than I thought it would be.

443
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:11,880
 Yeah.

444
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:15,040
 But no, is that only the bonus trees that we've got?

445
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,280
 It's not all the trees in the world, is it?

446
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:16,640
 Yeah, yeah.

447
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:19,440
 That's the extra bonus trees.

448
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:22,320
 So we can't just go nuts and start cutting down all the trees.

449
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,600
 Because we're the prime minister of Georgia.

450
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:25,840
 Well, the ex prime minister of Georgia.

451
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:28,600
 What it does mean is that he's got a lot more to collect now.

452
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:30,480
 But he's not collecting every tree.

453
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,680
 He's just collecting individual examples.

454
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:34,320
 Is he collecting all the trees in the world?

455
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,440
 That is the famous tree.

456
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,440
 Oh, we don't know, do we?

457
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:38,280
 Because we only know where he's got to sell far.

458
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:39,280
 We don't know where he's going to start.

459
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:40,960
 Because maybe he's starting with the most famous.

460
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:43,920
 But his list includes every single tree on the planet.

461
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,200
 And he's just working his way down.

462
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,240
 That's the least famous tree.

463
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,000
 Exactly, yeah.

464
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,760
 What is the least famous tree?

465
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:49,440
 Nobody knows.

466
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,200
 That was the thing.

467
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:54,040
 Well, only he knows, and his mother.

468
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:56,880
 Did I ever tell you guys that my dad--

469
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,800
 so I used to live when I was born in Hong Kong.

470
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,760
 We lived in an island just off Hong Kong called Discovery Bay.

471
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:03,240
 And my parents lived in this house.

472
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:05,320
 And next door to them, their neighbor

473
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:06,840
 had a tree in their front yard.

474
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:08,680
 And my dad used to love this tree.

475
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:10,800
 He just used to think, I want one day to have a tree

476
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,440
 in my front yard as well.

477
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:13,880
 And so he went out.

478
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:15,680
 He got really drunk one night.

479
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:17,160
 And he came back.

480
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:19,200
 And he doesn't really remember what happened.

481
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:21,840
 But in the morning, my mom went outside, opened the doors,

482
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:25,120
 and went, Roger, what have you done?

483
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:27,680
 And he quickly jumped up, and he saw what he must have done

484
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:30,200
 in his drug and state, which is clearly he was walking home.

485
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:33,560
 He saw the tree, thought, god damn it, I want that tree.

486
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:36,680
 So he dug it up, and he brought the tree over,

487
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:39,080
 and he planted it in our front yard.

488
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:39,600
 No way.

489
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:43,120
 But what he had failed to do was to cover up his tracks.

490
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:46,480
 So he saw the tree planted beautifully in our yard

491
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,880
 with a huge trail of debris and dirt

492
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:53,240
 leading to a gigantic hole sitting in our neighbor's front yard.

493
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:54,440
 Amazing.

494
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:56,720
 Do you know what I think, actually, even without that trail

495
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,280
 of earth, your neighbor might have just

496
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:00,680
 about figured out when we're going on there?

497
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:01,480
 I know.

498
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:03,680
 I know that swing.

499
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:07,520
 You're saying that your dad, when drunk, on his way home,

500
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:11,000
 dug up a tree, presumably he was just on his way home,

501
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,960
 so he wasn't carrying his spade with him.

502
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:15,640
 So the implication is, he dug it up with his bare hands.

503
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:18,480
 Also, I can only imagine Dan's dad likes trees

504
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,760
 that are tree size, so it must be pretty big, right?

505
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:23,560
 So he dug out this tree, all he thought of that tree

506
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:25,960
 went home, got the spade.

507
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:28,800
 Well, home was just next door, so it was very convenient.

508
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:33,320
 He could have dug it up with a cart, and he got his cababin.

509
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:34,080
 Yes.

510
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:34,600
 You're right.

511
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:37,040
 It was in Australia, Hong Kong, sorry.

512
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:41,320
 Hong Kong, all cabab cartons are made of reinforced steel

513
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:43,240
 in case of burning your hands.

514
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:44,400
 By the way, he put the tree back,

515
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:47,320
 so no one needs suppressed criminal charges or anything.

516
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:49,200
 I don't know if the guy ever noticed, by the way.

517
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,320
 My mom woke up really early in the morning,

518
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:52,760
 unless he was a very late riser.

519
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:54,800
 I think he probably noticed.

520
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,800
 So your dad may be replanted it before this guy woke up?

521
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:58,640
 Yes, I have.

522
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:01,320
 He may be wake-up, he's like, this is orientated.

523
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:03,800
 Just slightly different.

524
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:06,280
 That swing was on the other side.

525
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:09,760
 That poor guy is a mental help from the rest of his life.

526
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,680
 Just had a nervous breakdown.

527
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:13,320
 He actually invented the character of Groot

528
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:17,480
 for the Guardians of the Galaxy film about a mischievous tree.

529
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:20,000
 Just quickly, while we're talking about moving trees,

530
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,400
 whether illegally or legally or with a polystyrene carton,

531
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,080
 if you don't have a polystyrene carton down,

532
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:27,880
 you can get these unbelievably cool things,

533
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:29,880
 and they're called tree spades.

534
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:32,080
 So they're these massive boxes, right?

535
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:34,960
 They look like a big space egg.

536
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,600
 And you surround the tree with it.

537
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:38,960
 I don't know quite where you uncouple it

538
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:39,920
 and surround the tree.

539
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:43,800
 And then what it does is it has these massive round-edged blades

540
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:46,880
 which dig into the ground, very carefully lift up

541
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:49,200
 the entire tree, roots and everything.

542
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,000
 And then they can tilt it sideways

543
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,760
 and put it onto, for example, the side of a van or whatever.

544
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:55,760
 That's so cool.

545
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,840
 Or probably on the back of a van, not the side of a van.

546
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,040
 Yeah, yeah.

547
00:19:59,040 --> 00:19:59,640
 That's amazing.

548
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:02,120
 That sounds like it's given it a pot.

549
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:03,720
 Like it's the egg shape underneath.

550
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:05,800
 It's just created the pot for a standard.

551
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:07,440
 And the really cool thing is they've been doing this

552
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:10,360
 for hundreds of years, or at least, I think, 150 years,

553
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:11,640
 as they were doing this in Brooklyn,

554
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:13,200
 but just without the big mechanical element.

555
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,680
 But they still had these cool devices, too.

556
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:18,640
 So without the mechanical element, it's just a spade.

557
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:21,480
 Well, yeah, they have spades.

558
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:22,840
 They have spades, the other spades.

559
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:24,400
 The spades goes back 150 years.

560
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,640
 Not a lot of people know that.

561
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:27,480
 No, they have these big tree-moving wagons.

562
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:28,520
 Oh, right.

563
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:29,040
 Yeah.

564
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:31,680
 So they put them onto the wagon sideways, do they?

565
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:32,680
 Yeah.

566
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:35,080
 The Prime Minister of George, or the ex-Prime Minister of George,

567
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:35,840
 it didn't do that.

568
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:38,600
 He sent his sticking upwards.

569
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:39,120
 No.

570
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:41,280
 Yeah, so there's some amazing pictures online.

571
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:43,480
 I'll try and put them on my Twitter.

572
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:47,080
 There's one where he has a tree on a kind of a raft.

573
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:50,120
 And he's taking it on the black sea, and it's just sticking up.

574
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:51,120
 That's the way it is.

575
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:52,320
 They look incredible.

576
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:53,200
 You should look at the pictures.

577
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:53,720
 Incredible.

578
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:55,200
 If you took it from someone's land,

579
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,280
 you wouldn't necessarily know he was stealing it.

580
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:59,600
 It just might look like, oh, it looks a bit further away today.

581
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,680
 I'm sure you'll have it.

582
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:02,200
 Exactly.

583
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:04,640
 So then he took them along the coastline of the black sea,

584
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:07,280
 but the coastline of the black sea is really shallow.

585
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:08,840
 And so he got stuck there.

586
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:13,720
 And so he then had to make a new road to take a trail on.

587
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:15,640
 And then that road collapsed.

588
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:17,280
 So he had to make a new road.

589
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:20,760
 And also, one time he took a tree on the highway,

590
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:22,240
 and it was a magnolia tree.

591
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:25,240
 And when he was taking it, it got stuck on a eucalyptus tree

592
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:27,800
 that was growing on the side of the road, so it's kind of angled.

593
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:29,920
 Did it take the eucalyptus tree with it?

594
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:31,240
 Was it just like a tree chain?

595
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:34,280
 I don't buy one, get one tree.

596
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:35,480
 He's a hell of a lot of hassle.

597
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:37,000
 There's a whole bit of it, isn't it?

598
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,200
 Yeah, his wife's probably saying

599
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:40,480
 you need to collect something smaller.

600
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,160
 Or maybe he's just getting drunk every night

601
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:44,360
 and finding these trees in his garden every night.

602
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:46,080
 [LAUGHTER]

603
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:49,200
 Just because you mentioned Christmas trees earlier,

604
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,720
 I was reading this amazing story about the Christmas tree

605
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:53,960
 shipping industry, which used to be huge in the US.

606
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:56,640
 They used to ship hundreds of Christmas trees on ships.

607
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:00,320
 And there was this particular famous ship called the Rouse Simmon Ship.

608
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:03,320
 And it used to carry thousands of trees.

609
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:08,080
 And then in 1912, it had this very famous accident, and it sank.

610
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:11,800
 So it was carrying 5,500 trees from Michigan to Chicago,

611
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:13,080
 across Lake Michigan.

612
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:14,960
 And it was captain by this guy called Sherman,

613
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:17,920
 who was so famous as a Christmas tree importer

614
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:20,080
 that people called him Captain Santa.

615
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:23,720
 And he used to go-- he used to land in Chicago.

616
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:25,800
 And he really liked giving out Christmas trees to the poor

617
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:27,200
 and people who couldn't afford Christmas.

618
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:27,960
 What do you know?

619
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:30,160
 It doesn't quite make sense, because Santa arrives

620
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:32,240
 after the tree has been sorted out.

621
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,960
 Basically, Santa doesn't bring the tree down the chimney.

622
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:37,200
 Maybe Captain Santa comes and sorts that out.

623
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,240
 Santa's like Santa's boss, isn't it?

624
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:42,920
 Santa just left ten and Santa is his full size.

625
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:44,360
 They should give him his full title.

626
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:47,000
 It's very confusing and that's so cool.

627
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,760
 So Captain Santa used to do this.

628
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:52,200
 And then there was this awful, there's a storm that sunk the whole ship

629
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:55,280
 and it killed everyone on board and all the trees sunk.

630
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:57,800
 So for years, afterwards, fishermen on Lake Michigan

631
00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:02,120
 would catch huge Christmas tree catch.

632
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:05,160
 What I quite like is, first of all, his business partner,

633
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:06,640
 who would always wait in Chicago with him,

634
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:10,040
 was called Claude Winters, quite nice numbers of determinism.

635
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:12,760
 Wow, yeah, and also Captain Santa Claude Winters.

636
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:15,640
 It's one letter away from Santa Claude's Winters.

637
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:16,880
 Yes, yeah.

638
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:17,840
 OK.

639
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:21,440
 Anyway, just the other bizarre thing about this accident

640
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:24,680
 was that the Captain Santa left a message in a bottle

641
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:26,160
 when he knew the ship was in trouble.

642
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:29,840
 And he corked it using the small piece of a cut pine tree

643
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:31,560
 from one of the trees that was on board.

644
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:33,640
 And he left this message and it got picked up.

645
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:36,280
 And the message just said, everybody, goodbye.

646
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:40,640
 I guess we are all through leaking bad God help us.

647
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:44,320
 Leaking bad, that sounds like a new Netflix show, doesn't it?

648
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:45,200
 It's about the White House.

649
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:55,520
 OK, it is time for fact number three.

650
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:56,920
 And that is my fact.

651
00:23:56,920 --> 00:24:00,280
 My fact this week is that US military medics

652
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:03,680
 use longer needles than normal because soldiers

653
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:06,840
 are often too buff for the regular ones.

654
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:09,760
 I think this sounds like a boast by the American army.

655
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:11,320
 Yeah, it does, doesn't it?

656
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:13,480
 Yeah, you should see the size of our condoms.

657
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:16,120
 It's just a bit too convenient.

658
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:18,080
 And it's a common thing, isn't it, in armies,

659
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:21,120
 that they send like enormous condoms.

660
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,360
 We saw Jimmy Carter the other day,

661
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:24,600
 and he told us that story about Churchill.

662
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:25,120
 Oh, yeah.

663
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:29,400
 There was a gun where they had a sheath kind of thing put over it.

664
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:30,960
 And it was made by Jurex.

665
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:34,120
 And so it was like a condom, but it was the size of a machine gun.

666
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:36,680
 It was the stop the gun jamming or freezing.

667
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:37,840
 Yeah, that's right.

668
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:41,000
 And so what they did was they got a big consignment of them.

669
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,120
 And then Churchill supposedly said, well, let's label it

670
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:45,440
 to British condoms small.

671
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:49,880
 So let me give you a bit of background of where

672
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:50,920
 I got this fact from.

673
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:54,240
 I'm reading a really good book called Grunt by Mary Roach.

674
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:56,960
 And she went round looking at all innovations

675
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:00,600
 going on in the military and classic Mary Roach investigation

676
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:03,440
 finding out very much what we love, you know,

677
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:05,280
 the quirky facts about certain things.

678
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,480
 So this book's military.

679
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,080
 And she spent time with a bunch of medics.

680
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:12,840
 And this was told to her that basically a lot of the soldiers

681
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:16,560
 are so muscular, particularly around the pecs.

682
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:18,720
 And they often need to give them injections

683
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,680
 when they're out in the field for collapse lungs.

684
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:23,520
 And they were finding in autopsy's when they were doing it

685
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:27,680
 later because in autopsy's, they all get an autopsy.

686
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:29,560
 Any soldier that dies gets an autopsy

687
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:31,600
 when they were going to check out the collapse lung

688
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:33,520
 and putting the needles in, none of them were reaching.

689
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:35,920
 And they thought, this is no use for the field.

690
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:38,280
 So needles, I don't know if it's all the needles,

691
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:39,880
 but certainly there's a lot of needles

692
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:41,920
 that are extra-large long needles.

693
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:42,720
 That's amazing.

694
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:43,520
 Yeah.

695
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:46,000
 They also have to make bigger needles for obese people,

696
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:46,800
 I think.

697
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:47,960
 Do they, right?

698
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:51,160
 They did a study with some obese people.

699
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:54,800
 They put the needles into their buttocks

700
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:57,640
 to see if the stuff would get to the muscles.

701
00:25:57,640 --> 00:26:00,560
 And they found that, in less than a third of the patients,

702
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:03,680
 what they injected was getting through to where it needed to be.

703
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:06,560
 So they need to start making needles, which are now longer

704
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:07,840
 for obese people as well.

705
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:09,920
 Terrible if you've got a fear of needles.

706
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:10,440
 Yeah.

707
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:13,160
 Although, so a good way of combating a fear of needles

708
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:14,520
 has just been developed.

709
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:18,280
 It's never have any Western medicine.

710
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:19,520
 Because if you get acupuncture,

711
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:22,080
 you've really gone through to that.

712
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,760
 No, if you've got a fear of needles,

713
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:25,120
 scientists have developed this thing, which

714
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:27,600
 is a pill that's covered in needles that you swallow

715
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,360
 and that injects you from the inside.

716
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:29,880
 What?

717
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:30,760
 And that has to get you over it.

718
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:31,680
 And this is really cool.

719
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:33,880
 So I think this has been tested.

720
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:35,760
 It was tested on pigs the last time I read about it,

721
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:36,880
 but it might have been updated.

722
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,880
 And it was to administer insulin.

723
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:40,680
 And basically, it's these little pills

724
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:42,360
 and they cover them in tiny needles.

725
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:44,520
 And then they have an outer coating of the pill.

726
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:46,440
 And when the pill gets into your stomach,

727
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:48,400
 then the outer coating of the pill dissolves.

728
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:51,400
 And all these tiny needles prod the lining of your stomach.

729
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:53,440
 And they administer the drug straight into your bloodstream.

730
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:57,160
 But do you have to pass the needles out later on?

731
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:57,680
 I think so.

732
00:26:57,680 --> 00:27:00,640
 But we're talking, like, one millimeter, less than a millimeter.

733
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:01,240
 I don't know.

734
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:03,280
 That still sounds painful.

735
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:05,440
 Maybe they dissolve.

736
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:06,560
 Maybe they do dissolve.

737
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:08,280
 Yeah, they're really tiny.

738
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:10,880
 Well, here-- OK, here's a less painful one

739
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:14,480
 if you don't want to swallow needles.

740
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:16,120
 This is-- this is used.

741
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:18,680
 I don't know if it's-- if it was-- this is just the trial I

742
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:20,480
 was reading about, but they definitely have developed this.

743
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:22,120
 And it has been used.

744
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:23,840
 So instead of having a morphine needle,

745
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:27,560
 let's say, in order to numb you, you can, instead, now,

746
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:28,680
 have a lollipop.

747
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:30,560
 Wow, sticking it into your--

748
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:33,040
 No, yeah, that sounds like it'd be more painful

749
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:34,920
 than it would be in many ways.

750
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:38,000
 I would rather have morphine if I were in pain than a lollipop.

751
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,880
 Well, actually, on any day of the week,

752
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:41,360
 I'd rather have morphine than a lollipop.

753
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:42,800
 Interesting, it's okay.

754
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:45,840
 It's not your classic lollipop, obviously.

755
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:49,760
 It's-- they call it the fentanyl lollipop.

756
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:51,760
 And it's basically the drug.

757
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:53,120
 So it's got a drug in the lollipop.

758
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:56,360
 You eat it, and it absorbs through the tongue and the mouth.

759
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:58,080
 And that's really fast, apparently.

760
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:00,280
 So it spreads really quickly.

761
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:02,600
 And they can also tell when you've had too much.

762
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:03,480
 So because you're sucking--

763
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:05,480
 Because you're going, then, then, then, then, then, then.

764
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:06,320
 Exactly.

765
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:07,720
 Because if it does go into--

766
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:10,000
 it's a painkiller, it first goes into your tongue.

767
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,880
 It's going to be like at the dentist, isn't it, where

768
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:12,480
 you can't talk?

769
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:13,320
 Yes, exactly.

770
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:15,480
 It must numb your tongue.

771
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:18,200
 But they can, obviously, if they see that enough of the drug

772
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:19,560
 has been put into the patient, they

773
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:22,680
 can stop putting more by simply just taking the lollipop away.

774
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:23,440
 Yeah, that one.

775
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:26,560
 And then you're just going to be crying.

776
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:29,120
 Because there was an art installation once

777
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:32,240
 of a guy who gave babies lollipops

778
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:35,080
 and then took them off them and took photos of them crying.

779
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:36,120
 Oh, yeah.

780
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:37,280
 That's quite controversial.

781
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:40,080
 Well, unsurprisingly.

782
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:41,320
 Oh, surprisingly.

783
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:43,520
 Have you had one of these lollipops?

784
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:45,840
 Yeah.

785
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:49,360
 Do you know where the word syringe comes from?

786
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:55,560
 Syring's is a thing in a bird, which makes it like a larynx.

787
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:56,760
 Is it from that?

788
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:58,000
 It is from the word syring's.

789
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,240
 But I didn't know that bird thing.

790
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:02,000
 Because syring's was in Greek mythology.

791
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,800
 She was-- no, he-- look, she--

792
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:07,000
 Syring's-- she was a name.

793
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,440
 And she was being chased by the god Pan, right?

794
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:13,040
 And then she disguised herself as some water reads.

795
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:15,760
 OK, clever, but not clever enough.

796
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:18,040
 Because Pan then chopped the reads off

797
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:20,800
 and blew into them to make a whistling sound.

798
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:23,160
 And that's where he got his pan pipes.

799
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:26,680
 But it's also where the word syringe was taken from.

800
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:28,760
 Because you know, it's a long thing tube of something.

801
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:31,560
 That must be where the syring's of or a syring

802
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:34,440
 so the bird comes from because it's the whistling sound.

803
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:36,680
 And that's what they used to make their tweets.

804
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:38,680
 There we go.

805
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:40,520
 I have some things on mussels.

806
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:41,920
 Oh, cool, yeah.

807
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:46,240
 So there's a guy called Zhang Jingquan in China

808
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:50,280
 who holds a world record for pulling the largest vehicle

809
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:53,760
 by pressing a rice bowl onto his abdominal mussels,

810
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:56,520
 creating a suction, and then attaching it to a vehicle

811
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:57,640
 and pulling it.

812
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:58,920
 How large was the vehicle?

813
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:03,040
 It was 3,305.5 kilograms.

814
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:05,920
 And he pulled it for 10 meters.

815
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:07,280
 Wow.

816
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:09,440
 Just through suction, that adhered.

817
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:11,680
 It adhered to his muscular abdomen.

818
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:13,360
 I would have thought that they would always,

819
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:16,360
 because you're not flat enough to be able to put the suction

820
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:17,360
 on the floor.

821
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:18,720
 I'm Zhang Jingquan's.

822
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,000
 I'm really impressed by that.

823
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,000
 That's incredible.

824
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,080
 I think he did it to impress people.

825
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:23,600
 Did it--

826
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:25,120
 It's worked like a trial.

827
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:27,560
 It's half worked, I'd say, Anna.

828
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:28,600
 And then it's worked on you.

829
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:29,360
 I'm not impressed.

830
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:30,320
 You're not impressed.

831
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:30,840
 No, no.

832
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:36,480
 He's pulled a three-ton vehicle using suction on his abdomen.

833
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:38,280
 I think that's a very bad way of trying to pass

834
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:39,920
 your driving test.

835
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:41,120
 I think if I need--

836
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:42,560
 I told you, he wasn't trying to do that.

837
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:43,960
 He was trying to impress people.

838
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:44,840
 Oh, I see.

839
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:45,920
 Well, he hasn't done that either.

840
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:46,520
 OK.

841
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:49,560
 Did you guys know, one fact about the US military?

842
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:50,480
 Yeah, sure.

843
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:52,120
 And their pens?

844
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:54,240
 Do you know they all use the same pen?

845
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,640
 Just the one is so annoying.

846
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:57,000
 They're sharing this.

847
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,400
 Sorry, General McMaster's got the pen today.

848
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:02,400
 [LAUGHTER]

849
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:04,080
 Do you mean pen as a thing you write with,

850
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:05,600
 or that you keep animals in?

851
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:08,640
 [LAUGHTER]

852
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:09,840
 Yeah, the pen they write with it's

853
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:11,280
 called a Skillcraft pen.

854
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:13,320
 It's the same company that's been making their pen since,

855
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:16,120
 I think, the 1920s.

856
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:17,960
 But apparently, every American listening

857
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:19,160
 will apparently know what it is.

858
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:20,640
 It's used in war zones.

859
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:23,320
 It's designed to fit into US military uniforms.

860
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:24,080
 And--

861
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:25,080
 [LAUGHTER]

862
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:27,640
 It's designed not to be so impossibly large

863
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:30,360
 that it doesn't fit into a normal human pocket.

864
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:31,040
 All right.

865
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:32,560
 Yeah.

866
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:35,080
 So they've got this pen that fits snugly into their uniforms.

867
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:38,960
 It's so quickly designed that it can do that.

868
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:41,400
 It can stand in for a two-inch fuse.

869
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:42,480
 Apparently, it's designed for that.

870
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:43,640
 I don't know how a pen does that.

871
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:44,640
 What?

872
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:47,200
 It comes in handy during emergency tracky otomies, which

873
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,800
 I think a lot of people can do that.

874
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:50,440
 No, pens can't do that, you know?

875
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:51,440
 Oh!

876
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:53,280
 Yeah, there's a study done in actually most pens

877
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:55,320
 are not suitable for tracky otomies.

878
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:56,800
 Well, guys, you better get the Skillcraft

879
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:58,080
 if you feel like you're going to need one.

880
00:31:58,080 --> 00:31:59,920
 So is it where you put a pen--

881
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:01,200
 OK, a pen at work?

882
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,840
 Yeah, you'll see it moving sometimes.

883
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:04,800
 Someone's choking, and then someone goes,

884
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:06,160
 ah, I'm a surgeon.

885
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:08,640
 And here's a biro, and I'll stick it in your neck.

886
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:10,280
 And you can breathe through the pen kind of thing.

887
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:12,520
 But anyway, if you're ever in that situation,

888
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:13,840
 it probably won't work.

889
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:15,880
 Oh, but it would have been stabbed in the neck.

890
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:19,120
 Unless you have one of these special Skillcrafts.

891
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:19,920
 Exactly.

892
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:22,440
 Anyway, more legends about this pen.

893
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:24,400
 So the main thing about it is they're all manufactured

894
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:25,680
 by blind workers.

895
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:28,520
 So it was set up, I think, during the Great Depression,

896
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:30,640
 as a way of giving work to people who would otherwise

897
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:32,480
 find it really difficult to find work.

898
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:34,000
 So everyone who works in the factory

899
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,280
 makes this doesn't have sight.

900
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:39,160
 And there are 16 page specifications

901
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:41,200
 for exactly what the pen has to be able to do.

902
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:43,840
 It needs to be able to write continuously for a mile,

903
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:46,440
 and in temperatures of up to 160 degrees

904
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:48,800
 and down to minus 40 degrees.

905
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,080
 All quite important for the army.

906
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:52,240
 If you've got secret messages that you need to get--

907
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:54,000
 I don't know when you're going to be in the army,

908
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,640
 and you have to write a line that's a mile long.

909
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:59,560
 Well, maybe you need to show your troops the ways

910
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:00,640
 of the nearest base.

911
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:03,600
 Yeah, it's a mile away.

912
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:05,200
 Wow, that sounds amazing.

913
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:07,040
 It's surrounded by legend.

914
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:08,840
 Apparently, the length of the pen

915
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:12,640
 is equivalent to 150 nautical miles on Navy maps.

916
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:15,680
 And that makes it easy for people in the Navy

917
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:17,920
 to navigate, because they use that pen,

918
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:20,120
 and they know that that equals 150 miles on the map.

919
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:22,040
 I mean, they could just look at the scale of the map.

920
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:23,000
 But sometimes--

921
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:26,160
 Because 150-- if it was 100, I could see that almost.

922
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:28,560
 But 150 isn't that round the number.

923
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:29,440
 Do you know what I mean?

924
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:30,880
 But they need to take, like, mentally alert.

925
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:34,760
 So it's important to test their math skills at the same time.

926
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:36,520
 But presumably, they're two inches long,

927
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:39,360
 because they can be used as a two-inch fuse.

928
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:42,560
 Yeah, maybe there's a bit that's detachable.

929
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:45,000
 But actually, two inches is quite a small pen.

930
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,120
 75 centimeters long.

931
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:47,840
 And that obviously would fit snugly

932
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:50,720
 inside the average soldier's uniform.

933
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:54,720
 5 centimeters is about that long, which is a short pen.

934
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:55,200
 That is.

935
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:59,480
 It's like a labbrox pen, or an agus pen.

936
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:01,120
 Yeah, agus pencil, yeah.

937
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:02,600
 So they're not that short.

938
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:04,000
 It must be a detachable bit.

939
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:04,840
 OK.

940
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:05,340
 OK.

941
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:07,240
 And you just thought I wanted to know about the SkullCraft pen.

942
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:08,240
 That's great.

943
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:09,280
 Very cool.

944
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:11,320
 I have one more thing about needles.

945
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:14,560
 So you know how mosquitoes bite you?

946
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:15,520
 Yeah, yeah.

947
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:20,200
 They've got six different needles, which I didn't know.

948
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:23,400
 Yeah, so they have this really complicated multi-part drill

949
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:23,600
 bit.

950
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:26,560
 So they have two which drill through the skin.

951
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:30,960
 They have two more which hold the edges of your skin apart.

952
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:34,680
 And there's a fifth one which drops saliva into you to stop

953
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:35,400
 your blood clotting.

954
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:38,360
 And then there's the sixth one which actually sucks the blood up.

955
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:40,800
 But that's not even the cool thing.

956
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:43,760
 The cool thing is how much volume would you say of blood?

957
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:45,800
 Mosquito can fit inside it.

958
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:47,160
 Well, the hand gesture you're making

959
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:49,000
 is about large melon size.

960
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,600
 OK, so how much is the mosquito?

961
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:55,960
 Yeah, so I would say it could fill 50% of its body.

962
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:58,040
 50% of its body, OK?

963
00:34:58,040 --> 00:34:58,960
 Four-year-old child.

964
00:34:58,960 --> 00:34:59,960
 OK.

965
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:05,320
 So if you look at ticks on--

966
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:06,440
 Yeah, yeah.

967
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:07,440
 They can get much bigger.

968
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:09,720
 Then they get about 1,000% of their own body.

969
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:11,280
 Well, here's what the mosquito says.

970
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:14,880
 Mosquitoes can fit 10 times as much blood into them

971
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:16,560
 as the size of a mosquito.

972
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:17,840
 Not through swelling up.

973
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:18,840
 Wow.

974
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:21,160
 What they do is, as her gut fills up,

975
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:25,000
 the female mosquito separates the water in the blood she's

976
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,720
 sucking up from the actual red blood cells.

977
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:31,080
 And she squeezes the water out of her bottom

978
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:32,920
 so she can fit more red blood cells, which

979
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:34,360
 is the good stuff that you can get.

980
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:36,880
 So does that mean that when a mosquito's biting you,

981
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:39,240
 it's also pissing?

982
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:40,280
 Well, it's your blood, though.

983
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:41,720
 It's the water from your blood, then.

984
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:42,840
 Yeah, but it doesn't matter where--

985
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:44,320
 When you're at 80, it doesn't matter.

986
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:45,760
 It's like, no, this isn't urine,

987
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:47,880
 because I was drinking orange juice earlier, right?

988
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:52,120
 Yeah, it's orange juice officer.

989
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:53,800
 It's just orange juice I'm pouring away here.

990
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:56,720
 Please tell the rest of me.

991
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:58,600
 Also, at that point, is it a mosquito

992
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:01,920
 with blood in it, or is it a lot of blood?

993
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:03,320
 It's with a mosquito around it.

994
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:04,120
 It's actually both.

995
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:04,720
 Is it?

996
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:05,720
 Yeah.

997
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:08,720
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

998
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:13,920
 OK, it is time for our final fact of the show.

999
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:15,920
 And that is Chazinski.

1000
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:19,040
 My fact is that if you drew a dot in indelible ink

1001
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:21,800
 on your eardrum, it would appear on the outside of your ear

1002
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:23,120
 within a few weeks.

1003
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:25,400
 Are you using the skill craft pen?

1004
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:27,200
 So beloved by the US Army.

1005
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:28,400
 Yeah, also--

1006
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:30,640
 I was just thinking the skill craft pen would be good

1007
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:34,880
 if you wanted to put it in the cloaca of chickens.

1008
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:37,720
 Specifically designed to fit in the chicken cloaca.

1009
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:38,320
 Yeah.

1010
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:39,120
 And in a human ear.

1011
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:42,600
 And also, a chickens cloaca, if you put it on a map,

1012
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:46,480
 it's exactly 150 kilopters.

1013
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:48,120
 If you don't have your pen.

1014
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:50,320
 But it messes up the map.

1015
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:52,040
 Where's the hazard work?

1016
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:52,880
 What do you mean?

1017
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:53,880
 It's amazing.

1018
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:56,560
 So the way the eardrum works is that the skin

1019
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:58,960
 grows outwards in a spiral, because it

1020
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:02,000
 needs to carry dead skin out away from the eardrum,

1021
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,360
 and then to the outside world where it falls off.

1022
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:09,560
 And it grows at about the same rate as fingernails, I think.

1023
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:11,800
 And so the skin starts off in your eardrum.

1024
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:14,320
 And then it's carried out, picks up earwax, picks up all the dust,

1025
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:16,560
 transports it outside the ear, falls out.

1026
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:20,680
 Same speed as continent's move, because they always say

1027
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:22,120
 that's the same as a fingernail, don't they?

1028
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:23,120
 They do.

1029
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:26,640
 Wait, so-- and also, it's a bit like a conveyor belt system?

1030
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:27,240
 Exactly.

1031
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:29,120
 And it's all the skin on your body.

1032
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:30,800
 Does that originate in the ear?

1033
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:33,640
 Or does it-- does it start?

1034
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:36,240
 Is there a barrier where it stops growing outwards?

1035
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:39,360
 If you drew a little start on your eardrum,

1036
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:43,440
 then it just moves around the body.

1037
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:48,080
 You'd have it if you want to get a tattoo very slowly.

1038
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:49,080
 How did you get that--

1039
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:51,480
 I'm not saying that the body is built

1040
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:53,560
 from the earwax.

1041
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:55,560
 It just falls off, and you leave it behind.

1042
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:57,640
 But it must fall off at a certain point.

1043
00:37:57,640 --> 00:37:58,520
 Yeah.

1044
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:00,840
 How far out of your ear before it falls off?

1045
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:03,480
 On your foot.

1046
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:06,200
 At the end of the big toe, it falls off.

1047
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:09,280
 That's why your socks are always full of loose skin.

1048
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:10,680
 With dots on them.

1049
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:12,560
 That's right.

1050
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:15,320
 No, actually, most of it is reabsorbed, actually.

1051
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:17,560
 I think most earwax is reabsorbed back into the body

1052
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:19,120
 before it reaches the outside.

1053
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:21,200
 So I'm confused about this, because obviously,

1054
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:22,520
 you get earwax in the ears, and this

1055
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:25,120
 is related to the ear drum.

1056
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:26,120
 Yes, so--

1057
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:26,880
 Is it reduced at the ear drum?

1058
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:27,640
 It waxes.

1059
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:29,760
 But ear wax is actually mostly dead skin.

1060
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:30,760
 Yeah.

1061
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:31,400
 Oh, it is.

1062
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:31,920
 OK.

1063
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:33,880
 That's what was confusing me, because yeah,

1064
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:35,040
 I didn't know what it was made of.

1065
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:36,720
 So it's got this kind of waxy stuff,

1066
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:39,240
 but it's basically the big mass of it

1067
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:41,240
 is bits of dead skin from your ear drum.

1068
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:44,120
 So it's produced by these glands inside your ear,

1069
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:46,360
 which I think are in the sort of outer ear.

1070
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:47,880
 So the dead skin spirals up a bit,

1071
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:51,520
 and then picks up the sticky substance from these glands.

1072
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:53,160
 And it's got like fatty acids in it,

1073
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:55,880
 it's got cholesterol in it, other fats.

1074
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:57,360
 And it also has alcohol in it.

1075
00:38:57,360 --> 00:39:00,000
 So I really wanted to find out what the exact alcohol content

1076
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,360
 of earwax was, and then work out the equivalent of a pine.

1077
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:04,160
 Yeah, I can't.

1078
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:05,880
 How much earwax would you have to eat

1079
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:07,480
 before you went over the legal limit?

1080
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:08,480
 Yeah.

1081
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:10,440
 Oh, poor policeman.

1082
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:12,440
 Who pulls you over?

1083
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:14,400
 You just got a mouthful of earwax.

1084
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:15,920
 You know, those medical trial things

1085
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:18,680
 that people go and do to test things out.

1086
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:20,800
 Imagine being that the gig you get.

1087
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:22,200
 How much would they have to pay you

1088
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:24,960
 to agree to eat enough earwax to get you drunk?

1089
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:26,960
 Well, we don't know how much it is, you see.

1090
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:29,960
 For all we know, it's just like one little tiny bit of earwax

1091
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:31,360
 is enough to put you over the limit.

1092
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:33,760
 Let's say that's a sharp glass full of earwax.

1093
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:34,760
 Right.

1094
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:35,760
 Absolutely.

1095
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:38,800
 Well, I'll negotiate, but I'll start at 10,000.

1096
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:39,800
 10,000?

1097
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:40,600
 Yeah.

1098
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:41,960
 I'll do it for probably a tenor, come on.

1099
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:43,120
 What have I got in there?

1100
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:44,920
 I was going in the other direction.

1101
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:47,800
 Kale, we've agreed that my one's the one.

1102
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:48,800
 OK.

1103
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:50,920
 I think Hannah's currently leading the bed at the moment.

1104
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:55,800
 I reckon we can crowdfot that 10,000, 10 pounds.

1105
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:57,040
 And then you can both do it.

1106
00:39:57,040 --> 00:40:03,000
 So Japanese mothers clean out their kids

1107
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:06,960
 is with these earwax, they're called mini khaki.

1108
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:09,400
 And then when Japanese people grow up,

1109
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:10,680
 they really like the feeling of it.

1110
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:12,360
 And so you get ear salons where you go

1111
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:13,960
 and you pay quite a lot of money to go and have

1112
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:15,440
 your ears cleaned out, same kind of thing.

1113
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:17,640
 But the thing about this is, if you start,

1114
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:19,600
 which all of you would have read, when you start looking up,

1115
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:22,920
 earwax and ears, there's not a single medical professional

1116
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:24,480
 worldwide who doesn't say straight away,

1117
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:26,960
 do not put anything in your ear.

1118
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:28,320
 It's really, really back to you.

1119
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:31,040
 Yeah, but then weirdly, we're all putting our fingers in our ears

1120
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:32,120
 while we're talking about this.

1121
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:33,800
 Yeah, I mean, you just did it then.

1122
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:34,800
 I did, didn't I?

1123
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:38,240
 I put a finger in my ears whenever any of you talk.

1124
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:40,200
 I wonder if people listening to this are also putting

1125
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:41,680
 their fingers in their ears.

1126
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:44,640
 And it's a kind of thing that you just automatically do,

1127
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:47,440
 like, you know, some kind of social things

1128
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:51,560
 that are catching, you know, like a yarn kind of thing.

1129
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:52,320
 Yeah, I bet.

1130
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:53,520
 I spoke to a doctor once he said,

1131
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:55,680
 "You should never put anything smaller than a caulge

1132
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:57,360
 yet in your ear."

1133
00:40:57,360 --> 00:41:00,000
 And the thing was, obviously, you can't fit one of those in,

1134
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,840
 but you shouldn't put anything else in.

1135
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:03,440
 That is exactly the case.

1136
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:06,720
 That's probably true of most, like, holes in your body.

1137
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:10,760
 You shouldn't put anything smaller than a caulge, actually.

1138
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:14,600
 A couple of years ago, they found a cat abandoned in Norfolk,

1139
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:15,280
 right?

1140
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:16,680
 Some people found it abandoned cat,

1141
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:18,680
 and it had three ears.

1142
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:19,440
 Really?

1143
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:20,280
 And...

1144
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:21,480
 Were they all belonging to it?

1145
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:24,360
 Or had it just eating a mouse, is it?

1146
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:27,880
 Yeah, this extra ear on its left-hand side

1147
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:29,080
 in front of its other ear.

1148
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:31,400
 Can you guess what they consider calling it?

1149
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:33,840
 Oh, um...

1150
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:35,120
 It's really good.

1151
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:36,480
 Okay, ear.

1152
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:37,800
 Ear, kitty, kitty.

1153
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:38,800
 That's very good.

1154
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:39,520
 That's very good.

1155
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:41,160
 It's ear, kitty, kitty, surely.

1156
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:42,360
 Make sure, yeah.

1157
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:44,440
 Well, no, it'd be ear, ear, ear, kitty.

1158
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:46,360
 (LAUGHTER)

1159
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:51,000
 Shall I tell you what they called it?

1160
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,440
 And then you'll see, if you can guess why,

1161
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:55,000
 they thought about calling it Captain Kirk.

1162
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,200
 Okay.

1163
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:59,160
 Because he had a wild frontier or something.

1164
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:00,880
 It was an old joke, isn't it?

1165
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:02,400
 Where did they go in Star Trek?

1166
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:03,320
 A final frontier.

1167
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:05,240
 Yes, it's a final frontier.

1168
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:06,320
 Oh, yeah.

1169
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:07,960
 And they considered calling it that,

1170
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:09,440
 and then they called it Brian.

1171
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:12,040
 (LAUGHTER)

1172
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:14,360
 After three-aird Brian.

1173
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:17,160
 Is that the worst outbreak turn of the name?

1174
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:20,280
 (LAUGHTER)

1175
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:23,320
 Speaking of cats, in 1968,

1176
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:26,080
 New York vet Robert A. Lopez wanted to discover

1177
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:27,920
 whether it was possible for the ear mite

1178
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:31,760
 which you're getting cats to infest humans.

1179
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:33,960
 So he removed some mites from a cat's ear,

1180
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:35,640
 mixed them with his earwax,

1181
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:39,040
 and then introduced them into his ear.

1182
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:41,760
 And it turns out they can infest people's ears.

1183
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:44,240
 (LAUGHTER)

1184
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:46,080
 Really hoping for a no in this study.

1185
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:47,560
 Really hoping for a no in this.

1186
00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:48,400
 Wow.

1187
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:50,800
 So it was extremely painful.

1188
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:54,840
 You know, it was loads of sounds in his ear all the time.

1189
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:56,600
 They traveled deeper into his ear drum

1190
00:42:56,600 --> 00:43:00,440
 and they got louder and louder by the third week.

1191
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:02,040
 He was completely deaf in the ear.

1192
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:02,840
 Oh, my God.

1193
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:06,760
 In the fourth week, the mites activity was 75% reduced,

1194
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:07,600
 which is good.

1195
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:11,120
 But he could feel the mites crawling across his face at night.

1196
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:12,680
 Oh.

1197
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:15,200
 On the inside or the outside?

1198
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:17,280
 Across the outside of his face,

1199
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:19,080
 probably trying to find the new ear.

1200
00:43:19,080 --> 00:43:21,080
 (LAUGHTER)

1201
00:43:21,080 --> 00:43:22,080
 Oh, my God.

1202
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:25,120
 So he finished that and then did the experiment two more times.

1203
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:26,840
 (LAUGHTER)

1204
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:28,360
 With his other two ears.

1205
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:30,760
 (LAUGHTER)

1206
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:33,040
 And found that the fex diminished,

1207
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:36,240
 which he said that maybe his body found an immune reaction

1208
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:37,240
 against the mites.

1209
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:38,080
 That's good.

1210
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:40,280
 So there are two ways of avoiding suffering

1211
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:41,720
 from cat-might infestations.

1212
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:44,080
 Either infest yourself repeatedly.

1213
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:45,280
 Or just don't do it in the first place.

1214
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:47,440
 (LAUGHTER)

1215
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:49,200
 There was a woman who she had a spider in her ear,

1216
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:50,200
 didn't she?

1217
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:51,400
 She had a live tarantula in her ear.

1218
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:54,480
 No, you're thinking of the nursery rhyme, I think.

1219
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:55,480
 Yeah.

1220
00:43:55,480 --> 00:43:56,680
 Because it was the fly first.

1221
00:43:56,680 --> 00:44:00,240
 There was no lady who put a fly in her ear.

1222
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:01,040
 I don't know why.

1223
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:02,680
 Now she can't hear.

1224
00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:03,920
 No, there was.

1225
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:06,760
 There was a woman who had a live tarantula removed from her ear.

1226
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:09,280
 And she inserted the colljettes to get rid of them.

1227
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:10,880
 (LAUGHTER)

1228
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:16,800
