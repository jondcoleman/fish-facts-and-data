00:00:15,00:00:21,"Hello and welcome to another episode of no such thing as a fish, a weekly podcast coming"
00:00:21,00:00:24,to you from the QI offices in Covent Garden.
00:00:24,00:00:28,"My name is Dan Shriver, I'm sitting here with Andrew Huntamari."
00:00:28,00:00:34,"Anna Chazizki and James Harkin, and once again we have gathered around the microphones"
00:00:34,00:00:39,"with our four favorite facts from the last seven days and in a particular order, here we"
00:00:39,00:00:41,"go, starting with you, Andy."
00:00:41,00:00:42,Thank you.
00:00:42,00:00:49,Well that incredibly forgetful introduction.
00:00:49,00:00:53,My fact this week is that chicken's eggs turn from pointy end first to the blunt end
00:00:53,00:00:55,first just before they come out.
00:00:55,00:00:57,Like a baby?
00:00:57,00:00:58,Like a baby.
00:00:58,00:01:03,"I don't know if babies have a pointy end, but when a baby is getting ready, yeah I guess"
00:01:03,00:01:04,the head is the head.
00:01:04,00:01:08,"So when you're getting ready to be born, babies will go into dive position."
00:01:08,00:01:09,Well most babies do.
00:01:09,00:01:10,Most babies.
00:01:10,00:01:12,I was a breach as was my brother.
00:01:12,00:01:16,"So I wonder if chickens have the same thing, where sometimes you get a breach one where"
00:01:16,00:01:17,it's...
00:01:17,00:01:18,Or quid eggs.
00:01:18,00:01:19,"Or quid eggs, yeah."
00:01:19,00:01:21,And sometimes they have to Susereen it out because it's the pointy end first and it's
00:01:21,00:01:23,just too difficult.
00:01:23,00:01:26,"Yeah, which seems counterinduitive, doesn't it?"
00:01:26,00:01:31,"So why do they come out that end first, once you get past the most rounded bit, it probably"
00:01:31,00:01:32,just fires out.
00:01:32,00:01:33,Yeah.
00:01:33,00:01:34,It's exactly like a baby.
00:01:34,00:01:37,That's why it's harder with a baby when they come out next to us because you have to push
00:01:37,00:01:39,"hardest right at the end, don't you?"
00:01:39,00:01:44,"Babies should come out like, you know, like in the pencil position, like a pencil dive."
00:01:44,00:01:49,"Or like a diver the other way around, with the hands in a diving position."
00:01:49,00:01:50,That'd be good.
00:01:50,00:01:55,That's how I imagined Tom Daly was born.
00:01:55,00:01:56,My water's broken.
00:01:56,00:01:59,And there's lots of them.
00:01:59,00:02:02,Judges hold of the date.
00:02:02,00:02:04,I was talking about Tom Daly the other day.
00:02:04,00:02:08,"I have a theory that it might not even be a theory, it might be a fact."
00:02:08,00:02:13,"But if you were a diver and you dive off high boards, half of your training must be just"
00:02:13,00:02:14,walking upstairs.
00:02:14,00:02:16,Now it's not a fact.
00:02:16,00:02:18,"No, I think that was a fact."
00:02:18,00:02:19,What do you mean by training?
00:02:19,00:02:23,"Well, because if you're not used to walking upstairs, like Anna and I walked up some stairs"
00:02:23,00:02:29,"the other day and I almost died, you lose your energy and he's got to now do a dive once"
00:02:29,00:02:30,he's at the top of them.
00:02:30,00:02:31,Those boards are really high.
00:02:31,00:02:32,That's really steep stairs.
00:02:32,00:02:36,"But they are elite sports people, not like you walking up the stairs that cover garden."
00:02:36,00:02:39,"But they must, they must part of their training must be like climb up some stairs."
00:02:39,00:02:40,It must be.
00:02:40,00:02:41,No.
00:02:41,00:02:44,No possible reason why you wouldn't train them to climb stairs all the time.
00:02:44,00:02:49,"Actually, then elite divers have chair lifts so they can conserve their energy."
00:02:49,00:02:50,There we go.
00:02:50,00:02:55,"Done, do you understand that if you get fit at one thing, sometimes that means you're fit"
00:02:55,00:02:56,at loads of other things.
00:02:56,00:03:00,"So if I become like a champion runner, I'll also probably find it easy to go upstairs."
00:03:00,00:03:01,I don't disagree with that.
00:03:01,00:03:02,I don't disagree with that.
00:03:02,00:03:03,I don't think that's true.
00:03:03,00:03:04,I think it uses different muscles.
00:03:04,00:03:05,Yeah.
00:03:05,00:03:06,"But if you've seen these divers, they're like super fit."
00:03:06,00:03:07,I'm not saying--
00:03:07,00:03:08,They're not like flabby ass.
00:03:08,00:03:12,"People try to get up the stairs, are they?"
00:03:12,00:03:16,"I'm annoyed that I've been bounced into the position now, supposedly saying that divers"
00:03:16,00:03:17,are not fit.
00:03:17,00:03:21,"You know, because all those competitions where they take a rest off way out, don't they?"
00:03:21,00:03:22,They have a sit down.
00:03:22,00:03:28,"Now, if the whole point of diving was to make the biggest splash possible, then you would"
00:03:28,00:03:30,have a lot of out-of-shape people climbing up.
00:03:30,00:03:31,Yeah.
00:03:31,00:03:32,And then that would be a problem.
00:03:32,00:03:33,Yes.
00:03:33,00:03:34,But did you mean--
00:03:34,00:03:35,Because they might not make it to the dive.
00:03:35,00:03:36,"Well, that would be part of the--"
00:03:36,00:03:37,That's part of the competition.
00:03:37,00:03:38,Yeah.
00:03:38,00:03:41,"So you have to be big enough to make a massive splash, but not big enough that you can't"
00:03:41,00:03:43,get to the top floor.
00:03:43,00:03:45,And that's the two tensions.
00:03:45,00:03:46,Yeah.
00:03:46,00:03:47,I'm starting to think.
00:03:47,00:03:48,You're right.
00:03:48,00:03:49,Yeah.
00:03:49,00:03:50,So hang on.
00:03:50,00:03:53,You're saying that do you mean half a time that divers benched?
00:03:53,00:03:57,I'm just saying I didn't factor in that that's half the gig getting up to the board.
00:03:57,00:04:02,"But then I think if you, once it's been a leaked diver, and you spent half of your training"
00:04:02,00:04:07,"time climbing up and downstairs, and only half of your training time learning how to"
00:04:07,00:04:10,"actually dive, probably--"
00:04:10,00:04:11,But they must--
00:04:11,00:04:12,"No, it's right."
00:04:12,00:04:13,They must do.
00:04:13,00:04:14,How long does it take to get up those stairs?
00:04:14,00:04:15,30 seconds.
00:04:15,00:04:17,But how long do you spend fapping around getting ready for the dive?
00:04:17,00:04:18,Probably about 30 seconds.
00:04:18,00:04:20,They're probably catching their breath again.
00:04:20,00:04:25,"They're not all-- that's not where all training happens, of course, with divers."
00:04:25,00:04:27,They do a lot in maths and stuff like that.
00:04:27,00:04:28,It's a lot of gymnastics and stuff like that.
00:04:28,00:04:29,"Yeah, I didn't know that."
00:04:29,00:04:30,I see.
00:04:30,00:04:32,You're just saying they spend half their time because to practice--
00:04:32,00:04:33,Yeah.
00:04:33,00:04:34,--you do have to go up the stairs.
00:04:34,00:04:36,We're just down saying they actually need to practice going up the stairs.
00:04:36,00:04:40,"If you got there and you don't even have time to complete the first half of your modules,"
00:04:40,00:04:51,you just got to the top of the stairs.
00:04:51,00:04:53,Something about the man who discovered this.
00:04:53,00:04:57,The man who discovered-- I'm just a reminder of the fact that chicken's eggs turn from pointy
00:04:57,00:05:00,end first to blunt end first just before they hatch.
00:05:00,00:05:04,"He was an egg scientist, he studied birds and bird's eggs."
00:05:04,00:05:10,"And he was called Heinrich Wickman, or Wickman, and he found out by marking the eggs with"
00:05:10,00:05:15,"a pencil, up the birds, just an hour before they laid the eggs."
00:05:15,00:05:19,So he inserted a pencil into the bird's cloaca.
00:05:19,00:05:20,Wow.
00:05:20,00:05:21,I know.
00:05:21,00:05:25,"Anyway, I got this in a book called The Most Perfect Thing as a book all about birds eggs by"
00:05:25,00:05:26,guy called Tim Burkehead.
00:05:26,00:05:27,And I do recommend it.
00:05:27,00:05:28,It's a really interesting book.
00:05:28,00:05:34,An egg shape is-- that specific shape is the most pleasing shape that it could be to
00:05:34,00:05:35,us.
00:05:35,00:05:38,So they've done some brain tests that look at the kind of surface curvature that humans
00:05:38,00:05:40,find most pleasing.
00:05:40,00:05:42,"And across all societies, it's that exact curvature."
00:05:42,00:05:43,Wow.
00:05:43,00:05:46,"So if it goes more pointy or more squash, then we don't enjoy looking at it as much."
00:05:46,00:05:52,And I think it's because we've evolved to think that that's what a healthy bit of tissue
00:05:52,00:05:53,development would look like.
00:05:53,00:05:57,"But what's interesting is that different eggs are different sizes for different birds,"
00:05:57,00:05:58,aren't they?
00:05:58,00:05:59,So is this a chicken egg you're talking about?
00:05:59,00:06:00,"Chicken egg, yeah."
00:06:00,00:06:01,Interesting.
00:06:01,00:06:04,"But they're often quite-- you do get more rounded eggs, but you don't get, like, really"
00:06:04,00:06:05,long thing.
00:06:05,00:06:11,"It's way off, then, because then the bird that was born in them, like maybe a snake's egg would"
00:06:11,00:06:12,be like that.
00:06:12,00:06:13,A stick bird.
00:06:13,00:06:14,A stick bird.
00:06:14,00:06:16,A stick flamingo egg would be like that.
00:06:16,00:06:17,Yeah.
00:06:17,00:06:19,But you do get round ones.
00:06:19,00:06:20,You do get round ones.
00:06:20,00:06:21,Yeah.
00:06:21,00:06:22,Who do round ones?
00:06:22,00:06:23,Some other ones.
00:06:23,00:06:24,"Some other birds, too."
00:06:24,00:06:25,Yeah.
00:06:25,00:06:26,There was a theory.
00:06:26,00:06:30,"I don't think this might not be true anymore, but the idea that the egg shape ones don't really"
00:06:30,00:06:32,roll out of nest very well.
00:06:32,00:06:37,"The ones which are more rounded are ones that lay eggs on the floor, so they might not fall"
00:06:37,00:06:38,out of trees as likely.
00:06:38,00:06:39,Yeah.
00:06:39,00:06:40,Are you going to debunk that theory?
00:06:40,00:06:43,"I've read a debunk, but I can't-- I didn't look into it properly."
00:06:43,00:06:45,"There is something in this book about it as well, actually."
00:06:45,00:06:46,I can't remember chapter and verse.
00:06:46,00:06:47,Yeah.
00:06:47,00:06:51,"They could have done, in order to find it out with modern technology, a sort of X-ray"
00:06:51,00:06:52,video.
00:06:52,00:06:57,Because do you remember those that incredible photo of what a kiwi bird looks like just
00:06:57,00:06:58,before it gives birth?
00:06:58,00:06:59,Yeah.
00:06:59,00:07:00,I used to have that picture on my wall.
00:07:00,00:07:04,It's so-- I don't think we just love the curvature so much.
00:07:04,00:07:09,"Well, it's just because you're looking at it going, is this a kiwi with an egg in it, or"
00:07:09,00:07:12,is this an egg with a kiwi over it?
00:07:12,00:07:13,It's both.
00:07:13,00:07:14,It's really.
00:07:14,00:07:15,It's both.
00:07:15,00:07:16,They're both the same size.
00:07:16,00:07:17,Are you inside your clothes?
00:07:17,00:07:19,Are they outside of you?
00:07:19,00:07:21,I think this James is both.
00:07:21,00:07:22,Is it?
00:07:22,00:07:23,Yeah.
00:07:23,00:07:24,Why am I mind that?
00:07:24,00:07:27,"The equivalent-- if a kiwi bird, when you see this picture, and I highly recommend Google"
00:07:27,00:07:28,this picture--
00:07:28,00:07:30,"Yeah, I'll put it on my Twitter."
00:07:30,00:07:32,I'll put on a kiwi podcast as well.
00:07:32,00:07:34,It's equivalent to a human giving birth to a four-year-old.
00:07:34,00:07:35,Oh.
00:07:35,00:07:36,Oh.
00:07:36,00:07:37,That's how big the egg is.
00:07:37,00:07:39,And they're all wearing jumpers and things.
00:07:39,00:07:43,That would be especially scratchy and difficult.
00:07:43,00:07:44,Leggo.
00:07:44,00:07:45,Leggo.
00:07:45,00:07:47,Jumping into your whole way out.
00:07:47,00:07:52,Did you know that mammals evolved milk in order to wet their eggs?
00:07:52,00:07:53,What?
00:07:53,00:07:54,I don't even understand that.
00:07:54,00:07:55,Yeah.
00:07:55,00:07:56,I know.
00:07:56,00:07:57,Like cooked chicken eggs?
00:07:57,00:07:58,For it.
00:07:58,00:08:02,Not-- we didn't-- we didn't evolve milk
00:08:02,00:08:03,so we could poach a good egg in here.
00:08:03,00:08:05,[LAUGHTER]
00:08:05,00:08:06,What's the egg?
00:08:06,00:08:07,What eggs?
00:08:07,00:08:13,"So millions of years ago, when our ancestors were still laying eggs, they didn't have shells."
00:08:13,00:08:16,"So they had, like, quite a porous membrane."
00:08:16,00:08:19,And that meant that they would dry out really easily.
00:08:19,00:08:24,"And so we evolved milk, people think, now, in order to, like, put it over the eggs."
00:08:24,00:08:25,What?
00:08:25,00:08:28,Make sure that they didn't get dehydrated.
00:08:28,00:08:33,And then we realized-- evolution realized-- that quite a good use of this milk would be as
00:08:33,00:08:38,a way of transferring some nutrients into the offspring in our egg.
00:08:38,00:08:41,"And so we developed more and more nutrients in our milk, and then kept putting that in the"
00:08:41,00:08:42,egg.
00:08:42,00:08:46,"And then eventually, that our milk became so nutrient-filled that it became just something"
00:08:46,00:08:48,we could nurture a baby with.
00:08:48,00:08:50,That is cool.
00:08:50,00:08:51,Wow.
00:08:51,00:08:56,I was reading that you can know what color an egg is going to be from a chicken by looking
00:08:56,00:08:57,at its ears.
00:08:57,00:09:00,"Chicken's done of external ears, do they?"
00:09:00,00:09:01,They have earlobes.
00:09:01,00:09:02,Have earlobes?
00:09:02,00:09:03,Do they?
00:09:03,00:09:04,Yeah.
00:09:04,00:09:05,Prominent.
00:09:05,00:09:06,You've seen them.
00:09:06,00:09:08,I think maybe you just didn't think of them as being earlobes.
00:09:08,00:09:09,Yeah.
00:09:09,00:09:13,"So if they have white earlobes, they'll have white eggs."
00:09:13,00:09:16,"And if they have red earlobes, they'll have brown eggs."
00:09:16,00:09:20,"This, the article stresses, is not always the case."
00:09:20,00:09:21,Right.
00:09:21,00:09:22,OK.
00:09:22,00:09:26,But they do say that it's something that people have noticed more often than not.
00:09:26,00:09:27,"It's almost always the case, I think."
00:09:27,00:09:30,You can tell it's going to be a color similar to the earlobes.
00:09:30,00:09:33,"Are you, Andy, as imagining a chicken with human ears?"
00:09:33,00:09:34,Yeah.
00:09:34,00:09:35,Yeah.
00:09:35,00:09:36,And it's disgusting.
00:09:36,00:09:37,Yeah.
00:09:37,00:09:38,You ever seen a chicken?
00:09:38,00:09:39,Do you know what a chicken is?
00:09:39,00:09:40,Yeah.
00:09:40,00:09:41,OK.
00:09:41,00:09:42,Yeah.
00:09:42,00:09:43,"I just was, because this is your fact."
00:09:43,00:09:47,So I was just checking you had Google chicken before you came in here.
00:09:47,00:09:48,Yeah.
00:09:48,00:09:50,"I think it's not the first thing you see when you look at a chicken, though, is it?"
00:09:50,00:09:54,You see the feathers and you see the beak.
00:09:54,00:09:55,It's not the initial--
00:09:55,00:09:58,"And sometimes the little feathery trousers, you know, the little spurs they have."
00:09:58,00:09:59,Those are pretty cute.
00:09:59,00:10:00,"Oh, yeah."
00:10:00,00:10:02,Those were the big cowboys told.
00:10:02,00:10:05,But it's not like elephants were the first thing you see as there is.
00:10:05,00:10:06,Yeah.
00:10:06,00:10:09,"The first thing you see on an elephant is the trunks, James."
00:10:09,00:10:11,"Well, I'm looking for the side."
00:10:11,00:10:12,Yeah.
00:10:12,00:10:14,It's facing away from you.
00:10:14,00:10:15,I can't catch a slay.
00:10:15,00:10:21,[MUSIC PLAYING]
00:10:21,00:10:24,"OK, it is time to move on to fact number two."
00:10:24,00:10:26,And that is James.
00:10:26,00:10:30,"OK, my fact this week is that the former prime minister of Georgia"
00:10:30,00:10:34,"has started taking famous trees from around his country, digging them up,"
00:10:34,00:10:37,and then planting them in his own garden.
00:10:37,00:10:39,"He's like, he's personally digging them up."
00:10:39,00:10:40,He's digging them up.
00:10:40,00:10:41,It's amazing.
00:10:41,00:10:45,"So I was re-- so for our book, which is coming out in November,"
00:10:45,00:10:47,I was reading about the world geopolitical situation.
00:10:47,00:10:49,And there's things happening in Georgia.
00:10:49,00:10:52,There's elections in Abkhazia where they're trying to get out of Georgia.
00:10:52,00:10:55,"And while I was reading that, I came across this guy."
00:10:55,00:10:57,And I can't believe I've never heard about him before.
00:10:57,00:11:01,"He's called Bidzina Ivanishvili, and he's taking trees from around the country,"
00:11:01,00:11:04,"and I've had driving them or putting them on a ship,"
00:11:04,00:11:06,and then taking them to his house and planting them.
00:11:06,00:11:08,"And he says, it's my hobby."
00:11:08,00:11:10,I really love big trees.
00:11:10,00:11:13,Giant trees are my entertainments.
00:11:13,00:11:16,How many famous trees are there in Georgia?
00:11:16,00:11:17,And not as many as they used to be.
00:11:17,00:11:17,Ah.
00:11:17,00:11:20,[LAUGHTER]
00:11:20,00:11:21,So this is the thing.
00:11:21,00:11:25,"He reckons that it's a good idea, because before the people who have the trees on their land"
00:11:25,00:11:26,might not have been properly looking after them.
00:11:26,00:11:31,"And so if he puts them on his land, then he'll be able to look after them on his arboretum."
00:11:31,00:11:33,But ecologists are skeptical.
00:11:33,00:11:37,"Well, it does say, doesn't he, though, that he'll plant 10 trees for everyone that he takes away?"
00:11:37,00:11:39,Or I think at least he did that for one of them.
00:11:39,00:11:41,He did that for this giant tulip tree.
00:11:41,00:11:43,It was a 650-ton tulip tree.
00:11:43,00:11:44,Whoa.
00:11:44,00:11:47,I thought tulips were like small.
00:11:47,00:11:49,"Yeah, I thought they were as well."
00:11:49,00:11:52,I guess this is just one 650-ton tulip.
00:11:52,00:11:53,"Yeah, well, you know his context, actually."
00:11:53,00:11:55,It's all in the way the photo's done.
00:11:55,00:11:57,So you know those fields of tulips you see in the Netherlands.
00:11:57,00:11:58,Those are actually all massive.
00:11:58,00:11:59,[LAUGHTER]
00:11:59,00:12:01,"Well, you do see the upwind mill, though."
00:12:01,00:12:03,So maybe Dutch windmills are absolutely massive.
00:12:03,00:12:04,They're even bigger.
00:12:04,00:12:05,I bet.
00:12:05,00:12:06,Maybe he's just chuping them all.
00:12:06,00:12:08,Maybe he's told them it's a tulip tree.
00:12:08,00:12:10,"So he's like, oh, I'll just give you these extra tulip seeds."
00:12:10,00:12:13,"You could have 10 of them, cab as well as you want."
00:12:13,00:12:15,"This guy, he does sound amazing, though."
00:12:15,00:12:16,He is incredible.
00:12:16,00:12:18,"And he's got this mansion, hasn't he, which"
00:12:18,00:12:20,"is kind of disgusting, if you look it up."
00:12:20,00:12:24,"And it's basically, it is the James Bond mansion."
00:12:24,00:12:26,It's like a giant glass spaceship.
00:12:26,00:12:27,Yeah.
00:12:27,00:12:29,"And it's on a mountain side, isn't it?"
00:12:29,00:12:31,So it overlooks the capital of his country
00:12:31,00:12:32,from a mountain side.
00:12:32,00:12:33,Yeah.
00:12:33,00:12:35,So the indie went and interviewed him.
00:12:35,00:12:38,"And when he went there, he said,"
00:12:38,00:12:42,there are eight different breeds of peacock and I have them all.
00:12:42,00:12:46,"So he really likes collecting loads of stuff, basically."
00:12:46,00:12:47,"Yeah, he has loads of animals, doesn't he?"
00:12:47,00:12:51,"He has zebras, what else do you see?"
00:12:51,00:12:52,Kangaroos.
00:12:52,00:12:53,"Kangaroos, penguins."
00:12:53,00:12:56,He is also rumored to have a shark tank.
00:12:56,00:12:58,"He does, yeah."
00:12:58,00:13:00,"Yeah, he does because he has to keep importing loads of salt"
00:13:00,00:13:03,"for it all the time, I think, like gallons of salt."
00:13:03,00:13:04,"Apparently, in the whole way of his house,"
00:13:04,00:13:07,"he has a work by Gilbert and George with a slogan that says,"
00:13:07,00:13:10,"""Say fuck off to rich bastards."""
00:13:10,00:13:13,His net worth is $4.8 billion.
00:13:13,00:13:17,"Yeah, I think his net worth is like 50% of the GDP of Georgia,"
00:13:17,00:13:18,doesn't it?
00:13:18,00:13:19,"No, no."
00:13:19,00:13:21,"It's between a third and a half, depending on which source you read."
00:13:21,00:13:22,"But it is, yeah."
00:13:22,00:13:25,"Well, he sounds like the right man to be the former leader"
00:13:25,00:13:26,"of the country, doesn't he?"
00:13:26,00:13:26,Yeah.
00:13:26,00:13:28,"If he is, basically, the GDP of Georgia."
00:13:28,00:13:28,"Well, indeed."
00:13:28,00:13:30,"Yeah, that's true."
00:13:30,00:13:32,"And just quickly, on trees in Georgia,"
00:13:32,00:13:34,I don't think I'm going to get another chance
00:13:34,00:13:35,to get my trees in Georgia factor out of this.
00:13:35,00:13:36,"Well, that's what I have next week."
00:13:36,00:13:37,"Yeah, it's possible."
00:13:37,00:13:38,You could put it in the book.
00:13:38,00:13:39,"Oh, yeah."
00:13:39,00:13:43,"Well, just in case I don't do that."
00:13:43,00:13:45,"So basically, Georgia breed Christmas trees."
00:13:45,00:13:48,And you know the tree that we call the nordman fur
00:13:48,00:13:49,and it gets called the Caucasian fur.
00:13:49,00:13:52,"It's basically the famous Christmas tree in Europe,"
00:13:52,00:13:56,as in 45 million gets sold all around Western Europe each year.
00:13:56,00:13:59,"These trees are grown elsewhere,"
00:13:59,00:14:01,"but they're originally from Georgia,"
00:14:01,00:14:05,"as in the seeds that grow them, or from Georgian Christmas trees."
00:14:05,00:14:06,And people in Georgia climb up them
00:14:06,00:14:07,and they're massive.
00:14:07,00:14:09,"OK, so it's quite dangerous."
00:14:09,00:14:10,There are fatalities every year.
00:14:10,00:14:13,"They collect the cones, which have got the seeds inside them,"
00:14:13,00:14:15,and then they sell the seeds to places like Denmark.
00:14:15,00:14:17,And then Denmark actually does the work of growing
00:14:17,00:14:18,and selling the trees.
00:14:18,00:14:20,"But Georgia misses out, because obviously,"
00:14:20,00:14:22,you need loads and loads of pine cones.
00:14:22,00:14:23,And then they get sold for much more.
00:14:23,00:14:26,"It's like drugs, you know, it starts off quite cheap."
00:14:26,00:14:28,But the street value of these trees is massive.
00:14:28,00:14:31,"So the Georgians, I think, they want to break into that"
00:14:31,00:14:32,and start growing their own trees.
00:14:32,00:14:33,"Say no to pinecons, kids."
00:14:33,00:14:35,Yeah.
00:14:35,00:14:37,"Hey, while we're just on Christmas trees,"
00:14:37,00:14:42,did you guys know that elephants floss using Christmas trees?
00:14:42,00:14:43,Mm.
00:14:43,00:14:44,Have you guys heard that?
00:14:44,00:14:45,No.
00:14:45,00:14:46,I don't think that's true.
00:14:46,00:14:47,It's true.
00:14:47,00:14:47,It's true.
00:14:47,00:14:49,Elephants floss using Christmas trees.
00:14:49,00:14:51,At least that's what I read.
00:14:51,00:14:53,"In Germany, they've got this tradition every year."
00:14:53,00:14:56,So they give their Christmas trees to the elephants at the zoo.
00:14:56,00:14:58,And people just hand over their trees.
00:14:58,00:14:59,And the elephants eat them.
00:14:59,00:15:01,They can get through like three trees a day.
00:15:01,00:15:03,But they also have been seen flossing with them.
00:15:03,00:15:06,So I guess flossing the tree out of their teeth.
00:15:06,00:15:08,But holding it with their trunk and then in and out
00:15:08,00:15:09,between their teeth.
00:15:09,00:15:11,"Yeah, I mean, I haven't seen any pictures myself."
00:15:11,00:15:14,They must be because they don't have opposable thumbs today.
00:15:14,00:15:15,So it must be with their trunk.
00:15:15,00:15:17,That's the only prehand style part of their body.
00:15:17,00:15:17,Yeah.
00:15:17,00:15:20,But it's weird that you would try and get a tree out with a tree.
00:15:20,00:15:22,And how would it not be?
00:15:22,00:15:23,Would it not be that that tree would get stuck?
00:15:23,00:15:24,"Oh, yeah."
00:15:24,00:15:25,Then you get a slightly larger tree.
00:15:25,00:15:29,It's the elephant version of the old woman who swallowed a fly.
00:15:29,00:15:31,It's the elephant who flossed with a Christmas tree.
00:15:31,00:15:32,Yeah.
00:15:32,00:15:34,"Eventually has to swallow a tulip tree, which"
00:15:34,00:15:37,"is the biggest on Earth, apparently."
00:15:37,00:15:39,"Speaking of trees, by the way, very quickly, we have just"
00:15:39,00:15:41,discovered that there were more trees on Earth
00:15:41,00:15:43,than we thought there were.
00:15:43,00:15:47,So there are now 427 million hectares more
00:15:47,00:15:49,trees than we thought there were on Earth.
00:15:49,00:15:51,How many did I think there were?
00:15:51,00:15:55,427 million hectares less than the number you've got in your head.
00:15:55,00:15:55,Yeah.
00:15:55,00:15:58,So minus that from whatever you've had
00:15:58,00:16:00,"to put it into context, by the way."
00:16:00,00:16:04,"That is, if all that tree, the new tree was put into a place,"
00:16:04,00:16:09,"a single place, it would take up 60% of the surface of Australia."
00:16:09,00:16:11,That's actually kind of less than I thought it would be.
00:16:11,00:16:11,Yeah.
00:16:11,00:16:15,"But no, is that only the bonus trees that we've got?"
00:16:15,00:16:16,"It's not all the trees in the world, is it?"
00:16:16,00:16:16,"Yeah, yeah."
00:16:16,00:16:19,That's the extra bonus trees.
00:16:19,00:16:22,So we can't just go nuts and start cutting down all the trees.
00:16:22,00:16:24,Because we're the prime minister of Georgia.
00:16:24,00:16:25,"Well, the ex prime minister of Georgia."
00:16:25,00:16:28,What it does mean is that he's got a lot more to collect now.
00:16:28,00:16:30,But he's not collecting every tree.
00:16:30,00:16:32,He's just collecting individual examples.
00:16:32,00:16:34,Is he collecting all the trees in the world?
00:16:34,00:16:35,That is the famous tree.
00:16:35,00:16:36,"Oh, we don't know, do we?"
00:16:36,00:16:38,Because we only know where he's got to sell far.
00:16:38,00:16:39,We don't know where he's going to start.
00:16:39,00:16:40,Because maybe he's starting with the most famous.
00:16:40,00:16:43,But his list includes every single tree on the planet.
00:16:43,00:16:45,And he's just working his way down.
00:16:45,00:16:46,That's the least famous tree.
00:16:46,00:16:47,"Exactly, yeah."
00:16:47,00:16:48,What is the least famous tree?
00:16:48,00:16:49,Nobody knows.
00:16:49,00:16:51,That was the thing.
00:16:51,00:16:54,"Well, only he knows, and his mother."
00:16:54,00:16:56,Did I ever tell you guys that my dad--
00:16:56,00:16:58,so I used to live when I was born in Hong Kong.
00:16:58,00:17:01,We lived in an island just off Hong Kong called Discovery Bay.
00:17:01,00:17:03,And my parents lived in this house.
00:17:03,00:17:05,"And next door to them, their neighbor"
00:17:05,00:17:06,had a tree in their front yard.
00:17:06,00:17:08,And my dad used to love this tree.
00:17:08,00:17:10,"He just used to think, I want one day to have a tree"
00:17:10,00:17:12,in my front yard as well.
00:17:12,00:17:13,And so he went out.
00:17:13,00:17:15,He got really drunk one night.
00:17:15,00:17:17,And he came back.
00:17:17,00:17:19,And he doesn't really remember what happened.
00:17:19,00:17:21,"But in the morning, my mom went outside, opened the doors,"
00:17:21,00:17:25,"and went, Roger, what have you done?"
00:17:25,00:17:27,"And he quickly jumped up, and he saw what he must have done"
00:17:27,00:17:30,"in his drug and state, which is clearly he was walking home."
00:17:30,00:17:33,"He saw the tree, thought, god damn it, I want that tree."
00:17:33,00:17:36,"So he dug it up, and he brought the tree over,"
00:17:36,00:17:39,and he planted it in our front yard.
00:17:39,00:17:39,No way.
00:17:39,00:17:43,But what he had failed to do was to cover up his tracks.
00:17:43,00:17:46,So he saw the tree planted beautifully in our yard
00:17:46,00:17:48,with a huge trail of debris and dirt
00:17:48,00:17:53,leading to a gigantic hole sitting in our neighbor's front yard.
00:17:53,00:17:54,Amazing.
00:17:54,00:17:56,"Do you know what I think, actually, even without that trail"
00:17:56,00:17:58,"of earth, your neighbor might have just"
00:17:58,00:18:00,about figured out when we're going on there?
00:18:00,00:18:01,I know.
00:18:01,00:18:03,I know that swing.
00:18:03,00:18:07,"You're saying that your dad, when drunk, on his way home,"
00:18:07,00:18:11,"dug up a tree, presumably he was just on his way home,"
00:18:11,00:18:12,so he wasn't carrying his spade with him.
00:18:12,00:18:15,"So the implication is, he dug it up with his bare hands."
00:18:15,00:18:18,"Also, I can only imagine Dan's dad likes trees"
00:18:18,00:18:20,"that are tree size, so it must be pretty big, right?"
00:18:20,00:18:23,"So he dug out this tree, all he thought of that tree"
00:18:23,00:18:25,"went home, got the spade."
00:18:25,00:18:28,"Well, home was just next door, so it was very convenient."
00:18:28,00:18:33,"He could have dug it up with a cart, and he got his cababin."
00:18:33,00:18:34,Yes.
00:18:34,00:18:34,You're right.
00:18:34,00:18:37,"It was in Australia, Hong Kong, sorry."
00:18:37,00:18:41,"Hong Kong, all cabab cartons are made of reinforced steel"
00:18:41,00:18:43,in case of burning your hands.
00:18:43,00:18:44,"By the way, he put the tree back,"
00:18:44,00:18:47,so no one needs suppressed criminal charges or anything.
00:18:47,00:18:49,"I don't know if the guy ever noticed, by the way."
00:18:49,00:18:51,"My mom woke up really early in the morning,"
00:18:51,00:18:52,unless he was a very late riser.
00:18:52,00:18:54,I think he probably noticed.
00:18:54,00:18:57,So your dad may be replanted it before this guy woke up?
00:18:57,00:18:58,"Yes, I have."
00:18:58,00:19:01,"He may be wake-up, he's like, this is orientated."
00:19:01,00:19:03,Just slightly different.
00:19:03,00:19:06,That swing was on the other side.
00:19:06,00:19:09,That poor guy is a mental help from the rest of his life.
00:19:09,00:19:11,Just had a nervous breakdown.
00:19:11,00:19:13,He actually invented the character of Groot
00:19:13,00:19:17,for the Guardians of the Galaxy film about a mischievous tree.
00:19:17,00:19:20,"Just quickly, while we're talking about moving trees,"
00:19:20,00:19:24,"whether illegally or legally or with a polystyrene carton,"
00:19:24,00:19:26,"if you don't have a polystyrene carton down,"
00:19:26,00:19:27,"you can get these unbelievably cool things,"
00:19:27,00:19:29,and they're called tree spades.
00:19:29,00:19:32,"So they're these massive boxes, right?"
00:19:32,00:19:34,They look like a big space egg.
00:19:34,00:19:36,And you surround the tree with it.
00:19:36,00:19:38,I don't know quite where you uncouple it
00:19:38,00:19:39,and surround the tree.
00:19:39,00:19:43,And then what it does is it has these massive round-edged blades
00:19:43,00:19:46,"which dig into the ground, very carefully lift up"
00:19:46,00:19:49,"the entire tree, roots and everything."
00:19:49,00:19:51,And then they can tilt it sideways
00:19:51,00:19:54,"and put it onto, for example, the side of a van or whatever."
00:19:54,00:19:55,That's so cool.
00:19:55,00:19:57,"Or probably on the back of a van, not the side of a van."
00:19:57,00:19:59,"Yeah, yeah."
00:19:59,00:19:59,That's amazing.
00:19:59,00:20:02,That sounds like it's given it a pot.
00:20:02,00:20:03,Like it's the egg shape underneath.
00:20:03,00:20:05,It's just created the pot for a standard.
00:20:05,00:20:07,And the really cool thing is they've been doing this
00:20:07,00:20:10,"for hundreds of years, or at least, I think, 150 years,"
00:20:10,00:20:11,"as they were doing this in Brooklyn,"
00:20:11,00:20:13,but just without the big mechanical element.
00:20:13,00:20:15,"But they still had these cool devices, too."
00:20:15,00:20:18,"So without the mechanical element, it's just a spade."
00:20:18,00:20:21,"Well, yeah, they have spades."
00:20:21,00:20:22,"They have spades, the other spades."
00:20:22,00:20:24,The spades goes back 150 years.
00:20:24,00:20:25,Not a lot of people know that.
00:20:25,00:20:27,"No, they have these big tree-moving wagons."
00:20:27,00:20:28,"Oh, right."
00:20:28,00:20:29,Yeah.
00:20:29,00:20:31,"So they put them onto the wagon sideways, do they?"
00:20:31,00:20:32,Yeah.
00:20:32,00:20:35,"The Prime Minister of George, or the ex-Prime Minister of George,"
00:20:35,00:20:35,it didn't do that.
00:20:35,00:20:38,He sent his sticking upwards.
00:20:38,00:20:39,No.
00:20:39,00:20:41,"Yeah, so there's some amazing pictures online."
00:20:41,00:20:43,I'll try and put them on my Twitter.
00:20:43,00:20:47,There's one where he has a tree on a kind of a raft.
00:20:47,00:20:50,"And he's taking it on the black sea, and it's just sticking up."
00:20:50,00:20:51,That's the way it is.
00:20:51,00:20:52,They look incredible.
00:20:52,00:20:53,You should look at the pictures.
00:20:53,00:20:53,Incredible.
00:20:53,00:20:55,"If you took it from someone's land,"
00:20:55,00:20:57,you wouldn't necessarily know he was stealing it.
00:20:57,00:20:59,"It just might look like, oh, it looks a bit further away today."
00:20:59,00:21:01,I'm sure you'll have it.
00:21:01,00:21:02,Exactly.
00:21:02,00:21:04,"So then he took them along the coastline of the black sea,"
00:21:04,00:21:07,but the coastline of the black sea is really shallow.
00:21:07,00:21:08,And so he got stuck there.
00:21:08,00:21:13,And so he then had to make a new road to take a trail on.
00:21:13,00:21:15,And then that road collapsed.
00:21:15,00:21:17,So he had to make a new road.
00:21:17,00:21:20,"And also, one time he took a tree on the highway,"
00:21:20,00:21:22,and it was a magnolia tree.
00:21:22,00:21:25,"And when he was taking it, it got stuck on a eucalyptus tree"
00:21:25,00:21:27,"that was growing on the side of the road, so it's kind of angled."
00:21:27,00:21:29,Did it take the eucalyptus tree with it?
00:21:29,00:21:31,Was it just like a tree chain?
00:21:31,00:21:34,"I don't buy one, get one tree."
00:21:34,00:21:35,He's a hell of a lot of hassle.
00:21:35,00:21:37,"There's a whole bit of it, isn't it?"
00:21:37,00:21:38,"Yeah, his wife's probably saying"
00:21:38,00:21:40,you need to collect something smaller.
00:21:40,00:21:42,Or maybe he's just getting drunk every night
00:21:42,00:21:44,and finding these trees in his garden every night.
00:21:44,00:21:46,[LAUGHTER]
00:21:46,00:21:49,"Just because you mentioned Christmas trees earlier,"
00:21:49,00:21:51,I was reading this amazing story about the Christmas tree
00:21:51,00:21:53,"shipping industry, which used to be huge in the US."
00:21:53,00:21:56,They used to ship hundreds of Christmas trees on ships.
00:21:56,00:22:00,And there was this particular famous ship called the Rouse Simmon Ship.
00:22:00,00:22:03,And it used to carry thousands of trees.
00:22:03,00:22:08,"And then in 1912, it had this very famous accident, and it sank."
00:22:08,00:22:11,"So it was carrying 5,500 trees from Michigan to Chicago,"
00:22:11,00:22:13,across Lake Michigan.
00:22:13,00:22:14,"And it was captain by this guy called Sherman,"
00:22:14,00:22:17,who was so famous as a Christmas tree importer
00:22:17,00:22:20,that people called him Captain Santa.
00:22:20,00:22:23,And he used to go-- he used to land in Chicago.
00:22:23,00:22:25,And he really liked giving out Christmas trees to the poor
00:22:25,00:22:27,and people who couldn't afford Christmas.
00:22:27,00:22:27,What do you know?
00:22:27,00:22:30,"It doesn't quite make sense, because Santa arrives"
00:22:30,00:22:32,after the tree has been sorted out.
00:22:32,00:22:34,"Basically, Santa doesn't bring the tree down the chimney."
00:22:34,00:22:37,Maybe Captain Santa comes and sorts that out.
00:22:37,00:22:39,"Santa's like Santa's boss, isn't it?"
00:22:39,00:22:42,Santa just left ten and Santa is his full size.
00:22:42,00:22:44,They should give him his full title.
00:22:44,00:22:47,It's very confusing and that's so cool.
00:22:47,00:22:49,So Captain Santa used to do this.
00:22:49,00:22:52,"And then there was this awful, there's a storm that sunk the whole ship"
00:22:52,00:22:55,and it killed everyone on board and all the trees sunk.
00:22:55,00:22:57,"So for years, afterwards, fishermen on Lake Michigan"
00:22:57,00:23:02,would catch huge Christmas tree catch.
00:23:02,00:23:05,"What I quite like is, first of all, his business partner,"
00:23:05,00:23:06,"who would always wait in Chicago with him,"
00:23:06,00:23:10,"was called Claude Winters, quite nice numbers of determinism."
00:23:10,00:23:12,"Wow, yeah, and also Captain Santa Claude Winters."
00:23:12,00:23:15,It's one letter away from Santa Claude's Winters.
00:23:15,00:23:16,"Yes, yeah."
00:23:16,00:23:17,OK.
00:23:17,00:23:21,"Anyway, just the other bizarre thing about this accident"
00:23:21,00:23:24,was that the Captain Santa left a message in a bottle
00:23:24,00:23:26,when he knew the ship was in trouble.
00:23:26,00:23:29,And he corked it using the small piece of a cut pine tree
00:23:29,00:23:31,from one of the trees that was on board.
00:23:31,00:23:33,And he left this message and it got picked up.
00:23:33,00:23:36,"And the message just said, everybody, goodbye."
00:23:36,00:23:40,I guess we are all through leaking bad God help us.
00:23:40,00:23:44,"Leaking bad, that sounds like a new Netflix show, doesn't it?"
00:23:44,00:23:45,It's about the White House.
00:23:45,00:23:55,"OK, it is time for fact number three."
00:23:55,00:23:56,And that is my fact.
00:23:56,00:24:00,My fact this week is that US military medics
00:24:00,00:24:03,use longer needles than normal because soldiers
00:24:03,00:24:06,are often too buff for the regular ones.
00:24:06,00:24:09,I think this sounds like a boast by the American army.
00:24:09,00:24:11,"Yeah, it does, doesn't it?"
00:24:11,00:24:13,"Yeah, you should see the size of our condoms."
00:24:13,00:24:16,It's just a bit too convenient.
00:24:16,00:24:18,"And it's a common thing, isn't it, in armies,"
00:24:18,00:24:21,that they send like enormous condoms.
00:24:21,00:24:22,"We saw Jimmy Carter the other day,"
00:24:22,00:24:24,and he told us that story about Churchill.
00:24:24,00:24:25,"Oh, yeah."
00:24:25,00:24:29,There was a gun where they had a sheath kind of thing put over it.
00:24:29,00:24:30,And it was made by Jurex.
00:24:30,00:24:34,"And so it was like a condom, but it was the size of a machine gun."
00:24:34,00:24:36,It was the stop the gun jamming or freezing.
00:24:36,00:24:37,"Yeah, that's right."
00:24:37,00:24:41,And so what they did was they got a big consignment of them.
00:24:41,00:24:44,"And then Churchill supposedly said, well, let's label it"
00:24:44,00:24:45,to British condoms small.
00:24:45,00:24:49,So let me give you a bit of background of where
00:24:49,00:24:50,I got this fact from.
00:24:50,00:24:54,I'm reading a really good book called Grunt by Mary Roach.
00:24:54,00:24:56,And she went round looking at all innovations
00:24:56,00:25:00,going on in the military and classic Mary Roach investigation
00:25:00,00:25:03,"finding out very much what we love, you know,"
00:25:03,00:25:05,the quirky facts about certain things.
00:25:05,00:25:06,So this book's military.
00:25:06,00:25:08,And she spent time with a bunch of medics.
00:25:08,00:25:12,And this was told to her that basically a lot of the soldiers
00:25:12,00:25:16,"are so muscular, particularly around the pecs."
00:25:16,00:25:18,And they often need to give them injections
00:25:18,00:25:20,when they're out in the field for collapse lungs.
00:25:20,00:25:23,And they were finding in autopsy's when they were doing it
00:25:23,00:25:27,"later because in autopsy's, they all get an autopsy."
00:25:27,00:25:29,Any soldier that dies gets an autopsy
00:25:29,00:25:31,when they were going to check out the collapse lung
00:25:31,00:25:33,"and putting the needles in, none of them were reaching."
00:25:33,00:25:35,"And they thought, this is no use for the field."
00:25:35,00:25:38,"So needles, I don't know if it's all the needles,"
00:25:38,00:25:39,but certainly there's a lot of needles
00:25:39,00:25:41,that are extra-large long needles.
00:25:41,00:25:42,That's amazing.
00:25:42,00:25:43,Yeah.
00:25:43,00:25:46,"They also have to make bigger needles for obese people,"
00:25:46,00:25:46,I think.
00:25:46,00:25:47,"Do they, right?"
00:25:47,00:25:51,They did a study with some obese people.
00:25:51,00:25:54,They put the needles into their buttocks
00:25:54,00:25:57,to see if the stuff would get to the muscles.
00:25:57,00:26:00,"And they found that, in less than a third of the patients,"
00:26:00,00:26:03,what they injected was getting through to where it needed to be.
00:26:03,00:26:06,"So they need to start making needles, which are now longer"
00:26:06,00:26:07,for obese people as well.
00:26:07,00:26:09,Terrible if you've got a fear of needles.
00:26:09,00:26:10,Yeah.
00:26:10,00:26:13,"Although, so a good way of combating a fear of needles"
00:26:13,00:26:14,has just been developed.
00:26:14,00:26:18,It's never have any Western medicine.
00:26:18,00:26:19,"Because if you get acupuncture,"
00:26:19,00:26:22,you've really gone through to that.
00:26:22,00:26:23,"No, if you've got a fear of needles,"
00:26:23,00:26:25,"scientists have developed this thing, which"
00:26:25,00:26:27,is a pill that's covered in needles that you swallow
00:26:27,00:26:29,and that injects you from the inside.
00:26:29,00:26:29,What?
00:26:29,00:26:30,And that has to get you over it.
00:26:30,00:26:31,And this is really cool.
00:26:31,00:26:33,So I think this has been tested.
00:26:33,00:26:35,"It was tested on pigs the last time I read about it,"
00:26:35,00:26:36,but it might have been updated.
00:26:36,00:26:38,And it was to administer insulin.
00:26:38,00:26:40,"And basically, it's these little pills"
00:26:40,00:26:42,and they cover them in tiny needles.
00:26:42,00:26:44,And then they have an outer coating of the pill.
00:26:44,00:26:46,"And when the pill gets into your stomach,"
00:26:46,00:26:48,then the outer coating of the pill dissolves.
00:26:48,00:26:51,And all these tiny needles prod the lining of your stomach.
00:26:51,00:26:53,And they administer the drug straight into your bloodstream.
00:26:53,00:26:57,But do you have to pass the needles out later on?
00:26:57,00:26:57,I think so.
00:26:57,00:27:00,"But we're talking, like, one millimeter, less than a millimeter."
00:27:00,00:27:01,I don't know.
00:27:01,00:27:03,That still sounds painful.
00:27:03,00:27:05,Maybe they dissolve.
00:27:05,00:27:06,Maybe they do dissolve.
00:27:06,00:27:08,"Yeah, they're really tiny."
00:27:08,00:27:10,"Well, here-- OK, here's a less painful one"
00:27:10,00:27:14,if you don't want to swallow needles.
00:27:14,00:27:16,This is-- this is used.
00:27:16,00:27:18,I don't know if it's-- if it was-- this is just the trial I
00:27:18,00:27:20,"was reading about, but they definitely have developed this."
00:27:20,00:27:22,And it has been used.
00:27:22,00:27:23,"So instead of having a morphine needle,"
00:27:23,00:27:27,"let's say, in order to numb you, you can, instead, now,"
00:27:27,00:27:28,have a lollipop.
00:27:28,00:27:30,"Wow, sticking it into your--"
00:27:30,00:27:33,"No, yeah, that sounds like it'd be more painful"
00:27:33,00:27:34,than it would be in many ways.
00:27:34,00:27:38,I would rather have morphine if I were in pain than a lollipop.
00:27:38,00:27:39,"Well, actually, on any day of the week,"
00:27:39,00:27:41,I'd rather have morphine than a lollipop.
00:27:41,00:27:42,"Interesting, it's okay."
00:27:42,00:27:45,"It's not your classic lollipop, obviously."
00:27:45,00:27:49,It's-- they call it the fentanyl lollipop.
00:27:49,00:27:51,And it's basically the drug.
00:27:51,00:27:53,So it's got a drug in the lollipop.
00:27:53,00:27:56,"You eat it, and it absorbs through the tongue and the mouth."
00:27:56,00:27:58,"And that's really fast, apparently."
00:27:58,00:28:00,So it spreads really quickly.
00:28:00,00:28:02,And they can also tell when you've had too much.
00:28:02,00:28:03,So because you're sucking--
00:28:03,00:28:05,"Because you're going, then, then, then, then, then, then."
00:28:05,00:28:06,Exactly.
00:28:06,00:28:07,Because if it does go into--
00:28:07,00:28:10,"it's a painkiller, it first goes into your tongue."
00:28:10,00:28:11,"It's going to be like at the dentist, isn't it, where"
00:28:11,00:28:12,you can't talk?
00:28:12,00:28:13,"Yes, exactly."
00:28:13,00:28:15,It must numb your tongue.
00:28:15,00:28:18,"But they can, obviously, if they see that enough of the drug"
00:28:18,00:28:19,"has been put into the patient, they"
00:28:19,00:28:22,can stop putting more by simply just taking the lollipop away.
00:28:22,00:28:23,"Yeah, that one."
00:28:23,00:28:26,And then you're just going to be crying.
00:28:26,00:28:29,Because there was an art installation once
00:28:29,00:28:32,of a guy who gave babies lollipops
00:28:32,00:28:35,and then took them off them and took photos of them crying.
00:28:35,00:28:36,"Oh, yeah."
00:28:36,00:28:37,That's quite controversial.
00:28:37,00:28:40,"Well, unsurprisingly."
00:28:40,00:28:41,"Oh, surprisingly."
00:28:41,00:28:43,Have you had one of these lollipops?
00:28:44,00:28:45,Yeah.
00:28:45,00:28:49,Do you know where the word syringe comes from?
00:28:49,00:28:55,"Syring's is a thing in a bird, which makes it like a larynx."
00:28:55,00:28:56,Is it from that?
00:28:56,00:28:58,It is from the word syring's.
00:28:58,00:29:00,But I didn't know that bird thing.
00:29:00,00:29:02,Because syring's was in Greek mythology.
00:29:02,00:29:04,"She was-- no, he-- look, she--"
00:29:04,00:29:07,Syring's-- she was a name.
00:29:07,00:29:09,"And she was being chased by the god Pan, right?"
00:29:09,00:29:13,And then she disguised herself as some water reads.
00:29:13,00:29:15,"OK, clever, but not clever enough."
00:29:15,00:29:18,Because Pan then chopped the reads off
00:29:18,00:29:20,and blew into them to make a whistling sound.
00:29:20,00:29:23,And that's where he got his pan pipes.
00:29:23,00:29:26,But it's also where the word syringe was taken from.
00:29:26,00:29:28,"Because you know, it's a long thing tube of something."
00:29:28,00:29:31,That must be where the syring's of or a syring
00:29:31,00:29:34,so the bird comes from because it's the whistling sound.
00:29:34,00:29:36,And that's what they used to make their tweets.
00:29:36,00:29:38,There we go.
00:29:38,00:29:40,I have some things on mussels.
00:29:40,00:29:41,"Oh, cool, yeah."
00:29:41,00:29:46,So there's a guy called Zhang Jingquan in China
00:29:46,00:29:50,who holds a world record for pulling the largest vehicle
00:29:50,00:29:53,"by pressing a rice bowl onto his abdominal mussels,"
00:29:53,00:29:56,"creating a suction, and then attaching it to a vehicle"
00:29:56,00:29:57,and pulling it.
00:29:57,00:29:58,How large was the vehicle?
00:29:58,00:30:03,"It was 3,305.5 kilograms."
00:30:03,00:30:05,And he pulled it for 10 meters.
00:30:05,00:30:07,Wow.
00:30:07,00:30:09,"Just through suction, that adhered."
00:30:09,00:30:11,It adhered to his muscular abdomen.
00:30:11,00:30:13,"I would have thought that they would always,"
00:30:13,00:30:16,because you're not flat enough to be able to put the suction
00:30:16,00:30:17,on the floor.
00:30:17,00:30:18,I'm Zhang Jingquan's.
00:30:18,00:30:20,I'm really impressed by that.
00:30:20,00:30:21,That's incredible.
00:30:21,00:30:23,I think he did it to impress people.
00:30:23,00:30:23,Did it--
00:30:23,00:30:25,It's worked like a trial.
00:30:25,00:30:27,"It's half worked, I'd say, Anna."
00:30:27,00:30:28,And then it's worked on you.
00:30:28,00:30:29,I'm not impressed.
00:30:29,00:30:30,You're not impressed.
00:30:30,00:30:30,"No, no."
00:30:30,00:30:36,He's pulled a three-ton vehicle using suction on his abdomen.
00:30:36,00:30:38,I think that's a very bad way of trying to pass
00:30:38,00:30:39,your driving test.
00:30:39,00:30:41,I think if I need--
00:30:41,00:30:42,"I told you, he wasn't trying to do that."
00:30:42,00:30:43,He was trying to impress people.
00:30:43,00:30:44,"Oh, I see."
00:30:44,00:30:45,"Well, he hasn't done that either."
00:30:45,00:30:46,OK.
00:30:46,00:30:49,"Did you guys know, one fact about the US military?"
00:30:49,00:30:50,"Yeah, sure."
00:30:50,00:30:52,And their pens?
00:30:52,00:30:54,Do you know they all use the same pen?
00:30:54,00:30:55,Just the one is so annoying.
00:30:55,00:30:57,They're sharing this.
00:30:57,00:30:59,"Sorry, General McMaster's got the pen today."
00:30:59,00:31:02,[LAUGHTER]
00:31:02,00:31:04,"Do you mean pen as a thing you write with,"
00:31:04,00:31:05,or that you keep animals in?
00:31:05,00:31:08,[LAUGHTER]
00:31:08,00:31:09,"Yeah, the pen they write with it's"
00:31:09,00:31:11,called a Skillcraft pen.
00:31:11,00:31:13,"It's the same company that's been making their pen since,"
00:31:13,00:31:16,"I think, the 1920s."
00:31:16,00:31:17,"But apparently, every American listening"
00:31:17,00:31:19,will apparently know what it is.
00:31:19,00:31:20,It's used in war zones.
00:31:20,00:31:23,It's designed to fit into US military uniforms.
00:31:23,00:31:24,And--
00:31:24,00:31:25,[LAUGHTER]
00:31:25,00:31:27,It's designed not to be so impossibly large
00:31:27,00:31:30,that it doesn't fit into a normal human pocket.
00:31:30,00:31:31,All right.
00:31:31,00:31:32,Yeah.
00:31:32,00:31:35,So they've got this pen that fits snugly into their uniforms.
00:31:35,00:31:38,It's so quickly designed that it can do that.
00:31:38,00:31:41,It can stand in for a two-inch fuse.
00:31:41,00:31:42,"Apparently, it's designed for that."
00:31:42,00:31:43,I don't know how a pen does that.
00:31:43,00:31:44,What?
00:31:44,00:31:47,"It comes in handy during emergency tracky otomies, which"
00:31:47,00:31:48,I think a lot of people can do that.
00:31:48,00:31:50,"No, pens can't do that, you know?"
00:31:50,00:31:51,Oh!
00:31:51,00:31:53,"Yeah, there's a study done in actually most pens"
00:31:53,00:31:55,are not suitable for tracky otomies.
00:31:55,00:31:56,"Well, guys, you better get the Skillcraft"
00:31:56,00:31:58,if you feel like you're going to need one.
00:31:58,00:31:59,So is it where you put a pen--
00:31:59,00:32:01,"OK, a pen at work?"
00:32:01,00:32:02,"Yeah, you'll see it moving sometimes."
00:32:02,00:32:04,"Someone's choking, and then someone goes,"
00:32:04,00:32:06,"ah, I'm a surgeon."
00:32:06,00:32:08,"And here's a biro, and I'll stick it in your neck."
00:32:08,00:32:10,And you can breathe through the pen kind of thing.
00:32:10,00:32:12,"But anyway, if you're ever in that situation,"
00:32:12,00:32:13,it probably won't work.
00:32:13,00:32:15,"Oh, but it would have been stabbed in the neck."
00:32:15,00:32:19,Unless you have one of these special Skillcrafts.
00:32:19,00:32:19,Exactly.
00:32:19,00:32:22,"Anyway, more legends about this pen."
00:32:22,00:32:24,So the main thing about it is they're all manufactured
00:32:24,00:32:25,by blind workers.
00:32:25,00:32:28,"So it was set up, I think, during the Great Depression,"
00:32:28,00:32:30,as a way of giving work to people who would otherwise
00:32:30,00:32:32,find it really difficult to find work.
00:32:32,00:32:34,So everyone who works in the factory
00:32:34,00:32:36,makes this doesn't have sight.
00:32:36,00:32:39,And there are 16 page specifications
00:32:39,00:32:41,for exactly what the pen has to be able to do.
00:32:41,00:32:43,"It needs to be able to write continuously for a mile,"
00:32:43,00:32:46,and in temperatures of up to 160 degrees
00:32:46,00:32:48,and down to minus 40 degrees.
00:32:48,00:32:50,All quite important for the army.
00:32:50,00:32:52,If you've got secret messages that you need to get--
00:32:52,00:32:54,"I don't know when you're going to be in the army,"
00:32:54,00:32:56,and you have to write a line that's a mile long.
00:32:56,00:32:59,"Well, maybe you need to show your troops the ways"
00:32:59,00:33:00,of the nearest base.
00:33:00,00:33:03,"Yeah, it's a mile away."
00:33:03,00:33:05,"Wow, that sounds amazing."
00:33:05,00:33:07,It's surrounded by legend.
00:33:07,00:33:08,"Apparently, the length of the pen"
00:33:08,00:33:12,is equivalent to 150 nautical miles on Navy maps.
00:33:12,00:33:15,And that makes it easy for people in the Navy
00:33:15,00:33:17,"to navigate, because they use that pen,"
00:33:17,00:33:20,and they know that that equals 150 miles on the map.
00:33:20,00:33:22,"I mean, they could just look at the scale of the map."
00:33:22,00:33:23,But sometimes--
00:33:23,00:33:26,"Because 150-- if it was 100, I could see that almost."
00:33:26,00:33:28,But 150 isn't that round the number.
00:33:28,00:33:29,Do you know what I mean?
00:33:29,00:33:30,"But they need to take, like, mentally alert."
00:33:30,00:33:34,So it's important to test their math skills at the same time.
00:33:34,00:33:36,"But presumably, they're two inches long,"
00:33:36,00:33:39,because they can be used as a two-inch fuse.
00:33:39,00:33:42,"Yeah, maybe there's a bit that's detachable."
00:33:42,00:33:45,"But actually, two inches is quite a small pen."
00:33:45,00:33:46,75 centimeters long.
00:33:46,00:33:47,And that obviously would fit snugly
00:33:47,00:33:50,inside the average soldier's uniform.
00:33:50,00:33:54,"5 centimeters is about that long, which is a short pen."
00:33:54,00:33:55,That is.
00:33:55,00:33:59,"It's like a labbrox pen, or an agus pen."
00:33:59,00:34:01,"Yeah, agus pencil, yeah."
00:34:01,00:34:02,So they're not that short.
00:34:02,00:34:04,It must be a detachable bit.
00:34:04,00:34:04,OK.
00:34:04,00:34:05,OK.
00:34:05,00:34:07,And you just thought I wanted to know about the SkullCraft pen.
00:34:07,00:34:08,That's great.
00:34:08,00:34:09,Very cool.
00:34:09,00:34:11,I have one more thing about needles.
00:34:11,00:34:14,So you know how mosquitoes bite you?
00:34:14,00:34:15,"Yeah, yeah."
00:34:15,00:34:20,"They've got six different needles, which I didn't know."
00:34:20,00:34:23,"Yeah, so they have this really complicated multi-part drill"
00:34:23,00:34:23,bit.
00:34:23,00:34:26,So they have two which drill through the skin.
00:34:26,00:34:30,They have two more which hold the edges of your skin apart.
00:34:30,00:34:34,And there's a fifth one which drops saliva into you to stop
00:34:34,00:34:35,your blood clotting.
00:34:35,00:34:38,And then there's the sixth one which actually sucks the blood up.
00:34:38,00:34:40,But that's not even the cool thing.
00:34:40,00:34:43,The cool thing is how much volume would you say of blood?
00:34:43,00:34:45,Mosquito can fit inside it.
00:34:45,00:34:47,"Well, the hand gesture you're making"
00:34:47,00:34:49,is about large melon size.
00:34:49,00:34:51,"OK, so how much is the mosquito?"
00:34:51,00:34:55,"Yeah, so I would say it could fill 50% of its body."
00:34:55,00:34:58,"50% of its body, OK?"
00:34:58,00:34:58,Four-year-old child.
00:34:58,00:34:59,OK.
00:34:59,00:35:05,So if you look at ticks on--
00:35:05,00:35:06,"Yeah, yeah."
00:35:06,00:35:07,They can get much bigger.
00:35:07,00:35:09,"Then they get about 1,000% of their own body."
00:35:09,00:35:11,"Well, here's what the mosquito says."
00:35:11,00:35:14,Mosquitoes can fit 10 times as much blood into them
00:35:14,00:35:16,as the size of a mosquito.
00:35:16,00:35:17,Not through swelling up.
00:35:17,00:35:18,Wow.
00:35:18,00:35:21,"What they do is, as her gut fills up,"
00:35:21,00:35:25,the female mosquito separates the water in the blood she's
00:35:25,00:35:27,sucking up from the actual red blood cells.
00:35:27,00:35:31,And she squeezes the water out of her bottom
00:35:31,00:35:32,"so she can fit more red blood cells, which"
00:35:32,00:35:34,is the good stuff that you can get.
00:35:34,00:35:36,"So does that mean that when a mosquito's biting you,"
00:35:36,00:35:39,it's also pissing?
00:35:39,00:35:40,"Well, it's your blood, though."
00:35:40,00:35:41,"It's the water from your blood, then."
00:35:41,00:35:42,"Yeah, but it doesn't matter where--"
00:35:42,00:35:44,"When you're at 80, it doesn't matter."
00:35:44,00:35:45,"It's like, no, this isn't urine,"
00:35:45,00:35:47,"because I was drinking orange juice earlier, right?"
00:35:47,00:35:52,"Yeah, it's orange juice officer."
00:35:52,00:35:53,It's just orange juice I'm pouring away here.
00:35:53,00:35:56,Please tell the rest of me.
00:35:56,00:35:58,"Also, at that point, is it a mosquito"
00:35:58,00:36:01,"with blood in it, or is it a lot of blood?"
00:36:01,00:36:03,It's with a mosquito around it.
00:36:03,00:36:04,It's actually both.
00:36:04,00:36:04,Is it?
00:36:04,00:36:05,Yeah.
00:36:05,00:36:08,[MUSIC PLAYING]
00:36:08,00:36:13,"OK, it is time for our final fact of the show."
00:36:13,00:36:15,And that is Chazinski.
00:36:15,00:36:19,My fact is that if you drew a dot in indelible ink
00:36:19,00:36:21,"on your eardrum, it would appear on the outside of your ear"
00:36:21,00:36:23,within a few weeks.
00:36:23,00:36:25,Are you using the skill craft pen?
00:36:25,00:36:27,So beloved by the US Army.
00:36:27,00:36:28,"Yeah, also--"
00:36:28,00:36:30,I was just thinking the skill craft pen would be good
00:36:30,00:36:34,if you wanted to put it in the cloaca of chickens.
00:36:34,00:36:37,Specifically designed to fit in the chicken cloaca.
00:36:37,00:36:38,Yeah.
00:36:38,00:36:39,And in a human ear.
00:36:39,00:36:42,"And also, a chickens cloaca, if you put it on a map,"
00:36:42,00:36:46,it's exactly 150 kilopters.
00:36:46,00:36:48,If you don't have your pen.
00:36:48,00:36:50,But it messes up the map.
00:36:50,00:36:52,Where's the hazard work?
00:36:52,00:36:52,What do you mean?
00:36:52,00:36:53,It's amazing.
00:36:53,00:36:56,So the way the eardrum works is that the skin
00:36:56,00:36:58,"grows outwards in a spiral, because it"
00:36:58,00:37:02,"needs to carry dead skin out away from the eardrum,"
00:37:02,00:37:04,and then to the outside world where it falls off.
00:37:04,00:37:09,"And it grows at about the same rate as fingernails, I think."
00:37:09,00:37:11,And so the skin starts off in your eardrum.
00:37:11,00:37:14,"And then it's carried out, picks up earwax, picks up all the dust,"
00:37:14,00:37:16,"transports it outside the ear, falls out."
00:37:16,00:37:20,"Same speed as continent's move, because they always say"
00:37:20,00:37:22,"that's the same as a fingernail, don't they?"
00:37:22,00:37:23,They do.
00:37:23,00:37:26,"Wait, so-- and also, it's a bit like a conveyor belt system?"
00:37:26,00:37:27,Exactly.
00:37:27,00:37:29,And it's all the skin on your body.
00:37:29,00:37:30,Does that originate in the ear?
00:37:30,00:37:33,Or does it-- does it start?
00:37:33,00:37:36,Is there a barrier where it stops growing outwards?
00:37:36,00:37:39,"If you drew a little start on your eardrum,"
00:37:39,00:37:43,then it just moves around the body.
00:37:43,00:37:48,You'd have it if you want to get a tattoo very slowly.
00:37:48,00:37:49,How did you get that--
00:37:49,00:37:51,I'm not saying that the body is built
00:37:51,00:37:53,from the earwax.
00:37:53,00:37:55,"It just falls off, and you leave it behind."
00:37:55,00:37:57,But it must fall off at a certain point.
00:37:57,00:37:58,Yeah.
00:37:58,00:38:00,How far out of your ear before it falls off?
00:38:00,00:38:03,On your foot.
00:38:03,00:38:06,"At the end of the big toe, it falls off."
00:38:06,00:38:09,That's why your socks are always full of loose skin.
00:38:09,00:38:10,With dots on them.
00:38:10,00:38:12,That's right.
00:38:12,00:38:15,"No, actually, most of it is reabsorbed, actually."
00:38:15,00:38:17,I think most earwax is reabsorbed back into the body
00:38:17,00:38:19,before it reaches the outside.
00:38:19,00:38:21,"So I'm confused about this, because obviously,"
00:38:21,00:38:22,"you get earwax in the ears, and this"
00:38:22,00:38:25,is related to the ear drum.
00:38:25,00:38:26,"Yes, so--"
00:38:26,00:38:26,Is it reduced at the ear drum?
00:38:26,00:38:27,It waxes.
00:38:27,00:38:29,But ear wax is actually mostly dead skin.
00:38:29,00:38:30,Yeah.
00:38:30,00:38:31,"Oh, it is."
00:38:31,00:38:31,OK.
00:38:31,00:38:33,"That's what was confusing me, because yeah,"
00:38:33,00:38:35,I didn't know what it was made of.
00:38:35,00:38:36,"So it's got this kind of waxy stuff,"
00:38:36,00:38:39,but it's basically the big mass of it
00:38:39,00:38:41,is bits of dead skin from your ear drum.
00:38:41,00:38:44,"So it's produced by these glands inside your ear,"
00:38:44,00:38:46,which I think are in the sort of outer ear.
00:38:46,00:38:47,"So the dead skin spirals up a bit,"
00:38:47,00:38:51,and then picks up the sticky substance from these glands.
00:38:51,00:38:53,"And it's got like fatty acids in it,"
00:38:53,00:38:55,"it's got cholesterol in it, other fats."
00:38:55,00:38:57,And it also has alcohol in it.
00:38:57,00:39:00,So I really wanted to find out what the exact alcohol content
00:39:00,00:39:03,"of earwax was, and then work out the equivalent of a pine."
00:39:03,00:39:04,"Yeah, I can't."
00:39:04,00:39:05,How much earwax would you have to eat
00:39:05,00:39:07,before you went over the legal limit?
00:39:07,00:39:08,Yeah.
00:39:08,00:39:10,"Oh, poor policeman."
00:39:10,00:39:12,Who pulls you over?
00:39:12,00:39:14,You just got a mouthful of earwax.
00:39:14,00:39:15,"You know, those medical trial things"
00:39:15,00:39:18,that people go and do to test things out.
00:39:18,00:39:20,Imagine being that the gig you get.
00:39:20,00:39:22,How much would they have to pay you
00:39:22,00:39:24,to agree to eat enough earwax to get you drunk?
00:39:24,00:39:26,"Well, we don't know how much it is, you see."
00:39:26,00:39:29,"For all we know, it's just like one little tiny bit of earwax"
00:39:29,00:39:31,is enough to put you over the limit.
00:39:31,00:39:33,Let's say that's a sharp glass full of earwax.
00:39:33,00:39:34,Right.
00:39:34,00:39:35,Absolutely.
00:39:35,00:39:38,"Well, I'll negotiate, but I'll start at 10,000."
00:39:38,00:39:39,"10,000?"
00:39:39,00:39:40,Yeah.
00:39:40,00:39:41,"I'll do it for probably a tenor, come on."
00:39:41,00:39:43,What have I got in there?
00:39:43,00:39:44,I was going in the other direction.
00:39:45,00:39:47,"Kale, we've agreed that my one's the one."
00:39:47,00:39:48,OK.
00:39:48,00:39:50,I think Hannah's currently leading the bed at the moment.
00:39:50,00:39:55,"I reckon we can crowdfot that 10,000, 10 pounds."
00:39:55,00:39:57,And then you can both do it.
00:39:57,00:40:03,So Japanese mothers clean out their kids
00:40:03,00:40:06,"is with these earwax, they're called mini khaki."
00:40:06,00:40:09,"And then when Japanese people grow up,"
00:40:09,00:40:10,they really like the feeling of it.
00:40:10,00:40:12,And so you get ear salons where you go
00:40:12,00:40:13,and you pay quite a lot of money to go and have
00:40:13,00:40:15,"your ears cleaned out, same kind of thing."
00:40:15,00:40:17,"But the thing about this is, if you start,"
00:40:17,00:40:19,"which all of you would have read, when you start looking up,"
00:40:19,00:40:22,"earwax and ears, there's not a single medical professional"
00:40:22,00:40:24,"worldwide who doesn't say straight away,"
00:40:24,00:40:26,do not put anything in your ear.
00:40:26,00:40:28,"It's really, really back to you."
00:40:28,00:40:31,"Yeah, but then weirdly, we're all putting our fingers in our ears"
00:40:31,00:40:32,while we're talking about this.
00:40:32,00:40:33,"Yeah, I mean, you just did it then."
00:40:33,00:40:34,"I did, didn't I?"
00:40:34,00:40:38,I put a finger in my ears whenever any of you talk.
00:40:38,00:40:40,I wonder if people listening to this are also putting
00:40:40,00:40:41,their fingers in their ears.
00:40:41,00:40:44,"And it's a kind of thing that you just automatically do,"
00:40:44,00:40:47,"like, you know, some kind of social things"
00:40:47,00:40:51,"that are catching, you know, like a yarn kind of thing."
00:40:51,00:40:52,"Yeah, I bet."
00:40:52,00:40:53,"I spoke to a doctor once he said,"
00:40:53,00:40:55,"""You should never put anything smaller than a caulge"
00:40:55,00:40:57,"yet in your ear."""
00:40:57,00:41:00,"And the thing was, obviously, you can't fit one of those in,"
00:41:00,00:41:01,but you shouldn't put anything else in.
00:41:01,00:41:03,That is exactly the case.
00:41:03,00:41:06,"That's probably true of most, like, holes in your body."
00:41:06,00:41:10,"You shouldn't put anything smaller than a caulge, actually."
00:41:10,00:41:14,"A couple of years ago, they found a cat abandoned in Norfolk,"
00:41:14,00:41:15,right?
00:41:15,00:41:16,"Some people found it abandoned cat,"
00:41:16,00:41:18,and it had three ears.
00:41:18,00:41:19,Really?
00:41:19,00:41:20,And...
00:41:20,00:41:21,Were they all belonging to it?
00:41:21,00:41:24,"Or had it just eating a mouse, is it?"
00:41:24,00:41:27,"Yeah, this extra ear on its left-hand side"
00:41:27,00:41:29,in front of its other ear.
00:41:29,00:41:31,Can you guess what they consider calling it?
00:41:31,00:41:33,"Oh, um..."
00:41:33,00:41:35,It's really good.
00:41:35,00:41:36,"Okay, ear."
00:41:36,00:41:37,"Ear, kitty, kitty."
00:41:37,00:41:38,That's very good.
00:41:38,00:41:39,That's very good.
00:41:39,00:41:41,"It's ear, kitty, kitty, surely."
00:41:41,00:41:42,"Make sure, yeah."
00:41:42,00:41:44,"Well, no, it'd be ear, ear, ear, kitty."
00:41:44,00:41:46,(LAUGHTER)
00:41:46,00:41:51,Shall I tell you what they called it?
00:41:51,00:41:52,"And then you'll see, if you can guess why,"
00:41:52,00:41:55,they thought about calling it Captain Kirk.
00:41:55,00:41:56,Okay.
00:41:56,00:41:59,Because he had a wild frontier or something.
00:41:59,00:42:00,"It was an old joke, isn't it?"
00:42:00,00:42:02,Where did they go in Star Trek?
00:42:02,00:42:03,A final frontier.
00:42:03,00:42:05,"Yes, it's a final frontier."
00:42:05,00:42:06,"Oh, yeah."
00:42:06,00:42:07,"And they considered calling it that,"
00:42:07,00:42:09,and then they called it Brian.
00:42:09,00:42:12,(LAUGHTER)
00:42:12,00:42:14,After three-aird Brian.
00:42:14,00:42:17,Is that the worst outbreak turn of the name?
00:42:17,00:42:20,(LAUGHTER)
00:42:20,00:42:23,"Speaking of cats, in 1968,"
00:42:23,00:42:26,New York vet Robert A. Lopez wanted to discover
00:42:26,00:42:27,whether it was possible for the ear mite
00:42:27,00:42:31,which you're getting cats to infest humans.
00:42:31,00:42:33,"So he removed some mites from a cat's ear,"
00:42:33,00:42:35,"mixed them with his earwax,"
00:42:35,00:42:39,and then introduced them into his ear.
00:42:39,00:42:41,And it turns out they can infest people's ears.
00:42:41,00:42:44,(LAUGHTER)
00:42:44,00:42:46,Really hoping for a no in this study.
00:42:46,00:42:47,Really hoping for a no in this.
00:42:47,00:42:48,Wow.
00:42:48,00:42:50,So it was extremely painful.
00:42:50,00:42:54,"You know, it was loads of sounds in his ear all the time."
00:42:54,00:42:56,They traveled deeper into his ear drum
00:42:56,00:43:00,and they got louder and louder by the third week.
00:43:00,00:43:02,He was completely deaf in the ear.
00:43:02,00:43:02,"Oh, my God."
00:43:02,00:43:06,"In the fourth week, the mites activity was 75% reduced,"
00:43:06,00:43:07,which is good.
00:43:07,00:43:11,But he could feel the mites crawling across his face at night.
00:43:11,00:43:12,Oh.
00:43:12,00:43:15,On the inside or the outside?
00:43:15,00:43:17,"Across the outside of his face,"
00:43:17,00:43:19,probably trying to find the new ear.
00:43:19,00:43:21,(LAUGHTER)
00:43:21,00:43:22,"Oh, my God."
00:43:22,00:43:25,So he finished that and then did the experiment two more times.
00:43:25,00:43:26,(LAUGHTER)
00:43:26,00:43:28,With his other two ears.
00:43:28,00:43:30,(LAUGHTER)
00:43:30,00:43:33,"And found that the fex diminished,"
00:43:33,00:43:36,which he said that maybe his body found an immune reaction
00:43:36,00:43:37,against the mites.
00:43:37,00:43:38,That's good.
00:43:38,00:43:40,So there are two ways of avoiding suffering
00:43:40,00:43:41,from cat-might infestations.
00:43:41,00:43:44,Either infest yourself repeatedly.
00:43:44,00:43:45,Or just don't do it in the first place.
00:43:45,00:43:47,(LAUGHTER)
00:43:47,00:43:49,"There was a woman who she had a spider in her ear,"
00:43:49,00:43:50,didn't she?
00:43:50,00:43:51,She had a live tarantula in her ear.
00:43:51,00:43:54,"No, you're thinking of the nursery rhyme, I think."
00:43:54,00:43:55,Yeah.
00:43:55,00:43:56,Because it was the fly first.
00:43:56,00:44:00,There was no lady who put a fly in her ear.
00:44:00,00:44:01,I don't know why.
00:44:01,00:44:02,Now she can't hear.
00:44:02,00:44:03,"No, there was."
00:44:03,00:44:06,There was a woman who had a live tarantula removed from her ear.
00:44:06,00:44:09,And she inserted the colljettes to get rid of them.
00:44:09,00:44:10,(LAUGHTER)
00:44:10,00:44:16,"OK, that's it."
00:44:16,00:44:17,That is all of our facts.
