WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
 We run it on QI a few years ago.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:02.000
 Yeah.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
 Which was, there's no such thing as a fish.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
 And it's not such thing as a fish.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
 No, seriously, it's in the Oxford Dictionary of Underwater Life.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
 It says it, right there, first paragraph, no such thing as a fish.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:20.000
 Hello, and welcome to another episode.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
 And no such thing as a fish, a weekly podcast.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
 Coming to you this week from the Aces and Aids Bar in Top No Park.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.000
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
 I am sitting here with Anichesinski, James Harkin.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
 And Annie Murray, this is our Christmas special.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
 And once again, we gathered around the microphones

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
 with our four favorite facts in the last seven days.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
 And in no particular order, here we go.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
 We begin with my fact.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
 My fact this week is that before going on stage to read a Christmas carol,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.000
 Charles Dickens had a warm up routine of drinking a pint of champagne.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
 In the morning when he woke up, he had two tablespoons of rum.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
 He would have the pint of champagne at lunch.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
 And then just before he went on stage, he would have cherry,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
 which he would mix raw egg into.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.000
 Wow.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
 The interesting thing is that you would think,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
 okay, Charles Dickens, he probably did one or two readings of a Christmas carol.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.000
 If you look into his biography, you could almost claim that he was as much a performer as a rider.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
 He spent years as a performer.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
 He would go on massive tours.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
 He was like Michael McIntyre.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
 He was like, properly always on tour.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
 One of his stars in America got him $2.3 million.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.000
 That's how much.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.000
 In today's money.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.000
 Oh, in today's money.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.000
 Oh.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.000
 But so.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
 Another thing he used to do at his tours is hypnotize his wife.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
 And also as a warm up act, I think.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
 Okay, so that was his warm up routine, the warm up act.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.000
 hypnotize his wife.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.000
 He was really in tipnosis.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
 And so he'd bring his wife on stage and show off.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.000
 Wow.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.000
 Yeah.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
 What would he make his wife do?

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
 I think he just made, like, be able to obey him in every way,

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.000
 which maybe she was doing already.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
 But it was the 19th century.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
 So he was really into mesmerism, which I mentioned,

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
 because you, like people whose names,

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
 are directly related to the thing that they created.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.000
 Anton Mesmer came up with mesmerism, which is hypnotism.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
 You know, Mesmer had a big tree in his garden

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
 that people would come and hug.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
 And that's where tree hugging came from.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
 He claimed that he had mesmerised it and made it,

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
 given it some of his hypnotic.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
 He called it animal magnetism, didn't he?

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.000
 Yes, he did.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.000
 Yeah.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
 And he also claimed he had mesmerised the sun.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
 Again, remotely.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
 And he just said, yeah, if you get any sunlight,

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
 you're getting some of my mesmeric power now.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.000
 I mean, he was a charlatan.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.000
 Wow.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
 Charles Dickens, and a Christmas Carol.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.000
 So he made no money from it.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
 In spite of the fact that it was incredibly popular.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
 So within maybe six weeks, there were five different performances

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
 of it on the stage in London, all over London at different theatres.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
 But they had not very good copyright laws.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
 And basically pirates stole pirates.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.000
 Pirates.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.000
 Pirates.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
 19th century is the right time for pirates.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
 No, actual book pirates.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.000
 What am I saying?

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.000
 Copyright pirate.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.000
 It was pirated.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
 That's what I'm looking for.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
 And then he sued the pirates.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
 And I'm going to keep using the word pirates.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
 And they declared themselves bankrupt.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
 So he was left to pay the equivalent of 56,000 pounds

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
 in modern day money in his own legal fees.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
 Because they just sold it immediately.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.000
 So it's quite sad for him.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
 He did have speaking of pirates cowboy connections.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
 Pirates and cowboys are kind of connected right in people's minds.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:27.000
 So what kind of cool murderous figures from history.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:32.000
 So butch Cassidy's grandfather was the basis for Oliver Twist.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.000
 It is thought.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:38.000
 So butch Cassidy's great grandfather went into business with Charles Dickens' father.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
 And it ended up falling apart.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
 They both ended up in prison together.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
 And Charles Dickens grew up saying butch Cassidy's grandfather

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
 they're being a beggar on the streets.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.000
 And Oliver Twist.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.000
 It's thought he based.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
 He based it on butch Cassidy's grandfather.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.000
 It's amazing.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
 For a second, I thought he said he was the basis for Oliver Twist.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.000
 I'm not a band.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
 No, not a band in that.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
 Do you know who Scrooge was based on?

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
 One person they thought it might have been based on Scrooge

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.000
 was a guy called Jimmy Wood.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.000
 And he was a very famous miser back in the day.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.000
 He was such a miser that his coffin was said to be stoned when he died.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
 They all threw stones at him because they hated him so much.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.000
 He once went to Gloucester to Tugesbury and jumped on the back of the hearse

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000
 because he didn't want to pay for a carriage.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.000
 He chose to die because there was a coffin passing by.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
 And he thought, "Now will be a good time to save money."

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:27.000
 And he used to...

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
 Also, if you're stoning somebody's coffin, that's too late.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
 Stoned the ones that...

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:33.000
 Stoned the ones that they're living.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.000
 I don't stoned them at all.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.000
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.000
 That's not advocate.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
 But he also would walk down the docks

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
 and there would be coal ships going past

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
 and he would just grab small bits of coal

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000
 that came off these ships just so they didn't have to pay for them.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.000
 Pay for the coal himself.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
 So he's a real miser and they reckon that.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
 And he's quite famous for it at the time as well.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.000
 Right, okay.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
 Did Dickens actually base Scrooge on a person, though?

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.000
 It might be on him.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
 There's a few other people as well.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.000
 Right, okay.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
 There's a good person called Jasper Packelmerton

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
 who's in the Old Curiosity Shop.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:07.000
 And he killed his 14 wives by tickling them to death.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.000
 And apparently he's based on a real person, amazingly.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.000
 Based on an article in the illustrated police news

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.000
 of 1869 entitled "A Wife Driven Insane

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
 by a Husband Tickling Her Feet."

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
 And this guy had fooled his wife into thinking

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000
 that being tied to a plank would help her bad back.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
 And then once she was secured,

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000
 she would drive her to insanity with a feather to the feet.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:32.000
 Oh, my God.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
 You can't afford that twice, though.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.000
 No.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
 Can you?

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
 Well, you're insane by the end of the first?

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:40.000
 Yeah, it's true, yeah.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:45.000
 I was looking into rituals because I just love the idea

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000
 that that was a thing that, as I say, Dickens did this,

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
 he would tour like a stand-up comedian.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
 And so he would do that every day.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:53.000
 It's not like this was a random thing.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
 He would get up and have the rum and the champagne

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000
 and the sherry every single day while he was on tour.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
 And I don't know how you can sustain doing that.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.000
 But it turns out that every great writer had some kind of quirk

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000
 of a ritual that they would stick to.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000
 And I was looking into a few of those.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000
 There's some really fun ones.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:12.000
 Tom Wolf.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:13.000
 We all know Tom Wolf.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:14.000
 Bonfire the Vanities.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:18.000
 His thing was he, one day, had the most amazing what he said

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000
 was the most inspired burst of writing that he's had in a very long time.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000
 He was standing by his window.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:24.000
 He had this burst of writing.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000
 And he loved it so much that he just thought I need to recreate

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
 whatever I did to lead me to this moment of great writing.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
 And he couldn't work it out.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:33.000
 So he kept retracing the steps.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:34.000
 And then he worked out what it was.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
 It was that night that he did this great burst of writing.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000
 He was standing by his window looking outside.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:40.000
 And he was fondling his genitals.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
 And he was like, oh my god, that was it.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000
 Fondling my genitals as what has made me come up with these great ideas.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
 So that's now how Tom Wolf writes.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.000
 And we know this as well because it was in a letter to his editor

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:54.000
 where he wrote that his penis remained limp and unaroused.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000
 Like he told his editor, I worked out what makes me a great writer.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:58.000
 And that's what it is.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.000
 But tons of writers have relied on alcohol.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:02.000
 Haven't they?

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
 Throughout the ages.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.000
 So Tennessee Williams, the playwright, Tennessee Williams.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:11.000
 And she from his diary in 1957 reads two scotches at the bar.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000
 Then three drinks later in the morning.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000
 A Dacquery at Dirty Dicks.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000
 Three glasses of red wine at lunch.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:19.000
 Three of wine at dinner.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.000
 Also a green tranquilizer whose name I do not know.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.000
 And a yellow one, I think is called resurbing or something like that.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.000
 And the bad thing about that is when he wrote it, he was in rehab at the time.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
 genuinely.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000
 J.G. Bamad used to have scotch as well.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:38.000
 And that was because he thought that it changed the microclimate of his brain.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.000
 People justified it in whatever way they needed to.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.000
 They've discovered, speaking of alcohol, that alcohol--

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000
 so, A, scientists have recently discovered with paleogenetics,

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
 which is used as a kind of gene sequencing,

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:53.000
 that humans developed the capacity to digest alcohol successfully

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000
 way before we thought they did.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000
 So we thought they, we did in about 7,000 BC.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000
 And it turns out it was about 10 million years ago.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000
 That's when we got this gene.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000
 And that's the reason that we've survived.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000
 So our ability to properly digest alcohol,

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000
 because all the fruit that was falling from the trees at the time

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.000
 that we needed to eat to survive was rotting and fermenting.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.000
 And there was a mutation in our ancestors' genes,

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000
 which meant that we could eat it, not die.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:17.000
 That's like--

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000
 That's like with the endothols in milk.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000
 Apparently, milk is a new thing to us.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
 Apparently, we've only been able to--

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
 That's why I always offer people milk.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:30.000
 Oh, and the endothol in disguise.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
 And when they pass the test, I know.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:37.000
 And milk intolerance increases as you get closer to the equator.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:38.000
 What? Yeah.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.000
 Britain is the most lactose tolerant country in the world.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:42.000
 Most lactose tolerance.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000
 Lactose tolerance is a mutation.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.000
 And it spreads in prevalence as you get towards the pulse of the Earth.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:48.000
 Wow.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000
 Because I think, isn't there something to do about milk going off?

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:55.000
 I mean, in hot temperatures, that sounds stupid, but I think it's true.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000
 But they just don't have fridges.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:58.000
 They're just leaving their milk to go off.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000
 Well, we didn't have fridges until very recently.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:01.000
 Yeah.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:02.000
 I think they've got them at the equator now.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000
 It's not that far away.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:05.000
 I know.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.000
 What I'm saying is that 500 years ago, you wouldn't have--

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000
 It wouldn't be as easy to keep milk cold.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000
 And there's less of a reason to have the mutation

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:13.000
 because milk is drugless.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.000
 And there's less farming pasture.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:17.000
 OK.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:18.000
 Yeah.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000
 We need to wrap up on the fact that anyone else has anything they want to add.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:26.000
 All I have to add is that Ernest Hemingway, he was an alcoholic,

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:27.000
 another white alcoholic.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:31.000
 And his friend George Plimpton said that by the time he was dying,

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.000
 his liver protruded from his belly like a long fat leech,

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:38.000
 which made me think that if you don't have that, you're probably OK.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000
 All right.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000
 Let's move on to fact number two.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000
 Fact number two is from James.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:51.000
 OK. My fact this week is that crap Christmas jumpers date back to the Romans.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000
 What do you mean by that?

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000
 Well, I genuinely don't know, actually.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:56.000
 Didn't realize his little--

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000
 Yeah. So not Christmas because there wasn't a Christmas there,

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:02.000
 but they did have a similar festival called Satinalia.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:07.000
 And part of it was a festival called Sigilaria on the 23rd of December.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:11.000
 And there was a writer called Marshall who wrote about the gifts

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000
 that you would get around that time.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.000
 And he said that you would get fish sauce, jars of honey,

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.000
 bottles of wine, toothpicks, a few other things.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:23.000
 And then one of the things was a shaggy nersling of a weaver on the sane.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:29.000
 A barbarian garment, a thing uncouth, but not to be despised in cold December.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.000
 So basically, he was saying that in that time of year,

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000
 people would get really horrible jumpers,

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000
 but they would be happy of them because the weather was so bad.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000
 It's a bit more poetic, isn't it?

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:39.000
 Yeah.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000
 Oh, another shaggy nersling of a weaver.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:45.000
 Guys, it's going to be shaggy nersling of a weaver day on Friday.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:49.000
 So do wear your shaggy nersling of a weaver to the office and make a donation.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:54.000
 And also, Satinalia, aristocrats would wear brightly coloured fabrics

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000
 and not necessarily matching ones.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000
 They would wear unusual combinations of clothes.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:02.000
 And the outfit was called the synthesis, which means things being put together.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:06.000
 So I think that's the other strand of the Christmas jumper theory.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:07.000
 Yeah, that's right.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:11.000
 This comes actually from a press release from the University of Redding,

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000
 that I read, and they've gone into all this.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:17.000
 They also said that people then drank raisin wine,

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:21.000
 wine flavoured with pitch, honeyd wine, which does sound nice,

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.000
 and also a special wine for loosening the bowels.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:28.000
 That's who is accepting that at dinner.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.000
 Can I get the bow loosening?

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.000
 What were their toilets like back then?

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:36.000
 Would you like red, white or bow loosening?

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:37.000
 Yeah, exactly.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:38.000
 Or brown, effectively.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:39.000
 Yeah.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:40.000
 And toilets were okay.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:41.000
 Were they?

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:46.000
 Yeah, we found, I mean, the four of us have found a perfectly preserved Roman toilet seat on Hadrian's wall.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:47.000
 Oh.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:48.000
 We haven't, but they have.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:49.000
 They were okay.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000
 They were just sitting off walls.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000
 But they had latrines.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000
 Did they go over the edge of the wall?

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000
 Because there are barbarians on one side of the wall.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.000
 So it was like an attack strategy as well as?

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:04.000
 But that's the thing actually about, you know what, like medieval towns.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:05.000
 Yeah.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.000
 The idea is that you would throw boiling oil on the people attacking you.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:12.000
 But of course they would never do that because oil is a really precious thing that you, you know,

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:13.000
 you need to keep.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.000
 And so that what they would throw is urine and feces.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:17.000
 Okay.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:18.000
 Or sometimes boiling water.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:19.000
 But never oil.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:22.000
 That's one of the best ever cartoons from private aid.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:27.000
 There's a net castle being attacked and the defenders are pouring a huge cauldron of oil over the side.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:28.000
 There's a guy in chef's way.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:29.000
 It's next to them saying drizzle it.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:30.000
 For God's sake drizzle it.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:37.000
 Maybe you were poor boiling oil to show how rich you are though.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:42.000
 In the same way that people have, you know, in Elizabethan times they used to blacken their teeth didn't they?

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:46.000
 Because it showed if you had a really rotting teeth that you were eating lots of rich food.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:50.000
 Maybe it was that kind of, yeah, I think that was why people did that.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.000
 It was because of the mark of status.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:57.000
 There's another weird style that happened in America when TV became a massive thing.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.000
 When people started owning their own personal TV and their houses.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000
 I got this from a Bill Bryson book.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:06.000
 There used to be a type of clothing called videos.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:07.000
 This was before videos.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:12.000
 And you would buy your video to wear to someone's house to watch TV.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:17.000
 And everyone would be wearing the same thing because it was such an event to watch TV in a house.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:23.000
 Did it look like a bit like a black rectangular thing with two circular dials?

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:24.000
 Yeah.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.000
 She knows who the patron saint of television is.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:28.000
 Because a patron saint?

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:29.000
 No, who?

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:35.000
 That is Saint Claire of Assisi, who is one of the followers of Saint Francis of Assisi.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:40.000
 And she was sick in bed and there was a mass going on in the other room.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:43.000
 And she could somehow see the mass happening on the wall.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:47.000
 And that miracle that made her the patron saint of television.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:48.000
 Wow.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:49.000
 What did she see?

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.000
 And she saw the mass happening.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.000
 Is that was it?

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:55.000
 Yeah, it's like song surprise.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:56.000
 Change the channel.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:57.000
 Oh, come on.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.000
 Was it a glass wall?

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:04.000
 There was another saint from Assisi called Saint Vitalis of Assisi.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:09.000
 And he is the patron saint of genital diseases.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:10.000
 Okay.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:11.000
 And.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:15.000
 Don't need to tell me, mate.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.000
 There's a patron saint of STDs.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:18.000
 Yes.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.000
 No, all STDs because I know some George is the patron saint of syphilis.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:22.000
 That's true.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:23.000
 I wouldn't have taken away from him.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:27.000
 No, he's like a junior minister in the STD saint department.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.000
 Obviously, as a broader brief as well.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.000
 So George is the patron saint of lepers too.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:32.000
 Yeah.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:33.000
 Anyway, sorry.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:38.000
 So Saint Vitalis was the patron saint of STDs and diseases of the genitals.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:43.000
 In 2011, there was noction house in Ireland that had his head in a jar.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.000
 Supposedly, his head are relic.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:49.000
 And they sold it to an American movie star.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.000
 And we don't know which movie star it was.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:52.000
 Oh, this is a fun guessing game.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000
 And a fun libel opportunity too.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:55.000
 Yes.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.000
 I say Julia Roberts.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:00.000
 Speaking of heads and Christmas traditions.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:01.000
 Yes.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:05.000
 So there's a Welsh Christmas tradition that I'm not going to be able to pronounce.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.000
 I don't think happens as much now.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.000
 And it happens still in Glamorgan, but nowhere else.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:13.000
 We're just called Marie Lewood, which is where a group of drunken revelers

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.000
 would put a horse's skull on a stick.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:18.000
 And then they'd go around people's houses and bang on their doors at Christmas.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000
 And they'd sing them a carol.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:23.000
 And then you had to have a sing-off with the people in the house.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:24.000
 And it was like a competition.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.000
 And then they had to let you in with your horse's skull.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:27.000
 And they had to feed you.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:30.000
 And then you had to sing a goodbye carol.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.000
 And then you would leave with your horse's skull and go to the next house.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:35.000
 It just sounds like a really weird version of carol singing.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:39.000
 Another tradition is this is an old English tradition cake tossing.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:40.000
 Do you know that one?

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:41.000
 No.

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:42.000
 It's not much to it.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:45.000
 You just get a perfectly good cake and throw it against a wall.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:46.000
 Against a wall.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.000
 Not even seeing how far you can throw it.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.000
 No, no. You stand next to a wall, throw it.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.000
 And it's supposed to like give you a year without any hunger.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:53.000
 Really?

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:54.000
 Yes.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:55.000
 There's another...

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:56.000
 Sorry, gone.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:00.000
 Well, just wanted to share this, which is the theory of when the sweater began.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:01.000
 Because it's quite a vague thing.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:03.000
 You know, it did begin with the Romans or did it begin before that.

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:07.000
 One website I found says it began with 19th century British fishermen.

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:10.000
 Because they needed something chunky and heavy to repel water and keep them warm.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:13.000
 And that is from a website called Dancing with Wolves.

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:14.000
 Nice.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:19.000
 They would make Christmas jumpers for penguins, didn't they, for a while.

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:20.000
 Do you remember that?

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:21.000
 Really?

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.000
 Yeah, there was like an oil spill in New Zealand.

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:24.000
 Yeah, do you remember?

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:25.000
 And then they...

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:32.000
 What they wanted was little jumpers to parten the penguins so that they wouldn't prune themselves and get the oil in their mouth if they prune themselves.

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:35.000
 They thought they might get about 100, but they ended up getting 15,000.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:36.000
 Wow.

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.000
 And actually, they're no good at...

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:42.000
 Anyway, like if you put a sweater on a penguin, it's not really the best thing to do.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:45.000
 The best thing to do is just put it in cold water or warm water.

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:51.000
 I guess that's how they've evolved over millions of years to be able to deal with cold weather.

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:52.000
 Yeah, exactly.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:58.000
 So now whenever you send them a jumper for a penguin, they just put it on like a Thai penguin and they sell it in this shop.

00:16:58.000 --> 00:16:59.000
 Great.

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:00.000
 Thanks.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:07.000
 This is semi-unrelated, but they've done an experiment in the last few months where they've put lingerie on rats.

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:11.000
 And it's to see how they always do it to rats.

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:14.000
 And it's to see how Y-Men are attracted to women at home.

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:15.000
 Really?

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:17.000
 But they put like kind of sexy underwear on rats.

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:20.000
 And then they got them to go and have sex with male rats.

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:26.000
 And then if the same woman came back later, then the guy didn't want to have sex with the female without her wearing the sexy lingerie.

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:35.000
 So it's like, as soon as your programme to believe that the sex is going to be good with the lingerie wearing women, then you don't enjoy it as much or you don't want to do it with the non-laundry wearing women.

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:38.000
 Apparently this proves why men are attracted to women during this lingerie.

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:41.000
 That is a terrible slogan for a Christmas jumper.

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:45.000
 I rat experiments to find that stuff out.

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:51.000
 Because we had a fact in the previous podcast, which was what was it? They were in polyester pants.

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:54.000
 Yeah, rats in polyester pants.

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:56.000
 They can't get it up.

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:57.000
 They can't get it up.

00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:58.000
 They can't get it up.

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:00.000
 They can't get it up in the reaction if they were wearing little trams.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:01.000
 So interesting rats sex lives.

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:02.000
 Wow.

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:05.000
 I don't know what's going on there.

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:08.000
 Well, complained to the polyester company.

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:09.000
 Yeah.

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:11.000
 Okay, time for fact number three.

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:12.000
 And that is Anna.

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:18.000
 Yeah, my fact is that male turkeys blush when they see female turkeys.

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:19.000
 I really like that.

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:21.000
 This is quite sweet.

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:24.000
 Especially if they were in lingerie.

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:25.000
 Why?

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:27.000
 Why do they blush?

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:29.000
 So turkeys don't have a weird anatomy anyway.

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:35.000
 But some people think it's because when turkeys gobble, it actually takes up a lot of energy.

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:38.000
 And they gobble as part of their strutting ritual to attract women.

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:39.000
 Because there's a sexy thing to do.

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:43.000
 And when they gobble, it causes the blood to rise up and up into their face.

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:44.000
 And they turn bright red.

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:45.000
 And they really do go bright red.

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:47.000
 But it's only business for their snooze.

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:49.000
 You know, the turkeys snooze, which I find like the weird...

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:50.000
 No, what is it?

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:55.000
 A snooze is that floppy bit of skin that dangles really far off a turkeys face.

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:58.000
 And it's a secondary sexual organ.

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:01.000
 Because when a turkeys aroused, it gets engorged with blood.

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:02.000
 And it gets longer.

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:06.000
 And female turkeys fancy male turkeys with longer snooze.

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:10.000
 And so that snooze goes bright red when it's trying to reduce...

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:15.000
 Wait, so they have a thing on their face that when they're aroused, it extends?

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:18.000
 Yeah, and it's got no purpose.

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:20.000
 Nobody knows why it's there.

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:23.000
 You also have a thing on your face that extends when you get aroused.

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:24.000
 You think, actually.

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:27.000
 But you have a rectile tissue inside your nose.

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:28.000
 Oh, yes.

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:29.000
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:32.000
 And does it increase in size when you are aroused?

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:33.000
 It can do sometimes.

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:37.000
 And there's a thing called honeymoon rhinitis, which you can get...

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:40.000
 Which apparently, when you get aroused, it makes your sneeze.

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:42.000
 And some people start sneezing when they're aroused.

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:45.000
 Well, this puts a new perspective on the story of Pinocchio.

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:46.000
 Well, this is right.

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:48.000
 Your nose does get longer when you lie, doesn't it?

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:49.000
 Because you get tense.

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:51.000
 And so they say your nose does expand a little.

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:55.000
 So what else people get 10 times bigger when you're aroused as well?

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:56.000
 10 times.

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:57.000
 Yeah, because it's only small.

00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:58.000
 Yeah.

00:19:58.000 --> 00:19:59.000
 Oh, hang on.

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:00.000
 My people's not that small.

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:01.000
 Yeah, you're right.

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:02.000
 That doesn't sound right.

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:03.000
 Maybe the bigger one does it under the surface.

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:09.000
 I think thinking of cartoons when their eyes go, "Rrrrrr!"

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:11.000
 They get bigger, but not by 10 times, obviously.

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:12.000
 Right, OK.

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:14.000
 But so I could be able to tell if someone...

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:16.000
 I don't know if it's noticeable or the nose thing.

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:20.000
 But then if you're a turkey, you can't really play it cool with your snoot, can you?

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:21.000
 That's true.

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:22.000
 And if you blush as well.

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:23.000
 Yeah.

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:24.000
 It's very awkward for them.

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:25.000
 And because they've got...

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:30.000
 So the top of their head turns bright blue, also, when they're around, so they're excited.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:32.000
 Their head turns bright blue.

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:33.000
 So they can turn their head blue.

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:36.000
 So it is actually quite obvious to a woman when they face it.

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:37.000
 Hang on, sorry.

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:38.000
 What?

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:42.000
 So they've got, like, you know, compared to what a turkey looks like, and they're kind of greyish grey head.

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:44.000
 Yeah, they're like turkey head, yeah.

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:45.000
 Yeah, and it goes like...

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:46.000
 They go bright.

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:47.000
 They go bright.

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:48.000
 They're head.

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:49.000
 They go bright blue.

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:50.000
 Yeah.

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:51.000
 Like my jumper bright blue.

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:52.000
 It's more paler than that.

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:53.000
 Oh, okay.

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:54.000
 Yeah.

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:55.000
 So turkey's a great, right?

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:56.000
 And turkeys were...

00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:00.000
 Do we think they were nearly the official animal emblem of America or not?

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:01.000
 This is a myth, apparently.

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:03.000
 But I think it's basically true.

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:07.000
 The idea is that Benjamin Franklin, like them so much, and he thought they were noble animals,

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:10.000
 and he wanted them to be the official masterful bird of the USA.

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:11.000
 So when...

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:15.000
 So when it was decided that they were going to make a bald eagle, the emblem of the USA,

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:22.000
 then Franklin was outraged, and he said it couldn't be a bald eagle because they have bad moral character.

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:27.000
 He said, he wrote his daughter saying, you may have seen them perched in some dead tree

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:31.000
 where too lazy to fish for himself, he watched as the labour of the fishing hawk

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:35.000
 when that diligent bird has taken a fish and is bearing it to his nest for his young,

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:37.000
 the bald eagle pursues him and steals it.

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:42.000
 So he wrote that, and he said, a much more respectable bird and a true native of America is the turkey.

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:44.000
 So I don't know why people keep debunking this.

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:46.000
 Franklin wanted the bird to be...

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:47.000
 Franklin wanted it to be, yeah.

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:48.000
 I have a thing about that.

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:49.000
 And electrocuting them, right?

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:50.000
 Yeah, he wanted to...

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:55.000
 He not only wanted to, he did electrocute turkeys, and on one occasion he got a crowd together

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:59.000
 to watch him doing it and then ended up electrocuting himself, which is amazing.

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:03.000
 He wrote to a friend, a turkey is to be killed for our dinners by the electrical shock

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:07.000
 and roasted by the electrical jack, and he practiced it lots, and then got a crowd together,

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:11.000
 and he was numb for the rest of the evening after he gave himself a huge shock,

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:16.000
 and he wrote to his brother, saying, "Two nights ago, being about to kill a turkey by the shock from two large glass jars,

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:19.000
 I inadvertently took the hole through my own arms and body.

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:23.000
 Do not make this more public, for I am ashamed to have been guilty of so notorious of Blunder.

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:27.000
 So sorry, Franklin, your secrets out now."

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:32.000
 The other thing, though, is that turkeys aren't that noble, are they?

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:33.000
 Really.

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:39.000
 I mean, if you put a male turkey, apparently, in a room with a model of female turkey,

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:44.000
 he'll mate with it just as eagerly as he would with the real thing.

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:48.000
 But he will also do it if you put a turkey head on a stick.

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:50.000
 He'll also try and mate with that.

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:51.000
 Really?

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:52.000
 Yeah.

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:56.000
 And they did an experiment with all the different bits of a turkey that which will work and which won't work.

00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:00.000
 A freshly severed head on a stick was the most effective.

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:01.000
 That's what it liked the most.

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:03.000
 What was the most effective?

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:05.000
 Well, I like you, but I don't know.

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:08.000
 Could you maybe lose everything below your neck?

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:13.000
 Well, yeah, you've got that one's the most effective, followed by a dried male head on a stick,

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:17.000
 followed by a two-year-old withered female head on a stick.

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:19.000
 It's turkey porn just heads.

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:21.000
 It's like breasts.

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:23.000
 Just cut out the body.

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:31.000
 And then last place, but still enlisting a sexual response was a plain balsa wood model of a head.

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:32.000
 They're Andy.

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:36.000
 This nude just got very slightly bigger.

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:37.000
 Wow.

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:40.000
 That's what you're emblem of the USA.

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:42.000
 Tuckies never ask you, you're a leg or a breast man.

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:43.000
 They just say you're a head or a head man.

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:44.000
 I'm a head man.

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:45.000
 Yeah, I love it.

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:49.000
 When was this done, do you know?

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:54.000
 It was done in the late '50s by some people at the University of Pennsylvania.

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:55.000
 Oh, my God.

00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:57.000
 The perverts in the University of Pennsylvania.

00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:01.000
 You know when they say they're cutting science budgets around the world?

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:04.000
 You're just going, but we need to put these rats in braziers.

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:08.000
 And we've been trying to find out if he wants to shag that head.

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:10.000
 I kind of get it now.

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:13.000
 I've had this had decomposing for two years in my office.

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:17.000
 We all think it's going to the mood in bars, and it's there.

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:20.000
 That's where the real budget's going.

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:21.000
 Wow.

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:23.000
 Tuckies aren't very breasty now, aren't they?

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:25.000
 Much more than they're supposed to be.

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:26.000
 Well, I mean these.

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:28.000
 Have noticed, yeah, we were chatting about this the other day.

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:30.000
 Yeah, no, I saw your computer screens.

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:34.000
 They've increased.

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:37.000
 It was the weight trope's website.

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:41.000
 Look at the head on that one.

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:44.000
 Go on.

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:46.000
 Tuckies have got much bigger.

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:49.000
 They've increased by 57% in size since 1980.

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:50.000
 I think.

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:53.000
 Because, I know since 1965, sorry.

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:56.000
 Because we're obviously breeding them to have huge breasts,

00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:58.000
 because we like the taste of turkey breasts.

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:01.000
 So while turkeys are laughing in the face of domestic turkeys,

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:04.000
 because they can fly, they can fly 55 miles an hour, I think.

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:05.000
 Wow.

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:07.000
 And most domesticated turkeys can't fly at all,

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:09.000
 because they're so top-heavy.

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:12.000
 They can run 25 miles an hour.

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:13.000
 Yeah, unbelievable.

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:14.000
 Wild turkeys.

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:15.000
 Yeah, wild turkeys.

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:19.000
 Turkeys can't, farm turkeys can't have sex with each other anymore.

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:20.000
 It's quite sad.

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:24.000
 They're too heavy, and they're sort of a bit distorted.

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:27.000
 And they have to be masturbated.

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:29.000
 And then artificially inseminated.

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:30.000
 And the people who...

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:32.000
 Is it not because they're all dubious now going?

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:34.000
 It's probably just a head on a stick, mate.

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:36.000
 I wouldn't want that.

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:38.000
 But the people who do it call it milking.

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:40.000
 And it's not milking.

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:41.000
 It's not milking.

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:42.000
 Don't dress it up.

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:44.000
 They then...

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:45.000
 All right.

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:46.000
 They sort of...

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:48.000
 Can I read you a brief account of it?

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:52.000
 It won't take long, but the effects will last forever in your mind.

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:55.000
 So this is according to a journalist who went around and visited a turkey farmer.

00:25:55.000 --> 00:26:01.000
 He said, "I was complaining about the impossibility of a journalist getting to see the process when I heard a rustle of feathers beside me.

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:04.000
 The turkey was already upside down in Paul's hands.

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:07.000
 He swiftly uncovered a hole amidst the feathers, gave it a couple of tweaks.

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:11.000
 And there was the turkey semen, looking at like a bit of crumbly old toothpaste.

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:15.000
 "We take this," said Paul, "and suck it into a rubber tube.

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:17.000
 It's then blown into the vagina.

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:22.000
 So you have to suck it up with a rubber tube, and then blow it up another turkey."

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:23.000
 That's a job.

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:25.000
 I hope they didn't...

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:27.000
 That's a job that people actually don't have.

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:29.000
 So what makes you think you're called by?

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:33.000
 Well, I've always been interested in sucking animal semen up through tubes.

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:38.000
 They didn't say the crumbly old toothpaste thing to its face, did they?

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:42.000
 Because that may tend to be quite offensive, in my experience.

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:47.000
 So...

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:48.000
 Do you have any aquafresh?

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:53.000
 Hey, I read that turkey poo.

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:58.000
 Let's say you had two turkeys, and you were like, "Oh, tell me the gender of these two turkeys."

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:01.000
 You can tell which one is a male, and which one is female by their poo.

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:06.000
 Because the poo of a male turkey comes out spiral, like a Mr. Whippy ice cream.

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:08.000
 It comes out just like a...

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:10.000
 But it does. That's the kind of way that it comes out.

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:13.000
 And then a female poo comes out in the shape of a "J."

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:18.000
 Yeah, so that's how you know, because they have different...

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:20.000
 Is this right, James? They've got different eggs.

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:23.000
 Oh, clockers, yeah. They have different shape clockers.

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:26.000
 Another good turkey thing, which I actually discovered last year,

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:30.000
 and is in our fact book, one for one, one for facts to knock you sideways.

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:32.000
 If you want to buy it, is that...

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:35.000
 So in turkey, the word for turkey means Indian bird.

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:38.000
 In Indian, the word for turkey means Peruvian bird.

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:41.000
 In Greece, the word for turkey means French bird.

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:44.000
 And in Malaysia, the word for turkey means Dutch chicken.

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:47.000
 So no one had a clue where it was coming from.

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:49.000
 But it was definitely foreign.

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:52.000
 It was a foreign bird.

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:55.000
 Well, there's a theory that they were called turkeys here,

00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:59.000
 because the merchants who sold them across Europe were Turkish.

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:01.000
 But of course, they're all native to Mexico.

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:04.000
 I was going to say the Native Americans, apparently,

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:07.000
 the real origin of the name is "Furkey."

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:09.000
 So they should be "Furkeys," not turkeys.

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:11.000
 Oh, okay. I didn't know that. Let's go.

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:13.000
 Let's start calling them that.

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:15.000
 Hashtag facts.

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:19.000
 We should move on. Time to move on to our final fact of the evening,

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:21.000
 and that is Andy.

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:24.000
 My fact is that the composer of the song "Jingle Bells"

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:27.000
 also wrote the "Yuletide" classic "We Conquer or Die."

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:32.000
 That was a genuine song written by the same man.

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:36.000
 His name was James Lord Pierpont, and he was an American composer.

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:40.000
 He was also the uncle of JP Morgan, incidentally, the banker.

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:47.000
 And he wrote this song on a number of others, the lyrics to "We Conquer or Die."

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:50.000
 The war drum is beating. Prepare for the fight.

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:52.000
 The stern bigot Northman exalts in his might.

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:55.000
 Go on your bright weapons, your foemen are nigh,

00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:58.000
 and this be our watchword, "We Conquer or Die."

00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:01.000
 So there you go.

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:04.000
 You can see where it led on.

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:07.000
 Was that his difficult second song?

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:09.000
 Which one came first, do we know?

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:11.000
 I think "Jingle Bells" came first.

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:13.000
 Some of them we don't know the dates for.

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:15.000
 I know, he's like someone who wanted to be taken more seriously.

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:17.000
 On those cases.

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:19.000
 Did he write anything else? Is that it, premier?

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:21.000
 Yeah, he wrote a lot of songs.

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:24.000
 Are they all in the Christmas theme or the Aggressive Military theme?

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:26.000
 A lot of them are in the Aggressive Military theme.

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:28.000
 We wrote our battle flag and strike for the south.

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:32.000
 And oh, let me not neglect it, die.

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:36.000
 Because he was on the side of the south in the Civil War.

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:39.000
 And he lived in Boston, Massachusetts originally,

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:42.000
 and then he moved down to Savannah, Georgia,

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:44.000
 which is where he spent the Civil War.

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:47.000
 And he wrote a load of these songs on behalf of the south.

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:49.000
 There's a kind of agit prop thing.

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:51.000
 "Jingle Bells" was the first song to be played from space.

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:52.000
 Wasn't it?

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:53.000
 Wasn't it?

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:54.000
 Yeah, yeah, it was.

00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:55.000
 Really?

00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:59.000
 It was when Tom Stafford and Wally Scherer were in space.

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:01.000
 It was in 1965.

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:02.000
 I think.

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:03.000
 And it was a prank.

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:07.000
 So they said they'd seen a kind of floating asteroid

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:09.000
 or something they were talking to, you know,

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:11.000
 mission control, whatever on the ground, floating,

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:13.000
 and they were going to get it and see what it was,

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:15.000
 and it turned out to be this tiny harmonica.

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:17.000
 It was three eighths of an inch wide,

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:20.000
 and then they launched into a rendition of "Jingle Bells"

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:22.000
 around Christmas time from space.

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:26.000
 They had originally planned to play "We Conqueror Die."

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:28.000
 They couldn't get the rights.

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:32.000
 So they pretended that they saw Santa Claus, is that right?

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:33.000
 Did you say that?

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:34.000
 No.

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:35.000
 So that's what happened.

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:37.000
 They kind of went down to mission control and said,

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:41.000
 "We can see this one guy with 12 other figures flying

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:42.000
 into the Earth's atmosphere."

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:44.000
 And they pretended that they could see Father Christmas.

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:45.000
 Was that what it was supposed to be?

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:47.000
 I just saw them saying they thought it was a satellite.

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:51.000
 No, he said, "I see a command module with eight smaller modules

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:52.000
 in front.

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:55.000
 The pilots of the command module is wearing a red suit."

00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:58.000
 There's a lot of sort of Christmassy elements

00:30:58.000 --> 00:30:59.000
 to space travel.

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:02.000
 They're lying and lying from up there.

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:05.000
 That makes me wonder about the whole moon landing's conspiracy theory

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:08.000
 if they're claiming Santa Claus was there.

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:11.000
 So some other carols.

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:12.000
 They saw three ships.

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:13.000
 You know that song?

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:14.000
 Oh, yes.

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:15.000
 They saw three ships.

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:16.000
 There's an extra verse about that.

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:17.000
 We don't really sing anymore.

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:20.000
 We talk about carrying the dead bodies of the three wise men

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:21.000
 on the ships.

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:22.000
 How did they die?

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:25.000
 I don't say natural causes.

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:30.000
 Yes, so the idea was that these three wise men were on the boats

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:32.000
 and they'd sailed all the way from Bethlehem.

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:35.000
 Now, the problem is that Bethlehem isn't on the coast.

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:38.000
 But people in Britain didn't really know where Bethlehem was

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:39.000
 or in Europe.

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:40.000
 They didn't know.

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:42.000
 They just assumed it was like a seaside resort.

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:44.000
 And so the part of the song goes,

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:47.000
 it sailed from Bethlehem to Cologne, I think it was.

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:48.000
 But how could it do that?

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:50.000
 The each on one ship.

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:51.000
 Yeah, one in each ship.

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:52.000
 Let it snow.

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:53.000
 Let it snow.

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:54.000
 Let it snow.

00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:57.000
 It was written by Sami Khan and Jules Stein.

00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:00.000
 They claimed they came up with the idea to call themselves

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:03.000
 during a heat wave by writing the song.

00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:05.000
 I don't really see how that works though.

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:08.000
 I'm dreaming of a white Christmas was written,

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:09.000
 I think, next to a swimming pool.

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:10.000
 Oh, really?

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:11.000
 I think so, yeah.

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:14.000
 The people find it was Irving Bellin wrote "White Christmas", didn't he?

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:15.000
 Yeah.

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:18.000
 And he was Jewish and he wrote it as a sort of an ironic song.

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:22.000
 And they recently did a poll in America

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:24.000
 of people's top 25 favorite Christmas songs,

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:26.000
 and more than half of them are written by Jewish people.

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:29.000
 And these are the guys who are writing all the great Christmas songs.

00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:31.000
 You know the last year,

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:32.000
 it was either last year that you were before.

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:35.000
 Cost of coffee did a poll amongst their customers

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:39.000
 of what they think is the worst Christmas song that's ever been written.

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:41.000
 You know what came out on top?

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:42.000
 Oh, I don't know.

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:44.000
 It was not Cliff Richards.

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:45.000
 It's a total lie.

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:46.000
 It's a total lie.

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:48.000
 And they've now banned it.

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:55.000
 Yeah, worldwide, they've not allowed any of their coffee shops to play Cliff Richards' song anymore.

00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:57.000
 Well, Irving Bellin tried to get radio stations

00:32:57.000 --> 00:32:59.000
 to ban Elvis Presley's version of "White Christmas".

00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:00.000
 Did he?

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:01.000
 Because I thought it was...

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:03.000
 I think his exact words were,

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:06.000
 it's a profane parody of his cherished Jules Tide standard.

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:10.000
 He ordered staff in New York to...

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:12.000
 Oh, he ordered his own staff to phone radio stations,

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:13.000
 they don't play this,

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:15.000
 because he thought it was so outrageously gross.

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:17.000
 Why was it gross?

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:18.000
 Was it too much?

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:20.000
 I think it was too sexy.

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:21.000
 I don't know.

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:23.000
 Elvis Presley, a lot of radio stations,

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:26.000
 refused to play Elvis Presley's songs when he first became popular

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:28.000
 because they assumed that he was black,

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:30.000
 and it was the time when...

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:31.000
 God.

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:32.000
 Yeah.

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:33.000
 Well, they also banned him.

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:34.000
 I don't know if this is a myth,

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:35.000
 but it might be a myth.

00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:36.000
 Is it a myth?

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:37.000
 No, I think it's not a myth.

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:41.000
 They could only film him sort of torso above.

00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:42.000
 They couldn't show his legs,

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:44.000
 because his legs were too sexy and the dance moves.

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:45.000
 Yeah.

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:46.000
 He was just shaking too much.

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:47.000
 Well, it was mostly his hips.

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:48.000
 Yeah, mostly his hips.

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:49.000
 Yeah, legs are not the problem.

00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:50.000
 Yeah, yeah.

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:51.000
 He's got to cut out that, like...

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:52.000
 Where's one line?

00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:53.000
 Yeah.

00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:54.000
 You can do below the knees, guys,

00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:55.000
 or you can do above the waist.

00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:56.000
 Yeah.

00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:57.000
 Whereas on Turkey, top of the pop,

00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:58.000
 they cut off the head.

00:33:58.000 --> 00:33:59.000
 (LAUGHTER)

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:00.000
 To see the body.

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:01.000
 That's all you get.

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:05.000
 Rudolf Redner's Renda was nearly called "regional."

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:07.000
 (LAUGHTER)

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:08.000
 Regional?

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:09.000
 Yeah, it doesn't scan as well.

00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:10.000
 But it wasn't a song originally.

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:12.000
 It was a coloring book for children,

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:14.000
 and an advertising guy came up with it,

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:16.000
 and he very nearly called it "regional,"

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:17.000
 but then he crucially didn't.

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:20.000
 And it sold two and a half million copies in its first year.

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:21.000
 There's a little coloring book.

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:22.000
 It's huge.

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:24.000
 Which is quite nice about Rudolf Redner's Renda.

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:26.000
 It was written by just a copywriter

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:28.000
 who worked for Montgomery Award,

00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:29.000
 huge department store,

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:31.000
 and they'd just been told they didn't want to spend

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:33.000
 those money buying in Christmas gifts to sell,

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:35.000
 so they told their staff to write a Christmas song.

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:39.000
 So this guy, Robert May, wrote Rudolf Redner's Renda.

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:43.000
 And it sold incredibly well-matched loads of money.

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:45.000
 I think it was remitted into a song.

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:48.000
 And the Montgomery Award, people in charge of Montgomery Award,

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:49.000
 gave him all the rights to it.

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:50.000
 He had no rights to it at all.

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:51.000
 Wow.

00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:52.000
 And he was in trouble.

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:53.000
 His wife had a terminal illness.

00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:55.000
 He was in massive debt.

00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:57.000
 And as soon as it was released as a song,

00:34:57.000 --> 00:34:59.000
 they sold him all the rights to it, 100%.

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:02.000
 And he loved off the proceeds of that until, I think, 1970s when he died.

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:03.000
 Wow.

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:04.000
 So that's quite nice.

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:05.000
 That is nice. That's great.

00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:06.000
 Yeah.

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:08.000
 "Hark the Herald Angels" sing,

00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:09.000
 "The Tune" is written by Mendelssohn,

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:10.000
 which possibly you know,

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:16.000
 and Mendelssohn originally wrote the tune as a tribute to Gutenberg's printing press.

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:17.000
 Yeah.

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:20.000
 It was, how awesome is the printing press song?

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:22.000
 How awesome is the printing press?

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:24.000
 It sounds the same as "Hark the Herald Angels" sing.

00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:25.000
 Yeah, that's the original one.

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:27.000
 It actually went "Gutenberg, the Deutsche Mann"

00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:29.000
 "Zundetter, die Fickle Am"

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:30.000
 or "Die Fackle Am".

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:32.000
 I have no idea.

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:35.000
 So the weirdest thing for me about this fact

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:38.000
 is when you hear someone who's famous for something

00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:40.000
 and then they've produced another bit of work

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:44.000
 that is just so, you know, jingle bells, we conquer or die.

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:46.000
 It's just so different.

00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:50.000
 It's like when I found out that Barbara Cartland invented a glider

00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:52.000
 that the military started using.

00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:53.000
 Sorry, what?

00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:57.000
 Barbara Cartland, the romance novelist who wrote a billion romance novels,

00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:00.000
 also invented a glider that you could fly in,

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:03.000
 that the military was like, that is so good we're using it.

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:05.000
 And that's one of her...

00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:08.000
 Yeah, that's a thing that...

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:14.000
 And Michael Jackson invented the facts machine.

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:16.000
 No, Michael Jackson.

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:18.000
 Actually, I don't know if most people know this,

00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:21.000
 but he wrote the song "Do the Bart Man", the Michael Jackson's.

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:23.000
 Everyone does know that.

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:25.000
 But he wrote the Simpson song "Do the Bart Man".

00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:26.000
 Really?

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:29.000
 And he invented those shoes that let you kind of stand on a slant as well.

00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:30.000
 Yeah, he did actually.

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:31.000
 He was a part of the...

00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:33.000
 When he slants forward, there's a patent taken out

00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:36.000
 where it's weighted boots, and he was one of the invented shoes.

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:40.000
 There's not a nut like this is a kind of shoe that's really caught on since then.

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:41.000
 What was you talking about?

00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:42.000
 We're all wearing them.

00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:43.000
 We're all wearing them now.

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:44.000
 So I've walked over like that.

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:46.000
 This is connected because I wanted to mention this earlier.

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:51.000
 The person who made Christmas carols cool again was St. Francis of Assisi.

00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:52.000
 Also, I believe.

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:56.000
 Yes, so it was at a time when it was in the 13th century,

00:36:56.000 --> 00:37:01.000
 at a time when it was all like very serious and very somber.

00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:04.000
 And he tried to make Christmas celebrations fun again.

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:10.000
 And he made it so that, for instance, drinking songs that were sung in taverns,

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:11.000
 like fun drinking songs.

00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:15.000
 He made them be rewritten with Christmas lyrics.

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:16.000
 And actually...

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:21.000
 A few years ago, the Pope said that he was a playboy, Francis of Assisi.

00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:22.000
 What do you mean?

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:23.000
 Well, he started off his life.

00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:24.000
 He was a drinker and he was a partier.

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:26.000
 And then he gave away all this stuff to a leper.

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:29.000
 And the Pope actually said that he was one of the original playboys.

00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:31.000
 Fun guy.

00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:32.000
 Created an activity, I think.

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:34.000
 He turned an activity into a fun theatrical event.

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:38.000
 So decided that the birth of Jesus should be something that we all go and enjoy watching.

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:41.000
 The Vatican didn't have a Christmas tree until 1982.

00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:42.000
 Did it not?

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:43.000
 No.

00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:45.000
 I think they associated it with being the old heathen thing.

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:46.000
 Wow.

00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:47.000
 Yeah.

00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:49.000
 There's a thing in America where you call them holiday trees.

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:54.000
 I just read this really random report where there was a guy who...

00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:55.000
 he was a politician who died.

00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:56.000
 He had a previous career.

00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:58.000
 I can't quite remember what his previous career was.

00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:01.000
 And when he died, apparently it was just such a big thing in his life.

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:04.000
 He hated the idea that things were called holiday trees.

00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:05.000
 And he wanted to be called Christmas trees.

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:09.000
 That when Arnold Schwarzenegger spoke at his funeral, he said,

00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:13.000
 "I swear I will make the Christmas tree return."

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:15.000
 It was the report that came out.

00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:21.000
 Arnold Schwarzenegger promises Christmas trees to return in funeral eulogy.

00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:23.000
 We need to wrap up.

00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:24.000
 Do you guys have any...

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:25.000
 Yeah, yeah.

00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:28.000
 Well, was originally a bit of a saucy song.

00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:30.000
 I just wanted to tell you that.

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:32.000
 The second verse, it goes,

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:34.000
 "A day or two ago, I thought I'd take a ride.

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:37.000
 And soon Miss Fanny Bright was seated by my side.

00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:39.000
 The horse was lean and lank.

00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:40.000
 Miss Fortune seemed as lot.

00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:43.000
 He got into a drifted bank and then we got up-sought.

00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:46.000
 Which no one knows what it means.

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:49.000
 But...

00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:52.000
 It sounds like it should be upset, but it didn't quite run.

00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:54.000
 I think that's exactly what it means, actually.

00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:55.000
 Yeah.

00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:57.000
 And then now the ground is white.

00:38:57.000 --> 00:38:58.000
 Go it while you're young.

00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:00.000
 Take the girls tonight and sing this song.

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:03.000
 Basically, a sleigh was like having a sweet ride in the fifties.

00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:05.000
 And you'd go and sleigh everywhere.

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:07.000
 And you'd go up into the hills up to...

00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:10.000
 Going to sleigh everywhere sounds a bit like some kind of gory.

00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:11.000
 Yeah.

00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:13.000
 You don't want to be involved with...

00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:14.000
 But you go sleigh riding.

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:16.000
 You know, that was very impressive to a young lady.

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:17.000
 You've got a sleigh.

00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:18.000
 Four.

00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:19.000
 I have a...

00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:20.000
 Or just one more thing to add.

00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:25.000
 Which is more of a feminist mission statement about the Holly and the Ivy.

00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:27.000
 And the Holly and the Ivy, the song.

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:29.000
 So it's always kind of bugged me how...

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:33.000
 You know how that ends, saying of all the trees that are in there with the Holly bears, the crown.

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:35.000
 So in the Holly and the Ivy, the Holly's won.

00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:38.000
 And the Holly's a bit of a dick because it's all spiky and nasty.

00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:44.000
 And actually, this dates back to medieval times when the Holly represented the masculinity of the male form.

00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:45.000
 And the Ivy was a woman.

00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:47.000
 The Ivy was this weak gentle woman.

00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:50.000
 The Holly was this strong and it's very resilient and it represented a man.

00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:55.000
 And in medieval villages, they were seeing the women would sing, have competitions against the men.

00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:57.000
 And they would be the Ivy and the men would be the Holly.

00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:00.000
 So every time women, you sing the Holly and the Ivy.

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:02.000
 And you finish saying the Holly bears the crown.

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:04.000
 You're saying the men of one.

00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:06.000
 That's what that means.

00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:07.000
 So we need to change it, don't we?

00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:08.000
 We need to change it.

00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:10.000
 Get Arnold Schwarzenegger on the phone.

00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:12.000
 [laughter]

00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:14.000
 I swear to you, Anna.

00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:17.000
 The Ivy will rise again.

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:22.000
 [applause]

00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:23.000
 Okay, that's it.

00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:25.000
