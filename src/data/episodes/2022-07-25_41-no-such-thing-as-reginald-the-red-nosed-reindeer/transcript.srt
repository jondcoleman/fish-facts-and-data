1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
 We run it on QI a few years ago.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:02,000
 Yeah.

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
 Which was, there's no such thing as a fish.

4
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
 And it's not such thing as a fish.

5
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
 No, seriously, it's in the Oxford Dictionary of Underwater Life.

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
 It says it, right there, first paragraph, no such thing as a fish.

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:20,000
 Hello, and welcome to another episode.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
 And no such thing as a fish, a weekly podcast.

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
 Coming to you this week from the Aces and Aids Bar in Top No Park.

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
 I am sitting here with Anichesinski, James Harkin.

12
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
 And Annie Murray, this is our Christmas special.

13
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
 And once again, we gathered around the microphones

14
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
 with our four favorite facts in the last seven days.

15
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
 And in no particular order, here we go.

16
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
 We begin with my fact.

17
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
 My fact this week is that before going on stage to read a Christmas carol,

18
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
 Charles Dickens had a warm up routine of drinking a pint of champagne.

19
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
 In the morning when he woke up, he had two tablespoons of rum.

20
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
 He would have the pint of champagne at lunch.

21
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
 And then just before he went on stage, he would have cherry,

22
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
 which he would mix raw egg into.

23
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
 Wow.

24
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
 The interesting thing is that you would think,

25
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
 okay, Charles Dickens, he probably did one or two readings of a Christmas carol.

26
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,000
 If you look into his biography, you could almost claim that he was as much a performer as a rider.

27
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
 He spent years as a performer.

28
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
 He would go on massive tours.

29
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
 He was like Michael McIntyre.

30
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
 He was like, properly always on tour.

31
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
 One of his stars in America got him $2.3 million.

32
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
 That's how much.

33
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
 In today's money.

34
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
 Oh, in today's money.

35
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
 Oh.

36
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
 But so.

37
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
 Another thing he used to do at his tours is hypnotize his wife.

38
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
 And also as a warm up act, I think.

39
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
 Okay, so that was his warm up routine, the warm up act.

40
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
 hypnotize his wife.

41
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
 He was really in tipnosis.

42
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
 And so he'd bring his wife on stage and show off.

43
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
 Wow.

44
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
 Yeah.

45
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
 What would he make his wife do?

46
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
 I think he just made, like, be able to obey him in every way,

47
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
 which maybe she was doing already.

48
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
 But it was the 19th century.

49
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
 So he was really into mesmerism, which I mentioned,

50
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
 because you, like people whose names,

51
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
 are directly related to the thing that they created.

52
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
 Anton Mesmer came up with mesmerism, which is hypnotism.

53
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
 You know, Mesmer had a big tree in his garden

54
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
 that people would come and hug.

55
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
 And that's where tree hugging came from.

56
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
 He claimed that he had mesmerised it and made it,

57
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
 given it some of his hypnotic.

58
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
 He called it animal magnetism, didn't he?

59
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
 Yes, he did.

60
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
 Yeah.

61
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
 And he also claimed he had mesmerised the sun.

62
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
 Again, remotely.

63
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
 And he just said, yeah, if you get any sunlight,

64
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
 you're getting some of my mesmeric power now.

65
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
 I mean, he was a charlatan.

66
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
 Wow.

67
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
 Charles Dickens, and a Christmas Carol.

68
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
 So he made no money from it.

69
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
 In spite of the fact that it was incredibly popular.

70
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
 So within maybe six weeks, there were five different performances

71
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
 of it on the stage in London, all over London at different theatres.

72
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
 But they had not very good copyright laws.

73
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
 And basically pirates stole pirates.

74
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
 Pirates.

75
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
 Pirates.

76
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
 19th century is the right time for pirates.

77
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
 No, actual book pirates.

78
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
 What am I saying?

79
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
 Copyright pirate.

80
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
 It was pirated.

81
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
 That's what I'm looking for.

82
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
 And then he sued the pirates.

83
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
 And I'm going to keep using the word pirates.

84
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
 And they declared themselves bankrupt.

85
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
 So he was left to pay the equivalent of 56,000 pounds

86
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
 in modern day money in his own legal fees.

87
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
 Because they just sold it immediately.

88
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
 So it's quite sad for him.

89
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
 He did have speaking of pirates cowboy connections.

90
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
 Pirates and cowboys are kind of connected right in people's minds.

91
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:27,000
 So what kind of cool murderous figures from history.

92
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:32,000
 So butch Cassidy's grandfather was the basis for Oliver Twist.

93
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
 It is thought.

94
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:38,000
 So butch Cassidy's great grandfather went into business with Charles Dickens' father.

95
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
 And it ended up falling apart.

96
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
 They both ended up in prison together.

97
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
 And Charles Dickens grew up saying butch Cassidy's grandfather

98
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
 they're being a beggar on the streets.

99
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
 And Oliver Twist.

100
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
 It's thought he based.

101
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
 He based it on butch Cassidy's grandfather.

102
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
 It's amazing.

103
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
 For a second, I thought he said he was the basis for Oliver Twist.

104
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
 I'm not a band.

105
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
 No, not a band in that.

106
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
 Do you know who Scrooge was based on?

107
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
 One person they thought it might have been based on Scrooge

108
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
 was a guy called Jimmy Wood.

109
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
 And he was a very famous miser back in the day.

110
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
 He was such a miser that his coffin was said to be stoned when he died.

111
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
 They all threw stones at him because they hated him so much.

112
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
 He once went to Gloucester to Tugesbury and jumped on the back of the hearse

113
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
 because he didn't want to pay for a carriage.

114
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
 He chose to die because there was a coffin passing by.

115
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
 And he thought, "Now will be a good time to save money."

116
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
 And he used to...

117
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
 Also, if you're stoning somebody's coffin, that's too late.

118
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
 Stoned the ones that...

119
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
 Stoned the ones that they're living.

120
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
 I don't stoned them at all.

121
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

122
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
 That's not advocate.

123
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
 But he also would walk down the docks

124
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
 and there would be coal ships going past

125
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
 and he would just grab small bits of coal

126
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
 that came off these ships just so they didn't have to pay for them.

127
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
 Pay for the coal himself.

128
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
 So he's a real miser and they reckon that.

129
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
 And he's quite famous for it at the time as well.

130
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
 Right, okay.

131
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
 Did Dickens actually base Scrooge on a person, though?

132
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
 It might be on him.

133
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
 There's a few other people as well.

134
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
 Right, okay.

135
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
 There's a good person called Jasper Packelmerton

136
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
 who's in the Old Curiosity Shop.

137
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:07,000
 And he killed his 14 wives by tickling them to death.

138
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,000
 And apparently he's based on a real person, amazingly.

139
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,000
 Based on an article in the illustrated police news

140
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,000
 of 1869 entitled "A Wife Driven Insane

141
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
 by a Husband Tickling Her Feet."

142
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
 And this guy had fooled his wife into thinking

143
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
 that being tied to a plank would help her bad back.

144
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
 And then once she was secured,

145
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
 she would drive her to insanity with a feather to the feet.

146
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
 Oh, my God.

147
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
 You can't afford that twice, though.

148
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
 No.

149
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
 Can you?

150
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
 Well, you're insane by the end of the first?

151
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
 Yeah, it's true, yeah.

152
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,000
 I was looking into rituals because I just love the idea

153
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
 that that was a thing that, as I say, Dickens did this,

154
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
 he would tour like a stand-up comedian.

155
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
 And so he would do that every day.

156
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
 It's not like this was a random thing.

157
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
 He would get up and have the rum and the champagne

158
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
 and the sherry every single day while he was on tour.

159
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
 And I don't know how you can sustain doing that.

160
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,000
 But it turns out that every great writer had some kind of quirk

161
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
 of a ritual that they would stick to.

162
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
 And I was looking into a few of those.

163
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
 There's some really fun ones.

164
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
 Tom Wolf.

165
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
 We all know Tom Wolf.

166
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
 Bonfire the Vanities.

167
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,000
 His thing was he, one day, had the most amazing what he said

168
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
 was the most inspired burst of writing that he's had in a very long time.

169
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
 He was standing by his window.

170
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
 He had this burst of writing.

171
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
 And he loved it so much that he just thought I need to recreate

172
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
 whatever I did to lead me to this moment of great writing.

173
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
 And he couldn't work it out.

174
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
 So he kept retracing the steps.

175
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
 And then he worked out what it was.

176
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
 It was that night that he did this great burst of writing.

177
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
 He was standing by his window looking outside.

178
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
 And he was fondling his genitals.

179
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
 And he was like, oh my god, that was it.

180
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
 Fondling my genitals as what has made me come up with these great ideas.

181
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
 So that's now how Tom Wolf writes.

182
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
 And we know this as well because it was in a letter to his editor

183
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,000
 where he wrote that his penis remained limp and unaroused.

184
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
 Like he told his editor, I worked out what makes me a great writer.

185
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
 And that's what it is.

186
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
 But tons of writers have relied on alcohol.

187
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
 Haven't they?

188
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
 Throughout the ages.

189
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
 So Tennessee Williams, the playwright, Tennessee Williams.

190
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,000
 And she from his diary in 1957 reads two scotches at the bar.

191
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
 Then three drinks later in the morning.

192
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
 A Dacquery at Dirty Dicks.

193
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
 Three glasses of red wine at lunch.

194
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
 Three of wine at dinner.

195
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
 Also a green tranquilizer whose name I do not know.

196
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
 And a yellow one, I think is called resurbing or something like that.

197
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
 And the bad thing about that is when he wrote it, he was in rehab at the time.

198
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
 [LAUGHTER]

199
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
 genuinely.

200
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
 J.G. Bamad used to have scotch as well.

201
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,000
 And that was because he thought that it changed the microclimate of his brain.

202
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
 People justified it in whatever way they needed to.

203
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
 They've discovered, speaking of alcohol, that alcohol--

204
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
 so, A, scientists have recently discovered with paleogenetics,

205
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
 which is used as a kind of gene sequencing,

206
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,000
 that humans developed the capacity to digest alcohol successfully

207
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
 way before we thought they did.

208
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
 So we thought they, we did in about 7,000 BC.

209
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
 And it turns out it was about 10 million years ago.

210
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
 That's when we got this gene.

211
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
 And that's the reason that we've survived.

212
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
 So our ability to properly digest alcohol,

213
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
 because all the fruit that was falling from the trees at the time

214
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
 that we needed to eat to survive was rotting and fermenting.

215
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
 And there was a mutation in our ancestors' genes,

216
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
 which meant that we could eat it, not die.

217
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
 That's like--

218
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
 That's like with the endothols in milk.

219
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
 Apparently, milk is a new thing to us.

220
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
 Apparently, we've only been able to--

221
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
 That's why I always offer people milk.

222
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,000
 Oh, and the endothol in disguise.

223
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
 And when they pass the test, I know.

224
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:37,000
 And milk intolerance increases as you get closer to the equator.

225
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
 What? Yeah.

226
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
 Britain is the most lactose tolerant country in the world.

227
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
 Most lactose tolerance.

228
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
 Lactose tolerance is a mutation.

229
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
 And it spreads in prevalence as you get towards the pulse of the Earth.

230
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
 Wow.

231
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
 Because I think, isn't there something to do about milk going off?

232
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,000
 I mean, in hot temperatures, that sounds stupid, but I think it's true.

233
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
 But they just don't have fridges.

234
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
 They're just leaving their milk to go off.

235
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
 Well, we didn't have fridges until very recently.

236
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
 Yeah.

237
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
 I think they've got them at the equator now.

238
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
 It's not that far away.

239
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
 I know.

240
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
 What I'm saying is that 500 years ago, you wouldn't have--

241
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
 It wouldn't be as easy to keep milk cold.

242
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
 And there's less of a reason to have the mutation

243
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
 because milk is drugless.

244
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
 And there's less farming pasture.

245
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
 OK.

246
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
 Yeah.

247
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
 We need to wrap up on the fact that anyone else has anything they want to add.

248
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:26,000
 All I have to add is that Ernest Hemingway, he was an alcoholic,

249
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
 another white alcoholic.

250
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,000
 And his friend George Plimpton said that by the time he was dying,

251
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
 his liver protruded from his belly like a long fat leech,

252
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,000
 which made me think that if you don't have that, you're probably OK.

253
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
 All right.

254
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
 Let's move on to fact number two.

255
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
 Fact number two is from James.

256
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:51,000
 OK. My fact this week is that crap Christmas jumpers date back to the Romans.

257
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
 What do you mean by that?

258
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
 Well, I genuinely don't know, actually.

259
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
 Didn't realize his little--

260
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
 Yeah. So not Christmas because there wasn't a Christmas there,

261
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,000
 but they did have a similar festival called Satinalia.

262
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:07,000
 And part of it was a festival called Sigilaria on the 23rd of December.

263
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,000
 And there was a writer called Marshall who wrote about the gifts

264
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
 that you would get around that time.

265
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
 And he said that you would get fish sauce, jars of honey,

266
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
 bottles of wine, toothpicks, a few other things.

267
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,000
 And then one of the things was a shaggy nersling of a weaver on the sane.

268
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:29,000
 A barbarian garment, a thing uncouth, but not to be despised in cold December.

269
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
 So basically, he was saying that in that time of year,

270
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
 people would get really horrible jumpers,

271
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
 but they would be happy of them because the weather was so bad.

272
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
 It's a bit more poetic, isn't it?

273
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
 Yeah.

274
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
 Oh, another shaggy nersling of a weaver.

275
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,000
 Guys, it's going to be shaggy nersling of a weaver day on Friday.

276
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,000
 So do wear your shaggy nersling of a weaver to the office and make a donation.

277
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:54,000
 And also, Satinalia, aristocrats would wear brightly coloured fabrics

278
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
 and not necessarily matching ones.

279
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
 They would wear unusual combinations of clothes.

280
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,000
 And the outfit was called the synthesis, which means things being put together.

281
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,000
 So I think that's the other strand of the Christmas jumper theory.

282
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
 Yeah, that's right.

283
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,000
 This comes actually from a press release from the University of Redding,

284
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
 that I read, and they've gone into all this.

285
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:17,000
 They also said that people then drank raisin wine,

286
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,000
 wine flavoured with pitch, honeyd wine, which does sound nice,

287
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
 and also a special wine for loosening the bowels.

288
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,000
 That's who is accepting that at dinner.

289
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
 Can I get the bow loosening?

290
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
 What were their toilets like back then?

291
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
 Would you like red, white or bow loosening?

292
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
 Yeah, exactly.

293
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
 Or brown, effectively.

294
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
 Yeah.

295
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
 And toilets were okay.

296
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
 Were they?

297
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:46,000
 Yeah, we found, I mean, the four of us have found a perfectly preserved Roman toilet seat on Hadrian's wall.

298
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
 Oh.

299
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
 We haven't, but they have.

300
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
 They were okay.

301
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
 They were just sitting off walls.

302
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
 But they had latrines.

303
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
 Did they go over the edge of the wall?

304
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
 Because there are barbarians on one side of the wall.

305
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
 So it was like an attack strategy as well as?

306
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,000
 But that's the thing actually about, you know what, like medieval towns.

307
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
 Yeah.

308
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
 The idea is that you would throw boiling oil on the people attacking you.

309
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,000
 But of course they would never do that because oil is a really precious thing that you, you know,

310
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
 you need to keep.

311
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
 And so that what they would throw is urine and feces.

312
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
 Okay.

313
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
 Or sometimes boiling water.

314
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
 But never oil.

315
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
 That's one of the best ever cartoons from private aid.

316
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:27,000
 There's a net castle being attacked and the defenders are pouring a huge cauldron of oil over the side.

317
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
 There's a guy in chef's way.

318
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
 It's next to them saying drizzle it.

319
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
 For God's sake drizzle it.

320
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:37,000
 Maybe you were poor boiling oil to show how rich you are though.

321
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:42,000
 In the same way that people have, you know, in Elizabethan times they used to blacken their teeth didn't they?

322
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,000
 Because it showed if you had a really rotting teeth that you were eating lots of rich food.

323
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,000
 Maybe it was that kind of, yeah, I think that was why people did that.

324
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
 It was because of the mark of status.

325
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:57,000
 There's another weird style that happened in America when TV became a massive thing.

326
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
 When people started owning their own personal TV and their houses.

327
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
 I got this from a Bill Bryson book.

328
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,000
 There used to be a type of clothing called videos.

329
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
 This was before videos.

330
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:12,000
 And you would buy your video to wear to someone's house to watch TV.

331
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:17,000
 And everyone would be wearing the same thing because it was such an event to watch TV in a house.

332
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:23,000
 Did it look like a bit like a black rectangular thing with two circular dials?

333
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
 Yeah.

334
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
 She knows who the patron saint of television is.

335
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
 Because a patron saint?

336
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
 No, who?

337
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:35,000
 That is Saint Claire of Assisi, who is one of the followers of Saint Francis of Assisi.

338
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:40,000
 And she was sick in bed and there was a mass going on in the other room.

339
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
 And she could somehow see the mass happening on the wall.

340
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:47,000
 And that miracle that made her the patron saint of television.

341
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
 Wow.

342
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
 What did she see?

343
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
 And she saw the mass happening.

344
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,000
 Is that was it?

345
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
 Yeah, it's like song surprise.

346
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
 Change the channel.

347
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
 Oh, come on.

348
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
 Was it a glass wall?

349
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:04,000
 There was another saint from Assisi called Saint Vitalis of Assisi.

350
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:09,000
 And he is the patron saint of genital diseases.

351
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
 Okay.

352
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
 And.

353
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:15,000
 Don't need to tell me, mate.

354
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
 There's a patron saint of STDs.

355
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
 Yes.

356
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
 No, all STDs because I know some George is the patron saint of syphilis.

357
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
 That's true.

358
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
 I wouldn't have taken away from him.

359
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:27,000
 No, he's like a junior minister in the STD saint department.

360
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
 Obviously, as a broader brief as well.

361
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
 So George is the patron saint of lepers too.

362
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
 Yeah.

363
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
 Anyway, sorry.

364
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:38,000
 So Saint Vitalis was the patron saint of STDs and diseases of the genitals.

365
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:43,000
 In 2011, there was noction house in Ireland that had his head in a jar.

366
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
 Supposedly, his head are relic.

367
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:49,000
 And they sold it to an American movie star.

368
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
 And we don't know which movie star it was.

369
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
 Oh, this is a fun guessing game.

370
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
 And a fun libel opportunity too.

371
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
 Yes.

372
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
 I say Julia Roberts.

373
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
 Speaking of heads and Christmas traditions.

374
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
 Yes.

375
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:05,000
 So there's a Welsh Christmas tradition that I'm not going to be able to pronounce.

376
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
 I don't think happens as much now.

377
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
 And it happens still in Glamorgan, but nowhere else.

378
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:13,000
 We're just called Marie Lewood, which is where a group of drunken revelers

379
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
 would put a horse's skull on a stick.

380
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,000
 And then they'd go around people's houses and bang on their doors at Christmas.

381
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
 And they'd sing them a carol.

382
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
 And then you had to have a sing-off with the people in the house.

383
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
 And it was like a competition.

384
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
 And then they had to let you in with your horse's skull.

385
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
 And they had to feed you.

386
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,000
 And then you had to sing a goodbye carol.

387
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
 And then you would leave with your horse's skull and go to the next house.

388
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,000
 It just sounds like a really weird version of carol singing.

389
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:39,000
 Another tradition is this is an old English tradition cake tossing.

390
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
 Do you know that one?

391
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
 No.

392
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
 It's not much to it.

393
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,000
 You just get a perfectly good cake and throw it against a wall.

394
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
 Against a wall.

395
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
 Not even seeing how far you can throw it.

396
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
 No, no. You stand next to a wall, throw it.

397
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
 And it's supposed to like give you a year without any hunger.

398
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
 Really?

399
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
 Yes.

400
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
 There's another...

401
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
 Sorry, gone.

402
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,000
 Well, just wanted to share this, which is the theory of when the sweater began.

403
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
 Because it's quite a vague thing.

404
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
 You know, it did begin with the Romans or did it begin before that.

405
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:07,000
 One website I found says it began with 19th century British fishermen.

406
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,000
 Because they needed something chunky and heavy to repel water and keep them warm.

407
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,000
 And that is from a website called Dancing with Wolves.

408
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
 Nice.

409
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:19,000
 They would make Christmas jumpers for penguins, didn't they, for a while.

410
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
 Do you remember that?

411
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
 Really?

412
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
 Yeah, there was like an oil spill in New Zealand.

413
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
 Yeah, do you remember?

414
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
 And then they...

415
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:32,000
 What they wanted was little jumpers to parten the penguins so that they wouldn't prune themselves and get the oil in their mouth if they prune themselves.

416
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,000
 They thought they might get about 100, but they ended up getting 15,000.

417
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
 Wow.

418
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
 And actually, they're no good at...

419
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,000
 Anyway, like if you put a sweater on a penguin, it's not really the best thing to do.

420
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
 The best thing to do is just put it in cold water or warm water.

421
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:51,000
 I guess that's how they've evolved over millions of years to be able to deal with cold weather.

422
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
 Yeah, exactly.

423
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:58,000
 So now whenever you send them a jumper for a penguin, they just put it on like a Thai penguin and they sell it in this shop.

424
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
 Great.

425
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
 Thanks.

426
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:07,000
 This is semi-unrelated, but they've done an experiment in the last few months where they've put lingerie on rats.

427
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:11,000
 And it's to see how they always do it to rats.

428
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
 And it's to see how Y-Men are attracted to women at home.

429
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
 Really?

430
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
 But they put like kind of sexy underwear on rats.

431
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
 And then they got them to go and have sex with male rats.

432
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:26,000
 And then if the same woman came back later, then the guy didn't want to have sex with the female without her wearing the sexy lingerie.

433
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:35,000
 So it's like, as soon as your programme to believe that the sex is going to be good with the lingerie wearing women, then you don't enjoy it as much or you don't want to do it with the non-laundry wearing women.

434
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,000
 Apparently this proves why men are attracted to women during this lingerie.

435
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,000
 That is a terrible slogan for a Christmas jumper.

436
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:45,000
 I rat experiments to find that stuff out.

437
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:51,000
 Because we had a fact in the previous podcast, which was what was it? They were in polyester pants.

438
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,000
 Yeah, rats in polyester pants.

439
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
 They can't get it up.

440
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
 They can't get it up.

441
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
 They can't get it up.

442
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
 They can't get it up in the reaction if they were wearing little trams.

443
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
 So interesting rats sex lives.

444
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
 Wow.

445
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,000
 I don't know what's going on there.

446
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,000
 Well, complained to the polyester company.

447
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
 Yeah.

448
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
 Okay, time for fact number three.

449
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
 And that is Anna.

450
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:18,000
 Yeah, my fact is that male turkeys blush when they see female turkeys.

451
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
 I really like that.

452
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
 This is quite sweet.

453
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,000
 Especially if they were in lingerie.

454
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
 Why?

455
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
 Why do they blush?

456
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
 So turkeys don't have a weird anatomy anyway.

457
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:35,000
 But some people think it's because when turkeys gobble, it actually takes up a lot of energy.

458
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,000
 And they gobble as part of their strutting ritual to attract women.

459
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
 Because there's a sexy thing to do.

460
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:43,000
 And when they gobble, it causes the blood to rise up and up into their face.

461
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
 And they turn bright red.

462
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
 And they really do go bright red.

463
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
 But it's only business for their snooze.

464
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
 You know, the turkeys snooze, which I find like the weird...

465
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
 No, what is it?

466
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:55,000
 A snooze is that floppy bit of skin that dangles really far off a turkeys face.

467
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,000
 And it's a secondary sexual organ.

468
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,000
 Because when a turkeys aroused, it gets engorged with blood.

469
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
 And it gets longer.

470
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,000
 And female turkeys fancy male turkeys with longer snooze.

471
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:10,000
 And so that snooze goes bright red when it's trying to reduce...

472
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:15,000
 Wait, so they have a thing on their face that when they're aroused, it extends?

473
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,000
 Yeah, and it's got no purpose.

474
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
 Nobody knows why it's there.

475
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,000
 You also have a thing on your face that extends when you get aroused.

476
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
 You think, actually.

477
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,000
 But you have a rectile tissue inside your nose.

478
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
 Oh, yes.

479
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

480
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,000
 And does it increase in size when you are aroused?

481
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
 It can do sometimes.

482
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:37,000
 And there's a thing called honeymoon rhinitis, which you can get...

483
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
 Which apparently, when you get aroused, it makes your sneeze.

484
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
 And some people start sneezing when they're aroused.

485
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,000
 Well, this puts a new perspective on the story of Pinocchio.

486
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
 Well, this is right.

487
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
 Your nose does get longer when you lie, doesn't it?

488
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
 Because you get tense.

489
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
 And so they say your nose does expand a little.

490
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:55,000
 So what else people get 10 times bigger when you're aroused as well?

491
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
 10 times.

492
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
 Yeah, because it's only small.

493
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
 Yeah.

494
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
 Oh, hang on.

495
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
 My people's not that small.

496
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
 Yeah, you're right.

497
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
 That doesn't sound right.

498
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
 Maybe the bigger one does it under the surface.

499
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:09,000
 I think thinking of cartoons when their eyes go, "Rrrrrr!"

500
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
 They get bigger, but not by 10 times, obviously.

501
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
 Right, OK.

502
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
 But so I could be able to tell if someone...

503
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
 I don't know if it's noticeable or the nose thing.

504
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:20,000
 But then if you're a turkey, you can't really play it cool with your snoot, can you?

505
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
 That's true.

506
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
 And if you blush as well.

507
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
 Yeah.

508
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
 It's very awkward for them.

509
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
 And because they've got...

510
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:30,000
 So the top of their head turns bright blue, also, when they're around, so they're excited.

511
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
 Their head turns bright blue.

512
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
 So they can turn their head blue.

513
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,000
 So it is actually quite obvious to a woman when they face it.

514
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
 Hang on, sorry.

515
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
 What?

516
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,000
 So they've got, like, you know, compared to what a turkey looks like, and they're kind of greyish grey head.

517
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
 Yeah, they're like turkey head, yeah.

518
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
 Yeah, and it goes like...

519
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
 They go bright.

520
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
 They go bright.

521
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
 They're head.

522
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
 They go bright blue.

523
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
 Yeah.

524
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
 Like my jumper bright blue.

525
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
 It's more paler than that.

526
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
 Oh, okay.

527
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
 Yeah.

528
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
 So turkey's a great, right?

529
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
 And turkeys were...

530
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,000
 Do we think they were nearly the official animal emblem of America or not?

531
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
 This is a myth, apparently.

532
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
 But I think it's basically true.

533
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:07,000
 The idea is that Benjamin Franklin, like them so much, and he thought they were noble animals,

534
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,000
 and he wanted them to be the official masterful bird of the USA.

535
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
 So when...

536
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:15,000
 So when it was decided that they were going to make a bald eagle, the emblem of the USA,

537
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:22,000
 then Franklin was outraged, and he said it couldn't be a bald eagle because they have bad moral character.

538
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:27,000
 He said, he wrote his daughter saying, you may have seen them perched in some dead tree

539
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:31,000
 where too lazy to fish for himself, he watched as the labour of the fishing hawk

540
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:35,000
 when that diligent bird has taken a fish and is bearing it to his nest for his young,

541
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
 the bald eagle pursues him and steals it.

542
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:42,000
 So he wrote that, and he said, a much more respectable bird and a true native of America is the turkey.

543
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
 So I don't know why people keep debunking this.

544
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
 Franklin wanted the bird to be...

545
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
 Franklin wanted it to be, yeah.

546
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
 I have a thing about that.

547
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
 And electrocuting them, right?

548
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
 Yeah, he wanted to...

549
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:55,000
 He not only wanted to, he did electrocute turkeys, and on one occasion he got a crowd together

550
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:59,000
 to watch him doing it and then ended up electrocuting himself, which is amazing.

551
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:03,000
 He wrote to a friend, a turkey is to be killed for our dinners by the electrical shock

552
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:07,000
 and roasted by the electrical jack, and he practiced it lots, and then got a crowd together,

553
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:11,000
 and he was numb for the rest of the evening after he gave himself a huge shock,

554
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:16,000
 and he wrote to his brother, saying, "Two nights ago, being about to kill a turkey by the shock from two large glass jars,

555
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,000
 I inadvertently took the hole through my own arms and body.

556
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:23,000
 Do not make this more public, for I am ashamed to have been guilty of so notorious of Blunder.

557
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:27,000
 So sorry, Franklin, your secrets out now."

558
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:32,000
 The other thing, though, is that turkeys aren't that noble, are they?

559
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
 Really.

560
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:39,000
 I mean, if you put a male turkey, apparently, in a room with a model of female turkey,

561
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:44,000
 he'll mate with it just as eagerly as he would with the real thing.

562
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:48,000
 But he will also do it if you put a turkey head on a stick.

563
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
 He'll also try and mate with that.

564
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
 Really?

565
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
 Yeah.

566
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:56,000
 And they did an experiment with all the different bits of a turkey that which will work and which won't work.

567
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,000
 A freshly severed head on a stick was the most effective.

568
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
 That's what it liked the most.

569
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
 What was the most effective?

570
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
 Well, I like you, but I don't know.

571
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,000
 Could you maybe lose everything below your neck?

572
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:13,000
 Well, yeah, you've got that one's the most effective, followed by a dried male head on a stick,

573
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:17,000
 followed by a two-year-old withered female head on a stick.

574
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
 It's turkey porn just heads.

575
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
 It's like breasts.

576
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
 Just cut out the body.

577
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:31,000
 And then last place, but still enlisting a sexual response was a plain balsa wood model of a head.

578
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
 They're Andy.

579
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:36,000
 This nude just got very slightly bigger.

580
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
 Wow.

581
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,000
 That's what you're emblem of the USA.

582
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
 Tuckies never ask you, you're a leg or a breast man.

583
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
 They just say you're a head or a head man.

584
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
 I'm a head man.

585
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
 Yeah, I love it.

586
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:49,000
 When was this done, do you know?

587
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:54,000
 It was done in the late '50s by some people at the University of Pennsylvania.

588
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
 Oh, my God.

589
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
 The perverts in the University of Pennsylvania.

590
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:01,000
 You know when they say they're cutting science budgets around the world?

591
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,000
 You're just going, but we need to put these rats in braziers.

592
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:08,000
 And we've been trying to find out if he wants to shag that head.

593
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
 I kind of get it now.

594
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,000
 I've had this had decomposing for two years in my office.

595
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:17,000
 We all think it's going to the mood in bars, and it's there.

596
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,000
 That's where the real budget's going.

597
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
 Wow.

598
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
 Tuckies aren't very breasty now, aren't they?

599
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
 Much more than they're supposed to be.

600
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
 Well, I mean these.

601
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
 Have noticed, yeah, we were chatting about this the other day.

602
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
 Yeah, no, I saw your computer screens.

603
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:34,000
 They've increased.

604
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,000
 It was the weight trope's website.

605
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:41,000
 Look at the head on that one.

606
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,000
 Go on.

607
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
 Tuckies have got much bigger.

608
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,000
 They've increased by 57% in size since 1980.

609
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,000
 I think.

610
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,000
 Because, I know since 1965, sorry.

611
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:56,000
 Because we're obviously breeding them to have huge breasts,

612
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
 because we like the taste of turkey breasts.

613
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,000
 So while turkeys are laughing in the face of domestic turkeys,

614
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,000
 because they can fly, they can fly 55 miles an hour, I think.

615
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
 Wow.

616
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
 And most domesticated turkeys can't fly at all,

617
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
 because they're so top-heavy.

618
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,000
 They can run 25 miles an hour.

619
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
 Yeah, unbelievable.

620
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
 Wild turkeys.

621
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
 Yeah, wild turkeys.

622
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:19,000
 Turkeys can't, farm turkeys can't have sex with each other anymore.

623
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
 It's quite sad.

624
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:24,000
 They're too heavy, and they're sort of a bit distorted.

625
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,000
 And they have to be masturbated.

626
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
 And then artificially inseminated.

627
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,000
 And the people who...

628
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
 Is it not because they're all dubious now going?

629
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
 It's probably just a head on a stick, mate.

630
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
 I wouldn't want that.

631
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
 But the people who do it call it milking.

632
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
 And it's not milking.

633
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
 It's not milking.

634
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
 Don't dress it up.

635
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
 They then...

636
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
 All right.

637
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
 They sort of...

638
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
 Can I read you a brief account of it?

639
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:52,000
 It won't take long, but the effects will last forever in your mind.

640
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,000
 So this is according to a journalist who went around and visited a turkey farmer.

641
00:25:55,000 --> 00:26:01,000
 He said, "I was complaining about the impossibility of a journalist getting to see the process when I heard a rustle of feathers beside me.

642
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:04,000
 The turkey was already upside down in Paul's hands.

643
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,000
 He swiftly uncovered a hole amidst the feathers, gave it a couple of tweaks.

644
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:11,000
 And there was the turkey semen, looking at like a bit of crumbly old toothpaste.

645
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:15,000
 "We take this," said Paul, "and suck it into a rubber tube.

646
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
 It's then blown into the vagina.

647
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:22,000
 So you have to suck it up with a rubber tube, and then blow it up another turkey."

648
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,000
 That's a job.

649
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
 I hope they didn't...

650
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
 That's a job that people actually don't have.

651
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
 So what makes you think you're called by?

652
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:33,000
 Well, I've always been interested in sucking animal semen up through tubes.

653
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:38,000
 They didn't say the crumbly old toothpaste thing to its face, did they?

654
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:42,000
 Because that may tend to be quite offensive, in my experience.

655
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:47,000
 So...

656
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
 Do you have any aquafresh?

657
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,000
 Hey, I read that turkey poo.

658
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:58,000
 Let's say you had two turkeys, and you were like, "Oh, tell me the gender of these two turkeys."

659
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,000
 You can tell which one is a male, and which one is female by their poo.

660
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:06,000
 Because the poo of a male turkey comes out spiral, like a Mr. Whippy ice cream.

661
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
 It comes out just like a...

662
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
 But it does. That's the kind of way that it comes out.

663
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,000
 And then a female poo comes out in the shape of a "J."

664
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:18,000
 Yeah, so that's how you know, because they have different...

665
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
 Is this right, James? They've got different eggs.

666
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,000
 Oh, clockers, yeah. They have different shape clockers.

667
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:26,000
 Another good turkey thing, which I actually discovered last year,

668
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:30,000
 and is in our fact book, one for one, one for facts to knock you sideways.

669
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
 If you want to buy it, is that...

670
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,000
 So in turkey, the word for turkey means Indian bird.

671
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:38,000
 In Indian, the word for turkey means Peruvian bird.

672
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,000
 In Greece, the word for turkey means French bird.

673
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,000
 And in Malaysia, the word for turkey means Dutch chicken.

674
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,000
 So no one had a clue where it was coming from.

675
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
 But it was definitely foreign.

676
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:52,000
 It was a foreign bird.

677
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,000
 Well, there's a theory that they were called turkeys here,

678
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:59,000
 because the merchants who sold them across Europe were Turkish.

679
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
 But of course, they're all native to Mexico.

680
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:04,000
 I was going to say the Native Americans, apparently,

681
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,000
 the real origin of the name is "Furkey."

682
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
 So they should be "Furkeys," not turkeys.

683
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
 Oh, okay. I didn't know that. Let's go.

684
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
 Let's start calling them that.

685
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
 Hashtag facts.

686
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:19,000
 We should move on. Time to move on to our final fact of the evening,

687
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
 and that is Andy.

688
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:24,000
 My fact is that the composer of the song "Jingle Bells"

689
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,000
 also wrote the "Yuletide" classic "We Conquer or Die."

690
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:32,000
 That was a genuine song written by the same man.

691
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:36,000
 His name was James Lord Pierpont, and he was an American composer.

692
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:40,000
 He was also the uncle of JP Morgan, incidentally, the banker.

693
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:47,000
 And he wrote this song on a number of others, the lyrics to "We Conquer or Die."

694
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:50,000
 The war drum is beating. Prepare for the fight.

695
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
 The stern bigot Northman exalts in his might.

696
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,000
 Go on your bright weapons, your foemen are nigh,

697
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:58,000
 and this be our watchword, "We Conquer or Die."

698
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,000
 So there you go.

699
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:04,000
 You can see where it led on.

700
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:07,000
 Was that his difficult second song?

701
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
 Which one came first, do we know?

702
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
 I think "Jingle Bells" came first.

703
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
 Some of them we don't know the dates for.

704
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
 I know, he's like someone who wanted to be taken more seriously.

705
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
 On those cases.

706
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
 Did he write anything else? Is that it, premier?

707
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
 Yeah, he wrote a lot of songs.

708
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:24,000
 Are they all in the Christmas theme or the Aggressive Military theme?

709
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
 A lot of them are in the Aggressive Military theme.

710
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
 We wrote our battle flag and strike for the south.

711
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:32,000
 And oh, let me not neglect it, die.

712
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:36,000
 Because he was on the side of the south in the Civil War.

713
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,000
 And he lived in Boston, Massachusetts originally,

714
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:42,000
 and then he moved down to Savannah, Georgia,

715
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
 which is where he spent the Civil War.

716
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,000
 And he wrote a load of these songs on behalf of the south.

717
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
 There's a kind of agit prop thing.

718
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
 "Jingle Bells" was the first song to be played from space.

719
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,000
 Wasn't it?

720
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,000
 Wasn't it?

721
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,000
 Yeah, yeah, it was.

722
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,000
 Really?

723
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:59,000
 It was when Tom Stafford and Wally Scherer were in space.

724
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
 It was in 1965.

725
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,000
 I think.

726
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,000
 And it was a prank.

727
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:07,000
 So they said they'd seen a kind of floating asteroid

728
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
 or something they were talking to, you know,

729
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
 mission control, whatever on the ground, floating,

730
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
 and they were going to get it and see what it was,

731
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
 and it turned out to be this tiny harmonica.

732
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
 It was three eighths of an inch wide,

733
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:20,000
 and then they launched into a rendition of "Jingle Bells"

734
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
 around Christmas time from space.

735
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:26,000
 They had originally planned to play "We Conqueror Die."

736
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
 They couldn't get the rights.

737
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:32,000
 So they pretended that they saw Santa Claus, is that right?

738
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,000
 Did you say that?

739
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,000
 No.

740
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,000
 So that's what happened.

741
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
 They kind of went down to mission control and said,

742
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:41,000
 "We can see this one guy with 12 other figures flying

743
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,000
 into the Earth's atmosphere."

744
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
 And they pretended that they could see Father Christmas.

745
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,000
 Was that what it was supposed to be?

746
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
 I just saw them saying they thought it was a satellite.

747
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:51,000
 No, he said, "I see a command module with eight smaller modules

748
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,000
 in front.

749
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:55,000
 The pilots of the command module is wearing a red suit."

750
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:58,000
 There's a lot of sort of Christmassy elements

751
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,000
 to space travel.

752
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:02,000
 They're lying and lying from up there.

753
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,000
 That makes me wonder about the whole moon landing's conspiracy theory

754
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:08,000
 if they're claiming Santa Claus was there.

755
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,000
 So some other carols.

756
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,000
 They saw three ships.

757
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,000
 You know that song?

758
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,000
 Oh, yes.

759
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,000
 They saw three ships.

760
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,000
 There's an extra verse about that.

761
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,000
 We don't really sing anymore.

762
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:20,000
 We talk about carrying the dead bodies of the three wise men

763
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,000
 on the ships.

764
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,000
 How did they die?

765
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,000
 I don't say natural causes.

766
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:30,000
 Yes, so the idea was that these three wise men were on the boats

767
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
 and they'd sailed all the way from Bethlehem.

768
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,000
 Now, the problem is that Bethlehem isn't on the coast.

769
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:38,000
 But people in Britain didn't really know where Bethlehem was

770
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,000
 or in Europe.

771
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,000
 They didn't know.

772
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
 They just assumed it was like a seaside resort.

773
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
 And so the part of the song goes,

774
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,000
 it sailed from Bethlehem to Cologne, I think it was.

775
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,000
 But how could it do that?

776
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
 The each on one ship.

777
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,000
 Yeah, one in each ship.

778
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,000
 Let it snow.

779
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,000
 Let it snow.

780
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,000
 Let it snow.

781
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:57,000
 It was written by Sami Khan and Jules Stein.

782
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:00,000
 They claimed they came up with the idea to call themselves

783
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,000
 during a heat wave by writing the song.

784
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
 I don't really see how that works though.

785
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:08,000
 I'm dreaming of a white Christmas was written,

786
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,000
 I think, next to a swimming pool.

787
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,000
 Oh, really?

788
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,000
 I think so, yeah.

789
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:14,000
 The people find it was Irving Bellin wrote "White Christmas", didn't he?

790
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,000
 Yeah.

791
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:18,000
 And he was Jewish and he wrote it as a sort of an ironic song.

792
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:22,000
 And they recently did a poll in America

793
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
 of people's top 25 favorite Christmas songs,

794
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
 and more than half of them are written by Jewish people.

795
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,000
 And these are the guys who are writing all the great Christmas songs.

796
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
 You know the last year,

797
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,000
 it was either last year that you were before.

798
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,000
 Cost of coffee did a poll amongst their customers

799
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:39,000
 of what they think is the worst Christmas song that's ever been written.

800
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
 You know what came out on top?

801
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,000
 Oh, I don't know.

802
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
 It was not Cliff Richards.

803
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,000
 It's a total lie.

804
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,000
 It's a total lie.

805
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
 And they've now banned it.

806
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:55,000
 Yeah, worldwide, they've not allowed any of their coffee shops to play Cliff Richards' song anymore.

807
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
 Well, Irving Bellin tried to get radio stations

808
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
 to ban Elvis Presley's version of "White Christmas".

809
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,000
 Did he?

810
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,000
 Because I thought it was...

811
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
 I think his exact words were,

812
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:06,000
 it's a profane parody of his cherished Jules Tide standard.

813
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:10,000
 He ordered staff in New York to...

814
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
 Oh, he ordered his own staff to phone radio stations,

815
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,000
 they don't play this,

816
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
 because he thought it was so outrageously gross.

817
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
 Why was it gross?

818
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,000
 Was it too much?

819
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
 I think it was too sexy.

820
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,000
 I don't know.

821
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
 Elvis Presley, a lot of radio stations,

822
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:26,000
 refused to play Elvis Presley's songs when he first became popular

823
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
 because they assumed that he was black,

824
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
 and it was the time when...

825
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,000
 God.

826
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,000
 Yeah.

827
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,000
 Well, they also banned him.

828
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,000
 I don't know if this is a myth,

829
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,000
 but it might be a myth.

830
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,000
 Is it a myth?

831
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,000
 No, I think it's not a myth.

832
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:41,000
 They could only film him sort of torso above.

833
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,000
 They couldn't show his legs,

834
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
 because his legs were too sexy and the dance moves.

835
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,000
 Yeah.

836
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,000
 He was just shaking too much.

837
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,000
 Well, it was mostly his hips.

838
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,000
 Yeah, mostly his hips.

839
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,000
 Yeah, legs are not the problem.

840
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,000
 Yeah, yeah.

841
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,000
 He's got to cut out that, like...

842
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,000
 Where's one line?

843
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,000
 Yeah.

844
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,000
 You can do below the knees, guys,

845
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,000
 or you can do above the waist.

846
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,000
 Yeah.

847
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,000
 Whereas on Turkey, top of the pop,

848
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,000
 they cut off the head.

849
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,000
 (LAUGHTER)

850
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,000
 To see the body.

851
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,000
 That's all you get.

852
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:05,000
 Rudolf Redner's Renda was nearly called "regional."

853
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
 (LAUGHTER)

854
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,000
 Regional?

855
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,000
 Yeah, it doesn't scan as well.

856
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,000
 But it wasn't a song originally.

857
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
 It was a coloring book for children,

858
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
 and an advertising guy came up with it,

859
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
 and he very nearly called it "regional,"

860
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,000
 but then he crucially didn't.

861
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:20,000
 And it sold two and a half million copies in its first year.

862
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,000
 There's a little coloring book.

863
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,000
 It's huge.

864
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
 Which is quite nice about Rudolf Redner's Renda.

865
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
 It was written by just a copywriter

866
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
 who worked for Montgomery Award,

867
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,000
 huge department store,

868
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
 and they'd just been told they didn't want to spend

869
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
 those money buying in Christmas gifts to sell,

870
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
 so they told their staff to write a Christmas song.

871
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:39,000
 So this guy, Robert May, wrote Rudolf Redner's Renda.

872
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:43,000
 And it sold incredibly well-matched loads of money.

873
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
 I think it was remitted into a song.

874
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:48,000
 And the Montgomery Award, people in charge of Montgomery Award,

875
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,000
 gave him all the rights to it.

876
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,000
 He had no rights to it at all.

877
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,000
 Wow.

878
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,000
 And he was in trouble.

879
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,000
 His wife had a terminal illness.

880
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
 He was in massive debt.

881
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
 And as soon as it was released as a song,

882
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
 they sold him all the rights to it, 100%.

883
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:02,000
 And he loved off the proceeds of that until, I think, 1970s when he died.

884
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,000
 Wow.

885
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,000
 So that's quite nice.

886
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,000
 That is nice. That's great.

887
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,000
 Yeah.

888
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
 "Hark the Herald Angels" sing,

889
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,000
 "The Tune" is written by Mendelssohn,

890
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,000
 which possibly you know,

891
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:16,000
 and Mendelssohn originally wrote the tune as a tribute to Gutenberg's printing press.

892
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,000
 Yeah.

893
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:20,000
 It was, how awesome is the printing press song?

894
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
 How awesome is the printing press?

895
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
 It sounds the same as "Hark the Herald Angels" sing.

896
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,000
 Yeah, that's the original one.

897
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
 It actually went "Gutenberg, the Deutsche Mann"

898
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
 "Zundetter, die Fickle Am"

899
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,000
 or "Die Fackle Am".

900
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
 I have no idea.

901
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:35,000
 So the weirdest thing for me about this fact

902
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:38,000
 is when you hear someone who's famous for something

903
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
 and then they've produced another bit of work

904
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:44,000
 that is just so, you know, jingle bells, we conquer or die.

905
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
 It's just so different.

906
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:50,000
 It's like when I found out that Barbara Cartland invented a glider

907
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
 that the military started using.

908
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,000
 Sorry, what?

909
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:57,000
 Barbara Cartland, the romance novelist who wrote a billion romance novels,

910
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:00,000
 also invented a glider that you could fly in,

911
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,000
 that the military was like, that is so good we're using it.

912
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
 And that's one of her...

913
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:08,000
 Yeah, that's a thing that...

914
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:14,000
 And Michael Jackson invented the facts machine.

915
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
 No, Michael Jackson.

916
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
 Actually, I don't know if most people know this,

917
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:21,000
 but he wrote the song "Do the Bart Man", the Michael Jackson's.

918
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
 Everyone does know that.

919
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
 But he wrote the Simpson song "Do the Bart Man".

920
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,000
 Really?

921
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:29,000
 And he invented those shoes that let you kind of stand on a slant as well.

922
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,000
 Yeah, he did actually.

923
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,000
 He was a part of the...

924
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
 When he slants forward, there's a patent taken out

925
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:36,000
 where it's weighted boots, and he was one of the invented shoes.

926
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:40,000
 There's not a nut like this is a kind of shoe that's really caught on since then.

927
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,000
 What was you talking about?

928
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,000
 We're all wearing them.

929
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,000
 We're all wearing them now.

930
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,000
 So I've walked over like that.

931
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
 This is connected because I wanted to mention this earlier.

932
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:51,000
 The person who made Christmas carols cool again was St. Francis of Assisi.

933
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,000
 Also, I believe.

934
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:56,000
 Yes, so it was at a time when it was in the 13th century,

935
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:01,000
 at a time when it was all like very serious and very somber.

936
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:04,000
 And he tried to make Christmas celebrations fun again.

937
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:10,000
 And he made it so that, for instance, drinking songs that were sung in taverns,

938
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,000
 like fun drinking songs.

939
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:15,000
 He made them be rewritten with Christmas lyrics.

940
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,000
 And actually...

941
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:21,000
 A few years ago, the Pope said that he was a playboy, Francis of Assisi.

942
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,000
 What do you mean?

943
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,000
 Well, he started off his life.

944
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,000
 He was a drinker and he was a partier.

945
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
 And then he gave away all this stuff to a leper.

946
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:29,000
 And the Pope actually said that he was one of the original playboys.

947
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
 Fun guy.

948
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,000
 Created an activity, I think.

949
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
 He turned an activity into a fun theatrical event.

950
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:38,000
 So decided that the birth of Jesus should be something that we all go and enjoy watching.

951
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:41,000
 The Vatican didn't have a Christmas tree until 1982.

952
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,000
 Did it not?

953
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,000
 No.

954
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
 I think they associated it with being the old heathen thing.

955
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,000
 Wow.

956
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,000
 Yeah.

957
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
 There's a thing in America where you call them holiday trees.

958
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:54,000
 I just read this really random report where there was a guy who...

959
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,000
 he was a politician who died.

960
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,000
 He had a previous career.

961
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
 I can't quite remember what his previous career was.

962
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:01,000
 And when he died, apparently it was just such a big thing in his life.

963
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:04,000
 He hated the idea that things were called holiday trees.

964
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,000
 And he wanted to be called Christmas trees.

965
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:09,000
 That when Arnold Schwarzenegger spoke at his funeral, he said,

966
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:13,000
 "I swear I will make the Christmas tree return."

967
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
 It was the report that came out.

968
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:21,000
 Arnold Schwarzenegger promises Christmas trees to return in funeral eulogy.

969
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
 We need to wrap up.

970
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,000
 Do you guys have any...

971
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,000
 Yeah, yeah.

972
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:28,000
 Well, was originally a bit of a saucy song.

973
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
 I just wanted to tell you that.

974
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
 The second verse, it goes,

975
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
 "A day or two ago, I thought I'd take a ride.

976
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:37,000
 And soon Miss Fanny Bright was seated by my side.

977
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
 The horse was lean and lank.

978
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,000
 Miss Fortune seemed as lot.

979
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:43,000
 He got into a drifted bank and then we got up-sought.

980
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:46,000
 Which no one knows what it means.

981
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:49,000
 But...

982
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:52,000
 It sounds like it should be upset, but it didn't quite run.

983
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
 I think that's exactly what it means, actually.

984
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,000
 Yeah.

985
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
 And then now the ground is white.

986
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,000
 Go it while you're young.

987
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
 Take the girls tonight and sing this song.

988
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,000
 Basically, a sleigh was like having a sweet ride in the fifties.

989
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
 And you'd go and sleigh everywhere.

990
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
 And you'd go up into the hills up to...

991
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:10,000
 Going to sleigh everywhere sounds a bit like some kind of gory.

992
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,000
 Yeah.

993
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
 You don't want to be involved with...

994
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,000
 But you go sleigh riding.

995
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
 You know, that was very impressive to a young lady.

996
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,000
 You've got a sleigh.

997
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,000
 Four.

998
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,000
 I have a...

999
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,000
 Or just one more thing to add.

1000
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:25,000
 Which is more of a feminist mission statement about the Holly and the Ivy.

1001
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
 And the Holly and the Ivy, the song.

1002
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
 So it's always kind of bugged me how...

1003
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:33,000
 You know how that ends, saying of all the trees that are in there with the Holly bears, the crown.

1004
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
 So in the Holly and the Ivy, the Holly's won.

1005
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:38,000
 And the Holly's a bit of a dick because it's all spiky and nasty.

1006
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:44,000
 And actually, this dates back to medieval times when the Holly represented the masculinity of the male form.

1007
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,000
 And the Ivy was a woman.

1008
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
 The Ivy was this weak gentle woman.

1009
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:50,000
 The Holly was this strong and it's very resilient and it represented a man.

1010
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:55,000
 And in medieval villages, they were seeing the women would sing, have competitions against the men.

1011
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
 And they would be the Ivy and the men would be the Holly.

1012
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:00,000
 So every time women, you sing the Holly and the Ivy.

1013
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
 And you finish saying the Holly bears the crown.

1014
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
 You're saying the men of one.

1015
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
 That's what that means.

1016
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,000
 So we need to change it, don't we?

1017
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,000
 We need to change it.

1018
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
 Get Arnold Schwarzenegger on the phone.

1019
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
 [laughter]

1020
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
 I swear to you, Anna.

1021
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:17,000
 The Ivy will rise again.

1022
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:22,000
 [applause]

1023
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,000
 Okay, that's it.

1024
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
