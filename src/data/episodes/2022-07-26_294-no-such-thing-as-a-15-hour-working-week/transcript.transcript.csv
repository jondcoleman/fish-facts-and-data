00:00:00,00:00:02,"- Hi everyone, before we start this week's show,"
00:00:02,00:00:04,we want to tell you about the winners
00:00:04,00:00:07,of this year's prestigious Heinz Oberhummer Award
00:00:07,00:00:09,for Science Communication.
00:00:09,00:00:11,"- That's exciting, okay, who got it?"
00:00:11,00:00:13,"- Us, no."
00:00:13,00:00:15,"- Yes, that is amazing."
00:00:15,00:00:16,- It's so cool.
00:00:16,00:00:18,And what it means is that we get to go to Vienna
00:00:18,00:00:20,and we're gonna record a podcast there
00:00:20,00:00:23,and it's gonna be a 300th episode
00:00:23,00:00:25,"and guess what, you can get tickets."
00:00:25,00:00:26,- That was the funniest piece of acting I've ever seen
00:00:26,00:00:28,"there at the start, by the way, guys."
00:00:28,00:00:29,But that is indeed correct.
00:00:29,00:00:31,If you are listening from Vienna or Austria
00:00:31,00:00:33,"or if you fancy a trip there on the 25th of November,"
00:00:33,00:00:36,then go to nosuchthingasaffish.com
00:00:36,00:00:38,and you'll see the link there to get tickets
00:00:38,00:00:40,and see us perform our 300th episode.
00:00:40,00:00:43,- Is this in the world I see before me?
00:00:43,00:00:43,"- No, I'll go."
00:00:43,00:00:45,"- Oh, that was good."
00:00:45,00:00:46,"- Now, pipe down on with the show."
00:00:46,00:00:49,(blues music)
00:00:49,00:00:50,- Who the fuck is this?
00:00:50,00:00:53,(blues music)
00:00:53,00:01:01,- Who's not ready?
00:01:01,00:01:03,"- I'm not ready, but Karen's not ready."
00:01:03,00:01:04,- Karen's not ready.
00:01:04,00:01:06,- Hello and welcome to another episode
00:01:06,00:01:09,"of nosuchthingasaffish, a weekly podcast"
00:01:09,00:01:12,coming to you from the QI offices in Covert Garden.
00:01:12,00:01:13,My name is Dan Schreiber.
00:01:13,00:01:15,"I am sitting here with Anna Chazinski,"
00:01:15,00:01:17,Andrew Hunter Murray and James Harkin.
00:01:17,00:01:20,"And once again, we have gathered around the microphones"
00:01:20,00:01:22,with our four favorite facts from the last seven days
00:01:22,00:01:26,"and in no particular order, here we go."
00:01:26,00:01:28,"Starting with you, James."
00:01:28,00:01:30,"- Oh, it really?"
00:01:30,00:01:31,I thought it was what are you guys first?
00:01:31,00:01:37,"- My fact this week is that the US Navy's Doomsday aircraft,"
00:01:37,00:01:40,"which was designed to survive a nuclear attack,"
00:01:40,00:01:42,was recently taken out by a single bird.
00:01:42,00:01:46,"Okay, this was in the news."
00:01:46,00:01:48,A few people might have seen it.
00:01:48,00:01:51,The US Navy called it a class A mishap.
00:01:51,00:01:53,(laughing)
00:01:53,00:01:56,- That feels like something that would be an PG Woodhouse novel.
00:01:56,00:01:57,"- I'm telling you what, jeez,"
00:01:57,00:01:58,this is a class A mishap we've just had.
00:01:58,00:02:02,- It was the E6B Mercury.
00:02:02,00:02:06,"It's a Boeing 707, which supposedly,"
00:02:06,00:02:08,"if there is a nuclear bomb that goes off nearby,"
00:02:08,00:02:10,it's supposed to be okay.
00:02:10,00:02:12,"But actually, a bird got into its engine"
00:02:12,00:02:15,and it had to make an emergency stop.
00:02:15,00:02:17,The engine had to be replaced and it cost them
00:02:17,00:02:19,about $2 million.
00:02:19,00:02:20,"- Oh, wow."
00:02:20,00:02:22,- That is a class A mishap.
00:02:22,00:02:23,- That is.
00:02:23,00:02:24,And so I was really curious about this plane
00:02:24,00:02:28,"because it's sort of, it's like the less fancy,"
00:02:28,00:02:30,"but tougher brother of Air Force One, basically."
00:02:30,00:02:32,"- Yeah, although Air Force One is anything"
00:02:32,00:02:33,"that the president's on, of course."
00:02:33,00:02:34,- Yes.
00:02:34,00:02:36,"- But the particular Air Force One that we know about,"
00:02:36,00:02:39,"yeah, it's a souped-up version of this one."
00:02:39,00:02:42,"- Yeah, it's all nuclear command centers"
00:02:42,00:02:45,as opposed to nice beds and desks and cool press rooms
00:02:45,00:02:46,and things like that.
00:02:46,00:02:49,"But I wonder, 'cause it's, I read this,"
00:02:49,00:02:51,I couldn't believe that it could survive a nuclear attack.
00:02:51,00:02:53,And they say it can survive a nuclear attack.
00:02:53,00:02:55,When I just wonder how close it can be
00:02:55,00:02:56,for a nuclear attack.
00:02:56,00:02:58,"'Cause if you drop a nuclear bomb on it, it would,"
00:02:58,00:02:59,- Yeah.
00:02:59,00:03:02,"- In many ways, you know, most of the people in the world"
00:03:02,00:03:06,could survive a nuclear attack depending on where the bomb is.
00:03:06,00:03:08,"- Yeah, that's absolutely true."
00:03:08,00:03:10,"- If a bomb stops in Australia, I reckon I'll be okay."
00:03:10,00:03:13,"- They said it was, they said they've got all sorts of,"
00:03:13,00:03:15,I read they had mesh to prevent radiation
00:03:15,00:03:16,and other things.
00:03:16,00:03:17,"- Yeah, they have that, you know."
00:03:17,00:03:20,"- And also, it's strong enough to survive the pulses"
00:03:20,00:03:23,of electromagnetic energy that come from a nuclear bomb.
00:03:23,00:03:24,"- Oh, okay."
00:03:24,00:03:26,"- Cosumably, like you say, not if it lands on the nose."
00:03:26,00:03:27,(laughing)
00:03:27,00:03:28,I do see what you mean by that.
00:03:28,00:03:31,"- Maybe it's 'cause it can only flyably for about 10 hours,"
00:03:31,00:03:33,10 hours worth of fuel.
00:03:33,00:03:35,So maybe it has to make a landing in an area
00:03:35,00:03:37,that's been recently bombed and all this meshing and stuff
00:03:37,00:03:40,means that you would survive on the inside
00:03:40,00:03:43,and not be turned into radioactive spider.
00:03:43,00:03:45,(laughing)
00:03:45,00:03:46,- I lost my thread at the end there.
00:03:46,00:03:47,"- No, you couldn't tell."
00:03:47,00:03:49,(laughing)
00:03:49,00:03:50,They are very cool.
00:03:50,00:03:51,- Yeah.
00:03:51,00:03:52,- Do we know what kind of bird it was?
00:03:52,00:03:53,Was it at least a big bird?
00:03:53,00:03:55,"- We don't know what kind of, it was a big bird"
00:03:55,00:03:57,"from Sesame Street, if that's what you're thinking."
00:03:57,00:03:58,- Thank God.
00:03:58,00:04:00,- Famously can't fly.
00:04:00,00:04:01,We don't know what kind of bird it is.
00:04:01,00:04:04,Although they have lots of labs in America
00:04:04,00:04:06,who can find this kind of thing out.
00:04:06,00:04:09,"They like to scrape bits of bird off airplanes, don't they?"
00:04:09,00:04:10,And work out what's.
00:04:10,00:04:13,"- Yeah, using the DNA, they'll do it."
00:04:13,00:04:14,And you just send in.
00:04:14,00:04:17,"There's a thing called, if you have a bird strike"
00:04:17,00:04:19,"on your plane, it's called snarge."
00:04:19,00:04:21,"- Snarge, so there's, yeah, that's right."
00:04:21,00:04:23,- And I wanted to know where this word came from.
00:04:23,00:04:24,Did anyone find out?
00:04:24,00:04:24,- No.
00:04:24,00:04:25,"- Okay, as far as I can see,"
00:04:25,00:04:27,it comes from the Smithsonian Institution's
00:04:27,00:04:29,feather identification laboratory.
00:04:29,00:04:32,And I think just the lab sciences have just called it snarge
00:04:32,00:04:34,"and it feels like it might be an acronym or something,"
00:04:34,00:04:36,but I don't really know.
00:04:36,00:04:38,"And when they first came up with it, one of the other words"
00:04:38,00:04:40,of phrases they used was birdic.
00:04:40,00:04:42,- Snarge is quite onomatopoeic.
00:04:42,00:04:43,"I don't imagine they just sort of thought,"
00:04:43,00:04:46,"""Oh, this sound sort of tells you that it's..."
00:04:46,00:04:48,"- It's a gooey end."""
00:04:48,00:04:49,"- Yeah, maybe snarge."
00:04:49,00:04:51,- Snarge.
00:04:51,00:04:54,"- And in this lab, they will test things and work out"
00:04:54,00:04:57,exactly what will happen when any bird hits any aircraft.
00:04:57,00:05:01,And they have invented the bird avoidance model
00:05:01,00:05:02,or bam!
00:05:02,00:05:04,- Nice.
00:05:04,00:05:05,- Very cool.
00:05:05,00:05:08,This isn't the only bird strike that hit a military plane
00:05:08,00:05:10,this year with scary consequences.
00:05:10,00:05:13,"Yeah, so earlier this year, an Air Force A10 was flying"
00:05:13,00:05:17,"through America over Florida and it got hit by a bird as well,"
00:05:17,00:05:18,hit the engine.
00:05:18,00:05:20,"But as a result of being hit by the bird,"
00:05:20,00:05:23,something in the plane malfunctioned and it ended up
00:05:23,00:05:26,"dropping three dummy rounds, basically three massive bombs,"
00:05:26,00:05:31,but they weren't charged over Florida and landed in Florida.
00:05:31,00:05:34,"And I mean, it was just so lucky that they were fake bombs."
00:05:34,00:05:36,Because otherwise America would have just bombed its citizens.
00:05:36,00:05:39,And then I read that story and I think if you'd have gone up to it
00:05:39,00:05:41,"and started prodding it with a stick, you could have got injured."
00:05:41,00:05:42,- Yes.
00:05:42,00:05:43,"- That one people not to go near it, right?"
00:05:43,00:05:44,- Exactly.
00:05:44,00:05:45,- You're still slightly charged.
00:05:45,00:05:47,"- Yeah, they're like, this is completely harmless."
00:05:47,00:05:50,"It's just the dummy bomb, but also please do not handle it"
00:05:50,00:05:51,under any circumstances.
00:05:51,00:05:53,"So if you are, and I don't know if they've found them."
00:05:53,00:05:54,"So if you are in Florida and you see,"
00:05:54,00:05:55,I think they're about 25 pounds.
00:05:55,00:05:59,"So they are quite, they're not huge, but in those spot ones."
00:05:59,00:06:01,"- Well, they said where it is, roughly."
00:06:01,00:06:05,They said that in the general vicinity of two kilometers west
00:06:05,00:06:07,"of highway one, two, nine, every single location."
00:06:07,00:06:10,"But that's quite a big margin of error, I would say."
00:06:10,00:06:11,- Yeah.
00:06:11,00:06:12,- Yeah.
00:06:12,00:06:14,Can we just say one more thing about these weird planes?
00:06:14,00:06:15,"- Yes, ma'am."
00:06:15,00:06:18,- So they're called the National Airborne Operation Centers.
00:06:18,00:06:21,"And these are the ones, I don't know if you guys remember,"
00:06:21,00:06:23,"but we spoke, I mentioned them a while ago,"
00:06:23,00:06:26,and you guys did not believe the fact that I said.
00:06:26,00:06:26,- Okay.
00:06:26,00:06:29,- These are the ones which have antennas
00:06:29,00:06:30,which are five miles long.
00:06:30,00:06:31,"- Oh, yes."
00:06:31,00:06:32,"- Oh, you remember?"
00:06:32,00:06:33,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:06:33,00:06:34,- Have you checked that?
00:06:34,00:06:35,- Yeah.
00:06:35,00:06:36,"- That's a long kite string, basically."
00:06:36,00:06:37,- It's like a tail.
00:06:37,00:06:38,It's like the plane's tail.
00:06:38,00:06:39,Except planes already have tails.
00:06:39,00:06:41,- It's like a second tail.
00:06:41,00:06:42,- It's like a second tail.
00:06:42,00:06:43,- Yeah.
00:06:43,00:06:46,- And it's so it can communicate with submarines underwater.
00:06:46,00:06:48,- Because they need extremely long waves.
00:06:48,00:06:49,- Yeah.
00:06:49,00:06:50,- Exactly.
00:06:50,00:06:52,And the point of the plane is that they tie everything together.
00:06:52,00:06:55,"So they tie together the bombers,"
00:06:55,00:06:57,which have got nuclear weapons on them.
00:06:57,00:06:59,"They tie together submarines, which have got nuclear warheads,"
00:06:59,00:07:02,"and the ballistic missiles in their silos,"
00:07:02,00:07:04,they can communicate with all of those
00:07:04,00:07:07,and basically coordinate a nuclear attack
00:07:07,00:07:09,if America wants to make one.
00:07:09,00:07:09,- Yeah.
00:07:09,00:07:11,- Or if it's been attacked and they wanted to retaliate.
00:07:11,00:07:13,- What's amazing about these planes is that
00:07:13,00:07:16,they have a crew basically on standby waiting for Doomsday.
00:07:16,00:07:19,"They're just there, maintaining the plane,"
00:07:19,00:07:22,while the other three are getting prepared for their next round.
00:07:22,00:07:24,So they sort of swap spots as the ready plane.
00:07:24,00:07:26,"- So you come on your new shift and you go,"
00:07:26,00:07:28,"""All right, Jeff, was it Doomsday on your shift?"""
00:07:28,00:07:29,- Yeah.
00:07:29,00:07:30,"- No, it wasn't Doomsday on my shift."
00:07:30,00:07:32,"- All right, okay, we'll see you after, see you in eight hours."
00:07:32,00:07:33,- One day.
00:07:33,00:07:34,- Yeah.
00:07:34,00:07:37,"- Bird strikes, though, kind of a big problem"
00:07:37,00:07:38,"or a big thing that, you know,"
00:07:38,00:07:40,aircraft designers have to address.
00:07:40,00:07:42,And the first bird strike is sighted
00:07:42,00:07:45,as being Wilbur Wright of Wright Brothers' fame.
00:07:45,00:07:46,- To the right.
00:07:46,00:07:49,"- Yeah, and it was in 1905."
00:07:49,00:07:52,And it really raises my problem with the term bird strike
00:07:52,00:07:54,because it always gives too much agency to the birds.
00:07:54,00:07:57,"And so in this case, it was 1905."
00:07:57,00:07:59,So it was only a couple of years after the first ever
00:07:59,00:07:59,powered flight.
00:07:59,00:08:03,And Wilbur Wright was putling about in his plane.
00:08:03,00:08:05,"And he wrote in his diary,"
00:08:05,00:08:08,"""I twice passed over the fences into this bloke's cornfield"
00:08:08,00:08:12,and I chased flocks of birds on two rounds
00:08:12,00:08:15,and I managed to kill one in his engine
00:08:15,00:08:17,which then fell on top of the surface of the wing
00:08:17,00:08:19,"and fell off when he did a sharp curve."""
00:08:19,00:08:20,"So basically, he chased and harassed"
00:08:20,00:08:22,flocks of birds until he smashed into one
00:08:22,00:08:24,and then he dumped it off his wing.
00:08:24,00:08:26,And that's not a bird striking you.
00:08:26,00:08:27,- That's a plane strike.
00:08:27,00:08:28,- It's a plane strike.
00:08:28,00:08:29,- Yeah.
00:08:29,00:08:30,- I think that's what they should be called.
00:08:30,00:08:33,"- Do you, but then what if anything else hits the plane?"
00:08:33,00:08:35,"- It could, oh, it could should be called bird receipt."
00:08:35,00:08:36,(laughing)
00:08:36,00:08:39,"- Well, have you heard about the other kind of receipts"
00:08:39,00:08:41,"that they have, they have frog receipts,"
00:08:41,00:08:43,"they have turtle receipts, they have snake receipts."
00:08:43,00:08:44,"- Well, how high are those frogs jumping?"
00:08:44,00:08:45,"- It's amazing, right?"
00:08:45,00:08:50,"So according to these people who work at Smithsonian,"
00:08:50,00:08:53,"they get, because things get carried up by the jet stream,"
00:08:53,00:08:56,often animals other than birds get hit by these planes.
00:08:56,00:09:00,And they quite recently got a rabbit that got hit by a plane.
00:09:00,00:09:01,- No.
00:09:01,00:09:03,"- Yeah, so a rabbit receipt."
00:09:03,00:09:04,(laughing)
00:09:04,00:09:05,"- Sorry, how does the rabbit get into there?"
00:09:05,00:09:07,It's pulled up by the jet stream.
00:09:07,00:09:08,- By the jet stream.
00:09:08,00:09:09,- By the jet stream.
00:09:09,00:09:10,"- By, you know, a tornado or."
00:09:10,00:09:11,(laughing)
00:09:11,00:09:13,- It's really quite rare.
00:09:13,00:09:15,"- It sounds unlikely, doesn't it?"
00:09:15,00:09:17,But this was actually in a Smithsonian.
00:09:17,00:09:18,"- Well, you guys believe this,"
00:09:18,00:09:19,and you don't believe a plane can have a long antenna.
00:09:19,00:09:21,- I'm just trying to explore this a bit.
00:09:21,00:09:25,"- I think a lot of the animal sucks,"
00:09:25,00:09:27,"'cause they aren't, they are not called birds dry catchely"
00:09:27,00:09:28,by people in the aviation.
00:09:28,00:09:29,- They're called animals sucks.
00:09:29,00:09:30,- They're not called animals sucks.
00:09:30,00:09:31,(laughing)
00:09:31,00:09:33,"- They should be, they're called wildlife strikes,"
00:09:33,00:09:34,'cause of the variety.
00:09:34,00:09:36,But the other ones who aren't birds seem to be mostly
00:09:36,00:09:37,on runways.
00:09:37,00:09:39,"So in Florida, they have a bit of a crocodile problem,"
00:09:39,00:09:42,where I think one crocodile did actually jump up
00:09:42,00:09:43,and hit the wing of a plane.
00:09:43,00:09:47,"- It's a big crocodile jump, it flipped itself up to the level"
00:09:47,00:09:48,of the plane apparently.
00:09:48,00:09:49,- Wow.
00:09:49,00:09:50,- This is the thing that happens in Florida occasion.
00:09:50,00:09:52,"- I mean, there was one, I know what you're saying,"
00:09:52,00:09:54,"often on that, but this person who works"
00:09:54,00:09:57,at the Smithsonian Institution Feather Identification
00:09:57,00:10:01,Laboratory said that they had a cat that was hit
00:10:01,00:10:03,at high altitude.
00:10:03,00:10:04,- What?
00:10:04,00:10:05,- So such a shame.
00:10:05,00:10:07,Only eight lives left for that whole cat.
00:10:07,00:10:08,(laughing)
00:10:08,00:10:09,- Could have been on the back of a broomstick.
00:10:09,00:10:11,"- Could have been, who knows?"
00:10:11,00:10:12,Who knows how it got there?
00:10:12,00:10:14,- On the early airstrikes thing.
00:10:14,00:10:19,"Have you seen this amazing portrait of Eugene Gilbert,"
00:10:19,00:10:20,who was a French pilot.
00:10:20,00:10:23,"In 1911, he was flying from Paris to Madrid."
00:10:23,00:10:26,"So very early, exciting air race."
00:10:26,00:10:28,And he was flying over the Pyrenees Mountains.
00:10:28,00:10:31,And he got tangled up with an eagle.
00:10:31,00:10:33,There was a mother eagle which flew down
00:10:33,00:10:34,and attacked him basically.
00:10:34,00:10:37,'Cause she was very protective of her area.
00:10:37,00:10:39,And he started firing his pistol at it
00:10:39,00:10:41,from inside the cockpit of this.
00:10:41,00:10:42,"- Well, it must have been a biplane, I think."
00:10:42,00:10:44,Not to wound just to--
00:10:44,00:10:45,- Just to scare it.
00:10:45,00:10:46,"- To scare it off, yeah."
00:10:46,00:10:47,But someone who--
00:10:47,00:10:48,- Should have thrown a cat at it.
00:10:48,00:10:49,- Should have.
00:10:49,00:10:50,(laughing)
00:10:50,00:10:52,- But someone has painted a portrait of this happening.
00:10:52,00:10:54,And it's an incredibly epic picture.
00:10:54,00:10:56,"- Wow, that's amazing."
00:10:56,00:10:58,"- We should say it's really, really rare as well."
00:10:58,00:10:59,- Oh yeah.
00:10:59,00:11:03,"- So I think the amazing stat is that since 1912,"
00:11:03,00:11:05,there have been 250 deaths from bird strikes
00:11:05,00:11:07,due to all flights ever.
00:11:07,00:11:10,So it's incredibly unlikely.
00:11:10,00:11:12,But obviously still it is quite important to avoid them.
00:11:12,00:11:15,"And the testing, have we mentioned the chicken gun before?"
00:11:15,00:11:16,- I don't think we have.
00:11:16,00:11:17,- We have.
00:11:17,00:11:20,- So there used to be experiments on plane engines
00:11:20,00:11:22,in the testing phase where you would fire a bird
00:11:22,00:11:24,from a gas cannon into the engine
00:11:24,00:11:27,"and see what happened, basically."
00:11:27,00:11:30,"And they've now replaced it, Boo,"
00:11:30,00:11:35,"with a block of gelatin, which is the same density as,"
00:11:35,00:11:36,for example.
00:11:36,00:11:38,Checking's about example 'cause they're flightless.
00:11:38,00:11:39,"They're probably not gonna end up in the engines,"
00:11:39,00:11:42,"but yeah, as a goose."
00:11:42,00:11:45,"- Easy to get though, easier to pick up."
00:11:45,00:11:46,- Very true.
00:11:46,00:11:48,"- And they used to put frozen ones in, didn't they?"
00:11:48,00:11:50,"Because, and one theory was that,"
00:11:50,00:11:52,"well, there are a few reasons you might do that."
00:11:52,00:11:54,"One might be because a frozen one would be,"
00:11:54,00:11:57,basically as hard as a bird can be.
00:11:57,00:11:58,"You know, I'm gonna get harder bird"
00:11:58,00:11:59,than a frozen chicken.
00:11:59,00:12:01,- But you might as well then just do it with a rock.
00:12:01,00:12:02,Why isn't your frozen chicken?
00:12:02,00:12:04,"- Well, one of the reasons is because they thought"
00:12:04,00:12:07,"that if a bird was flying in and it was about to get hit,"
00:12:07,00:12:08,it might tense all of its muscles
00:12:08,00:12:10,'cause it thought it was gonna get hit
00:12:10,00:12:13,and that would be similar to a frozen chicken.
00:12:13,00:12:15,"- That seems exactly what you would do, isn't it?"
00:12:15,00:12:15,- That's what I would do.
00:12:15,00:12:16,- Yeah.
00:12:16,00:12:18,- But it is a stressful and situation to be in.
00:12:18,00:12:19,- Yeah.
00:12:19,00:12:22,"- You wouldn't relax and go floppy, even if you knew"
00:12:22,00:12:23,that was what you were supposed to do
00:12:23,00:12:25,to increase your chances of survival.
00:12:25,00:12:28,- Apparently these days most of the testing
00:12:28,00:12:30,is by computer simulation.
00:12:30,00:12:31,- That makes more sense.
00:12:31,00:12:32,"- It does make more sense, but for me,"
00:12:32,00:12:33,it's not good enough.
00:12:33,00:12:34,- No.
00:12:34,00:12:35,"- No, I want to be flying in a plane"
00:12:35,00:12:37,that's had a chicken fired at it.
00:12:37,00:12:40,- Do you know what it is that kills the plane?
00:12:40,00:12:42,- I would have thought it hits the engine
00:12:42,00:12:46,and then it snarges all up and then it can't spin around
00:12:46,00:12:48,that gets really hot and it sets on fire.
00:12:48,00:12:51,- Can I just quickly say excellent use of snarge?
00:12:51,00:12:54,- I don't think snarge is a verb.
00:12:54,00:12:57,"- I think it's any kind of word, yeah."
00:12:57,00:12:58,"- Yeah, right, fair enough."
00:12:58,00:13:01,- Does it accidentally make one blade smash into another blade
00:13:01,00:13:02,and then that causes all the...
00:13:02,00:13:05,"- Basically, it bends one blade in the engine."
00:13:05,00:13:07,So what they're trying to do when they throw the chicken
00:13:07,00:13:09,at it is make sure that the blades can withstand
00:13:09,00:13:11,the chicken blow without bending.
00:13:11,00:13:13,'Cause as soon as one bends and the engine stools.
00:13:13,00:13:16,But the worst thing that can happen is if it hits
00:13:16,00:13:18,or if something hits one of the fan blades in the engine
00:13:18,00:13:21,"or if there's just a bit of wear and tear and they snap,"
00:13:21,00:13:22,which does happen every few years.
00:13:22,00:13:25,And that's the main plane sort of hazard
00:13:25,00:13:27,that they're trying to test against
00:13:27,00:13:29,"because if one fan blade snaps,"
00:13:29,00:13:31,then it turns into kind of shrapnel.
00:13:31,00:13:32,"So it's spinning around really, really fast."
00:13:32,00:13:34,"It's inside the engine, turns into shrapnel"
00:13:34,00:13:35,and then it flies through the engine.
00:13:35,00:13:37,So it breaks the whole engine down.
00:13:37,00:13:40,"And so they have to do these, like most of the money goes"
00:13:40,00:13:44,into doing these crazy tests where they have these fans.
00:13:44,00:13:47,So like picture sort of a ceiling fan.
00:13:47,00:13:48,And each plane...
00:13:48,00:13:49,"- No, no, no, no."
00:13:49,00:13:49,(laughter)
00:13:49,00:13:52,- Just remember last week's podcast at the Mulan Rouge.
00:13:52,00:13:55,(laughter)
00:13:55,00:13:57,- You're not a plane spotter.
00:13:57,00:13:58,You're just a plane fan spotter.
00:13:58,00:14:02,Each blade costs about the same as like a luxury car
00:14:02,00:14:03,about 50 grand.
00:14:03,00:14:06,So each fan is worth about nine million dollars
00:14:06,00:14:08,'cause they're really special shapes.
00:14:08,00:14:10,"And they have to be an incredibly special light,"
00:14:10,00:14:11,but strong material.
00:14:11,00:14:13,And then they have to throw stuff at them
00:14:13,00:14:16,or explode them to see if they can still function
00:14:16,00:14:18,with them exploded.
00:14:18,00:14:20,- I've got a couple land-based bird strikes.
00:14:20,00:14:21,- Okay.
00:14:21,00:14:23,- Non-plane related.
00:14:23,00:14:26,"So do you know the Le Mans, the car race?"
00:14:26,00:14:26,- I do.
00:14:26,00:14:29,The town of Le Mans is twinned with Bolton.
00:14:29,00:14:30,- Is it?
00:14:30,00:14:32,"- Yeah, that's cool."
00:14:32,00:14:35,"So 1953, the winner was a guy called Duncan Hamilton,"
00:14:35,00:14:38,"I believe his name was, and Duncan Hamilton won it"
00:14:38,00:14:40,despite being absolutely pissed off his face.
00:14:40,00:14:44,"He was so drunk, he and his buddy had done a practice circuit"
00:14:44,00:14:47,"before the race, and this is a bit confusing,"
00:14:47,00:14:49,but they had the same plates as another car
00:14:49,00:14:51,"that was on there, which apparently is illegal."
00:14:51,00:14:52,And so they got disqualified from the race.
00:14:52,00:14:54,"So they thought, ""Well, we're on holiday."
00:14:54,00:14:55,"""Let's just go to the bar."""
00:14:55,00:14:56,I got absolutely tanked.
00:14:56,00:15:00,"And then the guy who was the manager of the Jaguar team,"
00:15:00,00:15:03,"who they raced for, called Lofty England."
00:15:03,00:15:03,- Ow.
00:15:03,00:15:05,(all laughing)
00:15:05,00:15:08,- He should be the head of the Brexit party.
00:15:08,00:15:08,(all laughing)
00:15:08,00:15:10,"- He persuaded the organizers to let them both race,"
00:15:10,00:15:12,"but they were completely smashed,"
00:15:12,00:15:13,but they did it anyway.
00:15:13,00:15:14,"And in between the pit stops,"
00:15:14,00:15:17,they were desperately trying to sober up Hamilton with coffee.
00:15:17,00:15:19,So it sort of changed your wheels and give you a drink.
00:15:19,00:15:21,And this is a 24-hour race.
00:15:21,00:15:25,It's one of the most long-hard and enduring races.
00:15:25,00:15:27,"But halfway through the race, or not halfway,"
00:15:27,00:15:30,"but along the race, a bird,"
00:15:30,00:15:32,flew into his face at 130 miles an hour.
00:15:32,00:15:34,(all laughing)
00:15:34,00:15:36,"But they think, 'cause he was so wasted,"
00:15:36,00:15:38,he kind of shrugged off the pain of it
00:15:38,00:15:39,and managed to continue.
00:15:39,00:15:41,"And one, they won the race,"
00:15:41,00:15:42,despite being smashed in the face.
00:15:42,00:15:44,- That would take your face off.
00:15:44,00:15:46,"- I'm not going to ride on the boat, if it was a wreck."
00:15:46,00:15:48,"- Yeah, if it was an albatross."
00:15:48,00:15:50,"- Yeah, it would be incredible."
00:15:50,00:15:51,(all laughing)
00:15:51,00:15:54,"- I mean, there was a thing, Fabio, who is..."
00:15:54,00:15:55,- Fabio.
00:15:55,00:15:56,- Fabio's a male model.
00:15:56,00:15:57,He appears on romance books.
00:15:57,00:16:00,"He was in the, I can't believe it's not Butter ads."
00:16:00,00:16:01,"- It's weird that you expected us to know that,"
00:16:01,00:16:04,"but if I'd have to guess, I would have said he was a male model."
00:16:04,00:16:04,- He's the male model.
00:16:04,00:16:08,"- He was on, I think, something like 200 romance novels."
00:16:08,00:16:11,"- Yeah, he looks like Conan the Barbarian"
00:16:11,00:16:12,"who's got this huge, flowing blood loss."
00:16:12,00:16:14,"- Huge main, the most beautiful..."
00:16:14,00:16:15,"- Guys, guys, calm down."
00:16:15,00:16:16,(all laughing)
00:16:16,00:16:17,You know who you're talking about now?
00:16:17,00:16:18,- He's a guy.
00:16:18,00:16:20,"- Yeah, he was known as the most beautiful man in the world."
00:16:20,00:16:22,"Anyway, he was opening a roller coaster,"
00:16:22,00:16:24,and so he was on the ride.
00:16:24,00:16:27,He was going 73 miles an hour down the first drop
00:16:27,00:16:30,when a 10-pound goose flew into his face.
00:16:30,00:16:33,"- Oh my God, I'd love it if the photo went off just at that moment."
00:16:33,00:16:35,(all laughing)
00:16:35,00:16:38,"- Oh, wow, that, and then there are photos of him."
00:16:38,00:16:39,- Of him.
00:16:39,00:16:40,"- Of him being hit, but of him coming back in,"
00:16:40,00:16:42,just spitting feathers out of his mouth.
00:16:42,00:16:45,"- Yeah, his entire face is bloodied."
00:16:45,00:16:46,- He was on the roller coaster ride
00:16:46,00:16:49,"with a load of sort of models and things like this,"
00:16:49,00:16:52,because it was a big PR launch of the roller coaster.
00:16:52,00:16:52,- Yeah.
00:16:52,00:16:54,- And you just see the carriage coming back in.
00:16:54,00:16:57,"All of the traumatized, he's covered in blood."
00:16:57,00:16:58,"- He's got a broken nose, yeah."
00:16:58,00:17:01,- Do you not think it might have been a jealous fellow model
00:17:01,00:17:03,who's just taken a goose at the roller coaster?
00:17:03,00:17:04,(all laughing)
00:17:04,00:17:06,"- Well, his looks were in forever."
00:17:06,00:17:07,"- No, of course it, you guys."
00:17:07,00:17:08,- Roon Fabius looks.
00:17:08,00:17:09,- That's a beautiful man in the world.
00:17:09,00:17:11,"- They were actually improved, yeah, the goose."
00:17:11,00:17:14,(upbeat music)
00:17:14,00:17:18,"- Okay, it's time for fact number two,"
00:17:18,00:17:19,and that is my fact.
00:17:19,00:17:22,My fact this week is that when nylon stockings
00:17:22,00:17:24,"became rationed during World War II,"
00:17:24,00:17:27,department stores set up leg makeup bars
00:17:27,00:17:29,where women could have stockings
00:17:29,00:17:31,drawn onto their legs instead.
00:17:31,00:17:32,- Very cool.
00:17:32,00:17:34,"- Yeah, they would just go to the shop"
00:17:34,00:17:36,"and they would take hours at a time,"
00:17:36,00:17:39,"and they would draw the hem line at the back of their leg,"
00:17:39,00:17:41,and they would put powders and so on.
00:17:41,00:17:44,- Would they kind of paint the leg
00:17:44,00:17:45,to look a slightly different color
00:17:45,00:17:46,and then draw the line?
00:17:46,00:17:48,"- Yeah, do you put it in like an old cup of tea"
00:17:48,00:17:49,for a little while until it stays?
00:17:49,00:17:50,(all laughing)
00:17:50,00:17:51,- Like the leg.
00:17:51,00:17:52,- The leg is a big cup of tea.
00:17:52,00:17:54,(all laughing)
00:17:54,00:17:55,- That's a nice idea.
00:17:55,00:17:57,You could put everyone in a jacuzzi
00:17:57,00:17:59,just sitting around the edges.
00:17:59,00:17:59,- Yeah.
00:17:59,00:18:00,- And then you could everyone can have a cup
00:18:00,00:18:02,and just take some of the tea.
00:18:02,00:18:03,- That would be lovely.
00:18:03,00:18:06,"- Well, they did use to do it with gravy, I think, didn't they?"
00:18:06,00:18:07,- Right.
00:18:07,00:18:08,"- And with coffee, yeah."
00:18:08,00:18:09,"Because I think, so it's sort of like,"
00:18:09,00:18:11,"women used to just paint the lines up themselves,"
00:18:11,00:18:12,I think. - Yes.
00:18:12,00:18:14,"- Of and no, I didn't realize they had the salon"
00:18:14,00:18:16,specifically to do it for the wealthier.
00:18:16,00:18:18,I suppose you don't get a wobbly line.
00:18:18,00:18:19,"But yeah, if you were doing it at home,"
00:18:19,00:18:22,you'd dip your leg in a sort of vat of gravy
00:18:22,00:18:24,or cocoa powder was another substitute.
00:18:24,00:18:27,"- Amazing, considering a time of extreme rationing"
00:18:27,00:18:29,and deprivation that people just have a vat
00:18:29,00:18:32,of gravy like around solely for their legs.
00:18:32,00:18:33,(all laughing)
00:18:33,00:18:34,"- Well, they had the priority straight."
00:18:34,00:18:36,"- I don't know, in those days,"
00:18:36,00:18:38,"you probably would have to reuse the gravy, no?"
00:18:38,00:18:40,"- I'm sure you would, yeah."
00:18:40,00:18:41,- Yeah.
00:18:41,00:18:41,"- It's such a, I mean, it's just,"
00:18:41,00:18:43,"it's makeup for the legs, isn't it?"
00:18:43,00:18:44,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:18:44,00:18:44,- I'm not strong with that.
00:18:44,00:18:45,"- Nothing wrong with it, no."
00:18:45,00:18:47,- Makeup is just drawing another face on your face.
00:18:47,00:18:49,- So why not draw another leg on your leg?
00:18:49,00:18:50,- Exactly.
00:18:50,00:18:51,(all laughing)
00:18:51,00:18:52,It's brilliant.
00:18:52,00:18:54,It's because people were obsessed with nylon.
00:18:54,00:18:56,"I mean, it was so bizarre that nylon craze,"
00:18:56,00:18:59,"because basically, I think it was invented in about 35"
00:18:59,00:19:02,and it owned or 34 and it only became commercially available
00:19:02,00:19:04,in 37 or 38.
00:19:04,00:19:07,"And by the time the war hit, people were obsessed with it"
00:19:07,00:19:09,to the extent that as soon as it started being rationed
00:19:09,00:19:11,"'cause it was needed for various wartime instruments,"
00:19:11,00:19:13,they went nuts and they were desperate
00:19:13,00:19:14,to show that they still sort of had nylon.
00:19:14,00:19:16,There was this big black market
00:19:16,00:19:18,where nylon went for sort of the equivalent
00:19:18,00:19:21,"of about $500 today, you'd get a pair of nylon tights."
00:19:21,00:19:22,- For just one.
00:19:22,00:19:23,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:19:23,00:19:25,Did they get people like trying to steal your tights off you
00:19:25,00:19:27,"'cause they're so expensive, like an iPhone?"
00:19:27,00:19:29,"- Oh, probably, if it's so hard to steal tights"
00:19:29,00:19:32,"'cause they aren't quite well adhered to the legs, aren't they?"
00:19:32,00:19:33,"- And you could be pulling them, pulling it, turns out."
00:19:33,00:19:35,It's just gravy good things.
00:19:35,00:19:37,(all laughing)
00:19:37,00:19:39,"But I think it's quite harsh 'cause let you say,"
00:19:39,00:19:40,everyone loved them.
00:19:40,00:19:42,It was like the most amazing thing of its day.
00:19:42,00:19:45,"And let you say, everyone got it for a few years"
00:19:45,00:19:47,and then it was taken away 'cause of the war.
00:19:47,00:19:49,"It's like, as if we all had iPhones"
00:19:49,00:19:51,"and then they go after three years,"
00:19:51,00:19:52,you can't have iPhones anymore.
00:19:52,00:19:54,That would be harsh.
00:19:54,00:19:54,- I would.
00:19:54,00:19:56,- The world might be a better place.
00:19:56,00:19:57,(all laughing)
00:19:57,00:19:59,"- The first day of sales, nationally in America,"
00:19:59,00:20:02,"was the 16th of May, 1940."
00:20:02,00:20:03,So the rest of the world was at war.
00:20:03,00:20:05,America hadn't quite decided yet.
00:20:05,00:20:08,"And the statistics vary, but some people say"
00:20:08,00:20:11,that four million pairs were sold in four days.
00:20:11,00:20:13,"That was true, mania."
00:20:13,00:20:16,"But this is a bit like, telly, I think."
00:20:16,00:20:17,Didn't Britain just get TV?
00:20:17,00:20:19,"And then the war happened and they said,"
00:20:19,00:20:22,"well, we're not gonna do TV anymore for the next six years."
00:20:22,00:20:25,And then it started again in the late '40s or early '50s.
00:20:25,00:20:27,"There's a lot of those inventions which have been existing,"
00:20:27,00:20:29,but it was just back burner for the war.
00:20:29,00:20:31,"- And then post war, when they were available again,"
00:20:31,00:20:33,there were nylon riots.
00:20:33,00:20:35,"It was, 'cause they didn't have enough stock"
00:20:35,00:20:36,for the amount of people who wanted
00:20:36,00:20:37,"and were obsessed with them,"
00:20:37,00:20:39,and been waiting for them to come back.
00:20:39,00:20:43,"So in Pittsburgh, they had 40,000 people lining up"
00:20:43,00:20:47,"over a mile, even though there was only 13,000 pairs available."
00:20:47,00:20:50,So you can imagine the chaos when those shops opened the doors.
00:20:50,00:20:51,"- Yeah, there used to be, you know,"
00:20:51,00:20:54,"police would have to be deployed quite a lot, I think."
00:20:54,00:20:56,This was sort of '45 and '46.
00:20:56,00:20:59,"There was, I think, do pont the main company"
00:20:59,00:21:01,that made the tights or the stockings.
00:21:01,00:21:03,They said they would make 360 million pairs
00:21:03,00:21:05,as soon as the war ended within a year.
00:21:05,00:21:07,And they could not live up to that at all.
00:21:07,00:21:09,"People went nuts, got really excited."
00:21:09,00:21:11,"So there was, yeah, there's 16 block queue"
00:21:11,00:21:12,where people started fighting.
00:21:12,00:21:14,"In Georgia, there were fist fights"
00:21:14,00:21:16,and police had to be called to break them up.
00:21:16,00:21:20,"There was a mob in Chicago of 1,200 women"
00:21:20,00:21:21,who were outside a dress shop
00:21:21,00:21:22,just bashing on the windows again.
00:21:22,00:21:24,Police had to be called.
00:21:24,00:21:25,They went mad.
00:21:25,00:21:26,They went hysterical.
00:21:26,00:21:28,"I don't want to, you know, be stereotyping here,"
00:21:28,00:21:30,"but they lost their shit, though."
00:21:30,00:21:32,(laughing)
00:21:32,00:21:34,"- People were scared of nylon,"
00:21:34,00:21:36,because partly because it had this weird process
00:21:36,00:21:39,"by which it was made, it was sort of acid and stuff."
00:21:39,00:21:41,And partly because there was just this huge Ferrari
00:21:41,00:21:42,"about it, so there's a backlash."
00:21:42,00:21:45,"And all these rumors went around about what it could do,"
00:21:45,00:21:47,so people thought it would give you cancer of the legs.
00:21:47,00:21:50,They thought it mounted in hot water.
00:21:50,00:21:52,"I don't know why it'd go in hot water wearing tights,"
00:21:52,00:21:54,but it was that.
00:21:54,00:21:56,They feel like snakes when wet.
00:21:56,00:21:57,(laughing)
00:21:57,00:21:59,- The same thing reported.
00:21:59,00:22:01,People thought they were made from corpses
00:22:01,00:22:02,"because there was a thing called cadaverine,"
00:22:02,00:22:04,which was gathered from course up
00:22:04,00:22:06,"and it's gathered from corpses to make stuff,"
00:22:06,00:22:06,but they weren't.
00:22:06,00:22:08,It was a rumor.
00:22:08,00:22:09,"- Wait, so cadaverine didn't exist?"
00:22:09,00:22:11,"- I think cadaverine, I think it did exist."
00:22:11,00:22:14,It was a chemical that you could get from rotting cadavers
00:22:14,00:22:15,that comes from rotting cadavers.
00:22:15,00:22:16,- I think that's the word that people used
00:22:16,00:22:19,"for just like human snarge, basically."
00:22:19,00:22:20,"- Human snarge, right."
00:22:20,00:22:23,- The thing is with this is it was a very smelly process.
00:22:23,00:22:25,"Like the industrial process was really smelly,"
00:22:25,00:22:27,"so when journalists went there,"
00:22:27,00:22:28,they smelled how bad it was.
00:22:28,00:22:31,And I think actually one newspaper did say
00:22:31,00:22:33,that this happened in a newspaper article
00:22:33,00:22:35,and everyone believed it when obviously it wasn't true.
00:22:35,00:22:36,"- Oh, yeah."
00:22:36,00:22:38,- That's great.
00:22:38,00:22:40,"- And there was, I think there was one other report"
00:22:40,00:22:43,in a paper of a woman who was standing at a bus stop
00:22:43,00:22:46,and the bus went past and the exhaust fumes
00:22:46,00:22:49,of the bus stripped the nylon off her legs completely.
00:22:49,00:22:51,I know all these rumors that the nylon would just fall
00:22:51,00:22:52,off your legs.
00:22:52,00:22:53,- It's like a belly hilt.
00:22:53,00:22:57,"- I think with people thought they might burn,"
00:22:57,00:22:58,did you say?
00:22:58,00:22:59,"- Yeah, melt."
00:22:59,00:23:01,- I think so because you've got this basically a plastic
00:23:01,00:23:02,as it is polymer.
00:23:02,00:23:03,- Yeah.
00:23:03,00:23:05,- So it makes sense that it would just melt on to you.
00:23:05,00:23:06,- It actually could a bit.
00:23:06,00:23:08,"If it was too humid, the air would too damp,"
00:23:08,00:23:10,then it could start melting down your legs.
00:23:10,00:23:11,- Really?
00:23:11,00:23:16,"- There is a problem with nylon and health today,"
00:23:16,00:23:17,which is nylon teabags.
00:23:17,00:23:20,So they started coming in about 12 or 13 years ago
00:23:20,00:23:22,"and I've found articles from a time saying,"
00:23:22,00:23:24,"hey, great new nylon teabags,"
00:23:24,00:23:25,number of these boring paper teabags.
00:23:25,00:23:28,"And you know, they're silky and they feel nice"
00:23:28,00:23:32,"and it turns out they're plastic, obviously."
00:23:32,00:23:32,- Plastic's bad for you.
00:23:32,00:23:33,- Plastic's bad.
00:23:33,00:23:36,So is that the most of the ones that I would get down
00:23:36,00:23:37,the shop so they like that?
00:23:37,00:23:38,- You are not real.
00:23:38,00:23:43,"- So a normal packet of a normal packet of teabaget,"
00:23:43,00:23:46,I think those are all paper except sometimes they're sealed
00:23:46,00:23:48,"with a tiny, tiny blob of granite."
00:23:48,00:23:50,But the some coffee shops sell them in
00:23:50,00:23:52,and they look kind of weird and different.
00:23:52,00:23:53,- You mean the posh ones?
00:23:53,00:23:53,- The posh ones?
00:23:53,00:23:54,- The posh ones.
00:23:54,00:23:55,- Yeah.
00:23:55,00:23:56,- There's posh and it feels like a bit like silk.
00:23:56,00:23:57,"- Well, really posh ones are made of silk."
00:23:57,00:23:59,(laughing)
00:23:59,00:24:00,- Wow.
00:24:00,00:24:03,"- But if you don't, if you can't run to these patee,"
00:24:03,00:24:04,if you can't run to a silk.
00:24:04,00:24:06,"- Back, someone will fobby off with a nylon one"
00:24:06,00:24:07,and they've been studied.
00:24:07,00:24:10,So every single silky plasticity teabag
00:24:10,00:24:13,releases 11.6 billion microplastics.
00:24:13,00:24:14,"These are very, very, very small."
00:24:14,00:24:15,- Jesus.
00:24:15,00:24:18,- And three billion nano plastics.
00:24:18,00:24:20,"And those are extremely tiny, they're smaller."
00:24:20,00:24:23,"Yeah, but they are, they are bad."
00:24:23,00:24:26,"So the scientists tried feeding them to water fleas,"
00:24:26,00:24:29,which are little tiny lobster animals
00:24:29,00:24:31,and they became very stressed
00:24:31,00:24:34,and the exoskeleton swelled up.
00:24:34,00:24:35,So it wasn't good for them.
00:24:35,00:24:36,"- So, yeah."
00:24:36,00:24:37,- But it means that what you're saying is
00:24:37,00:24:41,"in your cup of tea of posh, but not that posh tea,"
00:24:41,00:24:43,then you're getting it into your body.
00:24:43,00:24:45,"And basically, I mean, they're gonna find this"
00:24:45,00:24:46,in years to come out.
00:24:46,00:24:48,"It's gonna be, you know, when the Romans"
00:24:48,00:24:52,"had lead in the pipes, and they all went crazy."
00:24:52,00:24:54,And everyone knew it was 'cause of the lead in the pipes.
00:24:54,00:24:57,"That's what it's gonna be, we're just eating plastic all the time."
00:24:57,00:25:00,"- On the bristles on toothbrushes, plastic is,"
00:25:00,00:25:02,"I mean, they're nylon as well."
00:25:02,00:25:04,- Do you think this is gonna be the explanation
00:25:04,00:25:06,of the person of Brexit and Donald Trump and all of that?
00:25:06,00:25:08,"It's actually just, like, you know how we've discovered"
00:25:08,00:25:10,"the Salem Witch Crisis was,"
00:25:10,00:25:12,people say it's caused by the ergo from the dodgy bread.
00:25:12,00:25:16,It's gonna be that we were just eating microplastics.
00:25:16,00:25:17,- That's it.
00:25:17,00:25:20,"- Okay, I'm so glad about that because I hate those tea bags."
00:25:20,00:25:21,They make awful tea.
00:25:21,00:25:23,- I don't think they're very permeable.
00:25:23,00:25:24,- They're not permeable enough.
00:25:24,00:25:25,That's exactly correct.
00:25:25,00:25:27,"So the pretentious places serve them,"
00:25:27,00:25:28,and you don't even taste any tea.
00:25:28,00:25:30,"- I read an article that said that they're,"
00:25:30,00:25:32,"when they were trying to come up with the name for nylon,"
00:25:32,00:25:36,there were over 400 options for what they wanted to go for.
00:25:36,00:25:38,"Yeah, and there's a few that we know of."
00:25:38,00:25:43,"So one was CLIS, K-L-I-S, which is silk backwards,"
00:25:43,00:25:44,"because this was, yeah, an awkward product."
00:25:44,00:25:45,"- It was like, instead of silk,"
00:25:45,00:25:47,"crossing it, that's why it was so big."
00:25:47,00:25:49,"- Exactly, yeah, this was like the cheap replacement,"
00:25:49,00:25:50,the affordable replacement.
00:25:50,00:25:54,"Neuron was one, which is actually no run."
00:25:54,00:25:57,"- No run. - 'Cause the tights, so run."
00:25:57,00:25:59,And then there was Duporor.
00:25:59,00:26:03,"And it's a shame it wasn't called that, Duporor."
00:26:03,00:26:05,D-U-P-A-R-W-H.
00:26:05,00:26:06,"- I think it's more like Duporoo, you know."
00:26:06,00:26:08,"- Oh, Duporoo. - Yeah."
00:26:08,00:26:09,"- Duporoo, like Winnie the Pooh, Duporoo."
00:26:09,00:26:10,"- Okay, cool."
00:26:10,00:26:11,"Yeah, sorry."
00:26:11,00:26:12,"- Duporoo. - Duporoo, super Duporoo."
00:26:12,00:26:13,- Super Duporoo. - Yeah.
00:26:13,00:26:15,"- Okay, so that was an acronym."
00:26:15,00:26:18,"It stood for Dupont, pulls a rabbit out of a hat."
00:26:18,00:26:19,- Yes.
00:26:19,00:26:20,- And Dupont was the manufacturer.
00:26:20,00:26:21,"- Yeah. - Right, yeah, yeah."
00:26:21,00:26:25,- We should say why they banded.
00:26:25,00:26:28,"'Cause the reason, the reason it was so amazing"
00:26:28,00:26:31,was that it was another material
00:26:31,00:26:33,"which replaced silk, basically."
00:26:33,00:26:35,"And before the war, America imported,"
00:26:35,00:26:38,I think it was 80% of all the silk made in the world
00:26:38,00:26:41,"was imported, and 90% of that was from Japan."
00:26:41,00:26:43,"So obviously, when the USA and Japan were a war,"
00:26:43,00:26:44,big problem.
00:26:44,00:26:47,"And nylon was this incredible wonder substance,"
00:26:47,00:26:50,"which really contributed to the USA winning the war,"
00:26:50,00:26:53,because it made better parachutes than silk parachutes.
00:26:53,00:26:55,"Silk parachutes got moldy, the heart of fold."
00:26:55,00:26:59,"Nylons went better, and it was used for ropes and fuel tanks"
00:26:59,00:27:01,and shoelaces and mosquito nets and hammers.
00:27:01,00:27:03,Just anything you could think of in the field
00:27:03,00:27:05,that was fabriky.
00:27:05,00:27:07,"Nylon was the thing, you know."
00:27:07,00:27:09,"- Yeah, when we were told to hand in their tights,"
00:27:09,00:27:10,weren't they?
00:27:10,00:27:12,It was sort of a patriotic war effort.
00:27:12,00:27:15,"- Can you turn tights back into, let's say a fuel tank?"
00:27:15,00:27:16,"- Yeah, I believe they could,"
00:27:16,00:27:19,because they weren't asked to do an amnesty.
00:27:19,00:27:22,And I think that one of the slogans was a Boeing super fortress
00:27:22,00:27:26,"that lands on enough nylon to make 4,000 pairs of stockings."
00:27:26,00:27:27,So that's that it made the tires.
00:27:27,00:27:30,"But they did ask people to hand in their stockings, so."
00:27:30,00:27:32,- I think you could turn it into a rope quite easily.
00:27:32,00:27:33,"- Yeah, try it."
00:27:33,00:27:35,Or if you're in the USA as you could pull it over your head
00:27:35,00:27:36,for the disguise.
00:27:36,00:27:37,"- Yeah, that's good."
00:27:37,00:27:38,- That's good.
00:27:38,00:27:40,- Cut a pair of my hulls.
00:27:40,00:27:41,- Yeah.
00:27:41,00:27:44,"- Or if you're marching into Paris, saving Paris,"
00:27:44,00:27:46,you could go into skies in the Mulan Rouge.
00:27:46,00:27:47,(laughing)
00:27:47,00:27:49,- A lot of callbacks to the free of your service.
00:27:49,00:27:53,- It's obvious as if I literally just edited it.
00:27:53,00:27:55,- James is trying to turn this into a long-running storyline.
00:27:55,00:27:56,A lot of five years.
00:27:56,00:27:59,"We need some cut lines, imagine."
00:27:59,00:28:00,- We need a narrative.
00:28:00,00:28:01,- Yeah.
00:28:01,00:28:03,(upbeat music)
00:28:03,00:28:09,"- Okay, it is time for fact number three."
00:28:09,00:28:11,And that is Chisinski.
00:28:11,00:28:15,- My fact this week is that more than 80% of Japan's temples
00:28:15,00:28:17,have suffered from raccoon damage.
00:28:18,00:28:21,And it's really sad because raccoons are not even native
00:28:21,00:28:23,"to Japan, obviously, but they've swarmed there"
00:28:23,00:28:24,the last few years.
00:28:24,00:28:27,And they're one of the main causes of damage to the temples.
00:28:27,00:28:29,So the advice to anyone out there
00:28:29,00:28:32,who's thinking about getting a raccoon for a pet is don't.
00:28:32,00:28:35,They will eat anything and they cause damage
00:28:35,00:28:36,to anywhere they are.
00:28:36,00:28:39,"So in Japan, they've just climbed all around the temples"
00:28:39,00:28:42,and they wanna find a nice little cozy nook to sleep in.
00:28:42,00:28:45,And they'll tear and eat and scratch through anything
00:28:45,00:28:46,that stands in their way.
00:28:46,00:28:48,- Is it because people have got them as pets
00:28:48,00:28:50,and then let them go or?
00:28:50,00:28:51,- It is indeed.
00:28:51,00:28:55,"So it's this weird story where there was a very, very popular show"
00:28:55,00:29:00,"in the '70s, in 1977 called ""Rascal the Racoon."""
00:29:00,00:29:03,"And it was an animation, it was like an anime thing."
00:29:03,00:29:05,"And people thought, ""Oh, I wanna get a pet raccoon."""
00:29:05,00:29:08,They obviously got the pets before they watched the end
00:29:08,00:29:10,'cause the moral of the show and the book it's based on
00:29:10,00:29:12,is that raccoons are terrible pets.
00:29:12,00:29:14,You can't take care of them.
00:29:14,00:29:16,"And at the end, they had to release it back into the wild."
00:29:16,00:29:17,"Anyway, people bought all these."
00:29:17,00:29:19,"I think people were buying like 2000,"
00:29:19,00:29:21,a year of being imported into Japan.
00:29:21,00:29:23,And then they started eating people's houses.
00:29:23,00:29:24,And so they released them.
00:29:24,00:29:26,"- And they banned the imports, didn't they?"
00:29:26,00:29:27,"- Yeah, yeah, you can't do that."
00:29:27,00:29:28,- I read one source that said
00:29:28,00:29:32,"they were importing 1,500 a month."
00:29:32,00:29:33,- Wow. - Wow.
00:29:33,00:29:33,- Jesus.
00:29:33,00:29:34,- Jesus. - It would be amazing.
00:29:34,00:29:36,- There's too many raccoons.
00:29:36,00:29:36,- It's too many.
00:29:36,00:29:39,"I mean, if you're a country which doesn't have any raccoons,"
00:29:39,00:29:40,then one is too many.
00:29:40,00:29:41,"- You're right, you're absolutely right."
00:29:41,00:29:45,- And the author of this book is Sterling North.
00:29:45,00:29:47,"Great name, Sterling North."
00:29:47,00:29:48,It's like lofty England.
00:29:48,00:29:53,He passed away a few years before this animation hit Japan.
00:29:53,00:29:57,So he never got to see the true sort of success
00:29:57,00:30:00,"of his, he populated a country with an animal, basically."
00:30:00,00:30:02,"- Yeah, but we're saying it's not really a success."
00:30:02,00:30:03,It's not a success story.
00:30:03,00:30:05,- It is if you're a raccoon.
00:30:05,00:30:06,And you want to travel.
00:30:06,00:30:08,- It's a huge win for raccoons.
00:30:08,00:30:10,And we know that Sterling North was interested
00:30:10,00:30:11,in raccoons success.
00:30:11,00:30:15,"- Yeah, we don't know what you felt about Japan doing."
00:30:15,00:30:16,- No.
00:30:16,00:30:20,- Because America's the only place where they're native.
00:30:20,00:30:22,But they've sort of invaded Germany as well now
00:30:22,00:30:23,in Europe.
00:30:23,00:30:25,"- They haven't invaded, it's not like."
00:30:25,00:30:26,- Yeah.
00:30:26,00:30:27,"- Well, I don't know because the European press"
00:30:27,00:30:29,called them Nazi raccoons.
00:30:29,00:30:30,- Did they?
00:30:30,00:30:31,- Yeah.
00:30:31,00:30:34,"If you look at any article in the last 10, 15 years"
00:30:34,00:30:37,"from some of the more salacious press, I must say,"
00:30:37,00:30:40,"they'll say, ""Nazi raccoons coming to the Netherlands"
00:30:40,00:30:43,"on Nazi raccoons coming to France or something."""
00:30:43,00:30:45,And that's because there was a theory
00:30:45,00:30:47,that the first ones were let into the wild
00:30:47,00:30:49,by Herman Goering.
00:30:49,00:30:52,This is a massive rumor.
00:30:52,00:30:54,And apparently he didn't do it.
00:30:54,00:30:58,They were let into the wild in Germany in 1934
00:30:58,00:31:00,to promote diversity of fauna.
00:31:00,00:31:02,But Goering had nothing to do with it.
00:31:02,00:31:04,But the rumor has persisted.
00:31:04,00:31:06,And so we get all these articles saying Nazi raccoons.
00:31:06,00:31:09,"- Well, at least we stand that rumor out today."
00:31:09,00:31:12,(all laughing)
00:31:12,00:31:16,"- In America, I don't know if they were kept as pets"
00:31:16,00:31:18,because I guess they should be in the wild
00:31:18,00:31:19,hence the moral of the book.
00:31:19,00:31:21,But one person who did keep of raccoon as a pet
00:31:21,00:31:23,was the president of the United States
00:31:23,00:31:25,"in the White House, Calvin College."
00:31:25,00:31:26,- Good day.
00:31:26,00:31:28,"- Yeah, he had a raccoon called Rebecca."
00:31:28,00:31:30,And Rebecca was meant to be eaten
00:31:30,00:31:32,as part of a Thanksgiving dinner.
00:31:32,00:31:35,But he kind of just took to Rebecca instead.
00:31:35,00:31:37,- Did they used to eat that instead of turkey?
00:31:37,00:31:38,- Apparently.
00:31:38,00:31:39,- Did they?
00:31:39,00:31:40,"- Well, they didn't."
00:31:40,00:31:41,"It came from, was it Mississippi?"
00:31:41,00:31:43,- I think sent him the raccoon.
00:31:43,00:31:46,"And I think Calvin looked at it and when,"
00:31:46,00:31:48,"and someone said, it is edible mate."
00:31:48,00:31:49,"And he said, it's not edible to me."
00:31:49,00:31:51,Take that away from you.
00:31:51,00:31:54,"'Cause you know, it was claimed he was doing the decent thing."
00:31:54,00:31:55,"And yeah, then they sort of laughed at it, didn't they?"
00:31:55,00:31:58,"- Yeah, proper pet, like she had an engraved collar"
00:31:58,00:31:59,that she got for Christmas.
00:31:59,00:32:01,"Yeah, she was a good pet."
00:32:01,00:32:03,- Did you read that Christmas when they gave her
00:32:03,00:32:07,"the engraved collar, the present that they got their son"
00:32:07,00:32:09,was a coat made of raccoon fur?
00:32:09,00:32:11,(all laughing)
00:32:11,00:32:13,- That's a good warning to Rebecca to behave.
00:32:13,00:32:15,"- It's very good, isn't it?"
00:32:15,00:32:16,- But the collar from the raccoon was made
00:32:16,00:32:18,from the rest bow and of that child.
00:32:18,00:32:20,(all laughing)
00:32:20,00:32:25,- They are really clever.
00:32:25,00:32:26,That's the amazing thing.
00:32:26,00:32:28,"And I read an article saying that they,"
00:32:28,00:32:29,"in the early 20th century,"
00:32:29,00:32:31,were used in a lot of lab experiments.
00:32:31,00:32:34,"And that they could have been lab rats, basically."
00:32:34,00:32:36,Or they could have been the go-to for experimentation.
00:32:36,00:32:38,"But basically, they're too good."
00:32:38,00:32:39,They're too clever.
00:32:39,00:32:41,"They escape, they chew through things."
00:32:41,00:32:43,- They start performing experiments on us.
00:32:43,00:32:44,(all laughing)
00:32:44,00:32:46,"- They get into the events and then,"
00:32:46,00:32:48,and just they were a nightmare.
00:32:48,00:32:51,And it turns out that rats are a bit easier to control.
00:32:51,00:32:53,- Yeah. - Yeah.
00:32:53,00:32:54,"- They're not hanging out with humans, don't they?"
00:32:54,00:32:57,They're one of the species that has really thrived
00:32:57,00:33:00,"from human, you know, building up urban environments."
00:33:00,00:33:01,They work very well in cities.
00:33:01,00:33:04,"- They're like the American version of a fox,"
00:33:04,00:33:05,like an urban fox.
00:33:05,00:33:06,"- I think they are, I think they're sort of like a better"
00:33:06,00:33:08,"version, like a grade up from foxes."
00:33:08,00:33:12,"- They've got bloody hands, although not opposable thumbs."
00:33:12,00:33:16,"The only thing we've got over them, one thing,"
00:33:16,00:33:17,is opposable thumbs.
00:33:17,00:33:19,And this has actually proved quite crucial in the US.
00:33:19,00:33:21,"Well, I'm sure there are lots of listeners"
00:33:21,00:33:23,who have issues with raccoons breaking into your bins.
00:33:23,00:33:26,And so they're like constantly trying to upgrade bins
00:33:26,00:33:28,to make them inaccessible to raccoons.
00:33:28,00:33:29,"But because they're so smart,"
00:33:29,00:33:32,they keep on working out how to do it.
00:33:32,00:33:34,"And then they have made one apparently,"
00:33:34,00:33:35,which is clocked onto the fact
00:33:35,00:33:36,they don't have an opposable thumb.
00:33:36,00:33:38,So if you can do that.
00:33:38,00:33:39,- Is that in Toronto?
00:33:39,00:33:40,"- I think it might be, yeah."
00:33:40,00:33:44,- Because Toronto spent $31 million
00:33:44,00:33:47,getting a good raccoon proof bin in 2015.
00:33:47,00:33:49,They were so frustrated and they were really hard.
00:33:49,00:33:53,"And the city's mayor wrote, ""We are ready, we are armed"
00:33:53,00:33:55,"""and we are motivated to show that we cannot be defeated"
00:33:55,00:33:56,"""by these critters."""
00:33:56,00:33:57,(laughing)
00:33:57,00:33:59,"As they were being rolled out across the city,"
00:33:59,00:34:02,"he tweeted, ""I love the smell of new raccoon-resistant"
00:34:02,00:34:03,"""green bins in the morning."""
00:34:03,00:34:07,"And within a few days, raccoons had managed"
00:34:07,00:34:09,to make their way into a few of these samples.
00:34:09,00:34:10,- And beaten him.
00:34:10,00:34:13,(laughing)
00:34:13,00:34:14,"- There's actually an argument, I think,"
00:34:14,00:34:17,that it's quite bad that we keep on trying to upgrade
00:34:17,00:34:19,these bins because we're just making them cleverer now.
00:34:19,00:34:21,We're in this terrible arms race with raccoons
00:34:21,00:34:24,"where the more we complexify the bins,"
00:34:24,00:34:25,the better they're getting--
00:34:25,00:34:26,"- I know what you're saying,"
00:34:26,00:34:28,but then actually we're getting better as well.
00:34:28,00:34:30,"So actually by them forcing us to get better,"
00:34:30,00:34:32,we're getting smarter.
00:34:32,00:34:33,The raccoons are getting smarter.
00:34:33,00:34:35,It's the rest of the animal kingdoms that are losing it.
00:34:35,00:34:37,(laughing)
00:34:37,00:34:38,Eventually it'll just be a massive battle
00:34:38,00:34:41,between us and the raccoons with raccoons on it.
00:34:41,00:34:43,(laughing)
00:34:43,00:34:46,You were saying about how lots of towns really don't like them.
00:34:46,00:34:47,"There's an online factoid that says,"
00:34:47,00:34:50,"""If you take a raccoon head to the town hall"
00:34:50,00:34:53,"""of a town called Hanukkah, they'll give you $10."""
00:34:53,00:34:55,And it says that all over the internet.
00:34:55,00:34:55,- Yeah.
00:34:55,00:34:57,"- But when I read it, I emailed them,"
00:34:57,00:34:59,"and they said, ""No, this is absolute rubbish."""
00:34:59,00:35:01,(laughing)
00:35:01,00:35:02,"So if you do have a raccoon head,"
00:35:02,00:35:04,don't bother taking it to the town hall of Hanukkah.
00:35:04,00:35:05,- That's good.
00:35:05,00:35:06,I think we're doing a real public service.
00:35:06,00:35:09,We've prevented people from decapitating raccoons.
00:35:09,00:35:11,"- Although, actually, with the battle that's coming up,"
00:35:11,00:35:13,we need to decapitate as much as possible.
00:35:13,00:35:14,(laughing)
00:35:14,00:35:15,That's so right.
00:35:15,00:35:18,(upbeat music)
00:35:18,00:35:20,"- Okay, it's time for our final fact of the show,"
00:35:20,00:35:22,and that is Andy.
00:35:22,00:35:25,"- My fact is that the economist, John Maynard Keens,"
00:35:25,00:35:28,"once bought a priceless sizzan painting,"
00:35:28,00:35:30,and then hid it in a hedge.
00:35:30,00:35:31,(laughing)
00:35:31,00:35:32,- Very good.
00:35:32,00:35:33,- Yeah.
00:35:33,00:35:35,- Why did he hide it?
00:35:35,00:35:38,"- Well, it was a hedge fund, wasn't it?"
00:35:38,00:35:39,- Brilliant.
00:35:39,00:35:40,- You see.
00:35:40,00:35:41,"- He sees an economist, you see."
00:35:41,00:35:43,- The end of that section.
00:35:43,00:35:44,(laughing)
00:35:44,00:35:46,- So this is a fact from a podcast
00:35:46,00:35:48,"that's coming out very shortly, actually,"
00:35:48,00:35:50,"and it's by friend of the show,"
00:35:50,00:35:52,"or a few of us know him, Tim Halford,"
00:35:52,00:35:54,"who is the undercover economist,"
00:35:54,00:35:56,"and his new show is called ""Cautionary Tales,"""
00:35:56,00:36:00,"and it's all about sort of mishaps, basically."
00:36:00,00:36:02,"Things that haven't gone to plan, fiasco's,"
00:36:02,00:36:05,"grade A mishaps, you know, this kind of stuff."
00:36:05,00:36:09,"Oil tankers crashing, and I've seen a bit of it,"
00:36:09,00:36:11,and it's gonna be an extremely good show.
00:36:11,00:36:12,"- Oh, it sounds amazing."
00:36:12,00:36:14,"I mean, it sounds like we're gonna be stealing a lot from it."
00:36:14,00:36:15,"I mean, look at it, it hasn't even come out."
00:36:15,00:36:16,We're ready stealing from it.
00:36:16,00:36:17,- Borrowing.
00:36:17,00:36:19,"- Borrowing, sorry, legally borrowing."
00:36:19,00:36:21,- Are we giving this fact back?
00:36:21,00:36:22,At the end?
00:36:22,00:36:23,(laughing)
00:36:23,00:36:24,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:36:24,00:36:26,"So anyway, Tim sent me this fact,"
00:36:26,00:36:29,and it's about Keens or Keens.
00:36:29,00:36:30,- Keens to the right.
00:36:30,00:36:31,"- There are people say Keens, but I've read Keens online,"
00:36:31,00:36:34,"so I've read Keens, but I think we should say Keens."
00:36:34,00:36:35,- All right.
00:36:35,00:36:36,"- For the wise, no one's gonna know who would take it."
00:36:36,00:36:37,(laughing)
00:36:37,00:36:40,"- And it was in 1918, the first world war was grinding on."
00:36:40,00:36:42,"He was a bright young economist,"
00:36:42,00:36:46,"and he realized that France's economy was very weak too,"
00:36:46,00:36:48,and Britain was going to need to collect
00:36:48,00:36:50,a massive amount of loan money.
00:36:50,00:36:53,And he wanted to buy up artistic masterpieces
00:36:53,00:36:56,"on behalf of Britain, so then the British government"
00:36:56,00:36:59,wouldn't need to collect quite as much loan money.
00:36:59,00:37:01,"Britain would have a lot of new artworks, got it."
00:37:01,00:37:04,"And also, he felt a bit embarrassed about working"
00:37:04,00:37:05,"for the war effort, 'cause he was quite a Bohemian,"
00:37:05,00:37:07,"he was quite a pacifist, and a lot of his friends"
00:37:07,00:37:10,had kind of ditched him over his stance in the war.
00:37:10,00:37:11,- Oh.
00:37:11,00:37:14,"- So, he got Charles Holmes, who was the director"
00:37:14,00:37:16,"of the National Gallery on-side,"
00:37:16,00:37:17,and he found a huge art auction
00:37:17,00:37:21,"that was happening in Paris, all of Degas' collection"
00:37:21,00:37:23,"was being sold, and they went to the auction."
00:37:23,00:37:25,"Holmes had shaved his moustache,"
00:37:25,00:37:26,so he wouldn't be recognized
00:37:26,00:37:29,as the director of the National Gallery just in case.
00:37:29,00:37:30,"And the auction was really quiet,"
00:37:30,00:37:32,'cause Paris was in the middle of being bombed
00:37:32,00:37:34,"by Germany at the time of the auction,"
00:37:34,00:37:36,so not many people turned up.
00:37:36,00:37:40,"And Holmes bought over 20 masterwork paintings,"
00:37:40,00:37:42,"and they had a sort of blank check from the government,"
00:37:42,00:37:44,"they had 20,000 pounds, which is a huge amount,"
00:37:44,00:37:47,"and Keynes bought himself a seazan,"
00:37:47,00:37:49,"and they traveled back to England,"
00:37:49,00:37:50,"he'd been traveling for 24 hours,"
00:37:50,00:37:53,"and he was visiting his friends in their countryside home,"
00:37:53,00:37:55,and he was so knackered that he'd just chuck the suitcase
00:37:55,00:37:58,"in the hedge with his priceless seazan painting in it,"
00:37:58,00:38:00,"and he walked into the house and he said,"
00:38:00,00:38:02,"""There's a seazan in the hedge outside, if you wanna go and look."""
00:38:02,00:38:04,"- So I've been to this house, have you?"
00:38:04,00:38:09,"- Yeah, it's called Charleston, and it's in Sussex."
00:38:09,00:38:10,It's very near my in-laws.
00:38:10,00:38:11,I went to it recently.
00:38:11,00:38:12,It was part of the Bloomsbury group house.
00:38:12,00:38:16,It's so Virginia Woolf's sister is who lived there
00:38:16,00:38:20,with her artistic friend/lover and his lover.
00:38:20,00:38:21,It was a complicated situation.
00:38:21,00:38:23,"And the house is amazing, it's full of incredible art,"
00:38:23,00:38:27,"like Walter Sickert's original stuff,"
00:38:27,00:38:30,"which I studied because if you remember,"
00:38:30,00:38:32,"there was a theory that he was Jack the Ripper,"
00:38:32,00:38:34,according to Patricia Cornwall.
00:38:34,00:38:36,So I was looking close for clues.
00:38:36,00:38:38,"- No, it's just normal paintings."
00:38:38,00:38:39,- Probably 'cause it's bullshit.
00:38:39,00:38:41,"- Probably 'cause there's no tree through it,"
00:38:41,00:38:44,"didn't write ""I did it"" in any of the corners of the pictures."
00:38:44,00:38:47,"- But no, yeah, so it's an amazing house."
00:38:47,00:38:48,I've probably passed the hedge.
00:38:48,00:38:49,- So cool.
00:38:49,00:38:52,- I'm still a bit confused about why he didn't just bring
00:38:52,00:38:54,the suitcase into the house and ask if he could leave it
00:38:54,00:38:56,in the entrance or something.
00:38:56,00:38:57,"- Whenever you come back from holiday,"
00:38:57,00:38:59,"I got all the way to your front door,"
00:38:59,00:39:00,"I got, you know what, I can't be bothered"
00:39:00,00:39:02,"bringing the bag-based locks back,"
00:39:02,00:39:04,I'm just gonna throw it in the hedge.
00:39:04,00:39:06,- It feels like there's something missing from the account
00:39:06,00:39:08,'cause it's all from him writing it in from his friends.
00:39:08,00:39:10,"I think maybe part, it might have been"
00:39:10,00:39:12,'cause he wanted to make an entrance
00:39:12,00:39:13,"and say, ""Hey, it's me."""
00:39:13,00:39:16,And I've got a price this bit of art in the hedge.
00:39:16,00:39:17,It's not clear.
00:39:17,00:39:18,- You don't just all everyone in the house
00:39:18,00:39:20,"would go, ""Why have you been in the hedge, mate?"""
00:39:20,00:39:21,- Yeah.
00:39:21,00:39:22,- And they were in the hedge.
00:39:22,00:39:23,- They rushed out.
00:39:23,00:39:23,- I bet they did.
00:39:23,00:39:24,- Of course it was.
00:39:24,00:39:25,- But he did.
00:39:25,00:39:26,- 'Cause they wanted to see it
00:39:26,00:39:28,and they gathered around it by moonlight.
00:39:28,00:39:29,"And it was, it was quite nice."
00:39:29,00:39:31,The reason he had bought it was because
00:39:31,00:39:34,the National Gallery director had refused
00:39:34,00:39:37,"'cause it was Sizzan, who I think was a post-impressionist,"
00:39:37,00:39:39,and it was very avant-garde.
00:39:39,00:39:41,And it was too avant-garde
00:39:41,00:39:42,for the National Gallery to be buying.
00:39:42,00:39:44,"And home, so I'm not gonna waste my money on this."
00:39:44,00:39:46,It's too edgy.
00:39:46,00:39:49,"And Keens was a bit more out there and he said,"
00:39:49,00:39:50,"""I'll buy it."""
00:39:50,00:39:51,"- Well, yeah."
00:39:51,00:39:54,"- He was out there for normal society,"
00:39:54,00:39:56,but then he feels like he was the straight lace one
00:39:56,00:39:59,"of the Bloom's preset, like he was bridging a gap."
00:39:59,00:40:01,"I think, 'cause he, but I don't know,"
00:40:01,00:40:04,he had such a central role in that set of people
00:40:04,00:40:05,"who were just artists and creatives,"
00:40:05,00:40:07,which you don't picture Keens being.
00:40:07,00:40:10,And so he was there with Wolf and Sack of the West
00:40:10,00:40:12,and Ian Forster.
00:40:12,00:40:14,And one thing that they were all very relaxed about
00:40:14,00:40:16,and I find this really interesting
00:40:16,00:40:17,that society was really relaxed about
00:40:17,00:40:19,was the fact that he was bisexual
00:40:19,00:40:21,"and for the first years of his sexual life,"
00:40:21,00:40:24,he was only had relationships with men.
00:40:24,00:40:25,"And I find that so bizarre,"
00:40:25,00:40:28,"because he came immediately after Oscar Wilde,"
00:40:28,00:40:30,"who obviously, you know, we know what happened to him."
00:40:30,00:40:32,"And then immediately before Alan Turing,"
00:40:32,00:40:34,but there was obviously this relaxation
00:40:34,00:40:36,for this 30-year period.
00:40:36,00:40:38,And so he was really promiscuous
00:40:38,00:40:41,"and he had this love triangle with Litton Strati,"
00:40:41,00:40:45,who then became very jealous of him going out with someone else.
00:40:45,00:40:47,"And it was Litton Strati who said things like,"
00:40:47,00:40:50,"his common sense is enough to freeze a volcano,"
00:40:50,00:40:52,which you can really imagine.
00:40:52,00:40:55,"And he said he hated how he treats his love affairs statistically,"
00:40:55,00:40:56,which is kind of true.
00:40:56,00:40:58,He kept it to the other spreadsheet.
00:40:58,00:41:00,"He had no cell spreadsheet, didn't he?"
00:41:00,00:41:01,He did.
00:41:01,00:41:03,"He wrote, well, it may not have been full on spreadsheet,"
00:41:03,00:41:06,"but he used to record the numbers in his diary,"
00:41:06,00:41:09,"which, you know, if you were just a number in someone's diary,"
00:41:09,00:41:10,"well, I'd be quite proud."
00:41:10,00:41:12,"It depends on the number, doesn't it?"
00:41:12,00:41:13,I want to be registered.
00:41:13,00:41:17,"If it's a scoreboard, then great."
00:41:17,00:41:18,They were high numbers.
00:41:18,00:41:20,"Yeah, didn't he have lots of codes or something"
00:41:20,00:41:22,for everything that they did?
00:41:22,00:41:24,"I haven't gotten this written down,"
00:41:24,00:41:28,but I think he would have sex with someone
00:41:28,00:41:31,"and then he would have, like, AS for anal sex,"
00:41:31,00:41:33,"or, you know, different things for different things."
00:41:33,00:41:37,"And then I think he would give people by their initials,"
00:41:37,00:41:39,"but then if it was just a dalliance,"
00:41:39,00:41:42,"it would be bloke in a hedge or, you know,"
00:41:42,00:41:44,"whatever, it's like something."
00:41:44,00:41:45,Look at hedge.
00:41:45,00:41:47,I apologize about throwing my suitcase onto him.
00:41:47,00:41:51,"But I think it was that it was, like, there would be no names."
00:41:51,00:41:53,It would just be this person in this situation.
00:41:53,00:41:55,"Yeah, I'd be like, ""Bell boy."""
00:41:55,00:41:58,"Yeah, you had the suite of the National Gallery,"
00:41:58,00:42:01,"the soldier of the baths, the French conscript,"
00:42:01,00:42:03,the lift boy at Voxel.
00:42:03,00:42:04,Really?
00:42:04,00:42:05,Lift boy at Voxel.
00:42:05,00:42:05,Wow.
00:42:05,00:42:07,And still no blue plaque at Voxel.
00:42:07,00:42:10,Outrageous.
00:42:10,00:42:12,He also revolutionized economics.
00:42:12,00:42:13,Wow.
00:42:13,00:42:16,"Which, it's incredible."
00:42:16,00:42:19,"And he, so he had only studied economics"
00:42:19,00:42:23,for eight weeks during his student days.
00:42:23,00:42:24,He never sat an examiner.
00:42:24,00:42:26,He studied classics and maths.
00:42:26,00:42:28,And then he only started properly going into it
00:42:28,00:42:32,when he was offered a lectureship in economics age 25.
00:42:32,00:42:35,And then he just turned up and started revolutionizing the art.
00:42:35,00:42:39,"And then he almost went bankrupt three times in his life,"
00:42:39,00:42:42,despite being one of the greatest economists of history.
00:42:42,00:42:43,"Hey, it was the great depression."
00:42:43,00:42:44,That was one of them.
00:42:44,00:42:46,You can't blame him for that.
00:42:46,00:42:48,"But what about the other two, I didn't know."
00:42:48,00:42:52,So the first one was when England went to the Golden Standard
00:42:52,00:42:54,as in peg the pound with the gold.
00:42:54,00:42:56,And he gambled against that happening
00:42:56,00:42:57,and lost shit ton of money.
00:42:57,00:43:01,And then he speculated against the war.
00:43:01,00:43:02,He didn't think the war would happen.
00:43:02,00:43:04,And he lost a shit ton of money on that.
00:43:04,00:43:07,"And then the great depression, which I think we can understand."
00:43:07,00:43:09,"Actually, I mean all of it, we can kind of understand."
00:43:09,00:43:11,But gosh.
00:43:11,00:43:12,My gamble.
00:43:12,00:43:13,"Yeah, he's a gambler."
00:43:13,00:43:18,"But he got one thing really right, which was about the Treaty of Versailles."
00:43:18,00:43:22,So he was present in Versailles as the representative
00:43:22,00:43:24,"for the treasury, financial rep."
00:43:24,00:43:28,"And in 1919, he was arguing these compensation payments"
00:43:28,00:43:30,that you're suggesting Germany makes.
00:43:30,00:43:31,They are too high.
00:43:31,00:43:33,And this is an insane impulse.
00:43:33,00:43:36,And it will lead to disaster in the long run.
00:43:36,00:43:38,And he was ignored.
00:43:38,00:43:40,"He was kind of kept out of the room, actually."
00:43:40,00:43:42,"And so he was left to try and, you know,"
00:43:42,00:43:44,he and a couple of other reps were advising around the edges
00:43:44,00:43:46,saying this may not work.
00:43:46,00:43:48,"And he failed, basically, because the impulse to punish Germany"
00:43:48,00:43:49,was very strong.
00:43:49,00:43:50,But he was proved right.
00:43:50,00:43:51,Him and Churchill.
00:43:51,00:43:53,I feel like Churchill said the same things.
00:43:53,00:43:56,"They were just outside the room, bitching about a stupid Versailles."
00:43:56,00:43:57,Wow.
00:43:57,00:43:59,But they were laughing in their faces.
00:43:59,00:44:00,20 years later.
00:44:00,00:44:02,"One thing that he didn't get right was he said,"
00:44:02,00:44:04,"oh, I don't think he's going to get right."
00:44:04,00:44:07,"As he said, that by 2030, everyone in the Western world"
00:44:07,00:44:10,will be working a 15-hour work week.
00:44:10,00:44:12,"Now, this is prediction."
00:44:12,00:44:16,"If things go really badly wrong, we might be."
00:44:16,00:44:19,He thought that only worker-holics would be working more than that.
00:44:19,00:44:21,And everyone else progression would get so much
00:44:21,00:44:22,that you could do that amount of work
00:44:22,00:44:24,and you'd get paid enough that the rest of your time
00:44:24,00:44:25,you could be at leisure.
00:44:25,00:44:26,"Because basically, technology would have"
00:44:26,00:44:28,been able to do stuff for us.
00:44:28,00:44:29,"That was his idea, yeah."
00:44:29,00:44:32,"But why he didn't realize is that as technology goes up,"
00:44:32,00:44:36,so does the number of people who have to work at that technology.
00:44:36,00:44:38,How do robots actually just make more work for us?
00:44:38,00:44:38,They do.
00:44:38,00:44:39,They do.
00:44:39,00:44:40,People don't realize that.
00:44:40,00:44:42,Not supposed to happen.
00:44:42,00:44:44,"But he did think that a very sensible thing,"
00:44:44,00:44:47,which was that the obsession with money that society has is insane.
00:44:47,00:44:50,He thought it was like this crazy social pathology.
00:44:50,00:44:52,Because why do you want money?
00:44:52,00:44:53,What you want is leisure.
00:44:53,00:44:54,What makes humans happy is leisure time.
00:44:54,00:44:56,"And so he thought, well, we should all be striving towards"
00:44:56,00:44:59,is that three hours work a day.
00:44:59,00:45:01,Then it sounds like a good idea.
00:45:01,00:45:02,Does fingers crossed?
00:45:02,00:45:06,"2030 is still 10 years away, guys."
00:45:06,00:45:08,"He had this weird thing, just to go about his personal life."
00:45:08,00:45:10,Now we've covered the economics.
00:45:10,00:45:13,"So he had a really lovely marriage, as far as I can tell."
00:45:13,00:45:17,"He married a ballerina called Lydia Lopperkova, or Lopokava."
00:45:17,00:45:19,But he was very confused by this.
00:45:19,00:45:21,"First, he started falling in love with women"
00:45:21,00:45:22,and became a bit confused by that.
00:45:22,00:45:24,"The first woman he fell in love with, he said,"
00:45:24,00:45:26,"""I seem to have fallen in love with Ray a little bit,"
00:45:26,00:45:28,"but as she isn't male, I haven't been able to think"
00:45:28,00:45:30,"of any suitable steps to take."""
00:45:30,00:45:32,Asked a man in hedge for his opinion.
00:45:32,00:45:33,He is also stumped.
00:45:33,00:45:37,Wow.
00:45:37,00:45:39,He married this ballerina eventually.
00:45:39,00:45:44,"And he took her on honeymoon to, I think it was Sussex,"
00:45:44,00:45:46,but he had this honeymoon where he invited some other people.
00:45:46,00:45:47,And one of the people he invited was
00:45:47,00:45:50,"Vickenstein, the philosopher of Vickenstein,"
00:45:50,00:45:53,who was not that much a laugh to have a honeymoon with him.
00:45:53,00:45:57,He sounds really unpleasant.
00:45:57,00:46:00,"Apparently, he spent the whole six days making her feel like shit."
00:46:00,00:46:04,"She was a bit lower social class, maybe wasn't intellectual."
00:46:04,00:46:06,"Yeah, making her feel really stupid."
00:46:06,00:46:08,"And eventually, she apparently made a remark"
00:46:08,00:46:10,about how beautiful a tree was.
00:46:10,00:46:12,"And he said, ""What do you mean by that?"
00:46:12,00:46:15,"Challenging her to explain herself."""
00:46:15,00:46:16,And she just burst into tears.
00:46:16,00:46:16,Wow. Wow.
00:46:16,00:46:17,And that's what he can't.
00:46:17,00:46:24,"When Keen's first saw his future wife at the ballet I read,"
00:46:24,00:46:27,he described her as a rotten dancer with a stiff bottom.
00:46:27,00:46:30,"It's not very nice, is it?"
00:46:30,00:46:31,It's not very nice.
00:46:31,00:46:32,"Although, actually, a stiff bottom."
00:46:32,00:46:35,"I don't know, that could be nice thing, the stiff bottom."
00:46:35,00:46:35,Yeah.
00:46:35,00:46:38,Is that so often not when paired with rotten dancer?
00:46:38,00:46:38,Oh.
00:46:38,00:46:45,"I have a couple of art things, just of hidden art."
00:46:45,00:46:51,"So a few years back, there was a guy who was watching a movie"
00:46:51,00:46:52,with his daughter.
00:46:52,00:46:55,"And in it, in the movie, I was watching was Stuart Little."
00:46:55,00:46:59,"And in the movie, in the background, he noticed this painting"
00:46:59,00:47:03,that looked suspiciously similar to a lost avant-garde painting
00:47:03,00:47:05,that was from Hungary.
00:47:05,00:47:08,"So sorry, can I just say Stuart Little isn't animated, is it?"
00:47:08,00:47:11,"Stuart Little himself is animated, but the rest of it"
00:47:11,00:47:12,has got Hugh Laurie.
00:47:12,00:47:13,"And it's, yeah."
00:47:13,00:47:15,"Yeah, so in the background of the house that Stuart"
00:47:15,00:47:16,Lives in is this painting.
00:47:16,00:47:18,"And he's going, I swear to God, I've seen that painting"
00:47:18,00:47:19,from somewhere before.
00:47:19,00:47:22,And he had a little black and white picture of it.
00:47:22,00:47:23,It was 90 years old.
00:47:23,00:47:25,And it had been lost for nine decades.
00:47:25,00:47:27,And he got in contact with the production.
00:47:27,00:47:29,"And he said, do you still have this painting?"
00:47:29,00:47:30,It took two years for them to get back.
00:47:30,00:47:34,"And eventually, the lady who was in charge of the dressing"
00:47:34,00:47:36,"for the house said, yeah, I found it at some market."
00:47:36,00:47:37,I bought it for nothing.
00:47:37,00:47:40,And they've now established that this is the lost work
00:47:40,00:47:43,of an artist called Robert Burrani.
00:47:43,00:47:46,It does two years to reply to an email.
00:47:46,00:47:48,It was a very successful film Stuart Little.
00:47:48,00:47:50,And they had a sequel to reply to it.
00:47:50,00:47:52,They had a sequel to make.
00:47:52,00:47:54,It makes me feel a lot better about my email.
00:47:54,00:47:58,So that is the main takeaway for me as well.
00:47:58,00:48:00,"Yeah, crazy."
00:48:00,00:48:04,"There was another incident in 2008, where a Norman Rockwell painting,"
00:48:04,00:48:06,"really famous for Norman Rockwell painting,"
00:48:06,00:48:08,was found hidden behind a false wall.
00:48:08,00:48:12,"And this was, it was worth $15.4 million."
00:48:12,00:48:14,"And the reason that had happened, it was this weird story."
00:48:14,00:48:17,So it was really famous because it had been on the cover
00:48:17,00:48:19,of magazine in the '50s.
00:48:19,00:48:23,And it was bought by a cartoonist called Don Tract Junior.
00:48:23,00:48:26,And he just bought it for $900 in 1960.
00:48:26,00:48:29,And he sort of displayed it people thought for years afterwards.
00:48:29,00:48:31,"People would come around and be like, oh yeah,"
00:48:31,00:48:33,Don's got that great picture.
00:48:33,00:48:35,And people were a bit confused because when they look closely
00:48:35,00:48:39,"at the one he had, it didn't match up with the magazine cover."
00:48:39,00:48:40,So a bit odd.
00:48:40,00:48:43,"Anyway, he died a few years ago, 2008 or 2007."
00:48:43,00:48:45,And his sons went through his home.
00:48:45,00:48:48,They discovered an entire false wall they'd had built.
00:48:48,00:48:51,And behind it was the real painting.
00:48:51,00:48:55,And he'd painted a copy of that to show to the public.
00:48:55,00:48:58,And his son's theory about why he'd hidden the original
00:48:58,00:49:01,is because he disliked his wife and he then divorced so much
00:49:01,00:49:03,that he was worried she would take it.
00:49:03,00:49:05,"Wow, how did it?"
00:49:05,00:49:07,"Oh my god, that's a lot to do, isn't it?"
00:49:07,00:49:09,"That is a lot, it's incredible."
00:49:09,00:49:14,"In '50s or '50s, Leonardo did a fresco."
00:49:14,00:49:16,"We're just first naming Leonardo, aren't we?"
00:49:16,00:49:20,"Oh, sorry, Leonardo DiCaprio."
00:49:20,00:49:22,Leonardo da Vinci made this fresco.
00:49:22,00:49:26,And it was in the grand meeting hall of Florence's Palazzo
00:49:26,00:49:27,"Betio, okay."
00:49:27,00:49:30,"And then the Medici's came along and they decided,"
00:49:30,00:49:33,"""I don't really like that, I want something else in that place."""
00:49:33,00:49:36,So they commissioned the architect Giordio Vassari
00:49:36,00:49:39,"to renovate the room and to put something else in its place,"
00:49:39,00:49:41,which means that we've lost that fresco.
00:49:41,00:49:44,But we know that Vassari was a big fan of Leonardo.
00:49:44,00:49:48,And so we think that he probably wouldn't have destroyed it.
00:49:48,00:49:50,"And in that room, if you go there now,"
00:49:50,00:49:52,there are two words painted in the whole room.
00:49:52,00:49:56,"And they are ""serts a trover,"" which means ""seek and you shall find."""
00:49:56,00:49:58,"And we know that at another time,"
00:49:58,00:50:01,"he has, in another time, put a fake wall in place"
00:50:01,00:50:04,to hide something that he didn't want to damage.
00:50:04,00:50:06,"So we think that somewhere in that room,"
00:50:06,00:50:09,there might be Leonardo's lost fresco.
00:50:09,00:50:10,Wow.
00:50:10,00:50:11,How hard is it to search a room?
00:50:11,00:50:14,"Well, yeah, but I guess if he's got art on the wall,"
00:50:14,00:50:15,he's painted his own--
00:50:15,00:50:16,He's painted his own fresco.
00:50:16,00:50:17,He's got a good painting.
00:50:17,00:50:19,"Yeah, just tear it down."
00:50:19,00:50:20,"Yeah, I guess Leonardo."
00:50:20,00:50:23,"Apparently, and I'm quoting this from the article I read it,"
00:50:23,00:50:26,"it says, ""Excavation has been tangled for years"
00:50:26,00:50:29,"in the famously convoluted Italian bureaucracy."""
00:50:29,00:50:31,"It's actually the people who worked on Stuart Little,"
00:50:31,00:50:34,who were in charge of this renovation.
00:50:34,00:50:35,How many fake walls are going to help?
00:50:35,00:50:38,These are going to be tiny rooms eventually.
00:50:38,00:50:39,You're right.
00:50:39,00:50:42,I'm sure it used to be able to fit the dining room table in here.
00:50:42,00:50:49,I've got a fact about war art and art being hidden in times of war.
00:50:49,00:50:52,"So the second world war, I think we may have mentioned before"
00:50:52,00:50:53,that all the art in the National Gallery
00:50:53,00:50:55,was sent to a cave in Wales.
00:50:55,00:50:56,Yeah.
00:50:56,00:51:00,"And by the end of the war, it was the most high-tech cave"
00:51:00,00:51:02,"in the world, because they built a railway inside the cave"
00:51:02,00:51:04,to move all the art around.
00:51:04,00:51:05,It was cool.
00:51:05,00:51:07,And I really like how it got there.
00:51:07,00:51:09,So the paintings were sent in post office vans
00:51:09,00:51:13,and Cadbury delivery tracks to avoid attracting attention to them.
00:51:13,00:51:14,"Oh, wow."
00:51:14,00:51:16,So I can't think of anything that would be attracted to bar
00:51:16,00:51:19,and driving through my village in Wales.
00:51:19,00:51:20,And you're right.
00:51:20,00:51:23,"Well, suddenly hundreds of Cadbury delivery trucks are driving through."
00:51:23,00:51:25,"In the war, when chocolate was rationed--"
00:51:25,00:51:26,Exactly.
00:51:26,00:51:29,"But there's one painting, which gave them such problems."
00:51:29,00:51:33,"So it's by Van Dyke, and it's a portrait of Charles I, right?"
00:51:33,00:51:34,And it's a biggie.
00:51:34,00:51:39,"It's 12 feet by 9 1/2 feet, and it's on a truck."
00:51:39,00:51:41,So I presume that was wrapped up.
00:51:41,00:51:45,"But there was a very, very tight bend in the road"
00:51:45,00:51:46,just before they get to the thing.
00:51:46,00:51:48,So there's no other way of getting there.
00:51:48,00:51:50,Very tight bend in the road.
00:51:50,00:51:54,"And at that same point, there's a railway bridge over the road."
00:51:54,00:51:56,And they calculated it would be possible to do it.
00:51:56,00:51:59,But you'd have to pivot really--
00:51:59,00:52:00,Pivot?
00:52:00,00:52:02,Pivot really carefully.
00:52:02,00:52:04,And they didn't want to take the risk.
00:52:04,00:52:07,So the way they solved it was they took up
00:52:07,00:52:09,the surface of the road.
00:52:09,00:52:11,They just destroyed the surface of the road
00:52:11,00:52:12,to get several more inches of clearance.
00:52:12,00:52:13,Wow.
00:52:13,00:52:14,I know.
00:52:14,00:52:16,They just-- because it was such an important piece of art.
00:52:16,00:52:18,"And if you go there now, you can see,"
00:52:18,00:52:20,"at the point where the bridge is, the curb"
00:52:20,00:52:22,is really high above the road.
00:52:22,00:52:24,Because the road is several inches there.
00:52:24,00:52:25,"Oh, it's still there."
00:52:25,00:52:26,I'd love to know where that is.
00:52:26,00:52:27,That's amazing.
00:52:27,00:52:30,"Which van Dyke, who are we talking about?"
00:52:30,00:52:32,Van Dyke.
00:52:32,00:52:34,"Yes, Dick Van Dyke and Leonardo DiCaprio,"
00:52:34,00:52:39,the two famous Renaissance artists.
00:52:39,00:52:41,[MUSIC PLAYING]
00:52:41,00:52:42,"OK, that's it."
