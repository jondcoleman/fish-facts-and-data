1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:02,320
 - Hi everyone, before we start this week's show,

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:04,080
 we want to tell you about the winners

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:07,840
 of this year's prestigious Heinz Oberhummer Award

4
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:09,560
 for Science Communication.

5
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:11,760
 - That's exciting, okay, who got it?

6
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:13,000
 - Us, no.

7
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,120
 - Yes, that is amazing.

8
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:16,400
 - It's so cool.

9
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:18,960
 And what it means is that we get to go to Vienna

10
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:20,480
 and we're gonna record a podcast there

11
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:23,000
 and it's gonna be a 300th episode

12
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,200
 and guess what, you can get tickets.

13
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:26,680
 - That was the funniest piece of acting I've ever seen

14
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:28,240
 there at the start, by the way, guys.

15
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:29,320
 But that is indeed correct.

16
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:31,160
 If you are listening from Vienna or Austria

17
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:33,400
 or if you fancy a trip there on the 25th of November,

18
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:36,560
 then go to nosuchthingasaffish.com

19
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:38,360
 and you'll see the link there to get tickets

20
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:40,520
 and see us perform our 300th episode.

21
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:43,080
 - Is this in the world I see before me?

22
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:43,920
 - No, I'll go.

23
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,080
 - Oh, that was good.

24
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:46,520
 - Now, pipe down on with the show.

25
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:49,360
 (blues music)

26
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:50,840
 - Who the fuck is this?

27
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:53,120
 (blues music)

28
00:00:53,120 --> 00:01:01,520
 - Who's not ready?

29
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,280
 - I'm not ready, but Karen's not ready.

30
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:04,280
 - Karen's not ready.

31
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:06,640
 - Hello and welcome to another episode

32
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:09,240
 of nosuchthingasaffish, a weekly podcast

33
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:12,160
 coming to you from the QI offices in Covert Garden.

34
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:13,280
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

35
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,360
 I am sitting here with Anna Chazinski,

36
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,720
 Andrew Hunter Murray and James Harkin.

37
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:20,040
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones

38
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:22,880
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days

39
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:26,080
 and in no particular order, here we go.

40
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:28,480
 Starting with you, James.

41
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:30,080
 - Oh, it really?

42
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:31,840
 I thought it was what are you guys first?

43
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:37,360
 - My fact this week is that the US Navy's Doomsday aircraft,

44
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:40,080
 which was designed to survive a nuclear attack,

45
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:42,920
 was recently taken out by a single bird.

46
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:46,680
 Okay, this was in the news.

47
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,160
 A few people might have seen it.

48
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:51,120
 The US Navy called it a class A mishap.

49
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:53,240
 (laughing)

50
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:56,240
 - That feels like something that would be an PG Woodhouse novel.

51
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,080
 - I'm telling you what, jeez,

52
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:58,960
 this is a class A mishap we've just had.

53
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:02,760
 - It was the E6B Mercury.

54
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:06,240
 It's a Boeing 707, which supposedly,

55
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,920
 if there is a nuclear bomb that goes off nearby,

56
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:10,320
 it's supposed to be okay.

57
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:12,640
 But actually, a bird got into its engine

58
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:15,080
 and it had to make an emergency stop.

59
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:17,920
 The engine had to be replaced and it cost them

60
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,320
 about $2 million.

61
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:20,560
 - Oh, wow.

62
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,120
 - That is a class A mishap.

63
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,120
 - That is.

64
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,960
 And so I was really curious about this plane

65
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:28,200
 because it's sort of, it's like the less fancy,

66
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:30,920
 but tougher brother of Air Force One, basically.

67
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:32,560
 - Yeah, although Air Force One is anything

68
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,880
 that the president's on, of course.

69
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:34,720
 - Yes.

70
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,600
 - But the particular Air Force One that we know about,

71
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:39,320
 yeah, it's a souped-up version of this one.

72
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:42,000
 - Yeah, it's all nuclear command centers

73
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,840
 as opposed to nice beds and desks and cool press rooms

74
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:46,880
 and things like that.

75
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:49,040
 But I wonder, 'cause it's, I read this,

76
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,640
 I couldn't believe that it could survive a nuclear attack.

77
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:53,040
 And they say it can survive a nuclear attack.

78
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,560
 When I just wonder how close it can be

79
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,400
 for a nuclear attack.

80
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,880
 'Cause if you drop a nuclear bomb on it, it would,

81
00:02:58,880 --> 00:02:59,720
 - Yeah.

82
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:02,480
 - In many ways, you know, most of the people in the world

83
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:06,280
 could survive a nuclear attack depending on where the bomb is.

84
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:08,000
 - Yeah, that's absolutely true.

85
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,760
 - If a bomb stops in Australia, I reckon I'll be okay.

86
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:13,400
 - They said it was, they said they've got all sorts of,

87
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,440
 I read they had mesh to prevent radiation

88
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,280
 and other things.

89
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,400
 - Yeah, they have that, you know.

90
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:20,280
 - And also, it's strong enough to survive the pulses

91
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:23,240
 of electromagnetic energy that come from a nuclear bomb.

92
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,080
 - Oh, okay.

93
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,160
 - Cosumably, like you say, not if it lands on the nose.

94
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:27,320
 (laughing)

95
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:28,480
 I do see what you mean by that.

96
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:31,320
 - Maybe it's 'cause it can only flyably for about 10 hours,

97
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:33,120
 10 hours worth of fuel.

98
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,280
 So maybe it has to make a landing in an area

99
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,760
 that's been recently bombed and all this meshing and stuff

100
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:40,200
 means that you would survive on the inside

101
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:43,480
 and not be turned into radioactive spider.

102
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:45,200
 (laughing)

103
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,480
 - I lost my thread at the end there.

104
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:47,840
 - No, you couldn't tell.

105
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,240
 (laughing)

106
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,440
 They are very cool.

107
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:51,280
 - Yeah.

108
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,280
 - Do we know what kind of bird it was?

109
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,760
 Was it at least a big bird?

110
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,840
 - We don't know what kind of, it was a big bird

111
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,720
 from Sesame Street, if that's what you're thinking.

112
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:58,560
 - Thank God.

113
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,520
 - Famously can't fly.

114
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,760
 We don't know what kind of bird it is.

115
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:04,480
 Although they have lots of labs in America

116
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,120
 who can find this kind of thing out.

117
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:09,480
 They like to scrape bits of bird off airplanes, don't they?

118
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:10,760
 And work out what's.

119
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:13,520
 - Yeah, using the DNA, they'll do it.

120
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,960
 And you just send in.

121
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:17,640
 There's a thing called, if you have a bird strike

122
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:19,080
 on your plane, it's called snarge.

123
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:21,080
 - Snarge, so there's, yeah, that's right.

124
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:23,160
 - And I wanted to know where this word came from.

125
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,000
 Did anyone find out?

126
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:24,840
 - No.

127
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:25,680
 - Okay, as far as I can see,

128
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,600
 it comes from the Smithsonian Institution's

129
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,800
 feather identification laboratory.

130
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:32,400
 And I think just the lab sciences have just called it snarge

131
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,880
 and it feels like it might be an acronym or something,

132
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,240
 but I don't really know.

133
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,360
 And when they first came up with it, one of the other words

134
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:40,960
 of phrases they used was birdic.

135
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,320
 - Snarge is quite onomatopoeic.

136
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,720
 I don't imagine they just sort of thought,

137
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:46,360
 "Oh, this sound sort of tells you that it's...

138
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:48,040
 - It's a gooey end."

139
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,960
 - Yeah, maybe snarge.

140
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:51,280
 - Snarge.

141
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:54,800
 - And in this lab, they will test things and work out

142
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,840
 exactly what will happen when any bird hits any aircraft.

143
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:01,040
 And they have invented the bird avoidance model

144
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,040
 or bam!

145
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:04,480
 - Nice.

146
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,320
 - Very cool.

147
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:08,160
 This isn't the only bird strike that hit a military plane

148
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,200
 this year with scary consequences.

149
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:13,840
 Yeah, so earlier this year, an Air Force A10 was flying

150
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:17,760
 through America over Florida and it got hit by a bird as well,

151
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:18,680
 hit the engine.

152
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:20,880
 But as a result of being hit by the bird,

153
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:23,160
 something in the plane malfunctioned and it ended up

154
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:26,920
 dropping three dummy rounds, basically three massive bombs,

155
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:31,360
 but they weren't charged over Florida and landed in Florida.

156
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,320
 And I mean, it was just so lucky that they were fake bombs.

157
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,800
 Because otherwise America would have just bombed its citizens.

158
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,400
 And then I read that story and I think if you'd have gone up to it

159
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:41,720
 and started prodding it with a stick, you could have got injured.

160
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:42,560
 - Yes.

161
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,560
 - That one people not to go near it, right?

162
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,400
 - Exactly.

163
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,400
 - You're still slightly charged.

164
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,160
 - Yeah, they're like, this is completely harmless.

165
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:50,000
 It's just the dummy bomb, but also please do not handle it

166
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,560
 under any circumstances.

167
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,160
 So if you are, and I don't know if they've found them.

168
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,440
 So if you are in Florida and you see,

169
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:55,800
 I think they're about 25 pounds.

170
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:59,120
 So they are quite, they're not huge, but in those spot ones.

171
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,680
 - Well, they said where it is, roughly.

172
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:05,040
 They said that in the general vicinity of two kilometers west

173
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:07,440
 of highway one, two, nine, every single location.

174
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:10,680
 But that's quite a big margin of error, I would say.

175
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:11,520
 - Yeah.

176
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:12,360
 - Yeah.

177
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:14,480
 Can we just say one more thing about these weird planes?

178
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,320
 - Yes, ma'am.

179
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:18,680
 - So they're called the National Airborne Operation Centers.

180
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:21,160
 And these are the ones, I don't know if you guys remember,

181
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:23,360
 but we spoke, I mentioned them a while ago,

182
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,000
 and you guys did not believe the fact that I said.

183
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:26,840
 - Okay.

184
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:29,120
 - These are the ones which have antennas

185
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,600
 which are five miles long.

186
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,640
 - Oh, yes.

187
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:32,480
 - Oh, you remember?

188
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,320
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

189
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:34,160
 - Have you checked that?

190
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,000
 - Yeah.

191
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,600
 - That's a long kite string, basically.

192
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,440
 - It's like a tail.

193
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,440
 It's like the plane's tail.

194
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:39,680
 Except planes already have tails.

195
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,400
 - It's like a second tail.

196
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,400
 - It's like a second tail.

197
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,240
 - Yeah.

198
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:46,680
 - And it's so it can communicate with submarines underwater.

199
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,640
 - Because they need extremely long waves.

200
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:49,480
 - Yeah.

201
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,320
 - Exactly.

202
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:52,800
 And the point of the plane is that they tie everything together.

203
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,840
 So they tie together the bombers,

204
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,400
 which have got nuclear weapons on them.

205
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:59,560
 They tie together submarines, which have got nuclear warheads,

206
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:02,640
 and the ballistic missiles in their silos,

207
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:04,760
 they can communicate with all of those

208
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:07,160
 and basically coordinate a nuclear attack

209
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,080
 if America wants to make one.

210
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:09,920
 - Yeah.

211
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,280
 - Or if it's been attacked and they wanted to retaliate.

212
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,080
 - What's amazing about these planes is that

213
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:16,920
 they have a crew basically on standby waiting for Doomsday.

214
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:19,200
 They're just there, maintaining the plane,

215
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:22,000
 while the other three are getting prepared for their next round.

216
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,680
 So they sort of swap spots as the ready plane.

217
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:26,720
 - So you come on your new shift and you go,

218
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,920
 "All right, Jeff, was it Doomsday on your shift?"

219
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:29,760
 - Yeah.

220
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:30,600
 - No, it wasn't Doomsday on my shift.

221
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,760
 - All right, okay, we'll see you after, see you in eight hours.

222
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:33,920
 - One day.

223
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:34,760
 - Yeah.

224
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:37,120
 - Bird strikes, though, kind of a big problem

225
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,800
 or a big thing that, you know,

226
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,400
 aircraft designers have to address.

227
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,320
 And the first bird strike is sighted

228
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:45,360
 as being Wilbur Wright of Wright Brothers' fame.

229
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,760
 - To the right.

230
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:49,520
 - Yeah, and it was in 1905.

231
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:52,400
 And it really raises my problem with the term bird strike

232
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,880
 because it always gives too much agency to the birds.

233
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:57,000
 And so in this case, it was 1905.

234
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,080
 So it was only a couple of years after the first ever

235
00:07:59,080 --> 00:07:59,920
 powered flight.

236
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:03,160
 And Wilbur Wright was putling about in his plane.

237
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:05,000
 And he wrote in his diary,

238
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,680
 "I twice passed over the fences into this bloke's cornfield

239
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:12,080
 and I chased flocks of birds on two rounds

240
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:15,080
 and I managed to kill one in his engine

241
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:17,360
 which then fell on top of the surface of the wing

242
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,080
 and fell off when he did a sharp curve."

243
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:20,640
 So basically, he chased and harassed

244
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:22,880
 flocks of birds until he smashed into one

245
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:24,680
 and then he dumped it off his wing.

246
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,440
 And that's not a bird striking you.

247
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:27,440
 - That's a plane strike.

248
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,280
 - It's a plane strike.

249
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:29,120
 - Yeah.

250
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,560
 - I think that's what they should be called.

251
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:33,160
 - Do you, but then what if anything else hits the plane?

252
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:35,520
 - It could, oh, it could should be called bird receipt.

253
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:36,960
 (laughing)

254
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:39,000
 - Well, have you heard about the other kind of receipts

255
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,080
 that they have, they have frog receipts,

256
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:43,240
 they have turtle receipts, they have snake receipts.

257
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,880
 - Well, how high are those frogs jumping?

258
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:45,880
 - It's amazing, right?

259
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:50,160
 So according to these people who work at Smithsonian,

260
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:53,120
 they get, because things get carried up by the jet stream,

261
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:56,080
 often animals other than birds get hit by these planes.

262
00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:00,640
 And they quite recently got a rabbit that got hit by a plane.

263
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:01,480
 - No.

264
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:03,360
 - Yeah, so a rabbit receipt.

265
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,560
 (laughing)

266
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:05,720
 - Sorry, how does the rabbit get into there?

267
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:07,680
 It's pulled up by the jet stream.

268
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:08,520
 - By the jet stream.

269
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:09,360
 - By the jet stream.

270
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,560
 - By, you know, a tornado or.

271
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:11,400
 (laughing)

272
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,240
 - It's really quite rare.

273
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:15,480
 - It sounds unlikely, doesn't it?

274
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:17,040
 But this was actually in a Smithsonian.

275
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,040
 - Well, you guys believe this,

276
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:19,960
 and you don't believe a plane can have a long antenna.

277
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,920
 - I'm just trying to explore this a bit.

278
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:25,080
 - I think a lot of the animal sucks,

279
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:27,120
 'cause they aren't, they are not called birds dry catchely

280
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,120
 by people in the aviation.

281
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,280
 - They're called animals sucks.

282
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:30,400
 - They're not called animals sucks.

283
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:31,400
 (laughing)

284
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:33,080
 - They should be, they're called wildlife strikes,

285
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,160
 'cause of the variety.

286
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,480
 But the other ones who aren't birds seem to be mostly

287
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,320
 on runways.

288
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:39,600
 So in Florida, they have a bit of a crocodile problem,

289
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,360
 where I think one crocodile did actually jump up

290
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,520
 and hit the wing of a plane.

291
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:47,120
 - It's a big crocodile jump, it flipped itself up to the level

292
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,160
 of the plane apparently.

293
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,000
 - Wow.

294
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,360
 - This is the thing that happens in Florida occasion.

295
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:52,760
 - I mean, there was one, I know what you're saying,

296
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:54,960
 often on that, but this person who works

297
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:57,720
 at the Smithsonian Institution Feather Identification

298
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:01,960
 Laboratory said that they had a cat that was hit

299
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,760
 at high altitude.

300
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:04,600
 - What?

301
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:05,440
 - So such a shame.

302
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,360
 Only eight lives left for that whole cat.

303
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,200
 (laughing)

304
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,840
 - Could have been on the back of a broomstick.

305
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,240
 - Could have been, who knows?

306
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:12,440
 Who knows how it got there?

307
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:14,960
 - On the early airstrikes thing.

308
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:19,080
 Have you seen this amazing portrait of Eugene Gilbert,

309
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,440
 who was a French pilot.

310
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:23,880
 In 1911, he was flying from Paris to Madrid.

311
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:26,400
 So very early, exciting air race.

312
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:28,840
 And he was flying over the Pyrenees Mountains.

313
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:31,040
 And he got tangled up with an eagle.

314
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:33,120
 There was a mother eagle which flew down

315
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,400
 and attacked him basically.

316
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:37,160
 'Cause she was very protective of her area.

317
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:39,400
 And he started firing his pistol at it

318
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,480
 from inside the cockpit of this.

319
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:42,960
 - Well, it must have been a biplane, I think.

320
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:44,760
 Not to wound just to--

321
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:45,600
 - Just to scare it.

322
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,560
 - To scare it off, yeah.

323
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,400
 But someone who--

324
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:48,400
 - Should have thrown a cat at it.

325
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,240
 - Should have.

326
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,160
 (laughing)

327
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,280
 - But someone has painted a portrait of this happening.

328
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:54,120
 And it's an incredibly epic picture.

329
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:56,200
 - Wow, that's amazing.

330
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:58,400
 - We should say it's really, really rare as well.

331
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,240
 - Oh yeah.

332
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:03,480
 - So I think the amazing stat is that since 1912,

333
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:05,760
 there have been 250 deaths from bird strikes

334
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,960
 due to all flights ever.

335
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:10,040
 So it's incredibly unlikely.

336
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:12,440
 But obviously still it is quite important to avoid them.

337
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:15,120
 And the testing, have we mentioned the chicken gun before?

338
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,280
 - I don't think we have.

339
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:17,120
 - We have.

340
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:20,320
 - So there used to be experiments on plane engines

341
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,400
 in the testing phase where you would fire a bird

342
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:24,680
 from a gas cannon into the engine

343
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:27,680
 and see what happened, basically.

344
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:30,560
 And they've now replaced it, Boo,

345
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:35,560
 with a block of gelatin, which is the same density as,

346
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:36,560
 for example.

347
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,400
 Checking's about example 'cause they're flightless.

348
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:39,920
 They're probably not gonna end up in the engines,

349
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:42,080
 but yeah, as a goose.

350
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:45,640
 - Easy to get though, easier to pick up.

351
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:46,480
 - Very true.

352
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,320
 - And they used to put frozen ones in, didn't they?

353
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,920
 Because, and one theory was that,

354
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:52,560
 well, there are a few reasons you might do that.

355
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,960
 One might be because a frozen one would be,

356
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:57,040
 basically as hard as a bird can be.

357
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,200
 You know, I'm gonna get harder bird

358
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,040
 than a frozen chicken.

359
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,120
 - But you might as well then just do it with a rock.

360
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,680
 Why isn't your frozen chicken?

361
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,840
 - Well, one of the reasons is because they thought

362
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:07,480
 that if a bird was flying in and it was about to get hit,

363
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:08,920
 it might tense all of its muscles

364
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:10,400
 'cause it thought it was gonna get hit

365
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:13,160
 and that would be similar to a frozen chicken.

366
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:15,040
 - That seems exactly what you would do, isn't it?

367
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:15,880
 - That's what I would do.

368
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:16,720
 - Yeah.

369
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,520
 - But it is a stressful and situation to be in.

370
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:19,360
 - Yeah.

371
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:22,040
 - You wouldn't relax and go floppy, even if you knew

372
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:23,240
 that was what you were supposed to do

373
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:25,040
 to increase your chances of survival.

374
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:28,640
 - Apparently these days most of the testing

375
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:30,280
 is by computer simulation.

376
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:31,120
 - That makes more sense.

377
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,760
 - It does make more sense, but for me,

378
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:33,880
 it's not good enough.

379
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:34,720
 - No.

380
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:35,800
 - No, I want to be flying in a plane

381
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,680
 that's had a chicken fired at it.

382
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:40,480
 - Do you know what it is that kills the plane?

383
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,480
 - I would have thought it hits the engine

384
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:46,760
 and then it snarges all up and then it can't spin around

385
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:48,880
 that gets really hot and it sets on fire.

386
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:51,080
 - Can I just quickly say excellent use of snarge?

387
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:54,920
 - I don't think snarge is a verb.

388
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:57,200
 - I think it's any kind of word, yeah.

389
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,200
 - Yeah, right, fair enough.

390
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:01,400
 - Does it accidentally make one blade smash into another blade

391
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:02,720
 and then that causes all the...

392
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:05,080
 - Basically, it bends one blade in the engine.

393
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:07,640
 So what they're trying to do when they throw the chicken

394
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:09,920
 at it is make sure that the blades can withstand

395
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,280
 the chicken blow without bending.

396
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:13,760
 'Cause as soon as one bends and the engine stools.

397
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:16,000
 But the worst thing that can happen is if it hits

398
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,960
 or if something hits one of the fan blades in the engine

399
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:21,360
 or if there's just a bit of wear and tear and they snap,

400
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,960
 which does happen every few years.

401
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:25,520
 And that's the main plane sort of hazard

402
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:27,200
 that they're trying to test against

403
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,240
 because if one fan blade snaps,

404
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:31,080
 then it turns into kind of shrapnel.

405
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,440
 So it's spinning around really, really fast.

406
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:34,320
 It's inside the engine, turns into shrapnel

407
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,880
 and then it flies through the engine.

408
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:37,640
 So it breaks the whole engine down.

409
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:40,680
 And so they have to do these, like most of the money goes

410
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:44,480
 into doing these crazy tests where they have these fans.

411
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:47,240
 So like picture sort of a ceiling fan.

412
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:48,080
 And each plane...

413
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:49,080
 - No, no, no, no.

414
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:49,920
 (laughter)

415
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:52,480
 - Just remember last week's podcast at the Mulan Rouge.

416
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:55,000
 (laughter)

417
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,080
 - You're not a plane spotter.

418
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:58,800
 You're just a plane fan spotter.

419
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:02,280
 Each blade costs about the same as like a luxury car

420
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:03,120
 about 50 grand.

421
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:06,040
 So each fan is worth about nine million dollars

422
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:08,360
 'cause they're really special shapes.

423
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:10,040
 And they have to be an incredibly special light,

424
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:11,360
 but strong material.

425
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,600
 And then they have to throw stuff at them

426
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:16,920
 or explode them to see if they can still function

427
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:18,720
 with them exploded.

428
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,880
 - I've got a couple land-based bird strikes.

429
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:21,720
 - Okay.

430
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:23,320
 - Non-plane related.

431
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:26,080
 So do you know the Le Mans, the car race?

432
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:26,920
 - I do.

433
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:29,840
 The town of Le Mans is twinned with Bolton.

434
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:30,680
 - Is it?

435
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:32,280
 - Yeah, that's cool.

436
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:35,400
 So 1953, the winner was a guy called Duncan Hamilton,

437
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:38,360
 I believe his name was, and Duncan Hamilton won it

438
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:40,720
 despite being absolutely pissed off his face.

439
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:44,760
 He was so drunk, he and his buddy had done a practice circuit

440
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:47,160
 before the race, and this is a bit confusing,

441
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:49,080
 but they had the same plates as another car

442
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:51,080
 that was on there, which apparently is illegal.

443
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:52,960
 And so they got disqualified from the race.

444
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:54,240
 So they thought, "Well, we're on holiday.

445
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:55,240
 "Let's just go to the bar."

446
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:56,520
 I got absolutely tanked.

447
00:14:56,520 --> 00:15:00,440
 And then the guy who was the manager of the Jaguar team,

448
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:03,040
 who they raced for, called Lofty England.

449
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:03,880
 - Ow.

450
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:05,680
 (all laughing)

451
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:08,040
 - He should be the head of the Brexit party.

452
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:08,880
 (all laughing)

453
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,920
 - He persuaded the organizers to let them both race,

454
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:12,320
 but they were completely smashed,

455
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,320
 but they did it anyway.

456
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:14,640
 And in between the pit stops,

457
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:17,000
 they were desperately trying to sober up Hamilton with coffee.

458
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,880
 So it sort of changed your wheels and give you a drink.

459
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:21,520
 And this is a 24-hour race.

460
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:25,400
 It's one of the most long-hard and enduring races.

461
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,960
 But halfway through the race, or not halfway,

462
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:30,320
 but along the race, a bird,

463
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,800
 flew into his face at 130 miles an hour.

464
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,480
 (all laughing)

465
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,440
 But they think, 'cause he was so wasted,

466
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:38,320
 he kind of shrugged off the pain of it

467
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,520
 and managed to continue.

468
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:41,040
 And one, they won the race,

469
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,800
 despite being smashed in the face.

470
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,080
 - That would take your face off.

471
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:46,720
 - I'm not going to ride on the boat, if it was a wreck.

472
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,760
 - Yeah, if it was an albatross.

473
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:50,160
 - Yeah, it would be incredible.

474
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,000
 (all laughing)

475
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,600
 - I mean, there was a thing, Fabio, who is...

476
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:55,440
 - Fabio.

477
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,720
 - Fabio's a male model.

478
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:57,920
 He appears on romance books.

479
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,080
 He was in the, I can't believe it's not Butter ads.

480
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:01,560
 - It's weird that you expected us to know that,

481
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:04,000
 but if I'd have to guess, I would have said he was a male model.

482
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:04,840
 - He's the male model.

483
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:08,680
 - He was on, I think, something like 200 romance novels.

484
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:11,080
 - Yeah, he looks like Conan the Barbarian

485
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:12,640
 who's got this huge, flowing blood loss.

486
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:14,160
 - Huge main, the most beautiful...

487
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:15,400
 - Guys, guys, calm down.

488
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:16,240
 (all laughing)

489
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,240
 You know who you're talking about now?

490
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:18,080
 - He's a guy.

491
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:20,160
 - Yeah, he was known as the most beautiful man in the world.

492
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,160
 Anyway, he was opening a roller coaster,

493
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:24,120
 and so he was on the ride.

494
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:27,840
 He was going 73 miles an hour down the first drop

495
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:30,960
 when a 10-pound goose flew into his face.

496
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:33,880
 - Oh my God, I'd love it if the photo went off just at that moment.

497
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:35,600
 (all laughing)

498
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:38,240
 - Oh, wow, that, and then there are photos of him.

499
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,080
 - Of him.

500
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:40,920
 - Of him being hit, but of him coming back in,

501
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:42,680
 just spitting feathers out of his mouth.

502
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:45,280
 - Yeah, his entire face is bloodied.

503
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:46,760
 - He was on the roller coaster ride

504
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:49,440
 with a load of sort of models and things like this,

505
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:52,000
 because it was a big PR launch of the roller coaster.

506
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:52,840
 - Yeah.

507
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:54,440
 - And you just see the carriage coming back in.

508
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:57,600
 All of the traumatized, he's covered in blood.

509
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,840
 - He's got a broken nose, yeah.

510
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:01,320
 - Do you not think it might have been a jealous fellow model

511
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:03,800
 who's just taken a goose at the roller coaster?

512
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:04,640
 (all laughing)

513
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,120
 - Well, his looks were in forever.

514
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:07,360
 - No, of course it, you guys.

515
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:08,360
 - Roon Fabius looks.

516
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:09,600
 - That's a beautiful man in the world.

517
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:11,840
 - They were actually improved, yeah, the goose.

518
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:14,440
 (upbeat music)

519
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:18,440
 - Okay, it's time for fact number two,

520
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:19,760
 and that is my fact.

521
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:22,480
 My fact this week is that when nylon stockings

522
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:24,880
 became rationed during World War II,

523
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:27,760
 department stores set up leg makeup bars

524
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,160
 where women could have stockings

525
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:31,880
 drawn onto their legs instead.

526
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:32,720
 - Very cool.

527
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,880
 - Yeah, they would just go to the shop

528
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,560
 and they would take hours at a time,

529
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:39,520
 and they would draw the hem line at the back of their leg,

530
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,400
 and they would put powders and so on.

531
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:44,000
 - Would they kind of paint the leg

532
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
 to look a slightly different color

533
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
 and then draw the line?

534
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,080
 - Yeah, do you put it in like an old cup of tea

535
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:49,800
 for a little while until it stays?

536
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:50,640
 (all laughing)

537
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:51,480
 - Like the leg.

538
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:52,960
 - The leg is a big cup of tea.

539
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,640
 (all laughing)

540
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:55,480
 - That's a nice idea.

541
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:57,200
 You could put everyone in a jacuzzi

542
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,040
 just sitting around the edges.

543
00:17:59,040 --> 00:17:59,880
 - Yeah.

544
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:00,840
 - And then you could everyone can have a cup

545
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:02,440
 and just take some of the tea.

546
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:03,720
 - That would be lovely.

547
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:06,320
 - Well, they did use to do it with gravy, I think, didn't they?

548
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:07,160
 - Right.

549
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,000
 - And with coffee, yeah.

550
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,360
 Because I think, so it's sort of like,

551
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,600
 women used to just paint the lines up themselves,

552
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:12,760
 I think. - Yes.

553
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:14,800
 - Of and no, I didn't realize they had the salon

554
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:16,880
 specifically to do it for the wealthier.

555
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,480
 I suppose you don't get a wobbly line.

556
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:19,480
 But yeah, if you were doing it at home,

557
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:22,680
 you'd dip your leg in a sort of vat of gravy

558
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:24,840
 or cocoa powder was another substitute.

559
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:27,400
 - Amazing, considering a time of extreme rationing

560
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:29,600
 and deprivation that people just have a vat

561
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:32,160
 of gravy like around solely for their legs.

562
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,240
 (all laughing)

563
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:34,840
 - Well, they had the priority straight.

564
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:36,120
 - I don't know, in those days,

565
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:38,560
 you probably would have to reuse the gravy, no?

566
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:40,160
 - I'm sure you would, yeah.

567
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,000
 - Yeah.

568
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:41,840
 - It's such a, I mean, it's just,

569
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:43,280
 it's makeup for the legs, isn't it?

570
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:44,120
 - Yeah, yeah.

571
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:44,960
 - I'm not strong with that.

572
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:45,800
 - Nothing wrong with it, no.

573
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:47,880
 - Makeup is just drawing another face on your face.

574
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:49,440
 - So why not draw another leg on your leg?

575
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:50,280
 - Exactly.

576
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:51,600
 (all laughing)

577
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:52,440
 It's brilliant.

578
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:54,480
 It's because people were obsessed with nylon.

579
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,760
 I mean, it was so bizarre that nylon craze,

580
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:59,320
 because basically, I think it was invented in about 35

581
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:02,400
 and it owned or 34 and it only became commercially available

582
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,280
 in 37 or 38.

583
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:07,520
 And by the time the war hit, people were obsessed with it

584
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:09,360
 to the extent that as soon as it started being rationed

585
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:11,680
 'cause it was needed for various wartime instruments,

586
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:13,160
 they went nuts and they were desperate

587
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:14,600
 to show that they still sort of had nylon.

588
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:16,320
 There was this big black market

589
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,080
 where nylon went for sort of the equivalent

590
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:21,320
 of about $500 today, you'd get a pair of nylon tights.

591
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:22,160
 - For just one.

592
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,160
 - Yeah, yeah.

593
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:25,520
 Did they get people like trying to steal your tights off you

594
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:27,920
 'cause they're so expensive, like an iPhone?

595
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:29,760
 - Oh, probably, if it's so hard to steal tights

596
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:32,040
 'cause they aren't quite well adhered to the legs, aren't they?

597
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:33,760
 - And you could be pulling them, pulling it, turns out.

598
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,560
 It's just gravy good things.

599
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:37,160
 (all laughing)

600
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:39,400
 But I think it's quite harsh 'cause let you say,

601
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:40,160
 everyone loved them.

602
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:42,680
 It was like the most amazing thing of its day.

603
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:45,920
 And let you say, everyone got it for a few years

604
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:47,560
 and then it was taken away 'cause of the war.

605
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:49,760
 It's like, as if we all had iPhones

606
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:51,280
 and then they go after three years,

607
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:52,720
 you can't have iPhones anymore.

608
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,040
 That would be harsh.

609
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:54,880
 - I would.

610
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,320
 - The world might be a better place.

611
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,320
 (all laughing)

612
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:59,920
 - The first day of sales, nationally in America,

613
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:02,120
 was the 16th of May, 1940.

614
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:03,720
 So the rest of the world was at war.

615
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:05,320
 America hadn't quite decided yet.

616
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:08,840
 And the statistics vary, but some people say

617
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:11,720
 that four million pairs were sold in four days.

618
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:13,840
 That was true, mania.

619
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:16,000
 But this is a bit like, telly, I think.

620
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,760
 Didn't Britain just get TV?

621
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:19,040
 And then the war happened and they said,

622
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:22,200
 well, we're not gonna do TV anymore for the next six years.

623
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:25,120
 And then it started again in the late '40s or early '50s.

624
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:27,160
 There's a lot of those inventions which have been existing,

625
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:29,240
 but it was just back burner for the war.

626
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:31,600
 - And then post war, when they were available again,

627
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,480
 there were nylon riots.

628
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:35,560
 It was, 'cause they didn't have enough stock

629
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:36,920
 for the amount of people who wanted

630
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:37,760
 and were obsessed with them,

631
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,560
 and been waiting for them to come back.

632
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:43,320
 So in Pittsburgh, they had 40,000 people lining up

633
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:47,040
 over a mile, even though there was only 13,000 pairs available.

634
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:50,560
 So you can imagine the chaos when those shops opened the doors.

635
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:51,800
 - Yeah, there used to be, you know,

636
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:54,480
 police would have to be deployed quite a lot, I think.

637
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,280
 This was sort of '45 and '46.

638
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:59,200
 There was, I think, do pont the main company

639
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,640
 that made the tights or the stockings.

640
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:03,720
 They said they would make 360 million pairs

641
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,280
 as soon as the war ended within a year.

642
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:07,240
 And they could not live up to that at all.

643
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:09,080
 People went nuts, got really excited.

644
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:11,640
 So there was, yeah, there's 16 block queue

645
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:12,840
 where people started fighting.

646
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:14,440
 In Georgia, there were fist fights

647
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:16,920
 and police had to be called to break them up.

648
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:20,080
 There was a mob in Chicago of 1,200 women

649
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:21,280
 who were outside a dress shop

650
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,840
 just bashing on the windows again.

651
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:24,200
 Police had to be called.

652
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,040
 They went mad.

653
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:26,080
 They went hysterical.

654
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:28,240
 I don't want to, you know, be stereotyping here,

655
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:30,080
 but they lost their shit, though.

656
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:32,280
 (laughing)

657
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:34,560
 - People were scared of nylon,

658
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:36,920
 because partly because it had this weird process

659
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:39,200
 by which it was made, it was sort of acid and stuff.

660
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,120
 And partly because there was just this huge Ferrari

661
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:42,520
 about it, so there's a backlash.

662
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:45,000
 And all these rumors went around about what it could do,

663
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,640
 so people thought it would give you cancer of the legs.

664
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:50,360
 They thought it mounted in hot water.

665
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:52,600
 I don't know why it'd go in hot water wearing tights,

666
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:54,600
 but it was that.

667
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:56,800
 They feel like snakes when wet.

668
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:57,640
 (laughing)

669
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:59,640
 - The same thing reported.

670
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:01,200
 People thought they were made from corpses

671
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,960
 because there was a thing called cadaverine,

672
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,360
 which was gathered from course up

673
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:06,120
 and it's gathered from corpses to make stuff,

674
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:06,960
 but they weren't.

675
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,120
 It was a rumor.

676
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:09,760
 - Wait, so cadaverine didn't exist?

677
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:11,960
 - I think cadaverine, I think it did exist.

678
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:14,240
 It was a chemical that you could get from rotting cadavers

679
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:15,240
 that comes from rotting cadavers.

680
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:16,720
 - I think that's the word that people used

681
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:19,360
 for just like human snarge, basically.

682
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:20,680
 - Human snarge, right.

683
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:23,600
 - The thing is with this is it was a very smelly process.

684
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,320
 Like the industrial process was really smelly,

685
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:27,120
 so when journalists went there,

686
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:28,760
 they smelled how bad it was.

687
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:31,600
 And I think actually one newspaper did say

688
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,680
 that this happened in a newspaper article

689
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:35,800
 and everyone believed it when obviously it wasn't true.

690
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:36,640
 - Oh, yeah.

691
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,240
 - That's great.

692
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:40,480
 - And there was, I think there was one other report

693
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:43,440
 in a paper of a woman who was standing at a bus stop

694
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:46,560
 and the bus went past and the exhaust fumes

695
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:49,520
 of the bus stripped the nylon off her legs completely.

696
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:51,560
 I know all these rumors that the nylon would just fall

697
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:52,400
 off your legs.

698
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:53,400
 - It's like a belly hilt.

699
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:57,760
 - I think with people thought they might burn,

700
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:58,600
 did you say?

701
00:22:58,600 --> 00:22:59,440
 - Yeah, melt.

702
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:01,760
 - I think so because you've got this basically a plastic

703
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:02,600
 as it is polymer.

704
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:03,440
 - Yeah.

705
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:05,040
 - So it makes sense that it would just melt on to you.

706
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:06,040
 - It actually could a bit.

707
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:08,480
 If it was too humid, the air would too damp,

708
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:10,320
 then it could start melting down your legs.

709
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:11,160
 - Really?

710
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:16,000
 - There is a problem with nylon and health today,

711
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,760
 which is nylon teabags.

712
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:20,760
 So they started coming in about 12 or 13 years ago

713
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:22,840
 and I've found articles from a time saying,

714
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:24,080
 hey, great new nylon teabags,

715
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:25,680
 number of these boring paper teabags.

716
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:28,360
 And you know, they're silky and they feel nice

717
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:32,080
 and it turns out they're plastic, obviously.

718
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:32,920
 - Plastic's bad for you.

719
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:33,760
 - Plastic's bad.

720
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:36,320
 So is that the most of the ones that I would get down

721
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:37,680
 the shop so they like that?

722
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:38,840
 - You are not real.

723
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:43,320
 - So a normal packet of a normal packet of teabaget,

724
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:46,440
 I think those are all paper except sometimes they're sealed

725
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:48,160
 with a tiny, tiny blob of granite.

726
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:50,840
 But the some coffee shops sell them in

727
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:52,160
 and they look kind of weird and different.

728
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:53,000
 - You mean the posh ones?

729
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:53,840
 - The posh ones?

730
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:54,680
 - The posh ones.

731
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:55,520
 - Yeah.

732
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:56,360
 - There's posh and it feels like a bit like silk.

733
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:57,760
 - Well, really posh ones are made of silk.

734
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,280
 (laughing)

735
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:00,120
 - Wow.

736
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:03,160
 - But if you don't, if you can't run to these patee,

737
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:04,600
 if you can't run to a silk.

738
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:06,360
 - Back, someone will fobby off with a nylon one

739
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:07,960
 and they've been studied.

740
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:10,760
 So every single silky plasticity teabag

741
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:13,920
 releases 11.6 billion microplastics.

742
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:14,920
 These are very, very, very small.

743
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:15,760
 - Jesus.

744
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:18,440
 - And three billion nano plastics.

745
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:20,960
 And those are extremely tiny, they're smaller.

746
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:23,360
 Yeah, but they are, they are bad.

747
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:26,240
 So the scientists tried feeding them to water fleas,

748
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:29,240
 which are little tiny lobster animals

749
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:31,160
 and they became very stressed

750
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:34,040
 and the exoskeleton swelled up.

751
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:35,760
 So it wasn't good for them.

752
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:36,600
 - So, yeah.

753
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:37,880
 - But it means that what you're saying is

754
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:41,200
 in your cup of tea of posh, but not that posh tea,

755
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,640
 then you're getting it into your body.

756
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:45,880
 And basically, I mean, they're gonna find this

757
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:46,720
 in years to come out.

758
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,600
 It's gonna be, you know, when the Romans

759
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:52,160
 had lead in the pipes, and they all went crazy.

760
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:54,320
 And everyone knew it was 'cause of the lead in the pipes.

761
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:57,000
 That's what it's gonna be, we're just eating plastic all the time.

762
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,040
 - On the bristles on toothbrushes, plastic is,

763
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:02,440
 I mean, they're nylon as well.

764
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:04,000
 - Do you think this is gonna be the explanation

765
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,160
 of the person of Brexit and Donald Trump and all of that?

766
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:08,240
 It's actually just, like, you know how we've discovered

767
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,040
 the Salem Witch Crisis was,

768
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:12,960
 people say it's caused by the ergo from the dodgy bread.

769
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:16,520
 It's gonna be that we were just eating microplastics.

770
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:17,520
 - That's it.

771
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:20,000
 - Okay, I'm so glad about that because I hate those tea bags.

772
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,640
 They make awful tea.

773
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:23,160
 - I don't think they're very permeable.

774
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:24,200
 - They're not permeable enough.

775
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,400
 That's exactly correct.

776
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:27,280
 So the pretentious places serve them,

777
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:28,800
 and you don't even taste any tea.

778
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:30,760
 - I read an article that said that they're,

779
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:32,920
 when they were trying to come up with the name for nylon,

780
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:36,800
 there were over 400 options for what they wanted to go for.

781
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:38,520
 Yeah, and there's a few that we know of.

782
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:43,280
 So one was CLIS, K-L-I-S, which is silk backwards,

783
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:44,720
 because this was, yeah, an awkward product.

784
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:45,800
 - It was like, instead of silk,

785
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:47,120
 crossing it, that's why it was so big.

786
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:49,600
 - Exactly, yeah, this was like the cheap replacement,

787
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:50,600
 the affordable replacement.

788
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:54,360
 Neuron was one, which is actually no run.

789
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:57,240
 - No run. - 'Cause the tights, so run.

790
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:59,400
 And then there was Duporor.

791
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:03,320
 And it's a shame it wasn't called that, Duporor.

792
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:05,240
 D-U-P-A-R-W-H.

793
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:06,760
 - I think it's more like Duporoo, you know.

794
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:08,000
 - Oh, Duporoo. - Yeah.

795
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,640
 - Duporoo, like Winnie the Pooh, Duporoo.

796
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:10,480
 - Okay, cool.

797
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:11,320
 Yeah, sorry.

798
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:12,640
 - Duporoo. - Duporoo, super Duporoo.

799
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:13,640
 - Super Duporoo. - Yeah.

800
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:15,200
 - Okay, so that was an acronym.

801
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:18,440
 It stood for Dupont, pulls a rabbit out of a hat.

802
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:19,280
 - Yes.

803
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:20,200
 - And Dupont was the manufacturer.

804
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:21,680
 - Yeah. - Right, yeah, yeah.

805
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:25,040
 - We should say why they banded.

806
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:28,840
 'Cause the reason, the reason it was so amazing

807
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:31,680
 was that it was another material

808
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:33,360
 which replaced silk, basically.

809
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:35,240
 And before the war, America imported,

810
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:38,800
 I think it was 80% of all the silk made in the world

811
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:41,440
 was imported, and 90% of that was from Japan.

812
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:43,840
 So obviously, when the USA and Japan were a war,

813
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:44,680
 big problem.

814
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:47,000
 And nylon was this incredible wonder substance,

815
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:50,240
 which really contributed to the USA winning the war,

816
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:53,520
 because it made better parachutes than silk parachutes.

817
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:55,640
 Silk parachutes got moldy, the heart of fold.

818
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:59,800
 Nylons went better, and it was used for ropes and fuel tanks

819
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:01,920
 and shoelaces and mosquito nets and hammers.

820
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,760
 Just anything you could think of in the field

821
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:05,000
 that was fabriky.

822
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,320
 Nylon was the thing, you know.

823
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:09,280
 - Yeah, when we were told to hand in their tights,

824
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:10,120
 weren't they?

825
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:12,080
 It was sort of a patriotic war effort.

826
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:15,600
 - Can you turn tights back into, let's say a fuel tank?

827
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:16,440
 - Yeah, I believe they could,

828
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:19,840
 because they weren't asked to do an amnesty.

829
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:22,800
 And I think that one of the slogans was a Boeing super fortress

830
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:26,040
 that lands on enough nylon to make 4,000 pairs of stockings.

831
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:27,880
 So that's that it made the tires.

832
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:30,120
 But they did ask people to hand in their stockings, so.

833
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:32,560
 - I think you could turn it into a rope quite easily.

834
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:33,560
 - Yeah, try it.

835
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:35,640
 Or if you're in the USA as you could pull it over your head

836
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:36,760
 for the disguise.

837
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:37,760
 - Yeah, that's good.

838
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:38,600
 - That's good.

839
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:40,040
 - Cut a pair of my hulls.

840
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:41,040
 - Yeah.

841
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:44,160
 - Or if you're marching into Paris, saving Paris,

842
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:46,240
 you could go into skies in the Mulan Rouge.

843
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:47,760
 (laughing)

844
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:49,720
 - A lot of callbacks to the free of your service.

845
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:53,040
 - It's obvious as if I literally just edited it.

846
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:55,760
 - James is trying to turn this into a long-running storyline.

847
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:56,600
 A lot of five years.

848
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:59,120
 We need some cut lines, imagine.

849
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:00,160
 - We need a narrative.

850
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:01,000
 - Yeah.

851
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,600
 (upbeat music)

852
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:09,280
 - Okay, it is time for fact number three.

853
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:11,560
 And that is Chisinski.

854
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:15,000
 - My fact this week is that more than 80% of Japan's temples

855
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,440
 have suffered from raccoon damage.

856
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:21,400
 And it's really sad because raccoons are not even native

857
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:23,840
 to Japan, obviously, but they've swarmed there

858
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:24,800
 the last few years.

859
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:27,360
 And they're one of the main causes of damage to the temples.

860
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:29,560
 So the advice to anyone out there

861
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:32,360
 who's thinking about getting a raccoon for a pet is don't.

862
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:35,440
 They will eat anything and they cause damage

863
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:36,680
 to anywhere they are.

864
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:39,880
 So in Japan, they've just climbed all around the temples

865
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:42,720
 and they wanna find a nice little cozy nook to sleep in.

866
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:45,480
 And they'll tear and eat and scratch through anything

867
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:46,840
 that stands in their way.

868
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:48,720
 - Is it because people have got them as pets

869
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,000
 and then let them go or?

870
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,120
 - It is indeed.

871
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:55,560
 So it's this weird story where there was a very, very popular show

872
00:28:55,560 --> 00:29:00,200
 in the '70s, in 1977 called "Rascal the Racoon."

873
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:03,560
 And it was an animation, it was like an anime thing.

874
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:05,600
 And people thought, "Oh, I wanna get a pet raccoon."

875
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:08,120
 They obviously got the pets before they watched the end

876
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:10,560
 'cause the moral of the show and the book it's based on

877
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:12,880
 is that raccoons are terrible pets.

878
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:14,120
 You can't take care of them.

879
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:16,480
 And at the end, they had to release it back into the wild.

880
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:17,720
 Anyway, people bought all these.

881
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:19,560
 I think people were buying like 2000,

882
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:21,480
 a year of being imported into Japan.

883
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:23,480
 And then they started eating people's houses.

884
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:24,680
 And so they released them.

885
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:26,120
 - And they banned the imports, didn't they?

886
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:27,560
 - Yeah, yeah, you can't do that.

887
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:28,960
 - I read one source that said

888
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:32,040
 they were importing 1,500 a month.

889
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:33,040
 - Wow. - Wow.

890
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:33,880
 - Jesus.

891
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:34,720
 - Jesus. - It would be amazing.

892
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:36,120
 - There's too many raccoons.

893
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:36,960
 - It's too many.

894
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:39,360
 I mean, if you're a country which doesn't have any raccoons,

895
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:40,360
 then one is too many.

896
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:41,800
 - You're right, you're absolutely right.

897
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:45,920
 - And the author of this book is Sterling North.

898
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:47,360
 Great name, Sterling North.

899
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:48,680
 It's like lofty England.

900
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:53,920
 He passed away a few years before this animation hit Japan.

901
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:57,320
 So he never got to see the true sort of success

902
00:29:57,320 --> 00:30:00,600
 of his, he populated a country with an animal, basically.

903
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:02,520
 - Yeah, but we're saying it's not really a success.

904
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:03,840
 It's not a success story.

905
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:05,680
 - It is if you're a raccoon.

906
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:06,840
 And you want to travel.

907
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:08,400
 - It's a huge win for raccoons.

908
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:10,000
 And we know that Sterling North was interested

909
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,240
 in raccoons success.

910
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:15,360
 - Yeah, we don't know what you felt about Japan doing.

911
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:16,200
 - No.

912
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:20,320
 - Because America's the only place where they're native.

913
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:22,760
 But they've sort of invaded Germany as well now

914
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:23,600
 in Europe.

915
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:25,280
 - They haven't invaded, it's not like.

916
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:26,120
 - Yeah.

917
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:27,560
 - Well, I don't know because the European press

918
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:29,360
 called them Nazi raccoons.

919
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:30,200
 - Did they?

920
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:31,040
 - Yeah.

921
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:34,680
 If you look at any article in the last 10, 15 years

922
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:37,520
 from some of the more salacious press, I must say,

923
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:40,560
 they'll say, "Nazi raccoons coming to the Netherlands

924
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:43,280
 on Nazi raccoons coming to France or something."

925
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:45,480
 And that's because there was a theory

926
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:47,960
 that the first ones were let into the wild

927
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:49,320
 by Herman Goering.

928
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:52,280
 This is a massive rumor.

929
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:54,040
 And apparently he didn't do it.

930
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:58,240
 They were let into the wild in Germany in 1934

931
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:00,880
 to promote diversity of fauna.

932
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:02,920
 But Goering had nothing to do with it.

933
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:04,200
 But the rumor has persisted.

934
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:06,960
 And so we get all these articles saying Nazi raccoons.

935
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:09,560
 - Well, at least we stand that rumor out today.

936
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:12,400
 (all laughing)

937
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:16,080
 - In America, I don't know if they were kept as pets

938
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:18,080
 because I guess they should be in the wild

939
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:19,120
 hence the moral of the book.

940
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:21,320
 But one person who did keep of raccoon as a pet

941
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:23,600
 was the president of the United States

942
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:25,920
 in the White House, Calvin College.

943
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:26,760
 - Good day.

944
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:28,560
 - Yeah, he had a raccoon called Rebecca.

945
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:30,640
 And Rebecca was meant to be eaten

946
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:32,800
 as part of a Thanksgiving dinner.

947
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:35,480
 But he kind of just took to Rebecca instead.

948
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:37,360
 - Did they used to eat that instead of turkey?

949
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:38,200
 - Apparently.

950
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:39,040
 - Did they?

951
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:40,160
 - Well, they didn't.

952
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:41,960
 It came from, was it Mississippi?

953
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:43,760
 - I think sent him the raccoon.

954
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:46,160
 And I think Calvin looked at it and when,

955
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:48,160
 and someone said, it is edible mate.

956
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:49,800
 And he said, it's not edible to me.

957
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:51,440
 Take that away from you.

958
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:54,000
 'Cause you know, it was claimed he was doing the decent thing.

959
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,680
 And yeah, then they sort of laughed at it, didn't they?

960
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:58,480
 - Yeah, proper pet, like she had an engraved collar

961
00:31:58,480 --> 00:31:59,800
 that she got for Christmas.

962
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:01,280
 Yeah, she was a good pet.

963
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:03,240
 - Did you read that Christmas when they gave her

964
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:07,160
 the engraved collar, the present that they got their son

965
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:09,200
 was a coat made of raccoon fur?

966
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:11,200
 (all laughing)

967
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:13,480
 - That's a good warning to Rebecca to behave.

968
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:15,040
 - It's very good, isn't it?

969
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:16,600
 - But the collar from the raccoon was made

970
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:18,240
 from the rest bow and of that child.

971
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:20,840
 (all laughing)

972
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:25,440
 - They are really clever.

973
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:26,280
 That's the amazing thing.

974
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:28,160
 And I read an article saying that they,

975
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,320
 in the early 20th century,

976
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:31,560
 were used in a lot of lab experiments.

977
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:34,120
 And that they could have been lab rats, basically.

978
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:36,880
 Or they could have been the go-to for experimentation.

979
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:38,560
 But basically, they're too good.

980
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:39,600
 They're too clever.

981
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:41,680
 They escape, they chew through things.

982
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:43,520
 - They start performing experiments on us.

983
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:44,920
 (all laughing)

984
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:46,720
 - They get into the events and then,

985
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:48,800
 and just they were a nightmare.

986
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:51,840
 And it turns out that rats are a bit easier to control.

987
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:53,200
 - Yeah. - Yeah.

988
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:54,880
 - They're not hanging out with humans, don't they?

989
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:57,240
 They're one of the species that has really thrived

990
00:32:57,240 --> 00:33:00,200
 from human, you know, building up urban environments.

991
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:01,840
 They work very well in cities.

992
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:04,160
 - They're like the American version of a fox,

993
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:05,000
 like an urban fox.

994
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,880
 - I think they are, I think they're sort of like a better

995
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:08,840
 version, like a grade up from foxes.

996
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:12,600
 - They've got bloody hands, although not opposable thumbs.

997
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:16,320
 The only thing we've got over them, one thing,

998
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:17,320
 is opposable thumbs.

999
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:19,520
 And this has actually proved quite crucial in the US.

1000
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:21,200
 Well, I'm sure there are lots of listeners

1001
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:23,880
 who have issues with raccoons breaking into your bins.

1002
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:26,720
 And so they're like constantly trying to upgrade bins

1003
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:28,880
 to make them inaccessible to raccoons.

1004
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:29,880
 But because they're so smart,

1005
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:32,080
 they keep on working out how to do it.

1006
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:34,080
 And then they have made one apparently,

1007
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:35,080
 which is clocked onto the fact

1008
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:36,600
 they don't have an opposable thumb.

1009
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:38,040
 So if you can do that.

1010
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:39,480
 - Is that in Toronto?

1011
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:40,520
 - I think it might be, yeah.

1012
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:44,000
 - Because Toronto spent $31 million

1013
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,880
 getting a good raccoon proof bin in 2015.

1014
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:49,800
 They were so frustrated and they were really hard.

1015
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:53,320
 And the city's mayor wrote, "We are ready, we are armed

1016
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:55,640
 "and we are motivated to show that we cannot be defeated

1017
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:56,640
 "by these critters."

1018
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:57,800
 (laughing)

1019
00:33:57,800 --> 00:33:59,400
 As they were being rolled out across the city,

1020
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:02,040
 he tweeted, "I love the smell of new raccoon-resistant

1021
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:03,880
 "green bins in the morning."

1022
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:07,360
 And within a few days, raccoons had managed

1023
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:09,720
 to make their way into a few of these samples.

1024
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:10,560
 - And beaten him.

1025
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:13,160
 (laughing)

1026
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:14,560
 - There's actually an argument, I think,

1027
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:17,040
 that it's quite bad that we keep on trying to upgrade

1028
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:19,560
 these bins because we're just making them cleverer now.

1029
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:21,960
 We're in this terrible arms race with raccoons

1030
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:24,840
 where the more we complexify the bins,

1031
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:25,680
 the better they're getting--

1032
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:26,680
 - I know what you're saying,

1033
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:28,720
 but then actually we're getting better as well.

1034
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:30,720
 So actually by them forcing us to get better,

1035
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:32,040
 we're getting smarter.

1036
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:33,320
 The raccoons are getting smarter.

1037
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:35,840
 It's the rest of the animal kingdoms that are losing it.

1038
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:37,120
 (laughing)

1039
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:38,920
 Eventually it'll just be a massive battle

1040
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:41,200
 between us and the raccoons with raccoons on it.

1041
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:43,240
 (laughing)

1042
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:46,000
 You were saying about how lots of towns really don't like them.

1043
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,800
 There's an online factoid that says,

1044
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:50,280
 "If you take a raccoon head to the town hall

1045
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:53,560
 "of a town called Hanukkah, they'll give you $10."

1046
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:55,040
 And it says that all over the internet.

1047
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:55,880
 - Yeah.

1048
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:57,560
 - But when I read it, I emailed them,

1049
00:34:57,560 --> 00:34:59,640
 and they said, "No, this is absolute rubbish."

1050
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:01,120
 (laughing)

1051
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:02,960
 So if you do have a raccoon head,

1052
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:04,720
 don't bother taking it to the town hall of Hanukkah.

1053
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:05,560
 - That's good.

1054
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:06,800
 I think we're doing a real public service.

1055
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:09,280
 We've prevented people from decapitating raccoons.

1056
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:11,320
 - Although, actually, with the battle that's coming up,

1057
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:13,480
 we need to decapitate as much as possible.

1058
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:14,320
 (laughing)

1059
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:15,160
 That's so right.

1060
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:18,480
 (upbeat music)

1061
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:20,840
 - Okay, it's time for our final fact of the show,

1062
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:22,600
 and that is Andy.

1063
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:25,680
 - My fact is that the economist, John Maynard Keens,

1064
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:28,560
 once bought a priceless sizzan painting,

1065
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:30,520
 and then hid it in a hedge.

1066
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:31,720
 (laughing)

1067
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:32,560
 - Very good.

1068
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:33,720
 - Yeah.

1069
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:35,840
 - Why did he hide it?

1070
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:38,360
 - Well, it was a hedge fund, wasn't it?

1071
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:39,200
 - Brilliant.

1072
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:40,040
 - You see.

1073
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:41,240
 - He sees an economist, you see.

1074
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:43,280
 - The end of that section.

1075
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:44,440
 (laughing)

1076
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:46,920
 - So this is a fact from a podcast

1077
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:48,560
 that's coming out very shortly, actually,

1078
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:50,920
 and it's by friend of the show,

1079
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:52,840
 or a few of us know him, Tim Halford,

1080
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:54,280
 who is the undercover economist,

1081
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:56,880
 and his new show is called "Cautionary Tales,"

1082
00:35:56,880 --> 00:36:00,240
 and it's all about sort of mishaps, basically.

1083
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:02,560
 Things that haven't gone to plan, fiasco's,

1084
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:05,960
 grade A mishaps, you know, this kind of stuff.

1085
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:09,240
 Oil tankers crashing, and I've seen a bit of it,

1086
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:11,040
 and it's gonna be an extremely good show.

1087
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:12,040
 - Oh, it sounds amazing.

1088
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:14,240
 I mean, it sounds like we're gonna be stealing a lot from it.

1089
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:15,440
 I mean, look at it, it hasn't even come out.

1090
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:16,840
 We're ready stealing from it.

1091
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:17,680
 - Borrowing.

1092
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:19,480
 - Borrowing, sorry, legally borrowing.

1093
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:21,680
 - Are we giving this fact back?

1094
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:22,520
 At the end?

1095
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:23,360
 (laughing)

1096
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:24,600
 - Yeah, yeah.

1097
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:26,200
 So anyway, Tim sent me this fact,

1098
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:29,440
 and it's about Keens or Keens.

1099
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:30,280
 - Keens to the right.

1100
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:31,960
 - There are people say Keens, but I've read Keens online,

1101
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:34,240
 so I've read Keens, but I think we should say Keens.

1102
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:35,080
 - All right.

1103
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:36,520
 - For the wise, no one's gonna know who would take it.

1104
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:37,520
 (laughing)

1105
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:40,760
 - And it was in 1918, the first world war was grinding on.

1106
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:42,440
 He was a bright young economist,

1107
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:46,920
 and he realized that France's economy was very weak too,

1108
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:48,320
 and Britain was going to need to collect

1109
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:50,400
 a massive amount of loan money.

1110
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:53,920
 And he wanted to buy up artistic masterpieces

1111
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:56,960
 on behalf of Britain, so then the British government

1112
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:59,200
 wouldn't need to collect quite as much loan money.

1113
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:01,560
 Britain would have a lot of new artworks, got it.

1114
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:04,080
 And also, he felt a bit embarrassed about working

1115
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:05,720
 for the war effort, 'cause he was quite a Bohemian,

1116
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:07,920
 he was quite a pacifist, and a lot of his friends

1117
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:10,920
 had kind of ditched him over his stance in the war.

1118
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:11,920
 - Oh.

1119
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:14,360
 - So, he got Charles Holmes, who was the director

1120
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:16,360
 of the National Gallery on-side,

1121
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:17,920
 and he found a huge art auction

1122
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:21,160
 that was happening in Paris, all of Degas' collection

1123
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:23,960
 was being sold, and they went to the auction.

1124
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:25,200
 Holmes had shaved his moustache,

1125
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:26,240
 so he wouldn't be recognized

1126
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:29,600
 as the director of the National Gallery just in case.

1127
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:30,920
 And the auction was really quiet,

1128
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:32,560
 'cause Paris was in the middle of being bombed

1129
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:34,800
 by Germany at the time of the auction,

1130
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,840
 so not many people turned up.

1131
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:40,280
 And Holmes bought over 20 masterwork paintings,

1132
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:42,400
 and they had a sort of blank check from the government,

1133
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:44,760
 they had 20,000 pounds, which is a huge amount,

1134
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:47,720
 and Keynes bought himself a seazan,

1135
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:49,200
 and they traveled back to England,

1136
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:50,880
 he'd been traveling for 24 hours,

1137
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:53,400
 and he was visiting his friends in their countryside home,

1138
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:55,400
 and he was so knackered that he'd just chuck the suitcase

1139
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:58,760
 in the hedge with his priceless seazan painting in it,

1140
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:00,040
 and he walked into the house and he said,

1141
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:02,280
 "There's a seazan in the hedge outside, if you wanna go and look."

1142
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:04,000
 - So I've been to this house, have you?

1143
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:09,000
 - Yeah, it's called Charleston, and it's in Sussex.

1144
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,160
 It's very near my in-laws.

1145
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:11,000
 I went to it recently.

1146
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,960
 It was part of the Bloomsbury group house.

1147
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:16,120
 It's so Virginia Woolf's sister is who lived there

1148
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:20,160
 with her artistic friend/lover and his lover.

1149
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:21,320
 It was a complicated situation.

1150
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:23,680
 And the house is amazing, it's full of incredible art,

1151
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:27,960
 like Walter Sickert's original stuff,

1152
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:30,640
 which I studied because if you remember,

1153
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:32,520
 there was a theory that he was Jack the Ripper,

1154
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:34,400
 according to Patricia Cornwall.

1155
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:36,200
 So I was looking close for clues.

1156
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:38,480
 - No, it's just normal paintings.

1157
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:39,960
 - Probably 'cause it's bullshit.

1158
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:41,600
 - Probably 'cause there's no tree through it,

1159
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:44,640
 didn't write "I did it" in any of the corners of the pictures.

1160
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:47,360
 - But no, yeah, so it's an amazing house.

1161
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:48,640
 I've probably passed the hedge.

1162
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:49,480
 - So cool.

1163
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:52,480
 - I'm still a bit confused about why he didn't just bring

1164
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:54,520
 the suitcase into the house and ask if he could leave it

1165
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:56,080
 in the entrance or something.

1166
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:57,960
 - Whenever you come back from holiday,

1167
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:59,600
 I got all the way to your front door,

1168
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:00,960
 I got, you know what, I can't be bothered

1169
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:02,320
 bringing the bag-based locks back,

1170
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:04,200
 I'm just gonna throw it in the hedge.

1171
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:06,440
 - It feels like there's something missing from the account

1172
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:08,640
 'cause it's all from him writing it in from his friends.

1173
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:10,400
 I think maybe part, it might have been

1174
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:12,240
 'cause he wanted to make an entrance

1175
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:13,880
 and say, "Hey, it's me."

1176
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:16,800
 And I've got a price this bit of art in the hedge.

1177
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:17,640
 It's not clear.

1178
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:18,680
 - You don't just all everyone in the house

1179
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:20,040
 would go, "Why have you been in the hedge, mate?"

1180
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:21,040
 - Yeah.

1181
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:22,120
 - And they were in the hedge.

1182
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:23,120
 - They rushed out.

1183
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:23,960
 - I bet they did.

1184
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:24,800
 - Of course it was.

1185
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:25,640
 - But he did.

1186
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:26,640
 - 'Cause they wanted to see it

1187
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:28,200
 and they gathered around it by moonlight.

1188
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:29,800
 And it was, it was quite nice.

1189
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:31,520
 The reason he had bought it was because

1190
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:34,440
 the National Gallery director had refused

1191
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:37,760
 'cause it was Sizzan, who I think was a post-impressionist,

1192
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:39,520
 and it was very avant-garde.

1193
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:41,080
 And it was too avant-garde

1194
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:42,840
 for the National Gallery to be buying.

1195
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:44,760
 And home, so I'm not gonna waste my money on this.

1196
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:46,520
 It's too edgy.

1197
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:49,720
 And Keens was a bit more out there and he said,

1198
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:50,840
 "I'll buy it."

1199
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:51,680
 - Well, yeah.

1200
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:54,080
 - He was out there for normal society,

1201
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:56,400
 but then he feels like he was the straight lace one

1202
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:59,480
 of the Bloom's preset, like he was bridging a gap.

1203
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:01,800
 I think, 'cause he, but I don't know,

1204
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:04,240
 he had such a central role in that set of people

1205
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:05,840
 who were just artists and creatives,

1206
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:07,920
 which you don't picture Keens being.

1207
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:10,880
 And so he was there with Wolf and Sack of the West

1208
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:12,080
 and Ian Forster.

1209
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:14,800
 And one thing that they were all very relaxed about

1210
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:16,120
 and I find this really interesting

1211
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:17,360
 that society was really relaxed about

1212
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:19,320
 was the fact that he was bisexual

1213
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:21,520
 and for the first years of his sexual life,

1214
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:24,360
 he was only had relationships with men.

1215
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:25,800
 And I find that so bizarre,

1216
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:28,000
 because he came immediately after Oscar Wilde,

1217
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,200
 who obviously, you know, we know what happened to him.

1218
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:32,200
 And then immediately before Alan Turing,

1219
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:34,880
 but there was obviously this relaxation

1220
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:36,360
 for this 30-year period.

1221
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:38,040
 And so he was really promiscuous

1222
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:41,800
 and he had this love triangle with Litton Strati,

1223
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:45,280
 who then became very jealous of him going out with someone else.

1224
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:47,280
 And it was Litton Strati who said things like,

1225
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:50,360
 his common sense is enough to freeze a volcano,

1226
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:52,120
 which you can really imagine.

1227
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:55,880
 And he said he hated how he treats his love affairs statistically,

1228
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:56,840
 which is kind of true.

1229
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:58,520
 He kept it to the other spreadsheet.

1230
00:40:58,520 --> 00:41:00,160
 He had no cell spreadsheet, didn't he?

1231
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:01,000
 He did.

1232
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,440
 He wrote, well, it may not have been full on spreadsheet,

1233
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:06,080
 but he used to record the numbers in his diary,

1234
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:09,040
 which, you know, if you were just a number in someone's diary,

1235
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:10,800
 well, I'd be quite proud.

1236
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:12,200
 It depends on the number, doesn't it?

1237
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:13,680
 I want to be registered.

1238
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:17,480
 If it's a scoreboard, then great.

1239
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:18,480
 They were high numbers.

1240
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:20,760
 Yeah, didn't he have lots of codes or something

1241
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:22,840
 for everything that they did?

1242
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:24,280
 I haven't gotten this written down,

1243
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:28,440
 but I think he would have sex with someone

1244
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:31,120
 and then he would have, like, AS for anal sex,

1245
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:33,560
 or, you know, different things for different things.

1246
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:37,640
 And then I think he would give people by their initials,

1247
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:39,920
 but then if it was just a dalliance,

1248
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:42,960
 it would be bloke in a hedge or, you know,

1249
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:44,280
 whatever, it's like something.

1250
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:45,000
 Look at hedge.

1251
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,120
 I apologize about throwing my suitcase onto him.

1252
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:51,160
 But I think it was that it was, like, there would be no names.

1253
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:53,920
 It would just be this person in this situation.

1254
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:55,720
 Yeah, I'd be like, "Bell boy."

1255
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:58,200
 Yeah, you had the suite of the National Gallery,

1256
00:41:58,200 --> 00:42:01,000
 the soldier of the baths, the French conscript,

1257
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,680
 the lift boy at Voxel.

1258
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:04,520
 Really?

1259
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:05,440
 Lift boy at Voxel.

1260
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:05,960
 Wow.

1261
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:07,960
 And still no blue plaque at Voxel.

1262
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:10,160
 Outrageous.

1263
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:12,600
 He also revolutionized economics.

1264
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:13,400
 Wow.

1265
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:16,280
 Which, it's incredible.

1266
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:19,320
 And he, so he had only studied economics

1267
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:23,360
 for eight weeks during his student days.

1268
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:24,480
 He never sat an examiner.

1269
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:26,560
 He studied classics and maths.

1270
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:28,760
 And then he only started properly going into it

1271
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:32,360
 when he was offered a lectureship in economics age 25.

1272
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:35,440
 And then he just turned up and started revolutionizing the art.

1273
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:39,320
 And then he almost went bankrupt three times in his life,

1274
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:42,160
 despite being one of the greatest economists of history.

1275
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:43,960
 Hey, it was the great depression.

1276
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:44,960
 That was one of them.

1277
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:46,440
 You can't blame him for that.

1278
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:48,000
 But what about the other two, I didn't know.

1279
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:52,000
 So the first one was when England went to the Golden Standard

1280
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,440
 as in peg the pound with the gold.

1281
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:56,200
 And he gambled against that happening

1282
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:57,880
 and lost shit ton of money.

1283
00:42:57,880 --> 00:43:01,040
 And then he speculated against the war.

1284
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:02,560
 He didn't think the war would happen.

1285
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:04,440
 And he lost a shit ton of money on that.

1286
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:07,520
 And then the great depression, which I think we can understand.

1287
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:09,520
 Actually, I mean all of it, we can kind of understand.

1288
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:11,040
 But gosh.

1289
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:12,400
 My gamble.

1290
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:13,560
 Yeah, he's a gambler.

1291
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:18,880
 But he got one thing really right, which was about the Treaty of Versailles.

1292
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:22,320
 So he was present in Versailles as the representative

1293
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:24,640
 for the treasury, financial rep.

1294
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:28,840
 And in 1919, he was arguing these compensation payments

1295
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:30,080
 that you're suggesting Germany makes.

1296
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:31,680
 They are too high.

1297
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:33,960
 And this is an insane impulse.

1298
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:36,760
 And it will lead to disaster in the long run.

1299
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:38,440
 And he was ignored.

1300
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:40,160
 He was kind of kept out of the room, actually.

1301
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:42,080
 And so he was left to try and, you know,

1302
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:44,240
 he and a couple of other reps were advising around the edges

1303
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:46,200
 saying this may not work.

1304
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:48,600
 And he failed, basically, because the impulse to punish Germany

1305
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:49,400
 was very strong.

1306
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:50,560
 But he was proved right.

1307
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:51,680
 Him and Churchill.

1308
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:53,360
 I feel like Churchill said the same things.

1309
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:56,440
 They were just outside the room, bitching about a stupid Versailles.

1310
00:43:56,440 --> 00:43:57,120
 Wow.

1311
00:43:57,120 --> 00:43:59,200
 But they were laughing in their faces.

1312
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:00,280
 20 years later.

1313
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:02,120
 One thing that he didn't get right was he said,

1314
00:44:02,120 --> 00:44:04,000
 oh, I don't think he's going to get right.

1315
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:07,440
 As he said, that by 2030, everyone in the Western world

1316
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:10,920
 will be working a 15-hour work week.

1317
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:12,000
 Now, this is prediction.

1318
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:16,280
 If things go really badly wrong, we might be.

1319
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:19,040
 He thought that only worker-holics would be working more than that.

1320
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:21,480
 And everyone else progression would get so much

1321
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:22,840
 that you could do that amount of work

1322
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:24,640
 and you'd get paid enough that the rest of your time

1323
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:25,800
 you could be at leisure.

1324
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:26,920
 Because basically, technology would have

1325
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:28,760
 been able to do stuff for us.

1326
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:29,800
 That was his idea, yeah.

1327
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:32,120
 But why he didn't realize is that as technology goes up,

1328
00:44:32,120 --> 00:44:36,040
 so does the number of people who have to work at that technology.

1329
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:38,280
 How do robots actually just make more work for us?

1330
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:38,800
 They do.

1331
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:39,520
 They do.

1332
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:40,680
 People don't realize that.

1333
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:42,160
 Not supposed to happen.

1334
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:44,120
 But he did think that a very sensible thing,

1335
00:44:44,120 --> 00:44:47,840
 which was that the obsession with money that society has is insane.

1336
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:50,640
 He thought it was like this crazy social pathology.

1337
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:52,000
 Because why do you want money?

1338
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:53,280
 What you want is leisure.

1339
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:54,840
 What makes humans happy is leisure time.

1340
00:44:54,840 --> 00:44:56,720
 And so he thought, well, we should all be striving towards

1341
00:44:56,720 --> 00:44:59,600
 is that three hours work a day.

1342
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:01,240
 Then it sounds like a good idea.

1343
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:02,160
 Does fingers crossed?

1344
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:06,120
 2030 is still 10 years away, guys.

1345
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:08,960
 He had this weird thing, just to go about his personal life.

1346
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:10,160
 Now we've covered the economics.

1347
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:13,920
 So he had a really lovely marriage, as far as I can tell.

1348
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:17,880
 He married a ballerina called Lydia Lopperkova, or Lopokava.

1349
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:19,480
 But he was very confused by this.

1350
00:45:19,480 --> 00:45:21,040
 First, he started falling in love with women

1351
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:22,400
 and became a bit confused by that.

1352
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:24,160
 The first woman he fell in love with, he said,

1353
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:26,200
 "I seem to have fallen in love with Ray a little bit,

1354
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:28,240
 but as she isn't male, I haven't been able to think

1355
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:30,760
 of any suitable steps to take."

1356
00:45:30,760 --> 00:45:32,480
 Asked a man in hedge for his opinion.

1357
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:33,320
 He is also stumped.

1358
00:45:33,320 --> 00:45:37,200
 Wow.

1359
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:39,840
 He married this ballerina eventually.

1360
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:44,000
 And he took her on honeymoon to, I think it was Sussex,

1361
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,200
 but he had this honeymoon where he invited some other people.

1362
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:47,960
 And one of the people he invited was

1363
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:50,720
 Vickenstein, the philosopher of Vickenstein,

1364
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:53,320
 who was not that much a laugh to have a honeymoon with him.

1365
00:45:53,320 --> 00:45:57,640
 He sounds really unpleasant.

1366
00:45:57,640 --> 00:46:00,560
 Apparently, he spent the whole six days making her feel like shit.

1367
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:04,120
 She was a bit lower social class, maybe wasn't intellectual.

1368
00:46:04,120 --> 00:46:06,920
 Yeah, making her feel really stupid.

1369
00:46:06,920 --> 00:46:08,960
 And eventually, she apparently made a remark

1370
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:10,720
 about how beautiful a tree was.

1371
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:12,960
 And he said, "What do you mean by that?

1372
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:15,080
 Challenging her to explain herself."

1373
00:46:15,080 --> 00:46:16,120
 And she just burst into tears.

1374
00:46:16,120 --> 00:46:16,920
 Wow. Wow.

1375
00:46:16,920 --> 00:46:17,920
 And that's what he can't.

1376
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:24,120
 When Keen's first saw his future wife at the ballet I read,

1377
00:46:24,120 --> 00:46:27,600
 he described her as a rotten dancer with a stiff bottom.

1378
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:30,920
 It's not very nice, is it?

1379
00:46:30,920 --> 00:46:31,520
 It's not very nice.

1380
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:32,800
 Although, actually, a stiff bottom.

1381
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:35,080
 I don't know, that could be nice thing, the stiff bottom.

1382
00:46:35,080 --> 00:46:35,920
 Yeah.

1383
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:38,040
 Is that so often not when paired with rotten dancer?

1384
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:38,880
 Oh.

1385
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:45,880
 I have a couple of art things, just of hidden art.

1386
00:46:45,880 --> 00:46:51,200
 So a few years back, there was a guy who was watching a movie

1387
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:52,640
 with his daughter.

1388
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:55,360
 And in it, in the movie, I was watching was Stuart Little.

1389
00:46:55,360 --> 00:46:59,600
 And in the movie, in the background, he noticed this painting

1390
00:46:59,600 --> 00:47:03,960
 that looked suspiciously similar to a lost avant-garde painting

1391
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:05,160
 that was from Hungary.

1392
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:08,640
 So sorry, can I just say Stuart Little isn't animated, is it?

1393
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:11,280
 Stuart Little himself is animated, but the rest of it

1394
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:12,360
 has got Hugh Laurie.

1395
00:47:12,360 --> 00:47:13,840
 And it's, yeah.

1396
00:47:13,840 --> 00:47:15,680
 Yeah, so in the background of the house that Stuart

1397
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:16,800
 Lives in is this painting.

1398
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:18,960
 And he's going, I swear to God, I've seen that painting

1399
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:19,800
 from somewhere before.

1400
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:22,680
 And he had a little black and white picture of it.

1401
00:47:22,680 --> 00:47:23,880
 It was 90 years old.

1402
00:47:23,880 --> 00:47:25,640
 And it had been lost for nine decades.

1403
00:47:25,640 --> 00:47:27,400
 And he got in contact with the production.

1404
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:29,360
 And he said, do you still have this painting?

1405
00:47:29,360 --> 00:47:30,880
 It took two years for them to get back.

1406
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:34,120
 And eventually, the lady who was in charge of the dressing

1407
00:47:34,120 --> 00:47:36,400
 for the house said, yeah, I found it at some market.

1408
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:37,760
 I bought it for nothing.

1409
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:40,440
 And they've now established that this is the lost work

1410
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:43,160
 of an artist called Robert Burrani.

1411
00:47:43,160 --> 00:47:46,320
 It does two years to reply to an email.

1412
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:48,280
 It was a very successful film Stuart Little.

1413
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:50,960
 And they had a sequel to reply to it.

1414
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:52,200
 They had a sequel to make.

1415
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:54,120
 It makes me feel a lot better about my email.

1416
00:47:54,120 --> 00:47:58,120
 So that is the main takeaway for me as well.

1417
00:47:58,120 --> 00:48:00,320
 Yeah, crazy.

1418
00:48:00,320 --> 00:48:04,920
 There was another incident in 2008, where a Norman Rockwell painting,

1419
00:48:04,920 --> 00:48:06,680
 really famous for Norman Rockwell painting,

1420
00:48:06,680 --> 00:48:08,960
 was found hidden behind a false wall.

1421
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:12,000
 And this was, it was worth $15.4 million.

1422
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,520
 And the reason that had happened, it was this weird story.

1423
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:17,320
 So it was really famous because it had been on the cover

1424
00:48:17,320 --> 00:48:19,040
 of magazine in the '50s.

1425
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:23,360
 And it was bought by a cartoonist called Don Tract Junior.

1426
00:48:23,360 --> 00:48:26,280
 And he just bought it for $900 in 1960.

1427
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:29,720
 And he sort of displayed it people thought for years afterwards.

1428
00:48:29,720 --> 00:48:31,320
 People would come around and be like, oh yeah,

1429
00:48:31,320 --> 00:48:33,040
 Don's got that great picture.

1430
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:35,520
 And people were a bit confused because when they look closely

1431
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:39,080
 at the one he had, it didn't match up with the magazine cover.

1432
00:48:39,080 --> 00:48:40,200
 So a bit odd.

1433
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:43,840
 Anyway, he died a few years ago, 2008 or 2007.

1434
00:48:43,840 --> 00:48:45,960
 And his sons went through his home.

1435
00:48:45,960 --> 00:48:48,800
 They discovered an entire false wall they'd had built.

1436
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:51,280
 And behind it was the real painting.

1437
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:55,200
 And he'd painted a copy of that to show to the public.

1438
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:58,200
 And his son's theory about why he'd hidden the original

1439
00:48:58,200 --> 00:49:01,800
 is because he disliked his wife and he then divorced so much

1440
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:03,560
 that he was worried she would take it.

1441
00:49:03,560 --> 00:49:05,040
 Wow, how did it?

1442
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:07,760
 Oh my god, that's a lot to do, isn't it?

1443
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:09,800
 That is a lot, it's incredible.

1444
00:49:09,800 --> 00:49:14,040
 In '50s or '50s, Leonardo did a fresco.

1445
00:49:14,040 --> 00:49:16,920
 We're just first naming Leonardo, aren't we?

1446
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:20,560
 Oh, sorry, Leonardo DiCaprio.

1447
00:49:20,560 --> 00:49:22,880
 Leonardo da Vinci made this fresco.

1448
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:26,200
 And it was in the grand meeting hall of Florence's Palazzo

1449
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:27,840
 Betio, okay.

1450
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:30,440
 And then the Medici's came along and they decided,

1451
00:49:30,440 --> 00:49:33,200
 "I don't really like that, I want something else in that place."

1452
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:36,040
 So they commissioned the architect Giordio Vassari

1453
00:49:36,040 --> 00:49:39,280
 to renovate the room and to put something else in its place,

1454
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:41,360
 which means that we've lost that fresco.

1455
00:49:41,360 --> 00:49:44,880
 But we know that Vassari was a big fan of Leonardo.

1456
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:48,280
 And so we think that he probably wouldn't have destroyed it.

1457
00:49:48,280 --> 00:49:50,040
 And in that room, if you go there now,

1458
00:49:50,040 --> 00:49:52,360
 there are two words painted in the whole room.

1459
00:49:52,360 --> 00:49:56,920
 And they are "serts a trover," which means "seek and you shall find."

1460
00:49:56,920 --> 00:49:58,800
 And we know that at another time,

1461
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:01,880
 he has, in another time, put a fake wall in place

1462
00:50:01,880 --> 00:50:04,320
 to hide something that he didn't want to damage.

1463
00:50:04,320 --> 00:50:06,160
 So we think that somewhere in that room,

1464
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:09,040
 there might be Leonardo's lost fresco.

1465
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:10,280
 Wow.

1466
00:50:10,280 --> 00:50:11,680
 How hard is it to search a room?

1467
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:14,320
 Well, yeah, but I guess if he's got art on the wall,

1468
00:50:14,320 --> 00:50:15,120
 he's painted his own--

1469
00:50:15,120 --> 00:50:16,120
 He's painted his own fresco.

1470
00:50:16,120 --> 00:50:17,080
 He's got a good painting.

1471
00:50:17,080 --> 00:50:19,280
 Yeah, just tear it down.

1472
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:20,920
 Yeah, I guess Leonardo.

1473
00:50:20,920 --> 00:50:23,360
 Apparently, and I'm quoting this from the article I read it,

1474
00:50:23,360 --> 00:50:26,040
 it says, "Excavation has been tangled for years

1475
00:50:26,040 --> 00:50:29,240
 in the famously convoluted Italian bureaucracy."

1476
00:50:29,240 --> 00:50:31,360
 It's actually the people who worked on Stuart Little,

1477
00:50:31,360 --> 00:50:34,120
 who were in charge of this renovation.

1478
00:50:34,120 --> 00:50:35,640
 How many fake walls are going to help?

1479
00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:38,440
 These are going to be tiny rooms eventually.

1480
00:50:38,440 --> 00:50:39,440
 You're right.

1481
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:42,160
 I'm sure it used to be able to fit the dining room table in here.

1482
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:49,720
 I've got a fact about war art and art being hidden in times of war.

1483
00:50:49,720 --> 00:50:52,080
 So the second world war, I think we may have mentioned before

1484
00:50:52,080 --> 00:50:53,520
 that all the art in the National Gallery

1485
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:55,560
 was sent to a cave in Wales.

1486
00:50:55,560 --> 00:50:56,320
 Yeah.

1487
00:50:56,320 --> 00:51:00,320
 And by the end of the war, it was the most high-tech cave

1488
00:51:00,320 --> 00:51:02,960
 in the world, because they built a railway inside the cave

1489
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:04,040
 to move all the art around.

1490
00:51:04,040 --> 00:51:05,040
 It was cool.

1491
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:07,120
 And I really like how it got there.

1492
00:51:07,120 --> 00:51:09,440
 So the paintings were sent in post office vans

1493
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:13,520
 and Cadbury delivery tracks to avoid attracting attention to them.

1494
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:14,200
 Oh, wow.

1495
00:51:14,200 --> 00:51:16,680
 So I can't think of anything that would be attracted to bar

1496
00:51:16,680 --> 00:51:19,760
 and driving through my village in Wales.

1497
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:20,560
 And you're right.

1498
00:51:20,560 --> 00:51:23,040
 Well, suddenly hundreds of Cadbury delivery trucks are driving through.

1499
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:25,080
 In the war, when chocolate was rationed--

1500
00:51:25,080 --> 00:51:26,640
 Exactly.

1501
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:29,040
 But there's one painting, which gave them such problems.

1502
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:33,000
 So it's by Van Dyke, and it's a portrait of Charles I, right?

1503
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:34,240
 And it's a biggie.

1504
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:39,240
 It's 12 feet by 9 1/2 feet, and it's on a truck.

1505
00:51:39,240 --> 00:51:41,480
 So I presume that was wrapped up.

1506
00:51:41,480 --> 00:51:45,360
 But there was a very, very tight bend in the road

1507
00:51:45,360 --> 00:51:46,920
 just before they get to the thing.

1508
00:51:46,920 --> 00:51:48,840
 So there's no other way of getting there.

1509
00:51:48,840 --> 00:51:50,080
 Very tight bend in the road.

1510
00:51:50,080 --> 00:51:54,000
 And at that same point, there's a railway bridge over the road.

1511
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,640
 And they calculated it would be possible to do it.

1512
00:51:56,640 --> 00:51:59,720
 But you'd have to pivot really--

1513
00:51:59,720 --> 00:52:00,720
 Pivot?

1514
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:02,360
 Pivot really carefully.

1515
00:52:02,360 --> 00:52:04,120
 And they didn't want to take the risk.

1516
00:52:04,120 --> 00:52:07,040
 So the way they solved it was they took up

1517
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:09,400
 the surface of the road.

1518
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:11,040
 They just destroyed the surface of the road

1519
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:12,880
 to get several more inches of clearance.

1520
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:13,600
 Wow.

1521
00:52:13,600 --> 00:52:14,360
 I know.

1522
00:52:14,360 --> 00:52:16,760
 They just-- because it was such an important piece of art.

1523
00:52:16,760 --> 00:52:18,720
 And if you go there now, you can see,

1524
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:20,880
 at the point where the bridge is, the curb

1525
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:22,520
 is really high above the road.

1526
00:52:22,520 --> 00:52:24,120
 Because the road is several inches there.

1527
00:52:24,120 --> 00:52:25,120
 Oh, it's still there.

1528
00:52:25,120 --> 00:52:26,120
 I'd love to know where that is.

1529
00:52:26,120 --> 00:52:27,280
 That's amazing.

1530
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:30,200
 Which van Dyke, who are we talking about?

1531
00:52:30,200 --> 00:52:32,120
 Van Dyke.

1532
00:52:32,120 --> 00:52:34,640
 Yes, Dick Van Dyke and Leonardo DiCaprio,

1533
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:39,080
