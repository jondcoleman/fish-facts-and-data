00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:02.320
 - Hi everyone, before we start this week's show,

00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:04.080
 we want to tell you about the winners

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.840
 of this year's prestigious Heinz Oberhummer Award

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:09.560
 for Science Communication.

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:11.760
 - That's exciting, okay, who got it?

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:13.000
 - Us, no.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.120
 - Yes, that is amazing.

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:16.400
 - It's so cool.

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:18.960
 And what it means is that we get to go to Vienna

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.480
 and we're gonna record a podcast there

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:23.000
 and it's gonna be a 300th episode

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.200
 and guess what, you can get tickets.

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:26.680
 - That was the funniest piece of acting I've ever seen

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:28.240
 there at the start, by the way, guys.

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:29.320
 But that is indeed correct.

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:31.160
 If you are listening from Vienna or Austria

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:33.400
 or if you fancy a trip there on the 25th of November,

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:36.560
 then go to nosuchthingasaffish.com

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:38.360
 and you'll see the link there to get tickets

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:40.520
 and see us perform our 300th episode.

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:43.080
 - Is this in the world I see before me?

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:43.920
 - No, I'll go.

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.080
 - Oh, that was good.

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:46.520
 - Now, pipe down on with the show.

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:49.360
 (blues music)

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:50.840
 - Who the fuck is this?

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:53.120
 (blues music)

00:00:53.120 --> 00:01:01.520
 - Who's not ready?

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:03.280
 - I'm not ready, but Karen's not ready.

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:04.280
 - Karen's not ready.

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:06.640
 - Hello and welcome to another episode

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:09.240
 of nosuchthingasaffish, a weekly podcast

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.160
 coming to you from the QI offices in Covert Garden.

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:13.280
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:15.360
 I am sitting here with Anna Chazinski,

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.720
 Andrew Hunter Murray and James Harkin.

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:20.040
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.880
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:26.080
 and in no particular order, here we go.

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:28.480
 Starting with you, James.

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:30.080
 - Oh, it really?

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:31.840
 I thought it was what are you guys first?

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:37.360
 - My fact this week is that the US Navy's Doomsday aircraft,

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:40.080
 which was designed to survive a nuclear attack,

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:42.920
 was recently taken out by a single bird.

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:46.680
 Okay, this was in the news.

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.160
 A few people might have seen it.

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:51.120
 The US Navy called it a class A mishap.

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:53.240
 (laughing)

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:56.240
 - That feels like something that would be an PG Woodhouse novel.

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:57.080
 - I'm telling you what, jeez,

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:58.960
 this is a class A mishap we've just had.

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:02.760
 - It was the E6B Mercury.

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:06.240
 It's a Boeing 707, which supposedly,

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.920
 if there is a nuclear bomb that goes off nearby,

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:10.320
 it's supposed to be okay.

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:12.640
 But actually, a bird got into its engine

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:15.080
 and it had to make an emergency stop.

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:17.920
 The engine had to be replaced and it cost them

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:19.320
 about $2 million.

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:20.560
 - Oh, wow.

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.120
 - That is a class A mishap.

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:23.120
 - That is.

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:24.960
 And so I was really curious about this plane

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:28.200
 because it's sort of, it's like the less fancy,

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.920
 but tougher brother of Air Force One, basically.

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:32.560
 - Yeah, although Air Force One is anything

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:33.880
 that the president's on, of course.

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:34.720
 - Yes.

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:36.600
 - But the particular Air Force One that we know about,

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:39.320
 yeah, it's a souped-up version of this one.

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:42.000
 - Yeah, it's all nuclear command centers

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.840
 as opposed to nice beds and desks and cool press rooms

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:46.880
 and things like that.

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:49.040
 But I wonder, 'cause it's, I read this,

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.640
 I couldn't believe that it could survive a nuclear attack.

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:53.040
 And they say it can survive a nuclear attack.

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.560
 When I just wonder how close it can be

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:56.400
 for a nuclear attack.

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.880
 'Cause if you drop a nuclear bomb on it, it would,

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:59.720
 - Yeah.

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:02.480
 - In many ways, you know, most of the people in the world

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:06.280
 could survive a nuclear attack depending on where the bomb is.

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:08.000
 - Yeah, that's absolutely true.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.760
 - If a bomb stops in Australia, I reckon I'll be okay.

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:13.400
 - They said it was, they said they've got all sorts of,

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:15.440
 I read they had mesh to prevent radiation

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:16.280
 and other things.

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:17.400
 - Yeah, they have that, you know.

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:20.280
 - And also, it's strong enough to survive the pulses

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:23.240
 of electromagnetic energy that come from a nuclear bomb.

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:24.080
 - Oh, okay.

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:26.160
 - Cosumably, like you say, not if it lands on the nose.

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:27.320
 (laughing)

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:28.480
 I do see what you mean by that.

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:31.320
 - Maybe it's 'cause it can only flyably for about 10 hours,

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:33.120
 10 hours worth of fuel.

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:35.280
 So maybe it has to make a landing in an area

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.760
 that's been recently bombed and all this meshing and stuff

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:40.200
 means that you would survive on the inside

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:43.480
 and not be turned into radioactive spider.

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:45.200
 (laughing)

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:46.480
 - I lost my thread at the end there.

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:47.840
 - No, you couldn't tell.

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:49.240
 (laughing)

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:50.440
 They are very cool.

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:51.280
 - Yeah.

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:52.280
 - Do we know what kind of bird it was?

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:53.760
 Was it at least a big bird?

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:55.840
 - We don't know what kind of, it was a big bird

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:57.720
 from Sesame Street, if that's what you're thinking.

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:58.560
 - Thank God.

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:00.520
 - Famously can't fly.

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:01.760
 We don't know what kind of bird it is.

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:04.480
 Although they have lots of labs in America

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:06.120
 who can find this kind of thing out.

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:09.480
 They like to scrape bits of bird off airplanes, don't they?

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:10.760
 And work out what's.

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:13.520
 - Yeah, using the DNA, they'll do it.

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:14.960
 And you just send in.

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:17.640
 There's a thing called, if you have a bird strike

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:19.080
 on your plane, it's called snarge.

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:21.080
 - Snarge, so there's, yeah, that's right.

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:23.160
 - And I wanted to know where this word came from.

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:24.000
 Did anyone find out?

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:24.840
 - No.

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:25.680
 - Okay, as far as I can see,

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:27.600
 it comes from the Smithsonian Institution's

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.800
 feather identification laboratory.

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:32.400
 And I think just the lab sciences have just called it snarge

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:34.880
 and it feels like it might be an acronym or something,

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:36.240
 but I don't really know.

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:38.360
 And when they first came up with it, one of the other words

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:40.960
 of phrases they used was birdic.

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:42.320
 - Snarge is quite onomatopoeic.

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:43.720
 I don't imagine they just sort of thought,

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:46.360
 "Oh, this sound sort of tells you that it's...

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:48.040
 - It's a gooey end."

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:49.960
 - Yeah, maybe snarge.

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:51.280
 - Snarge.

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:54.800
 - And in this lab, they will test things and work out

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:57.840
 exactly what will happen when any bird hits any aircraft.

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:01.040
 And they have invented the bird avoidance model

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:02.040
 or bam!

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:04.480
 - Nice.

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:05.320
 - Very cool.

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:08.160
 This isn't the only bird strike that hit a military plane

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:10.200
 this year with scary consequences.

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:13.840
 Yeah, so earlier this year, an Air Force A10 was flying

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:17.760
 through America over Florida and it got hit by a bird as well,

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:18.680
 hit the engine.

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:20.880
 But as a result of being hit by the bird,

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:23.160
 something in the plane malfunctioned and it ended up

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:26.920
 dropping three dummy rounds, basically three massive bombs,

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:31.360
 but they weren't charged over Florida and landed in Florida.

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:34.320
 And I mean, it was just so lucky that they were fake bombs.

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:36.800
 Because otherwise America would have just bombed its citizens.

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:39.400
 And then I read that story and I think if you'd have gone up to it

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:41.720
 and started prodding it with a stick, you could have got injured.

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:42.560
 - Yes.

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:43.560
 - That one people not to go near it, right?

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:44.400
 - Exactly.

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:45.400
 - You're still slightly charged.

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:47.160
 - Yeah, they're like, this is completely harmless.

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:50.000
 It's just the dummy bomb, but also please do not handle it

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:51.560
 under any circumstances.

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:53.160
 So if you are, and I don't know if they've found them.

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:54.440
 So if you are in Florida and you see,

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:55.800
 I think they're about 25 pounds.

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:59.120
 So they are quite, they're not huge, but in those spot ones.

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:01.680
 - Well, they said where it is, roughly.

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:05.040
 They said that in the general vicinity of two kilometers west

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:07.440
 of highway one, two, nine, every single location.

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:10.680
 But that's quite a big margin of error, I would say.

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:11.520
 - Yeah.

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:12.360
 - Yeah.

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:14.480
 Can we just say one more thing about these weird planes?

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:15.320
 - Yes, ma'am.

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:18.680
 - So they're called the National Airborne Operation Centers.

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:21.160
 And these are the ones, I don't know if you guys remember,

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:23.360
 but we spoke, I mentioned them a while ago,

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:26.000
 and you guys did not believe the fact that I said.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:26.840
 - Okay.

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:29.120
 - These are the ones which have antennas

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:30.600
 which are five miles long.

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:31.640
 - Oh, yes.

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:32.480
 - Oh, you remember?

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:33.320
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:34.160
 - Have you checked that?

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:35.000
 - Yeah.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:36.600
 - That's a long kite string, basically.

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:37.440
 - It's like a tail.

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:38.440
 It's like the plane's tail.

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:39.680
 Except planes already have tails.

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:41.400
 - It's like a second tail.

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:42.400
 - It's like a second tail.

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:43.240
 - Yeah.

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:46.680
 - And it's so it can communicate with submarines underwater.

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:48.640
 - Because they need extremely long waves.

00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:49.480
 - Yeah.

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:50.320
 - Exactly.

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:52.800
 And the point of the plane is that they tie everything together.

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:55.840
 So they tie together the bombers,

00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:57.400
 which have got nuclear weapons on them.

00:06:57.400 --> 00:06:59.560
 They tie together submarines, which have got nuclear warheads,

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:02.640
 and the ballistic missiles in their silos,

00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:04.760
 they can communicate with all of those

00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:07.160
 and basically coordinate a nuclear attack

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:09.080
 if America wants to make one.

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:09.920
 - Yeah.

00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:11.280
 - Or if it's been attacked and they wanted to retaliate.

00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:13.080
 - What's amazing about these planes is that

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:16.920
 they have a crew basically on standby waiting for Doomsday.

00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:19.200
 They're just there, maintaining the plane,

00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:22.000
 while the other three are getting prepared for their next round.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.680
 So they sort of swap spots as the ready plane.

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:26.720
 - So you come on your new shift and you go,

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:28.920
 "All right, Jeff, was it Doomsday on your shift?"

00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:29.760
 - Yeah.

00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:30.600
 - No, it wasn't Doomsday on my shift.

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:32.760
 - All right, okay, we'll see you after, see you in eight hours.

00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:33.920
 - One day.

00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:34.760
 - Yeah.

00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:37.120
 - Bird strikes, though, kind of a big problem

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:38.800
 or a big thing that, you know,

00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:40.400
 aircraft designers have to address.

00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:42.320
 And the first bird strike is sighted

00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:45.360
 as being Wilbur Wright of Wright Brothers' fame.

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:46.760
 - To the right.

00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:49.520
 - Yeah, and it was in 1905.

00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:52.400
 And it really raises my problem with the term bird strike

00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:54.880
 because it always gives too much agency to the birds.

00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:57.000
 And so in this case, it was 1905.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.080
 So it was only a couple of years after the first ever

00:07:59.080 --> 00:07:59.920
 powered flight.

00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:03.160
 And Wilbur Wright was putling about in his plane.

00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:05.000
 And he wrote in his diary,

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.680
 "I twice passed over the fences into this bloke's cornfield

00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:12.080
 and I chased flocks of birds on two rounds

00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:15.080
 and I managed to kill one in his engine

00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:17.360
 which then fell on top of the surface of the wing

00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:19.080
 and fell off when he did a sharp curve."

00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:20.640
 So basically, he chased and harassed

00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:22.880
 flocks of birds until he smashed into one

00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:24.680
 and then he dumped it off his wing.

00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:26.440
 And that's not a bird striking you.

00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:27.440
 - That's a plane strike.

00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:28.280
 - It's a plane strike.

00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:29.120
 - Yeah.

00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:30.560
 - I think that's what they should be called.

00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:33.160
 - Do you, but then what if anything else hits the plane?

00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:35.520
 - It could, oh, it could should be called bird receipt.

00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:36.960
 (laughing)

00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:39.000
 - Well, have you heard about the other kind of receipts

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.080
 that they have, they have frog receipts,

00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:43.240
 they have turtle receipts, they have snake receipts.

00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:44.880
 - Well, how high are those frogs jumping?

00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:45.880
 - It's amazing, right?

00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:50.160
 So according to these people who work at Smithsonian,

00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:53.120
 they get, because things get carried up by the jet stream,

00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:56.080
 often animals other than birds get hit by these planes.

00:08:56.080 --> 00:09:00.640
 And they quite recently got a rabbit that got hit by a plane.

00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:01.480
 - No.

00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:03.360
 - Yeah, so a rabbit receipt.

00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:04.560
 (laughing)

00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:05.720
 - Sorry, how does the rabbit get into there?

00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:07.680
 It's pulled up by the jet stream.

00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:08.520
 - By the jet stream.

00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:09.360
 - By the jet stream.

00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:10.560
 - By, you know, a tornado or.

00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:11.400
 (laughing)

00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:13.240
 - It's really quite rare.

00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:15.480
 - It sounds unlikely, doesn't it?

00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:17.040
 But this was actually in a Smithsonian.

00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:18.040
 - Well, you guys believe this,

00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:19.960
 and you don't believe a plane can have a long antenna.

00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:21.920
 - I'm just trying to explore this a bit.

00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:25.080
 - I think a lot of the animal sucks,

00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:27.120
 'cause they aren't, they are not called birds dry catchely

00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:28.120
 by people in the aviation.

00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:29.280
 - They're called animals sucks.

00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:30.400
 - They're not called animals sucks.

00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:31.400
 (laughing)

00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:33.080
 - They should be, they're called wildlife strikes,

00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:34.160
 'cause of the variety.

00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:36.480
 But the other ones who aren't birds seem to be mostly

00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:37.320
 on runways.

00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:39.600
 So in Florida, they have a bit of a crocodile problem,

00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:42.360
 where I think one crocodile did actually jump up

00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:43.520
 and hit the wing of a plane.

00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:47.120
 - It's a big crocodile jump, it flipped itself up to the level

00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:48.160
 of the plane apparently.

00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:49.000
 - Wow.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:50.360
 - This is the thing that happens in Florida occasion.

00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:52.760
 - I mean, there was one, I know what you're saying,

00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:54.960
 often on that, but this person who works

00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:57.720
 at the Smithsonian Institution Feather Identification

00:09:57.720 --> 00:10:01.960
 Laboratory said that they had a cat that was hit

00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:03.760
 at high altitude.

00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:04.600
 - What?

00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:05.440
 - So such a shame.

00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:07.360
 Only eight lives left for that whole cat.

00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:08.200
 (laughing)

00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:09.840
 - Could have been on the back of a broomstick.

00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:11.240
 - Could have been, who knows?

00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:12.440
 Who knows how it got there?

00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:14.960
 - On the early airstrikes thing.

00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:19.080
 Have you seen this amazing portrait of Eugene Gilbert,

00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:20.440
 who was a French pilot.

00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:23.880
 In 1911, he was flying from Paris to Madrid.

00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:26.400
 So very early, exciting air race.

00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:28.840
 And he was flying over the Pyrenees Mountains.

00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:31.040
 And he got tangled up with an eagle.

00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:33.120
 There was a mother eagle which flew down

00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:34.400
 and attacked him basically.

00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:37.160
 'Cause she was very protective of her area.

00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:39.400
 And he started firing his pistol at it

00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:41.480
 from inside the cockpit of this.

00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:42.960
 - Well, it must have been a biplane, I think.

00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:44.760
 Not to wound just to--

00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:45.600
 - Just to scare it.

00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:46.560
 - To scare it off, yeah.

00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:47.400
 But someone who--

00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:48.400
 - Should have thrown a cat at it.

00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:49.240
 - Should have.

00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:50.160
 (laughing)

00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:52.280
 - But someone has painted a portrait of this happening.

00:10:52.280 --> 00:10:54.120
 And it's an incredibly epic picture.

00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:56.200
 - Wow, that's amazing.

00:10:56.200 --> 00:10:58.400
 - We should say it's really, really rare as well.

00:10:58.400 --> 00:10:59.240
 - Oh yeah.

00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:03.480
 - So I think the amazing stat is that since 1912,

00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:05.760
 there have been 250 deaths from bird strikes

00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:07.960
 due to all flights ever.

00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:10.040
 So it's incredibly unlikely.

00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:12.440
 But obviously still it is quite important to avoid them.

00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:15.120
 And the testing, have we mentioned the chicken gun before?

00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:16.280
 - I don't think we have.

00:11:16.280 --> 00:11:17.120
 - We have.

00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:20.320
 - So there used to be experiments on plane engines

00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:22.400
 in the testing phase where you would fire a bird

00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:24.680
 from a gas cannon into the engine

00:11:24.680 --> 00:11:27.680
 and see what happened, basically.

00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:30.560
 And they've now replaced it, Boo,

00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:35.560
 with a block of gelatin, which is the same density as,

00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:36.560
 for example.

00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:38.400
 Checking's about example 'cause they're flightless.

00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:39.920
 They're probably not gonna end up in the engines,

00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:42.080
 but yeah, as a goose.

00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:45.640
 - Easy to get though, easier to pick up.

00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:46.480
 - Very true.

00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:48.320
 - And they used to put frozen ones in, didn't they?

00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:50.920
 Because, and one theory was that,

00:11:50.920 --> 00:11:52.560
 well, there are a few reasons you might do that.

00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:54.960
 One might be because a frozen one would be,

00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:57.040
 basically as hard as a bird can be.

00:11:57.040 --> 00:11:58.200
 You know, I'm gonna get harder bird

00:11:58.200 --> 00:11:59.040
 than a frozen chicken.

00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:01.120
 - But you might as well then just do it with a rock.

00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:02.680
 Why isn't your frozen chicken?

00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:04.840
 - Well, one of the reasons is because they thought

00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:07.480
 that if a bird was flying in and it was about to get hit,

00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:08.920
 it might tense all of its muscles

00:12:08.920 --> 00:12:10.400
 'cause it thought it was gonna get hit

00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:13.160
 and that would be similar to a frozen chicken.

00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:15.040
 - That seems exactly what you would do, isn't it?

00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:15.880
 - That's what I would do.

00:12:15.880 --> 00:12:16.720
 - Yeah.

00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:18.520
 - But it is a stressful and situation to be in.

00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:19.360
 - Yeah.

00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:22.040
 - You wouldn't relax and go floppy, even if you knew

00:12:22.040 --> 00:12:23.240
 that was what you were supposed to do

00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:25.040
 to increase your chances of survival.

00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:28.640
 - Apparently these days most of the testing

00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:30.280
 is by computer simulation.

00:12:30.280 --> 00:12:31.120
 - That makes more sense.

00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:32.760
 - It does make more sense, but for me,

00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:33.880
 it's not good enough.

00:12:33.880 --> 00:12:34.720
 - No.

00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:35.800
 - No, I want to be flying in a plane

00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:37.680
 that's had a chicken fired at it.

00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:40.480
 - Do you know what it is that kills the plane?

00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:42.480
 - I would have thought it hits the engine

00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:46.760
 and then it snarges all up and then it can't spin around

00:12:46.760 --> 00:12:48.880
 that gets really hot and it sets on fire.

00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:51.080
 - Can I just quickly say excellent use of snarge?

00:12:51.080 --> 00:12:54.920
 - I don't think snarge is a verb.

00:12:54.920 --> 00:12:57.200
 - I think it's any kind of word, yeah.

00:12:57.200 --> 00:12:58.200
 - Yeah, right, fair enough.

00:12:58.200 --> 00:13:01.400
 - Does it accidentally make one blade smash into another blade

00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:02.720
 and then that causes all the...

00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:05.080
 - Basically, it bends one blade in the engine.

00:13:05.080 --> 00:13:07.640
 So what they're trying to do when they throw the chicken

00:13:07.640 --> 00:13:09.920
 at it is make sure that the blades can withstand

00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:11.280
 the chicken blow without bending.

00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:13.760
 'Cause as soon as one bends and the engine stools.

00:13:13.760 --> 00:13:16.000
 But the worst thing that can happen is if it hits

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.960
 or if something hits one of the fan blades in the engine

00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:21.360
 or if there's just a bit of wear and tear and they snap,

00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:22.960
 which does happen every few years.

00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:25.520
 And that's the main plane sort of hazard

00:13:25.520 --> 00:13:27.200
 that they're trying to test against

00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:29.240
 because if one fan blade snaps,

00:13:29.240 --> 00:13:31.080
 then it turns into kind of shrapnel.

00:13:31.080 --> 00:13:32.440
 So it's spinning around really, really fast.

00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:34.320
 It's inside the engine, turns into shrapnel

00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:35.880
 and then it flies through the engine.

00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:37.640
 So it breaks the whole engine down.

00:13:37.640 --> 00:13:40.680
 And so they have to do these, like most of the money goes

00:13:40.680 --> 00:13:44.480
 into doing these crazy tests where they have these fans.

00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:47.240
 So like picture sort of a ceiling fan.

00:13:47.240 --> 00:13:48.080
 And each plane...

00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:49.080
 - No, no, no, no.

00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:49.920
 (laughter)

00:13:49.920 --> 00:13:52.480
 - Just remember last week's podcast at the Mulan Rouge.

00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:55.000
 (laughter)

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.080
 - You're not a plane spotter.

00:13:57.080 --> 00:13:58.800
 You're just a plane fan spotter.

00:13:58.800 --> 00:14:02.280
 Each blade costs about the same as like a luxury car

00:14:02.280 --> 00:14:03.120
 about 50 grand.

00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:06.040
 So each fan is worth about nine million dollars

00:14:06.040 --> 00:14:08.360
 'cause they're really special shapes.

00:14:08.360 --> 00:14:10.040
 And they have to be an incredibly special light,

00:14:10.040 --> 00:14:11.360
 but strong material.

00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:13.600
 And then they have to throw stuff at them

00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:16.920
 or explode them to see if they can still function

00:14:16.920 --> 00:14:18.720
 with them exploded.

00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:20.880
 - I've got a couple land-based bird strikes.

00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:21.720
 - Okay.

00:14:21.720 --> 00:14:23.320
 - Non-plane related.

00:14:23.320 --> 00:14:26.080
 So do you know the Le Mans, the car race?

00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:26.920
 - I do.

00:14:26.920 --> 00:14:29.840
 The town of Le Mans is twinned with Bolton.

00:14:29.840 --> 00:14:30.680
 - Is it?

00:14:30.680 --> 00:14:32.280
 - Yeah, that's cool.

00:14:32.280 --> 00:14:35.400
 So 1953, the winner was a guy called Duncan Hamilton,

00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:38.360
 I believe his name was, and Duncan Hamilton won it

00:14:38.360 --> 00:14:40.720
 despite being absolutely pissed off his face.

00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:44.760
 He was so drunk, he and his buddy had done a practice circuit

00:14:44.760 --> 00:14:47.160
 before the race, and this is a bit confusing,

00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:49.080
 but they had the same plates as another car

00:14:49.080 --> 00:14:51.080
 that was on there, which apparently is illegal.

00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:52.960
 And so they got disqualified from the race.

00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:54.240
 So they thought, "Well, we're on holiday.

00:14:54.240 --> 00:14:55.240
 "Let's just go to the bar."

00:14:55.240 --> 00:14:56.520
 I got absolutely tanked.

00:14:56.520 --> 00:15:00.440
 And then the guy who was the manager of the Jaguar team,

00:15:00.440 --> 00:15:03.040
 who they raced for, called Lofty England.

00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:03.880
 - Ow.

00:15:03.880 --> 00:15:05.680
 (all laughing)

00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:08.040
 - He should be the head of the Brexit party.

00:15:08.040 --> 00:15:08.880
 (all laughing)

00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:10.920
 - He persuaded the organizers to let them both race,

00:15:10.920 --> 00:15:12.320
 but they were completely smashed,

00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:13.320
 but they did it anyway.

00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:14.640
 And in between the pit stops,

00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:17.000
 they were desperately trying to sober up Hamilton with coffee.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.880
 So it sort of changed your wheels and give you a drink.

00:15:19.880 --> 00:15:21.520
 And this is a 24-hour race.

00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:25.400
 It's one of the most long-hard and enduring races.

00:15:25.400 --> 00:15:27.960
 But halfway through the race, or not halfway,

00:15:27.960 --> 00:15:30.320
 but along the race, a bird,

00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:32.800
 flew into his face at 130 miles an hour.

00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:34.480
 (all laughing)

00:15:34.480 --> 00:15:36.440
 But they think, 'cause he was so wasted,

00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:38.320
 he kind of shrugged off the pain of it

00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:39.520
 and managed to continue.

00:15:39.520 --> 00:15:41.040
 And one, they won the race,

00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:42.800
 despite being smashed in the face.

00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:44.080
 - That would take your face off.

00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:46.720
 - I'm not going to ride on the boat, if it was a wreck.

00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:48.760
 - Yeah, if it was an albatross.

00:15:48.760 --> 00:15:50.160
 - Yeah, it would be incredible.

00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:51.000
 (all laughing)

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:54.600
 - I mean, there was a thing, Fabio, who is...

00:15:54.600 --> 00:15:55.440
 - Fabio.

00:15:55.440 --> 00:15:56.720
 - Fabio's a male model.

00:15:56.720 --> 00:15:57.920
 He appears on romance books.

00:15:57.920 --> 00:16:00.080
 He was in the, I can't believe it's not Butter ads.

00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:01.560
 - It's weird that you expected us to know that,

00:16:01.560 --> 00:16:04.000
 but if I'd have to guess, I would have said he was a male model.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:04.840
 - He's the male model.

00:16:04.840 --> 00:16:08.680
 - He was on, I think, something like 200 romance novels.

00:16:08.680 --> 00:16:11.080
 - Yeah, he looks like Conan the Barbarian

00:16:11.080 --> 00:16:12.640
 who's got this huge, flowing blood loss.

00:16:12.640 --> 00:16:14.160
 - Huge main, the most beautiful...

00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:15.400
 - Guys, guys, calm down.

00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:16.240
 (all laughing)

00:16:16.240 --> 00:16:17.240
 You know who you're talking about now?

00:16:17.240 --> 00:16:18.080
 - He's a guy.

00:16:18.080 --> 00:16:20.160
 - Yeah, he was known as the most beautiful man in the world.

00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:22.160
 Anyway, he was opening a roller coaster,

00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:24.120
 and so he was on the ride.

00:16:24.120 --> 00:16:27.840
 He was going 73 miles an hour down the first drop

00:16:27.840 --> 00:16:30.960
 when a 10-pound goose flew into his face.

00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:33.880
 - Oh my God, I'd love it if the photo went off just at that moment.

00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:35.600
 (all laughing)

00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:38.240
 - Oh, wow, that, and then there are photos of him.

00:16:38.240 --> 00:16:39.080
 - Of him.

00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:40.920
 - Of him being hit, but of him coming back in,

00:16:40.920 --> 00:16:42.680
 just spitting feathers out of his mouth.

00:16:42.680 --> 00:16:45.280
 - Yeah, his entire face is bloodied.

00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:46.760
 - He was on the roller coaster ride

00:16:46.760 --> 00:16:49.440
 with a load of sort of models and things like this,

00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:52.000
 because it was a big PR launch of the roller coaster.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:52.840
 - Yeah.

00:16:52.840 --> 00:16:54.440
 - And you just see the carriage coming back in.

00:16:54.440 --> 00:16:57.600
 All of the traumatized, he's covered in blood.

00:16:57.600 --> 00:16:58.840
 - He's got a broken nose, yeah.

00:16:58.840 --> 00:17:01.320
 - Do you not think it might have been a jealous fellow model

00:17:01.320 --> 00:17:03.800
 who's just taken a goose at the roller coaster?

00:17:03.800 --> 00:17:04.640
 (all laughing)

00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:06.120
 - Well, his looks were in forever.

00:17:06.120 --> 00:17:07.360
 - No, of course it, you guys.

00:17:07.360 --> 00:17:08.360
 - Roon Fabius looks.

00:17:08.360 --> 00:17:09.600
 - That's a beautiful man in the world.

00:17:09.600 --> 00:17:11.840
 - They were actually improved, yeah, the goose.

00:17:11.840 --> 00:17:14.440
 (upbeat music)

00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:18.440
 - Okay, it's time for fact number two,

00:17:18.440 --> 00:17:19.760
 and that is my fact.

00:17:19.760 --> 00:17:22.480
 My fact this week is that when nylon stockings

00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:24.880
 became rationed during World War II,

00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:27.760
 department stores set up leg makeup bars

00:17:27.760 --> 00:17:29.160
 where women could have stockings

00:17:29.160 --> 00:17:31.880
 drawn onto their legs instead.

00:17:31.880 --> 00:17:32.720
 - Very cool.

00:17:32.720 --> 00:17:34.880
 - Yeah, they would just go to the shop

00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:36.560
 and they would take hours at a time,

00:17:36.560 --> 00:17:39.520
 and they would draw the hem line at the back of their leg,

00:17:39.520 --> 00:17:41.400
 and they would put powders and so on.

00:17:41.400 --> 00:17:44.000
 - Would they kind of paint the leg

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:45.000
 to look a slightly different color

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:46.000
 and then draw the line?

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:48.080
 - Yeah, do you put it in like an old cup of tea

00:17:48.080 --> 00:17:49.800
 for a little while until it stays?

00:17:49.800 --> 00:17:50.640
 (all laughing)

00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:51.480
 - Like the leg.

00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:52.960
 - The leg is a big cup of tea.

00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:54.640
 (all laughing)

00:17:54.640 --> 00:17:55.480
 - That's a nice idea.

00:17:55.480 --> 00:17:57.200
 You could put everyone in a jacuzzi

00:17:57.200 --> 00:17:59.040
 just sitting around the edges.

00:17:59.040 --> 00:17:59.880
 - Yeah.

00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:00.840
 - And then you could everyone can have a cup

00:18:00.840 --> 00:18:02.440
 and just take some of the tea.

00:18:02.440 --> 00:18:03.720
 - That would be lovely.

00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:06.320
 - Well, they did use to do it with gravy, I think, didn't they?

00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:07.160
 - Right.

00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:08.000
 - And with coffee, yeah.

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:09.360
 Because I think, so it's sort of like,

00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:11.600
 women used to just paint the lines up themselves,

00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:12.760
 I think. - Yes.

00:18:12.760 --> 00:18:14.800
 - Of and no, I didn't realize they had the salon

00:18:14.800 --> 00:18:16.880
 specifically to do it for the wealthier.

00:18:16.880 --> 00:18:18.480
 I suppose you don't get a wobbly line.

00:18:18.480 --> 00:18:19.480
 But yeah, if you were doing it at home,

00:18:19.480 --> 00:18:22.680
 you'd dip your leg in a sort of vat of gravy

00:18:22.680 --> 00:18:24.840
 or cocoa powder was another substitute.

00:18:24.840 --> 00:18:27.400
 - Amazing, considering a time of extreme rationing

00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:29.600
 and deprivation that people just have a vat

00:18:29.600 --> 00:18:32.160
 of gravy like around solely for their legs.

00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:33.240
 (all laughing)

00:18:33.240 --> 00:18:34.840
 - Well, they had the priority straight.

00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:36.120
 - I don't know, in those days,

00:18:36.120 --> 00:18:38.560
 you probably would have to reuse the gravy, no?

00:18:38.560 --> 00:18:40.160
 - I'm sure you would, yeah.

00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:41.000
 - Yeah.

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:41.840
 - It's such a, I mean, it's just,

00:18:41.840 --> 00:18:43.280
 it's makeup for the legs, isn't it?

00:18:43.280 --> 00:18:44.120
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:18:44.120 --> 00:18:44.960
 - I'm not strong with that.

00:18:44.960 --> 00:18:45.800
 - Nothing wrong with it, no.

00:18:45.800 --> 00:18:47.880
 - Makeup is just drawing another face on your face.

00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:49.440
 - So why not draw another leg on your leg?

00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:50.280
 - Exactly.

00:18:50.280 --> 00:18:51.600
 (all laughing)

00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:52.440
 It's brilliant.

00:18:52.440 --> 00:18:54.480
 It's because people were obsessed with nylon.

00:18:54.480 --> 00:18:56.760
 I mean, it was so bizarre that nylon craze,

00:18:56.760 --> 00:18:59.320
 because basically, I think it was invented in about 35

00:18:59.320 --> 00:19:02.400
 and it owned or 34 and it only became commercially available

00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:04.280
 in 37 or 38.

00:19:04.280 --> 00:19:07.520
 And by the time the war hit, people were obsessed with it

00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:09.360
 to the extent that as soon as it started being rationed

00:19:09.360 --> 00:19:11.680
 'cause it was needed for various wartime instruments,

00:19:11.680 --> 00:19:13.160
 they went nuts and they were desperate

00:19:13.160 --> 00:19:14.600
 to show that they still sort of had nylon.

00:19:14.600 --> 00:19:16.320
 There was this big black market

00:19:16.320 --> 00:19:18.080
 where nylon went for sort of the equivalent

00:19:18.080 --> 00:19:21.320
 of about $500 today, you'd get a pair of nylon tights.

00:19:21.320 --> 00:19:22.160
 - For just one.

00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:23.160
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:25.520
 Did they get people like trying to steal your tights off you

00:19:25.520 --> 00:19:27.920
 'cause they're so expensive, like an iPhone?

00:19:27.920 --> 00:19:29.760
 - Oh, probably, if it's so hard to steal tights

00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:32.040
 'cause they aren't quite well adhered to the legs, aren't they?

00:19:32.040 --> 00:19:33.760
 - And you could be pulling them, pulling it, turns out.

00:19:33.760 --> 00:19:35.560
 It's just gravy good things.

00:19:35.560 --> 00:19:37.160
 (all laughing)

00:19:37.160 --> 00:19:39.400
 But I think it's quite harsh 'cause let you say,

00:19:39.400 --> 00:19:40.160
 everyone loved them.

00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:42.680
 It was like the most amazing thing of its day.

00:19:42.680 --> 00:19:45.920
 And let you say, everyone got it for a few years

00:19:45.920 --> 00:19:47.560
 and then it was taken away 'cause of the war.

00:19:47.560 --> 00:19:49.760
 It's like, as if we all had iPhones

00:19:49.760 --> 00:19:51.280
 and then they go after three years,

00:19:51.280 --> 00:19:52.720
 you can't have iPhones anymore.

00:19:52.720 --> 00:19:54.040
 That would be harsh.

00:19:54.040 --> 00:19:54.880
 - I would.

00:19:54.880 --> 00:19:56.320
 - The world might be a better place.

00:19:56.320 --> 00:19:57.320
 (all laughing)

00:19:57.320 --> 00:19:59.920
 - The first day of sales, nationally in America,

00:19:59.920 --> 00:20:02.120
 was the 16th of May, 1940.

00:20:02.120 --> 00:20:03.720
 So the rest of the world was at war.

00:20:03.720 --> 00:20:05.320
 America hadn't quite decided yet.

00:20:05.320 --> 00:20:08.840
 And the statistics vary, but some people say

00:20:08.840 --> 00:20:11.720
 that four million pairs were sold in four days.

00:20:11.720 --> 00:20:13.840
 That was true, mania.

00:20:13.840 --> 00:20:16.000
 But this is a bit like, telly, I think.

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:17.760
 Didn't Britain just get TV?

00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:19.040
 And then the war happened and they said,

00:20:19.040 --> 00:20:22.200
 well, we're not gonna do TV anymore for the next six years.

00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:25.120
 And then it started again in the late '40s or early '50s.

00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:27.160
 There's a lot of those inventions which have been existing,

00:20:27.160 --> 00:20:29.240
 but it was just back burner for the war.

00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:31.600
 - And then post war, when they were available again,

00:20:31.600 --> 00:20:33.480
 there were nylon riots.

00:20:33.480 --> 00:20:35.560
 It was, 'cause they didn't have enough stock

00:20:35.560 --> 00:20:36.920
 for the amount of people who wanted

00:20:36.920 --> 00:20:37.760
 and were obsessed with them,

00:20:37.760 --> 00:20:39.560
 and been waiting for them to come back.

00:20:39.560 --> 00:20:43.320
 So in Pittsburgh, they had 40,000 people lining up

00:20:43.320 --> 00:20:47.040
 over a mile, even though there was only 13,000 pairs available.

00:20:47.040 --> 00:20:50.560
 So you can imagine the chaos when those shops opened the doors.

00:20:50.560 --> 00:20:51.800
 - Yeah, there used to be, you know,

00:20:51.800 --> 00:20:54.480
 police would have to be deployed quite a lot, I think.

00:20:54.480 --> 00:20:56.280
 This was sort of '45 and '46.

00:20:56.280 --> 00:20:59.200
 There was, I think, do pont the main company

00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:01.640
 that made the tights or the stockings.

00:21:01.640 --> 00:21:03.720
 They said they would make 360 million pairs

00:21:03.720 --> 00:21:05.280
 as soon as the war ended within a year.

00:21:05.280 --> 00:21:07.240
 And they could not live up to that at all.

00:21:07.240 --> 00:21:09.080
 People went nuts, got really excited.

00:21:09.080 --> 00:21:11.640
 So there was, yeah, there's 16 block queue

00:21:11.640 --> 00:21:12.840
 where people started fighting.

00:21:12.840 --> 00:21:14.440
 In Georgia, there were fist fights

00:21:14.440 --> 00:21:16.920
 and police had to be called to break them up.

00:21:16.920 --> 00:21:20.080
 There was a mob in Chicago of 1,200 women

00:21:20.080 --> 00:21:21.280
 who were outside a dress shop

00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:22.840
 just bashing on the windows again.

00:21:22.840 --> 00:21:24.200
 Police had to be called.

00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:25.040
 They went mad.

00:21:25.040 --> 00:21:26.080
 They went hysterical.

00:21:26.080 --> 00:21:28.240
 I don't want to, you know, be stereotyping here,

00:21:28.240 --> 00:21:30.080
 but they lost their shit, though.

00:21:30.080 --> 00:21:32.280
 (laughing)

00:21:32.280 --> 00:21:34.560
 - People were scared of nylon,

00:21:34.560 --> 00:21:36.920
 because partly because it had this weird process

00:21:36.920 --> 00:21:39.200
 by which it was made, it was sort of acid and stuff.

00:21:39.200 --> 00:21:41.120
 And partly because there was just this huge Ferrari

00:21:41.120 --> 00:21:42.520
 about it, so there's a backlash.

00:21:42.520 --> 00:21:45.000
 And all these rumors went around about what it could do,

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:47.640
 so people thought it would give you cancer of the legs.

00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:50.360
 They thought it mounted in hot water.

00:21:50.360 --> 00:21:52.600
 I don't know why it'd go in hot water wearing tights,

00:21:52.600 --> 00:21:54.600
 but it was that.

00:21:54.600 --> 00:21:56.800
 They feel like snakes when wet.

00:21:56.800 --> 00:21:57.640
 (laughing)

00:21:57.640 --> 00:21:59.640
 - The same thing reported.

00:21:59.640 --> 00:22:01.200
 People thought they were made from corpses

00:22:01.200 --> 00:22:02.960
 because there was a thing called cadaverine,

00:22:02.960 --> 00:22:04.360
 which was gathered from course up

00:22:04.360 --> 00:22:06.120
 and it's gathered from corpses to make stuff,

00:22:06.120 --> 00:22:06.960
 but they weren't.

00:22:06.960 --> 00:22:08.120
 It was a rumor.

00:22:08.120 --> 00:22:09.760
 - Wait, so cadaverine didn't exist?

00:22:09.760 --> 00:22:11.960
 - I think cadaverine, I think it did exist.

00:22:11.960 --> 00:22:14.240
 It was a chemical that you could get from rotting cadavers

00:22:14.240 --> 00:22:15.240
 that comes from rotting cadavers.

00:22:15.240 --> 00:22:16.720
 - I think that's the word that people used

00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:19.360
 for just like human snarge, basically.

00:22:19.360 --> 00:22:20.680
 - Human snarge, right.

00:22:20.680 --> 00:22:23.600
 - The thing is with this is it was a very smelly process.

00:22:23.600 --> 00:22:25.320
 Like the industrial process was really smelly,

00:22:25.320 --> 00:22:27.120
 so when journalists went there,

00:22:27.120 --> 00:22:28.760
 they smelled how bad it was.

00:22:28.760 --> 00:22:31.600
 And I think actually one newspaper did say

00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:33.680
 that this happened in a newspaper article

00:22:33.680 --> 00:22:35.800
 and everyone believed it when obviously it wasn't true.

00:22:35.800 --> 00:22:36.640
 - Oh, yeah.

00:22:36.640 --> 00:22:38.240
 - That's great.

00:22:38.240 --> 00:22:40.480
 - And there was, I think there was one other report

00:22:40.480 --> 00:22:43.440
 in a paper of a woman who was standing at a bus stop

00:22:43.440 --> 00:22:46.560
 and the bus went past and the exhaust fumes

00:22:46.560 --> 00:22:49.520
 of the bus stripped the nylon off her legs completely.

00:22:49.520 --> 00:22:51.560
 I know all these rumors that the nylon would just fall

00:22:51.560 --> 00:22:52.400
 off your legs.

00:22:52.400 --> 00:22:53.400
 - It's like a belly hilt.

00:22:53.400 --> 00:22:57.760
 - I think with people thought they might burn,

00:22:57.760 --> 00:22:58.600
 did you say?

00:22:58.600 --> 00:22:59.440
 - Yeah, melt.

00:22:59.440 --> 00:23:01.760
 - I think so because you've got this basically a plastic

00:23:01.760 --> 00:23:02.600
 as it is polymer.

00:23:02.600 --> 00:23:03.440
 - Yeah.

00:23:03.440 --> 00:23:05.040
 - So it makes sense that it would just melt on to you.

00:23:05.040 --> 00:23:06.040
 - It actually could a bit.

00:23:06.040 --> 00:23:08.480
 If it was too humid, the air would too damp,

00:23:08.480 --> 00:23:10.320
 then it could start melting down your legs.

00:23:10.320 --> 00:23:11.160
 - Really?

00:23:11.160 --> 00:23:16.000
 - There is a problem with nylon and health today,

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:17.760
 which is nylon teabags.

00:23:17.760 --> 00:23:20.760
 So they started coming in about 12 or 13 years ago

00:23:20.760 --> 00:23:22.840
 and I've found articles from a time saying,

00:23:22.840 --> 00:23:24.080
 hey, great new nylon teabags,

00:23:24.080 --> 00:23:25.680
 number of these boring paper teabags.

00:23:25.680 --> 00:23:28.360
 And you know, they're silky and they feel nice

00:23:28.360 --> 00:23:32.080
 and it turns out they're plastic, obviously.

00:23:32.080 --> 00:23:32.920
 - Plastic's bad for you.

00:23:32.920 --> 00:23:33.760
 - Plastic's bad.

00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:36.320
 So is that the most of the ones that I would get down

00:23:36.320 --> 00:23:37.680
 the shop so they like that?

00:23:37.680 --> 00:23:38.840
 - You are not real.

00:23:38.840 --> 00:23:43.320
 - So a normal packet of a normal packet of teabaget,

00:23:43.320 --> 00:23:46.440
 I think those are all paper except sometimes they're sealed

00:23:46.440 --> 00:23:48.160
 with a tiny, tiny blob of granite.

00:23:48.160 --> 00:23:50.840
 But the some coffee shops sell them in

00:23:50.840 --> 00:23:52.160
 and they look kind of weird and different.

00:23:52.160 --> 00:23:53.000
 - You mean the posh ones?

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:53.840
 - The posh ones?

00:23:53.840 --> 00:23:54.680
 - The posh ones.

00:23:54.680 --> 00:23:55.520
 - Yeah.

00:23:55.520 --> 00:23:56.360
 - There's posh and it feels like a bit like silk.

00:23:56.360 --> 00:23:57.760
 - Well, really posh ones are made of silk.

00:23:57.760 --> 00:23:59.280
 (laughing)

00:23:59.280 --> 00:24:00.120
 - Wow.

00:24:00.120 --> 00:24:03.160
 - But if you don't, if you can't run to these patee,

00:24:03.160 --> 00:24:04.600
 if you can't run to a silk.

00:24:04.600 --> 00:24:06.360
 - Back, someone will fobby off with a nylon one

00:24:06.360 --> 00:24:07.960
 and they've been studied.

00:24:07.960 --> 00:24:10.760
 So every single silky plasticity teabag

00:24:10.760 --> 00:24:13.920
 releases 11.6 billion microplastics.

00:24:13.920 --> 00:24:14.920
 These are very, very, very small.

00:24:14.920 --> 00:24:15.760
 - Jesus.

00:24:15.760 --> 00:24:18.440
 - And three billion nano plastics.

00:24:18.440 --> 00:24:20.960
 And those are extremely tiny, they're smaller.

00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:23.360
 Yeah, but they are, they are bad.

00:24:23.360 --> 00:24:26.240
 So the scientists tried feeding them to water fleas,

00:24:26.240 --> 00:24:29.240
 which are little tiny lobster animals

00:24:29.240 --> 00:24:31.160
 and they became very stressed

00:24:31.160 --> 00:24:34.040
 and the exoskeleton swelled up.

00:24:34.040 --> 00:24:35.760
 So it wasn't good for them.

00:24:35.760 --> 00:24:36.600
 - So, yeah.

00:24:36.600 --> 00:24:37.880
 - But it means that what you're saying is

00:24:37.880 --> 00:24:41.200
 in your cup of tea of posh, but not that posh tea,

00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:43.640
 then you're getting it into your body.

00:24:43.640 --> 00:24:45.880
 And basically, I mean, they're gonna find this

00:24:45.880 --> 00:24:46.720
 in years to come out.

00:24:46.720 --> 00:24:48.600
 It's gonna be, you know, when the Romans

00:24:48.600 --> 00:24:52.160
 had lead in the pipes, and they all went crazy.

00:24:52.160 --> 00:24:54.320
 And everyone knew it was 'cause of the lead in the pipes.

00:24:54.320 --> 00:24:57.000
 That's what it's gonna be, we're just eating plastic all the time.

00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:00.040
 - On the bristles on toothbrushes, plastic is,

00:25:00.040 --> 00:25:02.440
 I mean, they're nylon as well.

00:25:02.440 --> 00:25:04.000
 - Do you think this is gonna be the explanation

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:06.160
 of the person of Brexit and Donald Trump and all of that?

00:25:06.160 --> 00:25:08.240
 It's actually just, like, you know how we've discovered

00:25:08.240 --> 00:25:10.040
 the Salem Witch Crisis was,

00:25:10.040 --> 00:25:12.960
 people say it's caused by the ergo from the dodgy bread.

00:25:12.960 --> 00:25:16.520
 It's gonna be that we were just eating microplastics.

00:25:16.520 --> 00:25:17.520
 - That's it.

00:25:17.520 --> 00:25:20.000
 - Okay, I'm so glad about that because I hate those tea bags.

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:21.640
 They make awful tea.

00:25:21.640 --> 00:25:23.160
 - I don't think they're very permeable.

00:25:23.160 --> 00:25:24.200
 - They're not permeable enough.

00:25:24.200 --> 00:25:25.400
 That's exactly correct.

00:25:25.400 --> 00:25:27.280
 So the pretentious places serve them,

00:25:27.280 --> 00:25:28.800
 and you don't even taste any tea.

00:25:28.800 --> 00:25:30.760
 - I read an article that said that they're,

00:25:30.760 --> 00:25:32.920
 when they were trying to come up with the name for nylon,

00:25:32.920 --> 00:25:36.800
 there were over 400 options for what they wanted to go for.

00:25:36.800 --> 00:25:38.520
 Yeah, and there's a few that we know of.

00:25:38.520 --> 00:25:43.280
 So one was CLIS, K-L-I-S, which is silk backwards,

00:25:43.280 --> 00:25:44.720
 because this was, yeah, an awkward product.

00:25:44.720 --> 00:25:45.800
 - It was like, instead of silk,

00:25:45.800 --> 00:25:47.120
 crossing it, that's why it was so big.

00:25:47.120 --> 00:25:49.600
 - Exactly, yeah, this was like the cheap replacement,

00:25:49.600 --> 00:25:50.600
 the affordable replacement.

00:25:50.600 --> 00:25:54.360
 Neuron was one, which is actually no run.

00:25:54.360 --> 00:25:57.240
 - No run. - 'Cause the tights, so run.

00:25:57.240 --> 00:25:59.400
 And then there was Duporor.

00:25:59.400 --> 00:26:03.320
 And it's a shame it wasn't called that, Duporor.

00:26:03.320 --> 00:26:05.240
 D-U-P-A-R-W-H.

00:26:05.240 --> 00:26:06.760
 - I think it's more like Duporoo, you know.

00:26:06.760 --> 00:26:08.000
 - Oh, Duporoo. - Yeah.

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:09.640
 - Duporoo, like Winnie the Pooh, Duporoo.

00:26:09.640 --> 00:26:10.480
 - Okay, cool.

00:26:10.480 --> 00:26:11.320
 Yeah, sorry.

00:26:11.320 --> 00:26:12.640
 - Duporoo. - Duporoo, super Duporoo.

00:26:12.640 --> 00:26:13.640
 - Super Duporoo. - Yeah.

00:26:13.640 --> 00:26:15.200
 - Okay, so that was an acronym.

00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:18.440
 It stood for Dupont, pulls a rabbit out of a hat.

00:26:18.440 --> 00:26:19.280
 - Yes.

00:26:19.280 --> 00:26:20.200
 - And Dupont was the manufacturer.

00:26:20.200 --> 00:26:21.680
 - Yeah. - Right, yeah, yeah.

00:26:21.680 --> 00:26:25.040
 - We should say why they banded.

00:26:25.040 --> 00:26:28.840
 'Cause the reason, the reason it was so amazing

00:26:28.840 --> 00:26:31.680
 was that it was another material

00:26:31.680 --> 00:26:33.360
 which replaced silk, basically.

00:26:33.360 --> 00:26:35.240
 And before the war, America imported,

00:26:35.240 --> 00:26:38.800
 I think it was 80% of all the silk made in the world

00:26:38.800 --> 00:26:41.440
 was imported, and 90% of that was from Japan.

00:26:41.440 --> 00:26:43.840
 So obviously, when the USA and Japan were a war,

00:26:43.840 --> 00:26:44.680
 big problem.

00:26:44.680 --> 00:26:47.000
 And nylon was this incredible wonder substance,

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:50.240
 which really contributed to the USA winning the war,

00:26:50.240 --> 00:26:53.520
 because it made better parachutes than silk parachutes.

00:26:53.520 --> 00:26:55.640
 Silk parachutes got moldy, the heart of fold.

00:26:55.640 --> 00:26:59.800
 Nylons went better, and it was used for ropes and fuel tanks

00:26:59.800 --> 00:27:01.920
 and shoelaces and mosquito nets and hammers.

00:27:01.920 --> 00:27:03.760
 Just anything you could think of in the field

00:27:03.760 --> 00:27:05.000
 that was fabriky.

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:07.320
 Nylon was the thing, you know.

00:27:07.320 --> 00:27:09.280
 - Yeah, when we were told to hand in their tights,

00:27:09.280 --> 00:27:10.120
 weren't they?

00:27:10.120 --> 00:27:12.080
 It was sort of a patriotic war effort.

00:27:12.080 --> 00:27:15.600
 - Can you turn tights back into, let's say a fuel tank?

00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:16.440
 - Yeah, I believe they could,

00:27:16.440 --> 00:27:19.840
 because they weren't asked to do an amnesty.

00:27:19.840 --> 00:27:22.800
 And I think that one of the slogans was a Boeing super fortress

00:27:22.800 --> 00:27:26.040
 that lands on enough nylon to make 4,000 pairs of stockings.

00:27:26.040 --> 00:27:27.880
 So that's that it made the tires.

00:27:27.880 --> 00:27:30.120
 But they did ask people to hand in their stockings, so.

00:27:30.120 --> 00:27:32.560
 - I think you could turn it into a rope quite easily.

00:27:32.560 --> 00:27:33.560
 - Yeah, try it.

00:27:33.560 --> 00:27:35.640
 Or if you're in the USA as you could pull it over your head

00:27:35.640 --> 00:27:36.760
 for the disguise.

00:27:36.760 --> 00:27:37.760
 - Yeah, that's good.

00:27:37.760 --> 00:27:38.600
 - That's good.

00:27:38.600 --> 00:27:40.040
 - Cut a pair of my hulls.

00:27:40.040 --> 00:27:41.040
 - Yeah.

00:27:41.040 --> 00:27:44.160
 - Or if you're marching into Paris, saving Paris,

00:27:44.160 --> 00:27:46.240
 you could go into skies in the Mulan Rouge.

00:27:46.240 --> 00:27:47.760
 (laughing)

00:27:47.760 --> 00:27:49.720
 - A lot of callbacks to the free of your service.

00:27:49.720 --> 00:27:53.040
 - It's obvious as if I literally just edited it.

00:27:53.040 --> 00:27:55.760
 - James is trying to turn this into a long-running storyline.

00:27:55.760 --> 00:27:56.600
 A lot of five years.

00:27:56.600 --> 00:27:59.120
 We need some cut lines, imagine.

00:27:59.120 --> 00:28:00.160
 - We need a narrative.

00:28:00.160 --> 00:28:01.000
 - Yeah.

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:03.600
 (upbeat music)

00:28:03.600 --> 00:28:09.280
 - Okay, it is time for fact number three.

00:28:09.280 --> 00:28:11.560
 And that is Chisinski.

00:28:11.560 --> 00:28:15.000
 - My fact this week is that more than 80% of Japan's temples

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:17.440
 have suffered from raccoon damage.

00:28:18.600 --> 00:28:21.400
 And it's really sad because raccoons are not even native

00:28:21.400 --> 00:28:23.840
 to Japan, obviously, but they've swarmed there

00:28:23.840 --> 00:28:24.800
 the last few years.

00:28:24.800 --> 00:28:27.360
 And they're one of the main causes of damage to the temples.

00:28:27.360 --> 00:28:29.560
 So the advice to anyone out there

00:28:29.560 --> 00:28:32.360
 who's thinking about getting a raccoon for a pet is don't.

00:28:32.360 --> 00:28:35.440
 They will eat anything and they cause damage

00:28:35.440 --> 00:28:36.680
 to anywhere they are.

00:28:36.680 --> 00:28:39.880
 So in Japan, they've just climbed all around the temples

00:28:39.880 --> 00:28:42.720
 and they wanna find a nice little cozy nook to sleep in.

00:28:42.720 --> 00:28:45.480
 And they'll tear and eat and scratch through anything

00:28:45.480 --> 00:28:46.840
 that stands in their way.

00:28:46.840 --> 00:28:48.720
 - Is it because people have got them as pets

00:28:48.720 --> 00:28:50.000
 and then let them go or?

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:51.120
 - It is indeed.

00:28:51.120 --> 00:28:55.560
 So it's this weird story where there was a very, very popular show

00:28:55.560 --> 00:29:00.200
 in the '70s, in 1977 called "Rascal the Racoon."

00:29:00.200 --> 00:29:03.560
 And it was an animation, it was like an anime thing.

00:29:03.560 --> 00:29:05.600
 And people thought, "Oh, I wanna get a pet raccoon."

00:29:05.600 --> 00:29:08.120
 They obviously got the pets before they watched the end

00:29:08.120 --> 00:29:10.560
 'cause the moral of the show and the book it's based on

00:29:10.560 --> 00:29:12.880
 is that raccoons are terrible pets.

00:29:12.880 --> 00:29:14.120
 You can't take care of them.

00:29:14.120 --> 00:29:16.480
 And at the end, they had to release it back into the wild.

00:29:16.480 --> 00:29:17.720
 Anyway, people bought all these.

00:29:17.720 --> 00:29:19.560
 I think people were buying like 2000,

00:29:19.560 --> 00:29:21.480
 a year of being imported into Japan.

00:29:21.480 --> 00:29:23.480
 And then they started eating people's houses.

00:29:23.480 --> 00:29:24.680
 And so they released them.

00:29:24.680 --> 00:29:26.120
 - And they banned the imports, didn't they?

00:29:26.120 --> 00:29:27.560
 - Yeah, yeah, you can't do that.

00:29:27.560 --> 00:29:28.960
 - I read one source that said

00:29:28.960 --> 00:29:32.040
 they were importing 1,500 a month.

00:29:32.040 --> 00:29:33.040
 - Wow. - Wow.

00:29:33.040 --> 00:29:33.880
 - Jesus.

00:29:33.880 --> 00:29:34.720
 - Jesus. - It would be amazing.

00:29:34.720 --> 00:29:36.120
 - There's too many raccoons.

00:29:36.120 --> 00:29:36.960
 - It's too many.

00:29:36.960 --> 00:29:39.360
 I mean, if you're a country which doesn't have any raccoons,

00:29:39.360 --> 00:29:40.360
 then one is too many.

00:29:40.360 --> 00:29:41.800
 - You're right, you're absolutely right.

00:29:41.800 --> 00:29:45.920
 - And the author of this book is Sterling North.

00:29:45.920 --> 00:29:47.360
 Great name, Sterling North.

00:29:47.360 --> 00:29:48.680
 It's like lofty England.

00:29:48.680 --> 00:29:53.920
 He passed away a few years before this animation hit Japan.

00:29:53.920 --> 00:29:57.320
 So he never got to see the true sort of success

00:29:57.320 --> 00:30:00.600
 of his, he populated a country with an animal, basically.

00:30:00.600 --> 00:30:02.520
 - Yeah, but we're saying it's not really a success.

00:30:02.520 --> 00:30:03.840
 It's not a success story.

00:30:03.840 --> 00:30:05.680
 - It is if you're a raccoon.

00:30:05.680 --> 00:30:06.840
 And you want to travel.

00:30:06.840 --> 00:30:08.400
 - It's a huge win for raccoons.

00:30:08.400 --> 00:30:10.000
 And we know that Sterling North was interested

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:11.240
 in raccoons success.

00:30:11.240 --> 00:30:15.360
 - Yeah, we don't know what you felt about Japan doing.

00:30:15.360 --> 00:30:16.200
 - No.

00:30:16.200 --> 00:30:20.320
 - Because America's the only place where they're native.

00:30:20.320 --> 00:30:22.760
 But they've sort of invaded Germany as well now

00:30:22.760 --> 00:30:23.600
 in Europe.

00:30:23.600 --> 00:30:25.280
 - They haven't invaded, it's not like.

00:30:25.280 --> 00:30:26.120
 - Yeah.

00:30:26.120 --> 00:30:27.560
 - Well, I don't know because the European press

00:30:27.560 --> 00:30:29.360
 called them Nazi raccoons.

00:30:29.360 --> 00:30:30.200
 - Did they?

00:30:30.200 --> 00:30:31.040
 - Yeah.

00:30:31.040 --> 00:30:34.680
 If you look at any article in the last 10, 15 years

00:30:34.680 --> 00:30:37.520
 from some of the more salacious press, I must say,

00:30:37.520 --> 00:30:40.560
 they'll say, "Nazi raccoons coming to the Netherlands

00:30:40.560 --> 00:30:43.280
 on Nazi raccoons coming to France or something."

00:30:43.280 --> 00:30:45.480
 And that's because there was a theory

00:30:45.480 --> 00:30:47.960
 that the first ones were let into the wild

00:30:47.960 --> 00:30:49.320
 by Herman Goering.

00:30:49.320 --> 00:30:52.280
 This is a massive rumor.

00:30:52.280 --> 00:30:54.040
 And apparently he didn't do it.

00:30:54.040 --> 00:30:58.240
 They were let into the wild in Germany in 1934

00:30:58.240 --> 00:31:00.880
 to promote diversity of fauna.

00:31:00.880 --> 00:31:02.920
 But Goering had nothing to do with it.

00:31:02.920 --> 00:31:04.200
 But the rumor has persisted.

00:31:04.200 --> 00:31:06.960
 And so we get all these articles saying Nazi raccoons.

00:31:06.960 --> 00:31:09.560
 - Well, at least we stand that rumor out today.

00:31:09.560 --> 00:31:12.400
 (all laughing)

00:31:12.400 --> 00:31:16.080
 - In America, I don't know if they were kept as pets

00:31:16.080 --> 00:31:18.080
 because I guess they should be in the wild

00:31:18.080 --> 00:31:19.120
 hence the moral of the book.

00:31:19.120 --> 00:31:21.320
 But one person who did keep of raccoon as a pet

00:31:21.320 --> 00:31:23.600
 was the president of the United States

00:31:23.600 --> 00:31:25.920
 in the White House, Calvin College.

00:31:25.920 --> 00:31:26.760
 - Good day.

00:31:26.760 --> 00:31:28.560
 - Yeah, he had a raccoon called Rebecca.

00:31:28.560 --> 00:31:30.640
 And Rebecca was meant to be eaten

00:31:30.640 --> 00:31:32.800
 as part of a Thanksgiving dinner.

00:31:32.800 --> 00:31:35.480
 But he kind of just took to Rebecca instead.

00:31:35.480 --> 00:31:37.360
 - Did they used to eat that instead of turkey?

00:31:37.360 --> 00:31:38.200
 - Apparently.

00:31:38.200 --> 00:31:39.040
 - Did they?

00:31:39.040 --> 00:31:40.160
 - Well, they didn't.

00:31:40.160 --> 00:31:41.960
 It came from, was it Mississippi?

00:31:41.960 --> 00:31:43.760
 - I think sent him the raccoon.

00:31:43.760 --> 00:31:46.160
 And I think Calvin looked at it and when,

00:31:46.160 --> 00:31:48.160
 and someone said, it is edible mate.

00:31:48.160 --> 00:31:49.800
 And he said, it's not edible to me.

00:31:49.800 --> 00:31:51.440
 Take that away from you.

00:31:51.440 --> 00:31:54.000
 'Cause you know, it was claimed he was doing the decent thing.

00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:55.680
 And yeah, then they sort of laughed at it, didn't they?

00:31:55.680 --> 00:31:58.480
 - Yeah, proper pet, like she had an engraved collar

00:31:58.480 --> 00:31:59.800
 that she got for Christmas.

00:31:59.800 --> 00:32:01.280
 Yeah, she was a good pet.

00:32:01.280 --> 00:32:03.240
 - Did you read that Christmas when they gave her

00:32:03.240 --> 00:32:07.160
 the engraved collar, the present that they got their son

00:32:07.160 --> 00:32:09.200
 was a coat made of raccoon fur?

00:32:09.200 --> 00:32:11.200
 (all laughing)

00:32:11.200 --> 00:32:13.480
 - That's a good warning to Rebecca to behave.

00:32:13.480 --> 00:32:15.040
 - It's very good, isn't it?

00:32:15.040 --> 00:32:16.600
 - But the collar from the raccoon was made

00:32:16.600 --> 00:32:18.240
 from the rest bow and of that child.

00:32:18.240 --> 00:32:20.840
 (all laughing)

00:32:20.840 --> 00:32:25.440
 - They are really clever.

00:32:25.440 --> 00:32:26.280
 That's the amazing thing.

00:32:26.280 --> 00:32:28.160
 And I read an article saying that they,

00:32:28.160 --> 00:32:29.320
 in the early 20th century,

00:32:29.320 --> 00:32:31.560
 were used in a lot of lab experiments.

00:32:31.560 --> 00:32:34.120
 And that they could have been lab rats, basically.

00:32:34.120 --> 00:32:36.880
 Or they could have been the go-to for experimentation.

00:32:36.880 --> 00:32:38.560
 But basically, they're too good.

00:32:38.560 --> 00:32:39.600
 They're too clever.

00:32:39.600 --> 00:32:41.680
 They escape, they chew through things.

00:32:41.680 --> 00:32:43.520
 - They start performing experiments on us.

00:32:43.520 --> 00:32:44.920
 (all laughing)

00:32:44.920 --> 00:32:46.720
 - They get into the events and then,

00:32:46.720 --> 00:32:48.800
 and just they were a nightmare.

00:32:48.800 --> 00:32:51.840
 And it turns out that rats are a bit easier to control.

00:32:51.840 --> 00:32:53.200
 - Yeah. - Yeah.

00:32:53.200 --> 00:32:54.880
 - They're not hanging out with humans, don't they?

00:32:54.880 --> 00:32:57.240
 They're one of the species that has really thrived

00:32:57.240 --> 00:33:00.200
 from human, you know, building up urban environments.

00:33:00.200 --> 00:33:01.840
 They work very well in cities.

00:33:01.840 --> 00:33:04.160
 - They're like the American version of a fox,

00:33:04.160 --> 00:33:05.000
 like an urban fox.

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:06.880
 - I think they are, I think they're sort of like a better

00:33:06.880 --> 00:33:08.840
 version, like a grade up from foxes.

00:33:08.840 --> 00:33:12.600
 - They've got bloody hands, although not opposable thumbs.

00:33:12.600 --> 00:33:16.320
 The only thing we've got over them, one thing,

00:33:16.320 --> 00:33:17.320
 is opposable thumbs.

00:33:17.320 --> 00:33:19.520
 And this has actually proved quite crucial in the US.

00:33:19.520 --> 00:33:21.200
 Well, I'm sure there are lots of listeners

00:33:21.200 --> 00:33:23.880
 who have issues with raccoons breaking into your bins.

00:33:23.880 --> 00:33:26.720
 And so they're like constantly trying to upgrade bins

00:33:26.720 --> 00:33:28.880
 to make them inaccessible to raccoons.

00:33:28.880 --> 00:33:29.880
 But because they're so smart,

00:33:29.880 --> 00:33:32.080
 they keep on working out how to do it.

00:33:32.080 --> 00:33:34.080
 And then they have made one apparently,

00:33:34.080 --> 00:33:35.080
 which is clocked onto the fact

00:33:35.080 --> 00:33:36.600
 they don't have an opposable thumb.

00:33:36.600 --> 00:33:38.040
 So if you can do that.

00:33:38.040 --> 00:33:39.480
 - Is that in Toronto?

00:33:39.480 --> 00:33:40.520
 - I think it might be, yeah.

00:33:40.520 --> 00:33:44.000
 - Because Toronto spent $31 million

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:47.880
 getting a good raccoon proof bin in 2015.

00:33:47.880 --> 00:33:49.800
 They were so frustrated and they were really hard.

00:33:49.800 --> 00:33:53.320
 And the city's mayor wrote, "We are ready, we are armed

00:33:53.320 --> 00:33:55.640
 "and we are motivated to show that we cannot be defeated

00:33:55.640 --> 00:33:56.640
 "by these critters."

00:33:56.640 --> 00:33:57.800
 (laughing)

00:33:57.800 --> 00:33:59.400
 As they were being rolled out across the city,

00:33:59.400 --> 00:34:02.040
 he tweeted, "I love the smell of new raccoon-resistant

00:34:02.040 --> 00:34:03.880
 "green bins in the morning."

00:34:03.880 --> 00:34:07.360
 And within a few days, raccoons had managed

00:34:07.360 --> 00:34:09.720
 to make their way into a few of these samples.

00:34:09.720 --> 00:34:10.560
 - And beaten him.

00:34:10.560 --> 00:34:13.160
 (laughing)

00:34:13.160 --> 00:34:14.560
 - There's actually an argument, I think,

00:34:14.560 --> 00:34:17.040
 that it's quite bad that we keep on trying to upgrade

00:34:17.040 --> 00:34:19.560
 these bins because we're just making them cleverer now.

00:34:19.560 --> 00:34:21.960
 We're in this terrible arms race with raccoons

00:34:21.960 --> 00:34:24.840
 where the more we complexify the bins,

00:34:24.840 --> 00:34:25.680
 the better they're getting--

00:34:25.680 --> 00:34:26.680
 - I know what you're saying,

00:34:26.680 --> 00:34:28.720
 but then actually we're getting better as well.

00:34:28.720 --> 00:34:30.720
 So actually by them forcing us to get better,

00:34:30.720 --> 00:34:32.040
 we're getting smarter.

00:34:32.040 --> 00:34:33.320
 The raccoons are getting smarter.

00:34:33.320 --> 00:34:35.840
 It's the rest of the animal kingdoms that are losing it.

00:34:35.840 --> 00:34:37.120
 (laughing)

00:34:37.120 --> 00:34:38.920
 Eventually it'll just be a massive battle

00:34:38.920 --> 00:34:41.200
 between us and the raccoons with raccoons on it.

00:34:41.200 --> 00:34:43.240
 (laughing)

00:34:43.240 --> 00:34:46.000
 You were saying about how lots of towns really don't like them.

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:47.800
 There's an online factoid that says,

00:34:47.800 --> 00:34:50.280
 "If you take a raccoon head to the town hall

00:34:50.280 --> 00:34:53.560
 "of a town called Hanukkah, they'll give you $10."

00:34:53.560 --> 00:34:55.040
 And it says that all over the internet.

00:34:55.040 --> 00:34:55.880
 - Yeah.

00:34:55.880 --> 00:34:57.560
 - But when I read it, I emailed them,

00:34:57.560 --> 00:34:59.640
 and they said, "No, this is absolute rubbish."

00:34:59.640 --> 00:35:01.120
 (laughing)

00:35:01.120 --> 00:35:02.960
 So if you do have a raccoon head,

00:35:02.960 --> 00:35:04.720
 don't bother taking it to the town hall of Hanukkah.

00:35:04.720 --> 00:35:05.560
 - That's good.

00:35:05.560 --> 00:35:06.800
 I think we're doing a real public service.

00:35:06.800 --> 00:35:09.280
 We've prevented people from decapitating raccoons.

00:35:09.280 --> 00:35:11.320
 - Although, actually, with the battle that's coming up,

00:35:11.320 --> 00:35:13.480
 we need to decapitate as much as possible.

00:35:13.480 --> 00:35:14.320
 (laughing)

00:35:14.320 --> 00:35:15.160
 That's so right.

00:35:15.160 --> 00:35:18.480
 (upbeat music)

00:35:18.480 --> 00:35:20.840
 - Okay, it's time for our final fact of the show,

00:35:20.840 --> 00:35:22.600
 and that is Andy.

00:35:22.600 --> 00:35:25.680
 - My fact is that the economist, John Maynard Keens,

00:35:25.680 --> 00:35:28.560
 once bought a priceless sizzan painting,

00:35:28.560 --> 00:35:30.520
 and then hid it in a hedge.

00:35:30.520 --> 00:35:31.720
 (laughing)

00:35:31.720 --> 00:35:32.560
 - Very good.

00:35:32.560 --> 00:35:33.720
 - Yeah.

00:35:33.720 --> 00:35:35.840
 - Why did he hide it?

00:35:35.840 --> 00:35:38.360
 - Well, it was a hedge fund, wasn't it?

00:35:38.360 --> 00:35:39.200
 - Brilliant.

00:35:39.200 --> 00:35:40.040
 - You see.

00:35:40.040 --> 00:35:41.240
 - He sees an economist, you see.

00:35:41.240 --> 00:35:43.280
 - The end of that section.

00:35:43.280 --> 00:35:44.440
 (laughing)

00:35:44.440 --> 00:35:46.920
 - So this is a fact from a podcast

00:35:46.920 --> 00:35:48.560
 that's coming out very shortly, actually,

00:35:48.560 --> 00:35:50.920
 and it's by friend of the show,

00:35:50.920 --> 00:35:52.840
 or a few of us know him, Tim Halford,

00:35:52.840 --> 00:35:54.280
 who is the undercover economist,

00:35:54.280 --> 00:35:56.880
 and his new show is called "Cautionary Tales,"

00:35:56.880 --> 00:36:00.240
 and it's all about sort of mishaps, basically.

00:36:00.240 --> 00:36:02.560
 Things that haven't gone to plan, fiasco's,

00:36:02.560 --> 00:36:05.960
 grade A mishaps, you know, this kind of stuff.

00:36:05.960 --> 00:36:09.240
 Oil tankers crashing, and I've seen a bit of it,

00:36:09.240 --> 00:36:11.040
 and it's gonna be an extremely good show.

00:36:11.040 --> 00:36:12.040
 - Oh, it sounds amazing.

00:36:12.040 --> 00:36:14.240
 I mean, it sounds like we're gonna be stealing a lot from it.

00:36:14.240 --> 00:36:15.440
 I mean, look at it, it hasn't even come out.

00:36:15.440 --> 00:36:16.840
 We're ready stealing from it.

00:36:16.840 --> 00:36:17.680
 - Borrowing.

00:36:17.680 --> 00:36:19.480
 - Borrowing, sorry, legally borrowing.

00:36:19.480 --> 00:36:21.680
 - Are we giving this fact back?

00:36:21.680 --> 00:36:22.520
 At the end?

00:36:22.520 --> 00:36:23.360
 (laughing)

00:36:23.360 --> 00:36:24.600
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:36:24.600 --> 00:36:26.200
 So anyway, Tim sent me this fact,

00:36:26.200 --> 00:36:29.440
 and it's about Keens or Keens.

00:36:29.440 --> 00:36:30.280
 - Keens to the right.

00:36:30.280 --> 00:36:31.960
 - There are people say Keens, but I've read Keens online,

00:36:31.960 --> 00:36:34.240
 so I've read Keens, but I think we should say Keens.

00:36:34.240 --> 00:36:35.080
 - All right.

00:36:35.080 --> 00:36:36.520
 - For the wise, no one's gonna know who would take it.

00:36:36.520 --> 00:36:37.520
 (laughing)

00:36:37.520 --> 00:36:40.760
 - And it was in 1918, the first world war was grinding on.

00:36:40.760 --> 00:36:42.440
 He was a bright young economist,

00:36:42.440 --> 00:36:46.920
 and he realized that France's economy was very weak too,

00:36:46.920 --> 00:36:48.320
 and Britain was going to need to collect

00:36:48.320 --> 00:36:50.400
 a massive amount of loan money.

00:36:50.400 --> 00:36:53.920
 And he wanted to buy up artistic masterpieces

00:36:53.920 --> 00:36:56.960
 on behalf of Britain, so then the British government

00:36:56.960 --> 00:36:59.200
 wouldn't need to collect quite as much loan money.

00:36:59.200 --> 00:37:01.560
 Britain would have a lot of new artworks, got it.

00:37:01.560 --> 00:37:04.080
 And also, he felt a bit embarrassed about working

00:37:04.080 --> 00:37:05.720
 for the war effort, 'cause he was quite a Bohemian,

00:37:05.720 --> 00:37:07.920
 he was quite a pacifist, and a lot of his friends

00:37:07.920 --> 00:37:10.920
 had kind of ditched him over his stance in the war.

00:37:10.920 --> 00:37:11.920
 - Oh.

00:37:11.920 --> 00:37:14.360
 - So, he got Charles Holmes, who was the director

00:37:14.360 --> 00:37:16.360
 of the National Gallery on-side,

00:37:16.360 --> 00:37:17.920
 and he found a huge art auction

00:37:17.920 --> 00:37:21.160
 that was happening in Paris, all of Degas' collection

00:37:21.160 --> 00:37:23.960
 was being sold, and they went to the auction.

00:37:23.960 --> 00:37:25.200
 Holmes had shaved his moustache,

00:37:25.200 --> 00:37:26.240
 so he wouldn't be recognized

00:37:26.240 --> 00:37:29.600
 as the director of the National Gallery just in case.

00:37:29.600 --> 00:37:30.920
 And the auction was really quiet,

00:37:30.920 --> 00:37:32.560
 'cause Paris was in the middle of being bombed

00:37:32.560 --> 00:37:34.800
 by Germany at the time of the auction,

00:37:34.800 --> 00:37:36.840
 so not many people turned up.

00:37:36.840 --> 00:37:40.280
 And Holmes bought over 20 masterwork paintings,

00:37:40.280 --> 00:37:42.400
 and they had a sort of blank check from the government,

00:37:42.400 --> 00:37:44.760
 they had 20,000 pounds, which is a huge amount,

00:37:44.760 --> 00:37:47.720
 and Keynes bought himself a seazan,

00:37:47.720 --> 00:37:49.200
 and they traveled back to England,

00:37:49.200 --> 00:37:50.880
 he'd been traveling for 24 hours,

00:37:50.880 --> 00:37:53.400
 and he was visiting his friends in their countryside home,

00:37:53.400 --> 00:37:55.400
 and he was so knackered that he'd just chuck the suitcase

00:37:55.400 --> 00:37:58.760
 in the hedge with his priceless seazan painting in it,

00:37:58.760 --> 00:38:00.040
 and he walked into the house and he said,

00:38:00.040 --> 00:38:02.280
 "There's a seazan in the hedge outside, if you wanna go and look."

00:38:02.280 --> 00:38:04.000
 - So I've been to this house, have you?

00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:09.000
 - Yeah, it's called Charleston, and it's in Sussex.

00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:10.160
 It's very near my in-laws.

00:38:10.160 --> 00:38:11.000
 I went to it recently.

00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:12.960
 It was part of the Bloomsbury group house.

00:38:12.960 --> 00:38:16.120
 It's so Virginia Woolf's sister is who lived there

00:38:16.120 --> 00:38:20.160
 with her artistic friend/lover and his lover.

00:38:20.160 --> 00:38:21.320
 It was a complicated situation.

00:38:21.320 --> 00:38:23.680
 And the house is amazing, it's full of incredible art,

00:38:23.680 --> 00:38:27.960
 like Walter Sickert's original stuff,

00:38:27.960 --> 00:38:30.640
 which I studied because if you remember,

00:38:30.640 --> 00:38:32.520
 there was a theory that he was Jack the Ripper,

00:38:32.520 --> 00:38:34.400
 according to Patricia Cornwall.

00:38:34.400 --> 00:38:36.200
 So I was looking close for clues.

00:38:36.200 --> 00:38:38.480
 - No, it's just normal paintings.

00:38:38.480 --> 00:38:39.960
 - Probably 'cause it's bullshit.

00:38:39.960 --> 00:38:41.600
 - Probably 'cause there's no tree through it,

00:38:41.600 --> 00:38:44.640
 didn't write "I did it" in any of the corners of the pictures.

00:38:44.640 --> 00:38:47.360
 - But no, yeah, so it's an amazing house.

00:38:47.360 --> 00:38:48.640
 I've probably passed the hedge.

00:38:48.640 --> 00:38:49.480
 - So cool.

00:38:49.480 --> 00:38:52.480
 - I'm still a bit confused about why he didn't just bring

00:38:52.480 --> 00:38:54.520
 the suitcase into the house and ask if he could leave it

00:38:54.520 --> 00:38:56.080
 in the entrance or something.

00:38:56.080 --> 00:38:57.960
 - Whenever you come back from holiday,

00:38:57.960 --> 00:38:59.600
 I got all the way to your front door,

00:38:59.600 --> 00:39:00.960
 I got, you know what, I can't be bothered

00:39:00.960 --> 00:39:02.320
 bringing the bag-based locks back,

00:39:02.320 --> 00:39:04.200
 I'm just gonna throw it in the hedge.

00:39:04.200 --> 00:39:06.440
 - It feels like there's something missing from the account

00:39:06.440 --> 00:39:08.640
 'cause it's all from him writing it in from his friends.

00:39:08.640 --> 00:39:10.400
 I think maybe part, it might have been

00:39:10.400 --> 00:39:12.240
 'cause he wanted to make an entrance

00:39:12.240 --> 00:39:13.880
 and say, "Hey, it's me."

00:39:13.880 --> 00:39:16.800
 And I've got a price this bit of art in the hedge.

00:39:16.800 --> 00:39:17.640
 It's not clear.

00:39:17.640 --> 00:39:18.680
 - You don't just all everyone in the house

00:39:18.680 --> 00:39:20.040
 would go, "Why have you been in the hedge, mate?"

00:39:20.040 --> 00:39:21.040
 - Yeah.

00:39:21.040 --> 00:39:22.120
 - And they were in the hedge.

00:39:22.120 --> 00:39:23.120
 - They rushed out.

00:39:23.120 --> 00:39:23.960
 - I bet they did.

00:39:23.960 --> 00:39:24.800
 - Of course it was.

00:39:24.800 --> 00:39:25.640
 - But he did.

00:39:25.640 --> 00:39:26.640
 - 'Cause they wanted to see it

00:39:26.640 --> 00:39:28.200
 and they gathered around it by moonlight.

00:39:28.200 --> 00:39:29.800
 And it was, it was quite nice.

00:39:29.800 --> 00:39:31.520
 The reason he had bought it was because

00:39:31.520 --> 00:39:34.440
 the National Gallery director had refused

00:39:34.440 --> 00:39:37.760
 'cause it was Sizzan, who I think was a post-impressionist,

00:39:37.760 --> 00:39:39.520
 and it was very avant-garde.

00:39:39.520 --> 00:39:41.080
 And it was too avant-garde

00:39:41.080 --> 00:39:42.840
 for the National Gallery to be buying.

00:39:42.840 --> 00:39:44.760
 And home, so I'm not gonna waste my money on this.

00:39:44.760 --> 00:39:46.520
 It's too edgy.

00:39:46.520 --> 00:39:49.720
 And Keens was a bit more out there and he said,

00:39:49.720 --> 00:39:50.840
 "I'll buy it."

00:39:50.840 --> 00:39:51.680
 - Well, yeah.

00:39:51.680 --> 00:39:54.080
 - He was out there for normal society,

00:39:54.080 --> 00:39:56.400
 but then he feels like he was the straight lace one

00:39:56.400 --> 00:39:59.480
 of the Bloom's preset, like he was bridging a gap.

00:39:59.480 --> 00:40:01.800
 I think, 'cause he, but I don't know,

00:40:01.800 --> 00:40:04.240
 he had such a central role in that set of people

00:40:04.240 --> 00:40:05.840
 who were just artists and creatives,

00:40:05.840 --> 00:40:07.920
 which you don't picture Keens being.

00:40:07.920 --> 00:40:10.880
 And so he was there with Wolf and Sack of the West

00:40:10.880 --> 00:40:12.080
 and Ian Forster.

00:40:12.080 --> 00:40:14.800
 And one thing that they were all very relaxed about

00:40:14.800 --> 00:40:16.120
 and I find this really interesting

00:40:16.120 --> 00:40:17.360
 that society was really relaxed about

00:40:17.360 --> 00:40:19.320
 was the fact that he was bisexual

00:40:19.320 --> 00:40:21.520
 and for the first years of his sexual life,

00:40:21.520 --> 00:40:24.360
 he was only had relationships with men.

00:40:24.360 --> 00:40:25.800
 And I find that so bizarre,

00:40:25.800 --> 00:40:28.000
 because he came immediately after Oscar Wilde,

00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:30.200
 who obviously, you know, we know what happened to him.

00:40:30.200 --> 00:40:32.200
 And then immediately before Alan Turing,

00:40:32.200 --> 00:40:34.880
 but there was obviously this relaxation

00:40:34.880 --> 00:40:36.360
 for this 30-year period.

00:40:36.360 --> 00:40:38.040
 And so he was really promiscuous

00:40:38.040 --> 00:40:41.800
 and he had this love triangle with Litton Strati,

00:40:41.800 --> 00:40:45.280
 who then became very jealous of him going out with someone else.

00:40:45.280 --> 00:40:47.280
 And it was Litton Strati who said things like,

00:40:47.280 --> 00:40:50.360
 his common sense is enough to freeze a volcano,

00:40:50.360 --> 00:40:52.120
 which you can really imagine.

00:40:52.120 --> 00:40:55.880
 And he said he hated how he treats his love affairs statistically,

00:40:55.880 --> 00:40:56.840
 which is kind of true.

00:40:56.840 --> 00:40:58.520
 He kept it to the other spreadsheet.

00:40:58.520 --> 00:41:00.160
 He had no cell spreadsheet, didn't he?

00:41:00.160 --> 00:41:01.000
 He did.

00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:03.440
 He wrote, well, it may not have been full on spreadsheet,

00:41:03.440 --> 00:41:06.080
 but he used to record the numbers in his diary,

00:41:06.080 --> 00:41:09.040
 which, you know, if you were just a number in someone's diary,

00:41:09.040 --> 00:41:10.800
 well, I'd be quite proud.

00:41:10.800 --> 00:41:12.200
 It depends on the number, doesn't it?

00:41:12.200 --> 00:41:13.680
 I want to be registered.

00:41:13.680 --> 00:41:17.480
 If it's a scoreboard, then great.

00:41:17.480 --> 00:41:18.480
 They were high numbers.

00:41:18.480 --> 00:41:20.760
 Yeah, didn't he have lots of codes or something

00:41:20.760 --> 00:41:22.840
 for everything that they did?

00:41:22.840 --> 00:41:24.280
 I haven't gotten this written down,

00:41:24.280 --> 00:41:28.440
 but I think he would have sex with someone

00:41:28.440 --> 00:41:31.120
 and then he would have, like, AS for anal sex,

00:41:31.120 --> 00:41:33.560
 or, you know, different things for different things.

00:41:33.560 --> 00:41:37.640
 And then I think he would give people by their initials,

00:41:37.640 --> 00:41:39.920
 but then if it was just a dalliance,

00:41:39.920 --> 00:41:42.960
 it would be bloke in a hedge or, you know,

00:41:42.960 --> 00:41:44.280
 whatever, it's like something.

00:41:44.280 --> 00:41:45.000
 Look at hedge.

00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:47.120
 I apologize about throwing my suitcase onto him.

00:41:47.120 --> 00:41:51.160
 But I think it was that it was, like, there would be no names.

00:41:51.160 --> 00:41:53.920
 It would just be this person in this situation.

00:41:53.920 --> 00:41:55.720
 Yeah, I'd be like, "Bell boy."

00:41:55.720 --> 00:41:58.200
 Yeah, you had the suite of the National Gallery,

00:41:58.200 --> 00:42:01.000
 the soldier of the baths, the French conscript,

00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:03.680
 the lift boy at Voxel.

00:42:03.680 --> 00:42:04.520
 Really?

00:42:04.520 --> 00:42:05.440
 Lift boy at Voxel.

00:42:05.440 --> 00:42:05.960
 Wow.

00:42:05.960 --> 00:42:07.960
 And still no blue plaque at Voxel.

00:42:07.960 --> 00:42:10.160
 Outrageous.

00:42:10.160 --> 00:42:12.600
 He also revolutionized economics.

00:42:12.600 --> 00:42:13.400
 Wow.

00:42:13.400 --> 00:42:16.280
 Which, it's incredible.

00:42:16.280 --> 00:42:19.320
 And he, so he had only studied economics

00:42:19.320 --> 00:42:23.360
 for eight weeks during his student days.

00:42:23.360 --> 00:42:24.480
 He never sat an examiner.

00:42:24.480 --> 00:42:26.560
 He studied classics and maths.

00:42:26.560 --> 00:42:28.760
 And then he only started properly going into it

00:42:28.760 --> 00:42:32.360
 when he was offered a lectureship in economics age 25.

00:42:32.360 --> 00:42:35.440
 And then he just turned up and started revolutionizing the art.

00:42:35.440 --> 00:42:39.320
 And then he almost went bankrupt three times in his life,

00:42:39.320 --> 00:42:42.160
 despite being one of the greatest economists of history.

00:42:42.160 --> 00:42:43.960
 Hey, it was the great depression.

00:42:43.960 --> 00:42:44.960
 That was one of them.

00:42:44.960 --> 00:42:46.440
 You can't blame him for that.

00:42:46.440 --> 00:42:48.000
 But what about the other two, I didn't know.

00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:52.000
 So the first one was when England went to the Golden Standard

00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:54.440
 as in peg the pound with the gold.

00:42:54.440 --> 00:42:56.200
 And he gambled against that happening

00:42:56.200 --> 00:42:57.880
 and lost shit ton of money.

00:42:57.880 --> 00:43:01.040
 And then he speculated against the war.

00:43:01.040 --> 00:43:02.560
 He didn't think the war would happen.

00:43:02.560 --> 00:43:04.440
 And he lost a shit ton of money on that.

00:43:04.440 --> 00:43:07.520
 And then the great depression, which I think we can understand.

00:43:07.520 --> 00:43:09.520
 Actually, I mean all of it, we can kind of understand.

00:43:09.520 --> 00:43:11.040
 But gosh.

00:43:11.040 --> 00:43:12.400
 My gamble.

00:43:12.400 --> 00:43:13.560
 Yeah, he's a gambler.

00:43:13.560 --> 00:43:18.880
 But he got one thing really right, which was about the Treaty of Versailles.

00:43:18.880 --> 00:43:22.320
 So he was present in Versailles as the representative

00:43:22.320 --> 00:43:24.640
 for the treasury, financial rep.

00:43:24.640 --> 00:43:28.840
 And in 1919, he was arguing these compensation payments

00:43:28.840 --> 00:43:30.080
 that you're suggesting Germany makes.

00:43:30.080 --> 00:43:31.680
 They are too high.

00:43:31.680 --> 00:43:33.960
 And this is an insane impulse.

00:43:33.960 --> 00:43:36.760
 And it will lead to disaster in the long run.

00:43:36.760 --> 00:43:38.440
 And he was ignored.

00:43:38.440 --> 00:43:40.160
 He was kind of kept out of the room, actually.

00:43:40.160 --> 00:43:42.080
 And so he was left to try and, you know,

00:43:42.080 --> 00:43:44.240
 he and a couple of other reps were advising around the edges

00:43:44.240 --> 00:43:46.200
 saying this may not work.

00:43:46.200 --> 00:43:48.600
 And he failed, basically, because the impulse to punish Germany

00:43:48.600 --> 00:43:49.400
 was very strong.

00:43:49.400 --> 00:43:50.560
 But he was proved right.

00:43:50.560 --> 00:43:51.680
 Him and Churchill.

00:43:51.680 --> 00:43:53.360
 I feel like Churchill said the same things.

00:43:53.360 --> 00:43:56.440
 They were just outside the room, bitching about a stupid Versailles.

00:43:56.440 --> 00:43:57.120
 Wow.

00:43:57.120 --> 00:43:59.200
 But they were laughing in their faces.

00:43:59.200 --> 00:44:00.280
 20 years later.

00:44:00.280 --> 00:44:02.120
 One thing that he didn't get right was he said,

00:44:02.120 --> 00:44:04.000
 oh, I don't think he's going to get right.

00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:07.440
 As he said, that by 2030, everyone in the Western world

00:44:07.440 --> 00:44:10.920
 will be working a 15-hour work week.

00:44:10.920 --> 00:44:12.000
 Now, this is prediction.

00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:16.280
 If things go really badly wrong, we might be.

00:44:16.280 --> 00:44:19.040
 He thought that only worker-holics would be working more than that.

00:44:19.040 --> 00:44:21.480
 And everyone else progression would get so much

00:44:21.480 --> 00:44:22.840
 that you could do that amount of work

00:44:22.840 --> 00:44:24.640
 and you'd get paid enough that the rest of your time

00:44:24.640 --> 00:44:25.800
 you could be at leisure.

00:44:25.800 --> 00:44:26.920
 Because basically, technology would have

00:44:26.920 --> 00:44:28.760
 been able to do stuff for us.

00:44:28.760 --> 00:44:29.800
 That was his idea, yeah.

00:44:29.800 --> 00:44:32.120
 But why he didn't realize is that as technology goes up,

00:44:32.120 --> 00:44:36.040
 so does the number of people who have to work at that technology.

00:44:36.040 --> 00:44:38.280
 How do robots actually just make more work for us?

00:44:38.280 --> 00:44:38.800
 They do.

00:44:38.800 --> 00:44:39.520
 They do.

00:44:39.520 --> 00:44:40.680
 People don't realize that.

00:44:40.680 --> 00:44:42.160
 Not supposed to happen.

00:44:42.160 --> 00:44:44.120
 But he did think that a very sensible thing,

00:44:44.120 --> 00:44:47.840
 which was that the obsession with money that society has is insane.

00:44:47.840 --> 00:44:50.640
 He thought it was like this crazy social pathology.

00:44:50.640 --> 00:44:52.000
 Because why do you want money?

00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:53.280
 What you want is leisure.

00:44:53.280 --> 00:44:54.840
 What makes humans happy is leisure time.

00:44:54.840 --> 00:44:56.720
 And so he thought, well, we should all be striving towards

00:44:56.720 --> 00:44:59.600
 is that three hours work a day.

00:44:59.600 --> 00:45:01.240
 Then it sounds like a good idea.

00:45:01.240 --> 00:45:02.160
 Does fingers crossed?

00:45:02.160 --> 00:45:06.120
 2030 is still 10 years away, guys.

00:45:06.120 --> 00:45:08.960
 He had this weird thing, just to go about his personal life.

00:45:08.960 --> 00:45:10.160
 Now we've covered the economics.

00:45:10.160 --> 00:45:13.920
 So he had a really lovely marriage, as far as I can tell.

00:45:13.920 --> 00:45:17.880
 He married a ballerina called Lydia Lopperkova, or Lopokava.

00:45:17.880 --> 00:45:19.480
 But he was very confused by this.

00:45:19.480 --> 00:45:21.040
 First, he started falling in love with women

00:45:21.040 --> 00:45:22.400
 and became a bit confused by that.

00:45:22.400 --> 00:45:24.160
 The first woman he fell in love with, he said,

00:45:24.160 --> 00:45:26.200
 "I seem to have fallen in love with Ray a little bit,

00:45:26.200 --> 00:45:28.240
 but as she isn't male, I haven't been able to think

00:45:28.240 --> 00:45:30.760
 of any suitable steps to take."

00:45:30.760 --> 00:45:32.480
 Asked a man in hedge for his opinion.

00:45:32.480 --> 00:45:33.320
 He is also stumped.

00:45:33.320 --> 00:45:37.200
 Wow.

00:45:37.200 --> 00:45:39.840
 He married this ballerina eventually.

00:45:39.840 --> 00:45:44.000
 And he took her on honeymoon to, I think it was Sussex,

00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:46.200
 but he had this honeymoon where he invited some other people.

00:45:46.200 --> 00:45:47.960
 And one of the people he invited was

00:45:47.960 --> 00:45:50.720
 Vickenstein, the philosopher of Vickenstein,

00:45:50.720 --> 00:45:53.320
 who was not that much a laugh to have a honeymoon with him.

00:45:53.320 --> 00:45:57.640
 He sounds really unpleasant.

00:45:57.640 --> 00:46:00.560
 Apparently, he spent the whole six days making her feel like shit.

00:46:00.560 --> 00:46:04.120
 She was a bit lower social class, maybe wasn't intellectual.

00:46:04.120 --> 00:46:06.920
 Yeah, making her feel really stupid.

00:46:06.920 --> 00:46:08.960
 And eventually, she apparently made a remark

00:46:08.960 --> 00:46:10.720
 about how beautiful a tree was.

00:46:10.720 --> 00:46:12.960
 And he said, "What do you mean by that?

00:46:12.960 --> 00:46:15.080
 Challenging her to explain herself."

00:46:15.080 --> 00:46:16.120
 And she just burst into tears.

00:46:16.120 --> 00:46:16.920
 Wow. Wow.

00:46:16.920 --> 00:46:17.920
 And that's what he can't.

00:46:17.920 --> 00:46:24.120
 When Keen's first saw his future wife at the ballet I read,

00:46:24.120 --> 00:46:27.600
 he described her as a rotten dancer with a stiff bottom.

00:46:27.600 --> 00:46:30.920
 It's not very nice, is it?

00:46:30.920 --> 00:46:31.520
 It's not very nice.

00:46:31.520 --> 00:46:32.800
 Although, actually, a stiff bottom.

00:46:32.800 --> 00:46:35.080
 I don't know, that could be nice thing, the stiff bottom.

00:46:35.080 --> 00:46:35.920
 Yeah.

00:46:35.920 --> 00:46:38.040
 Is that so often not when paired with rotten dancer?

00:46:38.040 --> 00:46:38.880
 Oh.

00:46:38.880 --> 00:46:45.880
 I have a couple of art things, just of hidden art.

00:46:45.880 --> 00:46:51.200
 So a few years back, there was a guy who was watching a movie

00:46:51.200 --> 00:46:52.640
 with his daughter.

00:46:52.640 --> 00:46:55.360
 And in it, in the movie, I was watching was Stuart Little.

00:46:55.360 --> 00:46:59.600
 And in the movie, in the background, he noticed this painting

00:46:59.600 --> 00:47:03.960
 that looked suspiciously similar to a lost avant-garde painting

00:47:03.960 --> 00:47:05.160
 that was from Hungary.

00:47:05.160 --> 00:47:08.640
 So sorry, can I just say Stuart Little isn't animated, is it?

00:47:08.640 --> 00:47:11.280
 Stuart Little himself is animated, but the rest of it

00:47:11.280 --> 00:47:12.360
 has got Hugh Laurie.

00:47:12.360 --> 00:47:13.840
 And it's, yeah.

00:47:13.840 --> 00:47:15.680
 Yeah, so in the background of the house that Stuart

00:47:15.680 --> 00:47:16.800
 Lives in is this painting.

00:47:16.800 --> 00:47:18.960
 And he's going, I swear to God, I've seen that painting

00:47:18.960 --> 00:47:19.800
 from somewhere before.

00:47:19.800 --> 00:47:22.680
 And he had a little black and white picture of it.

00:47:22.680 --> 00:47:23.880
 It was 90 years old.

00:47:23.880 --> 00:47:25.640
 And it had been lost for nine decades.

00:47:25.640 --> 00:47:27.400
 And he got in contact with the production.

00:47:27.400 --> 00:47:29.360
 And he said, do you still have this painting?

00:47:29.360 --> 00:47:30.880
 It took two years for them to get back.

00:47:30.880 --> 00:47:34.120
 And eventually, the lady who was in charge of the dressing

00:47:34.120 --> 00:47:36.400
 for the house said, yeah, I found it at some market.

00:47:36.400 --> 00:47:37.760
 I bought it for nothing.

00:47:37.760 --> 00:47:40.440
 And they've now established that this is the lost work

00:47:40.440 --> 00:47:43.160
 of an artist called Robert Burrani.

00:47:43.160 --> 00:47:46.320
 It does two years to reply to an email.

00:47:46.320 --> 00:47:48.280
 It was a very successful film Stuart Little.

00:47:48.280 --> 00:47:50.960
 And they had a sequel to reply to it.

00:47:50.960 --> 00:47:52.200
 They had a sequel to make.

00:47:52.200 --> 00:47:54.120
 It makes me feel a lot better about my email.

00:47:54.120 --> 00:47:58.120
 So that is the main takeaway for me as well.

00:47:58.120 --> 00:48:00.320
 Yeah, crazy.

00:48:00.320 --> 00:48:04.920
 There was another incident in 2008, where a Norman Rockwell painting,

00:48:04.920 --> 00:48:06.680
 really famous for Norman Rockwell painting,

00:48:06.680 --> 00:48:08.960
 was found hidden behind a false wall.

00:48:08.960 --> 00:48:12.000
 And this was, it was worth $15.4 million.

00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:14.520
 And the reason that had happened, it was this weird story.

00:48:14.520 --> 00:48:17.320
 So it was really famous because it had been on the cover

00:48:17.320 --> 00:48:19.040
 of magazine in the '50s.

00:48:19.040 --> 00:48:23.360
 And it was bought by a cartoonist called Don Tract Junior.

00:48:23.360 --> 00:48:26.280
 And he just bought it for $900 in 1960.

00:48:26.280 --> 00:48:29.720
 And he sort of displayed it people thought for years afterwards.

00:48:29.720 --> 00:48:31.320
 People would come around and be like, oh yeah,

00:48:31.320 --> 00:48:33.040
 Don's got that great picture.

00:48:33.040 --> 00:48:35.520
 And people were a bit confused because when they look closely

00:48:35.520 --> 00:48:39.080
 at the one he had, it didn't match up with the magazine cover.

00:48:39.080 --> 00:48:40.200
 So a bit odd.

00:48:40.200 --> 00:48:43.840
 Anyway, he died a few years ago, 2008 or 2007.

00:48:43.840 --> 00:48:45.960
 And his sons went through his home.

00:48:45.960 --> 00:48:48.800
 They discovered an entire false wall they'd had built.

00:48:48.800 --> 00:48:51.280
 And behind it was the real painting.

00:48:51.280 --> 00:48:55.200
 And he'd painted a copy of that to show to the public.

00:48:55.200 --> 00:48:58.200
 And his son's theory about why he'd hidden the original

00:48:58.200 --> 00:49:01.800
 is because he disliked his wife and he then divorced so much

00:49:01.800 --> 00:49:03.560
 that he was worried she would take it.

00:49:03.560 --> 00:49:05.040
 Wow, how did it?

00:49:05.040 --> 00:49:07.760
 Oh my god, that's a lot to do, isn't it?

00:49:07.760 --> 00:49:09.800
 That is a lot, it's incredible.

00:49:09.800 --> 00:49:14.040
 In '50s or '50s, Leonardo did a fresco.

00:49:14.040 --> 00:49:16.920
 We're just first naming Leonardo, aren't we?

00:49:16.920 --> 00:49:20.560
 Oh, sorry, Leonardo DiCaprio.

00:49:20.560 --> 00:49:22.880
 Leonardo da Vinci made this fresco.

00:49:22.880 --> 00:49:26.200
 And it was in the grand meeting hall of Florence's Palazzo

00:49:26.200 --> 00:49:27.840
 Betio, okay.

00:49:27.840 --> 00:49:30.440
 And then the Medici's came along and they decided,

00:49:30.440 --> 00:49:33.200
 "I don't really like that, I want something else in that place."

00:49:33.200 --> 00:49:36.040
 So they commissioned the architect Giordio Vassari

00:49:36.040 --> 00:49:39.280
 to renovate the room and to put something else in its place,

00:49:39.280 --> 00:49:41.360
 which means that we've lost that fresco.

00:49:41.360 --> 00:49:44.880
 But we know that Vassari was a big fan of Leonardo.

00:49:44.880 --> 00:49:48.280
 And so we think that he probably wouldn't have destroyed it.

00:49:48.280 --> 00:49:50.040
 And in that room, if you go there now,

00:49:50.040 --> 00:49:52.360
 there are two words painted in the whole room.

00:49:52.360 --> 00:49:56.920
 And they are "serts a trover," which means "seek and you shall find."

00:49:56.920 --> 00:49:58.800
 And we know that at another time,

00:49:58.800 --> 00:50:01.880
 he has, in another time, put a fake wall in place

00:50:01.880 --> 00:50:04.320
 to hide something that he didn't want to damage.

00:50:04.320 --> 00:50:06.160
 So we think that somewhere in that room,

00:50:06.160 --> 00:50:09.040
 there might be Leonardo's lost fresco.

00:50:09.040 --> 00:50:10.280
 Wow.

00:50:10.280 --> 00:50:11.680
 How hard is it to search a room?

00:50:11.680 --> 00:50:14.320
 Well, yeah, but I guess if he's got art on the wall,

00:50:14.320 --> 00:50:15.120
 he's painted his own--

00:50:15.120 --> 00:50:16.120
 He's painted his own fresco.

00:50:16.120 --> 00:50:17.080
 He's got a good painting.

00:50:17.080 --> 00:50:19.280
 Yeah, just tear it down.

00:50:19.280 --> 00:50:20.920
 Yeah, I guess Leonardo.

00:50:20.920 --> 00:50:23.360
 Apparently, and I'm quoting this from the article I read it,

00:50:23.360 --> 00:50:26.040
 it says, "Excavation has been tangled for years

00:50:26.040 --> 00:50:29.240
 in the famously convoluted Italian bureaucracy."

00:50:29.240 --> 00:50:31.360
 It's actually the people who worked on Stuart Little,

00:50:31.360 --> 00:50:34.120
 who were in charge of this renovation.

00:50:34.120 --> 00:50:35.640
 How many fake walls are going to help?

00:50:35.640 --> 00:50:38.440
 These are going to be tiny rooms eventually.

00:50:38.440 --> 00:50:39.440
 You're right.

00:50:39.440 --> 00:50:42.160
 I'm sure it used to be able to fit the dining room table in here.

00:50:42.160 --> 00:50:49.720
 I've got a fact about war art and art being hidden in times of war.

00:50:49.720 --> 00:50:52.080
 So the second world war, I think we may have mentioned before

00:50:52.080 --> 00:50:53.520
 that all the art in the National Gallery

00:50:53.520 --> 00:50:55.560
 was sent to a cave in Wales.

00:50:55.560 --> 00:50:56.320
 Yeah.

00:50:56.320 --> 00:51:00.320
 And by the end of the war, it was the most high-tech cave

00:51:00.320 --> 00:51:02.960
 in the world, because they built a railway inside the cave

00:51:02.960 --> 00:51:04.040
 to move all the art around.

00:51:04.040 --> 00:51:05.040
 It was cool.

00:51:05.040 --> 00:51:07.120
 And I really like how it got there.

00:51:07.120 --> 00:51:09.440
 So the paintings were sent in post office vans

00:51:09.440 --> 00:51:13.520
 and Cadbury delivery tracks to avoid attracting attention to them.

00:51:13.520 --> 00:51:14.200
 Oh, wow.

00:51:14.200 --> 00:51:16.680
 So I can't think of anything that would be attracted to bar

00:51:16.680 --> 00:51:19.760
 and driving through my village in Wales.

00:51:19.760 --> 00:51:20.560
 And you're right.

00:51:20.560 --> 00:51:23.040
 Well, suddenly hundreds of Cadbury delivery trucks are driving through.

00:51:23.040 --> 00:51:25.080
 In the war, when chocolate was rationed--

00:51:25.080 --> 00:51:26.640
 Exactly.

00:51:26.640 --> 00:51:29.040
 But there's one painting, which gave them such problems.

00:51:29.040 --> 00:51:33.000
 So it's by Van Dyke, and it's a portrait of Charles I, right?

00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:34.240
 And it's a biggie.

00:51:34.240 --> 00:51:39.240
 It's 12 feet by 9 1/2 feet, and it's on a truck.

00:51:39.240 --> 00:51:41.480
 So I presume that was wrapped up.

00:51:41.480 --> 00:51:45.360
 But there was a very, very tight bend in the road

00:51:45.360 --> 00:51:46.920
 just before they get to the thing.

00:51:46.920 --> 00:51:48.840
 So there's no other way of getting there.

00:51:48.840 --> 00:51:50.080
 Very tight bend in the road.

00:51:50.080 --> 00:51:54.000
 And at that same point, there's a railway bridge over the road.

00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:56.640
 And they calculated it would be possible to do it.

00:51:56.640 --> 00:51:59.720
 But you'd have to pivot really--

00:51:59.720 --> 00:52:00.720
 Pivot?

00:52:00.720 --> 00:52:02.360
 Pivot really carefully.

00:52:02.360 --> 00:52:04.120
 And they didn't want to take the risk.

00:52:04.120 --> 00:52:07.040
 So the way they solved it was they took up

00:52:07.040 --> 00:52:09.400
 the surface of the road.

00:52:09.400 --> 00:52:11.040
 They just destroyed the surface of the road

00:52:11.040 --> 00:52:12.880
 to get several more inches of clearance.

00:52:12.880 --> 00:52:13.600
 Wow.

00:52:13.600 --> 00:52:14.360
 I know.

00:52:14.360 --> 00:52:16.760
 They just-- because it was such an important piece of art.

00:52:16.760 --> 00:52:18.720
 And if you go there now, you can see,

00:52:18.720 --> 00:52:20.880
 at the point where the bridge is, the curb

00:52:20.880 --> 00:52:22.520
 is really high above the road.

00:52:22.520 --> 00:52:24.120
 Because the road is several inches there.

00:52:24.120 --> 00:52:25.120
 Oh, it's still there.

00:52:25.120 --> 00:52:26.120
 I'd love to know where that is.

00:52:26.120 --> 00:52:27.280
 That's amazing.

00:52:27.280 --> 00:52:30.200
 Which van Dyke, who are we talking about?

00:52:30.200 --> 00:52:32.120
 Van Dyke.

00:52:32.120 --> 00:52:34.640
 Yes, Dick Van Dyke and Leonardo DiCaprio,

00:52:34.640 --> 00:52:39.080
 the two famous Renaissance artists.
