00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:07.120
 Hi everyone, James here. Welcome to this week's episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, where myself,

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:14.000
 Andrew and Dan Shriver are joined by none other than our very, very, very good friend and colleague,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.840
 Ann Miller. Now you all know Ann, she's been on the podcast many, many times, but the one very

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:26.640
 important thing to tell you about her today is that she has a brand new book out. That book is

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:33.520
 called Mickey and the Trouble with Moles. It is an amazing children's book all about this secret

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:38.400
 group of animal spies. And the amazing thing about this book, well actually two really cool

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:43.920
 things about this book. Number one, there are secret codes hidden in the book that you can solve

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:50.320
 while you're reading it. And number two, even more excitingly for me, I have a cameo in it.

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:58.720
 Page 106, I'll admit, it's not a huge cameo. It's just one of the characters alludes to someone

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:04.640
 called James. But I am assured by Ann that that refers to me. So this is very exciting for me,

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:09.840
 the first time I have ever been in a work in fiction. But guys, honestly, I can't tell you

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.640
 enough how great this book is. It's called Mickey and the Trouble with Moles. Stephen Fry said of

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:20.800
 this series of books, they're brilliantly funny, ingenious and deliciously addictive. And if that

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:26.240
 doesn't sell you on them, I don't know what will. Apart from hearing Ann on this week's episode of

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:35.200
 Fish. So with no more ado, it is time for this week's No Such Thing as a Fish. On with the podcast.

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:56.160
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming to you

00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:02.400
 from four undisclosed locations in the UK. My name is Dan Schreiber. I am sitting here with James

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:07.920
 Harkin, Andrew Hunter Murray and Ann Miller. And once again, we have gathered around the microphones

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:13.440
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days. And in no particular order here we go.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:20.080
 Starting with fact number one, and that is Ann. My fact is that Moles burrows have special

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:24.240
 kitchens where they keep up to 470 decapitated earthworms to eat later.

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:32.080
 470. It's very specific. That's the most they found. There could be more. We just...

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:34.640
 It's absolutely, it's like a giant larder, right? Yeah.

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:39.360
 Where they can go into for a nighttime snack. Yeah, they need to eat a lot. So they eat about

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:44.320
 60% of their body weight and worms every day. And their burrows are really intricate. They have

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:47.760
 special rooms for sleeping, for giving birth, and for storing their food. So it's kind of like

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:53.120
 having a kitchen or a larder or a pantry. But it's, well, it's not to my taste, but it works for them.

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:58.720
 Yeah, I think 470 is quite a lot though. It's like they're panic bought earthworms, isn't it?

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:04.000
 Yeah, that's pandemic purchasing, isn't it? They know some of it's going on. Hang on.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.480
 They've got special rooms for giving birth in. They can't use those very often.

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:13.760
 Well, we have those as well, Andy. And we, and you wouldn't put earthworms in the same room, Andy.

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:17.760
 It's very health and safety problematic. Completely, completely, completely. But all I'm

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:21.680
 saying is that if you've only got a certain number of rooms in your home. Oh, but they've got loads.

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:27.760
 Yeah. Oh, okay. To have a specific maternity unit room in your house. I don't have that in

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:33.440
 my house. I've got a kitchen and a living room and a bedroom. But if you were a mall, like so malls

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:37.440
 can dig up to 20 meters of tunnel a day. So you've got a whole borough of them and they're all digging.

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:40.400
 You could probably add an extension on pretty quick. Whereas if you're adding it to your house,

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:44.240
 Andy, imagine it would take you more than a day or two probably. Yeah. Especially if it was just you.

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:49.760
 The neighbors would have a few issues, no doubt. I love the way that they catch the worms. One of

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:56.080
 the ways they do it is they dig a tunnel and the worms just fall into it. That's how they get so

00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:01.520
 many. Just wait for it. Of course. Exactly. Imagine you're a worm just kind of going around your

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:06.400
 daily business sort of burrowing in the soil and suddenly just fall into a massive hole of your

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:10.960
 enemy. And then you get put in a larder with all your dead friends. You see all your friends say,

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:16.080
 yeah. But here's a quick question. So I was reading that they stored the worms and there was a

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:21.040
 suggestion in what I read is that they've immobilized the worms with a bite to the head. So they're

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:26.560
 still alive. They're not dead yet. They may be brain dead, but they're sort of fresh because

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:31.520
 they're still living. So is that right? They're not actually dead in that larder. Yeah. I think it's

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:36.720
 more, it's kind of like putting them in a fridge, but it's like a living fridge. Yes. So the worms

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:40.800
 aren't going to go off. They can eat them later, but they also can't get away. It's very good. I

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:46.000
 think they can get paralyzed by, like you say, I think they can get paralyzed by being bitten at

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:51.280
 the back of the head, which kind of stops them being able to wriggle around. But I think that

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:56.320
 moles might also be kind of poisonous or venomous as well. There's stuff in their saliva. I think

00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:00.000
 there's many different types of moles, but yeah, I think there's saliva can do stuff as well. I think

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:05.200
 that's right. And I think shrews are the same. And there's this kind of toxin called blarina toxin,

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:10.320
 especially in shrews, but I think in moles as well. And if they bite humans as well,

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:15.920
 then you can get a little bit of a bit like a bee sting or a wasp sting. You might get a bit of

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:21.520
 swelling around. So they are quite, you know, they're venomous. Well, just on being bitten by moles,

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:28.160
 moles are really, really strong. And there was a belief in the 18th century that if you held a

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:32.800
 mole in your hand until it died, your hand would acquire healing power, right? Okay, so if you

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:38.240
 just kind of cup it in your hands. Now, the problem is they're so strong. There's a mole expert called

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:42.640
 Mark Hamer, and I read an interview with him. And he said that moles are stronger than people.

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:47.040
 He said that if you picked up a mole and help, yeah, don't shake your head, James. It's true.

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:52.400
 If you pick up a mole and cup it between your hands, even if you are really strong, like even

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:55.920
 if you're a manual labor or something, it will be able to burst open your hands and get that.

00:05:55.920 --> 00:06:01.120
 I know what you mean, Andy, but I don't want to be one of those 7% of men who think they could

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:05.680
 beat an elephant in a fight. But I do think that I might be able to beat a mole in a fight.

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:09.600
 But well, you'd have a really hard time finding one, though, because we very rarely see moles,

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:13.680
 because they're pretty fast and they're mostly underground. And actually, in 1967, there was

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:17.440
 a guy called Peter Stafford, who won the World Life Camera Man of the Year Prize. He took a photo

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:21.920
 of some mole and it's young in a burrow. And for 40 years, that was the only photo we had of moles

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:27.760
 in their burrow with their young. And then the reason they got changed was in 2012, Springwatch

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:31.200
 were like, well, this is a challenge, let's film the moles. But they got Peter Stafford back to

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:35.200
 help them do it. So he is like the guy for filming moles in their burrows. They're very mysterious.

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:43.120
 Have you guys heard of Mollology? No. So this is a thing that's been coined by a guy called

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:49.360
 Jesper Ehrman. And he's an archaeologist who basically made an application to the Danish

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:55.680
 cultural agency to say we want to use moles to help us do our archaeological digs. And the idea

00:06:55.680 --> 00:07:00.880
 was that if you have moles burrowing down into potential sites where you believe there to be

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:06.720
 hidden cities, in the digging, the stuff that comes to the surface might have shards of pottery or have

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:13.680
 little elements of these bits of archaeological brick or whatever. And so he's dubbed it Mollology.

00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:19.120
 And they do the work for him. So they don't have to sort of desecrate the area and potentially ruin

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:24.640
 ancient sites. Do they not think that like ancient Egyptians were just all eating earthworms and

00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:32.080
 stuff? Is that? But that's happening in the UK as well. There are moles basically working at a

00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:35.360
 site in Cumbria. It's an old Roman forge that's protected. So you're not allowed to dig there

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:42.080
 if you're a human. Moles are not bound by such rules. And so there are a whole team of human

00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:45.760
 volunteers whose job it is is to go through the molehills and find out what they've basically

00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:50.080
 turfed up as they're digging. And so far the moles have found pottery, beads and my favourite,

00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:54.320
 a decorative bronze dolphin, which makes me think they're like, I'm not putting that in my burrow.

00:07:54.320 --> 00:08:04.240
 Send that up. That's really good. Yeah, I prefer their original name sort of circa 450 to 1100 AD.

00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:08.640
 And well, you're very old school then. Yeah, and I would appreciate it if for the rest of this

00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:12.960
 segment we could refer to them by their original name, which was and it's very nice. The idea, Andy,

00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:17.840
 as you say, of holding a mole in your hand because they used to be called wands. Oh, you had a wand.

00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:27.440
 Yeah, W-A-N-D. And a wand eventually turned into a wand. So they became a wand. And the molehills

00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:32.880
 used to be called a wanty-tump. They were not called that. Damn, was that? Back in the day,

00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:39.520
 you would be making a mountain out of a wanty-tump. All right. That's fantastic. Let their name before

00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:44.240
 they were cool as well. Dan's got the original molehill data. Another thing about moles is they

00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:48.240
 got really fast reactions. So the star nose mole actually has the Guinness World Record for being

00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:53.760
 the fastest eater on the planet. So it can basically locate a snack, eat it, and then move on to looking

00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:59.600
 for its next one in 230 milliseconds. The average, the fastest one was 120 milliseconds. And for a

00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:05.440
 comparison, it takes humans 650 milliseconds to respond to a red light traffic light. So they

00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:11.120
 are fast. They are fast. They look insane, by the way. If you've never seen a star nose mole,

00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:15.920
 give it a Google. It's the most alien-looking creature. It's a sort of, it's like it's halfway

00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:20.640
 through eating an octopus, and it's just stopped with the legs hanging out. That's what's on its

00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:27.520
 face. The rest of it's very mole-like and then suddenly alien on the face. It's very magical,

00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:34.880
 actually. That organ on the front of their face is 12 times more sensitive than a human clitoris.

00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:44.960
 Wow. I don't know what to say about that. And it's a lot easier to find as well.

00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:55.440
 That's so good. Oh, so, mole-catching. I'm sure you guys have been reading about the massive

00:09:55.440 --> 00:10:01.200
 feud in the British mole-catching community. Okay. No, I don't like this. There are three

00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:06.720
 British bodies. It's so stereotypically British, devoted to catching moles. There's an association

00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:10.880
 of British mole-catchers, there's the British mole-catchers register, and there's the guild of

00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:17.200
 British mole-catchers. Splitters. Well, they had this huge feud in 2016 because Anne Chippendale,

00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:23.840
 which is the name of the woman who is in the association of pro-mole-catchers, she accused

00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:29.440
 Louise Chapman, who's the head of the British register of mole-catchers, of being an embarrassment,

00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:33.280
 in quotes. This all happened in the pages of the Wall Street Journal for no good reason.

00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:36.640
 No idea why. Not the Mole Street Journal.

00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:41.600
 Why? I think I've got better things to report on. Clearly, they just wanted a bit of sort of

00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:45.760
 exotic colour from weird backwards Britain, and so they just wrote about this mad feud they were

00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:50.240
 all having. And there's this huge debate about whether you should check a mole trap every day,

00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:53.920
 because that's more humane, or whether you should check it only a few days, which is, you know,

00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:57.520
 could leave a mole in distress, but might also, you know, you've got to drive 50 miles to get

00:10:57.520 --> 00:11:03.600
 to your next bloody trap. And so there are there are ructions in official pro-mole-catching circles

00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:09.520
 at the moment. Wow. Yeah. Wow. I'm not actually a member of any of those. I prefer the underground

00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:19.360
 stuff. Well, you are going for it, James. Look, I've been away for a week. I feel like if I don't,

00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:25.120
 then you guys are going to replace me with Jamie full-time. Speaking of Anne said earlier that

00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:30.880
 they had really good reactions. And that's why we have the thing called Whack-a-Mole. That game,

00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:37.040
 you know, where the moles kind of pop up and then you whack them. So this was invented in Japan in

00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:46.160
 the 1970s. It was called Magura Taiji in Japan. And in 1976 and 1977, it was the second highest

00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:51.840
 grossing mechanical arcade game in both of those years. It was absolutely massive. It was huge.

00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:56.400
 Really? And for people who don't know it, the moles pop up like these little furry things,

00:11:56.400 --> 00:12:00.240
 then you hit them with a mallet. And every time you hit them, you get a point and then they drop

00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:07.920
 back down into their holes. But a lot of people in video game academic circles refer to Whack-a-Mole

00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:14.160
 as the first violent video game, basically. So, you know, when you're talking about how maybe

00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:19.120
 Grand Theft Auto is turning us all into, you know, carjackers and stuff, they really can

00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:22.720
 shake it all the way back to Whack-a-Mole, which was the first of these games.

00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:26.000
 Right. That's really interesting. I've played Whack-a-Mole like at a seaside,

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:31.040
 fairly recently, obviously not in the last year or so. But it wasn't moles. It's always like sort of

00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:34.880
 cylinders that sort of pop up. So maybe that was an attempt to sort of separate it from

00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:37.840
 cruelly bashing the moles, even though it's still called Whack-a-Mole.

00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:42.560
 I think maybe it was. Because if you think about it, like, you know, Whacking moles,

00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:48.320
 people say, oh, video games, they don't make you do that. But there are three societies in Britain

00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:52.560
 dedicated to catching moles. So that's evidence for you straight away.

00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:55.600
 I think we need a follow-up of which arcades they visited as children.

00:12:55.600 --> 00:13:02.320
 But yeah, there are some others like Whack-a-Banker and Whack-a-warden, kind of like new versions

00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:07.280
 of them where you can attack some people with unpopular jobs in the future.

00:13:07.280 --> 00:13:15.840
 Right. The Versailles Palace in France, famously, has its own mole catcher and it has had for 330

00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:21.840
 years. Okay. Well, they certainly had in 2012, which was when I read an interview with the Versailles

00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:27.120
 catcher, Jerome Dormion. And he signs off all his text messages with 'Mole Catcher to the King',

00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:32.240
 completely ignoring the fact France no longer has kings. They literally dealt with that situation.

00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:36.480
 But basically, Versailles obviously is so neat. The gardens are so pristine and the

00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:40.480
 lawns are so gorgeous that he has to keep 2,000 acres free of moles.

00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:43.440
 How does he do it? Does he have like a little mole guillotine or?

00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:46.480
 Genuinely, he uses a guillotine style trap. No.

00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:48.880
 Genuinely, he actually does. Wow.

00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:53.360
 And he is very lucky to be in his work because in the old days, he wouldn't have had a chance

00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:58.880
 because from the 1600s until 1812, all the mole catchers came from the Liard family,

00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:04.080
 all the royal mole catchers. And there's a story that the last one was a bit of a rake,

00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:09.040
 bit of a scallywag and basically turned the official mole catchers residence at Versailles

00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:15.440
 into, you know, a knocking shop. It was a brothel. And one day, as Napoleon was walking in the

00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:21.840
 gardens at Versailles, a prostitute came out of the mole catcher's house and propositioned him

00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:26.880
 and said, "All right, bone apart, fancy a good time." And as a result, the family was stripped

00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:30.960
 of its ancient privilege after 150 years of mole catching. Wow.

00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:34.960
 Yeah. What a rollercoaster. What a mole coaster.

00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:41.840
 What a way to lose your family inheritance of so many years though, just one prostitute.

00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:45.040
 Every time someone asked you to repeat the story as well, you'd get the full name. It was something

00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:50.320
 cooler. So I really love reading about moles, but also obviously there's moles in the human

00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:54.640
 world. But in terms of the word mole, meaning a double agent, that pretty much comes from John

00:14:54.640 --> 00:15:00.000
 Le Carré's books. And he has sort of said like some of the words he took from the world of espionage

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.360
 and some of them he made up himself. And there's a bit of confusion over which ones are which,

00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:06.000
 because obviously things are secret and which things are coincidences and which

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:10.400
 things are definite. But according to the Oxford English Dictionary, they basically say it was

00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:15.440
 very rare to use it. I mean espionage before the Cold War saw writings and they cite John

00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:20.720
 Le Carré as one of the very first people to use that. And as well as coming up with the word

00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:25.440
 mole, he also came up with honey trap that came from Le Carré. That wasn't something we used

00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:30.480
 before. And he also had to run the past any character names, had to run them past the foreign

00:15:30.480 --> 00:15:34.800
 office to make sure he didn't accidentally dobbin any real active agents, which I thought was

00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:37.920
 kind of cool. And then in the BBC interview, they asked him if he did the same thing with

00:15:37.920 --> 00:15:42.800
 Dragan and he was sort of like, no, but I try and you know, I have more fun making up my own words.

00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:49.040
 Well, so Anne, you've written a couple of kids books about espionage in the animal world. Did

00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:53.520
 you have to run and you've got friends in GCHQ, I know that happened to know that. So did you have

00:15:53.520 --> 00:16:00.160
 to run those names past the? I'm not allowed to comment on that. And is there a honey trap in

00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:06.720
 your book? No, there is not. It's for children. Okay, cool. It could be an actual trap of honey.

00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:17.840
 If you're trying to trap Winnie the Pooh, for example. Okay, it is time for fact number two,

00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:24.800
 and that is Andy. My fact is that in 1800, a wig maker in London patented mechanical whiskers.

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:33.120
 Great. Yeah, amazing. Are we talking cat or human? Human, which is nice. Oh, yeah, not the cat food.

00:16:33.120 --> 00:16:39.200
 No, not the cat food. God, this is a semantic nightmare, this one. Basically, this is from an

00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:46.240
 article by an expert on beard and wig history, a guy called Alan Withey, who discovered in his

00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:54.080
 researches a patent that a London wig maker had taken out. And it was in a time when beards were

00:16:54.080 --> 00:16:58.160
 reasonably fashionable. They hadn't had huge heights, which was later on in Victorian times,

00:16:58.160 --> 00:17:02.480
 you know, the mid-19th century. This is the year 1800. But there was a London wig maker who had

00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:07.280
 made a contraption, or patented at least, a contraption, which had fastenings made of a certain

00:17:07.280 --> 00:17:13.120
 elastic compressed steel or springs. It was basically so you could attach a beard to your face with

00:17:13.120 --> 00:17:19.360
 metal and make it look really convincing. Yeah, it would make it kind of almost flap a little bit

00:17:19.360 --> 00:17:26.160
 in the weather. Well, that was the worry, wasn't it? Because people who were obsessing with trying

00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:30.320
 to wear fake beards were taping them to their face or gluing them. And if a big gust came,

00:17:30.320 --> 00:17:36.400
 their beard would fly off mid chat and suddenly a naked face would be talking to everyone. And

00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:43.520
 that would not be seen as a good thing. I spoke to Dr. Withey this morning and what a great guy he is.

00:17:43.520 --> 00:17:48.160
 And he said that it was almost like you could buy this wig and then it came with like optional

00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:54.480
 extras. And so he said that the mechanical whiskers were almost like the go-faster stripes of the

00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:59.600
 wig world. So you would buy your normal car, but you would add the go-faster stripes or you'd buy

00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:04.960
 your normal wig and you would get these extras that went alongside it. Cool, right. That's so cool.

00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:09.520
 He's an amazing guy. I'm so excited that you got to talk to him because his website,

00:18:09.520 --> 00:18:14.320
 his blog on beards, and he's got a book out as well. It's just fantastic. And one of the best

00:18:14.320 --> 00:18:21.040
 things about him is a man obsessed with beards. He doesn't have a beard. Well done. I spoke to him

00:18:21.040 --> 00:18:25.840
 on FaceTime today and I can tell you that he does have a beard though. Well, he's buckled then.

00:18:25.840 --> 00:18:32.480
 He's buckled. Well, during lockdown, decided to grow a little beard. Fair and nice. Looks very cool.

00:18:32.480 --> 00:18:38.080
 What kind has he got James? Well, for him, like during lockdown, the rest of his hair kind of fell

00:18:38.080 --> 00:18:43.920
 out. He doesn't know why, but the one, the bit that's left is kind of a mustache with a goatee

00:18:43.920 --> 00:18:51.440
 beard at the bottom. Okay. By the way, his website, we should just say it is Dr. Allen. It's Allen

00:18:51.440 --> 00:18:58.240
 spelled the Welsh way. So that's A-L-U-N-D-R-A-L-U-N dot wordpress.com. And like Dan said, it is an

00:18:58.240 --> 00:19:02.880
 amazing website with everything you would ever want to know about beards. It's incredible. Yes.

00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:08.640
 So does he have his beard if it's a mustache with just the goatee bit at the bottom? Is that a bit

00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:14.400
 like Iron Man's, you know, Robert Downey Jr. Is it like that? So not like yours, James, connected.

00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:19.600
 Yeah, I think that's right, although I can't obviously remember people's faces.

00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:25.600
 James has a, for the listener, James can't remember any faces. So I'm questioning this whole

00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:29.760
 Dan, you're just like, because you've been scooped on your return.

00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:38.240
 But that's supposedly called an anchor, that type of beard. And I think James, you have a goatee

00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:43.600
 which the way you have it, that might be a circle called the circle beard. Is that right? Yeah,

00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:48.480
 there's so many different types. And he brings up all these old types from the 19th century,

00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:54.080
 particularly, you know, some beards were called soup strainers and others thai ticklers and the

00:19:54.080 --> 00:19:59.520
 Piccadilly weepers. But I obviously, I don't know if you can tell this is a video call. I currently

00:19:59.520 --> 00:20:03.600
 have not got a beard, but apparently in the 1800s, it was also quite fashionable for women to fasten

00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:08.000
 their hair under their chin to imitate the look. So I might try that next time I'm hitting shops,

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:12.960
 see if it goes down well. Exactly. I spoke to Alan with you about this and he said that he found a

00:20:12.960 --> 00:20:20.320
 few kind of advertisements for women to buy hair products for their beards, but they were usually

00:20:20.320 --> 00:20:25.600
 like, you got ringlets instead of sideburns, they would kind of get those growing down or sometimes

00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:31.040
 would even draw whiskers onto their faces because they wanted to follow the latest fashion. I mean,

00:20:31.040 --> 00:20:36.160
 it must have been an amazing time, maybe the best time ever for beard owners, the 19th century,

00:20:36.160 --> 00:20:42.480
 because people just went tonto for them. So the really big era of beard fashion was kind of that

00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:47.120
 middle of the century. And supposedly, it was starting with Crimea, the Crimean War, soldiers

00:20:47.120 --> 00:20:52.880
 grew beards, because it was very, very cold. And he just wanted a little bit of, you know, facial

00:20:52.880 --> 00:20:58.640
 protection. So that then all the obviously 1856 Crimean war ends, soldiers come home, they're

00:20:58.640 --> 00:21:02.800
 conquering here. Well, I can't remember who won the Crimean War. Anyway, soldiers go home,

00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:09.600
 that's the main point. And they've all got beards. And that's an argument. There's a book from 1854

00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:16.400
 actually called The Philosophy of Beards, which said that beards could keel sore throats, or that

00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:20.080
 if you shaved off a beard, you might get rheumatism and lots of other ailments because you don't

00:21:20.080 --> 00:21:26.880
 have this protection anymore. I read that book for a little while. And it's not the whole thing.

00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:31.680
 Alan with these read the whole thing, I'm sure. And the author of this book says,

00:21:31.680 --> 00:21:37.440
 you might be thinking, why don't women have beards? If beards are so great, and the author is saying

00:21:37.440 --> 00:21:42.320
 beards are really, really great. Yeah. And he wrote, well, look, women naturally have longer hair,

00:21:42.320 --> 00:21:47.920
 but also women were never intended to be exposed to the hardships and difficulties men are called

00:21:47.920 --> 00:21:53.840
 upon to undergo. So I think the idea is that, you know, the men are out hunting mastodonts or whatever

00:21:53.840 --> 00:21:57.360
 it is, men are out hunting. And you need a beard to hide behind if there's no bushes or anything.

00:21:57.360 --> 00:22:01.280
 Exactly. Exactly. Love this as a man who clearly hasn't heard of a scar.

00:22:01.280 --> 00:22:08.480
 There is a theory that came out quite recently, isn't there, that beards evolved so that if people

00:22:08.480 --> 00:22:16.480
 punch you, it kind of lessens the force. Do you see that? That's amazing. So this was quite a recent

00:22:16.480 --> 00:22:22.400
 study. And the scientists, what they did was they took a skull. And obviously you can't get a skull

00:22:22.400 --> 00:22:26.960
 with a beard because it's a bit late for growing a beard by the time you're a skull. You can't

00:22:26.960 --> 00:22:31.920
 really do it. And so what they did was they took a load of hair from a sheep and then wrapped it

00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:39.680
 around the skull to kind of be almost as if it's a bit like a beard. And then they pummeled the skull

00:22:39.680 --> 00:22:45.520
 with this iron rod dropping down with different weights to work out how much of a force it could

00:22:45.520 --> 00:22:53.280
 take. And they worked out that actually the one which had the sheep's fur on it could take a lot

00:22:53.280 --> 00:22:58.880
 more force than the one without. Right. I mean, that's an amazing experiment. But also, what a

00:22:58.880 --> 00:23:06.080
 bunch of weird perverts these sites are pummeling a skull wrapped in hair with a rod. Also, you don't

00:23:06.080 --> 00:23:12.000
 see many boxers with beards, right? Like, you figure this new research would change literally the face

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:15.600
 of sport. I wonder if it's in their rules. Like, you know, they're very sort of like what kind of

00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:18.800
 things you can have if you're a cyclist, if you're a boxer, maybe it's like you can't wear a beard.

00:23:18.800 --> 00:23:23.040
 It's like, oh yeah, or maybe it's like a real woossy thing. There's not all the good in with his beard

00:23:23.040 --> 00:23:28.320
 softening the punches. Like giant six foot beard. That's a cushion all the flow. Well, that was the

00:23:28.320 --> 00:23:33.440
 thing with beards, wasn't it? It was like that they were supposed to be like a side of manliness.

00:23:33.440 --> 00:23:41.200
 And apparently that was because they were almost seen as a waste product, a beard. It was like the

00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:47.920
 exhaust pipe of sperm production. So if a man was making lots of sperm, then this was almost like a

00:23:47.920 --> 00:23:53.120
 waste products of the sperm making would be the beard that came out. And that was the theory behind

00:23:53.120 --> 00:23:59.360
 why, you know, the more masculine men would have beards. Well, I didn't think you would say anything

00:23:59.360 --> 00:24:06.400
 of this podcast more disgusting than your weird sheep experiment. The exhaust pipe of sperm production

00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:12.640
 is pure nightmare. For me, it was the stardnosed clitoris earlier.

00:24:12.640 --> 00:24:18.960
 But back to sort of spies and espionage, I read a really good thing. There's an argument that

00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:22.960
 prisoners shouldn't be allowed to have beards because if you escape and you've got a beard,

00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:26.800
 if you shave it off, it's a pretty good disguise. But if you're a clean shaven, to make yourself

00:24:26.800 --> 00:24:30.960
 look different is much more elaborate. It would take much longer. Wait a minute, can you not just

00:24:30.960 --> 00:24:34.480
 grow a beard then the other way around? You'd have to be hidden for quite a while, I think,

00:24:34.480 --> 00:24:37.600
 if you escaped and you come in with your beard. They catch you 10 minutes later,

00:24:37.600 --> 00:24:41.200
 unless you're making a lot of testosterone. Yeah, you can't just go into a phone box and

00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:48.880
 wait in there for a week and then come out. Famous convicts, Burmy Pete, actually managed to

00:24:48.880 --> 00:24:53.360
 avoid recapture every time he escaped. So one really interesting thing, actually, on that,

00:24:53.360 --> 00:25:00.320
 which Dr Withie said to me, which is that it's quite easy to know about posh people's beards

00:25:00.320 --> 00:25:05.120
 from the olden days because lots of people had paintings and stuff like that. But what did normal

00:25:05.120 --> 00:25:09.920
 people have in their beards? Did they wear beards? Did they have different styles and stuff like that?

00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:14.800
 No one really knew because we don't have those kind of records. But what Dr Withie decided to do

00:25:14.800 --> 00:25:21.200
 was to look at prison photographs, which they did have from the 19th century. And what he found was

00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:26.640
 that they kind of like to have this beard that you don't really see anymore, which is almost

00:25:26.640 --> 00:25:32.320
 like a chin strap. So it comes down the sideburns. It goes down the bottom of the chin, underneath

00:25:32.320 --> 00:25:37.600
 the chin. And there's no mustache or anything like that and nothing on the cheeks. I tried to

00:25:37.600 --> 00:25:43.440
 look at other people who had it. I think Henry Thoreau, maybe, or Stormzy, if you can think of

00:25:43.440 --> 00:25:47.920
 either of those two people. Yes. It's that kind of beard. But you don't really see it around anymore.

00:25:47.920 --> 00:25:52.320
 But that was really, if you look at the prisoner photographs from that time, they all had this

00:25:52.320 --> 00:25:56.880
 kind of beard. So it seems like if you're a lower class person, that's the beard you would have had.

00:25:56.880 --> 00:26:01.680
 But if it's really thin lines, that means presumably it's quite a lot of upkeep to have

00:26:01.680 --> 00:26:04.960
 that. So you would probably have taken quite pride in that. It's not just like you just let it grow

00:26:04.960 --> 00:26:10.080
 and it became bushy. That's deliberate. That's kind of what Dr Withie was saying. It is strange

00:26:10.080 --> 00:26:14.880
 because you actually have to work at that. You can't just let it grow and that's what it does.

00:26:14.880 --> 00:26:19.120
 You actually have to put some effort behind it. So yeah, it must have been a fashion.

00:26:19.120 --> 00:26:24.000
 That to me seems a bit also like protection because you know that fact about cravats

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:29.120
 coming about as a result of wearing a bit of scarf around your neck might disguise where your

00:26:29.120 --> 00:26:34.720
 actual neck is in war and if a knife was coming. Imagine if you had a very bushy beard just in

00:26:34.720 --> 00:26:39.920
 front of your neck if you're in prison. That's almost like where's his neck begin. You'd be

00:26:39.920 --> 00:26:45.280
 slashing with a knife and you might just trim the guy as opposed to cutting his neck.

00:26:45.280 --> 00:26:50.960
 Did he manage to cut his throat? I don't know.

00:26:50.960 --> 00:27:00.880
 Okay, it is time for fact number three and that is my fact. My fact is we know who the most

00:27:00.880 --> 00:27:07.360
 significant male actor currently working in German speaking theatre is because he wears a special

00:27:07.360 --> 00:27:14.320
 best actor ring. The most significant male actor in the German speaking which is let's be honest

00:27:14.320 --> 00:27:21.840
 Germany and Austria. He must like walk into a party with you know like when someone just gets

00:27:21.840 --> 00:27:26.480
 engaged and they kind of have the hand in front of the face the whole time so everyone can see the

00:27:26.480 --> 00:27:32.240
 ring. He must do that his whole life. He must right and it's a real sparkly ring. It's got 28

00:27:32.240 --> 00:27:38.560
 diamonds on it so it's a real fashion piece and the story behind this is that it's called the

00:27:38.560 --> 00:27:45.600
 Ifland ring and this was in dedication to a great German actor from the late 18th century called

00:27:45.600 --> 00:27:52.160
 August Wilhelm Ifland who was a brilliant director dramatist. He was a theatre director. He sort of

00:27:52.160 --> 00:27:58.640
 ran most of the theatres in Germany at one point and the story goes because it is a bit of a murky

00:27:58.640 --> 00:28:05.680
 story that this ring was created and was to be handed on to the next person who the previous owner

00:28:05.680 --> 00:28:12.960
 deemed to be the most worthy actor working in German theatre that day. So you would receive

00:28:12.960 --> 00:28:18.400
 the ring upon the death of the previous owner of the ring and once you got this ring you had

00:28:18.400 --> 00:28:22.640
 three months to make your decision about who would be the next person to inherit it. Now they

00:28:22.640 --> 00:28:27.840
 wouldn't get it until you yourself died but they would then once you died open a vault where inside

00:28:27.840 --> 00:28:32.240
 on a bit of paper you will have written who you think that your successor is and they get given the

00:28:32.240 --> 00:28:37.760
 ring. But what happens if you're one of those actors who has a couple of really good movies at

00:28:37.760 --> 00:28:43.120
 the start like who's the guy who we talked about the other week who became a wrestler who was in

00:28:43.120 --> 00:28:48.240
 Scream and Courtney Cox. David Arquette. Well if you're like David Arquette you're like well

00:28:48.240 --> 00:28:52.720
 what a great actor he is and then he goes downhill very quickly. You're right it's absolutely mad

00:28:52.720 --> 00:28:57.520
 that it's you pick the most significant person working within three months of you getting the

00:28:57.520 --> 00:29:03.040
 award when if you're young you might be living for decades. Yeah what if it was like Macaulay

00:29:03.040 --> 00:29:09.200
 Culkin for instance. Like they the guy got his ring let's pretend Macaulay Culkin is a German

00:29:09.200 --> 00:29:14.560
 but they got the ring and then they thought Home Alone and Home Alone 2 are killer movies he's the

00:29:14.560 --> 00:29:20.160
 best actor he obviously is in the world let's give it to him and then 30 years later you die and it's

00:29:20.160 --> 00:29:25.280
 just this guy who's living with Pete Doctey. But do they have a backup plan because if you get it

00:29:25.280 --> 00:29:29.040
 and it doesn't pass on until you die there you know you can't guarantee that you unless you pick

00:29:29.040 --> 00:29:33.040
 someone like Macaulay Culkin who was young then you can't guarantee that you'll outlive them.

00:29:33.040 --> 00:29:37.840
 Well it's like a list like a sort of um like a line of succession for if your choice isn't

00:29:37.840 --> 00:29:43.200
 available. It sometimes happens you're right so the the previous holder before the the current one

00:29:43.200 --> 00:29:49.520
 was Bruno Gantz who played Hitler in Downfall that was maybe his most famous role in the English

00:29:49.520 --> 00:29:56.320
 speaking world and he intended an act called Gert Wost to get it but Wost died in 2014 when Gantz

00:29:56.320 --> 00:30:02.400
 was still alive so he had to change his mind and and re-nominate and as a result he he nominated

00:30:02.400 --> 00:30:06.240
 the new family. Yeah and that's that's happened a few times by the way Gantz when we say Hitler in

00:30:06.240 --> 00:30:10.640
 Downfall for anyone who hasn't seen that movie you probably have seen a very iconic scene from it

00:30:10.640 --> 00:30:17.040
 because it's become one of the most memed movie scenes possible where the subtitles are changed

00:30:17.040 --> 00:30:22.720
 with Hitler having a meltdown if you can picture that great meme that's from that and that's from

00:30:22.720 --> 00:30:28.000
 the great uh most significant German actor of his time one person ago. You think that's what got

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:32.880
 him the nomination it was the meme you're like this is just such an impact all around the world

00:30:32.880 --> 00:30:38.560
 but it has to be you. But I mean so you know that that has happened before Gantz had that happen

00:30:38.560 --> 00:30:44.880
 there was a guy called Albert Baserman who was given the ring in 1908 and he really didn't want it

00:30:44.880 --> 00:30:51.360
 and he named three successors and all of them died before he actually died himself so he thought it

00:30:51.360 --> 00:30:57.440
 was cursed and he wanted to give it away so he actually didn't nominate his successor it was

00:30:57.440 --> 00:31:02.960
 done by a team an Austrian team who decided who the next actor was but he was he was quite a cool

00:31:02.960 --> 00:31:08.720
 actor Baserman he was nominated for his role in an Alfred Hitchcock movie that was made in 1940

00:31:08.720 --> 00:31:14.800
 called Foreign Correspondent and during the filming he had to have his dialogue spelt out to him

00:31:14.800 --> 00:31:20.960
 phonetically because he spoke virtually no English so he was memorizing his lines from a

00:31:20.960 --> 00:31:25.600
 phonetic translation and he memorized them and delivered them so well he was nominated for best

00:31:25.600 --> 00:31:32.960
 supporting actor. That's very cool. Baserman tried to destroy the ring by throwing it into a fire.

00:31:32.960 --> 00:31:40.080
 It's a volcano. Well this is insane. It was at the funeral of the third person he'd nominated who

00:31:40.080 --> 00:31:47.360
 had subsequently died who was Alexander Moises I don't know how that's pronounced exactly but

00:31:47.360 --> 00:31:52.560
 the story goes that he threw it onto the coffin of Moises at the cremation and it was sinking into

00:31:52.560 --> 00:31:57.200
 the flames when the director of the Viennese theatre reached in and grabbed it and he said this

00:31:57.200 --> 00:32:03.280
 ring belongs with a living actor not a dead one so as a result there was a kind of a vote he gave

00:32:03.280 --> 00:32:06.720
 it to the Austrian you know federal theatre body and they had to they had to pick because he said

00:32:06.720 --> 00:32:10.560
 I'm not picking anyone more. It's so incredibly Lord of the Rings though and I also read that the

00:32:10.560 --> 00:32:17.600
 Ilford ring was one of a set of seven originally which definitely adds to this and then I started

00:32:17.600 --> 00:32:23.120
 looking into the Lord of the Rings I just found this um potential Aryan story I think it's not

00:32:23.120 --> 00:32:27.360
 completely it's well I'll tell you the story because I blew my mind and I hadn't heard it before

00:32:27.360 --> 00:32:32.000
 which is there is a ring um a place called the Vienn Hampshire it's a national trust property

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:36.720
 and it's a matter of chunky gold ring it's so big it can only be worn on a gloved thumb it's

00:32:36.720 --> 00:32:42.400
 ginormous and it's inscribed with Latin that says "Sinicianus live well in God" so they found this

00:32:42.400 --> 00:32:48.160
 in the field in 1785 it's a ring it went in the display but then a few decades later they found

00:32:48.160 --> 00:32:55.040
 a um tablet a sighting gloss to show a little little way away and this one contained a tablet

00:32:55.040 --> 00:33:00.640
 which said that a Roman wanted to um let them know someone had stolen his ring and he wanted it back

00:33:00.640 --> 00:33:06.000
 and the tablet said "Among those who bear the name Sinicianus to none grant health until he brings

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:10.960
 back the ring to the temple of Nodans" and the book that makes this really exciting is they

00:33:10.960 --> 00:33:15.760
 contacted a professor of Anglo-Saxon at Oxford University to help them work out who this god was

00:33:15.760 --> 00:33:22.800
 and that was one J.R.R. Tolkien which I thought was so cool so you can see that ring one of another

00:33:22.800 --> 00:33:26.560
 mysterious rings um at the national trust property although they do say it's not completely sure it

00:33:26.560 --> 00:33:30.960
 was connected to the tablet they were a long way away but the story if that's true sounds like it

00:33:30.960 --> 00:33:35.680
 sounds very good that's such a great lord of the rings connection and they do think of the of the

00:33:35.680 --> 00:33:41.200
 seven two do still exist so we've got the one that sits on the most significant actor's hand

00:33:41.200 --> 00:33:46.240
 and a second one is in a private collection but it's suggested that that's either been lost or

00:33:46.240 --> 00:33:51.760
 destroyed so we could be down to the last ring and someone tried to throw it into a fire and this

00:33:51.760 --> 00:33:55.920
 is definitely lord of the rings you know it's a shame I think Bassamon would have rather it had

00:33:55.920 --> 00:34:02.160
 burnt in that fire because the successor that they picked would have absolutely devastated him

00:34:02.160 --> 00:34:09.200
 because Bassamon was married to um his wife who was called Elsa and she was Jewish and during

00:34:09.200 --> 00:34:15.760
 the height of Nazism he was told that he would need to divorce her um if he wanted to continue

00:34:15.760 --> 00:34:20.400
 performing in Germany he said absolutely not and he and Elsa went away to Switzerland to live

00:34:20.400 --> 00:34:25.600
 instead um he was very against it so it would have killed him for the fact that the ring was

00:34:25.600 --> 00:34:31.600
 passed on to Werner Kraus who was part of what is seen as the worst propaganda movie that Nazi

00:34:31.600 --> 00:34:38.880
 Germany ever made about Jewish people uh that was the successor of the ring really just horrible

00:34:38.880 --> 00:34:43.840
 yeah actually you were just saying about Switzerland um and Andy said that basically

00:34:43.840 --> 00:34:48.480
 the only German speaking places are Germany and Austria well of course you did forget about

00:34:48.480 --> 00:34:55.200
 Switzerland oh no which is where Bruno Gantz is from who played Hitler he's Swiss and in

00:34:55.200 --> 00:35:00.640
 Switzerland they have their own ring they have the Heinz Reinhardt ring and that is for whoever's

00:35:00.640 --> 00:35:08.080
 the best Swiss actor and actually in 1991 Bruno Gantz won that as well so for a short amount of

00:35:08.080 --> 00:35:13.920
 time he had both the best actor in Switzerland ring and the best actor in Germany what

00:35:13.920 --> 00:35:19.520
 incredible oh my god yeah he wasn't you know he was in he was meant to be the lead role of pretty

00:35:19.520 --> 00:35:25.040
 woman he was meant to be Richard Geer what the Julia Roberts yeah sorry yeah i've been a very

00:35:25.040 --> 00:35:33.280
 different movie wasn't it Richard Geer court Hitler um but actually you know this guy that

00:35:33.280 --> 00:35:40.640
 i just mentioned the Nazi Kraus he actually tried to be the first person to give the ring to a lady

00:35:40.640 --> 00:35:46.560
 because he thought this shouldn't be just male dominated and the lady um that he wanted to give

00:35:46.560 --> 00:35:53.280
 it to was Alma Seidler who is a brilliant actor at the time and they said no because she was a woman

00:35:53.280 --> 00:36:00.720
 and so as a result since the 1970s a new ring has been created which is the Alma Seidler ring

00:36:01.280 --> 00:36:06.880
 which is given to the most significant female actor in German speaking theater and we're on

00:36:06.880 --> 00:36:13.200
 our third most significant actor as of this year to hold the ring yeah there's a suggestion that

00:36:13.200 --> 00:36:17.040
 jens hauser who's the current holder of the ifland ring might give it to a woman isn't

00:36:17.040 --> 00:36:23.280
 yeah he better do we don't know yeah he's really suggested he will so i hope he does because otherwise

00:36:23.280 --> 00:36:29.600
 that's just all talk isn't it yeah and actually the ring has been with a woman for the last few years

00:36:29.600 --> 00:36:35.440
 at least because jens hauser um apparently keeps it in his daughter's underwear draw does he for

00:36:35.440 --> 00:36:41.680
 safekeeping yeah it feels like a small victory for feminism it doesn't feel like safekeeping if

00:36:41.680 --> 00:36:46.800
 you've told everyone exactly where you keep it and you've put it in your poor daughter's bedroom

00:36:46.800 --> 00:36:53.200
 a 28 diamond ring can i just say for any for any criminals listening because i know you do

00:36:53.200 --> 00:36:58.160
 listen to this podcast um we know what you look like you've got that little beard going around

00:36:58.160 --> 00:37:03.600
 um for any criminals listening um he has moved it from the daughter's underwear draw now it's

00:37:03.600 --> 00:37:07.600
 not there anymore it's somewhere else well that's what you would say that's exactly what you would

00:37:07.600 --> 00:37:18.880
 say if you hadn't moved it from your daughter's underwear okay it is time for our final fact

00:37:18.880 --> 00:37:26.000
 to the show and that is james okay my fact this week is that countries can now send propaganda

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:33.200
 to individual enemy soldiers on the front line by text message every time they turn on their phones

00:37:33.200 --> 00:37:37.600
 wow i'm bad and by countries i mean russia

00:37:37.600 --> 00:37:44.240
 although i suppose anyone could do it but this is an article in The Economist uh from the last

00:37:44.240 --> 00:37:50.000
 couple of weeks and it is about a thing called pinpoint propaganda uh and it is something that's

00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:55.680
 happening on the front between russia and ukraine and apparently a ukrainian soldier might turn on

00:37:55.680 --> 00:38:01.520
 their phone and they'll get a message saying who is robbing your family while you are paid pennies

00:38:01.520 --> 00:38:07.920
 waiting for your bullet that kind of thing i'm settling it's pretty direct then it's not subtly

00:38:07.920 --> 00:38:16.400
 saying hey have you maybe considered retraining i think in warfare probably direct is generally

00:38:16.400 --> 00:38:22.240
 the way to go well they really do go for it so this has been happening for a few years i think it

00:38:22.240 --> 00:38:27.440
 was 2017 at the first examples were received by ukrainian soldiers and they they said things like

00:38:27.440 --> 00:38:32.720
 they'll find your bodies when the snow melts or nobody needs your kids to become orphans and

00:38:32.720 --> 00:38:38.800
 they also they look like they're coming from your comrades sometimes which is very creepy uh yeah

00:38:38.800 --> 00:38:42.720
 except you could quickly ask them why'd you send me that weird thing about my wife and kids

00:38:42.720 --> 00:38:50.240
 i got one from you so i sent one back and this article basically was all about um how mobile

00:38:50.240 --> 00:38:56.320
 phones are a problem in warfare so for instance if you're a country and that you know you there's a

00:38:56.320 --> 00:39:02.240
 front in between you and another country and you want to know where soldiers are you can scan and

00:39:02.240 --> 00:39:07.040
 you can look for mobile phone signals and people might be told to turn the phone off um but there

00:39:07.040 --> 00:39:13.120
 was a quote by lieutenant colonel roovin habel um who is in charge of nato troops in lithuania and

00:39:13.120 --> 00:39:18.720
 he says that it's um just turning on your phone is like a fire in the dark it's basically it just

00:39:18.720 --> 00:39:25.280
 lights you up exactly where you are and they'll know where to attack that's so interesting is that's

00:39:25.280 --> 00:39:29.760
 like just like the equivalent isn't it a first world war having a glowing cigarette which can be

00:39:29.760 --> 00:39:34.000
 seen from a really long way away at night i guess interestingly though if you got a text message

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:38.960
 you would report that to your superior and say we got to get out of here they know exactly where we

00:39:38.960 --> 00:39:43.040
 are yeah but what if you what if you're defending your own territory you can't then say we got to

00:39:43.040 --> 00:39:48.880
 get out of here yeah that's that's uh why i should not be put in charge of we can't do this commander

00:39:48.880 --> 00:39:54.320
 schreiber we just can't do it no no guys let's just get out of here they know where we are

00:39:54.320 --> 00:40:01.280
 they've heard about england we've got to go all of us now yeah but phones but phones are such a huge

00:40:01.280 --> 00:40:06.800
 security beach because yeah there's geo tagging on stuff the um the army had to deny a case recently

00:40:06.800 --> 00:40:10.480
 that somebody gave away information because someone on tinder was asking them too many questions

00:40:10.480 --> 00:40:14.640
 and they gave away information about planes they completely denied it and also there's things like

00:40:14.640 --> 00:40:18.960
 you know if you send a photo to somebody well that can be geo tagged even if even if you've

00:40:18.960 --> 00:40:23.760
 turned off the geo tagging if there's a timestamp on the photo and you can sort of tell by the light

00:40:23.760 --> 00:40:26.960
 you can sort of work out where you are in the world so you can also work out where trips are

00:40:26.960 --> 00:40:31.680
 moving so there's tons of these risks that sit on phones and obviously the really big one is um

00:40:31.680 --> 00:40:36.560
 location trackers and there was that really problematic story recently where fitness trackers

00:40:36.560 --> 00:40:39.840
 got well they didn't even get hacked they released a heat map showing where the people who use fitness

00:40:39.840 --> 00:40:43.840
 trackers were and a lot of them were in us bases abroad and a lot of them ran around their base

00:40:43.840 --> 00:40:48.160
 for their exercise so basically lit up all these areas in deserts and they're like oh wow wonder

00:40:48.160 --> 00:40:54.560
 what's there literally drawing a ring around the the base that's amazing wow well what if you were

00:40:54.560 --> 00:41:00.880
 smart what you would do is like you know in world war two they would um make fake cities wouldn't they

00:41:00.880 --> 00:41:05.760
 so they would set fires and put lights just outside the city so the bombers would come over and bomb

00:41:05.760 --> 00:41:11.600
 the wrong place what you would do is you get your soldiers to run a kilometer away in a shape a bit

00:41:11.600 --> 00:41:17.760
 like a military base and then trick them yes and then all call home with like sort of some elaborate

00:41:17.760 --> 00:41:21.600
 lighting setups it's a different time of day and like completely throw everyone off where you actually

00:41:21.600 --> 00:41:29.120
 are and what you're doing yeah um james you you got this fact from the economist didn't you and um I

00:41:29.120 --> 00:41:33.520
 was reading an article about propaganda in the economist might might very well have been the

00:41:33.520 --> 00:41:38.640
 same article this was an article about all the different terms that have emerged in modern day

00:41:38.640 --> 00:41:46.480
 related to propaganda so in russia for example there's a term which is propagandan which is

00:41:46.480 --> 00:41:52.800
 basically a propaganda condom it's an insult to journalists in russia who are elastic with the

00:41:52.800 --> 00:41:59.440
 truth and it's a portmanteau of of propaganda and the russian word for condom which is sort of

00:41:59.440 --> 00:42:04.480
 derived from the english word for condom but it's gandon so propaganda and gandon together

00:42:04.480 --> 00:42:09.920
 propagandon so you would say of the journalists there who are just peddling basically state

00:42:09.920 --> 00:42:16.480
 propaganda that they are a propagandon the propaganda condom wait are they the they the condom

00:42:16.480 --> 00:42:22.640
 or are they the they're the condom so what what is the penis if they are the condom no no no it's

00:42:22.640 --> 00:42:28.320
 not really it's well i suppose the elastic with the truth is kind of a thing but it's like condom

00:42:28.320 --> 00:42:35.040
 is just like a silly insult that but they are the barrier between i guess the truth so the penis is

00:42:35.040 --> 00:42:39.280
 the penis or possibly the sperm cells are the truth and they're preventing the truth from getting

00:42:39.280 --> 00:42:44.080
 through to the people if you imagine like a sperm exhaust and then there's a barrier

00:42:44.080 --> 00:42:53.760
 who's the beard okay propagandon that's great yeah if you want to use that this is all come a very

00:42:53.760 --> 00:42:58.800
 very long way from early propaganda techniques i didn't know this thing which is that during the

00:42:58.800 --> 00:43:04.000
 first world war germany and britain both had their own propaganda newspapers which were in

00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:10.640
 french so if you see what i mean they were for people who spoke french and occupied belgium and

00:43:10.640 --> 00:43:15.200
 occupied france and and french-speaking prisoners of war so the german one was called the desert

00:43:15.200 --> 00:43:21.840
 then but the british one le courier de laire was a floating newspaper it was distributed

00:43:21.840 --> 00:43:28.240
 as a leaflet from hydrogen filled balloons and it was just released to drift across the battlefields

00:43:28.240 --> 00:43:33.600
 and slowly release bundles of papers as it went so there was a really clever fuse which burnt down

00:43:33.600 --> 00:43:38.960
 and every five minutes it burnt down another notch and it released another bundle yeah i think i think

00:43:38.960 --> 00:43:42.720
 they invented that because it used to be people dropping them out of planes and then two people

00:43:42.720 --> 00:43:46.800
 two people got caught with a lot of propaganda leaflets and then sentenced to hard labor and

00:43:46.800 --> 00:43:51.120
 they're like okay well this is risky so then they developed the balloons to just you'll do it without

00:43:51.120 --> 00:43:55.760
 people and they can completely deny it and be like oh it just floated into your land sorry there's

00:43:55.760 --> 00:44:00.800
 no one obviously operating it it's a bit more difficult to know exactly where your papers are

00:44:00.800 --> 00:44:05.840
 going to end up though right than if people are actually like if i'm a paper boy like i used to be

00:44:05.840 --> 00:44:11.520
 i couldn't use this as my technique for delivering newspapers in bolton could i know exactly and in

00:44:11.520 --> 00:44:17.920
 fact james you're so right because they had to have a weatherman in the early days to consult

00:44:17.920 --> 00:44:22.160
 and if the if the wind was blowing towards france you tied the newspaper and if it was

00:44:22.160 --> 00:44:26.560
 blowing towards germany you attached just out and out propaganda sheets for enemy soldiers so

00:44:26.560 --> 00:44:29.920
 they had to they had two different bundles and they had to pick which but what if you said the

00:44:29.920 --> 00:44:35.040
 wrong one's the wrong way and you like radicalized the wrong group you'd be like yeah problem we've

00:44:35.040 --> 00:44:41.040
 accidentally turned all the french into german soldiers the nightmare propaganda much older

00:44:41.040 --> 00:44:47.200
 even the 20th century during the civil war in england there was quite a lot of it against the

00:44:47.200 --> 00:44:53.120
 cromwells and actually a bit afterwards they were still really bad mouthing the cromwells after

00:44:53.120 --> 00:44:59.600
 the monarchy came back in and there was a book called the court and kitchen of elizabeth commonly

00:44:59.600 --> 00:45:07.440
 called jone cromwell the wife of the late usurper and this was a propaganda cookbook and it kind of

00:45:07.440 --> 00:45:14.560
 looked on the outside that it was jone cromwell's cooking recipes but actually in between all of

00:45:14.560 --> 00:45:19.760
 the recipes there was just a load of like sexual slander about the cromwells and what they used

00:45:19.760 --> 00:45:27.120
 to get up to and all that kind of stuff and stewart oren who is the cromwell museum's curator i read

00:45:27.120 --> 00:45:32.320
 this on atlas obscura he said that it would be a bit like today if you were to buy a cookery book

00:45:32.320 --> 00:45:38.000
 that was supposedly written by michelle obama but the first third of it was an essay by donald trump

00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:45.360
 saying how awful barack obama was oh don't give him ideas because trump will do that now but what's

00:45:45.360 --> 00:45:49.120
 so great though is that especially americans are very bad for this they're writing recipes where

00:45:49.120 --> 00:45:52.960
 there's like a really long backstory before they tell you the recipe so a lot people skip over those

00:45:52.960 --> 00:45:55.840
 sections it's probably the best place to hide something because everyone's like where's the

00:45:55.840 --> 00:46:00.720
 ingredients for brownies i don't want to know yeah you're right you need to you need to put the

00:46:00.720 --> 00:46:05.680
 propaganda in a place that someone's going to read so it's like first set your oven to

00:46:05.680 --> 00:46:13.600
 olive and cromwell was a shanger 270 degrees pick your moments yeah i i read a little bit about

00:46:13.600 --> 00:46:18.000
 that james and the other thing that i really like was that all the recipes in it were even they were

00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:23.040
 picked to target the cromwells they were quite basic recipes if i can put it that way designed to

00:46:23.040 --> 00:46:29.840
 say that all the cromwells would had been terribly common you know eel pies come on guys um sorry

00:46:29.840 --> 00:46:35.600
 that's not rhyming slang for eel pies but you know they were just kind of scuzzy recipes and not

00:46:35.600 --> 00:46:39.520
 for classic people i think that jela lawson does a recipe a day on twitter and i'm pretty sure the

00:46:39.520 --> 00:46:43.760
 day trump left her recipe of the day was bitter orange tart which is very well played i feel like

00:46:43.760 --> 00:46:52.080
 it would fit into this it's everywhere nice um joseph starlin of russian fame one point of starlin

00:46:52.080 --> 00:46:57.040
 fame i would say you've absolutely right he had a plane which was used pretty much solely for

00:46:57.040 --> 00:47:04.080
 propaganda purposes it was called the maxim gorky named after the famous writer and um it was an

00:47:04.080 --> 00:47:09.040
 incredible machine it was one of the largest planes in the world in fact in the 1930s it was

00:47:09.040 --> 00:47:15.120
 the largest plane in the world there were only two built for that specific model and get this it had

00:47:15.120 --> 00:47:20.400
 a cinema on board a library it was exclusively used for propaganda this plane well no no it seems

00:47:20.400 --> 00:47:25.360
 like it was often used for watching movies as well and reading books we don't know what movies

00:47:25.360 --> 00:47:29.920
 were played and we don't know what books you could borrow from the library but no come on andy right so

00:47:29.920 --> 00:47:35.440
 starlin doesn't need the propaganda you're not going to talk starlin into going for communism

00:47:35.440 --> 00:47:40.160
 by playing him a video you need to get the propaganda to the people outside the plane

00:47:40.160 --> 00:47:46.160
 okay i'd say 60 to 70 percent of its function was for propaganda it had some leisure center

00:47:46.160 --> 00:47:51.680
 facilities attached it also had its own leaflet printing and dropping capacity so it could print

00:47:51.680 --> 00:47:57.360
 them in the air pretty cool and it also had a this is what i read it had a giant radio attached to it

00:47:57.360 --> 00:48:01.600
 so it could just blare out propaganda as it flew overhead how long was this plane flying

00:48:01.600 --> 00:48:08.080
 it did fly pretty low because it did these cool flying exercises and that actually tragically led

00:48:08.080 --> 00:48:12.560
 to it crashing because it was flying with several other planes tiny ones which were designed to

00:48:12.560 --> 00:48:17.680
 point out how big the maxim gulfy was and then you know they would do cool maneuvers around it

00:48:17.680 --> 00:48:22.240
 and unfortunately one of them crashed into it and then it crashed that is terrible but the idea of

00:48:22.240 --> 00:48:27.360
 having really tiny planes next to your plane to make it look bigger is quite amazing it's like

00:48:27.360 --> 00:48:30.880
 those crabs that stand next to the ones with small claws to make their claws look bigger but

00:48:30.880 --> 00:48:37.120
 like you know have you guys heard of the sexual deviance pamphlets get out of them dad i've been

00:48:37.120 --> 00:48:44.240
 riding them for five years who made you the head of hr at qi i don't have to answer these questions

00:48:44.240 --> 00:48:50.000
 these are these reviews during world war two and it was basically one of the

00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:56.240
 ways to promote propaganda and change the mood of soldiers is that you would suggest that the

00:48:56.240 --> 00:49:04.080
 wives and partners and and husbands and so on of people back home were sleeping with other people

00:49:04.080 --> 00:49:10.640
 so yeah so you know one batch was dropped on the french front which had images of british soldiers

00:49:10.640 --> 00:49:14.640
 taking advantage of all the french women while they were there so they'd suddenly be like those

00:49:14.640 --> 00:49:20.640
 british bastards and then other leaflets had the french draft dodgers doing the same thing but to

00:49:20.640 --> 00:49:25.520
 french women while you know the hard working soldiers were out there they weren't the actual

00:49:25.520 --> 00:49:29.920
 that you know it wasn't the actual people right it was imagine a leaflet with your wife

00:49:29.920 --> 00:49:34.320
 darling that could be anyone's exhaust

00:49:41.440 --> 00:49:46.000
