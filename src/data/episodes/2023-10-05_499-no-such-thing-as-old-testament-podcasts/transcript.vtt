00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.640
 Hi everyone and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish where we were joined

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:11.920
 by none other than Lou Sanders, one of the funniest people I know.

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:14.400
 You'll know Lou from all sorts of TV stuff.

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:20.080
 She was on Taskmaster, she's been on QI many times, she's just a really, really, really

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:21.080
 funny person.

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:25.160
 We had such a good laugh with her making this show in the Soho Theatre last month, but what

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:30.520
 I really want to say and what is very important is that Lou has a brand new book out.

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:33.720
 The book is called What That Lady Doing.

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:39.240
 It's a really, really great book about how she maybe used to be a little bit unhinged

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:43.720
 and now channels all that unhingedness into amazing comedy.

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:47.160
 It's so well written, I really highly recommend it.

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:53.320
 But one thing I should also say while we're talking about books is that Anna and I have

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:58.440
 written our own book, it's called Everything to Play For, the QI book of sport.

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.560
 It's for people who like sports, it's even for people who don't like sports, who just

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:05.840
 want to read a load of interesting stories and fun facts.

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:08.760
 I mean, it's from me and Anna, you know what you're going to get.

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:13.560
 And it comes out next Thursday, but the reason we wanted to mention it now is because if you

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:22.160
 go to Waterstones and you put in the offer code QISport23, then you will get 25% off

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:26.800
 and that is a deal for pre-order only, so you need to do that before Thursday if you

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:29.920
 want to get our book for a quarter off.

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:34.760
 Anyway, more importantly really for this week is you must go and check out Lou Sanders book

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:40.440
 What That Lady Doing, that's available right now in all bookshops and all online places

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:56.480
 where you get your books, hope you enjoy the show on with a podcast.

00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:01.720
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast this

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:12.920
 week coming to you live from the Soho Theater in London.

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:17.640
 My name is Dan Schreiber and I'm sitting here with James Harkin, Andrew Hunter Murray

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:22.520
 and Lou Sanders and once again we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:27.960
 facts from the last seven days and in no particular order, here we go.

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:33.280
 Starting with fact number one and that is my fact, my fact this week is that names of

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:42.680
 registered competitive roller derby players include Skatebush, Venus Thytrap, Camille

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:49.880
 Toe, Alice in Wunderland and Weird Al Spankabitch.

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:59.200
 Very rude but this is the most fun naming convention I think I've ever discovered which

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:03.360
 is the amazing sport of roller derby largely takes place in America.

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:08.600
 They have this huge registry of names where when you join you almost get like a WWF wrestling

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:13.400
 name, you pick it for yourself, you put it forward and you get added to this big register

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:18.800
 and then when you're out there that's who you are, that's who you embody and there's

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:22.560
 something like 40,000 names that have been put over various different lists over the

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:23.560
 years.

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:29.320
 They're so good, the names are so good, it's a huge list and you can waste a lot of time

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:31.360
 as I did.

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:38.480
 So HP Shovecraft, Roldemort, that's a good one and some of them are just like pure on,

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:47.000
 like there are some just violent ones, Affirmative Smaction, Agatha Crushty, Al Strapone, a bit

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.000
 of a stretch.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.760
 I think they're going for that, are they?

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:55.920
 I think it's Al Capone but with the Strapon, there's also Adolf Glitter, Adolf Hitter,

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:02.320
 Adolf Whistler and Adolf Hitter, I'm sure I think flirting with the taste line, but

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:03.320
 they are good.

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:04.320
 And winning.

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:09.560
 It's an amazing spot, it's mostly women who do it, in fact it's almost exclusively women.

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:10.560
 Fine.

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:14.440
 Well you do it, you're not roller derby but you're a roller skater.

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:17.680
 Yeah, I know some roller derby people, yeah.

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:18.680
 And do you have a name?

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:26.320
 Oh what do we call it, Loose Ends, Loose Ends, Loose Ends because a skating term is to send

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:27.320
 it.

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:28.320
 Loose Ends.

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:32.360
 I actually found roller derby names for each of us, it's going through the database.

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:41.020
 So for you, Lou, there is Lou Brickendt and Lou's your daddy, Lou's your daddy's lovely.

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:44.240
 And there's Andy Clockwise, James Bondage andâ€¦

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:47.240
 Do you know what they do in roller derby?

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:48.800
 Did you think it's Bondage?

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:53.400
 No, in his fantasies, a little bit different.

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:55.400
 Dan Halen or Dansyn Queen?

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:56.400
 Dansyn Queen!

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:57.400
 Oh that's good.

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:58.400
 Yeah, so yeah.

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:03.160
 But the spot is basically you roller skate around the rink, right, and you've got one

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:09.000
 person who's kind of in charge and who you're trying to protect while the other team are

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.480
 trying to get them, basically, it's like that kind of thing, isn't it?

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:16.640
 And it started off, the whole spot started off as endurance races.

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:20.680
 So in the 1880s, there was this huge thing in America, I think we might have mentioned

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:26.520
 it before, of women doing six-day races where they would just walk and walk and walk and

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:31.360
 walk again and again and again until basically there was one person left who would just keep

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:32.880
 walking and keep walking.

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:37.200
 And then they started to do it on roller skates and what they found is that some of the people

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:41.920
 who were faster would get around the circuit and start overtaking people and then the people

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:45.760
 who were being overtaken would really hate it and so they start knocking them over.

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:46.760
 Right.

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:49.960
 And they found that people enjoyed that way more than they enjoyed the rest of it.

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:53.800
 They didn't really quite like people just going round in circles loads and loads of times,

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:56.160
 but they loved it when people beat the shit out of each other.

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:57.160
 Yeah.

00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:02.320
 Well, I can see why though, because the very first one that they did, this is what you

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:09.520
 would come and watch, people skating, roller skating around a ring, 57,000 times.

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:12.800
 The idea was that they were going across America, that's the thing, they'd worked out how many

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:15.720
 times around the thing was to get from New York to LA or whatever.

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:17.840
 Let's stop for breaks though, right?

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:18.840
 Yeah, yeah.

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:19.840
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:20.840
 Not much.

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:21.840
 You wouldn't stop for much breaks.

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:25.960
 You stop for just like 20 minutes here or there and you go 24 hours just with the occasional

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:26.960
 just stopping for the off-map.

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:30.840
 I think it's a lot more fun now, they're sort of bashing each other out of the way.

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:31.840
 Have you done that?

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:32.840
 Have you tried that?

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:33.840
 No, but so many people have told me.

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:36.920
 So basically it's quite aggressive sport, like my friends do it and it's like you end

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:41.760
 up with a lot of breakages and stuff and it's often like big units that do it.

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:46.320
 And so many people have told me that would be really good at it.

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:49.800
 It's so many, but you should do that.

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:52.400
 Do you know what your friends have particular names that...

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:57.240
 Yeah, but I can't remember any of them, but I did write, I only write down two, C-unit,

00:06:57.240 --> 00:06:59.080
 but the I is very small so...

00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:00.080
 C-unit.

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:02.280
 Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:08.360
 And Captain Beaver and I thought, sounds like my love life.

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:13.280
 I was chatting to someone called Lin Huynh who was England captain.

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:14.880
 Hang on, is that a joke name or that's...?

00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:16.280
 It's not, it's real, it's her real name.

00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:17.280
 What's say the name again?

00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:18.280
 Lin Huynh.

00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:19.280
 Oh, OK, Lin Huynh.

00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:21.360
 I did think you said Lin Huynh and that's why I...

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:22.360
 I thought Lin Huynh.

00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:23.760
 That might have been her fake name.

00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:27.920
 No, her fake name was Shaolin Scarlett and she was a captain of the England team in the

00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:30.480
 World Cups in 2014 and 2016.

00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:33.840
 And I was asking her about how it works, she said, "Lots of teamwork is really, really

00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:35.360
 important, the teamwork.

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:39.640
 And when they came up with a new tactic, they all get matching tattoos of their tactic

00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:41.040
 of Lin Huynh.

00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:42.040
 That's pretty hard, Clarice.

00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:44.040
 Well, we do that with our facts, don't we?

00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:48.880
 Remember, yeah, we are absolutely coated head-to-toe, they've had to make the font smaller and

00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:52.440
 smaller as the years go by, because they keep thinking we'll stop, but we won't.

00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:54.680
 Have you got any tattoos?

00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:56.600
 Uh, have a guess.

00:07:56.600 --> 00:07:57.600
 No.

00:07:57.600 --> 00:07:58.600
 I'll never tell.

00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:01.840
 I mean, this is a podcast, you can say what you want.

00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:04.840
 Oh, yeah, I got 16 huge ones, yeah.

00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:05.840
 Got all the lingo.

00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:06.840
 No, yeah.

00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:08.840
 16 big ones.

00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:12.840
 That's why you walked into the tattoo place and said, "Give me 16 big ones."

00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:16.840
 I don't mind what they're of, as long as they're big, yeah.

00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:19.840
 Teenage Mutant Inja Turtle, there's another one.

00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:20.840
 Oh, very nice.

00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:23.840
 I thought that was your tattoo.

00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:25.840
 Two-pack Shanker.

00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:26.840
 That's clever.

00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:27.840
 That's good, yeah.

00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:28.840
 Twat Rocket.

00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:29.840
 Don't quite care.

00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:31.840
 I don't think that one's so clever.

00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:34.840
 Sounds a bit of life.

00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:35.840
 The events as well.

00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:41.840
 Night of the Rolling Dead, Noctober Fest, Spank's Giving, Season's Beatings.

00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:42.840
 Okay.

00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:43.840
 They're great.

00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:48.840
 But there were these big mass events earlier, like even in the 19th century, before they

00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:51.840
 started doing proper skating, before these sort of like formal events.

00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:57.840
 So in 1884, there was a guy called Victor Clough, who skated 100 miles in 10 hours, like

00:08:57.840 --> 00:09:00.840
 in around a course, which was very impressive.

00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:05.840
 And then in 1885, there was a six-day event where they had 36 skaters, again, roller skates

00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:06.840
 competing.

00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:09.840
 And then soon after that, the winner of the race, who was a guy called William Donovan,

00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:12.840
 and another competitor, died.

00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:13.840
 Oh.

00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:14.840
 Yeah.

00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:18.840
 And they said, "Oh, maybe we shouldn't do this for 10 hours a day all the time."

00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:20.840
 Because people just weren't up to it, and they just kept going.

00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:23.840
 I was reading about the walking version that came before the skating.

00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:26.840
 And this was, like I said, it was women doing this for six days at a time.

00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:28.840
 And it became so popular that there was one stage.

00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:30.840
 I can't remember where it was.

00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:33.840
 But there was a load of kids went missing in an area, and everyone thought, "Oh, shit,

00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:35.840
 all these kids are gone missing."

00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:40.840
 And what they found is, they were in a warehouse, and they started their own events of walking

00:09:40.840 --> 00:09:42.840
 around in circles for days on end.

00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:45.840
 And they just were trying to copy what these women were doing, and were like, "Yeah,

00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:46.840
 let's do it ourselves."

00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:49.840
 And they'd been walking around in circles for three days when they were found.

00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:50.840
 God.

00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:52.840
 I thought that was going to take a darker turn.

00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:56.840
 I thought it was going to be like a roller-skating Pied Piper situation, where the Pied Piper

00:09:56.840 --> 00:09:59.840
 had skated through the town, and all the children had danced.

00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:01.840
 Yeah, we thought it was a Jimmy Sapple.

00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:03.840
 I didn't think that.

00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:05.840
 Did you hear of Rinkomania?

00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:06.840
 No, what's that?

00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:09.840
 This is the Edwardian craze for rinks, skating rinks.

00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:13.840
 Loads of venues around everywhere used to be rinks that are now converted.

00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:15.840
 Just because it was so crazy.

00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:17.840
 Basically, because you could meet the opposite sex.

00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:21.840
 That was the, you're a bit less chaperoned, you're able to skate away from your chaperone.

00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:26.840
 I read one article saying, "Mother Grundy, dare not trust herself on skates."

00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:29.840
 Which meant that some, you know, all the person isn't going to be watching you,

00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:31.840
 and making sure what you're doing with the other...

00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:32.840
 Exactly.

00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:33.840
 ...the opposite sex, yeah.

00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:36.840
 My wife started, I can't believe, I just thought of this just now.

00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:39.840
 My wife decided to start roller-skating.

00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:42.840
 And her skate instructor's very upset.

00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:45.840
 What's her street name?

00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:47.840
 Ooh, I'm not sure.

00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:50.840
 I don't want to say anything that will mean I can't go home tonight,

00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:52.840
 because she's here.

00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:54.840
 So, but here's the thing, right?

00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:55.840
 So she bought a pair of roller skates.

00:10:55.840 --> 00:10:57.840
 She hasn't done it since she was a teenager.

00:10:57.840 --> 00:11:00.840
 And we're leaving the house, and she starts putting them on.

00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:01.840
 And I said, "What are you doing?"

00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:03.840
 And she was like, "I'm just going to go and do it now."

00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:05.840
 And I was like, "You've got to test it out in a park.

00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:09.840
 We're on a main road here, and you're going on your own with our child in a buggy."

00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:13.840
 "Wilf was like only a few months, like, you know, nine months old or something like that."

00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:15.840
 So I said, "Listen, I'd better come with you."

00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:16.840
 And she was insistent that she does it.

00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:19.840
 So she put the roller skates on.

00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:21.840
 She took the buggy outside.

00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:23.840
 And you live at the top of a very steep hill, don't you?

00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:25.840
 We do have a bit of an incline on the street.

00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:28.840
 And you go everywhere by unicycle as well, don't you?

00:11:28.840 --> 00:11:33.840
 So I closed the door, and all I hear is, "Ahhh!"

00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:37.840
 And I turn around, and Fenella and the buggy have just gone off.

00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:40.840
 And she can't stop, because she doesn't know how to use the brake on the back.

00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:44.840
 And I have to chase them down the road as they're heading to oncoming traffic,

00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:45.840
 coming on the road.

00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:48.840
 Oh, yeah, there's two guys with a glass going across the road.

00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:49.840
 Wow.

00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:51.840
 I love that spirit, though.

00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:53.840
 That is amazing.

00:11:53.840 --> 00:11:55.840
 Oh, can I ask you, have you seen Roller Limbo?

00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:56.840
 No.

00:11:56.840 --> 00:11:58.840
 This is amazing.

00:11:58.840 --> 00:12:01.840
 Okay, so it is literally, as it sounds, it's limbo on roller skates.

00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:03.840
 Oh, yes, yes.

00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:05.840
 You think you know what it is, and you're wrong.

00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:07.840
 No, no, no.

00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:12.840
 So what you're imagining, maybe, is someone skating towards and then bending backwards.

00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:13.840
 That's what I was imagining, yeah.

00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:14.840
 It's not how you do it.

00:12:14.840 --> 00:12:18.840
 You basically, it's so hard to describe, because I'm behind a desk,

00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:22.840
 but basically, your legs go out to the sides, you go down into the splits.

00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:25.840
 I'll be honest, Andy, I don't think the fact there's a desk here

00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:28.840
 is what makes that difficult for you to imagine.

00:12:28.840 --> 00:12:31.840
 I so wish I could show you all.

00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:34.840
 Well, we have bought some skates for you.

00:12:34.840 --> 00:12:36.840
 So you're doing the sideways splits.

00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:38.840
 You do a sideways splits, but you're moving forwards,

00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:41.840
 and you're holding onto your calves.

00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:45.840
 I know, and you're going under these bars, which are about, I don't know,

00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:48.840
 20 centimetres high, and you're so low as you head for it.

00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:50.840
 You've got to look it up. It is so good.

00:12:50.840 --> 00:12:51.840
 Wow.

00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:52.840
 It's the most amazing thing.

00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:55.840
 Those people need to grow up a little bit.

00:12:55.840 --> 00:12:58.840
 Well, the competitors are mostly children, so...

00:12:58.840 --> 00:13:01.840
 No, good on them.

00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:04.840
 Have you heard of Jean-Yves Blondeau?

00:13:04.840 --> 00:13:05.840
 No.

00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:09.840
 So Jean-Yves Blondeau has invented a new suit made of plastic

00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:12.840
 that has 30 roller skates attached to it

00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:14.840
 in all different parts of his body.

00:13:14.840 --> 00:13:18.840
 So wherever he... If he falls over on his back, he can roller skate.

00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:21.840
 If he falls on his front, he can roller skate.

00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:22.840
 Brilliant.

00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:24.840
 If he falls on his head, he can roller skate.

00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:28.840
 He can walk along the wall and roller skate along the wall as he's going.

00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:29.840
 I can't make it.

00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:31.840
 He can. There's videos on YouTube.

00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:32.840
 Wow.

00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:33.840
 It does it.

00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:36.840
 Is he using it as powers for good or for evil?

00:13:36.840 --> 00:13:39.840
 I would say neither good nor evil.

00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:41.840
 He's just using them for more hits on YouTube.

00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:42.840
 Can he do it on his head?

00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:43.840
 That's incredible.

00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:46.840
 Yeah, the head one, I probably may be exaggerating a little bit.

00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:48.840
 But he could do it in theory, yeah.

00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:51.840
 And he basically goes down all these really big hills around the world

00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:53.840
 as quickly as he can on his suit.

00:13:53.840 --> 00:13:57.840
 How does he stop? Does he have a break on, like, his elbows or something?

00:13:57.840 --> 00:13:59.840
 You know what? I'm not sure.

00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:01.840
 He must have some breaks, yeah.

00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:03.840
 He's still going somewhere right now.

00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:05.840
 Actually, you're going against the butt when they help.

00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:06.840
 You don't need to stop.

00:14:06.840 --> 00:14:08.840
 Like, the reason you stop yourself is in case you fall over.

00:14:08.840 --> 00:14:10.840
 He's already fallen over.

00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:14.840
 You don't need to stop. There's a big wall there.

00:14:14.840 --> 00:14:18.840
 You can just go up the wall and then on the side and then on his head and stuff.

00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:19.840
 It cannot be stopped.

00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:21.840
 He should be stopped.

00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:26.840
 He also has one of his suits, which, these ones you can buy, these 30 ones.

00:14:26.840 --> 00:14:28.840
 I don't know how much they are, but they are available.

00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:31.840
 But he does have one suit, which isn't for sale,

00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:34.840
 but he also features samurai blades and spike horns.

00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:35.840
 Oh, my God.

00:14:35.840 --> 00:14:36.840
 What is that useful for?

00:14:36.840 --> 00:14:38.840
 Probably evil, I reckon.

00:14:38.840 --> 00:14:42.840
 I give him six years of life expectancy.

00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:43.840
 Yeah, exactly.

00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:45.840
 I need to move this on very soon.

00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:47.840
 I've got a couple of other names that I found.

00:14:47.840 --> 00:14:48.840
 So here's the thing.

00:14:48.840 --> 00:14:53.840
 There's a lot of extremely rude names on this registry.

00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:56.840
 And it's done in a kind of empowering way.

00:14:56.840 --> 00:14:59.840
 I think it's sort of, you know, it's exciting to have these real badass names.

00:14:59.840 --> 00:15:02.840
 But, God damn it, they really go for it.

00:15:02.840 --> 00:15:04.840
 So some of them I discovered.

00:15:04.840 --> 00:15:06.840
 Bitch Hiker is one.

00:15:06.840 --> 00:15:07.840
 Okay.

00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:08.840
 Vagina Might.

00:15:08.840 --> 00:15:09.840
 Oh, wow.

00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:11.840
 Is that like Marmite?

00:15:11.840 --> 00:15:12.840
 Yeah.

00:15:12.840 --> 00:15:14.840
 Yeah, you love it or you hate it.

00:15:14.840 --> 00:15:18.840
 It's some kind of yeast extract, I'm not sure.

00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:25.840
 Oh, my God.

00:15:25.840 --> 00:15:28.840
 Well, this isn't what I expected from this podcast.

00:15:28.840 --> 00:15:29.840
 Yeah.

00:15:29.840 --> 00:15:38.840
 It is time for fact number two, and that is Lou.

00:15:38.840 --> 00:15:43.840
 Okay, my fact this week is that the TikTok singer who went viral with The Seashunty

00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:46.840
 is unable to perform his song on the boats

00:15:46.840 --> 00:15:49.840
 because he suffers from terrible seasickness.

00:15:49.840 --> 00:15:52.840
 Yeah, it's typhonic.

00:15:52.840 --> 00:15:54.840
 That's what that is.

00:15:54.840 --> 00:15:55.840
 It's sweet as well.

00:15:55.840 --> 00:15:56.840
 It's lame.

00:15:57.840 --> 00:15:59.840
 It is sweet, it is sweet actually.

00:15:59.840 --> 00:16:01.840
 It was an amazing thing, wasn't it?

00:16:01.840 --> 00:16:06.840
 He basically, it was 2021, he suddenly releases this seashanty called Wellerman

00:16:06.840 --> 00:16:11.840
 and it went to number one, which is, yeah, it went to number one in the UK charts.

00:16:11.840 --> 00:16:15.840
 It's a song about a whale trawler and they're looking for a whale.

00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:17.840
 And this was 2021.

00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:20.840
 So you would think by now, maybe it's died down a bit,

00:16:20.840 --> 00:16:22.840
 but I went on to his Spotify listens.

00:16:22.840 --> 00:16:27.840
 Still, as of today, gets five million listens a month on his Spotify account.

00:16:27.840 --> 00:16:29.840
 That's the same as Tom Jones.

00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:30.840
 Wow.

00:16:30.840 --> 00:16:31.840
 Yeah.

00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:33.840
 So it's not unusual then.

00:16:33.840 --> 00:16:39.840
 Don't shake your head at your own, that is really good.

00:16:39.840 --> 00:16:42.840
 It's not even a seashanty, is it?

00:16:42.840 --> 00:16:43.840
 No, not really, no.

00:16:43.840 --> 00:16:45.840
 No, it isn't, none of these are.

00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:46.840
 Is it River Shanty?

00:16:46.840 --> 00:16:47.840
 What is it?

00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:49.840
 It's just a song.

00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:54.840
 A seashanty has to be something that you sing when you're working.

00:16:54.840 --> 00:16:56.840
 So like Drunk and Sailor is like,

00:16:56.840 --> 00:16:58.840
 "What would you do with a drunk and sailor?

00:16:58.840 --> 00:17:00.840
 You're pulling the rope and you're bringing them to sail."

00:17:00.840 --> 00:17:03.840
 But if he's getting a record deal, he's working sort of on that.

00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:05.840
 That's a really good point.

00:17:05.840 --> 00:17:06.840
 Yeah.

00:17:06.840 --> 00:17:07.840
 He got me there.

00:17:07.840 --> 00:17:08.840
 Checkmate, Harkin.

00:17:08.840 --> 00:17:13.840
 But that is the cool thing about seashanties, like the old seashanties is that

00:17:13.840 --> 00:17:18.840
 because on a vessel you only had a very skeleton crew that had to do multiple things,

00:17:18.840 --> 00:17:22.840
 the song is the beat of allowing you to know how we all work as a group.

00:17:22.840 --> 00:17:25.840
 So the rhythm of it, the lyrics of it would mean

00:17:25.840 --> 00:17:29.840
 you have to pull at that moment and pull at this or whatever places and whatever.

00:17:29.840 --> 00:17:31.840
 So people often see it done on like Navy ships.

00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:33.840
 It never really would have happened on Navy ships

00:17:33.840 --> 00:17:35.840
 because they had so much crew, you didn't need this multitasking.

00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:39.840
 They were banned, the UK Navy, they were banned seashanties

00:17:39.840 --> 00:17:43.840
 because you wouldn't be able to hear commands if you're singing too much.

00:17:43.840 --> 00:17:45.840
 But you're having a laugh.

00:17:46.840 --> 00:17:50.840
 So it's like merchant ships, when wailing ships, things like that.

00:17:50.840 --> 00:17:53.840
 And there were specific songs for different things you were doing on board.

00:17:53.840 --> 00:18:01.840
 So there was hauling shanties, running shanties, pump shanties, swabbing shanties, capstan shanties.

00:18:01.840 --> 00:18:04.840
 Capstan is that thing you turn around in the middle of the ship that pulls the anchor up.

00:18:04.840 --> 00:18:05.840
 Oh yeah.

00:18:05.840 --> 00:18:06.840
 And all these had their own songs, really.

00:18:06.840 --> 00:18:07.840
 That's pretty cool.

00:18:07.840 --> 00:18:09.840
 But it's been like that song that he sang.

00:18:09.840 --> 00:18:12.840
 It's not like it's an obscure song that's not been around for ages.

00:18:12.840 --> 00:18:17.840
 It's one of the better-known sea songs, and you can read a list of places it's appeared.

00:18:17.840 --> 00:18:22.840
 So it was in 2013, it was on the album Now That's What I Call Sea Shanties, Volume 1.

00:18:22.840 --> 00:18:24.840
 No, no.

00:18:24.840 --> 00:18:25.840
 Yeah.

00:18:25.840 --> 00:18:26.840
 I found that.

00:18:26.840 --> 00:18:28.840
 Did you find the Volume 2?

00:18:28.840 --> 00:18:29.840
 Yeah, I did.

00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:30.840
 No.

00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:31.840
 Yeah, it's on Spotify.

00:18:31.840 --> 00:18:33.840
 Not as many listeners as Tom Jones.

00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:34.840
 But it's doing okay.

00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:38.840
 To be fair, it's a great title, and it's not multiple different sea shanty acts.

00:18:38.840 --> 00:18:44.840
 It's just the one band from Wellington in New Zealand called Wellington Sea Shanties Society.

00:18:44.840 --> 00:18:46.840
 But there is a whole genre.

00:18:46.840 --> 00:18:49.840
 And how did they get that name?

00:18:49.840 --> 00:18:56.840
 There is a whole niche genre of pirate metal, and they sing Wellerman as well, this song.

00:18:56.840 --> 00:18:59.840
 It's a Scottish band called Ayle Storm and Stormseeker.

00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:02.840
 They've been known to sing this song, so it's been around.

00:19:02.840 --> 00:19:05.840
 So how come he gets all the money for it then, just because he made it popular?

00:19:05.840 --> 00:19:10.840
 Yeah, it's a traditional song, and so traditional songs, I don't think there's any copyright over...

00:19:10.840 --> 00:19:12.840
 I'm not sure if that's right, I think that's what's right.

00:19:12.840 --> 00:19:13.840
 Yeah, you're right.

00:19:13.840 --> 00:19:16.840
 I think you do get royalties, but you have to bury them on a remote island.

00:19:16.840 --> 00:19:19.840
 That's quite a pain in the arse actually.

00:19:19.840 --> 00:19:21.840
 Okay, a little quiz question for you.

00:19:21.840 --> 00:19:25.840
 When did the last actual proper shanty man, not like modern singers,

00:19:25.840 --> 00:19:27.840
 when did the last proper shanty man die?

00:19:27.840 --> 00:19:28.840
 Oh.

00:19:28.840 --> 00:19:32.840
 Oh, well, I would have thought probably 18th century.

00:19:32.840 --> 00:19:33.840
 Okay, any advancements?

00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:35.840
 1992, 1992.

00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:36.840
 1992, okay.

00:19:36.840 --> 00:19:39.840
 Yeah, 1993.

00:19:39.840 --> 00:19:42.840
 We're just having a laugh.

00:19:42.840 --> 00:19:45.840
 Well, Lou, you're correct, because he died in 1992.

00:19:45.840 --> 00:19:48.840
 Thank you.

00:19:48.840 --> 00:19:51.840
 Are you joking, Lou?

00:19:51.840 --> 00:19:52.840
 No, I'm not joking.

00:19:52.840 --> 00:19:59.840
 I was, as you said it, I was like, keep the poker face, keep, like, don't give away shit.

00:19:59.840 --> 00:20:00.840
 She's got it.

00:20:00.840 --> 00:20:02.840
 I didn't look at his notes or anything.

00:20:02.840 --> 00:20:03.840
 Stanley Hougill.

00:20:03.840 --> 00:20:04.840
 I knew that.

00:20:04.840 --> 00:20:06.840
 He was born in 1906.

00:20:06.840 --> 00:20:08.840
 He was at sea in 1922, at the end of '16.

00:20:08.840 --> 00:20:09.840
 He's got to be.

00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:10.840
 Yeah.

00:20:10.840 --> 00:20:13.840
 And then he was the shanty man on the last ever British sailing ship,

00:20:13.840 --> 00:20:16.840
 which was called the Garth Pool, and that was on its last voyage.

00:20:16.840 --> 00:20:18.840
 And that ship was wrecked in 1929.

00:20:18.840 --> 00:20:19.840
 And then he lived his whole life.

00:20:19.840 --> 00:20:20.840
 He was in the Sakawa War.

00:20:20.840 --> 00:20:21.840
 He settled down.

00:20:21.840 --> 00:20:23.840
 You know, he wrote down all his shanties,

00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:25.840
 because it looked like they're all traditional.

00:20:25.840 --> 00:20:26.840
 There wasn't this proper songbook.

00:20:26.840 --> 00:20:27.840
 Wow.

00:20:27.840 --> 00:20:29.840
 And he died in 1992.

00:20:29.840 --> 00:20:30.840
 Wow.

00:20:30.840 --> 00:20:31.840
 Yeah.

00:20:31.840 --> 00:20:34.840
 And you won't like this, but this is not really yours at back.

00:20:34.840 --> 00:20:36.840
 But I do think I'm a bit psychic.

00:20:36.840 --> 00:20:40.840
 Were you talking about sitting right next to the person

00:20:40.840 --> 00:20:42.840
 who absolutely loves hearing that kind of stuff?

00:20:42.840 --> 00:20:44.840
 Why do you think you're psychic?

00:20:44.840 --> 00:20:46.840
 You think you pulled that out of Andy's head just now?

00:20:46.840 --> 00:20:47.840
 Yeah, basically.

00:20:47.840 --> 00:20:49.840
 And I'm very emotionally intelligent.

00:20:49.840 --> 00:20:55.840
 But you don't even believe in UFOs, so I'm not going to continue.

00:20:55.840 --> 00:20:57.840
 I said that to you in private backstage.

00:20:58.840 --> 00:21:02.840
 That's true.

00:21:02.840 --> 00:21:05.840
 He said he doesn't believe in UFOs and he hates women.

00:21:05.840 --> 00:21:15.840
 Only one of those things is true.

00:21:15.840 --> 00:21:17.840
 He's a lovely lad.

00:21:17.840 --> 00:21:19.840
 Oh, dear.

00:21:19.840 --> 00:21:20.840
 Oh, wow.

00:21:20.840 --> 00:21:21.840
 Just joking.

00:21:21.840 --> 00:21:22.840
 Punishment.

00:21:22.840 --> 00:21:23.840
 Anyone?

00:21:23.840 --> 00:21:25.840
 I think that's actually...

00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:27.840
 I kind of feel like I've had enough.

00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:30.840
 This is to do with music and the army.

00:21:30.840 --> 00:21:33.840
 So corporal punishment in the British army

00:21:33.840 --> 00:21:36.840
 was often meted out by drummers and bands people.

00:21:36.840 --> 00:21:37.840
 You were the drum.

00:21:37.840 --> 00:21:38.840
 In a way.

00:21:38.840 --> 00:21:40.840
 I suppose in a way you were.

00:21:40.840 --> 00:21:43.840
 The cat of nine tails is the drumsticks.

00:21:43.840 --> 00:21:44.840
 It was like rhythm.

00:21:44.840 --> 00:21:46.840
 Well, no, it wasn't so much that.

00:21:46.840 --> 00:21:47.840
 It was probably...

00:21:47.840 --> 00:21:49.840
 There was two possible reasons.

00:21:49.840 --> 00:21:51.840
 One, that other musicians would play music

00:21:51.840 --> 00:21:54.840
 and it would drown out the screams of the person being punished.

00:21:54.840 --> 00:21:55.840
 Punished.

00:21:55.840 --> 00:21:58.840
 But probably because just the people who were drummers

00:21:58.840 --> 00:22:01.840
 or in the band, they were not proper sailors.

00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:04.840
 And so they were like the lowest of the low of the...

00:22:04.840 --> 00:22:06.840
 As far as, you know, who's the most senior.

00:22:06.840 --> 00:22:08.840
 And so the idea was if you were a sailor,

00:22:08.840 --> 00:22:11.840
 you wouldn't want to be meeting out punishment to your...

00:22:11.840 --> 00:22:13.840
 to your peers.

00:22:13.840 --> 00:22:15.840
 And so maybe you would get the person at the bottom to do it.

00:22:15.840 --> 00:22:18.840
 And that apparently is where we get the idea of being drummed out.

00:22:18.840 --> 00:22:21.840
 So being drummed out of the army is because it was the drummer

00:22:21.840 --> 00:22:23.840
 who would do the beating.

00:22:23.840 --> 00:22:25.840
 So they're actually beating you?

00:22:25.840 --> 00:22:27.840
 Yeah, with the cat of nine tails, like...

00:22:27.840 --> 00:22:29.840
 Oh, I see. OK, OK, OK.

00:22:29.840 --> 00:22:32.840
 And do you know what a boy's pussy is?

00:22:32.840 --> 00:22:34.840
 So...

00:22:34.840 --> 00:22:37.840
 It's a former champion roller derby...

00:22:37.840 --> 00:22:39.840
 ..winner.

00:22:39.840 --> 00:22:43.840
 No, just on topic, it was a cat of nine tails,

00:22:43.840 --> 00:22:45.840
 but for younger recruits.

00:22:45.840 --> 00:22:48.840
 So if you're a young person who joined the army,

00:22:48.840 --> 00:22:51.840
 you weren't of age, perhaps, they would have a...

00:22:51.840 --> 00:22:54.840
 Like, a cat of nine tails would have nine, like, whips on it,

00:22:54.840 --> 00:22:56.840
 and there would be knots on it,

00:22:56.840 --> 00:22:59.840
 but yours would only have five, and it'd be made of smooth cod.

00:22:59.840 --> 00:23:01.840
 Oh, that's nice, isn't it?

00:23:01.840 --> 00:23:03.840
 Wow. Yeah, boy's pussy.

00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:05.840
 Crikey.

00:23:05.840 --> 00:23:08.840
 Have you ever heard the sea shanty come all you tongueers?

00:23:08.840 --> 00:23:10.840
 No.

00:23:10.840 --> 00:23:12.840
 Sing it. Just good. I can't sing it.

00:23:12.840 --> 00:23:14.840
 Is it the same as come all you faithful?

00:23:14.840 --> 00:23:17.840
 It's about the tongueers with the guys on board ship

00:23:17.840 --> 00:23:20.840
 who collected stray intestines of whales floating around.

00:23:20.840 --> 00:23:22.840
 Wow. Yeah.

00:23:22.840 --> 00:23:25.840
 I think in Wellerman, he says, "We'll get the tonguing done,"

00:23:25.840 --> 00:23:27.840
 or something like that. Yeah, he does, exactly.

00:23:27.840 --> 00:23:29.840
 So that's what that means. That's what that means, yeah.

00:23:29.840 --> 00:23:31.840
 That's very cool. Not a lovely job.

00:23:31.840 --> 00:23:33.840
 I got a fact about whales singing.

00:23:33.840 --> 00:23:36.840
 Actual whales and whale songs, so I love this.

00:23:36.840 --> 00:23:39.840
 Okay, whale song spreads like human songs,

00:23:39.840 --> 00:23:41.840
 so the scientists found there was a...

00:23:41.840 --> 00:23:44.840
 Basically, there was a hit whale song among humpback whales

00:23:44.840 --> 00:23:46.840
 in the West Coast of Australia.

00:23:46.840 --> 00:23:49.840
 It was only found there, but then several months later,

00:23:49.840 --> 00:23:51.840
 they heard that same song on the East Coast,

00:23:51.840 --> 00:23:54.840
 and this happens in the Atlantic too,

00:23:54.840 --> 00:23:57.840
 and basically hit whale songs make their way from West to East.

00:23:57.840 --> 00:23:59.840
 So you will get whales in the East,

00:23:59.840 --> 00:24:01.840
 which are still singing the old songs,

00:24:01.840 --> 00:24:04.840
 but the whales in the West have a new song by now,

00:24:04.840 --> 00:24:06.840
 and it gradually spreads across,

00:24:06.840 --> 00:24:08.840
 and it's always West to East, and we don't know why.

00:24:08.840 --> 00:24:10.840
 Wow. That is incredible.

00:24:10.840 --> 00:24:12.840
 Imagine like the radar was singing,

00:24:12.840 --> 00:24:16.840
 "It's not on you, it's on you!"

00:24:16.840 --> 00:24:19.840
 He's got to get those photo-fine numbers from somewhere.

00:24:19.840 --> 00:24:21.840
 This is a cool thing.

00:24:21.840 --> 00:24:23.840
 There's seasickness we're talking about,

00:24:23.840 --> 00:24:25.840
 but there's other kinds of sickness that you can get.

00:24:25.840 --> 00:24:26.840
 Motion sickness.

00:24:26.840 --> 00:24:28.840
 Seasickness is one of the motion sicknesses, right?

00:24:28.840 --> 00:24:29.840
 Love sickness.

00:24:29.840 --> 00:24:31.840
 We don't know who the person loves sickness.

00:24:31.840 --> 00:24:32.840
 Yeah, yeah, sorry, yeah, go.

00:24:32.840 --> 00:24:33.840
 What? Is that a thing?

00:24:33.840 --> 00:24:35.840
 I thought you were wanting us to join in with more kinds of sickness.

00:24:35.840 --> 00:24:36.840
 Is that a sickness?

00:24:36.840 --> 00:24:37.840
 Yeah, it was.

00:24:37.840 --> 00:24:39.840
 Is love sickness not a thing?

00:24:39.840 --> 00:24:41.840
 This is this lucky guy.

00:24:42.840 --> 00:24:47.840
 It was a proper thing in the 19th century, wasn't it?

00:24:47.840 --> 00:24:48.840
 Love sickness.

00:24:48.840 --> 00:24:52.840
 They thought that it meant if you had like a pallid expression

00:24:52.840 --> 00:24:55.840
 and like just deep sun-kais and stuff,

00:24:55.840 --> 00:24:57.840
 that's because you were love sick.

00:24:57.840 --> 00:24:58.840
 It was supposed to be a thing.

00:24:58.840 --> 00:25:00.840
 Okay, so with all the sicknesses,

00:25:00.840 --> 00:25:02.840
 it's probably impossible to ever say

00:25:02.840 --> 00:25:04.840
 this was the first person who ever had seasickness.

00:25:04.840 --> 00:25:07.840
 This is the first person who had love sickness, right?

00:25:07.840 --> 00:25:10.840
 But we do know the person who had the first sickness of one kind.

00:25:10.840 --> 00:25:12.840
 So I'll give you the name.

00:25:12.840 --> 00:25:14.840
 He's called German Titov.

00:25:14.840 --> 00:25:16.840
 What did Titov have the sickness?

00:25:16.840 --> 00:25:17.840
 Okay, herpes.

00:25:17.840 --> 00:25:19.840
 Herpes sickness.

00:25:19.840 --> 00:25:22.840
 Titov presumably space race.

00:25:22.840 --> 00:25:23.840
 There we go.

00:25:23.840 --> 00:25:24.840
 What? What?

00:25:24.840 --> 00:25:25.840
 Space sickness.

00:25:25.840 --> 00:25:27.840
 First person to ever have space sickness.

00:25:27.840 --> 00:25:28.840
 How do you know that?

00:25:28.840 --> 00:25:30.840
 I feel I'm a bit psychic.

00:25:30.840 --> 00:25:38.840
 It could be all the Russian history I've read,

00:25:38.840 --> 00:25:40.840
 but I think it's a psychic-sacr-ness.

00:25:40.840 --> 00:25:44.840
 So Titov, he was...

00:25:44.840 --> 00:25:47.840
 Libbit.

00:25:47.840 --> 00:25:49.840
 Wow, I can't read minds yet.

00:25:49.840 --> 00:25:51.840
 I know what you're thinking right now.

00:25:51.840 --> 00:25:55.840
 Yeah, but you're saying that because you've read it,

00:25:55.840 --> 00:25:56.840
 you're not psychic,

00:25:56.840 --> 00:25:58.840
 but I've never read a book of my life.

00:25:58.840 --> 00:25:59.840
 I'll just play that.

00:25:59.840 --> 00:26:00.840
 You've written one, yeah.

00:26:00.840 --> 00:26:01.840
 Yeah, I've written one.

00:26:01.840 --> 00:26:03.840
 So 1961, August,

00:26:03.840 --> 00:26:06.840
 German Titov is the, I think, the fourth human,

00:26:06.840 --> 00:26:08.840
 certainly one of the first batches of human

00:26:08.840 --> 00:26:10.840
 to go up and orbit the Earth.

00:26:10.840 --> 00:26:12.840
 And he's the first person who up there gets,

00:26:12.840 --> 00:26:14.840
 well, space sickness and vomits,

00:26:14.840 --> 00:26:16.840
 the first-ever human to vomit in space.

00:26:16.840 --> 00:26:17.840
 Oh, really?

00:26:17.840 --> 00:26:18.840
 So it's a landmark thing,

00:26:18.840 --> 00:26:20.840
 and it affects so many people,

00:26:20.840 --> 00:26:22.840
 so many astronauts who go up there,

00:26:22.840 --> 00:26:23.840
 and it's for the opposite reason

00:26:23.840 --> 00:26:25.840
 that you might get C sickness

00:26:25.840 --> 00:26:27.840
 or any kind of motion sickness on Earth.

00:26:27.840 --> 00:26:29.840
 You have an opposite effect, right?

00:26:29.840 --> 00:26:31.840
 I don't know the proper science,

00:26:31.840 --> 00:26:33.840
 but to put it in context,

00:26:33.840 --> 00:26:34.840
 if you were in a car

00:26:34.840 --> 00:26:35.840
 and you were reading your phone or a book,

00:26:35.840 --> 00:26:37.840
 you might get motion sickness,

00:26:37.840 --> 00:26:39.840
 because what you're staring at

00:26:39.840 --> 00:26:40.840
 is counter to everything else

00:26:40.840 --> 00:26:41.840
 that is in your normal life.

00:26:41.840 --> 00:26:42.840
 Like a movement around you,

00:26:42.840 --> 00:26:43.840
 you're trying to keep that still?

00:26:43.840 --> 00:26:44.840
 Yeah, exactly.

00:26:44.840 --> 00:26:46.840
 In space, to get rid of everything moving around

00:26:46.840 --> 00:26:48.840
 because of the lack of gravity,

00:26:48.840 --> 00:26:49.840
 you should read a book

00:26:49.840 --> 00:26:50.840
 and to get yourself--

00:26:50.840 --> 00:26:52.840
 My book is now available

00:26:52.840 --> 00:26:53.840
 from all the bookshops.

00:26:53.840 --> 00:26:54.840
 It's called What's That Lady

00:26:54.840 --> 00:26:56.840
 Doing Full Starts and Happy Endings.

00:26:56.840 --> 00:26:58.840
 Cheers.

00:26:58.840 --> 00:27:00.840
 Yeah, it's a--

00:27:00.840 --> 00:27:03.840
 And have NASA expressed any interest, Lou?

00:27:03.840 --> 00:27:06.840
 They've not expressed interest.

00:27:06.840 --> 00:27:07.840
 So here's the thing.

00:27:07.840 --> 00:27:09.840
 They were very worried when it happened to him

00:27:09.840 --> 00:27:11.840
 because he came back down to Earth

00:27:11.840 --> 00:27:13.840
 and was space sickness

00:27:13.840 --> 00:27:15.840
 something that's going to carry through on into life?

00:27:15.840 --> 00:27:16.840
 And then suddenly,

00:27:16.840 --> 00:27:19.840
 they noticed huge changes in his personality.

00:27:19.840 --> 00:27:22.840
 He suddenly was sort of like

00:27:22.840 --> 00:27:24.840
 sleeping around with different women.

00:27:24.840 --> 00:27:26.840
 He was being really rowdy in bars.

00:27:26.840 --> 00:27:28.840
 He was like all these different personality traits

00:27:28.840 --> 00:27:30.840
 and they thought, "God, the space sickness has come down."

00:27:30.840 --> 00:27:31.840
 So they studied him.

00:27:31.840 --> 00:27:34.840
 Hang on. Did my dad go up to space?

00:27:34.840 --> 00:27:40.840
 That's the missing chapter in your book, isn't it?

00:27:40.840 --> 00:27:41.840
 But here's what they worked out.

00:27:41.840 --> 00:27:43.840
 It wasn't space sickness.

00:27:43.840 --> 00:27:45.840
 It's just he was a dickhead.

00:27:45.840 --> 00:27:52.840
 All right, cool.

00:27:52.840 --> 00:27:53.840
 We need to move on to our next fact.

00:27:53.840 --> 00:27:55.840
 It is time for fact number three

00:27:55.840 --> 00:27:58.840
 and that is Andy.

00:27:58.840 --> 00:28:00.840
 My fact is that the people of Iceland

00:28:00.840 --> 00:28:03.840
 can think of a good use for 95% of a cod.

00:28:03.840 --> 00:28:08.840
 So this is a fact about recycling.

00:28:08.840 --> 00:28:13.840
 Do we know, can you tell us what part of a cod there is?

00:28:13.840 --> 00:28:14.840
 Yeah, I was thinking that.

00:28:14.840 --> 00:28:16.840
 That's stubborn the last few percent.

00:28:16.840 --> 00:28:19.840
 Basically, the blood in the eyeballs are quite hard to

00:28:19.840 --> 00:28:22.840
 monetise and make, you know,

00:28:22.840 --> 00:28:23.840
 you properly use it.

00:28:23.840 --> 00:28:24.840
 I've always said that.

00:28:24.840 --> 00:28:26.840
 Blood in the eyeballs are hard to monetise.

00:28:26.840 --> 00:28:29.840
 We have said that the aqueous humour in the eye

00:28:29.840 --> 00:28:31.840
 can be drunk in an emergency.

00:28:31.840 --> 00:28:33.840
 Yes, it's just hard to monetise.

00:28:33.840 --> 00:28:34.840
 Yeah, it's hard to...

00:28:34.840 --> 00:28:35.840
 Monetise emergency.

00:28:35.840 --> 00:28:37.840
 Yeah, and there is a use for the blood as well.

00:28:37.840 --> 00:28:41.840
 It can be used in sausages or as fish food,

00:28:41.840 --> 00:28:44.840
 but it's hard to get fish to collect the blood from them.

00:28:44.840 --> 00:28:46.840
 Anyway, basically, this is from a magazine

00:28:46.840 --> 00:28:48.840
 called Hakai Magazine, which we've mentioned before.

00:28:48.840 --> 00:28:49.840
 Anna's favourite.

00:28:49.840 --> 00:28:50.840
 Anna's favourite magazine.

00:28:50.840 --> 00:28:51.840
 Anna's favourite magazine.

00:28:51.840 --> 00:28:53.840
 It's all about the sea and everything, nautical

00:28:53.840 --> 00:28:54.840
 and all about water, basically.

00:28:54.840 --> 00:28:56.840
 And Iceland catch loads of cod,

00:28:56.840 --> 00:28:59.840
 and they didn't use much of it until recently.

00:28:59.840 --> 00:29:03.840
 They used 40% of the cod in the early 2000s.

00:29:03.840 --> 00:29:04.840
 Nightmare.

00:29:04.840 --> 00:29:05.840
 Lots of waste.

00:29:05.840 --> 00:29:06.840
 Yeah.

00:29:06.840 --> 00:29:07.840
 You know, you're using the fillets,

00:29:07.840 --> 00:29:08.840
 so you're eating the meat,

00:29:08.840 --> 00:29:09.840
 but not really using it properly.

00:29:09.840 --> 00:29:12.840
 So there is a project called 100% Fish,

00:29:12.840 --> 00:29:16.840
 which aims to put all of the cod caught to good use,

00:29:16.840 --> 00:29:18.840
 you know, just use the whole thing,

00:29:18.840 --> 00:29:19.840
 which is much more sensible.

00:29:19.840 --> 00:29:22.840
 So the skin, if you've had a burn,

00:29:22.840 --> 00:29:24.840
 the skin can be grafted onto people now.

00:29:24.840 --> 00:29:26.840
 So there are people who are part cod.

00:29:26.840 --> 00:29:27.840
 No.

00:29:27.840 --> 00:29:28.840
 Yeah.

00:29:28.840 --> 00:29:29.840
 Really?

00:29:29.840 --> 00:29:30.840
 And you can see the imprint of the scales as well.

00:29:30.840 --> 00:29:32.840
 But it's a really good thing for skin grafts.

00:29:32.840 --> 00:29:33.840
 Like, it's really, it's really,

00:29:33.840 --> 00:29:35.840
 thousands of people have been treated with cod skin.

00:29:35.840 --> 00:29:37.840
 Would it make you swim faster?

00:29:37.840 --> 00:29:38.840
 No.

00:29:38.840 --> 00:29:39.840
 What?

00:29:39.840 --> 00:29:40.840
 No.

00:29:40.840 --> 00:29:41.840
 Absolutely not.

00:29:41.840 --> 00:29:42.840
 Why not?

00:29:42.840 --> 00:29:43.840
 You're recovering from a major operation.

00:29:43.840 --> 00:29:44.840
 You've been through hell.

00:29:44.840 --> 00:29:46.840
 Suddenly, there's Dr. Harkin at the door saying,

00:29:46.840 --> 00:29:48.840
 "In your speeders, come on."

00:29:48.840 --> 00:29:50.840
 But what I'm thinking is, you could,

00:29:50.840 --> 00:29:52.840
 is there not a way in the Olympics,

00:29:52.840 --> 00:29:53.840
 the next Olympics,

00:29:53.840 --> 00:29:55.840
 we put this cod skin on all of our swimmers.

00:29:55.840 --> 00:29:56.840
 Yeah?

00:29:56.840 --> 00:29:57.840
 No?

00:29:57.840 --> 00:29:58.840
 You're right.

00:29:58.840 --> 00:29:59.840
 Well, maybe it would.

00:29:59.840 --> 00:30:00.840
 Maybe it would work.

00:30:00.840 --> 00:30:01.840
 That's a good point.

00:30:01.840 --> 00:30:02.840
 I don't know.

00:30:02.840 --> 00:30:03.840
 But then you retire like age 27.

00:30:03.840 --> 00:30:05.840
 Did you just cover the con for the rest of your life?

00:30:05.840 --> 00:30:06.840
 Smelling a fish?

00:30:06.840 --> 00:30:07.840
 No one wants to hang out with you.

00:30:07.840 --> 00:30:08.840
 Yeah.

00:30:08.840 --> 00:30:09.840
 Yeah.

00:30:09.840 --> 00:30:10.840
 No, you're right.

00:30:10.840 --> 00:30:11.840
 Tom Scaly.

00:30:11.840 --> 00:30:12.840
 Yeah?

00:30:12.840 --> 00:30:13.840
 Tom Scaly.

00:30:13.840 --> 00:30:14.840
 Do you get it?

00:30:14.840 --> 00:30:15.840
 Oh, yeah.

00:30:15.840 --> 00:30:16.840
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:30:16.840 --> 00:30:17.840
 There's a guy called Tom Daly.

00:30:17.840 --> 00:30:18.840
 Daly.

00:30:18.840 --> 00:30:19.840
 And he's got, yeah.

00:30:19.840 --> 00:30:20.840
 Do you get it?

00:30:20.840 --> 00:30:21.840
 Tom Daly.

00:30:21.840 --> 00:30:22.840
 Yeah, I put the cod on him.

00:30:22.840 --> 00:30:23.840
 Yeah.

00:30:23.840 --> 00:30:24.840
 And it's Tom Scaly.

00:30:24.840 --> 00:30:25.840
 He dives though,

00:30:25.840 --> 00:30:26.840
 which would presumably be a nightmare

00:30:26.840 --> 00:30:27.840
 if he was plunging downwards

00:30:27.840 --> 00:30:29.840
 and then just like hit the bottom

00:30:29.840 --> 00:30:30.840
 at torpedo speed.

00:30:30.840 --> 00:30:31.840
 Yeah.

00:30:31.840 --> 00:30:32.840
 No suits for Tom Scaly.

00:30:32.840 --> 00:30:33.840
 Yeah.

00:30:33.840 --> 00:30:34.840
 Anyway.

00:30:34.840 --> 00:30:35.840
 Some uses of a cod.

00:30:35.840 --> 00:30:36.840
 Oh, yeah.

00:30:36.840 --> 00:30:37.840
 Yeah.

00:30:37.840 --> 00:30:40.840
 So if you are a professional fisher person,

00:30:40.840 --> 00:30:42.840
 and when I say professional,

00:30:42.840 --> 00:30:44.840
 I mean you're doing it in competitions.

00:30:44.840 --> 00:30:46.840
 So you've seen who can catch the biggest fish.

00:30:46.840 --> 00:30:47.840
 Yeah.

00:30:47.840 --> 00:30:49.840
 The way that they tell which fish is the best

00:30:49.840 --> 00:30:50.840
 is they weigh it.

00:30:50.840 --> 00:30:53.840
 Now, some people will put some like metal

00:30:53.840 --> 00:30:56.840
 or something inside the fish to weigh it down.

00:30:56.840 --> 00:30:59.840
 Now, what if you bought some cod on the way

00:30:59.840 --> 00:31:02.840
 and you've shoved it inside your fish,

00:31:02.840 --> 00:31:03.840
 they'll never find it

00:31:03.840 --> 00:31:05.840
 because it's fish inside fish.

00:31:05.840 --> 00:31:06.840
 Amazing.

00:31:06.840 --> 00:31:07.840
 And that's what happens.

00:31:07.840 --> 00:31:09.840
 There's this big scandal in fishing

00:31:09.840 --> 00:31:11.840
 which people have been buying fillets of cod

00:31:11.840 --> 00:31:13.840
 and shoving them inside the fishes

00:31:13.840 --> 00:31:14.840
 to make them heavier.

00:31:14.840 --> 00:31:15.840
 That's disgusting.

00:31:15.840 --> 00:31:17.840
 That's so disgusting.

00:31:17.840 --> 00:31:18.840
 It's true.

00:31:18.840 --> 00:31:21.840
 And there was a notorious case really recently last year

00:31:21.840 --> 00:31:24.840
 which was uncovered by a judge called Jason Fisher.

00:31:24.840 --> 00:31:26.840
 Oh, wow.

00:31:26.840 --> 00:31:29.840
 How desperate do you have to be to win an angling competition

00:31:29.840 --> 00:31:32.840
 that you're busy shoving cod up another fish's arse?

00:31:32.840 --> 00:31:33.840
 What is the...

00:31:33.840 --> 00:31:35.840
 You must have a look at your life then

00:31:35.840 --> 00:31:37.840
 and think, "I've lost my priorities."

00:31:37.840 --> 00:31:40.840
 I'd go down the mouth.

00:31:40.840 --> 00:31:41.840
 Would you?

00:31:41.840 --> 00:31:43.840
 I probably would, yeah,

00:31:43.840 --> 00:31:45.840
 as opposed to the small opening.

00:31:45.840 --> 00:31:48.840
 Which is more plausible.

00:31:48.840 --> 00:31:51.840
 Which is more fun, you know?

00:31:51.840 --> 00:31:54.840
 You've got to get some fun out of it.

00:31:54.840 --> 00:31:56.840
 God, that's really clever, yeah?

00:31:56.840 --> 00:31:58.840
 It's good, isn't it? It's really clever.

00:31:58.840 --> 00:32:00.840
 By the way, how many of us on this stage

00:32:00.840 --> 00:32:01.840
 have been to Iceland?

00:32:01.840 --> 00:32:02.840
 I haven't. I know you haven't.

00:32:02.840 --> 00:32:03.840
 I've been a few times.

00:32:03.840 --> 00:32:04.840
 Yeah, you went.

00:32:04.840 --> 00:32:06.840
 You did a TV thing, though, didn't you?

00:32:06.840 --> 00:32:07.840
 What was it?

00:32:07.840 --> 00:32:08.840
 Dangerous roads.

00:32:08.840 --> 00:32:10.840
 And it is good to go to Iceland

00:32:10.840 --> 00:32:11.840
 when someone else is paying for it

00:32:11.840 --> 00:32:12.840
 because it's so expensive.

00:32:12.840 --> 00:32:13.840
 Is it really?

00:32:13.840 --> 00:32:14.840
 It's so expensive.

00:32:14.840 --> 00:32:15.840
 I was like, "This is really good.

00:32:15.840 --> 00:32:17.840
 I'll have another sandwich."

00:32:17.840 --> 00:32:19.840
 What did you see?

00:32:19.840 --> 00:32:22.840
 Oh, yeah, I suppose it wasn't about the sandwiches.

00:32:22.840 --> 00:32:25.840
 I saw Ed Gamble.

00:32:25.840 --> 00:32:27.840
 Do you know a fact about Iceland?

00:32:27.840 --> 00:32:28.840
 Everyone's...

00:32:28.840 --> 00:32:29.840
 Loads of people are called Daddy.

00:32:29.840 --> 00:32:31.840
 So it was my heaven.

00:32:31.840 --> 00:32:33.840
 Because that's the name of Dave.

00:32:33.840 --> 00:32:34.840
 That's Dave.

00:32:34.840 --> 00:32:35.840
 They're called...

00:32:35.840 --> 00:32:36.840
 If your name's Dave in England,

00:32:36.840 --> 00:32:38.840
 you'd be called Daddy in Iceland.

00:32:38.840 --> 00:32:39.840
 Chaz and Daddy.

00:32:39.840 --> 00:32:40.840
 Yeah.

00:32:40.840 --> 00:32:42.840
 So our fixer was called Daddy.

00:32:42.840 --> 00:32:44.840
 And he keeps saying, "Daddy, Daddy."

00:32:44.840 --> 00:32:45.840
 Good fun.

00:32:45.840 --> 00:32:47.840
 So in Iceland, you're like...

00:32:47.840 --> 00:32:49.840
 Oh, my God, the winner from Taskmaster.

00:32:49.840 --> 00:32:50.840
 From Daddy, Channel Daddy.

00:32:50.840 --> 00:32:51.840
 Yeah, Channel Daddy.

00:32:51.840 --> 00:32:52.840
 Yeah, Channel Daddy.

00:32:52.840 --> 00:32:53.840
 It was on Channel Daddy.

00:32:53.840 --> 00:32:54.840
 Wow.

00:32:54.840 --> 00:32:55.840
 Dave.

00:32:55.840 --> 00:32:56.840
 Oh, I've just understood that.

00:32:56.840 --> 00:32:57.840
 Sorry.

00:32:57.840 --> 00:32:59.840
 I was thinking it was on Channel 4, isn't it?

00:32:59.840 --> 00:33:00.840
 No, got it.

00:33:00.840 --> 00:33:01.840
 Oh, sorry.

00:33:01.840 --> 00:33:02.840
 No, it did get 4 by 0.

00:33:02.840 --> 00:33:04.840
 But series 8 when you were on.

00:33:04.840 --> 00:33:06.840
 Which is there more of in Iceland?

00:33:06.840 --> 00:33:08.840
 Rabbits or Rabbis?

00:33:08.840 --> 00:33:10.840
 Oh, that's good.

00:33:10.840 --> 00:33:11.840
 Rabbis.

00:33:11.840 --> 00:33:12.840
 You're saying Rabbis?

00:33:12.840 --> 00:33:13.840
 I think so.

00:33:13.840 --> 00:33:15.840
 Audience have pitched in with a vote for Rabbis, OK?

00:33:15.840 --> 00:33:16.840
 Well, Rabbits.

00:33:16.840 --> 00:33:17.840
 Rabbits, thank you.

00:33:17.840 --> 00:33:19.840
 Yeah, I would say probably a lot of countries

00:33:19.840 --> 00:33:21.840
 don't have any Rabbits, so I'll say Rabbis.

00:33:21.840 --> 00:33:23.840
 One Rabbi, no Rabbits.

00:33:23.840 --> 00:33:24.840
 You're half right.

00:33:24.840 --> 00:33:26.840
 They've got loads of Rabbits and only one Rabbi.

00:33:26.840 --> 00:33:27.840
 I know.

00:33:27.840 --> 00:33:30.840
 I know a really good fact about Iceland.

00:33:30.840 --> 00:33:32.840
 Here we go.

00:33:32.840 --> 00:33:34.840
 They've got a dating app,

00:33:34.840 --> 00:33:36.840
 because because it's such a small country,

00:33:36.840 --> 00:33:38.840
 everyone's sort of related.

00:33:38.840 --> 00:33:40.840
 So you could sleep with someone in the pub,

00:33:40.840 --> 00:33:42.840
 and it could be your first cousin.

00:33:42.840 --> 00:33:43.840
 Oh, my God.

00:33:43.840 --> 00:33:45.840
 And so they've got a dating app,

00:33:45.840 --> 00:33:46.840
 which this is true.

00:33:46.840 --> 00:33:48.840
 I don't know why everyone's looking at me like this.

00:33:48.840 --> 00:33:51.840
 And they've got a dating app where you can tell

00:33:51.840 --> 00:33:54.840
 how far removed the person you've just got off with is.

00:33:54.840 --> 00:33:55.840
 Wait, wait, wait.

00:33:55.840 --> 00:33:56.840
 Don't you do it before?

00:33:56.840 --> 00:33:57.840
 Yeah, maybe do it before.

00:33:57.840 --> 00:33:58.840
 Maybe do it before.

00:33:58.840 --> 00:33:59.840
 There's no way they're going to turn the lights on

00:33:59.840 --> 00:34:01.840
 and you're like, "Daddy!"

00:34:06.840 --> 00:34:07.840
 So they don't know...

00:34:07.840 --> 00:34:09.840
 Like, you don't know all your cousins or whatever,

00:34:09.840 --> 00:34:11.840
 but because so many people are related,

00:34:11.840 --> 00:34:14.840
 and it's caused problems with babies coming out,

00:34:14.840 --> 00:34:16.840
 odd and stuff,

00:34:16.840 --> 00:34:19.840
 that someone developed this dating app so you can tell.

00:34:19.840 --> 00:34:20.840
 Wow, that's amazing.

00:34:20.840 --> 00:34:22.840
 But imagine if you're in the Throws of Passion,

00:34:22.840 --> 00:34:24.840
 and you're like, "Oh, God, I've just turned the app, maybe."

00:34:24.840 --> 00:34:26.840
 "Oh, no, maybe I won't bother."

00:34:26.840 --> 00:34:32.840
 Iceland is home to the hottest hole on the planet.

00:34:32.840 --> 00:34:34.840
 The hottest hole.

00:34:34.840 --> 00:34:35.840
 Literally the hottest hole.

00:34:35.840 --> 00:34:36.840
 Okay.

00:34:36.840 --> 00:34:39.840
 So Geothermal Hole is the Iceland Deep Drilling Project,

00:34:39.840 --> 00:34:42.840
 and it's 5,000 degrees Celsius at the bottom.

00:34:42.840 --> 00:34:43.840
 It's really hot.

00:34:43.840 --> 00:34:44.840
 I think that's been there.

00:34:44.840 --> 00:34:45.840
 You've been there.

00:34:45.840 --> 00:34:46.840
 I think I have.

00:34:46.840 --> 00:34:47.840
 I think so.

00:34:47.840 --> 00:34:48.840
 And then there's a big factory on top of it

00:34:48.840 --> 00:34:49.840
 where you can go and visit.

00:34:49.840 --> 00:34:50.840
 That's very cool.

00:34:50.840 --> 00:34:51.840
 I think so.

00:34:51.840 --> 00:34:52.840
 Yeah.

00:34:52.840 --> 00:34:53.840
 Basically, the pressure is too high.

00:34:53.840 --> 00:34:54.840
 You put water down there,

00:34:54.840 --> 00:34:56.840
 and it becomes something called Supercritical,

00:34:56.840 --> 00:34:58.840
 which I do not fully understand,

00:34:58.840 --> 00:35:00.840
 but it's basically neither liquid nor gas.

00:35:00.840 --> 00:35:02.840
 I don't know what it is.

00:35:02.840 --> 00:35:03.840
 Solid?

00:35:03.840 --> 00:35:04.840
 Yeah.

00:35:04.840 --> 00:35:07.840
 It's ice.

00:35:07.840 --> 00:35:10.840
 If you heat water up enough, it becomes ice again.

00:35:10.840 --> 00:35:12.840
 Very new science.

00:35:12.840 --> 00:35:13.840
 Yeah.

00:35:13.840 --> 00:35:16.840
 It's so useful because they use it to heat everything.

00:35:16.840 --> 00:35:19.840
 They can have underpavement heating from the geothermal heat.

00:35:19.840 --> 00:35:21.840
 So people don't fall over on the ice,

00:35:21.840 --> 00:35:22.840
 because obviously it gets really icy,

00:35:22.840 --> 00:35:24.840
 but you don't slip over and fall, so it's very hard.

00:35:24.840 --> 00:35:26.840
 But they use it for so much, don't they?

00:35:26.840 --> 00:35:31.840
 Like most of the houses that the hot water comes literally

00:35:31.840 --> 00:35:33.840
 from the core of our earth.

00:35:33.840 --> 00:35:35.840
 It's heated by geothermal heat.

00:35:35.840 --> 00:35:37.840
 Hot water literally from the core of our earth.

00:35:37.840 --> 00:35:39.840
 We can edit out the literally from our weather,

00:35:39.840 --> 00:35:42.840
 but it's like they got round problems.

00:35:42.840 --> 00:35:44.840
 But what about that dating app?

00:35:44.840 --> 00:35:49.840
 Have we ever spoken about the day

00:35:49.840 --> 00:35:51.840
 that all the women went on strike in Iceland?

00:35:51.840 --> 00:35:52.840
 I think so.

00:35:52.840 --> 00:35:53.840
 We have.

00:35:53.840 --> 00:35:54.840
 1975.

00:35:54.840 --> 00:35:56.840
 Basically, there was a thing.

00:35:56.840 --> 00:35:59.840
 The United Nations proclaimed it women's year,

00:35:59.840 --> 00:36:03.840
 and basically the women of Iceland got together,

00:36:03.840 --> 00:36:06.840
 this group of women as a sort of representative

00:36:06.840 --> 00:36:08.840
 and went, we should go on strike

00:36:08.840 --> 00:36:10.840
 and make a point about the fact that we're paid less.

00:36:10.840 --> 00:36:11.840
 We should make a point about

00:36:11.840 --> 00:36:13.840
 we're doing all the domestic stuff at home.

00:36:13.840 --> 00:36:14.840
 We're doing all this stuff.

00:36:14.840 --> 00:36:16.840
 Let's really let them know that this is

00:36:16.840 --> 00:36:18.840
 something that we disagree with.

00:36:18.840 --> 00:36:20.840
 And Iceland back then, in 1975,

00:36:20.840 --> 00:36:23.840
 there's 200,000 people that live in Iceland.

00:36:23.840 --> 00:36:26.840
 25,000 women were at one single event

00:36:26.840 --> 00:36:28.840
 to hear the speeches that were in the lead up to this.

00:36:28.840 --> 00:36:32.840
 And so instead of calling a strike,

00:36:32.840 --> 00:36:34.840
 they thought we might piss off too many people

00:36:34.840 --> 00:36:35.840
 and it won't happen.

00:36:35.840 --> 00:36:37.840
 So they said, could we have a day off?

00:36:37.840 --> 00:36:39.840
 And they went, oh, a day off sounds nice.

00:36:39.840 --> 00:36:40.840
 Yeah, have a day off.

00:36:40.840 --> 00:36:43.840
 So every woman in Iceland had a day off,

00:36:43.840 --> 00:36:45.840
 and the country went into chaos.

00:36:45.840 --> 00:36:47.840
 Supermarkets sold out of sausages

00:36:47.840 --> 00:36:50.840
 because dads didn't know what to cook their kids.

00:36:50.840 --> 00:36:53.840
 Everyone was working jobs that they didn't necessarily

00:36:53.840 --> 00:36:55.840
 knew how to do because they thought they were at a higher level

00:36:55.840 --> 00:36:57.840
 and they were suddenly having to be the teller at a bank

00:36:57.840 --> 00:37:00.840
 rather than the bank manager at a bank kind of thing.

00:37:00.840 --> 00:37:03.840
 The men refer to it still the Long Friday

00:37:03.840 --> 00:37:07.840
 because it was such a nightmare.

00:37:07.840 --> 00:37:10.840
 Hey, I need to move us on to our final fact of the show.

00:37:10.840 --> 00:37:11.840
 Can I tell you one last thing?

00:37:11.840 --> 00:37:12.840
 Yeah, of course.

00:37:12.840 --> 00:37:14.840
 This is something that happened to an American visitor to Iceland

00:37:14.840 --> 00:37:15.840
 in 2016.

00:37:15.840 --> 00:37:17.840
 He was called Noel Santillan.

00:37:17.840 --> 00:37:19.840
 He was on holiday and he arrived,

00:37:19.840 --> 00:37:20.840
 hired his car.

00:37:20.840 --> 00:37:23.840
 He wanted to go to Laugavegur Street.

00:37:23.840 --> 00:37:24.840
 I'm sure I'm pronouncing that wrong.

00:37:24.840 --> 00:37:26.840
 45 minutes from the airport, thought no problem.

00:37:26.840 --> 00:37:28.840
 He misspelled it by one letter

00:37:28.840 --> 00:37:31.840
 and Iceland sent him six hours,

00:37:31.840 --> 00:37:35.840
 265 miles away to a tiny fishing village.

00:37:35.840 --> 00:37:37.840
 So he got there.

00:37:37.840 --> 00:37:38.840
 Bloody hell.

00:37:38.840 --> 00:37:40.840
 But the people were very friendly and they were like,

00:37:40.840 --> 00:37:42.840
 "Oh, what a funny mistake to make."

00:37:42.840 --> 00:37:44.840
 "Oh, well, he stayed there for a few days like making friends."

00:37:44.840 --> 00:37:45.840
 "Oh, it's the funny American."

00:37:45.840 --> 00:37:48.840
 On the way back, he was trying to get to the Blue Lagoon geothermal spa.

00:37:48.840 --> 00:37:50.840
 It happened again.

00:37:50.840 --> 00:37:52.840
 He ended up in the coastal town,

00:37:52.840 --> 00:37:54.840
 which is home to the office of the company which owns the spa.

00:37:54.840 --> 00:37:56.840
 So he just ended up in an office building.

00:37:56.840 --> 00:38:00.840
 Literally, he walked into a staff meeting rather than anything.

00:38:00.840 --> 00:38:03.840
 And they said, "Ah, you must be the American."

00:38:03.840 --> 00:38:14.840
 I need to move us on to our final fact of the show,

00:38:14.840 --> 00:38:16.840
 and that is James.

00:38:16.840 --> 00:38:18.840
 OK, my fact this week is that there is an app

00:38:18.840 --> 00:38:21.840
 that can tell you when your fly is down.

00:38:21.840 --> 00:38:22.840
 Yeah.

00:38:22.840 --> 00:38:24.840
 It's just useful, isn't it?

00:38:24.840 --> 00:38:25.840
 Right.

00:38:25.840 --> 00:38:27.840
 It's the work of a guy called Guy Dupont,

00:38:27.840 --> 00:38:30.840
 who is a YouTuber and a hacker.

00:38:30.840 --> 00:38:32.840
 And he's invented loads of things.

00:38:32.840 --> 00:38:34.840
 He's invented, like, a baby monitor,

00:38:34.840 --> 00:38:39.840
 which vibrates when the baby cries so it's more accessible.

00:38:39.840 --> 00:38:43.840
 He hacks his fridge so it tells him when he accidentally leaves it open.

00:38:43.840 --> 00:38:46.840
 But this is, by far, his most useful invention.

00:38:46.840 --> 00:38:48.840
 It's a pair of smart pants.

00:38:48.840 --> 00:38:53.840
 And whenever your fly has been down for, let's say, 30 seconds

00:38:53.840 --> 00:38:55.840
 or maybe a bit longer, maybe a minute or two,

00:38:55.840 --> 00:38:58.840
 then you'll get a beep on your phone saying your fly is low.

00:38:58.840 --> 00:39:00.840
 You need to look at it now.

00:39:00.840 --> 00:39:01.840
 Is it called the "WiFly"?

00:39:01.840 --> 00:39:03.840
 It's called the "WiFly".

00:39:03.840 --> 00:39:04.840
 Oh, beautiful.

00:39:04.840 --> 00:39:05.840
 It's really good.

00:39:05.840 --> 00:39:06.840
 I read an article about James.

00:39:06.840 --> 00:39:09.840
 It did sound like there were a couple of disadvantages.

00:39:09.840 --> 00:39:12.840
 I like to gawk around with my fly is undone, for example.

00:39:15.840 --> 00:39:19.840
 It's constantly monitoring, so your phone battery lasts about half an hour while you're using it.

00:39:19.840 --> 00:39:21.840
 Also, you can't watch the jeans anymore

00:39:21.840 --> 00:39:23.840
 because there are powerful magnets inside the zip.

00:39:23.840 --> 00:39:25.840
 But it's teething troubles.

00:39:25.840 --> 00:39:27.840
 Yeah, I'm trying those out.

00:39:27.840 --> 00:39:30.840
 What's the problem with your fly is that it's not that big a thing that you'd...

00:39:30.840 --> 00:39:33.840
 Would you ever get an app just to... I mean, who cares?

00:39:33.840 --> 00:39:35.840
 Someone will tell you, right?

00:39:35.840 --> 00:39:36.840
 I guess so.

00:39:36.840 --> 00:39:38.840
 Maybe someone will go sort that out.

00:39:38.840 --> 00:39:40.840
 If you're somewhere quite...

00:39:40.840 --> 00:39:42.840
 If you're somewhere quite, like, urban, though, often people don't tell you

00:39:42.840 --> 00:39:45.840
 because people talk to you like you're strangers.

00:39:45.840 --> 00:39:48.840
 Yeah, if you're a primary school teacher, that's a problem.

00:39:48.840 --> 00:39:49.840
 Yeah.

00:39:49.840 --> 00:39:51.840
 But just day-to-day.

00:39:51.840 --> 00:39:52.840
 Yeah, I don't know.

00:39:52.840 --> 00:39:53.840
 I do see that.

00:39:53.840 --> 00:39:57.840
 But yeah, like you say, because you can't wash it, that's going to be a problem.

00:39:57.840 --> 00:40:01.840
 And it reminds me of they did make some robotic trousers for old people.

00:40:01.840 --> 00:40:02.840
 Do you remember this?

00:40:02.840 --> 00:40:03.840
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:40:03.840 --> 00:40:04.840
 And they were really good.

00:40:04.840 --> 00:40:07.840
 Obviously, they wanted to stop old people from falling over,

00:40:07.840 --> 00:40:11.840
 so they made this kind of exoskeleton which would help them to walk.

00:40:11.840 --> 00:40:13.840
 And it was absolutely brilliant, it worked really well,

00:40:13.840 --> 00:40:15.840
 but the problem was that you couldn't wash them

00:40:15.840 --> 00:40:18.840
 and they couldn't stop the old people from trying to wash them,

00:40:18.840 --> 00:40:20.840
 no matter what they said to them.

00:40:20.840 --> 00:40:22.840
 They just kept putting them in the washing machine.

00:40:22.840 --> 00:40:25.840
 They're often shitting themselves.

00:40:25.840 --> 00:40:27.840
 We're really living in a sort of golden...

00:40:27.840 --> 00:40:31.840
 unrecognized, I would say, golden age of innovation in the app world.

00:40:31.840 --> 00:40:35.840
 So one that I found is Airbnb.

00:40:35.840 --> 00:40:40.840
 So like Airbnb, but Airbnb is for people who hate public toilets

00:40:40.840 --> 00:40:44.840
 and there are people in the local area who've put their apartment

00:40:44.840 --> 00:40:46.840
 listed just as the toilets.

00:40:46.840 --> 00:40:47.840
 No.

00:40:47.840 --> 00:40:49.840
 So you can go and you can just...

00:40:49.840 --> 00:40:52.840
 It's like me being at home and someone knocking on the door and go,

00:40:52.840 --> 00:40:54.840
 "Oh, we got an Airbnb appointment."

00:40:54.840 --> 00:40:57.840
 And they come in and take a piss in my toilet and then head off.

00:40:57.840 --> 00:40:58.840
 No.

00:40:58.840 --> 00:40:59.840
 And we give each other a review.

00:40:59.840 --> 00:41:01.840
 What's the review?

00:41:01.840 --> 00:41:04.840
 I think that is run by perverts.

00:41:04.840 --> 00:41:05.840
 It's got to be.

00:41:05.840 --> 00:41:08.840
 As a woman, there's no way you go to a stranger's house to use the toilet.

00:41:08.840 --> 00:41:09.840
 I don't think so.

00:41:09.840 --> 00:41:10.840
 No, good point.

00:41:10.840 --> 00:41:14.840
 Not even if they were like 4.9 stars.

00:41:14.840 --> 00:41:16.840
 Have you never killed anyone?

00:41:16.840 --> 00:41:18.840
 Oh, boffin.

00:41:18.840 --> 00:41:20.840
 Yeah, no, there's a really good point.

00:41:20.840 --> 00:41:24.840
 I think it's more the ideas that I find interesting than the practicality of it.

00:41:24.840 --> 00:41:25.840
 Yeah.

00:41:25.840 --> 00:41:27.840
 Have you put your home on Airbnb?

00:41:27.840 --> 00:41:30.840
 No, not yet, but it was my...

00:41:30.840 --> 00:41:35.840
 Because it was my dream.

00:41:35.840 --> 00:41:37.840
 Well, I was in a bit of London once.

00:41:37.840 --> 00:41:39.840
 It was near a park and there were no toilets around.

00:41:39.840 --> 00:41:40.840
 And I thought, "You know, I should do it.

00:41:40.840 --> 00:41:44.840
 I should just open up a toilet and I'll sit in there.

00:41:44.840 --> 00:41:49.840
 Like I'm Ted Dancing in Cheers and people come in and they'll have a pee and we'll chat

00:41:49.840 --> 00:41:50.840
 and then they'll go out.

00:41:50.840 --> 00:41:54.840
 I'll charge them, I don't know, 20 quid of piss and stuff like that."

00:41:54.840 --> 00:41:56.840
 Well, they're getting a good chat, aren't they?

00:41:56.840 --> 00:41:57.840
 Yeah, exactly.

00:41:57.840 --> 00:42:01.840
 Who would pay 20 quid to have a brief chat with you and then a piss?

00:42:01.840 --> 00:42:02.840
 Yep.

00:42:02.840 --> 00:42:04.840
 I mean, you've invented the public toilet there.

00:42:04.840 --> 00:42:05.840
 I don't think you know.

00:42:05.840 --> 00:42:06.840
 No, no, no.

00:42:06.840 --> 00:42:08.840
 Because that's dirty and disgusting, the public toilet.

00:42:08.840 --> 00:42:10.840
 And there might be people in there who are naughty.

00:42:10.840 --> 00:42:11.840
 And so this is...

00:42:11.840 --> 00:42:13.840
 What's the point at me when you say that?

00:42:13.840 --> 00:42:15.840
 I was referring back to your point.

00:42:15.840 --> 00:42:16.840
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:42:16.840 --> 00:42:19.840
 So this would be guaranteed a high-class...

00:42:19.840 --> 00:42:21.840
 No one ever opens a public toilet.

00:42:21.840 --> 00:42:22.840
 No one ever...

00:42:22.840 --> 00:42:23.840
 Exactly.

00:42:23.840 --> 00:42:26.840
 Nobody ever opens a public toilet saying, "Well, in two weeks this is going to be a disgraceful

00:42:26.840 --> 00:42:27.840
 to be a disgraceful...

00:42:27.840 --> 00:42:28.840
 No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

00:42:28.840 --> 00:42:29.840
 no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

00:42:29.840 --> 00:42:30.840
 no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

00:42:30.840 --> 00:42:31.840
 no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

00:42:31.840 --> 00:42:31.840
 no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

00:42:31.840 --> 00:42:54.840
 No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

00:42:54.840 --> 00:43:12.840
 no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

00:43:12.840 --> 00:43:19.240
 random calls with strangers. So if I go to a public toilet, might someone chat to me while I'm there?

00:43:19.240 --> 00:43:26.760
 I'm just thinking. On Wanky? On Wanky, yeah. That's Wanky, I think. That's a very different app.

00:43:26.760 --> 00:43:32.520
 There's a few other apps which I think are really cool. So there's an app that can blow out candles.

00:43:32.520 --> 00:43:39.000
 What? Yeah, isn't that really cool? So it's called the Blower app and it's a... You must have been

00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:44.120
 disappointed when you downloaded that. Your mum designed it.

00:43:44.120 --> 00:43:53.240
 It's basically, it's an extraordinary kind of innovation where certain frequencies are

00:43:53.240 --> 00:43:58.920
 generated by the app. That means that the phone itself shakes in such a way and where there are

00:43:58.920 --> 00:44:05.800
 the holes for the speakers, it turns the air that's inside into being propelled out strong enough

00:44:05.800 --> 00:44:10.760
 that it can blow out a candle. Wow. So you can use it, yeah. But why can't you just blow out your

00:44:10.760 --> 00:44:20.600
 own candles? Well, it's... That's not the spirit that, you know, conquered the American frontier,

00:44:20.600 --> 00:44:25.640
 is it? Let's do things the way we've done them in the past. No, let's make the phone app do it.

00:44:25.640 --> 00:44:30.040
 Let's make the phone app conquer the American frontier for us. We did say in the past that when

00:44:30.040 --> 00:44:34.840
 you blow out candles on a cake, it puts loads of germs all over the cake. So it's a bad thing to do.

00:44:34.840 --> 00:44:40.840
 You don't think that's covered in germs? Well, I did read there was a study of 3,500

00:44:40.840 --> 00:44:46.680
 swabs taken from people's phones and they found nine unstudied branches of bacterial life,

00:44:46.680 --> 00:44:53.800
 including many species of bacteria that were unknown to science. Wow. They found one species

00:44:53.800 --> 00:44:58.520
 of Edwards bacteria that had only previously been known in an underground water aquifer

00:44:58.520 --> 00:45:04.040
 and another one that was only found previously in abandoned gold mines. Wow. And they're just on

00:45:04.040 --> 00:45:09.720
 your phone. That's amazing, isn't it? Like, that's quite nice in a way. I feel like I'm harboring

00:45:09.720 --> 00:45:15.720
 interesting things. Oh, yeah. We all feel that. I know what you mean. It is kind of nice in a way,

00:45:15.720 --> 00:45:22.120
 but we don't know whether how safe it is, I suppose. Do you know the word fly? For your zip?

00:45:22.120 --> 00:45:27.400
 Or for anything? Yeah, fly. Do you know what the word fly originally meant? Did it mean a zip? Did it

00:45:27.400 --> 00:45:33.240
 mean the insect or did it mean to fly around somewhere? Oh, looking cool. Oh, looking cool.

00:45:33.240 --> 00:45:38.040
 There's four options. Which one do you think came first? I'd guess to fly. To fly as in the verb,

00:45:38.040 --> 00:45:44.040
 yeah. Well, weirdly enough, it was the insect that came first and then it came to mean like flapping

00:45:44.040 --> 00:45:51.240
 your wings or flapping things and then it came to mean flying as in the verb to fly. And the reason

00:45:51.240 --> 00:45:57.640
 that you have a fly on your trousers, the fly is not the zipper. It's the bit that covers the zipper

00:45:57.640 --> 00:46:02.680
 and that's because it kind of flaps in the wind like the front of a tent. So where you have the

00:46:02.680 --> 00:46:06.840
 zipper of a tent, you have a little bit of cloth and that flaps in the wind. Oh, yeah. And that was

00:46:06.840 --> 00:46:11.320
 named a fly because it flaps and then the front of your trousers was named a fly because it looks

00:46:11.320 --> 00:46:17.560
 like the front of a tent. So tents came before trousers? Before flies were named, yeah. Well,

00:46:17.560 --> 00:46:23.320
 that in itself is a very exciting fact. Do you not think? Oh, yeah, I'm aroused.

00:46:23.320 --> 00:46:30.840
 I found a couple of new apps that are launched, one new app that's launched this summer, which is

00:46:30.840 --> 00:46:35.080
 quite exciting. I've actually got it on my phone now so I can answer questions about it. It's called

00:46:35.080 --> 00:46:44.440
 Text with Jesus. Oh, lovely. And it's recreated our Lord as a chat GPT guy and you can write,

00:46:44.440 --> 00:46:49.560
 you can ask questions and he'll answer you. And you get lots of people. You get Jesus, Moses,

00:46:49.560 --> 00:46:57.400
 the Virgin Mary, Abraham's nephew, Lot. Was he the one who got turned into a pillar of salt?

00:46:57.400 --> 00:47:00.920
 That was Lot's wife, I think. Oh, is it? But you can ask Lot what was it like when your wife was

00:47:00.920 --> 00:47:05.800
 turned into a pillar of salt. And basically they write back quite convincing answers. They're

00:47:05.800 --> 00:47:10.040
 quite realistic. Got any examples? Hang on, I have to dig out, sorry, because I have been chatting to

00:47:10.040 --> 00:47:17.400
 them. Mary Magdalene cost $2.99 a month because various people are locked on the thing so you

00:47:17.400 --> 00:47:22.600
 can't access. How much is Jesus? Jesus is free. Jesus is part of the package. That's good message.

00:47:22.600 --> 00:47:27.800
 Jesus is free. Of the Apostles, only Peter is free and everyone else is locked.

00:47:27.800 --> 00:47:33.800
 John the Baptist, Abraham. Judas on there. Judas Iscariot is on there. How much?

00:47:35.160 --> 00:47:42.760
 He's 30 pieces of silver. I don't get so much Judas material these days.

00:47:42.760 --> 00:47:52.120
 I chatted a bit up to Job. Oh, God, is he having a tough time, I guess? He is when he's chatting to me.

00:47:52.120 --> 00:47:56.920
 That legendary patience is wearing very thin.

00:48:02.200 --> 00:48:08.840
 He's finally given up on God now, hasn't he? Also, when you look at the messages, he's written

00:48:08.840 --> 00:48:14.600
 quite a lot. That's a joke. That's a joke. That's a joke. Job's is a single line answer and he's like

00:48:14.600 --> 00:48:23.960
 ten lines per message. My opening gambit with Job was, "What joke should I get? Ha, ha, ha.

00:48:23.960 --> 00:48:28.600
 Sunglasses emoji." Job replied, "Ha, ha. I see what you did there." Well,

00:48:29.640 --> 00:48:34.920
 I said to some detail, we're playing. Hang on, who is, is that all the long message,

00:48:34.920 --> 00:48:38.760
 is that Joe? The long message was, "I'm not writing an essay to Joe."

00:48:38.760 --> 00:48:43.560
 What does Job think of the podcast? Can you ask? I can ask, yeah.

00:48:43.560 --> 00:48:47.400
 Yeah, do that live and let's find out. Also, can you ask Job why he's so clingy?

00:48:47.400 --> 00:48:54.040
 As an ancient figure, I must admit that I'm not familiar with modern podcasts like no such thing

00:48:54.040 --> 00:49:05.080
 as a fish. Oh, muttered. That's going on the poster. It's no, "My dad wrote a porno," of course.

00:49:05.080 --> 00:49:10.360
 Is that why he's put "seriously?" No, it's not why he's put "seriously."

00:49:10.360 --> 00:49:15.400
 He says, "From what I gather, this is what it is," and they discuss interesting and unusual facts.

00:49:15.400 --> 00:49:19.640
 Podcasts like these can be great for expanding your knowledge, discovering fascinating tidbits,

00:49:19.640 --> 00:49:23.960
 and even sparking curiosity. If you enjoy learning new things, don't laugh sarcastically at that.

00:49:23.960 --> 00:49:28.440
 If you enjoy learning new things in an entertaining way, it sounds like no such

00:49:28.440 --> 00:49:32.680
 thing as a fish could be right up your alley. Nice. Of course, everyone's taste is stiffer.

00:49:32.680 --> 00:49:45.160
 Okay, that's it. That is all of our facts. Thank you so much for listening. If you'd like to get in

00:49:45.160 --> 00:49:48.520
 contact with any of us about the things that we've said over the course of this podcast,

00:49:48.520 --> 00:49:52.040

00:49:54.920 --> 00:49:56.760
 @LewSanders, we think.

00:49:56.760 --> 00:49:58.520
 What do you mean?

00:49:58.520 --> 00:50:03.320
 Well, I don't know what my Twitter name is. But also, you looked at me like that was incorrect,

00:50:03.320 --> 00:50:04.520
 and I trust you more than me.

00:50:04.520 --> 00:50:12.440
 That alone, myself, was doing.

00:50:12.440 --> 00:50:17.480
 Or you can go to our group account, which is @NoSuchThing, or our website.

00:50:17.480 --> 00:50:23.240
 NoSuchThing is a fish.com. All of our previous episodes are there, so do check them out. Of course,

00:50:23.240 --> 00:50:27.480
