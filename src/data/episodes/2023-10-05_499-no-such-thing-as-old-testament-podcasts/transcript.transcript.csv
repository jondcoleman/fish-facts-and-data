00:00:00,00:00:05,Hi everyone and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish where we were joined
00:00:05,00:00:11,"by none other than Lou Sanders, one of the funniest people I know."
00:00:11,00:00:14,You'll know Lou from all sorts of TV stuff.
00:00:14,00:00:20,"She was on Taskmaster, she's been on QI many times, she's just a really, really, really"
00:00:20,00:00:21,funny person.
00:00:21,00:00:25,"We had such a good laugh with her making this show in the Soho Theatre last month, but what"
00:00:25,00:00:30,I really want to say and what is very important is that Lou has a brand new book out.
00:00:30,00:00:33,The book is called What That Lady Doing.
00:00:33,00:00:39,"It's a really, really great book about how she maybe used to be a little bit unhinged"
00:00:39,00:00:43,and now channels all that unhingedness into amazing comedy.
00:00:43,00:00:47,"It's so well written, I really highly recommend it."
00:00:47,00:00:53,But one thing I should also say while we're talking about books is that Anna and I have
00:00:53,00:00:58,"written our own book, it's called Everything to Play For, the QI book of sport."
00:00:58,00:01:02,"It's for people who like sports, it's even for people who don't like sports, who just"
00:01:02,00:01:05,want to read a load of interesting stories and fun facts.
00:01:05,00:01:08,"I mean, it's from me and Anna, you know what you're going to get."
00:01:08,00:01:13,"And it comes out next Thursday, but the reason we wanted to mention it now is because if you"
00:01:13,00:01:22,"go to Waterstones and you put in the offer code QISport23, then you will get 25% off"
00:01:22,00:01:26,"and that is a deal for pre-order only, so you need to do that before Thursday if you"
00:01:26,00:01:29,want to get our book for a quarter off.
00:01:29,00:01:34,"Anyway, more importantly really for this week is you must go and check out Lou Sanders book"
00:01:34,00:01:40,"What That Lady Doing, that's available right now in all bookshops and all online places"
00:01:40,00:01:56,"where you get your books, hope you enjoy the show on with a podcast."
00:01:56,00:02:01,"Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast this"
00:02:01,00:02:12,week coming to you live from the Soho Theater in London.
00:02:12,00:02:17,"My name is Dan Schreiber and I'm sitting here with James Harkin, Andrew Hunter Murray"
00:02:17,00:02:22,and Lou Sanders and once again we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite
00:02:22,00:02:27,"facts from the last seven days and in no particular order, here we go."
00:02:27,00:02:33,"Starting with fact number one and that is my fact, my fact this week is that names of"
00:02:33,00:02:42,"registered competitive roller derby players include Skatebush, Venus Thytrap, Camille"
00:02:42,00:02:49,"Toe, Alice in Wunderland and Weird Al Spankabitch."
00:02:49,00:02:59,Very rude but this is the most fun naming convention I think I've ever discovered which
00:02:59,00:03:03,is the amazing sport of roller derby largely takes place in America.
00:03:03,00:03:08,They have this huge registry of names where when you join you almost get like a WWF wrestling
00:03:08,00:03:13,"name, you pick it for yourself, you put it forward and you get added to this big register"
00:03:13,00:03:18,"and then when you're out there that's who you are, that's who you embody and there's"
00:03:18,00:03:22,"something like 40,000 names that have been put over various different lists over the"
00:03:22,00:03:23,years.
00:03:23,00:03:29,"They're so good, the names are so good, it's a huge list and you can waste a lot of time"
00:03:29,00:03:31,as I did.
00:03:31,00:03:38,"So HP Shovecraft, Roldemort, that's a good one and some of them are just like pure on,"
00:03:38,00:03:47,"like there are some just violent ones, Affirmative Smaction, Agatha Crushty, Al Strapone, a bit"
00:03:47,00:03:48,of a stretch.
00:03:48,00:03:49,"I think they're going for that, are they?"
00:03:49,00:03:55,"I think it's Al Capone but with the Strapon, there's also Adolf Glitter, Adolf Hitter,"
00:03:55,00:04:02,"Adolf Whistler and Adolf Hitter, I'm sure I think flirting with the taste line, but"
00:04:02,00:04:03,they are good.
00:04:03,00:04:04,And winning.
00:04:04,00:04:09,"It's an amazing spot, it's mostly women who do it, in fact it's almost exclusively women."
00:04:09,00:04:10,Fine.
00:04:10,00:04:14,"Well you do it, you're not roller derby but you're a roller skater."
00:04:14,00:04:17,"Yeah, I know some roller derby people, yeah."
00:04:17,00:04:18,And do you have a name?
00:04:18,00:04:26,"Oh what do we call it, Loose Ends, Loose Ends, Loose Ends because a skating term is to send"
00:04:26,00:04:27,it.
00:04:27,00:04:28,Loose Ends.
00:04:28,00:04:32,"I actually found roller derby names for each of us, it's going through the database."
00:04:32,00:04:41,"So for you, Lou, there is Lou Brickendt and Lou's your daddy, Lou's your daddy's lovely."
00:04:41,00:04:44,"And there's Andy Clockwise, James Bondage andâ€¦"
00:04:44,00:04:47,Do you know what they do in roller derby?
00:04:47,00:04:48,Did you think it's Bondage?
00:04:48,00:04:53,"No, in his fantasies, a little bit different."
00:04:53,00:04:55,Dan Halen or Dansyn Queen?
00:04:55,00:04:56,Dansyn Queen!
00:04:56,00:04:57,Oh that's good.
00:04:57,00:04:58,"Yeah, so yeah."
00:04:58,00:05:03,"But the spot is basically you roller skate around the rink, right, and you've got one"
00:05:03,00:05:09,person who's kind of in charge and who you're trying to protect while the other team are
00:05:09,00:05:12,"trying to get them, basically, it's like that kind of thing, isn't it?"
00:05:12,00:05:16,"And it started off, the whole spot started off as endurance races."
00:05:16,00:05:20,"So in the 1880s, there was this huge thing in America, I think we might have mentioned"
00:05:20,00:05:26,"it before, of women doing six-day races where they would just walk and walk and walk and"
00:05:26,00:05:31,walk again and again and again until basically there was one person left who would just keep
00:05:31,00:05:32,walking and keep walking.
00:05:32,00:05:37,And then they started to do it on roller skates and what they found is that some of the people
00:05:37,00:05:41,who were faster would get around the circuit and start overtaking people and then the people
00:05:41,00:05:45,who were being overtaken would really hate it and so they start knocking them over.
00:05:45,00:05:46,Right.
00:05:46,00:05:49,And they found that people enjoyed that way more than they enjoyed the rest of it.
00:05:49,00:05:53,"They didn't really quite like people just going round in circles loads and loads of times,"
00:05:53,00:05:56,but they loved it when people beat the shit out of each other.
00:05:56,00:05:57,Yeah.
00:05:57,00:06:02,"Well, I can see why though, because the very first one that they did, this is what you"
00:06:02,00:06:09,"would come and watch, people skating, roller skating around a ring, 57,000 times."
00:06:09,00:06:12,"The idea was that they were going across America, that's the thing, they'd worked out how many"
00:06:12,00:06:15,times around the thing was to get from New York to LA or whatever.
00:06:15,00:06:17,"Let's stop for breaks though, right?"
00:06:17,00:06:18,"Yeah, yeah."
00:06:18,00:06:19,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:06:19,00:06:20,Not much.
00:06:20,00:06:21,You wouldn't stop for much breaks.
00:06:21,00:06:25,You stop for just like 20 minutes here or there and you go 24 hours just with the occasional
00:06:25,00:06:26,just stopping for the off-map.
00:06:26,00:06:30,"I think it's a lot more fun now, they're sort of bashing each other out of the way."
00:06:30,00:06:31,Have you done that?
00:06:31,00:06:32,Have you tried that?
00:06:32,00:06:33,"No, but so many people have told me."
00:06:33,00:06:36,"So basically it's quite aggressive sport, like my friends do it and it's like you end"
00:06:36,00:06:41,up with a lot of breakages and stuff and it's often like big units that do it.
00:06:41,00:06:46,And so many people have told me that would be really good at it.
00:06:46,00:06:49,"It's so many, but you should do that."
00:06:49,00:06:52,Do you know what your friends have particular names that...
00:06:52,00:06:57,"Yeah, but I can't remember any of them, but I did write, I only write down two, C-unit,"
00:06:57,00:06:59,but the I is very small so...
00:06:59,00:07:00,C-unit.
00:07:00,00:07:02,"Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:07:02,00:07:08,"And Captain Beaver and I thought, sounds like my love life."
00:07:08,00:07:13,I was chatting to someone called Lin Huynh who was England captain.
00:07:13,00:07:14,"Hang on, is that a joke name or that's...?"
00:07:14,00:07:16,"It's not, it's real, it's her real name."
00:07:16,00:07:17,What's say the name again?
00:07:17,00:07:18,Lin Huynh.
00:07:18,00:07:19,"Oh, OK, Lin Huynh."
00:07:19,00:07:21,I did think you said Lin Huynh and that's why I...
00:07:21,00:07:22,I thought Lin Huynh.
00:07:22,00:07:23,That might have been her fake name.
00:07:23,00:07:27,"No, her fake name was Shaolin Scarlett and she was a captain of the England team in the"
00:07:27,00:07:30,World Cups in 2014 and 2016.
00:07:30,00:07:33,"And I was asking her about how it works, she said, ""Lots of teamwork is really, really"
00:07:33,00:07:35,"important, the teamwork."
00:07:35,00:07:39,"And when they came up with a new tactic, they all get matching tattoos of their tactic"
00:07:39,00:07:41,of Lin Huynh.
00:07:41,00:07:42,"That's pretty hard, Clarice."
00:07:42,00:07:44,"Well, we do that with our facts, don't we?"
00:07:44,00:07:48,"Remember, yeah, we are absolutely coated head-to-toe, they've had to make the font smaller and"
00:07:48,00:07:52,"smaller as the years go by, because they keep thinking we'll stop, but we won't."
00:07:52,00:07:54,Have you got any tattoos?
00:07:54,00:07:56,"Uh, have a guess."
00:07:56,00:07:57,No.
00:07:57,00:07:58,I'll never tell.
00:07:58,00:08:01,"I mean, this is a podcast, you can say what you want."
00:08:01,00:08:04,"Oh, yeah, I got 16 huge ones, yeah."
00:08:04,00:08:05,Got all the lingo.
00:08:05,00:08:06,"No, yeah."
00:08:06,00:08:08,16 big ones.
00:08:08,00:08:12,"That's why you walked into the tattoo place and said, ""Give me 16 big ones."""
00:08:12,00:08:16,"I don't mind what they're of, as long as they're big, yeah."
00:08:16,00:08:19,"Teenage Mutant Inja Turtle, there's another one."
00:08:19,00:08:20,"Oh, very nice."
00:08:20,00:08:23,I thought that was your tattoo.
00:08:23,00:08:25,Two-pack Shanker.
00:08:25,00:08:26,That's clever.
00:08:26,00:08:27,"That's good, yeah."
00:08:27,00:08:28,Twat Rocket.
00:08:28,00:08:29,Don't quite care.
00:08:29,00:08:31,I don't think that one's so clever.
00:08:31,00:08:34,Sounds a bit of life.
00:08:34,00:08:35,The events as well.
00:08:35,00:08:41,"Night of the Rolling Dead, Noctober Fest, Spank's Giving, Season's Beatings."
00:08:41,00:08:42,Okay.
00:08:42,00:08:43,They're great.
00:08:43,00:08:48,"But there were these big mass events earlier, like even in the 19th century, before they"
00:08:48,00:08:51,"started doing proper skating, before these sort of like formal events."
00:08:51,00:08:57,"So in 1884, there was a guy called Victor Clough, who skated 100 miles in 10 hours, like"
00:08:57,00:09:00,"in around a course, which was very impressive."
00:09:00,00:09:05,"And then in 1885, there was a six-day event where they had 36 skaters, again, roller skates"
00:09:05,00:09:06,competing.
00:09:06,00:09:09,"And then soon after that, the winner of the race, who was a guy called William Donovan,"
00:09:09,00:09:12,"and another competitor, died."
00:09:12,00:09:13,Oh.
00:09:13,00:09:14,Yeah.
00:09:14,00:09:18,"And they said, ""Oh, maybe we shouldn't do this for 10 hours a day all the time."""
00:09:18,00:09:20,"Because people just weren't up to it, and they just kept going."
00:09:20,00:09:23,I was reading about the walking version that came before the skating.
00:09:23,00:09:26,"And this was, like I said, it was women doing this for six days at a time."
00:09:26,00:09:28,And it became so popular that there was one stage.
00:09:28,00:09:30,I can't remember where it was.
00:09:30,00:09:33,"But there was a load of kids went missing in an area, and everyone thought, ""Oh, shit,"
00:09:33,00:09:35,"all these kids are gone missing."""
00:09:35,00:09:40,"And what they found is, they were in a warehouse, and they started their own events of walking"
00:09:40,00:09:42,around in circles for days on end.
00:09:42,00:09:45,"And they just were trying to copy what these women were doing, and were like, ""Yeah,"
00:09:45,00:09:46,"let's do it ourselves."""
00:09:46,00:09:49,And they'd been walking around in circles for three days when they were found.
00:09:49,00:09:50,God.
00:09:50,00:09:52,I thought that was going to take a darker turn.
00:09:52,00:09:56,"I thought it was going to be like a roller-skating Pied Piper situation, where the Pied Piper"
00:09:56,00:09:59,"had skated through the town, and all the children had danced."
00:09:59,00:10:01,"Yeah, we thought it was a Jimmy Sapple."
00:10:01,00:10:03,I didn't think that.
00:10:03,00:10:05,Did you hear of Rinkomania?
00:10:05,00:10:06,"No, what's that?"
00:10:06,00:10:09,"This is the Edwardian craze for rinks, skating rinks."
00:10:09,00:10:13,Loads of venues around everywhere used to be rinks that are now converted.
00:10:13,00:10:15,Just because it was so crazy.
00:10:15,00:10:17,"Basically, because you could meet the opposite sex."
00:10:17,00:10:21,"That was the, you're a bit less chaperoned, you're able to skate away from your chaperone."
00:10:21,00:10:26,"I read one article saying, ""Mother Grundy, dare not trust herself on skates."""
00:10:26,00:10:29,"Which meant that some, you know, all the person isn't going to be watching you,"
00:10:29,00:10:31,and making sure what you're doing with the other...
00:10:31,00:10:32,Exactly.
00:10:32,00:10:33,"...the opposite sex, yeah."
00:10:33,00:10:36,"My wife started, I can't believe, I just thought of this just now."
00:10:36,00:10:39,My wife decided to start roller-skating.
00:10:39,00:10:42,And her skate instructor's very upset.
00:10:42,00:10:45,What's her street name?
00:10:45,00:10:47,"Ooh, I'm not sure."
00:10:47,00:10:50,"I don't want to say anything that will mean I can't go home tonight,"
00:10:50,00:10:52,because she's here.
00:10:52,00:10:54,"So, but here's the thing, right?"
00:10:54,00:10:55,So she bought a pair of roller skates.
00:10:55,00:10:57,She hasn't done it since she was a teenager.
00:10:57,00:11:00,"And we're leaving the house, and she starts putting them on."
00:11:00,00:11:01,"And I said, ""What are you doing?"""
00:11:01,00:11:03,"And she was like, ""I'm just going to go and do it now."""
00:11:03,00:11:05,"And I was like, ""You've got to test it out in a park."
00:11:05,00:11:09,"We're on a main road here, and you're going on your own with our child in a buggy."""
00:11:09,00:11:13,"""Wilf was like only a few months, like, you know, nine months old or something like that."""
00:11:13,00:11:15,"So I said, ""Listen, I'd better come with you."""
00:11:15,00:11:16,And she was insistent that she does it.
00:11:16,00:11:19,So she put the roller skates on.
00:11:19,00:11:21,She took the buggy outside.
00:11:21,00:11:23,"And you live at the top of a very steep hill, don't you?"
00:11:23,00:11:25,We do have a bit of an incline on the street.
00:11:25,00:11:28,"And you go everywhere by unicycle as well, don't you?"
00:11:28,00:11:33,"So I closed the door, and all I hear is, ""Ahhh!"""
00:11:33,00:11:37,"And I turn around, and Fenella and the buggy have just gone off."
00:11:37,00:11:40,"And she can't stop, because she doesn't know how to use the brake on the back."
00:11:40,00:11:44,"And I have to chase them down the road as they're heading to oncoming traffic,"
00:11:44,00:11:45,coming on the road.
00:11:45,00:11:48,"Oh, yeah, there's two guys with a glass going across the road."
00:11:48,00:11:49,Wow.
00:11:49,00:11:51,"I love that spirit, though."
00:11:51,00:11:53,That is amazing.
00:11:53,00:11:55,"Oh, can I ask you, have you seen Roller Limbo?"
00:11:55,00:11:56,No.
00:11:56,00:11:58,This is amazing.
00:11:58,00:12:01,"Okay, so it is literally, as it sounds, it's limbo on roller skates."
00:12:01,00:12:03,"Oh, yes, yes."
00:12:03,00:12:05,"You think you know what it is, and you're wrong."
00:12:05,00:12:07,"No, no, no."
00:12:07,00:12:12,"So what you're imagining, maybe, is someone skating towards and then bending backwards."
00:12:12,00:12:13,"That's what I was imagining, yeah."
00:12:13,00:12:14,It's not how you do it.
00:12:14,00:12:18,"You basically, it's so hard to describe, because I'm behind a desk,"
00:12:18,00:12:22,"but basically, your legs go out to the sides, you go down into the splits."
00:12:22,00:12:25,"I'll be honest, Andy, I don't think the fact there's a desk here"
00:12:25,00:12:28,is what makes that difficult for you to imagine.
00:12:28,00:12:31,I so wish I could show you all.
00:12:31,00:12:34,"Well, we have bought some skates for you."
00:12:34,00:12:36,So you're doing the sideways splits.
00:12:36,00:12:38,"You do a sideways splits, but you're moving forwards,"
00:12:38,00:12:41,and you're holding onto your calves.
00:12:41,00:12:45,"I know, and you're going under these bars, which are about, I don't know,"
00:12:45,00:12:48,"20 centimetres high, and you're so low as you head for it."
00:12:48,00:12:50,You've got to look it up. It is so good.
00:12:50,00:12:51,Wow.
00:12:51,00:12:52,It's the most amazing thing.
00:12:52,00:12:55,Those people need to grow up a little bit.
00:12:55,00:12:58,"Well, the competitors are mostly children, so..."
00:12:58,00:13:01,"No, good on them."
00:13:01,00:13:04,Have you heard of Jean-Yves Blondeau?
00:13:04,00:13:05,No.
00:13:05,00:13:09,So Jean-Yves Blondeau has invented a new suit made of plastic
00:13:09,00:13:12,that has 30 roller skates attached to it
00:13:12,00:13:14,in all different parts of his body.
00:13:14,00:13:18,"So wherever he... If he falls over on his back, he can roller skate."
00:13:18,00:13:21,"If he falls on his front, he can roller skate."
00:13:21,00:13:22,Brilliant.
00:13:22,00:13:24,"If he falls on his head, he can roller skate."
00:13:24,00:13:28,He can walk along the wall and roller skate along the wall as he's going.
00:13:28,00:13:29,I can't make it.
00:13:29,00:13:31,He can. There's videos on YouTube.
00:13:31,00:13:32,Wow.
00:13:32,00:13:33,It does it.
00:13:33,00:13:36,Is he using it as powers for good or for evil?
00:13:36,00:13:39,I would say neither good nor evil.
00:13:39,00:13:41,He's just using them for more hits on YouTube.
00:13:41,00:13:42,Can he do it on his head?
00:13:42,00:13:43,That's incredible.
00:13:43,00:13:46,"Yeah, the head one, I probably may be exaggerating a little bit."
00:13:46,00:13:48,"But he could do it in theory, yeah."
00:13:48,00:13:51,And he basically goes down all these really big hills around the world
00:13:51,00:13:53,as quickly as he can on his suit.
00:13:53,00:13:57,"How does he stop? Does he have a break on, like, his elbows or something?"
00:13:57,00:13:59,You know what? I'm not sure.
00:13:59,00:14:01,"He must have some breaks, yeah."
00:14:01,00:14:03,He's still going somewhere right now.
00:14:03,00:14:05,"Actually, you're going against the butt when they help."
00:14:05,00:14:06,You don't need to stop.
00:14:06,00:14:08,"Like, the reason you stop yourself is in case you fall over."
00:14:08,00:14:10,He's already fallen over.
00:14:10,00:14:14,You don't need to stop. There's a big wall there.
00:14:14,00:14:18,You can just go up the wall and then on the side and then on his head and stuff.
00:14:18,00:14:19,It cannot be stopped.
00:14:19,00:14:21,He should be stopped.
00:14:21,00:14:26,"He also has one of his suits, which, these ones you can buy, these 30 ones."
00:14:26,00:14:28,"I don't know how much they are, but they are available."
00:14:28,00:14:31,"But he does have one suit, which isn't for sale,"
00:14:31,00:14:34,but he also features samurai blades and spike horns.
00:14:34,00:14:35,"Oh, my God."
00:14:35,00:14:36,What is that useful for?
00:14:36,00:14:38,"Probably evil, I reckon."
00:14:38,00:14:42,I give him six years of life expectancy.
00:14:42,00:14:43,"Yeah, exactly."
00:14:43,00:14:45,I need to move this on very soon.
00:14:45,00:14:47,I've got a couple of other names that I found.
00:14:47,00:14:48,So here's the thing.
00:14:48,00:14:53,There's a lot of extremely rude names on this registry.
00:14:53,00:14:56,And it's done in a kind of empowering way.
00:14:56,00:14:59,"I think it's sort of, you know, it's exciting to have these real badass names."
00:14:59,00:15:02,"But, God damn it, they really go for it."
00:15:02,00:15:04,So some of them I discovered.
00:15:04,00:15:06,Bitch Hiker is one.
00:15:06,00:15:07,Okay.
00:15:07,00:15:08,Vagina Might.
00:15:08,00:15:09,"Oh, wow."
00:15:09,00:15:11,Is that like Marmite?
00:15:11,00:15:12,Yeah.
00:15:12,00:15:14,"Yeah, you love it or you hate it."
00:15:14,00:15:18,"It's some kind of yeast extract, I'm not sure."
00:15:18,00:15:25,"Oh, my God."
00:15:25,00:15:28,"Well, this isn't what I expected from this podcast."
00:15:28,00:15:29,Yeah.
00:15:29,00:15:38,"It is time for fact number two, and that is Lou."
00:15:38,00:15:43,"Okay, my fact this week is that the TikTok singer who went viral with The Seashunty"
00:15:43,00:15:46,is unable to perform his song on the boats
00:15:46,00:15:49,because he suffers from terrible seasickness.
00:15:49,00:15:52,"Yeah, it's typhonic."
00:15:52,00:15:54,That's what that is.
00:15:54,00:15:55,It's sweet as well.
00:15:55,00:15:56,It's lame.
00:15:57,00:15:59,"It is sweet, it is sweet actually."
00:15:59,00:16:01,"It was an amazing thing, wasn't it?"
00:16:01,00:16:06,"He basically, it was 2021, he suddenly releases this seashanty called Wellerman"
00:16:06,00:16:11,"and it went to number one, which is, yeah, it went to number one in the UK charts."
00:16:11,00:16:15,It's a song about a whale trawler and they're looking for a whale.
00:16:15,00:16:17,And this was 2021.
00:16:17,00:16:20,"So you would think by now, maybe it's died down a bit,"
00:16:20,00:16:22,but I went on to his Spotify listens.
00:16:22,00:16:27,"Still, as of today, gets five million listens a month on his Spotify account."
00:16:27,00:16:29,That's the same as Tom Jones.
00:16:29,00:16:30,Wow.
00:16:30,00:16:31,Yeah.
00:16:31,00:16:33,So it's not unusual then.
00:16:33,00:16:39,"Don't shake your head at your own, that is really good."
00:16:39,00:16:42,"It's not even a seashanty, is it?"
00:16:42,00:16:43,"No, not really, no."
00:16:43,00:16:45,"No, it isn't, none of these are."
00:16:45,00:16:46,Is it River Shanty?
00:16:46,00:16:47,What is it?
00:16:47,00:16:49,It's just a song.
00:16:50,00:16:54,A seashanty has to be something that you sing when you're working.
00:16:54,00:16:56,"So like Drunk and Sailor is like,"
00:16:56,00:16:58,"""What would you do with a drunk and sailor?"
00:16:58,00:17:00,"You're pulling the rope and you're bringing them to sail."""
00:17:00,00:17:03,"But if he's getting a record deal, he's working sort of on that."
00:17:03,00:17:05,That's a really good point.
00:17:05,00:17:06,Yeah.
00:17:06,00:17:07,He got me there.
00:17:07,00:17:08,"Checkmate, Harkin."
00:17:08,00:17:13,"But that is the cool thing about seashanties, like the old seashanties is that"
00:17:13,00:17:18,"because on a vessel you only had a very skeleton crew that had to do multiple things,"
00:17:18,00:17:22,the song is the beat of allowing you to know how we all work as a group.
00:17:22,00:17:25,"So the rhythm of it, the lyrics of it would mean"
00:17:25,00:17:29,you have to pull at that moment and pull at this or whatever places and whatever.
00:17:29,00:17:31,So people often see it done on like Navy ships.
00:17:31,00:17:33,It never really would have happened on Navy ships
00:17:33,00:17:35,"because they had so much crew, you didn't need this multitasking."
00:17:35,00:17:39,"They were banned, the UK Navy, they were banned seashanties"
00:17:39,00:17:43,because you wouldn't be able to hear commands if you're singing too much.
00:17:43,00:17:45,But you're having a laugh.
00:17:46,00:17:50,"So it's like merchant ships, when wailing ships, things like that."
00:17:50,00:17:53,And there were specific songs for different things you were doing on board.
00:17:53,00:18:01,"So there was hauling shanties, running shanties, pump shanties, swabbing shanties, capstan shanties."
00:18:01,00:18:04,Capstan is that thing you turn around in the middle of the ship that pulls the anchor up.
00:18:04,00:18:05,Oh yeah.
00:18:05,00:18:06,"And all these had their own songs, really."
00:18:06,00:18:07,That's pretty cool.
00:18:07,00:18:09,But it's been like that song that he sang.
00:18:09,00:18:12,It's not like it's an obscure song that's not been around for ages.
00:18:12,00:18:17,"It's one of the better-known sea songs, and you can read a list of places it's appeared."
00:18:17,00:18:22,"So it was in 2013, it was on the album Now That's What I Call Sea Shanties, Volume 1."
00:18:22,00:18:24,"No, no."
00:18:24,00:18:25,Yeah.
00:18:25,00:18:26,I found that.
00:18:26,00:18:28,Did you find the Volume 2?
00:18:28,00:18:29,"Yeah, I did."
00:18:29,00:18:30,No.
00:18:30,00:18:31,"Yeah, it's on Spotify."
00:18:31,00:18:33,Not as many listeners as Tom Jones.
00:18:33,00:18:34,But it's doing okay.
00:18:34,00:18:38,"To be fair, it's a great title, and it's not multiple different sea shanty acts."
00:18:38,00:18:44,It's just the one band from Wellington in New Zealand called Wellington Sea Shanties Society.
00:18:44,00:18:46,But there is a whole genre.
00:18:46,00:18:49,And how did they get that name?
00:18:49,00:18:56,"There is a whole niche genre of pirate metal, and they sing Wellerman as well, this song."
00:18:56,00:18:59,It's a Scottish band called Ayle Storm and Stormseeker.
00:18:59,00:19:02,"They've been known to sing this song, so it's been around."
00:19:02,00:19:05,"So how come he gets all the money for it then, just because he made it popular?"
00:19:05,00:19:10,"Yeah, it's a traditional song, and so traditional songs, I don't think there's any copyright over..."
00:19:10,00:19:12,"I'm not sure if that's right, I think that's what's right."
00:19:12,00:19:13,"Yeah, you're right."
00:19:13,00:19:16,"I think you do get royalties, but you have to bury them on a remote island."
00:19:16,00:19:19,That's quite a pain in the arse actually.
00:19:19,00:19:21,"Okay, a little quiz question for you."
00:19:21,00:19:25,"When did the last actual proper shanty man, not like modern singers,"
00:19:25,00:19:27,when did the last proper shanty man die?
00:19:27,00:19:28,Oh.
00:19:28,00:19:32,"Oh, well, I would have thought probably 18th century."
00:19:32,00:19:33,"Okay, any advancements?"
00:19:33,00:19:35,"1992, 1992."
00:19:35,00:19:36,"1992, okay."
00:19:36,00:19:39,"Yeah, 1993."
00:19:39,00:19:42,We're just having a laugh.
00:19:42,00:19:45,"Well, Lou, you're correct, because he died in 1992."
00:19:45,00:19:48,Thank you.
00:19:48,00:19:51,"Are you joking, Lou?"
00:19:51,00:19:52,"No, I'm not joking."
00:19:52,00:19:59,"I was, as you said it, I was like, keep the poker face, keep, like, don't give away shit."
00:19:59,00:20:00,She's got it.
00:20:00,00:20:02,I didn't look at his notes or anything.
00:20:02,00:20:03,Stanley Hougill.
00:20:03,00:20:04,I knew that.
00:20:04,00:20:06,He was born in 1906.
00:20:06,00:20:08,"He was at sea in 1922, at the end of '16."
00:20:08,00:20:09,He's got to be.
00:20:09,00:20:10,Yeah.
00:20:10,00:20:13,"And then he was the shanty man on the last ever British sailing ship,"
00:20:13,00:20:16,"which was called the Garth Pool, and that was on its last voyage."
00:20:16,00:20:18,And that ship was wrecked in 1929.
00:20:18,00:20:19,And then he lived his whole life.
00:20:19,00:20:20,He was in the Sakawa War.
00:20:20,00:20:21,He settled down.
00:20:21,00:20:23,"You know, he wrote down all his shanties,"
00:20:23,00:20:25,because it looked like they're all traditional.
00:20:25,00:20:26,There wasn't this proper songbook.
00:20:26,00:20:27,Wow.
00:20:27,00:20:29,And he died in 1992.
00:20:29,00:20:30,Wow.
00:20:30,00:20:31,Yeah.
00:20:31,00:20:34,"And you won't like this, but this is not really yours at back."
00:20:34,00:20:36,But I do think I'm a bit psychic.
00:20:36,00:20:40,Were you talking about sitting right next to the person
00:20:40,00:20:42,who absolutely loves hearing that kind of stuff?
00:20:42,00:20:44,Why do you think you're psychic?
00:20:44,00:20:46,You think you pulled that out of Andy's head just now?
00:20:46,00:20:47,"Yeah, basically."
00:20:47,00:20:49,And I'm very emotionally intelligent.
00:20:49,00:20:55,"But you don't even believe in UFOs, so I'm not going to continue."
00:20:55,00:20:57,I said that to you in private backstage.
00:20:58,00:21:02,That's true.
00:21:02,00:21:05,He said he doesn't believe in UFOs and he hates women.
00:21:05,00:21:15,Only one of those things is true.
00:21:15,00:21:17,He's a lovely lad.
00:21:17,00:21:19,"Oh, dear."
00:21:19,00:21:20,"Oh, wow."
00:21:20,00:21:21,Just joking.
00:21:21,00:21:22,Punishment.
00:21:22,00:21:23,Anyone?
00:21:23,00:21:25,I think that's actually...
00:21:25,00:21:27,I kind of feel like I've had enough.
00:21:27,00:21:30,This is to do with music and the army.
00:21:30,00:21:33,So corporal punishment in the British army
00:21:33,00:21:36,was often meted out by drummers and bands people.
00:21:36,00:21:37,You were the drum.
00:21:37,00:21:38,In a way.
00:21:38,00:21:40,I suppose in a way you were.
00:21:40,00:21:43,The cat of nine tails is the drumsticks.
00:21:43,00:21:44,It was like rhythm.
00:21:44,00:21:46,"Well, no, it wasn't so much that."
00:21:46,00:21:47,It was probably...
00:21:47,00:21:49,There was two possible reasons.
00:21:49,00:21:51,"One, that other musicians would play music"
00:21:51,00:21:54,and it would drown out the screams of the person being punished.
00:21:54,00:21:55,Punished.
00:21:55,00:21:58,But probably because just the people who were drummers
00:21:58,00:22:01,"or in the band, they were not proper sailors."
00:22:01,00:22:04,And so they were like the lowest of the low of the...
00:22:04,00:22:06,"As far as, you know, who's the most senior."
00:22:06,00:22:08,"And so the idea was if you were a sailor,"
00:22:08,00:22:11,you wouldn't want to be meeting out punishment to your...
00:22:11,00:22:13,to your peers.
00:22:13,00:22:15,And so maybe you would get the person at the bottom to do it.
00:22:15,00:22:18,And that apparently is where we get the idea of being drummed out.
00:22:18,00:22:21,So being drummed out of the army is because it was the drummer
00:22:21,00:22:23,who would do the beating.
00:22:23,00:22:25,So they're actually beating you?
00:22:25,00:22:27,"Yeah, with the cat of nine tails, like..."
00:22:27,00:22:29,"Oh, I see. OK, OK, OK."
00:22:29,00:22:32,And do you know what a boy's pussy is?
00:22:32,00:22:34,So...
00:22:34,00:22:37,It's a former champion roller derby...
00:22:37,00:22:39,..winner.
00:22:39,00:22:43,"No, just on topic, it was a cat of nine tails,"
00:22:43,00:22:45,but for younger recruits.
00:22:45,00:22:48,"So if you're a young person who joined the army,"
00:22:48,00:22:51,"you weren't of age, perhaps, they would have a..."
00:22:51,00:22:54,"Like, a cat of nine tails would have nine, like, whips on it,"
00:22:54,00:22:56,"and there would be knots on it,"
00:22:56,00:22:59,"but yours would only have five, and it'd be made of smooth cod."
00:22:59,00:23:01,"Oh, that's nice, isn't it?"
00:23:01,00:23:03,"Wow. Yeah, boy's pussy."
00:23:03,00:23:05,Crikey.
00:23:05,00:23:08,Have you ever heard the sea shanty come all you tongueers?
00:23:08,00:23:10,No.
00:23:10,00:23:12,Sing it. Just good. I can't sing it.
00:23:12,00:23:14,Is it the same as come all you faithful?
00:23:14,00:23:17,It's about the tongueers with the guys on board ship
00:23:17,00:23:20,who collected stray intestines of whales floating around.
00:23:20,00:23:22,Wow. Yeah.
00:23:22,00:23:25,"I think in Wellerman, he says, ""We'll get the tonguing done,"""
00:23:25,00:23:27,"or something like that. Yeah, he does, exactly."
00:23:27,00:23:29,"So that's what that means. That's what that means, yeah."
00:23:29,00:23:31,That's very cool. Not a lovely job.
00:23:31,00:23:33,I got a fact about whales singing.
00:23:33,00:23:36,"Actual whales and whale songs, so I love this."
00:23:36,00:23:39,"Okay, whale song spreads like human songs,"
00:23:39,00:23:41,so the scientists found there was a...
00:23:41,00:23:44,"Basically, there was a hit whale song among humpback whales"
00:23:44,00:23:46,in the West Coast of Australia.
00:23:46,00:23:49,"It was only found there, but then several months later,"
00:23:49,00:23:51,"they heard that same song on the East Coast,"
00:23:51,00:23:54,"and this happens in the Atlantic too,"
00:23:54,00:23:57,and basically hit whale songs make their way from West to East.
00:23:57,00:23:59,"So you will get whales in the East,"
00:23:59,00:24:01,"which are still singing the old songs,"
00:24:01,00:24:04,"but the whales in the West have a new song by now,"
00:24:04,00:24:06,"and it gradually spreads across,"
00:24:06,00:24:08,"and it's always West to East, and we don't know why."
00:24:08,00:24:10,Wow. That is incredible.
00:24:10,00:24:12,"Imagine like the radar was singing,"
00:24:12,00:24:16,"""It's not on you, it's on you!"""
00:24:16,00:24:19,He's got to get those photo-fine numbers from somewhere.
00:24:19,00:24:21,This is a cool thing.
00:24:21,00:24:23,"There's seasickness we're talking about,"
00:24:23,00:24:25,but there's other kinds of sickness that you can get.
00:24:25,00:24:26,Motion sickness.
00:24:26,00:24:28,"Seasickness is one of the motion sicknesses, right?"
00:24:28,00:24:29,Love sickness.
00:24:29,00:24:31,We don't know who the person loves sickness.
00:24:31,00:24:32,"Yeah, yeah, sorry, yeah, go."
00:24:32,00:24:33,What? Is that a thing?
00:24:33,00:24:35,I thought you were wanting us to join in with more kinds of sickness.
00:24:35,00:24:36,Is that a sickness?
00:24:36,00:24:37,"Yeah, it was."
00:24:37,00:24:39,Is love sickness not a thing?
00:24:39,00:24:41,This is this lucky guy.
00:24:42,00:24:47,"It was a proper thing in the 19th century, wasn't it?"
00:24:47,00:24:48,Love sickness.
00:24:48,00:24:52,They thought that it meant if you had like a pallid expression
00:24:52,00:24:55,"and like just deep sun-kais and stuff,"
00:24:55,00:24:57,that's because you were love sick.
00:24:57,00:24:58,It was supposed to be a thing.
00:24:58,00:25:00,"Okay, so with all the sicknesses,"
00:25:00,00:25:02,it's probably impossible to ever say
00:25:02,00:25:04,this was the first person who ever had seasickness.
00:25:04,00:25:07,"This is the first person who had love sickness, right?"
00:25:07,00:25:10,But we do know the person who had the first sickness of one kind.
00:25:10,00:25:12,So I'll give you the name.
00:25:12,00:25:14,He's called German Titov.
00:25:14,00:25:16,What did Titov have the sickness?
00:25:16,00:25:17,"Okay, herpes."
00:25:17,00:25:19,Herpes sickness.
00:25:19,00:25:22,Titov presumably space race.
00:25:22,00:25:23,There we go.
00:25:23,00:25:24,What? What?
00:25:24,00:25:25,Space sickness.
00:25:25,00:25:27,First person to ever have space sickness.
00:25:27,00:25:28,How do you know that?
00:25:28,00:25:30,I feel I'm a bit psychic.
00:25:30,00:25:38,"It could be all the Russian history I've read,"
00:25:38,00:25:40,but I think it's a psychic-sacr-ness.
00:25:40,00:25:44,"So Titov, he was..."
00:25:44,00:25:47,Libbit.
00:25:47,00:25:49,"Wow, I can't read minds yet."
00:25:49,00:25:51,I know what you're thinking right now.
00:25:51,00:25:55,"Yeah, but you're saying that because you've read it,"
00:25:55,00:25:56,"you're not psychic,"
00:25:56,00:25:58,but I've never read a book of my life.
00:25:58,00:25:59,I'll just play that.
00:25:59,00:26:00,"You've written one, yeah."
00:26:00,00:26:01,"Yeah, I've written one."
00:26:01,00:26:03,"So 1961, August,"
00:26:03,00:26:06,"German Titov is the, I think, the fourth human,"
00:26:06,00:26:08,certainly one of the first batches of human
00:26:08,00:26:10,to go up and orbit the Earth.
00:26:10,00:26:12,"And he's the first person who up there gets,"
00:26:12,00:26:14,"well, space sickness and vomits,"
00:26:14,00:26:16,the first-ever human to vomit in space.
00:26:16,00:26:17,"Oh, really?"
00:26:17,00:26:18,"So it's a landmark thing,"
00:26:18,00:26:20,"and it affects so many people,"
00:26:20,00:26:22,"so many astronauts who go up there,"
00:26:22,00:26:23,and it's for the opposite reason
00:26:23,00:26:25,that you might get C sickness
00:26:25,00:26:27,or any kind of motion sickness on Earth.
00:26:27,00:26:29,"You have an opposite effect, right?"
00:26:29,00:26:31,"I don't know the proper science,"
00:26:31,00:26:33,"but to put it in context,"
00:26:33,00:26:34,if you were in a car
00:26:34,00:26:35,"and you were reading your phone or a book,"
00:26:35,00:26:37,"you might get motion sickness,"
00:26:37,00:26:39,because what you're staring at
00:26:39,00:26:40,is counter to everything else
00:26:40,00:26:41,that is in your normal life.
00:26:41,00:26:42,"Like a movement around you,"
00:26:42,00:26:43,you're trying to keep that still?
00:26:43,00:26:44,"Yeah, exactly."
00:26:44,00:26:46,"In space, to get rid of everything moving around"
00:26:46,00:26:48,"because of the lack of gravity,"
00:26:48,00:26:49,you should read a book
00:26:49,00:26:50,and to get yourself--
00:26:50,00:26:52,My book is now available
00:26:52,00:26:53,from all the bookshops.
00:26:53,00:26:54,It's called What's That Lady
00:26:54,00:26:56,Doing Full Starts and Happy Endings.
00:26:56,00:26:58,Cheers.
00:26:58,00:27:00,"Yeah, it's a--"
00:27:00,00:27:03,"And have NASA expressed any interest, Lou?"
00:27:03,00:27:06,They've not expressed interest.
00:27:06,00:27:07,So here's the thing.
00:27:07,00:27:09,They were very worried when it happened to him
00:27:09,00:27:11,because he came back down to Earth
00:27:11,00:27:13,and was space sickness
00:27:13,00:27:15,something that's going to carry through on into life?
00:27:15,00:27:16,"And then suddenly,"
00:27:16,00:27:19,they noticed huge changes in his personality.
00:27:19,00:27:22,He suddenly was sort of like
00:27:22,00:27:24,sleeping around with different women.
00:27:24,00:27:26,He was being really rowdy in bars.
00:27:26,00:27:28,He was like all these different personality traits
00:27:28,00:27:30,"and they thought, ""God, the space sickness has come down."""
00:27:30,00:27:31,So they studied him.
00:27:31,00:27:34,Hang on. Did my dad go up to space?
00:27:34,00:27:40,"That's the missing chapter in your book, isn't it?"
00:27:40,00:27:41,But here's what they worked out.
00:27:41,00:27:43,It wasn't space sickness.
00:27:43,00:27:45,It's just he was a dickhead.
00:27:45,00:27:52,"All right, cool."
00:27:52,00:27:53,We need to move on to our next fact.
00:27:53,00:27:55,It is time for fact number three
00:27:55,00:27:58,and that is Andy.
00:27:58,00:28:00,My fact is that the people of Iceland
00:28:00,00:28:03,can think of a good use for 95% of a cod.
00:28:03,00:28:08,So this is a fact about recycling.
00:28:08,00:28:13,"Do we know, can you tell us what part of a cod there is?"
00:28:13,00:28:14,"Yeah, I was thinking that."
00:28:14,00:28:16,That's stubborn the last few percent.
00:28:16,00:28:19,"Basically, the blood in the eyeballs are quite hard to"
00:28:19,00:28:22,"monetise and make, you know,"
00:28:22,00:28:23,you properly use it.
00:28:23,00:28:24,I've always said that.
00:28:24,00:28:26,Blood in the eyeballs are hard to monetise.
00:28:26,00:28:29,We have said that the aqueous humour in the eye
00:28:29,00:28:31,can be drunk in an emergency.
00:28:31,00:28:33,"Yes, it's just hard to monetise."
00:28:33,00:28:34,"Yeah, it's hard to..."
00:28:34,00:28:35,Monetise emergency.
00:28:35,00:28:37,"Yeah, and there is a use for the blood as well."
00:28:37,00:28:41,"It can be used in sausages or as fish food,"
00:28:41,00:28:44,but it's hard to get fish to collect the blood from them.
00:28:44,00:28:46,"Anyway, basically, this is from a magazine"
00:28:46,00:28:48,"called Hakai Magazine, which we've mentioned before."
00:28:48,00:28:49,Anna's favourite.
00:28:49,00:28:50,Anna's favourite magazine.
00:28:50,00:28:51,Anna's favourite magazine.
00:28:51,00:28:53,"It's all about the sea and everything, nautical"
00:28:53,00:28:54,"and all about water, basically."
00:28:54,00:28:56,"And Iceland catch loads of cod,"
00:28:56,00:28:59,and they didn't use much of it until recently.
00:28:59,00:29:03,They used 40% of the cod in the early 2000s.
00:29:03,00:29:04,Nightmare.
00:29:04,00:29:05,Lots of waste.
00:29:05,00:29:06,Yeah.
00:29:06,00:29:07,"You know, you're using the fillets,"
00:29:07,00:29:08,"so you're eating the meat,"
00:29:08,00:29:09,but not really using it properly.
00:29:09,00:29:12,"So there is a project called 100% Fish,"
00:29:12,00:29:16,"which aims to put all of the cod caught to good use,"
00:29:16,00:29:18,"you know, just use the whole thing,"
00:29:18,00:29:19,which is much more sensible.
00:29:19,00:29:22,"So the skin, if you've had a burn,"
00:29:22,00:29:24,the skin can be grafted onto people now.
00:29:24,00:29:26,So there are people who are part cod.
00:29:26,00:29:27,No.
00:29:27,00:29:28,Yeah.
00:29:28,00:29:29,Really?
00:29:29,00:29:30,And you can see the imprint of the scales as well.
00:29:30,00:29:32,But it's a really good thing for skin grafts.
00:29:32,00:29:33,"Like, it's really, it's really,"
00:29:33,00:29:35,thousands of people have been treated with cod skin.
00:29:35,00:29:37,Would it make you swim faster?
00:29:37,00:29:38,No.
00:29:38,00:29:39,What?
00:29:39,00:29:40,No.
00:29:40,00:29:41,Absolutely not.
00:29:41,00:29:42,Why not?
00:29:42,00:29:43,You're recovering from a major operation.
00:29:43,00:29:44,You've been through hell.
00:29:44,00:29:46,"Suddenly, there's Dr. Harkin at the door saying,"
00:29:46,00:29:48,"""In your speeders, come on."""
00:29:48,00:29:50,"But what I'm thinking is, you could,"
00:29:50,00:29:52,"is there not a way in the Olympics,"
00:29:52,00:29:53,"the next Olympics,"
00:29:53,00:29:55,we put this cod skin on all of our swimmers.
00:29:55,00:29:56,Yeah?
00:29:56,00:29:57,No?
00:29:57,00:29:58,You're right.
00:29:58,00:29:59,"Well, maybe it would."
00:29:59,00:30:00,Maybe it would work.
00:30:00,00:30:01,That's a good point.
00:30:01,00:30:02,I don't know.
00:30:02,00:30:03,But then you retire like age 27.
00:30:03,00:30:05,Did you just cover the con for the rest of your life?
00:30:05,00:30:06,Smelling a fish?
00:30:06,00:30:07,No one wants to hang out with you.
00:30:07,00:30:08,Yeah.
00:30:08,00:30:09,Yeah.
00:30:09,00:30:10,"No, you're right."
00:30:10,00:30:11,Tom Scaly.
00:30:11,00:30:12,Yeah?
00:30:12,00:30:13,Tom Scaly.
00:30:13,00:30:14,Do you get it?
00:30:14,00:30:15,"Oh, yeah."
00:30:15,00:30:16,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:30:16,00:30:17,There's a guy called Tom Daly.
00:30:17,00:30:18,Daly.
00:30:18,00:30:19,"And he's got, yeah."
00:30:19,00:30:20,Do you get it?
00:30:20,00:30:21,Tom Daly.
00:30:21,00:30:22,"Yeah, I put the cod on him."
00:30:22,00:30:23,Yeah.
00:30:23,00:30:24,And it's Tom Scaly.
00:30:24,00:30:25,"He dives though,"
00:30:25,00:30:26,which would presumably be a nightmare
00:30:26,00:30:27,if he was plunging downwards
00:30:27,00:30:29,and then just like hit the bottom
00:30:29,00:30:30,at torpedo speed.
00:30:30,00:30:31,Yeah.
00:30:31,00:30:32,No suits for Tom Scaly.
00:30:32,00:30:33,Yeah.
00:30:33,00:30:34,Anyway.
00:30:34,00:30:35,Some uses of a cod.
00:30:35,00:30:36,"Oh, yeah."
00:30:36,00:30:37,Yeah.
00:30:37,00:30:40,"So if you are a professional fisher person,"
00:30:40,00:30:42,"and when I say professional,"
00:30:42,00:30:44,I mean you're doing it in competitions.
00:30:44,00:30:46,So you've seen who can catch the biggest fish.
00:30:46,00:30:47,Yeah.
00:30:47,00:30:49,The way that they tell which fish is the best
00:30:49,00:30:50,is they weigh it.
00:30:50,00:30:53,"Now, some people will put some like metal"
00:30:53,00:30:56,or something inside the fish to weigh it down.
00:30:56,00:30:59,"Now, what if you bought some cod on the way"
00:30:59,00:31:02,"and you've shoved it inside your fish,"
00:31:02,00:31:03,they'll never find it
00:31:03,00:31:05,because it's fish inside fish.
00:31:05,00:31:06,Amazing.
00:31:06,00:31:07,And that's what happens.
00:31:07,00:31:09,There's this big scandal in fishing
00:31:09,00:31:11,which people have been buying fillets of cod
00:31:11,00:31:13,and shoving them inside the fishes
00:31:13,00:31:14,to make them heavier.
00:31:14,00:31:15,That's disgusting.
00:31:15,00:31:17,That's so disgusting.
00:31:17,00:31:18,It's true.
00:31:18,00:31:21,And there was a notorious case really recently last year
00:31:21,00:31:24,which was uncovered by a judge called Jason Fisher.
00:31:24,00:31:26,"Oh, wow."
00:31:26,00:31:29,How desperate do you have to be to win an angling competition
00:31:29,00:31:32,that you're busy shoving cod up another fish's arse?
00:31:32,00:31:33,What is the...
00:31:33,00:31:35,You must have a look at your life then
00:31:35,00:31:37,"and think, ""I've lost my priorities."""
00:31:37,00:31:40,I'd go down the mouth.
00:31:40,00:31:41,Would you?
00:31:41,00:31:43,"I probably would, yeah,"
00:31:43,00:31:45,as opposed to the small opening.
00:31:45,00:31:48,Which is more plausible.
00:31:48,00:31:51,"Which is more fun, you know?"
00:31:51,00:31:54,You've got to get some fun out of it.
00:31:54,00:31:56,"God, that's really clever, yeah?"
00:31:56,00:31:58,"It's good, isn't it? It's really clever."
00:31:58,00:32:00,"By the way, how many of us on this stage"
00:32:00,00:32:01,have been to Iceland?
00:32:01,00:32:02,I haven't. I know you haven't.
00:32:02,00:32:03,I've been a few times.
00:32:03,00:32:04,"Yeah, you went."
00:32:04,00:32:06,"You did a TV thing, though, didn't you?"
00:32:06,00:32:07,What was it?
00:32:07,00:32:08,Dangerous roads.
00:32:08,00:32:10,And it is good to go to Iceland
00:32:10,00:32:11,when someone else is paying for it
00:32:11,00:32:12,because it's so expensive.
00:32:12,00:32:13,Is it really?
00:32:13,00:32:14,It's so expensive.
00:32:14,00:32:15,"I was like, ""This is really good."
00:32:15,00:32:17,"I'll have another sandwich."""
00:32:17,00:32:19,What did you see?
00:32:19,00:32:22,"Oh, yeah, I suppose it wasn't about the sandwiches."
00:32:22,00:32:25,I saw Ed Gamble.
00:32:25,00:32:27,Do you know a fact about Iceland?
00:32:27,00:32:28,Everyone's...
00:32:28,00:32:29,Loads of people are called Daddy.
00:32:29,00:32:31,So it was my heaven.
00:32:31,00:32:33,Because that's the name of Dave.
00:32:33,00:32:34,That's Dave.
00:32:34,00:32:35,They're called...
00:32:35,00:32:36,"If your name's Dave in England,"
00:32:36,00:32:38,you'd be called Daddy in Iceland.
00:32:38,00:32:39,Chaz and Daddy.
00:32:39,00:32:40,Yeah.
00:32:40,00:32:42,So our fixer was called Daddy.
00:32:42,00:32:44,"And he keeps saying, ""Daddy, Daddy."""
00:32:44,00:32:45,Good fun.
00:32:45,00:32:47,"So in Iceland, you're like..."
00:32:47,00:32:49,"Oh, my God, the winner from Taskmaster."
00:32:49,00:32:50,"From Daddy, Channel Daddy."
00:32:50,00:32:51,"Yeah, Channel Daddy."
00:32:51,00:32:52,"Yeah, Channel Daddy."
00:32:52,00:32:53,It was on Channel Daddy.
00:32:53,00:32:54,Wow.
00:32:54,00:32:55,Dave.
00:32:55,00:32:56,"Oh, I've just understood that."
00:32:56,00:32:57,Sorry.
00:32:57,00:32:59,"I was thinking it was on Channel 4, isn't it?"
00:32:59,00:33:00,"No, got it."
00:33:00,00:33:01,"Oh, sorry."
00:33:01,00:33:02,"No, it did get 4 by 0."
00:33:02,00:33:04,But series 8 when you were on.
00:33:04,00:33:06,Which is there more of in Iceland?
00:33:06,00:33:08,Rabbits or Rabbis?
00:33:08,00:33:10,"Oh, that's good."
00:33:10,00:33:11,Rabbis.
00:33:11,00:33:12,You're saying Rabbis?
00:33:12,00:33:13,I think so.
00:33:13,00:33:15,"Audience have pitched in with a vote for Rabbis, OK?"
00:33:15,00:33:16,"Well, Rabbits."
00:33:16,00:33:17,"Rabbits, thank you."
00:33:17,00:33:19,"Yeah, I would say probably a lot of countries"
00:33:19,00:33:21,"don't have any Rabbits, so I'll say Rabbis."
00:33:21,00:33:23,"One Rabbi, no Rabbits."
00:33:23,00:33:24,You're half right.
00:33:24,00:33:26,They've got loads of Rabbits and only one Rabbi.
00:33:26,00:33:27,I know.
00:33:27,00:33:30,I know a really good fact about Iceland.
00:33:30,00:33:32,Here we go.
00:33:32,00:33:34,"They've got a dating app,"
00:33:34,00:33:36,"because because it's such a small country,"
00:33:36,00:33:38,everyone's sort of related.
00:33:38,00:33:40,"So you could sleep with someone in the pub,"
00:33:40,00:33:42,and it could be your first cousin.
00:33:42,00:33:43,"Oh, my God."
00:33:43,00:33:45,"And so they've got a dating app,"
00:33:45,00:33:46,which this is true.
00:33:46,00:33:48,I don't know why everyone's looking at me like this.
00:33:48,00:33:51,And they've got a dating app where you can tell
00:33:51,00:33:54,how far removed the person you've just got off with is.
00:33:54,00:33:55,"Wait, wait, wait."
00:33:55,00:33:56,Don't you do it before?
00:33:56,00:33:57,"Yeah, maybe do it before."
00:33:57,00:33:58,Maybe do it before.
00:33:58,00:33:59,There's no way they're going to turn the lights on
00:33:59,00:34:01,"and you're like, ""Daddy!"""
00:34:06,00:34:07,So they don't know...
00:34:07,00:34:09,"Like, you don't know all your cousins or whatever,"
00:34:09,00:34:11,"but because so many people are related,"
00:34:11,00:34:14,"and it's caused problems with babies coming out,"
00:34:14,00:34:16,"odd and stuff,"
00:34:16,00:34:19,that someone developed this dating app so you can tell.
00:34:19,00:34:20,"Wow, that's amazing."
00:34:20,00:34:22,"But imagine if you're in the Throws of Passion,"
00:34:22,00:34:24,"and you're like, ""Oh, God, I've just turned the app, maybe."""
00:34:24,00:34:26,"""Oh, no, maybe I won't bother."""
00:34:26,00:34:32,Iceland is home to the hottest hole on the planet.
00:34:32,00:34:34,The hottest hole.
00:34:34,00:34:35,Literally the hottest hole.
00:34:35,00:34:36,Okay.
00:34:36,00:34:39,"So Geothermal Hole is the Iceland Deep Drilling Project,"
00:34:39,00:34:42,"and it's 5,000 degrees Celsius at the bottom."
00:34:42,00:34:43,It's really hot.
00:34:43,00:34:44,I think that's been there.
00:34:44,00:34:45,You've been there.
00:34:45,00:34:46,I think I have.
00:34:46,00:34:47,I think so.
00:34:47,00:34:48,And then there's a big factory on top of it
00:34:48,00:34:49,where you can go and visit.
00:34:49,00:34:50,That's very cool.
00:34:50,00:34:51,I think so.
00:34:51,00:34:52,Yeah.
00:34:52,00:34:53,"Basically, the pressure is too high."
00:34:53,00:34:54,"You put water down there,"
00:34:54,00:34:56,"and it becomes something called Supercritical,"
00:34:56,00:34:58,"which I do not fully understand,"
00:34:58,00:35:00,but it's basically neither liquid nor gas.
00:35:00,00:35:02,I don't know what it is.
00:35:02,00:35:03,Solid?
00:35:03,00:35:04,Yeah.
00:35:04,00:35:07,It's ice.
00:35:07,00:35:10,"If you heat water up enough, it becomes ice again."
00:35:10,00:35:12,Very new science.
00:35:12,00:35:13,Yeah.
00:35:13,00:35:16,It's so useful because they use it to heat everything.
00:35:16,00:35:19,They can have underpavement heating from the geothermal heat.
00:35:19,00:35:21,"So people don't fall over on the ice,"
00:35:21,00:35:22,"because obviously it gets really icy,"
00:35:22,00:35:24,"but you don't slip over and fall, so it's very hard."
00:35:24,00:35:26,"But they use it for so much, don't they?"
00:35:26,00:35:31,Like most of the houses that the hot water comes literally
00:35:31,00:35:33,from the core of our earth.
00:35:33,00:35:35,It's heated by geothermal heat.
00:35:35,00:35:37,Hot water literally from the core of our earth.
00:35:37,00:35:39,"We can edit out the literally from our weather,"
00:35:39,00:35:42,but it's like they got round problems.
00:35:42,00:35:44,But what about that dating app?
00:35:44,00:35:49,Have we ever spoken about the day
00:35:49,00:35:51,that all the women went on strike in Iceland?
00:35:51,00:35:52,I think so.
00:35:52,00:35:53,We have.
00:35:53,00:35:54,1975.
00:35:54,00:35:56,"Basically, there was a thing."
00:35:56,00:35:59,"The United Nations proclaimed it women's year,"
00:35:59,00:36:03,"and basically the women of Iceland got together,"
00:36:03,00:36:06,this group of women as a sort of representative
00:36:06,00:36:08,"and went, we should go on strike"
00:36:08,00:36:10,and make a point about the fact that we're paid less.
00:36:10,00:36:11,We should make a point about
00:36:11,00:36:13,we're doing all the domestic stuff at home.
00:36:13,00:36:14,We're doing all this stuff.
00:36:14,00:36:16,Let's really let them know that this is
00:36:16,00:36:18,something that we disagree with.
00:36:18,00:36:20,"And Iceland back then, in 1975,"
00:36:20,00:36:23,"there's 200,000 people that live in Iceland."
00:36:23,00:36:26,"25,000 women were at one single event"
00:36:26,00:36:28,to hear the speeches that were in the lead up to this.
00:36:28,00:36:32,"And so instead of calling a strike,"
00:36:32,00:36:34,they thought we might piss off too many people
00:36:34,00:36:35,and it won't happen.
00:36:35,00:36:37,"So they said, could we have a day off?"
00:36:37,00:36:39,"And they went, oh, a day off sounds nice."
00:36:39,00:36:40,"Yeah, have a day off."
00:36:40,00:36:43,"So every woman in Iceland had a day off,"
00:36:43,00:36:45,and the country went into chaos.
00:36:45,00:36:47,Supermarkets sold out of sausages
00:36:47,00:36:50,because dads didn't know what to cook their kids.
00:36:50,00:36:53,Everyone was working jobs that they didn't necessarily
00:36:53,00:36:55,knew how to do because they thought they were at a higher level
00:36:55,00:36:57,and they were suddenly having to be the teller at a bank
00:36:57,00:37:00,rather than the bank manager at a bank kind of thing.
00:37:00,00:37:03,The men refer to it still the Long Friday
00:37:03,00:37:07,because it was such a nightmare.
00:37:07,00:37:10,"Hey, I need to move us on to our final fact of the show."
00:37:10,00:37:11,Can I tell you one last thing?
00:37:11,00:37:12,"Yeah, of course."
00:37:12,00:37:14,This is something that happened to an American visitor to Iceland
00:37:14,00:37:15,in 2016.
00:37:15,00:37:17,He was called Noel Santillan.
00:37:17,00:37:19,"He was on holiday and he arrived,"
00:37:19,00:37:20,hired his car.
00:37:20,00:37:23,He wanted to go to Laugavegur Street.
00:37:23,00:37:24,I'm sure I'm pronouncing that wrong.
00:37:24,00:37:26,"45 minutes from the airport, thought no problem."
00:37:26,00:37:28,He misspelled it by one letter
00:37:28,00:37:31,"and Iceland sent him six hours,"
00:37:31,00:37:35,265 miles away to a tiny fishing village.
00:37:35,00:37:37,So he got there.
00:37:37,00:37:38,Bloody hell.
00:37:38,00:37:40,"But the people were very friendly and they were like,"
00:37:40,00:37:42,"""Oh, what a funny mistake to make."""
00:37:42,00:37:44,"""Oh, well, he stayed there for a few days like making friends."""
00:37:44,00:37:45,"""Oh, it's the funny American."""
00:37:45,00:37:48,"On the way back, he was trying to get to the Blue Lagoon geothermal spa."
00:37:48,00:37:50,It happened again.
00:37:50,00:37:52,"He ended up in the coastal town,"
00:37:52,00:37:54,which is home to the office of the company which owns the spa.
00:37:54,00:37:56,So he just ended up in an office building.
00:37:56,00:38:00,"Literally, he walked into a staff meeting rather than anything."
00:38:00,00:38:03,"And they said, ""Ah, you must be the American."""
00:38:03,00:38:14,"I need to move us on to our final fact of the show,"
00:38:14,00:38:16,and that is James.
00:38:16,00:38:18,"OK, my fact this week is that there is an app"
00:38:18,00:38:21,that can tell you when your fly is down.
00:38:21,00:38:22,Yeah.
00:38:22,00:38:24,"It's just useful, isn't it?"
00:38:24,00:38:25,Right.
00:38:25,00:38:27,"It's the work of a guy called Guy Dupont,"
00:38:27,00:38:30,who is a YouTuber and a hacker.
00:38:30,00:38:32,And he's invented loads of things.
00:38:32,00:38:34,"He's invented, like, a baby monitor,"
00:38:34,00:38:39,which vibrates when the baby cries so it's more accessible.
00:38:39,00:38:43,He hacks his fridge so it tells him when he accidentally leaves it open.
00:38:43,00:38:46,"But this is, by far, his most useful invention."
00:38:46,00:38:48,It's a pair of smart pants.
00:38:48,00:38:53,"And whenever your fly has been down for, let's say, 30 seconds"
00:38:53,00:38:55,"or maybe a bit longer, maybe a minute or two,"
00:38:55,00:38:58,then you'll get a beep on your phone saying your fly is low.
00:38:58,00:39:00,You need to look at it now.
00:39:00,00:39:01,"Is it called the ""WiFly""?"
00:39:01,00:39:03,"It's called the ""WiFly""."
00:39:03,00:39:04,"Oh, beautiful."
00:39:04,00:39:05,It's really good.
00:39:05,00:39:06,I read an article about James.
00:39:06,00:39:09,It did sound like there were a couple of disadvantages.
00:39:09,00:39:12,"I like to gawk around with my fly is undone, for example."
00:39:15,00:39:19,"It's constantly monitoring, so your phone battery lasts about half an hour while you're using it."
00:39:19,00:39:21,"Also, you can't watch the jeans anymore"
00:39:21,00:39:23,because there are powerful magnets inside the zip.
00:39:23,00:39:25,But it's teething troubles.
00:39:25,00:39:27,"Yeah, I'm trying those out."
00:39:27,00:39:30,What's the problem with your fly is that it's not that big a thing that you'd...
00:39:30,00:39:33,"Would you ever get an app just to... I mean, who cares?"
00:39:33,00:39:35,"Someone will tell you, right?"
00:39:35,00:39:36,I guess so.
00:39:36,00:39:38,Maybe someone will go sort that out.
00:39:38,00:39:40,If you're somewhere quite...
00:39:40,00:39:42,"If you're somewhere quite, like, urban, though, often people don't tell you"
00:39:42,00:39:45,because people talk to you like you're strangers.
00:39:45,00:39:48,"Yeah, if you're a primary school teacher, that's a problem."
00:39:48,00:39:49,Yeah.
00:39:49,00:39:51,But just day-to-day.
00:39:51,00:39:52,"Yeah, I don't know."
00:39:52,00:39:53,I do see that.
00:39:53,00:39:57,"But yeah, like you say, because you can't wash it, that's going to be a problem."
00:39:57,00:40:01,And it reminds me of they did make some robotic trousers for old people.
00:40:01,00:40:02,Do you remember this?
00:40:02,00:40:03,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:40:03,00:40:04,And they were really good.
00:40:04,00:40:07,"Obviously, they wanted to stop old people from falling over,"
00:40:07,00:40:11,so they made this kind of exoskeleton which would help them to walk.
00:40:11,00:40:13,"And it was absolutely brilliant, it worked really well,"
00:40:13,00:40:15,but the problem was that you couldn't wash them
00:40:15,00:40:18,"and they couldn't stop the old people from trying to wash them,"
00:40:18,00:40:20,no matter what they said to them.
00:40:20,00:40:22,They just kept putting them in the washing machine.
00:40:22,00:40:25,They're often shitting themselves.
00:40:25,00:40:27,We're really living in a sort of golden...
00:40:27,00:40:31,"unrecognized, I would say, golden age of innovation in the app world."
00:40:31,00:40:35,So one that I found is Airbnb.
00:40:35,00:40:40,"So like Airbnb, but Airbnb is for people who hate public toilets"
00:40:40,00:40:44,and there are people in the local area who've put their apartment
00:40:44,00:40:46,listed just as the toilets.
00:40:46,00:40:47,No.
00:40:47,00:40:49,So you can go and you can just...
00:40:49,00:40:52,"It's like me being at home and someone knocking on the door and go,"
00:40:52,00:40:54,"""Oh, we got an Airbnb appointment."""
00:40:54,00:40:57,And they come in and take a piss in my toilet and then head off.
00:40:57,00:40:58,No.
00:40:58,00:40:59,And we give each other a review.
00:40:59,00:41:01,What's the review?
00:41:01,00:41:04,I think that is run by perverts.
00:41:04,00:41:05,It's got to be.
00:41:05,00:41:08,"As a woman, there's no way you go to a stranger's house to use the toilet."
00:41:08,00:41:09,I don't think so.
00:41:09,00:41:10,"No, good point."
00:41:10,00:41:14,Not even if they were like 4.9 stars.
00:41:14,00:41:16,Have you never killed anyone?
00:41:16,00:41:18,"Oh, boffin."
00:41:18,00:41:20,"Yeah, no, there's a really good point."
00:41:20,00:41:24,I think it's more the ideas that I find interesting than the practicality of it.
00:41:24,00:41:25,Yeah.
00:41:25,00:41:27,Have you put your home on Airbnb?
00:41:27,00:41:30,"No, not yet, but it was my..."
00:41:30,00:41:35,Because it was my dream.
00:41:35,00:41:37,"Well, I was in a bit of London once."
00:41:37,00:41:39,It was near a park and there were no toilets around.
00:41:39,00:41:40,"And I thought, ""You know, I should do it."
00:41:40,00:41:44,I should just open up a toilet and I'll sit in there.
00:41:44,00:41:49,Like I'm Ted Dancing in Cheers and people come in and they'll have a pee and we'll chat
00:41:49,00:41:50,and then they'll go out.
00:41:50,00:41:54,"I'll charge them, I don't know, 20 quid of piss and stuff like that."""
00:41:54,00:41:56,"Well, they're getting a good chat, aren't they?"
00:41:56,00:41:57,"Yeah, exactly."
00:41:57,00:42:01,Who would pay 20 quid to have a brief chat with you and then a piss?
00:42:01,00:42:02,Yep.
00:42:02,00:42:04,"I mean, you've invented the public toilet there."
00:42:04,00:42:05,I don't think you know.
00:42:05,00:42:06,"No, no, no."
00:42:06,00:42:08,"Because that's dirty and disgusting, the public toilet."
00:42:08,00:42:10,And there might be people in there who are naughty.
00:42:10,00:42:11,And so this is...
00:42:11,00:42:13,What's the point at me when you say that?
00:42:13,00:42:15,I was referring back to your point.
00:42:15,00:42:16,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:42:16,00:42:19,So this would be guaranteed a high-class...
00:42:19,00:42:21,No one ever opens a public toilet.
00:42:21,00:42:22,No one ever...
00:42:22,00:42:23,Exactly.
00:42:23,00:42:26,"Nobody ever opens a public toilet saying, ""Well, in two weeks this is going to be a disgraceful"
00:42:26,00:42:27,to be a disgraceful...
00:42:27,00:42:28,"No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,"
00:42:28,00:42:29,"no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,"
00:42:29,00:42:30,"no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,"
00:42:30,00:42:31,"no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,"
00:42:31,00:42:31,"no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no"
00:42:31,00:42:54,"No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,"
00:42:54,00:43:12,"no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,"
00:43:12,00:43:19,"random calls with strangers. So if I go to a public toilet, might someone chat to me while I'm there?"
00:43:19,00:43:26,"I'm just thinking. On Wanky? On Wanky, yeah. That's Wanky, I think. That's a very different app."
00:43:26,00:43:32,There's a few other apps which I think are really cool. So there's an app that can blow out candles.
00:43:32,00:43:39,"What? Yeah, isn't that really cool? So it's called the Blower app and it's a... You must have been"
00:43:39,00:43:44,disappointed when you downloaded that. Your mum designed it.
00:43:44,00:43:53,"It's basically, it's an extraordinary kind of innovation where certain frequencies are"
00:43:53,00:43:58,generated by the app. That means that the phone itself shakes in such a way and where there are
00:43:58,00:44:05,"the holes for the speakers, it turns the air that's inside into being propelled out strong enough"
00:44:05,00:44:10,"that it can blow out a candle. Wow. So you can use it, yeah. But why can't you just blow out your"
00:44:10,00:44:20,"own candles? Well, it's... That's not the spirit that, you know, conquered the American frontier,"
00:44:20,00:44:25,"is it? Let's do things the way we've done them in the past. No, let's make the phone app do it."
00:44:25,00:44:30,Let's make the phone app conquer the American frontier for us. We did say in the past that when
00:44:30,00:44:34,"you blow out candles on a cake, it puts loads of germs all over the cake. So it's a bad thing to do."
00:44:34,00:44:40,"You don't think that's covered in germs? Well, I did read there was a study of 3,500"
00:44:40,00:44:46,"swabs taken from people's phones and they found nine unstudied branches of bacterial life,"
00:44:46,00:44:53,including many species of bacteria that were unknown to science. Wow. They found one species
00:44:53,00:44:58,of Edwards bacteria that had only previously been known in an underground water aquifer
00:44:58,00:45:04,and another one that was only found previously in abandoned gold mines. Wow. And they're just on
00:45:04,00:45:09,"your phone. That's amazing, isn't it? Like, that's quite nice in a way. I feel like I'm harboring"
00:45:09,00:45:15,"interesting things. Oh, yeah. We all feel that. I know what you mean. It is kind of nice in a way,"
00:45:15,00:45:22,"but we don't know whether how safe it is, I suppose. Do you know the word fly? For your zip?"
00:45:22,00:45:27,"Or for anything? Yeah, fly. Do you know what the word fly originally meant? Did it mean a zip? Did it"
00:45:27,00:45:33,"mean the insect or did it mean to fly around somewhere? Oh, looking cool. Oh, looking cool."
00:45:33,00:45:38,"There's four options. Which one do you think came first? I'd guess to fly. To fly as in the verb,"
00:45:38,00:45:44,"yeah. Well, weirdly enough, it was the insect that came first and then it came to mean like flapping"
00:45:44,00:45:51,your wings or flapping things and then it came to mean flying as in the verb to fly. And the reason
00:45:51,00:45:57,"that you have a fly on your trousers, the fly is not the zipper. It's the bit that covers the zipper"
00:45:57,00:46:02,and that's because it kind of flaps in the wind like the front of a tent. So where you have the
00:46:02,00:46:06,"zipper of a tent, you have a little bit of cloth and that flaps in the wind. Oh, yeah. And that was"
00:46:06,00:46:11,named a fly because it flaps and then the front of your trousers was named a fly because it looks
00:46:11,00:46:17,"like the front of a tent. So tents came before trousers? Before flies were named, yeah. Well,"
00:46:17,00:46:23,"that in itself is a very exciting fact. Do you not think? Oh, yeah, I'm aroused."
00:46:23,00:46:30,"I found a couple of new apps that are launched, one new app that's launched this summer, which is"
00:46:30,00:46:35,quite exciting. I've actually got it on my phone now so I can answer questions about it. It's called
00:46:35,00:46:44,"Text with Jesus. Oh, lovely. And it's recreated our Lord as a chat GPT guy and you can write,"
00:46:44,00:46:49,"you can ask questions and he'll answer you. And you get lots of people. You get Jesus, Moses,"
00:46:49,00:46:57,"the Virgin Mary, Abraham's nephew, Lot. Was he the one who got turned into a pillar of salt?"
00:46:57,00:47:00,"That was Lot's wife, I think. Oh, is it? But you can ask Lot what was it like when your wife was"
00:47:00,00:47:05,turned into a pillar of salt. And basically they write back quite convincing answers. They're
00:47:05,00:47:10,"quite realistic. Got any examples? Hang on, I have to dig out, sorry, because I have been chatting to"
00:47:10,00:47:17,them. Mary Magdalene cost $2.99 a month because various people are locked on the thing so you
00:47:17,00:47:22,can't access. How much is Jesus? Jesus is free. Jesus is part of the package. That's good message.
00:47:22,00:47:27,"Jesus is free. Of the Apostles, only Peter is free and everyone else is locked."
00:47:27,00:47:33,"John the Baptist, Abraham. Judas on there. Judas Iscariot is on there. How much?"
00:47:35,00:47:42,He's 30 pieces of silver. I don't get so much Judas material these days.
00:47:42,00:47:52,"I chatted a bit up to Job. Oh, God, is he having a tough time, I guess? He is when he's chatting to me."
00:47:52,00:47:56,That legendary patience is wearing very thin.
00:48:02,00:48:08,"He's finally given up on God now, hasn't he? Also, when you look at the messages, he's written"
00:48:08,00:48:14,quite a lot. That's a joke. That's a joke. That's a joke. Job's is a single line answer and he's like
00:48:14,00:48:23,"ten lines per message. My opening gambit with Job was, ""What joke should I get? Ha, ha, ha."
00:48:23,00:48:28,"Sunglasses emoji."" Job replied, ""Ha, ha. I see what you did there."" Well,"
00:48:29,00:48:34,"I said to some detail, we're playing. Hang on, who is, is that all the long message,"
00:48:34,00:48:38,"is that Joe? The long message was, ""I'm not writing an essay to Joe."""
00:48:38,00:48:43,"What does Job think of the podcast? Can you ask? I can ask, yeah."
00:48:43,00:48:47,"Yeah, do that live and let's find out. Also, can you ask Job why he's so clingy?"
00:48:47,00:48:54,"As an ancient figure, I must admit that I'm not familiar with modern podcasts like no such thing"
00:48:54,00:49:05,"as a fish. Oh, muttered. That's going on the poster. It's no, ""My dad wrote a porno,"" of course."
00:49:05,00:49:10,"Is that why he's put ""seriously?"" No, it's not why he's put ""seriously."""
00:49:10,00:49:15,"He says, ""From what I gather, this is what it is,"" and they discuss interesting and unusual facts."
00:49:15,00:49:19,"Podcasts like these can be great for expanding your knowledge, discovering fascinating tidbits,"
00:49:19,00:49:23,"and even sparking curiosity. If you enjoy learning new things, don't laugh sarcastically at that."
00:49:23,00:49:28,"If you enjoy learning new things in an entertaining way, it sounds like no such"
00:49:28,00:49:32,"thing as a fish could be right up your alley. Nice. Of course, everyone's taste is stiffer."
00:49:32,00:49:45,"Okay, that's it. That is all of our facts. Thank you so much for listening. If you'd like to get in"
00:49:45,00:49:48,"contact with any of us about the things that we've said over the course of this podcast,"
00:49:48,00:49:52,"we can be found on our Twitter accounts. I'm on @Sriberland, James--"

00:49:56,00:49:58,What do you mean?
00:49:58,00:50:03,"Well, I don't know what my Twitter name is. But also, you looked at me like that was incorrect,"
00:50:03,00:50:04,and I trust you more than me.
00:50:04,00:50:12,"That alone, myself, was doing."
00:50:12,00:50:17,"Or you can go to our group account, which is @NoSuchThing, or our website."
00:50:17,00:50:23,"NoSuchThing is a fish.com. All of our previous episodes are there, so do check them out. Of course,"
00:50:23,00:50:27,"definitely, definitely pick up Lou's amazing new book, What's That Lady Doing?"
