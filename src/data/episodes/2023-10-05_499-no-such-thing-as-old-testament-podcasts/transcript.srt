00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,640
 Hi everyone and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish where we were joined

2
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:11,920
 by none other than Lou Sanders, one of the funniest people I know.

3
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:14,400
 You'll know Lou from all sorts of TV stuff.

4
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:20,080
 She was on Taskmaster, she's been on QI many times, she's just a really, really, really

5
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:21,080
 funny person.

6
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:25,160
 We had such a good laugh with her making this show in the Soho Theatre last month, but what

7
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:30,520
 I really want to say and what is very important is that Lou has a brand new book out.

8
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:33,720
 The book is called What That Lady Doing.

9
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:39,240
 It's a really, really great book about how she maybe used to be a little bit unhinged

10
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:43,720
 and now channels all that unhingedness into amazing comedy.

11
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:47,160
 It's so well written, I really highly recommend it.

12
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:53,320
 But one thing I should also say while we're talking about books is that Anna and I have

13
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:58,440
 written our own book, it's called Everything to Play For, the QI book of sport.

14
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:02,560
 It's for people who like sports, it's even for people who don't like sports, who just

15
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:05,840
 want to read a load of interesting stories and fun facts.

16
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,760
 I mean, it's from me and Anna, you know what you're going to get.

17
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:13,560
 And it comes out next Thursday, but the reason we wanted to mention it now is because if you

18
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:22,160
 go to Waterstones and you put in the offer code QISport23, then you will get 25% off

19
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:26,800
 and that is a deal for pre-order only, so you need to do that before Thursday if you

20
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:29,920
 want to get our book for a quarter off.

21
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:34,760
 Anyway, more importantly really for this week is you must go and check out Lou Sanders book

22
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:40,440
 What That Lady Doing, that's available right now in all bookshops and all online places

23
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:56,480
 where you get your books, hope you enjoy the show on with a podcast.

24
00:01:56,480 --> 00:02:01,720
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast this

25
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:12,920
 week coming to you live from the Soho Theater in London.

26
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:17,640
 My name is Dan Schreiber and I'm sitting here with James Harkin, Andrew Hunter Murray

27
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:22,520
 and Lou Sanders and once again we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite

28
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:27,960
 facts from the last seven days and in no particular order, here we go.

29
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:33,280
 Starting with fact number one and that is my fact, my fact this week is that names of

30
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:42,680
 registered competitive roller derby players include Skatebush, Venus Thytrap, Camille

31
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:49,880
 Toe, Alice in Wunderland and Weird Al Spankabitch.

32
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:59,200
 Very rude but this is the most fun naming convention I think I've ever discovered which

33
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:03,360
 is the amazing sport of roller derby largely takes place in America.

34
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:08,600
 They have this huge registry of names where when you join you almost get like a WWF wrestling

35
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:13,400
 name, you pick it for yourself, you put it forward and you get added to this big register

36
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:18,800
 and then when you're out there that's who you are, that's who you embody and there's

37
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:22,560
 something like 40,000 names that have been put over various different lists over the

38
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,560
 years.

39
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:29,320
 They're so good, the names are so good, it's a huge list and you can waste a lot of time

40
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:31,360
 as I did.

41
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:38,480
 So HP Shovecraft, Roldemort, that's a good one and some of them are just like pure on,

42
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:47,000
 like there are some just violent ones, Affirmative Smaction, Agatha Crushty, Al Strapone, a bit

43
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
 of a stretch.

44
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,760
 I think they're going for that, are they?

45
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:55,920
 I think it's Al Capone but with the Strapon, there's also Adolf Glitter, Adolf Hitter,

46
00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:02,320
 Adolf Whistler and Adolf Hitter, I'm sure I think flirting with the taste line, but

47
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:03,320
 they are good.

48
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:04,320
 And winning.

49
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:09,560
 It's an amazing spot, it's mostly women who do it, in fact it's almost exclusively women.

50
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:10,560
 Fine.

51
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:14,440
 Well you do it, you're not roller derby but you're a roller skater.

52
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:17,680
 Yeah, I know some roller derby people, yeah.

53
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,680
 And do you have a name?

54
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:26,320
 Oh what do we call it, Loose Ends, Loose Ends, Loose Ends because a skating term is to send

55
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,320
 it.

56
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:28,320
 Loose Ends.

57
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:32,360
 I actually found roller derby names for each of us, it's going through the database.

58
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:41,020
 So for you, Lou, there is Lou Brickendt and Lou's your daddy, Lou's your daddy's lovely.

59
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:44,240
 And there's Andy Clockwise, James Bondage andâ€¦

60
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:47,240
 Do you know what they do in roller derby?

61
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,800
 Did you think it's Bondage?

62
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:53,400
 No, in his fantasies, a little bit different.

63
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,400
 Dan Halen or Dansyn Queen?

64
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:56,400
 Dansyn Queen!

65
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,400
 Oh that's good.

66
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,400
 Yeah, so yeah.

67
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:03,160
 But the spot is basically you roller skate around the rink, right, and you've got one

68
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:09,000
 person who's kind of in charge and who you're trying to protect while the other team are

69
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,480
 trying to get them, basically, it's like that kind of thing, isn't it?

70
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:16,640
 And it started off, the whole spot started off as endurance races.

71
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:20,680
 So in the 1880s, there was this huge thing in America, I think we might have mentioned

72
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:26,520
 it before, of women doing six-day races where they would just walk and walk and walk and

73
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:31,360
 walk again and again and again until basically there was one person left who would just keep

74
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,880
 walking and keep walking.

75
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:37,200
 And then they started to do it on roller skates and what they found is that some of the people

76
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:41,920
 who were faster would get around the circuit and start overtaking people and then the people

77
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:45,760
 who were being overtaken would really hate it and so they start knocking them over.

78
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:46,760
 Right.

79
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:49,960
 And they found that people enjoyed that way more than they enjoyed the rest of it.

80
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:53,800
 They didn't really quite like people just going round in circles loads and loads of times,

81
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:56,160
 but they loved it when people beat the shit out of each other.

82
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,160
 Yeah.

83
00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:02,320
 Well, I can see why though, because the very first one that they did, this is what you

84
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:09,520
 would come and watch, people skating, roller skating around a ring, 57,000 times.

85
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:12,800
 The idea was that they were going across America, that's the thing, they'd worked out how many

86
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,720
 times around the thing was to get from New York to LA or whatever.

87
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,840
 Let's stop for breaks though, right?

88
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:18,840
 Yeah, yeah.

89
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:19,840
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

90
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:20,840
 Not much.

91
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:21,840
 You wouldn't stop for much breaks.

92
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:25,960
 You stop for just like 20 minutes here or there and you go 24 hours just with the occasional

93
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:26,960
 just stopping for the off-map.

94
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:30,840
 I think it's a lot more fun now, they're sort of bashing each other out of the way.

95
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:31,840
 Have you done that?

96
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:32,840
 Have you tried that?

97
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:33,840
 No, but so many people have told me.

98
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:36,920
 So basically it's quite aggressive sport, like my friends do it and it's like you end

99
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:41,760
 up with a lot of breakages and stuff and it's often like big units that do it.

100
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:46,320
 And so many people have told me that would be really good at it.

101
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:49,800
 It's so many, but you should do that.

102
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:52,400
 Do you know what your friends have particular names that...

103
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:57,240
 Yeah, but I can't remember any of them, but I did write, I only write down two, C-unit,

104
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:59,080
 but the I is very small so...

105
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:00,080
 C-unit.

106
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,280
 Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

107
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:08,360
 And Captain Beaver and I thought, sounds like my love life.

108
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:13,280
 I was chatting to someone called Lin Huynh who was England captain.

109
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,880
 Hang on, is that a joke name or that's...?

110
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,280
 It's not, it's real, it's her real name.

111
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:17,280
 What's say the name again?

112
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,280
 Lin Huynh.

113
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:19,280
 Oh, OK, Lin Huynh.

114
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,360
 I did think you said Lin Huynh and that's why I...

115
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,360
 I thought Lin Huynh.

116
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:23,760
 That might have been her fake name.

117
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:27,920
 No, her fake name was Shaolin Scarlett and she was a captain of the England team in the

118
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:30,480
 World Cups in 2014 and 2016.

119
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:33,840
 And I was asking her about how it works, she said, "Lots of teamwork is really, really

120
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,360
 important, the teamwork.

121
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:39,640
 And when they came up with a new tactic, they all get matching tattoos of their tactic

122
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:41,040
 of Lin Huynh.

123
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,040
 That's pretty hard, Clarice.

124
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:44,040
 Well, we do that with our facts, don't we?

125
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:48,880
 Remember, yeah, we are absolutely coated head-to-toe, they've had to make the font smaller and

126
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:52,440
 smaller as the years go by, because they keep thinking we'll stop, but we won't.

127
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:54,680
 Have you got any tattoos?

128
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:56,600
 Uh, have a guess.

129
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:57,600
 No.

130
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,600
 I'll never tell.

131
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:01,840
 I mean, this is a podcast, you can say what you want.

132
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:04,840
 Oh, yeah, I got 16 huge ones, yeah.

133
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:05,840
 Got all the lingo.

134
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:06,840
 No, yeah.

135
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:08,840
 16 big ones.

136
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:12,840
 That's why you walked into the tattoo place and said, "Give me 16 big ones."

137
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:16,840
 I don't mind what they're of, as long as they're big, yeah.

138
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:19,840
 Teenage Mutant Inja Turtle, there's another one.

139
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:20,840
 Oh, very nice.

140
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:23,840
 I thought that was your tattoo.

141
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,840
 Two-pack Shanker.

142
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:26,840
 That's clever.

143
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:27,840
 That's good, yeah.

144
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:28,840
 Twat Rocket.

145
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:29,840
 Don't quite care.

146
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,840
 I don't think that one's so clever.

147
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:34,840
 Sounds a bit of life.

148
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:35,840
 The events as well.

149
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:41,840
 Night of the Rolling Dead, Noctober Fest, Spank's Giving, Season's Beatings.

150
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:42,840
 Okay.

151
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:43,840
 They're great.

152
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:48,840
 But there were these big mass events earlier, like even in the 19th century, before they

153
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:51,840
 started doing proper skating, before these sort of like formal events.

154
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:57,840
 So in 1884, there was a guy called Victor Clough, who skated 100 miles in 10 hours, like

155
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:00,840
 in around a course, which was very impressive.

156
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:05,840
 And then in 1885, there was a six-day event where they had 36 skaters, again, roller skates

157
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:06,840
 competing.

158
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:09,840
 And then soon after that, the winner of the race, who was a guy called William Donovan,

159
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:12,840
 and another competitor, died.

160
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:13,840
 Oh.

161
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:14,840
 Yeah.

162
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:18,840
 And they said, "Oh, maybe we shouldn't do this for 10 hours a day all the time."

163
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:20,840
 Because people just weren't up to it, and they just kept going.

164
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:23,840
 I was reading about the walking version that came before the skating.

165
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:26,840
 And this was, like I said, it was women doing this for six days at a time.

166
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,840
 And it became so popular that there was one stage.

167
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,840
 I can't remember where it was.

168
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:33,840
 But there was a load of kids went missing in an area, and everyone thought, "Oh, shit,

169
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,840
 all these kids are gone missing."

170
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:40,840
 And what they found is, they were in a warehouse, and they started their own events of walking

171
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,840
 around in circles for days on end.

172
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:45,840
 And they just were trying to copy what these women were doing, and were like, "Yeah,

173
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:46,840
 let's do it ourselves."

174
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:49,840
 And they'd been walking around in circles for three days when they were found.

175
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:50,840
 God.

176
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,840
 I thought that was going to take a darker turn.

177
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:56,840
 I thought it was going to be like a roller-skating Pied Piper situation, where the Pied Piper

178
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:59,840
 had skated through the town, and all the children had danced.

179
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,840
 Yeah, we thought it was a Jimmy Sapple.

180
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,840
 I didn't think that.

181
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,840
 Did you hear of Rinkomania?

182
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:06,840
 No, what's that?

183
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:09,840
 This is the Edwardian craze for rinks, skating rinks.

184
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:13,840
 Loads of venues around everywhere used to be rinks that are now converted.

185
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:15,840
 Just because it was so crazy.

186
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,840
 Basically, because you could meet the opposite sex.

187
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:21,840
 That was the, you're a bit less chaperoned, you're able to skate away from your chaperone.

188
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:26,840
 I read one article saying, "Mother Grundy, dare not trust herself on skates."

189
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:29,840
 Which meant that some, you know, all the person isn't going to be watching you,

190
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:31,840
 and making sure what you're doing with the other...

191
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:32,840
 Exactly.

192
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:33,840
 ...the opposite sex, yeah.

193
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:36,840
 My wife started, I can't believe, I just thought of this just now.

194
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:39,840
 My wife decided to start roller-skating.

195
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:42,840
 And her skate instructor's very upset.

196
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:45,840
 What's her street name?

197
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,840
 Ooh, I'm not sure.

198
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:50,840
 I don't want to say anything that will mean I can't go home tonight,

199
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:52,840
 because she's here.

200
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:54,840
 So, but here's the thing, right?

201
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:55,840
 So she bought a pair of roller skates.

202
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,840
 She hasn't done it since she was a teenager.

203
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:00,840
 And we're leaving the house, and she starts putting them on.

204
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:01,840
 And I said, "What are you doing?"

205
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,840
 And she was like, "I'm just going to go and do it now."

206
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:05,840
 And I was like, "You've got to test it out in a park.

207
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:09,840
 We're on a main road here, and you're going on your own with our child in a buggy."

208
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:13,840
 "Wilf was like only a few months, like, you know, nine months old or something like that."

209
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,840
 So I said, "Listen, I'd better come with you."

210
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:16,840
 And she was insistent that she does it.

211
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:19,840
 So she put the roller skates on.

212
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:21,840
 She took the buggy outside.

213
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,840
 And you live at the top of a very steep hill, don't you?

214
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,840
 We do have a bit of an incline on the street.

215
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:28,840
 And you go everywhere by unicycle as well, don't you?

216
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:33,840
 So I closed the door, and all I hear is, "Ahhh!"

217
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:37,840
 And I turn around, and Fenella and the buggy have just gone off.

218
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:40,840
 And she can't stop, because she doesn't know how to use the brake on the back.

219
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:44,840
 And I have to chase them down the road as they're heading to oncoming traffic,

220
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:45,840
 coming on the road.

221
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:48,840
 Oh, yeah, there's two guys with a glass going across the road.

222
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:49,840
 Wow.

223
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:51,840
 I love that spirit, though.

224
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,840
 That is amazing.

225
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,840
 Oh, can I ask you, have you seen Roller Limbo?

226
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:56,840
 No.

227
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,840
 This is amazing.

228
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:01,840
 Okay, so it is literally, as it sounds, it's limbo on roller skates.

229
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:03,840
 Oh, yes, yes.

230
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:05,840
 You think you know what it is, and you're wrong.

231
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,840
 No, no, no.

232
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:12,840
 So what you're imagining, maybe, is someone skating towards and then bending backwards.

233
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:13,840
 That's what I was imagining, yeah.

234
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:14,840
 It's not how you do it.

235
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:18,840
 You basically, it's so hard to describe, because I'm behind a desk,

236
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:22,840
 but basically, your legs go out to the sides, you go down into the splits.

237
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:25,840
 I'll be honest, Andy, I don't think the fact there's a desk here

238
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:28,840
 is what makes that difficult for you to imagine.

239
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:31,840
 I so wish I could show you all.

240
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:34,840
 Well, we have bought some skates for you.

241
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:36,840
 So you're doing the sideways splits.

242
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:38,840
 You do a sideways splits, but you're moving forwards,

243
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:41,840
 and you're holding onto your calves.

244
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:45,840
 I know, and you're going under these bars, which are about, I don't know,

245
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:48,840
 20 centimetres high, and you're so low as you head for it.

246
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:50,840
 You've got to look it up. It is so good.

247
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:51,840
 Wow.

248
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:52,840
 It's the most amazing thing.

249
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:55,840
 Those people need to grow up a little bit.

250
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:58,840
 Well, the competitors are mostly children, so...

251
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:01,840
 No, good on them.

252
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:04,840
 Have you heard of Jean-Yves Blondeau?

253
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:05,840
 No.

254
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:09,840
 So Jean-Yves Blondeau has invented a new suit made of plastic

255
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:12,840
 that has 30 roller skates attached to it

256
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:14,840
 in all different parts of his body.

257
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:18,840
 So wherever he... If he falls over on his back, he can roller skate.

258
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:21,840
 If he falls on his front, he can roller skate.

259
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:22,840
 Brilliant.

260
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:24,840
 If he falls on his head, he can roller skate.

261
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:28,840
 He can walk along the wall and roller skate along the wall as he's going.

262
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:29,840
 I can't make it.

263
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,840
 He can. There's videos on YouTube.

264
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:32,840
 Wow.

265
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:33,840
 It does it.

266
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:36,840
 Is he using it as powers for good or for evil?

267
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:39,840
 I would say neither good nor evil.

268
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:41,840
 He's just using them for more hits on YouTube.

269
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:42,840
 Can he do it on his head?

270
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:43,840
 That's incredible.

271
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:46,840
 Yeah, the head one, I probably may be exaggerating a little bit.

272
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:48,840
 But he could do it in theory, yeah.

273
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:51,840
 And he basically goes down all these really big hills around the world

274
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:53,840
 as quickly as he can on his suit.

275
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:57,840
 How does he stop? Does he have a break on, like, his elbows or something?

276
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,840
 You know what? I'm not sure.

277
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:01,840
 He must have some breaks, yeah.

278
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,840
 He's still going somewhere right now.

279
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:05,840
 Actually, you're going against the butt when they help.

280
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:06,840
 You don't need to stop.

281
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:08,840
 Like, the reason you stop yourself is in case you fall over.

282
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:10,840
 He's already fallen over.

283
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:14,840
 You don't need to stop. There's a big wall there.

284
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:18,840
 You can just go up the wall and then on the side and then on his head and stuff.

285
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:19,840
 It cannot be stopped.

286
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,840
 He should be stopped.

287
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:26,840
 He also has one of his suits, which, these ones you can buy, these 30 ones.

288
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:28,840
 I don't know how much they are, but they are available.

289
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:31,840
 But he does have one suit, which isn't for sale,

290
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:34,840
 but he also features samurai blades and spike horns.

291
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:35,840
 Oh, my God.

292
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:36,840
 What is that useful for?

293
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:38,840
 Probably evil, I reckon.

294
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:42,840
 I give him six years of life expectancy.

295
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:43,840
 Yeah, exactly.

296
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:45,840
 I need to move this on very soon.

297
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:47,840
 I've got a couple of other names that I found.

298
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:48,840
 So here's the thing.

299
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:53,840
 There's a lot of extremely rude names on this registry.

300
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:56,840
 And it's done in a kind of empowering way.

301
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:59,840
 I think it's sort of, you know, it's exciting to have these real badass names.

302
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:02,840
 But, God damn it, they really go for it.

303
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:04,840
 So some of them I discovered.

304
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:06,840
 Bitch Hiker is one.

305
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:07,840
 Okay.

306
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:08,840
 Vagina Might.

307
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:09,840
 Oh, wow.

308
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:11,840
 Is that like Marmite?

309
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:12,840
 Yeah.

310
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,840
 Yeah, you love it or you hate it.

311
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:18,840
 It's some kind of yeast extract, I'm not sure.

312
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:25,840
 Oh, my God.

313
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:28,840
 Well, this isn't what I expected from this podcast.

314
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:29,840
 Yeah.

315
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:38,840
 It is time for fact number two, and that is Lou.

316
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:43,840
 Okay, my fact this week is that the TikTok singer who went viral with The Seashunty

317
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:46,840
 is unable to perform his song on the boats

318
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:49,840
 because he suffers from terrible seasickness.

319
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:52,840
 Yeah, it's typhonic.

320
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:54,840
 That's what that is.

321
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:55,840
 It's sweet as well.

322
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:56,840
 It's lame.

323
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:59,840
 It is sweet, it is sweet actually.

324
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:01,840
 It was an amazing thing, wasn't it?

325
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:06,840
 He basically, it was 2021, he suddenly releases this seashanty called Wellerman

326
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:11,840
 and it went to number one, which is, yeah, it went to number one in the UK charts.

327
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:15,840
 It's a song about a whale trawler and they're looking for a whale.

328
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:17,840
 And this was 2021.

329
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:20,840
 So you would think by now, maybe it's died down a bit,

330
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:22,840
 but I went on to his Spotify listens.

331
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:27,840
 Still, as of today, gets five million listens a month on his Spotify account.

332
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:29,840
 That's the same as Tom Jones.

333
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:30,840
 Wow.

334
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:31,840
 Yeah.

335
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:33,840
 So it's not unusual then.

336
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:39,840
 Don't shake your head at your own, that is really good.

337
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:42,840
 It's not even a seashanty, is it?

338
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:43,840
 No, not really, no.

339
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:45,840
 No, it isn't, none of these are.

340
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:46,840
 Is it River Shanty?

341
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:47,840
 What is it?

342
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,840
 It's just a song.

343
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:54,840
 A seashanty has to be something that you sing when you're working.

344
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:56,840
 So like Drunk and Sailor is like,

345
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:58,840
 "What would you do with a drunk and sailor?

346
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:00,840
 You're pulling the rope and you're bringing them to sail."

347
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:03,840
 But if he's getting a record deal, he's working sort of on that.

348
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:05,840
 That's a really good point.

349
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:06,840
 Yeah.

350
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:07,840
 He got me there.

351
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:08,840
 Checkmate, Harkin.

352
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:13,840
 But that is the cool thing about seashanties, like the old seashanties is that

353
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:18,840
 because on a vessel you only had a very skeleton crew that had to do multiple things,

354
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:22,840
 the song is the beat of allowing you to know how we all work as a group.

355
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:25,840
 So the rhythm of it, the lyrics of it would mean

356
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:29,840
 you have to pull at that moment and pull at this or whatever places and whatever.

357
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,840
 So people often see it done on like Navy ships.

358
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:33,840
 It never really would have happened on Navy ships

359
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,840
 because they had so much crew, you didn't need this multitasking.

360
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:39,840
 They were banned, the UK Navy, they were banned seashanties

361
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:43,840
 because you wouldn't be able to hear commands if you're singing too much.

362
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:45,840
 But you're having a laugh.

363
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:50,840
 So it's like merchant ships, when wailing ships, things like that.

364
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:53,840
 And there were specific songs for different things you were doing on board.

365
00:17:53,840 --> 00:18:01,840
 So there was hauling shanties, running shanties, pump shanties, swabbing shanties, capstan shanties.

366
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:04,840
 Capstan is that thing you turn around in the middle of the ship that pulls the anchor up.

367
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:05,840
 Oh yeah.

368
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:06,840
 And all these had their own songs, really.

369
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:07,840
 That's pretty cool.

370
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:09,840
 But it's been like that song that he sang.

371
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:12,840
 It's not like it's an obscure song that's not been around for ages.

372
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:17,840
 It's one of the better-known sea songs, and you can read a list of places it's appeared.

373
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:22,840
 So it was in 2013, it was on the album Now That's What I Call Sea Shanties, Volume 1.

374
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:24,840
 No, no.

375
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:25,840
 Yeah.

376
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:26,840
 I found that.

377
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:28,840
 Did you find the Volume 2?

378
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:29,840
 Yeah, I did.

379
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:30,840
 No.

380
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:31,840
 Yeah, it's on Spotify.

381
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,840
 Not as many listeners as Tom Jones.

382
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:34,840
 But it's doing okay.

383
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:38,840
 To be fair, it's a great title, and it's not multiple different sea shanty acts.

384
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:44,840
 It's just the one band from Wellington in New Zealand called Wellington Sea Shanties Society.

385
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:46,840
 But there is a whole genre.

386
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:49,840
 And how did they get that name?

387
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:56,840
 There is a whole niche genre of pirate metal, and they sing Wellerman as well, this song.

388
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:59,840
 It's a Scottish band called Ayle Storm and Stormseeker.

389
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:02,840
 They've been known to sing this song, so it's been around.

390
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:05,840
 So how come he gets all the money for it then, just because he made it popular?

391
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:10,840
 Yeah, it's a traditional song, and so traditional songs, I don't think there's any copyright over...

392
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:12,840
 I'm not sure if that's right, I think that's what's right.

393
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:13,840
 Yeah, you're right.

394
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:16,840
 I think you do get royalties, but you have to bury them on a remote island.

395
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:19,840
 That's quite a pain in the arse actually.

396
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,840
 Okay, a little quiz question for you.

397
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:25,840
 When did the last actual proper shanty man, not like modern singers,

398
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:27,840
 when did the last proper shanty man die?

399
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:28,840
 Oh.

400
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:32,840
 Oh, well, I would have thought probably 18th century.

401
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:33,840
 Okay, any advancements?

402
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,840
 1992, 1992.

403
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:36,840
 1992, okay.

404
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:39,840
 Yeah, 1993.

405
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:42,840
 We're just having a laugh.

406
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:45,840
 Well, Lou, you're correct, because he died in 1992.

407
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:48,840
 Thank you.

408
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:51,840
 Are you joking, Lou?

409
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:52,840
 No, I'm not joking.

410
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:59,840
 I was, as you said it, I was like, keep the poker face, keep, like, don't give away shit.

411
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:00,840
 She's got it.

412
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:02,840
 I didn't look at his notes or anything.

413
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:03,840
 Stanley Hougill.

414
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:04,840
 I knew that.

415
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:06,840
 He was born in 1906.

416
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:08,840
 He was at sea in 1922, at the end of '16.

417
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:09,840
 He's got to be.

418
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:10,840
 Yeah.

419
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:13,840
 And then he was the shanty man on the last ever British sailing ship,

420
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:16,840
 which was called the Garth Pool, and that was on its last voyage.

421
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:18,840
 And that ship was wrecked in 1929.

422
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:19,840
 And then he lived his whole life.

423
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:20,840
 He was in the Sakawa War.

424
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:21,840
 He settled down.

425
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,840
 You know, he wrote down all his shanties,

426
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,840
 because it looked like they're all traditional.

427
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:26,840
 There wasn't this proper songbook.

428
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:27,840
 Wow.

429
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:29,840
 And he died in 1992.

430
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:30,840
 Wow.

431
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:31,840
 Yeah.

432
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:34,840
 And you won't like this, but this is not really yours at back.

433
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:36,840
 But I do think I'm a bit psychic.

434
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:40,840
 Were you talking about sitting right next to the person

435
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:42,840
 who absolutely loves hearing that kind of stuff?

436
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:44,840
 Why do you think you're psychic?

437
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:46,840
 You think you pulled that out of Andy's head just now?

438
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:47,840
 Yeah, basically.

439
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:49,840
 And I'm very emotionally intelligent.

440
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:55,840
 But you don't even believe in UFOs, so I'm not going to continue.

441
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,840
 I said that to you in private backstage.

442
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:02,840
 That's true.

443
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:05,840
 He said he doesn't believe in UFOs and he hates women.

444
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:15,840
 Only one of those things is true.

445
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:17,840
 He's a lovely lad.

446
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:19,840
 Oh, dear.

447
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:20,840
 Oh, wow.

448
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:21,840
 Just joking.

449
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:22,840
 Punishment.

450
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:23,840
 Anyone?

451
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,840
 I think that's actually...

452
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:27,840
 I kind of feel like I've had enough.

453
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:30,840
 This is to do with music and the army.

454
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:33,840
 So corporal punishment in the British army

455
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:36,840
 was often meted out by drummers and bands people.

456
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:37,840
 You were the drum.

457
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:38,840
 In a way.

458
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:40,840
 I suppose in a way you were.

459
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:43,840
 The cat of nine tails is the drumsticks.

460
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:44,840
 It was like rhythm.

461
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:46,840
 Well, no, it wasn't so much that.

462
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:47,840
 It was probably...

463
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,840
 There was two possible reasons.

464
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:51,840
 One, that other musicians would play music

465
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:54,840
 and it would drown out the screams of the person being punished.

466
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:55,840
 Punished.

467
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:58,840
 But probably because just the people who were drummers

468
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:01,840
 or in the band, they were not proper sailors.

469
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:04,840
 And so they were like the lowest of the low of the...

470
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:06,840
 As far as, you know, who's the most senior.

471
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:08,840
 And so the idea was if you were a sailor,

472
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:11,840
 you wouldn't want to be meeting out punishment to your...

473
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:13,840
 to your peers.

474
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:15,840
 And so maybe you would get the person at the bottom to do it.

475
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:18,840
 And that apparently is where we get the idea of being drummed out.

476
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:21,840
 So being drummed out of the army is because it was the drummer

477
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,840
 who would do the beating.

478
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:25,840
 So they're actually beating you?

479
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:27,840
 Yeah, with the cat of nine tails, like...

480
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,840
 Oh, I see. OK, OK, OK.

481
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:32,840
 And do you know what a boy's pussy is?

482
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:34,840
 So...

483
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:37,840
 It's a former champion roller derby...

484
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:39,840
 ..winner.

485
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:43,840
 No, just on topic, it was a cat of nine tails,

486
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:45,840
 but for younger recruits.

487
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:48,840
 So if you're a young person who joined the army,

488
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:51,840
 you weren't of age, perhaps, they would have a...

489
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:54,840
 Like, a cat of nine tails would have nine, like, whips on it,

490
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:56,840
 and there would be knots on it,

491
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:59,840
 but yours would only have five, and it'd be made of smooth cod.

492
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,840
 Oh, that's nice, isn't it?

493
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,840
 Wow. Yeah, boy's pussy.

494
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,840
 Crikey.

495
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:08,840
 Have you ever heard the sea shanty come all you tongueers?

496
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:10,840
 No.

497
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:12,840
 Sing it. Just good. I can't sing it.

498
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:14,840
 Is it the same as come all you faithful?

499
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:17,840
 It's about the tongueers with the guys on board ship

500
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:20,840
 who collected stray intestines of whales floating around.

501
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:22,840
 Wow. Yeah.

502
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:25,840
 I think in Wellerman, he says, "We'll get the tonguing done,"

503
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:27,840
 or something like that. Yeah, he does, exactly.

504
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,840
 So that's what that means. That's what that means, yeah.

505
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:31,840
 That's very cool. Not a lovely job.

506
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,840
 I got a fact about whales singing.

507
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:36,840
 Actual whales and whale songs, so I love this.

508
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:39,840
 Okay, whale song spreads like human songs,

509
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:41,840
 so the scientists found there was a...

510
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:44,840
 Basically, there was a hit whale song among humpback whales

511
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:46,840
 in the West Coast of Australia.

512
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:49,840
 It was only found there, but then several months later,

513
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:51,840
 they heard that same song on the East Coast,

514
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:54,840
 and this happens in the Atlantic too,

515
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:57,840
 and basically hit whale songs make their way from West to East.

516
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,840
 So you will get whales in the East,

517
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:01,840
 which are still singing the old songs,

518
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:04,840
 but the whales in the West have a new song by now,

519
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:06,840
 and it gradually spreads across,

520
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:08,840
 and it's always West to East, and we don't know why.

521
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:10,840
 Wow. That is incredible.

522
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:12,840
 Imagine like the radar was singing,

523
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:16,840
 "It's not on you, it's on you!"

524
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:19,840
 He's got to get those photo-fine numbers from somewhere.

525
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:21,840
 This is a cool thing.

526
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:23,840
 There's seasickness we're talking about,

527
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:25,840
 but there's other kinds of sickness that you can get.

528
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:26,840
 Motion sickness.

529
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:28,840
 Seasickness is one of the motion sicknesses, right?

530
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:29,840
 Love sickness.

531
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:31,840
 We don't know who the person loves sickness.

532
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:32,840
 Yeah, yeah, sorry, yeah, go.

533
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:33,840
 What? Is that a thing?

534
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:35,840
 I thought you were wanting us to join in with more kinds of sickness.

535
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:36,840
 Is that a sickness?

536
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:37,840
 Yeah, it was.

537
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:39,840
 Is love sickness not a thing?

538
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:41,840
 This is this lucky guy.

539
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:47,840
 It was a proper thing in the 19th century, wasn't it?

540
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:48,840
 Love sickness.

541
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:52,840
 They thought that it meant if you had like a pallid expression

542
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:55,840
 and like just deep sun-kais and stuff,

543
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:57,840
 that's because you were love sick.

544
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:58,840
 It was supposed to be a thing.

545
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:00,840
 Okay, so with all the sicknesses,

546
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:02,840
 it's probably impossible to ever say

547
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:04,840
 this was the first person who ever had seasickness.

548
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:07,840
 This is the first person who had love sickness, right?

549
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:10,840
 But we do know the person who had the first sickness of one kind.

550
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:12,840
 So I'll give you the name.

551
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:14,840
 He's called German Titov.

552
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:16,840
 What did Titov have the sickness?

553
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:17,840
 Okay, herpes.

554
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:19,840
 Herpes sickness.

555
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:22,840
 Titov presumably space race.

556
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:23,840
 There we go.

557
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:24,840
 What? What?

558
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:25,840
 Space sickness.

559
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:27,840
 First person to ever have space sickness.

560
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:28,840
 How do you know that?

561
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:30,840
 I feel I'm a bit psychic.

562
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:38,840
 It could be all the Russian history I've read,

563
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:40,840
 but I think it's a psychic-sacr-ness.

564
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:44,840
 So Titov, he was...

565
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:47,840
 Libbit.

566
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:49,840
 Wow, I can't read minds yet.

567
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,840
 I know what you're thinking right now.

568
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:55,840
 Yeah, but you're saying that because you've read it,

569
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:56,840
 you're not psychic,

570
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:58,840
 but I've never read a book of my life.

571
00:25:58,840 --> 00:25:59,840
 I'll just play that.

572
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:00,840
 You've written one, yeah.

573
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:01,840
 Yeah, I've written one.

574
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:03,840
 So 1961, August,

575
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:06,840
 German Titov is the, I think, the fourth human,

576
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:08,840
 certainly one of the first batches of human

577
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:10,840
 to go up and orbit the Earth.

578
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:12,840
 And he's the first person who up there gets,

579
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:14,840
 well, space sickness and vomits,

580
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:16,840
 the first-ever human to vomit in space.

581
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:17,840
 Oh, really?

582
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:18,840
 So it's a landmark thing,

583
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:20,840
 and it affects so many people,

584
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:22,840
 so many astronauts who go up there,

585
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:23,840
 and it's for the opposite reason

586
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:25,840
 that you might get C sickness

587
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:27,840
 or any kind of motion sickness on Earth.

588
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:29,840
 You have an opposite effect, right?

589
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:31,840
 I don't know the proper science,

590
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,840
 but to put it in context,

591
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:34,840
 if you were in a car

592
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:35,840
 and you were reading your phone or a book,

593
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:37,840
 you might get motion sickness,

594
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:39,840
 because what you're staring at

595
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:40,840
 is counter to everything else

596
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:41,840
 that is in your normal life.

597
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:42,840
 Like a movement around you,

598
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:43,840
 you're trying to keep that still?

599
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:44,840
 Yeah, exactly.

600
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:46,840
 In space, to get rid of everything moving around

601
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:48,840
 because of the lack of gravity,

602
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:49,840
 you should read a book

603
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:50,840
 and to get yourself--

604
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:52,840
 My book is now available

605
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:53,840
 from all the bookshops.

606
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:54,840
 It's called What's That Lady

607
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:56,840
 Doing Full Starts and Happy Endings.

608
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:58,840
 Cheers.

609
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:00,840
 Yeah, it's a--

610
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:03,840
 And have NASA expressed any interest, Lou?

611
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:06,840
 They've not expressed interest.

612
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:07,840
 So here's the thing.

613
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:09,840
 They were very worried when it happened to him

614
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:11,840
 because he came back down to Earth

615
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:13,840
 and was space sickness

616
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:15,840
 something that's going to carry through on into life?

617
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:16,840
 And then suddenly,

618
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:19,840
 they noticed huge changes in his personality.

619
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:22,840
 He suddenly was sort of like

620
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:24,840
 sleeping around with different women.

621
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:26,840
 He was being really rowdy in bars.

622
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:28,840
 He was like all these different personality traits

623
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:30,840
 and they thought, "God, the space sickness has come down."

624
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:31,840
 So they studied him.

625
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:34,840
 Hang on. Did my dad go up to space?

626
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:40,840
 That's the missing chapter in your book, isn't it?

627
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:41,840
 But here's what they worked out.

628
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:43,840
 It wasn't space sickness.

629
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:45,840
 It's just he was a dickhead.

630
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:52,840
 All right, cool.

631
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:53,840
 We need to move on to our next fact.

632
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:55,840
 It is time for fact number three

633
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:58,840
 and that is Andy.

634
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:00,840
 My fact is that the people of Iceland

635
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:03,840
 can think of a good use for 95% of a cod.

636
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:08,840
 So this is a fact about recycling.

637
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:13,840
 Do we know, can you tell us what part of a cod there is?

638
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:14,840
 Yeah, I was thinking that.

639
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:16,840
 That's stubborn the last few percent.

640
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:19,840
 Basically, the blood in the eyeballs are quite hard to

641
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:22,840
 monetise and make, you know,

642
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:23,840
 you properly use it.

643
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:24,840
 I've always said that.

644
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:26,840
 Blood in the eyeballs are hard to monetise.

645
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:29,840
 We have said that the aqueous humour in the eye

646
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:31,840
 can be drunk in an emergency.

647
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:33,840
 Yes, it's just hard to monetise.

648
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:34,840
 Yeah, it's hard to...

649
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:35,840
 Monetise emergency.

650
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:37,840
 Yeah, and there is a use for the blood as well.

651
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:41,840
 It can be used in sausages or as fish food,

652
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:44,840
 but it's hard to get fish to collect the blood from them.

653
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:46,840
 Anyway, basically, this is from a magazine

654
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:48,840
 called Hakai Magazine, which we've mentioned before.

655
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:49,840
 Anna's favourite.

656
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:50,840
 Anna's favourite magazine.

657
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:51,840
 Anna's favourite magazine.

658
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,840
 It's all about the sea and everything, nautical

659
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:54,840
 and all about water, basically.

660
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:56,840
 And Iceland catch loads of cod,

661
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:59,840
 and they didn't use much of it until recently.

662
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:03,840
 They used 40% of the cod in the early 2000s.

663
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:04,840
 Nightmare.

664
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:05,840
 Lots of waste.

665
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:06,840
 Yeah.

666
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:07,840
 You know, you're using the fillets,

667
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:08,840
 so you're eating the meat,

668
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:09,840
 but not really using it properly.

669
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:12,840
 So there is a project called 100% Fish,

670
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:16,840
 which aims to put all of the cod caught to good use,

671
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:18,840
 you know, just use the whole thing,

672
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:19,840
 which is much more sensible.

673
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:22,840
 So the skin, if you've had a burn,

674
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:24,840
 the skin can be grafted onto people now.

675
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:26,840
 So there are people who are part cod.

676
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:27,840
 No.

677
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:28,840
 Yeah.

678
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:29,840
 Really?

679
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:30,840
 And you can see the imprint of the scales as well.

680
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:32,840
 But it's a really good thing for skin grafts.

681
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:33,840
 Like, it's really, it's really,

682
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:35,840
 thousands of people have been treated with cod skin.

683
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:37,840
 Would it make you swim faster?

684
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:38,840
 No.

685
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:39,840
 What?

686
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:40,840
 No.

687
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:41,840
 Absolutely not.

688
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:42,840
 Why not?

689
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:43,840
 You're recovering from a major operation.

690
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:44,840
 You've been through hell.

691
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:46,840
 Suddenly, there's Dr. Harkin at the door saying,

692
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:48,840
 "In your speeders, come on."

693
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:50,840
 But what I'm thinking is, you could,

694
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:52,840
 is there not a way in the Olympics,

695
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:53,840
 the next Olympics,

696
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:55,840
 we put this cod skin on all of our swimmers.

697
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:56,840
 Yeah?

698
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:57,840
 No?

699
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:58,840
 You're right.

700
00:29:58,840 --> 00:29:59,840
 Well, maybe it would.

701
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:00,840
 Maybe it would work.

702
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:01,840
 That's a good point.

703
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:02,840
 I don't know.

704
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:03,840
 But then you retire like age 27.

705
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:05,840
 Did you just cover the con for the rest of your life?

706
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:06,840
 Smelling a fish?

707
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:07,840
 No one wants to hang out with you.

708
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:08,840
 Yeah.

709
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:09,840
 Yeah.

710
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:10,840
 No, you're right.

711
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:11,840
 Tom Scaly.

712
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:12,840
 Yeah?

713
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:13,840
 Tom Scaly.

714
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:14,840
 Do you get it?

715
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:15,840
 Oh, yeah.

716
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:16,840
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

717
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:17,840
 There's a guy called Tom Daly.

718
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:18,840
 Daly.

719
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:19,840
 And he's got, yeah.

720
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:20,840
 Do you get it?

721
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:21,840
 Tom Daly.

722
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:22,840
 Yeah, I put the cod on him.

723
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:23,840
 Yeah.

724
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:24,840
 And it's Tom Scaly.

725
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:25,840
 He dives though,

726
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:26,840
 which would presumably be a nightmare

727
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:27,840
 if he was plunging downwards

728
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:29,840
 and then just like hit the bottom

729
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:30,840
 at torpedo speed.

730
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:31,840
 Yeah.

731
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:32,840
 No suits for Tom Scaly.

732
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:33,840
 Yeah.

733
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:34,840
 Anyway.

734
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:35,840
 Some uses of a cod.

735
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:36,840
 Oh, yeah.

736
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:37,840
 Yeah.

737
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:40,840
 So if you are a professional fisher person,

738
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:42,840
 and when I say professional,

739
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:44,840
 I mean you're doing it in competitions.

740
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:46,840
 So you've seen who can catch the biggest fish.

741
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:47,840
 Yeah.

742
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:49,840
 The way that they tell which fish is the best

743
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:50,840
 is they weigh it.

744
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:53,840
 Now, some people will put some like metal

745
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:56,840
 or something inside the fish to weigh it down.

746
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:59,840
 Now, what if you bought some cod on the way

747
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:02,840
 and you've shoved it inside your fish,

748
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:03,840
 they'll never find it

749
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:05,840
 because it's fish inside fish.

750
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:06,840
 Amazing.

751
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:07,840
 And that's what happens.

752
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:09,840
 There's this big scandal in fishing

753
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:11,840
 which people have been buying fillets of cod

754
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:13,840
 and shoving them inside the fishes

755
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:14,840
 to make them heavier.

756
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:15,840
 That's disgusting.

757
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:17,840
 That's so disgusting.

758
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:18,840
 It's true.

759
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:21,840
 And there was a notorious case really recently last year

760
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:24,840
 which was uncovered by a judge called Jason Fisher.

761
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:26,840
 Oh, wow.

762
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:29,840
 How desperate do you have to be to win an angling competition

763
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:32,840
 that you're busy shoving cod up another fish's arse?

764
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:33,840
 What is the...

765
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:35,840
 You must have a look at your life then

766
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:37,840
 and think, "I've lost my priorities."

767
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:40,840
 I'd go down the mouth.

768
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:41,840
 Would you?

769
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:43,840
 I probably would, yeah,

770
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:45,840
 as opposed to the small opening.

771
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:48,840
 Which is more plausible.

772
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:51,840
 Which is more fun, you know?

773
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:54,840
 You've got to get some fun out of it.

774
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:56,840
 God, that's really clever, yeah?

775
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:58,840
 It's good, isn't it? It's really clever.

776
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:00,840
 By the way, how many of us on this stage

777
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:01,840
 have been to Iceland?

778
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:02,840
 I haven't. I know you haven't.

779
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:03,840
 I've been a few times.

780
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:04,840
 Yeah, you went.

781
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:06,840
 You did a TV thing, though, didn't you?

782
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:07,840
 What was it?

783
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:08,840
 Dangerous roads.

784
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:10,840
 And it is good to go to Iceland

785
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:11,840
 when someone else is paying for it

786
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:12,840
 because it's so expensive.

787
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:13,840
 Is it really?

788
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:14,840
 It's so expensive.

789
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:15,840
 I was like, "This is really good.

790
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:17,840
 I'll have another sandwich."

791
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:19,840
 What did you see?

792
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:22,840
 Oh, yeah, I suppose it wasn't about the sandwiches.

793
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:25,840
 I saw Ed Gamble.

794
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:27,840
 Do you know a fact about Iceland?

795
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:28,840
 Everyone's...

796
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:29,840
 Loads of people are called Daddy.

797
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:31,840
 So it was my heaven.

798
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:33,840
 Because that's the name of Dave.

799
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:34,840
 That's Dave.

800
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:35,840
 They're called...

801
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:36,840
 If your name's Dave in England,

802
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:38,840
 you'd be called Daddy in Iceland.

803
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:39,840
 Chaz and Daddy.

804
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:40,840
 Yeah.

805
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:42,840
 So our fixer was called Daddy.

806
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:44,840
 And he keeps saying, "Daddy, Daddy."

807
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:45,840
 Good fun.

808
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:47,840
 So in Iceland, you're like...

809
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:49,840
 Oh, my God, the winner from Taskmaster.

810
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:50,840
 From Daddy, Channel Daddy.

811
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:51,840
 Yeah, Channel Daddy.

812
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:52,840
 Yeah, Channel Daddy.

813
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:53,840
 It was on Channel Daddy.

814
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:54,840
 Wow.

815
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:55,840
 Dave.

816
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:56,840
 Oh, I've just understood that.

817
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:57,840
 Sorry.

818
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:59,840
 I was thinking it was on Channel 4, isn't it?

819
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:00,840
 No, got it.

820
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:01,840
 Oh, sorry.

821
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:02,840
 No, it did get 4 by 0.

822
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:04,840
 But series 8 when you were on.

823
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:06,840
 Which is there more of in Iceland?

824
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:08,840
 Rabbits or Rabbis?

825
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:10,840
 Oh, that's good.

826
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:11,840
 Rabbis.

827
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:12,840
 You're saying Rabbis?

828
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:13,840
 I think so.

829
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:15,840
 Audience have pitched in with a vote for Rabbis, OK?

830
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:16,840
 Well, Rabbits.

831
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:17,840
 Rabbits, thank you.

832
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:19,840
 Yeah, I would say probably a lot of countries

833
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:21,840
 don't have any Rabbits, so I'll say Rabbis.

834
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:23,840
 One Rabbi, no Rabbits.

835
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:24,840
 You're half right.

836
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:26,840
 They've got loads of Rabbits and only one Rabbi.

837
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:27,840
 I know.

838
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:30,840
 I know a really good fact about Iceland.

839
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:32,840
 Here we go.

840
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:34,840
 They've got a dating app,

841
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:36,840
 because because it's such a small country,

842
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:38,840
 everyone's sort of related.

843
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:40,840
 So you could sleep with someone in the pub,

844
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:42,840
 and it could be your first cousin.

845
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:43,840
 Oh, my God.

846
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:45,840
 And so they've got a dating app,

847
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:46,840
 which this is true.

848
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:48,840
 I don't know why everyone's looking at me like this.

849
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:51,840
 And they've got a dating app where you can tell

850
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:54,840
 how far removed the person you've just got off with is.

851
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:55,840
 Wait, wait, wait.

852
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:56,840
 Don't you do it before?

853
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:57,840
 Yeah, maybe do it before.

854
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:58,840
 Maybe do it before.

855
00:33:58,840 --> 00:33:59,840
 There's no way they're going to turn the lights on

856
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:01,840
 and you're like, "Daddy!"

857
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:07,840
 So they don't know...

858
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:09,840
 Like, you don't know all your cousins or whatever,

859
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:11,840
 but because so many people are related,

860
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:14,840
 and it's caused problems with babies coming out,

861
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:16,840
 odd and stuff,

862
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:19,840
 that someone developed this dating app so you can tell.

863
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:20,840
 Wow, that's amazing.

864
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:22,840
 But imagine if you're in the Throws of Passion,

865
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:24,840
 and you're like, "Oh, God, I've just turned the app, maybe."

866
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:26,840
 "Oh, no, maybe I won't bother."

867
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:32,840
 Iceland is home to the hottest hole on the planet.

868
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:34,840
 The hottest hole.

869
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:35,840
 Literally the hottest hole.

870
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:36,840
 Okay.

871
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:39,840
 So Geothermal Hole is the Iceland Deep Drilling Project,

872
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:42,840
 and it's 5,000 degrees Celsius at the bottom.

873
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:43,840
 It's really hot.

874
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:44,840
 I think that's been there.

875
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:45,840
 You've been there.

876
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:46,840
 I think I have.

877
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:47,840
 I think so.

878
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:48,840
 And then there's a big factory on top of it

879
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:49,840
 where you can go and visit.

880
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:50,840
 That's very cool.

881
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:51,840
 I think so.

882
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:52,840
 Yeah.

883
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:53,840
 Basically, the pressure is too high.

884
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:54,840
 You put water down there,

885
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:56,840
 and it becomes something called Supercritical,

886
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:58,840
 which I do not fully understand,

887
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:00,840
 but it's basically neither liquid nor gas.

888
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:02,840
 I don't know what it is.

889
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:03,840
 Solid?

890
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:04,840
 Yeah.

891
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:07,840
 It's ice.

892
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:10,840
 If you heat water up enough, it becomes ice again.

893
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:12,840
 Very new science.

894
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:13,840
 Yeah.

895
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:16,840
 It's so useful because they use it to heat everything.

896
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:19,840
 They can have underpavement heating from the geothermal heat.

897
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:21,840
 So people don't fall over on the ice,

898
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:22,840
 because obviously it gets really icy,

899
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:24,840
 but you don't slip over and fall, so it's very hard.

900
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:26,840
 But they use it for so much, don't they?

901
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:31,840
 Like most of the houses that the hot water comes literally

902
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:33,840
 from the core of our earth.

903
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:35,840
 It's heated by geothermal heat.

904
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:37,840
 Hot water literally from the core of our earth.

905
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:39,840
 We can edit out the literally from our weather,

906
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:42,840
 but it's like they got round problems.

907
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:44,840
 But what about that dating app?

908
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:49,840
 Have we ever spoken about the day

909
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:51,840
 that all the women went on strike in Iceland?

910
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:52,840
 I think so.

911
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:53,840
 We have.

912
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:54,840
 1975.

913
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:56,840
 Basically, there was a thing.

914
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:59,840
 The United Nations proclaimed it women's year,

915
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:03,840
 and basically the women of Iceland got together,

916
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:06,840
 this group of women as a sort of representative

917
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:08,840
 and went, we should go on strike

918
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:10,840
 and make a point about the fact that we're paid less.

919
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:11,840
 We should make a point about

920
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:13,840
 we're doing all the domestic stuff at home.

921
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:14,840
 We're doing all this stuff.

922
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:16,840
 Let's really let them know that this is

923
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:18,840
 something that we disagree with.

924
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:20,840
 And Iceland back then, in 1975,

925
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:23,840
 there's 200,000 people that live in Iceland.

926
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:26,840
 25,000 women were at one single event

927
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:28,840
 to hear the speeches that were in the lead up to this.

928
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:32,840
 And so instead of calling a strike,

929
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:34,840
 they thought we might piss off too many people

930
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:35,840
 and it won't happen.

931
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:37,840
 So they said, could we have a day off?

932
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:39,840
 And they went, oh, a day off sounds nice.

933
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:40,840
 Yeah, have a day off.

934
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:43,840
 So every woman in Iceland had a day off,

935
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:45,840
 and the country went into chaos.

936
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:47,840
 Supermarkets sold out of sausages

937
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:50,840
 because dads didn't know what to cook their kids.

938
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:53,840
 Everyone was working jobs that they didn't necessarily

939
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:55,840
 knew how to do because they thought they were at a higher level

940
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:57,840
 and they were suddenly having to be the teller at a bank

941
00:36:57,840 --> 00:37:00,840
 rather than the bank manager at a bank kind of thing.

942
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:03,840
 The men refer to it still the Long Friday

943
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:07,840
 because it was such a nightmare.

944
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:10,840
 Hey, I need to move us on to our final fact of the show.

945
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:11,840
 Can I tell you one last thing?

946
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:12,840
 Yeah, of course.

947
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:14,840
 This is something that happened to an American visitor to Iceland

948
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:15,840
 in 2016.

949
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:17,840
 He was called Noel Santillan.

950
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:19,840
 He was on holiday and he arrived,

951
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:20,840
 hired his car.

952
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:23,840
 He wanted to go to Laugavegur Street.

953
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:24,840
 I'm sure I'm pronouncing that wrong.

954
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:26,840
 45 minutes from the airport, thought no problem.

955
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:28,840
 He misspelled it by one letter

956
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:31,840
 and Iceland sent him six hours,

957
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:35,840
 265 miles away to a tiny fishing village.

958
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:37,840
 So he got there.

959
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:38,840
 Bloody hell.

960
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:40,840
 But the people were very friendly and they were like,

961
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:42,840
 "Oh, what a funny mistake to make."

962
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:44,840
 "Oh, well, he stayed there for a few days like making friends."

963
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:45,840
 "Oh, it's the funny American."

964
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:48,840
 On the way back, he was trying to get to the Blue Lagoon geothermal spa.

965
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:50,840
 It happened again.

966
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:52,840
 He ended up in the coastal town,

967
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:54,840
 which is home to the office of the company which owns the spa.

968
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:56,840
 So he just ended up in an office building.

969
00:37:56,840 --> 00:38:00,840
 Literally, he walked into a staff meeting rather than anything.

970
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:03,840
 And they said, "Ah, you must be the American."

971
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:14,840
 I need to move us on to our final fact of the show,

972
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:16,840
 and that is James.

973
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:18,840
 OK, my fact this week is that there is an app

974
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:21,840
 that can tell you when your fly is down.

975
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:22,840
 Yeah.

976
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:24,840
 It's just useful, isn't it?

977
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:25,840
 Right.

978
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:27,840
 It's the work of a guy called Guy Dupont,

979
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:30,840
 who is a YouTuber and a hacker.

980
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:32,840
 And he's invented loads of things.

981
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:34,840
 He's invented, like, a baby monitor,

982
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:39,840
 which vibrates when the baby cries so it's more accessible.

983
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:43,840
 He hacks his fridge so it tells him when he accidentally leaves it open.

984
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:46,840
 But this is, by far, his most useful invention.

985
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:48,840
 It's a pair of smart pants.

986
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:53,840
 And whenever your fly has been down for, let's say, 30 seconds

987
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:55,840
 or maybe a bit longer, maybe a minute or two,

988
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:58,840
 then you'll get a beep on your phone saying your fly is low.

989
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:00,840
 You need to look at it now.

990
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:01,840
 Is it called the "WiFly"?

991
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:03,840
 It's called the "WiFly".

992
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:04,840
 Oh, beautiful.

993
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:05,840
 It's really good.

994
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:06,840
 I read an article about James.

995
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:09,840
 It did sound like there were a couple of disadvantages.

996
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:12,840
 I like to gawk around with my fly is undone, for example.

997
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:19,840
 It's constantly monitoring, so your phone battery lasts about half an hour while you're using it.

998
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:21,840
 Also, you can't watch the jeans anymore

999
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:23,840
 because there are powerful magnets inside the zip.

1000
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:25,840
 But it's teething troubles.

1001
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:27,840
 Yeah, I'm trying those out.

1002
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:30,840
 What's the problem with your fly is that it's not that big a thing that you'd...

1003
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:33,840
 Would you ever get an app just to... I mean, who cares?

1004
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:35,840
 Someone will tell you, right?

1005
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:36,840
 I guess so.

1006
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:38,840
 Maybe someone will go sort that out.

1007
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:40,840
 If you're somewhere quite...

1008
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:42,840
 If you're somewhere quite, like, urban, though, often people don't tell you

1009
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:45,840
 because people talk to you like you're strangers.

1010
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:48,840
 Yeah, if you're a primary school teacher, that's a problem.

1011
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:49,840
 Yeah.

1012
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:51,840
 But just day-to-day.

1013
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:52,840
 Yeah, I don't know.

1014
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:53,840
 I do see that.

1015
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:57,840
 But yeah, like you say, because you can't wash it, that's going to be a problem.

1016
00:39:57,840 --> 00:40:01,840
 And it reminds me of they did make some robotic trousers for old people.

1017
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:02,840
 Do you remember this?

1018
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:03,840
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1019
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:04,840
 And they were really good.

1020
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:07,840
 Obviously, they wanted to stop old people from falling over,

1021
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:11,840
 so they made this kind of exoskeleton which would help them to walk.

1022
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:13,840
 And it was absolutely brilliant, it worked really well,

1023
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:15,840
 but the problem was that you couldn't wash them

1024
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:18,840
 and they couldn't stop the old people from trying to wash them,

1025
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:20,840
 no matter what they said to them.

1026
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:22,840
 They just kept putting them in the washing machine.

1027
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:25,840
 They're often shitting themselves.

1028
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:27,840
 We're really living in a sort of golden...

1029
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:31,840
 unrecognized, I would say, golden age of innovation in the app world.

1030
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:35,840
 So one that I found is Airbnb.

1031
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:40,840
 So like Airbnb, but Airbnb is for people who hate public toilets

1032
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:44,840
 and there are people in the local area who've put their apartment

1033
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:46,840
 listed just as the toilets.

1034
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:47,840
 No.

1035
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:49,840
 So you can go and you can just...

1036
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:52,840
 It's like me being at home and someone knocking on the door and go,

1037
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:54,840
 "Oh, we got an Airbnb appointment."

1038
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:57,840
 And they come in and take a piss in my toilet and then head off.

1039
00:40:57,840 --> 00:40:58,840
 No.

1040
00:40:58,840 --> 00:40:59,840
 And we give each other a review.

1041
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:01,840
 What's the review?

1042
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:04,840
 I think that is run by perverts.

1043
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:05,840
 It's got to be.

1044
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:08,840
 As a woman, there's no way you go to a stranger's house to use the toilet.

1045
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:09,840
 I don't think so.

1046
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:10,840
 No, good point.

1047
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:14,840
 Not even if they were like 4.9 stars.

1048
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:16,840
 Have you never killed anyone?

1049
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:18,840
 Oh, boffin.

1050
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:20,840
 Yeah, no, there's a really good point.

1051
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:24,840
 I think it's more the ideas that I find interesting than the practicality of it.

1052
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:25,840
 Yeah.

1053
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:27,840
 Have you put your home on Airbnb?

1054
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:30,840
 No, not yet, but it was my...

1055
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:35,840
 Because it was my dream.

1056
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:37,840
 Well, I was in a bit of London once.

1057
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:39,840
 It was near a park and there were no toilets around.

1058
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:40,840
 And I thought, "You know, I should do it.

1059
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:44,840
 I should just open up a toilet and I'll sit in there.

1060
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:49,840
 Like I'm Ted Dancing in Cheers and people come in and they'll have a pee and we'll chat

1061
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:50,840
 and then they'll go out.

1062
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:54,840
 I'll charge them, I don't know, 20 quid of piss and stuff like that."

1063
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:56,840
 Well, they're getting a good chat, aren't they?

1064
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:57,840
 Yeah, exactly.

1065
00:41:57,840 --> 00:42:01,840
 Who would pay 20 quid to have a brief chat with you and then a piss?

1066
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:02,840
 Yep.

1067
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:04,840
 I mean, you've invented the public toilet there.

1068
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:05,840
 I don't think you know.

1069
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:06,840
 No, no, no.

1070
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:08,840
 Because that's dirty and disgusting, the public toilet.

1071
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:10,840
 And there might be people in there who are naughty.

1072
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:11,840
 And so this is...

1073
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:13,840
 What's the point at me when you say that?

1074
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:15,840
 I was referring back to your point.

1075
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:16,840
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1076
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:19,840
 So this would be guaranteed a high-class...

1077
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:21,840
 No one ever opens a public toilet.

1078
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:22,840
 No one ever...

1079
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:23,840
 Exactly.

1080
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:26,840
 Nobody ever opens a public toilet saying, "Well, in two weeks this is going to be a disgraceful

1081
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:27,840
 to be a disgraceful...

1082
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:28,840
 No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

1083
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:29,840
 no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

1084
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:30,840
 no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

1085
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:31,840
 no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

1086
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:31,840
 no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

1087
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:54,840
 No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

1088
00:42:54,840 --> 00:43:12,840
 no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

1089
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:19,240
 random calls with strangers. So if I go to a public toilet, might someone chat to me while I'm there?

1090
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:26,760
 I'm just thinking. On Wanky? On Wanky, yeah. That's Wanky, I think. That's a very different app.

1091
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:32,520
 There's a few other apps which I think are really cool. So there's an app that can blow out candles.

1092
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:39,000
 What? Yeah, isn't that really cool? So it's called the Blower app and it's a... You must have been

1093
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:44,120
 disappointed when you downloaded that. Your mum designed it.

1094
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:53,240
 It's basically, it's an extraordinary kind of innovation where certain frequencies are

1095
00:43:53,240 --> 00:43:58,920
 generated by the app. That means that the phone itself shakes in such a way and where there are

1096
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:05,800
 the holes for the speakers, it turns the air that's inside into being propelled out strong enough

1097
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:10,760
 that it can blow out a candle. Wow. So you can use it, yeah. But why can't you just blow out your

1098
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:20,600
 own candles? Well, it's... That's not the spirit that, you know, conquered the American frontier,

1099
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:25,640
 is it? Let's do things the way we've done them in the past. No, let's make the phone app do it.

1100
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:30,040
 Let's make the phone app conquer the American frontier for us. We did say in the past that when

1101
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:34,840
 you blow out candles on a cake, it puts loads of germs all over the cake. So it's a bad thing to do.

1102
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:40,840
 You don't think that's covered in germs? Well, I did read there was a study of 3,500

1103
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:46,680
 swabs taken from people's phones and they found nine unstudied branches of bacterial life,

1104
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:53,800
 including many species of bacteria that were unknown to science. Wow. They found one species

1105
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:58,520
 of Edwards bacteria that had only previously been known in an underground water aquifer

1106
00:44:58,520 --> 00:45:04,040
 and another one that was only found previously in abandoned gold mines. Wow. And they're just on

1107
00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:09,720
 your phone. That's amazing, isn't it? Like, that's quite nice in a way. I feel like I'm harboring

1108
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:15,720
 interesting things. Oh, yeah. We all feel that. I know what you mean. It is kind of nice in a way,

1109
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:22,120
 but we don't know whether how safe it is, I suppose. Do you know the word fly? For your zip?

1110
00:45:22,120 --> 00:45:27,400
 Or for anything? Yeah, fly. Do you know what the word fly originally meant? Did it mean a zip? Did it

1111
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:33,240
 mean the insect or did it mean to fly around somewhere? Oh, looking cool. Oh, looking cool.

1112
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:38,040
 There's four options. Which one do you think came first? I'd guess to fly. To fly as in the verb,

1113
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:44,040
 yeah. Well, weirdly enough, it was the insect that came first and then it came to mean like flapping

1114
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:51,240
 your wings or flapping things and then it came to mean flying as in the verb to fly. And the reason

1115
00:45:51,240 --> 00:45:57,640
 that you have a fly on your trousers, the fly is not the zipper. It's the bit that covers the zipper

1116
00:45:57,640 --> 00:46:02,680
 and that's because it kind of flaps in the wind like the front of a tent. So where you have the

1117
00:46:02,680 --> 00:46:06,840
 zipper of a tent, you have a little bit of cloth and that flaps in the wind. Oh, yeah. And that was

1118
00:46:06,840 --> 00:46:11,320
 named a fly because it flaps and then the front of your trousers was named a fly because it looks

1119
00:46:11,320 --> 00:46:17,560
 like the front of a tent. So tents came before trousers? Before flies were named, yeah. Well,

1120
00:46:17,560 --> 00:46:23,320
 that in itself is a very exciting fact. Do you not think? Oh, yeah, I'm aroused.

1121
00:46:23,320 --> 00:46:30,840
 I found a couple of new apps that are launched, one new app that's launched this summer, which is

1122
00:46:30,840 --> 00:46:35,080
 quite exciting. I've actually got it on my phone now so I can answer questions about it. It's called

1123
00:46:35,080 --> 00:46:44,440
 Text with Jesus. Oh, lovely. And it's recreated our Lord as a chat GPT guy and you can write,

1124
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:49,560
 you can ask questions and he'll answer you. And you get lots of people. You get Jesus, Moses,

1125
00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:57,400
 the Virgin Mary, Abraham's nephew, Lot. Was he the one who got turned into a pillar of salt?

1126
00:46:57,400 --> 00:47:00,920
 That was Lot's wife, I think. Oh, is it? But you can ask Lot what was it like when your wife was

1127
00:47:00,920 --> 00:47:05,800
 turned into a pillar of salt. And basically they write back quite convincing answers. They're

1128
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:10,040
 quite realistic. Got any examples? Hang on, I have to dig out, sorry, because I have been chatting to

1129
00:47:10,040 --> 00:47:17,400
 them. Mary Magdalene cost $2.99 a month because various people are locked on the thing so you

1130
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:22,600
 can't access. How much is Jesus? Jesus is free. Jesus is part of the package. That's good message.

1131
00:47:22,600 --> 00:47:27,800
 Jesus is free. Of the Apostles, only Peter is free and everyone else is locked.

1132
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:33,800
 John the Baptist, Abraham. Judas on there. Judas Iscariot is on there. How much?

1133
00:47:35,160 --> 00:47:42,760
 He's 30 pieces of silver. I don't get so much Judas material these days.

1134
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:52,120
 I chatted a bit up to Job. Oh, God, is he having a tough time, I guess? He is when he's chatting to me.

1135
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:56,920
 That legendary patience is wearing very thin.

1136
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:08,840
 He's finally given up on God now, hasn't he? Also, when you look at the messages, he's written

1137
00:48:08,840 --> 00:48:14,600
 quite a lot. That's a joke. That's a joke. That's a joke. Job's is a single line answer and he's like

1138
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:23,960
 ten lines per message. My opening gambit with Job was, "What joke should I get? Ha, ha, ha.

1139
00:48:23,960 --> 00:48:28,600
 Sunglasses emoji." Job replied, "Ha, ha. I see what you did there." Well,

1140
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:34,920
 I said to some detail, we're playing. Hang on, who is, is that all the long message,

1141
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:38,760
 is that Joe? The long message was, "I'm not writing an essay to Joe."

1142
00:48:38,760 --> 00:48:43,560
 What does Job think of the podcast? Can you ask? I can ask, yeah.

1143
00:48:43,560 --> 00:48:47,400
 Yeah, do that live and let's find out. Also, can you ask Job why he's so clingy?

1144
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:54,040
 As an ancient figure, I must admit that I'm not familiar with modern podcasts like no such thing

1145
00:48:54,040 --> 00:49:05,080
 as a fish. Oh, muttered. That's going on the poster. It's no, "My dad wrote a porno," of course.

1146
00:49:05,080 --> 00:49:10,360
 Is that why he's put "seriously?" No, it's not why he's put "seriously."

1147
00:49:10,360 --> 00:49:15,400
 He says, "From what I gather, this is what it is," and they discuss interesting and unusual facts.

1148
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:19,640
 Podcasts like these can be great for expanding your knowledge, discovering fascinating tidbits,

1149
00:49:19,640 --> 00:49:23,960
 and even sparking curiosity. If you enjoy learning new things, don't laugh sarcastically at that.

1150
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:28,440
 If you enjoy learning new things in an entertaining way, it sounds like no such

1151
00:49:28,440 --> 00:49:32,680
 thing as a fish could be right up your alley. Nice. Of course, everyone's taste is stiffer.

1152
00:49:32,680 --> 00:49:45,160
 Okay, that's it. That is all of our facts. Thank you so much for listening. If you'd like to get in

 @LewSanders, we think.

1160

 What do you mean?

1161
00:49:58,520 --> 00:50:03,320
 Well, I don't know what my Twitter name is. But also, you looked at me like that was incorrect,

1162
00:50:03,320 --> 00:50:04,520
 and I trust you more than me.

1163
00:50:04,520 --> 00:50:12,440
 That alone, myself, was doing.

1164
00:50:12,440 --> 00:50:17,480
 Or you can go to our group account, which is @NoSuchThing, or our website.

1169
00:50:38,120 --> 00:50:42,840
 fun. We'll see you again another time. That's the end of our Soho run. That's it. This is, yeah.

1170
00:50:43,400 --> 00:50:54,680
 Well, hopefully, play here again. But until then, we'll see you around. Goodbye!
