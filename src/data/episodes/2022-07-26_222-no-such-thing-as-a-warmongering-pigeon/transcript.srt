00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,420
 Hey guys, just a quick announcement before we start this week's show, which is that we have a special bit of news.

2
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:07,900
 We have released an audio cassette.

3
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:10,980
 Yes, that's right, but it's not your normal audio cassette.

4
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:20,080
 This is like a futuristic year 3000 cassette because in it, it contains not just your average 50 minutes that an audio cassette would.

5
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:22,960
 We have over 1,900 minutes on this.

6
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:27,260
 It's true. It's a USB audio cassette. It's amazing. It looks like an audio cassette.

7
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:32,640
 There's USB pops out and on it, it's got the complete second year of fish, which you may have noticed.

8
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,700
 We've taken down from the website and we've put it onto this cassette.

9
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:43,160
 Yeah, and it's also got a special filmed episode with never before seen, never again seen, but it's filmed.

10
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:51,000
 Yeah, that's right. We filmed it in our natural habitat, the QI office in Covent Garden, around the table that we started the whole podcast on.

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:58,140
 I have to say, it's got for me, personally, my favorite fact that I found in all four years of doing the podcast. It's very exciting.

12
00:00:58,140 --> 00:00:59,780
 It's a very good fact when you hear it.

13
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:04,460
 You won't believe fact number three. It's fact number four.

14
00:01:04,460 --> 00:01:11,740
 But yeah, if you can get it by going to qi.com/casset, and I do encourage you just to go there, just to look at it.

15
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:20,200
 It's a thing of beauty. It's absolutely stunning. It's this retro item, you know? It's a proper cassette, the casing, the booklet, everything is there, and it's yellow.

16
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:27,660
 It is yellow. The actual cassette is yellow, so qi.com/casset. All right, on with the show. On with the show live from Melbourne, Australia.

17
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:48,580
 Hello, and welcome to another episode of no such thing as a fish, a weekly podcast this week coming to you from Melbourne!

18
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:57,820
 [Cheering and Applause]

19
00:01:57,820 --> 00:02:12,820
 My name is Dan Schreiber, and I am sitting here with Anacizanski, Andrew Huntamari, and James Harkin, and once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days, and in no particular order, here we go.

20
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:16,420
 Starting with you, Andrew Huntamari.

21
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:23,440
 My fact is that there was a showman in the 1930s who's act consisted of repeatedly crashing his plane into the ground.

22
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,260
 [Laughter]

23
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:27,020
 This is such an amazing guy, so this fact...

24
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:28,980
 Oh, sorry, Andy, how do you repeatedly crash?

25
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:31,400
 Surely you can only crash a plane once into the ground?

26
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:38,260
 That's a very good point. He sequentially crashed separate planes into the ground. Let the record show.

27
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:48,600
 So, this fact was actually sent in to us. To me, by a guy called Cameron Dawkins, so Cameron, thank you very much for this, and I looked into him a bit more, the showman, not Cameron Dawkins.

28
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,600
 [Laughter]

29
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,140
 Do you not care about Cameron at all?

30
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:53,840
 I do. He said you were fat.

31
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:54,540
 That's true.

32
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:58,300
 All right, I've researched Cameron Dawkins' life. We're here to tell you some home truths.

33
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:00,280
 Andy, all the research we've done is on Cameron.

34
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:00,900
 Oh, no.

35
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:05,900
 [Laughter]

36
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:08,300
 Cameron was born in 1982.

37
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:13,300
 [Laughter]

38
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:17,600
 Okay. No, the guy's name, the showman's name, he was called Frank Freaks.

39
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:20,760
 What a cool name. He was from Tennessee, and his speciality.

40
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:25,640
 He was an aerial showman, so he did lots of stuff, so he did loop the loops, and he did all sorts of acrobatics with his plane.

41
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:34,840
 But his special trick was crashing planes into trees, lakes, pre-built houses, and sometimes just smashing them right into the ground.

42
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:39,300
 He would buy a very old clunky plane, so obviously planes were very, very basic in these days.

43
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:44,300
 He would buy a really old clunky plane, he would get it just air-worthy, and then he would crash it.

44
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:46,180
 Yeah, and he was very honest about his career.

45
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:51,540
 He said, "I admit, I fool the public. Everyone who goes out there will expect to see me get killed, but I won't."

46
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:52,780
 [Laughter]

47
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:55,780
 It's amazing. You can see footage of this online.

48
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:57,380
 There's all these old newsreels with this.

49
00:03:57,380 --> 00:04:03,820
 See, Frank, as he is that kind of voice, and you see him go through houses, and there's one great clip

50
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:08,100
 where he misses the house because the plane actually goes out of control.

51
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:15,780
 He loses genuine control of it, and he plummets, and you see him plummet in the distance, and by pure coincidence, he plummeted onto a car.

52
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:21,980
 So everyone was just as happy, because he still hit a thing, apart from the guy driving the car, just like...

53
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:26,020
 And he was, yeah, he was badly hurt, but he, um...

54
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:29,660
 And we're definitely sure he wasn't just a very bad pilot.

55
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:36,060
 Oh, all the time. The whole time. His actors actually watched me stay flying.

56
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:44,020
 He was sponsored by Camel Cigarettes, as everyone in those days, so actually, if you Google him, and if you look at sort of old sources from the time,

57
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:48,100
 the only thing that mentions him are cigarette adverts, where he just...

58
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:52,260
 It's so weird adverts in those days in the '30s, because you'll get, like, a really long form piece.

59
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:56,900
 Paragraph after paragraph about his career, and then the closing line will be something like...

60
00:04:56,900 --> 00:05:01,420
 And below you see him having performed this stunt, and ready to enjoy his favourite smoke, Camel's.

61
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:07,340
 And yeah, and there'll be little cartoons of him, where he'd say, "I always smoke Camel's, I could smoke as many as I want,

62
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:10,740
 and I feel fresh, never jittery, and never upset."

63
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:16,340
 Yes, yes, my job is dangerous, but I tell you what's even more dangerous, a lifetime of smoking.

64
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:17,820
 Camel Cigarettes.

65
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:25,220
 So, um, the civil aviation authority didn't like this guy, did they?

66
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:29,460
 Right. They kept trying to shut him down, and all he'd do was just move to a different state,

67
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:31,580
 where they couldn't get hold of him.

68
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:37,460
 And so, one time, he was flying in Florida, and he crashed his plane, and everyone thought he was really injured,

69
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:41,660
 so an ambulance came and put him in the ambulance, and then they drove off,

70
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:46,980
 and then they got to state lines, he jumped out, and then ran off, and then did a show in the next day and next day.

71
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:48,420
 That's so amazing.

72
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:50,220
 It was very popular back then, wasn't it?

73
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:51,660
 What do you do in these, like, tricks and stuff?

74
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:56,700
 Do it, yeah, particularly air flights and air stunts. It was basically, after the First World War,

75
00:05:56,700 --> 00:06:00,140
 there was this massive surplus of airplanes, and the government didn't know what to do with them.

76
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:02,180
 And so, they sold them for nothing.

77
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:06,540
 I think, actually, they would sell the petrol in the tank, and it came with a free plane, sometimes.

78
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:07,540
 Wow.

79
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:12,940
 And so, all these amateurs just bought up all these planes and became stuntmen, and it was a huge deal.

80
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:16,700
 And we've mentioned it before on the podcast, but what they used to do was a thing called barnstorming,

81
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:21,140
 where a group of them would go and fly over a town, and they would land in a field,

82
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:24,620
 they would ask for permission to put on a massive show, and if they got the permission,

83
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:27,580
 they would drop leaflets out of the plane saying, "Come and watch our show."

84
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:33,500
 So, they traveled in a pack, they were a tour, like a flying circus that would come in and do their show.

85
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:37,780
 And then some people think that the barnstorming word comes from crashing into these barns,

86
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:40,740
 like this guy did, he crashed into pre-fat buildings, didn't he?

87
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:41,420
 Yeah.

88
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:42,980
 Do you know his other act?

89
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:49,180
 It was called the Casket of Death, and he would climb into a barrel, which would be reinforced,

90
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:53,100
 blow it up with dynamite, from inside, and then jump out.

91
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:54,900
 Wow.

92
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:56,380
 I don't know. He just looked...

93
00:06:56,380 --> 00:07:00,380
 What you're saying is that he's in the same place as a dynamite, they're both inside the barrel.

94
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:01,380
 Yes.

95
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:03,380
 I would have had at least the barrel in between me and the dynamite.

96
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:06,380
 Well, that's why your circus act failed.

97
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:10,380
 James safely blows up a barrel at a distance.

98
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:12,380
 It's no peril.

99
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:19,260
 There was another guy called the Salamander, and he would...

100
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:24,100
 He had a death slide, which it was like a bobsleigh, with a cradle of lit fireworks underneath him,

101
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:28,900
 but he also did a trick where he poured a pile of gunpowder along his neck and arm to a pile in his hand,

102
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:34,540
 and his assistant would set fire to the gunpowder in his collarbone and when he got to his hands, it would blow up.

103
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:38,220
 But he only did it apparently on special occasions.

104
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:42,220
 He only ever did it twice, didn't he?

105
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:47,180
 But gunpowder based on, so I think, were quite a thing.

106
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:50,500
 Again, because the war just happened, people were quite into blowing things up,

107
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:55,460
 and in the '30s, in Germany, rocket cycling was quite a big deal,

108
00:07:55,460 --> 00:08:00,940
 and so this was tying big sticks of dynamite to a bike and then lighting it,

109
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:02,620
 and then it propels you in your rocket.

110
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:05,540
 There was a guy called Herr Richter, who was good at this, he...

111
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:09,700
 There was another guy called Wiley-Coyote, who was good at it.

112
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:16,020
 Yeah, he... So this guy, he tied 12 rockets to his bike and then he called it Rakentenrod,

113
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:20,460
 and when he hit 55 miles an hour, the first time he did it, all they all exploded and he flew off

114
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:24,900
 and traveled about 50 yards into a hedge, I think, but he kept it up.

115
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:29,580
 It is weird, they used to, um, the Daredevil, it was a job that suddenly boomed

116
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:31,940
 where people were answering adverts in the newspaper.

117
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:36,980
 This is a genuine one from 1931, wanted single man, not over 25,

118
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:42,020
 to drive automobile in head-on collision with another car.

119
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:44,780
 Must crash with another car at 40 miles an hour

120
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:48,900
 and give unconditional release in case of injury or death.

121
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:52,620
 Name your lowest price.

122
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:54,620
 And these are, like, if you picture the cars as well,

123
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:57,380
 if you picture in your head just old cars of the olden days,

124
00:08:57,380 --> 00:09:00,740
 those are the ones that were flying over buses and they couldn't get much speed

125
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:03,580
 and it's pretty extraordinary to look at all the photos at the time.

126
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:06,140
 Yeah, they weren't that kind of flimsy, weren't they?

127
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:09,940
 And then, because another thing they used to do was travel in a car,

128
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:13,100
 a little bike with a side car, with a lion in it.

129
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:16,500
 This was another popular thing and they actually had a name.

130
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:20,100
 I think they were called lion drones, so they'd go round a velodrome,

131
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:24,260
 but on a motorbike and there'd be, sometimes there'd be a lion in your side car.

132
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:27,500
 And then there was another one where you were riding around a velodrome

133
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:30,740
 on your motorbike and a bunch of lions got released and chased you.

134
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:35,140
 Wow, come up it and just charged after you.

135
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:37,140
 This is entertainment, sounds great.

136
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:39,140
 Yeah, that's cool.

137
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:42,540
 The first person to do a loop, the loop in an aeroplane,

138
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:48,540
 was a Soviet guy called Piotr Nesterov and he was immediately arrested

139
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:51,740
 for risking government property.

140
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:57,500
 And then, a few months later, there was a French guy who did it called Adolf Pegu

141
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:01,140
 and he became world famous and then the Soviets went,

142
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:03,500
 maybe he shouldn't have arrested that guy after all.

143
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:06,500
 And they took him out of prison and he was promoted to staff captain

144
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:07,700
 and awarded a medal.

145
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:08,700
 Really?

146
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:09,900
 Wow.

147
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:11,300
 That's so funny.

148
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:14,700
 Have you ever heard, obviously, jumping out of a moving plane is very dangerous?

149
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:16,900
 Have you ever heard of jumping into a moving plane?

150
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:17,900
 No.

151
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:19,300
 This is a thing that some people do.

152
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:23,500
 What, if you're really late for your flight?

153
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:24,500
 I'm serious, this has been done.

154
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:29,900
 It was first done in 1997 and then last year, 2017, two guys recreated it

155
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:31,220
 at two French daredevils.

156
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:35,220
 So what happens is, you jump out of the aircraft, you're wearing a wing suit,

157
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:39,820
 you then fly until you've caught up with the aircraft, which is flying downwards,

158
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:41,820
 and then you jump back into it.

159
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:42,820
 Wow.

160
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:43,820
 It's not as rare.

161
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:45,820
 It is also one for special occasions, only guys.

162
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:46,820
 Wow.

163
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:47,820
 Well, check this story out.

164
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:49,820
 I was reading about a guy called Graham Donald.

165
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:54,820
 He was a pilot in 1917 and he was attempting for the first time in a plane

166
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:56,820
 that's called a Soppwith camel.

167
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:57,820
 Yeah.

168
00:10:57,820 --> 00:10:59,820
 So he was attempting his first loop, the loop.

169
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:03,020
 He went up 6,000 feet and he got to the peak of his loop, the loop.

170
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:07,820
 He was upside down and his belt snapped and he fell out.

171
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:09,020
 He disappeared out of the plane.

172
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:10,020
 Yeah.

173
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:12,020
 Now, 55 years later, he tells a story.

174
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:13,020
 Oh, it was.

175
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:17,420
 I'm going to say 55 years later, he landed.

176
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:18,920
 So, check this out.

177
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:21,820
 He's upside down, the belt snapped and he falls out.

178
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:23,420
 He plummets 5,000 feet.

179
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:27,820
 But because he was in the middle of a loop, the loop maneuver, his plane came back down.

180
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:28,820
 Oh, yeah.

181
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:29,820
 No.

182
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:30,820
 Yeah.

183
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:31,820
 This is his story.

184
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:34,820
 He landed on the wing of the plane with 2,000 feet to go.

185
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:35,820
 He got it.

186
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:36,820
 Yes.

187
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:37,820
 OK.

188
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:38,820
 There are 1,000 people here.

189
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:39,820
 Does anyone believe that story?

190
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:41,820
 Give us a chance.

191
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:43,820
 Graham Donald.

192
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:44,820
 Check him out.

193
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:45,820
 1917.

194
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:46,820
 A thousand.

195
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:47,820
 But it doesn't matter if he said it.

196
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:48,820
 He's obviously delusional.

197
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:49,820
 A thousand percent not true.

198
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:50,820
 No.

199
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:51,820
 He's incredible.

200
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:53,820
 He met it on the bottom of the loop.

201
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:54,820
 On the wing.

202
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:56,820
 It is literally incredible.

203
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:59,820
 How did the plane know where to go?

204
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:01,820
 Because he had it in the loop maneuver.

205
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:02,820
 It was just following its path.

206
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:03,820
 It was a natural path.

207
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:05,820
 That's not how physics works.

208
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:08,820
 It was just going to strike.

209
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:10,820
 It got a tangent.

210
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:16,820
 He said the first 2,000 feet passed very quickly and terra firmer looked damn firmer.

211
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:20,820
 As I fell, I began to hear my faithful little camel somewhere nearby.

212
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:22,820
 Suddenly, I fell back onto her.

213
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:26,820
 Maybe he was talking about the cigarettes coming.

214
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:28,820
 And he made a good landing.

215
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:29,820
 He's a hero.

216
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:33,820
 We're going to have to move on to our next facts.

217
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:34,820
 All right.

218
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:36,820
 Do you guys know?

219
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:38,820
 Do you guys know Tommy Fitzpatrick?

220
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:39,820
 No.

221
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:41,820
 My favorite stunt man.

222
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:44,820
 In 1956, he was really drunk in a pub in New York.

223
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:46,820
 He made a bet with his friend there.

224
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:49,820
 That in 15 minutes, he'll be back at that pub in an aeroplane.

225
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:53,820
 And then he went to an airport in New Jersey.

226
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:54,820
 He stole a plane.

227
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:57,820
 He landed it on St Nicholas Avenue in Manhattan.

228
00:12:57,820 --> 00:12:59,820
 Between a whole bunch of cars.

229
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:02,820
 And in complete darkness, no lights on the plane, nothing.

230
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:04,820
 And he rocked up back in the bar.

231
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:06,820
 And he said, hey guys, I did it.

232
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:08,820
 I suspect it took him longer than 15 minutes.

233
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:10,820
 He was charged with grand lasty.

234
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:12,820
 But the owner of the plane didn't press charges.

235
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:13,820
 So he got away with it.

236
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:17,820
 And two years later, he was in the same bar telling the story.

237
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:19,820
 And the person he was telling didn't believe him.

238
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:21,820
 So he did the exact same thing again.

239
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:23,820
 [LAUGHTER]

240
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:28,820
 OK.

241
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:30,820
 It is time for fact number two.

242
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:31,820
 And that is my fact.

243
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:35,820
 My fact this week is that a new scientific study has shown

244
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:38,820
 that people who claim to know a lot of facts don't actually

245
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:40,820
 know as many facts as they think they do.

246
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:43,820
 [LAUGHTER]

247
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:45,820
 Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

248
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:48,820
 What does it say about people who don't know that many facts?

249
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:51,820
 And that the few facts that they do say are often described as dubious.

250
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:54,820
 [LAUGHTER]

251
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:58,820
 So yeah, so this is a study that was written by a man

252
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:01,820
 called Graham Donald who previously survived the loop in a plane.

253
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:02,820
 No, I'm joking.

254
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:03,820
 I'm joking.

255
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:04,820
 This is real.

256
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:05,820
 This is real.

257
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:06,820
 The other thing was real.

258
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:08,820
 I don't know why.

259
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:10,820
 The other thing was real.

260
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:11,820
 So this is a new study.

261
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:15,820
 This is that people who think that they have superior knowledge,

262
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:19,820
 both knowledge, belief, facts, they tend to overestimate how much

263
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:20,820
 they actually know.

264
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:22,820
 And then-- so they did this as a study.

265
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:25,820
 It's in a paper that's called, is belief superiority justified

266
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:26,820
 by superior knowledge.

267
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:29,820
 They sent people down and they asked them what they knew.

268
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:32,820
 And then they did a test to actually test if they knew what they thought they knew.

269
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:34,820
 And it turns out they don't.

270
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:35,820
 [LAUGHTER]

271
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:36,820
 Yeah.

272
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:38,820
 But even when they were told that they were wrong,

273
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:40,820
 they still believe that they knew more than most people, didn't they?

274
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:40,820
 Yeah.

275
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:43,820
 And this was all about political facts.

276
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:44,820
 Yes, exactly.

277
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:49,820
 So if they have political biases, then they'll just assume they know facts.

278
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:50,820
 They were like, objectively, I'm right.

279
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:51,820
 Yeah.

280
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:56,820
 And these people were also found to, whenever they want to read about a subject,

281
00:14:56,820 --> 00:15:00,820
 they always read papers that agreed with whatever their viewpoint was.

282
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:03,820
 And they also did it knowing that they were doing that.

283
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:04,820
 So no, this is fine.

284
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:05,820
 This is what I'm meant to do.

285
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:06,820
 So that's what the study was about.

286
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:07,820
 I know.

287
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:09,820
 I'm relating to so much of what you just said.

288
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:11,820
 [LAUGHTER]

289
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:17,820
 But I think they have even been studies done before that show that the more expert you are in something,

290
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:22,820
 the more you'll lie about how much you know about it.

291
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:27,820
 So basically, there was a study in 2015 that found that you're likely to over-claim

292
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:28,820
 if you're good at something.

293
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:31,820
 So for instance, if you're a geographer, then you'll claim you know of a place

294
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:32,820
 that actually doesn't exist.

295
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:33,820
 And that literally happened.

296
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:38,820
 So a bunch of geographers by profession were given a list of geographic locations

297
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:41,820
 and told, you know, tell us if you're familiar with these places.

298
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:43,820
 And they said, yeah, Lake Othello, sure.

299
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:44,820
 Yeah, Kashmir and Oregon.

300
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:45,820
 Yeah, I know that place.

301
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:46,820
 It's my aunt lives there.

302
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:48,820
 And none of those places existed.

303
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:49,820
 [LAUGHTER]

304
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:51,820
 92% said, same with biologists.

305
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:57,820
 So biology experts were said, are you familiar with these toxins and chemicals?

306
00:15:57,820 --> 00:15:59,820
 And so they were asked, do you know about meta-toxins?

307
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:01,820
 Do you know about retroplex?

308
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:03,820
 And they just ticked all those boxes.

309
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:04,820
 They said, yeah, of course they do.

310
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:05,820
 I'm a biologist.

311
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:06,820
 All made up.

312
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:09,820
 That doesn't just happen with people who are experts in the field.

313
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:13,820
 So for example, in 2013, the TV host Jimmy Kimmel, who's a very famous guy,

314
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:15,820
 he carried out an experiment on this.

315
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:18,820
 And when I say he, I mean, someone in his production team.

316
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:19,820
 [LAUGHTER]

317
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:23,820
 But they went to Coachella, the American music festival, Urona.

318
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:24,820
 [LAUGHTER]

319
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:27,820
 And they filmed themselves asking people, have you heard of these bands?

320
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:29,820
 And are you looking forward to seeing them at Coachella?

321
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:31,820
 But they were a lot of made up bands.

322
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:33,820
 And it's amazing seeing people saying, oh, yeah, I've heard.

323
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:34,820
 I haven't heard their new stuff.

324
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:36,820
 But my friends have told me I have to see them.

325
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:41,820
 When the bands were called things like Dr. Shlomo and the GI Clinic,

326
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:44,820
 the obesity epidemic, I love that stuff.

327
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:48,820
 And my favorite, Shorty Jizzle and the Plumper Cracks.

328
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:52,820
 [LAUGHTER]

329
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:54,820
 I really like the idea that Jimmy Kimmel, actually,

330
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:56,820
 instead of working on his show and doing jokes,

331
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:59,820
 is like, can we get more scientific surveys going on?

332
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:00,820
 And I'll focus on them.

333
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:01,820
 You guys do the rest.

334
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:04,820
 Another psychological study.

335
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:07,820
 And are you all quite good at crosswords?

336
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:10,820
 And better than Dan, sure.

337
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:12,820
 James could have asked you anything that you were good at.

338
00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:14,820
 And that's still the answer.

339
00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:15,820
 [LAUGHTER]

340
00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:19,820
 So I'll give you some words and so see if you can guess what they are.

341
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:21,820
 This is a lot of horrible things to do.

342
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:23,820
 So it's four letters.

343
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:25,820
 W, blank, blank, H.

344
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:26,820
 W, blank, with.

345
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:27,820
 With.

346
00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:28,820
 With.

347
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:29,820
 Okay.

348
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:30,820
 I'll say wash.

349
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:31,820
 Okay.

350
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:33,820
 S, blank, blank, P.

351
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:34,820
 Soap.

352
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:35,820
 Stop.

353
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:36,820
 Okay.

354
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:37,820
 Well, this has worked quite well because--

355
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:39,820
 You know this isn't how crosswords work.

356
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:41,820
 [LAUGHTER]

357
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:43,820
 Well, here's the thing.

358
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:45,820
 Here's the thing, right?

359
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:48,820
 Apparently, anyone who says cleansing related words,

360
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:53,820
 like wash or soap, has done some extremely bad deeds

361
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:55,820
 in the most recent past.

362
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:57,820
 [LAUGHTER]

363
00:17:57,820 --> 00:17:59,820
 Wow.

364
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:02,820
 [APPLAUSE]

365
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:06,820
 I literally says instead of alternatives, such as with and stuff.

366
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:08,820
 It's okay.

367
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:12,820
 [LAUGHTER]

368
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:16,820
 I thought with, I just took wash because she's so with already.

369
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:17,820
 I didn't say soap first.

370
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:19,820
 I grant you that.

371
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:20,820
 [LAUGHTER]

372
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:21,820
 This is great.

373
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:23,820
 So I'm the normal, again, switch.

374
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:26,820
 You have that angelic one, and this is the evil bastard.

375
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:28,820
 Oh, yes.

376
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:30,820
 [LAUGHTER]

377
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:34,820
 So there's a thing about when you're tricked by a fraudster.

378
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:36,820
 It turns out it's not the fraudster who's tricking you.

379
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:37,820
 It's you who's tricking you.

380
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:41,820
 You trick yourself into thinking this fraudster is plausible.

381
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:43,820
 [LAUGHTER]

382
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:44,820
 Okay.

383
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:47,820
 So in 2008, Stephen Greenspan, who's an author,

384
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:49,820
 he published a book called The Annals of Galability,

385
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:52,820
 which was the summary of decades of work of his

386
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:55,820
 about how not to be gullible, how not to be fooled.

387
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:58,820
 Two days after publication, he discovered that his financial advisor,

388
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:01,820
 one Mr. Bernie Madoff,

389
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:04,820
 [LAUGHTER]

390
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:07,820
 had defrauded him out of a third of his retirement savings.

391
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:08,820
 Whoa.

392
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:09,820
 I know.

393
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:10,820
 Yeah.

394
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:11,820
 But he--

395
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:12,820
 [LAUGHTER]

396
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:14,820
 I mean, he's glad that we're having a massive lap

397
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:15,820
 about that in Melbourne.

398
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:16,820
 [LAUGHTER]

399
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:17,820
 That is pretty funny.

400
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:18,820
 That was funny.

401
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:20,820
 But what he said is that-- well, he didn't say this,

402
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:22,820
 but the theory goes that Greenspan trusted Madoff.

403
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:24,820
 He made himself believe, no, this guy seems plausible.

404
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:26,820
 If I give him a bit of money, I'll get loads back.

405
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:28,820
 Okay.

406
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:32,820
 So this fact is about, basically, the Donning Krueger effect.

407
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:33,820
 Yeah.

408
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:34,820
 I'm sure we've mentioned before.

409
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:35,820
 It's semi well-known.

410
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:37,820
 People have low ability who are just crap at things,

411
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:38,820
 thinking they're really good at things.

412
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:40,820
 And the idea is that if you literally know almost nothing

413
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:43,820
 about something, you don't know the stuff that reveals to you

414
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:45,820
 how little you know.

415
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:48,820
 So a good example that really spoke to me was that,

416
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:50,820
 if you don't know the--

417
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:52,820
 I bet they all speak to you, Dan.

418
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:53,820
 [LAUGHTER]

419
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:57,820
 So if you're a bad at writing, and let's say you don't have

420
00:19:57,820 --> 00:20:01,820
 a good grasp of grammar and spelling,

421
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:03,820
 you won't know that you're a bad writer,

422
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:05,820
 because you don't know the rules in order to know

423
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:07,820
 that you're bad at those rules.

424
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:10,820
 Therefore, you think you're good without knowing.

425
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:11,820
 Yeah.

426
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:12,820
 Yeah, that is a good example.

427
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:14,820
 The example it was based on, though.

428
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:17,820
 [LAUGHTER]

429
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:19,820
 I'm actually going to edit that out,

430
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:21,820
 because it doesn't help us if you say

431
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:24,820
 smart things on this podcast.

432
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:25,820
 [LAUGHTER]

433
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:28,820
 You've got a personality to keep up here, Dan.

434
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:30,820
 So the example-- I didn't know the example

435
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:32,820
 on which Dunning Krueger, in fact, was based.

436
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:36,820
 So it was Dr. Dunning, who came across this incident.

437
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:38,820
 David Dunning came across this incident.

438
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:42,820
 In 1995, I think, it was a man who robbed banks in Pittsburgh.

439
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:44,820
 And he was caught on security cameras.

440
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:46,820
 So he went in broad daylight.

441
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:48,820
 He didn't have a mask on or anything.

442
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:51,820
 A court on security cameras arrested, and when he was interviewed,

443
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:53,820
 he said, but I wore the juice.

444
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:55,820
 And it turned out he'd rub lemon juice on his face.

445
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:58,820
 And he thought, because that works as invisible ink,

446
00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:03,820
 that that would render his face invisible to security cameras.

447
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:04,820
 [LAUGHTER]

448
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:06,820
 That is a brilliant trick to play on someone, isn't it?

449
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:08,820
 To tell them that, even better if you tell them

450
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:11,820
 that human seamen was used as invisible ink in the wall.

451
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:13,820
 Right.

452
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:14,820
 Which it was.

453
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:15,820
 Which it was.

454
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:18,820
 Otherwise, that would have been extremely weird thing for me to say.

455
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:20,820
 [LAUGHTER]

456
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:23,820
 But again, human seamen on your face does not render it invisible

457
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:26,820
 to security cameras, just to be clear.

458
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:28,820
 Oh, dear, do we get--

459
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:32,820
 It makes you quite conspicuous, actually.

460
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:35,820
 It'd be so weird at a lot of the end of ports.

461
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:36,820
 Where's she gone?

462
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:37,820
 Like, it would be.

463
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:38,820
 [LAUGHTER]

464
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:43,820
 [APPLAUSE]

465
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:46,820
 We need to move on in a second, actually.

466
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:49,820
 We need to move on five minutes ago, then.

467
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:52,820
 Anything before we do?

468
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:54,820
 Just one little thing.

469
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:56,820
 British-- there's a thing called the better-than-average effect,

470
00:21:56,820 --> 00:21:58,820
 where you'll have heard lots of people.

471
00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:01,820
 Most people consider themselves better-than-average drivers.

472
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:04,820
 There was a study on British prisoners,

473
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:07,820
 which found that they rate themselves as more ethical

474
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:10,820
 and more moral than British people who are not in prison.

475
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:13,820
 [LAUGHTER]

476
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:15,820
 They also think they're more kind, moral, trustworthy, honest,

477
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:18,820
 dependable, generous, law-abiding, self-controlled,

478
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:20,820
 and generous.

479
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:22,820
 The only category they didn't think they were better-than-average on

480
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:24,820
 was law-abidingness.

481
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:25,820
 [LAUGHTER]

482
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:27,820
 And even then, they considered themselves

483
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:29,820
 average with everyone else.

484
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:31,820
 [LAUGHTER]

485
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:34,820
 OK, it is time for fact number three.

486
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:36,820
 And that is Chazinsky.

487
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:40,820
 Yep, my fact is that in the first major battle of World War I,

488
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:43,820
 the soldiers arrived by taxi.

489
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:45,820
 [LAUGHTER]

490
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:48,820
 And the taxi drivers duly charged the government

491
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:51,820
 70,000 and 12 francs for the journey.

492
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:52,820
 [LAUGHTER]

493
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:54,820
 Well, the incentive to get soldiers to jump out of the taxi

494
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:57,820
 is very quickly, because the last guy would have to pay.

495
00:22:57,820 --> 00:22:58,820
 [LAUGHTER]

496
00:22:58,820 --> 00:22:59,820
 Is that what you do?

497
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:01,820
 I never noticed it, but come to think of it.

498
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:03,820
 Well, I think we're learning where these words wash

499
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:06,820
 and soak up from Andy.

500
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:10,820
 And this is the amazing story of the Battle of the Man, which

501
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:12,820
 was a massive turning point in the First World War.

502
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:16,820
 It was September 1914, first major battle on the Western front.

503
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:19,820
 And the Germans were getting dangerously close to Paris.

504
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:23,820
 But that did mean that they could deploy all the Paris taxi drivers.

505
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:27,820
 And so the prison government sent 3,000 soldiers by taxi

506
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:30,820
 from Paris to the front, the war front, in 600 cabs.

507
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:32,820
 And everyone carried five soldiers.

508
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:35,820
 So a bit of a squash, because that's four squashed up in the back

509
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:38,820
 and then one in the front, who has to make awkward conversation

510
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:40,820
 with the driver all the way there.

511
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:42,820
 [LAUGHTER]

512
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:45,820
 So what are you saying that later on there in the trenches going,

513
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:47,820
 well, it's bad here, but it's not as bad as the squash taxi

514
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:49,820
 that we had to get here in.

515
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:51,820
 And it must have looked quite bizarre,

516
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:53,820
 because they weren't allowed to have their lights on,

517
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:55,820
 except the taxi at the very front.

518
00:23:55,820 --> 00:23:57,820
 And everyone else just had to follow the back lights,

519
00:23:57,820 --> 00:23:59,820
 the back red lights so they couldn't be spotted.

520
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:01,820
 But yeah, this is how they got to the front.

521
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:03,820
 It was a turning point, and the Allies won it.

522
00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:06,820
 And happy news, the war then went on for another four years.

523
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:09,820
 So the account of it on Wikipedia just reports

524
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:11,820
 that the Germans were surprised.

525
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:15,820
 [LAUGHTER]

526
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:18,820
 It's a very important element of war.

527
00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:19,820
 They did.

528
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:21,820
 I do love that they got charged for it.

529
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:23,820
 Taxi drivers, however much they want to do their duty

530
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:24,820
 for their country.

531
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:26,820
 In the end, you have deprived them of a couple of fares.

532
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:28,820
 So yeah, 70,000 francs.

533
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:30,820
 It's actually a big, steep journey.

534
00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:31,820
 Yeah, it is.

535
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:33,820
 London used to send in double-decker buses

536
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:35,820
 during the war effort as well.

537
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:38,820
 And that was amazing, because those are big buses.

538
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:41,820
 Not the modern ones, obviously, the old classics.

539
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:43,820
 And they were going down these country roads,

540
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:46,820
 which obviously weren't built to take these double-decker buses.

541
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:48,820
 So what would often happen is they would come across

542
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:51,820
 another double-decker bus from another ally coming the other way,

543
00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:53,820
 trying to get past each other, but tip over.

544
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:55,820
 And so the roads were littered,

545
00:24:55,820 --> 00:24:59,820
 would tip over buses that they couldn't get back up to function.

546
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:01,820
 Were they littered?

547
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:07,820
 Was it like, you know, you can't stretch your arms out on this road

548
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:09,820
 without bumping into a double-decker bus?

549
00:25:09,820 --> 00:25:11,820
 It's just some of those ones actually,

550
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:13,820
 because they were used for lots of different things.

551
00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:15,820
 They were used as ambulances and for transport,

552
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:16,820
 the London buses.

553
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:18,820
 And some of them were used to carry pigeons.

554
00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:20,820
 To carry, carry pigeons.

555
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:21,820
 To carry, carry pigeons.

556
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:24,820
 And they had special pigeon lofts built on the top of them.

557
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:27,820
 So they're really cool pictures of these double-decker buses

558
00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:30,820
 with a pigeon loft kind of house built on top of it.

559
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:31,820
 It brought them over.

560
00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:32,820
 It's amazing.

561
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:33,820
 You think the pigeons could just fly over?

562
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:34,820
 You just thought.

563
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:36,820
 But they were actually all conscientious objectors,

564
00:25:36,820 --> 00:25:38,820
 so they really had to be forced.

565
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:41,820
 [LAUGHTER]

566
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:42,820
 Sorry.

567
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:44,820
 I have some stuff on taxis.

568
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:45,820
 Yeah, OK, yeah.

569
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:50,820
 So in the UK, it's illegal to get into a taxi if you have plague.

570
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:52,820
 [LAUGHTER]

571
00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:54,820
 Unless you tell the taxi driver.

572
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:55,820
 [LAUGHTER]

573
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:58,820
 So you're not allowed to withhold it from him.

574
00:25:58,820 --> 00:26:01,820
 And this is actually-- there's all sorts of different diseases.

575
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:04,820
 This is according to the public health control of diseases

576
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:06,820
 act of 1985.

577
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:08,820
 So if you have the plague cholera,

578
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:11,820
 relapsing fever, smallpox, or typhus,

579
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:13,820
 then you have to tell the taxi driver.

580
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:16,820
 But also weirdly, food poisoning, you need to.

581
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:18,820
 And these are all, if you also,

582
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:21,820
 if you want to go to a library and get a book out,

583
00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:23,820
 and you have plague, you have to--

584
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:24,320
 Yes.

585
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:26,820
 --you have to tell the driver that you're going to the library.

586
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:27,820
 [LAUGHTER]

587
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:29,820
 It's none of his fucking business.

588
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:33,820
 [LAUGHTER]

589
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:36,820
 It is kind of his business where you're going.

590
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:39,820
 [LAUGHTER]

591
00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:43,820
 I've got a taxi story.

592
00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:47,820
 This is from 2015, and it's a story about a taxi in Britain.

593
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:49,820
 It was that in 2015, a group of friends

594
00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:53,820
 tricked a taxi driver out of a £140 fair

595
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:56,820
 by leaving a mannequin in a hat in the back seat.

596
00:26:56,820 --> 00:26:57,820
 [LAUGHTER]

597
00:26:57,820 --> 00:27:00,820
 And pretending it was their sleeping friends.

598
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:01,820
 Oh, really?

599
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:02,820
 I mean--

600
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:04,820
 They went from Brighton to London, which is about 50 miles.

601
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:05,820
 It's a very long journey.

602
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:06,820
 Lucky cabin.

603
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:08,820
 And they were like, oh, no, you need to take Derek here

604
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:09,820
 up to Manchester.

605
00:27:09,820 --> 00:27:10,820
 Oh, no.

606
00:27:10,820 --> 00:27:12,820
 And they just-- they got the two of them.

607
00:27:12,820 --> 00:27:14,820
 They got out, and they left the guy at the mannequin in the hat.

608
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:15,820
 And they said, our friends are asleep.

609
00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:16,820
 But what are you waking up?

610
00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:17,820
 Here's the address.

611
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:18,820
 And where did they send you to?

612
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:19,820
 That's what I want to know.

613
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:20,820
 It wasn't too far off.

614
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:22,820
 Yeah, because he might have worked it out right now.

615
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:23,820
 He might have worked it out.

616
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:27,820
 Do you know some other cars that drove from Brighton to London?

617
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:28,820
 Were.

618
00:27:28,820 --> 00:27:29,820
 [LAUGHTER]

619
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:31,820
 It was such a pointless link.

620
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:32,820
 It's about taxis.

621
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:37,820
 I mean, were the world's first fleet of electric taxis.

622
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:39,820
 And these were in 1897.

623
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:42,820
 So electric cars came along, and most cars were taxis then.

624
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:45,820
 And so in 1897, they wanted to show off.

625
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:47,820
 They were called hummingbirds, because they made the sound

626
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:49,820
 of a bird whenever they drove along.

627
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:52,820
 And they traveled at maximum 12 miles an hour,

628
00:27:52,820 --> 00:27:53,820
 usually more like nine.

629
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:57,820
 And as part of the unveiling, they did the London to Brighton journey,

630
00:27:57,820 --> 00:27:59,820
 which, as you say, is about 50 miles.

631
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:01,820
 Although they weren't actually able to complete the journey,

632
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:03,820
 and they had to do part of the race by train.

633
00:28:03,820 --> 00:28:06,820
 [LAUGHTER]

634
00:28:06,820 --> 00:28:09,820
 The other reason they were unpopular, the electric cars,

635
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:11,820
 was because they had electric lighting inside.

636
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:13,820
 And people didn't really like that,

637
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:16,820
 because people with a bashful disposition felt as conspicuous

638
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:19,820
 as if they were on the stage with the limelight on them.

639
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:21,820
 And so people didn't like having lights on them.

640
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:23,820
 So was the light on while they were driving?

641
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:25,820
 It was turning on you.

642
00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:26,820
 So the passengers.

643
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:27,820
 That's so weird.

644
00:28:27,820 --> 00:28:31,820
 OK, so the first taxis were sedan chairs, right, in London.

645
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:34,820
 And they were, well, all over.

646
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:37,820
 But they were very good, precisely for the opposite reason,

647
00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:39,820
 which was that there was no light on you at all,

648
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:40,820
 and you were surrounded by fabric.

649
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:42,820
 So it was extremely discreet.

650
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:45,820
 And the best thing was, they could go into your house

651
00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:46,820
 and up the stairs.

652
00:28:46,820 --> 00:28:48,820
 So if that's really awesome.

653
00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:49,820
 They were really good.

654
00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:51,820
 That's like getting an Uber and the guy carries you up to bed.

655
00:28:51,820 --> 00:28:56,820
 [LAUGHTER]

656
00:28:56,820 --> 00:28:58,820
 So they were faster than the carriages.

657
00:28:58,820 --> 00:28:59,820
 Lots of narrow stairways.

658
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:00,820
 Two guys carrying you up there.

659
00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:02,820
 And basically, if you were having an affair

660
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:04,820
 or you're trying to avoid a rest,

661
00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:06,820
 you just get into a sedan chair in your house

662
00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:07,820
 and say, take me to that house.

663
00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:08,820
 Second floor, please.

664
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:09,820
 And they'll do it.

665
00:29:09,820 --> 00:29:10,820
 What?

666
00:29:10,820 --> 00:29:11,820
 Yeah.

667
00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:15,820
 There's a connection, our mother's show, QI.

668
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:19,820
 Stephen Fry, his car, is a London black cab.

669
00:29:19,820 --> 00:29:22,820
 And it's fine now, because he lives in the countryside in Norfolk.

670
00:29:22,820 --> 00:29:23,820
 But he used to live in London.

671
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:26,820
 And most of his days were people just hopping into the back.

672
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:27,820
 [LAUGHTER]

673
00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:29,820
 And seeing Stephen Fry up there.

674
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:31,820
 Oh, yeah, Stephen Fry in the front of my car.

675
00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:34,820
 [LAUGHTER]

676
00:29:34,820 --> 00:29:35,820
 Prince Philip.

677
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:36,820
 Oh, Prince Philip.

678
00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:37,820
 And yours?

679
00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:40,820
 [LAUGHTER]

680
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:43,820
 That was a risky one, man.

681
00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:44,820
 [LAUGHTER]

682
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:47,820
 He had a private cab, but he only gave it up last year.

683
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:48,820
 Did he?

684
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:49,820
 Yeah.

685
00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:50,820
 Good, so.

686
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:53,820
 [LAUGHTER]

687
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:56,820
 You know, the first drunk driving incident was a taxi driver.

688
00:29:56,820 --> 00:29:58,820
 And this was also in 1897, actually.

689
00:29:58,820 --> 00:30:00,820
 This was a cab driver called George Smith

690
00:30:00,820 --> 00:30:02,820
 who drove his taxi straight into the side of a building

691
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:03,820
 and rode it off.

692
00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:05,820
 He was arrested for drunk driving.

693
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:06,820
 First person ever.

694
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:09,820
 And the police officers couldn't prove it.

695
00:30:09,820 --> 00:30:10,820
 But they knew he was drunk.

696
00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:11,820
 Because apparently he was acting drunk.

697
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:12,820
 And he said he was drunk.

698
00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:17,820
 But after that, they realized that they needed a test for it.

699
00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:19,820
 And that's where the breathalyzer came from.

700
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:20,820
 So they based the breathalyzer on that.

701
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:21,820
 And initially it was a balloon.

702
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:22,820
 And you blew into a balloon.

703
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:24,820
 And then you put the end of the balloon

704
00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:29,820
 over a bottle of chemicals, which changed from purple to yellow.

705
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:31,820
 And it didn't work very well.

706
00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:33,820
 Because there was no measure of how drunk you were.

707
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:35,820
 It just changed from purple to yellow.

708
00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:37,820
 And you went, I don't know how yellow is that.

709
00:30:37,820 --> 00:30:39,820
 Is that like yellow and is that bright enough yellow?

710
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:40,820
 Yeah, let's arrest him.

711
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:43,820
 We need to move on very soon.

712
00:30:43,820 --> 00:30:47,820
 Do you know where the word taxi comes from?

713
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:49,820
 No.

714
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:51,820
 Taxis.

715
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:54,820
 Arrangement means movement in Latin.

716
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:56,820
 Yeah, it comes from the word taxi meter.

717
00:30:56,820 --> 00:30:57,820
 Oh, okay.

718
00:30:57,820 --> 00:30:58,820
 Isn't that weird?

719
00:30:58,820 --> 00:31:01,820
 What was the taxi meter before a taxi then?

720
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:02,820
 It had a different name.

721
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:03,820
 But then someone invented the taxi meter

722
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:05,820
 and they were like, oh, that's a fantastic one.

723
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:06,820
 What are we going to put this in?

724
00:31:06,820 --> 00:31:07,820
 Yeah.

725
00:31:07,820 --> 00:31:15,820
 So they built a car around it.

726
00:31:15,820 --> 00:31:18,820
 Okay, we need to move on to our final fact of the show.

727
00:31:18,820 --> 00:31:20,820
 And that is James.

728
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:24,820
 Okay, my fact this week is that the Gulf Corvina fish

729
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:33,820
 has such loud sex that it can deafened dolphins.

730
00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:41,820
 That is, they shouldn't be listening to pervers.

731
00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:44,820
 So the Gulf Corvina is a Mexican fish.

732
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:48,820
 They have sex in huge orgies with lots of these fish.

733
00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:52,820
 And they have mating calls that sound like rapid sounding pulses

734
00:31:52,820 --> 00:31:53,820
 like a machine gun.

735
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:57,820
 And you get a whole load of them together because it's an orgie

736
00:31:57,820 --> 00:32:00,820
 and that's what happens, I believe, apologies.

737
00:32:00,820 --> 00:32:03,820
 And apparently it sounds like a crowd cheering at a football stadium

738
00:32:03,820 --> 00:32:06,820
 or a really, really loud beehive.

739
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:09,820
 And there was a guy who studies them called Timothy Rothwell

740
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:11,820
 and he said that the sound was literally so loud

741
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:13,820
 that he had to shout to talk to the rest of the team

742
00:32:13,820 --> 00:32:15,820
 when he was studying them.

743
00:32:15,820 --> 00:32:16,820
 And he's above water.

744
00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:18,820
 So you can still hear it there.

745
00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:19,820
 Yeah, it's incredible.

746
00:32:19,820 --> 00:32:21,820
 I listened to a sound file of it today.

747
00:32:21,820 --> 00:32:25,820
 And yeah, you could sound only I know, right?

748
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:30,820
 Mr. Allen, the good stuff.

749
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:33,820
 It does sound like a sort of...

750
00:32:33,820 --> 00:32:36,820
 Kind of like a machine gun sound that you were talking about.

751
00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:39,820
 I imagine, you know, in Australia when you press those buttons

752
00:32:39,820 --> 00:32:43,820
 to cross the streets and they just go, "Did you just like that?"

753
00:32:43,820 --> 00:32:45,820
 Yeah, that's actually...

754
00:32:45,820 --> 00:32:49,820
 Not many people know that that's the sound of it.

755
00:32:49,820 --> 00:32:51,820
 A little known fact.

756
00:32:51,820 --> 00:32:56,820
 And this kind of orgy thing, the frenzy thing that they do

757
00:32:56,820 --> 00:32:59,820
 basically sees all of the world's adult covenors

758
00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:02,820
 gathered in less than 1% of their usual home.

759
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:04,820
 So they all come from all different places.

760
00:33:04,820 --> 00:33:06,820
 They all come to this one place.

761
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:09,820
 So it's like everyone getting into one cupboard for the orgy.

762
00:33:09,820 --> 00:33:14,820
 Well, not really.

763
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:17,820
 It's less than 1% of their usual home.

764
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:20,820
 Yeah, but it's like that.

765
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:22,820
 But everyone in your home.

766
00:33:22,820 --> 00:33:25,820
 So it's just for you and your girlfriend, I guess.

767
00:33:25,820 --> 00:33:30,820
 Just like you and your girlfriend getting in a cupboard.

768
00:33:30,820 --> 00:33:33,820
 I worked out the numbers and it was a bit like...

769
00:33:33,820 --> 00:33:35,820
 It's a bit like everyone in London going to Disneyland

770
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:37,820
 once a year to have sex.

771
00:33:37,820 --> 00:33:38,820
 That that size.

772
00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:43,820
 And that I know is a contravention of parcels.

773
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:45,820
 I don't like it.

774
00:33:45,820 --> 00:33:48,820
 And how do you know that?

775
00:33:48,820 --> 00:33:53,820
 That's why you guys have to do it in the cupboard now, right?

776
00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:57,820
 Everyone knows it's Disneyland or a cupboard.

777
00:33:57,820 --> 00:33:59,820
 It's actually really inconvenient for these fish

778
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:00,820
 that they do this, right?

779
00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:01,820
 Yeah.

780
00:34:01,820 --> 00:34:03,820
 Because as you say, they all gather together to have sex.

781
00:34:03,820 --> 00:34:04,820
 And they're really tasty.

782
00:34:04,820 --> 00:34:05,820
 They're a delicacy.

783
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:08,820
 And fishermen go to where they gather to have sex.

784
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:10,820
 And then they make this huge noise

785
00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:12,820
 to really advertise exactly where they are.

786
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:14,820
 And so fishermen know exactly where to go to fish for them.

787
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:18,820
 Yeah, it's not the worst fish sex tactic.

788
00:34:18,820 --> 00:34:22,820
 So there is a fantastic book by Mara J. Hart.

789
00:34:22,820 --> 00:34:23,820
 It's called Sex in the Sea.

790
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:24,820
 I highly recommend it.

791
00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:26,820
 It's all about this sort of thing.

792
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:27,820
 I don't recommend it.

793
00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:29,820
 Now are you mind why I recommend it?

794
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:31,820
 All for that matter why I bought it.

795
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:37,820
 But it has information about fish.

796
00:34:37,820 --> 00:34:40,820
 You were very disappointed it was a non-fiction book.

797
00:34:40,820 --> 00:34:44,820
 Anyway, no, they're a fish called Grunnan.

798
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:47,820
 And they, to have sex, throw themselves onto land,

799
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:50,820
 which is very inconvenient because they are fish.

800
00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:53,820
 And the female has to dig a hole in the sand

801
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:57,820
 and then bury herself in the sand until there's only her head sticking out.

802
00:34:57,820 --> 00:34:58,820
 She starts laying eggs.

803
00:34:58,820 --> 00:35:01,820
 And then the male jumps on her and spoons her and her sex with her.

804
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:05,820
 And he uses her as a slide for his sperm,

805
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:06,820
 which lands on the eggs.

806
00:35:06,820 --> 00:35:09,820
 And then they have to try and catch a wave back.

807
00:35:09,820 --> 00:35:13,820
 It sounds like the most inconvenient mating ritual you could imagine.

808
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:16,820
 And yeah, she can't breathe through any of it.

809
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:17,820
 Right.

810
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:18,820
 So it's so unpleasant.

811
00:35:18,820 --> 00:35:20,820
 And they're all Jesus' well, aren't they?

812
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:24,820
 So often she's got a few males curved around her while suffocating to death,

813
00:35:24,820 --> 00:35:26,820
 while attempting to procreate.

814
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:28,820
 It's a very bad deal.

815
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:32,820
 We actually have it quite good, guys, but I can understand.

816
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:37,820
 I started reading about, so dolphins are going death off the back of these fish having sex.

817
00:35:37,820 --> 00:35:42,820
 And I was looking into dolphin sex to see what they...

818
00:35:42,820 --> 00:35:44,820
 And this is really cool.

819
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:51,820
 Did you watch "Flipper 3" in the course of your research?

820
00:35:51,820 --> 00:35:56,820
 So this is Australian scientists have found that dolphins,

821
00:35:56,820 --> 00:35:59,820
 they've observed them doing this new thing where they come to surface

822
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:03,820
 and they pull like a banana shape so their head goes up and their back goes up

823
00:36:03,820 --> 00:36:05,820
 and they sit there like a big banana.

824
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:08,820
 And that's apparently really attractive.

825
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:10,820
 And look at the banana.

826
00:36:10,820 --> 00:36:13,820
 And that's like a new mating thing that we've not noticed before.

827
00:36:13,820 --> 00:36:15,820
 This was last year that we discovered this.

828
00:36:15,820 --> 00:36:19,820
 And also what they do is these are humpback dolphins.

829
00:36:19,820 --> 00:36:24,820
 They dig down and they break off coral and they wear them on their nose as a little hat.

830
00:36:24,820 --> 00:36:25,820
 So they have a hat.

831
00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:26,820
 Yeah.

832
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:31,820
 And again, so the mid-banana move with coral on their nose

833
00:36:31,820 --> 00:36:35,820
 and people or other dolphins are looking at them.

834
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:36,820
 And sexy.

835
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:37,820
 Yeah, that's sex.

836
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:38,820
 Yeah.

837
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:43,820
 Although they like to avoid males sometimes, so dolphin females are often really hassled

838
00:36:43,820 --> 00:36:46,820
 by the males and kind of gang-banged.

839
00:36:46,820 --> 00:36:50,820
 And so they really will have lots of males chase them at the same time,

840
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:53,820
 try to have sex with them and they flip over in the water and they stick

841
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:56,820
 their reproductive parts out of the water and the males can't get them at all.

842
00:36:56,820 --> 00:36:57,820
 Really?

843
00:36:57,820 --> 00:36:58,820
 Yeah.

844
00:36:58,820 --> 00:37:05,820
 They also slap them in the face with their tails quite a lot when they're being chased.

845
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:06,820
 Yeah.

846
00:37:06,820 --> 00:37:10,820
 Sorry, I said coral sponges.

847
00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:12,820
 They put sponges on their nose.

848
00:37:12,820 --> 00:37:13,820
 Yeah.

849
00:37:13,820 --> 00:37:14,820
 Yeah.

850
00:37:14,820 --> 00:37:15,820
 That makes more sense to them.

851
00:37:15,820 --> 00:37:16,820
 Yeah.

852
00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:19,820
 There's, I was looking at some fish sounds.

853
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:20,820
 Oh yeah.

854
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:23,820
 Because underwater creatures have the most amazing ways of making noise.

855
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:25,820
 And it works completely differently underwater.

856
00:37:25,820 --> 00:37:29,820
 So clown fish make a chirping noise by gnashing their teeth.

857
00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:33,820
 They literally, the only way they can communicate is by snapping their teeth together.

858
00:37:33,820 --> 00:37:35,820
 They're oyster toad fish.

859
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:39,820
 They make a blur like a folk horn noise by contracting their swimming bladders.

860
00:37:39,820 --> 00:37:43,820
 And there's gurami which snap the tendons of their pectoral fins.

861
00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:47,820
 So they basically clap their fins together, I suppose, in order to communicate with each other.

862
00:37:47,820 --> 00:37:48,820
 That's cool.

863
00:37:48,820 --> 00:37:50,820
 But they can be super loud fish.

864
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:54,820
 They've, they have been known to keep people awake at night, haven't they?

865
00:37:54,820 --> 00:37:56,820
 I think we've covered various things in the past.

866
00:37:56,820 --> 00:38:00,820
 I think a lot of the facts here are going to keep me awake at night.

867
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:04,820
 But I think the problem was, is that Jacques Cousteau did a documentary, didn't he?

868
00:38:04,820 --> 00:38:06,820
 In 1956 called The Silent World.

869
00:38:06,820 --> 00:38:07,820
 Oh yeah.

870
00:38:07,820 --> 00:38:09,820
 And it was all about the underwater.

871
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:13,820
 But basically, his diving tanks masked all the sounds of the water.

872
00:38:13,820 --> 00:38:15,820
 So he was like, oh, it's so quiet in here.

873
00:38:15,820 --> 00:38:18,820
 And actually, that's just where his microphones were.

874
00:38:18,820 --> 00:38:20,820
 And so lots of people thought it was really quiet.

875
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:22,820
 But like you say, and it is loud as hell as well.

876
00:38:22,820 --> 00:38:24,820
 It's noisy, even though it doesn't really work very well with our ears.

877
00:38:24,820 --> 00:38:25,820
 Because I thought this was really interesting.

878
00:38:25,820 --> 00:38:29,820
 So sound waves, because they travel a different way in water, how they do an air.

879
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:30,820
 And we've got air in our ear.

880
00:38:30,820 --> 00:38:33,820
 That's why sound is messed up for us underwater.

881
00:38:33,820 --> 00:38:35,820
 But that's also why whales.

882
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:38,820
 You know, they have huge amounts of wax in there is.

883
00:38:38,820 --> 00:38:42,820
 So you see whales ear wax, it comes, you know, many, many inches long ear wax.

884
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:44,820
 And that's kind of the same density as water.

885
00:38:44,820 --> 00:38:47,820
 So that means that the sound waves can travel into there is.

886
00:38:47,820 --> 00:38:48,820
 And they'd be fine.

887
00:38:48,820 --> 00:38:53,820
 But it's assumed that if they came up onto the surface, they would be deaf in air.

888
00:38:53,820 --> 00:38:54,820
 Really?

889
00:38:54,820 --> 00:38:55,820
 Yeah.

890
00:38:55,820 --> 00:38:56,820
 That's how you make a fish deaf.

891
00:38:56,820 --> 00:39:00,820
 Just on sex sounds, peacocks have been observed on land.

892
00:39:00,820 --> 00:39:02,820
 As opposed, yeah.

893
00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:04,820
 Peacocks.

894
00:39:04,820 --> 00:39:07,820
 They do not thrive underwater.

895
00:39:07,820 --> 00:39:15,820
 So peacocks have been found to be doing a full sex sound in order to attract mates.

896
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:19,820
 So what will happen is while they're mating, they have this sound that they do,

897
00:39:19,820 --> 00:39:22,820
 which is, which they'll just go the whole way through.

898
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:23,820
 Do it now.

899
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:24,820
 Come on.

900
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:27,820
 I haven't, annoyingly could not find that audio file.

901
00:39:27,820 --> 00:39:29,820
 But they, so they make this sound.

902
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:32,820
 And then the thing is, it's a very loud sound that the male makes.

903
00:39:32,820 --> 00:39:37,820
 So while it's happening, other females in the area will hear it at a distance and go,

904
00:39:37,820 --> 00:39:40,820
 "Ooh, that sounds like a good guy to reproduce with."

905
00:39:40,820 --> 00:39:41,820
 Which is what they're trying to do.

906
00:39:41,820 --> 00:39:43,820
 So that's what they listen out for.

907
00:39:43,820 --> 00:39:51,820
 And if they, the reason that that's good, that sound is it means that someone has picked them as genetically good to reproduce.

908
00:39:51,820 --> 00:39:52,820
 And so that's very important.

909
00:39:52,820 --> 00:39:57,820
 So peacocks are not good at reproducing genetically, have worked out this trick.

910
00:39:57,820 --> 00:40:04,820
 Where if they just make the sound even though they're not having sex, female peacocks will hear them in the distance going, "Whoa, that guy must be awesome."

911
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:07,820
 And head over to do it.

912
00:40:07,820 --> 00:40:13,820
 We've discussed this before, I think. So a lot of animals do these fake calls.

913
00:40:13,820 --> 00:40:15,820
 But there are some where they can't do fake calls, isn't it?

914
00:40:15,820 --> 00:40:17,820
 And I reckon it's, is it Elans?

915
00:40:17,820 --> 00:40:19,820
 They click their knees or something like this.

916
00:40:19,820 --> 00:40:20,820
 Yes, they do.

917
00:40:20,820 --> 00:40:24,820
 And that is a thing which is attractive to women if they click their knees.

918
00:40:24,820 --> 00:40:26,820
 But only the big ones can make the noise.

919
00:40:26,820 --> 00:40:29,820
 And it's impossible for the small ones to fake it.

920
00:40:29,820 --> 00:40:31,820
 Yes, there's an honest signal.

921
00:40:31,820 --> 00:40:35,820
 Whereas the peacocks can just stand in their windows going, "Oh, wow!"

922
00:40:35,820 --> 00:40:39,820
 Oh, yeah!

923
00:40:39,820 --> 00:40:42,820
 What's that? Oh, yeah, I know I'm good.

924
00:40:42,820 --> 00:40:45,820
 What great! Wow!

925
00:40:45,820 --> 00:40:48,820
 Okay, that is it. That is all of our facts.
