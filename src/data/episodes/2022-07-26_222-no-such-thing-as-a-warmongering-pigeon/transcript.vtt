00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.420
 Hey guys, just a quick announcement before we start this week's show, which is that we have a special bit of news.

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:07.900
 We have released an audio cassette.

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:10.980
 Yes, that's right, but it's not your normal audio cassette.

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:20.080
 This is like a futuristic year 3000 cassette because in it, it contains not just your average 50 minutes that an audio cassette would.

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:22.960
 We have over 1,900 minutes on this.

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:27.260
 It's true. It's a USB audio cassette. It's amazing. It looks like an audio cassette.

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:32.640
 There's USB pops out and on it, it's got the complete second year of fish, which you may have noticed.

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.700
 We've taken down from the website and we've put it onto this cassette.

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:43.160
 Yeah, and it's also got a special filmed episode with never before seen, never again seen, but it's filmed.

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:51.000
 Yeah, that's right. We filmed it in our natural habitat, the QI office in Covent Garden, around the table that we started the whole podcast on.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:58.140
 I have to say, it's got for me, personally, my favorite fact that I found in all four years of doing the podcast. It's very exciting.

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.780
 It's a very good fact when you hear it.

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:04.460
 You won't believe fact number three. It's fact number four.

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:11.740
 But yeah, if you can get it by going to qi.com/casset, and I do encourage you just to go there, just to look at it.

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:20.200
 It's a thing of beauty. It's absolutely stunning. It's this retro item, you know? It's a proper cassette, the casing, the booklet, everything is there, and it's yellow.

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:27.660
 It is yellow. The actual cassette is yellow, so qi.com/casset. All right, on with the show. On with the show live from Melbourne, Australia.

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:48.580
 Hello, and welcome to another episode of no such thing as a fish, a weekly podcast this week coming to you from Melbourne!

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:57.820
 [Cheering and Applause]

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:12.820
 My name is Dan Schreiber, and I am sitting here with Anacizanski, Andrew Huntamari, and James Harkin, and once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days, and in no particular order, here we go.

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:16.420
 Starting with you, Andrew Huntamari.

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:23.440
 My fact is that there was a showman in the 1930s who's act consisted of repeatedly crashing his plane into the ground.

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:25.260
 [Laughter]

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.020
 This is such an amazing guy, so this fact...

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:28.980
 Oh, sorry, Andy, how do you repeatedly crash?

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.400
 Surely you can only crash a plane once into the ground?

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:38.260
 That's a very good point. He sequentially crashed separate planes into the ground. Let the record show.

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:48.600
 So, this fact was actually sent in to us. To me, by a guy called Cameron Dawkins, so Cameron, thank you very much for this, and I looked into him a bit more, the showman, not Cameron Dawkins.

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.600
 [Laughter]

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:52.140
 Do you not care about Cameron at all?

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:53.840
 I do. He said you were fat.

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:54.540
 That's true.

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:58.300
 All right, I've researched Cameron Dawkins' life. We're here to tell you some home truths.

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:00.280
 Andy, all the research we've done is on Cameron.

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:00.900
 Oh, no.

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:05.900
 [Laughter]

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:08.300
 Cameron was born in 1982.

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:13.300
 [Laughter]

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:17.600
 Okay. No, the guy's name, the showman's name, he was called Frank Freaks.

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:20.760
 What a cool name. He was from Tennessee, and his speciality.

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:25.640
 He was an aerial showman, so he did lots of stuff, so he did loop the loops, and he did all sorts of acrobatics with his plane.

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:34.840
 But his special trick was crashing planes into trees, lakes, pre-built houses, and sometimes just smashing them right into the ground.

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:39.300
 He would buy a very old clunky plane, so obviously planes were very, very basic in these days.

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:44.300
 He would buy a really old clunky plane, he would get it just air-worthy, and then he would crash it.

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:46.180
 Yeah, and he was very honest about his career.

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:51.540
 He said, "I admit, I fool the public. Everyone who goes out there will expect to see me get killed, but I won't."

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:52.780
 [Laughter]

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:55.780
 It's amazing. You can see footage of this online.

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:57.380
 There's all these old newsreels with this.

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:03.820
 See, Frank, as he is that kind of voice, and you see him go through houses, and there's one great clip

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:08.100
 where he misses the house because the plane actually goes out of control.

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:15.780
 He loses genuine control of it, and he plummets, and you see him plummet in the distance, and by pure coincidence, he plummeted onto a car.

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:21.980
 So everyone was just as happy, because he still hit a thing, apart from the guy driving the car, just like...

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:26.020
 And he was, yeah, he was badly hurt, but he, um...

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:29.660
 And we're definitely sure he wasn't just a very bad pilot.

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:36.060
 Oh, all the time. The whole time. His actors actually watched me stay flying.

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:44.020
 He was sponsored by Camel Cigarettes, as everyone in those days, so actually, if you Google him, and if you look at sort of old sources from the time,

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:48.100
 the only thing that mentions him are cigarette adverts, where he just...

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:52.260
 It's so weird adverts in those days in the '30s, because you'll get, like, a really long form piece.

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:56.900
 Paragraph after paragraph about his career, and then the closing line will be something like...

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:01.420
 And below you see him having performed this stunt, and ready to enjoy his favourite smoke, Camel's.

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:07.340
 And yeah, and there'll be little cartoons of him, where he'd say, "I always smoke Camel's, I could smoke as many as I want,

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:10.740
 and I feel fresh, never jittery, and never upset."

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:16.340
 Yes, yes, my job is dangerous, but I tell you what's even more dangerous, a lifetime of smoking.

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:17.820
 Camel Cigarettes.

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:25.220
 So, um, the civil aviation authority didn't like this guy, did they?

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:29.460
 Right. They kept trying to shut him down, and all he'd do was just move to a different state,

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:31.580
 where they couldn't get hold of him.

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:37.460
 And so, one time, he was flying in Florida, and he crashed his plane, and everyone thought he was really injured,

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:41.660
 so an ambulance came and put him in the ambulance, and then they drove off,

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:46.980
 and then they got to state lines, he jumped out, and then ran off, and then did a show in the next day and next day.

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:48.420
 That's so amazing.

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:50.220
 It was very popular back then, wasn't it?

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:51.660
 What do you do in these, like, tricks and stuff?

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:56.700
 Do it, yeah, particularly air flights and air stunts. It was basically, after the First World War,

00:05:56.700 --> 00:06:00.140
 there was this massive surplus of airplanes, and the government didn't know what to do with them.

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:02.180
 And so, they sold them for nothing.

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:06.540
 I think, actually, they would sell the petrol in the tank, and it came with a free plane, sometimes.

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:07.540
 Wow.

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:12.940
 And so, all these amateurs just bought up all these planes and became stuntmen, and it was a huge deal.

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:16.700
 And we've mentioned it before on the podcast, but what they used to do was a thing called barnstorming,

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:21.140
 where a group of them would go and fly over a town, and they would land in a field,

00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:24.620
 they would ask for permission to put on a massive show, and if they got the permission,

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:27.580
 they would drop leaflets out of the plane saying, "Come and watch our show."

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:33.500
 So, they traveled in a pack, they were a tour, like a flying circus that would come in and do their show.

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:37.780
 And then some people think that the barnstorming word comes from crashing into these barns,

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:40.740
 like this guy did, he crashed into pre-fat buildings, didn't he?

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:41.420
 Yeah.

00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:42.980
 Do you know his other act?

00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:49.180
 It was called the Casket of Death, and he would climb into a barrel, which would be reinforced,

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:53.100
 blow it up with dynamite, from inside, and then jump out.

00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:54.900
 Wow.

00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:56.380
 I don't know. He just looked...

00:06:56.380 --> 00:07:00.380
 What you're saying is that he's in the same place as a dynamite, they're both inside the barrel.

00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:01.380
 Yes.

00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:03.380
 I would have had at least the barrel in between me and the dynamite.

00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:06.380
 Well, that's why your circus act failed.

00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:10.380
 James safely blows up a barrel at a distance.

00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:12.380
 It's no peril.

00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:19.260
 There was another guy called the Salamander, and he would...

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:24.100
 He had a death slide, which it was like a bobsleigh, with a cradle of lit fireworks underneath him,

00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:28.900
 but he also did a trick where he poured a pile of gunpowder along his neck and arm to a pile in his hand,

00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:34.540
 and his assistant would set fire to the gunpowder in his collarbone and when he got to his hands, it would blow up.

00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:38.220
 But he only did it apparently on special occasions.

00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:42.220
 He only ever did it twice, didn't he?

00:07:43.220 --> 00:07:47.180
 But gunpowder based on, so I think, were quite a thing.

00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:50.500
 Again, because the war just happened, people were quite into blowing things up,

00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:55.460
 and in the '30s, in Germany, rocket cycling was quite a big deal,

00:07:55.460 --> 00:08:00.940
 and so this was tying big sticks of dynamite to a bike and then lighting it,

00:08:00.940 --> 00:08:02.620
 and then it propels you in your rocket.

00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:05.540
 There was a guy called Herr Richter, who was good at this, he...

00:08:05.540 --> 00:08:09.700
 There was another guy called Wiley-Coyote, who was good at it.

00:08:09.700 --> 00:08:16.020
 Yeah, he... So this guy, he tied 12 rockets to his bike and then he called it Rakentenrod,

00:08:16.020 --> 00:08:20.460
 and when he hit 55 miles an hour, the first time he did it, all they all exploded and he flew off

00:08:20.460 --> 00:08:24.900
 and traveled about 50 yards into a hedge, I think, but he kept it up.

00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:29.580
 It is weird, they used to, um, the Daredevil, it was a job that suddenly boomed

00:08:29.580 --> 00:08:31.940
 where people were answering adverts in the newspaper.

00:08:31.940 --> 00:08:36.980
 This is a genuine one from 1931, wanted single man, not over 25,

00:08:36.980 --> 00:08:42.020
 to drive automobile in head-on collision with another car.

00:08:42.020 --> 00:08:44.780
 Must crash with another car at 40 miles an hour

00:08:44.780 --> 00:08:48.900
 and give unconditional release in case of injury or death.

00:08:48.900 --> 00:08:52.620
 Name your lowest price.

00:08:52.620 --> 00:08:54.620
 And these are, like, if you picture the cars as well,

00:08:54.620 --> 00:08:57.380
 if you picture in your head just old cars of the olden days,

00:08:57.380 --> 00:09:00.740
 those are the ones that were flying over buses and they couldn't get much speed

00:09:00.740 --> 00:09:03.580
 and it's pretty extraordinary to look at all the photos at the time.

00:09:03.580 --> 00:09:06.140
 Yeah, they weren't that kind of flimsy, weren't they?

00:09:06.140 --> 00:09:09.940
 And then, because another thing they used to do was travel in a car,

00:09:09.940 --> 00:09:13.100
 a little bike with a side car, with a lion in it.

00:09:13.100 --> 00:09:16.500
 This was another popular thing and they actually had a name.

00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:20.100
 I think they were called lion drones, so they'd go round a velodrome,

00:09:20.100 --> 00:09:24.260
 but on a motorbike and there'd be, sometimes there'd be a lion in your side car.

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:27.500
 And then there was another one where you were riding around a velodrome

00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:30.740
 on your motorbike and a bunch of lions got released and chased you.

00:09:30.740 --> 00:09:35.140
 Wow, come up it and just charged after you.

00:09:35.140 --> 00:09:37.140
 This is entertainment, sounds great.

00:09:37.140 --> 00:09:39.140
 Yeah, that's cool.

00:09:39.140 --> 00:09:42.540
 The first person to do a loop, the loop in an aeroplane,

00:09:42.540 --> 00:09:48.540
 was a Soviet guy called Piotr Nesterov and he was immediately arrested

00:09:48.540 --> 00:09:51.740
 for risking government property.

00:09:51.740 --> 00:09:57.500
 And then, a few months later, there was a French guy who did it called Adolf Pegu

00:09:57.500 --> 00:10:01.140
 and he became world famous and then the Soviets went,

00:10:01.140 --> 00:10:03.500
 maybe he shouldn't have arrested that guy after all.

00:10:03.500 --> 00:10:06.500
 And they took him out of prison and he was promoted to staff captain

00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:07.700
 and awarded a medal.

00:10:07.700 --> 00:10:08.700
 Really?

00:10:08.700 --> 00:10:09.900
 Wow.

00:10:09.900 --> 00:10:11.300
 That's so funny.

00:10:11.300 --> 00:10:14.700
 Have you ever heard, obviously, jumping out of a moving plane is very dangerous?

00:10:14.700 --> 00:10:16.900
 Have you ever heard of jumping into a moving plane?

00:10:16.900 --> 00:10:17.900
 No.

00:10:17.900 --> 00:10:19.300
 This is a thing that some people do.

00:10:19.300 --> 00:10:23.500
 What, if you're really late for your flight?

00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:24.500
 I'm serious, this has been done.

00:10:24.500 --> 00:10:29.900
 It was first done in 1997 and then last year, 2017, two guys recreated it

00:10:29.900 --> 00:10:31.220
 at two French daredevils.

00:10:31.220 --> 00:10:35.220
 So what happens is, you jump out of the aircraft, you're wearing a wing suit,

00:10:35.220 --> 00:10:39.820
 you then fly until you've caught up with the aircraft, which is flying downwards,

00:10:39.820 --> 00:10:41.820
 and then you jump back into it.

00:10:41.820 --> 00:10:42.820
 Wow.

00:10:42.820 --> 00:10:43.820
 It's not as rare.

00:10:43.820 --> 00:10:45.820
 It is also one for special occasions, only guys.

00:10:45.820 --> 00:10:46.820
 Wow.

00:10:46.820 --> 00:10:47.820
 Well, check this story out.

00:10:47.820 --> 00:10:49.820
 I was reading about a guy called Graham Donald.

00:10:49.820 --> 00:10:54.820
 He was a pilot in 1917 and he was attempting for the first time in a plane

00:10:54.820 --> 00:10:56.820
 that's called a Soppwith camel.

00:10:56.820 --> 00:10:57.820
 Yeah.

00:10:57.820 --> 00:10:59.820
 So he was attempting his first loop, the loop.

00:10:59.820 --> 00:11:03.020
 He went up 6,000 feet and he got to the peak of his loop, the loop.

00:11:03.020 --> 00:11:07.820
 He was upside down and his belt snapped and he fell out.

00:11:07.820 --> 00:11:09.020
 He disappeared out of the plane.

00:11:09.020 --> 00:11:10.020
 Yeah.

00:11:10.020 --> 00:11:12.020
 Now, 55 years later, he tells a story.

00:11:12.020 --> 00:11:13.020
 Oh, it was.

00:11:13.020 --> 00:11:17.420
 I'm going to say 55 years later, he landed.

00:11:17.420 --> 00:11:18.920
 So, check this out.

00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:21.820
 He's upside down, the belt snapped and he falls out.

00:11:21.820 --> 00:11:23.420
 He plummets 5,000 feet.

00:11:23.420 --> 00:11:27.820
 But because he was in the middle of a loop, the loop maneuver, his plane came back down.

00:11:27.820 --> 00:11:28.820
 Oh, yeah.

00:11:28.820 --> 00:11:29.820
 No.

00:11:29.820 --> 00:11:30.820
 Yeah.

00:11:30.820 --> 00:11:31.820
 This is his story.

00:11:31.820 --> 00:11:34.820
 He landed on the wing of the plane with 2,000 feet to go.

00:11:34.820 --> 00:11:35.820
 He got it.

00:11:35.820 --> 00:11:36.820
 Yes.

00:11:36.820 --> 00:11:37.820
 OK.

00:11:37.820 --> 00:11:38.820
 There are 1,000 people here.

00:11:38.820 --> 00:11:39.820
 Does anyone believe that story?

00:11:39.820 --> 00:11:41.820
 Give us a chance.

00:11:41.820 --> 00:11:43.820
 Graham Donald.

00:11:43.820 --> 00:11:44.820
 Check him out.

00:11:44.820 --> 00:11:45.820
 1917.

00:11:45.820 --> 00:11:46.820
 A thousand.

00:11:46.820 --> 00:11:47.820
 But it doesn't matter if he said it.

00:11:47.820 --> 00:11:48.820
 He's obviously delusional.

00:11:48.820 --> 00:11:49.820
 A thousand percent not true.

00:11:49.820 --> 00:11:50.820
 No.

00:11:50.820 --> 00:11:51.820
 He's incredible.

00:11:51.820 --> 00:11:53.820
 He met it on the bottom of the loop.

00:11:53.820 --> 00:11:54.820
 On the wing.

00:11:54.820 --> 00:11:56.820
 It is literally incredible.

00:11:56.820 --> 00:11:59.820
 How did the plane know where to go?

00:11:59.820 --> 00:12:01.820
 Because he had it in the loop maneuver.

00:12:01.820 --> 00:12:02.820
 It was just following its path.

00:12:02.820 --> 00:12:03.820
 It was a natural path.

00:12:03.820 --> 00:12:05.820
 That's not how physics works.

00:12:05.820 --> 00:12:08.820
 It was just going to strike.

00:12:08.820 --> 00:12:10.820
 It got a tangent.

00:12:10.820 --> 00:12:16.820
 He said the first 2,000 feet passed very quickly and terra firmer looked damn firmer.

00:12:16.820 --> 00:12:20.820
 As I fell, I began to hear my faithful little camel somewhere nearby.

00:12:20.820 --> 00:12:22.820
 Suddenly, I fell back onto her.

00:12:22.820 --> 00:12:26.820
 Maybe he was talking about the cigarettes coming.

00:12:26.820 --> 00:12:28.820
 And he made a good landing.

00:12:28.820 --> 00:12:29.820
 He's a hero.

00:12:29.820 --> 00:12:33.820
 We're going to have to move on to our next facts.

00:12:33.820 --> 00:12:34.820
 All right.

00:12:34.820 --> 00:12:36.820
 Do you guys know?

00:12:36.820 --> 00:12:38.820
 Do you guys know Tommy Fitzpatrick?

00:12:38.820 --> 00:12:39.820
 No.

00:12:39.820 --> 00:12:41.820
 My favorite stunt man.

00:12:41.820 --> 00:12:44.820
 In 1956, he was really drunk in a pub in New York.

00:12:44.820 --> 00:12:46.820
 He made a bet with his friend there.

00:12:46.820 --> 00:12:49.820
 That in 15 minutes, he'll be back at that pub in an aeroplane.

00:12:49.820 --> 00:12:53.820
 And then he went to an airport in New Jersey.

00:12:53.820 --> 00:12:54.820
 He stole a plane.

00:12:54.820 --> 00:12:57.820
 He landed it on St Nicholas Avenue in Manhattan.

00:12:57.820 --> 00:12:59.820
 Between a whole bunch of cars.

00:12:59.820 --> 00:13:02.820
 And in complete darkness, no lights on the plane, nothing.

00:13:02.820 --> 00:13:04.820
 And he rocked up back in the bar.

00:13:04.820 --> 00:13:06.820
 And he said, hey guys, I did it.

00:13:06.820 --> 00:13:08.820
 I suspect it took him longer than 15 minutes.

00:13:08.820 --> 00:13:10.820
 He was charged with grand lasty.

00:13:10.820 --> 00:13:12.820
 But the owner of the plane didn't press charges.

00:13:12.820 --> 00:13:13.820
 So he got away with it.

00:13:13.820 --> 00:13:17.820
 And two years later, he was in the same bar telling the story.

00:13:17.820 --> 00:13:19.820
 And the person he was telling didn't believe him.

00:13:19.820 --> 00:13:21.820
 So he did the exact same thing again.

00:13:21.820 --> 00:13:23.820
 [LAUGHTER]

00:13:23.820 --> 00:13:28.820
 OK.

00:13:28.820 --> 00:13:30.820
 It is time for fact number two.

00:13:30.820 --> 00:13:31.820
 And that is my fact.

00:13:31.820 --> 00:13:35.820
 My fact this week is that a new scientific study has shown

00:13:35.820 --> 00:13:38.820
 that people who claim to know a lot of facts don't actually

00:13:38.820 --> 00:13:40.820
 know as many facts as they think they do.

00:13:40.820 --> 00:13:43.820
 [LAUGHTER]

00:13:43.820 --> 00:13:45.820
 Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

00:13:45.820 --> 00:13:48.820
 What does it say about people who don't know that many facts?

00:13:48.820 --> 00:13:51.820
 And that the few facts that they do say are often described as dubious.

00:13:51.820 --> 00:13:54.820
 [LAUGHTER]

00:13:54.820 --> 00:13:58.820
 So yeah, so this is a study that was written by a man

00:13:58.820 --> 00:14:01.820
 called Graham Donald who previously survived the loop in a plane.

00:14:01.820 --> 00:14:02.820
 No, I'm joking.

00:14:02.820 --> 00:14:03.820
 I'm joking.

00:14:03.820 --> 00:14:04.820
 This is real.

00:14:04.820 --> 00:14:05.820
 This is real.

00:14:05.820 --> 00:14:06.820
 The other thing was real.

00:14:06.820 --> 00:14:08.820
 I don't know why.

00:14:08.820 --> 00:14:10.820
 The other thing was real.

00:14:10.820 --> 00:14:11.820
 So this is a new study.

00:14:11.820 --> 00:14:15.820
 This is that people who think that they have superior knowledge,

00:14:15.820 --> 00:14:19.820
 both knowledge, belief, facts, they tend to overestimate how much

00:14:19.820 --> 00:14:20.820
 they actually know.

00:14:20.820 --> 00:14:22.820
 And then-- so they did this as a study.

00:14:22.820 --> 00:14:25.820
 It's in a paper that's called, is belief superiority justified

00:14:25.820 --> 00:14:26.820
 by superior knowledge.

00:14:26.820 --> 00:14:29.820
 They sent people down and they asked them what they knew.

00:14:29.820 --> 00:14:32.820
 And then they did a test to actually test if they knew what they thought they knew.

00:14:32.820 --> 00:14:34.820
 And it turns out they don't.

00:14:34.820 --> 00:14:35.820
 [LAUGHTER]

00:14:35.820 --> 00:14:36.820
 Yeah.

00:14:36.820 --> 00:14:38.820
 But even when they were told that they were wrong,

00:14:38.820 --> 00:14:40.820
 they still believe that they knew more than most people, didn't they?

00:14:40.820 --> 00:14:40.820
 Yeah.

00:14:40.820 --> 00:14:43.820
 And this was all about political facts.

00:14:43.820 --> 00:14:44.820
 Yes, exactly.

00:14:44.820 --> 00:14:49.820
 So if they have political biases, then they'll just assume they know facts.

00:14:49.820 --> 00:14:50.820
 They were like, objectively, I'm right.

00:14:50.820 --> 00:14:51.820
 Yeah.

00:14:51.820 --> 00:14:56.820
 And these people were also found to, whenever they want to read about a subject,

00:14:56.820 --> 00:15:00.820
 they always read papers that agreed with whatever their viewpoint was.

00:15:00.820 --> 00:15:03.820
 And they also did it knowing that they were doing that.

00:15:03.820 --> 00:15:04.820
 So no, this is fine.

00:15:04.820 --> 00:15:05.820
 This is what I'm meant to do.

00:15:05.820 --> 00:15:06.820
 So that's what the study was about.

00:15:06.820 --> 00:15:07.820
 I know.

00:15:07.820 --> 00:15:09.820
 I'm relating to so much of what you just said.

00:15:09.820 --> 00:15:11.820
 [LAUGHTER]

00:15:11.820 --> 00:15:17.820
 But I think they have even been studies done before that show that the more expert you are in something,

00:15:17.820 --> 00:15:22.820
 the more you'll lie about how much you know about it.

00:15:22.820 --> 00:15:27.820
 So basically, there was a study in 2015 that found that you're likely to over-claim

00:15:27.820 --> 00:15:28.820
 if you're good at something.

00:15:28.820 --> 00:15:31.820
 So for instance, if you're a geographer, then you'll claim you know of a place

00:15:31.820 --> 00:15:32.820
 that actually doesn't exist.

00:15:32.820 --> 00:15:33.820
 And that literally happened.

00:15:33.820 --> 00:15:38.820
 So a bunch of geographers by profession were given a list of geographic locations

00:15:38.820 --> 00:15:41.820
 and told, you know, tell us if you're familiar with these places.

00:15:41.820 --> 00:15:43.820
 And they said, yeah, Lake Othello, sure.

00:15:43.820 --> 00:15:44.820
 Yeah, Kashmir and Oregon.

00:15:44.820 --> 00:15:45.820
 Yeah, I know that place.

00:15:45.820 --> 00:15:46.820
 It's my aunt lives there.

00:15:46.820 --> 00:15:48.820
 And none of those places existed.

00:15:48.820 --> 00:15:49.820
 [LAUGHTER]

00:15:49.820 --> 00:15:51.820
 92% said, same with biologists.

00:15:51.820 --> 00:15:57.820
 So biology experts were said, are you familiar with these toxins and chemicals?

00:15:57.820 --> 00:15:59.820
 And so they were asked, do you know about meta-toxins?

00:15:59.820 --> 00:16:01.820
 Do you know about retroplex?

00:16:01.820 --> 00:16:03.820
 And they just ticked all those boxes.

00:16:03.820 --> 00:16:04.820
 They said, yeah, of course they do.

00:16:04.820 --> 00:16:05.820
 I'm a biologist.

00:16:05.820 --> 00:16:06.820
 All made up.

00:16:06.820 --> 00:16:09.820
 That doesn't just happen with people who are experts in the field.

00:16:09.820 --> 00:16:13.820
 So for example, in 2013, the TV host Jimmy Kimmel, who's a very famous guy,

00:16:13.820 --> 00:16:15.820
 he carried out an experiment on this.

00:16:15.820 --> 00:16:18.820
 And when I say he, I mean, someone in his production team.

00:16:18.820 --> 00:16:19.820
 [LAUGHTER]

00:16:19.820 --> 00:16:23.820
 But they went to Coachella, the American music festival, Urona.

00:16:23.820 --> 00:16:24.820
 [LAUGHTER]

00:16:24.820 --> 00:16:27.820
 And they filmed themselves asking people, have you heard of these bands?

00:16:27.820 --> 00:16:29.820
 And are you looking forward to seeing them at Coachella?

00:16:29.820 --> 00:16:31.820
 But they were a lot of made up bands.

00:16:31.820 --> 00:16:33.820
 And it's amazing seeing people saying, oh, yeah, I've heard.

00:16:33.820 --> 00:16:34.820
 I haven't heard their new stuff.

00:16:34.820 --> 00:16:36.820
 But my friends have told me I have to see them.

00:16:36.820 --> 00:16:41.820
 When the bands were called things like Dr. Shlomo and the GI Clinic,

00:16:41.820 --> 00:16:44.820
 the obesity epidemic, I love that stuff.

00:16:44.820 --> 00:16:48.820
 And my favorite, Shorty Jizzle and the Plumper Cracks.

00:16:48.820 --> 00:16:52.820
 [LAUGHTER]

00:16:52.820 --> 00:16:54.820
 I really like the idea that Jimmy Kimmel, actually,

00:16:54.820 --> 00:16:56.820
 instead of working on his show and doing jokes,

00:16:56.820 --> 00:16:59.820
 is like, can we get more scientific surveys going on?

00:16:59.820 --> 00:17:00.820
 And I'll focus on them.

00:17:00.820 --> 00:17:01.820
 You guys do the rest.

00:17:01.820 --> 00:17:04.820
 Another psychological study.

00:17:04.820 --> 00:17:07.820
 And are you all quite good at crosswords?

00:17:07.820 --> 00:17:10.820
 And better than Dan, sure.

00:17:10.820 --> 00:17:12.820
 James could have asked you anything that you were good at.

00:17:12.820 --> 00:17:14.820
 And that's still the answer.

00:17:14.820 --> 00:17:15.820
 [LAUGHTER]

00:17:15.820 --> 00:17:19.820
 So I'll give you some words and so see if you can guess what they are.

00:17:19.820 --> 00:17:21.820
 This is a lot of horrible things to do.

00:17:21.820 --> 00:17:23.820
 So it's four letters.

00:17:23.820 --> 00:17:25.820
 W, blank, blank, H.

00:17:25.820 --> 00:17:26.820
 W, blank, with.

00:17:26.820 --> 00:17:27.820
 With.

00:17:27.820 --> 00:17:28.820
 With.

00:17:28.820 --> 00:17:29.820
 Okay.

00:17:29.820 --> 00:17:30.820
 I'll say wash.

00:17:30.820 --> 00:17:31.820
 Okay.

00:17:31.820 --> 00:17:33.820
 S, blank, blank, P.

00:17:33.820 --> 00:17:34.820
 Soap.

00:17:34.820 --> 00:17:35.820
 Stop.

00:17:35.820 --> 00:17:36.820
 Okay.

00:17:36.820 --> 00:17:37.820
 Well, this has worked quite well because--

00:17:37.820 --> 00:17:39.820
 You know this isn't how crosswords work.

00:17:39.820 --> 00:17:41.820
 [LAUGHTER]

00:17:41.820 --> 00:17:43.820
 Well, here's the thing.

00:17:43.820 --> 00:17:45.820
 Here's the thing, right?

00:17:45.820 --> 00:17:48.820
 Apparently, anyone who says cleansing related words,

00:17:48.820 --> 00:17:53.820
 like wash or soap, has done some extremely bad deeds

00:17:53.820 --> 00:17:55.820
 in the most recent past.

00:17:55.820 --> 00:17:57.820
 [LAUGHTER]

00:17:57.820 --> 00:17:59.820
 Wow.

00:17:59.820 --> 00:18:02.820
 [APPLAUSE]

00:18:02.820 --> 00:18:06.820
 I literally says instead of alternatives, such as with and stuff.

00:18:06.820 --> 00:18:08.820
 It's okay.

00:18:08.820 --> 00:18:12.820
 [LAUGHTER]

00:18:12.820 --> 00:18:16.820
 I thought with, I just took wash because she's so with already.

00:18:16.820 --> 00:18:17.820
 I didn't say soap first.

00:18:17.820 --> 00:18:19.820
 I grant you that.

00:18:19.820 --> 00:18:20.820
 [LAUGHTER]

00:18:20.820 --> 00:18:21.820
 This is great.

00:18:21.820 --> 00:18:23.820
 So I'm the normal, again, switch.

00:18:23.820 --> 00:18:26.820
 You have that angelic one, and this is the evil bastard.

00:18:26.820 --> 00:18:28.820
 Oh, yes.

00:18:28.820 --> 00:18:30.820
 [LAUGHTER]

00:18:30.820 --> 00:18:34.820
 So there's a thing about when you're tricked by a fraudster.

00:18:34.820 --> 00:18:36.820
 It turns out it's not the fraudster who's tricking you.

00:18:36.820 --> 00:18:37.820
 It's you who's tricking you.

00:18:37.820 --> 00:18:41.820
 You trick yourself into thinking this fraudster is plausible.

00:18:41.820 --> 00:18:43.820
 [LAUGHTER]

00:18:43.820 --> 00:18:44.820
 Okay.

00:18:44.820 --> 00:18:47.820
 So in 2008, Stephen Greenspan, who's an author,

00:18:47.820 --> 00:18:49.820
 he published a book called The Annals of Galability,

00:18:49.820 --> 00:18:52.820
 which was the summary of decades of work of his

00:18:52.820 --> 00:18:55.820
 about how not to be gullible, how not to be fooled.

00:18:55.820 --> 00:18:58.820
 Two days after publication, he discovered that his financial advisor,

00:18:58.820 --> 00:19:01.820
 one Mr. Bernie Madoff,

00:19:01.820 --> 00:19:04.820
 [LAUGHTER]

00:19:04.820 --> 00:19:07.820
 had defrauded him out of a third of his retirement savings.

00:19:07.820 --> 00:19:08.820
 Whoa.

00:19:08.820 --> 00:19:09.820
 I know.

00:19:09.820 --> 00:19:10.820
 Yeah.

00:19:10.820 --> 00:19:11.820
 But he--

00:19:11.820 --> 00:19:12.820
 [LAUGHTER]

00:19:12.820 --> 00:19:14.820
 I mean, he's glad that we're having a massive lap

00:19:14.820 --> 00:19:15.820
 about that in Melbourne.

00:19:15.820 --> 00:19:16.820
 [LAUGHTER]

00:19:16.820 --> 00:19:17.820
 That is pretty funny.

00:19:17.820 --> 00:19:18.820
 That was funny.

00:19:18.820 --> 00:19:20.820
 But what he said is that-- well, he didn't say this,

00:19:20.820 --> 00:19:22.820
 but the theory goes that Greenspan trusted Madoff.

00:19:22.820 --> 00:19:24.820
 He made himself believe, no, this guy seems plausible.

00:19:24.820 --> 00:19:26.820
 If I give him a bit of money, I'll get loads back.

00:19:26.820 --> 00:19:28.820
 Okay.

00:19:28.820 --> 00:19:32.820
 So this fact is about, basically, the Donning Krueger effect.

00:19:32.820 --> 00:19:33.820
 Yeah.

00:19:33.820 --> 00:19:34.820
 I'm sure we've mentioned before.

00:19:34.820 --> 00:19:35.820
 It's semi well-known.

00:19:35.820 --> 00:19:37.820
 People have low ability who are just crap at things,

00:19:37.820 --> 00:19:38.820
 thinking they're really good at things.

00:19:38.820 --> 00:19:40.820
 And the idea is that if you literally know almost nothing

00:19:40.820 --> 00:19:43.820
 about something, you don't know the stuff that reveals to you

00:19:43.820 --> 00:19:45.820
 how little you know.

00:19:45.820 --> 00:19:48.820
 So a good example that really spoke to me was that,

00:19:48.820 --> 00:19:50.820
 if you don't know the--

00:19:50.820 --> 00:19:52.820
 I bet they all speak to you, Dan.

00:19:52.820 --> 00:19:53.820
 [LAUGHTER]

00:19:53.820 --> 00:19:57.820
 So if you're a bad at writing, and let's say you don't have

00:19:57.820 --> 00:20:01.820
 a good grasp of grammar and spelling,

00:20:01.820 --> 00:20:03.820
 you won't know that you're a bad writer,

00:20:03.820 --> 00:20:05.820
 because you don't know the rules in order to know

00:20:05.820 --> 00:20:07.820
 that you're bad at those rules.

00:20:07.820 --> 00:20:10.820
 Therefore, you think you're good without knowing.

00:20:10.820 --> 00:20:11.820
 Yeah.

00:20:11.820 --> 00:20:12.820
 Yeah, that is a good example.

00:20:12.820 --> 00:20:14.820
 The example it was based on, though.

00:20:14.820 --> 00:20:17.820
 [LAUGHTER]

00:20:17.820 --> 00:20:19.820
 I'm actually going to edit that out,

00:20:19.820 --> 00:20:21.820
 because it doesn't help us if you say

00:20:21.820 --> 00:20:24.820
 smart things on this podcast.

00:20:24.820 --> 00:20:25.820
 [LAUGHTER]

00:20:25.820 --> 00:20:28.820
 You've got a personality to keep up here, Dan.

00:20:28.820 --> 00:20:30.820
 So the example-- I didn't know the example

00:20:30.820 --> 00:20:32.820
 on which Dunning Krueger, in fact, was based.

00:20:32.820 --> 00:20:36.820
 So it was Dr. Dunning, who came across this incident.

00:20:36.820 --> 00:20:38.820
 David Dunning came across this incident.

00:20:38.820 --> 00:20:42.820
 In 1995, I think, it was a man who robbed banks in Pittsburgh.

00:20:42.820 --> 00:20:44.820
 And he was caught on security cameras.

00:20:44.820 --> 00:20:46.820
 So he went in broad daylight.

00:20:46.820 --> 00:20:48.820
 He didn't have a mask on or anything.

00:20:48.820 --> 00:20:51.820
 A court on security cameras arrested, and when he was interviewed,

00:20:51.820 --> 00:20:53.820
 he said, but I wore the juice.

00:20:53.820 --> 00:20:55.820
 And it turned out he'd rub lemon juice on his face.

00:20:55.820 --> 00:20:58.820
 And he thought, because that works as invisible ink,

00:20:58.820 --> 00:21:03.820
 that that would render his face invisible to security cameras.

00:21:03.820 --> 00:21:04.820
 [LAUGHTER]

00:21:04.820 --> 00:21:06.820
 That is a brilliant trick to play on someone, isn't it?

00:21:06.820 --> 00:21:08.820
 To tell them that, even better if you tell them

00:21:08.820 --> 00:21:11.820
 that human seamen was used as invisible ink in the wall.

00:21:11.820 --> 00:21:13.820
 Right.

00:21:13.820 --> 00:21:14.820
 Which it was.

00:21:14.820 --> 00:21:15.820
 Which it was.

00:21:15.820 --> 00:21:18.820
 Otherwise, that would have been extremely weird thing for me to say.

00:21:18.820 --> 00:21:20.820
 [LAUGHTER]

00:21:20.820 --> 00:21:23.820
 But again, human seamen on your face does not render it invisible

00:21:23.820 --> 00:21:26.820
 to security cameras, just to be clear.

00:21:26.820 --> 00:21:28.820
 Oh, dear, do we get--

00:21:28.820 --> 00:21:32.820
 It makes you quite conspicuous, actually.

00:21:32.820 --> 00:21:35.820
 It'd be so weird at a lot of the end of ports.

00:21:35.820 --> 00:21:36.820
 Where's she gone?

00:21:36.820 --> 00:21:37.820
 Like, it would be.

00:21:37.820 --> 00:21:38.820
 [LAUGHTER]

00:21:38.820 --> 00:21:43.820
 [APPLAUSE]

00:21:43.820 --> 00:21:46.820
 We need to move on in a second, actually.

00:21:46.820 --> 00:21:49.820
 We need to move on five minutes ago, then.

00:21:49.820 --> 00:21:52.820
 Anything before we do?

00:21:52.820 --> 00:21:54.820
 Just one little thing.

00:21:54.820 --> 00:21:56.820
 British-- there's a thing called the better-than-average effect,

00:21:56.820 --> 00:21:58.820
 where you'll have heard lots of people.

00:21:58.820 --> 00:22:01.820
 Most people consider themselves better-than-average drivers.

00:22:01.820 --> 00:22:04.820
 There was a study on British prisoners,

00:22:04.820 --> 00:22:07.820
 which found that they rate themselves as more ethical

00:22:07.820 --> 00:22:10.820
 and more moral than British people who are not in prison.

00:22:10.820 --> 00:22:13.820
 [LAUGHTER]

00:22:13.820 --> 00:22:15.820
 They also think they're more kind, moral, trustworthy, honest,

00:22:15.820 --> 00:22:18.820
 dependable, generous, law-abiding, self-controlled,

00:22:18.820 --> 00:22:20.820
 and generous.

00:22:20.820 --> 00:22:22.820
 The only category they didn't think they were better-than-average on

00:22:22.820 --> 00:22:24.820
 was law-abidingness.

00:22:24.820 --> 00:22:25.820
 [LAUGHTER]

00:22:25.820 --> 00:22:27.820
 And even then, they considered themselves

00:22:27.820 --> 00:22:29.820
 average with everyone else.

00:22:29.820 --> 00:22:31.820
 [LAUGHTER]

00:22:31.820 --> 00:22:34.820
 OK, it is time for fact number three.

00:22:34.820 --> 00:22:36.820
 And that is Chazinsky.

00:22:36.820 --> 00:22:40.820
 Yep, my fact is that in the first major battle of World War I,

00:22:40.820 --> 00:22:43.820
 the soldiers arrived by taxi.

00:22:43.820 --> 00:22:45.820
 [LAUGHTER]

00:22:45.820 --> 00:22:48.820
 And the taxi drivers duly charged the government

00:22:48.820 --> 00:22:51.820
 70,000 and 12 francs for the journey.

00:22:51.820 --> 00:22:52.820
 [LAUGHTER]

00:22:52.820 --> 00:22:54.820
 Well, the incentive to get soldiers to jump out of the taxi

00:22:54.820 --> 00:22:57.820
 is very quickly, because the last guy would have to pay.

00:22:57.820 --> 00:22:58.820
 [LAUGHTER]

00:22:58.820 --> 00:22:59.820
 Is that what you do?

00:22:59.820 --> 00:23:01.820
 I never noticed it, but come to think of it.

00:23:01.820 --> 00:23:03.820
 Well, I think we're learning where these words wash

00:23:03.820 --> 00:23:06.820
 and soak up from Andy.

00:23:06.820 --> 00:23:10.820
 And this is the amazing story of the Battle of the Man, which

00:23:10.820 --> 00:23:12.820
 was a massive turning point in the First World War.

00:23:12.820 --> 00:23:16.820
 It was September 1914, first major battle on the Western front.

00:23:16.820 --> 00:23:19.820
 And the Germans were getting dangerously close to Paris.

00:23:19.820 --> 00:23:23.820
 But that did mean that they could deploy all the Paris taxi drivers.

00:23:23.820 --> 00:23:27.820
 And so the prison government sent 3,000 soldiers by taxi

00:23:27.820 --> 00:23:30.820
 from Paris to the front, the war front, in 600 cabs.

00:23:30.820 --> 00:23:32.820
 And everyone carried five soldiers.

00:23:32.820 --> 00:23:35.820
 So a bit of a squash, because that's four squashed up in the back

00:23:35.820 --> 00:23:38.820
 and then one in the front, who has to make awkward conversation

00:23:38.820 --> 00:23:40.820
 with the driver all the way there.

00:23:40.820 --> 00:23:42.820
 [LAUGHTER]

00:23:42.820 --> 00:23:45.820
 So what are you saying that later on there in the trenches going,

00:23:45.820 --> 00:23:47.820
 well, it's bad here, but it's not as bad as the squash taxi

00:23:47.820 --> 00:23:49.820
 that we had to get here in.

00:23:49.820 --> 00:23:51.820
 And it must have looked quite bizarre,

00:23:51.820 --> 00:23:53.820
 because they weren't allowed to have their lights on,

00:23:53.820 --> 00:23:55.820
 except the taxi at the very front.

00:23:55.820 --> 00:23:57.820
 And everyone else just had to follow the back lights,

00:23:57.820 --> 00:23:59.820
 the back red lights so they couldn't be spotted.

00:23:59.820 --> 00:24:01.820
 But yeah, this is how they got to the front.

00:24:01.820 --> 00:24:03.820
 It was a turning point, and the Allies won it.

00:24:03.820 --> 00:24:06.820
 And happy news, the war then went on for another four years.

00:24:06.820 --> 00:24:09.820
 So the account of it on Wikipedia just reports

00:24:09.820 --> 00:24:11.820
 that the Germans were surprised.

00:24:11.820 --> 00:24:15.820
 [LAUGHTER]

00:24:15.820 --> 00:24:18.820
 It's a very important element of war.

00:24:18.820 --> 00:24:19.820
 They did.

00:24:19.820 --> 00:24:21.820
 I do love that they got charged for it.

00:24:21.820 --> 00:24:23.820
 Taxi drivers, however much they want to do their duty

00:24:23.820 --> 00:24:24.820
 for their country.

00:24:24.820 --> 00:24:26.820
 In the end, you have deprived them of a couple of fares.

00:24:26.820 --> 00:24:28.820
 So yeah, 70,000 francs.

00:24:28.820 --> 00:24:30.820
 It's actually a big, steep journey.

00:24:30.820 --> 00:24:31.820
 Yeah, it is.

00:24:31.820 --> 00:24:33.820
 London used to send in double-decker buses

00:24:33.820 --> 00:24:35.820
 during the war effort as well.

00:24:35.820 --> 00:24:38.820
 And that was amazing, because those are big buses.

00:24:38.820 --> 00:24:41.820
 Not the modern ones, obviously, the old classics.

00:24:41.820 --> 00:24:43.820
 And they were going down these country roads,

00:24:43.820 --> 00:24:46.820
 which obviously weren't built to take these double-decker buses.

00:24:46.820 --> 00:24:48.820
 So what would often happen is they would come across

00:24:48.820 --> 00:24:51.820
 another double-decker bus from another ally coming the other way,

00:24:51.820 --> 00:24:53.820
 trying to get past each other, but tip over.

00:24:53.820 --> 00:24:55.820
 And so the roads were littered,

00:24:55.820 --> 00:24:59.820
 would tip over buses that they couldn't get back up to function.

00:24:59.820 --> 00:25:01.820
 Were they littered?

00:25:01.820 --> 00:25:07.820
 Was it like, you know, you can't stretch your arms out on this road

00:25:07.820 --> 00:25:09.820
 without bumping into a double-decker bus?

00:25:09.820 --> 00:25:11.820
 It's just some of those ones actually,

00:25:11.820 --> 00:25:13.820
 because they were used for lots of different things.

00:25:13.820 --> 00:25:15.820
 They were used as ambulances and for transport,

00:25:15.820 --> 00:25:16.820
 the London buses.

00:25:16.820 --> 00:25:18.820
 And some of them were used to carry pigeons.

00:25:18.820 --> 00:25:20.820
 To carry, carry pigeons.

00:25:20.820 --> 00:25:21.820
 To carry, carry pigeons.

00:25:21.820 --> 00:25:24.820
 And they had special pigeon lofts built on the top of them.

00:25:24.820 --> 00:25:27.820
 So they're really cool pictures of these double-decker buses

00:25:27.820 --> 00:25:30.820
 with a pigeon loft kind of house built on top of it.

00:25:30.820 --> 00:25:31.820
 It brought them over.

00:25:31.820 --> 00:25:32.820
 It's amazing.

00:25:32.820 --> 00:25:33.820
 You think the pigeons could just fly over?

00:25:33.820 --> 00:25:34.820
 You just thought.

00:25:34.820 --> 00:25:36.820
 But they were actually all conscientious objectors,

00:25:36.820 --> 00:25:38.820
 so they really had to be forced.

00:25:38.820 --> 00:25:41.820
 [LAUGHTER]

00:25:41.820 --> 00:25:42.820
 Sorry.

00:25:42.820 --> 00:25:44.820
 I have some stuff on taxis.

00:25:44.820 --> 00:25:45.820
 Yeah, OK, yeah.

00:25:45.820 --> 00:25:50.820
 So in the UK, it's illegal to get into a taxi if you have plague.

00:25:50.820 --> 00:25:52.820
 [LAUGHTER]

00:25:52.820 --> 00:25:54.820
 Unless you tell the taxi driver.

00:25:54.820 --> 00:25:55.820
 [LAUGHTER]

00:25:55.820 --> 00:25:58.820
 So you're not allowed to withhold it from him.

00:25:58.820 --> 00:26:01.820
 And this is actually-- there's all sorts of different diseases.

00:26:01.820 --> 00:26:04.820
 This is according to the public health control of diseases

00:26:04.820 --> 00:26:06.820
 act of 1985.

00:26:06.820 --> 00:26:08.820
 So if you have the plague cholera,

00:26:08.820 --> 00:26:11.820
 relapsing fever, smallpox, or typhus,

00:26:11.820 --> 00:26:13.820
 then you have to tell the taxi driver.

00:26:13.820 --> 00:26:16.820
 But also weirdly, food poisoning, you need to.

00:26:16.820 --> 00:26:18.820
 And these are all, if you also,

00:26:18.820 --> 00:26:21.820
 if you want to go to a library and get a book out,

00:26:21.820 --> 00:26:23.820
 and you have plague, you have to--

00:26:23.820 --> 00:26:24.320
 Yes.

00:26:24.320 --> 00:26:26.820
 --you have to tell the driver that you're going to the library.

00:26:26.820 --> 00:26:27.820
 [LAUGHTER]

00:26:27.820 --> 00:26:29.820
 It's none of his fucking business.

00:26:29.820 --> 00:26:33.820
 [LAUGHTER]

00:26:33.820 --> 00:26:36.820
 It is kind of his business where you're going.

00:26:36.820 --> 00:26:39.820
 [LAUGHTER]

00:26:39.820 --> 00:26:43.820
 I've got a taxi story.

00:26:43.820 --> 00:26:47.820
 This is from 2015, and it's a story about a taxi in Britain.

00:26:47.820 --> 00:26:49.820
 It was that in 2015, a group of friends

00:26:49.820 --> 00:26:53.820
 tricked a taxi driver out of a £140 fair

00:26:53.820 --> 00:26:56.820
 by leaving a mannequin in a hat in the back seat.

00:26:56.820 --> 00:26:57.820
 [LAUGHTER]

00:26:57.820 --> 00:27:00.820
 And pretending it was their sleeping friends.

00:27:00.820 --> 00:27:01.820
 Oh, really?

00:27:01.820 --> 00:27:02.820
 I mean--

00:27:02.820 --> 00:27:04.820
 They went from Brighton to London, which is about 50 miles.

00:27:04.820 --> 00:27:05.820
 It's a very long journey.

00:27:05.820 --> 00:27:06.820
 Lucky cabin.

00:27:06.820 --> 00:27:08.820
 And they were like, oh, no, you need to take Derek here

00:27:08.820 --> 00:27:09.820
 up to Manchester.

00:27:09.820 --> 00:27:10.820
 Oh, no.

00:27:10.820 --> 00:27:12.820
 And they just-- they got the two of them.

00:27:12.820 --> 00:27:14.820
 They got out, and they left the guy at the mannequin in the hat.

00:27:14.820 --> 00:27:15.820
 And they said, our friends are asleep.

00:27:15.820 --> 00:27:16.820
 But what are you waking up?

00:27:16.820 --> 00:27:17.820
 Here's the address.

00:27:17.820 --> 00:27:18.820
 And where did they send you to?

00:27:18.820 --> 00:27:19.820
 That's what I want to know.

00:27:19.820 --> 00:27:20.820
 It wasn't too far off.

00:27:20.820 --> 00:27:22.820
 Yeah, because he might have worked it out right now.

00:27:22.820 --> 00:27:23.820
 He might have worked it out.

00:27:23.820 --> 00:27:27.820
 Do you know some other cars that drove from Brighton to London?

00:27:27.820 --> 00:27:28.820
 Were.

00:27:28.820 --> 00:27:29.820
 [LAUGHTER]

00:27:29.820 --> 00:27:31.820
 It was such a pointless link.

00:27:31.820 --> 00:27:32.820
 It's about taxis.

00:27:32.820 --> 00:27:37.820
 I mean, were the world's first fleet of electric taxis.

00:27:37.820 --> 00:27:39.820
 And these were in 1897.

00:27:39.820 --> 00:27:42.820
 So electric cars came along, and most cars were taxis then.

00:27:42.820 --> 00:27:45.820
 And so in 1897, they wanted to show off.

00:27:45.820 --> 00:27:47.820
 They were called hummingbirds, because they made the sound

00:27:47.820 --> 00:27:49.820
 of a bird whenever they drove along.

00:27:49.820 --> 00:27:52.820
 And they traveled at maximum 12 miles an hour,

00:27:52.820 --> 00:27:53.820
 usually more like nine.

00:27:53.820 --> 00:27:57.820
 And as part of the unveiling, they did the London to Brighton journey,

00:27:57.820 --> 00:27:59.820
 which, as you say, is about 50 miles.

00:27:59.820 --> 00:28:01.820
 Although they weren't actually able to complete the journey,

00:28:01.820 --> 00:28:03.820
 and they had to do part of the race by train.

00:28:03.820 --> 00:28:06.820
 [LAUGHTER]

00:28:06.820 --> 00:28:09.820
 The other reason they were unpopular, the electric cars,

00:28:09.820 --> 00:28:11.820
 was because they had electric lighting inside.

00:28:11.820 --> 00:28:13.820
 And people didn't really like that,

00:28:13.820 --> 00:28:16.820
 because people with a bashful disposition felt as conspicuous

00:28:16.820 --> 00:28:19.820
 as if they were on the stage with the limelight on them.

00:28:19.820 --> 00:28:21.820
 And so people didn't like having lights on them.

00:28:21.820 --> 00:28:23.820
 So was the light on while they were driving?

00:28:23.820 --> 00:28:25.820
 It was turning on you.

00:28:25.820 --> 00:28:26.820
 So the passengers.

00:28:26.820 --> 00:28:27.820
 That's so weird.

00:28:27.820 --> 00:28:31.820
 OK, so the first taxis were sedan chairs, right, in London.

00:28:31.820 --> 00:28:34.820
 And they were, well, all over.

00:28:34.820 --> 00:28:37.820
 But they were very good, precisely for the opposite reason,

00:28:37.820 --> 00:28:39.820
 which was that there was no light on you at all,

00:28:39.820 --> 00:28:40.820
 and you were surrounded by fabric.

00:28:40.820 --> 00:28:42.820
 So it was extremely discreet.

00:28:42.820 --> 00:28:45.820
 And the best thing was, they could go into your house

00:28:45.820 --> 00:28:46.820
 and up the stairs.

00:28:46.820 --> 00:28:48.820
 So if that's really awesome.

00:28:48.820 --> 00:28:49.820
 They were really good.

00:28:49.820 --> 00:28:51.820
 That's like getting an Uber and the guy carries you up to bed.

00:28:51.820 --> 00:28:56.820
 [LAUGHTER]

00:28:56.820 --> 00:28:58.820
 So they were faster than the carriages.

00:28:58.820 --> 00:28:59.820
 Lots of narrow stairways.

00:28:59.820 --> 00:29:00.820
 Two guys carrying you up there.

00:29:00.820 --> 00:29:02.820
 And basically, if you were having an affair

00:29:02.820 --> 00:29:04.820
 or you're trying to avoid a rest,

00:29:04.820 --> 00:29:06.820
 you just get into a sedan chair in your house

00:29:06.820 --> 00:29:07.820
 and say, take me to that house.

00:29:07.820 --> 00:29:08.820
 Second floor, please.

00:29:08.820 --> 00:29:09.820
 And they'll do it.

00:29:09.820 --> 00:29:10.820
 What?

00:29:10.820 --> 00:29:11.820
 Yeah.

00:29:11.820 --> 00:29:15.820
 There's a connection, our mother's show, QI.

00:29:15.820 --> 00:29:19.820
 Stephen Fry, his car, is a London black cab.

00:29:19.820 --> 00:29:22.820
 And it's fine now, because he lives in the countryside in Norfolk.

00:29:22.820 --> 00:29:23.820
 But he used to live in London.

00:29:23.820 --> 00:29:26.820
 And most of his days were people just hopping into the back.

00:29:26.820 --> 00:29:27.820
 [LAUGHTER]

00:29:27.820 --> 00:29:29.820
 And seeing Stephen Fry up there.

00:29:29.820 --> 00:29:31.820
 Oh, yeah, Stephen Fry in the front of my car.

00:29:31.820 --> 00:29:34.820
 [LAUGHTER]

00:29:34.820 --> 00:29:35.820
 Prince Philip.

00:29:35.820 --> 00:29:36.820
 Oh, Prince Philip.

00:29:36.820 --> 00:29:37.820
 And yours?

00:29:37.820 --> 00:29:40.820
 [LAUGHTER]

00:29:40.820 --> 00:29:43.820
 That was a risky one, man.

00:29:43.820 --> 00:29:44.820
 [LAUGHTER]

00:29:44.820 --> 00:29:47.820
 He had a private cab, but he only gave it up last year.

00:29:47.820 --> 00:29:48.820
 Did he?

00:29:48.820 --> 00:29:49.820
 Yeah.

00:29:49.820 --> 00:29:50.820
 Good, so.

00:29:50.820 --> 00:29:53.820
 [LAUGHTER]

00:29:53.820 --> 00:29:56.820
 You know, the first drunk driving incident was a taxi driver.

00:29:56.820 --> 00:29:58.820
 And this was also in 1897, actually.

00:29:58.820 --> 00:30:00.820
 This was a cab driver called George Smith

00:30:00.820 --> 00:30:02.820
 who drove his taxi straight into the side of a building

00:30:02.820 --> 00:30:03.820
 and rode it off.

00:30:03.820 --> 00:30:05.820
 He was arrested for drunk driving.

00:30:05.820 --> 00:30:06.820
 First person ever.

00:30:06.820 --> 00:30:09.820
 And the police officers couldn't prove it.

00:30:09.820 --> 00:30:10.820
 But they knew he was drunk.

00:30:10.820 --> 00:30:11.820
 Because apparently he was acting drunk.

00:30:11.820 --> 00:30:12.820
 And he said he was drunk.

00:30:12.820 --> 00:30:17.820
 But after that, they realized that they needed a test for it.

00:30:17.820 --> 00:30:19.820
 And that's where the breathalyzer came from.

00:30:19.820 --> 00:30:20.820
 So they based the breathalyzer on that.

00:30:20.820 --> 00:30:21.820
 And initially it was a balloon.

00:30:21.820 --> 00:30:22.820
 And you blew into a balloon.

00:30:22.820 --> 00:30:24.820
 And then you put the end of the balloon

00:30:24.820 --> 00:30:29.820
 over a bottle of chemicals, which changed from purple to yellow.

00:30:29.820 --> 00:30:31.820
 And it didn't work very well.

00:30:31.820 --> 00:30:33.820
 Because there was no measure of how drunk you were.

00:30:33.820 --> 00:30:35.820
 It just changed from purple to yellow.

00:30:35.820 --> 00:30:37.820
 And you went, I don't know how yellow is that.

00:30:37.820 --> 00:30:39.820
 Is that like yellow and is that bright enough yellow?

00:30:39.820 --> 00:30:40.820
 Yeah, let's arrest him.

00:30:40.820 --> 00:30:43.820
 We need to move on very soon.

00:30:43.820 --> 00:30:47.820
 Do you know where the word taxi comes from?

00:30:47.820 --> 00:30:49.820
 No.

00:30:49.820 --> 00:30:51.820
 Taxis.

00:30:51.820 --> 00:30:54.820
 Arrangement means movement in Latin.

00:30:54.820 --> 00:30:56.820
 Yeah, it comes from the word taxi meter.

00:30:56.820 --> 00:30:57.820
 Oh, okay.

00:30:57.820 --> 00:30:58.820
 Isn't that weird?

00:30:58.820 --> 00:31:01.820
 What was the taxi meter before a taxi then?

00:31:01.820 --> 00:31:02.820
 It had a different name.

00:31:02.820 --> 00:31:03.820
 But then someone invented the taxi meter

00:31:03.820 --> 00:31:05.820
 and they were like, oh, that's a fantastic one.

00:31:05.820 --> 00:31:06.820
 What are we going to put this in?

00:31:06.820 --> 00:31:07.820
 Yeah.

00:31:07.820 --> 00:31:15.820
 So they built a car around it.

00:31:15.820 --> 00:31:18.820
 Okay, we need to move on to our final fact of the show.

00:31:18.820 --> 00:31:20.820
 And that is James.

00:31:20.820 --> 00:31:24.820
 Okay, my fact this week is that the Gulf Corvina fish

00:31:24.820 --> 00:31:33.820
 has such loud sex that it can deafened dolphins.

00:31:33.820 --> 00:31:41.820
 That is, they shouldn't be listening to pervers.

00:31:41.820 --> 00:31:44.820
 So the Gulf Corvina is a Mexican fish.

00:31:44.820 --> 00:31:48.820
 They have sex in huge orgies with lots of these fish.

00:31:48.820 --> 00:31:52.820
 And they have mating calls that sound like rapid sounding pulses

00:31:52.820 --> 00:31:53.820
 like a machine gun.

00:31:53.820 --> 00:31:57.820
 And you get a whole load of them together because it's an orgie

00:31:57.820 --> 00:32:00.820
 and that's what happens, I believe, apologies.

00:32:00.820 --> 00:32:03.820
 And apparently it sounds like a crowd cheering at a football stadium

00:32:03.820 --> 00:32:06.820
 or a really, really loud beehive.

00:32:06.820 --> 00:32:09.820
 And there was a guy who studies them called Timothy Rothwell

00:32:09.820 --> 00:32:11.820
 and he said that the sound was literally so loud

00:32:11.820 --> 00:32:13.820
 that he had to shout to talk to the rest of the team

00:32:13.820 --> 00:32:15.820
 when he was studying them.

00:32:15.820 --> 00:32:16.820
 And he's above water.

00:32:16.820 --> 00:32:18.820
 So you can still hear it there.

00:32:18.820 --> 00:32:19.820
 Yeah, it's incredible.

00:32:19.820 --> 00:32:21.820
 I listened to a sound file of it today.

00:32:21.820 --> 00:32:25.820
 And yeah, you could sound only I know, right?

00:32:25.820 --> 00:32:30.820
 Mr. Allen, the good stuff.

00:32:30.820 --> 00:32:33.820
 It does sound like a sort of...

00:32:33.820 --> 00:32:36.820
 Kind of like a machine gun sound that you were talking about.

00:32:36.820 --> 00:32:39.820
 I imagine, you know, in Australia when you press those buttons

00:32:39.820 --> 00:32:43.820
 to cross the streets and they just go, "Did you just like that?"

00:32:43.820 --> 00:32:45.820
 Yeah, that's actually...

00:32:45.820 --> 00:32:49.820
 Not many people know that that's the sound of it.

00:32:49.820 --> 00:32:51.820
 A little known fact.

00:32:51.820 --> 00:32:56.820
 And this kind of orgy thing, the frenzy thing that they do

00:32:56.820 --> 00:32:59.820
 basically sees all of the world's adult covenors

00:32:59.820 --> 00:33:02.820
 gathered in less than 1% of their usual home.

00:33:02.820 --> 00:33:04.820
 So they all come from all different places.

00:33:04.820 --> 00:33:06.820
 They all come to this one place.

00:33:06.820 --> 00:33:09.820
 So it's like everyone getting into one cupboard for the orgy.

00:33:09.820 --> 00:33:14.820
 Well, not really.

00:33:14.820 --> 00:33:17.820
 It's less than 1% of their usual home.

00:33:17.820 --> 00:33:20.820
 Yeah, but it's like that.

00:33:20.820 --> 00:33:22.820
 But everyone in your home.

00:33:22.820 --> 00:33:25.820
 So it's just for you and your girlfriend, I guess.

00:33:25.820 --> 00:33:30.820
 Just like you and your girlfriend getting in a cupboard.

00:33:30.820 --> 00:33:33.820
 I worked out the numbers and it was a bit like...

00:33:33.820 --> 00:33:35.820
 It's a bit like everyone in London going to Disneyland

00:33:35.820 --> 00:33:37.820
 once a year to have sex.

00:33:37.820 --> 00:33:38.820
 That that size.

00:33:38.820 --> 00:33:43.820
 And that I know is a contravention of parcels.

00:33:43.820 --> 00:33:45.820
 I don't like it.

00:33:45.820 --> 00:33:48.820
 And how do you know that?

00:33:48.820 --> 00:33:53.820
 That's why you guys have to do it in the cupboard now, right?

00:33:53.820 --> 00:33:57.820
 Everyone knows it's Disneyland or a cupboard.

00:33:57.820 --> 00:33:59.820
 It's actually really inconvenient for these fish

00:33:59.820 --> 00:34:00.820
 that they do this, right?

00:34:00.820 --> 00:34:01.820
 Yeah.

00:34:01.820 --> 00:34:03.820
 Because as you say, they all gather together to have sex.

00:34:03.820 --> 00:34:04.820
 And they're really tasty.

00:34:04.820 --> 00:34:05.820
 They're a delicacy.

00:34:05.820 --> 00:34:08.820
 And fishermen go to where they gather to have sex.

00:34:08.820 --> 00:34:10.820
 And then they make this huge noise

00:34:10.820 --> 00:34:12.820
 to really advertise exactly where they are.

00:34:12.820 --> 00:34:14.820
 And so fishermen know exactly where to go to fish for them.

00:34:14.820 --> 00:34:18.820
 Yeah, it's not the worst fish sex tactic.

00:34:18.820 --> 00:34:22.820
 So there is a fantastic book by Mara J. Hart.

00:34:22.820 --> 00:34:23.820
 It's called Sex in the Sea.

00:34:23.820 --> 00:34:24.820
 I highly recommend it.

00:34:24.820 --> 00:34:26.820
 It's all about this sort of thing.

00:34:26.820 --> 00:34:27.820
 I don't recommend it.

00:34:27.820 --> 00:34:29.820
 Now are you mind why I recommend it?

00:34:29.820 --> 00:34:31.820
 All for that matter why I bought it.

00:34:31.820 --> 00:34:37.820
 But it has information about fish.

00:34:37.820 --> 00:34:40.820
 You were very disappointed it was a non-fiction book.

00:34:40.820 --> 00:34:44.820
 Anyway, no, they're a fish called Grunnan.

00:34:44.820 --> 00:34:47.820
 And they, to have sex, throw themselves onto land,

00:34:47.820 --> 00:34:50.820
 which is very inconvenient because they are fish.

00:34:50.820 --> 00:34:53.820
 And the female has to dig a hole in the sand

00:34:53.820 --> 00:34:57.820
 and then bury herself in the sand until there's only her head sticking out.

00:34:57.820 --> 00:34:58.820
 She starts laying eggs.

00:34:58.820 --> 00:35:01.820
 And then the male jumps on her and spoons her and her sex with her.

00:35:01.820 --> 00:35:05.820
 And he uses her as a slide for his sperm,

00:35:05.820 --> 00:35:06.820
 which lands on the eggs.

00:35:06.820 --> 00:35:09.820
 And then they have to try and catch a wave back.

00:35:09.820 --> 00:35:13.820
 It sounds like the most inconvenient mating ritual you could imagine.

00:35:13.820 --> 00:35:16.820
 And yeah, she can't breathe through any of it.

00:35:16.820 --> 00:35:17.820
 Right.

00:35:17.820 --> 00:35:18.820
 So it's so unpleasant.

00:35:18.820 --> 00:35:20.820
 And they're all Jesus' well, aren't they?

00:35:20.820 --> 00:35:24.820
 So often she's got a few males curved around her while suffocating to death,

00:35:24.820 --> 00:35:26.820
 while attempting to procreate.

00:35:26.820 --> 00:35:28.820
 It's a very bad deal.

00:35:28.820 --> 00:35:32.820
 We actually have it quite good, guys, but I can understand.

00:35:32.820 --> 00:35:37.820
 I started reading about, so dolphins are going death off the back of these fish having sex.

00:35:37.820 --> 00:35:42.820
 And I was looking into dolphin sex to see what they...

00:35:42.820 --> 00:35:44.820
 And this is really cool.

00:35:44.820 --> 00:35:51.820
 Did you watch "Flipper 3" in the course of your research?

00:35:51.820 --> 00:35:56.820
 So this is Australian scientists have found that dolphins,

00:35:56.820 --> 00:35:59.820
 they've observed them doing this new thing where they come to surface

00:35:59.820 --> 00:36:03.820
 and they pull like a banana shape so their head goes up and their back goes up

00:36:03.820 --> 00:36:05.820
 and they sit there like a big banana.

00:36:05.820 --> 00:36:08.820
 And that's apparently really attractive.

00:36:08.820 --> 00:36:10.820
 And look at the banana.

00:36:10.820 --> 00:36:13.820
 And that's like a new mating thing that we've not noticed before.

00:36:13.820 --> 00:36:15.820
 This was last year that we discovered this.

00:36:15.820 --> 00:36:19.820
 And also what they do is these are humpback dolphins.

00:36:19.820 --> 00:36:24.820
 They dig down and they break off coral and they wear them on their nose as a little hat.

00:36:24.820 --> 00:36:25.820
 So they have a hat.

00:36:25.820 --> 00:36:26.820
 Yeah.

00:36:26.820 --> 00:36:31.820
 And again, so the mid-banana move with coral on their nose

00:36:31.820 --> 00:36:35.820
 and people or other dolphins are looking at them.

00:36:35.820 --> 00:36:36.820
 And sexy.

00:36:36.820 --> 00:36:37.820
 Yeah, that's sex.

00:36:37.820 --> 00:36:38.820
 Yeah.

00:36:38.820 --> 00:36:43.820
 Although they like to avoid males sometimes, so dolphin females are often really hassled

00:36:43.820 --> 00:36:46.820
 by the males and kind of gang-banged.

00:36:46.820 --> 00:36:50.820
 And so they really will have lots of males chase them at the same time,

00:36:50.820 --> 00:36:53.820
 try to have sex with them and they flip over in the water and they stick

00:36:53.820 --> 00:36:56.820
 their reproductive parts out of the water and the males can't get them at all.

00:36:56.820 --> 00:36:57.820
 Really?

00:36:57.820 --> 00:36:58.820
 Yeah.

00:36:58.820 --> 00:37:05.820
 They also slap them in the face with their tails quite a lot when they're being chased.

00:37:05.820 --> 00:37:06.820
 Yeah.

00:37:06.820 --> 00:37:10.820
 Sorry, I said coral sponges.

00:37:10.820 --> 00:37:12.820
 They put sponges on their nose.

00:37:12.820 --> 00:37:13.820
 Yeah.

00:37:13.820 --> 00:37:14.820
 Yeah.

00:37:14.820 --> 00:37:15.820
 That makes more sense to them.

00:37:15.820 --> 00:37:16.820
 Yeah.

00:37:16.820 --> 00:37:19.820
 There's, I was looking at some fish sounds.

00:37:19.820 --> 00:37:20.820
 Oh yeah.

00:37:20.820 --> 00:37:23.820
 Because underwater creatures have the most amazing ways of making noise.

00:37:23.820 --> 00:37:25.820
 And it works completely differently underwater.

00:37:25.820 --> 00:37:29.820
 So clown fish make a chirping noise by gnashing their teeth.

00:37:29.820 --> 00:37:33.820
 They literally, the only way they can communicate is by snapping their teeth together.

00:37:33.820 --> 00:37:35.820
 They're oyster toad fish.

00:37:35.820 --> 00:37:39.820
 They make a blur like a folk horn noise by contracting their swimming bladders.

00:37:39.820 --> 00:37:43.820
 And there's gurami which snap the tendons of their pectoral fins.

00:37:43.820 --> 00:37:47.820
 So they basically clap their fins together, I suppose, in order to communicate with each other.

00:37:47.820 --> 00:37:48.820
 That's cool.

00:37:48.820 --> 00:37:50.820
 But they can be super loud fish.

00:37:50.820 --> 00:37:54.820
 They've, they have been known to keep people awake at night, haven't they?

00:37:54.820 --> 00:37:56.820
 I think we've covered various things in the past.

00:37:56.820 --> 00:38:00.820
 I think a lot of the facts here are going to keep me awake at night.

00:38:00.820 --> 00:38:04.820
 But I think the problem was, is that Jacques Cousteau did a documentary, didn't he?

00:38:04.820 --> 00:38:06.820
 In 1956 called The Silent World.

00:38:06.820 --> 00:38:07.820
 Oh yeah.

00:38:07.820 --> 00:38:09.820
 And it was all about the underwater.

00:38:09.820 --> 00:38:13.820
 But basically, his diving tanks masked all the sounds of the water.

00:38:13.820 --> 00:38:15.820
 So he was like, oh, it's so quiet in here.

00:38:15.820 --> 00:38:18.820
 And actually, that's just where his microphones were.

00:38:18.820 --> 00:38:20.820
 And so lots of people thought it was really quiet.

00:38:20.820 --> 00:38:22.820
 But like you say, and it is loud as hell as well.

00:38:22.820 --> 00:38:24.820
 It's noisy, even though it doesn't really work very well with our ears.

00:38:24.820 --> 00:38:25.820
 Because I thought this was really interesting.

00:38:25.820 --> 00:38:29.820
 So sound waves, because they travel a different way in water, how they do an air.

00:38:29.820 --> 00:38:30.820
 And we've got air in our ear.

00:38:30.820 --> 00:38:33.820
 That's why sound is messed up for us underwater.

00:38:33.820 --> 00:38:35.820
 But that's also why whales.

00:38:35.820 --> 00:38:38.820
 You know, they have huge amounts of wax in there is.

00:38:38.820 --> 00:38:42.820
 So you see whales ear wax, it comes, you know, many, many inches long ear wax.

00:38:42.820 --> 00:38:44.820
 And that's kind of the same density as water.

00:38:44.820 --> 00:38:47.820
 So that means that the sound waves can travel into there is.

00:38:47.820 --> 00:38:48.820
 And they'd be fine.

00:38:48.820 --> 00:38:53.820
 But it's assumed that if they came up onto the surface, they would be deaf in air.

00:38:53.820 --> 00:38:54.820
 Really?

00:38:54.820 --> 00:38:55.820
 Yeah.

00:38:55.820 --> 00:38:56.820
 That's how you make a fish deaf.

00:38:56.820 --> 00:39:00.820
 Just on sex sounds, peacocks have been observed on land.

00:39:00.820 --> 00:39:02.820
 As opposed, yeah.

00:39:02.820 --> 00:39:04.820
 Peacocks.

00:39:04.820 --> 00:39:07.820
 They do not thrive underwater.

00:39:07.820 --> 00:39:15.820
 So peacocks have been found to be doing a full sex sound in order to attract mates.

00:39:15.820 --> 00:39:19.820
 So what will happen is while they're mating, they have this sound that they do,

00:39:19.820 --> 00:39:22.820
 which is, which they'll just go the whole way through.

00:39:22.820 --> 00:39:23.820
 Do it now.

00:39:23.820 --> 00:39:24.820
 Come on.

00:39:24.820 --> 00:39:27.820
 I haven't, annoyingly could not find that audio file.

00:39:27.820 --> 00:39:29.820
 But they, so they make this sound.

00:39:29.820 --> 00:39:32.820
 And then the thing is, it's a very loud sound that the male makes.

00:39:32.820 --> 00:39:37.820
 So while it's happening, other females in the area will hear it at a distance and go,

00:39:37.820 --> 00:39:40.820
 "Ooh, that sounds like a good guy to reproduce with."

00:39:40.820 --> 00:39:41.820
 Which is what they're trying to do.

00:39:41.820 --> 00:39:43.820
 So that's what they listen out for.

00:39:43.820 --> 00:39:51.820
 And if they, the reason that that's good, that sound is it means that someone has picked them as genetically good to reproduce.

00:39:51.820 --> 00:39:52.820
 And so that's very important.

00:39:52.820 --> 00:39:57.820
 So peacocks are not good at reproducing genetically, have worked out this trick.

00:39:57.820 --> 00:40:04.820
 Where if they just make the sound even though they're not having sex, female peacocks will hear them in the distance going, "Whoa, that guy must be awesome."

00:40:04.820 --> 00:40:07.820
 And head over to do it.

00:40:07.820 --> 00:40:13.820
 We've discussed this before, I think. So a lot of animals do these fake calls.

00:40:13.820 --> 00:40:15.820
 But there are some where they can't do fake calls, isn't it?

00:40:15.820 --> 00:40:17.820
 And I reckon it's, is it Elans?

00:40:17.820 --> 00:40:19.820
 They click their knees or something like this.

00:40:19.820 --> 00:40:20.820
 Yes, they do.

00:40:20.820 --> 00:40:24.820
 And that is a thing which is attractive to women if they click their knees.

00:40:24.820 --> 00:40:26.820
 But only the big ones can make the noise.

00:40:26.820 --> 00:40:29.820
 And it's impossible for the small ones to fake it.

00:40:29.820 --> 00:40:31.820
 Yes, there's an honest signal.

00:40:31.820 --> 00:40:35.820
 Whereas the peacocks can just stand in their windows going, "Oh, wow!"

00:40:35.820 --> 00:40:39.820
 Oh, yeah!

00:40:39.820 --> 00:40:42.820
 What's that? Oh, yeah, I know I'm good.

00:40:42.820 --> 00:40:45.820
 What great! Wow!

00:40:45.820 --> 00:40:48.820
 Okay, that is it. That is all of our facts.

00:40:48.820 --> 00:40:49.820
