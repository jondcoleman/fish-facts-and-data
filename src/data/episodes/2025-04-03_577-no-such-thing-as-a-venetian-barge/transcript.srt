1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:14,780
 - Hello and welcome to another episode

3
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:16,620
 of No Such Thing as a Fish,

4
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:18,620
 a weekly podcast coming to you

5
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:21,060
 from the QI offices in Hoburn.

6
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:22,260
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

7
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:24,940
 I am sitting here with Andrew Hunter Murray,

8
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:27,420
 James Harkin and Anna Tyshinski.

9
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:30,060
 Once again, we have gathered around the microphones

10
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:33,660
 with our four favorite facts of the last seven days.

11
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:37,180
 And in no particular order, here we go.

12
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:40,900
 Starting with fact number one, that is Anna.

13
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:43,660
 - My fact this week is that some planes

14
00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:47,500
 are specifically built to carry other planes' wings.

15
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:48,980
 How degrading.

16
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:49,900
 - Is it?

17
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:52,340
 - I think it's a bit degrading for those planes.

18
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:53,820
 Just, you know, you're the--

19
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:55,180
 - Oh, I think they're the king planes.

20
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:56,700
 - Well, the wing was that, do you?

21
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:57,900
 - Yeah, I think they're the planes

22
00:00:57,900 --> 00:00:59,500
 without which other planes cannot be.

23
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:01,380
 - I think they're more like a wingman.

24
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:03,300
 - Very nice. - Nice.

25
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:06,160
 Well, whatever their social hierarchical status

26
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:09,940
 in plane community, these are really cool looking planes.

27
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:11,740
 So I was just reading about plane construction,

28
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:12,580
 how planes are put together.

29
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:14,420
 And it was saying how all the different bits

30
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:15,420
 are made in different places.

31
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:17,220
 And I was thinking how on Earth they get them

32
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:18,700
 to where they're assembled.

33
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:22,640
 And for Airbus, which is the world's biggest aircraft maker,

34
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,860
 they use this thing called Beluga XL,

35
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:28,460
 which looks just like a Beluga whale,

36
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:29,300
 which is quite cool.

37
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:31,500
 It's got the big, we've talked about melons, haven't we,

38
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:33,700
 on the podcast for their big foreheads.

39
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:34,540
 James is looking skeptical.

40
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:36,540
 It doesn't look exactly like a Beluga whale.

41
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:37,580
 You wouldn't confuse it with one.

42
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:38,540
 - I've seen the image.

43
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:39,620
 I think they look a bit like them.

44
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:41,540
 I'm just trying to think if the average listener

45
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:43,460
 is gonna know what a Beluga looks like.

46
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:45,220
 - Maybe a dolphin, I think a picture of dolphin.

47
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:46,900
 - A dolphin with a big melon on its head.

48
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:48,660
 - Big bulbous head, yeah.

49
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:50,620
 And they paint them to look like Beluga whales.

50
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:53,580
 They paint the smile on to make them look friendly.

51
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:56,380
 - They're very charming looking planes.

52
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:57,220
 And they are amazing.

53
00:01:57,220 --> 00:01:59,180
 So they are as long as two blue whales,

54
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:00,740
 just to continue the whale analogy.

55
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:02,380
 - Yeah, they're the biggest whale in the world

56
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:03,700
 as a result, aren't they?

57
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:04,540
 (laughing)

58
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:06,180
 - Oh, nice.

59
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:07,940
 - And they're designed,

60
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:10,740
 they can carry two wings for an Airbus A350,

61
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:12,260
 which is itself a really big plane.

62
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:13,680
 And they were designed, I think specifically,

63
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,060
 to carry two of those, to fit them in,

64
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:17,880
 because those wings are massive.

65
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:21,060
 And the whole face of the whale comes off.

66
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:22,260
 So you don't load them in the back.

67
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:23,420
 You just pull off the whale's head.

68
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:25,980
 - Well, it sort of lifts up, it lifts up, doesn't it?

69
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:27,980
 - So do the wings go on the inside?

70
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:28,820
 - Yeah, yes.

71
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:30,620
 - Did you not just attach them to the actual wings?

72
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:32,660
 - But then how do you fly back when you get there?

73
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:34,260
 - No, double wings, get them there faster.

74
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:35,380
 - Oh, like a biplane.

75
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:36,340
 - A biplane.

76
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:37,660
 - I don't know why they haven't thought of that.

77
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:38,500
 - Yes.

78
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:41,780
 But the Beluga is one of the smallest whales in the world.

79
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:44,620
 So actually, it should be a very small plane.

80
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:45,460
 - Yeah.

81
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:46,280
 - That is poorly named.

82
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,300
 - Yeah, yeah, silly.

83
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:48,300
 - You know it's crazy as well.

84
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:51,540
 So the Beluga XL is a more recent innovation

85
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:52,860
 from the original Beluga.

86
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:57,700
 The number of staff on the plane at any one time

87
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:59,700
 on the original Belugas, it's just two.

88
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:01,500
 - Really?

89
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:02,340
 - That's it.

90
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:03,180
 You put the wings in.

91
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:04,020
 - Pilot, co-pilot.

92
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:04,860
 - Pilot, co-pilot.

93
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:08,400
 - I assume not like two flight attendants.

94
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,220
 (all laughing)

95
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:14,500
 - But now the XL has a third member, the load master.

96
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,060
 - Oh, cool.

97
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:18,460
 - Suggested one person's loading the wings on.

98
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:20,060
 - She is quite wild.

99
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:22,140
 - Is it to make sure I suppose that they stay strapped down

100
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:22,980
 during the flight?

101
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:23,820
 - Yeah.

102
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:24,740
 - It's all right.

103
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:25,580
 I got it.

104
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:27,020
 - That's a pretty sexy job title.

105
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:27,860
 - Yeah, load master.

106
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:28,700
 - What are you?

107
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:29,540
 Oh, I'm a load master.

108
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:30,380
 - Oh yeah, and what do you do?

109
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:35,060
 - I watch small piece of Velcro in terror,

110
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:36,620
 fearing it's gonna come undone.

111
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:37,460
 - Cool, cool.

112
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:40,460
 I'm gonna speak to this person over here now.

113
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:42,420
 (all laughing)

114
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:43,540
 They didn't always use aeroplanes

115
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:45,220
 to get these things around.

116
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:48,940
 The Airbus A380, they used to move everything around

117
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:53,620
 using something called the Itinerair, a grand gabarit.

118
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:55,900
 And that is a water and road route

119
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:58,380
 that was created just to move pieces

120
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:00,020
 of this aeroplane around Europe.

121
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:00,860
 - No way.

122
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:01,700
 - So cool.

123
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:04,540
 - They dig sort of giant canals across Europe

124
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:05,500
 that we didn't notice.

125
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:08,220
 - Well, I think they more used existing canals

126
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:09,460
 and made them a bit wider.

127
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:10,300
 - Cool.

128
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:11,140
 - And also use existing roads

129
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:12,260
 and made them a bit stronger.

130
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:14,300
 But basically they were put together in Toulouse,

131
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:17,260
 but the bits were made in France, Germany, Spain,

132
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:18,660
 United Kingdom even.

133
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:21,740
 And so they had to bring all the bits together to Toulouse

134
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:22,580
 so they could make them.

135
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:24,100
 But they had to reinforce everything

136
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:25,140
 because they're so big.

137
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:25,980
 - Right.

138
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:27,300
 - And they would always travel at night time.

139
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:28,420
 - That's so cool.

140
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:30,900
 - So they'd park up in some lay by during the day.

141
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:33,020
 And then at night time, they'd drive around with these.

142
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:35,060
 - They do all these big load people,

143
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:36,780
 largely 'cause it's a real inconvenience in the day,

144
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:38,300
 but that makes it sound sexy as well.

145
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:39,140
 - Oh, it sounds covert, yeah.

146
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:40,540
 - When it's the only travel at night.

147
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:42,020
 - I'm a night load mask.

148
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:43,860
 - Yeah, I don't normally come to these parties

149
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:46,180
 because I'm a bit of a night load mask.

150
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:48,140
 (all laughing)

151
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:49,460
 - On that, James.

152
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:51,740
 So you know how NASA gets its rockets around?

153
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:54,260
 - I do actually.

154
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:55,100
 - Okay.

155
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:56,700
 Well, can you pretend you don't for them?

156
00:04:56,700 --> 00:05:01,180
 - No, do they attach balloons to it and float it around?

157
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:05,500
 - No, they use barges.

158
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:07,540
 They have a barge called Pegasus.

159
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:09,020
 And they load the rocket on,

160
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:11,660
 'cause it's from the assembly factories in Louisiana.

161
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:12,500
 And they need to get it

162
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:14,380
 to the Kennedy Space Center in Florida.

163
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:15,540
 And it's 100 meters long

164
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:16,660
 and they just load the rocket on.

165
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:17,660
 And then it doesn't have an engine.

166
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:19,620
 The tugs have to just tug it all the way.

167
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:21,220
 - How far are those two places apart?

168
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:22,860
 - They're quite far.

169
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:24,300
 - From where to where, sorry?

170
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:26,740
 - From Louisiana to the Cape Battle,

171
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:28,740
 it's probably about 400 miles, I'd say.

172
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:30,900
 - Yeah, you wouldn't walk it at a gas.

173
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:32,220
 - So I think that's weird, isn't it?

174
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:34,780
 - It's weird because the word barge is so,

175
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:36,460
 yeah, you picture it's like toad in the hole or something.

176
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:37,300
 - We're in Venice.

177
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:39,060
 - Yeah, all Venice.

178
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:41,500
 - If you go to Venice with your wife,

179
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:43,460
 are you saying, "Hey, let's get a barge."

180
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:44,700
 (all laughing)

181
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:45,540
 - Darling.

182
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:47,160
 - You've got us the most amazing deal.

183
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,780
 (all laughing)

184
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:51,080
 - Now there will only be three staff on the barge.

185
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:52,740
 (all laughing)

186
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:54,740
 - But we will velcro you down.

187
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:57,060
 Now, yeah, what I found interesting about that NASA barge

188
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:59,980
 is actually it's only about 50% longer

189
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:02,340
 and wider than a standard canal boat.

190
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:05,100
 'Cause canal boats are quite long, aren't they?

191
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:05,940
 - Wow.

192
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:07,660
 - I mean, having stayed on a canal boat for a week,

193
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:08,940
 it doesn't feel spacious.

194
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:11,500
 - Maybe not a narrow boat, like the tiny narrow boats.

195
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:12,340
 'Cause those are--

196
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:15,020
 - Oh, I'm not talking about a rising-gym style narrow boat.

197
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:17,220
 - It's 310 by 50 feet.

198
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:19,260
 So I'm pretty sure that that's not,

199
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:22,020
 it's only, it's not twice as big as a normal canal boat.

200
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:23,700
 It's pretty amazing, isn't it?

201
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:24,860
 - It is amazing.

202
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:26,820
 - But they have got another way of doing it, haven't they?

203
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:29,140
 They use a thing called the pregnant guppy.

204
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:29,980
 - Oh!

205
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:32,780
 - Which is a modified Boeing 377.

206
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:34,020
 - Yes, and this was at the start,

207
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:35,700
 well, they made their first pregnant guppy

208
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:37,580
 start of the space race.

209
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:39,620
 So I think then they went back to barges for a while

210
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:42,500
 'cause this was in the '60s

211
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:44,740
 and it was a massive problem.

212
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:46,540
 'Cause at that time, they were made on the West Coast

213
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:48,620
 and then had to be taken to Cape Canaveral.

214
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:50,700
 And yeah, it was just taking forever

215
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:52,860
 and they had to go through the Panama Canal and--

216
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:53,700
 - So far.

217
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:55,260
 - It took about a couple of days.

218
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:56,620
 - You mean the America Canal?

219
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:59,700
 - Sorry, sorry, yes.

220
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:03,300
 And they took the transport time from 25 to 35 days

221
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:07,180
 down to 18 hours, but it was,

222
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:08,740
 that's what inspired the Beluga designs.

223
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:10,540
 'Cause if you look at them, they look kind of similar,

224
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:11,380
 don't they?

225
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:12,220
 - They really do, yeah.

226
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:13,740
 - The pregnant guppy, the pregnant guppy inspired them.

227
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:15,740
 - Yeah, absolutely, they're all nautical,

228
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:18,780
 or they're all sea creatures, guppies and belugas.

229
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:21,100
 - Yeah, I think that's a good thing.

230
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:22,420
 The beluga was a nod to the guppy.

231
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:23,660
 - 'Cause the guy who created the guppy

232
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:24,860
 was a guy called John M. Conroy

233
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:25,940
 and he also came up with a plane

234
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:28,940
 called the Conroy Sky Monster, cool.

235
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:31,420
 Just such great names these planes have, so cool.

236
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:33,860
 Hey, this is pretty cool, the Beluga XL,

237
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:35,900
 it doesn't just take wings.

238
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:38,020
 It often gets, well, sometimes gets asked

239
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:39,260
 to bring a few other things.

240
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:41,300
 And at one time in 1999,

241
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:44,820
 it carried the liberty leading the people painting.

242
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:47,860
 So this is that French painting by Eugene Deliffoy.

243
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:51,900
 - And the things you make when you say that,

244
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:53,700
 it's such a shame the listener can't see it.

245
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:55,700
 - It's why I'm not allowed to go to France.

246
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:57,340
 And yeah, so that's very famous, isn't it?

247
00:07:57,340 --> 00:07:59,460
 - It's a massive campus.

248
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:01,740
 - Like one of them's holding a big flag.

249
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:04,380
 - Yeah, there's a lady in a bit of a state of undress.

250
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:06,100
 She's definitely in an emotional state.

251
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:06,940
 - Yeah, yeah.

252
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:07,780
 - She's got the flag.

253
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:08,740
 - One of the buttons has fallen off.

254
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:09,580
 - Yes.

255
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:11,500
 - And she'll be livid when she finds out

256
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:12,740
 someone was painting that scene.

257
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:14,300
 (all laughing)

258
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:16,420
 It was learned from Paris to Tokyo.

259
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:18,220
 And so they needed to get it over there.

260
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:21,180
 It's too large to fit in what was, I guess,

261
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:23,580
 the biggest transport plane at the time, Boeing 747.

262
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:27,100
 So they needed to use a Beluga in order to do it.

263
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:32,100
 It is a 9.8 feet tall and 11.8 feet long.

264
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:34,340
 - That is small.

265
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:35,820
 - I feel like I've been in a Boeing 747.

266
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:37,740
 - That's about the same size as this wall, isn't it?

267
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:38,580
 - Yeah.

268
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:39,420
 - It's a bit smaller.

269
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:40,260
 - It's a bit taller and a bit smaller.

270
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:41,580
 - But you've got to package it up

271
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:43,700
 and you need to make sure it's really good packaging, right?

272
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:45,300
 So that's going to add exercise.

273
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:47,580
 I mean, have you ever, tons of bubble wrap?

274
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:49,220
 You know, in your order for, like a, you know,

275
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:51,740
 sometimes you order just like a lipstick from Amazon.

276
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:52,580
 - Always, yeah.

277
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:54,060
 - Yeah, it comes in a giant box.

278
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:57,820
 - I was on a flight last week and I bought a bag of crisps.

279
00:08:57,820 --> 00:08:58,980
 And then I forgot about it.

280
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:00,060
 And then halfway through the flight, I went,

281
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:01,260
 "Oh, I'll have that bag of crisps."

282
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:04,660
 I went to my bag and the bag of crisps was enormous.

283
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:05,980
 Like, 'cause the pressure changed, right?

284
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:07,140
 - Oh, right.

285
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:08,580
 - Okay, so it would like, okay.

286
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:11,020
 So I wondered if you had an enormous bubble wrap

287
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:13,060
 around your painting,

288
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:14,780
 where the whole thing would just balloon

289
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:16,140
 to like 10 times the size.

290
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:17,500
 - So it looks small when you put it in

291
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:19,060
 and everyone's going, "That could fit on a seven,

292
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:22,580
 "fourth sense level, you wait 'til we get in the air."

293
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:24,260
 - But yeah, they had to put it in a vertical position.

294
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:26,660
 There was a special pressurized container

295
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:27,900
 so it didn't get damaged on the way.

296
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:30,060
 And they had these anti-vibration devices

297
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:31,420
 that were in it as well.

298
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:32,260
 Yeah.

299
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:33,100
 - I feel like this is missing flow.

300
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:34,340
 - Just in case the load master got excited.

301
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:36,660
 (all laughing)

302
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:37,980
 - Loopy plates.

303
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:38,820
 - Okay.

304
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:42,020
 - So various countries have really led the field in this.

305
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:46,140
 I think the Germans had a pretty good record for a while.

306
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:49,260
 Did you hear about the Blohmann Ross BV-141?

307
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:51,740
 (all laughing)

308
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:53,620
 - I'm just gonna go speak to this guy now.

309
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:55,780
 (all laughing)

310
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:56,620
 - This is so amazing.

311
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:59,460
 So picture a classic, let's say a bomber plane from the war.

312
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:01,460
 You know, you've got the main fuselage in the middle,

313
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:02,780
 you've got the wings on either side

314
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:04,340
 and you've got an engine on each wing

315
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:06,060
 and maybe the propeller on each.

316
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:06,900
 - Got it.

317
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:07,820
 - Classic engine.

318
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:08,980
 - Yeah, classic plane.

319
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:11,180
 - Maybe next time just say picture a plane.

320
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:13,380
 (all laughing)

321
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:15,660
 - Picture a plane, you're ahead of the top.

322
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:16,860
 - Second one, more plane.

323
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:18,460
 - Second one, more style bomber, right?

324
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:21,740
 This was a plane which had the fuselage, sure,

325
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:23,140
 but that's not in the middle.

326
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:23,980
 - Uh-huh.

327
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:25,860
 - So there's a wing, then there's a fuselage,

328
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:26,860
 then there's a separate wing

329
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:28,700
 and the crew are sitting in a little pod

330
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:30,260
 halfway along that wing.

331
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:31,100
 - Oh, cool.

332
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:33,260
 - It is the weirdest looking thing.

333
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:34,340
 - But what's the reason?

334
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:35,580
 - Reconnaissance.

335
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:38,340
 - So it gave a better view for reconnaissance photos

336
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:41,020
 to have you not being in the main bit of the plane.

337
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:43,420
 - Okay, well, 'cause the wing doesn't get in the way maybe.

338
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:45,060
 I always think the wing gets in the way of the view a bit

339
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:45,900
 when you look out the wings.

340
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:46,740
 - Yeah.

341
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:48,420
 - And that's actually invented a wingless plane

342
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:50,700
 which they flew called the flying bathtub.

343
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:51,940
 (all laughing)

344
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:53,860
 And it was in the 1960s, they're experimenting.

345
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:54,820
 If you look at a photo of it,

346
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:57,820
 it literally, it looks like just the plane, no wings,

347
00:10:57,820 --> 00:10:59,900
 and it managed to take off and they used to-

348
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:01,220
 - And what's giving it the lift?

349
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:02,860
 - You have to roll it down a hill

350
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:04,300
 with three yorks and another.

351
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:06,880
 (all laughing)

352
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:10,100
 - It's a lot for the older generations.

353
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:11,900
 - I think it's playing it, don't explain it.

354
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:14,060
 (all laughing)

355
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:15,380
 - Yeah, what was the actual answer, please?

356
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:16,700
 - I was sort of hoping James's joke

357
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:19,180
 would make us run past that.

358
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:22,020
 - I'll always wait out the joke.

359
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:24,220
 Turn to the answer, thank you very much.

360
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:25,620
 So we don't have a flu, we have a flu.

361
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:26,460
 - You have a high flu.

362
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:27,300
 - A flu.

363
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:28,140
 - Do you wanna hear a plane we never got?

364
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:29,660
 The Lockheed flatbed.

365
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:30,500
 - Okay.

366
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:31,460
 - This is bananas.

367
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:34,260
 - Okay, so what's the thing about planes?

368
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:35,940
 So you got your two wings.

369
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:38,900
 - You're gonna have an engine underneath each one.

370
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:42,700
 - Okay, but you put everything you got in your plane, right?

371
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:44,140
 Or your people in their bags.

372
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:46,140
 There's still a load of space above them, isn't there?

373
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:46,980
 - Yeah.

374
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:47,820
 - There's still a load of head room

375
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:50,700
 that is unnecessary wasting of that tube of the plane.

376
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:51,540
 - Oh yeah.

377
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:54,980
 - So one of you had a plane which had the wings

378
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:56,500
 and it's got the head and the tail,

379
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:59,180
 but then it's just like a flatbed truck in the middle.

380
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:00,060
 It's not a tube.

381
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:00,900
 - Okay.

382
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:02,540
 - Do the people have to lie down in it?

383
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:03,540
 - It's not for people.

384
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:05,500
 - Oh, it's for people.

385
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:07,700
 - It's just for paintings by Delacroix.

386
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:10,580
 - It's for like, I don't know,

387
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:13,100
 like a big lorry or a tank or whatever,

388
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:16,380
 like something you need to move by air that just goes

389
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:17,660
 in an open top sandwich.

390
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:18,780
 - No, it's a convertible plane.

391
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:20,620
 - Stunt that down, convertible plane.

392
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:21,460
 - Cool.

393
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:23,620
 - And that was designed and tragically it was,

394
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:25,420
 I don't think it was built, it was designed in the 80s.

395
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:26,860
 The pilots get to sit in a compartment,

396
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:27,820
 but mostly it's open.

397
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:29,740
 - Yeah, otherwise your hair would get completely messed up,

398
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:30,780
 isn't it? - That's true.

399
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:32,660
 - Do you guys know about the X planes?

400
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:34,340
 - Yes, where have they gone?

401
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:35,660
 They were meant to be the future.

402
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:36,500
 - Well. - What it is,

403
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:37,500
 it's how the X men get around.

404
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:38,940
 - Yes, exactly.

405
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:39,860
 They are the future.

406
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:41,780
 And basically we only learn about them

407
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:43,260
 after they've been declassified.

408
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:46,380
 So, you know, there might be still some X planes being made,

409
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:48,300
 but we don't know about them yet, right?

410
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:50,420
 But we know about the ones which have been made

411
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:51,780
 and weren't useful.

412
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:53,820
 A lot of them were missiles.

413
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:55,260
 There was one called the stiletto,

414
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:58,500
 which looks like basically the bottom of a shoe,

415
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:00,780
 of a women's shoe, extremely thin aeroplane.

416
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:03,220
 They thought it might be able to go really, really fast.

417
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:04,500
 - Who's making all these X planes?

418
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:05,620
 - This is the US.

419
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:06,700
 - Okay. - Yeah.

420
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:07,900
 - And what's their category?

421
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:09,220
 Their secret until they're released?

422
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:10,500
 - Secret until they're released, yeah.

423
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:12,940
 So if you're making a secret sort of wacky plane

424
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:14,980
 and you're in the American military,

425
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:18,220
 dick dastardly is in charge,

426
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:21,380
 then you give them an X designation.

427
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:22,580
 - I see. - And then eventually

428
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:23,420
 some of them cloud.

429
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:28,420
 The X 43 was in 2004 and it flew at Mach 9.6.

430
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:32,140
 So at 9.6 times the speed of sound,

431
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:34,700
 it was about 7,000 miles per hour.

432
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:36,220
 - No.

433
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:40,380
 - But the engine only was able to run for 10 seconds.

434
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:42,940
 (all laughing)

435
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:45,660
 So they got that fast, but they couldn't do it for very long.

436
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:47,700
 - You still popped Paris, couldn't you?

437
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:48,700
 - That was great.

438
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:50,820
 - Can I tell you guys one really amazing thing

439
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:52,180
 about moving big stuff around?

440
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:53,180
 - Yeah.

441
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:57,140
 - Wind turbines, those big sort of arms of wind turbines,

442
00:13:57,140 --> 00:13:59,660
 you have to basically make them in one piece

443
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:01,660
 and then get them to where they need to go.

444
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:03,780
 You can't make them and then stick them together

445
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:05,580
 'cause they need to be really strong.

446
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:09,420
 And so they put them on enormous flatbed trucks, right?

447
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:11,940
 But sometimes the place where you need to put your

448
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:13,940
 wind turbine is in the countryside.

449
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:16,120
 How do you get through a little town

450
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:18,740
 with these massive wind turbine trucks?

451
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:21,500
 - Do you have to just take everything down basically?

452
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:22,780
 Like anything that goes over the street,

453
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:23,620
 any wires or anything?

454
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:24,660
 - Sometimes that would happen.

455
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:26,020
 Yeah, in the past that's had to happen

456
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:29,020
 or they've had to like make roads way wider.

457
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:32,340
 They've had to pave over the top of roundabouts

458
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:34,620
 because they can't go roundabouts.

459
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:37,220
 But they've invented a new class of vehicle

460
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:39,940
 called the self-propelled rotor blade adapter.

461
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:40,940
 And this is amazing.

462
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:43,540
 So you drive your truck and it's on a flatbed

463
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:46,660
 and then the rotor blade of the wind turbine

464
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:51,180
 can move upwards so that it's perpendicular to the ground,

465
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:53,100
 which means you can drive it much better

466
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,740
 around like tight corners.

467
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:57,580
 - It does mean you've got the biggest sale known to man.

468
00:14:57,580 --> 00:14:59,620
 (all laughing)

469
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:01,140
 - They would only do it at nighttime

470
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:02,340
 and everything's really quiet.

471
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:06,340
 But otherwise, you're knocking down like trees and.

472
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:07,180
 - I've actually seen,

473
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:08,500
 I think they sometimes don't do it at night

474
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:10,260
 'cause there's a really good video.

475
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:12,100
 Someone drive, I think it's in Hull,

476
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:13,980
 a really good video of a truck,

477
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:16,700
 which looks microscopic when you put a 100 meter,

478
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:18,860
 like wind turbines might get up to 100 meters long.

479
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:22,220
 I think this one's 70 meter long turbine blade on it

480
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:24,460
 sticking up like James says in the air.

481
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:25,820
 And then behind it,

482
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:29,100
 there's one guy walking in fluorescent gear

483
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:30,500
 with a hard hat on.

484
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:31,340
 - He's the load master.

485
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:33,420
 (all laughing)

486
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:34,860
 - Come on and go hearty together.

487
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:36,540
 (all laughing)

488
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:39,120
 (upbeat music)

489
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:44,980
 - Okay, it is time for fact number two and that is Andy.

490
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:47,100
 My fact is that Japan has just experienced

491
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:50,140
 its maximum ever number of traffic lights.

492
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:51,820
 (all laughing)

493
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:53,740
 - Is this by Royal Decree?

494
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:56,180
 - It's, yeah, it's an imperial thing.

495
00:15:56,180 --> 00:15:58,220
 They've decided they're just too darn many.

496
00:15:58,220 --> 00:15:59,060
 - No, why is this?

497
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:02,260
 Like, how can you be sure that they're not gonna add more?

498
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:03,380
 - I'm not positive,

499
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:07,980
 but barring surprising demographic shifts.

500
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:08,820
 - I see.

501
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:09,660
 - Which aren't unheard of,

502
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:11,300
 Japan will never have as many traffic lights

503
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:12,140
 as it does now.

504
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:14,300
 - Is your fact that Japan's population is going down?

505
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:18,360
 - No, that's, no, it's closely related to that fact.

506
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:19,200
 - Okay.

507
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,040
 - I'll grant you that.

508
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:20,860
 - Just joking.

509
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:21,700
 - This was a piece in the FT

510
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:25,500
 about the fact that Japan's population is going down.

511
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:28,080
 (all laughing)

512
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:31,940
 - But if you've got fewer people,

513
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:33,440
 you need fewer traffic lights.

514
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,540
 - It's basically, do you remember

515
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:37,060
 we did the thing about conveyor belts,

516
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:38,780
 that man Japanese scheme to have conveyor belts

517
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:40,620
 instead of freight lorries, you know,

518
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:42,100
 in rural bits of the country.

519
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:44,500
 Basically, many traffic lights are quite old now

520
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:47,420
 and roads in rural areas are emptying of traffic.

521
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:49,060
 So the police have just announced

522
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:50,180
 from this year more traffic lights

523
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:52,540
 will be decommissioned than newly installed.

524
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:55,140
 So the total number's going down demographics.

525
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:57,340
 It's called the 2025 problem actually in Japan,

526
00:16:57,340 --> 00:17:01,020
 which is where this massive baby boomer generation,

527
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:05,220
 they are moving from early old to old old.

528
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:06,700
 They're over 75 now.

529
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:08,620
 So they're moving into more of the,

530
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:09,900
 and that's not advanced old age,

531
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:11,740
 but you know what I mean, they're getting older.

532
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:13,540
 And that just means big changes, man.

533
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:14,780
 This is one of them, yeah?

534
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:16,200
 - Is it that they don't know how to use traffic lights

535
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,220
 anymore 'cause they're getting older?

536
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:19,500
 - No, it's more like that will lead to lots of shifts

537
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:22,420
 in terms of the amount of social care you need for people.

538
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:24,380
 If you have a big cohort of society

539
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:25,980
 who are no longer in early old age,

540
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:28,140
 but in older old age, that will lead to big things.

541
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:29,700
 And that's why they're experimenting with lots of things

542
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:32,620
 like robots in care homes and things like this.

543
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:33,460
 They're trying to solve it

544
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:34,780
 with a combination of robotics and other things.

545
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:36,500
 Mostly robots 'cause it's Japan.

546
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:37,780
 - It's not just depopulation.

547
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:40,300
 It's the fact that the traffic lights themselves,

548
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:42,700
 they have a life expectancy of 19 years.

549
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:44,180
 And so if you wanna redo them up,

550
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:47,180
 it costs about 6,000 pounds

551
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:48,940
 in order to do each traffic light.

552
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:51,260
 And they just saying, actually, let's just take them down.

553
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:54,980
 It's depopulation and old age of the lights themselves.

554
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:56,940
 - So as to your question, James,

555
00:17:56,940 --> 00:18:00,220
 if Japan suddenly goes on the bonkathon of the century

556
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:02,340
 and suddenly the population is gonna double,

557
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:06,060
 then they might consider Japanese bonkathon.

558
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:07,620
 - I love it.

559
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:09,300
 You mentioned robots.

560
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:12,020
 Robot is what a traffic light is in South Africa.

561
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:12,860
 - Beautiful.

562
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:13,700
 - What does that mean?

563
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:14,660
 - That's what they call them.

564
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:15,500
 Robots. - Really?

565
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:16,340
 - Yeah, yeah.

566
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:17,180
 - What are they called robots?

567
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:20,180
 (all laughing)

568
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:24,020
 - I think you can have the same name for two things.

569
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:24,860
 - I don't think so.

570
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:25,700
 - It might get confusing though.

571
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:26,540
 - It might be.

572
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:27,580
 They were originally called that.

573
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:31,620
 So in Johannesburg, the first one came in 1927

574
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:34,100
 and they were called robots and they still are,

575
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:36,420
 but they're quite unreliable in Joburg

576
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:39,100
 and people knock them over quite a lot.

577
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:43,380
 The Johannesburg drivers damage 81 robots a month

578
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:44,700
 and they have to replace them

579
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:47,260
 and they often replace them with quite high-tech things

580
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:50,260
 and those high-tech things often get stolen

581
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:52,900
 'cause they have lots of metal in the cables

582
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:53,740
 and stuff like that.

583
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:57,060
 They fitted loads of them with a monitoring system,

584
00:18:57,060 --> 00:18:59,220
 but the monitoring system had SIM cards in

585
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:01,460
 and people realized they could just steal the SIM cards

586
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:03,460
 and use them in their phones and make free calls.

587
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:04,300
 - Wait, what?

588
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:07,700
 - And the problem is so bad that in some cases,

589
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:10,740
 jail sentences or attacking robots can be as high

590
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:13,420
 as they are for murder in Johannesburg.

591
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:14,260
 - Wow.

592
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:15,780
 - Because they decided we're gonna stop this

593
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:18,060
 so we're gonna make the punishments really high.

594
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:19,220
 - That's wow.

595
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:20,220
 - Yeah, big problem.

596
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:21,700
 - That is a big problem.

597
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:24,700
 Singapore's got an interesting thing with its traffic lights.

598
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:26,620
 Depending on who's crossing the road,

599
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:30,700
 you might be stuck at a red light in your car longer

600
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:33,500
 than if someone else was crossing the road.

601
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:34,940
 Is this a riddle?

602
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:36,780
 Yeah, go for it.

603
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:38,540
 - Is it that they've got sensors to tell if it's someone

604
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:40,300
 in a wheelchair or an elderly person

605
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:41,380
 who takes longer to cross?

606
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:43,020
 - So yeah, but it's not sensors.

607
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:45,700
 This is a new thing which they're gonna slowly spread out

608
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:46,740
 through all of Singapore,

609
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:49,100
 which is if an elderly person is trying to cross the road,

610
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:52,260
 they have a car, which is kind of like a pensioner's card,

611
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:55,100
 which they tap onto the side,

612
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:57,820
 which tells the signal that there's an old person crossing

613
00:19:57,820 --> 00:20:01,140
 and they get an additional 13 seconds to cross the road.

614
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:02,460
 - I think that's such a good idea.

615
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:04,540
 I spend a lot of time with pedestrian crossings thinking,

616
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:07,380
 this is way too little time if you're really old.

617
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:09,940
 Sometimes I can even only just get across.

618
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:12,020
 And especially if you're not there at the very start.

619
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:12,860
 - Yeah.

620
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:13,700
 - If you're an older person, you're like,

621
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:15,180
 I'm not gonna start unless I was there at the beginning.

622
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:16,020
 - Yeah.

623
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:17,580
 - Some of the roads in Singapore quite long as well.

624
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:18,620
 - Yeah, quite wide.

625
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:19,460
 - They're quite wide.

626
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:20,620
 Yeah, they have lots of lanes.

627
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:22,300
 Like almost as wide as Amosways,

628
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:23,820
 but they're just normal A roads.

629
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:25,860
 - God imagine getting to sort of the middle

630
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:27,500
 of a 12-lane road,

631
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:30,220
 realizing and looking behind and in front and thinking,

632
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:31,060
 - Surely tap my car.

633
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:31,900
 - Did you tap my car?

634
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:33,220
 - Did you tap, darling?

635
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:34,260
 I thought you tapped.

636
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:35,100
 - You did have to.

637
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:38,060
 - People in wheelchairs are much likely

638
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:39,580
 to be in traffic-related accidents,

639
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:41,180
 partly 'cause they might take a bit longer to cross,

640
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:43,140
 but also partly because they're way less visible

641
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:44,420
 'cause you're at a lower height.

642
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:46,420
 So in Vienna, the cameras can detect that

643
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:48,700
 and they sort of work out with 99% accuracy

644
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:50,820
 whether you want to cross the road or not.

645
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:51,660
 - How cool is that?

646
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:53,420
 - I honestly thought we had similar things in London,

647
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:54,260
 I must say.

648
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:55,620
 Like there's one near our house

649
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:57,220
 which gets you across to the park.

650
00:20:57,220 --> 00:20:59,700
 And I swear when people are slowly going across it,

651
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:01,020
 it stays on for longer.

652
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:01,860
 - Oh, really?

653
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:02,980
 - You've got to get out there with your stopwatch, right?

654
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:05,220
 - I know, I'm gonna get out.

655
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:07,660
 - Did you know, outrage of outrage that,

656
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:09,420
 well, first of all, I've always been fascinated

657
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:10,860
 by traffic-like technology.

658
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:12,340
 And I've like Googled this loads before,

659
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:13,620
 like how they're all coordinated,

660
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:15,820
 how many lights are rigged up to the same system.

661
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:17,780
 'Cause you know, they all seem to change

662
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:19,220
 in coordination with each other.

663
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:21,180
 You have something called a green wave.

664
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:22,260
 Do you know what green wave is?

665
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:24,300
 - Well, I came back from the airport the other day

666
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:27,340
 and I was driving from Stanstead into central London

667
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:29,780
 and it felt like every single light was on green.

668
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:31,100
 I just got so lucky.

669
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:32,740
 - That's 'cause you'd had your crisps

670
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:33,820
 that you were in a good mood.

671
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:35,340
 (all laughing)

672
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:38,180
 - But what I thought is, if you hit one green,

673
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:39,820
 does that mean you're gonna hit all the greens?

674
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:41,220
 'Cause you're just going at the right pace.

675
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:42,220
 - Well, it usually depends on whether

676
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:43,500
 you're in a row of traffic.

677
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:44,340
 - Well, no one was there.

678
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:45,180
 It's the middle of the night.

679
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:46,020
 - Okay, well, that's very weird.

680
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:46,860
 And you just got lucky, I think.

681
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:47,700
 (all laughing)

682
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:48,900
 - Well, if it was the middle of the light,

683
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:50,260
 they'd just have them on green

684
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:52,140
 unless another car comes.

685
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:53,500
 But the green wave is basically-

686
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:56,460
 - Well, you're driving a wind turbine blade at the time.

687
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:58,780
 (all laughing)

688
00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:01,500
 - This is when loads of lights along the same route,

689
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:03,180
 along the same straight stretch of road

690
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:05,380
 are coordinated to go green one after the other

691
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:06,680
 to stop cars stopping.

692
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:09,540
 Now, usually it only works if you're in a row of traffic

693
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:11,140
 because environmentally it's much more friendly

694
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:13,980
 to not have lots of cars stopping and starting

695
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:15,500
 'cause when engines stop and start,

696
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:16,820
 that's worse for the environment.

697
00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:19,420
 So, people say that if you are in a green wave,

698
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:21,060
 if you catch a green wave,

699
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:22,720
 then a bit like getting in a slipstream,

700
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,900
 you've got to stay close to the car in front.

701
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:26,620
 Not too close, but close enough

702
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:28,580
 that you don't break the green wave

703
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:29,940
 so that you can get through all the greens.

704
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:31,860
 'Cause if suddenly you let enough distance

705
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:33,540
 between you and the car in front happen,

706
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:35,060
 then the light will go red.

707
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:35,900
 - Okay.

708
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:36,740
 - So-

709
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:38,740
 - So is everyone on board?

710
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:40,460
 Are you in the car going,

711
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:41,820
 "Oh my God, we're in a green wave."

712
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:42,660
 - You should be, yeah.

713
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:43,660
 - Right, and then you will-

714
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:44,700
 - Then you will think to each other.

715
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:46,900
 - Conger it along, yeah, that's pretty cool.

716
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:48,700
 - London has a thing called Scoot,

717
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:51,140
 which is smart traffic lights.

718
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:54,660
 And they can let certain cars and trucks

719
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:56,860
 and people go through depending on

720
00:22:56,860 --> 00:22:58,820
 what's best for the environment.

721
00:22:58,820 --> 00:23:01,340
 So if there's like some really big, heavy goods vehicles

722
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:02,420
 that are gonna go through London,

723
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:04,420
 they think we don't want to stay in central London

724
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:05,460
 and clogging up the air.

725
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:07,740
 So we're gonna kind of give them a bit of a free run

726
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:09,260
 on the green lights.

727
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:11,260
 And that's using smart cameras

728
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:13,180
 and all that kind of stuff that they can do that.

729
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:14,020
 - That's so cool.

730
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:16,020
 - I know, and they have a similar one in Amsterdam,

731
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:17,580
 which can talk to your phone.

732
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:22,900
 They can give cyclist priority when it's raining.

733
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:23,740
 - Wow.

734
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:25,620
 - That's so amazing, yeah.

735
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:28,260
 - The Dutch are so far ahead of the day.

736
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:29,740
 - They're kind of thinking to stop this.

737
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:31,340
 In fact, they might have recently stopped it

738
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:33,620
 because they hadn't really thought about the privacy risks

739
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:35,900
 of being able to see where everyone's going all the time.

740
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:37,060
 - What's the harm?

741
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:38,620
 - A few people have complained about it.

742
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:39,900
 So I'm not sure if it's still going,

743
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:41,260
 but for a while that was definitely the case.

744
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:43,700
 - There's people who were cycling home from their lover's house.

745
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:44,540
 And that's how they got busted.

746
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:47,060
 - I don't know from the big Dutch bonkathon.

747
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:48,380
 - Well, I just wonder if that's,

748
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:51,940
 if there's a hidden sort of like air traffic control system

749
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:53,140
 that's used for say like,

750
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:54,180
 if there's a major incident

751
00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:55,860
 and you need ambulances to get through.

752
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:57,180
 - In America they have that.

753
00:23:57,180 --> 00:23:58,500
 But in the UK, we don't have it

754
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:00,780
 because ambulances just go through red lights.

755
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:02,060
 So we don't need it.

756
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:04,500
 - But there is, again, in the Netherlands,

757
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:07,340
 there's a traffic light system in,

758
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:08,700
 oh gosh, I can pronounce it wrong,

759
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:12,020
 Hertogenbosch, which has all these detection loops

760
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:15,020
 like plugged into the whole town software.

761
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:17,780
 So all the city buses have these transponders on

762
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:19,020
 which talk to the junctions.

763
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:20,740
 If the bus is running on time,

764
00:24:20,740 --> 00:24:21,780
 the light works as normal.

765
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:23,300
 If the bus is running late,

766
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:26,180
 the lights change to give the bus priority.

767
00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:27,700
 And if the bus is early, the light says,

768
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:28,540
 yeah, you can hold on.

769
00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:29,900
 - The light just stops the bus for the sake of it.

770
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:31,700
 - It stops the bus and lets the other traffic through first.

771
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:34,020
 - Well, this is the explosive thing.

772
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:35,940
 I realized about this country,

773
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:37,940
 is that, yeah, we don't have it with emergency vehicles,

774
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:39,580
 whereas America does, which, and I should say,

775
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:41,460
 'cause I read so many forums with ambulance people saying,

776
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:43,820
 we never go through red lights unless it's safe.

777
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:45,660
 So, you know, it was really nilly.

778
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:47,100
 - Of course we don't.

779
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:48,820
 - But, no, no, of course not.

780
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:50,580
 - We're gonna need a few more ambulances out there.

781
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:54,420
 We've got them in great time, but.

782
00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:58,780
 - We have left a trail of destruction.

783
00:24:58,780 --> 00:25:00,540
 But, you know, who can't override red lights

784
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:03,980
 whenever they want, the buses in this country

785
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:05,180
 - It's so cool.

786
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:06,020
 - What?

787
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:08,140
 - So, if a bus has the appropriate technology,

788
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:09,460
 which is the bus radio link.

789
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:11,100
 - I think you're thinking of cyclists.

790
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:13,340
 (laughing)

791
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:16,260
 You're always hopping on the back of passing cyclists

792
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:17,580
 and tapping them with your oyster card

793
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:20,380
 but staying on until you've reached your destination.

794
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:22,740
 - This is true.

795
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:25,460
 They have certain different bits of tech that come to it,

796
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:28,260
 but one of them is bus priority radio link,

797
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:29,660
 which communicates with traffic lights.

798
00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:31,660
 So, if you're on the bus, you have this radio link

799
00:25:31,660 --> 00:25:34,060
 that says, I'm coming along, I'm a bus,

800
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:35,900
 let the light stay green for me

801
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:37,220
 and the light will stay green for the bus.

802
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:39,460
 'Cause again, it's better because buses are more efficient,

803
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:40,620
 they're carrying more people,

804
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:42,740
 bad for the environment for them to stop and start.

805
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:43,900
 Sometimes you'll see,

806
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:45,540
 and I really want to see one of these now,

807
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:48,300
 a sensor on the road before traffic lights

808
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:49,860
 and it's a bus sensor.

809
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:51,180
 And I think they're often at the bus stop

810
00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:53,660
 just before the lights on the bus stop

811
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:55,420
 and it senses that a bus has gone past

812
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:57,860
 and it relays information to the traffic light saying,

813
00:25:57,860 --> 00:25:59,700
 if you're on green, stay on green for a bit longer

814
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:02,780
 'cause bus is coming, let him through.

815
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:04,900
 These buses are getting away with murder.

816
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:08,740
 Police cars are there, sitting in it for lights.

817
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:10,260
 - Such a miserable response.

818
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:12,340
 I am being cheated here by this bus

819
00:26:12,340 --> 00:26:14,060
 getting through efficiently.

820
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:16,500
 - My Ferrari, happy to see it idling.

821
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:19,700
 - Okay, which is better?

822
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:23,380
 Reversing into a parking space or going in face first?

823
00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:24,940
 - I have this argument with my husband all the time.

824
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:26,820
 - I always go in face first.

825
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:29,140
 - I was reverse, I wonder if it's a gender thing.

826
00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:32,540
 - I don't believe it's easier to reverse into any spot.

827
00:26:32,540 --> 00:26:35,020
 - All right, you're doing the challenge.

828
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:38,580
 - Because then I reverse coming out, don't I?

829
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:41,100
 - We both have to reverse at some stage.

830
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:43,860
 Although my dream is I drive in straight

831
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:45,260
 and then the person in front of me

832
00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:46,460
 and the other parking spot leaves

833
00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:49,260
 and I can just go straight through the parking spots.

834
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:51,140
 - That's a great day when that happens.

835
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:53,260
 I knew this would be a hot button topic.

836
00:26:53,260 --> 00:26:54,380
 And if you're listening at home

837
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:56,180
 and you've got opinions about whether you reverse

838
00:26:56,180 --> 00:26:57,020
 it or go face first.

839
00:26:57,020 --> 00:26:58,900
 - Okay, here's another reason why you should do

840
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:00,020
 what Anna does.

841
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:02,620
 Reversing out of a parking space is more dangerous

842
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:04,140
 because there are people walking around there.

843
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:04,980
 - Bingo.

844
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:06,020
 - Whereas it's unlikely there's someone walking

845
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:06,980
 in your parking spot.

846
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:07,860
 - Exactly that.

847
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:10,940
 So there is a writer called Tom Vanderbilt

848
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:12,780
 who's an American traffic writer.

849
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:15,700
 And basically, particularly in America,

850
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:16,900
 which is where he's focused on,

851
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:19,660
 there are loads of crashes, you know,

852
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:21,180
 some of them fatal in car parks.

853
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:22,620
 And it's because people,

854
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:23,700
 and it's also because American cars

855
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:25,780
 are way bigger than European ones.

856
00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:27,720
 People just get in, they reverse out,

857
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:29,580
 visibility's much reduced.

858
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:33,500
 However, there are some places where it is illegal

859
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:36,140
 in America to reverse into a parking space.

860
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:36,980
 - Really?

861
00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:37,820
 - What?

862
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:38,660
 - I know.

863
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:41,220
 - There's a city in California called San Luis Obispo,

864
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:42,300
 I'm sure I'm saying that wrong too,

865
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:44,940
 which has made it illegal to reverse into a space.

866
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:45,780
 I don't know.

867
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:46,860
 - Everyone who lives there is a woman

868
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:48,740
 in a 1950s sexist joke, aren't they?

869
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:51,260
 So it's just chaos.

870
00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:53,140
 - It's clearly safer to do the opposite

871
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:55,060
 of the law in this place, which is nuts.

872
00:27:55,060 --> 00:27:56,260
 - It must be the fights, right?

873
00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:58,560
 Because you, in order to reverse it,

874
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:00,420
 you have to pass the spot.

875
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:03,360
 And then it's like you've changed your mind,

876
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:04,720
 they're going, actually, I'm gonna,

877
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:08,280
 and they're going, no, I'm a front parker.

878
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:09,800
 Yeah, I think that's probably it.

879
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:10,640
 - Can I say one last thing

880
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:13,520
 about an effect of traffic changes?

881
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:18,520
 So, New York City has just a little bit of glamour,

882
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:20,920
 has just introduced a congestion charge.

883
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:21,760
 - Okay.

884
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,640
 - Yeah, very late.

885
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:26,420
 London had it about, what, 15, 20 years ago, you know?

886
00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:27,540
 - Well, Durham had it before that.

887
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:28,860
 So, yeah. - Did it?

888
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:29,700
 Oh, nice, okay.

889
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:30,780
 Well, New York has finally caught up

890
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:31,980
 with Swing and Durham

891
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:33,800
 and brought in a congestion charge.

892
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:36,300
 And it's like, it's only a month or two in,

893
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:39,300
 and it's, you know, politically sort of much vexed

894
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:40,140
 'cause some people are saying,

895
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:41,740
 "Oh, it's terrible, it's woke, blah, blah, blah."

896
00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:43,620
 But it's cut down traffic a massive amount.

897
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:45,500
 Like, it's just journeys are much smoother now.

898
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:47,500
 But the other weird effect it's had,

899
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:51,300
 it's cut down another thing that's common in New York.

900
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:52,300
 What's it called then? - Honking.

901
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:53,140
 - Honking.

902
00:28:53,140 --> 00:28:54,880
 - Oh, very good. - Okay.

903
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:57,880
 Honk-related complaints are down 70%.

904
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:59,880
 - Oh, really? - 70%.

905
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:01,520
 - Wow. - Is that just car honking?

906
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:03,060
 Or is it also people pretending

907
00:29:03,060 --> 00:29:04,460
 to grab people's breasts?

908
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:05,800
 (laughing)

909
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:07,920
 - Well, no, actually, those are up hugely, sadly.

910
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:09,140
 (laughing)

911
00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:11,320
 I also load the number of instances of people saying,

912
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:12,640
 "I'm walking here."

913
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:13,960
 - Oh, that's to cars?

914
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:16,340
 - That's tragically down, 94%, really sad.

915
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:18,920
 (upbeat music)

916
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:24,800
 - Okay, it is time for fact number three and that is James.

917
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:27,800
 - Okay, my fact this week is that bacteria eat clouds.

918
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:30,480
 (laughing)

919
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:32,560
 So it turns out, up in the sky,

920
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:35,680
 there's a lot of stuff living up there, lots of stuff.

921
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:38,860
 And a lot of it is very small.

922
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:43,600
 So, you know, fungal spores, viruses, and bacteria.

923
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:46,160
 And the bacteria, how they can live up there for so long

924
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:50,520
 is that they get their energy from the little bits

925
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:51,720
 that make clouds.

926
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:54,480
 So, if you think about it, a cloud is made out of water,

927
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:55,560
 right? - Mm-hmm.

928
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:57,880
 - But the water can't just stay up there by itself.

929
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:59,400
 It needs to get around something.

930
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:01,400
 So there's little bits of dust.

931
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:04,120
 There might be little bits of dead animals up there,

932
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:07,360
 little bits of, you know, dead fungal spores,

933
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:08,200
 something like that.

934
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:09,040
 - Little bits of dead animals,

935
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:09,880
 like the leg of a rabbit.

936
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:11,720
 (laughing)

937
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:14,480
 - The roadkill that the planes hit on there up there.

938
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:15,380
 (laughing)

939
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:16,360
 - Tiny cellular.

940
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:18,160
 - I meant tiny cellular things, yeah,

941
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:20,960
 as opposed to a trunk of an elephant.

942
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:23,400
 But yeah, so that stuff might be made of carbon,

943
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:26,880
 and the bacteria can use this carbon

944
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:30,880
 to make a molecule called adenosine triphosphate, or ATP,

945
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,280
 which is basically what we all use,

946
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:34,080
 what all living-- - How mitochondria?

947
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:36,960
 - Yeah, all living things use it to create energy,

948
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:39,640
 and they get theirs from this stuff that's in clouds.

949
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:40,640
 - Yeah, cool. - It's sort of,

950
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:43,400
 I always thought these are nucleators,

951
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:44,760
 the little bits that clouds gather around it.

952
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:47,520
 I always thought they were mainly dust and bits of earth,

953
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:49,960
 and basically water attaches them,

954
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:52,080
 forms ice around them, and that's clouds.

955
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:55,120
 But actually, up to 100% of them in some places,

956
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:56,680
 and the vast majority are biological.

957
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:59,000
 So it's largely the corpses of other bacteria

958
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,640
 that bacteria are eating.

959
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:04,000
 - Yeah, and a lot of dust is, like,

960
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,040
 comes from bacteria or-- - Yeah, used to be alive.

961
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:08,000
 - It's wild to think, though, that when it rains,

962
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,840
 there's an estimate that says a single square meter

963
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:13,440
 of ground gets pelted with 100 million bacteria

964
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:14,720
 during every hour of rainstorm.

965
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:16,440
 - Yeah, I-- - So you're being rained

966
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:18,080
 on by bacteria. - 'Cause I don't really like

967
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:21,400
 using umbrellas, 'cause I feel like it's a bit soft,

968
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:24,040
 and so I can always go out in the rain,

969
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:25,440
 and I'm just kind of happy to get wet,

970
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:26,640
 and also, 'cause I'm from Bolton,

971
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:29,320
 I feel like it reminds me of home when it rains.

972
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:30,600
 - Yeah, right. - But now that I know

973
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:32,240
 all that bacteria is coming down as well,

974
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:34,040
 I feel like I might have to use an umbrella.

975
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:35,440
 - Oh, you're being mad at me. - But now you know

976
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:37,480
 you're being bombarded with fungal spores.

977
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:38,320
 - I know. - Yeah.

978
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:40,920
 - Yeah, you've got a real two mixed signals coming in there.

979
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:41,800
 That's so huge, James.

980
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:44,680
 I recently considered buying a second umbrella stand.

981
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:47,440
 (laughing)

982
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:49,200
 - Honestly, if anyone listening wants to know

983
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,600
 the difference between me and Abby,

984
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:51,920
 that pretty much sums us up.

985
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:53,240
 (laughing)

986
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:55,040
 - It's pretty wild, though, that it's not just the rain,

987
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:58,040
 that I grew up by the beaches in Australia.

988
00:31:58,040 --> 00:32:02,080
 Every crashing wave was pumping bacteria into my face.

989
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:04,320
 I just didn't know that. - It's crazy, 'cause I always go

990
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:06,560
 swimming completely naked, 'cause I think if you wear

991
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:09,720
 a swimsuit, that's soft. (laughing)

992
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:11,280
 - Now you're burkini, aren't you?

993
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:14,640
 - I read a piece, which I'm sure you guys all did,

994
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:17,640
 which was printed in microbiology today in 2005.

995
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:19,960
 - I'd read it before. (laughing)

996
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:20,920
 I'm really visited.

997
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:22,960
 - This was a fantastic, I just wanted to give a shout out

998
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:23,880
 to Dale Griffin.

999
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:25,920
 I don't know if he's still training or still listening,

1000
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:29,200
 but it's about soil moving across the earth every year.

1001
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:30,640
 I just want to read you the quote.

1002
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:32,960
 The current estimate of the soil moving some distance

1003
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:34,280
 in the earth's atmosphere each year

1004
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:38,480
 is approximately three billion metric tons.

1005
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:42,640
 If that was converted into 1964 Volkswagen Beetles,

1006
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:44,200
 based on weight and dimensions,

1007
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:45,920
 there would be enough beetles to create

1008
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:48,960
 a 42 kilometer tall tower with base area equivalent

1009
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:51,720
 to the walled city of Chester, UK.

1010
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:53,720
 - Oh my God. (laughing)

1011
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:55,760
 - Mate. - So, hang on.

1012
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:59,280
 - So think about that. (laughing)

1013
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:01,320
 - I'm struggling to pick that. - So the amount of soil--

1014
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:02,920
 - Did we need the beetles in there?

1015
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:05,000
 Couldn't we just have the soil making the tower?

1016
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,160
 - No, no, no, because the soil is denser than beetles.

1017
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:10,000
 The soil is converted, three billion tons of soil,

1018
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
 converting to three billion tons of Volkswagen Beetles.

1019
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,440
 You can't stay inside of a Volkswagen Beetle

1020
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:15,560
 is not full of soil.

1021
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:17,320
 - No, not unless you've been doing

1022
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:19,640
 some very heavy driving. (laughing)

1023
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:22,160
 - Interesting, okay, well, I say interesting.

1024
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:25,040
 It's a cool tower, yeah. (laughing)

1025
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:26,600
 - Do we need Chester any more?

1026
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:29,480
 Wouldn't it be better to have a 42 kilometer tall tower?

1027
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:32,120
 - Tea hailstorms, you know about these?

1028
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:34,200
 - No. - Tea plantations?

1029
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:35,240
 - Yes. - Oh.

1030
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:37,920
 - They're more common hailstorms over tea plantations.

1031
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:40,960
 And it was this really big mystery in 1979.

1032
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:42,600
 There was a scientist in Kenya

1033
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:45,200
 who was aware that the world record of hailstorms

1034
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,680
 was on Kenyan tea plantations.

1035
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:49,080
 They got 132 days of them a year.

1036
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:50,320
 - Wow.

1037
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:52,640
 - Which is a lot of hail and didn't know why.

1038
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,920
 And it turns out it's all the tea pickers fault.

1039
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:56,960
 Basically, as they walk through the tea plantation

1040
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:59,480
 picking the tea, they kick up bits of leaf,

1041
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:01,320
 bits of dead tea leaf into the air.

1042
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:03,320
 And there's a bacteria in tea leaf

1043
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:06,080
 that attaches itself to the leaves as they rot

1044
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:08,480
 and they're flawless hail nucleators.

1045
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:11,240
 So, as you kick up the tea leaves into the air,

1046
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:12,800
 you free up these bacteria,

1047
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,120
 they go straight up into the air,

1048
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:15,600
 and they hail down again.

1049
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:17,120
 - Incredible. - Does it damage the tea?

1050
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:18,080
 - Must do, right?

1051
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:18,920
 - It seems like it would,

1052
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:20,000
 but it's not like they're constantly having

1053
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,600
 to move the tea plantations to escape the hailstorms, so.

1054
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:24,880
 - There's a scientist writer called,

1055
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:25,880
 I think he's called Zimmer,

1056
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:27,240
 who's writing a lot about- - Kazema.

1057
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:29,480
 - Kazema, and he writes a lot about these things

1058
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:33,400
 which are collectively aeroplankton is the term for them.

1059
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:37,600
 And it contributes a huge amount to the circle of life.

1060
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:41,400
 So, there's a bacteria called Pseudomonas,

1061
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:43,880
 and it's very good at turning water to ice

1062
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:45,720
 or helping water turn to ice.

1063
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:48,240
 And so, when a plant is covered in this stuff on the ground

1064
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:50,720
 with these bacteria and rain lands,

1065
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:53,660
 the Pseudomonas bacteria turn the water twice,

1066
00:34:53,660 --> 00:34:55,200
 the leaf cracks open,

1067
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:57,040
 and the bacteria can then get inside the leaf,

1068
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:57,880
 which is what it's trying to do,

1069
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:59,920
 it's trying to feed on the leaf.

1070
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:02,000
 So, that's what the bacteria's function is,

1071
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,480
 and it sort of damages the plant.

1072
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:07,480
 But, clouds containing those bacteria rain more,

1073
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:11,000
 and it might be that that helps plants grow

1074
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,960
 because plants need rain to grow.

1075
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:15,040
 So, actually, everyone's helping everyone in this world.

1076
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:17,600
 - So, they're kind of happy to have this little bacteria

1077
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:18,800
 cracking open their leaves,

1078
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,040
 'cause they know by doing that,

1079
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:21,160
 they're gonna get more rain.

1080
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:22,000
 - Exactly.

1081
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:22,840
 And so, the thing is,

1082
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:26,800
 there are these kind of bacteria motorways in the sky,

1083
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:27,880
 which is mapped.

1084
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:28,720
 These kind of-

1085
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:29,840
 - They're traffic light controlled,

1086
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:31,800
 or is it like a roundabout way system?

1087
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:32,640
 - Well, there's this thing,

1088
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:34,440
 the environment is called the Aerobiome.

1089
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:37,960
 Like, outdoor above us is the Aerobiome.

1090
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:41,280
 So, in cities, the Aerobiome is less diverse,

1091
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:42,240
 and there are fewer microbes,

1092
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:43,760
 and then the countryside loads more microbes

1093
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:44,840
 in the countryside,

1094
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:46,920
 and maybe this affects whether you get asthma,

1095
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:47,920
 you know, the environment you live in,

1096
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:50,000
 whether you breathe in more or fewer,

1097
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,840
 all different kinds of these things sort of affects that.

1098
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:55,080
 But, some scientists think that the 2001

1099
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:56,920
 foot and mouth outbreak in the UK,

1100
00:35:56,920 --> 00:36:00,760
 which was cattle, livestock foot and mouth, not human one,

1101
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:03,360
 they think it might've been due to a storm in North Africa,

1102
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:05,560
 which may have carried spores north,

1103
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:07,040
 because a week after that storm,

1104
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,560
 cases of foot and mouth started happening.

1105
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:09,400
 So-

1106
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:10,240
 - How interesting.

1107
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:11,080
 - Could be that.

1108
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:12,160
 - And that's the Sahara, I think, wasn't it?

1109
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:14,680
 Which gets blamed for a lot of stuff being carried.

1110
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:16,000
 I think it was from there that they thought

1111
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,480
 it might have come.

1112
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:19,840
 'Cause similarly, I think we've talked before

1113
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:23,720
 about how a lot of the sand in the Caribbean

1114
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:25,600
 is blown over from the Sahara,

1115
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:28,240
 and there was this major coral disease in 1999,

1116
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:30,800
 which killed off loads of Caribbean coral.

1117
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:34,160
 It was a fungus called Aspergillus sidae,

1118
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:36,960
 and it happened to coincide with all these dust storms

1119
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:40,280
 in the Sahara, and this fungus lived in the Sahara Desert,

1120
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:43,040
 been picked up, blown all the way over to the Caribbean,

1121
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:45,360
 killed a bunch of coral, bloody Sahara Desert.

1122
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:46,400
 - I read something about this,

1123
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:48,400
 which I don't have in my notes, 'cause it was years ago,

1124
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:51,880
 but I think there's an underwater cave in the Caribbean,

1125
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:56,240
 which is one of the best places to study old sand

1126
00:36:56,240 --> 00:37:00,200
 from the Sahara, because it flies over there.

1127
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:03,200
 It hits the water, it goes down, it gets into this cave,

1128
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:04,600
 and it's kind of stuck there,

1129
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:06,480
 and no one can contaminate it or anything,

1130
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:08,800
 and I think it's called the Dam Cave.

1131
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:09,640
 - Oh, wow.

1132
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:11,840
 - I think, from memory.

1133
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:14,720
 - That feels like an enterprising scientist has said,

1134
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:16,320
 "Well, I need to study the Sahara,

1135
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:18,760
 "but I'm going to need to study from the Caribbean."

1136
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:21,520
 (laughing)

1137
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:22,560
 And that's incredible.

1138
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:23,480
 - I think that's true.

1139
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:24,480
 - That is so good.

1140
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:25,640
 - The Dam Cave sounds like something

1141
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:27,440
 so much more disgusting than that, actually.

1142
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:28,280
 - It's like a man cave.

1143
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:29,120
 - No offense.

1144
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:29,960
 - It's weird.

1145
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:32,080
 I always think you're like superhero back cave.

1146
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:32,920
 - That's where I went.

1147
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:34,720
 - You went straight for the Dirty Magazines.

1148
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:35,800
 - Yeah.

1149
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:39,480
 - I was actually thinking of rotting Nessie corpses and stuff.

1150
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:40,800
 (laughing)

1151
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,720
 - With me just wanking in the corner.

1152
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:45,000
 (laughing)

1153
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,560
 - There's no need for that.

1154
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:48,920
 - That's what my wife said.

1155
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:50,200
 (laughing)

1156
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:52,780
 (upbeat music)

1157
00:37:52,780 --> 00:37:57,440
 - Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show,

1158
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:58,840
 and that is my fact.

1159
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:01,640
 My fact this week is that number one selling singer,

1160
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:03,320
 Sabrina Carpenter,

1161
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:06,960
 is the niece of another number one selling singer,

1162
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:08,100
 Bart Simpson.

1163
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:10,320
 - Wow.

1164
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:11,480
 - It's a confusing fact, 'cause much like me,

1165
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:13,840
 none of you would have heard of this Sabrina Carpenter,

1166
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:15,160
 and you won't know the Bart Simpson,

1167
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:16,000
 who's the leading singer.

1168
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:16,840
 - Who's the Bart Simpson fellow?

1169
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:18,480
 (laughing)

1170
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:20,640
 Okay, so a lot of people will know

1171
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:22,800
 that Sabrina Carpenter is one of the biggest pop stars

1172
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,360
 in the world right now,

1173
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:27,520
 and she has had a bunch of singles

1174
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:28,920
 that have gone to number one.

1175
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:31,160
 Mia Espresso, for example, is one,

1176
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:36,240
 and it turns out that her auntie is Nancy Cartwright,

1177
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:38,280
 the voice of Bart Simpson,

1178
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:40,160
 who herself had a number one hit,

1179
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:42,000
 would do the Bartman.

1180
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,760
 - Can I just say, I read someone on Reddit,

1181
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:46,680
 someone called Blamennixson,

1182
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:50,160
 saying that that makes Nancy Cartwright a carpenter aunt.

1183
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:51,120
 (laughing)

1184
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:52,480
 - 'Cause she's called Sabrina Carpenter.

1185
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:55,280
 - And Carpenter aunties, and David for Species of Ant.

1186
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:56,120
 - Nice, that's good.

1187
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:57,520
 - That's pretty good.

1188
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:59,560
 - Oh, and Anne is a Northern pronunciation of aunt.

1189
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:00,680
 - Yes. - Yes.

1190
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:01,520
 - Got it, thank you.

1191
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:02,680
 That was the missing link I needed.

1192
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:03,840
 - I just thought it was a good joke,

1193
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:05,760
 but not good enough that I was gonna claim it myself.

1194
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,480
 (laughing)

1195
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:08,520
 - You thought you'd buy the kite.

1196
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:09,960
 You could always edit out the Reddit bit

1197
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:12,000
 if it goes really well.

1198
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,520
 - Are you a fan of Sabrina Carpenter?

1199
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:14,360
 - Huge fan.

1200
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:15,200
 - I thought you would be,

1201
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,920
 'cause she's a big fan of Moss.

1202
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:17,960
 (gasping)

1203
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:20,360
 The album cover of her last but one album,

1204
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:21,480
 "Email So I Can't Send,"

1205
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:24,040
 was inspired by old photos of Kate Moss.

1206
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:26,800
 (laughing)

1207
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:29,040
 - So who was it, was it someone from Reddit as well?

1208
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:29,880
 - It's old mine.

1209
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:31,800
 (laughing)

1210
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:32,800
 - Well, you have me going there.

1211
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:35,040
 - I really like Sabrina Carpenter.

1212
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:35,880
 - I think she's great as well.

1213
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:37,160
 - I actually think you would like her,

1214
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:40,560
 'cause who was the person we spoke about who sang--

1215
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:42,040
 - Oh, it's my party.

1216
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:43,120
 - It's my party. - It's Leslie Gore.

1217
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:45,720
 - Yeah, I think of her as a modern day Leslie Gore.

1218
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:47,440
 - Oh, wow. - Her song, "Please, Peace, Please,"

1219
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:50,000
 I reckon is pretty much the modern version of that song.

1220
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
 - I'm always open to new talent.

1221
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,440
 - I'll give this girl a go.

1222
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:55,880
 I'll give her a go and see if maybe we can help her.

1223
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:57,640
 - Apparently she's doing fine without me.

1224
00:39:57,640 --> 00:39:58,800
 She's doing okay.

1225
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:00,640
 - So was she the only one of the Carpenter's

1226
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:02,400
 who had a career after--

1227
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,720
 - Oh, she's not current Carpenter's sister.

1228
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:07,280
 - Yeah, she's not related to the Carpenter's.

1229
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:09,760
 She, what we've got here is two people

1230
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:12,440
 who live in the modern world and they've got me and Anna.

1231
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:13,440
 - Well, let me give you a bit of background

1232
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:15,040
 about Sabrina Carpenter.

1233
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:19,640
 So Nancy Cartwright's step-brother is David Carpenter,

1234
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:21,080
 who is Sabrina Carpenter's dad.

1235
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:24,560
 He is an x-ray servicing company member.

1236
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:25,400
 His-- - Sorry?

1237
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:26,240
 - Sorry?

1238
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:27,600
 - David Carpenter works--

1239
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:29,640
 - He's an x-ray servicing company member.

1240
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:32,160
 - Yeah, it doesn't feel very important.

1241
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:33,320
 That fact is not real.

1242
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:35,920
 - Well, I mean, you said it in the same way

1243
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:37,600
 that you would say, "He's a teacher."

1244
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:39,600
 Or, "Oh, he's a doctor."

1245
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:43,720
 He's an x-ray servicing company member.

1246
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:45,320
 Company member, right, okay.

1247
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:48,880
 - If you ever meet someone like that at a party,

1248
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:50,760
 again, you're moving on to the next person.

1249
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:51,920
 - Do you have my friend, Andy?

1250
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:54,040
 - I'm going home with the lobe muffler, that's the point.

1251
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:56,840
 (all laughing)

1252
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:58,200
 Get your big trunk, you pulled.

1253
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:00,780
 (all laughing)

1254
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:03,720
 Her mum is a chiropractor.

1255
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:06,440
 The reason I mentioned these two things,

1256
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:08,040
 the reason I mentioned it,

1257
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:09,720
 is because outside of Nancy Cartwright,

1258
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:12,240
 there's no connection to the world of entertainment.

1259
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:13,200
 - She's not a depot baby, right?

1260
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:15,640
 - Exactly, she's often accused of that

1261
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:16,960
 as a result of that connection,

1262
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:18,480
 but they don't seem to be that.

1263
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:19,960
 She started her freaking,

1264
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:21,720
 she can get all the x-rays she wants.

1265
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:22,560
 (all laughing)

1266
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:23,640
 Anytime she likes.

1267
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:27,560
 - Need your back clicked, you are in luck, my friend.

1268
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:29,480
 - She released her first single,

1269
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:32,320
 which was called, "Can't Blame a Girl for Trying,"

1270
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:34,240
 one week after fish started.

1271
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:37,200
 So she is as old as fish for one week.

1272
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:38,720
 Yeah, March 14th, 2014.

1273
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:39,560
 - We should get a watch,

1274
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:41,040
 we could have a joint birthday party.

1275
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:41,880
 - Yeah, she's still got a week

1276
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:43,320
 to catch up and be as big as us.

1277
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:44,400
 Is that what I'm saying?

1278
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:45,600
 (all laughing)

1279
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:50,560
 - She started off, she did a Miley Cyrus singing competition

1280
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:52,520
 when she was 10 years old.

1281
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:53,360
 And she's-- - We're gonna have

1282
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:54,200
 to explain to her.

1283
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:55,040
 - Oh my God.

1284
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:59,480
 - She know Billy Ray Cyrus, her dad was Billy Ray Cyrus.

1285
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:00,320
 - Right.

1286
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:03,200
 - Who worked in the musicals.

1287
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:04,520
 - He was an x-ray guy.

1288
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:05,840
 - That's right.

1289
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:07,320
 But it was like a competition

1290
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:09,760
 for Miley Cyrus fan club members,

1291
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:12,120
 but it was kind of voted for by people,

1292
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:13,800
 it was one of those early internet things.

1293
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:17,560
 And it was mentioned in loads of her local newspapers.

1294
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:19,880
 And they basically said vote for her, vote for her, vote for her.

1295
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:22,120
 So she got down to the final, like three or four people.

1296
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:23,200
 And she was only 10 years old

1297
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:25,360
 and everyone else was like older teenagers doing it.

1298
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:27,480
 - So was that when she started out,

1299
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:29,040
 when fish was--

1300
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:30,600
 - Yeah, well actually-- - That would be earlier.

1301
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:31,440
 - Oh, okay.

1302
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:32,280
 - Yeah, that was earlier.

1303
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:33,360
 And then she went on to YouTube

1304
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:34,880
 'cause she got big on this competition

1305
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:36,640
 and put a load of songs on YouTube

1306
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:38,360
 and then got massive on YouTube.

1307
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:40,440
 Then she got picked up by the Disney club or someone.

1308
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:42,160
 - Yeah, she did a show called Girl Meets World,

1309
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:44,280
 which I think was a reboot of Boy Meets World,

1310
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:46,240
 which is a big show when I was a teenager.

1311
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:48,720
 She was cast as the lead character,

1312
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:49,920
 the Lindsay Lohan character

1313
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:53,600
 and the mean girl's musical that Tina Fey did on stage.

1314
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:56,120
 So she had a bit of a career ahead of it.

1315
00:42:56,120 --> 00:42:57,280
 And then she did this.

1316
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:59,440
 - A lot of slogging away before you're an overnight success.

1317
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:00,280
 - Exactly.

1318
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:01,120
 - That's what we felt.

1319
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:02,640
 - Is this like an ad crossover swap

1320
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:05,720
 is she gonna release a song about no such thing as a bitch?

1321
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:06,720
 And that's saying for this party.

1322
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:08,280
 - Yeah, I gotta say.

1323
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:09,360
 - Come on, it's like,

1324
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:11,120
 we're not expecting any publicity back

1325
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:13,040
 from the traffic lights into Shaggy.

1326
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:15,400
 (all laughing)

1327
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:16,240
 - Nancy Cartwright.

1328
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:17,240
 - Oh yeah.

1329
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:20,320
 - Is this disappointing or am I being judgmental?

1330
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:21,600
 She's big on Scientology.

1331
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:24,240
 I know they all are, but she's really big.

1332
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:25,080
 - What do you mean they all are?

1333
00:43:25,080 --> 00:43:25,920
 - All the famous people.

1334
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:27,240
 - All the famous people.

1335
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:29,640
 (all laughing)

1336
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:31,520
 - Have you not seen the roof of Mo's cavern?

1337
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:35,800
 It's one of those big pyramid wire things that you wear.

1338
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:39,400
 - She, Cartwright was awarded in 2023,

1339
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:42,600
 the status of patron Excalibur with honors

1340
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:43,840
 by the Church of Scientology,

1341
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:45,680
 which she called the most beautiful acknowledgement

1342
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:47,920
 I've ever received in my life,

1343
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:51,240
 which I think is really weird to appreciate that.

1344
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:52,080
 'Cause the reason she's got it,

1345
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:54,520
 I assume is that she's donated $20 million

1346
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:55,920
 to the Church of Scientology.

1347
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:57,400
 - So where the Simpsons money goes?

1348
00:43:57,400 --> 00:43:58,240
 - That's where it's going.

1349
00:43:58,240 --> 00:43:59,280
 - Well, there's a lot of Simpsons money, isn't it?

1350
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:00,440
 - Yeah, absolutely.

1351
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:02,200
 I mean, this album that you're talking about down,

1352
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:05,600
 this was The Simpsons Sing the Blues released in 1990.

1353
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:07,080
 - This is the, Nancy Cartwright.

1354
00:44:07,080 --> 00:44:07,920
 - Oh, I'm sorry.

1355
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:08,760
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1356
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:09,640
 - I threw the Batman on it.

1357
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:11,160
 - Exactly, that was the first track.

1358
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:13,520
 And that sold in the UK, it's on 400,000 copies.

1359
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:14,880
 - Yeah, I remember it was absolutely Monday.

1360
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:16,640
 - Yeah, well, yeah, it went to number one here,

1361
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:18,440
 but it didn't in America, oddly.

1362
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:21,200
 And what's weird is it was only played on Sky One

1363
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:23,480
 at this point, The Simpsons in the UK.

1364
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:25,480
 So for overseas listeners, that's a sort of,

1365
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:26,320
 what do you call that?

1366
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:27,160
 - You have to pay for it.

1367
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:29,640
 - Yeah, it's a pay for channel, so quite wild.

1368
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:30,680
 - The album sounds very good.

1369
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:32,840
 It's got lots of great musicians on it.

1370
00:44:32,840 --> 00:44:34,920
 BB King, Dr. John, DJ Jazzy Jeff.

1371
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:38,280
 I mean, these are my people, I don't know if they're with.

1372
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:40,000
 - It was listed that Michael Jackson

1373
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,360
 was the composer of Do The Batman,

1374
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:42,760
 which I think we might've said on this show,

1375
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:44,520
 and I believe that's not actually true.

1376
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:45,360
 - Yes.

1377
00:44:45,360 --> 00:44:47,080
 - A guy called Brian, Brian Lauren.

1378
00:44:47,080 --> 00:44:49,640
 But it got sold two million copies in the USA.

1379
00:44:49,640 --> 00:44:51,080
 I mean, it was a really,

1380
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:54,400
 I think people forget how massive The Simpsons was.

1381
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:55,240
 - Yeah.

1382
00:44:55,240 --> 00:44:56,080
 - The biggest cartoon ever.

1383
00:44:56,080 --> 00:44:56,920
 - Yeah.

1384
00:44:56,920 --> 00:45:00,120
 - Well, until the new Chinese movie, "Nasia."

1385
00:45:00,120 --> 00:45:02,320
 - I can't take another pop-cotch reference.

1386
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:03,800
 (all laughing)

1387
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:05,840
 - It's just there's a new animated movie,

1388
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:08,000
 which is the biggest animated movie of all time.

1389
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,320
 It literally came out this week.

1390
00:45:09,320 --> 00:45:10,160
 That's it.

1391
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:11,000
 - Oh, wow.

1392
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:11,840
 - Will that be The Simpsons movie?

1393
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:12,680
 - Yeah.

1394
00:45:12,680 --> 00:45:13,520
 - Probably, yeah.

1395
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:16,360
 - Nancy Korrow, by the way, before she was Bart,

1396
00:45:16,360 --> 00:45:18,000
 she did various different roles.

1397
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,480
 So she did, in my little pony,

1398
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:22,560
 she did a voice that was quite similar to Bart Simpson.

1399
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:25,320
 But probably for me, most iconically,

1400
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:28,760
 she did the voice of, if you remember who framed Roger Rabbit,

1401
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:33,320
 there's a moment where there is a shoe being dipped

1402
00:45:33,320 --> 00:45:34,920
 into a vat of acid.

1403
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:35,960
 That's her.

1404
00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:36,800
 - Brilliant.

1405
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:37,640
 - That's Nancy Korrow.

1406
00:45:37,640 --> 00:45:39,560
 - It's quite a seminal bit of that movie.

1407
00:45:39,560 --> 00:45:40,400
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1408
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:41,960
 - I don't think that's even on a Wikipedia page.

1409
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:43,080
 You need to get that up there.

1410
00:45:43,080 --> 00:45:43,920
 (all laughing)

1411
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:44,760
 - That's funny.

1412
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:46,440
 - Guys, who's the main creator of The Simpsons

1413
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:47,280
 that comes up?

1414
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:48,120
 - Matt Groening.

1415
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:48,960
 - Groening.

1416
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:49,800
 - Groening.

1417
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:50,640
 - Groening.

1418
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:51,960
 - Not him.

1419
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:52,800
 - Sorry, it is.

1420
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:55,480
 I just can't believe I've been saying Groening all these years.

1421
00:45:55,480 --> 00:45:57,040
 You see that name so much.

1422
00:45:57,040 --> 00:45:58,520
 You think Groening is Groening.

1423
00:45:58,520 --> 00:45:59,360
 - Groening.

1424
00:45:59,360 --> 00:46:00,280
 - Do you know what his parents called?

1425
00:46:00,280 --> 00:46:01,120
 - Oh, it'll be.

1426
00:46:01,120 --> 00:46:03,000
 - Mr. and Mrs. Groening.

1427
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:04,360
 - Wouldn't it be like Homer and Marge?

1428
00:46:04,360 --> 00:46:05,200
 - It's Homer and Marge.

1429
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:07,480
 - Is it? - Yeah, yeah.

1430
00:46:07,480 --> 00:46:11,040
 - His dad's a consultant radiology company member,

1431
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:11,880
 isn't he?

1432
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:13,400
 (all laughing)

1433
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:14,240
 Yeah.

1434
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:16,960
 The effects it had in the early years was brilliant.

1435
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:17,800
 I just love all the things.

1436
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:19,360
 'Cause there was a time where The Simpsons

1437
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:20,200
 was really big in the news.

1438
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:21,240
 And I know they're still making it now,

1439
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:23,400
 but there was a time where like it prompted big headlines.

1440
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:25,960
 So in 1996, The New York Times reported

1441
00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:29,440
 that there was a mega glut of saxophony

1442
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:30,760
 happening in America.

1443
00:46:30,760 --> 00:46:32,760
 All children wanted to learn the saxophone

1444
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:33,600
 because of Lisa Simpson.

1445
00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:34,440
 - Yeah, makes sense.

1446
00:46:34,440 --> 00:46:36,920
 - Sax teachers said, they interviewed the sax teachers

1447
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:39,080
 who said, this is just, you know, it's a nightmare.

1448
00:46:39,080 --> 00:46:41,800
 They would have a whole band of saxophone students.

1449
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:44,000
 - This is like, who are we talking about last week,

1450
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,280
 the farmers who complain when they get too big a yield?

1451
00:46:46,280 --> 00:46:47,120
 - The saffron.

1452
00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:48,440
 - Yeah, the saffron farmers,

1453
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:50,240
 bloody saxophone teacher, Killjoy.

1454
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:51,920
 - Sorry, band leaders were furious about this

1455
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:54,040
 'cause they, you know, they desperately needed a piccolo

1456
00:46:54,040 --> 00:46:55,880
 and all they got was a thousand saxophones.

1457
00:46:55,880 --> 00:46:56,720
 - Ah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1458
00:46:56,720 --> 00:46:57,560
 - Yeah, that makes sense.

1459
00:46:57,560 --> 00:46:58,480
 - And they interviewed one who said,

1460
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:00,400
 also due to the fact that if you go to the movies,

1461
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:02,400
 it's always the sax playing the steamy part

1462
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:04,560
 when there's something interesting going on on the screen.

1463
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:05,400
 - Saxy.

1464
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:06,240
 - Saxy stuff.

1465
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:07,080
 - That's very cool.

1466
00:47:07,080 --> 00:47:08,760
 - Also Bill Clinton and Kenny G.

1467
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:09,600
 - Oh, yes.

1468
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:10,440
 - Oh, gosh.

1469
00:47:10,440 --> 00:47:13,240
 - The two sexiest men ever to live, sex.

1470
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:17,480
 - So the reason I said Homer and Marsh before

1471
00:47:17,480 --> 00:47:20,520
 is 'cause I do know that fact that he named all the characters

1472
00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:22,360
 after his family except for Bart,

1473
00:47:22,360 --> 00:47:24,440
 which was an anagram of brat

1474
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:27,160
 and he sort of came up with it in the moment.

1475
00:47:27,160 --> 00:47:29,880
 But I was reading up on his sister, Lisa,

1476
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:33,160
 Grainning, and she...

1477
00:47:33,160 --> 00:47:34,480
 - Scraining.

1478
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:39,480
 - Grainning, she married a man called Craig Bartlett.

1479
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:42,880
 - Which part of the radiology department?

1480
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:47,440
 - Craig Bartlett is the creator of another show

1481
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:50,280
 that's called Hey Arnold, which is a massive show.

1482
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:51,360
 - I love Hey Arnold.

1483
00:47:51,360 --> 00:47:53,480
 - Yeah, and Dinosaur Train was a more recent one,

1484
00:47:53,480 --> 00:47:55,640
 which my son grew up on.

1485
00:47:55,640 --> 00:47:59,480
 But yeah, so that is a real powerhouse of a family.

1486
00:47:59,480 --> 00:48:01,240
 A cartoon connection.

1487
00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:02,840
 - He also named a lot of characters in The Simpsons

1488
00:48:02,840 --> 00:48:04,800
 after places he knew about.

1489
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:06,800
 So he grew up in Portland, in Oregon.

1490
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:09,000
 And streets where he grew up,

1491
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,800
 and where he grew up included Flanders Street,

1492
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:13,200
 a Simpsons character.

1493
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:15,120
 Lovejoy Street, Reverend Lovejoy.

1494
00:48:15,120 --> 00:48:18,360
 And there was Burnside Street in Montgomery Park

1495
00:48:18,360 --> 00:48:20,600
 next to each other, which is Montgomery Burns.

1496
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:23,920
 And then Portland also has Ter Williger Boulevard.

1497
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:26,680
 And of course, the real name of sideshow Bob

1498
00:48:26,680 --> 00:48:29,280
 is Robert Underdunk Ter Williger.

1499
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:31,680
 But he didn't name him after it.

1500
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:33,000
 - No.

1501
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:34,680
 - Completely different person.

1502
00:48:34,680 --> 00:48:37,120
 They were interviewed once, and they named sideshow Bob

1503
00:48:37,120 --> 00:48:40,840
 after a character from the film, The 5,000 Fingers of Tea,

1504
00:48:40,840 --> 00:48:42,840
 who was called Dr. Ter Williger.

1505
00:48:42,840 --> 00:48:44,280
 And it has nothing to do with the fact

1506
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:45,560
 that also in Portland, Oregon,

1507
00:48:45,560 --> 00:48:47,280
 there's a street called Ter Williger Boulevard.

1508
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:48,320
 - That's a total coincidence.

1509
00:48:48,320 --> 00:48:49,640
 - It's apparently so.

1510
00:48:49,640 --> 00:48:51,320
 - Maggie Simpson is the baby.

1511
00:48:51,320 --> 00:48:55,040
 Her first word was Daddy.

1512
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:59,040
 And it was said by friend of the podcast, Elizabeth Taylor.

1513
00:48:59,040 --> 00:48:59,880
 - Oh.

1514
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:02,520
 - They got lots of famous people voicing it, don't they?

1515
00:49:02,520 --> 00:49:04,760
 But she had to do six takes.

1516
00:49:04,760 --> 00:49:07,520
 Because every time she did it, it came out too sexy.

1517
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:10,200
 (all laughing)

1518
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:11,040
 - Oh, God.

1519
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:13,280
 - According to producer Mike Reese,

1520
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:15,800
 he said we had to keep reminding Elizabeth Taylor

1521
00:49:15,800 --> 00:49:17,840
 that she was a baby talking to her father,

1522
00:49:17,840 --> 00:49:19,000
 not hitting on him.

1523
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:20,880
 (all laughing)

1524
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:23,400
 - Do you know who voices Maggie?

1525
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:26,680
 So, Maggie is, we just, we get the dummy sucking.

1526
00:49:26,680 --> 00:49:28,040
 - So you mean who does the dummy sucking?

1527
00:49:28,040 --> 00:49:28,880
 - Yeah.

1528
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:29,700
 - Who does the dummy sucking?

1529
00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:32,480
 - Is it also Lisa, Nancy Cartwright?

1530
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:33,320
 - Nancy Cartwright.

1531
00:49:33,320 --> 00:49:34,160
 - No, no.

1532
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:35,000
 - Is it Matt Groening?

1533
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:35,840
 - It's Matt Groening.

1534
00:49:35,840 --> 00:49:36,680
 - Is it?

1535
00:49:36,680 --> 00:49:37,520
 - Yeah.

1536
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:39,640
 - It's like it's an easy way to make a lot of money, isn't it?

1537
00:49:39,640 --> 00:49:41,600
 - I think it's like when we talked about Simon Cowell

1538
00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:44,520
 doing the cowbell just to get the credit.

1539
00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:46,920
 - It's like, I'm just going to get a credit on this.

1540
00:49:46,920 --> 00:49:48,260
 - He can't need more.

1541
00:49:48,260 --> 00:49:50,420
 - It can't be the producer of the show.

1542
00:49:50,420 --> 00:49:51,760
 It can't be the difference between him.

1543
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:53,040
 - 100% he'll get paid for that.

1544
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:53,880
 - Yeah.

1545
00:49:53,880 --> 00:49:54,720
 - That's very funny.

1546
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:56,680
 - I'm going to say that's James's opinion

1547
00:49:56,680 --> 00:49:57,920
 as to why he's doing it.

1548
00:49:57,920 --> 00:49:59,480
 - I don't believe that's his motivation.

1549
00:49:59,480 --> 00:50:01,280
 - That's why I coffin these shows sometimes

1550
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:03,760
 is to get a little extra on the back end.

1551
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:06,280
 - I'd love to start a feud with The Simpsons

1552
00:50:06,280 --> 00:50:08,160
 and then maybe they'll put us in The Simpsons

1553
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:10,180
 as some evil, I mean, no one watches that anymore.

1554
00:50:10,180 --> 00:50:13,440
 So it doesn't really matter, but there you go.

1555
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:14,280
 There's your feud.

1556
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:15,600
 - Cool.

1557
00:50:15,600 --> 00:50:16,520
 - That would be, yeah, yeah.

1558
00:50:16,520 --> 00:50:18,240
 - They used to get into great beef with people all the time

1559
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:19,320
 and they recently have had a bit.

1560
00:50:19,320 --> 00:50:20,600
 They've had a bit with Morrissey.

1561
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:21,440
 - Okay.

1562
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:22,280
 - Oh yeah.

1563
00:50:22,280 --> 00:50:23,120
 - He hates beef.

1564
00:50:23,120 --> 00:50:25,380
 (laughing)

1565
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:28,760
 - They parodied him in an episode called

1566
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:30,680
 Panic on the Streets of Springfield.

1567
00:50:30,680 --> 00:50:33,400
 They had a singer who had a quiff and was a vegan

1568
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:35,960
 and you know, they just took the Mickey a bit.

1569
00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:37,400
 That was pretty gentle.

1570
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:38,720
 And Morrissey complained,

1571
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:40,520
 "You are especially despised if your music

1572
00:50:40,520 --> 00:50:42,800
 affects people in a strong and beautiful way.

1573
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:44,640
 In fact, the worst thing you can do in 2021

1574
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:46,600
 is lend a bit of strength to the lives of others.

1575
00:50:46,600 --> 00:50:47,800
 There is no place in modern music

1576
00:50:47,800 --> 00:50:49,160
 for anyone with strong emotions.

1577
00:50:49,160 --> 00:50:50,700
 In a world obsessed with hate laws,

1578
00:50:50,700 --> 00:50:52,760
 there are none that protect me."

1579
00:50:52,760 --> 00:50:54,240
 - Hang on, was this targeted at The Simpsons?

1580
00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:55,080
 - Yes!

1581
00:50:55,080 --> 00:50:57,200
 - Okay, so the story just sounds like a generic statement.

1582
00:50:57,200 --> 00:50:58,160
 - It was a statement to The Simpsons.

1583
00:50:58,160 --> 00:50:59,320
 - It was to Dear Simpsons.

1584
00:50:59,320 --> 00:51:00,640
 And there he is.

1585
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:03,320
 - They've had high profile beef with world leaders.

1586
00:51:03,320 --> 00:51:06,520
 So they had Barbara Bush called them out saying

1587
00:51:06,520 --> 00:51:07,920
 that it wasn't a show you should watch

1588
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:09,520
 and Marge Simpson wrote a letter

1589
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:11,600
 to Barbara Bush in response saying

1590
00:51:11,600 --> 00:51:14,640
 that she actually thinks her family is a good family.

1591
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:15,960
 They've had episodes where,

1592
00:51:15,960 --> 00:51:17,520
 'cause obviously it's a global product.

1593
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:18,960
 And so there's a lot of references

1594
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:21,160
 that are gonna be not suitable for certain countries.

1595
00:51:21,160 --> 00:51:23,840
 So in China, for example, there was one episode

1596
00:51:23,840 --> 00:51:26,640
 they had to remove the line about Mao Zedong

1597
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:30,120
 being a little angel who killed 50 million people.

1598
00:51:30,120 --> 00:51:32,600
 They thought that wasn't appropriate in Japan.

1599
00:51:32,600 --> 00:51:34,360
 - Can you cut after angels too?

1600
00:51:34,360 --> 00:51:36,940
 (all laughing)

1601
00:51:36,940 --> 00:51:41,120
 - Japan, there was an episode where they had to lose a bit

1602
00:51:41,120 --> 00:51:42,360
 because--

1603
00:51:42,360 --> 00:51:44,640
 - They mentioned the massive Japanese bogathon.

1604
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:47,040
 (all laughing)

1605
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:48,760
 - Yeah, Hobotoss is the Japanese emperor

1606
00:51:48,760 --> 00:51:51,200
 into a sumo thong dumpster.

1607
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:53,120
 So in fact, that whole episode was banned.

1608
00:51:53,120 --> 00:51:54,200
 - Right.

1609
00:51:54,200 --> 00:51:58,400
 - Okay, do you think that Marge should dump Homer?

1610
00:51:58,400 --> 00:51:59,680
 - Not after all this time.

1611
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:00,520
 I think--

1612
00:52:00,520 --> 00:52:01,360
 - Oh, really?

1613
00:52:01,360 --> 00:52:03,440
 - Well, I just think once you've been in a relationship

1614
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:05,600
 for, when was my marriage?

1615
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:07,520
 Once you've been in the marriage for at least 12 years,

1616
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:09,080
 you shouldn't dump your husband.

1617
00:52:09,080 --> 00:52:10,920
 - I think, yeah.

1618
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:12,640
 I think once the kids are grown up and out of home,

1619
00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:14,560
 unfortunately, that's never happening.

1620
00:52:14,560 --> 00:52:16,880
 - Okay, I only ask because you, Gov,

1621
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:19,880
 asked their long suffering test audiences.

1622
00:52:19,880 --> 00:52:22,560
 This is 2018, yeah, all right.

1623
00:52:22,560 --> 00:52:24,920
 - I think 20 people trapped in a room.

1624
00:52:24,920 --> 00:52:27,040
 (all laughing)

1625
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:28,480
 - What did they say, the prisoners?

1626
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:29,560
 - So thank you for asking.

1627
00:52:29,560 --> 00:52:34,040
 So 14% of women said Marge should dump Homer.

1628
00:52:34,040 --> 00:52:35,840
 Only 8% of men said that,

1629
00:52:35,840 --> 00:52:37,800
 so men being a bit more forgiving.

1630
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:39,440
 - Can't believe so few of either, though.

1631
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:40,280
 - Well, you go--

1632
00:52:40,280 --> 00:52:41,120
 - He's not a good husband.

1633
00:52:41,120 --> 00:52:42,360
 - I just want to say what you've said.

1634
00:52:42,360 --> 00:52:45,160
 When asked, the majority, 52% of Simpsons fans

1635
00:52:45,160 --> 00:52:47,920
 consider Homer a man who frequently strangles his son,

1636
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:49,360
 has framed Marge for drink driving,

1637
00:52:49,360 --> 00:52:51,800
 committed bigamy, caused his father's kidneys to fail,

1638
00:52:51,800 --> 00:52:53,520
 has worked for a terrorist organization,

1639
00:52:53,520 --> 00:52:55,640
 and is frequently asleep or absent in his role overseeing

1640
00:52:55,640 --> 00:52:58,120
 safety at a nuclear power plant to be a good person.

1641
00:52:58,120 --> 00:53:01,080
 - Has he not also, like, he's definitely been to space.

1642
00:53:01,080 --> 00:53:03,000
 You must have, I bet he saved the world

1643
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:04,000
 like three or four times.

1644
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:05,600
 - Yeah, he probably has.

1645
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:07,120
 - You're saying you take the rough with this move.

1646
00:53:07,120 --> 00:53:07,960
 - Yeah.

1647
00:53:07,960 --> 00:53:09,280
 - All right, so by contrast,

1648
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:11,120
 Bart, who's escapades are far more child-like

1649
00:53:11,120 --> 00:53:13,360
 and consequence-like, is almost twice as likely

1650
00:53:13,360 --> 00:53:15,840
 to be seen as a bad person at 22%,

1651
00:53:15,840 --> 00:53:18,280
 yet Maggie, who shot Mr. Burns,

1652
00:53:18,280 --> 00:53:20,280
 is only seen as a bad person by 4%.

1653
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:21,120
 - 4%.

1654
00:53:21,120 --> 00:53:21,960
 - Sorry.

1655
00:53:21,960 --> 00:53:23,800
 - 4%.

1656
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:24,920
 - That was a big deal, wasn't it,

1657
00:53:24,920 --> 00:53:26,760
 when it was who shot Mr. Burns?

1658
00:53:26,760 --> 00:53:28,320
 Were you guys the right age for that?

1659
00:53:28,320 --> 00:53:29,560
 - I remember it was, exactly.

1660
00:53:29,560 --> 00:53:31,360
 It was like Dallas, yeah, JR.

1661
00:53:31,360 --> 00:53:33,160
 - Well, you guys weren't old enough for Dallas.

1662
00:53:33,160 --> 00:53:34,640
 - No, no, no, no.

1663
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:35,960
 But yeah, I was there for it.

1664
00:53:35,960 --> 00:53:36,800
 I remember it.

1665
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:39,480
 Apparently only, they had lots of forums at the time

1666
00:53:39,480 --> 00:53:40,920
 saying, can you guess who it is?

1667
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:45,920
 And the show writers said only one person got that it was--

1668
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:47,800
 - I remember you could bet on it.

1669
00:53:47,800 --> 00:53:49,840
 And I remember, I don't think even,

1670
00:53:49,840 --> 00:53:51,360
 it was one of the options.

1671
00:53:51,360 --> 00:53:52,200
 - Wow.

1672
00:53:52,200 --> 00:53:55,560
 - But you weren't old enough to bet at that this time.

1673
00:53:55,560 --> 00:53:56,960
 But this was going on.

1674
00:53:56,960 --> 00:53:58,040
 - When did it happen?

1675
00:53:58,040 --> 00:54:00,360
 - He had a fake ID on 990 at the end of six.

1676
00:54:00,360 --> 00:54:01,320
 - I don't know, mid-90s?

1677
00:54:01,320 --> 00:54:03,120
 - Well, I was born in '78.

1678
00:54:03,120 --> 00:54:03,960
 - Okay, so it's possible.

1679
00:54:03,960 --> 00:54:05,720
 - So I was able to, in '96, I could--

1680
00:54:05,720 --> 00:54:07,320
 - I'm just picturing the scene in the betting shop.

1681
00:54:07,320 --> 00:54:09,200
 Like, a load of jaded regulars gathered around

1682
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:11,400
 the horse racing screen and a load of, like,

1683
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:13,600
 nerds in the other corner watching the Simpsons.

1684
00:54:13,600 --> 00:54:15,480
 (all laughing)

1685
00:54:15,480 --> 00:54:16,320
 And it comes in this, Maggie.

1686
00:54:16,320 --> 00:54:17,160
 Oh!

1687
00:54:17,160 --> 00:54:18,000
 (all laughing)

1688
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,240
 Get her out of your ticket.

1689
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:22,840
 One guy goes to the counter, pulls out the stacks

1690
00:54:22,840 --> 00:54:23,960
 and stacks of cash.

1691
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:25,280
 (all laughing)

1692
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:26,280
 - Isn't that Matt Groening?

1693
00:54:26,280 --> 00:54:27,600
 (all laughing)

1694
00:54:27,600 --> 00:54:30,180
 (upbeat music)

1695
00:54:30,180 --> 00:54:33,960
 - Okay, that's it.

1696
00:54:33,960 --> 00:54:34,960
 That is all of our facts.

1697
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:36,280
