00:00:00,00:00:02,(upbeat music)
00:00:02,00:00:14,- Hello and welcome to another episode
00:00:14,00:00:16,"of No Such Thing as a Fish,"
00:00:16,00:00:18,a weekly podcast coming to you
00:00:18,00:00:21,from the QI offices in Hoburn.
00:00:21,00:00:22,My name is Dan Schreiber.
00:00:22,00:00:24,"I am sitting here with Andrew Hunter Murray,"
00:00:24,00:00:27,James Harkin and Anna Tyshinski.
00:00:27,00:00:30,"Once again, we have gathered around the microphones"
00:00:30,00:00:33,with our four favorite facts of the last seven days.
00:00:33,00:00:37,"And in no particular order, here we go."
00:00:37,00:00:40,"Starting with fact number one, that is Anna."
00:00:40,00:00:43,- My fact this week is that some planes
00:00:43,00:00:47,are specifically built to carry other planes' wings.
00:00:47,00:00:48,How degrading.
00:00:48,00:00:49,- Is it?
00:00:49,00:00:52,- I think it's a bit degrading for those planes.
00:00:52,00:00:53,"Just, you know, you're the--"
00:00:53,00:00:55,"- Oh, I think they're the king planes."
00:00:55,00:00:56,"- Well, the wing was that, do you?"
00:00:56,00:00:57,"- Yeah, I think they're the planes"
00:00:57,00:00:59,without which other planes cannot be.
00:00:59,00:01:01,- I think they're more like a wingman.
00:01:01,00:01:03,- Very nice. - Nice.
00:01:03,00:01:06,"Well, whatever their social hierarchical status"
00:01:06,00:01:09,"in plane community, these are really cool looking planes."
00:01:09,00:01:11,"So I was just reading about plane construction,"
00:01:11,00:01:12,how planes are put together.
00:01:12,00:01:14,And it was saying how all the different bits
00:01:14,00:01:15,are made in different places.
00:01:15,00:01:17,And I was thinking how on Earth they get them
00:01:17,00:01:18,to where they're assembled.
00:01:18,00:01:22,"And for Airbus, which is the world's biggest aircraft maker,"
00:01:22,00:01:24,"they use this thing called Beluga XL,"
00:01:24,00:01:28,"which looks just like a Beluga whale,"
00:01:28,00:01:29,which is quite cool.
00:01:29,00:01:31,"It's got the big, we've talked about melons, haven't we,"
00:01:31,00:01:33,on the podcast for their big foreheads.
00:01:33,00:01:34,James is looking skeptical.
00:01:34,00:01:36,It doesn't look exactly like a Beluga whale.
00:01:36,00:01:37,You wouldn't confuse it with one.
00:01:37,00:01:38,- I've seen the image.
00:01:38,00:01:39,I think they look a bit like them.
00:01:39,00:01:41,I'm just trying to think if the average listener
00:01:41,00:01:43,is gonna know what a Beluga looks like.
00:01:43,00:01:45,"- Maybe a dolphin, I think a picture of dolphin."
00:01:45,00:01:46,- A dolphin with a big melon on its head.
00:01:46,00:01:48,"- Big bulbous head, yeah."
00:01:48,00:01:50,And they paint them to look like Beluga whales.
00:01:50,00:01:53,They paint the smile on to make them look friendly.
00:01:53,00:01:56,- They're very charming looking planes.
00:01:56,00:01:57,And they are amazing.
00:01:57,00:01:59,"So they are as long as two blue whales,"
00:01:59,00:02:00,just to continue the whale analogy.
00:02:00,00:02:02,"- Yeah, they're the biggest whale in the world"
00:02:02,00:02:03,"as a result, aren't they?"
00:02:03,00:02:04,(laughing)
00:02:04,00:02:06,"- Oh, nice."
00:02:06,00:02:07,"- And they're designed,"
00:02:07,00:02:10,"they can carry two wings for an Airbus A350,"
00:02:10,00:02:12,which is itself a really big plane.
00:02:12,00:02:13,"And they were designed, I think specifically,"
00:02:13,00:02:16,"to carry two of those, to fit them in,"
00:02:16,00:02:17,because those wings are massive.
00:02:17,00:02:21,And the whole face of the whale comes off.
00:02:21,00:02:22,So you don't load them in the back.
00:02:22,00:02:23,You just pull off the whale's head.
00:02:23,00:02:25,"- Well, it sort of lifts up, it lifts up, doesn't it?"
00:02:25,00:02:27,- So do the wings go on the inside?
00:02:27,00:02:28,"- Yeah, yes."
00:02:28,00:02:30,- Did you not just attach them to the actual wings?
00:02:30,00:02:32,- But then how do you fly back when you get there?
00:02:32,00:02:34,"- No, double wings, get them there faster."
00:02:34,00:02:35,"- Oh, like a biplane."
00:02:35,00:02:36,- A biplane.
00:02:36,00:02:37,- I don't know why they haven't thought of that.
00:02:37,00:02:38,- Yes.
00:02:38,00:02:41,But the Beluga is one of the smallest whales in the world.
00:02:41,00:02:44,"So actually, it should be a very small plane."
00:02:44,00:02:45,- Yeah.
00:02:45,00:02:46,- That is poorly named.
00:02:46,00:02:47,"- Yeah, yeah, silly."
00:02:47,00:02:48,- You know it's crazy as well.
00:02:48,00:02:51,So the Beluga XL is a more recent innovation
00:02:51,00:02:52,from the original Beluga.
00:02:52,00:02:57,The number of staff on the plane at any one time
00:02:57,00:02:59,"on the original Belugas, it's just two."
00:02:59,00:03:01,- Really?
00:03:01,00:03:02,- That's it.
00:03:02,00:03:03,You put the wings in.
00:03:03,00:03:04,"- Pilot, co-pilot."
00:03:04,00:03:04,"- Pilot, co-pilot."
00:03:04,00:03:08,- I assume not like two flight attendants.
00:03:08,00:03:10,(all laughing)
00:03:10,00:03:14,"- But now the XL has a third member, the load master."
00:03:14,00:03:16,"- Oh, cool."
00:03:16,00:03:18,- Suggested one person's loading the wings on.
00:03:18,00:03:20,- She is quite wild.
00:03:20,00:03:22,- Is it to make sure I suppose that they stay strapped down
00:03:22,00:03:22,during the flight?
00:03:22,00:03:23,- Yeah.
00:03:23,00:03:24,- It's all right.
00:03:24,00:03:25,I got it.
00:03:25,00:03:27,- That's a pretty sexy job title.
00:03:27,00:03:27,"- Yeah, load master."
00:03:27,00:03:28,- What are you?
00:03:28,00:03:29,"Oh, I'm a load master."
00:03:29,00:03:30,"- Oh yeah, and what do you do?"
00:03:30,00:03:35,"- I watch small piece of Velcro in terror,"
00:03:35,00:03:36,fearing it's gonna come undone.
00:03:36,00:03:37,"- Cool, cool."
00:03:37,00:03:40,I'm gonna speak to this person over here now.
00:03:40,00:03:42,(all laughing)
00:03:42,00:03:43,They didn't always use aeroplanes
00:03:43,00:03:45,to get these things around.
00:03:45,00:03:48,"The Airbus A380, they used to move everything around"
00:03:48,00:03:53,"using something called the Itinerair, a grand gabarit."
00:03:53,00:03:55,And that is a water and road route
00:03:55,00:03:58,that was created just to move pieces
00:03:58,00:04:00,of this aeroplane around Europe.
00:04:00,00:04:00,- No way.
00:04:00,00:04:01,- So cool.
00:04:01,00:04:04,- They dig sort of giant canals across Europe
00:04:04,00:04:05,that we didn't notice.
00:04:05,00:04:08,"- Well, I think they more used existing canals"
00:04:08,00:04:09,and made them a bit wider.
00:04:09,00:04:10,- Cool.
00:04:10,00:04:11,- And also use existing roads
00:04:11,00:04:12,and made them a bit stronger.
00:04:12,00:04:14,"But basically they were put together in Toulouse,"
00:04:14,00:04:17,"but the bits were made in France, Germany, Spain,"
00:04:17,00:04:18,United Kingdom even.
00:04:18,00:04:21,And so they had to bring all the bits together to Toulouse
00:04:21,00:04:22,so they could make them.
00:04:22,00:04:24,But they had to reinforce everything
00:04:24,00:04:25,because they're so big.
00:04:25,00:04:25,- Right.
00:04:25,00:04:27,- And they would always travel at night time.
00:04:27,00:04:28,- That's so cool.
00:04:28,00:04:30,- So they'd park up in some lay by during the day.
00:04:30,00:04:33,"And then at night time, they'd drive around with these."
00:04:33,00:04:35,"- They do all these big load people,"
00:04:35,00:04:36,"largely 'cause it's a real inconvenience in the day,"
00:04:36,00:04:38,but that makes it sound sexy as well.
00:04:38,00:04:39,"- Oh, it sounds covert, yeah."
00:04:39,00:04:40,- When it's the only travel at night.
00:04:40,00:04:42,- I'm a night load mask.
00:04:42,00:04:43,"- Yeah, I don't normally come to these parties"
00:04:43,00:04:46,because I'm a bit of a night load mask.
00:04:46,00:04:48,(all laughing)
00:04:48,00:04:49,"- On that, James."
00:04:49,00:04:51,So you know how NASA gets its rockets around?
00:04:51,00:04:54,- I do actually.
00:04:54,00:04:55,- Okay.
00:04:55,00:04:56,"Well, can you pretend you don't for them?"
00:04:56,00:05:01,"- No, do they attach balloons to it and float it around?"
00:05:01,00:05:05,"- No, they use barges."
00:05:05,00:05:07,They have a barge called Pegasus.
00:05:07,00:05:09,"And they load the rocket on,"
00:05:09,00:05:11,'cause it's from the assembly factories in Louisiana.
00:05:11,00:05:12,And they need to get it
00:05:12,00:05:14,to the Kennedy Space Center in Florida.
00:05:14,00:05:15,And it's 100 meters long
00:05:15,00:05:16,and they just load the rocket on.
00:05:16,00:05:17,And then it doesn't have an engine.
00:05:17,00:05:19,The tugs have to just tug it all the way.
00:05:19,00:05:21,- How far are those two places apart?
00:05:21,00:05:22,- They're quite far.
00:05:22,00:05:24,"- From where to where, sorry?"
00:05:24,00:05:26,"- From Louisiana to the Cape Battle,"
00:05:26,00:05:28,"it's probably about 400 miles, I'd say."
00:05:28,00:05:30,"- Yeah, you wouldn't walk it at a gas."
00:05:30,00:05:32,"- So I think that's weird, isn't it?"
00:05:32,00:05:34,"- It's weird because the word barge is so,"
00:05:34,00:05:36,"yeah, you picture it's like toad in the hole or something."
00:05:36,00:05:37,- We're in Venice.
00:05:37,00:05:39,"- Yeah, all Venice."
00:05:39,00:05:41,"- If you go to Venice with your wife,"
00:05:41,00:05:43,"are you saying, ""Hey, let's get a barge."""
00:05:43,00:05:44,(all laughing)
00:05:44,00:05:45,- Darling.
00:05:45,00:05:47,- You've got us the most amazing deal.
00:05:47,00:05:48,(all laughing)
00:05:48,00:05:51,- Now there will only be three staff on the barge.
00:05:51,00:05:52,(all laughing)
00:05:52,00:05:54,- But we will velcro you down.
00:05:54,00:05:57,"Now, yeah, what I found interesting about that NASA barge"
00:05:57,00:05:59,is actually it's only about 50% longer
00:05:59,00:06:02,and wider than a standard canal boat.
00:06:02,00:06:05,"'Cause canal boats are quite long, aren't they?"
00:06:05,00:06:05,- Wow.
00:06:05,00:06:07,"- I mean, having stayed on a canal boat for a week,"
00:06:07,00:06:08,it doesn't feel spacious.
00:06:08,00:06:11,"- Maybe not a narrow boat, like the tiny narrow boats."
00:06:11,00:06:12,'Cause those are--
00:06:12,00:06:15,"- Oh, I'm not talking about a rising-gym style narrow boat."
00:06:15,00:06:17,- It's 310 by 50 feet.
00:06:17,00:06:19,"So I'm pretty sure that that's not,"
00:06:19,00:06:22,"it's only, it's not twice as big as a normal canal boat."
00:06:22,00:06:23,"It's pretty amazing, isn't it?"
00:06:23,00:06:24,- It is amazing.
00:06:24,00:06:26,"- But they have got another way of doing it, haven't they?"
00:06:26,00:06:29,They use a thing called the pregnant guppy.
00:06:29,00:06:29,- Oh!
00:06:29,00:06:32,- Which is a modified Boeing 377.
00:06:32,00:06:34,"- Yes, and this was at the start,"
00:06:34,00:06:35,"well, they made their first pregnant guppy"
00:06:35,00:06:37,start of the space race.
00:06:37,00:06:39,So I think then they went back to barges for a while
00:06:39,00:06:42,'cause this was in the '60s
00:06:42,00:06:44,and it was a massive problem.
00:06:44,00:06:46,"'Cause at that time, they were made on the West Coast"
00:06:46,00:06:48,and then had to be taken to Cape Canaveral.
00:06:48,00:06:50,"And yeah, it was just taking forever"
00:06:50,00:06:52,and they had to go through the Panama Canal and--
00:06:52,00:06:53,- So far.
00:06:53,00:06:55,- It took about a couple of days.
00:06:55,00:06:56,- You mean the America Canal?
00:06:56,00:06:59,"- Sorry, sorry, yes."
00:06:59,00:07:03,And they took the transport time from 25 to 35 days
00:07:03,00:07:07,"down to 18 hours, but it was,"
00:07:07,00:07:08,that's what inspired the Beluga designs.
00:07:08,00:07:10,"'Cause if you look at them, they look kind of similar,"
00:07:10,00:07:11,don't they?
00:07:11,00:07:12,"- They really do, yeah."
00:07:12,00:07:13,"- The pregnant guppy, the pregnant guppy inspired them."
00:07:13,00:07:15,"- Yeah, absolutely, they're all nautical,"
00:07:15,00:07:18,"or they're all sea creatures, guppies and belugas."
00:07:18,00:07:21,"- Yeah, I think that's a good thing."
00:07:21,00:07:22,The beluga was a nod to the guppy.
00:07:22,00:07:23,- 'Cause the guy who created the guppy
00:07:23,00:07:24,was a guy called John M. Conroy
00:07:24,00:07:25,and he also came up with a plane
00:07:25,00:07:28,"called the Conroy Sky Monster, cool."
00:07:28,00:07:31,"Just such great names these planes have, so cool."
00:07:31,00:07:33,"Hey, this is pretty cool, the Beluga XL,"
00:07:33,00:07:35,it doesn't just take wings.
00:07:35,00:07:38,"It often gets, well, sometimes gets asked"
00:07:38,00:07:39,to bring a few other things.
00:07:39,00:07:41,"And at one time in 1999,"
00:07:41,00:07:44,it carried the liberty leading the people painting.
00:07:44,00:07:47,So this is that French painting by Eugene Deliffoy.
00:07:47,00:07:51,"- And the things you make when you say that,"
00:07:51,00:07:53,it's such a shame the listener can't see it.
00:07:53,00:07:55,- It's why I'm not allowed to go to France.
00:07:55,00:07:57,"And yeah, so that's very famous, isn't it?"
00:07:57,00:07:59,- It's a massive campus.
00:07:59,00:08:01,- Like one of them's holding a big flag.
00:08:01,00:08:04,"- Yeah, there's a lady in a bit of a state of undress."
00:08:04,00:08:06,She's definitely in an emotional state.
00:08:06,00:08:06,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:08:06,00:08:07,- She's got the flag.
00:08:07,00:08:08,- One of the buttons has fallen off.
00:08:08,00:08:09,- Yes.
00:08:09,00:08:11,- And she'll be livid when she finds out
00:08:11,00:08:12,someone was painting that scene.
00:08:12,00:08:14,(all laughing)
00:08:14,00:08:16,It was learned from Paris to Tokyo.
00:08:16,00:08:18,And so they needed to get it over there.
00:08:18,00:08:21,"It's too large to fit in what was, I guess,"
00:08:21,00:08:23,"the biggest transport plane at the time, Boeing 747."
00:08:23,00:08:27,So they needed to use a Beluga in order to do it.
00:08:27,00:08:32,It is a 9.8 feet tall and 11.8 feet long.
00:08:32,00:08:34,- That is small.
00:08:34,00:08:35,- I feel like I've been in a Boeing 747.
00:08:35,00:08:37,"- That's about the same size as this wall, isn't it?"
00:08:37,00:08:38,- Yeah.
00:08:38,00:08:39,- It's a bit smaller.
00:08:39,00:08:40,- It's a bit taller and a bit smaller.
00:08:40,00:08:41,- But you've got to package it up
00:08:41,00:08:43,"and you need to make sure it's really good packaging, right?"
00:08:43,00:08:45,So that's going to add exercise.
00:08:45,00:08:47,"I mean, have you ever, tons of bubble wrap?"
00:08:47,00:08:49,"You know, in your order for, like a, you know,"
00:08:49,00:08:51,sometimes you order just like a lipstick from Amazon.
00:08:51,00:08:52,"- Always, yeah."
00:08:52,00:08:54,"- Yeah, it comes in a giant box."
00:08:54,00:08:57,- I was on a flight last week and I bought a bag of crisps.
00:08:57,00:08:58,And then I forgot about it.
00:08:58,00:09:00,"And then halfway through the flight, I went,"
00:09:00,00:09:01,"""Oh, I'll have that bag of crisps."""
00:09:01,00:09:04,I went to my bag and the bag of crisps was enormous.
00:09:04,00:09:05,"Like, 'cause the pressure changed, right?"
00:09:05,00:09:07,"- Oh, right."
00:09:07,00:09:08,"- Okay, so it would like, okay."
00:09:08,00:09:11,So I wondered if you had an enormous bubble wrap
00:09:11,00:09:13,"around your painting,"
00:09:13,00:09:14,where the whole thing would just balloon
00:09:14,00:09:16,to like 10 times the size.
00:09:16,00:09:17,- So it looks small when you put it in
00:09:17,00:09:19,"and everyone's going, ""That could fit on a seven,"
00:09:19,00:09:22,"""fourth sense level, you wait 'til we get in the air."""
00:09:22,00:09:24,"- But yeah, they had to put it in a vertical position."
00:09:24,00:09:26,There was a special pressurized container
00:09:26,00:09:27,so it didn't get damaged on the way.
00:09:27,00:09:30,And they had these anti-vibration devices
00:09:30,00:09:31,that were in it as well.
00:09:31,00:09:32,Yeah.
00:09:32,00:09:33,- I feel like this is missing flow.
00:09:33,00:09:34,- Just in case the load master got excited.
00:09:34,00:09:36,(all laughing)
00:09:36,00:09:37,- Loopy plates.
00:09:37,00:09:38,- Okay.
00:09:38,00:09:42,- So various countries have really led the field in this.
00:09:42,00:09:46,I think the Germans had a pretty good record for a while.
00:09:46,00:09:49,Did you hear about the Blohmann Ross BV-141?
00:09:49,00:09:51,(all laughing)
00:09:51,00:09:53,- I'm just gonna go speak to this guy now.
00:09:53,00:09:55,(all laughing)
00:09:55,00:09:56,- This is so amazing.
00:09:56,00:09:59,"So picture a classic, let's say a bomber plane from the war."
00:09:59,00:10:01,"You know, you've got the main fuselage in the middle,"
00:10:01,00:10:02,you've got the wings on either side
00:10:02,00:10:04,and you've got an engine on each wing
00:10:04,00:10:06,and maybe the propeller on each.
00:10:06,00:10:06,- Got it.
00:10:06,00:10:07,- Classic engine.
00:10:07,00:10:08,"- Yeah, classic plane."
00:10:08,00:10:11,- Maybe next time just say picture a plane.
00:10:11,00:10:13,(all laughing)
00:10:13,00:10:15,"- Picture a plane, you're ahead of the top."
00:10:15,00:10:16,"- Second one, more plane."
00:10:16,00:10:18,"- Second one, more style bomber, right?"
00:10:18,00:10:21,"This was a plane which had the fuselage, sure,"
00:10:21,00:10:23,but that's not in the middle.
00:10:23,00:10:23,- Uh-huh.
00:10:23,00:10:25,"- So there's a wing, then there's a fuselage,"
00:10:25,00:10:26,then there's a separate wing
00:10:26,00:10:28,and the crew are sitting in a little pod
00:10:28,00:10:30,halfway along that wing.
00:10:30,00:10:31,"- Oh, cool."
00:10:31,00:10:33,- It is the weirdest looking thing.
00:10:33,00:10:34,- But what's the reason?
00:10:34,00:10:35,- Reconnaissance.
00:10:35,00:10:38,- So it gave a better view for reconnaissance photos
00:10:38,00:10:41,to have you not being in the main bit of the plane.
00:10:41,00:10:43,"- Okay, well, 'cause the wing doesn't get in the way maybe."
00:10:43,00:10:45,I always think the wing gets in the way of the view a bit
00:10:45,00:10:45,when you look out the wings.
00:10:45,00:10:46,- Yeah.
00:10:46,00:10:48,- And that's actually invented a wingless plane
00:10:48,00:10:50,which they flew called the flying bathtub.
00:10:50,00:10:51,(all laughing)
00:10:51,00:10:53,"And it was in the 1960s, they're experimenting."
00:10:53,00:10:54,"If you look at a photo of it,"
00:10:54,00:10:57,"it literally, it looks like just the plane, no wings,"
00:10:57,00:10:59,and it managed to take off and they used to-
00:10:59,00:11:01,- And what's giving it the lift?
00:11:01,00:11:02,- You have to roll it down a hill
00:11:02,00:11:04,with three yorks and another.
00:11:04,00:11:06,(all laughing)
00:11:06,00:11:10,- It's a lot for the older generations.
00:11:10,00:11:11,"- I think it's playing it, don't explain it."
00:11:11,00:11:14,(all laughing)
00:11:14,00:11:15,"- Yeah, what was the actual answer, please?"
00:11:15,00:11:16,- I was sort of hoping James's joke
00:11:16,00:11:19,would make us run past that.
00:11:19,00:11:22,- I'll always wait out the joke.
00:11:22,00:11:24,"Turn to the answer, thank you very much."
00:11:24,00:11:25,"So we don't have a flu, we have a flu."
00:11:25,00:11:26,- You have a high flu.
00:11:26,00:11:27,- A flu.
00:11:27,00:11:28,- Do you wanna hear a plane we never got?
00:11:28,00:11:29,The Lockheed flatbed.
00:11:29,00:11:30,- Okay.
00:11:30,00:11:31,- This is bananas.
00:11:31,00:11:34,"- Okay, so what's the thing about planes?"
00:11:34,00:11:35,So you got your two wings.
00:11:35,00:11:38,- You're gonna have an engine underneath each one.
00:11:38,00:11:42,"- Okay, but you put everything you got in your plane, right?"
00:11:42,00:11:44,Or your people in their bags.
00:11:44,00:11:46,"There's still a load of space above them, isn't there?"
00:11:46,00:11:46,- Yeah.
00:11:46,00:11:47,- There's still a load of head room
00:11:47,00:11:50,that is unnecessary wasting of that tube of the plane.
00:11:50,00:11:51,- Oh yeah.
00:11:51,00:11:54,- So one of you had a plane which had the wings
00:11:54,00:11:56,"and it's got the head and the tail,"
00:11:56,00:11:59,but then it's just like a flatbed truck in the middle.
00:11:59,00:12:00,It's not a tube.
00:12:00,00:12:00,- Okay.
00:12:00,00:12:02,- Do the people have to lie down in it?
00:12:02,00:12:03,- It's not for people.
00:12:03,00:12:05,"- Oh, it's for people."
00:12:05,00:12:07,- It's just for paintings by Delacroix.
00:12:07,00:12:10,"- It's for like, I don't know,"
00:12:10,00:12:13,"like a big lorry or a tank or whatever,"
00:12:13,00:12:16,like something you need to move by air that just goes
00:12:16,00:12:17,in an open top sandwich.
00:12:17,00:12:18,"- No, it's a convertible plane."
00:12:18,00:12:20,"- Stunt that down, convertible plane."
00:12:20,00:12:21,- Cool.
00:12:21,00:12:23,"- And that was designed and tragically it was,"
00:12:23,00:12:25,"I don't think it was built, it was designed in the 80s."
00:12:25,00:12:26,"The pilots get to sit in a compartment,"
00:12:26,00:12:27,but mostly it's open.
00:12:27,00:12:29,"- Yeah, otherwise your hair would get completely messed up,"
00:12:29,00:12:30,isn't it? - That's true.
00:12:30,00:12:32,- Do you guys know about the X planes?
00:12:32,00:12:34,"- Yes, where have they gone?"
00:12:34,00:12:35,They were meant to be the future.
00:12:35,00:12:36,"- Well. - What it is,"
00:12:36,00:12:37,it's how the X men get around.
00:12:37,00:12:38,"- Yes, exactly."
00:12:38,00:12:39,They are the future.
00:12:39,00:12:41,And basically we only learn about them
00:12:41,00:12:43,after they've been declassified.
00:12:43,00:12:46,"So, you know, there might be still some X planes being made,"
00:12:46,00:12:48,"but we don't know about them yet, right?"
00:12:48,00:12:50,But we know about the ones which have been made
00:12:50,00:12:51,and weren't useful.
00:12:51,00:12:53,A lot of them were missiles.
00:12:53,00:12:55,"There was one called the stiletto,"
00:12:55,00:12:58,"which looks like basically the bottom of a shoe,"
00:12:58,00:13:00,"of a women's shoe, extremely thin aeroplane."
00:13:00,00:13:03,"They thought it might be able to go really, really fast."
00:13:03,00:13:04,- Who's making all these X planes?
00:13:04,00:13:05,- This is the US.
00:13:05,00:13:06,- Okay. - Yeah.
00:13:06,00:13:07,- And what's their category?
00:13:07,00:13:09,Their secret until they're released?
00:13:09,00:13:10,"- Secret until they're released, yeah."
00:13:10,00:13:12,So if you're making a secret sort of wacky plane
00:13:12,00:13:14,"and you're in the American military,"
00:13:14,00:13:18,"dick dastardly is in charge,"
00:13:18,00:13:21,then you give them an X designation.
00:13:21,00:13:22,- I see. - And then eventually
00:13:22,00:13:23,some of them cloud.
00:13:23,00:13:28,The X 43 was in 2004 and it flew at Mach 9.6.
00:13:29,00:13:32,"So at 9.6 times the speed of sound,"
00:13:32,00:13:34,"it was about 7,000 miles per hour."
00:13:34,00:13:36,- No.
00:13:36,00:13:40,- But the engine only was able to run for 10 seconds.
00:13:40,00:13:42,(all laughing)
00:13:42,00:13:45,"So they got that fast, but they couldn't do it for very long."
00:13:45,00:13:47,"- You still popped Paris, couldn't you?"
00:13:47,00:13:48,- That was great.
00:13:48,00:13:50,- Can I tell you guys one really amazing thing
00:13:50,00:13:52,about moving big stuff around?
00:13:52,00:13:53,- Yeah.
00:13:53,00:13:57,"- Wind turbines, those big sort of arms of wind turbines,"
00:13:57,00:13:59,you have to basically make them in one piece
00:13:59,00:14:01,and then get them to where they need to go.
00:14:01,00:14:03,You can't make them and then stick them together
00:14:03,00:14:05,'cause they need to be really strong.
00:14:05,00:14:09,"And so they put them on enormous flatbed trucks, right?"
00:14:09,00:14:11,But sometimes the place where you need to put your
00:14:11,00:14:13,wind turbine is in the countryside.
00:14:13,00:14:16,How do you get through a little town
00:14:16,00:14:18,with these massive wind turbine trucks?
00:14:18,00:14:21,- Do you have to just take everything down basically?
00:14:21,00:14:22,"Like anything that goes over the street,"
00:14:22,00:14:23,any wires or anything?
00:14:23,00:14:24,- Sometimes that would happen.
00:14:24,00:14:26,"Yeah, in the past that's had to happen"
00:14:26,00:14:29,or they've had to like make roads way wider.
00:14:29,00:14:32,They've had to pave over the top of roundabouts
00:14:32,00:14:34,because they can't go roundabouts.
00:14:34,00:14:37,But they've invented a new class of vehicle
00:14:37,00:14:39,called the self-propelled rotor blade adapter.
00:14:39,00:14:40,And this is amazing.
00:14:40,00:14:43,So you drive your truck and it's on a flatbed
00:14:43,00:14:46,and then the rotor blade of the wind turbine
00:14:46,00:14:51,"can move upwards so that it's perpendicular to the ground,"
00:14:51,00:14:53,which means you can drive it much better
00:14:53,00:14:54,around like tight corners.
00:14:54,00:14:57,- It does mean you've got the biggest sale known to man.
00:14:57,00:14:59,(all laughing)
00:14:59,00:15:01,- They would only do it at nighttime
00:15:01,00:15:02,and everything's really quiet.
00:15:02,00:15:06,"But otherwise, you're knocking down like trees and."
00:15:06,00:15:07,"- I've actually seen,"
00:15:07,00:15:08,I think they sometimes don't do it at night
00:15:08,00:15:10,'cause there's a really good video.
00:15:10,00:15:12,"Someone drive, I think it's in Hull,"
00:15:12,00:15:13,"a really good video of a truck,"
00:15:13,00:15:16,"which looks microscopic when you put a 100 meter,"
00:15:16,00:15:18,like wind turbines might get up to 100 meters long.
00:15:18,00:15:22,I think this one's 70 meter long turbine blade on it
00:15:22,00:15:24,sticking up like James says in the air.
00:15:24,00:15:25,"And then behind it,"
00:15:25,00:15:29,there's one guy walking in fluorescent gear
00:15:29,00:15:30,with a hard hat on.
00:15:30,00:15:31,- He's the load master.
00:15:31,00:15:33,(all laughing)
00:15:33,00:15:34,- Come on and go hearty together.
00:15:34,00:15:36,(all laughing)
00:15:36,00:15:39,(upbeat music)
00:15:39,00:15:44,"- Okay, it is time for fact number two and that is Andy."
00:15:44,00:15:47,My fact is that Japan has just experienced
00:15:47,00:15:50,its maximum ever number of traffic lights.
00:15:50,00:15:51,(all laughing)
00:15:51,00:15:53,- Is this by Royal Decree?
00:15:53,00:15:56,"- It's, yeah, it's an imperial thing."
00:15:56,00:15:58,They've decided they're just too darn many.
00:15:58,00:15:59,"- No, why is this?"
00:15:59,00:16:02,"Like, how can you be sure that they're not gonna add more?"
00:16:02,00:16:03,"- I'm not positive,"
00:16:03,00:16:07,but barring surprising demographic shifts.
00:16:07,00:16:08,- I see.
00:16:08,00:16:09,"- Which aren't unheard of,"
00:16:09,00:16:11,Japan will never have as many traffic lights
00:16:11,00:16:12,as it does now.
00:16:12,00:16:14,- Is your fact that Japan's population is going down?
00:16:14,00:16:18,"- No, that's, no, it's closely related to that fact."
00:16:18,00:16:19,- Okay.
00:16:19,00:16:20,- I'll grant you that.
00:16:20,00:16:20,- Just joking.
00:16:20,00:16:21,- This was a piece in the FT
00:16:21,00:16:25,about the fact that Japan's population is going down.
00:16:25,00:16:28,(all laughing)
00:16:28,00:16:31,"- But if you've got fewer people,"
00:16:31,00:16:33,you need fewer traffic lights.
00:16:33,00:16:35,"- It's basically, do you remember"
00:16:35,00:16:37,"we did the thing about conveyor belts,"
00:16:37,00:16:38,that man Japanese scheme to have conveyor belts
00:16:38,00:16:40,"instead of freight lorries, you know,"
00:16:40,00:16:42,in rural bits of the country.
00:16:42,00:16:44,"Basically, many traffic lights are quite old now"
00:16:44,00:16:47,and roads in rural areas are emptying of traffic.
00:16:47,00:16:49,So the police have just announced
00:16:49,00:16:50,from this year more traffic lights
00:16:50,00:16:52,will be decommissioned than newly installed.
00:16:52,00:16:55,So the total number's going down demographics.
00:16:55,00:16:57,"It's called the 2025 problem actually in Japan,"
00:16:57,00:17:01,"which is where this massive baby boomer generation,"
00:17:01,00:17:05,they are moving from early old to old old.
00:17:05,00:17:06,They're over 75 now.
00:17:06,00:17:08,"So they're moving into more of the,"
00:17:08,00:17:09,"and that's not advanced old age,"
00:17:09,00:17:11,"but you know what I mean, they're getting older."
00:17:11,00:17:13,"And that just means big changes, man."
00:17:13,00:17:14,"This is one of them, yeah?"
00:17:14,00:17:16,- Is it that they don't know how to use traffic lights
00:17:16,00:17:17,anymore 'cause they're getting older?
00:17:17,00:17:19,"- No, it's more like that will lead to lots of shifts"
00:17:19,00:17:22,in terms of the amount of social care you need for people.
00:17:22,00:17:24,If you have a big cohort of society
00:17:24,00:17:25,"who are no longer in early old age,"
00:17:25,00:17:28,"but in older old age, that will lead to big things."
00:17:28,00:17:29,And that's why they're experimenting with lots of things
00:17:29,00:17:32,like robots in care homes and things like this.
00:17:32,00:17:33,They're trying to solve it
00:17:33,00:17:34,with a combination of robotics and other things.
00:17:34,00:17:36,Mostly robots 'cause it's Japan.
00:17:36,00:17:37,- It's not just depopulation.
00:17:37,00:17:40,"It's the fact that the traffic lights themselves,"
00:17:40,00:17:42,they have a life expectancy of 19 years.
00:17:42,00:17:44,"And so if you wanna redo them up,"
00:17:44,00:17:47,"it costs about 6,000 pounds"
00:17:47,00:17:48,in order to do each traffic light.
00:17:48,00:17:51,"And they just saying, actually, let's just take them down."
00:17:51,00:17:54,It's depopulation and old age of the lights themselves.
00:17:54,00:17:56,"- So as to your question, James,"
00:17:56,00:18:00,if Japan suddenly goes on the bonkathon of the century
00:18:00,00:18:02,"and suddenly the population is gonna double,"
00:18:02,00:18:06,then they might consider Japanese bonkathon.
00:18:06,00:18:07,- I love it.
00:18:07,00:18:09,You mentioned robots.
00:18:09,00:18:12,Robot is what a traffic light is in South Africa.
00:18:12,00:18:12,- Beautiful.
00:18:12,00:18:13,- What does that mean?
00:18:13,00:18:14,- That's what they call them.
00:18:14,00:18:15,Robots. - Really?
00:18:15,00:18:16,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:18:16,00:18:17,- What are they called robots?
00:18:17,00:18:20,(all laughing)
00:18:20,00:18:24,- I think you can have the same name for two things.
00:18:24,00:18:24,- I don't think so.
00:18:24,00:18:25,- It might get confusing though.
00:18:25,00:18:26,- It might be.
00:18:26,00:18:27,They were originally called that.
00:18:27,00:18:31,"So in Johannesburg, the first one came in 1927"
00:18:31,00:18:34,"and they were called robots and they still are,"
00:18:34,00:18:36,but they're quite unreliable in Joburg
00:18:36,00:18:39,and people knock them over quite a lot.
00:18:39,00:18:43,The Johannesburg drivers damage 81 robots a month
00:18:43,00:18:44,and they have to replace them
00:18:44,00:18:47,and they often replace them with quite high-tech things
00:18:47,00:18:50,and those high-tech things often get stolen
00:18:50,00:18:52,'cause they have lots of metal in the cables
00:18:52,00:18:53,and stuff like that.
00:18:53,00:18:57,"They fitted loads of them with a monitoring system,"
00:18:57,00:18:59,but the monitoring system had SIM cards in
00:18:59,00:19:01,and people realized they could just steal the SIM cards
00:19:01,00:19:03,and use them in their phones and make free calls.
00:19:03,00:19:04,"- Wait, what?"
00:19:04,00:19:07,"- And the problem is so bad that in some cases,"
00:19:07,00:19:10,jail sentences or attacking robots can be as high
00:19:10,00:19:13,as they are for murder in Johannesburg.
00:19:13,00:19:14,- Wow.
00:19:14,00:19:15,- Because they decided we're gonna stop this
00:19:15,00:19:18,so we're gonna make the punishments really high.
00:19:18,00:19:19,- That's wow.
00:19:19,00:19:20,"- Yeah, big problem."
00:19:20,00:19:21,- That is a big problem.
00:19:21,00:19:24,Singapore's got an interesting thing with its traffic lights.
00:19:24,00:19:26,"Depending on who's crossing the road,"
00:19:26,00:19:30,you might be stuck at a red light in your car longer
00:19:30,00:19:33,than if someone else was crossing the road.
00:19:33,00:19:34,Is this a riddle?
00:19:34,00:19:36,"Yeah, go for it."
00:19:36,00:19:38,- Is it that they've got sensors to tell if it's someone
00:19:38,00:19:40,in a wheelchair or an elderly person
00:19:40,00:19:41,who takes longer to cross?
00:19:41,00:19:43,"- So yeah, but it's not sensors."
00:19:43,00:19:45,This is a new thing which they're gonna slowly spread out
00:19:45,00:19:46,"through all of Singapore,"
00:19:46,00:19:49,"which is if an elderly person is trying to cross the road,"
00:19:49,00:19:52,"they have a car, which is kind of like a pensioner's card,"
00:19:52,00:19:55,"which they tap onto the side,"
00:19:55,00:19:57,which tells the signal that there's an old person crossing
00:19:57,00:20:01,and they get an additional 13 seconds to cross the road.
00:20:01,00:20:02,- I think that's such a good idea.
00:20:02,00:20:04,"I spend a lot of time with pedestrian crossings thinking,"
00:20:04,00:20:07,this is way too little time if you're really old.
00:20:07,00:20:09,Sometimes I can even only just get across.
00:20:09,00:20:12,And especially if you're not there at the very start.
00:20:12,00:20:12,- Yeah.
00:20:12,00:20:13,"- If you're an older person, you're like,"
00:20:13,00:20:15,I'm not gonna start unless I was there at the beginning.
00:20:15,00:20:16,- Yeah.
00:20:16,00:20:17,- Some of the roads in Singapore quite long as well.
00:20:17,00:20:18,"- Yeah, quite wide."
00:20:18,00:20:19,- They're quite wide.
00:20:19,00:20:20,"Yeah, they have lots of lanes."
00:20:20,00:20:22,"Like almost as wide as Amosways,"
00:20:22,00:20:23,but they're just normal A roads.
00:20:23,00:20:25,- God imagine getting to sort of the middle
00:20:25,00:20:27,"of a 12-lane road,"
00:20:27,00:20:30,"realizing and looking behind and in front and thinking,"
00:20:30,00:20:31,- Surely tap my car.
00:20:31,00:20:31,- Did you tap my car?
00:20:31,00:20:33,"- Did you tap, darling?"
00:20:33,00:20:34,I thought you tapped.
00:20:34,00:20:35,- You did have to.
00:20:35,00:20:38,- People in wheelchairs are much likely
00:20:38,00:20:39,"to be in traffic-related accidents,"
00:20:39,00:20:41,"partly 'cause they might take a bit longer to cross,"
00:20:41,00:20:43,but also partly because they're way less visible
00:20:43,00:20:44,'cause you're at a lower height.
00:20:44,00:20:46,"So in Vienna, the cameras can detect that"
00:20:46,00:20:48,and they sort of work out with 99% accuracy
00:20:48,00:20:50,whether you want to cross the road or not.
00:20:50,00:20:51,- How cool is that?
00:20:51,00:20:53,"- I honestly thought we had similar things in London,"
00:20:53,00:20:54,I must say.
00:20:54,00:20:55,Like there's one near our house
00:20:55,00:20:57,which gets you across to the park.
00:20:57,00:20:59,"And I swear when people are slowly going across it,"
00:20:59,00:21:01,it stays on for longer.
00:21:01,00:21:01,"- Oh, really?"
00:21:01,00:21:02,"- You've got to get out there with your stopwatch, right?"
00:21:02,00:21:05,"- I know, I'm gonna get out."
00:21:05,00:21:07,"- Did you know, outrage of outrage that,"
00:21:07,00:21:09,"well, first of all, I've always been fascinated"
00:21:09,00:21:10,by traffic-like technology.
00:21:10,00:21:12,"And I've like Googled this loads before,"
00:21:12,00:21:13,"like how they're all coordinated,"
00:21:13,00:21:15,how many lights are rigged up to the same system.
00:21:15,00:21:17,"'Cause you know, they all seem to change"
00:21:17,00:21:19,in coordination with each other.
00:21:19,00:21:21,You have something called a green wave.
00:21:21,00:21:22,Do you know what green wave is?
00:21:22,00:21:24,"- Well, I came back from the airport the other day"
00:21:24,00:21:27,and I was driving from Stanstead into central London
00:21:27,00:21:29,and it felt like every single light was on green.
00:21:29,00:21:31,I just got so lucky.
00:21:31,00:21:32,- That's 'cause you'd had your crisps
00:21:32,00:21:33,that you were in a good mood.
00:21:33,00:21:35,(all laughing)
00:21:35,00:21:38,"- But what I thought is, if you hit one green,"
00:21:38,00:21:39,does that mean you're gonna hit all the greens?
00:21:39,00:21:41,'Cause you're just going at the right pace.
00:21:41,00:21:42,"- Well, it usually depends on whether"
00:21:42,00:21:43,you're in a row of traffic.
00:21:43,00:21:44,"- Well, no one was there."
00:21:44,00:21:45,It's the middle of the night.
00:21:45,00:21:46,"- Okay, well, that's very weird."
00:21:46,00:21:46,"And you just got lucky, I think."
00:21:46,00:21:47,(all laughing)
00:21:47,00:21:48,"- Well, if it was the middle of the light,"
00:21:48,00:21:50,they'd just have them on green
00:21:50,00:21:52,unless another car comes.
00:21:52,00:21:53,But the green wave is basically-
00:21:53,00:21:56,"- Well, you're driving a wind turbine blade at the time."
00:21:56,00:21:58,(all laughing)
00:21:58,00:22:01,"- This is when loads of lights along the same route,"
00:22:01,00:22:03,along the same straight stretch of road
00:22:03,00:22:05,are coordinated to go green one after the other
00:22:05,00:22:06,to stop cars stopping.
00:22:06,00:22:09,"Now, usually it only works if you're in a row of traffic"
00:22:09,00:22:11,because environmentally it's much more friendly
00:22:11,00:22:13,to not have lots of cars stopping and starting
00:22:13,00:22:15,"'cause when engines stop and start,"
00:22:15,00:22:16,that's worse for the environment.
00:22:16,00:22:19,"So, people say that if you are in a green wave,"
00:22:19,00:22:21,"if you catch a green wave,"
00:22:21,00:22:22,"then a bit like getting in a slipstream,"
00:22:22,00:22:24,you've got to stay close to the car in front.
00:22:24,00:22:26,"Not too close, but close enough"
00:22:26,00:22:28,that you don't break the green wave
00:22:28,00:22:29,so that you can get through all the greens.
00:22:29,00:22:31,'Cause if suddenly you let enough distance
00:22:31,00:22:33,"between you and the car in front happen,"
00:22:33,00:22:35,then the light will go red.
00:22:35,00:22:35,- Okay.
00:22:35,00:22:36,- So-
00:22:36,00:22:38,- So is everyone on board?
00:22:38,00:22:40,"Are you in the car going,"
00:22:40,00:22:41,"""Oh my God, we're in a green wave."""
00:22:41,00:22:42,"- You should be, yeah."
00:22:42,00:22:43,"- Right, and then you will-"
00:22:43,00:22:44,- Then you will think to each other.
00:22:44,00:22:46,"- Conger it along, yeah, that's pretty cool."
00:22:46,00:22:48,"- London has a thing called Scoot,"
00:22:48,00:22:51,which is smart traffic lights.
00:22:51,00:22:54,And they can let certain cars and trucks
00:22:54,00:22:56,and people go through depending on
00:22:56,00:22:58,what's best for the environment.
00:22:58,00:23:01,"So if there's like some really big, heavy goods vehicles"
00:23:01,00:23:02,"that are gonna go through London,"
00:23:02,00:23:04,they think we don't want to stay in central London
00:23:04,00:23:05,and clogging up the air.
00:23:05,00:23:07,So we're gonna kind of give them a bit of a free run
00:23:07,00:23:09,on the green lights.
00:23:09,00:23:11,And that's using smart cameras
00:23:11,00:23:13,and all that kind of stuff that they can do that.
00:23:13,00:23:14,- That's so cool.
00:23:14,00:23:16,"- I know, and they have a similar one in Amsterdam,"
00:23:16,00:23:17,which can talk to your phone.
00:23:17,00:23:22,They can give cyclist priority when it's raining.
00:23:22,00:23:23,- Wow.
00:23:23,00:23:25,"- That's so amazing, yeah."
00:23:25,00:23:28,- The Dutch are so far ahead of the day.
00:23:28,00:23:29,- They're kind of thinking to stop this.
00:23:29,00:23:31,"In fact, they might have recently stopped it"
00:23:31,00:23:33,because they hadn't really thought about the privacy risks
00:23:33,00:23:35,of being able to see where everyone's going all the time.
00:23:35,00:23:37,- What's the harm?
00:23:37,00:23:38,- A few people have complained about it.
00:23:38,00:23:39,"So I'm not sure if it's still going,"
00:23:39,00:23:41,but for a while that was definitely the case.
00:23:41,00:23:43,- There's people who were cycling home from their lover's house.
00:23:43,00:23:44,And that's how they got busted.
00:23:44,00:23:47,- I don't know from the big Dutch bonkathon.
00:23:47,00:23:48,"- Well, I just wonder if that's,"
00:23:48,00:23:51,if there's a hidden sort of like air traffic control system
00:23:51,00:23:53,"that's used for say like,"
00:23:53,00:23:54,if there's a major incident
00:23:54,00:23:55,and you need ambulances to get through.
00:23:55,00:23:57,- In America they have that.
00:23:57,00:23:58,"But in the UK, we don't have it"
00:23:58,00:24:00,because ambulances just go through red lights.
00:24:00,00:24:02,So we don't need it.
00:24:02,00:24:04,"- But there is, again, in the Netherlands,"
00:24:04,00:24:07,"there's a traffic light system in,"
00:24:07,00:24:08,"oh gosh, I can pronounce it wrong,"
00:24:08,00:24:12,"Hertogenbosch, which has all these detection loops"
00:24:12,00:24:15,like plugged into the whole town software.
00:24:15,00:24:17,So all the city buses have these transponders on
00:24:17,00:24:19,which talk to the junctions.
00:24:19,00:24:20,"If the bus is running on time,"
00:24:20,00:24:21,the light works as normal.
00:24:21,00:24:23,"If the bus is running late,"
00:24:23,00:24:26,the lights change to give the bus priority.
00:24:26,00:24:27,"And if the bus is early, the light says,"
00:24:27,00:24:28,"yeah, you can hold on."
00:24:28,00:24:29,- The light just stops the bus for the sake of it.
00:24:29,00:24:31,- It stops the bus and lets the other traffic through first.
00:24:31,00:24:34,"- Well, this is the explosive thing."
00:24:34,00:24:35,"I realized about this country,"
00:24:35,00:24:37,"is that, yeah, we don't have it with emergency vehicles,"
00:24:37,00:24:39,"whereas America does, which, and I should say,"
00:24:39,00:24:41,"'cause I read so many forums with ambulance people saying,"
00:24:41,00:24:43,we never go through red lights unless it's safe.
00:24:43,00:24:45,"So, you know, it was really nilly."
00:24:45,00:24:47,- Of course we don't.
00:24:47,00:24:48,"- But, no, no, of course not."
00:24:48,00:24:50,- We're gonna need a few more ambulances out there.
00:24:50,00:24:54,"We've got them in great time, but."
00:24:54,00:24:58,- We have left a trail of destruction.
00:24:58,00:25:00,"But, you know, who can't override red lights"
00:25:00,00:25:03,"whenever they want, the buses in this country"
00:25:03,00:25:05,- It's so cool.
00:25:05,00:25:06,- What?
00:25:06,00:25:08,"- So, if a bus has the appropriate technology,"
00:25:08,00:25:09,which is the bus radio link.
00:25:09,00:25:11,- I think you're thinking of cyclists.
00:25:11,00:25:13,(laughing)
00:25:13,00:25:16,You're always hopping on the back of passing cyclists
00:25:16,00:25:17,and tapping them with your oyster card
00:25:17,00:25:20,but staying on until you've reached your destination.
00:25:20,00:25:22,- This is true.
00:25:22,00:25:25,"They have certain different bits of tech that come to it,"
00:25:25,00:25:28,"but one of them is bus priority radio link,"
00:25:28,00:25:29,which communicates with traffic lights.
00:25:29,00:25:31,"So, if you're on the bus, you have this radio link"
00:25:31,00:25:34,"that says, I'm coming along, I'm a bus,"
00:25:34,00:25:35,let the light stay green for me
00:25:35,00:25:37,and the light will stay green for the bus.
00:25:37,00:25:39,"'Cause again, it's better because buses are more efficient,"
00:25:39,00:25:40,"they're carrying more people,"
00:25:40,00:25:42,bad for the environment for them to stop and start.
00:25:42,00:25:43,"Sometimes you'll see,"
00:25:43,00:25:45,"and I really want to see one of these now,"
00:25:45,00:25:48,a sensor on the road before traffic lights
00:25:48,00:25:49,and it's a bus sensor.
00:25:49,00:25:51,And I think they're often at the bus stop
00:25:51,00:25:53,just before the lights on the bus stop
00:25:53,00:25:55,and it senses that a bus has gone past
00:25:55,00:25:57,"and it relays information to the traffic light saying,"
00:25:57,00:25:59,"if you're on green, stay on green for a bit longer"
00:25:59,00:26:02,"'cause bus is coming, let him through."
00:26:02,00:26:04,These buses are getting away with murder.
00:26:04,00:26:08,"Police cars are there, sitting in it for lights."
00:26:08,00:26:10,- Such a miserable response.
00:26:10,00:26:12,I am being cheated here by this bus
00:26:12,00:26:14,getting through efficiently.
00:26:14,00:26:16,"- My Ferrari, happy to see it idling."
00:26:16,00:26:19,"- Okay, which is better?"
00:26:19,00:26:23,Reversing into a parking space or going in face first?
00:26:23,00:26:24,- I have this argument with my husband all the time.
00:26:24,00:26:26,- I always go in face first.
00:26:26,00:26:29,"- I was reverse, I wonder if it's a gender thing."
00:26:29,00:26:32,- I don't believe it's easier to reverse into any spot.
00:26:32,00:26:35,"- All right, you're doing the challenge."
00:26:35,00:26:38,"- Because then I reverse coming out, don't I?"
00:26:38,00:26:41,- We both have to reverse at some stage.
00:26:41,00:26:43,Although my dream is I drive in straight
00:26:43,00:26:45,and then the person in front of me
00:26:45,00:26:46,and the other parking spot leaves
00:26:46,00:26:49,and I can just go straight through the parking spots.
00:26:49,00:26:51,- That's a great day when that happens.
00:26:51,00:26:53,I knew this would be a hot button topic.
00:26:53,00:26:54,And if you're listening at home
00:26:54,00:26:56,and you've got opinions about whether you reverse
00:26:56,00:26:57,it or go face first.
00:26:57,00:26:58,"- Okay, here's another reason why you should do"
00:26:58,00:27:00,what Anna does.
00:27:00,00:27:02,Reversing out of a parking space is more dangerous
00:27:02,00:27:04,because there are people walking around there.
00:27:04,00:27:04,- Bingo.
00:27:04,00:27:06,- Whereas it's unlikely there's someone walking
00:27:06,00:27:06,in your parking spot.
00:27:06,00:27:07,- Exactly that.
00:27:07,00:27:10,So there is a writer called Tom Vanderbilt
00:27:10,00:27:12,who's an American traffic writer.
00:27:12,00:27:15,"And basically, particularly in America,"
00:27:15,00:27:16,"which is where he's focused on,"
00:27:16,00:27:19,"there are loads of crashes, you know,"
00:27:19,00:27:21,some of them fatal in car parks.
00:27:21,00:27:22,"And it's because people,"
00:27:22,00:27:23,and it's also because American cars
00:27:23,00:27:25,are way bigger than European ones.
00:27:25,00:27:27,"People just get in, they reverse out,"
00:27:27,00:27:29,visibility's much reduced.
00:27:29,00:27:33,"However, there are some places where it is illegal"
00:27:33,00:27:36,in America to reverse into a parking space.
00:27:36,00:27:36,- Really?
00:27:36,00:27:37,- What?
00:27:37,00:27:38,- I know.
00:27:38,00:27:41,"- There's a city in California called San Luis Obispo,"
00:27:41,00:27:42,"I'm sure I'm saying that wrong too,"
00:27:42,00:27:44,which has made it illegal to reverse into a space.
00:27:44,00:27:45,I don't know.
00:27:45,00:27:46,- Everyone who lives there is a woman
00:27:46,00:27:48,"in a 1950s sexist joke, aren't they?"
00:27:48,00:27:51,So it's just chaos.
00:27:51,00:27:53,- It's clearly safer to do the opposite
00:27:53,00:27:55,"of the law in this place, which is nuts."
00:27:55,00:27:56,"- It must be the fights, right?"
00:27:56,00:27:58,"Because you, in order to reverse it,"
00:27:58,00:28:00,you have to pass the spot.
00:28:00,00:28:03,"And then it's like you've changed your mind,"
00:28:03,00:28:04,"they're going, actually, I'm gonna,"
00:28:04,00:28:08,"and they're going, no, I'm a front parker."
00:28:08,00:28:09,"Yeah, I think that's probably it."
00:28:09,00:28:10,- Can I say one last thing
00:28:10,00:28:13,about an effect of traffic changes?
00:28:13,00:28:18,"So, New York City has just a little bit of glamour,"
00:28:18,00:28:20,has just introduced a congestion charge.
00:28:20,00:28:21,- Okay.
00:28:21,00:28:23,"- Yeah, very late."
00:28:23,00:28:26,"London had it about, what, 15, 20 years ago, you know?"
00:28:26,00:28:27,"- Well, Durham had it before that."
00:28:27,00:28:28,"So, yeah. - Did it?"
00:28:28,00:28:29,"Oh, nice, okay."
00:28:29,00:28:30,"Well, New York has finally caught up"
00:28:30,00:28:31,with Swing and Durham
00:28:31,00:28:33,and brought in a congestion charge.
00:28:33,00:28:36,"And it's like, it's only a month or two in,"
00:28:36,00:28:39,"and it's, you know, politically sort of much vexed"
00:28:39,00:28:40,"'cause some people are saying,"
00:28:40,00:28:41,"""Oh, it's terrible, it's woke, blah, blah, blah."""
00:28:41,00:28:43,But it's cut down traffic a massive amount.
00:28:43,00:28:45,"Like, it's just journeys are much smoother now."
00:28:45,00:28:47,"But the other weird effect it's had,"
00:28:47,00:28:51,it's cut down another thing that's common in New York.
00:28:51,00:28:52,What's it called then? - Honking.
00:28:52,00:28:53,- Honking.
00:28:53,00:28:54,"- Oh, very good. - Okay."
00:28:54,00:28:57,Honk-related complaints are down 70%.
00:28:57,00:28:59,"- Oh, really? - 70%."
00:28:59,00:29:01,- Wow. - Is that just car honking?
00:29:01,00:29:03,Or is it also people pretending
00:29:03,00:29:04,to grab people's breasts?
00:29:04,00:29:05,(laughing)
00:29:05,00:29:07,"- Well, no, actually, those are up hugely, sadly."
00:29:07,00:29:09,(laughing)
00:29:09,00:29:11,"I also load the number of instances of people saying,"
00:29:11,00:29:12,"""I'm walking here."""
00:29:12,00:29:13,"- Oh, that's to cars?"
00:29:13,00:29:16,"- That's tragically down, 94%, really sad."
00:29:16,00:29:18,(upbeat music)
00:29:21,00:29:24,"- Okay, it is time for fact number three and that is James."
00:29:24,00:29:27,"- Okay, my fact this week is that bacteria eat clouds."
00:29:27,00:29:30,(laughing)
00:29:30,00:29:32,"So it turns out, up in the sky,"
00:29:32,00:29:35,"there's a lot of stuff living up there, lots of stuff."
00:29:35,00:29:38,And a lot of it is very small.
00:29:38,00:29:43,"So, you know, fungal spores, viruses, and bacteria."
00:29:43,00:29:46,"And the bacteria, how they can live up there for so long"
00:29:46,00:29:50,is that they get their energy from the little bits
00:29:50,00:29:51,that make clouds.
00:29:51,00:29:54,"So, if you think about it, a cloud is made out of water,"
00:29:54,00:29:55,right? - Mm-hmm.
00:29:55,00:29:57,- But the water can't just stay up there by itself.
00:29:57,00:29:59,It needs to get around something.
00:29:59,00:30:01,So there's little bits of dust.
00:30:01,00:30:04,"There might be little bits of dead animals up there,"
00:30:04,00:30:07,"little bits of, you know, dead fungal spores,"
00:30:07,00:30:08,something like that.
00:30:08,00:30:09,"- Little bits of dead animals,"
00:30:09,00:30:09,like the leg of a rabbit.
00:30:09,00:30:11,(laughing)
00:30:11,00:30:14,- The roadkill that the planes hit on there up there.
00:30:14,00:30:15,(laughing)
00:30:15,00:30:16,- Tiny cellular.
00:30:16,00:30:18,"- I meant tiny cellular things, yeah,"
00:30:18,00:30:20,as opposed to a trunk of an elephant.
00:30:20,00:30:23,"But yeah, so that stuff might be made of carbon,"
00:30:23,00:30:26,and the bacteria can use this carbon
00:30:26,00:30:30,"to make a molecule called adenosine triphosphate, or ATP,"
00:30:30,00:30:32,"which is basically what we all use,"
00:30:32,00:30:34,what all living-- - How mitochondria?
00:30:34,00:30:36,"- Yeah, all living things use it to create energy,"
00:30:36,00:30:39,and they get theirs from this stuff that's in clouds.
00:30:39,00:30:40,"- Yeah, cool. - It's sort of,"
00:30:40,00:30:43,"I always thought these are nucleators,"
00:30:43,00:30:44,the little bits that clouds gather around it.
00:30:44,00:30:47,"I always thought they were mainly dust and bits of earth,"
00:30:47,00:30:49,"and basically water attaches them,"
00:30:49,00:30:52,"forms ice around them, and that's clouds."
00:30:52,00:30:55,"But actually, up to 100% of them in some places,"
00:30:55,00:30:56,and the vast majority are biological.
00:30:56,00:30:59,So it's largely the corpses of other bacteria
00:30:59,00:31:00,that bacteria are eating.
00:31:00,00:31:04,"- Yeah, and a lot of dust is, like,"
00:31:04,00:31:06,"comes from bacteria or-- - Yeah, used to be alive."
00:31:06,00:31:08,"- It's wild to think, though, that when it rains,"
00:31:08,00:31:09,there's an estimate that says a single square meter
00:31:09,00:31:13,of ground gets pelted with 100 million bacteria
00:31:13,00:31:14,during every hour of rainstorm.
00:31:14,00:31:16,"- Yeah, I-- - So you're being rained"
00:31:16,00:31:18,on by bacteria. - 'Cause I don't really like
00:31:18,00:31:21,"using umbrellas, 'cause I feel like it's a bit soft,"
00:31:21,00:31:24,"and so I can always go out in the rain,"
00:31:24,00:31:25,"and I'm just kind of happy to get wet,"
00:31:25,00:31:26,"and also, 'cause I'm from Bolton,"
00:31:26,00:31:29,I feel like it reminds me of home when it rains.
00:31:29,00:31:30,"- Yeah, right. - But now that I know"
00:31:30,00:31:32,"all that bacteria is coming down as well,"
00:31:32,00:31:34,I feel like I might have to use an umbrella.
00:31:34,00:31:35,"- Oh, you're being mad at me. - But now you know"
00:31:35,00:31:37,you're being bombarded with fungal spores.
00:31:37,00:31:38,- I know. - Yeah.
00:31:38,00:31:40,"- Yeah, you've got a real two mixed signals coming in there."
00:31:40,00:31:41,"That's so huge, James."
00:31:41,00:31:44,I recently considered buying a second umbrella stand.
00:31:44,00:31:47,(laughing)
00:31:47,00:31:49,"- Honestly, if anyone listening wants to know"
00:31:49,00:31:50,"the difference between me and Abby,"
00:31:50,00:31:51,that pretty much sums us up.
00:31:51,00:31:53,(laughing)
00:31:53,00:31:55,"- It's pretty wild, though, that it's not just the rain,"
00:31:55,00:31:58,that I grew up by the beaches in Australia.
00:31:58,00:32:02,Every crashing wave was pumping bacteria into my face.
00:32:02,00:32:04,"I just didn't know that. - It's crazy, 'cause I always go"
00:32:04,00:32:06,"swimming completely naked, 'cause I think if you wear"
00:32:06,00:32:09,"a swimsuit, that's soft. (laughing)"
00:32:09,00:32:11,"- Now you're burkini, aren't you?"
00:32:11,00:32:14,"- I read a piece, which I'm sure you guys all did,"
00:32:14,00:32:17,which was printed in microbiology today in 2005.
00:32:17,00:32:19,- I'd read it before. (laughing)
00:32:19,00:32:20,I'm really visited.
00:32:20,00:32:22,"- This was a fantastic, I just wanted to give a shout out"
00:32:22,00:32:23,to Dale Griffin.
00:32:23,00:32:25,"I don't know if he's still training or still listening,"
00:32:25,00:32:29,but it's about soil moving across the earth every year.
00:32:29,00:32:30,I just want to read you the quote.
00:32:30,00:32:32,The current estimate of the soil moving some distance
00:32:32,00:32:34,in the earth's atmosphere each year
00:32:34,00:32:38,is approximately three billion metric tons.
00:32:38,00:32:42,"If that was converted into 1964 Volkswagen Beetles,"
00:32:42,00:32:44,"based on weight and dimensions,"
00:32:44,00:32:45,there would be enough beetles to create
00:32:45,00:32:48,a 42 kilometer tall tower with base area equivalent
00:32:48,00:32:51,"to the walled city of Chester, UK."
00:32:51,00:32:53,- Oh my God. (laughing)
00:32:53,00:32:55,"- Mate. - So, hang on."
00:32:55,00:32:59,- So think about that. (laughing)
00:32:59,00:33:01,- I'm struggling to pick that. - So the amount of soil--
00:33:01,00:33:02,- Did we need the beetles in there?
00:33:02,00:33:05,Couldn't we just have the soil making the tower?
00:33:05,00:33:07,"- No, no, no, because the soil is denser than beetles."
00:33:07,00:33:10,"The soil is converted, three billion tons of soil,"
00:33:10,00:33:12,converting to three billion tons of Volkswagen Beetles.
00:33:12,00:33:14,You can't stay inside of a Volkswagen Beetle
00:33:14,00:33:15,is not full of soil.
00:33:15,00:33:17,"- No, not unless you've been doing"
00:33:17,00:33:19,some very heavy driving. (laughing)
00:33:19,00:33:22,"- Interesting, okay, well, I say interesting."
00:33:22,00:33:25,"It's a cool tower, yeah. (laughing)"
00:33:25,00:33:26,- Do we need Chester any more?
00:33:26,00:33:29,Wouldn't it be better to have a 42 kilometer tall tower?
00:33:29,00:33:32,"- Tea hailstorms, you know about these?"
00:33:32,00:33:34,- No. - Tea plantations?
00:33:34,00:33:35,- Yes. - Oh.
00:33:35,00:33:37,- They're more common hailstorms over tea plantations.
00:33:37,00:33:40,And it was this really big mystery in 1979.
00:33:40,00:33:42,There was a scientist in Kenya
00:33:42,00:33:45,who was aware that the world record of hailstorms
00:33:45,00:33:46,was on Kenyan tea plantations.
00:33:46,00:33:49,They got 132 days of them a year.
00:33:49,00:33:50,- Wow.
00:33:50,00:33:52,- Which is a lot of hail and didn't know why.
00:33:52,00:33:54,And it turns out it's all the tea pickers fault.
00:33:54,00:33:56,"Basically, as they walk through the tea plantation"
00:33:56,00:33:59,"picking the tea, they kick up bits of leaf,"
00:33:59,00:34:01,bits of dead tea leaf into the air.
00:34:01,00:34:03,And there's a bacteria in tea leaf
00:34:03,00:34:06,that attaches itself to the leaves as they rot
00:34:06,00:34:08,and they're flawless hail nucleators.
00:34:08,00:34:11,"So, as you kick up the tea leaves into the air,"
00:34:11,00:34:12,"you free up these bacteria,"
00:34:12,00:34:14,"they go straight up into the air,"
00:34:14,00:34:15,and they hail down again.
00:34:15,00:34:17,- Incredible. - Does it damage the tea?
00:34:17,00:34:18,"- Must do, right?"
00:34:18,00:34:18,"- It seems like it would,"
00:34:18,00:34:20,but it's not like they're constantly having
00:34:20,00:34:23,"to move the tea plantations to escape the hailstorms, so."
00:34:23,00:34:24,"- There's a scientist writer called,"
00:34:24,00:34:25,"I think he's called Zimmer,"
00:34:25,00:34:27,who's writing a lot about- - Kazema.
00:34:27,00:34:29,"- Kazema, and he writes a lot about these things"
00:34:29,00:34:33,which are collectively aeroplankton is the term for them.
00:34:33,00:34:37,And it contributes a huge amount to the circle of life.
00:34:37,00:34:41,"So, there's a bacteria called Pseudomonas,"
00:34:41,00:34:43,and it's very good at turning water to ice
00:34:43,00:34:45,or helping water turn to ice.
00:34:45,00:34:48,"And so, when a plant is covered in this stuff on the ground"
00:34:48,00:34:50,"with these bacteria and rain lands,"
00:34:50,00:34:53,"the Pseudomonas bacteria turn the water twice,"
00:34:53,00:34:55,"the leaf cracks open,"
00:34:55,00:34:57,"and the bacteria can then get inside the leaf,"
00:34:57,00:34:57,"which is what it's trying to do,"
00:34:57,00:34:59,it's trying to feed on the leaf.
00:34:59,00:35:02,"So, that's what the bacteria's function is,"
00:35:02,00:35:03,and it sort of damages the plant.
00:35:03,00:35:07,"But, clouds containing those bacteria rain more,"
00:35:07,00:35:11,and it might be that that helps plants grow
00:35:11,00:35:12,because plants need rain to grow.
00:35:12,00:35:15,"So, actually, everyone's helping everyone in this world."
00:35:15,00:35:17,"- So, they're kind of happy to have this little bacteria"
00:35:17,00:35:18,"cracking open their leaves,"
00:35:18,00:35:20,"'cause they know by doing that,"
00:35:20,00:35:21,they're gonna get more rain.
00:35:21,00:35:22,- Exactly.
00:35:22,00:35:22,"And so, the thing is,"
00:35:22,00:35:26,"there are these kind of bacteria motorways in the sky,"
00:35:26,00:35:27,which is mapped.
00:35:27,00:35:28,These kind of-
00:35:28,00:35:29,"- They're traffic light controlled,"
00:35:29,00:35:31,or is it like a roundabout way system?
00:35:31,00:35:32,"- Well, there's this thing,"
00:35:32,00:35:34,the environment is called the Aerobiome.
00:35:34,00:35:37,"Like, outdoor above us is the Aerobiome."
00:35:37,00:35:41,"So, in cities, the Aerobiome is less diverse,"
00:35:41,00:35:42,"and there are fewer microbes,"
00:35:42,00:35:43,and then the countryside loads more microbes
00:35:43,00:35:44,"in the countryside,"
00:35:44,00:35:46,"and maybe this affects whether you get asthma,"
00:35:46,00:35:47,"you know, the environment you live in,"
00:35:47,00:35:50,"whether you breathe in more or fewer,"
00:35:50,00:35:52,all different kinds of these things sort of affects that.
00:35:52,00:35:55,"But, some scientists think that the 2001"
00:35:55,00:35:56,"foot and mouth outbreak in the UK,"
00:35:56,00:36:00,"which was cattle, livestock foot and mouth, not human one,"
00:36:00,00:36:03,"they think it might've been due to a storm in North Africa,"
00:36:03,00:36:05,"which may have carried spores north,"
00:36:05,00:36:07,"because a week after that storm,"
00:36:07,00:36:08,cases of foot and mouth started happening.
00:36:08,00:36:09,So-
00:36:09,00:36:10,- How interesting.
00:36:10,00:36:11,- Could be that.
00:36:11,00:36:12,"- And that's the Sahara, I think, wasn't it?"
00:36:12,00:36:14,Which gets blamed for a lot of stuff being carried.
00:36:14,00:36:16,I think it was from there that they thought
00:36:16,00:36:17,it might have come.
00:36:17,00:36:19,"'Cause similarly, I think we've talked before"
00:36:19,00:36:23,about how a lot of the sand in the Caribbean
00:36:23,00:36:25,"is blown over from the Sahara,"
00:36:25,00:36:28,"and there was this major coral disease in 1999,"
00:36:28,00:36:30,which killed off loads of Caribbean coral.
00:36:30,00:36:34,"It was a fungus called Aspergillus sidae,"
00:36:34,00:36:36,and it happened to coincide with all these dust storms
00:36:36,00:36:40,"in the Sahara, and this fungus lived in the Sahara Desert,"
00:36:40,00:36:43,"been picked up, blown all the way over to the Caribbean,"
00:36:43,00:36:45,"killed a bunch of coral, bloody Sahara Desert."
00:36:45,00:36:46,"- I read something about this,"
00:36:46,00:36:48,"which I don't have in my notes, 'cause it was years ago,"
00:36:48,00:36:51,"but I think there's an underwater cave in the Caribbean,"
00:36:51,00:36:56,which is one of the best places to study old sand
00:36:56,00:37:00,"from the Sahara, because it flies over there."
00:37:00,00:37:03,"It hits the water, it goes down, it gets into this cave,"
00:37:03,00:37:04,"and it's kind of stuck there,"
00:37:04,00:37:06,"and no one can contaminate it or anything,"
00:37:06,00:37:08,and I think it's called the Dam Cave.
00:37:08,00:37:09,"- Oh, wow."
00:37:09,00:37:11,"- I think, from memory."
00:37:11,00:37:14,"- That feels like an enterprising scientist has said,"
00:37:14,00:37:16,"""Well, I need to study the Sahara,"
00:37:16,00:37:18,"""but I'm going to need to study from the Caribbean."""
00:37:18,00:37:21,(laughing)
00:37:21,00:37:22,And that's incredible.
00:37:22,00:37:23,- I think that's true.
00:37:23,00:37:24,- That is so good.
00:37:24,00:37:25,- The Dam Cave sounds like something
00:37:25,00:37:27,"so much more disgusting than that, actually."
00:37:27,00:37:28,- It's like a man cave.
00:37:28,00:37:29,- No offense.
00:37:29,00:37:29,- It's weird.
00:37:29,00:37:32,I always think you're like superhero back cave.
00:37:32,00:37:32,- That's where I went.
00:37:32,00:37:34,- You went straight for the Dirty Magazines.
00:37:34,00:37:35,- Yeah.
00:37:35,00:37:39,- I was actually thinking of rotting Nessie corpses and stuff.
00:37:39,00:37:40,(laughing)
00:37:40,00:37:42,- With me just wanking in the corner.
00:37:42,00:37:45,(laughing)
00:37:45,00:37:46,- There's no need for that.
00:37:46,00:37:48,- That's what my wife said.
00:37:48,00:37:50,(laughing)
00:37:50,00:37:52,(upbeat music)
00:37:52,00:37:57,"- Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show,"
00:37:57,00:37:58,and that is my fact.
00:37:58,00:38:01,"My fact this week is that number one selling singer,"
00:38:01,00:38:03,"Sabrina Carpenter,"
00:38:03,00:38:06,"is the niece of another number one selling singer,"
00:38:06,00:38:08,Bart Simpson.
00:38:08,00:38:10,- Wow.
00:38:10,00:38:11,"- It's a confusing fact, 'cause much like me,"
00:38:11,00:38:13,"none of you would have heard of this Sabrina Carpenter,"
00:38:13,00:38:15,"and you won't know the Bart Simpson,"
00:38:15,00:38:16,who's the leading singer.
00:38:16,00:38:16,- Who's the Bart Simpson fellow?
00:38:16,00:38:18,(laughing)
00:38:18,00:38:20,"Okay, so a lot of people will know"
00:38:20,00:38:22,that Sabrina Carpenter is one of the biggest pop stars
00:38:22,00:38:24,"in the world right now,"
00:38:24,00:38:27,and she has had a bunch of singles
00:38:27,00:38:28,that have gone to number one.
00:38:28,00:38:31,"Mia Espresso, for example, is one,"
00:38:31,00:38:36,"and it turns out that her auntie is Nancy Cartwright,"
00:38:36,00:38:38,"the voice of Bart Simpson,"
00:38:38,00:38:40,"who herself had a number one hit,"
00:38:40,00:38:42,would do the Bartman.
00:38:42,00:38:44,"- Can I just say, I read someone on Reddit,"
00:38:44,00:38:46,"someone called Blamennixson,"
00:38:46,00:38:50,saying that that makes Nancy Cartwright a carpenter aunt.
00:38:50,00:38:51,(laughing)
00:38:51,00:38:52,- 'Cause she's called Sabrina Carpenter.
00:38:52,00:38:55,"- And Carpenter aunties, and David for Species of Ant."
00:38:55,00:38:56,"- Nice, that's good."
00:38:56,00:38:57,- That's pretty good.
00:38:57,00:38:59,"- Oh, and Anne is a Northern pronunciation of aunt."
00:38:59,00:39:00,- Yes. - Yes.
00:39:00,00:39:01,"- Got it, thank you."
00:39:01,00:39:02,That was the missing link I needed.
00:39:02,00:39:03,"- I just thought it was a good joke,"
00:39:03,00:39:05,but not good enough that I was gonna claim it myself.
00:39:05,00:39:07,(laughing)
00:39:07,00:39:08,- You thought you'd buy the kite.
00:39:08,00:39:09,You could always edit out the Reddit bit
00:39:09,00:39:12,if it goes really well.
00:39:12,00:39:13,- Are you a fan of Sabrina Carpenter?
00:39:13,00:39:14,- Huge fan.
00:39:14,00:39:15,"- I thought you would be,"
00:39:15,00:39:16,'cause she's a big fan of Moss.
00:39:16,00:39:17,(gasping)
00:39:17,00:39:20,"The album cover of her last but one album,"
00:39:20,00:39:21,"""Email So I Can't Send,"""
00:39:21,00:39:24,was inspired by old photos of Kate Moss.
00:39:24,00:39:26,(laughing)
00:39:26,00:39:29,"- So who was it, was it someone from Reddit as well?"
00:39:29,00:39:29,- It's old mine.
00:39:29,00:39:31,(laughing)
00:39:31,00:39:32,"- Well, you have me going there."
00:39:32,00:39:35,- I really like Sabrina Carpenter.
00:39:35,00:39:35,- I think she's great as well.
00:39:35,00:39:37,"- I actually think you would like her,"
00:39:37,00:39:40,'cause who was the person we spoke about who sang--
00:39:40,00:39:42,"- Oh, it's my party."
00:39:42,00:39:43,- It's my party. - It's Leslie Gore.
00:39:43,00:39:45,"- Yeah, I think of her as a modern day Leslie Gore."
00:39:45,00:39:47,"- Oh, wow. - Her song, ""Please, Peace, Please,"""
00:39:47,00:39:50,I reckon is pretty much the modern version of that song.
00:39:50,00:39:52,- I'm always open to new talent.
00:39:52,00:39:53,- I'll give this girl a go.
00:39:53,00:39:55,I'll give her a go and see if maybe we can help her.
00:39:55,00:39:57,- Apparently she's doing fine without me.
00:39:57,00:39:58,She's doing okay.
00:39:58,00:40:00,- So was she the only one of the Carpenter's
00:40:00,00:40:02,who had a career after--
00:40:02,00:40:04,"- Oh, she's not current Carpenter's sister."
00:40:04,00:40:07,"- Yeah, she's not related to the Carpenter's."
00:40:07,00:40:09,"She, what we've got here is two people"
00:40:09,00:40:12,who live in the modern world and they've got me and Anna.
00:40:12,00:40:13,"- Well, let me give you a bit of background"
00:40:13,00:40:15,about Sabrina Carpenter.
00:40:15,00:40:19,"So Nancy Cartwright's step-brother is David Carpenter,"
00:40:19,00:40:21,who is Sabrina Carpenter's dad.
00:40:21,00:40:24,He is an x-ray servicing company member.
00:40:24,00:40:25,His-- - Sorry?
00:40:25,00:40:26,- Sorry?
00:40:26,00:40:27,- David Carpenter works--
00:40:27,00:40:29,- He's an x-ray servicing company member.
00:40:29,00:40:32,"- Yeah, it doesn't feel very important."
00:40:32,00:40:33,That fact is not real.
00:40:33,00:40:35,"- Well, I mean, you said it in the same way"
00:40:35,00:40:37,"that you would say, ""He's a teacher."""
00:40:37,00:40:39,"Or, ""Oh, he's a doctor."""
00:40:39,00:40:43,He's an x-ray servicing company member.
00:40:43,00:40:45,"Company member, right, okay."
00:40:45,00:40:48,"- If you ever meet someone like that at a party,"
00:40:48,00:40:50,"again, you're moving on to the next person."
00:40:50,00:40:51,"- Do you have my friend, Andy?"
00:40:51,00:40:54,"- I'm going home with the lobe muffler, that's the point."
00:40:54,00:40:56,(all laughing)
00:40:56,00:40:58,"Get your big trunk, you pulled."
00:40:58,00:41:00,(all laughing)
00:41:00,00:41:03,Her mum is a chiropractor.
00:41:03,00:41:06,"The reason I mentioned these two things,"
00:41:06,00:41:08,"the reason I mentioned it,"
00:41:08,00:41:09,"is because outside of Nancy Cartwright,"
00:41:09,00:41:12,there's no connection to the world of entertainment.
00:41:12,00:41:13,"- She's not a depot baby, right?"
00:41:13,00:41:15,"- Exactly, she's often accused of that"
00:41:15,00:41:16,"as a result of that connection,"
00:41:16,00:41:18,but they don't seem to be that.
00:41:18,00:41:19,"She started her freaking,"
00:41:19,00:41:21,she can get all the x-rays she wants.
00:41:21,00:41:22,(all laughing)
00:41:22,00:41:23,Anytime she likes.
00:41:23,00:41:27,"- Need your back clicked, you are in luck, my friend."
00:41:27,00:41:29,"- She released her first single,"
00:41:29,00:41:32,"which was called, ""Can't Blame a Girl for Trying,"""
00:41:32,00:41:34,one week after fish started.
00:41:34,00:41:37,So she is as old as fish for one week.
00:41:37,00:41:38,"Yeah, March 14th, 2014."
00:41:38,00:41:39,"- We should get a watch,"
00:41:39,00:41:41,we could have a joint birthday party.
00:41:41,00:41:41,"- Yeah, she's still got a week"
00:41:41,00:41:43,to catch up and be as big as us.
00:41:43,00:41:44,Is that what I'm saying?
00:41:44,00:41:45,(all laughing)
00:41:45,00:41:50,"- She started off, she did a Miley Cyrus singing competition"
00:41:50,00:41:52,when she was 10 years old.
00:41:52,00:41:53,And she's-- - We're gonna have
00:41:53,00:41:54,to explain to her.
00:41:54,00:41:55,- Oh my God.
00:41:55,00:41:59,"- She know Billy Ray Cyrus, her dad was Billy Ray Cyrus."
00:41:59,00:42:00,- Right.
00:42:00,00:42:03,- Who worked in the musicals.
00:42:03,00:42:04,- He was an x-ray guy.
00:42:04,00:42:05,- That's right.
00:42:05,00:42:07,But it was like a competition
00:42:07,00:42:09,"for Miley Cyrus fan club members,"
00:42:09,00:42:12,"but it was kind of voted for by people,"
00:42:12,00:42:13,it was one of those early internet things.
00:42:13,00:42:17,And it was mentioned in loads of her local newspapers.
00:42:17,00:42:19,"And they basically said vote for her, vote for her, vote for her."
00:42:19,00:42:22,"So she got down to the final, like three or four people."
00:42:22,00:42:23,And she was only 10 years old
00:42:23,00:42:25,and everyone else was like older teenagers doing it.
00:42:25,00:42:27,"- So was that when she started out,"
00:42:27,00:42:29,when fish was--
00:42:29,00:42:30,"- Yeah, well actually-- - That would be earlier."
00:42:30,00:42:31,"- Oh, okay."
00:42:31,00:42:32,"- Yeah, that was earlier."
00:42:32,00:42:33,And then she went on to YouTube
00:42:33,00:42:34,'cause she got big on this competition
00:42:34,00:42:36,and put a load of songs on YouTube
00:42:36,00:42:38,and then got massive on YouTube.
00:42:38,00:42:40,Then she got picked up by the Disney club or someone.
00:42:40,00:42:42,"- Yeah, she did a show called Girl Meets World,"
00:42:42,00:42:44,"which I think was a reboot of Boy Meets World,"
00:42:44,00:42:46,which is a big show when I was a teenager.
00:42:46,00:42:48,"She was cast as the lead character,"
00:42:48,00:42:49,the Lindsay Lohan character
00:42:49,00:42:53,and the mean girl's musical that Tina Fey did on stage.
00:42:53,00:42:56,So she had a bit of a career ahead of it.
00:42:56,00:42:57,And then she did this.
00:42:57,00:42:59,- A lot of slogging away before you're an overnight success.
00:42:59,00:43:00,- Exactly.
00:43:00,00:43:01,- That's what we felt.
00:43:01,00:43:02,- Is this like an ad crossover swap
00:43:02,00:43:05,is she gonna release a song about no such thing as a bitch?
00:43:05,00:43:06,And that's saying for this party.
00:43:06,00:43:08,"- Yeah, I gotta say."
00:43:08,00:43:09,"- Come on, it's like,"
00:43:09,00:43:11,we're not expecting any publicity back
00:43:11,00:43:13,from the traffic lights into Shaggy.
00:43:13,00:43:15,(all laughing)
00:43:15,00:43:16,- Nancy Cartwright.
00:43:16,00:43:17,- Oh yeah.
00:43:17,00:43:20,- Is this disappointing or am I being judgmental?
00:43:20,00:43:21,She's big on Scientology.
00:43:21,00:43:24,"I know they all are, but she's really big."
00:43:24,00:43:25,- What do you mean they all are?
00:43:25,00:43:25,- All the famous people.
00:43:25,00:43:27,- All the famous people.
00:43:27,00:43:29,(all laughing)
00:43:29,00:43:31,- Have you not seen the roof of Mo's cavern?
00:43:31,00:43:35,It's one of those big pyramid wire things that you wear.
00:43:35,00:43:39,"- She, Cartwright was awarded in 2023,"
00:43:39,00:43:42,the status of patron Excalibur with honors
00:43:42,00:43:43,"by the Church of Scientology,"
00:43:43,00:43:45,which she called the most beautiful acknowledgement
00:43:45,00:43:47,"I've ever received in my life,"
00:43:47,00:43:51,which I think is really weird to appreciate that.
00:43:51,00:43:52,"'Cause the reason she's got it,"
00:43:52,00:43:54,I assume is that she's donated $20 million
00:43:54,00:43:55,to the Church of Scientology.
00:43:55,00:43:57,- So where the Simpsons money goes?
00:43:57,00:43:58,- That's where it's going.
00:43:58,00:43:59,"- Well, there's a lot of Simpsons money, isn't it?"
00:43:59,00:44:00,"- Yeah, absolutely."
00:44:00,00:44:02,"I mean, this album that you're talking about down,"
00:44:02,00:44:05,this was The Simpsons Sing the Blues released in 1990.
00:44:05,00:44:07,"- This is the, Nancy Cartwright."
00:44:07,00:44:07,"- Oh, I'm sorry."
00:44:07,00:44:08,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:44:08,00:44:09,- I threw the Batman on it.
00:44:09,00:44:11,"- Exactly, that was the first track."
00:44:11,00:44:13,"And that sold in the UK, it's on 400,000 copies."
00:44:13,00:44:14,"- Yeah, I remember it was absolutely Monday."
00:44:14,00:44:16,"- Yeah, well, yeah, it went to number one here,"
00:44:16,00:44:18,"but it didn't in America, oddly."
00:44:18,00:44:21,And what's weird is it was only played on Sky One
00:44:21,00:44:23,"at this point, The Simpsons in the UK."
00:44:23,00:44:25,"So for overseas listeners, that's a sort of,"
00:44:25,00:44:26,what do you call that?
00:44:26,00:44:27,- You have to pay for it.
00:44:27,00:44:29,"- Yeah, it's a pay for channel, so quite wild."
00:44:29,00:44:30,- The album sounds very good.
00:44:30,00:44:32,It's got lots of great musicians on it.
00:44:32,00:44:34,"BB King, Dr. John, DJ Jazzy Jeff."
00:44:34,00:44:38,"I mean, these are my people, I don't know if they're with."
00:44:38,00:44:40,- It was listed that Michael Jackson
00:44:40,00:44:41,"was the composer of Do The Batman,"
00:44:41,00:44:42,"which I think we might've said on this show,"
00:44:42,00:44:44,and I believe that's not actually true.
00:44:44,00:44:45,- Yes.
00:44:45,00:44:47,"- A guy called Brian, Brian Lauren."
00:44:47,00:44:49,But it got sold two million copies in the USA.
00:44:49,00:44:51,"I mean, it was a really,"
00:44:51,00:44:54,I think people forget how massive The Simpsons was.
00:44:54,00:44:55,- Yeah.
00:44:55,00:44:56,- The biggest cartoon ever.
00:44:56,00:44:56,- Yeah.
00:44:56,00:45:00,"- Well, until the new Chinese movie, ""Nasia."""
00:45:00,00:45:02,- I can't take another pop-cotch reference.
00:45:02,00:45:03,(all laughing)
00:45:03,00:45:05,"- It's just there's a new animated movie,"
00:45:05,00:45:08,which is the biggest animated movie of all time.
00:45:08,00:45:09,It literally came out this week.
00:45:09,00:45:10,That's it.
00:45:10,00:45:11,"- Oh, wow."
00:45:11,00:45:11,- Will that be The Simpsons movie?
00:45:11,00:45:12,- Yeah.
00:45:12,00:45:13,"- Probably, yeah."
00:45:13,00:45:16,"- Nancy Korrow, by the way, before she was Bart,"
00:45:16,00:45:18,she did various different roles.
00:45:18,00:45:20,"So she did, in my little pony,"
00:45:20,00:45:22,she did a voice that was quite similar to Bart Simpson.
00:45:22,00:45:25,"But probably for me, most iconically,"
00:45:25,00:45:28,"she did the voice of, if you remember who framed Roger Rabbit,"
00:45:28,00:45:33,there's a moment where there is a shoe being dipped
00:45:33,00:45:34,into a vat of acid.
00:45:34,00:45:35,That's her.
00:45:35,00:45:36,- Brilliant.
00:45:36,00:45:37,- That's Nancy Korrow.
00:45:37,00:45:39,- It's quite a seminal bit of that movie.
00:45:39,00:45:40,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:45:40,00:45:41,- I don't think that's even on a Wikipedia page.
00:45:41,00:45:43,You need to get that up there.
00:45:43,00:45:43,(all laughing)
00:45:43,00:45:44,- That's funny.
00:45:44,00:45:46,"- Guys, who's the main creator of The Simpsons"
00:45:46,00:45:47,that comes up?
00:45:47,00:45:48,- Matt Groening.
00:45:48,00:45:48,- Groening.
00:45:48,00:45:49,- Groening.
00:45:49,00:45:50,- Groening.
00:45:50,00:45:51,- Not him.
00:45:51,00:45:52,"- Sorry, it is."
00:45:52,00:45:55,I just can't believe I've been saying Groening all these years.
00:45:55,00:45:57,You see that name so much.
00:45:57,00:45:58,You think Groening is Groening.
00:45:58,00:45:59,- Groening.
00:45:59,00:46:00,- Do you know what his parents called?
00:46:00,00:46:01,"- Oh, it'll be."
00:46:01,00:46:03,- Mr. and Mrs. Groening.
00:46:03,00:46:04,- Wouldn't it be like Homer and Marge?
00:46:04,00:46:05,- It's Homer and Marge.
00:46:05,00:46:07,"- Is it? - Yeah, yeah."
00:46:07,00:46:11,"- His dad's a consultant radiology company member,"
00:46:11,00:46:11,isn't he?
00:46:11,00:46:13,(all laughing)
00:46:13,00:46:14,Yeah.
00:46:14,00:46:16,The effects it had in the early years was brilliant.
00:46:16,00:46:17,I just love all the things.
00:46:17,00:46:19,'Cause there was a time where The Simpsons
00:46:19,00:46:20,was really big in the news.
00:46:20,00:46:21,"And I know they're still making it now,"
00:46:21,00:46:23,but there was a time where like it prompted big headlines.
00:46:23,00:46:25,"So in 1996, The New York Times reported"
00:46:25,00:46:29,that there was a mega glut of saxophony
00:46:29,00:46:30,happening in America.
00:46:30,00:46:32,All children wanted to learn the saxophone
00:46:32,00:46:33,because of Lisa Simpson.
00:46:33,00:46:34,"- Yeah, makes sense."
00:46:34,00:46:36,"- Sax teachers said, they interviewed the sax teachers"
00:46:36,00:46:39,"who said, this is just, you know, it's a nightmare."
00:46:39,00:46:41,They would have a whole band of saxophone students.
00:46:41,00:46:44,"- This is like, who are we talking about last week,"
00:46:44,00:46:46,the farmers who complain when they get too big a yield?
00:46:46,00:46:47,- The saffron.
00:46:47,00:46:48,"- Yeah, the saffron farmers,"
00:46:48,00:46:50,"bloody saxophone teacher, Killjoy."
00:46:50,00:46:51,"- Sorry, band leaders were furious about this"
00:46:51,00:46:54,"'cause they, you know, they desperately needed a piccolo"
00:46:54,00:46:55,and all they got was a thousand saxophones.
00:46:55,00:46:56,"- Ah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:46:56,00:46:57,"- Yeah, that makes sense."
00:46:57,00:46:58,"- And they interviewed one who said,"
00:46:58,00:47:00,"also due to the fact that if you go to the movies,"
00:47:00,00:47:02,it's always the sax playing the steamy part
00:47:02,00:47:04,when there's something interesting going on on the screen.
00:47:04,00:47:05,- Saxy.
00:47:05,00:47:06,- Saxy stuff.
00:47:06,00:47:07,- That's very cool.
00:47:07,00:47:08,- Also Bill Clinton and Kenny G.
00:47:08,00:47:09,"- Oh, yes."
00:47:09,00:47:10,"- Oh, gosh."
00:47:10,00:47:13,"- The two sexiest men ever to live, sex."
00:47:13,00:47:17,- So the reason I said Homer and Marsh before
00:47:17,00:47:20,is 'cause I do know that fact that he named all the characters
00:47:20,00:47:22,"after his family except for Bart,"
00:47:22,00:47:24,which was an anagram of brat
00:47:24,00:47:27,and he sort of came up with it in the moment.
00:47:27,00:47:29,"But I was reading up on his sister, Lisa,"
00:47:29,00:47:33,"Grainning, and she..."
00:47:33,00:47:34,- Scraining.
00:47:34,00:47:39,"- Grainning, she married a man called Craig Bartlett."
00:47:39,00:47:42,- Which part of the radiology department?
00:47:42,00:47:47,- Craig Bartlett is the creator of another show
00:47:47,00:47:50,"that's called Hey Arnold, which is a massive show."
00:47:50,00:47:51,- I love Hey Arnold.
00:47:51,00:47:53,"- Yeah, and Dinosaur Train was a more recent one,"
00:47:53,00:47:55,which my son grew up on.
00:47:55,00:47:59,"But yeah, so that is a real powerhouse of a family."
00:47:59,00:48:01,A cartoon connection.
00:48:01,00:48:02,- He also named a lot of characters in The Simpsons
00:48:02,00:48:04,after places he knew about.
00:48:04,00:48:06,"So he grew up in Portland, in Oregon."
00:48:06,00:48:09,"And streets where he grew up,"
00:48:09,00:48:11,"and where he grew up included Flanders Street,"
00:48:11,00:48:13,a Simpsons character.
00:48:13,00:48:15,"Lovejoy Street, Reverend Lovejoy."
00:48:15,00:48:18,And there was Burnside Street in Montgomery Park
00:48:18,00:48:20,"next to each other, which is Montgomery Burns."
00:48:20,00:48:23,And then Portland also has Ter Williger Boulevard.
00:48:23,00:48:26,"And of course, the real name of sideshow Bob"
00:48:26,00:48:29,is Robert Underdunk Ter Williger.
00:48:29,00:48:31,But he didn't name him after it.
00:48:31,00:48:33,- No.
00:48:33,00:48:34,- Completely different person.
00:48:34,00:48:37,"They were interviewed once, and they named sideshow Bob"
00:48:37,00:48:40,"after a character from the film, The 5,000 Fingers of Tea,"
00:48:40,00:48:42,who was called Dr. Ter Williger.
00:48:42,00:48:44,And it has nothing to do with the fact
00:48:44,00:48:45,"that also in Portland, Oregon,"
00:48:45,00:48:47,there's a street called Ter Williger Boulevard.
00:48:47,00:48:48,- That's a total coincidence.
00:48:48,00:48:49,- It's apparently so.
00:48:49,00:48:51,- Maggie Simpson is the baby.
00:48:51,00:48:55,Her first word was Daddy.
00:48:55,00:48:59,"And it was said by friend of the podcast, Elizabeth Taylor."
00:48:59,00:48:59,- Oh.
00:48:59,00:49:02,"- They got lots of famous people voicing it, don't they?"
00:49:02,00:49:04,But she had to do six takes.
00:49:04,00:49:07,"Because every time she did it, it came out too sexy."
00:49:07,00:49:10,(all laughing)
00:49:10,00:49:11,"- Oh, God."
00:49:11,00:49:13,"- According to producer Mike Reese,"
00:49:13,00:49:15,he said we had to keep reminding Elizabeth Taylor
00:49:15,00:49:17,"that she was a baby talking to her father,"
00:49:17,00:49:19,not hitting on him.
00:49:19,00:49:20,(all laughing)
00:49:20,00:49:23,- Do you know who voices Maggie?
00:49:23,00:49:26,"So, Maggie is, we just, we get the dummy sucking."
00:49:26,00:49:28,- So you mean who does the dummy sucking?
00:49:28,00:49:28,- Yeah.
00:49:28,00:49:29,- Who does the dummy sucking?
00:49:29,00:49:32,"- Is it also Lisa, Nancy Cartwright?"
00:49:32,00:49:33,- Nancy Cartwright.
00:49:33,00:49:34,"- No, no."
00:49:34,00:49:35,- Is it Matt Groening?
00:49:35,00:49:35,- It's Matt Groening.
00:49:35,00:49:36,- Is it?
00:49:36,00:49:37,- Yeah.
00:49:37,00:49:39,"- It's like it's an easy way to make a lot of money, isn't it?"
00:49:39,00:49:41,- I think it's like when we talked about Simon Cowell
00:49:41,00:49:44,doing the cowbell just to get the credit.
00:49:44,00:49:46,"- It's like, I'm just going to get a credit on this."
00:49:46,00:49:48,- He can't need more.
00:49:48,00:49:50,- It can't be the producer of the show.
00:49:50,00:49:51,It can't be the difference between him.
00:49:51,00:49:53,- 100% he'll get paid for that.
00:49:53,00:49:53,- Yeah.
00:49:53,00:49:54,- That's very funny.
00:49:54,00:49:56,- I'm going to say that's James's opinion
00:49:56,00:49:57,as to why he's doing it.
00:49:57,00:49:59,- I don't believe that's his motivation.
00:49:59,00:50:01,- That's why I coffin these shows sometimes
00:50:01,00:50:03,is to get a little extra on the back end.
00:50:03,00:50:06,- I'd love to start a feud with The Simpsons
00:50:06,00:50:08,and then maybe they'll put us in The Simpsons
00:50:08,00:50:10,"as some evil, I mean, no one watches that anymore."
00:50:10,00:50:13,"So it doesn't really matter, but there you go."
00:50:13,00:50:14,There's your feud.
00:50:14,00:50:15,- Cool.
00:50:15,00:50:16,"- That would be, yeah, yeah."
00:50:16,00:50:18,- They used to get into great beef with people all the time
00:50:18,00:50:19,and they recently have had a bit.
00:50:19,00:50:20,They've had a bit with Morrissey.
00:50:20,00:50:21,- Okay.
00:50:21,00:50:22,- Oh yeah.
00:50:22,00:50:23,- He hates beef.
00:50:23,00:50:25,(laughing)
00:50:27,00:50:28,- They parodied him in an episode called
00:50:28,00:50:30,Panic on the Streets of Springfield.
00:50:30,00:50:33,They had a singer who had a quiff and was a vegan
00:50:33,00:50:35,"and you know, they just took the Mickey a bit."
00:50:35,00:50:37,That was pretty gentle.
00:50:37,00:50:38,"And Morrissey complained,"
00:50:38,00:50:40,"""You are especially despised if your music"
00:50:40,00:50:42,affects people in a strong and beautiful way.
00:50:42,00:50:44,"In fact, the worst thing you can do in 2021"
00:50:44,00:50:46,is lend a bit of strength to the lives of others.
00:50:46,00:50:47,There is no place in modern music
00:50:47,00:50:49,for anyone with strong emotions.
00:50:49,00:50:50,"In a world obsessed with hate laws,"
00:50:50,00:50:52,"there are none that protect me."""
00:50:52,00:50:54,"- Hang on, was this targeted at The Simpsons?"
00:50:54,00:50:55,- Yes!
00:50:55,00:50:57,"- Okay, so the story just sounds like a generic statement."
00:50:57,00:50:58,- It was a statement to The Simpsons.
00:50:58,00:50:59,- It was to Dear Simpsons.
00:50:59,00:51:00,And there he is.
00:51:00,00:51:03,- They've had high profile beef with world leaders.
00:51:03,00:51:06,So they had Barbara Bush called them out saying
00:51:06,00:51:07,that it wasn't a show you should watch
00:51:07,00:51:09,and Marge Simpson wrote a letter
00:51:09,00:51:11,to Barbara Bush in response saying
00:51:11,00:51:14,that she actually thinks her family is a good family.
00:51:14,00:51:15,"They've had episodes where,"
00:51:15,00:51:17,'cause obviously it's a global product.
00:51:17,00:51:18,And so there's a lot of references
00:51:18,00:51:21,that are gonna be not suitable for certain countries.
00:51:21,00:51:23,"So in China, for example, there was one episode"
00:51:23,00:51:26,they had to remove the line about Mao Zedong
00:51:26,00:51:30,being a little angel who killed 50 million people.
00:51:30,00:51:32,They thought that wasn't appropriate in Japan.
00:51:32,00:51:34,- Can you cut after angels too?
00:51:34,00:51:36,(all laughing)
00:51:36,00:51:41,"- Japan, there was an episode where they had to lose a bit"
00:51:41,00:51:42,because--
00:51:42,00:51:44,- They mentioned the massive Japanese bogathon.
00:51:44,00:51:47,(all laughing)
00:51:47,00:51:48,"- Yeah, Hobotoss is the Japanese emperor"
00:51:48,00:51:51,into a sumo thong dumpster.
00:51:51,00:51:53,"So in fact, that whole episode was banned."
00:51:53,00:51:54,- Right.
00:51:54,00:51:58,"- Okay, do you think that Marge should dump Homer?"
00:51:58,00:51:59,- Not after all this time.
00:51:59,00:52:00,I think--
00:52:00,00:52:01,"- Oh, really?"
00:52:01,00:52:03,"- Well, I just think once you've been in a relationship"
00:52:03,00:52:05,"for, when was my marriage?"
00:52:05,00:52:07,"Once you've been in the marriage for at least 12 years,"
00:52:07,00:52:09,you shouldn't dump your husband.
00:52:09,00:52:10,"- I think, yeah."
00:52:10,00:52:12,"I think once the kids are grown up and out of home,"
00:52:12,00:52:14,"unfortunately, that's never happening."
00:52:14,00:52:16,"- Okay, I only ask because you, Gov,"
00:52:16,00:52:19,asked their long suffering test audiences.
00:52:19,00:52:22,"This is 2018, yeah, all right."
00:52:22,00:52:24,- I think 20 people trapped in a room.
00:52:24,00:52:27,(all laughing)
00:52:27,00:52:28,"- What did they say, the prisoners?"
00:52:28,00:52:29,- So thank you for asking.
00:52:29,00:52:34,So 14% of women said Marge should dump Homer.
00:52:34,00:52:35,"Only 8% of men said that,"
00:52:35,00:52:37,so men being a bit more forgiving.
00:52:37,00:52:39,"- Can't believe so few of either, though."
00:52:39,00:52:40,"- Well, you go--"
00:52:40,00:52:41,- He's not a good husband.
00:52:41,00:52:42,- I just want to say what you've said.
00:52:42,00:52:45,"When asked, the majority, 52% of Simpsons fans"
00:52:45,00:52:47,"consider Homer a man who frequently strangles his son,"
00:52:47,00:52:49,"has framed Marge for drink driving,"
00:52:49,00:52:51,"committed bigamy, caused his father's kidneys to fail,"
00:52:51,00:52:53,"has worked for a terrorist organization,"
00:52:53,00:52:55,and is frequently asleep or absent in his role overseeing
00:52:55,00:52:58,safety at a nuclear power plant to be a good person.
00:52:58,00:53:01,"- Has he not also, like, he's definitely been to space."
00:53:01,00:53:03,"You must have, I bet he saved the world"
00:53:03,00:53:04,like three or four times.
00:53:04,00:53:05,"- Yeah, he probably has."
00:53:05,00:53:07,- You're saying you take the rough with this move.
00:53:07,00:53:07,- Yeah.
00:53:07,00:53:09,"- All right, so by contrast,"
00:53:09,00:53:11,"Bart, who's escapades are far more child-like"
00:53:11,00:53:13,"and consequence-like, is almost twice as likely"
00:53:13,00:53:15,"to be seen as a bad person at 22%,"
00:53:15,00:53:18,"yet Maggie, who shot Mr. Burns,"
00:53:18,00:53:20,is only seen as a bad person by 4%.
00:53:20,00:53:21,- 4%.
00:53:21,00:53:21,- Sorry.
00:53:21,00:53:23,- 4%.
00:53:23,00:53:24,"- That was a big deal, wasn't it,"
00:53:24,00:53:26,when it was who shot Mr. Burns?
00:53:26,00:53:28,Were you guys the right age for that?
00:53:28,00:53:29,"- I remember it was, exactly."
00:53:29,00:53:31,"It was like Dallas, yeah, JR."
00:53:31,00:53:33,"- Well, you guys weren't old enough for Dallas."
00:53:33,00:53:34,"- No, no, no, no."
00:53:34,00:53:35,"But yeah, I was there for it."
00:53:35,00:53:36,I remember it.
00:53:36,00:53:39,"Apparently only, they had lots of forums at the time"
00:53:39,00:53:40,"saying, can you guess who it is?"
00:53:40,00:53:45,And the show writers said only one person got that it was--
00:53:45,00:53:47,- I remember you could bet on it.
00:53:47,00:53:49,"And I remember, I don't think even,"
00:53:49,00:53:51,it was one of the options.
00:53:51,00:53:52,- Wow.
00:53:52,00:53:55,- But you weren't old enough to bet at that this time.
00:53:55,00:53:56,But this was going on.
00:53:56,00:53:58,- When did it happen?
00:53:58,00:54:00,- He had a fake ID on 990 at the end of six.
00:54:00,00:54:01,"- I don't know, mid-90s?"
00:54:01,00:54:03,"- Well, I was born in '78."
00:54:03,00:54:03,"- Okay, so it's possible."
00:54:03,00:54:05,"- So I was able to, in '96, I could--"
00:54:05,00:54:07,- I'm just picturing the scene in the betting shop.
00:54:07,00:54:09,"Like, a load of jaded regulars gathered around"
00:54:09,00:54:11,"the horse racing screen and a load of, like,"
00:54:11,00:54:13,nerds in the other corner watching the Simpsons.
00:54:13,00:54:15,(all laughing)
00:54:15,00:54:16,"And it comes in this, Maggie."
00:54:16,00:54:17,Oh!
00:54:17,00:54:18,(all laughing)
00:54:18,00:54:20,Get her out of your ticket.
00:54:20,00:54:22,"One guy goes to the counter, pulls out the stacks"
00:54:22,00:54:23,and stacks of cash.
00:54:23,00:54:25,(all laughing)
00:54:25,00:54:26,- Isn't that Matt Groening?
00:54:26,00:54:27,(all laughing)
