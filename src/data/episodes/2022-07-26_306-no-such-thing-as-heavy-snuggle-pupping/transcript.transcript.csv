00:00:00,00:00:02,"- Hey everybody, welcome to this week's episode of Fish."
00:00:02,00:00:04,We have a very exciting guest on this week.
00:00:04,00:00:05,"- Yes, is it Andy?"
00:00:05,00:00:06,- It's not Andy.
00:00:06,00:00:08,"Yeah, no, Andy is still a guest."
00:00:08,00:00:11,We consider him a guest of the show.
00:00:11,00:00:12,"But no, he was busy this week, so."
00:00:12,00:00:14,- I thought what I was saying is Andy isn't here.
00:00:14,00:00:16,"- Yeah, that's effectively."
00:00:16,00:00:18,"But I still, I feel the guest thing."
00:00:18,00:00:23,"No, very excitingly, we have the founder of QI, John Lloyd himself."
00:00:23,00:00:25,He's been on a few times.
00:00:25,00:00:27,This is the guy who gave us not the nine o'clock news.
00:00:27,00:00:29,"Black Adder, spitting image."
00:00:29,00:00:32,"He helped create Mr. Bean, co-wrote to the original radio episodes"
00:00:32,00:00:34,of Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.
00:00:34,00:00:37,"- Yes, he exact produced a short-lived television show."
00:00:37,00:00:38,Those things are the news.
00:00:38,00:00:40,- Which he says is the highlight of his career.
00:00:40,00:00:41,I don't know if he means the ending of it
00:00:41,00:00:45,"or the experience itself, but he's now turned himself"
00:00:45,00:00:47,into a music manager.
00:00:47,00:00:49,The band that he looks after is called Waiting for Smith.
00:00:49,00:00:52,"And if you hang out, listener, to the end of this episode,"
00:00:52,00:00:54,we're actually gonna play a track
00:00:54,00:00:56,"from Waiting for Smith, their latest singer."
00:00:56,00:00:57,- You don't have to listen to it all.
00:00:57,00:00:59,You can fast forward the whole episode.
00:00:59,00:01:01,- It just gets straight to the song.
00:01:01,00:01:04,"- No, no, experience the show without our guest Andy"
00:01:04,00:01:09,and see how it feels and give us feedback of what you think.
00:01:09,00:01:10,"Anyway, he was a fantastic guest."
00:01:10,00:01:12,It's always amazing to get loydy on the show
00:01:12,00:01:14,and have a listen at the end.
00:01:14,00:01:15,"And yeah, enjoy the show."
00:01:15,00:01:18,(upbeat music)
00:01:19,00:01:22,(upbeat music)
00:01:22,00:01:32,- Hello and welcome to another episode
00:01:32,00:01:35,"of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast"
00:01:35,00:01:38,coming to you from the QI offices in Covert Garden.
00:01:38,00:01:39,My name is Dan Schreiber.
00:01:39,00:01:43,"I am sitting here with James Harkin, Anna Chazinski"
00:01:43,00:01:45,and Chief Nome John Lloyd.
00:01:45,00:01:47,"And once again, we have gathered around the microphones"
00:01:47,00:01:50,with our four favorite facts from the last seven days
00:01:50,00:01:53,"and in no particular order, here we go."
00:01:53,00:01:55,"Starting with you, John."
00:01:55,00:01:59,"- Right, my fact is that when the Greek government"
00:01:59,00:02:03,"put a tax on swimming pools in 2008,"
00:02:03,00:02:07,only 324 Athenians admitted to having one.
00:02:07,00:02:11,"A search by Google Earth Hava revealed the actual number,"
00:02:11,00:02:14,"16,974."
00:02:14,00:02:15,(laughing)
00:02:15,00:02:16,- It's incredible.
00:02:16,00:02:18,"- It's bare face, isn't it?"
00:02:18,00:02:22,"According to the IMF, more than half of all Greek households"
00:02:22,00:02:24,pay no income tax at all.
00:02:24,00:02:25,- Wow.
00:02:25,00:02:27,- And Greece has got the largest black market
00:02:27,00:02:31,"in the whole Eurozone, accounting for 21.5% of its GDP."
00:02:31,00:02:34,"There's a reason for this, I believe."
00:02:34,00:02:37,I was when I was in Greece last year.
00:02:37,00:02:38,"Somebody explained why this is,"
00:02:38,00:02:41,why the Greeks are so poor at playing their taxes.
00:02:41,00:02:42,"Because for a thousand years,"
00:02:42,00:02:44,"they were part of the Ottoman Empire,"
00:02:44,00:02:45,which they absolutely hated.
00:02:45,00:02:48,"And it was considered a patriotic national duty,"
00:02:48,00:02:50,not to pay your taxes.
00:02:50,00:02:51,"- Well, and they just haven't caught up with the history"
00:02:51,00:02:54,that the Ottoman Empire fell apart a hundred years ago.
00:02:54,00:02:56,- I think there are some traditions
00:02:56,00:02:58,that you really want to bring back immediately
00:02:58,00:03:00,and maybe pay in taxes not one of them.
00:03:00,00:03:01,It has a bit lower down on the list.
00:03:01,00:03:02,- You're right.
00:03:02,00:03:03,"- I love these pools,"
00:03:03,00:03:05,'cause it feels as if they were prepared
00:03:05,00:03:07,"for this Google Earth search,"
00:03:07,00:03:09,because they all hide them with camouflage.
00:03:09,00:03:10,- How do you hide a pool?
00:03:10,00:03:13,"- Okay, so they have floating tiles"
00:03:13,00:03:14,that they put on the top of their pool.
00:03:14,00:03:15,- Very clever.
00:03:15,00:03:16,"- Yep, they have army nets,"
00:03:16,00:03:19,so they camouflage it all together.
00:03:19,00:03:22,And some even paint the interior of their pools
00:03:22,00:03:23,to mimic grass.
00:03:23,00:03:24,- Wow.
00:03:24,00:03:24,- Wow.
00:03:24,00:03:25,"- Oh, it's brilliant."
00:03:25,00:03:26,- It's extraordinary.
00:03:26,00:03:27,"- So the first Google Earth search said no swimming pools,"
00:03:27,00:03:29,but an extraordinary number of army nets
00:03:29,00:03:32,in people's garden with no apparent reason.
00:03:32,00:03:34,"- The Greeks have a really good history of paying taxes,"
00:03:34,00:03:35,"'cause in ancient Greek,"
00:03:35,00:03:38,they had a really good system of paying tax.
00:03:38,00:03:40,And that is that the assembly in Athens
00:03:40,00:03:44,would pick the richest people to pay tax.
00:03:44,00:03:46,The top 300 in some cases.
00:03:46,00:03:49,And they would just say you have to pay for this parade
00:03:49,00:03:51,and this battleship and this whatever.
00:03:51,00:03:52,- Really?
00:03:52,00:03:53,- And they all agreed.
00:03:53,00:03:56,"They even competed to spend as much money as possible,"
00:03:56,00:03:58,because it was a real kind of thing
00:03:58,00:04:00,where you would get respect from people and gratitude.
00:04:00,00:04:03,"And if you were one of the people who paid tax,"
00:04:03,00:04:06,it really increased your standing in the community.
00:04:06,00:04:07,And people really liked you for it.
00:04:07,00:04:09,So everyone wanted to pay tax.
00:04:09,00:04:10,- Okay.
00:04:10,00:04:11,- Everyone wanted to be in that 300.
00:04:11,00:04:13,- I wonder if you got your name stamped on the event
00:04:13,00:04:16,"as well, like the liviest parade."
00:04:16,00:04:16,- You did?
00:04:16,00:04:18,"Yeah, did you all you paid the more likely"
00:04:18,00:04:19,you were to get your name on something?
00:04:19,00:04:21,"- So this is kind of like those philanthropists who,"
00:04:21,00:04:24,"I don't know if you mentioned after Notre Dame burned down,"
00:04:24,00:04:26,the philanthropists who really wanted to donate millions
00:04:26,00:04:29,and then it turned out they kind of only wanted to do it
00:04:29,00:04:31,"if the bell was renamed, you know,"
00:04:31,00:04:34,"the ex-person, your name was Bell."
00:04:34,00:04:35,- Trump Bell.
00:04:35,00:04:37,"- Yeah, Ikea, wing of Notre Dame."
00:04:40,00:04:43,"They're not the worst taxpayers in the world, the Greeks, though."
00:04:43,00:04:47,"The Chinese, only 2% of Chinese pay any income tax."
00:04:47,00:04:48,"And in Pakistan, it's 1%."
00:04:48,00:04:51,"I mean, you wonder how these countries operate?"
00:04:51,00:04:55,"- Especially China, which operates entirely as government, yeah."
00:04:55,00:04:58,"I suppose it's just hard to get into those hard to reach spots,"
00:04:58,00:04:58,isn't it?
00:04:58,00:05:00,We've all had that itch on our back.
00:05:00,00:05:02,"It's kind of quite big, guys."
00:05:02,00:05:05,- I was kind of nervous researching this topic
00:05:05,00:05:08,'cause my Google searches were like amazing tax dodges
00:05:08,00:05:11,and we're coming up to the end of the tax year.
00:05:11,00:05:14,But I found tax dodges quite fun the way the people got--
00:05:14,00:05:16,"- Again, researching them, right?"
00:05:16,00:05:17,"- Resurrecting them, just--"
00:05:17,00:05:18,- Ah!
00:05:18,00:05:24,"- That's my accountant there, Jimmy."
00:05:24,00:05:27,"- Yeah, no, early England tax is like the 1700s."
00:05:27,00:05:29,So there's so many great ways that people try to get around
00:05:29,00:05:31,all the taxes that were being thrown at them.
00:05:31,00:05:34,"So there was tax on bricks, for example, in houses."
00:05:34,00:05:37,So one of the dodges that they used to do was people
00:05:37,00:05:39,just used to use bigger bricks.
00:05:39,00:05:40,So you use less brick.
00:05:40,00:05:40,"- Oh, really?"
00:05:40,00:05:41,"- Perhaps, yeah."
00:05:41,00:05:43,"- Yeah, I did, you could just use four bricks, one for each wall."
00:05:43,00:05:46,"- Exactly, and then they call onto that."
00:05:46,00:05:50,So they eventually taxed big bricks as well.
00:05:50,00:05:53,"- Did it, by the way, that's actually a bit like with cheese."
00:05:53,00:05:56,You know the origin of big cheese wheels is based on the fact
00:05:56,00:05:58,that cheese used to be taxed by number of cheeses
00:05:58,00:06:00,"in Switzerland, rather than by weight."
00:06:00,00:06:03,And so people would just make bigger and bigger giant cheeses.
00:06:03,00:06:04,And that's why we have them.
00:06:04,00:06:07,And now the average emmental is three feet diameter
00:06:07,00:06:09,and weighs 220 pounds.
00:06:09,00:06:11,And uses one and a half tons of milk
00:06:11,00:06:12,'cause it just gets the same amount of taxes.
00:06:12,00:06:13,And many one.
00:06:13,00:06:14,- That's a mini baby bell.
00:06:14,00:06:15,- And baby bell?
00:06:15,00:06:16,- Yeah.
00:06:16,00:06:19,"- I was just looking at the quite famous case,"
00:06:19,00:06:21,the jaffa cake case on tax.
00:06:21,00:06:23,"So you know, there's always this debate over where"
00:06:23,00:06:25,"the cake, the cakes or biscuits debate."
00:06:25,00:06:27,And that originates in 1991.
00:06:27,00:06:30,"I think it was, and it's because cakes are traditionally"
00:06:30,00:06:32,in a lot of countries actually are not subject
00:06:32,00:06:35,"to VAT sales tax, whereas biscuits with chocolate on our"
00:06:35,00:06:37,'cause cakes were seen as a necessity
00:06:37,00:06:38,"'cause it used to be, you know,"
00:06:38,00:06:40,your working household would make a cake.
00:06:40,00:06:43,"But yeah, in 1991, McVitties insisted jaffa cake was a cake."
00:06:43,00:06:46,"And so they agreed it had biscuit tendencies,"
00:06:46,00:06:49,but then had to argue overall that it had more cake elements.
00:06:49,00:06:51,"And as part of the, like in court,"
00:06:51,00:06:53,"as part of the evidence for the fact that it was a cake,"
00:06:53,00:06:57,McVitties baked a one foot diameter jaffa cake
00:06:57,00:06:59,to show this is actually a cake.
00:06:59,00:07:00,And the courts can cut.
00:07:00,00:07:02,And it's been a cake ever since.
00:07:02,00:07:03,- That's not cool.
00:07:03,00:07:03,"- Yeah, it's amazing."
00:07:03,00:07:05,- Do you know the difference in cakes and biscuits?
00:07:05,00:07:06,How you tell?
00:07:06,00:07:06,- How you tell?
00:07:06,00:07:09,"- Because when they go stale, biscuits go soft"
00:07:09,00:07:10,and cakes go hard.
00:07:10,00:07:11,- Yeah.
00:07:11,00:07:12,"- Oh, that's cool."
00:07:12,00:07:14,- But they didn't have the time to sit in the court
00:07:14,00:07:18,"for sort of three weeks, watching the jaffa cake go stale."
00:07:18,00:07:20,This is also actually the case with gingerbread men.
00:07:20,00:07:22,So a gingerbread man counts as a cake
00:07:22,00:07:25,and counts as a biscuit that's exempt from tax
00:07:25,00:07:26,'cause it's got no chocolate on it.
00:07:26,00:07:29,Until it has a certain amount of chocolate.
00:07:29,00:07:31,"So if you've got a gingerbread man just with eyes,"
00:07:31,00:07:34,"but naked, no tax on it."
00:07:34,00:07:37,But then it'll cost 20% more if it's got one button.
00:07:37,00:07:38,- No.
00:07:38,00:07:39,(laughing)
00:07:39,00:07:40,- One button on its shirt.
00:07:40,00:07:43,- Who in their right mind is adding that one button?
00:07:43,00:07:44,"- No, I don't know."
00:07:44,00:07:45,These people are missing a trick.
00:07:45,00:07:48,- It's odd that the people who are best at paying taxes
00:07:48,00:07:50,are Americans strangely enough.
00:07:50,00:07:50,- Oh yeah.
00:07:50,00:07:51,- That's slightly surprising.
00:07:51,00:07:55,81 to 84% of Americans don't cheat on their taxes
00:07:55,00:07:58,compared to 68% of Germans and 62% of Italians.
00:07:58,00:07:59,- Are these self-reported figures?
00:07:59,00:08:01,(laughing)
00:08:01,00:08:04,- But it did really shocking actually how much
00:08:04,00:08:08,"tax avoidance goes on, not just Apple and Amazon."
00:08:08,00:08:12,Amazon has not paid any federal taxes in America
00:08:12,00:08:15,even though it makes profits of billions.
00:08:15,00:08:19,And there's $8.7 trillion worth of the world's wealth
00:08:19,00:08:21,hidden away in tax havens by the rich.
00:08:21,00:08:23,That has a lot of money.
00:08:23,00:08:25,- Isn't it something like the fifth biggest country
00:08:25,00:08:28,"in the world if it was a country, isn't it?"
00:08:28,00:08:32,"Something like that, I think, for the biggest in terms of income."
00:08:32,00:08:35,"The tax haven country, whatever we're calling that."
00:08:35,00:08:37,- Where does that sounds great?
00:08:37,00:08:38,(laughing)
00:08:38,00:08:38,We know where it is.
00:08:38,00:08:39,- It's very wealthy.
00:08:39,00:08:40,"It's wherever you want it to be, Dad."
00:08:40,00:08:43,- The UK is king of tax havens.
00:08:43,00:08:45,"I mean, we don't have anyone else in the world."
00:08:45,00:08:46,"- Yeah, exactly."
00:08:46,00:08:47,"We talk about Greece and whoever,"
00:08:47,00:08:50,"but British, the Cayman Islands belongs to Britain,"
00:08:50,00:08:52,the Virgin Islands belongs to Britain.
00:08:52,00:08:53,- Bermuda.
00:08:53,00:08:54,"- Bermuda, yeah."
00:08:54,00:08:55,- I love man.
00:08:55,00:08:55,- Yeah.
00:08:55,00:08:58,- The Virgin Islands goes on on. - The Virgin Islands.
00:08:58,00:08:59,- The Virgin Islands. - The Virgin Islands.
00:08:59,00:09:01,- Did you realise you were taxis then?
00:09:01,00:09:03,"- No, we're a bit like those villages in China."
00:09:03,00:09:05,It's very difficult for the tax ones to get down to Bolton.
00:09:05,00:09:07,"- Tough itch to scratch, Bolton."
00:09:07,00:09:10,"- So one of those honest Americans is Warren Buffett,"
00:09:10,00:09:13,who's been paying income tax since he was 14.
00:09:13,00:09:14,- Wow.
00:09:14,00:09:15,- He had a paper round.
00:09:15,00:09:20,"And in 1944, he paid tax of $7 on an income of $592,"
00:09:20,00:09:24,"which would be equivalent to about 8,000 pounds today."
00:09:24,00:09:26,He had a pretty enterprising 14-year-old.
00:09:26,00:09:28,"- That's a lot of newspapers, isn't it?"
00:09:28,00:09:32,"- Yeah, another guy who paid £7 tax was the"
00:09:32,00:09:34,longest-serving Prime Minister of Pakistan.
00:09:34,00:09:37,"He was a guy called Noah's Sharif,"
00:09:37,00:09:40,who was in office for nine years on three separate occasions.
00:09:40,00:09:43,"At one point, he had a personal fortune of two billion pounds,"
00:09:43,00:09:45,"but over a period of several years,"
00:09:45,00:09:47,paid only just seven pounds into tax.
00:09:47,00:09:48,"- Wow, the same one."
00:09:48,00:09:49,- My wife and he bothers Bermuda.
00:09:49,00:09:51,"It's like, yeah, this is it."
00:09:51,00:09:53,I'm fessing up here.
00:09:53,00:09:54,- It's your full seven-quid bag.
00:09:54,00:09:56,(all laughing)
00:09:56,00:09:58,- Shall we say something to stuff on swimming pools?
00:09:58,00:09:59,"- Yeah, sure."
00:09:59,00:10:00,- Let's do that.
00:10:00,00:10:05,"So, do you know, name something that you're not allowed"
00:10:05,00:10:07,to do with a swimming pool?
00:10:07,00:10:09,- You already have a poo.
00:10:09,00:10:12,"- Oh my, are there any signs on the walls"
00:10:12,00:10:13,to say you can't do that?
00:10:13,00:10:16,"- No, that's true, which is why I always challenge them."
00:10:16,00:10:17,(all laughing)
00:10:17,00:10:18,- On the attempt to kick me out.
00:10:18,00:10:20,"- Okay, Dave, something that's explicitly told you"
00:10:20,00:10:23,"that's allowed to do on the wall, - Oh, petting."
00:10:23,00:10:25,"- Petting, that's why I'm saying that."
00:10:25,00:10:26,- Not allowed?
00:10:26,00:10:27,"- I mean, who uses that word anymore?"
00:10:27,00:10:30,"- Right, so why do they call it heavy petting"
00:10:30,00:10:32,in these swimming pools?
00:10:32,00:10:33,- Yeah.
00:10:33,00:10:35,"- Because surely it's just snogging or kissing or whatever,"
00:10:35,00:10:36,right?
00:10:36,00:10:38,"Well, the reason is, in the 1920s in America,"
00:10:38,00:10:41,"they had some things called petting parties,"
00:10:41,00:10:44,"and high school students would go to swimming pools,"
00:10:44,00:10:46,and they would kind of kiss and cuddle and whatever.
00:10:46,00:10:47,"They would never have sex in there,"
00:10:47,00:10:50,but they would be getting very close.
00:10:50,00:10:53,"And people disapproved, and so they would have signs"
00:10:53,00:10:55,"saying no petting on the swimming pools,"
00:10:55,00:10:59,"and that has kind of kept over for almost 100 years now,"
00:10:59,00:11:00,and you still get heavy petting.
00:11:00,00:11:01,- Really?
00:11:01,00:11:03,- Signs even though you don't have these parties anymore.
00:11:03,00:11:05,- But you might have them if they took the signs away.
00:11:05,00:11:06,"- I'm not saying, yeah."
00:11:06,00:11:08,"- So, is that what a petting zoo is?"
00:11:08,00:11:10,(all laughing)
00:11:10,00:11:12,"- It is, I had a traumatic childhood, actually,"
00:11:12,00:11:14,repeatedly taken to those places.
00:11:14,00:11:15,(all laughing)
00:11:15,00:11:16,- To a heavy petting zoo.
00:11:16,00:11:17,(all laughing)
00:11:17,00:11:19,They were also these petting parties.
00:11:19,00:11:21,"They were also known as necking parties,"
00:11:21,00:11:24,"mushing parties, fussing parties,"
00:11:24,00:11:26,and snuggle-pupping parties.
00:11:26,00:11:27,- Snuggle-pupping.
00:11:27,00:11:28,"- So, I really think it should sell the swimming pool."
00:11:28,00:11:30,No snuggle-puppings.
00:11:30,00:11:31,- No snuggle-puppings.
00:11:31,00:11:32,"- Which they won't be,"
00:11:32,00:11:33,'cause everyone will feel too sick
00:11:33,00:11:35,to pet anyone at the phrase snuggle-pupping.
00:11:35,00:11:39,- Because there are no signs actually saying no urinating.
00:11:39,00:11:40,(all laughing)
00:11:40,00:11:43,Public swimming pools contain up to 20 gallons of urine.
00:11:43,00:11:44,- Down.
00:11:44,00:11:45,- Enough to fill a dustbin.
00:11:45,00:11:47,- And the proportion in hotel jacuzzi
00:11:47,00:11:49,is up to three times worse.
00:11:49,00:11:50,- Wow.
00:11:50,00:11:52,- Why are people doing it more in a jacuzzi?
00:11:52,00:11:54,"- I think it's the bubbles that you want to go, don't they?"
00:11:54,00:11:55,- Do you think?
00:11:55,00:11:56,"- Well, I think someone knows."
00:11:56,00:11:58,(all laughing)
00:11:58,00:12:00,"- That study where they found out there was,"
00:12:00,00:12:02,do you say 20 gallons of urine?
00:12:02,00:12:03,- Yes.
00:12:03,00:12:05,"- It was really clever how they did it,"
00:12:05,00:12:06,because it's quite difficult to work out
00:12:06,00:12:08,"how much urine there is in a swimming pool,"
00:12:08,00:12:10,'cause often the chlorine would change it
00:12:10,00:12:12,into other compounds or whatever.
00:12:12,00:12:13,But they found a compound in urine
00:12:13,00:12:16,that doesn't react with any other chemicals.
00:12:16,00:12:19,And that is called acesulfane potassium.
00:12:19,00:12:22,And it's a sweetener that you get in lots of like diet drinks
00:12:22,00:12:23,- Oh yeah.
00:12:23,00:12:26,"- And if you urinate that into a swimming pool,"
00:12:26,00:12:27,"nothing can get rid of it, so it'll stay there."
00:12:27,00:12:29,And so they could take in the amount of water
00:12:29,00:12:31,"and see how much of that was in,"
00:12:31,00:12:33,and then work out the 20 gallons of urine from that.
00:12:33,00:12:36,"- Hang on, are we all urinating this sweetener?"
00:12:36,00:12:39,- I think they took an average of how much people would.
00:12:39,00:12:41,"It's in a lot of foods, it's not just in soft drinks,"
00:12:41,00:12:42,it's in a lot of stuff.
00:12:42,00:12:46,"And that 20 gallons as well as being a dustbin,"
00:12:46,00:12:51,it's approximately 121 bottles worth of urine in the swimming pool.
00:12:51,00:12:52,- In each swimming pool.
00:12:52,00:12:54,"- And they sell it in Aldi, don't they?"
00:12:54,00:12:56,(laughing)
00:12:56,00:12:57,That's a terrible slam.
00:12:57,00:12:58,"Aldi has a really good wine selection, genuinely."
00:12:58,00:12:59,"- They do, they do, they do."
00:12:59,00:13:00,- I'm sorry.
00:13:00,00:13:01,- They win Aldi Awards.
00:13:01,00:13:03,"- Did you know this thing, another thing they could use,"
00:13:03,00:13:05,"and I think they do in some places,"
00:13:05,00:13:07,"silver has got the curious,"
00:13:07,00:13:09,property of sterilizing water.
00:13:09,00:13:11,So they could use silver instead of chlorine.
00:13:11,00:13:13,"- And only more expensive, though,"
00:13:13,00:13:15,"but you know, only tiny amounts,"
00:13:15,00:13:18,you need only 10 parts per billion.
00:13:18,00:13:18,"- Wow, 10."
00:13:18,00:13:20,- And it's completely safe.
00:13:20,00:13:21,- That's great.
00:13:21,00:13:22,"So in the Olympics, whoever comes second"
00:13:22,00:13:25,could jump in the pool out of the race
00:13:25,00:13:26,and then clean the pool for the next race.
00:13:26,00:13:27,- Yes.
00:13:27,00:13:29,(laughing)
00:13:29,00:13:30,- That's really good.
00:13:30,00:13:32,"- You know, when you smell that really strong smell"
00:13:32,00:13:33,of chlorine in a pool.
00:13:33,00:13:34,"- Yeah, I like it actually."
00:13:34,00:13:37,"- And you think, okay, and you get high off it maybe,"
00:13:37,00:13:39,or you think there's too much chlorine in this pool.
00:13:39,00:13:41,Do you know what the problem actually is?
00:13:41,00:13:44,- My nose is too sad to serve.
00:13:44,00:13:44,(laughing)
00:13:44,00:13:46,"- No, it's that there's not enough chlorine."
00:13:46,00:13:47,"- Oh, yeah."
00:13:47,00:13:48,"- So this is, I actually learned this from Dr. Colbert,"
00:13:48,00:13:49,"this in one of his books,"
00:13:49,00:13:52,"but if it smells too strongly of chlorine,"
00:13:52,00:13:53,"it means they haven't put enough in,"
00:13:53,00:13:54,"'cause the smell that you're smelling,"
00:13:54,00:13:58,it's actually when the chlorine reacts with the nitrogen
00:13:58,00:13:59,from things like urine and sweat
00:13:59,00:14:01,and dead insects and bacteria and stuff.
00:14:01,00:14:02,"It combines with it,"
00:14:02,00:14:05,and it makes these chemicals called chloramines.
00:14:05,00:14:07,And the smell comes from this particular chemical
00:14:07,00:14:09,called tri-chloramine.
00:14:09,00:14:10,"So that's very volatile, so you start smelling it."
00:14:10,00:14:12,"If you add more chlorine,"
00:14:12,00:14:13,"then it keeps reacting,"
00:14:13,00:14:14,and it moves on through the chemical process
00:14:14,00:14:16,and the tri-chloramine goes away.
00:14:16,00:14:17,- That's incredible.
00:14:17,00:14:17,- That's amazing.
00:14:17,00:14:18,- The smell that I really like
00:14:18,00:14:20,is actually dead insects and urine.
00:14:20,00:14:22,"- That's correct, yes."
00:14:22,00:14:23,"That seems true to form, no?"
00:14:23,00:14:26,(laughing)
00:14:26,00:14:27,- Did you know that Clint Eastwood
00:14:27,00:14:29,used to dig swimming pools for a living?
00:14:29,00:14:30,- I think that was easy.
00:14:30,00:14:32,- Or was he a very enthusiastic grave digger?
00:14:32,00:14:34,(laughing)
00:14:34,00:14:35,"He was quite successful, quite young,"
00:14:35,00:14:37,and he was sacked by Universal Studios
00:14:37,00:14:39,because his Adam's apple was too big.
00:14:39,00:14:40,- What?
00:14:40,00:14:41,- What are you talking about?
00:14:41,00:14:42,- What do you mean?
00:14:42,00:14:43,(laughing)
00:14:43,00:14:44,"- You're testing this now, aren't you?"
00:14:44,00:14:45,That can't be true.
00:14:45,00:14:47,"- Well, it is true."
00:14:47,00:14:51,It was on IMDB and on www.clinyswood.net.
00:14:51,00:14:52,"- Oh, there you go."
00:14:52,00:14:55,- Where I also found the fact that his name is an anagram
00:14:55,00:14:56,of Old West Action.
00:14:56,00:14:57,That's quite good.
00:14:57,00:14:58,- That's really good.
00:14:58,00:15:00,- Wow.
00:15:00,00:15:02,"Actually, I'm now thinking of Clint Eastwood,"
00:15:02,00:15:04,and he has big Adam's apple.
00:15:04,00:15:05,- You can picture it.
00:15:05,00:15:07,- Big enough to stop him from digging holes.
00:15:07,00:15:09,"- No, he wasn't sacked from the grave digging."
00:15:09,00:15:11,"- I don't know, he was sacked from the movies."
00:15:11,00:15:12,"- Oh, right."
00:15:12,00:15:14,- And then he had to get another job.
00:15:14,00:15:16,- You're gonna scare the mourners.
00:15:16,00:15:18,"- It was swimming pools, it wasn't graves."
00:15:18,00:15:19,- He was so working.
00:15:19,00:15:21,- When did the Adam's apple thing come in?
00:15:21,00:15:21,"- I'm sorry, I've lost it."
00:15:21,00:15:22,- In the '50s.
00:15:22,00:15:24,He was fired by Universal.
00:15:24,00:15:26,- That was at the start of his career all the time.
00:15:26,00:15:29,"- Yeah, he'd been in a couple of sort of B movies,"
00:15:29,00:15:32,"and then the Adam's apple, they suddenly noticed,"
00:15:32,00:15:34,"""Hey, that guy there."""
00:15:34,00:15:37,"Oh my God, it was horrible."
00:15:37,00:15:39,"- It was when they started having 3D movies, didn't it,"
00:15:39,00:15:41,and people thought it was going to pop up in the eye.
00:15:41,00:15:43,(laughing)
00:15:43,00:15:46,(upbeat music)
00:15:46,00:15:50,"- Okay, it's time for fact number two,"
00:15:50,00:15:52,and that is Chazinski.
00:15:52,00:15:55,- My fact this week is that some terraces had heads
00:15:55,00:15:58,that were more than four times the length of their bodies.
00:15:58,00:15:59,- No.
00:15:59,00:16:01,- How big was that Adam's apple?
00:16:01,00:16:03,(laughing)
00:16:03,00:16:05,- They were such stupid looking creatures.
00:16:05,00:16:09,"- So the terraces were tarot dactyl,"
00:16:09,00:16:12,"as often used as kind of a word for the tarot dactyl,"
00:16:12,00:16:13,"tarot dactyl actually not a thing,"
00:16:13,00:16:16,the tarot dactyl lus was a type of tarot saw.
00:16:16,00:16:20,"But yeah, they were the first flying species,"
00:16:20,00:16:23,and they started off about 250 million years ago
00:16:23,00:16:24,"with heads nearly as long as their bodies,"
00:16:24,00:16:26,and they just extended and extended
00:16:26,00:16:30,"until you got some terraces like the Ketsal coactless,"
00:16:30,00:16:33,where the heads and the necks were at least triple
00:16:33,00:16:37,"the length of the torso, so it took up over 75% of their bodies."
00:16:37,00:16:39,"- It feels like if you're a flying animal,"
00:16:39,00:16:41,having a massive head that's three times
00:16:41,00:16:43,big with everything else is probably going to be a problem.
00:16:43,00:16:45,- You just tip them out the sky all the time.
00:16:45,00:16:46,"- You think so, right?"
00:16:46,00:16:48,"- It's been this real mystery about how they figured it out,"
00:16:48,00:16:52,"re-center of gravity, and generally their massive size."
00:16:52,00:16:53,And one of the ways that they did it
00:16:53,00:16:55,was by having a very light head.
00:16:55,00:16:57,So they had these openings in front of their eyes
00:16:57,00:16:59,"in their skulls called the antorbital fenestra,"
00:16:59,00:17:01,which is just the window in front of their eyes.
00:17:01,00:17:03,"And we don't really know what was in it,"
00:17:03,00:17:06,"maybe a gland or muscle, it might've just been a big air cavity."
00:17:06,00:17:09,"And this sometimes has huge hole in their skull,"
00:17:09,00:17:10,"was so big that it could, in some of them,"
00:17:10,00:17:13,it could fit their entire torso through it.
00:17:13,00:17:14,Isn't they didn't put their torso through it?
00:17:14,00:17:16,"- If they stopped too fast,"
00:17:16,00:17:17,wouldn't it shoot out through it?
00:17:17,00:17:18,"- Yes, exactly."
00:17:18,00:17:19,They literally turn inside out.
00:17:19,00:17:23,"- Like a jumpy, you have to put back the right way around."
00:17:23,00:17:24,"- Yeah, it's amazing."
00:17:24,00:17:27,And also one reason that we know they had very light heads
00:17:27,00:17:29,"is because the bones were very light, right?"
00:17:29,00:17:30,- Yes.
00:17:30,00:17:32,"- But the bones were quite thick in places,"
00:17:32,00:17:35,"but there was a big gap of air in the middle,"
00:17:35,00:17:39,and then the actual edges of the bone were like one millimeter thick.
00:17:39,00:17:40,And that means it's really hard for us to find
00:17:40,00:17:44,terrasaur fossils because they just kind of wash away
00:17:44,00:17:46,on the crumbalop.
00:17:46,00:17:48,There's hardly any of them in existence.
00:17:48,00:17:51,"I read one article, I don't know if this is true"
00:17:51,00:17:54,"of all terrasars, but one person said"
00:17:54,00:17:56,you could put all the fossil material of terrasars
00:17:56,00:17:58,that we've ever found in one handbag.
00:17:58,00:17:59,- No.
00:17:59,00:18:01,- If you were to crush it all up.
00:18:01,00:18:03,"And that's because it's so thin,"
00:18:03,00:18:06,"and so we all had a nice, not that many of them as well."
00:18:06,00:18:09,It could be that they were talking about specific species
00:18:09,00:18:10,I couldn't quite tell from there.
00:18:10,00:18:11,- You could believe that though.
00:18:11,00:18:12,"If you powder ill, put it in a blender."
00:18:12,00:18:14,- I've seen some big handbags.
00:18:14,00:18:16,- That's why they check your handbags
00:18:16,00:18:18,at the Natural History Museum when you're at it.
00:18:18,00:18:19,- That's why.
00:18:19,00:18:20,"- Because it's a terrasaur, isn't it?"
00:18:20,00:18:21,"- Yeah, it's because we're serras."
00:18:21,00:18:23,This all of the fossils of terrasars
00:18:23,00:18:25,we've never found in history in the uphand bag.
00:18:25,00:18:26,"- Oh, busted."
00:18:27,00:18:29,"- Terrasars, not dinosaurs."
00:18:29,00:18:30,- No.
00:18:30,00:18:31,"- I'm sure everyone around this table knew that,"
00:18:31,00:18:32,"but I didn't, so it's worth saying."
00:18:32,00:18:33,- It's weird.
00:18:33,00:18:34,- For the people at home.
00:18:34,00:18:35,"Yeah, not dinosaurs."
00:18:35,00:18:37,"- And also, birds didn't descend from them."
00:18:37,00:18:39,"Which, again, I think everyone says,"
00:18:39,00:18:40,birds descend from dinosaurs.
00:18:40,00:18:42,"And you think, why it must be the flying type,"
00:18:42,00:18:45,"but yeah, not at all birds descended from things"
00:18:45,00:18:48,that could not fly when the dinosaurs were around.
00:18:48,00:18:49,"- It's really amazing that, isn't it?"
00:18:49,00:18:52,And I read as well that the largest thing
00:18:52,00:18:56,"which survived that attack from a meteorite,"
00:18:56,00:18:57,"not an attack, it wasn't a meteorite spot."
00:18:57,00:18:59,"- It wasn't malicious, you make it sound deliberate."
00:18:59,00:19:01,- It was just flying through the universe
00:19:01,00:19:02,and the earth got in the way.
00:19:02,00:19:03,- Yeah.
00:19:03,00:19:04,- It's not the meteorite spot.
00:19:04,00:19:06,But the largest thing that would have survived
00:19:06,00:19:08,was around 44 pounds.
00:19:08,00:19:11,And that today would be about the size of an American beaver.
00:19:11,00:19:13,So anything bigger than a beaver would die.
00:19:13,00:19:15,"Anything smaller than a beaver,"
00:19:15,00:19:17,"some would die, but some would survive."
00:19:17,00:19:19,And the things that turn into birds
00:19:19,00:19:23,were not just the small dinosaurs weirdly.
00:19:23,00:19:26,It was some of the medium ones that were eating seeds.
00:19:26,00:19:27,- Okay.
00:19:27,00:19:29,- Because when there's like a nuclear winter
00:19:29,00:19:32,"because the meteor hits and nothing can grow,"
00:19:32,00:19:34,the seeds can still live underground.
00:19:34,00:19:37,And so these little dinosaurs could go and still eat the seeds
00:19:37,00:19:38,until everything got better.
00:19:38,00:19:40,And they were the ones that survived.
00:19:40,00:19:41,- Wow.
00:19:41,00:19:42,"- And I wonder if that's, I think that's why today"
00:19:42,00:19:45,"like birds, which are the things that survived"
00:19:45,00:19:46,from there are the things that eat seeds.
00:19:46,00:19:49,"- Okay, yeah, that's really cool."
00:19:49,00:19:54,One thing that's descended from those guys are woodpeckers.
00:19:54,00:19:55,"- Oh, yeah."
00:19:55,00:19:57,"- And those just found them, but what they do with their heads,"
00:19:57,00:20:00,they bang their heads into trees at speeds of about 15 miles
00:20:00,00:20:03,"an hour up to 12,000 times a day."
00:20:03,00:20:04,- Whoa.
00:20:04,00:20:06,"- I mean, what must that be like?"
00:20:06,00:20:06,- Yeah.
00:20:06,00:20:08,"- I don't think they get headaches, it's just."
00:20:08,00:20:10,- We found this out for QI ones and it's...
00:20:10,00:20:13,"- I never got a weird tongue, haven't they?"
00:20:13,00:20:14,- Yeah.
00:20:14,00:20:15,- They're wrapped around their brains.
00:20:15,00:20:16,- Yeah.
00:20:16,00:20:16,- Yeah.
00:20:16,00:20:19,- I think they got thick skulls or some kind of padding skulls.
00:20:19,00:20:21,- They've got some kind of special brain casing.
00:20:21,00:20:22,- Yeah.
00:20:22,00:20:24,- It's sort of wobbles around in jelly.
00:20:24,00:20:25,"- It is amazing though, isn't it?"
00:20:25,00:20:27,"- Another head banger is death watch beetles,"
00:20:27,00:20:29,which repeatedly bang their heads on the floor
00:20:29,00:20:31,to attract mates.
00:20:31,00:20:31,- It's incredible.
00:20:31,00:20:33,"- I tried that, doesn't it?"
00:20:33,00:20:33,- Don't work.
00:20:33,00:20:35,"- No, no."
00:20:35,00:20:37,"- Death watch beetles, that's a metal band."
00:20:37,00:20:38,- Death watch beetles.
00:20:38,00:20:40,- Death watch beetles and a metal tribute beetles bag.
00:20:40,00:20:41,(laughing)
00:20:41,00:20:46,"- I've got some, I decided to run a search for four times"
00:20:46,00:20:48,to what things are four times as much as you do.
00:20:48,00:20:49,- Oh yeah.
00:20:49,00:20:50,"- Oh yeah, yeah."
00:20:50,00:20:51,- So there's some quite good ones in here.
00:20:51,00:20:54,"So spiders milk, but you didn't know there wasn't it,"
00:20:54,00:20:56,but some spiders produce milk.
00:20:56,00:20:59,And spiders milk contains four times as much protein
00:20:59,00:21:00,as cow's milk.
00:21:00,00:21:01,"- Oh, one more."
00:21:01,00:21:03,"- And they're hard to milk though, aren't they?"
00:21:03,00:21:06,I reckon like you get more from a cow's other
00:21:06,00:21:08,than you do from a spider's other.
00:21:08,00:21:09,- Just going to milk the spiders?
00:21:09,00:21:13,"I'll be back in two months, when I've got enough."
00:21:13,00:21:17,"- So, and chimpanzees expend four times as much energy"
00:21:17,00:21:21,walking on either four or two legs than humans do.
00:21:21,00:21:22,- Wow.
00:21:22,00:21:23,- It's really hard for them walking.
00:21:23,00:21:24,"- Wow, I wonder why that is."
00:21:24,00:21:25,"- It's awesome, I don't know."
00:21:25,00:21:26,"- They've got a huge upper bodies, haven't they?"
00:21:26,00:21:28,That must be tiring.
00:21:28,00:21:28,- Yeah.
00:21:28,00:21:32,- The T genome is four times longer than the coffee genome.
00:21:32,00:21:34,So that's discovered by Chinese geneticists.
00:21:34,00:21:36,And this one is astonishing.
00:21:36,00:21:39,Almost four times as many people are murdered
00:21:39,00:21:40,as are killed in wars.
00:21:40,00:21:42,Isn't that a shock?
00:21:42,00:21:43,"- Yeah, wow."
00:21:43,00:21:44,- Yeah.
00:21:44,00:21:46,"- I mean, some of us would say that been killed"
00:21:46,00:21:47,in a war is murder.
00:21:47,00:21:50,"- All right, Jeremy Corbyn, okay."
00:21:50,00:21:52,(all laughing)
00:21:52,00:21:52,I'm gonna out.
00:21:52,00:21:54,(all laughing)
00:21:54,00:21:55,"- Well, we've had a lot of guests today,"
00:21:55,00:21:57,"Jimmy Carter, Jeremy Corbyn."
00:21:57,00:21:59,(all laughing)
00:21:59,00:22:00,"- Actually, on tarot actials,"
00:22:00,00:22:02,"they wore a bit hairy, some of them."
00:22:02,00:22:05,"They had what is called tarot fuzz in,"
00:22:05,00:22:08,I found in an email thread that I sort of found
00:22:08,00:22:11,archive between paleontologists.
00:22:11,00:22:13,"But yeah, they found hair fibers on some of them."
00:22:13,00:22:15,And they also think this might be
00:22:15,00:22:17,what helped them be able to fly to do with insulation.
00:22:17,00:22:19,But there was sort of fuzzy or fluffy.
00:22:19,00:22:20,- That's really cool.
00:22:20,00:22:21,- That's cool.
00:22:21,00:22:21,- It's quite cute.
00:22:21,00:22:23,"But not on the wings, I think, just on the bod."
00:22:23,00:22:24,- Just that.
00:22:24,00:22:27,"- Fuzzy bod, bat wings."
00:22:27,00:22:29,- They were also the babies.
00:22:29,00:22:30,You know what they call the baby tarot actal?
00:22:30,00:22:31,Or tarot sore?
00:22:31,00:22:32,"- Um, no."
00:22:32,00:22:33,- Flap wings.
00:22:33,00:22:34,"- Oh, yeah."
00:22:34,00:22:36,"- Flap wings, nice little word."
00:22:36,00:22:37,"And they were, so they were first identified"
00:22:37,00:22:39,by a guy called George's Curvier.
00:22:39,00:22:40,- George Curvier?
00:22:40,00:22:41,- George.
00:22:41,00:22:43,- George.
00:22:43,00:22:45,- George Curvier.
00:22:45,00:22:47,- What stage reading that census did you realize
00:22:47,00:22:48,you were at George?
00:22:48,00:22:49,- You didn't even call him Gub.
00:22:49,00:22:52,(laughing)
00:22:52,00:22:53,- So.
00:22:53,00:22:54,"- Sorry, who was George Curvier then?"
00:22:54,00:22:59,"- George's Curvier was a, he was a scientist."
00:22:59,00:23:02,"And he was the person who discovered,"
00:23:02,00:23:07,or firstly identified the flying terrasaur in 1809.
00:23:07,00:23:10,"And he said that in 1812, he said"
00:23:10,00:23:12,"that they were unlikely, we as humans,"
00:23:12,00:23:16,were ever unlikely to find any animal as large as that.
00:23:16,00:23:19,"Then 10 years after he died, we discovered dinosaurs."
00:23:19,00:23:22,(laughing)
00:23:22,00:23:23,"- Oh, what a shame."
00:23:23,00:23:25,He was the first person to say that they flew.
00:23:25,00:23:28,But the first person to describe them in any way scientifically
00:23:28,00:23:30,was Cosimo Collini.
00:23:30,00:23:33,And he was most famous for being Voltaire's secretary.
00:23:33,00:23:34,- Yeah.
00:23:34,00:23:34,- So it was.
00:23:34,00:23:35,"- It was not cool, isn't it?"
00:23:35,00:23:37,Such a weird two worlds colliding.
00:23:37,00:23:38,- Yeah.
00:23:38,00:23:38,- Yeah.
00:23:38,00:23:40,"- I wonder where he was secretary,"
00:23:40,00:23:44,"because Voltaire, just down the road from us in Comic Garden,"
00:23:44,00:23:45,he used to live there.
00:23:45,00:23:46,"- Oh, Voltaire."
00:23:46,00:23:47,- Yeah.
00:23:47,00:23:48,- I think probably in front of life.
00:23:48,00:23:49,- That's why he lived most of his life.
00:23:49,00:23:50,"- Okay, cool."
00:23:50,00:23:53,"- I think, you said 1809, I think it was 1801, wasn't it?"
00:23:53,00:23:54,- Yeah.
00:23:54,00:23:55,- And it's Curvier.
00:23:55,00:23:57,(laughing)
00:23:57,00:23:59,"- He was also, I mean, not only did he see the baby,"
00:23:59,00:24:01,he was also the person who was the foundation
00:24:01,00:24:03,of all Darwin's theories.
00:24:03,00:24:04,He was the person who realized
00:24:04,00:24:07,that animals could become extinct.
00:24:07,00:24:08,"- I've one last thing before we move on,"
00:24:08,00:24:10,"which is, did you know that there were terraces"
00:24:10,00:24:12,"in the movie ""Citizen Kane""?"
00:24:12,00:24:13,(laughing)
00:24:13,00:24:14,- What?
00:24:14,00:24:15,- So this is really worth checking out.
00:24:15,00:24:16,"So obviously ""Citizen Kane"" held up"
00:24:16,00:24:19,"as one of the greatest movies ever made, Orson Wells."
00:24:19,00:24:22,"He had an incredible script, he had an incredible cast,"
00:24:22,00:24:25,"what he didn't have, was an incredible budget."
00:24:25,00:24:27,"So for a lot of the movie, they had to reuse"
00:24:27,00:24:28,certain things from other movies.
00:24:28,00:24:30,"And there's a scene in the movie, and I've watched it,"
00:24:30,00:24:33,where they're at some sort of party that's on a beach.
00:24:33,00:24:35,And in the background to show a sort of
00:24:35,00:24:40,"jungly background, they had to borrow footage from King Kong,"
00:24:40,00:24:43,"or son of King Kong, because they couldn't afford"
00:24:43,00:24:44,to do it themselves. - Oh my god.
00:24:44,00:24:45,- Yeah.
00:24:45,00:24:48,"So in the background, you see these giant terraces"
00:24:48,00:24:49,"from the movie. - No way, no way."
00:24:49,00:24:52,"- It's a spoiler alert, that's what Rosebud is."
00:24:52,00:24:53,- Yeah.
00:24:53,00:24:54,"- The name of his pet, ""Terrosa""."
00:24:54,00:24:55,(laughing)
00:24:55,00:24:58,(upbeat music)
00:24:58,00:25:02,"- Okay, it's time for fact number three,"
00:25:02,00:25:04,and that is James.
00:25:04,00:25:07,"Okay, my fact this week is that the world's first casino"
00:25:07,00:25:10,had a rule that you could only gamble
00:25:10,00:25:12,if you were wearing a tricon hat.
00:25:12,00:25:14,(laughing)
00:25:14,00:25:17,"So, this was in Venice."
00:25:17,00:25:22,"It was in 1638, and it was called Il Riddotto,"
00:25:22,00:25:24,which means the private room.
00:25:24,00:25:26,And Riddotto was actually a word which was used for
00:25:26,00:25:29,"like illegal gambling clubs at the time,"
00:25:29,00:25:30,"but they closed them all down,"
00:25:30,00:25:32,"and everyone was very upset about it,"
00:25:32,00:25:33,"but they said, ""No, don't worry,"
00:25:33,00:25:36,"""we're gonna make an official one that you can all go to."""
00:25:36,00:25:38,"So, by the rules, everyone's allowed to go there,"
00:25:38,00:25:40,"you're all allowed to gamble here, don't worry,"
00:25:40,00:25:42,"you'll all be able to still gamble,"
00:25:42,00:25:43,"but if you do want to gamble,"
00:25:43,00:25:46,"you're gonna have to wear a tricon hat and a mask,"
00:25:46,00:25:49,"and tricon hats a mask, or it's extremely expensive,"
00:25:49,00:25:51,and so actually the poor people couldn't do it anymore.
00:25:51,00:25:53,- So these were the kind of mask raid masks
00:25:53,00:25:54,"that you would go and they-- - Yes, exactly."
00:25:54,00:25:57,"- Really sorts out your poker face problem, doesn't it,"
00:25:57,00:25:58,when you're gambling.
00:25:58,00:25:59,"- It's pretty good, it's fine. - It's pretty good mask on."
00:25:59,00:26:01,How could they have called anything?
00:26:01,00:26:03,"- I guess usually they don't cover the lips, do they?"
00:26:03,00:26:07,They're sort of-- - So if your tail is a big pal.
00:26:07,00:26:08,"- No, if your tail is a big pal."
00:26:08,00:26:10,"- Because they normally do say,"
00:26:10,00:26:11,but your tail isn't your eyes.
00:26:11,00:26:12,- Not like-- - Do they?
00:26:12,00:26:14,"- Yeah, not pulling faces with your arm."
00:26:14,00:26:16,"- But the masks, you can see out of the mask,"
00:26:16,00:26:18,you can still see people's eyes.
00:26:18,00:26:19,"- Yeah, you can see, well yeah,"
00:26:19,00:26:20,I didn't know the eyes were the tail.
00:26:20,00:26:21,I've been looking in the wrong bit.
00:26:21,00:26:23,"- Love you, look at that, the nose."
00:26:23,00:26:25,"There's no one's how to move, it's still there."
00:26:25,00:26:28,"- Talking about the casinos in Italy,"
00:26:28,00:26:32,"in 1963, Sean Connery, I just couldn't believe this fact,"
00:26:32,00:26:34,but it's there.
00:26:34,00:26:38,He's successfully backed the number 17 three times running
00:26:38,00:26:40,at the St. Vincent Casino in Italy.
00:26:40,00:26:42,"- Yeah, you heard that, sorry?"
00:26:42,00:26:43,"- Matt, yeah. - I have heard the story."
00:26:43,00:26:46,"I know that to be true in a way,"
00:26:46,00:26:50,but it did happen to be that there was a lot of press there.
00:26:50,00:26:51,It was basically a publicity something like that.
00:26:51,00:26:54,"- No, you think it was a publicity stunt,"
00:26:54,00:26:56,but I like to believe it. - I think it was.
00:26:56,00:26:58,"- Yeah. - Although he did, he put it on 17 twice"
00:26:58,00:27:00,"beforehand and it didn't work, didn't he?"
00:27:00,00:27:01,"It still seemed like he was like,"
00:27:01,00:27:02,"""Oh, something's going wrong."""
00:27:02,00:27:04,"- Oh, no."
00:27:04,00:27:05,"- But yeah, basically most people these days"
00:27:05,00:27:07,"think it was a publicity stunt,"
00:27:07,00:27:10,because it happened to be the week before his movie came out
00:27:10,00:27:13,and he was with all the press and everything like that.
00:27:13,00:27:15,"- I saw a bit of footage the other day,"
00:27:15,00:27:18,"totally unrelated to it, but to this fact,"
00:27:18,00:27:20,so it just happened to be watching it.
00:27:20,00:27:22,"I'm convinced it must be a publicity stunt,"
00:27:22,00:27:24,but I can't see anyone that says it was.
00:27:24,00:27:27,"- Muhammad Ali, when he was up against Sunny Liston,"
00:27:27,00:27:30,he turned to get the fight and to really get at him.
00:27:30,00:27:32,He kept showing up at his house in a bus
00:27:32,00:27:35,"and yelling through a megaphone at three o'clock in the morning,"
00:27:35,00:27:37,getting a method that has just infuriating him.
00:27:37,00:27:39,And there's footage of Sunny Liston at a table
00:27:39,00:27:41,in a casino rolling dice.
00:27:41,00:27:43,"And Muhammad Ali beside him, just yelling at him,"
00:27:43,00:27:46,I'm gonna take you down doing all this Ali stuff.
00:27:46,00:27:49,"And just out of nowhere, Sunny Liston pulls a gun"
00:27:49,00:27:52,out of his pocket and he fires it at Muhammad Ali.
00:27:52,00:27:53,And you see footage of Ali running out
00:27:53,00:27:55,and everyone freaking out.
00:27:55,00:27:57,And it turns out that the gun only has blanks in it
00:27:57,00:28:00,and he fires a couple of shots into his jacket
00:28:00,00:28:02,and then just goes back to rolling dice.
00:28:02,00:28:03,And everyone's fine with it.
00:28:03,00:28:04,And it moves on.
00:28:04,00:28:05,He must have crapped himself.
00:28:05,00:28:08,(laughing)
00:28:08,00:28:12,- Found this great line from Stephen Wright about gambling.
00:28:12,00:28:15,"In Vegas, I got into a long argument"
00:28:15,00:28:16,with the man at the roulette wheel
00:28:16,00:28:19,over what I considered to be an odd number.
00:28:19,00:28:22,(laughing)
00:28:22,00:28:23,"- Do you know that all, you know this,"
00:28:23,00:28:25,you all know the fact that all the numbers
00:28:25,00:28:27,on a roulette wheel added up together.
00:28:27,00:28:28,- No.
00:28:28,00:28:29,"- They add up to 666, do you know that?"
00:28:29,00:28:30,"- Yeah, it's a bad sign."
00:28:30,00:28:32,People should know not to enter casinos.
00:28:32,00:28:33,(laughing)
00:28:33,00:28:36,But I actually did some research on roulette
00:28:36,00:28:39,"for this series, the R series."
00:28:39,00:28:41,"And I was reading into the number zero, quite heavily."
00:28:41,00:28:44,And did you know that zero was banned on roulette tables
00:28:44,00:28:45,in this country?
00:28:45,00:28:48,"In the, I think it was the late '60s?"
00:28:48,00:28:49,- Fairly.
00:28:49,00:28:50,"- Yeah, so."
00:28:50,00:28:53,This way is the odds too much in favor of the casino?
00:28:53,00:28:55,"- Well, it's way the odds in favor of the casino at all,"
00:28:55,00:28:56,basically.
00:28:56,00:28:57,"So, like you'll know, if you go to a casino today,"
00:28:57,00:29:00,they all have a zero and they absolutely have to.
00:29:00,00:29:02,"Otherwise, a casino wouldn't be able to come off"
00:29:02,00:29:04,making money because there are 36 numbers.
00:29:04,00:29:06,And you're given odds of one in 36.
00:29:06,00:29:08,But there's this zero on.
00:29:08,00:29:10,Sometimes there's a double zero or triple zero
00:29:10,00:29:11,if you're really being ripped off.
00:29:11,00:29:14,"But yeah, in the '60s, in 1967,"
00:29:14,00:29:16,"the law laws, like the equivalent of the Supreme Court,"
00:29:16,00:29:18,decided that they didn't approve of this.
00:29:18,00:29:21,They thought it was unfair that the casino would have any advantage
00:29:21,00:29:24,and they banned zeros from roulette tables.
00:29:24,00:29:24,- Wow.
00:29:24,00:29:27,"- And Scotland, your policeman would go round casinos"
00:29:27,00:29:29,and like check for zeros on tables
00:29:29,00:29:31,and then close them down if they had them.
00:29:31,00:29:32,- And how long did that last for?
00:29:32,00:29:33,- It lasted a year.
00:29:33,00:29:35,"And then they realized that all casinos were saying,"
00:29:35,00:29:37,"well, we're not going to do business anymore."
00:29:37,00:29:38,And people like casinos.
00:29:38,00:29:39,- It's so interesting.
00:29:39,00:29:41,- And so they changed that law.
00:29:41,00:29:42,- Amazing.
00:29:42,00:29:45,I was reading a thing that apparently something
00:29:45,00:29:47,that's experienced by quite a few casino goers
00:29:47,00:29:49,"if they sit down as a slot machine,"
00:29:49,00:29:53,they'll sometimes sit on quite a damp chair.
00:29:53,00:29:56,"And that's because very, very dedicated gamblers"
00:29:56,00:29:58,who've been playing on a single slot machine for ages
00:29:58,00:29:59,"and know that if they leave,"
00:29:59,00:30:01,it might be the next one that wins.
00:30:01,00:30:03,"Don't go to the toilet, they're just going their trousers."
00:30:03,00:30:04,It's a big thing.
00:30:04,00:30:08,Sort of urinated urine-covered seats.
00:30:08,00:30:09,There's a big problem in casinos.
00:30:09,00:30:10,- Is it really?
00:30:10,00:30:11,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:30:11,00:30:12,It's certainly--
00:30:12,00:30:13,"- Well, a big problem."
00:30:13,00:30:15,"- Well, I never noticed it when I've been to casinos."
00:30:15,00:30:17,"I must say, but I can believe that."
00:30:17,00:30:19,I think they were like adult diapers.
00:30:19,00:30:21,"- Well, this is, yeah, there's new products"
00:30:21,00:30:24,that have been made specifically for a casino goers.
00:30:24,00:30:28,"It's called ""Player's Advantage"" and the idea is,"
00:30:28,00:30:30,it's a diaper that gets you an additional 10 to 12 hours
00:30:30,00:30:32,of continuous play.
00:30:32,00:30:35,"So you can put, you know."
00:30:35,00:30:37,"- Well, you've got to take a long, hard look at your life"
00:30:37,00:30:40,and then when you're buying.
00:30:40,00:30:42,And there's advantage or whatever.
00:30:43,00:30:45,"- The roulette wheel, we don't really know who properly"
00:30:45,00:30:47,"invented the modern one, but a lot of people"
00:30:47,00:30:50,"think it was Blaze Pascale, who's the mathematician,"
00:30:50,00:30:53,"who's like the father of probability, really."
00:30:53,00:30:57,"And the idea that a lot of places say, I don't know if this is true,"
00:30:57,00:31:00,"that he was trying to make a perpetual motion machine,"
00:31:00,00:31:02,"which would make it a really bad game of roulette, wouldn't it?"
00:31:02,00:31:03,- Very dull.
00:31:03,00:31:07,"- The ball just comes from never, and ever, and ever."
00:31:07,00:31:10,"- Well, the diaper would come in handy in that case."
00:31:10,00:31:12,(upbeat music)
00:31:12,00:31:17,"- Okay, it's time for our final fact of the show."
00:31:17,00:31:18,And that is my fact.
00:31:18,00:31:21,"My fact this week is to promote his new product,"
00:31:21,00:31:25,"the inventor of Vaseline, would demonstrate his invention"
00:31:25,00:31:29,by dipping his hands in acid and then healing the burn wounds
00:31:29,00:31:30,with the balm.
00:31:30,00:31:32,"- Dedicated to his product, I'd buy it after that."
00:31:32,00:31:35,"- Yeah, well, how quickly does Vaseline work?"
00:31:35,00:31:38,"- So this is, okay, so we've mentioned this guy very briefly,"
00:31:38,00:31:41,"he just got on the podcast, his name is Robert Chesa-Brue,"
00:31:41,00:31:42,which does--
00:31:42,00:31:43,- I call him Chisbrue.
00:31:43,00:31:44,"- I really wanna call him Chisbrue,"
00:31:44,00:31:48,"and I googled how to pronounce his name a bunch of times,"
00:31:48,00:31:49,and it came up with Chesa-Brue.
00:31:49,00:31:50,"- Okay, let's call him Chisbrue."
00:31:50,00:31:51,- Chisbrue is way better.
00:31:51,00:31:56,"So yeah, Robert Chisbrue, he patented the balm Vaseline in 1872."
00:31:56,00:31:58,So he had this new invention.
00:31:58,00:32:01,He'd spent 10 years experimenting on himself
00:32:01,00:32:02,to see that it would work.
00:32:02,00:32:04,"But for the time, it was hard to convince people"
00:32:04,00:32:06,that it had any practical use.
00:32:06,00:32:08,"So he became one of those traveling salesmen,"
00:32:08,00:32:11,"and he went to department stores all over New York,"
00:32:11,00:32:14,where he would arrive at the location and do a demonstration.
00:32:14,00:32:17,"The demonstration consisted of him dipping his hand in acid,"
00:32:17,00:32:20,"or sometimes holding his hand over an open flame,"
00:32:20,00:32:22,"burning himself, and then putting the balm on,"
00:32:22,00:32:24,and then showing his other hand
00:32:24,00:32:27,"that he had done a demonstration on the day before,"
00:32:27,00:32:28,and how it had healed it up.
00:32:28,00:32:30,"Yeah, so it was one hand at a time."
00:32:30,00:32:32,"- Oh, wow, so it was the blue Peter of his day."
00:32:32,00:32:33,- Exactly.
00:32:33,00:32:34,- So he was one I made earlier.
00:32:34,00:32:35,"- Yeah, exactly."
00:32:35,00:32:37,"- A lot of trust in that demonstration, though, isn't there?"
00:32:37,00:32:39,"- Yes, yeah."
00:32:39,00:32:40,"- 'Cause it fit, I mean, you're trusting"
00:32:40,00:32:42,"that he had done that the day before,"
00:32:42,00:32:44,and he's not just every single day putting his one
00:32:44,00:32:47,"with a hand in it, and so that's it."
00:32:47,00:32:48,I bet it was his left hand always
00:32:48,00:32:50,"that he put it in acid, isn't it?"
00:32:50,00:32:51,- That's true.
00:32:51,00:32:55,"- Yeah, but so he did that and used to travel all over."
00:32:55,00:32:59,It was real frontline salesmanship from Old Cheeseborough.
00:32:59,00:33:01,"- He would, he had a horse and cart, didn't he?"
00:33:01,00:33:02,"And he would give away samples,"
00:33:02,00:33:04,and apparently this is the first time
00:33:04,00:33:06,people gave away samples of any products.
00:33:06,00:33:07,"- Wow, that's a very good one."
00:33:07,00:33:09,"- I don't know if that's, it doesn't sound true, does it?"
00:33:09,00:33:10,"It sounds like someone else must have thought of it,"
00:33:10,00:33:12,but this is the first example that we've found.
00:33:12,00:33:15,"- So he used to, Chesaborough or Cheeseborough,"
00:33:15,00:33:20,"whatever his name is, he used to have a distilled"
00:33:20,00:33:22,"sperm whale oil business, so yeah,"
00:33:22,00:33:24,and that started becoming redundant
00:33:24,00:33:27,"because the oil industry became huge,"
00:33:27,00:33:28,"and he was basically going bust,"
00:33:28,00:33:32,"and he used his very last few dollars to go to Pennsylvania,"
00:33:32,00:33:36,and he was going to get a job in the oil industry.
00:33:36,00:33:40,And he noticed all these oil workers were always complaining
00:33:40,00:33:41,"about the stuff called Rodwax,"
00:33:41,00:33:43,which is a black gunk that glued up the drill heads
00:33:43,00:33:45,and then came out and cleaned it off.
00:33:45,00:33:46,"And he got curious about this,"
00:33:46,00:33:48,"and he took a bucket of it home and he thought,"
00:33:48,00:33:51,"because if they got wounds and burns and cuts and things,"
00:33:51,00:33:53,"they smeared on it, it seemed to get better."
00:33:53,00:33:55,"I don't think it's got healing qualities, actually,"
00:33:55,00:33:57,"but what it does, it keeps the dirt out of it,"
00:33:57,00:33:59,that's one reason it's good for you.
00:33:59,00:34:00,"- Yeah, and keeps moisture in, doesn't it?"
00:34:00,00:34:01,- He was fascinated by this.
00:34:01,00:34:04,He took this home and his dad said he spent years and years
00:34:04,00:34:06,experimenting to turn it from this black goo
00:34:06,00:34:10,"into this very clear, almost translucent balm."
00:34:10,00:34:13,And did you know he was a Brit?
00:34:13,00:34:14,"- No, I was a Brit."
00:34:14,00:34:15,- So he was American.
00:34:15,00:34:17,"- No, he worked in America, but he was actually a Brit,"
00:34:17,00:34:19,and Queen Victoria used Vaseline.
00:34:19,00:34:22,"We don't know why, she was a big fan,"
00:34:22,00:34:25,and she actually knighted him in 1883.
00:34:25,00:34:27,"- But unfortunately, the sod slipped off his shell."
00:34:27,00:34:29,(laughing)
00:34:29,00:34:31,'Cause he did used to cover himself in it.
00:34:31,00:34:33,That's the one thing that we mentioned.
00:34:33,00:34:35,He thought that it was just this amazing thing
00:34:35,00:34:37,"that would cure everything,"
00:34:37,00:34:38,and he thought there was some special stuff in it
00:34:38,00:34:40,that would make him better.
00:34:40,00:34:42,"And he got pleuricy and he covered his whole body in it,"
00:34:42,00:34:43,"and he did actually get better,"
00:34:43,00:34:45,but probably not 'cause of that.
00:34:45,00:34:50,"- Well, he lived in '96, and he got sick in his late '50s."
00:34:50,00:34:55,And he hired a private nurse who was instructed
00:34:55,00:34:58,"to rub him down, whole body rubbed down in Vaseline every day."
00:34:58,00:34:59,- I can't matter that job.
00:34:59,00:35:03,"- And he had just been full of it, literally every day,"
00:35:03,00:35:06,and he attributed his longevity to exactly that.
00:35:06,00:35:07,- Yeah.
00:35:07,00:35:10,"- I mean, you would if it's your big business, right?"
00:35:10,00:35:11,- You would say that.
00:35:11,00:35:13,- He was secretly taking a lot of sort of morphine
00:35:13,00:35:15,and aracy to hold.
00:35:15,00:35:16,(laughing)
00:35:16,00:35:19,"- But I dug out some other uses of Vaseline,"
00:35:19,00:35:20,apart from the obvious.
00:35:20,00:35:21,- Oh yeah.
00:35:21,00:35:26,"- So it has been smeared on fish hooks to lure trout,"
00:35:26,00:35:28,"treat nappy rash, and toenail fungus."
00:35:28,00:35:30,"It's used for staunching nose bleeds,"
00:35:30,00:35:33,removing ring marks from furniture.
00:35:33,00:35:36,"It's dabbed on cheeks by actresses to simulate tears,"
00:35:36,00:35:38,"removing makeup, predicting gun barrels,"
00:35:38,00:35:39,"shining patent leather shoes,"
00:35:39,00:35:41,lubricating slide rules.
00:35:41,00:35:43,That's a neat use.
00:35:43,00:35:44,(laughing)
00:35:44,00:35:45,- That's a use for this afraid or sex issue.
00:35:45,00:35:48,(laughing)
00:35:48,00:35:50,"- And then the moustache wax, sunscreen,"
00:35:50,00:35:52,anti-failing for boats.
00:35:52,00:35:55,"It's used by ear, nose, and throat surgeons"
00:35:55,00:35:57,to combat nasal crusting.
00:35:57,00:35:58,- Ooh!
00:35:58,00:35:59,- I don't want to get nasal crusting
00:35:59,00:36:01,"when you're under the knife, do you know?"
00:36:01,00:36:01,(laughing)
00:36:01,00:36:03,"- I like the one I really like is,"
00:36:03,00:36:06,"it's supposedly used in boxing before a fight,"
00:36:06,00:36:08,so that a punch doesn't quite land on your face
00:36:08,00:36:10,and sort of slips off as you are doing.
00:36:10,00:36:12,"- You see them put it on the cheekbones, do you?"
00:36:12,00:36:14,"- Yeah, and they're not allowed to do it mid-fight,"
00:36:14,00:36:16,"and some people are caught doing it,"
00:36:16,00:36:17,so the coaches will come over
00:36:17,00:36:19,and subtly Vaseline their face up.
00:36:19,00:36:22,"- In American football, if you're trying to stop"
00:36:22,00:36:24,"someone from getting to your quarterback,"
00:36:24,00:36:25,"you're not allowed to hold them, that's a big thing."
00:36:25,00:36:26,"You're allowed to block them,"
00:36:26,00:36:27,but not hold them.
00:36:27,00:36:28,- Yeah.
00:36:28,00:36:31,- And so people would put Vaseline on their whole bodies
00:36:31,00:36:32,so that when you're putting your hands out
00:36:32,00:36:35,"onto the chest to block them, they just slip away from you."
00:36:35,00:36:36,- Wow.
00:36:36,00:36:39,"- But the defensive people, they kind of go against it"
00:36:39,00:36:42,by putting like drawing pins in their gloves
00:36:42,00:36:43,"and like thumbtacks in their gloves,"
00:36:43,00:36:45,so they can grip on even better.
00:36:45,00:36:46,- Is that allowed?
00:36:46,00:36:48,- I don't think it is allowed.
00:36:48,00:36:49,"It doesn't sound allowed,"
00:36:49,00:36:51,but I think people still do it.
00:36:51,00:36:52,- Wow.
00:36:52,00:36:54,"- There was John, you're a director,"
00:36:54,00:36:55,you've done a lot of advert director.
00:36:55,00:36:56,- Yeah.
00:36:56,00:36:58,- So do you know about the fact that it's used as a technique
00:36:58,00:37:00,to make a sort of soft focus effect?
00:37:00,00:37:01,- Yes.
00:37:01,00:37:02,- Yeah.
00:37:02,00:37:03,- So they smear Vaseline on the lens of a camera.
00:37:03,00:37:06,- They'd say entry that put some Vaseline on the lens.
00:37:06,00:37:07,"- Yeah, it's extraordinary."
00:37:07,00:37:10,It's used in a lot of soft core porn.
00:37:10,00:37:12,"- You know, you get that sort of thing where it's like"
00:37:12,00:37:15,"a dreamy look around the face, the actress or whatever."
00:37:15,00:37:16,- You can imagine.
00:37:16,00:37:17,And I didn't know you had such a strong career
00:37:17,00:37:19,in the porn industry before.
00:37:19,00:37:20,"- Yes, absolutely."
00:37:20,00:37:21,(laughing)
00:37:21,00:37:23,- It was lubricating slide rules before you.
00:37:23,00:37:26,(laughing)
00:37:26,00:37:28,"- So they use it in Star Trek, for example."
00:37:28,00:37:32,Any time that Captain Kirk played by William Shatner
00:37:32,00:37:35,would see a girl that was gonna be the girl of the week
00:37:35,00:37:36,as it were.
00:37:36,00:37:38,They would use this soft focus on that girl.
00:37:38,00:37:40,"- So he goes, ""Mr. D.R."""
00:37:40,00:37:40,- Yeah.
00:37:40,00:37:41,"- It looks like he's gone, ""Mr. D.R."""
00:37:41,00:37:42,- Yeah.
00:37:42,00:37:44,- So I think I saw a remember that in Star Trek.
00:37:44,00:37:47,"- And Doris Day, the actress used to have in her contract"
00:37:47,00:37:50,that close-ups when she got older all had to be done
00:37:50,00:37:52,in soft focus because she was too worried
00:37:52,00:37:55,"about her, the lines on her face and so on."
00:37:55,00:37:56,- Really?
00:37:56,00:37:58,"- Yeah, so there's movies with her in Rock Hudson,"
00:37:58,00:38:00,where Rock Hudson is in clear shot
00:38:00,00:38:02,as a close-up cut to Doris Day.
00:38:02,00:38:04,"She's in the street, and it looks really odd."
00:38:04,00:38:05,- That is so weird.
00:38:05,00:38:06,- Yeah.
00:38:06,00:38:09,"- They also, I just found one use on smearing over glass."
00:38:09,00:38:12,"One use for it related to that, if you're a burglar,"
00:38:12,00:38:14,was uncovered in 2012 when someone went around
00:38:14,00:38:16,burglaring apartments.
00:38:16,00:38:18,And people realized that he was doing the same thing
00:38:18,00:38:20,"every apartment he burgled, which was smearing Vaseline"
00:38:20,00:38:22,over the opposite apartment's people.
00:38:22,00:38:25,"So when they looked out of their people, they couldn't see him"
00:38:25,00:38:26,and I don't know why he thought they couldn't open
00:38:26,00:38:27,their own doors.
00:38:27,00:38:29,"- Or they thought, ""Who's that dreamy guy?"""
00:38:29,00:38:31,(all laughing)
00:38:31,00:38:33,- Burgling that house.
00:38:33,00:38:35,Harrison Ford would never rob a home.
00:38:35,00:38:36,(all laughing)
00:38:36,00:38:38,- And you should mention me in commercials
00:38:38,00:38:41,and Captain Kirk in the same paragraph.
00:38:41,00:38:43,Just two of the ads I shot were actually
00:38:43,00:38:44,with William Chatner.
00:38:44,00:38:45,- Oh really?
00:38:45,00:38:47,"- Yeah, in LA for Kellogg's, yeah."
00:38:47,00:38:48,- Really?
00:38:48,00:38:49,"- He was great, he was such a good guy."
00:38:49,00:38:51,I got really well with him.
00:38:51,00:38:52,"Very, very funny."
00:38:52,00:38:53,- Really?
00:38:53,00:38:55,- Did he demand the Vaseline for every shot?
00:38:55,00:38:56,- No.
00:38:56,00:38:59,(all laughing)
00:38:59,00:39:01,"- Oh, just one interesting thing about Vaseline,"
00:39:01,00:39:03,something else that it was very important
00:39:03,00:39:06,in the invention of was mascara.
00:39:06,00:39:09,So modern mascara was invented when a woman
00:39:09,00:39:12,"called Mabel Williams, this was in 1915,"
00:39:12,00:39:14,she sort of singed her eyebrows and eyelashes
00:39:14,00:39:16,in a kitchen fire.
00:39:16,00:39:18,And she wanted to make her eyelashes look longer again.
00:39:18,00:39:20,And so she came up with this homemade technique
00:39:20,00:39:23,of mixing ash and coal with Vaseline.
00:39:23,00:39:27,And then she applied her eyelashes and did the trick.
00:39:27,00:39:29,"Her brother Tom, weirdly watching her,"
00:39:29,00:39:31,"watching her, spying on her"
00:39:31,00:39:34,and decided to try and recreate this and commercialize it.
00:39:34,00:39:35,"So he used a friend's chemistry set,"
00:39:35,00:39:38,"mixed it all together, made modern mascara"
00:39:38,00:39:40,"and named it after her, named it Maybelline."
00:39:40,00:39:41,"- No, that's Maybelline?"
00:39:41,00:39:42,That's your own Maybelline.
00:39:42,00:39:43,- Maybelline.
00:39:43,00:39:43,- That's really good.
00:39:43,00:39:44,That's great.
00:39:44,00:39:45,- Very cool.
00:39:45,00:39:50,"So speaking of burns, there is one thing"
00:39:50,00:39:52,that's used for treating burns
00:39:52,00:39:57,and that is poo shakes and that is like a milkshake
00:39:57,00:39:59,but it's made with poo.
00:39:59,00:40:01,And this is in New South Wales
00:40:01,00:40:04,and it's the Pot Macarie Koala Hospital.
00:40:04,00:40:06,Obviously they had a lot of fires in Australia recently
00:40:06,00:40:09,and love the koala's got burned.
00:40:09,00:40:12,"And they found that by feeding them these poo milkshakes,"
00:40:12,00:40:15,the koalas are getting better a lot quicker.
00:40:15,00:40:19,And it's basically your old gut bacteria thing.
00:40:19,00:40:22,"So when you're a baby koala, you eat pap,"
00:40:22,00:40:25,which is a mixture of digested half digested food
00:40:25,00:40:28,and bacteria is created in the mother's gut
00:40:28,00:40:32,and comes out through the seacum and the joey eats it.
00:40:32,00:40:34,And so what they're doing is they're trying to come up
00:40:34,00:40:38,with a way of imitating this by making these poo milkshakes
00:40:38,00:40:40,and they give them to the koalas
00:40:40,00:40:42,and it just helps them to put on weight.
00:40:42,00:40:45,It just helps them to get generally better
00:40:45,00:40:47,and that makes the burns heal more quickly.
00:40:47,00:40:48,"- Okay, because it sort of builds up their immune system"
00:40:48,00:40:50,against the burns.
00:40:50,00:40:52,"- That's treating burns from the inside,"
00:40:52,00:40:53,which is such a cool.
00:40:53,00:40:54,- Inside out.
00:40:54,00:40:55,- Yeah.
00:40:55,00:40:59,"- My favourite burns, burns related story is,"
00:40:59,00:41:01,which is in the 1940s.
00:41:01,00:41:03,And scientists wanted to come up with a pain scale.
00:41:03,00:41:05,"They wanted to create the pain unit, the dull law."
00:41:05,00:41:08,"And they decided the way they were going to do this,"
00:41:08,00:41:10,where they were going to measure pain
00:41:10,00:41:13,and work out the scale was by taking women in labor
00:41:13,00:41:15,and then burning them repeatedly.
00:41:15,00:41:17,And then asking them to compare the sensation
00:41:17,00:41:19,of being burned to being in labor.
00:41:19,00:41:21,"And the women were keen to do, they were interested."
00:41:21,00:41:23,They tended to be the wives of the doctors and the nurses.
00:41:23,00:41:25,"They were like, yeah, fine, I'm gonna be in pain anyway."
00:41:25,00:41:27,And so they have these women who were in labor
00:41:27,00:41:28,going through contractions.
00:41:28,00:41:31,And then they just like burn their finger with a lighter
00:41:31,00:41:33,"and say, how bad is that compared to your contraction?"
00:41:33,00:41:37,"And they were gonna be like, yeah, it's about the same."
00:41:37,00:41:38,And then it got worse and worse.
00:41:38,00:41:39,And they found they said that the problem was
00:41:39,00:41:40,"that as contractions progressed,"
00:41:40,00:41:42,the women became less good at coherently describing
00:41:42,00:41:44,their feelings.
00:41:44,00:41:46,So the researchers had to make inferences
00:41:46,00:41:48,about their pain based on their behavior.
00:41:48,00:41:51,"So I think when she told me to go fuck myself,"
00:41:51,00:41:53,I'll put that down as a tab.
00:41:53,00:41:56,[LAUGHTER]
00:41:56,00:41:58,But that's amazing.
00:41:58,00:42:01,"Is the idea a bit like how, you know, if you have a splinter"
00:42:01,00:42:03,"and then you break your ankle, you forget about the splinter."
00:42:03,00:42:05,Is it that kind of thing?
00:42:05,00:42:06,It's not that idea.
00:42:06,00:42:08,"The idea was that they thought that going,"
00:42:08,00:42:10,the peak of labor was maximum pain.
00:42:10,00:42:12,So that would be max on the scale.
00:42:12,00:42:14,"And then they wanted the women to quantify, be like,"
00:42:14,00:42:18,all that burn is about a tenth as bad as the labor pain I've just felt.
00:42:18,00:42:22,But women got less and less good at perfectly rationalizing that pain.
00:42:22,00:42:25,"Do you know, before QI was a thing,"
00:42:25,00:42:29,"I saw a little email group, six of us, they were in the group."
00:42:29,00:42:33,And we said this thing called the quite boring challenge.
00:42:33,00:42:34,Do you know this story?
00:42:34,00:42:34,No.
00:42:34,00:42:37,And the idea was one of us would nominate every week
00:42:37,00:42:40,a subject about which nothing interesting was or could be known.
00:42:40,00:42:41,OK.
00:42:41,00:42:43,"And I started an I nominated Chumford,"
00:42:43,00:42:45,because I grew up from near Chumford.
00:42:45,00:42:47,And I spent a week researching Chumford.
00:42:47,00:42:50,It was a fascinating facts I came up with.
00:42:50,00:42:57,"And one of them is this, is that largest burns unit in Europe is in Chumford, in S6."
00:42:57,00:43:01,"And for 30 years, the Conservative MP for Chumford was Simon Burns."
00:43:01,00:43:03,"Oh, great."
00:43:03,00:43:03,OK.
00:43:03,00:43:05,"Yeah, he was knighted in 2015."
00:43:05,00:43:09,"He's the second cousin of David Bowie, of Bizarre."
00:43:09,00:43:13,"But because he was educated at Worcester College, Oxford, where he got a third,"
00:43:13,00:43:16,he's known by his friends as third-degree burns.
00:43:16,00:43:21,"No, it's amazing when those QI facts come together."
00:43:21,00:43:28,"OK, that's it."
00:43:28,00:43:30,That is all of our facts.
00:43:30,00:43:31,Thank you so much for listening.

00:44:07,00:44:11,"because, John, you're now at the manager of a band waiting for Smith."
00:44:11,00:44:11,Yeah.
00:44:11,00:44:13,And we've got their single here.
00:44:13,00:44:13,Yeah.

00:44:21,00:44:21,OK.
00:44:21,00:44:23,"Well, we'll see you all again next week."
00:44:23,00:44:24,And the player's out now.
00:44:24,00:44:25,It's waiting for Smith.
00:44:25,00:44:26,We're so much love.
