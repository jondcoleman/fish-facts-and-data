1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,300
 - Hey everybody, welcome to this week's episode of Fish.

2
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:04,480
 We have a very exciting guest on this week.

3
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:05,600
 - Yes, is it Andy?

4
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:06,800
 - It's not Andy.

5
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:08,680
 Yeah, no, Andy is still a guest.

6
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:11,080
 We consider him a guest of the show.

7
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:12,680
 But no, he was busy this week, so.

8
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:14,520
 - I thought what I was saying is Andy isn't here.

9
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:16,320
 - Yeah, that's effectively.

10
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,680
 But I still, I feel the guest thing.

11
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:23,480
 No, very excitingly, we have the founder of QI, John Lloyd himself.

12
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:25,480
 He's been on a few times.

13
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:27,440
 This is the guy who gave us not the nine o'clock news.

14
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:29,240
 Black Adder, spitting image.

15
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:32,720
 He helped create Mr. Bean, co-wrote to the original radio episodes

16
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:34,120
 of Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.

17
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:37,520
 - Yes, he exact produced a short-lived television show.

18
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:38,520
 Those things are the news.

19
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:40,440
 - Which he says is the highlight of his career.

20
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:41,840
 I don't know if he means the ending of it

21
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:45,640
 or the experience itself, but he's now turned himself

22
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:47,720
 into a music manager.

23
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:49,960
 The band that he looks after is called Waiting for Smith.

24
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:52,560
 And if you hang out, listener, to the end of this episode,

25
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:54,000
 we're actually gonna play a track

26
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,360
 from Waiting for Smith, their latest singer.

27
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:57,840
 - You don't have to listen to it all.

28
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,680
 You can fast forward the whole episode.

29
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:01,360
 - It just gets straight to the song.

30
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:04,640
 - No, no, experience the show without our guest Andy

31
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:09,120
 and see how it feels and give us feedback of what you think.

32
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,760
 Anyway, he was a fantastic guest.

33
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:12,800
 It's always amazing to get loydy on the show

34
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:14,440
 and have a listen at the end.

35
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:15,920
 And yeah, enjoy the show.

36
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:18,680
 (upbeat music)

37
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:22,600
 (upbeat music)

38
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:32,200
 - Hello and welcome to another episode

39
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:35,000
 of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast

40
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,440
 coming to you from the QI offices in Covert Garden.

41
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:39,760
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

42
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:43,240
 I am sitting here with James Harkin, Anna Chazinski

43
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:45,360
 and Chief Nome John Lloyd.

44
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,640
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones

45
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:50,600
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days

46
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:53,640
 and in no particular order, here we go.

47
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,640
 Starting with you, John.

48
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:59,880
 - Right, my fact is that when the Greek government

49
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:03,240
 put a tax on swimming pools in 2008,

50
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:07,680
 only 324 Athenians admitted to having one.

51
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:11,080
 A search by Google Earth Hava revealed the actual number,

52
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:14,400
 16,974.

53
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,880
 (laughing)

54
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:16,720
 - It's incredible.

55
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,800
 - It's bare face, isn't it?

56
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,240
 According to the IMF, more than half of all Greek households

57
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:24,400
 pay no income tax at all.

58
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,240
 - Wow.

59
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:27,320
 - And Greece has got the largest black market

60
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:31,840
 in the whole Eurozone, accounting for 21.5% of its GDP.

61
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,440
 There's a reason for this, I believe.

62
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:37,240
 I was when I was in Greece last year.

63
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,960
 Somebody explained why this is,

64
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:41,600
 why the Greeks are so poor at playing their taxes.

65
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:42,760
 Because for a thousand years,

66
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:44,360
 they were part of the Ottoman Empire,

67
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,640
 which they absolutely hated.

68
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:48,480
 And it was considered a patriotic national duty,

69
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,040
 not to pay your taxes.

70
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,720
 - Well, and they just haven't caught up with the history

71
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:54,680
 that the Ottoman Empire fell apart a hundred years ago.

72
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,240
 - I think there are some traditions

73
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:58,000
 that you really want to bring back immediately

74
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
 and maybe pay in taxes not one of them.

75
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,760
 It has a bit lower down on the list.

76
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,600
 - You're right.

77
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:03,440
 - I love these pools,

78
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,480
 'cause it feels as if they were prepared

79
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:07,040
 for this Google Earth search,

80
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,400
 because they all hide them with camouflage.

81
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,360
 - How do you hide a pool?

82
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:13,560
 - Okay, so they have floating tiles

83
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,880
 that they put on the top of their pool.

84
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:15,720
 - Very clever.

85
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:16,880
 - Yep, they have army nets,

86
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:19,000
 so they camouflage it all together.

87
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,080
 And some even paint the interior of their pools

88
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,280
 to mimic grass.

89
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,120
 - Wow.

90
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:24,960
 - Wow.

91
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:25,800
 - Oh, it's brilliant.

92
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:26,640
 - It's extraordinary.

93
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:27,880
 - So the first Google Earth search said no swimming pools,

94
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:29,600
 but an extraordinary number of army nets

95
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:32,200
 in people's garden with no apparent reason.

96
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:34,560
 - The Greeks have a really good history of paying taxes,

97
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,800
 'cause in ancient Greek,

98
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:38,440
 they had a really good system of paying tax.

99
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:40,560
 And that is that the assembly in Athens

100
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:44,160
 would pick the richest people to pay tax.

101
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:46,320
 The top 300 in some cases.

102
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:49,520
 And they would just say you have to pay for this parade

103
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,720
 and this battleship and this whatever.

104
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:52,560
 - Really?

105
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,520
 - And they all agreed.

106
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:56,520
 They even competed to spend as much money as possible,

107
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:58,360
 because it was a real kind of thing

108
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:00,920
 where you would get respect from people and gratitude.

109
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:03,560
 And if you were one of the people who paid tax,

110
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:06,400
 it really increased your standing in the community.

111
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,760
 And people really liked you for it.

112
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,440
 So everyone wanted to pay tax.

113
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:10,280
 - Okay.

114
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,640
 - Everyone wanted to be in that 300.

115
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:13,680
 - I wonder if you got your name stamped on the event

116
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,040
 as well, like the liviest parade.

117
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:16,880
 - You did?

118
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,320
 Yeah, did you all you paid the more likely

119
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,720
 you were to get your name on something?

120
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,880
 - So this is kind of like those philanthropists who,

121
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:24,520
 I don't know if you mentioned after Notre Dame burned down,

122
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:26,960
 the philanthropists who really wanted to donate millions

123
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,040
 and then it turned out they kind of only wanted to do it

124
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,720
 if the bell was renamed, you know,

125
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:34,520
 the ex-person, your name was Bell.

126
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:35,360
 - Trump Bell.

127
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,880
 - Yeah, Ikea, wing of Notre Dame.

128
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:43,800
 They're not the worst taxpayers in the world, the Greeks, though.

129
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:47,000
 The Chinese, only 2% of Chinese pay any income tax.

130
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,760
 And in Pakistan, it's 1%.

131
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:51,120
 I mean, you wonder how these countries operate?

132
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:55,360
 - Especially China, which operates entirely as government, yeah.

133
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:58,080
 I suppose it's just hard to get into those hard to reach spots,

134
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:58,920
 isn't it?

135
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,520
 We've all had that itch on our back.

136
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:02,400
 It's kind of quite big, guys.

137
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,440
 - I was kind of nervous researching this topic

138
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:08,320
 'cause my Google searches were like amazing tax dodges

139
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:11,040
 and we're coming up to the end of the tax year.

140
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:14,720
 But I found tax dodges quite fun the way the people got--

141
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,000
 - Again, researching them, right?

142
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,320
 - Resurrecting them, just--

143
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:18,160
 - Ah!

144
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:24,080
 - That's my accountant there, Jimmy.

145
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:27,360
 - Yeah, no, early England tax is like the 1700s.

146
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,520
 So there's so many great ways that people try to get around

147
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,240
 all the taxes that were being thrown at them.

148
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:34,840
 So there was tax on bricks, for example, in houses.

149
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:37,160
 So one of the dodges that they used to do was people

150
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:39,200
 just used to use bigger bricks.

151
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,040
 So you use less brick.

152
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:40,880
 - Oh, really?

153
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:41,720
 - Perhaps, yeah.

154
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,760
 - Yeah, I did, you could just use four bricks, one for each wall.

155
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:46,880
 - Exactly, and then they call onto that.

156
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:50,480
 So they eventually taxed big bricks as well.

157
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:53,000
 - Did it, by the way, that's actually a bit like with cheese.

158
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,200
 You know the origin of big cheese wheels is based on the fact

159
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,360
 that cheese used to be taxed by number of cheeses

160
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:00,280
 in Switzerland, rather than by weight.

161
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:03,120
 And so people would just make bigger and bigger giant cheeses.

162
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,120
 And that's why we have them.

163
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:07,640
 And now the average emmental is three feet diameter

164
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:09,200
 and weighs 220 pounds.

165
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:11,120
 And uses one and a half tons of milk

166
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,960
 'cause it just gets the same amount of taxes.

167
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:13,800
 And many one.

168
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:14,880
 - That's a mini baby bell.

169
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:15,720
 - And baby bell?

170
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:16,880
 - Yeah.

171
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:19,280
 - I was just looking at the quite famous case,

172
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,160
 the jaffa cake case on tax.

173
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:23,120
 So you know, there's always this debate over where

174
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,680
 the cake, the cakes or biscuits debate.

175
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,600
 And that originates in 1991.

176
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,720
 I think it was, and it's because cakes are traditionally

177
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,520
 in a lot of countries actually are not subject

178
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:35,520
 to VAT sales tax, whereas biscuits with chocolate on our

179
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,280
 'cause cakes were seen as a necessity

180
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,120
 'cause it used to be, you know,

181
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:40,000
 your working household would make a cake.

182
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,720
 But yeah, in 1991, McVitties insisted jaffa cake was a cake.

183
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:46,400
 And so they agreed it had biscuit tendencies,

184
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:49,600
 but then had to argue overall that it had more cake elements.

185
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,360
 And as part of the, like in court,

186
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,680
 as part of the evidence for the fact that it was a cake,

187
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:57,320
 McVitties baked a one foot diameter jaffa cake

188
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:59,200
 to show this is actually a cake.

189
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,600
 And the courts can cut.

190
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,240
 And it's been a cake ever since.

191
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,080
 - That's not cool.

192
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:03,920
 - Yeah, it's amazing.

193
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,240
 - Do you know the difference in cakes and biscuits?

194
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,080
 How you tell?

195
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:06,920
 - How you tell?

196
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:09,520
 - Because when they go stale, biscuits go soft

197
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:10,600
 and cakes go hard.

198
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,600
 - Yeah.

199
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,600
 - Oh, that's cool.

200
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,280
 - But they didn't have the time to sit in the court

201
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:18,200
 for sort of three weeks, watching the jaffa cake go stale.

202
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:20,520
 This is also actually the case with gingerbread men.

203
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:22,600
 So a gingerbread man counts as a cake

204
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:25,360
 and counts as a biscuit that's exempt from tax

205
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,840
 'cause it's got no chocolate on it.

206
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:29,320
 Until it has a certain amount of chocolate.

207
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:31,640
 So if you've got a gingerbread man just with eyes,

208
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:34,080
 but naked, no tax on it.

209
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:37,200
 But then it'll cost 20% more if it's got one button.

210
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,040
 - No.

211
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,280
 (laughing)

212
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,680
 - One button on its shirt.

213
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:43,000
 - Who in their right mind is adding that one button?

214
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
 - No, I don't know.

215
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,200
 These people are missing a trick.

216
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:48,640
 - It's odd that the people who are best at paying taxes

217
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:50,040
 are Americans strangely enough.

218
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:50,880
 - Oh yeah.

219
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:51,720
 - That's slightly surprising.

220
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:55,000
 81 to 84% of Americans don't cheat on their taxes

221
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,280
 compared to 68% of Germans and 62% of Italians.

222
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:59,880
 - Are these self-reported figures?

223
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,720
 (laughing)

224
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:04,720
 - But it did really shocking actually how much

225
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:08,840
 tax avoidance goes on, not just Apple and Amazon.

226
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:12,000
 Amazon has not paid any federal taxes in America

227
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,200
 even though it makes profits of billions.

228
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:19,440
 And there's $8.7 trillion worth of the world's wealth

229
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,760
 hidden away in tax havens by the rich.

230
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:23,120
 That has a lot of money.

231
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:25,200
 - Isn't it something like the fifth biggest country

232
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:28,200
 in the world if it was a country, isn't it?

233
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:32,240
 Something like that, I think, for the biggest in terms of income.

234
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:35,280
 The tax haven country, whatever we're calling that.

235
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:37,040
 - Where does that sounds great?

236
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:38,040
 (laughing)

237
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:38,880
 We know where it is.

238
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:39,720
 - It's very wealthy.

239
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:40,880
 It's wherever you want it to be, Dad.

240
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:43,440
 - The UK is king of tax havens.

241
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,280
 I mean, we don't have anyone else in the world.

242
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:46,120
 - Yeah, exactly.

243
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,640
 We talk about Greece and whoever,

244
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:50,840
 but British, the Cayman Islands belongs to Britain,

245
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,520
 the Virgin Islands belongs to Britain.

246
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:53,360
 - Bermuda.

247
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,200
 - Bermuda, yeah.

248
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,000
 - I love man.

249
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:55,840
 - Yeah.

250
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:58,120
 - The Virgin Islands goes on on. - The Virgin Islands.

251
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,960
 - The Virgin Islands. - The Virgin Islands.

252
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,320
 - Did you realise you were taxis then?

253
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:03,280
 - No, we're a bit like those villages in China.

254
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:05,720
 It's very difficult for the tax ones to get down to Bolton.

255
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:07,520
 - Tough itch to scratch, Bolton.

256
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:10,400
 - So one of those honest Americans is Warren Buffett,

257
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:13,200
 who's been paying income tax since he was 14.

258
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,040
 - Wow.

259
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:15,440
 - He had a paper round.

260
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:20,440
 And in 1944, he paid tax of $7 on an income of $592,

261
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:24,080
 which would be equivalent to about 8,000 pounds today.

262
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,480
 He had a pretty enterprising 14-year-old.

263
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,000
 - That's a lot of newspapers, isn't it?

264
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,400
 - Yeah, another guy who paid £7 tax was the

265
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,400
 longest-serving Prime Minister of Pakistan.

266
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:37,120
 He was a guy called Noah's Sharif,

267
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:40,240
 who was in office for nine years on three separate occasions.

268
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:43,960
 At one point, he had a personal fortune of two billion pounds,

269
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,360
 but over a period of several years,

270
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,200
 paid only just seven pounds into tax.

271
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,040
 - Wow, the same one.

272
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:49,440
 - My wife and he bothers Bermuda.

273
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,080
 It's like, yeah, this is it.

274
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:53,000
 I'm fessing up here.

275
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,520
 - It's your full seven-quid bag.

276
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:56,520
 (all laughing)

277
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:58,840
 - Shall we say something to stuff on swimming pools?

278
00:09:58,840 --> 00:09:59,680
 - Yeah, sure.

279
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:00,680
 - Let's do that.

280
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:05,080
 So, do you know, name something that you're not allowed

281
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:07,240
 to do with a swimming pool?

282
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:09,360
 - You already have a poo.

283
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,080
 - Oh my, are there any signs on the walls

284
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,560
 to say you can't do that?

285
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:16,680
 - No, that's true, which is why I always challenge them.

286
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:17,680
 (all laughing)

287
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:18,520
 - On the attempt to kick me out.

288
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:20,320
 - Okay, Dave, something that's explicitly told you

289
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:23,080
 that's allowed to do on the wall, - Oh, petting.

290
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:25,200
 - Petting, that's why I'm saying that.

291
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,040
 - Not allowed?

292
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:27,360
 - I mean, who uses that word anymore?

293
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,800
 - Right, so why do they call it heavy petting

294
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,160
 in these swimming pools?

295
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,000
 - Yeah.

296
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,600
 - Because surely it's just snogging or kissing or whatever,

297
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,440
 right?

298
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:38,720
 Well, the reason is, in the 1920s in America,

299
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,920
 they had some things called petting parties,

300
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:44,640
 and high school students would go to swimming pools,

301
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,600
 and they would kind of kiss and cuddle and whatever.

302
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:47,720
 They would never have sex in there,

303
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:50,400
 but they would be getting very close.

304
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:53,200
 And people disapproved, and so they would have signs

305
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,440
 saying no petting on the swimming pools,

306
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:59,120
 and that has kind of kept over for almost 100 years now,

307
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,920
 and you still get heavy petting.

308
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:01,760
 - Really?

309
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,400
 - Signs even though you don't have these parties anymore.

310
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:05,480
 - But you might have them if they took the signs away.

311
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:06,640
 - I'm not saying, yeah.

312
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,760
 - So, is that what a petting zoo is?

313
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:10,120
 (all laughing)

314
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:12,280
 - It is, I had a traumatic childhood, actually,

315
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:14,200
 repeatedly taken to those places.

316
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,200
 (all laughing)

317
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,400
 - To a heavy petting zoo.

318
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:17,800
 (all laughing)

319
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,440
 They were also these petting parties.

320
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,520
 They were also known as necking parties,

321
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:24,080
 mushing parties, fussing parties,

322
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:26,080
 and snuggle-pupping parties.

323
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,080
 - Snuggle-pupping.

324
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:28,840
 - So, I really think it should sell the swimming pool.

325
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:30,040
 No snuggle-puppings.

326
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:31,240
 - No snuggle-puppings.

327
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:32,080
 - Which they won't be,

328
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,400
 'cause everyone will feel too sick

329
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:35,760
 to pet anyone at the phrase snuggle-pupping.

330
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:39,280
 - Because there are no signs actually saying no urinating.

331
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:40,240
 (all laughing)

332
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:43,520
 Public swimming pools contain up to 20 gallons of urine.

333
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:44,360
 - Down.

334
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:45,840
 - Enough to fill a dustbin.

335
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,720
 - And the proportion in hotel jacuzzi

336
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:49,720
 is up to three times worse.

337
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:50,720
 - Wow.

338
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,320
 - Why are people doing it more in a jacuzzi?

339
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,680
 - I think it's the bubbles that you want to go, don't they?

340
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:55,520
 - Do you think?

341
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:56,800
 - Well, I think someone knows.

342
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,840
 (all laughing)

343
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:00,840
 - That study where they found out there was,

344
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:02,920
 do you say 20 gallons of urine?

345
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:03,760
 - Yes.

346
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,280
 - It was really clever how they did it,

347
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:06,720
 because it's quite difficult to work out

348
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,880
 how much urine there is in a swimming pool,

349
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,520
 'cause often the chlorine would change it

350
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:12,480
 into other compounds or whatever.

351
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,960
 But they found a compound in urine

352
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:16,080
 that doesn't react with any other chemicals.

353
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:19,200
 And that is called acesulfane potassium.

354
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:22,240
 And it's a sweetener that you get in lots of like diet drinks

355
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,080
 - Oh yeah.

356
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:26,000
 - And if you urinate that into a swimming pool,

357
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,920
 nothing can get rid of it, so it'll stay there.

358
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:29,840
 And so they could take in the amount of water

359
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:31,200
 and see how much of that was in,

360
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,960
 and then work out the 20 gallons of urine from that.

361
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:36,840
 - Hang on, are we all urinating this sweetener?

362
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:39,240
 - I think they took an average of how much people would.

363
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:41,640
 It's in a lot of foods, it's not just in soft drinks,

364
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:42,680
 it's in a lot of stuff.

365
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:46,120
 And that 20 gallons as well as being a dustbin,

366
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:51,120
 it's approximately 121 bottles worth of urine in the swimming pool.

367
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,560
 - In each swimming pool.

368
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,160
 - And they sell it in Aldi, don't they?

369
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,320
 (laughing)

370
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,160
 That's a terrible slam.

371
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:58,920
 Aldi has a really good wine selection, genuinely.

372
00:12:58,920 --> 00:12:59,760
 - They do, they do, they do.

373
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:00,600
 - I'm sorry.

374
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:01,440
 - They win Aldi Awards.

375
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,840
 - Did you know this thing, another thing they could use,

376
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:05,960
 and I think they do in some places,

377
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:07,240
 silver has got the curious,

378
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:09,320
 property of sterilizing water.

379
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:11,960
 So they could use silver instead of chlorine.

380
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,400
 - And only more expensive, though,

381
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:15,000
 but you know, only tiny amounts,

382
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,040
 you need only 10 parts per billion.

383
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:18,880
 - Wow, 10.

384
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,160
 - And it's completely safe.

385
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,000
 - That's great.

386
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,800
 So in the Olympics, whoever comes second

387
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,000
 could jump in the pool out of the race

388
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,680
 and then clean the pool for the next race.

389
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:27,520
 - Yes.

390
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:29,120
 (laughing)

391
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,240
 - That's really good.

392
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,480
 - You know, when you smell that really strong smell

393
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:33,480
 of chlorine in a pool.

394
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,320
 - Yeah, I like it actually.

395
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:37,040
 - And you think, okay, and you get high off it maybe,

396
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:39,400
 or you think there's too much chlorine in this pool.

397
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:41,080
 Do you know what the problem actually is?

398
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:44,080
 - My nose is too sad to serve.

399
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:44,920
 (laughing)

400
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:46,440
 - No, it's that there's not enough chlorine.

401
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:47,280
 - Oh, yeah.

402
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:48,560
 - So this is, I actually learned this from Dr. Colbert,

403
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:49,560
 this in one of his books,

404
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:52,080
 but if it smells too strongly of chlorine,

405
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,560
 it means they haven't put enough in,

406
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:54,800
 'cause the smell that you're smelling,

407
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:58,000
 it's actually when the chlorine reacts with the nitrogen

408
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,720
 from things like urine and sweat

409
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:01,920
 and dead insects and bacteria and stuff.

410
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:02,760
 It combines with it,

411
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:05,240
 and it makes these chemicals called chloramines.

412
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:07,520
 And the smell comes from this particular chemical

413
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:09,000
 called tri-chloramine.

414
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,920
 So that's very volatile, so you start smelling it.

415
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:12,160
 If you add more chlorine,

416
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,160
 then it keeps reacting,

417
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:14,880
 and it moves on through the chemical process

418
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,200
 and the tri-chloramine goes away.

419
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,040
 - That's incredible.

420
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:17,880
 - That's amazing.

421
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:18,800
 - The smell that I really like

422
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,680
 is actually dead insects and urine.

423
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:22,520
 - That's correct, yes.

424
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:23,840
 That seems true to form, no?

425
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:26,000
 (laughing)

426
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,640
 - Did you know that Clint Eastwood

427
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:29,400
 used to dig swimming pools for a living?

428
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:30,560
 - I think that was easy.

429
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,600
 - Or was he a very enthusiastic grave digger?

430
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:34,120
 (laughing)

431
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:35,560
 He was quite successful, quite young,

432
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:37,440
 and he was sacked by Universal Studios

433
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,400
 because his Adam's apple was too big.

434
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:40,240
 - What?

435
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,080
 - What are you talking about?

436
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,240
 - What do you mean?

437
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,080
 (laughing)

438
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:44,560
 - You're testing this now, aren't you?

439
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:45,840
 That can't be true.

440
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:47,320
 - Well, it is true.

441
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:51,360
 It was on IMDB and on www.clinyswood.net.

442
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,200
 - Oh, there you go.

443
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:55,240
 - Where I also found the fact that his name is an anagram

444
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:56,680
 of Old West Action.

445
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:57,520
 That's quite good.

446
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:58,840
 - That's really good.

447
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:00,520
 - Wow.

448
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:02,240
 Actually, I'm now thinking of Clint Eastwood,

449
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,160
 and he has big Adam's apple.

450
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:05,000
 - You can picture it.

451
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,320
 - Big enough to stop him from digging holes.

452
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:09,360
 - No, he wasn't sacked from the grave digging.

453
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,280
 - I don't know, he was sacked from the movies.

454
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:12,520
 - Oh, right.

455
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:14,240
 - And then he had to get another job.

456
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,480
 - You're gonna scare the mourners.

457
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,240
 - It was swimming pools, it wasn't graves.

458
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,080
 - He was so working.

459
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:21,080
 - When did the Adam's apple thing come in?

460
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:21,920
 - I'm sorry, I've lost it.

461
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:22,760
 - In the '50s.

462
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:24,800
 He was fired by Universal.

463
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,600
 - That was at the start of his career all the time.

464
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:29,760
 - Yeah, he'd been in a couple of sort of B movies,

465
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:32,400
 and then the Adam's apple, they suddenly noticed,

466
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:34,720
 "Hey, that guy there."

467
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:37,120
 Oh my God, it was horrible.

468
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:39,400
 - It was when they started having 3D movies, didn't it,

469
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:41,400
 and people thought it was going to pop up in the eye.

470
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:43,720
 (laughing)

471
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:46,320
 (upbeat music)

472
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:50,880
 - Okay, it's time for fact number two,

473
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,480
 and that is Chazinski.

474
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:55,280
 - My fact this week is that some terraces had heads

475
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:58,640
 that were more than four times the length of their bodies.

476
00:15:58,640 --> 00:15:59,800
 - No.

477
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:01,400
 - How big was that Adam's apple?

478
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:03,480
 (laughing)

479
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:05,840
 - They were such stupid looking creatures.

480
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:09,520
 - So the terraces were tarot dactyl,

481
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:12,360
 as often used as kind of a word for the tarot dactyl,

482
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:13,480
 tarot dactyl actually not a thing,

483
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:16,920
 the tarot dactyl lus was a type of tarot saw.

484
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:20,360
 But yeah, they were the first flying species,

485
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:23,000
 and they started off about 250 million years ago

486
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,680
 with heads nearly as long as their bodies,

487
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:26,800
 and they just extended and extended

488
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:30,720
 until you got some terraces like the Ketsal coactless,

489
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:33,360
 where the heads and the necks were at least triple

490
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:37,120
 the length of the torso, so it took up over 75% of their bodies.

491
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,320
 - It feels like if you're a flying animal,

492
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:41,440
 having a massive head that's three times

493
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:43,440
 big with everything else is probably going to be a problem.

494
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,200
 - You just tip them out the sky all the time.

495
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,040
 - You think so, right?

496
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:48,440
 - It's been this real mystery about how they figured it out,

497
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:52,240
 re-center of gravity, and generally their massive size.

498
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,280
 And one of the ways that they did it

499
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:55,000
 was by having a very light head.

500
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
 So they had these openings in front of their eyes

501
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,640
 in their skulls called the antorbital fenestra,

502
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:01,880
 which is just the window in front of their eyes.

503
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:03,040
 And we don't really know what was in it,

504
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:06,480
 maybe a gland or muscle, it might've just been a big air cavity.

505
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:09,120
 And this sometimes has huge hole in their skull,

506
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:10,880
 was so big that it could, in some of them,

507
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:13,120
 it could fit their entire torso through it.

508
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:14,720
 Isn't they didn't put their torso through it?

509
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,520
 - If they stopped too fast,

510
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:17,720
 wouldn't it shoot out through it?

511
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:18,560
 - Yes, exactly.

512
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:19,800
 They literally turn inside out.

513
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:23,400
 - Like a jumpy, you have to put back the right way around.

514
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:24,400
 - Yeah, it's amazing.

515
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:27,840
 And also one reason that we know they had very light heads

516
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:29,600
 is because the bones were very light, right?

517
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:30,440
 - Yes.

518
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:32,800
 - But the bones were quite thick in places,

519
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:35,480
 but there was a big gap of air in the middle,

520
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:39,000
 and then the actual edges of the bone were like one millimeter thick.

521
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,880
 And that means it's really hard for us to find

522
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:44,480
 terrasaur fossils because they just kind of wash away

523
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,040
 on the crumbalop.

524
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:48,720
 There's hardly any of them in existence.

525
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:51,800
 I read one article, I don't know if this is true

526
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:54,480
 of all terrasars, but one person said

527
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,760
 you could put all the fossil material of terrasars

528
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:58,960
 that we've ever found in one handbag.

529
00:17:58,960 --> 00:17:59,800
 - No.

530
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:01,560
 - If you were to crush it all up.

531
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:03,120
 And that's because it's so thin,

532
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:06,800
 and so we all had a nice, not that many of them as well.

533
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:09,000
 It could be that they were talking about specific species

534
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,480
 I couldn't quite tell from there.

535
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:11,320
 - You could believe that though.

536
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:12,960
 If you powder ill, put it in a blender.

537
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,840
 - I've seen some big handbags.

538
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:16,560
 - That's why they check your handbags

539
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:18,720
 at the Natural History Museum when you're at it.

540
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:19,720
 - That's why.

541
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:20,880
 - Because it's a terrasaur, isn't it?

542
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:21,840
 - Yeah, it's because we're serras.

543
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,520
 This all of the fossils of terrasars

544
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,320
 we've never found in history in the uphand bag.

545
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:26,320
 - Oh, busted.

546
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:29,160
 - Terrasars, not dinosaurs.

547
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:30,000
 - No.

548
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,360
 - I'm sure everyone around this table knew that,

549
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,760
 but I didn't, so it's worth saying.

550
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:33,600
 - It's weird.

551
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:34,680
 - For the people at home.

552
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:35,600
 Yeah, not dinosaurs.

553
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,760
 - And also, birds didn't descend from them.

554
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:39,440
 Which, again, I think everyone says,

555
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:40,760
 birds descend from dinosaurs.

556
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:42,280
 And you think, why it must be the flying type,

557
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:45,640
 but yeah, not at all birds descended from things

558
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:48,200
 that could not fly when the dinosaurs were around.

559
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,760
 - It's really amazing that, isn't it?

560
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:52,800
 And I read as well that the largest thing

561
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:56,000
 which survived that attack from a meteorite,

562
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,440
 not an attack, it wasn't a meteorite spot.

563
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:59,920
 - It wasn't malicious, you make it sound deliberate.

564
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:01,640
 - It was just flying through the universe

565
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:02,480
 and the earth got in the way.

566
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:03,320
 - Yeah.

567
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:04,160
 - It's not the meteorite spot.

568
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:06,040
 But the largest thing that would have survived

569
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:08,640
 was around 44 pounds.

570
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:11,560
 And that today would be about the size of an American beaver.

571
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:13,880
 So anything bigger than a beaver would die.

572
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:15,520
 Anything smaller than a beaver,

573
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:17,360
 some would die, but some would survive.

574
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:19,720
 And the things that turn into birds

575
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:23,200
 were not just the small dinosaurs weirdly.

576
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:26,280
 It was some of the medium ones that were eating seeds.

577
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:27,120
 - Okay.

578
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:29,280
 - Because when there's like a nuclear winter

579
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:32,200
 because the meteor hits and nothing can grow,

580
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:34,200
 the seeds can still live underground.

581
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:37,200
 And so these little dinosaurs could go and still eat the seeds

582
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,720
 until everything got better.

583
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,200
 And they were the ones that survived.

584
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:41,040
 - Wow.

585
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:42,680
 - And I wonder if that's, I think that's why today

586
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:45,120
 like birds, which are the things that survived

587
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:46,840
 from there are the things that eat seeds.

588
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:49,320
 - Okay, yeah, that's really cool.

589
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:54,000
 One thing that's descended from those guys are woodpeckers.

590
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,160
 - Oh, yeah.

591
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:57,800
 - And those just found them, but what they do with their heads,

592
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:00,840
 they bang their heads into trees at speeds of about 15 miles

593
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:03,680
 an hour up to 12,000 times a day.

594
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:04,520
 - Whoa.

595
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:06,120
 - I mean, what must that be like?

596
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:06,960
 - Yeah.

597
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,160
 - I don't think they get headaches, it's just.

598
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:10,680
 - We found this out for QI ones and it's...

599
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:13,240
 - I never got a weird tongue, haven't they?

600
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:14,080
 - Yeah.

601
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,080
 - They're wrapped around their brains.

602
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:16,080
 - Yeah.

603
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:16,920
 - Yeah.

604
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:19,320
 - I think they got thick skulls or some kind of padding skulls.

605
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:21,320
 - They've got some kind of special brain casing.

606
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:22,160
 - Yeah.

607
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:24,000
 - It's sort of wobbles around in jelly.

608
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,560
 - It is amazing though, isn't it?

609
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:27,600
 - Another head banger is death watch beetles,

610
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,760
 which repeatedly bang their heads on the floor

611
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,080
 to attract mates.

612
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:31,920
 - It's incredible.

613
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,120
 - I tried that, doesn't it?

614
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:33,960
 - Don't work.

615
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:35,480
 - No, no.

616
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:37,000
 - Death watch beetles, that's a metal band.

617
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
 - Death watch beetles.

618
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,040
 - Death watch beetles and a metal tribute beetles bag.

619
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:41,760
 (laughing)

620
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:46,320
 - I've got some, I decided to run a search for four times

621
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,680
 to what things are four times as much as you do.

622
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:49,520
 - Oh yeah.

623
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:50,360
 - Oh yeah, yeah.

624
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:51,840
 - So there's some quite good ones in here.

625
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:54,400
 So spiders milk, but you didn't know there wasn't it,

626
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,440
 but some spiders produce milk.

627
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:59,280
 And spiders milk contains four times as much protein

628
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:00,840
 as cow's milk.

629
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:01,680
 - Oh, one more.

630
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:03,160
 - And they're hard to milk though, aren't they?

631
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:06,200
 I reckon like you get more from a cow's other

632
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:08,360
 than you do from a spider's other.

633
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:09,920
 - Just going to milk the spiders?

634
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:13,040
 I'll be back in two months, when I've got enough.

635
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:17,440
 - So, and chimpanzees expend four times as much energy

636
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:21,280
 walking on either four or two legs than humans do.

637
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,120
 - Wow.

638
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:23,120
 - It's really hard for them walking.

639
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:24,120
 - Wow, I wonder why that is.

640
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:25,160
 - It's awesome, I don't know.

641
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:26,680
 - They've got a huge upper bodies, haven't they?

642
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:28,120
 That must be tiring.

643
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:28,960
 - Yeah.

644
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:32,320
 - The T genome is four times longer than the coffee genome.

645
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:34,600
 So that's discovered by Chinese geneticists.

646
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:36,360
 And this one is astonishing.

647
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:39,320
 Almost four times as many people are murdered

648
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:40,600
 as are killed in wars.

649
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:42,880
 Isn't that a shock?

650
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:43,720
 - Yeah, wow.

651
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:44,560
 - Yeah.

652
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:46,160
 - I mean, some of us would say that been killed

653
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:47,360
 in a war is murder.

654
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:50,360
 - All right, Jeremy Corbyn, okay.

655
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:52,040
 (all laughing)

656
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:52,880
 I'm gonna out.

657
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,560
 (all laughing)

658
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:55,800
 - Well, we've had a lot of guests today,

659
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:57,360
 Jimmy Carter, Jeremy Corbyn.

660
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,480
 (all laughing)

661
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:00,600
 - Actually, on tarot actials,

662
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:02,440
 they wore a bit hairy, some of them.

663
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:05,760
 They had what is called tarot fuzz in,

664
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:08,840
 I found in an email thread that I sort of found

665
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:11,400
 archive between paleontologists.

666
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:13,600
 But yeah, they found hair fibers on some of them.

667
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,160
 And they also think this might be

668
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:17,640
 what helped them be able to fly to do with insulation.

669
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:19,400
 But there was sort of fuzzy or fluffy.

670
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:20,240
 - That's really cool.

671
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,080
 - That's cool.

672
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:21,920
 - It's quite cute.

673
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:23,440
 But not on the wings, I think, just on the bod.

674
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:24,280
 - Just that.

675
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:27,000
 - Fuzzy bod, bat wings.

676
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,040
 - They were also the babies.

677
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:30,520
 You know what they call the baby tarot actal?

678
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:31,360
 Or tarot sore?

679
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:32,680
 - Um, no.

680
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:33,880
 - Flap wings.

681
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:34,720
 - Oh, yeah.

682
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,280
 - Flap wings, nice little word.

683
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:37,640
 And they were, so they were first identified

684
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:39,760
 by a guy called George's Curvier.

685
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:40,920
 - George Curvier?

686
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:41,760
 - George.

687
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,080
 - George.

688
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:45,120
 - George Curvier.

689
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:47,160
 - What stage reading that census did you realize

690
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:48,000
 you were at George?

691
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,080
 - You didn't even call him Gub.

692
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:52,320
 (laughing)

693
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:53,080
 - So.

694
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:54,880
 - Sorry, who was George Curvier then?

695
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:59,880
 - George's Curvier was a, he was a scientist.

696
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:02,440
 And he was the person who discovered,

697
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:07,440
 or firstly identified the flying terrasaur in 1809.

698
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:10,400
 And he said that in 1812, he said

699
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,720
 that they were unlikely, we as humans,

700
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:16,280
 were ever unlikely to find any animal as large as that.

701
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:19,600
 Then 10 years after he died, we discovered dinosaurs.

702
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:22,040
 (laughing)

703
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:23,040
 - Oh, what a shame.

704
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:25,680
 He was the first person to say that they flew.

705
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:28,480
 But the first person to describe them in any way scientifically

706
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,280
 was Cosimo Collini.

707
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:33,160
 And he was most famous for being Voltaire's secretary.

708
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:34,000
 - Yeah.

709
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:34,840
 - So it was.

710
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:35,680
 - It was not cool, isn't it?

711
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,200
 Such a weird two worlds colliding.

712
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,040
 - Yeah.

713
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:38,880
 - Yeah.

714
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,360
 - I wonder where he was secretary,

715
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:44,920
 because Voltaire, just down the road from us in Comic Garden,

716
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:45,760
 he used to live there.

717
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:46,600
 - Oh, Voltaire.

718
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:47,440
 - Yeah.

719
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:48,360
 - I think probably in front of life.

720
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:49,720
 - That's why he lived most of his life.

721
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:50,560
 - Okay, cool.

722
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:53,800
 - I think, you said 1809, I think it was 1801, wasn't it?

723
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:54,640
 - Yeah.

724
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:55,480
 - And it's Curvier.

725
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:57,980
 (laughing)

726
00:23:57,980 --> 00:23:59,680
 - He was also, I mean, not only did he see the baby,

727
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:01,960
 he was also the person who was the foundation

728
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:03,440
 of all Darwin's theories.

729
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:04,960
 He was the person who realized

730
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:07,160
 that animals could become extinct.

731
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:08,720
 - I've one last thing before we move on,

732
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,680
 which is, did you know that there were terraces

733
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:12,280
 in the movie "Citizen Kane"?

734
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:13,360
 (laughing)

735
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:14,200
 - What?

736
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:15,520
 - So this is really worth checking out.

737
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:16,920
 So obviously "Citizen Kane" held up

738
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:19,840
 as one of the greatest movies ever made, Orson Wells.

739
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:22,960
 He had an incredible script, he had an incredible cast,

740
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:25,120
 what he didn't have, was an incredible budget.

741
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:27,360
 So for a lot of the movie, they had to reuse

742
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:28,840
 certain things from other movies.

743
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:30,440
 And there's a scene in the movie, and I've watched it,

744
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:33,480
 where they're at some sort of party that's on a beach.

745
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:35,360
 And in the background to show a sort of

746
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:40,360
 jungly background, they had to borrow footage from King Kong,

747
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:43,240
 or son of King Kong, because they couldn't afford

748
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:44,360
 to do it themselves. - Oh my god.

749
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:45,200
 - Yeah.

750
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:48,120
 So in the background, you see these giant terraces

751
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:49,920
 from the movie. - No way, no way.

752
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:52,160
 - It's a spoiler alert, that's what Rosebud is.

753
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:53,000
 - Yeah.

754
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
 - The name of his pet, "Terrosa".

755
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,400
 (laughing)

756
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:58,000
 (upbeat music)

757
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:02,760
 - Okay, it's time for fact number three,

758
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:04,480
 and that is James.

759
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:07,680
 Okay, my fact this week is that the world's first casino

760
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:10,200
 had a rule that you could only gamble

761
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:12,400
 if you were wearing a tricon hat.

762
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,600
 (laughing)

763
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:17,040
 So, this was in Venice.

764
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:22,040
 It was in 1638, and it was called Il Riddotto,

765
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:24,200
 which means the private room.

766
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:26,640
 And Riddotto was actually a word which was used for

767
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:29,080
 like illegal gambling clubs at the time,

768
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:30,680
 but they closed them all down,

769
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:32,400
 and everyone was very upset about it,

770
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,320
 but they said, "No, don't worry,

771
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:36,160
 "we're gonna make an official one that you can all go to."

772
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:38,720
 So, by the rules, everyone's allowed to go there,

773
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,360
 you're all allowed to gamble here, don't worry,

774
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:42,200
 you'll all be able to still gamble,

775
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,760
 but if you do want to gamble,

776
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:46,760
 you're gonna have to wear a tricon hat and a mask,

777
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:49,480
 and tricon hats a mask, or it's extremely expensive,

778
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:51,520
 and so actually the poor people couldn't do it anymore.

779
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:53,440
 - So these were the kind of mask raid masks

780
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:54,760
 that you would go and they-- - Yes, exactly.

781
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:57,400
 - Really sorts out your poker face problem, doesn't it,

782
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:58,240
 when you're gambling.

783
00:25:58,240 --> 00:25:59,760
 - It's pretty good, it's fine. - It's pretty good mask on.

784
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,440
 How could they have called anything?

785
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:03,600
 - I guess usually they don't cover the lips, do they?

786
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:07,120
 They're sort of-- - So if your tail is a big pal.

787
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:08,440
 - No, if your tail is a big pal.

788
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:10,000
 - Because they normally do say,

789
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,720
 but your tail isn't your eyes.

790
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:12,560
 - Not like-- - Do they?

791
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:14,440
 - Yeah, not pulling faces with your arm.

792
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:16,640
 - But the masks, you can see out of the mask,

793
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,040
 you can still see people's eyes.

794
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:19,120
 - Yeah, you can see, well yeah,

795
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,320
 I didn't know the eyes were the tail.

796
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:21,520
 I've been looking in the wrong bit.

797
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:23,160
 - Love you, look at that, the nose.

798
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:25,880
 There's no one's how to move, it's still there.

799
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:28,320
 - Talking about the casinos in Italy,

800
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:32,240
 in 1963, Sean Connery, I just couldn't believe this fact,

801
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:34,880
 but it's there.

802
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:38,720
 He's successfully backed the number 17 three times running

803
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,600
 at the St. Vincent Casino in Italy.

804
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:42,160
 - Yeah, you heard that, sorry?

805
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:43,520
 - Matt, yeah. - I have heard the story.

806
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:46,840
 I know that to be true in a way,

807
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:50,160
 but it did happen to be that there was a lot of press there.

808
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:51,960
 It was basically a publicity something like that.

809
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:54,360
 - No, you think it was a publicity stunt,

810
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:56,280
 but I like to believe it. - I think it was.

811
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:58,680
 - Yeah. - Although he did, he put it on 17 twice

812
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:00,320
 beforehand and it didn't work, didn't he?

813
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:01,520
 It still seemed like he was like,

814
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:02,760
 "Oh, something's going wrong."

815
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:04,000
 - Oh, no.

816
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,840
 - But yeah, basically most people these days

817
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:07,360
 think it was a publicity stunt,

818
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:10,520
 because it happened to be the week before his movie came out

819
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:13,040
 and he was with all the press and everything like that.

820
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:15,240
 - I saw a bit of footage the other day,

821
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:18,240
 totally unrelated to it, but to this fact,

822
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:20,280
 so it just happened to be watching it.

823
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:22,080
 I'm convinced it must be a publicity stunt,

824
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:24,760
 but I can't see anyone that says it was.

825
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:27,720
 - Muhammad Ali, when he was up against Sunny Liston,

826
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:30,440
 he turned to get the fight and to really get at him.

827
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:32,720
 He kept showing up at his house in a bus

828
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:35,280
 and yelling through a megaphone at three o'clock in the morning,

829
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:37,040
 getting a method that has just infuriating him.

830
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:39,400
 And there's footage of Sunny Liston at a table

831
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:41,240
 in a casino rolling dice.

832
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:43,800
 And Muhammad Ali beside him, just yelling at him,

833
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:46,200
 I'm gonna take you down doing all this Ali stuff.

834
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:49,160
 And just out of nowhere, Sunny Liston pulls a gun

835
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:52,240
 out of his pocket and he fires it at Muhammad Ali.

836
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:53,920
 And you see footage of Ali running out

837
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:55,280
 and everyone freaking out.

838
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:57,720
 And it turns out that the gun only has blanks in it

839
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:00,000
 and he fires a couple of shots into his jacket

840
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,160
 and then just goes back to rolling dice.

841
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:03,520
 And everyone's fine with it.

842
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:04,360
 And it moves on.

843
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:05,720
 He must have crapped himself.

844
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:08,240
 (laughing)

845
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:12,720
 - Found this great line from Stephen Wright about gambling.

846
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:15,000
 In Vegas, I got into a long argument

847
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,800
 with the man at the roulette wheel

848
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:19,440
 over what I considered to be an odd number.

849
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:22,280
 (laughing)

850
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:23,920
 - Do you know that all, you know this,

851
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:25,400
 you all know the fact that all the numbers

852
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:27,400
 on a roulette wheel added up together.

853
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:28,240
 - No.

854
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:29,240
 - They add up to 666, do you know that?

855
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:30,840
 - Yeah, it's a bad sign.

856
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:32,520
 People should know not to enter casinos.

857
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:33,880
 (laughing)

858
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:36,360
 But I actually did some research on roulette

859
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:39,080
 for this series, the R series.

860
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:41,880
 And I was reading into the number zero, quite heavily.

861
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:44,560
 And did you know that zero was banned on roulette tables

862
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:45,480
 in this country?

863
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:48,400
 In the, I think it was the late '60s?

864
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:49,400
 - Fairly.

865
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:50,240
 - Yeah, so.

866
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:53,000
 This way is the odds too much in favor of the casino?

867
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,160
 - Well, it's way the odds in favor of the casino at all,

868
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:56,000
 basically.

869
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,640
 So, like you'll know, if you go to a casino today,

870
00:28:57,640 --> 00:29:00,080
 they all have a zero and they absolutely have to.

871
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:02,280
 Otherwise, a casino wouldn't be able to come off

872
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:04,720
 making money because there are 36 numbers.

873
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:06,680
 And you're given odds of one in 36.

874
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:08,080
 But there's this zero on.

875
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:10,080
 Sometimes there's a double zero or triple zero

876
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:11,760
 if you're really being ripped off.

877
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:14,520
 But yeah, in the '60s, in 1967,

878
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:16,800
 the law laws, like the equivalent of the Supreme Court,

879
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:18,800
 decided that they didn't approve of this.

880
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:21,680
 They thought it was unfair that the casino would have any advantage

881
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:24,000
 and they banned zeros from roulette tables.

882
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:24,840
 - Wow.

883
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:27,160
 - And Scotland, your policeman would go round casinos

884
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:29,640
 and like check for zeros on tables

885
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:31,280
 and then close them down if they had them.

886
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:32,520
 - And how long did that last for?

887
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:33,760
 - It lasted a year.

888
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:35,480
 And then they realized that all casinos were saying,

889
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:37,640
 well, we're not going to do business anymore.

890
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:38,880
 And people like casinos.

891
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:39,720
 - It's so interesting.

892
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:41,400
 - And so they changed that law.

893
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:42,240
 - Amazing.

894
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:45,040
 I was reading a thing that apparently something

895
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:47,160
 that's experienced by quite a few casino goers

896
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:49,680
 if they sit down as a slot machine,

897
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:53,320
 they'll sometimes sit on quite a damp chair.

898
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:56,440
 And that's because very, very dedicated gamblers

899
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:58,480
 who've been playing on a single slot machine for ages

900
00:29:58,480 --> 00:29:59,840
 and know that if they leave,

901
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:01,320
 it might be the next one that wins.

902
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:03,440
 Don't go to the toilet, they're just going their trousers.

903
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:04,640
 It's a big thing.

904
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:08,280
 Sort of urinated urine-covered seats.

905
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:09,840
 There's a big problem in casinos.

906
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:10,680
 - Is it really?

907
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:11,440
 - Yeah, yeah.

908
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:12,280
 It's certainly--

909
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:13,240
 - Well, a big problem.

910
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:15,760
 - Well, I never noticed it when I've been to casinos.

911
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:17,840
 I must say, but I can believe that.

912
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:19,880
 I think they were like adult diapers.

913
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:21,560
 - Well, this is, yeah, there's new products

914
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:24,040
 that have been made specifically for a casino goers.

915
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:28,240
 It's called "Player's Advantage" and the idea is,

916
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:30,960
 it's a diaper that gets you an additional 10 to 12 hours

917
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:32,360
 of continuous play.

918
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:35,200
 So you can put, you know.

919
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:37,680
 - Well, you've got to take a long, hard look at your life

920
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:40,280
 and then when you're buying.

921
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:42,120
 And there's advantage or whatever.

922
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:45,680
 - The roulette wheel, we don't really know who properly

923
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:47,360
 invented the modern one, but a lot of people

924
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:50,600
 think it was Blaze Pascale, who's the mathematician,

925
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:53,560
 who's like the father of probability, really.

926
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:57,000
 And the idea that a lot of places say, I don't know if this is true,

927
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:00,400
 that he was trying to make a perpetual motion machine,

928
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:02,880
 which would make it a really bad game of roulette, wouldn't it?

929
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:03,720
 - Very dull.

930
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:07,280
 - The ball just comes from never, and ever, and ever.

931
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:10,280
 - Well, the diaper would come in handy in that case.

932
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:12,860
 (upbeat music)

933
00:31:12,860 --> 00:31:17,600
 - Okay, it's time for our final fact of the show.

934
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:18,880
 And that is my fact.

935
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:21,880
 My fact this week is to promote his new product,

936
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:25,000
 the inventor of Vaseline, would demonstrate his invention

937
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:29,160
 by dipping his hands in acid and then healing the burn wounds

938
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:30,160
 with the balm.

939
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:32,400
 - Dedicated to his product, I'd buy it after that.

940
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:35,080
 - Yeah, well, how quickly does Vaseline work?

941
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:38,440
 - So this is, okay, so we've mentioned this guy very briefly,

942
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:41,720
 he just got on the podcast, his name is Robert Chesa-Brue,

943
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:42,560
 which does--

944
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:43,560
 - I call him Chisbrue.

945
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:44,960
 - I really wanna call him Chisbrue,

946
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:48,040
 and I googled how to pronounce his name a bunch of times,

947
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:49,760
 and it came up with Chesa-Brue.

948
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:50,760
 - Okay, let's call him Chisbrue.

949
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:51,600
 - Chisbrue is way better.

950
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:56,600
 So yeah, Robert Chisbrue, he patented the balm Vaseline in 1872.

951
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:58,920
 So he had this new invention.

952
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:01,000
 He'd spent 10 years experimenting on himself

953
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,000
 to see that it would work.

954
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,440
 But for the time, it was hard to convince people

955
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:06,040
 that it had any practical use.

956
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:08,560
 So he became one of those traveling salesmen,

957
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:11,360
 and he went to department stores all over New York,

958
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:14,240
 where he would arrive at the location and do a demonstration.

959
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:17,120
 The demonstration consisted of him dipping his hand in acid,

960
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:20,400
 or sometimes holding his hand over an open flame,

961
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:22,880
 burning himself, and then putting the balm on,

962
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:24,640
 and then showing his other hand

963
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:27,200
 that he had done a demonstration on the day before,

964
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:28,400
 and how it had healed it up.

965
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:30,880
 Yeah, so it was one hand at a time.

966
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:32,840
 - Oh, wow, so it was the blue Peter of his day.

967
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:33,680
 - Exactly.

968
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:34,520
 - So he was one I made earlier.

969
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:35,360
 - Yeah, exactly.

970
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:37,920
 - A lot of trust in that demonstration, though, isn't there?

971
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:39,200
 - Yes, yeah.

972
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,720
 - 'Cause it fit, I mean, you're trusting

973
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:42,320
 that he had done that the day before,

974
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:44,520
 and he's not just every single day putting his one

975
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:47,320
 with a hand in it, and so that's it.

976
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:48,840
 I bet it was his left hand always

977
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:50,240
 that he put it in acid, isn't it?

978
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:51,640
 - That's true.

979
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:55,200
 - Yeah, but so he did that and used to travel all over.

980
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:59,240
 It was real frontline salesmanship from Old Cheeseborough.

981
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:01,120
 - He would, he had a horse and cart, didn't he?

982
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:02,640
 And he would give away samples,

983
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,000
 and apparently this is the first time

984
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,240
 people gave away samples of any products.

985
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:07,480
 - Wow, that's a very good one.

986
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:09,320
 - I don't know if that's, it doesn't sound true, does it?

987
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:10,920
 It sounds like someone else must have thought of it,

988
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:12,960
 but this is the first example that we've found.

989
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:15,640
 - So he used to, Chesaborough or Cheeseborough,

990
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:20,320
 whatever his name is, he used to have a distilled

991
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:22,760
 sperm whale oil business, so yeah,

992
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:24,720
 and that started becoming redundant

993
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:27,120
 because the oil industry became huge,

994
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:28,520
 and he was basically going bust,

995
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:32,800
 and he used his very last few dollars to go to Pennsylvania,

996
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:36,360
 and he was going to get a job in the oil industry.

997
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:40,040
 And he noticed all these oil workers were always complaining

998
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:41,280
 about the stuff called Rodwax,

999
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:43,960
 which is a black gunk that glued up the drill heads

1000
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:45,760
 and then came out and cleaned it off.

1001
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:46,960
 And he got curious about this,

1002
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:48,600
 and he took a bucket of it home and he thought,

1003
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:51,280
 because if they got wounds and burns and cuts and things,

1004
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:53,640
 they smeared on it, it seemed to get better.

1005
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:55,680
 I don't think it's got healing qualities, actually,

1006
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:57,560
 but what it does, it keeps the dirt out of it,

1007
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:59,000
 that's one reason it's good for you.

1008
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,720
 - Yeah, and keeps moisture in, doesn't it?

1009
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:01,560
 - He was fascinated by this.

1010
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:04,440
 He took this home and his dad said he spent years and years

1011
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:06,680
 experimenting to turn it from this black goo

1012
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:10,120
 into this very clear, almost translucent balm.

1013
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:13,360
 And did you know he was a Brit?

1014
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:14,200
 - No, I was a Brit.

1015
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:15,040
 - So he was American.

1016
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:17,440
 - No, he worked in America, but he was actually a Brit,

1017
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:19,800
 and Queen Victoria used Vaseline.

1018
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:22,480
 We don't know why, she was a big fan,

1019
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:25,200
 and she actually knighted him in 1883.

1020
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:27,520
 - But unfortunately, the sod slipped off his shell.

1021
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:29,960
 (laughing)

1022
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:31,760
 'Cause he did used to cover himself in it.

1023
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:33,760
 That's the one thing that we mentioned.

1024
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:35,720
 He thought that it was just this amazing thing

1025
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:37,000
 that would cure everything,

1026
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,880
 and he thought there was some special stuff in it

1027
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:40,080
 that would make him better.

1028
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:42,680
 And he got pleuricy and he covered his whole body in it,

1029
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:43,840
 and he did actually get better,

1030
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:45,360
 but probably not 'cause of that.

1031
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:50,360
 - Well, he lived in '96, and he got sick in his late '50s.

1032
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:55,320
 And he hired a private nurse who was instructed

1033
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:58,800
 to rub him down, whole body rubbed down in Vaseline every day.

1034
00:34:58,800 --> 00:34:59,800
 - I can't matter that job.

1035
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:03,200
 - And he had just been full of it, literally every day,

1036
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:06,800
 and he attributed his longevity to exactly that.

1037
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:07,640
 - Yeah.

1038
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:10,000
 - I mean, you would if it's your big business, right?

1039
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,160
 - You would say that.

1040
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:13,960
 - He was secretly taking a lot of sort of morphine

1041
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:15,440
 and aracy to hold.

1042
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:16,280
 (laughing)

1043
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:19,920
 - But I dug out some other uses of Vaseline,

1044
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:20,920
 apart from the obvious.

1045
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:21,760
 - Oh yeah.

1046
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:26,120
 - So it has been smeared on fish hooks to lure trout,

1047
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:28,600
 treat nappy rash, and toenail fungus.

1048
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:30,800
 It's used for staunching nose bleeds,

1049
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:33,000
 removing ring marks from furniture.

1050
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:36,240
 It's dabbed on cheeks by actresses to simulate tears,

1051
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:38,480
 removing makeup, predicting gun barrels,

1052
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:39,960
 shining patent leather shoes,

1053
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:41,560
 lubricating slide rules.

1054
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:43,280
 That's a neat use.

1055
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:44,120
 (laughing)

1056
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:45,760
 - That's a use for this afraid or sex issue.

1057
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:48,520
 (laughing)

1058
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:50,840
 - And then the moustache wax, sunscreen,

1059
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:52,720
 anti-failing for boats.

1060
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:55,160
 It's used by ear, nose, and throat surgeons

1061
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:57,320
 to combat nasal crusting.

1062
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:58,160
 - Ooh!

1063
00:35:58,160 --> 00:35:59,600
 - I don't want to get nasal crusting

1064
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:01,080
 when you're under the knife, do you know?

1065
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:01,920
 (laughing)

1066
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:03,800
 - I like the one I really like is,

1067
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:06,160
 it's supposedly used in boxing before a fight,

1068
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:08,560
 so that a punch doesn't quite land on your face

1069
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:10,400
 and sort of slips off as you are doing.

1070
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:12,440
 - You see them put it on the cheekbones, do you?

1071
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:14,720
 - Yeah, and they're not allowed to do it mid-fight,

1072
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:16,160
 and some people are caught doing it,

1073
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:17,400
 so the coaches will come over

1074
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:19,640
 and subtly Vaseline their face up.

1075
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:22,720
 - In American football, if you're trying to stop

1076
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:24,000
 someone from getting to your quarterback,

1077
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,560
 you're not allowed to hold them, that's a big thing.

1078
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:26,520
 You're allowed to block them,

1079
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:27,360
 but not hold them.

1080
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:28,200
 - Yeah.

1081
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:31,080
 - And so people would put Vaseline on their whole bodies

1082
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:32,640
 so that when you're putting your hands out

1083
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:35,720
 onto the chest to block them, they just slip away from you.

1084
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:36,560
 - Wow.

1085
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:39,120
 - But the defensive people, they kind of go against it

1086
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:42,120
 by putting like drawing pins in their gloves

1087
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:43,840
 and like thumbtacks in their gloves,

1088
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:45,520
 so they can grip on even better.

1089
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:46,960
 - Is that allowed?

1090
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:48,480
 - I don't think it is allowed.

1091
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:49,480
 It doesn't sound allowed,

1092
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:51,120
 but I think people still do it.

1093
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:52,440
 - Wow.

1094
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:54,040
 - There was John, you're a director,

1095
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:55,560
 you've done a lot of advert director.

1096
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:56,400
 - Yeah.

1097
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:58,600
 - So do you know about the fact that it's used as a technique

1098
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:00,720
 to make a sort of soft focus effect?

1099
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:01,560
 - Yes.

1100
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:02,400
 - Yeah.

1101
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:03,960
 - So they smear Vaseline on the lens of a camera.

1102
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:06,720
 - They'd say entry that put some Vaseline on the lens.

1103
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:07,640
 - Yeah, it's extraordinary.

1104
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:10,600
 It's used in a lot of soft core porn.

1105
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:12,360
 - You know, you get that sort of thing where it's like

1106
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:15,400
 a dreamy look around the face, the actress or whatever.

1107
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:16,240
 - You can imagine.

1108
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:17,840
 And I didn't know you had such a strong career

1109
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:19,320
 in the porn industry before.

1110
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:20,480
 - Yes, absolutely.

1111
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:21,320
 (laughing)

1112
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:23,640
 - It was lubricating slide rules before you.

1113
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:26,080
 (laughing)

1114
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:28,880
 - So they use it in Star Trek, for example.

1115
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:32,600
 Any time that Captain Kirk played by William Shatner

1116
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:35,200
 would see a girl that was gonna be the girl of the week

1117
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:36,440
 as it were.

1118
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:38,480
 They would use this soft focus on that girl.

1119
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:40,080
 - So he goes, "Mr. D.R."

1120
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:40,920
 - Yeah.

1121
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:41,760
 - It looks like he's gone, "Mr. D.R."

1122
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:42,600
 - Yeah.

1123
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:44,000
 - So I think I saw a remember that in Star Trek.

1124
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:47,920
 - And Doris Day, the actress used to have in her contract

1125
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:50,720
 that close-ups when she got older all had to be done

1126
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:52,920
 in soft focus because she was too worried

1127
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:55,600
 about her, the lines on her face and so on.

1128
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:56,440
 - Really?

1129
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:58,320
 - Yeah, so there's movies with her in Rock Hudson,

1130
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:00,600
 where Rock Hudson is in clear shot

1131
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:02,400
 as a close-up cut to Doris Day.

1132
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,040
 She's in the street, and it looks really odd.

1133
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:05,000
 - That is so weird.

1134
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,000
 - Yeah.

1135
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,480
 - They also, I just found one use on smearing over glass.

1136
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:12,200
 One use for it related to that, if you're a burglar,

1137
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:14,960
 was uncovered in 2012 when someone went around

1138
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:16,360
 burglaring apartments.

1139
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:18,560
 And people realized that he was doing the same thing

1140
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:20,440
 every apartment he burgled, which was smearing Vaseline

1141
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:22,560
 over the opposite apartment's people.

1142
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:25,480
 So when they looked out of their people, they couldn't see him

1143
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:26,920
 and I don't know why he thought they couldn't open

1144
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:27,760
 their own doors.

1145
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:29,880
 - Or they thought, "Who's that dreamy guy?"

1146
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:31,720
 (all laughing)

1147
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:33,160
 - Burgling that house.

1148
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:35,320
 Harrison Ford would never rob a home.

1149
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:36,640
 (all laughing)

1150
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:38,760
 - And you should mention me in commercials

1151
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:41,200
 and Captain Kirk in the same paragraph.

1152
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:43,400
 Just two of the ads I shot were actually

1153
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:44,440
 with William Chatner.

1154
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:45,280
 - Oh really?

1155
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:47,520
 - Yeah, in LA for Kellogg's, yeah.

1156
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:48,360
 - Really?

1157
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:49,880
 - He was great, he was such a good guy.

1158
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:51,120
 I got really well with him.

1159
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:52,240
 Very, very funny.

1160
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:53,080
 - Really?

1161
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:55,680
 - Did he demand the Vaseline for every shot?

1162
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:56,520
 - No.

1163
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:59,480
 (all laughing)

1164
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:01,680
 - Oh, just one interesting thing about Vaseline,

1165
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:03,920
 something else that it was very important

1166
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:06,080
 in the invention of was mascara.

1167
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:09,480
 So modern mascara was invented when a woman

1168
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:12,680
 called Mabel Williams, this was in 1915,

1169
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:14,760
 she sort of singed her eyebrows and eyelashes

1170
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:16,080
 in a kitchen fire.

1171
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:18,400
 And she wanted to make her eyelashes look longer again.

1172
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:20,160
 And so she came up with this homemade technique

1173
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:23,520
 of mixing ash and coal with Vaseline.

1174
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:27,440
 And then she applied her eyelashes and did the trick.

1175
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:29,800
 Her brother Tom, weirdly watching her,

1176
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:31,720
 watching her, spying on her

1177
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:34,080
 and decided to try and recreate this and commercialize it.

1178
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:35,600
 So he used a friend's chemistry set,

1179
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:38,600
 mixed it all together, made modern mascara

1180
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:40,600
 and named it after her, named it Maybelline.

1181
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:41,440
 - No, that's Maybelline?

1182
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:42,280
 That's your own Maybelline.

1183
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:43,120
 - Maybelline.

1184
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:43,960
 - That's really good.

1185
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:44,800
 That's great.

1186
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:45,880
 - Very cool.

1187
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:50,120
 So speaking of burns, there is one thing

1188
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:52,240
 that's used for treating burns

1189
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:57,240
 and that is poo shakes and that is like a milkshake

1190
00:39:57,240 --> 00:39:59,120
 but it's made with poo.

1191
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:01,120
 And this is in New South Wales

1192
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:04,280
 and it's the Pot Macarie Koala Hospital.

1193
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:06,960
 Obviously they had a lot of fires in Australia recently

1194
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:09,000
 and love the koala's got burned.

1195
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:12,760
 And they found that by feeding them these poo milkshakes,

1196
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:15,560
 the koalas are getting better a lot quicker.

1197
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:19,400
 And it's basically your old gut bacteria thing.

1198
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:22,520
 So when you're a baby koala, you eat pap,

1199
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:25,600
 which is a mixture of digested half digested food

1200
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:28,480
 and bacteria is created in the mother's gut

1201
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:32,520
 and comes out through the seacum and the joey eats it.

1202
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:34,560
 And so what they're doing is they're trying to come up

1203
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:38,960
 with a way of imitating this by making these poo milkshakes

1204
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:40,680
 and they give them to the koalas

1205
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:42,520
 and it just helps them to put on weight.

1206
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:45,200
 It just helps them to get generally better

1207
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:47,240
 and that makes the burns heal more quickly.

1208
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:48,920
 - Okay, because it sort of builds up their immune system

1209
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:50,320
 against the burns.

1210
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:52,080
 - That's treating burns from the inside,

1211
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:53,400
 which is such a cool.

1212
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:54,240
 - Inside out.

1213
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:55,080
 - Yeah.

1214
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:59,240
 - My favourite burns, burns related story is,

1215
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:01,000
 which is in the 1940s.

1216
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,360
 And scientists wanted to come up with a pain scale.

1217
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:05,840
 They wanted to create the pain unit, the dull law.

1218
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:08,560
 And they decided the way they were going to do this,

1219
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:10,200
 where they were going to measure pain

1220
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:13,320
 and work out the scale was by taking women in labor

1221
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:15,640
 and then burning them repeatedly.

1222
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:17,600
 And then asking them to compare the sensation

1223
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:19,280
 of being burned to being in labor.

1224
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:21,480
 And the women were keen to do, they were interested.

1225
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:23,640
 They tended to be the wives of the doctors and the nurses.

1226
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:25,760
 They were like, yeah, fine, I'm gonna be in pain anyway.

1227
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:27,920
 And so they have these women who were in labor

1228
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:28,760
 going through contractions.

1229
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:31,040
 And then they just like burn their finger with a lighter

1230
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:33,880
 and say, how bad is that compared to your contraction?

1231
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:37,080
 And they were gonna be like, yeah, it's about the same.

1232
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:38,120
 And then it got worse and worse.

1233
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:39,520
 And they found they said that the problem was

1234
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:40,720
 that as contractions progressed,

1235
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:42,920
 the women became less good at coherently describing

1236
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:44,320
 their feelings.

1237
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:46,080
 So the researchers had to make inferences

1238
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:48,280
 about their pain based on their behavior.

1239
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:51,040
 So I think when she told me to go fuck myself,

1240
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:53,360
 I'll put that down as a tab.

1241
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:56,600
 [LAUGHTER]

1242
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:58,040
 But that's amazing.

1243
00:41:58,040 --> 00:42:01,240
 Is the idea a bit like how, you know, if you have a splinter

1244
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:03,880
 and then you break your ankle, you forget about the splinter.

1245
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:05,120
 Is it that kind of thing?

1246
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:06,560
 It's not that idea.

1247
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:08,920
 The idea was that they thought that going,

1248
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:10,720
 the peak of labor was maximum pain.

1249
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:12,520
 So that would be max on the scale.

1250
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:14,800
 And then they wanted the women to quantify, be like,

1251
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:18,640
 all that burn is about a tenth as bad as the labor pain I've just felt.

1252
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:22,800
 But women got less and less good at perfectly rationalizing that pain.

1253
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:25,600
 Do you know, before QI was a thing,

1254
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:29,480
 I saw a little email group, six of us, they were in the group.

1255
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:33,640
 And we said this thing called the quite boring challenge.

1256
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:34,360
 Do you know this story?

1257
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:34,960
 No.

1258
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:37,480
 And the idea was one of us would nominate every week

1259
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:40,560
 a subject about which nothing interesting was or could be known.

1260
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:41,320
 OK.

1261
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:43,480
 And I started an I nominated Chumford,

1262
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:45,840
 because I grew up from near Chumford.

1263
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:47,880
 And I spent a week researching Chumford.

1264
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:50,240
 It was a fascinating facts I came up with.

1265
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:57,120
 And one of them is this, is that largest burns unit in Europe is in Chumford, in S6.

1266
00:42:57,120 --> 00:43:01,960
 And for 30 years, the Conservative MP for Chumford was Simon Burns.

1267
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:03,160
 Oh, great.

1268
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:03,680
 OK.

1269
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:05,800
 Yeah, he was knighted in 2015.

1270
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:09,040
 He's the second cousin of David Bowie, of Bizarre.

1271
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:13,280
 But because he was educated at Worcester College, Oxford, where he got a third,

1272
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:16,280
 he's known by his friends as third-degree burns.

1273
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:21,520
 No, it's amazing when those QI facts come together.

1274
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:28,920
 OK, that's it.

1275
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:30,000
 That is all of our facts.

1276
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,400
 Thank you so much for listening.

1280
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:41,400
 Ah, James Harkin.

1281
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:42,080

 Yep.

1284
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:47,040
 And John, you're not on it either.

1285
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:47,640
 I like Anna.

1286
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:48,720
 I'm in social media at all.

1287
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:49,520

 No such thing as a fish.com.

1291
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:00,480
 We have everything up there from all of our previous episodes.

1292
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:04,200
 We have links to our behind-the-scenes documentary.

1293
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:07,760
 And actually, before we go, we're going to play out with a nice little song,

1294
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:11,120
 because, John, you're now at the manager of a band waiting for Smith.

1295
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:11,880
 Yeah.

1296
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:13,360
 And we've got their single here.

1297
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:13,880
 Yeah.

1298
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:14,880
 So I am the manager.

1299
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:16,040
 My name is Brian Ego.

1300
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:18,000
 Lovely boy is very talented.

1301
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:21,080
 And their latest single is called "So Much Love".

1302
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:21,560
 OK.

1303
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:23,280
 Well, we'll see you all again next week.

1304
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:24,720
 And the player's out now.

1305
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:25,680
 It's waiting for Smith.

1306
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:26,920
 We're so much love.
