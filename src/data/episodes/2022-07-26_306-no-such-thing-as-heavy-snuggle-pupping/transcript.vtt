00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.300
 - Hey everybody, welcome to this week's episode of Fish.

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:04.480
 We have a very exciting guest on this week.

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:05.600
 - Yes, is it Andy?

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:06.800
 - It's not Andy.

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:08.680
 Yeah, no, Andy is still a guest.

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:11.080
 We consider him a guest of the show.

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:12.680
 But no, he was busy this week, so.

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:14.520
 - I thought what I was saying is Andy isn't here.

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:16.320
 - Yeah, that's effectively.

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.680
 But I still, I feel the guest thing.

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:23.480
 No, very excitingly, we have the founder of QI, John Lloyd himself.

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:25.480
 He's been on a few times.

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:27.440
 This is the guy who gave us not the nine o'clock news.

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:29.240
 Black Adder, spitting image.

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:32.720
 He helped create Mr. Bean, co-wrote to the original radio episodes

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:34.120
 of Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:37.520
 - Yes, he exact produced a short-lived television show.

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:38.520
 Those things are the news.

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.440
 - Which he says is the highlight of his career.

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:41.840
 I don't know if he means the ending of it

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:45.640
 or the experience itself, but he's now turned himself

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:47.720
 into a music manager.

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:49.960
 The band that he looks after is called Waiting for Smith.

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:52.560
 And if you hang out, listener, to the end of this episode,

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:54.000
 we're actually gonna play a track

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.360
 from Waiting for Smith, their latest singer.

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:57.840
 - You don't have to listen to it all.

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.680
 You can fast forward the whole episode.

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:01.360
 - It just gets straight to the song.

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:04.640
 - No, no, experience the show without our guest Andy

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:09.120
 and see how it feels and give us feedback of what you think.

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:10.760
 Anyway, he was a fantastic guest.

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:12.800
 It's always amazing to get loydy on the show

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:14.440
 and have a listen at the end.

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:15.920
 And yeah, enjoy the show.

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:18.680
 (upbeat music)

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:22.600
 (upbeat music)

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:32.200
 - Hello and welcome to another episode

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:35.000
 of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.440
 coming to you from the QI offices in Covert Garden.

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:39.760
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:43.240
 I am sitting here with James Harkin, Anna Chazinski

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:45.360
 and Chief Nome John Lloyd.

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.640
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.600
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.640
 and in no particular order, here we go.

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.640
 Starting with you, John.

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:59.880
 - Right, my fact is that when the Greek government

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.240
 put a tax on swimming pools in 2008,

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.680
 only 324 Athenians admitted to having one.

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:11.080
 A search by Google Earth Hava revealed the actual number,

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:14.400
 16,974.

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:15.880
 (laughing)

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:16.720
 - It's incredible.

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:18.800
 - It's bare face, isn't it?

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:22.240
 According to the IMF, more than half of all Greek households

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:24.400
 pay no income tax at all.

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:25.240
 - Wow.

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:27.320
 - And Greece has got the largest black market

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:31.840
 in the whole Eurozone, accounting for 21.5% of its GDP.

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.440
 There's a reason for this, I believe.

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:37.240
 I was when I was in Greece last year.

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:38.960
 Somebody explained why this is,

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:41.600
 why the Greeks are so poor at playing their taxes.

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:42.760
 Because for a thousand years,

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:44.360
 they were part of the Ottoman Empire,

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:45.640
 which they absolutely hated.

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:48.480
 And it was considered a patriotic national duty,

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.040
 not to pay your taxes.

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:51.720
 - Well, and they just haven't caught up with the history

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:54.680
 that the Ottoman Empire fell apart a hundred years ago.

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:56.240
 - I think there are some traditions

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:58.000
 that you really want to bring back immediately

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
 and maybe pay in taxes not one of them.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.760
 It has a bit lower down on the list.

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:02.600
 - You're right.

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:03.440
 - I love these pools,

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:05.480
 'cause it feels as if they were prepared

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:07.040
 for this Google Earth search,

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:09.400
 because they all hide them with camouflage.

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:10.360
 - How do you hide a pool?

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:13.560
 - Okay, so they have floating tiles

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:14.880
 that they put on the top of their pool.

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:15.720
 - Very clever.

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:16.880
 - Yep, they have army nets,

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:19.000
 so they camouflage it all together.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.080
 And some even paint the interior of their pools

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:23.280
 to mimic grass.

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:24.120
 - Wow.

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:24.960
 - Wow.

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:25.800
 - Oh, it's brilliant.

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:26.640
 - It's extraordinary.

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:27.880
 - So the first Google Earth search said no swimming pools,

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:29.600
 but an extraordinary number of army nets

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:32.200
 in people's garden with no apparent reason.

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:34.560
 - The Greeks have a really good history of paying taxes,

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:35.800
 'cause in ancient Greek,

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:38.440
 they had a really good system of paying tax.

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:40.560
 And that is that the assembly in Athens

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:44.160
 would pick the richest people to pay tax.

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:46.320
 The top 300 in some cases.

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:49.520
 And they would just say you have to pay for this parade

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:51.720
 and this battleship and this whatever.

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:52.560
 - Really?

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:53.520
 - And they all agreed.

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:56.520
 They even competed to spend as much money as possible,

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:58.360
 because it was a real kind of thing

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:00.920
 where you would get respect from people and gratitude.

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:03.560
 And if you were one of the people who paid tax,

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:06.400
 it really increased your standing in the community.

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:07.760
 And people really liked you for it.

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:09.440
 So everyone wanted to pay tax.

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:10.280
 - Okay.

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:11.640
 - Everyone wanted to be in that 300.

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:13.680
 - I wonder if you got your name stamped on the event

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:16.040
 as well, like the liviest parade.

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:16.880
 - You did?

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:18.320
 Yeah, did you all you paid the more likely

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:19.720
 you were to get your name on something?

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:21.880
 - So this is kind of like those philanthropists who,

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:24.520
 I don't know if you mentioned after Notre Dame burned down,

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:26.960
 the philanthropists who really wanted to donate millions

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:29.040
 and then it turned out they kind of only wanted to do it

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:31.720
 if the bell was renamed, you know,

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:34.520
 the ex-person, your name was Bell.

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:35.360
 - Trump Bell.

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:37.880
 - Yeah, Ikea, wing of Notre Dame.

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:43.800
 They're not the worst taxpayers in the world, the Greeks, though.

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:47.000
 The Chinese, only 2% of Chinese pay any income tax.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.760
 And in Pakistan, it's 1%.

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:51.120
 I mean, you wonder how these countries operate?

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:55.360
 - Especially China, which operates entirely as government, yeah.

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:58.080
 I suppose it's just hard to get into those hard to reach spots,

00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:58.920
 isn't it?

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:00.520
 We've all had that itch on our back.

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:02.400
 It's kind of quite big, guys.

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:05.440
 - I was kind of nervous researching this topic

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:08.320
 'cause my Google searches were like amazing tax dodges

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:11.040
 and we're coming up to the end of the tax year.

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:14.720
 But I found tax dodges quite fun the way the people got--

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:16.000
 - Again, researching them, right?

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.320
 - Resurrecting them, just--

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:18.160
 - Ah!

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:24.080
 - That's my accountant there, Jimmy.

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:27.360
 - Yeah, no, early England tax is like the 1700s.

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:29.520
 So there's so many great ways that people try to get around

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:31.240
 all the taxes that were being thrown at them.

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:34.840
 So there was tax on bricks, for example, in houses.

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:37.160
 So one of the dodges that they used to do was people

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:39.200
 just used to use bigger bricks.

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:40.040
 So you use less brick.

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:40.880
 - Oh, really?

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:41.720
 - Perhaps, yeah.

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:43.760
 - Yeah, I did, you could just use four bricks, one for each wall.

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:46.880
 - Exactly, and then they call onto that.

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:50.480
 So they eventually taxed big bricks as well.

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:53.000
 - Did it, by the way, that's actually a bit like with cheese.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.200
 You know the origin of big cheese wheels is based on the fact

00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:58.360
 that cheese used to be taxed by number of cheeses

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:00.280
 in Switzerland, rather than by weight.

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:03.120
 And so people would just make bigger and bigger giant cheeses.

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:04.120
 And that's why we have them.

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:07.640
 And now the average emmental is three feet diameter

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:09.200
 and weighs 220 pounds.

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:11.120
 And uses one and a half tons of milk

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:12.960
 'cause it just gets the same amount of taxes.

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:13.800
 And many one.

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:14.880
 - That's a mini baby bell.

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:15.720
 - And baby bell?

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:16.880
 - Yeah.

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:19.280
 - I was just looking at the quite famous case,

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:21.160
 the jaffa cake case on tax.

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:23.120
 So you know, there's always this debate over where

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:25.680
 the cake, the cakes or biscuits debate.

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:27.600
 And that originates in 1991.

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:30.720
 I think it was, and it's because cakes are traditionally

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:32.520
 in a lot of countries actually are not subject

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:35.520
 to VAT sales tax, whereas biscuits with chocolate on our

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:37.280
 'cause cakes were seen as a necessity

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:38.120
 'cause it used to be, you know,

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:40.000
 your working household would make a cake.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.720
 But yeah, in 1991, McVitties insisted jaffa cake was a cake.

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:46.400
 And so they agreed it had biscuit tendencies,

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:49.600
 but then had to argue overall that it had more cake elements.

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:51.360
 And as part of the, like in court,

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:53.680
 as part of the evidence for the fact that it was a cake,

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:57.320
 McVitties baked a one foot diameter jaffa cake

00:06:57.320 --> 00:06:59.200
 to show this is actually a cake.

00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:00.600
 And the courts can cut.

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:02.240
 And it's been a cake ever since.

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:03.080
 - That's not cool.

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:03.920
 - Yeah, it's amazing.

00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:05.240
 - Do you know the difference in cakes and biscuits?

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:06.080
 How you tell?

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:06.920
 - How you tell?

00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:09.520
 - Because when they go stale, biscuits go soft

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:10.600
 and cakes go hard.

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:11.600
 - Yeah.

00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:12.600
 - Oh, that's cool.

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:14.280
 - But they didn't have the time to sit in the court

00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:18.200
 for sort of three weeks, watching the jaffa cake go stale.

00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:20.520
 This is also actually the case with gingerbread men.

00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:22.600
 So a gingerbread man counts as a cake

00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:25.360
 and counts as a biscuit that's exempt from tax

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:26.840
 'cause it's got no chocolate on it.

00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:29.320
 Until it has a certain amount of chocolate.

00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:31.640
 So if you've got a gingerbread man just with eyes,

00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:34.080
 but naked, no tax on it.

00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:37.200
 But then it'll cost 20% more if it's got one button.

00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:38.040
 - No.

00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:39.280
 (laughing)

00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:40.680
 - One button on its shirt.

00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:43.000
 - Who in their right mind is adding that one button?

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:44.000
 - No, I don't know.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:45.200
 These people are missing a trick.

00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:48.640
 - It's odd that the people who are best at paying taxes

00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:50.040
 are Americans strangely enough.

00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:50.880
 - Oh yeah.

00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:51.720
 - That's slightly surprising.

00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:55.000
 81 to 84% of Americans don't cheat on their taxes

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.280
 compared to 68% of Germans and 62% of Italians.

00:07:58.280 --> 00:07:59.880
 - Are these self-reported figures?

00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:01.720
 (laughing)

00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:04.720
 - But it did really shocking actually how much

00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:08.840
 tax avoidance goes on, not just Apple and Amazon.

00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:12.000
 Amazon has not paid any federal taxes in America

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.200
 even though it makes profits of billions.

00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:19.440
 And there's $8.7 trillion worth of the world's wealth

00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:21.760
 hidden away in tax havens by the rich.

00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:23.120
 That has a lot of money.

00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:25.200
 - Isn't it something like the fifth biggest country

00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:28.200
 in the world if it was a country, isn't it?

00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:32.240
 Something like that, I think, for the biggest in terms of income.

00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:35.280
 The tax haven country, whatever we're calling that.

00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:37.040
 - Where does that sounds great?

00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:38.040
 (laughing)

00:08:38.040 --> 00:08:38.880
 We know where it is.

00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:39.720
 - It's very wealthy.

00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:40.880
 It's wherever you want it to be, Dad.

00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:43.440
 - The UK is king of tax havens.

00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:45.280
 I mean, we don't have anyone else in the world.

00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:46.120
 - Yeah, exactly.

00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:47.640
 We talk about Greece and whoever,

00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:50.840
 but British, the Cayman Islands belongs to Britain,

00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:52.520
 the Virgin Islands belongs to Britain.

00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:53.360
 - Bermuda.

00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:54.200
 - Bermuda, yeah.

00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:55.000
 - I love man.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:55.840
 - Yeah.

00:08:55.840 --> 00:08:58.120
 - The Virgin Islands goes on on. - The Virgin Islands.

00:08:58.120 --> 00:08:59.960
 - The Virgin Islands. - The Virgin Islands.

00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:01.320
 - Did you realise you were taxis then?

00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:03.280
 - No, we're a bit like those villages in China.

00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:05.720
 It's very difficult for the tax ones to get down to Bolton.

00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:07.520
 - Tough itch to scratch, Bolton.

00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:10.400
 - So one of those honest Americans is Warren Buffett,

00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:13.200
 who's been paying income tax since he was 14.

00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:14.040
 - Wow.

00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:15.440
 - He had a paper round.

00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:20.440
 And in 1944, he paid tax of $7 on an income of $592,

00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:24.080
 which would be equivalent to about 8,000 pounds today.

00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:26.480
 He had a pretty enterprising 14-year-old.

00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:28.000
 - That's a lot of newspapers, isn't it?

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:32.400
 - Yeah, another guy who paid £7 tax was the

00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:34.400
 longest-serving Prime Minister of Pakistan.

00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:37.120
 He was a guy called Noah's Sharif,

00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:40.240
 who was in office for nine years on three separate occasions.

00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:43.960
 At one point, he had a personal fortune of two billion pounds,

00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:45.360
 but over a period of several years,

00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:47.200
 paid only just seven pounds into tax.

00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:48.040
 - Wow, the same one.

00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:49.440
 - My wife and he bothers Bermuda.

00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:51.080
 It's like, yeah, this is it.

00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:53.000
 I'm fessing up here.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:54.520
 - It's your full seven-quid bag.

00:09:54.520 --> 00:09:56.520
 (all laughing)

00:09:56.520 --> 00:09:58.840
 - Shall we say something to stuff on swimming pools?

00:09:58.840 --> 00:09:59.680
 - Yeah, sure.

00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:00.680
 - Let's do that.

00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:05.080
 So, do you know, name something that you're not allowed

00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:07.240
 to do with a swimming pool?

00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:09.360
 - You already have a poo.

00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:12.080
 - Oh my, are there any signs on the walls

00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:13.560
 to say you can't do that?

00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:16.680
 - No, that's true, which is why I always challenge them.

00:10:16.680 --> 00:10:17.680
 (all laughing)

00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:18.520
 - On the attempt to kick me out.

00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:20.320
 - Okay, Dave, something that's explicitly told you

00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:23.080
 that's allowed to do on the wall, - Oh, petting.

00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:25.200
 - Petting, that's why I'm saying that.

00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:26.040
 - Not allowed?

00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:27.360
 - I mean, who uses that word anymore?

00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:30.800
 - Right, so why do they call it heavy petting

00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:32.160
 in these swimming pools?

00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:33.000
 - Yeah.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.600
 - Because surely it's just snogging or kissing or whatever,

00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:36.440
 right?

00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:38.720
 Well, the reason is, in the 1920s in America,

00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:41.920
 they had some things called petting parties,

00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:44.640
 and high school students would go to swimming pools,

00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:46.600
 and they would kind of kiss and cuddle and whatever.

00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:47.720
 They would never have sex in there,

00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:50.400
 but they would be getting very close.

00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:53.200
 And people disapproved, and so they would have signs

00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:55.440
 saying no petting on the swimming pools,

00:10:55.440 --> 00:10:59.120
 and that has kind of kept over for almost 100 years now,

00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:00.920
 and you still get heavy petting.

00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:01.760
 - Really?

00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:03.400
 - Signs even though you don't have these parties anymore.

00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:05.480
 - But you might have them if they took the signs away.

00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:06.640
 - I'm not saying, yeah.

00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:08.760
 - So, is that what a petting zoo is?

00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:10.120
 (all laughing)

00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:12.280
 - It is, I had a traumatic childhood, actually,

00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:14.200
 repeatedly taken to those places.

00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:15.200
 (all laughing)

00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:16.400
 - To a heavy petting zoo.

00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:17.800
 (all laughing)

00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:19.440
 They were also these petting parties.

00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:21.520
 They were also known as necking parties,

00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:24.080
 mushing parties, fussing parties,

00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:26.080
 and snuggle-pupping parties.

00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:27.080
 - Snuggle-pupping.

00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:28.840
 - So, I really think it should sell the swimming pool.

00:11:28.840 --> 00:11:30.040
 No snuggle-puppings.

00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:31.240
 - No snuggle-puppings.

00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:32.080
 - Which they won't be,

00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:33.400
 'cause everyone will feel too sick

00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:35.760
 to pet anyone at the phrase snuggle-pupping.

00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:39.280
 - Because there are no signs actually saying no urinating.

00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:40.240
 (all laughing)

00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:43.520
 Public swimming pools contain up to 20 gallons of urine.

00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:44.360
 - Down.

00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:45.840
 - Enough to fill a dustbin.

00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:47.720
 - And the proportion in hotel jacuzzi

00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:49.720
 is up to three times worse.

00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:50.720
 - Wow.

00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:52.320
 - Why are people doing it more in a jacuzzi?

00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:54.680
 - I think it's the bubbles that you want to go, don't they?

00:11:54.680 --> 00:11:55.520
 - Do you think?

00:11:55.520 --> 00:11:56.800
 - Well, I think someone knows.

00:11:56.800 --> 00:11:58.840
 (all laughing)

00:11:58.840 --> 00:12:00.840
 - That study where they found out there was,

00:12:00.840 --> 00:12:02.920
 do you say 20 gallons of urine?

00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:03.760
 - Yes.

00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:05.280
 - It was really clever how they did it,

00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:06.720
 because it's quite difficult to work out

00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:08.880
 how much urine there is in a swimming pool,

00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:10.520
 'cause often the chlorine would change it

00:12:10.520 --> 00:12:12.480
 into other compounds or whatever.

00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:13.960
 But they found a compound in urine

00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:16.080
 that doesn't react with any other chemicals.

00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:19.200
 And that is called acesulfane potassium.

00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:22.240
 And it's a sweetener that you get in lots of like diet drinks

00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:23.080
 - Oh yeah.

00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:26.000
 - And if you urinate that into a swimming pool,

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:27.920
 nothing can get rid of it, so it'll stay there.

00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:29.840
 And so they could take in the amount of water

00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:31.200
 and see how much of that was in,

00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:33.960
 and then work out the 20 gallons of urine from that.

00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:36.840
 - Hang on, are we all urinating this sweetener?

00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:39.240
 - I think they took an average of how much people would.

00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:41.640
 It's in a lot of foods, it's not just in soft drinks,

00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:42.680
 it's in a lot of stuff.

00:12:42.680 --> 00:12:46.120
 And that 20 gallons as well as being a dustbin,

00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:51.120
 it's approximately 121 bottles worth of urine in the swimming pool.

00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:52.560
 - In each swimming pool.

00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:54.160
 - And they sell it in Aldi, don't they?

00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:56.320
 (laughing)

00:12:56.320 --> 00:12:57.160
 That's a terrible slam.

00:12:57.160 --> 00:12:58.920
 Aldi has a really good wine selection, genuinely.

00:12:58.920 --> 00:12:59.760
 - They do, they do, they do.

00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:00.600
 - I'm sorry.

00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:01.440
 - They win Aldi Awards.

00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:03.840
 - Did you know this thing, another thing they could use,

00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:05.960
 and I think they do in some places,

00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:07.240
 silver has got the curious,

00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:09.320
 property of sterilizing water.

00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:11.960
 So they could use silver instead of chlorine.

00:13:11.960 --> 00:13:13.400
 - And only more expensive, though,

00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:15.000
 but you know, only tiny amounts,

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:18.040
 you need only 10 parts per billion.

00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:18.880
 - Wow, 10.

00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:20.160
 - And it's completely safe.

00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:21.000
 - That's great.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:22.800
 So in the Olympics, whoever comes second

00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:25.000
 could jump in the pool out of the race

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:26.680
 and then clean the pool for the next race.

00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:27.520
 - Yes.

00:13:27.520 --> 00:13:29.120
 (laughing)

00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:30.240
 - That's really good.

00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:32.480
 - You know, when you smell that really strong smell

00:13:32.480 --> 00:13:33.480
 of chlorine in a pool.

00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:34.320
 - Yeah, I like it actually.

00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:37.040
 - And you think, okay, and you get high off it maybe,

00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:39.400
 or you think there's too much chlorine in this pool.

00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:41.080
 Do you know what the problem actually is?

00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:44.080
 - My nose is too sad to serve.

00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:44.920
 (laughing)

00:13:44.920 --> 00:13:46.440
 - No, it's that there's not enough chlorine.

00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:47.280
 - Oh, yeah.

00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:48.560
 - So this is, I actually learned this from Dr. Colbert,

00:13:48.560 --> 00:13:49.560
 this in one of his books,

00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:52.080
 but if it smells too strongly of chlorine,

00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:53.560
 it means they haven't put enough in,

00:13:53.560 --> 00:13:54.800
 'cause the smell that you're smelling,

00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:58.000
 it's actually when the chlorine reacts with the nitrogen

00:13:58.000 --> 00:13:59.720
 from things like urine and sweat

00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:01.920
 and dead insects and bacteria and stuff.

00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:02.760
 It combines with it,

00:14:02.760 --> 00:14:05.240
 and it makes these chemicals called chloramines.

00:14:05.240 --> 00:14:07.520
 And the smell comes from this particular chemical

00:14:07.520 --> 00:14:09.000
 called tri-chloramine.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:10.920
 So that's very volatile, so you start smelling it.

00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:12.160
 If you add more chlorine,

00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:13.160
 then it keeps reacting,

00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:14.880
 and it moves on through the chemical process

00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:16.200
 and the tri-chloramine goes away.

00:14:16.200 --> 00:14:17.040
 - That's incredible.

00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:17.880
 - That's amazing.

00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:18.800
 - The smell that I really like

00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:20.680
 is actually dead insects and urine.

00:14:20.680 --> 00:14:22.520
 - That's correct, yes.

00:14:22.520 --> 00:14:23.840
 That seems true to form, no?

00:14:23.840 --> 00:14:26.000
 (laughing)

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:27.640
 - Did you know that Clint Eastwood

00:14:27.640 --> 00:14:29.400
 used to dig swimming pools for a living?

00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:30.560
 - I think that was easy.

00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:32.600
 - Or was he a very enthusiastic grave digger?

00:14:32.600 --> 00:14:34.120
 (laughing)

00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:35.560
 He was quite successful, quite young,

00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:37.440
 and he was sacked by Universal Studios

00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:39.400
 because his Adam's apple was too big.

00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:40.240
 - What?

00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:41.080
 - What are you talking about?

00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:42.240
 - What do you mean?

00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:43.080
 (laughing)

00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:44.560
 - You're testing this now, aren't you?

00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:45.840
 That can't be true.

00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:47.320
 - Well, it is true.

00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:51.360
 It was on IMDB and on www.clinyswood.net.

00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:52.200
 - Oh, there you go.

00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:55.240
 - Where I also found the fact that his name is an anagram

00:14:55.240 --> 00:14:56.680
 of Old West Action.

00:14:56.680 --> 00:14:57.520
 That's quite good.

00:14:57.520 --> 00:14:58.840
 - That's really good.

00:14:58.840 --> 00:15:00.520
 - Wow.

00:15:00.520 --> 00:15:02.240
 Actually, I'm now thinking of Clint Eastwood,

00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:04.160
 and he has big Adam's apple.

00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:05.000
 - You can picture it.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.320
 - Big enough to stop him from digging holes.

00:15:07.320 --> 00:15:09.360
 - No, he wasn't sacked from the grave digging.

00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:11.280
 - I don't know, he was sacked from the movies.

00:15:11.280 --> 00:15:12.520
 - Oh, right.

00:15:12.520 --> 00:15:14.240
 - And then he had to get another job.

00:15:14.240 --> 00:15:16.480
 - You're gonna scare the mourners.

00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:18.240
 - It was swimming pools, it wasn't graves.

00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:19.080
 - He was so working.

00:15:19.080 --> 00:15:21.080
 - When did the Adam's apple thing come in?

00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:21.920
 - I'm sorry, I've lost it.

00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:22.760
 - In the '50s.

00:15:22.760 --> 00:15:24.800
 He was fired by Universal.

00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:26.600
 - That was at the start of his career all the time.

00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:29.760
 - Yeah, he'd been in a couple of sort of B movies,

00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:32.400
 and then the Adam's apple, they suddenly noticed,

00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:34.720
 "Hey, that guy there."

00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:37.120
 Oh my God, it was horrible.

00:15:37.120 --> 00:15:39.400
 - It was when they started having 3D movies, didn't it,

00:15:39.400 --> 00:15:41.400
 and people thought it was going to pop up in the eye.

00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:43.720
 (laughing)

00:15:43.720 --> 00:15:46.320
 (upbeat music)

00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:50.880
 - Okay, it's time for fact number two,

00:15:50.880 --> 00:15:52.480
 and that is Chazinski.

00:15:52.480 --> 00:15:55.280
 - My fact this week is that some terraces had heads

00:15:55.280 --> 00:15:58.640
 that were more than four times the length of their bodies.

00:15:58.640 --> 00:15:59.800
 - No.

00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:01.400
 - How big was that Adam's apple?

00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:03.480
 (laughing)

00:16:03.480 --> 00:16:05.840
 - They were such stupid looking creatures.

00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:09.520
 - So the terraces were tarot dactyl,

00:16:09.520 --> 00:16:12.360
 as often used as kind of a word for the tarot dactyl,

00:16:12.360 --> 00:16:13.480
 tarot dactyl actually not a thing,

00:16:13.480 --> 00:16:16.920
 the tarot dactyl lus was a type of tarot saw.

00:16:16.920 --> 00:16:20.360
 But yeah, they were the first flying species,

00:16:20.360 --> 00:16:23.000
 and they started off about 250 million years ago

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:24.680
 with heads nearly as long as their bodies,

00:16:24.680 --> 00:16:26.800
 and they just extended and extended

00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:30.720
 until you got some terraces like the Ketsal coactless,

00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:33.360
 where the heads and the necks were at least triple

00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:37.120
 the length of the torso, so it took up over 75% of their bodies.

00:16:37.120 --> 00:16:39.320
 - It feels like if you're a flying animal,

00:16:39.320 --> 00:16:41.440
 having a massive head that's three times

00:16:41.440 --> 00:16:43.440
 big with everything else is probably going to be a problem.

00:16:43.440 --> 00:16:45.200
 - You just tip them out the sky all the time.

00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:46.040
 - You think so, right?

00:16:46.040 --> 00:16:48.440
 - It's been this real mystery about how they figured it out,

00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:52.240
 re-center of gravity, and generally their massive size.

00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:53.280
 And one of the ways that they did it

00:16:53.280 --> 00:16:55.000
 was by having a very light head.

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.000
 So they had these openings in front of their eyes

00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:59.640
 in their skulls called the antorbital fenestra,

00:16:59.640 --> 00:17:01.880
 which is just the window in front of their eyes.

00:17:01.880 --> 00:17:03.040
 And we don't really know what was in it,

00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:06.480
 maybe a gland or muscle, it might've just been a big air cavity.

00:17:06.480 --> 00:17:09.120
 And this sometimes has huge hole in their skull,

00:17:09.120 --> 00:17:10.880
 was so big that it could, in some of them,

00:17:10.880 --> 00:17:13.120
 it could fit their entire torso through it.

00:17:13.120 --> 00:17:14.720
 Isn't they didn't put their torso through it?

00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:16.520
 - If they stopped too fast,

00:17:16.520 --> 00:17:17.720
 wouldn't it shoot out through it?

00:17:17.720 --> 00:17:18.560
 - Yes, exactly.

00:17:18.560 --> 00:17:19.800
 They literally turn inside out.

00:17:19.800 --> 00:17:23.400
 - Like a jumpy, you have to put back the right way around.

00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:24.400
 - Yeah, it's amazing.

00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:27.840
 And also one reason that we know they had very light heads

00:17:27.840 --> 00:17:29.600
 is because the bones were very light, right?

00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:30.440
 - Yes.

00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:32.800
 - But the bones were quite thick in places,

00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:35.480
 but there was a big gap of air in the middle,

00:17:35.480 --> 00:17:39.000
 and then the actual edges of the bone were like one millimeter thick.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:40.880
 And that means it's really hard for us to find

00:17:40.880 --> 00:17:44.480
 terrasaur fossils because they just kind of wash away

00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:46.040
 on the crumbalop.

00:17:46.040 --> 00:17:48.720
 There's hardly any of them in existence.

00:17:48.720 --> 00:17:51.800
 I read one article, I don't know if this is true

00:17:51.800 --> 00:17:54.480
 of all terrasars, but one person said

00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:56.760
 you could put all the fossil material of terrasars

00:17:56.760 --> 00:17:58.960
 that we've ever found in one handbag.

00:17:58.960 --> 00:17:59.800
 - No.

00:17:59.800 --> 00:18:01.560
 - If you were to crush it all up.

00:18:01.560 --> 00:18:03.120
 And that's because it's so thin,

00:18:03.120 --> 00:18:06.800
 and so we all had a nice, not that many of them as well.

00:18:06.800 --> 00:18:09.000
 It could be that they were talking about specific species

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:10.480
 I couldn't quite tell from there.

00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:11.320
 - You could believe that though.

00:18:11.320 --> 00:18:12.960
 If you powder ill, put it in a blender.

00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:14.840
 - I've seen some big handbags.

00:18:14.840 --> 00:18:16.560
 - That's why they check your handbags

00:18:16.560 --> 00:18:18.720
 at the Natural History Museum when you're at it.

00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:19.720
 - That's why.

00:18:19.720 --> 00:18:20.880
 - Because it's a terrasaur, isn't it?

00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:21.840
 - Yeah, it's because we're serras.

00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:23.520
 This all of the fossils of terrasars

00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:25.320
 we've never found in history in the uphand bag.

00:18:25.320 --> 00:18:26.320
 - Oh, busted.

00:18:27.320 --> 00:18:29.160
 - Terrasars, not dinosaurs.

00:18:29.160 --> 00:18:30.000
 - No.

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:31.360
 - I'm sure everyone around this table knew that,

00:18:31.360 --> 00:18:32.760
 but I didn't, so it's worth saying.

00:18:32.760 --> 00:18:33.600
 - It's weird.

00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:34.680
 - For the people at home.

00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:35.600
 Yeah, not dinosaurs.

00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:37.760
 - And also, birds didn't descend from them.

00:18:37.760 --> 00:18:39.440
 Which, again, I think everyone says,

00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:40.760
 birds descend from dinosaurs.

00:18:40.760 --> 00:18:42.280
 And you think, why it must be the flying type,

00:18:42.280 --> 00:18:45.640
 but yeah, not at all birds descended from things

00:18:45.640 --> 00:18:48.200
 that could not fly when the dinosaurs were around.

00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:49.760
 - It's really amazing that, isn't it?

00:18:49.760 --> 00:18:52.800
 And I read as well that the largest thing

00:18:52.800 --> 00:18:56.000
 which survived that attack from a meteorite,

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:57.440
 not an attack, it wasn't a meteorite spot.

00:18:57.440 --> 00:18:59.920
 - It wasn't malicious, you make it sound deliberate.

00:18:59.920 --> 00:19:01.640
 - It was just flying through the universe

00:19:01.640 --> 00:19:02.480
 and the earth got in the way.

00:19:02.480 --> 00:19:03.320
 - Yeah.

00:19:03.320 --> 00:19:04.160
 - It's not the meteorite spot.

00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:06.040
 But the largest thing that would have survived

00:19:06.040 --> 00:19:08.640
 was around 44 pounds.

00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:11.560
 And that today would be about the size of an American beaver.

00:19:11.560 --> 00:19:13.880
 So anything bigger than a beaver would die.

00:19:13.880 --> 00:19:15.520
 Anything smaller than a beaver,

00:19:15.520 --> 00:19:17.360
 some would die, but some would survive.

00:19:17.360 --> 00:19:19.720
 And the things that turn into birds

00:19:19.720 --> 00:19:23.200
 were not just the small dinosaurs weirdly.

00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:26.280
 It was some of the medium ones that were eating seeds.

00:19:26.280 --> 00:19:27.120
 - Okay.

00:19:27.120 --> 00:19:29.280
 - Because when there's like a nuclear winter

00:19:29.280 --> 00:19:32.200
 because the meteor hits and nothing can grow,

00:19:32.200 --> 00:19:34.200
 the seeds can still live underground.

00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:37.200
 And so these little dinosaurs could go and still eat the seeds

00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:38.720
 until everything got better.

00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:40.200
 And they were the ones that survived.

00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:41.040
 - Wow.

00:19:41.040 --> 00:19:42.680
 - And I wonder if that's, I think that's why today

00:19:42.680 --> 00:19:45.120
 like birds, which are the things that survived

00:19:45.120 --> 00:19:46.840
 from there are the things that eat seeds.

00:19:46.840 --> 00:19:49.320
 - Okay, yeah, that's really cool.

00:19:49.320 --> 00:19:54.000
 One thing that's descended from those guys are woodpeckers.

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:55.160
 - Oh, yeah.

00:19:55.160 --> 00:19:57.800
 - And those just found them, but what they do with their heads,

00:19:57.800 --> 00:20:00.840
 they bang their heads into trees at speeds of about 15 miles

00:20:00.840 --> 00:20:03.680
 an hour up to 12,000 times a day.

00:20:03.680 --> 00:20:04.520
 - Whoa.

00:20:04.520 --> 00:20:06.120
 - I mean, what must that be like?

00:20:06.120 --> 00:20:06.960
 - Yeah.

00:20:06.960 --> 00:20:08.160
 - I don't think they get headaches, it's just.

00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:10.680
 - We found this out for QI ones and it's...

00:20:10.680 --> 00:20:13.240
 - I never got a weird tongue, haven't they?

00:20:13.240 --> 00:20:14.080
 - Yeah.

00:20:14.080 --> 00:20:15.080
 - They're wrapped around their brains.

00:20:15.080 --> 00:20:16.080
 - Yeah.

00:20:16.080 --> 00:20:16.920
 - Yeah.

00:20:16.920 --> 00:20:19.320
 - I think they got thick skulls or some kind of padding skulls.

00:20:19.320 --> 00:20:21.320
 - They've got some kind of special brain casing.

00:20:21.320 --> 00:20:22.160
 - Yeah.

00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:24.000
 - It's sort of wobbles around in jelly.

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:25.560
 - It is amazing though, isn't it?

00:20:25.560 --> 00:20:27.600
 - Another head banger is death watch beetles,

00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:29.760
 which repeatedly bang their heads on the floor

00:20:29.760 --> 00:20:31.080
 to attract mates.

00:20:31.080 --> 00:20:31.920
 - It's incredible.

00:20:31.920 --> 00:20:33.120
 - I tried that, doesn't it?

00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:33.960
 - Don't work.

00:20:33.960 --> 00:20:35.480
 - No, no.

00:20:35.480 --> 00:20:37.000
 - Death watch beetles, that's a metal band.

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:38.000
 - Death watch beetles.

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:40.040
 - Death watch beetles and a metal tribute beetles bag.

00:20:40.040 --> 00:20:41.760
 (laughing)

00:20:41.760 --> 00:20:46.320
 - I've got some, I decided to run a search for four times

00:20:46.320 --> 00:20:48.680
 to what things are four times as much as you do.

00:20:48.680 --> 00:20:49.520
 - Oh yeah.

00:20:49.520 --> 00:20:50.360
 - Oh yeah, yeah.

00:20:50.360 --> 00:20:51.840
 - So there's some quite good ones in here.

00:20:51.840 --> 00:20:54.400
 So spiders milk, but you didn't know there wasn't it,

00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:56.440
 but some spiders produce milk.

00:20:56.440 --> 00:20:59.280
 And spiders milk contains four times as much protein

00:20:59.280 --> 00:21:00.840
 as cow's milk.

00:21:00.840 --> 00:21:01.680
 - Oh, one more.

00:21:01.680 --> 00:21:03.160
 - And they're hard to milk though, aren't they?

00:21:03.160 --> 00:21:06.200
 I reckon like you get more from a cow's other

00:21:06.200 --> 00:21:08.360
 than you do from a spider's other.

00:21:08.360 --> 00:21:09.920
 - Just going to milk the spiders?

00:21:09.920 --> 00:21:13.040
 I'll be back in two months, when I've got enough.

00:21:13.040 --> 00:21:17.440
 - So, and chimpanzees expend four times as much energy

00:21:17.440 --> 00:21:21.280
 walking on either four or two legs than humans do.

00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:22.120
 - Wow.

00:21:22.120 --> 00:21:23.120
 - It's really hard for them walking.

00:21:23.120 --> 00:21:24.120
 - Wow, I wonder why that is.

00:21:24.120 --> 00:21:25.160
 - It's awesome, I don't know.

00:21:25.160 --> 00:21:26.680
 - They've got a huge upper bodies, haven't they?

00:21:26.680 --> 00:21:28.120
 That must be tiring.

00:21:28.120 --> 00:21:28.960
 - Yeah.

00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:32.320
 - The T genome is four times longer than the coffee genome.

00:21:32.320 --> 00:21:34.600
 So that's discovered by Chinese geneticists.

00:21:34.600 --> 00:21:36.360
 And this one is astonishing.

00:21:36.360 --> 00:21:39.320
 Almost four times as many people are murdered

00:21:39.320 --> 00:21:40.600
 as are killed in wars.

00:21:40.600 --> 00:21:42.880
 Isn't that a shock?

00:21:42.880 --> 00:21:43.720
 - Yeah, wow.

00:21:43.720 --> 00:21:44.560
 - Yeah.

00:21:44.560 --> 00:21:46.160
 - I mean, some of us would say that been killed

00:21:46.160 --> 00:21:47.360
 in a war is murder.

00:21:47.360 --> 00:21:50.360
 - All right, Jeremy Corbyn, okay.

00:21:50.360 --> 00:21:52.040
 (all laughing)

00:21:52.040 --> 00:21:52.880
 I'm gonna out.

00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:54.560
 (all laughing)

00:21:54.560 --> 00:21:55.800
 - Well, we've had a lot of guests today,

00:21:55.800 --> 00:21:57.360
 Jimmy Carter, Jeremy Corbyn.

00:21:57.360 --> 00:21:59.480
 (all laughing)

00:21:59.480 --> 00:22:00.600
 - Actually, on tarot actials,

00:22:00.600 --> 00:22:02.440
 they wore a bit hairy, some of them.

00:22:02.440 --> 00:22:05.760
 They had what is called tarot fuzz in,

00:22:05.760 --> 00:22:08.840
 I found in an email thread that I sort of found

00:22:08.840 --> 00:22:11.400
 archive between paleontologists.

00:22:11.400 --> 00:22:13.600
 But yeah, they found hair fibers on some of them.

00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:15.160
 And they also think this might be

00:22:15.160 --> 00:22:17.640
 what helped them be able to fly to do with insulation.

00:22:17.640 --> 00:22:19.400
 But there was sort of fuzzy or fluffy.

00:22:19.400 --> 00:22:20.240
 - That's really cool.

00:22:20.240 --> 00:22:21.080
 - That's cool.

00:22:21.080 --> 00:22:21.920
 - It's quite cute.

00:22:21.920 --> 00:22:23.440
 But not on the wings, I think, just on the bod.

00:22:23.440 --> 00:22:24.280
 - Just that.

00:22:24.280 --> 00:22:27.000
 - Fuzzy bod, bat wings.

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:29.040
 - They were also the babies.

00:22:29.040 --> 00:22:30.520
 You know what they call the baby tarot actal?

00:22:30.520 --> 00:22:31.360
 Or tarot sore?

00:22:31.360 --> 00:22:32.680
 - Um, no.

00:22:32.680 --> 00:22:33.880
 - Flap wings.

00:22:33.880 --> 00:22:34.720
 - Oh, yeah.

00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:36.280
 - Flap wings, nice little word.

00:22:36.280 --> 00:22:37.640
 And they were, so they were first identified

00:22:37.640 --> 00:22:39.760
 by a guy called George's Curvier.

00:22:39.760 --> 00:22:40.920
 - George Curvier?

00:22:40.920 --> 00:22:41.760
 - George.

00:22:41.760 --> 00:22:43.080
 - George.

00:22:43.080 --> 00:22:45.120
 - George Curvier.

00:22:45.120 --> 00:22:47.160
 - What stage reading that census did you realize

00:22:47.160 --> 00:22:48.000
 you were at George?

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:49.080
 - You didn't even call him Gub.

00:22:49.080 --> 00:22:52.320
 (laughing)

00:22:52.320 --> 00:22:53.080
 - So.

00:22:53.080 --> 00:22:54.880
 - Sorry, who was George Curvier then?

00:22:54.880 --> 00:22:59.880
 - George's Curvier was a, he was a scientist.

00:22:59.880 --> 00:23:02.440
 And he was the person who discovered,

00:23:02.440 --> 00:23:07.440
 or firstly identified the flying terrasaur in 1809.

00:23:07.440 --> 00:23:10.400
 And he said that in 1812, he said

00:23:10.400 --> 00:23:12.720
 that they were unlikely, we as humans,

00:23:12.720 --> 00:23:16.280
 were ever unlikely to find any animal as large as that.

00:23:16.280 --> 00:23:19.600
 Then 10 years after he died, we discovered dinosaurs.

00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:22.040
 (laughing)

00:23:22.040 --> 00:23:23.040
 - Oh, what a shame.

00:23:23.040 --> 00:23:25.680
 He was the first person to say that they flew.

00:23:25.680 --> 00:23:28.480
 But the first person to describe them in any way scientifically

00:23:28.480 --> 00:23:30.280
 was Cosimo Collini.

00:23:30.280 --> 00:23:33.160
 And he was most famous for being Voltaire's secretary.

00:23:33.160 --> 00:23:34.000
 - Yeah.

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:34.840
 - So it was.

00:23:34.840 --> 00:23:35.680
 - It was not cool, isn't it?

00:23:35.680 --> 00:23:37.200
 Such a weird two worlds colliding.

00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:38.040
 - Yeah.

00:23:38.040 --> 00:23:38.880
 - Yeah.

00:23:38.880 --> 00:23:40.360
 - I wonder where he was secretary,

00:23:40.360 --> 00:23:44.920
 because Voltaire, just down the road from us in Comic Garden,

00:23:44.920 --> 00:23:45.760
 he used to live there.

00:23:45.760 --> 00:23:46.600
 - Oh, Voltaire.

00:23:46.600 --> 00:23:47.440
 - Yeah.

00:23:47.440 --> 00:23:48.360
 - I think probably in front of life.

00:23:48.360 --> 00:23:49.720
 - That's why he lived most of his life.

00:23:49.720 --> 00:23:50.560
 - Okay, cool.

00:23:50.560 --> 00:23:53.800
 - I think, you said 1809, I think it was 1801, wasn't it?

00:23:53.800 --> 00:23:54.640
 - Yeah.

00:23:54.640 --> 00:23:55.480
 - And it's Curvier.

00:23:55.480 --> 00:23:57.980
 (laughing)

00:23:57.980 --> 00:23:59.680
 - He was also, I mean, not only did he see the baby,

00:23:59.680 --> 00:24:01.960
 he was also the person who was the foundation

00:24:01.960 --> 00:24:03.440
 of all Darwin's theories.

00:24:03.440 --> 00:24:04.960
 He was the person who realized

00:24:04.960 --> 00:24:07.160
 that animals could become extinct.

00:24:07.160 --> 00:24:08.720
 - I've one last thing before we move on,

00:24:08.720 --> 00:24:10.680
 which is, did you know that there were terraces

00:24:10.680 --> 00:24:12.280
 in the movie "Citizen Kane"?

00:24:12.280 --> 00:24:13.360
 (laughing)

00:24:13.360 --> 00:24:14.200
 - What?

00:24:14.200 --> 00:24:15.520
 - So this is really worth checking out.

00:24:15.520 --> 00:24:16.920
 So obviously "Citizen Kane" held up

00:24:16.920 --> 00:24:19.840
 as one of the greatest movies ever made, Orson Wells.

00:24:19.840 --> 00:24:22.960
 He had an incredible script, he had an incredible cast,

00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:25.120
 what he didn't have, was an incredible budget.

00:24:25.120 --> 00:24:27.360
 So for a lot of the movie, they had to reuse

00:24:27.360 --> 00:24:28.840
 certain things from other movies.

00:24:28.840 --> 00:24:30.440
 And there's a scene in the movie, and I've watched it,

00:24:30.440 --> 00:24:33.480
 where they're at some sort of party that's on a beach.

00:24:33.480 --> 00:24:35.360
 And in the background to show a sort of

00:24:35.360 --> 00:24:40.360
 jungly background, they had to borrow footage from King Kong,

00:24:40.360 --> 00:24:43.240
 or son of King Kong, because they couldn't afford

00:24:43.240 --> 00:24:44.360
 to do it themselves. - Oh my god.

00:24:44.360 --> 00:24:45.200
 - Yeah.

00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:48.120
 So in the background, you see these giant terraces

00:24:48.120 --> 00:24:49.920
 from the movie. - No way, no way.

00:24:49.920 --> 00:24:52.160
 - It's a spoiler alert, that's what Rosebud is.

00:24:52.160 --> 00:24:53.000
 - Yeah.

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:54.000
 - The name of his pet, "Terrosa".

00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:55.400
 (laughing)

00:24:55.400 --> 00:24:58.000
 (upbeat music)

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:02.760
 - Okay, it's time for fact number three,

00:25:02.760 --> 00:25:04.480
 and that is James.

00:25:04.480 --> 00:25:07.680
 Okay, my fact this week is that the world's first casino

00:25:07.680 --> 00:25:10.200
 had a rule that you could only gamble

00:25:10.200 --> 00:25:12.400
 if you were wearing a tricon hat.

00:25:12.400 --> 00:25:14.600
 (laughing)

00:25:14.600 --> 00:25:17.040
 So, this was in Venice.

00:25:17.040 --> 00:25:22.040
 It was in 1638, and it was called Il Riddotto,

00:25:22.040 --> 00:25:24.200
 which means the private room.

00:25:24.200 --> 00:25:26.640
 And Riddotto was actually a word which was used for

00:25:26.640 --> 00:25:29.080
 like illegal gambling clubs at the time,

00:25:29.080 --> 00:25:30.680
 but they closed them all down,

00:25:30.680 --> 00:25:32.400
 and everyone was very upset about it,

00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:33.320
 but they said, "No, don't worry,

00:25:33.320 --> 00:25:36.160
 "we're gonna make an official one that you can all go to."

00:25:36.160 --> 00:25:38.720
 So, by the rules, everyone's allowed to go there,

00:25:38.720 --> 00:25:40.360
 you're all allowed to gamble here, don't worry,

00:25:40.360 --> 00:25:42.200
 you'll all be able to still gamble,

00:25:42.200 --> 00:25:43.760
 but if you do want to gamble,

00:25:43.760 --> 00:25:46.760
 you're gonna have to wear a tricon hat and a mask,

00:25:46.760 --> 00:25:49.480
 and tricon hats a mask, or it's extremely expensive,

00:25:49.480 --> 00:25:51.520
 and so actually the poor people couldn't do it anymore.

00:25:51.520 --> 00:25:53.440
 - So these were the kind of mask raid masks

00:25:53.440 --> 00:25:54.760
 that you would go and they-- - Yes, exactly.

00:25:54.760 --> 00:25:57.400
 - Really sorts out your poker face problem, doesn't it,

00:25:57.400 --> 00:25:58.240
 when you're gambling.

00:25:58.240 --> 00:25:59.760
 - It's pretty good, it's fine. - It's pretty good mask on.

00:25:59.760 --> 00:26:01.440
 How could they have called anything?

00:26:01.440 --> 00:26:03.600
 - I guess usually they don't cover the lips, do they?

00:26:03.600 --> 00:26:07.120
 They're sort of-- - So if your tail is a big pal.

00:26:07.120 --> 00:26:08.440
 - No, if your tail is a big pal.

00:26:08.440 --> 00:26:10.000
 - Because they normally do say,

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:11.720
 but your tail isn't your eyes.

00:26:11.720 --> 00:26:12.560
 - Not like-- - Do they?

00:26:12.560 --> 00:26:14.440
 - Yeah, not pulling faces with your arm.

00:26:14.440 --> 00:26:16.640
 - But the masks, you can see out of the mask,

00:26:16.640 --> 00:26:18.040
 you can still see people's eyes.

00:26:18.040 --> 00:26:19.120
 - Yeah, you can see, well yeah,

00:26:19.120 --> 00:26:20.320
 I didn't know the eyes were the tail.

00:26:20.320 --> 00:26:21.520
 I've been looking in the wrong bit.

00:26:21.520 --> 00:26:23.160
 - Love you, look at that, the nose.

00:26:23.160 --> 00:26:25.880
 There's no one's how to move, it's still there.

00:26:25.880 --> 00:26:28.320
 - Talking about the casinos in Italy,

00:26:28.320 --> 00:26:32.240
 in 1963, Sean Connery, I just couldn't believe this fact,

00:26:32.240 --> 00:26:34.880
 but it's there.

00:26:34.880 --> 00:26:38.720
 He's successfully backed the number 17 three times running

00:26:38.720 --> 00:26:40.600
 at the St. Vincent Casino in Italy.

00:26:40.600 --> 00:26:42.160
 - Yeah, you heard that, sorry?

00:26:42.160 --> 00:26:43.520
 - Matt, yeah. - I have heard the story.

00:26:43.520 --> 00:26:46.840
 I know that to be true in a way,

00:26:46.840 --> 00:26:50.160
 but it did happen to be that there was a lot of press there.

00:26:50.160 --> 00:26:51.960
 It was basically a publicity something like that.

00:26:51.960 --> 00:26:54.360
 - No, you think it was a publicity stunt,

00:26:54.360 --> 00:26:56.280
 but I like to believe it. - I think it was.

00:26:56.280 --> 00:26:58.680
 - Yeah. - Although he did, he put it on 17 twice

00:26:58.680 --> 00:27:00.320
 beforehand and it didn't work, didn't he?

00:27:00.320 --> 00:27:01.520
 It still seemed like he was like,

00:27:01.520 --> 00:27:02.760
 "Oh, something's going wrong."

00:27:02.760 --> 00:27:04.000
 - Oh, no.

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:05.840
 - But yeah, basically most people these days

00:27:05.840 --> 00:27:07.360
 think it was a publicity stunt,

00:27:07.360 --> 00:27:10.520
 because it happened to be the week before his movie came out

00:27:10.520 --> 00:27:13.040
 and he was with all the press and everything like that.

00:27:13.040 --> 00:27:15.240
 - I saw a bit of footage the other day,

00:27:15.240 --> 00:27:18.240
 totally unrelated to it, but to this fact,

00:27:18.240 --> 00:27:20.280
 so it just happened to be watching it.

00:27:20.280 --> 00:27:22.080
 I'm convinced it must be a publicity stunt,

00:27:22.080 --> 00:27:24.760
 but I can't see anyone that says it was.

00:27:24.760 --> 00:27:27.720
 - Muhammad Ali, when he was up against Sunny Liston,

00:27:27.720 --> 00:27:30.440
 he turned to get the fight and to really get at him.

00:27:30.440 --> 00:27:32.720
 He kept showing up at his house in a bus

00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:35.280
 and yelling through a megaphone at three o'clock in the morning,

00:27:35.280 --> 00:27:37.040
 getting a method that has just infuriating him.

00:27:37.040 --> 00:27:39.400
 And there's footage of Sunny Liston at a table

00:27:39.400 --> 00:27:41.240
 in a casino rolling dice.

00:27:41.240 --> 00:27:43.800
 And Muhammad Ali beside him, just yelling at him,

00:27:43.800 --> 00:27:46.200
 I'm gonna take you down doing all this Ali stuff.

00:27:46.200 --> 00:27:49.160
 And just out of nowhere, Sunny Liston pulls a gun

00:27:49.160 --> 00:27:52.240
 out of his pocket and he fires it at Muhammad Ali.

00:27:52.240 --> 00:27:53.920
 And you see footage of Ali running out

00:27:53.920 --> 00:27:55.280
 and everyone freaking out.

00:27:55.280 --> 00:27:57.720
 And it turns out that the gun only has blanks in it

00:27:57.720 --> 00:28:00.000
 and he fires a couple of shots into his jacket

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:02.160
 and then just goes back to rolling dice.

00:28:02.160 --> 00:28:03.520
 And everyone's fine with it.

00:28:03.520 --> 00:28:04.360
 And it moves on.

00:28:04.360 --> 00:28:05.720
 He must have crapped himself.

00:28:05.720 --> 00:28:08.240
 (laughing)

00:28:08.240 --> 00:28:12.720
 - Found this great line from Stephen Wright about gambling.

00:28:12.720 --> 00:28:15.000
 In Vegas, I got into a long argument

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:16.800
 with the man at the roulette wheel

00:28:16.800 --> 00:28:19.440
 over what I considered to be an odd number.

00:28:19.440 --> 00:28:22.280
 (laughing)

00:28:22.280 --> 00:28:23.920
 - Do you know that all, you know this,

00:28:23.920 --> 00:28:25.400
 you all know the fact that all the numbers

00:28:25.400 --> 00:28:27.400
 on a roulette wheel added up together.

00:28:27.400 --> 00:28:28.240
 - No.

00:28:28.240 --> 00:28:29.240
 - They add up to 666, do you know that?

00:28:29.240 --> 00:28:30.840
 - Yeah, it's a bad sign.

00:28:30.840 --> 00:28:32.520
 People should know not to enter casinos.

00:28:32.520 --> 00:28:33.880
 (laughing)

00:28:33.880 --> 00:28:36.360
 But I actually did some research on roulette

00:28:36.360 --> 00:28:39.080
 for this series, the R series.

00:28:39.080 --> 00:28:41.880
 And I was reading into the number zero, quite heavily.

00:28:41.880 --> 00:28:44.560
 And did you know that zero was banned on roulette tables

00:28:44.560 --> 00:28:45.480
 in this country?

00:28:45.480 --> 00:28:48.400
 In the, I think it was the late '60s?

00:28:48.400 --> 00:28:49.400
 - Fairly.

00:28:49.400 --> 00:28:50.240
 - Yeah, so.

00:28:50.240 --> 00:28:53.000
 This way is the odds too much in favor of the casino?

00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:55.160
 - Well, it's way the odds in favor of the casino at all,

00:28:55.160 --> 00:28:56.000
 basically.

00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:57.640
 So, like you'll know, if you go to a casino today,

00:28:57.640 --> 00:29:00.080
 they all have a zero and they absolutely have to.

00:29:00.080 --> 00:29:02.280
 Otherwise, a casino wouldn't be able to come off

00:29:02.280 --> 00:29:04.720
 making money because there are 36 numbers.

00:29:04.720 --> 00:29:06.680
 And you're given odds of one in 36.

00:29:06.680 --> 00:29:08.080
 But there's this zero on.

00:29:08.080 --> 00:29:10.080
 Sometimes there's a double zero or triple zero

00:29:10.080 --> 00:29:11.760
 if you're really being ripped off.

00:29:11.760 --> 00:29:14.520
 But yeah, in the '60s, in 1967,

00:29:14.520 --> 00:29:16.800
 the law laws, like the equivalent of the Supreme Court,

00:29:16.800 --> 00:29:18.800
 decided that they didn't approve of this.

00:29:18.800 --> 00:29:21.680
 They thought it was unfair that the casino would have any advantage

00:29:21.680 --> 00:29:24.000
 and they banned zeros from roulette tables.

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:24.840
 - Wow.

00:29:24.840 --> 00:29:27.160
 - And Scotland, your policeman would go round casinos

00:29:27.160 --> 00:29:29.640
 and like check for zeros on tables

00:29:29.640 --> 00:29:31.280
 and then close them down if they had them.

00:29:31.280 --> 00:29:32.520
 - And how long did that last for?

00:29:32.520 --> 00:29:33.760
 - It lasted a year.

00:29:33.760 --> 00:29:35.480
 And then they realized that all casinos were saying,

00:29:35.480 --> 00:29:37.640
 well, we're not going to do business anymore.

00:29:37.640 --> 00:29:38.880
 And people like casinos.

00:29:38.880 --> 00:29:39.720
 - It's so interesting.

00:29:39.720 --> 00:29:41.400
 - And so they changed that law.

00:29:41.400 --> 00:29:42.240
 - Amazing.

00:29:42.240 --> 00:29:45.040
 I was reading a thing that apparently something

00:29:45.040 --> 00:29:47.160
 that's experienced by quite a few casino goers

00:29:47.160 --> 00:29:49.680
 if they sit down as a slot machine,

00:29:49.680 --> 00:29:53.320
 they'll sometimes sit on quite a damp chair.

00:29:53.320 --> 00:29:56.440
 And that's because very, very dedicated gamblers

00:29:56.440 --> 00:29:58.480
 who've been playing on a single slot machine for ages

00:29:58.480 --> 00:29:59.840
 and know that if they leave,

00:29:59.840 --> 00:30:01.320
 it might be the next one that wins.

00:30:01.320 --> 00:30:03.440
 Don't go to the toilet, they're just going their trousers.

00:30:03.440 --> 00:30:04.640
 It's a big thing.

00:30:04.640 --> 00:30:08.280
 Sort of urinated urine-covered seats.

00:30:08.280 --> 00:30:09.840
 There's a big problem in casinos.

00:30:09.840 --> 00:30:10.680
 - Is it really?

00:30:10.680 --> 00:30:11.440
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:30:11.440 --> 00:30:12.280
 It's certainly--

00:30:12.280 --> 00:30:13.240
 - Well, a big problem.

00:30:13.240 --> 00:30:15.760
 - Well, I never noticed it when I've been to casinos.

00:30:15.760 --> 00:30:17.840
 I must say, but I can believe that.

00:30:17.840 --> 00:30:19.880
 I think they were like adult diapers.

00:30:19.880 --> 00:30:21.560
 - Well, this is, yeah, there's new products

00:30:21.560 --> 00:30:24.040
 that have been made specifically for a casino goers.

00:30:24.040 --> 00:30:28.240
 It's called "Player's Advantage" and the idea is,

00:30:28.240 --> 00:30:30.960
 it's a diaper that gets you an additional 10 to 12 hours

00:30:30.960 --> 00:30:32.360
 of continuous play.

00:30:32.360 --> 00:30:35.200
 So you can put, you know.

00:30:35.200 --> 00:30:37.680
 - Well, you've got to take a long, hard look at your life

00:30:37.680 --> 00:30:40.280
 and then when you're buying.

00:30:40.280 --> 00:30:42.120
 And there's advantage or whatever.

00:30:43.240 --> 00:30:45.680
 - The roulette wheel, we don't really know who properly

00:30:45.680 --> 00:30:47.360
 invented the modern one, but a lot of people

00:30:47.360 --> 00:30:50.600
 think it was Blaze Pascale, who's the mathematician,

00:30:50.600 --> 00:30:53.560
 who's like the father of probability, really.

00:30:53.560 --> 00:30:57.000
 And the idea that a lot of places say, I don't know if this is true,

00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:00.400
 that he was trying to make a perpetual motion machine,

00:31:00.400 --> 00:31:02.880
 which would make it a really bad game of roulette, wouldn't it?

00:31:02.880 --> 00:31:03.720
 - Very dull.

00:31:03.720 --> 00:31:07.280
 - The ball just comes from never, and ever, and ever.

00:31:07.280 --> 00:31:10.280
 - Well, the diaper would come in handy in that case.

00:31:10.280 --> 00:31:12.860
 (upbeat music)

00:31:12.860 --> 00:31:17.600
 - Okay, it's time for our final fact of the show.

00:31:17.600 --> 00:31:18.880
 And that is my fact.

00:31:18.880 --> 00:31:21.880
 My fact this week is to promote his new product,

00:31:21.880 --> 00:31:25.000
 the inventor of Vaseline, would demonstrate his invention

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:29.160
 by dipping his hands in acid and then healing the burn wounds

00:31:29.160 --> 00:31:30.160
 with the balm.

00:31:30.160 --> 00:31:32.400
 - Dedicated to his product, I'd buy it after that.

00:31:32.400 --> 00:31:35.080
 - Yeah, well, how quickly does Vaseline work?

00:31:35.080 --> 00:31:38.440
 - So this is, okay, so we've mentioned this guy very briefly,

00:31:38.440 --> 00:31:41.720
 he just got on the podcast, his name is Robert Chesa-Brue,

00:31:41.720 --> 00:31:42.560
 which does--

00:31:42.560 --> 00:31:43.560
 - I call him Chisbrue.

00:31:43.560 --> 00:31:44.960
 - I really wanna call him Chisbrue,

00:31:44.960 --> 00:31:48.040
 and I googled how to pronounce his name a bunch of times,

00:31:48.040 --> 00:31:49.760
 and it came up with Chesa-Brue.

00:31:49.760 --> 00:31:50.760
 - Okay, let's call him Chisbrue.

00:31:50.760 --> 00:31:51.600
 - Chisbrue is way better.

00:31:51.600 --> 00:31:56.600
 So yeah, Robert Chisbrue, he patented the balm Vaseline in 1872.

00:31:56.600 --> 00:31:58.920
 So he had this new invention.

00:31:58.920 --> 00:32:01.000
 He'd spent 10 years experimenting on himself

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:02.000
 to see that it would work.

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:04.440
 But for the time, it was hard to convince people

00:32:04.440 --> 00:32:06.040
 that it had any practical use.

00:32:06.040 --> 00:32:08.560
 So he became one of those traveling salesmen,

00:32:08.560 --> 00:32:11.360
 and he went to department stores all over New York,

00:32:11.360 --> 00:32:14.240
 where he would arrive at the location and do a demonstration.

00:32:14.240 --> 00:32:17.120
 The demonstration consisted of him dipping his hand in acid,

00:32:17.120 --> 00:32:20.400
 or sometimes holding his hand over an open flame,

00:32:20.400 --> 00:32:22.880
 burning himself, and then putting the balm on,

00:32:22.880 --> 00:32:24.640
 and then showing his other hand

00:32:24.640 --> 00:32:27.200
 that he had done a demonstration on the day before,

00:32:27.200 --> 00:32:28.400
 and how it had healed it up.

00:32:28.400 --> 00:32:30.880
 Yeah, so it was one hand at a time.

00:32:30.880 --> 00:32:32.840
 - Oh, wow, so it was the blue Peter of his day.

00:32:32.840 --> 00:32:33.680
 - Exactly.

00:32:33.680 --> 00:32:34.520
 - So he was one I made earlier.

00:32:34.520 --> 00:32:35.360
 - Yeah, exactly.

00:32:35.360 --> 00:32:37.920
 - A lot of trust in that demonstration, though, isn't there?

00:32:37.920 --> 00:32:39.200
 - Yes, yeah.

00:32:39.200 --> 00:32:40.720
 - 'Cause it fit, I mean, you're trusting

00:32:40.720 --> 00:32:42.320
 that he had done that the day before,

00:32:42.320 --> 00:32:44.520
 and he's not just every single day putting his one

00:32:44.520 --> 00:32:47.320
 with a hand in it, and so that's it.

00:32:47.320 --> 00:32:48.840
 I bet it was his left hand always

00:32:48.840 --> 00:32:50.240
 that he put it in acid, isn't it?

00:32:50.240 --> 00:32:51.640
 - That's true.

00:32:51.640 --> 00:32:55.200
 - Yeah, but so he did that and used to travel all over.

00:32:55.200 --> 00:32:59.240
 It was real frontline salesmanship from Old Cheeseborough.

00:32:59.240 --> 00:33:01.120
 - He would, he had a horse and cart, didn't he?

00:33:01.120 --> 00:33:02.640
 And he would give away samples,

00:33:02.640 --> 00:33:04.000
 and apparently this is the first time

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:06.240
 people gave away samples of any products.

00:33:06.240 --> 00:33:07.480
 - Wow, that's a very good one.

00:33:07.480 --> 00:33:09.320
 - I don't know if that's, it doesn't sound true, does it?

00:33:09.320 --> 00:33:10.920
 It sounds like someone else must have thought of it,

00:33:10.920 --> 00:33:12.960
 but this is the first example that we've found.

00:33:12.960 --> 00:33:15.640
 - So he used to, Chesaborough or Cheeseborough,

00:33:15.640 --> 00:33:20.320
 whatever his name is, he used to have a distilled

00:33:20.320 --> 00:33:22.760
 sperm whale oil business, so yeah,

00:33:22.760 --> 00:33:24.720
 and that started becoming redundant

00:33:24.720 --> 00:33:27.120
 because the oil industry became huge,

00:33:27.120 --> 00:33:28.520
 and he was basically going bust,

00:33:28.520 --> 00:33:32.800
 and he used his very last few dollars to go to Pennsylvania,

00:33:32.800 --> 00:33:36.360
 and he was going to get a job in the oil industry.

00:33:36.360 --> 00:33:40.040
 And he noticed all these oil workers were always complaining

00:33:40.040 --> 00:33:41.280
 about the stuff called Rodwax,

00:33:41.280 --> 00:33:43.960
 which is a black gunk that glued up the drill heads

00:33:43.960 --> 00:33:45.760
 and then came out and cleaned it off.

00:33:45.760 --> 00:33:46.960
 And he got curious about this,

00:33:46.960 --> 00:33:48.600
 and he took a bucket of it home and he thought,

00:33:48.600 --> 00:33:51.280
 because if they got wounds and burns and cuts and things,

00:33:51.280 --> 00:33:53.640
 they smeared on it, it seemed to get better.

00:33:53.640 --> 00:33:55.680
 I don't think it's got healing qualities, actually,

00:33:55.680 --> 00:33:57.560
 but what it does, it keeps the dirt out of it,

00:33:57.560 --> 00:33:59.000
 that's one reason it's good for you.

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:00.720
 - Yeah, and keeps moisture in, doesn't it?

00:34:00.720 --> 00:34:01.560
 - He was fascinated by this.

00:34:01.560 --> 00:34:04.440
 He took this home and his dad said he spent years and years

00:34:04.440 --> 00:34:06.680
 experimenting to turn it from this black goo

00:34:06.680 --> 00:34:10.120
 into this very clear, almost translucent balm.

00:34:10.120 --> 00:34:13.360
 And did you know he was a Brit?

00:34:13.360 --> 00:34:14.200
 - No, I was a Brit.

00:34:14.200 --> 00:34:15.040
 - So he was American.

00:34:15.040 --> 00:34:17.440
 - No, he worked in America, but he was actually a Brit,

00:34:17.440 --> 00:34:19.800
 and Queen Victoria used Vaseline.

00:34:19.800 --> 00:34:22.480
 We don't know why, she was a big fan,

00:34:22.480 --> 00:34:25.200
 and she actually knighted him in 1883.

00:34:25.200 --> 00:34:27.520
 - But unfortunately, the sod slipped off his shell.

00:34:27.520 --> 00:34:29.960
 (laughing)

00:34:29.960 --> 00:34:31.760
 'Cause he did used to cover himself in it.

00:34:31.760 --> 00:34:33.760
 That's the one thing that we mentioned.

00:34:33.760 --> 00:34:35.720
 He thought that it was just this amazing thing

00:34:35.720 --> 00:34:37.000
 that would cure everything,

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:38.880
 and he thought there was some special stuff in it

00:34:38.880 --> 00:34:40.080
 that would make him better.

00:34:40.080 --> 00:34:42.680
 And he got pleuricy and he covered his whole body in it,

00:34:42.680 --> 00:34:43.840
 and he did actually get better,

00:34:43.840 --> 00:34:45.360
 but probably not 'cause of that.

00:34:45.360 --> 00:34:50.360
 - Well, he lived in '96, and he got sick in his late '50s.

00:34:50.360 --> 00:34:55.320
 And he hired a private nurse who was instructed

00:34:55.320 --> 00:34:58.800
 to rub him down, whole body rubbed down in Vaseline every day.

00:34:58.800 --> 00:34:59.800
 - I can't matter that job.

00:34:59.800 --> 00:35:03.200
 - And he had just been full of it, literally every day,

00:35:03.200 --> 00:35:06.800
 and he attributed his longevity to exactly that.

00:35:06.800 --> 00:35:07.640
 - Yeah.

00:35:07.640 --> 00:35:10.000
 - I mean, you would if it's your big business, right?

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:11.160
 - You would say that.

00:35:11.160 --> 00:35:13.960
 - He was secretly taking a lot of sort of morphine

00:35:13.960 --> 00:35:15.440
 and aracy to hold.

00:35:15.440 --> 00:35:16.280
 (laughing)

00:35:16.280 --> 00:35:19.920
 - But I dug out some other uses of Vaseline,

00:35:19.920 --> 00:35:20.920
 apart from the obvious.

00:35:20.920 --> 00:35:21.760
 - Oh yeah.

00:35:21.760 --> 00:35:26.120
 - So it has been smeared on fish hooks to lure trout,

00:35:26.120 --> 00:35:28.600
 treat nappy rash, and toenail fungus.

00:35:28.600 --> 00:35:30.800
 It's used for staunching nose bleeds,

00:35:30.800 --> 00:35:33.000
 removing ring marks from furniture.

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:36.240
 It's dabbed on cheeks by actresses to simulate tears,

00:35:36.240 --> 00:35:38.480
 removing makeup, predicting gun barrels,

00:35:38.480 --> 00:35:39.960
 shining patent leather shoes,

00:35:39.960 --> 00:35:41.560
 lubricating slide rules.

00:35:41.560 --> 00:35:43.280
 That's a neat use.

00:35:43.280 --> 00:35:44.120
 (laughing)

00:35:44.120 --> 00:35:45.760
 - That's a use for this afraid or sex issue.

00:35:45.760 --> 00:35:48.520
 (laughing)

00:35:48.520 --> 00:35:50.840
 - And then the moustache wax, sunscreen,

00:35:50.840 --> 00:35:52.720
 anti-failing for boats.

00:35:52.720 --> 00:35:55.160
 It's used by ear, nose, and throat surgeons

00:35:55.160 --> 00:35:57.320
 to combat nasal crusting.

00:35:57.320 --> 00:35:58.160
 - Ooh!

00:35:58.160 --> 00:35:59.600
 - I don't want to get nasal crusting

00:35:59.600 --> 00:36:01.080
 when you're under the knife, do you know?

00:36:01.080 --> 00:36:01.920
 (laughing)

00:36:01.920 --> 00:36:03.800
 - I like the one I really like is,

00:36:03.800 --> 00:36:06.160
 it's supposedly used in boxing before a fight,

00:36:06.160 --> 00:36:08.560
 so that a punch doesn't quite land on your face

00:36:08.560 --> 00:36:10.400
 and sort of slips off as you are doing.

00:36:10.400 --> 00:36:12.440
 - You see them put it on the cheekbones, do you?

00:36:12.440 --> 00:36:14.720
 - Yeah, and they're not allowed to do it mid-fight,

00:36:14.720 --> 00:36:16.160
 and some people are caught doing it,

00:36:16.160 --> 00:36:17.400
 so the coaches will come over

00:36:17.400 --> 00:36:19.640
 and subtly Vaseline their face up.

00:36:19.640 --> 00:36:22.720
 - In American football, if you're trying to stop

00:36:22.720 --> 00:36:24.000
 someone from getting to your quarterback,

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:25.560
 you're not allowed to hold them, that's a big thing.

00:36:25.560 --> 00:36:26.520
 You're allowed to block them,

00:36:26.520 --> 00:36:27.360
 but not hold them.

00:36:27.360 --> 00:36:28.200
 - Yeah.

00:36:28.200 --> 00:36:31.080
 - And so people would put Vaseline on their whole bodies

00:36:31.080 --> 00:36:32.640
 so that when you're putting your hands out

00:36:32.640 --> 00:36:35.720
 onto the chest to block them, they just slip away from you.

00:36:35.720 --> 00:36:36.560
 - Wow.

00:36:36.560 --> 00:36:39.120
 - But the defensive people, they kind of go against it

00:36:39.120 --> 00:36:42.120
 by putting like drawing pins in their gloves

00:36:42.120 --> 00:36:43.840
 and like thumbtacks in their gloves,

00:36:43.840 --> 00:36:45.520
 so they can grip on even better.

00:36:45.520 --> 00:36:46.960
 - Is that allowed?

00:36:46.960 --> 00:36:48.480
 - I don't think it is allowed.

00:36:48.480 --> 00:36:49.480
 It doesn't sound allowed,

00:36:49.480 --> 00:36:51.120
 but I think people still do it.

00:36:51.120 --> 00:36:52.440
 - Wow.

00:36:52.440 --> 00:36:54.040
 - There was John, you're a director,

00:36:54.040 --> 00:36:55.560
 you've done a lot of advert director.

00:36:55.560 --> 00:36:56.400
 - Yeah.

00:36:56.400 --> 00:36:58.600
 - So do you know about the fact that it's used as a technique

00:36:58.600 --> 00:37:00.720
 to make a sort of soft focus effect?

00:37:00.720 --> 00:37:01.560
 - Yes.

00:37:01.560 --> 00:37:02.400
 - Yeah.

00:37:02.400 --> 00:37:03.960
 - So they smear Vaseline on the lens of a camera.

00:37:03.960 --> 00:37:06.720
 - They'd say entry that put some Vaseline on the lens.

00:37:06.720 --> 00:37:07.640
 - Yeah, it's extraordinary.

00:37:07.640 --> 00:37:10.600
 It's used in a lot of soft core porn.

00:37:10.600 --> 00:37:12.360
 - You know, you get that sort of thing where it's like

00:37:12.360 --> 00:37:15.400
 a dreamy look around the face, the actress or whatever.

00:37:15.400 --> 00:37:16.240
 - You can imagine.

00:37:16.240 --> 00:37:17.840
 And I didn't know you had such a strong career

00:37:17.840 --> 00:37:19.320
 in the porn industry before.

00:37:19.320 --> 00:37:20.480
 - Yes, absolutely.

00:37:20.480 --> 00:37:21.320
 (laughing)

00:37:21.320 --> 00:37:23.640
 - It was lubricating slide rules before you.

00:37:23.640 --> 00:37:26.080
 (laughing)

00:37:26.080 --> 00:37:28.880
 - So they use it in Star Trek, for example.

00:37:28.880 --> 00:37:32.600
 Any time that Captain Kirk played by William Shatner

00:37:32.600 --> 00:37:35.200
 would see a girl that was gonna be the girl of the week

00:37:35.200 --> 00:37:36.440
 as it were.

00:37:36.440 --> 00:37:38.480
 They would use this soft focus on that girl.

00:37:38.480 --> 00:37:40.080
 - So he goes, "Mr. D.R."

00:37:40.080 --> 00:37:40.920
 - Yeah.

00:37:40.920 --> 00:37:41.760
 - It looks like he's gone, "Mr. D.R."

00:37:41.760 --> 00:37:42.600
 - Yeah.

00:37:42.600 --> 00:37:44.000
 - So I think I saw a remember that in Star Trek.

00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:47.920
 - And Doris Day, the actress used to have in her contract

00:37:47.920 --> 00:37:50.720
 that close-ups when she got older all had to be done

00:37:50.720 --> 00:37:52.920
 in soft focus because she was too worried

00:37:52.920 --> 00:37:55.600
 about her, the lines on her face and so on.

00:37:55.600 --> 00:37:56.440
 - Really?

00:37:56.440 --> 00:37:58.320
 - Yeah, so there's movies with her in Rock Hudson,

00:37:58.320 --> 00:38:00.600
 where Rock Hudson is in clear shot

00:38:00.600 --> 00:38:02.400
 as a close-up cut to Doris Day.

00:38:02.400 --> 00:38:04.040
 She's in the street, and it looks really odd.

00:38:04.040 --> 00:38:05.000
 - That is so weird.

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:06.000
 - Yeah.

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:09.480
 - They also, I just found one use on smearing over glass.

00:38:09.480 --> 00:38:12.200
 One use for it related to that, if you're a burglar,

00:38:12.200 --> 00:38:14.960
 was uncovered in 2012 when someone went around

00:38:14.960 --> 00:38:16.360
 burglaring apartments.

00:38:16.360 --> 00:38:18.560
 And people realized that he was doing the same thing

00:38:18.560 --> 00:38:20.440
 every apartment he burgled, which was smearing Vaseline

00:38:20.440 --> 00:38:22.560
 over the opposite apartment's people.

00:38:22.560 --> 00:38:25.480
 So when they looked out of their people, they couldn't see him

00:38:25.480 --> 00:38:26.920
 and I don't know why he thought they couldn't open

00:38:26.920 --> 00:38:27.760
 their own doors.

00:38:27.760 --> 00:38:29.880
 - Or they thought, "Who's that dreamy guy?"

00:38:29.880 --> 00:38:31.720
 (all laughing)

00:38:31.720 --> 00:38:33.160
 - Burgling that house.

00:38:33.160 --> 00:38:35.320
 Harrison Ford would never rob a home.

00:38:35.320 --> 00:38:36.640
 (all laughing)

00:38:36.640 --> 00:38:38.760
 - And you should mention me in commercials

00:38:38.760 --> 00:38:41.200
 and Captain Kirk in the same paragraph.

00:38:41.200 --> 00:38:43.400
 Just two of the ads I shot were actually

00:38:43.400 --> 00:38:44.440
 with William Chatner.

00:38:44.440 --> 00:38:45.280
 - Oh really?

00:38:45.280 --> 00:38:47.520
 - Yeah, in LA for Kellogg's, yeah.

00:38:47.520 --> 00:38:48.360
 - Really?

00:38:48.360 --> 00:38:49.880
 - He was great, he was such a good guy.

00:38:49.880 --> 00:38:51.120
 I got really well with him.

00:38:51.120 --> 00:38:52.240
 Very, very funny.

00:38:52.240 --> 00:38:53.080
 - Really?

00:38:53.080 --> 00:38:55.680
 - Did he demand the Vaseline for every shot?

00:38:55.680 --> 00:38:56.520
 - No.

00:38:56.520 --> 00:38:59.480
 (all laughing)

00:38:59.480 --> 00:39:01.680
 - Oh, just one interesting thing about Vaseline,

00:39:01.680 --> 00:39:03.920
 something else that it was very important

00:39:03.920 --> 00:39:06.080
 in the invention of was mascara.

00:39:06.080 --> 00:39:09.480
 So modern mascara was invented when a woman

00:39:09.480 --> 00:39:12.680
 called Mabel Williams, this was in 1915,

00:39:12.680 --> 00:39:14.760
 she sort of singed her eyebrows and eyelashes

00:39:14.760 --> 00:39:16.080
 in a kitchen fire.

00:39:16.080 --> 00:39:18.400
 And she wanted to make her eyelashes look longer again.

00:39:18.400 --> 00:39:20.160
 And so she came up with this homemade technique

00:39:20.160 --> 00:39:23.520
 of mixing ash and coal with Vaseline.

00:39:23.520 --> 00:39:27.440
 And then she applied her eyelashes and did the trick.

00:39:27.440 --> 00:39:29.800
 Her brother Tom, weirdly watching her,

00:39:29.800 --> 00:39:31.720
 watching her, spying on her

00:39:31.720 --> 00:39:34.080
 and decided to try and recreate this and commercialize it.

00:39:34.080 --> 00:39:35.600
 So he used a friend's chemistry set,

00:39:35.600 --> 00:39:38.600
 mixed it all together, made modern mascara

00:39:38.600 --> 00:39:40.600
 and named it after her, named it Maybelline.

00:39:40.600 --> 00:39:41.440
 - No, that's Maybelline?

00:39:41.440 --> 00:39:42.280
 That's your own Maybelline.

00:39:42.280 --> 00:39:43.120
 - Maybelline.

00:39:43.120 --> 00:39:43.960
 - That's really good.

00:39:43.960 --> 00:39:44.800
 That's great.

00:39:44.800 --> 00:39:45.880
 - Very cool.

00:39:45.880 --> 00:39:50.120
 So speaking of burns, there is one thing

00:39:50.120 --> 00:39:52.240
 that's used for treating burns

00:39:52.240 --> 00:39:57.240
 and that is poo shakes and that is like a milkshake

00:39:57.240 --> 00:39:59.120
 but it's made with poo.

00:39:59.120 --> 00:40:01.120
 And this is in New South Wales

00:40:01.120 --> 00:40:04.280
 and it's the Pot Macarie Koala Hospital.

00:40:04.280 --> 00:40:06.960
 Obviously they had a lot of fires in Australia recently

00:40:06.960 --> 00:40:09.000
 and love the koala's got burned.

00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:12.760
 And they found that by feeding them these poo milkshakes,

00:40:12.760 --> 00:40:15.560
 the koalas are getting better a lot quicker.

00:40:15.560 --> 00:40:19.400
 And it's basically your old gut bacteria thing.

00:40:19.400 --> 00:40:22.520
 So when you're a baby koala, you eat pap,

00:40:22.520 --> 00:40:25.600
 which is a mixture of digested half digested food

00:40:25.600 --> 00:40:28.480
 and bacteria is created in the mother's gut

00:40:28.480 --> 00:40:32.520
 and comes out through the seacum and the joey eats it.

00:40:32.520 --> 00:40:34.560
 And so what they're doing is they're trying to come up

00:40:34.560 --> 00:40:38.960
 with a way of imitating this by making these poo milkshakes

00:40:38.960 --> 00:40:40.680
 and they give them to the koalas

00:40:40.680 --> 00:40:42.520
 and it just helps them to put on weight.

00:40:42.520 --> 00:40:45.200
 It just helps them to get generally better

00:40:45.200 --> 00:40:47.240
 and that makes the burns heal more quickly.

00:40:47.240 --> 00:40:48.920
 - Okay, because it sort of builds up their immune system

00:40:48.920 --> 00:40:50.320
 against the burns.

00:40:50.320 --> 00:40:52.080
 - That's treating burns from the inside,

00:40:52.080 --> 00:40:53.400
 which is such a cool.

00:40:53.400 --> 00:40:54.240
 - Inside out.

00:40:54.240 --> 00:40:55.080
 - Yeah.

00:40:55.080 --> 00:40:59.240
 - My favourite burns, burns related story is,

00:40:59.240 --> 00:41:01.000
 which is in the 1940s.

00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:03.360
 And scientists wanted to come up with a pain scale.

00:41:03.360 --> 00:41:05.840
 They wanted to create the pain unit, the dull law.

00:41:05.840 --> 00:41:08.560
 And they decided the way they were going to do this,

00:41:08.560 --> 00:41:10.200
 where they were going to measure pain

00:41:10.200 --> 00:41:13.320
 and work out the scale was by taking women in labor

00:41:13.320 --> 00:41:15.640
 and then burning them repeatedly.

00:41:15.640 --> 00:41:17.600
 And then asking them to compare the sensation

00:41:17.600 --> 00:41:19.280
 of being burned to being in labor.

00:41:19.280 --> 00:41:21.480
 And the women were keen to do, they were interested.

00:41:21.480 --> 00:41:23.640
 They tended to be the wives of the doctors and the nurses.

00:41:23.640 --> 00:41:25.760
 They were like, yeah, fine, I'm gonna be in pain anyway.

00:41:25.760 --> 00:41:27.920
 And so they have these women who were in labor

00:41:27.920 --> 00:41:28.760
 going through contractions.

00:41:28.760 --> 00:41:31.040
 And then they just like burn their finger with a lighter

00:41:31.040 --> 00:41:33.880
 and say, how bad is that compared to your contraction?

00:41:33.880 --> 00:41:37.080
 And they were gonna be like, yeah, it's about the same.

00:41:37.080 --> 00:41:38.120
 And then it got worse and worse.

00:41:38.120 --> 00:41:39.520
 And they found they said that the problem was

00:41:39.520 --> 00:41:40.720
 that as contractions progressed,

00:41:40.720 --> 00:41:42.920
 the women became less good at coherently describing

00:41:42.920 --> 00:41:44.320
 their feelings.

00:41:44.320 --> 00:41:46.080
 So the researchers had to make inferences

00:41:46.080 --> 00:41:48.280
 about their pain based on their behavior.

00:41:48.280 --> 00:41:51.040
 So I think when she told me to go fuck myself,

00:41:51.040 --> 00:41:53.360
 I'll put that down as a tab.

00:41:53.360 --> 00:41:56.600
 [LAUGHTER]

00:41:56.600 --> 00:41:58.040
 But that's amazing.

00:41:58.040 --> 00:42:01.240
 Is the idea a bit like how, you know, if you have a splinter

00:42:01.240 --> 00:42:03.880
 and then you break your ankle, you forget about the splinter.

00:42:03.880 --> 00:42:05.120
 Is it that kind of thing?

00:42:05.120 --> 00:42:06.560
 It's not that idea.

00:42:06.560 --> 00:42:08.920
 The idea was that they thought that going,

00:42:08.920 --> 00:42:10.720
 the peak of labor was maximum pain.

00:42:10.720 --> 00:42:12.520
 So that would be max on the scale.

00:42:12.520 --> 00:42:14.800
 And then they wanted the women to quantify, be like,

00:42:14.800 --> 00:42:18.640
 all that burn is about a tenth as bad as the labor pain I've just felt.

00:42:18.640 --> 00:42:22.800
 But women got less and less good at perfectly rationalizing that pain.

00:42:22.800 --> 00:42:25.600
 Do you know, before QI was a thing,

00:42:25.600 --> 00:42:29.480
 I saw a little email group, six of us, they were in the group.

00:42:29.480 --> 00:42:33.640
 And we said this thing called the quite boring challenge.

00:42:33.640 --> 00:42:34.360
 Do you know this story?

00:42:34.360 --> 00:42:34.960
 No.

00:42:34.960 --> 00:42:37.480
 And the idea was one of us would nominate every week

00:42:37.480 --> 00:42:40.560
 a subject about which nothing interesting was or could be known.

00:42:40.560 --> 00:42:41.320
 OK.

00:42:41.320 --> 00:42:43.480
 And I started an I nominated Chumford,

00:42:43.480 --> 00:42:45.840
 because I grew up from near Chumford.

00:42:45.840 --> 00:42:47.880
 And I spent a week researching Chumford.

00:42:47.880 --> 00:42:50.240
 It was a fascinating facts I came up with.

00:42:50.240 --> 00:42:57.120
 And one of them is this, is that largest burns unit in Europe is in Chumford, in S6.

00:42:57.120 --> 00:43:01.960
 And for 30 years, the Conservative MP for Chumford was Simon Burns.

00:43:01.960 --> 00:43:03.160
 Oh, great.

00:43:03.160 --> 00:43:03.680
 OK.

00:43:03.680 --> 00:43:05.800
 Yeah, he was knighted in 2015.

00:43:05.800 --> 00:43:09.040
 He's the second cousin of David Bowie, of Bizarre.

00:43:09.040 --> 00:43:13.280
 But because he was educated at Worcester College, Oxford, where he got a third,

00:43:13.280 --> 00:43:16.280
 he's known by his friends as third-degree burns.

00:43:16.280 --> 00:43:21.520
 No, it's amazing when those QI facts come together.

00:43:21.520 --> 00:43:28.920
 OK, that's it.

00:43:28.920 --> 00:43:30.000
 That is all of our facts.

00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:31.400
 Thank you so much for listening.

00:43:31.400 --> 00:43:34.440

 I'm on @Streiberland, James.

00:43:40.080 --> 00:43:41.400
 Ah, James Harkin.

 You can email podcasts at QI.com.

00:43:44.280 --> 00:43:45.280
 Yep.

00:43:45.280 --> 00:43:47.040
 And John, you're not on it either.

00:43:47.040 --> 00:43:47.640
 I like Anna.

00:43:47.640 --> 00:43:48.720
 I'm in social media at all.

00:43:48.720 --> 00:43:49.520
 Yeah, you too.

00:43:49.520 --> 00:43:50.040
 Copycat.

00:43:50.040 --> 00:43:56.080
 You can go to our group account and no such thing, or you can go to our website.

00:43:56.080 --> 00:43:57.920
 No such thing as a fish.com.

00:43:57.920 --> 00:44:00.480
 We have everything up there from all of our previous episodes.

00:44:00.480 --> 00:44:04.200
 We have links to our behind-the-scenes documentary.

00:44:04.200 --> 00:44:07.760
 And actually, before we go, we're going to play out with a nice little song,

00:44:07.760 --> 00:44:11.120
 because, John, you're now at the manager of a band waiting for Smith.

00:44:11.120 --> 00:44:11.880
 Yeah.

00:44:11.880 --> 00:44:13.360
 And we've got their single here.

00:44:13.360 --> 00:44:13.880
 Yeah.

00:44:13.880 --> 00:44:14.880
 So I am the manager.

00:44:14.880 --> 00:44:16.040
 My name is Brian Ego.

00:44:16.040 --> 00:44:18.000
 Lovely boy is very talented.

00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:21.080
 And their latest single is called "So Much Love".

00:44:21.080 --> 00:44:21.560
 OK.

00:44:21.560 --> 00:44:23.280
 Well, we'll see you all again next week.

00:44:23.280 --> 00:44:24.720
 And the player's out now.

00:44:24.720 --> 00:44:25.680
 It's waiting for Smith.

00:44:25.680 --> 00:44:26.920
 We're so much love.
