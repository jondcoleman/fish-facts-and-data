1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:17,000
 - Hello and welcome to another episode

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,680
 of No Such Thing as a Fish,

4
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:20,240
 a weekly podcast coming to you

5
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:23,320
 from four undisclosed locations in the UK.

6
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:24,480
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

7
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:27,440
 I am sitting here with James Harkin, Anna Tijinski

8
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:28,720
 and Andrew Hunter Murray.

9
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:31,240
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones

10
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:34,280
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days

11
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:37,120
 and in no particular order, here we go.

12
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,040
 Starting with you, James.

13
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:42,520
 - Okay, my fact this week is that in 1948,

14
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:47,000
 a drive-through fly-through cinema opened in New Jersey

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,840
 where you could watch movies from the seat of your car

16
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:52,600
 or the seat of your small aircraft.

17
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:54,200
 - That's great.

18
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:56,000
 - Okay, so a couple of things to say

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,240
 before we get into this.

20
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:59,840
 Number one is that most of the following material

21
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,000
 that you're about to hear from me

22
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,440
 comes from an amazing book

23
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:05,760
 called The History of Driving Theatres by Kerry Seagrave.

24
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,440
 And secondly, this fact would have made a lot more sense

25
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:10,360
 if it had been in its original setting,

26
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:11,960
 which was in a drive-in show

27
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:13,920
 that we were supposed to do this week.

28
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,000
 - Yes, yeah, this episode was meant to be

29
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,440
 in one very disclosed location

30
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:22,000
 and unfortunately got canceled.

31
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,800
 - Sorry about that, everyone.

32
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:25,440
 - Yeah, much apologies. - Not our fault.

33
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:27,880
 - Not our fault, but you're going to get the facts anyway.

34
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:28,840
 - I think we can pretend.

35
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:29,960
 Guys, we can pretend.

36
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:31,640
 We can just all pretend we're in a car.

37
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:32,920
 The people at home won't know.

38
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:35,280
 - Andy, we weren't supposed to be in a car

39
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:36,560
 when we were doing the show.

40
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,240
 It was the audience that were in a car.

41
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:39,880
 We were supposed to be on the stage.

42
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:42,240
 - I was going to bring my car to the stage

43
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,960
 and then just sit in there.

44
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:47,520
 So this fly-through,

45
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,360
 did you have planes and cars next to each other?

46
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,640
 - The planes were behind the cars.

47
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,480
 - That makes sense,

48
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:55,320
 because if the planes were in front of the cars,

49
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:58,000
 then it's a raw deal if you're sitting in your car, isn't it?

50
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,400
 Just looking at the arse of a plane.

51
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,600
 - If it's a 747 or something like that,

52
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,080
 you don't want to climb in front of you.

53
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:06,400
 But this was organized by a guy called Edward Brown Jr.,

54
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,360
 who was a former Navy pilot,

55
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:12,120
 and his drive-in had capacity for 500 cars

56
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:15,360
 and then 25 aeroplanes on the last couple of rows.

57
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,880
 And what would happen is you would fly

58
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:20,760
 into a nearby airfield and then you would taxi into the,

59
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:24,320
 not get a taxi, you would drive the plane on its wheels

60
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:25,960
 into the last row of the theater,

61
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:28,560
 and then afterwards a jeep would tow you back

62
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,640
 to the airfield and you'd be able to fly off again.

63
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:33,920
 And the charge for the aeroplanes was 25 cents.

64
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,040
 - Wow. - That's extraordinary.

65
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:38,040
 I guess this was a bit more in the time

66
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:41,500
 when your average Joe sometimes had a plane.

67
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:46,680
 People sort of did a bit more in the '40s, didn't they?

68
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:49,240
 They did like a small piece together aeroplanes.

69
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,640
 I think it was much, much more common.

70
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:51,480
 Like people used to,

71
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:54,160
 you used to have hobbyists who would do sort of trick flights

72
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:57,760
 in and out of sheds and stuff, but still very weird.

73
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,200
 Although I read that it sort of caught on,

74
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:02,440
 so it must have had a few people going

75
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:05,160
 because a few more popped up in the subsequent years, right,

76
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,840
 in like Alabama and Texas.

77
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:09,160
 - Yeah, some of them opened by the same guy.

78
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:12,160
 So I don't know if that's a huge mark of success.

79
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:15,680
 - You don't open up a second drive-through fly-through

80
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,240
 unless your first one was successful.

81
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,480
 - Yeah, absolutely, yeah.

82
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,320
 - That's true.

83
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:22,040
 But he really, it was quite exciting what he did

84
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:25,280
 because he bought this land and he turned the whole,

85
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:28,040
 so he set up the airport, he set up the drive-through.

86
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:32,160
 He bulldozed everything in the way using a World War I tank

87
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:35,800
 and it also had a sort of gulf range next to it

88
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,960
 and an amusement park and playground.

89
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:38,800
 - There was a great article

90
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:41,000
 by someone called Mary Morley Cohen on this.

91
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,360
 And I'm just gonna list the extra things

92
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:44,680
 that one particular drive-in had, okay?

93
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:48,040
 It had a playground, pony rides, a dance floor,

94
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:50,440
 shuffleboard and horseshoe pitching tournaments,

95
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:53,560
 cartoon carnivals, midnight spook shows,

96
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:56,000
 baby parades and beautiful child contests,

97
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,800
 daredevil car rides, circus acts,

98
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:00,840
 high tower dives, anniversary and birthday celebrations,

99
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,880
 fireworks, a picnic and play area,

100
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:05,560
 potato sack races and television.

101
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:10,000
 - That's just extra TV in case you're bored of the film,

102
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:10,840
 I guess.

103
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,120
 - That's amazing.

104
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:15,680
 There was one in Memphis where you could get your laundry done

105
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,240
 when you went to the drive-in.

106
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:19,960
 So you turn up with your laundry, hand it in

107
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:21,200
 and then they clean it for you.

108
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,760
 And as you left, you'd pick it up.

109
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:24,040
 - That's so good.

110
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:26,760
 - It's almost like the films just weren't the main attraction.

111
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:28,960
 And I think someone did an experiment

112
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,160
 'cause they thought actually,

113
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,480
 are people even coming to see the films?

114
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:35,200
 And so they didn't advertise what film was showing

115
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,680
 and the same number of people showed up.

116
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,160
 And then they started interviewing people

117
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,160
 as they were driving in and said,

118
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,600
 "What film are you coming for?"

119
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:43,280
 And most people didn't know what film they were going to see.

120
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:46,400
 They're just kind of coming 'cause it's a thing to do.

121
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,400
 But I think the laundry thing was particularly interesting

122
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:52,240
 because that was about how one of the appeals of the drive-ins

123
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:55,160
 was that it appealed to a much broader audience.

124
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:57,760
 And so, for instance, one of the people they advertised to

125
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:00,880
 was mothers, housewives, because you could bring your kids.

126
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,840
 So the idea was you didn't have to find a babysitter

127
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:05,440
 to leave them at home, brought your kids along.

128
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:08,120
 They also specifically advertised to disabled people

129
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,200
 because you can stay in your car.

130
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:12,000
 You don't have to get up and maneuver into a seat.

131
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,120
 And they advertised specifically to obese people

132
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,280
 at the start, didn't they?

133
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:18,360
 I think one of the very first adverts

134
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,240
 from the guy who invented the drive-in

135
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,960
 was a picture of an overweight lady

136
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,560
 trying to squeeze into a cinema seat.

137
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,840
 And then it said something like,

138
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:28,360
 "Kate doesn't have any problem at the drive-in."

139
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,760
 - So she was called Kate Smith,

140
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:32,120
 the lady who was in that image.

141
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,800
 And she was a really famous singer

142
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:36,280
 and she was like the South America's version

143
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:37,760
 of Dame Vera Lynn.

144
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:39,720
 So she was really big during the war

145
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,560
 and she sang a load of amazing songs

146
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:43,920
 and everyone got really patriotic about her.

147
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:48,160
 And she was also, she sang for the Philadelphia Flyers.

148
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,560
 So before the game, before every game,

149
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,440
 she would sing "God Bless America."

150
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:55,760
 And whenever she sang, they almost always won.

151
00:05:55,760 --> 00:06:00,080
 They had a record of 100 wins and 29 losses

152
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,040
 and five ties whenever she sang.

153
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:04,160
 And normally it was more like 50/50.

154
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,120
 So all the other teams really hated her

155
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:09,200
 because she was just this amazingly good mascot

156
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,040
 for that team.

157
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:12,040
 But yeah, she was super famous Kate Smith.

158
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,360
 - I feel terrible.

159
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,080
 - I've described her as just an overweight lady

160
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:16,440
 trying to squeeze into her cinema seat.

161
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:18,000
 And she's basically the lovely charm

162
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,800
 of the whole United States.

163
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:20,800
 I'm so sorry.

164
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,160
 - But so that was the reason, wasn't it,

165
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:25,120
 for the whole invention of the drive-in.

166
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:28,680
 It was 1933, a guy called Richard Hollingshead

167
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:29,800
 was living in New Jersey

168
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:32,880
 and his mother found cinema seats uncomfortable

169
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,040
 and he wanted to fix that.

170
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:36,080
 So he thought if she could watch it

171
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,680
 from the comfort of her car,

172
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,240
 this would be a much better system.

173
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:41,800
 So he rigged up a sort of system

174
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,200
 for her to test it out on

175
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:45,320
 and it's so clever, these sort of innovation

176
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:47,400
 that he did in the early days.

177
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,880
 Once he had the idea that this could be commercial,

178
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:51,880
 the thought of, okay, how do I deal with it

179
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:53,200
 if it's raining, for example?

180
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,600
 So he would have his water hose

181
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:57,200
 and sprinkler systems going off in the background

182
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,800
 while he tested different ways.

183
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,000
 He thought if cars were gonna be parked behind each other,

184
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,020
 how could they see each other?

185
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:04,640
 So he tested out these sort of ramp systems

186
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:07,560
 whereby he could levitate, not levitate.

187
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,600
 - Oh no, no, no, he couldn't levitate.

188
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:12,240
 That would be an amazing innovation, wasn't it?

189
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,880
 When Guardian love your search.

190
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:17,440
 - That's the helicopter driving your thinking of, Dan.

191
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,760
 Just on bringing your kids, this is a really clever thing

192
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:22,320
 and how it was advertised.

193
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:25,360
 Lots of cinemas put the playground for the children

194
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,040
 'cause the children might not want to sit and watch the film.

195
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,960
 They put the playground under the screen.

196
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:31,160
 So as you were watching the film as a parent,

197
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:33,200
 you could just check in and see your kids

198
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:35,440
 directly beneath the cinema screen.

199
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,520
 - That's so good.

200
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:39,240
 - Although actually not everyone was happy about this idea

201
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,680
 that you could bring your kids

202
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:45,120
 because in 1947, there was a picket outside one

203
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:48,440
 of the drive-ins by a load of babysitters

204
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:53,440
 who said, "Down with drive-ins, more work for babysitters."

205
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:57,720
 And while you drive in movie theaters, babysitters starve.

206
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:01,120
 And so they were outside saying, "Down with drive-ins."

207
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,040
 - Wow. - Because they were losing money.

208
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:03,880
 - That's amazing. - It feels like

209
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:05,040
 they've kind of won now.

210
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:07,880
 It feels like babysitters have remained culturally necessary

211
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:09,400
 in a way that drive-ins kind of haven't.

212
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,680
 - That's true. - Yeah.

213
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:13,200
 - Have you ever heard of another babysitter robot?

214
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:15,360
 (all laughing)

215
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,360
 - Is that unique?

216
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:18,560
 - They're not very heavily unionized, the babysitters.

217
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,640
 (all laughing)

218
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:22,240
 - I think if I was a babysitter,

219
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:27,240
 I would be really angry with recipe box services.

220
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,760
 Because when I was a babysitter,

221
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:31,880
 what you'd get is free reign of whatever was in the fridge.

222
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:33,640
 But with those recipe boxes,

223
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:35,800
 you only get exactly what you have to cook.

224
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:37,200
 So there's never any spare food.

225
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:40,000
 So it means babysitters are starving in that case.

226
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:40,840
 - All right, James.

227
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:43,160
 As an outfit that does some of the advertised hello fresh,

228
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:45,440
 I don't know if we need to be putting babysitters off it,

229
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,440
 driving a wedge between them.

230
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:51,360
 - Well, these babysitters anyway, in near Seattle,

231
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,400
 they picked it for a while,

232
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:55,840
 but then they were bought off with a free movie and a hot dog.

233
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,600
 - Wow. (all laughing)

234
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,600
 - So cheekily bought.

235
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,440
 - I think that's what they were going for.

236
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,280
 - It could be.

237
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:04,720
 - I don't think driving movies have ever been popular enough

238
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,920
 that they've been putting babysitters out of business

239
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:08,040
 on mass.

240
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:10,240
 I think they just wanted a free film.

241
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,240
 - You know, we know what the first movie was

242
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:15,160
 to play the drive-in, which is quite cool.

243
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:17,000
 So this was in 1933.

244
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,600
 It's a movie called "Wives Beware".

245
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:23,400
 And it is the story of a man who tires of married life

246
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,720
 and he feigns memory loss

247
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:28,560
 so that he can then pursue other women.

248
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:29,760
 That's the whole plot.

249
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:30,680
 So when his wife's like,

250
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:32,240
 "Hey, you slept with that lady."

251
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,320
 He goes, "Did I?"

252
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,160
 That's weird.

253
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:37,440
 And that was the movie.

254
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,680
 And the reason they had that movie,

255
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:40,440
 and this became the thing for drive-throughs,

256
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:43,680
 was this was a movie that played in cinemas for one week

257
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,480
 and then it went off cinemas.

258
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:48,400
 And drive-throughs specifically were playing films

259
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:50,800
 that were not in competition with the cinema.

260
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:53,400
 It was the movies that were no longer on screen there.

261
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:56,080
 And actually the popularity of it started dwindling

262
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:58,800
 to more B movies and then erotic movies.

263
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,160
 - But I think one of the reasons was as well though, Dan,

264
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:02,720
 is that there was quite a union

265
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:05,840
 between all of the different movie-making studios

266
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:08,600
 and then America smashed it and whenever it was,

267
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,240
 the '40s or '50s or something like that.

268
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:13,760
 But before then, basically, if you weren't in on it,

269
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,480
 you couldn't get the best movies.

270
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:18,760
 And so all of the theaters really wanted to stop the drive-ins

271
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:19,920
 from getting the best movies

272
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,800
 'cause they thought that everyone would go to the drive-ins

273
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:24,000
 instead of going to the theaters, I think.

274
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,240
 - Yeah, I think they were more forced into the position,

275
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,080
 weren't they?

276
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:29,520
 Because no one would actually sell them the popular release.

277
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:32,800
 And like Anna says, no one really cared what was on, right?

278
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,000
 - No, they just went there to snog.

279
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,280
 - They just went there to snog.

280
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:38,440
 So there was a real big problem.

281
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:41,280
 It wasn't just the baby sisters who didn't like the drive-ins.

282
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:44,800
 It was also the puritanical people

283
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:47,640
 'cause they were worried about nekkers.

284
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:49,920
 So when the first one opened in Camden,

285
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,680
 this first one, Hollingshead's one,

286
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,560
 that we were talking about, a writer noted,

287
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:55,720
 "Perhaps it will occur readily enough to the reader

288
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,880
 "what fun young America could have

289
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:00,280
 "in a coop under the added stimulation

290
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:02,560
 "of a sophisticated romance."

291
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,080
 So that was the first one that came

292
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,200
 and they were already saying

293
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:08,520
 that people might be snogging in the cars.

294
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:11,200
 - They were very paranoid, weren't they?

295
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:14,440
 - They were quite paranoid, but I mean, it did happen.

296
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,840
 - Oh yeah, a lot of snogging went on.

297
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:17,760
 - Yeah, one of the owners said,

298
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,400
 "The only thing that can slow us down

299
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:21,160
 "is an ugly rumour going around

300
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:23,800
 "that the drive-in are perfect for nekkers."

301
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:26,160
 - They did have people go around checking, didn't they?

302
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,440
 - Checking for necking.

303
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,560
 - They had necker checkers, yeah.

304
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:31,280
 So a lot of them employed policemen

305
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:33,120
 or just members of staff who had to go around

306
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,880
 and look in people's windows

307
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:37,760
 'cause they got this reputation as being passion pits.

308
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:41,080
 And the reputation was from people called blue noses,

309
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,120
 which I'd never heard before,

310
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:46,440
 but it's a term for sort of prudish church types in America.

311
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:49,440
 And various drive-ins would have rules

312
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,440
 about what was allowed,

313
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:53,040
 so one owner of a drive-in specified,

314
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:56,080
 if a man puts his arm around a woman, that's okay,

315
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:58,960
 but if she puts her arm back around him

316
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:02,320
 and then they go into a clinch, that's out.

317
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,720
 And then they're removed from the premises.

318
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,360
 So that's where the line is.

319
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:10,480
 - There was an actual law against it in 1972 in New Jersey,

320
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,920
 which would find the operator $100

321
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:14,840
 if any cars remained on the premises

322
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:17,240
 one hour after the end of the show.

323
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:19,200
 And they said that the reason was

324
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:23,440
 because they didn't want any carbon monoxide deaths,

325
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,840
 but actually it was just to stop the neckers.

326
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:29,320
 - If you can't get your necking done within an hour, then, you know.

327
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:31,320
 - I genuinely didn't know what the word "necking" meant,

328
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:35,200
 so I Googled it, and apparently it's a short, plain, concave section

329
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,640
 between the capital and the shaft

330
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:39,120
 of a classical Doric-Ortuskin column,

331
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,960
 but just in case people were hearing.

332
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:46,800
 - You probably need a third person to be in the car with you

333
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,000
 to not be caught out for necking, right?

334
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,040
 Because it's hard to see what's going on around you

335
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:55,040
 when you're kissing, and generally,

336
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:58,960
 kissing sort of etiquette means you have to have your eyes closed.

337
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:01,320
 So if you had your eyes open while kissing,

338
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:04,640
 A, you risk being a weirdo, but you are safer, I guess.

339
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:06,720
 - If the other person has their eyes open as well,

340
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:09,080
 then they're a weirdo, so you can usually get away with it

341
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,440
 because they have their eyes closed.

342
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:12,560
 - You're right, one person has to have their eyes open at all times

343
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,360
 looking for blue noses,

344
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:17,000
 and the other person gets on with removing their neckers.

345
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,720
 - Well, no, you need both with eyes open because all you're getting

346
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:23,520
 is you're getting that window only of your position.

347
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:25,960
 - You can have a mini Periscope installed in the car,

348
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:28,520
 and then you can just see all the way around you at all times.

349
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:30,640
 - Oh, that's cool. In which case, you only need one eye open.

350
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:32,960
 - I don't want to be a female in the car with you, Andy,

351
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:34,640
 when you say Periscope up.

352
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:36,880
 (laughing)

353
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:40,920
 The second ever drive-in was built by a man called

354
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,520
 Wilson Shankwaila.

355
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:44,480
 It was, wow.

356
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:47,160
 He was from Pennsylvania,

357
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:51,960
 and they tried to stop it by taxing him,

358
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:55,560
 and so they wanted to give him a massive amusement tax,

359
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:58,560
 and he tried to avoid it by advertising it as

360
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:01,400
 free movies parking 50 cents.

361
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:04,240
 So it was like, he advertised it as just a parking lot

362
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,680
 that just happens to have free movies happening.

363
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:08,040
 - That's what he did.

364
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:10,200
 - Shankwaila is another activity that was banned.

365
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:12,440
 (laughing)

366
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:18,440
 - Okay, it is time for fact number two, and that is my fact.

367
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:21,280
 My fact this week is that the Beatles once rejected

368
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:25,040
 a 50 million pound reunion gig because the Warm-Up Act

369
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:28,560
 was going to be a man wrestling a great white shark.

370
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,680
 This is according to Ringo Starr,

371
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:33,160
 who revealed this in an interview recently

372
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:35,280
 in the lead-up to his 80th birthday,

373
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:38,440
 and he was talking about how back in 1975,

374
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:42,480
 they were approached by a incredible character

375
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:46,680
 called Bill Sargent, who wanted to reunite them,

376
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:48,680
 and he had 50 million pounds,

377
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:51,440
 which is roughly 200 million pounds in today's money,

378
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,600
 and the idea was for them to do this gig,

379
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,480
 and according to the Beatles,

380
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:58,400
 the pitch was that it was going to be a Warm-Up Act

381
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:00,840
 of a man underwater fighting a shark.

382
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:04,760
 Now, I think Ringo's muddled this story a bit.

383
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:06,400
 I don't think that great white shark

384
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,640
 was going to be the Warm-Up Act.

385
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:08,960
 However, Bill Sargent--

386
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:11,440
 - No, you put the great white shark on last.

387
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,200
 - Of course, there's no way the Beatles

388
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:15,200
 can follow a man fighting a shark.

389
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:17,000
 It's going to be such a letdown for the audience.

390
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,560
 Even the Beatles reuniting.

391
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:19,840
 - You've got a man with a shark,

392
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:22,120
 and then some people saying, "I am a walrus."

393
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:23,760
 Come on.

394
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,400
 - Octopus' garden.

395
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:26,680
 Now, desperately trying to think of--

396
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:28,320
 they would have needed a yellow submarine

397
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:31,120
 in order to get to the stage.

398
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:33,320
 I can play this all night.

399
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:34,520
 - OK, we can wait.

400
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:35,960
 I'll leave for another one.

401
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:38,840
 [laughter]

402
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:41,200
 Also, I'm not sure he had 50 million dollars,

403
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:43,520
 'cause he was like the father of pay-per-view, wasn't he?

404
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:46,000
 So his idea was that he would put it on,

405
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,920
 and then people would pay to watch it,

406
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,800
 and then the Beatles would get the money from that one day.

407
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,640
 - Oh. - I think so.

408
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:53,200
 - I see. - But he said--

409
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:55,600
 there was an interview with him in 1976,

410
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,800
 and he said, "I definitely asked them to do this,

411
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:00,200
 and as far as I know, they're considering it."

412
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:02,800
 But he said that the problem was that Paul McCartney

413
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,760
 was about to start a US tour,

414
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:07,960
 a 20-day US tour that was going to be huge for McCartney,

415
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:11,560
 and that it was because he didn't want to bring the Beatles

416
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:14,000
 back together quite yet that it didn't happen.

417
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
 That was quite a sergeant.

418
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,200
 James, I don't know if we read the same thing about Bill Sargent.

419
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:21,600
 I was reading People magazine from 1976.

420
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,320
 - Same article. - Nice.

421
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:25,560
 I reckon probably about 15 years,

422
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:27,000
 no one else has read that article,

423
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,720
 and then four people read it this week.

424
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,280
 [laughter]

425
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:32,320
 The People and People magazine are going to be so excited

426
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,400
 by the sudden boost.

427
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:35,520
 Yeah. Do you think the office, there was a ping noise

428
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:37,080
 that went on four times?

429
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:39,000
 [laughter]

430
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,000
 But it was so funny, 'cause it reported that this guy,

431
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,400
 Bill Sargent, had made and lost a million dollars

432
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:46,600
 seven times over, and he'd also had two heart attacks.

433
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:49,160
 And then it said, "As of now, the Beatles seem more likely

434
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:51,440
 to provide Sargent with coronary number three

435
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,200
 than fortune number eight."

436
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:56,240
 Yeah, and actually, the guy who bought the Great Work Shark,

437
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,760
 I think, might have caused another coronary,

438
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:01,760
 because that was also supposed to happen

439
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:04,000
 as a pay-per-view thing, and they even made the posters

440
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
 and everything, but Bill Sargent had a heart attack

441
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,560
 before they could do it, and so they...

442
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:09,200
 - Oh, yeah. - Yeah.

443
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:12,760
 I actually found the press release that they issued

444
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:16,880
 to companies around the world about this big fight,

445
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,640
 and it's remarkable reading.

446
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,160
 It's about six pages long.

447
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:22,960
 It's written in such great, so in the most unusual,

448
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:25,160
 deaf-defying event ever to come to the screen,

449
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:27,600
 Bill Sargent has announced that he will bring a life fight

450
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:29,120
 to the death between a single man

451
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:31,120
 and a giant live man-eating shark

452
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:33,520
 to theater, arena, and coliseum screens

453
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,960
 by satellite closed-circuit television.

454
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:38,360
 And it was a guy called Wally Gibbons,

455
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:40,280
 who was a shark expert,

456
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:43,240
 and he was gonna be given a spear,

457
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:45,880
 and that is how he was gonna fight the shark.

458
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:47,280
 And the sharks, three of them,

459
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:49,720
 were gonna be brought five weeks early to Samoa,

460
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:51,480
 where the fight was gonna occur,

461
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:53,760
 so they could acclimatize to the water,

462
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:56,920
 and in the 48 hours leading up to the fight,

463
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:58,640
 they were gonna be starved.

464
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:02,280
 So Wally was gonna have to fight a starving shark,

465
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:05,200
 and he said a lot about, in this press release,

466
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:07,200
 about what he thought his odds were of surviving.

467
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:10,280
 He thought if he could shoot the shark with the speargun

468
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:13,160
 first time and get him, that was gonna bring the odds up,

469
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:16,280
 but he needed to shoot it about five times to kill it.

470
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:19,000
 -But what about the two other sharks? -Yeah.

471
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,960
 -They were backup sharks. -They're holding the towel

472
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:23,400
 and the bucket and they're holding it.

473
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:25,560
 Can I ask you, Addy, if you're in the water,

474
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:27,400
 what are you keeping in the bucket?

475
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,400
 I don't know.

476
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:33,160
 I don't think it would have defied death.

477
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:34,880
 I think it would have really embraced death.

478
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,560
 I have a suspicion that old Wally, the absolute Wally,

479
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:39,680
 would have died within maybe five seconds.

480
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:41,120
 -Ah. -Because I don't think...

481
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,280
 -Do you think? -Yeah, I think so, because...

482
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:44,280
 I don't know.

483
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:47,120
 I think that he tried this a few times,

484
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:49,160
 because there was someone called Geoffrey Mann,

485
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:52,600
 who wrote a book later in life about Bill Sargent

486
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:55,080
 trying to get him to fight a shark in Samoa as well,

487
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:57,680
 which you've got to assume is the same kind of setup.

488
00:18:57,680 --> 00:19:00,800
 And apparently that was cancelled, according to this guy,

489
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:03,480
 cancelled last minute by Jack Cousteau,

490
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:06,720
 who... I don't know what he was doing, being involved in the event,

491
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:09,280
 but a famed oceanographer, Jack Cousteau,

492
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,320
 cancelled this shark fight.

493
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:13,400
 But he was going to have a knife,

494
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:15,360
 which I think is going to be quite similar to a spear.

495
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:18,120
 And in the end, I was looking up how you'd kill a shark

496
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:19,760
 if you faced it.

497
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:23,080
 And stabbing it is the worst possible thing you can do,

498
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:24,680
 according to a guy called William Johnson.

499
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:27,160
 It's not the worst. The worst thing is to climb into its mouth.

500
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:28,160
 Yeah.

501
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:30,720
 He actually does say, when he's giving advice, he says,

502
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:33,160
 "Go for the face and gills, because they're quite sensitive."

503
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:34,840
 So, you know, like punching them in the face.

504
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:37,080
 But do try to keep your hands out of its mouth.

505
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:38,680
 That's always the best thing.

506
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:41,400
 But Wally Gibbons was an interesting guy, wasn't he?

507
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:46,600
 Like, there was a 1952 contest between fishermen and spearmen,

508
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:49,640
 which were people who caught fish with spears.

509
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:53,600
 And he caught more fish than all the 37 fishermen

510
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,520
 who were in that competition on his own.

511
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:56,760
 Wow.

512
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:59,400
 He was amazing. And just after World War II,

513
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:01,800
 he swam around the Solomon Islands,

514
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:04,920
 picking up, like, unexploded shells,

515
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:07,520
 and then taking them away so that they wouldn't affect people

516
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:09,800
 in the future. Isn't that amazing, Wally?

517
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:11,640
 That's really cool. Yeah, he was incredible.

518
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:14,280
 There's a biography in this press release where they say

519
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:17,880
 that he has killed more sharks in man-to-fish underwater combat

520
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:21,680
 than any other man in Australia and possibly in the world.

521
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:25,640
 I mean, so, yeah, I find it unlikely that anyone from

522
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:28,080
 anywhere else in Australia would have killed any sharks

523
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:29,000
 in man-to-fish fights.

524
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,160
 And it should sign, probably, that.

525
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:32,600
 Yeah, he was known as a man-fish.

526
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:34,240
 That's what they called him.

527
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,840
 Merman. We've got a name for a mountain fish.

528
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:37,560
 It's a merman.

529
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:41,160
 Wally Gibbons also had the best collection of seashells

530
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:42,760
 in the whole of Australia.

531
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:45,200
 He had the world's rarest shell.

532
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,800
 He owned it, the Gloria Maris,

533
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:50,720
 which is also known as the Glory of the Seacone.

534
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:54,080
 And that shell used to be so rare

535
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:57,240
 that there was once a collector who bought one in an auction

536
00:20:57,240 --> 00:21:00,520
 only to immediately destroy it so that he had the only one

537
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:02,480
 because he found this other one that was...

538
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,920
 He didn't want two in the world to exist,

539
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:06,840
 so he bought one in the auction when it came up

540
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:09,040
 and he destroyed it, so he had the only one.

541
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:09,840
 That's pretty sick.

542
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,920
 Supposedly, that was in 1792.

543
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:14,960
 But then there was only a few of them in the world.

544
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:16,640
 Wally Gibbons had one of them.

545
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:20,800
 And when proper scuba diving got invented, they found...

546
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:22,080
 Oh, yeah, they're just down there.

547
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:24,680
 They were just a bit lower than we could normally go.

548
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:27,080
 So people, you can collect them quite easily now.

549
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:29,120
 You could buy them for not too much.

550
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:31,760
 I think that would be a disappointing

551
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,680
 if the shark fight couldn't go ahead.

552
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:36,200
 But he said, "But don't worry, Wally Gibbons

553
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:39,400
 "will be showing you his seashell collection."

554
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:42,880
 Because I was thinking, Anna said that he would die after five minutes.

555
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:44,640
 If you're the Beatles and you're thinking,

556
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:47,200
 "Okay, we're going on in an hour after the fight."

557
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,680
 And then after five minutes, they're like,

558
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:50,320
 "Well, sorry, the guy just got eaten,

559
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:51,640
 "so you're going to have to go on early."

560
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:52,920
 I'd be pretty pissed off.

561
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:55,880
 Also, there's a bit of a weird vibe in the audience right now.

562
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:58,280
 (LAUGHTER)

563
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:00,120
 They probably had a back-up, warmer-backed,

564
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:02,080
 which was a therapist to come out on stage

565
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:05,880
 to help everyone deal with the massacre they'd just seen.

566
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:09,240
 Can I just say one weird, interesting thing about Bill Sargent,

567
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:10,920
 the guy who Dan mentioned at the start,

568
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:12,800
 who was organising the shark fights.

569
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,960
 So he was an inventor. He invented tons of stuff.

570
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:18,720
 He had, I think, over 400 patents, so gadget patents.

571
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,720
 And one thing that I think he invented

572
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:23,960
 is something that we think of as new, which is televised theatre.

573
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:26,760
 So, you know, now you can go and see the National Theatre Live

574
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:28,160
 at your local cinema,

575
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:31,200
 or you could before the theatre stopped happening.

576
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,400
 And he invented the precursor to this called

577
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:36,840
 "Electronovision" in the 1960s.

578
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:40,720
 And so, basically, it involved him going in and videotaping plays

579
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:43,000
 and then broadcasting them in cinemas.

580
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,560
 And he made loads of money out of it.

581
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:49,440
 And the first one he did was a tape of Richard Burton in Hamlet in 1964.

582
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:50,920
 And he filmed three separate productions,

583
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:53,640
 then edited them together to get the best best of.

584
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:58,280
 Highlights showed in 1,000 cinemas and made him millions of dollars.

585
00:22:58,280 --> 00:22:59,280
 Amazing.

586
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:01,840
 Bill Sargent's first job was a radio repairman,

587
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:04,200
 which he had at the age of six.

588
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:07,160
 - Wow. - So he started work at the age of six.

589
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:09,400
 In fairness, it was in the family workshop,

590
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:11,680
 which was attached to his family home.

591
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:15,000
 Unfortunately, a year later, he burnt them both down by accident.

592
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,040
 And then later on, when he got a load of money for his movies,

593
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:20,920
 he set up an electronics laboratory in Missouri.

594
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:23,080
 But then he burned that down as well.

595
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:26,440
 So he had kind of had a habit of burning down electronic shops.

596
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:30,040
 That time, when he burned down the second one, James,

597
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:33,640
 apparently it was because he put down, just not really thinking,

598
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:36,280
 he put down a welding torch in the wrong place.

599
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:39,400
 He put it onto a drum of paint thinner or thinner.

600
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:42,320
 So kind of the winch is obviously highly flammable.

601
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:44,240
 According, I guess, to him,

602
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:45,880
 because I don't think there were many other people around,

603
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:48,760
 he was blown 170 feet into the air.

604
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:53,280
 - What's 170 feet? - No.

605
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:56,320
 - That's impossible. - Someone's flying over to the drive-in fare

606
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:57,840
 to go, "What the fuck was that?"

607
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:01,840
 (LAUGHTER)

608
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:04,320
 - 170 feet. - Yep, that's what he says.

609
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:05,320
 Well...

610
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:07,440
 I love him. Love this man so much.

611
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:10,000
 So this thing of a man fighting a shark

612
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,800
 was basically an insane, weird, warm-up act.

613
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:16,000
 And so I looked into a few other weird acts,

614
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,160
 like kind of vaudeville acts from, you know, the last century.

615
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:21,360
 So have you heard of Haji Ali,

616
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:23,840
 who was also known as the Egyptian enigma?

617
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:25,760
 - Oh? - He was amazing.

618
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,360
 OK, so he was a vaudeville performer.

619
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:30,600
 His act was to swallow kerosene,

620
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:33,160
 then he would swallow some water, OK?

621
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:35,360
 Then he would regurgitate the kerosene

622
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:37,960
 and set it on fire, as he did so.

623
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:41,560
 But then he would regurgitate the water to put out the fire

624
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:43,520
 that he had lit from the kerosene.

625
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:46,240
 - So cool. - I think he was also known as the human volcano.

626
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:47,480
 Or something like that.

627
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:49,120
 And then there's just one line about him saying

628
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:52,040
 he would also regurgitate live goldfish and nuts.

629
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:54,640
 (LAUGHTER)

630
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:57,480
 The nuts was actually more impressive than it sounds, wasn't it,

631
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:59,280
 with Haji Ali, because he...

632
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:01,280
 One of his tricks was being able to regurgitate stuff

633
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:03,080
 in the order specified by the audience.

634
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:05,040
 So he'd swallow a bunch of objects and then be like,

635
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:08,120
 "All right, bring up the goldfish now. OK, bring up your braces."

636
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:11,840
 And so he'd swallow, for instance, 50 hazelnuts

637
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:13,840
 and one almond.

638
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:16,040
 And he'd start regurgitating them one by one.

639
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:18,920
 And when an audience member said, "Bring up the almond now, mate,"

640
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:20,840
 he'd call the almond up.

641
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:22,840
 - And within. - It's amazing.

642
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:24,520
 - Apparently. - Oh, my God.

643
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:27,880
 I genuinely think if you gave me a bowl of nuts

644
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:29,640
 and said, "Which one of those is an almond?"

645
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:30,640
 I would struggle.

646
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:31,840
 (LAUGHTER)

647
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:33,640
 Maybe that's what he was relying on.

648
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:35,800
 He just told the audience it was an almond.

649
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:37,040
 (LAUGHTER)

650
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:40,640
 I can say one more Borderville thing related to animals.

651
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,560
 And this was an amazing act,

652
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:45,480
 which was a group of women called the Barrison Sisters.

653
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:48,000
 And it seems like their entire act

654
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,560
 was to do a little bit of a sexy dance

655
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:52,200
 that gets more and more sexy.

656
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:54,080
 And all the way through, they would ask the audience,

657
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:56,240
 "Would you like to see my pussy?"

658
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:58,600
 And then when eventually, the audience said, "Yes,"

659
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:02,440
 they would lift their skirts and they would all have a cat in their knickers.

660
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:03,800
 (LAUGHTER)

661
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:07,040
 And that was absolutely massive.

662
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:08,680
 They were huge.

663
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:10,640
 They were so famous, these people.

664
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:14,040
 They played Berlin for eight months with this act.

665
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:16,040
 (LAUGHTER)

666
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:18,680
 - They played a... - But is it like the mousetrap, James?

667
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:21,440
 Are they like, "Please don't tell anyone the spoiler when you leave?"

668
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:23,840
 It must be, right? It must be that.

669
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:25,680
 They must have been exactly like that.

670
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:28,440
 And there was a French nobleman who committed suicide

671
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:30,560
 because he loved one of them so much.

672
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:33,680
 And they were so shocking that after the eight months in Berlin,

673
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:36,560
 they were banned from ever re-entering Germany.

674
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:39,440
 I love the fact that they waited eight months to ban them.

675
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:41,680
 It's like, "Okay, now that everyone in Germany

676
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:43,840
 "has had a chance to see you, now you're banned."

677
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:46,000
 Because now that's not appropriate.

678
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,320
 The censors went countless times, thousands of times.

679
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:51,280
 Yeah, we're just trying to assess whether or not

680
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:53,480
 it really is offensive enough to ban.

681
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:57,360
 Just like a few more months of seeing them, to be sure.

682
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:59,280
 - Were the cats alive? - Yeah, they were alive.

683
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:02,160
 They were in, like, a little pouch over their crutches.

684
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:06,160
 So the cats had to sit there in between their legs for the full act.

685
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:07,480
 - They must have been sedated. - Yeah.

686
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:10,800
 I don't know whether they regurgitated them somehow or what,

687
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:12,600
 but they were definitely there.

688
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:13,920
 And there was an article about them,

689
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:16,320
 and one guy in New York said,

690
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:19,960
 "It was the most audacious piece of devilry and abandonment

691
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:23,200
 "I ever saw offered to a New York public."

692
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:24,200
 Wow.

693
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:25,800
 I really thought you were going to say that he committed suicide

694
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:28,400
 because he was so disappointed when they lifted up their skirts

695
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:30,440
 at the end, and he didn't see their vaginas.

696
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:32,440
 Yeah.

697
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:35,440
 Just ask only a cat.

698
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:37,440
 It's all been for nothing.

699
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:42,880
 OK, it's time for fact number three, and that is Anna.

700
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:45,240
 My fact this week is that in 1919,

701
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:48,840
 it was ruled that women would be allowed to swim competitively

702
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:51,880
 without wearing stockings on the one condition

703
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:55,480
 that they quickly put on a robe as soon as they got out of the water.

704
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:59,280
 And this was specifically in America.

705
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:01,400
 And I think these are nylon stockings,

706
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:03,880
 because there weren't been any nylon in 1919, would they?

707
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:05,880
 So was it wool or what?

708
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:06,880
 I think they were wool.

709
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:10,280
 I think quite a lot of people had to wear woolen stuff in the water.

710
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:13,320
 That's not going to be conducive to a quick swim, is it?

711
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:15,520
 It's like carrying a sheep while you're swimming.

712
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:16,520
 Yeah.

713
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:19,240
 It's like that, did you guys all do that swimming survival test

714
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:21,280
 when you were younger, where you had to wear pyjamas in the water?

715
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:23,080
 It was like every time a woman swam in the water,

716
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:25,440
 it was like having to do that survival test.

717
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:27,520
 In every Olympics, they had to pick up a brick

718
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:29,560
 from the bottom of the pool, didn't they?

719
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:31,040
 Yeah.

720
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:35,120
 So this was in America, and it was the Amateur Athletics Union,

721
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:37,520
 which had only recently allowed women to take part

722
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:39,840
 in competitive swimming events anyway.

723
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:43,160
 But it was very controversial what women would wear in the water,

724
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:47,920
 and they essentially had to be covered from neck to toe fully.

725
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:49,440
 And this irritated the women,

726
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:52,640
 because they realised that this would put them at a massive disadvantage

727
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:53,920
 in the Olympics, for instance,

728
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:56,640
 when they were competing against other countries like Australia,

729
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,840
 who were a bit looser with their regulations,

730
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:03,360
 and they would be weighed down by their massive cotton waterlogs

731
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:06,560
 and head-to-toe outfits while the Aussies were smashing them.

732
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:08,920
 So there was sort of a campaign.

733
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:11,080
 There was this amazing woman called Charlotte Epstein,

734
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:12,840
 who was a court stenographer, actually,

735
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:17,040
 and she'd formed the Women's Swimming Association in 1917.

736
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:21,400
 And she campaigned to have the stocking requirement removed.

737
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:23,160
 And eventually she did this stunt,

738
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:25,960
 where she invited some of the best women in the country,

739
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:27,400
 female swimmers in the country,

740
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:29,440
 to come to a beach in California

741
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:32,960
 and strip down to ordinary swimsuits without stockings.

742
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:34,440
 And they were all arrested.

743
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:37,520
 And she invited the tabloids to see them all be arrested.

744
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:40,760
 And this kind of created this atmosphere of how ridiculous is this?

745
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:42,960
 Women are just being arrested for wearing swimming costumes.

746
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:45,480
 Come on, guys, sort your shit out.

747
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:46,880
 And so they relaxed the rules.

748
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:50,520
 But you did have to very quickly put on a robe as soon as you emerged.

749
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:53,560
 Yeah, the rules were pretty strict, weren't they, back in the day?

750
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:57,160
 Like, in 1921, in New York,

751
00:29:57,160 --> 00:30:01,480
 everyone had to wear a two-piece swimming suit, everyone.

752
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:04,520
 And there was a specific law that made it illegal

753
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:07,200
 for any bold men to stare at women.

754
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:09,720
 Yeah, I saw that. What does that mean?

755
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:11,160
 I couldn't find...

756
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:14,480
 I think that was one person on the beach,

757
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:16,360
 like the person who was monitoring that beach,

758
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:19,920
 who thought that bold men were sort of equated with perverts.

759
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:22,800
 And he said, "I'm going to stop bold men from staring at women."

760
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:24,200
 It's so strange.

761
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:27,480
 Maybe there was a specific bold man that they were worried about,

762
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:30,040
 like, Stairy Steve, and they sort of said,

763
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:32,600
 "Well, we can't say Stairy Steve is found from the beach,

764
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:34,320
 "but we will say this."

765
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:37,240
 Yeah, well, weren't hats very popular back then?

766
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:39,200
 So maybe bold means a hatless,

767
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:43,640
 because maybe they were taking their hat down to hide a protrusion below.

768
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:47,840
 Is that how, you know, how they always say in the olden days,

769
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:50,240
 whenever you met a lady, you had to lift your hat?

770
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:53,360
 It wasn't to hide your protrusion, Dan.

771
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:57,200
 The taller the hat, the bigger the brag.

772
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:00,320
 You remember Mr. Darcy always had a very tall top hat.

773
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:02,920
 But that's how you catch them, is that you just say,

774
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:04,120
 "Can you show me your hands, please?"

775
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:06,640
 And if the hat stays where it is on their lap,

776
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:09,760
 then you know that there's a protrusion situation.

777
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:14,440
 In the Olympics, the first time that women swam in the Olympics,

778
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:16,280
 I think, was in 1912.

779
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:19,960
 And the British team had to wear a bra and knickers

780
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:22,200
 while they swam, as well as their swimsuit.

781
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:26,360
 And that's because they had this amazingly awesome silk swimsuit

782
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:28,480
 that would help them to swim really fast.

783
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:31,480
 But it was completely see-through when it got wet.

784
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:33,120
 And so, I mean, it was amazing.

785
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:35,320
 It was so thin, the silk,

786
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:37,760
 that you could take the whole thing and pass it through a wedding ring.

787
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:40,040
 That's how thin the material was.

788
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:42,080
 But it did have that one problem that it was see-through,

789
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:43,800
 so you had to wear underwear as well.

790
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:47,360
 And was it a Superman situation where it's on top of the outfit?

791
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:50,480
 I've seen the pictures and they were on the inside,

792
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:52,640
 but definitely they should have gone the outside, shouldn't they?

793
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:53,640
 Yeah.

794
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:56,880
 I find it really bizarre that women weren't encouraged to swim

795
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:58,280
 until about the 19th century.

796
00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:03,280
 So this only really became a situation then or late on then,

797
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:06,800
 because before that, if you were a woman, you just didn't swim.

798
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:09,440
 I thought there's very little evidence of women swimming

799
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:11,280
 before the 17th century.

800
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:12,600
 There is some.

801
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:16,360
 Yeah, I found the description of a standard ladies' bathing costume

802
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:20,400
 in 1687 by someone called Celia Fiennes,

803
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:24,080
 who said it was made of fine yellow canvas,

804
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:26,560
 which made it that when you went in the water,

805
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:27,920
 it filled up with water,

806
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:30,440
 so no one could see the shape of your body.

807
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:31,440
 Crafty.

808
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:33,320
 I'm clever, like a Mr. Blobby costume.

809
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:36,600
 A Mr. Blobby, yeah, because you can never tell how sexy

810
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:39,080
 the person playing Mr. Blobby is, can't you?

811
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:42,200
 They don't need to be sexy on the inside

812
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:45,320
 if they're wearing a Mr. Blobby costume, I'm theirs.

813
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:48,760
 And in the 18th century in the UK, they made laws.

814
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:51,880
 Every town could make its own laws about what you would wear

815
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:52,720
 when you were swimming.

816
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:55,640
 So in the city of Bath,

817
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:59,440
 they made it illegal for men to swim without a waistcoat.

818
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:00,440
 No.

819
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:07,240
 Is that with, would men have to have the sort of the top as well,

820
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:09,360
 or is this bare chest with a waistcoat on?

821
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:11,600
 I think the waistcoat just referred to anything

822
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:13,080
 that would cover your chest, really.

823
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:16,520
 It wasn't like a proper top hat and tails kind of thing.

824
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:17,520
 Yeah.

825
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:21,160
 Did you guys come across Donald Clark in your research?

826
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:22,160
 Yeah.

827
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:25,480
 He was an early, he was very much fighting the tide of history.

828
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:27,640
 He was an opponent to mixed swimming.

829
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:30,040
 He was a counsellor in Tonbridge,

830
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:35,400
 and he said that by making girls look like wet Scotch terriers,

831
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:38,920
 mixed bathing stops more marriages than any other cause

832
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:40,280
 and much unrest in the country

833
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:42,520
 due to the barbarous licence of women's dress.

834
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:44,760
 So he was basically saying women look like such mingers

835
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:47,080
 when they've been in the water that no one will want to marry them.

836
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:50,920
 And he was then, so this is in a sort of furious letter

837
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:52,200
 to the papers or something,

838
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:54,360
 he was then given a job by the Daily Mail

839
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:56,760
 to go around beaches looking for outrageous things

840
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:57,880
 to be angry about.

841
00:33:57,880 --> 00:34:00,360
 Some things haven't changed.

842
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:02,200
 That's amazing.

843
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:03,960
 Wow.

844
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:05,080
 That's so good,

845
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:07,240
 because I think the Daily Mail does employ a lot of people

846
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:08,680
 like that still today, doesn't it?

847
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:10,520
 Literally just find something to get angry about.

848
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:12,120
 We need to fill our vages.

849
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:12,600
 Anything.

850
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:18,040
 I was reading about a swimming hero called Gertrude Eddell,

851
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:21,640
 so she was the first woman to swim the English Channel in 1925.

852
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:26,440
 And she was trained by this guy called Jabez Wolff,

853
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:27,800
 who was a bizarre character himself.

854
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:29,880
 I don't know why she chose him to train her,

855
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:33,880
 because he'd tried and failed to swim the Channel 22 times previously.

856
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:38,360
 And despite, apparently, he employed a bagpiper for encouragement,

857
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:39,160
 and that didn't help.

858
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:42,200
 But anyway, she tried and...

859
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:43,480
 If the bagpipers are behind you,

860
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:45,000
 then that will encourage you to swim forward.

861
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:49,080
 You're trying to get as far away from Scotland as you can.

862
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:53,720
 So her first attempt, he, Jabez,

863
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:55,960
 her trainer pulled her out of the water halfway through,

864
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:58,040
 saying that it looked like she was drowning.

865
00:34:58,040 --> 00:34:59,720
 And she said she wasn't drowning at all.

866
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:02,120
 She'd just been having a rest face down in the water.

867
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:04,040
 Eventually she did it.

868
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:06,200
 She was the sixth person ever to swim the Channel,

869
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:08,840
 and she was the fastest ever of men and women.

870
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:10,440
 She did it in 14 and a half hours.

871
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:13,240
 So she beat the previous person by two hours.

872
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:15,160
 Did front crawl all the way.

873
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:18,440
 And the first thing, she did it from France to England.

874
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:21,080
 And the first person to meet her on the beach in Kent

875
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:22,920
 when she arrived was an immigration officer

876
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:24,440
 who demanded to see her passport.

877
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:25,080
 Amazing.

878
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:27,560
 He was actually working for the Daily Mail, wasn't he, at the time?

879
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:31,720
 Do you know what she was fed on the way?

880
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:33,080
 I find this so weird.

881
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:35,880
 What she got fed, chicken legs.

882
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:36,440
 I think...

883
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:38,280
 Because if they touched you in the water,

884
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:39,720
 then that sort of, you're out.

885
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:41,560
 Because you've been kind of supported by him.

886
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:43,640
 But her support boat was apparently full of chicken legs,

887
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:46,040
 which, okay, throws someone a chicken leg in the water.

888
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:49,720
 Oranges and chicken soup to sustain her as she went.

889
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:53,560
 And I have no idea how she was fed the soup.

890
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:55,560
 Right. What must happen, right, is,

891
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:57,560
 I don't want to take anything away from her swim,

892
00:35:57,560 --> 00:36:00,600
 but they give her a straw to suck the soup.

893
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:02,920
 And actually she's biting onto the straw

894
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:04,280
 while it's attached to the boat,

895
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:05,800
 and she's used it to pull her along.

896
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:09,000
 So she's water skiing there basically.

897
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,040
 Basically doing that.

898
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:13,160
 This is a great and niche conspiracy theory

899
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:15,720
 that needs to see more at.

900
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:19,240
 One person who tried to swim the channel before Gertrude

901
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:21,800
 was an Australian called Annette Kellerman,

902
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:24,520
 who was probably the most famous swimmer in the world.

903
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:29,080
 She was the first woman to publicly wear a one-piece swimming costume.

904
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:30,440
 She was arrested on the beach.

905
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:31,880
 She was one of these people who was arrested

906
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:36,360
 for public indecency for wearing like a two-sexier swimming costume.

907
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:38,600
 But it wasn't really very effective,

908
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:41,560
 and she ended up releasing her own line of bathing costumes

909
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:44,360
 and became massively rich because people wanted to look like her

910
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:45,800
 because she was so famous.

911
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:48,840
 She was paid by the Melbourne exhibition hall to swim in,

912
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:49,800
 and it's aquarium.

913
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:52,600
 So people would come and watch her swim.

914
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:54,600
 It was like you were saying about the Bordeville earlier,

915
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:57,080
 and it was like you would just go to watch her swim.

916
00:36:57,080 --> 00:37:00,120
 She was like a swimming costume hero, wasn't she?

917
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:03,880
 She was the person who brought us the swimming costume, Annette Kellerman.

918
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:05,160
 We've been pitching about the Daily Mail,

919
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:09,000
 so for some balance, here's some perspective on the Daily Mirror.

920
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,160
 She came between Australia and America.

921
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:13,320
 She came to the UK to do some swimming,

922
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:16,920
 and she broke a record for swimming from Dober to Margate,

923
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:19,320
 and she caused this huge stir, and it was all great.

924
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:22,760
 And the Daily Mirror paid her to swim along that coast

925
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:24,760
 every single day for two months.

926
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:27,960
 And they said to her, she was like, every day for two months?

927
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:30,280
 Oh, God. I mean, that sounds like hell.

928
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:31,960
 And they said it's a huge thing for women.

929
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:34,600
 It's going to go down as a great, successful, women kind.

930
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:36,120
 And what they actually meant was,

931
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:38,680
 there's a lady from Australia in a swimsuit,

932
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:39,960
 which we've never seen before here,

933
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:42,040
 and they obviously invited lots of crowds every day

934
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:44,360
 to come and watch her in her swimsuit

935
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:46,200
 and made loads of money selling their papers.

936
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:48,840
 And it was sort of the first page three type things

937
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:50,760
 were these pictures of Annette Kellerman

938
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:52,520
 and people like her in swimsuits.

939
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:54,600
 I've read about her show.

940
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:56,200
 She was called The Diving Venus,

941
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:59,720
 and the show ran on Broadway for four years.

942
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:05,000
 And then she went to Hollywood and she starred

943
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,760
 in a film called Daughter of the Gods.

944
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:09,320
 She did loads of films, but this was in 1916.

945
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:12,520
 And the film used 20,000 extras.

946
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:13,720
 It cost a million dollars to make,

947
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:15,720
 which was pretty unusual at the time.

948
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:19,000
 And there were scenes of her swimming nude in it,

949
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,080
 I think from quite a distance,

950
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:23,480
 but this led to the formal banning of,

951
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:25,560
 as they were called, nude scenes in films.

952
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:29,080
 And so, yeah, it's thanks to her.

953
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:31,640
 Yeah, she did all her own stunts in that movie,

954
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:33,960
 including a 20-meter dive into the ocean

955
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:36,120
 with her hands and feet tied together

956
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:39,240
 and also being thrown into a pool with six crocodiles.

957
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:43,000
 Wow, it really, it sounds like a promoter Bill Sargent.

958
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:46,600
 He really would have made a lot of money out of that woman.

959
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:49,160
 When she was on Broadway making all her money,

960
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:53,080
 she made $1,250 a week on Broadway.

961
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:55,320
 And when she was doing it, there was a Harvard professor

962
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:57,160
 who said she was a perfect woman

963
00:38:57,160 --> 00:39:00,040
 after comparing her measurements to the Venus de Milo.

964
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:02,440
 Now, the Venus de Milo doesn't have any arms.

965
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:03,320
 No.

966
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:07,560
 Useful in swimming, particularly.

967
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:13,240
 OK, it's time for our final fact of the show,

968
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:15,080
 and that is Andy.

969
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:17,240
 My fact is that the film of Dr. Dolittle

970
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:20,040
 was delayed for days after the giraffe being used

971
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:22,120
 accidentally stepped on its own penis.

972
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:25,240
 So...

973
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:27,800
 How long is a giraffe's penis?

974
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:28,680
 Is it, like, a fifth leg?

975
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:31,320
 Well, is it that before or after you've trodden on it?

976
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:32,440
 That's the question.

977
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:33,960
 They have really long legs.

978
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:37,640
 I just can't work out the mechanics of this, Andy, at all.

979
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:38,200
 It doesn't...

980
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:41,480
 Well, they, I mean, they're like folding deck chairs.

981
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:43,000
 You know, it's very easy to get something

982
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,200
 caught in a folding deck chair,

983
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:45,800
 and I think that's the same principle.

984
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:48,520
 You need to stop going on those nudist holidays, Andy.

985
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:50,680
 I can't take many more of those injuries.

986
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:51,400
 I'll tell you that much.

987
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:54,680
 So, to be completely clear,

988
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:57,720
 this is the 1967 "Dr. Dolittle" with Rex Harrison,

989
00:39:57,720 --> 00:39:59,640
 not the 2021 with Robert Downey Jr.,

990
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:01,240
 where pretty much all the animals are CGI,

991
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:03,160
 and nobody stepped on anybody's penises.

992
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:05,880
 And this comes from a great book called

993
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:08,200
 "Scenes from a Revolution, the Birth of the New Hollywood,"

994
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:11,640
 which is kind of an in-depth look at five films in particular.

995
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:15,560
 It's by Mark Harris, and one of those films is "Dr. Dolittle,"

996
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:18,360
 and there was a guy working on it called Herbert Ross,

997
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:20,120
 who was the choreographer,

998
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:21,480
 and he wrote to a colleague saying,

999
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:25,320
 "We're postponed for three days, the giraffe stepped on his cock."

1000
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:29,880
 And so, it stepped on his cock, though?

1001
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:31,160
 Are we misreading that?

1002
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:33,720
 Yeah, stepped on Rex Harrison.

1003
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:37,720
 Yeah, so that's that.

1004
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:40,120
 It was pretty chaotic, wasn't it, that film?

1005
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:40,840
 Sounds amazing.

1006
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:44,200
 Apparently, it was revealed after it was one giraffe died,

1007
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:46,440
 and I don't think we know how, still,

1008
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:48,520
 but one of the people who worked on it said one giraffe died.

1009
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:51,320
 But, I mean, the general management of animals

1010
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:52,280
 sounds like hell.

1011
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:53,880
 It had lots of different filming locations,

1012
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:57,480
 so it was partly filmed in LA and then in the Caribbean and in the UK.

1013
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:59,160
 And because of quarantine laws,

1014
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:01,880
 they had to hire separate sets of identical animals

1015
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:04,440
 for each place to play the same characters.

1016
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:07,400
 And then also, the animals grow so fast

1017
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:09,720
 that they had to keep finding replacements, like doppelgangers.

1018
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:13,080
 So, I think there was a pig called "Gubgub" in the film,

1019
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:16,360
 which had 40 different piglets play at various times.

1020
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:19,080
 I mean, it does seem questionable, doesn't it?

1021
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:21,880
 A lot of the sort of stuff they did to the animals,

1022
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:24,120
 there was a squirrel that they had to sedate

1023
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:25,720
 during a scene that they needed him for.

1024
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:28,840
 By the sedation method they used was a fountain pen

1025
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:32,200
 where they dripped a gin through it to just get it drunk.

1026
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:33,720
 But it ended up losing consciousness,

1027
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:36,040
 because it was so drunk that they couldn't properly get the scene done.

1028
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:37,960
 That doesn't seem very ethical in terms of...

1029
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:39,080
 I think that's absolutely fine.

1030
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:41,240
 Elizabeth Taylor used to request that kind of thing

1031
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:42,760
 before she'd go over it at the camera.

1032
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:47,560
 There's a great story where in one scene

1033
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:49,880
 that Rex Harrison was doing, he kept...

1034
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:52,120
 This is the story that he kept stopping the scene

1035
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:53,640
 and the director's going, "What are you doing?"

1036
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:55,800
 And he goes, "Well, you keep calling cut."

1037
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:58,760
 He's going, "I'm not calling cut, you're definitely calling cut."

1038
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:01,480
 And they worked out that it was the parrot that was in the scene

1039
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:03,160
 that's going to mimic the word "cut."

1040
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:04,040
 No way.

1041
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:07,000
 Yeah, and Rex was getting confused.

1042
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,960
 So, they built a set for the house of Dr. Doolittle.

1043
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:12,600
 Whose whole stake is that he can talk to the animals.

1044
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:13,800
 So, he lives with a load of animals.

1045
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:18,440
 But the whole house, the set had to be built on a slant

1046
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:20,840
 because obviously the animals are pooing everywhere

1047
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:22,040
 and peeing everywhere.

1048
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:24,280
 So, they had lots of people in the crew

1049
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:27,720
 just standing around with brooms waiting for when that happened.

1050
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:30,200
 All the furniture had to be either plastic or painted

1051
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:33,000
 so that it could be hosed down at the end of each day

1052
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,840
 filming in this set house.

1053
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:36,360
 They had to have double the sets

1054
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:38,600
 because frequently animals would just kick a hole

1055
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:40,440
 in the walls or the furniture.

1056
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:43,640
 The trainers got hepatitis from being bitten.

1057
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:47,800
 I read one amazing sentence in the link you sent, Andy,

1058
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:50,760
 which is, "Unfathomably, the ducks in the pond

1059
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:53,880
 "appeared to forget how to swim and started to sink."

1060
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:57,480
 You know you're having a bad time.

1061
00:42:57,480 --> 00:42:59,400
 You think you'd be able to rely on the ducks

1062
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:00,600
 to be able to swim.

1063
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:01,560
 So funny.

1064
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:03,720
 But apparently what had happened was

1065
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:05,160
 it was the wrong time of year,

1066
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:08,280
 so they'd lost all their waterproof sheen on their feathers.

1067
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:09,240
 And at that time of year,

1068
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:11,160
 ducks don't normally swim or something.

1069
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:12,760
 And so they all just started sinking.

1070
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:13,880
 Yeah, I found that amazing.

1071
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:15,240
 I didn't know that.

1072
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:16,360
 Didn't know that ever happened.

1073
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:17,400
 Incredible.

1074
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:18,920
 Has anyone seen the movie?

1075
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:20,120
 Years ago as a kid, yeah.

1076
00:43:20,120 --> 00:43:21,080
 Really? Was that any good?

1077
00:43:21,080 --> 00:43:23,560
 Yeah, I mean as a kid it was one of those

1078
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:24,680
 Sunday afternoon movies.

1079
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:26,280
 And I do remember loving it,

1080
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:28,040
 but I've read a lot of things

1081
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:29,800
 that suggest that I'm completely wrong about that.

1082
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:31,880
 It has a very low rating.

1083
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:34,120
 It got the best-pitched Oscar nomination,

1084
00:43:34,120 --> 00:43:37,160
 but it's the lowest-rated score on Rotten Tomatoes

1085
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:38,760
 ever to get a nomination.

1086
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:41,400
 Ooh, what's it rocking on Rotten?

1087
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:42,200
 32%.

1088
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:45,800
 Rex Harrison, who was the star of it,

1089
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:47,720
 was so horrible to everyone

1090
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:49,720
 that he was nicknamed Tyrannosaurus Rex,

1091
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:51,400
 which is very clever when you think

1092
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:53,480
 because it's a film about animals that are talking.

1093
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:54,200
 Yes.

1094
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:56,680
 He had a good reputation for behaving like that

1095
00:43:56,680 --> 00:43:58,440
 quite frequently, didn't he, Rex Harrison?

1096
00:43:58,440 --> 00:43:59,880
 He was grumpy bastard.

1097
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:00,920
 Or a character,

1098
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:02,760
 depending on which way you want to frame it.

1099
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:04,280
 But I should say,

1100
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:05,800
 so I'm a huge My Fair Lady fan

1101
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:07,960
 and a big Rex Harrison fan in that.

1102
00:44:07,960 --> 00:44:09,880
 And there's a guy called Will Harrison,

1103
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:12,920
 who's his grandson, who listens to the podcast.

1104
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:15,720
 So we have inside Rex Harrison info,

1105
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:16,600
 apparently on,

1106
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:18,840
 if you look at the film poster of Cleopatra,

1107
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:20,680
 who was supposed to just have Richard Burton

1108
00:44:20,680 --> 00:44:22,920
 and Elizabeth Taylor on it as Anthony and Cleopatra.

1109
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:23,480
 OK.

1110
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:25,720
 But Rex was like, I'm the big star here, guys.

1111
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:26,520
 What the hell are you doing?

1112
00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:27,480
 Get me on the poster.

1113
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:29,240
 And so you see just behind them,

1114
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:31,800
 Juliet Caesar, Rex Harrison staring

1115
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:33,960
 really creepily down at this loving couple.

1116
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:35,960
 And he was always doing stuff like that.

1117
00:44:35,960 --> 00:44:37,800
 There's one particularly famous anecdote

1118
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:40,280
 which is that he'd performed in the theater

1119
00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:43,400
 and there was an autograph hunter waiting outside.

1120
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:45,320
 She had her book ready for him to sign.

1121
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:47,160
 He came out, she asked for the autograph

1122
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:49,240
 and he said, "Sod off."

1123
00:44:49,240 --> 00:44:50,360
 And what she did was,

1124
00:44:50,360 --> 00:44:51,480
 she rolled up the program,

1125
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:54,440
 she wanted him to sign and she hit him with it.

1126
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:56,920
 And the co-star of the play, Stanley Holloway,

1127
00:44:56,920 --> 00:45:00,840
 later said that it was a rare but welcome case

1128
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:02,360
 of the fan hitting the shit.

1129
00:45:02,360 --> 00:45:06,200
 That's how they viewed him.

1130
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:08,840
 You know Christopher Plummer, the actor?

1131
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:09,240
 Yes.

1132
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:11,240
 He has a sound of music and stuff, I guess.

1133
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:14,840
 He was paid $300,000 not to be in "Doctor Do Little."

1134
00:45:14,840 --> 00:45:15,720
 Really?

1135
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:20,280
 Which is such an epic fail by the accountants, I think.

1136
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:22,920
 So basically, Harrison temporarily quit the project.

1137
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:25,080
 He decided he wasn't completely up for it.

1138
00:45:25,080 --> 00:45:26,440
 And then so they said,

1139
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:28,360
 "Well, who do we get? We need some Hollywood giant."

1140
00:45:28,360 --> 00:45:29,480
 So they got Christopher Plummer,

1141
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:32,440
 signed him up for $300,000.

1142
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:33,640
 And then Harrison said,

1143
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:35,240
 "Oh, fine, I will do the film then."

1144
00:45:35,240 --> 00:45:36,840
 So Plummer never filmed a scene,

1145
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:38,120
 never said a line of the dialogue,

1146
00:45:38,120 --> 00:45:40,280
 but still got paid his full fee for it.

1147
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:41,400
 It's the dream job.

1148
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:42,520
 It's the dream job.

1149
00:45:42,520 --> 00:45:45,720
 It was originally written by a woman called Helen Winston.

1150
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:47,880
 And they rewrote it.

1151
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:49,480
 They just completely rewrote the thing.

1152
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:52,520
 Apart from, they used loads of her stuff,

1153
00:45:52,520 --> 00:45:54,440
 but then didn't tell her she was going to use it.

1154
00:45:54,440 --> 00:45:56,200
 And so she sued them and she got

1155
00:45:56,200 --> 00:45:58,920
 £3.2 million out of them for that.

1156
00:45:58,920 --> 00:45:59,320
 Whoa!

1157
00:45:59,320 --> 00:46:03,480
 And it lost £9 million in the box office.

1158
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:07,240
 So a third of that was just due to stealing this woman's work.

1159
00:46:07,240 --> 00:46:09,480
 So actually, the two people in it

1160
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:11,480
 who had their work stolen from them,

1161
00:46:11,480 --> 00:46:13,800
 Christopher Plummer and this lady,

1162
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:15,160
 sounds like they were the real winners here.

1163
00:46:15,160 --> 00:46:19,960
 So Dr. Dolittle is incredibly loosely based

1164
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:22,280
 on a series of stories written by Hugh Lofting

1165
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:26,120
 in the 1920s and during the First World War.

1166
00:46:26,120 --> 00:46:27,480
 And they bear no resemblance.

1167
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:28,120
 I don't think the plots,

1168
00:46:28,120 --> 00:46:30,120
 but any resemblance to the stories he originally wrote,

1169
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:32,680
 but they are about a doctor who talks to animals.

1170
00:46:32,680 --> 00:46:34,760
 And it's quite a sweet story.

1171
00:46:34,760 --> 00:46:36,360
 So I hadn't realised he wrote them

1172
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:38,920
 while he was fighting in the trenches in World War I,

1173
00:46:38,920 --> 00:46:41,400
 and he was writing letters back to his children.

1174
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:43,080
 And he understandably thought,

1175
00:46:43,080 --> 00:46:44,280
 "I'm not sure I want to tell the kids

1176
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:46,680
 about my trenches-based experience."

1177
00:46:46,680 --> 00:46:49,160
 And so instead, he wrote these brilliant stories

1178
00:46:49,160 --> 00:46:50,440
 about a guy who talks to animals.

1179
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:53,640
 He was a real crusader for animal rights in lots of ways.

1180
00:46:53,640 --> 00:46:55,400
 And he once beat up three men,

1181
00:46:55,400 --> 00:46:56,600
 including one who had a knife,

1182
00:46:56,600 --> 00:46:58,600
 because they were trying to tame some wild horses.

1183
00:46:58,600 --> 00:47:00,680
 And they were, I think,

1184
00:47:00,680 --> 00:47:02,680
 not being especially pleasant to the horses.

1185
00:47:02,680 --> 00:47:03,720
 So, yeah.

1186
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:07,480
 Yeah, he was very strong on sympathising with animals.

1187
00:47:07,480 --> 00:47:09,800
 He was shocked by how horses were treated.

1188
00:47:09,800 --> 00:47:12,760
 They did have a very bad time in the First World War.

1189
00:47:12,760 --> 00:47:15,560
 Yeah, it was the way that he saw horses being treated.

1190
00:47:15,560 --> 00:47:18,280
 And they needed to be looked after by vets.

1191
00:47:18,280 --> 00:47:18,920
 But he was like,

1192
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:21,400
 "Well, they can't really tell us what's wrong with them

1193
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:22,440
 because they're horses."

1194
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:24,120
 And that was kind of what gave him the idea

1195
00:47:24,120 --> 00:47:25,320
 of writing "Doctor Do Little."

1196
00:47:25,320 --> 00:47:28,920
 But we should say that if you have read "Doctor Do Little"

1197
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:31,000
 in the last 20 or 30 years,

1198
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:34,360
 you're probably reading a massively sanitised version of it,

1199
00:47:34,360 --> 00:47:37,720
 because the original is extremely racist.

1200
00:47:37,720 --> 00:47:42,360
 So, in 1968, there was a librarian called Isabelle Sewell,

1201
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:45,560
 who wrote an essay about a few different books,

1202
00:47:45,560 --> 00:47:47,800
 but specifically about "Doctor Do Little,"

1203
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:51,080
 who described you lofting as a white, racist, and chauvinist,

1204
00:47:51,080 --> 00:47:55,080
 guilty of almost every prejudice known to modern white, western man.

1205
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:56,840
 And that was in the '60s.

1206
00:47:56,840 --> 00:47:58,600
 So, yeah, exactly.

1207
00:47:58,600 --> 00:48:00,760
 And so, basically, from then on,

1208
00:48:00,760 --> 00:48:02,520
 he just got pretty much cancelled,

1209
00:48:02,520 --> 00:48:06,040
 and really all his books went out-print for quite a long time

1210
00:48:06,040 --> 00:48:11,080
 until they got rewritten with a lot of the racist bits taken out.

1211
00:48:11,080 --> 00:48:13,480
 Yeah, with no resemblance to the originals, basically.

1212
00:48:13,480 --> 00:48:16,200
 But on the other hand, loved horses.

1213
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:18,920
 Yeah, I mean, anti-war and pro-animal, for sure.

1214
00:48:18,920 --> 00:48:20,520
 Yeah, yeah.

1215
00:48:20,520 --> 00:48:24,600
 So, I've been looking a bit into talking to animals,

1216
00:48:25,240 --> 00:48:28,600
 and people are doing serious work on this right now,

1217
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:29,720
 and it's really cool.

1218
00:48:29,720 --> 00:48:31,640
 So, there is a new device,

1219
00:48:31,640 --> 00:48:35,000
 which is trying to train basically Lassie technology.

1220
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:38,920
 So, the idea is that dogs will have a vest,

1221
00:48:38,920 --> 00:48:40,120
 and if the person needs help,

1222
00:48:40,120 --> 00:48:42,440
 they can pull a tab to communicate a message, okay?

1223
00:48:42,440 --> 00:48:46,680
 So, it might be someone's fallen down a well,

1224
00:48:46,680 --> 00:48:47,880
 but that's probably not going to be it,

1225
00:48:47,880 --> 00:48:50,440
 because it's only one message on the tab that they can pull.

1226
00:48:51,640 --> 00:48:55,400
 So, for example, lots of children with autism

1227
00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:58,120
 find it very helpful and calming to have a dog,

1228
00:48:58,120 --> 00:49:02,120
 and if they are panicking or upset,

1229
00:49:02,120 --> 00:49:03,800
 it might be possible to train the dog

1230
00:49:03,800 --> 00:49:06,440
 to pull the tab on its little vest,

1231
00:49:06,440 --> 00:49:08,600
 because it can spot the size that its owner is upset,

1232
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:11,240
 and then that will read out the dog saying,

1233
00:49:11,240 --> 00:49:12,520
 "Could you please pet me now?"

1234
00:49:12,520 --> 00:49:15,640
 And then therefore, the child will pet the dog,

1235
00:49:15,640 --> 00:49:17,320
 and we'll calm down and that will help.

1236
00:49:17,320 --> 00:49:19,720
 So, they're trying to see if they can train dogs

1237
00:49:19,720 --> 00:49:21,160
 to have several different messages,

1238
00:49:21,160 --> 00:49:22,680
 or if they can train it.

1239
00:49:22,680 --> 00:49:23,880
 So, either could you pet me now,

1240
00:49:23,880 --> 00:49:26,600
 or someone's fallen down a well, or whatever it might be.

1241
00:49:26,600 --> 00:49:29,560
 It's just those two they've coded in on the internet.

1242
00:49:29,560 --> 00:49:34,520
 Wait, so the dog senses that the child is anxious,

1243
00:49:34,520 --> 00:49:36,920
 and so then pulls the tab that says, "Can you pet me?"

1244
00:49:36,920 --> 00:49:39,320
 So, the child signals they're anxious without realizing it,

1245
00:49:39,320 --> 00:49:41,880
 and then the dog does something to make the child calm down.

1246
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:43,000
 Yeah, exactly, yeah, yeah.

1247
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:44,360
 Yeah, well, you might be anxious,

1248
00:49:44,360 --> 00:49:46,520
 because the dog's just told you that someone's fallen down a well.

1249
00:49:48,680 --> 00:49:50,520
 I really wish I hadn't mentioned this well thing.

1250
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:52,440
 Complete red herring.

1251
00:49:52,440 --> 00:49:53,640
 Do you know that...

1252
00:49:53,640 --> 00:49:55,960
 I was going to do this as a fact in a future week,

1253
00:49:55,960 --> 00:49:58,440
 but do you know that the traditional way of preparing melon

1254
00:49:58,440 --> 00:50:00,600
 in France was to put it down a well for four hours?

1255
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:02,120
 Melon?

1256
00:50:02,120 --> 00:50:02,840
 A melon, yeah.

1257
00:50:02,840 --> 00:50:03,960
 Because before...

1258
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:06,360
 What, and it came up perfectly sliced, I'm sure.

1259
00:50:06,360 --> 00:50:08,760
 Who lived down that well?

1260
00:50:08,760 --> 00:50:12,280
 A small child who fell there many years ago.

1261
00:50:12,280 --> 00:50:13,800
 No, they are...

1262
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:17,080
 Basically, you wanted your melon to be nice and cold, right?

1263
00:50:17,080 --> 00:50:19,800
 And they had no refrigeration, but they did have a well,

1264
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:21,080
 which was cold at the bottom.

1265
00:50:21,080 --> 00:50:23,000
 So, they used to traditionally, in France,

1266
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,960
 they would put their melon in the well a few hours before,

1267
00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:28,680
 and then bring it up, and it's nice and cold.

1268
00:50:28,680 --> 00:50:30,680
 So, the dog would, in this case, have a third tab,

1269
00:50:30,680 --> 00:50:32,520
 which says, "Your melon is ready, sir."

1270
00:50:32,520 --> 00:50:38,360
 That was in an article written by B Wilson that I read the other day,

1271
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:39,640
 which is pretty amazing.

1272
00:50:39,640 --> 00:50:43,480
 Artificial intelligence might help us to talk to animals,

1273
00:50:43,480 --> 00:50:44,920
 or to understand what they're thinking.

1274
00:50:45,720 --> 00:50:48,760
 There is a scientist called Dr. Krista McLennan,

1275
00:50:48,760 --> 00:50:53,080
 who is working on a way of using AI to tell you what sheep are thinking.

1276
00:50:53,080 --> 00:50:57,800
 And apparently, it's really hard for farmers to tell what a sheep is thinking,

1277
00:50:57,800 --> 00:50:59,160
 just by looking at its face.

1278
00:50:59,160 --> 00:51:02,600
 Because they don't have much expression on their faces.

1279
00:51:02,600 --> 00:51:05,240
 You often see farmers kneeling down,

1280
00:51:05,240 --> 00:51:07,560
 just staring deep into a sheep's eyes, don't you?

1281
00:51:07,560 --> 00:51:09,480
 Going, "Why can't I tell?"

1282
00:51:09,480 --> 00:51:11,480
 I mean, I believe this.

1283
00:51:11,480 --> 00:51:14,360
 So, I was reading this article about this AI algorithm

1284
00:51:14,360 --> 00:51:17,080
 that tells you whether a sheep's happy or not happy.

1285
00:51:17,080 --> 00:51:18,040
 And there's part of it.

1286
00:51:18,040 --> 00:51:23,160
 On NBC, they had a quiz where they would show you pictures of sheep,

1287
00:51:23,160 --> 00:51:25,560
 and you had to guess whether they were happy or sad.

1288
00:51:25,560 --> 00:51:30,280
 I only got one out of four, and that was a lucky guess,

1289
00:51:30,280 --> 00:51:32,520
 because I just had three sad sheep in a row,

1290
00:51:32,520 --> 00:51:34,360
 and I thought the fourth one must be a happy.

1291
00:51:34,360 --> 00:51:35,240
 That's games for a show.

1292
00:51:35,240 --> 00:51:36,360
 I did that same quiz.

1293
00:51:36,360 --> 00:51:38,280
 I got three.

1294
00:51:38,280 --> 00:51:40,760
 So, I'm a sheep whisperer, basically.

1295
00:51:42,840 --> 00:51:44,680
 I didn't. It's quite specific, isn't it, though?

1296
00:51:44,680 --> 00:51:45,960
 It is tricky.

1297
00:51:45,960 --> 00:51:50,040
 So, the signs of pain or emotional suffering in a sheep are

1298
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:51,640
 narrow eyes, tight cheeks.

1299
00:51:51,640 --> 00:51:54,200
 Oh, hold on. I don't know if I really want to do the test.

1300
00:51:54,200 --> 00:51:54,760
 Yeah.

1301
00:51:54,760 --> 00:51:55,320
 Okay.

1302
00:51:55,320 --> 00:51:56,840
 Don't tell us your facts.

1303
00:51:56,840 --> 00:51:59,080
 Anna, tell me the symptoms before you do the test,

1304
00:51:59,080 --> 00:52:00,280
 is what the test is based on.

1305
00:52:00,280 --> 00:52:00,920
 That's the thing.

1306
00:52:00,920 --> 00:52:05,000
 They say if it has a nostril shape like a V rather than a U,

1307
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:06,680
 then it's either happy or sad.

1308
00:52:06,680 --> 00:52:08,280
 Even though it told me that, I couldn't do it.

1309
00:52:08,280 --> 00:52:10,600
 Although, I think handy, because there were only four,

1310
00:52:10,600 --> 00:52:14,200
 and it was a 50/50 choice each time, then one out of four

1311
00:52:14,200 --> 00:52:16,760
 and three out of four is within the standard deviation

1312
00:52:16,760 --> 00:52:18,280
 of what you would expect.

1313
00:52:18,280 --> 00:52:20,280
 Okay. All I'm hearing is that I won.

1314
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:25,320
 I'm going to be the sheep farmer.

1315
00:52:25,320 --> 00:52:34,040
 Okay. That's it. That is all of our facts.

1316
00:52:34,040 --> 00:52:35,560
