00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580
 (upbeat music)

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:17.000
 - Hello and welcome to another episode

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.680
 of No Such Thing as a Fish,

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:20.240
 a weekly podcast coming to you

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:23.320
 from four undisclosed locations in the UK.

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:24.480
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.440
 I am sitting here with James Harkin, Anna Tijinski

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:28.720
 and Andrew Hunter Murray.

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:31.240
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:34.280
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:37.120
 and in no particular order, here we go.

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:39.040
 Starting with you, James.

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:42.520
 - Okay, my fact this week is that in 1948,

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:47.000
 a drive-through fly-through cinema opened in New Jersey

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.840
 where you could watch movies from the seat of your car

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:52.600
 or the seat of your small aircraft.

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:54.200
 - That's great.

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:56.000
 - Okay, so a couple of things to say

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.240
 before we get into this.

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:59.840
 Number one is that most of the following material

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:01.000
 that you're about to hear from me

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.440
 comes from an amazing book

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:05.760
 called The History of Driving Theatres by Kerry Seagrave.

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.440
 And secondly, this fact would have made a lot more sense

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:10.360
 if it had been in its original setting,

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:11.960
 which was in a drive-in show

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:13.920
 that we were supposed to do this week.

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.000
 - Yes, yeah, this episode was meant to be

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.440
 in one very disclosed location

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:22.000
 and unfortunately got canceled.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.800
 - Sorry about that, everyone.

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:25.440
 - Yeah, much apologies. - Not our fault.

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:27.880
 - Not our fault, but you're going to get the facts anyway.

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:28.840
 - I think we can pretend.

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:29.960
 Guys, we can pretend.

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:31.640
 We can just all pretend we're in a car.

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:32.920
 The people at home won't know.

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:35.280
 - Andy, we weren't supposed to be in a car

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.560
 when we were doing the show.

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:38.240
 It was the audience that were in a car.

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:39.880
 We were supposed to be on the stage.

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:42.240
 - I was going to bring my car to the stage

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.960
 and then just sit in there.

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:47.520
 So this fly-through,

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.360
 did you have planes and cars next to each other?

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:52.640
 - The planes were behind the cars.

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:53.480
 - That makes sense,

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:55.320
 because if the planes were in front of the cars,

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.000
 then it's a raw deal if you're sitting in your car, isn't it?

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.400
 Just looking at the arse of a plane.

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:01.600
 - If it's a 747 or something like that,

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:03.080
 you don't want to climb in front of you.

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:06.400
 But this was organized by a guy called Edward Brown Jr.,

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:08.360
 who was a former Navy pilot,

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:12.120
 and his drive-in had capacity for 500 cars

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.360
 and then 25 aeroplanes on the last couple of rows.

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:16.880
 And what would happen is you would fly

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:20.760
 into a nearby airfield and then you would taxi into the,

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.320
 not get a taxi, you would drive the plane on its wheels

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:25.960
 into the last row of the theater,

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:28.560
 and then afterwards a jeep would tow you back

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.640
 to the airfield and you'd be able to fly off again.

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:33.920
 And the charge for the aeroplanes was 25 cents.

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.040
 - Wow. - That's extraordinary.

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:38.040
 I guess this was a bit more in the time

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:41.500
 when your average Joe sometimes had a plane.

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:46.680
 People sort of did a bit more in the '40s, didn't they?

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.240
 They did like a small piece together aeroplanes.

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:50.640
 I think it was much, much more common.

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:51.480
 Like people used to,

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.160
 you used to have hobbyists who would do sort of trick flights

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:57.760
 in and out of sheds and stuff, but still very weird.

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:00.200
 Although I read that it sort of caught on,

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.440
 so it must have had a few people going

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:05.160
 because a few more popped up in the subsequent years, right,

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:06.840
 in like Alabama and Texas.

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.160
 - Yeah, some of them opened by the same guy.

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:12.160
 So I don't know if that's a huge mark of success.

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:15.680
 - You don't open up a second drive-through fly-through

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:17.240
 unless your first one was successful.

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:18.480
 - Yeah, absolutely, yeah.

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:19.320
 - That's true.

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:22.040
 But he really, it was quite exciting what he did

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:25.280
 because he bought this land and he turned the whole,

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:28.040
 so he set up the airport, he set up the drive-through.

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:32.160
 He bulldozed everything in the way using a World War I tank

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:35.800
 and it also had a sort of gulf range next to it

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:37.960
 and an amusement park and playground.

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:38.800
 - There was a great article

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:41.000
 by someone called Mary Morley Cohen on this.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.360
 And I'm just gonna list the extra things

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:44.680
 that one particular drive-in had, okay?

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:48.040
 It had a playground, pony rides, a dance floor,

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:50.440
 shuffleboard and horseshoe pitching tournaments,

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:53.560
 cartoon carnivals, midnight spook shows,

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:56.000
 baby parades and beautiful child contests,

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.800
 daredevil car rides, circus acts,

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:00.840
 high tower dives, anniversary and birthday celebrations,

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:02.880
 fireworks, a picnic and play area,

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:05.560
 potato sack races and television.

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:10.000
 - That's just extra TV in case you're bored of the film,

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:10.840
 I guess.

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:12.120
 - That's amazing.

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:15.680
 There was one in Memphis where you could get your laundry done

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:17.240
 when you went to the drive-in.

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:19.960
 So you turn up with your laundry, hand it in

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:21.200
 and then they clean it for you.

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:22.760
 And as you left, you'd pick it up.

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:24.040
 - That's so good.

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:26.760
 - It's almost like the films just weren't the main attraction.

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:28.960
 And I think someone did an experiment

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:30.160
 'cause they thought actually,

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:32.480
 are people even coming to see the films?

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:35.200
 And so they didn't advertise what film was showing

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:36.680
 and the same number of people showed up.

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:38.160
 And then they started interviewing people

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:39.160
 as they were driving in and said,

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:40.600
 "What film are you coming for?"

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:43.280
 And most people didn't know what film they were going to see.

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:46.400
 They're just kind of coming 'cause it's a thing to do.

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:48.400
 But I think the laundry thing was particularly interesting

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:52.240
 because that was about how one of the appeals of the drive-ins

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:55.160
 was that it appealed to a much broader audience.

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:57.760
 And so, for instance, one of the people they advertised to

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:00.880
 was mothers, housewives, because you could bring your kids.

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:02.840
 So the idea was you didn't have to find a babysitter

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:05.440
 to leave them at home, brought your kids along.

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:08.120
 They also specifically advertised to disabled people

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:09.200
 because you can stay in your car.

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:12.000
 You don't have to get up and maneuver into a seat.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.120
 And they advertised specifically to obese people

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:16.280
 at the start, didn't they?

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:18.360
 I think one of the very first adverts

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:20.240
 from the guy who invented the drive-in

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:22.960
 was a picture of an overweight lady

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:24.560
 trying to squeeze into a cinema seat.

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:25.840
 And then it said something like,

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:28.360
 "Kate doesn't have any problem at the drive-in."

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:29.760
 - So she was called Kate Smith,

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:32.120
 the lady who was in that image.

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:33.800
 And she was a really famous singer

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:36.280
 and she was like the South America's version

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:37.760
 of Dame Vera Lynn.

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:39.720
 So she was really big during the war

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:41.560
 and she sang a load of amazing songs

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:43.920
 and everyone got really patriotic about her.

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:48.160
 And she was also, she sang for the Philadelphia Flyers.

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:50.560
 So before the game, before every game,

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:52.440
 she would sing "God Bless America."

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:55.760
 And whenever she sang, they almost always won.

00:05:55.760 --> 00:06:00.080
 They had a record of 100 wins and 29 losses

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:02.040
 and five ties whenever she sang.

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:04.160
 And normally it was more like 50/50.

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:06.120
 So all the other teams really hated her

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:09.200
 because she was just this amazingly good mascot

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:10.040
 for that team.

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:12.040
 But yeah, she was super famous Kate Smith.

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:13.360
 - I feel terrible.

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:15.080
 - I've described her as just an overweight lady

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:16.440
 trying to squeeze into her cinema seat.

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:18.000
 And she's basically the lovely charm

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:19.800
 of the whole United States.

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:20.800
 I'm so sorry.

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:23.160
 - But so that was the reason, wasn't it,

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:25.120
 for the whole invention of the drive-in.

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:28.680
 It was 1933, a guy called Richard Hollingshead

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:29.800
 was living in New Jersey

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:32.880
 and his mother found cinema seats uncomfortable

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:34.040
 and he wanted to fix that.

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:36.080
 So he thought if she could watch it

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:37.680
 from the comfort of her car,

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:39.240
 this would be a much better system.

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:41.800
 So he rigged up a sort of system

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:43.200
 for her to test it out on

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:45.320
 and it's so clever, these sort of innovation

00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:47.400
 that he did in the early days.

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:49.880
 Once he had the idea that this could be commercial,

00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:51.880
 the thought of, okay, how do I deal with it

00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:53.200
 if it's raining, for example?

00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:54.600
 So he would have his water hose

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:57.200
 and sprinkler systems going off in the background

00:06:57.200 --> 00:06:58.800
 while he tested different ways.

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:01.000
 He thought if cars were gonna be parked behind each other,

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:02.020
 how could they see each other?

00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:04.640
 So he tested out these sort of ramp systems

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:07.560
 whereby he could levitate, not levitate.

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:09.600
 - Oh no, no, no, he couldn't levitate.

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:12.240
 That would be an amazing innovation, wasn't it?

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:13.880
 When Guardian love your search.

00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:17.440
 - That's the helicopter driving your thinking of, Dan.

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:19.760
 Just on bringing your kids, this is a really clever thing

00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:22.320
 and how it was advertised.

00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:25.360
 Lots of cinemas put the playground for the children

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:27.040
 'cause the children might not want to sit and watch the film.

00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:28.960
 They put the playground under the screen.

00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:31.160
 So as you were watching the film as a parent,

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:33.200
 you could just check in and see your kids

00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:35.440
 directly beneath the cinema screen.

00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:36.520
 - That's so good.

00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:39.240
 - Although actually not everyone was happy about this idea

00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:40.680
 that you could bring your kids

00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:45.120
 because in 1947, there was a picket outside one

00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:48.440
 of the drive-ins by a load of babysitters

00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:53.440
 who said, "Down with drive-ins, more work for babysitters."

00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:57.720
 And while you drive in movie theaters, babysitters starve.

00:07:57.720 --> 00:08:01.120
 And so they were outside saying, "Down with drive-ins."

00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:03.040
 - Wow. - Because they were losing money.

00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:03.880
 - That's amazing. - It feels like

00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:05.040
 they've kind of won now.

00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:07.880
 It feels like babysitters have remained culturally necessary

00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:09.400
 in a way that drive-ins kind of haven't.

00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:10.680
 - That's true. - Yeah.

00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:13.200
 - Have you ever heard of another babysitter robot?

00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:15.360
 (all laughing)

00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:16.360
 - Is that unique?

00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:18.560
 - They're not very heavily unionized, the babysitters.

00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:20.640
 (all laughing)

00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:22.240
 - I think if I was a babysitter,

00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:27.240
 I would be really angry with recipe box services.

00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:28.760
 Because when I was a babysitter,

00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:31.880
 what you'd get is free reign of whatever was in the fridge.

00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:33.640
 But with those recipe boxes,

00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:35.800
 you only get exactly what you have to cook.

00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:37.200
 So there's never any spare food.

00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:40.000
 So it means babysitters are starving in that case.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:40.840
 - All right, James.

00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:43.160
 As an outfit that does some of the advertised hello fresh,

00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:45.440
 I don't know if we need to be putting babysitters off it,

00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:47.440
 driving a wedge between them.

00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:51.360
 - Well, these babysitters anyway, in near Seattle,

00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:52.400
 they picked it for a while,

00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:55.840
 but then they were bought off with a free movie and a hot dog.

00:08:55.840 --> 00:08:57.600
 - Wow. (all laughing)

00:08:57.600 --> 00:08:58.600
 - So cheekily bought.

00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:00.440
 - I think that's what they were going for.

00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:01.280
 - It could be.

00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:04.720
 - I don't think driving movies have ever been popular enough

00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:06.920
 that they've been putting babysitters out of business

00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:08.040
 on mass.

00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:10.240
 I think they just wanted a free film.

00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:12.240
 - You know, we know what the first movie was

00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:15.160
 to play the drive-in, which is quite cool.

00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:17.000
 So this was in 1933.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.600
 It's a movie called "Wives Beware".

00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:23.400
 And it is the story of a man who tires of married life

00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:25.720
 and he feigns memory loss

00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:28.560
 so that he can then pursue other women.

00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:29.760
 That's the whole plot.

00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:30.680
 So when his wife's like,

00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:32.240
 "Hey, you slept with that lady."

00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:33.320
 He goes, "Did I?"

00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:34.160
 That's weird.

00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:37.440
 And that was the movie.

00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:38.680
 And the reason they had that movie,

00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:40.440
 and this became the thing for drive-throughs,

00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:43.680
 was this was a movie that played in cinemas for one week

00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:45.480
 and then it went off cinemas.

00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:48.400
 And drive-throughs specifically were playing films

00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:50.800
 that were not in competition with the cinema.

00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:53.400
 It was the movies that were no longer on screen there.

00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:56.080
 And actually the popularity of it started dwindling

00:09:56.080 --> 00:09:58.800
 to more B movies and then erotic movies.

00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:01.160
 - But I think one of the reasons was as well though, Dan,

00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:02.720
 is that there was quite a union

00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:05.840
 between all of the different movie-making studios

00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:08.600
 and then America smashed it and whenever it was,

00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:10.240
 the '40s or '50s or something like that.

00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:13.760
 But before then, basically, if you weren't in on it,

00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:15.480
 you couldn't get the best movies.

00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:18.760
 And so all of the theaters really wanted to stop the drive-ins

00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:19.920
 from getting the best movies

00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:21.800
 'cause they thought that everyone would go to the drive-ins

00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:24.000
 instead of going to the theaters, I think.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.240
 - Yeah, I think they were more forced into the position,

00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:27.080
 weren't they?

00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:29.520
 Because no one would actually sell them the popular release.

00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:32.800
 And like Anna says, no one really cared what was on, right?

00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:35.000
 - No, they just went there to snog.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:36.280
 - They just went there to snog.

00:10:36.280 --> 00:10:38.440
 So there was a real big problem.

00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:41.280
 It wasn't just the baby sisters who didn't like the drive-ins.

00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:44.800
 It was also the puritanical people

00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:47.640
 'cause they were worried about nekkers.

00:10:47.640 --> 00:10:49.920
 So when the first one opened in Camden,

00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:51.680
 this first one, Hollingshead's one,

00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:53.560
 that we were talking about, a writer noted,

00:10:53.560 --> 00:10:55.720
 "Perhaps it will occur readily enough to the reader

00:10:55.720 --> 00:10:57.880
 "what fun young America could have

00:10:57.880 --> 00:11:00.280
 "in a coop under the added stimulation

00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:02.560
 "of a sophisticated romance."

00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:04.080
 So that was the first one that came

00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:05.200
 and they were already saying

00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:08.520
 that people might be snogging in the cars.

00:11:08.520 --> 00:11:11.200
 - They were very paranoid, weren't they?

00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:14.440
 - They were quite paranoid, but I mean, it did happen.

00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:16.840
 - Oh yeah, a lot of snogging went on.

00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:17.760
 - Yeah, one of the owners said,

00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:19.400
 "The only thing that can slow us down

00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:21.160
 "is an ugly rumour going around

00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:23.800
 "that the drive-in are perfect for nekkers."

00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:26.160
 - They did have people go around checking, didn't they?

00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:27.440
 - Checking for necking.

00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:29.560
 - They had necker checkers, yeah.

00:11:29.560 --> 00:11:31.280
 So a lot of them employed policemen

00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:33.120
 or just members of staff who had to go around

00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:34.880
 and look in people's windows

00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:37.760
 'cause they got this reputation as being passion pits.

00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:41.080
 And the reputation was from people called blue noses,

00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:42.120
 which I'd never heard before,

00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:46.440
 but it's a term for sort of prudish church types in America.

00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:49.440
 And various drive-ins would have rules

00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:50.440
 about what was allowed,

00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:53.040
 so one owner of a drive-in specified,

00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:56.080
 if a man puts his arm around a woman, that's okay,

00:11:56.080 --> 00:11:58.960
 but if she puts her arm back around him

00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:02.320
 and then they go into a clinch, that's out.

00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:04.720
 And then they're removed from the premises.

00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:06.360
 So that's where the line is.

00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:10.480
 - There was an actual law against it in 1972 in New Jersey,

00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:12.920
 which would find the operator $100

00:12:12.920 --> 00:12:14.840
 if any cars remained on the premises

00:12:14.840 --> 00:12:17.240
 one hour after the end of the show.

00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:19.200
 And they said that the reason was

00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:23.440
 because they didn't want any carbon monoxide deaths,

00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:25.840
 but actually it was just to stop the neckers.

00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:29.320
 - If you can't get your necking done within an hour, then, you know.

00:12:29.320 --> 00:12:31.320
 - I genuinely didn't know what the word "necking" meant,

00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:35.200
 so I Googled it, and apparently it's a short, plain, concave section

00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:36.640
 between the capital and the shaft

00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:39.120
 of a classical Doric-Ortuskin column,

00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:41.960
 but just in case people were hearing.

00:12:41.960 --> 00:12:46.800
 - You probably need a third person to be in the car with you

00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:49.000
 to not be caught out for necking, right?

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:52.040
 Because it's hard to see what's going on around you

00:12:52.040 --> 00:12:55.040
 when you're kissing, and generally,

00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:58.960
 kissing sort of etiquette means you have to have your eyes closed.

00:12:58.960 --> 00:13:01.320
 So if you had your eyes open while kissing,

00:13:01.320 --> 00:13:04.640
 A, you risk being a weirdo, but you are safer, I guess.

00:13:04.640 --> 00:13:06.720
 - If the other person has their eyes open as well,

00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:09.080
 then they're a weirdo, so you can usually get away with it

00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:10.440
 because they have their eyes closed.

00:13:10.440 --> 00:13:12.560
 - You're right, one person has to have their eyes open at all times

00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:14.360
 looking for blue noses,

00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:17.000
 and the other person gets on with removing their neckers.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:20.720
 - Well, no, you need both with eyes open because all you're getting

00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:23.520
 is you're getting that window only of your position.

00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:25.960
 - You can have a mini Periscope installed in the car,

00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:28.520
 and then you can just see all the way around you at all times.

00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:30.640
 - Oh, that's cool. In which case, you only need one eye open.

00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:32.960
 - I don't want to be a female in the car with you, Andy,

00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:34.640
 when you say Periscope up.

00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:36.880
 (laughing)

00:13:36.880 --> 00:13:40.920
 The second ever drive-in was built by a man called

00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:42.520
 Wilson Shankwaila.

00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:44.480
 It was, wow.

00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:47.160
 He was from Pennsylvania,

00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:51.960
 and they tried to stop it by taxing him,

00:13:51.960 --> 00:13:55.560
 and so they wanted to give him a massive amusement tax,

00:13:55.560 --> 00:13:58.560
 and he tried to avoid it by advertising it as

00:13:58.560 --> 00:14:01.400
 free movies parking 50 cents.

00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:04.240
 So it was like, he advertised it as just a parking lot

00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:06.680
 that just happens to have free movies happening.

00:14:06.680 --> 00:14:08.040
 - That's what he did.

00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:10.200
 - Shankwaila is another activity that was banned.

00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:12.440
 (laughing)

00:14:12.440 --> 00:14:18.440
 - Okay, it is time for fact number two, and that is my fact.

00:14:18.440 --> 00:14:21.280
 My fact this week is that the Beatles once rejected

00:14:21.280 --> 00:14:25.040
 a 50 million pound reunion gig because the Warm-Up Act

00:14:25.040 --> 00:14:28.560
 was going to be a man wrestling a great white shark.

00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:30.680
 This is according to Ringo Starr,

00:14:30.680 --> 00:14:33.160
 who revealed this in an interview recently

00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:35.280
 in the lead-up to his 80th birthday,

00:14:35.280 --> 00:14:38.440
 and he was talking about how back in 1975,

00:14:38.440 --> 00:14:42.480
 they were approached by a incredible character

00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:46.680
 called Bill Sargent, who wanted to reunite them,

00:14:46.680 --> 00:14:48.680
 and he had 50 million pounds,

00:14:48.680 --> 00:14:51.440
 which is roughly 200 million pounds in today's money,

00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:53.600
 and the idea was for them to do this gig,

00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:55.480
 and according to the Beatles,

00:14:55.480 --> 00:14:58.400
 the pitch was that it was going to be a Warm-Up Act

00:14:58.400 --> 00:15:00.840
 of a man underwater fighting a shark.

00:15:00.840 --> 00:15:04.760
 Now, I think Ringo's muddled this story a bit.

00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:06.400
 I don't think that great white shark

00:15:06.400 --> 00:15:07.640
 was going to be the Warm-Up Act.

00:15:07.640 --> 00:15:08.960
 However, Bill Sargent--

00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:11.440
 - No, you put the great white shark on last.

00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:13.200
 - Of course, there's no way the Beatles

00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:15.200
 can follow a man fighting a shark.

00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:17.000
 It's going to be such a letdown for the audience.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:18.560
 Even the Beatles reuniting.

00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:19.840
 - You've got a man with a shark,

00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:22.120
 and then some people saying, "I am a walrus."

00:15:22.120 --> 00:15:23.760
 Come on.

00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:25.400
 - Octopus' garden.

00:15:25.400 --> 00:15:26.680
 Now, desperately trying to think of--

00:15:26.680 --> 00:15:28.320
 they would have needed a yellow submarine

00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:31.120
 in order to get to the stage.

00:15:31.120 --> 00:15:33.320
 I can play this all night.

00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:34.520
 - OK, we can wait.

00:15:34.520 --> 00:15:35.960
 I'll leave for another one.

00:15:35.960 --> 00:15:38.840
 [laughter]

00:15:38.840 --> 00:15:41.200
 Also, I'm not sure he had 50 million dollars,

00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:43.520
 'cause he was like the father of pay-per-view, wasn't he?

00:15:43.520 --> 00:15:46.000
 So his idea was that he would put it on,

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:47.920
 and then people would pay to watch it,

00:15:47.920 --> 00:15:49.800
 and then the Beatles would get the money from that one day.

00:15:49.800 --> 00:15:51.640
 - Oh. - I think so.

00:15:51.640 --> 00:15:53.200
 - I see. - But he said--

00:15:53.200 --> 00:15:55.600
 there was an interview with him in 1976,

00:15:55.600 --> 00:15:57.800
 and he said, "I definitely asked them to do this,

00:15:57.800 --> 00:16:00.200
 and as far as I know, they're considering it."

00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:02.800
 But he said that the problem was that Paul McCartney

00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:04.760
 was about to start a US tour,

00:16:04.760 --> 00:16:07.960
 a 20-day US tour that was going to be huge for McCartney,

00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:11.560
 and that it was because he didn't want to bring the Beatles

00:16:11.560 --> 00:16:14.000
 back together quite yet that it didn't happen.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.000
 That was quite a sergeant.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:19.200
 James, I don't know if we read the same thing about Bill Sargent.

00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:21.600
 I was reading People magazine from 1976.

00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:23.320
 - Same article. - Nice.

00:16:23.320 --> 00:16:25.560
 I reckon probably about 15 years,

00:16:25.560 --> 00:16:27.000
 no one else has read that article,

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:28.720
 and then four people read it this week.

00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:30.280
 [laughter]

00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:32.320
 The People and People magazine are going to be so excited

00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:33.400
 by the sudden boost.

00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:35.520
 Yeah. Do you think the office, there was a ping noise

00:16:35.520 --> 00:16:37.080
 that went on four times?

00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:39.000
 [laughter]

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:42.000
 But it was so funny, 'cause it reported that this guy,

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.400
 Bill Sargent, had made and lost a million dollars

00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:46.600
 seven times over, and he'd also had two heart attacks.

00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:49.160
 And then it said, "As of now, the Beatles seem more likely

00:16:49.160 --> 00:16:51.440
 to provide Sargent with coronary number three

00:16:51.440 --> 00:16:53.200
 than fortune number eight."

00:16:53.200 --> 00:16:56.240
 Yeah, and actually, the guy who bought the Great Work Shark,

00:16:56.240 --> 00:16:58.760
 I think, might have caused another coronary,

00:16:58.760 --> 00:17:01.760
 because that was also supposed to happen

00:17:01.760 --> 00:17:04.000
 as a pay-per-view thing, and they even made the posters

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:06.000
 and everything, but Bill Sargent had a heart attack

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:07.560
 before they could do it, and so they...

00:17:07.560 --> 00:17:09.200
 - Oh, yeah. - Yeah.

00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:12.760
 I actually found the press release that they issued

00:17:12.760 --> 00:17:16.880
 to companies around the world about this big fight,

00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:18.640
 and it's remarkable reading.

00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:20.160
 It's about six pages long.

00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:22.960
 It's written in such great, so in the most unusual,

00:17:22.960 --> 00:17:25.160
 deaf-defying event ever to come to the screen,

00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:27.600
 Bill Sargent has announced that he will bring a life fight

00:17:27.600 --> 00:17:29.120
 to the death between a single man

00:17:29.120 --> 00:17:31.120
 and a giant live man-eating shark

00:17:31.120 --> 00:17:33.520
 to theater, arena, and coliseum screens

00:17:33.520 --> 00:17:35.960
 by satellite closed-circuit television.

00:17:35.960 --> 00:17:38.360
 And it was a guy called Wally Gibbons,

00:17:38.360 --> 00:17:40.280
 who was a shark expert,

00:17:40.280 --> 00:17:43.240
 and he was gonna be given a spear,

00:17:43.240 --> 00:17:45.880
 and that is how he was gonna fight the shark.

00:17:45.880 --> 00:17:47.280
 And the sharks, three of them,

00:17:47.280 --> 00:17:49.720
 were gonna be brought five weeks early to Samoa,

00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:51.480
 where the fight was gonna occur,

00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:53.760
 so they could acclimatize to the water,

00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:56.920
 and in the 48 hours leading up to the fight,

00:17:56.920 --> 00:17:58.640
 they were gonna be starved.

00:17:58.640 --> 00:18:02.280
 So Wally was gonna have to fight a starving shark,

00:18:02.280 --> 00:18:05.200
 and he said a lot about, in this press release,

00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:07.200
 about what he thought his odds were of surviving.

00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:10.280
 He thought if he could shoot the shark with the speargun

00:18:10.280 --> 00:18:13.160
 first time and get him, that was gonna bring the odds up,

00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:16.280
 but he needed to shoot it about five times to kill it.

00:18:16.280 --> 00:18:19.000
 -But what about the two other sharks? -Yeah.

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:20.960
 -They were backup sharks. -They're holding the towel

00:18:20.960 --> 00:18:23.400
 and the bucket and they're holding it.

00:18:23.400 --> 00:18:25.560
 Can I ask you, Addy, if you're in the water,

00:18:25.560 --> 00:18:27.400
 what are you keeping in the bucket?

00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:28.400
 I don't know.

00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:33.160
 I don't think it would have defied death.

00:18:33.160 --> 00:18:34.880
 I think it would have really embraced death.

00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:37.560
 I have a suspicion that old Wally, the absolute Wally,

00:18:37.560 --> 00:18:39.680
 would have died within maybe five seconds.

00:18:39.680 --> 00:18:41.120
 -Ah. -Because I don't think...

00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:43.280
 -Do you think? -Yeah, I think so, because...

00:18:43.280 --> 00:18:44.280
 I don't know.

00:18:44.280 --> 00:18:47.120
 I think that he tried this a few times,

00:18:47.120 --> 00:18:49.160
 because there was someone called Geoffrey Mann,

00:18:49.160 --> 00:18:52.600
 who wrote a book later in life about Bill Sargent

00:18:52.600 --> 00:18:55.080
 trying to get him to fight a shark in Samoa as well,

00:18:55.080 --> 00:18:57.680
 which you've got to assume is the same kind of setup.

00:18:57.680 --> 00:19:00.800
 And apparently that was cancelled, according to this guy,

00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:03.480
 cancelled last minute by Jack Cousteau,

00:19:03.480 --> 00:19:06.720
 who... I don't know what he was doing, being involved in the event,

00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:09.280
 but a famed oceanographer, Jack Cousteau,

00:19:09.280 --> 00:19:11.320
 cancelled this shark fight.

00:19:11.320 --> 00:19:13.400
 But he was going to have a knife,

00:19:13.400 --> 00:19:15.360
 which I think is going to be quite similar to a spear.

00:19:15.360 --> 00:19:18.120
 And in the end, I was looking up how you'd kill a shark

00:19:18.120 --> 00:19:19.760
 if you faced it.

00:19:19.760 --> 00:19:23.080
 And stabbing it is the worst possible thing you can do,

00:19:23.080 --> 00:19:24.680
 according to a guy called William Johnson.

00:19:24.680 --> 00:19:27.160
 It's not the worst. The worst thing is to climb into its mouth.

00:19:27.160 --> 00:19:28.160
 Yeah.

00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:30.720
 He actually does say, when he's giving advice, he says,

00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:33.160
 "Go for the face and gills, because they're quite sensitive."

00:19:33.160 --> 00:19:34.840
 So, you know, like punching them in the face.

00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:37.080
 But do try to keep your hands out of its mouth.

00:19:37.080 --> 00:19:38.680
 That's always the best thing.

00:19:38.680 --> 00:19:41.400
 But Wally Gibbons was an interesting guy, wasn't he?

00:19:41.400 --> 00:19:46.600
 Like, there was a 1952 contest between fishermen and spearmen,

00:19:46.600 --> 00:19:49.640
 which were people who caught fish with spears.

00:19:49.640 --> 00:19:53.600
 And he caught more fish than all the 37 fishermen

00:19:53.600 --> 00:19:55.520
 who were in that competition on his own.

00:19:55.520 --> 00:19:56.760
 Wow.

00:19:56.760 --> 00:19:59.400
 He was amazing. And just after World War II,

00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:01.800
 he swam around the Solomon Islands,

00:20:01.800 --> 00:20:04.920
 picking up, like, unexploded shells,

00:20:04.920 --> 00:20:07.520
 and then taking them away so that they wouldn't affect people

00:20:07.520 --> 00:20:09.800
 in the future. Isn't that amazing, Wally?

00:20:09.800 --> 00:20:11.640
 That's really cool. Yeah, he was incredible.

00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:14.280
 There's a biography in this press release where they say

00:20:14.280 --> 00:20:17.880
 that he has killed more sharks in man-to-fish underwater combat

00:20:17.880 --> 00:20:21.680
 than any other man in Australia and possibly in the world.

00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:25.640
 I mean, so, yeah, I find it unlikely that anyone from

00:20:25.640 --> 00:20:28.080
 anywhere else in Australia would have killed any sharks

00:20:28.080 --> 00:20:29.000
 in man-to-fish fights.

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:30.160
 And it should sign, probably, that.

00:20:30.160 --> 00:20:32.600
 Yeah, he was known as a man-fish.

00:20:32.600 --> 00:20:34.240
 That's what they called him.

00:20:34.240 --> 00:20:35.840
 Merman. We've got a name for a mountain fish.

00:20:35.840 --> 00:20:37.560
 It's a merman.

00:20:37.560 --> 00:20:41.160
 Wally Gibbons also had the best collection of seashells

00:20:41.160 --> 00:20:42.760
 in the whole of Australia.

00:20:42.760 --> 00:20:45.200
 He had the world's rarest shell.

00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:47.800
 He owned it, the Gloria Maris,

00:20:47.800 --> 00:20:50.720
 which is also known as the Glory of the Seacone.

00:20:50.720 --> 00:20:54.080
 And that shell used to be so rare

00:20:54.080 --> 00:20:57.240
 that there was once a collector who bought one in an auction

00:20:57.240 --> 00:21:00.520
 only to immediately destroy it so that he had the only one

00:21:00.520 --> 00:21:02.480
 because he found this other one that was...

00:21:02.480 --> 00:21:04.920
 He didn't want two in the world to exist,

00:21:04.920 --> 00:21:06.840
 so he bought one in the auction when it came up

00:21:06.840 --> 00:21:09.040
 and he destroyed it, so he had the only one.

00:21:09.040 --> 00:21:09.840
 That's pretty sick.

00:21:09.840 --> 00:21:11.920
 Supposedly, that was in 1792.

00:21:11.920 --> 00:21:14.960
 But then there was only a few of them in the world.

00:21:14.960 --> 00:21:16.640
 Wally Gibbons had one of them.

00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:20.800
 And when proper scuba diving got invented, they found...

00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:22.080
 Oh, yeah, they're just down there.

00:21:22.080 --> 00:21:24.680
 They were just a bit lower than we could normally go.

00:21:24.680 --> 00:21:27.080
 So people, you can collect them quite easily now.

00:21:27.080 --> 00:21:29.120
 You could buy them for not too much.

00:21:29.120 --> 00:21:31.760
 I think that would be a disappointing

00:21:31.760 --> 00:21:33.680
 if the shark fight couldn't go ahead.

00:21:33.680 --> 00:21:36.200
 But he said, "But don't worry, Wally Gibbons

00:21:36.200 --> 00:21:39.400
 "will be showing you his seashell collection."

00:21:39.400 --> 00:21:42.880
 Because I was thinking, Anna said that he would die after five minutes.

00:21:42.880 --> 00:21:44.640
 If you're the Beatles and you're thinking,

00:21:44.640 --> 00:21:47.200
 "Okay, we're going on in an hour after the fight."

00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:48.680
 And then after five minutes, they're like,

00:21:48.680 --> 00:21:50.320
 "Well, sorry, the guy just got eaten,

00:21:50.320 --> 00:21:51.640
 "so you're going to have to go on early."

00:21:51.640 --> 00:21:52.920
 I'd be pretty pissed off.

00:21:52.920 --> 00:21:55.880
 Also, there's a bit of a weird vibe in the audience right now.

00:21:55.880 --> 00:21:58.280
 (LAUGHTER)

00:21:58.280 --> 00:22:00.120
 They probably had a back-up, warmer-backed,

00:22:00.120 --> 00:22:02.080
 which was a therapist to come out on stage

00:22:02.080 --> 00:22:05.880
 to help everyone deal with the massacre they'd just seen.

00:22:05.880 --> 00:22:09.240
 Can I just say one weird, interesting thing about Bill Sargent,

00:22:09.240 --> 00:22:10.920
 the guy who Dan mentioned at the start,

00:22:10.920 --> 00:22:12.800
 who was organising the shark fights.

00:22:12.800 --> 00:22:14.960
 So he was an inventor. He invented tons of stuff.

00:22:14.960 --> 00:22:18.720
 He had, I think, over 400 patents, so gadget patents.

00:22:18.720 --> 00:22:20.720
 And one thing that I think he invented

00:22:20.720 --> 00:22:23.960
 is something that we think of as new, which is televised theatre.

00:22:23.960 --> 00:22:26.760
 So, you know, now you can go and see the National Theatre Live

00:22:26.760 --> 00:22:28.160
 at your local cinema,

00:22:28.160 --> 00:22:31.200
 or you could before the theatre stopped happening.

00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:33.400
 And he invented the precursor to this called

00:22:33.400 --> 00:22:36.840
 "Electronovision" in the 1960s.

00:22:36.840 --> 00:22:40.720
 And so, basically, it involved him going in and videotaping plays

00:22:40.720 --> 00:22:43.000
 and then broadcasting them in cinemas.

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:44.560
 And he made loads of money out of it.

00:22:44.560 --> 00:22:49.440
 And the first one he did was a tape of Richard Burton in Hamlet in 1964.

00:22:49.440 --> 00:22:50.920
 And he filmed three separate productions,

00:22:50.920 --> 00:22:53.640
 then edited them together to get the best best of.

00:22:53.640 --> 00:22:58.280
 Highlights showed in 1,000 cinemas and made him millions of dollars.

00:22:58.280 --> 00:22:59.280
 Amazing.

00:22:59.280 --> 00:23:01.840
 Bill Sargent's first job was a radio repairman,

00:23:01.840 --> 00:23:04.200
 which he had at the age of six.

00:23:04.200 --> 00:23:07.160
 - Wow. - So he started work at the age of six.

00:23:07.160 --> 00:23:09.400
 In fairness, it was in the family workshop,

00:23:09.400 --> 00:23:11.680
 which was attached to his family home.

00:23:11.680 --> 00:23:15.000
 Unfortunately, a year later, he burnt them both down by accident.

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:18.040
 And then later on, when he got a load of money for his movies,

00:23:18.040 --> 00:23:20.920
 he set up an electronics laboratory in Missouri.

00:23:20.920 --> 00:23:23.080
 But then he burned that down as well.

00:23:23.080 --> 00:23:26.440
 So he had kind of had a habit of burning down electronic shops.

00:23:26.440 --> 00:23:30.040
 That time, when he burned down the second one, James,

00:23:30.040 --> 00:23:33.640
 apparently it was because he put down, just not really thinking,

00:23:33.640 --> 00:23:36.280
 he put down a welding torch in the wrong place.

00:23:36.280 --> 00:23:39.400
 He put it onto a drum of paint thinner or thinner.

00:23:39.400 --> 00:23:42.320
 So kind of the winch is obviously highly flammable.

00:23:42.320 --> 00:23:44.240
 According, I guess, to him,

00:23:44.240 --> 00:23:45.880
 because I don't think there were many other people around,

00:23:45.880 --> 00:23:48.760
 he was blown 170 feet into the air.

00:23:48.760 --> 00:23:53.280
 - What's 170 feet? - No.

00:23:53.280 --> 00:23:56.320
 - That's impossible. - Someone's flying over to the drive-in fare

00:23:56.320 --> 00:23:57.840
 to go, "What the fuck was that?"

00:23:57.840 --> 00:24:01.840
 (LAUGHTER)

00:24:01.840 --> 00:24:04.320
 - 170 feet. - Yep, that's what he says.

00:24:04.320 --> 00:24:05.320
 Well...

00:24:05.320 --> 00:24:07.440
 I love him. Love this man so much.

00:24:07.440 --> 00:24:10.000
 So this thing of a man fighting a shark

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:13.800
 was basically an insane, weird, warm-up act.

00:24:13.800 --> 00:24:16.000
 And so I looked into a few other weird acts,

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:19.160
 like kind of vaudeville acts from, you know, the last century.

00:24:19.160 --> 00:24:21.360
 So have you heard of Haji Ali,

00:24:21.360 --> 00:24:23.840
 who was also known as the Egyptian enigma?

00:24:23.840 --> 00:24:25.760
 - Oh? - He was amazing.

00:24:25.760 --> 00:24:27.360
 OK, so he was a vaudeville performer.

00:24:27.360 --> 00:24:30.600
 His act was to swallow kerosene,

00:24:30.600 --> 00:24:33.160
 then he would swallow some water, OK?

00:24:33.160 --> 00:24:35.360
 Then he would regurgitate the kerosene

00:24:35.360 --> 00:24:37.960
 and set it on fire, as he did so.

00:24:37.960 --> 00:24:41.560
 But then he would regurgitate the water to put out the fire

00:24:41.560 --> 00:24:43.520
 that he had lit from the kerosene.

00:24:43.520 --> 00:24:46.240
 - So cool. - I think he was also known as the human volcano.

00:24:46.240 --> 00:24:47.480
 Or something like that.

00:24:47.480 --> 00:24:49.120
 And then there's just one line about him saying

00:24:49.120 --> 00:24:52.040
 he would also regurgitate live goldfish and nuts.

00:24:52.040 --> 00:24:54.640
 (LAUGHTER)

00:24:54.640 --> 00:24:57.480
 The nuts was actually more impressive than it sounds, wasn't it,

00:24:57.480 --> 00:24:59.280
 with Haji Ali, because he...

00:24:59.280 --> 00:25:01.280
 One of his tricks was being able to regurgitate stuff

00:25:01.280 --> 00:25:03.080
 in the order specified by the audience.

00:25:03.080 --> 00:25:05.040
 So he'd swallow a bunch of objects and then be like,

00:25:05.040 --> 00:25:08.120
 "All right, bring up the goldfish now. OK, bring up your braces."

00:25:08.120 --> 00:25:11.840
 And so he'd swallow, for instance, 50 hazelnuts

00:25:11.840 --> 00:25:13.840
 and one almond.

00:25:13.840 --> 00:25:16.040
 And he'd start regurgitating them one by one.

00:25:16.040 --> 00:25:18.920
 And when an audience member said, "Bring up the almond now, mate,"

00:25:18.920 --> 00:25:20.840
 he'd call the almond up.

00:25:20.840 --> 00:25:22.840
 - And within. - It's amazing.

00:25:22.840 --> 00:25:24.520
 - Apparently. - Oh, my God.

00:25:24.520 --> 00:25:27.880
 I genuinely think if you gave me a bowl of nuts

00:25:27.880 --> 00:25:29.640
 and said, "Which one of those is an almond?"

00:25:29.640 --> 00:25:30.640
 I would struggle.

00:25:30.640 --> 00:25:31.840
 (LAUGHTER)

00:25:31.840 --> 00:25:33.640
 Maybe that's what he was relying on.

00:25:33.640 --> 00:25:35.800
 He just told the audience it was an almond.

00:25:35.800 --> 00:25:37.040
 (LAUGHTER)

00:25:37.040 --> 00:25:40.640
 I can say one more Borderville thing related to animals.

00:25:40.640 --> 00:25:42.560
 And this was an amazing act,

00:25:42.560 --> 00:25:45.480
 which was a group of women called the Barrison Sisters.

00:25:45.480 --> 00:25:48.000
 And it seems like their entire act

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:50.560
 was to do a little bit of a sexy dance

00:25:50.560 --> 00:25:52.200
 that gets more and more sexy.

00:25:52.200 --> 00:25:54.080
 And all the way through, they would ask the audience,

00:25:54.080 --> 00:25:56.240
 "Would you like to see my pussy?"

00:25:56.240 --> 00:25:58.600
 And then when eventually, the audience said, "Yes,"

00:25:58.600 --> 00:26:02.440
 they would lift their skirts and they would all have a cat in their knickers.

00:26:02.440 --> 00:26:03.800
 (LAUGHTER)

00:26:03.800 --> 00:26:07.040
 And that was absolutely massive.

00:26:07.040 --> 00:26:08.680
 They were huge.

00:26:08.680 --> 00:26:10.640
 They were so famous, these people.

00:26:10.640 --> 00:26:14.040
 They played Berlin for eight months with this act.

00:26:14.040 --> 00:26:16.040
 (LAUGHTER)

00:26:16.040 --> 00:26:18.680
 - They played a... - But is it like the mousetrap, James?

00:26:18.680 --> 00:26:21.440
 Are they like, "Please don't tell anyone the spoiler when you leave?"

00:26:21.440 --> 00:26:23.840
 It must be, right? It must be that.

00:26:23.840 --> 00:26:25.680
 They must have been exactly like that.

00:26:25.680 --> 00:26:28.440
 And there was a French nobleman who committed suicide

00:26:28.440 --> 00:26:30.560
 because he loved one of them so much.

00:26:30.560 --> 00:26:33.680
 And they were so shocking that after the eight months in Berlin,

00:26:33.680 --> 00:26:36.560
 they were banned from ever re-entering Germany.

00:26:36.560 --> 00:26:39.440
 I love the fact that they waited eight months to ban them.

00:26:39.440 --> 00:26:41.680
 It's like, "Okay, now that everyone in Germany

00:26:41.680 --> 00:26:43.840
 "has had a chance to see you, now you're banned."

00:26:43.840 --> 00:26:46.000
 Because now that's not appropriate.

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:49.320
 The censors went countless times, thousands of times.

00:26:49.320 --> 00:26:51.280
 Yeah, we're just trying to assess whether or not

00:26:51.280 --> 00:26:53.480
 it really is offensive enough to ban.

00:26:53.480 --> 00:26:57.360
 Just like a few more months of seeing them, to be sure.

00:26:57.360 --> 00:26:59.280
 - Were the cats alive? - Yeah, they were alive.

00:26:59.280 --> 00:27:02.160
 They were in, like, a little pouch over their crutches.

00:27:02.160 --> 00:27:06.160
 So the cats had to sit there in between their legs for the full act.

00:27:06.160 --> 00:27:07.480
 - They must have been sedated. - Yeah.

00:27:07.480 --> 00:27:10.800
 I don't know whether they regurgitated them somehow or what,

00:27:10.800 --> 00:27:12.600
 but they were definitely there.

00:27:12.600 --> 00:27:13.920
 And there was an article about them,

00:27:13.920 --> 00:27:16.320
 and one guy in New York said,

00:27:16.320 --> 00:27:19.960
 "It was the most audacious piece of devilry and abandonment

00:27:19.960 --> 00:27:23.200
 "I ever saw offered to a New York public."

00:27:23.200 --> 00:27:24.200
 Wow.

00:27:24.200 --> 00:27:25.800
 I really thought you were going to say that he committed suicide

00:27:25.800 --> 00:27:28.400
 because he was so disappointed when they lifted up their skirts

00:27:28.400 --> 00:27:30.440
 at the end, and he didn't see their vaginas.

00:27:30.440 --> 00:27:32.440
 Yeah.

00:27:32.440 --> 00:27:35.440
 Just ask only a cat.

00:27:35.440 --> 00:27:37.440
 It's all been for nothing.

00:27:37.440 --> 00:27:42.880
 OK, it's time for fact number three, and that is Anna.

00:27:42.880 --> 00:27:45.240
 My fact this week is that in 1919,

00:27:45.240 --> 00:27:48.840
 it was ruled that women would be allowed to swim competitively

00:27:48.840 --> 00:27:51.880
 without wearing stockings on the one condition

00:27:51.880 --> 00:27:55.480
 that they quickly put on a robe as soon as they got out of the water.

00:27:55.480 --> 00:27:59.280
 And this was specifically in America.

00:27:59.280 --> 00:28:01.400
 And I think these are nylon stockings,

00:28:01.400 --> 00:28:03.880
 because there weren't been any nylon in 1919, would they?

00:28:03.880 --> 00:28:05.880
 So was it wool or what?

00:28:05.880 --> 00:28:06.880
 I think they were wool.

00:28:06.880 --> 00:28:10.280
 I think quite a lot of people had to wear woolen stuff in the water.

00:28:10.280 --> 00:28:13.320
 That's not going to be conducive to a quick swim, is it?

00:28:13.320 --> 00:28:15.520
 It's like carrying a sheep while you're swimming.

00:28:15.520 --> 00:28:16.520
 Yeah.

00:28:16.520 --> 00:28:19.240
 It's like that, did you guys all do that swimming survival test

00:28:19.240 --> 00:28:21.280
 when you were younger, where you had to wear pyjamas in the water?

00:28:21.280 --> 00:28:23.080
 It was like every time a woman swam in the water,

00:28:23.080 --> 00:28:25.440
 it was like having to do that survival test.

00:28:25.440 --> 00:28:27.520
 In every Olympics, they had to pick up a brick

00:28:27.520 --> 00:28:29.560
 from the bottom of the pool, didn't they?

00:28:29.560 --> 00:28:31.040
 Yeah.

00:28:31.040 --> 00:28:35.120
 So this was in America, and it was the Amateur Athletics Union,

00:28:35.120 --> 00:28:37.520
 which had only recently allowed women to take part

00:28:37.520 --> 00:28:39.840
 in competitive swimming events anyway.

00:28:39.840 --> 00:28:43.160
 But it was very controversial what women would wear in the water,

00:28:43.160 --> 00:28:47.920
 and they essentially had to be covered from neck to toe fully.

00:28:47.920 --> 00:28:49.440
 And this irritated the women,

00:28:49.440 --> 00:28:52.640
 because they realised that this would put them at a massive disadvantage

00:28:52.640 --> 00:28:53.920
 in the Olympics, for instance,

00:28:53.920 --> 00:28:56.640
 when they were competing against other countries like Australia,

00:28:56.640 --> 00:28:58.840
 who were a bit looser with their regulations,

00:28:58.840 --> 00:29:03.360
 and they would be weighed down by their massive cotton waterlogs

00:29:03.360 --> 00:29:06.560
 and head-to-toe outfits while the Aussies were smashing them.

00:29:06.560 --> 00:29:08.920
 So there was sort of a campaign.

00:29:08.920 --> 00:29:11.080
 There was this amazing woman called Charlotte Epstein,

00:29:11.080 --> 00:29:12.840
 who was a court stenographer, actually,

00:29:12.840 --> 00:29:17.040
 and she'd formed the Women's Swimming Association in 1917.

00:29:17.040 --> 00:29:21.400
 And she campaigned to have the stocking requirement removed.

00:29:21.400 --> 00:29:23.160
 And eventually she did this stunt,

00:29:23.160 --> 00:29:25.960
 where she invited some of the best women in the country,

00:29:25.960 --> 00:29:27.400
 female swimmers in the country,

00:29:27.400 --> 00:29:29.440
 to come to a beach in California

00:29:29.440 --> 00:29:32.960
 and strip down to ordinary swimsuits without stockings.

00:29:32.960 --> 00:29:34.440
 And they were all arrested.

00:29:34.440 --> 00:29:37.520
 And she invited the tabloids to see them all be arrested.

00:29:37.520 --> 00:29:40.760
 And this kind of created this atmosphere of how ridiculous is this?

00:29:40.760 --> 00:29:42.960
 Women are just being arrested for wearing swimming costumes.

00:29:42.960 --> 00:29:45.480
 Come on, guys, sort your shit out.

00:29:45.480 --> 00:29:46.880
 And so they relaxed the rules.

00:29:46.880 --> 00:29:50.520
 But you did have to very quickly put on a robe as soon as you emerged.

00:29:50.520 --> 00:29:53.560
 Yeah, the rules were pretty strict, weren't they, back in the day?

00:29:53.560 --> 00:29:57.160
 Like, in 1921, in New York,

00:29:57.160 --> 00:30:01.480
 everyone had to wear a two-piece swimming suit, everyone.

00:30:01.480 --> 00:30:04.520
 And there was a specific law that made it illegal

00:30:04.520 --> 00:30:07.200
 for any bold men to stare at women.

00:30:07.200 --> 00:30:09.720
 Yeah, I saw that. What does that mean?

00:30:09.720 --> 00:30:11.160
 I couldn't find...

00:30:11.160 --> 00:30:14.480
 I think that was one person on the beach,

00:30:14.480 --> 00:30:16.360
 like the person who was monitoring that beach,

00:30:16.360 --> 00:30:19.920
 who thought that bold men were sort of equated with perverts.

00:30:19.920 --> 00:30:22.800
 And he said, "I'm going to stop bold men from staring at women."

00:30:22.800 --> 00:30:24.200
 It's so strange.

00:30:24.200 --> 00:30:27.480
 Maybe there was a specific bold man that they were worried about,

00:30:27.480 --> 00:30:30.040
 like, Stairy Steve, and they sort of said,

00:30:30.040 --> 00:30:32.600
 "Well, we can't say Stairy Steve is found from the beach,

00:30:32.600 --> 00:30:34.320
 "but we will say this."

00:30:34.320 --> 00:30:37.240
 Yeah, well, weren't hats very popular back then?

00:30:37.240 --> 00:30:39.200
 So maybe bold means a hatless,

00:30:39.200 --> 00:30:43.640
 because maybe they were taking their hat down to hide a protrusion below.

00:30:43.640 --> 00:30:47.840
 Is that how, you know, how they always say in the olden days,

00:30:47.840 --> 00:30:50.240
 whenever you met a lady, you had to lift your hat?

00:30:50.240 --> 00:30:53.360
 It wasn't to hide your protrusion, Dan.

00:30:53.360 --> 00:30:57.200
 The taller the hat, the bigger the brag.

00:30:57.200 --> 00:31:00.320
 You remember Mr. Darcy always had a very tall top hat.

00:31:00.320 --> 00:31:02.920
 But that's how you catch them, is that you just say,

00:31:02.920 --> 00:31:04.120
 "Can you show me your hands, please?"

00:31:04.120 --> 00:31:06.640
 And if the hat stays where it is on their lap,

00:31:06.640 --> 00:31:09.760
 then you know that there's a protrusion situation.

00:31:09.760 --> 00:31:14.440
 In the Olympics, the first time that women swam in the Olympics,

00:31:14.440 --> 00:31:16.280
 I think, was in 1912.

00:31:16.280 --> 00:31:19.960
 And the British team had to wear a bra and knickers

00:31:19.960 --> 00:31:22.200
 while they swam, as well as their swimsuit.

00:31:22.200 --> 00:31:26.360
 And that's because they had this amazingly awesome silk swimsuit

00:31:26.360 --> 00:31:28.480
 that would help them to swim really fast.

00:31:28.480 --> 00:31:31.480
 But it was completely see-through when it got wet.

00:31:31.480 --> 00:31:33.120
 And so, I mean, it was amazing.

00:31:33.120 --> 00:31:35.320
 It was so thin, the silk,

00:31:35.320 --> 00:31:37.760
 that you could take the whole thing and pass it through a wedding ring.

00:31:37.760 --> 00:31:40.040
 That's how thin the material was.

00:31:40.040 --> 00:31:42.080
 But it did have that one problem that it was see-through,

00:31:42.080 --> 00:31:43.800
 so you had to wear underwear as well.

00:31:43.800 --> 00:31:47.360
 And was it a Superman situation where it's on top of the outfit?

00:31:48.360 --> 00:31:50.480
 I've seen the pictures and they were on the inside,

00:31:50.480 --> 00:31:52.640
 but definitely they should have gone the outside, shouldn't they?

00:31:52.640 --> 00:31:53.640
 Yeah.

00:31:53.640 --> 00:31:56.880
 I find it really bizarre that women weren't encouraged to swim

00:31:56.880 --> 00:31:58.280
 until about the 19th century.

00:31:58.280 --> 00:32:03.280
 So this only really became a situation then or late on then,

00:32:03.280 --> 00:32:06.800
 because before that, if you were a woman, you just didn't swim.

00:32:06.800 --> 00:32:09.440
 I thought there's very little evidence of women swimming

00:32:09.440 --> 00:32:11.280
 before the 17th century.

00:32:11.280 --> 00:32:12.600
 There is some.

00:32:12.600 --> 00:32:16.360
 Yeah, I found the description of a standard ladies' bathing costume

00:32:16.360 --> 00:32:20.400
 in 1687 by someone called Celia Fiennes,

00:32:20.400 --> 00:32:24.080
 who said it was made of fine yellow canvas,

00:32:24.080 --> 00:32:26.560
 which made it that when you went in the water,

00:32:26.560 --> 00:32:27.920
 it filled up with water,

00:32:27.920 --> 00:32:30.440
 so no one could see the shape of your body.

00:32:30.440 --> 00:32:31.440
 Crafty.

00:32:31.440 --> 00:32:33.320
 I'm clever, like a Mr. Blobby costume.

00:32:33.320 --> 00:32:36.600
 A Mr. Blobby, yeah, because you can never tell how sexy

00:32:36.600 --> 00:32:39.080
 the person playing Mr. Blobby is, can't you?

00:32:39.080 --> 00:32:42.200
 They don't need to be sexy on the inside

00:32:42.200 --> 00:32:45.320
 if they're wearing a Mr. Blobby costume, I'm theirs.

00:32:45.320 --> 00:32:48.760
 And in the 18th century in the UK, they made laws.

00:32:48.760 --> 00:32:51.880
 Every town could make its own laws about what you would wear

00:32:51.880 --> 00:32:52.720
 when you were swimming.

00:32:52.720 --> 00:32:55.640
 So in the city of Bath,

00:32:55.640 --> 00:32:59.440
 they made it illegal for men to swim without a waistcoat.

00:32:59.440 --> 00:33:00.440
 No.

00:33:00.440 --> 00:33:07.240
 Is that with, would men have to have the sort of the top as well,

00:33:07.240 --> 00:33:09.360
 or is this bare chest with a waistcoat on?

00:33:09.360 --> 00:33:11.600
 I think the waistcoat just referred to anything

00:33:11.600 --> 00:33:13.080
 that would cover your chest, really.

00:33:13.080 --> 00:33:16.520
 It wasn't like a proper top hat and tails kind of thing.

00:33:16.520 --> 00:33:17.520
 Yeah.

00:33:17.520 --> 00:33:21.160
 Did you guys come across Donald Clark in your research?

00:33:21.160 --> 00:33:22.160
 Yeah.

00:33:22.160 --> 00:33:25.480
 He was an early, he was very much fighting the tide of history.

00:33:25.480 --> 00:33:27.640
 He was an opponent to mixed swimming.

00:33:27.640 --> 00:33:30.040
 He was a counsellor in Tonbridge,

00:33:30.040 --> 00:33:35.400
 and he said that by making girls look like wet Scotch terriers,

00:33:35.400 --> 00:33:38.920
 mixed bathing stops more marriages than any other cause

00:33:38.920 --> 00:33:40.280
 and much unrest in the country

00:33:40.280 --> 00:33:42.520
 due to the barbarous licence of women's dress.

00:33:42.520 --> 00:33:44.760
 So he was basically saying women look like such mingers

00:33:44.760 --> 00:33:47.080
 when they've been in the water that no one will want to marry them.

00:33:47.080 --> 00:33:50.920
 And he was then, so this is in a sort of furious letter

00:33:50.920 --> 00:33:52.200
 to the papers or something,

00:33:52.200 --> 00:33:54.360
 he was then given a job by the Daily Mail

00:33:54.360 --> 00:33:56.760
 to go around beaches looking for outrageous things

00:33:56.760 --> 00:33:57.880
 to be angry about.

00:33:57.880 --> 00:34:00.360
 Some things haven't changed.

00:34:00.360 --> 00:34:02.200
 That's amazing.

00:34:02.200 --> 00:34:03.960
 Wow.

00:34:03.960 --> 00:34:05.080
 That's so good,

00:34:05.080 --> 00:34:07.240
 because I think the Daily Mail does employ a lot of people

00:34:07.240 --> 00:34:08.680
 like that still today, doesn't it?

00:34:08.680 --> 00:34:10.520
 Literally just find something to get angry about.

00:34:10.520 --> 00:34:12.120
 We need to fill our vages.

00:34:12.120 --> 00:34:12.600
 Anything.

00:34:12.600 --> 00:34:18.040
 I was reading about a swimming hero called Gertrude Eddell,

00:34:18.040 --> 00:34:21.640
 so she was the first woman to swim the English Channel in 1925.

00:34:21.640 --> 00:34:26.440
 And she was trained by this guy called Jabez Wolff,

00:34:26.440 --> 00:34:27.800
 who was a bizarre character himself.

00:34:27.800 --> 00:34:29.880
 I don't know why she chose him to train her,

00:34:29.880 --> 00:34:33.880
 because he'd tried and failed to swim the Channel 22 times previously.

00:34:33.880 --> 00:34:38.360
 And despite, apparently, he employed a bagpiper for encouragement,

00:34:38.360 --> 00:34:39.160
 and that didn't help.

00:34:39.960 --> 00:34:42.200
 But anyway, she tried and...

00:34:42.200 --> 00:34:43.480
 If the bagpipers are behind you,

00:34:43.480 --> 00:34:45.000
 then that will encourage you to swim forward.

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:49.080
 You're trying to get as far away from Scotland as you can.

00:34:49.080 --> 00:34:53.720
 So her first attempt, he, Jabez,

00:34:53.720 --> 00:34:55.960
 her trainer pulled her out of the water halfway through,

00:34:55.960 --> 00:34:58.040
 saying that it looked like she was drowning.

00:34:58.040 --> 00:34:59.720
 And she said she wasn't drowning at all.

00:34:59.720 --> 00:35:02.120
 She'd just been having a rest face down in the water.

00:35:02.120 --> 00:35:04.040
 Eventually she did it.

00:35:04.040 --> 00:35:06.200
 She was the sixth person ever to swim the Channel,

00:35:06.200 --> 00:35:08.840
 and she was the fastest ever of men and women.

00:35:08.840 --> 00:35:10.440
 She did it in 14 and a half hours.

00:35:10.440 --> 00:35:13.240
 So she beat the previous person by two hours.

00:35:13.240 --> 00:35:15.160
 Did front crawl all the way.

00:35:15.160 --> 00:35:18.440
 And the first thing, she did it from France to England.

00:35:18.440 --> 00:35:21.080
 And the first person to meet her on the beach in Kent

00:35:21.080 --> 00:35:22.920
 when she arrived was an immigration officer

00:35:22.920 --> 00:35:24.440
 who demanded to see her passport.

00:35:24.440 --> 00:35:25.080
 Amazing.

00:35:25.080 --> 00:35:27.560
 He was actually working for the Daily Mail, wasn't he, at the time?

00:35:27.560 --> 00:35:31.720
 Do you know what she was fed on the way?

00:35:31.720 --> 00:35:33.080
 I find this so weird.

00:35:33.080 --> 00:35:35.880
 What she got fed, chicken legs.

00:35:35.880 --> 00:35:36.440
 I think...

00:35:36.440 --> 00:35:38.280
 Because if they touched you in the water,

00:35:38.280 --> 00:35:39.720
 then that sort of, you're out.

00:35:39.720 --> 00:35:41.560
 Because you've been kind of supported by him.

00:35:41.560 --> 00:35:43.640
 But her support boat was apparently full of chicken legs,

00:35:43.640 --> 00:35:46.040
 which, okay, throws someone a chicken leg in the water.

00:35:46.040 --> 00:35:49.720
 Oranges and chicken soup to sustain her as she went.

00:35:49.720 --> 00:35:53.560
 And I have no idea how she was fed the soup.

00:35:53.560 --> 00:35:55.560
 Right. What must happen, right, is,

00:35:55.560 --> 00:35:57.560
 I don't want to take anything away from her swim,

00:35:57.560 --> 00:36:00.600
 but they give her a straw to suck the soup.

00:36:00.600 --> 00:36:02.920
 And actually she's biting onto the straw

00:36:02.920 --> 00:36:04.280
 while it's attached to the boat,

00:36:04.280 --> 00:36:05.800
 and she's used it to pull her along.

00:36:06.680 --> 00:36:09.000
 So she's water skiing there basically.

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:10.040
 Basically doing that.

00:36:10.040 --> 00:36:13.160
 This is a great and niche conspiracy theory

00:36:13.160 --> 00:36:15.720
 that needs to see more at.

00:36:15.720 --> 00:36:19.240
 One person who tried to swim the channel before Gertrude

00:36:19.240 --> 00:36:21.800
 was an Australian called Annette Kellerman,

00:36:21.800 --> 00:36:24.520
 who was probably the most famous swimmer in the world.

00:36:24.520 --> 00:36:29.080
 She was the first woman to publicly wear a one-piece swimming costume.

00:36:29.080 --> 00:36:30.440
 She was arrested on the beach.

00:36:30.440 --> 00:36:31.880
 She was one of these people who was arrested

00:36:31.880 --> 00:36:36.360
 for public indecency for wearing like a two-sexier swimming costume.

00:36:36.840 --> 00:36:38.600
 But it wasn't really very effective,

00:36:38.600 --> 00:36:41.560
 and she ended up releasing her own line of bathing costumes

00:36:41.560 --> 00:36:44.360
 and became massively rich because people wanted to look like her

00:36:44.360 --> 00:36:45.800
 because she was so famous.

00:36:45.800 --> 00:36:48.840
 She was paid by the Melbourne exhibition hall to swim in,

00:36:48.840 --> 00:36:49.800
 and it's aquarium.

00:36:49.800 --> 00:36:52.600
 So people would come and watch her swim.

00:36:52.600 --> 00:36:54.600
 It was like you were saying about the Bordeville earlier,

00:36:54.600 --> 00:36:57.080
 and it was like you would just go to watch her swim.

00:36:57.080 --> 00:37:00.120
 She was like a swimming costume hero, wasn't she?

00:37:00.120 --> 00:37:03.880
 She was the person who brought us the swimming costume, Annette Kellerman.

00:37:03.880 --> 00:37:05.160
 We've been pitching about the Daily Mail,

00:37:05.160 --> 00:37:09.000
 so for some balance, here's some perspective on the Daily Mirror.

00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:11.160
 She came between Australia and America.

00:37:11.160 --> 00:37:13.320
 She came to the UK to do some swimming,

00:37:13.320 --> 00:37:16.920
 and she broke a record for swimming from Dober to Margate,

00:37:16.920 --> 00:37:19.320
 and she caused this huge stir, and it was all great.

00:37:19.320 --> 00:37:22.760
 And the Daily Mirror paid her to swim along that coast

00:37:22.760 --> 00:37:24.760
 every single day for two months.

00:37:24.760 --> 00:37:27.960
 And they said to her, she was like, every day for two months?

00:37:27.960 --> 00:37:30.280
 Oh, God. I mean, that sounds like hell.

00:37:30.280 --> 00:37:31.960
 And they said it's a huge thing for women.

00:37:31.960 --> 00:37:34.600
 It's going to go down as a great, successful, women kind.

00:37:34.600 --> 00:37:36.120
 And what they actually meant was,

00:37:36.120 --> 00:37:38.680
 there's a lady from Australia in a swimsuit,

00:37:38.680 --> 00:37:39.960
 which we've never seen before here,

00:37:39.960 --> 00:37:42.040
 and they obviously invited lots of crowds every day

00:37:42.040 --> 00:37:44.360
 to come and watch her in her swimsuit

00:37:44.360 --> 00:37:46.200
 and made loads of money selling their papers.

00:37:46.200 --> 00:37:48.840
 And it was sort of the first page three type things

00:37:48.840 --> 00:37:50.760
 were these pictures of Annette Kellerman

00:37:50.760 --> 00:37:52.520
 and people like her in swimsuits.

00:37:52.520 --> 00:37:54.600
 I've read about her show.

00:37:54.600 --> 00:37:56.200
 She was called The Diving Venus,

00:37:56.200 --> 00:37:59.720
 and the show ran on Broadway for four years.

00:38:00.440 --> 00:38:05.000
 And then she went to Hollywood and she starred

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:06.760
 in a film called Daughter of the Gods.

00:38:06.760 --> 00:38:09.320
 She did loads of films, but this was in 1916.

00:38:09.320 --> 00:38:12.520
 And the film used 20,000 extras.

00:38:12.520 --> 00:38:13.720
 It cost a million dollars to make,

00:38:13.720 --> 00:38:15.720
 which was pretty unusual at the time.

00:38:15.720 --> 00:38:19.000
 And there were scenes of her swimming nude in it,

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:21.080
 I think from quite a distance,

00:38:21.080 --> 00:38:23.480
 but this led to the formal banning of,

00:38:23.480 --> 00:38:25.560
 as they were called, nude scenes in films.

00:38:25.560 --> 00:38:29.080
 And so, yeah, it's thanks to her.

00:38:29.080 --> 00:38:31.640
 Yeah, she did all her own stunts in that movie,

00:38:31.640 --> 00:38:33.960
 including a 20-meter dive into the ocean

00:38:33.960 --> 00:38:36.120
 with her hands and feet tied together

00:38:36.120 --> 00:38:39.240
 and also being thrown into a pool with six crocodiles.

00:38:39.240 --> 00:38:43.000
 Wow, it really, it sounds like a promoter Bill Sargent.

00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:46.600
 He really would have made a lot of money out of that woman.

00:38:46.600 --> 00:38:49.160
 When she was on Broadway making all her money,

00:38:49.160 --> 00:38:53.080
 she made $1,250 a week on Broadway.

00:38:53.080 --> 00:38:55.320
 And when she was doing it, there was a Harvard professor

00:38:55.320 --> 00:38:57.160
 who said she was a perfect woman

00:38:57.160 --> 00:39:00.040
 after comparing her measurements to the Venus de Milo.

00:39:00.040 --> 00:39:02.440
 Now, the Venus de Milo doesn't have any arms.

00:39:02.440 --> 00:39:03.320
 No.

00:39:03.320 --> 00:39:07.560
 Useful in swimming, particularly.

00:39:07.560 --> 00:39:13.240
 OK, it's time for our final fact of the show,

00:39:13.240 --> 00:39:15.080
 and that is Andy.

00:39:15.080 --> 00:39:17.240
 My fact is that the film of Dr. Dolittle

00:39:17.240 --> 00:39:20.040
 was delayed for days after the giraffe being used

00:39:20.040 --> 00:39:22.120
 accidentally stepped on its own penis.

00:39:22.120 --> 00:39:25.240
 So...

00:39:26.280 --> 00:39:27.800
 How long is a giraffe's penis?

00:39:27.800 --> 00:39:28.680
 Is it, like, a fifth leg?

00:39:28.680 --> 00:39:31.320
 Well, is it that before or after you've trodden on it?

00:39:31.320 --> 00:39:32.440
 That's the question.

00:39:32.440 --> 00:39:33.960
 They have really long legs.

00:39:33.960 --> 00:39:37.640
 I just can't work out the mechanics of this, Andy, at all.

00:39:37.640 --> 00:39:38.200
 It doesn't...

00:39:38.200 --> 00:39:41.480
 Well, they, I mean, they're like folding deck chairs.

00:39:41.480 --> 00:39:43.000
 You know, it's very easy to get something

00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:44.200
 caught in a folding deck chair,

00:39:44.200 --> 00:39:45.800
 and I think that's the same principle.

00:39:45.800 --> 00:39:48.520
 You need to stop going on those nudist holidays, Andy.

00:39:48.520 --> 00:39:50.680
 I can't take many more of those injuries.

00:39:50.680 --> 00:39:51.400
 I'll tell you that much.

00:39:51.400 --> 00:39:54.680
 So, to be completely clear,

00:39:54.680 --> 00:39:57.720
 this is the 1967 "Dr. Dolittle" with Rex Harrison,

00:39:57.720 --> 00:39:59.640
 not the 2021 with Robert Downey Jr.,

00:39:59.640 --> 00:40:01.240
 where pretty much all the animals are CGI,

00:40:01.240 --> 00:40:03.160
 and nobody stepped on anybody's penises.

00:40:03.160 --> 00:40:05.880
 And this comes from a great book called

00:40:05.880 --> 00:40:08.200
 "Scenes from a Revolution, the Birth of the New Hollywood,"

00:40:08.200 --> 00:40:11.640
 which is kind of an in-depth look at five films in particular.

00:40:11.640 --> 00:40:15.560
 It's by Mark Harris, and one of those films is "Dr. Dolittle,"

00:40:15.560 --> 00:40:18.360
 and there was a guy working on it called Herbert Ross,

00:40:18.360 --> 00:40:20.120
 who was the choreographer,

00:40:20.120 --> 00:40:21.480
 and he wrote to a colleague saying,

00:40:21.480 --> 00:40:25.320
 "We're postponed for three days, the giraffe stepped on his cock."

00:40:25.320 --> 00:40:29.880
 And so, it stepped on his cock, though?

00:40:29.880 --> 00:40:31.160
 Are we misreading that?

00:40:31.160 --> 00:40:33.720
 Yeah, stepped on Rex Harrison.

00:40:33.720 --> 00:40:37.720
 Yeah, so that's that.

00:40:37.720 --> 00:40:40.120
 It was pretty chaotic, wasn't it, that film?

00:40:40.120 --> 00:40:40.840
 Sounds amazing.

00:40:40.840 --> 00:40:44.200
 Apparently, it was revealed after it was one giraffe died,

00:40:44.200 --> 00:40:46.440
 and I don't think we know how, still,

00:40:46.440 --> 00:40:48.520
 but one of the people who worked on it said one giraffe died.

00:40:48.520 --> 00:40:51.320
 But, I mean, the general management of animals

00:40:51.320 --> 00:40:52.280
 sounds like hell.

00:40:52.280 --> 00:40:53.880
 It had lots of different filming locations,

00:40:53.880 --> 00:40:57.480
 so it was partly filmed in LA and then in the Caribbean and in the UK.

00:40:57.480 --> 00:40:59.160
 And because of quarantine laws,

00:40:59.160 --> 00:41:01.880
 they had to hire separate sets of identical animals

00:41:01.880 --> 00:41:04.440
 for each place to play the same characters.

00:41:04.440 --> 00:41:07.400
 And then also, the animals grow so fast

00:41:07.400 --> 00:41:09.720
 that they had to keep finding replacements, like doppelgangers.

00:41:09.720 --> 00:41:13.080
 So, I think there was a pig called "Gubgub" in the film,

00:41:13.080 --> 00:41:16.360
 which had 40 different piglets play at various times.

00:41:16.360 --> 00:41:19.080
 I mean, it does seem questionable, doesn't it?

00:41:19.080 --> 00:41:21.880
 A lot of the sort of stuff they did to the animals,

00:41:21.880 --> 00:41:24.120
 there was a squirrel that they had to sedate

00:41:24.120 --> 00:41:25.720
 during a scene that they needed him for.

00:41:25.720 --> 00:41:28.840
 By the sedation method they used was a fountain pen

00:41:28.840 --> 00:41:32.200
 where they dripped a gin through it to just get it drunk.

00:41:32.200 --> 00:41:33.720
 But it ended up losing consciousness,

00:41:33.720 --> 00:41:36.040
 because it was so drunk that they couldn't properly get the scene done.

00:41:36.040 --> 00:41:37.960
 That doesn't seem very ethical in terms of...

00:41:37.960 --> 00:41:39.080
 I think that's absolutely fine.

00:41:39.080 --> 00:41:41.240
 Elizabeth Taylor used to request that kind of thing

00:41:41.240 --> 00:41:42.760
 before she'd go over it at the camera.

00:41:42.760 --> 00:41:47.560
 There's a great story where in one scene

00:41:47.560 --> 00:41:49.880
 that Rex Harrison was doing, he kept...

00:41:49.880 --> 00:41:52.120
 This is the story that he kept stopping the scene

00:41:52.120 --> 00:41:53.640
 and the director's going, "What are you doing?"

00:41:53.640 --> 00:41:55.800
 And he goes, "Well, you keep calling cut."

00:41:55.800 --> 00:41:58.760
 He's going, "I'm not calling cut, you're definitely calling cut."

00:41:58.760 --> 00:42:01.480
 And they worked out that it was the parrot that was in the scene

00:42:01.480 --> 00:42:03.160
 that's going to mimic the word "cut."

00:42:03.160 --> 00:42:04.040
 No way.

00:42:04.040 --> 00:42:07.000
 Yeah, and Rex was getting confused.

00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:09.960
 So, they built a set for the house of Dr. Doolittle.

00:42:09.960 --> 00:42:12.600
 Whose whole stake is that he can talk to the animals.

00:42:12.600 --> 00:42:13.800
 So, he lives with a load of animals.

00:42:13.800 --> 00:42:18.440
 But the whole house, the set had to be built on a slant

00:42:18.440 --> 00:42:20.840
 because obviously the animals are pooing everywhere

00:42:20.840 --> 00:42:22.040
 and peeing everywhere.

00:42:22.040 --> 00:42:24.280
 So, they had lots of people in the crew

00:42:24.280 --> 00:42:27.720
 just standing around with brooms waiting for when that happened.

00:42:27.720 --> 00:42:30.200
 All the furniture had to be either plastic or painted

00:42:30.200 --> 00:42:33.000
 so that it could be hosed down at the end of each day

00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:34.840
 filming in this set house.

00:42:34.840 --> 00:42:36.360
 They had to have double the sets

00:42:36.360 --> 00:42:38.600
 because frequently animals would just kick a hole

00:42:38.600 --> 00:42:40.440
 in the walls or the furniture.

00:42:41.400 --> 00:42:43.640
 The trainers got hepatitis from being bitten.

00:42:43.640 --> 00:42:47.800
 I read one amazing sentence in the link you sent, Andy,

00:42:47.800 --> 00:42:50.760
 which is, "Unfathomably, the ducks in the pond

00:42:50.760 --> 00:42:53.880
 "appeared to forget how to swim and started to sink."

00:42:53.880 --> 00:42:57.480
 You know you're having a bad time.

00:42:57.480 --> 00:42:59.400
 You think you'd be able to rely on the ducks

00:42:59.400 --> 00:43:00.600
 to be able to swim.

00:43:00.600 --> 00:43:01.560
 So funny.

00:43:01.560 --> 00:43:03.720
 But apparently what had happened was

00:43:03.720 --> 00:43:05.160
 it was the wrong time of year,

00:43:05.160 --> 00:43:08.280
 so they'd lost all their waterproof sheen on their feathers.

00:43:08.280 --> 00:43:09.240
 And at that time of year,

00:43:09.240 --> 00:43:11.160
 ducks don't normally swim or something.

00:43:11.160 --> 00:43:12.760
 And so they all just started sinking.

00:43:12.760 --> 00:43:13.880
 Yeah, I found that amazing.

00:43:13.880 --> 00:43:15.240
 I didn't know that.

00:43:15.240 --> 00:43:16.360
 Didn't know that ever happened.

00:43:16.360 --> 00:43:17.400
 Incredible.

00:43:17.400 --> 00:43:18.920
 Has anyone seen the movie?

00:43:18.920 --> 00:43:20.120
 Years ago as a kid, yeah.

00:43:20.120 --> 00:43:21.080
 Really? Was that any good?

00:43:21.080 --> 00:43:23.560
 Yeah, I mean as a kid it was one of those

00:43:23.560 --> 00:43:24.680
 Sunday afternoon movies.

00:43:24.680 --> 00:43:26.280
 And I do remember loving it,

00:43:26.280 --> 00:43:28.040
 but I've read a lot of things

00:43:28.040 --> 00:43:29.800
 that suggest that I'm completely wrong about that.

00:43:29.800 --> 00:43:31.880
 It has a very low rating.

00:43:31.880 --> 00:43:34.120
 It got the best-pitched Oscar nomination,

00:43:34.120 --> 00:43:37.160
 but it's the lowest-rated score on Rotten Tomatoes

00:43:37.160 --> 00:43:38.760
 ever to get a nomination.

00:43:39.400 --> 00:43:41.400
 Ooh, what's it rocking on Rotten?

00:43:41.400 --> 00:43:42.200
 32%.

00:43:42.200 --> 00:43:45.800
 Rex Harrison, who was the star of it,

00:43:45.800 --> 00:43:47.720
 was so horrible to everyone

00:43:47.720 --> 00:43:49.720
 that he was nicknamed Tyrannosaurus Rex,

00:43:49.720 --> 00:43:51.400
 which is very clever when you think

00:43:51.400 --> 00:43:53.480
 because it's a film about animals that are talking.

00:43:53.480 --> 00:43:54.200
 Yes.

00:43:54.200 --> 00:43:56.680
 He had a good reputation for behaving like that

00:43:56.680 --> 00:43:58.440
 quite frequently, didn't he, Rex Harrison?

00:43:58.440 --> 00:43:59.880
 He was grumpy bastard.

00:43:59.880 --> 00:44:00.920
 Or a character,

00:44:00.920 --> 00:44:02.760
 depending on which way you want to frame it.

00:44:02.760 --> 00:44:04.280
 But I should say,

00:44:04.280 --> 00:44:05.800
 so I'm a huge My Fair Lady fan

00:44:05.800 --> 00:44:07.960
 and a big Rex Harrison fan in that.

00:44:07.960 --> 00:44:09.880
 And there's a guy called Will Harrison,

00:44:09.880 --> 00:44:12.920
 who's his grandson, who listens to the podcast.

00:44:12.920 --> 00:44:15.720
 So we have inside Rex Harrison info,

00:44:15.720 --> 00:44:16.600
 apparently on,

00:44:16.600 --> 00:44:18.840
 if you look at the film poster of Cleopatra,

00:44:18.840 --> 00:44:20.680
 who was supposed to just have Richard Burton

00:44:20.680 --> 00:44:22.920
 and Elizabeth Taylor on it as Anthony and Cleopatra.

00:44:22.920 --> 00:44:23.480
 OK.

00:44:23.480 --> 00:44:25.720
 But Rex was like, I'm the big star here, guys.

00:44:25.720 --> 00:44:26.520
 What the hell are you doing?

00:44:26.520 --> 00:44:27.480
 Get me on the poster.

00:44:27.480 --> 00:44:29.240
 And so you see just behind them,

00:44:29.240 --> 00:44:31.800
 Juliet Caesar, Rex Harrison staring

00:44:31.800 --> 00:44:33.960
 really creepily down at this loving couple.

00:44:33.960 --> 00:44:35.960
 And he was always doing stuff like that.

00:44:35.960 --> 00:44:37.800
 There's one particularly famous anecdote

00:44:37.800 --> 00:44:40.280
 which is that he'd performed in the theater

00:44:40.280 --> 00:44:43.400
 and there was an autograph hunter waiting outside.

00:44:43.400 --> 00:44:45.320
 She had her book ready for him to sign.

00:44:45.320 --> 00:44:47.160
 He came out, she asked for the autograph

00:44:47.160 --> 00:44:49.240
 and he said, "Sod off."

00:44:49.240 --> 00:44:50.360
 And what she did was,

00:44:50.360 --> 00:44:51.480
 she rolled up the program,

00:44:51.480 --> 00:44:54.440
 she wanted him to sign and she hit him with it.

00:44:54.440 --> 00:44:56.920
 And the co-star of the play, Stanley Holloway,

00:44:56.920 --> 00:45:00.840
 later said that it was a rare but welcome case

00:45:00.840 --> 00:45:02.360
 of the fan hitting the shit.

00:45:02.360 --> 00:45:06.200
 That's how they viewed him.

00:45:06.200 --> 00:45:08.840
 You know Christopher Plummer, the actor?

00:45:08.840 --> 00:45:09.240
 Yes.

00:45:09.240 --> 00:45:11.240
 He has a sound of music and stuff, I guess.

00:45:11.240 --> 00:45:14.840
 He was paid $300,000 not to be in "Doctor Do Little."

00:45:14.840 --> 00:45:15.720
 Really?

00:45:15.720 --> 00:45:20.280
 Which is such an epic fail by the accountants, I think.

00:45:20.280 --> 00:45:22.920
 So basically, Harrison temporarily quit the project.

00:45:22.920 --> 00:45:25.080
 He decided he wasn't completely up for it.

00:45:25.080 --> 00:45:26.440
 And then so they said,

00:45:26.440 --> 00:45:28.360
 "Well, who do we get? We need some Hollywood giant."

00:45:28.360 --> 00:45:29.480
 So they got Christopher Plummer,

00:45:29.480 --> 00:45:32.440
 signed him up for $300,000.

00:45:32.440 --> 00:45:33.640
 And then Harrison said,

00:45:33.640 --> 00:45:35.240
 "Oh, fine, I will do the film then."

00:45:35.240 --> 00:45:36.840
 So Plummer never filmed a scene,

00:45:36.840 --> 00:45:38.120
 never said a line of the dialogue,

00:45:38.120 --> 00:45:40.280
 but still got paid his full fee for it.

00:45:40.280 --> 00:45:41.400
 It's the dream job.

00:45:41.400 --> 00:45:42.520
 It's the dream job.

00:45:42.520 --> 00:45:45.720
 It was originally written by a woman called Helen Winston.

00:45:45.720 --> 00:45:47.880
 And they rewrote it.

00:45:47.880 --> 00:45:49.480
 They just completely rewrote the thing.

00:45:49.480 --> 00:45:52.520
 Apart from, they used loads of her stuff,

00:45:52.520 --> 00:45:54.440
 but then didn't tell her she was going to use it.

00:45:54.440 --> 00:45:56.200
 And so she sued them and she got

00:45:56.200 --> 00:45:58.920
 £3.2 million out of them for that.

00:45:58.920 --> 00:45:59.320
 Whoa!

00:45:59.320 --> 00:46:03.480
 And it lost £9 million in the box office.

00:46:03.480 --> 00:46:07.240
 So a third of that was just due to stealing this woman's work.

00:46:07.240 --> 00:46:09.480
 So actually, the two people in it

00:46:09.480 --> 00:46:11.480
 who had their work stolen from them,

00:46:11.480 --> 00:46:13.800
 Christopher Plummer and this lady,

00:46:13.800 --> 00:46:15.160
 sounds like they were the real winners here.

00:46:15.160 --> 00:46:19.960
 So Dr. Dolittle is incredibly loosely based

00:46:19.960 --> 00:46:22.280
 on a series of stories written by Hugh Lofting

00:46:22.280 --> 00:46:26.120
 in the 1920s and during the First World War.

00:46:26.120 --> 00:46:27.480
 And they bear no resemblance.

00:46:27.480 --> 00:46:28.120
 I don't think the plots,

00:46:28.120 --> 00:46:30.120
 but any resemblance to the stories he originally wrote,

00:46:30.120 --> 00:46:32.680
 but they are about a doctor who talks to animals.

00:46:32.680 --> 00:46:34.760
 And it's quite a sweet story.

00:46:34.760 --> 00:46:36.360
 So I hadn't realised he wrote them

00:46:36.360 --> 00:46:38.920
 while he was fighting in the trenches in World War I,

00:46:38.920 --> 00:46:41.400
 and he was writing letters back to his children.

00:46:41.400 --> 00:46:43.080
 And he understandably thought,

00:46:43.080 --> 00:46:44.280
 "I'm not sure I want to tell the kids

00:46:44.280 --> 00:46:46.680
 about my trenches-based experience."

00:46:46.680 --> 00:46:49.160
 And so instead, he wrote these brilliant stories

00:46:49.160 --> 00:46:50.440
 about a guy who talks to animals.

00:46:50.440 --> 00:46:53.640
 He was a real crusader for animal rights in lots of ways.

00:46:53.640 --> 00:46:55.400
 And he once beat up three men,

00:46:55.400 --> 00:46:56.600
 including one who had a knife,

00:46:56.600 --> 00:46:58.600
 because they were trying to tame some wild horses.

00:46:58.600 --> 00:47:00.680
 And they were, I think,

00:47:00.680 --> 00:47:02.680
 not being especially pleasant to the horses.

00:47:02.680 --> 00:47:03.720
 So, yeah.

00:47:03.720 --> 00:47:07.480
 Yeah, he was very strong on sympathising with animals.

00:47:07.480 --> 00:47:09.800
 He was shocked by how horses were treated.

00:47:09.800 --> 00:47:12.760
 They did have a very bad time in the First World War.

00:47:12.760 --> 00:47:15.560
 Yeah, it was the way that he saw horses being treated.

00:47:15.560 --> 00:47:18.280
 And they needed to be looked after by vets.

00:47:18.280 --> 00:47:18.920
 But he was like,

00:47:18.920 --> 00:47:21.400
 "Well, they can't really tell us what's wrong with them

00:47:21.400 --> 00:47:22.440
 because they're horses."

00:47:22.440 --> 00:47:24.120
 And that was kind of what gave him the idea

00:47:24.120 --> 00:47:25.320
 of writing "Doctor Do Little."

00:47:25.320 --> 00:47:28.920
 But we should say that if you have read "Doctor Do Little"

00:47:28.920 --> 00:47:31.000
 in the last 20 or 30 years,

00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:34.360
 you're probably reading a massively sanitised version of it,

00:47:34.360 --> 00:47:37.720
 because the original is extremely racist.

00:47:37.720 --> 00:47:42.360
 So, in 1968, there was a librarian called Isabelle Sewell,

00:47:42.360 --> 00:47:45.560
 who wrote an essay about a few different books,

00:47:45.560 --> 00:47:47.800
 but specifically about "Doctor Do Little,"

00:47:47.800 --> 00:47:51.080
 who described you lofting as a white, racist, and chauvinist,

00:47:51.080 --> 00:47:55.080
 guilty of almost every prejudice known to modern white, western man.

00:47:55.080 --> 00:47:56.840
 And that was in the '60s.

00:47:56.840 --> 00:47:58.600
 So, yeah, exactly.

00:47:58.600 --> 00:48:00.760
 And so, basically, from then on,

00:48:00.760 --> 00:48:02.520
 he just got pretty much cancelled,

00:48:02.520 --> 00:48:06.040
 and really all his books went out-print for quite a long time

00:48:06.040 --> 00:48:11.080
 until they got rewritten with a lot of the racist bits taken out.

00:48:11.080 --> 00:48:13.480
 Yeah, with no resemblance to the originals, basically.

00:48:13.480 --> 00:48:16.200
 But on the other hand, loved horses.

00:48:16.200 --> 00:48:18.920
 Yeah, I mean, anti-war and pro-animal, for sure.

00:48:18.920 --> 00:48:20.520
 Yeah, yeah.

00:48:20.520 --> 00:48:24.600
 So, I've been looking a bit into talking to animals,

00:48:25.240 --> 00:48:28.600
 and people are doing serious work on this right now,

00:48:28.600 --> 00:48:29.720
 and it's really cool.

00:48:29.720 --> 00:48:31.640
 So, there is a new device,

00:48:31.640 --> 00:48:35.000
 which is trying to train basically Lassie technology.

00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:38.920
 So, the idea is that dogs will have a vest,

00:48:38.920 --> 00:48:40.120
 and if the person needs help,

00:48:40.120 --> 00:48:42.440
 they can pull a tab to communicate a message, okay?

00:48:42.440 --> 00:48:46.680
 So, it might be someone's fallen down a well,

00:48:46.680 --> 00:48:47.880
 but that's probably not going to be it,

00:48:47.880 --> 00:48:50.440
 because it's only one message on the tab that they can pull.

00:48:51.640 --> 00:48:55.400
 So, for example, lots of children with autism

00:48:55.400 --> 00:48:58.120
 find it very helpful and calming to have a dog,

00:48:58.120 --> 00:49:02.120
 and if they are panicking or upset,

00:49:02.120 --> 00:49:03.800
 it might be possible to train the dog

00:49:03.800 --> 00:49:06.440
 to pull the tab on its little vest,

00:49:06.440 --> 00:49:08.600
 because it can spot the size that its owner is upset,

00:49:08.600 --> 00:49:11.240
 and then that will read out the dog saying,

00:49:11.240 --> 00:49:12.520
 "Could you please pet me now?"

00:49:12.520 --> 00:49:15.640
 And then therefore, the child will pet the dog,

00:49:15.640 --> 00:49:17.320
 and we'll calm down and that will help.

00:49:17.320 --> 00:49:19.720
 So, they're trying to see if they can train dogs

00:49:19.720 --> 00:49:21.160
 to have several different messages,

00:49:21.160 --> 00:49:22.680
 or if they can train it.

00:49:22.680 --> 00:49:23.880
 So, either could you pet me now,

00:49:23.880 --> 00:49:26.600
 or someone's fallen down a well, or whatever it might be.

00:49:26.600 --> 00:49:29.560
 It's just those two they've coded in on the internet.

00:49:29.560 --> 00:49:34.520
 Wait, so the dog senses that the child is anxious,

00:49:34.520 --> 00:49:36.920
 and so then pulls the tab that says, "Can you pet me?"

00:49:36.920 --> 00:49:39.320
 So, the child signals they're anxious without realizing it,

00:49:39.320 --> 00:49:41.880
 and then the dog does something to make the child calm down.

00:49:41.880 --> 00:49:43.000
 Yeah, exactly, yeah, yeah.

00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:44.360
 Yeah, well, you might be anxious,

00:49:44.360 --> 00:49:46.520
 because the dog's just told you that someone's fallen down a well.

00:49:48.680 --> 00:49:50.520
 I really wish I hadn't mentioned this well thing.

00:49:50.520 --> 00:49:52.440
 Complete red herring.

00:49:52.440 --> 00:49:53.640
 Do you know that...

00:49:53.640 --> 00:49:55.960
 I was going to do this as a fact in a future week,

00:49:55.960 --> 00:49:58.440
 but do you know that the traditional way of preparing melon

00:49:58.440 --> 00:50:00.600
 in France was to put it down a well for four hours?

00:50:00.600 --> 00:50:02.120
 Melon?

00:50:02.120 --> 00:50:02.840
 A melon, yeah.

00:50:02.840 --> 00:50:03.960
 Because before...

00:50:03.960 --> 00:50:06.360
 What, and it came up perfectly sliced, I'm sure.

00:50:06.360 --> 00:50:08.760
 Who lived down that well?

00:50:08.760 --> 00:50:12.280
 A small child who fell there many years ago.

00:50:12.280 --> 00:50:13.800
 No, they are...

00:50:13.800 --> 00:50:17.080
 Basically, you wanted your melon to be nice and cold, right?

00:50:17.080 --> 00:50:19.800
 And they had no refrigeration, but they did have a well,

00:50:19.800 --> 00:50:21.080
 which was cold at the bottom.

00:50:21.080 --> 00:50:23.000
 So, they used to traditionally, in France,

00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:25.960
 they would put their melon in the well a few hours before,

00:50:25.960 --> 00:50:28.680
 and then bring it up, and it's nice and cold.

00:50:28.680 --> 00:50:30.680
 So, the dog would, in this case, have a third tab,

00:50:30.680 --> 00:50:32.520
 which says, "Your melon is ready, sir."

00:50:32.520 --> 00:50:38.360
 That was in an article written by B Wilson that I read the other day,

00:50:38.360 --> 00:50:39.640
 which is pretty amazing.

00:50:39.640 --> 00:50:43.480
 Artificial intelligence might help us to talk to animals,

00:50:43.480 --> 00:50:44.920
 or to understand what they're thinking.

00:50:45.720 --> 00:50:48.760
 There is a scientist called Dr. Krista McLennan,

00:50:48.760 --> 00:50:53.080
 who is working on a way of using AI to tell you what sheep are thinking.

00:50:53.080 --> 00:50:57.800
 And apparently, it's really hard for farmers to tell what a sheep is thinking,

00:50:57.800 --> 00:50:59.160
 just by looking at its face.

00:50:59.160 --> 00:51:02.600
 Because they don't have much expression on their faces.

00:51:02.600 --> 00:51:05.240
 You often see farmers kneeling down,

00:51:05.240 --> 00:51:07.560
 just staring deep into a sheep's eyes, don't you?

00:51:07.560 --> 00:51:09.480
 Going, "Why can't I tell?"

00:51:09.480 --> 00:51:11.480
 I mean, I believe this.

00:51:11.480 --> 00:51:14.360
 So, I was reading this article about this AI algorithm

00:51:14.360 --> 00:51:17.080
 that tells you whether a sheep's happy or not happy.

00:51:17.080 --> 00:51:18.040
 And there's part of it.

00:51:18.040 --> 00:51:23.160
 On NBC, they had a quiz where they would show you pictures of sheep,

00:51:23.160 --> 00:51:25.560
 and you had to guess whether they were happy or sad.

00:51:25.560 --> 00:51:30.280
 I only got one out of four, and that was a lucky guess,

00:51:30.280 --> 00:51:32.520
 because I just had three sad sheep in a row,

00:51:32.520 --> 00:51:34.360
 and I thought the fourth one must be a happy.

00:51:34.360 --> 00:51:35.240
 That's games for a show.

00:51:35.240 --> 00:51:36.360
 I did that same quiz.

00:51:36.360 --> 00:51:38.280
 I got three.

00:51:38.280 --> 00:51:40.760
 So, I'm a sheep whisperer, basically.

00:51:42.840 --> 00:51:44.680
 I didn't. It's quite specific, isn't it, though?

00:51:44.680 --> 00:51:45.960
 It is tricky.

00:51:45.960 --> 00:51:50.040
 So, the signs of pain or emotional suffering in a sheep are

00:51:50.040 --> 00:51:51.640
 narrow eyes, tight cheeks.

00:51:51.640 --> 00:51:54.200
 Oh, hold on. I don't know if I really want to do the test.

00:51:54.200 --> 00:51:54.760
 Yeah.

00:51:54.760 --> 00:51:55.320
 Okay.

00:51:55.320 --> 00:51:56.840
 Don't tell us your facts.

00:51:56.840 --> 00:51:59.080
 Anna, tell me the symptoms before you do the test,

00:51:59.080 --> 00:52:00.280
 is what the test is based on.

00:52:00.280 --> 00:52:00.920
 That's the thing.

00:52:00.920 --> 00:52:05.000
 They say if it has a nostril shape like a V rather than a U,

00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:06.680
 then it's either happy or sad.

00:52:06.680 --> 00:52:08.280
 Even though it told me that, I couldn't do it.

00:52:08.280 --> 00:52:10.600
 Although, I think handy, because there were only four,

00:52:10.600 --> 00:52:14.200
 and it was a 50/50 choice each time, then one out of four

00:52:14.200 --> 00:52:16.760
 and three out of four is within the standard deviation

00:52:16.760 --> 00:52:18.280
 of what you would expect.

00:52:18.280 --> 00:52:20.280
 Okay. All I'm hearing is that I won.

00:52:20.280 --> 00:52:25.320
 I'm going to be the sheep farmer.

00:52:25.320 --> 00:52:34.040
 Okay. That's it. That is all of our facts.

00:52:34.040 --> 00:52:35.560
