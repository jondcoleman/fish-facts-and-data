00:00:00,00:00:02,(upbeat music)
00:00:02,00:00:17,- Hello and welcome to another episode
00:00:17,00:00:18,"of No Such Thing as a Fish,"
00:00:18,00:00:20,a weekly podcast coming to you
00:00:20,00:00:23,from four undisclosed locations in the UK.
00:00:23,00:00:24,My name is Dan Schreiber.
00:00:24,00:00:27,"I am sitting here with James Harkin, Anna Tijinski"
00:00:27,00:00:28,and Andrew Hunter Murray.
00:00:28,00:00:31,"And once again, we have gathered around the microphones"
00:00:31,00:00:34,with our four favorite facts from the last seven days
00:00:34,00:00:37,"and in no particular order, here we go."
00:00:37,00:00:39,"Starting with you, James."
00:00:39,00:00:42,"- Okay, my fact this week is that in 1948,"
00:00:42,00:00:47,a drive-through fly-through cinema opened in New Jersey
00:00:47,00:00:49,where you could watch movies from the seat of your car
00:00:49,00:00:52,or the seat of your small aircraft.
00:00:52,00:00:54,- That's great.
00:00:54,00:00:56,"- Okay, so a couple of things to say"
00:00:56,00:00:57,before we get into this.
00:00:57,00:00:59,Number one is that most of the following material
00:00:59,00:01:01,that you're about to hear from me
00:01:01,00:01:02,comes from an amazing book
00:01:02,00:01:05,called The History of Driving Theatres by Kerry Seagrave.
00:01:05,00:01:08,"And secondly, this fact would have made a lot more sense"
00:01:08,00:01:10,"if it had been in its original setting,"
00:01:10,00:01:11,which was in a drive-in show
00:01:11,00:01:13,that we were supposed to do this week.
00:01:13,00:01:16,"- Yes, yeah, this episode was meant to be"
00:01:16,00:01:18,in one very disclosed location
00:01:18,00:01:22,and unfortunately got canceled.
00:01:22,00:01:23,"- Sorry about that, everyone."
00:01:23,00:01:25,"- Yeah, much apologies. - Not our fault."
00:01:25,00:01:27,"- Not our fault, but you're going to get the facts anyway."
00:01:27,00:01:28,- I think we can pretend.
00:01:28,00:01:29,"Guys, we can pretend."
00:01:29,00:01:31,We can just all pretend we're in a car.
00:01:31,00:01:32,The people at home won't know.
00:01:32,00:01:35,"- Andy, we weren't supposed to be in a car"
00:01:35,00:01:36,when we were doing the show.
00:01:36,00:01:38,It was the audience that were in a car.
00:01:38,00:01:39,We were supposed to be on the stage.
00:01:39,00:01:42,- I was going to bring my car to the stage
00:01:42,00:01:43,and then just sit in there.
00:01:43,00:01:47,"So this fly-through,"
00:01:47,00:01:50,did you have planes and cars next to each other?
00:01:50,00:01:52,- The planes were behind the cars.
00:01:52,00:01:53,"- That makes sense,"
00:01:53,00:01:55,"because if the planes were in front of the cars,"
00:01:55,00:01:58,"then it's a raw deal if you're sitting in your car, isn't it?"
00:01:58,00:01:59,Just looking at the arse of a plane.
00:01:59,00:02:01,"- If it's a 747 or something like that,"
00:02:01,00:02:03,you don't want to climb in front of you.
00:02:03,00:02:06,"But this was organized by a guy called Edward Brown Jr.,"
00:02:06,00:02:08,"who was a former Navy pilot,"
00:02:08,00:02:12,and his drive-in had capacity for 500 cars
00:02:12,00:02:15,and then 25 aeroplanes on the last couple of rows.
00:02:15,00:02:16,And what would happen is you would fly
00:02:16,00:02:20,"into a nearby airfield and then you would taxi into the,"
00:02:20,00:02:24,"not get a taxi, you would drive the plane on its wheels"
00:02:24,00:02:25,"into the last row of the theater,"
00:02:25,00:02:28,and then afterwards a jeep would tow you back
00:02:28,00:02:30,to the airfield and you'd be able to fly off again.
00:02:30,00:02:33,And the charge for the aeroplanes was 25 cents.
00:02:33,00:02:36,- Wow. - That's extraordinary.
00:02:36,00:02:38,I guess this was a bit more in the time
00:02:38,00:02:41,when your average Joe sometimes had a plane.
00:02:41,00:02:46,"People sort of did a bit more in the '40s, didn't they?"
00:02:46,00:02:49,They did like a small piece together aeroplanes.
00:02:49,00:02:50,"I think it was much, much more common."
00:02:50,00:02:51,"Like people used to,"
00:02:51,00:02:54,you used to have hobbyists who would do sort of trick flights
00:02:54,00:02:57,"in and out of sheds and stuff, but still very weird."
00:02:57,00:03:00,"Although I read that it sort of caught on,"
00:03:00,00:03:02,so it must have had a few people going
00:03:02,00:03:05,"because a few more popped up in the subsequent years, right,"
00:03:05,00:03:06,in like Alabama and Texas.
00:03:06,00:03:09,"- Yeah, some of them opened by the same guy."
00:03:09,00:03:12,So I don't know if that's a huge mark of success.
00:03:12,00:03:15,- You don't open up a second drive-through fly-through
00:03:15,00:03:17,unless your first one was successful.
00:03:17,00:03:18,"- Yeah, absolutely, yeah."
00:03:18,00:03:19,- That's true.
00:03:19,00:03:22,"But he really, it was quite exciting what he did"
00:03:22,00:03:25,"because he bought this land and he turned the whole,"
00:03:25,00:03:28,"so he set up the airport, he set up the drive-through."
00:03:28,00:03:32,He bulldozed everything in the way using a World War I tank
00:03:32,00:03:35,and it also had a sort of gulf range next to it
00:03:35,00:03:37,and an amusement park and playground.
00:03:37,00:03:38,- There was a great article
00:03:38,00:03:41,by someone called Mary Morley Cohen on this.
00:03:41,00:03:42,And I'm just gonna list the extra things
00:03:42,00:03:44,"that one particular drive-in had, okay?"
00:03:44,00:03:48,"It had a playground, pony rides, a dance floor,"
00:03:48,00:03:50,"shuffleboard and horseshoe pitching tournaments,"
00:03:50,00:03:53,"cartoon carnivals, midnight spook shows,"
00:03:53,00:03:56,"baby parades and beautiful child contests,"
00:03:56,00:03:57,"daredevil car rides, circus acts,"
00:03:57,00:04:00,"high tower dives, anniversary and birthday celebrations,"
00:04:00,00:04:02,"fireworks, a picnic and play area,"
00:04:02,00:04:05,potato sack races and television.
00:04:05,00:04:10,"- That's just extra TV in case you're bored of the film,"
00:04:10,00:04:10,I guess.
00:04:10,00:04:12,- That's amazing.
00:04:12,00:04:15,There was one in Memphis where you could get your laundry done
00:04:15,00:04:17,when you went to the drive-in.
00:04:17,00:04:19,"So you turn up with your laundry, hand it in"
00:04:19,00:04:21,and then they clean it for you.
00:04:21,00:04:22,"And as you left, you'd pick it up."
00:04:22,00:04:24,- That's so good.
00:04:24,00:04:26,- It's almost like the films just weren't the main attraction.
00:04:26,00:04:28,And I think someone did an experiment
00:04:28,00:04:30,"'cause they thought actually,"
00:04:30,00:04:32,are people even coming to see the films?
00:04:32,00:04:35,And so they didn't advertise what film was showing
00:04:35,00:04:36,and the same number of people showed up.
00:04:36,00:04:38,And then they started interviewing people
00:04:38,00:04:39,"as they were driving in and said,"
00:04:39,00:04:40,"""What film are you coming for?"""
00:04:40,00:04:43,And most people didn't know what film they were going to see.
00:04:43,00:04:46,They're just kind of coming 'cause it's a thing to do.
00:04:46,00:04:48,But I think the laundry thing was particularly interesting
00:04:48,00:04:52,because that was about how one of the appeals of the drive-ins
00:04:52,00:04:55,was that it appealed to a much broader audience.
00:04:55,00:04:57,"And so, for instance, one of the people they advertised to"
00:04:57,00:05:00,"was mothers, housewives, because you could bring your kids."
00:05:00,00:05:02,So the idea was you didn't have to find a babysitter
00:05:02,00:05:05,"to leave them at home, brought your kids along."
00:05:05,00:05:08,They also specifically advertised to disabled people
00:05:08,00:05:09,because you can stay in your car.
00:05:09,00:05:12,You don't have to get up and maneuver into a seat.
00:05:12,00:05:15,And they advertised specifically to obese people
00:05:15,00:05:16,"at the start, didn't they?"
00:05:16,00:05:18,I think one of the very first adverts
00:05:18,00:05:20,from the guy who invented the drive-in
00:05:20,00:05:22,was a picture of an overweight lady
00:05:22,00:05:24,trying to squeeze into a cinema seat.
00:05:24,00:05:25,"And then it said something like,"
00:05:25,00:05:28,"""Kate doesn't have any problem at the drive-in."""
00:05:28,00:05:29,"- So she was called Kate Smith,"
00:05:29,00:05:32,the lady who was in that image.
00:05:32,00:05:33,And she was a really famous singer
00:05:33,00:05:36,and she was like the South America's version
00:05:36,00:05:37,of Dame Vera Lynn.
00:05:37,00:05:39,So she was really big during the war
00:05:39,00:05:41,and she sang a load of amazing songs
00:05:41,00:05:43,and everyone got really patriotic about her.
00:05:43,00:05:48,"And she was also, she sang for the Philadelphia Flyers."
00:05:48,00:05:50,"So before the game, before every game,"
00:05:50,00:05:52,"she would sing ""God Bless America."""
00:05:52,00:05:55,"And whenever she sang, they almost always won."
00:05:55,00:06:00,They had a record of 100 wins and 29 losses
00:06:00,00:06:02,and five ties whenever she sang.
00:06:02,00:06:04,And normally it was more like 50/50.
00:06:04,00:06:06,So all the other teams really hated her
00:06:06,00:06:09,because she was just this amazingly good mascot
00:06:09,00:06:10,for that team.
00:06:10,00:06:12,"But yeah, she was super famous Kate Smith."
00:06:12,00:06:13,- I feel terrible.
00:06:13,00:06:15,- I've described her as just an overweight lady
00:06:15,00:06:16,trying to squeeze into her cinema seat.
00:06:16,00:06:18,And she's basically the lovely charm
00:06:18,00:06:19,of the whole United States.
00:06:19,00:06:20,I'm so sorry.
00:06:20,00:06:23,"- But so that was the reason, wasn't it,"
00:06:23,00:06:25,for the whole invention of the drive-in.
00:06:25,00:06:28,"It was 1933, a guy called Richard Hollingshead"
00:06:28,00:06:29,was living in New Jersey
00:06:29,00:06:32,and his mother found cinema seats uncomfortable
00:06:32,00:06:34,and he wanted to fix that.
00:06:34,00:06:36,So he thought if she could watch it
00:06:36,00:06:37,"from the comfort of her car,"
00:06:37,00:06:39,this would be a much better system.
00:06:39,00:06:41,So he rigged up a sort of system
00:06:41,00:06:43,for her to test it out on
00:06:43,00:06:45,"and it's so clever, these sort of innovation"
00:06:45,00:06:47,that he did in the early days.
00:06:47,00:06:49,"Once he had the idea that this could be commercial,"
00:06:49,00:06:51,"the thought of, okay, how do I deal with it"
00:06:51,00:06:53,"if it's raining, for example?"
00:06:53,00:06:54,So he would have his water hose
00:06:54,00:06:57,and sprinkler systems going off in the background
00:06:57,00:06:58,while he tested different ways.
00:06:58,00:07:01,"He thought if cars were gonna be parked behind each other,"
00:07:01,00:07:02,how could they see each other?
00:07:02,00:07:04,So he tested out these sort of ramp systems
00:07:04,00:07:07,"whereby he could levitate, not levitate."
00:07:07,00:07:09,"- Oh no, no, no, he couldn't levitate."
00:07:09,00:07:12,"That would be an amazing innovation, wasn't it?"
00:07:12,00:07:13,When Guardian love your search.
00:07:13,00:07:17,"- That's the helicopter driving your thinking of, Dan."
00:07:17,00:07:19,"Just on bringing your kids, this is a really clever thing"
00:07:19,00:07:22,and how it was advertised.
00:07:22,00:07:25,Lots of cinemas put the playground for the children
00:07:25,00:07:27,'cause the children might not want to sit and watch the film.
00:07:27,00:07:28,They put the playground under the screen.
00:07:28,00:07:31,"So as you were watching the film as a parent,"
00:07:31,00:07:33,you could just check in and see your kids
00:07:33,00:07:35,directly beneath the cinema screen.
00:07:35,00:07:36,- That's so good.
00:07:36,00:07:39,- Although actually not everyone was happy about this idea
00:07:39,00:07:40,that you could bring your kids
00:07:40,00:07:45,"because in 1947, there was a picket outside one"
00:07:45,00:07:48,of the drive-ins by a load of babysitters
00:07:48,00:07:53,"who said, ""Down with drive-ins, more work for babysitters."""
00:07:53,00:07:57,"And while you drive in movie theaters, babysitters starve."
00:07:57,00:08:01,"And so they were outside saying, ""Down with drive-ins."""
00:08:01,00:08:03,- Wow. - Because they were losing money.
00:08:03,00:08:03,- That's amazing. - It feels like
00:08:03,00:08:05,they've kind of won now.
00:08:05,00:08:07,It feels like babysitters have remained culturally necessary
00:08:07,00:08:09,in a way that drive-ins kind of haven't.
00:08:09,00:08:10,- That's true. - Yeah.
00:08:10,00:08:13,- Have you ever heard of another babysitter robot?
00:08:13,00:08:15,(all laughing)
00:08:15,00:08:16,- Is that unique?
00:08:16,00:08:18,"- They're not very heavily unionized, the babysitters."
00:08:18,00:08:20,(all laughing)
00:08:20,00:08:22,"- I think if I was a babysitter,"
00:08:22,00:08:27,I would be really angry with recipe box services.
00:08:27,00:08:28,"Because when I was a babysitter,"
00:08:28,00:08:31,what you'd get is free reign of whatever was in the fridge.
00:08:31,00:08:33,"But with those recipe boxes,"
00:08:33,00:08:35,you only get exactly what you have to cook.
00:08:35,00:08:37,So there's never any spare food.
00:08:37,00:08:40,So it means babysitters are starving in that case.
00:08:40,00:08:40,"- All right, James."
00:08:40,00:08:43,"As an outfit that does some of the advertised hello fresh,"
00:08:43,00:08:45,"I don't know if we need to be putting babysitters off it,"
00:08:45,00:08:47,driving a wedge between them.
00:08:47,00:08:51,"- Well, these babysitters anyway, in near Seattle,"
00:08:51,00:08:52,"they picked it for a while,"
00:08:52,00:08:55,but then they were bought off with a free movie and a hot dog.
00:08:55,00:08:57,- Wow. (all laughing)
00:08:57,00:08:58,- So cheekily bought.
00:08:58,00:09:00,- I think that's what they were going for.
00:09:00,00:09:01,- It could be.
00:09:01,00:09:04,- I don't think driving movies have ever been popular enough
00:09:04,00:09:06,that they've been putting babysitters out of business
00:09:06,00:09:08,on mass.
00:09:08,00:09:10,I think they just wanted a free film.
00:09:10,00:09:12,"- You know, we know what the first movie was"
00:09:12,00:09:15,"to play the drive-in, which is quite cool."
00:09:15,00:09:17,So this was in 1933.
00:09:17,00:09:19,"It's a movie called ""Wives Beware""."
00:09:19,00:09:23,And it is the story of a man who tires of married life
00:09:23,00:09:25,and he feigns memory loss
00:09:25,00:09:28,so that he can then pursue other women.
00:09:28,00:09:29,That's the whole plot.
00:09:29,00:09:30,"So when his wife's like,"
00:09:30,00:09:32,"""Hey, you slept with that lady."""
00:09:32,00:09:33,"He goes, ""Did I?"""
00:09:33,00:09:34,That's weird.
00:09:35,00:09:37,And that was the movie.
00:09:37,00:09:38,"And the reason they had that movie,"
00:09:38,00:09:40,"and this became the thing for drive-throughs,"
00:09:40,00:09:43,was this was a movie that played in cinemas for one week
00:09:43,00:09:45,and then it went off cinemas.
00:09:45,00:09:48,And drive-throughs specifically were playing films
00:09:48,00:09:50,that were not in competition with the cinema.
00:09:50,00:09:53,It was the movies that were no longer on screen there.
00:09:53,00:09:56,And actually the popularity of it started dwindling
00:09:56,00:09:58,to more B movies and then erotic movies.
00:09:58,00:10:01,"- But I think one of the reasons was as well though, Dan,"
00:10:01,00:10:02,is that there was quite a union
00:10:02,00:10:05,between all of the different movie-making studios
00:10:05,00:10:08,"and then America smashed it and whenever it was,"
00:10:08,00:10:10,the '40s or '50s or something like that.
00:10:10,00:10:13,"But before then, basically, if you weren't in on it,"
00:10:13,00:10:15,you couldn't get the best movies.
00:10:15,00:10:18,And so all of the theaters really wanted to stop the drive-ins
00:10:18,00:10:19,from getting the best movies
00:10:19,00:10:21,'cause they thought that everyone would go to the drive-ins
00:10:21,00:10:24,"instead of going to the theaters, I think."
00:10:24,00:10:26,"- Yeah, I think they were more forced into the position,"
00:10:26,00:10:27,weren't they?
00:10:27,00:10:29,Because no one would actually sell them the popular release.
00:10:29,00:10:32,"And like Anna says, no one really cared what was on, right?"
00:10:32,00:10:35,"- No, they just went there to snog."
00:10:35,00:10:36,- They just went there to snog.
00:10:36,00:10:38,So there was a real big problem.
00:10:38,00:10:41,It wasn't just the baby sisters who didn't like the drive-ins.
00:10:41,00:10:44,It was also the puritanical people
00:10:44,00:10:47,'cause they were worried about nekkers.
00:10:47,00:10:49,"So when the first one opened in Camden,"
00:10:49,00:10:51,"this first one, Hollingshead's one,"
00:10:51,00:10:53,"that we were talking about, a writer noted,"
00:10:53,00:10:55,"""Perhaps it will occur readily enough to the reader"
00:10:55,00:10:57,"""what fun young America could have"
00:10:57,00:11:00,"""in a coop under the added stimulation"
00:11:00,00:11:02,"""of a sophisticated romance."""
00:11:02,00:11:04,So that was the first one that came
00:11:04,00:11:05,and they were already saying
00:11:05,00:11:08,that people might be snogging in the cars.
00:11:08,00:11:11,"- They were very paranoid, weren't they?"
00:11:11,00:11:14,"- They were quite paranoid, but I mean, it did happen."
00:11:14,00:11:16,"- Oh yeah, a lot of snogging went on."
00:11:16,00:11:17,"- Yeah, one of the owners said,"
00:11:17,00:11:19,"""The only thing that can slow us down"
00:11:19,00:11:21,"""is an ugly rumour going around"
00:11:21,00:11:23,"""that the drive-in are perfect for nekkers."""
00:11:23,00:11:26,"- They did have people go around checking, didn't they?"
00:11:26,00:11:27,- Checking for necking.
00:11:27,00:11:29,"- They had necker checkers, yeah."
00:11:29,00:11:31,So a lot of them employed policemen
00:11:31,00:11:33,or just members of staff who had to go around
00:11:33,00:11:34,and look in people's windows
00:11:34,00:11:37,'cause they got this reputation as being passion pits.
00:11:37,00:11:41,"And the reputation was from people called blue noses,"
00:11:41,00:11:42,"which I'd never heard before,"
00:11:42,00:11:46,but it's a term for sort of prudish church types in America.
00:11:46,00:11:49,And various drive-ins would have rules
00:11:49,00:11:50,"about what was allowed,"
00:11:50,00:11:53,"so one owner of a drive-in specified,"
00:11:53,00:11:56,"if a man puts his arm around a woman, that's okay,"
00:11:56,00:11:58,but if she puts her arm back around him
00:11:58,00:12:02,"and then they go into a clinch, that's out."
00:12:02,00:12:04,And then they're removed from the premises.
00:12:04,00:12:06,So that's where the line is.
00:12:06,00:12:10,"- There was an actual law against it in 1972 in New Jersey,"
00:12:10,00:12:12,which would find the operator $100
00:12:12,00:12:14,if any cars remained on the premises
00:12:14,00:12:17,one hour after the end of the show.
00:12:17,00:12:19,And they said that the reason was
00:12:19,00:12:23,"because they didn't want any carbon monoxide deaths,"
00:12:23,00:12:25,but actually it was just to stop the neckers.
00:12:25,00:12:29,"- If you can't get your necking done within an hour, then, you know."
00:12:29,00:12:31,"- I genuinely didn't know what the word ""necking"" meant,"
00:12:31,00:12:35,"so I Googled it, and apparently it's a short, plain, concave section"
00:12:35,00:12:36,between the capital and the shaft
00:12:36,00:12:39,"of a classical Doric-Ortuskin column,"
00:12:39,00:12:41,but just in case people were hearing.
00:12:41,00:12:46,- You probably need a third person to be in the car with you
00:12:46,00:12:49,"to not be caught out for necking, right?"
00:12:49,00:12:52,Because it's hard to see what's going on around you
00:12:52,00:12:55,"when you're kissing, and generally,"
00:12:55,00:12:58,kissing sort of etiquette means you have to have your eyes closed.
00:12:58,00:13:01,"So if you had your eyes open while kissing,"
00:13:01,00:13:04,"A, you risk being a weirdo, but you are safer, I guess."
00:13:04,00:13:06,"- If the other person has their eyes open as well,"
00:13:06,00:13:09,"then they're a weirdo, so you can usually get away with it"
00:13:09,00:13:10,because they have their eyes closed.
00:13:10,00:13:12,"- You're right, one person has to have their eyes open at all times"
00:13:12,00:13:14,"looking for blue noses,"
00:13:14,00:13:17,and the other person gets on with removing their neckers.
00:13:17,00:13:20,"- Well, no, you need both with eyes open because all you're getting"
00:13:20,00:13:23,is you're getting that window only of your position.
00:13:23,00:13:25,"- You can have a mini Periscope installed in the car,"
00:13:25,00:13:28,and then you can just see all the way around you at all times.
00:13:28,00:13:30,"- Oh, that's cool. In which case, you only need one eye open."
00:13:30,00:13:32,"- I don't want to be a female in the car with you, Andy,"
00:13:32,00:13:34,when you say Periscope up.
00:13:34,00:13:36,(laughing)
00:13:36,00:13:40,The second ever drive-in was built by a man called
00:13:40,00:13:42,Wilson Shankwaila.
00:13:42,00:13:44,"It was, wow."
00:13:44,00:13:47,"He was from Pennsylvania,"
00:13:47,00:13:51,"and they tried to stop it by taxing him,"
00:13:51,00:13:55,"and so they wanted to give him a massive amusement tax,"
00:13:55,00:13:58,and he tried to avoid it by advertising it as
00:13:58,00:14:01,free movies parking 50 cents.
00:14:01,00:14:04,"So it was like, he advertised it as just a parking lot"
00:14:04,00:14:06,that just happens to have free movies happening.
00:14:06,00:14:08,- That's what he did.
00:14:08,00:14:10,- Shankwaila is another activity that was banned.
00:14:10,00:14:12,(laughing)
00:14:12,00:14:18,"- Okay, it is time for fact number two, and that is my fact."
00:14:18,00:14:21,My fact this week is that the Beatles once rejected
00:14:21,00:14:25,a 50 million pound reunion gig because the Warm-Up Act
00:14:25,00:14:28,was going to be a man wrestling a great white shark.
00:14:28,00:14:30,"This is according to Ringo Starr,"
00:14:30,00:14:33,who revealed this in an interview recently
00:14:33,00:14:35,"in the lead-up to his 80th birthday,"
00:14:35,00:14:38,"and he was talking about how back in 1975,"
00:14:38,00:14:42,they were approached by a incredible character
00:14:42,00:14:46,"called Bill Sargent, who wanted to reunite them,"
00:14:46,00:14:48,"and he had 50 million pounds,"
00:14:48,00:14:51,"which is roughly 200 million pounds in today's money,"
00:14:51,00:14:53,"and the idea was for them to do this gig,"
00:14:53,00:14:55,"and according to the Beatles,"
00:14:55,00:14:58,the pitch was that it was going to be a Warm-Up Act
00:14:58,00:15:00,of a man underwater fighting a shark.
00:15:00,00:15:04,"Now, I think Ringo's muddled this story a bit."
00:15:04,00:15:06,I don't think that great white shark
00:15:06,00:15:07,was going to be the Warm-Up Act.
00:15:07,00:15:08,"However, Bill Sargent--"
00:15:08,00:15:11,"- No, you put the great white shark on last."
00:15:11,00:15:13,"- Of course, there's no way the Beatles"
00:15:13,00:15:15,can follow a man fighting a shark.
00:15:15,00:15:17,It's going to be such a letdown for the audience.
00:15:17,00:15:18,Even the Beatles reuniting.
00:15:18,00:15:19,"- You've got a man with a shark,"
00:15:19,00:15:22,"and then some people saying, ""I am a walrus."""
00:15:22,00:15:23,Come on.
00:15:23,00:15:25,- Octopus' garden.
00:15:25,00:15:26,"Now, desperately trying to think of--"
00:15:26,00:15:28,they would have needed a yellow submarine
00:15:28,00:15:31,in order to get to the stage.
00:15:31,00:15:33,I can play this all night.
00:15:33,00:15:34,"- OK, we can wait."
00:15:34,00:15:35,I'll leave for another one.
00:15:35,00:15:38,[laughter]
00:15:38,00:15:41,"Also, I'm not sure he had 50 million dollars,"
00:15:41,00:15:43,"'cause he was like the father of pay-per-view, wasn't he?"
00:15:43,00:15:46,"So his idea was that he would put it on,"
00:15:46,00:15:47,"and then people would pay to watch it,"
00:15:47,00:15:49,and then the Beatles would get the money from that one day.
00:15:49,00:15:51,- Oh. - I think so.
00:15:51,00:15:53,- I see. - But he said--
00:15:53,00:15:55,"there was an interview with him in 1976,"
00:15:55,00:15:57,"and he said, ""I definitely asked them to do this,"
00:15:57,00:16:00,"and as far as I know, they're considering it."""
00:16:00,00:16:02,But he said that the problem was that Paul McCartney
00:16:02,00:16:04,"was about to start a US tour,"
00:16:04,00:16:07,"a 20-day US tour that was going to be huge for McCartney,"
00:16:07,00:16:11,and that it was because he didn't want to bring the Beatles
00:16:11,00:16:14,back together quite yet that it didn't happen.
00:16:14,00:16:16,That was quite a sergeant.
00:16:16,00:16:19,"James, I don't know if we read the same thing about Bill Sargent."
00:16:19,00:16:21,I was reading People magazine from 1976.
00:16:21,00:16:23,- Same article. - Nice.
00:16:23,00:16:25,"I reckon probably about 15 years,"
00:16:25,00:16:27,"no one else has read that article,"
00:16:27,00:16:28,and then four people read it this week.
00:16:28,00:16:30,[laughter]
00:16:30,00:16:32,The People and People magazine are going to be so excited
00:16:32,00:16:33,by the sudden boost.
00:16:33,00:16:35,"Yeah. Do you think the office, there was a ping noise"
00:16:35,00:16:37,that went on four times?
00:16:37,00:16:39,[laughter]
00:16:39,00:16:42,"But it was so funny, 'cause it reported that this guy,"
00:16:42,00:16:44,"Bill Sargent, had made and lost a million dollars"
00:16:44,00:16:46,"seven times over, and he'd also had two heart attacks."
00:16:46,00:16:49,"And then it said, ""As of now, the Beatles seem more likely"
00:16:49,00:16:51,to provide Sargent with coronary number three
00:16:51,00:16:53,"than fortune number eight."""
00:16:53,00:16:56,"Yeah, and actually, the guy who bought the Great Work Shark,"
00:16:56,00:16:58,"I think, might have caused another coronary,"
00:16:58,00:17:01,because that was also supposed to happen
00:17:01,00:17:04,"as a pay-per-view thing, and they even made the posters"
00:17:04,00:17:06,"and everything, but Bill Sargent had a heart attack"
00:17:06,00:17:07,"before they could do it, and so they..."
00:17:07,00:17:09,"- Oh, yeah. - Yeah."
00:17:09,00:17:12,I actually found the press release that they issued
00:17:12,00:17:16,"to companies around the world about this big fight,"
00:17:16,00:17:18,and it's remarkable reading.
00:17:18,00:17:20,It's about six pages long.
00:17:20,00:17:22,"It's written in such great, so in the most unusual,"
00:17:22,00:17:25,"deaf-defying event ever to come to the screen,"
00:17:25,00:17:27,Bill Sargent has announced that he will bring a life fight
00:17:27,00:17:29,to the death between a single man
00:17:29,00:17:31,and a giant live man-eating shark
00:17:31,00:17:33,"to theater, arena, and coliseum screens"
00:17:33,00:17:35,by satellite closed-circuit television.
00:17:35,00:17:38,"And it was a guy called Wally Gibbons,"
00:17:38,00:17:40,"who was a shark expert,"
00:17:40,00:17:43,"and he was gonna be given a spear,"
00:17:43,00:17:45,and that is how he was gonna fight the shark.
00:17:45,00:17:47,"And the sharks, three of them,"
00:17:47,00:17:49,"were gonna be brought five weeks early to Samoa,"
00:17:49,00:17:51,"where the fight was gonna occur,"
00:17:51,00:17:53,"so they could acclimatize to the water,"
00:17:53,00:17:56,"and in the 48 hours leading up to the fight,"
00:17:56,00:17:58,they were gonna be starved.
00:17:58,00:18:02,"So Wally was gonna have to fight a starving shark,"
00:18:02,00:18:05,"and he said a lot about, in this press release,"
00:18:05,00:18:07,about what he thought his odds were of surviving.
00:18:07,00:18:10,He thought if he could shoot the shark with the speargun
00:18:10,00:18:13,"first time and get him, that was gonna bring the odds up,"
00:18:13,00:18:16,but he needed to shoot it about five times to kill it.
00:18:16,00:18:19,-But what about the two other sharks? -Yeah.
00:18:19,00:18:20,-They were backup sharks. -They're holding the towel
00:18:20,00:18:23,and the bucket and they're holding it.
00:18:23,00:18:25,"Can I ask you, Addy, if you're in the water,"
00:18:25,00:18:27,what are you keeping in the bucket?
00:18:27,00:18:28,I don't know.
00:18:28,00:18:33,I don't think it would have defied death.
00:18:33,00:18:34,I think it would have really embraced death.
00:18:34,00:18:37,"I have a suspicion that old Wally, the absolute Wally,"
00:18:37,00:18:39,would have died within maybe five seconds.
00:18:39,00:18:41,-Ah. -Because I don't think...
00:18:41,00:18:43,"-Do you think? -Yeah, I think so, because..."
00:18:43,00:18:44,I don't know.
00:18:44,00:18:47,"I think that he tried this a few times,"
00:18:47,00:18:49,"because there was someone called Geoffrey Mann,"
00:18:49,00:18:52,who wrote a book later in life about Bill Sargent
00:18:52,00:18:55,"trying to get him to fight a shark in Samoa as well,"
00:18:55,00:18:57,which you've got to assume is the same kind of setup.
00:18:57,00:19:00,"And apparently that was cancelled, according to this guy,"
00:19:00,00:19:03,"cancelled last minute by Jack Cousteau,"
00:19:03,00:19:06,"who... I don't know what he was doing, being involved in the event,"
00:19:06,00:19:09,"but a famed oceanographer, Jack Cousteau,"
00:19:09,00:19:11,cancelled this shark fight.
00:19:11,00:19:13,"But he was going to have a knife,"
00:19:13,00:19:15,which I think is going to be quite similar to a spear.
00:19:15,00:19:18,"And in the end, I was looking up how you'd kill a shark"
00:19:18,00:19:19,if you faced it.
00:19:19,00:19:23,"And stabbing it is the worst possible thing you can do,"
00:19:23,00:19:24,according to a guy called William Johnson.
00:19:24,00:19:27,It's not the worst. The worst thing is to climb into its mouth.
00:19:27,00:19:28,Yeah.
00:19:28,00:19:30,"He actually does say, when he's giving advice, he says,"
00:19:30,00:19:33,"""Go for the face and gills, because they're quite sensitive."""
00:19:33,00:19:34,"So, you know, like punching them in the face."
00:19:34,00:19:37,But do try to keep your hands out of its mouth.
00:19:37,00:19:38,That's always the best thing.
00:19:38,00:19:41,"But Wally Gibbons was an interesting guy, wasn't he?"
00:19:41,00:19:46,"Like, there was a 1952 contest between fishermen and spearmen,"
00:19:46,00:19:49,which were people who caught fish with spears.
00:19:49,00:19:53,And he caught more fish than all the 37 fishermen
00:19:53,00:19:55,who were in that competition on his own.
00:19:55,00:19:56,Wow.
00:19:56,00:19:59,"He was amazing. And just after World War II,"
00:19:59,00:20:01,"he swam around the Solomon Islands,"
00:20:01,00:20:04,"picking up, like, unexploded shells,"
00:20:04,00:20:07,and then taking them away so that they wouldn't affect people
00:20:07,00:20:09,"in the future. Isn't that amazing, Wally?"
00:20:09,00:20:11,"That's really cool. Yeah, he was incredible."
00:20:11,00:20:14,There's a biography in this press release where they say
00:20:14,00:20:17,that he has killed more sharks in man-to-fish underwater combat
00:20:17,00:20:21,than any other man in Australia and possibly in the world.
00:20:21,00:20:25,"I mean, so, yeah, I find it unlikely that anyone from"
00:20:25,00:20:28,anywhere else in Australia would have killed any sharks
00:20:28,00:20:29,in man-to-fish fights.
00:20:29,00:20:30,"And it should sign, probably, that."
00:20:30,00:20:32,"Yeah, he was known as a man-fish."
00:20:32,00:20:34,That's what they called him.
00:20:34,00:20:35,Merman. We've got a name for a mountain fish.
00:20:35,00:20:37,It's a merman.
00:20:37,00:20:41,Wally Gibbons also had the best collection of seashells
00:20:41,00:20:42,in the whole of Australia.
00:20:42,00:20:45,He had the world's rarest shell.
00:20:45,00:20:47,"He owned it, the Gloria Maris,"
00:20:47,00:20:50,which is also known as the Glory of the Seacone.
00:20:50,00:20:54,And that shell used to be so rare
00:20:54,00:20:57,that there was once a collector who bought one in an auction
00:20:57,00:21:00,only to immediately destroy it so that he had the only one
00:21:00,00:21:02,because he found this other one that was...
00:21:02,00:21:04,"He didn't want two in the world to exist,"
00:21:04,00:21:06,so he bought one in the auction when it came up
00:21:06,00:21:09,"and he destroyed it, so he had the only one."
00:21:09,00:21:09,That's pretty sick.
00:21:09,00:21:11,"Supposedly, that was in 1792."
00:21:11,00:21:14,But then there was only a few of them in the world.
00:21:14,00:21:16,Wally Gibbons had one of them.
00:21:16,00:21:20,"And when proper scuba diving got invented, they found..."
00:21:20,00:21:22,"Oh, yeah, they're just down there."
00:21:22,00:21:24,They were just a bit lower than we could normally go.
00:21:24,00:21:27,"So people, you can collect them quite easily now."
00:21:27,00:21:29,You could buy them for not too much.
00:21:29,00:21:31,I think that would be a disappointing
00:21:31,00:21:33,if the shark fight couldn't go ahead.
00:21:33,00:21:36,"But he said, ""But don't worry, Wally Gibbons"
00:21:36,00:21:39,"""will be showing you his seashell collection."""
00:21:39,00:21:42,"Because I was thinking, Anna said that he would die after five minutes."
00:21:42,00:21:44,"If you're the Beatles and you're thinking,"
00:21:44,00:21:47,"""Okay, we're going on in an hour after the fight."""
00:21:47,00:21:48,"And then after five minutes, they're like,"
00:21:48,00:21:50,"""Well, sorry, the guy just got eaten,"
00:21:50,00:21:51,"""so you're going to have to go on early."""
00:21:51,00:21:52,I'd be pretty pissed off.
00:21:52,00:21:55,"Also, there's a bit of a weird vibe in the audience right now."
00:21:55,00:21:58,(LAUGHTER)
00:21:58,00:22:00,"They probably had a back-up, warmer-backed,"
00:22:00,00:22:02,which was a therapist to come out on stage
00:22:02,00:22:05,to help everyone deal with the massacre they'd just seen.
00:22:05,00:22:09,"Can I just say one weird, interesting thing about Bill Sargent,"
00:22:09,00:22:10,"the guy who Dan mentioned at the start,"
00:22:10,00:22:12,who was organising the shark fights.
00:22:12,00:22:14,So he was an inventor. He invented tons of stuff.
00:22:14,00:22:18,"He had, I think, over 400 patents, so gadget patents."
00:22:18,00:22:20,And one thing that I think he invented
00:22:20,00:22:23,"is something that we think of as new, which is televised theatre."
00:22:23,00:22:26,"So, you know, now you can go and see the National Theatre Live"
00:22:26,00:22:28,"at your local cinema,"
00:22:28,00:22:31,or you could before the theatre stopped happening.
00:22:31,00:22:33,And he invented the precursor to this called
00:22:33,00:22:36,"""Electronovision"" in the 1960s."
00:22:36,00:22:40,"And so, basically, it involved him going in and videotaping plays"
00:22:40,00:22:43,and then broadcasting them in cinemas.
00:22:43,00:22:44,And he made loads of money out of it.
00:22:44,00:22:49,And the first one he did was a tape of Richard Burton in Hamlet in 1964.
00:22:49,00:22:50,"And he filmed three separate productions,"
00:22:50,00:22:53,then edited them together to get the best best of.
00:22:53,00:22:58,"Highlights showed in 1,000 cinemas and made him millions of dollars."
00:22:58,00:22:59,Amazing.
00:22:59,00:23:01,"Bill Sargent's first job was a radio repairman,"
00:23:01,00:23:04,which he had at the age of six.
00:23:04,00:23:07,- Wow. - So he started work at the age of six.
00:23:07,00:23:09,"In fairness, it was in the family workshop,"
00:23:09,00:23:11,which was attached to his family home.
00:23:11,00:23:15,"Unfortunately, a year later, he burnt them both down by accident."
00:23:15,00:23:18,"And then later on, when he got a load of money for his movies,"
00:23:18,00:23:20,he set up an electronics laboratory in Missouri.
00:23:20,00:23:23,But then he burned that down as well.
00:23:23,00:23:26,So he had kind of had a habit of burning down electronic shops.
00:23:26,00:23:30,"That time, when he burned down the second one, James,"
00:23:30,00:23:33,"apparently it was because he put down, just not really thinking,"
00:23:33,00:23:36,he put down a welding torch in the wrong place.
00:23:36,00:23:39,He put it onto a drum of paint thinner or thinner.
00:23:39,00:23:42,So kind of the winch is obviously highly flammable.
00:23:42,00:23:44,"According, I guess, to him,"
00:23:44,00:23:45,"because I don't think there were many other people around,"
00:23:45,00:23:48,he was blown 170 feet into the air.
00:23:48,00:23:53,- What's 170 feet? - No.
00:23:53,00:23:56,- That's impossible. - Someone's flying over to the drive-in fare
00:23:56,00:23:57,"to go, ""What the fuck was that?"""
00:23:57,00:24:01,(LAUGHTER)
00:24:01,00:24:04,"- 170 feet. - Yep, that's what he says."
00:24:04,00:24:05,Well...
00:24:05,00:24:07,I love him. Love this man so much.
00:24:07,00:24:10,So this thing of a man fighting a shark
00:24:10,00:24:13,"was basically an insane, weird, warm-up act."
00:24:13,00:24:16,"And so I looked into a few other weird acts,"
00:24:16,00:24:19,"like kind of vaudeville acts from, you know, the last century."
00:24:19,00:24:21,"So have you heard of Haji Ali,"
00:24:21,00:24:23,who was also known as the Egyptian enigma?
00:24:23,00:24:25,- Oh? - He was amazing.
00:24:25,00:24:27,"OK, so he was a vaudeville performer."
00:24:27,00:24:30,"His act was to swallow kerosene,"
00:24:30,00:24:33,"then he would swallow some water, OK?"
00:24:33,00:24:35,Then he would regurgitate the kerosene
00:24:35,00:24:37,"and set it on fire, as he did so."
00:24:37,00:24:41,But then he would regurgitate the water to put out the fire
00:24:41,00:24:43,that he had lit from the kerosene.
00:24:43,00:24:46,- So cool. - I think he was also known as the human volcano.
00:24:46,00:24:47,Or something like that.
00:24:47,00:24:49,And then there's just one line about him saying
00:24:49,00:24:52,he would also regurgitate live goldfish and nuts.
00:24:52,00:24:54,(LAUGHTER)
00:24:54,00:24:57,"The nuts was actually more impressive than it sounds, wasn't it,"
00:24:57,00:24:59,"with Haji Ali, because he..."
00:24:59,00:25:01,One of his tricks was being able to regurgitate stuff
00:25:01,00:25:03,in the order specified by the audience.
00:25:03,00:25:05,"So he'd swallow a bunch of objects and then be like,"
00:25:05,00:25:08,"""All right, bring up the goldfish now. OK, bring up your braces."""
00:25:08,00:25:11,"And so he'd swallow, for instance, 50 hazelnuts"
00:25:11,00:25:13,and one almond.
00:25:13,00:25:16,And he'd start regurgitating them one by one.
00:25:16,00:25:18,"And when an audience member said, ""Bring up the almond now, mate,"""
00:25:18,00:25:20,he'd call the almond up.
00:25:20,00:25:22,- And within. - It's amazing.
00:25:22,00:25:24,"- Apparently. - Oh, my God."
00:25:24,00:25:27,I genuinely think if you gave me a bowl of nuts
00:25:27,00:25:29,"and said, ""Which one of those is an almond?"""
00:25:29,00:25:30,I would struggle.
00:25:30,00:25:31,(LAUGHTER)
00:25:31,00:25:33,Maybe that's what he was relying on.
00:25:33,00:25:35,He just told the audience it was an almond.
00:25:35,00:25:37,(LAUGHTER)
00:25:37,00:25:40,I can say one more Borderville thing related to animals.
00:25:40,00:25:42,"And this was an amazing act,"
00:25:42,00:25:45,which was a group of women called the Barrison Sisters.
00:25:45,00:25:48,And it seems like their entire act
00:25:48,00:25:50,was to do a little bit of a sexy dance
00:25:50,00:25:52,that gets more and more sexy.
00:25:52,00:25:54,"And all the way through, they would ask the audience,"
00:25:54,00:25:56,"""Would you like to see my pussy?"""
00:25:56,00:25:58,"And then when eventually, the audience said, ""Yes,"""
00:25:58,00:26:02,they would lift their skirts and they would all have a cat in their knickers.
00:26:02,00:26:03,(LAUGHTER)
00:26:03,00:26:07,And that was absolutely massive.
00:26:07,00:26:08,They were huge.
00:26:08,00:26:10,"They were so famous, these people."
00:26:10,00:26:14,They played Berlin for eight months with this act.
00:26:14,00:26:16,(LAUGHTER)
00:26:16,00:26:18,"- They played a... - But is it like the mousetrap, James?"
00:26:18,00:26:21,"Are they like, ""Please don't tell anyone the spoiler when you leave?"""
00:26:21,00:26:23,"It must be, right? It must be that."
00:26:23,00:26:25,They must have been exactly like that.
00:26:25,00:26:28,And there was a French nobleman who committed suicide
00:26:28,00:26:30,because he loved one of them so much.
00:26:30,00:26:33,"And they were so shocking that after the eight months in Berlin,"
00:26:33,00:26:36,they were banned from ever re-entering Germany.
00:26:36,00:26:39,I love the fact that they waited eight months to ban them.
00:26:39,00:26:41,"It's like, ""Okay, now that everyone in Germany"
00:26:41,00:26:43,"""has had a chance to see you, now you're banned."""
00:26:43,00:26:46,Because now that's not appropriate.
00:26:46,00:26:49,"The censors went countless times, thousands of times."
00:26:49,00:26:51,"Yeah, we're just trying to assess whether or not"
00:26:51,00:26:53,it really is offensive enough to ban.
00:26:53,00:26:57,"Just like a few more months of seeing them, to be sure."
00:26:57,00:26:59,"- Were the cats alive? - Yeah, they were alive."
00:26:59,00:27:02,"They were in, like, a little pouch over their crutches."
00:27:02,00:27:06,So the cats had to sit there in between their legs for the full act.
00:27:06,00:27:07,- They must have been sedated. - Yeah.
00:27:07,00:27:10,"I don't know whether they regurgitated them somehow or what,"
00:27:10,00:27:12,but they were definitely there.
00:27:12,00:27:13,"And there was an article about them,"
00:27:13,00:27:16,"and one guy in New York said,"
00:27:16,00:27:19,"""It was the most audacious piece of devilry and abandonment"
00:27:19,00:27:23,"""I ever saw offered to a New York public."""
00:27:23,00:27:24,Wow.
00:27:24,00:27:25,I really thought you were going to say that he committed suicide
00:27:25,00:27:28,because he was so disappointed when they lifted up their skirts
00:27:28,00:27:30,"at the end, and he didn't see their vaginas."
00:27:30,00:27:32,Yeah.
00:27:32,00:27:35,Just ask only a cat.
00:27:35,00:27:37,It's all been for nothing.
00:27:37,00:27:42,"OK, it's time for fact number three, and that is Anna."
00:27:42,00:27:45,"My fact this week is that in 1919,"
00:27:45,00:27:48,it was ruled that women would be allowed to swim competitively
00:27:48,00:27:51,without wearing stockings on the one condition
00:27:51,00:27:55,that they quickly put on a robe as soon as they got out of the water.
00:27:55,00:27:59,And this was specifically in America.
00:27:59,00:28:01,"And I think these are nylon stockings,"
00:28:01,00:28:03,"because there weren't been any nylon in 1919, would they?"
00:28:03,00:28:05,So was it wool or what?
00:28:05,00:28:06,I think they were wool.
00:28:06,00:28:10,I think quite a lot of people had to wear woolen stuff in the water.
00:28:10,00:28:13,"That's not going to be conducive to a quick swim, is it?"
00:28:13,00:28:15,It's like carrying a sheep while you're swimming.
00:28:15,00:28:16,Yeah.
00:28:16,00:28:19,"It's like that, did you guys all do that swimming survival test"
00:28:19,00:28:21,"when you were younger, where you had to wear pyjamas in the water?"
00:28:21,00:28:23,"It was like every time a woman swam in the water,"
00:28:23,00:28:25,it was like having to do that survival test.
00:28:25,00:28:27,"In every Olympics, they had to pick up a brick"
00:28:27,00:28:29,"from the bottom of the pool, didn't they?"
00:28:29,00:28:31,Yeah.
00:28:31,00:28:35,"So this was in America, and it was the Amateur Athletics Union,"
00:28:35,00:28:37,which had only recently allowed women to take part
00:28:37,00:28:39,in competitive swimming events anyway.
00:28:39,00:28:43,"But it was very controversial what women would wear in the water,"
00:28:43,00:28:47,and they essentially had to be covered from neck to toe fully.
00:28:47,00:28:49,"And this irritated the women,"
00:28:49,00:28:52,because they realised that this would put them at a massive disadvantage
00:28:52,00:28:53,"in the Olympics, for instance,"
00:28:53,00:28:56,"when they were competing against other countries like Australia,"
00:28:56,00:28:58,"who were a bit looser with their regulations,"
00:28:58,00:29:03,and they would be weighed down by their massive cotton waterlogs
00:29:03,00:29:06,and head-to-toe outfits while the Aussies were smashing them.
00:29:06,00:29:08,So there was sort of a campaign.
00:29:08,00:29:11,"There was this amazing woman called Charlotte Epstein,"
00:29:11,00:29:12,"who was a court stenographer, actually,"
00:29:12,00:29:17,and she'd formed the Women's Swimming Association in 1917.
00:29:17,00:29:21,And she campaigned to have the stocking requirement removed.
00:29:21,00:29:23,"And eventually she did this stunt,"
00:29:23,00:29:25,"where she invited some of the best women in the country,"
00:29:25,00:29:27,"female swimmers in the country,"
00:29:27,00:29:29,to come to a beach in California
00:29:29,00:29:32,and strip down to ordinary swimsuits without stockings.
00:29:32,00:29:34,And they were all arrested.
00:29:34,00:29:37,And she invited the tabloids to see them all be arrested.
00:29:37,00:29:40,And this kind of created this atmosphere of how ridiculous is this?
00:29:40,00:29:42,Women are just being arrested for wearing swimming costumes.
00:29:42,00:29:45,"Come on, guys, sort your shit out."
00:29:45,00:29:46,And so they relaxed the rules.
00:29:46,00:29:50,But you did have to very quickly put on a robe as soon as you emerged.
00:29:50,00:29:53,"Yeah, the rules were pretty strict, weren't they, back in the day?"
00:29:53,00:29:57,"Like, in 1921, in New York,"
00:29:57,00:30:01,"everyone had to wear a two-piece swimming suit, everyone."
00:30:01,00:30:04,And there was a specific law that made it illegal
00:30:04,00:30:07,for any bold men to stare at women.
00:30:07,00:30:09,"Yeah, I saw that. What does that mean?"
00:30:09,00:30:11,I couldn't find...
00:30:11,00:30:14,"I think that was one person on the beach,"
00:30:14,00:30:16,"like the person who was monitoring that beach,"
00:30:16,00:30:19,who thought that bold men were sort of equated with perverts.
00:30:19,00:30:22,"And he said, ""I'm going to stop bold men from staring at women."""
00:30:22,00:30:24,It's so strange.
00:30:24,00:30:27,"Maybe there was a specific bold man that they were worried about,"
00:30:27,00:30:30,"like, Stairy Steve, and they sort of said,"
00:30:30,00:30:32,"""Well, we can't say Stairy Steve is found from the beach,"
00:30:32,00:30:34,"""but we will say this."""
00:30:34,00:30:37,"Yeah, well, weren't hats very popular back then?"
00:30:37,00:30:39,"So maybe bold means a hatless,"
00:30:39,00:30:43,because maybe they were taking their hat down to hide a protrusion below.
00:30:43,00:30:47,"Is that how, you know, how they always say in the olden days,"
00:30:47,00:30:50,"whenever you met a lady, you had to lift your hat?"
00:30:50,00:30:53,"It wasn't to hide your protrusion, Dan."
00:30:53,00:30:57,"The taller the hat, the bigger the brag."
00:30:57,00:31:00,You remember Mr. Darcy always had a very tall top hat.
00:31:00,00:31:02,"But that's how you catch them, is that you just say,"
00:31:02,00:31:04,"""Can you show me your hands, please?"""
00:31:04,00:31:06,"And if the hat stays where it is on their lap,"
00:31:06,00:31:09,then you know that there's a protrusion situation.
00:31:09,00:31:14,"In the Olympics, the first time that women swam in the Olympics,"
00:31:14,00:31:16,"I think, was in 1912."
00:31:16,00:31:19,And the British team had to wear a bra and knickers
00:31:19,00:31:22,"while they swam, as well as their swimsuit."
00:31:22,00:31:26,And that's because they had this amazingly awesome silk swimsuit
00:31:26,00:31:28,that would help them to swim really fast.
00:31:28,00:31:31,But it was completely see-through when it got wet.
00:31:31,00:31:33,"And so, I mean, it was amazing."
00:31:33,00:31:35,"It was so thin, the silk,"
00:31:35,00:31:37,that you could take the whole thing and pass it through a wedding ring.
00:31:37,00:31:40,That's how thin the material was.
00:31:40,00:31:42,"But it did have that one problem that it was see-through,"
00:31:42,00:31:43,so you had to wear underwear as well.
00:31:43,00:31:47,And was it a Superman situation where it's on top of the outfit?
00:31:48,00:31:50,"I've seen the pictures and they were on the inside,"
00:31:50,00:31:52,"but definitely they should have gone the outside, shouldn't they?"
00:31:52,00:31:53,Yeah.
00:31:53,00:31:56,I find it really bizarre that women weren't encouraged to swim
00:31:56,00:31:58,until about the 19th century.
00:31:58,00:32:03,"So this only really became a situation then or late on then,"
00:32:03,00:32:06,"because before that, if you were a woman, you just didn't swim."
00:32:06,00:32:09,I thought there's very little evidence of women swimming
00:32:09,00:32:11,before the 17th century.
00:32:11,00:32:12,There is some.
00:32:12,00:32:16,"Yeah, I found the description of a standard ladies' bathing costume"
00:32:16,00:32:20,"in 1687 by someone called Celia Fiennes,"
00:32:20,00:32:24,"who said it was made of fine yellow canvas,"
00:32:24,00:32:26,"which made it that when you went in the water,"
00:32:26,00:32:27,"it filled up with water,"
00:32:27,00:32:30,so no one could see the shape of your body.
00:32:30,00:32:31,Crafty.
00:32:31,00:32:33,"I'm clever, like a Mr. Blobby costume."
00:32:33,00:32:36,"A Mr. Blobby, yeah, because you can never tell how sexy"
00:32:36,00:32:39,"the person playing Mr. Blobby is, can't you?"
00:32:39,00:32:42,They don't need to be sexy on the inside
00:32:42,00:32:45,"if they're wearing a Mr. Blobby costume, I'm theirs."
00:32:45,00:32:48,"And in the 18th century in the UK, they made laws."
00:32:48,00:32:51,Every town could make its own laws about what you would wear
00:32:51,00:32:52,when you were swimming.
00:32:52,00:32:55,"So in the city of Bath,"
00:32:55,00:32:59,they made it illegal for men to swim without a waistcoat.
00:32:59,00:33:00,No.
00:33:00,00:33:07,"Is that with, would men have to have the sort of the top as well,"
00:33:07,00:33:09,or is this bare chest with a waistcoat on?
00:33:09,00:33:11,I think the waistcoat just referred to anything
00:33:11,00:33:13,"that would cover your chest, really."
00:33:13,00:33:16,It wasn't like a proper top hat and tails kind of thing.
00:33:16,00:33:17,Yeah.
00:33:17,00:33:21,Did you guys come across Donald Clark in your research?
00:33:21,00:33:22,Yeah.
00:33:22,00:33:25,"He was an early, he was very much fighting the tide of history."
00:33:25,00:33:27,He was an opponent to mixed swimming.
00:33:27,00:33:30,"He was a counsellor in Tonbridge,"
00:33:30,00:33:35,"and he said that by making girls look like wet Scotch terriers,"
00:33:35,00:33:38,mixed bathing stops more marriages than any other cause
00:33:38,00:33:40,and much unrest in the country
00:33:40,00:33:42,due to the barbarous licence of women's dress.
00:33:42,00:33:44,So he was basically saying women look like such mingers
00:33:44,00:33:47,when they've been in the water that no one will want to marry them.
00:33:47,00:33:50,"And he was then, so this is in a sort of furious letter"
00:33:50,00:33:52,"to the papers or something,"
00:33:52,00:33:54,he was then given a job by the Daily Mail
00:33:54,00:33:56,to go around beaches looking for outrageous things
00:33:56,00:33:57,to be angry about.
00:33:57,00:34:00,Some things haven't changed.
00:34:00,00:34:02,That's amazing.
00:34:02,00:34:03,Wow.
00:34:03,00:34:05,"That's so good,"
00:34:05,00:34:07,because I think the Daily Mail does employ a lot of people
00:34:07,00:34:08,"like that still today, doesn't it?"
00:34:08,00:34:10,Literally just find something to get angry about.
00:34:10,00:34:12,We need to fill our vages.
00:34:12,00:34:12,Anything.
00:34:12,00:34:18,"I was reading about a swimming hero called Gertrude Eddell,"
00:34:18,00:34:21,so she was the first woman to swim the English Channel in 1925.
00:34:21,00:34:26,"And she was trained by this guy called Jabez Wolff,"
00:34:26,00:34:27,who was a bizarre character himself.
00:34:27,00:34:29,"I don't know why she chose him to train her,"
00:34:29,00:34:33,because he'd tried and failed to swim the Channel 22 times previously.
00:34:33,00:34:38,"And despite, apparently, he employed a bagpiper for encouragement,"
00:34:38,00:34:39,and that didn't help.
00:34:39,00:34:42,"But anyway, she tried and..."
00:34:42,00:34:43,"If the bagpipers are behind you,"
00:34:43,00:34:45,then that will encourage you to swim forward.
00:34:45,00:34:49,You're trying to get as far away from Scotland as you can.
00:34:49,00:34:53,"So her first attempt, he, Jabez,"
00:34:53,00:34:55,"her trainer pulled her out of the water halfway through,"
00:34:55,00:34:58,saying that it looked like she was drowning.
00:34:58,00:34:59,And she said she wasn't drowning at all.
00:34:59,00:35:02,She'd just been having a rest face down in the water.
00:35:02,00:35:04,Eventually she did it.
00:35:04,00:35:06,"She was the sixth person ever to swim the Channel,"
00:35:06,00:35:08,and she was the fastest ever of men and women.
00:35:08,00:35:10,She did it in 14 and a half hours.
00:35:10,00:35:13,So she beat the previous person by two hours.
00:35:13,00:35:15,Did front crawl all the way.
00:35:15,00:35:18,"And the first thing, she did it from France to England."
00:35:18,00:35:21,And the first person to meet her on the beach in Kent
00:35:21,00:35:22,when she arrived was an immigration officer
00:35:22,00:35:24,who demanded to see her passport.
00:35:24,00:35:25,Amazing.
00:35:25,00:35:27,"He was actually working for the Daily Mail, wasn't he, at the time?"
00:35:27,00:35:31,Do you know what she was fed on the way?
00:35:31,00:35:33,I find this so weird.
00:35:33,00:35:35,"What she got fed, chicken legs."
00:35:35,00:35:36,I think...
00:35:36,00:35:38,"Because if they touched you in the water,"
00:35:38,00:35:39,"then that sort of, you're out."
00:35:39,00:35:41,Because you've been kind of supported by him.
00:35:41,00:35:43,"But her support boat was apparently full of chicken legs,"
00:35:43,00:35:46,"which, okay, throws someone a chicken leg in the water."
00:35:46,00:35:49,Oranges and chicken soup to sustain her as she went.
00:35:49,00:35:53,And I have no idea how she was fed the soup.
00:35:53,00:35:55,"Right. What must happen, right, is,"
00:35:55,00:35:57,"I don't want to take anything away from her swim,"
00:35:57,00:36:00,but they give her a straw to suck the soup.
00:36:00,00:36:02,And actually she's biting onto the straw
00:36:02,00:36:04,"while it's attached to the boat,"
00:36:04,00:36:05,and she's used it to pull her along.
00:36:06,00:36:09,So she's water skiing there basically.
00:36:09,00:36:10,Basically doing that.
00:36:10,00:36:13,This is a great and niche conspiracy theory
00:36:13,00:36:15,that needs to see more at.
00:36:15,00:36:19,One person who tried to swim the channel before Gertrude
00:36:19,00:36:21,"was an Australian called Annette Kellerman,"
00:36:21,00:36:24,who was probably the most famous swimmer in the world.
00:36:24,00:36:29,She was the first woman to publicly wear a one-piece swimming costume.
00:36:29,00:36:30,She was arrested on the beach.
00:36:30,00:36:31,She was one of these people who was arrested
00:36:31,00:36:36,for public indecency for wearing like a two-sexier swimming costume.
00:36:36,00:36:38,"But it wasn't really very effective,"
00:36:38,00:36:41,and she ended up releasing her own line of bathing costumes
00:36:41,00:36:44,and became massively rich because people wanted to look like her
00:36:44,00:36:45,because she was so famous.
00:36:45,00:36:48,"She was paid by the Melbourne exhibition hall to swim in,"
00:36:48,00:36:49,and it's aquarium.
00:36:49,00:36:52,So people would come and watch her swim.
00:36:52,00:36:54,"It was like you were saying about the Bordeville earlier,"
00:36:54,00:36:57,and it was like you would just go to watch her swim.
00:36:57,00:37:00,"She was like a swimming costume hero, wasn't she?"
00:37:00,00:37:03,"She was the person who brought us the swimming costume, Annette Kellerman."
00:37:03,00:37:05,"We've been pitching about the Daily Mail,"
00:37:05,00:37:09,"so for some balance, here's some perspective on the Daily Mirror."
00:37:09,00:37:11,She came between Australia and America.
00:37:11,00:37:13,"She came to the UK to do some swimming,"
00:37:13,00:37:16,"and she broke a record for swimming from Dober to Margate,"
00:37:16,00:37:19,"and she caused this huge stir, and it was all great."
00:37:19,00:37:22,And the Daily Mirror paid her to swim along that coast
00:37:22,00:37:24,every single day for two months.
00:37:24,00:37:27,"And they said to her, she was like, every day for two months?"
00:37:27,00:37:30,"Oh, God. I mean, that sounds like hell."
00:37:30,00:37:31,And they said it's a huge thing for women.
00:37:31,00:37:34,"It's going to go down as a great, successful, women kind."
00:37:34,00:37:36,"And what they actually meant was,"
00:37:36,00:37:38,"there's a lady from Australia in a swimsuit,"
00:37:38,00:37:39,"which we've never seen before here,"
00:37:39,00:37:42,and they obviously invited lots of crowds every day
00:37:42,00:37:44,to come and watch her in her swimsuit
00:37:44,00:37:46,and made loads of money selling their papers.
00:37:46,00:37:48,And it was sort of the first page three type things
00:37:48,00:37:50,were these pictures of Annette Kellerman
00:37:50,00:37:52,and people like her in swimsuits.
00:37:52,00:37:54,I've read about her show.
00:37:54,00:37:56,"She was called The Diving Venus,"
00:37:56,00:37:59,and the show ran on Broadway for four years.
00:38:00,00:38:05,And then she went to Hollywood and she starred
00:38:05,00:38:06,in a film called Daughter of the Gods.
00:38:06,00:38:09,"She did loads of films, but this was in 1916."
00:38:09,00:38:12,"And the film used 20,000 extras."
00:38:12,00:38:13,"It cost a million dollars to make,"
00:38:13,00:38:15,which was pretty unusual at the time.
00:38:15,00:38:19,"And there were scenes of her swimming nude in it,"
00:38:19,00:38:21,"I think from quite a distance,"
00:38:21,00:38:23,"but this led to the formal banning of,"
00:38:23,00:38:25,"as they were called, nude scenes in films."
00:38:25,00:38:29,"And so, yeah, it's thanks to her."
00:38:29,00:38:31,"Yeah, she did all her own stunts in that movie,"
00:38:31,00:38:33,including a 20-meter dive into the ocean
00:38:33,00:38:36,with her hands and feet tied together
00:38:36,00:38:39,and also being thrown into a pool with six crocodiles.
00:38:39,00:38:43,"Wow, it really, it sounds like a promoter Bill Sargent."
00:38:43,00:38:46,He really would have made a lot of money out of that woman.
00:38:46,00:38:49,"When she was on Broadway making all her money,"
00:38:49,00:38:53,"she made $1,250 a week on Broadway."
00:38:53,00:38:55,"And when she was doing it, there was a Harvard professor"
00:38:55,00:38:57,who said she was a perfect woman
00:38:57,00:39:00,after comparing her measurements to the Venus de Milo.
00:39:00,00:39:02,"Now, the Venus de Milo doesn't have any arms."
00:39:02,00:39:03,No.
00:39:03,00:39:07,"Useful in swimming, particularly."
00:39:07,00:39:13,"OK, it's time for our final fact of the show,"
00:39:13,00:39:15,and that is Andy.
00:39:15,00:39:17,My fact is that the film of Dr. Dolittle
00:39:17,00:39:20,was delayed for days after the giraffe being used
00:39:20,00:39:22,accidentally stepped on its own penis.
00:39:22,00:39:25,So...
00:39:26,00:39:27,How long is a giraffe's penis?
00:39:27,00:39:28,"Is it, like, a fifth leg?"
00:39:28,00:39:31,"Well, is it that before or after you've trodden on it?"
00:39:31,00:39:32,That's the question.
00:39:32,00:39:33,They have really long legs.
00:39:33,00:39:37,"I just can't work out the mechanics of this, Andy, at all."
00:39:37,00:39:38,It doesn't...
00:39:38,00:39:41,"Well, they, I mean, they're like folding deck chairs."
00:39:41,00:39:43,"You know, it's very easy to get something"
00:39:43,00:39:44,"caught in a folding deck chair,"
00:39:44,00:39:45,and I think that's the same principle.
00:39:45,00:39:48,"You need to stop going on those nudist holidays, Andy."
00:39:48,00:39:50,I can't take many more of those injuries.
00:39:50,00:39:51,I'll tell you that much.
00:39:51,00:39:54,"So, to be completely clear,"
00:39:54,00:39:57,"this is the 1967 ""Dr. Dolittle"" with Rex Harrison,"
00:39:57,00:39:59,"not the 2021 with Robert Downey Jr.,"
00:39:59,00:40:01,"where pretty much all the animals are CGI,"
00:40:01,00:40:03,and nobody stepped on anybody's penises.
00:40:03,00:40:05,And this comes from a great book called
00:40:05,00:40:08,"""Scenes from a Revolution, the Birth of the New Hollywood,"""
00:40:08,00:40:11,which is kind of an in-depth look at five films in particular.
00:40:11,00:40:15,"It's by Mark Harris, and one of those films is ""Dr. Dolittle,"""
00:40:15,00:40:18,"and there was a guy working on it called Herbert Ross,"
00:40:18,00:40:20,"who was the choreographer,"
00:40:20,00:40:21,"and he wrote to a colleague saying,"
00:40:21,00:40:25,"""We're postponed for three days, the giraffe stepped on his cock."""
00:40:25,00:40:29,"And so, it stepped on his cock, though?"
00:40:29,00:40:31,Are we misreading that?
00:40:31,00:40:33,"Yeah, stepped on Rex Harrison."
00:40:33,00:40:37,"Yeah, so that's that."
00:40:37,00:40:40,"It was pretty chaotic, wasn't it, that film?"
00:40:40,00:40:40,Sounds amazing.
00:40:40,00:40:44,"Apparently, it was revealed after it was one giraffe died,"
00:40:44,00:40:46,"and I don't think we know how, still,"
00:40:46,00:40:48,but one of the people who worked on it said one giraffe died.
00:40:48,00:40:51,"But, I mean, the general management of animals"
00:40:51,00:40:52,sounds like hell.
00:40:52,00:40:53,"It had lots of different filming locations,"
00:40:53,00:40:57,so it was partly filmed in LA and then in the Caribbean and in the UK.
00:40:57,00:40:59,"And because of quarantine laws,"
00:40:59,00:41:01,they had to hire separate sets of identical animals
00:41:01,00:41:04,for each place to play the same characters.
00:41:04,00:41:07,"And then also, the animals grow so fast"
00:41:07,00:41:09,"that they had to keep finding replacements, like doppelgangers."
00:41:09,00:41:13,"So, I think there was a pig called ""Gubgub"" in the film,"
00:41:13,00:41:16,which had 40 different piglets play at various times.
00:41:16,00:41:19,"I mean, it does seem questionable, doesn't it?"
00:41:19,00:41:21,"A lot of the sort of stuff they did to the animals,"
00:41:21,00:41:24,there was a squirrel that they had to sedate
00:41:24,00:41:25,during a scene that they needed him for.
00:41:25,00:41:28,By the sedation method they used was a fountain pen
00:41:28,00:41:32,where they dripped a gin through it to just get it drunk.
00:41:32,00:41:33,"But it ended up losing consciousness,"
00:41:33,00:41:36,because it was so drunk that they couldn't properly get the scene done.
00:41:36,00:41:37,That doesn't seem very ethical in terms of...
00:41:37,00:41:39,I think that's absolutely fine.
00:41:39,00:41:41,Elizabeth Taylor used to request that kind of thing
00:41:41,00:41:42,before she'd go over it at the camera.
00:41:42,00:41:47,There's a great story where in one scene
00:41:47,00:41:49,"that Rex Harrison was doing, he kept..."
00:41:49,00:41:52,This is the story that he kept stopping the scene
00:41:52,00:41:53,"and the director's going, ""What are you doing?"""
00:41:53,00:41:55,"And he goes, ""Well, you keep calling cut."""
00:41:55,00:41:58,"He's going, ""I'm not calling cut, you're definitely calling cut."""
00:41:58,00:42:01,And they worked out that it was the parrot that was in the scene
00:42:01,00:42:03,"that's going to mimic the word ""cut."""
00:42:03,00:42:04,No way.
00:42:04,00:42:07,"Yeah, and Rex was getting confused."
00:42:07,00:42:09,"So, they built a set for the house of Dr. Doolittle."
00:42:09,00:42:12,Whose whole stake is that he can talk to the animals.
00:42:12,00:42:13,"So, he lives with a load of animals."
00:42:13,00:42:18,"But the whole house, the set had to be built on a slant"
00:42:18,00:42:20,because obviously the animals are pooing everywhere
00:42:20,00:42:22,and peeing everywhere.
00:42:22,00:42:24,"So, they had lots of people in the crew"
00:42:24,00:42:27,just standing around with brooms waiting for when that happened.
00:42:27,00:42:30,All the furniture had to be either plastic or painted
00:42:30,00:42:33,so that it could be hosed down at the end of each day
00:42:33,00:42:34,filming in this set house.
00:42:34,00:42:36,They had to have double the sets
00:42:36,00:42:38,because frequently animals would just kick a hole
00:42:38,00:42:40,in the walls or the furniture.
00:42:41,00:42:43,The trainers got hepatitis from being bitten.
00:42:43,00:42:47,"I read one amazing sentence in the link you sent, Andy,"
00:42:47,00:42:50,"which is, ""Unfathomably, the ducks in the pond"
00:42:50,00:42:53,"""appeared to forget how to swim and started to sink."""
00:42:53,00:42:57,You know you're having a bad time.
00:42:57,00:42:59,You think you'd be able to rely on the ducks
00:42:59,00:43:00,to be able to swim.
00:43:00,00:43:01,So funny.
00:43:01,00:43:03,But apparently what had happened was
00:43:03,00:43:05,"it was the wrong time of year,"
00:43:05,00:43:08,so they'd lost all their waterproof sheen on their feathers.
00:43:08,00:43:09,"And at that time of year,"
00:43:09,00:43:11,ducks don't normally swim or something.
00:43:11,00:43:12,And so they all just started sinking.
00:43:12,00:43:13,"Yeah, I found that amazing."
00:43:13,00:43:15,I didn't know that.
00:43:15,00:43:16,Didn't know that ever happened.
00:43:16,00:43:17,Incredible.
00:43:17,00:43:18,Has anyone seen the movie?
00:43:18,00:43:20,"Years ago as a kid, yeah."
00:43:20,00:43:21,Really? Was that any good?
00:43:21,00:43:23,"Yeah, I mean as a kid it was one of those"
00:43:23,00:43:24,Sunday afternoon movies.
00:43:24,00:43:26,"And I do remember loving it,"
00:43:26,00:43:28,but I've read a lot of things
00:43:28,00:43:29,that suggest that I'm completely wrong about that.
00:43:29,00:43:31,It has a very low rating.
00:43:31,00:43:34,"It got the best-pitched Oscar nomination,"
00:43:34,00:43:37,but it's the lowest-rated score on Rotten Tomatoes
00:43:37,00:43:38,ever to get a nomination.
00:43:39,00:43:41,"Ooh, what's it rocking on Rotten?"
00:43:41,00:43:42,32%.
00:43:42,00:43:45,"Rex Harrison, who was the star of it,"
00:43:45,00:43:47,was so horrible to everyone
00:43:47,00:43:49,"that he was nicknamed Tyrannosaurus Rex,"
00:43:49,00:43:51,which is very clever when you think
00:43:51,00:43:53,because it's a film about animals that are talking.
00:43:53,00:43:54,Yes.
00:43:54,00:43:56,He had a good reputation for behaving like that
00:43:56,00:43:58,"quite frequently, didn't he, Rex Harrison?"
00:43:58,00:43:59,He was grumpy bastard.
00:43:59,00:44:00,"Or a character,"
00:44:00,00:44:02,depending on which way you want to frame it.
00:44:02,00:44:04,"But I should say,"
00:44:04,00:44:05,so I'm a huge My Fair Lady fan
00:44:05,00:44:07,and a big Rex Harrison fan in that.
00:44:07,00:44:09,"And there's a guy called Will Harrison,"
00:44:09,00:44:12,"who's his grandson, who listens to the podcast."
00:44:12,00:44:15,"So we have inside Rex Harrison info,"
00:44:15,00:44:16,"apparently on,"
00:44:16,00:44:18,"if you look at the film poster of Cleopatra,"
00:44:18,00:44:20,who was supposed to just have Richard Burton
00:44:20,00:44:22,and Elizabeth Taylor on it as Anthony and Cleopatra.
00:44:22,00:44:23,OK.
00:44:23,00:44:25,"But Rex was like, I'm the big star here, guys."
00:44:25,00:44:26,What the hell are you doing?
00:44:26,00:44:27,Get me on the poster.
00:44:27,00:44:29,"And so you see just behind them,"
00:44:29,00:44:31,"Juliet Caesar, Rex Harrison staring"
00:44:31,00:44:33,really creepily down at this loving couple.
00:44:33,00:44:35,And he was always doing stuff like that.
00:44:35,00:44:37,There's one particularly famous anecdote
00:44:37,00:44:40,which is that he'd performed in the theater
00:44:40,00:44:43,and there was an autograph hunter waiting outside.
00:44:43,00:44:45,She had her book ready for him to sign.
00:44:45,00:44:47,"He came out, she asked for the autograph"
00:44:47,00:44:49,"and he said, ""Sod off."""
00:44:49,00:44:50,"And what she did was,"
00:44:50,00:44:51,"she rolled up the program,"
00:44:51,00:44:54,she wanted him to sign and she hit him with it.
00:44:54,00:44:56,"And the co-star of the play, Stanley Holloway,"
00:44:56,00:45:00,later said that it was a rare but welcome case
00:45:00,00:45:02,of the fan hitting the shit.
00:45:02,00:45:06,That's how they viewed him.
00:45:06,00:45:08,"You know Christopher Plummer, the actor?"
00:45:08,00:45:09,Yes.
00:45:09,00:45:11,"He has a sound of music and stuff, I guess."
00:45:11,00:45:14,"He was paid $300,000 not to be in ""Doctor Do Little."""
00:45:14,00:45:15,Really?
00:45:15,00:45:20,"Which is such an epic fail by the accountants, I think."
00:45:20,00:45:22,"So basically, Harrison temporarily quit the project."
00:45:22,00:45:25,He decided he wasn't completely up for it.
00:45:25,00:45:26,"And then so they said,"
00:45:26,00:45:28,"""Well, who do we get? We need some Hollywood giant."""
00:45:28,00:45:29,"So they got Christopher Plummer,"
00:45:29,00:45:32,"signed him up for $300,000."
00:45:32,00:45:33,"And then Harrison said,"
00:45:33,00:45:35,"""Oh, fine, I will do the film then."""
00:45:35,00:45:36,"So Plummer never filmed a scene,"
00:45:36,00:45:38,"never said a line of the dialogue,"
00:45:38,00:45:40,but still got paid his full fee for it.
00:45:40,00:45:41,It's the dream job.
00:45:41,00:45:42,It's the dream job.
00:45:42,00:45:45,It was originally written by a woman called Helen Winston.
00:45:45,00:45:47,And they rewrote it.
00:45:47,00:45:49,They just completely rewrote the thing.
00:45:49,00:45:52,"Apart from, they used loads of her stuff,"
00:45:52,00:45:54,but then didn't tell her she was going to use it.
00:45:54,00:45:56,And so she sued them and she got
00:45:56,00:45:58,£3.2 million out of them for that.
00:45:58,00:45:59,Whoa!
00:45:59,00:46:03,And it lost £9 million in the box office.
00:46:03,00:46:07,So a third of that was just due to stealing this woman's work.
00:46:07,00:46:09,"So actually, the two people in it"
00:46:09,00:46:11,"who had their work stolen from them,"
00:46:11,00:46:13,"Christopher Plummer and this lady,"
00:46:13,00:46:15,sounds like they were the real winners here.
00:46:15,00:46:19,So Dr. Dolittle is incredibly loosely based
00:46:19,00:46:22,on a series of stories written by Hugh Lofting
00:46:22,00:46:26,in the 1920s and during the First World War.
00:46:26,00:46:27,And they bear no resemblance.
00:46:27,00:46:28,"I don't think the plots,"
00:46:28,00:46:30,"but any resemblance to the stories he originally wrote,"
00:46:30,00:46:32,but they are about a doctor who talks to animals.
00:46:32,00:46:34,And it's quite a sweet story.
00:46:34,00:46:36,So I hadn't realised he wrote them
00:46:36,00:46:38,"while he was fighting in the trenches in World War I,"
00:46:38,00:46:41,and he was writing letters back to his children.
00:46:41,00:46:43,"And he understandably thought,"
00:46:43,00:46:44,"""I'm not sure I want to tell the kids"
00:46:44,00:46:46,"about my trenches-based experience."""
00:46:46,00:46:49,"And so instead, he wrote these brilliant stories"
00:46:49,00:46:50,about a guy who talks to animals.
00:46:50,00:46:53,He was a real crusader for animal rights in lots of ways.
00:46:53,00:46:55,"And he once beat up three men,"
00:46:55,00:46:56,"including one who had a knife,"
00:46:56,00:46:58,because they were trying to tame some wild horses.
00:46:58,00:47:00,"And they were, I think,"
00:47:00,00:47:02,not being especially pleasant to the horses.
00:47:02,00:47:03,"So, yeah."
00:47:03,00:47:07,"Yeah, he was very strong on sympathising with animals."
00:47:07,00:47:09,He was shocked by how horses were treated.
00:47:09,00:47:12,They did have a very bad time in the First World War.
00:47:12,00:47:15,"Yeah, it was the way that he saw horses being treated."
00:47:15,00:47:18,And they needed to be looked after by vets.
00:47:18,00:47:18,"But he was like,"
00:47:18,00:47:21,"""Well, they can't really tell us what's wrong with them"
00:47:21,00:47:22,"because they're horses."""
00:47:22,00:47:24,And that was kind of what gave him the idea
00:47:24,00:47:25,"of writing ""Doctor Do Little."""
00:47:25,00:47:28,"But we should say that if you have read ""Doctor Do Little"""
00:47:28,00:47:31,"in the last 20 or 30 years,"
00:47:31,00:47:34,"you're probably reading a massively sanitised version of it,"
00:47:34,00:47:37,because the original is extremely racist.
00:47:37,00:47:42,"So, in 1968, there was a librarian called Isabelle Sewell,"
00:47:42,00:47:45,"who wrote an essay about a few different books,"
00:47:45,00:47:47,"but specifically about ""Doctor Do Little,"""
00:47:47,00:47:51,"who described you lofting as a white, racist, and chauvinist,"
00:47:51,00:47:55,"guilty of almost every prejudice known to modern white, western man."
00:47:55,00:47:56,And that was in the '60s.
00:47:56,00:47:58,"So, yeah, exactly."
00:47:58,00:48:00,"And so, basically, from then on,"
00:48:00,00:48:02,"he just got pretty much cancelled,"
00:48:02,00:48:06,and really all his books went out-print for quite a long time
00:48:06,00:48:11,until they got rewritten with a lot of the racist bits taken out.
00:48:11,00:48:13,"Yeah, with no resemblance to the originals, basically."
00:48:13,00:48:16,"But on the other hand, loved horses."
00:48:16,00:48:18,"Yeah, I mean, anti-war and pro-animal, for sure."
00:48:18,00:48:20,"Yeah, yeah."
00:48:20,00:48:24,"So, I've been looking a bit into talking to animals,"
00:48:25,00:48:28,"and people are doing serious work on this right now,"
00:48:28,00:48:29,and it's really cool.
00:48:29,00:48:31,"So, there is a new device,"
00:48:31,00:48:35,which is trying to train basically Lassie technology.
00:48:35,00:48:38,"So, the idea is that dogs will have a vest,"
00:48:38,00:48:40,"and if the person needs help,"
00:48:40,00:48:42,"they can pull a tab to communicate a message, okay?"
00:48:42,00:48:46,"So, it might be someone's fallen down a well,"
00:48:46,00:48:47,"but that's probably not going to be it,"
00:48:47,00:48:50,because it's only one message on the tab that they can pull.
00:48:51,00:48:55,"So, for example, lots of children with autism"
00:48:55,00:48:58,"find it very helpful and calming to have a dog,"
00:48:58,00:49:02,"and if they are panicking or upset,"
00:49:02,00:49:03,it might be possible to train the dog
00:49:03,00:49:06,"to pull the tab on its little vest,"
00:49:06,00:49:08,"because it can spot the size that its owner is upset,"
00:49:08,00:49:11,"and then that will read out the dog saying,"
00:49:11,00:49:12,"""Could you please pet me now?"""
00:49:12,00:49:15,"And then therefore, the child will pet the dog,"
00:49:15,00:49:17,and we'll calm down and that will help.
00:49:17,00:49:19,"So, they're trying to see if they can train dogs"
00:49:19,00:49:21,"to have several different messages,"
00:49:21,00:49:22,or if they can train it.
00:49:22,00:49:23,"So, either could you pet me now,"
00:49:23,00:49:26,"or someone's fallen down a well, or whatever it might be."
00:49:26,00:49:29,It's just those two they've coded in on the internet.
00:49:29,00:49:34,"Wait, so the dog senses that the child is anxious,"
00:49:34,00:49:36,"and so then pulls the tab that says, ""Can you pet me?"""
00:49:36,00:49:39,"So, the child signals they're anxious without realizing it,"
00:49:39,00:49:41,and then the dog does something to make the child calm down.
00:49:41,00:49:43,"Yeah, exactly, yeah, yeah."
00:49:43,00:49:44,"Yeah, well, you might be anxious,"
00:49:44,00:49:46,because the dog's just told you that someone's fallen down a well.
00:49:48,00:49:50,I really wish I hadn't mentioned this well thing.
00:49:50,00:49:52,Complete red herring.
00:49:52,00:49:53,Do you know that...
00:49:53,00:49:55,"I was going to do this as a fact in a future week,"
00:49:55,00:49:58,but do you know that the traditional way of preparing melon
00:49:58,00:50:00,in France was to put it down a well for four hours?
00:50:00,00:50:02,Melon?
00:50:02,00:50:02,"A melon, yeah."
00:50:02,00:50:03,Because before...
00:50:03,00:50:06,"What, and it came up perfectly sliced, I'm sure."
00:50:06,00:50:08,Who lived down that well?
00:50:08,00:50:12,A small child who fell there many years ago.
00:50:12,00:50:13,"No, they are..."
00:50:13,00:50:17,"Basically, you wanted your melon to be nice and cold, right?"
00:50:17,00:50:19,"And they had no refrigeration, but they did have a well,"
00:50:19,00:50:21,which was cold at the bottom.
00:50:21,00:50:23,"So, they used to traditionally, in France,"
00:50:23,00:50:25,"they would put their melon in the well a few hours before,"
00:50:25,00:50:28,"and then bring it up, and it's nice and cold."
00:50:28,00:50:30,"So, the dog would, in this case, have a third tab,"
00:50:30,00:50:32,"which says, ""Your melon is ready, sir."""
00:50:32,00:50:38,"That was in an article written by B Wilson that I read the other day,"
00:50:38,00:50:39,which is pretty amazing.
00:50:39,00:50:43,"Artificial intelligence might help us to talk to animals,"
00:50:43,00:50:44,or to understand what they're thinking.
00:50:45,00:50:48,"There is a scientist called Dr. Krista McLennan,"
00:50:48,00:50:53,who is working on a way of using AI to tell you what sheep are thinking.
00:50:53,00:50:57,"And apparently, it's really hard for farmers to tell what a sheep is thinking,"
00:50:57,00:50:59,just by looking at its face.
00:50:59,00:51:02,Because they don't have much expression on their faces.
00:51:02,00:51:05,"You often see farmers kneeling down,"
00:51:05,00:51:07,"just staring deep into a sheep's eyes, don't you?"
00:51:07,00:51:09,"Going, ""Why can't I tell?"""
00:51:09,00:51:11,"I mean, I believe this."
00:51:11,00:51:14,"So, I was reading this article about this AI algorithm"
00:51:14,00:51:17,that tells you whether a sheep's happy or not happy.
00:51:17,00:51:18,And there's part of it.
00:51:18,00:51:23,"On NBC, they had a quiz where they would show you pictures of sheep,"
00:51:23,00:51:25,and you had to guess whether they were happy or sad.
00:51:25,00:51:30,"I only got one out of four, and that was a lucky guess,"
00:51:30,00:51:32,"because I just had three sad sheep in a row,"
00:51:32,00:51:34,and I thought the fourth one must be a happy.
00:51:34,00:51:35,That's games for a show.
00:51:35,00:51:36,I did that same quiz.
00:51:36,00:51:38,I got three.
00:51:38,00:51:40,"So, I'm a sheep whisperer, basically."
00:51:42,00:51:44,"I didn't. It's quite specific, isn't it, though?"
00:51:44,00:51:45,It is tricky.
00:51:45,00:51:50,"So, the signs of pain or emotional suffering in a sheep are"
00:51:50,00:51:51,"narrow eyes, tight cheeks."
00:51:51,00:51:54,"Oh, hold on. I don't know if I really want to do the test."
00:51:54,00:51:54,Yeah.
00:51:54,00:51:55,Okay.
00:51:55,00:51:56,Don't tell us your facts.
00:51:56,00:51:59,"Anna, tell me the symptoms before you do the test,"
00:51:59,00:52:00,is what the test is based on.
00:52:00,00:52:00,That's the thing.
00:52:00,00:52:05,"They say if it has a nostril shape like a V rather than a U,"
00:52:05,00:52:06,then it's either happy or sad.
