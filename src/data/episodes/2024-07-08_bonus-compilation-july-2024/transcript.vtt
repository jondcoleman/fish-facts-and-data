00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:35.900
 compilation it's just the four of us this week me Andy James and Anna hope you

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:38.980
 enjoy here we go

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:56.660
 my fact is that in some American states in the late 1980s children could be sent

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:00.900
 sorry I just got the giggles from the last bit

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:05.500
 my fact is that in some American states in the late 1980s children could be sent

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:14.260
 to prison. Why children being sent to prison is rarely such a comical item. Why is that so funny Andy? I would say it's a bit of a sat-in

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:29.900
 indictment of American society because these children are sent to prison. I've been to

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:35.840
 Lynchburg Tennessee which you know the Jack Daniels factory sorry it's not a

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:42.220
 Jack Daniels factory they don't call it the factory what do they call it but

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:45.280
 that's dry and you're allowed to buy the whiskey there but I don't think you're

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:49.060
 allowed to open it. Did you go to the distillery itself? Yeah yeah yeah oh we

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:52.260
 had a tour it was so interesting. Is it true I think they say this that Jack

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:57.380
 Daniels died when he kicked a barrel and got sepsis on his foot. I always can ask that as well did you learn that from a tube

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:00.820
 poster in the London Underground? No I already knew it but then I saw it on the

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:04.300
 tube poster and I thought oh it must be true. Yeah exactly one of those incredibly

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:07.580
 nostalgic adverts in London I don't know if they do this in America but

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:11.900
 basically all the Jack Daniels adverts are old Mr. Jack because everybody used

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:15.980
 to call him and he would have this funny thing he'd say and they have such a

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:18.340
 sucker for them they really work on me despite the fact I do not think Jack

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:23.980
 Daniels tastes nice. Yeah I mean he's gone to the distillery. I know you were just on the

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:27.420
 tube you were gonna get the Northern line that's a Monnington Crescent you're

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:31.380
 like you know what I feel like going all the way to Lynchburg County. I turned around

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:38.980
 on the big Italy line went to Heathrow. Can I tell you the best named Flight

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:43.820
 Attendant I found? Gone. This is in 1956 there was I think a beauty competition

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:48.340
 because it was the 50s for Flight Attendants or Miss Skyway. Anyway the

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:52.580
 winner I can't believe this she was a 22 year old hostess and her name was Muffet

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:58.940
 Webb. Wow. Little Miss Muffet. Wait but those were the days when Flight Attendants

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:03.420
 had to give themselves sort of porn names. But actually remember last week we

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:08.260
 established that the word Muff is a man's name so Muffet doesn't make sense

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:11.900
 that that might be a female name. Yeah I just think what are the odds of being

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:14.900
 called Webb as your surname which a spider makes and then your first name

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:18.700
 being Muffet. Little Miss Muffet famously encounters the spider. So do you think the

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:23.340
 parents were told that I went oh we never noticed. I think maybe. I think it's a

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:26.460
 loose enough connection you have to go all the way through that rhyme to get to

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:29.260
 the spider bit. Disagree it was the first thing I thought of. Yeah. I thought my

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:32.860
 crazy name. But you do recite that 20 times a day don't you when you're cleaning

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:38.740
 your teeth. Used to be quite strange being interviewed to be a Flight

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:41.140
 Attendant. There was a piece which interviewed lots of people who've been

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:45.060
 Flight Attendants in the 50s, 60s and 70s and they recalled things they've been

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:48.660
 asked. One of them in fact who was working for a European airline in the

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:51.780
 1960s said that in her interview she was asked to name the Prime Minister of

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:56.420
 Malta which is weird. Oh gosh I don't think I could do that. No. No well we

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:59.420
 would all fail the Flight Attendant. Would she be interviewed for a gig that went

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:03.180
 to Malta? Among others it was just I think it went all over Europe. Oh that is

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:06.180
 impressive. Yeah it is. She said she'd just seen a TV show on him the day

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:12.420
 before which helped. Suggests that he was more famous whenever this positive

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:16.540
 quiz was coming up. 1969 he was the most famous person in the world. Broadcasting

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:20.900
 has changed hasn't it. You don't get that level of detail these days. No. Though in

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:24.020
 the 1960s one of them recalled that continental airlines you had to have a

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:27.860
 full pelvic exam to make sure you weren't pregnant and nor had you had

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:31.140
 children. Wow. Because I think we've mentioned before you weren't allowed to

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:36.020
 have had children. You had to be a single woman. How invasive do you have to

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:39.620
 get to tell if someone has had a child? Yeah I don't know how they could tell

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:44.180
 actually. That feels like a difficult thing to judge. It does but I'm sure

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:47.780
 every interviewer was perfectly well trained and qualified to respectfully

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:52.620
 perform the pelvic exam before asking you know what are your greatest strengths.

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:56.620
 My pelvic floor.

00:05:56.620 --> 00:06:01.820
 I find the story like the old medical uses of leeches you read how the blood

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:04.620
 letting happens but there's one that I'd never heard of which just sounds

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:08.700
 terrifying which is to do tonsillitis treatment which is that you would

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:12.940
 strap a rope or a little string around your leech and you would lower it down

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:17.900
 your throat like Tom Cruise and Mission Impossible sort of slowly not touching

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:20.780
 anything making sure not to set anything off and then boom onto the

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:26.380
 tonsils and that just sounds agony. But they would put on people's bottoms on a

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:31.820
 on a leash as well. Yeah. You'd have. Leech on a leash. That's it.

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:37.100
 Crumbs as well. Crumbs.

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:41.340
 Searched in Dublin called Jonathan Osbourne in the 1830s he said if you got

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:45.100
 inflamed intestines well I've got a new

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:49.340
 collar arrangement for a leech and I'll just send one on up there

00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:52.460
 and he said I've never used more than four leeches at once.

00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:56.940
 Upper bum. I believe so I'm afraid. Yeah quite right there.

00:06:56.940 --> 00:07:00.540
 Well they're very adventurous apparently which is why they needed the leash

00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:03.500
 because they would want to go into lots of orifices and would try if you put them

00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:05.500
 in one bit the body they'll try to get to another.

00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:08.700
 I'm not surprised. I don't think they can be tamed leeches.

00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:11.580
 Well people have kept them as pets though. Have they?

00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:15.020
 In the past. I was reading about one guy the Lord Chancellor I think in the

00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:21.340
 early 19th century. He did life was saved by a leech so he

00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:26.540
 thought two leeches who bled him and so he kept them as pets. But he didn't take

00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:31.020
 them for like walks in large parks did he? Not only in small parks because they

00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:36.140
 don't need big walks leeches like Greyhounds.

00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:39.820
 You used to rent them because they were so expensive because they were used so

00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:42.860
 much they were driven to basically extinction in Western Europe and you'd

00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:47.340
 have a leech in your shop window all dressed up to look fine.

00:07:47.340 --> 00:07:50.940
 But they would like decorate them but they would need amazing bodice

00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:53.420
 play boxes. Like a sex worker in Amsterdam.

00:07:53.420 --> 00:08:00.540
 Like that yes and in the same way they weren't one use only.

00:08:00.540 --> 00:08:04.380
 But the trade was mega. The leech trade across Europe was massive because

00:08:04.380 --> 00:08:07.820
 in the UK they started running low but there was big demand so there were

00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:11.100
 wetlands and they were transported by sea they were

00:08:11.100 --> 00:08:14.140
 kept in portable swamps. Countries would raid each other's

00:08:14.140 --> 00:08:17.580
 leech farms. Come on. No it's true. It's all 100 years

00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:21.020
 well started isn't it. There was smuggling. Leech smuggling. The

00:08:21.020 --> 00:08:26.860
 Germans built large leech parks. Oh yeah where did they smuggle them?

00:08:26.860 --> 00:08:30.700
 No more than four that time.

00:08:30.700 --> 00:08:35.260
 America used to have a group of citizen vigilantes who could bust into your

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:37.740
 home and see if you had too many cans of food.

00:08:37.740 --> 00:08:42.860
 Really? Yeah. This is insane. The Harvest Festival squad. It kind of is.

00:08:42.860 --> 00:08:48.060
 So this is first world war. There was some rationing on in America

00:08:48.060 --> 00:08:52.140
 1918 and the group was called the American Protective League

00:08:52.140 --> 00:08:55.420
 and they started off with quite grandiose aims. We're going to catch foreign

00:08:55.420 --> 00:08:58.700
 spies in America and then they quickly added to their brief.

00:08:58.700 --> 00:09:01.580
 And one of the briefs was finding food hoarders.

00:09:01.580 --> 00:09:04.540
 People who'd been you know busting the rationing rules.

00:09:04.540 --> 00:09:07.660
 Citizen groups could legally enter other people's homes and just check if they

00:09:07.660 --> 00:09:11.420
 had been hoarding food. No way. Yeah and they had badges and

00:09:11.420 --> 00:09:14.300
 ranks and I think they were eventually disbanded because people said

00:09:14.300 --> 00:09:17.660
 not sure we want this especially now that the war's over.

00:09:17.660 --> 00:09:21.180
 So yeah that was the thing. You don't like that guy do you?

00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:25.980
 Barry comes over wearing his badge. Looking in your pantry.

00:09:25.980 --> 00:09:30.940
 Sod off mate. I got that was there. People in the USA love carrying their own food.

00:09:30.940 --> 00:09:35.260
 It's a big trend. What you buy fresh sardines and then you count them at home.

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:38.460
 Your own produce. Your own produce. Yeah yeah if you grow tomatoes or whatever.

00:09:38.460 --> 00:09:41.260
 Yeah and there are there are all these different groups. There are some people

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:44.380
 are doing it for preppy reasons. Some people who are kind of you know just

00:09:44.380 --> 00:09:48.380
 want to eat eco and all of this and there are home canning machines much like

00:09:48.380 --> 00:09:51.660
 James's Electric can open up probably. The opposite really?

00:09:51.660 --> 00:09:55.020
 Yeah that's exactly the opposite. Yeah whatever. Okay move on.

00:09:55.020 --> 00:09:58.540
 There are rebel counters who claim that government food safety guidelines are

00:09:58.540 --> 00:10:03.980
 basically just state overreach. Yeah there's a thriving ecosystem.

00:10:03.980 --> 00:10:06.780
 So what are they doing when they claim that that's overreach? Do they say that

00:10:06.780 --> 00:10:10.060
 we'll can this and keep it for longer than the government says?

00:10:10.060 --> 00:10:12.540
 Or are you not technically allowed to home can maybe?

00:10:12.540 --> 00:10:15.340
 No you are technically allowed to do it. So what's rebellious about the rebel

00:10:15.340 --> 00:10:17.500
 canners? I think they just ignore government food

00:10:17.500 --> 00:10:24.780
 safety guidelines. Oh yeah. Good on them. Fighting the good fight.

00:10:24.780 --> 00:10:28.220
 William Wordsworth wrote a poem about leeches once. Did he? Yeah it's called

00:10:28.220 --> 00:10:32.540
 The Leech Gatherer. I wandered lonely as a leech.

00:10:32.540 --> 00:10:37.180
 Can I read you a few lines? Yes please. Okay. From pond to pond he roamed

00:10:37.180 --> 00:10:39.740
 gathering leeches far and wide he travelled

00:10:39.740 --> 00:10:43.580
 stirring thus about his feet the waters of the pool where they abide

00:10:43.580 --> 00:10:48.140
 and then open quote marks once I could meet with them on every side

00:10:48.140 --> 00:10:53.180
 but they have dwindled long by slow decay yet still I persevere and find them

00:10:53.180 --> 00:10:56.220
 where I may. So he's writing about the decline

00:10:56.220 --> 00:10:59.980
 of the English leech gatherer because all the leeches have been

00:10:59.980 --> 00:11:03.100
 used up for medicine. Sorry where's where did the quote marks

00:11:03.100 --> 00:11:09.980
 quote marks close? Still I'm still going, excuse me.

00:11:09.980 --> 00:11:15.100
 Does his poem includes Dan's outro as well?

00:11:15.100 --> 00:11:19.660
 Wordsworth. What a thinker. Yeah but he's sort of writing about changing

00:11:19.660 --> 00:11:24.220
 industrial conditions for leech. Yeah. You know working yeah yeah.

00:11:24.220 --> 00:11:28.220
 And there was an anarchist community in the late 19th century

00:11:28.220 --> 00:11:33.180
 in America called the Mutual Home Colony Association.

00:11:33.180 --> 00:11:36.940
 Things were going really well no one's in charge they're all growing their own

00:11:36.940 --> 00:11:40.700
 food doing all this kind of stuff but then some of the anarchists

00:11:40.700 --> 00:11:44.700
 wanted to go skinny dipping and wear no clothes

00:11:44.700 --> 00:11:48.300
 and some of them thought well actually this is the clothes part

00:11:48.300 --> 00:11:52.700
 of society I kind of like that part and so there was a big argument

00:11:52.700 --> 00:11:56.700
 and nudity was illegal in that part of America and so the people who

00:11:56.700 --> 00:11:59.740
 didn't like nudity didn't like the skinny dipping

00:11:59.740 --> 00:12:03.900
 went to the police outside of the community and said look there's some

00:12:03.900 --> 00:12:07.180
 naked people here and then the police came in and arrested them

00:12:07.180 --> 00:12:10.940
 and this obviously went off just went completely off.

00:12:10.940 --> 00:12:15.020
 It was known in the press as the nudes versus the prudes.

00:12:15.020 --> 00:12:19.180
 Brilliant. One of the prudes had a shop and the nudes

00:12:19.180 --> 00:12:24.140
 refused to shop there. The nudes refused to speak to the prudes

00:12:24.140 --> 00:12:28.300
 and the prudes retaliated with violence and physically assaulted the nudes in

00:12:28.300 --> 00:12:32.780
 the street. Okay I know who's siding on. Who's siding on the nudes?

00:12:32.780 --> 00:12:35.260
 If you're not speaking to someone you don't deserve them to come and punch you

00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:38.380
 in the face. No I think it was the earlier

00:12:38.380 --> 00:12:42.860
 problems you know that led to that. I mean that's where it escalated to.

00:12:42.860 --> 00:12:45.660
 But yeah. I think the prudes going and getting the police from outside that's

00:12:45.660 --> 00:12:49.820
 a bit like why have you told on me? Yeah if you're an anarchist you

00:12:49.820 --> 00:12:53.900
 should be able to solve this within your own. Yeah I believe they tried that.

00:12:53.900 --> 00:12:57.420
 I really. They did try to say put some clothes on please.

00:12:57.420 --> 00:13:01.020
 It's very hard. My children are here. Yeah if you're in a legal society and

00:13:01.020 --> 00:13:03.420
 someone insists on taking all their clothes off I don't know what you

00:13:03.420 --> 00:13:06.460
 could do. Yeah it's funny how often the clothes come off

00:13:06.460 --> 00:13:09.340
 in these societies isn't it? It just always ends up there.

00:13:09.340 --> 00:13:12.220
 So how is that related to this? There was a famous one I can't remember

00:13:12.220 --> 00:13:16.220
 but it's called that Louisa May Olcott grew up in. She grew up in like one of

00:13:16.220 --> 00:13:19.740
 these communities. The original little woman? Yeah yeah yeah and I wish I could

00:13:19.740 --> 00:13:23.340
 remember this but again there was like one person

00:13:23.340 --> 00:13:27.900
 who went around with no clothes on. One person who kind of swore all the time

00:13:27.900 --> 00:13:31.340
 and just was like okay well I'm an anarchist community I'm just gonna swear

00:13:31.340 --> 00:13:35.100
 because you can't do anything. That's so Joe.

00:13:35.100 --> 00:13:38.460
 I think there was one person who would say everything backwards

00:13:38.460 --> 00:13:42.860
 or something. Can't think of which of the sisters that's like no.

00:13:42.860 --> 00:13:47.420
 They're like well you know I'm not part of America anymore. I can speak backwards

00:13:47.420 --> 00:13:50.300
 if I want. Wow. It's like if you're in an anarchist

00:13:50.300 --> 00:13:53.660
 community what would you what would you do? Like what is

00:13:53.660 --> 00:13:56.700
 what are you not doing because the man is stopping you from doing it?

00:13:56.700 --> 00:14:00.700
 Oh gosh that's a good that's a great question. I mean you know my answers

00:14:00.700 --> 00:14:04.300
 are all going to be punishingly boring.

00:14:04.300 --> 00:14:07.180
 I'm not thatching at the moment because but I don't feel like I'm being stopped by

00:14:07.180 --> 00:14:11.820
 the man really.

00:14:11.820 --> 00:14:15.980
 I've never honked my horn in my life in a angry way because whenever something

00:14:15.980 --> 00:14:19.580
 happens on the road I assume it's my fault. Anna always does it when she's

00:14:19.580 --> 00:14:22.380
 happiest. I do it. I do a hello honk and you

00:14:22.380 --> 00:14:24.620
 know there's that horrible thing where you're like how do I make this honk to

00:14:24.620 --> 00:14:27.260
 my friend who I'm passing by for instance sound like a hello

00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:29.660
 rather than an angry and you've got to do a bit of a

00:14:29.660 --> 00:14:34.700
 boop boop boop. But your car does go ho ho ho.

00:14:34.700 --> 00:14:40.140
 And it falls apart whenever you get to your destination.

00:14:40.140 --> 00:14:43.740
 Do you know those are illegal in Cambodia? That particular one I just sang.

00:14:43.740 --> 00:14:47.180
 Any. Any musical honks. Any musical horns.

00:14:47.180 --> 00:14:50.700
 Is it because people honk so much? It is but also I think apparently there's a

00:14:50.700 --> 00:14:54.860
 problem with people dancing to them. Right. That doesn't sound like a problem to me.

00:14:54.860 --> 00:15:00.300
 Well you want to be in penom pen in rush hour.

00:15:00.300 --> 00:15:03.180
 I wonder when you were saying that the birds land down on the ship it suddenly

00:15:03.180 --> 00:15:05.900
 made me think okay migrating birds what a great way for

00:15:05.900 --> 00:15:09.420
 navigational tools on a on a ship. If you had a migrating birds

00:15:09.420 --> 00:15:13.180
 anytime you let it go followed where it was flying off for a bit and then

00:15:13.180 --> 00:15:16.700
 manage to bring it back in. Is that what they did? That's so interesting.

00:15:16.700 --> 00:15:20.060
 Noah's honk. Noah's honk? Did Noah do that? Yeah.

00:15:20.060 --> 00:15:25.100
 Yeah. To where? Where's he really going? He releases the dove

00:15:25.100 --> 00:15:29.260
 and it comes back with an olive in its beak. Not an olive. Come on it wasn't

00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:35.500
 18 olive. And it's holding a martini in its claws.

00:15:35.500 --> 00:15:38.940
 Sorry, an olive branch. And he's like, ah, there'll be land.

00:15:38.940 --> 00:15:44.380
 You know that's and then. It was from Devon, wasn't it?

00:15:44.380 --> 00:15:48.140
 Um I found one as well which is do you know that New Zealand has a coat of

00:15:48.140 --> 00:15:51.420
 arms? I'd actually never seen it before but as a coat of arms and there are

00:15:51.420 --> 00:15:54.300
 people on it. Oh. There's a there's a woman on it.

00:15:54.300 --> 00:15:58.140
 And the woman is Grace Kelly the actor. Yeah.

00:15:58.140 --> 00:16:01.900
 Is she New Zealander? No she's not but in 1949

00:16:01.900 --> 00:16:05.340
 there was an election of the first national government and the new

00:16:05.340 --> 00:16:08.700
 attorney general who was called Jack Marshall who later became prime minister

00:16:08.700 --> 00:16:12.940
 he had the responsibility of running the committee for the coat of arms

00:16:12.940 --> 00:16:16.620
 and he asked for the woman to be redrawn based on the likeness of Grace Kelly

00:16:16.620 --> 00:16:21.260
 because that was his favorite actress. Oh really? Yeah. So she's on forever now.

00:16:21.260 --> 00:16:23.980
 New Zealand has Grace Kelly on it. Yeah.

00:16:23.980 --> 00:16:28.140
 It's weird isn't it? Yeah. It's weird. It's weird seeing this thing because

00:16:28.140 --> 00:16:32.140
 you get a lot of like with these statues of generic female statues which are

00:16:32.140 --> 00:16:34.700
 based on models you get a lot of women who are kind of frozen in

00:16:34.700 --> 00:16:37.340
 time forever so there was. Well like the statue of Liberty was

00:16:37.340 --> 00:16:40.620
 based on his mum wasn't it? Eiffel's mum. Right, exactly.

00:16:40.620 --> 00:16:43.260
 And Audrey Munson have we I don't think we've mentioned her. Audrey Munson no we

00:16:43.260 --> 00:16:46.540
 haven't she's amazing. So she's she's in about 30 or 40

00:16:46.540 --> 00:16:50.860
 statues across New York like loads and loads and loads of statues because

00:16:50.860 --> 00:16:54.380
 when these amazing buildings were being thrown up all over New York the New

00:16:54.380 --> 00:16:56.780
 York Public Library the Manhattan Municipal Building

00:16:56.780 --> 00:17:00.460
 she was incredibly fashionable she was modeling for sculptors she was

00:17:00.460 --> 00:17:04.540
 very famous and very famously beautiful she's all over New York basically.

00:17:04.540 --> 00:17:07.660
 So weird you will have seen her but you've never heard of her if you're in New York

00:17:07.660 --> 00:17:10.380
 you've seen her. Yeah yeah she's everywhere and she but she had a really

00:17:10.380 --> 00:17:13.900
 tragic life because it sort of all went wrong for her and she struggled with

00:17:13.900 --> 00:17:17.340
 mental illness and suicide attempts and things like that she

00:17:17.340 --> 00:17:20.380
 and she was confined to an institution relatively soon after

00:17:20.380 --> 00:17:24.620
 her period of enormous fame and the amazing thing is she was she lived there

00:17:24.620 --> 00:17:29.900
 for 65 years. Yeah in this institution didn't she? She died in 1996, aged 104.

00:17:29.900 --> 00:17:33.980
 Wow. So when she was still alive all of the

00:17:33.980 --> 00:17:37.980
 statues of her were around everywhere. Exactly, yeah. Yeah but no one even knew

00:17:37.980 --> 00:17:41.820
 it was only in 2016 that they discovered that that was her who died in 96 no one

00:17:41.820 --> 00:17:45.100
 knew who she was anymore. Do you think she would have walked around going

00:17:45.100 --> 00:17:50.220
 fucks a bit lightly? Yeah I mean yeah yeah. Going paranoid yeah thinking why you're on

00:17:50.220 --> 00:17:53.740
 the treatment shelf. The statues me yeah. There was the weirdest thing about her

00:17:53.740 --> 00:17:58.060
 was that she became an actress and was in some films but really only played

00:17:58.060 --> 00:18:02.220
 parts and films that involved her being a character who posed for sculptors

00:18:02.220 --> 00:18:06.940
 and she was in a bunch of films. She was in the first film that featured a

00:18:06.940 --> 00:18:10.700
 naked person that wasn't a porn film it was called Inspiration and another

00:18:10.700 --> 00:18:15.820
 film called Heedless Moths and she cited. Heedless Moths? Sorry Andy to disappoint

00:18:15.820 --> 00:18:19.100
 you. No that's that title is still available to you it's Heedless Moths.

00:18:19.100 --> 00:18:23.980
 Oh okay that's interesting. Sorry. That's fine. But the weird thing is she cited as

00:18:23.980 --> 00:18:30.460
 the lead actress but she only was in the scenes where she was posing still as a

00:18:30.460 --> 00:18:35.900
 model and she had a stunt double who did all of her acting scenes so there's a

00:18:35.900 --> 00:18:39.340
 woman called I think called Jane Thomas who was just did all of the actual

00:18:39.340 --> 00:18:43.180
 acting in her films. That's so funny. That was excited but she did the sitting

00:18:43.180 --> 00:18:47.500
 still and modeling. Like a stunt single. A stunt single exactly yeah yeah. That's

00:18:47.500 --> 00:18:52.300
 incredible. So when Garfield was shot Alexander Graham Bell had been testing

00:18:52.300 --> 00:18:55.900
 out this metal detector anyway the idea of it and then he tested it by firing

00:18:55.900 --> 00:18:59.340
 bullets into animal carcasses and then seeing if he could find them with the

00:18:59.340 --> 00:19:03.100
 metal detector. Right. And then he tested it on Civil War veterans who had

00:19:03.100 --> 00:19:07.740
 bullets in them still so to see if I can find that and basically Alexander

00:19:07.740 --> 00:19:11.820
 Graham Bell got this device really good and then Dr. Bliss if you remember

00:19:11.820 --> 00:19:15.820
 President Garfield's doctor who was actually called Doctor his first name.

00:19:15.820 --> 00:19:18.940
 No but Dr. Bliss insisted well the bullet's on the right side of the torso

00:19:18.940 --> 00:19:22.780
 and we can't find anything on the right side. Garfield dies, autopsy happens,

00:19:22.780 --> 00:19:26.700
 bullets on the left side of the torso. Classic Dr. Bliss. No I meant the right

00:19:26.700 --> 00:19:32.140
 side as you're as he stands. Stay tried, stay tried. I thought we mentioned the

00:19:32.140 --> 00:19:36.060
 problem in that first episode was that he was laying on a bed that had springs

00:19:36.060 --> 00:19:39.340
 underneath. That might have been another problem. Yeah.

00:19:39.340 --> 00:19:42.540
 So it was metal not he was bouncing up and down too much to be able to.

00:19:42.540 --> 00:19:46.380
 He sits still Garfield.

00:19:46.380 --> 00:19:50.860
 Did you guys read that interview with Mama Cass' daughter recently?

00:19:50.860 --> 00:19:54.780
 So she was famous for having died choking on a ham sandwich

00:19:54.780 --> 00:19:57.900
 apparently. That was the story yeah. That was always the story everyone always

00:19:57.900 --> 00:20:01.260
 jokes about it and actually we found out where that story

00:20:01.260 --> 00:20:04.300
 originally came from and it was a journalist trying to protect her so

00:20:04.300 --> 00:20:07.820
 it's quite similar to the Elvis thing where basically this journalist once

00:20:07.820 --> 00:20:12.220
 said to Mama Cass' daughter look I'm really sorry I was the one who started

00:20:12.220 --> 00:20:15.020
 that story because further her daughter it's been a real pain in the ass because

00:20:15.020 --> 00:20:16.940
 everyone goes oh your mum choked on a ham sandwich.

00:20:16.940 --> 00:20:19.500
 It's in the Austin Powers movie. It's in the Austin Powers movie. He's going through the

00:20:19.500 --> 00:20:22.700
 holodecks of all his friends who've died and deceased drugs, deceased drugs,

00:20:22.700 --> 00:20:26.380
 deceased ham sandwich. Ham sandwich. Yeah.

00:20:26.380 --> 00:20:30.380
 You were robbed of that part dude. You were absolutely robbed.

00:20:30.380 --> 00:20:33.980
 How did you know it was me?

00:20:34.700 --> 00:20:38.780
 Anyway as she said to protect the cause of death in case it's something like

00:20:38.780 --> 00:20:41.580
 drugs or something. Let's say ham sandwich shows out that's

00:20:41.580 --> 00:20:44.460
 worse. Interesting. Do you all have as a result of

00:20:44.460 --> 00:20:48.860
 research a favorite ancient coin because I do now?

00:20:48.860 --> 00:20:53.020
 Not ancient. I'm not talking like bronze age. I'm talking just sort of like old

00:20:53.020 --> 00:20:56.700
 yeah. Well for me it's from 1503 James the Fourth of

00:20:56.700 --> 00:20:59.660
 Scotland. He had a coin which was worth about 20

00:20:59.660 --> 00:21:02.940
 shillings which was known as the unicorn. What's really nice is

00:21:02.940 --> 00:21:07.180
 he basically he had it made specifically or it was made specifically

00:21:07.180 --> 00:21:10.700
 to give foreigners who were coming over. So it was kind of a novelty coin

00:21:10.700 --> 00:21:14.380
 but it was legal. But it was legal tender. I bet though in a

00:21:14.380 --> 00:21:18.460
 your average tavern you would get a really annoyed reaction from the bartender

00:21:18.460 --> 00:21:21.020
 if you tried to pay with the unicorn. It is actually legal.

00:21:21.020 --> 00:21:23.820
 This is legal. Yeah. Do you say it was James the Fourth?

00:21:23.820 --> 00:21:27.660
 Scotland. Scotland. Oh yeah. We'll try spending that south of the border.

00:21:27.660 --> 00:21:32.540
 New York stuffed. I imagine people going pups of hope going

00:21:32.540 --> 00:21:37.100
 you can be one of the owners of this James the Fourth unicorn

00:21:37.100 --> 00:21:40.860
 coin. Only 500 were minted so get in there fast.

00:21:40.860 --> 00:21:44.460
 Yeah but that's what's that's what's quite fun. It is a novelty coin back in the

00:21:44.460 --> 00:21:48.780
 in the 1500s in the same way that like Bermuda make Bermuda triangle coins that

00:21:48.780 --> 00:21:51.500
 are in the shape of triangles. Yeah. I have one of those.

00:21:51.500 --> 00:21:57.260
 Do you? Oh I've been trying to get one that's so expensive on eBay and just Matt Parker.

00:21:57.260 --> 00:22:00.860
 I thought they stopped producing them so they kind of yeah yeah exactly.

00:22:00.860 --> 00:22:03.180
 That's crazy. Yeah so those kind of novelty things.

00:22:03.180 --> 00:22:06.220
 Okay that's it. That's your favorite coin. Has anyone else got a favorite coin?

00:22:06.220 --> 00:22:09.980
 I've got my I've got a coin from Bhutan which is also a badge.

00:22:09.980 --> 00:22:13.420
 So does it have a pin on it? Yeah it's got a pin on the back but it's a

00:22:13.420 --> 00:22:17.340
 coin and it's got a big picture of the of Wangchuk the king.

00:22:17.340 --> 00:22:21.100
 Was it originally a badge or is it like some novelty shop has made it into a

00:22:21.100 --> 00:22:23.980
 badge? All coins badges. All coins were

00:22:23.980 --> 00:22:26.460
 badges. There weren't many of them made. They were and again they were just

00:22:26.460 --> 00:22:29.900
 novelty ones but it is legal tender and it's got a picture of the king on the

00:22:29.900 --> 00:22:32.940
 front and on the back it's got a badge. And is that because people don't really

00:22:32.940 --> 00:22:36.220
 have wallets there so you just have to pin all your money to your chest?

00:22:36.220 --> 00:22:39.340
 I honestly think it's just to get idiot tourists to buy it.

00:22:39.340 --> 00:22:43.900
 Cool. Well it's worked at least once that we know of.

00:22:43.900 --> 00:22:47.420
 How hard to lie when someone asks you for money as you're walking by.

00:22:47.420 --> 00:22:52.700
 Sorry I just don't carry cash on me anymore. Bottles used to be made of leather

00:22:52.700 --> 00:22:57.260
 did they? Yeah and I read this book a tome from 1921 which I found in the

00:22:57.260 --> 00:22:59.980
 library called Black Jacks and Leather Bottles.

00:22:59.980 --> 00:23:03.660
 The wanderer through this island of ours may sometimes encounter in castle,

00:23:03.660 --> 00:23:07.500
 college or manor house certain strange vessels huge pictures and

00:23:07.500 --> 00:23:11.500
 corpulent bottles of leather. They are peculiarly English and have been a

00:23:11.500 --> 00:23:14.700
 feature of English life down to almost modern times.

00:23:14.700 --> 00:23:18.540
 And I just had to type that all out because I couldn't copy and paste it so I

00:23:18.540 --> 00:23:21.580
 had to read it out so it's a justified result. It's a problem with books.

00:23:21.580 --> 00:23:24.700
 It's this massive tome and it's just exclusively about leather bottles and

00:23:24.700 --> 00:23:27.420
 that is one of the most interesting passages in the whole thing. I've got

00:23:27.420 --> 00:23:30.540
 I'm afraid to say books have got more interesting since 1921.

00:23:30.540 --> 00:23:34.380
 I think they're would impart a bad taste. I even find certain bottles and cans in

00:23:34.380 --> 00:23:37.180
 part a bad taste. I think if I was drinking from leather

00:23:37.180 --> 00:23:41.260
 it's going to taste like cow. Yeah unless you're drinking bovril

00:23:41.260 --> 00:23:46.460
 it'll it won't fit. Oh a nice bottle of bovril.

00:23:46.460 --> 00:23:50.380
 That sounds great. Yeah and a blackjack was a leather picture

00:23:50.380 --> 00:23:53.260
 or a jug and that's where we get blackjacks you know we like a cosh

00:23:53.260 --> 00:23:56.380
 if you again probably in the 40s like um

00:23:56.380 --> 00:24:00.540
 I don't know. You get one blackjack. Comey blackjack is um a card game. It's a card game

00:24:00.540 --> 00:24:03.420
 but no you know guys he's got a blackjack you know that's a sort of it's a

00:24:03.420 --> 00:24:06.220
 little. Doesn't help me. It's doing it in that accent. It's like

00:24:06.220 --> 00:24:10.220
 it's a sort of like Philip Marlowe era detective story you know you'd have a

00:24:10.220 --> 00:24:12.780
 blackjack in your but it's a little leather bag basically that you can

00:24:12.780 --> 00:24:16.140
 use to hit someone very hard. Got it. All right. A bag. Like a bag.

00:24:16.140 --> 00:24:21.820
 If you were waiting for the noun. Yeah it was a bag. Come on. Like a bag of

00:24:21.820 --> 00:24:25.180
 snooker balls. Yeah exactly that. Like it's equivalent of a

00:24:25.180 --> 00:24:28.300
 knuckle duster or something. It's a little thing you can carry on

00:24:28.300 --> 00:24:31.020
 you as to use as a weapon. Didn't know that. What?

00:24:31.020 --> 00:24:34.860
 Yeah. Not good to know. Good to know the etymology of a word we've never heard of.

00:24:34.860 --> 00:24:38.780
 Oh no. So you said he was called John Byrd and

00:24:38.780 --> 00:24:43.420
 Sanderson Haldane but he was named after his great uncle who was called John

00:24:43.420 --> 00:24:46.860
 Byrd and Sanderson and he was the person who first

00:24:46.860 --> 00:24:50.780
 reported that penicillium inhibited the growth of bacteria.

00:24:50.780 --> 00:24:54.300
 I thought that was um Fleming. Alexander Fleming. Yes you thought that

00:24:54.300 --> 00:24:56.860
 didn't you but actually there are quite a few people before him that

00:24:56.860 --> 00:25:01.100
 realized that this mold stopped bacteria from growing but what Fleming did he

00:25:01.100 --> 00:25:06.380
 isolated penicillin from the penicillium. Oh. That's way less

00:25:06.380 --> 00:25:09.580
 impressive. I know. You played a trick you said penicillium

00:25:09.580 --> 00:25:13.180
 and thought like a fool I would just hear penicillin which I did.

00:25:13.180 --> 00:25:19.020
 You're a cillium billium. Oh. No. God. Yes John Scott Haldane he also

00:25:19.020 --> 00:25:22.860
 came up with the idea of canaries and coal mines. Oh.

00:25:22.860 --> 00:25:25.980
 Papa. Papa Haldane. Oh wow. To find out if the

00:25:25.980 --> 00:25:29.180
 coal mine is about to kill everyone. Yeah exactly because they will

00:25:29.180 --> 00:25:33.660
 faint from gas before the coal mine as well. I thought canary fainting is a

00:25:33.660 --> 00:25:38.380
 funny idea isn't it just swimming. Oh. The cages all

00:25:38.380 --> 00:25:41.500
 have a little chase long for them to collapse onto. Yeah.

00:25:41.500 --> 00:25:44.220
 But when he was doing his experiments on the bends

00:25:44.220 --> 00:25:48.540
 going up and down the water column he said that the drum

00:25:48.540 --> 00:25:52.060
 of the ear when it explodes because this is what happened to him

00:25:52.060 --> 00:25:57.020
 generally heals up and if a hole remains in it although one is somewhat deaf

00:25:57.020 --> 00:26:01.820
 one can blow tobacco smoke out of the ear in question.

00:26:01.820 --> 00:26:05.900
 So that was his party trick. What senior. Yeah. Oh my goodness. He used to go to

00:26:05.900 --> 00:26:09.180
 parties and because he'd done these experiments his eardrum burst and he

00:26:09.180 --> 00:26:12.780
 would like smoke a cigarette and blow rings out of his ears.

00:26:12.780 --> 00:26:16.140
 No he could have made rings. That's incredible. That's incredible. Of course he could. Of course

00:26:16.140 --> 00:26:19.900
 he could. Yeah I completely back it. Okay. Because you always hear oh it's ear nose

00:26:19.900 --> 00:26:22.540
 and throat don't you and everyone says oh well actually it's ear nose and throat

00:26:22.540 --> 00:26:25.340
 you know the ear nose and throat are all connected and you're like yeah yeah yeah

00:26:25.340 --> 00:26:29.100
 nose and throat sure. Yeah I feel like a bit of a stretch.

00:26:29.100 --> 00:26:33.340
 Come on then. That's someone who's obviously never had an ear infection

00:26:33.340 --> 00:26:36.940
 immediately after a sinus infection and immediately after a nose infection.

00:26:36.940 --> 00:26:41.740
 That's fair. I'm sure I have actually. I wonder if any kings or queens around the

00:26:41.740 --> 00:26:44.780
 world would like to marry some podcasters to help the

00:26:44.780 --> 00:26:48.620
