24
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:35,900
 compilation it's just the four of us this week me Andy James and Anna hope you

25
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:38,980
 enjoy here we go

26
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:56,660
 my fact is that in some American states in the late 1980s children could be sent

27
00:01:56,660 --> 00:02:00,900
 sorry I just got the giggles from the last bit

28
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:05,500
 my fact is that in some American states in the late 1980s children could be sent

29
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:14,260
 to prison. Why children being sent to prison is rarely such a comical item. Why is that so funny Andy? I would say it's a bit of a sat-in

30
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:29,900
 indictment of American society because these children are sent to prison. I've been to

31
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:35,840
 Lynchburg Tennessee which you know the Jack Daniels factory sorry it's not a

32
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:42,220
 Jack Daniels factory they don't call it the factory what do they call it but

33
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:45,280
 that's dry and you're allowed to buy the whiskey there but I don't think you're

34
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:49,060
 allowed to open it. Did you go to the distillery itself? Yeah yeah yeah oh we

35
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:52,260
 had a tour it was so interesting. Is it true I think they say this that Jack

36
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:57,380
 Daniels died when he kicked a barrel and got sepsis on his foot. I always can ask that as well did you learn that from a tube

37
00:02:57,380 --> 00:03:00,820
 poster in the London Underground? No I already knew it but then I saw it on the

38
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:04,300
 tube poster and I thought oh it must be true. Yeah exactly one of those incredibly

39
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:07,580
 nostalgic adverts in London I don't know if they do this in America but

40
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:11,900
 basically all the Jack Daniels adverts are old Mr. Jack because everybody used

41
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:15,980
 to call him and he would have this funny thing he'd say and they have such a

42
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:18,340
 sucker for them they really work on me despite the fact I do not think Jack

43
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:23,980
 Daniels tastes nice. Yeah I mean he's gone to the distillery. I know you were just on the

44
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:27,420
 tube you were gonna get the Northern line that's a Monnington Crescent you're

45
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:31,380
 like you know what I feel like going all the way to Lynchburg County. I turned around

46
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:38,980
 on the big Italy line went to Heathrow. Can I tell you the best named Flight

47
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:43,820
 Attendant I found? Gone. This is in 1956 there was I think a beauty competition

48
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:48,340
 because it was the 50s for Flight Attendants or Miss Skyway. Anyway the

49
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:52,580
 winner I can't believe this she was a 22 year old hostess and her name was Muffet

50
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:58,940
 Webb. Wow. Little Miss Muffet. Wait but those were the days when Flight Attendants

51
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:03,420
 had to give themselves sort of porn names. But actually remember last week we

52
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:08,260
 established that the word Muff is a man's name so Muffet doesn't make sense

53
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:11,900
 that that might be a female name. Yeah I just think what are the odds of being

54
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:14,900
 called Webb as your surname which a spider makes and then your first name

55
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:18,700
 being Muffet. Little Miss Muffet famously encounters the spider. So do you think the

56
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:23,340
 parents were told that I went oh we never noticed. I think maybe. I think it's a

57
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:26,460
 loose enough connection you have to go all the way through that rhyme to get to

58
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:29,260
 the spider bit. Disagree it was the first thing I thought of. Yeah. I thought my

59
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:32,860
 crazy name. But you do recite that 20 times a day don't you when you're cleaning

60
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:38,740
 your teeth. Used to be quite strange being interviewed to be a Flight

61
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:41,140
 Attendant. There was a piece which interviewed lots of people who've been

62
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:45,060
 Flight Attendants in the 50s, 60s and 70s and they recalled things they've been

63
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:48,660
 asked. One of them in fact who was working for a European airline in the

64
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:51,780
 1960s said that in her interview she was asked to name the Prime Minister of

65
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:56,420
 Malta which is weird. Oh gosh I don't think I could do that. No. No well we

66
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:59,420
 would all fail the Flight Attendant. Would she be interviewed for a gig that went

67
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:03,180
 to Malta? Among others it was just I think it went all over Europe. Oh that is

68
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:06,180
 impressive. Yeah it is. She said she'd just seen a TV show on him the day

69
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:12,420
 before which helped. Suggests that he was more famous whenever this positive

70
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:16,540
 quiz was coming up. 1969 he was the most famous person in the world. Broadcasting

71
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:20,900
 has changed hasn't it. You don't get that level of detail these days. No. Though in

72
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:24,020
 the 1960s one of them recalled that continental airlines you had to have a

73
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:27,860
 full pelvic exam to make sure you weren't pregnant and nor had you had

74
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:31,140
 children. Wow. Because I think we've mentioned before you weren't allowed to

75
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:36,020
 have had children. You had to be a single woman. How invasive do you have to

76
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:39,620
 get to tell if someone has had a child? Yeah I don't know how they could tell

77
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:44,180
 actually. That feels like a difficult thing to judge. It does but I'm sure

78
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:47,780
 every interviewer was perfectly well trained and qualified to respectfully

79
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:52,620
 perform the pelvic exam before asking you know what are your greatest strengths.

80
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:56,620
 My pelvic floor.

81
00:05:56,620 --> 00:06:01,820
 I find the story like the old medical uses of leeches you read how the blood

82
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:04,620
 letting happens but there's one that I'd never heard of which just sounds

83
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:08,700
 terrifying which is to do tonsillitis treatment which is that you would

84
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:12,940
 strap a rope or a little string around your leech and you would lower it down

85
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:17,900
 your throat like Tom Cruise and Mission Impossible sort of slowly not touching

86
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:20,780
 anything making sure not to set anything off and then boom onto the

87
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:26,380
 tonsils and that just sounds agony. But they would put on people's bottoms on a

88
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:31,820
 on a leash as well. Yeah. You'd have. Leech on a leash. That's it.

89
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:37,100
 Crumbs as well. Crumbs.

90
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:41,340
 Searched in Dublin called Jonathan Osbourne in the 1830s he said if you got

91
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:45,100
 inflamed intestines well I've got a new

92
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:49,340
 collar arrangement for a leech and I'll just send one on up there

93
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:52,460
 and he said I've never used more than four leeches at once.

94
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:56,940
 Upper bum. I believe so I'm afraid. Yeah quite right there.

95
00:06:56,940 --> 00:07:00,540
 Well they're very adventurous apparently which is why they needed the leash

96
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:03,500
 because they would want to go into lots of orifices and would try if you put them

97
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:05,500
 in one bit the body they'll try to get to another.

98
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:08,700
 I'm not surprised. I don't think they can be tamed leeches.

99
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:11,580
 Well people have kept them as pets though. Have they?

100
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:15,020
 In the past. I was reading about one guy the Lord Chancellor I think in the

101
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:21,340
 early 19th century. He did life was saved by a leech so he

102
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:26,540
 thought two leeches who bled him and so he kept them as pets. But he didn't take

103
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:31,020
 them for like walks in large parks did he? Not only in small parks because they

104
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:36,140
 don't need big walks leeches like Greyhounds.

105
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:39,820
 You used to rent them because they were so expensive because they were used so

106
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:42,860
 much they were driven to basically extinction in Western Europe and you'd

107
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:47,340
 have a leech in your shop window all dressed up to look fine.

108
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:50,940
 But they would like decorate them but they would need amazing bodice

109
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:53,420
 play boxes. Like a sex worker in Amsterdam.

110
00:07:53,420 --> 00:08:00,540
 Like that yes and in the same way they weren't one use only.

111
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:04,380
 But the trade was mega. The leech trade across Europe was massive because

112
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:07,820
 in the UK they started running low but there was big demand so there were

113
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:11,100
 wetlands and they were transported by sea they were

114
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:14,140
 kept in portable swamps. Countries would raid each other's

115
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:17,580
 leech farms. Come on. No it's true. It's all 100 years

116
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:21,020
 well started isn't it. There was smuggling. Leech smuggling. The

117
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:26,860
 Germans built large leech parks. Oh yeah where did they smuggle them?

118
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:30,700
 No more than four that time.

119
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:35,260
 America used to have a group of citizen vigilantes who could bust into your

120
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:37,740
 home and see if you had too many cans of food.

121
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:42,860
 Really? Yeah. This is insane. The Harvest Festival squad. It kind of is.

122
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:48,060
 So this is first world war. There was some rationing on in America

123
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:52,140
 1918 and the group was called the American Protective League

124
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:55,420
 and they started off with quite grandiose aims. We're going to catch foreign

125
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:58,700
 spies in America and then they quickly added to their brief.

126
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:01,580
 And one of the briefs was finding food hoarders.

127
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:04,540
 People who'd been you know busting the rationing rules.

128
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:07,660
 Citizen groups could legally enter other people's homes and just check if they

129
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:11,420
 had been hoarding food. No way. Yeah and they had badges and

130
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:14,300
 ranks and I think they were eventually disbanded because people said

131
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:17,660
 not sure we want this especially now that the war's over.

132
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:21,180
 So yeah that was the thing. You don't like that guy do you?

133
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:25,980
 Barry comes over wearing his badge. Looking in your pantry.

134
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:30,940
 Sod off mate. I got that was there. People in the USA love carrying their own food.

135
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:35,260
 It's a big trend. What you buy fresh sardines and then you count them at home.

136
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:38,460
 Your own produce. Your own produce. Yeah yeah if you grow tomatoes or whatever.

137
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:41,260
 Yeah and there are there are all these different groups. There are some people

138
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:44,380
 are doing it for preppy reasons. Some people who are kind of you know just

139
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:48,380
 want to eat eco and all of this and there are home canning machines much like

140
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:51,660
 James's Electric can open up probably. The opposite really?

141
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:55,020
 Yeah that's exactly the opposite. Yeah whatever. Okay move on.

142
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:58,540
 There are rebel counters who claim that government food safety guidelines are

143
00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:03,980
 basically just state overreach. Yeah there's a thriving ecosystem.

144
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:06,780
 So what are they doing when they claim that that's overreach? Do they say that

145
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:10,060
 we'll can this and keep it for longer than the government says?

146
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:12,540
 Or are you not technically allowed to home can maybe?

147
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:15,340
 No you are technically allowed to do it. So what's rebellious about the rebel

148
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:17,500
 canners? I think they just ignore government food

149
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:24,780
 safety guidelines. Oh yeah. Good on them. Fighting the good fight.

150
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:28,220
 William Wordsworth wrote a poem about leeches once. Did he? Yeah it's called

151
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:32,540
 The Leech Gatherer. I wandered lonely as a leech.

152
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:37,180
 Can I read you a few lines? Yes please. Okay. From pond to pond he roamed

153
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:39,740
 gathering leeches far and wide he travelled

154
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:43,580
 stirring thus about his feet the waters of the pool where they abide

155
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:48,140
 and then open quote marks once I could meet with them on every side

156
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:53,180
 but they have dwindled long by slow decay yet still I persevere and find them

157
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:56,220
 where I may. So he's writing about the decline

158
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:59,980
 of the English leech gatherer because all the leeches have been

159
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:03,100
 used up for medicine. Sorry where's where did the quote marks

160
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:09,980
 quote marks close? Still I'm still going, excuse me.

161
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:15,100
 Does his poem includes Dan's outro as well?

162
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:19,660
 Wordsworth. What a thinker. Yeah but he's sort of writing about changing

163
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:24,220
 industrial conditions for leech. Yeah. You know working yeah yeah.

164
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:28,220
 And there was an anarchist community in the late 19th century

165
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:33,180
 in America called the Mutual Home Colony Association.

166
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:36,940
 Things were going really well no one's in charge they're all growing their own

167
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:40,700
 food doing all this kind of stuff but then some of the anarchists

168
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:44,700
 wanted to go skinny dipping and wear no clothes

169
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:48,300
 and some of them thought well actually this is the clothes part

170
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:52,700
 of society I kind of like that part and so there was a big argument

171
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:56,700
 and nudity was illegal in that part of America and so the people who

172
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:59,740
 didn't like nudity didn't like the skinny dipping

173
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:03,900
 went to the police outside of the community and said look there's some

174
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:07,180
 naked people here and then the police came in and arrested them

175
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:10,940
 and this obviously went off just went completely off.

176
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:15,020
 It was known in the press as the nudes versus the prudes.

177
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:19,180
 Brilliant. One of the prudes had a shop and the nudes

178
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:24,140
 refused to shop there. The nudes refused to speak to the prudes

179
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:28,300
 and the prudes retaliated with violence and physically assaulted the nudes in

180
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:32,780
 the street. Okay I know who's siding on. Who's siding on the nudes?

181
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:35,260
 If you're not speaking to someone you don't deserve them to come and punch you

182
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:38,380
 in the face. No I think it was the earlier

183
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:42,860
 problems you know that led to that. I mean that's where it escalated to.

184
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:45,660
 But yeah. I think the prudes going and getting the police from outside that's

185
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:49,820
 a bit like why have you told on me? Yeah if you're an anarchist you

186
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:53,900
 should be able to solve this within your own. Yeah I believe they tried that.

187
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:57,420
 I really. They did try to say put some clothes on please.

188
00:12:57,420 --> 00:13:01,020
 It's very hard. My children are here. Yeah if you're in a legal society and

189
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:03,420
 someone insists on taking all their clothes off I don't know what you

190
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:06,460
 could do. Yeah it's funny how often the clothes come off

191
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:09,340
 in these societies isn't it? It just always ends up there.

192
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:12,220
 So how is that related to this? There was a famous one I can't remember

193
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:16,220
 but it's called that Louisa May Olcott grew up in. She grew up in like one of

194
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:19,740
 these communities. The original little woman? Yeah yeah yeah and I wish I could

195
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:23,340
 remember this but again there was like one person

196
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:27,900
 who went around with no clothes on. One person who kind of swore all the time

197
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:31,340
 and just was like okay well I'm an anarchist community I'm just gonna swear

198
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:35,100
 because you can't do anything. That's so Joe.

199
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:38,460
 I think there was one person who would say everything backwards

200
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:42,860
 or something. Can't think of which of the sisters that's like no.

201
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:47,420
 They're like well you know I'm not part of America anymore. I can speak backwards

202
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:50,300
 if I want. Wow. It's like if you're in an anarchist

203
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:53,660
 community what would you what would you do? Like what is

204
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:56,700
 what are you not doing because the man is stopping you from doing it?

205
00:13:56,700 --> 00:14:00,700
 Oh gosh that's a good that's a great question. I mean you know my answers

206
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:04,300
 are all going to be punishingly boring.

207
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:07,180
 I'm not thatching at the moment because but I don't feel like I'm being stopped by

208
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:11,820
 the man really.

209
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:15,980
 I've never honked my horn in my life in a angry way because whenever something

210
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:19,580
 happens on the road I assume it's my fault. Anna always does it when she's

211
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:22,380
 happiest. I do it. I do a hello honk and you

212
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:24,620
 know there's that horrible thing where you're like how do I make this honk to

213
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:27,260
 my friend who I'm passing by for instance sound like a hello

214
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:29,660
 rather than an angry and you've got to do a bit of a

215
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:34,700
 boop boop boop. But your car does go ho ho ho.

216
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:40,140
 And it falls apart whenever you get to your destination.

217
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:43,740
 Do you know those are illegal in Cambodia? That particular one I just sang.

218
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:47,180
 Any. Any musical honks. Any musical horns.

219
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:50,700
 Is it because people honk so much? It is but also I think apparently there's a

220
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:54,860
 problem with people dancing to them. Right. That doesn't sound like a problem to me.

221
00:14:54,860 --> 00:15:00,300
 Well you want to be in penom pen in rush hour.

222
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:03,180
 I wonder when you were saying that the birds land down on the ship it suddenly

223
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:05,900
 made me think okay migrating birds what a great way for

224
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:09,420
 navigational tools on a on a ship. If you had a migrating birds

225
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:13,180
 anytime you let it go followed where it was flying off for a bit and then

226
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:16,700
 manage to bring it back in. Is that what they did? That's so interesting.

227
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:20,060
 Noah's honk. Noah's honk? Did Noah do that? Yeah.

228
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:25,100
 Yeah. To where? Where's he really going? He releases the dove

229
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:29,260
 and it comes back with an olive in its beak. Not an olive. Come on it wasn't

230
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:35,500
 18 olive. And it's holding a martini in its claws.

231
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:38,940
 Sorry, an olive branch. And he's like, ah, there'll be land.

232
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:44,380
 You know that's and then. It was from Devon, wasn't it?

233
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:48,140
 Um I found one as well which is do you know that New Zealand has a coat of

234
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:51,420
 arms? I'd actually never seen it before but as a coat of arms and there are

235
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:54,300
 people on it. Oh. There's a there's a woman on it.

236
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:58,140
 And the woman is Grace Kelly the actor. Yeah.

237
00:15:58,140 --> 00:16:01,900
 Is she New Zealander? No she's not but in 1949

238
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:05,340
 there was an election of the first national government and the new

239
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:08,700
 attorney general who was called Jack Marshall who later became prime minister

240
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:12,940
 he had the responsibility of running the committee for the coat of arms

241
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:16,620
 and he asked for the woman to be redrawn based on the likeness of Grace Kelly

242
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:21,260
 because that was his favorite actress. Oh really? Yeah. So she's on forever now.

243
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:23,980
 New Zealand has Grace Kelly on it. Yeah.

244
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:28,140
 It's weird isn't it? Yeah. It's weird. It's weird seeing this thing because

245
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:32,140
 you get a lot of like with these statues of generic female statues which are

246
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:34,700
 based on models you get a lot of women who are kind of frozen in

247
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:37,340
 time forever so there was. Well like the statue of Liberty was

248
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:40,620
 based on his mum wasn't it? Eiffel's mum. Right, exactly.

249
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:43,260
 And Audrey Munson have we I don't think we've mentioned her. Audrey Munson no we

250
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:46,540
 haven't she's amazing. So she's she's in about 30 or 40

251
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:50,860
 statues across New York like loads and loads and loads of statues because

252
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:54,380
 when these amazing buildings were being thrown up all over New York the New

253
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:56,780
 York Public Library the Manhattan Municipal Building

254
00:16:56,780 --> 00:17:00,460
 she was incredibly fashionable she was modeling for sculptors she was

255
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:04,540
 very famous and very famously beautiful she's all over New York basically.

256
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:07,660
 So weird you will have seen her but you've never heard of her if you're in New York

257
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:10,380
 you've seen her. Yeah yeah she's everywhere and she but she had a really

258
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:13,900
 tragic life because it sort of all went wrong for her and she struggled with

259
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:17,340
 mental illness and suicide attempts and things like that she

260
00:17:17,340 --> 00:17:20,380
 and she was confined to an institution relatively soon after

261
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:24,620
 her period of enormous fame and the amazing thing is she was she lived there

262
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:29,900
 for 65 years. Yeah in this institution didn't she? She died in 1996, aged 104.

263
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:33,980
 Wow. So when she was still alive all of the

264
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:37,980
 statues of her were around everywhere. Exactly, yeah. Yeah but no one even knew

265
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:41,820
 it was only in 2016 that they discovered that that was her who died in 96 no one

266
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:45,100
 knew who she was anymore. Do you think she would have walked around going

267
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:50,220
 fucks a bit lightly? Yeah I mean yeah yeah. Going paranoid yeah thinking why you're on

268
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:53,740
 the treatment shelf. The statues me yeah. There was the weirdest thing about her

269
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:58,060
 was that she became an actress and was in some films but really only played

270
00:17:58,060 --> 00:18:02,220
 parts and films that involved her being a character who posed for sculptors

271
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:06,940
 and she was in a bunch of films. She was in the first film that featured a

272
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:10,700
 naked person that wasn't a porn film it was called Inspiration and another

273
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:15,820
 film called Heedless Moths and she cited. Heedless Moths? Sorry Andy to disappoint

274
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:19,100
 you. No that's that title is still available to you it's Heedless Moths.

275
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:23,980
 Oh okay that's interesting. Sorry. That's fine. But the weird thing is she cited as

276
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:30,460
 the lead actress but she only was in the scenes where she was posing still as a

277
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:35,900
 model and she had a stunt double who did all of her acting scenes so there's a

278
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:39,340
 woman called I think called Jane Thomas who was just did all of the actual

279
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:43,180
 acting in her films. That's so funny. That was excited but she did the sitting

280
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:47,500
 still and modeling. Like a stunt single. A stunt single exactly yeah yeah. That's

281
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:52,300
 incredible. So when Garfield was shot Alexander Graham Bell had been testing

282
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:55,900
 out this metal detector anyway the idea of it and then he tested it by firing

283
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:59,340
 bullets into animal carcasses and then seeing if he could find them with the

284
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:03,100
 metal detector. Right. And then he tested it on Civil War veterans who had

285
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:07,740
 bullets in them still so to see if I can find that and basically Alexander

286
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:11,820
 Graham Bell got this device really good and then Dr. Bliss if you remember

287
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:15,820
 President Garfield's doctor who was actually called Doctor his first name.

288
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:18,940
 No but Dr. Bliss insisted well the bullet's on the right side of the torso

289
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:22,780
 and we can't find anything on the right side. Garfield dies, autopsy happens,

290
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:26,700
 bullets on the left side of the torso. Classic Dr. Bliss. No I meant the right

291
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:32,140
 side as you're as he stands. Stay tried, stay tried. I thought we mentioned the

292
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:36,060
 problem in that first episode was that he was laying on a bed that had springs

293
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:39,340
 underneath. That might have been another problem. Yeah.

294
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:42,540
 So it was metal not he was bouncing up and down too much to be able to.

295
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:46,380
 He sits still Garfield.

296
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:50,860
 Did you guys read that interview with Mama Cass' daughter recently?

297
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:54,780
 So she was famous for having died choking on a ham sandwich

298
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:57,900
 apparently. That was the story yeah. That was always the story everyone always

299
00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:01,260
 jokes about it and actually we found out where that story

300
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:04,300
 originally came from and it was a journalist trying to protect her so

301
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:07,820
 it's quite similar to the Elvis thing where basically this journalist once

302
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:12,220
 said to Mama Cass' daughter look I'm really sorry I was the one who started

303
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:15,020
 that story because further her daughter it's been a real pain in the ass because

304
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:16,940
 everyone goes oh your mum choked on a ham sandwich.

305
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:19,500
 It's in the Austin Powers movie. It's in the Austin Powers movie. He's going through the

306
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:22,700
 holodecks of all his friends who've died and deceased drugs, deceased drugs,

307
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:26,380
 deceased ham sandwich. Ham sandwich. Yeah.

308
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:30,380
 You were robbed of that part dude. You were absolutely robbed.

309
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:33,980
 How did you know it was me?

310
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:38,780
 Anyway as she said to protect the cause of death in case it's something like

311
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:41,580
 drugs or something. Let's say ham sandwich shows out that's

312
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:44,460
 worse. Interesting. Do you all have as a result of

313
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:48,860
 research a favorite ancient coin because I do now?

314
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:53,020
 Not ancient. I'm not talking like bronze age. I'm talking just sort of like old

315
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:56,700
 yeah. Well for me it's from 1503 James the Fourth of

316
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:59,660
 Scotland. He had a coin which was worth about 20

317
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:02,940
 shillings which was known as the unicorn. What's really nice is

318
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:07,180
 he basically he had it made specifically or it was made specifically

319
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:10,700
 to give foreigners who were coming over. So it was kind of a novelty coin

320
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:14,380
 but it was legal. But it was legal tender. I bet though in a

321
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:18,460
 your average tavern you would get a really annoyed reaction from the bartender

322
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:21,020
 if you tried to pay with the unicorn. It is actually legal.

323
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:23,820
 This is legal. Yeah. Do you say it was James the Fourth?

324
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:27,660
 Scotland. Scotland. Oh yeah. We'll try spending that south of the border.

325
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:32,540
 New York stuffed. I imagine people going pups of hope going

326
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:37,100
 you can be one of the owners of this James the Fourth unicorn

327
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:40,860
 coin. Only 500 were minted so get in there fast.

328
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:44,460
 Yeah but that's what's that's what's quite fun. It is a novelty coin back in the

329
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:48,780
 in the 1500s in the same way that like Bermuda make Bermuda triangle coins that

330
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:51,500
 are in the shape of triangles. Yeah. I have one of those.

331
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:57,260
 Do you? Oh I've been trying to get one that's so expensive on eBay and just Matt Parker.

332
00:21:57,260 --> 00:22:00,860
 I thought they stopped producing them so they kind of yeah yeah exactly.

333
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:03,180
 That's crazy. Yeah so those kind of novelty things.

334
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:06,220
 Okay that's it. That's your favorite coin. Has anyone else got a favorite coin?

335
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:09,980
 I've got my I've got a coin from Bhutan which is also a badge.

336
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:13,420
 So does it have a pin on it? Yeah it's got a pin on the back but it's a

337
00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:17,340
 coin and it's got a big picture of the of Wangchuk the king.

338
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:21,100
 Was it originally a badge or is it like some novelty shop has made it into a

339
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:23,980
 badge? All coins badges. All coins were

340
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:26,460
 badges. There weren't many of them made. They were and again they were just

341
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:29,900
 novelty ones but it is legal tender and it's got a picture of the king on the

342
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:32,940
 front and on the back it's got a badge. And is that because people don't really

343
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:36,220
 have wallets there so you just have to pin all your money to your chest?

344
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:39,340
 I honestly think it's just to get idiot tourists to buy it.

345
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:43,900
 Cool. Well it's worked at least once that we know of.

346
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:47,420
 How hard to lie when someone asks you for money as you're walking by.

347
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:52,700
 Sorry I just don't carry cash on me anymore. Bottles used to be made of leather

348
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:57,260
 did they? Yeah and I read this book a tome from 1921 which I found in the

349
00:22:57,260 --> 00:22:59,980
 library called Black Jacks and Leather Bottles.

350
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:03,660
 The wanderer through this island of ours may sometimes encounter in castle,

351
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:07,500
 college or manor house certain strange vessels huge pictures and

352
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:11,500
 corpulent bottles of leather. They are peculiarly English and have been a

353
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:14,700
 feature of English life down to almost modern times.

354
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:18,540
 And I just had to type that all out because I couldn't copy and paste it so I

355
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:21,580
 had to read it out so it's a justified result. It's a problem with books.

356
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:24,700
 It's this massive tome and it's just exclusively about leather bottles and

357
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:27,420
 that is one of the most interesting passages in the whole thing. I've got

358
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:30,540
 I'm afraid to say books have got more interesting since 1921.

359
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:34,380
 I think they're would impart a bad taste. I even find certain bottles and cans in

360
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:37,180
 part a bad taste. I think if I was drinking from leather

361
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:41,260
 it's going to taste like cow. Yeah unless you're drinking bovril

362
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:46,460
 it'll it won't fit. Oh a nice bottle of bovril.

363
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:50,380
 That sounds great. Yeah and a blackjack was a leather picture

364
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:53,260
 or a jug and that's where we get blackjacks you know we like a cosh

365
00:23:53,260 --> 00:23:56,380
 if you again probably in the 40s like um

366
00:23:56,380 --> 00:24:00,540
 I don't know. You get one blackjack. Comey blackjack is um a card game. It's a card game

367
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:03,420
 but no you know guys he's got a blackjack you know that's a sort of it's a

368
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:06,220
 little. Doesn't help me. It's doing it in that accent. It's like

369
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:10,220
 it's a sort of like Philip Marlowe era detective story you know you'd have a

370
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:12,780
 blackjack in your but it's a little leather bag basically that you can

371
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:16,140
 use to hit someone very hard. Got it. All right. A bag. Like a bag.

372
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:21,820
 If you were waiting for the noun. Yeah it was a bag. Come on. Like a bag of

373
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:25,180
 snooker balls. Yeah exactly that. Like it's equivalent of a

374
00:24:25,180 --> 00:24:28,300
 knuckle duster or something. It's a little thing you can carry on

375
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:31,020
 you as to use as a weapon. Didn't know that. What?

376
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:34,860
 Yeah. Not good to know. Good to know the etymology of a word we've never heard of.

377
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:38,780
 Oh no. So you said he was called John Byrd and

378
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:43,420
 Sanderson Haldane but he was named after his great uncle who was called John

379
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:46,860
 Byrd and Sanderson and he was the person who first

380
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:50,780
 reported that penicillium inhibited the growth of bacteria.

381
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:54,300
 I thought that was um Fleming. Alexander Fleming. Yes you thought that

382
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:56,860
 didn't you but actually there are quite a few people before him that

383
00:24:56,860 --> 00:25:01,100
 realized that this mold stopped bacteria from growing but what Fleming did he

384
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:06,380
 isolated penicillin from the penicillium. Oh. That's way less

385
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:09,580
 impressive. I know. You played a trick you said penicillium

386
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:13,180
 and thought like a fool I would just hear penicillin which I did.

387
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:19,020
 You're a cillium billium. Oh. No. God. Yes John Scott Haldane he also

388
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:22,860
 came up with the idea of canaries and coal mines. Oh.

389
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:25,980
 Papa. Papa Haldane. Oh wow. To find out if the

390
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:29,180
 coal mine is about to kill everyone. Yeah exactly because they will

391
00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:33,660
 faint from gas before the coal mine as well. I thought canary fainting is a

392
00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:38,380
 funny idea isn't it just swimming. Oh. The cages all

393
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:41,500
 have a little chase long for them to collapse onto. Yeah.

394
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:44,220
 But when he was doing his experiments on the bends

395
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:48,540
 going up and down the water column he said that the drum

396
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:52,060
 of the ear when it explodes because this is what happened to him

397
00:25:52,060 --> 00:25:57,020
 generally heals up and if a hole remains in it although one is somewhat deaf

398
00:25:57,020 --> 00:26:01,820
 one can blow tobacco smoke out of the ear in question.

399
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:05,900
 So that was his party trick. What senior. Yeah. Oh my goodness. He used to go to

400
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:09,180
 parties and because he'd done these experiments his eardrum burst and he

401
00:26:09,180 --> 00:26:12,780
 would like smoke a cigarette and blow rings out of his ears.

402
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:16,140
 No he could have made rings. That's incredible. That's incredible. Of course he could. Of course

403
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:19,900
 he could. Yeah I completely back it. Okay. Because you always hear oh it's ear nose

404
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:22,540
 and throat don't you and everyone says oh well actually it's ear nose and throat

405
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:25,340
 you know the ear nose and throat are all connected and you're like yeah yeah yeah

406
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:29,100
 nose and throat sure. Yeah I feel like a bit of a stretch.

407
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:33,340
 Come on then. That's someone who's obviously never had an ear infection

408
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:36,940
 immediately after a sinus infection and immediately after a nose infection.

409
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:41,740
 That's fair. I'm sure I have actually. I wonder if any kings or queens around the

410
00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:44,780
 world would like to marry some podcasters to help the

411
00:26:44,780 --> 00:26:48,620
 PR. Oh yeah. Great shout out. Yeah you got your eye on James.

412
