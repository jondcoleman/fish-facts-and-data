00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.480
 (ding, ding, ding)

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:04.840
 (speaking in foreign language)

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:07.600
 (ding, ding, ding, ding, ding)

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:11.240
 (speaking in foreign language)

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:13.960
 - Hello and welcome to another episode

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:15.880
 of "No Such Thing as a Fish",

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:18.640
 a weekly podcast this week coming to you live

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:19.760
 from Glasgow!

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:22.000
 (cheering)

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
 (audience cheering)

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.760
 My name is Dan Schreiber

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.000
 and I am sitting here with Andrew Hunter-Marie,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.440
 Annatuzinski and James Harkin.

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:38.040
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.080
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:42.520
 and in no particular order.

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:45.680
 Here we go, starting with you, James.

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:47.360
 - Okay, my fact this week is,

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:51.400
 when a very large star quietly turns into a black hole

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:53.480
 without the usual explosion,

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:57.120
 the official term used by astronomers is a massive fail.

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.280
 (audience laughing)

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:02.720
 - A star, as if it wasn't embarrassed enough.

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:04.840
 It wasn't able to make the explosion.

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:07.840
 - Well, it turns out that about 30% of massive stars

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:09.880
 turn into massive fails.

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:11.680
 And they found this out quite recently.

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:14.080
 They were looking at an area of the universe

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:16.240
 called the Firework Galaxy,

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:18.120
 where there's loads of supernovas.

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:19.920
 So when it explodes, when you've got a big star

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.960
 and it explodes, it's called a supernova.

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.880
 And eventually that turns into a black hole,

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.160
 but sometimes it's happening without the supernova.

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:27.880
 And this area called the Firework Galaxy

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:29.920
 had loads of supernovas.

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:32.320
 But the work quite as many as they thought there should be,

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:33.800
 and they couldn't work out why.

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:38.800
 And then they were looking at a star called N6946-BH1.

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:43.560
 - My uncle's called that, so that's a nozzly name.

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.560
 - There's a prisoner number, isn't it?

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:50.560
 (audience laughing)

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:54.960
 When he's out in five years, you'll regret saying that.

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.440
 (audience laughing)

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:59.480
 And they noticed that it wasn't there anymore in it,

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:01.880
 it just kind of quietly dissipated.

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:02.840
 This is a thing that happens

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.800
 that they've only just found out in the last six months or so.

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:08.600
 - But I think massive fail is a really unfair way

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:12.000
 to characterize it, because so basically, yes,

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.480
 the way stars turn into black holes is,

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.000
 it was thought that they turn into a supernova, as you said,

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.960
 and so there's this huge explosion.

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:22.680
 And then they suddenly shrink into a black hole.

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.880
 But then these stars aren't doing the explosion,

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:28.480
 but that actually means that they don't blow away

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:29.720
 as much of the debris.

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:33.960
 So apparently supernova blow off a lot of the stars outer layers.

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:37.360
 And so therefore, there's not as much gravitational pull

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:39.080
 left to make a massive black hole.

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:42.960
 So actually, the massive fails make a massive hole,

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:45.400
 a bigger hole than the massive successes

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.520
 or whatever they call the supernova once.

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:51.160
 - I didn't know the black holes are not really holes.

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:52.960
 - Yeah, what did you think they were?

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:54.280
 - I thought they were holes.

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:55.120
 - Oh, yeah, of course.

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:56.120
 - I had the idea.

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:57.920
 (all laughing)

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:59.080
 - I could probably even firt that

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:00.480
 from your previous sense of the stuff.

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:01.480
 - I think I made it.

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:03.120
 (all laughing)

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:06.240
 - But they're not, they're not, they're the opposite of holes.

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:08.200
 Do you guys know this, black holes are the opposite of holes?

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:09.040
 - What's the opposite of a hole?

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:10.200
 - Like a sticky out thing.

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:11.200
 - Just a big bulge.

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:13.920
 - Well, yeah, they're really, really full.

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:16.520
 They're fuller than anything you've ever seen in your life,

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:18.920
 because they're so dense.

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:21.800
 So for example, so how much do they weigh?

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:24.160
 Okay, they could have a mass greater

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:26.480
 than 20 times the mass of our sun.

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:30.840
 And the really big ones can have a mass equal to four million

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:33.960
 suns, as they're the extremely large supermassive black holes.

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:35.960
 But they are everything crunched inwards.

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:36.800
 - Yeah.

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:38.120
 - So it's just like a very large body,

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:40.160
 which has been crunched down to a tiny size.

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:41.760
 - They could be any size really.

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:45.240
 Basically, it's the density that's the important thing.

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:47.040
 So you can have tiny ones, you can have massive ones.

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:47.880
 You could be a black hole.

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:50.840
 If I squash you down to the size of about a tenth,

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:52.920
 the size of a neutrino, you would be a black hole.

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:54.640
 - Okay, but you and me would fall out.

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:56.240
 (audience laughing)

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:59.600
 - If the earth got about as dense as a black hole,

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:01.560
 if you were crunching it down to the roughly the density

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:05.320
 of a black hole, it would be about the size of an eyeball.

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:07.440
 It would be about two centimeters across.

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:08.600
 - Wow.

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:09.600
 - That density.

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:11.440
 - And the whole point of it is,

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:14.760
 the gravity is so strong, light can't get out of there.

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:16.800
 You can't get to the escape velocity

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:18.640
 because light can only go at a certain speed.

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:20.040
 And so nothing can escape,

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:22.160
 because light is the fastest thing that there is.

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:24.400
 And if light can't get out, then nothing can.

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:25.680
 - Although, that's the thing about black holes

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:27.640
 has been challenged over the last few years, isn't it?

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:31.160
 And by Stephen Hawking, who, yeah.

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:33.360
 So it was assumed that black holes did have

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:34.560
 this strong gravitational pull

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:37.000
 that would mean that everything just disappeared into them.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.680
 But it turns out they do what is referred to as a cosmic burp.

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:46.080
 And this apparently is when they consume so much,

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:49.240
 they overeat, they eat so much stuff

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:52.280
 that they're almost a force-fed huge amounts of gas

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:54.720
 and they can't swallow it all, so it's spits on back out.

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:55.560
 - That's amazing.

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:57.600
 It's really hard researching black holes,

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:00.120
 'cause I guess we don't really know fully what they are.

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:01.360
 It's all hypothetical.

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:02.720
 And as a result, they do stuff.

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:04.160
 All the headlines I was looking into

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:07.120
 is colorful language, like they burp stuff up.

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:08.960
 Or I read one that I got excited by,

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:12.920
 which was a black hole caught having a post-lunch nap

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:15.040
 after it eats solar system.

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:16.240
 And I was like, this is gonna be great.

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:17.960
 And then it was not.

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:21.240
 - What did you think it was going to be?

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:22.560
 When he said he was always gonna be great,

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:24.920
 did you think they were gonna describe the fold-out bed

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:27.760
 that they had all set up in their office?

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:28.600
 - I don't know.

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:30.600
 I clicked on it just optimistically not thinking anything.

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:31.440
 - Yeah.

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:33.520
 - So the stage before a black hole

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:34.960
 is a thing called a neutron star.

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:37.720
 So this is where a star collapses

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:39.360
 and it doesn't collapse with quite enough force

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:40.520
 to become a black hole,

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:42.360
 but it does become a thing called a neutron star,

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:43.760
 which is very, very, very dense,

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:45.240
 but not as dense as a black hole.

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:47.080
 So this is very cool.

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:52.080
 A sugar cube of neutron star would weigh on Earth a billion tons.

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:53.960
 - Yeah.

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:54.800
 - And?

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:56.760
 - It's hard to imagine what a billion tons is, isn't it, really?

00:05:56.760 --> 00:06:00.360
 - Yeah, it's like, imagine a billion one-ton elephants

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:01.480
 can I put it that way?

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:02.480
 (audience laughing)

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:03.320
 - Wow.

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:04.720
 - Yeah, exactly, right?

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:05.560
 - And.

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:07.360
 - So both of us, it's pretty difficult to pick up

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:08.960
 your cup of tea, I think.

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:10.120
 (audience laughing)

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:11.560
 That's gonna break the china.

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:13.160
 - Well, so this is the cool thing.

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:15.960
 If you drop a marshmallow onto a neutron star,

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:17.760
 if you're ever in a position to do so.

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:19.440
 (audience laughing)

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:21.240
 It's got such a strong gravitational pull

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:23.800
 that the impact will be the same as an atomic bomb,

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:25.080
 because of the amount of gravity

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:26.600
 pulling the marshmallows towards it.

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:29.720
 Do you guys know when the first supernova was recorded

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:30.720
 on Earth?

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:31.880
 - No.

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:35.600
 - The year 3,600 BC.

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:36.440
 - Hmm.

00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:39.720
 - Yeah, it's this, so this is a paper that's been put forward.

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:42.640
 It was found in Kashmir on a cave wall.

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:45.760
 It was a cave painting, which had two bright glowing objects

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:46.760
 in the sky.

00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:49.160
 And so this paper is putting forward the idea

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:50.960
 that it was the first recording of it,

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:53.800
 because the people in context of the painting

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:55.160
 weren't hunter-gatherers.

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:56.640
 They were in a very separate situation.

00:06:56.640 --> 00:06:58.200
 So they looked at it very cleverly

00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:00.000
 by going, "How can we prove

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:01.120
 that our theory is right?"

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:02.160
 It's a supernova.

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:04.320
 And there's something amazing about supernovas

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:05.760
 that have been logged.

00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:08.560
 They, you know, it can happen back in 3,600

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:09.800
 and it was glowing in the sky.

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:11.640
 But the remnants of it still exist.

00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:13.680
 You can still look for bits of it in the sky.

00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:17.240
 So they've actually been able to look at one specific supernova

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:19.280
 and date it to roughly that period.

00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:20.840
 So it's called HB9.

00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:22.520
 That's the supernova that they believe it is.

00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:25.040
 And they think 3,600 years ago in Kashmir

00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:26.200
 first ever supernova recording.

00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:27.960
 - And they named it after a pencil.

00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:28.800
 - Yeah.

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:29.800
 (audience laughing)

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:31.560
 That's actually my auntie's name in Australia.

00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:33.280
 (audience laughing)

00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:36.600
 - There was a supernova in 1054,

00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:38.200
 which was visible all over Europe.

00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:40.320
 Europe was the best place to see it.

00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:43.240
 It was visible in the daytime for three weeks.

00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:45.320
 And at night time it was so bright

00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:48.880
 that it cast shadows on people on earth.

00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:50.520
 Okay, it was absolutely massive.

00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:53.280
 But no one in Europe wrote about it.

00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:54.120
 - Why not?

00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:55.360
 - So it's written about in China.

00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:57.360
 It was written about you can see it in cave paintings

00:07:57.360 --> 00:07:59.080
 and stuff like that in other parts of the world.

00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:00.960
 Basically there was a schism going on between

00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:03.400
 the Roman Catholic church and the Orthodox church

00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:04.240
 at the time.

00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:06.400
 And apparently both sides thought that it would be

00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:07.800
 an ill omen.

00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:10.200
 And so no one wrote about it at all.

00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:11.440
 And they just kind of ignored it.

00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:12.280
 And it's like, what's that?

00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:13.120
 I want nothing.

00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:16.000
 (audience laughing)

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:17.160
 That's amazing.

00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:19.800
 - You do get rogue black holes.

00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:21.240
 These rebellious black holes

00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:23.160
 that do wander around the universe.

00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:25.720
 So a lot of black holes are at the center of galaxies

00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:27.400
 and the vast majority that we've detected

00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:29.000
 are at the center of galaxies.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.840
 But you get some that don't have their own galaxy

00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:33.880
 and they've only been detected recently.

00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:36.040
 But it's kind of thought that they've basically

00:08:36.040 --> 00:08:38.800
 had their galaxy stolen off them.

00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:39.640
 So this is weird.

00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:42.400
 This is what astronomers call mergers.

00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:44.320
 It's like a financial terminology.

00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:47.720
 But a minor merger is when a larger black hole

00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:49.720
 eats up all the stuff that's circling around

00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:51.520
 a smaller black hole.

00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:53.120
 And then those poor black holes

00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:54.840
 that have had their equipment stolen,

00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:56.360
 they just spiral off into space

00:08:56.360 --> 00:08:58.160
 and they're just bouncing around space.

00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:00.880
 Oh, it's thought maybe they bump into another black hole

00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:02.360
 to put it extremely crudely

00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:04.680
 in a way that an astronomer would faint at.

00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:07.720
 And yeah, they crash into another black hole

00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:09.120
 and they propelled away into space.

00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:10.960
 So there are lone black holes just

00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:12.160
 be looking for a mate.

00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:14.960
 But I think it's very cowboy-maveric black holes

00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:16.440
 who don't give a damn with any of the things

00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:19.360
 that are on the mission of vengeance to get that stuff back.

00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:22.400
 Yeah, there's sexy black holes.

00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:23.880
 Hey, why really like about this fact

00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:28.440
 is the massive hole-- sorry, the massive fail bit?

00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:30.360
 So what I love is the massive fail thing.

00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:33.200
 Because astronomers have a really good sense of humor.

00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:36.560
 There's a lot of jokes and a lot of just little acronym

00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:37.920
 puns that happen.

00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:39.160
 I found a couple.

00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:41.720
 There's one that's called the collaboration between Australian

00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:45.000
 and Nippon for Gamma Ray Observatory in the Outback

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:46.840
 or Candaro.

00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:48.320
 Very nice.

00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:51.360
 There's the package for the interactive analysis

00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:54.600
 of line-amission or point of veil.

00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:56.160
 One word.

00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:56.680
 OK.

00:09:56.680 --> 00:09:57.280
 One to veil.

00:09:57.280 --> 00:09:58.120
 OK.

00:09:58.120 --> 00:09:59.160
 [LAUGHTER]

00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:01.120
 That's the top of the cloud.

00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:02.120
 There's another one.

00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:06.800
 There's a star that's been named after Vladimir Putin.

00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:09.720
 Unfortunately, it's been named by Ukrainian astronomers

00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:14.400
 who've named it Putin Hulio, or Hulow, which roughly translates

00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:15.760
 as Putin is a dickhead.

00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:18.520
 [LAUGHTER]

00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:19.920
 And that's a star in the sky.

00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:21.440
 It only costs $10 to do it.

00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:23.680
 But it's quite nice that it's Ukrainian astronomers

00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:24.920
 who officially did it.

00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:25.400
 They do.

00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:28.200
 They're famously in the astronomy circles.

00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:29.360
 Good with acronyms.

00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:30.360
 It's kind of like doctors.

00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:34.160
 So you go to big astronomy conferences.

00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:36.160
 And there's just all these presentations

00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:37.160
 that are based on acronyms.

00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:39.400
 So, yeah, I think there's poopsy, which

00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:42.360
 is phase one observing proposal system.

00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:48.560
 There's super-huge inter-ferometric telescope, which is--

00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:49.360
 SHIT.

00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:50.160
 SHIT.

00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:51.440
 It's shit, Glasgow.

00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:56.360
 I mean, probably if you're not more comfortable saying that.

00:10:56.360 --> 00:10:58.160
 Normally, when audiences are all shouting shit,

00:10:58.160 --> 00:10:59.360
 they're telling it to me.

00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:01.960
 [LAUGHTER]

00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:04.960
 There's this one that is absolutely pushing it too far.

00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:06.480
 So this is what it's called.

00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:09.760
 And this was a name for a workshop, a big astronomy conference.

00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:12.800
 And it was titled "Testing Astroparticle

00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:18.000
 with the New Gev Observations, Positrons, and Electrons,

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.720
 Identifying the Sources."

00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:22.200
 It's too long.

00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:25.120
 I forgot what the first letter was, because I know.

00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:27.120
 It's Tango in Paris.

00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:27.960
 Oh.

00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:28.800
 It's too long.

00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:31.880
 I imagine if someone got that.

00:11:31.880 --> 00:11:33.760
 You would have only had to have listened.

00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:36.760
 [LAUGHTER]

00:11:36.760 --> 00:11:37.760
 Oh, yeah.

00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:40.680
 Imagine the brain, the cause of it.

00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:44.200
 I've reached that conclusion.

00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:45.760
 So speaking of "Imagine the Brain,"

00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:48.880
 we should probably be talking black holes at the death

00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:51.400
 this week of Jim Bowen.

00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:52.400
 What is it?

00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:55.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.240
 No, Stephen Hawking, of course, very much into black holes.

00:11:58.240 --> 00:12:01.080
 Hawking radiation is what he's famous for, which

00:12:01.080 --> 00:12:03.640
 is the fact that black holes get smaller over time

00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:04.920
 by very, very small amounts.

00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:06.640
 And he discovered that.

00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:08.320
 He had quite a good sense of humor, didn't he?

00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:08.800
 Yeah.

00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:09.320
 I think.

00:12:09.320 --> 00:12:10.440
 Amazing guy, yeah.

00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:12.640
 His Tango in Paris joke didn't get down so well.

00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:13.640
 [LAUGHTER]

00:12:13.640 --> 00:12:14.360
 There's all this stuff.

00:12:14.360 --> 00:12:14.880
 I love those.

00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:17.800
 The official biography of him that came out in 2012

00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:21.120
 was by a lady called Kitty Ferguson, very good biography.

00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:22.600
 And she wrote in it that there was a rumor

00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:25.000
 that Hawking used to run over the toes of people

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:26.640
 who annoyed him.

00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:28.440
 And he would do it sort of subtly

00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:30.880
 as if he was just turning around or something like that.

00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:32.360
 And while she was writing the book,

00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:34.800
 because she had access to him and asked him the questions,

00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:37.440
 she said, is this true, this rumor that you do this?

00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:39.600
 And he said, it is a malicious rumor.

00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:41.120
 I'll run over to anyone who repeats it.

00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:44.440
 [LAUGHTER]

00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:47.080
 He was a wild wheelchair driver, though.

00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:50.080
 Like years ago, when he was able to do whatever he wanted

00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:51.080
 with his wheelchair.

00:12:51.080 --> 00:12:54.840
 And a colleague said that he used to show off a lot with his tricks.

00:12:54.840 --> 00:12:56.160
 So he used to do a lot of spins.

00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:58.320
 He used to drive his wheelchair incredibly fast.

00:12:58.320 --> 00:13:01.280
 He actually once broke his hip crashing into a wall

00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:04.400
 in a show off stunt that got out of hand.

00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:05.800
 Yeah.

00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:09.440
 So the time was trying to section of Stephen Hawking's stories,

00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:10.680
 basically, and things he'd done.

00:13:10.680 --> 00:13:12.680
 There was a time where he was appearing on News Night.

00:13:12.680 --> 00:13:14.120
 And he was in the pre-phase.

00:13:14.120 --> 00:13:16.320
 They were getting the studio ready for him

00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:17.720
 and they were setting up all the lights.

00:13:17.720 --> 00:13:20.920
 And one of the producers pulled out a lead for one of the lights

00:13:20.920 --> 00:13:23.040
 and Hawking immediately slumped over in his turn.

00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:25.920
 [LAUGHTER]

00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:31.400
 The producer absolutely freaks out.

00:13:31.400 --> 00:13:34.520
 [LAUGHTER]

00:13:34.520 --> 00:13:37.280
 Thinking he had killed Stephen Hawking.

00:13:37.280 --> 00:13:38.480
 Kept round off to get some up.

00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:42.200
 Came back a few minutes later, found him giggling and falling.

00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:43.200
 What a guy!

00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:47.000
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.760
 OK, it is time for fact number two.

00:13:49.760 --> 00:13:51.640
 And that is Chazinski.

00:13:51.640 --> 00:13:55.120
 My fact this week is that Levi Jeans are set on fire

00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:57.040
 before they're sold.

00:13:57.040 --> 00:14:00.400
 And this is specifically by Jeans.

00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:04.440
 One's with holes in them or like distressed bits on them,

00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:08.440
 like rips or bits that look cool.

00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:13.480
 And they've been on fire in the factory.

00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:14.480
 That's how they do this.

00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:17.440
 So there's been a lot of coverage lately

00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:20.320
 about how Levi is changing the way it distresses its jeans

00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:22.360
 because it's got new laser technology, which

00:14:22.360 --> 00:14:24.960
 allows it to make its jeans look really worn.

00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:27.680
 Just with lasers rather than by hand.

00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:31.120
 And yeah, if you fire a laser at Jeans, obviously,

00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:32.400
 it can set them on fire.

00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:35.440
 And that's how you get the effect of the holes in jeans.

00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:37.240
 And if you're going to believe by a factory,

00:14:37.240 --> 00:14:40.240
 or many Jeans factories also use kind of laser technology,

00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:41.800
 then it just smells of smoke all the time

00:14:41.800 --> 00:14:44.240
 because you're sort of setting Jeans on fire all the time.

00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:46.000
 But this is really good because the previous way

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.440
 they did it was really bad, basically, right?

00:14:48.440 --> 00:14:49.840
 Yeah, people having to do it.

00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:52.240
 Yeah, you basically had people getting a pair of jeans,

00:14:52.240 --> 00:14:55.320
 putting them on mannequins, and just scrubbing them with sandpaper

00:14:55.320 --> 00:14:57.920
 and with chemicals, and they get very sick.

00:14:57.920 --> 00:15:03.000
 I certainly would say put them on and set themselves on fire.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.680
 In 2014, there was a Japanese brand which,

00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:08.600
 to get their jeans distressed, they were called Zoo Jeans.

00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:11.480
 And they had jeans which lions, tigers, and bears

00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:13.680
 had attacked in a zoo.

00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:16.600
 They only made three pairs, but I don't really

00:15:16.600 --> 00:15:17.960
 think you want to wear those, do you?

00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:23.760
 Because once a bear has gotten the taste for those jeans.

00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:26.960
 It's true, it'll go in a mission of gene vengeance for you.

00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:28.520
 Well, it was so clear how they did it.

00:15:28.520 --> 00:15:31.400
 So they took old tires and giant rubber rings

00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:34.280
 and things that animals and zoos are given to play with.

00:15:34.280 --> 00:15:35.880
 They wrapped them in a sheet of denim,

00:15:35.880 --> 00:15:37.880
 gave them to the animals, animals went rip, rip, rip.

00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:40.800
 And then they took, as they said, the most fashionable remnants.

00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:43.560
 [LAUGHTER]

00:15:43.560 --> 00:15:45.960
 And they turned those into a pair of jeans.

00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:47.280
 Very cool.

00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:50.840
 Well, they also have got people to wear down jeans

00:15:50.840 --> 00:15:52.680
 for potential consumers.

00:15:52.680 --> 00:15:55.320
 So this is a Welsh denim label good here.

00:15:55.320 --> 00:16:00.160
 And they, in 2014, they hired 50 men to break in their jeans.

00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:02.920
 So they made, they hired all these men,

00:16:02.920 --> 00:16:06.000
 and they had to wear these jeans for six months non-stop.

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.120
 So wear them every single day, whatever they did.

00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:09.720
 And they weren't allowed to wash them.

00:16:09.720 --> 00:16:12.080
 And so there was, I read an interview with one of the guys.

00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:14.400
 He said he wore them every day for everything.

00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:16.240
 He played rugby in them.

00:16:16.240 --> 00:16:17.080
 And he cut to them.

00:16:17.080 --> 00:16:18.440
 So, you know, cooking spills.

00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:19.720
 He did carpentry in them.

00:16:19.720 --> 00:16:20.720
 He was a carpenter.

00:16:20.720 --> 00:16:21.320
 He sunbathe.

00:16:21.320 --> 00:16:22.560
 He cycled every day.

00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:24.560
 He sun-baved in them.

00:16:24.560 --> 00:16:25.600
 He did.

00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:28.240
 He did not get a good tan.

00:16:28.240 --> 00:16:30.400
 But then that's to kind of make them seem worn.

00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:32.080
 And then they were auctioned off.

00:16:32.080 --> 00:16:35.080
 And, you know, they got a few hundred pounds each for them.

00:16:35.080 --> 00:16:38.640
 A few hundred pounds for six months' work, though.

00:16:38.640 --> 00:16:39.160
 I don't know.

00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:41.480
 It's not a good rate, is it?

00:16:41.480 --> 00:16:45.280
 I hope the carpentry business worked out.

00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:49.120
 Apparently, if you wear jeans and you commit a crime,

00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:50.680
 they're kind of like a fingerprint.

00:16:50.680 --> 00:16:53.040
 The police can tell the jeans they wear.

00:16:53.040 --> 00:16:56.560
 And if they catch you on CCTV and the CCTV is good enough,

00:16:56.560 --> 00:16:58.880
 they have a unique wear pattern.

00:16:58.880 --> 00:17:00.880
 So, if you're caught on film, they can look at them.

00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:03.040
 And they can tell that these are the actual jeans

00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:04.280
 that were used in the robbery.

00:17:04.280 --> 00:17:06.360
 As in the specific pair.

00:17:06.360 --> 00:17:08.480
 Or they can tell that that was all he's wearing skinny jeans.

00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:10.800
 No, no, they can tell the actual pair.

00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:13.280
 So, like, let's say you have been playing rugby

00:17:13.280 --> 00:17:15.040
 and sunbathing in a pair of jeans,

00:17:15.040 --> 00:17:16.760
 or you've just been walking down the street.

00:17:16.760 --> 00:17:18.320
 They look slightly different.

00:17:18.320 --> 00:17:20.920
 And there are forensic people who can tell the difference

00:17:20.920 --> 00:17:22.200
 between what you've been doing

00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:24.400
 and can tell your jeans from someone else's jeans.

00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:25.240
 Wow.

00:17:25.240 --> 00:17:27.720
 What you should do is just have a pair of crime jeans.

00:17:27.720 --> 00:17:28.880
 Oh, yeah.

00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:29.880
 And when they're forensic, guys,

00:17:29.880 --> 00:17:31.800
 like I said, well, these jeans have only been used for crime.

00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:32.560
 We could.

00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:35.360
 And then you keep them in a drawer.

00:17:35.360 --> 00:17:38.680
 When you're out crime.

00:17:38.680 --> 00:17:42.680
 They can't be used as armour, jeans, in a way.

00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:45.640
 Because there was a guy in Pennsylvania a couple of years ago

00:17:45.640 --> 00:17:49.800
 whose strange wife attacked him with a box cutter

00:17:49.800 --> 00:17:51.640
 to his genitals.

00:17:51.640 --> 00:17:53.720
 But his jeans were so thick that they

00:17:53.720 --> 00:17:55.200
 stopped him from getting injured.

00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:56.200
 Wow.

00:17:56.200 --> 00:17:58.240
 It's a little tip for you.

00:17:58.240 --> 00:17:59.240
 A little tip?

00:17:59.240 --> 00:18:02.720
 A little tip?

00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:06.680
 That's all he lost in the fight.

00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:08.000
 Wow.

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:09.680
 Did it rebound off the cloth or did it--

00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:11.720
 Yes, so there was a rip in the jeans,

00:18:11.720 --> 00:18:14.600
 but she couldn't get through the jean fabric

00:18:14.600 --> 00:18:16.560
 because it was really thick in the crotch area.

00:18:16.560 --> 00:18:17.440
 Wow.

00:18:17.440 --> 00:18:18.200
 Handy.

00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:19.040
 Very.

00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:21.600
 There's sometimes the process of making jeans is quite intense.

00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:27.280
 So there's sometimes bakes, which to get that worn look.

00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:31.440
 They're repeatedly washed.

00:18:31.440 --> 00:18:33.080
 So they used to be sand blasted.

00:18:33.080 --> 00:18:35.120
 But the new way of doing it with lasers

00:18:35.120 --> 00:18:37.800
 is it takes 90 seconds, I think, to make a pair of jeans

00:18:37.800 --> 00:18:39.320
 look like it's been worn for a year.

00:18:39.320 --> 00:18:41.960
 Or is it used to take about half an hour?

00:18:41.960 --> 00:18:44.600
 But do you know why-- so this is all kind of technology

00:18:44.600 --> 00:18:47.040
 that Levi is at the forefront of?

00:18:47.040 --> 00:18:49.760
 But do you know what made them famous?

00:18:49.760 --> 00:18:51.320
 Why do we think they--

00:18:51.320 --> 00:18:53.240
 What made Levi's famous?

00:18:53.240 --> 00:18:54.560
 Yeah.

00:18:54.560 --> 00:18:55.560
 Early jeans.

00:18:55.560 --> 00:18:57.160
 Yeah, I thought they were like the first--

00:18:57.160 --> 00:18:58.680
 Levi Strauss made the first jeans.

00:18:58.680 --> 00:18:59.680
 Yeah.

00:18:59.680 --> 00:19:01.400
 So it didn't invent jeans.

00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:06.000
 What he invented was, you know, the weird bits of metal--

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:06.800
 The rivets?

00:19:06.800 --> 00:19:10.600
 The rivets in your jeans and that no one knows why the hell

00:19:10.600 --> 00:19:11.320
 they're there.

00:19:11.320 --> 00:19:13.000
 That's what Levi invented.

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:14.000
 So--

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:15.400
 That's what they're there to protect the genitals

00:19:15.400 --> 00:19:18.080
 from your estranged wife, which you can tell you.

00:19:18.080 --> 00:19:19.600
 Bizarrely, they didn't, because they

00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:22.280
 had to get rid of them specifically on the crotch.

00:19:22.280 --> 00:19:24.560
 Because if people were outdoors back in today,

00:19:24.560 --> 00:19:26.560
 leaning over a fire, they would suddenly

00:19:26.560 --> 00:19:28.400
 heap their genitals up.

00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:30.040
 That was the biggest complaint.

00:19:30.040 --> 00:19:32.200
 It was like, I was having a nice time by the fire

00:19:32.200 --> 00:19:36.040
 when my balls lit on fire.

00:19:36.040 --> 00:19:38.040
 But yeah, those metal bits actually keep them together.

00:19:38.040 --> 00:19:39.520
 And I've always wondered what they're for.

00:19:39.520 --> 00:19:42.160
 And they were invented in 1871 by a guy who

00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:43.960
 came to Levi Strauss who marketed them.

00:19:43.960 --> 00:19:45.080
 And they keep jeans together.

00:19:45.080 --> 00:19:47.080
 So jeans used to just fall apart before that,

00:19:47.080 --> 00:19:49.960
 because they didn't have that strengthening technology.

00:19:49.960 --> 00:19:51.120
 And that's what they did.

00:19:51.120 --> 00:19:53.560
 And they also put the tiny pointless pocket in,

00:19:53.560 --> 00:19:55.640
 which, you know, that pocket that's inside the pocket.

00:19:55.640 --> 00:19:56.760
 We know what that's for?

00:19:56.760 --> 00:19:57.280
 Yeah.

00:19:57.280 --> 00:19:59.000
 Yeah, it's for pocket watches, which

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:01.520
 haven't existed for about a century.

00:20:01.520 --> 00:20:03.200
 And yet, still they are in jeans.

00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:03.680
 OK.

00:20:03.680 --> 00:20:04.200
 Yeah.

00:20:04.200 --> 00:20:04.880
 That's good.

00:20:04.880 --> 00:20:06.720
 And really, I think the patent for it,

00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:08.680
 everyone assumes it's the denim, but it's actually

00:20:08.680 --> 00:20:11.320
 the rivets when they actually filed the patent.

00:20:11.320 --> 00:20:13.520
 That was the big thing that they were trademarking.

00:20:13.520 --> 00:20:14.000
 That's cool.

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:15.200
 Yeah.

00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:16.720
 This sort of stuff on lasers.

00:20:16.720 --> 00:20:17.240
 Oh, yeah.

00:20:17.240 --> 00:20:19.880
 And you know, the parrots have been flying through lasers

00:20:19.880 --> 00:20:22.160
 recently, because this is--

00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:24.760
 So scientists want to make better drones.

00:20:24.760 --> 00:20:26.680
 They want to make us work out technology

00:20:26.680 --> 00:20:28.360
 for how to fly better.

00:20:28.360 --> 00:20:31.240
 And so they've been investigating how birds fly.

00:20:31.240 --> 00:20:33.960
 And there was a study done, I think, last year.

00:20:33.960 --> 00:20:36.640
 But there was a study done that looked at the flight of a parrot.

00:20:36.640 --> 00:20:38.360
 But they needed to investigate exactly

00:20:38.360 --> 00:20:40.320
 how they flap their wings when they take off.

00:20:40.320 --> 00:20:43.520
 And so what they did was it was actually a parrot-let, which

00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:44.080
 I really like.

00:20:44.080 --> 00:20:45.680
 It's like a really tiny parrot.

00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:48.000
 But what they did is they had it fly

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:50.960
 through a bunch of aerosol particles in the air that

00:20:50.960 --> 00:20:53.920
 were then lit up with lasers, because they're so precise.

00:20:53.920 --> 00:20:56.640
 So then you can have the aerosol particles all illuminated.

00:20:56.640 --> 00:20:59.080
 And then the lasers kind of show what kind of wing

00:20:59.080 --> 00:21:00.280
 movements they're making.

00:21:00.280 --> 00:21:03.000
 And so they found out how birds' wings moves when they fly.

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:04.800
 And then we can use that in drone technology.

00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:07.400
 But what's quite sweet is that obviously going through lasers

00:21:07.400 --> 00:21:08.800
 is quite damaging for you.

00:21:08.800 --> 00:21:12.480
 So if you look it up, they designed tiny pairs of goggles

00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:15.920
 for the parrots to protect them from the lasers.

00:21:15.920 --> 00:21:18.080
 Parrotlets as well.

00:21:18.080 --> 00:21:19.080
 Parrotlets.

00:21:19.080 --> 00:21:20.720
 Yeah, so they're tiny little glasses.

00:21:20.720 --> 00:21:21.880
 Really tiny, yeah.

00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:24.160
 It's almost as sweet as not making a parrot fly

00:21:24.160 --> 00:21:25.280
 through a load of lasers.

00:21:25.280 --> 00:21:28.280
 [LAUGHTER]

00:21:28.280 --> 00:21:30.360
 I imagine Parrotlets would block children

00:21:30.360 --> 00:21:34.480
 with parrots with Hava La Sholda.

00:21:34.480 --> 00:21:35.040
 In person.

00:21:35.040 --> 00:21:38.080
 In person four.

00:21:38.080 --> 00:21:40.720
 OK, it is time for fact number three.

00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:43.240
 And that is my fact this week.

00:21:43.240 --> 00:21:46.920
 Thomas Edison tested over 1,600 different materials

00:21:46.920 --> 00:21:49.600
 to find the right filament for the inside of his light bulbs,

00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:52.400
 including fishing lines, cardboard,

00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:57.080
 and hairs from the red beard of an old friend.

00:21:57.080 --> 00:21:59.440
 Imagine if that had been the most successful as well.

00:21:59.440 --> 00:22:00.280
 Yeah.

00:22:00.280 --> 00:22:02.480
 All light bulbs would have to be full of red beard here by now.

00:22:02.480 --> 00:22:03.800
 It did turn on.

00:22:03.800 --> 00:22:06.200
 It would be excellent for the economy of Scotland.

00:22:06.200 --> 00:22:07.200
 It would be good.

00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:10.400
 [LAUGHTER]

00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:11.680
 A risky comment.

00:22:11.680 --> 00:22:14.160
 [LAUGHTER]

00:22:14.160 --> 00:22:18.160
 Yeah, so this is one of those stories that

00:22:18.160 --> 00:22:20.360
 is Thomas Edison as a character.

00:22:20.360 --> 00:22:25.440
 So clouded in apocryphal stories and legends and so on.

00:22:25.440 --> 00:22:28.040
 But this was reported in a number of official biographies

00:22:28.040 --> 00:22:28.720
 by him.

00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:30.920
 But the story goes that they were trying

00:22:30.920 --> 00:22:32.960
 to work out how to make the light bulbs

00:22:32.960 --> 00:22:34.800
 of the original light bulb he was doing

00:22:34.800 --> 00:22:37.120
 last longer than a few hours or so on.

00:22:37.120 --> 00:22:38.400
 That was-- they had a limit on it.

00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:41.960
 And he tried over supposedly 1,600 things.

00:22:41.960 --> 00:22:44.000
 And when it was 1,600 things, it would be like--

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:46.760
 they used like 40 different varieties of bamboo.

00:22:46.760 --> 00:22:48.960
 So that would be part of the list, for example.

00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:50.720
 There wasn't completely random things,

00:22:50.720 --> 00:22:53.120
 like ripping beards off and so on.

00:22:53.120 --> 00:22:56.280
 But one of the stories from an official biography

00:22:56.280 --> 00:22:58.480
 says that a friend of his of old days, who

00:22:58.480 --> 00:23:01.080
 was his boss at a station, at a railroad station,

00:23:01.080 --> 00:23:02.440
 that he worked at when he was younger,

00:23:02.440 --> 00:23:04.480
 called Mr. McKenzie, came in.

00:23:04.480 --> 00:23:05.760
 He was a really fun character.

00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:07.840
 And Edison, as a joke, said, why don't we

00:23:07.840 --> 00:23:09.000
 try it with your red beard?

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:10.640
 Took off the strands, put it in.

00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:11.480
 It did go up.

00:23:11.480 --> 00:23:13.760
 And it had a red light, as it went up as well, which

00:23:13.760 --> 00:23:15.880
 was nice, yeah.

00:23:15.880 --> 00:23:17.320
 And yeah, so--

00:23:17.320 --> 00:23:18.520
 Actually, when they did that, there

00:23:18.520 --> 00:23:20.360
 was a competition between McKenzie

00:23:20.360 --> 00:23:22.600
 and another guy called John Creucey.

00:23:22.600 --> 00:23:24.480
 And they wanted to have a competition whose beard

00:23:24.480 --> 00:23:26.280
 would be best inside the--

00:23:26.280 --> 00:23:26.880
 Oh, really?

00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:27.560
 Yeah.

00:23:27.560 --> 00:23:32.000
 And Creucey, he was Swiss, and he had a big black bushy beard.

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:33.880
 McKenzie was more bristly and straight,

00:23:33.880 --> 00:23:35.200
 and they had a competition.

00:23:35.200 --> 00:23:37.200
 And McKenzie was the winner.

00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:41.240
 But actually, they were both pretty shit.

00:23:41.240 --> 00:23:43.520
 What was the thing that won, excuse my ignorance,

00:23:43.520 --> 00:23:45.760
 and out of these 1600 things, was it the--

00:23:45.760 --> 00:23:48.080
 Well, now we use what tungsten or something, don't we?

00:23:48.080 --> 00:23:48.680
 Oh, yeah.

00:23:48.680 --> 00:23:50.160
 But it was bamboo at the time.

00:23:50.160 --> 00:23:53.160
 Wasn't it-- oh, sort of a bamboo film, I think, was what he is.

00:23:53.160 --> 00:23:55.280
 So it was bamboo to start off with.

00:23:55.280 --> 00:23:59.000
 He found Japanese bamboo, and he sent a team of explorers

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:02.200
 to South America, and they found some really good bamboo.

00:24:02.200 --> 00:24:04.600
 But then they got confused, and they forgot where they found it.

00:24:04.600 --> 00:24:06.560
 So they brought some back, but they couldn't remember

00:24:06.560 --> 00:24:08.160
 where they got it from.

00:24:08.160 --> 00:24:11.760
 So then he had to send another guy called James Recalton

00:24:11.760 --> 00:24:13.800
 out to the jungles around the world, actually.

00:24:13.800 --> 00:24:16.200
 Sri Lanka, Burma, Malaysia, India, all over.

00:24:16.200 --> 00:24:20.280
 For a year, he looked around for the best perfect bamboo.

00:24:20.280 --> 00:24:22.320
 And he got to Sri Lanka, and he found this bamboo.

00:24:22.320 --> 00:24:25.440
 It was amazing, and it was going to be perfect for the light bulb.

00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:28.080
 And he got home to Edison, and he said, I've got this bamboo.

00:24:28.080 --> 00:24:30.320
 And Edison said, oh, we're using carbon now.

00:24:30.320 --> 00:24:31.320
 Oh.

00:24:31.320 --> 00:24:32.320
 Oh.

00:24:32.320 --> 00:24:34.840
 And then carbon was the final thing that he used.

00:24:34.840 --> 00:24:36.800
 That's really harsh.

00:24:36.800 --> 00:24:38.120
 Yeah, it's quite funny though.

00:24:38.120 --> 00:24:40.520
 You could at least have said, oh, thank you.

00:24:40.520 --> 00:24:41.440
 This looks great.

00:24:41.440 --> 00:24:41.960
 Thank you.

00:24:41.960 --> 00:24:42.560
 Great.

00:24:42.560 --> 00:24:46.640
 And then, quietly, he said, we're going to use the carbon.

00:24:46.640 --> 00:24:48.960
 I'd like to have a few days of thinking he'd won.

00:24:48.960 --> 00:24:50.640
 The amazing thing about the carbon, actually,

00:24:50.640 --> 00:24:54.360
 that was invented by a guy called Lewis Howard Latimer.

00:24:54.360 --> 00:24:57.080
 And he was an African-American drassman

00:24:57.080 --> 00:24:58.920
 who was a son of an escaped slave.

00:24:58.920 --> 00:25:01.000
 But the amazing thing about him is he

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:04.080
 invented the carbon filament, which made Edison's millions.

00:25:04.080 --> 00:25:07.320
 But he was also the drassman who drew up the patent

00:25:07.320 --> 00:25:09.960
 for Alexander Graham Bell's telephone.

00:25:09.960 --> 00:25:10.480
 Wow.

00:25:10.480 --> 00:25:12.840
 So he's made those two massive things.

00:25:12.840 --> 00:25:15.440
 The big rivalry.

00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:18.880
 But his light bulb was obviously very revolutionary,

00:25:18.880 --> 00:25:21.520
 even though he didn't technically invent the light bulb.

00:25:21.520 --> 00:25:25.200
 But I guess he was extremely good at PR, Edison.

00:25:25.200 --> 00:25:27.760
 So he had this invention factory, which

00:25:27.760 --> 00:25:30.280
 made sure they turned out the best inventions.

00:25:30.280 --> 00:25:35.960
 And one good PR move he made was in 1884 on Halloween.

00:25:35.960 --> 00:25:39.720
 So employees of the Edison Electric Lighting Company,

00:25:39.720 --> 00:25:41.480
 they paraded up and down New York

00:25:41.480 --> 00:25:43.520
 with light bulbs strapped to their heads.

00:25:43.520 --> 00:25:44.360
 So they all had to--

00:25:44.360 --> 00:25:46.440
 Everyone thought they were having an amazing idea.

00:25:46.440 --> 00:25:48.880
 [LAUGHTER]

00:25:48.880 --> 00:25:51.160
 Maybe that's where that came from.

00:25:51.160 --> 00:25:52.160
 But yeah, this is amazing.

00:25:52.160 --> 00:25:53.720
 It was a show off the new light bulbs, which

00:25:53.720 --> 00:25:54.800
 had just been invented.

00:25:54.800 --> 00:25:57.480
 And there was a huge horse-drawn generator

00:25:57.480 --> 00:25:58.920
 in the middle of all these hundreds

00:25:58.920 --> 00:26:01.760
 of employees of the factory, horse-drawn generator,

00:26:01.760 --> 00:26:04.440
 which changed steam into electricity.

00:26:04.440 --> 00:26:06.080
 So there's this big kind of steam powered machine

00:26:06.080 --> 00:26:06.760
 in the middle.

00:26:06.760 --> 00:26:09.040
 And then hundreds of people who were held together

00:26:09.040 --> 00:26:11.400
 with wire that was going from the light bulbs

00:26:11.400 --> 00:26:13.400
 on their heads and down through their sleeves

00:26:13.400 --> 00:26:15.240
 and then linking them to the next person.

00:26:15.240 --> 00:26:18.160
 So kind of like, there's gloves that you wore as a child

00:26:18.160 --> 00:26:20.600
 that connected to each other through your chest.

00:26:20.600 --> 00:26:22.600
 Oh, yeah, what?

00:26:22.600 --> 00:26:23.680
 Yeah, missions.

00:26:23.680 --> 00:26:25.080
 No, I mean around your chest.

00:26:25.080 --> 00:26:28.600
 [LAUGHTER]

00:26:28.600 --> 00:26:30.480
 But yeah, they paraded through New York.

00:26:30.480 --> 00:26:32.160
 And it was this huge PR thing in the face.

00:26:32.160 --> 00:26:34.680
 All these people tied together with light bulbs

00:26:34.680 --> 00:26:35.720
 flashing on their heads.

00:26:35.720 --> 00:26:38.200
 So sorry, were they tied together because it was one chain?

00:26:38.200 --> 00:26:38.720
 Yes.

00:26:38.720 --> 00:26:39.680
 It was one circuit.

00:26:39.680 --> 00:26:41.960
 Imagine if one of them had gone like in Christmas lights,

00:26:41.960 --> 00:26:45.440
 and you'd go to testing every individual employee.

00:26:45.440 --> 00:26:46.440
 No.

00:26:46.440 --> 00:26:49.480
 [LAUGHTER]

00:26:49.480 --> 00:26:52.680
 He used to do-- so for ideas, he used to do this thing.

00:26:52.680 --> 00:26:55.120
 And this again, it's been written in a bunch of biographies.

00:26:55.120 --> 00:26:56.680
 And a lot of people think that this really happened.

00:26:56.680 --> 00:26:58.080
 We're not sure.

00:26:58.080 --> 00:26:59.720
 He used to, when he was falling asleep,

00:26:59.720 --> 00:27:01.920
 he thought that's when he had his best ideas.

00:27:01.920 --> 00:27:03.760
 And he would think, I would have the idea.

00:27:03.760 --> 00:27:06.000
 And then I'd fall asleep, and I'd wake up later and go,

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:07.680
 oh, what was that amazing idea?

00:27:07.680 --> 00:27:10.920
 So he used to take naps during the day on a chair.

00:27:10.920 --> 00:27:13.160
 And in his hand, he would hold metallic balls,

00:27:13.160 --> 00:27:16.160
 just two metal balls, with a metal plate underneath him.

00:27:16.160 --> 00:27:18.880
 So as he was going into that zone where he was having an idea

00:27:18.880 --> 00:27:21.680
 as he was going into a nap, his hand would go loose

00:27:21.680 --> 00:27:22.960
 when he fell into the sleep.

00:27:22.960 --> 00:27:25.440
 The ball would land in the plate, wake him up,

00:27:25.440 --> 00:27:28.000
 and he could immediately go, ah, that idea is amazing,

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:29.880
 and write it down, and have it.

00:27:29.880 --> 00:27:32.640
 And no one's officially said that that's definitely

00:27:32.640 --> 00:27:34.280
 the case of how he did that.

00:27:34.280 --> 00:27:36.960
 But there's a famous statue in Florida of him,

00:27:36.960 --> 00:27:38.320
 which people always go and visit.

00:27:38.320 --> 00:27:41.160
 And in his hand is a metal ball, which

00:27:41.160 --> 00:27:44.440
 gives a little nod to the fact that they think it was true.

00:27:44.440 --> 00:27:45.440
 That's cool.

00:27:45.440 --> 00:27:47.040
 Yeah, he was famous for taking naps,

00:27:47.040 --> 00:27:50.120
 because he said that sleep was rubbish,

00:27:50.120 --> 00:27:51.200
 and no one needed that much.

00:27:51.200 --> 00:27:52.960
 And he said he only had three hours sleep a night.

00:27:52.960 --> 00:27:55.000
 But there were all these photos of him with Henry Ford,

00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:56.880
 who was one of his best friends of Ford fame.

00:27:56.880 --> 00:28:00.840
 There were all these photos of him sleep.

00:28:00.840 --> 00:28:03.360
 Henry Ford's really often awake, and he's just having a nap

00:28:03.360 --> 00:28:06.560
 in the background, just like constant catnaps.

00:28:06.560 --> 00:28:08.120
 And they work close him and Henry Ford.

00:28:08.120 --> 00:28:09.680
 They were super close, yeah.

00:28:09.680 --> 00:28:12.240
 It's like proper BFFs for life.

00:28:12.240 --> 00:28:13.600
 They went on camping trips together.

00:28:13.600 --> 00:28:14.600
 Yeah.

00:28:14.600 --> 00:28:17.680
 They went-- so Edison became confined to a wheelchair

00:28:17.680 --> 00:28:21.000
 in his later life, and Ford bought a wheelchair for himself,

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:22.880
 so they could have wheelchair races.

00:28:22.880 --> 00:28:24.160
 Yeah, no way.

00:28:24.160 --> 00:28:25.880
 Yeah, that's pretty sweet.

00:28:25.880 --> 00:28:28.200
 And there's a thing which is quite famous,

00:28:28.200 --> 00:28:30.000
 but maybe a lot of people haven't heard, which

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:33.400
 was when he died, they captured.

00:28:33.400 --> 00:28:34.520
 They were said to do this.

00:28:34.520 --> 00:28:37.640
 And it was handed over to Henry Ford by Edison's son,

00:28:37.640 --> 00:28:39.800
 the last breath of Thomas Edison.

00:28:39.800 --> 00:28:41.560
 So they had these little test tubes.

00:28:41.560 --> 00:28:43.840
 And there was eight of them that were sitting along there.

00:28:43.840 --> 00:28:45.000
 Breathe this last breath.

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:47.040
 They put in the cork afterwards.

00:28:47.040 --> 00:28:49.480
 And if you go to this day to the Henry Ford museum,

00:28:49.480 --> 00:28:51.560
 he has the test tube on display.

00:28:51.560 --> 00:28:55.600
 But yeah, you don't know which is going to be the last breath.

00:28:55.600 --> 00:28:57.560
 They must've been said that for a long time.

00:28:57.560 --> 00:28:58.520
 Yeah.

00:28:58.520 --> 00:28:59.640
 For months, maybe.

00:28:59.640 --> 00:29:01.600
 You just wait that they wait for the test tube

00:29:01.600 --> 00:29:03.240
 and say, here's the last--

00:29:03.240 --> 00:29:05.640
 the second last breath of the day, all right.

00:29:05.640 --> 00:29:06.960
 The third last breath.

00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:08.360
 Final test tube.

00:29:08.360 --> 00:29:09.680
 Yeah, I don't know.

00:29:09.680 --> 00:29:11.320
 It's impossible.

00:29:11.320 --> 00:29:12.480
 It's in a museum.

00:29:12.480 --> 00:29:13.320
 Yeah.

00:29:13.320 --> 00:29:15.000
 This won't go in, but I'll just quickly say it

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:16.320
 because I read it today.

00:29:16.320 --> 00:29:18.520
 I read the last words of Rol Dahl.

00:29:18.520 --> 00:29:21.840
 And Rol Dahl's last words, he was surrounded by his family.

00:29:21.840 --> 00:29:22.720
 He was very ill.

00:29:22.720 --> 00:29:26.120
 And his final words were, the thing I'm

00:29:26.120 --> 00:29:28.440
 going to miss most is being with all of you.

00:29:28.440 --> 00:29:29.320
 I was his final words.

00:29:29.320 --> 00:29:31.320
 And then he went down, except it wasn't quite

00:29:31.320 --> 00:29:33.120
 his last words, because the nurse who

00:29:33.120 --> 00:29:35.320
 was with him thought, I'll make it easy on him

00:29:35.320 --> 00:29:38.760
 and gave him a shot of morphine to make it go easy on the way out.

00:29:38.760 --> 00:29:42.680
 But as she did it, he went, oh, fuck!

00:29:42.680 --> 00:29:44.520
 And those were Rol Dahl's last words.

00:29:44.520 --> 00:29:47.680
 It's brilliant.

00:29:47.680 --> 00:29:50.040
 OK, it is time for our final fact of the show.

00:29:50.040 --> 00:29:52.240
 And that is Andrew Hunter Murray.

00:29:52.240 --> 00:29:55.040
 My fact is that it's only worth leaning over to pick up

00:29:55.040 --> 00:29:59.680
 a 1P coin if you can do it in less than three seconds.

00:29:59.680 --> 00:30:00.560
 Anything more than that?

00:30:00.560 --> 00:30:01.400
 Waste of time.

00:30:01.400 --> 00:30:02.560
 Move on.

00:30:02.560 --> 00:30:04.040
 I reckon I could do it in that time.

00:30:04.040 --> 00:30:05.200
 I'm sure you could.

00:30:05.200 --> 00:30:07.360
 I'm sure you could.

00:30:07.360 --> 00:30:09.800
 But you'd have to do it pretty much every three seconds

00:30:09.800 --> 00:30:12.560
 for it to be worth me giving up my job.

00:30:12.560 --> 00:30:13.240
 You would.

00:30:13.240 --> 00:30:14.240
 Yes, yeah.

00:30:14.240 --> 00:30:17.720
 This basically applies if you're on the median UK salary,

00:30:17.720 --> 00:30:20.720
 which is £539 a week.

00:30:20.720 --> 00:30:26.240
 And if you do that, assuming you work a 40-hour week,

00:30:26.240 --> 00:30:29.320
 9 to 6 with an hour for lunch, let's say,

00:30:29.320 --> 00:30:31.720
 you've got 2.6 seconds to do it.

00:30:31.720 --> 00:30:32.240
 OK.

00:30:32.240 --> 00:30:35.800
 Now, the problem is, if you are more than that, obviously,

00:30:35.800 --> 00:30:38.320
 you have to do it a lot faster to make an economical exercise

00:30:38.320 --> 00:30:39.080
 for you.

00:30:39.080 --> 00:30:42.720
 So the Prime Minister, based on her current salary,

00:30:42.720 --> 00:30:45.600
 I have assumed the 60-hour week for her, because she is busy.

00:30:45.600 --> 00:30:52.160
 But I haven't given her an hour for lunch, don't worry.

00:30:52.160 --> 00:30:55.960
 She would have to do it in 0.5 seconds, which is quite hard.

00:30:55.960 --> 00:30:57.200
 That's tough.

00:30:57.200 --> 00:31:00.160
 I've worked it out for Cristiano Ronaldo as well.

00:31:00.160 --> 00:31:04.680
 On his current salary, he would have to do it in 0.0.2 seconds.

00:31:04.680 --> 00:31:09.520
 And he would have to pick up 391 every second to make it work as well.

00:31:09.520 --> 00:31:11.080
 He is quick, though.

00:31:11.080 --> 00:31:12.040
 He is quick.

00:31:12.040 --> 00:31:12.640
 Yeah.

00:31:12.640 --> 00:31:16.920
 I worked it out for Philip Hammond, based on his independent

00:31:16.920 --> 00:31:18.640
 article that estimated his income.

00:31:18.640 --> 00:31:20.320
 So this is not just his salary.

00:31:20.320 --> 00:31:22.360
 It's all of the money that comes in for him.

00:31:22.360 --> 00:31:26.040
 And he would have to be able to pick it up in 0.2 seconds,

00:31:26.040 --> 00:31:29.600
 which is, coincidentally, the limit of human reaction time.

00:31:29.600 --> 00:31:34.960
 So he would have to immediately notice it, pick it up without any movement,

00:31:34.960 --> 00:31:37.680
 just notice it, pick it up, notice it, pick it up.

00:31:37.680 --> 00:31:40.600
 Basically, that's the fastest anyone can possibly pick up coins.

00:31:40.600 --> 00:31:41.800
 I reckon, wow.

00:31:41.800 --> 00:31:45.000
 But if he did that, he really would not be getting on with the job,

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:46.920
 but he-- and it is an important job he's got.

00:31:46.920 --> 00:31:49.240
 I would say he should focus on being Chancellor,

00:31:49.240 --> 00:31:52.280
 and then leave the coin picking to Theresa May.

00:31:52.280 --> 00:31:54.960
 [LAUGHTER]

00:31:54.960 --> 00:31:56.800
 Maybe that's what she's been doing.

00:31:56.800 --> 00:31:59.920
 It's a strong plan for Brexit Britain, because it's

00:31:59.920 --> 00:32:01.640
 looking for any coins we can find.

00:32:01.640 --> 00:32:04.240
 [LAUGHTER]

00:32:04.240 --> 00:32:06.000
 We've got no trade deals, but has anyone

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:07.240
 looked behind the sofa?

00:32:07.240 --> 00:32:09.680
 [LAUGHTER]

00:32:09.680 --> 00:32:16.440
 But this is partly about how the 1P is silly,

00:32:16.440 --> 00:32:18.200
 but it's not worth very much at all.

00:32:18.200 --> 00:32:21.040
 And there's a lot of talk of getting rid of it, right?

00:32:21.040 --> 00:32:25.120
 So I think it's basically not worth picking it up at any point.

00:32:25.120 --> 00:32:30.560
 You're not even allowed to pay with 1P's in more than 20 1P's.

00:32:30.560 --> 00:32:32.040
 So I--

00:32:32.040 --> 00:32:34.760
 So if something's 22P, you can't pay with just 1P's.

00:32:34.760 --> 00:32:37.320
 Yeah, and I've broken the law on multiple occasions.

00:32:37.320 --> 00:32:40.160
 Well, it's not a law, per se.

00:32:40.160 --> 00:32:42.440
 It's that they don't have to accept it as legal tender.

00:32:42.440 --> 00:32:43.200
 Yes.

00:32:43.200 --> 00:32:45.880
 But if you're in one of those self-service places,

00:32:45.880 --> 00:32:48.280
 and you can just put them in really quickly before they notice,

00:32:48.280 --> 00:32:50.480
 then you can do as many as you want, actually.

00:32:50.480 --> 00:32:53.440
 So yeah, there is an idea of getting rid of the 1P's and the 2P's.

00:32:53.440 --> 00:32:55.320
 And I think Jar Jarzban wanted to do it.

00:32:55.320 --> 00:32:56.400
 Didn't he when he was Chancellor?

00:32:56.400 --> 00:32:58.320
 But David Cameron said we shouldn't,

00:32:58.320 --> 00:33:01.360
 because everyone all voters out.

00:33:01.360 --> 00:33:04.320
 And the amount of money you pay to make them

00:33:04.320 --> 00:33:06.920
 is more than what they're worth.

00:33:06.920 --> 00:33:10.720
 It's something like six out of 10 UK 1P and 2P's

00:33:10.720 --> 00:33:13.600
 are only used once and then put in a jar.

00:33:13.600 --> 00:33:17.880
 And then 1 in 12, the kinds of thrown into the bin immediately.

00:33:17.880 --> 00:33:19.240
 And at one stage, the role meant

00:33:19.240 --> 00:33:21.880
 was having to make 500 million 1P and 2P

00:33:21.880 --> 00:33:25.320
 coins every year to replace those were going out of circulation.

00:33:25.320 --> 00:33:28.720
 I do not believe anyone throws 1P coins into the bin.

00:33:28.720 --> 00:33:31.920
 Does anyone here throw coins just into the bin?

00:33:31.920 --> 00:33:33.920
 What it's 12 people do, so--

00:33:33.920 --> 00:33:36.960
 No, in a charity box or into a jar.

00:33:36.960 --> 00:33:38.360
 Straight in the bin.

00:33:38.360 --> 00:33:40.520
 No, it's not maniac.

00:33:40.520 --> 00:33:41.600
 But I've been tempted.

00:33:41.600 --> 00:33:43.080
 It's completely insane, man.

00:33:43.080 --> 00:33:45.160
 OK, so did you say 500 million a year?

00:33:45.160 --> 00:33:45.640
 Yeah.

00:33:45.640 --> 00:33:50.160
 Guess how many pennies the UK made in the year 1933?

00:33:50.160 --> 00:33:51.160
 Cut.

00:33:51.160 --> 00:33:54.720
 It's the worst game show ever.

00:33:54.720 --> 00:33:55.760
 A billion.

00:33:55.760 --> 00:33:57.600
 Seven.

00:33:57.600 --> 00:33:59.560
 How are we so close?

00:33:59.560 --> 00:34:02.240
 They made seven pennies for the whole year.

00:34:02.240 --> 00:34:03.040
 What?

00:34:03.040 --> 00:34:04.000
 Why did they do that?

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:06.200
 Because they had loads already hit us.

00:34:06.200 --> 00:34:07.920
 So these are seven.

00:34:07.920 --> 00:34:09.840
 But seven is a strange number, isn't it?

00:34:09.840 --> 00:34:10.800
 You would think zero.

00:34:10.800 --> 00:34:13.320
 Why would you need so more?

00:34:13.320 --> 00:34:15.280
 Get the machines back up and running.

00:34:15.280 --> 00:34:18.640
 Does anyone have seven P?

00:34:18.640 --> 00:34:20.000
 OK, the reason for it was

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:21.800
 because I think the men didn't want to miss a year.

00:34:21.800 --> 00:34:23.520
 They didn't want to have a year in which they did not make

00:34:23.520 --> 00:34:25.080
 one of the coins at the realm.

00:34:25.080 --> 00:34:26.120
 So they made seven--

00:34:26.120 --> 00:34:26.960
 Oh, wait a minute.

00:34:26.960 --> 00:34:28.120
 They must be really rare.

00:34:28.120 --> 00:34:28.960
 That's so rare.

00:34:28.960 --> 00:34:31.800
 So this is even rare, because three of them

00:34:31.800 --> 00:34:33.880
 were placed by the king under the foundation

00:34:33.880 --> 00:34:36.240
 stones of important buildings, OK?

00:34:36.240 --> 00:34:39.240
 Two went to the British Museum, two went into private hands.

00:34:39.240 --> 00:34:41.080
 What's buildings do we know what they are?

00:34:41.080 --> 00:34:41.680
 I don't know.

00:34:41.680 --> 00:34:44.040
 I think it probably is known.

00:34:44.040 --> 00:34:46.680
 There are four prototypes coins as well.

00:34:46.680 --> 00:34:51.800
 One of those in 2016 sold for 72,000 pounds.

00:34:51.800 --> 00:34:52.320
 Wow.

00:34:52.320 --> 00:34:54.760
 They're so rare that people start modifying

00:34:54.760 --> 00:34:57.840
 a 1935 coins, because they can most easily be adapted

00:34:57.840 --> 00:35:00.680
 and made to look like a 33 penny.

00:35:00.680 --> 00:35:04.600
 So if you do find one of those, do hang on to it.

00:35:04.600 --> 00:35:07.960
 They used to, in the eighth century, they had pennies,

00:35:07.960 --> 00:35:10.040
 but they didn't have-- because things would cost less

00:35:10.040 --> 00:35:10.960
 than a penny.

00:35:10.960 --> 00:35:12.640
 So what they ended up doing was just they

00:35:12.640 --> 00:35:14.160
 would chop the pennies in half.

00:35:14.160 --> 00:35:15.400
 So if you were at a shop, you'd be like,

00:35:15.400 --> 00:35:16.160
 I need some change.

00:35:16.160 --> 00:35:18.000
 And they would just slice your penny into

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:20.760
 and give you either the quarter of a half that they--

00:35:20.760 --> 00:35:22.920
 We had pennies as well, didn't we, half pennies?

00:35:22.920 --> 00:35:23.920
 Yeah.

00:35:23.920 --> 00:35:25.320
 Sorry, pennies were--

00:35:25.320 --> 00:35:27.000
 they came about from the chopping in half.

00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:29.920
 And actually, the design of coins in that period,

00:35:29.920 --> 00:35:31.320
 like the eighth century, around--

00:35:31.320 --> 00:35:35.280
 and then in the 1200s Henry II introduced

00:35:35.280 --> 00:35:37.040
 what was called the long cross coin.

00:35:37.040 --> 00:35:39.200
 And it was a coin where the cross figured on it,

00:35:39.200 --> 00:35:41.600
 the Christian cross, went probably from top to bottom

00:35:41.600 --> 00:35:42.640
 and from right to left.

00:35:42.640 --> 00:35:44.600
 And that was to make it easier to cut.

00:35:44.600 --> 00:35:46.440
 And so that was if you could give change,

00:35:46.440 --> 00:35:47.840
 you could give it more easily, because you could just

00:35:47.840 --> 00:35:48.680
 break it up.

00:35:48.680 --> 00:35:49.840
 And then that's where--

00:35:49.840 --> 00:35:51.200
 Actually, that's where pieces of eight

00:35:51.200 --> 00:35:52.160
 comes from as well, isn't it?

00:35:52.160 --> 00:35:53.040
 Oh, really?

00:35:53.040 --> 00:35:55.120
 Because you were saying before about piece of foreign,

00:35:55.120 --> 00:35:57.160
 whatever, the piece of eight was you would have a coin

00:35:57.160 --> 00:35:58.720
 and you would cut it into eight pieces.

00:35:58.720 --> 00:36:01.560
 And that's why a quarter is called two bits in America.

00:36:01.560 --> 00:36:03.040
 What have they made of?

00:36:03.040 --> 00:36:05.080
 That you could chop it so easily.

00:36:05.080 --> 00:36:06.080
 Metal.

00:36:06.080 --> 00:36:08.200
 Soft metals, specifically silver.

00:36:08.200 --> 00:36:09.880
 Silver and gold are quite soft, aren't they?

00:36:09.880 --> 00:36:10.600
 Yeah, exactly.

00:36:10.600 --> 00:36:11.600
 And this is--

00:36:11.600 --> 00:36:14.560
 That's why if you get a gold medal and you bite it,

00:36:14.560 --> 00:36:16.400
 to prove whether it's real gold on that,

00:36:16.400 --> 00:36:18.520
 to prove it's gold, it's not harder, it's softer.

00:36:18.520 --> 00:36:20.640
 So if you bite something that's made out of gold,

00:36:20.640 --> 00:36:22.480
 you should get little teeth marks in it.

00:36:22.480 --> 00:36:23.240
 Yeah.

00:36:23.240 --> 00:36:24.240
 OK.

00:36:24.240 --> 00:36:26.520
 Unless it leaves really big teeth marks, in which case,

00:36:26.520 --> 00:36:27.600
 it's a chocolate coin.

00:36:27.600 --> 00:36:28.120
 Yeah.

00:36:28.120 --> 00:36:31.120
 [LAUGHTER]

00:36:31.120 --> 00:36:32.280
 Don't be fooled again, Dan.

00:36:32.280 --> 00:36:35.520
 [LAUGHTER]

00:36:35.520 --> 00:36:37.000
 Just on that--

00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:39.600
 so people used to chop little bits off the edges of coins.

00:36:39.600 --> 00:36:40.920
 And that was a really bad crime.

00:36:40.920 --> 00:36:42.560
 And it had very severe punishments,

00:36:42.560 --> 00:36:44.680
 because obviously it's devaluing the coin on the realm.

00:36:44.680 --> 00:36:46.520
 But people used to do it anyway, because you

00:36:46.520 --> 00:36:48.760
 can melt down the silver and recast it.

00:36:48.760 --> 00:36:51.400
 And in 2015, again, a horde of silver clippings

00:36:51.400 --> 00:36:53.520
 was found in a field in Gloucestershire

00:36:53.520 --> 00:36:55.440
 by someone with a metal detector.

00:36:55.440 --> 00:36:59.080
 And it was a huge bundle of shaved off coins.

00:36:59.080 --> 00:37:00.760
 And I just love the name it's been given.

00:37:00.760 --> 00:37:02.960
 It was called the toenail horde.

00:37:02.960 --> 00:37:05.440
 Because it looks all these little round

00:37:05.440 --> 00:37:06.280
 trebings of coins.

00:37:06.280 --> 00:37:07.520
 They look like a tas of them.

00:37:07.520 --> 00:37:08.040
 That's amazing.

00:37:08.040 --> 00:37:10.760
 That's why coins have got milling on the side of it.

00:37:10.760 --> 00:37:13.480
 So little kind of indentations on the side of every coin,

00:37:13.480 --> 00:37:16.040
 if you look at it, that's to stop people from shaving off.

00:37:16.040 --> 00:37:18.880
 And that was invented by a think Isaac Newton, who

00:37:18.880 --> 00:37:21.240
 was the master of the mint, as well as doing all the other stuff

00:37:21.240 --> 00:37:22.240
 he did.

00:37:22.240 --> 00:37:23.800
 It's such a good name, isn't it?

00:37:23.800 --> 00:37:25.040
 Yeah.

00:37:25.040 --> 00:37:26.200
 Here's another idea.

00:37:26.200 --> 00:37:28.920
 Get rid of one piece, two piece, five piece, ten piece,

00:37:28.920 --> 00:37:30.080
 and 50 piece.

00:37:30.080 --> 00:37:35.240
 And instead have one piece, three piece, 11 piece, and 37 piece.

00:37:35.240 --> 00:37:37.120
 You've gone mad.

00:37:37.120 --> 00:37:37.760
 Yeah.

00:37:37.760 --> 00:37:39.080
 It's just maths, Andy.

00:37:39.080 --> 00:37:39.960
 It's just maths.

00:37:39.960 --> 00:37:42.640
 If you have those coins, then it makes it easier

00:37:42.640 --> 00:37:45.560
 for any kind of combination of coins

00:37:45.560 --> 00:37:48.960
 to be used for any number of any price, basically.

00:37:48.960 --> 00:37:49.960
 37 piece.

00:37:49.960 --> 00:37:52.840
 Yeah, because they're all prime numbers, so apart from one.

00:37:52.840 --> 00:37:55.400
 But they're all kind of prime numbers.

00:37:55.400 --> 00:37:56.920
 One's kind of a prime number, isn't it?

00:37:56.920 --> 00:37:59.880
 Oh, we're going to get somebody like that.

00:37:59.880 --> 00:38:03.960
 But basically, it means that say something's 76 p or 84 p,

00:38:03.960 --> 00:38:06.640
 it's just easier to work out with that specific number

00:38:06.640 --> 00:38:10.280
 of things. On average, it's 4.1 coins per transaction,

00:38:10.280 --> 00:38:12.520
 compared to 1p, 2p, and 5p and 7.

00:38:12.520 --> 00:38:14.240
 So there will be 37 p coins.

00:38:14.240 --> 00:38:15.800
 That's so hard to work out.

00:38:15.800 --> 00:38:17.760
 No, you get used to it pretty quick.

00:38:17.760 --> 00:38:20.040
 Now, if you had to learn your 37 times table,

00:38:20.040 --> 00:38:22.680
 just to pay for stuff.

00:38:22.680 --> 00:38:27.520
 You're the first person who introduced the penny to the UK.

00:38:27.520 --> 00:38:29.280
 So this is also in the 8th century.

00:38:29.280 --> 00:38:31.640
 And this is King Offer of Mercia.

00:38:31.640 --> 00:38:34.320
 So 8th century, he made the first penny in the UK.

00:38:34.320 --> 00:38:36.240
 And the incredible thing about this, which

00:38:36.240 --> 00:38:36.920
 I just love.

00:38:36.920 --> 00:38:38.720
 And I learn when I went to the British Museum.

00:38:38.720 --> 00:38:42.880
 And I saw an example of one of his early gold coins.

00:38:42.880 --> 00:38:43.480
 Is this?

00:38:43.480 --> 00:38:45.800
 So only three gold coins from his reign

00:38:45.800 --> 00:38:48.760
 survived, so the introduce of the penny to Britain.

00:38:48.760 --> 00:38:55.720
 And he was a Christian King and the phrase around this gold

00:38:55.720 --> 00:38:57.680
 coin in the British Museum is, there

00:38:57.680 --> 00:38:59.920
 is no God but Allah alone.

00:38:59.920 --> 00:39:00.840
 And it is because--

00:39:00.840 --> 00:39:01.640
 Oh.

00:39:01.640 --> 00:39:03.160
 It's so incredible.

00:39:03.160 --> 00:39:05.520
 So it was just a century after Muhammad, basically.

00:39:05.520 --> 00:39:09.880
 And the Abbasid Caliphs were taking over large parts of Europe.

00:39:09.880 --> 00:39:12.120
 And he wanted to be-- well, we're not entirely sure why

00:39:12.120 --> 00:39:12.800
 the coin said this.

00:39:12.800 --> 00:39:16.080
 But one theory is that he wanted to be able to trade with them.

00:39:16.080 --> 00:39:17.920
 And they would see these coins as valuable.

00:39:17.920 --> 00:39:20.000
 They would recognize that and think, yeah, you're one of us.

00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:21.200
 That's fine.

00:39:21.200 --> 00:39:22.880
 But then a lot of other people think, actually,

00:39:22.880 --> 00:39:24.240
 he just didn't speak Arabic.

00:39:24.240 --> 00:39:26.200
 And he had no idea what those words meant.

00:39:26.200 --> 00:39:27.320
 And he's a Christian King.

00:39:27.320 --> 00:39:28.640
 He accidentally wrote on his coins.

00:39:28.640 --> 00:39:29.960
 There's no God but Allah alone.

00:39:29.960 --> 00:39:33.760
 It's like a tattoo with some old kind of Japanese characters.

00:39:33.760 --> 00:39:38.240
 And it actually says, you English Winker.

00:39:38.240 --> 00:39:42.680
 Do you know what the least valuable coin in the world is?

00:39:42.680 --> 00:39:44.400
 It's an Uzbek coin.

00:39:44.400 --> 00:39:47.520
 And it's the one Tegan coin.

00:39:47.520 --> 00:39:50.960
 If you had 3,000 of them, you would have one penny.

00:39:50.960 --> 00:39:52.960
 That's an extreme way to use it as one penny.

00:39:52.960 --> 00:39:59.760
 And I worked out that Ronaldo, if he wanted to make a profit,

00:39:59.760 --> 00:40:03.720
 would have to pick up 1 million and 173,000

00:40:03.720 --> 00:40:07.080
 and Tegan every second.

00:40:07.080 --> 00:40:08.080
 He is fast, though.

00:40:08.080 --> 00:40:12.760
 OK, let's wrap up, guys.

00:40:12.760 --> 00:40:13.720
 OK, that is it.

00:40:13.720 --> 00:40:14.960
 That is all of our facts.

00:40:14.960 --> 00:40:16.360

00:40:29.680 --> 00:40:31.440
 Yep, or you can go to our group account, which

00:40:31.440 --> 00:40:33.840
 is @NoSuchThing, or our website.

00:40:33.840 --> 00:40:36.800
 NoSuchThing is a fish.com where we have all of our links

00:40:38.400 --> 00:40:40.320
 We have links to our book.

00:40:40.320 --> 00:40:42.600
 We also have a link-- actually, we don't do.

00:40:42.600 --> 00:40:45.920
 It's a very exclusive thing that we've got this tour cassette.

00:40:45.920 --> 00:40:47.680
 And we're about to give one away, actually,

00:40:47.680 --> 00:40:50.720
 to a member of the audience who sent an effect to us

00:40:50.720 --> 00:40:51.960
 at the beginning of the show.

00:40:51.960 --> 00:40:54.840
 So for a cassette, Andy, what's the winning fact?

00:40:54.840 --> 00:40:57.920
 The winning fact comes from someone called Julien Mazet.

00:40:57.920 --> 00:41:00.280
 I hope I'm pronouncing the name right, and it's this.

00:41:00.280 --> 00:41:01.360
 It's about the city we're in.

00:41:01.360 --> 00:41:04.240
 It's that Glasgow was once voted the friendliest

00:41:04.240 --> 00:41:08.800
 and the most dangerous city in the UK in the same year.

00:41:08.800 --> 00:41:18.520
 OK, that's it.

00:41:18.520 --> 00:41:19.800
 That is all of our facts.

00:41:19.800 --> 00:41:21.640
 Thank you so much, guys.

00:41:21.640 --> 00:41:22.480
 We'll see you again.

00:41:22.480 --> 00:41:23.280
 Goodbye.
