00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,480
 (ding, ding, ding)

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:04,840
 (speaking in foreign language)

3
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:07,600
 (ding, ding, ding, ding, ding)

4
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:11,240
 (speaking in foreign language)

5
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:13,960
 - Hello and welcome to another episode

6
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:15,880
 of "No Such Thing as a Fish",

7
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:18,640
 a weekly podcast this week coming to you live

8
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:19,760
 from Glasgow!

9
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:22,000
 (cheering)

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
 (audience cheering)

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,760
 My name is Dan Schreiber

12
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:33,000
 and I am sitting here with Andrew Hunter-Marie,

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,440
 Annatuzinski and James Harkin.

14
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:38,040
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones

15
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:41,080
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days

16
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:42,520
 and in no particular order.

17
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:45,680
 Here we go, starting with you, James.

18
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:47,360
 - Okay, my fact this week is,

19
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:51,400
 when a very large star quietly turns into a black hole

20
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:53,480
 without the usual explosion,

21
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:57,120
 the official term used by astronomers is a massive fail.

22
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:00,280
 (audience laughing)

23
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:02,720
 - A star, as if it wasn't embarrassed enough.

24
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:04,840
 It wasn't able to make the explosion.

25
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:07,840
 - Well, it turns out that about 30% of massive stars

26
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,880
 turn into massive fails.

27
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:11,680
 And they found this out quite recently.

28
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:14,080
 They were looking at an area of the universe

29
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,240
 called the Firework Galaxy,

30
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,120
 where there's loads of supernovas.

31
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:19,920
 So when it explodes, when you've got a big star

32
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,960
 and it explodes, it's called a supernova.

33
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:23,880
 And eventually that turns into a black hole,

34
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:26,160
 but sometimes it's happening without the supernova.

35
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:27,880
 And this area called the Firework Galaxy

36
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:29,920
 had loads of supernovas.

37
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:32,320
 But the work quite as many as they thought there should be,

38
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:33,800
 and they couldn't work out why.

39
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:38,800
 And then they were looking at a star called N6946-BH1.

40
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:43,560
 - My uncle's called that, so that's a nozzly name.

41
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:47,560
 - There's a prisoner number, isn't it?

42
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:50,560
 (audience laughing)

43
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:54,960
 When he's out in five years, you'll regret saying that.

44
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,440
 (audience laughing)

45
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:59,480
 And they noticed that it wasn't there anymore in it,

46
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:01,880
 it just kind of quietly dissipated.

47
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:02,840
 This is a thing that happens

48
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:05,800
 that they've only just found out in the last six months or so.

49
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:08,600
 - But I think massive fail is a really unfair way

50
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:12,000
 to characterize it, because so basically, yes,

51
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,480
 the way stars turn into black holes is,

52
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:18,000
 it was thought that they turn into a supernova, as you said,

53
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,960
 and so there's this huge explosion.

54
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:22,680
 And then they suddenly shrink into a black hole.

55
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,880
 But then these stars aren't doing the explosion,

56
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:28,480
 but that actually means that they don't blow away

57
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,720
 as much of the debris.

58
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:33,960
 So apparently supernova blow off a lot of the stars outer layers.

59
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:37,360
 And so therefore, there's not as much gravitational pull

60
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,080
 left to make a massive black hole.

61
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:42,960
 So actually, the massive fails make a massive hole,

62
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:45,400
 a bigger hole than the massive successes

63
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:48,520
 or whatever they call the supernova once.

64
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:51,160
 - I didn't know the black holes are not really holes.

65
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,960
 - Yeah, what did you think they were?

66
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,280
 - I thought they were holes.

67
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,120
 - Oh, yeah, of course.

68
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,120
 - I had the idea.

69
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,920
 (all laughing)

70
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,080
 - I could probably even firt that

71
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,480
 from your previous sense of the stuff.

72
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,480
 - I think I made it.

73
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:03,120
 (all laughing)

74
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:06,240
 - But they're not, they're not, they're the opposite of holes.

75
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:08,200
 Do you guys know this, black holes are the opposite of holes?

76
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,040
 - What's the opposite of a hole?

77
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,200
 - Like a sticky out thing.

78
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,200
 - Just a big bulge.

79
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,920
 - Well, yeah, they're really, really full.

80
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,520
 They're fuller than anything you've ever seen in your life,

81
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:18,920
 because they're so dense.

82
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:21,800
 So for example, so how much do they weigh?

83
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:24,160
 Okay, they could have a mass greater

84
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:26,480
 than 20 times the mass of our sun.

85
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:30,840
 And the really big ones can have a mass equal to four million

86
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:33,960
 suns, as they're the extremely large supermassive black holes.

87
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,960
 But they are everything crunched inwards.

88
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:36,800
 - Yeah.

89
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,120
 - So it's just like a very large body,

90
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:40,160
 which has been crunched down to a tiny size.

91
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,760
 - They could be any size really.

92
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:45,240
 Basically, it's the density that's the important thing.

93
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:47,040
 So you can have tiny ones, you can have massive ones.

94
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:47,880
 You could be a black hole.

95
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:50,840
 If I squash you down to the size of about a tenth,

96
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:52,920
 the size of a neutrino, you would be a black hole.

97
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:54,640
 - Okay, but you and me would fall out.

98
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,240
 (audience laughing)

99
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:59,600
 - If the earth got about as dense as a black hole,

100
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,560
 if you were crunching it down to the roughly the density

101
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:05,320
 of a black hole, it would be about the size of an eyeball.

102
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:07,440
 It would be about two centimeters across.

103
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:08,600
 - Wow.

104
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:09,600
 - That density.

105
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,440
 - And the whole point of it is,

106
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:14,760
 the gravity is so strong, light can't get out of there.

107
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,800
 You can't get to the escape velocity

108
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,640
 because light can only go at a certain speed.

109
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:20,040
 And so nothing can escape,

110
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:22,160
 because light is the fastest thing that there is.

111
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,400
 And if light can't get out, then nothing can.

112
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,680
 - Although, that's the thing about black holes

113
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,640
 has been challenged over the last few years, isn't it?

114
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:31,160
 And by Stephen Hawking, who, yeah.

115
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:33,360
 So it was assumed that black holes did have

116
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,560
 this strong gravitational pull

117
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:37,000
 that would mean that everything just disappeared into them.

118
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,680
 But it turns out they do what is referred to as a cosmic burp.

119
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:46,080
 And this apparently is when they consume so much,

120
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:49,240
 they overeat, they eat so much stuff

121
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:52,280
 that they're almost a force-fed huge amounts of gas

122
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:54,720
 and they can't swallow it all, so it's spits on back out.

123
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:55,560
 - That's amazing.

124
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:57,600
 It's really hard researching black holes,

125
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,120
 'cause I guess we don't really know fully what they are.

126
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,360
 It's all hypothetical.

127
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,720
 And as a result, they do stuff.

128
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,160
 All the headlines I was looking into

129
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:07,120
 is colorful language, like they burp stuff up.

130
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,960
 Or I read one that I got excited by,

131
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:12,920
 which was a black hole caught having a post-lunch nap

132
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:15,040
 after it eats solar system.

133
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,240
 And I was like, this is gonna be great.

134
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,960
 And then it was not.

135
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:21,240
 - What did you think it was going to be?

136
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,560
 When he said he was always gonna be great,

137
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,920
 did you think they were gonna describe the fold-out bed

138
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:27,760
 that they had all set up in their office?

139
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:28,600
 - I don't know.

140
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,600
 I clicked on it just optimistically not thinking anything.

141
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,440
 - Yeah.

142
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,520
 - So the stage before a black hole

143
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,960
 is a thing called a neutron star.

144
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,720
 So this is where a star collapses

145
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:39,360
 and it doesn't collapse with quite enough force

146
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,520
 to become a black hole,

147
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:42,360
 but it does become a thing called a neutron star,

148
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,760
 which is very, very, very dense,

149
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,240
 but not as dense as a black hole.

150
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:47,080
 So this is very cool.

151
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:52,080
 A sugar cube of neutron star would weigh on Earth a billion tons.

152
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,960
 - Yeah.

153
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:54,800
 - And?

154
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,760
 - It's hard to imagine what a billion tons is, isn't it, really?

155
00:05:56,760 --> 00:06:00,360
 - Yeah, it's like, imagine a billion one-ton elephants

156
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,480
 can I put it that way?

157
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,480
 (audience laughing)

158
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,320
 - Wow.

159
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:04,720
 - Yeah, exactly, right?

160
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:05,560
 - And.

161
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,360
 - So both of us, it's pretty difficult to pick up

162
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,960
 your cup of tea, I think.

163
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,120
 (audience laughing)

164
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,560
 That's gonna break the china.

165
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:13,160
 - Well, so this is the cool thing.

166
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:15,960
 If you drop a marshmallow onto a neutron star,

167
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:17,760
 if you're ever in a position to do so.

168
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:19,440
 (audience laughing)

169
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,240
 It's got such a strong gravitational pull

170
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:23,800
 that the impact will be the same as an atomic bomb,

171
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,080
 because of the amount of gravity

172
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,600
 pulling the marshmallows towards it.

173
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:29,720
 Do you guys know when the first supernova was recorded

174
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:30,720
 on Earth?

175
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:31,880
 - No.

176
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:35,600
 - The year 3,600 BC.

177
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,440
 - Hmm.

178
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:39,720
 - Yeah, it's this, so this is a paper that's been put forward.

179
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:42,640
 It was found in Kashmir on a cave wall.

180
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:45,760
 It was a cave painting, which had two bright glowing objects

181
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:46,760
 in the sky.

182
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:49,160
 And so this paper is putting forward the idea

183
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,960
 that it was the first recording of it,

184
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:53,800
 because the people in context of the painting

185
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,160
 weren't hunter-gatherers.

186
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,640
 They were in a very separate situation.

187
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:58,200
 So they looked at it very cleverly

188
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:00,000
 by going, "How can we prove

189
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,120
 that our theory is right?"

190
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,160
 It's a supernova.

191
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,320
 And there's something amazing about supernovas

192
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:05,760
 that have been logged.

193
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:08,560
 They, you know, it can happen back in 3,600

194
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,800
 and it was glowing in the sky.

195
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,640
 But the remnants of it still exist.

196
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,680
 You can still look for bits of it in the sky.

197
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:17,240
 So they've actually been able to look at one specific supernova

198
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:19,280
 and date it to roughly that period.

199
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,840
 So it's called HB9.

200
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,520
 That's the supernova that they believe it is.

201
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:25,040
 And they think 3,600 years ago in Kashmir

202
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,200
 first ever supernova recording.

203
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,960
 - And they named it after a pencil.

204
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:28,800
 - Yeah.

205
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:29,800
 (audience laughing)

206
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,560
 That's actually my auntie's name in Australia.

207
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,280
 (audience laughing)

208
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:36,600
 - There was a supernova in 1054,

209
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,200
 which was visible all over Europe.

210
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:40,320
 Europe was the best place to see it.

211
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:43,240
 It was visible in the daytime for three weeks.

212
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:45,320
 And at night time it was so bright

213
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:48,880
 that it cast shadows on people on earth.

214
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:50,520
 Okay, it was absolutely massive.

215
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:53,280
 But no one in Europe wrote about it.

216
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,120
 - Why not?

217
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,360
 - So it's written about in China.

218
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,360
 It was written about you can see it in cave paintings

219
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,080
 and stuff like that in other parts of the world.

220
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:00,960
 Basically there was a schism going on between

221
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:03,400
 the Roman Catholic church and the Orthodox church

222
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,240
 at the time.

223
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,400
 And apparently both sides thought that it would be

224
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,800
 an ill omen.

225
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:10,200
 And so no one wrote about it at all.

226
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,440
 And they just kind of ignored it.

227
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:12,280
 And it's like, what's that?

228
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:13,120
 I want nothing.

229
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:16,000
 (audience laughing)

230
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,160
 That's amazing.

231
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:19,800
 - You do get rogue black holes.

232
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,240
 These rebellious black holes

233
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:23,160
 that do wander around the universe.

234
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:25,720
 So a lot of black holes are at the center of galaxies

235
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:27,400
 and the vast majority that we've detected

236
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,000
 are at the center of galaxies.

237
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,840
 But you get some that don't have their own galaxy

238
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,880
 and they've only been detected recently.

239
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:36,040
 But it's kind of thought that they've basically

240
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:38,800
 had their galaxy stolen off them.

241
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:39,640
 So this is weird.

242
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:42,400
 This is what astronomers call mergers.

243
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:44,320
 It's like a financial terminology.

244
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:47,720
 But a minor merger is when a larger black hole

245
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:49,720
 eats up all the stuff that's circling around

246
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:51,520
 a smaller black hole.

247
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:53,120
 And then those poor black holes

248
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,840
 that have had their equipment stolen,

249
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,360
 they just spiral off into space

250
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:58,160
 and they're just bouncing around space.

251
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,880
 Oh, it's thought maybe they bump into another black hole

252
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,360
 to put it extremely crudely

253
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:04,680
 in a way that an astronomer would faint at.

254
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:07,720
 And yeah, they crash into another black hole

255
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:09,120
 and they propelled away into space.

256
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,960
 So there are lone black holes just

257
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,160
 be looking for a mate.

258
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,960
 But I think it's very cowboy-maveric black holes

259
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,440
 who don't give a damn with any of the things

260
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:19,360
 that are on the mission of vengeance to get that stuff back.

261
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:22,400
 Yeah, there's sexy black holes.

262
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,880
 Hey, why really like about this fact

263
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:28,440
 is the massive hole-- sorry, the massive fail bit?

264
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,360
 So what I love is the massive fail thing.

265
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:33,200
 Because astronomers have a really good sense of humor.

266
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:36,560
 There's a lot of jokes and a lot of just little acronym

267
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:37,920
 puns that happen.

268
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,160
 I found a couple.

269
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:41,720
 There's one that's called the collaboration between Australian

270
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:45,000
 and Nippon for Gamma Ray Observatory in the Outback

271
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,840
 or Candaro.

272
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:48,320
 Very nice.

273
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,360
 There's the package for the interactive analysis

274
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:54,600
 of line-amission or point of veil.

275
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,160
 One word.

276
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:56,680
 OK.

277
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:57,280
 One to veil.

278
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,120
 OK.

279
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:59,160
 [LAUGHTER]

280
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:01,120
 That's the top of the cloud.

281
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,120
 There's another one.

282
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:06,800
 There's a star that's been named after Vladimir Putin.

283
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,720
 Unfortunately, it's been named by Ukrainian astronomers

284
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:14,400
 who've named it Putin Hulio, or Hulow, which roughly translates

285
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,760
 as Putin is a dickhead.

286
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:18,520
 [LAUGHTER]

287
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:19,920
 And that's a star in the sky.

288
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,440
 It only costs $10 to do it.

289
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,680
 But it's quite nice that it's Ukrainian astronomers

290
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:24,920
 who officially did it.

291
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:25,400
 They do.

292
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:28,200
 They're famously in the astronomy circles.

293
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,360
 Good with acronyms.

294
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,360
 It's kind of like doctors.

295
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:34,160
 So you go to big astronomy conferences.

296
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,160
 And there's just all these presentations

297
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,160
 that are based on acronyms.

298
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:39,400
 So, yeah, I think there's poopsy, which

299
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:42,360
 is phase one observing proposal system.

300
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:48,560
 There's super-huge inter-ferometric telescope, which is--

301
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:49,360
 SHIT.

302
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,160
 SHIT.

303
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,440
 It's shit, Glasgow.

304
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:56,360
 I mean, probably if you're not more comfortable saying that.

305
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:58,160
 Normally, when audiences are all shouting shit,

306
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,360
 they're telling it to me.

307
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,960
 [LAUGHTER]

308
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:04,960
 There's this one that is absolutely pushing it too far.

309
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,480
 So this is what it's called.

310
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:09,760
 And this was a name for a workshop, a big astronomy conference.

311
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:12,800
 And it was titled "Testing Astroparticle

312
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:18,000
 with the New Gev Observations, Positrons, and Electrons,

313
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,720
 Identifying the Sources."

314
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,200
 It's too long.

315
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:25,120
 I forgot what the first letter was, because I know.

316
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,120
 It's Tango in Paris.

317
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:27,960
 Oh.

318
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:28,800
 It's too long.

319
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,880
 I imagine if someone got that.

320
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:33,760
 You would have only had to have listened.

321
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:36,760
 [LAUGHTER]

322
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:37,760
 Oh, yeah.

323
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:40,680
 Imagine the brain, the cause of it.

324
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:44,200
 I've reached that conclusion.

325
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,760
 So speaking of "Imagine the Brain,"

326
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:48,880
 we should probably be talking black holes at the death

327
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:51,400
 this week of Jim Bowen.

328
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:52,400
 What is it?

329
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:55,000
 [LAUGHTER]

330
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,240
 No, Stephen Hawking, of course, very much into black holes.

331
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,080
 Hawking radiation is what he's famous for, which

332
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:03,640
 is the fact that black holes get smaller over time

333
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:04,920
 by very, very small amounts.

334
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:06,640
 And he discovered that.

335
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:08,320
 He had quite a good sense of humor, didn't he?

336
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:08,800
 Yeah.

337
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:09,320
 I think.

338
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:10,440
 Amazing guy, yeah.

339
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:12,640
 His Tango in Paris joke didn't get down so well.

340
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:13,640
 [LAUGHTER]

341
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:14,360
 There's all this stuff.

342
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:14,880
 I love those.

343
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,800
 The official biography of him that came out in 2012

344
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:21,120
 was by a lady called Kitty Ferguson, very good biography.

345
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,600
 And she wrote in it that there was a rumor

346
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:25,000
 that Hawking used to run over the toes of people

347
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,640
 who annoyed him.

348
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:28,440
 And he would do it sort of subtly

349
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:30,880
 as if he was just turning around or something like that.

350
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,360
 And while she was writing the book,

351
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:34,800
 because she had access to him and asked him the questions,

352
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:37,440
 she said, is this true, this rumor that you do this?

353
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,600
 And he said, it is a malicious rumor.

354
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,120
 I'll run over to anyone who repeats it.

355
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:44,440
 [LAUGHTER]

356
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:47,080
 He was a wild wheelchair driver, though.

357
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:50,080
 Like years ago, when he was able to do whatever he wanted

358
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,080
 with his wheelchair.

359
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:54,840
 And a colleague said that he used to show off a lot with his tricks.

360
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,160
 So he used to do a lot of spins.

361
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,320
 He used to drive his wheelchair incredibly fast.

362
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:01,280
 He actually once broke his hip crashing into a wall

363
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:04,400
 in a show off stunt that got out of hand.

364
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:05,800
 Yeah.

365
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:09,440
 So the time was trying to section of Stephen Hawking's stories,

366
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,680
 basically, and things he'd done.

367
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:12,680
 There was a time where he was appearing on News Night.

368
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:14,120
 And he was in the pre-phase.

369
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:16,320
 They were getting the studio ready for him

370
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,720
 and they were setting up all the lights.

371
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:20,920
 And one of the producers pulled out a lead for one of the lights

372
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:23,040
 and Hawking immediately slumped over in his turn.

373
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:25,920
 [LAUGHTER]

374
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:31,400
 The producer absolutely freaks out.

375
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:34,520
 [LAUGHTER]

376
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:37,280
 Thinking he had killed Stephen Hawking.

377
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:38,480
 Kept round off to get some up.

378
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:42,200
 Came back a few minutes later, found him giggling and falling.

379
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,200
 What a guy!

380
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:47,000
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

381
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,760
 OK, it is time for fact number two.

382
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,640
 And that is Chazinski.

383
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:55,120
 My fact this week is that Levi Jeans are set on fire

384
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:57,040
 before they're sold.

385
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:00,400
 And this is specifically by Jeans.

386
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:04,440
 One's with holes in them or like distressed bits on them,

387
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:08,440
 like rips or bits that look cool.

388
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:13,480
 And they've been on fire in the factory.

389
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:14,480
 That's how they do this.

390
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:17,440
 So there's been a lot of coverage lately

391
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:20,320
 about how Levi is changing the way it distresses its jeans

392
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,360
 because it's got new laser technology, which

393
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:24,960
 allows it to make its jeans look really worn.

394
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:27,680
 Just with lasers rather than by hand.

395
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:31,120
 And yeah, if you fire a laser at Jeans, obviously,

396
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,400
 it can set them on fire.

397
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:35,440
 And that's how you get the effect of the holes in jeans.

398
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,240
 And if you're going to believe by a factory,

399
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:40,240
 or many Jeans factories also use kind of laser technology,

400
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,800
 then it just smells of smoke all the time

401
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:44,240
 because you're sort of setting Jeans on fire all the time.

402
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:46,000
 But this is really good because the previous way

403
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,440
 they did it was really bad, basically, right?

404
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:49,840
 Yeah, people having to do it.

405
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:52,240
 Yeah, you basically had people getting a pair of jeans,

406
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:55,320
 putting them on mannequins, and just scrubbing them with sandpaper

407
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:57,920
 and with chemicals, and they get very sick.

408
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:03,000
 I certainly would say put them on and set themselves on fire.

409
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,680
 In 2014, there was a Japanese brand which,

410
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:08,600
 to get their jeans distressed, they were called Zoo Jeans.

411
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:11,480
 And they had jeans which lions, tigers, and bears

412
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:13,680
 had attacked in a zoo.

413
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:16,600
 They only made three pairs, but I don't really

414
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:17,960
 think you want to wear those, do you?

415
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:23,760
 Because once a bear has gotten the taste for those jeans.

416
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:26,960
 It's true, it'll go in a mission of gene vengeance for you.

417
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,520
 Well, it was so clear how they did it.

418
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:31,400
 So they took old tires and giant rubber rings

419
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:34,280
 and things that animals and zoos are given to play with.

420
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:35,880
 They wrapped them in a sheet of denim,

421
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:37,880
 gave them to the animals, animals went rip, rip, rip.

422
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:40,800
 And then they took, as they said, the most fashionable remnants.

423
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,560
 [LAUGHTER]

424
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:45,960
 And they turned those into a pair of jeans.

425
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:47,280
 Very cool.

426
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:50,840
 Well, they also have got people to wear down jeans

427
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:52,680
 for potential consumers.

428
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:55,320
 So this is a Welsh denim label good here.

429
00:15:55,320 --> 00:16:00,160
 And they, in 2014, they hired 50 men to break in their jeans.

430
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,920
 So they made, they hired all these men,

431
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:06,000
 and they had to wear these jeans for six months non-stop.

432
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,120
 So wear them every single day, whatever they did.

433
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:09,720
 And they weren't allowed to wash them.

434
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:12,080
 And so there was, I read an interview with one of the guys.

435
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:14,400
 He said he wore them every day for everything.

436
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:16,240
 He played rugby in them.

437
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,080
 And he cut to them.

438
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,440
 So, you know, cooking spills.

439
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:19,720
 He did carpentry in them.

440
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:20,720
 He was a carpenter.

441
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:21,320
 He sunbathe.

442
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:22,560
 He cycled every day.

443
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,560
 He sun-baved in them.

444
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:25,600
 He did.

445
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:28,240
 He did not get a good tan.

446
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,400
 But then that's to kind of make them seem worn.

447
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:32,080
 And then they were auctioned off.

448
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:35,080
 And, you know, they got a few hundred pounds each for them.

449
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:38,640
 A few hundred pounds for six months' work, though.

450
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:39,160
 I don't know.

451
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:41,480
 It's not a good rate, is it?

452
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:45,280
 I hope the carpentry business worked out.

453
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:49,120
 Apparently, if you wear jeans and you commit a crime,

454
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,680
 they're kind of like a fingerprint.

455
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:53,040
 The police can tell the jeans they wear.

456
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:56,560
 And if they catch you on CCTV and the CCTV is good enough,

457
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:58,880
 they have a unique wear pattern.

458
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,880
 So, if you're caught on film, they can look at them.

459
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:03,040
 And they can tell that these are the actual jeans

460
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,280
 that were used in the robbery.

461
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:06,360
 As in the specific pair.

462
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:08,480
 Or they can tell that that was all he's wearing skinny jeans.

463
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,800
 No, no, they can tell the actual pair.

464
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:13,280
 So, like, let's say you have been playing rugby

465
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,040
 and sunbathing in a pair of jeans,

466
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:16,760
 or you've just been walking down the street.

467
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:18,320
 They look slightly different.

468
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:20,920
 And there are forensic people who can tell the difference

469
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:22,200
 between what you've been doing

470
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:24,400
 and can tell your jeans from someone else's jeans.

471
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,240
 Wow.

472
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:27,720
 What you should do is just have a pair of crime jeans.

473
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:28,880
 Oh, yeah.

474
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:29,880
 And when they're forensic, guys,

475
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:31,800
 like I said, well, these jeans have only been used for crime.

476
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:32,560
 We could.

477
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:35,360
 And then you keep them in a drawer.

478
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:38,680
 When you're out crime.

479
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:42,680
 They can't be used as armour, jeans, in a way.

480
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:45,640
 Because there was a guy in Pennsylvania a couple of years ago

481
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:49,800
 whose strange wife attacked him with a box cutter

482
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:51,640
 to his genitals.

483
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:53,720
 But his jeans were so thick that they

484
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:55,200
 stopped him from getting injured.

485
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,200
 Wow.

486
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,240
 It's a little tip for you.

487
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,240
 A little tip?

488
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:02,720
 A little tip?

489
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:06,680
 That's all he lost in the fight.

490
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:08,000
 Wow.

491
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,680
 Did it rebound off the cloth or did it--

492
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:11,720
 Yes, so there was a rip in the jeans,

493
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:14,600
 but she couldn't get through the jean fabric

494
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:16,560
 because it was really thick in the crotch area.

495
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:17,440
 Wow.

496
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:18,200
 Handy.

497
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,040
 Very.

498
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:21,600
 There's sometimes the process of making jeans is quite intense.

499
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:27,280
 So there's sometimes bakes, which to get that worn look.

500
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:31,440
 They're repeatedly washed.

501
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,080
 So they used to be sand blasted.

502
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:35,120
 But the new way of doing it with lasers

503
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:37,800
 is it takes 90 seconds, I think, to make a pair of jeans

504
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:39,320
 look like it's been worn for a year.

505
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:41,960
 Or is it used to take about half an hour?

506
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:44,600
 But do you know why-- so this is all kind of technology

507
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:47,040
 that Levi is at the forefront of?

508
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:49,760
 But do you know what made them famous?

509
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:51,320
 Why do we think they--

510
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:53,240
 What made Levi's famous?

511
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:54,560
 Yeah.

512
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:55,560
 Early jeans.

513
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:57,160
 Yeah, I thought they were like the first--

514
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,680
 Levi Strauss made the first jeans.

515
00:18:58,680 --> 00:18:59,680
 Yeah.

516
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,400
 So it didn't invent jeans.

517
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:06,000
 What he invented was, you know, the weird bits of metal--

518
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:06,800
 The rivets?

519
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:10,600
 The rivets in your jeans and that no one knows why the hell

520
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:11,320
 they're there.

521
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:13,000
 That's what Levi invented.

522
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
 So--

523
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,400
 That's what they're there to protect the genitals

524
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:18,080
 from your estranged wife, which you can tell you.

525
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:19,600
 Bizarrely, they didn't, because they

526
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:22,280
 had to get rid of them specifically on the crotch.

527
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:24,560
 Because if people were outdoors back in today,

528
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:26,560
 leaning over a fire, they would suddenly

529
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:28,400
 heap their genitals up.

530
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,040
 That was the biggest complaint.

531
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:32,200
 It was like, I was having a nice time by the fire

532
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:36,040
 when my balls lit on fire.

533
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:38,040
 But yeah, those metal bits actually keep them together.

534
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:39,520
 And I've always wondered what they're for.

535
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:42,160
 And they were invented in 1871 by a guy who

536
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,960
 came to Levi Strauss who marketed them.

537
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:45,080
 And they keep jeans together.

538
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:47,080
 So jeans used to just fall apart before that,

539
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:49,960
 because they didn't have that strengthening technology.

540
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:51,120
 And that's what they did.

541
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:53,560
 And they also put the tiny pointless pocket in,

542
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:55,640
 which, you know, that pocket that's inside the pocket.

543
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:56,760
 We know what that's for?

544
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:57,280
 Yeah.

545
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,000
 Yeah, it's for pocket watches, which

546
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,520
 haven't existed for about a century.

547
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:03,200
 And yet, still they are in jeans.

548
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:03,680
 OK.

549
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:04,200
 Yeah.

550
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:04,880
 That's good.

551
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,720
 And really, I think the patent for it,

552
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,680
 everyone assumes it's the denim, but it's actually

553
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:11,320
 the rivets when they actually filed the patent.

554
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:13,520
 That was the big thing that they were trademarking.

555
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:14,000
 That's cool.

556
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,200
 Yeah.

557
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,720
 This sort of stuff on lasers.

558
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:17,240
 Oh, yeah.

559
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:19,880
 And you know, the parrots have been flying through lasers

560
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:22,160
 recently, because this is--

561
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:24,760
 So scientists want to make better drones.

562
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:26,680
 They want to make us work out technology

563
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:28,360
 for how to fly better.

564
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:31,240
 And so they've been investigating how birds fly.

565
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:33,960
 And there was a study done, I think, last year.

566
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:36,640
 But there was a study done that looked at the flight of a parrot.

567
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,360
 But they needed to investigate exactly

568
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:40,320
 how they flap their wings when they take off.

569
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:43,520
 And so what they did was it was actually a parrot-let, which

570
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:44,080
 I really like.

571
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:45,680
 It's like a really tiny parrot.

572
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:48,000
 But what they did is they had it fly

573
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,960
 through a bunch of aerosol particles in the air that

574
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:53,920
 were then lit up with lasers, because they're so precise.

575
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:56,640
 So then you can have the aerosol particles all illuminated.

576
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:59,080
 And then the lasers kind of show what kind of wing

577
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:00,280
 movements they're making.

578
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:03,000
 And so they found out how birds' wings moves when they fly.

579
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,800
 And then we can use that in drone technology.

580
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:07,400
 But what's quite sweet is that obviously going through lasers

581
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,800
 is quite damaging for you.

582
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:12,480
 So if you look it up, they designed tiny pairs of goggles

583
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:15,920
 for the parrots to protect them from the lasers.

584
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:18,080
 Parrotlets as well.

585
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:19,080
 Parrotlets.

586
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:20,720
 Yeah, so they're tiny little glasses.

587
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:21,880
 Really tiny, yeah.

588
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:24,160
 It's almost as sweet as not making a parrot fly

589
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:25,280
 through a load of lasers.

590
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:28,280
 [LAUGHTER]

591
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:30,360
 I imagine Parrotlets would block children

592
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:34,480
 with parrots with Hava La Sholda.

593
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:35,040
 In person.

594
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:38,080
 In person four.

595
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:40,720
 OK, it is time for fact number three.

596
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:43,240
 And that is my fact this week.

597
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:46,920
 Thomas Edison tested over 1,600 different materials

598
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:49,600
 to find the right filament for the inside of his light bulbs,

599
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:52,400
 including fishing lines, cardboard,

600
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:57,080
 and hairs from the red beard of an old friend.

601
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:59,440
 Imagine if that had been the most successful as well.

602
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:00,280
 Yeah.

603
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:02,480
 All light bulbs would have to be full of red beard here by now.

604
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:03,800
 It did turn on.

605
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:06,200
 It would be excellent for the economy of Scotland.

606
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,200
 It would be good.

607
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:10,400
 [LAUGHTER]

608
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,680
 A risky comment.

609
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:14,160
 [LAUGHTER]

610
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:18,160
 Yeah, so this is one of those stories that

611
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:20,360
 is Thomas Edison as a character.

612
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:25,440
 So clouded in apocryphal stories and legends and so on.

613
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:28,040
 But this was reported in a number of official biographies

614
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:28,720
 by him.

615
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,920
 But the story goes that they were trying

616
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:32,960
 to work out how to make the light bulbs

617
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,800
 of the original light bulb he was doing

618
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:37,120
 last longer than a few hours or so on.

619
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,400
 That was-- they had a limit on it.

620
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:41,960
 And he tried over supposedly 1,600 things.

621
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:44,000
 And when it was 1,600 things, it would be like--

622
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,760
 they used like 40 different varieties of bamboo.

623
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:48,960
 So that would be part of the list, for example.

624
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,720
 There wasn't completely random things,

625
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:53,120
 like ripping beards off and so on.

626
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:56,280
 But one of the stories from an official biography

627
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:58,480
 says that a friend of his of old days, who

628
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:01,080
 was his boss at a station, at a railroad station,

629
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:02,440
 that he worked at when he was younger,

630
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:04,480
 called Mr. McKenzie, came in.

631
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:05,760
 He was a really fun character.

632
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:07,840
 And Edison, as a joke, said, why don't we

633
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:09,000
 try it with your red beard?

634
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,640
 Took off the strands, put it in.

635
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:11,480
 It did go up.

636
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:13,760
 And it had a red light, as it went up as well, which

637
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,880
 was nice, yeah.

638
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:17,320
 And yeah, so--

639
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:18,520
 Actually, when they did that, there

640
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:20,360
 was a competition between McKenzie

641
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:22,600
 and another guy called John Creucey.

642
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:24,480
 And they wanted to have a competition whose beard

643
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:26,280
 would be best inside the--

644
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:26,880
 Oh, really?

645
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:27,560
 Yeah.

646
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:32,000
 And Creucey, he was Swiss, and he had a big black bushy beard.

647
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,880
 McKenzie was more bristly and straight,

648
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:35,200
 and they had a competition.

649
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,200
 And McKenzie was the winner.

650
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:41,240
 But actually, they were both pretty shit.

651
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:43,520
 What was the thing that won, excuse my ignorance,

652
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:45,760
 and out of these 1600 things, was it the--

653
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:48,080
 Well, now we use what tungsten or something, don't we?

654
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:48,680
 Oh, yeah.

655
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:50,160
 But it was bamboo at the time.

656
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:53,160
 Wasn't it-- oh, sort of a bamboo film, I think, was what he is.

657
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:55,280
 So it was bamboo to start off with.

658
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:59,000
 He found Japanese bamboo, and he sent a team of explorers

659
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,200
 to South America, and they found some really good bamboo.

660
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:04,600
 But then they got confused, and they forgot where they found it.

661
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:06,560
 So they brought some back, but they couldn't remember

662
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:08,160
 where they got it from.

663
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:11,760
 So then he had to send another guy called James Recalton

664
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,800
 out to the jungles around the world, actually.

665
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:16,200
 Sri Lanka, Burma, Malaysia, India, all over.

666
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:20,280
 For a year, he looked around for the best perfect bamboo.

667
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:22,320
 And he got to Sri Lanka, and he found this bamboo.

668
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:25,440
 It was amazing, and it was going to be perfect for the light bulb.

669
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:28,080
 And he got home to Edison, and he said, I've got this bamboo.

670
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:30,320
 And Edison said, oh, we're using carbon now.

671
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:31,320
 Oh.

672
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:32,320
 Oh.

673
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:34,840
 And then carbon was the final thing that he used.

674
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:36,800
 That's really harsh.

675
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:38,120
 Yeah, it's quite funny though.

676
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:40,520
 You could at least have said, oh, thank you.

677
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:41,440
 This looks great.

678
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:41,960
 Thank you.

679
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:42,560
 Great.

680
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:46,640
 And then, quietly, he said, we're going to use the carbon.

681
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:48,960
 I'd like to have a few days of thinking he'd won.

682
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:50,640
 The amazing thing about the carbon, actually,

683
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:54,360
 that was invented by a guy called Lewis Howard Latimer.

684
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:57,080
 And he was an African-American drassman

685
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:58,920
 who was a son of an escaped slave.

686
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:01,000
 But the amazing thing about him is he

687
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,080
 invented the carbon filament, which made Edison's millions.

688
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:07,320
 But he was also the drassman who drew up the patent

689
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:09,960
 for Alexander Graham Bell's telephone.

690
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:10,480
 Wow.

691
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,840
 So he's made those two massive things.

692
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:15,440
 The big rivalry.

693
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:18,880
 But his light bulb was obviously very revolutionary,

694
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:21,520
 even though he didn't technically invent the light bulb.

695
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:25,200
 But I guess he was extremely good at PR, Edison.

696
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,760
 So he had this invention factory, which

697
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:30,280
 made sure they turned out the best inventions.

698
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:35,960
 And one good PR move he made was in 1884 on Halloween.

699
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:39,720
 So employees of the Edison Electric Lighting Company,

700
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:41,480
 they paraded up and down New York

701
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:43,520
 with light bulbs strapped to their heads.

702
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:44,360
 So they all had to--

703
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:46,440
 Everyone thought they were having an amazing idea.

704
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:48,880
 [LAUGHTER]

705
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:51,160
 Maybe that's where that came from.

706
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:52,160
 But yeah, this is amazing.

707
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:53,720
 It was a show off the new light bulbs, which

708
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:54,800
 had just been invented.

709
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:57,480
 And there was a huge horse-drawn generator

710
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:58,920
 in the middle of all these hundreds

711
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:01,760
 of employees of the factory, horse-drawn generator,

712
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:04,440
 which changed steam into electricity.

713
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:06,080
 So there's this big kind of steam powered machine

714
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:06,760
 in the middle.

715
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:09,040
 And then hundreds of people who were held together

716
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:11,400
 with wire that was going from the light bulbs

717
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:13,400
 on their heads and down through their sleeves

718
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:15,240
 and then linking them to the next person.

719
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:18,160
 So kind of like, there's gloves that you wore as a child

720
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:20,600
 that connected to each other through your chest.

721
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:22,600
 Oh, yeah, what?

722
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:23,680
 Yeah, missions.

723
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:25,080
 No, I mean around your chest.

724
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:28,600
 [LAUGHTER]

725
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:30,480
 But yeah, they paraded through New York.

726
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,160
 And it was this huge PR thing in the face.

727
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:34,680
 All these people tied together with light bulbs

728
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:35,720
 flashing on their heads.

729
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:38,200
 So sorry, were they tied together because it was one chain?

730
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:38,720
 Yes.

731
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:39,680
 It was one circuit.

732
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:41,960
 Imagine if one of them had gone like in Christmas lights,

733
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:45,440
 and you'd go to testing every individual employee.

734
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:46,440
 No.

735
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:49,480
 [LAUGHTER]

736
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:52,680
 He used to do-- so for ideas, he used to do this thing.

737
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:55,120
 And this again, it's been written in a bunch of biographies.

738
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:56,680
 And a lot of people think that this really happened.

739
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:58,080
 We're not sure.

740
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:59,720
 He used to, when he was falling asleep,

741
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:01,920
 he thought that's when he had his best ideas.

742
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,760
 And he would think, I would have the idea.

743
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:06,000
 And then I'd fall asleep, and I'd wake up later and go,

744
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,680
 oh, what was that amazing idea?

745
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:10,920
 So he used to take naps during the day on a chair.

746
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:13,160
 And in his hand, he would hold metallic balls,

747
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:16,160
 just two metal balls, with a metal plate underneath him.

748
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:18,880
 So as he was going into that zone where he was having an idea

749
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:21,680
 as he was going into a nap, his hand would go loose

750
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:22,960
 when he fell into the sleep.

751
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:25,440
 The ball would land in the plate, wake him up,

752
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:28,000
 and he could immediately go, ah, that idea is amazing,

753
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,880
 and write it down, and have it.

754
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:32,640
 And no one's officially said that that's definitely

755
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:34,280
 the case of how he did that.

756
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:36,960
 But there's a famous statue in Florida of him,

757
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,320
 which people always go and visit.

758
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:41,160
 And in his hand is a metal ball, which

759
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:44,440
 gives a little nod to the fact that they think it was true.

760
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:45,440
 That's cool.

761
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:47,040
 Yeah, he was famous for taking naps,

762
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:50,120
 because he said that sleep was rubbish,

763
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:51,200
 and no one needed that much.

764
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,960
 And he said he only had three hours sleep a night.

765
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:55,000
 But there were all these photos of him with Henry Ford,

766
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,880
 who was one of his best friends of Ford fame.

767
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:00,840
 There were all these photos of him sleep.

768
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:03,360
 Henry Ford's really often awake, and he's just having a nap

769
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:06,560
 in the background, just like constant catnaps.

770
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:08,120
 And they work close him and Henry Ford.

771
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:09,680
 They were super close, yeah.

772
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:12,240
 It's like proper BFFs for life.

773
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:13,600
 They went on camping trips together.

774
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:14,600
 Yeah.

775
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:17,680
 They went-- so Edison became confined to a wheelchair

776
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:21,000
 in his later life, and Ford bought a wheelchair for himself,

777
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,880
 so they could have wheelchair races.

778
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,160
 Yeah, no way.

779
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:25,880
 Yeah, that's pretty sweet.

780
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:28,200
 And there's a thing which is quite famous,

781
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:30,000
 but maybe a lot of people haven't heard, which

782
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,400
 was when he died, they captured.

783
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:34,520
 They were said to do this.

784
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:37,640
 And it was handed over to Henry Ford by Edison's son,

785
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:39,800
 the last breath of Thomas Edison.

786
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:41,560
 So they had these little test tubes.

787
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:43,840
 And there was eight of them that were sitting along there.

788
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:45,000
 Breathe this last breath.

789
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,040
 They put in the cork afterwards.

790
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:49,480
 And if you go to this day to the Henry Ford museum,

791
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:51,560
 he has the test tube on display.

792
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:55,600
 But yeah, you don't know which is going to be the last breath.

793
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,560
 They must've been said that for a long time.

794
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:58,520
 Yeah.

795
00:28:58,520 --> 00:28:59,640
 For months, maybe.

796
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:01,600
 You just wait that they wait for the test tube

797
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:03,240
 and say, here's the last--

798
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:05,640
 the second last breath of the day, all right.

799
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:06,960
 The third last breath.

800
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:08,360
 Final test tube.

801
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:09,680
 Yeah, I don't know.

802
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:11,320
 It's impossible.

803
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:12,480
 It's in a museum.

804
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:13,320
 Yeah.

805
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:15,000
 This won't go in, but I'll just quickly say it

806
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,320
 because I read it today.

807
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:18,520
 I read the last words of Rol Dahl.

808
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:21,840
 And Rol Dahl's last words, he was surrounded by his family.

809
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:22,720
 He was very ill.

810
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:26,120
 And his final words were, the thing I'm

811
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:28,440
 going to miss most is being with all of you.

812
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:29,320
 I was his final words.

813
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:31,320
 And then he went down, except it wasn't quite

814
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:33,120
 his last words, because the nurse who

815
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:35,320
 was with him thought, I'll make it easy on him

816
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:38,760
 and gave him a shot of morphine to make it go easy on the way out.

817
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:42,680
 But as she did it, he went, oh, fuck!

818
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:44,520
 And those were Rol Dahl's last words.

819
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:47,680
 It's brilliant.

820
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:50,040
 OK, it is time for our final fact of the show.

821
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:52,240
 And that is Andrew Hunter Murray.

822
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:55,040
 My fact is that it's only worth leaning over to pick up

823
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:59,680
 a 1P coin if you can do it in less than three seconds.

824
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:00,560
 Anything more than that?

825
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:01,400
 Waste of time.

826
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:02,560
 Move on.

827
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:04,040
 I reckon I could do it in that time.

828
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:05,200
 I'm sure you could.

829
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:07,360
 I'm sure you could.

830
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:09,800
 But you'd have to do it pretty much every three seconds

831
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:12,560
 for it to be worth me giving up my job.

832
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:13,240
 You would.

833
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:14,240
 Yes, yeah.

834
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:17,720
 This basically applies if you're on the median UK salary,

835
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:20,720
 which is £539 a week.

836
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:26,240
 And if you do that, assuming you work a 40-hour week,

837
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:29,320
 9 to 6 with an hour for lunch, let's say,

838
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:31,720
 you've got 2.6 seconds to do it.

839
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:32,240
 OK.

840
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:35,800
 Now, the problem is, if you are more than that, obviously,

841
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:38,320
 you have to do it a lot faster to make an economical exercise

842
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:39,080
 for you.

843
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:42,720
 So the Prime Minister, based on her current salary,

844
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:45,600
 I have assumed the 60-hour week for her, because she is busy.

845
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:52,160
 But I haven't given her an hour for lunch, don't worry.

846
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:55,960
 She would have to do it in 0.5 seconds, which is quite hard.

847
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:57,200
 That's tough.

848
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:00,160
 I've worked it out for Cristiano Ronaldo as well.

849
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:04,680
 On his current salary, he would have to do it in 0.0.2 seconds.

850
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:09,520
 And he would have to pick up 391 every second to make it work as well.

851
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:11,080
 He is quick, though.

852
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:12,040
 He is quick.

853
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:12,640
 Yeah.

854
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:16,920
 I worked it out for Philip Hammond, based on his independent

855
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:18,640
 article that estimated his income.

856
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:20,320
 So this is not just his salary.

857
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:22,360
 It's all of the money that comes in for him.

858
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:26,040
 And he would have to be able to pick it up in 0.2 seconds,

859
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:29,600
 which is, coincidentally, the limit of human reaction time.

860
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:34,960
 So he would have to immediately notice it, pick it up without any movement,

861
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:37,680
 just notice it, pick it up, notice it, pick it up.

862
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:40,600
 Basically, that's the fastest anyone can possibly pick up coins.

863
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:41,800
 I reckon, wow.

864
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:45,000
 But if he did that, he really would not be getting on with the job,

865
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,920
 but he-- and it is an important job he's got.

866
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:49,240
 I would say he should focus on being Chancellor,

867
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:52,280
 and then leave the coin picking to Theresa May.

868
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:54,960
 [LAUGHTER]

869
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:56,800
 Maybe that's what she's been doing.

870
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:59,920
 It's a strong plan for Brexit Britain, because it's

871
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:01,640
 looking for any coins we can find.

872
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:04,240
 [LAUGHTER]

873
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:06,000
 We've got no trade deals, but has anyone

874
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,240
 looked behind the sofa?

875
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:09,680
 [LAUGHTER]

876
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:16,440
 But this is partly about how the 1P is silly,

877
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:18,200
 but it's not worth very much at all.

878
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:21,040
 And there's a lot of talk of getting rid of it, right?

879
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:25,120
 So I think it's basically not worth picking it up at any point.

880
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:30,560
 You're not even allowed to pay with 1P's in more than 20 1P's.

881
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:32,040
 So I--

882
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:34,760
 So if something's 22P, you can't pay with just 1P's.

883
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:37,320
 Yeah, and I've broken the law on multiple occasions.

884
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:40,160
 Well, it's not a law, per se.

885
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:42,440
 It's that they don't have to accept it as legal tender.

886
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:43,200
 Yes.

887
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:45,880
 But if you're in one of those self-service places,

888
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:48,280
 and you can just put them in really quickly before they notice,

889
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:50,480
 then you can do as many as you want, actually.

890
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:53,440
 So yeah, there is an idea of getting rid of the 1P's and the 2P's.

891
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:55,320
 And I think Jar Jarzban wanted to do it.

892
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:56,400
 Didn't he when he was Chancellor?

893
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:58,320
 But David Cameron said we shouldn't,

894
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:01,360
 because everyone all voters out.

895
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:04,320
 And the amount of money you pay to make them

896
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:06,920
 is more than what they're worth.

897
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:10,720
 It's something like six out of 10 UK 1P and 2P's

898
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:13,600
 are only used once and then put in a jar.

899
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:17,880
 And then 1 in 12, the kinds of thrown into the bin immediately.

900
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:19,240
 And at one stage, the role meant

901
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:21,880
 was having to make 500 million 1P and 2P

902
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:25,320
 coins every year to replace those were going out of circulation.

903
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:28,720
 I do not believe anyone throws 1P coins into the bin.

904
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:31,920
 Does anyone here throw coins just into the bin?

905
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:33,920
 What it's 12 people do, so--

906
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:36,960
 No, in a charity box or into a jar.

907
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:38,360
 Straight in the bin.

908
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:40,520
 No, it's not maniac.

909
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:41,600
 But I've been tempted.

910
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:43,080
 It's completely insane, man.

911
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:45,160
 OK, so did you say 500 million a year?

912
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:45,640
 Yeah.

913
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:50,160
 Guess how many pennies the UK made in the year 1933?

914
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:51,160
 Cut.

915
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:54,720
 It's the worst game show ever.

916
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:55,760
 A billion.

917
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:57,600
 Seven.

918
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:59,560
 How are we so close?

919
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:02,240
 They made seven pennies for the whole year.

920
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:03,040
 What?

921
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:04,000
 Why did they do that?

922
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,200
 Because they had loads already hit us.

923
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:07,920
 So these are seven.

924
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:09,840
 But seven is a strange number, isn't it?

925
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:10,800
 You would think zero.

926
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:13,320
 Why would you need so more?

927
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:15,280
 Get the machines back up and running.

928
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:18,640
 Does anyone have seven P?

929
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:20,000
 OK, the reason for it was

930
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,800
 because I think the men didn't want to miss a year.

931
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:23,520
 They didn't want to have a year in which they did not make

932
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:25,080
 one of the coins at the realm.

933
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:26,120
 So they made seven--

934
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:26,960
 Oh, wait a minute.

935
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:28,120
 They must be really rare.

936
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:28,960
 That's so rare.

937
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:31,800
 So this is even rare, because three of them

938
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:33,880
 were placed by the king under the foundation

939
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:36,240
 stones of important buildings, OK?

940
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:39,240
 Two went to the British Museum, two went into private hands.

941
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:41,080
 What's buildings do we know what they are?

942
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:41,680
 I don't know.

943
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:44,040
 I think it probably is known.

944
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:46,680
 There are four prototypes coins as well.

945
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:51,800
 One of those in 2016 sold for 72,000 pounds.

946
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:52,320
 Wow.

947
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:54,760
 They're so rare that people start modifying

948
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:57,840
 a 1935 coins, because they can most easily be adapted

949
00:34:57,840 --> 00:35:00,680
 and made to look like a 33 penny.

950
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:04,600
 So if you do find one of those, do hang on to it.

951
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:07,960
 They used to, in the eighth century, they had pennies,

952
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:10,040
 but they didn't have-- because things would cost less

953
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:10,960
 than a penny.

954
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:12,640
 So what they ended up doing was just they

955
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:14,160
 would chop the pennies in half.

956
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:15,400
 So if you were at a shop, you'd be like,

957
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:16,160
 I need some change.

958
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:18,000
 And they would just slice your penny into

959
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,760
 and give you either the quarter of a half that they--

960
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:22,920
 We had pennies as well, didn't we, half pennies?

961
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:23,920
 Yeah.

962
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:25,320
 Sorry, pennies were--

963
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:27,000
 they came about from the chopping in half.

964
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,920
 And actually, the design of coins in that period,

965
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:31,320
 like the eighth century, around--

966
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:35,280
 and then in the 1200s Henry II introduced

967
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:37,040
 what was called the long cross coin.

968
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:39,200
 And it was a coin where the cross figured on it,

969
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:41,600
 the Christian cross, went probably from top to bottom

970
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:42,640
 and from right to left.

971
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:44,600
 And that was to make it easier to cut.

972
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:46,440
 And so that was if you could give change,

973
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:47,840
 you could give it more easily, because you could just

974
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:48,680
 break it up.

975
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:49,840
 And then that's where--

976
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:51,200
 Actually, that's where pieces of eight

977
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:52,160
 comes from as well, isn't it?

978
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:53,040
 Oh, really?

979
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:55,120
 Because you were saying before about piece of foreign,

980
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:57,160
 whatever, the piece of eight was you would have a coin

981
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:58,720
 and you would cut it into eight pieces.

982
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:01,560
 And that's why a quarter is called two bits in America.

983
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:03,040
 What have they made of?

984
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:05,080
 That you could chop it so easily.

985
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:06,080
 Metal.

986
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:08,200
 Soft metals, specifically silver.

987
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:09,880
 Silver and gold are quite soft, aren't they?

988
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:10,600
 Yeah, exactly.

989
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:11,600
 And this is--

990
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:14,560
 That's why if you get a gold medal and you bite it,

991
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:16,400
 to prove whether it's real gold on that,

992
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:18,520
 to prove it's gold, it's not harder, it's softer.

993
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:20,640
 So if you bite something that's made out of gold,

994
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:22,480
 you should get little teeth marks in it.

995
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:23,240
 Yeah.

996
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:24,240
 OK.

997
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:26,520
 Unless it leaves really big teeth marks, in which case,

998
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:27,600
 it's a chocolate coin.

999
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:28,120
 Yeah.

1000
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:31,120
 [LAUGHTER]

1001
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:32,280
 Don't be fooled again, Dan.

1002
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:35,520
 [LAUGHTER]

1003
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:37,000
 Just on that--

1004
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,600
 so people used to chop little bits off the edges of coins.

1005
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:40,920
 And that was a really bad crime.

1006
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:42,560
 And it had very severe punishments,

1007
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:44,680
 because obviously it's devaluing the coin on the realm.

1008
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:46,520
 But people used to do it anyway, because you

1009
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:48,760
 can melt down the silver and recast it.

1010
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:51,400
 And in 2015, again, a horde of silver clippings

1011
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:53,520
 was found in a field in Gloucestershire

1012
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:55,440
 by someone with a metal detector.

1013
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:59,080
 And it was a huge bundle of shaved off coins.

1014
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:00,760
 And I just love the name it's been given.

1015
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:02,960
 It was called the toenail horde.

1016
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:05,440
 Because it looks all these little round

1017
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:06,280
 trebings of coins.

1018
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:07,520
 They look like a tas of them.

1019
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:08,040
 That's amazing.

1020
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:10,760
 That's why coins have got milling on the side of it.

1021
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:13,480
 So little kind of indentations on the side of every coin,

1022
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:16,040
 if you look at it, that's to stop people from shaving off.

1023
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:18,880
 And that was invented by a think Isaac Newton, who

1024
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:21,240
 was the master of the mint, as well as doing all the other stuff

1025
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:22,240
 he did.

1026
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:23,800
 It's such a good name, isn't it?

1027
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:25,040
 Yeah.

1028
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:26,200
 Here's another idea.

1029
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:28,920
 Get rid of one piece, two piece, five piece, ten piece,

1030
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:30,080
 and 50 piece.

1031
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:35,240
 And instead have one piece, three piece, 11 piece, and 37 piece.

1032
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:37,120
 You've gone mad.

1033
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:37,760
 Yeah.

1034
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:39,080
 It's just maths, Andy.

1035
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:39,960
 It's just maths.

1036
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:42,640
 If you have those coins, then it makes it easier

1037
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:45,560
 for any kind of combination of coins

1038
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:48,960
 to be used for any number of any price, basically.

1039
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:49,960
 37 piece.

1040
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:52,840
 Yeah, because they're all prime numbers, so apart from one.

1041
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:55,400
 But they're all kind of prime numbers.

1042
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:56,920
 One's kind of a prime number, isn't it?

1043
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:59,880
 Oh, we're going to get somebody like that.

1044
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:03,960
 But basically, it means that say something's 76 p or 84 p,

1045
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:06,640
 it's just easier to work out with that specific number

1046
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:10,280
 of things. On average, it's 4.1 coins per transaction,

1047
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:12,520
 compared to 1p, 2p, and 5p and 7.

1048
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:14,240
 So there will be 37 p coins.

1049
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:15,800
 That's so hard to work out.

1050
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:17,760
 No, you get used to it pretty quick.

1051
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:20,040
 Now, if you had to learn your 37 times table,

1052
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:22,680
 just to pay for stuff.

1053
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:27,520
 You're the first person who introduced the penny to the UK.

1054
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:29,280
 So this is also in the 8th century.

1055
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:31,640
 And this is King Offer of Mercia.

1056
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:34,320
 So 8th century, he made the first penny in the UK.

1057
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:36,240
 And the incredible thing about this, which

1058
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:36,920
 I just love.

1059
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:38,720
 And I learn when I went to the British Museum.

1060
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:42,880
 And I saw an example of one of his early gold coins.

1061
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:43,480
 Is this?

1062
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:45,800
 So only three gold coins from his reign

1063
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:48,760
 survived, so the introduce of the penny to Britain.

1064
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:55,720
 And he was a Christian King and the phrase around this gold

1065
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:57,680
 coin in the British Museum is, there

1066
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:59,920
 is no God but Allah alone.

1067
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:00,840
 And it is because--

1068
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:01,640
 Oh.

1069
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:03,160
 It's so incredible.

1070
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:05,520
 So it was just a century after Muhammad, basically.

1071
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:09,880
 And the Abbasid Caliphs were taking over large parts of Europe.

1072
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:12,120
 And he wanted to be-- well, we're not entirely sure why

1073
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:12,800
 the coin said this.

1074
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:16,080
 But one theory is that he wanted to be able to trade with them.

1075
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:17,920
 And they would see these coins as valuable.

1076
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:20,000
 They would recognize that and think, yeah, you're one of us.

1077
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,200
 That's fine.

1078
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:22,880
 But then a lot of other people think, actually,

1079
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,240
 he just didn't speak Arabic.

1080
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:26,200
 And he had no idea what those words meant.

1081
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:27,320
 And he's a Christian King.

1082
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:28,640
 He accidentally wrote on his coins.

1083
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:29,960
 There's no God but Allah alone.

1084
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:33,760
 It's like a tattoo with some old kind of Japanese characters.

1085
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:38,240
 And it actually says, you English Winker.

1086
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:42,680
 Do you know what the least valuable coin in the world is?

1087
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:44,400
 It's an Uzbek coin.

1088
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:47,520
 And it's the one Tegan coin.

1089
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:50,960
 If you had 3,000 of them, you would have one penny.

1090
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:52,960
 That's an extreme way to use it as one penny.

1091
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:59,760
 And I worked out that Ronaldo, if he wanted to make a profit,

1092
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:03,720
 would have to pick up 1 million and 173,000

1093
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:07,080
 and Tegan every second.

1094
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:08,080
 He is fast, though.

1095
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:12,760
 OK, let's wrap up, guys.

1096
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:13,720
 OK, that is it.

1097
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:14,960
 That is all of our facts.

1098
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:16,360

 Yep, or you can go to our group account, which

1109
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:33,840

1110
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:36,800
 NoSuchThing is a fish.com where we have all of our links

1111
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:38,400

 We have links to our book.

1113
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:42,600
 We also have a link-- actually, we don't do.

1114
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:45,920
 It's a very exclusive thing that we've got this tour cassette.

1115
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:47,680
 And we're about to give one away, actually,

1116
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:50,720
 to a member of the audience who sent an effect to us

1117
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:51,960
 at the beginning of the show.

1118
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:54,840
 So for a cassette, Andy, what's the winning fact?

1119
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:57,920
 The winning fact comes from someone called Julien Mazet.

1120
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:00,280
 I hope I'm pronouncing the name right, and it's this.

1121
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:01,360
 It's about the city we're in.

1122
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:04,240
 It's that Glasgow was once voted the friendliest

1123
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:08,800
 and the most dangerous city in the UK in the same year.

1124
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:18,520
 OK, that's it.

1125
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:19,800
 That is all of our facts.

1126
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:21,640
 Thank you so much, guys.

1127
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:22,480
 We'll see you again.

1128
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:23,280
