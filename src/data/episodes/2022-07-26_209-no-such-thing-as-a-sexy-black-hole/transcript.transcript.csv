00:00:11,00:00:13,- Hello and welcome to another episode
00:00:13,00:00:15,"of ""No Such Thing as a Fish"","
00:00:15,00:00:18,a weekly podcast this week coming to you live
00:00:18,00:00:19,from Glasgow!
00:00:19,00:00:22,(cheering)
00:00:22,00:00:25,(audience cheering)
00:00:25,00:00:29,My name is Dan Schreiber
00:00:29,00:00:33,"and I am sitting here with Andrew Hunter-Marie,"
00:00:33,00:00:35,Annatuzinski and James Harkin.
00:00:35,00:00:38,"And once again, we have gathered around the microphones"
00:00:38,00:00:41,with our four favorite facts from the last seven days
00:00:41,00:00:42,and in no particular order.
00:00:42,00:00:45,"Here we go, starting with you, James."
00:00:45,00:00:47,"- Okay, my fact this week is,"
00:00:47,00:00:51,when a very large star quietly turns into a black hole
00:00:51,00:00:53,"without the usual explosion,"
00:00:53,00:00:57,the official term used by astronomers is a massive fail.
00:00:57,00:01:00,(audience laughing)
00:01:00,00:01:02,"- A star, as if it wasn't embarrassed enough."
00:01:02,00:01:04,It wasn't able to make the explosion.
00:01:04,00:01:07,"- Well, it turns out that about 30% of massive stars"
00:01:07,00:01:09,turn into massive fails.
00:01:09,00:01:11,And they found this out quite recently.
00:01:11,00:01:14,They were looking at an area of the universe
00:01:14,00:01:16,"called the Firework Galaxy,"
00:01:16,00:01:18,where there's loads of supernovas.
00:01:18,00:01:19,"So when it explodes, when you've got a big star"
00:01:19,00:01:21,"and it explodes, it's called a supernova."
00:01:21,00:01:23,"And eventually that turns into a black hole,"
00:01:23,00:01:26,but sometimes it's happening without the supernova.
00:01:26,00:01:27,And this area called the Firework Galaxy
00:01:27,00:01:29,had loads of supernovas.
00:01:29,00:01:32,"But the work quite as many as they thought there should be,"
00:01:32,00:01:33,and they couldn't work out why.
00:01:33,00:01:38,And then they were looking at a star called N6946-BH1.
00:01:38,00:01:43,"- My uncle's called that, so that's a nozzly name."
00:01:43,00:01:47,"- There's a prisoner number, isn't it?"
00:01:47,00:01:50,(audience laughing)
00:01:50,00:01:54,"When he's out in five years, you'll regret saying that."
00:01:54,00:01:57,(audience laughing)
00:01:57,00:01:59,"And they noticed that it wasn't there anymore in it,"
00:01:59,00:02:01,it just kind of quietly dissipated.
00:02:01,00:02:02,This is a thing that happens
00:02:02,00:02:05,that they've only just found out in the last six months or so.
00:02:05,00:02:08,- But I think massive fail is a really unfair way
00:02:08,00:02:12,"to characterize it, because so basically, yes,"
00:02:12,00:02:14,"the way stars turn into black holes is,"
00:02:14,00:02:18,"it was thought that they turn into a supernova, as you said,"
00:02:18,00:02:19,and so there's this huge explosion.
00:02:19,00:02:22,And then they suddenly shrink into a black hole.
00:02:22,00:02:24,"But then these stars aren't doing the explosion,"
00:02:24,00:02:28,but that actually means that they don't blow away
00:02:28,00:02:29,as much of the debris.
00:02:29,00:02:33,So apparently supernova blow off a lot of the stars outer layers.
00:02:33,00:02:37,"And so therefore, there's not as much gravitational pull"
00:02:37,00:02:39,left to make a massive black hole.
00:02:39,00:02:42,"So actually, the massive fails make a massive hole,"
00:02:42,00:02:45,a bigger hole than the massive successes
00:02:45,00:02:48,or whatever they call the supernova once.
00:02:48,00:02:51,- I didn't know the black holes are not really holes.
00:02:51,00:02:52,"- Yeah, what did you think they were?"
00:02:52,00:02:54,- I thought they were holes.
00:02:54,00:02:55,"- Oh, yeah, of course."
00:02:55,00:02:56,- I had the idea.
00:02:56,00:02:57,(all laughing)
00:02:57,00:02:59,- I could probably even firt that
00:02:59,00:03:00,from your previous sense of the stuff.
00:03:00,00:03:01,- I think I made it.
00:03:01,00:03:03,(all laughing)
00:03:03,00:03:06,"- But they're not, they're not, they're the opposite of holes."
00:03:06,00:03:08,"Do you guys know this, black holes are the opposite of holes?"
00:03:08,00:03:09,- What's the opposite of a hole?
00:03:09,00:03:10,- Like a sticky out thing.
00:03:10,00:03:11,- Just a big bulge.
00:03:11,00:03:13,"- Well, yeah, they're really, really full."
00:03:13,00:03:16,"They're fuller than anything you've ever seen in your life,"
00:03:16,00:03:18,because they're so dense.
00:03:18,00:03:21,"So for example, so how much do they weigh?"
00:03:21,00:03:24,"Okay, they could have a mass greater"
00:03:24,00:03:26,than 20 times the mass of our sun.
00:03:26,00:03:30,And the really big ones can have a mass equal to four million
00:03:30,00:03:33,"suns, as they're the extremely large supermassive black holes."
00:03:33,00:03:35,But they are everything crunched inwards.
00:03:35,00:03:36,- Yeah.
00:03:36,00:03:38,"- So it's just like a very large body,"
00:03:38,00:03:40,which has been crunched down to a tiny size.
00:03:40,00:03:41,- They could be any size really.
00:03:41,00:03:45,"Basically, it's the density that's the important thing."
00:03:45,00:03:47,"So you can have tiny ones, you can have massive ones."
00:03:47,00:03:47,You could be a black hole.
00:03:47,00:03:50,"If I squash you down to the size of about a tenth,"
00:03:50,00:03:52,"the size of a neutrino, you would be a black hole."
00:03:52,00:03:54,"- Okay, but you and me would fall out."
00:03:54,00:03:56,(audience laughing)
00:03:56,00:03:59,"- If the earth got about as dense as a black hole,"
00:03:59,00:04:01,if you were crunching it down to the roughly the density
00:04:01,00:04:05,"of a black hole, it would be about the size of an eyeball."
00:04:05,00:04:07,It would be about two centimeters across.
00:04:07,00:04:08,- Wow.
00:04:08,00:04:09,- That density.
00:04:09,00:04:11,"- And the whole point of it is,"
00:04:11,00:04:14,"the gravity is so strong, light can't get out of there."
00:04:14,00:04:16,You can't get to the escape velocity
00:04:16,00:04:18,because light can only go at a certain speed.
00:04:18,00:04:20,"And so nothing can escape,"
00:04:20,00:04:22,because light is the fastest thing that there is.
00:04:22,00:04:24,"And if light can't get out, then nothing can."
00:04:24,00:04:25,"- Although, that's the thing about black holes"
00:04:25,00:04:27,"has been challenged over the last few years, isn't it?"
00:04:27,00:04:31,"And by Stephen Hawking, who, yeah."
00:04:31,00:04:33,So it was assumed that black holes did have
00:04:33,00:04:34,this strong gravitational pull
00:04:34,00:04:37,that would mean that everything just disappeared into them.
00:04:37,00:04:41,But it turns out they do what is referred to as a cosmic burp.
00:04:41,00:04:46,"And this apparently is when they consume so much,"
00:04:46,00:04:49,"they overeat, they eat so much stuff"
00:04:49,00:04:52,that they're almost a force-fed huge amounts of gas
00:04:52,00:04:54,"and they can't swallow it all, so it's spits on back out."
00:04:54,00:04:55,- That's amazing.
00:04:55,00:04:57,"It's really hard researching black holes,"
00:04:57,00:05:00,'cause I guess we don't really know fully what they are.
00:05:00,00:05:01,It's all hypothetical.
00:05:01,00:05:02,"And as a result, they do stuff."
00:05:02,00:05:04,All the headlines I was looking into
00:05:04,00:05:07,"is colorful language, like they burp stuff up."
00:05:07,00:05:08,"Or I read one that I got excited by,"
00:05:08,00:05:12,which was a black hole caught having a post-lunch nap
00:05:12,00:05:15,after it eats solar system.
00:05:15,00:05:16,"And I was like, this is gonna be great."
00:05:16,00:05:17,And then it was not.
00:05:17,00:05:21,- What did you think it was going to be?
00:05:21,00:05:22,"When he said he was always gonna be great,"
00:05:22,00:05:24,did you think they were gonna describe the fold-out bed
00:05:24,00:05:27,that they had all set up in their office?
00:05:27,00:05:28,- I don't know.
00:05:28,00:05:30,I clicked on it just optimistically not thinking anything.
00:05:30,00:05:31,- Yeah.
00:05:31,00:05:33,- So the stage before a black hole
00:05:33,00:05:34,is a thing called a neutron star.
00:05:34,00:05:37,So this is where a star collapses
00:05:37,00:05:39,and it doesn't collapse with quite enough force
00:05:39,00:05:40,"to become a black hole,"
00:05:40,00:05:42,"but it does become a thing called a neutron star,"
00:05:42,00:05:43,"which is very, very, very dense,"
00:05:43,00:05:45,but not as dense as a black hole.
00:05:45,00:05:47,So this is very cool.
00:05:47,00:05:52,A sugar cube of neutron star would weigh on Earth a billion tons.
00:05:52,00:05:53,- Yeah.
00:05:53,00:05:54,- And?
00:05:54,00:05:56,"- It's hard to imagine what a billion tons is, isn't it, really?"
00:05:56,00:06:00,"- Yeah, it's like, imagine a billion one-ton elephants"
00:06:00,00:06:01,can I put it that way?
00:06:01,00:06:02,(audience laughing)
00:06:02,00:06:03,- Wow.
00:06:03,00:06:04,"- Yeah, exactly, right?"
00:06:04,00:06:05,- And.
00:06:05,00:06:07,"- So both of us, it's pretty difficult to pick up"
00:06:07,00:06:08,"your cup of tea, I think."
00:06:08,00:06:10,(audience laughing)
00:06:10,00:06:11,That's gonna break the china.
00:06:11,00:06:13,"- Well, so this is the cool thing."
00:06:13,00:06:15,"If you drop a marshmallow onto a neutron star,"
00:06:15,00:06:17,if you're ever in a position to do so.
00:06:17,00:06:19,(audience laughing)
00:06:19,00:06:21,It's got such a strong gravitational pull
00:06:21,00:06:23,"that the impact will be the same as an atomic bomb,"
00:06:23,00:06:25,because of the amount of gravity
00:06:25,00:06:26,pulling the marshmallows towards it.
00:06:26,00:06:29,Do you guys know when the first supernova was recorded
00:06:29,00:06:30,on Earth?
00:06:30,00:06:31,- No.
00:06:31,00:06:35,"- The year 3,600 BC."
00:06:35,00:06:36,- Hmm.
00:06:36,00:06:39,"- Yeah, it's this, so this is a paper that's been put forward."
00:06:39,00:06:42,It was found in Kashmir on a cave wall.
00:06:42,00:06:45,"It was a cave painting, which had two bright glowing objects"
00:06:45,00:06:46,in the sky.
00:06:46,00:06:49,And so this paper is putting forward the idea
00:06:49,00:06:50,"that it was the first recording of it,"
00:06:50,00:06:53,because the people in context of the painting
00:06:53,00:06:55,weren't hunter-gatherers.
00:06:55,00:06:56,They were in a very separate situation.
00:06:56,00:06:58,So they looked at it very cleverly
00:06:58,00:07:00,"by going, ""How can we prove"
00:07:00,00:07:01,"that our theory is right?"""
00:07:01,00:07:02,It's a supernova.
00:07:02,00:07:04,And there's something amazing about supernovas
00:07:04,00:07:05,that have been logged.
00:07:05,00:07:08,"They, you know, it can happen back in 3,600"
00:07:08,00:07:09,and it was glowing in the sky.
00:07:09,00:07:11,But the remnants of it still exist.
00:07:11,00:07:13,You can still look for bits of it in the sky.
00:07:13,00:07:17,So they've actually been able to look at one specific supernova
00:07:17,00:07:19,and date it to roughly that period.
00:07:19,00:07:20,So it's called HB9.
00:07:20,00:07:22,That's the supernova that they believe it is.
00:07:22,00:07:25,"And they think 3,600 years ago in Kashmir"
00:07:25,00:07:26,first ever supernova recording.
00:07:26,00:07:27,- And they named it after a pencil.
00:07:27,00:07:28,- Yeah.
00:07:28,00:07:29,(audience laughing)
00:07:29,00:07:31,That's actually my auntie's name in Australia.
00:07:31,00:07:33,(audience laughing)
00:07:33,00:07:36,"- There was a supernova in 1054,"
00:07:36,00:07:38,which was visible all over Europe.
00:07:38,00:07:40,Europe was the best place to see it.
00:07:40,00:07:43,It was visible in the daytime for three weeks.
00:07:43,00:07:45,And at night time it was so bright
00:07:45,00:07:48,that it cast shadows on people on earth.
00:07:48,00:07:50,"Okay, it was absolutely massive."
00:07:50,00:07:53,But no one in Europe wrote about it.
00:07:53,00:07:54,- Why not?
00:07:54,00:07:55,- So it's written about in China.
00:07:55,00:07:57,It was written about you can see it in cave paintings
00:07:57,00:07:59,and stuff like that in other parts of the world.
00:07:59,00:08:00,Basically there was a schism going on between
00:08:00,00:08:03,the Roman Catholic church and the Orthodox church
00:08:03,00:08:04,at the time.
00:08:04,00:08:06,And apparently both sides thought that it would be
00:08:06,00:08:07,an ill omen.
00:08:07,00:08:10,And so no one wrote about it at all.
00:08:10,00:08:11,And they just kind of ignored it.
00:08:11,00:08:12,"And it's like, what's that?"
00:08:12,00:08:13,I want nothing.
00:08:13,00:08:16,(audience laughing)
00:08:16,00:08:17,That's amazing.
00:08:17,00:08:19,- You do get rogue black holes.
00:08:19,00:08:21,These rebellious black holes
00:08:21,00:08:23,that do wander around the universe.
00:08:23,00:08:25,So a lot of black holes are at the center of galaxies
00:08:25,00:08:27,and the vast majority that we've detected
00:08:27,00:08:29,are at the center of galaxies.
00:08:29,00:08:31,But you get some that don't have their own galaxy
00:08:31,00:08:33,and they've only been detected recently.
00:08:33,00:08:36,But it's kind of thought that they've basically
00:08:36,00:08:38,had their galaxy stolen off them.
00:08:38,00:08:39,So this is weird.
00:08:39,00:08:42,This is what astronomers call mergers.
00:08:42,00:08:44,It's like a financial terminology.
00:08:44,00:08:47,But a minor merger is when a larger black hole
00:08:47,00:08:49,eats up all the stuff that's circling around
00:08:49,00:08:51,a smaller black hole.
00:08:51,00:08:53,And then those poor black holes
00:08:53,00:08:54,"that have had their equipment stolen,"
00:08:54,00:08:56,they just spiral off into space
00:08:56,00:08:58,and they're just bouncing around space.
00:08:58,00:09:00,"Oh, it's thought maybe they bump into another black hole"
00:09:00,00:09:02,to put it extremely crudely
00:09:02,00:09:04,in a way that an astronomer would faint at.
00:09:04,00:09:07,"And yeah, they crash into another black hole"
00:09:07,00:09:09,and they propelled away into space.
00:09:09,00:09:10,So there are lone black holes just
00:09:10,00:09:12,be looking for a mate.
00:09:12,00:09:14,But I think it's very cowboy-maveric black holes
00:09:14,00:09:16,who don't give a damn with any of the things
00:09:16,00:09:19,that are on the mission of vengeance to get that stuff back.
00:09:19,00:09:22,"Yeah, there's sexy black holes."
00:09:22,00:09:23,"Hey, why really like about this fact"
00:09:23,00:09:28,"is the massive hole-- sorry, the massive fail bit?"
00:09:28,00:09:30,So what I love is the massive fail thing.
00:09:30,00:09:33,Because astronomers have a really good sense of humor.
00:09:33,00:09:36,There's a lot of jokes and a lot of just little acronym
00:09:36,00:09:37,puns that happen.
00:09:37,00:09:39,I found a couple.
00:09:39,00:09:41,There's one that's called the collaboration between Australian
00:09:41,00:09:45,and Nippon for Gamma Ray Observatory in the Outback
00:09:45,00:09:46,or Candaro.
00:09:46,00:09:48,Very nice.
00:09:48,00:09:51,There's the package for the interactive analysis
00:09:51,00:09:54,of line-amission or point of veil.
00:09:54,00:09:56,One word.
00:09:56,00:09:56,OK.
00:09:56,00:09:57,One to veil.
00:09:57,00:09:58,OK.
00:09:58,00:09:59,[LAUGHTER]
00:09:59,00:10:01,That's the top of the cloud.
00:10:01,00:10:02,There's another one.
00:10:02,00:10:06,There's a star that's been named after Vladimir Putin.
00:10:06,00:10:09,"Unfortunately, it's been named by Ukrainian astronomers"
00:10:09,00:10:14,"who've named it Putin Hulio, or Hulow, which roughly translates"
00:10:14,00:10:15,as Putin is a dickhead.
00:10:15,00:10:18,[LAUGHTER]
00:10:18,00:10:19,And that's a star in the sky.
00:10:19,00:10:21,It only costs $10 to do it.
00:10:21,00:10:23,But it's quite nice that it's Ukrainian astronomers
00:10:23,00:10:24,who officially did it.
00:10:24,00:10:25,They do.
00:10:25,00:10:28,They're famously in the astronomy circles.
00:10:28,00:10:29,Good with acronyms.
00:10:29,00:10:30,It's kind of like doctors.
00:10:30,00:10:34,So you go to big astronomy conferences.
00:10:34,00:10:36,And there's just all these presentations
00:10:36,00:10:37,that are based on acronyms.
00:10:37,00:10:39,"So, yeah, I think there's poopsy, which"
00:10:39,00:10:42,is phase one observing proposal system.
00:10:42,00:10:48,"There's super-huge inter-ferometric telescope, which is--"
00:10:48,00:10:49,SHIT.
00:10:49,00:10:50,SHIT.
00:10:50,00:10:51,"It's shit, Glasgow."
00:10:51,00:10:56,"I mean, probably if you're not more comfortable saying that."
00:10:56,00:10:58,"Normally, when audiences are all shouting shit,"
00:10:58,00:10:59,they're telling it to me.
00:10:59,00:11:01,[LAUGHTER]
00:11:01,00:11:04,There's this one that is absolutely pushing it too far.
00:11:04,00:11:06,So this is what it's called.
00:11:06,00:11:09,"And this was a name for a workshop, a big astronomy conference."
00:11:09,00:11:12,"And it was titled ""Testing Astroparticle"
00:11:12,00:11:18,"with the New Gev Observations, Positrons, and Electrons,"
00:11:18,00:11:20,"Identifying the Sources."""
00:11:20,00:11:22,It's too long.
00:11:22,00:11:25,"I forgot what the first letter was, because I know."
00:11:25,00:11:27,It's Tango in Paris.
00:11:27,00:11:27,Oh.
00:11:27,00:11:28,It's too long.
00:11:28,00:11:31,I imagine if someone got that.
00:11:31,00:11:33,You would have only had to have listened.
00:11:33,00:11:36,[LAUGHTER]
00:11:36,00:11:37,"Oh, yeah."
00:11:37,00:11:40,"Imagine the brain, the cause of it."
00:11:40,00:11:44,I've reached that conclusion.
00:11:44,00:11:45,"So speaking of ""Imagine the Brain,"""
00:11:45,00:11:48,we should probably be talking black holes at the death
00:11:48,00:11:51,this week of Jim Bowen.
00:11:51,00:11:52,What is it?
00:11:52,00:11:55,[LAUGHTER]
00:11:55,00:11:58,"No, Stephen Hawking, of course, very much into black holes."
00:11:58,00:12:01,"Hawking radiation is what he's famous for, which"
00:12:01,00:12:03,is the fact that black holes get smaller over time
00:12:03,00:12:04,"by very, very small amounts."
00:12:04,00:12:06,And he discovered that.
00:12:06,00:12:08,"He had quite a good sense of humor, didn't he?"
00:12:08,00:12:08,Yeah.
00:12:08,00:12:09,I think.
00:12:09,00:12:10,"Amazing guy, yeah."
00:12:10,00:12:12,His Tango in Paris joke didn't get down so well.
00:12:12,00:12:13,[LAUGHTER]
00:12:13,00:12:14,There's all this stuff.
00:12:14,00:12:14,I love those.
00:12:14,00:12:17,The official biography of him that came out in 2012
00:12:17,00:12:21,"was by a lady called Kitty Ferguson, very good biography."
00:12:21,00:12:22,And she wrote in it that there was a rumor
00:12:22,00:12:25,that Hawking used to run over the toes of people
00:12:25,00:12:26,who annoyed him.
00:12:26,00:12:28,And he would do it sort of subtly
00:12:28,00:12:30,as if he was just turning around or something like that.
00:12:30,00:12:32,"And while she was writing the book,"
00:12:32,00:12:34,"because she had access to him and asked him the questions,"
00:12:34,00:12:37,"she said, is this true, this rumor that you do this?"
00:12:37,00:12:39,"And he said, it is a malicious rumor."
00:12:39,00:12:41,I'll run over to anyone who repeats it.
00:12:41,00:12:44,[LAUGHTER]
00:12:44,00:12:47,"He was a wild wheelchair driver, though."
00:12:47,00:12:50,"Like years ago, when he was able to do whatever he wanted"
00:12:50,00:12:51,with his wheelchair.
00:12:51,00:12:54,And a colleague said that he used to show off a lot with his tricks.
00:12:54,00:12:56,So he used to do a lot of spins.
00:12:56,00:12:58,He used to drive his wheelchair incredibly fast.
00:12:58,00:13:01,He actually once broke his hip crashing into a wall
00:13:01,00:13:04,in a show off stunt that got out of hand.
00:13:04,00:13:05,Yeah.
00:13:05,00:13:09,"So the time was trying to section of Stephen Hawking's stories,"
00:13:09,00:13:10,"basically, and things he'd done."
00:13:10,00:13:12,There was a time where he was appearing on News Night.
00:13:12,00:13:14,And he was in the pre-phase.
00:13:14,00:13:16,They were getting the studio ready for him
00:13:16,00:13:17,and they were setting up all the lights.
00:13:17,00:13:20,And one of the producers pulled out a lead for one of the lights
00:13:20,00:13:23,and Hawking immediately slumped over in his turn.
00:13:23,00:13:25,[LAUGHTER]
00:13:25,00:13:31,The producer absolutely freaks out.
00:13:31,00:13:34,[LAUGHTER]
00:13:34,00:13:37,Thinking he had killed Stephen Hawking.
00:13:37,00:13:38,Kept round off to get some up.
00:13:38,00:13:42,"Came back a few minutes later, found him giggling and falling."
00:13:42,00:13:43,What a guy!
00:13:43,00:13:47,[MUSIC PLAYING]
00:13:47,00:13:49,"OK, it is time for fact number two."
00:13:49,00:13:51,And that is Chazinski.
00:13:51,00:13:55,My fact this week is that Levi Jeans are set on fire
00:13:55,00:13:57,before they're sold.
00:13:57,00:14:00,And this is specifically by Jeans.
00:14:00,00:14:04,"One's with holes in them or like distressed bits on them,"
00:14:04,00:14:08,like rips or bits that look cool.
00:14:08,00:14:13,And they've been on fire in the factory.
00:14:13,00:14:14,That's how they do this.
00:14:14,00:14:17,So there's been a lot of coverage lately
00:14:17,00:14:20,about how Levi is changing the way it distresses its jeans
00:14:20,00:14:22,"because it's got new laser technology, which"
00:14:22,00:14:24,allows it to make its jeans look really worn.
00:14:24,00:14:27,Just with lasers rather than by hand.
00:14:27,00:14:31,"And yeah, if you fire a laser at Jeans, obviously,"
00:14:31,00:14:32,it can set them on fire.
00:14:32,00:14:35,And that's how you get the effect of the holes in jeans.
00:14:35,00:14:37,"And if you're going to believe by a factory,"
00:14:37,00:14:40,"or many Jeans factories also use kind of laser technology,"
00:14:40,00:14:41,then it just smells of smoke all the time
00:14:41,00:14:44,because you're sort of setting Jeans on fire all the time.
00:14:44,00:14:46,But this is really good because the previous way
00:14:46,00:14:48,"they did it was really bad, basically, right?"
00:14:48,00:14:49,"Yeah, people having to do it."
00:14:49,00:14:52,"Yeah, you basically had people getting a pair of jeans,"
00:14:52,00:14:55,"putting them on mannequins, and just scrubbing them with sandpaper"
00:14:55,00:14:57,"and with chemicals, and they get very sick."
00:14:57,00:15:03,I certainly would say put them on and set themselves on fire.
00:15:03,00:15:05,"In 2014, there was a Japanese brand which,"
00:15:05,00:15:08,"to get their jeans distressed, they were called Zoo Jeans."
00:15:08,00:15:11,"And they had jeans which lions, tigers, and bears"
00:15:11,00:15:13,had attacked in a zoo.
00:15:13,00:15:16,"They only made three pairs, but I don't really"
00:15:16,00:15:17,"think you want to wear those, do you?"
00:15:17,00:15:23,Because once a bear has gotten the taste for those jeans.
00:15:23,00:15:26,"It's true, it'll go in a mission of gene vengeance for you."
00:15:26,00:15:28,"Well, it was so clear how they did it."
00:15:28,00:15:31,So they took old tires and giant rubber rings
00:15:31,00:15:34,and things that animals and zoos are given to play with.
00:15:34,00:15:35,"They wrapped them in a sheet of denim,"
00:15:35,00:15:37,"gave them to the animals, animals went rip, rip, rip."
00:15:37,00:15:40,"And then they took, as they said, the most fashionable remnants."
00:15:40,00:15:43,[LAUGHTER]
00:15:43,00:15:45,And they turned those into a pair of jeans.
00:15:45,00:15:47,Very cool.
00:15:47,00:15:50,"Well, they also have got people to wear down jeans"
00:15:50,00:15:52,for potential consumers.
00:15:52,00:15:55,So this is a Welsh denim label good here.
00:15:55,00:16:00,"And they, in 2014, they hired 50 men to break in their jeans."
00:16:00,00:16:02,"So they made, they hired all these men,"
00:16:02,00:16:06,and they had to wear these jeans for six months non-stop.
00:16:06,00:16:08,"So wear them every single day, whatever they did."
00:16:08,00:16:09,And they weren't allowed to wash them.
00:16:09,00:16:12,"And so there was, I read an interview with one of the guys."
00:16:12,00:16:14,He said he wore them every day for everything.
00:16:14,00:16:16,He played rugby in them.
00:16:16,00:16:17,And he cut to them.
00:16:17,00:16:18,"So, you know, cooking spills."
00:16:18,00:16:19,He did carpentry in them.
00:16:19,00:16:20,He was a carpenter.
00:16:20,00:16:21,He sunbathe.
00:16:21,00:16:22,He cycled every day.
00:16:22,00:16:24,He sun-baved in them.
00:16:24,00:16:25,He did.
00:16:25,00:16:28,He did not get a good tan.
00:16:28,00:16:30,But then that's to kind of make them seem worn.
00:16:30,00:16:32,And then they were auctioned off.
00:16:32,00:16:35,"And, you know, they got a few hundred pounds each for them."
00:16:35,00:16:38,"A few hundred pounds for six months' work, though."
00:16:38,00:16:39,I don't know.
00:16:39,00:16:41,"It's not a good rate, is it?"
00:16:41,00:16:45,I hope the carpentry business worked out.
00:16:45,00:16:49,"Apparently, if you wear jeans and you commit a crime,"
00:16:49,00:16:50,they're kind of like a fingerprint.
00:16:50,00:16:53,The police can tell the jeans they wear.
00:16:53,00:16:56,"And if they catch you on CCTV and the CCTV is good enough,"
00:16:56,00:16:58,they have a unique wear pattern.
00:16:58,00:17:00,"So, if you're caught on film, they can look at them."
00:17:00,00:17:03,And they can tell that these are the actual jeans
00:17:03,00:17:04,that were used in the robbery.
00:17:04,00:17:06,As in the specific pair.
00:17:06,00:17:08,Or they can tell that that was all he's wearing skinny jeans.
00:17:08,00:17:10,"No, no, they can tell the actual pair."
00:17:10,00:17:13,"So, like, let's say you have been playing rugby"
00:17:13,00:17:15,"and sunbathing in a pair of jeans,"
00:17:15,00:17:16,or you've just been walking down the street.
00:17:16,00:17:18,They look slightly different.
00:17:18,00:17:20,And there are forensic people who can tell the difference
00:17:20,00:17:22,between what you've been doing
00:17:22,00:17:24,and can tell your jeans from someone else's jeans.
00:17:24,00:17:25,Wow.
00:17:25,00:17:27,What you should do is just have a pair of crime jeans.
00:17:27,00:17:28,"Oh, yeah."
00:17:28,00:17:29,"And when they're forensic, guys,"
00:17:29,00:17:31,"like I said, well, these jeans have only been used for crime."
00:17:31,00:17:32,We could.
00:17:32,00:17:35,And then you keep them in a drawer.
00:17:35,00:17:38,When you're out crime.
00:17:38,00:17:42,"They can't be used as armour, jeans, in a way."
00:17:42,00:17:45,Because there was a guy in Pennsylvania a couple of years ago
00:17:45,00:17:49,whose strange wife attacked him with a box cutter
00:17:49,00:17:51,to his genitals.
00:17:51,00:17:53,But his jeans were so thick that they
00:17:53,00:17:55,stopped him from getting injured.
00:17:55,00:17:56,Wow.
00:17:56,00:17:58,It's a little tip for you.
00:17:58,00:17:59,A little tip?
00:17:59,00:18:02,A little tip?
00:18:02,00:18:06,That's all he lost in the fight.
00:18:06,00:18:08,Wow.
00:18:08,00:18:09,Did it rebound off the cloth or did it--
00:18:09,00:18:11,"Yes, so there was a rip in the jeans,"
00:18:11,00:18:14,but she couldn't get through the jean fabric
00:18:14,00:18:16,because it was really thick in the crotch area.
00:18:16,00:18:17,Wow.
00:18:17,00:18:18,Handy.
00:18:18,00:18:19,Very.
00:18:19,00:18:21,There's sometimes the process of making jeans is quite intense.
00:18:21,00:18:27,"So there's sometimes bakes, which to get that worn look."
00:18:27,00:18:31,They're repeatedly washed.
00:18:31,00:18:33,So they used to be sand blasted.
00:18:33,00:18:35,But the new way of doing it with lasers
00:18:35,00:18:37,"is it takes 90 seconds, I think, to make a pair of jeans"
00:18:37,00:18:39,look like it's been worn for a year.
00:18:39,00:18:41,Or is it used to take about half an hour?
00:18:41,00:18:44,But do you know why-- so this is all kind of technology
00:18:44,00:18:47,that Levi is at the forefront of?
00:18:47,00:18:49,But do you know what made them famous?
00:18:49,00:18:51,Why do we think they--
00:18:51,00:18:53,What made Levi's famous?
00:18:53,00:18:54,Yeah.
00:18:54,00:18:55,Early jeans.
00:18:55,00:18:57,"Yeah, I thought they were like the first--"
00:18:57,00:18:58,Levi Strauss made the first jeans.
00:18:58,00:18:59,Yeah.
00:18:59,00:19:01,So it didn't invent jeans.
00:19:01,00:19:06,"What he invented was, you know, the weird bits of metal--"
00:19:06,00:19:06,The rivets?
00:19:06,00:19:10,The rivets in your jeans and that no one knows why the hell
00:19:10,00:19:11,they're there.
00:19:11,00:19:13,That's what Levi invented.
00:19:13,00:19:14,So--
00:19:14,00:19:15,That's what they're there to protect the genitals
00:19:15,00:19:18,"from your estranged wife, which you can tell you."
00:19:18,00:19:19,"Bizarrely, they didn't, because they"
00:19:19,00:19:22,had to get rid of them specifically on the crotch.
00:19:22,00:19:24,"Because if people were outdoors back in today,"
00:19:24,00:19:26,"leaning over a fire, they would suddenly"
00:19:26,00:19:28,heap their genitals up.
00:19:28,00:19:30,That was the biggest complaint.
00:19:30,00:19:32,"It was like, I was having a nice time by the fire"
00:19:32,00:19:36,when my balls lit on fire.
00:19:36,00:19:38,"But yeah, those metal bits actually keep them together."
00:19:38,00:19:39,And I've always wondered what they're for.
00:19:39,00:19:42,And they were invented in 1871 by a guy who
00:19:42,00:19:43,came to Levi Strauss who marketed them.
00:19:43,00:19:45,And they keep jeans together.
00:19:45,00:19:47,"So jeans used to just fall apart before that,"
00:19:47,00:19:49,because they didn't have that strengthening technology.
00:19:49,00:19:51,And that's what they did.
00:19:51,00:19:53,"And they also put the tiny pointless pocket in,"
00:19:53,00:19:55,"which, you know, that pocket that's inside the pocket."
00:19:55,00:19:56,We know what that's for?
00:19:56,00:19:57,Yeah.
00:19:57,00:19:59,"Yeah, it's for pocket watches, which"
00:19:59,00:20:01,haven't existed for about a century.
00:20:01,00:20:03,"And yet, still they are in jeans."
00:20:03,00:20:03,OK.
00:20:03,00:20:04,Yeah.
00:20:04,00:20:04,That's good.
00:20:04,00:20:06,"And really, I think the patent for it,"
00:20:06,00:20:08,"everyone assumes it's the denim, but it's actually"
00:20:08,00:20:11,the rivets when they actually filed the patent.
00:20:11,00:20:13,That was the big thing that they were trademarking.
00:20:13,00:20:14,That's cool.
00:20:14,00:20:15,Yeah.
00:20:15,00:20:16,This sort of stuff on lasers.
00:20:16,00:20:17,"Oh, yeah."
00:20:17,00:20:19,"And you know, the parrots have been flying through lasers"
00:20:19,00:20:22,"recently, because this is--"
00:20:22,00:20:24,So scientists want to make better drones.
00:20:24,00:20:26,They want to make us work out technology
00:20:26,00:20:28,for how to fly better.
00:20:28,00:20:31,And so they've been investigating how birds fly.
00:20:31,00:20:33,"And there was a study done, I think, last year."
00:20:33,00:20:36,But there was a study done that looked at the flight of a parrot.
00:20:36,00:20:38,But they needed to investigate exactly
00:20:38,00:20:40,how they flap their wings when they take off.
00:20:40,00:20:43,"And so what they did was it was actually a parrot-let, which"
00:20:43,00:20:44,I really like.
00:20:44,00:20:45,It's like a really tiny parrot.
00:20:45,00:20:48,But what they did is they had it fly
00:20:48,00:20:50,through a bunch of aerosol particles in the air that
00:20:50,00:20:53,"were then lit up with lasers, because they're so precise."
00:20:53,00:20:56,So then you can have the aerosol particles all illuminated.
00:20:56,00:20:59,And then the lasers kind of show what kind of wing
00:20:59,00:21:00,movements they're making.
00:21:00,00:21:03,And so they found out how birds' wings moves when they fly.
00:21:03,00:21:04,And then we can use that in drone technology.
00:21:04,00:21:07,But what's quite sweet is that obviously going through lasers
00:21:07,00:21:08,is quite damaging for you.
00:21:08,00:21:12,"So if you look it up, they designed tiny pairs of goggles"
00:21:12,00:21:15,for the parrots to protect them from the lasers.
00:21:15,00:21:18,Parrotlets as well.
00:21:18,00:21:19,Parrotlets.
00:21:19,00:21:20,"Yeah, so they're tiny little glasses."
00:21:20,00:21:21,"Really tiny, yeah."
00:21:21,00:21:24,It's almost as sweet as not making a parrot fly
00:21:24,00:21:25,through a load of lasers.
00:21:25,00:21:28,[LAUGHTER]
00:21:28,00:21:30,I imagine Parrotlets would block children
00:21:30,00:21:34,with parrots with Hava La Sholda.
00:21:34,00:21:35,In person.
00:21:35,00:21:38,In person four.
00:21:38,00:21:40,"OK, it is time for fact number three."
00:21:40,00:21:43,And that is my fact this week.
00:21:43,00:21:46,"Thomas Edison tested over 1,600 different materials"
00:21:46,00:21:49,"to find the right filament for the inside of his light bulbs,"
00:21:49,00:21:52,"including fishing lines, cardboard,"
00:21:52,00:21:57,and hairs from the red beard of an old friend.
00:21:57,00:21:59,Imagine if that had been the most successful as well.
00:21:59,00:22:00,Yeah.
00:22:00,00:22:02,All light bulbs would have to be full of red beard here by now.
00:22:02,00:22:03,It did turn on.
00:22:03,00:22:06,It would be excellent for the economy of Scotland.
00:22:06,00:22:07,It would be good.
00:22:07,00:22:10,[LAUGHTER]
00:22:10,00:22:11,A risky comment.
00:22:11,00:22:14,[LAUGHTER]
00:22:14,00:22:18,"Yeah, so this is one of those stories that"
00:22:18,00:22:20,is Thomas Edison as a character.
00:22:20,00:22:25,So clouded in apocryphal stories and legends and so on.
00:22:25,00:22:28,But this was reported in a number of official biographies
00:22:28,00:22:28,by him.
00:22:28,00:22:30,But the story goes that they were trying
00:22:30,00:22:32,to work out how to make the light bulbs
00:22:32,00:22:34,of the original light bulb he was doing
00:22:34,00:22:37,last longer than a few hours or so on.
00:22:37,00:22:38,That was-- they had a limit on it.
00:22:38,00:22:41,"And he tried over supposedly 1,600 things."
00:22:41,00:22:44,"And when it was 1,600 things, it would be like--"
00:22:44,00:22:46,they used like 40 different varieties of bamboo.
00:22:46,00:22:48,"So that would be part of the list, for example."
00:22:48,00:22:50,"There wasn't completely random things,"
00:22:50,00:22:53,like ripping beards off and so on.
00:22:53,00:22:56,But one of the stories from an official biography
00:22:56,00:22:58,"says that a friend of his of old days, who"
00:22:58,00:23:01,"was his boss at a station, at a railroad station,"
00:23:01,00:23:02,"that he worked at when he was younger,"
00:23:02,00:23:04,"called Mr. McKenzie, came in."
00:23:04,00:23:05,He was a really fun character.
00:23:05,00:23:07,"And Edison, as a joke, said, why don't we"
00:23:07,00:23:09,try it with your red beard?
00:23:09,00:23:10,"Took off the strands, put it in."
00:23:10,00:23:11,It did go up.
00:23:11,00:23:13,"And it had a red light, as it went up as well, which"
00:23:13,00:23:15,"was nice, yeah."
00:23:15,00:23:17,"And yeah, so--"
00:23:17,00:23:18,"Actually, when they did that, there"
00:23:18,00:23:20,was a competition between McKenzie
00:23:20,00:23:22,and another guy called John Creucey.
00:23:22,00:23:24,And they wanted to have a competition whose beard
00:23:24,00:23:26,would be best inside the--
00:23:26,00:23:26,"Oh, really?"
00:23:26,00:23:27,Yeah.
00:23:27,00:23:32,"And Creucey, he was Swiss, and he had a big black bushy beard."
00:23:32,00:23:33,"McKenzie was more bristly and straight,"
00:23:33,00:23:35,and they had a competition.
00:23:35,00:23:37,And McKenzie was the winner.
00:23:37,00:23:41,"But actually, they were both pretty shit."
00:23:41,00:23:43,"What was the thing that won, excuse my ignorance,"
00:23:43,00:23:45,"and out of these 1600 things, was it the--"
00:23:45,00:23:48,"Well, now we use what tungsten or something, don't we?"
00:23:48,00:23:48,"Oh, yeah."
00:23:48,00:23:50,But it was bamboo at the time.
00:23:50,00:23:53,"Wasn't it-- oh, sort of a bamboo film, I think, was what he is."
00:23:53,00:23:55,So it was bamboo to start off with.
00:23:55,00:23:59,"He found Japanese bamboo, and he sent a team of explorers"
00:23:59,00:24:02,"to South America, and they found some really good bamboo."
00:24:02,00:24:04,"But then they got confused, and they forgot where they found it."
00:24:04,00:24:06,"So they brought some back, but they couldn't remember"
00:24:06,00:24:08,where they got it from.
00:24:08,00:24:11,So then he had to send another guy called James Recalton
00:24:11,00:24:13,"out to the jungles around the world, actually."
00:24:13,00:24:16,"Sri Lanka, Burma, Malaysia, India, all over."
00:24:16,00:24:20,"For a year, he looked around for the best perfect bamboo."
00:24:20,00:24:22,"And he got to Sri Lanka, and he found this bamboo."
00:24:22,00:24:25,"It was amazing, and it was going to be perfect for the light bulb."
00:24:25,00:24:28,"And he got home to Edison, and he said, I've got this bamboo."
00:24:28,00:24:30,"And Edison said, oh, we're using carbon now."
00:24:30,00:24:31,Oh.
00:24:31,00:24:32,Oh.
00:24:32,00:24:34,And then carbon was the final thing that he used.
00:24:34,00:24:36,That's really harsh.
00:24:36,00:24:38,"Yeah, it's quite funny though."
00:24:38,00:24:40,"You could at least have said, oh, thank you."
00:24:40,00:24:41,This looks great.
00:24:41,00:24:41,Thank you.
00:24:41,00:24:42,Great.
00:24:42,00:24:46,"And then, quietly, he said, we're going to use the carbon."
00:24:46,00:24:48,I'd like to have a few days of thinking he'd won.
00:24:48,00:24:50,"The amazing thing about the carbon, actually,"
00:24:50,00:24:54,that was invented by a guy called Lewis Howard Latimer.
00:24:54,00:24:57,And he was an African-American drassman
00:24:57,00:24:58,who was a son of an escaped slave.
00:24:58,00:25:01,But the amazing thing about him is he
00:25:01,00:25:04,"invented the carbon filament, which made Edison's millions."
00:25:04,00:25:07,But he was also the drassman who drew up the patent
00:25:07,00:25:09,for Alexander Graham Bell's telephone.
00:25:09,00:25:10,Wow.
00:25:10,00:25:12,So he's made those two massive things.
00:25:12,00:25:15,The big rivalry.
00:25:15,00:25:18,"But his light bulb was obviously very revolutionary,"
00:25:18,00:25:21,even though he didn't technically invent the light bulb.
00:25:21,00:25:25,"But I guess he was extremely good at PR, Edison."
00:25:25,00:25:27,"So he had this invention factory, which"
00:25:27,00:25:30,made sure they turned out the best inventions.
00:25:30,00:25:35,And one good PR move he made was in 1884 on Halloween.
00:25:35,00:25:39,"So employees of the Edison Electric Lighting Company,"
00:25:39,00:25:41,they paraded up and down New York
00:25:41,00:25:43,with light bulbs strapped to their heads.
00:25:43,00:25:44,So they all had to--
00:25:44,00:25:46,Everyone thought they were having an amazing idea.
00:25:46,00:25:48,[LAUGHTER]
00:25:48,00:25:51,Maybe that's where that came from.
00:25:51,00:25:52,"But yeah, this is amazing."
00:25:52,00:25:53,"It was a show off the new light bulbs, which"
00:25:53,00:25:54,had just been invented.
00:25:54,00:25:57,And there was a huge horse-drawn generator
00:25:57,00:25:58,in the middle of all these hundreds
00:25:58,00:26:01,"of employees of the factory, horse-drawn generator,"
00:26:01,00:26:04,which changed steam into electricity.
00:26:04,00:26:06,So there's this big kind of steam powered machine
00:26:06,00:26:06,in the middle.
00:26:06,00:26:09,And then hundreds of people who were held together
00:26:09,00:26:11,with wire that was going from the light bulbs
00:26:11,00:26:13,on their heads and down through their sleeves
00:26:13,00:26:15,and then linking them to the next person.
00:26:15,00:26:18,"So kind of like, there's gloves that you wore as a child"
00:26:18,00:26:20,that connected to each other through your chest.
00:26:20,00:26:22,"Oh, yeah, what?"
00:26:22,00:26:23,"Yeah, missions."
00:26:23,00:26:25,"No, I mean around your chest."
00:26:25,00:26:28,[LAUGHTER]
00:26:28,00:26:30,"But yeah, they paraded through New York."
00:26:30,00:26:32,And it was this huge PR thing in the face.
00:26:32,00:26:34,All these people tied together with light bulbs
00:26:34,00:26:35,flashing on their heads.
00:26:35,00:26:38,"So sorry, were they tied together because it was one chain?"
00:26:38,00:26:38,Yes.
00:26:38,00:26:39,It was one circuit.
00:26:39,00:26:41,"Imagine if one of them had gone like in Christmas lights,"
00:26:41,00:26:45,and you'd go to testing every individual employee.
00:26:45,00:26:46,No.
00:26:46,00:26:49,[LAUGHTER]
00:26:49,00:26:52,"He used to do-- so for ideas, he used to do this thing."
00:26:52,00:26:55,"And this again, it's been written in a bunch of biographies."
00:26:55,00:26:56,And a lot of people think that this really happened.
00:26:56,00:26:58,We're not sure.
00:26:58,00:26:59,"He used to, when he was falling asleep,"
00:26:59,00:27:01,he thought that's when he had his best ideas.
00:27:01,00:27:03,"And he would think, I would have the idea."
00:27:03,00:27:06,"And then I'd fall asleep, and I'd wake up later and go,"
00:27:06,00:27:07,"oh, what was that amazing idea?"
00:27:07,00:27:10,So he used to take naps during the day on a chair.
00:27:10,00:27:13,"And in his hand, he would hold metallic balls,"
00:27:13,00:27:16,"just two metal balls, with a metal plate underneath him."
00:27:16,00:27:18,So as he was going into that zone where he was having an idea
00:27:18,00:27:21,"as he was going into a nap, his hand would go loose"
00:27:21,00:27:22,when he fell into the sleep.
00:27:22,00:27:25,"The ball would land in the plate, wake him up,"
00:27:25,00:27:28,"and he could immediately go, ah, that idea is amazing,"
00:27:28,00:27:29,"and write it down, and have it."
00:27:29,00:27:32,And no one's officially said that that's definitely
00:27:32,00:27:34,the case of how he did that.
00:27:34,00:27:36,"But there's a famous statue in Florida of him,"
00:27:36,00:27:38,which people always go and visit.
00:27:38,00:27:41,"And in his hand is a metal ball, which"
00:27:41,00:27:44,gives a little nod to the fact that they think it was true.
00:27:44,00:27:45,That's cool.
00:27:45,00:27:47,"Yeah, he was famous for taking naps,"
00:27:47,00:27:50,"because he said that sleep was rubbish,"
00:27:50,00:27:51,and no one needed that much.
00:27:51,00:27:52,And he said he only had three hours sleep a night.
00:27:52,00:27:55,"But there were all these photos of him with Henry Ford,"
00:27:55,00:27:56,who was one of his best friends of Ford fame.
00:27:56,00:28:00,There were all these photos of him sleep.
00:28:00,00:28:03,"Henry Ford's really often awake, and he's just having a nap"
00:28:03,00:28:06,"in the background, just like constant catnaps."
00:28:06,00:28:08,And they work close him and Henry Ford.
00:28:08,00:28:09,"They were super close, yeah."
00:28:09,00:28:12,It's like proper BFFs for life.
00:28:12,00:28:13,They went on camping trips together.
00:28:13,00:28:14,Yeah.
00:28:14,00:28:17,They went-- so Edison became confined to a wheelchair
00:28:17,00:28:21,"in his later life, and Ford bought a wheelchair for himself,"
00:28:21,00:28:22,so they could have wheelchair races.
00:28:22,00:28:24,"Yeah, no way."
00:28:24,00:28:25,"Yeah, that's pretty sweet."
00:28:25,00:28:28,"And there's a thing which is quite famous,"
00:28:28,00:28:30,"but maybe a lot of people haven't heard, which"
00:28:30,00:28:33,"was when he died, they captured."
00:28:33,00:28:34,They were said to do this.
00:28:34,00:28:37,"And it was handed over to Henry Ford by Edison's son,"
00:28:37,00:28:39,the last breath of Thomas Edison.
00:28:39,00:28:41,So they had these little test tubes.
00:28:41,00:28:43,And there was eight of them that were sitting along there.
00:28:43,00:28:45,Breathe this last breath.
00:28:45,00:28:47,They put in the cork afterwards.
00:28:47,00:28:49,"And if you go to this day to the Henry Ford museum,"
00:28:49,00:28:51,he has the test tube on display.
00:28:51,00:28:55,"But yeah, you don't know which is going to be the last breath."
00:28:55,00:28:57,They must've been said that for a long time.
00:28:57,00:28:58,Yeah.
00:28:58,00:28:59,"For months, maybe."
00:28:59,00:29:01,You just wait that they wait for the test tube
00:29:01,00:29:03,"and say, here's the last--"
00:29:03,00:29:05,"the second last breath of the day, all right."
00:29:05,00:29:06,The third last breath.
00:29:06,00:29:08,Final test tube.
00:29:08,00:29:09,"Yeah, I don't know."
00:29:09,00:29:11,It's impossible.
00:29:11,00:29:12,It's in a museum.
00:29:12,00:29:13,Yeah.
00:29:13,00:29:15,"This won't go in, but I'll just quickly say it"
00:29:15,00:29:16,because I read it today.
00:29:16,00:29:18,I read the last words of Rol Dahl.
00:29:18,00:29:21,"And Rol Dahl's last words, he was surrounded by his family."
00:29:21,00:29:22,He was very ill.
00:29:22,00:29:26,"And his final words were, the thing I'm"
00:29:26,00:29:28,going to miss most is being with all of you.
00:29:28,00:29:29,I was his final words.
00:29:29,00:29:31,"And then he went down, except it wasn't quite"
00:29:31,00:29:33,"his last words, because the nurse who"
00:29:33,00:29:35,"was with him thought, I'll make it easy on him"
00:29:35,00:29:38,and gave him a shot of morphine to make it go easy on the way out.
00:29:38,00:29:42,"But as she did it, he went, oh, fuck!"
00:29:42,00:29:44,And those were Rol Dahl's last words.
00:29:44,00:29:47,It's brilliant.
00:29:47,00:29:50,"OK, it is time for our final fact of the show."
00:29:50,00:29:52,And that is Andrew Hunter Murray.
00:29:52,00:29:55,My fact is that it's only worth leaning over to pick up
00:29:55,00:29:59,a 1P coin if you can do it in less than three seconds.
00:29:59,00:30:00,Anything more than that?
00:30:00,00:30:01,Waste of time.
00:30:01,00:30:02,Move on.
00:30:02,00:30:04,I reckon I could do it in that time.
00:30:04,00:30:05,I'm sure you could.
00:30:05,00:30:07,I'm sure you could.
00:30:07,00:30:09,But you'd have to do it pretty much every three seconds
00:30:09,00:30:12,for it to be worth me giving up my job.
00:30:12,00:30:13,You would.
00:30:13,00:30:14,"Yes, yeah."
00:30:14,00:30:17,"This basically applies if you're on the median UK salary,"
00:30:17,00:30:20,which is £539 a week.
00:30:20,00:30:26,"And if you do that, assuming you work a 40-hour week,"
00:30:26,00:30:29,"9 to 6 with an hour for lunch, let's say,"
00:30:29,00:30:31,you've got 2.6 seconds to do it.
00:30:31,00:30:32,OK.
00:30:32,00:30:35,"Now, the problem is, if you are more than that, obviously,"
00:30:35,00:30:38,you have to do it a lot faster to make an economical exercise
00:30:38,00:30:39,for you.
00:30:39,00:30:42,"So the Prime Minister, based on her current salary,"
00:30:42,00:30:45,"I have assumed the 60-hour week for her, because she is busy."
00:30:45,00:30:52,"But I haven't given her an hour for lunch, don't worry."
00:30:52,00:30:55,"She would have to do it in 0.5 seconds, which is quite hard."
00:30:55,00:30:57,That's tough.
00:30:57,00:31:00,I've worked it out for Cristiano Ronaldo as well.
00:31:00,00:31:04,"On his current salary, he would have to do it in 0.0.2 seconds."
00:31:04,00:31:09,And he would have to pick up 391 every second to make it work as well.
00:31:09,00:31:11,"He is quick, though."
00:31:11,00:31:12,He is quick.
00:31:12,00:31:12,Yeah.
00:31:12,00:31:16,"I worked it out for Philip Hammond, based on his independent"
00:31:16,00:31:18,article that estimated his income.
00:31:18,00:31:20,So this is not just his salary.
00:31:20,00:31:22,It's all of the money that comes in for him.
00:31:22,00:31:26,"And he would have to be able to pick it up in 0.2 seconds,"
00:31:26,00:31:29,"which is, coincidentally, the limit of human reaction time."
00:31:29,00:31:34,"So he would have to immediately notice it, pick it up without any movement,"
00:31:34,00:31:37,"just notice it, pick it up, notice it, pick it up."
00:31:37,00:31:40,"Basically, that's the fastest anyone can possibly pick up coins."
00:31:40,00:31:41,"I reckon, wow."
00:31:41,00:31:45,"But if he did that, he really would not be getting on with the job,"
00:31:45,00:31:46,but he-- and it is an important job he's got.
00:31:46,00:31:49,"I would say he should focus on being Chancellor,"
00:31:49,00:31:52,and then leave the coin picking to Theresa May.
00:31:52,00:31:54,[LAUGHTER]
00:31:54,00:31:56,Maybe that's what she's been doing.
00:31:56,00:31:59,"It's a strong plan for Brexit Britain, because it's"
00:31:59,00:32:01,looking for any coins we can find.
00:32:01,00:32:04,[LAUGHTER]
00:32:04,00:32:06,"We've got no trade deals, but has anyone"
00:32:06,00:32:07,looked behind the sofa?
00:32:07,00:32:09,[LAUGHTER]
00:32:09,00:32:16,"But this is partly about how the 1P is silly,"
00:32:16,00:32:18,but it's not worth very much at all.
00:32:18,00:32:21,"And there's a lot of talk of getting rid of it, right?"
00:32:21,00:32:25,So I think it's basically not worth picking it up at any point.
00:32:25,00:32:30,You're not even allowed to pay with 1P's in more than 20 1P's.
00:32:30,00:32:32,So I--
00:32:32,00:32:34,"So if something's 22P, you can't pay with just 1P's."
00:32:34,00:32:37,"Yeah, and I've broken the law on multiple occasions."
00:32:37,00:32:40,"Well, it's not a law, per se."
00:32:40,00:32:42,It's that they don't have to accept it as legal tender.
00:32:42,00:32:43,Yes.
00:32:43,00:32:45,"But if you're in one of those self-service places,"
00:32:45,00:32:48,"and you can just put them in really quickly before they notice,"
00:32:48,00:32:50,"then you can do as many as you want, actually."
00:32:50,00:32:53,"So yeah, there is an idea of getting rid of the 1P's and the 2P's."
00:32:53,00:32:55,And I think Jar Jarzban wanted to do it.
00:32:55,00:32:56,Didn't he when he was Chancellor?
00:32:56,00:32:58,"But David Cameron said we shouldn't,"
00:32:58,00:33:01,because everyone all voters out.
00:33:01,00:33:04,And the amount of money you pay to make them
00:33:04,00:33:06,is more than what they're worth.
00:33:06,00:33:10,It's something like six out of 10 UK 1P and 2P's
00:33:10,00:33:13,are only used once and then put in a jar.
00:33:13,00:33:17,"And then 1 in 12, the kinds of thrown into the bin immediately."
00:33:17,00:33:19,"And at one stage, the role meant"
00:33:19,00:33:21,was having to make 500 million 1P and 2P
00:33:21,00:33:25,coins every year to replace those were going out of circulation.
00:33:25,00:33:28,I do not believe anyone throws 1P coins into the bin.
00:33:28,00:33:31,Does anyone here throw coins just into the bin?
00:33:31,00:33:33,"What it's 12 people do, so--"
00:33:33,00:33:36,"No, in a charity box or into a jar."
00:33:36,00:33:38,Straight in the bin.
00:33:38,00:33:40,"No, it's not maniac."
00:33:40,00:33:41,But I've been tempted.
00:33:41,00:33:43,"It's completely insane, man."
00:33:43,00:33:45,"OK, so did you say 500 million a year?"
00:33:45,00:33:45,Yeah.
00:33:45,00:33:50,Guess how many pennies the UK made in the year 1933?
00:33:50,00:33:51,Cut.
00:33:51,00:33:54,It's the worst game show ever.
00:33:54,00:33:55,A billion.
00:33:55,00:33:57,Seven.
00:33:57,00:33:59,How are we so close?
00:33:59,00:34:02,They made seven pennies for the whole year.
00:34:02,00:34:03,What?
00:34:03,00:34:04,Why did they do that?
00:34:04,00:34:06,Because they had loads already hit us.
00:34:06,00:34:07,So these are seven.
00:34:07,00:34:09,"But seven is a strange number, isn't it?"
00:34:09,00:34:10,You would think zero.
00:34:10,00:34:13,Why would you need so more?
00:34:13,00:34:15,Get the machines back up and running.
00:34:15,00:34:18,Does anyone have seven P?
00:34:18,00:34:20,"OK, the reason for it was"
00:34:20,00:34:21,because I think the men didn't want to miss a year.
00:34:21,00:34:23,They didn't want to have a year in which they did not make
00:34:23,00:34:25,one of the coins at the realm.
00:34:25,00:34:26,So they made seven--
00:34:26,00:34:26,"Oh, wait a minute."
00:34:26,00:34:28,They must be really rare.
00:34:28,00:34:28,That's so rare.
00:34:28,00:34:31,"So this is even rare, because three of them"
00:34:31,00:34:33,were placed by the king under the foundation
00:34:33,00:34:36,"stones of important buildings, OK?"
00:34:36,00:34:39,"Two went to the British Museum, two went into private hands."
00:34:39,00:34:41,What's buildings do we know what they are?
00:34:41,00:34:41,I don't know.
00:34:41,00:34:44,I think it probably is known.
00:34:44,00:34:46,There are four prototypes coins as well.
00:34:46,00:34:51,"One of those in 2016 sold for 72,000 pounds."
00:34:51,00:34:52,Wow.
00:34:52,00:34:54,They're so rare that people start modifying
00:34:54,00:34:57,"a 1935 coins, because they can most easily be adapted"
00:34:57,00:35:00,and made to look like a 33 penny.
00:35:00,00:35:04,"So if you do find one of those, do hang on to it."
00:35:04,00:35:07,"They used to, in the eighth century, they had pennies,"
00:35:07,00:35:10,but they didn't have-- because things would cost less
00:35:10,00:35:10,than a penny.
00:35:10,00:35:12,So what they ended up doing was just they
00:35:12,00:35:14,would chop the pennies in half.
00:35:14,00:35:15,"So if you were at a shop, you'd be like,"
00:35:15,00:35:16,I need some change.
00:35:16,00:35:18,And they would just slice your penny into
00:35:18,00:35:20,and give you either the quarter of a half that they--
00:35:20,00:35:22,"We had pennies as well, didn't we, half pennies?"
00:35:22,00:35:23,Yeah.
00:35:23,00:35:25,"Sorry, pennies were--"
00:35:25,00:35:27,they came about from the chopping in half.
00:35:27,00:35:29,"And actually, the design of coins in that period,"
00:35:29,00:35:31,"like the eighth century, around--"
00:35:31,00:35:35,and then in the 1200s Henry II introduced
00:35:35,00:35:37,what was called the long cross coin.
00:35:37,00:35:39,"And it was a coin where the cross figured on it,"
00:35:39,00:35:41,"the Christian cross, went probably from top to bottom"
00:35:41,00:35:42,and from right to left.
00:35:42,00:35:44,And that was to make it easier to cut.
00:35:44,00:35:46,"And so that was if you could give change,"
00:35:46,00:35:47,"you could give it more easily, because you could just"
00:35:47,00:35:48,break it up.
00:35:48,00:35:49,And then that's where--
00:35:49,00:35:51,"Actually, that's where pieces of eight"
00:35:51,00:35:52,"comes from as well, isn't it?"
00:35:52,00:35:53,"Oh, really?"
00:35:53,00:35:55,"Because you were saying before about piece of foreign,"
00:35:55,00:35:57,"whatever, the piece of eight was you would have a coin"
00:35:57,00:35:58,and you would cut it into eight pieces.
00:35:58,00:36:01,And that's why a quarter is called two bits in America.
00:36:01,00:36:03,What have they made of?
00:36:03,00:36:05,That you could chop it so easily.
00:36:05,00:36:06,Metal.
00:36:06,00:36:08,"Soft metals, specifically silver."
00:36:08,00:36:09,"Silver and gold are quite soft, aren't they?"
00:36:09,00:36:10,"Yeah, exactly."
00:36:10,00:36:11,And this is--
00:36:11,00:36:14,"That's why if you get a gold medal and you bite it,"
00:36:14,00:36:16,"to prove whether it's real gold on that,"
00:36:16,00:36:18,"to prove it's gold, it's not harder, it's softer."
00:36:18,00:36:20,"So if you bite something that's made out of gold,"
00:36:20,00:36:22,you should get little teeth marks in it.
00:36:22,00:36:23,Yeah.
00:36:23,00:36:24,OK.
00:36:24,00:36:26,"Unless it leaves really big teeth marks, in which case,"
00:36:26,00:36:27,it's a chocolate coin.
00:36:27,00:36:28,Yeah.
00:36:28,00:36:31,[LAUGHTER]
00:36:31,00:36:32,"Don't be fooled again, Dan."
00:36:32,00:36:35,[LAUGHTER]
00:36:35,00:36:37,Just on that--
00:36:37,00:36:39,so people used to chop little bits off the edges of coins.
00:36:39,00:36:40,And that was a really bad crime.
00:36:40,00:36:42,"And it had very severe punishments,"
00:36:42,00:36:44,because obviously it's devaluing the coin on the realm.
00:36:44,00:36:46,"But people used to do it anyway, because you"
00:36:46,00:36:48,can melt down the silver and recast it.
00:36:48,00:36:51,"And in 2015, again, a horde of silver clippings"
00:36:51,00:36:53,was found in a field in Gloucestershire
00:36:53,00:36:55,by someone with a metal detector.
00:36:55,00:36:59,And it was a huge bundle of shaved off coins.
00:36:59,00:37:00,And I just love the name it's been given.
00:37:00,00:37:02,It was called the toenail horde.
00:37:02,00:37:05,Because it looks all these little round
00:37:05,00:37:06,trebings of coins.
00:37:06,00:37:07,They look like a tas of them.
00:37:07,00:37:08,That's amazing.
00:37:08,00:37:10,That's why coins have got milling on the side of it.
00:37:10,00:37:13,"So little kind of indentations on the side of every coin,"
00:37:13,00:37:16,"if you look at it, that's to stop people from shaving off."
00:37:16,00:37:18,"And that was invented by a think Isaac Newton, who"
00:37:18,00:37:21,"was the master of the mint, as well as doing all the other stuff"
00:37:21,00:37:22,he did.
00:37:22,00:37:23,"It's such a good name, isn't it?"
00:37:23,00:37:25,Yeah.
00:37:25,00:37:26,Here's another idea.
00:37:26,00:37:28,"Get rid of one piece, two piece, five piece, ten piece,"
00:37:28,00:37:30,and 50 piece.
00:37:30,00:37:35,"And instead have one piece, three piece, 11 piece, and 37 piece."
00:37:35,00:37:37,You've gone mad.
00:37:37,00:37:37,Yeah.
00:37:37,00:37:39,"It's just maths, Andy."
00:37:39,00:37:39,It's just maths.
00:37:39,00:37:42,"If you have those coins, then it makes it easier"
00:37:42,00:37:45,for any kind of combination of coins
00:37:45,00:37:48,"to be used for any number of any price, basically."
00:37:48,00:37:49,37 piece.
00:37:49,00:37:52,"Yeah, because they're all prime numbers, so apart from one."
00:37:52,00:37:55,But they're all kind of prime numbers.
00:37:55,00:37:56,"One's kind of a prime number, isn't it?"
00:37:56,00:37:59,"Oh, we're going to get somebody like that."
00:37:59,00:38:03,"But basically, it means that say something's 76 p or 84 p,"
00:38:03,00:38:06,it's just easier to work out with that specific number
00:38:06,00:38:10,"of things. On average, it's 4.1 coins per transaction,"
00:38:10,00:38:12,"compared to 1p, 2p, and 5p and 7."
00:38:12,00:38:14,So there will be 37 p coins.
00:38:14,00:38:15,That's so hard to work out.
00:38:15,00:38:17,"No, you get used to it pretty quick."
00:38:17,00:38:20,"Now, if you had to learn your 37 times table,"
00:38:20,00:38:22,just to pay for stuff.
00:38:22,00:38:27,You're the first person who introduced the penny to the UK.
00:38:27,00:38:29,So this is also in the 8th century.
00:38:29,00:38:31,And this is King Offer of Mercia.
00:38:31,00:38:34,"So 8th century, he made the first penny in the UK."
00:38:34,00:38:36,"And the incredible thing about this, which"
00:38:36,00:38:36,I just love.
00:38:36,00:38:38,And I learn when I went to the British Museum.
00:38:38,00:38:42,And I saw an example of one of his early gold coins.
00:38:42,00:38:43,Is this?
00:38:43,00:38:45,So only three gold coins from his reign
00:38:45,00:38:48,"survived, so the introduce of the penny to Britain."
00:38:48,00:38:55,And he was a Christian King and the phrase around this gold
00:38:55,00:38:57,"coin in the British Museum is, there"
00:38:57,00:38:59,is no God but Allah alone.
00:38:59,00:39:00,And it is because--
00:39:00,00:39:01,Oh.
00:39:01,00:39:03,It's so incredible.
00:39:03,00:39:05,"So it was just a century after Muhammad, basically."
00:39:05,00:39:09,And the Abbasid Caliphs were taking over large parts of Europe.
00:39:09,00:39:12,"And he wanted to be-- well, we're not entirely sure why"
00:39:12,00:39:12,the coin said this.
00:39:12,00:39:16,But one theory is that he wanted to be able to trade with them.
00:39:16,00:39:17,And they would see these coins as valuable.
00:39:17,00:39:20,"They would recognize that and think, yeah, you're one of us."
00:39:20,00:39:21,That's fine.
00:39:21,00:39:22,"But then a lot of other people think, actually,"
00:39:22,00:39:24,he just didn't speak Arabic.
00:39:24,00:39:26,And he had no idea what those words meant.
00:39:26,00:39:27,And he's a Christian King.
00:39:27,00:39:28,He accidentally wrote on his coins.
00:39:28,00:39:29,There's no God but Allah alone.
00:39:29,00:39:33,It's like a tattoo with some old kind of Japanese characters.
00:39:33,00:39:38,"And it actually says, you English Winker."
00:39:38,00:39:42,Do you know what the least valuable coin in the world is?
00:39:42,00:39:44,It's an Uzbek coin.
00:39:44,00:39:47,And it's the one Tegan coin.
00:39:47,00:39:50,"If you had 3,000 of them, you would have one penny."
00:39:50,00:39:52,That's an extreme way to use it as one penny.
00:39:52,00:39:59,"And I worked out that Ronaldo, if he wanted to make a profit,"
00:39:59,00:40:03,"would have to pick up 1 million and 173,000"
00:40:03,00:40:07,and Tegan every second.
00:40:07,00:40:08,"He is fast, though."
00:40:08,00:40:12,"OK, let's wrap up, guys."

00:40:45,00:40:47,"And we're about to give one away, actually,"
00:40:47,00:40:50,to a member of the audience who sent an effect to us
00:40:50,00:40:51,at the beginning of the show.
00:40:51,00:40:54,"So for a cassette, Andy, what's the winning fact?"
00:40:54,00:40:57,The winning fact comes from someone called Julien Mazet.
00:40:57,00:41:00,"I hope I'm pronouncing the name right, and it's this."
00:41:00,00:41:01,It's about the city we're in.
00:41:01,00:41:04,It's that Glasgow was once voted the friendliest
00:41:04,00:41:08,and the most dangerous city in the UK in the same year.
00:41:08,00:41:18,"OK, that's it."
