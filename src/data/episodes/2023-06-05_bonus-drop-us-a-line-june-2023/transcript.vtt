00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:03.260
 [speaking Japanese]

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:10.660
 [music]

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:11.360
 Hi!

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:12.660
 - Hi, Andy. - Hello, Andy.

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:13.500
 Hi, guys.

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.760
 And hello to you, the listener and member of Club Fish.

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.700
 Welcome to Drop Us Align.

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:23.560
 You're occasional, I was going to say monthly,

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:25.260
 but sometimes it moves around a bit,

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.960
 your sporadic post-bag episode where we talk about the facts

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:31.060
 that you've sent in to us,

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:32.400
 the challenges that you've sent,

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:35.060
 the factual errors that we might have to defend ourselves

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:37.760
 against accusations of having made.

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:38.620
 That's the show.

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:40.200
 [laughs]

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.060
 Right, so let's get into the post-bag.

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:44.400
 Here's a good one to start off.

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:45.960
 This is great, it's from John.

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.000
 - Hi, John. - Hello, John.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.860
 John Jenkins, great name.

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:51.060
 John writes, "Hi, elves.

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:53.520
 "Did the claim that James Garfield was fed

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.160
 "through his anus first episode query?"

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:59.860
 - You know what, Andy, can I just say?

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:02.100
 You're very keen for us to do these Drop Us Aligns

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.220
 quite regularly because you're worried

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:06.060
 that we might start talking about episodes

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.760
 that people don't remember very well,

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:09.860
 like from maybe a month ago.

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:11.960
 But it turns out you got one from nine years ago.

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:13.260
 - Yeah, this has got a special place to mark.

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.360
 I think 'cause we talk about President Garfield so much.

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:16.900
 - Well, no, the Anna episode as well.

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:19.400
 We played that in as a section. - Oh, did we?

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.400
 - I believe we did, and that was about four months ago.

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:23.260
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - So, okay.

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.560
 John writes, "So basically, we had this claim

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.360
 "that President Garfield, for the last three months

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.260
 "of his life, ate everything for the day.

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:30.820
 "'Cause he'd been shot and he was on his stomach

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:32.260
 "and he couldn't, yeah, okay.

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:33.660
 "Did the claim that James Garfield was fed

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:35.220
 "through his anus, get officially debunked

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.200
 "on no such thing as a fish?

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.000
 "Because chat GPT has warned me

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.160
 "quite passive aggressively about believing

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:44.160
 "or spreading false information.

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:46.600
 "And he's appended a screenshot

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:49.100
 "of a chat he had with chat GPT."

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:50.860
 Right, so John says, "James Garfield ate

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:53.160
 "through his anus to chat GPT."

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:54.900
 And chat GPT writes back,

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:56.960
 "That claim is not based on any factual information

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:58.860
 "and is not supported by any credible sources.

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.560
 "James Garfield was the 20th President

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:02.300
 "of the United States and he did not eat

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:03.760
 "through his anus.

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:06.000
 "He was assassinated in 1881 and blah, blah, blah.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.660
 "And so he wrote, and he wrote again,

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:09.100
 "like, where did the claim come from then?

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:11.960
 "And chat GPT writes back,

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:13.860
 "there is a persistent urban legend

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.660
 "that James Garfield was fed through his rectum

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:16.700
 "after being shot in the back.

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:19.460
 "It's completely unfounded, it has no basis in fact,

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:21.500
 "and is not supported by any credible sources."

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:24.860
 So, John was very concerned and wrote to us

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:28.000
 and it absolutely is true.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.560
 - So, as in John is susted out

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:32.000
 or you've gone off to do extra research?

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.940
 - Well, I've gone off and looked into it a bit more.

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:35.660
 It hasn't been debunked, it's absolutely true.

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:37.100
 - Okay, well, this is what's happened here.

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:38.300
 It's really clear.

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:42.780
 A few episodes ago, you came up with a chat GPT version

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:46.260
 of "No Such Things as a Fish" and it really, really sucked.

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:50.020
 And probably chat GPT in his newfound sentience

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:51.260
 has heard that and thought,

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:52.100
 "You know what?

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:54.460
 "I'm gonna bring these guys down a peg or two."

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:56.180
 And so, he's decided to do this.

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:57.460
 - Oh, yeah, right.

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:59.340
 Crumble it from Ep 1.

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:01.660
 It's like taking a Jenga block out from the bottom

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:03.700
 or all three, top of the whole thing.

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:04.900
 - Do you wanna hear a Jenga fact?

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:06.420
 - Yeah.

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:07.700
 - In the game of Jenga,

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:10.020
 the official original rules of Jenga,

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:13.580
 no two Jenga blocks are exactly identical.

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:15.020
 They all have to be slightly different.

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.860
 - You're kidding.

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:16.700
 - Uh-uh.

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:17.540
 - What?

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:18.380
 Okay, that's mind-blowing.

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:20.380
 - So, the reason being that when you stack them up,

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:22.060
 if they were all identical,

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:24.300
 then they would stack perfectly

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:26.860
 and it would be a boring game

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:28.380
 'cause you wouldn't be able to push any of them out.

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:29.740
 - So, is the original or still?

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:32.020
 - I think it's still, but it was definitely the original.

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:34.420
 And so, they have very, very slight flaws in them,

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:36.620
 which means that they're not quite standing

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:37.460
 on top of each other,

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:39.260
 which means that the friction doesn't hold them in place.

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.700
 - So, every block is unique.

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:42.700
 A spoke, Jenga. - Nice, isn't it?

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:44.660
 It's a nice, you know, it's nice.

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:46.300
 - Is it someone just standing by the machine

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:47.220
 doing the woodblock cutting,

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:50.580
 just nudging it every time the block goes in?

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:53.940
 - Anyway, so just to go back to the Garfield thing,

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:57.260
 I found this amazing article on medium.com

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.180
 all about the doctor.

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:00.020
 Do you remember he was called?

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:01.380
 His first name was Doctor. - Doctor Willard Bliss.

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:03.300
 - Doctor Doctor Willard Bliss, exactly.

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:05.660
 And it has incredibly detailed information

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:06.500
 about the rectal feeding,

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:08.580
 which I don't think we ever covered in the first episode.

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:11.060
 He wrote a pamphlet, Doctor Bliss,

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:12.340
 a year after Garfield died,

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:14.620
 which is called Feeding Per Rectum,

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:15.860
 as illustrated in the case

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:17.580
 of the late president Garfield and others.

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:18.420
 - Wow.

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:19.260
 - And it endorsed the method,

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:20.660
 it had notes on how it had been used,

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:22.260
 and it had all these detailed notes

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.260
 about what he'd been fed.

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:25.940
 - I gave Anna for her birthday

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:30.180
 a leaflet from Doctor Doctor Willard Bliss.

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:31.660
 So they handed some out,

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:33.580
 like when Garfield died,

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:35.540
 they handed out a lot of leaflets to the crowd,

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:37.460
 saying that the president is dead.

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:39.700
 And they're still extant, you can still buy them.

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:40.540
 - Wow. - And I bought Anna one

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:42.100
 for her birthday once. - It's very nice.

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:42.940
 - That's amazing.

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:44.620
 - Well, if you want to, for the next birthday,

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:46.980
 you can buy a copy of this pamphlet.

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:48.060
 - Oh, we've just missed it.

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:49.900
 - Yeah. - Oh, well.

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:50.740
 - It's a bit odd though,

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:53.140
 because it's suggesting it, but the patient dies.

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:55.380
 So it's, the method, I guess he's saying,

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:56.220
 is what works here.

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:57.060
 - He's saying the method is good,

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:58.220
 and he has all these notes about what was fed.

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:01.060
 I don't think we cover the fact that fresh cow's blood

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:02.660
 was issued as a food,

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:05.820
 like a kind of very irony smoothie.

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:07.180
 - No, we didn't.

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:08.420
 Squirrel soup we did.

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:09.260
 - Yeah. - Yeah.

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:12.300
 - Eggs that were causing annoying flatus.

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:13.140
 - Yes.

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:14.300
 - Wasn't there a flaming something?

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:16.380
 - A flaming sambuca, yeah, that was a,

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:17.740
 yeah, very badly wrong.

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:21.940
 - On this subject of chat GPT and other bots.

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:22.900
 - Yeah.

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:25.020
 - We did a fact about, I can't remember,

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:27.020
 I don't think it was explicitly about Alexa,

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:30.060
 but it was kind of about Alexa the other day.

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:34.360
 And I found out that you can go on to askalexa.com

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:35.200
 or something like that,

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:38.180
 and you can put in your own answers to questions.

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:39.020
 - Okay.

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:41.020
 - So it helps Alexa to work,

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:42.540
 because it gives you all the answers.

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:44.980
 You know, you never know what people are gonna ask.

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:46.340
 It's not a chat bot,

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:49.340
 so it needs to be fed the questions and fed the answers.

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:52.140
 And I fed the answer to,

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:54.420
 is there a such thing as a fish?

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:55.500
 Because until that point,

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:57.420
 if you said is there such thing as a fish,

00:05:57.420 --> 00:05:59.900
 you said yes, a fish is an animal,

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:03.220
 which has fins and a backbone and blah, blah, blah.

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:08.100
 And so I fed in according to biologist Steven J. Gould,

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:09.460
 there is no such thing as a fish

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:11.880
 because a hagfish is more closely related

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:14.580
 to a human than a salmon.

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:15.420
 Oh, whatever it was.

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:16.240
 I can't remember what I said.

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:18.300
 - You've done this for anyone asking their Alexa.

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:21.660
 - So I did, and I got an email back from Alexa saying,

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:23.060
 this is now in the system,

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:25.100
 but then I tried it the other day and it didn't work.

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:27.980
 So if everyone listening to this can ask their Alexa.

00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:28.820
 - Check it out right now.

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:30.420
 - Check it out and see if it's in there,

00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:31.580
 'cause it says that it's in there,

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:32.940
 but it doesn't seem to be doing it.

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:35.380
 - Well, we're well done for doing that bit of viral marketing.

00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:36.380
 - We could probably do it right now.

00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:39.740
 I bet someone's like, Alexa, is there such thing as a fish?

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:43.740
 Someone's house that would have just sent it off just then.

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:44.700
 - Brilliant. - That's great.

00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:45.540
 - See, that's the kind of thing

00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:46.840
 that's gonna keep us ahead of the competition

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:47.880
 in podcast terms.

00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:51.040
 - Absolutely, Alexa, "Buy Everything to Play For"

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:54.600
 by James Harkin and Anna Tyshinski from amazon.com.

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:56.880
 Sorry, just while we're doing that.

00:06:56.880 --> 00:06:58.960
 - Absolutely, get it in.

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:00.560
 It's pre-order, we should add.

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:01.400
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:02.220
 - But if you want a book now,

00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:05.520
 Alexa, "Buy the Theory of Everything Else" by Dan Shriver.

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:07.320
 - Well, yeah, but I just feel like that's,

00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:08.200
 they're all a bit non-fiction.

00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:09.600
 People might want something a bit different.

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:12.500
 Alexa, "Buy the Sanctuary" by Andrew Hunter Murray.

00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:15.300
 - Right, can we move on?

00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:17.140
 Can we move on from plugging our own personal endeavors?

00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:19.340
 - Can I say that it's about your book?

00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:20.420
 You absolutely can't say that.

00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:23.820
 - Well, no, it's about, no, no, it's about my audio book.

00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:24.940
 Oh my God. - No, come on.

00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:28.420
 - No, chatGPT, the three of us had a chat with someone

00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:29.800
 who was telling us about the dangers

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:31.060
 of what's going on with it right now.

00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:32.140
 It's getting really scary

00:07:32.140 --> 00:07:35.300
 because it's kind of using global information.

00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:37.580
 It's using the hive mind to answer questions

00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:40.220
 that maybe shouldn't be answered and getting a bit scary.

00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:41.900
 So there was a story the other day.

00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:42.900
 I don't know if you guys saw this

00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:45.280
 where chatGPT was given a challenge

00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:47.880
 in order to do a task online.

00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:49.520
 And the only thing stepping in its way

00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:51.640
 was the fact that it had a capture.

00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:53.800
 So it had one of those things where you have to identify

00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:54.840
 where the-- - The traffic lights are.

00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:56.240
 - The traffic lights are and so on.

00:07:56.240 --> 00:07:58.520
 Robots can't do it, AI can't do it, impossible.

00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:01.000
 So that's the bit where chatGPT stops.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:02.560
 Except chatGPT looked about

00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:04.360
 how you get around something like that,

00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:08.200
 hired a human from TaskRabbit or one of those sites

00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:10.160
 who then did the capture for it

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:12.280
 and then it got in to complete the task.

00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:14.060
 - So the robots-- - That's clever.

00:08:14.060 --> 00:08:14.900
 - They're coming.

00:08:14.900 --> 00:08:16.380
 - You said chatGPT too.

00:08:16.380 --> 00:08:17.740
 - I said P. - No, you said B.

00:08:17.740 --> 00:08:20.620
 It sounded like a rubbish British version of chatGPT.

00:08:20.620 --> 00:08:21.460
 (laughing)

00:08:21.460 --> 00:08:23.340
 - It answers everything with a, ooh, hello!

00:08:23.340 --> 00:08:24.580
 (laughing)

00:08:24.580 --> 00:08:26.580
 - Or is it like GB News?

00:08:26.580 --> 00:08:28.180
 They reply with everything going,

00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:30.380
 "Oh, yeah, but what about Starmer, eh?"

00:08:30.380 --> 00:08:32.460
 - More like the Plandemic, yeah.

00:08:32.460 --> 00:08:35.340
 Right, come on, let's do some emails, let's do some emails.

00:08:35.340 --> 00:08:36.740
 Right, we got an email, this is very exciting,

00:08:36.740 --> 00:08:38.100
 from Duncan Pierce.

00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:39.100
 - Oh, that is exciting.

00:08:39.100 --> 00:08:40.420
 - Yeah, well it is.

00:08:40.420 --> 00:08:43.440
 'Cause the subject line is Spicy Meat.

00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:44.280
 - Oh, right.

00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:45.120
 - Ooh.

00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:45.940
 - You messaged us about this,

00:08:45.940 --> 00:08:47.560
 we said not to open it, but you went there.

00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:48.560
 - Yeah. - Exciting, okay.

00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:51.280
 - Spicy Meat was something we introduced

00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:53.200
 on the last episode of the podcast.

00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:55.960
 - And it means like what inside knowledge about--

00:08:55.960 --> 00:08:58.520
 - No, no, no, that's just meat.

00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:02.560
 This is Spicy Meat about dangerous or forbidden topics.

00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:03.560
 - Oh, okay. - You know what I mean?

00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:04.400
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, sure.

00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:06.160
 - Or controversial stuff.

00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:09.000
 Let's see, I mean, see how spicy you think this meat is.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.940
 Hello, he says, he's picked up the lingo.

00:09:11.940 --> 00:09:14.980
 I have a slice of spicy meat I would like to share.

00:09:14.980 --> 00:09:16.500
 On the latest episode of Drop As A Line,

00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:18.140
 so we're inceptioning ourselves here,

00:09:18.140 --> 00:09:19.380
 you mentioned that people often think

00:09:19.380 --> 00:09:22.820
 that James' face matches Andy's voice and vice versa.

00:09:22.820 --> 00:09:25.620
 I think that Andy's name matches Dan's face better

00:09:25.620 --> 00:09:28.660
 and Dan's name matches Andy's face better.

00:09:28.660 --> 00:09:30.780
 I'm not really sure why, I just think it's the vibes,

00:09:30.780 --> 00:09:33.120
 you know, hugs and kisses Duncan.

00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:35.620
 - Is that spicy?

00:09:35.620 --> 00:09:38.260
 - I don't think it's, I'm afraid, like it's meat.

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:41.360
 It's unquestionably meat, but I don't think it's spicy enough.

00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:43.320
 But it's not bad meat.

00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:44.600
 But I wouldn't send it back in a restaurant,

00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:47.600
 which I do with anything above a lemon and herb, I'm afraid.

00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:49.600
 I've gleefully enjoyed that lemon and herb email from you,

00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:51.040
 so thank you. - Yeah, nice.

00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:53.520
 - All right, here's another one, it's from Gary Greenberg.

00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:54.360
 Lovely name.

00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:57.400
 High quotes, no such thing as a fish podcasters.

00:09:57.400 --> 00:09:59.120
 We know who's being addressed.

00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:00.680
 I'm a little behind on my podcasts,

00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:02.480
 so I just heard the one where you talked about people

00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:04.280
 who can get goosebumps at will.

00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:05.640
 - That wasn't too long ago.

00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:07.800
 - I happen to be one of those people.

00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:08.640
 - Ooh.

00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:11.180
 - I now know just how rare it is

00:10:11.180 --> 00:10:14.580
 to build on a couple of things said in the podcast.

00:10:14.580 --> 00:10:17.820
 One, I have actually described this as a useless superpower,

00:10:17.820 --> 00:10:20.420
 so that description was spot on in my opinion.

00:10:20.420 --> 00:10:23.360
 Two, no, I can't make my nipples arrest at will.

00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:25.580
 (laughing)

00:10:25.580 --> 00:10:27.540
 - That's what we all wanted to know.

00:10:27.540 --> 00:10:29.580
 'Cause it's just like one giant goose bump.

00:10:29.580 --> 00:10:30.420
 - Who follows up?

00:10:30.420 --> 00:10:32.300
 If you'd like, I can try to take a video of it.

00:10:32.300 --> 00:10:34.420
 Brackets, the goose bumps, not my nipples.

00:10:34.420 --> 00:10:35.980
 - Oh, yeah, I'd be keen.

00:10:35.980 --> 00:10:37.600
 I'm, unless there are nipples, I'm not interested.

00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:38.960
 I'm afraid Gary.

00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:40.320
 - Fair enough.

00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:43.400
 - What if he really zoomed in on a goose bump?

00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:44.380
 - Yeah, that'll do.

00:10:44.380 --> 00:10:45.220
 Yeah.

00:10:45.220 --> 00:10:46.560
 (laughing)

00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:51.560
 - If you were making a model railway,

00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:52.560
 - Go on.

00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:53.920
 - You could use your goose bumps

00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:56.100
 as tiny nipples for the characters.

00:10:56.100 --> 00:10:58.360
 (laughing)

00:10:58.360 --> 00:11:02.040
 - Well, that is an interesting offer.

00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:03.880
 That's quite spicy.

00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:04.960
 - I got sent a complaint,

00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:07.460
 which should be, it should go, you know,

00:11:07.460 --> 00:11:08.300
 it should go to you really.

00:11:08.300 --> 00:11:09.140
 - Oh, goose bump.

00:11:09.140 --> 00:11:09.980
 (laughing)

00:11:09.980 --> 00:11:11.000
 - Okay.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.540
 No, no, this is just, I got sent this on DM a while ago.

00:11:14.540 --> 00:11:17.440
 So I'm sorry it's taking so long to bring it to the table.

00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:19.780
 It's from, I think someone called Ringo Bryan.

00:11:19.780 --> 00:11:20.980
 I might have added Ringo.

00:11:20.980 --> 00:11:22.840
 So let's call it, 'cause he signs off as B.

00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:23.900
 So maybe it's Bryan.

00:11:23.900 --> 00:11:24.740
 - Okay.

00:11:24.740 --> 00:11:25.580
 - All right.

00:11:25.580 --> 00:11:26.420
 Hello, Dan.

00:11:26.420 --> 00:11:28.020
 Long time listener, first time writer,

00:11:28.020 --> 00:11:29.380
 huge fan of the show.

00:11:29.380 --> 00:11:31.860
 Can express my dismay at the most recent episode

00:11:31.860 --> 00:11:34.260
 with Lucy Porter, so it's a while ago.

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:36.320
 In which you and Lucy go on to spoil

00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:38.720
 one flu over the Cuckoo's Nest.

00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:40.520
 As you were talking, it sounded great.

00:11:40.520 --> 00:11:43.000
 And I paused the episode and I went and bought the book.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:44.080
 - Oh no.

00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:45.960
 - You can then imagine my horror

00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:49.360
 when not 45 seconds later, you go on to spoil it.

00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:51.880
 Oh, it's all to everyone is likely to know the story.

00:11:51.880 --> 00:11:54.480
 He puts in quotes, but not only spoil it,

00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:58.160
 but go on to explain the subtleties in the chief's actions

00:11:58.160 --> 00:12:00.040
 in that it was a mercy killing.

00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:01.760
 Any other books you wanna ruin?

00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:03.240
 Currently reading remains of the day.

00:12:03.240 --> 00:12:04.740
 You wanna take a swipe?

00:12:04.740 --> 00:12:06.000
 I love a crack.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:07.120
 All my love.

00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:09.780
 B, just to let you know, mate,

00:12:09.780 --> 00:12:11.580
 that at the end of the remains of the day,

00:12:11.580 --> 00:12:15.140
 Stevens the Butler realizes his life has been a hollow sham.

00:12:15.140 --> 00:12:16.580
 And he sits on a bench.

00:12:16.580 --> 00:12:17.420
 - Does he?

00:12:17.420 --> 00:12:18.260
 - That's it.

00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:22.720
 Yeah, it's a, but it doesn't matter

00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:24.940
 'cause the journey to get there is an incredible book

00:12:24.940 --> 00:12:26.100
 and you should read it anyway.

00:12:26.100 --> 00:12:28.300
 - Do you think there is something in this

00:12:28.300 --> 00:12:30.780
 of like a chat line, perhaps,

00:12:30.780 --> 00:12:32.940
 where people want to hear spoilers

00:12:32.940 --> 00:12:35.400
 and you employ someone who's read myriad books

00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:36.560
 like you have Andy.

00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:38.200
 So you just sit by your phone

00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:39.300
 and someone just goes,

00:12:39.300 --> 00:12:42.060
 "Dring, ring, ring, ring, 39 steps."

00:12:42.060 --> 00:12:46.360
 - Oh, it's a memory system set by a guy.

00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:47.200
 Yeah, yeah, that's good.

00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:48.040
 I like it.

00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:49.600
 Oh, hello.

00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:51.040
 Yes, they each think the other one's died.

00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:52.200
 It's a poison thing.

00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:53.040
 Yeah, yeah.

00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:54.600
 And then, funnily enough, they both die.

00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:55.440
 - Brilliant.

00:12:55.440 --> 00:12:56.280
 - Bye.

00:12:56.280 --> 00:12:58.960
 Is it for sadists or is it for cramming GCSE students

00:12:58.960 --> 00:12:59.800
 or is it for--

00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:00.880
 - Sometimes you come up with the idea

00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:02.280
 and you don't know what the market is

00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:03.620
 and the market just arrives.

00:13:03.620 --> 00:13:05.540
 - Yeah, if you build it, they will come.

00:13:05.540 --> 00:13:06.380
 - Yeah.

00:13:06.380 --> 00:13:07.220
 - It feels like a grave.

00:13:07.220 --> 00:13:08.660
 - Is that a spoiler about--

00:13:08.660 --> 00:13:09.500
 - Field of Dreams?

00:13:09.500 --> 00:13:10.340
 - Field of Dreams.

00:13:10.340 --> 00:13:11.180
 (laughing)

00:13:11.180 --> 00:13:12.180
 - Spongebob, they do build it.

00:13:12.180 --> 00:13:13.020
 - They came.

00:13:13.020 --> 00:13:15.500
 (laughing)

00:13:15.500 --> 00:13:16.540
 - Oh, that's great.

00:13:16.540 --> 00:13:19.580
 Here's an email from Molly Blue Dawn.

00:13:19.580 --> 00:13:23.500
 The mention of gold beater's skin in episode 476

00:13:23.500 --> 00:13:27.780
 reminded me that in Japan, instead of cow intestines,

00:13:27.780 --> 00:13:29.820
 what is it, they used to beat gold very, very thin

00:13:29.820 --> 00:13:31.700
 by putting it in between layers of cow intestines.

00:13:31.700 --> 00:13:33.360
 - That's right, yeah.

00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:34.800
 - In Japan, instead of cow intestines,

00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:37.260
 gold beater's used tanuki scrota.

00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:41.140
 - Pardon, who was tanuki?

00:13:41.140 --> 00:13:42.860
 (laughing)

00:13:42.860 --> 00:13:46.100
 - A tanuki is another name for a raccoon dog.

00:13:46.100 --> 00:13:48.540
 - Oh, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, I know them, yeah, yeah.

00:13:48.540 --> 00:13:49.460
 - Animal they have.

00:13:49.460 --> 00:13:51.840
 But there's a big thing in Japan of tanuki

00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:53.920
 with massive nutsacks.

00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:54.760
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:13:54.760 --> 00:13:58.260
 - And supposedly it's because the gold beater's

00:13:58.260 --> 00:14:01.020
 were using the scrotums to wallop

00:14:01.020 --> 00:14:03.700
 the gold leaf very, very, very thin.

00:14:03.700 --> 00:14:07.340
 And she sent a source and it looked pretty reputable.

00:14:07.340 --> 00:14:09.100
 So there we go.

00:14:09.100 --> 00:14:09.940
 - That's really good.

00:14:09.940 --> 00:14:10.840
 - Yeah, nice.

00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:11.980
 Thank you very much, Molly.

00:14:11.980 --> 00:14:13.380
 - I got a coin, can I just chuck one more in?

00:14:13.380 --> 00:14:14.600
 Just like save these on my phone

00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:16.180
 and I realized I hadn't read them.

00:14:16.180 --> 00:14:17.580
 This is from Tim Ryan in Canada.

00:14:17.580 --> 00:14:20.060
 Just finished episode 463 with your fact

00:14:20.060 --> 00:14:21.660
 about the sluggered wakers in church.

00:14:21.660 --> 00:14:22.820
 You remember I had this fact where

00:14:22.820 --> 00:14:23.820
 if you fell asleep in church,

00:14:23.820 --> 00:14:25.540
 someone went around poking you to make sure

00:14:25.540 --> 00:14:28.240
 you'd come to and be awake for the service.

00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:30.580
 - They kept poking you to make sure you'd come.

00:14:30.580 --> 00:14:32.740
 - Yeah, so, too.

00:14:32.740 --> 00:14:34.700
 These people, says Tim,

00:14:34.700 --> 00:14:36.540
 these people are alive and well

00:14:36.540 --> 00:14:38.900
 and thriving in rural Ghana.

00:14:38.900 --> 00:14:40.780
 I went to two churches while there

00:14:40.780 --> 00:14:42.820
 and both had women patrolling the side aisles

00:14:42.820 --> 00:14:45.740
 with six foot poles that they would poke,

00:14:45.740 --> 00:14:47.820
 not so gently between people's shoulders

00:14:47.820 --> 00:14:49.100
 if they're not at all.

00:14:49.100 --> 00:14:50.420
 - Yeah, that's really good.

00:14:50.420 --> 00:14:51.260
 - Pretty cool.

00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:52.100
 - That's good.

00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:52.940
 - That's awesome.

00:14:52.940 --> 00:14:56.140
 - Here's a query for more information from Michael.

00:14:56.140 --> 00:14:58.140
 Michael writes, "Sorry to hound you."

00:14:58.140 --> 00:15:00.940
 This is actually a clever joke with so many emails.

00:15:00.940 --> 00:15:02.660
 I was just listening to the British Library episode

00:15:02.660 --> 00:15:04.900
 with Sally Phillips and found myself wanting to know more

00:15:04.900 --> 00:15:06.940
 about your hound, pooch, or mutt game.

00:15:06.940 --> 00:15:09.220
 It was glossed over in the episode.

00:15:09.220 --> 00:15:10.660
 - There was a reason we glossed over this.

00:15:10.660 --> 00:15:11.500
 - I don't remember this.

00:15:11.500 --> 00:15:13.380
 - I'm sure I'm the only listener.

00:15:13.380 --> 00:15:15.680
 He says I'm sure I'm the only listener.

00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:18.500
 I think he must mean I'm sure I'm not the only listener.

00:15:18.500 --> 00:15:20.340
 Desperate to hear which doggy traits

00:15:20.340 --> 00:15:21.620
 belong to which category.

00:15:21.620 --> 00:15:23.540
 - So Andy has this game that he plays

00:15:23.540 --> 00:15:26.660
 whenever he sees a canine.

00:15:26.660 --> 00:15:30.900
 They are either a mutt, a pooch, or a hound.

00:15:30.900 --> 00:15:31.740
 - Okay.

00:15:31.740 --> 00:15:33.620
 - And apparently, if you're Andy,

00:15:33.620 --> 00:15:35.620
 you can automatically tell which is which.

00:15:35.620 --> 00:15:37.100
 - Well, it takes, it's taken time,

00:15:37.100 --> 00:15:39.340
 but I'm now very, very quick.

00:15:39.340 --> 00:15:41.380
 - And the person who decides whether or not

00:15:41.380 --> 00:15:43.160
 you're right is you.

00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:44.000
 - Yeah.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:44.840
 - Yeah.

00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:45.680
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:15:45.680 --> 00:15:46.780
 - Normally you play it with someone else.

00:15:46.780 --> 00:15:48.780
 It's not really a one player game.

00:15:48.780 --> 00:15:53.060
 It can be, at a pinch, in a tight spot.

00:15:53.060 --> 00:15:55.020
 - I can't picture the difference between the three.

00:15:55.020 --> 00:15:56.820
 - Think of it, think of a classic pooch.

00:15:56.820 --> 00:15:58.180
 You know, I'm thinking a shih tzu.

00:15:58.180 --> 00:15:59.420
 I'm thinking something that's small

00:15:59.420 --> 00:16:01.300
 and fluffy and defenseless, you know?

00:16:01.300 --> 00:16:02.820
 There are some dogs which are clearly poochers.

00:16:02.820 --> 00:16:04.300
 And you can have very large poochers as well,

00:16:04.300 --> 00:16:05.460
 but normally they're a bit smaller.

00:16:05.460 --> 00:16:06.820
 Hounds, you know what a hound is?

00:16:06.820 --> 00:16:09.540
 It's like, it's an Irish wolf hound,

00:16:09.540 --> 00:16:11.700
 or it's like, they're big, they're long legs,

00:16:11.700 --> 00:16:14.620
 they're rangy, they're terrifying.

00:16:14.620 --> 00:16:17.780
 Then you've got a mutt, which is a bit of a catchall.

00:16:17.780 --> 00:16:22.100
 - Okay, let me ask some questions

00:16:22.100 --> 00:16:25.820
 due to what I see day to day.

00:16:25.820 --> 00:16:29.580
 What is Harry McClary from Donaldson's Dairy?

00:16:29.580 --> 00:16:31.140
 - That's a children's book character, isn't it?

00:16:31.140 --> 00:16:32.740
 I think Harry McClary is a mutt.

00:16:32.740 --> 00:16:33.580
 - He's a mutt.

00:16:33.580 --> 00:16:34.820
 - A bit of everything, you know?

00:16:34.820 --> 00:16:37.260
 - Hercules Mars as big as a horse.

00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:39.740
 - My knowledge of the universe, I'm afraid, is not,

00:16:39.740 --> 00:16:42.220
 I mean, if he's as big as a horse, he sounds like a hound.

00:16:42.220 --> 00:16:43.140
 - Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:16:43.140 --> 00:16:44.620
 - Yeah, he's pretty handy, yeah.

00:16:44.620 --> 00:16:47.100
 But it's on a dog-by-dog basis, you know?

00:16:47.100 --> 00:16:50.260
 - Can you have two dogs from the same breed,

00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:51.420
 one of which is a hound

00:16:51.420 --> 00:16:53.060
 and one of which is a mutt's horror?

00:16:53.060 --> 00:16:54.580
 - I don't know if you could have two Daxons,

00:16:54.580 --> 00:16:56.980
 one of which is a pooch.

00:16:56.980 --> 00:16:57.820
 I think they're quite pooch.

00:16:57.820 --> 00:16:59.660
 Oh, no, they're quite hound-y, actually.

00:16:59.660 --> 00:17:00.660
 - Well, that's hound.

00:17:00.660 --> 00:17:03.020
 - Yeah, and they used to be hunting dogs, so yeah.

00:17:03.020 --> 00:17:04.820
 And you can have, like, it's star signs, you know,

00:17:04.820 --> 00:17:07.580
 it's like, it's hound with a bit of pooch.

00:17:07.580 --> 00:17:08.420
 - Okay.

00:17:08.420 --> 00:17:09.900
 - You know, anyway, it's a really fun game.

00:17:09.900 --> 00:17:11.180
 - Oh, yeah, it sounds great.

00:17:11.180 --> 00:17:14.020
 - No, I'm trying to get my head around it

00:17:14.020 --> 00:17:15.540
 'cause I'm thinking, like, a pit bull, what's a pit bull?

00:17:15.540 --> 00:17:16.540
 What's a sausage dog?

00:17:16.540 --> 00:17:17.380
 What, like, these dogs-

00:17:17.380 --> 00:17:20.020
 - Well, there's a hound. - What's a sausage dog, then?

00:17:20.020 --> 00:17:21.140
 - Well, I think it's a bit of a,

00:17:21.140 --> 00:17:22.140
 I think that's also a hound

00:17:22.140 --> 00:17:24.060
 'cause they can be quite vicious, and you know.

00:17:24.060 --> 00:17:25.940
 - Okay, so hound is a trait of viciousness, isn't it?

00:17:25.940 --> 00:17:28.020
 - There's also just dog, which is a Labrador,

00:17:28.020 --> 00:17:29.220
 which is a classic dog.

00:17:29.220 --> 00:17:30.060
 - That's dog?

00:17:30.060 --> 00:17:32.020
 - Yeah, Labrador and Retrieve are both just dogs.

00:17:32.020 --> 00:17:34.500
 - Okay, right, right, wow, great game.

00:17:34.500 --> 00:17:37.660
 - I think maybe keep it to one player.

00:17:37.660 --> 00:17:39.380
 (laughing)

00:17:39.380 --> 00:17:40.220
 - Let's move on.

00:17:40.220 --> 00:17:43.780
 Let's move on to an email from anonymous teacher Jenny.

00:17:43.780 --> 00:17:44.620
 - Okay.

00:17:44.620 --> 00:17:45.660
 - Not very anonymous.

00:17:45.660 --> 00:17:47.140
 - Half anonymous, crucially.

00:17:47.140 --> 00:17:50.100
 Hello, no such thing as a fish team.

00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:52.620
 I am a high school history teacher from Pennsylvania.

00:17:52.620 --> 00:17:54.620
 I have checked with Jenny what I'm allowed to say about her,

00:17:54.620 --> 00:17:56.500
 and already I feel like it's quite narrowed.

00:17:56.500 --> 00:17:58.380
 Every Friday morning, I listen to your podcast

00:17:58.380 --> 00:18:00.420
 during my drive to school, and I also get to my classroom.

00:18:00.420 --> 00:18:02.820
 - So she lives not within walking distance

00:18:02.820 --> 00:18:04.180
 of her school in Pennsylvania?

00:18:04.180 --> 00:18:05.020
 - Oh, dear.

00:18:05.020 --> 00:18:07.100
 (laughing)

00:18:07.100 --> 00:18:09.380
 Yeah, I get to my classroom ready for the day.

00:18:09.380 --> 00:18:11.380
 I suppose I've brought it up enough with my first class

00:18:11.380 --> 00:18:13.100
 that some of my students have taken to asking,

00:18:13.100 --> 00:18:16.940
 so what facts did you learn this morning, Ms. Cernay,

00:18:16.940 --> 00:18:18.660
 and I haven't redacted that.

00:18:18.660 --> 00:18:20.620
 I'm very excited that today I will get to tell them

00:18:20.620 --> 00:18:22.460
 about tiny bits of coal.

00:18:22.460 --> 00:18:23.300
 (laughing)

00:18:23.300 --> 00:18:24.620
 - Oh, no.

00:18:24.620 --> 00:18:27.580
 - 'Cause we covered what model row is used for coal,

00:18:27.580 --> 00:18:29.060
 which is small lumps of coal.

00:18:29.060 --> 00:18:30.220
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:18:30.220 --> 00:18:33.100
 Hence my chill earlier about nipples.

00:18:33.100 --> 00:18:34.380
 - Yeah, exactly, yeah, yeah.

00:18:34.380 --> 00:18:36.540
 What I won't tell them, Jenny continues,

00:18:36.540 --> 00:18:37.900
 is that I was laughing so hard

00:18:37.900 --> 00:18:39.500
 at how ridiculous that whole bit was,

00:18:39.500 --> 00:18:42.300
 I nearly ran one of them, my pupils, over.

00:18:42.300 --> 00:18:43.700
 (laughing)

00:18:43.700 --> 00:18:46.340
 While pulling into the parking lot.

00:18:46.340 --> 00:18:47.660
 Fortunately, everyone was fine,

00:18:47.660 --> 00:18:50.660
 and it was only me who even seemed to notice, but still.

00:18:50.660 --> 00:18:55.220
 She says, imagine if I would've had to explain to the police

00:18:55.220 --> 00:18:57.420
 about just how funny it was that model train builders

00:18:57.420 --> 00:19:00.020
 use tiny pieces of coal to represent coal on their models,

00:19:00.020 --> 00:19:01.860
 and that's why it was momentarily

00:19:01.860 --> 00:19:03.740
 and justifiably incapacitated.

00:19:03.740 --> 00:19:06.100
 - It feels like she'd get off, don't you think?

00:19:06.100 --> 00:19:07.100
 - I think so.

00:19:07.100 --> 00:19:08.700
 I think no jury would convict.

00:19:08.700 --> 00:19:09.540
 - Yeah.

00:19:09.540 --> 00:19:10.540
 - So thank you, Jenny.

00:19:10.540 --> 00:19:12.460
 (laughing)

00:19:12.460 --> 00:19:13.700
 - We have had a few of those, did we help you?

00:19:13.700 --> 00:19:14.700
 - I was just thinking that.

00:19:14.700 --> 00:19:18.300
 We once sent a photo of an actual car crash,

00:19:18.300 --> 00:19:19.740
 someone went off the side of the road,

00:19:19.740 --> 00:19:21.780
 'cause they were laughing so hard, apparently.

00:19:21.780 --> 00:19:23.220
 She sent us, yeah, she sent us photos.

00:19:23.220 --> 00:19:24.820
 It was like a quite mangled car.

00:19:24.820 --> 00:19:26.660
 This was in our first year, I think.

00:19:26.660 --> 00:19:28.180
 - Oh, well, that was very funny.

00:19:28.180 --> 00:19:29.020
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:19:29.020 --> 00:19:30.180
 - That was tired.

00:19:30.180 --> 00:19:33.020
 - It burnt out.

00:19:33.020 --> 00:19:33.860
 - It's a great stuff, there.

00:19:33.860 --> 00:19:35.060
 - It's the Garfield Anus here, yeah.

00:19:35.060 --> 00:19:36.140
 - Yeah.

00:19:36.140 --> 00:19:38.820
 - Oh, well, thanks for writing in, Jenny.

00:19:38.820 --> 00:19:39.660
 - Thank you, yeah, yeah.

00:19:39.660 --> 00:19:42.300
 And there's just one wrong Colgate.

00:19:42.300 --> 00:19:43.140
 There's another one from Jules.

00:19:43.140 --> 00:19:44.180
 - Colgate?

00:19:44.180 --> 00:19:45.020
 - Sorry.

00:19:45.020 --> 00:19:45.860
 (laughing)

00:19:45.860 --> 00:19:47.180
 Colgate.

00:19:47.180 --> 00:19:48.860
 - Gate, yeah.

00:19:48.860 --> 00:19:49.700
 Jules writes in saying,

00:19:49.700 --> 00:19:51.700
 I suspect others may have mentioned this.

00:19:51.700 --> 00:19:52.540
 You're wrong, Jules.

00:19:52.540 --> 00:19:53.380
 You're wrong, wrong, wrong.

00:19:53.380 --> 00:19:54.660
 A lot of people write in saying,

00:19:54.660 --> 00:19:56.260
 I think a lot of other people must have mentioned this.

00:19:56.260 --> 00:19:58.820
 Almost invariably they're the only person who's noticed it.

00:19:58.820 --> 00:19:59.820
 I don't know what's going on there.

00:19:59.820 --> 00:20:00.940
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:20:00.940 --> 00:20:01.780
 - Anyway.

00:20:01.780 --> 00:20:02.620
 - Spam filters.

00:20:02.620 --> 00:20:03.860
 (laughing)

00:20:03.860 --> 00:20:06.060
 - In episode 479, Andy got very excited

00:20:06.060 --> 00:20:07.660
 in the lead up to a motor railway fact.

00:20:07.660 --> 00:20:09.220
 I was on the edge of my seat,

00:20:09.220 --> 00:20:11.300
 brackets metaphorically as I was walking.

00:20:11.300 --> 00:20:13.540
 (laughing)

00:20:13.540 --> 00:20:18.740
 Because I knew a related MOS fact.

00:20:18.740 --> 00:20:20.540
 Could it be possible that I might have known something

00:20:20.540 --> 00:20:22.740
 before hearing it on the podcast?

00:20:22.740 --> 00:20:24.060
 - I bet it's not.

00:20:24.060 --> 00:20:25.420
 - Alas, no.

00:20:25.420 --> 00:20:28.380
 The slight groans, very generous to call them slight,

00:20:28.380 --> 00:20:31.620
 at coal being used to model coal were echoed by myself

00:20:31.620 --> 00:20:34.940
 as I realized Andy had a swing and a miss

00:20:34.940 --> 00:20:37.340
 when he could have told everyone

00:20:37.340 --> 00:20:39.180
 that model railway makers often use MOS

00:20:39.180 --> 00:20:40.980
 to recreate bushes and trees.

00:20:40.980 --> 00:20:41.820
 - That's so funny.

00:20:41.820 --> 00:20:42.660
 - On the railways.

00:20:42.660 --> 00:20:44.460
 Now, I'm afraid, Jules, I think I have mentioned that

00:20:44.460 --> 00:20:46.220
 on the whole episode of the podcast.

00:20:46.220 --> 00:20:48.620
 - I'm not sure if it hasn't been on the podcast for sure.

00:20:48.620 --> 00:20:52.460
 'Cause I remember our producer of QI, P.S. Fletcher,

00:20:52.460 --> 00:20:56.140
 used to make fun of you all the time.

00:20:56.140 --> 00:20:57.780
 But apparently you once mentioned

00:20:57.780 --> 00:21:00.020
 that MOS can be used on model railways

00:21:00.020 --> 00:21:02.100
 and almost every meeting he used to say,

00:21:02.100 --> 00:21:04.580
 "Oh, Andy with his MOS on his model railways."

00:21:04.580 --> 00:21:05.580
 - That's absolutely right.

00:21:05.580 --> 00:21:06.780
 - It became quite a thing, didn't it,

00:21:06.780 --> 00:21:07.600
 for about a year.

00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:09.180
 - It did, but that was also during the year

00:21:09.180 --> 00:21:11.100
 when we were teasing him because it turns out

00:21:11.100 --> 00:21:13.260
 he keeps all his old checkbook stubs.

00:21:13.260 --> 00:21:15.340
 (laughing)

00:21:15.340 --> 00:21:17.600
 So it really became a bit of a back and forth

00:21:17.600 --> 00:21:19.020
 war of attrition there.

00:21:19.020 --> 00:21:19.860
 - Yeah.

00:21:19.860 --> 00:21:20.700
 - Yeah.

00:21:20.700 --> 00:21:21.860
 - That's amazing.

00:21:21.860 --> 00:21:24.260
 - If I look in our archive for the word MOS,

00:21:24.260 --> 00:21:25.740
 I'm gonna get absolutely nowhere.

00:21:25.740 --> 00:21:26.940
 (laughing)

00:21:26.940 --> 00:21:28.700
 Jules, I'm afraid I've got no way of proving it

00:21:28.700 --> 00:21:31.460
 if it hasn't been on the podcast, but I did know it.

00:21:31.460 --> 00:21:32.940
 - I think, you know, sometimes when you bring a topic

00:21:32.940 --> 00:21:35.020
 to the table with fish and we do our recordings

00:21:35.020 --> 00:21:36.940
 and then we gotta move on 'cause time's running out.

00:21:36.940 --> 00:21:37.780
 - Yeah.

00:21:37.780 --> 00:21:39.060
 - I wish I just had a bit more time to chat.

00:21:39.060 --> 00:21:40.300
 I sort of feel like Drop Us Align

00:21:40.300 --> 00:21:42.060
 is slightly turning into Andy's chats

00:21:42.060 --> 00:21:45.340
 to just really get back into the meat of a subject

00:21:45.340 --> 00:21:46.980
 that we said goodbye to.

00:21:46.980 --> 00:21:50.140
 - I think it's more like he listens to the final edit

00:21:50.140 --> 00:21:52.100
 and he's like, "I can't believe he cut that out."

00:21:52.100 --> 00:21:54.300
 (laughing)

00:21:54.300 --> 00:21:56.020
 - Well, the last time we talked about model trains,

00:21:56.020 --> 00:21:57.580
 I actually don't think,

00:21:57.580 --> 00:21:59.820
 I don't think it was mentioned, the MOS thing.

00:21:59.820 --> 00:22:01.940
 So actually Jules, that's a perfectly reasonable email

00:22:01.940 --> 00:22:05.500
 to send, even if fundamentally baseless.

00:22:05.500 --> 00:22:06.940
 I used to have it when I was young

00:22:06.940 --> 00:22:09.340
 and I did have model, was making models.

00:22:09.340 --> 00:22:11.380
 - Well, that's the thing about bullying in the workplace.

00:22:11.380 --> 00:22:13.980
 It's often based on a nub of truth.

00:22:13.980 --> 00:22:14.820
 - Yeah.

00:22:14.820 --> 00:22:16.020
 - And that's why it's often fine.

00:22:16.020 --> 00:22:17.580
 (laughing)

00:22:17.580 --> 00:22:19.660
 - Not defendable in court.

00:22:19.660 --> 00:22:22.420
 - But she was saying that she had, she was like,

00:22:22.420 --> 00:22:23.260
 oh, I can't believe.

00:22:23.260 --> 00:22:24.100
 - Yeah, Jules.

00:22:24.100 --> 00:22:24.940
 - I don't know, Jules.

00:22:24.940 --> 00:22:25.780
 - Oh, could be Jules.

00:22:25.780 --> 00:22:26.620
 - Yeah.

00:22:26.620 --> 00:22:27.440
 - Jules Holland.

00:22:27.440 --> 00:22:28.260
 - Yeah.

00:22:28.260 --> 00:22:29.100
 - Jules.

00:22:29.100 --> 00:22:29.940
 - Could be Jules.

00:22:29.940 --> 00:22:30.860
 A famous model railway.

00:22:30.860 --> 00:22:31.700
 - Yeah.

00:22:31.700 --> 00:22:33.180
 - An aficionado, Jules Holland.

00:22:33.180 --> 00:22:34.020
 - Oh, well, there we go.

00:22:34.020 --> 00:22:35.180
 This is exciting.

00:22:35.180 --> 00:22:36.700
 - Did you know that, Dan?

00:22:36.700 --> 00:22:38.140
 - Is that one of the facts I got cut from?

00:22:38.140 --> 00:22:39.300
 - Jules Holland, yeah, well.

00:22:39.300 --> 00:22:40.500
 (laughing)

00:22:40.500 --> 00:22:41.540
 I think I might have pre-cut it

00:22:41.540 --> 00:22:42.380
 and just not said it on the way.

00:22:42.380 --> 00:22:43.220
 - Right, right.

00:22:43.220 --> 00:22:44.380
 - But Jules Holland has a huge model railway.

00:22:44.380 --> 00:22:45.220
 - Does he?

00:22:45.220 --> 00:22:46.040
 No, I didn't know that.

00:22:46.040 --> 00:22:46.880
 - Yeah.

00:22:46.880 --> 00:22:47.720
 - Jules' annual hootenanny

00:22:47.720 --> 00:22:49.820
 is actually built inside his model railway track.

00:22:49.820 --> 00:22:50.660
 (laughing)

00:22:50.660 --> 00:22:51.500
 It's sad.

00:22:51.500 --> 00:22:52.340
 It's very impressive.

00:22:52.340 --> 00:22:53.180
 Sorry, what were you gonna say, Jules?

00:22:53.180 --> 00:22:55.300
 - Was Jules saying that they were astonished

00:22:55.300 --> 00:22:57.260
 that they knew something about MOS

00:22:57.260 --> 00:22:59.020
 without having learned it on our show?

00:22:59.020 --> 00:23:00.620
 - 'Cause if that's the case, then yes, that's--

00:23:00.620 --> 00:23:03.540
 - No, in fact, before me and--

00:23:03.540 --> 00:23:05.700
 - Oh, okay, all right, no, no, then that's fine, yeah.

00:23:05.700 --> 00:23:07.220
 - Yeah, so anyway,

00:23:07.220 --> 00:23:08.960
 I think it still counts as a swing and a miss.

00:23:08.960 --> 00:23:09.800
 - Yeah.

00:23:09.800 --> 00:23:11.620
 - And I'll take that on the chin.

00:23:11.620 --> 00:23:14.380
 - I actually, when you started saying that fact

00:23:14.380 --> 00:23:15.700
 about the coal,

00:23:15.700 --> 00:23:18.420
 I genuinely thought you were gonna say about MOS.

00:23:18.420 --> 00:23:19.700
 Because you remember, you said,

00:23:19.700 --> 00:23:21.500
 I've got a fact about model railways

00:23:21.500 --> 00:23:23.300
 and Dan realized what you were gonna say

00:23:23.300 --> 00:23:25.700
 because you told us there was this boring fact.

00:23:25.700 --> 00:23:26.540
 - Yeah.

00:23:26.540 --> 00:23:27.580
 - And I knew it was gonna be a boring fact

00:23:27.580 --> 00:23:29.220
 and I was sure it was gonna be the MOS.

00:23:29.220 --> 00:23:30.500
 - The MOS thing, yeah, yeah.

00:23:30.500 --> 00:23:33.700
 I really threw you for a loop there, yeah.

00:23:33.700 --> 00:23:34.700
 All right, here's one more.

00:23:34.700 --> 00:23:36.740
 This is a really nice one, this is from Lily.

00:23:36.740 --> 00:23:41.100
 Hello, Andy, Andrew, James, and Anna.

00:23:41.100 --> 00:23:41.940
 Sorry, Dan.

00:23:41.940 --> 00:23:43.780
 - Say that again.

00:23:43.780 --> 00:23:47.700
 - Hello, Andy, Andrew, James, and Anna.

00:23:47.700 --> 00:23:49.220
 - Two hello's for you.

00:23:49.220 --> 00:23:51.420
 - Yes, that's the point, that is why I read that.

00:23:51.420 --> 00:23:52.500
 (laughing)

00:23:52.500 --> 00:23:54.620
 - Do you wanna hear a fact about Andes?

00:23:54.620 --> 00:23:56.820
 - Oh yeah, go on, yeah.

00:23:56.820 --> 00:23:59.900
 - For the last podcast, which was about puffins,

00:23:59.900 --> 00:24:01.980
 which will have gone out by the time this goes out,

00:24:01.980 --> 00:24:04.780
 I found in the OED that there was an old English word

00:24:04.780 --> 00:24:07.900
 for a puffin, which was a cock Andy.

00:24:07.900 --> 00:24:08.740
 - A cock Andy.

00:24:08.740 --> 00:24:09.580
 - Cock Andy.

00:24:09.580 --> 00:24:10.420
 - Cock Andy.

00:24:10.420 --> 00:24:11.500
 - There's another new nickname.

00:24:11.500 --> 00:24:12.740
 - Cock Andy is quite.

00:24:12.740 --> 00:24:13.860
 - Yeah, it's cute.

00:24:13.860 --> 00:24:14.700
 Puffins are cute.

00:24:14.700 --> 00:24:15.780
 - They are cute.

00:24:15.780 --> 00:24:16.620
 - Anyway, sorry.

00:24:16.620 --> 00:24:17.700
 - No, no, no, no.

00:24:17.700 --> 00:24:21.140
 Anyway, Lily writes hello to me twice

00:24:21.140 --> 00:24:22.860
 so the rest of you can get stuffed.

00:24:22.860 --> 00:24:26.180
 I'm a huge fan of yours.

00:24:26.180 --> 00:24:27.260
 - Well, all four of us.

00:24:27.260 --> 00:24:28.100
 - All four of us.

00:24:28.100 --> 00:24:29.780
 (laughing)

00:24:29.780 --> 00:24:33.020
 - I found out strong Victorian ladies used to be a thing

00:24:33.020 --> 00:24:35.500
 and can't recall an episode in which you discuss them.

00:24:35.500 --> 00:24:37.060
 Apologies if you have.

00:24:37.060 --> 00:24:39.140
 I think we might've fleetingly mentioned them.

00:24:39.140 --> 00:24:40.780
 I think it was 'cause we did them on the TV show,

00:24:40.780 --> 00:24:43.140
 we never really got fully into them and that thing.

00:24:43.140 --> 00:24:46.180
 Anyway, she just mentions a fact, which I love,

00:24:46.180 --> 00:24:49.300
 which is very related to fish as well, which is great.

00:24:49.300 --> 00:24:53.460
 Get this, in 1901, Valkana, the strong woman,

00:24:53.460 --> 00:24:57.740
 freed a wagon stuck in Maiden Lane Covent Garden

00:24:57.740 --> 00:25:02.260
 by lifting it in front of astonished witnesses.

00:25:02.260 --> 00:25:03.180
 - Wow.

00:25:03.180 --> 00:25:04.500
 - And she links to an article

00:25:04.500 --> 00:25:06.660
 all about the Victorian strong women.

00:25:06.660 --> 00:25:07.660
 - That's great.

00:25:07.660 --> 00:25:10.060
 We actually mentioned Sundwina, I think, didn't we?

00:25:10.060 --> 00:25:11.980
 - We did briefly, yeah, yeah.

00:25:11.980 --> 00:25:14.940
 But for the reference, our office used to be on Maiden Lane.

00:25:14.940 --> 00:25:16.540
 And do you know the other weird thing?

00:25:16.540 --> 00:25:18.140
 They pedestrianized it during COVID.

00:25:18.140 --> 00:25:20.740
 That's not the weird thing, shut up, shut up.

00:25:20.740 --> 00:25:23.380
 But they pedestrianized it by planting these huge wagons

00:25:23.380 --> 00:25:25.220
 across the beginning and end of the lane.

00:25:25.220 --> 00:25:27.740
 So a modern day Valkana would be able to--

00:25:27.740 --> 00:25:28.820
 - It's like a sword in the stone,

00:25:28.820 --> 00:25:30.980
 but it's the wagon in the cobbled street.

00:25:30.980 --> 00:25:31.820
 That's very cool.

00:25:31.820 --> 00:25:32.660
 - Yeah, exactly.

00:25:32.660 --> 00:25:33.500
 Well, thank you, Lili.

00:25:33.500 --> 00:25:35.060
 This is Dan, by the way, I'm on the show as well.

00:25:35.060 --> 00:25:37.300
 (laughing)

00:25:37.300 --> 00:25:40.620
 - Brilliant.

00:25:40.620 --> 00:25:41.460
 - Bye.

00:25:41.460 --> 00:25:44.040
 (upbeat music)

00:25:44.040 --> 00:25:47.460
 - Oh.

00:25:47.460 --> 00:25:48.300
 - You never know.

00:25:48.300 --> 00:25:49.540
 - Yeah, you never know.

00:25:49.540 --> 00:25:50.380
 - That was it.

00:25:50.380 --> 00:25:51.540
 No, no, no, that is it.

00:25:51.540 --> 00:25:52.700
 That's all of our emails.

00:25:52.700 --> 00:25:54.940
 Thank you so much for writing in, everybody.

00:25:54.940 --> 00:25:58.020
 And if you'd like to write to me, Andy, James and Anna,

00:25:58.020 --> 00:26:01.420
 any time you can do, just drop us a line.

00:26:01.420 --> 00:26:03.940
 All you have to do is write a podcast at qi.com.

00:26:03.940 --> 00:26:05.900
 We love hearing your extra information,

00:26:05.900 --> 00:26:08.500
 your challenges, your spicy meats.

00:26:08.500 --> 00:26:12.060
 So please do, please do keep sending them in.

00:26:12.060 --> 00:26:14.380
 And we'll be back with another one of these in a month or so.

00:26:14.380 --> 00:26:15.220
 All right, see you then.

00:26:15.220 --> 00:26:16.060
 Bye.

00:26:16.060 --> 00:26:18.640
 (upbeat music)

00:26:18.640 --> 00:26:21.220
 (upbeat music)

00:26:21.220 --> 00:26:23.800
 (upbeat music)

00:26:23.800 --> 00:26:26.380
 (upbeat music)
