00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:21,880
 *another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming to you from

2
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:24,680
 the QI offices in Covent Garden.

3
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:29,780
 My name is Dan Schreiber and I am sitting here with Anichezinski, Andrew Hunter Murray

4
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:34,380
 and Ann Miller and once again we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite

5
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:40,080
 facts from the last seven days and in no particular order, here we go.

6
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:42,700
 Starting with fact number one and that's my fact this week.

7
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:49,140
 My fact is that Scottish poet William McGonagall's writing was so bad, a circus hired him to

8
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:54,180
 give poetry readings under the condition that audiences could pelton with eggs as he

9
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:56,460
 read.

10
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:59,660
 He agreed to do that.

11
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:05,540
 He was paid 15 shillings per performance and he was actually slightly on hard times so

12
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:08,180
 he accepted it, probably going why I need the money.

13
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:09,180
 And the eggs maybe.

14
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:13,220
 Yeah and it wasn't just eggs, it was stale bread as well, flour, he got a lot of products

15
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:14,540
 that he could go home with.

16
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:19,740
 Unfortunately, the performances were put to an end quite early on and he was disappointed

17
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:20,740
 about that supposedly.

18
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:23,780
 Yeah, weren't they put to an end because they were too riotous.

19
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:28,780
 It was in 1893, the authorities banned them because they were getting so out of control.

20
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:31,300
 People just wildly enthusiastic about pelting him.

21
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:35,740
 He was pretty tough to get an audience though, he was quite keen to spread his poetry regardless

22
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:39,420
 of how much anyone wanted to hear it, so he was like great, they love me.

23
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:42,940
 Yeah, just a tiny bit of background for anyone who hasn't heard of William McGonagall.

24
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:44,860
 This is a Scottish poet.

25
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:51,820
 He was born in either 1825 or 1830, it's a bit disputed and he was famous, very, very famous

26
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:56,620
 for the terribleness of his poems, married out just so we know what we're dealing with.

27
00:01:56,620 --> 00:02:00,780
 So one of his most famous poems was The Tay Bridge Disaster, where a bridge collapsed and

28
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:02,300
 lots of people have been killed.

29
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:07,980
 It starts off, beautiful railway bridge of the Silvery Tay, alas, I am very sorry to say

30
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:13,620
 that 90 lives have been taken away on the last Sabbath day of 1879, which will be remembered

31
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:15,860
 for a very long time.

32
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:18,140
 That's the level of poetry we're dealing with.

33
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:22,460
 And I'm sure it comforted the bereaved family members.

34
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:27,100
 He was a temperance campaigner and hated alcohol and stuff was too total, and he blamed

35
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:30,500
 the fact that no one liked his poetry on alcohol, so he said they were all too drunk to be

36
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:31,500
 able to appreciate it.

37
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:34,620
 But it does kind of imply that you just say it was the kind of thing you got really pissed

38
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:37,500
 and then said, should we go and watch some of them again?

39
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:38,500
 Yeah.

40
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:40,500
 But the last show at the friend just 3 a.m.

41
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:41,500
 Yeah.

42
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:42,500
 Exactly.

43
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:43,500
 Yeah.

44
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:44,500
 He started a very late in life, didn't he?

45
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:47,820
 So he was about 50 give or take, because we don't know exactly when he was born.

46
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:49,740
 So he was, what was he before that?

47
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:50,740
 Was he working?

48
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:52,300
 I thought he was looming and we knew.

49
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:53,300
 Yeah.

50
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:56,060
 Didn't he think he heard a voice saying to him like, right, right, you must write?

51
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:57,940
 So he was like, well, this is what I'm going to do.

52
00:02:57,940 --> 00:03:01,300
 And then the fact of whether he was good or not, didn't really come into the equation.

53
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:02,300
 Yeah.

54
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:04,180
 And he really believed in himself as well.

55
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:10,020
 He once tried to read poetry to Queen Victoria, and he sent them a letter to the palace saying

56
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:11,340
 I would like to read.

57
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:12,340
 And they said, no, it's okay.

58
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:13,340
 Thank you very much.

59
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:14,340
 That's fine.

60
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:15,340
 So he thought, I know what I'll do.

61
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:19,940
 I'll walk all the way from Dundee to Balmoral to perform to Queen Victoria.

62
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:20,940
 He did.

63
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:23,940
 He arrived at the castle and they said genuinely, no, thank you.

64
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:25,940
 Yeah, to walk all the way back.

65
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:26,940
 Didn't get to do it.

66
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:29,180
 Got a few sentry miles or so, that he was.

67
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:30,180
 Yeah, I'm fit.

68
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:33,860
 Yeah, he introduced himself as the queen's poet when he got there.

69
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:35,660
 He was a massive fan of Queen Victoria.

70
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:39,100
 There were loads of assassination attempts on her throughout her life, none of them successful.

71
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:44,100
 And after one of them, he wrote a poem in tribute to the failed assassination attempt,

72
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:48,300
 which kicks off like this, God prospered long on noble queen and long may she reign.

73
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:51,020
 McLean, he tried to shoot her, but it was all in vain.

74
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:55,620
 For God, he turned the ball aside, McLean aimed at her head, and he felt very angry because

75
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:57,020
 he didn't shoot her dead.

76
00:03:57,020 --> 00:04:01,620
 It's quite nice, I should add.

77
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:05,220
 We were reading these on National Poetry Day here in the UK.

78
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:07,860
 Yeah, celebrating as we were recording.

79
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:12,780
 He was always being victims of hoaxes that were so sad, but also kind of okay because he

80
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:14,340
 seemed oblivious to it.

81
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:18,540
 There was the famous hoaxe when a group of students sent him a thing in the post saying

82
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:23,460
 that he'd won the Order of the Grand Knight of the Holy Order of the White Elephant, which

83
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:26,780
 was an extremely important Burmese title.

84
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:31,820
 And it was a title that was given by King Thiebor of Burma for his amazing poetry, and they

85
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:34,500
 called him William Topaz in that.

86
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:38,060
 And he, thereafter, made his name William Topaz McGonagall.

87
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:39,060
 You're kidding?

88
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:40,060
 That's not his middle name.

89
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:41,060
 Yeah, that wasn't his birth name?

90
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:42,060
 No.

91
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:44,060
 So, that was the first time ever it seemed to get mentioned.

92
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:47,460
 I hadn't read that, it was where it was invented, but that was the first time it's mentioned.

93
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:52,140
 And then he had this award up on his wall forevermore, thinking that the King of Burma had blessed

94
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:53,140
 him.

95
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:54,140
 It was amazing.

96
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:55,140
 I think as well.

97
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:57,500
 He had a lot of weird stuff happen, but he did sort of invite some of it.

98
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:01,300
 There's a story about he paid money to play Macbeth in the performance, or the Scottish

99
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:02,820
 play.

100
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:07,060
 And he thought the actor playing Macbeth was upstaging him, so he refused to die.

101
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:09,380
 And just like Harry Donne.

102
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:14,060
 Apparently, that was before he started doing a poetry, so it was in his first career.

103
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:15,860
 And there was a review of that players.

104
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:19,580
 I think it's one of the earliest times he appears in any write-up, but there was a reviewer

105
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:24,540
 in the channel who eventually wrote that after an extremely long sword fight, where despite

106
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:28,660
 being hit multiple times, he's not dying, the reviewer wrote that McDuff resolved the

107
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:33,100
 matter in a rather undignified way by taking the feet from under the principal character.

108
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:37,420
 So he had to be rugby tackle on stage.

109
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:39,300
 He was almost never paid to write a poem.

110
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:44,020
 It all came from public readings, but the very few times he was paid was when he wrote

111
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:46,180
 advert poems for things.

112
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:48,780
 So beechems, you know, the beechems pills.

113
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:50,540
 Like a cough, something.

114
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:51,540
 Yeah, exactly.

115
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:53,340
 And so when they were launched, they were kind of cural.

116
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:56,260
 They were meant to cure absolutely everything, but they didn't really have anything in them.

117
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:57,980
 They had aloe, ginger and soap.

118
00:05:57,980 --> 00:05:58,980
 That was what was in them.

119
00:05:58,980 --> 00:05:59,980
 So.

120
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:00,980
 Yeah.

121
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:06,780
 So for a fee, he wrote the following, "What ho, sickly people of high and low degree?

122
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:12,300
 I pray you all be warned by me no matter what may be your bodily ills, the safest and quickest

123
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:14,300
 cure is beechems pills."

124
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:15,300
 It's quite good.

125
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:16,300
 Yeah.

126
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:17,300
 I want some beechems right now.

127
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:18,300
 Yeah.

128
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:19,300
 Just hearing that.

129
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:20,300
 How did that start again?

130
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:22,300
 What ho, sickly people of high and low degree?

131
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:26,100
 You frequently did that kind of bang headline at the start of a poem.

132
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:31,100
 So he went to New York and his poem there starts, "Oh, mighty city of New York.

133
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:32,500
 You are wonderful to behold.

134
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:35,180
 Your buildings are magnificent, the truth be it told.

135
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:40,060
 They were the only things that seemed to arrest my eye, because many of them are 13 stories

136
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:41,060
 high."

137
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:45,740
 It's so weird, isn't it, because you don't know whether to feel sorry for him or not, because

138
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:48,700
 he did seem oblivious and he kept on almost asking for it.

139
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:54,100
 So he'd always dress up in full Scottish regalia with, you know, kilton, spiron and stuff.

140
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:57,420
 Even on the trip to America, he was dressed like that all the time.

141
00:06:57,420 --> 00:07:02,260
 And the thick skinness means that there are some psychologists who agree with the historian

142
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:06,900
 who first suggested he might have been slightly autistic, partly based on the fact that he

143
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:13,340
 seemed immune almost to this constant criticism, and also his obsessive repetition of stuff.

144
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:18,620
 So over 60 of his poems begin with the word twos, and the phrase "beautiful to be seen" is

145
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:19,620
 in about 50 of them.

146
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:23,180
 Yeah, really proud of that line, I know.

147
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:24,180
 It's an incredible line.

148
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:25,980
 Shakespeare would have been proud.

149
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:28,580
 I found this really interesting, and I don't know if this is well known.

150
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:34,540
 Professor McGonagall is named after William McGonagall, and J.K. Rowling has actually confirmed

151
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:35,540
 that that is the case.

152
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:39,980
 Yeah, she said she likes the idea of someone so fabulous being named after someone so absurd.

153
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:44,540
 Which I thought was, because McGonagall is a, she's a complex character by the standards

154
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:45,540
 of Harry Potter, isn't she?

155
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:46,860
 She's not totally good.

156
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:48,780
 She can be a bit of a strict old cow sometimes.

157
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:52,500
 Oh, well, that's not me saying that, but we're not.

158
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,060
 We're not willing to talk about that.

159
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:57,060
 Classic slither and sentence from Anna there.

160
00:07:57,060 --> 00:08:00,040
 I used to live in Edinburgh, and there's a lot of street names that you recognise from

161
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:03,660
 Harry Potter books, and near the statue of Graveyard, as well as a churchyard, and there's a gravestone

162
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:04,660
 for Tom Riddle.

163
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:05,660
 Really?

164
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:06,660
 Yeah, you can see the actual.

165
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:07,660
 Yeah.

166
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:11,140
 And what's interesting about that is that is the exact same graveyard where William McGonagall

167
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:13,140
 was buried, which I've been to, I've visited.

168
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:15,260
 He's saying William McGonagall was Lord Voldemort.

169
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:20,140
 I've said, I think J.K. Rowling took a quick creative trip to the graveyard and bashed

170
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:21,220
 out all the names she needed.

171
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:32,300
 Okay, it is time for fact number two, and that is Andy.

172
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:37,620
 My fact is that one third of all the hazelnuts in the world go into Ferreiro products.

173
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:43,100
 Yeah, so Ferreiro, Roche, Nutella, things like this.

174
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:44,820
 Tic Tacs, which they also make.

175
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:46,340
 How many hazelnuts in Tic Tac?

176
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:47,340
 About 75?

177
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:48,340
 Yeah.

178
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:49,340
 About one per Tic Tac.

179
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:56,340
 So, yeah, this is a piece that was published in Forbes recently, and it was a profile of

180
00:08:56,340 --> 00:09:00,780
 the company, basically, which is a very well-established family firm, basically.

181
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:05,940
 It started in the 1930s with one man who had one pastry shop, and it's now become a thing

182
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:08,420
 that uses a third of all the hazelnuts in the world.

183
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:09,420
 Yeah, they're a big deal.

184
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:10,420
 They're a big deal.

185
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:11,420
 I was saying.

186
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:15,980
 And the main owner, he passed away, only four years ago, Michelle Ferreiro.

187
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:20,300
 And his fortune was up to 15 billion.

188
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:23,900
 His top 50, well, the guy now is top 50 richest people in the world.

189
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:28,260
 It's massive, but Michelle, people always said, was a very, very humble man, didn't they?

190
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:33,940
 So he was the guy who, basically, his dad made the Nutella chocolate, but he made it in

191
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:37,420
 sort of a loaf that was quite hard and sold it in slices.

192
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:41,900
 This was in post-war rationing time, and he thought a way of sort of recreating chocolates

193
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:44,620
 to add hazelnuts instead, because it's a chocolate shortage.

194
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:48,900
 Yeah, he sold it in slices, like bread, and he used to give a slice of Nutella away free

195
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:52,980
 with each loaf of bread as a way of kind of pushing it.

196
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:58,620
 And then his son, Michelle, added some oil, and then it got all spreadable, and the rest

197
00:09:58,620 --> 00:09:59,620
 is his favorite.

198
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:03,820
 And it's so confusing, because Nutella was originally sold as pasta.

199
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:04,820
 What?

200
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:05,820
 Yeah, what?

201
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:11,820
 As in its name, it was sold, you bought pasta janduia, and it was a, that's how it was

202
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:12,820
 sold.

203
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:13,820
 It's because it's paced, right?

204
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:14,820
 Yeah.

205
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:15,820
 Yeah.

206
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:16,820
 Yeah.

207
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:17,820
 They don't get it.

208
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:18,820
 So you boil it?

209
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:19,820
 No, it's exactly as Anna was saying.

210
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:21,820
 It turns out you see kicking pasta, and then it's a loaf of bread.

211
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:22,820
 I'm so confused.

212
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:23,820
 Yeah.

213
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:26,260
 Because the Italian pasta is just going to be Italian for paced, right?

214
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:27,260
 Wait, so it'll be paced.

215
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:32,460
 When the Italians say pasta, they don't eat pasta like we do at all in Italy.

216
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:33,460
 What?

217
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:34,860
 It's all spreadable.

218
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:41,460
 Do you know where loads of their factories originally were?

219
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:42,460
 They were old.

220
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:43,460
 They were also factories.

221
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:47,740
 But a lot of the factories they started off with were former Nazi missile factories.

222
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:48,740
 Yeah.

223
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:52,820
 I guess there were a lot of empty ones, and they were like, "We'll use the space."

224
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:53,820
 Yeah.

225
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:54,820
 That's true.

226
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:55,820
 That's true.

227
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:58,460
 The usage rate of Nazi missile factories dropped off dramatically.

228
00:10:58,460 --> 00:10:59,460
 Yeah.

229
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:03,620
 I can't imagine looking at the machinery and thinking, "I think we can adjust this just

230
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:06,060
 a little bit and make chocolates out of it."

231
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:07,060
 No.

232
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:10,860
 Also, it's amazing how Nutella's managed to shake off the reputation, isn't it?

233
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:15,860
 Just like Volkswagen, they're both born of Nazism, and yet somehow it's fine to possess

234
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:16,860
 them both.

235
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:17,860
 Are they?

236
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:18,860
 They wasn't made by Nazism, Nutella.

237
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:21,100
 Well, it's got the associations, hasn't it?

238
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:22,100
 What's the association?

239
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:23,100
 The factories?

240
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:24,100
 Nutella.

241
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:25,100
 But that's post-war.

242
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:26,100
 That's post-war factories.

243
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:29,980
 I'm not actually suggesting a boycott Nutella, because I think I'll lose one of my food

244
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:32,100
 grips if we do.

245
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:35,980
 Well, they kind of is a link, I'm afraid, to Italian fascism.

246
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:40,780
 So Pietro, who's the guy who founded the company, in 1938, he moved to East Africa

247
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:44,580
 trying to sell biscuits to Mussolini's troops who were stationed there.

248
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:45,580
 Oh, did he?

249
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:48,380
 So there's a little bit of a link, but not a full-on link, obviously.

250
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:52,180
 Yeah, as I'll say in Trenton Nutella, isn't there using hazelnuts?

251
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:55,180
 Was because of the rationing from the war, so it came out of the consequences rather

252
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:56,580
 than because of the ideologies?

253
00:11:56,580 --> 00:11:57,580
 Yes.

254
00:11:57,580 --> 00:11:58,580
 Yes.

255
00:11:58,580 --> 00:11:59,580
 Fascists didn't make Nutella.

256
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:00,580
 I've never claimed that.

257
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:01,580
 Nutella, please, don't sue me.

258
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:02,580
 So hazelnuts?

259
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:03,580
 Mm-hmm.

260
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:04,580
 Yeah.

261
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:08,580
 Three quarters of the world's hazelnuts come from Turkey.

262
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:09,580
 Yeah.

263
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:11,620
 I don't know, is there absolutely a corner of the market?

264
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:16,420
 And a quarter of the world's hazelnuts, so one third of those produced in Turkey, itself

265
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:20,020
 three quarters of the total, a quarter of the world's hazelnuts are produced in a single

266
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:21,020
 Turkish town.

267
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:22,020
 Yeah.

268
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:23,020
 He's on uptown.

269
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:27,100
 And they had a terrible frost in 2014, and a third of the harvest was wiped out and prices

270
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:28,100
 rose by 60%.

271
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:30,100
 Yeah, this is all doable, isn't it?

272
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:31,100
 Yeah, all doable.

273
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:32,100
 Exactly.

274
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:34,180
 I mean, obviously, it's in the fields around the town.

275
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:35,540
 It's not exclusively in the town.

276
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:39,180
 But Nutella is trying to smash the cornering of the market, yeah, because they want

277
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:44,660
 a bit of variety in case there's another frost, so they're moving into Georgia and Abkhazia,

278
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:49,300
 another traditionally very calm and politically easygoing region, which won't be.

279
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:52,220
 So they pray to a lot of local politics, basically.

280
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:53,220
 Yeah.

281
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:57,820
 But every year, they have half a million tons of hazelnut shells to get rid of.

282
00:12:57,820 --> 00:12:59,220
 What do they do with them?

283
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:00,900
 They sell them for cheap heating fuel.

284
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:01,900
 Oh, cool.

285
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:04,180
 And I can't remember what else they do.

286
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:06,980
 Well, here's one thing that the Ferreiro people do.

287
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:10,700
 They use the hazelnut shells, and they've been testing, and I don't know if this has been

288
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:11,700
 put into practice.

289
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:12,700
 This was a few years ago.

290
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:17,180
 They've been making it into the wrapping that we have for, yeah, so they've reintegrated

291
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:21,180
 it into the packaging to make themselves totally resourceful of all the--

292
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:22,180
 The Nutella.

293
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:23,180
 No, for Ferreiro.

294
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:24,660
 That's the gold stuff.

295
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:27,060
 This is from the project coordinator at Ferreiro.

296
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:32,060
 We have access to large amounts of residual byproducts, which we realize could be used constructively.

297
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:37,020
 So the company's idea was to use the nuts to create the packaging for the chocolates.

298
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:42,460
 Hey, if you ever want to know what to call a specific bit of a Ferreirochet, I have the

299
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:43,460
 answer.

300
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:44,460
 Wow.

301
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:46,940
 So I was reading about how it goes through the factory, and you know, it's got all these amazing

302
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:51,660
 devices that, for instance, sense if it's misshapen and automatically puff a bit of air

303
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:55,620
 to knock it off the production line, and all that funky stuff.

304
00:13:55,620 --> 00:14:00,620
 And then there's a moment where all of Ferreirochet is, is this wafer ball, that rounded wafer,

305
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:06,200
 which, by the way, took him, Ferreiro, five years, the story goes, to try and hone how to make

306
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:10,540
 a wafer curl, apparently he was in his factory on his own for five years, that's as a legend

307
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:11,540
 goes.

308
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:12,540
 I like the person with that.

309
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:15,260
 But he curls the wafer, and then they're in the factory, and they've got hazelnut in

310
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:16,580
 them, and Nutella spread.

311
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:20,180
 And before they're dipped in chocolate and hazelnuts, that little ball is called a pickpock.

312
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:21,180
 Wow.

313
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:22,180
 Just in case--

314
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:25,220
 So if you ever suck the chocolate off the outside of a Ferreirochet, you can say, "I've got

315
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:26,220
 a pickpock."

316
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:27,540
 So they've got tick-tax pickpocks.

317
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:31,260
 That's very good naming, they should market that.

318
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:33,420
 I don't want to eat one that someone else has taken the chocolate off.

319
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:34,420
 I know.

320
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:35,420
 Sure.

321
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:41,100
 I was reading a bit about the fact that this family that created the whole Ferreiro

322
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:45,380
 empire are incredibly secretive, we were saying humble before, but it was also incredibly

323
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:46,380
 secretive.

324
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:49,980
 No one knew virtually anything about them, and for a company that was so massive, they

325
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:53,060
 never did any real publicity of their own.

326
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:56,780
 Their website, it was spotted in the telegraph back in 2009.

327
00:14:56,780 --> 00:15:02,500
 This is since changed, so possibly since the owner Michelle had died, but they only had one

328
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:07,580
 financial press release on their website up until 2009, and it was two sentences long, and

329
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:09,060
 that's the only thing they ever had.

330
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:13,060
 Yeah, he gave one interview Michelle in his whole career, and even when he gave that interview,

331
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:16,220
 which was right towards the end of it, before he died, he wore dark glasses the whole way

332
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:17,220
 through.

333
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:18,220
 Yeah.

334
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:19,220
 I think it wasn't actually him.

335
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:20,220
 Yeah, you're right.

336
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:21,220
 He blatantly said that.

337
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:22,220
 He said your media savvy.

338
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:23,220
 Yeah.

339
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:24,860
 A media savvy umpulumpa from the factory.

340
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:25,860
 Oh wow.

341
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:26,860
 It's still his brother who's in charge.

342
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:27,860
 It's not Giovanni.

343
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:28,860
 Hmm.

344
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:29,860
 Yeah.

345
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:32,660
 They're basically like real life Willy Wonka, so without the killing off with children.

346
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:33,660
 That's true.

347
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:34,660
 Not killing, but like...

348
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:35,660
 It's far away.

349
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:39,460
 Well, someone else has joined the sweepstake to get sued by Nutella.

350
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:42,940
 I don't think the role dollar state has just come into.

351
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:44,700
 You're going to be sued by Harry Potter.

352
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:45,700
 Well, why?

353
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:46,700
 I was...

354
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:47,700
 No, that was Anna again.

355
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:48,700
 It's all me.

356
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:49,700
 Because of the graveyard.

357
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:50,700
 No.

358
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:51,700
 That's real.

359
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:52,700
 And Willy McGonagall's buried there, and there is a Thomas Riddle.

360
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:53,700
 Oh, yeah.

361
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:56,060
 He did claim JK Rowling has no imagination.

362
00:15:56,060 --> 00:15:59,860
 She just called this around graveyards like a creep, stealing her ideas off the gravestones.

363
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:02,060
 JK Rowling is the greatest writer that our world has ever known.

364
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:03,060
 It's too late now, though.

365
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:04,060
 Oh, man.

366
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:05,060
 We've said the words.

367
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:08,660
 Um, I found out something about Shakespeare's Globe, because Shakespeare's Globe was partly

368
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:09,940
 built on Hazelnut shells.

369
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:10,940
 What?

370
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:11,940
 Wow.

371
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:15,220
 So they were excavating the original one before it was rebuilt.

372
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:19,780
 And what they found, a layer of hazelnut shells, and they assumed that maybe this is the

373
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:22,940
 leftovers from people snacking on them, but it turns out that that wasn't the case

374
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:28,140
 because they were an ingredient in a kind of mortar, what was called a poor man's mortar.

375
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:32,820
 So it was mixed with cinders and ash, and it let the rainwater filter through about support

376
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:33,820
 of the building.

377
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:38,460
 So when they rebuilt the theatre, the theatre sourced seven and a half tons of hazelnut

378
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:45,780
 shells from Turkey, sort of a special military plane flew them over, and they were pounded

379
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:47,940
 into a mortar and they were put under the floor.

380
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:49,860
 So the Globe today is still on Hazelnut shells.

381
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:50,860
 That's extraordinary.

382
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:51,860
 That's cool.

383
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:52,860
 That is so cool.

384
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:57,340
 Sometimes need a button, like an alarm for like best facts of the podcast, that is cool.

385
00:16:57,340 --> 00:16:59,340
 Okay, we've hit best facts.

386
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:04,020
 They used to be called hazelnuts, until really recently, they used to be called filbits.

387
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:05,940
 Now, have you guys ever called them filbits?

388
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:06,940
 No.

389
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:10,340
 Because I was just reading an ask in the Atlantic, which happened to be from 1996, and someone

390
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:14,940
 said the filbert, or as people seem to be calling it these days, they hazelnut shells.

391
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:15,940
 You find them nonsense.

392
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:16,940
 Isn't that weird?

393
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:17,940
 Oh, that's nice.

394
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:18,940
 I'm simply saying it back.

395
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:19,940
 Should we move on?

396
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:20,940
 Yeah, yeah.

397
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:21,940
 Oh, can I just mention that?

398
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:23,860
 Oh, can I just mention Nutella jars.

399
00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:26,660
 In 2015, one caused a fire.

400
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:31,300
 This was in Twickenham, and Sunrays refracted from an empty Nutella jar that was left on a window

401
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:34,580
 sill, and it burned an entire house down and killed a pet dog.

402
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:37,140
 So don't leave your Nutella jars out.

403
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:38,140
 And don't sue us Nutella.

404
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:39,140
 What?

405
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:41,140
 Hannah, you absolutely gone for it.

406
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:42,140
 They're Nazis.

407
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:46,380
 They'll burn your house down.

408
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:56,740
 OK, it is time for fact number three, and that is Chazinski.

409
00:17:56,740 --> 00:18:02,740
 My fact is that the earliest depicted sofas were five feet high off the ground.

410
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:08,500
 There's this great article in the Paris Review, which is a review of a book called Now I Sit Me Down

411
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:12,940
 by a guy called Wittold Ribzinski, and I really want to read it.

412
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:20,300
 And in that, he mentions this couch, which appears in an alabaster carving from the seventh century

413
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:26,420
 called The Garden Party, and it's from Assyria, and it shows a king reclining on a sofa and

414
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:27,740
 it's five feet high.

415
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:31,940
 And he's got its queen slightly below him on an also quite high chair that has a footstool

416
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:33,300
 to mount it.

417
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:38,900
 And so, yeah, the earliest sofas were like that, and this was in Nineveh and 645 BC.

418
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:43,740
 And the height of your furniture, apparently, was related to where your social standing was.

419
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:47,940
 Do you know that the French word for sofa is canape, so if you're in France and someone

420
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:50,700
 offers you a canape, they're offering you a sofa.

421
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:51,700
 Really?

422
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:54,220
 They're much more generous at their dinner party.

423
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:56,220
 They gave out so many canapes.

424
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:58,580
 Yeah, it's because it's a sofa for the thing to go on, isn't it?

425
00:18:58,580 --> 00:19:01,660
 We call it that because it's like a couch for the food to sit on.

426
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:02,660
 What?

427
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:03,660
 Yeah, the food relaxes.

428
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:04,660
 The food to sit on.

429
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:08,940
 Traditionally, it's stale bread, it's supposed to be an canape, and so the stale bread acts

430
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:13,740
 as a sofa, and then you plonk your salmon on top of it, and that's a canape.

431
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:14,740
 That's great.

432
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:15,740
 I didn't know that.

433
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:17,500
 You may have lost your best fat to the podcast.

434
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:18,500
 Yeah.

435
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:22,100
 Do you know that in the '50s, there was a trend for cardboard sofas?

436
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:23,100
 What?

437
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:24,100
 What?

438
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:28,380
 Yeah, there was an article in popular mechanics in 1954, it was that they called the trend

439
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:32,300
 paperboard furniture, and they were very excited about it because you could use pulp

440
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:35,020
 and waste paper, and so it could be recycled, or you could find it in different ways, very

441
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:39,620
 lightweight, and I quote, "The furniture is relatively inexpensive, extremely strong and

442
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:41,420
 durable, and can be disassembled when you move.

443
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:44,500
 Newlyweds can use it to bridge the gap until they can afford the kind of furniture they

444
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:45,500
 want for life."

445
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:51,340
 It's basically rather than send you a box of stuff in it, just take the box.

446
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:56,340
 Sofas are one of the reasons why Romans did away with cutlery for a while, so that reclining

447
00:19:56,340 --> 00:20:00,980
 on couches became really popular and was brought from the Arabic world, the Middle East,

448
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:06,220
 where this original fact was from, into Europe, and the word sofa comes from an Arabic word,

449
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:10,580
 so the Romans started doing it, and then you're using one hand to lean on, you know, you're

450
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:14,460
 propped up on one elbow, and so you can only eat with one hand, and so you can't be having

451
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:16,300
 cutlery because it gets right in the way.

452
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:19,980
 It just looks so uncomfortable, the Roman way of dining, where you're lying on your side

453
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:23,460
 on a couch with a table with food on it next to you.

454
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:24,460
 It just looks mad.

455
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:25,460
 Yeah.

456
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:27,500
 And it takes up so much space, because everyone's lying down.

457
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:28,500
 Yeah.

458
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:31,380
 The theory is that that's how the last supper happened.

459
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:36,780
 Everyone was lying on their sides in a kind of u-shape, so you'd have about four people

460
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:42,420
 per side, each side of the u, but it does mean that you're facing someone's back, the third

461
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:46,340
 line, in front of you, facing away from you, and the guy behind you is facing your back

462
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:47,340
 and trying to talk to you.

463
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:51,940
 And you've got someone's foot in your face, but I was just thinking, you'd want to make

464
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:55,460
 sure you're on the right part of the room, because there's a thing about if you go to

465
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:58,760
 sleep on your left side, you look like you get indigestion, because you're a food engineer

466
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:04,060
 self-aggressive, because that way, so if you lie on your right, there's one way that you

467
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:08,260
 lie, you can get indigestion, because the food can't go in easy, and one way that's easier.

468
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:11,620
 So if you're lying on the wrong side in the room, I mean, lying down still not great, but

469
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:13,260
 maybe it would be slightly more comfortable.

470
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:17,260
 I think I'd risk indigestion just to have a conversation with a human, rather than

471
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:18,260
 it.

472
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:19,260
 Maybe.

473
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:20,260
 You roll it in a circle.

474
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:21,260
 But maybe it was all viral.

475
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:24,580
 They all turn it to lie the same way, often in those paintings, so maybe they'd

476
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:25,580
 crack this indigestion thing.

477
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:26,980
 They were like turning around you.

478
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:27,980
 Yeah.

479
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:28,980
 That's really amazing.

480
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:29,980
 I didn't know that.

481
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:33,940
 So the furniture generally is quite recent, almost all the furniture we see today, there

482
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:37,540
 was an article in the New York Times that was saying pretty much everything you see was invented

483
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:40,260
 between 1670 and 1730.

484
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:44,740
 So once sofas came about, like a lot of things, after ancient Roman ancient Greece and everything

485
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:51,900
 fell, they just disappeared, didn't come back for ages, and things like armchairs or sofas

486
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:55,940
 or basically everything except just one table where you do everything, and then your bed

487
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:57,140
 just wasn't a thing.

488
00:21:57,140 --> 00:22:01,820
 And along with it, apparently came the new sofa attitude, which was when women started

489
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:06,660
 being a bit sexier and more relaxed, because the sofa encourages you to slightly drape

490
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:08,260
 yourself over it.

491
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:13,140
 So there's a theory that that kind of loosened up women's behaviour and morals, I think.

492
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:14,140
 Wow.

493
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:18,660
 So suddenly, men around the world were going, "Hey, there's some sexy ladies, all of us

494
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:19,660
 started."

495
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:21,460
 That's when the population started to really rise.

496
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:22,460
 Yeah.

497
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:23,460
 Wow.

498
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:27,740
 I did find out about the first man to make a chair factory, because before this guy, he

499
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:33,540
 was called Michael Thonne, he was a Frenchman, all chairs were lovingly handcrafted and made.

500
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:38,100
 He was born in 1796, and in Vienna, 40 or 50 years later, in mid 19th century, lots and

501
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:44,100
 lots of restaurants and cafes and coffee houses are opening, and they need chairs, they need

502
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:47,780
 hundreds and hundreds and thousands and thousands of chairs, and it's too much effort

503
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:51,900
 for individual craftsmen that laboriously carve chairs.

504
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:56,420
 So he had this brilliant method where he would cut wood into strips, he'd boil bundles

505
00:22:56,420 --> 00:23:01,620
 of them in glue, and then he'd bend them into the shape in a mold that he wanted them

506
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:02,620
 to be.

507
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:06,860
 So it's more effective way of doing it, and then he'd develop ways of bending whole wood,

508
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:09,020
 you know, whole pieces of wood.

509
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:13,260
 So it was bending rather than jamming together, which is obviously much less labour intensive.

510
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:16,740
 Yeah, and then Demand grew so high that he had to open five factories by the time he

511
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:17,740
 died.

512
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:21,460
 So he was a huge share pie in there, thousands of thousands, it's weird to think of the

513
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:24,820
 first ever jazz factory, Michael Thonne.

514
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:25,820
 Michael Thonne.

515
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:26,820
 Yeah.

516
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:30,420
 Then on the very opposite mass produced, you know, when Kim Kardashian and Kanye West got

517
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:34,920
 married, they had for their meal, they had a massive custom made marble table, and instead

518
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:37,820
 of place card, they had everyone's names engraved in the marble table.

519
00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:42,900
 But they got married, and it's late, I don't know, he's transport that back to California.

520
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:43,900
 Oh, wow.

521
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:45,900
 Imagine having a last minute seat as if they changed.

522
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:46,900
 Yeah.

523
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:47,900
 We've actually fallen out.

524
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:48,900
 Can we sit apart?

525
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:49,900
 No.

526
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:50,900
 Yeah.

527
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:51,900
 Unfortunately, you're a...oh my goodness.

528
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:52,900
 It's literally set in stone.

529
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:53,900
 No.

530
00:23:53,900 --> 00:24:06,540
 Okay, it's time for our final fact of the show, and that is Anne.

531
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:10,580
 My fact is that the first adverb to be shown on channel five was first and now number five.

532
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:11,580
 So good.

533
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:12,580
 Lovely.

534
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:13,580
 So nice.

535
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:14,580
 Very pleasing.

536
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:23,660
 So, it launched on 30th March, 1997, the Spice Girls launched channel five, where they sang

537
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:26,900
 the song five, four, three, two, one, but turned into one, two, three, four, five.

538
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:27,900
 Yeah.

539
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:28,900
 It was a night of wild entertainment.

540
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:31,940
 I watched it this morning, because I've never seen it before.

541
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:33,180
 It was the full launch night.

542
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:34,180
 Do you remember it?

543
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:35,180
 Do you remember it?

544
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:36,180
 Yeah.

545
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:39,180
 I remember very excitingly people turning up to re-jig the TV.

546
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:40,180
 Yeah.

547
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:41,180
 Because they were only four channels then.

548
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:42,180
 So it's like we were getting 20% more.

549
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:43,180
 Yeah.

550
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:44,180
 Yeah.

551
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:46,580
 I was wondering about what brilliant programmes some five would hold.

552
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:47,580
 Little did we know.

553
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:51,660
 Why, forgotten though, was that half an hour of the launch night was just showing trailers

554
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:52,940
 for shows that were coming soon.

555
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:53,940
 Yes.

556
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:54,940
 I think was it.

557
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:55,940
 Yeah.

558
00:24:55,940 --> 00:24:56,940
 Clever.

559
00:24:56,940 --> 00:25:01,420
 The first ever adverb that was put onto TV was in the 50s, and it was ITV's launch night.

560
00:25:01,420 --> 00:25:06,980
 It was the first time it went on, and it was an adverb for toothpaste, Gibbs SR toothpaste.

561
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:10,620
 And it's quite cool, because, you know, first TV adverb, and already they were employing

562
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:13,020
 a lot of the tricks that are used in modern day adverts.

563
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:18,100
 So the toothbrush itself was in a big block of ice, and obviously you can't use a big block

564
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:21,060
 of ice on a set, you know, it'll melt too quickly.

565
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:22,260
 So it was made out of plastic.

566
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:25,780
 So immediately they were using fake props to be the actual thing.

567
00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:26,780
 Yeah, it's quite cool.

568
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:27,780
 But yeah, so that was 16.

569
00:25:27,780 --> 00:25:30,620
 And that was the first in the UK, wasn't it, because there was advertising.

570
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:31,620
 Exactly.

571
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:32,620
 It was the first in the UK, yeah.

572
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:36,900
 I read a really strange thing about advertising now in the future of it.

573
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:40,900
 So did you know that with old sitcoms and old, but like relatively finished sitcoms,

574
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:44,140
 like however I met your mother, what they're doing now is they're still selling advertising

575
00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:47,700
 spots, because they're going in, they're digitally altering the shows for products that came

576
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:49,860
 out after the show's finish.

577
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:50,860
 Oh, yeah.

578
00:25:50,860 --> 00:25:51,860
 So, gee.

579
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:52,860
 So like for a film.

580
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:54,620
 So like for a kind of a new software.

581
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:58,460
 Yeah, well the example was about a movie that come out a few years after the episodes.

582
00:25:58,460 --> 00:26:02,100
 They changed, I think, a TV screen and a coffee shop, and they've been a lamp post in one

583
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:03,100
 scene.

584
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:04,620
 They put a poster for the film on the lamp post.

585
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:07,620
 So they're selling this like digital space in shows.

586
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:09,460
 It was just called me so many questions.

587
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:10,460
 Yeah.

588
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:11,460
 How is this?

589
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:12,460
 I didn't know this film was coming out.

590
00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:14,060
 That's such a fun idea of updating there.

591
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:19,460
 Like the way that Anna just went, oh, um, gee, if like in 40 years time someone's listening

592
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:26,460
 to this and we digitally insert whatever the, you know, PTD, you know, what she's going

593
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:27,460
 to stand for.

594
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:28,460
 What exactly?

595
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:29,460
 Uh, prime time.

596
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:30,460
 Time.

597
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:31,460
 Time.

598
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:32,460
 Time dude.

599
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:33,460
 Time dude.

600
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:34,460
 Time dude.

601
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:37,380
 If we're saying that, that is not a world I want to live in.

602
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:41,220
 I read a thing about the first adverts ever, but this wasn't Wikipedia and I haven't been

603
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:45,700
 able to back it up independently, but it's that the earliest adverts were in China and that

604
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:47,140
 they were oral.

605
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:51,340
 So you would get bamboo flutes played to sell confectionery.

606
00:26:51,340 --> 00:26:55,300
 I think the first advertising was sort of going around playing a flute and saying, hey,

607
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:56,300
 do you want to buy some sweets?

608
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:59,540
 Oh, so you would, you would create a, a jingle on your flute?

609
00:26:59,540 --> 00:27:01,060
 I think so, but I'm not sure.

610
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:04,700
 I think in the UK there was a version where they would, um, like early, like sort of

611
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:08,540
 flowering they would hand out leaflets and it would have the sheet music so you could sing

612
00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:09,540
 the jingle to yourself.

613
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:12,220
 You could take it home and be like, that's right.

614
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:13,220
 That's very fun.

615
00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:14,220
 So weird.

616
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:15,940
 She's so funny.

617
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:17,340
 So much less appealing.

618
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:21,980
 The idea of something being advertised by your dad, kind of badly, kind of interpret sheet

619
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:22,980
 music.

620
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:26,580
 I reckon we can set that up, um, William McGonagall beach of music.

621
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:27,580
 Yes.

622
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:28,580
 Yes.

623
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:29,580
 You're right.

624
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:31,980
 If it had been handed out with a flyer, people loved it.

625
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:32,980
 Yeah.

626
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:34,980
 There's no what the cheese pull is.

627
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:35,980
 The cheese pull.

628
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:36,980
 The cheese pull.

629
00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:37,980
 An advertising term.

630
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:38,980
 Okay.

631
00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:41,340
 Uh, and it guesses, um, cheese pull.

632
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:47,620
 I feel like a thing of cheese sounds like a bayou ball on a string, um, close-ish.

633
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:53,460
 I think it's an advert that offers you something exciting, like a cheese, but then it pulls it away.

634
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:57,100
 So it leaves you curious and it leaves you to go and find out more about the products.

635
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:58,700
 These are brilliant guesses.

636
00:27:58,700 --> 00:27:59,860
 None of them are even close.

637
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:04,740
 You know, in pizza adverts, when, um, the pizza slice gets pulled away from the pizza, every

638
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:09,980
 pizza ad, the cheese pulls away and that's the cheese pull and all adverts like perfume or

639
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:10,980
 pizza have it.

640
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:12,220
 Adverts that are trying to advertise something.

641
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:16,180
 I've never seen a perfume advert, but it's a big, slightly pulled apart.

642
00:28:16,180 --> 00:28:20,740
 Guys, it's, it's become a metaphor for a broader advertising technique, uh, which is

643
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:25,540
 basically using an image that specifically really, really triggers your different senses

644
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:26,540
 that aren't sight.

645
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:30,580
 In my visual suggestion, you see that cheese, but it triggers your sense of taste.

646
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:32,060
 So, and I watched a lot for this research.

647
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:33,060
 You desperately want pizza.

648
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:36,160
 There's a way thing with perfume that you're, you're advertising something that you can't

649
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:37,160
 show because it's a smell.

650
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:38,160
 Exactly.

651
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:40,260
 So you can't be like, oh, look how great it looks.

652
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:44,700
 I guess it's about why you have complicated bottles, but you want to sort of give the vibe

653
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:45,700
 of what you're selling.

654
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:46,700
 Yeah.

655
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:47,700
 It's rather than the actual product.

656
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:48,700
 That's why you need the cheese pull.

657
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:49,700
 Wow.

658
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:50,700
 Because you can't actually show a smell.

659
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:52,700
 Um, I found another thing about perfume.

660
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:57,500
 In 2014, a Californian firm announced that they were making perfume for cows.

661
00:28:57,500 --> 00:28:58,500
 Okay.

662
00:28:58,500 --> 00:28:59,500
 Good.

663
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:00,500
 Good.

664
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:04,780
 But for human benefit, so the idea was to make cows smell like humans.

665
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:05,780
 No.

666
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:06,780
 Yes.

667
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:09,980
 So mosquitoes would bite the cows instead of biting people.

668
00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:11,780
 It's definitely going to be unintended consequences.

669
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:12,780
 That's so bad.

670
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:13,780
 That's so bad.

671
00:29:13,780 --> 00:29:22,180
 Um, I was reading that Benjamin Franklin wanted, wants to invent a perfume.

672
00:29:22,180 --> 00:29:27,540
 And it was an anus perfume as in what if we turned our farts into perfume?

673
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:28,540
 What if?

674
00:29:28,540 --> 00:29:29,540
 Well captured them.

675
00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:30,540
 No.

676
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:31,540
 No.

677
00:29:31,540 --> 00:29:32,540
 Yeah.

678
00:29:32,540 --> 00:29:33,540
 Although that is something that people used to do.

679
00:29:33,540 --> 00:29:38,940
 But what he wanted was for scientists to focus on creating some kind of medicine that you

680
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:42,620
 would take that would mix with the gases that were down there.

681
00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:46,220
 So that when you did fart, it would come out with Chanel number five.

682
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:47,220
 Yes.

683
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:48,220
 Did he have a suggestion?

684
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:49,220
 And what did he?

685
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:50,220
 No.

686
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:51,220
 He was asking for scientists to look into it.

687
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:52,220
 It was, but that was his idea.

688
00:29:52,220 --> 00:29:54,300
 We can all ask for scientists to look into stuff.

689
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:56,580
 Yeah, but not all of us in Benjamin Franklin.

690
00:29:56,580 --> 00:29:57,580
 In Venice too.

691
00:29:57,580 --> 00:30:00,900
 Can I just say one thing, which I don't think we've ever mentioned.

692
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:02,780
 So the Egyptians were really into perfume.

693
00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:06,460
 You know, we're always finding it in the tombs when we excavate them.

694
00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:11,660
 And they thought that it was like the sweat of the gods and staff.

695
00:30:11,660 --> 00:30:16,060
 So Moe was the sweat of the god Ra and then her ben oil, the different perfume was squeezed

696
00:30:16,060 --> 00:30:17,780
 from the eye of Horus.

697
00:30:17,780 --> 00:30:21,180
 But one thing they used to do was wear perfume cones on their heads.

698
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:23,140
 And that's you see it in a lot of Egyptian art.

699
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:24,140
 Cones.

700
00:30:24,140 --> 00:30:25,700
 Yeah, it's like a black seed cone.

701
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:26,700
 Like an inverted cone.

702
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:27,700
 Party hat.

703
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:28,700
 Cones.

704
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:29,700
 It's like a party hat.

705
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:30,700
 But what it was is a wax cone.

706
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:33,900
 And then I had perfume on the inside and you'd go to a banquet.

707
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:37,980
 And because it was quite hot in Egypt, it would melt as the banquet proceeded and release

708
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:44,140
 the perfume sense into the air, presumably as wax kind of rolled down your face.

709
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:45,140
 And then like dried.

710
00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:46,140
 Yes.

711
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:47,140
 Like in your hair.

712
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:48,140
 Tried and concealed in your hair.

713
00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:52,020
 It's like why spray it on yourself when you can bring the bottle with you.

714
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:53,020
 All the perfume.

715
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:54,020
 You are.

716
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:55,020
 Feel the perfume.

717
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:56,020
 Be the perfume.

718
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:57,020
 You are the perfume.

719
00:30:57,020 --> 00:31:00,220
 I've got a couple of Chanel facts.

720
00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:01,220
 Yeah.

721
00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:04,980
 So Coco Chanel, I didn't know this, wasn't called Coco or Chanel in her birth certificate.

722
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:05,980
 Really?

723
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:06,980
 Yeah.

724
00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:07,980
 So her first thing is Gabrielle.

725
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:08,980
 Coco was a nickname.

726
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:09,980
 And her surname is Chanel.

727
00:31:09,980 --> 00:31:10,980
 But it was originally spot with an S before the end.

728
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:11,980
 So Chasnell.

729
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:12,980
 Chasnell?

730
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:13,980
 Chasnell.

731
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:14,980
 It's got a different ring to it.

732
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:15,980
 That's it.

733
00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:16,980
 That's it.

734
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:17,980
 That's Chasnell.

735
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:18,980
 Chasnell, number five.

736
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:22,500
 Chasnell from Wolverhampton.

737
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:27,820
 And then it takes, so for a 30-millimeter bottle of the perfume, it takes a thousand jasmine

738
00:31:27,820 --> 00:31:31,140
 flowers and twelve roses, which is a lot, into one wee bottle.

739
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:32,140
 And I liked a lot.

740
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:35,020
 If you shop it shut out often enough, you get your own custom mannequin made to your

741
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:36,020
 exact proportions.

742
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:37,020
 I can make you clothes.

743
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:38,020
 No way.

744
00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:40,980
 And I can't have much money you need to spend before you're at mannequin level.

745
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:44,460
 I thought you meant that they made you a custom mannequin so that they can practice spraying

746
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:45,460
 the perfume on you.

747
00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:50,940
 So they measure the dimensions of your neck to make sure that it's right for you.

748
00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:51,940
 So as a design house.

749
00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:52,940
 Sorry.

750
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:53,940
 They have the mannequin.

751
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:54,940
 Wow.

752
00:31:54,940 --> 00:31:55,940
 They make other things.

753
00:31:55,940 --> 00:31:56,940
 I think the perfume is kind of a one-size-fits-all.

754
00:31:56,940 --> 00:31:57,940
 Yes.

755
00:31:57,940 --> 00:31:58,940
 I think the perfume is kind of a one-size-fits-all.

756
00:31:58,940 --> 00:31:59,940
 The jasmine.

757
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:00,940
 The jasmine.

758
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:01,940
 The jasmine.

759
00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:02,940
 We'll have an XL, please.

760
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:03,940
 A lot.

761
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:04,940
 A lot.

762
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:05,940
 A lot of cows to cover in it.

763
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:06,940
 No.

764
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:12,420
 I was reading about the making of Chanel number five, its origins.

765
00:32:12,420 --> 00:32:17,260
 So it was this guy who created fragrances called Ernest Bow.

766
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:24,260
 And when he was presenting his sense to Coco Chanel, he had numerous sense that he wanted

767
00:32:24,260 --> 00:32:25,260
 to show her.

768
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:27,540
 And he numbered them number one to number five.

769
00:32:27,540 --> 00:32:30,660
 And then there was a second batch, which was number 20 to 24.

770
00:32:30,660 --> 00:32:34,220
 And she went through and she picked number five because that was the best one.

771
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:37,100
 It happened to batch of 6 to 19 because that's what I wanted.

772
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:38,100
 Yeah, exactly.

773
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:41,260
 And he never used to smell when he was creating the perfumes.

774
00:32:41,260 --> 00:32:43,900
 He did it all basically like a mathematical formula.

775
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:44,900
 Oh, really?

776
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:49,500
 He knew the smells and he knew the combinations so well that he just used to write the recipes.

777
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:51,460
 And he said it's like writing music.

778
00:32:51,460 --> 00:32:54,340
 Each component has a definite tonal value.

779
00:32:54,340 --> 00:32:56,900
 I can compose a waltz or a funeral march.

780
00:32:56,900 --> 00:32:58,300
 That's quite beautiful.

781
00:32:58,300 --> 00:32:59,300
 Yeah.

782
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:00,300
 Like playing with smells.

783
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:01,300
 Well, what is a good smell?

784
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:02,300
 What?

785
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:03,300
 It's all a bookshit, isn't it?

786
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:04,300
 What?

787
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:06,300
 I mean, there's no smell to this.

788
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:08,140
 Can you just silly flowery smells?

789
00:33:08,140 --> 00:33:15,140
 It's sounding off today's lawsuit challenge with it's all bullshit to the makers of Chanel.

790
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:21,900
 Okay, that's it.

791
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:23,460
 That is all of our facts.
