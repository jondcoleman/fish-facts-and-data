00:00:00,00:00:21,"*another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming to you from"
00:00:21,00:00:24,the QI offices in Covent Garden.
00:00:24,00:00:29,"My name is Dan Schreiber and I am sitting here with Anichezinski, Andrew Hunter Murray"
00:00:29,00:00:34,and Ann Miller and once again we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite
00:00:34,00:00:40,"facts from the last seven days and in no particular order, here we go."
00:00:40,00:00:42,Starting with fact number one and that's my fact this week.
00:00:42,00:00:49,"My fact is that Scottish poet William McGonagall's writing was so bad, a circus hired him to"
00:00:49,00:00:54,give poetry readings under the condition that audiences could pelton with eggs as he
00:00:54,00:00:56,read.
00:00:56,00:00:59,He agreed to do that.
00:00:59,00:01:05,He was paid 15 shillings per performance and he was actually slightly on hard times so
00:01:05,00:01:08,"he accepted it, probably going why I need the money."
00:01:08,00:01:09,And the eggs maybe.
00:01:09,00:01:13,"Yeah and it wasn't just eggs, it was stale bread as well, flour, he got a lot of products"
00:01:13,00:01:14,that he could go home with.
00:01:14,00:01:19,"Unfortunately, the performances were put to an end quite early on and he was disappointed"
00:01:19,00:01:20,about that supposedly.
00:01:20,00:01:23,"Yeah, weren't they put to an end because they were too riotous."
00:01:23,00:01:28,"It was in 1893, the authorities banned them because they were getting so out of control."
00:01:28,00:01:31,People just wildly enthusiastic about pelting him.
00:01:31,00:01:35,"He was pretty tough to get an audience though, he was quite keen to spread his poetry regardless"
00:01:35,00:01:39,"of how much anyone wanted to hear it, so he was like great, they love me."
00:01:39,00:01:42,"Yeah, just a tiny bit of background for anyone who hasn't heard of William McGonagall."
00:01:42,00:01:44,This is a Scottish poet.
00:01:44,00:01:51,"He was born in either 1825 or 1830, it's a bit disputed and he was famous, very, very famous"
00:01:51,00:01:56,"for the terribleness of his poems, married out just so we know what we're dealing with."
00:01:56,00:02:00,"So one of his most famous poems was The Tay Bridge Disaster, where a bridge collapsed and"
00:02:00,00:02:02,lots of people have been killed.
00:02:02,00:02:07,"It starts off, beautiful railway bridge of the Silvery Tay, alas, I am very sorry to say"
00:02:07,00:02:13,"that 90 lives have been taken away on the last Sabbath day of 1879, which will be remembered"
00:02:13,00:02:15,for a very long time.
00:02:15,00:02:18,That's the level of poetry we're dealing with.
00:02:18,00:02:22,And I'm sure it comforted the bereaved family members.
00:02:22,00:02:27,"He was a temperance campaigner and hated alcohol and stuff was too total, and he blamed"
00:02:27,00:02:30,"the fact that no one liked his poetry on alcohol, so he said they were all too drunk to be"
00:02:30,00:02:31,able to appreciate it.
00:02:31,00:02:34,But it does kind of imply that you just say it was the kind of thing you got really pissed
00:02:34,00:02:37,"and then said, should we go and watch some of them again?"
00:02:37,00:02:38,Yeah.
00:02:38,00:02:40,But the last show at the friend just 3 a.m.
00:02:40,00:02:41,Yeah.
00:02:41,00:02:42,Exactly.
00:02:42,00:02:43,Yeah.
00:02:43,00:02:44,"He started a very late in life, didn't he?"
00:02:44,00:02:47,"So he was about 50 give or take, because we don't know exactly when he was born."
00:02:47,00:02:49,"So he was, what was he before that?"
00:02:49,00:02:50,Was he working?
00:02:50,00:02:52,I thought he was looming and we knew.
00:02:52,00:02:53,Yeah.
00:02:53,00:02:56,"Didn't he think he heard a voice saying to him like, right, right, you must write?"
00:02:56,00:02:57,"So he was like, well, this is what I'm going to do."
00:02:57,00:03:01,"And then the fact of whether he was good or not, didn't really come into the equation."
00:03:01,00:03:02,Yeah.
00:03:02,00:03:04,And he really believed in himself as well.
00:03:04,00:03:10,"He once tried to read poetry to Queen Victoria, and he sent them a letter to the palace saying"
00:03:10,00:03:11,I would like to read.
00:03:11,00:03:12,"And they said, no, it's okay."
00:03:12,00:03:13,Thank you very much.
00:03:13,00:03:14,That's fine.
00:03:14,00:03:15,"So he thought, I know what I'll do."
00:03:15,00:03:19,I'll walk all the way from Dundee to Balmoral to perform to Queen Victoria.
00:03:19,00:03:20,He did.
00:03:20,00:03:23,"He arrived at the castle and they said genuinely, no, thank you."
00:03:23,00:03:25,"Yeah, to walk all the way back."
00:03:25,00:03:26,Didn't get to do it.
00:03:26,00:03:29,"Got a few sentry miles or so, that he was."
00:03:29,00:03:30,"Yeah, I'm fit."
00:03:30,00:03:33,"Yeah, he introduced himself as the queen's poet when he got there."
00:03:33,00:03:35,He was a massive fan of Queen Victoria.
00:03:35,00:03:39,"There were loads of assassination attempts on her throughout her life, none of them successful."
00:03:39,00:03:44,"And after one of them, he wrote a poem in tribute to the failed assassination attempt,"
00:03:44,00:03:48,"which kicks off like this, God prospered long on noble queen and long may she reign."
00:03:48,00:03:51,"McLean, he tried to shoot her, but it was all in vain."
00:03:51,00:03:55,"For God, he turned the ball aside, McLean aimed at her head, and he felt very angry because"
00:03:55,00:03:57,he didn't shoot her dead.
00:03:57,00:04:01,"It's quite nice, I should add."
00:04:01,00:04:05,We were reading these on National Poetry Day here in the UK.
00:04:05,00:04:07,"Yeah, celebrating as we were recording."
00:04:07,00:04:12,"He was always being victims of hoaxes that were so sad, but also kind of okay because he"
00:04:12,00:04:14,seemed oblivious to it.
00:04:14,00:04:18,There was the famous hoaxe when a group of students sent him a thing in the post saying
00:04:18,00:04:23,"that he'd won the Order of the Grand Knight of the Holy Order of the White Elephant, which"
00:04:23,00:04:26,was an extremely important Burmese title.
00:04:26,00:04:31,"And it was a title that was given by King Thiebor of Burma for his amazing poetry, and they"
00:04:31,00:04:34,called him William Topaz in that.
00:04:34,00:04:38,"And he, thereafter, made his name William Topaz McGonagall."
00:04:38,00:04:39,You're kidding?
00:04:39,00:04:40,That's not his middle name.
00:04:40,00:04:41,"Yeah, that wasn't his birth name?"
00:04:41,00:04:42,No.
00:04:42,00:04:44,"So, that was the first time ever it seemed to get mentioned."
00:04:44,00:04:47,"I hadn't read that, it was where it was invented, but that was the first time it's mentioned."
00:04:47,00:04:52,"And then he had this award up on his wall forevermore, thinking that the King of Burma had blessed"
00:04:52,00:04:53,him.
00:04:53,00:04:54,It was amazing.
00:04:54,00:04:55,I think as well.
00:04:55,00:04:57,"He had a lot of weird stuff happen, but he did sort of invite some of it."
00:04:57,00:05:01,"There's a story about he paid money to play Macbeth in the performance, or the Scottish"
00:05:01,00:05:02,play.
00:05:02,00:05:07,"And he thought the actor playing Macbeth was upstaging him, so he refused to die."
00:05:07,00:05:09,And just like Harry Donne.
00:05:09,00:05:14,"Apparently, that was before he started doing a poetry, so it was in his first career."
00:05:14,00:05:15,And there was a review of that players.
00:05:15,00:05:19,"I think it's one of the earliest times he appears in any write-up, but there was a reviewer"
00:05:19,00:05:24,"in the channel who eventually wrote that after an extremely long sword fight, where despite"
00:05:24,00:05:28,"being hit multiple times, he's not dying, the reviewer wrote that McDuff resolved the"
00:05:28,00:05:33,matter in a rather undignified way by taking the feet from under the principal character.
00:05:33,00:05:37,So he had to be rugby tackle on stage.
00:05:37,00:05:39,He was almost never paid to write a poem.
00:05:39,00:05:44,"It all came from public readings, but the very few times he was paid was when he wrote"
00:05:44,00:05:46,advert poems for things.
00:05:46,00:05:48,"So beechems, you know, the beechems pills."
00:05:48,00:05:50,"Like a cough, something."
00:05:50,00:05:51,"Yeah, exactly."
00:05:51,00:05:53,"And so when they were launched, they were kind of cural."
00:05:53,00:05:56,"They were meant to cure absolutely everything, but they didn't really have anything in them."
00:05:56,00:05:57,"They had aloe, ginger and soap."
00:05:57,00:05:58,That was what was in them.
00:05:58,00:05:59,So.
00:05:59,00:06:00,Yeah.
00:06:00,00:06:06,"So for a fee, he wrote the following, ""What ho, sickly people of high and low degree?"
00:06:06,00:06:12,"I pray you all be warned by me no matter what may be your bodily ills, the safest and quickest"
00:06:12,00:06:14,"cure is beechems pills."""
00:06:14,00:06:15,It's quite good.
00:06:15,00:06:16,Yeah.
00:06:16,00:06:17,I want some beechems right now.
00:06:17,00:06:18,Yeah.
00:06:18,00:06:19,Just hearing that.
00:06:19,00:06:20,How did that start again?
00:06:20,00:06:22,"What ho, sickly people of high and low degree?"
00:06:22,00:06:26,You frequently did that kind of bang headline at the start of a poem.
00:06:26,00:06:31,"So he went to New York and his poem there starts, ""Oh, mighty city of New York."
00:06:31,00:06:32,You are wonderful to behold.
00:06:32,00:06:35,"Your buildings are magnificent, the truth be it told."
00:06:35,00:06:40,"They were the only things that seemed to arrest my eye, because many of them are 13 stories"
00:06:40,00:06:41,"high."""
00:06:41,00:06:45,"It's so weird, isn't it, because you don't know whether to feel sorry for him or not, because"
00:06:45,00:06:48,he did seem oblivious and he kept on almost asking for it.
00:06:48,00:06:54,"So he'd always dress up in full Scottish regalia with, you know, kilton, spiron and stuff."
00:06:54,00:06:57,"Even on the trip to America, he was dressed like that all the time."
00:06:57,00:07:02,And the thick skinness means that there are some psychologists who agree with the historian
00:07:02,00:07:06,"who first suggested he might have been slightly autistic, partly based on the fact that he"
00:07:06,00:07:13,"seemed immune almost to this constant criticism, and also his obsessive repetition of stuff."
00:07:13,00:07:18,"So over 60 of his poems begin with the word twos, and the phrase ""beautiful to be seen"" is"
00:07:18,00:07:19,in about 50 of them.
00:07:19,00:07:23,"Yeah, really proud of that line, I know."
00:07:23,00:07:24,It's an incredible line.
00:07:24,00:07:25,Shakespeare would have been proud.
00:07:25,00:07:28,"I found this really interesting, and I don't know if this is well known."
00:07:28,00:07:34,"Professor McGonagall is named after William McGonagall, and J.K. Rowling has actually confirmed"
00:07:34,00:07:35,that that is the case.
00:07:35,00:07:39,"Yeah, she said she likes the idea of someone so fabulous being named after someone so absurd."
00:07:39,00:07:44,"Which I thought was, because McGonagall is a, she's a complex character by the standards"
00:07:44,00:07:45,"of Harry Potter, isn't she?"
00:07:45,00:07:46,She's not totally good.
00:07:46,00:07:48,She can be a bit of a strict old cow sometimes.
00:07:48,00:07:52,"Oh, well, that's not me saying that, but we're not."
00:07:52,00:07:54,We're not willing to talk about that.
00:07:54,00:07:57,Classic slither and sentence from Anna there.
00:07:57,00:08:00,"I used to live in Edinburgh, and there's a lot of street names that you recognise from"
00:08:00,00:08:03,"Harry Potter books, and near the statue of Graveyard, as well as a churchyard, and there's a gravestone"
00:08:03,00:08:04,for Tom Riddle.
00:08:04,00:08:05,Really?
00:08:05,00:08:06,"Yeah, you can see the actual."
00:08:06,00:08:07,Yeah.
00:08:07,00:08:11,And what's interesting about that is that is the exact same graveyard where William McGonagall
00:08:11,00:08:13,"was buried, which I've been to, I've visited."
00:08:13,00:08:15,He's saying William McGonagall was Lord Voldemort.
00:08:15,00:08:20,"I've said, I think J.K. Rowling took a quick creative trip to the graveyard and bashed"
00:08:20,00:08:21,out all the names she needed.
00:08:21,00:08:32,"Okay, it is time for fact number two, and that is Andy."
00:08:32,00:08:37,My fact is that one third of all the hazelnuts in the world go into Ferreiro products.
00:08:37,00:08:43,"Yeah, so Ferreiro, Roche, Nutella, things like this."
00:08:43,00:08:44,"Tic Tacs, which they also make."
00:08:44,00:08:46,How many hazelnuts in Tic Tac?
00:08:46,00:08:47,About 75?
00:08:47,00:08:48,Yeah.
00:08:48,00:08:49,About one per Tic Tac.
00:08:49,00:08:56,"So, yeah, this is a piece that was published in Forbes recently, and it was a profile of"
00:08:56,00:09:00,"the company, basically, which is a very well-established family firm, basically."
00:09:00,00:09:05,"It started in the 1930s with one man who had one pastry shop, and it's now become a thing"
00:09:05,00:09:08,that uses a third of all the hazelnuts in the world.
00:09:08,00:09:09,"Yeah, they're a big deal."
00:09:09,00:09:10,They're a big deal.
00:09:10,00:09:11,I was saying.
00:09:11,00:09:15,"And the main owner, he passed away, only four years ago, Michelle Ferreiro."
00:09:15,00:09:20,And his fortune was up to 15 billion.
00:09:20,00:09:23,"His top 50, well, the guy now is top 50 richest people in the world."
00:09:23,00:09:28,"It's massive, but Michelle, people always said, was a very, very humble man, didn't they?"
00:09:28,00:09:33,"So he was the guy who, basically, his dad made the Nutella chocolate, but he made it in"
00:09:33,00:09:37,sort of a loaf that was quite hard and sold it in slices.
00:09:37,00:09:41,"This was in post-war rationing time, and he thought a way of sort of recreating chocolates"
00:09:41,00:09:44,"to add hazelnuts instead, because it's a chocolate shortage."
00:09:44,00:09:48,"Yeah, he sold it in slices, like bread, and he used to give a slice of Nutella away free"
00:09:48,00:09:52,with each loaf of bread as a way of kind of pushing it.
00:09:52,00:09:58,"And then his son, Michelle, added some oil, and then it got all spreadable, and the rest"
00:09:58,00:09:59,is his favorite.
00:09:59,00:10:03,"And it's so confusing, because Nutella was originally sold as pasta."
00:10:03,00:10:04,What?
00:10:04,00:10:05,"Yeah, what?"
00:10:05,00:10:11,"As in its name, it was sold, you bought pasta janduia, and it was a, that's how it was"
00:10:11,00:10:12,sold.
00:10:12,00:10:13,"It's because it's paced, right?"
00:10:13,00:10:14,Yeah.
00:10:14,00:10:15,Yeah.
00:10:15,00:10:16,Yeah.
00:10:16,00:10:17,They don't get it.
00:10:17,00:10:18,So you boil it?
00:10:18,00:10:19,"No, it's exactly as Anna was saying."
00:10:19,00:10:21,"It turns out you see kicking pasta, and then it's a loaf of bread."
00:10:21,00:10:22,I'm so confused.
00:10:22,00:10:23,Yeah.
00:10:23,00:10:26,"Because the Italian pasta is just going to be Italian for paced, right?"
00:10:26,00:10:27,"Wait, so it'll be paced."
00:10:27,00:10:32,"When the Italians say pasta, they don't eat pasta like we do at all in Italy."
00:10:32,00:10:33,What?
00:10:33,00:10:34,It's all spreadable.
00:10:34,00:10:41,Do you know where loads of their factories originally were?
00:10:41,00:10:42,They were old.
00:10:42,00:10:43,They were also factories.
00:10:43,00:10:47,But a lot of the factories they started off with were former Nazi missile factories.
00:10:47,00:10:48,Yeah.
00:10:48,00:10:52,"I guess there were a lot of empty ones, and they were like, ""We'll use the space."""
00:10:52,00:10:53,Yeah.
00:10:53,00:10:54,That's true.
00:10:54,00:10:55,That's true.
00:10:55,00:10:58,The usage rate of Nazi missile factories dropped off dramatically.
00:10:58,00:10:59,Yeah.
00:10:59,00:11:03,"I can't imagine looking at the machinery and thinking, ""I think we can adjust this just"
00:11:03,00:11:06,"a little bit and make chocolates out of it."""
00:11:06,00:11:07,No.
00:11:07,00:11:10,"Also, it's amazing how Nutella's managed to shake off the reputation, isn't it?"
00:11:10,00:11:15,"Just like Volkswagen, they're both born of Nazism, and yet somehow it's fine to possess"
00:11:15,00:11:16,them both.
00:11:16,00:11:17,Are they?
00:11:17,00:11:18,"They wasn't made by Nazism, Nutella."
00:11:18,00:11:21,"Well, it's got the associations, hasn't it?"
00:11:21,00:11:22,What's the association?
00:11:22,00:11:23,The factories?
00:11:23,00:11:24,Nutella.
00:11:24,00:11:25,But that's post-war.
00:11:25,00:11:26,That's post-war factories.
00:11:26,00:11:29,"I'm not actually suggesting a boycott Nutella, because I think I'll lose one of my food"
00:11:29,00:11:32,grips if we do.
00:11:32,00:11:35,"Well, they kind of is a link, I'm afraid, to Italian fascism."
00:11:35,00:11:40,"So Pietro, who's the guy who founded the company, in 1938, he moved to East Africa"
00:11:40,00:11:44,trying to sell biscuits to Mussolini's troops who were stationed there.
00:11:44,00:11:45,"Oh, did he?"
00:11:45,00:11:48,"So there's a little bit of a link, but not a full-on link, obviously."
00:11:48,00:11:52,"Yeah, as I'll say in Trenton Nutella, isn't there using hazelnuts?"
00:11:52,00:11:55,"Was because of the rationing from the war, so it came out of the consequences rather"
00:11:55,00:11:56,than because of the ideologies?
00:11:56,00:11:57,Yes.
00:11:57,00:11:58,Yes.
00:11:58,00:11:59,Fascists didn't make Nutella.
00:11:59,00:12:00,I've never claimed that.
00:12:00,00:12:01,"Nutella, please, don't sue me."
00:12:01,00:12:02,So hazelnuts?
00:12:02,00:12:03,Mm-hmm.
00:12:03,00:12:04,Yeah.
00:12:04,00:12:08,Three quarters of the world's hazelnuts come from Turkey.
00:12:08,00:12:09,Yeah.
00:12:09,00:12:11,"I don't know, is there absolutely a corner of the market?"
00:12:11,00:12:16,"And a quarter of the world's hazelnuts, so one third of those produced in Turkey, itself"
00:12:16,00:12:20,"three quarters of the total, a quarter of the world's hazelnuts are produced in a single"
00:12:20,00:12:21,Turkish town.
00:12:21,00:12:22,Yeah.
00:12:22,00:12:23,He's on uptown.
00:12:23,00:12:27,"And they had a terrible frost in 2014, and a third of the harvest was wiped out and prices"
00:12:27,00:12:28,rose by 60%.
00:12:28,00:12:30,"Yeah, this is all doable, isn't it?"
00:12:30,00:12:31,"Yeah, all doable."
00:12:31,00:12:32,Exactly.
00:12:32,00:12:34,"I mean, obviously, it's in the fields around the town."
00:12:34,00:12:35,It's not exclusively in the town.
00:12:35,00:12:39,"But Nutella is trying to smash the cornering of the market, yeah, because they want"
00:12:39,00:12:44,"a bit of variety in case there's another frost, so they're moving into Georgia and Abkhazia,"
00:12:44,00:12:49,"another traditionally very calm and politically easygoing region, which won't be."
00:12:49,00:12:52,"So they pray to a lot of local politics, basically."
00:12:52,00:12:53,Yeah.
00:12:53,00:12:57,"But every year, they have half a million tons of hazelnut shells to get rid of."
00:12:57,00:12:59,What do they do with them?
00:12:59,00:13:00,They sell them for cheap heating fuel.
00:13:00,00:13:01,"Oh, cool."
00:13:01,00:13:04,And I can't remember what else they do.
00:13:04,00:13:06,"Well, here's one thing that the Ferreiro people do."
00:13:06,00:13:10,"They use the hazelnut shells, and they've been testing, and I don't know if this has been"
00:13:10,00:13:11,put into practice.
00:13:11,00:13:12,This was a few years ago.
00:13:12,00:13:17,"They've been making it into the wrapping that we have for, yeah, so they've reintegrated"
00:13:17,00:13:21,it into the packaging to make themselves totally resourceful of all the--
00:13:21,00:13:22,The Nutella.
00:13:22,00:13:23,"No, for Ferreiro."
00:13:23,00:13:24,That's the gold stuff.
00:13:24,00:13:27,This is from the project coordinator at Ferreiro.
00:13:27,00:13:32,"We have access to large amounts of residual byproducts, which we realize could be used constructively."
00:13:32,00:13:37,So the company's idea was to use the nuts to create the packaging for the chocolates.
00:13:37,00:13:42,"Hey, if you ever want to know what to call a specific bit of a Ferreirochet, I have the"
00:13:42,00:13:43,answer.
00:13:43,00:13:44,Wow.
00:13:44,00:13:46,"So I was reading about how it goes through the factory, and you know, it's got all these amazing"
00:13:46,00:13:51,"devices that, for instance, sense if it's misshapen and automatically puff a bit of air"
00:13:51,00:13:55,"to knock it off the production line, and all that funky stuff."
00:13:55,00:14:00,"And then there's a moment where all of Ferreirochet is, is this wafer ball, that rounded wafer,"
00:14:00,00:14:06,"which, by the way, took him, Ferreiro, five years, the story goes, to try and hone how to make"
00:14:06,00:14:10,"a wafer curl, apparently he was in his factory on his own for five years, that's as a legend"
00:14:10,00:14:11,goes.
00:14:11,00:14:12,I like the person with that.
00:14:12,00:14:15,"But he curls the wafer, and then they're in the factory, and they've got hazelnut in"
00:14:15,00:14:16,"them, and Nutella spread."
00:14:16,00:14:20,"And before they're dipped in chocolate and hazelnuts, that little ball is called a pickpock."
00:14:20,00:14:21,Wow.
00:14:21,00:14:22,Just in case--
00:14:22,00:14:25,"So if you ever suck the chocolate off the outside of a Ferreirochet, you can say, ""I've got"
00:14:25,00:14:26,"a pickpock."""
00:14:26,00:14:27,So they've got tick-tax pickpocks.
00:14:27,00:14:31,"That's very good naming, they should market that."
00:14:31,00:14:33,I don't want to eat one that someone else has taken the chocolate off.
00:14:33,00:14:34,I know.
00:14:34,00:14:35,Sure.
00:14:35,00:14:41,I was reading a bit about the fact that this family that created the whole Ferreiro
00:14:41,00:14:45,"empire are incredibly secretive, we were saying humble before, but it was also incredibly"
00:14:45,00:14:46,secretive.
00:14:46,00:14:49,"No one knew virtually anything about them, and for a company that was so massive, they"
00:14:49,00:14:53,never did any real publicity of their own.
00:14:53,00:14:56,"Their website, it was spotted in the telegraph back in 2009."
00:14:56,00:15:02,"This is since changed, so possibly since the owner Michelle had died, but they only had one"
00:15:02,00:15:07,"financial press release on their website up until 2009, and it was two sentences long, and"
00:15:07,00:15:09,that's the only thing they ever had.
00:15:09,00:15:13,"Yeah, he gave one interview Michelle in his whole career, and even when he gave that interview,"
00:15:13,00:15:16,"which was right towards the end of it, before he died, he wore dark glasses the whole way"
00:15:16,00:15:17,through.
00:15:17,00:15:18,Yeah.
00:15:18,00:15:19,I think it wasn't actually him.
00:15:19,00:15:20,"Yeah, you're right."
00:15:20,00:15:21,He blatantly said that.
00:15:21,00:15:22,He said your media savvy.
00:15:22,00:15:23,Yeah.
00:15:23,00:15:24,A media savvy umpulumpa from the factory.
00:15:24,00:15:25,Oh wow.
00:15:25,00:15:26,It's still his brother who's in charge.
00:15:26,00:15:27,It's not Giovanni.
00:15:27,00:15:28,Hmm.
00:15:28,00:15:29,Yeah.
00:15:29,00:15:32,"They're basically like real life Willy Wonka, so without the killing off with children."
00:15:32,00:15:33,That's true.
00:15:33,00:15:34,"Not killing, but like..."
00:15:34,00:15:35,It's far away.
00:15:35,00:15:39,"Well, someone else has joined the sweepstake to get sued by Nutella."
00:15:39,00:15:42,I don't think the role dollar state has just come into.
00:15:42,00:15:44,You're going to be sued by Harry Potter.
00:15:44,00:15:45,"Well, why?"
00:15:45,00:15:46,I was...
00:15:46,00:15:47,"No, that was Anna again."
00:15:47,00:15:48,It's all me.
00:15:48,00:15:49,Because of the graveyard.
00:15:49,00:15:50,No.
00:15:50,00:15:51,That's real.
00:15:51,00:15:52,"And Willy McGonagall's buried there, and there is a Thomas Riddle."
00:15:52,00:15:53,"Oh, yeah."
00:15:53,00:15:56,He did claim JK Rowling has no imagination.
00:15:56,00:15:59,"She just called this around graveyards like a creep, stealing her ideas off the gravestones."
00:15:59,00:16:02,JK Rowling is the greatest writer that our world has ever known.
00:16:02,00:16:03,"It's too late now, though."
00:16:03,00:16:04,"Oh, man."
00:16:04,00:16:05,We've said the words.
00:16:05,00:16:08,"Um, I found out something about Shakespeare's Globe, because Shakespeare's Globe was partly"
00:16:08,00:16:09,built on Hazelnut shells.
00:16:09,00:16:10,What?
00:16:10,00:16:11,Wow.
00:16:11,00:16:15,So they were excavating the original one before it was rebuilt.
00:16:15,00:16:19,"And what they found, a layer of hazelnut shells, and they assumed that maybe this is the"
00:16:19,00:16:22,"leftovers from people snacking on them, but it turns out that that wasn't the case"
00:16:22,00:16:28,"because they were an ingredient in a kind of mortar, what was called a poor man's mortar."
00:16:28,00:16:32,"So it was mixed with cinders and ash, and it let the rainwater filter through about support"
00:16:32,00:16:33,of the building.
00:16:33,00:16:38,"So when they rebuilt the theatre, the theatre sourced seven and a half tons of hazelnut"
00:16:38,00:16:45,"shells from Turkey, sort of a special military plane flew them over, and they were pounded"
00:16:45,00:16:47,into a mortar and they were put under the floor.
00:16:47,00:16:49,So the Globe today is still on Hazelnut shells.
00:16:49,00:16:50,That's extraordinary.
00:16:50,00:16:51,That's cool.
00:16:51,00:16:52,That is so cool.
00:16:52,00:16:57,"Sometimes need a button, like an alarm for like best facts of the podcast, that is cool."
00:16:57,00:16:59,"Okay, we've hit best facts."
00:16:59,00:17:04,"They used to be called hazelnuts, until really recently, they used to be called filbits."
00:17:04,00:17:05,"Now, have you guys ever called them filbits?"
00:17:05,00:17:06,No.
00:17:06,00:17:10,"Because I was just reading an ask in the Atlantic, which happened to be from 1996, and someone"
00:17:10,00:17:14,"said the filbert, or as people seem to be calling it these days, they hazelnut shells."
00:17:14,00:17:15,You find them nonsense.
00:17:15,00:17:16,Isn't that weird?
00:17:16,00:17:17,"Oh, that's nice."
00:17:17,00:17:18,I'm simply saying it back.
00:17:18,00:17:19,Should we move on?
00:17:19,00:17:20,"Yeah, yeah."
00:17:20,00:17:21,"Oh, can I just mention that?"
00:17:21,00:17:23,"Oh, can I just mention Nutella jars."
00:17:23,00:17:26,"In 2015, one caused a fire."
00:17:26,00:17:31,"This was in Twickenham, and Sunrays refracted from an empty Nutella jar that was left on a window"
00:17:31,00:17:34,"sill, and it burned an entire house down and killed a pet dog."
00:17:34,00:17:37,So don't leave your Nutella jars out.
00:17:37,00:17:38,And don't sue us Nutella.
00:17:38,00:17:39,What?
00:17:39,00:17:41,"Hannah, you absolutely gone for it."
00:17:41,00:17:42,They're Nazis.
00:17:42,00:17:46,They'll burn your house down.
00:17:46,00:17:56,"OK, it is time for fact number three, and that is Chazinski."
00:17:56,00:18:02,My fact is that the earliest depicted sofas were five feet high off the ground.
00:18:02,00:18:08,"There's this great article in the Paris Review, which is a review of a book called Now I Sit Me Down"
00:18:08,00:18:12,"by a guy called Wittold Ribzinski, and I really want to read it."
00:18:12,00:18:20,"And in that, he mentions this couch, which appears in an alabaster carving from the seventh century"
00:18:20,00:18:26,"called The Garden Party, and it's from Assyria, and it shows a king reclining on a sofa and"
00:18:26,00:18:27,it's five feet high.
00:18:27,00:18:31,And he's got its queen slightly below him on an also quite high chair that has a footstool
00:18:31,00:18:33,to mount it.
00:18:33,00:18:38,"And so, yeah, the earliest sofas were like that, and this was in Nineveh and 645 BC."
00:18:38,00:18:43,"And the height of your furniture, apparently, was related to where your social standing was."
00:18:43,00:18:47,"Do you know that the French word for sofa is canape, so if you're in France and someone"
00:18:47,00:18:50,"offers you a canape, they're offering you a sofa."
00:18:50,00:18:51,Really?
00:18:51,00:18:54,They're much more generous at their dinner party.
00:18:54,00:18:56,They gave out so many canapes.
00:18:56,00:18:58,"Yeah, it's because it's a sofa for the thing to go on, isn't it?"
00:18:58,00:19:01,We call it that because it's like a couch for the food to sit on.
00:19:01,00:19:02,What?
00:19:02,00:19:03,"Yeah, the food relaxes."
00:19:03,00:19:04,The food to sit on.
00:19:04,00:19:08,"Traditionally, it's stale bread, it's supposed to be an canape, and so the stale bread acts"
00:19:08,00:19:13,"as a sofa, and then you plonk your salmon on top of it, and that's a canape."
00:19:13,00:19:14,That's great.
00:19:14,00:19:15,I didn't know that.
00:19:15,00:19:17,You may have lost your best fat to the podcast.
00:19:17,00:19:18,Yeah.
00:19:18,00:19:22,"Do you know that in the '50s, there was a trend for cardboard sofas?"
00:19:22,00:19:23,What?
00:19:23,00:19:24,What?
00:19:24,00:19:28,"Yeah, there was an article in popular mechanics in 1954, it was that they called the trend"
00:19:28,00:19:32,"paperboard furniture, and they were very excited about it because you could use pulp"
00:19:32,00:19:35,"and waste paper, and so it could be recycled, or you could find it in different ways, very"
00:19:35,00:19:39,"lightweight, and I quote, ""The furniture is relatively inexpensive, extremely strong and"
00:19:39,00:19:41,"durable, and can be disassembled when you move."
00:19:41,00:19:44,Newlyweds can use it to bridge the gap until they can afford the kind of furniture they
00:19:44,00:19:45,"want for life."""
00:19:45,00:19:51,"It's basically rather than send you a box of stuff in it, just take the box."
00:19:51,00:19:56,"Sofas are one of the reasons why Romans did away with cutlery for a while, so that reclining"
00:19:56,00:20:00,"on couches became really popular and was brought from the Arabic world, the Middle East,"
00:20:00,00:20:06,"where this original fact was from, into Europe, and the word sofa comes from an Arabic word,"
00:20:06,00:20:10,"so the Romans started doing it, and then you're using one hand to lean on, you know, you're"
00:20:10,00:20:14,"propped up on one elbow, and so you can only eat with one hand, and so you can't be having"
00:20:14,00:20:16,cutlery because it gets right in the way.
00:20:16,00:20:19,"It just looks so uncomfortable, the Roman way of dining, where you're lying on your side"
00:20:19,00:20:23,on a couch with a table with food on it next to you.
00:20:23,00:20:24,It just looks mad.
00:20:24,00:20:25,Yeah.
00:20:25,00:20:27,"And it takes up so much space, because everyone's lying down."
00:20:27,00:20:28,Yeah.
00:20:28,00:20:31,The theory is that that's how the last supper happened.
00:20:31,00:20:36,"Everyone was lying on their sides in a kind of u-shape, so you'd have about four people"
00:20:36,00:20:42,"per side, each side of the u, but it does mean that you're facing someone's back, the third"
00:20:42,00:20:46,"line, in front of you, facing away from you, and the guy behind you is facing your back"
00:20:46,00:20:47,and trying to talk to you.
00:20:47,00:20:51,"And you've got someone's foot in your face, but I was just thinking, you'd want to make"
00:20:51,00:20:55,"sure you're on the right part of the room, because there's a thing about if you go to"
00:20:55,00:20:58,"sleep on your left side, you look like you get indigestion, because you're a food engineer"
00:20:58,00:21:04,"self-aggressive, because that way, so if you lie on your right, there's one way that you"
00:21:04,00:21:08,"lie, you can get indigestion, because the food can't go in easy, and one way that's easier."
00:21:08,00:21:11,"So if you're lying on the wrong side in the room, I mean, lying down still not great, but"
00:21:11,00:21:13,maybe it would be slightly more comfortable.
00:21:13,00:21:17,"I think I'd risk indigestion just to have a conversation with a human, rather than"
00:21:17,00:21:18,it.
00:21:18,00:21:19,Maybe.
00:21:19,00:21:20,You roll it in a circle.
00:21:20,00:21:21,But maybe it was all viral.
00:21:21,00:21:24,"They all turn it to lie the same way, often in those paintings, so maybe they'd"
00:21:24,00:21:25,crack this indigestion thing.
00:21:25,00:21:26,They were like turning around you.
00:21:26,00:21:27,Yeah.
00:21:27,00:21:28,That's really amazing.
00:21:28,00:21:29,I didn't know that.
00:21:29,00:21:33,"So the furniture generally is quite recent, almost all the furniture we see today, there"
00:21:33,00:21:37,was an article in the New York Times that was saying pretty much everything you see was invented
00:21:37,00:21:40,between 1670 and 1730.
00:21:40,00:21:44,"So once sofas came about, like a lot of things, after ancient Roman ancient Greece and everything"
00:21:44,00:21:51,"fell, they just disappeared, didn't come back for ages, and things like armchairs or sofas"
00:21:51,00:21:55,"or basically everything except just one table where you do everything, and then your bed"
00:21:55,00:21:57,just wasn't a thing.
00:21:57,00:22:01,"And along with it, apparently came the new sofa attitude, which was when women started"
00:22:01,00:22:06,"being a bit sexier and more relaxed, because the sofa encourages you to slightly drape"
00:22:06,00:22:08,yourself over it.
00:22:08,00:22:13,"So there's a theory that that kind of loosened up women's behaviour and morals, I think."
00:22:13,00:22:14,Wow.
00:22:14,00:22:18,"So suddenly, men around the world were going, ""Hey, there's some sexy ladies, all of us"
00:22:18,00:22:19,"started."""
00:22:19,00:22:21,That's when the population started to really rise.
00:22:21,00:22:22,Yeah.
00:22:22,00:22:23,Wow.
00:22:23,00:22:27,"I did find out about the first man to make a chair factory, because before this guy, he"
00:22:27,00:22:33,"was called Michael Thonne, he was a Frenchman, all chairs were lovingly handcrafted and made."
00:22:33,00:22:38,"He was born in 1796, and in Vienna, 40 or 50 years later, in mid 19th century, lots and"
00:22:38,00:22:44,"lots of restaurants and cafes and coffee houses are opening, and they need chairs, they need"
00:22:44,00:22:47,"hundreds and hundreds and thousands and thousands of chairs, and it's too much effort"
00:22:47,00:22:51,for individual craftsmen that laboriously carve chairs.
00:22:51,00:22:56,"So he had this brilliant method where he would cut wood into strips, he'd boil bundles"
00:22:56,00:23:01,"of them in glue, and then he'd bend them into the shape in a mold that he wanted them"
00:23:01,00:23:02,to be.
00:23:02,00:23:06,"So it's more effective way of doing it, and then he'd develop ways of bending whole wood,"
00:23:06,00:23:09,"you know, whole pieces of wood."
00:23:09,00:23:13,"So it was bending rather than jamming together, which is obviously much less labour intensive."
00:23:13,00:23:16,"Yeah, and then Demand grew so high that he had to open five factories by the time he"
00:23:16,00:23:17,died.
00:23:17,00:23:21,"So he was a huge share pie in there, thousands of thousands, it's weird to think of the"
00:23:21,00:23:24,"first ever jazz factory, Michael Thonne."
00:23:24,00:23:25,Michael Thonne.
00:23:25,00:23:26,Yeah.
00:23:26,00:23:30,"Then on the very opposite mass produced, you know, when Kim Kardashian and Kanye West got"
00:23:30,00:23:34,"married, they had for their meal, they had a massive custom made marble table, and instead"
00:23:34,00:23:37,"of place card, they had everyone's names engraved in the marble table."
00:23:37,00:23:42,"But they got married, and it's late, I don't know, he's transport that back to California."
00:23:42,00:23:43,"Oh, wow."
00:23:43,00:23:45,Imagine having a last minute seat as if they changed.
00:23:45,00:23:46,Yeah.
00:23:46,00:23:47,We've actually fallen out.
00:23:47,00:23:48,Can we sit apart?
00:23:48,00:23:49,No.
00:23:49,00:23:50,Yeah.
00:23:50,00:23:51,"Unfortunately, you're a...oh my goodness."
00:23:51,00:23:52,It's literally set in stone.
00:23:52,00:23:53,No.
00:23:53,00:24:06,"Okay, it's time for our final fact of the show, and that is Anne."
00:24:06,00:24:10,My fact is that the first adverb to be shown on channel five was first and now number five.
00:24:10,00:24:11,So good.
00:24:11,00:24:12,Lovely.
00:24:12,00:24:13,So nice.
00:24:13,00:24:14,Very pleasing.
00:24:14,00:24:23,"So, it launched on 30th March, 1997, the Spice Girls launched channel five, where they sang"
00:24:23,00:24:26,"the song five, four, three, two, one, but turned into one, two, three, four, five."
00:24:26,00:24:27,Yeah.
00:24:27,00:24:28,It was a night of wild entertainment.
00:24:28,00:24:31,"I watched it this morning, because I've never seen it before."
00:24:31,00:24:33,It was the full launch night.
00:24:33,00:24:34,Do you remember it?
00:24:34,00:24:35,Do you remember it?
00:24:35,00:24:36,Yeah.
00:24:36,00:24:39,I remember very excitingly people turning up to re-jig the TV.
00:24:39,00:24:40,Yeah.
00:24:40,00:24:41,Because they were only four channels then.
00:24:41,00:24:42,So it's like we were getting 20% more.
00:24:42,00:24:43,Yeah.
00:24:43,00:24:44,Yeah.
00:24:44,00:24:46,I was wondering about what brilliant programmes some five would hold.
00:24:46,00:24:47,Little did we know.
00:24:47,00:24:51,"Why, forgotten though, was that half an hour of the launch night was just showing trailers"
00:24:51,00:24:52,for shows that were coming soon.
00:24:52,00:24:53,Yes.
00:24:53,00:24:54,I think was it.
00:24:54,00:24:55,Yeah.
00:24:55,00:24:56,Clever.
00:24:56,00:25:01,"The first ever adverb that was put onto TV was in the 50s, and it was ITV's launch night."
00:25:01,00:25:06,"It was the first time it went on, and it was an adverb for toothpaste, Gibbs SR toothpaste."
00:25:06,00:25:10,"And it's quite cool, because, you know, first TV adverb, and already they were employing"
00:25:10,00:25:13,a lot of the tricks that are used in modern day adverts.
00:25:13,00:25:18,"So the toothbrush itself was in a big block of ice, and obviously you can't use a big block"
00:25:18,00:25:21,"of ice on a set, you know, it'll melt too quickly."
00:25:21,00:25:22,So it was made out of plastic.
00:25:22,00:25:25,So immediately they were using fake props to be the actual thing.
00:25:25,00:25:26,"Yeah, it's quite cool."
00:25:26,00:25:27,"But yeah, so that was 16."
00:25:27,00:25:30,"And that was the first in the UK, wasn't it, because there was advertising."
00:25:30,00:25:31,Exactly.
00:25:31,00:25:32,"It was the first in the UK, yeah."
00:25:32,00:25:36,I read a really strange thing about advertising now in the future of it.
00:25:36,00:25:40,"So did you know that with old sitcoms and old, but like relatively finished sitcoms,"
00:25:40,00:25:44,"like however I met your mother, what they're doing now is they're still selling advertising"
00:25:44,00:25:47,"spots, because they're going in, they're digitally altering the shows for products that came"
00:25:47,00:25:49,out after the show's finish.
00:25:49,00:25:50,"Oh, yeah."
00:25:50,00:25:51,"So, gee."
00:25:51,00:25:52,So like for a film.
00:25:52,00:25:54,So like for a kind of a new software.
00:25:54,00:25:58,"Yeah, well the example was about a movie that come out a few years after the episodes."
00:25:58,00:26:02,"They changed, I think, a TV screen and a coffee shop, and they've been a lamp post in one"
00:26:02,00:26:03,scene.
00:26:03,00:26:04,They put a poster for the film on the lamp post.
00:26:04,00:26:07,So they're selling this like digital space in shows.
00:26:07,00:26:09,It was just called me so many questions.
00:26:09,00:26:10,Yeah.
00:26:10,00:26:11,How is this?
00:26:11,00:26:12,I didn't know this film was coming out.
00:26:12,00:26:14,That's such a fun idea of updating there.
00:26:14,00:26:19,"Like the way that Anna just went, oh, um, gee, if like in 40 years time someone's listening"
00:26:19,00:26:26,"to this and we digitally insert whatever the, you know, PTD, you know, what she's going"
00:26:26,00:26:27,to stand for.
00:26:27,00:26:28,What exactly?
00:26:28,00:26:29,"Uh, prime time."
00:26:29,00:26:30,Time.
00:26:30,00:26:31,Time.
00:26:31,00:26:32,Time dude.
00:26:32,00:26:33,Time dude.
00:26:33,00:26:34,Time dude.
00:26:34,00:26:37,"If we're saying that, that is not a world I want to live in."
00:26:37,00:26:41,"I read a thing about the first adverts ever, but this wasn't Wikipedia and I haven't been"
00:26:41,00:26:45,"able to back it up independently, but it's that the earliest adverts were in China and that"
00:26:45,00:26:47,they were oral.
00:26:47,00:26:51,So you would get bamboo flutes played to sell confectionery.
00:26:51,00:26:55,"I think the first advertising was sort of going around playing a flute and saying, hey,"
00:26:55,00:26:56,do you want to buy some sweets?
00:26:56,00:26:59,"Oh, so you would, you would create a, a jingle on your flute?"
00:26:59,00:27:01,"I think so, but I'm not sure."
00:27:01,00:27:04,"I think in the UK there was a version where they would, um, like early, like sort of"
00:27:04,00:27:08,flowering they would hand out leaflets and it would have the sheet music so you could sing
00:27:08,00:27:09,the jingle to yourself.
00:27:09,00:27:12,"You could take it home and be like, that's right."
00:27:12,00:27:13,That's very fun.
00:27:13,00:27:14,So weird.
00:27:14,00:27:15,She's so funny.
00:27:15,00:27:17,So much less appealing.
00:27:17,00:27:21,"The idea of something being advertised by your dad, kind of badly, kind of interpret sheet"
00:27:21,00:27:22,music.
00:27:22,00:27:26,"I reckon we can set that up, um, William McGonagall beach of music."
00:27:26,00:27:27,Yes.
00:27:27,00:27:28,Yes.
00:27:28,00:27:29,You're right.
00:27:29,00:27:31,"If it had been handed out with a flyer, people loved it."
00:27:31,00:27:32,Yeah.
00:27:32,00:27:34,There's no what the cheese pull is.
00:27:34,00:27:35,The cheese pull.
00:27:35,00:27:36,The cheese pull.
00:27:36,00:27:37,An advertising term.
00:27:37,00:27:38,Okay.
00:27:38,00:27:41,"Uh, and it guesses, um, cheese pull."
00:27:41,00:27:47,"I feel like a thing of cheese sounds like a bayou ball on a string, um, close-ish."
00:27:47,00:27:53,"I think it's an advert that offers you something exciting, like a cheese, but then it pulls it away."
00:27:53,00:27:57,So it leaves you curious and it leaves you to go and find out more about the products.
00:27:57,00:27:58,These are brilliant guesses.
00:27:58,00:27:59,None of them are even close.
00:27:59,00:28:04,"You know, in pizza adverts, when, um, the pizza slice gets pulled away from the pizza, every"
00:28:04,00:28:09,"pizza ad, the cheese pulls away and that's the cheese pull and all adverts like perfume or"
00:28:09,00:28:10,pizza have it.
00:28:10,00:28:12,Adverts that are trying to advertise something.
00:28:12,00:28:16,"I've never seen a perfume advert, but it's a big, slightly pulled apart."
00:28:16,00:28:20,"Guys, it's, it's become a metaphor for a broader advertising technique, uh, which is"
00:28:20,00:28:25,"basically using an image that specifically really, really triggers your different senses"
00:28:25,00:28:26,that aren't sight.
00:28:26,00:28:30,"In my visual suggestion, you see that cheese, but it triggers your sense of taste."
00:28:30,00:28:32,"So, and I watched a lot for this research."
00:28:32,00:28:33,You desperately want pizza.
00:28:33,00:28:36,"There's a way thing with perfume that you're, you're advertising something that you can't"
00:28:36,00:28:37,show because it's a smell.
00:28:37,00:28:38,Exactly.
00:28:38,00:28:40,"So you can't be like, oh, look how great it looks."
00:28:40,00:28:44,"I guess it's about why you have complicated bottles, but you want to sort of give the vibe"
00:28:44,00:28:45,of what you're selling.
00:28:45,00:28:46,Yeah.
00:28:46,00:28:47,It's rather than the actual product.
00:28:47,00:28:48,That's why you need the cheese pull.
00:28:48,00:28:49,Wow.
00:28:49,00:28:50,Because you can't actually show a smell.
00:28:50,00:28:52,"Um, I found another thing about perfume."
00:28:52,00:28:57,"In 2014, a Californian firm announced that they were making perfume for cows."
00:28:57,00:28:58,Okay.
00:28:58,00:28:59,Good.
00:28:59,00:29:00,Good.
00:29:00,00:29:04,"But for human benefit, so the idea was to make cows smell like humans."
00:29:04,00:29:05,No.
00:29:05,00:29:06,Yes.
00:29:06,00:29:09,So mosquitoes would bite the cows instead of biting people.
00:29:09,00:29:11,It's definitely going to be unintended consequences.
00:29:11,00:29:12,That's so bad.
00:29:12,00:29:13,That's so bad.
00:29:13,00:29:22,"Um, I was reading that Benjamin Franklin wanted, wants to invent a perfume."
00:29:22,00:29:27,And it was an anus perfume as in what if we turned our farts into perfume?
00:29:27,00:29:28,What if?
00:29:28,00:29:29,Well captured them.
00:29:29,00:29:30,No.
00:29:30,00:29:31,No.
00:29:31,00:29:32,Yeah.
00:29:32,00:29:33,Although that is something that people used to do.
00:29:33,00:29:38,But what he wanted was for scientists to focus on creating some kind of medicine that you
00:29:38,00:29:42,would take that would mix with the gases that were down there.
00:29:42,00:29:46,"So that when you did fart, it would come out with Chanel number five."
00:29:46,00:29:47,Yes.
00:29:47,00:29:48,Did he have a suggestion?
00:29:48,00:29:49,And what did he?
00:29:49,00:29:50,No.
00:29:50,00:29:51,He was asking for scientists to look into it.
00:29:51,00:29:52,"It was, but that was his idea."
00:29:52,00:29:54,We can all ask for scientists to look into stuff.
00:29:54,00:29:56,"Yeah, but not all of us in Benjamin Franklin."
00:29:56,00:29:57,In Venice too.
00:29:57,00:30:00,"Can I just say one thing, which I don't think we've ever mentioned."
00:30:00,00:30:02,So the Egyptians were really into perfume.
00:30:02,00:30:06,"You know, we're always finding it in the tombs when we excavate them."
00:30:06,00:30:11,And they thought that it was like the sweat of the gods and staff.
00:30:11,00:30:16,"So Moe was the sweat of the god Ra and then her ben oil, the different perfume was squeezed"
00:30:16,00:30:17,from the eye of Horus.
00:30:17,00:30:21,But one thing they used to do was wear perfume cones on their heads.
00:30:21,00:30:23,And that's you see it in a lot of Egyptian art.
00:30:23,00:30:24,Cones.
00:30:24,00:30:25,"Yeah, it's like a black seed cone."
00:30:25,00:30:26,Like an inverted cone.
00:30:26,00:30:27,Party hat.
00:30:27,00:30:28,Cones.
00:30:28,00:30:29,It's like a party hat.
00:30:29,00:30:30,But what it was is a wax cone.
00:30:30,00:30:33,And then I had perfume on the inside and you'd go to a banquet.
00:30:33,00:30:37,"And because it was quite hot in Egypt, it would melt as the banquet proceeded and release"
00:30:37,00:30:44,"the perfume sense into the air, presumably as wax kind of rolled down your face."
00:30:44,00:30:45,And then like dried.
00:30:45,00:30:46,Yes.
00:30:46,00:30:47,Like in your hair.
00:30:47,00:30:48,Tried and concealed in your hair.
00:30:48,00:30:52,It's like why spray it on yourself when you can bring the bottle with you.
00:30:52,00:30:53,All the perfume.
00:30:53,00:30:54,You are.
00:30:54,00:30:55,Feel the perfume.
00:30:55,00:30:56,Be the perfume.
00:30:56,00:30:57,You are the perfume.
00:30:57,00:31:00,I've got a couple of Chanel facts.
00:31:00,00:31:01,Yeah.
00:31:01,00:31:04,"So Coco Chanel, I didn't know this, wasn't called Coco or Chanel in her birth certificate."
00:31:04,00:31:05,Really?
00:31:05,00:31:06,Yeah.
00:31:06,00:31:07,So her first thing is Gabrielle.
00:31:07,00:31:08,Coco was a nickname.
00:31:08,00:31:09,And her surname is Chanel.
00:31:09,00:31:10,But it was originally spot with an S before the end.
00:31:10,00:31:11,So Chasnell.
00:31:11,00:31:12,Chasnell?
00:31:12,00:31:13,Chasnell.
00:31:13,00:31:14,It's got a different ring to it.
00:31:14,00:31:15,That's it.
00:31:15,00:31:16,That's it.
00:31:16,00:31:17,That's Chasnell.
00:31:17,00:31:18,"Chasnell, number five."
00:31:18,00:31:22,Chasnell from Wolverhampton.
00:31:22,00:31:27,"And then it takes, so for a 30-millimeter bottle of the perfume, it takes a thousand jasmine"
00:31:27,00:31:31,"flowers and twelve roses, which is a lot, into one wee bottle."
00:31:31,00:31:32,And I liked a lot.
00:31:32,00:31:35,"If you shop it shut out often enough, you get your own custom mannequin made to your"
00:31:35,00:31:36,exact proportions.
00:31:36,00:31:37,I can make you clothes.
00:31:37,00:31:38,No way.
00:31:38,00:31:40,And I can't have much money you need to spend before you're at mannequin level.
00:31:40,00:31:44,I thought you meant that they made you a custom mannequin so that they can practice spraying
00:31:44,00:31:45,the perfume on you.
00:31:45,00:31:50,So they measure the dimensions of your neck to make sure that it's right for you.
00:31:50,00:31:51,So as a design house.
00:31:51,00:31:52,Sorry.
00:31:52,00:31:53,They have the mannequin.
00:31:53,00:31:54,Wow.
00:31:54,00:31:55,They make other things.
00:31:55,00:31:56,I think the perfume is kind of a one-size-fits-all.
00:31:56,00:31:57,Yes.
00:31:57,00:31:58,I think the perfume is kind of a one-size-fits-all.
00:31:58,00:31:59,The jasmine.
00:31:59,00:32:00,The jasmine.
00:32:00,00:32:01,The jasmine.
00:32:01,00:32:02,"We'll have an XL, please."
00:32:02,00:32:03,A lot.
00:32:03,00:32:04,A lot.
00:32:04,00:32:05,A lot of cows to cover in it.
00:32:05,00:32:06,No.
00:32:06,00:32:12,"I was reading about the making of Chanel number five, its origins."
00:32:12,00:32:17,So it was this guy who created fragrances called Ernest Bow.
00:32:17,00:32:24,"And when he was presenting his sense to Coco Chanel, he had numerous sense that he wanted"
00:32:24,00:32:25,to show her.
00:32:25,00:32:27,And he numbered them number one to number five.
00:32:27,00:32:30,"And then there was a second batch, which was number 20 to 24."
00:32:30,00:32:34,And she went through and she picked number five because that was the best one.
00:32:34,00:32:37,It happened to batch of 6 to 19 because that's what I wanted.
00:32:37,00:32:38,"Yeah, exactly."
00:32:38,00:32:41,And he never used to smell when he was creating the perfumes.
00:32:41,00:32:43,He did it all basically like a mathematical formula.
00:32:43,00:32:44,"Oh, really?"
00:32:44,00:32:49,He knew the smells and he knew the combinations so well that he just used to write the recipes.
00:32:49,00:32:51,And he said it's like writing music.
00:32:51,00:32:54,Each component has a definite tonal value.
00:32:54,00:32:56,I can compose a waltz or a funeral march.
00:32:56,00:32:58,That's quite beautiful.
00:32:58,00:32:59,Yeah.
00:32:59,00:33:00,Like playing with smells.
00:33:00,00:33:01,"Well, what is a good smell?"
00:33:01,00:33:02,What?
00:33:02,00:33:03,"It's all a bookshit, isn't it?"
00:33:03,00:33:04,What?
00:33:04,00:33:06,"I mean, there's no smell to this."
00:33:06,00:33:08,Can you just silly flowery smells?
00:33:08,00:33:15,It's sounding off today's lawsuit challenge with it's all bullshit to the makers of Chanel.
00:33:15,00:33:21,"Okay, that's it."
