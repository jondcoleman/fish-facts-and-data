00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
 Hi everyone and welcome to episode

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:09,080
 501 of no such thing as a fish. Well, what do we have for you this week?

3
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:17,000
 We have finished our summer live shows and we have loads of extra bits that I couldn't fit into the normal

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,560
 15 minute to an hour episode of fish

5
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:27,640
 Usually what we would do with those is we'd make them into a compilation and they would go for our club fish members

6
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:30,080
 That's where all the compilations go these days

7
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:38,640
 But seeing as they were the live shows that were coming to the end of summer and that we're all sleeping off our hangovers from episode

8
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:45,840
 500 we thought we would put this up on our main feed now the thing is about these episodes is if you like the

9
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:53,180
 Facts on fish then these are some of the best episodes for you because they are super concentrated of little nuggets of information

10
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:56,600
 But there's loads of fun silly stuff in there as well

11
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:02,000
 I really hope you enjoy it if you like your compilations, then you can become a member of club fish

12
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,520
 You will also get ad free episodes

13
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:10,440
 You'll get other bonus contents such as drop as a line where we go through the mailbox and meet the elves where we meet some of our

14
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:13,840
 Newer members of staff at QI. There's also stuff on there

15
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:19,520

 It is Richard Osmar

28
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:41,340
 Have you heard there's a great anecdote which I've been trying to prove but it's I don't think it's true. I was

29
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:45,360
 Actually, it's not true, and it's not relevant. Let's move on

30
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:51,560
 Well, we got a lot quicker than normal didn't we? It's great

31
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:54,280
 Usually I waste all our time, but I'm learning

32
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:57,880
 That's bullshit. That's one of your best stories done

33
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:02,880
 Quickly tell you guys about Alain bombard. Oh, yeah

34
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:08,920
 I was a French doctor and he is very unusual because he's one of the only people in history ever to shipwreck himself

35
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:11,160
 Okay, so this is amazing

36
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:15,840
 There were lots of people at the time being you know lots of shipwreck sailors who were dying each year

37
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:21,560
 We're like when they're when their boats were shipwrecked and he wanted to prove that even if you had no food or water

38
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:25,400
 There were there were ways you could survive so he set off from the canaries

39
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:32,840
 With a sextant a tarpaulin a fishing rod and a sealed box of food and water which he was going to try really hard not to open

40
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:37,800
 The self-control he must have had he suffered terribly like

41
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:44,400
 Yeah, he had no rain for three weeks and then storms snapped the mast of his dinghy

42
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,680
 Swordfish approached his rubber dinghy nose first

43
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:51,120
 I know that's cool

44
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,760
 53 days later he bumped into a ship and they said oh, yeah

45
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:57,560
 You're still 600 miles off course for where you're going, right?

46
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:01,120
 He had just become a father as well when he did this which I find

47
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,800
 Like well at least some sleep

48
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:07,760
 The length some people will go to

49
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:14,600
 So anyway, but anyway, so he he then he got on board this ship which picked him up after 53 days

50
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:16,600
 He had a small lunch of a fried egg

51
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:21,600
 Then got back on his dinghy and kept sailing towards Barbados, right and he made it there in the end

52
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:27,240
 He did it eventually, but yeah, I just think what a what a self-experiment to do that to yourself extraordinary, but why?

53
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:32,000
 What's approved that apart from not to see your child and wife

54
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,800
 I think they're taking 18 years to get

55
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:41,320
 Yeah, I think it was to prove what you could survive on if you could survive on fish or plankton

56
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:46,640
 Which you you can do and you can do that without actually doing it. You could just say oh, I might eat fish today

57
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:52,520
 That's my self-control right there in a tin of food you can't open

58
00:04:52,520 --> 00:05:00,560
 Just out of curiosity have we have we been eating and drinking from the wrong end this whole time

59
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:03,480
 Would there be would there be certain things?

60
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,600
 Well

61
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,920
 Because President Garfield was through his

62
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:14,000
 Famously you've got a bit of your pipe left down

63
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,560
 What better time to put it into practice a

64
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:22,320
 Tutorial if you will I

65
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:29,880
 Think if you have the option the mouth is a better option if we have no other option then the rectum is acceptable

66
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:32,640
 Just fluids though, so I mean if you're trying to absorb lots of nutrients

67
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:36,120
 Okay, then you want then you know your stomach and your upper digestive system will do all that work

68
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:39,440
 So so it is a plan B very much so and I'll still try it

69
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:43,800
 I was looking at people who

70
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:50,760
 Died laughing this happened in 1920 and it was reported by an Australian newspaper called the Mudgee Guardian and Northwestern

71
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:53,720
 Representative okay, do you know it? Yeah? Yeah, that's my

72
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:58,760
 It's about a man called Arthur Cobcroft and I'm really I'm reading directly

73
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:03,640
 So mr. Arthur Cobcroft died at his home in Lofter Street Saturday

74
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:11,200
 He was reading at this 1920 he was reading an old newspaper of a 1915 date and was comparing the prices of various

75
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:13,320
 Commodities with those of today

76
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:19,800
 When he suddenly burst into laughter at the great difference he appeared to be unable to control himself and eventually collapsed and died

77
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:24,120
 Commodity prices

78
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:26,400
 They must have been so different

79
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:29,040
 I'm laughing thinking about it now

80
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:33,600
 It's amazing because I reckon the cost of living crisis isn't that funny today

81
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:38,200
 No, but for him, but if I say to you are like a Freddo used to be 10p

82
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:42,840
 Yeah, I

83
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:46,400
 Was reading about when something goes wrong on stage

84
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:51,960
 And so that got me into a whole territory of if someone is hurt as they're acting

85
00:06:52,120 --> 00:07:00,360
 What do you do and I found this thing that apparently it's a huge problem for paramedics when they're called to help someone

86
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:05,120
 Who's really injured who's in a zombie movie because they arrive

87
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:09,520
 They have no idea who the patient is because everyone is bleeding everyone's got

88
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:13,680
 Even if they find the person who's really injured themselves

89
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,800
 They just can't tell where the wound is because the amount of well

90
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:20,520
 I broke a rib being chased by a zombie once did you yeah?

91
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:24,120
 Yeah, I was in London like one of these things where you pay to be chased by zombies

92
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:27,680
 Yeah

93
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,560
 It does sound a bit like I

94
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:34,680
 Was like watching a lot of American football at the time and the zombie was coming towards me

95
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:37,080
 And I thought I'd do some amazing dodges past him

96
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:42,260
 and I got nowhere near past him and he kind of tagged me and pushed me into a wall and I broke a rib and

97
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:47,560
 They we had to go to like the A&E and there were quite a lot of people who'd had similar problems

98
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:50,600
 And it was just like you say it was like being in mash

99
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:56,600
 It's just people with arms hanging off. You didn't know what was real and what wasn't yeah

100
00:07:56,600 --> 00:08:02,600
 I found out that Bungay in East Anglia has the highest number of satanists in the UK. Oh

101
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:08,040
 Today now I'd like to take issue with that would you because I think it's Bolsova in Derbyshire

102
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:17,140
 How many has Bolsova got 17 17 17 17 in Bungay

103
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:22,640
 Okay, but it might be relative to population. I don't know how big Bungay is sounds tiny

104
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:30,200
 This Bolsova thing is from the census in 2011 when this was from the census. I bet it's is it later census mine

105
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:34,880
 Maybe I don't know 20 21. Yeah, but the in Bolsova

106
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:39,120
 It was only 17 people who wrote satanist as their religion, but that was the highest per person

107
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:44,960
 But highest concentration even Bristol only had 34 people who wrote satanist, but Bristol's huge

108
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:47,280
 So the Google article I saw said

109
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:51,800
 Bungay in East Anglia and then the next one was Bronzebury

110
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:57,040
 London which had 20 so the big gay be contingent of the alphabets

111
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,640
 Beelzebub

112
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:02,200
 The beast yeah

113
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:08,400
 There was a footnote that said they thought Bungay my might been doing it as a kind of tourist attracting thing

114
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:14,760
 Because they've got a big black dog. I can't know what it's called like a myth of a big black a satanic dog

115
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:21,080
 I'm okay, man. Yeah, and they're trying to push that. It's worked. I mean, we're all talking about Bungay all the time

116
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:25,600
 Or did you know there's a pantomime horse arrest in Tesco's

117
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:36,640
 When it was when it was found that the Tesco's budget brand everyday value burgers contain 29% horse meat

118
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:40,400
 Yeah, pantomime horse went to protest in Tesco's

119
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:43,960
 Crying going mommy

120
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:47,640
 And it was led away

121
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:50,120
 And it was never seen

122
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:58,680
 Here's a good quick little tip if you meet someone who's Dutch and they say to you I fuck horses

123
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:01,360
 They don't

124
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:09,040
 Not necessarily you've got it. Oh, I can't confirm for certain. Yeah, so is that Dutch does it sound okay means breeding?

125
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:15,480
 Yeah, they breed horses. Yeah, and there supposedly was a story where the Dutch foreign minister was introduced to JFK

126
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:19,720
 And he said hi how we knew so don't very good. Well, what are your hobbies? I fuck horses and

127
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:23,320
 Why did he only say that one word in Dutch and the rest of it?

128
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:29,760
 That's where I also questioned the anecdotes. Yeah, but it does stand I looked up the translation

129
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:35,080
 Yeah, and fok is for breeding. So yeah, again, you'd never hear that in that kind unless horses

130
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:37,840
 I didn't look up horses and look up if they say that in Dutch

131
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:40,800
 Should we move on?

132
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:49,320
 So one person who did slightly pioneer the idea of living underwater it was Jacques Cousteau Jacques Cousteau you all probably

133
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:57,880
 Know him. He's he's had the calypso and he was one of the greatest ocean. Sorry. I don't you know the dance. No

134
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:03,240
 You know the ice cream using it with a calypso. Yeah, he's one of the greatest

135
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:10,000
 Oceanographers of all time and he kind of pioneered documentary making in the field of immersive and you follow a team and

136
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,560
 The life aquatic by Wes Anderson is very much based on the story of Jacques Cousteau

137
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:20,440
 But on a scientific level he also invented or co-invented the aqualung which is why we're able to go diving

138
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:24,880
 So that was Jacques Cousteau and then one of the other things he did was this thing called the con shells

139
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:32,080
 Which are the continental shells which were habitable zones down in the ocean and continental shelf to was this big looking starfish

140
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:34,440
 kind of housing unit and

141
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:37,240
 He lived in it with his crew for a number of days

142
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:42,480
 They had a parrot that came down and lived with them as well because that in a sort of slightly dark sense

143
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:46,760
 It was like the canary in the mountain. You know something was wrong with the levels of oxygen

144
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:49,880
 Okay, parrot would know first and so they could get out of there

145
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:54,920
 So he set a record for the longest anyone's been down there and then his son Fabian Cousteau

146
00:11:55,880 --> 00:12:00,400
 So he lived down there and held the record for the longest anyone's been under the ocean for quite a while

147
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:03,760
 And then it got taken over by a professor and a student

148
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:07,680
 But he invented a shark submarine. Have you seen this?

149
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:12,600
 This is this is incredible. It's the submarine in the shape of a shark

150
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:18,520
 So the idea is that he can observe sharks while being one of them. It's a one person submersible

151
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:22,500
 No, he has to be in a diving suit while he's in it because water flows all the way through

152
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:29,480
 He has to drive the submarine while laying down in the shark and his elbows are steering it as he goes

153
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:33,360
 Why his elbows? What's he doing with the sun? Sorry, he's not his elbows steering with his hands

154
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,360
 Okay, thank you

155
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:40,220
 He has a needless layer of complication for an otherwise flawless idea. He's on his phone, isn't he and he's just like

156
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:47,440
 I was looking at in British elections, you know, there's that thing of always on election night a general election night

157
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:52,880
 There's a kind of who gets their their ballot counted first and it's which constituencies also

158
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:57,880
 It's usually like Sunderland versus Newcastle Sunderland and Newcastle and you mean like a race to get

159
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:03,760
 Yeah, I was reading about Sunderland's methods for ensuring they stay at the top of their game. Yeah, and they're amazing

160
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:08,360
 So well we're going with it's kind of a tradition now and they've like they've done it

161
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,640
 They've really gone into detail

162
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:14,640
 So they hire bank tellers because they're very good at flipping through lots and lots of paper very quickly like individual bits of paper

163
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:20,360
 They use lighter paper for their ballot sheets because it's slightly easier to count fast

164
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:23,320
 So they switch from a hundred gsm to 80 gsm

165
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:31,700
 Yeah, they do obviously they do practices like they practically dress rehearsals with the students who are running holding the ballot boxes

166
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:35,880
 And they are like they say you're gonna be filmed. You're gonna be you need to be you know careful

167
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:37,880
 you don't want to drop those that'll be a disaster and

168
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:44,160
 They play but always wins in that constituency, right? I think they do I think they always win

169
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:51,040
 I guess they would yeah, but you remember like I always watch the election night and they all the results come in and I

170
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:55,320
 Only stay up for Sunderland the Newcastle a hundred percent labor and then I go to bed

171
00:13:55,320 --> 00:14:03,200
 Always slightly disappointed when I wake up. I get it. Yeah, you can get woolen coffins these days. I believe this is very

172
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:08,600
 Little price for anyone who can guess the headline that was used on the story announcing us in 2011

173
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:13,720
 Take your time that you're allowed woolen coffins now. Yeah as a cool woolen coffin that's been launched

174
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,520
 Gonna have to hurry you

175
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:22,180
 No, no, that's all no, that's all believe silent bits of podcasts a very popular anyone in the audience

176
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:25,200
 This is too tough a quiz handy anyone

177
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:30,760
 What was a burial was good famous phrase cozy bear went with

178
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:33,920
 rest in fleece

179
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:39,440
 Mine very nice, but lovely

180
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:43,000
 Yeah, you can be you can be buried in it or it can be cremated

181
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:48,920
 It's the same in the way you can get cardboard coffins wool coffins willow coffins banana leaf coffins

182
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:54,560
 Or you can now be wrapped in a shroud as we used to be and there's a big movement a natural burial movement

183
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,760
 Which is because there are so many

184
00:14:56,760 --> 00:15:01,200
 Horrible chemicals and a lot of funeral processes, especially if you are embalmed

185
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:04,760
 It's very bad for the environment for your body to go into the ground full of chemicals

186
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:09,800
 Right, so if you have a biodegradable coffin, then you can be buried in like what in a natural burial

187
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:14,660
 It's basically a field that someone's agreed to have people buried in can you get wicker? Yeah wicker

188
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:19,220
 Yeah, and you can also get one that's made of like a mushroom fungus that will start to decompose your body faster

189
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:22,600
 That is cool, and so this is really important

190
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:28,680
 I've talked before a big talk of planning your funeral and advance care planning is big thing that you should write this down now

191
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:35,200
 Otherwise, you're gonna get wrapped in that wool suit. Right. I just like to put it that because this is being recorded and we'll go out

192
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,520
 I do not want to be eaten by mushrooms when okay

193
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:43,840
 Do you want banana leaves or wicker or wool? I'll be putting a big wicker cage and burned by some

194
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:50,720
 And probably some people be dancing around in white in the situation. That's gonna be an amazing podcast when it comes out

195
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:56,840
 One of the suffragettes this was Anne Hunt she walked into the National Portrait Gallery and

196
00:15:56,840 --> 00:16:01,680
 She stopped in front of a portrait of Thomas Carlisle who's one of the founders

197
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:07,120
 Painted by Millay and she slashed it. It was a really famous thing that she did

198
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:14,080
 There was only one member of staff who was suspicious. I was guy called David Wilson and the first time she walked in

199
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:16,480
 He wasn't that suspicious. He thought she was American

200
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:23,200
 Apparently he thought she was American because she was looking so closely at the pictures

201
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:27,560
 Apparently that's what Americans do but then the second day she came back in again

202
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:35,800
 And David Wilson said they she couldn't be American because no American would have paid the six pence entrance fee twice over

203
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:39,360
 So it's like that must be someone that's up to no good

204
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:43,440
 Was she coming back? Had she already slashed something? No the first time she went in was to kind of

205
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:49,820
 Yeah, so there were lots of sort of famous incidents like particular flash points where for example

206
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:54,520
 Mrs. Pankhurst was going to speak at an event and then and you know the police didn't want it to happen

207
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:59,200
 And so that became a course celebrity. So there was an event called the Battle of Glasgow

208
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:05,000
 The Mrs. Pankhurst was going to Glasgow to speak and the police did not want her to appear

209
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,880
 They didn't want her to speak

210
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:12,400
 There were 50 police constables in the basement of the building where she was billed to appear all the tickets have been sold

211
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:15,320
 You know huge presence like people checking everyone on the door

212
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:22,000
 Suddenly Mrs. Pankhurst appears on stage out of nowhere and it turns out she just come in as a punter with a ticket

213
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,400
 Sat by the platform and then gets up and start speaking

214
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:28,800
 So all the police start coming up from the basement because they're you know, they're activated

215
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:31,800
 Meanwhile

216
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:35,880
 25 of the suffragette bodyguards get their clubs out and start trying to beat the police up

217
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:39,240
 Yeah, you know, so you've got 25 suffragettes with clubs 50 policemen with their truncheons

218
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:43,320
 One of the suffragettes shot a policeman in the chest point blank with a blank bullet

219
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:45,400
 So it wasn't it was just a kind of surprise rather than I

220
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:49,040
 Hope she said that

221
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:57,040
 And then playing clothes detectives tried to get onto the platform when Mrs. Pankhurst is still speaking at this point

222
00:17:57,040 --> 00:18:00,600
 Yeah, she's still delivering her speech the playing clothes detectives are trying to climb onto the platform

223
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:05,760
 It turns out the floral garlands all the way around the platform are barbed wire. They've been disguised

224
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:11,400
 There are old ladies now beating the police with their umbrellas as they're trying to fight the truncheon

225
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:15,600
 We're like it just sounds like an insane scene. Who's listening to the speech at this point?

226
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:23,480
 Weird moment today I was researching crisps and I found out in Japan at the moment

227
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:28,740
 There's a trend that's going on and then it turns out this is going global now to eat crisps using chopsticks

228
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:35,040
 So that you don't get the oil on your fingers as you are doing the other work that you're doing right if you're eating

229
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:42,680
 So I was literally eating a bag of crisps as I was researching that fact and my fingers absolutely was sticky on the on the

230
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:49,560
 The Mac sort of mouse bits, you know like keep all keep it. Yeah. Yeah, the keep that like the you know

231
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:53,800
 The hand mouse thing the keypad. Yeah, well the keypads the mouse and the mean the mouse

232
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:56,400
 The tracker the trackpad

233
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,520
 The trackpad

234
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,560
 Gosh, it's like living in the future, isn't it?

235
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:07,480
 I found myself reading a piece about historical novels by a radical

236
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:13,360
 James Forester, I just want to quote from this article. He wrote about ten years ago and listen to this

237
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:16,240
 He was because he reads a lot and he I think he wrote historical novels, too

238
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:25,360
 One highly acclaimed and commercially successful recent historical novel had on page three the statement that there were no priests within a three-day ride

239
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:32,360
 Taking into consideration the time of year and the location of this statement. I calculated that there were between five and eight thousand priests

240
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:39,160
 Within a three-day ride in that year. I could not carry on reading

241
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:52,480
 Children are quite weirdly good at lying so or rather they're good

242
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:58,520
 So adults are very bad at telling when children are like this is the thing and the reason for that they can only work

243
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:02,120
 It out about the same as I'm guessing on at like a 54% of the time

244
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:07,640
 So not much better than chance really and the reason for that there are lots of experiments and it's because adults assume that children

245
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:11,040
 Lie like adults do and they assume that children's faces

246
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:15,160
 Move in the same ways that adults do but basically there have been a load of experiments

247
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:21,640
 Which assumed that children are not proficient liars and in fact the problem is that children just look guilty quite a lot of the time

248
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:28,440
 Like because you talk to a young child though. They might divert their eyes. They might fidget. They might be incoherent

249
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:35,600
 They look they look like they look like they're hiding something and that's so adults think they're lying when they may will not be so yeah

250
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:41,440
 I think I look permanently guilty. It makes me a bad liar, but it also makes me a really bad truth teller

251
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:45,840
 That's the problem because I look like I'm lying whatever so any lie I tell I'm gonna get cortex

252
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:49,680
 I look like I'm lying and any time I tell the truth. No one believes me because I look like I'm lying

253
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:54,880
 It's very difficult. That's why I have to have the computer in front of me on point this

254
00:20:54,880 --> 00:21:01,120
 One of the reasons that we have X as the X man and their

255
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:05,000
 X-ray and stuff like that is because day car

256
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:09,560
 Used X to mean an unknown in algebra. Yeah, wasn't it?

257
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:15,560
 He decided to use X Y and Z and the story goes that the reason he did it is because the printer

258
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:19,780
 Who was doing his books and I got loads of X's Y's and Z's left over because no words have

259
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:22,480
 So I might as well use them

260
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:26,440
 But it turns out that because he's French actually X is quite a common

261
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:31,440
 Relatively common in French and it might have been because they just had lots of X's because X is quite common

262
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:35,360
 But yeah, but without those without day car. We might not have the X man

263
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:40,440
 We might have the a man or the other be man or whatever. Oh, wow. We wouldn't have the seaman

264
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:45,440
 Probably not

265
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:51,980
 So I was I was looking into things that are named after people and I was thinking I was reasoning that there must be something

266
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:55,680
 Which is the most famous thing that people don't know is named after a person

267
00:21:55,680 --> 00:22:02,400
 So we've said before like shrapnel is named after a bloke who was called general Henry shrapnel

268
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:05,340
 I think I said the nachos were named after a guy called

269
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:12,280
 So we've done a few of these before and I the cardigan do people know it was named after the seventh Earl of cardigan

270
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:17,600
 Okay, that is known because I read an article claiming that he was wearing one while he led the charge of the library cage

271
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:24,760
 I thought that can't that can't be right there would have been a uniform because it feels too. Yeah, yeah

272
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:27,760
 Well, like pushing his merch during war

273
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:35,160
 Yeah, I mean, yeah, it is named after him, but yeah, I think and it was during the Battle of Balaclava

274
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:37,240
 That's the thing that we don't know

275
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:43,240
 Yeah, and then cravat go back to croats because croats were those yeah, and

276
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:47,680
 Slaves were sloths. I mean, that's not quite eponyms

277
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:51,880
 It's the kind of toponyms but and and I'm really sorry to always lower the tone

278
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:58,240
 But I don't know that bugger is actually a riff on Bulgarian because there were these Bulgarian sects in the 11th

279
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:04,360
 Sects in the 11th century there was supposed to get up to strange sex. So that's where bugger

280
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:08,040
 Yeah, that's kind of topping in there wasn't it really not an eponym

281
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:12,720
 Strictly speaking

282
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:20,280
 In 1996 the Swedish Navy admitted that they had found a huge amount of evidence of Russian submarines operating in their waters

283
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:24,440
 Right really serious, you know post-Cold War threatening security environment

284
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:29,960
 And there had been six thousand incidents a huge number reported from 1981 to 1994

285
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:32,160
 It turns out that what they had been hearing was largely

286
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:35,000
 Otters splashing

287
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:37,480
 Playful otters splashing in the water

288
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:42,120
 There about one in a thousand claims would was likely to be a submarine and the rest was just random

289
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:51,960
 They found out that it was farting fish as well, didn't they? Yeah, they communicate by farting

290
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:57,160
 In fact, we have this fact so qi, which is herring communicate by farting

291
00:23:57,160 --> 00:24:01,680
 Yes, and we tweet it about once a year just so that everyone tweets Richard herring to go

292
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,840
 Oh, I didn't know you

293
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:07,200
 He hates us

294
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:12,880
 I couldn't imagine so the thing I want to mention about protests is to do with another quiz show which is mastermind

295
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:17,840
 And the first question ever was about protests and it was about a painting by Picasso

296
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:21,920
 Which was a protest about the bombing by Spanish planes on a village and the question was

297
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:25,760
 What year when the event took place was the inspiration for the painting?

298
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:28,160
 The answer was 1937

299
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:32,720
 The answer was 1937, but the question was about German planes not Spain

300
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:36,400
 So the first ever question on mastermind was incorrect

301
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,880
 Yeah

302
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,880
 So how shit is mastermind

303
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:46,160
 I just I just feel like it's qi and countdown on stage together. Let's shit on someone

304
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:52,080
 What do you reckon soothe this shit? Yeah, let's get some headlines. That's it. Yes. Wait

305
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:58,640
 Oh, I don't want to diss any other shit. Yeah, that was vicious. Um

306
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:05,360
 Just on religion while we're there, um, there's been a few naked religions in the past

307
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:07,600
 So the adomites

308
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:11,040
 They were a sect in north Africa in the second third and fourth centuries

309
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:14,720
 That used always worn no clothes during the religious ceremonies

310
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:18,800
 The idea being that they were going back to the Garden of Eden before we had clothes

311
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:20,880
 And this was the best way to get close to God

312
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:26,560
 Now it became big again in the Czech Republic in Czechia in 14th century

313
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:30,960
 And people who were adomites then would go naked through the towns and villages

314
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:35,840
 So they would everyone take their clothes off and they would go through the town saying come and join our gang

315
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:41,120
 You know, we're the we're the closest to Jesus. Conga basically you're describing a naked conga

316
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:44,960
 Sure. Let's call it a naked. Well, they did do a lot of naked dances

317
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:48,880
 They would have a fire and they would do naked dances around it and the idea was

318
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:55,280
 That they rejected a lot of the things in the catholic church and a lot of people think that they were like the precursors to the Protestant revolution

319
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:59,920
 So it was like, you know, they was with the first people really to kind of go against the church

320
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:02,800
 And then it kind of built up and built up in central europe

321
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:08,240
 But it carried all of the Cromwell trimmed a lot of that stuff away. Didn't he before it came up with puritanism

322
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:12,000
 Yeah, sorry and then it carried on and in the early us

323
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:17,280
 They had some adomites there and I was reading about one clergyman who was writing about them and he said um

324
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,960
 About these people who were in church and were naked the whole time

325
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:27,760
 If the planets of venus reigned in their lower parts making them swell for pride or rather for lust

326
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:33,600
 Then the clerk with his long stick shall strike down the presumptuous flesh

327
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:36,080
 So basically

328
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:38,480
 If you yeah, you would yeah

329
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:43,920
 And he said that on one occasion there was a woman who made a congregation member

330
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:51,520
 Rise in such an unmeasurable manner that the old clerk was forced to use both hands to elate his courage

331
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:58,880
 At which the prophesizer was in such pain that the whole house could not hold him and he said he would kill the clerk

332
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:03,520
 And basically this guy just started whacking his genitals with his stick

333
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:08,480
 He attacked that guy and basically they only just stopped him from killing the clerk

334
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:14,960
 But this guy said he wasn't bothered because it was in church. God will look after him and it didn't matter if he killed the clerk

335
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:17,040
 Because it was naked. It would all be fine

336
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:21,120
 It feels like we feels like pants is just easier, isn't it?

337
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:28,720
 So burrowing owls they have lots of piles of poo outside the nest and it's cow dung and bison dung and all of this

338
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:31,280
 And then they just stand by the poo

339
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:35,360
 And wait they just go into kind of sentry position and just stand there looking very still

340
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,840
 And what scientists reckon is that they're fishing for dung beetles

341
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:46,880
 Oh freshish dung and dung beetles are really interested in burrowing owls love eating the the dung beetles

342
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:52,720
 And so they'll just stand and wait and let the dung beetles approach. Isn't that crazy? They're basically they're basically fishing

343
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:56,880
 Like they're land fishing. Yeah. No, I got it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah

344
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:02,400
 I try to find a uh, if there was another naughty barbie, you know

345
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:08,560
 Kind of like the origins of barbie being a cool girl and I managed to find one which was the pole dancing barbie

346
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:14,800
 This was a one-off because it was part of a thing in japan called hebo con which was you know, like robot wars

347
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:21,520
 This was anti robot wars. This was a robot wars where everyone's specific negotiations. No, no

348
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:24,960
 You you have to summit

349
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:27,040
 robot model un

350
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:32,080
 You had to bring a very bad robot basically it had to be terrible and so

351
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:35,200
 The worse it was the better you got in the competition

352
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:41,040
 Okay, you were so there were 31 entrants and barbie doll that was entered was a attacking

353
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:46,320
 Through pole dancing barbie, but the other ones that it went up. How did she attack you with a pole dance?

354
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:48,320
 Did she spin round and kick you in the head?

355
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:52,480
 I think so because I couldn't find any photos because this was in 2013 and I think

356
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:56,720
 So

357
00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:01,600
 No, so I but it's you know was a small thing that happened in japan the winner was a robot that was so sturdy

358
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:05,920
 That no one could knock it over so it just stood so the other things walked into it

359
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:10,480
 Okay, that's the best one was the uh the person who got a special acknowledgement

360
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:16,080
 Was one person a lady who accidentally left her robot on the train and then just went for a beer instead

361
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:19,760
 And they were like that level of shitness is so great. We want to

362
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:22,560
 Commend you with a special honor there. That's awesome

363
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:28,240
 But yeah pole dancing barbie the only one time in a anti robot war japanese competition hebo con very cool

364
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:33,840
 Yeah, there is a thing called the bubble babba challenge. This is at the voxki river in russia

365
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:37,760
 So it's near st. Petersburg. Uh, and it's a race

366
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:39,440
 a

367
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:43,120
 Kind of a rafting race, but instead of a raft you have a sex doll

368
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:46,480
 Uh, it began in 2003

369
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:50,640
 Anyone's allowed to enter but you have to have a compulsory alcohol test before you start

370
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:54,560
 Oh, yeah, we don't want to we don't want to make this seem tawdry or unprofessional

371
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:59,120
 And in 2006

372
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:02,160
 That guy riding the sex doll down the river's had a shandy

373
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:08,800
 The most exciting of the bubble babba challenge

374
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:11,440
 Sex doll races was in 2006

375
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:13,680
 So all the races jumped into the water

376
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:18,480
 And there was a really really strong wind and that meant that almost all the sex dolls blew away

377
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:23,760
 And so you've just got all these rushing mostly guys in the water just sort of without their sex dolls

378
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:28,160
 And there was only one person the guy called osipov who reached the finish line

379
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:30,560
 But he was disqualified

380
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:35,600
 Because the jury had noticed signs of recent sexual activity on the doll

381
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:40,080
 Which was very much banned

382
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:46,000
 I've got another but we've got another barbie thing. Okay. Yeah barbie has uh, officially

383
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,280
 Not part of any political party, right? So there's a

384
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:53,840
 Various reasons for that. She's been a presidential candidate every election since 1992

385
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:56,160
 Uh, much like hillary clinton

386
00:30:56,160 --> 00:31:04,320
 Um, not fair. Um, but she got in a she got in a beef with donald j trump bar barbie and donald j trump had a had a

387
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:10,640
 Beef at the last election. Um, because donald j trump tweeted. There's a thing called voter barbie. And it's doing courage

388
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:12,640
 What do you keep saying j in his name?

389
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:19,840
 Oh, sorry. That's his junior. I'm talking about donald trump jr. Okay. I believe. Yeah. Yeah, okay. Can't be the senior

390
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:24,240
 I mean, they're both such they're both such different. Yes

391
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:31,440
 Well, I don't know who I don't know which of them said this. I think it was jr. But basically one of the trumps

392
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:37,200
 Uh tweeted voter barbie must be a democrat because she's already wearing an i voted sticker

393
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:39,680
 And yet she's got another ballot in her hand

394
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:45,440
 And matel had to reply barbie is not and never has been affiliated with a political party

395
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:51,920
 To an official statement saying she's not a democrat. Yeah. Yeah. Wow. I think she is though clearly clearly

396
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:55,680
 Can I tell you one more dueling method that happened? Yeah

397
00:31:55,680 --> 00:32:01,120
 So basically the you know the thing about you turn back to back and then you walk and then you there are various different methods in different

398
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:05,520
 Countries walk ten paces turn around shoot. Sorry. Yes. So the back. That's french basically

399
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:09,920
 Um, and there is a much more fun variant which has another french name. It's called avalante

400
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:13,920
 You face each other. Can we do the fun duel?

401
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:19,760
 There was people really relished it, you know, a certain kind of person really seemed to enjoy it

402
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:25,120
 So there's a variant called avalante where you face each other, right and you start walking towards each other

403
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:29,600
 You can either of you can fire whenever you like but if you miss

404
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:32,240
 You have to stand still and wait for the other

405
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:35,760
 Guy to shoot right. I know and that feels tense

406
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:41,040
 I thought you were going to say that you're standing right in front of each other and then you walk backwards away from each other

407
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:44,960
 And then you're just hoping someone's not kneeling down behind you

408
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:47,920
 That's amazing really

409
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:52,880
 It used to be in the Olympics, didn't it pistol dueling? Yeah, 1906

410
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:57,840
 It was one of the categories. It wasn't a medal one, but you would you would

411
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:01,920
 So it was it was a thing that was done there because the winner would be dead. Yeah

412
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:08,240
 Just pick him up. I'm gonna put a silver medal on

413
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:13,120
 But that would be the there was like an intercalary games wasn't there in 1906

414
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:18,720
 It wasn't the main game and they used wax bullets and the idea was you would just see who got hit first

415
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:25,680
 And you had the sort of glass plate that was over your face and but it was done as a proper thing with spectators around and everything

416
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:26,880
 Yeah, it was very exciting

417
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:30,160
 Have we said before that I think nasa found the oldest known rock

418
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:34,000
 The oldest known earth rock was on the moon and then brought back to earth. Yes

419
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:37,600
 It was called big bertha was the name of the rock

420
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:43,200
 Was it yeah, it was yeah, they named it after a I think a gun from the first world war

421
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:48,320
 So they brought that back and it was the first earth meteorite ever found on another body as in the first

422
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:53,360
 Like meteor out if you like, you know the first like bit of earth that it hit somewhere else

423
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:58,880
 Wasn't that the moon created when uh an asteroid hit the earth and there's a little splash. So they say so they say yeah

424
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:01,440
 No, I'm not sure I buy it. Yeah

425
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:05,680
 Pixar didn't happen. There's actually a strong theory that it is hollow

426
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:09,600
 So, uh

427
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:12,720
 Is this the moon cave theory

428
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:18,560
 Oh, yeah, I haven't heard it called that before but yeah, I suppose. Yeah, because supposedly when you hit it, it rings like a bell

429
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:23,280
 So is it artificial? Is it real? Listen, you mean when a meteorite hits a knife? You just go

430
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:28,800
 No, when they did drilling on the moon they they they specifically tried to find out because you can do

431
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,160
 You can do well

432
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:35,680
 You can do seismic tests on the moon to see what the composure is on the inside right and it was completely empty apparently and so

433
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:43,600
 I'm joking. Hannah. I'm joking. I promise. Thank you. Yeah. Yeah. Thank you. Have you ever been in a diamond mine in your adventures, Hannah?

434
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:46,000
 No, I haven't. I wonder what that's like. Hmm

435
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:52,400
 I see we've run out of facts and entered speculation territory

436
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:55,600
 God

437
00:34:55,600 --> 00:35:01,360
 And you've mentioned oscar the hypno dog before on the podcast. Can you remember what that was oscar the hypno dog was a

438
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:04,720
 Labrador who was a hypnot who was hypnotically trained

439
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:11,600
 And went and like went missing and there were signs put up all over the country saying do not look at this talk

440
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:16,400
 Is that it? That's it. Yeah. Yeah. Basically

441
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:19,040
 He's dangerous

442
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:24,080
 We have mentioned that but what I'd never heard before was about puffy the hypno cat

443
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:28,560
 Amazing. Uh puffy the hypno cat was in the 1940s in america

444
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:33,040
 There was a guy who owned a bar and he said that puffy was sitting on the end of a nightclub bar

445
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:37,200
 And a couple of girls came up to him and I didn't really pay attention what happened

446
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:41,760
 But suddenly a girl was simply out on her feet. She simply wasn't from drinking

447
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:44,080
 I'm something of a hypnotist myself

448
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:50,960
 And I realized she was in a hypnotic trance and it turned out that this cat had been hypnotizing people

449
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:53,360
 in this guy's bar

450
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:59,600
 And he started then training the cats to stare at people really really fixedly to try and hypnotize them

451
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:08,560
 And puffy became really really famous and in 1945 the american feline society called her the king of all cats

452
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:11,520
 Um because she was bringing in money for war bonds

453
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:16,160
 So you would go into the bar and you would pay some money to be hypnotized by the cat

454
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:18,800
 And then you know, they get the money for the war

455
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:24,400
 And by the end of her life, she was credited with hypnotizing over 300 people

456
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:29,520
 Always for benign purposes. I just well I spent all my money on tinned tuner

457
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:32,480
 It's so weird

458
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:36,240
 Just left it open around the place probably probably nothing

459
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:41,600
 And you Hannah you're such a skeptic you probably don't even believe that story's true

460
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:45,760
 Actually that one I'm really behind

461
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:52,960
 One of us on this panel might be slightly harder to hypnotize than the other three. Oh, okay, can we guess it?

462
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:56,400
 um

463
00:36:56,400 --> 00:37:02,640
 Is it done because of his dubious questioning techniques? It's not done because of his dubious questioning techniques

464
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:09,760
 I feel like Hannah with her skepticism. It's not Hannah with her dubious skepticism thing

465
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:14,720
 Is it Andy with his lack of ability to talk to people at parties? It's not me

466
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:20,800
 James for being so fucking judgmental about the other three people on the panel

467
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:31,680
 It's james, but not for that reason not for that reason it's because so james you have aphantasia, right? Oh, right, okay

468
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:36,080
 James can't you say what it is? I just can't picture things in my head can't picture things in your head

469
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:39,520
 Yeah, and that might make it harder to hypnotize you. It's there was a well

470
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:46,400
 This is from the uk hypnosis convention, which sounds amazing last year's events included recreational erotic hypnosis

471
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:51,360
 Uh, and aphantasia. What is it and why should we even care slightly?

472
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:55,600
 Slightly barbed

473
00:37:55,600 --> 00:38:02,880
 I don't know much time we got I got very deep in the weeds on people who want to be heroes and do bad stuff

474
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:09,600
 Oh, yeah, yeah, go for it. Uh, have you heard of the hero complex? No. No, so it's not quite a psychological disorder

475
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:13,040
 It's not in the diagnostic manuals, but it's like talked about by psychologists

476
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:17,920
 It's a thing where it's sometimes known as a vanity crime where people are desperate to be the hero

477
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:21,040
 So they'll do something bad so they can then rescue people

478
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:24,160
 Like I'd mug you but then beat myself up. Yeah, exactly

479
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:30,240
 Exactly that and hand yourself in I guess is the idea. Yeah, yeah, yeah, but I rough myself up a bit first

480
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:34,880
 Why stop that a bit of a lifetime?

481
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:40,720
 But like there's there's quite a lot of case studies the really famous one's 1984 an la pd

482
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:44,960
 police officer called jimmy wade pierce and heroically discovered and diffused a pipe bomb

483
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:48,000
 On an airport bus carrying the turkish olympic team in la

484
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:54,880
 And people saw him running down like the airport holding a pipe bomb dismantling and throwing over his shoulder and shouting get out

485
00:38:54,880 --> 00:39:00,000
 You know like proper like bruce willis stuff and it turned out he had planted it there

486
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:05,920
 Because he wanted to be the hero because he wanted to transfer into a different department and his boss hated him

487
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:09,440
 And he thought the only way i'm getting out is if I get a commendation

488
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:15,120
 And he failed the polygraph and he ended up with 1500 hours of community service and it became a bit of a thing

489
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:19,840
 But everyone was like all right well no one was hurt fair enough, but then there's some really bad ones

490
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:25,840
 So there's a thing called firefighter arson, which is a serious problem. Yeah, you heard of this. Yeah, yeah, yeah

491
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:29,280
 There are a hundred firefighters every year arrested for arson

492
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:33,520
 In america alone. There's a million firefighters. So it's a tiny statistic, but a hundred people

493
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:40,080
 Most of them are young men age 16 to 30. I read a whole report issued in 2003 by the u.s. government's national fire administration

494
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:41,680
 I got very deep

495
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:43,840
 There are six primary motives excitement

496
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:49,040
 Vandalism revenge profit political terrorism hiding evidence of a crime

497
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:53,040
 And it's a really big problem for a small subset

498
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:57,680
 And there's a guy who's a tenancy fire chief. He's set fire to his own fire station

499
00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:04,960
 Wow, he caused the three-quarters of a million dollars of damage and when released he then set fire to a car dealership

500
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:09,120
 And he did it for the sexual thrill. This is why we need pawn hub

501
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:14,160
 Yeah sexual sexual thrill he gay got off on the uniting the worst ones john or

502
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:20,400
 He was from glendale fire service in california in 1991 was found to have planned eight arson attacks on shops

503
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:24,400
 And was suspected of many more. He killed four people in these fires. It's really really horrible

504
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:26,720
 His main job at the glendale service

505
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:29,280
 Chief arson investigator

506
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:30,240
 Wow

507
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:35,520
 Hover story and so they tailed him for months and every time there was a fire investigating conference

508
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:37,520
 There would be fires in the local area

509
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:41,120
 And he was possibly alleged to have set 2000 fires

510
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:43,520
 Making the most prolific american arsonist

511
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:49,360
 Unrecord but one of the clues that they detected about him is that he had written a novel about a fireman who sets fires

512
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:53,920
 It's like a serious thing and

513
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:57,600
 I'm so sorry to get stuck on this, but I then watched fireman sam with my four-year-old dog

514
00:40:57,600 --> 00:41:02,800
 So, yeah, and I went does he do that? Hang on a second for sexual thrills. No

515
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:07,520
 I work for cbbs. I don't want to get cancelled

516
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:13,040
 But like I realized fireman sam he he's in charge of a tiny tiny village called ponty pandy

517
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:18,080
 But he's got a fire truck a rescue tender a four-wheel drive suv within built animal rescuing crane

518
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:23,680
 A quad bike an amphibious vehicle a hovercraft two helicopters and a mobile command center

519
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:30,080
 This guy is playing the game like he's clearly set fires that get like a huge budget

520
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:37,120
 Um, can I just say one thing about george banard short very quickly? Yeah, he he had you I'm saying it wrong am I? No

521
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,560
 Like bernard is also in there. It's gay org. Yeah. Yeah

522
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:50,720
 I've never heard it, but like george bernard. Yeah, oh george bernard. Sure. Yeah. Yeah. Okay, george. I'm cool. Whatever. Hey, it's all cool here

523
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:54,640
 It's late night at the soho. Yeah, picking each other up on pronouncing. I'm gonna go home going god

524
00:41:54,640 --> 00:42:01,280
 There was this mad fucking fight about how to pronounce bernard. Oh man. You got to see fish live. Sorry. I'm sorry

525
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:06,720
 Um, no, so, um, he used to have a riding shed which was amazing

526
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:11,760
 He used to he lived in heritford sure and he had a riding shed which was basically on a lazy susan

527
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:14,000
 He liked to chase the sun

528
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:19,280
 So he would get in the sun would be beaming right in which was a big thing for him because he had specific glass

529
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:24,720
 Which is in the shed windows that kind of beamed concentrated light in a way that it was meant to be healthy

530
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:26,720
 It was thought to be a healthy. It was always on fire, wasn't it?

531
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:31,200
 Bernhardt

532
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:37,760
 Tell you a bit about milk floats. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah for one thing milk doesn't float

533
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:44,640
 Oh, that's yeah

534
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:50,080
 If it's food for thorns, isn't it? Yeah left on water. It will sink. So, um

535
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:52,720
 Oh, but no, but if you mix it

536
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:57,120
 It's oh if you mix it if you mix it. Yeah, that's yeah, that's not that wasn't the terms

537
00:42:57,120 --> 00:43:02,720
 I was anyway at the point milk floats to all UK has an FAQ page and it's one of the like it's a very it's a

538
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:09,040
 Gorgeous website milk floats dot org dot uk. I cannot recommend it enough and the FAQ page begins

539
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:13,360
 All right, maybe they are not exactly frequently asked, but

540
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:20,720
 They might be the kind of questions people might ask given the opportunity

541
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:25,040
 It's so nice. It's so good

542
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:30,880
 Yeah, uh, you want to do a quick game of is it bigger in europe or america? Oh, yes, I do

543
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:33,600
 Okay, what year?

544
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:40,640
 2023. Oh, wow. Okay. So where would you find the world's biggest dump truck?

545
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:43,200
 dump truck

546
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:44,640
 USA america

547
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:50,480
 That's that's a mark of pride. I'm afraid not it's in belleras in europe really

548
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:58,240
 Yeah, the bell has 757 at 10 which can move the equivalent of 1000 whale testicles in one go

549
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:02,800
 That's that's my comparison. That's not the advertising

550
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:05,920
 That's how you measure trucks

551
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:08,240
 I think we all know that

552
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:10,400
 The world's largest log jam

553
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:16,160
 So that's when you have a load of logs in a river and they get stuck and so where is it? Europe or america?

554
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:21,040
 Oh america. Well, I was tricked last time. So I'll I'll say Europe this time. Well, you've been tricked again, andy

555
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:23,600
 It's in none of us in canada

556
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:31,120
 And the interesting thing about that is that it's about 20 square miles of log jam and it goes deep as well

557
00:44:31,120 --> 00:44:37,600
 And the logs store enough carbon to run 2.5 million cars for a year. Wow

558
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:40,000
 That's interesting. Sorry. Is that a

559
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:43,200
 Is a genuine question. Is that logs that have been cut by humans? No

560
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:48,400
 It's they usually are like knocked down by wind and stuff like that and they fall into the river and they go down the river

561
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:52,560
 And then there's like a little sort of point where they can't get out and then they just jam and jam and jam and jam

562
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:54,640
 And it's a really good way of hiding carbon

563
00:44:54,640 --> 00:45:01,120
 And then finally the world's biggest barometer. Europe or america. Europe. I think I own I think I have that in my home

564
00:45:01,120 --> 00:45:03,840
 You've got a massive barometer andy. Yeah

565
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:06,800
 Don't boast

566
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:10,240
 It's a famous barometer. Is it? Oh god

567
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:15,440
 It's one you see every day on tv on tv every day. Is there a barometer connected to big ben?

568
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:19,920
 It's good. If there is I don't know about it. It's a clock, but secretly also a barometer. Oh, wow

569
00:45:20,080 --> 00:45:24,880
 But it is in europe. Uh, it is in europe. It is on shepherds bush roundabout

570
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:30,640
 Uh, it's uh, oh, yes, we all tune it. Sorry. We all tune in every morning for five minutes

571
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:33,520
 Just watch the live feed of shepherds bush roundabout

572
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:36,160
 Let me get on with our day, don't we? You know

573
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:38,880
 There's check what the pressure's like

574
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:45,280
 What it's um, no, it's it's a huge barometer. It was built as a barometer. It no longer works as a barometer

575
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:47,520
 It's currently covering up a big pipe

576
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:55,600
 By um, london water, but it that building was what inspired the score column in the tv show pointless

577
00:45:55,600 --> 00:45:59,120
 Inspired by the world's biggest barometer

578
00:45:59,120 --> 00:46:02,720
 These are easy i'm surprised you haven't got any of these

579
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:08,000
 Yeah, yeah, to barometers. Do they do they go up or down? I can't remember now turns which way you hold them

580
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:11,920
 Yeah, okay, but they can go upright and what the weather's doing. Yeah. Yeah, it's just weird because when you said big ben

581
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:14,400
 I suddenly had this image of the the um

582
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:20,320
 The mercury going up in a barometer, right and it suddenly because I was at a fair the other week and my son did that strongman thing

583
00:46:20,320 --> 00:46:21,920
 Where you hit it has to hit the bell

584
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:28,480
 Do you think there's anyone strong enough in the world that if that thing had to hit the bell of big ben that they could hit it hard enough?

585
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:30,960
 No, so let's move on

586
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:42,960
 One thing I do know about it is that um, there's a lot of rhesus stuff in there, right? Oh rhesus pieces

587
00:46:43,120 --> 00:46:47,680
 Rhesus pieces which is like an american candy, but it was huge for them

588
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:53,040
 So the sales went up like 65 percent the next week just after it been in this movie

589
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:59,760
 And the interesting thing about that is that they weren't the first choice if you look at the original scripts

590
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:03,600
 All of the bits where it says rhesus pieces it was originally going to be m&m's

591
00:47:03,600 --> 00:47:09,040
 But apparently marz turned it down because they didn't want to be associated with aliens

592
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:12,320
 They're called marz

593
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:14,880
 I

594
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:17,920
 I've got some stuff on dropping things from parachutes

595
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:27,200
 Okay, this is about a place called franz star ranch and brothel in navada and i'm in

596
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:32,480
 They had an idea of a an advertising campaign

597
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:36,720
 Where they will put a mattress in the middle of an airfield

598
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:41,120
 And if anyone could parachute to land on the mattress

599
00:47:41,120 --> 00:47:46,480
 Then they would have a chance to spend the evening with any of the women in the brothel

600
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:48,960
 It didn't go very well

601
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:52,320
 The problem was that all the women would stand near to the

602
00:47:52,320 --> 00:47:57,200
 Near to the place where people had to land right and the guy flying the airplane

603
00:47:57,200 --> 00:48:01,200
 Not that high could see everything that was happening and got completely distracted

604
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:03,920
 There was also some sidewinds and

605
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:06,560
 Long story short he crashed the plane

606
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:08,240
 No

607
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:11,920
 Everyone was fine. Oh no one died and the great

608
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:17,120
 Great moral of the story in the end is the crash plane was so good for business

609
00:48:17,120 --> 00:48:23,440
 That they decided to leave it there and it's still there in navada if you ever see that crash plane next to the brothel

610
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:25,840
 Is the what are you looking at me?

611
00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:29,200
 I've never been to navada

612
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:32,240
 Well now I think you have

613
00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:39,040
 Wow, isn't that an amazing idea for advertising? Yeah. Yeah, it's an amazing idea. Sorry

614
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:45,120
 How low was the plane when he got distracted? It was quite low, but high enough the parachutes would work

615
00:48:45,120 --> 00:48:47,840
 Yeah, so that's quite high for a pilot to be like

616
00:48:47,840 --> 00:48:54,880
 It's just like a little stick woman on the ground. Exactly check out the I think arms

617
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:58,080
 On her maybe arms

618
00:48:58,080 --> 00:49:01,760
 No, it's a tree. That's a tree. Okay. Yeah, that's okay

619
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:05,040
 Do you know that john major and tina turner were born on the same day?

620
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:07,120
 Why?

621
00:49:07,120 --> 00:49:13,520
 Yeah, really that's cool. Yeah, if my memory is I didn't actually write that. Wow, that's not memory. That's not memory. Yeah

622
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:16,240
 Wow, I once you hear that you're gonna forget that now hurry

623
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:20,640
 You know everyone who was born on the same day as john major

624
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:23,920
 classic Andy

625
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:28,720
 In february 2020. Yeah, there was a poll by the center of public opinion

626
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:32,480
 This is in the united states. It was ahead of the primary in new hampshire

627
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:41,680
 And they asked a load of voters what they would rather and they found that 64 percent of democrats would rather see a giant meteor strike the earth

628
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:46,000
 extinguishing all human life than see president trump reelected

629
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:52,800
 You know, um, there's been a sequel to phantom of the opera andrew Lloyd Webber's phantom the opera. Okay. Um

630
00:49:53,600 --> 00:49:57,280
 Yeah, it was it was written by ben elton and it was music by

631
00:49:57,280 --> 00:50:03,040
 Andrew Lloyd Webber, but it was delayed for months in the writing process because of cats

632
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:06,080
 The musical

633
00:50:06,080 --> 00:50:12,960
 His real-life cat he had a kitten who stood on his digital piano and wiped out all the music that he had done

634
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:17,760
 In the writing of it, which just feels god bless that kitten

635
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:26,640
 There was a group of secret operatives from britain called the choir boys

636
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:34,320
 And they came up with a plan during world war two to drive hitler mad by eardropping huge amounts of pornography into his compound

637
00:50:34,320 --> 00:50:36,320
 Oh, wow

638
00:50:36,320 --> 00:50:39,760
 In the end they kind of slightly, you know, they came up with the idea

639
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:42,560
 They started going for and they thought, you know, this is just stupid

640
00:50:42,560 --> 00:50:44,800
 And so they called off the whole whole idea

641
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:50,160
 But not before and i quote the group had amassed an enormous collection of suitable material

642
00:50:51,120 --> 00:50:55,600
 Oh, I made an invention once talking of cars and weeing. Um

643
00:50:55,600 --> 00:51:04,880
 Wow, that is a hell of a vending diagram there. I don't think it's it's the it I've forgotten the name. It's a really good name

644
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:08,000
 But basically you can piss and drive

645
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:13,200
 Okay, it was all in the name, which I can't remember my great invention

646
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:16,560
 Oh, yeah, what's wrong with the piss and drive?

647
00:51:17,840 --> 00:51:23,040
 It's not as romantic. No, let's see. Let's see. So it's the idea that you just you don't have to stop off

648
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:27,360
 Yeah, if you can't um like I can't start my car a lot of the time

649
00:51:27,360 --> 00:51:33,680
 So it's annoying having to stop. It's brand new as well. It's an electrical fault. I think anyway, um

650
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:39,360
 So I don't want to stop in case I can't start it again. So many people would get the electrical fault mended

651
00:51:39,360 --> 00:51:43,440
 But I I prefer what you've done engineering system where you never

652
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:53,520
 Does the urine get utilized? I'm thinking screen wash. Oh, yeah, that would work. Well, what it's just what it's mostly water

653
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:57,440
 I'm wondering if it's you pissing all over your electric. So there's stopping the car from functioning

654
00:51:57,440 --> 00:52:00,080
 to begin with

655
00:52:00,080 --> 00:52:03,760
 In norway if you are a fish

656
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:07,120
 Um factory and you're kind of getting the whole the fillets out

657
00:52:07,120 --> 00:52:12,000
 What you'll do is you get the rest of the fish and you'll throw it away into a little area with all the heads and stuff like that

658
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:18,640
 In that area children are allowed to go in and they cut out the little tongs of the cods

659
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:21,200
 And they sell them for extra pocket money

660
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:24,480
 And this is a really common thing in a place called lofferton

661
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:30,080
 Um and from about six years until 17 you'll get loads of kids who'll just go in

662
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:34,720
 Grab the fish and they'll cut out this little tongue in the back and apparently it's the tastiest part

663
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:38,720
 And do you think they turn out to be psychopath like serial killers and psychopaths?

664
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:42,880
 Yeah, unfortunately in that area there is a lot of debt. No, there isn't

665
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:47,760
 Um, do you want to know some other things that people are scared of singers?

666
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:52,560
 Yeah, sure. Yeah, I wrote some dance. I thought I'd do some work after you told me I was getting paid

667
00:52:52,560 --> 00:52:57,200
 Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I forgot to tell you that until yeah quite late in the day

668
00:52:57,200 --> 00:53:01,360
 Um, but thank you for bringing your one sheet of uh

669
00:53:07,120 --> 00:53:13,920
 It wasn't very much i'm getting paid so it is just fitting. Um, wait till you hear them

670
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:19,360
 Adele is scared of seagulls. Who would have thought?

671
00:53:19,360 --> 00:53:25,600
 Oh, no, yeah, yeah, um, there's more

672
00:53:25,600 --> 00:53:30,240
 Rihanna's scared of fish

673
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:33,360
 Okay, and Kylie Minogue is scared of coat hangers

674
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:38,320
 She's scared of coat hangers. Yeah, Kylie Minogue and i'm scared of commitment

675
00:53:38,320 --> 00:53:46,240
 So we're all different aren't we how many different types of wrestling do you think there are in iceland one type of wrestling?

676
00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:51,280
 Unlucky, there are two types of wrestling, but they do have the same name so I can see why you got that

677
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:57,120
 That's what I was thinking. Um, it's called glimmer and basically there's two types and they're quite similar

678
00:53:57,120 --> 00:54:00,800
 But one of them is a type of wrestling that you would do as a viking

679
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:06,240
 If you came home after a long day doing whatever vikings do and you wanted to warm yourself up

680
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:08,800
 They would just do some wrestling

681
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:11,520
 Nice who with with another viking

682
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:18,560
 It's wholesome right? Yeah, there was another one which was the dueling version

683
00:54:18,560 --> 00:54:25,520
 And it was quite similar, but it would take place in a field with a large flat stone known as the slaying slab

684
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:30,960
 And that one you would try and slam your opponent onto the slab and break their back

685
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:36,160
 Wow, and the amazing thing about this is they were going to have it in the 1912 stock home olympics

686
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:44,800
 I think probably the first version not the second one and then the war happened and so the olympics got postponed

687
00:54:44,800 --> 00:54:49,280
 And in 1920 they were going to do it anyway, you know, they've decided okay

688
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:50,880
 We'll keep all the same sports

689
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:54,160
 But iceland decided that it only had a certain number of wrestlers

690
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:59,200
 And it needed them to impress the king of demarc who was visiting at the same time as the olympic games

691
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:02,080
 And so they decided we're not going to do this wrestling after all

692
00:55:02,080 --> 00:55:03,280
 We just want to

693
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:04,400
 Impress the king of demarc

694
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:07,600
 So it never became a worldwide sport that it might have done otherwise

695
00:55:07,600 --> 00:55:10,400
 And then in the end the king never came

696
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:14,400
 There was a

697
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:17,200
 Shanti not shanti but seesong when you were getting your grog

698
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:20,960
 So you would get your the amount of alcohol you were allowed each day

699
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:26,000
 They would give it you and they would sing while they were doing it and it was a song called Nancy Dawson

700
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:29,600
 And it's the tune that we now know as here we go around the mulberry bush

701
00:55:29,600 --> 00:55:37,040
 But it was all about Nancy Dawson who was a stage sort of performer an actress possibly a prostitute

702
00:55:37,040 --> 00:55:41,840
 And the i'm not going to say what the words are to the navy song about her but they are

703
00:55:41,840 --> 00:55:45,280
 Are they rude they are very rude. I think they say sex worker now dear

704
00:55:50,320 --> 00:55:54,160
 Um, they're meant to be quite easy, weren't they because you couldn't like not a sex worker

705
00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:57,360
 No, no

706
00:55:57,360 --> 00:56:02,320
 I meant the songs to sing

707
00:56:02,320 --> 00:56:09,120
 Um, because like some people can't sing names of registered competitive roller derby players include

708
00:56:09,120 --> 00:56:11,840
 skate bush

709
00:56:11,840 --> 00:56:13,840
 venus thigh trap

710
00:56:13,840 --> 00:56:16,240
 And weird al spankabitch

711
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:23,200
 I sort of thought what's like the rudest name that you can get to so I looked up the c-u-n-t word

712
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:27,600
 And I was heading down that way, but on the way I discovered the c-l-i-t word

713
00:56:27,600 --> 00:56:30,400
 And again, do you know how to say that?

714
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:35,840
 Go on go on Dan give us one clite, um

715
00:56:35,840 --> 00:56:44,000
 Okay, well in the c-l-i-t, uh, you've got uh catastrophe. Oh, yeah, please welcome to the ring clitosaurus rex

716
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:48,480
 Clitler is about to enter the ring

717
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:52,720
 And who's this coming up there a clitty clitty bang bang

718
00:56:52,720 --> 00:56:57,680
 That's really good

719
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,000
 Oh

720
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
 You

721
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
 You

722
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,000
 You

723
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,580
 (upbeat music)
