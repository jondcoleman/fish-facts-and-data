00:00:09,00:00:17,We have finished our summer live shows and we have loads of extra bits that I couldn't fit into the normal
00:00:17,00:00:20,15 minute to an hour episode of fish
00:00:20,00:00:27,Usually what we would do with those is we'd make them into a compilation and they would go for our club fish members
00:00:27,00:00:30,That's where all the compilations go these days
00:00:30,00:00:38,But seeing as they were the live shows that were coming to the end of summer and that we're all sleeping off our hangovers from episode
00:00:38,00:00:45,500 we thought we would put this up on our main feed now the thing is about these episodes is if you like the

00:02:19,00:02:23,Sally Phillips
00:02:23,00:02:27,Ella al-Shamahi everyone
00:02:27,00:02:31,It is Richard Osmar
00:02:31,00:02:41,Have you heard there's a great anecdote which I've been trying to prove but it's I don't think it's true. I was
00:02:42,00:02:45,"Actually, it's not true, and it's not relevant. Let's move on"
00:02:45,00:02:51,"Well, we got a lot quicker than normal didn't we? It's great"
00:02:51,00:02:54,"Usually I waste all our time, but I'm learning"
00:02:54,00:02:57,That's bullshit. That's one of your best stories done
00:02:57,00:03:02,"Quickly tell you guys about Alain bombard. Oh, yeah"
00:03:02,00:03:08,I was a French doctor and he is very unusual because he's one of the only people in history ever to shipwreck himself
00:03:08,00:03:11,"Okay, so this is amazing"
00:03:11,00:03:15,There were lots of people at the time being you know lots of shipwreck sailors who were dying each year
00:03:15,00:03:21,We're like when they're when their boats were shipwrecked and he wanted to prove that even if you had no food or water
00:03:21,00:03:25,There were there were ways you could survive so he set off from the canaries
00:03:25,00:03:32,With a sextant a tarpaulin a fishing rod and a sealed box of food and water which he was going to try really hard not to open
00:03:32,00:03:37,The self-control he must have had he suffered terribly like
00:03:39,00:03:44,"Yeah, he had no rain for three weeks and then storms snapped the mast of his dinghy"
00:03:44,00:03:47,Swordfish approached his rubber dinghy nose first
00:03:47,00:03:51,I know that's cool
00:03:51,00:03:54,"53 days later he bumped into a ship and they said oh, yeah"
00:03:54,00:03:57,"You're still 600 miles off course for where you're going, right?"
00:03:57,00:04:01,He had just become a father as well when he did this which I find
00:04:01,00:04:03,Like well at least some sleep
00:04:03,00:04:07,The length some people will go to
00:04:08,00:04:14,"So anyway, but anyway, so he he then he got on board this ship which picked him up after 53 days"
00:04:14,00:04:16,He had a small lunch of a fried egg
00:04:16,00:04:21,"Then got back on his dinghy and kept sailing towards Barbados, right and he made it there in the end"
00:04:21,00:04:27,"He did it eventually, but yeah, I just think what a what a self-experiment to do that to yourself extraordinary, but why?"
00:04:27,00:04:32,What's approved that apart from not to see your child and wife
00:04:32,00:04:35,I think they're taking 18 years to get
00:04:36,00:04:41,"Yeah, I think it was to prove what you could survive on if you could survive on fish or plankton"
00:04:41,00:04:46,"Which you you can do and you can do that without actually doing it. You could just say oh, I might eat fish today"
00:04:46,00:04:52,That's my self-control right there in a tin of food you can't open
00:04:52,00:05:00,Just out of curiosity have we have we been eating and drinking from the wrong end this whole time
00:05:00,00:05:03,Would there be would there be certain things?
00:05:03,00:05:05,Well
00:05:05,00:05:08,Because President Garfield was through his
00:05:08,00:05:14,Famously you've got a bit of your pipe left down
00:05:14,00:05:18,What better time to put it into practice a
00:05:18,00:05:22,Tutorial if you will I
00:05:22,00:05:29,Think if you have the option the mouth is a better option if we have no other option then the rectum is acceptable
00:05:29,00:05:32,"Just fluids though, so I mean if you're trying to absorb lots of nutrients"
00:05:32,00:05:36,"Okay, then you want then you know your stomach and your upper digestive system will do all that work"
00:05:36,00:05:39,So so it is a plan B very much so and I'll still try it
00:05:39,00:05:43,I was looking at people who
00:05:43,00:05:50,Died laughing this happened in 1920 and it was reported by an Australian newspaper called the Mudgee Guardian and Northwestern
00:05:50,00:05:53,"Representative okay, do you know it? Yeah? Yeah, that's my"
00:05:53,00:05:58,It's about a man called Arthur Cobcroft and I'm really I'm reading directly
00:05:59,00:06:03,So mr. Arthur Cobcroft died at his home in Lofter Street Saturday
00:06:03,00:06:11,He was reading at this 1920 he was reading an old newspaper of a 1915 date and was comparing the prices of various
00:06:11,00:06:13,Commodities with those of today
00:06:13,00:06:19,When he suddenly burst into laughter at the great difference he appeared to be unable to control himself and eventually collapsed and died
00:06:19,00:06:24,Commodity prices
00:06:24,00:06:26,They must have been so different
00:06:26,00:06:29,I'm laughing thinking about it now
00:06:29,00:06:33,It's amazing because I reckon the cost of living crisis isn't that funny today
00:06:33,00:06:38,"No, but for him, but if I say to you are like a Freddo used to be 10p"
00:06:38,00:06:42,"Yeah, I"
00:06:42,00:06:46,Was reading about when something goes wrong on stage
00:06:46,00:06:51,And so that got me into a whole territory of if someone is hurt as they're acting
00:06:52,00:07:00,What do you do and I found this thing that apparently it's a huge problem for paramedics when they're called to help someone
00:07:00,00:07:05,Who's really injured who's in a zombie movie because they arrive
00:07:05,00:07:09,They have no idea who the patient is because everyone is bleeding everyone's got
00:07:09,00:07:13,Even if they find the person who's really injured themselves
00:07:13,00:07:16,They just can't tell where the wound is because the amount of well
00:07:16,00:07:20,I broke a rib being chased by a zombie once did you yeah?
00:07:20,00:07:24,"Yeah, I was in London like one of these things where you pay to be chased by zombies"
00:07:24,00:07:27,Yeah
00:07:27,00:07:30,It does sound a bit like I
00:07:30,00:07:34,Was like watching a lot of American football at the time and the zombie was coming towards me
00:07:34,00:07:37,And I thought I'd do some amazing dodges past him
00:07:37,00:07:42,and I got nowhere near past him and he kind of tagged me and pushed me into a wall and I broke a rib and
00:07:42,00:07:47,They we had to go to like the A&E and there were quite a lot of people who'd had similar problems
00:07:47,00:07:50,And it was just like you say it was like being in mash
00:07:50,00:07:56,It's just people with arms hanging off. You didn't know what was real and what wasn't yeah
00:07:56,00:08:02,I found out that Bungay in East Anglia has the highest number of satanists in the UK. Oh
00:08:02,00:08:08,Today now I'd like to take issue with that would you because I think it's Bolsova in Derbyshire
00:08:10,00:08:17,How many has Bolsova got 17 17 17 17 in Bungay
00:08:17,00:08:22,"Okay, but it might be relative to population. I don't know how big Bungay is sounds tiny"
00:08:22,00:08:30,This Bolsova thing is from the census in 2011 when this was from the census. I bet it's is it later census mine
00:08:30,00:08:34,"Maybe I don't know 20 21. Yeah, but the in Bolsova"
00:08:34,00:08:39,"It was only 17 people who wrote satanist as their religion, but that was the highest per person"
00:08:39,00:08:44,"But highest concentration even Bristol only had 34 people who wrote satanist, but Bristol's huge"
00:08:44,00:08:47,So the Google article I saw said
00:08:47,00:08:51,Bungay in East Anglia and then the next one was Bronzebury
00:08:51,00:08:57,London which had 20 so the big gay be contingent of the alphabets
00:08:57,00:08:59,Beelzebub
00:08:59,00:09:02,The beast yeah
00:09:02,00:09:08,There was a footnote that said they thought Bungay my might been doing it as a kind of tourist attracting thing
00:09:09,00:09:14,Because they've got a big black dog. I can't know what it's called like a myth of a big black a satanic dog
00:09:14,00:09:21,"I'm okay, man. Yeah, and they're trying to push that. It's worked. I mean, we're all talking about Bungay all the time"
00:09:21,00:09:25,Or did you know there's a pantomime horse arrest in Tesco's
00:09:25,00:09:36,When it was when it was found that the Tesco's budget brand everyday value burgers contain 29% horse meat
00:09:37,00:09:40,"Yeah, pantomime horse went to protest in Tesco's"
00:09:40,00:09:43,Crying going mommy
00:09:43,00:09:47,And it was led away
00:09:47,00:09:50,And it was never seen
00:09:50,00:09:58,Here's a good quick little tip if you meet someone who's Dutch and they say to you I fuck horses
00:09:58,00:10:01,They don't
00:10:02,00:10:09,"Not necessarily you've got it. Oh, I can't confirm for certain. Yeah, so is that Dutch does it sound okay means breeding?"
00:10:09,00:10:15,"Yeah, they breed horses. Yeah, and there supposedly was a story where the Dutch foreign minister was introduced to JFK"
00:10:15,00:10:19,"And he said hi how we knew so don't very good. Well, what are your hobbies? I fuck horses and"
00:10:19,00:10:23,Why did he only say that one word in Dutch and the rest of it?
00:10:23,00:10:29,"That's where I also questioned the anecdotes. Yeah, but it does stand I looked up the translation"
00:10:29,00:10:35,"Yeah, and fok is for breeding. So yeah, again, you'd never hear that in that kind unless horses"
00:10:35,00:10:37,I didn't look up horses and look up if they say that in Dutch
00:10:37,00:10:40,Should we move on?
00:10:40,00:10:49,So one person who did slightly pioneer the idea of living underwater it was Jacques Cousteau Jacques Cousteau you all probably
00:10:49,00:10:57,Know him. He's he's had the calypso and he was one of the greatest ocean. Sorry. I don't you know the dance. No
00:10:58,00:11:03,"You know the ice cream using it with a calypso. Yeah, he's one of the greatest"
00:11:03,00:11:10,Oceanographers of all time and he kind of pioneered documentary making in the field of immersive and you follow a team and
00:11:10,00:11:14,The life aquatic by Wes Anderson is very much based on the story of Jacques Cousteau
00:11:14,00:11:20,But on a scientific level he also invented or co-invented the aqualung which is why we're able to go diving
00:11:20,00:11:24,So that was Jacques Cousteau and then one of the other things he did was this thing called the con shells
00:11:24,00:11:32,Which are the continental shells which were habitable zones down in the ocean and continental shelf to was this big looking starfish
00:11:32,00:11:34,kind of housing unit and
00:11:34,00:11:37,He lived in it with his crew for a number of days
00:11:37,00:11:42,They had a parrot that came down and lived with them as well because that in a sort of slightly dark sense
00:11:42,00:11:46,It was like the canary in the mountain. You know something was wrong with the levels of oxygen
00:11:46,00:11:49,"Okay, parrot would know first and so they could get out of there"
00:11:49,00:11:54,So he set a record for the longest anyone's been down there and then his son Fabian Cousteau
00:11:55,00:12:00,So he lived down there and held the record for the longest anyone's been under the ocean for quite a while
00:12:00,00:12:03,And then it got taken over by a professor and a student
00:12:03,00:12:07,But he invented a shark submarine. Have you seen this?
00:12:07,00:12:12,This is this is incredible. It's the submarine in the shape of a shark
00:12:12,00:12:18,So the idea is that he can observe sharks while being one of them. It's a one person submersible
00:12:18,00:12:22,"No, he has to be in a diving suit while he's in it because water flows all the way through"
00:12:22,00:12:29,He has to drive the submarine while laying down in the shark and his elbows are steering it as he goes
00:12:29,00:12:33,"Why his elbows? What's he doing with the sun? Sorry, he's not his elbows steering with his hands"
00:12:33,00:12:34,"Okay, thank you"
00:12:34,00:12:40,"He has a needless layer of complication for an otherwise flawless idea. He's on his phone, isn't he and he's just like"
00:12:40,00:12:47,"I was looking at in British elections, you know, there's that thing of always on election night a general election night"
00:12:47,00:12:52,There's a kind of who gets their their ballot counted first and it's which constituencies also
00:12:52,00:12:57,It's usually like Sunderland versus Newcastle Sunderland and Newcastle and you mean like a race to get
00:12:57,00:13:03,"Yeah, I was reading about Sunderland's methods for ensuring they stay at the top of their game. Yeah, and they're amazing"
00:13:03,00:13:08,So well we're going with it's kind of a tradition now and they've like they've done it
00:13:08,00:13:09,They've really gone into detail
00:13:09,00:13:14,So they hire bank tellers because they're very good at flipping through lots and lots of paper very quickly like individual bits of paper
00:13:14,00:13:20,They use lighter paper for their ballot sheets because it's slightly easier to count fast
00:13:20,00:13:23,So they switch from a hundred gsm to 80 gsm
00:13:23,00:13:31,"Yeah, they do obviously they do practices like they practically dress rehearsals with the students who are running holding the ballot boxes"
00:13:31,00:13:35,And they are like they say you're gonna be filmed. You're gonna be you need to be you know careful
00:13:35,00:13:37,you don't want to drop those that'll be a disaster and
00:13:37,00:13:44,"They play but always wins in that constituency, right? I think they do I think they always win"
00:13:44,00:13:51,"I guess they would yeah, but you remember like I always watch the election night and they all the results come in and I"
00:13:51,00:13:55,Only stay up for Sunderland the Newcastle a hundred percent labor and then I go to bed
00:13:55,00:14:03,"Always slightly disappointed when I wake up. I get it. Yeah, you can get woolen coffins these days. I believe this is very"
00:14:03,00:14:08,Little price for anyone who can guess the headline that was used on the story announcing us in 2011
00:14:08,00:14:13,Take your time that you're allowed woolen coffins now. Yeah as a cool woolen coffin that's been launched
00:14:14,00:14:16,Gonna have to hurry you
00:14:16,00:14:22,"No, no, that's all no, that's all believe silent bits of podcasts a very popular anyone in the audience"
00:14:22,00:14:25,This is too tough a quiz handy anyone
00:14:25,00:14:30,What was a burial was good famous phrase cozy bear went with
00:14:30,00:14:33,rest in fleece
00:14:33,00:14:39,"Mine very nice, but lovely"
00:14:39,00:14:43,"Yeah, you can be you can be buried in it or it can be cremated"
00:14:43,00:14:48,It's the same in the way you can get cardboard coffins wool coffins willow coffins banana leaf coffins
00:14:48,00:14:54,Or you can now be wrapped in a shroud as we used to be and there's a big movement a natural burial movement
00:14:54,00:14:56,Which is because there are so many
00:14:56,00:15:01,"Horrible chemicals and a lot of funeral processes, especially if you are embalmed"
00:15:01,00:15:04,It's very bad for the environment for your body to go into the ground full of chemicals
00:15:04,00:15:09,"Right, so if you have a biodegradable coffin, then you can be buried in like what in a natural burial"
00:15:09,00:15:14,It's basically a field that someone's agreed to have people buried in can you get wicker? Yeah wicker
00:15:14,00:15:19,"Yeah, and you can also get one that's made of like a mushroom fungus that will start to decompose your body faster"
00:15:19,00:15:22,"That is cool, and so this is really important"
00:15:22,00:15:28,I've talked before a big talk of planning your funeral and advance care planning is big thing that you should write this down now
00:15:28,00:15:35,"Otherwise, you're gonna get wrapped in that wool suit. Right. I just like to put it that because this is being recorded and we'll go out"
00:15:35,00:15:37,I do not want to be eaten by mushrooms when okay
00:15:38,00:15:43,Do you want banana leaves or wicker or wool? I'll be putting a big wicker cage and burned by some
00:15:43,00:15:50,And probably some people be dancing around in white in the situation. That's gonna be an amazing podcast when it comes out
00:15:50,00:15:56,One of the suffragettes this was Anne Hunt she walked into the National Portrait Gallery and
00:15:56,00:16:01,She stopped in front of a portrait of Thomas Carlisle who's one of the founders
00:16:01,00:16:07,Painted by Millay and she slashed it. It was a really famous thing that she did
00:16:07,00:16:14,There was only one member of staff who was suspicious. I was guy called David Wilson and the first time she walked in
00:16:14,00:16:16,He wasn't that suspicious. He thought she was American
00:16:16,00:16:23,Apparently he thought she was American because she was looking so closely at the pictures
00:16:23,00:16:27,Apparently that's what Americans do but then the second day she came back in again
00:16:27,00:16:35,And David Wilson said they she couldn't be American because no American would have paid the six pence entrance fee twice over
00:16:36,00:16:39,So it's like that must be someone that's up to no good
00:16:39,00:16:43,Was she coming back? Had she already slashed something? No the first time she went in was to kind of
00:16:43,00:16:49,"Yeah, so there were lots of sort of famous incidents like particular flash points where for example"
00:16:49,00:16:54,Mrs. Pankhurst was going to speak at an event and then and you know the police didn't want it to happen
00:16:54,00:16:59,And so that became a course celebrity. So there was an event called the Battle of Glasgow
00:16:59,00:17:05,The Mrs. Pankhurst was going to Glasgow to speak and the police did not want her to appear
00:17:05,00:17:06,They didn't want her to speak
00:17:06,00:17:12,There were 50 police constables in the basement of the building where she was billed to appear all the tickets have been sold
00:17:12,00:17:15,You know huge presence like people checking everyone on the door
00:17:15,00:17:22,Suddenly Mrs. Pankhurst appears on stage out of nowhere and it turns out she just come in as a punter with a ticket
00:17:22,00:17:25,Sat by the platform and then gets up and start speaking
00:17:25,00:17:28,"So all the police start coming up from the basement because they're you know, they're activated"
00:17:28,00:17:31,Meanwhile
00:17:31,00:17:35,25 of the suffragette bodyguards get their clubs out and start trying to beat the police up
00:17:35,00:17:39,"Yeah, you know, so you've got 25 suffragettes with clubs 50 policemen with their truncheons"
00:17:39,00:17:43,One of the suffragettes shot a policeman in the chest point blank with a blank bullet
00:17:43,00:17:45,So it wasn't it was just a kind of surprise rather than I
00:17:45,00:17:49,Hope she said that
00:17:49,00:17:57,And then playing clothes detectives tried to get onto the platform when Mrs. Pankhurst is still speaking at this point
00:17:57,00:18:00,"Yeah, she's still delivering her speech the playing clothes detectives are trying to climb onto the platform"
00:18:00,00:18:05,It turns out the floral garlands all the way around the platform are barbed wire. They've been disguised
00:18:05,00:18:11,There are old ladies now beating the police with their umbrellas as they're trying to fight the truncheon
00:18:11,00:18:15,We're like it just sounds like an insane scene. Who's listening to the speech at this point?
00:18:15,00:18:23,Weird moment today I was researching crisps and I found out in Japan at the moment
00:18:23,00:18:28,There's a trend that's going on and then it turns out this is going global now to eat crisps using chopsticks
00:18:29,00:18:35,So that you don't get the oil on your fingers as you are doing the other work that you're doing right if you're eating
00:18:35,00:18:42,So I was literally eating a bag of crisps as I was researching that fact and my fingers absolutely was sticky on the on the
00:18:42,00:18:49,"The Mac sort of mouse bits, you know like keep all keep it. Yeah. Yeah, the keep that like the you know"
00:18:49,00:18:53,"The hand mouse thing the keypad. Yeah, well the keypads the mouse and the mean the mouse"
00:18:53,00:18:56,The tracker the trackpad
00:18:57,00:18:59,The trackpad
00:18:59,00:19:01,"Gosh, it's like living in the future, isn't it?"
00:19:01,00:19:07,I found myself reading a piece about historical novels by a radical
00:19:07,00:19:13,"James Forester, I just want to quote from this article. He wrote about ten years ago and listen to this"
00:19:13,00:19:16,"He was because he reads a lot and he I think he wrote historical novels, too"
00:19:16,00:19:25,One highly acclaimed and commercially successful recent historical novel had on page three the statement that there were no priests within a three-day ride
00:19:25,00:19:32,Taking into consideration the time of year and the location of this statement. I calculated that there were between five and eight thousand priests
00:19:32,00:19:39,Within a three-day ride in that year. I could not carry on reading
00:19:39,00:19:52,Children are quite weirdly good at lying so or rather they're good
00:19:53,00:19:58,So adults are very bad at telling when children are like this is the thing and the reason for that they can only work
00:19:58,00:20:02,It out about the same as I'm guessing on at like a 54% of the time
00:20:02,00:20:07,So not much better than chance really and the reason for that there are lots of experiments and it's because adults assume that children
00:20:07,00:20:11,Lie like adults do and they assume that children's faces
00:20:11,00:20:15,Move in the same ways that adults do but basically there have been a load of experiments
00:20:15,00:20:21,Which assumed that children are not proficient liars and in fact the problem is that children just look guilty quite a lot of the time
00:20:22,00:20:28,Like because you talk to a young child though. They might divert their eyes. They might fidget. They might be incoherent
00:20:28,00:20:35,They look they look like they look like they're hiding something and that's so adults think they're lying when they may will not be so yeah
00:20:35,00:20:41,"I think I look permanently guilty. It makes me a bad liar, but it also makes me a really bad truth teller"
00:20:41,00:20:45,That's the problem because I look like I'm lying whatever so any lie I tell I'm gonna get cortex
00:20:45,00:20:49,I look like I'm lying and any time I tell the truth. No one believes me because I look like I'm lying
00:20:50,00:20:54,It's very difficult. That's why I have to have the computer in front of me on point this
00:20:54,00:21:01,One of the reasons that we have X as the X man and their
00:21:01,00:21:05,X-ray and stuff like that is because day car
00:21:05,00:21:09,"Used X to mean an unknown in algebra. Yeah, wasn't it?"
00:21:09,00:21:15,He decided to use X Y and Z and the story goes that the reason he did it is because the printer
00:21:15,00:21:19,Who was doing his books and I got loads of X's Y's and Z's left over because no words have
00:21:19,00:21:22,So I might as well use them
00:21:22,00:21:26,But it turns out that because he's French actually X is quite a common
00:21:26,00:21:31,Relatively common in French and it might have been because they just had lots of X's because X is quite common
00:21:31,00:21:35,"But yeah, but without those without day car. We might not have the X man"
00:21:35,00:21:40,"We might have the a man or the other be man or whatever. Oh, wow. We wouldn't have the seaman"
00:21:40,00:21:45,Probably not
00:21:46,00:21:51,So I was I was looking into things that are named after people and I was thinking I was reasoning that there must be something
00:21:51,00:21:55,Which is the most famous thing that people don't know is named after a person
00:21:55,00:22:02,So we've said before like shrapnel is named after a bloke who was called general Henry shrapnel
00:22:02,00:22:05,I think I said the nachos were named after a guy called
00:22:05,00:22:12,So we've done a few of these before and I the cardigan do people know it was named after the seventh Earl of cardigan
00:22:12,00:22:17,"Okay, that is known because I read an article claiming that he was wearing one while he led the charge of the library cage"
00:22:17,00:22:24,"I thought that can't that can't be right there would have been a uniform because it feels too. Yeah, yeah"
00:22:24,00:22:27,"Well, like pushing his merch during war"
00:22:27,00:22:35,"Yeah, I mean, yeah, it is named after him, but yeah, I think and it was during the Battle of Balaclava"
00:22:35,00:22:37,That's the thing that we don't know
00:22:37,00:22:43,"Yeah, and then cravat go back to croats because croats were those yeah, and"
00:22:43,00:22:47,"Slaves were sloths. I mean, that's not quite eponyms"
00:22:47,00:22:51,It's the kind of toponyms but and and I'm really sorry to always lower the tone
00:22:51,00:22:58,But I don't know that bugger is actually a riff on Bulgarian because there were these Bulgarian sects in the 11th
00:22:58,00:23:04,Sects in the 11th century there was supposed to get up to strange sex. So that's where bugger
00:23:05,00:23:08,"Yeah, that's kind of topping in there wasn't it really not an eponym"
00:23:08,00:23:12,Strictly speaking
00:23:12,00:23:20,In 1996 the Swedish Navy admitted that they had found a huge amount of evidence of Russian submarines operating in their waters
00:23:20,00:23:24,"Right really serious, you know post-Cold War threatening security environment"
00:23:24,00:23:29,And there had been six thousand incidents a huge number reported from 1981 to 1994
00:23:29,00:23:32,It turns out that what they had been hearing was largely
00:23:32,00:23:35,Otters splashing
00:23:35,00:23:37,Playful otters splashing in the water
00:23:37,00:23:42,There about one in a thousand claims would was likely to be a submarine and the rest was just random
00:23:42,00:23:51,"They found out that it was farting fish as well, didn't they? Yeah, they communicate by farting"
00:23:51,00:23:57,"In fact, we have this fact so qi, which is herring communicate by farting"
00:23:57,00:24:01,"Yes, and we tweet it about once a year just so that everyone tweets Richard herring to go"
00:24:01,00:24:03,"Oh, I didn't know you"
00:24:03,00:24:07,He hates us
00:24:07,00:24:12,I couldn't imagine so the thing I want to mention about protests is to do with another quiz show which is mastermind
00:24:12,00:24:17,And the first question ever was about protests and it was about a painting by Picasso
00:24:17,00:24:21,Which was a protest about the bombing by Spanish planes on a village and the question was
00:24:21,00:24:25,What year when the event took place was the inspiration for the painting?
00:24:25,00:24:28,The answer was 1937
00:24:28,00:24:32,"The answer was 1937, but the question was about German planes not Spain"
00:24:32,00:24:36,So the first ever question on mastermind was incorrect
00:24:36,00:24:38,Yeah
00:24:38,00:24:40,So how shit is mastermind
00:24:40,00:24:46,I just I just feel like it's qi and countdown on stage together. Let's shit on someone
00:24:46,00:24:52,"What do you reckon soothe this shit? Yeah, let's get some headlines. That's it. Yes. Wait"
00:24:55,00:24:58,"Oh, I don't want to diss any other shit. Yeah, that was vicious. Um"
00:24:58,00:25:05,"Just on religion while we're there, um, there's been a few naked religions in the past"
00:25:05,00:25:07,So the adomites
00:25:07,00:25:11,They were a sect in north Africa in the second third and fourth centuries
00:25:11,00:25:14,That used always worn no clothes during the religious ceremonies
00:25:14,00:25:18,The idea being that they were going back to the Garden of Eden before we had clothes
00:25:18,00:25:20,And this was the best way to get close to God
00:25:21,00:25:26,Now it became big again in the Czech Republic in Czechia in 14th century
00:25:26,00:25:30,And people who were adomites then would go naked through the towns and villages
00:25:30,00:25:35,So they would everyone take their clothes off and they would go through the town saying come and join our gang
00:25:35,00:25:41,"You know, we're the we're the closest to Jesus. Conga basically you're describing a naked conga"
00:25:41,00:25:44,"Sure. Let's call it a naked. Well, they did do a lot of naked dances"
00:25:44,00:25:48,They would have a fire and they would do naked dances around it and the idea was
00:25:49,00:25:55,That they rejected a lot of the things in the catholic church and a lot of people think that they were like the precursors to the Protestant revolution
00:25:55,00:25:59,"So it was like, you know, they was with the first people really to kind of go against the church"
00:25:59,00:26:02,And then it kind of built up and built up in central europe
00:26:02,00:26:08,But it carried all of the Cromwell trimmed a lot of that stuff away. Didn't he before it came up with puritanism
00:26:08,00:26:12,"Yeah, sorry and then it carried on and in the early us"
00:26:12,00:26:17,They had some adomites there and I was reading about one clergyman who was writing about them and he said um
00:26:18,00:26:20,About these people who were in church and were naked the whole time
00:26:20,00:26:27,If the planets of venus reigned in their lower parts making them swell for pride or rather for lust
00:26:27,00:26:33,Then the clerk with his long stick shall strike down the presumptuous flesh
00:26:33,00:26:36,So basically
00:26:36,00:26:38,"If you yeah, you would yeah"
00:26:38,00:26:43,And he said that on one occasion there was a woman who made a congregation member
00:26:44,00:26:51,Rise in such an unmeasurable manner that the old clerk was forced to use both hands to elate his courage
00:26:51,00:26:58,At which the prophesizer was in such pain that the whole house could not hold him and he said he would kill the clerk
00:26:58,00:27:03,And basically this guy just started whacking his genitals with his stick
00:27:03,00:27:08,He attacked that guy and basically they only just stopped him from killing the clerk
00:27:09,00:27:14,But this guy said he wasn't bothered because it was in church. God will look after him and it didn't matter if he killed the clerk
00:27:14,00:27:17,Because it was naked. It would all be fine
00:27:17,00:27:21,"It feels like we feels like pants is just easier, isn't it?"
00:27:21,00:27:28,So burrowing owls they have lots of piles of poo outside the nest and it's cow dung and bison dung and all of this
00:27:28,00:27:31,And then they just stand by the poo
00:27:31,00:27:35,And wait they just go into kind of sentry position and just stand there looking very still
00:27:36,00:27:39,And what scientists reckon is that they're fishing for dung beetles
00:27:39,00:27:46,Oh freshish dung and dung beetles are really interested in burrowing owls love eating the the dung beetles
00:27:46,00:27:52,And so they'll just stand and wait and let the dung beetles approach. Isn't that crazy? They're basically they're basically fishing
00:27:52,00:27:56,"Like they're land fishing. Yeah. No, I got it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah"
00:27:56,00:28:02,"I try to find a uh, if there was another naughty barbie, you know"
00:28:02,00:28:08,Kind of like the origins of barbie being a cool girl and I managed to find one which was the pole dancing barbie
00:28:08,00:28:14,"This was a one-off because it was part of a thing in japan called hebo con which was you know, like robot wars"
00:28:14,00:28:21,"This was anti robot wars. This was a robot wars where everyone's specific negotiations. No, no"
00:28:21,00:28:24,You you have to summit
00:28:24,00:28:27,robot model un
00:28:27,00:28:32,You had to bring a very bad robot basically it had to be terrible and so
00:28:32,00:28:35,The worse it was the better you got in the competition
00:28:35,00:28:41,"Okay, you were so there were 31 entrants and barbie doll that was entered was a attacking"
00:28:41,00:28:46,"Through pole dancing barbie, but the other ones that it went up. How did she attack you with a pole dance?"
00:28:46,00:28:48,Did she spin round and kick you in the head?
00:28:48,00:28:52,I think so because I couldn't find any photos because this was in 2013 and I think
00:28:52,00:28:56,So
00:28:56,00:29:01,"No, so I but it's you know was a small thing that happened in japan the winner was a robot that was so sturdy"
00:29:01,00:29:05,That no one could knock it over so it just stood so the other things walked into it
00:29:05,00:29:10,"Okay, that's the best one was the uh the person who got a special acknowledgement"
00:29:10,00:29:16,Was one person a lady who accidentally left her robot on the train and then just went for a beer instead
00:29:16,00:29:19,And they were like that level of shitness is so great. We want to
00:29:19,00:29:22,Commend you with a special honor there. That's awesome
00:29:22,00:29:28,But yeah pole dancing barbie the only one time in a anti robot war japanese competition hebo con very cool
00:29:28,00:29:33,"Yeah, there is a thing called the bubble babba challenge. This is at the voxki river in russia"
00:29:33,00:29:37,"So it's near st. Petersburg. Uh, and it's a race"
00:29:37,00:29:39,a
00:29:39,00:29:43,"Kind of a rafting race, but instead of a raft you have a sex doll"
00:29:43,00:29:46,"Uh, it began in 2003"
00:29:46,00:29:50,Anyone's allowed to enter but you have to have a compulsory alcohol test before you start
00:29:50,00:29:54,"Oh, yeah, we don't want to we don't want to make this seem tawdry or unprofessional"
00:29:57,00:29:59,And in 2006
00:29:59,00:30:02,That guy riding the sex doll down the river's had a shandy
00:30:02,00:30:08,The most exciting of the bubble babba challenge
00:30:08,00:30:11,Sex doll races was in 2006
00:30:11,00:30:13,So all the races jumped into the water
00:30:13,00:30:18,And there was a really really strong wind and that meant that almost all the sex dolls blew away
00:30:18,00:30:23,And so you've just got all these rushing mostly guys in the water just sort of without their sex dolls
00:30:24,00:30:28,And there was only one person the guy called osipov who reached the finish line
00:30:28,00:30:30,But he was disqualified
00:30:30,00:30:35,Because the jury had noticed signs of recent sexual activity on the doll
00:30:35,00:30:40,Which was very much banned
00:30:40,00:30:46,"I've got another but we've got another barbie thing. Okay. Yeah barbie has uh, officially"
00:30:46,00:30:49,"Not part of any political party, right? So there's a"
00:30:49,00:30:53,Various reasons for that. She's been a presidential candidate every election since 1992
00:30:54,00:30:56,"Uh, much like hillary clinton"
00:30:56,00:31:04,"Um, not fair. Um, but she got in a she got in a beef with donald j trump bar barbie and donald j trump had a had a"
00:31:04,00:31:10,"Beef at the last election. Um, because donald j trump tweeted. There's a thing called voter barbie. And it's doing courage"
00:31:10,00:31:12,What do you keep saying j in his name?
00:31:12,00:31:19,"Oh, sorry. That's his junior. I'm talking about donald trump jr. Okay. I believe. Yeah. Yeah, okay. Can't be the senior"
00:31:20,00:31:24,"I mean, they're both such they're both such different. Yes"
00:31:24,00:31:31,"Well, I don't know who I don't know which of them said this. I think it was jr. But basically one of the trumps"
00:31:31,00:31:37,Uh tweeted voter barbie must be a democrat because she's already wearing an i voted sticker
00:31:37,00:31:39,And yet she's got another ballot in her hand
00:31:39,00:31:45,And matel had to reply barbie is not and never has been affiliated with a political party
00:31:45,00:31:51,To an official statement saying she's not a democrat. Yeah. Yeah. Wow. I think she is though clearly clearly
00:31:51,00:31:55,Can I tell you one more dueling method that happened? Yeah
00:31:55,00:32:01,So basically the you know the thing about you turn back to back and then you walk and then you there are various different methods in different
00:32:01,00:32:05,Countries walk ten paces turn around shoot. Sorry. Yes. So the back. That's french basically
00:32:05,00:32:09,"Um, and there is a much more fun variant which has another french name. It's called avalante"
00:32:09,00:32:13,You face each other. Can we do the fun duel?
00:32:15,00:32:19,"There was people really relished it, you know, a certain kind of person really seemed to enjoy it"
00:32:19,00:32:25,"So there's a variant called avalante where you face each other, right and you start walking towards each other"
00:32:25,00:32:29,You can either of you can fire whenever you like but if you miss
00:32:29,00:32:32,You have to stand still and wait for the other
00:32:32,00:32:35,Guy to shoot right. I know and that feels tense
00:32:35,00:32:41,I thought you were going to say that you're standing right in front of each other and then you walk backwards away from each other
00:32:41,00:32:44,And then you're just hoping someone's not kneeling down behind you
00:32:45,00:32:47,That's amazing really
00:32:47,00:32:52,"It used to be in the Olympics, didn't it pistol dueling? Yeah, 1906"
00:32:52,00:32:57,"It was one of the categories. It wasn't a medal one, but you would you would"
00:32:57,00:33:01,So it was it was a thing that was done there because the winner would be dead. Yeah
00:33:01,00:33:08,Just pick him up. I'm gonna put a silver medal on
00:33:08,00:33:13,But that would be the there was like an intercalary games wasn't there in 1906
00:33:13,00:33:18,It wasn't the main game and they used wax bullets and the idea was you would just see who got hit first
00:33:18,00:33:25,And you had the sort of glass plate that was over your face and but it was done as a proper thing with spectators around and everything
00:33:25,00:33:26,"Yeah, it was very exciting"
00:33:26,00:33:30,Have we said before that I think nasa found the oldest known rock
00:33:30,00:33:34,The oldest known earth rock was on the moon and then brought back to earth. Yes
00:33:34,00:33:37,It was called big bertha was the name of the rock
00:33:38,00:33:43,"Was it yeah, it was yeah, they named it after a I think a gun from the first world war"
00:33:43,00:33:48,So they brought that back and it was the first earth meteorite ever found on another body as in the first
00:33:48,00:33:53,"Like meteor out if you like, you know the first like bit of earth that it hit somewhere else"
00:33:53,00:33:58,Wasn't that the moon created when uh an asteroid hit the earth and there's a little splash. So they say so they say yeah
00:33:58,00:34:01,"No, I'm not sure I buy it. Yeah"
00:34:01,00:34:05,Pixar didn't happen. There's actually a strong theory that it is hollow
00:34:07,00:34:09,"So, uh"
00:34:09,00:34:12,Is this the moon cave theory
00:34:12,00:34:18,"Oh, yeah, I haven't heard it called that before but yeah, I suppose. Yeah, because supposedly when you hit it, it rings like a bell"
00:34:18,00:34:23,"So is it artificial? Is it real? Listen, you mean when a meteorite hits a knife? You just go"
00:34:23,00:34:28,"No, when they did drilling on the moon they they they specifically tried to find out because you can do"
00:34:28,00:34:30,You can do well
00:34:30,00:34:35,You can do seismic tests on the moon to see what the composure is on the inside right and it was completely empty apparently and so
00:34:37,00:34:43,"I'm joking. Hannah. I'm joking. I promise. Thank you. Yeah. Yeah. Thank you. Have you ever been in a diamond mine in your adventures, Hannah?"
00:34:43,00:34:46,"No, I haven't. I wonder what that's like. Hmm"
00:34:46,00:34:52,I see we've run out of facts and entered speculation territory
00:34:52,00:34:55,God
00:34:55,00:35:01,And you've mentioned oscar the hypno dog before on the podcast. Can you remember what that was oscar the hypno dog was a
00:35:01,00:35:04,Labrador who was a hypnot who was hypnotically trained
00:35:05,00:35:11,And went and like went missing and there were signs put up all over the country saying do not look at this talk
00:35:11,00:35:16,Is that it? That's it. Yeah. Yeah. Basically
00:35:16,00:35:19,He's dangerous
00:35:19,00:35:24,We have mentioned that but what I'd never heard before was about puffy the hypno cat
00:35:24,00:35:28,Amazing. Uh puffy the hypno cat was in the 1940s in america
00:35:28,00:35:33,There was a guy who owned a bar and he said that puffy was sitting on the end of a nightclub bar
00:35:33,00:35:37,And a couple of girls came up to him and I didn't really pay attention what happened
00:35:37,00:35:41,But suddenly a girl was simply out on her feet. She simply wasn't from drinking
00:35:41,00:35:44,I'm something of a hypnotist myself
00:35:44,00:35:50,And I realized she was in a hypnotic trance and it turned out that this cat had been hypnotizing people
00:35:50,00:35:53,in this guy's bar
00:35:53,00:35:59,And he started then training the cats to stare at people really really fixedly to try and hypnotize them
00:36:00,00:36:08,And puffy became really really famous and in 1945 the american feline society called her the king of all cats
00:36:08,00:36:11,Um because she was bringing in money for war bonds
00:36:11,00:36:16,So you would go into the bar and you would pay some money to be hypnotized by the cat
00:36:16,00:36:18,"And then you know, they get the money for the war"
00:36:18,00:36:24,"And by the end of her life, she was credited with hypnotizing over 300 people"
00:36:24,00:36:29,Always for benign purposes. I just well I spent all my money on tinned tuner
00:36:30,00:36:32,It's so weird
00:36:32,00:36:36,Just left it open around the place probably probably nothing
00:36:36,00:36:41,And you Hannah you're such a skeptic you probably don't even believe that story's true
00:36:41,00:36:45,Actually that one I'm really behind
00:36:45,00:36:52,"One of us on this panel might be slightly harder to hypnotize than the other three. Oh, okay, can we guess it?"
00:36:52,00:36:56,um
00:36:56,00:37:02,Is it done because of his dubious questioning techniques? It's not done because of his dubious questioning techniques
00:37:02,00:37:09,I feel like Hannah with her skepticism. It's not Hannah with her dubious skepticism thing
00:37:09,00:37:14,Is it Andy with his lack of ability to talk to people at parties? It's not me
00:37:14,00:37:20,James for being so fucking judgmental about the other three people on the panel
00:37:25,00:37:31,"It's james, but not for that reason not for that reason it's because so james you have aphantasia, right? Oh, right, okay"
00:37:31,00:37:36,James can't you say what it is? I just can't picture things in my head can't picture things in your head
00:37:36,00:37:39,"Yeah, and that might make it harder to hypnotize you. It's there was a well"
00:37:39,00:37:46,"This is from the uk hypnosis convention, which sounds amazing last year's events included recreational erotic hypnosis"
00:37:46,00:37:51,"Uh, and aphantasia. What is it and why should we even care slightly?"
00:37:53,00:37:55,Slightly barbed
00:37:55,00:38:02,I don't know much time we got I got very deep in the weeds on people who want to be heroes and do bad stuff
00:38:02,00:38:09,"Oh, yeah, yeah, go for it. Uh, have you heard of the hero complex? No. No, so it's not quite a psychological disorder"
00:38:09,00:38:13,"It's not in the diagnostic manuals, but it's like talked about by psychologists"
00:38:13,00:38:17,It's a thing where it's sometimes known as a vanity crime where people are desperate to be the hero
00:38:17,00:38:21,So they'll do something bad so they can then rescue people
00:38:21,00:38:24,"Like I'd mug you but then beat myself up. Yeah, exactly"
00:38:24,00:38:30,"Exactly that and hand yourself in I guess is the idea. Yeah, yeah, yeah, but I rough myself up a bit first"
00:38:30,00:38:34,Why stop that a bit of a lifetime?
00:38:34,00:38:40,But like there's there's quite a lot of case studies the really famous one's 1984 an la pd
00:38:40,00:38:44,police officer called jimmy wade pierce and heroically discovered and diffused a pipe bomb
00:38:44,00:38:48,On an airport bus carrying the turkish olympic team in la
00:38:48,00:38:54,And people saw him running down like the airport holding a pipe bomb dismantling and throwing over his shoulder and shouting get out
00:38:54,00:39:00,You know like proper like bruce willis stuff and it turned out he had planted it there
00:39:00,00:39:05,Because he wanted to be the hero because he wanted to transfer into a different department and his boss hated him
00:39:05,00:39:09,And he thought the only way i'm getting out is if I get a commendation
00:39:09,00:39:15,And he failed the polygraph and he ended up with 1500 hours of community service and it became a bit of a thing
00:39:15,00:39:19,"But everyone was like all right well no one was hurt fair enough, but then there's some really bad ones"
00:39:19,00:39:25,"So there's a thing called firefighter arson, which is a serious problem. Yeah, you heard of this. Yeah, yeah, yeah"
00:39:25,00:39:29,There are a hundred firefighters every year arrested for arson
00:39:29,00:39:33,"In america alone. There's a million firefighters. So it's a tiny statistic, but a hundred people"
00:39:33,00:39:40,Most of them are young men age 16 to 30. I read a whole report issued in 2003 by the u.s. government's national fire administration
00:39:40,00:39:41,I got very deep
00:39:41,00:39:43,There are six primary motives excitement
00:39:44,00:39:49,Vandalism revenge profit political terrorism hiding evidence of a crime
00:39:49,00:39:53,And it's a really big problem for a small subset
00:39:53,00:39:57,And there's a guy who's a tenancy fire chief. He's set fire to his own fire station
00:39:57,00:40:04,"Wow, he caused the three-quarters of a million dollars of damage and when released he then set fire to a car dealership"
00:40:04,00:40:09,And he did it for the sexual thrill. This is why we need pawn hub
00:40:09,00:40:14,Yeah sexual sexual thrill he gay got off on the uniting the worst ones john or
00:40:14,00:40:20,He was from glendale fire service in california in 1991 was found to have planned eight arson attacks on shops
00:40:20,00:40:24,And was suspected of many more. He killed four people in these fires. It's really really horrible
00:40:24,00:40:26,His main job at the glendale service
00:40:26,00:40:29,Chief arson investigator
00:40:29,00:40:30,Wow
00:40:30,00:40:35,Hover story and so they tailed him for months and every time there was a fire investigating conference
00:40:35,00:40:37,There would be fires in the local area
00:40:37,00:40:41,And he was possibly alleged to have set 2000 fires
00:40:41,00:40:43,Making the most prolific american arsonist
00:40:43,00:40:49,Unrecord but one of the clues that they detected about him is that he had written a novel about a fireman who sets fires
00:40:49,00:40:53,It's like a serious thing and
00:40:53,00:40:57,"I'm so sorry to get stuck on this, but I then watched fireman sam with my four-year-old dog"
00:40:57,00:41:02,"So, yeah, and I went does he do that? Hang on a second for sexual thrills. No"
00:41:02,00:41:07,I work for cbbs. I don't want to get cancelled
00:41:08,00:41:13,But like I realized fireman sam he he's in charge of a tiny tiny village called ponty pandy
00:41:13,00:41:18,But he's got a fire truck a rescue tender a four-wheel drive suv within built animal rescuing crane
00:41:18,00:41:23,A quad bike an amphibious vehicle a hovercraft two helicopters and a mobile command center
00:41:23,00:41:30,This guy is playing the game like he's clearly set fires that get like a huge budget
00:41:30,00:41:37,"Um, can I just say one thing about george banard short very quickly? Yeah, he he had you I'm saying it wrong am I? No"
00:41:38,00:41:40,Like bernard is also in there. It's gay org. Yeah. Yeah
00:41:40,00:41:50,"I've never heard it, but like george bernard. Yeah, oh george bernard. Sure. Yeah. Yeah. Okay, george. I'm cool. Whatever. Hey, it's all cool here"
00:41:50,00:41:54,"It's late night at the soho. Yeah, picking each other up on pronouncing. I'm gonna go home going god"
00:41:54,00:42:01,There was this mad fucking fight about how to pronounce bernard. Oh man. You got to see fish live. Sorry. I'm sorry
00:42:01,00:42:06,"Um, no, so, um, he used to have a riding shed which was amazing"
00:42:06,00:42:11,He used to he lived in heritford sure and he had a riding shed which was basically on a lazy susan
00:42:11,00:42:14,He liked to chase the sun
00:42:14,00:42:19,So he would get in the sun would be beaming right in which was a big thing for him because he had specific glass
00:42:19,00:42:24,Which is in the shed windows that kind of beamed concentrated light in a way that it was meant to be healthy
00:42:24,00:42:26,"It was thought to be a healthy. It was always on fire, wasn't it?"
00:42:26,00:42:31,Bernhardt
00:42:33,00:42:37,Tell you a bit about milk floats. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah for one thing milk doesn't float
00:42:37,00:42:44,"Oh, that's yeah"
00:42:44,00:42:50,"If it's food for thorns, isn't it? Yeah left on water. It will sink. So, um"
00:42:50,00:42:52,"Oh, but no, but if you mix it"
00:42:52,00:42:57,"It's oh if you mix it if you mix it. Yeah, that's yeah, that's not that wasn't the terms"
00:42:57,00:43:02,I was anyway at the point milk floats to all UK has an FAQ page and it's one of the like it's a very it's a
00:43:03,00:43:09,Gorgeous website milk floats dot org dot uk. I cannot recommend it enough and the FAQ page begins
00:43:09,00:43:13,"All right, maybe they are not exactly frequently asked, but"
00:43:13,00:43:20,They might be the kind of questions people might ask given the opportunity
00:43:20,00:43:25,It's so nice. It's so good
00:43:25,00:43:30,"Yeah, uh, you want to do a quick game of is it bigger in europe or america? Oh, yes, I do"
00:43:31,00:43:33,"Okay, what year?"
00:43:33,00:43:40,"2023. Oh, wow. Okay. So where would you find the world's biggest dump truck?"
00:43:40,00:43:43,dump truck
00:43:43,00:43:44,USA america
00:43:44,00:43:50,That's that's a mark of pride. I'm afraid not it's in belleras in europe really
00:43:50,00:43:58,"Yeah, the bell has 757 at 10 which can move the equivalent of 1000 whale testicles in one go"
00:43:59,00:44:02,That's that's my comparison. That's not the advertising
00:44:02,00:44:05,That's how you measure trucks
00:44:05,00:44:08,I think we all know that
00:44:08,00:44:10,The world's largest log jam
00:44:10,00:44:16,So that's when you have a load of logs in a river and they get stuck and so where is it? Europe or america?
00:44:16,00:44:21,"Oh america. Well, I was tricked last time. So I'll I'll say Europe this time. Well, you've been tricked again, andy"
00:44:21,00:44:23,It's in none of us in canada
00:44:24,00:44:31,And the interesting thing about that is that it's about 20 square miles of log jam and it goes deep as well
00:44:31,00:44:37,And the logs store enough carbon to run 2.5 million cars for a year. Wow
00:44:37,00:44:40,That's interesting. Sorry. Is that a
00:44:40,00:44:43,Is a genuine question. Is that logs that have been cut by humans? No
00:44:43,00:44:48,It's they usually are like knocked down by wind and stuff like that and they fall into the river and they go down the river
00:44:48,00:44:52,And then there's like a little sort of point where they can't get out and then they just jam and jam and jam and jam
00:44:52,00:44:54,And it's a really good way of hiding carbon
00:44:54,00:45:01,And then finally the world's biggest barometer. Europe or america. Europe. I think I own I think I have that in my home
00:45:01,00:45:03,You've got a massive barometer andy. Yeah
00:45:03,00:45:06,Don't boast
00:45:06,00:45:10,It's a famous barometer. Is it? Oh god
00:45:10,00:45:15,It's one you see every day on tv on tv every day. Is there a barometer connected to big ben?
00:45:15,00:45:19,"It's good. If there is I don't know about it. It's a clock, but secretly also a barometer. Oh, wow"
00:45:20,00:45:24,"But it is in europe. Uh, it is in europe. It is on shepherds bush roundabout"
00:45:24,00:45:30,"Uh, it's uh, oh, yes, we all tune it. Sorry. We all tune in every morning for five minutes"
00:45:30,00:45:33,Just watch the live feed of shepherds bush roundabout
00:45:33,00:45:36,"Let me get on with our day, don't we? You know"
00:45:36,00:45:38,There's check what the pressure's like
00:45:38,00:45:45,"What it's um, no, it's it's a huge barometer. It was built as a barometer. It no longer works as a barometer"
00:45:45,00:45:47,It's currently covering up a big pipe
00:45:48,00:45:55,"By um, london water, but it that building was what inspired the score column in the tv show pointless"
00:45:55,00:45:59,Inspired by the world's biggest barometer
00:45:59,00:46:02,These are easy i'm surprised you haven't got any of these
00:46:02,00:46:08,"Yeah, yeah, to barometers. Do they do they go up or down? I can't remember now turns which way you hold them"
00:46:08,00:46:11,"Yeah, okay, but they can go upright and what the weather's doing. Yeah. Yeah, it's just weird because when you said big ben"
00:46:11,00:46:14,I suddenly had this image of the the um
00:46:14,00:46:20,"The mercury going up in a barometer, right and it suddenly because I was at a fair the other week and my son did that strongman thing"
00:46:20,00:46:21,Where you hit it has to hit the bell
00:46:21,00:46:28,Do you think there's anyone strong enough in the world that if that thing had to hit the bell of big ben that they could hit it hard enough?
00:46:28,00:46:30,"No, so let's move on"
00:46:30,00:46:42,"One thing I do know about it is that um, there's a lot of rhesus stuff in there, right? Oh rhesus pieces"
00:46:43,00:46:47,"Rhesus pieces which is like an american candy, but it was huge for them"
00:46:47,00:46:53,So the sales went up like 65 percent the next week just after it been in this movie
00:46:53,00:46:59,And the interesting thing about that is that they weren't the first choice if you look at the original scripts
00:46:59,00:47:03,All of the bits where it says rhesus pieces it was originally going to be m&m's
00:47:03,00:47:09,But apparently marz turned it down because they didn't want to be associated with aliens
00:47:09,00:47:12,They're called marz
00:47:12,00:47:14,I
00:47:14,00:47:17,I've got some stuff on dropping things from parachutes
00:47:17,00:47:27,"Okay, this is about a place called franz star ranch and brothel in navada and i'm in"
00:47:27,00:47:32,They had an idea of a an advertising campaign
00:47:32,00:47:36,Where they will put a mattress in the middle of an airfield
00:47:37,00:47:41,And if anyone could parachute to land on the mattress
00:47:41,00:47:46,Then they would have a chance to spend the evening with any of the women in the brothel
00:47:46,00:47:48,It didn't go very well
00:47:48,00:47:52,The problem was that all the women would stand near to the
00:47:52,00:47:57,Near to the place where people had to land right and the guy flying the airplane
00:47:57,00:48:01,Not that high could see everything that was happening and got completely distracted
00:48:01,00:48:03,There was also some sidewinds and
00:48:03,00:48:06,Long story short he crashed the plane
00:48:07,00:48:08,No
00:48:08,00:48:11,Everyone was fine. Oh no one died and the great
00:48:11,00:48:17,Great moral of the story in the end is the crash plane was so good for business
00:48:17,00:48:23,That they decided to leave it there and it's still there in navada if you ever see that crash plane next to the brothel
00:48:23,00:48:25,Is the what are you looking at me?
00:48:25,00:48:29,I've never been to navada
00:48:29,00:48:32,Well now I think you have
00:48:33,00:48:39,"Wow, isn't that an amazing idea for advertising? Yeah. Yeah, it's an amazing idea. Sorry"
00:48:39,00:48:45,"How low was the plane when he got distracted? It was quite low, but high enough the parachutes would work"
00:48:45,00:48:47,"Yeah, so that's quite high for a pilot to be like"
00:48:47,00:48:54,It's just like a little stick woman on the ground. Exactly check out the I think arms
00:48:54,00:48:58,On her maybe arms
00:48:58,00:49:01,"No, it's a tree. That's a tree. Okay. Yeah, that's okay"
00:49:02,00:49:05,Do you know that john major and tina turner were born on the same day?
00:49:05,00:49:07,Why?
00:49:07,00:49:13,"Yeah, really that's cool. Yeah, if my memory is I didn't actually write that. Wow, that's not memory. That's not memory. Yeah"
00:49:13,00:49:16,"Wow, I once you hear that you're gonna forget that now hurry"
00:49:16,00:49:20,You know everyone who was born on the same day as john major
00:49:20,00:49:23,classic Andy
00:49:23,00:49:28,"In february 2020. Yeah, there was a poll by the center of public opinion"
00:49:28,00:49:32,This is in the united states. It was ahead of the primary in new hampshire
00:49:32,00:49:41,And they asked a load of voters what they would rather and they found that 64 percent of democrats would rather see a giant meteor strike the earth
00:49:41,00:49:46,extinguishing all human life than see president trump reelected
00:49:46,00:49:52,"You know, um, there's been a sequel to phantom of the opera andrew Lloyd Webber's phantom the opera. Okay. Um"
00:49:53,00:49:57,"Yeah, it was it was written by ben elton and it was music by"
00:49:57,00:50:03,"Andrew Lloyd Webber, but it was delayed for months in the writing process because of cats"
00:50:03,00:50:06,The musical
00:50:06,00:50:12,His real-life cat he had a kitten who stood on his digital piano and wiped out all the music that he had done
00:50:12,00:50:17,"In the writing of it, which just feels god bless that kitten"
00:50:22,00:50:26,There was a group of secret operatives from britain called the choir boys
00:50:26,00:50:34,And they came up with a plan during world war two to drive hitler mad by eardropping huge amounts of pornography into his compound
00:50:34,00:50:36,"Oh, wow"
00:50:36,00:50:39,"In the end they kind of slightly, you know, they came up with the idea"
00:50:39,00:50:42,"They started going for and they thought, you know, this is just stupid"
00:50:42,00:50:44,And so they called off the whole whole idea
00:50:44,00:50:50,But not before and i quote the group had amassed an enormous collection of suitable material
00:50:51,00:50:55,"Oh, I made an invention once talking of cars and weeing. Um"
00:50:55,00:51:04,"Wow, that is a hell of a vending diagram there. I don't think it's it's the it I've forgotten the name. It's a really good name"
00:51:04,00:51:08,But basically you can piss and drive
00:51:08,00:51:13,"Okay, it was all in the name, which I can't remember my great invention"
00:51:13,00:51:16,"Oh, yeah, what's wrong with the piss and drive?"
00:51:17,00:51:23,"It's not as romantic. No, let's see. Let's see. So it's the idea that you just you don't have to stop off"
00:51:23,00:51:27,"Yeah, if you can't um like I can't start my car a lot of the time"
00:51:27,00:51:33,"So it's annoying having to stop. It's brand new as well. It's an electrical fault. I think anyway, um"
00:51:33,00:51:39,So I don't want to stop in case I can't start it again. So many people would get the electrical fault mended
00:51:39,00:51:43,But I I prefer what you've done engineering system where you never
00:51:45,00:51:53,"Does the urine get utilized? I'm thinking screen wash. Oh, yeah, that would work. Well, what it's just what it's mostly water"
00:51:53,00:51:57,I'm wondering if it's you pissing all over your electric. So there's stopping the car from functioning
00:51:57,00:52:00,to begin with
00:52:00,00:52:03,In norway if you are a fish
00:52:03,00:52:07,Um factory and you're kind of getting the whole the fillets out
00:52:07,00:52:12,What you'll do is you get the rest of the fish and you'll throw it away into a little area with all the heads and stuff like that
00:52:12,00:52:18,In that area children are allowed to go in and they cut out the little tongs of the cods
00:52:18,00:52:21,And they sell them for extra pocket money
00:52:21,00:52:24,And this is a really common thing in a place called lofferton
00:52:24,00:52:30,Um and from about six years until 17 you'll get loads of kids who'll just go in
00:52:30,00:52:34,Grab the fish and they'll cut out this little tongue in the back and apparently it's the tastiest part
00:52:34,00:52:38,And do you think they turn out to be psychopath like serial killers and psychopaths?
00:52:39,00:52:42,"Yeah, unfortunately in that area there is a lot of debt. No, there isn't"
00:52:42,00:52:47,"Um, do you want to know some other things that people are scared of singers?"
00:52:47,00:52:52,"Yeah, sure. Yeah, I wrote some dance. I thought I'd do some work after you told me I was getting paid"
00:52:52,00:52:57,"Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I forgot to tell you that until yeah quite late in the day"
00:52:57,00:53:01,"Um, but thank you for bringing your one sheet of uh"
00:53:07,00:53:13,"It wasn't very much i'm getting paid so it is just fitting. Um, wait till you hear them"
00:53:13,00:53:19,Adele is scared of seagulls. Who would have thought?
00:53:19,00:53:25,"Oh, no, yeah, yeah, um, there's more"
00:53:25,00:53:30,Rihanna's scared of fish
00:53:30,00:53:33,"Okay, and Kylie Minogue is scared of coat hangers"
00:53:34,00:53:38,"She's scared of coat hangers. Yeah, Kylie Minogue and i'm scared of commitment"
00:53:38,00:53:46,So we're all different aren't we how many different types of wrestling do you think there are in iceland one type of wrestling?
00:53:46,00:53:51,"Unlucky, there are two types of wrestling, but they do have the same name so I can see why you got that"
00:53:51,00:53:57,"That's what I was thinking. Um, it's called glimmer and basically there's two types and they're quite similar"
00:53:57,00:54:00,But one of them is a type of wrestling that you would do as a viking
00:54:01,00:54:06,If you came home after a long day doing whatever vikings do and you wanted to warm yourself up
00:54:06,00:54:08,They would just do some wrestling
00:54:08,00:54:11,Nice who with with another viking
00:54:11,00:54:18,"It's wholesome right? Yeah, there was another one which was the dueling version"
00:54:18,00:54:25,"And it was quite similar, but it would take place in a field with a large flat stone known as the slaying slab"
00:54:26,00:54:30,And that one you would try and slam your opponent onto the slab and break their back
00:54:30,00:54:36,"Wow, and the amazing thing about this is they were going to have it in the 1912 stock home olympics"
00:54:36,00:54:44,I think probably the first version not the second one and then the war happened and so the olympics got postponed
00:54:44,00:54:49,"And in 1920 they were going to do it anyway, you know, they've decided okay"
00:54:49,00:54:50,We'll keep all the same sports
00:54:50,00:54:54,But iceland decided that it only had a certain number of wrestlers
00:54:54,00:54:59,And it needed them to impress the king of demarc who was visiting at the same time as the olympic games
00:54:59,00:55:02,And so they decided we're not going to do this wrestling after all
00:55:02,00:55:03,We just want to
00:55:03,00:55:04,Impress the king of demarc
00:55:04,00:55:07,So it never became a worldwide sport that it might have done otherwise
00:55:07,00:55:10,And then in the end the king never came
00:55:10,00:55:14,There was a
00:55:14,00:55:17,Shanti not shanti but seesong when you were getting your grog
00:55:17,00:55:20,So you would get your the amount of alcohol you were allowed each day
00:55:21,00:55:26,They would give it you and they would sing while they were doing it and it was a song called Nancy Dawson
00:55:26,00:55:29,And it's the tune that we now know as here we go around the mulberry bush
00:55:29,00:55:37,But it was all about Nancy Dawson who was a stage sort of performer an actress possibly a prostitute
00:55:37,00:55:41,And the i'm not going to say what the words are to the navy song about her but they are
00:55:41,00:55:45,Are they rude they are very rude. I think they say sex worker now dear
00:55:50,00:55:54,"Um, they're meant to be quite easy, weren't they because you couldn't like not a sex worker"
00:55:54,00:55:57,"No, no"
00:55:57,00:56:02,I meant the songs to sing
00:56:02,00:56:09,"Um, because like some people can't sing names of registered competitive roller derby players include"
00:56:09,00:56:11,skate bush
00:56:11,00:56:13,venus thigh trap
00:56:13,00:56:16,And weird al spankabitch
00:56:18,00:56:23,I sort of thought what's like the rudest name that you can get to so I looked up the c-u-n-t word
00:56:23,00:56:27,"And I was heading down that way, but on the way I discovered the c-l-i-t word"
00:56:27,00:56:30,"And again, do you know how to say that?"
00:56:30,00:56:35,"Go on go on Dan give us one clite, um"
00:56:35,00:56:44,"Okay, well in the c-l-i-t, uh, you've got uh catastrophe. Oh, yeah, please welcome to the ring clitosaurus rex"
00:56:46,00:56:48,Clitler is about to enter the ring
00:56:48,00:56:52,And who's this coming up there a clitty clitty bang bang
00:56:52,00:56:57,That's really good
00:56:58,00:57:00,Oh
00:57:00,00:57:02,You
00:57:02,00:57:04,You
00:57:04,00:57:06,You
00:57:06,00:57:08,(upbeat music)
