 (playing guitar)

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:21.240
 Hello and welcome to another episode of "No Such Thing as a Fish" a weekly podcast

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.520
 this week coming to you live from Newcastle!

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:36.600
 My name is Dan Schreiber and I am sitting here with Anichezinski, Andrew Huntsomari and

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.200
 James Harkin and once again we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:47.320
 facts from the last seven days and in no particular order here we go starting with fact number

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:49.880
 one and that's my fact this week.

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:56.120
 My fact is some of the plants at the Poison Gardens at Anich Castle are so deadly they are

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:58.120
 kept in cages.

00:00:58.120 --> 00:00:59.120
 Yeah.

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:03.720
 They don't, surely they don't think they're going to escape do they?

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:07.840
 This is, this is, this is, anyone, we're up near the area of Anich Castle, does anyone

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:08.840
 know it?

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:09.840
 Yeah.

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.800
 Yeah, so this is, they have this Poison Garden and everything in it basically is aiming

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:19.720
 to kill you as a species of plant so you're not allowed to touch anything, you're not

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:23.240
 allowed to taste anything, it'd be weird if you did that anyway.

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:30.160
 I'm not sure because some of the things there are opium poppies, cannabis and magic mushrooms.

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:35.800
 So now I think I know why the cages are there especially after that cheer.

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:40.320
 If I was a gardener there, what I would do I would make some fake cages but I'd leave

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.320
 them you know busted open with the door hanging off its hinges.

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:45.320
 I'd just leave.

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:50.080
 Yes, exactly in the scanner out of the place and then just with your group you're bringing

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:51.080
 in just dash out.

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:52.080
 You've done say anything.

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:54.320
 Run around looking worried.

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:59.360
 No, this is, so they do have a number of cages, a couple of them it is because they are

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:04.800
 drugs like cannabis and opium but they also have things like giant hogweed and I listened

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:08.960
 to an interview by their head gardener who's called Trevor Jones and he was saying that

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:11.960
 that's one of the things that they need to keep in there because they have a lot of children

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:17.040
 coming to the gardens and giant hogweed a very tall, about eight foot tall and kids love

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:22.080
 to run around underneath it but it does things like bliss, if you touch it, it blisters your

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:26.920
 skin and it can go to almost third degree burns and gardeners that they know who work there

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:29.840
 who've had contact with it have all been hospitalized within hours.

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:30.840
 Wow.

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.440
 This is a very dangerous, deadly drug.

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:36.680
 Yeah, so I think also it is a bit of show that they want to sort of, yeah.

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:40.040
 Well, they do sit, don't they say though that also as well as not tasting or touching,

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:45.480
 you shouldn't sniff the plant in there and you say it's show but one summer apparently

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:50.880
 quite recently I think seven people fainted from just inhaling the toxic fumes that emanating

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:51.880
 from the plants.

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:53.480
 I don't know why anyone visits this place.

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:57.280
 Has anyone here ever fainted at the poisonous gardens?

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:58.280
 No.

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:01.200
 There's not proven yet but it will be.

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:04.680
 But what you say about it being like for show, I mean on the gates they do have like

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:10.080
 skull and crossbones and a big sign saying these plants can kill, so it is, you know.

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:14.520
 So it was set up by the local Dutchess, is it the Dutchess of North Ambulance?

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:15.520
 Yes.

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:23.360
 She kind of owns the place and she's pretty goth, like she's got, she's a big fan of taxidermy

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:28.440
 so she has 20 stuffed dogs which is a lot, even if you've got a big house that is a lot

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:30.400
 of stuffed dogs to own.

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:36.840
 So she has this whole, there's one plant there which is called Brookmansia or Angels Trumpet

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:41.760
 and the Dutchess says it is an amazing Afridiziac before it kills you.

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:42.760
 Wow.

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:43.760
 Wow.

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:45.760
 You die happy.

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:51.080
 Well supposedly Victorian ladies would add tiny amounts of the pollen to their tea because

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:55.960
 it gives you a bit of a buzz, a bit of a little drip and also I found this claimed, I don't

00:03:55.960 --> 00:04:00.280
 think this is true, that prostitutes in Paris used to put the pollen in their clients

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:05.880
 drinks because it makes you sleepy but it also has the reputation of making you dream about

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:11.480
 wild sexual adventures and you'd wake up and you'd think you'd done all this crazy stuff

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:16.280
 and actually you hadn't slept with anybody at all, you just had a cup of tea and then a nap.

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:21.000
 Actually, Angels Trumpet is a particularly frightening one, people still take it, it was quite

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.000
 popular in the early 2000s at festivals when people got into herbal highs, it's really

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.800
 about it, it's take it, it's very dangerous.

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:31.200
 The man in Germany a few years ago took some and then used the pair of garden shears to cut

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:32.880
 off his own tongue and penis.

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:33.880
 Whoa.

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:43.840
 So, in that order, I just think, you won't be able to scream if you cut your tongue up.

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:44.840
 It is very weird.

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:46.320
 It's just sensible, isn't it?

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:49.680
 Whichever order you've done, it's weird that he did one and thought, "Oh, that was a good

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:50.680
 idea.

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:51.680
 Let us try something."

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:52.680
 Oh my gosh.

00:04:52.680 --> 00:05:01.760
 I've never found a fact before that I'm just going to choose not to believe it's true.

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:06.520
 They say if you take Angels Trumpet, it makes you feel hot as a hair, blind as a bat, dry

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:09.760
 as a bone, red as a beat and mad as a hatter.

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:10.760
 hungover then.

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:11.760
 Wow.

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:19.440
 Do you know the word which is for a sort of blanket word for any antidote to a poison which

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:24.920
 is mythorodartis, it's been an old word, but it comes from mythorodartis, who's mythorodartis

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:29.040
 is a sick, he was an Anatolian king in the second century BC and I really like him, he had this

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:32.840
 terrible phobia of being poisoned, which is fair enough, his dad was killed by poisoning

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:37.440
 and it was the olden days, people were always trying to poison each other and so he decided

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:41.560
 to combat this really clever, you know, over two thousand years ago, he would ingest

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:47.000
 lots of poisons every day, his whole life to try and build up an immunity and this kind

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.480
 of work and it was actually kind of cool, he also was the first person to use a chemical

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:57.400
 weapon that he used, mad honey, so this is honey that makes you get really, really sick, it's

00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:02.640
 honey that's made by bees of eaten poisonous roedadendron, so he's known for that, but so he

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:06.320
 was very successful in war and he was always eating this poison and he built up this immunity

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:10.320
 and then at the end of his life he was about to lose in battle and the thing to do then

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:14.640
 was to commit suicide and he tried multiple times and couldn't do it because he was immune

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:19.920
 to all the poisons, but he hadn't like stabbed himself in the heart, lots of times growing

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:23.120
 up, honey, he could have done something that wasn't a poison, well eventually he did have

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:28.080
 to get his mates to stab him, but it wasn't how he wanted to go, well there are some other

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:34.320
 people who did that, so the Vysher Kanya are known as poison damsels and they're in ancient

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:40.080
 Indian tradition, so they probably didn't exist, but it's the story and they were raised

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:46.520
 on poisons from birth and what it meant was that they possessed leafily poisonous bodily fluids,

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:49.960
 so they got loads and loads of poisons as they grow up and then all of their bodily fluids

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:54.600
 to anyone else was really poisonous according to legend and so anyone who had sex with them

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:55.600
 would die.

00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:56.600
 Right.

00:06:56.600 --> 00:07:02.800
 Wow, that's amazing, again it's not true, well they're doing it deliberately, yes, so again

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:08.840
 it's this myth redidism where they deliberately did that and they were used as assassins, but

00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:12.640
 you could just go in someone's drink if you're one of these magic poisonous people, that's

00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:16.840
 not as cool the way it's looking someone off, I just have one thing that I want to add and

00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:20.960
 this is generally to people listening to the podcast, you should check out this poison

00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:25.440
 garden, it is absolutely amazing, the amount of stuff they have there, every plant genuinely

00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:30.080
 could probably kill you if you got too close, there's certain plants that have berries

00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:35.360
 on them that if kids ate three of them would kill them in a matter of hours, two's okay,

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:41.940
 two's fine, they'll get all trippy and he'll be awesome and you should check out Trevor

00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:46.360
 Jones who is the gardener there, he is such a fantastic personality and he's always there

00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:50.640
 so people should meet him, but my favorite person is the Duchess of Northumberland and she

00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:57.840
 was asked because she has such incredible knowledge about poisons, she said that her husband sometimes

00:07:57.840 --> 00:08:02.520
 is worried about her knowledge of poisons and she said but I tell him he shouldn't be concerned

00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:07.840
 because these days every single plant poison is detectable in the blood, so like I wouldn't

00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:14.280
 get away with it and then she said so I can't possibly put in print how I would kill someone

00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:18.240
 because she does know based on the poisons but my husband tells me that he'd hit me over

00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:24.000
 the head with a salmon from the freezer and then eat the salmon, so she, okay it is time

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:28.680
 for fact number two and that is Andy, my fact is that the man who got nominated for an

00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:41.520
 Oscar for editing no country for old men doesn't exist, it's not even Panto season, yes it's

00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:53.520
 not, it's always a good show and the biggest laugh is for the audience, so how is this possible?

00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:59.360
 Well he's called Roderick James, he's an elderly English gentleman and he's edited all the

00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:05.560
 movies of the Coen Brothers and he doesn't exist, he's been nominated for an Oscar twice

00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:11.080
 for editing Fargo and no country for old men, but the reason he has never been to attend

00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:16.160
 the Oscar ceremony is because he is made up by the Coen Brothers, yeah you keep saying this

00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:23.400
 but why? Well they edit all their own films and they write and direct and produce and all

00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:28.600
 of it, so they have just made up this fictional man, well just for fun they think it looks

00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:32.600
 braggie to have their name on two many of the groups, I read that it was to get around

00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:38.200
 some union issues, I don't know if that's true, but whatever the reason they are really into

00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:42.200
 it, so they were asked is he coming to the Oscars this year, he's been nominated and they

00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:46.360
 said oh no he's very old, very old at late 80s, early 90s, I don't know how he'd make the

00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:51.720
 trip and then he didn't win in the end, he got nominated but did not win and Ethan Coen

00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:56.440
 was asked how James had taken the news and he said well we know he's elderly and unhappy

00:09:56.440 --> 00:10:04.920
 so probably not well, didn't take it well, very sad, very cool, they've made a biographical

00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:09.600
 note for him, so there's this whole paragraph where they say Roderick James began his career

00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:14.760
 minding the T-Cart at Shepardon Studios in the 1930s, he remains widely admired in the film

00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:18.720
 industry for his impeccable grooming and is the world's foremost collector of Margaret

00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:29.080
 Thach and Nudes, many of them drawn from life, I feel like the Coen Brothers last film is going

00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:36.240
 to be a biopic of this guy, I was just looking at sort of people who have been nominated for

00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:41.600
 Oscars but weren't there or things like that and Banksy was up for one recently, a documentary

00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:46.200
 one for Exit Through the Gift Shop, that film he did a few years ago and he actually asked

00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:51.200
 if he could attend the Oscars and he could attend the Oscars in disguise and they said no

00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:57.080
 so the executive director of the academy said sadly we had to turn him down because the

00:10:57.080 --> 00:11:02.240
 fun but disquieting scenario is that if the film wins and five guys in monkey masks come

00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:08.400
 to the stage all saying I'm Banksy, who the hell do we give it to, it's a fair point.

00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:12.000
 So he was fine with it but Banksy said I don't agree with the concept of award ceremonies

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:17.600
 at all but I am so happy to make an exception if I'm nominated for an award.

00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:25.680
 My favourite nominee for adapted screenplay was a person called pH Vazic and pH Vazic

00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:31.400
 was nominated for Grace Stoke, the Legend of Tarzan, Lord of the Apes but this person

00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:37.680
 was in fact not a person, it was a Hungarian sheep dog belonging to who it was, who was

00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:43.480
 meant to be nominated, Robert Towne who was the writer but he hated all the changes that

00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:49.120
 happened to the script so he put his Hungarian sheep dog as the actual script writer and that

00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:53.640
 script writer got nominated so a Hungarian sheep dog has been nominated for a number.

00:11:53.640 --> 00:11:54.640
 Did it turn up?

00:11:54.640 --> 00:12:01.600
 No and it didn't win, so probably... But also he had a sheep dog called pH Vazic, that's

00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:05.160
 the unusual name for a dog isn't it, giving it to initials.

00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:10.240
 Well he's, hey if he can write screenplays he's probably going to have a very strong literature

00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:14.920
 based name as well. I think you've misunderstood your own story.

00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:19.280
 Have you heard of the actor Agi? No, no. So there was a big campaign a few years ago to

00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:26.040
 get Agi nominated for a BAFTA for his performance in the artist and if you remember the film

00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:32.640
 the artist it was that silent movie and Agi was the terrier who the dog was a big hit in

00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:38.680
 the film and lots of, you know if you're a member of BAFTA you have to pick who you nominate

00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:41.960
 and a lot of the members of BAFTA wrote to the committee to check am I allowed to nominate

00:12:41.960 --> 00:12:46.280
 this dog for a BAFTA and BAFTA had to make a public statement about it and they had

00:12:46.280 --> 00:12:51.920
 to say regretfully we must not, we must advise that as he is not a human being and as his

00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:59.800
 unique motivation as an actor was sausages, Agi is not qualified to compete for the BAFTA

00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:04.920
 in this category. It doesn't matter what their motivation is, most

00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:10.520
 actors are motivated by money which they may well be using to buy solely sausages so we don't

00:13:10.520 --> 00:13:17.280
 know. Someone who's got nominated a bunch of times but has never accepted an Oscar is a guy

00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:22.960
 called George Scott, he was an ex brilliant actor in the 60s and the 70s and...

00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:26.880
 But he's an ex brilliant, he used to be brilliant. Yeah, so he's still going, but he's all

00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:32.560
 for that. Yeah, more, really embarrassing. So George, he's got, always said he'd never

00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:36.440
 accept an Oscar, he was very clear about this, he called the Oscars a two hour meet parade,

00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:42.920
 a public display with... He's motivated by sausages, obviously. He basically was like the

00:13:42.920 --> 00:13:47.560
 suspense is contrived for economic gain, I don't want to be pitted against my fellow

00:13:47.560 --> 00:13:52.440
 actors. He kept on getting nominated in 1960 and 1962, he got a best supporting actor nomination,

00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:55.920
 he turned it down, he was like I don't want to be nominated, they wouldn't give up. In

00:13:55.920 --> 00:14:01.120
 1971 he got a best actor nomination, I think that was for the film Patton and he refused

00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:07.560
 the nomination, but they ignored his refusal and he won the Oscar. I really don't want this,

00:14:07.560 --> 00:14:11.760
 please, take it away. But yeah, they gave it to him anyway. I think Goldie Horn was giving

00:14:11.760 --> 00:14:18.280
 out the Oscar and she opened the envelope and she just went oh my god. I've pretty much

00:14:18.280 --> 00:14:30.720
 only researched dogs and Oscars. Why dogs? I like dogs. So there is a thing about the first

00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:37.320
 ever Oscars because off the back of Uggie in the artist there was a very famous dog called

00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:47.320
 Rinton Tinn. This is way back, this is 1920s era Hollywood and Rinton Tinn was I think German

00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:53.800
 shepherd maybe, like a proto lassie basically and was hugely popular and when the first ever

00:14:53.800 --> 00:15:01.640
 Academy Awards happened, Rinton Tinn received the most votes for best actor. That's true, Susan

00:15:01.640 --> 00:15:06.720
 Oilyen is a writer from America who's done a lot of research into this and it's her belief

00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:12.720
 that this happened but he won the first round and they thought we have just set up the biggest

00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:17.080
 film awards in the world, we cannot give it to a dog the first time round. We would be

00:15:17.080 --> 00:15:21.840
 a laughing stock. So they then said well we're going to have a second round and the criterion

00:15:21.840 --> 00:15:31.360
 for entry in second round is number of legs. Pretty much, you have to be a person. They weren't

00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:36.000
 taking it seriously, the voters and I haven't seen Rinton Tinn's performance but they can't

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:40.000
 have been taking it very seriously if they really thought. He was a super popular dog. I

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:43.800
 mean he was more famous than a lot of the actors he paid on screen with. Do you say this

00:15:43.800 --> 00:15:47.760
 is the first Oscars? Because the first Oscars was quite odd anyway, wasn't it? It was

00:15:47.760 --> 00:15:53.600
 the 1929 one and there was this big long dinner with lots of speeches about films and other

00:15:53.600 --> 00:15:59.480
 stuff and then the award ceremony lasted five minutes within which 15 awards were handed

00:15:59.480 --> 00:16:10.160
 out. One award every 20 seconds, sprinting up on the stage and sprinting away again. That's

00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:15.120
 amazing. There was for best actress there were five people nominated except three of them

00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:22.120
 were the same person. Janet Gainer, she's nominated for three separate films she's been in

00:16:22.120 --> 00:16:27.760
 and she did win it, yes. Do you know the most, I think this is the most embarrassing moment

00:16:27.760 --> 00:16:33.040
 in Oscar's history? Not the La La Land, thank God. Not the La La Land moon, I think. I think

00:16:33.040 --> 00:16:39.200
 although that was very embarrassing obviously. So this was in 1933. This was the best director

00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:46.280
 award and Frank Capra who was a really famous director, a lot of classic golden age Hollywood

00:16:46.280 --> 00:16:51.920
 films he directed. He was up for it and so was another director called Frank Lloyd and Frank

00:16:51.920 --> 00:16:59.200
 Capra heard the presenters say come on up and get it Frank but he hadn't been listening

00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:04.680
 properly and he had said it to Frank Lloyd and Frank Capra was already moving up the

00:17:04.680 --> 00:17:11.240
 room to collect it. I think he got to the stage and he then realised his mistake and he had

00:17:11.240 --> 00:17:17.040
 to walk all the way back in front of everybody. He later said the walk was the longest saddest

00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:24.400
 most shattering walk of my life. I wish I could have crawled under the rug like a miserable

00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:35.680
 worm. Okay we need to move on to fact number three and that is Chazinsky. My fight is that

00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:41.320
 houses in ancient Turkey had no doors or windows. You got in by climbing a ladder up to the

00:17:41.320 --> 00:17:48.560
 roof and dropping through a trap door. I just think this is so cool. So this is discovered

00:17:48.560 --> 00:17:53.400
 and this amazing settlement that archaeologists have uncovered in the last few years. It's

00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:58.840
 a settlement called Chathala Huyuk and it was settled over 9000 years ago. It's on the

00:17:58.840 --> 00:18:05.080
 Konya plain in Turkey and it's amazing and they all built their houses back to back sort

00:18:05.080 --> 00:18:08.840
 of clustered like you know terrorist houses which is very weird because they had lots

00:18:08.840 --> 00:18:13.720
 of room and no doors or windows and like little ladders that you could drop down to climb

00:18:13.720 --> 00:18:17.600
 up to get in and then you put the ladder down and you drop onto the hearth in the middle.

00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:22.760
 It's a bit weird because the entrance which you dropped through was the same as the exit

00:18:22.760 --> 00:18:27.600
 for the fire. So you wanted to make sure they didn't have a fire lit when you were coming

00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:32.120
 back home. I read a description of it. It's a bit like a honeycomb. So you have all these

00:18:32.120 --> 00:18:36.080
 like little cells that are next to each other so there's no path in between them. They're

00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:40.440
 all you've got like six neighbors one on each wall and the other way to get out is to go

00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:43.600
 through the roof. And the streets were sort of the roots, weren't they? If you were going

00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:46.880
 to someone's house you would just walk along the top and you would go down. So it was

00:18:46.880 --> 00:18:51.200
 a sort of as if it were an underground bunker but they just built it upwards and that

00:18:51.200 --> 00:18:55.000
 became their new street level. In fact they did everything on the roofs. So anything you

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:59.040
 would do as a group so any kind of let's say you were doing some religious stuff it would

00:18:59.040 --> 00:19:02.240
 all have to happen on the roofs because that's all the space you had.

00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:07.600
 Half of the was one little area wasn't there where they defecated. Really? They had like

00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:11.720
 a courtyard where they would put all of their feces and their rubbish and all that kind

00:19:11.720 --> 00:19:15.960
 of stuff in a big midden. That's nice. We have one of those in the centre of Newcastle

00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:22.960
 don't we somewhere? But they lasted so they lasted a thousand seven hundred years. That

00:19:22.960 --> 00:19:27.680
 is such a lot when you really think about that. Just have a real think about that quickly.

00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:35.480
 That's a long time. Yeah it wasn't the same people. No. And then they disappeared. Yeah.

00:19:35.480 --> 00:19:39.400
 Well then they probably disappeared. We don't really know why. In about five thousand

00:19:39.400 --> 00:19:44.440
 BC I think it was. The civilization just don't know what happened to it but they do have

00:19:44.440 --> 00:19:48.160
 got amazing paintings that they found on the inside of their walls and they're always painting

00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:52.440
 sort of like leopards and bores and bears and also they always do those hand paintings which

00:19:52.440 --> 00:19:56.360
 I like because you always do them at primary school and it's nice that sort of cave people

00:19:56.360 --> 00:20:01.000
 did that too. And they have paintings they have this really cool painting of people but

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:06.080
 without heads and then a huge one looks like a vulture and they think that's because they

00:20:06.080 --> 00:20:10.360
 did that thing when people died they would put them out on the roofs and no other animals

00:20:10.360 --> 00:20:15.720
 could get them but the vultures would carland be able to eat out their organs. So then they

00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:20.120
 would take the bodies which had no longer any meat on them so it's just a skeleton and

00:20:20.120 --> 00:20:25.640
 they would bury them in their houses under their beds. So you keep your grandma under your

00:20:25.640 --> 00:20:37.120
 bed. I've got to say I think we're getting it right and they didn't. In some ways here's

00:20:37.120 --> 00:20:40.960
 one thing that they did get right and one reason that people think they lasted so long is

00:20:40.960 --> 00:20:46.200
 because when we look at these cells now where they all lived they're almost exactly the same

00:20:46.200 --> 00:20:50.240
 and it's not like some of them have got more hand paints on or some of them have got more

00:20:50.240 --> 00:20:54.360
 decorations and stuff like that. And it seems that that is because they all basically

00:20:54.360 --> 00:21:00.560
 didn't have a way of accumulating goods. Everyone was exactly equal and one theory as to why

00:21:00.560 --> 00:21:05.280
 the way it died out in the end is because when they started farming people could start

00:21:05.280 --> 00:21:09.400
 hoarding food and then some people got richer than others and then eventually that's because

00:21:09.400 --> 00:21:12.920
 of the inequality that's why the civilization died.

00:21:12.920 --> 00:21:17.320
 But they were one of the first, they're almost the most important agricultural communities

00:21:17.320 --> 00:21:20.760
 early agricultural communities aren't they when people went from being nomadic to being

00:21:20.760 --> 00:21:25.280
 agricultural but weirdly their houses are nowhere near their fields which is quite confusing

00:21:25.280 --> 00:21:28.320
 because you would have thought if that's all you're doing you want your field to be next

00:21:28.320 --> 00:21:30.240
 to your house. But I think that's

00:21:30.240 --> 00:21:35.200
 because the clay to build their houses they wouldn't have been able to carry that from

00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:39.680
 wherever that was to next to the fields to build their houses. So instead they had to carry

00:21:39.680 --> 00:21:43.520
 their corn back to their houses. So their houses are built where the building materials

00:21:43.520 --> 00:21:46.280
 are. It's annoying to have to make that kind of trade off.

00:21:46.280 --> 00:21:51.640
 But it's much lighter to carry corn than it is to carry a house but you've got to carry

00:21:51.640 --> 00:21:55.640
 the house once. Exactly. Oh it's tricky isn't it?

00:21:55.640 --> 00:22:00.120
 And you put it on the back of one of those trailers. What trailer? I'm sorry, what?

00:22:00.120 --> 00:22:10.040
 Have you heard about the people who lived in the Old Dubai Gorge in Tanzania? No, no,

00:22:10.040 --> 00:22:14.840
 yeah fair enough. This is supposedly where the oldest houses in the

00:22:14.840 --> 00:22:22.880
 world are and they're 1.8 million years old. So that's 1.5 million years, 1.5 million years

00:22:22.880 --> 00:22:27.840
 older than humans are. There's circles of stone which are... they're not lovely houses

00:22:27.840 --> 00:22:31.680
 okay, because obviously they're 1.8 million years old. There are circles of stones and they're

00:22:31.680 --> 00:22:36.360
 surrounding slight depressions in the earth in the middle and that's about there about

00:22:36.360 --> 00:22:43.720
 13 feet across these circles. And some cynics have said these are not houses because they're

00:22:43.720 --> 00:22:48.880
 just circles of rocks. But you think how do the rocks get into circles? We don't know.

00:22:48.880 --> 00:22:53.000
 And there's a theory that maybe a growing tree pushed the rocks outwards into a circle

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:58.320
 then the tree died and it leaves a circle of rocks behind. That seems unlikely. That's silly,

00:22:58.320 --> 00:23:03.040
 yeah. But we don't know, but we don't know, but it's theory. They had presumably roofs.

00:23:03.040 --> 00:23:05.960
 They weren't just circles of stone at the time. We think or were there because if I just

00:23:05.960 --> 00:23:12.080
 put a strewed a few pebbles around me and then said look, I've built a house. I don't

00:23:12.080 --> 00:23:16.640
 think I'm being employed by any architectural firms. It's tricky because there's no definition

00:23:16.640 --> 00:23:23.120
 really of what a house is. Yeah. I got a fact about trapdoors because this was about getting

00:23:23.120 --> 00:23:29.960
 into a trapdoor. So Russo, the French writer, had a trapdoor in his office for whenever he

00:23:29.960 --> 00:23:36.880
 had unexpected guests. Was it to drop them through? He pressed a button. It was to him to

00:23:36.880 --> 00:23:41.960
 flee and they'd knock on the door and say, I want to see if Mr. Russo is in. Oh no, sorry.

00:23:41.960 --> 00:23:47.240
 He's pulling the rug back over him for the trapdoor. I don't know. It's basically that Mark Zuckerberg

00:23:47.240 --> 00:23:51.420
 has that as well. Really? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Generally, wow.

00:23:51.420 --> 00:24:00.440
 Russo just locked his door. It's not as cool, is it? It's not as cool as the trapdoor.

00:24:00.440 --> 00:24:06.360
 It's not as cool. They found a few years back what they think is the oldest door in Europe

00:24:06.360 --> 00:24:11.640
 and they think it's 5,000 years old and it was found when archaeologists in Zurich were

00:24:11.640 --> 00:24:16.080
 digging, I think it was for a car park and they suddenly found this door. Do you know how

00:24:16.080 --> 00:24:23.400
 they dated it? Someone had put a letter in there and they looked at the postman. Oh, yeah.

00:24:23.400 --> 00:24:30.060
 They counted the rings. It was a long shot. Yeah. What a wooden door. It had rings. Yeah,

00:24:30.060 --> 00:24:34.520
 so they were able to count. Very good. I thought you sensed. Yeah, because you'd only know

00:24:34.520 --> 00:24:39.620
 from when it was born, the tree, right? Oh, this is 12 years old. They could have carbon

00:24:39.620 --> 00:24:51.360
 dated it, I guess, right? Yes. It's obviously the yet. Wait, they must. They did. Did they count

00:24:51.360 --> 00:24:54.240
 the rings? They counted the rings, but the rings obviously

00:24:54.240 --> 00:25:02.200
 had, but the tree was chosen. I don't know who wrote this bullshit. I'll tell you what,

00:25:02.200 --> 00:25:07.160
 when we do it in the office, it's embarrassing enough. In front of a thousand people. I really

00:25:07.160 --> 00:25:12.600
 have to question what's going on at this head of mind. Should we, another door, another

00:25:12.600 --> 00:25:20.520
 door thing? Yeah. Quickly move on. Some Native American tribes and actually I think some

00:25:20.520 --> 00:25:26.560
 East African tribes used to have keyhole-shaped doors. And this, why do you think that is?

00:25:26.560 --> 00:25:35.080
 Of keys. They had really huge keys. Really big kind of dresses, and so it was the shape

00:25:35.080 --> 00:25:40.680
 of them. Oh, that's right. Oh, like a lady's loose sign, which goes out like that, like

00:25:40.680 --> 00:25:45.080
 a keyhole. They didn't have houses. They just had a load of lady's lavatories. Right.

00:25:45.080 --> 00:25:53.120
 I get it, no, you're all incorrect. They counted the rings. It's the opposite of wearing

00:25:53.120 --> 00:25:58.000
 dresses. It's either, it's like if they were wearing dresses, but upside down. It's keyhole

00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:02.460
 shape because the top is much wider, and it's because people usually wouldn't want to carry

00:26:02.460 --> 00:26:07.440
 big bundles on their heads. And then when they're entering their house, the top is wider

00:26:07.440 --> 00:26:10.760
 so that they can fit those bundles through. But you don't want to let all the heat out

00:26:10.760 --> 00:26:16.000
 of your house. And so the bottom is much narrower, so you can have heat, very cool. We need to

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:22.360
 move on to our final fact. Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show, and that is James.

00:26:22.360 --> 00:26:29.120
 Okay, my fact this week is that the red triangle slug can escape from frogs by supergluing them

00:26:29.120 --> 00:26:37.680
 to trees. Ah, so cool. It is really cool. So I read the story in New Sciences quite recently.

00:26:37.680 --> 00:26:49.140
 There was a guy called John Gould from the University of Newcastle in Australia. And he

00:26:49.140 --> 00:26:55.840
 made the discovery when he spotted a frog stuck to a tree. And there was a slug next to it,

00:26:55.840 --> 00:27:01.720
 presumably kind of rubbing his hands with glue or something. And he cut a bit off the tree.

00:27:01.720 --> 00:27:11.200
 He looked how old it was, and then he took it off. I believe it was. And then he took the frog

00:27:11.200 --> 00:27:15.600
 back to his lab, and he left it there for a while to see if it would get free, and it really

00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:21.520
 didn't. Eventually they prized it free, and they put it in a like a little container, and

00:27:21.520 --> 00:27:26.920
 then it kept getting stuck to the sides of the container. And it turns out that this slug

00:27:26.920 --> 00:27:31.360
 can get this kind of mucus, and it normally has a nice like slippery mucus that it can

00:27:31.360 --> 00:27:34.480
 travel on, but it can also make this really, really sticky mucus.

00:27:34.480 --> 00:27:40.180
 Wait, so why did they get the frog? Did they then interview the frog? Would they tell us

00:27:40.180 --> 00:27:46.800
 how this happened? I was just trying to catch a slug, and it got all over my feet.

00:27:46.800 --> 00:27:50.940
 But it is so weird, because it's so weird that the slug, because this is an amazing defense

00:27:50.940 --> 00:27:54.660
 mechanism, once it's superglue the frog to the tree, as you said, it just kind of hangs

00:27:54.660 --> 00:28:00.680
 out next to it's the thing that it slugged up. Wow, that is awesome. And it last days

00:28:00.680 --> 00:28:05.280
 doesn't it? Yeah, the glue. So they do get off, but it is a couple of days of what must

00:28:05.280 --> 00:28:11.040
 be horribly embarrassing sort of. Do the slugs invite their mates? Yeah, the other frogs

00:28:11.040 --> 00:28:14.480
 must be like, we're going to go catch that cool frog movie. Do you want to come? I'll be

00:28:14.480 --> 00:28:19.480
 there in a minute. You didn't get stuck, did you? I don't know, it feels like that would

00:28:19.480 --> 00:28:25.740
 be a thing. Yeah, probably. So this mucus is really good, because it's a very unusual

00:28:25.740 --> 00:28:32.340
 thing in that it's very glowy and very sticky, but as it gets wetter, it gets stickier. And

00:28:32.340 --> 00:28:36.140
 this is something that doesn't really happen usually when things dry out, they get, or they

00:28:36.140 --> 00:28:40.740
 adhere more. Like if you think about super glue, when it dries out, it's much more sticky.

00:28:40.740 --> 00:28:44.460
 So this works better in wet conditions, and they think we might be able to use it, humans

00:28:44.460 --> 00:28:49.580
 might be able to use it for like fixing wounds, or there are similar ones that they use

00:28:49.580 --> 00:28:54.000
 to kind of put in people's hearts. If you have a lesion in your heart, you can hold

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:57.160
 that together, because obviously a lot of blood around there and it works there. So this

00:28:57.160 --> 00:29:01.840
 might be really useful for us in future. Or blasters that don't fall off in the sea.

00:29:01.840 --> 00:29:09.720
 Yes. That's amazing. I'm down with, I'll fund that research. That is weird. That's why

00:29:09.720 --> 00:29:12.760
 when you get a slug slime on your hands, don't put water on it to wash it off because it

00:29:12.760 --> 00:29:17.560
 just makes it worse. Really? Is that right? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh, yeah, because slug slime,

00:29:17.560 --> 00:29:26.520
 it can kind of suck up water into it. So it just gets bigger. It drinks the water. Yeah,

00:29:26.520 --> 00:29:31.520
 it can do. So if you think about a slug, they like to be wet, don't they? They like to

00:29:31.520 --> 00:29:36.160
 be moist. But then they're always giving out this slug slime all the time. So you think

00:29:36.160 --> 00:29:40.440
 they would just dry out. But what actually happens is some of that slug slime can take

00:29:40.440 --> 00:29:43.560
 in the water because it just gets loads and loads of water in it, and it can actually

00:29:43.560 --> 00:29:48.960
 almost drink through this slime. It's crazy. I was reading about banana slugs. They have

00:29:48.960 --> 00:29:55.040
 a thing where sometimes when they have sex, the slime itself is so sticky that the male

00:29:55.040 --> 00:30:01.120
 slugs penis will get stuck in there. And because it's just too sticky. So their only option

00:30:01.120 --> 00:30:07.760
 is they bite it off and just leave it. This is where Anna's German guy at the festival

00:30:07.760 --> 00:30:19.320
 got as ideas from. It's too sticky. It's got to go. Oh God. Yeah. Really? But they do sometimes

00:30:19.320 --> 00:30:26.800
 bite each other's penises off anyway, I think. They're not really supposed to, but it's considered

00:30:26.800 --> 00:30:33.040
 root. Sorry about it. I wasn't meant to do that. So they're all amaphyridites on this

00:30:33.040 --> 00:30:36.640
 slug. So which is good. That means when they have sex, then both can go away pregnant,

00:30:36.640 --> 00:30:41.200
 which is nice. But they will at the end, you have to scamper really fast. Otherwise, your

00:30:41.200 --> 00:30:46.040
 partner might bite off your penis, which is a bit scary. But the best slug mating actually

00:30:46.040 --> 00:30:51.880
 is the leopard slug mating, isn't it? Because the leopard slug has sex while upside down

00:30:51.880 --> 00:30:57.480
 hanging from a branch. And the reason it does this is because it's penis is so big that

00:30:57.480 --> 00:31:09.040
 it needs to use gravity to unroll it. We've all tried that line. My Tinder profile was me

00:31:09.040 --> 00:31:16.520
 hanging upside down from a tree. I think you know what this means. This is amazing, though.

00:31:16.520 --> 00:31:20.760
 They'll climb up a tree, two slugs on the side of their mating, and then they produce

00:31:20.760 --> 00:31:26.320
 slime that can solidify really fast. So it acts like a bungee cord. So they drop down

00:31:26.320 --> 00:31:31.840
 off a branch hanging from their slime. And then they unfold these penises, which are almost

00:31:31.840 --> 00:31:36.480
 as big as they are. They're really, really long. And they intertwine their own slug bodies,

00:31:36.480 --> 00:31:40.240
 which looks quite nice like a plant. And then they intertwine their own slug penises, which

00:31:40.240 --> 00:31:44.760
 are sort of basically like extra slugs in the end if you look at it. It looks quite nice.

00:31:44.760 --> 00:31:50.960
 And then they have sex. You've got such a low bar for what counts as nice, and I like

00:31:50.960 --> 00:31:55.520
 that. It's very pretty. And then when they're done, they eat their way back up the rope.

00:31:55.520 --> 00:32:03.240
 Wow. Oh, that's a bit you're disgusted by. He got some weird standards in your castle.

00:32:03.240 --> 00:32:07.520
 Oh, what I'm thinking of is that seen in Mission Impossible, now, where he's, is he slowly

00:32:07.520 --> 00:32:12.560
 lowers himself down the rope? If he'd got his knob out at the bottom of that rope.

00:32:12.560 --> 00:32:23.960
 What are you doing, Ethan? Sorry. I'll eat the rope and come back up.

00:32:23.960 --> 00:32:30.360
 There's a thing that I like as well, just on the biting off of penis bed.

00:32:30.360 --> 00:32:38.000
 Well, it's about losing body parts, and there's a thing that some slugs can do. There's sea

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:42.840
 slugs that do this, certain sleas slugs, and there's tail dropper slugs. And what they do is,

00:32:42.840 --> 00:32:47.960
 if there's predator coming towards them, they basically just rip off a bit of their body

00:32:47.960 --> 00:32:52.560
 in the tail dropper. It's the tail. And they use it as a decoy bit of bait. So they'll

00:32:52.560 --> 00:32:57.800
 be like, go have that. And so the predator will eat that because it's not moving. And while

00:32:57.800 --> 00:33:02.360
 they're munching on the bit of that body, the rest of them can get away. It's not exactly

00:33:02.360 --> 00:33:06.000
 right there. I think we mentioned there's a scorpion that does that.

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:11.720
 Oh, yeah, there is one. It breaks off its tail. Well, the problem is it breaks off its anus.

00:33:11.720 --> 00:33:16.000
 Yes. And then it can't poo anymore. And it can't have a poo ever again. And the poo

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:19.600
 just sort of builds up in its body because it's thrown away its tail. So it doesn't get

00:33:19.600 --> 00:33:24.800
 eaten, but then three days later it dies of constipation. Yeah. Does it really? Yeah. They

00:33:24.800 --> 00:33:29.560
 don't explode. Yeah, they do die. I wonder if they regress it. I guess you've, you've

00:33:29.560 --> 00:33:33.520
 then, it's then like another mission impossible film. You've got three days left to pass on your

00:33:33.520 --> 00:33:40.000
 jeep. But it's quite hard to attract female scorpions because you're getting bigger and

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:46.920
 bigger full of poo. Yeah. Yeah. So that's an exciting pitch, I think, for a film. Ethan

00:33:46.920 --> 00:33:58.200
 Hunt has thrown away his own ass. So I've actually been looking at glue and gluing things. Do

00:33:58.200 --> 00:34:04.480
 you, because it was about, because it was about glue. So do you remember the guy who, who

00:34:04.480 --> 00:34:12.280
 glued himself to Gordon Brown's sleeve? Politics was a lot more fun in those days. There was

00:34:12.280 --> 00:34:18.200
 a guy called Dan Glass, and he was an environmental campaigner. He was from a campaign group called

00:34:18.200 --> 00:34:23.640
 Plane Stupid. And he got invited to a reception at Downing Street in 2009 and he thought, now's

00:34:23.640 --> 00:34:28.640
 my chance. And he, so he thought, I'm going to do it. I'm going to glue myself to the Prime

00:34:28.640 --> 00:34:35.800
 Minister to make a point about climate change, fair play. And he said, I was saying to Gordon

00:34:35.800 --> 00:34:41.400
 Brown, you can run away from climate change, but you can't run away from my arm. And, and

00:34:41.400 --> 00:34:46.840
 he glued up his hand and he did it. He managed to grab Gordon Brown's sleeve and superglued

00:34:46.840 --> 00:34:51.600
 himself to the Prime Minister inside Downing Street. However, the PM managed to outfox him

00:34:51.600 --> 00:34:59.920
 by the relatively simple method of taking off his jacket. Okay, that's it. That is all

00:34:59.920 --> 00:35:03.720
