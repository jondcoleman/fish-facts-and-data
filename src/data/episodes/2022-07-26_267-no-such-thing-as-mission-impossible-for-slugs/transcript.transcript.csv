00:00:08,00:00:21,"Hello and welcome to another episode of ""No Such Thing as a Fish"" a weekly podcast"
00:00:21,00:00:24,this week coming to you live from Newcastle!
00:00:24,00:00:36,"My name is Dan Schreiber and I am sitting here with Anichezinski, Andrew Huntsomari and"
00:00:36,00:00:41,James Harkin and once again we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite
00:00:41,00:00:47,facts from the last seven days and in no particular order here we go starting with fact number
00:00:47,00:00:49,one and that's my fact this week.
00:00:49,00:00:56,My fact is some of the plants at the Poison Gardens at Anich Castle are so deadly they are
00:00:56,00:00:58,kept in cages.
00:00:58,00:00:59,Yeah.
00:00:59,00:01:03,"They don't, surely they don't think they're going to escape do they?"
00:01:03,00:01:07,"This is, this is, this is, anyone, we're up near the area of Anich Castle, does anyone"
00:01:07,00:01:08,know it?
00:01:08,00:01:09,Yeah.
00:01:09,00:01:14,"Yeah, so this is, they have this Poison Garden and everything in it basically is aiming"
00:01:14,00:01:19,"to kill you as a species of plant so you're not allowed to touch anything, you're not"
00:01:19,00:01:23,"allowed to taste anything, it'd be weird if you did that anyway."
00:01:23,00:01:30,"I'm not sure because some of the things there are opium poppies, cannabis and magic mushrooms."
00:01:30,00:01:35,So now I think I know why the cages are there especially after that cheer.
00:01:35,00:01:40,"If I was a gardener there, what I would do I would make some fake cages but I'd leave"
00:01:40,00:01:44,them you know busted open with the door hanging off its hinges.
00:01:44,00:01:45,I'd just leave.
00:01:45,00:01:50,"Yes, exactly in the scanner out of the place and then just with your group you're bringing"
00:01:50,00:01:51,in just dash out.
00:01:51,00:01:52,You've done say anything.
00:01:52,00:01:54,Run around looking worried.
00:01:54,00:01:59,"No, this is, so they do have a number of cages, a couple of them it is because they are"
00:01:59,00:02:04,drugs like cannabis and opium but they also have things like giant hogweed and I listened
00:02:04,00:02:08,to an interview by their head gardener who's called Trevor Jones and he was saying that
00:02:08,00:02:11,that's one of the things that they need to keep in there because they have a lot of children
00:02:11,00:02:17,"coming to the gardens and giant hogweed a very tall, about eight foot tall and kids love"
00:02:17,00:02:22,"to run around underneath it but it does things like bliss, if you touch it, it blisters your"
00:02:22,00:02:26,skin and it can go to almost third degree burns and gardeners that they know who work there
00:02:26,00:02:29,who've had contact with it have all been hospitalized within hours.
00:02:29,00:02:30,Wow.
00:02:30,00:02:32,"This is a very dangerous, deadly drug."
00:02:32,00:02:36,"Yeah, so I think also it is a bit of show that they want to sort of, yeah."
00:02:36,00:02:40,"Well, they do sit, don't they say though that also as well as not tasting or touching,"
00:02:40,00:02:45,you shouldn't sniff the plant in there and you say it's show but one summer apparently
00:02:45,00:02:50,quite recently I think seven people fainted from just inhaling the toxic fumes that emanating
00:02:50,00:02:51,from the plants.
00:02:51,00:02:53,I don't know why anyone visits this place.
00:02:53,00:02:57,Has anyone here ever fainted at the poisonous gardens?
00:02:57,00:02:58,No.
00:02:58,00:03:01,There's not proven yet but it will be.
00:03:01,00:03:04,"But what you say about it being like for show, I mean on the gates they do have like"
00:03:04,00:03:10,"skull and crossbones and a big sign saying these plants can kill, so it is, you know."
00:03:10,00:03:14,"So it was set up by the local Dutchess, is it the Dutchess of North Ambulance?"
00:03:14,00:03:15,Yes.
00:03:15,00:03:23,"She kind of owns the place and she's pretty goth, like she's got, she's a big fan of taxidermy"
00:03:23,00:03:28,"so she has 20 stuffed dogs which is a lot, even if you've got a big house that is a lot"
00:03:28,00:03:30,of stuffed dogs to own.
00:03:30,00:03:36,"So she has this whole, there's one plant there which is called Brookmansia or Angels Trumpet"
00:03:36,00:03:41,and the Dutchess says it is an amazing Afridiziac before it kills you.
00:03:41,00:03:42,Wow.
00:03:42,00:03:43,Wow.
00:03:43,00:03:45,You die happy.
00:03:45,00:03:51,Well supposedly Victorian ladies would add tiny amounts of the pollen to their tea because
00:03:51,00:03:55,"it gives you a bit of a buzz, a bit of a little drip and also I found this claimed, I don't"
00:03:55,00:04:00,"think this is true, that prostitutes in Paris used to put the pollen in their clients"
00:04:00,00:04:05,drinks because it makes you sleepy but it also has the reputation of making you dream about
00:04:05,00:04:11,wild sexual adventures and you'd wake up and you'd think you'd done all this crazy stuff
00:04:11,00:04:16,"and actually you hadn't slept with anybody at all, you just had a cup of tea and then a nap."
00:04:16,00:04:21,"Actually, Angels Trumpet is a particularly frightening one, people still take it, it was quite"
00:04:21,00:04:25,"popular in the early 2000s at festivals when people got into herbal highs, it's really"
00:04:25,00:04:26,"about it, it's take it, it's very dangerous."
00:04:26,00:04:31,The man in Germany a few years ago took some and then used the pair of garden shears to cut
00:04:31,00:04:32,off his own tongue and penis.
00:04:32,00:04:33,Whoa.
00:04:33,00:04:43,"So, in that order, I just think, you won't be able to scream if you cut your tongue up."
00:04:43,00:04:44,It is very weird.
00:04:44,00:04:46,"It's just sensible, isn't it?"
00:04:46,00:04:49,"Whichever order you've done, it's weird that he did one and thought, ""Oh, that was a good"
00:04:49,00:04:50,idea.
00:04:50,00:04:51,"Let us try something."""
00:04:51,00:04:52,Oh my gosh.
00:04:52,00:05:01,I've never found a fact before that I'm just going to choose not to believe it's true.
00:05:01,00:05:06,"They say if you take Angels Trumpet, it makes you feel hot as a hair, blind as a bat, dry"
00:05:06,00:05:09,"as a bone, red as a beat and mad as a hatter."
00:05:09,00:05:10,hungover then.
00:05:10,00:05:11,Wow.
00:05:11,00:05:19,Do you know the word which is for a sort of blanket word for any antidote to a poison which
00:05:19,00:05:24,"is mythorodartis, it's been an old word, but it comes from mythorodartis, who's mythorodartis"
00:05:24,00:05:29,"is a sick, he was an Anatolian king in the second century BC and I really like him, he had this"
00:05:29,00:05:32,"terrible phobia of being poisoned, which is fair enough, his dad was killed by poisoning"
00:05:32,00:05:37,"and it was the olden days, people were always trying to poison each other and so he decided"
00:05:37,00:05:41,"to combat this really clever, you know, over two thousand years ago, he would ingest"
00:05:41,00:05:47,"lots of poisons every day, his whole life to try and build up an immunity and this kind"
00:05:47,00:05:51,"of work and it was actually kind of cool, he also was the first person to use a chemical"
00:05:51,00:05:57,"weapon that he used, mad honey, so this is honey that makes you get really, really sick, it's"
00:05:57,00:06:02,"honey that's made by bees of eaten poisonous roedadendron, so he's known for that, but so he"
00:06:02,00:06:06,was very successful in war and he was always eating this poison and he built up this immunity
00:06:06,00:06:10,and then at the end of his life he was about to lose in battle and the thing to do then
00:06:10,00:06:14,was to commit suicide and he tried multiple times and couldn't do it because he was immune
00:06:14,00:06:19,"to all the poisons, but he hadn't like stabbed himself in the heart, lots of times growing"
00:06:19,00:06:23,"up, honey, he could have done something that wasn't a poison, well eventually he did have"
00:06:23,00:06:28,"to get his mates to stab him, but it wasn't how he wanted to go, well there are some other"
00:06:28,00:06:34,"people who did that, so the Vysher Kanya are known as poison damsels and they're in ancient"
00:06:34,00:06:40,"Indian tradition, so they probably didn't exist, but it's the story and they were raised"
00:06:40,00:06:46,"on poisons from birth and what it meant was that they possessed leafily poisonous bodily fluids,"
00:06:46,00:06:49,so they got loads and loads of poisons as they grow up and then all of their bodily fluids
00:06:49,00:06:54,to anyone else was really poisonous according to legend and so anyone who had sex with them
00:06:54,00:06:55,would die.
00:06:55,00:06:56,Right.
00:06:56,00:07:02,"Wow, that's amazing, again it's not true, well they're doing it deliberately, yes, so again"
00:07:02,00:07:08,"it's this myth redidism where they deliberately did that and they were used as assassins, but"
00:07:08,00:07:12,"you could just go in someone's drink if you're one of these magic poisonous people, that's"
00:07:12,00:07:16,"not as cool the way it's looking someone off, I just have one thing that I want to add and"
00:07:16,00:07:20,"this is generally to people listening to the podcast, you should check out this poison"
00:07:20,00:07:25,"garden, it is absolutely amazing, the amount of stuff they have there, every plant genuinely"
00:07:25,00:07:30,"could probably kill you if you got too close, there's certain plants that have berries"
00:07:30,00:07:35,"on them that if kids ate three of them would kill them in a matter of hours, two's okay,"
00:07:35,00:07:41,"two's fine, they'll get all trippy and he'll be awesome and you should check out Trevor"
00:07:41,00:07:46,"Jones who is the gardener there, he is such a fantastic personality and he's always there"
00:07:46,00:07:50,"so people should meet him, but my favorite person is the Duchess of Northumberland and she"
00:07:50,00:07:57,"was asked because she has such incredible knowledge about poisons, she said that her husband sometimes"
00:07:57,00:08:02,is worried about her knowledge of poisons and she said but I tell him he shouldn't be concerned
00:08:02,00:08:07,"because these days every single plant poison is detectable in the blood, so like I wouldn't"
00:08:07,00:08:14,get away with it and then she said so I can't possibly put in print how I would kill someone
00:08:14,00:08:18,because she does know based on the poisons but my husband tells me that he'd hit me over
00:08:18,00:08:24,"the head with a salmon from the freezer and then eat the salmon, so she, okay it is time"
00:08:24,00:08:28,"for fact number two and that is Andy, my fact is that the man who got nominated for an"
00:08:28,00:08:41,"Oscar for editing no country for old men doesn't exist, it's not even Panto season, yes it's"
00:08:41,00:08:53,"not, it's always a good show and the biggest laugh is for the audience, so how is this possible?"
00:08:53,00:08:59,"Well he's called Roderick James, he's an elderly English gentleman and he's edited all the"
00:08:59,00:09:05,"movies of the Coen Brothers and he doesn't exist, he's been nominated for an Oscar twice"
00:09:05,00:09:11,"for editing Fargo and no country for old men, but the reason he has never been to attend"
00:09:11,00:09:16,"the Oscar ceremony is because he is made up by the Coen Brothers, yeah you keep saying this"
00:09:16,00:09:23,but why? Well they edit all their own films and they write and direct and produce and all
00:09:23,00:09:28,"of it, so they have just made up this fictional man, well just for fun they think it looks"
00:09:28,00:09:32,"braggie to have their name on two many of the groups, I read that it was to get around"
00:09:32,00:09:38,"some union issues, I don't know if that's true, but whatever the reason they are really into"
00:09:38,00:09:42,"it, so they were asked is he coming to the Oscars this year, he's been nominated and they"
00:09:42,00:09:46,"said oh no he's very old, very old at late 80s, early 90s, I don't know how he'd make the"
00:09:46,00:09:51,"trip and then he didn't win in the end, he got nominated but did not win and Ethan Coen"
00:09:51,00:09:56,was asked how James had taken the news and he said well we know he's elderly and unhappy
00:09:56,00:10:04,"so probably not well, didn't take it well, very sad, very cool, they've made a biographical"
00:10:04,00:10:09,"note for him, so there's this whole paragraph where they say Roderick James began his career"
00:10:09,00:10:14,"minding the T-Cart at Shepardon Studios in the 1930s, he remains widely admired in the film"
00:10:14,00:10:18,industry for his impeccable grooming and is the world's foremost collector of Margaret
00:10:18,00:10:29,"Thach and Nudes, many of them drawn from life, I feel like the Coen Brothers last film is going"
00:10:29,00:10:36,"to be a biopic of this guy, I was just looking at sort of people who have been nominated for"
00:10:36,00:10:41,"Oscars but weren't there or things like that and Banksy was up for one recently, a documentary"
00:10:41,00:10:46,"one for Exit Through the Gift Shop, that film he did a few years ago and he actually asked"
00:10:46,00:10:51,if he could attend the Oscars and he could attend the Oscars in disguise and they said no
00:10:51,00:10:57,so the executive director of the academy said sadly we had to turn him down because the
00:10:57,00:11:02,fun but disquieting scenario is that if the film wins and five guys in monkey masks come
00:11:02,00:11:08,"to the stage all saying I'm Banksy, who the hell do we give it to, it's a fair point."
00:11:08,00:11:12,So he was fine with it but Banksy said I don't agree with the concept of award ceremonies
00:11:12,00:11:17,at all but I am so happy to make an exception if I'm nominated for an award.
00:11:17,00:11:25,My favourite nominee for adapted screenplay was a person called pH Vazic and pH Vazic
00:11:25,00:11:31,"was nominated for Grace Stoke, the Legend of Tarzan, Lord of the Apes but this person"
00:11:31,00:11:37,"was in fact not a person, it was a Hungarian sheep dog belonging to who it was, who was"
00:11:37,00:11:43,"meant to be nominated, Robert Towne who was the writer but he hated all the changes that"
00:11:43,00:11:49,happened to the script so he put his Hungarian sheep dog as the actual script writer and that
00:11:49,00:11:53,script writer got nominated so a Hungarian sheep dog has been nominated for a number.
00:11:53,00:11:54,Did it turn up?
00:11:54,00:12:01,"No and it didn't win, so probably... But also he had a sheep dog called pH Vazic, that's"
00:12:01,00:12:05,"the unusual name for a dog isn't it, giving it to initials."
00:12:05,00:12:10,"Well he's, hey if he can write screenplays he's probably going to have a very strong literature"
00:12:10,00:12:14,based name as well. I think you've misunderstood your own story.
00:12:14,00:12:19,"Have you heard of the actor Agi? No, no. So there was a big campaign a few years ago to"
00:12:19,00:12:26,get Agi nominated for a BAFTA for his performance in the artist and if you remember the film
00:12:26,00:12:32,the artist it was that silent movie and Agi was the terrier who the dog was a big hit in
00:12:32,00:12:38,"the film and lots of, you know if you're a member of BAFTA you have to pick who you nominate"
00:12:38,00:12:41,and a lot of the members of BAFTA wrote to the committee to check am I allowed to nominate
00:12:41,00:12:46,this dog for a BAFTA and BAFTA had to make a public statement about it and they had
00:12:46,00:12:51,"to say regretfully we must not, we must advise that as he is not a human being and as his"
00:12:51,00:12:59,"unique motivation as an actor was sausages, Agi is not qualified to compete for the BAFTA"
00:12:59,00:13:04,"in this category. It doesn't matter what their motivation is, most"
00:13:04,00:13:10,actors are motivated by money which they may well be using to buy solely sausages so we don't
00:13:10,00:13:17,know. Someone who's got nominated a bunch of times but has never accepted an Oscar is a guy
00:13:17,00:13:22,"called George Scott, he was an ex brilliant actor in the 60s and the 70s and..."
00:13:22,00:13:26,"But he's an ex brilliant, he used to be brilliant. Yeah, so he's still going, but he's all"
00:13:26,00:13:32,"for that. Yeah, more, really embarrassing. So George, he's got, always said he'd never"
00:13:32,00:13:36,"accept an Oscar, he was very clear about this, he called the Oscars a two hour meet parade,"
00:13:36,00:13:42,"a public display with... He's motivated by sausages, obviously. He basically was like the"
00:13:42,00:13:47,"suspense is contrived for economic gain, I don't want to be pitted against my fellow"
00:13:47,00:13:52,"actors. He kept on getting nominated in 1960 and 1962, he got a best supporting actor nomination,"
00:13:52,00:13:55,"he turned it down, he was like I don't want to be nominated, they wouldn't give up. In"
00:13:55,00:14:01,"1971 he got a best actor nomination, I think that was for the film Patton and he refused"
00:14:01,00:14:07,"the nomination, but they ignored his refusal and he won the Oscar. I really don't want this,"
00:14:07,00:14:11,"please, take it away. But yeah, they gave it to him anyway. I think Goldie Horn was giving"
00:14:11,00:14:18,out the Oscar and she opened the envelope and she just went oh my god. I've pretty much
00:14:18,00:14:30,only researched dogs and Oscars. Why dogs? I like dogs. So there is a thing about the first
00:14:30,00:14:37,ever Oscars because off the back of Uggie in the artist there was a very famous dog called
00:14:37,00:14:47,"Rinton Tinn. This is way back, this is 1920s era Hollywood and Rinton Tinn was I think German"
00:14:47,00:14:53,"shepherd maybe, like a proto lassie basically and was hugely popular and when the first ever"
00:14:53,00:15:01,"Academy Awards happened, Rinton Tinn received the most votes for best actor. That's true, Susan"
00:15:01,00:15:06,Oilyen is a writer from America who's done a lot of research into this and it's her belief
00:15:06,00:15:12,that this happened but he won the first round and they thought we have just set up the biggest
00:15:12,00:15:17,"film awards in the world, we cannot give it to a dog the first time round. We would be"
00:15:17,00:15:21,a laughing stock. So they then said well we're going to have a second round and the criterion
00:15:21,00:15:31,"for entry in second round is number of legs. Pretty much, you have to be a person. They weren't"
00:15:31,00:15:36,"taking it seriously, the voters and I haven't seen Rinton Tinn's performance but they can't"
00:15:36,00:15:40,have been taking it very seriously if they really thought. He was a super popular dog. I
00:15:40,00:15:43,mean he was more famous than a lot of the actors he paid on screen with. Do you say this
00:15:43,00:15:47,"is the first Oscars? Because the first Oscars was quite odd anyway, wasn't it? It was"
00:15:47,00:15:53,the 1929 one and there was this big long dinner with lots of speeches about films and other
00:15:53,00:15:59,stuff and then the award ceremony lasted five minutes within which 15 awards were handed
00:15:59,00:16:10,"out. One award every 20 seconds, sprinting up on the stage and sprinting away again. That's"
00:16:10,00:16:15,amazing. There was for best actress there were five people nominated except three of them
00:16:15,00:16:22,"were the same person. Janet Gainer, she's nominated for three separate films she's been in"
00:16:22,00:16:27,"and she did win it, yes. Do you know the most, I think this is the most embarrassing moment"
00:16:27,00:16:33,"in Oscar's history? Not the La La Land, thank God. Not the La La Land moon, I think. I think"
00:16:33,00:16:39,although that was very embarrassing obviously. So this was in 1933. This was the best director
00:16:39,00:16:46,"award and Frank Capra who was a really famous director, a lot of classic golden age Hollywood"
00:16:46,00:16:51,films he directed. He was up for it and so was another director called Frank Lloyd and Frank
00:16:51,00:16:59,Capra heard the presenters say come on up and get it Frank but he hadn't been listening
00:16:59,00:17:04,properly and he had said it to Frank Lloyd and Frank Capra was already moving up the
00:17:04,00:17:11,room to collect it. I think he got to the stage and he then realised his mistake and he had
00:17:11,00:17:17,to walk all the way back in front of everybody. He later said the walk was the longest saddest
00:17:17,00:17:24,most shattering walk of my life. I wish I could have crawled under the rug like a miserable
00:17:24,00:17:35,worm. Okay we need to move on to fact number three and that is Chazinsky. My fight is that
00:17:35,00:17:41,houses in ancient Turkey had no doors or windows. You got in by climbing a ladder up to the
00:17:41,00:17:48,roof and dropping through a trap door. I just think this is so cool. So this is discovered
00:17:48,00:17:53,and this amazing settlement that archaeologists have uncovered in the last few years. It's
00:17:53,00:17:58,a settlement called Chathala Huyuk and it was settled over 9000 years ago. It's on the
00:17:58,00:18:05,Konya plain in Turkey and it's amazing and they all built their houses back to back sort
00:18:05,00:18:08,of clustered like you know terrorist houses which is very weird because they had lots
00:18:08,00:18:13,of room and no doors or windows and like little ladders that you could drop down to climb
00:18:13,00:18:17,up to get in and then you put the ladder down and you drop onto the hearth in the middle.
00:18:17,00:18:22,It's a bit weird because the entrance which you dropped through was the same as the exit
00:18:22,00:18:27,for the fire. So you wanted to make sure they didn't have a fire lit when you were coming
00:18:27,00:18:32,back home. I read a description of it. It's a bit like a honeycomb. So you have all these
00:18:32,00:18:36,like little cells that are next to each other so there's no path in between them. They're
00:18:36,00:18:40,all you've got like six neighbors one on each wall and the other way to get out is to go
00:18:40,00:18:43,"through the roof. And the streets were sort of the roots, weren't they? If you were going"
00:18:43,00:18:46,to someone's house you would just walk along the top and you would go down. So it was
00:18:46,00:18:51,a sort of as if it were an underground bunker but they just built it upwards and that
00:18:51,00:18:55,became their new street level. In fact they did everything on the roofs. So anything you
00:18:55,00:18:59,would do as a group so any kind of let's say you were doing some religious stuff it would
00:18:59,00:19:02,all have to happen on the roofs because that's all the space you had.
00:19:02,00:19:07,Half of the was one little area wasn't there where they defecated. Really? They had like
00:19:07,00:19:11,a courtyard where they would put all of their feces and their rubbish and all that kind
00:19:11,00:19:15,of stuff in a big midden. That's nice. We have one of those in the centre of Newcastle
00:19:15,00:19:22,don't we somewhere? But they lasted so they lasted a thousand seven hundred years. That
00:19:22,00:19:27,is such a lot when you really think about that. Just have a real think about that quickly.
00:19:27,00:19:35,That's a long time. Yeah it wasn't the same people. No. And then they disappeared. Yeah.
00:19:35,00:19:39,Well then they probably disappeared. We don't really know why. In about five thousand
00:19:39,00:19:44,BC I think it was. The civilization just don't know what happened to it but they do have
00:19:44,00:19:48,got amazing paintings that they found on the inside of their walls and they're always painting
00:19:48,00:19:52,sort of like leopards and bores and bears and also they always do those hand paintings which
00:19:52,00:19:56,I like because you always do them at primary school and it's nice that sort of cave people
00:19:56,00:20:01,did that too. And they have paintings they have this really cool painting of people but
00:20:01,00:20:06,without heads and then a huge one looks like a vulture and they think that's because they
00:20:06,00:20:10,did that thing when people died they would put them out on the roofs and no other animals
00:20:10,00:20:15,could get them but the vultures would carland be able to eat out their organs. So then they
00:20:15,00:20:20,would take the bodies which had no longer any meat on them so it's just a skeleton and
00:20:20,00:20:25,they would bury them in their houses under their beds. So you keep your grandma under your
00:20:25,00:20:37,bed. I've got to say I think we're getting it right and they didn't. In some ways here's
00:20:37,00:20:40,one thing that they did get right and one reason that people think they lasted so long is
00:20:40,00:20:46,because when we look at these cells now where they all lived they're almost exactly the same
00:20:46,00:20:50,and it's not like some of them have got more hand paints on or some of them have got more
00:20:50,00:20:54,decorations and stuff like that. And it seems that that is because they all basically
00:20:54,00:21:00,didn't have a way of accumulating goods. Everyone was exactly equal and one theory as to why
00:21:00,00:21:05,the way it died out in the end is because when they started farming people could start
00:21:05,00:21:09,hoarding food and then some people got richer than others and then eventually that's because
00:21:09,00:21:12,of the inequality that's why the civilization died.
00:21:12,00:21:17,"But they were one of the first, they're almost the most important agricultural communities"
00:21:17,00:21:20,early agricultural communities aren't they when people went from being nomadic to being
00:21:20,00:21:25,agricultural but weirdly their houses are nowhere near their fields which is quite confusing
00:21:25,00:21:28,because you would have thought if that's all you're doing you want your field to be next
00:21:28,00:21:30,to your house. But I think that's
00:21:30,00:21:35,because the clay to build their houses they wouldn't have been able to carry that from
00:21:35,00:21:39,wherever that was to next to the fields to build their houses. So instead they had to carry
00:21:39,00:21:43,their corn back to their houses. So their houses are built where the building materials
00:21:43,00:21:46,are. It's annoying to have to make that kind of trade off.
00:21:46,00:21:51,But it's much lighter to carry corn than it is to carry a house but you've got to carry
00:21:51,00:21:55,the house once. Exactly. Oh it's tricky isn't it?
00:21:55,00:22:00,"And you put it on the back of one of those trailers. What trailer? I'm sorry, what?"
00:22:00,00:22:10,"Have you heard about the people who lived in the Old Dubai Gorge in Tanzania? No, no,"
00:22:10,00:22:14,yeah fair enough. This is supposedly where the oldest houses in the
00:22:14,00:22:22,"world are and they're 1.8 million years old. So that's 1.5 million years, 1.5 million years"
00:22:22,00:22:27,older than humans are. There's circles of stone which are... they're not lovely houses
00:22:27,00:22:31,"okay, because obviously they're 1.8 million years old. There are circles of stones and they're"
00:22:31,00:22:36,surrounding slight depressions in the earth in the middle and that's about there about
00:22:36,00:22:43,13 feet across these circles. And some cynics have said these are not houses because they're
00:22:43,00:22:48,just circles of rocks. But you think how do the rocks get into circles? We don't know.
00:22:48,00:22:53,And there's a theory that maybe a growing tree pushed the rocks outwards into a circle
00:22:53,00:22:58,"then the tree died and it leaves a circle of rocks behind. That seems unlikely. That's silly,"
00:22:58,00:23:03,"yeah. But we don't know, but we don't know, but it's theory. They had presumably roofs."
00:23:03,00:23:05,They weren't just circles of stone at the time. We think or were there because if I just
00:23:05,00:23:12,"put a strewed a few pebbles around me and then said look, I've built a house. I don't"
00:23:12,00:23:16,think I'm being employed by any architectural firms. It's tricky because there's no definition
00:23:16,00:23:23,really of what a house is. Yeah. I got a fact about trapdoors because this was about getting
00:23:23,00:23:29,"into a trapdoor. So Russo, the French writer, had a trapdoor in his office for whenever he"
00:23:29,00:23:36,had unexpected guests. Was it to drop them through? He pressed a button. It was to him to
00:23:36,00:23:41,"flee and they'd knock on the door and say, I want to see if Mr. Russo is in. Oh no, sorry."
00:23:41,00:23:47,He's pulling the rug back over him for the trapdoor. I don't know. It's basically that Mark Zuckerberg
00:23:47,00:23:51,"has that as well. Really? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Generally, wow."
00:23:51,00:24:00,"Russo just locked his door. It's not as cool, is it? It's not as cool as the trapdoor."
00:24:00,00:24:06,It's not as cool. They found a few years back what they think is the oldest door in Europe
00:24:06,00:24:11,"and they think it's 5,000 years old and it was found when archaeologists in Zurich were"
00:24:11,00:24:16,"digging, I think it was for a car park and they suddenly found this door. Do you know how"
00:24:16,00:24:23,"they dated it? Someone had put a letter in there and they looked at the postman. Oh, yeah."
00:24:23,00:24:30,"They counted the rings. It was a long shot. Yeah. What a wooden door. It had rings. Yeah,"
00:24:30,00:24:34,"so they were able to count. Very good. I thought you sensed. Yeah, because you'd only know"
00:24:34,00:24:39,"from when it was born, the tree, right? Oh, this is 12 years old. They could have carbon"
00:24:39,00:24:51,"dated it, I guess, right? Yes. It's obviously the yet. Wait, they must. They did. Did they count"
00:24:51,00:24:54,"the rings? They counted the rings, but the rings obviously"
00:24:54,00:25:02,"had, but the tree was chosen. I don't know who wrote this bullshit. I'll tell you what,"
00:25:02,00:25:07,"when we do it in the office, it's embarrassing enough. In front of a thousand people. I really"
00:25:07,00:25:12,"have to question what's going on at this head of mind. Should we, another door, another"
00:25:12,00:25:20,door thing? Yeah. Quickly move on. Some Native American tribes and actually I think some
00:25:20,00:25:26,"East African tribes used to have keyhole-shaped doors. And this, why do you think that is?"
00:25:26,00:25:35,"Of keys. They had really huge keys. Really big kind of dresses, and so it was the shape"
00:25:35,00:25:40,"of them. Oh, that's right. Oh, like a lady's loose sign, which goes out like that, like"
00:25:40,00:25:45,a keyhole. They didn't have houses. They just had a load of lady's lavatories. Right.
00:25:45,00:25:53,"I get it, no, you're all incorrect. They counted the rings. It's the opposite of wearing"
00:25:53,00:25:58,"dresses. It's either, it's like if they were wearing dresses, but upside down. It's keyhole"
00:25:58,00:26:02,"shape because the top is much wider, and it's because people usually wouldn't want to carry"
00:26:02,00:26:07,"big bundles on their heads. And then when they're entering their house, the top is wider"
00:26:07,00:26:10,so that they can fit those bundles through. But you don't want to let all the heat out
00:26:10,00:26:16,"of your house. And so the bottom is much narrower, so you can have heat, very cool. We need to"
00:26:16,00:26:22,"move on to our final fact. Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show, and that is James."
00:26:22,00:26:29,"Okay, my fact this week is that the red triangle slug can escape from frogs by supergluing them"
00:26:29,00:26:37,"to trees. Ah, so cool. It is really cool. So I read the story in New Sciences quite recently."
00:26:37,00:26:49,There was a guy called John Gould from the University of Newcastle in Australia. And he
00:26:49,00:26:55,"made the discovery when he spotted a frog stuck to a tree. And there was a slug next to it,"
00:26:55,00:27:01,presumably kind of rubbing his hands with glue or something. And he cut a bit off the tree.
00:27:01,00:27:11,"He looked how old it was, and then he took it off. I believe it was. And then he took the frog"
00:27:11,00:27:15,"back to his lab, and he left it there for a while to see if it would get free, and it really"
00:27:15,00:27:21,"didn't. Eventually they prized it free, and they put it in a like a little container, and"
00:27:21,00:27:26,then it kept getting stuck to the sides of the container. And it turns out that this slug
00:27:26,00:27:31,"can get this kind of mucus, and it normally has a nice like slippery mucus that it can"
00:27:31,00:27:34,"travel on, but it can also make this really, really sticky mucus."
00:27:34,00:27:40,"Wait, so why did they get the frog? Did they then interview the frog? Would they tell us"
00:27:40,00:27:46,"how this happened? I was just trying to catch a slug, and it got all over my feet."
00:27:46,00:27:50,"But it is so weird, because it's so weird that the slug, because this is an amazing defense"
00:27:50,00:27:54,"mechanism, once it's superglue the frog to the tree, as you said, it just kind of hangs"
00:27:54,00:28:00,"out next to it's the thing that it slugged up. Wow, that is awesome. And it last days"
00:28:00,00:28:05,"doesn't it? Yeah, the glue. So they do get off, but it is a couple of days of what must"
00:28:05,00:28:11,"be horribly embarrassing sort of. Do the slugs invite their mates? Yeah, the other frogs"
00:28:11,00:28:14,"must be like, we're going to go catch that cool frog movie. Do you want to come? I'll be"
00:28:14,00:28:19,"there in a minute. You didn't get stuck, did you? I don't know, it feels like that would"
00:28:19,00:28:25,"be a thing. Yeah, probably. So this mucus is really good, because it's a very unusual"
00:28:25,00:28:32,"thing in that it's very glowy and very sticky, but as it gets wetter, it gets stickier. And"
00:28:32,00:28:36,"this is something that doesn't really happen usually when things dry out, they get, or they"
00:28:36,00:28:40,"adhere more. Like if you think about super glue, when it dries out, it's much more sticky."
00:28:40,00:28:44,"So this works better in wet conditions, and they think we might be able to use it, humans"
00:28:44,00:28:49,"might be able to use it for like fixing wounds, or there are similar ones that they use"
00:28:49,00:28:54,"to kind of put in people's hearts. If you have a lesion in your heart, you can hold"
00:28:54,00:28:57,"that together, because obviously a lot of blood around there and it works there. So this"
00:28:57,00:29:01,might be really useful for us in future. Or blasters that don't fall off in the sea.
00:29:01,00:29:09,"Yes. That's amazing. I'm down with, I'll fund that research. That is weird. That's why"
00:29:09,00:29:12,"when you get a slug slime on your hands, don't put water on it to wash it off because it"
00:29:12,00:29:17,"just makes it worse. Really? Is that right? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh, yeah, because slug slime,"
00:29:17,00:29:26,"it can kind of suck up water into it. So it just gets bigger. It drinks the water. Yeah,"
00:29:26,00:29:31,"it can do. So if you think about a slug, they like to be wet, don't they? They like to"
00:29:31,00:29:36,be moist. But then they're always giving out this slug slime all the time. So you think
00:29:36,00:29:40,they would just dry out. But what actually happens is some of that slug slime can take
00:29:40,00:29:43,"in the water because it just gets loads and loads of water in it, and it can actually"
00:29:43,00:29:48,almost drink through this slime. It's crazy. I was reading about banana slugs. They have
00:29:48,00:29:55,"a thing where sometimes when they have sex, the slime itself is so sticky that the male"
00:29:55,00:30:01,slugs penis will get stuck in there. And because it's just too sticky. So their only option
00:30:01,00:30:07,is they bite it off and just leave it. This is where Anna's German guy at the festival
00:30:07,00:30:19,got as ideas from. It's too sticky. It's got to go. Oh God. Yeah. Really? But they do sometimes
00:30:19,00:30:26,"bite each other's penises off anyway, I think. They're not really supposed to, but it's considered"
00:30:26,00:30:33,root. Sorry about it. I wasn't meant to do that. So they're all amaphyridites on this
00:30:33,00:30:36,"slug. So which is good. That means when they have sex, then both can go away pregnant,"
00:30:36,00:30:41,"which is nice. But they will at the end, you have to scamper really fast. Otherwise, your"
00:30:41,00:30:46,"partner might bite off your penis, which is a bit scary. But the best slug mating actually"
00:30:46,00:30:51,"is the leopard slug mating, isn't it? Because the leopard slug has sex while upside down"
00:30:51,00:30:57,hanging from a branch. And the reason it does this is because it's penis is so big that
00:30:57,00:31:09,it needs to use gravity to unroll it. We've all tried that line. My Tinder profile was me
00:31:09,00:31:16,"hanging upside down from a tree. I think you know what this means. This is amazing, though."
00:31:16,00:31:20,"They'll climb up a tree, two slugs on the side of their mating, and then they produce"
00:31:20,00:31:26,slime that can solidify really fast. So it acts like a bungee cord. So they drop down
00:31:26,00:31:31,"off a branch hanging from their slime. And then they unfold these penises, which are almost"
00:31:31,00:31:36,"as big as they are. They're really, really long. And they intertwine their own slug bodies,"
00:31:36,00:31:40,"which looks quite nice like a plant. And then they intertwine their own slug penises, which"
00:31:40,00:31:44,are sort of basically like extra slugs in the end if you look at it. It looks quite nice.
00:31:44,00:31:50,"And then they have sex. You've got such a low bar for what counts as nice, and I like"
00:31:50,00:31:55,"that. It's very pretty. And then when they're done, they eat their way back up the rope."
00:31:55,00:32:03,"Wow. Oh, that's a bit you're disgusted by. He got some weird standards in your castle."
00:32:03,00:32:07,"Oh, what I'm thinking of is that seen in Mission Impossible, now, where he's, is he slowly"
00:32:07,00:32:12,lowers himself down the rope? If he'd got his knob out at the bottom of that rope.
00:32:12,00:32:23,"What are you doing, Ethan? Sorry. I'll eat the rope and come back up."
00:32:23,00:32:30,"There's a thing that I like as well, just on the biting off of penis bed."
00:32:30,00:32:38,"Well, it's about losing body parts, and there's a thing that some slugs can do. There's sea"
00:32:38,00:32:42,"slugs that do this, certain sleas slugs, and there's tail dropper slugs. And what they do is,"
00:32:42,00:32:47,"if there's predator coming towards them, they basically just rip off a bit of their body"
00:32:47,00:32:52,in the tail dropper. It's the tail. And they use it as a decoy bit of bait. So they'll
00:32:52,00:32:57,"be like, go have that. And so the predator will eat that because it's not moving. And while"
00:32:57,00:33:02,"they're munching on the bit of that body, the rest of them can get away. It's not exactly"
00:33:02,00:33:06,right there. I think we mentioned there's a scorpion that does that.
00:33:06,00:33:11,"Oh, yeah, there is one. It breaks off its tail. Well, the problem is it breaks off its anus."
00:33:11,00:33:16,Yes. And then it can't poo anymore. And it can't have a poo ever again. And the poo
00:33:16,00:33:19,just sort of builds up in its body because it's thrown away its tail. So it doesn't get
00:33:19,00:33:24,"eaten, but then three days later it dies of constipation. Yeah. Does it really? Yeah. They"
00:33:24,00:33:29,"don't explode. Yeah, they do die. I wonder if they regress it. I guess you've, you've"
00:33:29,00:33:33,"then, it's then like another mission impossible film. You've got three days left to pass on your"
00:33:33,00:33:40,jeep. But it's quite hard to attract female scorpions because you're getting bigger and
00:33:40,00:33:46,"bigger full of poo. Yeah. Yeah. So that's an exciting pitch, I think, for a film. Ethan"
00:33:46,00:33:58,Hunt has thrown away his own ass. So I've actually been looking at glue and gluing things. Do

00:34:51,00:34:59,"by the relatively simple method of taking off his jacket. Okay, that's it. That is all"
