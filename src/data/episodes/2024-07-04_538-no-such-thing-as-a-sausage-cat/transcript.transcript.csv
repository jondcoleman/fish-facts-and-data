00:00:39,00:00:44,We should say includes lots of actually very funny bits. We don't put into the panel show better in many ways
00:00:44,00:00:48,You just need to go to no such thing as a fish dot com slash live
00:00:48,00:00:52,All the tickets are available there some of them have sold out already some of them
00:00:52,00:00:58,"There are some tickets left for so go go go hurry now. All right, that's it on with the show open the podcast"
00:00:58,00:01:21,Hello and welcome to another episode of no such thing as a fish a weekly podcast coming to you from the QI officers in Hoburn
00:01:21,00:01:26,My name is Dan Schreiber. I am sitting here with James Harkin and Anna Tushinsky and Andrew Hunter Murray
00:01:26,00:01:31,"But once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days"
00:01:31,00:01:38,And in no particular order here we go starting with fact number one and that is Andy
00:01:38,00:01:43,My fact is that British elections couldn't go ahead without a device called the spanker
00:01:43,00:01:47,"Without it, we wouldn't have any conservative MPs"
00:01:49,00:01:53,"Actually, we're recording this two weeks before the election and at the moment it looks like we might not have any"
00:01:53,00:01:58,"Yes, so we don't know the result so really it could go either way"
00:01:58,00:02:03,"I personally think they've got it in the bag, but whatever so this is not an election special also"
00:02:03,00:02:06,"We should say that shouldn't we? Yes, it is a quarter of an election special"
00:02:06,00:02:09,Don't worry basically if you just tuned in the morning after the election thinking
00:02:09,00:02:12,"Oh, it's nice and just facts about what wasps or something this is only this bit"
00:02:12,00:02:16,But this is very exciting for you because you're listening to the only four people who don't know the result
00:02:18,00:02:21,I can't believe they didn't know at that point that Donald Trump is going to become the prime minister
00:02:21,00:02:23,How did that even happen?
00:02:23,00:02:29,So I've been reading a lot about the election and this was a feature about literally the stuff that needs to make it happen
00:02:29,00:02:35,You know that the the polling booths and the ballot boxes and all of that and it's about this company called Shaw and Sun
00:02:35,00:02:43,"Who have been making election equipment since 1750? Wow, I mean that's before even mass enfranchisement of the vote"
00:02:43,00:02:46,"Wow, that's amazing. Ed, was it always like boxes and stuff?"
00:02:46,00:02:52,I'm not sure what the very earliest stuff was but these days they do about a hundred and sixty thousand little stuffy pencils per
00:02:52,00:02:56,"Election that's brilliant. I always thought they just got those from our goss. Well, they're like baby carrots"
00:02:56,00:03:01,It's that you get a normal size pencil. You have to shave it down. It takes ages
00:03:01,00:03:04,"Oh, they're not specially bred. They're not a different species"
00:03:04,00:03:13,"That's why this company is coining it in can I ask what a spanker is? Yes, it's a very very dull thing"
00:03:13,00:03:18,"It's a long ruler with a hole in the end, right? And what you do is"
00:03:18,00:03:24,You stick that into the ballot box and you use it to mash down the votes
00:03:24,00:03:30,So if your ballot box is already then you just give the old spanker a bit of a spanko and it just crams them down in a box
00:03:30,00:03:34,Do we have the etymology? Why such a sexy name?
00:03:34,00:03:38,I guess it's patting it down like you might
00:03:38,00:03:42,"Spanking as a force, isn't it? It's like a whack"
00:03:42,00:03:48,"That's true. You know the word spanker originally meant just something great. Did it? Yeah, just that's a spanker"
00:03:48,00:03:55,"Nice car went past. That's a spanker. I like that. Well, my my brand spanking new. Yes"
00:03:55,00:04:02,"Yeah, it was and it was a gold coin between 1663 and 1785 if you said that you had a spanker"
00:04:02,00:04:06,"And then you had a gold coin in your pocket. Oh, is that a spanker in your pocket?"
00:04:08,00:04:15,One thing I didn't realize is now obviously this no one saw this election coming except maybe maybe a couple of people
00:04:15,00:04:19,But we don't know if they've got premonition abilities
00:04:19,00:04:23,We don't know what the mystical side of them is but no one knew this was coming
00:04:23,00:04:28,And this is a nightmare for all of these companies that are running these elections because the UK is basically
00:04:28,00:04:30,650 individual elections
00:04:30,00:04:36,So everyone has to run around and make sure they have the stubby little pencils that they have the ballot boxes that they have
00:04:36,00:04:39,"Everything ready, but it's even physical venues, you know"
00:04:39,00:04:45,People are like having their weddings in certain places in halls that you suddenly are needed on this on this day
00:04:45,00:04:51,"You know, so the hecticness of the count is it's quite a thing in Britain and it's also a thing that is"
00:04:51,00:04:57,"Not true of all countries, right? It's quite weird that we still have human beings counting through votes"
00:04:57,00:05:02,You know in America think almost everyone does some form of electronic voting in lots of other countries
00:05:03,00:05:06,And we've mentioned before the most exciting
00:05:06,00:05:13,Results that you guys listening will know and we don't which is who won out of Sunland and Newcastle in the race to see who declares
00:05:13,00:05:19,"The first constituency, but did you know there is a third, you know a reform equivalent coming up on the inside?"
00:05:19,00:05:26,"Is there is it? Let's say it must be Hartley-Poole or Durham or it's got to be somewhere up there, hasn't it?"
00:05:26,00:05:30,It is somewhere up there. Well done James. Why do you say that? Well because the other two are up there
00:05:31,00:05:33,It's
00:05:33,00:05:42,"Sort of because of that yeah, because it seems that it's the brainchild of one single man who did this and it's a guy called Bill Crawford and"
00:05:42,00:05:45,He was head of elections at Sunderland council in 1992
00:05:45,00:05:49,He thought let's make Sunderland famous for always declaring first the vote
00:05:49,00:05:54,So for internationalists they always take about an hour and a half to count all the votes and it's very exciting because they win
00:05:54,00:06:01,"But anyway, we mentioned that Newcastle then won in 2017 and 2019, but that was because Bill Crawford had changed councils"
00:06:01,00:06:05,So he went to Newcastle and he masterminded their victory
00:06:05,00:06:11,That's amazing and is Bill gone somewhere else now? He's gone somewhere else. Has he? He has gone to Ashington and Blythe
00:06:11,00:06:13,Which I believe is one of the new constituencies
00:06:13,00:06:19,"After all the redrawing and it's in Northumberland. Yeah, they are and they've changed all of the"
00:06:19,00:06:24,"Constituencies now haven't they yeah, the boundaries are not really interesting, but the reason they've done it is to try and make"
00:06:24,00:06:29,"The number of people in each constituency more level. I think yeah, that's the idea"
00:06:29,00:06:35,So they want every constituency to have between sixty nine thousand and seventy seven thousand voters in it
00:06:35,00:06:40,But what interesting thing about that is in the United States the Congress has
00:06:40,00:06:43,435 members
00:06:43,00:06:51,But there was an amendment in the Constitution that was going to say that every districts had to have a maximum of fifty thousand citizens
00:06:51,00:06:57,"Okay, they never put this amendment in okay, but if they had then the current US Congress would have to have at least"
00:06:57,00:07:00,"6,600 members"
00:07:00,00:07:03,"Can I tell you about a candidate? This is I love this, okay?"
00:07:03,00:07:06,"So, you know you get on your ballot paper"
00:07:06,00:07:10,Like there are some main parties then a few others depending on where in the country you are there might be some local ones
00:07:10,00:07:15,"Like the SMP or whatever and there might be a couple of independence as well. Yeah, and especially in the"
00:07:15,00:07:21,"Sort of senior like the Prime Minister seat. There'll be sort of 12 candidates. Yeah, and there are like monster raving loony"
00:07:21,00:07:25,"Yeah, exactly. Well, I just love this. Okay in the 1994"
00:07:25,00:07:32,This wasn't a biggie actually there's European elections. I was in Devon Richard Huggett stood for a party
00:07:32,00:07:37,That he called the literal Democrats brilliant right as opposed to the liberal Democrats
00:07:37,00:07:42,Thank you for making the comparison for us for international listeners who might not have heard of the Lib Dems
00:07:42,00:07:49,Maybe they're huge in Chattanooga. I don't know but who's not heard of our new Prime Minister's party
00:07:49,00:07:59,"But the literal Democrats he got 10,000 votes because people just read oh, yeah, that must be that's they just misread it"
00:07:59,00:08:01,"Oh, I think it's illegal to do that as well"
00:08:01,00:08:06,He was responsible. He's probably the only independent MP who's ever got a law changed because thanks to him
00:08:06,00:08:10,The law was changed because the actual Lib Dems lost that seat by 700 votes
00:08:10,00:08:16,"Oh, wow, they would have won it were it not for the 10,000 to vote it for him. Wow, so he got so they claim"
00:08:16,00:08:20,So you now cannot do that that's crazy
00:08:20,00:08:27,So someone was saying that if Queen Victoria sort of time traveled to today and went to a polling booth
00:08:27,00:08:34,It wouldn't look alien to her it would look exactly like how she would have remembered it because 80% of all of the principles
00:08:34,00:08:37,That was set out in the ballot act in 1872 are the same
00:08:37,00:08:40,So you think those people outside doing selfies with the dogs that was the same
00:08:40,00:08:45,So that would be that would be a bit confusing but once she's inside with a little pencil. She's like I'm home
00:08:45,00:08:48,She's gonna say what are all these women doing here?
00:08:48,00:08:55,"So if you go to this website by the way shore and sons the company that did oh, yeah"
00:08:55,00:08:58,I'm lucky you can just buy this stuff. You can buy yourself a spanker if you like for 5.95
00:08:58,00:09:03,You really which I think is probably cheaper than a lot of other shops might charge you for a spanker
00:09:03,00:09:09,"Yeah, but I mean you can get also you can get a basic kit you can buy a sign saying you may use your own pen"
00:09:09,00:09:11,What would you?
00:09:11,00:09:16,"It's only you and your wife in your house, isn't it? Yeah, why might you want a ballot box?"
00:09:16,00:09:19,"Oh, what's for tea tonight?"
00:09:19,00:09:23,All sorts of things. I would love that in fact I might buy it
00:09:23,00:09:27,"Yeah, there are two weeks to go to the election. So I might actually buy some stuff for the house like you know abuse"
00:09:27,00:09:29,That's another sign you could buy. I'd love to buy one of those
00:09:29,00:09:37,Do you remember I absolutely walked into a primary school during the Brexit referendum
00:09:37,00:09:41,I was going to vote
00:09:41,00:09:47,And they were singing in out
00:09:49,00:09:54,That's the problem I was looking for where I needed to go and vote and I knew it was on this road
00:09:54,00:10:00,But I didn't see where and there was a sign that said out and then there was another sign that said in a bit further down
00:10:00,00:10:04,"And I was like, okay, here we go. So I went inside and they went. What are you doing here?"
00:10:04,00:10:08,"And I was like, I'm just here to vote and they said this is a school and I said, I'm sorry the signs outside"
00:10:08,00:10:13,They said that's for cars. That's the car park. That's an in sign and an outside
00:10:13,00:10:16,So you don't drive in the wrong spot tragedy your vote to shake it all about
00:10:17,00:10:19,Declan invalid
00:10:19,00:10:27,Funny it was embarrassing and Sean Kemp who was the head of press for lit Dems in 2010
00:10:27,00:10:35,Said that for party leaders dignity has to be less important than coverage sometimes
00:10:35,00:10:39,Lessons have been taken on by the current
00:10:39,00:10:45,Because for people outside the UK the main part of this campaign for me
00:10:45,00:10:51,Is that when you look at the news? It's like labor talk about the latest tax or the
00:10:51,00:10:58,Conservatives say how they're gonna stop migration and then it's a Davey the leader of the Lib Dems goes bungee jumping with mr.
00:10:58,00:11:00,Blobby
00:11:00,00:11:04,But this has been the technique for at least 15 years
00:11:04,00:11:10,"Yeah, so Nick Clegg went to go ape and did a lip-sync with Kylie rage absence. I really like you"
00:11:11,00:11:16,Don't remember that but the main king of it was the head of the Scottish Lib Dems called Willie Rennie
00:11:16,00:11:20,Once he was in a farm and he was talking about some I don't know
00:11:20,00:11:26,Wind farms or something and he wasn't really sure why he was there and he said I don't know how but it certainly does
00:11:26,00:11:31,Help in some way someone somewhere will work it out and work out why we're here
00:11:31,00:11:35,"He was said this in an interview, but while he was saying it there were two pigs having sex behind it"
00:11:37,00:11:45,It's the most amazing video you've ever seen and it became so notorious that the courier evening telegraph even reported when the pigs died a
00:11:45,00:11:47,Few years later because they became so famous
00:11:47,00:11:49,and the idea is that
00:11:49,00:11:56,They think that the the press who kind of go around with all these politics are always really grumpy and they always think they're in
00:11:56,00:12:00,The wrong place because who cares what the Lib Dems say they want to be where the action is happening
00:12:00,00:12:04,And so they have to put on all these things to kind of keep the press happy
00:12:04,00:12:11,"So I'm super fun. Yeah, I mean his tour bus is like champagne is given out and party poppers and then you know"
00:12:11,00:12:14,They all get to go down waterslides naked with not naked
00:12:14,00:12:20,"Trunks with him for me. Yeah, Davey has been an advert for how great Britain can be"
00:12:20,00:12:24,He's just done all the most fun stuff in Britain. He's secretly working for the British tourist board
00:12:24,00:12:30,I went on to so like you went on to the website to buy all of that paraphernalia
00:12:31,00:12:37,"Yeah, the smaker and so on I went on to the major political party websites to look at their stores to see if there's any fun stuff"
00:12:37,00:12:39,"That you can get as well much. Yeah, they're merch stores"
00:12:39,00:12:45,And they do have a few things that they're trying to have a sense of humor with so for example on the conservative site
00:12:45,00:12:49,"You can buy a pair of Cure Starmer flip-flops, so you've got his face on them"
00:12:49,00:12:55,You will see flip flip between policies all the time. Can you also buy a massive bin fire from there?
00:12:56,00:13:01,"Well, what's interesting is it's only made me realize that it's a very different culture here in Britain too"
00:13:01,00:13:07,it is in the States where you have so much merch that comes out during an election and
00:13:07,00:13:12,They they print so much with the hope of the expectation the person's gonna get in and continue to sell
00:13:12,00:13:16,But what happens when they lose what happens when they have to drop out?
00:13:16,00:13:22,What do you do with all this merch and apparently for years after the 2012 election in Kenya?
00:13:22,00:13:25,You could see kids just walking around with Mitt Romney t-shirts and hats
00:13:25,00:13:33,"Thousands were sent over there. And so yeah, so they have to just redistribute all of these things that yeah, it's pretty extraordinary"
00:13:33,00:13:36,"I was on custom condoms.co.uk. Oh, yeah"
00:13:36,00:13:45,You were also on there and the user is currently looking at this condom
00:13:45,00:13:50,"We've been bidding against each other for that one condom, haven't we?"
00:13:51,00:13:54,I won't go at any of our 59p
00:13:54,00:14:02,"Selling condoms with political jokes on them. No, it's not practical jokes"
00:14:02,00:14:15,"So they have like Rishi no Rashi. Oh, yeah to protect you from STDs"
00:14:16,00:14:20,We're Fakir or Ed Davey makes my legs go wavy
00:14:20,00:14:31,"Anyway, the really interesting thing about this is they also have a poll on the website about how many they've sold and"
00:14:31,00:14:40,At the time of research labor on 34.2 percent the Tories were on 19.4 percent reformer on 15.6 percent
00:14:40,00:14:42,And the Lib Dems are on 10.3 percent
00:14:43,00:14:47,Which is almost exactly as the actual polls are. It's insane
00:14:47,00:14:51,The only difference is that the Green Party are on 14.1
00:14:51,00:14:56,So if you give 7% of their vote to labor it is pretty much exactly as the same as the polls
00:14:56,00:14:57,Wow
00:14:57,00:15:03,It's that amazing. A great graphic at the end would be if they actually put the condom onto three people's penises
00:15:03,00:15:05,But they are the right height
00:15:07,00:15:12,"When gone erect, let's see who's won. That's the Channel 4 swingometer this year"
00:15:12,00:15:23,"Okay, it is time for fact number two and that is James"
00:15:23,00:15:31,"Okay, my fact this week is that the Never Pink movement refers to hunters in the US who refuse to wear pink clothing"
00:15:31,00:15:36,Even though it gives them more chance of shooting their prey and makes them less likely to be shot themselves
00:15:37,00:15:44,So by not wearing pink they're less likely to catch anything and they're more likely to be shot by a fellow hunter exactly
00:15:44,00:15:49,But their mates might take the piss out of them because they're wearing pink and that's why they refuse to do it
00:15:49,00:15:52,"Oh, actually, there's a few reasons that we might get to but is it a political thing"
00:15:52,00:15:59,Is it like pinko's the communist thing or is it just a girly color? I'm afraid it's more of like a homosexual
00:15:59,00:16:06,I see girly thing although actually there are a group of women Never Pinkers
00:16:06,00:16:10,And reason for a lot of them is they just get annoyed that you know
00:16:10,00:16:14,Why should we wear pink just because we're women right because some of these pink things
00:16:14,00:16:18,"They try and sell them to women and they think well, we should wear the same as everyone"
00:16:18,00:16:21,"So you might be mistaken also for a flamingo actually, so yes"
00:16:21,00:16:28,It's amazing that as part of the research that they cite why pink is better is that pink is
00:16:28,00:16:33,"Supposedly less visible to the animals that they're hunting. Yeah, it's deer specifically"
00:16:34,00:16:36,And it's compared to orange
00:16:36,00:16:43,So most states in America say that you have to wear some kind of hives and they'll say it's either orange or pink
00:16:43,00:16:44,Or it might be other things
00:16:44,00:16:50,But basically the choice for these hunters is between orange and pink and they much more prefer to go for orange
00:16:50,00:16:55,"And this I should say came from an article in the Wall Street Journal by John Clark, which I read about this"
00:16:55,00:17:01,Here's a cool thing about pink you can tell where a salmon is from by the hue of its flesh
00:17:02,00:17:05,"So we've mentioned before that salmon are pink because of the things they eat, right?"
00:17:05,00:17:09,And
00:17:09,00:17:15,But the different species of salmon they all have different diets which are heavier or lighter in
00:17:15,00:17:18,The krill of the shrimp that give them that hue
00:17:18,00:17:23,"So if you're an Alaskan sockeye salmon, you'll be a very deep red because you live near the Bering Sea"
00:17:23,00:17:25,Which is full of krill that's interesting
00:17:25,00:17:29,But if you're a king salmon you eat relatively less of that stuff and you'll be much paler
00:17:29,00:17:33,I think the problem is though that they just put colouring in salmon these days
00:17:33,00:17:39,"Don't they? No, they don't put colouring but they farm salmon and feed them deliberately pink stuff to make them more pink than they would"
00:17:39,00:17:45,"Yes, they would be it would be a lot more gray and less appetizing looking to us. Yeah, pink's an amazing colour"
00:17:45,00:17:52,"I've never really thought about pink too much, but as far as science knows at the moment, it's the oldest colour on earth"
00:17:52,00:17:54,Okay
00:17:54,00:17:57,"That's the oldest colour. Yes, it was in black and white at some point"
00:17:57,00:18:11,"Yeah, basically a few years back they crushed a 1.1 billion-year-old rock that they found beneath the Sahara Desert and"
00:18:11,00:18:18,"That produced pink and that's the oldest colour that we now know of. Okay. Yeah, so cool"
00:18:19,00:18:26,"Weirdly the oldest colour, but also get ready to be upset chemist, physicist, scientist. It's not a colour"
00:18:26,00:18:34,"Well, I, people get annoyed when you say this, but it's not a colour. It's not on the spectrum, right?"
00:18:34,00:18:38,"You look at the spectrum red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet, a rainbow"
00:18:38,00:18:42,Pink isn't in there and this does make it really special
00:18:42,00:18:46,"So the way our eyes merge other colours, right, as we see a specific wavelength"
00:18:46,00:18:52,So you'll see a specific wavelength for blue or a specific wavelength for red or for green
00:18:52,00:18:56,"And then if you're seeing two different colours, you'll see the average of those wavelengths"
00:18:56,00:19:02,"So if you see red and yellow, the average of those two wavelengths is orange. So you see that, but"
00:19:02,00:19:04,when we see pink
00:19:04,00:19:09,It's actually because we're seeing the shortest wavelength and the longest wavelength
00:19:09,00:19:14,So we're saying red at one end of the rainbow and then like a violet blue at the other end
00:19:14,00:19:18,"And if you've got the average of them, it would be like green in the middle of the rainbow"
00:19:18,00:19:21,Which doesn't really make any sense. So our brain invents a new colour
00:19:21,00:19:28,"So pink isn't on the spectrum. The way you can tell this, this is an exciting experiment you can do, which I find so cool"
00:19:28,00:19:33,Type in magenta circle or go on to Microsoft Word and draw yourself a magenta circle
00:19:33,00:19:36,Stare at that circle for a minute
00:19:36,00:19:40,"And first of all, what you'll see is it goes green around the edge, which is super cool"
00:19:40,00:19:44,"And then if you stare at it for a minute, if you look at the white space on the page next to it"
00:19:44,00:19:49,You'll see a green circle and that's because that's like the inverse of pink
00:19:49,00:19:51,Like the negative kind of thing
00:19:51,00:19:54,"Right, and if you stare at it for a minute longer, it tells you who the zodiac kill it"
00:19:54,00:20:01,"But you're wearing a pink watch and you're trying to say basically that colour doesn't, it's brain fabricated"
00:20:01,00:20:08,"Yeah, and others like brown is a little bit, but pink is the most obvious and most round the other side of the spectrum"
00:20:08,00:20:12,"Yeah, brown's not on the spectrum either. No, I know and that's another example of an extra spectral colour"
00:20:12,00:20:15,It's just not quite as fun as pink. Maybe the spectrum is not as helpful
00:20:15,00:20:18,"Do you know what I mean? Yeah, I'm with you"
00:20:18,00:20:24,Maybe the spectrum is not a good way of thinking about it. That is just nature though. The spectrum is just the reality
00:20:24,00:20:28,I guess I'm defining colour as something with a wavelength and pink doesn't have a wavelength
00:20:28,00:20:32,"Okay, I was reading about just the effect that pink can have on us"
00:20:32,00:20:36,there's this shade of pink called Baker Miller pink and
00:20:37,00:20:42,It's been given a big claim that it's a pink that if you stare at or if you're surrounded by it calms you down
00:20:42,00:20:47,So it was based on some old research which has not been replicated
00:20:47,00:20:51,"However, people kind of don't care in jails around the world like in switzerland"
00:20:51,00:20:56,They will paint this Baker Miller pink everywhere because they believe that if you're in its presence
00:20:56,00:21:02,It takes out all your aggression and it just absolutely winds you down and they also use it in sport
00:21:02,00:21:09,So you have football teams like Norwich City Football Club who will paint the visiting teams locker room
00:21:09,00:21:13,Entirely pink so that when they get in their aggression is taken out
00:21:13,00:21:16,And they're not as feisty for the match and even though we don't even know if it's true
00:21:16,00:21:20,It does affect the mentality of people so in america and american football
00:21:20,00:21:21,They do this as well
00:21:21,00:21:28,And you'll have the coaches coming in getting furious about one pink room and he'll like put white paper all over the walls
00:21:28,00:21:34,So that is players don't get influenced by this calming color. It could definitely have an effect because let's say
00:21:34,00:21:39,"Well, first of all the away team might think oh, no, it's pink. I'm going to be less aggressive"
00:21:39,00:21:43,"So they might just naturally think yeah, but also the home team might think"
00:21:43,00:21:48,"We've given them the pink dressing room that will make us better and it would just make you, you know"
00:21:48,00:21:53,"Psychologically play better. Yeah, psyops. It's all sort of what's it called psychosomatic. Yeah"
00:21:53,00:21:57,"If you're the home team, it's good for you to know that and then you have to give the away team"
00:21:57,00:22:00,"Who are visiting you a pamphlet explaining? Yeah. Yeah, actually did you know that?"
00:22:00,00:22:04,"And that's they leave the room you just quickly whisper to each one of them, you know, that's not even a color"
00:22:04,00:22:08,And it just psychologically
00:22:08,00:22:12,You know that song that chelsea sing blue is the color they used to sing blue is a color
00:22:12,00:22:15,Unlike pink of course
00:22:15,00:22:20,And a lot of other teams use different things in their dressing rooms instead of this pink color
00:22:20,00:22:25,So uh burnley fc used to turn the temperature up in the away dressing room to make everyone sweat
00:22:27,00:22:32,They also make the away dressing room door smaller than normal making the players sort of hunch down as they
00:22:32,00:22:35,"That would have the opposite effect on me because I think gosh, I'm big and tall and mighty"
00:22:35,00:22:39,"Like giving them all a half point. They think wow, I'm huge"
00:22:39,00:22:43,In arsenal according to legend
00:22:43,00:22:45,They have a table in the middle of the dressing room
00:22:45,00:22:49,"Which is such a height that wherever the manager stood some of the people won't be able to see them. Oh, wow"
00:22:49,00:22:56,How tall is this table? So you're sat down like you're sat down on benches. Yeah
00:22:57,00:23:02,And it'll be like halfway up the room is this big sort of like of us like a kitchen counter
00:23:02,00:23:04,That's great
00:23:04,00:23:11,"In liverpool, apparently they would polish the floor really an awful lot in the away dressing room"
00:23:11,00:23:14,So that um players would have to tip to around so they didn't slip
00:23:14,00:23:16,And they put banana peel all over it
00:23:16,00:23:19,"One more of these. Oh, yeah"
00:23:19,00:23:24,"Chelsea fc apparently made the mirrors in the away dressing room, you know like those holes of mirrors"
00:23:26,00:23:28,Make you really tall or really small or whatever
00:23:28,00:23:34,They made them making it look like the away players were smaller than they are and the home players were bigger than they are
00:23:34,00:23:38,I should say this was all according to an article in the sun about olly's
00:23:38,00:23:40,"Okay, right"
00:23:40,00:23:43,"That's a great collection. Well, that's fun. Pink ladies"
00:23:43,00:23:49,"Uh from greece. I'm actually thinking of the apples. Oh, pink lady apple"
00:23:49,00:23:51,But it's it's actually I believe several different kinds of apple
00:23:51,00:23:55,Is it but they're grouped it's like how when you order scampi you're getting any old
00:23:55,00:23:58,"Stuff, you know, it's just got bachelor on it and it's from the sea basically"
00:23:58,00:24:01,"I mean, there is a main one which is called krips pink"
00:24:01,00:24:04,Uh after
00:24:04,00:24:06,"Like how children say crisps. Uh, no"
00:24:06,00:24:10,"It's after the gang the krip. No, it's not it's um"
00:24:10,00:24:15,John krips who was a sort of apollographer from uh apollologist
00:24:15,00:24:20,"Yeah, an apollographer story is someone who draws apples or writes the biographies of apples"
00:24:20,00:24:25,"Well, this this guy was in a way doing that because he was breeding the apples"
00:24:25,00:24:31,It took him decades to get the pink lady perfect because they originated in australia because they need really high temperatures to grow and
00:24:31,00:24:33,to become perfect
00:24:33,00:24:39,"And um, he died in 2022. He was nearly 100 years old. I think when he died get on in all those apples. Yeah, a couple of days exactly"
00:24:39,00:24:44,"Yeah, I like a pink lady actually. I thought about you guys. I think it's my favorite apple. It's my favorite apple"
00:24:44,00:24:50,"Yeah, I love it. It's objectively the best apple guys and I think it's just I mean, it's obviously rock hard"
00:24:50,00:24:54,It's nice and sour and I like to not like a pink lady
00:24:55,00:24:57,I actually like a braven
00:24:57,00:24:59,Oh the lesser appreciated
00:24:59,00:25:04,"Despite having just said the pink lady is the best. Yeah, you like the one that is less in my heart of hearts"
00:25:04,00:25:07,I know pink lady is the best. It's also the most expensive and i'm very stingy
00:25:07,00:25:10,So i'll save that 25p and go for the braven
00:25:10,00:25:15,"I objectively know that man's city are the best football team, but that doesn't stop me from supporting tremere rovers"
00:25:15,00:25:17,Exactly braven is my jam here
00:25:17,00:25:21,"Um, do you know we invented pink pigs?"
00:25:22,00:25:28,"Did we? Yeah, okay. Yeah, what were they before? So they won. Yeah wild pigs aren't pink. Yeah, we're brown"
00:25:28,00:25:30,So we're from one non-color to another non-color
00:25:30,00:25:35,Pigs don't exist. That's why they have no predators in the natural world. Nothing can see hardly
00:25:35,00:25:40,"No, we we bred them to be pink and we're not really sure why it's when humans started breeding animals for farming"
00:25:40,00:25:43,And we assume it's just because we like bright fun colors
00:25:43,00:25:48,And they wouldn't survive in the wild as pink because they are quite visible and obviously pink is not a very good disguise color
00:25:48,00:25:53,"And they get sunburned as well, don't they and they do get sunburned exactly because pink means they've got no melanin"
00:25:53,00:25:55,That's wild. No
00:25:55,00:26:01,"I was looking up pink slang as well. Oh, yeah from jonathan green's fantastic"
00:26:01,00:26:08,"Dictionary of slang. Yeah, we've referred to a few times before. I think it's it's amazing pink cigar"
00:26:08,00:26:18,The penis oh is it pink oboe is this all gonna be the penis no playing the pink oboe does feel like masturbating
00:26:18,00:26:25,"That's his penis the pink pink panatella like a panatella cigar. Oh, is it the italian version of the pink pan?"
00:26:25,00:26:27,I'm afraid it's the penis
00:26:27,00:26:30,Um pink torpedo. Yeah
00:26:30,00:26:32,He's the next
00:26:32,00:26:37,"Pink finger next it's a skinhead actually a pink finger. Oh, yeah, okay. Yeah, right"
00:26:37,00:26:40,"Unfortunately, it means skinhead but skinhead means penis"
00:26:40,00:26:46,Um pink trumpet. I must be I mean they're all penis pink steel
00:26:47,00:26:50,"Pink steel. Yeah, penis. Um pink palace"
00:26:50,00:26:53,"Uh, that's a vagina. It certainly is"
00:26:53,00:26:57,Pink what pinken the pinken the pinken pinken pinken that
00:26:57,00:27:04,"That's that's no, that's the financial times needs faith. Oh, yeah, the pink one. Yeah, yeah, the pink one. So there you go"
00:27:04,00:27:09,"So it's mostly it's mostly penis. Yeah, yeah, unless it's the financial times"
00:27:09,00:27:11,It's not the financial times in your pocket
00:27:11,00:27:23,"Okay, it is time for fact number three and that is my fact"
00:27:23,00:27:30,My fact this week is that monks working at the 2800 year old buddhist temple daigoji in japan
00:27:30,00:27:35,Maintain a five-story pagoda a cherry blossom garden and a space program
00:27:38,00:27:41,"Space program. Yeah, is it up there with the u.s. And um,"
00:27:41,00:27:45,"China space programs. This is uh, it's it's a slow start"
00:27:45,00:27:51,They're going to be sending one small satellite up that measures 20 centimeters in length and 30 centimeters in width
00:27:51,00:27:54,You weren't even very small monk on that. No
00:27:54,00:28:01,"This is yeah, this is a this is a heritage place in in um kiyoto"
00:28:01,00:28:07,"And the monks there have become very interested in the idea of if you know, for example that a temple in space is flying"
00:28:07,00:28:10,Over you can track it and you can pray to that temple
00:28:10,00:28:14,So it's it's a sort of even for wandering monks and so on
00:28:14,00:28:20,"To be able to pray to whenever the iss goes over. Yeah, we always get a tiresome person like me going. Oh, look, that's"
00:28:20,00:28:27,"A star that looks like it's moving. That's the iss actually. Yeah, but instead we'd be like now we all meditate"
00:28:27,00:28:29,"Yeah, exactly. Now it's a meditation thing"
00:28:29,00:28:33,So they have teamed up with a satellite developer called terra space ink
00:28:34,00:28:37,Who were also based in kiyoto and it was meant to go up in 2023
00:28:37,00:28:41,"It hasn't been launched yet, but it's still they're they're doing tons of talks about it and so on"
00:28:41,00:28:45,"So it sounds like it's still on the cards, but yeah, that's their that's very cool"
00:28:45,00:28:49,"That's their plan. Yeah, and it said that priests will give space services"
00:28:49,00:28:52,"I mean, is that just like doing something over zoom?"
00:28:52,00:28:56,Is does that mean the priest in the temple on the ground a romantic way of looking at it?
00:28:56,00:28:59,"I mean, yes, it's technically like doing something over zoom"
00:29:01,00:29:06,We're gonna already communicate with far flung temples all the south wise Elon musk has put up there
00:29:06,00:29:12,I really like it. I think it's awesome. It's it is a bit confusing about how the operation is going to work at the moment
00:29:12,00:29:15,Largely because the articles are just translated from a local source
00:29:15,00:29:18,So it's we haven't got in depth on it yet as far as I know
00:29:18,00:29:21,But inside the temple that it's going to be in space the satellite
00:29:21,00:29:25,They're going to include a buddhist statue and a mandala painting or a few of those
00:29:26,00:29:31,"Mandala Mandala Mandala Mandala. No, no Nelson Mandala is uh, yeah, no a mandala painting"
00:29:31,00:29:37,"Yeah, that will be within this tiny little really. Yeah, which we should probably say what mandala painting is"
00:29:37,00:29:42,"Yeah, it's like one of those geometric circles like a lot of different colors"
00:29:42,00:29:45,"Yeah, it's like kind of but it's a circle, but it means something in buddhism"
00:29:45,00:29:50,It's a sort of holy symbol of eternity. Is it I'm going I have a few of them at home
00:29:50,00:29:53,"Yeah, which I have absolutely no idea what they do"
00:29:53,00:29:55,I always sell them as a tourist
00:29:55,00:29:58,And that's what they do they keep the temple going
00:29:58,00:30:05,That's so good. That's very good. Um the the world of Japanese temples and shrines is so interesting. It's amazing
00:30:05,00:30:07,It's so cool because there are so many thousands
00:30:07,00:30:10,A lot of them are amazingly old and this is I love this
00:30:10,00:30:17,The oldest continually operating company in the world is a temple building company called kongo gumi
00:30:17,00:30:20,When it was founded the prophet Muhammad was eight years old
00:30:20,00:30:24,It really is very old indeed and it was set up by a guy called Shigetsu kongo
00:30:24,00:30:28,And the firm kept going independently until 2006 and then it's become a
00:30:28,00:30:31,"subsidiary of another firm, but it is still going"
00:30:31,00:30:34,Don't sell yourself off after what 1500 years
00:30:34,00:30:40,"Big decision, but they still do it. They still specialize in construction and maintenance of buddhist temples"
00:30:40,00:30:45,"One good thing they have going is that some temples in japan, uh knock themselves down every 20 years"
00:30:46,00:30:51,"Do they yeah, well if you're if you're part of the building company. Oh, yeah"
00:30:51,00:30:57,so the idea is and this is um most famously a shrine in um
00:30:57,00:31:01,In tokyo that I've been to whose name I can't remember and I haven't written down
00:31:01,00:31:03,because I one of the main shrines in tokyo
00:31:03,00:31:09,And every 20 years they knock it down and they build a new one and the idea is
00:31:09,00:31:14,"One to sort of show renewal, which is obviously big in in these religions"
00:31:14,00:31:18,But also it keeps the artisan skills alive because if you're building
00:31:18,00:31:24,"Let's say you're building churches in the uk you might build a church, but then you might not need another one for 60 years"
00:31:24,00:31:27,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, or even 600 years"
00:31:27,00:31:31,"Yeah, and so who knows how to make an apps at that stage"
00:31:31,00:31:36,"So it's kind of planned obsolescence, which we need to use to hearing about with iPhones, but this is"
00:31:36,00:31:43,These are the iphones of japanese temples. That's the I think I know the name. Is it the chumbo wamba temple in
00:31:43,00:31:45,Because
00:31:45,00:31:48,It's something for the 90s children
00:31:48,00:31:50,No
00:31:50,00:31:55,"Yeah, I loved it andy. I loved it. But the entire process takes about 17 years"
00:31:55,00:32:01,So you you build it. It's there. You do three years of everything's fine
00:32:01,00:32:06,And then after three years you have to start planning for the next one. Oh come on. This is unionized bullshit
00:32:06,00:32:10,There's no way that's necessary
00:32:10,00:32:16,"There was this interesting um division slash marriage between shrines and temples in japan, which I didn't really know"
00:32:16,00:32:21,So there are 80 000 shinto shrines and about 77 000 buddhist temples
00:32:21,00:32:27,And you'll be going to see one or the other. They often look really similar and um often they used to be the same
00:32:27,00:32:34,It's kind of sad because japanese people believed in shintoism and then um buddhism came along about the sixth century
00:32:34,00:32:41,And they sort of merged quite happily until the 19th century and you'd have shrine temples and temple shrines
00:32:41,00:32:44,And you'd have like buddhas inside shinto shrines
00:32:44,00:32:48,"And then in the 19th century the meiji restoration said no, let's split them up"
00:32:48,00:32:52,And let's make sure the um buddhas know that they're secondary to shintoism
00:32:52,00:32:56,"And now they're divided, but you do get some buddhas hidden in"
00:32:56,00:33:03,Shrine still. Yes some sneaky buddhas. I don't believe that 40 000 temples in japan were destroyed during the meiji restaurant
00:33:04,00:33:11,Because that's imperial rule was restored and that basically the buddhist religion had been quite closely associated with the previous dynasty
00:33:11,00:33:15,And there were all sorts of rules like you had to affiliate yourself with the buddhist temple under the previous rules
00:33:15,00:33:20,And that was partly to prove you weren't christian and you had to do that just to lead a normal life
00:33:20,00:33:23,Basically it was kind of a condition of citizenship. So I think a lot of
00:33:23,00:33:29,Frustration had built up around that which is why when the meiji restoration happened all of these tens tens of thousands of
00:33:29,00:33:31,That's like half half the temples
00:33:31,00:33:37,"Obviously a very big country, but it's just the number of temples that it's just staggering. I think I went to a moss one"
00:33:37,00:33:40,"Did you? Yeah, I think it was in Kyoto. I can't really remember"
00:33:40,00:33:44,But I think you go over there and there's like a bucket of water
00:33:44,00:33:48,And you have a spoon and you pour the water over the buddha or whatever it is
00:33:48,00:33:53,And then it helps the moss to grow and it's really nice. I think you like say a wish and it comes true
00:33:53,00:33:55,My wish was already country
00:33:55,00:33:59,There's another one that helps you cure your warts
00:34:00,00:34:06,And the idea there is you put a coin in an offering box and you pick up a handful of salt and rub it in whichever area
00:34:06,00:34:09,"Has warts in it. Oh, and why didn't it work for you, James?"
00:34:09,00:34:16,And there's another one I really like that I've never been to but it's a single word shrine
00:34:16,00:34:19,And what you do is you put your coin in the box you clap your hands twice
00:34:19,00:34:22,And then your wish has to be a single word
00:34:22,00:34:27,So you can't say I wish to win 100 quid in the lottery
00:34:28,00:34:33,"You have to just say one word and if your wish doesn't edit down to one word, you can't have it"
00:34:33,00:34:35,"That's quite good, Stammer"
00:34:35,00:34:42,That and it's not so that um whatever god it is who's in control has a bit of leeway
00:34:42,00:34:46,So you could say cat and if the god wanted they could send a tiger to maul you to death
00:34:46,00:34:48,"Oh, yeah, that would have been good"
00:34:48,00:34:50,Like a monkey's paw
00:34:50,00:34:51,"Exactly, yeah"
00:34:51,00:34:55,"One of the good things is uh, if something traumatic happens in a westerners life"
00:34:55,00:35:02,"They often go to try and find themselves and there's an example. Um, which is uh, slightly topical, which is garrus southgate"
00:35:02,00:35:10,"So garrus southgate, uh, right after england football manager. England football manager. So the euros are currently on. Sorry. Yeah, sorry"
00:35:10,00:35:16,So back in the 90s. He famously botched a penalty kick and it was huge news
00:35:16,00:35:20,"Even though that that was yeah, when I got to the point where even his mother said to him, I quote"
00:35:20,00:35:22,Why didn't you blast it dear?
00:35:22,00:35:24,I need to get out of here
00:35:24,00:35:29,"So he went to barley and uh, he thought I'm just going to get some rest"
00:35:29,00:35:35,And so they stayed in this beautiful place where they were completely isolated and they found a stunning buddhist temple
00:35:35,00:35:40,There were lakes and volcanoes nearby. He said it was absolutely magical and then he said in the distance
00:35:40,00:35:42,He saw a monk associated with the temple
00:35:42,00:35:47,"Walk over to him. Yeah, and he comes up to him and the monk says"
00:35:47,00:35:50,You're garrus southgate. Oh mate that penalty
00:35:52,00:35:55,"I'm paraphrasing though, but those are the those are the words he basically said"
00:35:55,00:35:57,buddha did not like that
00:35:57,00:36:00,buddha would have blasted that
00:36:00,00:36:06,That's amazing. That's so funny. Sounds like she was advising the space program temple as well
00:36:06,00:36:16,"Have you heard of the shrine you go where you want to break up with someone? This is great. Oh, no, I haven't heard of that"
00:36:16,00:36:18,Sounds like quite a roundabout way of doing it
00:36:19,00:36:23,"You're in the car on the way and I know nothing about this. I'll quickly google it. No, no, no. Wait till we get there"
00:36:23,00:36:27,"Basically, there's a whole there's a whole sort of subspecies of shrines"
00:36:27,00:36:30,I think they're called engiri shrines and they the the local gods
00:36:30,00:36:34,They give you the strength to cut ties between you and another of whatever kind so it might be a relationship
00:36:34,00:36:36,might be a work thing might be anything
00:36:36,00:36:38,um
00:36:38,00:36:42,And there's one for example Manto kuchi temple in gunma prefecture
00:36:42,00:36:45,Which is where women could escape their abusive husbands
00:36:45,00:36:49,So it was quite an unusual kind of shrine because they're quite male environments
00:36:49,00:36:55,But this was a place where women could divorce their husbands and these days if you go there you can get a set of papers
00:36:55,00:36:56,They're either red or black
00:36:56,00:37:00,And you feel like one is I want a new relationship be formed and one is I want to break an old relationship
00:37:00,00:37:04,You know how I was saying i'm the about you buying a ballot box for you and your wife
00:37:04,00:37:06,"Oh, no"
00:37:06,00:37:12,I open it on the the morning this episode is released dozens of japanese characters. I can't read
00:37:14,00:37:16,But all saying the same
00:37:16,00:37:18,same sad message
00:37:18,00:37:24,But so you fill in these papers right you go into this special prayer area which contains two japanese squat toilets
00:37:24,00:37:29,And you put your paper so it floats on the water for a few seconds
00:37:29,00:37:32,So it's not it's not also used as a squat toilet right do not use the toilet
00:37:32,00:37:40,"And then you flush your prayers and that is the way that it gets carried away. Yeah, that's that's a very unusual variety of"
00:37:41,00:37:46,"Try but it shows you the range they've got. Yeah, they've got a huge problem in japan, haven't they their rivers are just full of"
00:37:46,00:37:48,prayers
00:37:48,00:37:52,"Very dangerous as women. Um, I don't know. We've never talked about the oldest temple in the world"
00:37:52,00:37:55,This is gobekli tepe in turkey
00:37:55,00:38:01,Which is quite recently confirmed to be the oldest in the world and it has um
00:38:01,00:38:06,A headless torso with an erect penis as part of its deco
00:38:07,00:38:13,It's these 60 massive pillars like limestone pillars that have all these engravings on them and they were
00:38:13,00:38:18,Built 11 000 years ago and then deliberately all buried a couple of thousand years later
00:38:18,00:38:24,"And yeah, they've got these amazing carvings on them and a lot of them are penis based obviously because the earliest temples"
00:38:24,00:38:30,They were obviously worshipping penises and so they feature they also feature eyeless ducks in their sculptures
00:38:30,00:38:33,Which quite scary and also you've missed the penis
00:38:36,00:38:38,That's the one-eyed duck
00:38:38,00:38:43,But in the land of the eyeless ducks the one-eyed duck is king
00:38:43,00:38:53,"Sure, um, they also have scum carvings of boars foxes and a headless man with erections"
00:38:53,00:38:58,Which the german and english text accompanying it mentioned and the turkish text does not wow
00:38:58,00:39:02,"Yeah, but interestingly they think this temple is why we invented agriculture"
00:39:02,00:39:08,So it's unclear why this was built at a time when we were hunter-gatherers and moving around a lot
00:39:08,00:39:11,It was built before we'd settled agriculturally
00:39:11,00:39:16,And it would have taken an enormous workforce and they would have stuck around for ages and ages to build it
00:39:16,00:39:21,And they think it might be that to build this temple. They had to be like we need we need a permanent food source
00:39:21,00:39:25,We need to get houses for all these people so that they can stick around and build it
00:39:25,00:39:28,And that was what led to the first agriculture
00:39:28,00:39:32,So it wasn't that we invented temples once we came up with farming in sat in one place
00:39:32,00:39:36,We invented farming because of this temple right that is really cool
00:39:36,00:39:41,I was told one theory that the reason they buried it is because they knew that on orami was coming to take over
00:39:41,00:39:46,"So they just all buried it and then when they arrived they just went, you know, nothing to see here"
00:39:46,00:39:52,"Wasn't there online map? It says there's a big city here. I think it's that yeah, it's that way"
00:39:53,00:39:58,Just go over this big mound. It's a little one-eyed duck sticking up here. Is that not something?
00:39:58,00:40:03,Do you know we've never talked about someone who must be one of Dan's favorite characters?
00:40:03,00:40:09,"Um, just speaking of weird space programs the Zambian space program. Oh, right. Yeah. No, we haven't. Um, no"
00:40:09,00:40:14,"We haven't and I love this guy. So 1964, um, obviously Maricala's base program"
00:40:14,00:40:19,Russia's space program USSR and Zambia had one and it was headed up by
00:40:20,00:40:26,Edward Makuka and Coloso who was a science teacher and he was director of the national academy of science based research and philosophy
00:40:26,00:40:28,unofficial
00:40:28,00:40:34,"Um, and he decided that they would be the first country to reach the moon. And yeah, they um, they actually never made it to the moon in the end"
00:40:34,00:40:37,"Yeah, I know it's weird, but they got really close"
00:40:37,00:40:45,"Yeah, no they didn't he asked for a lot of billions of dollars of funding for various countries, but his methods were so fun"
00:40:46,00:40:50,He so he recruited 12 afro-naughts and he did this whole
00:40:50,00:40:54,He made up that name and he invented this training regimen
00:40:54,00:40:58,"Which included um, he'd shut them in an oil drum"
00:40:58,00:41:03,And then he'd spin them around trees and roll them down hills in it so they could get used to um being weightless
00:41:03,00:41:08,Being bullied they get used to being bullied which might happen if you're on a long space journey. Yeah
00:41:08,00:41:11,"Well, if I'm on one"
00:41:11,00:41:14,You arrive at the moon with no lunch money
00:41:15,00:41:17,No days now
00:41:17,00:41:21,"No, no, don't flush my head down the toilet. It's literally a vacuum into space"
00:41:21,00:41:36,"Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show and that is Anna my fact this week is that cats only come in two colors"
00:41:36,00:41:40,Pink and brown
00:41:40,00:41:44,Well close
00:41:44,00:41:49,It's just it's just not true this isn't it? It's just it's not even I've seen cats that we've all seen cats
00:41:49,00:41:53,This is explained best I found by the cat fancies association
00:41:53,00:41:55,Who has a very an excellent
00:41:55,00:41:57,I would think so
00:41:57,00:41:59,I'm not surprised if not dogs are us
00:41:59,00:42:06,They are an excellent um sort of paper on this and basically explain that um
00:42:06,00:42:13,All cats have two colors black or red and all the colors you think you're seeing on cats are just kind of degrees of black and red
00:42:14,00:42:15,My cat is blue
00:42:15,00:42:18,Thank you for raising blue at this early stage james
00:42:18,00:42:24,So um black and red are expressed by the b gene which stands for brown in fact because black is just very dark brown
00:42:24,00:42:26,and the o gene
00:42:26,00:42:28,Which is orange
00:42:28,00:42:33,"We're learning so much about colors in this episode, aren't we? They're just not what you saw. I haven't learned anything weirdly"
00:42:33,00:42:35,It's too
00:42:35,00:42:36,complicated
00:42:36,00:42:40,Your blue cat as you say is just dark brown which doesn't exist by the way
00:42:40,00:42:46,"There's nothing as brown, but if it gets really dark, it's black. I'm just I'm not saying black itself as a color is dark brown"
00:42:46,00:42:48,I'm saying the black you see on cats is actually dark brown
00:42:48,00:42:53,"Okay, and actually often if you have a black cat it goes browner james your blue cat is just a dilute of black"
00:42:53,00:42:59,Hmm. What does that mean? It means it's got the black slash brown gene
00:42:59,00:43:04,But then on top of that it's got the dilution gene and that turns black into blue
00:43:04,00:43:06,But it's still black. It's just added some water
00:43:06,00:43:12,My cat is perfect and I don't like you saying her genes are diluted diluted cat. Sorry mate. What are we doing with white?
00:43:12,00:43:14,"Is that just the blank canvas you get? Oh my god, Dan"
00:43:14,00:43:19,You phrase the most difficult question right at the top as the cat fancies admit
00:43:19,00:43:24,White is the biggest problem the thing to know about white and you're not going to like this guys
00:43:24,00:43:29,"But this is according to cat fancies white is not a color. Okay. Oh, I buy that"
00:43:29,00:43:34,"It's a shade. I would say yeah, black and white aren't really colors. Black is a color though in this instance"
00:43:34,00:43:37,"Yeah, that's that's what's very brown. This is dark brown"
00:43:37,00:43:42,But the thing with white is the um your white cat is actually either brown or orange
00:43:42,00:43:46,So your white cat has genes for either being a black cat or an orange cat
00:43:46,00:43:49,But then it also has a kit gene quite nicely named
00:43:49,00:43:54,Which covers up those and often you can see the true color of the cat on its head
00:43:54,00:43:57,So if you've got a white cat with a tiny bit of orange on its head
00:43:57,00:44:02,It's actually an orange cat and if it mates with another cat then they'll likely be orange
00:44:02,00:44:06,I think I follow that because I I was reading that orange cats are likely to be male
00:44:06,00:44:09,"Yeah, almost always. Okay, and that's because"
00:44:09,00:44:14,The genetic information of the cat's color is found on the x chromosome
00:44:14,00:44:18,"Yeah, and females have two x's like in humans and males have an x and a y like in humans"
00:44:18,00:44:23,"So if the male's single x chromosome is orange, that's just an orange cat"
00:44:23,00:44:27,"Yeah, and a male can never have both black and orange"
00:44:27,00:44:31,"That's true. Exactly. So if you have a tortoise shell cat, which is like orange and black and white and stuff"
00:44:31,00:44:36,It has to be female because it's got two x's and one x can be black and one can be orange
00:44:36,00:44:41,"Except there are very few males that have an extra x chromosome, which is really rare. They're x x y"
00:44:41,00:44:46,That's really rare. So they can be tortoise shell huge if you've got one of those
00:44:46,00:44:52,That's but that's a real it's really rare and the other type you can have male tortoise shells is if it's a chimera
00:44:52,00:44:54,So you start off with an egg and a sperm
00:44:54,00:45:01,But then another egg and sperm come in and then you've got two embryos and they fuse together to make one cat
00:45:02,00:45:09,Okay chimeras and then like you get some chimeras where you get a cat and half of it is one color and half
00:45:09,00:45:12,It's the other color and it's exactly halfway down the body. Are you kidding? Really?
00:45:12,00:45:17,That's a great thing for a murder mystery plotline. Like the cat that was coming into the room
00:45:17,00:45:21,What color was it? Two people give different answers and that affects who the killer is
00:45:21,00:45:25,It's also really good for those panto skits where you play the man and the woman
00:45:28,00:45:30,That push and boots is going to be electric
00:45:30,00:45:36,It's so weird this stuff. It's fascinating. It is quite fascinating. One can go a bit too deep
00:45:36,00:45:40,I actually found this fact reading an article about a new cat color that has been discovered
00:45:40,00:45:45,"So there could be a claim that there's a third color. Oh, yeah, and that is salty licorice"
00:45:45,00:45:47,And this has just been discovered
00:45:47,00:45:52,It's a white chest and paws and then it's got black body with like white speckles on it
00:45:52,00:45:56,And they're missing a chunk of DNA. So that's genetically totally different to anything we've seen before
00:45:57,00:45:59,It sounds black in color
00:45:59,00:46:02,"No, it's not it's like salty licorice"
00:46:02,00:46:06,"It's like it's like someone with black hair that's going sort of patchy gray, right?"
00:46:06,00:46:11,That's it interesting and their hair starts out black and then it fades to white by the time it gets to the end of the hair
00:46:11,00:46:14,So it's kind of that strange and I can't believe having done this podcast for 10 years
00:46:14,00:46:19,You think oh everything's been discovered and then they found a new color of cat in the last year
00:46:19,00:46:24,"Do you know the word licorice? Yeah, it means this food this delicious food. Yeah"
00:46:24,00:46:29,But it also had two old meanings. It meant lecherous or someone who enjoys liquor
00:46:29,00:46:35,"So if you were licorice, it meant you really like drinking alcohol because you like drinking licorice"
00:46:35,00:46:39,And then it also meant lecherous because you might lick things
00:46:39,00:46:45,It's actually true. It's not related to the word lecherous. This is like an old 18th century meaning
00:46:45,00:46:49,It was like someone that licked a lot of things was lecherous and therefore they were licorice
00:46:49,00:46:52,Um cats
00:46:52,00:46:54,"Yeah, when they are"
00:46:54,00:46:55,growing
00:46:55,00:46:57,in the womb
00:46:57,00:47:00,This is cool about where they get the color from
00:47:00,00:47:06,"So the color cells all grow along their back. They're called neural crest cells. These are the color cells, okay?"
00:47:06,00:47:11,And they start building up and then they migrate around the body of the embryo
00:47:11,00:47:17,And they can get all the way around in which case you'll have a cat that's one color
00:47:17,00:47:22,"Oh, is that why you have white bellies? They can get only part of the way around well different patches of color"
00:47:22,00:47:27,"Basically, you'll have like white socks. Yeah, if they don't make it all the way around or a hitler moustache"
00:47:27,00:47:35,"And yeah, that's it and whether your cat is one color or different colors is completely dependent on how far those cells"
00:47:35,00:47:38,Migrate it around the body of the cat in embryo form
00:47:38,00:47:45,That's so interesting. So cool. Is it so often you see a white belly on a cat and it's just the belly is too far from the spine to
00:47:45,00:47:50,"Have yeah, basically all the way around. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's bizarre. And those socks are weird as well"
00:47:50,00:47:54,"Does your cat doesn't have socks? No, she's a perfect all one color. Okay"
00:47:54,00:47:59,Your breed as foe of the podcast that old Hitler would approve
00:47:59,00:48:05,"So the cats with socks, you know the white little white socks that you get they're lovely"
00:48:05,00:48:08,But they are because we domesticated cats
00:48:08,00:48:12,Because pre-domestication that would have been a terrible idea for a cat to have because they're hunting
00:48:12,00:48:16,"And if you see a big white sock clumping towards you, obviously you spot the cat"
00:48:16,00:48:22,So but early humans probably would have bred for that. There's a nice feature to have a breed of cat with socks like them
00:48:22,00:48:29,"Yeah, that's very cool. Um, your cats are all the same, right? As in not your cat james, which is what special and perfect"
00:48:29,00:48:34,But but you know what I mean like most cats look more like other cats than dogs look like other dogs
00:48:34,00:48:37,I see so you don't get like little sausage cats
00:48:37,00:48:42,Or great big cats or like bully excel cats. It just doesn't happen
00:48:42,00:48:47,And that's really interesting because there's no actual reason why
00:48:47,00:48:50,"We couldn't have done that, right?"
00:48:50,00:48:55,So and the reason is how long have we been breeding dogs for different purposes centuries?
00:48:55,00:49:01,"Yeah millennia millennia. Yeah, and you breed a dog to hunt otters or like a dachshund to hunt badgers in their sets or to"
00:49:01,00:49:05,Whatever pick up um grouse that you've just shot or whatever
00:49:05,00:49:11,All these different things whereas cats have fulfilled basically the same function all that time which is vermin in the home
00:49:12,00:49:15,"And companionship, right? If we'd put our work in"
00:49:15,00:49:21,500 years ago as humans we could now have like you're lost in the alps and then there's a cat with a barrel of brandy around its neck
00:49:21,00:49:28,That comes and yeah saves you a terrifying cat guard when you hear the meow walking past a farm you tense up and freak out
00:49:28,00:49:33,All kind we could have had every single cat under the sun every single dog could have had his mirror cat
00:49:33,00:49:38,I think this is actually a kids book ready to grow it is
00:49:38,00:49:41,It absolutely is sausage cat would be I'd read that
00:49:42,00:49:46,To a child that's amazing. Is it happening though or people?
00:49:46,00:49:52,"Well, no, but like, you know, why not why why haven't we started doing it people do breed amazing like yeah"
00:49:52,00:49:58,"Yes, like James is amazing British short-haired cats. There are breeds. Yeah, but they're not being bred to turn spits"
00:49:58,00:50:02,"They're all basically being bred because we like the look of them really. Yes. Yeah, I think"
00:50:02,00:50:07,Or some of them like the British shorthairs wear bred for hunting prowess
00:50:08,00:50:12,You're well my cat is the most useless cat in history
00:50:12,00:50:17,But like her breed was bred for chasing birds and stuff like that
00:50:17,00:50:19,It still does seem to me
00:50:19,00:50:22,Not the number sceptical about this claim because I'm not this explanation
00:50:22,00:50:27,But that cats still seem to have less variety than you'd expect from lots of breeding
00:50:27,00:50:31,"In in terms of size for instance, if we have bred some for hunting"
00:50:31,00:50:36,"Um, it's very interesting that you can get tiny tiny chihuahuas and giants and burners"
00:50:36,00:50:42,"And with cats, there's not much variety. If we'd wanted to could we have taken an ordinary domestic cat and bred it into the size of a lion"
00:50:42,00:50:46,"Could we have reinvented a cycle? Yes, but I think the other thing is that domestic cats"
00:50:46,00:50:52,Are hunters all of them pretty much. And so if you do breed a massive cat
00:50:52,00:50:56,"It's not going to be a lap cat. It's gonna like it's going to go after you, isn't it?"
00:50:56,00:50:59,"Well, the owner is behind it saying he's very friendly"
00:50:59,00:51:02,This is not the cat he is actually
00:51:04,00:51:09,"The hairless cat that was a kind of oh, yeah, that was a useful thing. They were trying to invent"
00:51:09,00:51:12,Well for people who wanted cats who were allergic to cat hair
00:51:12,00:51:14,"That was a big idea, but you can't once you've taken off all the hair"
00:51:14,00:51:18,I would argue it's no longer really the same kind of experience of cat ownership
00:51:18,00:51:22,You've always wanted a cat and you were so sad you couldn't have one
00:51:22,00:51:24,Gollum calls into the room
00:51:24,00:51:29,"Well, like that's Sphinx cats. They look like Gollum really. Yeah, they do. They don't look good"
00:51:29,00:51:33,But it was a slightly pointless exercise as well because it's not just the hair that people are allergic to
00:51:33,00:51:38,"There's stuff in their saliva, which is yeah, so at the time it was believed the hair was a simple thing"
00:51:38,00:51:42,But now there's just this naked cat that's still and they haven't they didn't breathe the dry mouth. No
00:51:42,00:51:48,"You know, I Sphinx cats are from I'll jump on it Egypt"
00:51:48,00:51:52,"I did read actually, but yeah Toronto Toronto"
00:51:52,00:51:59,It was three weird number of hairless kittens were found in Toronto in the 70s
00:51:59,00:52:02,And they bred them and bred them and so now they're all hairless
00:52:02,00:52:03,Nice
00:52:03,00:52:05,I was on um
00:52:05,00:52:08,"I think I'm a scientific american. Yeah, I was on scientific american"
00:52:08,00:52:13,I came across a headline which was what is the difference between hair and fur
00:52:13,00:52:19,We spoke with memalogist Nancy Simmons of the american museum of natural history about this. Here's the transcript
00:52:19,00:52:21,Is this gettable?
00:52:21,00:52:22,Yes
00:52:22,00:52:25,"Okay, fur on animals hair on humans. No hair on monkeys. I guess"
00:52:25,00:52:28,"Is there a fur on monkeys? I'd say. Oh, yeah"
00:52:28,00:52:31,If you comb it it's hair if you brush it it's fur
00:52:31,00:52:34,"Right. No, you brush you brush your head. Sorry. No, no, no, no"
00:52:34,00:52:42,Is it structured different as in no more keratin hair grows only on your head fur grows
00:52:42,00:52:45,your chest
00:52:45,00:52:52,I'm gonna put you out of your misery
00:52:52,00:52:59,Scientific american asks is there a difference between hair and fur? Nancy Simmons replies. There isn't hair and fur are the same thing
00:53:00,00:53:05,"I know disappointing. Okay. Here's the craziest thing I found researching this. Okay, you can give dog blood to a cat"
00:53:05,00:53:13,To eat or to to not to drink to infuse to if a cat needs a blood transplant
00:53:13,00:53:15,It can take dog blood
00:53:15,00:53:20,"I find that very difficult to believe. Hashtag more in common. Um, but only once"
00:53:20,00:53:24,Because they die
00:53:24,00:53:27,"You can drink a pint of arsenic, but only once"
00:53:28,00:53:34,"They don't die the first time you do it, but they will die the second. This is insane. So there are dog blood banks, but they do have nine lives"
00:53:34,00:53:38,"There are dog blood banks, which is great for dogs"
00:53:38,00:53:42,But there are very few for cats because for a cat to give blood takes a lot of the cat's blood
00:53:42,00:53:44,"And it's just a very it's harder to do, right?"
00:53:44,00:53:47,But if your cat needs a blood transfusion it can take some dog blood
00:53:47,00:53:51,But then it develops antibodies to the dog blood after the first time it gets some
00:53:51,00:53:56,So the second time you give it a transfusion it will it may react very badly and could die
00:53:56,00:54:02,"But basically there will be cats walking around right now, which are half dog and dogs if you're listening"
00:54:02,00:54:06,"Please donate today. Yeah, you know, you could be saving a cat's life"
00:54:06,00:54:09,"That's not the way to advertise it to dogs, actually"
00:54:09,00:54:14,"Um, I love that we have classical sort of dog people and cat people right"
00:54:14,00:54:20,My favorite example of it is that the fact that that made it in to the webster's dictionary the original in 1928
00:54:20,00:54:25,"So yeah, webster, he did an he did an initial dictionary, which was in 1806"
00:54:25,00:54:30,"And in it he used the exact same phrase to describe a dog in a cat, which is just a domestic animal"
00:54:30,00:54:36,"However, when he published his dictionary in 1828 he defined a dog as a species of quadrupeds belonging to the genus canis"
00:54:36,00:54:41,And many varieties as the mastiff the hound the spaniel the shepherd's dog the terrier the harrier
00:54:41,00:54:44,Keeps going on with cats
00:54:44,00:54:49,He describes the cat as it is a deceitful animal and when enraged extremely spiteful
00:54:50,00:54:52,That's it
00:54:52,00:54:58,Really thought in did you guys think he meant in the dictionary he was going to have cat person and dog person?
00:54:58,00:55:02,"Webster was a dog person. Yeah, he clearly was"
00:55:02,00:55:06,That's brilliant
00:55:06,00:55:08,James cat cat person clearly
00:55:08,00:55:15,"Actually really a neither person I think but I've had a cat forced upon me. Okay. Oh, okay. You're a people person"
00:55:15,00:55:17,I wouldn't say that
00:55:19,00:55:23,"I'm uh, you're barely you're barely a person. I'm a bacterial phage person"
00:55:23,00:55:26,"Yes, finally"
00:55:26,00:55:28,Someone will stick up for those guys
00:55:28,00:55:36,"Okay, that's it that is all of our facts"
