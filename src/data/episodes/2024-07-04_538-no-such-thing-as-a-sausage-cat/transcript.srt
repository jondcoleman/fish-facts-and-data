00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,340
 Hi everybody just before we start this week's show

2
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:07,000
 We have a very exciting announcement to make which is that we are going on tour later this year

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,440
 That's right. No such thing as a fish presents thunder nerds

4
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:13,080
 We are back on the road and if you want to come see us live

 Then we're gonna be in Glasgow Newcastle Cardiff London Manchester. That is all happening throughout September and October this year

9
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:34,160
 Yes

10
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:39,500
 And if you want to get tickets to a brand new live recording of the show which by the way

11
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:44,480
 We should say includes lots of actually very funny bits. We don't put into the panel show better in many ways

12
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:48,480
 You just need to go to no such thing as a fish dot com slash live

13
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:52,360
 All the tickets are available there some of them have sold out already some of them

14
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:58,720
 There are some tickets left for so go go go hurry now. All right, that's it on with the show open the podcast

15
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:21,360
 Hello and welcome to another episode of no such thing as a fish a weekly podcast coming to you from the QI officers in Hoburn

16
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:26,880
 My name is Dan Schreiber. I am sitting here with James Harkin and Anna Tushinsky and Andrew Hunter Murray

17
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:31,520
 But once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days

18
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:38,060
 And in no particular order here we go starting with fact number one and that is Andy

19
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:43,020
 My fact is that British elections couldn't go ahead without a device called the spanker

20
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:47,200
 Without it, we wouldn't have any conservative MPs

21
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:53,600
 Actually, we're recording this two weeks before the election and at the moment it looks like we might not have any

22
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:58,840
 Yes, so we don't know the result so really it could go either way

23
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:03,200
 I personally think they've got it in the bag, but whatever so this is not an election special also

24
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,320
 We should say that shouldn't we? Yes, it is a quarter of an election special

25
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:09,400
 Don't worry basically if you just tuned in the morning after the election thinking

26
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:12,700
 Oh, it's nice and just facts about what wasps or something this is only this bit

27
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:16,680
 But this is very exciting for you because you're listening to the only four people who don't know the result

28
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:21,800
 I can't believe they didn't know at that point that Donald Trump is going to become the prime minister

29
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,800
 How did that even happen?

30
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:29,140
 So I've been reading a lot about the election and this was a feature about literally the stuff that needs to make it happen

31
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:35,220
 You know that the the polling booths and the ballot boxes and all of that and it's about this company called Shaw and Sun

32
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:43,560
 Who have been making election equipment since 1750? Wow, I mean that's before even mass enfranchisement of the vote

33
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:46,600
 Wow, that's amazing. Ed, was it always like boxes and stuff?

34
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:52,440
 I'm not sure what the very earliest stuff was but these days they do about a hundred and sixty thousand little stuffy pencils per

35
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:56,940
 Election that's brilliant. I always thought they just got those from our goss. Well, they're like baby carrots

36
00:02:56,940 --> 00:03:01,940
 It's that you get a normal size pencil. You have to shave it down. It takes ages

37
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:04,940
 Oh, they're not specially bred. They're not a different species

38
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:13,180
 That's why this company is coining it in can I ask what a spanker is? Yes, it's a very very dull thing

39
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:18,680
 It's a long ruler with a hole in the end, right? And what you do is

40
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:24,160
 You stick that into the ballot box and you use it to mash down the votes

41
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:30,960
 So if your ballot box is already then you just give the old spanker a bit of a spanko and it just crams them down in a box

42
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:34,920
 Do we have the etymology? Why such a sexy name?

43
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:38,280
 I guess it's patting it down like you might

44
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:42,120
 Spanking as a force, isn't it? It's like a whack

45
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:48,380
 That's true. You know the word spanker originally meant just something great. Did it? Yeah, just that's a spanker

46
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:55,280
 Nice car went past. That's a spanker. I like that. Well, my my brand spanking new. Yes

47
00:03:55,280 --> 00:04:02,180
 Yeah, it was and it was a gold coin between 1663 and 1785 if you said that you had a spanker

48
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:06,220
 And then you had a gold coin in your pocket. Oh, is that a spanker in your pocket?

49
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:15,680
 One thing I didn't realize is now obviously this no one saw this election coming except maybe maybe a couple of people

50
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:19,760
 But we don't know if they've got premonition abilities

51
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:23,800
 We don't know what the mystical side of them is but no one knew this was coming

52
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:28,620
 And this is a nightmare for all of these companies that are running these elections because the UK is basically

53
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:30,800
 650 individual elections

54
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:36,460
 So everyone has to run around and make sure they have the stubby little pencils that they have the ballot boxes that they have

55
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:39,600
 Everything ready, but it's even physical venues, you know

56
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:45,340
 People are like having their weddings in certain places in halls that you suddenly are needed on this on this day

57
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:51,200
 You know, so the hecticness of the count is it's quite a thing in Britain and it's also a thing that is

58
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:57,360
 Not true of all countries, right? It's quite weird that we still have human beings counting through votes

59
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:02,860
 You know in America think almost everyone does some form of electronic voting in lots of other countries

60
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:06,500
 And we've mentioned before the most exciting

61
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:13,500
 Results that you guys listening will know and we don't which is who won out of Sunland and Newcastle in the race to see who declares

62
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:19,540
 The first constituency, but did you know there is a third, you know a reform equivalent coming up on the inside?

63
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:26,180
 Is there is it? Let's say it must be Hartley-Poole or Durham or it's got to be somewhere up there, hasn't it?

64
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:30,860
 It is somewhere up there. Well done James. Why do you say that? Well because the other two are up there

65
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:33,420
 It's

66
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:42,200
 Sort of because of that yeah, because it seems that it's the brainchild of one single man who did this and it's a guy called Bill Crawford and

67
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:45,580
 He was head of elections at Sunderland council in 1992

68
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:49,860
 He thought let's make Sunderland famous for always declaring first the vote

69
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:54,620
 So for internationalists they always take about an hour and a half to count all the votes and it's very exciting because they win

70
00:05:54,620 --> 00:06:01,340
 But anyway, we mentioned that Newcastle then won in 2017 and 2019, but that was because Bill Crawford had changed councils

71
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:05,500
 So he went to Newcastle and he masterminded their victory

72
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:11,060
 That's amazing and is Bill gone somewhere else now? He's gone somewhere else. Has he? He has gone to Ashington and Blythe

73
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:13,700
 Which I believe is one of the new constituencies

74
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:19,180
 After all the redrawing and it's in Northumberland. Yeah, they are and they've changed all of the

75
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:24,540
 Constituencies now haven't they yeah, the boundaries are not really interesting, but the reason they've done it is to try and make

76
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:29,940
 The number of people in each constituency more level. I think yeah, that's the idea

77
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:35,760
 So they want every constituency to have between sixty nine thousand and seventy seven thousand voters in it

78
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:40,700
 But what interesting thing about that is in the United States the Congress has

79
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:43,660
 435 members

80
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:51,340
 But there was an amendment in the Constitution that was going to say that every districts had to have a maximum of fifty thousand citizens

81
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:57,660
 Okay, they never put this amendment in okay, but if they had then the current US Congress would have to have at least

82
00:06:57,660 --> 00:07:00,500
 6,600 members

83
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:03,500
 Can I tell you about a candidate? This is I love this, okay?

84
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:06,380
 So, you know you get on your ballot paper

85
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:10,940
 Like there are some main parties then a few others depending on where in the country you are there might be some local ones

86
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:15,340
 Like the SMP or whatever and there might be a couple of independence as well. Yeah, and especially in the

87
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:21,380
 Sort of senior like the Prime Minister seat. There'll be sort of 12 candidates. Yeah, and there are like monster raving loony

88
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:25,260
 Yeah, exactly. Well, I just love this. Okay in the 1994

89
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:32,020
 This wasn't a biggie actually there's European elections. I was in Devon Richard Huggett stood for a party

90
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:37,420
 That he called the literal Democrats brilliant right as opposed to the liberal Democrats

91
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:42,220
 Thank you for making the comparison for us for international listeners who might not have heard of the Lib Dems

92
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:49,460
 Maybe they're huge in Chattanooga. I don't know but who's not heard of our new Prime Minister's party

93
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:59,060
 But the literal Democrats he got 10,000 votes because people just read oh, yeah, that must be that's they just misread it

94
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:01,380
 Oh, I think it's illegal to do that as well

95
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:06,900
 He was responsible. He's probably the only independent MP who's ever got a law changed because thanks to him

96
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:10,380
 The law was changed because the actual Lib Dems lost that seat by 700 votes

97
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:16,600
 Oh, wow, they would have won it were it not for the 10,000 to vote it for him. Wow, so he got so they claim

98
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:20,980
 So you now cannot do that that's crazy

99
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:27,540
 So someone was saying that if Queen Victoria sort of time traveled to today and went to a polling booth

100
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:34,620
 It wouldn't look alien to her it would look exactly like how she would have remembered it because 80% of all of the principles

101
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:37,300
 That was set out in the ballot act in 1872 are the same

102
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:40,860
 So you think those people outside doing selfies with the dogs that was the same

103
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:45,620
 So that would be that would be a bit confusing but once she's inside with a little pencil. She's like I'm home

104
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:48,260
 She's gonna say what are all these women doing here?

105
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:55,020
 So if you go to this website by the way shore and sons the company that did oh, yeah

106
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:58,860
 I'm lucky you can just buy this stuff. You can buy yourself a spanker if you like for 5.95

107
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:03,340
 You really which I think is probably cheaper than a lot of other shops might charge you for a spanker

108
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:09,100
 Yeah, but I mean you can get also you can get a basic kit you can buy a sign saying you may use your own pen

109
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:11,100
 What would you?

110
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:16,260
 It's only you and your wife in your house, isn't it? Yeah, why might you want a ballot box?

111
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:19,540
 Oh, what's for tea tonight?

112
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:23,180
 All sorts of things. I would love that in fact I might buy it

113
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:27,820
 Yeah, there are two weeks to go to the election. So I might actually buy some stuff for the house like you know abuse

114
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:29,820
 That's another sign you could buy. I'd love to buy one of those

115
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:37,020
 Do you remember I absolutely walked into a primary school during the Brexit referendum

116
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:41,020
 I was going to vote

117
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:47,780
 And they were singing in out

118
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:54,480
 That's the problem I was looking for where I needed to go and vote and I knew it was on this road

119
00:09:54,480 --> 00:10:00,780
 But I didn't see where and there was a sign that said out and then there was another sign that said in a bit further down

120
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:04,040
 And I was like, okay, here we go. So I went inside and they went. What are you doing here?

121
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:08,280
 And I was like, I'm just here to vote and they said this is a school and I said, I'm sorry the signs outside

122
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:13,260
 They said that's for cars. That's the car park. That's an in sign and an outside

123
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:16,220
 So you don't drive in the wrong spot tragedy your vote to shake it all about

124
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:19,220
 Declan invalid

125
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:27,780
 Funny it was embarrassing and Sean Kemp who was the head of press for lit Dems in 2010

126
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:35,700
 Said that for party leaders dignity has to be less important than coverage sometimes

127
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:39,420
 Lessons have been taken on by the current

128
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:45,100
 Because for people outside the UK the main part of this campaign for me

129
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:51,340
 Is that when you look at the news? It's like labor talk about the latest tax or the

130
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:58,260
 Conservatives say how they're gonna stop migration and then it's a Davey the leader of the Lib Dems goes bungee jumping with mr.

131
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:00,260
 Blobby

132
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:04,220
 But this has been the technique for at least 15 years

133
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:10,340
 Yeah, so Nick Clegg went to go ape and did a lip-sync with Kylie rage absence. I really like you

134
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:16,380
 Don't remember that but the main king of it was the head of the Scottish Lib Dems called Willie Rennie

135
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:20,980
 Once he was in a farm and he was talking about some I don't know

136
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:26,740
 Wind farms or something and he wasn't really sure why he was there and he said I don't know how but it certainly does

137
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:31,260
 Help in some way someone somewhere will work it out and work out why we're here

138
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:35,900
 He was said this in an interview, but while he was saying it there were two pigs having sex behind it

139
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:45,260
 It's the most amazing video you've ever seen and it became so notorious that the courier evening telegraph even reported when the pigs died a

140
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:47,420
 Few years later because they became so famous

141
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:49,980
 and the idea is that

142
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:56,540
 They think that the the press who kind of go around with all these politics are always really grumpy and they always think they're in

143
00:11:56,540 --> 00:12:00,960
 The wrong place because who cares what the Lib Dems say they want to be where the action is happening

144
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:04,580
 And so they have to put on all these things to kind of keep the press happy

145
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:11,500
 So I'm super fun. Yeah, I mean his tour bus is like champagne is given out and party poppers and then you know

146
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:14,340
 They all get to go down waterslides naked with not naked

147
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:20,300
 Trunks with him for me. Yeah, Davey has been an advert for how great Britain can be

148
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:24,780
 He's just done all the most fun stuff in Britain. He's secretly working for the British tourist board

149
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:30,860
 I went on to so like you went on to the website to buy all of that paraphernalia

150
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:37,260
 Yeah, the smaker and so on I went on to the major political party websites to look at their stores to see if there's any fun stuff

151
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:39,780
 That you can get as well much. Yeah, they're merch stores

152
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:45,400
 And they do have a few things that they're trying to have a sense of humor with so for example on the conservative site

153
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:49,360
 You can buy a pair of Cure Starmer flip-flops, so you've got his face on them

154
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:55,260
 You will see flip flip between policies all the time. Can you also buy a massive bin fire from there?

155
00:12:56,940 --> 00:13:01,980
 Well, what's interesting is it's only made me realize that it's a very different culture here in Britain too

156
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:07,240
 it is in the States where you have so much merch that comes out during an election and

157
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:12,740
 They they print so much with the hope of the expectation the person's gonna get in and continue to sell

158
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:16,340
 But what happens when they lose what happens when they have to drop out?

159
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:22,460
 What do you do with all this merch and apparently for years after the 2012 election in Kenya?

160
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:25,700
 You could see kids just walking around with Mitt Romney t-shirts and hats

161
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:33,100
 Thousands were sent over there. And so yeah, so they have to just redistribute all of these things that yeah, it's pretty extraordinary

162
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:36,540
 I was on custom condoms.co.uk. Oh, yeah

163
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:45,860
 You were also on there and the user is currently looking at this condom

164
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:50,780
 We've been bidding against each other for that one condom, haven't we?

165
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:54,900
 I won't go at any of our 59p

166
00:13:54,900 --> 00:14:02,700
 Selling condoms with political jokes on them. No, it's not practical jokes

167
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:15,980
 So they have like Rishi no Rashi. Oh, yeah to protect you from STDs

168
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:20,780
 We're Fakir or Ed Davey makes my legs go wavy

169
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:31,220
 Anyway, the really interesting thing about this is they also have a poll on the website about how many they've sold and

170
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:40,220
 At the time of research labor on 34.2 percent the Tories were on 19.4 percent reformer on 15.6 percent

171
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:42,420
 And the Lib Dems are on 10.3 percent

172
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:47,980
 Which is almost exactly as the actual polls are. It's insane

173
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:51,380
 The only difference is that the Green Party are on 14.1

174
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:56,620
 So if you give 7% of their vote to labor it is pretty much exactly as the same as the polls

175
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:57,620
 Wow

176
00:14:57,620 --> 00:15:03,300
 It's that amazing. A great graphic at the end would be if they actually put the condom onto three people's penises

177
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:05,300
 But they are the right height

178
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:12,380
 When gone erect, let's see who's won. That's the Channel 4 swingometer this year

179
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:23,620
 Okay, it is time for fact number two and that is James

180
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:31,300
 Okay, my fact this week is that the Never Pink movement refers to hunters in the US who refuse to wear pink clothing

181
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:36,740
 Even though it gives them more chance of shooting their prey and makes them less likely to be shot themselves

182
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:44,100
 So by not wearing pink they're less likely to catch anything and they're more likely to be shot by a fellow hunter exactly

183
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:49,300
 But their mates might take the piss out of them because they're wearing pink and that's why they refuse to do it

184
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:52,760
 Oh, actually, there's a few reasons that we might get to but is it a political thing

185
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:59,540
 Is it like pinko's the communist thing or is it just a girly color? I'm afraid it's more of like a homosexual

186
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:06,320
 I see girly thing although actually there are a group of women Never Pinkers

187
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:10,520
 And reason for a lot of them is they just get annoyed that you know

188
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:14,160
 Why should we wear pink just because we're women right because some of these pink things

189
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:18,320
 They try and sell them to women and they think well, we should wear the same as everyone

190
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:21,760
 So you might be mistaken also for a flamingo actually, so yes

191
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:28,240
 It's amazing that as part of the research that they cite why pink is better is that pink is

192
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:33,780
 Supposedly less visible to the animals that they're hunting. Yeah, it's deer specifically

193
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,040
 And it's compared to orange

194
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:43,520
 So most states in America say that you have to wear some kind of hives and they'll say it's either orange or pink

195
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:44,920
 Or it might be other things

196
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:50,440
 But basically the choice for these hunters is between orange and pink and they much more prefer to go for orange

197
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:55,520
 And this I should say came from an article in the Wall Street Journal by John Clark, which I read about this

198
00:16:55,520 --> 00:17:01,200
 Here's a cool thing about pink you can tell where a salmon is from by the hue of its flesh

199
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:05,560
 So we've mentioned before that salmon are pink because of the things they eat, right?

200
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:09,800
 And

201
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:15,520
 But the different species of salmon they all have different diets which are heavier or lighter in

202
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:18,260
 The krill of the shrimp that give them that hue

203
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:23,260
 So if you're an Alaskan sockeye salmon, you'll be a very deep red because you live near the Bering Sea

204
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:25,160
 Which is full of krill that's interesting

205
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:29,480
 But if you're a king salmon you eat relatively less of that stuff and you'll be much paler

206
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:33,140
 I think the problem is though that they just put colouring in salmon these days

207
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:39,400
 Don't they? No, they don't put colouring but they farm salmon and feed them deliberately pink stuff to make them more pink than they would

208
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:45,520
 Yes, they would be it would be a lot more gray and less appetizing looking to us. Yeah, pink's an amazing colour

209
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:52,160
 I've never really thought about pink too much, but as far as science knows at the moment, it's the oldest colour on earth

210
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:54,460
 Okay

211
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:57,740
 That's the oldest colour. Yes, it was in black and white at some point

212
00:17:57,740 --> 00:18:11,400
 Yeah, basically a few years back they crushed a 1.1 billion-year-old rock that they found beneath the Sahara Desert and

213
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:18,820
 That produced pink and that's the oldest colour that we now know of. Okay. Yeah, so cool

214
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:26,920
 Weirdly the oldest colour, but also get ready to be upset chemist, physicist, scientist. It's not a colour

215
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:34,460
 Well, I, people get annoyed when you say this, but it's not a colour. It's not on the spectrum, right?

216
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:38,860
 You look at the spectrum red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet, a rainbow

217
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:42,900
 Pink isn't in there and this does make it really special

218
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:46,900
 So the way our eyes merge other colours, right, as we see a specific wavelength

219
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:52,060
 So you'll see a specific wavelength for blue or a specific wavelength for red or for green

220
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:56,340
 And then if you're seeing two different colours, you'll see the average of those wavelengths

221
00:18:56,340 --> 00:19:02,660
 So if you see red and yellow, the average of those two wavelengths is orange. So you see that, but

222
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:04,900
 when we see pink

223
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:09,140
 It's actually because we're seeing the shortest wavelength and the longest wavelength

224
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:14,060
 So we're saying red at one end of the rainbow and then like a violet blue at the other end

225
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:18,100
 And if you've got the average of them, it would be like green in the middle of the rainbow

226
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:21,260
 Which doesn't really make any sense. So our brain invents a new colour

227
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:28,100
 So pink isn't on the spectrum. The way you can tell this, this is an exciting experiment you can do, which I find so cool

228
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:33,660
 Type in magenta circle or go on to Microsoft Word and draw yourself a magenta circle

229
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:36,060
 Stare at that circle for a minute

230
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:40,740
 And first of all, what you'll see is it goes green around the edge, which is super cool

231
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:44,500
 And then if you stare at it for a minute, if you look at the white space on the page next to it

232
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:49,140
 You'll see a green circle and that's because that's like the inverse of pink

233
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:51,140
 Like the negative kind of thing

234
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:54,580
 Right, and if you stare at it for a minute longer, it tells you who the zodiac kill it

235
00:19:54,580 --> 00:20:01,700
 But you're wearing a pink watch and you're trying to say basically that colour doesn't, it's brain fabricated

236
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:08,100
 Yeah, and others like brown is a little bit, but pink is the most obvious and most round the other side of the spectrum

237
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:12,660
 Yeah, brown's not on the spectrum either. No, I know and that's another example of an extra spectral colour

238
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:15,300
 It's just not quite as fun as pink. Maybe the spectrum is not as helpful

239
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:18,740
 Do you know what I mean? Yeah, I'm with you

240
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:24,820
 Maybe the spectrum is not a good way of thinking about it. That is just nature though. The spectrum is just the reality

241
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:28,980
 I guess I'm defining colour as something with a wavelength and pink doesn't have a wavelength

242
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:32,980
 Okay, I was reading about just the effect that pink can have on us

243
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:36,980
 there's this shade of pink called Baker Miller pink and

244
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:42,900
 It's been given a big claim that it's a pink that if you stare at or if you're surrounded by it calms you down

245
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:47,460
 So it was based on some old research which has not been replicated

246
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:51,780
 However, people kind of don't care in jails around the world like in switzerland

247
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:56,500
 They will paint this Baker Miller pink everywhere because they believe that if you're in its presence

248
00:20:56,500 --> 00:21:02,180
 It takes out all your aggression and it just absolutely winds you down and they also use it in sport

249
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:09,220
 So you have football teams like Norwich City Football Club who will paint the visiting teams locker room

250
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:13,140
 Entirely pink so that when they get in their aggression is taken out

251
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:16,340
 And they're not as feisty for the match and even though we don't even know if it's true

252
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:20,180
 It does affect the mentality of people so in america and american football

253
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:21,380
 They do this as well

254
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:28,580
 And you'll have the coaches coming in getting furious about one pink room and he'll like put white paper all over the walls

255
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:34,180
 So that is players don't get influenced by this calming color. It could definitely have an effect because let's say

256
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:39,300
 Well, first of all the away team might think oh, no, it's pink. I'm going to be less aggressive

257
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:43,140
 So they might just naturally think yeah, but also the home team might think

258
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:48,100
 We've given them the pink dressing room that will make us better and it would just make you, you know

259
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:53,300
 Psychologically play better. Yeah, psyops. It's all sort of what's it called psychosomatic. Yeah

260
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:57,300
 If you're the home team, it's good for you to know that and then you have to give the away team

261
00:21:57,300 --> 00:22:00,500
 Who are visiting you a pamphlet explaining? Yeah. Yeah, actually did you know that?

262
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:04,100
 And that's they leave the room you just quickly whisper to each one of them, you know, that's not even a color

263
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:08,020
 And it just psychologically

264
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:12,180
 You know that song that chelsea sing blue is the color they used to sing blue is a color

265
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:15,620
 Unlike pink of course

266
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:20,020
 And a lot of other teams use different things in their dressing rooms instead of this pink color

267
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:25,700
 So uh burnley fc used to turn the temperature up in the away dressing room to make everyone sweat

268
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:32,100
 They also make the away dressing room door smaller than normal making the players sort of hunch down as they

269
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:35,700
 That would have the opposite effect on me because I think gosh, I'm big and tall and mighty

270
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:39,460
 Like giving them all a half point. They think wow, I'm huge

271
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:43,140
 In arsenal according to legend

272
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:45,220
 They have a table in the middle of the dressing room

273
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:49,860
 Which is such a height that wherever the manager stood some of the people won't be able to see them. Oh, wow

274
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:56,580
 How tall is this table? So you're sat down like you're sat down on benches. Yeah

275
00:22:57,140 --> 00:23:02,660
 And it'll be like halfway up the room is this big sort of like of us like a kitchen counter

276
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:04,980
 That's great

277
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:11,140
 In liverpool, apparently they would polish the floor really an awful lot in the away dressing room

278
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:14,180
 So that um players would have to tip to around so they didn't slip

279
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:16,980
 And they put banana peel all over it

280
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:19,060
 One more of these. Oh, yeah

281
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:24,660
 Chelsea fc apparently made the mirrors in the away dressing room, you know like those holes of mirrors

282
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:28,340
 Make you really tall or really small or whatever

283
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:34,740
 They made them making it look like the away players were smaller than they are and the home players were bigger than they are

284
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:38,980
 I should say this was all according to an article in the sun about olly's

285
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:40,580
 Okay, right

286
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:43,780
 That's a great collection. Well, that's fun. Pink ladies

287
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:49,140
 Uh from greece. I'm actually thinking of the apples. Oh, pink lady apple

288
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:51,940
 But it's it's actually I believe several different kinds of apple

289
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:55,860
 Is it but they're grouped it's like how when you order scampi you're getting any old

290
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:58,980
 Stuff, you know, it's just got bachelor on it and it's from the sea basically

291
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:01,780
 I mean, there is a main one which is called krips pink

292
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:04,420
 Uh after

293
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:06,980
 Like how children say crisps. Uh, no

294
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:10,180
 It's after the gang the krip. No, it's not it's um

295
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:15,460
 John krips who was a sort of apollographer from uh apollologist

296
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:20,500
 Yeah, an apollographer story is someone who draws apples or writes the biographies of apples

297
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:25,300
 Well, this this guy was in a way doing that because he was breeding the apples

298
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:31,460
 It took him decades to get the pink lady perfect because they originated in australia because they need really high temperatures to grow and

299
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:33,460
 to become perfect

300
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:39,940
 And um, he died in 2022. He was nearly 100 years old. I think when he died get on in all those apples. Yeah, a couple of days exactly

301
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:44,660
 Yeah, I like a pink lady actually. I thought about you guys. I think it's my favorite apple. It's my favorite apple

302
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:50,580
 Yeah, I love it. It's objectively the best apple guys and I think it's just I mean, it's obviously rock hard

303
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:54,660
 It's nice and sour and I like to not like a pink lady

304
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:57,140
 I actually like a braven

305
00:24:57,140 --> 00:24:59,220
 Oh the lesser appreciated

306
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:04,100
 Despite having just said the pink lady is the best. Yeah, you like the one that is less in my heart of hearts

307
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:07,300
 I know pink lady is the best. It's also the most expensive and i'm very stingy

308
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:10,340
 So i'll save that 25p and go for the braven

309
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:15,220
 I objectively know that man's city are the best football team, but that doesn't stop me from supporting tremere rovers

310
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:17,460
 Exactly braven is my jam here

311
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:21,940
 Um, do you know we invented pink pigs?

312
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:28,180
 Did we? Yeah, okay. Yeah, what were they before? So they won. Yeah wild pigs aren't pink. Yeah, we're brown

313
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:30,180
 So we're from one non-color to another non-color

314
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:35,060
 Pigs don't exist. That's why they have no predators in the natural world. Nothing can see hardly

315
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:40,420
 No, we we bred them to be pink and we're not really sure why it's when humans started breeding animals for farming

316
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:43,060
 And we assume it's just because we like bright fun colors

317
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:48,820
 And they wouldn't survive in the wild as pink because they are quite visible and obviously pink is not a very good disguise color

318
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:53,460
 And they get sunburned as well, don't they and they do get sunburned exactly because pink means they've got no melanin

319
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:55,620
 That's wild. No

320
00:25:55,620 --> 00:26:01,860
 I was looking up pink slang as well. Oh, yeah from jonathan green's fantastic

321
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:08,100
 Dictionary of slang. Yeah, we've referred to a few times before. I think it's it's amazing pink cigar

322
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:18,260
 The penis oh is it pink oboe is this all gonna be the penis no playing the pink oboe does feel like masturbating

323
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:25,140
 That's his penis the pink pink panatella like a panatella cigar. Oh, is it the italian version of the pink pan?

324
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:27,300
 I'm afraid it's the penis

325
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:30,420
 Um pink torpedo. Yeah

326
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:32,500
 He's the next

327
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:37,460
 Pink finger next it's a skinhead actually a pink finger. Oh, yeah, okay. Yeah, right

328
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:40,420
 Unfortunately, it means skinhead but skinhead means penis

329
00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:46,500
 Um pink trumpet. I must be I mean they're all penis pink steel

330
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:50,180
 Pink steel. Yeah, penis. Um pink palace

331
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:53,380
 Uh, that's a vagina. It certainly is

332
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:57,460
 Pink what pinken the pinken the pinken pinken pinken that

333
00:26:57,460 --> 00:27:04,420
 That's that's no, that's the financial times needs faith. Oh, yeah, the pink one. Yeah, yeah, the pink one. So there you go

334
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:09,460
 So it's mostly it's mostly penis. Yeah, yeah, unless it's the financial times

335
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:11,460
 It's not the financial times in your pocket

336
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:23,140
 Okay, it is time for fact number three and that is my fact

337
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:30,020
 My fact this week is that monks working at the 2800 year old buddhist temple daigoji in japan

338
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:35,560
 Maintain a five-story pagoda a cherry blossom garden and a space program

339
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:41,380
 Space program. Yeah, is it up there with the u.s. And um,

340
00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:45,700
 China space programs. This is uh, it's it's a slow start

341
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:51,860
 They're going to be sending one small satellite up that measures 20 centimeters in length and 30 centimeters in width

342
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:54,100
 You weren't even very small monk on that. No

343
00:27:54,100 --> 00:28:01,060
 This is yeah, this is a this is a heritage place in in um kiyoto

344
00:28:01,060 --> 00:28:07,860
 And the monks there have become very interested in the idea of if you know, for example that a temple in space is flying

345
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:10,660
 Over you can track it and you can pray to that temple

346
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:14,180
 So it's it's a sort of even for wandering monks and so on

347
00:28:14,180 --> 00:28:20,340
 To be able to pray to whenever the iss goes over. Yeah, we always get a tiresome person like me going. Oh, look, that's

348
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:27,300
 A star that looks like it's moving. That's the iss actually. Yeah, but instead we'd be like now we all meditate

349
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:29,940
 Yeah, exactly. Now it's a meditation thing

350
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:33,940
 So they have teamed up with a satellite developer called terra space ink

351
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:37,460
 Who were also based in kiyoto and it was meant to go up in 2023

352
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:41,780
 It hasn't been launched yet, but it's still they're they're doing tons of talks about it and so on

353
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:45,620
 So it sounds like it's still on the cards, but yeah, that's their that's very cool

354
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:49,940
 That's their plan. Yeah, and it said that priests will give space services

355
00:28:49,940 --> 00:28:52,420
 I mean, is that just like doing something over zoom?

356
00:28:52,420 --> 00:28:56,420
 Is does that mean the priest in the temple on the ground a romantic way of looking at it?

357
00:28:56,420 --> 00:28:59,220
 I mean, yes, it's technically like doing something over zoom

358
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:06,020
 We're gonna already communicate with far flung temples all the south wise Elon musk has put up there

359
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:12,020
 I really like it. I think it's awesome. It's it is a bit confusing about how the operation is going to work at the moment

360
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:15,220
 Largely because the articles are just translated from a local source

361
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:18,340
 So it's we haven't got in depth on it yet as far as I know

362
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:21,540
 But inside the temple that it's going to be in space the satellite

363
00:29:21,540 --> 00:29:25,780
 They're going to include a buddhist statue and a mandala painting or a few of those

364
00:29:26,420 --> 00:29:31,860
 Mandala Mandala Mandala Mandala. No, no Nelson Mandala is uh, yeah, no a mandala painting

365
00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:37,460
 Yeah, that will be within this tiny little really. Yeah, which we should probably say what mandala painting is

366
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:42,100
 Yeah, it's like one of those geometric circles like a lot of different colors

367
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:45,220
 Yeah, it's like kind of but it's a circle, but it means something in buddhism

368
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:50,340
 It's a sort of holy symbol of eternity. Is it I'm going I have a few of them at home

369
00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:53,060
 Yeah, which I have absolutely no idea what they do

370
00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:55,620
 I always sell them as a tourist

371
00:29:55,620 --> 00:29:58,180
 And that's what they do they keep the temple going

372
00:29:58,180 --> 00:30:05,220
 That's so good. That's very good. Um the the world of Japanese temples and shrines is so interesting. It's amazing

373
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:07,540
 It's so cool because there are so many thousands

374
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:10,660
 A lot of them are amazingly old and this is I love this

375
00:30:10,660 --> 00:30:17,220
 The oldest continually operating company in the world is a temple building company called kongo gumi

376
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:20,180
 When it was founded the prophet Muhammad was eight years old

377
00:30:20,660 --> 00:30:24,420
 It really is very old indeed and it was set up by a guy called Shigetsu kongo

378
00:30:24,420 --> 00:30:28,740
 And the firm kept going independently until 2006 and then it's become a

379
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:31,460
 subsidiary of another firm, but it is still going

380
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:34,820
 Don't sell yourself off after what 1500 years

381
00:30:34,820 --> 00:30:40,420
 Big decision, but they still do it. They still specialize in construction and maintenance of buddhist temples

382
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:45,780
 One good thing they have going is that some temples in japan, uh knock themselves down every 20 years

383
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:51,140
 Do they yeah, well if you're if you're part of the building company. Oh, yeah

384
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:57,380
 so the idea is and this is um most famously a shrine in um

385
00:30:57,380 --> 00:31:01,140
 In tokyo that I've been to whose name I can't remember and I haven't written down

386
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:03,620
 because I one of the main shrines in tokyo

387
00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:09,220
 And every 20 years they knock it down and they build a new one and the idea is

388
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:14,180
 One to sort of show renewal, which is obviously big in in these religions

389
00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:18,580
 But also it keeps the artisan skills alive because if you're building

390
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:24,980
 Let's say you're building churches in the uk you might build a church, but then you might not need another one for 60 years

391
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:27,060
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, or even 600 years

392
00:31:27,060 --> 00:31:31,940
 Yeah, and so who knows how to make an apps at that stage

393
00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:36,180
 So it's kind of planned obsolescence, which we need to use to hearing about with iPhones, but this is

394
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:43,380
 These are the iphones of japanese temples. That's the I think I know the name. Is it the chumbo wamba temple in

395
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:45,540
 Because

396
00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:48,180
 It's something for the 90s children

397
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:50,900
 No

398
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:55,860
 Yeah, I loved it andy. I loved it. But the entire process takes about 17 years

399
00:31:55,860 --> 00:32:01,060
 So you you build it. It's there. You do three years of everything's fine

400
00:32:01,060 --> 00:32:06,500
 And then after three years you have to start planning for the next one. Oh come on. This is unionized bullshit

401
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:10,100
 There's no way that's necessary

402
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:16,900
 There was this interesting um division slash marriage between shrines and temples in japan, which I didn't really know

403
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:21,140
 So there are 80 000 shinto shrines and about 77 000 buddhist temples

404
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:27,700
 And you'll be going to see one or the other. They often look really similar and um often they used to be the same

405
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:34,500
 It's kind of sad because japanese people believed in shintoism and then um buddhism came along about the sixth century

406
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:41,140
 And they sort of merged quite happily until the 19th century and you'd have shrine temples and temple shrines

407
00:32:41,140 --> 00:32:44,580
 And you'd have like buddhas inside shinto shrines

408
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:48,500
 And then in the 19th century the meiji restoration said no, let's split them up

409
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:52,820
 And let's make sure the um buddhas know that they're secondary to shintoism

410
00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:56,100
 And now they're divided, but you do get some buddhas hidden in

411
00:32:56,100 --> 00:33:03,460
 Shrine still. Yes some sneaky buddhas. I don't believe that 40 000 temples in japan were destroyed during the meiji restaurant

412
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:11,300
 Because that's imperial rule was restored and that basically the buddhist religion had been quite closely associated with the previous dynasty

413
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:15,940
 And there were all sorts of rules like you had to affiliate yourself with the buddhist temple under the previous rules

414
00:33:15,940 --> 00:33:20,820
 And that was partly to prove you weren't christian and you had to do that just to lead a normal life

415
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:23,380
 Basically it was kind of a condition of citizenship. So I think a lot of

416
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:29,860
 Frustration had built up around that which is why when the meiji restoration happened all of these tens tens of thousands of

417
00:33:29,860 --> 00:33:31,940
 That's like half half the temples

418
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:37,620
 Obviously a very big country, but it's just the number of temples that it's just staggering. I think I went to a moss one

419
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:40,820
 Did you? Yeah, I think it was in Kyoto. I can't really remember

420
00:33:40,820 --> 00:33:44,100
 But I think you go over there and there's like a bucket of water

421
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:48,260
 And you have a spoon and you pour the water over the buddha or whatever it is

422
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:53,540
 And then it helps the moss to grow and it's really nice. I think you like say a wish and it comes true

423
00:33:53,540 --> 00:33:55,860
 My wish was already country

424
00:33:55,860 --> 00:33:59,780
 There's another one that helps you cure your warts

425
00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:06,580
 And the idea there is you put a coin in an offering box and you pick up a handful of salt and rub it in whichever area

426
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:09,220
 Has warts in it. Oh, and why didn't it work for you, James?

427
00:34:09,220 --> 00:34:16,020
 And there's another one I really like that I've never been to but it's a single word shrine

428
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:19,940
 And what you do is you put your coin in the box you clap your hands twice

429
00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:22,660
 And then your wish has to be a single word

430
00:34:22,660 --> 00:34:27,860
 So you can't say I wish to win 100 quid in the lottery

431
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:33,060
 You have to just say one word and if your wish doesn't edit down to one word, you can't have it

432
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:35,140
 That's quite good, Stammer

433
00:34:35,140 --> 00:34:42,420
 That and it's not so that um whatever god it is who's in control has a bit of leeway

434
00:34:42,420 --> 00:34:46,420
 So you could say cat and if the god wanted they could send a tiger to maul you to death

435
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:48,500
 Oh, yeah, that would have been good

436
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:50,340
 Like a monkey's paw

437
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:51,620
 Exactly, yeah

438
00:34:51,620 --> 00:34:55,540
 One of the good things is uh, if something traumatic happens in a westerners life

439
00:34:55,620 --> 00:35:02,980
 They often go to try and find themselves and there's an example. Um, which is uh, slightly topical, which is garrus southgate

440
00:35:02,980 --> 00:35:10,340
 So garrus southgate, uh, right after england football manager. England football manager. So the euros are currently on. Sorry. Yeah, sorry

441
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:16,100
 So back in the 90s. He famously botched a penalty kick and it was huge news

442
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:20,340
 Even though that that was yeah, when I got to the point where even his mother said to him, I quote

443
00:35:20,340 --> 00:35:22,420
 Why didn't you blast it dear?

444
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:24,820
 I need to get out of here

445
00:35:24,820 --> 00:35:29,140
 So he went to barley and uh, he thought I'm just going to get some rest

446
00:35:29,140 --> 00:35:35,380
 And so they stayed in this beautiful place where they were completely isolated and they found a stunning buddhist temple

447
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:40,260
 There were lakes and volcanoes nearby. He said it was absolutely magical and then he said in the distance

448
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:42,500
 He saw a monk associated with the temple

449
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:47,220
 Walk over to him. Yeah, and he comes up to him and the monk says

450
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:50,260
 You're garrus southgate. Oh mate that penalty

451
00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:55,700
 I'm paraphrasing though, but those are the those are the words he basically said

452
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:57,780
 buddha did not like that

453
00:35:57,780 --> 00:36:00,900
 buddha would have blasted that

454
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:06,740
 That's amazing. That's so funny. Sounds like she was advising the space program temple as well

455
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:16,180
 Have you heard of the shrine you go where you want to break up with someone? This is great. Oh, no, I haven't heard of that

456
00:36:16,180 --> 00:36:18,580
 Sounds like quite a roundabout way of doing it

457
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:23,540
 You're in the car on the way and I know nothing about this. I'll quickly google it. No, no, no. Wait till we get there

458
00:36:23,540 --> 00:36:27,140
 Basically, there's a whole there's a whole sort of subspecies of shrines

459
00:36:27,140 --> 00:36:30,180
 I think they're called engiri shrines and they the the local gods

460
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:34,900
 They give you the strength to cut ties between you and another of whatever kind so it might be a relationship

461
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:36,820
 might be a work thing might be anything

462
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:38,420
 um

463
00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:42,980
 And there's one for example Manto kuchi temple in gunma prefecture

464
00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:45,620
 Which is where women could escape their abusive husbands

465
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:49,940
 So it was quite an unusual kind of shrine because they're quite male environments

466
00:36:49,940 --> 00:36:55,220
 But this was a place where women could divorce their husbands and these days if you go there you can get a set of papers

467
00:36:55,220 --> 00:36:56,820
 They're either red or black

468
00:36:56,820 --> 00:37:00,660
 And you feel like one is I want a new relationship be formed and one is I want to break an old relationship

469
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:04,660
 You know how I was saying i'm the about you buying a ballot box for you and your wife

470
00:37:04,660 --> 00:37:06,820
 Oh, no

471
00:37:06,820 --> 00:37:12,980
 I open it on the the morning this episode is released dozens of japanese characters. I can't read

472
00:37:14,020 --> 00:37:16,020
 But all saying the same

473
00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:18,100
 same sad message

474
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:24,900
 But so you fill in these papers right you go into this special prayer area which contains two japanese squat toilets

475
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:29,060
 And you put your paper so it floats on the water for a few seconds

476
00:37:29,060 --> 00:37:32,660
 So it's not it's not also used as a squat toilet right do not use the toilet

477
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:40,980
 And then you flush your prayers and that is the way that it gets carried away. Yeah, that's that's a very unusual variety of

478
00:37:41,380 --> 00:37:46,500
 Try but it shows you the range they've got. Yeah, they've got a huge problem in japan, haven't they their rivers are just full of

479
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:48,740
 prayers

480
00:37:48,740 --> 00:37:52,980
 Very dangerous as women. Um, I don't know. We've never talked about the oldest temple in the world

481
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:55,460
 This is gobekli tepe in turkey

482
00:37:55,460 --> 00:38:01,620
 Which is quite recently confirmed to be the oldest in the world and it has um

483
00:38:01,620 --> 00:38:06,420
 A headless torso with an erect penis as part of its deco

484
00:38:07,220 --> 00:38:13,140
 It's these 60 massive pillars like limestone pillars that have all these engravings on them and they were

485
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:18,660
 Built 11 000 years ago and then deliberately all buried a couple of thousand years later

486
00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:24,980
 And yeah, they've got these amazing carvings on them and a lot of them are penis based obviously because the earliest temples

487
00:38:24,980 --> 00:38:30,740
 They were obviously worshipping penises and so they feature they also feature eyeless ducks in their sculptures

488
00:38:30,740 --> 00:38:33,780
 Which quite scary and also you've missed the penis

489
00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:38,180
 That's the one-eyed duck

490
00:38:38,180 --> 00:38:43,780
 But in the land of the eyeless ducks the one-eyed duck is king

491
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:53,060
 Sure, um, they also have scum carvings of boars foxes and a headless man with erections

492
00:38:53,060 --> 00:38:58,100
 Which the german and english text accompanying it mentioned and the turkish text does not wow

493
00:38:58,100 --> 00:39:02,580
 Yeah, but interestingly they think this temple is why we invented agriculture

494
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:08,980
 So it's unclear why this was built at a time when we were hunter-gatherers and moving around a lot

495
00:39:08,980 --> 00:39:11,300
 It was built before we'd settled agriculturally

496
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:16,980
 And it would have taken an enormous workforce and they would have stuck around for ages and ages to build it

497
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:21,700
 And they think it might be that to build this temple. They had to be like we need we need a permanent food source

498
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:25,140
 We need to get houses for all these people so that they can stick around and build it

499
00:39:25,140 --> 00:39:28,100
 And that was what led to the first agriculture

500
00:39:28,180 --> 00:39:32,500
 So it wasn't that we invented temples once we came up with farming in sat in one place

501
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:36,260
 We invented farming because of this temple right that is really cool

502
00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:41,620
 I was told one theory that the reason they buried it is because they knew that on orami was coming to take over

503
00:39:41,620 --> 00:39:46,660
 So they just all buried it and then when they arrived they just went, you know, nothing to see here

504
00:39:46,660 --> 00:39:52,580
 Wasn't there online map? It says there's a big city here. I think it's that yeah, it's that way

505
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:58,340
 Just go over this big mound. It's a little one-eyed duck sticking up here. Is that not something?

506
00:39:58,340 --> 00:40:03,620
 Do you know we've never talked about someone who must be one of Dan's favorite characters?

507
00:40:03,620 --> 00:40:09,620
 Um, just speaking of weird space programs the Zambian space program. Oh, right. Yeah. No, we haven't. Um, no

508
00:40:09,620 --> 00:40:14,740
 We haven't and I love this guy. So 1964, um, obviously Maricala's base program

509
00:40:14,740 --> 00:40:19,700
 Russia's space program USSR and Zambia had one and it was headed up by

510
00:40:20,340 --> 00:40:26,900
 Edward Makuka and Coloso who was a science teacher and he was director of the national academy of science based research and philosophy

511
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:28,420
 unofficial

512
00:40:28,420 --> 00:40:34,420
 Um, and he decided that they would be the first country to reach the moon. And yeah, they um, they actually never made it to the moon in the end

513
00:40:34,420 --> 00:40:37,300
 Yeah, I know it's weird, but they got really close

514
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:45,060
 Yeah, no they didn't he asked for a lot of billions of dollars of funding for various countries, but his methods were so fun

515
00:40:46,420 --> 00:40:50,980
 He so he recruited 12 afro-naughts and he did this whole

516
00:40:50,980 --> 00:40:54,980
 He made up that name and he invented this training regimen

517
00:40:54,980 --> 00:40:58,020
 Which included um, he'd shut them in an oil drum

518
00:40:58,020 --> 00:41:03,700
 And then he'd spin them around trees and roll them down hills in it so they could get used to um being weightless

519
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:08,260
 Being bullied they get used to being bullied which might happen if you're on a long space journey. Yeah

520
00:41:08,260 --> 00:41:11,460
 Well, if I'm on one

521
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:14,900
 You arrive at the moon with no lunch money

522
00:41:15,780 --> 00:41:17,780
 No days now

523
00:41:17,780 --> 00:41:21,620
 No, no, don't flush my head down the toilet. It's literally a vacuum into space

524
00:41:21,620 --> 00:41:36,820
 Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show and that is Anna my fact this week is that cats only come in two colors

525
00:41:36,820 --> 00:41:40,260
 Pink and brown

526
00:41:40,260 --> 00:41:44,260
 Well close

527
00:41:44,260 --> 00:41:49,140
 It's just it's just not true this isn't it? It's just it's not even I've seen cats that we've all seen cats

528
00:41:49,140 --> 00:41:53,220
 This is explained best I found by the cat fancies association

529
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:55,620
 Who has a very an excellent

530
00:41:55,620 --> 00:41:57,380
 I would think so

531
00:41:57,380 --> 00:41:59,380
 I'm not surprised if not dogs are us

532
00:41:59,380 --> 00:42:06,580
 They are an excellent um sort of paper on this and basically explain that um

533
00:42:06,580 --> 00:42:13,780
 All cats have two colors black or red and all the colors you think you're seeing on cats are just kind of degrees of black and red

534
00:42:14,100 --> 00:42:15,860
 My cat is blue

535
00:42:15,860 --> 00:42:18,820
 Thank you for raising blue at this early stage james

536
00:42:18,820 --> 00:42:24,420
 So um black and red are expressed by the b gene which stands for brown in fact because black is just very dark brown

537
00:42:24,420 --> 00:42:26,900
 and the o gene

538
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:28,500
 Which is orange

539
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:33,860
 We're learning so much about colors in this episode, aren't we? They're just not what you saw. I haven't learned anything weirdly

540
00:42:33,860 --> 00:42:35,300
 It's too

541
00:42:35,300 --> 00:42:36,420
 complicated

542
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:40,660
 Your blue cat as you say is just dark brown which doesn't exist by the way

543
00:42:40,660 --> 00:42:46,180
 There's nothing as brown, but if it gets really dark, it's black. I'm just I'm not saying black itself as a color is dark brown

544
00:42:46,180 --> 00:42:48,260
 I'm saying the black you see on cats is actually dark brown

545
00:42:48,260 --> 00:42:53,940
 Okay, and actually often if you have a black cat it goes browner james your blue cat is just a dilute of black

546
00:42:53,940 --> 00:42:59,140
 Hmm. What does that mean? It means it's got the black slash brown gene

547
00:42:59,140 --> 00:43:04,100
 But then on top of that it's got the dilution gene and that turns black into blue

548
00:43:04,100 --> 00:43:06,260
 But it's still black. It's just added some water

549
00:43:06,340 --> 00:43:12,500
 My cat is perfect and I don't like you saying her genes are diluted diluted cat. Sorry mate. What are we doing with white?

550
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:14,980
 Is that just the blank canvas you get? Oh my god, Dan

551
00:43:14,980 --> 00:43:19,060
 You phrase the most difficult question right at the top as the cat fancies admit

552
00:43:19,060 --> 00:43:24,500
 White is the biggest problem the thing to know about white and you're not going to like this guys

553
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:29,540
 But this is according to cat fancies white is not a color. Okay. Oh, I buy that

554
00:43:29,540 --> 00:43:34,500
 It's a shade. I would say yeah, black and white aren't really colors. Black is a color though in this instance

555
00:43:34,580 --> 00:43:37,620
 Yeah, that's that's what's very brown. This is dark brown

556
00:43:37,620 --> 00:43:42,260
 But the thing with white is the um your white cat is actually either brown or orange

557
00:43:42,260 --> 00:43:46,260
 So your white cat has genes for either being a black cat or an orange cat

558
00:43:46,260 --> 00:43:49,460
 But then it also has a kit gene quite nicely named

559
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:54,900
 Which covers up those and often you can see the true color of the cat on its head

560
00:43:54,900 --> 00:43:57,700
 So if you've got a white cat with a tiny bit of orange on its head

561
00:43:57,700 --> 00:44:02,020
 It's actually an orange cat and if it mates with another cat then they'll likely be orange

562
00:44:02,180 --> 00:44:06,180
 I think I follow that because I I was reading that orange cats are likely to be male

563
00:44:06,180 --> 00:44:09,380
 Yeah, almost always. Okay, and that's because

564
00:44:09,380 --> 00:44:14,340
 The genetic information of the cat's color is found on the x chromosome

565
00:44:14,340 --> 00:44:18,580
 Yeah, and females have two x's like in humans and males have an x and a y like in humans

566
00:44:18,580 --> 00:44:23,940
 So if the male's single x chromosome is orange, that's just an orange cat

567
00:44:23,940 --> 00:44:27,380
 Yeah, and a male can never have both black and orange

568
00:44:27,380 --> 00:44:31,620
 That's true. Exactly. So if you have a tortoise shell cat, which is like orange and black and white and stuff

569
00:44:31,860 --> 00:44:36,260
 It has to be female because it's got two x's and one x can be black and one can be orange

570
00:44:36,260 --> 00:44:41,780
 Except there are very few males that have an extra x chromosome, which is really rare. They're x x y

571
00:44:41,780 --> 00:44:46,340
 That's really rare. So they can be tortoise shell huge if you've got one of those

572
00:44:46,340 --> 00:44:52,020
 That's but that's a real it's really rare and the other type you can have male tortoise shells is if it's a chimera

573
00:44:52,020 --> 00:44:54,660
 So you start off with an egg and a sperm

574
00:44:54,660 --> 00:45:01,220
 But then another egg and sperm come in and then you've got two embryos and they fuse together to make one cat

575
00:45:02,180 --> 00:45:09,460
 Okay chimeras and then like you get some chimeras where you get a cat and half of it is one color and half

576
00:45:09,460 --> 00:45:12,740
 It's the other color and it's exactly halfway down the body. Are you kidding? Really?

577
00:45:12,740 --> 00:45:17,940
 That's a great thing for a murder mystery plotline. Like the cat that was coming into the room

578
00:45:17,940 --> 00:45:21,460
 What color was it? Two people give different answers and that affects who the killer is

579
00:45:21,460 --> 00:45:25,380
 It's also really good for those panto skits where you play the man and the woman

580
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:30,500
 That push and boots is going to be electric

581
00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:36,580
 It's so weird this stuff. It's fascinating. It is quite fascinating. One can go a bit too deep

582
00:45:36,580 --> 00:45:40,180
 I actually found this fact reading an article about a new cat color that has been discovered

583
00:45:40,180 --> 00:45:45,220
 So there could be a claim that there's a third color. Oh, yeah, and that is salty licorice

584
00:45:45,220 --> 00:45:47,860
 And this has just been discovered

585
00:45:47,860 --> 00:45:52,100
 It's a white chest and paws and then it's got black body with like white speckles on it

586
00:45:52,100 --> 00:45:56,820
 And they're missing a chunk of DNA. So that's genetically totally different to anything we've seen before

587
00:45:57,060 --> 00:45:59,060
 It sounds black in color

588
00:45:59,060 --> 00:46:02,100
 No, it's not it's like salty licorice

589
00:46:02,100 --> 00:46:06,580
 It's like it's like someone with black hair that's going sort of patchy gray, right?

590
00:46:06,580 --> 00:46:11,220
 That's it interesting and their hair starts out black and then it fades to white by the time it gets to the end of the hair

591
00:46:11,220 --> 00:46:14,900
 So it's kind of that strange and I can't believe having done this podcast for 10 years

592
00:46:14,900 --> 00:46:19,140
 You think oh everything's been discovered and then they found a new color of cat in the last year

593
00:46:19,140 --> 00:46:24,180
 Do you know the word licorice? Yeah, it means this food this delicious food. Yeah

594
00:46:24,900 --> 00:46:29,940
 But it also had two old meanings. It meant lecherous or someone who enjoys liquor

595
00:46:29,940 --> 00:46:35,540
 So if you were licorice, it meant you really like drinking alcohol because you like drinking licorice

596
00:46:35,540 --> 00:46:39,300
 And then it also meant lecherous because you might lick things

597
00:46:39,300 --> 00:46:45,460
 It's actually true. It's not related to the word lecherous. This is like an old 18th century meaning

598
00:46:45,460 --> 00:46:49,780
 It was like someone that licked a lot of things was lecherous and therefore they were licorice

599
00:46:49,780 --> 00:46:52,740
 Um cats

600
00:46:52,740 --> 00:46:54,500
 Yeah, when they are

601
00:46:54,500 --> 00:46:55,700
 growing

602
00:46:55,700 --> 00:46:57,700
 in the womb

603
00:46:57,700 --> 00:47:00,340
 This is cool about where they get the color from

604
00:47:00,340 --> 00:47:06,900
 So the color cells all grow along their back. They're called neural crest cells. These are the color cells, okay?

605
00:47:06,900 --> 00:47:11,780
 And they start building up and then they migrate around the body of the embryo

606
00:47:11,780 --> 00:47:17,060
 And they can get all the way around in which case you'll have a cat that's one color

607
00:47:17,060 --> 00:47:22,340
 Oh, is that why you have white bellies? They can get only part of the way around well different patches of color

608
00:47:22,580 --> 00:47:27,700
 Basically, you'll have like white socks. Yeah, if they don't make it all the way around or a hitler moustache

609
00:47:27,700 --> 00:47:35,460
 And yeah, that's it and whether your cat is one color or different colors is completely dependent on how far those cells

610
00:47:35,460 --> 00:47:38,980
 Migrate it around the body of the cat in embryo form

611
00:47:38,980 --> 00:47:45,380
 That's so interesting. So cool. Is it so often you see a white belly on a cat and it's just the belly is too far from the spine to

612
00:47:45,380 --> 00:47:50,340
 Have yeah, basically all the way around. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's bizarre. And those socks are weird as well

613
00:47:50,740 --> 00:47:54,900
 Does your cat doesn't have socks? No, she's a perfect all one color. Okay

614
00:47:54,900 --> 00:47:59,940
 Your breed as foe of the podcast that old Hitler would approve

615
00:47:59,940 --> 00:48:05,860
 So the cats with socks, you know the white little white socks that you get they're lovely

616
00:48:05,860 --> 00:48:08,500
 But they are because we domesticated cats

617
00:48:08,500 --> 00:48:12,660
 Because pre-domestication that would have been a terrible idea for a cat to have because they're hunting

618
00:48:12,660 --> 00:48:16,260
 And if you see a big white sock clumping towards you, obviously you spot the cat

619
00:48:16,740 --> 00:48:22,500
 So but early humans probably would have bred for that. There's a nice feature to have a breed of cat with socks like them

620
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:29,060
 Yeah, that's very cool. Um, your cats are all the same, right? As in not your cat james, which is what special and perfect

621
00:48:29,060 --> 00:48:34,020
 But but you know what I mean like most cats look more like other cats than dogs look like other dogs

622
00:48:34,020 --> 00:48:37,540
 I see so you don't get like little sausage cats

623
00:48:37,540 --> 00:48:42,340
 Or great big cats or like bully excel cats. It just doesn't happen

624
00:48:42,980 --> 00:48:47,220
 And that's really interesting because there's no actual reason why

625
00:48:47,220 --> 00:48:50,180
 We couldn't have done that, right?

626
00:48:50,180 --> 00:48:55,300
 So and the reason is how long have we been breeding dogs for different purposes centuries?

627
00:48:55,300 --> 00:49:01,860
 Yeah millennia millennia. Yeah, and you breed a dog to hunt otters or like a dachshund to hunt badgers in their sets or to

628
00:49:01,860 --> 00:49:05,300
 Whatever pick up um grouse that you've just shot or whatever

629
00:49:05,300 --> 00:49:11,700
 All these different things whereas cats have fulfilled basically the same function all that time which is vermin in the home

630
00:49:12,180 --> 00:49:15,220
 And companionship, right? If we'd put our work in

631
00:49:15,220 --> 00:49:21,380
 500 years ago as humans we could now have like you're lost in the alps and then there's a cat with a barrel of brandy around its neck

632
00:49:21,380 --> 00:49:28,020
 That comes and yeah saves you a terrifying cat guard when you hear the meow walking past a farm you tense up and freak out

633
00:49:28,020 --> 00:49:33,940
 All kind we could have had every single cat under the sun every single dog could have had his mirror cat

634
00:49:33,940 --> 00:49:38,260
 I think this is actually a kids book ready to grow it is

635
00:49:38,260 --> 00:49:41,940
 It absolutely is sausage cat would be I'd read that

636
00:49:42,900 --> 00:49:46,100
 To a child that's amazing. Is it happening though or people?

637
00:49:46,100 --> 00:49:52,740
 Well, no, but like, you know, why not why why haven't we started doing it people do breed amazing like yeah

638
00:49:52,740 --> 00:49:58,260
 Yes, like James is amazing British short-haired cats. There are breeds. Yeah, but they're not being bred to turn spits

639
00:49:58,260 --> 00:50:02,580
 They're all basically being bred because we like the look of them really. Yes. Yeah, I think

640
00:50:02,580 --> 00:50:07,700
 Or some of them like the British shorthairs wear bred for hunting prowess

641
00:50:08,740 --> 00:50:12,580
 You're well my cat is the most useless cat in history

642
00:50:12,580 --> 00:50:17,220
 But like her breed was bred for chasing birds and stuff like that

643
00:50:17,220 --> 00:50:19,380
 It still does seem to me

644
00:50:19,380 --> 00:50:22,820
 Not the number sceptical about this claim because I'm not this explanation

645
00:50:22,820 --> 00:50:27,220
 But that cats still seem to have less variety than you'd expect from lots of breeding

646
00:50:27,220 --> 00:50:31,860
 In in terms of size for instance, if we have bred some for hunting

647
00:50:31,860 --> 00:50:36,420
 Um, it's very interesting that you can get tiny tiny chihuahuas and giants and burners

648
00:50:36,740 --> 00:50:42,340
 And with cats, there's not much variety. If we'd wanted to could we have taken an ordinary domestic cat and bred it into the size of a lion

649
00:50:42,340 --> 00:50:46,340
 Could we have reinvented a cycle? Yes, but I think the other thing is that domestic cats

650
00:50:46,340 --> 00:50:52,500
 Are hunters all of them pretty much. And so if you do breed a massive cat

651
00:50:52,500 --> 00:50:56,820
 It's not going to be a lap cat. It's gonna like it's going to go after you, isn't it?

652
00:50:56,820 --> 00:50:59,780
 Well, the owner is behind it saying he's very friendly

653
00:50:59,780 --> 00:51:02,900
 This is not the cat he is actually

654
00:51:04,580 --> 00:51:09,060
 The hairless cat that was a kind of oh, yeah, that was a useful thing. They were trying to invent

655
00:51:09,060 --> 00:51:12,020
 Well for people who wanted cats who were allergic to cat hair

656
00:51:12,020 --> 00:51:14,900
 That was a big idea, but you can't once you've taken off all the hair

657
00:51:14,900 --> 00:51:18,900
 I would argue it's no longer really the same kind of experience of cat ownership

658
00:51:18,900 --> 00:51:22,420
 You've always wanted a cat and you were so sad you couldn't have one

659
00:51:22,420 --> 00:51:24,500
 Gollum calls into the room

660
00:51:24,500 --> 00:51:29,220
 Well, like that's Sphinx cats. They look like Gollum really. Yeah, they do. They don't look good

661
00:51:29,220 --> 00:51:33,060
 But it was a slightly pointless exercise as well because it's not just the hair that people are allergic to

662
00:51:33,140 --> 00:51:38,020
 There's stuff in their saliva, which is yeah, so at the time it was believed the hair was a simple thing

663
00:51:38,020 --> 00:51:42,260
 But now there's just this naked cat that's still and they haven't they didn't breathe the dry mouth. No

664
00:51:42,260 --> 00:51:48,180
 You know, I Sphinx cats are from I'll jump on it Egypt

665
00:51:48,180 --> 00:51:52,580
 I did read actually, but yeah Toronto Toronto

666
00:51:52,580 --> 00:51:59,460
 It was three weird number of hairless kittens were found in Toronto in the 70s

667
00:51:59,460 --> 00:52:02,260
 And they bred them and bred them and so now they're all hairless

668
00:52:02,580 --> 00:52:03,540
 Nice

669
00:52:03,540 --> 00:52:05,060
 I was on um

670
00:52:05,060 --> 00:52:08,100
 I think I'm a scientific american. Yeah, I was on scientific american

671
00:52:08,100 --> 00:52:13,060
 I came across a headline which was what is the difference between hair and fur

672
00:52:13,060 --> 00:52:19,540
 We spoke with memalogist Nancy Simmons of the american museum of natural history about this. Here's the transcript

673
00:52:19,540 --> 00:52:21,220
 Is this gettable?

674
00:52:21,220 --> 00:52:22,180
 Yes

675
00:52:22,180 --> 00:52:25,940
 Okay, fur on animals hair on humans. No hair on monkeys. I guess

676
00:52:25,940 --> 00:52:28,580
 Is there a fur on monkeys? I'd say. Oh, yeah

677
00:52:28,580 --> 00:52:31,540
 If you comb it it's hair if you brush it it's fur

678
00:52:31,860 --> 00:52:34,820
 Right. No, you brush you brush your head. Sorry. No, no, no, no

679
00:52:34,820 --> 00:52:42,260
 Is it structured different as in no more keratin hair grows only on your head fur grows

680
00:52:42,260 --> 00:52:45,220
 your chest

681
00:52:45,220 --> 00:52:52,420
 I'm gonna put you out of your misery

682
00:52:52,420 --> 00:52:59,860
 Scientific american asks is there a difference between hair and fur? Nancy Simmons replies. There isn't hair and fur are the same thing

683
00:53:00,580 --> 00:53:05,860
 I know disappointing. Okay. Here's the craziest thing I found researching this. Okay, you can give dog blood to a cat

684
00:53:05,860 --> 00:53:13,060
 To eat or to to not to drink to infuse to if a cat needs a blood transplant

685
00:53:13,060 --> 00:53:15,620
 It can take dog blood

686
00:53:15,620 --> 00:53:20,820
 I find that very difficult to believe. Hashtag more in common. Um, but only once

687
00:53:20,820 --> 00:53:24,740
 Because they die

688
00:53:24,740 --> 00:53:27,300
 You can drink a pint of arsenic, but only once

689
00:53:28,340 --> 00:53:34,340
 They don't die the first time you do it, but they will die the second. This is insane. So there are dog blood banks, but they do have nine lives

690
00:53:34,340 --> 00:53:38,820
 There are dog blood banks, which is great for dogs

691
00:53:38,820 --> 00:53:42,740
 But there are very few for cats because for a cat to give blood takes a lot of the cat's blood

692
00:53:42,740 --> 00:53:44,740
 And it's just a very it's harder to do, right?

693
00:53:44,740 --> 00:53:47,780
 But if your cat needs a blood transfusion it can take some dog blood

694
00:53:47,780 --> 00:53:51,860
 But then it develops antibodies to the dog blood after the first time it gets some

695
00:53:51,860 --> 00:53:56,180
 So the second time you give it a transfusion it will it may react very badly and could die

696
00:53:56,580 --> 00:54:02,100
 But basically there will be cats walking around right now, which are half dog and dogs if you're listening

697
00:54:02,100 --> 00:54:06,740
 Please donate today. Yeah, you know, you could be saving a cat's life

698
00:54:06,740 --> 00:54:09,220
 That's not the way to advertise it to dogs, actually

699
00:54:09,220 --> 00:54:14,020
 Um, I love that we have classical sort of dog people and cat people right

700
00:54:14,020 --> 00:54:20,020
 My favorite example of it is that the fact that that made it in to the webster's dictionary the original in 1928

701
00:54:20,580 --> 00:54:25,380
 So yeah, webster, he did an he did an initial dictionary, which was in 1806

702
00:54:25,380 --> 00:54:30,260
 And in it he used the exact same phrase to describe a dog in a cat, which is just a domestic animal

703
00:54:30,260 --> 00:54:36,980
 However, when he published his dictionary in 1828 he defined a dog as a species of quadrupeds belonging to the genus canis

704
00:54:36,980 --> 00:54:41,700
 And many varieties as the mastiff the hound the spaniel the shepherd's dog the terrier the harrier

705
00:54:41,700 --> 00:54:44,260
 Keeps going on with cats

706
00:54:44,260 --> 00:54:49,380
 He describes the cat as it is a deceitful animal and when enraged extremely spiteful

707
00:54:50,260 --> 00:54:52,260
 That's it

708
00:54:52,260 --> 00:54:58,020
 Really thought in did you guys think he meant in the dictionary he was going to have cat person and dog person?

709
00:54:58,020 --> 00:55:02,660
 Webster was a dog person. Yeah, he clearly was

710
00:55:02,660 --> 00:55:06,180
 That's brilliant

711
00:55:06,180 --> 00:55:08,260
 James cat cat person clearly

712
00:55:08,260 --> 00:55:15,300
 Actually really a neither person I think but I've had a cat forced upon me. Okay. Oh, okay. You're a people person

713
00:55:15,300 --> 00:55:17,780
 I wouldn't say that

714
00:55:19,700 --> 00:55:23,460
 I'm uh, you're barely you're barely a person. I'm a bacterial phage person

715
00:55:23,460 --> 00:55:26,580
 Yes, finally

716
00:55:26,580 --> 00:55:28,980
 Someone will stick up for those guys

717
00:55:28,980 --> 00:55:36,420
