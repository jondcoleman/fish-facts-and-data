00:00:00,00:00:10,"Hey Clubfish members, it is Dan here. Welcome to your bonus compilation episode."
00:00:10,00:00:15,"This is all of the outtakes, all of the bloopers, the tangents, basically all the bits that"
00:00:15,00:00:20,didn't fit into the main narrative of the episodes. But stuff that we didn't want to get rid
00:00:20,00:00:24,of and so we've brought it all together here in one handy compilation. But before we
00:00:24,00:00:28,"get into it, I just want to remind anyone who hasn't seen the news. We're doing a couple"
00:00:28,00:00:33,of live shows very soon. We are going to be playing the London podcast festival. And the
00:00:33,00:00:38,fun thing about this is usually it's just a gig and I believe the two gigs are actually
00:00:38,00:00:41,"sold out if you want to be there physically. However, we're going to be live streaming"
00:00:41,00:00:45,"the gigs. Now in the past, I know this has been really fun because as you're watching the"
00:00:45,00:00:49,"live stream, you can actually comment underneath as the show is going along. It's a really"
00:00:49,00:00:54,cool way of meeting fellow fish listeners if you've not done that before. So why not check
00:00:54,00:01:00,it out. The link is on our website. We're doing the fifth and sixth of September. We've partially
00:01:00,00:01:05,announced the guest who's going to be joining us on the sixth and that is Richard Osman.
00:01:05,00:01:09,So that's going to be really awesome. We'll be announcing our other guest very soon for
00:01:09,00:01:14,"the fifth. But as I say, tickets are available. You can watch it as it's happening live on"
00:01:14,00:01:18,stage. So we've also got another live show announcement coming up. We'll be announcing
00:01:18,00:01:22,at the top of this week's show. So keep a listen out for that in case it happens to be
00:01:22,00:01:27,in a town near you. And that's it for the admin. So let's get on with it. This is a big
00:01:27,00:01:30,old chunky compilation episode. Here we go.
00:01:48,00:01:53,"Yeah, you mentioned Braveheart in this time and the Battle of Sterling Bridge happened"
00:01:53,00:01:57,then. I like this from Wikipedia. The Battle of Sterling Bridge is depicted in the 1995
00:01:57,00:02:02,"film Braveheart, but it bears little resemblance to the real battle. Most egregiously, there"
00:02:02,00:02:10,being no bridge. But that is the time when supposedly the Scots lifted their kilts and
00:02:10,00:02:15,"showed their bums. It's interesting to show it to scare the English, but we have no evidence"
00:02:15,00:02:20,to that happen. There's no contemporary evidence to that happen. But we do have a 40th century
00:02:20,00:02:25,account of the English doing that against the Scottish jury in those wars.
00:02:25,00:02:30,"Dropping their trousers. Yeah, really? In the Chronicle of Peter Langtoft, they mentioned"
00:02:30,00:02:35,the English doing that. No way. And did it what did scare the Scots? Or did it make them
00:02:35,00:02:39,"think, oh, open target? I think we haven't seen before, you know? We've all got them,"
00:02:39,00:02:46,"you know? Why are they, why are they triangular? Giants? Yeah. You know how they've got the"
00:02:46,00:02:49,"point at the front? Yeah. They're shaped like a boat, basically. Yes, yeah. I think to carve"
00:02:49,00:02:53,"a route through the close, much like a boat through the water. Probably for a shape,"
00:02:53,00:02:58,the opposite. It would be harder to do the ironing. I think so. Why don't you try doing
00:02:58,00:03:03,it backwards next time? That's a really good idea. That's a really good idea. And why is
00:03:03,00:03:09,the shape lined up with my shirt on back to the front? You're not there. My head's on your
00:03:09,00:03:16,head. I'd be frantically searching for the why. We used to have double pointed back to
00:03:16,00:03:21,"front reversible ones, which would save you having the whole trousers on your head, Palava."
00:03:21,00:03:28,"I would see like a sort of, like a leaf, I suppose. Like a canoe. Or a canoe. Yes. And keep"
00:03:28,00:03:34,the boat analogy going. Yeah. Which we should do throughout. And these were the most popular
00:03:34,00:03:40,"iron from about 1870 to the 1930s, 40s when electric irons came in. And they were invented"
00:03:40,00:03:46,by this woman called Mary Pots. So she basically invented the iron that people were using in
00:03:46,00:03:51,"the late 19th, early 20th century. And she got lots of patterns for it. So she made it hollow."
00:03:51,00:03:56,So it wasn't as heavy. And it also didn't get so dangerously hot because she filled the
00:03:56,00:04:00,inside with wool or something non-heat conducting. Because people were constantly burning their
00:04:00,00:04:06,"hands. And she invented the removable handle. So you could constantly have, you could be"
00:04:06,00:04:10,heating up one iron while you were using the other. And then you could swap the iron onto
00:04:10,00:04:14,"the handle. That's really Palava. Why can't they both just have a handle? Sorry, I mean,"
00:04:14,00:04:19,"where's the handle would probably heat up, right? Get super hot. Yeah. Yeah. It's like"
00:04:19,00:04:24,"when you cook an egg, sometimes that handle got like go. I don't hold onto the pan all"
00:04:24,00:04:29,the way through the cooking process. You've got to rip the rim of the pan with both hands
00:04:29,00:04:40,"ideally. As the saying goes, a held part always boils. John Harvey Kellogg. Okay. Cornflakes"
00:04:40,00:04:46,pioneer and anti-fiddling around with yourself. Yep. Advocate. Go back to early episodes to see
00:04:46,00:04:53,what the hell that's referring to. Yes. We won't tell you which one. We answer all 580.
00:04:53,00:04:59,I believe he invented an early sunbed. He believed it could cure almost everything. And there
00:04:59,00:05:03,"was a big thing of sun therapy where high altitude sunbathing in particular, because it gave"
00:05:03,00:05:08,"you supposedly more unfiltered ultraviolet rays, which was especially good for you at the"
00:05:08,00:05:13,"time, as we now know is not the case. It's weird because there were some truths to this"
00:05:13,00:05:18,"idea at the time. I guess Kellogg thought that it filled your skin with blood, which drew"
00:05:18,00:05:23,"blood away from your diseased organs, which wasn't correct. But the seventh did, in fact,"
00:05:23,00:05:29,"install one of his sun baths in the palace in 1903, where you sat in a chair, which was"
00:05:29,00:05:33,"fully enclosed, and it had 52 light bulbs around you that could glow any colour for different"
00:05:33,00:05:38,health benefits. Right. But at the same time that one of the first Nobel Prizes was awarded
00:05:38,00:05:45,"for discovering the benefits of light therapy on tuberculosis and TB. Yeah, exactly. Which"
00:05:45,00:05:51,"was basically true, Neil's finson. Yeah. And then the open lots of salaria, didn't they"
00:05:51,00:05:55,"all over Europe, which were basically for patients who were sick with stuff where you"
00:05:55,00:05:59,"had these amazing sunning hospitals, which the NHS would never fund today. But where you"
00:05:59,00:06:03,"could lie in this room, and the entire roof would retract on a sunny day, so you could be"
00:06:03,00:06:07,"exposed to the sun, or giant balconies where your whole big bed would be wheeled out"
00:06:07,00:06:11,"onto them. Yeah. And that was, was good for you. Yeah. But I don't know about the Kellogg"
00:06:11,00:06:18,"- No, it doesn't cure gout and constipation like Kellogg claimed."
00:06:18,00:06:29,"- If you go to the beach and you get a suntan, then it's mostly due to the sun."
00:06:29,00:06:30,- Carry on professor.
00:06:30,00:06:35,"- However, not point, not, not, not, not, not, not, not, not,"
00:06:35,00:06:39,1% of the radiation comes from stars beyond the galaxy.
00:06:39,00:06:41,"- Oh, that's great."
00:06:41,00:06:47,"- Because it's photons coming from, you know, from outer outer space that come onto our earth."
00:06:47,00:06:52,And a certain amount of those photons will go into your body and they will cause your body to sound.
00:06:52,00:06:53,- That's so cool.
00:06:53,00:06:56,"- If you get a night suntan, and how, I suppose it would take too long."
00:06:56,00:07:00,- I think it would take too long given the number of zeros in that number.
00:07:00,00:07:04,"- So with that photon, that's travelled billions of miles across the universe."
00:07:04,00:07:05,Is that the endpoint?
00:07:05,00:07:07,- Your absorbs into your body.
00:07:07,00:07:10,"- For the endpoint for this, so ton of lights, that is travelled."
00:07:10,00:07:12,- Is that true? Is that what it would be?
00:07:12,00:07:13,"- Yeah, it would itself into your body."
00:07:13,00:07:18,"- Wow, I read a thing as well that not only do we get that not point, not, not whatever it is,"
00:07:18,00:07:24,"percentage of our suntan from the stars beyond our sun, but also from the leftover of the big bang."
00:07:24,00:07:25,"- Yeah, that's plausible."
00:07:25,00:07:28,"- Tarn of the big bang, a bang tan."
00:07:28,00:07:29,Cool.
00:07:29,00:07:30,- That's pretty well.
00:07:30,00:07:31,- That's awesome.
00:07:31,00:07:32,- Really good.
00:07:32,00:07:33,- There's another one.
00:07:33,00:07:36,This one definitely has some kind of meaning to it.
00:07:36,00:07:42,"So in Melanesian legend, they had two gods called Tagaro and Sukumatuwa."
00:07:42,00:07:45,And they shared the work of creation.
00:07:45,00:07:49,"But whenever Tagaro did something, he did it well."
00:07:49,00:07:52,And Sukumatuwa did it really badly.
00:07:52,00:07:56,"And so when they made trees, Tagaro made really nice food."
00:07:56,00:08:02,"And Sukumatuwa was really bitter, and stuff like that."
00:08:02,00:08:06,Sukumatuwa wanted to have men sleep in the trunks of sego palms.
00:08:06,00:08:11,"But Tagaro thought, no, they should live in houses instead and stuff like that."
00:08:11,00:08:17,"And when they created men, Tagaro said that humans should have anuses."
00:08:17,00:08:21,"But Sukumatuwa said, no, they definitely shouldn't have anuses."
00:08:21,00:08:27,"And as a result, the ones that he made swelled up and burst because they could not defecate."
00:08:27,00:08:33,"- Again, it's the meaning. Do the job properly? Do you work?"
00:08:33,00:08:36,- I think it's like literally half of it.
00:08:36,00:08:39,"- It's like the, don't zero ask it."
00:08:39,00:08:41,"It's like the Yin and the Yang, right?"
00:08:41,00:08:44,"It's like you always have to have the, not good and evil in this case,"
00:08:44,00:08:48,but sort of good and not very good.
00:08:48,00:08:49,"- Right, right, right."
00:08:49,00:08:50,"And it's, yeah, yeah."
00:08:50,00:08:51,I think we've just invented a new phrase.
00:08:51,00:08:54,"I think we could just say, you've no asked this."
00:08:54,00:08:55,- Yeah.
00:08:55,00:08:56,- He's really no asked that project.
00:08:56,00:08:58,- I think that's good.
00:08:58,00:09:02,- I think like the bass language actually is quite good for onomatopoeic words.
00:09:02,00:09:03,- Right.
00:09:03,00:09:05,- So words that sound like they're supposed to be.
00:09:05,00:09:07,So do you know what pill pill?
00:09:07,00:09:08,- It's your medicine?
00:09:08,00:09:09,- A pill.
00:09:09,00:09:10,"- Yeah, two pills."
00:09:10,00:09:11,"- No, no, it's onomatopoeic."
00:09:11,00:09:14,It's going to sound like the thing pill pill.
00:09:14,00:09:17,"- A laser, a laser, a space laser in a film."
00:09:17,00:09:18,"- Oh, yeah."
00:09:18,00:09:19,"- Oh, that would be pew, pew."
00:09:19,00:09:20,"- Oh, yes."
00:09:20,00:09:23,- It's the word for boiling liquid.
00:09:23,00:09:24,"- Okay, nice to see you."
00:09:24,00:09:25,"- Tren, pull pill."
00:09:25,00:09:26,- Tren.
00:09:26,00:09:27,- T-tren again.
00:09:27,00:09:28,- Tren.
00:09:28,00:09:29,- Tren.
00:09:29,00:09:30,- Tren.
00:09:30,00:09:31,- Tren.
00:09:31,00:09:32,- Tren.
00:09:32,00:09:33,- Tren.
00:09:33,00:09:34,- Tren.
00:09:34,00:09:35,- Tren.
00:09:35,00:09:36,- Tren.
00:09:36,00:09:37,- Tren.
00:09:37,00:09:38,- Tren.
00:09:38,00:09:39,- Tren.
00:09:39,00:09:40,- Tren.
00:09:40,00:09:41,- Tren.
00:09:41,00:09:42,- Tren.
00:09:42,00:09:43,- Tren.
00:09:43,00:09:44,- Tren.
00:09:44,00:09:45,- Tren.
00:09:45,00:09:46,- Tren.
00:09:46,00:09:48,- And what about this one?
00:09:48,00:09:49,Chiza.
00:09:49,00:09:50,- Chiza.
00:09:50,00:09:51,- Chiza.
00:09:51,00:09:52,- Chiza.
00:09:52,00:09:55,(laughing)
00:09:55,00:09:57,"Yes, it's their word for Tom Jones."
00:09:57,00:09:57,(laughing)
00:09:57,00:10:00,"No, did he say no, I don't know."
00:10:00,00:10:04,And it's their word for urinating.
00:10:04,00:10:07,"Jesus, she's a, she's a, she's a, she's a, she's a,"
00:10:07,00:10:09,"she's a, like piss, pissing, I guess."
00:10:09,00:10:11,"Oh, not the sound that comes out,"
00:10:11,00:10:13,"'cause I'd see a doctor if it's saying,"
00:10:13,00:10:13,Jesus.
00:10:13,00:10:15,(laughing)
00:10:15,00:10:17,"I'm not sure, I think the most first of a girl,"
00:10:17,00:10:18,I don't quite understand that last one.
00:10:18,00:10:21,I think actually maybe the word piss
00:10:21,00:10:22,is quite onomatopoeic.
00:10:22,00:10:23,"Well, yeah."
00:10:23,00:10:24,"It's my fluid, isn't it?"
00:10:24,00:10:25,"You're right, yes."
00:10:25,00:10:27,Do you know the word bum is onomatopoeic?
00:10:27,00:10:28,Bum.
00:10:28,00:10:30,"You mean our word bum, the word itself."
00:10:30,00:10:32,"Is it, oh, 'cause it looks like a,"
00:10:32,00:10:33,that's the only thing.
00:10:33,00:10:34,That's the only thing.
00:10:34,00:10:37,Onomatopoeic means it makes the noise.
00:10:37,00:10:38,Yes.
00:10:38,00:10:41,"So, it's like a fat noise, basically."
00:10:41,00:10:43,"Bum, bum."
00:10:43,00:10:43,That's interesting.
00:10:43,00:10:44,"It's the OED, anyway."
00:10:44,00:10:47,"What's it called then, what I've just mentioned,"
00:10:47,00:10:49,when a word looks like this object?
00:10:49,00:10:51,I don't know if there's a word for that.
00:10:51,00:10:53,I think it's called being made up.
00:10:53,00:10:56,"Bed looks a bit like a bed,"
00:10:56,00:10:58,"'cause you've got the two posts at either end,"
00:10:58,00:10:59,and then you've got the curly mattress
00:10:59,00:11:00,going all the way along.
00:11:00,00:11:03,"A famously, Dan said that the word golf"
00:11:03,00:11:05,"looks like someone playing golf,"
00:11:05,00:11:06,"'cause the O is the ball,"
00:11:06,00:11:10,"and the L is the club, and the F is the flag."
00:11:10,00:11:11,Is the word string that?
00:11:11,00:11:13,"Word string looks like a long piece of string,"
00:11:13,00:11:15,if you laid it out in the shape of the word string.
00:11:15,00:11:16,Can I do it?
00:11:16,00:11:18,Yeah.
00:11:18,00:11:19,Really?
00:11:19,00:11:20,We need a word for this.
00:11:20,00:11:22,"It's easy to dance if there isn't one, make it up."
00:11:22,00:11:23,Yeah.
00:11:23,00:11:25,"They have strong links with the UK, actually,"
00:11:25,00:11:28,"the BASC people, because they used to be ships,"
00:11:28,00:11:30,"which would import English coal to the BASC region,"
00:11:30,00:11:31,and then the sons of the BASC bourgeoisie
00:11:31,00:11:33,"would go to England to be educated,"
00:11:33,00:11:36,"and that, James, is it true that there is a club"
00:11:36,00:11:39,called Athletic Club Bill Bale?
00:11:39,00:11:40,"Oh, yeah."
00:11:40,00:11:44,That was the biggest football teams in Spain.
00:11:44,00:11:45,There we go.
00:11:45,00:11:47,"I think that team is because of that link with the UK,"
00:11:47,00:11:49,"and with England, which had obviously, you know,"
00:11:49,00:11:51,where football was being developed.
00:11:51,00:11:52,Right.
00:11:52,00:11:53,I think it's Athletic Bill Bale.
00:11:53,00:11:55,It's one of them down there where they only
00:11:55,00:11:58,"have BASC footballers who play for them,"
00:11:58,00:12:00,"certainly until very recently,"
00:12:00,00:12:02,"that you had to live within,"
00:12:02,00:12:05,"or be born within 10 miles of the ground,"
00:12:05,00:12:06,otherwise you couldn't play for them.
00:12:06,00:12:08,Pretty sure that's right.
00:12:08,00:12:09,Nice.
00:12:09,00:12:12,"We used to get a lot of BASC iron from there,"
00:12:12,00:12:16,and they had the best iron in the world in the BASC country.
00:12:16,00:12:20,"In Hamlet, there is a line which is the mutinies"
00:12:20,00:12:23,"in the Bilbo's, and they're referring to the shackles."
00:12:23,00:12:26,The Bilbo's are the shackles that prisoners are using
00:12:26,00:12:27,when they're in a boat.
00:12:27,00:12:31,"And that word Bilbo comes from the city of Bilbao,"
00:12:31,00:12:34,which is one of the biggest cities in the BASC region.
00:12:34,00:12:37,And actually also is where Bilbo Baggins gets his name.
00:12:37,00:12:38,Yeah.
00:12:38,00:12:39,Interesting.
00:12:39,00:12:42,"Yeah, named after Bilbao, because,"
00:12:42,00:12:45,"and that I think that talking got it from Shakespeare,"
00:12:45,00:12:46,it Shakespeare got it from the city.
00:12:46,00:12:47,Right.
00:12:47,00:12:48,That's terrific.
00:12:48,00:12:50,Bilbo Baggins.
00:12:50,00:12:51,Yeah.
00:12:51,00:12:53,"He's kind of, he's a bit cooler, isn't he?"
00:12:53,00:12:54,Yeah.
00:12:54,00:12:55,Bilbo Baggins.
00:12:55,00:12:56,He's staying up late.
00:12:56,00:12:58,He's having some delicious pintos.
00:12:58,00:13:00,It's got a sexy Spanish accent.
00:13:00,00:13:01,I like it.
00:13:01,00:13:02,I like him better.
00:13:02,00:13:06,Can I just tell you one more thing about a Canadian lake?
00:13:06,00:13:10,"There is a lake with an island in it,"
00:13:10,00:13:13,and the island in the lake is bigger than the lake.
00:13:13,00:13:16,"Oh, okay, I'm sorry."
00:13:16,00:13:19,Manacuaguan reservoir.
00:13:19,00:13:20,It's in Quebec.
00:13:20,00:13:22,"Just how can, how can that be?"
00:13:22,00:13:25,"So it's a ring, a quiet, a ring around."
00:13:25,00:13:26,"It's a ring around, basically."
00:13:26,00:13:28,An annular lake.
00:13:28,00:13:32,"So basically, it was created by a meteorite."
00:13:32,00:13:33,And then it was an upswell of land.
00:13:33,00:13:36,So it's like a circular island.
00:13:36,00:13:37,And then a circular lake.
00:13:37,00:13:40,But the lake is only just wider than the island.
00:13:40,00:13:43,So the water is just the ring around it.
00:13:43,00:13:44,"If that makes sense, very cool."
00:13:44,00:13:46,It's like a kid's water park.
00:13:46,00:13:47,Like a kid's water park.
00:13:47,00:13:49,But how's the island bigger than the--
00:13:49,00:13:51,Because the area of the lake is only
00:13:51,00:13:54,"the bit where the water is, which just goes around it."
00:13:54,00:13:56,"Oh, okay, okay."
00:13:56,00:13:58,I thought you were saying that the island had grown
00:13:58,00:14:02,like a mushroom and expanded beyond the lake.
00:14:02,00:14:04,"Well, the other thing is that--"
00:14:04,00:14:05,"no, I didn't say that."
00:14:05,00:14:06,But the other thing is that there's
00:14:06,00:14:08,a little mountain on it.
00:14:08,00:14:11,"So the surface area of the island would be more as well,"
00:14:11,00:14:13,because it goes upwards as well as flowers.
00:14:13,00:14:14,"Oh, that's very cool."
00:14:14,00:14:15,"Anyway, that's just a thing."
00:14:15,00:14:17,"That's-- I mean, that's where the water slide would go."
00:14:17,00:14:20,"Top of the mountain, slide into the circular--"
00:14:20,00:14:22,"The rubber ring, the laser ribber."
00:14:22,00:14:24,"The rubber ring, the laser ribber, thank you."
00:14:24,00:14:27,"Baseball players also love sunflower seeds, apparently,"
00:14:27,00:14:29,in the USA.
00:14:29,00:14:32,To such an extent that Major League Baseball
00:14:32,00:14:36,"had to ban sunflower seed eating during 2020, why--"
00:14:36,00:14:37,COVID.
00:14:37,00:14:40,COVID.
00:14:40,00:14:42,I need the answer to any question where
00:14:42,00:14:46,the word 2020 is in there.
00:14:46,00:14:47,"James, next time I'd appreciate a bit more"
00:14:47,00:14:48,having it all.
00:14:48,00:14:52,"Oh, the littler."
00:14:52,00:14:57,Was it something to do with the first six weeks of 2020?
00:14:57,00:14:59,It's because players were spitting.
00:14:59,00:15:01,"When they true, then they spit."
00:15:01,00:15:02,And that was cracked down on.
00:15:02,00:15:04,"And they said, we can't trust you to eat sunflower seeds"
00:15:04,00:15:05,in not spit.
00:15:05,00:15:07,They also banned after-game showers.
00:15:07,00:15:10,"I presume for the same reason, because they spit in them."
00:15:10,00:15:13,"No, I don't-- sorry."
00:15:13,00:15:14,"To COVID, I guess."
00:15:14,00:15:16,To sexy.
00:15:16,00:15:17,To sexy?
00:15:17,00:15:19,"I don't think that was the worry, wasn't it?"
00:15:19,00:15:21,A communal after-game showers?
00:15:21,00:15:23,I think you were allowed to have a shower by yourself.
00:15:23,00:15:25,I don't know.
00:15:25,00:15:26,It wasn't too sexy.
00:15:26,00:15:28,It wasn't like they couldn't help snobby each other
00:15:28,00:15:29,as soon as they got in.
00:15:29,00:15:32,I don't know what you think happens after a spotting event.
00:15:32,00:15:34,I have never been close enough to a sporting event
00:15:34,00:15:35,to find out.
00:15:35,00:15:37,"Is that as soon as the final whistle goes, everyone's"
00:15:37,00:15:40,kids are-- I'm making it up.
00:15:40,00:15:43,"Oh, fuck, everyone."
00:15:43,00:15:46,"Dylan Thomas and his wife, Caitlin,"
00:15:46,00:15:47,had an open relationship.
00:15:47,00:15:49,"So they were sleeping left, right in the centre."
00:15:49,00:15:50,They had three kids together and Caitlin--
00:15:50,00:15:51,"With other people, right?"
00:15:51,00:15:54,"Yeah, I'm just sleeping with friends."
00:15:54,00:15:56,But I quite like the idea of an open relationship
00:15:56,00:15:58,if it means you get to sleep a lot.
00:15:58,00:15:58,Maybe.
00:15:58,00:16:00,That sounds lovely.
00:16:00,00:16:00,Yeah.
00:16:00,00:16:02,Going around with a mattress strap to your back.
00:16:02,00:16:04,This is just for maps.
00:16:04,00:16:05,It was a definitely open.
00:16:05,00:16:07,I thought they always got pissed off
00:16:07,00:16:09,with each other when the other one had affairs.
00:16:09,00:16:10,I think he did a lot of womanizing.
00:16:10,00:16:11,He did shudders of womanizing.
00:16:11,00:16:13,I don't know how much she did.
00:16:13,00:16:13,She did a bunch.
00:16:13,00:16:15,She said it was a miracle that her three kids
00:16:15,00:16:19,were the children of Dylan because it was touch and go.
00:16:19,00:16:21,But I think it wasn't an open relationship.
00:16:21,00:16:22,"If you're only touching it, then going"
00:16:22,00:16:24,is not going to be the other guy's kids.
00:16:24,00:16:25,"Santa, how it works?"
00:16:25,00:16:26,That's what the phone said to you.
00:16:26,00:16:27,OK.
00:16:27,00:16:29,Do you remember those TV shows that used
00:16:29,00:16:32,to be on where you'd call up in the middle of the night?
00:16:32,00:16:34,And it would be a competition you entered and you'd
00:16:34,00:16:35,win a car or something.
00:16:35,00:16:36,"Well, you'd never win."
00:16:36,00:16:39,"Well, so there was one where there was this old man"
00:16:39,00:16:41,on the phone and he got through in there.
00:16:41,00:16:43,And it was always really easy quiz questions.
00:16:43,00:16:45,"And the question was like, you'll win a car"
00:16:45,00:16:46,if you aren't this.
00:16:46,00:16:50,Just tell me one word that starts with the word under.
00:16:50,00:16:55,"And this old man went, under milk word."
00:16:55,00:16:59,"Oh, he didn't win the car because it's not a word."
00:16:59,00:17:00,"No, it's not a word."
00:17:00,00:17:02,"All right, it's under pressure."
00:17:02,00:17:03,Yeah.
00:17:03,00:17:04,Also not a word.
00:17:04,00:17:06,What?
00:17:06,00:17:08,Call it number three.
00:17:08,00:17:11,[LAUGHTER]
00:17:11,00:17:14,"Singaporeans, long hair, a famous band."
00:17:14,00:17:17,Back when long hair was a symbol of resistance to the man.
00:17:17,00:17:18,What year?
00:17:18,00:17:20,"Yeah, so do you know when that roughly when it stopped?"
00:17:20,00:17:22,"Yeah, it was when it stopped."
00:17:22,00:17:22,Yeah.
00:17:22,00:17:23,I think it would have stopped in the early '80s.
00:17:23,00:17:24,OK.
00:17:24,00:17:25,"Yeah, it happened."
00:17:25,00:17:26,It stopped in the late '80s.
00:17:26,00:17:27,Was it late '80s?
00:17:27,00:17:30,Around the time of the war on piss?
00:17:30,00:17:30,"Oh, yeah."
00:17:30,00:17:32,"Maybe once they ended the band, they thought"
00:17:32,00:17:35,we freed up our judicial resources to wage war on left wing.
00:17:35,00:17:36,Yeah.
00:17:36,00:17:39,"Yeah, there was a Japanese guy called Kitaro"
00:17:39,00:17:43,who was forced to cancel a gig in 1984 because he was long hair.
00:17:43,00:17:44,Was he?
00:17:44,00:17:46,And the Beeju's famously out to--
00:17:46,00:17:47,they were given-- you could sometimes
00:17:47,00:17:49,"get a pass, a long hair pass."
00:17:49,00:17:51,"And I think one year, they came to do a gig,"
00:17:51,00:17:53,"and they got 48 hour pass, because basically,"
00:17:53,00:17:55,they didn't want Singapore and Singapore
00:17:55,00:17:56,didn't want its own people.
00:17:56,00:18:00,It just seems like after 46 hours someone's chasing you
00:18:00,00:18:03,"with some clippers, it looks like Cinderella."
00:18:03,00:18:05,[LAUGHTER]
00:18:05,00:18:09,They're running-- they're running to the gates of the airport.
00:18:09,00:18:11,That's wonderful airport.
00:18:11,00:18:13,"They're very followed by the scissors, man."
00:18:13,00:18:16,What was the result of them if they got busted?
00:18:16,00:18:17,"Like, how bad is the--"
00:18:17,00:18:19,That was-- I think you've got a large final.
00:18:19,00:18:21,You've got a forced to cut off your hair.
00:18:21,00:18:22,"Oh, OK."
00:18:22,00:18:23,It's not death sentence.
00:18:23,00:18:24,They're just running away.
00:18:24,00:18:26,Not staying alive.
00:18:26,00:18:27,Not staying alive.
00:18:27,00:18:30,"Yeah, I don't think death sentence for the Beeju's."
00:18:30,00:18:31,Right.
00:18:31,00:18:34,"But then the next year, they weren't given a pass."
00:18:34,00:18:36,So I think it might have all been employed.
00:18:36,00:18:38,There's a lot to stop the Beeju's coming back after.
00:18:38,00:18:40,They didn't like it the first time.
00:18:40,00:18:43,"There was, if you were ever needed the government for anything."
00:18:43,00:18:48,"So let's say you needed to get some social security,"
00:18:48,00:18:52,or you needed someone to help you with some building permit
00:18:52,00:18:53,"or something that would be signs that said,"
00:18:53,00:18:57,males with one hair will be attended to last.
00:18:57,00:18:59,So you just go to the back of the queue.
00:18:59,00:19:00,Ouch.
00:19:00,00:19:02,"Yeah, that is strange."
00:19:02,00:19:04,"And long hair, the definition of quite stringent,"
00:19:04,00:19:06,all the beetles would have failed.
00:19:06,00:19:07,It's like long hair is the definition
00:19:07,00:19:11,"is that if it covers your ears, or if it touches your eyebrows."
00:19:11,00:19:11,Interesting.
00:19:11,00:19:14,"So Dan, I think if you didn't juice up your hair,"
00:19:14,00:19:15,whatever it is you do with that front bit--
00:19:15,00:19:17,"I juice it up, yeah."
00:19:17,00:19:19,I think about my stretch to your eyebrows.
00:19:19,00:19:21,[LAUGHTER]
00:19:21,00:19:22,OK.
00:19:22,00:19:24,I wonder if that would trick them though.
00:19:24,00:19:26,"If you could, if you did juice it up into a quick"
00:19:26,00:19:27,as you went to security.
00:19:27,00:19:28,"Yeah, I don't think so."
00:19:28,00:19:29,I think they see through that.
00:19:29,00:19:31,Or maybe a cool horn.
00:19:31,00:19:32,"Yeah, yeah."
00:19:32,00:19:33,"I mean, it is."
00:19:33,00:19:34,How interesting.
00:19:34,00:19:37,"If you weigh in a public toilet in Singapore,"
00:19:37,00:19:40,you are legally required to flush.
00:19:40,00:19:40,Really?
00:19:40,00:19:41,OK.
00:19:41,00:19:42,Like still to this day.
00:19:42,00:19:43,I believe so.
00:19:43,00:19:44,"Yeah, right."
00:19:44,00:19:45,It is in the rule.
00:19:45,00:19:46,I saw that.
00:19:46,00:19:51,"And the fine from first fence is up to 1,000 pounds."
00:19:51,00:19:55,"But there is a further thing that says that it is $5,000"
00:19:55,00:19:58,for every day or part thereof during which
00:19:58,00:20:01,the fence continues after conviction.
00:20:01,00:20:04,"So in theory, if you go for a wee and you don't flush,"
00:20:04,00:20:08,"and then no one else uses that toilet for like three weeks,"
00:20:08,00:20:11,you'd have to pay $500 for each time in theory.
00:20:11,00:20:15,"Do they rope it off and say, you have to be the one"
00:20:15,00:20:17,to go back to doing it?
00:20:17,00:20:19,"In actual fact, that bit of the law"
00:20:19,00:20:21,is due to another part of the--
00:20:21,00:20:23,it's a public sanitation law.
00:20:23,00:20:26,And that part is referring really to something else.
00:20:26,00:20:29,It's like people digging up pipes when they shouldn't be.
00:20:29,00:20:33,"But technically, according to law, if you don't flush,"
00:20:33,00:20:35,"and no one flushes it for a year,"
00:20:35,00:20:40,"you'd have to pay $180,000."
00:20:40,00:20:42,"And all their exemptions, if it's the middle of the night,"
00:20:42,00:20:45,and you didn't want to wake anyone up.
00:20:45,00:20:46,I think that's fine.
00:20:46,00:20:47,I think that's fine.
00:20:47,00:20:50,Did you hear about the experimental lakes area in Canada?
00:20:50,00:20:51,I loved this.
00:20:51,00:20:51,No.
00:20:51,00:20:52,Canada has so many lakes.
00:20:52,00:20:56,"They have set aside 58 in Ontario alone, specifically"
00:20:56,00:20:58,for scientific research.
00:20:58,00:21:03,And they've spent 50 years studying these 58 lakes.
00:21:03,00:21:05,"And it's like a scientific playground, basically."
00:21:05,00:21:09,So they study acid rain and they study algae blooms.
00:21:09,00:21:14,"And in 2018, they spilled 90 gallons of oil"
00:21:14,00:21:16,into one of the lakes on purpose.
00:21:16,00:21:17,"Because when you have an oil spill,"
00:21:17,00:21:19,normally people just rush there with cotton buds
00:21:19,00:21:22,and clean up the birds and clean up the oil all of that.
00:21:22,00:21:24,They were trying to work out how it moves.
00:21:24,00:21:26,How do you deal with it?
00:21:26,00:21:27,That kind of thing.
00:21:27,00:21:29,Like maybe it just starts itself out.
00:21:29,00:21:30,Maybe it just starts itself.
00:21:30,00:21:31,And that's what they found.
00:21:31,00:21:33,We've been wasting our time cleaning it up.
00:21:33,00:21:36,"Or Eastrogen going into the water, like synthetic Eastrogen"
00:21:36,00:21:39,in sort of medicines and things like that.
00:21:39,00:21:40,What does that do to fish?
00:21:40,00:21:41,Yes.
00:21:41,00:21:43,Because it changes the sex of loads of fish and all of this.
00:21:43,00:21:45,So they're like crash test dummy lakes
00:21:45,00:21:47,that have massively improved water quality
00:21:47,00:21:48,across the whole planet.
00:21:48,00:21:49,Interesting.
00:21:49,00:21:51,Because the results can be found
00:21:51,00:21:53,"and, you know, quite across the world."
00:21:53,00:21:54,It's really cool.
00:21:54,00:21:56,"Well, there's also this lake, which is super scientifically"
00:21:56,00:21:58,important because it seems to represent
00:21:58,00:22:01,how humans have messed up the world.
00:22:01,00:22:03,This is also in Canada.
00:22:03,00:22:05,And this is so--
00:22:05,00:22:07,this is called Crawford Lake.
00:22:07,00:22:09,"It's 24 meters deep, but it's quite small."
00:22:09,00:22:11,And this is when-- there's this big debate
00:22:11,00:22:14,about whether we're in the Anthropocene area yet.
00:22:14,00:22:17,And so the holocene has been a few thousand years.
00:22:17,00:22:19,And then the Anthropocene is defined as the epoch
00:22:19,00:22:22,where humans are having the biggest effect on the environment.
00:22:22,00:22:25,And every new era-- I didn't know this--
00:22:25,00:22:27,"every new era has to have a location,"
00:22:27,00:22:28,a place that represents it.
00:22:28,00:22:32,"And it was decided this tiny little lake in Ontario, Crawford Lake,"
00:22:32,00:22:36,"represented it because it's so deep, but so small,"
00:22:36,00:22:39,that the bottom waters don't mix with the top waters.
00:22:39,00:22:42,So all the sediment that's been laid down on it over the years
00:22:42,00:22:43,doesn't get messed around.
00:22:43,00:22:45,"So if you take a big bit of segment,"
00:22:45,00:22:47,"a big cross section of sediment, look on it."
00:22:47,00:22:49,You can see the mark of humans.
00:22:49,00:22:51,So the first nuclear test immediately
00:22:51,00:22:53,appears in your study of the sediment
00:22:53,00:22:55,when fossil fuels started to be increased in use.
00:22:55,00:22:57,That immediately appears in the sediment.
00:22:57,00:22:59,So there's a big thing.
00:22:59,00:23:01,Is Crawford Lake the start of the new epoch?
00:23:01,00:23:03,"And they've decided that no, it's not."
00:23:03,00:23:04,Right.
00:23:04,00:23:07,So they've decided we're not in the Anthropocene area.
00:23:07,00:23:08,We're not in the Anthropocene area.
00:23:08,00:23:09,"If we were, it would be Crawford Lake."
00:23:09,00:23:12,But I feel like if they went for another lake
00:23:12,00:23:14,"that wasn't in the middle of nowhere,"
00:23:14,00:23:17,they might have worked out that actually we are in it.
00:23:17,00:23:18,Or we would have got more press at least.
00:23:18,00:23:22,"Yeah, if they had gone to like the Aral Sea or something."
00:23:22,00:23:24,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:23:24,00:23:26,"Or somewhere where, you know,"
00:23:26,00:23:29,it's all dried up or there's just radiation there or something.
00:23:29,00:23:32,They're really strict about the definition of a new epoch.
00:23:32,00:23:33,"Yeah, yes, yes."
00:23:33,00:23:35,"Yeah, it's a big deal, isn't it?"
00:23:35,00:23:36,Exactly.
00:23:36,00:23:37,You can't just go naming them Willie Nile.
00:23:37,00:23:40,Does feel like we're there though.
00:23:40,00:23:43,"Oh, one of us, one of us around this table,"
00:23:43,00:23:45,will have had it more.
00:23:45,00:23:50,I'm afraid not James that's it back down.
00:23:50,00:23:54,"Sorry, they experienced parodolia more parodolia."
00:23:54,00:23:56,And can we guess it based on knowledge of each other?
00:23:56,00:23:57,Absolutely.
00:23:57,00:24:01,"It's got to be Ibeth, golfer's idiots or women."
00:24:01,00:24:04,Does feel like that.
00:24:04,00:24:06,"Maybe, maybe."
00:24:06,00:24:07,James has ruled out.
00:24:07,00:24:11,"Well, James have it less because of his affentasia thing."
00:24:11,00:24:12,Face blindness.
00:24:12,00:24:14,"Yeah, I don't know whether that means James has it less."
00:24:14,00:24:17,"I mean, he's all the devil of that pachora one time."
00:24:17,00:24:18,So I think he's got it.
00:24:18,00:24:19,OK.
00:24:19,00:24:21,I'll try and find the picture of that pachora
00:24:21,00:24:22,and put it on my Instagram.
00:24:22,00:24:23,I think I can do it.
00:24:23,00:24:25,Is it me because I wear glasses?
00:24:25,00:24:28,"And the lenses might give me little, little different"
00:24:28,00:24:29,remiserizing.
00:24:29,00:24:31,"No, it's not."
00:24:31,00:24:32,So let's-- can we please wrap this up?
00:24:32,00:24:33,"Yes, all right."
00:24:33,00:24:36,It's got to be within why it's not just women.
00:24:36,00:24:40,Is it people who eat sushi on the train?
00:24:40,00:24:41,You'd normally see the back of people's heads
00:24:41,00:24:45,as they walk away along the carriage from you.
00:24:45,00:24:48,"No, it's mums."
00:24:48,00:24:52,It's mums-- this is a study in biology letters.
00:24:52,00:24:55,"Scientists showed 380 women, a collection of images."
00:24:55,00:24:58,And the women who had given birth in the last year
00:24:58,00:25:02,were likely to see faces and to perceive more face-like images
00:25:02,00:25:04,in what they saw.
00:25:04,00:25:07,And it might be due to more oxytocin.
00:25:07,00:25:07,We don't know.
00:25:07,00:25:10,"But it might be sort of primitive, nurturing instincts."
00:25:10,00:25:11,Oxytocin.
00:25:11,00:25:12,I know.
00:25:12,00:25:14,"So on my feet hurt, yeah, it's oxytocin."
00:25:14,00:25:15,"Oxytocin, yeah, yeah."
00:25:15,00:25:17,"But babies have it, too."
00:25:17,00:25:19,So babies will spend longer looking at collections of dots
00:25:19,00:25:21,and dashes that look a bit like a face than random dots
00:25:21,00:25:24,"and dashes, even after a few minutes of life."
00:25:24,00:25:26,So it's a really deep program thing.
00:25:26,00:25:27,There's face-finding stuff like that.
00:25:27,00:25:31,"Even before life, depending on when you think life starts,"
00:25:31,00:25:34,"a book from time to time, this would be so easy."
00:25:34,00:25:35,I don't want the inbox.
00:25:35,00:25:37,"We have-- the inbox is a busy place, honey."
00:25:37,00:25:40,I'm so sorry.
00:25:40,00:25:42,"But even before they're born, babies have it,"
00:25:42,00:25:45,"which I find extraordinary, because they've never seen a face."
00:25:45,00:25:47,But they did an experiment a few years ago
00:25:47,00:25:52,"where they shone a triangle of three lights, three lit dots"
00:25:52,00:25:55,"at a woman's uterus, basically, through her skin."
00:25:55,00:25:57,And they monitored what the fetus was doing inside.
00:25:57,00:25:59,And if the triangle has the two dots on the top
00:25:59,00:26:02,"and the one dot on the bottom, then the fetus would move around"
00:26:02,00:26:05,and crane its head towards it to look at it.
00:26:05,00:26:07,But if it had the two dots on the bottom and the one
00:26:07,00:26:10,"dot at the top, so it oriented not like a face,"
00:26:10,00:26:11,the fetus wouldn't care.
00:26:11,00:26:12,Wow.
00:26:12,00:26:14,And it's never seen a face.
00:26:14,00:26:16,That's what's going on there.
00:26:16,00:26:18,And I've got a mirror in there.
00:26:18,00:26:19,What is going on there?
00:26:19,00:26:21,"Do they have to put it upside down,"
00:26:21,00:26:23,because babies are sometimes upside down in the womb?
00:26:23,00:26:23,That's a really good point.
00:26:23,00:26:25,"They must have, wasn't they?"
00:26:25,00:26:25,Yeah.
00:26:25,00:26:27,"Otherwise, the experiment is a complete wash."
00:26:27,00:26:32,"Oh my god, Andy, you should write to them, check."
00:26:32,00:26:36,"A lot of people seem to leave bomb threats on sick bags,"
00:26:36,00:26:40,which seems quite an annoying thing to do.
00:26:40,00:26:43,"And over the years, there are constant articles of--"
00:26:43,00:26:46,"someone is misspelled, so I think in 2017,"
00:26:46,00:26:48,there was a fight from Sydney that had to be completely
00:26:48,00:26:53,"evacuated, because a bag said B-O-M, which doesn't--"
00:26:53,00:26:55,I don't know if you just seem they even meant bomb.
00:26:55,00:26:56,There was another one that was found--
00:26:56,00:26:59,"Wait, was that not the one where they were going to Bombay?"
00:26:59,00:27:01,I'm sure there was one that happened once.
00:27:01,00:27:02,Right.
00:27:02,00:27:05,"They wrote sort of like N-A-N to B-O-M,"
00:27:05,00:27:07,because it was Manchester to Mumbai.
00:27:07,00:27:09,And they saw the bomb and they thought it was a bomb.
00:27:09,00:27:10,That's really funny.
00:27:10,00:27:13,"I think these guys were going to not Bombay,"
00:27:13,00:27:14,but I can imagine that would have happened.
00:27:14,00:27:15,Can I check?
00:27:15,00:27:19,Is this people who are getting off a plane
00:27:19,00:27:21,and are playing a kind of sick prank as they leave?
00:27:21,00:27:22,They just write the word bomb on the sick bag
00:27:22,00:27:23,and then they get off?
00:27:23,00:27:24,"We think so, yes."
00:27:24,00:27:26,Which I thought the clean is a better job than that.
00:27:26,00:27:27,"But yes, it is."
00:27:27,00:27:30,Because there was another one that was found just after a flight
00:27:30,00:27:32,"had taken off from Sydney in 2004,"
00:27:32,00:27:35,"and someone found a sick bag in the toilet that said,"
00:27:35,00:27:39,"Bob, which I just think is someone naming their bag."
00:27:39,00:27:41,"Well, yeah, it's two dyslexic people"
00:27:41,00:27:44,"because both have spelt bomb wrong in both case, right?"
00:27:44,00:27:45,"Well, yeah."
00:27:45,00:27:47,Once missing the M and the others missing the...
00:27:47,00:27:48,"Yep, I mean, yes."
00:27:48,00:27:50,"But I mean, it could be that they weren't even trying to spell Bob."
00:27:50,00:27:52,"In fact, so they were playing out to turn around"
00:27:52,00:27:53,and had to be completely evacuated.
00:27:53,00:27:54,The sound of the bomb on a bag.
00:27:54,00:27:55,The sound of the bomb on a bag.
00:27:55,00:27:57,The sound of the bomb on a bag.
00:27:57,00:27:58,I don't know.
00:27:58,00:28:01,"I know, it does seem over gorgeous, doesn't it?"
00:28:01,00:28:03,And the stewards and stewards have said afterwards
00:28:03,00:28:04,"that, actually, apparently,"
00:28:04,00:28:06,they commonly use the letters B-O-B
00:28:06,00:28:08,anyway as slang for best on board.
00:28:08,00:28:11,"Meaning, fitty in the, in a mile, seven."
00:28:11,00:28:12,Oh!
00:28:12,00:28:14,"So, actually, it could have just been a stewardess, right?"
00:28:14,00:28:17,It could have always called me Bob on the plates.
00:28:17,00:28:18,"Yeah, that's why."
00:28:18,00:28:20,That's why I'm the fittest one on the plane.
00:28:20,00:28:21,Yeah.
00:28:21,00:28:22,But you also chart your own flights everywhere
00:28:22,00:28:24,and you're at the early passenger.
00:28:24,00:28:25,Isn't that a helicopter flight?
00:28:25,00:28:26,Do you want it?
00:28:26,00:28:27,It's just you two.
00:28:27,00:28:31,Do you know there's a really cool thing
00:28:31,00:28:33,that you can see online called LightningMap.org
00:28:33,00:28:36,and it shows you where basically every Lightning strike
00:28:36,00:28:37,is happening live on our planet right now.
00:28:37,00:28:40,Where's that closest Lightning storm?
00:28:40,00:28:42,That's actually got the app open right now.
00:28:42,00:28:43,The closest to us.
00:28:43,00:28:44,"Yeah, yeah."
00:28:44,00:28:46,Let me make my way back to...
00:28:46,00:28:46,"No, no."
00:28:46,00:28:48,"If Panama's there, we're in the other direction."
00:28:48,00:28:49,"Yeah, yeah."
00:28:49,00:28:50,"I was, I was, I was, I was, I was, I was going the wrong way."
00:28:50,00:28:52,"I was going, I was going, yeah."
00:28:52,00:28:54,(laughing)
00:28:54,00:28:57,"Don't, don't police."
00:28:57,00:28:59,"You're not rude, Dan thinks it's the best"
00:28:59,00:29:00,to get from Panama to the UK.
00:29:00,00:29:01,"Yeah, man."
00:29:01,00:29:03,We're gonna fall off the end of the flat earth dream
00:29:03,00:29:04,'cause right around me.
00:29:04,00:29:05,"Now, that's South Africa."
00:29:05,00:29:07,"I'm trying to, because I'm trying to bring,"
00:29:07,00:29:10,"I'm trying to do this, the pinchy thing together, dude."
00:29:10,00:29:10,Come on.
00:29:10,00:29:12,"Come on, let's miss down, let's miss down."
00:29:12,00:29:14,"Come on, let's miss down, not having you onboard, mate."
00:29:14,00:29:16,(laughing)
00:29:16,00:29:17,"All right, here we go."
00:29:17,00:29:18,"Okay, we got it, we got it."
00:29:18,00:29:19,Here we go.
00:29:19,00:29:20,Okay.
00:29:20,00:29:22,"This is absolutely captivated, God, yeah."
00:29:22,00:29:28,"I can see some in, it's all in a different language."
00:29:28,00:29:30,That's in Albania.
00:29:30,00:29:31,"Oh, please."
00:29:31,00:29:33,"All right, look out, if you're listening in Albania"
00:29:33,00:29:37,"to us live as this is going out, then watch out."
00:29:37,00:29:38,As South of Tarana.
00:29:38,00:29:39,"Oh, really?"
00:29:39,00:29:41,"So if you're in the North, you're cool."
00:29:41,00:29:43,"Okay, apparently we get 40 strikes every second,"
00:29:43,00:29:48,"so more than 3 million lightning strikes per day on Earth,"
00:29:48,00:29:49,which is huge.
00:29:49,00:29:51,There's a lot.
00:29:51,00:29:52,The worst sick bag of all time.
00:29:52,00:29:56,This is according to expert Danny Cahillung from Sydney.
00:29:56,00:29:58,"He's another bag, I believe."
00:29:58,00:30:00,He said the worst ever design was the 1970s.
00:30:00,00:30:02,It's called the Six Sack.
00:30:02,00:30:05,"And the problem is it's in an envelope itself,"
00:30:05,00:30:06,which makes it quite fiddly.
00:30:06,00:30:09,"Like you're fiddling, you're getting a bag out of an envelope,"
00:30:09,00:30:11,"you're opening it, you know, it's often a quite"
00:30:11,00:30:12,full time pressurised situation
00:30:12,00:30:14,that you're throwing up on a flight.
00:30:14,00:30:15,"Yeah, you don't want to be opening it."
00:30:15,00:30:18,"You don't want to have to get your letter open, or I'll do you."
00:30:18,00:30:21,"In 1928, they tried anti-air sickness fumes"
00:30:21,00:30:23,throughout aeroplanes.
00:30:23,00:30:23,Interesting.
00:30:23,00:30:27,And that was a mixture of oxygen and cinnamon smell.
00:30:27,00:30:28,"Oh, lovely."
00:30:28,00:30:30,And hopefully not tock a bean.
00:30:30,00:30:32,But they would send it through the plane.
00:30:32,00:30:35,And the idea was it would stop people from feeling sick.
00:30:35,00:30:36,Really?
00:30:36,00:30:37,Did it work?
00:30:37,00:30:38,"Well, we don't have it today."
00:30:38,00:30:40,"I don't think so, really."
00:30:40,00:30:41,"I think really in those days, people"
00:30:41,00:30:44,didn't really know what caused it.
00:30:44,00:30:46,There was an article by some fund
00:30:46,00:30:47,"called the Guggenheim Fund, who claimed"
00:30:47,00:30:50,that it was a psychological state.
00:30:50,00:30:52,"So as in, it was just all in your head."
00:30:52,00:30:56,And it could be cured by an increasing confidence in flyers.
00:30:56,00:30:58,Maybe I think I sort of buy that.
00:30:58,00:30:59,Do you?
00:30:59,00:31:00,No.
00:31:00,00:31:01,The problem sickness is real.
00:31:01,00:31:03,"Definitely it is, but I just think if I'm nervous,"
00:31:03,00:31:05,I'm likely to throw up on any given day.
00:31:05,00:31:06,That's fair enough.
00:31:06,00:31:08,It's not even before the forecast.
00:31:08,00:31:10,Every week.
00:31:10,00:31:12,Grandmaster Flash collects mugs.
00:31:12,00:31:13,"OK, yeah."
00:31:13,00:31:16,"He's got 5,000, he says, in a special room."
00:31:16,00:31:18,"And he says, the room temperature is correct."
00:31:18,00:31:19,What?
00:31:19,00:31:21,"That's just room temperature, isn't it?"
00:31:21,00:31:27,Mugs don't have an incredibly narrow range of temperatures
00:31:27,00:31:28,they can perform in.
00:31:28,00:31:34,A whole point of a mug is that they can go to a hundred degrees.
00:31:34,00:31:38,"But at least we know it's not like minus 200 degrees,"
00:31:38,00:31:39,"or plus by 1,000 degrees."
00:31:39,00:31:42,He keeps it very carefully between minus 200
00:31:42,00:31:45,"and plus by 1,000 degrees at that room."
00:31:45,00:31:47,His room sells with absolutely so I'm coming.
00:31:47,00:31:58,"OK, that's it."
00:31:58,00:32:00,That is all of our outtakes.
00:32:00,00:32:01,"Thanks, everyone."
00:32:01,00:32:03,If you want to write into us about anything
00:32:03,00:32:06,"that we've said during the course of this compilation,"
00:32:06,00:32:11,"why not drop us a line, send an email to podcast@qy.com."
00:32:11,00:32:13,Andy will read these emails.
00:32:13,00:32:15,And he likes to cherry pick the best of them
00:32:15,00:32:17,and bring them to our mail bag episode
00:32:17,00:32:19,that we do as part of Club Fish.
