00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,160
 Hey Clubfish members, it is Dan here. Welcome to your bonus compilation episode.

2
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:15,840
 This is all of the outtakes, all of the bloopers, the tangents, basically all the bits that

3
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:20,140
 didn't fit into the main narrative of the episodes. But stuff that we didn't want to get rid

4
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:24,560
 of and so we've brought it all together here in one handy compilation. But before we

5
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:28,920
 get into it, I just want to remind anyone who hasn't seen the news. We're doing a couple

6
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:33,620
 of live shows very soon. We are going to be playing the London podcast festival. And the

7
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:38,320
 fun thing about this is usually it's just a gig and I believe the two gigs are actually

8
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:41,780
 sold out if you want to be there physically. However, we're going to be live streaming

9
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:45,520
 the gigs. Now in the past, I know this has been really fun because as you're watching the

10
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:49,840
 live stream, you can actually comment underneath as the show is going along. It's a really

11
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:54,840
 cool way of meeting fellow fish listeners if you've not done that before. So why not check

12
00:00:54,840 --> 00:01:00,520
 it out. The link is on our website. We're doing the fifth and sixth of September. We've partially

13
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:05,280
 announced the guest who's going to be joining us on the sixth and that is Richard Osman.

14
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:09,280
 So that's going to be really awesome. We'll be announcing our other guest very soon for

15
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:14,320
 the fifth. But as I say, tickets are available. You can watch it as it's happening live on

16
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:18,920
 stage. So we've also got another live show announcement coming up. We'll be announcing

17
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:22,640
 at the top of this week's show. So keep a listen out for that in case it happens to be

18
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:27,280
 in a town near you. And that's it for the admin. So let's get on with it. This is a big

19
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:30,800
 old chunky compilation episode. Here we go.

20
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:53,080
 Yeah, you mentioned Braveheart in this time and the Battle of Sterling Bridge happened

21
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:57,560
 then. I like this from Wikipedia. The Battle of Sterling Bridge is depicted in the 1995

22
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:02,800
 film Braveheart, but it bears little resemblance to the real battle. Most egregiously, there

23
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:10,600
 being no bridge. But that is the time when supposedly the Scots lifted their kilts and

24
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:15,960
 showed their bums. It's interesting to show it to scare the English, but we have no evidence

25
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:20,760
 to that happen. There's no contemporary evidence to that happen. But we do have a 40th century

26
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:25,360
 account of the English doing that against the Scottish jury in those wars.

27
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:30,320
 Dropping their trousers. Yeah, really? In the Chronicle of Peter Langtoft, they mentioned

28
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:35,160
 the English doing that. No way. And did it what did scare the Scots? Or did it make them

29
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:39,200
 think, oh, open target? I think we haven't seen before, you know? We've all got them,

30
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:46,280
 you know? Why are they, why are they triangular? Giants? Yeah. You know how they've got the

31
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:49,760
 point at the front? Yeah. They're shaped like a boat, basically. Yes, yeah. I think to carve

32
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:53,640
 a route through the close, much like a boat through the water. Probably for a shape,

33
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:58,520
 the opposite. It would be harder to do the ironing. I think so. Why don't you try doing

34
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:03,120
 it backwards next time? That's a really good idea. That's a really good idea. And why is

35
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:09,760
 the shape lined up with my shirt on back to the front? You're not there. My head's on your

36
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:16,840
 head. I'd be frantically searching for the why. We used to have double pointed back to

37
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:21,760
 front reversible ones, which would save you having the whole trousers on your head, Palava.

38
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:28,680
 I would see like a sort of, like a leaf, I suppose. Like a canoe. Or a canoe. Yes. And keep

39
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:34,360
 the boat analogy going. Yeah. Which we should do throughout. And these were the most popular

40
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:40,640
 iron from about 1870 to the 1930s, 40s when electric irons came in. And they were invented

41
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:46,240
 by this woman called Mary Pots. So she basically invented the iron that people were using in

42
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:51,400
 the late 19th, early 20th century. And she got lots of patterns for it. So she made it hollow.

43
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:56,480
 So it wasn't as heavy. And it also didn't get so dangerously hot because she filled the

44
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:00,600
 inside with wool or something non-heat conducting. Because people were constantly burning their

45
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:06,000
 hands. And she invented the removable handle. So you could constantly have, you could be

46
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,080
 heating up one iron while you were using the other. And then you could swap the iron onto

47
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:14,680
 the handle. That's really Palava. Why can't they both just have a handle? Sorry, I mean,

48
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:19,040
 where's the handle would probably heat up, right? Get super hot. Yeah. Yeah. It's like

49
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:24,160
 when you cook an egg, sometimes that handle got like go. I don't hold onto the pan all

50
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:29,280
 the way through the cooking process. You've got to rip the rim of the pan with both hands

51
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:40,360
 ideally. As the saying goes, a held part always boils. John Harvey Kellogg. Okay. Cornflakes

52
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:46,560
 pioneer and anti-fiddling around with yourself. Yep. Advocate. Go back to early episodes to see

53
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:53,120
 what the hell that's referring to. Yes. We won't tell you which one. We answer all 580.

54
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:59,000
 I believe he invented an early sunbed. He believed it could cure almost everything. And there

55
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,800
 was a big thing of sun therapy where high altitude sunbathing in particular, because it gave

56
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:08,560
 you supposedly more unfiltered ultraviolet rays, which was especially good for you at the

57
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:13,960
 time, as we now know is not the case. It's weird because there were some truths to this

58
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:18,640
 idea at the time. I guess Kellogg thought that it filled your skin with blood, which drew

59
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:23,880
 blood away from your diseased organs, which wasn't correct. But the seventh did, in fact,

60
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:29,080
 install one of his sun baths in the palace in 1903, where you sat in a chair, which was

61
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:33,800
 fully enclosed, and it had 52 light bulbs around you that could glow any colour for different

62
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:38,000
 health benefits. Right. But at the same time that one of the first Nobel Prizes was awarded

63
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:45,680
 for discovering the benefits of light therapy on tuberculosis and TB. Yeah, exactly. Which

64
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:51,040
 was basically true, Neil's finson. Yeah. And then the open lots of salaria, didn't they

65
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:55,240
 all over Europe, which were basically for patients who were sick with stuff where you

66
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:59,560
 had these amazing sunning hospitals, which the NHS would never fund today. But where you

67
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:03,120
 could lie in this room, and the entire roof would retract on a sunny day, so you could be

68
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:07,320
 exposed to the sun, or giant balconies where your whole big bed would be wheeled out

69
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:11,720
 onto them. Yeah. And that was, was good for you. Yeah. But I don't know about the Kellogg

70
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:18,720
 - No, it doesn't cure gout and constipation like Kellogg claimed.

71
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:29,720
 - If you go to the beach and you get a suntan, then it's mostly due to the sun.

72
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:30,720
 - Carry on professor.

73
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:35,720
 - However, not point, not, not, not, not, not, not, not, not,

74
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:39,720
 1% of the radiation comes from stars beyond the galaxy.

75
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,720
 - Oh, that's great.

76
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:47,720
 - Because it's photons coming from, you know, from outer outer space that come onto our earth.

77
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:52,720
 And a certain amount of those photons will go into your body and they will cause your body to sound.

78
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:53,720
 - That's so cool.

79
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:56,720
 - If you get a night suntan, and how, I suppose it would take too long.

80
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:00,720
 - I think it would take too long given the number of zeros in that number.

81
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:04,720
 - So with that photon, that's travelled billions of miles across the universe.

82
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:05,720
 Is that the endpoint?

83
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:07,720
 - Your absorbs into your body.

84
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:10,720
 - For the endpoint for this, so ton of lights, that is travelled.

85
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,720
 - Is that true? Is that what it would be?

86
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,720
 - Yeah, it would itself into your body.

87
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:18,720
 - Wow, I read a thing as well that not only do we get that not point, not, not whatever it is,

88
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:24,720
 percentage of our suntan from the stars beyond our sun, but also from the leftover of the big bang.

89
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:25,720
 - Yeah, that's plausible.

90
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:28,720
 - Tarn of the big bang, a bang tan.

91
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:29,720
 Cool.

92
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:30,720
 - That's pretty well.

93
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:31,720
 - That's awesome.

94
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:32,720
 - Really good.

95
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,720
 - There's another one.

96
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:36,720
 This one definitely has some kind of meaning to it.

97
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:42,720
 So in Melanesian legend, they had two gods called Tagaro and Sukumatuwa.

98
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:45,720
 And they shared the work of creation.

99
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:49,720
 But whenever Tagaro did something, he did it well.

100
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:52,720
 And Sukumatuwa did it really badly.

101
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:56,720
 And so when they made trees, Tagaro made really nice food.

102
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:02,720
 And Sukumatuwa was really bitter, and stuff like that.

103
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:06,720
 Sukumatuwa wanted to have men sleep in the trunks of sego palms.

104
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:11,720
 But Tagaro thought, no, they should live in houses instead and stuff like that.

105
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:17,720
 And when they created men, Tagaro said that humans should have anuses.

106
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:21,720
 But Sukumatuwa said, no, they definitely shouldn't have anuses.

107
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:27,720
 And as a result, the ones that he made swelled up and burst because they could not defecate.

108
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:33,720
 - Again, it's the meaning. Do the job properly? Do you work?

109
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:36,720
 - I think it's like literally half of it.

110
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:39,720
 - It's like the, don't zero ask it.

111
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,720
 It's like the Yin and the Yang, right?

112
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:44,720
 It's like you always have to have the, not good and evil in this case,

113
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:48,720
 but sort of good and not very good.

114
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:49,720
 - Right, right, right.

115
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:50,720
 And it's, yeah, yeah.

116
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:51,720
 I think we've just invented a new phrase.

117
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:54,720
 I think we could just say, you've no asked this.

118
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:55,720
 - Yeah.

119
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:56,720
 - He's really no asked that project.

120
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,720
 - I think that's good.

121
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:02,720
 - I think like the bass language actually is quite good for onomatopoeic words.

122
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:03,720
 - Right.

123
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,720
 - So words that sound like they're supposed to be.

124
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:07,720
 So do you know what pill pill?

125
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:08,720
 - It's your medicine?

126
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,720
 - A pill.

127
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:10,720
 - Yeah, two pills.

128
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:11,720
 - No, no, it's onomatopoeic.

129
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:14,720
 It's going to sound like the thing pill pill.

130
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,720
 - A laser, a laser, a space laser in a film.

131
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:18,720
 - Oh, yeah.

132
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:19,720
 - Oh, that would be pew, pew.

133
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:20,720
 - Oh, yes.

134
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:23,720
 - It's the word for boiling liquid.

135
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:24,720
 - Okay, nice to see you.

136
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:25,720
 - Tren, pull pill.

137
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:26,720
 - Tren.

138
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:27,720
 - T-tren again.

139
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:28,720
 - Tren.

140
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:29,720
 - Tren.

141
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:30,720
 - Tren.

142
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:31,720
 - Tren.

143
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:32,720
 - Tren.

144
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:33,720
 - Tren.

145
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:34,720
 - Tren.

146
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:35,720
 - Tren.

147
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:36,720
 - Tren.

148
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:37,720
 - Tren.

149
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:38,720
 - Tren.

150
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:39,720
 - Tren.

151
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:40,720
 - Tren.

152
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:41,720
 - Tren.

153
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:42,720
 - Tren.

154
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:43,720
 - Tren.

155
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:44,720
 - Tren.

156
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:45,720
 - Tren.

157
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:46,720
 - Tren.

158
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,720
 - And what about this one?

159
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:49,720
 Chiza.

160
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:50,720
 - Chiza.

161
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:51,720
 - Chiza.

162
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:52,720
 - Chiza.

163
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:55,040
 (laughing)

164
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,160
 Yes, it's their word for Tom Jones.

165
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:57,980
 (laughing)

166
00:09:57,980 --> 00:10:00,640
 No, did he say no, I don't know.

167
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:04,040
 And it's their word for urinating.

168
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:07,620
 Jesus, she's a, she's a, she's a, she's a, she's a,

169
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:09,600
 she's a, like piss, pissing, I guess.

170
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,240
 Oh, not the sound that comes out,

171
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:13,000
 'cause I'd see a doctor if it's saying,

172
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:13,840
 Jesus.

173
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:15,280
 (laughing)

174
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:17,040
 I'm not sure, I think the most first of a girl,

175
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,600
 I don't quite understand that last one.

176
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:21,240
 I think actually maybe the word piss

177
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:22,480
 is quite onomatopoeic.

178
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:23,320
 Well, yeah.

179
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,160
 It's my fluid, isn't it?

180
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,360
 You're right, yes.

181
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,680
 Do you know the word bum is onomatopoeic?

182
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:28,520
 Bum.

183
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:30,360
 You mean our word bum, the word itself.

184
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:32,760
 Is it, oh, 'cause it looks like a,

185
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:33,600
 that's the only thing.

186
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,440
 That's the only thing.

187
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:37,120
 Onomatopoeic means it makes the noise.

188
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,360
 Yes.

189
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:41,040
 So, it's like a fat noise, basically.

190
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,000
 Bum, bum.

191
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:43,840
 That's interesting.

192
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:44,960
 It's the OED, anyway.

193
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:47,440
 What's it called then, what I've just mentioned,

194
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,520
 when a word looks like this object?

195
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:51,320
 I don't know if there's a word for that.

196
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:53,880
 I think it's called being made up.

197
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:56,160
 Bed looks a bit like a bed,

198
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,120
 'cause you've got the two posts at either end,

199
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:59,880
 and then you've got the curly mattress

200
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:00,800
 going all the way along.

201
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:03,800
 A famously, Dan said that the word golf

202
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:05,400
 looks like someone playing golf,

203
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,600
 'cause the O is the ball,

204
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:10,360
 and the L is the club, and the F is the flag.

205
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:11,680
 Is the word string that?

206
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,360
 Word string looks like a long piece of string,

207
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,520
 if you laid it out in the shape of the word string.

208
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:16,680
 Can I do it?

209
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:18,000
 Yeah.

210
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
 Really?

211
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,200
 We need a word for this.

212
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,200
 It's easy to dance if there isn't one, make it up.

213
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,720
 Yeah.

214
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:25,480
 They have strong links with the UK, actually,

215
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:28,000
 the BASC people, because they used to be ships,

216
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,160
 which would import English coal to the BASC region,

217
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,920
 and then the sons of the BASC bourgeoisie

218
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,800
 would go to England to be educated,

219
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:36,880
 and that, James, is it true that there is a club

220
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:39,200
 called Athletic Club Bill Bale?

221
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,200
 Oh, yeah.

222
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:44,480
 That was the biggest football teams in Spain.

223
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,320
 There we go.

224
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:47,920
 I think that team is because of that link with the UK,

225
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,760
 and with England, which had obviously, you know,

226
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,280
 where football was being developed.

227
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:52,120
 Right.

228
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,320
 I think it's Athletic Bill Bale.

229
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:55,920
 It's one of them down there where they only

230
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:58,880
 have BASC footballers who play for them,

231
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,640
 certainly until very recently,

232
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:02,680
 that you had to live within,

233
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:05,280
 or be born within 10 miles of the ground,

234
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:06,960
 otherwise you couldn't play for them.

235
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,400
 Pretty sure that's right.

236
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,240
 Nice.

237
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:12,280
 We used to get a lot of BASC iron from there,

238
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:16,360
 and they had the best iron in the world in the BASC country.

239
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:20,200
 In Hamlet, there is a line which is the mutinies

240
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:23,640
 in the Bilbo's, and they're referring to the shackles.

241
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:26,080
 The Bilbo's are the shackles that prisoners are using

242
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,480
 when they're in a boat.

243
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:31,280
 And that word Bilbo comes from the city of Bilbao,

244
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:34,120
 which is one of the biggest cities in the BASC region.

245
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:37,880
 And actually also is where Bilbo Baggins gets his name.

246
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:38,720
 Yeah.

247
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:39,720
 Interesting.

248
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:42,080
 Yeah, named after Bilbao, because,

249
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:45,080
 and that I think that talking got it from Shakespeare,

250
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,760
 it Shakespeare got it from the city.

251
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:47,760
 Right.

252
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:48,600
 That's terrific.

253
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,240
 Bilbo Baggins.

254
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,240
 Yeah.

255
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:53,240
 He's kind of, he's a bit cooler, isn't he?

256
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,240
 Yeah.

257
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,520
 Bilbo Baggins.

258
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:56,600
 He's staying up late.

259
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,760
 He's having some delicious pintos.

260
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:00,160
 It's got a sexy Spanish accent.

261
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,000
 I like it.

262
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,800
 I like him better.

263
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:06,960
 Can I just tell you one more thing about a Canadian lake?

264
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:10,280
 There is a lake with an island in it,

265
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:13,720
 and the island in the lake is bigger than the lake.

266
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:16,840
 Oh, okay, I'm sorry.

267
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:19,120
 Manacuaguan reservoir.

268
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,920
 It's in Quebec.

269
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:22,440
 Just how can, how can that be?

270
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:25,000
 So it's a ring, a quiet, a ring around.

271
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,720
 It's a ring around, basically.

272
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,240
 An annular lake.

273
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:32,040
 So basically, it was created by a meteorite.

274
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:33,720
 And then it was an upswell of land.

275
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:36,120
 So it's like a circular island.

276
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,960
 And then a circular lake.

277
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:40,720
 But the lake is only just wider than the island.

278
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:43,040
 So the water is just the ring around it.

279
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,840
 If that makes sense, very cool.

280
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:46,520
 It's like a kid's water park.

281
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:47,680
 Like a kid's water park.

282
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,480
 But how's the island bigger than the--

283
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:51,920
 Because the area of the lake is only

284
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:54,760
 the bit where the water is, which just goes around it.

285
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:56,840
 Oh, okay, okay.

286
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:58,920
 I thought you were saying that the island had grown

287
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:02,080
 like a mushroom and expanded beyond the lake.

288
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:04,120
 Well, the other thing is that--

289
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:05,520
 no, I didn't say that.

290
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:06,920
 But the other thing is that there's

291
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:08,000
 a little mountain on it.

292
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,160
 So the surface area of the island would be more as well,

293
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:13,280
 because it goes upwards as well as flowers.

294
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:14,000
 Oh, that's very cool.

295
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,840
 Anyway, that's just a thing.

296
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,640
 That's-- I mean, that's where the water slide would go.

297
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:20,800
 Top of the mountain, slide into the circular--

298
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,040
 The rubber ring, the laser ribber.

299
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:24,480
 The rubber ring, the laser ribber, thank you.

300
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:27,600
 Baseball players also love sunflower seeds, apparently,

301
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,760
 in the USA.

302
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:32,440
 To such an extent that Major League Baseball

303
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:36,800
 had to ban sunflower seed eating during 2020, why--

304
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:37,640
 COVID.

305
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:40,640
 COVID.

306
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:42,240
 I need the answer to any question where

307
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:46,080
 the word 2020 is in there.

308
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,800
 James, next time I'd appreciate a bit more

309
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:48,960
 having it all.

310
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:52,200
 Oh, the littler.

311
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:57,680
 Was it something to do with the first six weeks of 2020?

312
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,720
 It's because players were spitting.

313
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:01,720
 When they true, then they spit.

314
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:02,760
 And that was cracked down on.

315
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:04,640
 And they said, we can't trust you to eat sunflower seeds

316
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:05,600
 in not spit.

317
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,280
 They also banned after-game showers.

318
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:10,480
 I presume for the same reason, because they spit in them.

319
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:13,720
 No, I don't-- sorry.

320
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:14,800
 To COVID, I guess.

321
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,240
 To sexy.

322
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:17,240
 To sexy?

323
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:19,720
 I don't think that was the worry, wasn't it?

324
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:21,800
 A communal after-game showers?

325
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:23,920
 I think you were allowed to have a shower by yourself.

326
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,240
 I don't know.

327
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:26,560
 It wasn't too sexy.

328
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,520
 It wasn't like they couldn't help snobby each other

329
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:29,280
 as soon as they got in.

330
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:32,080
 I don't know what you think happens after a spotting event.

331
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:34,360
 I have never been close enough to a sporting event

332
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:35,360
 to find out.

333
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,720
 Is that as soon as the final whistle goes, everyone's

334
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:40,200
 kids are-- I'm making it up.

335
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:43,240
 Oh, fuck, everyone.

336
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:46,160
 Dylan Thomas and his wife, Caitlin,

337
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,400
 had an open relationship.

338
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:49,240
 So they were sleeping left, right in the centre.

339
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:50,600
 They had three kids together and Caitlin--

340
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:51,640
 With other people, right?

341
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:54,000
 Yeah, I'm just sleeping with friends.

342
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,280
 But I quite like the idea of an open relationship

343
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:58,240
 if it means you get to sleep a lot.

344
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:58,760
 Maybe.

345
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:00,240
 That sounds lovely.

346
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:00,760
 Yeah.

347
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:02,960
 Going around with a mattress strap to your back.

348
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:04,560
 This is just for maps.

349
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:05,640
 It was a definitely open.

350
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:07,640
 I thought they always got pissed off

351
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:09,240
 with each other when the other one had affairs.

352
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:10,880
 I think he did a lot of womanizing.

353
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:11,960
 He did shudders of womanizing.

354
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:13,160
 I don't know how much she did.

355
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:13,680
 She did a bunch.

356
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,760
 She said it was a miracle that her three kids

357
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:19,440
 were the children of Dylan because it was touch and go.

358
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,200
 But I think it wasn't an open relationship.

359
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,600
 If you're only touching it, then going

360
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:24,360
 is not going to be the other guy's kids.

361
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:25,040
 Santa, how it works?

362
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,600
 That's what the phone said to you.

363
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:27,840
 OK.

364
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:29,000
 Do you remember those TV shows that used

365
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,080
 to be on where you'd call up in the middle of the night?

366
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:34,080
 And it would be a competition you entered and you'd

367
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:35,440
 win a car or something.

368
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,600
 Well, you'd never win.

369
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:39,520
 Well, so there was one where there was this old man

370
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:41,040
 on the phone and he got through in there.

371
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:43,560
 And it was always really easy quiz questions.

372
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:45,800
 And the question was like, you'll win a car

373
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:46,720
 if you aren't this.

374
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:50,880
 Just tell me one word that starts with the word under.

375
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:55,200
 And this old man went, under milk word.

376
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:59,440
 Oh, he didn't win the car because it's not a word.

377
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,520
 No, it's not a word.

378
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:02,320
 All right, it's under pressure.

379
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,320
 Yeah.

380
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,320
 Also not a word.

381
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:06,800
 What?

382
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,840
 Call it number three.

383
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:11,960
 [LAUGHTER]

384
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:14,400
 Singaporeans, long hair, a famous band.

385
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:17,600
 Back when long hair was a symbol of resistance to the man.

386
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:18,600
 What year?

387
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:20,600
 Yeah, so do you know when that roughly when it stopped?

388
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:22,160
 Yeah, it was when it stopped.

389
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:22,680
 Yeah.

390
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:23,840
 I think it would have stopped in the early '80s.

391
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:24,840
 OK.

392
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:25,680
 Yeah, it happened.

393
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:26,880
 It stopped in the late '80s.

394
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:27,880
 Was it late '80s?

395
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:30,160
 Around the time of the war on piss?

396
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:30,680
 Oh, yeah.

397
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:32,160
 Maybe once they ended the band, they thought

398
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:35,840
 we freed up our judicial resources to wage war on left wing.

399
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:36,840
 Yeah.

400
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:39,440
 Yeah, there was a Japanese guy called Kitaro

401
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:43,240
 who was forced to cancel a gig in 1984 because he was long hair.

402
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:44,040
 Was he?

403
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:46,400
 And the Beeju's famously out to--

404
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,840
 they were given-- you could sometimes

405
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,520
 get a pass, a long hair pass.

406
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:51,280
 And I think one year, they came to do a gig,

407
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,520
 and they got 48 hour pass, because basically,

408
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,040
 they didn't want Singapore and Singapore

409
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:56,800
 didn't want its own people.

410
00:17:56,800 --> 00:18:00,080
 It just seems like after 46 hours someone's chasing you

411
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:03,200
 with some clippers, it looks like Cinderella.

412
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,720
 [LAUGHTER]

413
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:09,440
 They're running-- they're running to the gates of the airport.

414
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:11,280
 That's wonderful airport.

415
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,400
 They're very followed by the scissors, man.

416
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:16,040
 What was the result of them if they got busted?

417
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:17,200
 Like, how bad is the--

418
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,680
 That was-- I think you've got a large final.

419
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:21,600
 You've got a forced to cut off your hair.

420
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,360
 Oh, OK.

421
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:23,360
 It's not death sentence.

422
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:24,520
 They're just running away.

423
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,160
 Not staying alive.

424
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,440
 Not staying alive.

425
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:30,040
 Yeah, I don't think death sentence for the Beeju's.

426
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:31,200
 Right.

427
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:34,360
 But then the next year, they weren't given a pass.

428
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:36,200
 So I think it might have all been employed.

429
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:38,320
 There's a lot to stop the Beeju's coming back after.

430
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,280
 They didn't like it the first time.

431
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:43,880
 There was, if you were ever needed the government for anything.

432
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:48,560
 So let's say you needed to get some social security,

433
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:52,320
 or you needed someone to help you with some building permit

434
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:53,840
 or something that would be signs that said,

435
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:57,400
 males with one hair will be attended to last.

436
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:59,600
 So you just go to the back of the queue.

437
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:00,440
 Ouch.

438
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:02,000
 Yeah, that is strange.

439
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,320
 And long hair, the definition of quite stringent,

440
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:06,000
 all the beetles would have failed.

441
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,440
 It's like long hair is the definition

442
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:11,080
 is that if it covers your ears, or if it touches your eyebrows.

443
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:11,760
 Interesting.

444
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:14,400
 So Dan, I think if you didn't juice up your hair,

445
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,880
 whatever it is you do with that front bit--

446
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:17,600
 I juice it up, yeah.

447
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,600
 I think about my stretch to your eyebrows.

448
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,880
 [LAUGHTER]

449
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:22,720
 OK.

450
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,080
 I wonder if that would trick them though.

451
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,280
 If you could, if you did juice it up into a quick

452
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:27,280
 as you went to security.

453
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,040
 Yeah, I don't think so.

454
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:29,160
 I think they see through that.

455
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:31,400
 Or maybe a cool horn.

456
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:32,640
 Yeah, yeah.

457
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:33,640
 I mean, it is.

458
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:34,480
 How interesting.

459
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:37,400
 If you weigh in a public toilet in Singapore,

460
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:40,000
 you are legally required to flush.

461
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:40,520
 Really?

462
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:41,520
 OK.

463
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:42,960
 Like still to this day.

464
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:43,640
 I believe so.

465
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:44,640
 Yeah, right.

466
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:45,920
 It is in the rule.

467
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:46,800
 I saw that.

468
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:51,440
 And the fine from first fence is up to 1,000 pounds.

469
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:55,920
 But there is a further thing that says that it is $5,000

470
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:58,920
 for every day or part thereof during which

471
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:01,920
 the fence continues after conviction.

472
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:04,800
 So in theory, if you go for a wee and you don't flush,

473
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:08,520
 and then no one else uses that toilet for like three weeks,

474
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:11,840
 you'd have to pay $500 for each time in theory.

475
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:15,880
 Do they rope it off and say, you have to be the one

476
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:17,160
 to go back to doing it?

477
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:19,160
 In actual fact, that bit of the law

478
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:21,800
 is due to another part of the--

479
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,600
 it's a public sanitation law.

480
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:26,040
 And that part is referring really to something else.

481
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:29,600
 It's like people digging up pipes when they shouldn't be.

482
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:33,160
 But technically, according to law, if you don't flush,

483
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:35,760
 and no one flushes it for a year,

484
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:40,760
 you'd have to pay $180,000.

485
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:42,960
 And all their exemptions, if it's the middle of the night,

486
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:45,400
 and you didn't want to wake anyone up.

487
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:46,400
 I think that's fine.

488
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:47,760
 I think that's fine.

489
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:50,480
 Did you hear about the experimental lakes area in Canada?

490
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:51,120
 I loved this.

491
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:51,640
 No.

492
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:52,920
 Canada has so many lakes.

493
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:56,720
 They have set aside 58 in Ontario alone, specifically

494
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,480
 for scientific research.

495
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:03,000
 And they've spent 50 years studying these 58 lakes.

496
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,480
 And it's like a scientific playground, basically.

497
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:09,720
 So they study acid rain and they study algae blooms.

498
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:14,120
 And in 2018, they spilled 90 gallons of oil

499
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:16,400
 into one of the lakes on purpose.

500
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,560
 Because when you have an oil spill,

501
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:19,800
 normally people just rush there with cotton buds

502
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:22,480
 and clean up the birds and clean up the oil all of that.

503
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:24,480
 They were trying to work out how it moves.

504
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,240
 How do you deal with it?

505
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:27,400
 That kind of thing.

506
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:29,600
 Like maybe it just starts itself out.

507
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:30,400
 Maybe it just starts itself.

508
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,400
 And that's what they found.

509
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:33,480
 We've been wasting our time cleaning it up.

510
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:36,520
 Or Eastrogen going into the water, like synthetic Eastrogen

511
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:39,480
 in sort of medicines and things like that.

512
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:40,600
 What does that do to fish?

513
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:41,440
 Yes.

514
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:43,680
 Because it changes the sex of loads of fish and all of this.

515
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:45,880
 So they're like crash test dummy lakes

516
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:47,760
 that have massively improved water quality

517
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:48,920
 across the whole planet.

518
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:49,760
 Interesting.

519
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,360
 Because the results can be found

520
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:53,160
 and, you know, quite across the world.

521
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:54,280
 It's really cool.

522
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:56,520
 Well, there's also this lake, which is super scientifically

523
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:58,920
 important because it seems to represent

524
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:01,200
 how humans have messed up the world.

525
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,360
 This is also in Canada.

526
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:05,680
 And this is so--

527
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:07,320
 this is called Crawford Lake.

528
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:09,680
 It's 24 meters deep, but it's quite small.

529
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:11,400
 And this is when-- there's this big debate

530
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:14,440
 about whether we're in the Anthropocene area yet.

531
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:17,400
 And so the holocene has been a few thousand years.

532
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:19,800
 And then the Anthropocene is defined as the epoch

533
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:22,880
 where humans are having the biggest effect on the environment.

534
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:25,080
 And every new era-- I didn't know this--

535
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:27,080
 every new era has to have a location,

536
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:28,760
 a place that represents it.

537
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:32,440
 And it was decided this tiny little lake in Ontario, Crawford Lake,

538
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:36,240
 represented it because it's so deep, but so small,

539
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:39,240
 that the bottom waters don't mix with the top waters.

540
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:42,600
 So all the sediment that's been laid down on it over the years

541
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:43,800
 doesn't get messed around.

542
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:45,600
 So if you take a big bit of segment,

543
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,640
 a big cross section of sediment, look on it.

544
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:49,480
 You can see the mark of humans.

545
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:51,720
 So the first nuclear test immediately

546
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:53,600
 appears in your study of the sediment

547
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,800
 when fossil fuels started to be increased in use.

548
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:57,800
 That immediately appears in the sediment.

549
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:59,080
 So there's a big thing.

550
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:01,840
 Is Crawford Lake the start of the new epoch?

551
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,960
 And they've decided that no, it's not.

552
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:04,960
 Right.

553
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:07,000
 So they've decided we're not in the Anthropocene area.

554
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,240
 We're not in the Anthropocene area.

555
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:09,880
 If we were, it would be Crawford Lake.

556
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:12,480
 But I feel like if they went for another lake

557
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,200
 that wasn't in the middle of nowhere,

558
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:17,040
 they might have worked out that actually we are in it.

559
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:18,560
 Or we would have got more press at least.

560
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:22,040
 Yeah, if they had gone to like the Aral Sea or something.

561
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:24,920
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

562
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:26,320
 Or somewhere where, you know,

563
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:29,440
 it's all dried up or there's just radiation there or something.

564
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:32,640
 They're really strict about the definition of a new epoch.

565
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:33,760
 Yeah, yes, yes.

566
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:35,360
 Yeah, it's a big deal, isn't it?

567
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:36,200
 Exactly.

568
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:37,920
 You can't just go naming them Willie Nile.

569
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:40,480
 Does feel like we're there though.

570
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:43,200
 Oh, one of us, one of us around this table,

571
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,160
 will have had it more.

572
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:50,480
 I'm afraid not James that's it back down.

573
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:54,840
 Sorry, they experienced parodolia more parodolia.

574
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:56,760
 And can we guess it based on knowledge of each other?

575
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:57,760
 Absolutely.

576
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:01,880
 It's got to be Ibeth, golfer's idiots or women.

577
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:04,200
 Does feel like that.

578
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:06,040
 Maybe, maybe.

579
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:07,880
 James has ruled out.

580
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:11,560
 Well, James have it less because of his affentasia thing.

581
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:12,280
 Face blindness.

582
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:14,520
 Yeah, I don't know whether that means James has it less.

583
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:17,240
 I mean, he's all the devil of that pachora one time.

584
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:18,680
 So I think he's got it.

585
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:19,680
 OK.

586
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:21,680
 I'll try and find the picture of that pachora

587
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:22,680
 and put it on my Instagram.

588
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:23,760
 I think I can do it.

589
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:25,240
 Is it me because I wear glasses?

590
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:28,840
 And the lenses might give me little, little different

591
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:29,760
 remiserizing.

592
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,440
 No, it's not.

593
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:32,840
 So let's-- can we please wrap this up?

594
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:33,600
 Yes, all right.

595
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:36,200
 It's got to be within why it's not just women.

596
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:40,400
 Is it people who eat sushi on the train?

597
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:41,800
 You'd normally see the back of people's heads

598
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:45,400
 as they walk away along the carriage from you.

599
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:48,560
 No, it's mums.

600
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:52,080
 It's mums-- this is a study in biology letters.

601
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:55,840
 Scientists showed 380 women, a collection of images.

602
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:58,360
 And the women who had given birth in the last year

603
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:02,760
 were likely to see faces and to perceive more face-like images

604
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:04,680
 in what they saw.

605
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:07,000
 And it might be due to more oxytocin.

606
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:07,520
 We don't know.

607
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:10,600
 But it might be sort of primitive, nurturing instincts.

608
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:11,600
 Oxytocin.

609
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:12,600
 I know.

610
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:14,360
 So on my feet hurt, yeah, it's oxytocin.

611
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:15,840
 Oxytocin, yeah, yeah.

612
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:17,120
 But babies have it, too.

613
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:19,600
 So babies will spend longer looking at collections of dots

614
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:21,640
 and dashes that look a bit like a face than random dots

615
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:24,440
 and dashes, even after a few minutes of life.

616
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:26,200
 So it's a really deep program thing.

617
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:27,880
 There's face-finding stuff like that.

618
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:31,720
 Even before life, depending on when you think life starts,

619
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:34,080
 a book from time to time, this would be so easy.

620
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:35,680
 I don't want the inbox.

621
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:37,920
 We have-- the inbox is a busy place, honey.

622
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:40,440
 I'm so sorry.

623
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:42,560
 But even before they're born, babies have it,

624
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:45,040
 which I find extraordinary, because they've never seen a face.

625
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:47,120
 But they did an experiment a few years ago

626
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:52,400
 where they shone a triangle of three lights, three lit dots

627
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:55,120
 at a woman's uterus, basically, through her skin.

628
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:57,440
 And they monitored what the fetus was doing inside.

629
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:59,560
 And if the triangle has the two dots on the top

630
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:02,480
 and the one dot on the bottom, then the fetus would move around

631
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:05,040
 and crane its head towards it to look at it.

632
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:07,400
 But if it had the two dots on the bottom and the one

633
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:10,120
 dot at the top, so it oriented not like a face,

634
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:11,720
 the fetus wouldn't care.

635
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:12,520
 Wow.

636
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:14,200
 And it's never seen a face.

637
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:16,240
 That's what's going on there.

638
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:18,040
 And I've got a mirror in there.

639
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:19,760
 What is going on there?

640
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:21,360
 Do they have to put it upside down,

641
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:23,280
 because babies are sometimes upside down in the womb?

642
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:23,960
 That's a really good point.

643
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:25,040
 They must have, wasn't they?

644
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:25,720
 Yeah.

645
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:27,800
 Otherwise, the experiment is a complete wash.

646
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:32,240
 Oh my god, Andy, you should write to them, check.

647
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:36,120
 A lot of people seem to leave bomb threats on sick bags,

648
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:40,080
 which seems quite an annoying thing to do.

649
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:43,280
 And over the years, there are constant articles of--

650
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:46,800
 someone is misspelled, so I think in 2017,

651
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:48,800
 there was a fight from Sydney that had to be completely

652
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:53,000
 evacuated, because a bag said B-O-M, which doesn't--

653
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,040
 I don't know if you just seem they even meant bomb.

654
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:56,320
 There was another one that was found--

655
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:59,560
 Wait, was that not the one where they were going to Bombay?

656
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:01,480
 I'm sure there was one that happened once.

657
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:02,480
 Right.

658
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:05,680
 They wrote sort of like N-A-N to B-O-M,

659
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:07,640
 because it was Manchester to Mumbai.

660
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:09,640
 And they saw the bomb and they thought it was a bomb.

661
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:10,680
 That's really funny.

662
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:13,160
 I think these guys were going to not Bombay,

663
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:14,680
 but I can imagine that would have happened.

664
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:15,280
 Can I check?

665
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:19,040
 Is this people who are getting off a plane

666
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:21,320
 and are playing a kind of sick prank as they leave?

667
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:22,960
 They just write the word bomb on the sick bag

668
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:23,640
 and then they get off?

669
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:24,640
 We think so, yes.

670
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,400
 Which I thought the clean is a better job than that.

671
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:27,440
 But yes, it is.

672
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:30,600
 Because there was another one that was found just after a flight

673
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:32,920
 had taken off from Sydney in 2004,

674
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:35,480
 and someone found a sick bag in the toilet that said,

675
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:39,520
 Bob, which I just think is someone naming their bag.

676
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:41,840
 Well, yeah, it's two dyslexic people

677
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:44,480
 because both have spelt bomb wrong in both case, right?

678
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:45,320
 Well, yeah.

679
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:47,360
 Once missing the M and the others missing the...

680
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:48,800
 Yep, I mean, yes.

681
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:50,520
 But I mean, it could be that they weren't even trying to spell Bob.

682
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:52,600
 In fact, so they were playing out to turn around

683
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:53,840
 and had to be completely evacuated.

684
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:54,720
 The sound of the bomb on a bag.

685
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:55,840
 The sound of the bomb on a bag.

686
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:57,840
 The sound of the bomb on a bag.

687
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:58,840
 I don't know.

688
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:01,320
 I know, it does seem over gorgeous, doesn't it?

689
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:03,040
 And the stewards and stewards have said afterwards

690
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:04,680
 that, actually, apparently,

691
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:06,840
 they commonly use the letters B-O-B

692
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:08,960
 anyway as slang for best on board.

693
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:11,440
 Meaning, fitty in the, in a mile, seven.

694
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:12,280
 Oh!

695
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:14,680
 So, actually, it could have just been a stewardess, right?

696
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:17,320
 It could have always called me Bob on the plates.

697
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:18,920
 Yeah, that's why.

698
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:20,760
 That's why I'm the fittest one on the plane.

699
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:21,760
 Yeah.

700
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:22,760
 But you also chart your own flights everywhere

701
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:24,520
 and you're at the early passenger.

702
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:25,920
 Isn't that a helicopter flight?

703
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:26,760
 Do you want it?

704
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:27,600
 It's just you two.

705
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:31,560
 Do you know there's a really cool thing

706
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:33,680
 that you can see online called LightningMap.org

707
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:36,200
 and it shows you where basically every Lightning strike

708
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:37,960
 is happening live on our planet right now.

709
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:40,240
 Where's that closest Lightning storm?

710
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:42,160
 That's actually got the app open right now.

711
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:43,320
 The closest to us.

712
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:44,160
 Yeah, yeah.

713
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:46,000
 Let me make my way back to...

714
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:46,800
 No, no.

715
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:48,520
 If Panama's there, we're in the other direction.

716
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:49,520
 Yeah, yeah.

717
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:50,760
 I was, I was, I was, I was, I was, I was going the wrong way.

718
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:52,080
 I was going, I was going, yeah.

719
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:54,360
 (laughing)

720
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:57,160
 Don't, don't police.

721
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:59,000
 You're not rude, Dan thinks it's the best

722
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,280
 to get from Panama to the UK.

723
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:01,120
 Yeah, man.

724
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:03,480
 We're gonna fall off the end of the flat earth dream

725
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:04,480
 'cause right around me.

726
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:05,640
 Now, that's South Africa.

727
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:07,120
 I'm trying to, because I'm trying to bring,

728
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:10,080
 I'm trying to do this, the pinchy thing together, dude.

729
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:10,920
 Come on.

730
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:12,920
 Come on, let's miss down, let's miss down.

731
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:14,840
 Come on, let's miss down, not having you onboard, mate.

732
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:16,520
 (laughing)

733
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:17,360
 All right, here we go.

734
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:18,200
 Okay, we got it, we got it.

735
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:19,720
 Here we go.

736
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:20,560
 Okay.

737
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:22,560
 This is absolutely captivated, God, yeah.

738
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:28,280
 I can see some in, it's all in a different language.

739
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:30,960
 That's in Albania.

740
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:31,800
 Oh, please.

741
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:33,360
 All right, look out, if you're listening in Albania

742
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:37,080
 to us live as this is going out, then watch out.

743
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:38,880
 As South of Tarana.

744
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:39,720
 Oh, really?

745
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:41,040
 So if you're in the North, you're cool.

746
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:43,760
 Okay, apparently we get 40 strikes every second,

747
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:48,640
 so more than 3 million lightning strikes per day on Earth,

748
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:49,480
 which is huge.

749
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:51,320
 There's a lot.

750
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:52,680
 The worst sick bag of all time.

751
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:56,800
 This is according to expert Danny Cahillung from Sydney.

752
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:58,320
 He's another bag, I believe.

753
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:00,680
 He said the worst ever design was the 1970s.

754
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:02,480
 It's called the Six Sack.

755
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:05,200
 And the problem is it's in an envelope itself,

756
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:06,920
 which makes it quite fiddly.

757
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:09,120
 Like you're fiddling, you're getting a bag out of an envelope,

758
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:11,120
 you're opening it, you know, it's often a quite

759
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:12,800
 full time pressurised situation

760
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:14,000
 that you're throwing up on a flight.

761
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,320
 Yeah, you don't want to be opening it.

762
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:18,480
 You don't want to have to get your letter open, or I'll do you.

763
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:21,920
 In 1928, they tried anti-air sickness fumes

764
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:23,120
 throughout aeroplanes.

765
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:23,960
 Interesting.

766
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:27,520
 And that was a mixture of oxygen and cinnamon smell.

767
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:28,520
 Oh, lovely.

768
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:30,840
 And hopefully not tock a bean.

769
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:32,400
 But they would send it through the plane.

770
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:35,280
 And the idea was it would stop people from feeling sick.

771
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:36,520
 Really?

772
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:37,520
 Did it work?

773
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:38,880
 Well, we don't have it today.

774
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,400
 I don't think so, really.

775
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:41,880
 I think really in those days, people

776
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:44,200
 didn't really know what caused it.

777
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:46,040
 There was an article by some fund

778
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:47,560
 called the Guggenheim Fund, who claimed

779
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:50,000
 that it was a psychological state.

780
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,280
 So as in, it was just all in your head.

781
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:56,880
 And it could be cured by an increasing confidence in flyers.

782
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:58,880
 Maybe I think I sort of buy that.

783
00:30:58,880 --> 00:30:59,880
 Do you?

784
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:00,880
 No.

785
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:01,880
 The problem sickness is real.

786
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:03,840
 Definitely it is, but I just think if I'm nervous,

787
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:05,920
 I'm likely to throw up on any given day.

788
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:06,920
 That's fair enough.

789
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:08,800
 It's not even before the forecast.

790
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,480
 Every week.

791
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:12,760
 Grandmaster Flash collects mugs.

792
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:13,680
 OK, yeah.

793
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:16,040
 He's got 5,000, he says, in a special room.

794
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:18,640
 And he says, the room temperature is correct.

795
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:19,640
 What?

796
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:21,880
 That's just room temperature, isn't it?

797
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:27,440
 Mugs don't have an incredibly narrow range of temperatures

798
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:28,520
 they can perform in.

799
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:34,080
 A whole point of a mug is that they can go to a hundred degrees.

800
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:38,120
 But at least we know it's not like minus 200 degrees,

801
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:39,600
 or plus by 1,000 degrees.

802
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:42,160
 He keeps it very carefully between minus 200

803
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:45,560
 and plus by 1,000 degrees at that room.

804
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:47,880
 His room sells with absolutely so I'm coming.

805
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:58,400
 OK, that's it.

806
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:00,080
 That is all of our outtakes.

807
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:01,320
 Thanks, everyone.

808
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:03,520
 If you want to write into us about anything

809
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:06,680
 that we've said during the course of this compilation,

810
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:11,520
 why not drop us a line, send an email to podcast@qy.com.

811
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:13,160
 Andy will read these emails.

812
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:15,320
 And he likes to cherry pick the best of them

813
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:17,880
 and bring them to our mail bag episode

814
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:19,560
 that we do as part of Club Fish.

815
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:21,920
 So that will be out in the next couple of weeks.

816
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:24,880
 Otherwise, head to the main episode this Friday

817
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:28,240
 to find out more details about our upcoming live shows.

818
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:29,720
 And we'll see you in a couple of weeks.

819
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:31,640
 All right, Club Fishers, catch you soon.

820
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:32,640
 Goodbye.
