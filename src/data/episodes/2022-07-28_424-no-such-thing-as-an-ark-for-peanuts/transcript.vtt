00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580
 (upbeat music)

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:16.100
 - Hello, and welcome to another episode

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:17.780
 of No Such Thing as a Fish,

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:19.440
 a weekly podcast coming to you

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:21.820
 from the QI offices in Covent Garden.

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:23.020
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:25.500
 I am sitting here with Andrew Hunter Murray,

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.820
 Anna Tyshinski, and James Harkin.

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:29.100
 And once again, we have gathered

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:31.440
 around the microphones with our four favorite facts

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:32.800
 from the last seven days,

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:36.120
 and in no particular order, here we go.

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.220
 Starting with fact number one, and that is Andy.

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:41.940
 - My fact this week is that there was a job

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.600
 in the 19th century, which just involved looking at the sea

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.120
 and being able to tell when there were pilchards

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.240
 under the surface.

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:50.080
 (laughing)

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:50.920
 - Amazing.

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:52.400
 So were they, they weren't sticking their head

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:53.400
 under the sea.

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:55.800
 - No, don't be crazy, James.

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.440
 - Okay.

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:58.560
 - Little bit of inside baseball.

00:00:58.560 --> 00:00:59.980
 - Dan told us before we started recording

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:01.380
 that's what he thought the job was.

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:03.660
 - Yeah, and I told you before the recording specifically,

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.620
 so it wouldn't get mentioned on the recording,

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:06.820
 and look at us now.

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:09.640
 This is an amazing job.

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:12.300
 And it's not like they're sitting like a lifeguard

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:13.620
 on a boat looking down.

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:14.740
 They're up on a hill.

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:15.580
 - They are.

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:16.420
 - They're not even in the sea.

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:17.740
 - So I should say where this comes from.

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:20.260
 It comes from this brilliant blog called About 1816,

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.420
 which is by an author called James Hobson,

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:23.940
 who's written loads of books about George and Britain.

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:25.100
 There's one about stage coaches,

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:26.500
 which I was reading recently.

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:28.840
 And he also writes about Cornish-piltered culture

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:30.560
 in the 18th century.

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:31.980
 - An obvious crossover.

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:34.320
 - And well, there were these,

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.160
 it was this huge part of Cornwall's economy

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:38.680
 in the 18th century was piltered fishing

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:41.280
 because they were these fish that came to the coast

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.080
 by the million, millions and millions of them.

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:47.120
 This job was called being a hewer,

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:49.440
 literally like hue and cry, you know, shouting.

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:51.160
 And they would stand on the high points along the coast.

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:55.120
 And when they saw this moving patch of purpley,

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:57.280
 oily color on the surface,

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:00.020
 they knew that was the sign that there was the huge,

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.860
 I was about to say flock,

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:02.740
 a shoal of pilchards underneath it.

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:04.820
 And maybe there was some sea birds hanging around it as well.

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:06.740
 And then they would blow a special trumpet

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:09.540
 or they would wave their little flags

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:11.740
 and they would shout, go and get the pilchards

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:12.580
 to the fishermen.

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:13.420
 And then the fishermen would go and.

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:15.560
 - No, they would, they would shout, hever.

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:16.400
 - Trick.

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:17.240
 - Yeah, hever.

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:18.080
 - What does that mean, hever?

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:20.020
 - It's an old word meaning fish and carnage.

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:21.460
 - Ah, fish.

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:23.360
 - But now you get hever cake

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:24.700
 if you go to a Cornish bakery.

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:26.320
 - But it's not fish cake.

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:30.240
 It's just related to the cake that was baked

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:32.280
 for these fishermen when they would leave for the day out.

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:33.120
 - Oh, okay, yeah.

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:34.760
 - And the trumpet thing, by the way,

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:37.600
 hewing is an old word for trumpeting,

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:39.440
 according to the OED.

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:40.280
 - Apparently, yes.

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:42.160
 - And it's not, this is not like your regular trumpet.

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:43.940
 This was a four foot trumpet.

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:44.780
 - Was it?

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:45.620
 - Yes, huge.

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:46.460
 - I know this.

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:48.680
 - And they had these flags as well.

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:50.440
 So they would wave semaphore flags,

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:54.000
 which had special meanings to communicate to the boats,

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.380
 like go over there or come this way a bit or whatever.

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:59.080
 - 'Cause then they directed the boats, didn't they?

00:02:59.080 --> 00:02:59.920
 - Yeah, exactly.

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:00.760
 - Which they'd seen them.

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:02.200
 'Cause Wilkie Collins, obviously,

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:03.260
 and I'm famous, Victorian author,

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:04.580
 but he also wrote a bunch of essays

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:06.220
 and one of them was about these hewers.

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:09.060
 And he described them as feverishly waving

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:10.740
 two cloth-covered bushes,

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:14.620
 acting the part of a maniac of the most dangerous character.

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:16.660
 'Cause they're just standing on a cliffside.

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:18.980
 - Cloth-covered bushes, like before they had flags,

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:21.220
 they had to cover a bush in cloth.

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:22.300
 It's weird.

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:23.500
 They could have just waved around the cloth,

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:24.340
 if you would think.

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:25.160
 - Yeah.

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:26.000
 What would they, presumably,

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.740
 if you had spotted, you've sounded your horn,

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:31.360
 you've got your semaphore flag out, bush.

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:33.040
 Presumably, you've sounded the horn

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:34.840
 because you've seen pilchards.

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:35.680
 Okay?

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:36.520
 You've seen them over that way.

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:37.560
 - Otherwise, you're gonna lose your job as a killer.

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:38.640
 - You're gonna lose your job, exactly.

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:40.920
 It's the main purpose of the job.

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:42.400
 You've pointed your flag at the direction.

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:43.960
 What semaphore needs to happen?

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:45.920
 What are you trying to communicate with the semaphore?

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:48.960
 - You're telling the boats where they are specifically.

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:51.120
 So you're saying go to the right, go to the left,

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:52.600
 go out to sea, come closer.

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:53.440
 - Okay.

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:54.920
 - Just drop your nets there, kind of thing.

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:55.760
 - Yeah.

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:57.760
 - It was probably less complex semaphore

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:00.280
 and more just pointing a flag to the right or to the left.

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:01.520
 - I'm pretty sure it was proper.

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:02.360
 It was proper.

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:03.200
 I've looked up the signals.

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:04.560
 Yeah, yeah, I've looked up the signals.

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:06.520
 So it wasn't just, you know, left for left.

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:07.360
 - So what were they?

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:08.180
 I take it back.

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:09.240
 - I mean, this is the worst possible medium

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:11.000
 to communicate what the semaphore signals were.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:11.840
 - You can explain.

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:12.680
 - You know.

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:13.520
 But it's just like you said, James,

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:15.540
 there will be go east or go right off,

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:16.780
 which means go straight out.

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:18.440
 It doesn't mean go right.

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:20.160
 And cast net.

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:21.000
 - Oh, yeah.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.680
 - Also, they could get messages to ships.

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:25.880
 So they could signal to a man on board a ship

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:27.480
 that his wife had had a baby.

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:28.320
 - Ah.

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:29.160
 - Yeah.

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:30.000
 - In semaphore language.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.220
 - I don't know what the semaphore for that was.

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:33.320
 (laughing)

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:34.160
 - That's so good.

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:35.760
 - They're seriously oily.

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:37.280
 I've never really understood when people talk about

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:39.880
 oily fish and the non-oily fish,

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:42.920
 and they're bang on about oily fish being really good for you.

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:44.680
 What really, what the difference was,

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:45.760
 but that's why they were prized.

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:46.600
 So in the 19th century,

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:49.120
 they were prized for their oil for lamps, weren't they?

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:49.960
 - Yeah.

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:50.800
 - And so that would just be sold

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:52.680
 and that would fund the whole industry.

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:53.520
 - Yeah.

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:55.480
 - And you'd have these filtered palaces.

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:56.320
 - Yes.

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:58.400
 - Where they put all the fish in a barrel,

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:01.600
 put 6,000 fish in a huge hog-seed barrel.

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:04.560
 And then I think you squeeze down on the fish

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:08.320
 and all the oil comes out and drains off into the gutters.

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:10.240
 And then that's barreled up separately.

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:11.080
 - Yeah, right.

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:12.520
 - And you burnt, you can use it for lamps and things like that.

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:14.040
 - Well, they used to just hand them out as well

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:15.200
 to anyone who was quite poor.

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:16.760
 So as the boats would come back in,

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:19.340
 there's reports that you would have locals standing

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:22.200
 in the water just waiting for it to come in and say,

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:24.240
 "Can you please just give me Pilchards?"

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:26.920
 And the person who was on the ship would feel

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:29.320
 it was honor-bound to give the Pilchards.

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:30.480
 So they would just hand them out.

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:31.880
 And then at the palaces as well,

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:33.320
 there would be the poor waiting outside

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:34.480
 and they would be waiting for fish

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:37.080
 that had like broken backs or that were diseased

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:39.200
 or you know, the ones that were being shot.

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:42.200
 - They must have derived from these 30 million Pilchards

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:43.640
 with little x-ray machines.

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:45.200
 See if they've broken their spine.

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:47.360
 - Well, this one's got a bit of a cuff.

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:48.200
 - That's the paw.

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:50.320
 - Cross the line.

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:52.140
 - But the only thing kids used to go to the beaches

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:55.140
 with plastic bags and kind of scoop them out of the water.

00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:56.820
 But it's not just today.

00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:58.500
 - Plastic bags?

00:05:58.500 --> 00:05:59.500
 - But not plastic.

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:00.340
 (laughing)

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:03.860
 - Quite century and now, Cornwall is, you know,

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:05.140
 quite behind the times in some aspects,

00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:06.740
 but in others, unbelievably advanced.

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:09.620
 - It had the Tesco plastic bags early in the 1400s.

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:10.980
 - They had the oil to make it from, didn't they?

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:11.940
 'Cause it was a bloody Pilchard.

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:12.940
 - Yes, exactly.

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:16.820
 Sorry, not plastic bags, other bags, non-plastic bags.

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:19.320
 - But yeah, so it was back in the 1800s, it was massive.

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:22.360
 And in 1871, they were exporting

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:25.600
 roughly 16,000 tons per year.

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:29.160
 Now, that declined massively in Cornwall,

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:31.600
 massively, massively, to the point of the 90s

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:35.760
 where they were only landing about six tons in total.

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:38.720
 So from 16,000 to six tons, and that's the early 90s.

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:41.280
 But then that all changed when a man called Nutty Nowhere

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:45.280
 came along and he reinvigorated the whole thing

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:47.740
 by rebranding the Pilchard.

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:48.860
 - I've seen Nutty Nowhere.

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:51.180
 I think he's making some strong claims.

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:52.740
 - Huge claims.

00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:54.460
 - Well, he's basically just a random fisherman.

00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:56.340
 Is he from the South Coast?

00:06:56.340 --> 00:06:57.860
 - Yes, what's he climbing?

00:06:57.860 --> 00:06:59.300
 - He's from Cadwyth?

00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:00.140
 - Oh, he's from Cadwyth.

00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:01.740
 Okay, yeah, I go to Cadwyth every year.

00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:03.540
 I probably met him down the pub.

00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:05.460
 And I don't know if he's a guy

00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:06.540
 who's reformed the whole industry.

00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:08.100
 I mean, it's not like everyone's eating Pilchards

00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:08.940
 for every meal, right?

00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:10.740
 - No, but I mean, a lot of people,

00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:13.700
 when you read interviews, sort of claim that he called them

00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:15.960
 Cornish Sardines, that suddenly was like,

00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:17.360
 "Ooh, that sounds a bit posh."

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:18.800
 - Well, someone called them that.

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:19.840
 They have had a rebrand.

00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:20.680
 - Yeah, exactly.

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:21.800
 It wasn't him, but it was in that.

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:23.080
 Well, actually, no, it was him.

00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:23.920
 - It wasn't him.

00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:26.720
 It was a guy called Nick Howell, I believe, in the '90s,

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:29.920
 who, yeah, realized that Pilchards had a bad reputation.

00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:31.880
 They're called Sardines on the continent.

00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:33.080
 And so, yeah, they were called.

00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:35.440
 And Pilchards are just adult Sardines,

00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:37.680
 what we call Sardines, Pilchards are like adult versions

00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:39.240
 of that, aren't they? - And they're all herring.

00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:40.600
 - And they're all types of herring.

00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:42.600
 - What was his connection then to Nutty Nowhere?

00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:43.440
 - 'Cause Nutty Nowhere was--

00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:44.280
 - I don't know who Nutty Nowhere is.

00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:45.860
 - Oh, Nutty Nowhere's a guy called Martin Ellis,

00:07:45.860 --> 00:07:47.260
 and he was basically the only--

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:48.820
 (laughing)

00:07:48.820 --> 00:07:50.540
 - Why do you keep calling him Nutty Nowhere?

00:07:50.540 --> 00:07:51.460
 - Well, that's what he calls himself.

00:07:51.460 --> 00:07:52.820
 It's his nickname.

00:07:52.820 --> 00:07:54.380
 And he kind of--

00:07:54.380 --> 00:07:56.800
 - Yeah, he collected two of every nuts, didn't he?

00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:58.100
 (laughing)

00:07:58.100 --> 00:07:59.780
 Saved them when there was a big flood.

00:07:59.780 --> 00:08:00.740
 - Exactly.

00:08:00.740 --> 00:08:02.260
 - Two peanuts.

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:04.700
 - Well, ironically, apparently, his ship sank,

00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:06.700
 so I don't think, that's the story.

00:08:06.700 --> 00:08:07.540
 Did you read this?

00:08:07.540 --> 00:08:08.380
 - No.

00:08:08.380 --> 00:08:10.580
 - He took in too much Pilchard.

00:08:10.580 --> 00:08:12.760
 It's got too heavy, and his ship went down,

00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:14.520
 and it had to be rescued,

00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:16.080
 and the helicopter had to come in to do it.

00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:17.860
 - The helicopter's rescuing a whole ship.

00:08:17.860 --> 00:08:18.800
 (laughing)

00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:20.840
 - I think him and the Pilchards, possibly.

00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:21.680
 - Oh, sir.

00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:23.280
 (laughing)

00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:25.120
 - Take the Pilchards first.

00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:26.520
 - But this one's gonna broken back.

00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:27.860
 I don't care.

00:08:27.860 --> 00:08:29.360
 - Women in Pilchards first.

00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:32.400
 (laughing)

00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:36.280
 - Yeah, but the point is, I can't find any record

00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:39.680
 of a helicopter picking up a Pilchard man called Nutty Nowhere.

00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:41.660
 So it's the story that's told to him.

00:08:41.660 --> 00:08:43.460
 - I think they do a lot of rescues out in Cornwall.

00:08:43.460 --> 00:08:44.300
 - But they log them as well.

00:08:44.300 --> 00:08:46.160
 There's a log rescues.

00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:47.980
 - You do have to log the rescues.

00:08:47.980 --> 00:08:50.300
 It's frowned on to just go around rescuing people

00:08:50.300 --> 00:08:51.140
 and they're not telling anyone.

00:08:51.140 --> 00:08:52.540
 - Did you check Nutty Nowhere and his actual name,

00:08:52.540 --> 00:08:53.380
 Martin, whenever it is?

00:08:53.380 --> 00:08:54.620
 - Good point, I just did Nutty Nowhere.

00:08:54.620 --> 00:08:56.620
 I should go back and check Martin Ellis.

00:08:56.620 --> 00:08:58.180
 - They wouldn't put it on the form, would they?

00:08:58.180 --> 00:09:00.220
 Like, person rescues.

00:09:00.220 --> 00:09:01.260
 - It was a massive list.

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:03.940
 There was six tons of Pilchard that I had to get through

00:09:03.940 --> 00:09:04.780
 before his name came.

00:09:04.780 --> 00:09:05.620
 (laughing)

00:09:05.620 --> 00:09:06.940
 Every individual one.

00:09:06.940 --> 00:09:07.780
 - Every Pilchard.

00:09:07.780 --> 00:09:09.960
 - I mean, actually, Billy, Sarah.

00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:11.880
 (laughing)

00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:14.120
 They are elsewhere.

00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:16.680
 It's not just Cornwall that has a monopoly on them.

00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:19.760
 And I actually, when I was looking at my Pilchard can

00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:21.120
 and realized it came from South Africa,

00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:22.400
 I thought, "I wonder how many there are?"

00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:24.280
 And there are shed loads in South Africa

00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:26.600
 and they've turned it into a big tourist industry there.

00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:29.200
 And the Sardine Harvest, the Pilchard Harvest,

00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:32.440
 is so massive that sometimes they don't need nets

00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:36.040
 'cause the sea just dumps piles on the beach.

00:09:36.040 --> 00:09:38.120
 - Oh, wow.

00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:38.960
 - The sea retreats.

00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:41.180
 - Also, just like a tractor or a dump truck.

00:09:41.180 --> 00:09:43.160
 - Exactly, scoop it up.

00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:46.240
 And yeah, they've got sort of festival days

00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:48.440
 where they invite tourists to come and take part

00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:50.980
 in various Sardine marches and stuff like that.

00:09:50.980 --> 00:09:52.340
 No one knows why they go there.

00:09:52.340 --> 00:09:54.620
 But it's kind of a mystery because the shores

00:09:54.620 --> 00:09:56.820
 of like Northern South Africa where they hang out

00:09:56.820 --> 00:09:58.960
 are not very appealing to Sardines.

00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:01.380
 - And do we know why they come to Cornwall?

00:10:01.380 --> 00:10:04.360
 Are they mating, or are they feeding?

00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:05.580
 - Oh, we don't know.

00:10:05.580 --> 00:10:07.240
 I think it's for feeding.

00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:08.520
 I think they're coming.

00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:09.920
 Which way would they be coming?

00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:11.120
 I think it's for feeding.

00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:13.480
 - But that African Sardine run that you mentioned, Anna,

00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:16.960
 that might be the biggest biological movement on the planet

00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:19.840
 'cause there's also the East African wildebeest herds.

00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:21.200
 Obviously, your individual wildebeest,

00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:23.840
 lot bigger than your individual Pilchard.

00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:26.040
 But there are so many Pilchards

00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:28.200
 that they might outweigh all the wildebeest.

00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:29.280
 It's hard to tell.

00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:30.120
 - It's one of those classic,

00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:32.120
 would you rather fight one wildebeest

00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:34.120
 or a thousand Pilchards?

00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:36.140
 - It depends where you're fighting them.

00:10:36.140 --> 00:10:37.740
 If you're in the sea,

00:10:37.740 --> 00:10:38.900
 I'll take on the wildebeest.

00:10:38.900 --> 00:10:40.380
 (laughing)

00:10:40.380 --> 00:10:41.380
 - 'Cause they've challenged you.

00:10:41.380 --> 00:10:44.100
 You are the one who gets to choose the location.

00:10:44.100 --> 00:10:46.100
 I would choose actually a hot air balloon for either.

00:10:46.100 --> 00:10:47.100
 For either fight.

00:10:47.100 --> 00:10:47.940
 - That's clever.

00:10:47.940 --> 00:10:49.020
 - Playing it really safe.

00:10:49.020 --> 00:10:50.540
 Don't even back yourself against the Pilchards

00:10:50.540 --> 00:10:51.380
 on the desert.

00:10:51.380 --> 00:10:53.020
 (laughing)

00:10:53.020 --> 00:10:54.100
 - Why take the risk?

00:10:54.100 --> 00:10:56.820
 - They have a tendency of disappearing and reappearing.

00:10:56.820 --> 00:10:58.580
 So I think people keep blaming the decline

00:10:58.580 --> 00:11:01.500
 of Pilchard industry on like people's declining tastes.

00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:03.900
 But they just bugger off sometimes.

00:11:03.900 --> 00:11:05.400
 This is the thing with oily fish,

00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:06.920
 is why you can't depend on them.

00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:08.520
 'Cause they slip through your fingers.

00:11:08.520 --> 00:11:10.400
 'Cause the reason they're,

00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:11.440
 it's not 'cause of that.

00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:13.520
 The reason they're oily is 'cause they have to have loads

00:11:13.520 --> 00:11:15.120
 of fat in their body because they're the fish

00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:18.600
 that migrate huge distances in massive shoals.

00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:20.280
 So that's why you've got these oily fish.

00:11:20.280 --> 00:11:21.440
 They're fish that pelagic,

00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:23.280
 that live in the middle part of the sea,

00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:24.480
 as opposed to all your white fish,

00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:25.320
 which live at the bottom.

00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:26.160
 - Good word.

00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:27.880
 - Which I think very much.

00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:29.200
 I didn't make it up myself.

00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:30.240
 (laughing)

00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:31.280
 But thank you.

00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:33.160
 So these shoals sometimes migrate somewhere different.

00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:36.500
 So in 1820, we say the industry was massive.

00:11:36.500 --> 00:11:39.420
 In 1820, they all disappeared and went to Ireland.

00:11:39.420 --> 00:11:41.260
 And the Cornish were really furious.

00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:44.140
 And there were articles written in the 1820s saying,

00:11:44.140 --> 00:11:45.580
 you know, this is a complete disaster.

00:11:45.580 --> 00:11:47.100
 The Irish don't like Pilchards.

00:11:47.100 --> 00:11:49.420
 They're just flocking to Ireland and the Irish are saying,

00:11:49.420 --> 00:11:50.340
 we think these are disgusting.

00:11:50.340 --> 00:11:52.460
 - The Irish do have their own hewers though,

00:11:52.460 --> 00:11:54.620
 and they have their special laws for their hewers.

00:11:54.620 --> 00:11:57.780
 - So I think it's got Pilchard fanciings gone up and down.

00:11:57.780 --> 00:12:00.620
 So they have sometimes had a big hewering tradition.

00:12:00.620 --> 00:12:02.620
 And then it just went out of fashion.

00:12:02.620 --> 00:12:03.460
 - Okay.

00:12:03.460 --> 00:12:05.960
 There's a special law in Ireland that if you're a hewer,

00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:08.280
 you're allowed to stand on any private property

00:12:08.280 --> 00:12:09.120
 to do your job.

00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:09.960
 - No way.

00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:10.800
 - What?

00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:12.820
 - I mean, you can't go into the middle of Dublin.

00:12:12.820 --> 00:12:15.420
 Like just stand in someone's house.

00:12:15.420 --> 00:12:17.360
 - I need to come into your bedroom now.

00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:18.640
 (laughing)

00:12:18.640 --> 00:12:21.680
 - Presumably it's someone's property that's on the coast.

00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:25.840
 - I got reason to believe there are five million Pilchards

00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:26.840
 in this room.

00:12:26.840 --> 00:12:27.680
 Let me in.

00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:30.240
 Let me into this bank vault right now.

00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:31.540
 Help me with my trumpet.

00:12:32.540 --> 00:12:37.160
 Can I just ask on the hewers that you said it was a job,

00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:40.700
 but they, I mean, the Pilchards just turn up

00:12:40.700 --> 00:12:42.700
 at one stage in the autumn, right?

00:12:42.700 --> 00:12:43.740
 So what do they do for the,

00:12:43.740 --> 00:12:45.260
 it's very seasonal this job, isn't it?

00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:46.260
 - It is seasonal work.

00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:48.060
 You're absolutely right.

00:12:48.060 --> 00:12:51.300
 I don't, I imagine they had a kind of portfolio career.

00:12:51.300 --> 00:12:53.220
 - They might be a trumpeter for the rest of the year.

00:12:53.220 --> 00:12:54.060
 - Yeah, absolutely.

00:12:54.060 --> 00:12:56.060
 Or a Bush, Semaphore instructor.

00:12:56.060 --> 00:12:57.380
 I mean, there's all sorts of stuff they could do

00:12:57.380 --> 00:12:58.220
 with their skills, you know.

00:12:58.220 --> 00:13:01.140
 But they had, yeah, they did get paid a guinea week

00:13:01.140 --> 00:13:02.140
 during the good times.

00:13:02.140 --> 00:13:04.140
 So maybe it was one of those jobs where,

00:13:04.140 --> 00:13:05.780
 much like a tourist season today actually,

00:13:05.780 --> 00:13:07.220
 you know, it's very big in the high seas.

00:13:07.220 --> 00:13:09.660
 And then you just sort of, you know.

00:13:09.660 --> 00:13:11.020
 - Could be a signalman.

00:13:11.020 --> 00:13:12.060
 - Yes. - A woman.

00:13:12.060 --> 00:13:13.020
 - Yeah, on the railways.

00:13:13.020 --> 00:13:13.860
 On the railways, for example.

00:13:13.860 --> 00:13:15.660
 - On the railways. - At the airports.

00:13:15.660 --> 00:13:16.780
 - At the airports, yep.

00:13:16.780 --> 00:13:18.620
 - Could be a plastic bag maker.

00:13:18.620 --> 00:13:19.960
 - Yeah.

00:13:19.960 --> 00:13:22.540
 (upbeat music)

00:13:22.540 --> 00:13:27.580
 - Okay, it is time for fact number two.

00:13:27.580 --> 00:13:28.820
 And that is my fact.

00:13:28.820 --> 00:13:31.260
 My fact this week is that the sound designer

00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:35.060
 for the movie King Richard is called Richard King.

00:13:35.060 --> 00:13:35.900
 - So good.

00:13:35.900 --> 00:13:36.740
 - Yeah, so good.

00:13:36.740 --> 00:13:37.580
 - So great.

00:13:37.580 --> 00:13:38.820
 Did you just, did you just spot this?

00:13:38.820 --> 00:13:41.300
 - No, this was a buddy of mine, Ali Plum.

00:13:41.300 --> 00:13:44.940
 He's the BBC Radio One music reviewer and interviewer.

00:13:44.940 --> 00:13:46.940
 He spotted it and he told me about it.

00:13:46.940 --> 00:13:49.460
 And yeah, Richard King is, you know,

00:13:49.460 --> 00:13:52.540
 he's actually quite famous as you can imagine.

00:13:52.540 --> 00:13:54.100
 He's part of this big movie.

00:13:54.100 --> 00:13:55.180
 - He's won for Oscars.

00:13:55.180 --> 00:13:56.500
 - He's won for Oscars.

00:13:56.500 --> 00:13:58.300
 And he's, you know, he's been the sound designer for movies

00:13:58.300 --> 00:14:00.740
 like The Latest Wonder Woman 1984,

00:14:00.740 --> 00:14:01.820
 Tenet Dunkirk.

00:14:01.820 --> 00:14:03.740
 So he's very tied in with Christopher Nolan.

00:14:03.740 --> 00:14:05.060
 He did Interstellar with him.

00:14:05.060 --> 00:14:07.540
 - Do we know if Richard King only took the job

00:14:07.540 --> 00:14:11.060
 because he enjoyed the symmetry of the name?

00:14:11.060 --> 00:14:13.860
 - Oh, I've got a good reason why he might.

00:14:13.860 --> 00:14:15.420
 Tenet is all about things being backwards

00:14:15.420 --> 00:14:16.260
 as well as forwards.

00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:17.100
 - Palindromic.

00:14:17.100 --> 00:14:18.500
 - King Richard, Richard King.

00:14:18.500 --> 00:14:20.900
 That's, it explains why he took the job

00:14:20.900 --> 00:14:22.940
 as well as him being a massively respected sound engineer

00:14:22.940 --> 00:14:24.980
 and him needing the work.

00:14:24.980 --> 00:14:27.740
 But for Tenet, this is one specific thing.

00:14:27.740 --> 00:14:29.180
 So I haven't seen Tenet.

00:14:29.180 --> 00:14:32.900
 It sounds, so some things happen backwards

00:14:32.900 --> 00:14:34.220
 even though the world is happening forwards.

00:14:34.220 --> 00:14:36.380
 - Yeah, you kind of got two parallel things

00:14:36.380 --> 00:14:38.180
 that happen in one goes forward and one goes backwards.

00:14:38.180 --> 00:14:39.660
 - Why haven't I watched it?

00:14:39.660 --> 00:14:41.340
 But they had to make reverse gunshots.

00:14:41.340 --> 00:14:44.460
 So they tried playing all the sound effects they had.

00:14:44.460 --> 00:14:46.500
 You know, they have a sound effect of a gun,

00:14:46.500 --> 00:14:48.960
 which is a bang.

00:14:48.960 --> 00:14:49.800
 And then.

00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:51.900
 - Why didn't they just use you for that?

00:14:51.900 --> 00:14:53.180
 (laughing)

00:14:53.180 --> 00:14:54.860
 - But it's, but it sounded rubbish.

00:14:54.860 --> 00:14:55.940
 It sounded cheap and stupid

00:14:55.940 --> 00:14:57.020
 when they just played the sounds backwards.

00:14:57.020 --> 00:15:00.460
 So they had to generate new sounds of what, you know,

00:15:00.460 --> 00:15:02.380
 playing, taking off might sound like backwards,

00:15:02.380 --> 00:15:03.220
 but forwards. - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:15:03.220 --> 00:15:04.420
 Interesting. - It's so weird.

00:15:04.420 --> 00:15:06.500
 - 'Cause they could have just taken the original one

00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:08.500
 and made it go backwards, right?

00:15:08.500 --> 00:15:09.980
 'Cause they have that technology,

00:15:09.980 --> 00:15:11.660
 but it doesn't quite sound right.

00:15:11.660 --> 00:15:14.580
 - They have the technology to make sound rewind.

00:15:14.580 --> 00:15:15.940
 You're kidding. - It's amazing.

00:15:15.940 --> 00:15:17.300
 - I haven't been able to share this with the rest of us.

00:15:17.300 --> 00:15:18.820
 - 20 years ago, they had that.

00:15:18.820 --> 00:15:21.100
 But the thing is that King Richard is about tennis

00:15:21.100 --> 00:15:22.660
 and that movie is Tenet.

00:15:22.660 --> 00:15:25.860
 So maybe he's just looking his way through the fix.

00:15:25.860 --> 00:15:27.180
 - He's definitely got a word thing.

00:15:27.180 --> 00:15:29.620
 He's the Susie Dent of the sound engineer world.

00:15:29.620 --> 00:15:30.460
 - Sounds like.

00:15:30.460 --> 00:15:31.300
 - I don't know.

00:15:31.300 --> 00:15:32.140
 I wonder if this movie does

00:15:32.140 --> 00:15:35.300
 because they had a carpenter called James Crane.

00:15:35.300 --> 00:15:36.700
 Carpenter's might use cranes,

00:15:36.700 --> 00:15:37.540
 might, and they--

00:15:37.540 --> 00:15:38.380
 - Why?

00:15:38.380 --> 00:15:39.500
 I thought it was a carpeting emergency frame

00:15:39.500 --> 00:15:40.820
 for me to look like, oh yeah.

00:15:40.820 --> 00:15:42.340
 - Okay, look, this is--

00:15:42.340 --> 00:15:44.340
 - The viewer was stuck somewhere in Ireland.

00:15:44.340 --> 00:15:46.140
 - This is the one I'm opening with.

00:15:46.140 --> 00:15:46.980
 (laughing)

00:15:46.980 --> 00:15:50.540
 They had an ellen safety manager called Guinevere Aid,

00:15:50.540 --> 00:15:51.380
 like first aid.

00:15:51.380 --> 00:15:52.220
 - Yeah, that's good.

00:15:52.220 --> 00:15:53.060
 - I think that's good, yeah.

00:15:53.060 --> 00:15:58.060
 The tennis racket stringer was called Jeffrey Ibatuon.

00:15:58.060 --> 00:15:59.140
 - That's not true.

00:15:59.140 --> 00:15:59.980
 - Ibatuon.

00:15:59.980 --> 00:16:00.800
 - Ibatuon.

00:16:00.800 --> 00:16:01.640
 - How are you spelling it?

00:16:01.640 --> 00:16:02.980
 How much of your words for pronunciation?

00:16:02.980 --> 00:16:04.940
 - No, no, I-B-A-T-U-A-N.

00:16:04.940 --> 00:16:05.780
 Ibatuon.

00:16:05.780 --> 00:16:06.620
 - Oh, wow.

00:16:06.620 --> 00:16:08.540
 - Okay, that's extremely good.

00:16:08.540 --> 00:16:10.500
 I would definitely have opened with Ibatuon

00:16:10.500 --> 00:16:12.860
 rather than James Crane, the carpenter.

00:16:12.860 --> 00:16:13.700
 (laughing)

00:16:13.700 --> 00:16:15.580
 If he'd been called James Plane,

00:16:15.580 --> 00:16:17.340
 I'd have been absolutely on board.

00:16:17.340 --> 00:16:19.660
 - I'll be honest, like I was working on

00:16:19.660 --> 00:16:22.140
 just basically all the people who worked on this show

00:16:22.140 --> 00:16:24.620
 on IMDB and it was Slim Pickings.

00:16:24.620 --> 00:16:25.460
 (laughing)

00:16:25.460 --> 00:16:26.460
 - It was Slim Pickings on it.

00:16:26.460 --> 00:16:27.740
 (laughing)

00:16:27.740 --> 00:16:28.580
 I love him.

00:16:28.580 --> 00:16:32.900
 So sound design has a nickname,

00:16:32.900 --> 00:16:35.260
 which is used within the industry, which is called Foley.

00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:36.660
 So you're a Foley artist.

00:16:36.660 --> 00:16:38.780
 Foley sounds within movies.

00:16:38.780 --> 00:16:40.060
 It's really amazing.

00:16:40.060 --> 00:16:42.260
 And particularly if you read interviews with Richard King,

00:16:42.260 --> 00:16:45.260
 he can make something that is quite a boring sound.

00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:46.500
 Some of these seem like, wow,

00:16:46.500 --> 00:16:48.900
 what a day that must have been of picking the sound

00:16:48.900 --> 00:16:51.660
 for this tiny thing that I would never think about.

00:16:51.660 --> 00:16:55.100
 If you're in a room and a door needs to be opened, right?

00:16:55.100 --> 00:16:57.260
 You would think, okay, there's probably just this bank

00:16:57.260 --> 00:16:59.140
 of sound where it's just door opens.

00:16:59.140 --> 00:17:02.500
 And he talks about it saying, no, the variety is endless.

00:17:02.500 --> 00:17:05.780
 You have doors that are opened because maybe they're open

00:17:05.780 --> 00:17:07.180
 because there's a baby sleeping in the room.

00:17:07.180 --> 00:17:08.220
 So it's a soft opening.

00:17:08.220 --> 00:17:10.540
 So he's like, you don't only have just the creaks

00:17:10.540 --> 00:17:13.240
 of a door speed opening, you have emotional content

00:17:13.240 --> 00:17:14.700
 to the opening of the door.

00:17:14.700 --> 00:17:16.140
 And he's like, so I have like, you know,

00:17:16.140 --> 00:17:18.060
 he's got thousands of doors that he's collected.

00:17:18.060 --> 00:17:20.500
 - The door, the happy door, the furious door.

00:17:20.500 --> 00:17:24.340
 - Drunk door, Terminator 2 I was reading about.

00:17:24.340 --> 00:17:26.320
 The opening scene of Terminator 2,

00:17:26.320 --> 00:17:29.800
 there's a sort of exoskeleton terminator walking

00:17:29.800 --> 00:17:33.140
 in a apocalypse over all these skulls and stuff.

00:17:33.140 --> 00:17:35.100
 So the ambient sound that you hear in that scene,

00:17:35.100 --> 00:17:36.660
 if you watch that scene next time,

00:17:36.660 --> 00:17:39.100
 is you've got someone having put a microphone

00:17:39.100 --> 00:17:40.980
 just next to the crack in the door

00:17:40.980 --> 00:17:44.020
 at George Lucas' Skywalker Ranch

00:17:44.020 --> 00:17:46.860
 and just getting the ambience of the outside.

00:17:46.860 --> 00:17:49.460
 And that's mixed with someone going, whoosh,

00:17:49.460 --> 00:17:51.460
 with their mouth, whoosh.

00:17:51.460 --> 00:17:52.980
 So that's what you're hearing in the background.

00:17:52.980 --> 00:17:55.820
 And then when this exoskeleton is standing

00:17:55.820 --> 00:17:57.660
 on all of these human skulls,

00:17:57.660 --> 00:17:59.580
 that's pistachio nuts being crushed.

00:17:59.580 --> 00:18:01.660
 So those are the elements that you see in that scene.

00:18:01.660 --> 00:18:04.580
 And just how they get to thinking a pistachio nut

00:18:04.580 --> 00:18:07.620
 can be a better sound than a real skull being crushed.

00:18:07.620 --> 00:18:08.940
 (laughing)

00:18:08.940 --> 00:18:11.060
 - Sometimes easy to access pistachio nut shells,

00:18:11.060 --> 00:18:13.380
 down natural skulls, isn't it, in different places?

00:18:13.380 --> 00:18:15.460
 - If you get a pistachio nut, you know how they're like

00:18:15.460 --> 00:18:17.460
 slightly open on one end,

00:18:17.460 --> 00:18:20.060
 if you just squeeze the slightly open end,

00:18:20.060 --> 00:18:23.140
 then the lever mechanism will open the other end

00:18:23.140 --> 00:18:25.980
 and you can just pull the top shell off

00:18:25.980 --> 00:18:28.620
 and then just get to the inside without kind of pressure.

00:18:28.620 --> 00:18:29.980
 - Are you sure that actually works?

00:18:29.980 --> 00:18:30.820
 - Yeah, I do. - Does it?

00:18:30.820 --> 00:18:31.660
 - Yeah. - Really?

00:18:31.660 --> 00:18:32.740
 - You would have been fired by Richard King

00:18:32.740 --> 00:18:35.860
 immediately when you handed in your sound effects.

00:18:35.860 --> 00:18:37.780
 - What the fuck is this, James?

00:18:37.780 --> 00:18:39.140
 - What I'm just thinking is,

00:18:39.140 --> 00:18:41.860
 when you watch actual tennis, right,

00:18:41.860 --> 00:18:44.220
 someone does a serve and you hear the noise

00:18:44.220 --> 00:18:46.460
 of the serve and it's quite,

00:18:46.460 --> 00:18:49.740
 you know, you would know that noise if you heard it, right?

00:18:49.740 --> 00:18:53.420
 But I remember reading that sometimes in sports, on TV,

00:18:53.420 --> 00:18:55.860
 they add the sounds in later, right?

00:18:55.860 --> 00:18:56.900
 I don't know if this is true,

00:18:56.900 --> 00:19:01.020
 but I remember reading that when a dart hits a dartboard,

00:19:01.020 --> 00:19:03.260
 if you imagine yourself playing darts,

00:19:03.260 --> 00:19:05.780
 they don't make that "foof" when it hits it, right?

00:19:05.780 --> 00:19:06.980
 But then some people do that.

00:19:06.980 --> 00:19:10.500
 And I remember reading that in horse racing,

00:19:10.500 --> 00:19:12.660
 there's no microphones on the far side,

00:19:12.660 --> 00:19:14.780
 so there's no way you could make that sound.

00:19:14.780 --> 00:19:16.900
 So I thought that they use "Wilder Beast."

00:19:16.900 --> 00:19:18.340
 - They do. - That's crazy.

00:19:18.340 --> 00:19:19.620
 - They absolutely, they play that in.

00:19:19.620 --> 00:19:22.420
 - It's the sound of a stampeding "Wilder Beast."

00:19:22.420 --> 00:19:24.500
 And they play it, they don't play it for the audience

00:19:24.500 --> 00:19:26.180
 in the, you know. - No, obviously live.

00:19:26.180 --> 00:19:27.540
 - On TV. - They play it over TV, yeah.

00:19:27.540 --> 00:19:28.780
 So this is insane.

00:19:28.780 --> 00:19:31.900
 I was reading about a guy called Dennis Baxter,

00:19:31.900 --> 00:19:34.940
 who was the sound designer for the Olympics in 2012.

00:19:34.940 --> 00:19:36.500
 And in fact, multiple Olympic games.

00:19:36.500 --> 00:19:38.020
 And this is exactly the problem, James,

00:19:38.020 --> 00:19:40.060
 because loads of places,

00:19:40.060 --> 00:19:42.060
 they don't have microphones for the whole thing.

00:19:42.060 --> 00:19:44.060
 But they have to add microphones wherever they can,

00:19:44.060 --> 00:19:45.700
 and then sometimes cheat a bit.

00:19:45.700 --> 00:19:47.380
 So for the balance beams,

00:19:47.380 --> 00:19:49.540
 they would put microphones on the beam.

00:19:49.540 --> 00:19:52.340
 So no audience would ever hear the creaking

00:19:52.340 --> 00:19:53.380
 and the movement of the beam. - Yeah, yeah.

00:19:53.380 --> 00:19:54.500
 - But you do on TV.

00:19:54.500 --> 00:19:55.500
 And then for the archery,

00:19:55.500 --> 00:19:57.580
 they had a microphone on the target.

00:19:57.580 --> 00:19:59.780
 They had a microphone next to the archer for the launch.

00:19:59.780 --> 00:20:02.380
 And they also put one in between

00:20:02.380 --> 00:20:04.660
 on the arrow's path to capture the swoosh.

00:20:04.660 --> 00:20:07.100
 - Oh, so that's why they're catching the actual sound there.

00:20:07.100 --> 00:20:08.180
 They're not, 'cause for me,

00:20:08.180 --> 00:20:10.500
 I would probably get like a ruler

00:20:10.500 --> 00:20:13.180
 on the side of a table and then twang it.

00:20:13.180 --> 00:20:15.420
 (all laughing)

00:20:15.420 --> 00:20:16.620
 - That's genius. - Yeah.

00:20:16.620 --> 00:20:18.580
 But you're right, they fake it sometimes.

00:20:18.580 --> 00:20:21.220
 So Dennis Baxter, he did the boat race for a while.

00:20:21.220 --> 00:20:22.940
 - Oh, was this in an interview with him?

00:20:22.940 --> 00:20:24.860
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, I've heard this, amazing.

00:20:24.860 --> 00:20:27.020
 - The boat race, if you're actually in the boats

00:20:27.020 --> 00:20:28.420
 or on the bank, what it sounds like

00:20:28.420 --> 00:20:30.180
 is the engines of the support boats

00:20:30.180 --> 00:20:31.900
 and the helicopters flying overhead.

00:20:31.900 --> 00:20:33.100
 And if you play that on TV,

00:20:33.100 --> 00:20:35.500
 it would be an incredibly weird experience.

00:20:35.500 --> 00:20:36.900
 So he went out before the boat race.

00:20:36.900 --> 00:20:39.940
 He recorded clean swishing rowing sounds.

00:20:39.940 --> 00:20:41.140
 And that's what you're hearing.

00:20:41.140 --> 00:20:42.700
 You're hearing Dennis Baxter rowing

00:20:42.700 --> 00:20:44.340
 or someone being recorded live. - Well, he cheated.

00:20:44.340 --> 00:20:45.500
 That's amazing. - Yeah, yeah.

00:20:45.500 --> 00:20:46.340
 - How cool is that?

00:20:46.340 --> 00:20:47.460
 - And it is the tennis as well.

00:20:47.460 --> 00:20:49.860
 It's a really precise job working out

00:20:49.860 --> 00:20:53.180
 when to up the volume of the ball hitting sound

00:20:53.180 --> 00:20:54.180
 and when to decrease it.

00:20:54.180 --> 00:20:55.940
 And it depends completely on the tension

00:20:55.940 --> 00:20:57.540
 and also the crowd sound.

00:20:57.540 --> 00:20:59.780
 And I think he does ground sounds as well.

00:20:59.780 --> 00:21:02.140
 And yeah, he talks about you have to sense

00:21:02.140 --> 00:21:05.020
 how tense a moment it is and then reduce the crowd sound

00:21:05.020 --> 00:21:07.780
 or sense that everyone's getting really excited

00:21:07.780 --> 00:21:09.220
 and then you bring up the crowd sound

00:21:09.220 --> 00:21:11.300
 and then you make the sound of the tennis ball

00:21:11.300 --> 00:21:13.580
 hitting the ground a bit less, the crowd a bit higher.

00:21:13.580 --> 00:21:15.380
 - Is there someone doing the moaning as well?

00:21:15.380 --> 00:21:16.700
 (laughing)

00:21:16.700 --> 00:21:17.820
 - That's his wife actually.

00:21:17.820 --> 00:21:20.080
 (laughing)

00:21:20.080 --> 00:21:24.220
 - I was reading about Foley

00:21:24.220 --> 00:21:27.580
 and there was actually a film made about Foley art itself

00:21:27.580 --> 00:21:30.340
 and it's called Burberry and Sound Studio.

00:21:30.340 --> 00:21:32.260
 It was a horror film that was made in about 2012.

00:21:32.260 --> 00:21:34.020
 It had some famous actors in it.

00:21:34.020 --> 00:21:35.020
 It was meant to be okay.

00:21:35.020 --> 00:21:37.100
 Anyway, it was partly about Foley art.

00:21:37.100 --> 00:21:40.260
 So the main character is working in a movie studio

00:21:40.260 --> 00:21:41.700
 and he's coming up with sound effects.

00:21:41.700 --> 00:21:44.260
 And in this film, he has to come up with the sound effects

00:21:44.260 --> 00:21:46.380
 for these really gory horror scenes.

00:21:46.380 --> 00:21:47.980
 And he has to come up with these sound effects

00:21:47.980 --> 00:21:51.260
 by smashing up pieces of fruit, the classic.

00:21:51.260 --> 00:21:52.700
 So he's shown in this film,

00:21:52.700 --> 00:21:55.660
 smashing up watermelons or mangoes or whatever it takes.

00:21:55.660 --> 00:21:57.900
 But they realized when making this film

00:21:57.900 --> 00:21:59.980
 that the sound of fruit smashing up,

00:21:59.980 --> 00:22:02.320
 it does not actually sound enough

00:22:02.320 --> 00:22:04.100
 like the sound of fruit smashing up.

00:22:04.100 --> 00:22:05.860
 - So they had to find some skulls

00:22:05.860 --> 00:22:08.400
 and break them in, didn't they?

00:22:08.400 --> 00:22:10.460
 - They couldn't get the skulls,

00:22:10.460 --> 00:22:12.780
 but the sound of the fruit smashing up is made

00:22:12.780 --> 00:22:16.940
 with pieces of wet cloth and bits of wood being bashed around.

00:22:16.940 --> 00:22:17.780
 - That's amazing.

00:22:17.780 --> 00:22:18.620
 - That's so funny.

00:22:18.620 --> 00:22:20.260
 - How better is that?

00:22:20.260 --> 00:22:24.060
 - We keep saying Jack Foley was a real person as well.

00:22:24.060 --> 00:22:25.900
 This was the person who created the idea

00:22:25.900 --> 00:22:28.900
 that you could overdub within the sort of

00:22:28.900 --> 00:22:31.300
 behind the scenes of the movie, the post-production.

00:22:31.300 --> 00:22:34.260
 And his first job when he did it was he was working

00:22:34.260 --> 00:22:37.460
 on a movie which was showboat.

00:22:37.460 --> 00:22:40.900
 And his first, I think one of his first things

00:22:40.900 --> 00:22:43.700
 that he did for it was he walked as three people.

00:22:43.700 --> 00:22:46.300
 So he had a cane and he had his own footsteps

00:22:46.300 --> 00:22:48.140
 and he managed to match the footsteps

00:22:48.140 --> 00:22:51.700
 of three people walking using both just his feet and a cane.

00:22:51.700 --> 00:22:53.940
 And that was the moment when they went, oh my God,

00:22:53.940 --> 00:22:55.020
 this is, what is this?

00:22:55.020 --> 00:22:56.980
 And he started experimenting more of it.

00:22:56.980 --> 00:22:58.620
 - Was it three one-legged people?

00:22:58.620 --> 00:23:01.140
 - No, I guess you can move your feet quite fast

00:23:01.140 --> 00:23:04.060
 to be in time with all of the feet, can't you?

00:23:04.060 --> 00:23:06.140
 - So did he get people to close their eyes

00:23:06.140 --> 00:23:09.660
 and say three people are gonna come in and out of this room

00:23:09.660 --> 00:23:14.660
 and then did the three gates and then said it was all me?

00:23:14.660 --> 00:23:16.180
 - Oh, I see.

00:23:16.180 --> 00:23:17.700
 No, I think he just showed them the product

00:23:17.700 --> 00:23:19.300
 of the recording, matched with the film.

00:23:19.300 --> 00:23:23.180
 - He could have been an incredible master criminal, you know.

00:23:23.180 --> 00:23:25.660
 - Make it look like a burglary was five people,

00:23:25.660 --> 00:23:26.500
 but actually it was one.

00:23:26.500 --> 00:23:29.340
 - Make it sound like a burglary was five people, you know?

00:23:29.340 --> 00:23:30.180
 - That's true.

00:23:30.180 --> 00:23:32.060
 - He's no good with an eyewitness.

00:23:32.060 --> 00:23:34.740
 - No, he could only operate under conditions

00:23:34.740 --> 00:23:37.260
 of pitch black darkness.

00:23:37.260 --> 00:23:40.660
 But they would, you know, afterwards the security guard

00:23:40.660 --> 00:23:41.500
 who'd been blindfolded.

00:23:41.500 --> 00:23:42.940
 - He could rob spec savers.

00:23:42.940 --> 00:23:44.140
 - Exactly.

00:23:44.140 --> 00:23:46.100
 Again, everyone would have to be blindfolded

00:23:46.100 --> 00:23:47.260
 and in the area as well.

00:23:47.260 --> 00:23:49.300
 But then they would say afterwards, oh yeah,

00:23:49.300 --> 00:23:52.180
 15 large-

00:23:52.180 --> 00:23:53.020
 - Will the Beast.

00:23:53.020 --> 00:23:54.500
 - Will the Beast came in to the shop

00:23:54.500 --> 00:23:55.580
 and took all the glasses.

00:23:55.580 --> 00:23:58.100
 - Or herring, we're not sure which.

00:23:58.100 --> 00:23:59.460
 - But he could do them so accurately

00:23:59.460 --> 00:24:01.860
 and then 'cause they'd never look for Jack Foley.

00:24:01.860 --> 00:24:05.140
 - So he died when he was 76 years old

00:24:05.140 --> 00:24:07.300
 and he reckoned he had a long career in movies.

00:24:07.300 --> 00:24:08.620
 - Well, or did he?

00:24:08.620 --> 00:24:10.300
 Did he just make it sound like he died

00:24:10.300 --> 00:24:12.140
 to continue his crime spree?

00:24:12.140 --> 00:24:13.100
 - Good call, yeah.

00:24:13.100 --> 00:24:15.820
 That's a cold case, we don't know.

00:24:15.820 --> 00:24:18.500
 But he reckoned he did 5,000 miles of walking

00:24:18.500 --> 00:24:21.500
 in the time of his career for films.

00:24:21.500 --> 00:24:23.060
 He doesn't say whether or not that was like,

00:24:23.060 --> 00:24:25.620
 I was walking to buy some pistachios

00:24:25.620 --> 00:24:27.500
 or I assume it's the footsteps

00:24:27.500 --> 00:24:28.940
 that have appeared on our screens.

00:24:28.940 --> 00:24:31.580
 - Yeah, I would assume so, I don't know.

00:24:31.580 --> 00:24:34.820
 - But also his voice was on movies.

00:24:34.820 --> 00:24:37.940
 He is responsible for the first ever, we believe,

00:24:37.940 --> 00:24:41.220
 Tarzan Cole, the very first, yeah,

00:24:41.220 --> 00:24:43.740
 Tarzan the Tiger in 1929 was the first movie

00:24:43.740 --> 00:24:44.940
 and it wasn't that though.

00:24:44.940 --> 00:24:45.780
 - Was it not?

00:24:45.780 --> 00:24:48.380
 - No, it was just him going, ee-ah!

00:24:48.380 --> 00:24:51.340
 And that was supposedly Jack Foley.

00:24:51.340 --> 00:24:53.260
 It's sort of a bit lost whether or not it was him

00:24:53.260 --> 00:24:55.260
 because I think the footage itself has been lost.

00:24:55.260 --> 00:24:56.460
 It's one of those lost films.

00:24:56.460 --> 00:24:59.820
 Cole, the one that we know that goes, ee-ah!

00:24:59.820 --> 00:25:01.500
 It's like a palindrome, isn't it?

00:25:01.500 --> 00:25:03.220
 That's the fun facts about that.

00:25:03.220 --> 00:25:04.300
 - And it's trademarked.

00:25:04.300 --> 00:25:07.140
 It's owned by the Edgar Rice Burrows family

00:25:07.140 --> 00:25:10.020
 and they've got the exact, it's like nine calls

00:25:10.020 --> 00:25:11.220
 or 10 calls, isn't it?

00:25:11.220 --> 00:25:12.260
 And it's an exhale in it.

00:25:12.260 --> 00:25:13.700
 - Well, after Tenet and Tennis,

00:25:13.700 --> 00:25:16.620
 Richard King can do Tarzan next, yeah.

00:25:16.620 --> 00:25:18.620
 - The film just about the Tarzan Cole.

00:25:18.620 --> 00:25:20.780
 How would you, what would the title of that film be?

00:25:20.780 --> 00:25:22.460
 - If it was just about the Cole.

00:25:22.460 --> 00:25:25.460
 (all laughing)

00:25:25.460 --> 00:25:27.460
 - I was just wondering how you'd spell the film name.

00:25:27.460 --> 00:25:29.340
 (all laughing)

00:25:29.340 --> 00:25:30.180
 Just goes away.

00:25:30.180 --> 00:25:33.860
 - R-E-R-E-R-E-R, I think.

00:25:33.860 --> 00:25:35.220
 (all laughing)

00:25:35.220 --> 00:25:36.820
 - You'd think it was a hospital drama.

00:25:36.820 --> 00:25:37.980
 - Right, right, right, right.

00:25:37.980 --> 00:25:41.140
 (all laughing)

00:25:41.140 --> 00:25:43.980
 - Should we talk about the William sisters?

00:25:43.980 --> 00:25:44.820
 - Yeah.

00:25:44.820 --> 00:25:47.380
 - So this movie, King Richard,

00:25:47.380 --> 00:25:49.860
 the King Richard in the title is the father

00:25:49.860 --> 00:25:51.580
 of Venus and Serena Williams.

00:25:51.580 --> 00:25:54.540
 And he, I don't think it gives anything away

00:25:54.540 --> 00:25:57.900
 for the movie to say he was a very hot housing father

00:25:57.900 --> 00:26:02.020
 who really wanted his children to be tennis players

00:26:02.020 --> 00:26:03.500
 at a very, very young age.

00:26:03.500 --> 00:26:05.100
 He'd never had any training,

00:26:05.100 --> 00:26:08.260
 but he taught them how to become great tennis players

00:26:08.260 --> 00:26:10.580
 and they were the greatest of all time.

00:26:10.580 --> 00:26:13.980
 I read an interview with Venus from 1991.

00:26:13.980 --> 00:26:15.820
 This was in Sports Illustrated.

00:26:15.820 --> 00:26:18.380
 And even then she knew she wanted to be a tennis player.

00:26:18.380 --> 00:26:19.700
 She was a brilliant tennis player.

00:26:19.700 --> 00:26:21.340
 They said, "What would you like to be when you grow up?"

00:26:21.340 --> 00:26:23.420
 She's like, "I want to be a tennis player."

00:26:23.420 --> 00:26:27.620
 Or an archeologist or an astronaut who travels to Jupiter.

00:26:27.620 --> 00:26:28.460
 - Cool.

00:26:28.460 --> 00:26:29.300
 - Wow.

00:26:29.300 --> 00:26:32.220
 - That was her three possible things she wanted to be.

00:26:32.220 --> 00:26:33.900
 And I looked it up 'cause I wondered,

00:26:33.900 --> 00:26:36.900
 and this is true, both Venus and Serena

00:26:36.900 --> 00:26:40.580
 have now owned properties in the town of Jupiter, Florida.

00:26:40.580 --> 00:26:41.420
 - No.

00:26:41.420 --> 00:26:42.260
 - So they kind of went,

00:26:42.260 --> 00:26:43.860
 'cause a lot of sports people live in Jupiter,

00:26:43.860 --> 00:26:45.140
 so, and they, yeah.

00:26:45.140 --> 00:26:45.980
 - Very nice.

00:26:45.980 --> 00:26:46.820
 - That's great.

00:26:46.820 --> 00:26:47.740
 - Isn't that the Jupiter she meant

00:26:47.740 --> 00:26:49.220
 when she was five years old, is it?

00:26:49.220 --> 00:26:50.780
 (all laughing)

00:26:50.780 --> 00:26:51.900
 Just happens to be an astronaut,

00:26:51.900 --> 00:26:52.740
 but living in a tennis place.

00:26:52.740 --> 00:26:53.580
 - That's amazing.

00:26:53.580 --> 00:26:56.500
 - Venus Williams, one of the two Williams sisters.

00:26:56.500 --> 00:26:57.340
 - That's right.

00:26:57.340 --> 00:26:59.100
 - Owns a quarter of a dolphin.

00:26:59.100 --> 00:27:00.620
 (all laughing)

00:27:00.620 --> 00:27:01.620
 - A Miami dolphin?

00:27:01.620 --> 00:27:03.700
 - A Miami dolphin, the American football team.

00:27:03.700 --> 00:27:06.180
 She has a stake in the Miami dolphins,

00:27:06.180 --> 00:27:07.180
 and it's quite a small stake.

00:27:07.180 --> 00:27:08.740
 - With Serena?

00:27:08.740 --> 00:27:11.900
 - Yeah, but I think, so it's about,

00:27:11.900 --> 00:27:14.700
 it's less than 1% that they own or that she owns.

00:27:14.700 --> 00:27:17.180
 But anyway, if you include all the spare players

00:27:17.180 --> 00:27:18.540
 they would have, it would work out

00:27:18.540 --> 00:27:20.500
 at one quarter of one dolphin.

00:27:20.500 --> 00:27:21.340
 - Amazing.

00:27:21.340 --> 00:27:22.180
 - Wow.

00:27:22.180 --> 00:27:23.020
 (all laughing)

00:27:23.020 --> 00:27:25.020
 - Wait, and it's both of them that own it then, is it?

00:27:25.020 --> 00:27:26.780
 - It's quite hard to find the exact chapter of verse

00:27:26.780 --> 00:27:28.940
 on how much they own or whether they own it together.

00:27:28.940 --> 00:27:29.980
 - You can understand why that hasn't been

00:27:29.980 --> 00:27:31.860
 too extensively reported on, I guess,

00:27:31.860 --> 00:27:34.100
 with all the stuff out there about the Williams sisters.

00:27:34.100 --> 00:27:35.940
 (all laughing)

00:27:35.940 --> 00:27:38.860
 In 1995, Serena was 14,

00:27:38.860 --> 00:27:41.820
 and she wanted to go pro,

00:27:41.820 --> 00:27:43.580
 and she was too young by the rules.

00:27:43.580 --> 00:27:45.580
 And so she filed a lawsuit,

00:27:45.580 --> 00:27:49.300
 an antitrust lawsuit against the WTA, I think.

00:27:49.300 --> 00:27:50.140
 - Really?

00:27:50.140 --> 00:27:51.140
 - Saying I should be able to play.

00:27:51.140 --> 00:27:54.060
 And actually, their dad had a bit of a vault vass

00:27:54.060 --> 00:27:56.660
 in their early teens because he suddenly realized

00:27:56.660 --> 00:27:58.220
 that tennis can really screw you up.

00:27:58.220 --> 00:28:00.540
 And the junior tennis circuit,

00:28:00.540 --> 00:28:02.460
 all the parents were just awful.

00:28:02.460 --> 00:28:04.180
 There was a little bit of racism around.

00:28:04.180 --> 00:28:06.100
 And he actually said to, I think Venus,

00:28:06.100 --> 00:28:07.540
 I don't think you should become a tennis player.

00:28:07.540 --> 00:28:08.940
 But she must have thought, well, thanks a lot, dad.

00:28:08.940 --> 00:28:09.780
 (all laughing)

00:28:09.780 --> 00:28:11.540
 I don't think even nothing else for 12 years.

00:28:11.540 --> 00:28:13.220
 (all laughing)

00:28:13.220 --> 00:28:15.020
 But yeah, Serena tries to do this lawsuit

00:28:15.020 --> 00:28:16.780
 to say that you have to let me in, even though I'm 14.

00:28:16.780 --> 00:28:18.420
 - So that was Serena was it?

00:28:18.420 --> 00:28:19.980
 - Sorry, Serena did this lawsuit thing.

00:28:19.980 --> 00:28:24.500
 - So at that stage, Venus will have already become pro, right?

00:28:24.500 --> 00:28:26.820
 So maybe that was the reason, because yeah, in the movie,

00:28:26.820 --> 00:28:30.060
 a lot of it is about how he doesn't want them to become pros.

00:28:30.060 --> 00:28:31.940
 He doesn't, he don't want them to play any matches

00:28:31.940 --> 00:28:33.980
 until they become professional, really.

00:28:33.980 --> 00:28:35.460
 They play when they're like 10 years old

00:28:35.460 --> 00:28:37.340
 and then they don't play again until they're professional.

00:28:37.340 --> 00:28:38.700
 - Except they play with him, don't they?

00:28:38.700 --> 00:28:39.540
 - Well, they were a lot of practice.

00:28:39.540 --> 00:28:40.380
 - Practice, yeah.

00:28:40.380 --> 00:28:42.380
 (all laughing)

00:28:42.380 --> 00:28:44.580
 - They never touched a rocket again.

00:28:44.580 --> 00:28:46.740
 - But how do you go pro without going up a system

00:28:46.740 --> 00:28:47.580
 to get to the pro?

00:28:47.580 --> 00:28:49.060
 - Well, they were so good.

00:28:49.060 --> 00:28:53.380
 They basically had a pro, they had a trainer

00:28:53.380 --> 00:28:54.620
 and they were really, really good.

00:28:54.620 --> 00:28:56.340
 And there was one game,

00:28:56.340 --> 00:28:57.900
 one of her first ever games, Venus,

00:28:57.900 --> 00:28:59.980
 she lost against the Rancho Sanchez Vicario,

00:28:59.980 --> 00:29:01.380
 and this is part of the movie.

00:29:01.380 --> 00:29:04.220
 And they kind of slightly changed what happened in the movie.

00:29:04.220 --> 00:29:06.260
 But anyway, she lost this game

00:29:06.260 --> 00:29:08.180
 and then they interviewed her afterwards and said,

00:29:08.180 --> 00:29:10.420
 "Well, you know, how is this loss

00:29:10.420 --> 00:29:12.300
 against one of the best players in the world?

00:29:12.300 --> 00:29:13.820
 How's it compared to the other times

00:29:13.820 --> 00:29:14.980
 when you've lost in other games?"

00:29:14.980 --> 00:29:16.860
 And she went, "Well, I've never lost before."

00:29:16.860 --> 00:29:18.500
 (all laughing)

00:29:18.500 --> 00:29:21.140
 She'd never lost a match in any of her junior things.

00:29:21.140 --> 00:29:23.660
 And then she stopped playing and then she became pro.

00:29:23.660 --> 00:29:25.580
 And so, yeah, she'd never ever lost a match

00:29:25.580 --> 00:29:26.420
 before at that stage.

00:29:26.420 --> 00:29:27.340
 - Amazing.

00:29:27.340 --> 00:29:29.060
 Yeah, so Richard, the dad,

00:29:29.060 --> 00:29:32.300
 he basically decided that he was gonna turn his two girls.

00:29:32.300 --> 00:29:33.300
 And he had a family before.

00:29:33.300 --> 00:29:34.700
 This was his second marriage

00:29:34.700 --> 00:29:37.460
 and two new kids to the family.

00:29:37.460 --> 00:29:39.220
 He was watching TV and he saw that a tennis player

00:29:39.220 --> 00:29:40.740
 could earn $40,000 a week.

00:29:40.740 --> 00:29:42.300
 And he thought, "My God, that sounds amazing.

00:29:42.300 --> 00:29:44.260
 I'm gonna train my girls up to do that."

00:29:44.260 --> 00:29:46.940
 And he wrote up the 78-page training manual

00:29:46.940 --> 00:29:49.740
 for Serena and Venus that he had everything

00:29:49.740 --> 00:29:52.580
 that he'd learned in there and how he needed them to be.

00:29:52.580 --> 00:29:54.140
 He did a really interesting thing.

00:29:54.140 --> 00:29:56.740
 And I say interesting, it's terrible.

00:29:56.740 --> 00:29:59.900
 He had his kids play Venus and Serena out in the public

00:29:59.900 --> 00:30:03.340
 and he would pay local kids to come and jeer at them,

00:30:03.340 --> 00:30:04.860
 to yell at them as they were playing

00:30:04.860 --> 00:30:06.900
 so that they could get used to the idea of crowds

00:30:06.900 --> 00:30:09.780
 being against them and having to push through it.

00:30:09.780 --> 00:30:12.060
 So there are people out there right now

00:30:12.060 --> 00:30:15.900
 who have an anecdote, which is I was paid as a child

00:30:15.900 --> 00:30:17.700
 to jeer at Serena.

00:30:17.700 --> 00:30:22.940
 I think my family might have been doing that at fish gigs.

00:30:22.940 --> 00:30:24.340
 - What kind of prodigy were they attempting

00:30:24.340 --> 00:30:26.220
 to turn you into and where did it go wrong?

00:30:26.220 --> 00:30:36.060
 - Okay, it is time for fact number three and that is James.

00:30:36.060 --> 00:30:39.340
 - Okay, my fact this week is that there is a tree in Pakistan

00:30:39.340 --> 00:30:43.220
 that has been under arrest for more than 120 years.

00:30:44.860 --> 00:30:46.380
 - And still no charges brought?

00:30:46.380 --> 00:30:50.220
 - No, that's Tony Blair levels of, you know,

00:30:50.220 --> 00:30:51.300
 what's it called?

00:30:51.300 --> 00:30:53.740
 The thing that Tony Blair did with habeas corpus suspension.

00:30:53.740 --> 00:30:55.820
 - That is such an obscure reference

00:30:55.820 --> 00:30:58.300
 to Blair era home office policy.

00:30:58.300 --> 00:30:59.620
 - Guys, we all remember it.

00:30:59.620 --> 00:31:00.460
 - Oh, sorry.

00:31:00.460 --> 00:31:01.300
 - And they're all still outraged.

00:31:01.300 --> 00:31:02.140
 - Yep, sorry.

00:31:02.140 --> 00:31:07.180
 - Anyway, yes, apparently no habeas corpus

00:31:07.180 --> 00:31:09.940
 when it comes to trees in Pakistan.

00:31:09.940 --> 00:31:12.460
 This is, well, is this true?

00:31:12.460 --> 00:31:14.620
 I mean, there is a tree.

00:31:14.620 --> 00:31:18.380
 There's a tree in Pakistan that is undoubtedly true.

00:31:18.380 --> 00:31:20.300
 It's a Banyan tree.

00:31:20.300 --> 00:31:23.700
 It's undoubtedly true that the tree is chained up.

00:31:23.700 --> 00:31:25.580
 And it's undoubtedly true that there is a board

00:31:25.580 --> 00:31:28.260
 on the tree that says I am under arrest.

00:31:28.260 --> 00:31:30.860
 One evening a British officer heavily drunk

00:31:30.860 --> 00:31:33.540
 thought I was moving from my original location

00:31:33.540 --> 00:31:35.980
 and ordered mess sergeant to arrest me.

00:31:35.980 --> 00:31:38.540
 And since then I am under arrest.

00:31:38.540 --> 00:31:40.220
 All that is true.

00:31:40.220 --> 00:31:43.140
 This officer is supposedly called James Squid.

00:31:43.140 --> 00:31:45.380
 I have no evidence that there was ever anyone

00:31:45.380 --> 00:31:46.220
 called James Squid.

00:31:46.220 --> 00:31:47.060
 - I looked as well.

00:31:47.060 --> 00:31:47.900
 I couldn't find any.

00:31:47.900 --> 00:31:49.260
 - Nothing in the newspaper archives,

00:31:49.260 --> 00:31:51.940
 nothing in old books, nothing.

00:31:51.940 --> 00:31:55.940
 - Also, it just feels like Squid wasn't anyone's surname.

00:31:55.940 --> 00:31:57.380
 - Well, it is.

00:31:57.380 --> 00:31:58.900
 There are people called Squid.

00:31:58.900 --> 00:32:00.900
 I looked on one of those genealogy websites

00:32:00.900 --> 00:32:01.780
 where you can see families.

00:32:01.780 --> 00:32:03.940
 Squid was a surname back in the day,

00:32:03.940 --> 00:32:05.260
 but there's no notable Squids.

00:32:05.260 --> 00:32:07.180
 If you go to Wikipedia, notable Squids.

00:32:07.180 --> 00:32:08.340
 - Notable Squids, empty page.

00:32:08.340 --> 00:32:09.180
 - Empty page.

00:32:09.180 --> 00:32:11.620
 - Wow, sorted out the Squids.

00:32:11.620 --> 00:32:13.460
 - Jimmy Wales.

00:32:13.460 --> 00:32:17.020
 - Well, he's only interested in the larger marine levels.

00:32:17.020 --> 00:32:18.020
 - Wow, James Squid.

00:32:18.020 --> 00:32:20.020
 - And this is a thing that certainly the people

00:32:20.020 --> 00:32:21.700
 who live in the Landikatal,

00:32:21.700 --> 00:32:23.780
 which is the place where this tree is,

00:32:23.780 --> 00:32:26.860
 which is in the Khyber region of northern Pakistan

00:32:26.860 --> 00:32:28.420
 near the border with Afghanistan,

00:32:28.420 --> 00:32:30.740
 the people there, it's the story,

00:32:30.740 --> 00:32:32.540
 the local story is that this happened.

00:32:32.540 --> 00:32:34.900
 And I think one reason possibly that it's still there

00:32:34.900 --> 00:32:39.300
 is they wanted to remind people of the colonial times

00:32:39.300 --> 00:32:42.540
 and the bad things that the British colonists

00:32:42.540 --> 00:32:43.580
 brought to the area.

00:32:43.580 --> 00:32:45.140
 And yeah, remember the bad times.

00:32:45.140 --> 00:32:45.980
 - I've got a question.

00:32:45.980 --> 00:32:46.820
 - Yeah.

00:32:46.820 --> 00:32:49.340
 - What's it chained to?

00:32:49.340 --> 00:32:50.180
 - The ground.

00:32:50.180 --> 00:32:51.020
 - The ground, I see.

00:32:51.020 --> 00:32:52.980
 And the reason it's changed to the ground

00:32:52.980 --> 00:32:55.620
 is because so that it can't run away.

00:32:55.620 --> 00:32:57.580
 Because the reason James Squid had it arrested

00:32:57.580 --> 00:33:00.620
 is while he was riding home one night, it leapt at him.

00:33:00.620 --> 00:33:02.660
 It made a sudden movement.

00:33:02.660 --> 00:33:03.700
 And he's like, whoa there.

00:33:03.700 --> 00:33:05.340
 - It was quite a windy night, wasn't it?

00:33:05.340 --> 00:33:07.340
 (laughing)

00:33:07.340 --> 00:33:09.820
 - So he claims drunkenly, supposedly drunkenly.

00:33:09.820 --> 00:33:12.940
 And I say supposedly it's about a possible fictional human.

00:33:12.940 --> 00:33:14.700
 It's a possible fictional human.

00:33:14.700 --> 00:33:17.620
 - We don't even believe the fictional human's drunk story.

00:33:17.620 --> 00:33:19.460
 - It sounds like James Squid has a lot of questions

00:33:19.460 --> 00:33:22.060
 to answer himself, but can't answer them.

00:33:22.060 --> 00:33:23.260
 - Yeah, it's said to have.

00:33:23.260 --> 00:33:25.180
 - Well, they can walk, can't they?

00:33:25.180 --> 00:33:26.020
 - They can.

00:33:26.020 --> 00:33:28.620
 - So, and they do walk quite slowly.

00:33:28.620 --> 00:33:30.380
 - Sorry, could we unpack this a bit?

00:33:30.380 --> 00:33:32.700
 - Yeah, so they possibly don't walk fast enough

00:33:32.700 --> 00:33:34.500
 to jump out at you on a dark night,

00:33:34.500 --> 00:33:36.900
 but they are an extraordinary tree.

00:33:36.900 --> 00:33:38.620
 They're known as Strangler Figs,

00:33:38.620 --> 00:33:41.980
 because the way they grow is they start out as a seed

00:33:41.980 --> 00:33:44.060
 that's put out of a bird or whatever,

00:33:44.060 --> 00:33:46.220
 or blown onto the branch of another tree,

00:33:46.220 --> 00:33:49.140
 and then they drop their roots from that branch.

00:33:49.140 --> 00:33:51.820
 - That's the crate, have you guys heard that before?

00:33:51.820 --> 00:33:52.780
 I'd never heard of that.

00:33:52.780 --> 00:33:54.200
 That is extraordinary.

00:33:54.200 --> 00:33:56.940
 It just takes over a tree from the outside.

00:33:56.940 --> 00:33:58.780
 - Yeah, it kills it.

00:33:58.780 --> 00:34:02.880
 - Yes, and then it kills the inner tree.

00:34:02.880 --> 00:34:06.820
 The banyan then becomes what's called a columnar tree.

00:34:06.820 --> 00:34:08.620
 So there's a hollow column in the middle of it

00:34:08.620 --> 00:34:10.140
 where the previous tree was,

00:34:10.140 --> 00:34:11.940
 and then all sorts of animals get to live

00:34:11.940 --> 00:34:13.540
 inside that hollow bit.

00:34:13.540 --> 00:34:15.340
 - It's like the magic faraway tree.

00:34:15.340 --> 00:34:16.180
 - But the walking.

00:34:16.180 --> 00:34:17.180
 - Yeah, what's the walking?

00:34:17.180 --> 00:34:18.340
 I still don't believe they walk.

00:34:18.340 --> 00:34:22.380
 - So the walking is if you've got your original root

00:34:22.380 --> 00:34:25.300
 that's been dropped from the branch of a tree,

00:34:25.300 --> 00:34:28.060
 and that embeds itself, and that's essentially the trunk,

00:34:28.060 --> 00:34:29.660
 and then it's rooted into the ground,

00:34:29.660 --> 00:34:32.420
 and then it grows up again from the roots and it grows out.

00:34:32.420 --> 00:34:34.860
 So you have these things that look like forests

00:34:34.860 --> 00:34:37.300
 of lots of trees that are just one tree

00:34:37.300 --> 00:34:38.860
 because it keeps on growing up from the roots

00:34:38.860 --> 00:34:41.860
 and then dropping roots down again and then going up again.

00:34:41.860 --> 00:34:46.100
 And then often the original trunk will get diseased

00:34:46.100 --> 00:34:47.900
 and have to be removed.

00:34:47.900 --> 00:34:49.580
 And then I say that that's walking

00:34:49.580 --> 00:34:51.100
 because it's lifted up that leg

00:34:51.100 --> 00:34:53.100
 and taken it out of that position

00:34:53.100 --> 00:34:54.340
 and moved it to the next position.

00:34:54.340 --> 00:34:55.420
 - It hasn't moved it to the next position,

00:34:55.420 --> 00:34:56.260
 it's just been removed.

00:34:56.260 --> 00:34:57.620
 It's just died a bit apitated.

00:34:57.620 --> 00:34:58.500
 - But the new trunk.

00:34:58.500 --> 00:35:00.340
 - It's grown another leg.

00:35:00.340 --> 00:35:01.340
 - The roots that come down,

00:35:01.340 --> 00:35:03.140
 one of those will become the major trunk.

00:35:03.140 --> 00:35:03.980
 - Yes, that's right.

00:35:03.980 --> 00:35:05.380
 I was forgetting that definition of walking

00:35:05.380 --> 00:35:06.900
 where I have my leg apitated,

00:35:06.900 --> 00:35:07.980
 but then I grow a new leg,

00:35:07.980 --> 00:35:10.540
 which I put somewhere slightly different.

00:35:10.540 --> 00:35:13.220
 And then do this a series of times over a century

00:35:13.220 --> 00:35:15.140
 and end up going about 10 feet.

00:35:15.140 --> 00:35:17.420
 Yes, walking, love to go for a walk.

00:35:17.420 --> 00:35:19.540
 (all laughing)

00:35:19.540 --> 00:35:20.500
 - Look, when you're a tree,

00:35:20.500 --> 00:35:22.220
 you have to take everything you get, right?

00:35:22.220 --> 00:35:23.780
 - That's true, that's true.

00:35:23.780 --> 00:35:24.620
 - It's not running.

00:35:24.620 --> 00:35:26.820
 (all laughing)

00:35:26.820 --> 00:35:29.500
 - I saw a massive banyan tree this morning.

00:35:29.500 --> 00:35:30.340
 - Yeah?

00:35:30.340 --> 00:35:31.180
 - It's humongous, it's in India.

00:35:31.180 --> 00:35:32.020
 - How big?

00:35:32.020 --> 00:35:33.980
 - We're talking about 4.7 acres.

00:35:33.980 --> 00:35:35.540
 But this is how big it is,

00:35:35.540 --> 00:35:37.300
 what Anna was mentioning about the idea

00:35:37.300 --> 00:35:39.980
 that these roots grow back out through the ground.

00:35:39.980 --> 00:35:42.500
 So they're called aerial roots.

00:35:42.500 --> 00:35:43.820
 They look like their own trees.

00:35:43.820 --> 00:35:45.900
 This one has 2,800 of them.

00:35:45.900 --> 00:35:47.100
 That's how many it's grown.

00:35:47.100 --> 00:35:49.340
 And the original trunk, like Anna was mentioning

00:35:49.340 --> 00:35:50.220
 about the other one,

00:35:50.220 --> 00:35:52.020
 also has been diseased and chopped away.

00:35:52.020 --> 00:35:54.540
 So even the original leg is no longer there.

00:35:54.540 --> 00:35:55.660
 - They're pretty amazing.

00:35:55.660 --> 00:35:56.900
 They're so big that these trees,

00:35:56.900 --> 00:35:58.540
 these really, really massive ones,

00:35:58.540 --> 00:36:01.060
 I reckon shelter 20,000 people.

00:36:01.060 --> 00:36:02.660
 So let's say it's raining

00:36:02.660 --> 00:36:06.260
 and you're with 19,999 friends

00:36:06.260 --> 00:36:07.300
 and you all need to keep dry.

00:36:07.300 --> 00:36:09.700
 You can just all slip underneath one of these trees.

00:36:09.700 --> 00:36:11.420
 - Or you're Jack Foley.

00:36:11.420 --> 00:36:12.820
 You've just pulled off a job

00:36:12.820 --> 00:36:14.140
 and you need to make it sound like

00:36:14.140 --> 00:36:16.300
 there are 20,000 of you hiding under a tree.

00:36:16.300 --> 00:36:17.580
 (all laughing)

00:36:17.580 --> 00:36:18.780
 Yeah, I understand.

00:36:18.780 --> 00:36:20.100
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:36:20.100 --> 00:36:21.940
 20,000 people though, that is a lot of people.

00:36:21.940 --> 00:36:22.780
 - That's a lot.

00:36:22.780 --> 00:36:25.860
 - If you think of most lower division football stadiums,

00:36:25.860 --> 00:36:27.180
 Tremere Rovers who I support,

00:36:27.180 --> 00:36:28.940
 like that's twice as many,

00:36:28.940 --> 00:36:30.380
 more than twice as many of people

00:36:30.380 --> 00:36:31.820
 who go and watch Tremere every week.

00:36:31.820 --> 00:36:34.220
 - So people could leave Tremere one week

00:36:34.220 --> 00:36:35.500
 and all hide under the same tree

00:36:35.500 --> 00:36:38.100
 and the next week a completely different crowd of fans

00:36:38.100 --> 00:36:40.020
 could turn up, join the initial crowd

00:36:40.020 --> 00:36:40.860
 under the previous tree.

00:36:40.860 --> 00:36:41.700
 - And the other crowd are like,

00:36:41.700 --> 00:36:43.260
 "What was the scar cause we just missed the match

00:36:43.260 --> 00:36:45.500
 cause we're hiding under this tree."

00:36:45.500 --> 00:36:47.660
 - Or in fact, cause I think the biggest one

00:36:47.660 --> 00:36:49.500
 is about three football pitches.

00:36:49.500 --> 00:36:52.340
 So you could all crowd around the outside of the tree

00:36:52.340 --> 00:36:53.820
 and then three teams could play

00:36:53.820 --> 00:36:55.420
 three different matches underneath it.

00:36:55.420 --> 00:36:56.820
 Although there are shed loads of branches in the way

00:36:56.820 --> 00:36:57.980
 so actually that wouldn't work.

00:36:57.980 --> 00:36:59.100
 - Hang on, three football pitches,

00:36:59.100 --> 00:37:01.420
 you can get six teams on there, can't you?

00:37:01.420 --> 00:37:02.620
 - That's such good football knowledge.

00:37:02.620 --> 00:37:03.660
 - I'm not a football expert

00:37:03.660 --> 00:37:06.060
 but I think you can have two teams on the same pitch

00:37:06.060 --> 00:37:07.500
 and it fits a really exciting match.

00:37:07.500 --> 00:37:09.740
 (laughing)

00:37:09.740 --> 00:37:14.820
 - So there's a story that there's a prison

00:37:14.820 --> 00:37:17.980
 in the Shabakodar area

00:37:17.980 --> 00:37:20.220
 and it's called Shabakodar Fort.

00:37:20.220 --> 00:37:22.980
 And in the 1800s, 1840,

00:37:22.980 --> 00:37:24.740
 there was a group of warriors that attacked it

00:37:24.740 --> 00:37:27.020
 and they went inside and there was a big clash

00:37:27.020 --> 00:37:29.340
 and it went on all night long

00:37:29.340 --> 00:37:32.180
 and the Sikh people who were in there fought back

00:37:32.180 --> 00:37:34.260
 and they managed to get them out.

00:37:34.260 --> 00:37:35.700
 But there was this huge thing going,

00:37:35.700 --> 00:37:37.380
 "How the hell did they get in here?

00:37:37.380 --> 00:37:39.980
 "Someone's responsible for this, they need to pay."

00:37:39.980 --> 00:37:42.820
 And so they had a big court case as it were,

00:37:42.820 --> 00:37:46.140
 like a big inquisition into working out who did this.

00:37:46.140 --> 00:37:47.660
 And they came up with a verdict.

00:37:47.660 --> 00:37:49.540
 And the verdict was it was the fault

00:37:49.540 --> 00:37:52.180
 of the wooden doors that let them in.

00:37:52.180 --> 00:37:55.060
 And as a result, the wooden doors have been arrested

00:37:55.060 --> 00:37:56.620
 and have been hanging in the tower,

00:37:56.620 --> 00:38:00.060
 chained up much like this tree ever since the 1840s

00:38:00.060 --> 00:38:01.500
 and they're still chained up.

00:38:01.500 --> 00:38:03.940
 - Wow, that's the scapegoat, isn't it?

00:38:03.940 --> 00:38:05.220
 The scape door. - Yes.

00:38:05.220 --> 00:38:06.780
 - Not the escape door.

00:38:06.780 --> 00:38:09.380
 That's awful if you try and get out through the scape door

00:38:09.380 --> 00:38:11.500
 and you just walk into the door recently.

00:38:11.500 --> 00:38:15.820
 - So wow, this might be a thing,

00:38:15.820 --> 00:38:20.300
 like a trend of chaining up trees or wood.

00:38:20.300 --> 00:38:21.140
 - Yes.

00:38:21.140 --> 00:38:22.220
 - I've not heard of it happening anywhere else.

00:38:22.220 --> 00:38:25.540
 I did look for arrested trees and you don't find any others.

00:38:25.540 --> 00:38:29.020
 - No, no, and this slightly predates your tree as well

00:38:29.020 --> 00:38:30.420
 by about 40 years or so.

00:38:30.420 --> 00:38:31.860
 - And also these are wooden doors,

00:38:31.860 --> 00:38:33.900
 so they were trees a lot before that.

00:38:33.900 --> 00:38:36.620
 - Yeah, we don't know how old the doors were.

00:38:36.620 --> 00:38:38.300
 - We don't know.

00:38:38.300 --> 00:38:39.260
 - Food for thought.

00:38:39.260 --> 00:38:44.460
 - Do some Banyan trees have bells hanging off them

00:38:44.460 --> 00:38:47.260
 so you can ring the bell to access the spirit

00:38:47.260 --> 00:38:48.100
 at the top of them?

00:38:48.100 --> 00:38:48.940
 - Cool.

00:38:48.940 --> 00:38:52.220
 - What is the spirit, is it a helpful spirit?

00:38:52.220 --> 00:38:53.540
 - Goddess, well they're very sacred.

00:38:53.540 --> 00:38:55.420
 So yeah, it's a positive thing.

00:38:55.420 --> 00:38:56.780
 There's lots of mythology around them

00:38:56.780 --> 00:38:58.620
 'cause they are quite extraordinary trees.

00:38:58.620 --> 00:39:01.180
 They feature quite heavily in Hindu mythology, in fact.

00:39:01.180 --> 00:39:05.420
 I think there's Hindu texts from like 500 BC

00:39:05.420 --> 00:39:08.900
 that say the entire universe is an upside down Banyan tree.

00:39:08.900 --> 00:39:12.860
 And so it's growing from the heavens down to us

00:39:12.860 --> 00:39:14.980
 and then it's leaves a little aphorisms,

00:39:14.980 --> 00:39:16.580
 little bits of wisdom.

00:39:16.580 --> 00:39:20.140
 And there's, I mean, women wrap threads around them,

00:39:20.140 --> 00:39:22.860
 don't they, there's a festival in India.

00:39:22.860 --> 00:39:27.740
 Vat Purnima, which I think means Banyan full moon

00:39:27.740 --> 00:39:30.220
 and married women go for three days

00:39:30.220 --> 00:39:31.140
 and hang out with Banyan trees,

00:39:31.140 --> 00:39:33.100
 wrapping threads around them as a way of--

00:39:33.100 --> 00:39:33.940
 - Why?

00:39:33.940 --> 00:39:35.420
 - 'Cause they love their husband so much.

00:39:35.420 --> 00:39:36.260
 It's pretty gross.

00:39:36.260 --> 00:39:37.980
 - There is, yeah, a lot of it is,

00:39:37.980 --> 00:39:39.680
 it's a bit like, what do you call it,

00:39:39.680 --> 00:39:41.060
 like a Hindu almost, right?

00:39:41.060 --> 00:39:42.780
 'Cause all the women go together.

00:39:42.780 --> 00:39:43.860
 - But a married woman, a Hindu.

00:39:43.860 --> 00:39:45.460
 - But they're only married, yeah.

00:39:45.460 --> 00:39:48.220
 - That's an, I reckon that's the next place

00:39:48.220 --> 00:39:49.740
 for the Hindu market to go.

00:39:49.740 --> 00:39:50.700
 - The Banyan trees?

00:39:50.700 --> 00:39:52.780
 - No, just like married Hindus.

00:39:52.780 --> 00:39:54.940
 I think that could be a huge thing.

00:39:54.940 --> 00:39:56.900
 - So what are you celebrating then?

00:39:56.900 --> 00:39:58.420
 - Getting away from your husband for a bit, probably.

00:39:58.420 --> 00:39:59.260
 - Yeah, nice.

00:39:59.260 --> 00:40:00.260
 - How much you love him?

00:40:00.260 --> 00:40:01.100
 - Oh, sorry, yeah.

00:40:01.100 --> 00:40:02.540
 Well, that's how it's sold,

00:40:02.540 --> 00:40:03.860
 but everyone who goes on it knows

00:40:03.860 --> 00:40:05.180
 we're going for a fun party.

00:40:05.180 --> 00:40:06.660
 - Well, if we love our husband so much,

00:40:06.660 --> 00:40:08.340
 why we go to a strip club in Blackpool?

00:40:08.340 --> 00:40:11.220
 (all laughing)

00:40:11.220 --> 00:40:13.180
 - There's a tree in the middle of it.

00:40:13.180 --> 00:40:14.780
 - Stop tying ribbons to that.

00:40:14.780 --> 00:40:16.460
 (all laughing)

00:40:16.460 --> 00:40:17.460
 - To that guy's trunk.

00:40:17.460 --> 00:40:19.340
 (all laughing)

00:40:19.340 --> 00:40:20.940
 Oh my God, he's got an aerial route.

00:40:20.940 --> 00:40:23.520
 (upbeat music)

00:40:23.520 --> 00:40:29.780
 - Okay, it's time for our final fact of the show.

00:40:29.780 --> 00:40:31.500
 That is Anna.

00:40:31.500 --> 00:40:33.540
 - My fact this week is that Pad Thai

00:40:33.540 --> 00:40:37.580
 was invented as part of a fascist government initiative.

00:40:37.580 --> 00:40:38.900
 - Wow.

00:40:38.900 --> 00:40:40.060
 - And every time you eat it,

00:40:40.060 --> 00:40:41.900
 you are supporting fascism.

00:40:41.900 --> 00:40:42.740
 - Oh, shit.

00:40:42.740 --> 00:40:45.260
 - Yeah, I know, awkward, 'cause it's delicious.

00:40:45.260 --> 00:40:47.220
 - Well, this last time you all had Pad Thai,

00:40:47.220 --> 00:40:49.780
 I reckon that I had it this weekend.

00:40:49.780 --> 00:40:50.620
 - About two weeks ago.

00:40:50.620 --> 00:40:51.460
 - Yeah, same.

00:40:51.460 --> 00:40:52.280
 - Yeah.

00:40:52.280 --> 00:40:53.620
 - I'm not sure I've ever had Pad Thai.

00:40:53.620 --> 00:40:55.580
 - Well, you're very liberal out here.

00:40:55.580 --> 00:40:56.980
 - 'Cause of my principles.

00:40:56.980 --> 00:40:59.820
 (all laughing)

00:40:59.820 --> 00:41:00.940
 - This is an amazing thing.

00:41:00.940 --> 00:41:04.140
 It's from Thailand, hence the name.

00:41:04.140 --> 00:41:06.540
 And it was essentially invented,

00:41:06.540 --> 00:41:09.620
 sort of by the leader of Thailand,

00:41:09.620 --> 00:41:12.900
 a guy called Phoeban, full name Luang Phoeban Songkram.

00:41:12.900 --> 00:41:15.820
 And he was a big populist leader in the 1930s,

00:41:15.820 --> 00:41:19.060
 that era of big populist leaders who became fascists.

00:41:19.060 --> 00:41:19.900
 And so--

00:41:19.900 --> 00:41:21.260
 - Thank God we got out of that era.

00:41:21.260 --> 00:41:22.300
 (all laughing)

00:41:22.300 --> 00:41:23.920
 - Well, indeed.

00:41:23.920 --> 00:41:25.620
 - How times have changed.

00:41:25.620 --> 00:41:30.140
 And he became essentially dictator of Thailand in 1938.

00:41:30.140 --> 00:41:33.160
 And he was very anti-China, a very nationalist,

00:41:33.160 --> 00:41:36.140
 as was the way with sort of fascist-leaning dictators.

00:41:36.140 --> 00:41:39.620
 And he wanted to stamp tiness onto everything

00:41:39.620 --> 00:41:41.380
 and make everything very Thai.

00:41:41.380 --> 00:41:43.420
 There were loads of Chinese people in Thailand at the time.

00:41:43.420 --> 00:41:46.060
 They tended to sell most of the street food, for instance.

00:41:46.060 --> 00:41:48.260
 So all the food had Chinese influences.

00:41:48.260 --> 00:41:51.300
 He wanted to scratch that and create this new dish.

00:41:51.300 --> 00:41:54.020
 And it's not totally clear who invented it.

00:41:54.020 --> 00:41:56.940
 His son claims that it was in their household

00:41:56.940 --> 00:41:58.660
 that it was invented and they used to have it

00:41:58.660 --> 00:41:59.780
 as a family together.

00:41:59.780 --> 00:42:02.500
 Other people say maybe he ran a competition to invent it.

00:42:02.500 --> 00:42:05.380
 But essentially, he published and promoted this recipe

00:42:05.380 --> 00:42:08.940
 for Pad Thai to incorporate lots of nice Thai tweaks

00:42:08.940 --> 00:42:10.500
 and made everyone eat it.

00:42:10.500 --> 00:42:11.340
 - That's interesting.

00:42:11.340 --> 00:42:13.580
 I did read that it's not Thai,

00:42:13.580 --> 00:42:17.500
 that it's a Chinese meal which has been sort of adopted.

00:42:17.500 --> 00:42:18.340
 - Did you see that?

00:42:18.340 --> 00:42:22.260
 - Well, it is because China and Thailand

00:42:22.260 --> 00:42:24.380
 are all kind of noodle or rice-based stuff.

00:42:24.380 --> 00:42:26.380
 It does use Chinese noodles.

00:42:26.380 --> 00:42:28.940
 It basically took Chinese noodle dishes

00:42:28.940 --> 00:42:30.780
 and added lots of tiness to it.

00:42:30.780 --> 00:42:34.300
 So the Thai bits are things like the palm sugar,

00:42:34.300 --> 00:42:35.860
 that real nice sweet sugariness,

00:42:35.860 --> 00:42:37.860
 the chili tamarind flavor that you get.

00:42:37.860 --> 00:42:38.700
 That was all Thai.

00:42:38.700 --> 00:42:40.140
 - Also, bean sprouts, you don't really,

00:42:40.140 --> 00:42:42.780
 is very Thai, which is on top.

00:42:42.780 --> 00:42:44.340
 - But yeah, it wasn't like a pizza.

00:42:44.340 --> 00:42:45.540
 They had to work with what they had.

00:42:45.540 --> 00:42:48.420
 And what they had was the same ingredients as Chinese food.

00:42:48.420 --> 00:42:51.780
 - Yeah, actually, you were saying about the food vendors,

00:42:51.780 --> 00:42:54.540
 all being Chinese, any foreign food vendors

00:42:54.540 --> 00:42:56.340
 were banned by Phoeban.

00:42:56.340 --> 00:42:57.540
 They said, "You're not allowed to do that."

00:42:57.540 --> 00:43:00.300
 And the government kind of bought a load of food carts

00:43:00.300 --> 00:43:02.900
 and then got people to run them and said,

00:43:02.900 --> 00:43:06.460
 "Right, you've got to sell Pad Thai from these food carts."

00:43:06.460 --> 00:43:09.260
 They made it so that everyone had to eat

00:43:09.260 --> 00:43:10.740
 at certain times every day

00:43:10.740 --> 00:43:13.900
 and you were allowed no more than four meals a day

00:43:13.900 --> 00:43:17.300
 because this was the Thai way as opposed to the Chinese way.

00:43:17.300 --> 00:43:18.140
 You were supposed to--

00:43:18.140 --> 00:43:18.960
 - It's not that rigorous, is it?

00:43:18.960 --> 00:43:22.460
 - How many meals a day?

00:43:22.460 --> 00:43:25.140
 - I was like, "Well, snacks are allowed."

00:43:25.140 --> 00:43:26.980
 - I think that might not be, I don't think so.

00:43:26.980 --> 00:43:29.140
 - I have some pretty hefty snacks.

00:43:29.140 --> 00:43:30.340
 I only have three meals a day,

00:43:30.340 --> 00:43:32.540
 but if you add in snacks, I'm shading snacks.

00:43:32.540 --> 00:43:33.460
 - I think you're not allowed,

00:43:33.460 --> 00:43:36.500
 you wouldn't be allowed in 1930s Thailand.

00:43:36.500 --> 00:43:39.060
 He was the one who changed the name to Thailand from Siam.

00:43:39.060 --> 00:43:39.980
 - Yes.

00:43:39.980 --> 00:43:41.820
 - He mandated that everyone had to sleep

00:43:41.820 --> 00:43:43.620
 six to eight hours a day,

00:43:43.620 --> 00:43:45.300
 which apparently was also a Thai thing

00:43:45.300 --> 00:43:46.420
 as opposed to a Chinese thing.

00:43:46.420 --> 00:43:48.500
 And he said that everyone had to wear hats.

00:43:48.500 --> 00:43:50.740
 - How was the Chinese eating 15 meals a day

00:43:50.740 --> 00:43:51.980
 and sleeping for 21 hours?

00:43:51.980 --> 00:43:53.780
 - It appears that way.

00:43:53.780 --> 00:43:54.900
 - It wasn't even just hats.

00:43:54.900 --> 00:43:56.860
 You had to make sure you wore shoes.

00:43:56.860 --> 00:43:59.740
 If there were photos of people without hats and shoes in them,

00:43:59.740 --> 00:44:02.340
 they were painted on onto the actual photo itself.

00:44:02.340 --> 00:44:03.180
 - Really?

00:44:03.180 --> 00:44:05.260
 - Yeah, all these, he made sure that,

00:44:05.260 --> 00:44:07.060
 and this was an order that you had to kiss.

00:44:07.060 --> 00:44:08.380
 This is if you were a male worker,

00:44:08.380 --> 00:44:11.100
 you had to kiss your wife before you left for work.

00:44:11.100 --> 00:44:12.980
 That was part of the mandate.

00:44:12.980 --> 00:44:15.300
 - I do think that's nice.

00:44:15.300 --> 00:44:18.620
 - If you have to, it takes the meaning off it.

00:44:18.620 --> 00:44:19.460
 - You're absolutely right.

00:44:19.460 --> 00:44:21.620
 - If you go to work and give your wife a kiss

00:44:21.620 --> 00:44:23.420
 and she knows that if you don't do it,

00:44:23.420 --> 00:44:24.420
 you're gonna be arrested.

00:44:24.420 --> 00:44:26.260
 I think it takes a lot of love out there.

00:44:26.260 --> 00:44:27.660
 - And sometimes you've had a tiff

00:44:27.660 --> 00:44:30.260
 and you actually want to make a point.

00:44:30.260 --> 00:44:31.100
 - Yeah.

00:44:31.100 --> 00:44:33.500
 - And you're like, I hate you so much.

00:44:33.500 --> 00:44:34.740
 I'm willing to be arrested

00:44:34.740 --> 00:44:37.220
 by the fascist governments of Thailand.

00:44:37.220 --> 00:44:40.340
 - That actually really makes the point much more effectively.

00:44:40.340 --> 00:44:43.980
 They're just saying, sorry, train, gotta go, gotta go.

00:44:43.980 --> 00:44:45.300
 - Well, the reason we all think it's nice

00:44:45.300 --> 00:44:46.580
 is 'cause we are Westerners

00:44:46.580 --> 00:44:47.900
 and that's why he was trying to--

00:44:47.900 --> 00:44:49.220
 - Oh, he was trying to Westernize.

00:44:49.220 --> 00:44:52.420
 - Yeah, it was just absolutely bang on classic,

00:44:52.420 --> 00:44:54.940
 but like desperately trying to Westernize and modernize,

00:44:54.940 --> 00:44:57.860
 partly because, partly our fault he came about

00:44:57.860 --> 00:45:00.980
 because Thailand or Siam had never been conquered,

00:45:00.980 --> 00:45:03.060
 never really been colonized by the West

00:45:03.060 --> 00:45:04.540
 unlike pretty much everywhere else in that area.

00:45:04.540 --> 00:45:06.620
 - Sounds like it was explicitly not our fault.

00:45:06.620 --> 00:45:07.940
 - No, but wait for it.

00:45:07.940 --> 00:45:08.780
 - Oh, no.

00:45:08.780 --> 00:45:10.380
 It felt like they were in danger of being colonized

00:45:10.380 --> 00:45:12.380
 'cause we weren't over that phase of history at the time

00:45:12.380 --> 00:45:14.140
 and they were like, the reason we haven't been colonized

00:45:14.140 --> 00:45:16.420
 is because we're really cultured, we're civilized,

00:45:16.420 --> 00:45:18.860
 you know, Westerners think that we don't need to be colonized

00:45:18.860 --> 00:45:21.420
 and we need to kind of persuade the West

00:45:21.420 --> 00:45:24.660
 not to invade us by Westernizing and modernizing massively

00:45:24.660 --> 00:45:26.420
 and that's gonna mean kissing our wives

00:45:26.420 --> 00:45:29.780
 and that's why the Brits didn't invade Thailand.

00:45:29.780 --> 00:45:32.180
 We saw they were kissing their wives as they left

00:45:32.180 --> 00:45:34.500
 and that was the idea.

00:45:34.500 --> 00:45:35.780
 - And wearing hats.

00:45:35.780 --> 00:45:37.140
 - And wearing hats, yeah.

00:45:37.140 --> 00:45:38.620
 - Can't possibly arrest all these good chaps

00:45:38.620 --> 00:45:40.660
 who are going around wearing hats and kissing their wives.

00:45:40.660 --> 00:45:41.500
 - Precisely.

00:45:41.500 --> 00:45:42.340
 - Wow.

00:45:42.340 --> 00:45:43.780
 - You've got a British mentality of the 1930s.

00:45:43.780 --> 00:45:45.940
 - Yeah, it's not the first time I've heard that either.

00:45:45.940 --> 00:45:48.620
 - He banned listening to American and European music though.

00:45:48.620 --> 00:45:50.060
 Why would he do that?

00:45:50.060 --> 00:45:53.460
 - Well, again, he wanted to get the Thai culture.

00:45:53.460 --> 00:45:54.780
 - Okay, I guess so.

00:45:54.780 --> 00:45:56.660
 - He ordered every single household

00:45:56.660 --> 00:45:58.380
 to have a picture of him in their homes,

00:45:58.380 --> 00:46:01.860
 classic fascist behavior, that's vintage stuff

00:46:01.860 --> 00:46:04.620
 and also theater and cinema audiences

00:46:04.620 --> 00:46:06.260
 had to bow to an image of him

00:46:06.260 --> 00:46:08.940
 before each viewing of the screening of the film

00:46:08.940 --> 00:46:10.220
 or the performance of the play.

00:46:10.220 --> 00:46:11.060
 - Really?

00:46:11.060 --> 00:46:14.660
 - Oh, well that's fine, 'cause 1930s cinema and theater.

00:46:14.660 --> 00:46:15.620
 - You had to bow to Boris Johnson

00:46:15.620 --> 00:46:17.100
 before you see one man, two governors.

00:46:17.100 --> 00:46:19.820
 - You got to stand up and sing "God Save the Queen"

00:46:19.820 --> 00:46:21.100
 in the cinemas before a movie

00:46:21.100 --> 00:46:23.380
 and at the end of the movie, that's what happened here.

00:46:23.380 --> 00:46:24.740
 Like, it's not any different.

00:46:24.740 --> 00:46:27.020
 - They said that same thing, yeah.

00:46:27.020 --> 00:46:29.740
 He had to use forks and spoons, national cutlery,

00:46:29.740 --> 00:46:31.220
 got rid of chopsticks.

00:46:31.220 --> 00:46:34.260
 Again, it's this weird hybrid of persuading the West

00:46:34.260 --> 00:46:35.660
 that we're Westernized and modern,

00:46:35.660 --> 00:46:37.660
 but also keeping real Tainas.

00:46:37.660 --> 00:46:39.340
 Typhoon with forks and spoons.

00:46:39.340 --> 00:46:41.820
 And also, they went through all these popular songs

00:46:41.820 --> 00:46:44.380
 and they took out, if any popular folk songs

00:46:44.380 --> 00:46:46.740
 mentioned other ethnicities that weren't Thai,

00:46:46.740 --> 00:46:48.220
 they were rewritten.

00:46:48.220 --> 00:46:50.660
 So, if you were Lao or if you were Burmese,

00:46:50.660 --> 00:46:51.740
 'cause there were lots of different ethnicities

00:46:51.740 --> 00:46:55.340
 in Thailand at the time, then couldn't sing it anymore.

00:46:55.340 --> 00:46:56.700
 - Really? - Wow.

00:46:56.700 --> 00:46:59.500
 - So if you had the song "The Irish Rover",

00:46:59.500 --> 00:47:01.420
 did they rewrite it as the Thai Rover?

00:47:01.420 --> 00:47:02.940
 - Yeah, and that was one of the most popular songs

00:47:02.940 --> 00:47:03.780
 at the time.

00:47:03.780 --> 00:47:05.220
 (laughing)

00:47:05.220 --> 00:47:06.500
 - I don't think of any other songs

00:47:06.500 --> 00:47:08.180
 which had an ethnicity of them.

00:47:08.180 --> 00:47:09.180
 - See.

00:47:09.180 --> 00:47:11.980
 - But so, they would send the artist back into the studio.

00:47:11.980 --> 00:47:13.820
 It wouldn't be like the DJ at the radio station

00:47:13.820 --> 00:47:16.180
 would just come in and just say a new word

00:47:16.180 --> 00:47:17.660
 over a song playing.

00:47:17.660 --> 00:47:19.580
 - Well, this is where Andy's Foley Artist comes in,

00:47:19.580 --> 00:47:20.420
 isn't it?

00:47:20.420 --> 00:47:23.380
 They employed Jack Foley to say the word Thai

00:47:23.380 --> 00:47:25.620
 over everything else.

00:47:25.620 --> 00:47:26.900
 - Actually, it doesn't sound like Thai

00:47:26.900 --> 00:47:27.900
 if you say the word Thai.

00:47:27.900 --> 00:47:29.380
 You have to say the word Swiss,

00:47:29.380 --> 00:47:31.900
 because that better creates the sound of the word Thai.

00:47:31.900 --> 00:47:33.700
 (laughing)

00:47:33.700 --> 00:47:35.540
 - Anyway, it was a fascist bad guy.

00:47:35.540 --> 00:47:36.380
 - Yeah.

00:47:36.380 --> 00:47:37.860
 - They had a noodles song as well.

00:47:37.860 --> 00:47:38.700
 - Oh, yeah.

00:47:38.700 --> 00:47:40.620
 - Yeah, yeah, Thai, 'cause it's, do you wanna hear it?

00:47:40.620 --> 00:47:41.460
 - Yes, please.

00:47:41.460 --> 00:47:42.300
 - It sounds so fun.

00:47:42.300 --> 00:47:43.580
 - I love two, three, four.

00:47:43.580 --> 00:47:46.220
 - Noodles, noodles, noodles, it's how it starts.

00:47:46.220 --> 00:47:48.140
 Thai vegetables are wealth in the ground.

00:47:48.140 --> 00:47:49.460
 You can find it anywhere.

00:47:49.460 --> 00:47:51.220
 Keep buying and selling as Thai people

00:47:51.220 --> 00:47:52.180
 always help each other.

00:47:52.180 --> 00:47:53.180
 Noodles, noodles.

00:47:53.180 --> 00:47:55.140
 I imagine something's been lost in translation,

00:47:55.140 --> 00:47:58.260
 but the tune.

00:47:58.260 --> 00:48:00.500
 (laughing)

00:48:00.500 --> 00:48:01.780
 - Do you know we've only just worked out

00:48:01.780 --> 00:48:03.540
 how to break a noodle in half?

00:48:03.540 --> 00:48:04.540
 (laughing)

00:48:04.540 --> 00:48:05.380
 - Not true.

00:48:05.380 --> 00:48:07.860
 - Scientists have, well, okay, 2018.

00:48:07.860 --> 00:48:10.100
 (laughing)

00:48:10.100 --> 00:48:13.540
 Four years ago, this is like a straight noodle

00:48:13.540 --> 00:48:14.540
 or a bit of spaghetti,

00:48:14.540 --> 00:48:17.900
 and it's just impossible to snap it in half

00:48:17.900 --> 00:48:18.740
 if you try doing it.

00:48:18.740 --> 00:48:19.580
 - Oh, yeah.

00:48:19.580 --> 00:48:20.420
 - It's really interesting.

00:48:20.420 --> 00:48:21.260
 If you're at home now,

00:48:21.260 --> 00:48:23.540
 like get a piece of long piece of spaghetti,

00:48:23.540 --> 00:48:24.380
 a long spaghetti.

00:48:24.380 --> 00:48:25.460
 (laughing)

00:48:25.460 --> 00:48:28.340
 You hold both ends of it and then start to bend, right?

00:48:28.340 --> 00:48:29.660
 Until it snaps,

00:48:29.660 --> 00:48:31.860
 you'll find that the two bits in your hand

00:48:31.860 --> 00:48:33.100
 stay in your hand,

00:48:33.100 --> 00:48:35.180
 and then the bit in the middle comes out,

00:48:35.180 --> 00:48:37.260
 so it doesn't break into two pieces.

00:48:37.260 --> 00:48:38.300
 It always breaks into three.

00:48:38.300 --> 00:48:39.140
 It's really interesting.

00:48:39.140 --> 00:48:39.980
 - That is interesting.

00:48:39.980 --> 00:48:41.780
 Although if you hold it in the middle, you can.

00:48:41.780 --> 00:48:42.620
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:48:42.620 --> 00:48:44.540
 - That's what they learned in 2018.

00:48:44.540 --> 00:48:46.860
 (laughing)

00:48:46.860 --> 00:48:47.780
 - Andy, if only you'd been there.

00:48:47.780 --> 00:48:50.340
 I mean, you could have saved thousands of pounds.

00:48:50.340 --> 00:48:51.180
 - Yeah.

00:48:51.180 --> 00:48:52.940
 - So I think I'm a really famous scientist.

00:48:52.940 --> 00:48:54.380
 - Richard Feynman was,

00:48:54.380 --> 00:48:55.740
 he was obsessed with this problem.

00:48:55.740 --> 00:48:58.460
 So he used to stay up all night,

00:48:58.460 --> 00:49:01.380
 repeatedly snapping strands of spaghetti.

00:49:01.380 --> 00:49:04.220
 Incredibly famous physicists, Richard Feynman.

00:49:04.220 --> 00:49:05.780
 - And he died in what, the 80s or 90s,

00:49:05.780 --> 00:49:09.700
 so he never, he's not alive to the graduate.

00:49:09.700 --> 00:49:12.780
 See the 2018 innovation, what happened?

00:49:12.780 --> 00:49:14.380
 - Well, he died clutching a noodle.

00:49:14.380 --> 00:49:17.620
 It flew into his eye and through to his brain.

00:49:17.620 --> 00:49:21.820
 We figured out why you can't do it in 2006,

00:49:21.820 --> 00:49:24.060
 and that's to do with this kickback wave

00:49:24.060 --> 00:49:26.340
 that travels through the spaghetti when you snap it

00:49:26.340 --> 00:49:27.780
 and smashes it up.

00:49:27.780 --> 00:49:30.340
 But it then took another 12 years

00:49:30.340 --> 00:49:31.940
 to figure out how to overcome it.

00:49:31.940 --> 00:49:36.780
 The way you overcome it is you twist the spaghetti 280 degrees.

00:49:36.780 --> 00:49:39.860
 So almost a full all the way around.

00:49:39.860 --> 00:49:43.540
 And then you break it gently, slowly.

00:49:43.540 --> 00:49:45.460
 And that solves your problem.

00:49:45.460 --> 00:49:47.980
 - Yeah, I think if you are at home and you do try that,

00:49:47.980 --> 00:49:50.860
 sometimes you break it and it does go into two

00:49:50.860 --> 00:49:52.340
 and you're really disappointed.

00:49:52.340 --> 00:49:54.620
 But I think that might be because you've got either too much

00:49:54.620 --> 00:49:56.540
 or too little moisture in your spaghetti.

00:49:56.540 --> 00:49:58.540
 - Yeah, if you try it just without the twist.

00:49:58.540 --> 00:49:59.820
 - I'm just saying, don't write it.

00:49:59.820 --> 00:50:02.580
 If you break your spaghetti and it breaks it's too straight away,

00:50:02.580 --> 00:50:03.420
 then don't write it.

00:50:03.420 --> 00:50:05.020
 - It's your fault is what we're saying.

00:50:05.020 --> 00:50:05.980
 Yeah, yeah.

00:50:05.980 --> 00:50:09.260
 So are there any, it feels like a stupid question.

00:50:09.260 --> 00:50:11.060
 Are there any applications for this?

00:50:11.060 --> 00:50:12.460
 - Got loads.

00:50:12.460 --> 00:50:13.300
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:50:13.300 --> 00:50:16.380
 - But that's pretty much time to go through.

00:50:16.380 --> 00:50:20.820
 - Probably military, PAE systems have probably bought it.

00:50:20.820 --> 00:50:23.460
 - You make drones out of a snap spaghetti now, yeah.

00:50:23.460 --> 00:50:25.980
 - Is it the same principle for anything

00:50:25.980 --> 00:50:27.260
 that is one big long stick?

00:50:27.260 --> 00:50:30.980
 As in I'm trying to think of someone doing a pole vote.

00:50:30.980 --> 00:50:31.820
 No, sorry.

00:50:31.820 --> 00:50:32.660
 - A pole vote.

00:50:32.660 --> 00:50:33.500
 - No, no, I think pole.

00:50:33.500 --> 00:50:35.580
 - Yeah, yeah, a vaulting pole.

00:50:35.580 --> 00:50:37.900
 They're at one end and we do see them snap

00:50:37.900 --> 00:50:40.060
 and they tend to snap in two, I think.

00:50:40.060 --> 00:50:40.900
 - Do they snap?

00:50:40.900 --> 00:50:43.340
 - Yeah, they have snapped from time to time.

00:50:43.340 --> 00:50:45.100
 No, I think it's because the spaghetti

00:50:45.100 --> 00:50:47.380
 has got a certain tensile strength that it works,

00:50:47.380 --> 00:50:50.300
 but particularly well with that, I think.

00:50:50.300 --> 00:50:52.900
 - Okay, how about in the last year,

00:50:52.900 --> 00:50:57.900
 a woman was burgled in a helicopter was dispatched

00:50:57.900 --> 00:50:59.100
 to the scene of this burglary.

00:50:59.100 --> 00:51:00.420
 - Yeah, right.

00:51:00.420 --> 00:51:03.700
 - That's a, so it wasn't in Britain then, oh.

00:51:03.700 --> 00:51:04.940
 - No, it was because of police funding.

00:51:04.940 --> 00:51:05.780
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:51:05.780 --> 00:51:07.940
 - Yeah, and the only thing is.

00:51:07.940 --> 00:51:09.820
 - We were allowed to make references to Tony Blair's

00:51:09.820 --> 00:51:11.660
 home office, "Happiest Corpus" policies,

00:51:11.660 --> 00:51:13.620
 but I'm not allowed to comment on police cuts now.

00:51:13.620 --> 00:51:16.220
 - Can you just say how many police cuts

00:51:16.220 --> 00:51:17.700
 do you think you would not have to have

00:51:17.700 --> 00:51:19.540
 before we could get a helicopter

00:51:19.540 --> 00:51:21.660
 going to every burglary that happens?

00:51:21.660 --> 00:51:22.500
 - All I'm saying is, James,

00:51:22.500 --> 00:51:23.340
 this is a stand for election,

00:51:23.340 --> 00:51:25.420
 that's going to be one of my flagship policies,

00:51:25.420 --> 00:51:27.780
 chopper at your house within seven minutes

00:51:27.780 --> 00:51:29.780
 of the burglary happening.

00:51:29.780 --> 00:51:32.620
 - Well this actually, this story does weak

00:51:32.620 --> 00:51:33.940
 of an overfunded police force,

00:51:33.940 --> 00:51:35.380
 because the only things that were stolen

00:51:35.380 --> 00:51:36.780
 were eight pot noodles.

00:51:36.780 --> 00:51:40.420
 Not just individual noodles,

00:51:40.420 --> 00:51:41.660
 pot noodles, but like, you know.

00:51:41.660 --> 00:51:42.820
 - They dispatched a helicopter.

00:51:42.820 --> 00:51:44.860
 - Packets, I don't think they knew at the time

00:51:44.860 --> 00:51:46.580
 that it was just pot noodles that had been taken

00:51:46.580 --> 00:51:47.420
 and women just saw.

00:51:47.420 --> 00:51:49.300
 - Was this woman the queen?

00:51:49.300 --> 00:51:51.300
 - Yeah, she loved.

00:51:51.300 --> 00:51:53.700
 - So we learned earlier that they were using helicopters

00:51:53.700 --> 00:51:55.700
 to lift up pilchards from the water.

00:51:55.700 --> 00:51:57.220
 - Yeah, nutty knower.

00:51:57.220 --> 00:51:58.740
 - So you know, and it's like,

00:51:58.740 --> 00:52:00.060
 - What are you saying, we've got spare helicopters

00:52:00.060 --> 00:52:00.900
 coming out of our ears?

00:52:00.900 --> 00:52:01.740
 - Seems like it.

00:52:01.740 --> 00:52:03.620
 - Yeah, I think she didn't know at the time

00:52:03.620 --> 00:52:05.180
 she just saw this burglar in her garden

00:52:05.180 --> 00:52:06.820
 having leapt out of her house, I guess,

00:52:06.820 --> 00:52:08.340
 called the police, they were like,

00:52:08.340 --> 00:52:09.820
 oh God, emergency.

00:52:09.820 --> 00:52:12.260
 And it was only later when they interviewed her,

00:52:12.260 --> 00:52:13.260
 they said, what's been taken?

00:52:13.260 --> 00:52:15.460
 And she said, well, actually eight pot noodles.

00:52:15.460 --> 00:52:17.180
 And she said they took all the beef

00:52:17.180 --> 00:52:18.420
 and tomato flavored ones,

00:52:18.420 --> 00:52:20.660
 but didn't take the chicken and mushroom ones.

00:52:20.660 --> 00:52:24.380
 - Really, that, yeah, I understand that.

00:52:24.380 --> 00:52:25.860
 - I was going to say, yeah.

00:52:25.860 --> 00:52:29.940
 - Have you heard of Watana Panic?

00:52:29.940 --> 00:52:30.780
 - Say it again.

00:52:30.780 --> 00:52:31.620
 - Watana Panic.

00:52:31.620 --> 00:52:32.460
 - No.

00:52:32.460 --> 00:52:35.140
 - Watana, it's in Thailand.

00:52:35.140 --> 00:52:37.740
 It's a noodle soup joint.

00:52:37.740 --> 00:52:41.180
 Maybe the Watana family, I don't know.

00:52:41.180 --> 00:52:43.740
 But it's a place where you can buy noodle soup

00:52:43.740 --> 00:52:47.060
 and they're one of these places where every day

00:52:47.060 --> 00:52:49.300
 they take the last bit of the previous soup

00:52:49.300 --> 00:52:53.260
 and put it into the next soup, like a perpetual soup.

00:52:53.260 --> 00:52:54.980
 And so whenever you, whatever you buy,

00:52:54.980 --> 00:52:56.900
 if you get some of this beef noodles,

00:52:56.900 --> 00:52:59.460
 you might be having stuff from, you know,

00:52:59.460 --> 00:53:00.740
 50 years ago.

00:53:00.740 --> 00:53:01.580
 Isn't it cool?

00:53:01.580 --> 00:53:02.420
 - That's really cool.

00:53:02.420 --> 00:53:03.540
 - How long it's been going on?

00:53:03.540 --> 00:53:06.260
 - It's been going three generations.

00:53:06.260 --> 00:53:09.340
 We think 45 years and counting.

00:53:09.340 --> 00:53:12.620
 But I was reading about these perpetual soups

00:53:12.620 --> 00:53:14.460
 and there's some claims.

00:53:14.460 --> 00:53:17.900
 One of them apparently, there was,

00:53:17.900 --> 00:53:20.300
 there's one story that there was a perpetual stew

00:53:20.300 --> 00:53:22.300
 in Perpignan in France

00:53:22.300 --> 00:53:25.500
 that was going from the 15th century until World War Two.

00:53:25.500 --> 00:53:28.860
 - What, then the Nazis bombed it?

00:53:28.860 --> 00:53:31.740
 - They ran out of ingredients due to the German occupation

00:53:31.740 --> 00:53:33.820
 and had to stop the stew.

00:53:33.820 --> 00:53:34.860
 - You could just water it.

00:53:34.860 --> 00:53:36.460
 I would have thought you just water it down

00:53:36.460 --> 00:53:38.020
 until it's basically water,

00:53:38.020 --> 00:53:40.580
 but keep the stew technically, it's still the stew.

00:53:40.580 --> 00:53:42.260
 But you've got bigger things on your mind

00:53:42.260 --> 00:53:44.420
 when the Nazis are rolling in, so that's fair enough.

00:53:44.420 --> 00:53:45.260
 - Yeah, you do.

00:53:45.260 --> 00:53:47.420
 There was one in Normandy

00:53:47.420 --> 00:53:49.260
 that apparently was over 300 years old.

00:53:49.260 --> 00:53:50.700
 This is kind of turned,

00:53:50.700 --> 00:53:54.180
 this is an article in a newspaper called The Navhyn Times,

00:53:54.180 --> 00:53:55.340
 which is from Goa.

00:53:55.340 --> 00:53:56.620
 I couldn't find it anywhere else,

00:53:56.620 --> 00:53:58.340
 so God knows if this is true.

00:53:58.340 --> 00:54:00.820
 - They've got an unbelievably good Normandy correspondent.

00:54:00.820 --> 00:54:02.540
 (laughing)

00:54:02.540 --> 00:54:03.820
 - Wait till I tell you why it is,

00:54:03.820 --> 00:54:05.300
 because it's so unlikely.

00:54:05.300 --> 00:54:07.100
 But also, what a weird thing to make up.

00:54:07.100 --> 00:54:08.660
 They said that in Normandy,

00:54:08.660 --> 00:54:12.860
 they had a pot which had been bubbling away

00:54:12.860 --> 00:54:15.100
 for over 300 years.

00:54:15.100 --> 00:54:16.740
 It was in a Cistercian abbey,

00:54:16.740 --> 00:54:19.260
 and researchers went into this soup

00:54:19.260 --> 00:54:20.900
 and like took some tests,

00:54:20.900 --> 00:54:23.540
 and they said that there was still some ingredients

00:54:23.540 --> 00:54:27.860
 in there that had been in the stew for 350 years.

00:54:27.860 --> 00:54:29.100
 - What, James, what you're reading

00:54:29.100 --> 00:54:30.980
 is the Indian equivalent of the daily experience.

00:54:30.980 --> 00:54:32.820
 (laughing)

00:54:32.820 --> 00:54:34.260
 - But it is like that thing, isn't it?

00:54:34.260 --> 00:54:37.020
 Where if you, every glass of water you drink

00:54:37.020 --> 00:54:38.300
 has been through a dinosaur.

00:54:38.300 --> 00:54:39.300
 - Yeah, okay.

00:54:39.300 --> 00:54:40.540
 - Or, and Hitler.

00:54:40.540 --> 00:54:41.500
 - And Hitler, yeah.

00:54:42.500 --> 00:54:46.060
 - Which is why I've stopped drinking water, actually.

00:54:46.060 --> 00:54:47.660
 Yeah, is there a filter for that?

00:54:47.660 --> 00:54:49.820
 (laughing)

00:54:49.820 --> 00:54:50.820
 Fittler, it's cool.

00:54:50.820 --> 00:54:52.860
 - It hasn't been through,

00:54:52.860 --> 00:54:54.820
 I mean, Hitler didn't drink that much.

00:54:54.820 --> 00:54:55.660
 I don't think every glass of water--

00:54:55.660 --> 00:54:57.180
 - I think he was a T-Total.

00:54:57.180 --> 00:54:59.100
 - Or is it, is that a thing that is enough?

00:54:59.100 --> 00:55:00.460
 - There's enough molecules.

00:55:00.460 --> 00:55:01.300
 - Yeah.

00:55:01.300 --> 00:55:02.420
 - Sorry, sorry, I just remembered.

00:55:02.420 --> 00:55:04.700
 It's not the whole glass of water.

00:55:04.700 --> 00:55:06.140
 It's one molecule.

00:55:06.140 --> 00:55:08.380
 (laughing)

00:55:08.380 --> 00:55:10.960
 (upbeat music)

00:55:11.160 --> 00:55:13.440
 (upbeat music)

00:55:13.440 --> 00:55:15.400
 - Okay, that's it, that is all of our facts.

00:55:15.400 --> 00:55:16.840
