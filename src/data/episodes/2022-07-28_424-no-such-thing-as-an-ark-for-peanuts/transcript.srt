1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:16,100
 - Hello, and welcome to another episode

3
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:17,780
 of No Such Thing as a Fish,

4
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:19,440
 a weekly podcast coming to you

5
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:21,820
 from the QI offices in Covent Garden.

6
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:23,020
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

7
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:25,500
 I am sitting here with Andrew Hunter Murray,

8
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:27,820
 Anna Tyshinski, and James Harkin.

9
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:29,100
 And once again, we have gathered

10
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:31,440
 around the microphones with our four favorite facts

11
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:32,800
 from the last seven days,

12
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:36,120
 and in no particular order, here we go.

13
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:40,220
 Starting with fact number one, and that is Andy.

14
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:41,940
 - My fact this week is that there was a job

15
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:45,600
 in the 19th century, which just involved looking at the sea

16
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,120
 and being able to tell when there were pilchards

17
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:49,240
 under the surface.

18
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:50,080
 (laughing)

19
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:50,920
 - Amazing.

20
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:52,400
 So were they, they weren't sticking their head

21
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:53,400
 under the sea.

22
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:55,800
 - No, don't be crazy, James.

23
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:57,440
 - Okay.

24
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:58,560
 - Little bit of inside baseball.

25
00:00:58,560 --> 00:00:59,980
 - Dan told us before we started recording

26
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:01,380
 that's what he thought the job was.

27
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:03,660
 - Yeah, and I told you before the recording specifically,

28
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:05,620
 so it wouldn't get mentioned on the recording,

29
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:06,820
 and look at us now.

30
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:09,640
 This is an amazing job.

31
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:12,300
 And it's not like they're sitting like a lifeguard

32
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:13,620
 on a boat looking down.

33
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:14,740
 They're up on a hill.

34
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:15,580
 - They are.

35
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:16,420
 - They're not even in the sea.

36
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:17,740
 - So I should say where this comes from.

37
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:20,260
 It comes from this brilliant blog called About 1816,

38
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:22,420
 which is by an author called James Hobson,

39
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:23,940
 who's written loads of books about George and Britain.

40
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:25,100
 There's one about stage coaches,

41
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:26,500
 which I was reading recently.

42
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:28,840
 And he also writes about Cornish-piltered culture

43
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:30,560
 in the 18th century.

44
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:31,980
 - An obvious crossover.

45
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:34,320
 - And well, there were these,

46
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,160
 it was this huge part of Cornwall's economy

47
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:38,680
 in the 18th century was piltered fishing

48
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:41,280
 because they were these fish that came to the coast

49
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,080
 by the million, millions and millions of them.

50
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:47,120
 This job was called being a hewer,

51
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:49,440
 literally like hue and cry, you know, shouting.

52
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:51,160
 And they would stand on the high points along the coast.

53
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:55,120
 And when they saw this moving patch of purpley,

54
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:57,280
 oily color on the surface,

55
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:00,020
 they knew that was the sign that there was the huge,

56
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:00,860
 I was about to say flock,

57
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:02,740
 a shoal of pilchards underneath it.

58
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:04,820
 And maybe there was some sea birds hanging around it as well.

59
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:06,740
 And then they would blow a special trumpet

60
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:09,540
 or they would wave their little flags

61
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:11,740
 and they would shout, go and get the pilchards

62
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:12,580
 to the fishermen.

63
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:13,420
 And then the fishermen would go and.

64
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:15,560
 - No, they would, they would shout, hever.

65
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:16,400
 - Trick.

66
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,240
 - Yeah, hever.

67
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,080
 - What does that mean, hever?

68
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,020
 - It's an old word meaning fish and carnage.

69
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:21,460
 - Ah, fish.

70
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:23,360
 - But now you get hever cake

71
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,700
 if you go to a Cornish bakery.

72
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:26,320
 - But it's not fish cake.

73
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:30,240
 It's just related to the cake that was baked

74
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:32,280
 for these fishermen when they would leave for the day out.

75
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,120
 - Oh, okay, yeah.

76
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,760
 - And the trumpet thing, by the way,

77
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:37,600
 hewing is an old word for trumpeting,

78
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,440
 according to the OED.

79
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:40,280
 - Apparently, yes.

80
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:42,160
 - And it's not, this is not like your regular trumpet.

81
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,940
 This was a four foot trumpet.

82
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:44,780
 - Was it?

83
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:45,620
 - Yes, huge.

84
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:46,460
 - I know this.

85
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:48,680
 - And they had these flags as well.

86
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:50,440
 So they would wave semaphore flags,

87
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:54,000
 which had special meanings to communicate to the boats,

88
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,380
 like go over there or come this way a bit or whatever.

89
00:02:57,380 --> 00:02:59,080
 - 'Cause then they directed the boats, didn't they?

90
00:02:59,080 --> 00:02:59,920
 - Yeah, exactly.

91
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:00,760
 - Which they'd seen them.

92
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:02,200
 'Cause Wilkie Collins, obviously,

93
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,260
 and I'm famous, Victorian author,

94
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:04,580
 but he also wrote a bunch of essays

95
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:06,220
 and one of them was about these hewers.

96
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:09,060
 And he described them as feverishly waving

97
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:10,740
 two cloth-covered bushes,

98
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:14,620
 acting the part of a maniac of the most dangerous character.

99
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:16,660
 'Cause they're just standing on a cliffside.

100
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:18,980
 - Cloth-covered bushes, like before they had flags,

101
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:21,220
 they had to cover a bush in cloth.

102
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:22,300
 It's weird.

103
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:23,500
 They could have just waved around the cloth,

104
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:24,340
 if you would think.

105
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:25,160
 - Yeah.

106
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,000
 What would they, presumably,

107
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,740
 if you had spotted, you've sounded your horn,

108
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:31,360
 you've got your semaphore flag out, bush.

109
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,040
 Presumably, you've sounded the horn

110
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,840
 because you've seen pilchards.

111
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:35,680
 Okay?

112
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:36,520
 You've seen them over that way.

113
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,560
 - Otherwise, you're gonna lose your job as a killer.

114
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,640
 - You're gonna lose your job, exactly.

115
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,920
 It's the main purpose of the job.

116
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:42,400
 You've pointed your flag at the direction.

117
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,960
 What semaphore needs to happen?

118
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,920
 What are you trying to communicate with the semaphore?

119
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:48,960
 - You're telling the boats where they are specifically.

120
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:51,120
 So you're saying go to the right, go to the left,

121
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,600
 go out to sea, come closer.

122
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:53,440
 - Okay.

123
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,920
 - Just drop your nets there, kind of thing.

124
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:55,760
 - Yeah.

125
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,760
 - It was probably less complex semaphore

126
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:00,280
 and more just pointing a flag to the right or to the left.

127
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,520
 - I'm pretty sure it was proper.

128
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,360
 It was proper.

129
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,200
 I've looked up the signals.

130
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,560
 Yeah, yeah, I've looked up the signals.

131
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,520
 So it wasn't just, you know, left for left.

132
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,360
 - So what were they?

133
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,180
 I take it back.

134
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:09,240
 - I mean, this is the worst possible medium

135
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:11,000
 to communicate what the semaphore signals were.

136
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:11,840
 - You can explain.

137
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:12,680
 - You know.

138
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:13,520
 But it's just like you said, James,

139
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:15,540
 there will be go east or go right off,

140
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:16,780
 which means go straight out.

141
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:18,440
 It doesn't mean go right.

142
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:20,160
 And cast net.

143
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,000
 - Oh, yeah.

144
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,680
 - Also, they could get messages to ships.

145
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,880
 So they could signal to a man on board a ship

146
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:27,480
 that his wife had had a baby.

147
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,320
 - Ah.

148
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,160
 - Yeah.

149
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,000
 - In semaphore language.

150
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,220
 - I don't know what the semaphore for that was.

151
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:33,320
 (laughing)

152
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:34,160
 - That's so good.

153
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,760
 - They're seriously oily.

154
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:37,280
 I've never really understood when people talk about

155
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,880
 oily fish and the non-oily fish,

156
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:42,920
 and they're bang on about oily fish being really good for you.

157
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,680
 What really, what the difference was,

158
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:45,760
 but that's why they were prized.

159
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:46,600
 So in the 19th century,

160
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:49,120
 they were prized for their oil for lamps, weren't they?

161
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:49,960
 - Yeah.

162
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:50,800
 - And so that would just be sold

163
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,680
 and that would fund the whole industry.

164
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:53,520
 - Yeah.

165
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,480
 - And you'd have these filtered palaces.

166
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56,320
 - Yes.

167
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,400
 - Where they put all the fish in a barrel,

168
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:01,600
 put 6,000 fish in a huge hog-seed barrel.

169
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,560
 And then I think you squeeze down on the fish

170
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:08,320
 and all the oil comes out and drains off into the gutters.

171
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,240
 And then that's barreled up separately.

172
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,080
 - Yeah, right.

173
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:12,520
 - And you burnt, you can use it for lamps and things like that.

174
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,040
 - Well, they used to just hand them out as well

175
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,200
 to anyone who was quite poor.

176
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,760
 So as the boats would come back in,

177
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:19,340
 there's reports that you would have locals standing

178
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:22,200
 in the water just waiting for it to come in and say,

179
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:24,240
 "Can you please just give me Pilchards?"

180
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,920
 And the person who was on the ship would feel

181
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:29,320
 it was honor-bound to give the Pilchards.

182
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,480
 So they would just hand them out.

183
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,880
 And then at the palaces as well,

184
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:33,320
 there would be the poor waiting outside

185
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:34,480
 and they would be waiting for fish

186
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:37,080
 that had like broken backs or that were diseased

187
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:39,200
 or you know, the ones that were being shot.

188
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:42,200
 - They must have derived from these 30 million Pilchards

189
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,640
 with little x-ray machines.

190
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:45,200
 See if they've broken their spine.

191
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:47,360
 - Well, this one's got a bit of a cuff.

192
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,200
 - That's the paw.

193
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:50,320
 - Cross the line.

194
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,140
 - But the only thing kids used to go to the beaches

195
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:55,140
 with plastic bags and kind of scoop them out of the water.

196
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:56,820
 But it's not just today.

197
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:58,500
 - Plastic bags?

198
00:05:58,500 --> 00:05:59,500
 - But not plastic.

199
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:00,340
 (laughing)

200
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:03,860
 - Quite century and now, Cornwall is, you know,

201
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:05,140
 quite behind the times in some aspects,

202
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:06,740
 but in others, unbelievably advanced.

203
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:09,620
 - It had the Tesco plastic bags early in the 1400s.

204
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:10,980
 - They had the oil to make it from, didn't they?

205
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:11,940
 'Cause it was a bloody Pilchard.

206
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:12,940
 - Yes, exactly.

207
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:16,820
 Sorry, not plastic bags, other bags, non-plastic bags.

208
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:19,320
 - But yeah, so it was back in the 1800s, it was massive.

209
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:22,360
 And in 1871, they were exporting

210
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:25,600
 roughly 16,000 tons per year.

211
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:29,160
 Now, that declined massively in Cornwall,

212
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:31,600
 massively, massively, to the point of the 90s

213
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:35,760
 where they were only landing about six tons in total.

214
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:38,720
 So from 16,000 to six tons, and that's the early 90s.

215
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:41,280
 But then that all changed when a man called Nutty Nowhere

216
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:45,280
 came along and he reinvigorated the whole thing

217
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,740
 by rebranding the Pilchard.

218
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:48,860
 - I've seen Nutty Nowhere.

219
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:51,180
 I think he's making some strong claims.

220
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:52,740
 - Huge claims.

221
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:54,460
 - Well, he's basically just a random fisherman.

222
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:56,340
 Is he from the South Coast?

223
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:57,860
 - Yes, what's he climbing?

224
00:06:57,860 --> 00:06:59,300
 - He's from Cadwyth?

225
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:00,140
 - Oh, he's from Cadwyth.

226
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:01,740
 Okay, yeah, I go to Cadwyth every year.

227
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:03,540
 I probably met him down the pub.

228
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:05,460
 And I don't know if he's a guy

229
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:06,540
 who's reformed the whole industry.

230
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:08,100
 I mean, it's not like everyone's eating Pilchards

231
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:08,940
 for every meal, right?

232
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:10,740
 - No, but I mean, a lot of people,

233
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:13,700
 when you read interviews, sort of claim that he called them

234
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:15,960
 Cornish Sardines, that suddenly was like,

235
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:17,360
 "Ooh, that sounds a bit posh."

236
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,800
 - Well, someone called them that.

237
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:19,840
 They have had a rebrand.

238
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:20,680
 - Yeah, exactly.

239
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:21,800
 It wasn't him, but it was in that.

240
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,080
 Well, actually, no, it was him.

241
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:23,920
 - It wasn't him.

242
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:26,720
 It was a guy called Nick Howell, I believe, in the '90s,

243
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:29,920
 who, yeah, realized that Pilchards had a bad reputation.

244
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,880
 They're called Sardines on the continent.

245
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:33,080
 And so, yeah, they were called.

246
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:35,440
 And Pilchards are just adult Sardines,

247
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,680
 what we call Sardines, Pilchards are like adult versions

248
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,240
 of that, aren't they? - And they're all herring.

249
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,600
 - And they're all types of herring.

250
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,600
 - What was his connection then to Nutty Nowhere?

251
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,440
 - 'Cause Nutty Nowhere was--

252
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,280
 - I don't know who Nutty Nowhere is.

253
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:45,860
 - Oh, Nutty Nowhere's a guy called Martin Ellis,

254
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:47,260
 and he was basically the only--

255
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:48,820
 (laughing)

256
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:50,540
 - Why do you keep calling him Nutty Nowhere?

257
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:51,460
 - Well, that's what he calls himself.

258
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:52,820
 It's his nickname.

259
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:54,380
 And he kind of--

260
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:56,800
 - Yeah, he collected two of every nuts, didn't he?

261
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,100
 (laughing)

262
00:07:58,100 --> 00:07:59,780
 Saved them when there was a big flood.

263
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:00,740
 - Exactly.

264
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:02,260
 - Two peanuts.

265
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:04,700
 - Well, ironically, apparently, his ship sank,

266
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:06,700
 so I don't think, that's the story.

267
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:07,540
 Did you read this?

268
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:08,380
 - No.

269
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:10,580
 - He took in too much Pilchard.

270
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:12,760
 It's got too heavy, and his ship went down,

271
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:14,520
 and it had to be rescued,

272
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:16,080
 and the helicopter had to come in to do it.

273
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,860
 - The helicopter's rescuing a whole ship.

274
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:18,800
 (laughing)

275
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,840
 - I think him and the Pilchards, possibly.

276
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:21,680
 - Oh, sir.

277
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,280
 (laughing)

278
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,120
 - Take the Pilchards first.

279
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,520
 - But this one's gonna broken back.

280
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:27,860
 I don't care.

281
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:29,360
 - Women in Pilchards first.

282
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:32,400
 (laughing)

283
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:36,280
 - Yeah, but the point is, I can't find any record

284
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:39,680
 of a helicopter picking up a Pilchard man called Nutty Nowhere.

285
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:41,660
 So it's the story that's told to him.

286
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:43,460
 - I think they do a lot of rescues out in Cornwall.

287
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:44,300
 - But they log them as well.

288
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:46,160
 There's a log rescues.

289
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,980
 - You do have to log the rescues.

290
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:50,300
 It's frowned on to just go around rescuing people

291
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:51,140
 and they're not telling anyone.

292
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:52,540
 - Did you check Nutty Nowhere and his actual name,

293
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:53,380
 Martin, whenever it is?

294
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:54,620
 - Good point, I just did Nutty Nowhere.

295
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:56,620
 I should go back and check Martin Ellis.

296
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:58,180
 - They wouldn't put it on the form, would they?

297
00:08:58,180 --> 00:09:00,220
 Like, person rescues.

298
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:01,260
 - It was a massive list.

299
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:03,940
 There was six tons of Pilchard that I had to get through

300
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:04,780
 before his name came.

301
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:05,620
 (laughing)

302
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:06,940
 Every individual one.

303
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:07,780
 - Every Pilchard.

304
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:09,960
 - I mean, actually, Billy, Sarah.

305
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,880
 (laughing)

306
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:14,120
 They are elsewhere.

307
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:16,680
 It's not just Cornwall that has a monopoly on them.

308
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:19,760
 And I actually, when I was looking at my Pilchard can

309
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,120
 and realized it came from South Africa,

310
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,400
 I thought, "I wonder how many there are?"

311
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:24,280
 And there are shed loads in South Africa

312
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:26,600
 and they've turned it into a big tourist industry there.

313
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:29,200
 And the Sardine Harvest, the Pilchard Harvest,

314
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:32,440
 is so massive that sometimes they don't need nets

315
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:36,040
 'cause the sea just dumps piles on the beach.

316
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:38,120
 - Oh, wow.

317
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:38,960
 - The sea retreats.

318
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:41,180
 - Also, just like a tractor or a dump truck.

319
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:43,160
 - Exactly, scoop it up.

320
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:46,240
 And yeah, they've got sort of festival days

321
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,440
 where they invite tourists to come and take part

322
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:50,980
 in various Sardine marches and stuff like that.

323
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:52,340
 No one knows why they go there.

324
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:54,620
 But it's kind of a mystery because the shores

325
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:56,820
 of like Northern South Africa where they hang out

326
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:58,960
 are not very appealing to Sardines.

327
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:01,380
 - And do we know why they come to Cornwall?

328
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:04,360
 Are they mating, or are they feeding?

329
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,580
 - Oh, we don't know.

330
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:07,240
 I think it's for feeding.

331
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,520
 I think they're coming.

332
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:09,920
 Which way would they be coming?

333
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,120
 I think it's for feeding.

334
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:13,480
 - But that African Sardine run that you mentioned, Anna,

335
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:16,960
 that might be the biggest biological movement on the planet

336
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:19,840
 'cause there's also the East African wildebeest herds.

337
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:21,200
 Obviously, your individual wildebeest,

338
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,840
 lot bigger than your individual Pilchard.

339
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:26,040
 But there are so many Pilchards

340
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:28,200
 that they might outweigh all the wildebeest.

341
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,280
 It's hard to tell.

342
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:30,120
 - It's one of those classic,

343
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:32,120
 would you rather fight one wildebeest

344
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:34,120
 or a thousand Pilchards?

345
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:36,140
 - It depends where you're fighting them.

346
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:37,740
 If you're in the sea,

347
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:38,900
 I'll take on the wildebeest.

348
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:40,380
 (laughing)

349
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:41,380
 - 'Cause they've challenged you.

350
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:44,100
 You are the one who gets to choose the location.

351
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:46,100
 I would choose actually a hot air balloon for either.

352
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:47,100
 For either fight.

353
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:47,940
 - That's clever.

354
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:49,020
 - Playing it really safe.

355
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:50,540
 Don't even back yourself against the Pilchards

356
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:51,380
 on the desert.

357
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:53,020
 (laughing)

358
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:54,100
 - Why take the risk?

359
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:56,820
 - They have a tendency of disappearing and reappearing.

360
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:58,580
 So I think people keep blaming the decline

361
00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:01,500
 of Pilchard industry on like people's declining tastes.

362
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,900
 But they just bugger off sometimes.

363
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:05,400
 This is the thing with oily fish,

364
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,920
 is why you can't depend on them.

365
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:08,520
 'Cause they slip through your fingers.

366
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:10,400
 'Cause the reason they're,

367
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:11,440
 it's not 'cause of that.

368
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,520
 The reason they're oily is 'cause they have to have loads

369
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:15,120
 of fat in their body because they're the fish

370
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:18,600
 that migrate huge distances in massive shoals.

371
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,280
 So that's why you've got these oily fish.

372
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,440
 They're fish that pelagic,

373
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,280
 that live in the middle part of the sea,

374
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:24,480
 as opposed to all your white fish,

375
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,320
 which live at the bottom.

376
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,160
 - Good word.

377
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,880
 - Which I think very much.

378
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:29,200
 I didn't make it up myself.

379
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,240
 (laughing)

380
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,280
 But thank you.

381
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:33,160
 So these shoals sometimes migrate somewhere different.

382
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:36,500
 So in 1820, we say the industry was massive.

383
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:39,420
 In 1820, they all disappeared and went to Ireland.

384
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:41,260
 And the Cornish were really furious.

385
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:44,140
 And there were articles written in the 1820s saying,

386
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:45,580
 you know, this is a complete disaster.

387
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:47,100
 The Irish don't like Pilchards.

388
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:49,420
 They're just flocking to Ireland and the Irish are saying,

389
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:50,340
 we think these are disgusting.

390
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:52,460
 - The Irish do have their own hewers though,

391
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:54,620
 and they have their special laws for their hewers.

392
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:57,780
 - So I think it's got Pilchard fanciings gone up and down.

393
00:11:57,780 --> 00:12:00,620
 So they have sometimes had a big hewering tradition.

394
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:02,620
 And then it just went out of fashion.

395
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:03,460
 - Okay.

396
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:05,960
 There's a special law in Ireland that if you're a hewer,

397
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:08,280
 you're allowed to stand on any private property

398
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:09,120
 to do your job.

399
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:09,960
 - No way.

400
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:10,800
 - What?

401
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,820
 - I mean, you can't go into the middle of Dublin.

402
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:15,420
 Like just stand in someone's house.

403
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:17,360
 - I need to come into your bedroom now.

404
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,640
 (laughing)

405
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:21,680
 - Presumably it's someone's property that's on the coast.

406
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:25,840
 - I got reason to believe there are five million Pilchards

407
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:26,840
 in this room.

408
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:27,680
 Let me in.

409
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:30,240
 Let me into this bank vault right now.

410
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,540
 Help me with my trumpet.

411
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:37,160
 Can I just ask on the hewers that you said it was a job,

412
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:40,700
 but they, I mean, the Pilchards just turn up

413
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:42,700
 at one stage in the autumn, right?

414
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:43,740
 So what do they do for the,

415
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:45,260
 it's very seasonal this job, isn't it?

416
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:46,260
 - It is seasonal work.

417
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:48,060
 You're absolutely right.

418
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:51,300
 I don't, I imagine they had a kind of portfolio career.

419
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:53,220
 - They might be a trumpeter for the rest of the year.

420
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:54,060
 - Yeah, absolutely.

421
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:56,060
 Or a Bush, Semaphore instructor.

422
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:57,380
 I mean, there's all sorts of stuff they could do

423
00:12:57,380 --> 00:12:58,220
 with their skills, you know.

424
00:12:58,220 --> 00:13:01,140
 But they had, yeah, they did get paid a guinea week

425
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:02,140
 during the good times.

426
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:04,140
 So maybe it was one of those jobs where,

427
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:05,780
 much like a tourist season today actually,

428
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:07,220
 you know, it's very big in the high seas.

429
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:09,660
 And then you just sort of, you know.

430
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:11,020
 - Could be a signalman.

431
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:12,060
 - Yes. - A woman.

432
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:13,020
 - Yeah, on the railways.

433
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:13,860
 On the railways, for example.

434
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:15,660
 - On the railways. - At the airports.

435
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:16,780
 - At the airports, yep.

436
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:18,620
 - Could be a plastic bag maker.

437
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:19,960
 - Yeah.

438
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:22,540
 (upbeat music)

439
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:27,580
 - Okay, it is time for fact number two.

440
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:28,820
 And that is my fact.

441
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:31,260
 My fact this week is that the sound designer

442
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:35,060
 for the movie King Richard is called Richard King.

443
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:35,900
 - So good.

444
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:36,740
 - Yeah, so good.

445
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:37,580
 - So great.

446
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:38,820
 Did you just, did you just spot this?

447
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:41,300
 - No, this was a buddy of mine, Ali Plum.

448
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:44,940
 He's the BBC Radio One music reviewer and interviewer.

449
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:46,940
 He spotted it and he told me about it.

450
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:49,460
 And yeah, Richard King is, you know,

451
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:52,540
 he's actually quite famous as you can imagine.

452
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:54,100
 He's part of this big movie.

453
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:55,180
 - He's won for Oscars.

454
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:56,500
 - He's won for Oscars.

455
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:58,300
 And he's, you know, he's been the sound designer for movies

456
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:00,740
 like The Latest Wonder Woman 1984,

457
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:01,820
 Tenet Dunkirk.

458
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:03,740
 So he's very tied in with Christopher Nolan.

459
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:05,060
 He did Interstellar with him.

460
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:07,540
 - Do we know if Richard King only took the job

461
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:11,060
 because he enjoyed the symmetry of the name?

462
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:13,860
 - Oh, I've got a good reason why he might.

463
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:15,420
 Tenet is all about things being backwards

464
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:16,260
 as well as forwards.

465
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:17,100
 - Palindromic.

466
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:18,500
 - King Richard, Richard King.

467
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:20,900
 That's, it explains why he took the job

468
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:22,940
 as well as him being a massively respected sound engineer

469
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:24,980
 and him needing the work.

470
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:27,740
 But for Tenet, this is one specific thing.

471
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:29,180
 So I haven't seen Tenet.

472
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:32,900
 It sounds, so some things happen backwards

473
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:34,220
 even though the world is happening forwards.

474
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:36,380
 - Yeah, you kind of got two parallel things

475
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:38,180
 that happen in one goes forward and one goes backwards.

476
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:39,660
 - Why haven't I watched it?

477
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:41,340
 But they had to make reverse gunshots.

478
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:44,460
 So they tried playing all the sound effects they had.

479
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:46,500
 You know, they have a sound effect of a gun,

480
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:48,960
 which is a bang.

481
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:49,800
 And then.

482
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,900
 - Why didn't they just use you for that?

483
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:53,180
 (laughing)

484
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:54,860
 - But it's, but it sounded rubbish.

485
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:55,940
 It sounded cheap and stupid

486
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:57,020
 when they just played the sounds backwards.

487
00:14:57,020 --> 00:15:00,460
 So they had to generate new sounds of what, you know,

488
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:02,380
 playing, taking off might sound like backwards,

489
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:03,220
 but forwards. - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

490
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:04,420
 Interesting. - It's so weird.

491
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:06,500
 - 'Cause they could have just taken the original one

492
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:08,500
 and made it go backwards, right?

493
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:09,980
 'Cause they have that technology,

494
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:11,660
 but it doesn't quite sound right.

495
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:14,580
 - They have the technology to make sound rewind.

496
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:15,940
 You're kidding. - It's amazing.

497
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:17,300
 - I haven't been able to share this with the rest of us.

498
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:18,820
 - 20 years ago, they had that.

499
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:21,100
 But the thing is that King Richard is about tennis

500
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:22,660
 and that movie is Tenet.

501
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:25,860
 So maybe he's just looking his way through the fix.

502
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:27,180
 - He's definitely got a word thing.

503
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:29,620
 He's the Susie Dent of the sound engineer world.

504
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:30,460
 - Sounds like.

505
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:31,300
 - I don't know.

506
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:32,140
 I wonder if this movie does

507
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:35,300
 because they had a carpenter called James Crane.

508
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:36,700
 Carpenter's might use cranes,

509
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:37,540
 might, and they--

510
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:38,380
 - Why?

511
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:39,500
 I thought it was a carpeting emergency frame

512
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:40,820
 for me to look like, oh yeah.

513
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:42,340
 - Okay, look, this is--

514
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:44,340
 - The viewer was stuck somewhere in Ireland.

515
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:46,140
 - This is the one I'm opening with.

516
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:46,980
 (laughing)

517
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:50,540
 They had an ellen safety manager called Guinevere Aid,

518
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:51,380
 like first aid.

519
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:52,220
 - Yeah, that's good.

520
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:53,060
 - I think that's good, yeah.

521
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:58,060
 The tennis racket stringer was called Jeffrey Ibatuon.

522
00:15:58,060 --> 00:15:59,140
 - That's not true.

523
00:15:59,140 --> 00:15:59,980
 - Ibatuon.

524
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:00,800
 - Ibatuon.

525
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:01,640
 - How are you spelling it?

526
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:02,980
 How much of your words for pronunciation?

527
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:04,940
 - No, no, I-B-A-T-U-A-N.

528
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:05,780
 Ibatuon.

529
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:06,620
 - Oh, wow.

530
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:08,540
 - Okay, that's extremely good.

531
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:10,500
 I would definitely have opened with Ibatuon

532
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:12,860
 rather than James Crane, the carpenter.

533
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:13,700
 (laughing)

534
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:15,580
 If he'd been called James Plane,

535
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:17,340
 I'd have been absolutely on board.

536
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:19,660
 - I'll be honest, like I was working on

537
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:22,140
 just basically all the people who worked on this show

538
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:24,620
 on IMDB and it was Slim Pickings.

539
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:25,460
 (laughing)

540
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:26,460
 - It was Slim Pickings on it.

541
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:27,740
 (laughing)

542
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:28,580
 I love him.

543
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:32,900
 So sound design has a nickname,

544
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:35,260
 which is used within the industry, which is called Foley.

545
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:36,660
 So you're a Foley artist.

546
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:38,780
 Foley sounds within movies.

547
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:40,060
 It's really amazing.

548
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:42,260
 And particularly if you read interviews with Richard King,

549
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:45,260
 he can make something that is quite a boring sound.

550
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:46,500
 Some of these seem like, wow,

551
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:48,900
 what a day that must have been of picking the sound

552
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:51,660
 for this tiny thing that I would never think about.

553
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:55,100
 If you're in a room and a door needs to be opened, right?

554
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:57,260
 You would think, okay, there's probably just this bank

555
00:16:57,260 --> 00:16:59,140
 of sound where it's just door opens.

556
00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:02,500
 And he talks about it saying, no, the variety is endless.

557
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:05,780
 You have doors that are opened because maybe they're open

558
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:07,180
 because there's a baby sleeping in the room.

559
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:08,220
 So it's a soft opening.

560
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:10,540
 So he's like, you don't only have just the creaks

561
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:13,240
 of a door speed opening, you have emotional content

562
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,700
 to the opening of the door.

563
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,140
 And he's like, so I have like, you know,

564
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:18,060
 he's got thousands of doors that he's collected.

565
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:20,500
 - The door, the happy door, the furious door.

566
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:24,340
 - Drunk door, Terminator 2 I was reading about.

567
00:17:24,340 --> 00:17:26,320
 The opening scene of Terminator 2,

568
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:29,800
 there's a sort of exoskeleton terminator walking

569
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:33,140
 in a apocalypse over all these skulls and stuff.

570
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:35,100
 So the ambient sound that you hear in that scene,

571
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:36,660
 if you watch that scene next time,

572
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:39,100
 is you've got someone having put a microphone

573
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:40,980
 just next to the crack in the door

574
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:44,020
 at George Lucas' Skywalker Ranch

575
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:46,860
 and just getting the ambience of the outside.

576
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:49,460
 And that's mixed with someone going, whoosh,

577
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:51,460
 with their mouth, whoosh.

578
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:52,980
 So that's what you're hearing in the background.

579
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:55,820
 And then when this exoskeleton is standing

580
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:57,660
 on all of these human skulls,

581
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:59,580
 that's pistachio nuts being crushed.

582
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:01,660
 So those are the elements that you see in that scene.

583
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:04,580
 And just how they get to thinking a pistachio nut

584
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:07,620
 can be a better sound than a real skull being crushed.

585
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:08,940
 (laughing)

586
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:11,060
 - Sometimes easy to access pistachio nut shells,

587
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:13,380
 down natural skulls, isn't it, in different places?

588
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:15,460
 - If you get a pistachio nut, you know how they're like

589
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:17,460
 slightly open on one end,

590
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:20,060
 if you just squeeze the slightly open end,

591
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:23,140
 then the lever mechanism will open the other end

592
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:25,980
 and you can just pull the top shell off

593
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:28,620
 and then just get to the inside without kind of pressure.

594
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:29,980
 - Are you sure that actually works?

595
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:30,820
 - Yeah, I do. - Does it?

596
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:31,660
 - Yeah. - Really?

597
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:32,740
 - You would have been fired by Richard King

598
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:35,860
 immediately when you handed in your sound effects.

599
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:37,780
 - What the fuck is this, James?

600
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:39,140
 - What I'm just thinking is,

601
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:41,860
 when you watch actual tennis, right,

602
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:44,220
 someone does a serve and you hear the noise

603
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:46,460
 of the serve and it's quite,

604
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:49,740
 you know, you would know that noise if you heard it, right?

605
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:53,420
 But I remember reading that sometimes in sports, on TV,

606
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:55,860
 they add the sounds in later, right?

607
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:56,900
 I don't know if this is true,

608
00:18:56,900 --> 00:19:01,020
 but I remember reading that when a dart hits a dartboard,

609
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:03,260
 if you imagine yourself playing darts,

610
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:05,780
 they don't make that "foof" when it hits it, right?

611
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:06,980
 But then some people do that.

612
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:10,500
 And I remember reading that in horse racing,

613
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:12,660
 there's no microphones on the far side,

614
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:14,780
 so there's no way you could make that sound.

615
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:16,900
 So I thought that they use "Wilder Beast."

616
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:18,340
 - They do. - That's crazy.

617
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:19,620
 - They absolutely, they play that in.

618
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:22,420
 - It's the sound of a stampeding "Wilder Beast."

619
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:24,500
 And they play it, they don't play it for the audience

620
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:26,180
 in the, you know. - No, obviously live.

621
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:27,540
 - On TV. - They play it over TV, yeah.

622
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:28,780
 So this is insane.

623
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:31,900
 I was reading about a guy called Dennis Baxter,

624
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:34,940
 who was the sound designer for the Olympics in 2012.

625
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:36,500
 And in fact, multiple Olympic games.

626
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:38,020
 And this is exactly the problem, James,

627
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:40,060
 because loads of places,

628
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:42,060
 they don't have microphones for the whole thing.

629
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:44,060
 But they have to add microphones wherever they can,

630
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:45,700
 and then sometimes cheat a bit.

631
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:47,380
 So for the balance beams,

632
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:49,540
 they would put microphones on the beam.

633
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:52,340
 So no audience would ever hear the creaking

634
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:53,380
 and the movement of the beam. - Yeah, yeah.

635
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:54,500
 - But you do on TV.

636
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:55,500
 And then for the archery,

637
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:57,580
 they had a microphone on the target.

638
00:19:57,580 --> 00:19:59,780
 They had a microphone next to the archer for the launch.

639
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:02,380
 And they also put one in between

640
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:04,660
 on the arrow's path to capture the swoosh.

641
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:07,100
 - Oh, so that's why they're catching the actual sound there.

642
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:08,180
 They're not, 'cause for me,

643
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:10,500
 I would probably get like a ruler

644
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:13,180
 on the side of a table and then twang it.

645
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:15,420
 (all laughing)

646
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:16,620
 - That's genius. - Yeah.

647
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:18,580
 But you're right, they fake it sometimes.

648
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:21,220
 So Dennis Baxter, he did the boat race for a while.

649
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:22,940
 - Oh, was this in an interview with him?

650
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:24,860
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, I've heard this, amazing.

651
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:27,020
 - The boat race, if you're actually in the boats

652
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:28,420
 or on the bank, what it sounds like

653
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:30,180
 is the engines of the support boats

654
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:31,900
 and the helicopters flying overhead.

655
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:33,100
 And if you play that on TV,

656
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:35,500
 it would be an incredibly weird experience.

657
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:36,900
 So he went out before the boat race.

658
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:39,940
 He recorded clean swishing rowing sounds.

659
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:41,140
 And that's what you're hearing.

660
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:42,700
 You're hearing Dennis Baxter rowing

661
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:44,340
 or someone being recorded live. - Well, he cheated.

662
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:45,500
 That's amazing. - Yeah, yeah.

663
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:46,340
 - How cool is that?

664
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:47,460
 - And it is the tennis as well.

665
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:49,860
 It's a really precise job working out

666
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:53,180
 when to up the volume of the ball hitting sound

667
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:54,180
 and when to decrease it.

668
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:55,940
 And it depends completely on the tension

669
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:57,540
 and also the crowd sound.

670
00:20:57,540 --> 00:20:59,780
 And I think he does ground sounds as well.

671
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:02,140
 And yeah, he talks about you have to sense

672
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:05,020
 how tense a moment it is and then reduce the crowd sound

673
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:07,780
 or sense that everyone's getting really excited

674
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:09,220
 and then you bring up the crowd sound

675
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:11,300
 and then you make the sound of the tennis ball

676
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:13,580
 hitting the ground a bit less, the crowd a bit higher.

677
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:15,380
 - Is there someone doing the moaning as well?

678
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:16,700
 (laughing)

679
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:17,820
 - That's his wife actually.

680
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:20,080
 (laughing)

681
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:24,220
 - I was reading about Foley

682
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:27,580
 and there was actually a film made about Foley art itself

683
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:30,340
 and it's called Burberry and Sound Studio.

684
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:32,260
 It was a horror film that was made in about 2012.

685
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:34,020
 It had some famous actors in it.

686
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:35,020
 It was meant to be okay.

687
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:37,100
 Anyway, it was partly about Foley art.

688
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:40,260
 So the main character is working in a movie studio

689
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:41,700
 and he's coming up with sound effects.

690
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:44,260
 And in this film, he has to come up with the sound effects

691
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:46,380
 for these really gory horror scenes.

692
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:47,980
 And he has to come up with these sound effects

693
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:51,260
 by smashing up pieces of fruit, the classic.

694
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:52,700
 So he's shown in this film,

695
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:55,660
 smashing up watermelons or mangoes or whatever it takes.

696
00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:57,900
 But they realized when making this film

697
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:59,980
 that the sound of fruit smashing up,

698
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:02,320
 it does not actually sound enough

699
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:04,100
 like the sound of fruit smashing up.

700
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:05,860
 - So they had to find some skulls

701
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:08,400
 and break them in, didn't they?

702
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,460
 - They couldn't get the skulls,

703
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:12,780
 but the sound of the fruit smashing up is made

704
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:16,940
 with pieces of wet cloth and bits of wood being bashed around.

705
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:17,780
 - That's amazing.

706
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:18,620
 - That's so funny.

707
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:20,260
 - How better is that?

708
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:24,060
 - We keep saying Jack Foley was a real person as well.

709
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:25,900
 This was the person who created the idea

710
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:28,900
 that you could overdub within the sort of

711
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:31,300
 behind the scenes of the movie, the post-production.

712
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:34,260
 And his first job when he did it was he was working

713
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:37,460
 on a movie which was showboat.

714
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:40,900
 And his first, I think one of his first things

715
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:43,700
 that he did for it was he walked as three people.

716
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:46,300
 So he had a cane and he had his own footsteps

717
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:48,140
 and he managed to match the footsteps

718
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:51,700
 of three people walking using both just his feet and a cane.

719
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:53,940
 And that was the moment when they went, oh my God,

720
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:55,020
 this is, what is this?

721
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:56,980
 And he started experimenting more of it.

722
00:22:56,980 --> 00:22:58,620
 - Was it three one-legged people?

723
00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:01,140
 - No, I guess you can move your feet quite fast

724
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:04,060
 to be in time with all of the feet, can't you?

725
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:06,140
 - So did he get people to close their eyes

726
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:09,660
 and say three people are gonna come in and out of this room

727
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:14,660
 and then did the three gates and then said it was all me?

728
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:16,180
 - Oh, I see.

729
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:17,700
 No, I think he just showed them the product

730
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:19,300
 of the recording, matched with the film.

731
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:23,180
 - He could have been an incredible master criminal, you know.

732
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:25,660
 - Make it look like a burglary was five people,

733
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:26,500
 but actually it was one.

734
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:29,340
 - Make it sound like a burglary was five people, you know?

735
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:30,180
 - That's true.

736
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:32,060
 - He's no good with an eyewitness.

737
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:34,740
 - No, he could only operate under conditions

738
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:37,260
 of pitch black darkness.

739
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:40,660
 But they would, you know, afterwards the security guard

740
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:41,500
 who'd been blindfolded.

741
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:42,940
 - He could rob spec savers.

742
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:44,140
 - Exactly.

743
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:46,100
 Again, everyone would have to be blindfolded

744
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:47,260
 and in the area as well.

745
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:49,300
 But then they would say afterwards, oh yeah,

746
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:52,180
 15 large-

747
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:53,020
 - Will the Beast.

748
00:23:53,020 --> 00:23:54,500
 - Will the Beast came in to the shop

749
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:55,580
 and took all the glasses.

750
00:23:55,580 --> 00:23:58,100
 - Or herring, we're not sure which.

751
00:23:58,100 --> 00:23:59,460
 - But he could do them so accurately

752
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:01,860
 and then 'cause they'd never look for Jack Foley.

753
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:05,140
 - So he died when he was 76 years old

754
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:07,300
 and he reckoned he had a long career in movies.

755
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:08,620
 - Well, or did he?

756
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:10,300
 Did he just make it sound like he died

757
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:12,140
 to continue his crime spree?

758
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:13,100
 - Good call, yeah.

759
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:15,820
 That's a cold case, we don't know.

760
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:18,500
 But he reckoned he did 5,000 miles of walking

761
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:21,500
 in the time of his career for films.

762
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:23,060
 He doesn't say whether or not that was like,

763
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:25,620
 I was walking to buy some pistachios

764
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:27,500
 or I assume it's the footsteps

765
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:28,940
 that have appeared on our screens.

766
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:31,580
 - Yeah, I would assume so, I don't know.

767
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:34,820
 - But also his voice was on movies.

768
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:37,940
 He is responsible for the first ever, we believe,

769
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:41,220
 Tarzan Cole, the very first, yeah,

770
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:43,740
 Tarzan the Tiger in 1929 was the first movie

771
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:44,940
 and it wasn't that though.

772
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:45,780
 - Was it not?

773
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:48,380
 - No, it was just him going, ee-ah!

774
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:51,340
 And that was supposedly Jack Foley.

775
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:53,260
 It's sort of a bit lost whether or not it was him

776
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:55,260
 because I think the footage itself has been lost.

777
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:56,460
 It's one of those lost films.

778
00:24:56,460 --> 00:24:59,820
 Cole, the one that we know that goes, ee-ah!

779
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:01,500
 It's like a palindrome, isn't it?

780
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,220
 That's the fun facts about that.

781
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:04,300
 - And it's trademarked.

782
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:07,140
 It's owned by the Edgar Rice Burrows family

783
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:10,020
 and they've got the exact, it's like nine calls

784
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:11,220
 or 10 calls, isn't it?

785
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:12,260
 And it's an exhale in it.

786
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:13,700
 - Well, after Tenet and Tennis,

787
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:16,620
 Richard King can do Tarzan next, yeah.

788
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:18,620
 - The film just about the Tarzan Cole.

789
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:20,780
 How would you, what would the title of that film be?

790
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:22,460
 - If it was just about the Cole.

791
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:25,460
 (all laughing)

792
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:27,460
 - I was just wondering how you'd spell the film name.

793
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:29,340
 (all laughing)

794
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:30,180
 Just goes away.

795
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:33,860
 - R-E-R-E-R-E-R, I think.

796
00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:35,220
 (all laughing)

797
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:36,820
 - You'd think it was a hospital drama.

798
00:25:36,820 --> 00:25:37,980
 - Right, right, right, right.

799
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:41,140
 (all laughing)

800
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:43,980
 - Should we talk about the William sisters?

801
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:44,820
 - Yeah.

802
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:47,380
 - So this movie, King Richard,

803
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:49,860
 the King Richard in the title is the father

804
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:51,580
 of Venus and Serena Williams.

805
00:25:51,580 --> 00:25:54,540
 And he, I don't think it gives anything away

806
00:25:54,540 --> 00:25:57,900
 for the movie to say he was a very hot housing father

807
00:25:57,900 --> 00:26:02,020
 who really wanted his children to be tennis players

808
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:03,500
 at a very, very young age.

809
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:05,100
 He'd never had any training,

810
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:08,260
 but he taught them how to become great tennis players

811
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:10,580
 and they were the greatest of all time.

812
00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:13,980
 I read an interview with Venus from 1991.

813
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:15,820
 This was in Sports Illustrated.

814
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:18,380
 And even then she knew she wanted to be a tennis player.

815
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:19,700
 She was a brilliant tennis player.

816
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:21,340
 They said, "What would you like to be when you grow up?"

817
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:23,420
 She's like, "I want to be a tennis player."

818
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:27,620
 Or an archeologist or an astronaut who travels to Jupiter.

819
00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:28,460
 - Cool.

820
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:29,300
 - Wow.

821
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:32,220
 - That was her three possible things she wanted to be.

822
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:33,900
 And I looked it up 'cause I wondered,

823
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:36,900
 and this is true, both Venus and Serena

824
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:40,580
 have now owned properties in the town of Jupiter, Florida.

825
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:41,420
 - No.

826
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:42,260
 - So they kind of went,

827
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:43,860
 'cause a lot of sports people live in Jupiter,

828
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:45,140
 so, and they, yeah.

829
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:45,980
 - Very nice.

830
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:46,820
 - That's great.

831
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:47,740
 - Isn't that the Jupiter she meant

832
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:49,220
 when she was five years old, is it?

833
00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:50,780
 (all laughing)

834
00:26:50,780 --> 00:26:51,900
 Just happens to be an astronaut,

835
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:52,740
 but living in a tennis place.

836
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:53,580
 - That's amazing.

837
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:56,500
 - Venus Williams, one of the two Williams sisters.

838
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:57,340
 - That's right.

839
00:26:57,340 --> 00:26:59,100
 - Owns a quarter of a dolphin.

840
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:00,620
 (all laughing)

841
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:01,620
 - A Miami dolphin?

842
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:03,700
 - A Miami dolphin, the American football team.

843
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:06,180
 She has a stake in the Miami dolphins,

844
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:07,180
 and it's quite a small stake.

845
00:27:07,180 --> 00:27:08,740
 - With Serena?

846
00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:11,900
 - Yeah, but I think, so it's about,

847
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:14,700
 it's less than 1% that they own or that she owns.

848
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:17,180
 But anyway, if you include all the spare players

849
00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:18,540
 they would have, it would work out

850
00:27:18,540 --> 00:27:20,500
 at one quarter of one dolphin.

851
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:21,340
 - Amazing.

852
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:22,180
 - Wow.

853
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:23,020
 (all laughing)

854
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:25,020
 - Wait, and it's both of them that own it then, is it?

855
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:26,780
 - It's quite hard to find the exact chapter of verse

856
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:28,940
 on how much they own or whether they own it together.

857
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:29,980
 - You can understand why that hasn't been

858
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:31,860
 too extensively reported on, I guess,

859
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:34,100
 with all the stuff out there about the Williams sisters.

860
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:35,940
 (all laughing)

861
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:38,860
 In 1995, Serena was 14,

862
00:27:38,860 --> 00:27:41,820
 and she wanted to go pro,

863
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:43,580
 and she was too young by the rules.

864
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:45,580
 And so she filed a lawsuit,

865
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:49,300
 an antitrust lawsuit against the WTA, I think.

866
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:50,140
 - Really?

867
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:51,140
 - Saying I should be able to play.

868
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:54,060
 And actually, their dad had a bit of a vault vass

869
00:27:54,060 --> 00:27:56,660
 in their early teens because he suddenly realized

870
00:27:56,660 --> 00:27:58,220
 that tennis can really screw you up.

871
00:27:58,220 --> 00:28:00,540
 And the junior tennis circuit,

872
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:02,460
 all the parents were just awful.

873
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:04,180
 There was a little bit of racism around.

874
00:28:04,180 --> 00:28:06,100
 And he actually said to, I think Venus,

875
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:07,540
 I don't think you should become a tennis player.

876
00:28:07,540 --> 00:28:08,940
 But she must have thought, well, thanks a lot, dad.

877
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:09,780
 (all laughing)

878
00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:11,540
 I don't think even nothing else for 12 years.

879
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:13,220
 (all laughing)

880
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:15,020
 But yeah, Serena tries to do this lawsuit

881
00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:16,780
 to say that you have to let me in, even though I'm 14.

882
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:18,420
 - So that was Serena was it?

883
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:19,980
 - Sorry, Serena did this lawsuit thing.

884
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:24,500
 - So at that stage, Venus will have already become pro, right?

885
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:26,820
 So maybe that was the reason, because yeah, in the movie,

886
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:30,060
 a lot of it is about how he doesn't want them to become pros.

887
00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:31,940
 He doesn't, he don't want them to play any matches

888
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:33,980
 until they become professional, really.

889
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:35,460
 They play when they're like 10 years old

890
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:37,340
 and then they don't play again until they're professional.

891
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:38,700
 - Except they play with him, don't they?

892
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:39,540
 - Well, they were a lot of practice.

893
00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:40,380
 - Practice, yeah.

894
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:42,380
 (all laughing)

895
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:44,580
 - They never touched a rocket again.

896
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:46,740
 - But how do you go pro without going up a system

897
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:47,580
 to get to the pro?

898
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:49,060
 - Well, they were so good.

899
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:53,380
 They basically had a pro, they had a trainer

900
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:54,620
 and they were really, really good.

901
00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:56,340
 And there was one game,

902
00:28:56,340 --> 00:28:57,900
 one of her first ever games, Venus,

903
00:28:57,900 --> 00:28:59,980
 she lost against the Rancho Sanchez Vicario,

904
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:01,380
 and this is part of the movie.

905
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:04,220
 And they kind of slightly changed what happened in the movie.

906
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:06,260
 But anyway, she lost this game

907
00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:08,180
 and then they interviewed her afterwards and said,

908
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:10,420
 "Well, you know, how is this loss

909
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:12,300
 against one of the best players in the world?

910
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:13,820
 How's it compared to the other times

911
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:14,980
 when you've lost in other games?"

912
00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:16,860
 And she went, "Well, I've never lost before."

913
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:18,500
 (all laughing)

914
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:21,140
 She'd never lost a match in any of her junior things.

915
00:29:21,140 --> 00:29:23,660
 And then she stopped playing and then she became pro.

916
00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:25,580
 And so, yeah, she'd never ever lost a match

917
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:26,420
 before at that stage.

918
00:29:26,420 --> 00:29:27,340
 - Amazing.

919
00:29:27,340 --> 00:29:29,060
 Yeah, so Richard, the dad,

920
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:32,300
 he basically decided that he was gonna turn his two girls.

921
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:33,300
 And he had a family before.

922
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:34,700
 This was his second marriage

923
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:37,460
 and two new kids to the family.

924
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:39,220
 He was watching TV and he saw that a tennis player

925
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:40,740
 could earn $40,000 a week.

926
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:42,300
 And he thought, "My God, that sounds amazing.

927
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:44,260
 I'm gonna train my girls up to do that."

928
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:46,940
 And he wrote up the 78-page training manual

929
00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:49,740
 for Serena and Venus that he had everything

930
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:52,580
 that he'd learned in there and how he needed them to be.

931
00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:54,140
 He did a really interesting thing.

932
00:29:54,140 --> 00:29:56,740
 And I say interesting, it's terrible.

933
00:29:56,740 --> 00:29:59,900
 He had his kids play Venus and Serena out in the public

934
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:03,340
 and he would pay local kids to come and jeer at them,

935
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:04,860
 to yell at them as they were playing

936
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:06,900
 so that they could get used to the idea of crowds

937
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:09,780
 being against them and having to push through it.

938
00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:12,060
 So there are people out there right now

939
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:15,900
 who have an anecdote, which is I was paid as a child

940
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:17,700
 to jeer at Serena.

941
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:22,940
 I think my family might have been doing that at fish gigs.

942
00:30:22,940 --> 00:30:24,340
 - What kind of prodigy were they attempting

943
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:26,220
 to turn you into and where did it go wrong?

944
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:36,060
 - Okay, it is time for fact number three and that is James.

945
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:39,340
 - Okay, my fact this week is that there is a tree in Pakistan

946
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:43,220
 that has been under arrest for more than 120 years.

947
00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:46,380
 - And still no charges brought?

948
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:50,220
 - No, that's Tony Blair levels of, you know,

949
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:51,300
 what's it called?

950
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:53,740
 The thing that Tony Blair did with habeas corpus suspension.

951
00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:55,820
 - That is such an obscure reference

952
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:58,300
 to Blair era home office policy.

953
00:30:58,300 --> 00:30:59,620
 - Guys, we all remember it.

954
00:30:59,620 --> 00:31:00,460
 - Oh, sorry.

955
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:01,300
 - And they're all still outraged.

956
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:02,140
 - Yep, sorry.

957
00:31:02,140 --> 00:31:07,180
 - Anyway, yes, apparently no habeas corpus

958
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:09,940
 when it comes to trees in Pakistan.

959
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:12,460
 This is, well, is this true?

960
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:14,620
 I mean, there is a tree.

961
00:31:14,620 --> 00:31:18,380
 There's a tree in Pakistan that is undoubtedly true.

962
00:31:18,380 --> 00:31:20,300
 It's a Banyan tree.

963
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:23,700
 It's undoubtedly true that the tree is chained up.

964
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:25,580
 And it's undoubtedly true that there is a board

965
00:31:25,580 --> 00:31:28,260
 on the tree that says I am under arrest.

966
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:30,860
 One evening a British officer heavily drunk

967
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:33,540
 thought I was moving from my original location

968
00:31:33,540 --> 00:31:35,980
 and ordered mess sergeant to arrest me.

969
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:38,540
 And since then I am under arrest.

970
00:31:38,540 --> 00:31:40,220
 All that is true.

971
00:31:40,220 --> 00:31:43,140
 This officer is supposedly called James Squid.

972
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:45,380
 I have no evidence that there was ever anyone

973
00:31:45,380 --> 00:31:46,220
 called James Squid.

974
00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:47,060
 - I looked as well.

975
00:31:47,060 --> 00:31:47,900
 I couldn't find any.

976
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:49,260
 - Nothing in the newspaper archives,

977
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:51,940
 nothing in old books, nothing.

978
00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:55,940
 - Also, it just feels like Squid wasn't anyone's surname.

979
00:31:55,940 --> 00:31:57,380
 - Well, it is.

980
00:31:57,380 --> 00:31:58,900
 There are people called Squid.

981
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:00,900
 I looked on one of those genealogy websites

982
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:01,780
 where you can see families.

983
00:32:01,780 --> 00:32:03,940
 Squid was a surname back in the day,

984
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:05,260
 but there's no notable Squids.

985
00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:07,180
 If you go to Wikipedia, notable Squids.

986
00:32:07,180 --> 00:32:08,340
 - Notable Squids, empty page.

987
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:09,180
 - Empty page.

988
00:32:09,180 --> 00:32:11,620
 - Wow, sorted out the Squids.

989
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:13,460
 - Jimmy Wales.

990
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:17,020
 - Well, he's only interested in the larger marine levels.

991
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:18,020
 - Wow, James Squid.

992
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:20,020
 - And this is a thing that certainly the people

993
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:21,700
 who live in the Landikatal,

994
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:23,780
 which is the place where this tree is,

995
00:32:23,780 --> 00:32:26,860
 which is in the Khyber region of northern Pakistan

996
00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:28,420
 near the border with Afghanistan,

997
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:30,740
 the people there, it's the story,

998
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:32,540
 the local story is that this happened.

999
00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:34,900
 And I think one reason possibly that it's still there

1000
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:39,300
 is they wanted to remind people of the colonial times

1001
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:42,540
 and the bad things that the British colonists

1002
00:32:42,540 --> 00:32:43,580
 brought to the area.

1003
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:45,140
 And yeah, remember the bad times.

1004
00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:45,980
 - I've got a question.

1005
00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:46,820
 - Yeah.

1006
00:32:46,820 --> 00:32:49,340
 - What's it chained to?

1007
00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:50,180
 - The ground.

1008
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:51,020
 - The ground, I see.

1009
00:32:51,020 --> 00:32:52,980
 And the reason it's changed to the ground

1010
00:32:52,980 --> 00:32:55,620
 is because so that it can't run away.

1011
00:32:55,620 --> 00:32:57,580
 Because the reason James Squid had it arrested

1012
00:32:57,580 --> 00:33:00,620
 is while he was riding home one night, it leapt at him.

1013
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:02,660
 It made a sudden movement.

1014
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:03,700
 And he's like, whoa there.

1015
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:05,340
 - It was quite a windy night, wasn't it?

1016
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:07,340
 (laughing)

1017
00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:09,820
 - So he claims drunkenly, supposedly drunkenly.

1018
00:33:09,820 --> 00:33:12,940
 And I say supposedly it's about a possible fictional human.

1019
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:14,700
 It's a possible fictional human.

1020
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:17,620
 - We don't even believe the fictional human's drunk story.

1021
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:19,460
 - It sounds like James Squid has a lot of questions

1022
00:33:19,460 --> 00:33:22,060
 to answer himself, but can't answer them.

1023
00:33:22,060 --> 00:33:23,260
 - Yeah, it's said to have.

1024
00:33:23,260 --> 00:33:25,180
 - Well, they can walk, can't they?

1025
00:33:25,180 --> 00:33:26,020
 - They can.

1026
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:28,620
 - So, and they do walk quite slowly.

1027
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:30,380
 - Sorry, could we unpack this a bit?

1028
00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:32,700
 - Yeah, so they possibly don't walk fast enough

1029
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:34,500
 to jump out at you on a dark night,

1030
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:36,900
 but they are an extraordinary tree.

1031
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:38,620
 They're known as Strangler Figs,

1032
00:33:38,620 --> 00:33:41,980
 because the way they grow is they start out as a seed

1033
00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:44,060
 that's put out of a bird or whatever,

1034
00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:46,220
 or blown onto the branch of another tree,

1035
00:33:46,220 --> 00:33:49,140
 and then they drop their roots from that branch.

1036
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:51,820
 - That's the crate, have you guys heard that before?

1037
00:33:51,820 --> 00:33:52,780
 I'd never heard of that.

1038
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:54,200
 That is extraordinary.

1039
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:56,940
 It just takes over a tree from the outside.

1040
00:33:56,940 --> 00:33:58,780
 - Yeah, it kills it.

1041
00:33:58,780 --> 00:34:02,880
 - Yes, and then it kills the inner tree.

1042
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:06,820
 The banyan then becomes what's called a columnar tree.

1043
00:34:06,820 --> 00:34:08,620
 So there's a hollow column in the middle of it

1044
00:34:08,620 --> 00:34:10,140
 where the previous tree was,

1045
00:34:10,140 --> 00:34:11,940
 and then all sorts of animals get to live

1046
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:13,540
 inside that hollow bit.

1047
00:34:13,540 --> 00:34:15,340
 - It's like the magic faraway tree.

1048
00:34:15,340 --> 00:34:16,180
 - But the walking.

1049
00:34:16,180 --> 00:34:17,180
 - Yeah, what's the walking?

1050
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:18,340
 I still don't believe they walk.

1051
00:34:18,340 --> 00:34:22,380
 - So the walking is if you've got your original root

1052
00:34:22,380 --> 00:34:25,300
 that's been dropped from the branch of a tree,

1053
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:28,060
 and that embeds itself, and that's essentially the trunk,

1054
00:34:28,060 --> 00:34:29,660
 and then it's rooted into the ground,

1055
00:34:29,660 --> 00:34:32,420
 and then it grows up again from the roots and it grows out.

1056
00:34:32,420 --> 00:34:34,860
 So you have these things that look like forests

1057
00:34:34,860 --> 00:34:37,300
 of lots of trees that are just one tree

1058
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:38,860
 because it keeps on growing up from the roots

1059
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:41,860
 and then dropping roots down again and then going up again.

1060
00:34:41,860 --> 00:34:46,100
 And then often the original trunk will get diseased

1061
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:47,900
 and have to be removed.

1062
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:49,580
 And then I say that that's walking

1063
00:34:49,580 --> 00:34:51,100
 because it's lifted up that leg

1064
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:53,100
 and taken it out of that position

1065
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:54,340
 and moved it to the next position.

1066
00:34:54,340 --> 00:34:55,420
 - It hasn't moved it to the next position,

1067
00:34:55,420 --> 00:34:56,260
 it's just been removed.

1068
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:57,620
 It's just died a bit apitated.

1069
00:34:57,620 --> 00:34:58,500
 - But the new trunk.

1070
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:00,340
 - It's grown another leg.

1071
00:35:00,340 --> 00:35:01,340
 - The roots that come down,

1072
00:35:01,340 --> 00:35:03,140
 one of those will become the major trunk.

1073
00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:03,980
 - Yes, that's right.

1074
00:35:03,980 --> 00:35:05,380
 I was forgetting that definition of walking

1075
00:35:05,380 --> 00:35:06,900
 where I have my leg apitated,

1076
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:07,980
 but then I grow a new leg,

1077
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:10,540
 which I put somewhere slightly different.

1078
00:35:10,540 --> 00:35:13,220
 And then do this a series of times over a century

1079
00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:15,140
 and end up going about 10 feet.

1080
00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:17,420
 Yes, walking, love to go for a walk.

1081
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:19,540
 (all laughing)

1082
00:35:19,540 --> 00:35:20,500
 - Look, when you're a tree,

1083
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:22,220
 you have to take everything you get, right?

1084
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:23,780
 - That's true, that's true.

1085
00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:24,620
 - It's not running.

1086
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:26,820
 (all laughing)

1087
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:29,500
 - I saw a massive banyan tree this morning.

1088
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:30,340
 - Yeah?

1089
00:35:30,340 --> 00:35:31,180
 - It's humongous, it's in India.

1090
00:35:31,180 --> 00:35:32,020
 - How big?

1091
00:35:32,020 --> 00:35:33,980
 - We're talking about 4.7 acres.

1092
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:35,540
 But this is how big it is,

1093
00:35:35,540 --> 00:35:37,300
 what Anna was mentioning about the idea

1094
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:39,980
 that these roots grow back out through the ground.

1095
00:35:39,980 --> 00:35:42,500
 So they're called aerial roots.

1096
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:43,820
 They look like their own trees.

1097
00:35:43,820 --> 00:35:45,900
 This one has 2,800 of them.

1098
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:47,100
 That's how many it's grown.

1099
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:49,340
 And the original trunk, like Anna was mentioning

1100
00:35:49,340 --> 00:35:50,220
 about the other one,

1101
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:52,020
 also has been diseased and chopped away.

1102
00:35:52,020 --> 00:35:54,540
 So even the original leg is no longer there.

1103
00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:55,660
 - They're pretty amazing.

1104
00:35:55,660 --> 00:35:56,900
 They're so big that these trees,

1105
00:35:56,900 --> 00:35:58,540
 these really, really massive ones,

1106
00:35:58,540 --> 00:36:01,060
 I reckon shelter 20,000 people.

1107
00:36:01,060 --> 00:36:02,660
 So let's say it's raining

1108
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:06,260
 and you're with 19,999 friends

1109
00:36:06,260 --> 00:36:07,300
 and you all need to keep dry.

1110
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:09,700
 You can just all slip underneath one of these trees.

1111
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:11,420
 - Or you're Jack Foley.

1112
00:36:11,420 --> 00:36:12,820
 You've just pulled off a job

1113
00:36:12,820 --> 00:36:14,140
 and you need to make it sound like

1114
00:36:14,140 --> 00:36:16,300
 there are 20,000 of you hiding under a tree.

1115
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:17,580
 (all laughing)

1116
00:36:17,580 --> 00:36:18,780
 Yeah, I understand.

1117
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:20,100
 - Yeah, yeah.

1118
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:21,940
 20,000 people though, that is a lot of people.

1119
00:36:21,940 --> 00:36:22,780
 - That's a lot.

1120
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:25,860
 - If you think of most lower division football stadiums,

1121
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:27,180
 Tremere Rovers who I support,

1122
00:36:27,180 --> 00:36:28,940
 like that's twice as many,

1123
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:30,380
 more than twice as many of people

1124
00:36:30,380 --> 00:36:31,820
 who go and watch Tremere every week.

1125
00:36:31,820 --> 00:36:34,220
 - So people could leave Tremere one week

1126
00:36:34,220 --> 00:36:35,500
 and all hide under the same tree

1127
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:38,100
 and the next week a completely different crowd of fans

1128
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:40,020
 could turn up, join the initial crowd

1129
00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:40,860
 under the previous tree.

1130
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:41,700
 - And the other crowd are like,

1131
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:43,260
 "What was the scar cause we just missed the match

1132
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:45,500
 cause we're hiding under this tree."

1133
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:47,660
 - Or in fact, cause I think the biggest one

1134
00:36:47,660 --> 00:36:49,500
 is about three football pitches.

1135
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:52,340
 So you could all crowd around the outside of the tree

1136
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:53,820
 and then three teams could play

1137
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:55,420
 three different matches underneath it.

1138
00:36:55,420 --> 00:36:56,820
 Although there are shed loads of branches in the way

1139
00:36:56,820 --> 00:36:57,980
 so actually that wouldn't work.

1140
00:36:57,980 --> 00:36:59,100
 - Hang on, three football pitches,

1141
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:01,420
 you can get six teams on there, can't you?

1142
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:02,620
 - That's such good football knowledge.

1143
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:03,660
 - I'm not a football expert

1144
00:37:03,660 --> 00:37:06,060
 but I think you can have two teams on the same pitch

1145
00:37:06,060 --> 00:37:07,500
 and it fits a really exciting match.

1146
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:09,740
 (laughing)

1147
00:37:09,740 --> 00:37:14,820
 - So there's a story that there's a prison

1148
00:37:14,820 --> 00:37:17,980
 in the Shabakodar area

1149
00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:20,220
 and it's called Shabakodar Fort.

1150
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:22,980
 And in the 1800s, 1840,

1151
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:24,740
 there was a group of warriors that attacked it

1152
00:37:24,740 --> 00:37:27,020
 and they went inside and there was a big clash

1153
00:37:27,020 --> 00:37:29,340
 and it went on all night long

1154
00:37:29,340 --> 00:37:32,180
 and the Sikh people who were in there fought back

1155
00:37:32,180 --> 00:37:34,260
 and they managed to get them out.

1156
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:35,700
 But there was this huge thing going,

1157
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:37,380
 "How the hell did they get in here?

1158
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:39,980
 "Someone's responsible for this, they need to pay."

1159
00:37:39,980 --> 00:37:42,820
 And so they had a big court case as it were,

1160
00:37:42,820 --> 00:37:46,140
 like a big inquisition into working out who did this.

1161
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:47,660
 And they came up with a verdict.

1162
00:37:47,660 --> 00:37:49,540
 And the verdict was it was the fault

1163
00:37:49,540 --> 00:37:52,180
 of the wooden doors that let them in.

1164
00:37:52,180 --> 00:37:55,060
 And as a result, the wooden doors have been arrested

1165
00:37:55,060 --> 00:37:56,620
 and have been hanging in the tower,

1166
00:37:56,620 --> 00:38:00,060
 chained up much like this tree ever since the 1840s

1167
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:01,500
 and they're still chained up.

1168
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:03,940
 - Wow, that's the scapegoat, isn't it?

1169
00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:05,220
 The scape door. - Yes.

1170
00:38:05,220 --> 00:38:06,780
 - Not the escape door.

1171
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:09,380
 That's awful if you try and get out through the scape door

1172
00:38:09,380 --> 00:38:11,500
 and you just walk into the door recently.

1173
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:15,820
 - So wow, this might be a thing,

1174
00:38:15,820 --> 00:38:20,300
 like a trend of chaining up trees or wood.

1175
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:21,140
 - Yes.

1176
00:38:21,140 --> 00:38:22,220
 - I've not heard of it happening anywhere else.

1177
00:38:22,220 --> 00:38:25,540
 I did look for arrested trees and you don't find any others.

1178
00:38:25,540 --> 00:38:29,020
 - No, no, and this slightly predates your tree as well

1179
00:38:29,020 --> 00:38:30,420
 by about 40 years or so.

1180
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:31,860
 - And also these are wooden doors,

1181
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:33,900
 so they were trees a lot before that.

1182
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:36,620
 - Yeah, we don't know how old the doors were.

1183
00:38:36,620 --> 00:38:38,300
 - We don't know.

1184
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:39,260
 - Food for thought.

1185
00:38:39,260 --> 00:38:44,460
 - Do some Banyan trees have bells hanging off them

1186
00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:47,260
 so you can ring the bell to access the spirit

1187
00:38:47,260 --> 00:38:48,100
 at the top of them?

1188
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:48,940
 - Cool.

1189
00:38:48,940 --> 00:38:52,220
 - What is the spirit, is it a helpful spirit?

1190
00:38:52,220 --> 00:38:53,540
 - Goddess, well they're very sacred.

1191
00:38:53,540 --> 00:38:55,420
 So yeah, it's a positive thing.

1192
00:38:55,420 --> 00:38:56,780
 There's lots of mythology around them

1193
00:38:56,780 --> 00:38:58,620
 'cause they are quite extraordinary trees.

1194
00:38:58,620 --> 00:39:01,180
 They feature quite heavily in Hindu mythology, in fact.

1195
00:39:01,180 --> 00:39:05,420
 I think there's Hindu texts from like 500 BC

1196
00:39:05,420 --> 00:39:08,900
 that say the entire universe is an upside down Banyan tree.

1197
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:12,860
 And so it's growing from the heavens down to us

1198
00:39:12,860 --> 00:39:14,980
 and then it's leaves a little aphorisms,

1199
00:39:14,980 --> 00:39:16,580
 little bits of wisdom.

1200
00:39:16,580 --> 00:39:20,140
 And there's, I mean, women wrap threads around them,

1201
00:39:20,140 --> 00:39:22,860
 don't they, there's a festival in India.

1202
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:27,740
 Vat Purnima, which I think means Banyan full moon

1203
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:30,220
 and married women go for three days

1204
00:39:30,220 --> 00:39:31,140
 and hang out with Banyan trees,

1205
00:39:31,140 --> 00:39:33,100
 wrapping threads around them as a way of--

1206
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:33,940
 - Why?

1207
00:39:33,940 --> 00:39:35,420
 - 'Cause they love their husband so much.

1208
00:39:35,420 --> 00:39:36,260
 It's pretty gross.

1209
00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:37,980
 - There is, yeah, a lot of it is,

1210
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:39,680
 it's a bit like, what do you call it,

1211
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:41,060
 like a Hindu almost, right?

1212
00:39:41,060 --> 00:39:42,780
 'Cause all the women go together.

1213
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:43,860
 - But a married woman, a Hindu.

1214
00:39:43,860 --> 00:39:45,460
 - But they're only married, yeah.

1215
00:39:45,460 --> 00:39:48,220
 - That's an, I reckon that's the next place

1216
00:39:48,220 --> 00:39:49,740
 for the Hindu market to go.

1217
00:39:49,740 --> 00:39:50,700
 - The Banyan trees?

1218
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:52,780
 - No, just like married Hindus.

1219
00:39:52,780 --> 00:39:54,940
 I think that could be a huge thing.

1220
00:39:54,940 --> 00:39:56,900
 - So what are you celebrating then?

1221
00:39:56,900 --> 00:39:58,420
 - Getting away from your husband for a bit, probably.

1222
00:39:58,420 --> 00:39:59,260
 - Yeah, nice.

1223
00:39:59,260 --> 00:40:00,260
 - How much you love him?

1224
00:40:00,260 --> 00:40:01,100
 - Oh, sorry, yeah.

1225
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:02,540
 Well, that's how it's sold,

1226
00:40:02,540 --> 00:40:03,860
 but everyone who goes on it knows

1227
00:40:03,860 --> 00:40:05,180
 we're going for a fun party.

1228
00:40:05,180 --> 00:40:06,660
 - Well, if we love our husband so much,

1229
00:40:06,660 --> 00:40:08,340
 why we go to a strip club in Blackpool?

1230
00:40:08,340 --> 00:40:11,220
 (all laughing)

1231
00:40:11,220 --> 00:40:13,180
 - There's a tree in the middle of it.

1232
00:40:13,180 --> 00:40:14,780
 - Stop tying ribbons to that.

1233
00:40:14,780 --> 00:40:16,460
 (all laughing)

1234
00:40:16,460 --> 00:40:17,460
 - To that guy's trunk.

1235
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:19,340
 (all laughing)

1236
00:40:19,340 --> 00:40:20,940
 Oh my God, he's got an aerial route.

1237
00:40:20,940 --> 00:40:23,520
 (upbeat music)

1238
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:29,780
 - Okay, it's time for our final fact of the show.

1239
00:40:29,780 --> 00:40:31,500
 That is Anna.

1240
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:33,540
 - My fact this week is that Pad Thai

1241
00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:37,580
 was invented as part of a fascist government initiative.

1242
00:40:37,580 --> 00:40:38,900
 - Wow.

1243
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:40,060
 - And every time you eat it,

1244
00:40:40,060 --> 00:40:41,900
 you are supporting fascism.

1245
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:42,740
 - Oh, shit.

1246
00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:45,260
 - Yeah, I know, awkward, 'cause it's delicious.

1247
00:40:45,260 --> 00:40:47,220
 - Well, this last time you all had Pad Thai,

1248
00:40:47,220 --> 00:40:49,780
 I reckon that I had it this weekend.

1249
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:50,620
 - About two weeks ago.

1250
00:40:50,620 --> 00:40:51,460
 - Yeah, same.

1251
00:40:51,460 --> 00:40:52,280
 - Yeah.

1252
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:53,620
 - I'm not sure I've ever had Pad Thai.

1253
00:40:53,620 --> 00:40:55,580
 - Well, you're very liberal out here.

1254
00:40:55,580 --> 00:40:56,980
 - 'Cause of my principles.

1255
00:40:56,980 --> 00:40:59,820
 (all laughing)

1256
00:40:59,820 --> 00:41:00,940
 - This is an amazing thing.

1257
00:41:00,940 --> 00:41:04,140
 It's from Thailand, hence the name.

1258
00:41:04,140 --> 00:41:06,540
 And it was essentially invented,

1259
00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:09,620
 sort of by the leader of Thailand,

1260
00:41:09,620 --> 00:41:12,900
 a guy called Phoeban, full name Luang Phoeban Songkram.

1261
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:15,820
 And he was a big populist leader in the 1930s,

1262
00:41:15,820 --> 00:41:19,060
 that era of big populist leaders who became fascists.

1263
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:19,900
 And so--

1264
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:21,260
 - Thank God we got out of that era.

1265
00:41:21,260 --> 00:41:22,300
 (all laughing)

1266
00:41:22,300 --> 00:41:23,920
 - Well, indeed.

1267
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:25,620
 - How times have changed.

1268
00:41:25,620 --> 00:41:30,140
 And he became essentially dictator of Thailand in 1938.

1269
00:41:30,140 --> 00:41:33,160
 And he was very anti-China, a very nationalist,

1270
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:36,140
 as was the way with sort of fascist-leaning dictators.

1271
00:41:36,140 --> 00:41:39,620
 And he wanted to stamp tiness onto everything

1272
00:41:39,620 --> 00:41:41,380
 and make everything very Thai.

1273
00:41:41,380 --> 00:41:43,420
 There were loads of Chinese people in Thailand at the time.

1274
00:41:43,420 --> 00:41:46,060
 They tended to sell most of the street food, for instance.

1275
00:41:46,060 --> 00:41:48,260
 So all the food had Chinese influences.

1276
00:41:48,260 --> 00:41:51,300
 He wanted to scratch that and create this new dish.

1277
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:54,020
 And it's not totally clear who invented it.

1278
00:41:54,020 --> 00:41:56,940
 His son claims that it was in their household

1279
00:41:56,940 --> 00:41:58,660
 that it was invented and they used to have it

1280
00:41:58,660 --> 00:41:59,780
 as a family together.

1281
00:41:59,780 --> 00:42:02,500
 Other people say maybe he ran a competition to invent it.

1282
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:05,380
 But essentially, he published and promoted this recipe

1283
00:42:05,380 --> 00:42:08,940
 for Pad Thai to incorporate lots of nice Thai tweaks

1284
00:42:08,940 --> 00:42:10,500
 and made everyone eat it.

1285
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:11,340
 - That's interesting.

1286
00:42:11,340 --> 00:42:13,580
 I did read that it's not Thai,

1287
00:42:13,580 --> 00:42:17,500
 that it's a Chinese meal which has been sort of adopted.

1288
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:18,340
 - Did you see that?

1289
00:42:18,340 --> 00:42:22,260
 - Well, it is because China and Thailand

1290
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:24,380
 are all kind of noodle or rice-based stuff.

1291
00:42:24,380 --> 00:42:26,380
 It does use Chinese noodles.

1292
00:42:26,380 --> 00:42:28,940
 It basically took Chinese noodle dishes

1293
00:42:28,940 --> 00:42:30,780
 and added lots of tiness to it.

1294
00:42:30,780 --> 00:42:34,300
 So the Thai bits are things like the palm sugar,

1295
00:42:34,300 --> 00:42:35,860
 that real nice sweet sugariness,

1296
00:42:35,860 --> 00:42:37,860
 the chili tamarind flavor that you get.

1297
00:42:37,860 --> 00:42:38,700
 That was all Thai.

1298
00:42:38,700 --> 00:42:40,140
 - Also, bean sprouts, you don't really,

1299
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:42,780
 is very Thai, which is on top.

1300
00:42:42,780 --> 00:42:44,340
 - But yeah, it wasn't like a pizza.

1301
00:42:44,340 --> 00:42:45,540
 They had to work with what they had.

1302
00:42:45,540 --> 00:42:48,420
 And what they had was the same ingredients as Chinese food.

1303
00:42:48,420 --> 00:42:51,780
 - Yeah, actually, you were saying about the food vendors,

1304
00:42:51,780 --> 00:42:54,540
 all being Chinese, any foreign food vendors

1305
00:42:54,540 --> 00:42:56,340
 were banned by Phoeban.

1306
00:42:56,340 --> 00:42:57,540
 They said, "You're not allowed to do that."

1307
00:42:57,540 --> 00:43:00,300
 And the government kind of bought a load of food carts

1308
00:43:00,300 --> 00:43:02,900
 and then got people to run them and said,

1309
00:43:02,900 --> 00:43:06,460
 "Right, you've got to sell Pad Thai from these food carts."

1310
00:43:06,460 --> 00:43:09,260
 They made it so that everyone had to eat

1311
00:43:09,260 --> 00:43:10,740
 at certain times every day

1312
00:43:10,740 --> 00:43:13,900
 and you were allowed no more than four meals a day

1313
00:43:13,900 --> 00:43:17,300
 because this was the Thai way as opposed to the Chinese way.

1314
00:43:17,300 --> 00:43:18,140
 You were supposed to--

1315
00:43:18,140 --> 00:43:18,960
 - It's not that rigorous, is it?

1316
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:22,460
 - How many meals a day?

1317
00:43:22,460 --> 00:43:25,140
 - I was like, "Well, snacks are allowed."

1318
00:43:25,140 --> 00:43:26,980
 - I think that might not be, I don't think so.

1319
00:43:26,980 --> 00:43:29,140
 - I have some pretty hefty snacks.

1320
00:43:29,140 --> 00:43:30,340
 I only have three meals a day,

1321
00:43:30,340 --> 00:43:32,540
 but if you add in snacks, I'm shading snacks.

1322
00:43:32,540 --> 00:43:33,460
 - I think you're not allowed,

1323
00:43:33,460 --> 00:43:36,500
 you wouldn't be allowed in 1930s Thailand.

1324
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:39,060
 He was the one who changed the name to Thailand from Siam.

1325
00:43:39,060 --> 00:43:39,980
 - Yes.

1326
00:43:39,980 --> 00:43:41,820
 - He mandated that everyone had to sleep

1327
00:43:41,820 --> 00:43:43,620
 six to eight hours a day,

1328
00:43:43,620 --> 00:43:45,300
 which apparently was also a Thai thing

1329
00:43:45,300 --> 00:43:46,420
 as opposed to a Chinese thing.

1330
00:43:46,420 --> 00:43:48,500
 And he said that everyone had to wear hats.

1331
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:50,740
 - How was the Chinese eating 15 meals a day

1332
00:43:50,740 --> 00:43:51,980
 and sleeping for 21 hours?

1333
00:43:51,980 --> 00:43:53,780
 - It appears that way.

1334
00:43:53,780 --> 00:43:54,900
 - It wasn't even just hats.

1335
00:43:54,900 --> 00:43:56,860
 You had to make sure you wore shoes.

1336
00:43:56,860 --> 00:43:59,740
 If there were photos of people without hats and shoes in them,

1337
00:43:59,740 --> 00:44:02,340
 they were painted on onto the actual photo itself.

1338
00:44:02,340 --> 00:44:03,180
 - Really?

1339
00:44:03,180 --> 00:44:05,260
 - Yeah, all these, he made sure that,

1340
00:44:05,260 --> 00:44:07,060
 and this was an order that you had to kiss.

1341
00:44:07,060 --> 00:44:08,380
 This is if you were a male worker,

1342
00:44:08,380 --> 00:44:11,100
 you had to kiss your wife before you left for work.

1343
00:44:11,100 --> 00:44:12,980
 That was part of the mandate.

1344
00:44:12,980 --> 00:44:15,300
 - I do think that's nice.

1345
00:44:15,300 --> 00:44:18,620
 - If you have to, it takes the meaning off it.

1346
00:44:18,620 --> 00:44:19,460
 - You're absolutely right.

1347
00:44:19,460 --> 00:44:21,620
 - If you go to work and give your wife a kiss

1348
00:44:21,620 --> 00:44:23,420
 and she knows that if you don't do it,

1349
00:44:23,420 --> 00:44:24,420
 you're gonna be arrested.

1350
00:44:24,420 --> 00:44:26,260
 I think it takes a lot of love out there.

1351
00:44:26,260 --> 00:44:27,660
 - And sometimes you've had a tiff

1352
00:44:27,660 --> 00:44:30,260
 and you actually want to make a point.

1353
00:44:30,260 --> 00:44:31,100
 - Yeah.

1354
00:44:31,100 --> 00:44:33,500
 - And you're like, I hate you so much.

1355
00:44:33,500 --> 00:44:34,740
 I'm willing to be arrested

1356
00:44:34,740 --> 00:44:37,220
 by the fascist governments of Thailand.

1357
00:44:37,220 --> 00:44:40,340
 - That actually really makes the point much more effectively.

1358
00:44:40,340 --> 00:44:43,980
 They're just saying, sorry, train, gotta go, gotta go.

1359
00:44:43,980 --> 00:44:45,300
 - Well, the reason we all think it's nice

1360
00:44:45,300 --> 00:44:46,580
 is 'cause we are Westerners

1361
00:44:46,580 --> 00:44:47,900
 and that's why he was trying to--

1362
00:44:47,900 --> 00:44:49,220
 - Oh, he was trying to Westernize.

1363
00:44:49,220 --> 00:44:52,420
 - Yeah, it was just absolutely bang on classic,

1364
00:44:52,420 --> 00:44:54,940
 but like desperately trying to Westernize and modernize,

1365
00:44:54,940 --> 00:44:57,860
 partly because, partly our fault he came about

1366
00:44:57,860 --> 00:45:00,980
 because Thailand or Siam had never been conquered,

1367
00:45:00,980 --> 00:45:03,060
 never really been colonized by the West

1368
00:45:03,060 --> 00:45:04,540
 unlike pretty much everywhere else in that area.

1369
00:45:04,540 --> 00:45:06,620
 - Sounds like it was explicitly not our fault.

1370
00:45:06,620 --> 00:45:07,940
 - No, but wait for it.

1371
00:45:07,940 --> 00:45:08,780
 - Oh, no.

1372
00:45:08,780 --> 00:45:10,380
 It felt like they were in danger of being colonized

1373
00:45:10,380 --> 00:45:12,380
 'cause we weren't over that phase of history at the time

1374
00:45:12,380 --> 00:45:14,140
 and they were like, the reason we haven't been colonized

1375
00:45:14,140 --> 00:45:16,420
 is because we're really cultured, we're civilized,

1376
00:45:16,420 --> 00:45:18,860
 you know, Westerners think that we don't need to be colonized

1377
00:45:18,860 --> 00:45:21,420
 and we need to kind of persuade the West

1378
00:45:21,420 --> 00:45:24,660
 not to invade us by Westernizing and modernizing massively

1379
00:45:24,660 --> 00:45:26,420
 and that's gonna mean kissing our wives

1380
00:45:26,420 --> 00:45:29,780
 and that's why the Brits didn't invade Thailand.

1381
00:45:29,780 --> 00:45:32,180
 We saw they were kissing their wives as they left

1382
00:45:32,180 --> 00:45:34,500
 and that was the idea.

1383
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:35,780
 - And wearing hats.

1384
00:45:35,780 --> 00:45:37,140
 - And wearing hats, yeah.

1385
00:45:37,140 --> 00:45:38,620
 - Can't possibly arrest all these good chaps

1386
00:45:38,620 --> 00:45:40,660
 who are going around wearing hats and kissing their wives.

1387
00:45:40,660 --> 00:45:41,500
 - Precisely.

1388
00:45:41,500 --> 00:45:42,340
 - Wow.

1389
00:45:42,340 --> 00:45:43,780
 - You've got a British mentality of the 1930s.

1390
00:45:43,780 --> 00:45:45,940
 - Yeah, it's not the first time I've heard that either.

1391
00:45:45,940 --> 00:45:48,620
 - He banned listening to American and European music though.

1392
00:45:48,620 --> 00:45:50,060
 Why would he do that?

1393
00:45:50,060 --> 00:45:53,460
 - Well, again, he wanted to get the Thai culture.

1394
00:45:53,460 --> 00:45:54,780
 - Okay, I guess so.

1395
00:45:54,780 --> 00:45:56,660
 - He ordered every single household

1396
00:45:56,660 --> 00:45:58,380
 to have a picture of him in their homes,

1397
00:45:58,380 --> 00:46:01,860
 classic fascist behavior, that's vintage stuff

1398
00:46:01,860 --> 00:46:04,620
 and also theater and cinema audiences

1399
00:46:04,620 --> 00:46:06,260
 had to bow to an image of him

1400
00:46:06,260 --> 00:46:08,940
 before each viewing of the screening of the film

1401
00:46:08,940 --> 00:46:10,220
 or the performance of the play.

1402
00:46:10,220 --> 00:46:11,060
 - Really?

1403
00:46:11,060 --> 00:46:14,660
 - Oh, well that's fine, 'cause 1930s cinema and theater.

1404
00:46:14,660 --> 00:46:15,620
 - You had to bow to Boris Johnson

1405
00:46:15,620 --> 00:46:17,100
 before you see one man, two governors.

1406
00:46:17,100 --> 00:46:19,820
 - You got to stand up and sing "God Save the Queen"

1407
00:46:19,820 --> 00:46:21,100
 in the cinemas before a movie

1408
00:46:21,100 --> 00:46:23,380
 and at the end of the movie, that's what happened here.

1409
00:46:23,380 --> 00:46:24,740
 Like, it's not any different.

1410
00:46:24,740 --> 00:46:27,020
 - They said that same thing, yeah.

1411
00:46:27,020 --> 00:46:29,740
 He had to use forks and spoons, national cutlery,

1412
00:46:29,740 --> 00:46:31,220
 got rid of chopsticks.

1413
00:46:31,220 --> 00:46:34,260
 Again, it's this weird hybrid of persuading the West

1414
00:46:34,260 --> 00:46:35,660
 that we're Westernized and modern,

1415
00:46:35,660 --> 00:46:37,660
 but also keeping real Tainas.

1416
00:46:37,660 --> 00:46:39,340
 Typhoon with forks and spoons.

1417
00:46:39,340 --> 00:46:41,820
 And also, they went through all these popular songs

1418
00:46:41,820 --> 00:46:44,380
 and they took out, if any popular folk songs

1419
00:46:44,380 --> 00:46:46,740
 mentioned other ethnicities that weren't Thai,

1420
00:46:46,740 --> 00:46:48,220
 they were rewritten.

1421
00:46:48,220 --> 00:46:50,660
 So, if you were Lao or if you were Burmese,

1422
00:46:50,660 --> 00:46:51,740
 'cause there were lots of different ethnicities

1423
00:46:51,740 --> 00:46:55,340
 in Thailand at the time, then couldn't sing it anymore.

1424
00:46:55,340 --> 00:46:56,700
 - Really? - Wow.

1425
00:46:56,700 --> 00:46:59,500
 - So if you had the song "The Irish Rover",

1426
00:46:59,500 --> 00:47:01,420
 did they rewrite it as the Thai Rover?

1427
00:47:01,420 --> 00:47:02,940
 - Yeah, and that was one of the most popular songs

1428
00:47:02,940 --> 00:47:03,780
 at the time.

1429
00:47:03,780 --> 00:47:05,220
 (laughing)

1430
00:47:05,220 --> 00:47:06,500
 - I don't think of any other songs

1431
00:47:06,500 --> 00:47:08,180
 which had an ethnicity of them.

1432
00:47:08,180 --> 00:47:09,180
 - See.

1433
00:47:09,180 --> 00:47:11,980
 - But so, they would send the artist back into the studio.

1434
00:47:11,980 --> 00:47:13,820
 It wouldn't be like the DJ at the radio station

1435
00:47:13,820 --> 00:47:16,180
 would just come in and just say a new word

1436
00:47:16,180 --> 00:47:17,660
 over a song playing.

1437
00:47:17,660 --> 00:47:19,580
 - Well, this is where Andy's Foley Artist comes in,

1438
00:47:19,580 --> 00:47:20,420
 isn't it?

1439
00:47:20,420 --> 00:47:23,380
 They employed Jack Foley to say the word Thai

1440
00:47:23,380 --> 00:47:25,620
 over everything else.

1441
00:47:25,620 --> 00:47:26,900
 - Actually, it doesn't sound like Thai

1442
00:47:26,900 --> 00:47:27,900
 if you say the word Thai.

1443
00:47:27,900 --> 00:47:29,380
 You have to say the word Swiss,

1444
00:47:29,380 --> 00:47:31,900
 because that better creates the sound of the word Thai.

1445
00:47:31,900 --> 00:47:33,700
 (laughing)

1446
00:47:33,700 --> 00:47:35,540
 - Anyway, it was a fascist bad guy.

1447
00:47:35,540 --> 00:47:36,380
 - Yeah.

1448
00:47:36,380 --> 00:47:37,860
 - They had a noodles song as well.

1449
00:47:37,860 --> 00:47:38,700
 - Oh, yeah.

1450
00:47:38,700 --> 00:47:40,620
 - Yeah, yeah, Thai, 'cause it's, do you wanna hear it?

1451
00:47:40,620 --> 00:47:41,460
 - Yes, please.

1452
00:47:41,460 --> 00:47:42,300
 - It sounds so fun.

1453
00:47:42,300 --> 00:47:43,580
 - I love two, three, four.

1454
00:47:43,580 --> 00:47:46,220
 - Noodles, noodles, noodles, it's how it starts.

1455
00:47:46,220 --> 00:47:48,140
 Thai vegetables are wealth in the ground.

1456
00:47:48,140 --> 00:47:49,460
 You can find it anywhere.

1457
00:47:49,460 --> 00:47:51,220
 Keep buying and selling as Thai people

1458
00:47:51,220 --> 00:47:52,180
 always help each other.

1459
00:47:52,180 --> 00:47:53,180
 Noodles, noodles.

1460
00:47:53,180 --> 00:47:55,140
 I imagine something's been lost in translation,

1461
00:47:55,140 --> 00:47:58,260
 but the tune.

1462
00:47:58,260 --> 00:48:00,500
 (laughing)

1463
00:48:00,500 --> 00:48:01,780
 - Do you know we've only just worked out

1464
00:48:01,780 --> 00:48:03,540
 how to break a noodle in half?

1465
00:48:03,540 --> 00:48:04,540
 (laughing)

1466
00:48:04,540 --> 00:48:05,380
 - Not true.

1467
00:48:05,380 --> 00:48:07,860
 - Scientists have, well, okay, 2018.

1468
00:48:07,860 --> 00:48:10,100
 (laughing)

1469
00:48:10,100 --> 00:48:13,540
 Four years ago, this is like a straight noodle

1470
00:48:13,540 --> 00:48:14,540
 or a bit of spaghetti,

1471
00:48:14,540 --> 00:48:17,900
 and it's just impossible to snap it in half

1472
00:48:17,900 --> 00:48:18,740
 if you try doing it.

1473
00:48:18,740 --> 00:48:19,580
 - Oh, yeah.

1474
00:48:19,580 --> 00:48:20,420
 - It's really interesting.

1475
00:48:20,420 --> 00:48:21,260
 If you're at home now,

1476
00:48:21,260 --> 00:48:23,540
 like get a piece of long piece of spaghetti,

1477
00:48:23,540 --> 00:48:24,380
 a long spaghetti.

1478
00:48:24,380 --> 00:48:25,460
 (laughing)

1479
00:48:25,460 --> 00:48:28,340
 You hold both ends of it and then start to bend, right?

1480
00:48:28,340 --> 00:48:29,660
 Until it snaps,

1481
00:48:29,660 --> 00:48:31,860
 you'll find that the two bits in your hand

1482
00:48:31,860 --> 00:48:33,100
 stay in your hand,

1483
00:48:33,100 --> 00:48:35,180
 and then the bit in the middle comes out,

1484
00:48:35,180 --> 00:48:37,260
 so it doesn't break into two pieces.

1485
00:48:37,260 --> 00:48:38,300
 It always breaks into three.

1486
00:48:38,300 --> 00:48:39,140
 It's really interesting.

1487
00:48:39,140 --> 00:48:39,980
 - That is interesting.

1488
00:48:39,980 --> 00:48:41,780
 Although if you hold it in the middle, you can.

1489
00:48:41,780 --> 00:48:42,620
 - Yeah, yeah.

1490
00:48:42,620 --> 00:48:44,540
 - That's what they learned in 2018.

1491
00:48:44,540 --> 00:48:46,860
 (laughing)

1492
00:48:46,860 --> 00:48:47,780
 - Andy, if only you'd been there.

1493
00:48:47,780 --> 00:48:50,340
 I mean, you could have saved thousands of pounds.

1494
00:48:50,340 --> 00:48:51,180
 - Yeah.

1495
00:48:51,180 --> 00:48:52,940
 - So I think I'm a really famous scientist.

1496
00:48:52,940 --> 00:48:54,380
 - Richard Feynman was,

1497
00:48:54,380 --> 00:48:55,740
 he was obsessed with this problem.

1498
00:48:55,740 --> 00:48:58,460
 So he used to stay up all night,

1499
00:48:58,460 --> 00:49:01,380
 repeatedly snapping strands of spaghetti.

1500
00:49:01,380 --> 00:49:04,220
 Incredibly famous physicists, Richard Feynman.

1501
00:49:04,220 --> 00:49:05,780
 - And he died in what, the 80s or 90s,

1502
00:49:05,780 --> 00:49:09,700
 so he never, he's not alive to the graduate.

1503
00:49:09,700 --> 00:49:12,780
 See the 2018 innovation, what happened?

1504
00:49:12,780 --> 00:49:14,380
 - Well, he died clutching a noodle.

1505
00:49:14,380 --> 00:49:17,620
 It flew into his eye and through to his brain.

1506
00:49:17,620 --> 00:49:21,820
 We figured out why you can't do it in 2006,

1507
00:49:21,820 --> 00:49:24,060
 and that's to do with this kickback wave

1508
00:49:24,060 --> 00:49:26,340
 that travels through the spaghetti when you snap it

1509
00:49:26,340 --> 00:49:27,780
 and smashes it up.

1510
00:49:27,780 --> 00:49:30,340
 But it then took another 12 years

1511
00:49:30,340 --> 00:49:31,940
 to figure out how to overcome it.

1512
00:49:31,940 --> 00:49:36,780
 The way you overcome it is you twist the spaghetti 280 degrees.

1513
00:49:36,780 --> 00:49:39,860
 So almost a full all the way around.

1514
00:49:39,860 --> 00:49:43,540
 And then you break it gently, slowly.

1515
00:49:43,540 --> 00:49:45,460
 And that solves your problem.

1516
00:49:45,460 --> 00:49:47,980
 - Yeah, I think if you are at home and you do try that,

1517
00:49:47,980 --> 00:49:50,860
 sometimes you break it and it does go into two

1518
00:49:50,860 --> 00:49:52,340
 and you're really disappointed.

1519
00:49:52,340 --> 00:49:54,620
 But I think that might be because you've got either too much

1520
00:49:54,620 --> 00:49:56,540
 or too little moisture in your spaghetti.

1521
00:49:56,540 --> 00:49:58,540
 - Yeah, if you try it just without the twist.

1522
00:49:58,540 --> 00:49:59,820
 - I'm just saying, don't write it.

1523
00:49:59,820 --> 00:50:02,580
 If you break your spaghetti and it breaks it's too straight away,

1524
00:50:02,580 --> 00:50:03,420
 then don't write it.

1525
00:50:03,420 --> 00:50:05,020
 - It's your fault is what we're saying.

1526
00:50:05,020 --> 00:50:05,980
 Yeah, yeah.

1527
00:50:05,980 --> 00:50:09,260
 So are there any, it feels like a stupid question.

1528
00:50:09,260 --> 00:50:11,060
 Are there any applications for this?

1529
00:50:11,060 --> 00:50:12,460
 - Got loads.

1530
00:50:12,460 --> 00:50:13,300
 - Yeah, yeah.

1531
00:50:13,300 --> 00:50:16,380
 - But that's pretty much time to go through.

1532
00:50:16,380 --> 00:50:20,820
 - Probably military, PAE systems have probably bought it.

1533
00:50:20,820 --> 00:50:23,460
 - You make drones out of a snap spaghetti now, yeah.

1534
00:50:23,460 --> 00:50:25,980
 - Is it the same principle for anything

1535
00:50:25,980 --> 00:50:27,260
 that is one big long stick?

1536
00:50:27,260 --> 00:50:30,980
 As in I'm trying to think of someone doing a pole vote.

1537
00:50:30,980 --> 00:50:31,820
 No, sorry.

1538
00:50:31,820 --> 00:50:32,660
 - A pole vote.

1539
00:50:32,660 --> 00:50:33,500
 - No, no, I think pole.

1540
00:50:33,500 --> 00:50:35,580
 - Yeah, yeah, a vaulting pole.

1541
00:50:35,580 --> 00:50:37,900
 They're at one end and we do see them snap

1542
00:50:37,900 --> 00:50:40,060
 and they tend to snap in two, I think.

1543
00:50:40,060 --> 00:50:40,900
 - Do they snap?

1544
00:50:40,900 --> 00:50:43,340
 - Yeah, they have snapped from time to time.

1545
00:50:43,340 --> 00:50:45,100
 No, I think it's because the spaghetti

1546
00:50:45,100 --> 00:50:47,380
 has got a certain tensile strength that it works,

1547
00:50:47,380 --> 00:50:50,300
 but particularly well with that, I think.

1548
00:50:50,300 --> 00:50:52,900
 - Okay, how about in the last year,

1549
00:50:52,900 --> 00:50:57,900
 a woman was burgled in a helicopter was dispatched

1550
00:50:57,900 --> 00:50:59,100
 to the scene of this burglary.

1551
00:50:59,100 --> 00:51:00,420
 - Yeah, right.

1552
00:51:00,420 --> 00:51:03,700
 - That's a, so it wasn't in Britain then, oh.

1553
00:51:03,700 --> 00:51:04,940
 - No, it was because of police funding.

1554
00:51:04,940 --> 00:51:05,780
 - Yeah, yeah.

1555
00:51:05,780 --> 00:51:07,940
 - Yeah, and the only thing is.

1556
00:51:07,940 --> 00:51:09,820
 - We were allowed to make references to Tony Blair's

1557
00:51:09,820 --> 00:51:11,660
 home office, "Happiest Corpus" policies,

1558
00:51:11,660 --> 00:51:13,620
 but I'm not allowed to comment on police cuts now.

1559
00:51:13,620 --> 00:51:16,220
 - Can you just say how many police cuts

1560
00:51:16,220 --> 00:51:17,700
 do you think you would not have to have

1561
00:51:17,700 --> 00:51:19,540
 before we could get a helicopter

1562
00:51:19,540 --> 00:51:21,660
 going to every burglary that happens?

1563
00:51:21,660 --> 00:51:22,500
 - All I'm saying is, James,

1564
00:51:22,500 --> 00:51:23,340
 this is a stand for election,

1565
00:51:23,340 --> 00:51:25,420
 that's going to be one of my flagship policies,

1566
00:51:25,420 --> 00:51:27,780
 chopper at your house within seven minutes

1567
00:51:27,780 --> 00:51:29,780
 of the burglary happening.

1568
00:51:29,780 --> 00:51:32,620
 - Well this actually, this story does weak

1569
00:51:32,620 --> 00:51:33,940
 of an overfunded police force,

1570
00:51:33,940 --> 00:51:35,380
 because the only things that were stolen

1571
00:51:35,380 --> 00:51:36,780
 were eight pot noodles.

1572
00:51:36,780 --> 00:51:40,420
 Not just individual noodles,

1573
00:51:40,420 --> 00:51:41,660
 pot noodles, but like, you know.

1574
00:51:41,660 --> 00:51:42,820
 - They dispatched a helicopter.

1575
00:51:42,820 --> 00:51:44,860
 - Packets, I don't think they knew at the time

1576
00:51:44,860 --> 00:51:46,580
 that it was just pot noodles that had been taken

1577
00:51:46,580 --> 00:51:47,420
 and women just saw.

1578
00:51:47,420 --> 00:51:49,300
 - Was this woman the queen?

1579
00:51:49,300 --> 00:51:51,300
 - Yeah, she loved.

1580
00:51:51,300 --> 00:51:53,700
 - So we learned earlier that they were using helicopters

1581
00:51:53,700 --> 00:51:55,700
 to lift up pilchards from the water.

1582
00:51:55,700 --> 00:51:57,220
 - Yeah, nutty knower.

1583
00:51:57,220 --> 00:51:58,740
 - So you know, and it's like,

1584
00:51:58,740 --> 00:52:00,060
 - What are you saying, we've got spare helicopters

1585
00:52:00,060 --> 00:52:00,900
 coming out of our ears?

1586
00:52:00,900 --> 00:52:01,740
 - Seems like it.

1587
00:52:01,740 --> 00:52:03,620
 - Yeah, I think she didn't know at the time

1588
00:52:03,620 --> 00:52:05,180
 she just saw this burglar in her garden

1589
00:52:05,180 --> 00:52:06,820
 having leapt out of her house, I guess,

1590
00:52:06,820 --> 00:52:08,340
 called the police, they were like,

1591
00:52:08,340 --> 00:52:09,820
 oh God, emergency.

1592
00:52:09,820 --> 00:52:12,260
 And it was only later when they interviewed her,

1593
00:52:12,260 --> 00:52:13,260
 they said, what's been taken?

1594
00:52:13,260 --> 00:52:15,460
 And she said, well, actually eight pot noodles.

1595
00:52:15,460 --> 00:52:17,180
 And she said they took all the beef

1596
00:52:17,180 --> 00:52:18,420
 and tomato flavored ones,

1597
00:52:18,420 --> 00:52:20,660
 but didn't take the chicken and mushroom ones.

1598
00:52:20,660 --> 00:52:24,380
 - Really, that, yeah, I understand that.

1599
00:52:24,380 --> 00:52:25,860
 - I was going to say, yeah.

1600
00:52:25,860 --> 00:52:29,940
 - Have you heard of Watana Panic?

1601
00:52:29,940 --> 00:52:30,780
 - Say it again.

1602
00:52:30,780 --> 00:52:31,620
 - Watana Panic.

1603
00:52:31,620 --> 00:52:32,460
 - No.

1604
00:52:32,460 --> 00:52:35,140
 - Watana, it's in Thailand.

1605
00:52:35,140 --> 00:52:37,740
 It's a noodle soup joint.

1606
00:52:37,740 --> 00:52:41,180
 Maybe the Watana family, I don't know.

1607
00:52:41,180 --> 00:52:43,740
 But it's a place where you can buy noodle soup

1608
00:52:43,740 --> 00:52:47,060
 and they're one of these places where every day

1609
00:52:47,060 --> 00:52:49,300
 they take the last bit of the previous soup

1610
00:52:49,300 --> 00:52:53,260
 and put it into the next soup, like a perpetual soup.

1611
00:52:53,260 --> 00:52:54,980
 And so whenever you, whatever you buy,

1612
00:52:54,980 --> 00:52:56,900
 if you get some of this beef noodles,

1613
00:52:56,900 --> 00:52:59,460
 you might be having stuff from, you know,

1614
00:52:59,460 --> 00:53:00,740
 50 years ago.

1615
00:53:00,740 --> 00:53:01,580
 Isn't it cool?

1616
00:53:01,580 --> 00:53:02,420
 - That's really cool.

1617
00:53:02,420 --> 00:53:03,540
 - How long it's been going on?

1618
00:53:03,540 --> 00:53:06,260
 - It's been going three generations.

1619
00:53:06,260 --> 00:53:09,340
 We think 45 years and counting.

1620
00:53:09,340 --> 00:53:12,620
 But I was reading about these perpetual soups

1621
00:53:12,620 --> 00:53:14,460
 and there's some claims.

1622
00:53:14,460 --> 00:53:17,900
 One of them apparently, there was,

1623
00:53:17,900 --> 00:53:20,300
 there's one story that there was a perpetual stew

1624
00:53:20,300 --> 00:53:22,300
 in Perpignan in France

1625
00:53:22,300 --> 00:53:25,500
 that was going from the 15th century until World War Two.

1626
00:53:25,500 --> 00:53:28,860
 - What, then the Nazis bombed it?

1627
00:53:28,860 --> 00:53:31,740
 - They ran out of ingredients due to the German occupation

1628
00:53:31,740 --> 00:53:33,820
 and had to stop the stew.

1629
00:53:33,820 --> 00:53:34,860
 - You could just water it.

1630
00:53:34,860 --> 00:53:36,460
 I would have thought you just water it down

1631
00:53:36,460 --> 00:53:38,020
 until it's basically water,

1632
00:53:38,020 --> 00:53:40,580
 but keep the stew technically, it's still the stew.

1633
00:53:40,580 --> 00:53:42,260
 But you've got bigger things on your mind

1634
00:53:42,260 --> 00:53:44,420
 when the Nazis are rolling in, so that's fair enough.

1635
00:53:44,420 --> 00:53:45,260
 - Yeah, you do.

1636
00:53:45,260 --> 00:53:47,420
 There was one in Normandy

1637
00:53:47,420 --> 00:53:49,260
 that apparently was over 300 years old.

1638
00:53:49,260 --> 00:53:50,700
 This is kind of turned,

1639
00:53:50,700 --> 00:53:54,180
 this is an article in a newspaper called The Navhyn Times,

1640
00:53:54,180 --> 00:53:55,340
 which is from Goa.

1641
00:53:55,340 --> 00:53:56,620
 I couldn't find it anywhere else,

1642
00:53:56,620 --> 00:53:58,340
 so God knows if this is true.

1643
00:53:58,340 --> 00:54:00,820
 - They've got an unbelievably good Normandy correspondent.

1644
00:54:00,820 --> 00:54:02,540
 (laughing)

1645
00:54:02,540 --> 00:54:03,820
 - Wait till I tell you why it is,

1646
00:54:03,820 --> 00:54:05,300
 because it's so unlikely.

1647
00:54:05,300 --> 00:54:07,100
 But also, what a weird thing to make up.

1648
00:54:07,100 --> 00:54:08,660
 They said that in Normandy,

1649
00:54:08,660 --> 00:54:12,860
 they had a pot which had been bubbling away

1650
00:54:12,860 --> 00:54:15,100
 for over 300 years.

1651
00:54:15,100 --> 00:54:16,740
 It was in a Cistercian abbey,

1652
00:54:16,740 --> 00:54:19,260
 and researchers went into this soup

1653
00:54:19,260 --> 00:54:20,900
 and like took some tests,

1654
00:54:20,900 --> 00:54:23,540
 and they said that there was still some ingredients

1655
00:54:23,540 --> 00:54:27,860
 in there that had been in the stew for 350 years.

1656
00:54:27,860 --> 00:54:29,100
 - What, James, what you're reading

1657
00:54:29,100 --> 00:54:30,980
 is the Indian equivalent of the daily experience.

1658
00:54:30,980 --> 00:54:32,820
 (laughing)

1659
00:54:32,820 --> 00:54:34,260
 - But it is like that thing, isn't it?

1660
00:54:34,260 --> 00:54:37,020
 Where if you, every glass of water you drink

1661
00:54:37,020 --> 00:54:38,300
 has been through a dinosaur.

1662
00:54:38,300 --> 00:54:39,300
 - Yeah, okay.

1663
00:54:39,300 --> 00:54:40,540
 - Or, and Hitler.

1664
00:54:40,540 --> 00:54:41,500
 - And Hitler, yeah.

1665
00:54:42,500 --> 00:54:46,060
 - Which is why I've stopped drinking water, actually.

1666
00:54:46,060 --> 00:54:47,660
 Yeah, is there a filter for that?

1667
00:54:47,660 --> 00:54:49,820
 (laughing)

1668
00:54:49,820 --> 00:54:50,820
 Fittler, it's cool.

1669
00:54:50,820 --> 00:54:52,860
 - It hasn't been through,

1670
00:54:52,860 --> 00:54:54,820
 I mean, Hitler didn't drink that much.

1671
00:54:54,820 --> 00:54:55,660
 I don't think every glass of water--

1672
00:54:55,660 --> 00:54:57,180
 - I think he was a T-Total.

1673
00:54:57,180 --> 00:54:59,100
 - Or is it, is that a thing that is enough?

1674
00:54:59,100 --> 00:55:00,460
 - There's enough molecules.

1675
00:55:00,460 --> 00:55:01,300
 - Yeah.

1676
00:55:01,300 --> 00:55:02,420
 - Sorry, sorry, I just remembered.

1677
00:55:02,420 --> 00:55:04,700
 It's not the whole glass of water.

1678
00:55:04,700 --> 00:55:06,140
 It's one molecule.

1679
00:55:06,140 --> 00:55:08,380
 (laughing)

1680
00:55:08,380 --> 00:55:10,960
 (upbeat music)

1681
00:55:11,160 --> 00:55:13,440
 (upbeat music)

1682
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:15,400
 - Okay, that's it, that is all of our facts.
