00:00:00,00:00:02,(upbeat music)
00:00:02,00:00:16,"- Hello, and welcome to another episode"
00:00:16,00:00:17,"of No Such Thing as a Fish,"
00:00:17,00:00:19,a weekly podcast coming to you
00:00:19,00:00:21,from the QI offices in Covent Garden.
00:00:21,00:00:23,My name is Dan Schreiber.
00:00:23,00:00:25,"I am sitting here with Andrew Hunter Murray,"
00:00:25,00:00:27,"Anna Tyshinski, and James Harkin."
00:00:27,00:00:29,"And once again, we have gathered"
00:00:29,00:00:31,around the microphones with our four favorite facts
00:00:31,00:00:32,"from the last seven days,"
00:00:32,00:00:36,"and in no particular order, here we go."
00:00:36,00:00:40,"Starting with fact number one, and that is Andy."
00:00:40,00:00:41,- My fact this week is that there was a job
00:00:41,00:00:45,"in the 19th century, which just involved looking at the sea"
00:00:45,00:00:48,and being able to tell when there were pilchards
00:00:48,00:00:49,under the surface.
00:00:49,00:00:50,(laughing)
00:00:50,00:00:50,- Amazing.
00:00:50,00:00:52,"So were they, they weren't sticking their head"
00:00:52,00:00:53,under the sea.
00:00:53,00:00:55,"- No, don't be crazy, James."
00:00:55,00:00:57,- Okay.
00:00:57,00:00:58,- Little bit of inside baseball.
00:00:58,00:00:59,- Dan told us before we started recording
00:00:59,00:01:01,that's what he thought the job was.
00:01:01,00:01:03,"- Yeah, and I told you before the recording specifically,"
00:01:03,00:01:05,"so it wouldn't get mentioned on the recording,"
00:01:05,00:01:06,and look at us now.
00:01:06,00:01:09,This is an amazing job.
00:01:09,00:01:12,And it's not like they're sitting like a lifeguard
00:01:12,00:01:13,on a boat looking down.
00:01:13,00:01:14,They're up on a hill.
00:01:14,00:01:15,- They are.
00:01:15,00:01:16,- They're not even in the sea.
00:01:16,00:01:17,- So I should say where this comes from.
00:01:17,00:01:20,"It comes from this brilliant blog called About 1816,"
00:01:20,00:01:22,"which is by an author called James Hobson,"
00:01:22,00:01:23,who's written loads of books about George and Britain.
00:01:23,00:01:25,"There's one about stage coaches,"
00:01:25,00:01:26,which I was reading recently.
00:01:26,00:01:28,And he also writes about Cornish-piltered culture
00:01:28,00:01:30,in the 18th century.
00:01:30,00:01:31,- An obvious crossover.
00:01:31,00:01:34,"- And well, there were these,"
00:01:34,00:01:36,it was this huge part of Cornwall's economy
00:01:36,00:01:38,in the 18th century was piltered fishing
00:01:38,00:01:41,because they were these fish that came to the coast
00:01:41,00:01:44,"by the million, millions and millions of them."
00:01:44,00:01:47,"This job was called being a hewer,"
00:01:47,00:01:49,"literally like hue and cry, you know, shouting."
00:01:49,00:01:51,And they would stand on the high points along the coast.
00:01:51,00:01:55,"And when they saw this moving patch of purpley,"
00:01:55,00:01:57,"oily color on the surface,"
00:01:57,00:02:00,"they knew that was the sign that there was the huge,"
00:02:00,00:02:00,"I was about to say flock,"
00:02:00,00:02:02,a shoal of pilchards underneath it.
00:02:02,00:02:04,And maybe there was some sea birds hanging around it as well.
00:02:04,00:02:06,And then they would blow a special trumpet
00:02:06,00:02:09,or they would wave their little flags
00:02:09,00:02:11,"and they would shout, go and get the pilchards"
00:02:11,00:02:12,to the fishermen.
00:02:12,00:02:13,And then the fishermen would go and.
00:02:13,00:02:15,"- No, they would, they would shout, hever."
00:02:15,00:02:16,- Trick.
00:02:16,00:02:17,"- Yeah, hever."
00:02:17,00:02:18,"- What does that mean, hever?"
00:02:18,00:02:20,- It's an old word meaning fish and carnage.
00:02:20,00:02:21,"- Ah, fish."
00:02:21,00:02:23,- But now you get hever cake
00:02:23,00:02:24,if you go to a Cornish bakery.
00:02:24,00:02:26,- But it's not fish cake.
00:02:26,00:02:30,It's just related to the cake that was baked
00:02:30,00:02:32,for these fishermen when they would leave for the day out.
00:02:32,00:02:33,"- Oh, okay, yeah."
00:02:33,00:02:34,"- And the trumpet thing, by the way,"
00:02:34,00:02:37,"hewing is an old word for trumpeting,"
00:02:37,00:02:39,according to the OED.
00:02:39,00:02:40,"- Apparently, yes."
00:02:40,00:02:42,"- And it's not, this is not like your regular trumpet."
00:02:42,00:02:43,This was a four foot trumpet.
00:02:43,00:02:44,- Was it?
00:02:44,00:02:45,"- Yes, huge."
00:02:45,00:02:46,- I know this.
00:02:46,00:02:48,- And they had these flags as well.
00:02:48,00:02:50,"So they would wave semaphore flags,"
00:02:50,00:02:54,"which had special meanings to communicate to the boats,"
00:02:54,00:02:57,like go over there or come this way a bit or whatever.
00:02:57,00:02:59,"- 'Cause then they directed the boats, didn't they?"
00:02:59,00:02:59,"- Yeah, exactly."
00:02:59,00:03:00,- Which they'd seen them.
00:03:00,00:03:02,"'Cause Wilkie Collins, obviously,"
00:03:02,00:03:03,"and I'm famous, Victorian author,"
00:03:03,00:03:04,but he also wrote a bunch of essays
00:03:04,00:03:06,and one of them was about these hewers.
00:03:06,00:03:09,And he described them as feverishly waving
00:03:09,00:03:10,"two cloth-covered bushes,"
00:03:10,00:03:14,acting the part of a maniac of the most dangerous character.
00:03:14,00:03:16,'Cause they're just standing on a cliffside.
00:03:16,00:03:18,"- Cloth-covered bushes, like before they had flags,"
00:03:18,00:03:21,they had to cover a bush in cloth.
00:03:21,00:03:22,It's weird.
00:03:22,00:03:23,"They could have just waved around the cloth,"
00:03:23,00:03:24,if you would think.
00:03:24,00:03:25,- Yeah.
00:03:25,00:03:26,"What would they, presumably,"
00:03:26,00:03:28,"if you had spotted, you've sounded your horn,"
00:03:28,00:03:31,"you've got your semaphore flag out, bush."
00:03:31,00:03:33,"Presumably, you've sounded the horn"
00:03:33,00:03:34,because you've seen pilchards.
00:03:34,00:03:35,Okay?
00:03:35,00:03:36,You've seen them over that way.
00:03:36,00:03:37,"- Otherwise, you're gonna lose your job as a killer."
00:03:37,00:03:38,"- You're gonna lose your job, exactly."
00:03:38,00:03:40,It's the main purpose of the job.
00:03:40,00:03:42,You've pointed your flag at the direction.
00:03:42,00:03:43,What semaphore needs to happen?
00:03:43,00:03:45,What are you trying to communicate with the semaphore?
00:03:45,00:03:48,- You're telling the boats where they are specifically.
00:03:48,00:03:51,"So you're saying go to the right, go to the left,"
00:03:51,00:03:52,"go out to sea, come closer."
00:03:52,00:03:53,- Okay.
00:03:53,00:03:54,"- Just drop your nets there, kind of thing."
00:03:54,00:03:55,- Yeah.
00:03:55,00:03:57,- It was probably less complex semaphore
00:03:57,00:04:00,and more just pointing a flag to the right or to the left.
00:04:00,00:04:01,- I'm pretty sure it was proper.
00:04:01,00:04:02,It was proper.
00:04:02,00:04:03,I've looked up the signals.
00:04:03,00:04:04,"Yeah, yeah, I've looked up the signals."
00:04:04,00:04:06,"So it wasn't just, you know, left for left."
00:04:06,00:04:07,- So what were they?
00:04:07,00:04:08,I take it back.
00:04:08,00:04:09,"- I mean, this is the worst possible medium"
00:04:09,00:04:11,to communicate what the semaphore signals were.
00:04:11,00:04:11,- You can explain.
00:04:11,00:04:12,- You know.
00:04:12,00:04:13,"But it's just like you said, James,"
00:04:13,00:04:15,"there will be go east or go right off,"
00:04:15,00:04:16,which means go straight out.
00:04:16,00:04:18,It doesn't mean go right.
00:04:18,00:04:20,And cast net.
00:04:20,00:04:21,"- Oh, yeah."
00:04:21,00:04:23,"- Also, they could get messages to ships."
00:04:23,00:04:25,So they could signal to a man on board a ship
00:04:25,00:04:27,that his wife had had a baby.
00:04:27,00:04:28,- Ah.
00:04:28,00:04:29,- Yeah.
00:04:29,00:04:30,- In semaphore language.
00:04:30,00:04:31,- I don't know what the semaphore for that was.
00:04:31,00:04:33,(laughing)
00:04:33,00:04:34,- That's so good.
00:04:34,00:04:35,- They're seriously oily.
00:04:35,00:04:37,I've never really understood when people talk about
00:04:37,00:04:39,"oily fish and the non-oily fish,"
00:04:39,00:04:42,and they're bang on about oily fish being really good for you.
00:04:42,00:04:44,"What really, what the difference was,"
00:04:44,00:04:45,but that's why they were prized.
00:04:45,00:04:46,"So in the 19th century,"
00:04:46,00:04:49,"they were prized for their oil for lamps, weren't they?"
00:04:49,00:04:49,- Yeah.
00:04:49,00:04:50,- And so that would just be sold
00:04:50,00:04:52,and that would fund the whole industry.
00:04:52,00:04:53,- Yeah.
00:04:53,00:04:55,- And you'd have these filtered palaces.
00:04:55,00:04:56,- Yes.
00:04:56,00:04:58,"- Where they put all the fish in a barrel,"
00:04:58,00:05:01,"put 6,000 fish in a huge hog-seed barrel."
00:05:01,00:05:04,And then I think you squeeze down on the fish
00:05:04,00:05:08,and all the oil comes out and drains off into the gutters.
00:05:08,00:05:10,And then that's barreled up separately.
00:05:10,00:05:11,"- Yeah, right."
00:05:11,00:05:12,"- And you burnt, you can use it for lamps and things like that."
00:05:12,00:05:14,"- Well, they used to just hand them out as well"
00:05:14,00:05:15,to anyone who was quite poor.
00:05:15,00:05:16,"So as the boats would come back in,"
00:05:16,00:05:19,there's reports that you would have locals standing
00:05:19,00:05:22,"in the water just waiting for it to come in and say,"
00:05:22,00:05:24,"""Can you please just give me Pilchards?"""
00:05:24,00:05:26,And the person who was on the ship would feel
00:05:26,00:05:29,it was honor-bound to give the Pilchards.
00:05:29,00:05:30,So they would just hand them out.
00:05:30,00:05:31,"And then at the palaces as well,"
00:05:31,00:05:33,there would be the poor waiting outside
00:05:33,00:05:34,and they would be waiting for fish
00:05:34,00:05:37,that had like broken backs or that were diseased
00:05:37,00:05:39,"or you know, the ones that were being shot."
00:05:39,00:05:42,- They must have derived from these 30 million Pilchards
00:05:42,00:05:43,with little x-ray machines.
00:05:43,00:05:45,See if they've broken their spine.
00:05:45,00:05:47,"- Well, this one's got a bit of a cuff."
00:05:47,00:05:48,- That's the paw.
00:05:48,00:05:50,- Cross the line.
00:05:50,00:05:52,- But the only thing kids used to go to the beaches
00:05:52,00:05:55,with plastic bags and kind of scoop them out of the water.
00:05:55,00:05:56,But it's not just today.
00:05:56,00:05:58,- Plastic bags?
00:05:58,00:05:59,- But not plastic.
00:05:59,00:06:00,(laughing)
00:06:00,00:06:03,"- Quite century and now, Cornwall is, you know,"
00:06:03,00:06:05,"quite behind the times in some aspects,"
00:06:05,00:06:06,"but in others, unbelievably advanced."
00:06:06,00:06:09,- It had the Tesco plastic bags early in the 1400s.
00:06:09,00:06:10,"- They had the oil to make it from, didn't they?"
00:06:10,00:06:11,'Cause it was a bloody Pilchard.
00:06:11,00:06:12,"- Yes, exactly."
00:06:12,00:06:16,"Sorry, not plastic bags, other bags, non-plastic bags."
00:06:16,00:06:19,"- But yeah, so it was back in the 1800s, it was massive."
00:06:19,00:06:22,"And in 1871, they were exporting"
00:06:22,00:06:25,"roughly 16,000 tons per year."
00:06:25,00:06:29,"Now, that declined massively in Cornwall,"
00:06:29,00:06:31,"massively, massively, to the point of the 90s"
00:06:31,00:06:35,where they were only landing about six tons in total.
00:06:35,00:06:38,"So from 16,000 to six tons, and that's the early 90s."
00:06:38,00:06:41,But then that all changed when a man called Nutty Nowhere
00:06:41,00:06:45,came along and he reinvigorated the whole thing
00:06:45,00:06:47,by rebranding the Pilchard.
00:06:47,00:06:48,- I've seen Nutty Nowhere.
00:06:48,00:06:51,I think he's making some strong claims.
00:06:51,00:06:52,- Huge claims.
00:06:52,00:06:54,"- Well, he's basically just a random fisherman."
00:06:54,00:06:56,Is he from the South Coast?
00:06:56,00:06:57,"- Yes, what's he climbing?"
00:06:57,00:06:59,- He's from Cadwyth?
00:06:59,00:07:00,"- Oh, he's from Cadwyth."
00:07:00,00:07:01,"Okay, yeah, I go to Cadwyth every year."
00:07:01,00:07:03,I probably met him down the pub.
00:07:03,00:07:05,And I don't know if he's a guy
00:07:05,00:07:06,who's reformed the whole industry.
00:07:06,00:07:08,"I mean, it's not like everyone's eating Pilchards"
00:07:08,00:07:08,"for every meal, right?"
00:07:08,00:07:10,"- No, but I mean, a lot of people,"
00:07:10,00:07:13,"when you read interviews, sort of claim that he called them"
00:07:13,00:07:15,"Cornish Sardines, that suddenly was like,"
00:07:15,00:07:17,"""Ooh, that sounds a bit posh."""
00:07:17,00:07:18,"- Well, someone called them that."
00:07:18,00:07:19,They have had a rebrand.
00:07:19,00:07:20,"- Yeah, exactly."
00:07:20,00:07:21,"It wasn't him, but it was in that."
00:07:21,00:07:23,"Well, actually, no, it was him."
00:07:23,00:07:23,- It wasn't him.
00:07:23,00:07:26,"It was a guy called Nick Howell, I believe, in the '90s,"
00:07:26,00:07:29,"who, yeah, realized that Pilchards had a bad reputation."
00:07:29,00:07:31,They're called Sardines on the continent.
00:07:31,00:07:33,"And so, yeah, they were called."
00:07:33,00:07:35,"And Pilchards are just adult Sardines,"
00:07:35,00:07:37,"what we call Sardines, Pilchards are like adult versions"
00:07:37,00:07:39,"of that, aren't they? - And they're all herring."
00:07:39,00:07:40,- And they're all types of herring.
00:07:40,00:07:42,- What was his connection then to Nutty Nowhere?
00:07:42,00:07:43,- 'Cause Nutty Nowhere was--
00:07:43,00:07:44,- I don't know who Nutty Nowhere is.
00:07:44,00:07:45,"- Oh, Nutty Nowhere's a guy called Martin Ellis,"
00:07:45,00:07:47,and he was basically the only--
00:07:47,00:07:48,(laughing)
00:07:48,00:07:50,- Why do you keep calling him Nutty Nowhere?
00:07:50,00:07:51,"- Well, that's what he calls himself."
00:07:51,00:07:52,It's his nickname.
00:07:52,00:07:54,And he kind of--
00:07:54,00:07:56,"- Yeah, he collected two of every nuts, didn't he?"
00:07:56,00:07:58,(laughing)
00:07:58,00:07:59,Saved them when there was a big flood.
00:07:59,00:08:00,- Exactly.
00:08:00,00:08:02,- Two peanuts.
00:08:02,00:08:04,"- Well, ironically, apparently, his ship sank,"
00:08:04,00:08:06,"so I don't think, that's the story."
00:08:06,00:08:07,Did you read this?
00:08:07,00:08:08,- No.
00:08:08,00:08:10,- He took in too much Pilchard.
00:08:10,00:08:12,"It's got too heavy, and his ship went down,"
00:08:12,00:08:14,"and it had to be rescued,"
00:08:14,00:08:16,and the helicopter had to come in to do it.
00:08:16,00:08:17,- The helicopter's rescuing a whole ship.
00:08:17,00:08:18,(laughing)
00:08:18,00:08:20,"- I think him and the Pilchards, possibly."
00:08:20,00:08:21,"- Oh, sir."
00:08:21,00:08:23,(laughing)
00:08:23,00:08:25,- Take the Pilchards first.
00:08:25,00:08:26,- But this one's gonna broken back.
00:08:26,00:08:27,I don't care.
00:08:27,00:08:29,- Women in Pilchards first.
00:08:29,00:08:32,(laughing)
00:08:32,00:08:36,"- Yeah, but the point is, I can't find any record"
00:08:36,00:08:39,of a helicopter picking up a Pilchard man called Nutty Nowhere.
00:08:39,00:08:41,So it's the story that's told to him.
00:08:41,00:08:43,- I think they do a lot of rescues out in Cornwall.
00:08:43,00:08:44,- But they log them as well.
00:08:44,00:08:46,There's a log rescues.
00:08:46,00:08:47,- You do have to log the rescues.
00:08:47,00:08:50,It's frowned on to just go around rescuing people
00:08:50,00:08:51,and they're not telling anyone.
00:08:51,00:08:52,"- Did you check Nutty Nowhere and his actual name,"
00:08:52,00:08:53,"Martin, whenever it is?"
00:08:53,00:08:54,"- Good point, I just did Nutty Nowhere."
00:08:54,00:08:56,I should go back and check Martin Ellis.
00:08:56,00:08:58,"- They wouldn't put it on the form, would they?"
00:08:58,00:09:00,"Like, person rescues."
00:09:00,00:09:01,- It was a massive list.
00:09:01,00:09:03,There was six tons of Pilchard that I had to get through
00:09:03,00:09:04,before his name came.
00:09:04,00:09:05,(laughing)
00:09:05,00:09:06,Every individual one.
00:09:06,00:09:07,- Every Pilchard.
00:09:07,00:09:09,"- I mean, actually, Billy, Sarah."
00:09:09,00:09:11,(laughing)
00:09:11,00:09:14,They are elsewhere.
00:09:14,00:09:16,It's not just Cornwall that has a monopoly on them.
00:09:16,00:09:19,"And I actually, when I was looking at my Pilchard can"
00:09:19,00:09:21,"and realized it came from South Africa,"
00:09:21,00:09:22,"I thought, ""I wonder how many there are?"""
00:09:22,00:09:24,And there are shed loads in South Africa
00:09:24,00:09:26,and they've turned it into a big tourist industry there.
00:09:26,00:09:29,"And the Sardine Harvest, the Pilchard Harvest,"
00:09:29,00:09:32,is so massive that sometimes they don't need nets
00:09:32,00:09:36,'cause the sea just dumps piles on the beach.
00:09:36,00:09:38,"- Oh, wow."
00:09:38,00:09:38,- The sea retreats.
00:09:38,00:09:41,"- Also, just like a tractor or a dump truck."
00:09:41,00:09:43,"- Exactly, scoop it up."
00:09:43,00:09:46,"And yeah, they've got sort of festival days"
00:09:46,00:09:48,where they invite tourists to come and take part
00:09:48,00:09:50,in various Sardine marches and stuff like that.
00:09:50,00:09:52,No one knows why they go there.
00:09:52,00:09:54,But it's kind of a mystery because the shores
00:09:54,00:09:56,of like Northern South Africa where they hang out
00:09:56,00:09:58,are not very appealing to Sardines.
00:09:58,00:10:01,- And do we know why they come to Cornwall?
00:10:01,00:10:04,"Are they mating, or are they feeding?"
00:10:04,00:10:05,"- Oh, we don't know."
00:10:05,00:10:07,I think it's for feeding.
00:10:07,00:10:08,I think they're coming.
00:10:08,00:10:09,Which way would they be coming?
00:10:09,00:10:11,I think it's for feeding.
00:10:11,00:10:13,"- But that African Sardine run that you mentioned, Anna,"
00:10:13,00:10:16,that might be the biggest biological movement on the planet
00:10:16,00:10:19,'cause there's also the East African wildebeest herds.
00:10:19,00:10:21,"Obviously, your individual wildebeest,"
00:10:21,00:10:23,lot bigger than your individual Pilchard.
00:10:23,00:10:26,But there are so many Pilchards
00:10:26,00:10:28,that they might outweigh all the wildebeest.
00:10:28,00:10:29,It's hard to tell.
00:10:29,00:10:30,"- It's one of those classic,"
00:10:30,00:10:32,would you rather fight one wildebeest
00:10:32,00:10:34,or a thousand Pilchards?
00:10:34,00:10:36,- It depends where you're fighting them.
00:10:36,00:10:37,"If you're in the sea,"
00:10:37,00:10:38,I'll take on the wildebeest.
00:10:38,00:10:40,(laughing)
00:10:40,00:10:41,- 'Cause they've challenged you.
00:10:41,00:10:44,You are the one who gets to choose the location.
00:10:44,00:10:46,I would choose actually a hot air balloon for either.
00:10:46,00:10:47,For either fight.
00:10:47,00:10:47,- That's clever.
00:10:47,00:10:49,- Playing it really safe.
00:10:49,00:10:50,Don't even back yourself against the Pilchards
00:10:50,00:10:51,on the desert.
00:10:51,00:10:53,(laughing)
00:10:53,00:10:54,- Why take the risk?
00:10:54,00:10:56,- They have a tendency of disappearing and reappearing.
00:10:56,00:10:58,So I think people keep blaming the decline
00:10:58,00:11:01,of Pilchard industry on like people's declining tastes.
00:11:01,00:11:03,But they just bugger off sometimes.
00:11:03,00:11:05,"This is the thing with oily fish,"
00:11:05,00:11:06,is why you can't depend on them.
00:11:06,00:11:08,'Cause they slip through your fingers.
00:11:08,00:11:10,"'Cause the reason they're,"
00:11:10,00:11:11,it's not 'cause of that.
00:11:11,00:11:13,The reason they're oily is 'cause they have to have loads
00:11:13,00:11:15,of fat in their body because they're the fish
00:11:15,00:11:18,that migrate huge distances in massive shoals.
00:11:18,00:11:20,So that's why you've got these oily fish.
00:11:20,00:11:21,"They're fish that pelagic,"
00:11:21,00:11:23,"that live in the middle part of the sea,"
00:11:23,00:11:24,"as opposed to all your white fish,"
00:11:24,00:11:25,which live at the bottom.
00:11:25,00:11:26,- Good word.
00:11:26,00:11:27,- Which I think very much.
00:11:27,00:11:29,I didn't make it up myself.
00:11:29,00:11:30,(laughing)
00:11:30,00:11:31,But thank you.
00:11:31,00:11:33,So these shoals sometimes migrate somewhere different.
00:11:33,00:11:36,"So in 1820, we say the industry was massive."
00:11:36,00:11:39,"In 1820, they all disappeared and went to Ireland."
00:11:39,00:11:41,And the Cornish were really furious.
00:11:41,00:11:44,"And there were articles written in the 1820s saying,"
00:11:44,00:11:45,"you know, this is a complete disaster."
00:11:45,00:11:47,The Irish don't like Pilchards.
00:11:47,00:11:49,"They're just flocking to Ireland and the Irish are saying,"
00:11:49,00:11:50,we think these are disgusting.
00:11:50,00:11:52,"- The Irish do have their own hewers though,"
00:11:52,00:11:54,and they have their special laws for their hewers.
00:11:54,00:11:57,- So I think it's got Pilchard fanciings gone up and down.
00:11:57,00:12:00,So they have sometimes had a big hewering tradition.
00:12:00,00:12:02,And then it just went out of fashion.
00:12:02,00:12:03,- Okay.
00:12:03,00:12:05,"There's a special law in Ireland that if you're a hewer,"
00:12:05,00:12:08,you're allowed to stand on any private property
00:12:08,00:12:09,to do your job.
00:12:09,00:12:09,- No way.
00:12:09,00:12:10,- What?
00:12:10,00:12:12,"- I mean, you can't go into the middle of Dublin."
00:12:12,00:12:15,Like just stand in someone's house.
00:12:15,00:12:17,- I need to come into your bedroom now.
00:12:17,00:12:18,(laughing)
00:12:18,00:12:21,- Presumably it's someone's property that's on the coast.
00:12:21,00:12:25,- I got reason to believe there are five million Pilchards
00:12:25,00:12:26,in this room.
00:12:26,00:12:27,Let me in.
00:12:27,00:12:30,Let me into this bank vault right now.
00:12:30,00:12:31,Help me with my trumpet.
00:12:32,00:12:37,"Can I just ask on the hewers that you said it was a job,"
00:12:37,00:12:40,"but they, I mean, the Pilchards just turn up"
00:12:40,00:12:42,"at one stage in the autumn, right?"
00:12:42,00:12:43,"So what do they do for the,"
00:12:43,00:12:45,"it's very seasonal this job, isn't it?"
00:12:45,00:12:46,- It is seasonal work.
00:12:46,00:12:48,You're absolutely right.
00:12:48,00:12:51,"I don't, I imagine they had a kind of portfolio career."
00:12:51,00:12:53,- They might be a trumpeter for the rest of the year.
00:12:53,00:12:54,"- Yeah, absolutely."
00:12:54,00:12:56,"Or a Bush, Semaphore instructor."
00:12:56,00:12:57,"I mean, there's all sorts of stuff they could do"
00:12:57,00:12:58,"with their skills, you know."
00:12:58,00:13:01,"But they had, yeah, they did get paid a guinea week"
00:13:01,00:13:02,during the good times.
00:13:02,00:13:04,"So maybe it was one of those jobs where,"
00:13:04,00:13:05,"much like a tourist season today actually,"
00:13:05,00:13:07,"you know, it's very big in the high seas."
00:13:07,00:13:09,"And then you just sort of, you know."
00:13:09,00:13:11,- Could be a signalman.
00:13:11,00:13:12,- Yes. - A woman.
00:13:12,00:13:13,"- Yeah, on the railways."
00:13:13,00:13:13,"On the railways, for example."
00:13:13,00:13:15,- On the railways. - At the airports.
00:13:15,00:13:16,"- At the airports, yep."
00:13:16,00:13:18,- Could be a plastic bag maker.
00:13:18,00:13:19,- Yeah.
00:13:19,00:13:22,(upbeat music)
00:13:22,00:13:27,"- Okay, it is time for fact number two."
00:13:27,00:13:28,And that is my fact.
00:13:28,00:13:31,My fact this week is that the sound designer
00:13:31,00:13:35,for the movie King Richard is called Richard King.
00:13:35,00:13:35,- So good.
00:13:35,00:13:36,"- Yeah, so good."
00:13:36,00:13:37,- So great.
00:13:37,00:13:38,"Did you just, did you just spot this?"
00:13:38,00:13:41,"- No, this was a buddy of mine, Ali Plum."
00:13:41,00:13:44,He's the BBC Radio One music reviewer and interviewer.
00:13:44,00:13:46,He spotted it and he told me about it.
00:13:46,00:13:49,"And yeah, Richard King is, you know,"
00:13:49,00:13:52,he's actually quite famous as you can imagine.
00:13:52,00:13:54,He's part of this big movie.
00:13:54,00:13:55,- He's won for Oscars.
00:13:55,00:13:56,- He's won for Oscars.
00:13:56,00:13:58,"And he's, you know, he's been the sound designer for movies"
00:13:58,00:14:00,"like The Latest Wonder Woman 1984,"
00:14:00,00:14:01,Tenet Dunkirk.
00:14:01,00:14:03,So he's very tied in with Christopher Nolan.
00:14:03,00:14:05,He did Interstellar with him.
00:14:05,00:14:07,- Do we know if Richard King only took the job
00:14:07,00:14:11,because he enjoyed the symmetry of the name?
00:14:11,00:14:13,"- Oh, I've got a good reason why he might."
00:14:13,00:14:15,Tenet is all about things being backwards
00:14:15,00:14:16,as well as forwards.
00:14:16,00:14:17,- Palindromic.
00:14:17,00:14:18,"- King Richard, Richard King."
00:14:18,00:14:20,"That's, it explains why he took the job"
00:14:20,00:14:22,as well as him being a massively respected sound engineer
00:14:22,00:14:24,and him needing the work.
00:14:24,00:14:27,"But for Tenet, this is one specific thing."
00:14:27,00:14:29,So I haven't seen Tenet.
00:14:29,00:14:32,"It sounds, so some things happen backwards"
00:14:32,00:14:34,even though the world is happening forwards.
00:14:34,00:14:36,"- Yeah, you kind of got two parallel things"
00:14:36,00:14:38,that happen in one goes forward and one goes backwards.
00:14:38,00:14:39,- Why haven't I watched it?
00:14:39,00:14:41,But they had to make reverse gunshots.
00:14:41,00:14:44,So they tried playing all the sound effects they had.
00:14:44,00:14:46,"You know, they have a sound effect of a gun,"
00:14:46,00:14:48,which is a bang.
00:14:48,00:14:49,And then.
00:14:49,00:14:51,- Why didn't they just use you for that?
00:14:51,00:14:53,(laughing)
00:14:53,00:14:54,"- But it's, but it sounded rubbish."
00:14:54,00:14:55,It sounded cheap and stupid
00:14:55,00:14:57,when they just played the sounds backwards.
00:14:57,00:15:00,"So they had to generate new sounds of what, you know,"
00:15:00,00:15:02,"playing, taking off might sound like backwards,"
00:15:02,00:15:03,"but forwards. - Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:15:03,00:15:04,Interesting. - It's so weird.
00:15:04,00:15:06,- 'Cause they could have just taken the original one
00:15:06,00:15:08,"and made it go backwards, right?"
00:15:08,00:15:09,"'Cause they have that technology,"
00:15:09,00:15:11,but it doesn't quite sound right.
00:15:11,00:15:14,- They have the technology to make sound rewind.
00:15:14,00:15:15,You're kidding. - It's amazing.
00:15:15,00:15:17,- I haven't been able to share this with the rest of us.
00:15:17,00:15:18,"- 20 years ago, they had that."
00:15:18,00:15:21,But the thing is that King Richard is about tennis
00:15:21,00:15:22,and that movie is Tenet.
00:15:22,00:15:25,So maybe he's just looking his way through the fix.
00:15:25,00:15:27,- He's definitely got a word thing.
00:15:27,00:15:29,He's the Susie Dent of the sound engineer world.
00:15:29,00:15:30,- Sounds like.
00:15:30,00:15:31,- I don't know.
00:15:31,00:15:32,I wonder if this movie does
00:15:32,00:15:35,because they had a carpenter called James Crane.
00:15:35,00:15:36,"Carpenter's might use cranes,"
00:15:36,00:15:37,"might, and they--"
00:15:37,00:15:38,- Why?
00:15:38,00:15:39,I thought it was a carpeting emergency frame
00:15:39,00:15:40,"for me to look like, oh yeah."
00:15:40,00:15:42,"- Okay, look, this is--"
00:15:42,00:15:44,- The viewer was stuck somewhere in Ireland.
00:15:44,00:15:46,- This is the one I'm opening with.
00:15:46,00:15:46,(laughing)
00:15:46,00:15:50,"They had an ellen safety manager called Guinevere Aid,"
00:15:50,00:15:51,like first aid.
00:15:51,00:15:52,"- Yeah, that's good."
00:15:52,00:15:53,"- I think that's good, yeah."
00:15:53,00:15:58,The tennis racket stringer was called Jeffrey Ibatuon.
00:15:58,00:15:59,- That's not true.
00:15:59,00:15:59,- Ibatuon.
00:15:59,00:16:00,- Ibatuon.
00:16:00,00:16:01,- How are you spelling it?
00:16:01,00:16:02,How much of your words for pronunciation?
00:16:02,00:16:04,"- No, no, I-B-A-T-U-A-N."
00:16:04,00:16:05,Ibatuon.
00:16:05,00:16:06,"- Oh, wow."
00:16:06,00:16:08,"- Okay, that's extremely good."
00:16:08,00:16:10,I would definitely have opened with Ibatuon
00:16:10,00:16:12,"rather than James Crane, the carpenter."
00:16:12,00:16:13,(laughing)
00:16:13,00:16:15,"If he'd been called James Plane,"
00:16:15,00:16:17,I'd have been absolutely on board.
00:16:17,00:16:19,"- I'll be honest, like I was working on"
00:16:19,00:16:22,just basically all the people who worked on this show
00:16:22,00:16:24,on IMDB and it was Slim Pickings.
00:16:24,00:16:25,(laughing)
00:16:25,00:16:26,- It was Slim Pickings on it.
00:16:26,00:16:27,(laughing)
00:16:27,00:16:28,I love him.
00:16:28,00:16:32,"So sound design has a nickname,"
00:16:32,00:16:35,"which is used within the industry, which is called Foley."
00:16:35,00:16:36,So you're a Foley artist.
00:16:36,00:16:38,Foley sounds within movies.
00:16:38,00:16:40,It's really amazing.
00:16:40,00:16:42,"And particularly if you read interviews with Richard King,"
00:16:42,00:16:45,he can make something that is quite a boring sound.
00:16:45,00:16:46,"Some of these seem like, wow,"
00:16:46,00:16:48,what a day that must have been of picking the sound
00:16:48,00:16:51,for this tiny thing that I would never think about.
00:16:51,00:16:55,"If you're in a room and a door needs to be opened, right?"
00:16:55,00:16:57,"You would think, okay, there's probably just this bank"
00:16:57,00:16:59,of sound where it's just door opens.
00:16:59,00:17:02,"And he talks about it saying, no, the variety is endless."
00:17:02,00:17:05,You have doors that are opened because maybe they're open
00:17:05,00:17:07,because there's a baby sleeping in the room.
00:17:07,00:17:08,So it's a soft opening.
00:17:08,00:17:10,"So he's like, you don't only have just the creaks"
00:17:10,00:17:13,"of a door speed opening, you have emotional content"
00:17:13,00:17:14,to the opening of the door.
00:17:14,00:17:16,"And he's like, so I have like, you know,"
00:17:16,00:17:18,he's got thousands of doors that he's collected.
00:17:18,00:17:20,"- The door, the happy door, the furious door."
00:17:20,00:17:24,"- Drunk door, Terminator 2 I was reading about."
00:17:24,00:17:26,"The opening scene of Terminator 2,"
00:17:26,00:17:29,there's a sort of exoskeleton terminator walking
00:17:29,00:17:33,in a apocalypse over all these skulls and stuff.
00:17:33,00:17:35,"So the ambient sound that you hear in that scene,"
00:17:35,00:17:36,"if you watch that scene next time,"
00:17:36,00:17:39,is you've got someone having put a microphone
00:17:39,00:17:40,just next to the crack in the door
00:17:40,00:17:44,at George Lucas' Skywalker Ranch
00:17:44,00:17:46,and just getting the ambience of the outside.
00:17:46,00:17:49,"And that's mixed with someone going, whoosh,"
00:17:49,00:17:51,"with their mouth, whoosh."
00:17:51,00:17:52,So that's what you're hearing in the background.
00:17:52,00:17:55,And then when this exoskeleton is standing
00:17:55,00:17:57,"on all of these human skulls,"
00:17:57,00:17:59,that's pistachio nuts being crushed.
00:17:59,00:18:01,So those are the elements that you see in that scene.
00:18:01,00:18:04,And just how they get to thinking a pistachio nut
00:18:04,00:18:07,can be a better sound than a real skull being crushed.
00:18:07,00:18:08,(laughing)
00:18:08,00:18:11,"- Sometimes easy to access pistachio nut shells,"
00:18:11,00:18:13,"down natural skulls, isn't it, in different places?"
00:18:13,00:18:15,"- If you get a pistachio nut, you know how they're like"
00:18:15,00:18:17,"slightly open on one end,"
00:18:17,00:18:20,"if you just squeeze the slightly open end,"
00:18:20,00:18:23,then the lever mechanism will open the other end
00:18:23,00:18:25,and you can just pull the top shell off
00:18:25,00:18:28,and then just get to the inside without kind of pressure.
00:18:28,00:18:29,- Are you sure that actually works?
00:18:29,00:18:30,"- Yeah, I do. - Does it?"
00:18:30,00:18:31,- Yeah. - Really?
00:18:31,00:18:32,- You would have been fired by Richard King
00:18:32,00:18:35,immediately when you handed in your sound effects.
00:18:35,00:18:37,"- What the fuck is this, James?"
00:18:37,00:18:39,"- What I'm just thinking is,"
00:18:39,00:18:41,"when you watch actual tennis, right,"
00:18:41,00:18:44,someone does a serve and you hear the noise
00:18:44,00:18:46,"of the serve and it's quite,"
00:18:46,00:18:49,"you know, you would know that noise if you heard it, right?"
00:18:49,00:18:53,"But I remember reading that sometimes in sports, on TV,"
00:18:53,00:18:55,"they add the sounds in later, right?"
00:18:55,00:18:56,"I don't know if this is true,"
00:18:56,00:19:01,"but I remember reading that when a dart hits a dartboard,"
00:19:01,00:19:03,"if you imagine yourself playing darts,"
00:19:03,00:19:05,"they don't make that ""foof"" when it hits it, right?"
00:19:05,00:19:06,But then some people do that.
00:19:06,00:19:10,"And I remember reading that in horse racing,"
00:19:10,00:19:12,"there's no microphones on the far side,"
00:19:12,00:19:14,so there's no way you could make that sound.
00:19:14,00:19:16,"So I thought that they use ""Wilder Beast."""
00:19:16,00:19:18,- They do. - That's crazy.
00:19:18,00:19:19,"- They absolutely, they play that in."
00:19:19,00:19:22,"- It's the sound of a stampeding ""Wilder Beast."""
00:19:22,00:19:24,"And they play it, they don't play it for the audience"
00:19:24,00:19:26,"in the, you know. - No, obviously live."
00:19:26,00:19:27,"- On TV. - They play it over TV, yeah."
00:19:27,00:19:28,So this is insane.
00:19:28,00:19:31,"I was reading about a guy called Dennis Baxter,"
00:19:31,00:19:34,who was the sound designer for the Olympics in 2012.
00:19:34,00:19:36,"And in fact, multiple Olympic games."
00:19:36,00:19:38,"And this is exactly the problem, James,"
00:19:38,00:19:40,"because loads of places,"
00:19:40,00:19:42,they don't have microphones for the whole thing.
00:19:42,00:19:44,"But they have to add microphones wherever they can,"
00:19:44,00:19:45,and then sometimes cheat a bit.
00:19:45,00:19:47,"So for the balance beams,"
00:19:47,00:19:49,they would put microphones on the beam.
00:19:49,00:19:52,So no audience would ever hear the creaking
00:19:52,00:19:53,"and the movement of the beam. - Yeah, yeah."
00:19:53,00:19:54,- But you do on TV.
00:19:54,00:19:55,"And then for the archery,"
00:19:55,00:19:57,they had a microphone on the target.
00:19:57,00:19:59,They had a microphone next to the archer for the launch.
00:19:59,00:20:02,And they also put one in between
00:20:02,00:20:04,on the arrow's path to capture the swoosh.
00:20:04,00:20:07,"- Oh, so that's why they're catching the actual sound there."
00:20:07,00:20:08,"They're not, 'cause for me,"
00:20:08,00:20:10,I would probably get like a ruler
00:20:10,00:20:13,on the side of a table and then twang it.
00:20:13,00:20:15,(all laughing)
00:20:15,00:20:16,- That's genius. - Yeah.
00:20:16,00:20:18,"But you're right, they fake it sometimes."
00:20:18,00:20:21,"So Dennis Baxter, he did the boat race for a while."
00:20:21,00:20:22,"- Oh, was this in an interview with him?"
00:20:22,00:20:24,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah, I've heard this, amazing."
00:20:24,00:20:27,"- The boat race, if you're actually in the boats"
00:20:27,00:20:28,"or on the bank, what it sounds like"
00:20:28,00:20:30,is the engines of the support boats
00:20:30,00:20:31,and the helicopters flying overhead.
00:20:31,00:20:33,"And if you play that on TV,"
00:20:33,00:20:35,it would be an incredibly weird experience.
00:20:35,00:20:36,So he went out before the boat race.
00:20:36,00:20:39,He recorded clean swishing rowing sounds.
00:20:39,00:20:41,And that's what you're hearing.
00:20:41,00:20:42,You're hearing Dennis Baxter rowing
00:20:42,00:20:44,"or someone being recorded live. - Well, he cheated."
00:20:44,00:20:45,"That's amazing. - Yeah, yeah."
00:20:45,00:20:46,- How cool is that?
00:20:46,00:20:47,- And it is the tennis as well.
00:20:47,00:20:49,It's a really precise job working out
00:20:49,00:20:53,when to up the volume of the ball hitting sound
00:20:53,00:20:54,and when to decrease it.
00:20:54,00:20:55,And it depends completely on the tension
00:20:55,00:20:57,and also the crowd sound.
00:20:57,00:20:59,And I think he does ground sounds as well.
00:20:59,00:21:02,"And yeah, he talks about you have to sense"
00:21:02,00:21:05,how tense a moment it is and then reduce the crowd sound
00:21:05,00:21:07,or sense that everyone's getting really excited
00:21:07,00:21:09,and then you bring up the crowd sound
00:21:09,00:21:11,and then you make the sound of the tennis ball
00:21:11,00:21:13,"hitting the ground a bit less, the crowd a bit higher."
00:21:13,00:21:15,- Is there someone doing the moaning as well?
00:21:15,00:21:16,(laughing)
00:21:16,00:21:17,- That's his wife actually.
00:21:17,00:21:20,(laughing)
00:21:20,00:21:24,- I was reading about Foley
00:21:24,00:21:27,and there was actually a film made about Foley art itself
00:21:27,00:21:30,and it's called Burberry and Sound Studio.
00:21:30,00:21:32,It was a horror film that was made in about 2012.
00:21:32,00:21:34,It had some famous actors in it.
00:21:34,00:21:35,It was meant to be okay.
00:21:35,00:21:37,"Anyway, it was partly about Foley art."
00:21:37,00:21:40,So the main character is working in a movie studio
00:21:40,00:21:41,and he's coming up with sound effects.
00:21:41,00:21:44,"And in this film, he has to come up with the sound effects"
00:21:44,00:21:46,for these really gory horror scenes.
00:21:46,00:21:47,And he has to come up with these sound effects
00:21:47,00:21:51,"by smashing up pieces of fruit, the classic."
00:21:51,00:21:52,"So he's shown in this film,"
00:21:52,00:21:55,smashing up watermelons or mangoes or whatever it takes.
00:21:55,00:21:57,But they realized when making this film
00:21:57,00:21:59,"that the sound of fruit smashing up,"
00:21:59,00:22:02,it does not actually sound enough
00:22:02,00:22:04,like the sound of fruit smashing up.
00:22:04,00:22:05,- So they had to find some skulls
00:22:05,00:22:08,"and break them in, didn't they?"
00:22:08,00:22:10,"- They couldn't get the skulls,"
00:22:10,00:22:12,but the sound of the fruit smashing up is made
00:22:12,00:22:16,with pieces of wet cloth and bits of wood being bashed around.
00:22:16,00:22:17,- That's amazing.
00:22:17,00:22:18,- That's so funny.
00:22:18,00:22:20,- How better is that?
00:22:20,00:22:24,- We keep saying Jack Foley was a real person as well.
00:22:24,00:22:25,This was the person who created the idea
00:22:25,00:22:28,that you could overdub within the sort of
00:22:28,00:22:31,"behind the scenes of the movie, the post-production."
00:22:31,00:22:34,And his first job when he did it was he was working
00:22:34,00:22:37,on a movie which was showboat.
00:22:37,00:22:40,"And his first, I think one of his first things"
00:22:40,00:22:43,that he did for it was he walked as three people.
00:22:43,00:22:46,So he had a cane and he had his own footsteps
00:22:46,00:22:48,and he managed to match the footsteps
00:22:48,00:22:51,of three people walking using both just his feet and a cane.
00:22:51,00:22:53,"And that was the moment when they went, oh my God,"
00:22:53,00:22:55,"this is, what is this?"
00:22:55,00:22:56,And he started experimenting more of it.
00:22:56,00:22:58,- Was it three one-legged people?
00:22:58,00:23:01,"- No, I guess you can move your feet quite fast"
00:23:01,00:23:04,"to be in time with all of the feet, can't you?"
00:23:04,00:23:06,- So did he get people to close their eyes
00:23:06,00:23:09,and say three people are gonna come in and out of this room
00:23:09,00:23:14,and then did the three gates and then said it was all me?
00:23:14,00:23:16,"- Oh, I see."
00:23:16,00:23:17,"No, I think he just showed them the product"
00:23:17,00:23:19,"of the recording, matched with the film."
00:23:19,00:23:23,"- He could have been an incredible master criminal, you know."
00:23:23,00:23:25,"- Make it look like a burglary was five people,"
00:23:25,00:23:26,but actually it was one.
00:23:26,00:23:29,"- Make it sound like a burglary was five people, you know?"
00:23:29,00:23:30,- That's true.
00:23:30,00:23:32,- He's no good with an eyewitness.
00:23:32,00:23:34,"- No, he could only operate under conditions"
00:23:34,00:23:37,of pitch black darkness.
00:23:37,00:23:40,"But they would, you know, afterwards the security guard"
00:23:40,00:23:41,who'd been blindfolded.
00:23:41,00:23:42,- He could rob spec savers.
00:23:42,00:23:44,- Exactly.
00:23:44,00:23:46,"Again, everyone would have to be blindfolded"
00:23:46,00:23:47,and in the area as well.
00:23:47,00:23:49,"But then they would say afterwards, oh yeah,"
00:23:49,00:23:52,15 large-
00:23:52,00:23:53,- Will the Beast.
00:23:53,00:23:54,- Will the Beast came in to the shop
00:23:54,00:23:55,and took all the glasses.
00:23:55,00:23:58,"- Or herring, we're not sure which."
00:23:58,00:23:59,- But he could do them so accurately
00:23:59,00:24:01,and then 'cause they'd never look for Jack Foley.
00:24:01,00:24:05,- So he died when he was 76 years old
00:24:05,00:24:07,and he reckoned he had a long career in movies.
00:24:07,00:24:08,"- Well, or did he?"
00:24:08,00:24:10,Did he just make it sound like he died
00:24:10,00:24:12,to continue his crime spree?
00:24:12,00:24:13,"- Good call, yeah."
00:24:13,00:24:15,"That's a cold case, we don't know."
00:24:15,00:24:18,"But he reckoned he did 5,000 miles of walking"
00:24:18,00:24:21,in the time of his career for films.
00:24:21,00:24:23,"He doesn't say whether or not that was like,"
00:24:23,00:24:25,I was walking to buy some pistachios
00:24:25,00:24:27,or I assume it's the footsteps
00:24:27,00:24:28,that have appeared on our screens.
00:24:28,00:24:31,"- Yeah, I would assume so, I don't know."
00:24:31,00:24:34,- But also his voice was on movies.
00:24:34,00:24:37,"He is responsible for the first ever, we believe,"
00:24:37,00:24:41,"Tarzan Cole, the very first, yeah,"
00:24:41,00:24:43,Tarzan the Tiger in 1929 was the first movie
00:24:43,00:24:44,and it wasn't that though.
00:24:44,00:24:45,- Was it not?
00:24:45,00:24:48,"- No, it was just him going, ee-ah!"
00:24:48,00:24:51,And that was supposedly Jack Foley.
00:24:51,00:24:53,It's sort of a bit lost whether or not it was him
00:24:53,00:24:55,because I think the footage itself has been lost.
00:24:55,00:24:56,It's one of those lost films.
00:24:56,00:24:59,"Cole, the one that we know that goes, ee-ah!"
00:24:59,00:25:01,"It's like a palindrome, isn't it?"
00:25:01,00:25:03,That's the fun facts about that.
00:25:03,00:25:04,- And it's trademarked.
00:25:04,00:25:07,It's owned by the Edgar Rice Burrows family
00:25:07,00:25:10,"and they've got the exact, it's like nine calls"
00:25:10,00:25:11,"or 10 calls, isn't it?"
00:25:11,00:25:12,And it's an exhale in it.
00:25:12,00:25:13,"- Well, after Tenet and Tennis,"
00:25:13,00:25:16,"Richard King can do Tarzan next, yeah."
00:25:16,00:25:18,- The film just about the Tarzan Cole.
00:25:18,00:25:20,"How would you, what would the title of that film be?"
00:25:20,00:25:22,- If it was just about the Cole.
00:25:22,00:25:25,(all laughing)
00:25:25,00:25:27,- I was just wondering how you'd spell the film name.
00:25:27,00:25:29,(all laughing)
00:25:29,00:25:30,Just goes away.
00:25:30,00:25:33,"- R-E-R-E-R-E-R, I think."
00:25:33,00:25:35,(all laughing)
00:25:35,00:25:36,- You'd think it was a hospital drama.
00:25:36,00:25:37,"- Right, right, right, right."
00:25:37,00:25:41,(all laughing)
00:25:41,00:25:43,- Should we talk about the William sisters?
00:25:43,00:25:44,- Yeah.
00:25:44,00:25:47,"- So this movie, King Richard,"
00:25:47,00:25:49,the King Richard in the title is the father
00:25:49,00:25:51,of Venus and Serena Williams.
00:25:51,00:25:54,"And he, I don't think it gives anything away"
00:25:54,00:25:57,for the movie to say he was a very hot housing father
00:25:57,00:26:02,who really wanted his children to be tennis players
00:26:02,00:26:03,"at a very, very young age."
00:26:03,00:26:05,"He'd never had any training,"
00:26:05,00:26:08,but he taught them how to become great tennis players
00:26:08,00:26:10,and they were the greatest of all time.
00:26:10,00:26:13,I read an interview with Venus from 1991.
00:26:13,00:26:15,This was in Sports Illustrated.
00:26:15,00:26:18,And even then she knew she wanted to be a tennis player.
00:26:18,00:26:19,She was a brilliant tennis player.
00:26:19,00:26:21,"They said, ""What would you like to be when you grow up?"""
00:26:21,00:26:23,"She's like, ""I want to be a tennis player."""
00:26:23,00:26:27,Or an archeologist or an astronaut who travels to Jupiter.
00:26:27,00:26:28,- Cool.
00:26:28,00:26:29,- Wow.
00:26:29,00:26:32,- That was her three possible things she wanted to be.
00:26:32,00:26:33,"And I looked it up 'cause I wondered,"
00:26:33,00:26:36,"and this is true, both Venus and Serena"
00:26:36,00:26:40,"have now owned properties in the town of Jupiter, Florida."
00:26:40,00:26:41,- No.
00:26:41,00:26:42,"- So they kind of went,"
00:26:42,00:26:43,"'cause a lot of sports people live in Jupiter,"
00:26:43,00:26:45,"so, and they, yeah."
00:26:45,00:26:45,- Very nice.
00:26:45,00:26:46,- That's great.
00:26:46,00:26:47,- Isn't that the Jupiter she meant
00:26:47,00:26:49,"when she was five years old, is it?"
00:26:49,00:26:50,(all laughing)
00:26:50,00:26:51,"Just happens to be an astronaut,"
00:26:51,00:26:52,but living in a tennis place.
00:26:52,00:26:53,- That's amazing.
00:26:53,00:26:56,"- Venus Williams, one of the two Williams sisters."
00:26:56,00:26:57,- That's right.
00:26:57,00:26:59,- Owns a quarter of a dolphin.
00:26:59,00:27:00,(all laughing)
00:27:00,00:27:01,- A Miami dolphin?
00:27:01,00:27:03,"- A Miami dolphin, the American football team."
00:27:03,00:27:06,"She has a stake in the Miami dolphins,"
00:27:06,00:27:07,and it's quite a small stake.
00:27:07,00:27:08,- With Serena?
00:27:08,00:27:11,"- Yeah, but I think, so it's about,"
00:27:11,00:27:14,it's less than 1% that they own or that she owns.
00:27:14,00:27:17,"But anyway, if you include all the spare players"
00:27:17,00:27:18,"they would have, it would work out"
00:27:18,00:27:20,at one quarter of one dolphin.
00:27:20,00:27:21,- Amazing.
00:27:21,00:27:22,- Wow.
00:27:22,00:27:23,(all laughing)
00:27:23,00:27:25,"- Wait, and it's both of them that own it then, is it?"
00:27:25,00:27:26,- It's quite hard to find the exact chapter of verse
00:27:26,00:27:28,on how much they own or whether they own it together.
00:27:28,00:27:29,- You can understand why that hasn't been
00:27:29,00:27:31,"too extensively reported on, I guess,"
00:27:31,00:27:34,with all the stuff out there about the Williams sisters.
00:27:34,00:27:35,(all laughing)
00:27:35,00:27:38,"In 1995, Serena was 14,"
00:27:38,00:27:41,"and she wanted to go pro,"
00:27:41,00:27:43,and she was too young by the rules.
00:27:43,00:27:45,"And so she filed a lawsuit,"
00:27:45,00:27:49,"an antitrust lawsuit against the WTA, I think."
00:27:49,00:27:50,- Really?
00:27:50,00:27:51,- Saying I should be able to play.
00:27:51,00:27:54,"And actually, their dad had a bit of a vault vass"
00:27:54,00:27:56,in their early teens because he suddenly realized
00:27:56,00:27:58,that tennis can really screw you up.
00:27:58,00:28:00,"And the junior tennis circuit,"
00:28:00,00:28:02,all the parents were just awful.
00:28:02,00:28:04,There was a little bit of racism around.
00:28:04,00:28:06,"And he actually said to, I think Venus,"
00:28:06,00:28:07,I don't think you should become a tennis player.
00:28:07,00:28:08,"But she must have thought, well, thanks a lot, dad."
00:28:08,00:28:09,(all laughing)
00:28:09,00:28:11,I don't think even nothing else for 12 years.
00:28:11,00:28:13,(all laughing)
00:28:13,00:28:15,"But yeah, Serena tries to do this lawsuit"
00:28:15,00:28:16,"to say that you have to let me in, even though I'm 14."
00:28:16,00:28:18,- So that was Serena was it?
00:28:18,00:28:19,"- Sorry, Serena did this lawsuit thing."
00:28:19,00:28:24,"- So at that stage, Venus will have already become pro, right?"
00:28:24,00:28:26,"So maybe that was the reason, because yeah, in the movie,"
00:28:26,00:28:30,a lot of it is about how he doesn't want them to become pros.
00:28:30,00:28:31,"He doesn't, he don't want them to play any matches"
00:28:31,00:28:33,"until they become professional, really."
00:28:33,00:28:35,They play when they're like 10 years old
00:28:35,00:28:37,and then they don't play again until they're professional.
00:28:37,00:28:38,"- Except they play with him, don't they?"
00:28:38,00:28:39,"- Well, they were a lot of practice."
00:28:39,00:28:40,"- Practice, yeah."
00:28:40,00:28:42,(all laughing)
00:28:42,00:28:44,- They never touched a rocket again.
00:28:44,00:28:46,- But how do you go pro without going up a system
00:28:46,00:28:47,to get to the pro?
00:28:47,00:28:49,"- Well, they were so good."
00:28:49,00:28:53,"They basically had a pro, they had a trainer"
00:28:53,00:28:54,"and they were really, really good."
00:28:54,00:28:56,"And there was one game,"
00:28:56,00:28:57,"one of her first ever games, Venus,"
00:28:57,00:28:59,"she lost against the Rancho Sanchez Vicario,"
00:28:59,00:29:01,and this is part of the movie.
00:29:01,00:29:04,And they kind of slightly changed what happened in the movie.
00:29:04,00:29:06,"But anyway, she lost this game"
00:29:06,00:29:08,"and then they interviewed her afterwards and said,"
00:29:08,00:29:10,"""Well, you know, how is this loss"
00:29:10,00:29:12,against one of the best players in the world?
00:29:12,00:29:13,How's it compared to the other times
00:29:13,00:29:14,"when you've lost in other games?"""
00:29:14,00:29:16,"And she went, ""Well, I've never lost before."""
00:29:16,00:29:18,(all laughing)
00:29:18,00:29:21,She'd never lost a match in any of her junior things.
00:29:21,00:29:23,And then she stopped playing and then she became pro.
00:29:23,00:29:25,"And so, yeah, she'd never ever lost a match"
00:29:25,00:29:26,before at that stage.
00:29:26,00:29:27,- Amazing.
00:29:27,00:29:29,"Yeah, so Richard, the dad,"
00:29:29,00:29:32,he basically decided that he was gonna turn his two girls.
00:29:32,00:29:33,And he had a family before.
00:29:33,00:29:34,This was his second marriage
00:29:34,00:29:37,and two new kids to the family.
00:29:37,00:29:39,He was watching TV and he saw that a tennis player
00:29:39,00:29:40,"could earn $40,000 a week."
00:29:40,00:29:42,"And he thought, ""My God, that sounds amazing."
00:29:42,00:29:44,"I'm gonna train my girls up to do that."""
00:29:44,00:29:46,And he wrote up the 78-page training manual
00:29:46,00:29:49,for Serena and Venus that he had everything
00:29:49,00:29:52,that he'd learned in there and how he needed them to be.
00:29:52,00:29:54,He did a really interesting thing.
00:29:54,00:29:56,"And I say interesting, it's terrible."
00:29:56,00:29:59,He had his kids play Venus and Serena out in the public
00:29:59,00:30:03,"and he would pay local kids to come and jeer at them,"
00:30:03,00:30:04,to yell at them as they were playing
00:30:04,00:30:06,so that they could get used to the idea of crowds
00:30:06,00:30:09,being against them and having to push through it.
00:30:09,00:30:12,So there are people out there right now
00:30:12,00:30:15,"who have an anecdote, which is I was paid as a child"
00:30:15,00:30:17,to jeer at Serena.
00:30:17,00:30:22,I think my family might have been doing that at fish gigs.
00:30:22,00:30:24,- What kind of prodigy were they attempting
00:30:24,00:30:26,to turn you into and where did it go wrong?
00:30:26,00:30:36,"- Okay, it is time for fact number three and that is James."
00:30:36,00:30:39,"- Okay, my fact this week is that there is a tree in Pakistan"
00:30:39,00:30:43,that has been under arrest for more than 120 years.
00:30:44,00:30:46,- And still no charges brought?
00:30:46,00:30:50,"- No, that's Tony Blair levels of, you know,"
00:30:50,00:30:51,what's it called?
00:30:51,00:30:53,The thing that Tony Blair did with habeas corpus suspension.
00:30:53,00:30:55,- That is such an obscure reference
00:30:55,00:30:58,to Blair era home office policy.
00:30:58,00:30:59,"- Guys, we all remember it."
00:30:59,00:31:00,"- Oh, sorry."
00:31:00,00:31:01,- And they're all still outraged.
00:31:01,00:31:02,"- Yep, sorry."
00:31:02,00:31:07,"- Anyway, yes, apparently no habeas corpus"
00:31:07,00:31:09,when it comes to trees in Pakistan.
00:31:09,00:31:12,"This is, well, is this true?"
00:31:12,00:31:14,"I mean, there is a tree."
00:31:14,00:31:18,There's a tree in Pakistan that is undoubtedly true.
00:31:18,00:31:20,It's a Banyan tree.
00:31:20,00:31:23,It's undoubtedly true that the tree is chained up.
00:31:23,00:31:25,And it's undoubtedly true that there is a board
00:31:25,00:31:28,on the tree that says I am under arrest.
00:31:28,00:31:30,One evening a British officer heavily drunk
00:31:30,00:31:33,thought I was moving from my original location
00:31:33,00:31:35,and ordered mess sergeant to arrest me.
00:31:35,00:31:38,And since then I am under arrest.
00:31:38,00:31:40,All that is true.
00:31:40,00:31:43,This officer is supposedly called James Squid.
00:31:43,00:31:45,I have no evidence that there was ever anyone
00:31:45,00:31:46,called James Squid.
00:31:46,00:31:47,- I looked as well.
00:31:47,00:31:47,I couldn't find any.
00:31:47,00:31:49,"- Nothing in the newspaper archives,"
00:31:49,00:31:51,"nothing in old books, nothing."
00:31:51,00:31:55,"- Also, it just feels like Squid wasn't anyone's surname."
00:31:55,00:31:57,"- Well, it is."
00:31:57,00:31:58,There are people called Squid.
00:31:58,00:32:00,I looked on one of those genealogy websites
00:32:00,00:32:01,where you can see families.
00:32:01,00:32:03,"Squid was a surname back in the day,"
00:32:03,00:32:05,but there's no notable Squids.
00:32:05,00:32:07,"If you go to Wikipedia, notable Squids."
00:32:07,00:32:08,"- Notable Squids, empty page."
00:32:08,00:32:09,- Empty page.
00:32:09,00:32:11,"- Wow, sorted out the Squids."
00:32:11,00:32:13,- Jimmy Wales.
00:32:13,00:32:17,"- Well, he's only interested in the larger marine levels."
00:32:17,00:32:18,"- Wow, James Squid."
00:32:18,00:32:20,- And this is a thing that certainly the people
00:32:20,00:32:21,"who live in the Landikatal,"
00:32:21,00:32:23,"which is the place where this tree is,"
00:32:23,00:32:26,which is in the Khyber region of northern Pakistan
00:32:26,00:32:28,"near the border with Afghanistan,"
00:32:28,00:32:30,"the people there, it's the story,"
00:32:30,00:32:32,the local story is that this happened.
00:32:32,00:32:34,And I think one reason possibly that it's still there
00:32:34,00:32:39,is they wanted to remind people of the colonial times
00:32:39,00:32:42,and the bad things that the British colonists
00:32:42,00:32:43,brought to the area.
00:32:43,00:32:45,"And yeah, remember the bad times."
00:32:45,00:32:45,- I've got a question.
00:32:45,00:32:46,- Yeah.
00:32:46,00:32:49,- What's it chained to?
00:32:49,00:32:50,- The ground.
00:32:50,00:32:51,"- The ground, I see."
00:32:51,00:32:52,And the reason it's changed to the ground
00:32:52,00:32:55,is because so that it can't run away.
00:32:55,00:32:57,Because the reason James Squid had it arrested
00:32:57,00:33:00,"is while he was riding home one night, it leapt at him."
00:33:00,00:33:02,It made a sudden movement.
00:33:02,00:33:03,"And he's like, whoa there."
00:33:03,00:33:05,"- It was quite a windy night, wasn't it?"
00:33:05,00:33:07,(laughing)
00:33:07,00:33:09,"- So he claims drunkenly, supposedly drunkenly."
00:33:09,00:33:12,And I say supposedly it's about a possible fictional human.
00:33:12,00:33:14,It's a possible fictional human.
00:33:14,00:33:17,- We don't even believe the fictional human's drunk story.
00:33:17,00:33:19,- It sounds like James Squid has a lot of questions
00:33:19,00:33:22,"to answer himself, but can't answer them."
00:33:22,00:33:23,"- Yeah, it's said to have."
00:33:23,00:33:25,"- Well, they can walk, can't they?"
00:33:25,00:33:26,- They can.
00:33:26,00:33:28,"- So, and they do walk quite slowly."
00:33:28,00:33:30,"- Sorry, could we unpack this a bit?"
00:33:30,00:33:32,"- Yeah, so they possibly don't walk fast enough"
00:33:32,00:33:34,"to jump out at you on a dark night,"
00:33:34,00:33:36,but they are an extraordinary tree.
00:33:36,00:33:38,"They're known as Strangler Figs,"
00:33:38,00:33:41,because the way they grow is they start out as a seed
00:33:41,00:33:44,"that's put out of a bird or whatever,"
00:33:44,00:33:46,"or blown onto the branch of another tree,"
00:33:46,00:33:49,and then they drop their roots from that branch.
00:33:49,00:33:51,"- That's the crate, have you guys heard that before?"
00:33:51,00:33:52,I'd never heard of that.
00:33:52,00:33:54,That is extraordinary.
00:33:54,00:33:56,It just takes over a tree from the outside.
00:33:56,00:33:58,"- Yeah, it kills it."
00:33:58,00:34:02,"- Yes, and then it kills the inner tree."
00:34:02,00:34:06,The banyan then becomes what's called a columnar tree.
00:34:06,00:34:08,So there's a hollow column in the middle of it
00:34:08,00:34:10,"where the previous tree was,"
00:34:10,00:34:11,and then all sorts of animals get to live
00:34:11,00:34:13,inside that hollow bit.
00:34:13,00:34:15,- It's like the magic faraway tree.
00:34:15,00:34:16,- But the walking.
00:34:16,00:34:17,"- Yeah, what's the walking?"
00:34:17,00:34:18,I still don't believe they walk.
00:34:18,00:34:22,- So the walking is if you've got your original root
00:34:22,00:34:25,"that's been dropped from the branch of a tree,"
00:34:25,00:34:28,"and that embeds itself, and that's essentially the trunk,"
00:34:28,00:34:29,"and then it's rooted into the ground,"
00:34:29,00:34:32,and then it grows up again from the roots and it grows out.
00:34:32,00:34:34,So you have these things that look like forests
00:34:34,00:34:37,of lots of trees that are just one tree
00:34:37,00:34:38,because it keeps on growing up from the roots
00:34:38,00:34:41,and then dropping roots down again and then going up again.
00:34:41,00:34:46,And then often the original trunk will get diseased
00:34:46,00:34:47,and have to be removed.
00:34:47,00:34:49,And then I say that that's walking
00:34:49,00:34:51,because it's lifted up that leg
00:34:51,00:34:53,and taken it out of that position
00:34:53,00:34:54,and moved it to the next position.
00:34:54,00:34:55,"- It hasn't moved it to the next position,"
00:34:55,00:34:56,it's just been removed.
00:34:56,00:34:57,It's just died a bit apitated.
00:34:57,00:34:58,- But the new trunk.
00:34:58,00:35:00,- It's grown another leg.
00:35:00,00:35:01,"- The roots that come down,"
00:35:01,00:35:03,one of those will become the major trunk.
00:35:03,00:35:03,"- Yes, that's right."
00:35:03,00:35:05,I was forgetting that definition of walking
00:35:05,00:35:06,"where I have my leg apitated,"
00:35:06,00:35:07,"but then I grow a new leg,"
00:35:07,00:35:10,which I put somewhere slightly different.
00:35:10,00:35:13,And then do this a series of times over a century
00:35:13,00:35:15,and end up going about 10 feet.
00:35:15,00:35:17,"Yes, walking, love to go for a walk."
00:35:17,00:35:19,(all laughing)
00:35:19,00:35:20,"- Look, when you're a tree,"
00:35:20,00:35:22,"you have to take everything you get, right?"
00:35:22,00:35:23,"- That's true, that's true."
00:35:23,00:35:24,- It's not running.
00:35:24,00:35:26,(all laughing)
00:35:26,00:35:29,- I saw a massive banyan tree this morning.
00:35:29,00:35:30,- Yeah?
00:35:30,00:35:31,"- It's humongous, it's in India."
00:35:31,00:35:32,- How big?
00:35:32,00:35:33,- We're talking about 4.7 acres.
00:35:33,00:35:35,"But this is how big it is,"
00:35:35,00:35:37,what Anna was mentioning about the idea
00:35:37,00:35:39,that these roots grow back out through the ground.
00:35:39,00:35:42,So they're called aerial roots.
00:35:42,00:35:43,They look like their own trees.
00:35:43,00:35:45,"This one has 2,800 of them."
00:35:45,00:35:47,That's how many it's grown.
00:35:47,00:35:49,"And the original trunk, like Anna was mentioning"
00:35:49,00:35:50,"about the other one,"
00:35:50,00:35:52,also has been diseased and chopped away.
00:35:52,00:35:54,So even the original leg is no longer there.
00:35:54,00:35:55,- They're pretty amazing.
00:35:55,00:35:56,"They're so big that these trees,"
00:35:56,00:35:58,"these really, really massive ones,"
00:35:58,00:36:01,"I reckon shelter 20,000 people."
00:36:01,00:36:02,So let's say it's raining
00:36:02,00:36:06,"and you're with 19,999 friends"
00:36:06,00:36:07,and you all need to keep dry.
00:36:07,00:36:09,You can just all slip underneath one of these trees.
00:36:09,00:36:11,- Or you're Jack Foley.
00:36:11,00:36:12,You've just pulled off a job
00:36:12,00:36:14,and you need to make it sound like
00:36:14,00:36:16,"there are 20,000 of you hiding under a tree."
00:36:16,00:36:17,(all laughing)
00:36:17,00:36:18,"Yeah, I understand."
00:36:18,00:36:20,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:36:20,00:36:21,"20,000 people though, that is a lot of people."
00:36:21,00:36:22,- That's a lot.
00:36:22,00:36:25,"- If you think of most lower division football stadiums,"
00:36:25,00:36:27,"Tremere Rovers who I support,"
00:36:27,00:36:28,"like that's twice as many,"
00:36:28,00:36:30,more than twice as many of people
00:36:30,00:36:31,who go and watch Tremere every week.
00:36:31,00:36:34,- So people could leave Tremere one week
00:36:34,00:36:35,and all hide under the same tree
00:36:35,00:36:38,and the next week a completely different crowd of fans
00:36:38,00:36:40,"could turn up, join the initial crowd"
00:36:40,00:36:40,under the previous tree.
00:36:40,00:36:41,"- And the other crowd are like,"
00:36:41,00:36:43,"""What was the scar cause we just missed the match"
00:36:43,00:36:45,"cause we're hiding under this tree."""
00:36:45,00:36:47,"- Or in fact, cause I think the biggest one"
00:36:47,00:36:49,is about three football pitches.
00:36:49,00:36:52,So you could all crowd around the outside of the tree
00:36:52,00:36:53,and then three teams could play
00:36:53,00:36:55,three different matches underneath it.
00:36:55,00:36:56,Although there are shed loads of branches in the way
00:36:56,00:36:57,so actually that wouldn't work.
00:36:57,00:36:59,"- Hang on, three football pitches,"
00:36:59,00:37:01,"you can get six teams on there, can't you?"
00:37:01,00:37:02,- That's such good football knowledge.
00:37:02,00:37:03,- I'm not a football expert
00:37:03,00:37:06,but I think you can have two teams on the same pitch
00:37:06,00:37:07,and it fits a really exciting match.
00:37:07,00:37:09,(laughing)
00:37:09,00:37:14,- So there's a story that there's a prison
00:37:14,00:37:17,in the Shabakodar area
00:37:17,00:37:20,and it's called Shabakodar Fort.
00:37:20,00:37:22,"And in the 1800s, 1840,"
00:37:22,00:37:24,there was a group of warriors that attacked it
00:37:24,00:37:27,and they went inside and there was a big clash
00:37:27,00:37:29,and it went on all night long
00:37:29,00:37:32,and the Sikh people who were in there fought back
00:37:32,00:37:34,and they managed to get them out.
00:37:34,00:37:35,"But there was this huge thing going,"
00:37:35,00:37:37,"""How the hell did they get in here?"
00:37:37,00:37:39,"""Someone's responsible for this, they need to pay."""
00:37:39,00:37:42,"And so they had a big court case as it were,"
00:37:42,00:37:46,like a big inquisition into working out who did this.
00:37:46,00:37:47,And they came up with a verdict.
00:37:47,00:37:49,And the verdict was it was the fault
00:37:49,00:37:52,of the wooden doors that let them in.
00:37:52,00:37:55,"And as a result, the wooden doors have been arrested"
00:37:55,00:37:56,"and have been hanging in the tower,"
00:37:56,00:38:00,chained up much like this tree ever since the 1840s
00:38:00,00:38:01,and they're still chained up.
00:38:01,00:38:03,"- Wow, that's the scapegoat, isn't it?"
00:38:03,00:38:05,The scape door. - Yes.
00:38:05,00:38:06,- Not the escape door.
00:38:06,00:38:09,That's awful if you try and get out through the scape door
00:38:09,00:38:11,and you just walk into the door recently.
00:38:11,00:38:15,"- So wow, this might be a thing,"
00:38:15,00:38:20,like a trend of chaining up trees or wood.
00:38:20,00:38:21,- Yes.
00:38:21,00:38:22,- I've not heard of it happening anywhere else.
00:38:22,00:38:25,I did look for arrested trees and you don't find any others.
00:38:25,00:38:29,"- No, no, and this slightly predates your tree as well"
00:38:29,00:38:30,by about 40 years or so.
00:38:30,00:38:31,"- And also these are wooden doors,"
00:38:31,00:38:33,so they were trees a lot before that.
00:38:33,00:38:36,"- Yeah, we don't know how old the doors were."
00:38:36,00:38:38,- We don't know.
00:38:38,00:38:39,- Food for thought.
00:38:39,00:38:44,- Do some Banyan trees have bells hanging off them
00:38:44,00:38:47,so you can ring the bell to access the spirit
00:38:47,00:38:48,at the top of them?
00:38:48,00:38:48,- Cool.
00:38:48,00:38:52,"- What is the spirit, is it a helpful spirit?"
00:38:52,00:38:53,"- Goddess, well they're very sacred."
00:38:53,00:38:55,"So yeah, it's a positive thing."
00:38:55,00:38:56,There's lots of mythology around them
00:38:56,00:38:58,'cause they are quite extraordinary trees.
00:38:58,00:39:01,"They feature quite heavily in Hindu mythology, in fact."
00:39:01,00:39:05,I think there's Hindu texts from like 500 BC
00:39:05,00:39:08,that say the entire universe is an upside down Banyan tree.
00:39:08,00:39:12,And so it's growing from the heavens down to us
00:39:12,00:39:14,"and then it's leaves a little aphorisms,"
00:39:14,00:39:16,little bits of wisdom.
00:39:16,00:39:20,"And there's, I mean, women wrap threads around them,"
00:39:20,00:39:22,"don't they, there's a festival in India."
00:39:22,00:39:27,"Vat Purnima, which I think means Banyan full moon"
00:39:27,00:39:30,and married women go for three days
00:39:30,00:39:31,"and hang out with Banyan trees,"
00:39:31,00:39:33,wrapping threads around them as a way of--
00:39:33,00:39:33,- Why?
00:39:33,00:39:35,- 'Cause they love their husband so much.
00:39:35,00:39:36,It's pretty gross.
00:39:36,00:39:37,"- There is, yeah, a lot of it is,"
00:39:37,00:39:39,"it's a bit like, what do you call it,"
00:39:39,00:39:41,"like a Hindu almost, right?"
00:39:41,00:39:42,'Cause all the women go together.
00:39:42,00:39:43,"- But a married woman, a Hindu."
00:39:43,00:39:45,"- But they're only married, yeah."
00:39:45,00:39:48,"- That's an, I reckon that's the next place"
00:39:48,00:39:49,for the Hindu market to go.
00:39:49,00:39:50,- The Banyan trees?
00:39:50,00:39:52,"- No, just like married Hindus."
00:39:52,00:39:54,I think that could be a huge thing.
00:39:54,00:39:56,- So what are you celebrating then?
00:39:56,00:39:58,"- Getting away from your husband for a bit, probably."
00:39:58,00:39:59,"- Yeah, nice."
00:39:59,00:40:00,- How much you love him?
00:40:00,00:40:01,"- Oh, sorry, yeah."
00:40:01,00:40:02,"Well, that's how it's sold,"
00:40:02,00:40:03,but everyone who goes on it knows
00:40:03,00:40:05,we're going for a fun party.
00:40:05,00:40:06,"- Well, if we love our husband so much,"
00:40:06,00:40:08,why we go to a strip club in Blackpool?
00:40:08,00:40:11,(all laughing)
00:40:11,00:40:13,- There's a tree in the middle of it.
00:40:13,00:40:14,- Stop tying ribbons to that.
00:40:14,00:40:16,(all laughing)
00:40:16,00:40:17,- To that guy's trunk.
00:40:17,00:40:19,(all laughing)
00:40:19,00:40:20,"Oh my God, he's got an aerial route."
00:40:20,00:40:23,(upbeat music)
00:40:23,00:40:29,"- Okay, it's time for our final fact of the show."
00:40:29,00:40:31,That is Anna.
00:40:31,00:40:33,- My fact this week is that Pad Thai
00:40:33,00:40:37,was invented as part of a fascist government initiative.
00:40:37,00:40:38,- Wow.
00:40:38,00:40:40,"- And every time you eat it,"
00:40:40,00:40:41,you are supporting fascism.
00:40:41,00:40:42,"- Oh, shit."
00:40:42,00:40:45,"- Yeah, I know, awkward, 'cause it's delicious."
00:40:45,00:40:47,"- Well, this last time you all had Pad Thai,"
00:40:47,00:40:49,I reckon that I had it this weekend.
00:40:49,00:40:50,- About two weeks ago.
00:40:50,00:40:51,"- Yeah, same."
00:40:51,00:40:52,- Yeah.
00:40:52,00:40:53,- I'm not sure I've ever had Pad Thai.
00:40:53,00:40:55,"- Well, you're very liberal out here."
00:40:55,00:40:56,- 'Cause of my principles.
00:40:56,00:40:59,(all laughing)
00:40:59,00:41:00,- This is an amazing thing.
00:41:00,00:41:04,"It's from Thailand, hence the name."
00:41:04,00:41:06,"And it was essentially invented,"
00:41:06,00:41:09,"sort of by the leader of Thailand,"
00:41:09,00:41:12,"a guy called Phoeban, full name Luang Phoeban Songkram."
00:41:12,00:41:15,"And he was a big populist leader in the 1930s,"
00:41:15,00:41:19,that era of big populist leaders who became fascists.
00:41:19,00:41:19,And so--
00:41:19,00:41:21,- Thank God we got out of that era.
00:41:21,00:41:22,(all laughing)
00:41:22,00:41:23,"- Well, indeed."
00:41:23,00:41:25,- How times have changed.
00:41:25,00:41:30,And he became essentially dictator of Thailand in 1938.
00:41:30,00:41:33,"And he was very anti-China, a very nationalist,"
00:41:33,00:41:36,as was the way with sort of fascist-leaning dictators.
00:41:36,00:41:39,And he wanted to stamp tiness onto everything
00:41:39,00:41:41,and make everything very Thai.
00:41:41,00:41:43,There were loads of Chinese people in Thailand at the time.
00:41:43,00:41:46,"They tended to sell most of the street food, for instance."
00:41:46,00:41:48,So all the food had Chinese influences.
00:41:48,00:41:51,He wanted to scratch that and create this new dish.
00:41:51,00:41:54,And it's not totally clear who invented it.
00:41:54,00:41:56,His son claims that it was in their household
00:41:56,00:41:58,that it was invented and they used to have it
00:41:58,00:41:59,as a family together.
00:41:59,00:42:02,Other people say maybe he ran a competition to invent it.
00:42:02,00:42:05,"But essentially, he published and promoted this recipe"
00:42:05,00:42:08,for Pad Thai to incorporate lots of nice Thai tweaks
00:42:08,00:42:10,and made everyone eat it.
00:42:10,00:42:11,- That's interesting.
00:42:11,00:42:13,"I did read that it's not Thai,"
00:42:13,00:42:17,that it's a Chinese meal which has been sort of adopted.
00:42:17,00:42:18,- Did you see that?
00:42:18,00:42:22,"- Well, it is because China and Thailand"
00:42:22,00:42:24,are all kind of noodle or rice-based stuff.
00:42:24,00:42:26,It does use Chinese noodles.
00:42:26,00:42:28,It basically took Chinese noodle dishes
00:42:28,00:42:30,and added lots of tiness to it.
00:42:30,00:42:34,"So the Thai bits are things like the palm sugar,"
00:42:34,00:42:35,"that real nice sweet sugariness,"
00:42:35,00:42:37,the chili tamarind flavor that you get.
00:42:37,00:42:38,That was all Thai.
00:42:38,00:42:40,"- Also, bean sprouts, you don't really,"
00:42:40,00:42:42,"is very Thai, which is on top."
00:42:42,00:42:44,"- But yeah, it wasn't like a pizza."
00:42:44,00:42:45,They had to work with what they had.
00:42:45,00:42:48,And what they had was the same ingredients as Chinese food.
00:42:48,00:42:51,"- Yeah, actually, you were saying about the food vendors,"
00:42:51,00:42:54,"all being Chinese, any foreign food vendors"
00:42:54,00:42:56,were banned by Phoeban.
00:42:56,00:42:57,"They said, ""You're not allowed to do that."""
00:42:57,00:43:00,And the government kind of bought a load of food carts
00:43:00,00:43:02,"and then got people to run them and said,"
00:43:02,00:43:06,"""Right, you've got to sell Pad Thai from these food carts."""
00:43:06,00:43:09,They made it so that everyone had to eat
00:43:09,00:43:10,at certain times every day
00:43:10,00:43:13,and you were allowed no more than four meals a day
00:43:13,00:43:17,because this was the Thai way as opposed to the Chinese way.
00:43:17,00:43:18,You were supposed to--
00:43:18,00:43:18,"- It's not that rigorous, is it?"
00:43:18,00:43:22,- How many meals a day?
00:43:22,00:43:25,"- I was like, ""Well, snacks are allowed."""
00:43:25,00:43:26,"- I think that might not be, I don't think so."
00:43:26,00:43:29,- I have some pretty hefty snacks.
00:43:29,00:43:30,"I only have three meals a day,"
00:43:30,00:43:32,"but if you add in snacks, I'm shading snacks."
00:43:32,00:43:33,"- I think you're not allowed,"
00:43:33,00:43:36,you wouldn't be allowed in 1930s Thailand.
00:43:36,00:43:39,He was the one who changed the name to Thailand from Siam.
00:43:39,00:43:39,- Yes.
00:43:39,00:43:41,- He mandated that everyone had to sleep
00:43:41,00:43:43,"six to eight hours a day,"
00:43:43,00:43:45,which apparently was also a Thai thing
00:43:45,00:43:46,as opposed to a Chinese thing.
00:43:46,00:43:48,And he said that everyone had to wear hats.
00:43:48,00:43:50,- How was the Chinese eating 15 meals a day
00:43:50,00:43:51,and sleeping for 21 hours?
00:43:51,00:43:53,- It appears that way.
00:43:53,00:43:54,- It wasn't even just hats.
00:43:54,00:43:56,You had to make sure you wore shoes.
00:43:56,00:43:59,"If there were photos of people without hats and shoes in them,"
00:43:59,00:44:02,they were painted on onto the actual photo itself.
00:44:02,00:44:03,- Really?
00:44:03,00:44:05,"- Yeah, all these, he made sure that,"
00:44:05,00:44:07,and this was an order that you had to kiss.
00:44:07,00:44:08,"This is if you were a male worker,"
00:44:08,00:44:11,you had to kiss your wife before you left for work.
00:44:11,00:44:12,That was part of the mandate.
00:44:12,00:44:15,- I do think that's nice.
00:44:15,00:44:18,"- If you have to, it takes the meaning off it."
00:44:18,00:44:19,- You're absolutely right.
00:44:19,00:44:21,- If you go to work and give your wife a kiss
00:44:21,00:44:23,"and she knows that if you don't do it,"
00:44:23,00:44:24,you're gonna be arrested.
00:44:24,00:44:26,I think it takes a lot of love out there.
00:44:26,00:44:27,- And sometimes you've had a tiff
00:44:27,00:44:30,and you actually want to make a point.
00:44:30,00:44:31,- Yeah.
00:44:31,00:44:33,"- And you're like, I hate you so much."
00:44:33,00:44:34,I'm willing to be arrested
00:44:34,00:44:37,by the fascist governments of Thailand.
00:44:37,00:44:40,- That actually really makes the point much more effectively.
00:44:40,00:44:43,"They're just saying, sorry, train, gotta go, gotta go."
00:44:43,00:44:45,"- Well, the reason we all think it's nice"
00:44:45,00:44:46,is 'cause we are Westerners
00:44:46,00:44:47,and that's why he was trying to--
00:44:47,00:44:49,"- Oh, he was trying to Westernize."
00:44:49,00:44:52,"- Yeah, it was just absolutely bang on classic,"
00:44:52,00:44:54,"but like desperately trying to Westernize and modernize,"
00:44:54,00:44:57,"partly because, partly our fault he came about"
00:44:57,00:45:00,"because Thailand or Siam had never been conquered,"
00:45:00,00:45:03,never really been colonized by the West
00:45:03,00:45:04,unlike pretty much everywhere else in that area.
00:45:04,00:45:06,- Sounds like it was explicitly not our fault.
00:45:06,00:45:07,"- No, but wait for it."
00:45:07,00:45:08,"- Oh, no."
00:45:08,00:45:10,It felt like they were in danger of being colonized
00:45:10,00:45:12,'cause we weren't over that phase of history at the time
00:45:12,00:45:14,"and they were like, the reason we haven't been colonized"
00:45:14,00:45:16,"is because we're really cultured, we're civilized,"
00:45:16,00:45:18,"you know, Westerners think that we don't need to be colonized"
00:45:18,00:45:21,and we need to kind of persuade the West
00:45:21,00:45:24,not to invade us by Westernizing and modernizing massively
00:45:24,00:45:26,and that's gonna mean kissing our wives
00:45:26,00:45:29,and that's why the Brits didn't invade Thailand.
00:45:29,00:45:32,We saw they were kissing their wives as they left
00:45:32,00:45:34,and that was the idea.
00:45:34,00:45:35,- And wearing hats.
00:45:35,00:45:37,"- And wearing hats, yeah."
00:45:37,00:45:38,- Can't possibly arrest all these good chaps
00:45:38,00:45:40,who are going around wearing hats and kissing their wives.
00:45:40,00:45:41,- Precisely.
00:45:41,00:45:42,- Wow.
00:45:42,00:45:43,- You've got a British mentality of the 1930s.
00:45:43,00:45:45,"- Yeah, it's not the first time I've heard that either."
00:45:45,00:45:48,- He banned listening to American and European music though.
00:45:48,00:45:50,Why would he do that?
00:45:50,00:45:53,"- Well, again, he wanted to get the Thai culture."
00:45:53,00:45:54,"- Okay, I guess so."
00:45:54,00:45:56,- He ordered every single household
00:45:56,00:45:58,"to have a picture of him in their homes,"
00:45:58,00:46:01,"classic fascist behavior, that's vintage stuff"
00:46:01,00:46:04,and also theater and cinema audiences
00:46:04,00:46:06,had to bow to an image of him
00:46:06,00:46:08,before each viewing of the screening of the film
00:46:08,00:46:10,or the performance of the play.
00:46:10,00:46:11,- Really?
00:46:11,00:46:14,"- Oh, well that's fine, 'cause 1930s cinema and theater."
00:46:14,00:46:15,- You had to bow to Boris Johnson
00:46:15,00:46:17,"before you see one man, two governors."
00:46:17,00:46:19,"- You got to stand up and sing ""God Save the Queen"""
00:46:19,00:46:21,in the cinemas before a movie
00:46:21,00:46:23,"and at the end of the movie, that's what happened here."
00:46:23,00:46:24,"Like, it's not any different."
00:46:24,00:46:27,"- They said that same thing, yeah."
00:46:27,00:46:29,"He had to use forks and spoons, national cutlery,"
00:46:29,00:46:31,got rid of chopsticks.
00:46:31,00:46:34,"Again, it's this weird hybrid of persuading the West"
00:46:34,00:46:35,"that we're Westernized and modern,"
00:46:35,00:46:37,but also keeping real Tainas.
00:46:37,00:46:39,Typhoon with forks and spoons.
00:46:39,00:46:41,"And also, they went through all these popular songs"
00:46:41,00:46:44,"and they took out, if any popular folk songs"
00:46:44,00:46:46,"mentioned other ethnicities that weren't Thai,"
00:46:46,00:46:48,they were rewritten.
00:46:48,00:46:50,"So, if you were Lao or if you were Burmese,"
00:46:50,00:46:51,'cause there were lots of different ethnicities
00:46:51,00:46:55,"in Thailand at the time, then couldn't sing it anymore."
00:46:55,00:46:56,- Really? - Wow.
00:46:56,00:46:59,"- So if you had the song ""The Irish Rover"","
00:46:59,00:47:01,did they rewrite it as the Thai Rover?
00:47:01,00:47:02,"- Yeah, and that was one of the most popular songs"
00:47:02,00:47:03,at the time.
00:47:03,00:47:05,(laughing)
00:47:05,00:47:06,- I don't think of any other songs
00:47:06,00:47:08,which had an ethnicity of them.
00:47:08,00:47:09,- See.
00:47:09,00:47:11,"- But so, they would send the artist back into the studio."
00:47:11,00:47:13,It wouldn't be like the DJ at the radio station
00:47:13,00:47:16,would just come in and just say a new word
00:47:16,00:47:17,over a song playing.
00:47:17,00:47:19,"- Well, this is where Andy's Foley Artist comes in,"
00:47:19,00:47:20,isn't it?
00:47:20,00:47:23,They employed Jack Foley to say the word Thai
00:47:23,00:47:25,over everything else.
00:47:25,00:47:26,"- Actually, it doesn't sound like Thai"
00:47:26,00:47:27,if you say the word Thai.
00:47:27,00:47:29,"You have to say the word Swiss,"
00:47:29,00:47:31,because that better creates the sound of the word Thai.
00:47:31,00:47:33,(laughing)
00:47:33,00:47:35,"- Anyway, it was a fascist bad guy."
00:47:35,00:47:36,- Yeah.
00:47:36,00:47:37,- They had a noodles song as well.
00:47:37,00:47:38,"- Oh, yeah."
00:47:38,00:47:40,"- Yeah, yeah, Thai, 'cause it's, do you wanna hear it?"
00:47:40,00:47:41,"- Yes, please."
00:47:41,00:47:42,- It sounds so fun.
00:47:42,00:47:43,"- I love two, three, four."
00:47:43,00:47:46,"- Noodles, noodles, noodles, it's how it starts."
00:47:46,00:47:48,Thai vegetables are wealth in the ground.
00:47:48,00:47:49,You can find it anywhere.
00:47:49,00:47:51,Keep buying and selling as Thai people
00:47:51,00:47:52,always help each other.
00:47:52,00:47:53,"Noodles, noodles."
00:47:53,00:47:55,"I imagine something's been lost in translation,"
00:47:55,00:47:58,but the tune.
00:47:58,00:48:00,(laughing)
00:48:00,00:48:01,- Do you know we've only just worked out
00:48:01,00:48:03,how to break a noodle in half?
00:48:03,00:48:04,(laughing)
00:48:04,00:48:05,- Not true.
00:48:05,00:48:07,"- Scientists have, well, okay, 2018."
00:48:07,00:48:10,(laughing)
00:48:10,00:48:13,"Four years ago, this is like a straight noodle"
00:48:13,00:48:14,"or a bit of spaghetti,"
00:48:14,00:48:17,and it's just impossible to snap it in half
00:48:17,00:48:18,if you try doing it.
00:48:18,00:48:19,"- Oh, yeah."
00:48:19,00:48:20,- It's really interesting.
00:48:20,00:48:21,"If you're at home now,"
00:48:21,00:48:23,"like get a piece of long piece of spaghetti,"
00:48:23,00:48:24,a long spaghetti.
00:48:24,00:48:25,(laughing)
00:48:25,00:48:28,"You hold both ends of it and then start to bend, right?"
00:48:28,00:48:29,"Until it snaps,"
00:48:29,00:48:31,you'll find that the two bits in your hand
00:48:31,00:48:33,"stay in your hand,"
00:48:33,00:48:35,"and then the bit in the middle comes out,"
00:48:35,00:48:37,so it doesn't break into two pieces.
00:48:37,00:48:38,It always breaks into three.
00:48:38,00:48:39,It's really interesting.
00:48:39,00:48:39,- That is interesting.
00:48:39,00:48:41,"Although if you hold it in the middle, you can."
00:48:41,00:48:42,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:48:42,00:48:44,- That's what they learned in 2018.
00:48:44,00:48:46,(laughing)
00:48:46,00:48:47,"- Andy, if only you'd been there."
00:48:47,00:48:50,"I mean, you could have saved thousands of pounds."
00:48:50,00:48:51,- Yeah.
00:48:51,00:48:52,- So I think I'm a really famous scientist.
00:48:52,00:48:54,"- Richard Feynman was,"
00:48:54,00:48:55,he was obsessed with this problem.
00:48:55,00:48:58,"So he used to stay up all night,"
00:48:58,00:49:01,repeatedly snapping strands of spaghetti.
00:49:01,00:49:04,"Incredibly famous physicists, Richard Feynman."
00:49:04,00:49:05,"- And he died in what, the 80s or 90s,"
00:49:05,00:49:09,"so he never, he's not alive to the graduate."
00:49:09,00:49:12,"See the 2018 innovation, what happened?"
00:49:12,00:49:14,"- Well, he died clutching a noodle."
00:49:14,00:49:17,It flew into his eye and through to his brain.
00:49:17,00:49:21,"We figured out why you can't do it in 2006,"
00:49:21,00:49:24,and that's to do with this kickback wave
00:49:24,00:49:26,that travels through the spaghetti when you snap it
00:49:26,00:49:27,and smashes it up.
00:49:27,00:49:30,But it then took another 12 years
00:49:30,00:49:31,to figure out how to overcome it.
00:49:31,00:49:36,The way you overcome it is you twist the spaghetti 280 degrees.
00:49:36,00:49:39,So almost a full all the way around.
00:49:39,00:49:43,"And then you break it gently, slowly."
00:49:43,00:49:45,And that solves your problem.
00:49:45,00:49:47,"- Yeah, I think if you are at home and you do try that,"
00:49:47,00:49:50,sometimes you break it and it does go into two
00:49:50,00:49:52,and you're really disappointed.
00:49:52,00:49:54,But I think that might be because you've got either too much
00:49:54,00:49:56,or too little moisture in your spaghetti.
00:49:56,00:49:58,"- Yeah, if you try it just without the twist."
00:49:58,00:49:59,"- I'm just saying, don't write it."
00:49:59,00:50:02,"If you break your spaghetti and it breaks it's too straight away,"
00:50:02,00:50:03,then don't write it.
00:50:03,00:50:05,- It's your fault is what we're saying.
00:50:05,00:50:05,"Yeah, yeah."
00:50:05,00:50:09,"So are there any, it feels like a stupid question."
00:50:09,00:50:11,Are there any applications for this?
00:50:11,00:50:12,- Got loads.
00:50:12,00:50:13,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:50:13,00:50:16,- But that's pretty much time to go through.
00:50:16,00:50:20,"- Probably military, PAE systems have probably bought it."
00:50:20,00:50:23,"- You make drones out of a snap spaghetti now, yeah."
00:50:23,00:50:25,- Is it the same principle for anything
00:50:25,00:50:27,that is one big long stick?
00:50:27,00:50:30,As in I'm trying to think of someone doing a pole vote.
00:50:30,00:50:31,"No, sorry."
00:50:31,00:50:32,- A pole vote.
00:50:32,00:50:33,"- No, no, I think pole."
00:50:33,00:50:35,"- Yeah, yeah, a vaulting pole."
00:50:35,00:50:37,They're at one end and we do see them snap
00:50:37,00:50:40,"and they tend to snap in two, I think."
00:50:40,00:50:40,- Do they snap?
00:50:40,00:50:43,"- Yeah, they have snapped from time to time."
00:50:43,00:50:45,"No, I think it's because the spaghetti"
00:50:45,00:50:47,"has got a certain tensile strength that it works,"
00:50:47,00:50:50,"but particularly well with that, I think."
00:50:50,00:50:52,"- Okay, how about in the last year,"
00:50:52,00:50:57,a woman was burgled in a helicopter was dispatched
00:50:57,00:50:59,to the scene of this burglary.
00:50:59,00:51:00,"- Yeah, right."
00:51:00,00:51:03,"- That's a, so it wasn't in Britain then, oh."
00:51:03,00:51:04,"- No, it was because of police funding."
00:51:04,00:51:05,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:51:05,00:51:07,"- Yeah, and the only thing is."
00:51:07,00:51:09,- We were allowed to make references to Tony Blair's
00:51:09,00:51:11,"home office, ""Happiest Corpus"" policies,"
00:51:11,00:51:13,but I'm not allowed to comment on police cuts now.
00:51:13,00:51:16,- Can you just say how many police cuts
00:51:16,00:51:17,do you think you would not have to have
00:51:17,00:51:19,before we could get a helicopter
00:51:19,00:51:21,going to every burglary that happens?
00:51:21,00:51:22,"- All I'm saying is, James,"
00:51:22,00:51:23,"this is a stand for election,"
00:51:23,00:51:25,"that's going to be one of my flagship policies,"
00:51:25,00:51:27,chopper at your house within seven minutes
00:51:27,00:51:29,of the burglary happening.
00:51:29,00:51:32,"- Well this actually, this story does weak"
00:51:32,00:51:33,"of an overfunded police force,"
00:51:33,00:51:35,because the only things that were stolen
00:51:35,00:51:36,were eight pot noodles.
00:51:36,00:51:40,"Not just individual noodles,"
00:51:40,00:51:41,"pot noodles, but like, you know."
00:51:41,00:51:42,- They dispatched a helicopter.
00:51:42,00:51:44,"- Packets, I don't think they knew at the time"
00:51:44,00:51:46,that it was just pot noodles that had been taken
00:51:46,00:51:47,and women just saw.
00:51:47,00:51:49,- Was this woman the queen?
00:51:49,00:51:51,"- Yeah, she loved."
00:51:51,00:51:53,- So we learned earlier that they were using helicopters
00:51:53,00:51:55,to lift up pilchards from the water.
00:51:55,00:51:57,"- Yeah, nutty knower."
00:51:57,00:51:58,"- So you know, and it's like,"
00:51:58,00:52:00,"- What are you saying, we've got spare helicopters"
00:52:00,00:52:00,coming out of our ears?
00:52:00,00:52:01,- Seems like it.
00:52:01,00:52:03,"- Yeah, I think she didn't know at the time"
00:52:03,00:52:05,she just saw this burglar in her garden
00:52:05,00:52:06,"having leapt out of her house, I guess,"
00:52:06,00:52:08,"called the police, they were like,"
00:52:08,00:52:09,"oh God, emergency."
00:52:09,00:52:12,"And it was only later when they interviewed her,"
00:52:12,00:52:13,"they said, what's been taken?"
00:52:13,00:52:15,"And she said, well, actually eight pot noodles."
00:52:15,00:52:17,And she said they took all the beef
00:52:17,00:52:18,"and tomato flavored ones,"
00:52:18,00:52:20,but didn't take the chicken and mushroom ones.
00:52:20,00:52:24,"- Really, that, yeah, I understand that."
00:52:24,00:52:25,"- I was going to say, yeah."
00:52:25,00:52:29,- Have you heard of Watana Panic?
00:52:29,00:52:30,- Say it again.
00:52:30,00:52:31,- Watana Panic.
00:52:31,00:52:32,- No.
00:52:32,00:52:35,"- Watana, it's in Thailand."
00:52:35,00:52:37,It's a noodle soup joint.
00:52:37,00:52:41,"Maybe the Watana family, I don't know."
00:52:41,00:52:43,But it's a place where you can buy noodle soup
00:52:43,00:52:47,and they're one of these places where every day
00:52:47,00:52:49,they take the last bit of the previous soup
00:52:49,00:52:53,"and put it into the next soup, like a perpetual soup."
00:52:53,00:52:54,"And so whenever you, whatever you buy,"
00:52:54,00:52:56,"if you get some of this beef noodles,"
00:52:56,00:52:59,"you might be having stuff from, you know,"
00:52:59,00:53:00,50 years ago.
00:53:00,00:53:01,Isn't it cool?
00:53:01,00:53:02,- That's really cool.
00:53:02,00:53:03,- How long it's been going on?
00:53:03,00:53:06,- It's been going three generations.
00:53:06,00:53:09,We think 45 years and counting.
00:53:09,00:53:12,But I was reading about these perpetual soups
00:53:12,00:53:14,and there's some claims.
00:53:14,00:53:17,"One of them apparently, there was,"
00:53:17,00:53:20,there's one story that there was a perpetual stew
00:53:20,00:53:22,in Perpignan in France
00:53:22,00:53:25,that was going from the 15th century until World War Two.
00:53:25,00:53:28,"- What, then the Nazis bombed it?"
00:53:28,00:53:31,- They ran out of ingredients due to the German occupation
00:53:31,00:53:33,and had to stop the stew.
00:53:33,00:53:34,- You could just water it.
00:53:34,00:53:36,I would have thought you just water it down
00:53:36,00:53:38,"until it's basically water,"
00:53:38,00:53:40,"but keep the stew technically, it's still the stew."
00:53:40,00:53:42,But you've got bigger things on your mind
00:53:42,00:53:44,"when the Nazis are rolling in, so that's fair enough."
00:53:44,00:53:45,"- Yeah, you do."
00:53:45,00:53:47,There was one in Normandy
00:53:47,00:53:49,that apparently was over 300 years old.
00:53:49,00:53:50,"This is kind of turned,"
00:53:50,00:53:54,"this is an article in a newspaper called The Navhyn Times,"
00:53:54,00:53:55,which is from Goa.
00:53:55,00:53:56,"I couldn't find it anywhere else,"
00:53:56,00:53:58,so God knows if this is true.
00:53:58,00:54:00,- They've got an unbelievably good Normandy correspondent.
00:54:00,00:54:02,(laughing)
00:54:02,00:54:03,"- Wait till I tell you why it is,"
00:54:03,00:54:05,because it's so unlikely.
00:54:05,00:54:07,"But also, what a weird thing to make up."
00:54:07,00:54:08,"They said that in Normandy,"
00:54:08,00:54:12,they had a pot which had been bubbling away
00:54:12,00:54:15,for over 300 years.
00:54:15,00:54:16,"It was in a Cistercian abbey,"
00:54:16,00:54:19,and researchers went into this soup
00:54:19,00:54:20,"and like took some tests,"
00:54:20,00:54:23,and they said that there was still some ingredients
00:54:23,00:54:27,in there that had been in the stew for 350 years.
00:54:27,00:54:29,"- What, James, what you're reading"
00:54:29,00:54:30,is the Indian equivalent of the daily experience.
00:54:30,00:54:32,(laughing)
00:54:32,00:54:34,"- But it is like that thing, isn't it?"
00:54:34,00:54:37,"Where if you, every glass of water you drink"
00:54:37,00:54:38,has been through a dinosaur.
00:54:38,00:54:39,"- Yeah, okay."
00:54:39,00:54:40,"- Or, and Hitler."
00:54:40,00:54:41,"- And Hitler, yeah."
00:54:42,00:54:46,"- Which is why I've stopped drinking water, actually."
00:54:46,00:54:47,"Yeah, is there a filter for that?"
00:54:47,00:54:49,(laughing)
00:54:49,00:54:50,"Fittler, it's cool."
00:54:50,00:54:52,"- It hasn't been through,"
00:54:52,00:54:54,"I mean, Hitler didn't drink that much."
00:54:54,00:54:55,I don't think every glass of water--
00:54:55,00:54:57,- I think he was a T-Total.
00:54:57,00:54:59,"- Or is it, is that a thing that is enough?"
00:54:59,00:55:00,- There's enough molecules.
00:55:00,00:55:01,- Yeah.
00:55:01,00:55:02,"- Sorry, sorry, I just remembered."
00:55:02,00:55:04,It's not the whole glass of water.
00:55:04,00:55:06,It's one molecule.
00:55:06,00:55:08,(laughing)
