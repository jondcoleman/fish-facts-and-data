1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,160
 (phone ringing)

2
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:05,740
 (upbeat music)

3
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:12,320
 - Hi, welcome to Drop As Aligned.

4
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:14,560
 This is the audience feedback show

5
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:17,500
 where we go through your emails,

6
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:18,660
 which I've been reading

7
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:20,720
 and these guys haven't seen them at all.

8
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:22,040
 - Emails that you've sent us,

9
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:23,440
 Andy hasn't been going through your emails.

10
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:25,280
 - I've been going through your emails.

11
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:26,120
 (laughs)

12
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:28,160
 And you should be ashamed of yourself actually.

13
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:29,800
 - You're not gonna get ExpressVPN.

14
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:34,800
 - We, we've given you every chance.

15
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:35,680
 - All right, here we go.

16
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:37,280
 Let's start with some spicy meat.

17
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:38,120
 - Oh, great.

18
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:40,680
 - From Ian, Dear Fishers and Elves.

19
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:42,960
 Bob Anderson was mentioned in a recent episode.

20
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:43,840
 - The Darts player.

21
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:45,240
 - The swordsman.

22
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:46,080
 - Okay.

23
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:47,760
 - I don't mean with the ladies.

24
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:48,600
 I mean--

25
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,120
 - The Darth Vader he played.

26
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:52,120
 - Yes, the choreographer of sword fighting.

27
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:54,920
 Who was an Olympic sword champion?

28
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:55,960
 This is an episode you missed, Dan.

29
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:56,800
 - He was a fencer.

30
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:57,920
 - Yeah, he was a fencer, that's right.

31
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:59,360
 And he played Darth Vader.

32
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:01,440
 - He did the physical fights for Darth Vader.

33
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:04,080
 - So David Prowse was Darth Vader in the normal scenes.

34
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:07,800
 - Exactly, I was in the third person to play Vader.

35
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:08,640
 - Did not know that.

36
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:09,480
 - There we go.

37
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:10,320
 Bob Anderson was mentioned.

38
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,240
 You might like to know this.

39
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:13,920
 When talking to Bob after a saber coaching seminar

40
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,000
 decades ago.

41
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
 - Saber coach.

42
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:16,840
 - Pretty cool.

43
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:19,120
 I asked him, who was the most talented swordsman

44
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:21,120
 or woman he'd worked with in Hollywood?

45
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:23,360
 He had no doubt, Madonna.

46
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,040
 - Sorry.

47
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:27,320
 - Was that for the Bond music clip?

48
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:28,160
 - Yes.

49
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:29,920
 - She was a single, she did with lots of,

50
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,920
 she had lots of die another day.

51
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,800
 - Yeah, she did a, and she did the single,

52
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:35,360
 the music video I think with her fencing as well.

53
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:36,200
 - Yeah.

54
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,720
 - Absolute natural fencer apparently.

55
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:40,920
 - I have fenced and it is probably,

56
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:42,680
 of all the spots that I've tried,

57
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:45,440
 the next morning I struggled most to get out of bed.

58
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:46,280
 - Really?

59
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:47,120
 - Yeah.

60
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:47,960
 - How interesting.

61
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:49,120
 - Cause it really stretches muscles

62
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,760
 that you're not really used to stretching.

63
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:51,600
 - Yeah.

64
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,200
 - They groin quite a lot of those groin muscles.

65
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,440
 - Did some fencing.

66
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:56,280
 - Yeah.

67
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,680
 - Yeah, but I didn't experience that,

68
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,840
 but that's because I was eight years old

69
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:00,680
 at the time I was doing it.

70
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:01,520
 - Yeah.

71
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:02,340
 - Right, yes.

72
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:03,180
 - That'll help.

73
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:04,560
 - But you know, it was fun.

74
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,000
 - Like a virgin?

75
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,840
 - Ah, well at the time, yeah.

76
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:10,520
 And for some time afterwards actually.

77
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:13,080
 But that's an incredible, that's great.

78
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:15,080
 Here's one from Peter Dixon.

79
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:17,040
 Recently Anna, I believe, introduced a fact

80
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,000
 about the speed of effluent during its travels

81
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,760
 along sewers being walking pace.

82
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:22,760
 - Oh yes, I think I was off for this one.

83
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:23,800
 - Ah, okay.

84
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,720
 My brain playing snap fact,

85
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:27,560
 immediately responded with the fact

86
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:31,160
 put forward by E.B. White, the great naturalist,

87
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:33,160
 who noted based on years of records

88
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:35,360
 that spring traveled north at walking pace

89
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,700
 in the British Isles.

90
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:37,540
 - That's true.

91
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:39,520
 - Are there other things that move at walking pace?

92
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,360
 - Oh my gosh.

93
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,680
 - Well firstly, E.B. White,

94
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:45,480
 I wouldn't have said naturalist as his opening thing.

95
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:47,080
 Author of Charlotte's Web,

96
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:50,280
 author of one of the handbooks for writing.

97
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,320
 - The one who wrote that guy.

98
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:52,160
 - But it was a naturalist.

99
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,000
 - He did write about nature.

100
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,280
 I think he wrote a lot about nature

101
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,120
 and he loved living in a cell.

102
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:55,940
 - I think we did him on the show, didn't we?

103
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:56,780
 - We did.

104
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:57,620
 - We did section on him, yeah.

105
00:02:57,620 --> 00:03:00,040
 - I mean, what's Charlotte's Web about if not nature?

106
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:03,160
 What is a spider if not a piece of the natural world?

107
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:05,040
 - It's about a talking pig.

108
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:08,120
 (all laughing)

109
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:10,760
 - That is a great part of the super natural world.

110
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:12,480
 (all laughing)

111
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:15,400
 - Yeah, so I mean other things that move at walking pace,

112
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,400
 challenge.

113
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,640
 - Like future shoes.

114
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:18,760
 - When they're walking.

115
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:20,360
 - He said humans are disqualified,

116
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:23,640
 rules out what Tyler, Mao Zedong, Nelson Mandela, et cetera.

117
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:25,320
 (all laughing)

118
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,520
 - That's a very funny joke.

119
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:28,420
 - Classic humans.

120
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:30,040
 - Oh, because the long walk to freedom.

121
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:30,880
 - Exactly, yeah.

122
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,120
 - And Mao Zedong's long march.

123
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:32,960
 - Yeah.

124
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:33,780
 - Sorry, that's, no, that's good.

125
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:34,620
 That's how I've read that.

126
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:35,460
 I didn't get that.

127
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:37,120
 - And what Tyler's presence revolved,

128
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,600
 which I guess was mostly done on foot.

129
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:39,960
 - Hmm.

130
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:42,720
 - Okay, so what other things move at the speed

131
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:43,840
 of a human walking?

132
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,080
 - We can leave it be for the moment

133
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:47,400
 and we can come back to it if you guys think of it.

134
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,560
 - Shrieker, is this like homework?

135
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,520
 Next time, I'll come back with some answers.

136
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,360
 - I'm just gonna write homework.

137
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:56,360
 - The speed of waves rolling onto a sandy beach.

138
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,200
 Lovely.

139
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,320
 - They're usually quite a bit fast.

140
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:59,680
 They're usually a lot faster than that.

141
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,000
 - Oh, no, they could be about that.

142
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,160
 - It's very gentle.

143
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:04,800
 - Yeah, what happens is you walk along the beach

144
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,160
 and then a wave comes along

145
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:08,160
 and you have to jog out of the way of it, don't you?

146
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,600
 So it's slightly more than a walk.

147
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,000
 - Yes, you're right, that's a jog.

148
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,160
 Yes, okay, but good.

149
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,760
 We've eliminated the ocean.

150
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:14,600
 That's good.

151
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:15,440
 (all laughing)

152
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:16,560
 When I got this email from Peter,

153
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,440
 my mind immediately went to,

154
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:19,280
 are you fingering at us?

155
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:22,360
 - No, I go, "Walk, I said it, actually they don't."

156
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:24,320
 - Your fingernails move at the same pace

157
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,400
 as the Earth's tectonic plates.

158
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,240
 - That's what I was thinking of.

159
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,960
 It's different, yeah.

160
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:30,800
 Well, let's move on,

161
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,160
 and we can come back to a walking pace thing.

162
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,000
 - I seem to remember on one of the planets,

163
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,560
 I wanna say it's Mars, but it could be Venus,

164
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:40,040
 that the sunset moves approximately at that pace.

165
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:42,640
 You can walk and like have a forever sunset.

166
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:43,840
 - You're so right.

167
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:44,680
 - That's great.

168
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:45,520
 - We mentioned that recently.

169
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:46,360
 - It is romantic.

170
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:48,600
 - I think it's one of the nearest to the sun planets.

171
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,640
 - I'm gonna say Venus.

172
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:52,240
 - Yeah, well, it's either that or Mercury.

173
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,280
 - Mercury, I'm gonna say Mercury.

174
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,120
 Final answer.

175
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:56,000
 - Anyway, it's very romantic is my point.

176
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:56,960
 That's really, that's lovely.

177
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:57,800
 - That's lovely.

178
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,360
 - Oh, shadows.

179
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,400
 - Oh, that's good, unless you're running.

180
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,440
 (all laughing)

181
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,920
 - Here's one from Aaron.

182
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:07,920
 In a recent episode,

183
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:10,760
 Anna said leeches were kept as pets in the past

184
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,480
 as a leech keeper myself.

185
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:18,160
 I can say leeches are definitely still kept as pets today.

186
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,000
 - Great correction.

187
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,840
 - So many people,

188
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:22,880
 the number of times I've gone into the park

189
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:26,280
 and people are dragging the pet leash on a leech.

190
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:27,320
 Leech on a leash.

191
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:31,520
 - Yeah, it can't move a leech food in the pet shop.

192
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,080
 (all laughing)

193
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:34,240
 Sorry, Aaron, you're right.

194
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:37,800
 It's got a very common thing to do and I take it back.

195
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,440
 - That's so funny.

196
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,760
 Pretty much anything we could say on this podcast,

197
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:44,760
 it'll be like, "Oh, do you know that they used to have bars?"

198
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:47,400
 Some of them write it going, "What do you mean, used to?"

199
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,480
 (all laughing)

200
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:51,600
 Here's one from Alex Bailey.

201
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,120
 On Drop As A Line in October, 2023.

202
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:54,960
 All right.

203
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:58,760
 You were puzzled by a listener who wrote in saying,

204
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:00,920
 "You once claimed the Buddhist monks

205
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,600
 drink through their penises."

206
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:03,440
 - Oh, yeah.

207
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,120
 (all laughing)

208
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,360
 - I listened to the relevant app the other day

209
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,560
 and though I can't tell you the number,

210
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,080
 I can confidently say,

211
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:10,920
 - Oh, God.

212
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,360
 - Sorry, this is a bit blue, this one.

213
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:14,280
 It was about them sucking their semen back in

214
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:17,400
 so as not to waste their life force playing jack-in-lating.

215
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,920
 - Yes.

216
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:21,080
 - And it's the speed of which they suck it back in,

217
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,600
 as I say, there's a walkie-talkie here.

218
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,480
 (all laughing)

219
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:26,400
 - There's another bit of the email saying,

220
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,240
 the second thing is,

221
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,840
 "I lived in Melbourne for many years

222
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:30,960
 and the arpeggio at the start of Wasps

223
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:33,080
 sounds uncannily like the ones that used to play

224
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:35,640
 before the announcement at Flinders Street Station."

225
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:36,480
 - Okay.

226
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:38,000
 - ♪ Do, do, do, do, do ♪

227
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:38,840
 - Yeah.

228
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:39,680
 - That bit.

229
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:40,520
 - Interesting.

230
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:45,520
 - It is interesting because the man who wrote that song

231
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,280
 lived in Australia for a while.

232
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,400
 - Yeah.

233
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,640
 - Maybe that's where he got it.

234
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:51,320
 - So is that part of it?

235
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,640
 Is that plagiarism?

236
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:54,600
 (all laughing)

237
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,600
 - I don't know, but if that was the case,

238
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:59,200
 that would be the second song that I know of

239
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:03,640
 that samples street sound from a,

240
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:06,440
 so Billie Eilish's "Bad Guy."

241
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:08,560
 She samples when you press an Australia

242
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,400
 to go across the road

243
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:16,100
 it makes the noises they sampled that and that's that's part of the drum beat of bad guy. That's good. So that would make it too.

244
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:24,260
 Trying to put in that buzzing noise that your phone makes a vibrating noise because there are some songs I listen to and every point of the song I think, oh, I've got a text. I get that as well.

245
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:33,460
 I think it's probably a coincidence. I think because there are a few tracks that I listen to that that happens. It's annoying, isn't it? Yeah, it's really annoying.

246
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:45,400
 That's my phone only ever goes. No songs ever have that. Well, that is actually that's a song, isn't it? That's an old Spanish classical song.

247
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:55,720
 What's this? Yes, here's one from Adam Rodriguez. On July's episode of Drop As A Line, Andy suggested Old Fish as a name for a segment where people dredge things up from bygone eras.

248
00:07:55,720 --> 00:08:05,720
 I humbly suggest that you instead name it after one of America's first business tycoons, Preserved Fish. Oh, yeah, I remember him. What did he do?

249
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:14,720
 He was one of America's first business tycoons. It's at a Bible name when they just used to name themselves by opening the Bible at random, putting their finger down.

250
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:25,720
 Great name to preserve it. I'm not convinced that he didn't work in some kind of seafood industry as well, trying to remember him. No, isn't that Captain Birdseye?

251
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:35,720
 Yeah, I remember Preserved Fish, but I can't remember the context. It does seem like maybe we'd remember him because we made it a QI fact that he worked in a fish industry.

252
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:44,720
 But maybe just because it's a funny name. And I can imagine Preserved being a biblical name. God has Preserved you.

253
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:56,720
 Ellie Miller of Austin, Texas writes, listening to Dan say the word Australia at the end of episode 538, brackets to rhyme with failure, which I know is normal, but different from the American pronunciation.

254
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:13,720
 Australia. It reminded me of the first ever English language poetry published in Australia. It was by an Englishman barrister named Baron Field, who was a friend of Charles Lamb, who's quite famous, and wrote a 12 page volume of verse in 1819.

255
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:29,720
 And here, just here a few of the lines from it, kangaroo, kangaroo, thou spirit of Australia, that redeems from utter failure and perfect desolation, and warrants the creation of this fifth part of the earth, which would seem an after birth, not conceived in the beginning.

256
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:38,720
 For God blessed his work at first and saw that it was good, but emerged at the first sinning when the ground was therefore cursed, and hence this barren wood.

257
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:49,720
 That's great. That should be the National Anthem. Can you imagine the National Anthem for Australia when they start up going, kangaroo, oh, kangaroo.

258
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:55,720
 So thank you for that, Ellie. It's great. Here's an expert voice. This is brilliant.

259
00:09:55,720 --> 00:10:02,720
 We have a name for that. Dave. No, we don't have a name for that. We should have a sort of sting.

260
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:05,720
 Like a, what would you call them, a boffin?

261
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:15,720
 Yeah, boffin corner. We've got spicy meat. We've got old fish and now like boffin, boffin something. We'll work on it.

262
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:27,720
 Oh, actually, I was going to say we need a fish theme, but isn't boff B-O-F-F is a very feckin female fish, I think.

263
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:34,720
 And fins are what you find on a fish. There we go. It's called boff fins. Yeah, writing it down.

264
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:40,720
 I think it's big old feckin female boff, and that's in terms of fish. Is that genuinely true?

265
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:45,720
 I'm pretty sure. And then fins, as Dan says, are also fish related.

266
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:53,720
 Wow, it's so nice to be there at the moment of creation. Boff fins. Unlike Australia, of course.

267
00:10:53,720 --> 00:11:03,720
 So this is great. On the subject, Dave Pearson says, hello. On the subject of unexploded bombs, I work as a freelance hydrographical survey consultant

268
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:10,720
 to take work playing "Find the Bombs" using radiometers, magnetometers and various sonars.

269
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:16,720
 Building something offshore, like a wind farm or whatever. And he says, I can tell you there are unexploded bombs all over the place.

270
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:25,720
 Do you remember we discussed that one that was in the wash, is it? Or in the Thames? And it's like a huge bomb there.

271
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:30,720
 And one day it might go off and it just blasts the entire south of England.

272
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:36,720
 That sheds a tsunami towards us. And people go out and keep putting things near it.

273
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:45,720
 It is off the coast of Lincoln somewhere, I think. Not in the wash. Like someone's put it in the wash. Don't put your bombs in the wash.

274
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:51,720
 But the reason there are so many is not because of what was dropped in anger. It was if a bomber had to turn back or failed to drop the payload,

275
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:57,720
 they would have to dump their bombs. And so they did that out of the sea, because the sea is there.

276
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:02,720
 So yeah, and he says, for what it's worth, I wouldn't go near them in a tank either. We don't tend to disturb them.

277
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:07,720
 It's just better to spend a bit extra rerouting cables. And then you just move the cables a bit and fine.

278
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:15,720
 Yeah, amazing. Dave from Oakland, California says, the discussion about drovers and herring lasses,

279
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:20,720
 knitting as they made their respective journeys across the country, was pretty cute.

280
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:24,720
 It got me thinking about that as a theme for a folk song in the style of the Decemberists.

281
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:31,720
 I'm not very musically talented, but with the current AI boom, it is pretty trivial to prompt a machine to fill in where talents fail.

282
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:37,720
 And he's attached a song, a lyrics song and lyrics.

283
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:41,720
 And it's the lyrics are thread of fate. It's the name of the song.

284
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:42,720
 Okay.

285
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,720
 Shall I read you the first verse also?

286
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:45,720
 Yeah.

287
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:51,720
 "Drover walks alone in the dawn." Remember, this has come up with AI, so we can be rude about it. That's fine.

288
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:59,720
 "Drover walks alone in the dawn. Herring lass with nets so worn. On the road they meet by chance. Wondering gaze, a fleeting glance.

289
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:09,720
 Thread of yarn between their hands. Tie them close across the lands. Winter's chill and summer's heat. In their hearts the yarn will beat."

290
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,720
 And there are several more verses.

291
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:12,720
 I like it.

292
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:13,720
 That's fine.

293
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:14,720
 I'd buy that.

294
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:15,720
 Pretty good.

295
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:21,720
 Is that in the December, the Russian nobles who rose up against the Tsar in the early 19th century?

296
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:23,720
 Yep, that's right.

297
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:24,720
 That's right.

298
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:28,720
 There's a controversial thing here from Sherry Bluebond.

299
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:35,720
 I was listening to your July 22, I don't know if that's July 2022.

300
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:37,720
 On the 22nd of July.

301
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:38,720
 Probably that.

302
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:43,720
 "Drop as a lion episode. And you folks seem surprised that people in Canada can still buy, I can't believe it's not better."

303
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:46,720
 James, I think this was something you said, I'm so sorry.

304
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:49,720
 Honestly, I think this is what I've had the most correspondence with.

305
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:54,720
 We've had a lot of people saying you can buy it in England, you can buy it here, you can buy it there, you can buy it everywhere.

306
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:55,720
 You buy it in England?

307
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:56,720
 Apparently, yeah.

308
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,720
 I can't believe it.

309
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:03,720
 So why did we think it had gone out of production?

310
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:07,720
 I think you have to go to a very specialist place to get it in England.

311
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:08,720
 Do you? It's not in Tokyo.

312
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:13,720
 There was someone saying I was on Piccadilly's circus, there was an entire stand of ot... I don't know.

313
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:15,720
 But look, this is the only reason I mentioned this.

314
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:16,720
 Yeah.

315
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:21,720
 It's because she's attached a photo, Sherry, of a bottle of squirty, I can't believe it's not butter.

316
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:24,720
 Yeah, that looks like a disinfectant kind of thing.

317
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:27,720
 But weirdly, that is sort of liquid.

318
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:30,720
 That makes it easier for me to believe that it isn't butter.

319
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:31,720
 Yes, Sherry.

320
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:32,720
 You know what I mean?

321
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,720
 Ah, but that's working against the titans.

322
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,720
 Exactly, I can't believe that's not butter.

323
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:37,720
 Yeah, have a look.

324
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:38,720
 Of course.

325
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:41,720
 Yeah, I can't believe it's not washing up liquid.

326
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:43,720
 Yeah, she's in LA.

327
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:44,720
 Oh, yeah.

328
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:47,720
 Well, they have all sorts of LA, don't they?

329
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,720
 I think it is on sale in the UK, though, James.

330
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:51,720
 I never thought it had gone on sale.

331
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:53,720
 I don't know how many censors was that.

332
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:55,720
 They've got all sorts of LA.

333
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:56,720
 I'm just looking.

334
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,720
 It's before days.

335
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:01,720
 I just can't quite see it.

336
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:04,720
 Your one-man campaign against the existence of this product.

337
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:07,720
 It still exists.

338
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:09,720
 If anyone comes on tour and gives me a tub,

339
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:11,720
 if I can't believe it's not butter,

340
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:13,720
 I'll send them a badge.

341
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:17,720
 Only the first person to do it.

342
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:18,720
 Oh, that's great.

343
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,720
 Anyway, yeah, sorry about that.

344
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:23,720
 This is a great one from Nathan Dwyer.

345
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:25,720
 I think this is another boffin.

346
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:27,720
 I've listened to the show since 2021

347
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:30,720
 for 200 hours plus on Spotify each year.

348
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,720
 And I can't thank you all enough for the nearly

349
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,720
 800 hours of entertainment and learning and fun.

350
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:35,720
 It's very nice.

351
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:37,720
 My favourite factory tell is the man who set off

352
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:39,720
 on a 38-day trip across Antarctica,

353
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:41,720
 who only packed one pair of underwear

354
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:44,720
 and shared himself on Day 16.

355
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,720
 It's a great fact.

356
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,720
 I don't remember that.

357
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:49,720
 Yeah, I remember that.

358
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:51,720
 Because he wanted to make room for all the weird snacks

359
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:53,720
 he had, didn't he?

360
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:55,720
 He was saving space.

361
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:57,720
 Was he the one who had all the energy bars?

362
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:58,720
 Yes.

363
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,720
 I think they're called Colin bars or something.

364
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:03,720
 And he had them all in the second day.

365
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:05,720
 And that's why he shot himself, wasn't it?

366
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:07,720
 He lost all self-control.

367
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:10,720
 Anyway, however,

368
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,720
 I think the quote that I've retold the most,

369
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,720
 this is interesting, was Dan's line,

370
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:18,720
 "It's not only happy that dogs wag their tails when they are."

371
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,720
 OK?

372
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,720
 Now, Nathan says...

373
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:25,720
 Maybe that was a bad edit.

374
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:27,720
 Nathan Dwyer says,

375
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:31,720
 "I'm a linguistics PhD student studying syntax."

376
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:33,720
 And this is a perfect example

377
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:37,720
 of what's called an island violation in syntax.

378
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:39,720
 Basically, you're not supposed to be able to move happy

379
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:41,720
 to the front like this in order to focus on the word happy

380
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:43,720
 because it originates in a relative clause

381
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:45,720
 that it cannot be extracted out of. OK.

382
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:47,720
 Can you say the sentence first again?

383
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:51,720
 "It's not only happy that dogs wag their tails when they are."

384
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:56,720
 That actually works for me now that you're in here.

385
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:00,720
 Dan, you do speak a little bit like that,

386
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,720
 but that's fine because that's just the way you are,

387
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:05,720
 but usually I've changed the sentences around.

388
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:07,720
 Yeah, but that's...

389
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:10,720
 I don't know if that's my having learnt Mandarin as a kid as well,

390
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,720
 West Central Structure is in different spots.

391
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,720
 Maybe, though.

392
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,720
 He says, "I'd love to publish a paper someday documenting island violations

393
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:19,720
 in naturalistic speech, and this example would be front and centre."

394
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:21,720
 Great. Yeah.

395
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:23,720
 That's really interesting because that poem about Australia

396
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:25,720
 was a bit of an island violation.

397
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:27,720
 Yes.

398
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:29,720
 Superb.

399
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:31,720
 Hamish Duckmantan.

400
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:33,720
 Brilliant name.

401
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,720
 Hamish Duckmantan.

402
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:37,720
 Duckmantan.

403
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:39,720
 Yeah, beautiful.

404
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:41,720
 "I'm a volunteer firefighter from Victoria, Australia."

405
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:43,720
 Yay.

406
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:45,720
 "And I thought I'd add to your firefighter facts.

407
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:47,720
 In Victoria, we can fill our fire trucks from any water source, including pools."

408
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:49,720
 Cool.

409
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:51,720
 "And they have a lot of fires and areas away from water mains,

410
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:53,720
 so they do need to."

411
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:55,720
 "And they're just repeating the facts that we said."

412
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:57,720
 You know what I mean.

413
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:59,720
 I'm afraid that was almost verbatim

414
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:01,720
 what Anna said on the day.

415
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:03,720
 Okay, here we go. Here's a bet. Well, he goes on.

416
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:05,720
 Yes.

417
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:07,720
 "We also use quite a lot of helicopters because of our large bushfires.

418
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:09,720
 One type is an Erickson Sky Crane,

419
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:11,720
 which can carry 9,000 litres

420
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:13,720
 and suck it up in its snorkel in about a minute.

421
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:15,720
 Okay?

422
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:17,720
 But if it has a long lake available,

423
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:19,720
 it can put down a hard snorkel,

424
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:21,720
 skim across the surface

425
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:23,720
 and suck the water up in half the time."

426
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:25,720
 Lovely.

427
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:27,720
 A hard snorkel.

428
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:29,720
 It sounds filthy. I'm going to put down a hard snorkel.

429
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:31,720
 Give me a hard snorkel.

430
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:33,720
 "You scoop up into your snorkel by just popping it down

431
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:35,720
 and then pushing it along the surface of the water."

432
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:37,720
 Right.

433
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:39,720
 Okay, like a dust pan and brush kind of maneuver.

434
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:41,720
 Pretty good.

435
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:43,720
 No, that is cool and thank you for the work that you do.

436
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:45,720
 Mr Duck Mountain or whatever you're...

437
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:47,720
 Can you go...

438
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:49,720
 Long night on the Duck Mountain.

439
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:51,720
 Yeah.

440
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:53,720
 Arthur Purvis writes,

441
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:55,720
 "I love your podcast.

442
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:57,720
 Your facts are so interesting

443
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,720
 and you always make me laugh in some way or another

444
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:01,720
 like an observation with trams.

445
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:03,720
 Did you know that after..."

446
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:05,720
 This is relevant, actually, and I thought of this.

447
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:07,720
 I wondered if you guys think of the same thing.

448
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:09,720
 Did you know that after Donald Trump was shot in the ear

449
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:11,720
 in the summer of 2024,

450
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:13,720
 many of his supporters bandaged their own ears

451
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:15,720
 in recognition of his injury?"

452
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:17,720
 Yes.

453
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:19,720
 And with a limp who got her limp impersonated.

454
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:21,720
 Princess Alexandra or something.

455
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:23,720
 Dan Martin.

456
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:25,720
 She had a limp and people in the court started,

457
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:27,720
 "Okay, it made me think of

458
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:29,720
 Louis XIV's anal fistula."

459
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:31,720
 Yes.

460
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:33,720
 Remember? Because he had a thing in his bottom

461
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:35,720
 and a lot of people in the court

462
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:37,720
 after he had the operation wore bandages

463
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:39,720
 because it became fashionable.

464
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,720
 And they walked around with bandages on their bums.

465
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:43,720
 Yes, it's the same thing.

466
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:45,720
 That is so interesting, isn't it?

467
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:47,720
 They're a good company.

468
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:49,720
 Big complaint for something I think that I said.

469
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:51,720
 Uh-oh.

470
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:53,720
 Dun, dun, dun.

471
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:55,720
 It's had a couple of complaints on it.

472
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:59,720
 John G. Erickson.

473
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:01,720
 "I am an American with an electric kettle."

474
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:03,720
 Because, yeah, this is going to be you.

475
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:05,720
 "My mother and sister have electric kettles.

476
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:07,720
 Lots of people in America have electric kettles."

477
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:09,720
 None of us have ever seen "I Can't Believe It's Not Butter."

478
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:11,720
 None of us have ever seen "I Can't Believe It's Not Butter."

479
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:13,720
 None of us have ever seen "I Can't Believe It's Not Butter."

480
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:15,720
 Your claim on this week's list that Americans

481
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:17,720
 don't have them is just not true.

482
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:19,720
 I might have claimed it. They have them far, far less.

483
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:21,720
 Come on. Yeah, like, literally,

484
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,720
 Americans, if you're listening to this

485
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:25,720
 and I'm sure some of you are,

486
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:27,720
 tell all your mates that we have them

487
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:29,720
 in every single house.

488
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:31,720
 In every room of the house.

489
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:33,720
 Yeah, more than one kettle, most people.

490
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:35,720
 We've got a thing in our house, by the way,

491
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:37,720
 which is that Finella often buys

492
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:39,720
 her kettles from Europe.

493
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:41,720
 You see why I mean Americans?

494
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:43,720
 Everyone in the house has their own kettles.

495
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:45,720
 The biggest marry Antoine energy

496
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:47,720
 I've ever heard.

497
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:49,720
 So she gets her kettles from

498
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:51,720
 Europe and...

499
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:53,720
 They're fabricates, aren't they?

500
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:55,720
 They keep breaking, right?

501
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:57,720
 And I said to her, "Hun, why do you keep

502
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:59,720
 buying kettles that break? It's a cat like,

503
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:01,720
 how is this possible?" And she said,

504
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,720
 "Stop buying first class, did you leave her?

505
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,720
 You could have bought another one.

506
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:07,720
 Or just buy two on the same flight, please."

507
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:09,720
 So she says

508
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:11,720
 that the reason they keep breaking,

509
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:13,720
 she loves the style of the kettles that they have,

510
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:15,720
 but they keep breaking because

511
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:17,720
 no other country uses kettles

512
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:19,720
 at the rate that the British do.

513
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:21,720
 Therefore, ours are like built to survive.

514
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:23,720
 Whereas, so her rate

515
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:25,720
 of making tea, the kettle is just like,

516
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:27,720
 this is too much and it...

517
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:29,720
 You know what, I think she's absolutely right about that.

518
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:31,720
 But it does, because she...

519
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:33,720
 And it does make me think that now she's

520
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:35,720
 realised that, why is she continuing

521
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:37,720
 to buy the kettles? Oh, because they look great.

522
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:39,720
 You know, it's fashion over...

523
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:41,720
 What I would say to Fen,

524
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:43,720
 and what I will say to her next time we see her,

525
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:45,720
 is buy one for show

526
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:47,720
 and then just have another little one underneath

527
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:49,720
 the counter, a good old British one

528
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:51,720
 that will do it quickly. And then

529
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:53,720
 pour, it's like having a Hendricks

530
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:55,720
 gin bottle that you

531
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:57,720
 pour crap gin into. Yes.

532
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:59,720
 All posh soap bottles, I've actually

533
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:01,720
 done this, those e-soap soap,

534
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:03,720
 just pour your Audi value.

535
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:05,720
 So pour crap kettle, hot water into

536
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:07,720
 the kettle and then bring that up

537
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:09,720
 and say, I'll be using this one for your tea.

538
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:11,720
 One

539
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:13,720
 controversial thing can I just say about tea is that

540
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:15,720
 I think it's better

541
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:17,720
 to have it on a stove top. Now, I

542
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:19,720
 don't, but I grew up because

543
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:21,720
 of, you know, who I am,

544
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:23,720
 in a family that had an aga for some portion

545
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:25,720
 of my life. Yeah, okay,

546
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:27,720
 get over it. And

547
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:29,720
 so we'd boil the kettle on the aga

548
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:31,720
 and that means that you don't, because

549
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:33,720
 you know you mustn't make tea unless

550
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:35,720
 the water is literally boiling. Right.

551
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:37,720
 That's if you've read George Orwell's essay

552
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:39,720
 on tea. So the only way to make tea is that

553
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:41,720
 everyone gather around the aga

554
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:43,720
 we're going to recharge our wells

555
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:45,720
 on the aga tea. I did notice

556
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:47,720
 you were the only one not giving me shit about

557
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:49,720
 vanilla buying European kettles and that came out.

558
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:51,720
 You will have an aga in every room.

559
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:53,720
 Thank you.

560
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:55,720
 Everyone's got a water related

561
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:57,720
 poshness here. So Dan's wife buys

562
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:59,720
 kettles in

563
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:01,720
 my garden.

564
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:03,720
 Anna only will have aga

565
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:05,720
 and James' cat is

566
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:07,720
 slurping up the heavy head. Yeah.

567
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,720
 What's my, I must have, logically I must have

568
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:11,720
 what you will have. We'll find it, we'll find it.

569
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:13,720
 Anyway, the aga you don't have to rush so when the kettle

570
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:15,720
 clicks, do you find yourselves doing that? You have

571
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:17,720
 to sort of stay near the kettle all the time because you have

572
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:19,720
 to rush to it to pour it on the tea.

573
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:21,720
 I'm not as militant as you are. I think you're very

574
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:23,720
 like, it has to be big bubbles

575
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:25,720
 of water and I will sometimes wait 10 seconds.

576
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:27,720
 See, I always got nervous making you tea. There's a thing

577
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:29,720
 which I absolutely didn't take part in.

578
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:31,720
 I feel like James, maybe you didn't as well

579
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:33,720
 where on the wall of the QI office, there's like

580
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:35,720
 a tea chart of how everyone's like,

581
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:37,720
 "I need the bag in for this long, I need this kind of milk."

582
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:39,720
 No, it was I like green tea.

583
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:41,720
 What a great colleague you are that you deserve

584
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:43,720
 so you refuse to acknowledge people's tea

585
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:45,720
 preference because you've never made anyone tea down.

586
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:47,720
 It's fun to make a cup of tea for anyone else's life. That is a lie.

587
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:49,720
 Well, I make tea. You sent mine back

588
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:51,720
 because you're like too milky. I guess I should have looked at the chart.

589
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:53,720
 Well, it was nice to be in the podcast while

590
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:55,720
 I lasted. And wasn't it

591
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:57,720
 predictable that this is how it would end?

592
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:01,720
 Just to drag it back to...

593
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:03,720
 I'm sorry, Dan. You've made me tea in the past, I'm sure.

594
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:05,720
 You should be glad in America you don't have kettles.

595
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:07,720
 You don't have this kind of blowout.

596
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:09,720
 Well, the last time we had a visitor in our home

597
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:11,720
 from America recently

598
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:13,720
 who came down early

599
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:15,720
 in the morning, got the kettle,

600
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:17,720
 filled it up with water, put it on the hob.

601
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:19,720
 Oh.

602
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:21,720
 Melted the kettle.

603
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:23,720
 Housebone down.

604
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:25,720
 Just sort of like this is just

605
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:27,720
 like early morning, not really thinking straight yet.

606
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:29,720
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

607
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:31,720
 Chris Diver.

608
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,720
 I finally subscribed to Club Fish.

609
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:35,720
 Sorry about this, Chris.

610
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:37,720
 Andy keeps mentioning spicy meat.

611
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:39,720
 And I looked online to try and find

612
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:41,720
 what the spiciest meat is.

613
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:43,720
 Oh, yeah.

614
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:45,720
 There's a place in Texas, Brackets, not

615
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:47,720
 Houston.

616
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:49,720
 Houston. Houston.

617
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:51,720
 I've gotten in trouble about that before.

618
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:53,720
 That's why you've written up, I reckon.

619
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:55,720
 It's like Zebra. I just don't know Zebra.

620
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:57,720
 I don't know how to say it anymore.

621
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:59,720
 It's the first time, then.

622
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:01,720
 I can't remember what I said.

623
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:03,720
 I say Zebra. You should, in theory,

624
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:05,720
 say Zebra for your accent.

625
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:07,720
 It's one of the, I'm so frightened

626
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:09,720
 and confused of these words now, I just don't say them anymore.

627
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:11,720
 Anyway, there's a place in Texas.

628
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:13,720
 Texas. Outside Houston.

629
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:15,720
 Yep.

630
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:17,720
 That do a Valhalla death sausage.

631
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:19,720
 And I was wondering if you could perhaps do a taste of it

632
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:21,720
 for me.

633
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:23,720
 I think Andy's Sausage Podcast

634
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:25,720
 is

635
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:27,720
 ready, isn't it?

636
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:29,720
 I think that would be a banger.

637
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:31,720
 Oh, no.

638
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:33,720
 Is that the name of it?

639
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:35,720
 Bangers.

640
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:37,720
 Andy's Sausage Party.

641
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:39,720
 There we go.

642
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:41,720
 Sausage Party has been used, unfortunately.

643
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:43,720
 I know, but for a different format.

644
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:45,720
 Medium.

645
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:47,720
 Jill Goodfellow writes about

646
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:49,720
 Spanker.

647
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:51,720
 Loved your last podcast.

648
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:53,720
 This was the election one we did.

649
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:55,720
 But having worked pretty well on all the elections

650
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:57,720
 of all types over the last 30 years

651
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:59,720
 in our packages of kit from shore and sun,

652
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:01,720
 which was the company we talked about,

653
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:03,720
 we have never been supplied with a Spanker.

654
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:05,720
 Really?

655
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:07,720
 I think we've been shortchanged.

656
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:09,720
 On rare occasions that we have a full box,

657
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:11,720
 we have to resort to the shore supplied ruler

658
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:13,720
 to tamp the papers down.

659
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:15,720
 Jill, you fool.

660
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:17,720
 It's...

661
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:23,720
 It's a plastic ruler that they provide you

662
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:25,720
 to push the safest out.

663
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:27,720
 Poor Jill.

664
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:29,720
 Where's the Spanker?

665
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:31,720
 There are a lot of rulers in the corner

666
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:33,720
 for every year.

667
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:35,720
 Oh, she must have been so excited

668
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:37,720
 if she was listening to this episode.

669
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:39,720
 Andy's brought up my email.

670
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:41,720
 Jill, you fucking moron.

671
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:43,720
 I didn't say that.

672
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:45,720
 I gently and politely said, "You fool."

673
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:47,720
 That's very funny.

674
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:49,720
 And she's a poll clerk.

675
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:51,720
 She's keeping democracy together here.

676
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:53,720
 Oh, God, and we respect her.

677
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:55,720
 We do. Thank you, Jill, for your service.

678
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:57,720
 There's another email here

679
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:59,720
 which does come with a photo from Dana May Gaynor.

680
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:01,720
 What a great name.

681
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:03,720
 Sorry, Dana May Gaynor.

682
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:05,720
 Dana May Gaynor.

683
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:07,720
 I thoroughly enjoyed your recent show,

684
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:09,720
 but I regret to inform you there is such a thing

685
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:11,720
 as sausage cats.

686
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:13,720
 The breed is called munchkin,

687
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:15,720
 and these cats have extremely short legs

688
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:17,720
 on a normal cat body, so they're much longer

689
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:19,720
 than they are tall. See here.

690
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:21,720
 Oh, yeah.

691
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:23,720
 She's included a picture of quite a long cat

692
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:25,720
 with short legs. Fair enough.

693
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:27,720
 She actually looks a bit like my cat,

694
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:29,720
 but if you took the middle bit

695
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:31,720
 of another cat and then sort of

696
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:33,720
 spliced it in.

697
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:35,720
 Like how they make cruise ships bigger.

698
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:37,720
 Exactly, yeah.

699
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:39,720
 Nice. Anyway, great email.

700
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:41,720
 Dana May. Good to know.

701
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:43,720
 Nice to see the cat.

702
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:45,720
 Bye.

703
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:51,720
 No, thank you for listening, everyone.

704
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:53,720
 That was Drop of the Line, another month over.

705
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:55,720
 I've just realised, by the way,

706
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:57,720
 that I think the word we've invented boffin

707
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:59,720
 might be the only word in the English language

708
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:01,720
 with a quadruple F,

709
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:03,720
 because I've just remembered the boff has a triple F.

710
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:05,720
 I think it's big old fecund female fish,

711
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:07,720
 and then we need to have fin.

712
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:09,720
 We need to have fin.

713
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:11,720
 So that's boffin.

714
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:13,720
 Quadruple F. Isn't that cool?

715
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:15,720
 What a great last thought to crowbar in

716
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:17,720
 as we do the outro. Thank you, Anna.

717
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:19,720
 As we get to the fin.

718
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:21,720
 Wow.

719
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:23,720
 But if you've enjoyed this kind of

720
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:25,720
 razor sharp rep RT

721
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:27,720
 and you want more of it, you just have to wait

722
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:29,720
 a month and remain a member of Club Fish.

723
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:31,720
 You don't need to do anything, actually.

724
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:33,720
 But do write in if you've been affected

725
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:35,720
 by any of the issues raised in this programme.

726
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:37,720
 We're here for it.

727
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:39,720
 Podcast@QI.com. Please do keep writing in

728
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:41,720
 unless it's about a mistake we've made

729
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,720
 or unless it's about, I can't believe it's not butter

730
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:45,720
 because I think that's just closed that box now.

731
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:47,720
 Thanks very much. See you next time.

732
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:49,720
 Bye.
