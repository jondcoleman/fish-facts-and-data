00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.160
 (phone ringing)

00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:05.740
 (upbeat music)

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:12.320
 - Hi, welcome to Drop As Aligned.

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:14.560
 This is the audience feedback show

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:17.500
 where we go through your emails,

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:18.660
 which I've been reading

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.720
 and these guys haven't seen them at all.

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:22.040
 - Emails that you've sent us,

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:23.440
 Andy hasn't been going through your emails.

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:25.280
 - I've been going through your emails.

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:26.120
 (laughs)

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:28.160
 And you should be ashamed of yourself actually.

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:29.800
 - You're not gonna get ExpressVPN.

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:34.800
 - We, we've given you every chance.

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:35.680
 - All right, here we go.

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:37.280
 Let's start with some spicy meat.

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:38.120
 - Oh, great.

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:40.680
 - From Ian, Dear Fishers and Elves.

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.960
 Bob Anderson was mentioned in a recent episode.

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:43.840
 - The Darts player.

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:45.240
 - The swordsman.

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:46.080
 - Okay.

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:47.760
 - I don't mean with the ladies.

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:48.600
 I mean--

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.120
 - The Darth Vader he played.

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:52.120
 - Yes, the choreographer of sword fighting.

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:54.920
 Who was an Olympic sword champion?

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:55.960
 This is an episode you missed, Dan.

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:56.800
 - He was a fencer.

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:57.920
 - Yeah, he was a fencer, that's right.

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:59.360
 And he played Darth Vader.

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:01.440
 - He did the physical fights for Darth Vader.

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.080
 - So David Prowse was Darth Vader in the normal scenes.

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.800
 - Exactly, I was in the third person to play Vader.

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:08.640
 - Did not know that.

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:09.480
 - There we go.

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:10.320
 Bob Anderson was mentioned.

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:11.240
 You might like to know this.

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:13.920
 When talking to Bob after a saber coaching seminar

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.000
 decades ago.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.000
 - Saber coach.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:16.840
 - Pretty cool.

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:19.120
 I asked him, who was the most talented swordsman

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:21.120
 or woman he'd worked with in Hollywood?

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:23.360
 He had no doubt, Madonna.

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:25.040
 - Sorry.

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:27.320
 - Was that for the Bond music clip?

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:28.160
 - Yes.

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:29.920
 - She was a single, she did with lots of,

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:31.920
 she had lots of die another day.

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.800
 - Yeah, she did a, and she did the single,

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:35.360
 the music video I think with her fencing as well.

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:36.200
 - Yeah.

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:37.720
 - Absolute natural fencer apparently.

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:40.920
 - I have fenced and it is probably,

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.680
 of all the spots that I've tried,

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:45.440
 the next morning I struggled most to get out of bed.

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:46.280
 - Really?

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:47.120
 - Yeah.

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.960
 - How interesting.

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:49.120
 - Cause it really stretches muscles

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:50.760
 that you're not really used to stretching.

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:51.600
 - Yeah.

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.200
 - They groin quite a lot of those groin muscles.

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:55.440
 - Did some fencing.

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:56.280
 - Yeah.

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:57.680
 - Yeah, but I didn't experience that,

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:59.840
 but that's because I was eight years old

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:00.680
 at the time I was doing it.

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:01.520
 - Yeah.

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:02.340
 - Right, yes.

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:03.180
 - That'll help.

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:04.560
 - But you know, it was fun.

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.000
 - Like a virgin?

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.840
 - Ah, well at the time, yeah.

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:10.520
 And for some time afterwards actually.

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:13.080
 But that's an incredible, that's great.

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.080
 Here's one from Peter Dixon.

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:17.040
 Recently Anna, I believe, introduced a fact

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.000
 about the speed of effluent during its travels

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.760
 along sewers being walking pace.

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.760
 - Oh yes, I think I was off for this one.

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:23.800
 - Ah, okay.

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:25.720
 My brain playing snap fact,

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:27.560
 immediately responded with the fact

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:31.160
 put forward by E.B. White, the great naturalist,

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:33.160
 who noted based on years of records

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:35.360
 that spring traveled north at walking pace

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:36.700
 in the British Isles.

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:37.540
 - That's true.

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:39.520
 - Are there other things that move at walking pace?

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:40.360
 - Oh my gosh.

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:42.680
 - Well firstly, E.B. White,

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:45.480
 I wouldn't have said naturalist as his opening thing.

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.080
 Author of Charlotte's Web,

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:50.280
 author of one of the handbooks for writing.

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:51.320
 - The one who wrote that guy.

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:52.160
 - But it was a naturalist.

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:53.000
 - He did write about nature.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.280
 I think he wrote a lot about nature

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:55.120
 and he loved living in a cell.

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:55.940
 - I think we did him on the show, didn't we?

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:56.780
 - We did.

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:57.620
 - We did section on him, yeah.

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:00.040
 - I mean, what's Charlotte's Web about if not nature?

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:03.160
 What is a spider if not a piece of the natural world?

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:05.040
 - It's about a talking pig.

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:08.120
 (all laughing)

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:10.760
 - That is a great part of the super natural world.

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:12.480
 (all laughing)

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:15.400
 - Yeah, so I mean other things that move at walking pace,

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:16.400
 challenge.

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:17.640
 - Like future shoes.

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:18.760
 - When they're walking.

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:20.360
 - He said humans are disqualified,

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:23.640
 rules out what Tyler, Mao Zedong, Nelson Mandela, et cetera.

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:25.320
 (all laughing)

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:26.520
 - That's a very funny joke.

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:28.420
 - Classic humans.

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:30.040
 - Oh, because the long walk to freedom.

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:30.880
 - Exactly, yeah.

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:32.120
 - And Mao Zedong's long march.

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:32.960
 - Yeah.

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:33.780
 - Sorry, that's, no, that's good.

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:34.620
 That's how I've read that.

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:35.460
 I didn't get that.

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:37.120
 - And what Tyler's presence revolved,

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:38.600
 which I guess was mostly done on foot.

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:39.960
 - Hmm.

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:42.720
 - Okay, so what other things move at the speed

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:43.840
 of a human walking?

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:45.080
 - We can leave it be for the moment

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:47.400
 and we can come back to it if you guys think of it.

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:48.560
 - Shrieker, is this like homework?

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:50.520
 Next time, I'll come back with some answers.

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:51.360
 - I'm just gonna write homework.

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:56.360
 - The speed of waves rolling onto a sandy beach.

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:57.200
 Lovely.

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:58.320
 - They're usually quite a bit fast.

00:03:58.320 --> 00:03:59.680
 They're usually a lot faster than that.

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:01.000
 - Oh, no, they could be about that.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.160
 - It's very gentle.

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:04.800
 - Yeah, what happens is you walk along the beach

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:06.160
 and then a wave comes along

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:08.160
 and you have to jog out of the way of it, don't you?

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:09.600
 So it's slightly more than a walk.

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:11.000
 - Yes, you're right, that's a jog.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.160
 Yes, okay, but good.

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:13.760
 We've eliminated the ocean.

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:14.600
 That's good.

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:15.440
 (all laughing)

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:16.560
 When I got this email from Peter,

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:18.440
 my mind immediately went to,

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:19.280
 are you fingering at us?

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:22.360
 - No, I go, "Walk, I said it, actually they don't."

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:24.320
 - Your fingernails move at the same pace

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:26.400
 as the Earth's tectonic plates.

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:28.240
 - That's what I was thinking of.

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:29.960
 It's different, yeah.

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:30.800
 Well, let's move on,

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:32.160
 and we can come back to a walking pace thing.

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:35.000
 - I seem to remember on one of the planets,

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.560
 I wanna say it's Mars, but it could be Venus,

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:40.040
 that the sunset moves approximately at that pace.

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:42.640
 You can walk and like have a forever sunset.

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:43.840
 - You're so right.

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:44.680
 - That's great.

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:45.520
 - We mentioned that recently.

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:46.360
 - It is romantic.

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:48.600
 - I think it's one of the nearest to the sun planets.

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:50.640
 - I'm gonna say Venus.

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:52.240
 - Yeah, well, it's either that or Mercury.

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:53.280
 - Mercury, I'm gonna say Mercury.

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:54.120
 Final answer.

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:56.000
 - Anyway, it's very romantic is my point.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:56.960
 That's really, that's lovely.

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:57.800
 - That's lovely.

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:59.360
 - Oh, shadows.

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:02.400
 - Oh, that's good, unless you're running.

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:05.440
 (all laughing)

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:06.920
 - Here's one from Aaron.

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:07.920
 In a recent episode,

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:10.760
 Anna said leeches were kept as pets in the past

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:12.480
 as a leech keeper myself.

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:18.160
 I can say leeches are definitely still kept as pets today.

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:19.000
 - Great correction.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.840
 - So many people,

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:22.880
 the number of times I've gone into the park

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:26.280
 and people are dragging the pet leash on a leech.

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:27.320
 Leech on a leash.

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:31.520
 - Yeah, it can't move a leech food in the pet shop.

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:33.080
 (all laughing)

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:34.240
 Sorry, Aaron, you're right.

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:37.800
 It's got a very common thing to do and I take it back.

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:39.440
 - That's so funny.

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:41.760
 Pretty much anything we could say on this podcast,

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:44.760
 it'll be like, "Oh, do you know that they used to have bars?"

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:47.400
 Some of them write it going, "What do you mean, used to?"

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:49.480
 (all laughing)

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:51.600
 Here's one from Alex Bailey.

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:54.120
 On Drop As A Line in October, 2023.

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:54.960
 All right.

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:58.760
 You were puzzled by a listener who wrote in saying,

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:00.920
 "You once claimed the Buddhist monks

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:02.600
 drink through their penises."

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:03.440
 - Oh, yeah.

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:05.120
 (all laughing)

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:07.360
 - I listened to the relevant app the other day

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:08.560
 and though I can't tell you the number,

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:10.080
 I can confidently say,

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:10.920
 - Oh, God.

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:12.360
 - Sorry, this is a bit blue, this one.

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:14.280
 It was about them sucking their semen back in

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:17.400
 so as not to waste their life force playing jack-in-lating.

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:18.920
 - Yes.

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:21.080
 - And it's the speed of which they suck it back in,

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:22.600
 as I say, there's a walkie-talkie here.

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:24.480
 (all laughing)

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:26.400
 - There's another bit of the email saying,

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:27.240
 the second thing is,

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:28.840
 "I lived in Melbourne for many years

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:30.960
 and the arpeggio at the start of Wasps

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:33.080
 sounds uncannily like the ones that used to play

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:35.640
 before the announcement at Flinders Street Station."

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:36.480
 - Okay.

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:38.000
 - ♪ Do, do, do, do, do ♪

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:38.840
 - Yeah.

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:39.680
 - That bit.

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:40.520
 - Interesting.

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:45.520
 - It is interesting because the man who wrote that song

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:47.280
 lived in Australia for a while.

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:48.400
 - Yeah.

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:49.640
 - Maybe that's where he got it.

00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:51.320
 - So is that part of it?

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:52.640
 Is that plagiarism?

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:54.600
 (all laughing)

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:56.600
 - I don't know, but if that was the case,

00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:59.200
 that would be the second song that I know of

00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:03.640
 that samples street sound from a,

00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:06.440
 so Billie Eilish's "Bad Guy."

00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:08.560
 She samples when you press an Australia

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:09.400
 to go across the road

00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:16.100
 it makes the noises they sampled that and that's that's part of the drum beat of bad guy. That's good. So that would make it too.

00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:24.260
 Trying to put in that buzzing noise that your phone makes a vibrating noise because there are some songs I listen to and every point of the song I think, oh, I've got a text. I get that as well.

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:33.460
 I think it's probably a coincidence. I think because there are a few tracks that I listen to that that happens. It's annoying, isn't it? Yeah, it's really annoying.

00:07:33.460 --> 00:07:45.400
 That's my phone only ever goes. No songs ever have that. Well, that is actually that's a song, isn't it? That's an old Spanish classical song.

00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:55.720
 What's this? Yes, here's one from Adam Rodriguez. On July's episode of Drop As A Line, Andy suggested Old Fish as a name for a segment where people dredge things up from bygone eras.

00:07:55.720 --> 00:08:05.720
 I humbly suggest that you instead name it after one of America's first business tycoons, Preserved Fish. Oh, yeah, I remember him. What did he do?

00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:14.720
 He was one of America's first business tycoons. It's at a Bible name when they just used to name themselves by opening the Bible at random, putting their finger down.

00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:25.720
 Great name to preserve it. I'm not convinced that he didn't work in some kind of seafood industry as well, trying to remember him. No, isn't that Captain Birdseye?

00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:35.720
 Yeah, I remember Preserved Fish, but I can't remember the context. It does seem like maybe we'd remember him because we made it a QI fact that he worked in a fish industry.

00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:44.720
 But maybe just because it's a funny name. And I can imagine Preserved being a biblical name. God has Preserved you.

00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:56.720
 Ellie Miller of Austin, Texas writes, listening to Dan say the word Australia at the end of episode 538, brackets to rhyme with failure, which I know is normal, but different from the American pronunciation.

00:08:56.720 --> 00:09:13.720
 Australia. It reminded me of the first ever English language poetry published in Australia. It was by an Englishman barrister named Baron Field, who was a friend of Charles Lamb, who's quite famous, and wrote a 12 page volume of verse in 1819.

00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:29.720
 And here, just here a few of the lines from it, kangaroo, kangaroo, thou spirit of Australia, that redeems from utter failure and perfect desolation, and warrants the creation of this fifth part of the earth, which would seem an after birth, not conceived in the beginning.

00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:38.720
 For God blessed his work at first and saw that it was good, but emerged at the first sinning when the ground was therefore cursed, and hence this barren wood.

00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:49.720
 That's great. That should be the National Anthem. Can you imagine the National Anthem for Australia when they start up going, kangaroo, oh, kangaroo.

00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:55.720
 So thank you for that, Ellie. It's great. Here's an expert voice. This is brilliant.

00:09:55.720 --> 00:10:02.720
 We have a name for that. Dave. No, we don't have a name for that. We should have a sort of sting.

00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:05.720
 Like a, what would you call them, a boffin?

00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:15.720
 Yeah, boffin corner. We've got spicy meat. We've got old fish and now like boffin, boffin something. We'll work on it.

00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:27.720
 Oh, actually, I was going to say we need a fish theme, but isn't boff B-O-F-F is a very feckin female fish, I think.

00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:34.720
 And fins are what you find on a fish. There we go. It's called boff fins. Yeah, writing it down.

00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:40.720
 I think it's big old feckin female boff, and that's in terms of fish. Is that genuinely true?

00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:45.720
 I'm pretty sure. And then fins, as Dan says, are also fish related.

00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:53.720
 Wow, it's so nice to be there at the moment of creation. Boff fins. Unlike Australia, of course.

00:10:53.720 --> 00:11:03.720
 So this is great. On the subject, Dave Pearson says, hello. On the subject of unexploded bombs, I work as a freelance hydrographical survey consultant

00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:10.720
 to take work playing "Find the Bombs" using radiometers, magnetometers and various sonars.

00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:16.720
 Building something offshore, like a wind farm or whatever. And he says, I can tell you there are unexploded bombs all over the place.

00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:25.720
 Do you remember we discussed that one that was in the wash, is it? Or in the Thames? And it's like a huge bomb there.

00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:30.720
 And one day it might go off and it just blasts the entire south of England.

00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:36.720
 That sheds a tsunami towards us. And people go out and keep putting things near it.

00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:45.720
 It is off the coast of Lincoln somewhere, I think. Not in the wash. Like someone's put it in the wash. Don't put your bombs in the wash.

00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:51.720
 But the reason there are so many is not because of what was dropped in anger. It was if a bomber had to turn back or failed to drop the payload,

00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:57.720
 they would have to dump their bombs. And so they did that out of the sea, because the sea is there.

00:11:57.720 --> 00:12:02.720
 So yeah, and he says, for what it's worth, I wouldn't go near them in a tank either. We don't tend to disturb them.

00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:07.720
 It's just better to spend a bit extra rerouting cables. And then you just move the cables a bit and fine.

00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:15.720
 Yeah, amazing. Dave from Oakland, California says, the discussion about drovers and herring lasses,

00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:20.720
 knitting as they made their respective journeys across the country, was pretty cute.

00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:24.720
 It got me thinking about that as a theme for a folk song in the style of the Decemberists.

00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:31.720
 I'm not very musically talented, but with the current AI boom, it is pretty trivial to prompt a machine to fill in where talents fail.

00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:37.720
 And he's attached a song, a lyrics song and lyrics.

00:12:37.720 --> 00:12:41.720
 And it's the lyrics are thread of fate. It's the name of the song.

00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:42.720
 Okay.

00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:44.720
 Shall I read you the first verse also?

00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:45.720
 Yeah.

00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:51.720
 "Drover walks alone in the dawn." Remember, this has come up with AI, so we can be rude about it. That's fine.

00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:59.720
 "Drover walks alone in the dawn. Herring lass with nets so worn. On the road they meet by chance. Wondering gaze, a fleeting glance.

00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:09.720
 Thread of yarn between their hands. Tie them close across the lands. Winter's chill and summer's heat. In their hearts the yarn will beat."

00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:11.720
 And there are several more verses.

00:13:11.720 --> 00:13:12.720
 I like it.

00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:13.720
 That's fine.

00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:14.720
 I'd buy that.

00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:15.720
 Pretty good.

00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:21.720
 Is that in the December, the Russian nobles who rose up against the Tsar in the early 19th century?

00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:23.720
 Yep, that's right.

00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:24.720
 That's right.

00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:28.720
 There's a controversial thing here from Sherry Bluebond.

00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:35.720
 I was listening to your July 22, I don't know if that's July 2022.

00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:37.720
 On the 22nd of July.

00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:38.720
 Probably that.

00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:43.720
 "Drop as a lion episode. And you folks seem surprised that people in Canada can still buy, I can't believe it's not better."

00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:46.720
 James, I think this was something you said, I'm so sorry.

00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:49.720
 Honestly, I think this is what I've had the most correspondence with.

00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:54.720
 We've had a lot of people saying you can buy it in England, you can buy it here, you can buy it there, you can buy it everywhere.

00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:55.720
 You buy it in England?

00:13:55.720 --> 00:13:56.720
 Apparently, yeah.

00:13:56.720 --> 00:13:58.720
 I can't believe it.

00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:03.720
 So why did we think it had gone out of production?

00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:07.720
 I think you have to go to a very specialist place to get it in England.

00:14:07.720 --> 00:14:08.720
 Do you? It's not in Tokyo.

00:14:08.720 --> 00:14:13.720
 There was someone saying I was on Piccadilly's circus, there was an entire stand of ot... I don't know.

00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:15.720
 But look, this is the only reason I mentioned this.

00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:16.720
 Yeah.

00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:21.720
 It's because she's attached a photo, Sherry, of a bottle of squirty, I can't believe it's not butter.

00:14:21.720 --> 00:14:24.720
 Yeah, that looks like a disinfectant kind of thing.

00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:27.720
 But weirdly, that is sort of liquid.

00:14:27.720 --> 00:14:30.720
 That makes it easier for me to believe that it isn't butter.

00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:31.720
 Yes, Sherry.

00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:32.720
 You know what I mean?

00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:34.720
 Ah, but that's working against the titans.

00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:36.720
 Exactly, I can't believe that's not butter.

00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:37.720
 Yeah, have a look.

00:14:37.720 --> 00:14:38.720
 Of course.

00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:41.720
 Yeah, I can't believe it's not washing up liquid.

00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:43.720
 Yeah, she's in LA.

00:14:43.720 --> 00:14:44.720
 Oh, yeah.

00:14:44.720 --> 00:14:47.720
 Well, they have all sorts of LA, don't they?

00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:49.720
 I think it is on sale in the UK, though, James.

00:14:49.720 --> 00:14:51.720
 I never thought it had gone on sale.

00:14:51.720 --> 00:14:53.720
 I don't know how many censors was that.

00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:55.720
 They've got all sorts of LA.

00:14:55.720 --> 00:14:56.720
 I'm just looking.

00:14:56.720 --> 00:14:58.720
 It's before days.

00:14:58.720 --> 00:15:01.720
 I just can't quite see it.

00:15:01.720 --> 00:15:04.720
 Your one-man campaign against the existence of this product.

00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:07.720
 It still exists.

00:15:07.720 --> 00:15:09.720
 If anyone comes on tour and gives me a tub,

00:15:09.720 --> 00:15:11.720
 if I can't believe it's not butter,

00:15:11.720 --> 00:15:13.720
 I'll send them a badge.

00:15:13.720 --> 00:15:17.720
 Only the first person to do it.

00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:18.720
 Oh, that's great.

00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:20.720
 Anyway, yeah, sorry about that.

00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:23.720
 This is a great one from Nathan Dwyer.

00:15:23.720 --> 00:15:25.720
 I think this is another boffin.

00:15:25.720 --> 00:15:27.720
 I've listened to the show since 2021

00:15:27.720 --> 00:15:30.720
 for 200 hours plus on Spotify each year.

00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:32.720
 And I can't thank you all enough for the nearly

00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:34.720
 800 hours of entertainment and learning and fun.

00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:35.720
 It's very nice.

00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:37.720
 My favourite factory tell is the man who set off

00:15:37.720 --> 00:15:39.720
 on a 38-day trip across Antarctica,

00:15:39.720 --> 00:15:41.720
 who only packed one pair of underwear

00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:44.720
 and shared himself on Day 16.

00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:46.720
 It's a great fact.

00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:48.720
 I don't remember that.

00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:49.720
 Yeah, I remember that.

00:15:49.720 --> 00:15:51.720
 Because he wanted to make room for all the weird snacks

00:15:51.720 --> 00:15:53.720
 he had, didn't he?

00:15:53.720 --> 00:15:55.720
 He was saving space.

00:15:55.720 --> 00:15:57.720
 Was he the one who had all the energy bars?

00:15:57.720 --> 00:15:58.720
 Yes.

00:15:58.720 --> 00:16:00.720
 I think they're called Colin bars or something.

00:16:00.720 --> 00:16:03.720
 And he had them all in the second day.

00:16:03.720 --> 00:16:05.720
 And that's why he shot himself, wasn't it?

00:16:05.720 --> 00:16:07.720
 He lost all self-control.

00:16:07.720 --> 00:16:10.720
 Anyway, however,

00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:12.720
 I think the quote that I've retold the most,

00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:14.720
 this is interesting, was Dan's line,

00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:18.720
 "It's not only happy that dogs wag their tails when they are."

00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:20.720
 OK?

00:16:20.720 --> 00:16:22.720
 Now, Nathan says...

00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:25.720
 Maybe that was a bad edit.

00:16:25.720 --> 00:16:27.720
 Nathan Dwyer says,

00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:31.720
 "I'm a linguistics PhD student studying syntax."

00:16:31.720 --> 00:16:33.720
 And this is a perfect example

00:16:33.720 --> 00:16:37.720
 of what's called an island violation in syntax.

00:16:37.720 --> 00:16:39.720
 Basically, you're not supposed to be able to move happy

00:16:39.720 --> 00:16:41.720
 to the front like this in order to focus on the word happy

00:16:41.720 --> 00:16:43.720
 because it originates in a relative clause

00:16:43.720 --> 00:16:45.720
 that it cannot be extracted out of. OK.

00:16:45.720 --> 00:16:47.720
 Can you say the sentence first again?

00:16:47.720 --> 00:16:51.720
 "It's not only happy that dogs wag their tails when they are."

00:16:51.720 --> 00:16:56.720
 That actually works for me now that you're in here.

00:16:57.720 --> 00:17:00.720
 Dan, you do speak a little bit like that,

00:17:00.720 --> 00:17:02.720
 but that's fine because that's just the way you are,

00:17:02.720 --> 00:17:05.720
 but usually I've changed the sentences around.

00:17:05.720 --> 00:17:07.720
 Yeah, but that's...

00:17:07.720 --> 00:17:10.720
 I don't know if that's my having learnt Mandarin as a kid as well,

00:17:10.720 --> 00:17:12.720
 West Central Structure is in different spots.

00:17:12.720 --> 00:17:14.720
 Maybe, though.

00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:16.720
 He says, "I'd love to publish a paper someday documenting island violations

00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:19.720
 in naturalistic speech, and this example would be front and centre."

00:17:19.720 --> 00:17:21.720
 Great. Yeah.

00:17:21.720 --> 00:17:23.720
 That's really interesting because that poem about Australia

00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:25.720
 was a bit of an island violation.

00:17:25.720 --> 00:17:27.720
 Yes.

00:17:27.720 --> 00:17:29.720
 Superb.

00:17:29.720 --> 00:17:31.720
 Hamish Duckmantan.

00:17:31.720 --> 00:17:33.720
 Brilliant name.

00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:35.720
 Hamish Duckmantan.

00:17:35.720 --> 00:17:37.720
 Duckmantan.

00:17:37.720 --> 00:17:39.720
 Yeah, beautiful.

00:17:39.720 --> 00:17:41.720
 "I'm a volunteer firefighter from Victoria, Australia."

00:17:41.720 --> 00:17:43.720
 Yay.

00:17:43.720 --> 00:17:45.720
 "And I thought I'd add to your firefighter facts.

00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:47.720
 In Victoria, we can fill our fire trucks from any water source, including pools."

00:17:47.720 --> 00:17:49.720
 Cool.

00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:51.720
 "And they have a lot of fires and areas away from water mains,

00:17:51.720 --> 00:17:53.720
 so they do need to."

00:17:53.720 --> 00:17:55.720
 "And they're just repeating the facts that we said."

00:17:55.720 --> 00:17:57.720
 You know what I mean.

00:17:57.720 --> 00:17:59.720
 I'm afraid that was almost verbatim

00:17:59.720 --> 00:18:01.720
 what Anna said on the day.

00:18:01.720 --> 00:18:03.720
 Okay, here we go. Here's a bet. Well, he goes on.

00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:05.720
 Yes.

00:18:05.720 --> 00:18:07.720
 "We also use quite a lot of helicopters because of our large bushfires.

00:18:07.720 --> 00:18:09.720
 One type is an Erickson Sky Crane,

00:18:09.720 --> 00:18:11.720
 which can carry 9,000 litres

00:18:11.720 --> 00:18:13.720
 and suck it up in its snorkel in about a minute.

00:18:13.720 --> 00:18:15.720
 Okay?

00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:17.720
 But if it has a long lake available,

00:18:17.720 --> 00:18:19.720
 it can put down a hard snorkel,

00:18:19.720 --> 00:18:21.720
 skim across the surface

00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:23.720
 and suck the water up in half the time."

00:18:23.720 --> 00:18:25.720
 Lovely.

00:18:25.720 --> 00:18:27.720
 A hard snorkel.

00:18:27.720 --> 00:18:29.720
 It sounds filthy. I'm going to put down a hard snorkel.

00:18:29.720 --> 00:18:31.720
 Give me a hard snorkel.

00:18:31.720 --> 00:18:33.720
 "You scoop up into your snorkel by just popping it down

00:18:33.720 --> 00:18:35.720
 and then pushing it along the surface of the water."

00:18:35.720 --> 00:18:37.720
 Right.

00:18:37.720 --> 00:18:39.720
 Okay, like a dust pan and brush kind of maneuver.

00:18:39.720 --> 00:18:41.720
 Pretty good.

00:18:41.720 --> 00:18:43.720
 No, that is cool and thank you for the work that you do.

00:18:43.720 --> 00:18:45.720
 Mr Duck Mountain or whatever you're...

00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:47.720
 Can you go...

00:18:47.720 --> 00:18:49.720
 Long night on the Duck Mountain.

00:18:49.720 --> 00:18:51.720
 Yeah.

00:18:51.720 --> 00:18:53.720
 Arthur Purvis writes,

00:18:53.720 --> 00:18:55.720
 "I love your podcast.

00:18:55.720 --> 00:18:57.720
 Your facts are so interesting

00:18:57.720 --> 00:18:59.720
 and you always make me laugh in some way or another

00:18:59.720 --> 00:19:01.720
 like an observation with trams.

00:19:01.720 --> 00:19:03.720
 Did you know that after..."

00:19:03.720 --> 00:19:05.720
 This is relevant, actually, and I thought of this.

00:19:05.720 --> 00:19:07.720
 I wondered if you guys think of the same thing.

00:19:07.720 --> 00:19:09.720
 Did you know that after Donald Trump was shot in the ear

00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:11.720
 in the summer of 2024,

00:19:11.720 --> 00:19:13.720
 many of his supporters bandaged their own ears

00:19:13.720 --> 00:19:15.720
 in recognition of his injury?"

00:19:15.720 --> 00:19:17.720
 Yes.

00:19:17.720 --> 00:19:19.720
 And with a limp who got her limp impersonated.

00:19:19.720 --> 00:19:21.720
 Princess Alexandra or something.

00:19:21.720 --> 00:19:23.720
 Dan Martin.

00:19:23.720 --> 00:19:25.720
 She had a limp and people in the court started,

00:19:25.720 --> 00:19:27.720
 "Okay, it made me think of

00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:29.720
 Louis XIV's anal fistula."

00:19:29.720 --> 00:19:31.720
 Yes.

00:19:31.720 --> 00:19:33.720
 Remember? Because he had a thing in his bottom

00:19:33.720 --> 00:19:35.720
 and a lot of people in the court

00:19:35.720 --> 00:19:37.720
 after he had the operation wore bandages

00:19:37.720 --> 00:19:39.720
 because it became fashionable.

00:19:39.720 --> 00:19:41.720
 And they walked around with bandages on their bums.

00:19:41.720 --> 00:19:43.720
 Yes, it's the same thing.

00:19:43.720 --> 00:19:45.720
 That is so interesting, isn't it?

00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:47.720
 They're a good company.

00:19:47.720 --> 00:19:49.720
 Big complaint for something I think that I said.

00:19:49.720 --> 00:19:51.720
 Uh-oh.

00:19:51.720 --> 00:19:53.720
 Dun, dun, dun.

00:19:53.720 --> 00:19:55.720
 It's had a couple of complaints on it.

00:19:55.720 --> 00:19:59.720
 John G. Erickson.

00:19:59.720 --> 00:20:01.720
 "I am an American with an electric kettle."

00:20:01.720 --> 00:20:03.720
 Because, yeah, this is going to be you.

00:20:03.720 --> 00:20:05.720
 "My mother and sister have electric kettles.

00:20:05.720 --> 00:20:07.720
 Lots of people in America have electric kettles."

00:20:07.720 --> 00:20:09.720
 None of us have ever seen "I Can't Believe It's Not Butter."

00:20:09.720 --> 00:20:11.720
 None of us have ever seen "I Can't Believe It's Not Butter."

00:20:11.720 --> 00:20:13.720
 None of us have ever seen "I Can't Believe It's Not Butter."

00:20:13.720 --> 00:20:15.720
 Your claim on this week's list that Americans

00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:17.720
 don't have them is just not true.

00:20:17.720 --> 00:20:19.720
 I might have claimed it. They have them far, far less.

00:20:19.720 --> 00:20:21.720
 Come on. Yeah, like, literally,

00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:23.720
 Americans, if you're listening to this

00:20:23.720 --> 00:20:25.720
 and I'm sure some of you are,

00:20:25.720 --> 00:20:27.720
 tell all your mates that we have them

00:20:27.720 --> 00:20:29.720
 in every single house.

00:20:29.720 --> 00:20:31.720
 In every room of the house.

00:20:31.720 --> 00:20:33.720
 Yeah, more than one kettle, most people.

00:20:33.720 --> 00:20:35.720
 We've got a thing in our house, by the way,

00:20:35.720 --> 00:20:37.720
 which is that Finella often buys

00:20:37.720 --> 00:20:39.720
 her kettles from Europe.

00:20:39.720 --> 00:20:41.720
 You see why I mean Americans?

00:20:41.720 --> 00:20:43.720
 Everyone in the house has their own kettles.

00:20:43.720 --> 00:20:45.720
 The biggest marry Antoine energy

00:20:45.720 --> 00:20:47.720
 I've ever heard.

00:20:47.720 --> 00:20:49.720
 So she gets her kettles from

00:20:49.720 --> 00:20:51.720
 Europe and...

00:20:51.720 --> 00:20:53.720
 They're fabricates, aren't they?

00:20:53.720 --> 00:20:55.720
 They keep breaking, right?

00:20:55.720 --> 00:20:57.720
 And I said to her, "Hun, why do you keep

00:20:57.720 --> 00:20:59.720
 buying kettles that break? It's a cat like,

00:20:59.720 --> 00:21:01.720
 how is this possible?" And she said,

00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:03.720
 "Stop buying first class, did you leave her?

00:21:03.720 --> 00:21:05.720
 You could have bought another one.

00:21:05.720 --> 00:21:07.720
 Or just buy two on the same flight, please."

00:21:07.720 --> 00:21:09.720
 So she says

00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:11.720
 that the reason they keep breaking,

00:21:11.720 --> 00:21:13.720
 she loves the style of the kettles that they have,

00:21:13.720 --> 00:21:15.720
 but they keep breaking because

00:21:15.720 --> 00:21:17.720
 no other country uses kettles

00:21:17.720 --> 00:21:19.720
 at the rate that the British do.

00:21:19.720 --> 00:21:21.720
 Therefore, ours are like built to survive.

00:21:21.720 --> 00:21:23.720
 Whereas, so her rate

00:21:23.720 --> 00:21:25.720
 of making tea, the kettle is just like,

00:21:25.720 --> 00:21:27.720
 this is too much and it...

00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:29.720
 You know what, I think she's absolutely right about that.

00:21:29.720 --> 00:21:31.720
 But it does, because she...

00:21:31.720 --> 00:21:33.720
 And it does make me think that now she's

00:21:33.720 --> 00:21:35.720
 realised that, why is she continuing

00:21:35.720 --> 00:21:37.720
 to buy the kettles? Oh, because they look great.

00:21:37.720 --> 00:21:39.720
 You know, it's fashion over...

00:21:39.720 --> 00:21:41.720
 What I would say to Fen,

00:21:41.720 --> 00:21:43.720
 and what I will say to her next time we see her,

00:21:43.720 --> 00:21:45.720
 is buy one for show

00:21:45.720 --> 00:21:47.720
 and then just have another little one underneath

00:21:47.720 --> 00:21:49.720
 the counter, a good old British one

00:21:49.720 --> 00:21:51.720
 that will do it quickly. And then

00:21:51.720 --> 00:21:53.720
 pour, it's like having a Hendricks

00:21:53.720 --> 00:21:55.720
 gin bottle that you

00:21:55.720 --> 00:21:57.720
 pour crap gin into. Yes.

00:21:57.720 --> 00:21:59.720
 All posh soap bottles, I've actually

00:21:59.720 --> 00:22:01.720
 done this, those e-soap soap,

00:22:01.720 --> 00:22:03.720
 just pour your Audi value.

00:22:03.720 --> 00:22:05.720
 So pour crap kettle, hot water into

00:22:05.720 --> 00:22:07.720
 the kettle and then bring that up

00:22:07.720 --> 00:22:09.720
 and say, I'll be using this one for your tea.

00:22:09.720 --> 00:22:11.720
 One

00:22:11.720 --> 00:22:13.720
 controversial thing can I just say about tea is that

00:22:13.720 --> 00:22:15.720
 I think it's better

00:22:15.720 --> 00:22:17.720
 to have it on a stove top. Now, I

00:22:17.720 --> 00:22:19.720
 don't, but I grew up because

00:22:19.720 --> 00:22:21.720
 of, you know, who I am,

00:22:21.720 --> 00:22:23.720
 in a family that had an aga for some portion

00:22:23.720 --> 00:22:25.720
 of my life. Yeah, okay,

00:22:25.720 --> 00:22:27.720
 get over it. And

00:22:27.720 --> 00:22:29.720
 so we'd boil the kettle on the aga

00:22:29.720 --> 00:22:31.720
 and that means that you don't, because

00:22:31.720 --> 00:22:33.720
 you know you mustn't make tea unless

00:22:33.720 --> 00:22:35.720
 the water is literally boiling. Right.

00:22:35.720 --> 00:22:37.720
 That's if you've read George Orwell's essay

00:22:37.720 --> 00:22:39.720
 on tea. So the only way to make tea is that

00:22:39.720 --> 00:22:41.720
 everyone gather around the aga

00:22:41.720 --> 00:22:43.720
 we're going to recharge our wells

00:22:43.720 --> 00:22:45.720
 on the aga tea. I did notice

00:22:45.720 --> 00:22:47.720
 you were the only one not giving me shit about

00:22:47.720 --> 00:22:49.720
 vanilla buying European kettles and that came out.

00:22:49.720 --> 00:22:51.720
 You will have an aga in every room.

00:22:51.720 --> 00:22:53.720
 Thank you.

00:22:53.720 --> 00:22:55.720
 Everyone's got a water related

00:22:55.720 --> 00:22:57.720
 poshness here. So Dan's wife buys

00:22:57.720 --> 00:22:59.720
 kettles in

00:22:59.720 --> 00:23:01.720
 my garden.

00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:03.720
 Anna only will have aga

00:23:03.720 --> 00:23:05.720
 and James' cat is

00:23:05.720 --> 00:23:07.720
 slurping up the heavy head. Yeah.

00:23:07.720 --> 00:23:09.720
 What's my, I must have, logically I must have

00:23:09.720 --> 00:23:11.720
 what you will have. We'll find it, we'll find it.

00:23:11.720 --> 00:23:13.720
 Anyway, the aga you don't have to rush so when the kettle

00:23:13.720 --> 00:23:15.720
 clicks, do you find yourselves doing that? You have

00:23:15.720 --> 00:23:17.720
 to sort of stay near the kettle all the time because you have

00:23:17.720 --> 00:23:19.720
 to rush to it to pour it on the tea.

00:23:19.720 --> 00:23:21.720
 I'm not as militant as you are. I think you're very

00:23:21.720 --> 00:23:23.720
 like, it has to be big bubbles

00:23:23.720 --> 00:23:25.720
 of water and I will sometimes wait 10 seconds.

00:23:25.720 --> 00:23:27.720
 See, I always got nervous making you tea. There's a thing

00:23:27.720 --> 00:23:29.720
 which I absolutely didn't take part in.

00:23:29.720 --> 00:23:31.720
 I feel like James, maybe you didn't as well

00:23:31.720 --> 00:23:33.720
 where on the wall of the QI office, there's like

00:23:33.720 --> 00:23:35.720
 a tea chart of how everyone's like,

00:23:35.720 --> 00:23:37.720
 "I need the bag in for this long, I need this kind of milk."

00:23:37.720 --> 00:23:39.720
 No, it was I like green tea.

00:23:39.720 --> 00:23:41.720
 What a great colleague you are that you deserve

00:23:41.720 --> 00:23:43.720
 so you refuse to acknowledge people's tea

00:23:43.720 --> 00:23:45.720
 preference because you've never made anyone tea down.

00:23:45.720 --> 00:23:47.720
 It's fun to make a cup of tea for anyone else's life. That is a lie.

00:23:47.720 --> 00:23:49.720
 Well, I make tea. You sent mine back

00:23:49.720 --> 00:23:51.720
 because you're like too milky. I guess I should have looked at the chart.

00:23:51.720 --> 00:23:53.720
 Well, it was nice to be in the podcast while

00:23:53.720 --> 00:23:55.720
 I lasted. And wasn't it

00:23:55.720 --> 00:23:57.720
 predictable that this is how it would end?

00:23:57.720 --> 00:24:01.720
 Just to drag it back to...

00:24:01.720 --> 00:24:03.720
 I'm sorry, Dan. You've made me tea in the past, I'm sure.

00:24:03.720 --> 00:24:05.720
 You should be glad in America you don't have kettles.

00:24:05.720 --> 00:24:07.720
 You don't have this kind of blowout.

00:24:07.720 --> 00:24:09.720
 Well, the last time we had a visitor in our home

00:24:09.720 --> 00:24:11.720
 from America recently

00:24:11.720 --> 00:24:13.720
 who came down early

00:24:13.720 --> 00:24:15.720
 in the morning, got the kettle,

00:24:15.720 --> 00:24:17.720
 filled it up with water, put it on the hob.

00:24:17.720 --> 00:24:19.720
 Oh.

00:24:19.720 --> 00:24:21.720
 Melted the kettle.

00:24:21.720 --> 00:24:23.720
 Housebone down.

00:24:23.720 --> 00:24:25.720
 Just sort of like this is just

00:24:25.720 --> 00:24:27.720
 like early morning, not really thinking straight yet.

00:24:27.720 --> 00:24:29.720
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:24:29.720 --> 00:24:31.720
 Chris Diver.

00:24:31.720 --> 00:24:33.720
 I finally subscribed to Club Fish.

00:24:33.720 --> 00:24:35.720
 Sorry about this, Chris.

00:24:35.720 --> 00:24:37.720
 Andy keeps mentioning spicy meat.

00:24:37.720 --> 00:24:39.720
 And I looked online to try and find

00:24:39.720 --> 00:24:41.720
 what the spiciest meat is.

00:24:41.720 --> 00:24:43.720
 Oh, yeah.

00:24:43.720 --> 00:24:45.720
 There's a place in Texas, Brackets, not

00:24:45.720 --> 00:24:47.720
 Houston.

00:24:47.720 --> 00:24:49.720
 Houston. Houston.

00:24:49.720 --> 00:24:51.720
 I've gotten in trouble about that before.

00:24:51.720 --> 00:24:53.720
 That's why you've written up, I reckon.

00:24:53.720 --> 00:24:55.720
 It's like Zebra. I just don't know Zebra.

00:24:55.720 --> 00:24:57.720
 I don't know how to say it anymore.

00:24:57.720 --> 00:24:59.720
 It's the first time, then.

00:24:59.720 --> 00:25:01.720
 I can't remember what I said.

00:25:01.720 --> 00:25:03.720
 I say Zebra. You should, in theory,

00:25:03.720 --> 00:25:05.720
 say Zebra for your accent.

00:25:05.720 --> 00:25:07.720
 It's one of the, I'm so frightened

00:25:07.720 --> 00:25:09.720
 and confused of these words now, I just don't say them anymore.

00:25:09.720 --> 00:25:11.720
 Anyway, there's a place in Texas.

00:25:11.720 --> 00:25:13.720
 Texas. Outside Houston.

00:25:13.720 --> 00:25:15.720
 Yep.

00:25:15.720 --> 00:25:17.720
 That do a Valhalla death sausage.

00:25:17.720 --> 00:25:19.720
 And I was wondering if you could perhaps do a taste of it

00:25:19.720 --> 00:25:21.720
 for me.

00:25:21.720 --> 00:25:23.720
 I think Andy's Sausage Podcast

00:25:23.720 --> 00:25:25.720
 is

00:25:25.720 --> 00:25:27.720
 ready, isn't it?

00:25:27.720 --> 00:25:29.720
 I think that would be a banger.

00:25:29.720 --> 00:25:31.720
 Oh, no.

00:25:31.720 --> 00:25:33.720
 Is that the name of it?

00:25:33.720 --> 00:25:35.720
 Bangers.

00:25:35.720 --> 00:25:37.720
 Andy's Sausage Party.

00:25:37.720 --> 00:25:39.720
 There we go.

00:25:39.720 --> 00:25:41.720
 Sausage Party has been used, unfortunately.

00:25:41.720 --> 00:25:43.720
 I know, but for a different format.

00:25:43.720 --> 00:25:45.720
 Medium.

00:25:45.720 --> 00:25:47.720
 Jill Goodfellow writes about

00:25:47.720 --> 00:25:49.720
 Spanker.

00:25:49.720 --> 00:25:51.720
 Loved your last podcast.

00:25:51.720 --> 00:25:53.720
 This was the election one we did.

00:25:53.720 --> 00:25:55.720
 But having worked pretty well on all the elections

00:25:55.720 --> 00:25:57.720
 of all types over the last 30 years

00:25:57.720 --> 00:25:59.720
 in our packages of kit from shore and sun,

00:25:59.720 --> 00:26:01.720
 which was the company we talked about,

00:26:01.720 --> 00:26:03.720
 we have never been supplied with a Spanker.

00:26:03.720 --> 00:26:05.720
 Really?

00:26:05.720 --> 00:26:07.720
 I think we've been shortchanged.

00:26:07.720 --> 00:26:09.720
 On rare occasions that we have a full box,

00:26:09.720 --> 00:26:11.720
 we have to resort to the shore supplied ruler

00:26:11.720 --> 00:26:13.720
 to tamp the papers down.

00:26:13.720 --> 00:26:15.720
 Jill, you fool.

00:26:15.720 --> 00:26:17.720
 It's...

00:26:17.720 --> 00:26:23.720
 It's a plastic ruler that they provide you

00:26:23.720 --> 00:26:25.720
 to push the safest out.

00:26:25.720 --> 00:26:27.720
 Poor Jill.

00:26:27.720 --> 00:26:29.720
 Where's the Spanker?

00:26:29.720 --> 00:26:31.720
 There are a lot of rulers in the corner

00:26:31.720 --> 00:26:33.720
 for every year.

00:26:33.720 --> 00:26:35.720
 Oh, she must have been so excited

00:26:35.720 --> 00:26:37.720
 if she was listening to this episode.

00:26:37.720 --> 00:26:39.720
 Andy's brought up my email.

00:26:39.720 --> 00:26:41.720
 Jill, you fucking moron.

00:26:41.720 --> 00:26:43.720
 I didn't say that.

00:26:43.720 --> 00:26:45.720
 I gently and politely said, "You fool."

00:26:45.720 --> 00:26:47.720
 That's very funny.

00:26:47.720 --> 00:26:49.720
 And she's a poll clerk.

00:26:49.720 --> 00:26:51.720
 She's keeping democracy together here.

00:26:51.720 --> 00:26:53.720
 Oh, God, and we respect her.

00:26:53.720 --> 00:26:55.720
 We do. Thank you, Jill, for your service.

00:26:55.720 --> 00:26:57.720
 There's another email here

00:26:57.720 --> 00:26:59.720
 which does come with a photo from Dana May Gaynor.

00:26:59.720 --> 00:27:01.720
 What a great name.

00:27:01.720 --> 00:27:03.720
 Sorry, Dana May Gaynor.

00:27:03.720 --> 00:27:05.720
 Dana May Gaynor.

00:27:05.720 --> 00:27:07.720
 I thoroughly enjoyed your recent show,

00:27:07.720 --> 00:27:09.720
 but I regret to inform you there is such a thing

00:27:09.720 --> 00:27:11.720
 as sausage cats.

00:27:11.720 --> 00:27:13.720
 The breed is called munchkin,

00:27:13.720 --> 00:27:15.720
 and these cats have extremely short legs

00:27:15.720 --> 00:27:17.720
 on a normal cat body, so they're much longer

00:27:17.720 --> 00:27:19.720
 than they are tall. See here.

00:27:19.720 --> 00:27:21.720
 Oh, yeah.

00:27:21.720 --> 00:27:23.720
 She's included a picture of quite a long cat

00:27:23.720 --> 00:27:25.720
 with short legs. Fair enough.

00:27:25.720 --> 00:27:27.720
 She actually looks a bit like my cat,

00:27:27.720 --> 00:27:29.720
 but if you took the middle bit

00:27:29.720 --> 00:27:31.720
 of another cat and then sort of

00:27:31.720 --> 00:27:33.720
 spliced it in.

00:27:33.720 --> 00:27:35.720
 Like how they make cruise ships bigger.

00:27:35.720 --> 00:27:37.720
 Exactly, yeah.

00:27:37.720 --> 00:27:39.720
 Nice. Anyway, great email.

00:27:39.720 --> 00:27:41.720
 Dana May. Good to know.

00:27:41.720 --> 00:27:43.720
 Nice to see the cat.

00:27:43.720 --> 00:27:45.720
 Bye.

00:27:45.720 --> 00:27:51.720
 No, thank you for listening, everyone.

00:27:51.720 --> 00:27:53.720
 That was Drop of the Line, another month over.

00:27:53.720 --> 00:27:55.720
 I've just realised, by the way,

00:27:55.720 --> 00:27:57.720
 that I think the word we've invented boffin

00:27:57.720 --> 00:27:59.720
 might be the only word in the English language

00:27:59.720 --> 00:28:01.720
 with a quadruple F,

00:28:01.720 --> 00:28:03.720
 because I've just remembered the boff has a triple F.

00:28:03.720 --> 00:28:05.720
 I think it's big old fecund female fish,

00:28:05.720 --> 00:28:07.720
 and then we need to have fin.

00:28:07.720 --> 00:28:09.720
 We need to have fin.

00:28:09.720 --> 00:28:11.720
 So that's boffin.

00:28:11.720 --> 00:28:13.720
 Quadruple F. Isn't that cool?

00:28:13.720 --> 00:28:15.720
 What a great last thought to crowbar in

00:28:15.720 --> 00:28:17.720
 as we do the outro. Thank you, Anna.

00:28:17.720 --> 00:28:19.720
 As we get to the fin.

00:28:19.720 --> 00:28:21.720
 Wow.

00:28:21.720 --> 00:28:23.720
 But if you've enjoyed this kind of

00:28:23.720 --> 00:28:25.720
 razor sharp rep RT

00:28:25.720 --> 00:28:27.720
 and you want more of it, you just have to wait

00:28:27.720 --> 00:28:29.720
 a month and remain a member of Club Fish.

00:28:29.720 --> 00:28:31.720
 You don't need to do anything, actually.

00:28:31.720 --> 00:28:33.720
 But do write in if you've been affected

00:28:33.720 --> 00:28:35.720
 by any of the issues raised in this programme.

00:28:35.720 --> 00:28:37.720
 We're here for it.

00:28:37.720 --> 00:28:39.720
 Podcast@QI.com. Please do keep writing in

00:28:39.720 --> 00:28:41.720
 unless it's about a mistake we've made

00:28:41.720 --> 00:28:43.720
 or unless it's about, I can't believe it's not butter

00:28:43.720 --> 00:28:45.720
 because I think that's just closed that box now.

00:28:45.720 --> 00:28:47.720
 Thanks very much. See you next time.

00:28:47.720 --> 00:28:49.720
 Bye.
