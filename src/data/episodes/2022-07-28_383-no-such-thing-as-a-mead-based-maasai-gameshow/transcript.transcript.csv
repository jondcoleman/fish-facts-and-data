00:00:14,00:00:20,"Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming to"
00:00:20,00:00:26,"you from four undisclosed locations in the UK. My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here with"
00:00:26,00:00:30,"James Harkin, Anna Tyshinski and Andrew Hunter Murray and once again we have gathered around"
00:00:30,00:00:36,the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days and in no particular order
00:00:36,00:00:42,"here we go. Starting with fact number one and that's my fact this week, my fact is that the"
00:00:42,00:00:49,world's longest golf putt took 26 seconds for the ball to reach the hole. In that time it covered
00:00:49,00:00:57,"a distance of over nine miles. So Dan, I've just done some calculations just before we came on"
00:00:57,00:01:04,and I reckon that means they must have hit the ball at about just over 1200 miles per hour.
00:01:04,00:01:08,And is that good James? I know you play golf. Well I've just been watching the open just
00:01:08,00:01:13,before we came on as well and Bryson DeChambeau who most people think hits it the hardest and
00:01:13,00:01:18,fastest of anyone can hit it at a maximum of 140 miles an hour so what the fuck's going on?
00:01:19,00:01:25,Okay so yes you are correct in your calculation but incorrect in how this record was set.
00:01:25,00:01:34,This was set aboard Concorde. Yeah so it is a cheat. I was talking to our good buddy Jason
00:01:34,00:01:40,Haisley and this came up in conversation. He mentioned that a record had been set by someone
00:01:40,00:01:46,who had basically used the idea that the distance that you would travel on Concorde matched with
00:01:46,00:01:53,a putt that could travel the distance of Concorde into a hole would set the record. So the record
00:01:53,00:02:00,that is held currently is by a guy called Jose Maria Olathalbo and he's a golfer who in 1999
00:02:00,00:02:05,was on the Ryder Cup's team Concorde flight to the United States and during the whole trip he
00:02:05,00:02:12,spent most of the time in the aisle trying to break the record for longest putt ever. Right.
00:02:12,00:02:18,And so the putt that he achieved was 26.17 seconds long so it covered the 150 feet of the cabin
00:02:18,00:02:26,but as a result of the distance traveled by Concorde that was 9.2 miles that he traveled.
00:02:26,00:02:31,I can only imagine how hard it was for the poor bloody air stewards to serve the drinks
00:02:31,00:02:37,around this golfer. The other thing is when you're playing golf it's always more difficult to play
00:02:37,00:02:43,over water but presumably this whole shot was over water. Yes exactly but also you know I'd
00:02:43,00:02:48,mention he tried to break the world record. This isn't the first time that someone has set the record
00:02:48,00:02:55,of longest golf putt done on a Concorde airplane so a couple years before in 1997 there was a guy
00:02:55,00:03:00,called Brad Faxon and he set the record. Now what's interesting is I managed to find a blog
00:03:00,00:03:05,about the story of how this happened and I think it's a cheat his record setting because
00:03:05,00:03:12,as opposed to this other completely legitimate. Well as far as I can tell the current record
00:03:12,00:03:18,holder did it by hitting it and getting it into the hole on his own but in this blog about Brad
00:03:18,00:03:23,Faxon it sounds like he hit the ball and then all of the passengers were putting their hand
00:03:23,00:03:28,and feet in the way navigating the ball. That doesn't count. Exactly that doesn't count.
00:03:28,00:03:36,I have a question Dan. How did they make a hole in Concorde? In fact that made it easier to sink
00:03:36,00:03:40,the ball because everything was being sucked towards the massive hole in the fuselage of the
00:03:40,00:03:45,plane they just drilled. Is that what happened? No I think it must have been a cup on its side.
00:03:45,00:03:50,For such an important record the scant detail. Such an important record.
00:03:52,00:03:57,World changing record was set today. As far as I could tell the first person to ever hold the
00:03:57,00:04:03,record was not a professional golfer but was Suggs from the band Madness who initially did it
00:04:03,00:04:07,and what did you mean the longest putt or do you mean on Concorde? On Concorde the longest putt
00:04:07,00:04:12,on Concorde. No wonder Concorde went out of business the number of golfers just queuing up
00:04:12,00:04:20,taking up valuable spaces for people with their bags. The longest golf shot ever or what was often
00:04:20,00:04:25,claimed or speculated to be one of the longest happened on the moon right? I think we've mentioned
00:04:25,00:04:30,before Alan Shepard did a golf shot on the moon and it was it was never a record breaker or anything
00:04:30,00:04:35,but everyone always just said god that must have gone miles because obviously gravity on the moon
00:04:35,00:04:40,is a sixth of what it is now so you should be hitting it six times as far and there's the I
00:04:40,00:04:47,think there's the footage and when he hit it this is on Apollo 14 1971 he missed it the first one
00:04:47,00:04:53,which we've mentioned before hit the second and disappeared out of shot and he was like wow god
00:04:53,00:04:58,I reckon that's gone a long way he actually said about 200 yards which still is not as far as
00:04:58,00:05:04,professionals will hit it but they recently analyzed the videos of his golf shots and zoomed right in
00:05:04,00:05:10,and they worked out where he was standing because they saw his footprints and where the ball landed
00:05:10,00:05:18,and he hit the ball 40 yards which in earth yards I guess that would be what like seven
00:05:18,00:05:23,seven yards he basically hit at the equivalent of on earth wow wow var has really ruined more
00:05:23,00:05:30,things than we realized yeah as someone who once lost a cricket ball throwing competition
00:05:30,00:05:37,aged about 15 or 16 to a seven-year-old girl I don't think we should criticize this guy too much
00:05:37,00:05:42,but cricket ball throwing yeah it was a cricket ball throwing competition it was in Germany
00:05:42,00:05:47,and why why were you representing the UK the world cricket ball throwing championships
00:05:47,00:05:55,that's a fair point I guess they didn't have much interest from elsewhere yeah oh god amazing
00:05:55,00:06:01,anyway speaking of sport of the sports what sport do you reckon has the fastest ball of not being
00:06:01,00:06:09,played on concord just generally what about squash squash faster for sure okay it's not going to be
00:06:09,00:06:15,table tennis it's not ping-pong no the answer is pilota you know that game that they play in the
00:06:15,00:06:22,catalan region of spain oh yeah yeah I'm so excited about the pilota world cup coming up soon well
00:06:22,00:06:26,apparently you're representing the UK and that's all I think I don't know if you know it's basically
00:06:26,00:06:32,a game where you you have these gloves but they have like a slope on them and so you catch the
00:06:32,00:06:37,ball in midair it's a bit like squash and then you flick the ball using your hand and with this
00:06:37,00:06:42,slope and it really gives it a massive speed but I thought that's about 180 miles an hour the best
00:06:42,00:06:49,tennis serve about 160 I thought maybe quidditch but the quidditch broomsticks apparently according
00:06:49,00:06:55,to the internet I haven't read the books at all so I might be wrong about this only 150 miles an hour
00:06:55,00:07:02,the fastest brooms go so my pedestrian sport really but then if you throw the um I want to say
00:07:02,00:07:08,snitch from a broomstick no no no no no no come on let's throw the snitch come on come on a broomstick
00:07:08,00:07:13,if you catch the snitch the game ends your team gets 150 points right sorry well you're throwing
00:07:13,00:07:20,some sort of balls presumably you might throw a quaffle or a blusher it's a quaffle yeah right
00:07:20,00:07:24,so you quiff the quaffle off the broomstick while going at 150 miles an hour you give that some
00:07:24,00:07:31,extra speed yeah it's like shouting a torch out of a car exactly no hang on that's still the speed
00:07:31,00:07:37,of light it's exactly unlike shouting a torch in actual fact you've chosen the one thing light
00:07:37,00:07:46,which doesn't act like a ball you know a hole in one uh the phenomenon of a hole in one I did not
00:07:46,00:07:50,know this you can get a hole in one insurance if you own a golf course what do you mean basically
00:07:50,00:07:54,lots of golf courses offer prizes you know huge prizes if you got a hole in one on this hole
00:07:54,00:08:00,we will give you 50 000 pounds and that's obviously quite risky for a golf course in case someone just
00:08:00,00:08:06,turns up and does it so there is special insurance and you pick a main hole and you can also get
00:08:06,00:08:11,optional prize cover for five other holes in the policy I read I'm sure they vary but yeah I just
00:08:11,00:08:15,had no idea that was a special insurer that's very cool yeah so you're um encouraged to get
00:08:15,00:08:20,insurance if you play golf because you're hitting balls quite often in the wrong directions in areas
00:08:20,00:08:25,where there are people but part of your insurance will often be hole in one insurance and that's
00:08:25,00:08:29,because when you get a hole in one you're kind of supposed to buy everyone else in the club a drink
00:08:29,00:08:35,and so if you do get it and you pay for that then your insurance will pay for that round of drinks
00:08:35,00:08:40,really that's brilliant so that's kind of stingy isn't it people are saying even on that day when
00:08:40,00:08:44,presumably they're winning this massive prize from the golf course anyway they're not going to buy
00:08:44,00:08:48,the five other blokes in the golf bar a drink the poor people at Aviva who are dealing with two
00:08:48,00:08:52,competing claims one for 50 000 pounds for one for the biggest round of drinks ever
00:08:52,00:08:59,wow that's amazing well you say things golf balls often do get hit in the wrong direction
00:08:59,00:09:04,right and one particular group of people who is prone to doing this are American politicians
00:09:04,00:09:11,so i think maybe the record for the most disastrous misdirected hit is held by Spiro Agnew
00:09:11,00:09:17,so this was 1971 i think so he was former former vice president this is thank you i was going to
00:09:17,00:09:21,say just for the just for the younger listeners he explains who Spiro Agnew is
00:09:21,00:09:29,come on if you've heard his name once which you probably have you never forget that name
00:09:29,00:09:36,so no one needs to contextualize it's the bob hope classic tournament in 1971 this is like a lot of
00:09:36,00:09:41,celebrities took part in this a lot of presidents have played in it and i think he might be the
00:09:41,00:09:49,only person to hit three people with two shots so he hit one shot and it hit a husband and wife
00:09:49,00:09:55,couple both so rebounded off one smacked into the other he paused went up to apologize how embarrassing
00:09:55,00:10:00,for me i'm a public figure went back down put it back on the tee and thwacked another woman
00:10:00,00:10:06,who had to go to hospital no my god yeah did he then continue oh yeah he absolutely nailed it
00:10:06,00:10:11,after that you get your bad shots out the way that's amazing and i think was he working with
00:10:11,00:10:17,Gerald Ford he was at the time wasn't he who also once hit the same woman twice from the same tee
00:10:17,00:10:24,you're kidding did she move did she move in between shots one and two that's a really good question
00:10:24,00:10:27,in which case you think it's her fault because obviously he's not going to hit it to the same
00:10:27,00:10:31,place i don't think i'm sorry i don't think i'm saying it's her fault i'm just saying it would
00:10:31,00:10:36,be interesting if she moved and that implies that he was drawn towards her somehow okay i guess if
00:10:36,00:10:41,she didn't it also could imply that she could have been wearing like a giant flag on her head
00:10:41,00:10:47,yeah he thought she was the whole she was actually she had an enormous hole um in the middle of her
00:10:47,00:10:55,diaphragm okay oh that's who you guys know who the number one female golfer in the world is at
00:10:55,00:11:01,the moment type of recording no no come on guys it's not sexist because i don't know the number
00:11:01,00:11:06,i don't know either yeah fair enough the number one female golfer is a woman called Nelly Corder
00:11:06,00:11:14,the number 13 golfer is her sister Jessica Corder and you might know the name if you follow
00:11:14,00:11:20,tennis because their brother is Sebastian Corder who is currently the 46th best player in the world
00:11:20,00:11:24,and was the first player born in the 2000s to reach the fourth round of any grand slam event
00:11:24,00:11:30,wow imagine that family the father is Pettacorder who was a former number two tennis player in the
00:11:30,00:11:37,world and an Australian open winner and their mother is Regina Corder Ney Reichstover who
00:11:37,00:11:42,was a former tennis top 30 player as well wow imagine that family at Christmas their grandfather
00:11:42,00:11:50,was Concorda who invented it shall we talk about concord yeah yeah concord was absolutely amazing
00:11:50,00:11:57,it says kind of sad that it's defunct i i love the fact that i had a wiggly nose yeah which i didn't
00:11:57,00:12:02,really know because you see photos of it looking slightly skew if the nose they could genuinely
00:12:02,00:12:05,from the cockpit control where the nose was and it was simply so they could see the runway because
00:12:05,00:12:10,when the nose was in its up up position the pilots coming into land couldn't see the runway nearly
00:12:10,00:12:16,as clearly obviously advantage to see the runway so they just had a boom and you could see it tilt
00:12:16,00:12:19,down and they could see the runway at land and it made that noise didn't it yes absolutely it's probably
00:12:19,00:12:26,noise yeah oh i've just lost my sex drive sound effect do you guys know the oldest person ever
00:12:26,00:12:35,to fly on concord um gosh i don't was it um what who's old you do you mean old now because all of
00:12:35,00:12:40,them are fairly old well that's a good point yeah okay i'm gonna say this is a trick question
00:12:40,00:12:45,i reckon your like a mummy was transported from ancient egypt or something like that's classic
00:12:45,00:12:53,and oh it's bound to be that what a great lucy the ancestor of all the um homoerectasis yeah
00:12:53,00:12:58,some primordial soup was brought on board and served would you like the chicken or the fish or
00:12:58,00:13:07,the primordial soup poor andy he now just has to tell us it's a 61 that is very true well there's
00:13:07,00:13:11,been a few all these on there the queen mum celebrated her 85th birthday by going on concord
00:13:11,00:13:14,and sitting in the cockpit she's not the oldest person ever the oldest person ever was a woman
00:13:14,00:13:23,called eve woodman okay she flew on concord in 1998 and she was aged 105 born in 1893 and what
00:13:23,00:13:28,i really like is this when she went on the flight it was only the second time in her life she had
00:13:28,00:13:36,left bristol wow isn't that incredible that's amazing did honor waiting for the right moment
00:13:36,00:13:39,she would have been 11 years old at the time of the first flight of the right brothers
00:13:39,00:13:43,she was born at a time when cars were pretty bloody surprising
00:13:43,00:13:50,that's true concord was maybe not used to transport mummies but concord was used to transport body
00:13:50,00:13:56,parts which i didn't realize so the actual speed of concord had served a genuine purpose medical
00:13:56,00:14:01,purpose and apparently ba concords were quite often used to transport organs that needed to be
00:14:01,00:14:08,quickly relayed to somewhere else to be donated and there was one incident according to concord
00:14:08,00:14:13,magazine where french concord had to ship a really rare anti-venom to someone who'd had a snakebite
00:14:13,00:14:19,somewhere in africa oh my god and yeah and and because you've got such limited time it was
00:14:19,00:14:23,literally like if they'd just gone aboard a normal ba flight then wouldn't have made it in time but
00:14:23,00:14:28,the person survived because it whizzed over there so fast but concord doesn't fly to africa does it
00:14:28,00:14:32,well i think i suppose it flies to wherever the person gets bitten by the snake if it's
00:14:32,00:14:39,it probably wasn't a scheduled flight is what i'm saying do you mind if you could get him from
00:14:39,00:14:45,sudan to amsterdam then yeah we'll give him the antebellum no i think it diverted paul mccarney
00:14:45,00:14:50,once ordered a pizza to be flown from new york to london by concord yeah i don't get that i i
00:14:50,00:14:55,i'm trying to find out more about that was it a cooked pizza was it like a sainsbury's it would
00:14:55,00:15:01,be cold wouldn't it it would be i think it was from his favorite pizza place hmm i you'd imagine
00:15:01,00:15:06,it would be rather he wouldn't have got it from dominos in new york if there's dominos in london
00:15:06,00:15:11,would he he might have had vouchers for the one in london that he couldn't trade in in new york
00:15:11,00:15:18,well yeah was he misled as to how fast concord was it is possible if your delivery arrives after
00:15:18,00:15:23,two and a half three hours it is still going to be lukewarm at best i wonder if the pizza got its
00:15:23,00:15:29,own seat and stuff i wonder that i do wonder that um i would like to think it did there was
00:15:29,00:15:33,a thing where you could save money by being a courier and so if there were sensitive documents
00:15:33,00:15:36,that had to be delivered you would get a cheaper ticket on concord so maybe the pizza had its own
00:15:36,00:15:41,special courier yeah that's interesting i imagine if the pizza just comes out at the other end and
00:15:41,00:15:48,there's a guy with a sign which just has a pizza on it there were quite a lot of famous people that
00:15:48,00:15:54,did travel concord that have led to stories like this like phil collins famously with live aid
00:15:54,00:16:00,played in london and was able to fly to america to play for the end of the day uh over there and
00:16:00,00:16:06,there's a story of urie galler being on the plane and he visits he visits the captain in the cockpit
00:16:06,00:16:11,get get him out of here he's going to bend everything in sight interestingly the nose was
00:16:11,00:16:19,completely straight until he got him he went into the flight deck and he said i can spin the compass
00:16:19,00:16:24,on your instruments and thanks urie thanks a lot fucking don't yeah because presumably he's doing it
00:16:24,00:16:30,with a hidden like um you know magnet or something right it's got to be a trick so why are you letting
00:16:30,00:16:34,him on with that exactly so the captain said i thought at 37 kilometers a minute are we being
00:16:34,00:16:40,wise to allow this man to fiddle with the navigation and he did he let him he let him do it um i think
00:16:40,00:16:45,though he did it on the standby compass which is still you need it it's a standby compass sure and
00:16:45,00:16:50,he said sure enough it whizzed around i've never seen anything like it and uh when it stopped i'm
00:16:50,00:16:54,pleased to say it went back to show it accurately where we were going what a surprise just like what
00:16:54,00:17:07,would happen if you bugged it there yeah exactly okay it is time for fact number two and that is
00:17:07,00:17:12,Anna my fact this week is that some fish use sharks as scratching posts
00:17:12,00:17:20,brave fish yeah and also like my cat uses scratching posts to kind of get her nails down
00:17:20,00:17:26,and fish don't have nails so what's going on oh yeah what's no but they do have parasites
00:17:26,00:17:31,and so they like to rub themselves off against rough surfaces to get rid of those or scratch
00:17:31,00:17:36,that itch and the adrenaline junkies among them scratch up against sharks and this has been
00:17:36,00:17:40,documented in lots of places underwater so i first read about it there's a photographer who
00:17:40,00:17:46,spotted a crowd of jack kind of fish enveloping a massive bull shark and found out later this is
00:17:46,00:17:51,what they do they rub up against them and it seems to happen everywhere so i found a picture of
00:17:51,00:17:57,mackerel rubbing up against a great white very bold very bold and uh even sharks rubbing up
00:17:57,00:18:02,against other sharks sometimes there are silky sharks rubbing up against whale sharks to scratch
00:18:02,00:18:08,themselves wow so it must be harsh to like sharks it's not their fault they got this rough skin and
00:18:08,00:18:13,they've just become kind of everyone's using them right and they're so rough aren't they i i didn't
00:18:13,00:18:18,really realize this because i've never obviously touched a shark but um shark for example can
00:18:18,00:18:23,destroy human skin with their own skin so sometimes people who try to rescue sharks
00:18:23,00:18:28,which have washed up on land uh if they handle them they end up with shark burn where basically
00:18:28,00:18:34,their skin is just so rough that they destroy your fingers in your hands yeah wow what like classic
00:18:34,00:18:38,gray smooth sharks because that just looks like that's such a smooth surface the amazing thing
00:18:38,00:18:43,about them which is just so cool is they're basically made of loads of teeth aren't they
00:18:43,00:18:49,so their skin is loads of these tiny tiny teeth called dermal denticles and if you zoom in they do
00:18:49,00:18:56,look like kind of layers of oval overlapping teeth and they literally are jaws they are very nice
00:18:56,00:19:03,they're entirely and they're as hard as granite um and as strong as steel and they're made of
00:19:03,00:19:12,material called appetite oh wow and also here's a thing um sharks do lose their appetite sometimes
00:19:12,00:19:18,because they get dandruff which means bits of their skins the dermal denticles kind of fall off
00:19:18,00:19:24,and what's really useful about that is we can go into the bottom of the sea and find these
00:19:24,00:19:29,bits of shark dandruff and it can tell us quite a lot about the number of sharks that lived in an
00:19:29,00:19:33,area over many men because it doesn't it's really hard stuff it doesn't really degrade very much
00:19:33,00:19:38,so it's all there from hundreds and hundreds and thousands and millions and years of wow it's really
00:19:38,00:19:43,helpful if you're looking after coral reefs for instance you can work out how many um sharks
00:19:43,00:19:48,were there how a stick the water was all that kind of stuff and people are using this shark dandruff
00:19:48,00:19:54,to do that oh so cool that's amazing the shark that was mentioned in this article was a bull shark
00:19:54,00:20:00,and bull sharks very fascinating sharks they have this incredible ability to swim in both salt and
00:20:00,00:20:07,freshwater uh so do i so do i yeah hi uh yeah sorry let me let me rephrase that they can live
00:20:07,00:20:14,underwater in salt or fresh water those things and um as a result these sharks can be found in
00:20:14,00:20:20,really odd spots and one place in particular that bull sharks are found in is a place called
00:20:20,00:20:26,carbrook golf course in queensland where following a flood where the golf course was flooded bull
00:20:26,00:20:32,sharks swam into the local lake that's in the golf course and then stayed there once the flooding
00:20:32,00:20:38,went down so they're permanently there these giant bull sharks as part of the the golf course
00:20:38,00:20:42,someone's got to break that putting record by putting it onto the back of a shark which swims
00:20:42,00:20:49,the entire length of the lake deposits on the other side whale sharks that's a kind of shark
00:20:49,00:20:56,they're absolutely huge they have remora on them the sucking parasitic creatures but they make a
00:20:56,00:21:04,lovely meal these remoras for birds however how do you get from the bird to the shark underwater
00:21:04,00:21:09,it's really cool what they do is there's only one bit of scientific footage of this happening i believe
00:21:10,00:21:16,the cormorants will dive bomb into the water they will swim down once they're underwater
00:21:16,00:21:20,and then once they get to the surface of the whale shark they will peck away at the remora on the
00:21:20,00:21:25,surface basically try to chisel it off because it's stuck on you know with really strong adhesive
00:21:25,00:21:30,and pry it away from the surface of the whale and they do this you know losing oxygen all the time and
00:21:30,00:21:34,then swim back up and they got there they got the meal the remora are amazing aren't they when you
00:21:34,00:21:38,see have you seen photos of them this little suction pad i've never heard remora i must say
00:21:38,00:21:43,i've never heard that so they're quite a big fish and they're they're different in say like pilot
00:21:43,00:21:48,fish that pilot fish will swim alongside the shark and they will eat parasites along the way and
00:21:48,00:21:53,clean up around them and hence the symbiotic relationship but the remora literally on the
00:21:53,00:21:59,top of their head have this insane suction pad and they just rock up to the side of a shark
00:21:59,00:22:05,and they just go and suck themselves on with their head the right way up and they just get free
00:22:05,00:22:09,transport along the way and they're really important to some of these sharks to the point
00:22:09,00:22:15,where the shark will put itself in danger to help the remora suck on but they live off shark poo
00:22:15,00:22:19,don't they i think some of them they now think they thought they lived off like they feed off the
00:22:19,00:22:23,parasites on the shark and live off sort of scraps of food falling out of the shark's mouth which is
00:22:23,00:22:29,a kind of ignominious existence but now even worse they eat shark poo some of them we think and that's
00:22:29,00:22:34,what they get there so it's no it's no kind of life because there are these fecal plumes that
00:22:34,00:22:40,sharks produce and really big sharks produce thousands of liters in this plume you know it's
00:22:40,00:22:45,30 feet across whale sharks they produce this huge great plume but if the shark is swimming i don't
00:22:45,00:22:51,actually know how the remora manages to eat that maybe it detaches and swims around them yeah they
00:22:51,00:22:55,detach i think they're they're only attached for great travel so they they travel and then they
00:22:55,00:23:01,pause and i think they disattach and eat you know they they parasites off their faces and so on and
00:23:01,00:23:04,that's tough though that's like being driven to a restaurant you jump out the car but the car
00:23:04,00:23:09,continues driving on and then you have to catch it up after your meal yeah it's like a drive-thru no
00:23:09,00:23:15,not like a drive-thru no that's it unless your your parents hated you they drove you to the drive-thru
00:23:15,00:23:24,and then just drove away i like it look it was a fun game and it didn't do me any harm
00:23:25,00:23:30,i grew up well adjusted um greenland sharks you know we've mentioned those guys before the
00:23:30,00:23:37,really slow swimming dance favorite shark yeah they are often partially or completely blind
00:23:37,00:23:43,because they have these copepods which are tiny crustacean like creatures attached to their eyes
00:23:43,00:23:47,but the great news for the greenland shark is that they're swimming in such deep water
00:23:47,00:23:53,that the sharks don't care because it's so dark that they don't actually need their eyesight very
00:23:53,00:23:59,much well but there's also a theory which is not yet proved but that the copepod might be
00:23:59,00:24:07,bi-luminescent and because of that it's attracting prey towards the greenland shark which travels
00:24:07,00:24:12,at one mile an hour it's the slowest shark in the world top speed is two miles like we could
00:24:12,00:24:18,out swim this shark basically so in the greenland shark version of jaws the music doesn't speed up
00:24:18,00:24:27,at all it just stays forever exactly and so the idea is that the copepods are attracting prey to
00:24:27,00:24:33,eat that and it's basically bringing food to the face of the greenland shark nice so it's again
00:24:33,00:24:39,symbiotic is the theory because what that makes sense because i've read recently that 90 percent
00:24:39,00:24:45,of creatures in the ocean are glow-in-the-dark a bioluminescent and we and they're just sort of
00:24:45,00:24:50,discovering this and realizing all these all these animals deep sea animals that are glow-in-the-dark
00:24:50,00:24:55,lantern sharks they glow i think they're luminescent underneath and so that if you look at them
00:24:55,00:24:59,from underneath it looks like it's just the bright sky and you don't realize that there's a shark
00:24:59,00:25:05,there's camouflage yeah that's weird having a light that is also camouflage that's clever yeah
00:25:05,00:25:09,if you lived in blackpool with all the illuminations and you wanted to kind of camouflage
00:25:09,00:25:14,yourself there then it would make sense to cover yourself in lots of bright lights right absolutely
00:25:14,00:25:18,it all depends where you live no no completely but what a terrifying
00:25:18,00:25:23,version of a serial killer you've just thought of James who goes around covered in christmas lights
00:25:23,00:25:25,but only in blackpool
00:25:25,00:25:35,we've never talked about the shark murder case in sydney which just feels like if people don't
00:25:35,00:25:40,know about that you need to because it's such a good story this is basically 1935 there's an
00:25:40,00:25:45,aquarium in sydney there's a tiger shark there are loads of people admiring it and suddenly it
00:25:45,00:25:53,vomits up a human arm and this thank you good sound effects and this launched this massive
00:25:53,00:25:58,murder investigation so it was an arm which when they studied it it obviously been cut off
00:25:58,00:26:03,by someone as opposed to eating by the shark it had a tattoo on it which was identified as the
00:26:03,00:26:08,arm of this kind of boxer cum criminal it actually turned out the shark hadn't eaten the arm the shark
00:26:08,00:26:15,had eaten a smaller shark and that smaller shark had eaten the arm wow what a tangled web this is
00:26:15,00:26:20,this is incredible wow it was awesome it's never been solved to this day this crime because this
00:26:20,00:26:26,guy got accused uh this guy called reginald holmes and he denied it all he got really really drunk
00:26:26,00:26:30,and got his boat out into sydney harbour i think he tried to shoot himself in the head to get away
00:26:30,00:26:36,from the um accusation but instead the bullet flattened against his skull knocked him into the
00:26:36,00:26:42,water whoa did he have a skull made of iron or what like how does that work what the hell i don't
00:26:42,00:26:46,know what reginald holmes is made of but this bullet was flat and his skull was fine he got a
00:26:46,00:26:53,mark and cushion what he climbed back into against his skull a lot of this story was
00:26:53,00:26:59,unbelievable that put that bit in particular so okay so he's in the water he's got a bullet made
00:26:59,00:27:05,of jelly yeah and he's got his skull made of iron and he climbs back into his speed boat and there's
00:27:05,00:27:09,a police chase around sydney harbour which lasts for a few hours and eventually i'm amazed that it
00:27:09,00:27:14,lasts a few hours given that he's been shot in the head by himself shortly before this he's hard
00:27:14,00:27:22,cool maybe he's that guy from james bond with the metal face anyway jules yeah jules yeah the other
00:27:22,00:27:27,jules so then he says okay fine i am involved he says his business associate had killed the victim
00:27:27,00:27:34,this guy called smith and had dismembered him cut him into pieces and he turned up at reginald holmes's
00:27:34,00:27:39,door because they had beef between them and he'd waved this severed arm at him and said look if
00:27:39,00:27:43,you don't do what i need you to do then you'll end up like whoever this guy was and he'd left the
00:27:43,00:27:48,severed arm with reginald holmes so holmes just tossed this arm into the water didn't really know
00:27:48,00:27:54,what to do with it and anyway then he was murdered the day before he was supposed to testify and the
00:27:54,00:27:59,case was never solved because even though they kind of knew it was the guy who holmes had said it
00:27:59,00:28:04,probably was it was determined that no one could prove anyone had been murdered because actually
00:28:04,00:28:09,a severed arm does not constitute enough of a body to suggest that anyone's been killed in the first
00:28:09,00:28:13,place the threshold of proving a murder in australia seems to be remarkably high
00:28:13,00:28:28,okay it is time for fact number three that is james okay in my fact this week is that 46 percent
00:28:28,00:28:34,of masai men have become friends with someone who got the wrong number and mistakenly called their
00:28:34,00:28:42,phone how fat are their fingers how lonely are the masai more importantly if i get a wrong number i
00:28:42,00:28:47,never try and befriend the person who's called me so i think i don't know anything about the
00:28:47,00:28:53,mechanics of how they use their phones so i can only answer andy's question really but basically
00:28:53,00:28:59,the masai these are traditionally nomadic people but their lifestyle is evolving quite a lot
00:28:59,00:29:04,like a lot of places around the world as the expansion of western society kind of globalizes
00:29:04,00:29:11,itself and there was a 2021 study about masai men who live in kenya and tanzania and it found that
00:29:11,00:29:18,because they work in big big areas and they don't see many people from day to day but it's really
00:29:18,00:29:23,really important for them to have these social networks because it means that you can sell your
00:29:23,00:29:29,goods better it's you know it's really important to kind of see people and speak to people they
00:29:29,00:29:34,have found this way of making friends where whenever anyone accidentally calls them and they're
00:29:34,00:29:40,speaking the ma language which is the language that they speak they automatically just start going
00:29:40,00:29:45,oh how's it going i don't suppose you want to buy any cows or some grain or whatever i don't you know
00:29:45,00:29:50,and they just basically start up a conversation so bizarre one of the mechanics for why they
00:29:50,00:29:56,miss call sometimes is it's to do with the fact that there's not great access to electricity
00:29:56,00:30:01,in many areas and so if you were in an area and your phone died but you wanted to call someone
00:30:01,00:30:05,you would borrow someone else's phone and in that case you'd have to manually put in a number off
00:30:05,00:30:10,memory and it's during the memory of it you would miss dial i didn't see that that's really interesting
00:30:10,00:30:14,i should say this is specifically men that they found this in there has been a study on
00:30:14,00:30:21,masai women by a woman called kelly summers who comes from virginia tech and she found that the
00:30:21,00:30:26,men are often using their phones to talk about people outside their social circle to try and make
00:30:26,00:30:31,contacts for selling things especially um whereas the women are mostly talking to each other other
00:30:31,00:30:37,people in the family unit in this in the local unit yeah so that's quite a gender line as far as
00:30:37,00:30:43,mobile phone uses in the masai yeah there's another division that is being created in
00:30:43,00:30:50,masai society not a serious division but according to a 2017 study people with mobile phones which
00:30:50,00:30:56,are dumb you know non-internet enabled as it were they call smartphone users because they
00:30:56,00:31:00,have the ability to download weather forecasts and if you're nomadic or a cattle herder weather
00:31:00,00:31:05,forecast is very important so this is basically a new system of being a tribal elder opening up
00:31:05,00:31:10,which is you know have you got an iphone or the equivalent that's very funny wait so they just
00:31:10,00:31:14,call they'll call loads of random numbers until someone picks up and they say hey are you on an
00:31:14,00:31:19,iphone and then they say great can you tell me no they'll know if one specific person has an iphone
00:31:19,00:31:23,they'll call them say can you download the latest weather forecast exactly yeah so that person's on
00:31:23,00:31:28,the phone all day long basically just delivering the weather god it's like being a being a weather
00:31:28,00:31:33,man or woman but instead of being on tv you just have to deliver the weather to every individual
00:31:33,00:31:39,person yeah that's hot yeah it's like being the speaking clock isn't it really yeah yeah
00:31:39,00:31:46,i'm never being so surprised when i was in kenya i went around kenya in tanzaneer in 2005
00:31:46,00:31:50,and i was on like a matatu one of those buses and there was a big masai guy and it's so tall most
00:31:50,00:31:55,of them sitting directly opposite me our knees were touching and i remember feeling kind of awkward
00:31:55,00:32:00,um and then he delved into his sort of coat and he whipped out a mobile phone and this was kind of
00:32:00,00:32:04,when i just got a mobile phone that was when you finally decided to get one wasn't it Anna it was
00:32:04,00:32:12,like you know what i thought yeah it is time but he was on a bus with you right yes like he's already
00:32:12,00:32:18,engaged in the modern world well he's on a matatu going into town to sell some uh meat i guess
00:32:18,00:32:23,did you have the meat with him uh yeah the rest of the passengers on the bus were all cows actually
00:32:23,00:32:29,have you guys heard of the masai spitting customs again i don't know if these are now
00:32:29,00:32:34,completely out of date and i suspect covid might have rendered them a little bit passive yeah it
00:32:34,00:32:38,doesn't sound very covid friendly does it no there's lots of spitting belief it's a bit considered
00:32:38,00:32:44,a blessing uh spitting so uh parents and friends might spit on a newborn baby to wish it luck
00:32:44,00:32:52,and health that makes sense absolutely yeah during masai weddings a father might spit on his daughter's
00:32:52,00:32:58,forehead and breasts as uh again as a as a blessing weird we're so weird to marry into that if you're
00:32:58,00:33:05,not aware isn't it yeah i'd take that as an insult and they do the classic uh spit on your hand
00:33:05,00:33:10,for a handshake as well which is often done as a sort of blood brothers with spit kind of thing
00:33:10,00:33:14,you spit on your own hand so yeah you spit on your own hand and then shake uh but that's that seems
00:33:14,00:33:19,to be a normal sort of handshake again as you say handy it might be out of date now but yeah
00:33:19,00:33:24,yeah god i like the idea though that andy you would spit on someone else's hand in a spit shake
00:33:24,00:33:28,i'm going to start suggesting that you hand out and you have to project sit onto their hand
00:33:28,00:33:36,there was a traditional way of preparing mead in the masai uh and that was that a man and a woman
00:33:36,00:33:42,would live in a hut and keep away from the rest of society while they're making the mead and while
00:33:42,00:33:47,you're doing it you have to abstain from engaging in any sexual intercourse it lasts about six to
00:33:47,00:33:53,seven days but if you don't follow that rule then it means that the mead will be undrinkable
00:33:53,00:33:57,and all the bees who produce the honey will leave the village forever
00:33:57,00:34:05,imagine if you had broken the rules just nervously presenting your tainted mead to the rest of the
00:34:05,00:34:10,tribe and seeing if they guess yeah i'm going hey where are those bees going no they're just
00:34:10,00:34:15,popping out they're popping out that would be a great masai game show you know what the mead makers
00:34:15,00:34:21,dirty mead yeah it's a panel of masai judges who have to work out whether the couple of mead
00:34:21,00:34:25,makers have had sex during the production prices of the mead it's like anti love island basically
00:34:25,00:34:29,we're just watching people try not have sex oh wait there is a new network show
00:34:29,00:34:36,i believe is that is that that's the premise is it yeah yeah well you're not allowed to have sex
00:34:36,00:34:40,right to protect the mead it's not they've actually they've cut the mead element from the
00:34:40,00:34:45,netflix show which i think is a huge blunder big mistake big mistake how's that gonna work
00:34:45,00:34:49,i mean i hope they haven't cast long married couples because that's just the girl for years
00:34:49,00:34:56,and not be a challenge for anyone the masai have now created their own intellectual property trust
00:34:56,00:35:01,because they're so second tired of big global companies using the name masai or using traditional
00:35:01,00:35:08,masai designs and so they are creating a body of intellectual property trained elders and they hope
00:35:08,00:35:11,that they'll be able to negotiate with firms on behalf of the masai obviously it's tricky because
00:35:11,00:35:15,you've got lots and lots of people who are you know very dispersed and it's hard to negotiate on
00:35:15,00:35:22,behalf of all the masai but they are trying to persuade firms to recognize the masai trademark
00:35:22,00:35:27,over their own name for example yeah because isn't there an estimate that over a thousand companies
00:35:27,00:35:33,use masai designs basically it's that sort of red check right and the beads you see those beads
00:35:33,00:35:39,everywhere belts and so like louis viton calvin kline yeah and obviously it's hard it's hard to
00:35:39,00:35:44,trademark beads for example but particular designs you might be able to or there are sometimes
00:35:44,00:35:49,voluntary codes of conduct which some native american groups have struck so that now it's
00:35:49,00:35:53,seen as an industry standard that if you use and guess you have to kind of get permission or or at
00:35:53,00:35:57,least talk to the people involved and there is somewhere you can go which has been the first
00:35:57,00:36:03,company to start paying them for their trademark called koi clothing so ko y which i was looking at
00:36:03,00:36:09,and the items for humans are very expensive but you can get a dog collar for 25 pounds so
00:36:12,00:36:18,some stuff on wrong numbers oh yeah yeah elon musk has an old phone number which he doesn't
00:36:18,00:36:25,use anymore but which lindsay tucker 25 year old skin care consultant does use oh no so she
00:36:25,00:36:32,regularly gets phone calls and text messages for elon musk one guy sent her a blueprint for a bionic
00:36:32,00:36:39,limb another guy in south africa have sent her a text message asking if he can buy 1000 trucks
00:36:40,00:36:49,and the irs called her asking about her tax amazing what did you say her job is she is a skin care
00:36:49,00:36:54,consultant oh well so that first one sounds quite useful what was the first call bionic limb that's
00:36:54,00:37:03,the one place you don't need skin care you need just the wd 40 yeah look if you if you get something
00:37:03,00:37:08,you say i'll try to fix your skin your cold soles on your leg and then it's like i've really screwed
00:37:08,00:37:13,that up i'm so sorry i had to amputate but on the bright side got a bionic limb i can see how that
00:37:13,00:37:16,would look it's unlikely yeah god it must be tempting some of the offers she gets she must be
00:37:16,00:37:21,really tempted to pretend to be his representative i'm sure she'll be caught pretty quickly but
00:37:21,00:37:27,according to the article i read she takes it in in her stride and she says that um if any of you
00:37:27,00:37:32,ever call elon musk or text him and you don't get a reply then don't feel hard done so you probably
00:37:32,00:37:37,rang her number and she doesn't get a chance to reply to everyone saying it's that so it's not
00:37:37,00:37:44,elon's fault and but it was it was npr and they did ask elon musk about it and he did say that
00:37:44,00:37:50,that was his number he can't believe that it's still in use it's so old that's amazing she should
00:37:50,00:37:57,start selling musk oh that's such a good idea great idea capitalize on it start selling elon's musk
00:37:57,00:38:05,the skin does he have that as a perfume company elon's musk he must do right he should he must
00:38:05,00:38:09,defeat i mean the exciting thing here at her is we could literally call this lady up and you
00:38:09,00:38:15,picture the idea right let's do it we've got her number no no the number wasn't printed at the
00:38:15,00:38:19,story because that would just make matters worse yeah it would be irresponsible journalism yeah
00:38:19,00:38:24,this person gets loads and loads of dodgy calls but here's her number anyway he just gets she needs
00:38:24,00:38:30,to know do you guys want to hear the greatest wrong number of all time yeah in my opinion okay
00:38:31,00:38:38,it happened in 1992 it was happened in dover there was a man called jason pegler he was walking
00:38:38,00:38:45,past a phone box right and it rang he answered the phone and the person ringing that phone box
00:38:45,00:38:50,wanted to speak to him the person making the call was a colleague of his who was ringing trying to
00:38:50,00:38:57,get through to jason asking how to work the office fax machine they hadn't phoned his phone number though
00:38:57,00:39:01,they had accidentally looked up his sheet at the company and phoned his employee number at the
00:39:01,00:39:07,company which happened to be the same as the number for the phone box and was he able to help out
00:39:07,00:39:14,with the fax situation i don't know you bastard i have no idea that isn't it i mean do you do you
00:39:14,00:39:19,buy this because it does sound unbelievable well yeah you're absolutely right it does sound
00:39:19,00:39:24,unbelievable it's collected by david spiegelhalter of cambridge university who has a website where he
00:39:24,00:39:29,collects unbelievable coincidences and this is one of them so i don't know what verification
00:39:29,00:39:34,he does but i think it might um i think it might be true actually i think it is legit i think i've
00:39:34,00:39:39,heard him be asked about it before the guy who answered the phone i bet he was loitering outside
00:39:39,00:39:45,that phone because he spotted that years earlier i suppose it's like the law of big numbers isn't
00:39:45,00:39:50,it you have enough billion people in the world and enough things happen that eventually more of them
00:39:50,00:39:55,will be an amazing coincidence exactly that it's exactly that i found another just with silicon
00:39:55,00:40:01,valley tech billionaires one who's i'm not sure if he's a billionaire but steve wozniak the creator
00:40:01,00:40:08,of the apple computer with steve jobs so he used to have a phone number which was very similar to
00:40:08,00:40:14,panam's reservation number and people in silicon valley if they failed to use the right area code
00:40:15,00:40:20,they would get steve wozniak instead who loved pranks we've spoken about before on the podcast
00:40:20,00:40:24,and so he would play up to it and what he used to do is if someone was trying to make a reservation
00:40:24,00:40:31,he would tell them that they were the millionth passenger on panam and as a result they'd won
00:40:31,00:40:36,free lifetime travel on panam and then what he would do is halfway through collecting their
00:40:36,00:40:41,personal information he would hang up leave them confused and the obviously thing would be they would
00:40:41,00:40:45,spend the next however long calling panam back going no i swear to god someone was offering me
00:40:45,00:40:53,lifetime i'm a millionth guy harsh real harsh really cruel such a dick move in 2015 there was
00:40:53,00:40:58,a woman called betty barker who got a phone call and she picked up the phone and the person said
00:40:58,00:41:06,hello is this planet earth and so she thought that's a prank call or this person's drunk
00:41:06,00:41:11,and the phone call ended i actually i don't i think either the person cut it off or she cut
00:41:11,00:41:17,it off and it only came to light the next day i think when tim peak tweeted from the international
00:41:17,00:41:21,space station i'm so sorry for the wrong month number i called yesterday from space i was trying
00:41:21,00:41:28,to get through to my family that's so good isn't that great our similar story our friend poli adams
00:41:28,00:41:32,got a call from the international space station one day so she's the daughter of
00:41:32,00:41:37,douglas adams and it was the 42nd mission to the international space station so 42 is a big
00:41:37,00:41:41,number in hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy so the whole mission was themed to that so poli was
00:41:41,00:41:47,told that she was going to receive a call from the astronauts but um her phone when the when it rang
00:41:47,00:41:52,had a area code of texas america which is where it's rooted from and she thought well that's not
00:41:52,00:41:57,space so she let it go to voicemail it called a couple of times what did she think the area
00:41:57,00:42:04,code of space was going to be she i don't know it might have just said space or universe um so she
00:42:04,00:42:09,ended up having to receive a voicemail going hi poli um it's just the astronauts up in the
00:42:09,00:42:20,international space station trying to get through to you if you could give us a call back okay it
00:42:20,00:42:26,is time for our final fact of the show and that is andy my fact is that halfway through the first
00:42:26,00:42:31,world war the british government bought nearly 400 pubs in an attempt to stop people drinking
00:42:31,00:42:37,how was that helping surely that just gives the members of parliament way more options
00:42:37,00:42:44,and what did they just close the pubs are they didn't close them they they close some of them um
00:42:44,00:42:49,but actually a large number of them were not only kept open they were substantially modified um
00:42:49,00:42:53,basically they were very worried about people going to the pub and how this might affect the
00:42:53,00:42:59,war effort because there were lots of factories making munitions uh where you had workers turning
00:42:59,00:43:03,up either hungover or maybe still drunk but it was it was a real problem especially if you're
00:43:03,00:43:08,making very delicate uh bombs and things like that bombs aren't delicate you know what i mean high
00:43:08,00:43:12,explosive devices there's probably some delicate parts of a bomb they probably are aren't they yeah
00:43:12,00:43:21,yeah the embroidery on top actually it's very hard to get that right okay um and so they they
00:43:21,00:43:26,really were concerned about this and as an experiment in june 1916 kind of the height of
00:43:26,00:43:32,the war it's really crazy to imagine but they bought nearly 400 pubs over an area of about 300
00:43:32,00:43:37,square miles uh quite near the city of carlyle it was called the carlyle experiment this this
00:43:37,00:43:41,campaign they bought some more elsewhere but that was the main area and they said we're going to do
00:43:41,00:43:47,it for as long as the war lasts and do you mean they sold them back afterwards or i think we get
00:43:47,00:43:51,onto that later but they initially just sort of bought them and said we have to do this and they
00:43:51,00:43:57,basically took all these actions to stop people drinking but in a pub environment so they brought
00:43:57,00:44:03,in really strict hours uh they encouraged the sales of food and non-alcoholic drinks uh they made it
00:44:03,00:44:06,more attractive to women and families they introduced table service you know all of these
00:44:06,00:44:13,moves were basically designed um to slow down drinking and make pubs nicer and my why is the
00:44:13,00:44:17,attractive to women and families going to slow down drinking i would have thought you're just
00:44:17,00:44:23,doubling your cleantel there very good point i guess it stops mad bingeing it stops like people
00:44:23,00:44:28,just going in just to drink isn't it like just drink those pubs right exactly yeah get on their
00:44:28,00:44:32,best behavior if only women had the same impact now when they walked into a pub suddenly everyone
00:44:32,00:44:36,is a complete gentleman insight into your childhood anna that you think children are part of the
00:44:36,00:44:43,drinking problem don't let them in they're out of control but it's basically gastropubs i think the
00:44:43,00:44:49,british government kind of invented the gastropub yeah it was called um disinterested management
00:44:49,00:44:55,wasn't it the um the idea where you would give your landlords big commissions if they sold soft
00:44:55,00:45:00,drinks or if they sold food um but you wouldn't really give them any commission if they sold alcohol
00:45:00,00:45:05,and it started the idea started with private temperance people started buying a few pubs to do
00:45:05,00:45:10,this and then the government thought oh that's a good idea right wait and we should say it it did
00:45:10,00:45:14,expand out of carlyle presumably or was it just the poor people of carlyle who couldn't get a drink
00:45:14,00:45:19,anywhere it was mostly carlyle i think i think it was across the country that the laws were passed
00:45:19,00:45:24,that limited things like ours right so you were only allowed to drink um between 12 and 2 or between
00:45:24,00:45:29,6 30 and 9 30 yeah it's interesting that they wanted to turn it so that more women and children
00:45:29,00:45:34,were going in because i did read that women were a big problem for the drinking in 1916 so there was
00:45:34,00:45:40,a magistrates that dealt with a case with a guy called captain oversby that said he said in the
00:45:40,00:45:44,opinion of the committee the great increase in the number of women visiting public houses during
00:45:44,00:45:50,the past year has demanded drastic treatment and they all wanted to put in place things like this
00:45:50,00:45:56,is the quote partitions snugs and other obstacles likely to facilitate secret drinking be done away
00:45:56,00:46:02,with so they women were just a big problem for the for the people of england apparently because
00:46:02,00:46:07,they kept going getting pissed at the park i think it was basically there was like these factions
00:46:07,00:46:12,wasn't there like a lot of people temperance was kind of a thing and um people were trying to stop
00:46:12,00:46:17,people from drinking in general and obviously the war helped that argument but then obviously a lot
00:46:17,00:46:23,of other people were thinking not so when um they decided that they would allow or try and get more
00:46:23,00:46:30,women into pubs there were 37 000 female signatories in birmingham of a petition demanding that women
00:46:30,00:46:35,not be allowed in pubs until a certain age yeah that's incredible wow keep women in the home
00:46:35,00:46:42,and out of the pubs there were lots of um changes that were made also two pub designs because there
00:46:42,00:46:48,were structural things in the building that you could do to slow down drinking bizarrely so pubs
00:46:48,00:46:54,used to consist of lots of little rooms and those were all done away with inside it became one large
00:46:54,00:46:59,space inside which could be more easily supervised so snugs that were you know potential for naughtiness
00:47:00,00:47:07,and and binge drinking and there were snob screens you know these no snob screen you will all have
00:47:07,00:47:14,seen one because it's this etched pane of glass right and um in some very old classic victorian
00:47:14,00:47:19,pubs you will still see them to this day and it basically is erected between two bits of a pub
00:47:19,00:47:23,you can see through it kind of one way the middle class drinkers have their own space
00:47:23,00:47:27,which you can kind of see through you can see through to the working class drinkers next door
00:47:27,00:47:32,but the working class drinkers can't see back at you and so it gets called a snob screen yeah and
00:47:32,00:47:36,those were done away with as well in loads and loads of pubs and they they've survived in some
00:47:36,00:47:41,there's one right by Oxford Circus which still has snob screens but we don't have snugs anymore
00:47:41,00:47:47,which is so sad I think you get you get a few snugs in Ireland still but they sound so great
00:47:47,00:47:51,sometimes the snugs could be entered just from the outside but you couldn't get into a snug from
00:47:51,00:47:56,inside the pub and these were like like Andy says they were for people who didn't want to be seen in
00:47:56,00:48:01,the pub so if you're quite a classy chap or women often like Dan said like women didn't want to be
00:48:01,00:48:06,known as drinkers so you enter a snug from outside sit in the snug no one in the pub can see you
00:48:06,00:48:11,and then the barman just has to wheel around a tray of drinks and then you pull it in through
00:48:11,00:48:20,like a little letterbox in your snug sounds really fun can I ask Andy these um snob screens in you
00:48:20,00:48:24,said there's a few in London I've been to I would say most of the pubs around Oxford Circus and I
00:48:24,00:48:30,never seen this does that mean that they've put me in the working class bit yeah and I just get
00:48:30,00:48:38,unaware of it or I've been breaking the code here forget everything I said James I don't think
00:48:38,00:48:44,any of them have them anymore okay I think I said before or maybe I didn't about how they made the
00:48:44,00:48:50,beer weaker obviously to stop drunkenness and there was a song by Weston and Lee in World War
00:48:50,00:48:55,one which was very popular because it was about this and some of the lyrics are really good so
00:48:55,00:49:02,have you read it seen what's said of it in the mirror and the mail it's a substitute and a pub
00:49:02,00:49:09,statute and it's known as the government ale and it goes on blah blah blah oh they say it's a terrible
00:49:09,00:49:15,war oh law and there never was a war like this before but the worst thing that ever happened in
00:49:15,00:49:22,this war is Lloyd George's beer so for some people the whole thing that was happening with the war
00:49:22,00:49:26,it was the weak beer that was the real killer I'm going to bet that those were two guys who
00:49:26,00:49:34,had not been to the front and beer never fully recovered after the war what do you mean it's
00:49:34,00:49:41,hardly remembered these days yeah it apparently after the war it was pretty much remained about
00:49:41,00:49:46,19 percent weaker so it used to be slightly stronger before the war and never quite climbed back up
00:49:46,00:49:50,there unless and obviously now we're in London you get all these Ponzi craft beers like last night
00:49:50,00:49:55,I was drinking a Ponzi beer I'd bought and I tasted a bit weird and I realized it was 11 percent
00:49:55,00:50:03,so we are gradually gradually recovering the percentages Jesus Christ but generally yeah
00:50:03,00:50:08,suffered there is a pub that I'd love for all of us to go to when we're back in pub land and then
00:50:10,00:50:16,it's the Dolphin Tavern and it's not far from our offices in Covent Garden it's up in Holburn
00:50:16,00:50:21,and the initial pub that was built on the site was bombed to the ground on the 8th of September
00:50:21,00:50:27,1915 and it was completely destroyed rubble everywhere and they decided to rebuild it so
00:50:27,00:50:32,in the process of moving away the rubble they discovered one of the remaining surviving things
00:50:32,00:50:39,was a clock that had stuck at 10 40 p.m the exact moment that the bomb was dropped and crashed down
00:50:39,00:50:44,on top of it and ruined everything and so the Dolphin pub to this day has that clock sitting
00:50:44,00:50:49,with the exact time that it was bombed in 1915 on the wall for you to see that's very clever
00:50:49,00:50:54,because also it always gives the impression that it's about to be last order yes oh Dan does it
00:50:54,00:50:59,have a snob screen if it has a snob screen I'll go well but then we won't get to hang out with James
00:50:59,00:51:08,I'll be by myself in the have you heard my accent I'm getting behind that snob screen
00:51:09,00:51:15,you'll be in the snug with the other women I'm afraid actually like it was until relatively
00:51:15,00:51:20,recently it was quite unusual for women to go to pubs especially drinkers pubs you wouldn't
00:51:20,00:51:26,see that that often and it was only the sex discrimination act of 1975 that meant a lot of
00:51:26,00:51:33,places would start allowing women and even there was a pub called the grill pub in Aberdeen that
00:51:33,00:51:39,famously had a sign outside that said no ladies please and wouldn't let any women in at all and
00:51:39,00:51:48,in 19 in fact it was in 1975 no it was in 1973 that a group of women ripped the sign off the door
00:51:48,00:51:54,and went into the pub and demanded to be served and the police had to come in and actually the I
00:51:54,00:51:58,think the police escorted them out of the premises but they refused to leave until they finished their
00:51:58,00:52:05,drinks and eventually obviously this act came in in 1975 so there was nothing they could do
00:52:05,00:52:11,they had to let these women in but they didn't install a female toilet until 1998 well I bet
00:52:11,00:52:16,they regretted that when the cleaner had to do a serious job on the floor every night
00:52:16,00:52:23,isn't that amazing there was a pub called El Vino which was a big journalists pub and there's a
00:52:23,00:52:27,book by Helen Lewis called difficult women which is all about history of feminism and the
00:52:27,00:52:32,opening of it is about the fight for women to get served at El Vino because you weren't allowed
00:52:32,00:52:38,to go to the bar as a woman and this was after the sex discrimination act this was in 1980 this
00:52:38,00:52:42,was in the early 80s so several years later and the courts were just not upholding it because they
00:52:42,00:52:48,said well this is too trivial to uphold or whatever and if you went in you weren't as a woman you
00:52:48,00:52:52,weren't supposed to wait at a table and the guys would go up to the counter that is true and it
00:52:52,00:52:58,was the early 80s like you say and a lot of places you'll see that will say on the internet that it
00:52:58,00:53:07,was still legal to not serve women in pubs until 1982 because it was this case when eventually it
00:53:07,00:53:12,was a solicitor called Tess Gill and a journalist called Anna Koot and they went to cart and they
00:53:12,00:53:17,won which meant that there was now a precedent there was already the law but now it was a precedent
00:53:17,00:53:21,which meant they had to be served they said that I think the pub management had justified it by
00:53:21,00:53:26,saying well look if you allow women to stand at the bar they're going to put their bags down
00:53:26,00:53:30,and that's going to create absolute chaos okay there'll be no room at the bar for people because
00:53:30,00:53:35,it's going to be full of bags and what Tess Gill genuinely that was their argument and what Tess
00:53:35,00:53:41,Gill and her colleague did was they got a couple of male friends to go in put their briefcases down
00:53:41,00:53:46,on the counter clearly taking up space when the pub was very empty so clearly that is a breach of
00:53:46,00:53:50,the rules that the pub is trying to say only applies to women and the men kind of gathered
00:53:50,00:53:55,evidence that way and that's one of the ways they won yeah wow so I actually think the greatest
00:53:55,00:54:02,contribution that Tess Gill and Anna Kootz made obviously women are allowed in all pubs now but
00:54:02,00:54:08,also I'm guessing those little hooks under the bar because of them too right oh yeah I can't tell
00:54:08,00:54:14,you how grateful I am for those hey Dan you asked earlier about what happened to the state management
00:54:14,00:54:18,scheme the Carlisle experiment you know because it was going to be for the duration of the war
00:54:18,00:54:25,plus one year afterwards right so that would have been 1919 they kept the pubs until 1973
00:54:25,00:54:30,that was when the last ones were sold off it was I know it was a serious success and I read a website
00:54:30,00:54:34,about the state management scheme the official name of it which asked why this thing lasts so long
00:54:34,00:54:40,there were two reasons it lasts so long number one it made a profit every year for the government it
00:54:40,00:54:45,was so profitable and number two the economic and political problems facing Britain in the
00:54:45,00:54:49,20s and 30s that ultimately led to the Second World War and the rebuilding problems in the 50s
00:54:49,00:54:54,and 60s were far more politically urgent than dealing with state management of pubs in Carlisle
00:54:54,00:54:59,I don't know if you guys have ever been out for a drink in the Carlisle area but I am not that
00:54:59,00:55:06,surprised that they did that but one of the other reasons is because at the start of World War One
00:55:06,00:55:12,there was a bit of a rise of Irish nationalism in Ireland and a lot of the workers who came over to
00:55:12,00:55:18,the munitions factories in Carlisle were Irish and there was a worry that if the rise in nationalism
00:55:18,00:55:23,in Ireland kind of spilled over to Carlisle it might not be just that they struggled to work
00:55:23,00:55:28,because they were hung over but also that it might cause like political discontent in that area
00:55:28,00:55:34,well speaking of Ireland we've made a big deal about British pubs but really we've got nothing
00:55:34,00:55:38,on Irish pubs they're they're the big global expert aren't they and I was wondering why it was like
00:55:38,00:55:43,when did they get so big how long have they been around I reckon they date back to the sixth century
00:55:43,00:55:49,which is quite a lot older than us but I think I've been to some Irish pubs with some old boys in
00:55:49,00:55:55,there that bit versus the sixth century um so in the sixth century there was a law pass that said
00:55:55,00:56:01,every single local king and there are about 140 in Ireland had to have their own personal brewer
00:56:01,00:56:07,and the brewer had to keep a never dry cauldron which basically and it was called like a brugu
00:56:07,00:56:13,that's amazing the cauldron by law had to serve free food free alcohol and free entertainment to
00:56:13,00:56:18,anyone who passed by just in case it was the king and there were loads of rules they had to be on
00:56:18,00:56:22,the crossroads they had to have torchbearers all around to give passers by a welcome and invite
00:56:22,00:56:28,them in whoa whoa it was so good and if you were caught running a brugu and you couldn't provide
00:56:28,00:56:35,free booze free food free whatever entertainment then by law the sort of state of the official
00:56:35,00:56:40,poet of the region had to write a satire about you a poetic satire to publicly humiliate you
00:56:40,00:56:48,so good oh my god hey just modern day london pubs again another one i'd love to go to is the grapes
00:56:48,00:56:55,in london which is well for one main reason they have a pub quiz there and sometimes it is supposedly
00:56:55,00:57:03,run by gandalf sree and mckellan what really yeah he he bought the pub yeah he owns a pub it's called
00:57:03,00:57:08,the grapes he bought it in 2012 and if you don't know the answer and you want to pass does he say
00:57:08,00:57:15,you shall not pass is that a joke about lord of the rings i don't know yes it is yeah god that's
00:57:15,00:57:20,like seeing someone score a basketball hoop while blindfolded considering you've never seen it yeah
00:57:20,00:57:24,it's like a lady from bristol on her first cold claw flight she doesn't know what she's doing
00:57:24,00:57:31,yeah it's he he does the hosting sometimes apparently he mentions it on his twitter occasionally
00:57:31,00:57:35,who loves pub quizzes come to our pub quiz let's do it but we won't be allowed to because james
00:57:35,00:57:40,will be running for making bad jokes that he doesn't even understand about lord of the rings
00:57:40,00:57:45,it's a hard pub quiz there are a lot of um shadow facts shadow facts is the name of your house
00:57:45,00:57:52,horse and fact it sounds a bit like facts see that shows true knowledge yeah weirdly though andy wouldn't
00:57:52,00:57:55,be allowed in for a very different reason which is that was just fucking weird i would say andy
00:57:55,00:58:00,wouldn't be allowed in because at the end i think you have to throw a ring into a volcano but andy
00:58:00,00:58:12,would have to get a seven-year-old german girl to do it for him okay that's it that is all of our
