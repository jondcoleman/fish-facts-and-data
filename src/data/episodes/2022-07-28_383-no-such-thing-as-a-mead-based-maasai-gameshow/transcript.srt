00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:20,000
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming to

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,000
 you from four undisclosed locations in the UK. My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here with

4
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,880
 James Harkin, Anna Tyshinski and Andrew Hunter Murray and once again we have gathered around

5
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:36,080
 the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days and in no particular order

6
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:42,880
 here we go. Starting with fact number one and that's my fact this week, my fact is that the

7
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:49,680
 world's longest golf putt took 26 seconds for the ball to reach the hole. In that time it covered

8
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:57,920
 a distance of over nine miles. So Dan, I've just done some calculations just before we came on

9
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:04,240
 and I reckon that means they must have hit the ball at about just over 1200 miles per hour.

10
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:08,720
 And is that good James? I know you play golf. Well I've just been watching the open just

11
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:13,520
 before we came on as well and Bryson DeChambeau who most people think hits it the hardest and

12
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:18,480
 fastest of anyone can hit it at a maximum of 140 miles an hour so what the fuck's going on?

13
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:25,040
 Okay so yes you are correct in your calculation but incorrect in how this record was set.

14
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:34,160
 This was set aboard Concorde. Yeah so it is a cheat. I was talking to our good buddy Jason

15
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:40,880
 Haisley and this came up in conversation. He mentioned that a record had been set by someone

16
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:46,640
 who had basically used the idea that the distance that you would travel on Concorde matched with

17
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:53,280
 a putt that could travel the distance of Concorde into a hole would set the record. So the record

18
00:01:53,280 --> 00:02:00,640
 that is held currently is by a guy called Jose Maria Olathalbo and he's a golfer who in 1999

19
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:05,920
 was on the Ryder Cup's team Concorde flight to the United States and during the whole trip he

20
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:12,080
 spent most of the time in the aisle trying to break the record for longest putt ever. Right.

21
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:18,640
 And so the putt that he achieved was 26.17 seconds long so it covered the 150 feet of the cabin

22
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:26,000
 but as a result of the distance traveled by Concorde that was 9.2 miles that he traveled.

23
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,440
 I can only imagine how hard it was for the poor bloody air stewards to serve the drinks

24
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:37,280
 around this golfer. The other thing is when you're playing golf it's always more difficult to play

25
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:43,840
 over water but presumably this whole shot was over water. Yes exactly but also you know I'd

26
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:48,720
 mention he tried to break the world record. This isn't the first time that someone has set the record

27
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:55,120
 of longest golf putt done on a Concorde airplane so a couple years before in 1997 there was a guy

28
00:02:55,120 --> 00:03:00,400
 called Brad Faxon and he set the record. Now what's interesting is I managed to find a blog

29
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:05,920
 about the story of how this happened and I think it's a cheat his record setting because

30
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:12,640
 as opposed to this other completely legitimate. Well as far as I can tell the current record

31
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:18,960
 holder did it by hitting it and getting it into the hole on his own but in this blog about Brad

32
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:23,280
 Faxon it sounds like he hit the ball and then all of the passengers were putting their hand

33
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:28,240
 and feet in the way navigating the ball. That doesn't count. Exactly that doesn't count.

34
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:36,080
 I have a question Dan. How did they make a hole in Concorde? In fact that made it easier to sink

35
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:40,560
 the ball because everything was being sucked towards the massive hole in the fuselage of the

36
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:45,440
 plane they just drilled. Is that what happened? No I think it must have been a cup on its side.

37
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:50,800
 For such an important record the scant detail. Such an important record.

38
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:57,360
 World changing record was set today. As far as I could tell the first person to ever hold the

39
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:03,440
 record was not a professional golfer but was Suggs from the band Madness who initially did it

40
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:07,520
 and what did you mean the longest putt or do you mean on Concorde? On Concorde the longest putt

41
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:12,880
 on Concorde. No wonder Concorde went out of business the number of golfers just queuing up

42
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:20,960
 taking up valuable spaces for people with their bags. The longest golf shot ever or what was often

43
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:25,680
 claimed or speculated to be one of the longest happened on the moon right? I think we've mentioned

44
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:30,960
 before Alan Shepard did a golf shot on the moon and it was it was never a record breaker or anything

45
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:35,120
 but everyone always just said god that must have gone miles because obviously gravity on the moon

46
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:40,800
 is a sixth of what it is now so you should be hitting it six times as far and there's the I

47
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:47,440
 think there's the footage and when he hit it this is on Apollo 14 1971 he missed it the first one

48
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:53,200
 which we've mentioned before hit the second and disappeared out of shot and he was like wow god

49
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:58,320
 I reckon that's gone a long way he actually said about 200 yards which still is not as far as

50
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:04,640
 professionals will hit it but they recently analyzed the videos of his golf shots and zoomed right in

51
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:10,080
 and they worked out where he was standing because they saw his footprints and where the ball landed

52
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:18,560
 and he hit the ball 40 yards which in earth yards I guess that would be what like seven

53
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:23,360
 seven yards he basically hit at the equivalent of on earth wow wow var has really ruined more

54
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:30,800
 things than we realized yeah as someone who once lost a cricket ball throwing competition

55
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:37,200
 aged about 15 or 16 to a seven-year-old girl I don't think we should criticize this guy too much

56
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:42,240
 but cricket ball throwing yeah it was a cricket ball throwing competition it was in Germany

57
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:47,760
 and why why were you representing the UK the world cricket ball throwing championships

58
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:55,760
 that's a fair point I guess they didn't have much interest from elsewhere yeah oh god amazing

59
00:05:55,760 --> 00:06:01,200
 anyway speaking of sport of the sports what sport do you reckon has the fastest ball of not being

60
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:09,360
 played on concord just generally what about squash squash faster for sure okay it's not going to be

61
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:15,280
 table tennis it's not ping-pong no the answer is pilota you know that game that they play in the

62
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:22,000
 catalan region of spain oh yeah yeah I'm so excited about the pilota world cup coming up soon well

63
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,960
 apparently you're representing the UK and that's all I think I don't know if you know it's basically

64
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:32,320
 a game where you you have these gloves but they have like a slope on them and so you catch the

65
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:37,760
 ball in midair it's a bit like squash and then you flick the ball using your hand and with this

66
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:42,960
 slope and it really gives it a massive speed but I thought that's about 180 miles an hour the best

67
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:49,840
 tennis serve about 160 I thought maybe quidditch but the quidditch broomsticks apparently according

68
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:55,040
 to the internet I haven't read the books at all so I might be wrong about this only 150 miles an hour

69
00:06:55,040 --> 00:07:02,240
 the fastest brooms go so my pedestrian sport really but then if you throw the um I want to say

70
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:08,640
 snitch from a broomstick no no no no no no come on let's throw the snitch come on come on a broomstick

71
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:13,840
 if you catch the snitch the game ends your team gets 150 points right sorry well you're throwing

72
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:20,240
 some sort of balls presumably you might throw a quaffle or a blusher it's a quaffle yeah right

73
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:24,800
 so you quiff the quaffle off the broomstick while going at 150 miles an hour you give that some

74
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:31,280
 extra speed yeah it's like shouting a torch out of a car exactly no hang on that's still the speed

75
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:37,920
 of light it's exactly unlike shouting a torch in actual fact you've chosen the one thing light

76
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:46,160
 which doesn't act like a ball you know a hole in one uh the phenomenon of a hole in one I did not

77
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:50,160
 know this you can get a hole in one insurance if you own a golf course what do you mean basically

78
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:54,960
 lots of golf courses offer prizes you know huge prizes if you got a hole in one on this hole

79
00:07:54,960 --> 00:08:00,080
 we will give you 50 000 pounds and that's obviously quite risky for a golf course in case someone just

80
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:06,160
 turns up and does it so there is special insurance and you pick a main hole and you can also get

81
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:11,200
 optional prize cover for five other holes in the policy I read I'm sure they vary but yeah I just

82
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:15,520
 had no idea that was a special insurer that's very cool yeah so you're um encouraged to get

83
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:20,800
 insurance if you play golf because you're hitting balls quite often in the wrong directions in areas

84
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:25,280
 where there are people but part of your insurance will often be hole in one insurance and that's

85
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:29,680
 because when you get a hole in one you're kind of supposed to buy everyone else in the club a drink

86
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:35,360
 and so if you do get it and you pay for that then your insurance will pay for that round of drinks

87
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:40,640
 really that's brilliant so that's kind of stingy isn't it people are saying even on that day when

88
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:44,000
 presumably they're winning this massive prize from the golf course anyway they're not going to buy

89
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,800
 the five other blokes in the golf bar a drink the poor people at Aviva who are dealing with two

90
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:52,640
 competing claims one for 50 000 pounds for one for the biggest round of drinks ever

91
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:59,520
 wow that's amazing well you say things golf balls often do get hit in the wrong direction

92
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:04,320
 right and one particular group of people who is prone to doing this are American politicians

93
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:11,600
 so i think maybe the record for the most disastrous misdirected hit is held by Spiro Agnew

94
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:17,120
 so this was 1971 i think so he was former former vice president this is thank you i was going to

95
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:21,680
 say just for the just for the younger listeners he explains who Spiro Agnew is

96
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:29,200
 come on if you've heard his name once which you probably have you never forget that name

97
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:36,320
 so no one needs to contextualize it's the bob hope classic tournament in 1971 this is like a lot of

98
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:41,360
 celebrities took part in this a lot of presidents have played in it and i think he might be the

99
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:49,280
 only person to hit three people with two shots so he hit one shot and it hit a husband and wife

100
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:55,600
 couple both so rebounded off one smacked into the other he paused went up to apologize how embarrassing

101
00:09:55,600 --> 00:10:00,560
 for me i'm a public figure went back down put it back on the tee and thwacked another woman

102
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:06,240
 who had to go to hospital no my god yeah did he then continue oh yeah he absolutely nailed it

103
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:11,360
 after that you get your bad shots out the way that's amazing and i think was he working with

104
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:17,200
 Gerald Ford he was at the time wasn't he who also once hit the same woman twice from the same tee

105
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:24,320
 you're kidding did she move did she move in between shots one and two that's a really good question

106
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:27,280
 in which case you think it's her fault because obviously he's not going to hit it to the same

107
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:31,120
 place i don't think i'm sorry i don't think i'm saying it's her fault i'm just saying it would

108
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:36,400
 be interesting if she moved and that implies that he was drawn towards her somehow okay i guess if

109
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:41,520
 she didn't it also could imply that she could have been wearing like a giant flag on her head

110
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:47,440
 yeah he thought she was the whole she was actually she had an enormous hole um in the middle of her

111
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:55,760
 diaphragm okay oh that's who you guys know who the number one female golfer in the world is at

112
00:10:55,760 --> 00:11:01,520
 the moment type of recording no no come on guys it's not sexist because i don't know the number

113
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:06,400
 i don't know either yeah fair enough the number one female golfer is a woman called Nelly Corder

114
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:14,080
 the number 13 golfer is her sister Jessica Corder and you might know the name if you follow

115
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:20,320
 tennis because their brother is Sebastian Corder who is currently the 46th best player in the world

116
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:24,880
 and was the first player born in the 2000s to reach the fourth round of any grand slam event

117
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:30,400
 wow imagine that family the father is Pettacorder who was a former number two tennis player in the

118
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:37,440
 world and an Australian open winner and their mother is Regina Corder Ney Reichstover who

119
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:42,880
 was a former tennis top 30 player as well wow imagine that family at Christmas their grandfather

120
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:50,560
 was Concorda who invented it shall we talk about concord yeah yeah concord was absolutely amazing

121
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:57,200
 it says kind of sad that it's defunct i i love the fact that i had a wiggly nose yeah which i didn't

122
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:02,000
 really know because you see photos of it looking slightly skew if the nose they could genuinely

123
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,680
 from the cockpit control where the nose was and it was simply so they could see the runway because

124
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:10,400
 when the nose was in its up up position the pilots coming into land couldn't see the runway nearly

125
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:16,080
 as clearly obviously advantage to see the runway so they just had a boom and you could see it tilt

126
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:19,760
 down and they could see the runway at land and it made that noise didn't it yes absolutely it's probably

127
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:26,880
 noise yeah oh i've just lost my sex drive sound effect do you guys know the oldest person ever

128
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:35,760
 to fly on concord um gosh i don't was it um what who's old you do you mean old now because all of

129
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:40,080
 them are fairly old well that's a good point yeah okay i'm gonna say this is a trick question

130
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:45,920
 i reckon your like a mummy was transported from ancient egypt or something like that's classic

131
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:53,360
 and oh it's bound to be that what a great lucy the ancestor of all the um homoerectasis yeah

132
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:58,560
 some primordial soup was brought on board and served would you like the chicken or the fish or

133
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:07,280
 the primordial soup poor andy he now just has to tell us it's a 61 that is very true well there's

134
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:11,120
 been a few all these on there the queen mum celebrated her 85th birthday by going on concord

135
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:14,960
 and sitting in the cockpit she's not the oldest person ever the oldest person ever was a woman

136
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:23,520
 called eve woodman okay she flew on concord in 1998 and she was aged 105 born in 1893 and what

137
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:28,080
 i really like is this when she went on the flight it was only the second time in her life she had

138
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:36,160
 left bristol wow isn't that incredible that's amazing did honor waiting for the right moment

139
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:39,600
 she would have been 11 years old at the time of the first flight of the right brothers

140
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:43,280
 she was born at a time when cars were pretty bloody surprising

141
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:50,720
 that's true concord was maybe not used to transport mummies but concord was used to transport body

142
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:56,880
 parts which i didn't realize so the actual speed of concord had served a genuine purpose medical

143
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:01,360
 purpose and apparently ba concords were quite often used to transport organs that needed to be

144
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:08,000
 quickly relayed to somewhere else to be donated and there was one incident according to concord

145
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:13,840
 magazine where french concord had to ship a really rare anti-venom to someone who'd had a snakebite

146
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:19,520
 somewhere in africa oh my god and yeah and and because you've got such limited time it was

147
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:23,760
 literally like if they'd just gone aboard a normal ba flight then wouldn't have made it in time but

148
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:28,480
 the person survived because it whizzed over there so fast but concord doesn't fly to africa does it

149
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:32,800
 well i think i suppose it flies to wherever the person gets bitten by the snake if it's

150
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:39,440
 it probably wasn't a scheduled flight is what i'm saying do you mind if you could get him from

151
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:45,440
 sudan to amsterdam then yeah we'll give him the antebellum no i think it diverted paul mccarney

152
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:50,960
 once ordered a pizza to be flown from new york to london by concord yeah i don't get that i i

153
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:55,920
 i'm trying to find out more about that was it a cooked pizza was it like a sainsbury's it would

154
00:14:55,920 --> 00:15:01,200
 be cold wouldn't it it would be i think it was from his favorite pizza place hmm i you'd imagine

155
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:06,720
 it would be rather he wouldn't have got it from dominos in new york if there's dominos in london

156
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:11,200
 would he he might have had vouchers for the one in london that he couldn't trade in in new york

157
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:18,960
 well yeah was he misled as to how fast concord was it is possible if your delivery arrives after

158
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:23,440
 two and a half three hours it is still going to be lukewarm at best i wonder if the pizza got its

159
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:29,280
 own seat and stuff i wonder that i do wonder that um i would like to think it did there was

160
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:33,040
 a thing where you could save money by being a courier and so if there were sensitive documents

161
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:36,880
 that had to be delivered you would get a cheaper ticket on concord so maybe the pizza had its own

162
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:41,760
 special courier yeah that's interesting i imagine if the pizza just comes out at the other end and

163
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:48,400
 there's a guy with a sign which just has a pizza on it there were quite a lot of famous people that

164
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:54,000
 did travel concord that have led to stories like this like phil collins famously with live aid

165
00:15:54,000 --> 00:16:00,720
 played in london and was able to fly to america to play for the end of the day uh over there and

166
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:06,160
 there's a story of urie galler being on the plane and he visits he visits the captain in the cockpit

167
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:11,040
 get get him out of here he's going to bend everything in sight interestingly the nose was

168
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:19,200
 completely straight until he got him he went into the flight deck and he said i can spin the compass

169
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:24,880
 on your instruments and thanks urie thanks a lot fucking don't yeah because presumably he's doing it

170
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:30,000
 with a hidden like um you know magnet or something right it's got to be a trick so why are you letting

171
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,480
 him on with that exactly so the captain said i thought at 37 kilometers a minute are we being

172
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:40,480
 wise to allow this man to fiddle with the navigation and he did he let him he let him do it um i think

173
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:45,840
 though he did it on the standby compass which is still you need it it's a standby compass sure and

174
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:50,720
 he said sure enough it whizzed around i've never seen anything like it and uh when it stopped i'm

175
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:54,880
 pleased to say it went back to show it accurately where we were going what a surprise just like what

176
00:16:54,880 --> 00:17:07,680
 would happen if you bugged it there yeah exactly okay it is time for fact number two and that is

177
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:12,640
 Anna my fact this week is that some fish use sharks as scratching posts

178
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:20,960
 brave fish yeah and also like my cat uses scratching posts to kind of get her nails down

179
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:26,480
 and fish don't have nails so what's going on oh yeah what's no but they do have parasites

180
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:31,520
 and so they like to rub themselves off against rough surfaces to get rid of those or scratch

181
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:36,080
 that itch and the adrenaline junkies among them scratch up against sharks and this has been

182
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:40,320
 documented in lots of places underwater so i first read about it there's a photographer who

183
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:46,400
 spotted a crowd of jack kind of fish enveloping a massive bull shark and found out later this is

184
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:51,680
 what they do they rub up against them and it seems to happen everywhere so i found a picture of

185
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:57,680
 mackerel rubbing up against a great white very bold very bold and uh even sharks rubbing up

186
00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:02,080
 against other sharks sometimes there are silky sharks rubbing up against whale sharks to scratch

187
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:08,320
 themselves wow so it must be harsh to like sharks it's not their fault they got this rough skin and

188
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:13,520
 they've just become kind of everyone's using them right and they're so rough aren't they i i didn't

189
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:18,080
 really realize this because i've never obviously touched a shark but um shark for example can

190
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:23,200
 destroy human skin with their own skin so sometimes people who try to rescue sharks

191
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:28,320
 which have washed up on land uh if they handle them they end up with shark burn where basically

192
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:34,320
 their skin is just so rough that they destroy your fingers in your hands yeah wow what like classic

193
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:38,960
 gray smooth sharks because that just looks like that's such a smooth surface the amazing thing

194
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:43,520
 about them which is just so cool is they're basically made of loads of teeth aren't they

195
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:49,120
 so their skin is loads of these tiny tiny teeth called dermal denticles and if you zoom in they do

196
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:56,240
 look like kind of layers of oval overlapping teeth and they literally are jaws they are very nice

197
00:18:56,240 --> 00:19:03,280
 they're entirely and they're as hard as granite um and as strong as steel and they're made of

198
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:12,400
 material called appetite oh wow and also here's a thing um sharks do lose their appetite sometimes

199
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:18,000
 because they get dandruff which means bits of their skins the dermal denticles kind of fall off

200
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:24,080
 and what's really useful about that is we can go into the bottom of the sea and find these

201
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:29,200
 bits of shark dandruff and it can tell us quite a lot about the number of sharks that lived in an

202
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:33,360
 area over many men because it doesn't it's really hard stuff it doesn't really degrade very much

203
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:38,560
 so it's all there from hundreds and hundreds and thousands and millions and years of wow it's really

204
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:43,120
 helpful if you're looking after coral reefs for instance you can work out how many um sharks

205
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:48,320
 were there how a stick the water was all that kind of stuff and people are using this shark dandruff

206
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:54,960
 to do that oh so cool that's amazing the shark that was mentioned in this article was a bull shark

207
00:19:54,960 --> 00:20:00,800
 and bull sharks very fascinating sharks they have this incredible ability to swim in both salt and

208
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:07,440
 freshwater uh so do i so do i yeah hi uh yeah sorry let me let me rephrase that they can live

209
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:14,160
 underwater in salt or fresh water those things and um as a result these sharks can be found in

210
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:20,400
 really odd spots and one place in particular that bull sharks are found in is a place called

211
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:26,880
 carbrook golf course in queensland where following a flood where the golf course was flooded bull

212
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:32,480
 sharks swam into the local lake that's in the golf course and then stayed there once the flooding

213
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:38,000
 went down so they're permanently there these giant bull sharks as part of the the golf course

214
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,400
 someone's got to break that putting record by putting it onto the back of a shark which swims

215
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:49,040
 the entire length of the lake deposits on the other side whale sharks that's a kind of shark

216
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:56,560
 they're absolutely huge they have remora on them the sucking parasitic creatures but they make a

217
00:20:56,560 --> 00:21:04,640
 lovely meal these remoras for birds however how do you get from the bird to the shark underwater

218
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:09,840
 it's really cool what they do is there's only one bit of scientific footage of this happening i believe

219
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:16,480
 the cormorants will dive bomb into the water they will swim down once they're underwater

220
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:20,480
 and then once they get to the surface of the whale shark they will peck away at the remora on the

221
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:25,280
 surface basically try to chisel it off because it's stuck on you know with really strong adhesive

222
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:30,560
 and pry it away from the surface of the whale and they do this you know losing oxygen all the time and

223
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:34,240
 then swim back up and they got there they got the meal the remora are amazing aren't they when you

224
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:38,960
 see have you seen photos of them this little suction pad i've never heard remora i must say

225
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:43,600
 i've never heard that so they're quite a big fish and they're they're different in say like pilot

226
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:48,880
 fish that pilot fish will swim alongside the shark and they will eat parasites along the way and

227
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:53,360
 clean up around them and hence the symbiotic relationship but the remora literally on the

228
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:59,200
 top of their head have this insane suction pad and they just rock up to the side of a shark

229
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:05,360
 and they just go and suck themselves on with their head the right way up and they just get free

230
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:09,840
 transport along the way and they're really important to some of these sharks to the point

231
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:15,040
 where the shark will put itself in danger to help the remora suck on but they live off shark poo

232
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:19,600
 don't they i think some of them they now think they thought they lived off like they feed off the

233
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:23,840
 parasites on the shark and live off sort of scraps of food falling out of the shark's mouth which is

234
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:29,840
 a kind of ignominious existence but now even worse they eat shark poo some of them we think and that's

235
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:34,880
 what they get there so it's no it's no kind of life because there are these fecal plumes that

236
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:40,720
 sharks produce and really big sharks produce thousands of liters in this plume you know it's

237
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:45,760
 30 feet across whale sharks they produce this huge great plume but if the shark is swimming i don't

238
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:51,200
 actually know how the remora manages to eat that maybe it detaches and swims around them yeah they

239
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:55,920
 detach i think they're they're only attached for great travel so they they travel and then they

240
00:22:55,920 --> 00:23:01,280
 pause and i think they disattach and eat you know they they parasites off their faces and so on and

241
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:04,640
 that's tough though that's like being driven to a restaurant you jump out the car but the car

242
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:09,680
 continues driving on and then you have to catch it up after your meal yeah it's like a drive-thru no

243
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:15,760
 not like a drive-thru no that's it unless your your parents hated you they drove you to the drive-thru

244
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:24,320
 and then just drove away i like it look it was a fun game and it didn't do me any harm

245
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:30,480
 i grew up well adjusted um greenland sharks you know we've mentioned those guys before the

246
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:37,600
 really slow swimming dance favorite shark yeah they are often partially or completely blind

247
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:43,120
 because they have these copepods which are tiny crustacean like creatures attached to their eyes

248
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:47,200
 but the great news for the greenland shark is that they're swimming in such deep water

249
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:53,280
 that the sharks don't care because it's so dark that they don't actually need their eyesight very

250
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:59,760
 much well but there's also a theory which is not yet proved but that the copepod might be

251
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:07,680
 bi-luminescent and because of that it's attracting prey towards the greenland shark which travels

252
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:12,880
 at one mile an hour it's the slowest shark in the world top speed is two miles like we could

253
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:18,480
 out swim this shark basically so in the greenland shark version of jaws the music doesn't speed up

254
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:27,440
 at all it just stays forever exactly and so the idea is that the copepods are attracting prey to

255
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:33,920
 eat that and it's basically bringing food to the face of the greenland shark nice so it's again

256
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:39,440
 symbiotic is the theory because what that makes sense because i've read recently that 90 percent

257
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:45,760
 of creatures in the ocean are glow-in-the-dark a bioluminescent and we and they're just sort of

258
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:50,000
 discovering this and realizing all these all these animals deep sea animals that are glow-in-the-dark

259
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:55,600
 lantern sharks they glow i think they're luminescent underneath and so that if you look at them

260
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:59,520
 from underneath it looks like it's just the bright sky and you don't realize that there's a shark

261
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:05,120
 there's camouflage yeah that's weird having a light that is also camouflage that's clever yeah

262
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:09,920
 if you lived in blackpool with all the illuminations and you wanted to kind of camouflage

263
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:14,240
 yourself there then it would make sense to cover yourself in lots of bright lights right absolutely

264
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:18,000
 it all depends where you live no no completely but what a terrifying

265
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:23,360
 version of a serial killer you've just thought of James who goes around covered in christmas lights

266
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:25,360
 but only in blackpool

267
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:35,360
 we've never talked about the shark murder case in sydney which just feels like if people don't

268
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:40,560
 know about that you need to because it's such a good story this is basically 1935 there's an

269
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:45,920
 aquarium in sydney there's a tiger shark there are loads of people admiring it and suddenly it

270
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:53,040
 vomits up a human arm and this thank you good sound effects and this launched this massive

271
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:58,240
 murder investigation so it was an arm which when they studied it it obviously been cut off

272
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:03,600
 by someone as opposed to eating by the shark it had a tattoo on it which was identified as the

273
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:08,400
 arm of this kind of boxer cum criminal it actually turned out the shark hadn't eaten the arm the shark

274
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:15,120
 had eaten a smaller shark and that smaller shark had eaten the arm wow what a tangled web this is

275
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:20,240
 this is incredible wow it was awesome it's never been solved to this day this crime because this

276
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:26,480
 guy got accused uh this guy called reginald holmes and he denied it all he got really really drunk

277
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:30,480
 and got his boat out into sydney harbour i think he tried to shoot himself in the head to get away

278
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:36,560
 from the um accusation but instead the bullet flattened against his skull knocked him into the

279
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:42,160
 water whoa did he have a skull made of iron or what like how does that work what the hell i don't

280
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:46,480
 know what reginald holmes is made of but this bullet was flat and his skull was fine he got a

281
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:53,760
 mark and cushion what he climbed back into against his skull a lot of this story was

282
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:59,520
 unbelievable that put that bit in particular so okay so he's in the water he's got a bullet made

283
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:05,120
 of jelly yeah and he's got his skull made of iron and he climbs back into his speed boat and there's

284
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:09,920
 a police chase around sydney harbour which lasts for a few hours and eventually i'm amazed that it

285
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:14,800
 lasts a few hours given that he's been shot in the head by himself shortly before this he's hard

286
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:22,000
 cool maybe he's that guy from james bond with the metal face anyway jules yeah jules yeah the other

287
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:27,680
 jules so then he says okay fine i am involved he says his business associate had killed the victim

288
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:34,080
 this guy called smith and had dismembered him cut him into pieces and he turned up at reginald holmes's

289
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:39,520
 door because they had beef between them and he'd waved this severed arm at him and said look if

290
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:43,680
 you don't do what i need you to do then you'll end up like whoever this guy was and he'd left the

291
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:48,720
 severed arm with reginald holmes so holmes just tossed this arm into the water didn't really know

292
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:54,560
 what to do with it and anyway then he was murdered the day before he was supposed to testify and the

293
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:59,520
 case was never solved because even though they kind of knew it was the guy who holmes had said it

294
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:04,320
 probably was it was determined that no one could prove anyone had been murdered because actually

295
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:09,200
 a severed arm does not constitute enough of a body to suggest that anyone's been killed in the first

296
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:13,680
 place the threshold of proving a murder in australia seems to be remarkably high

297
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:28,560
 okay it is time for fact number three that is james okay in my fact this week is that 46 percent

298
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:34,240
 of masai men have become friends with someone who got the wrong number and mistakenly called their

299
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:42,560
 phone how fat are their fingers how lonely are the masai more importantly if i get a wrong number i

300
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:47,440
 never try and befriend the person who's called me so i think i don't know anything about the

301
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:53,040
 mechanics of how they use their phones so i can only answer andy's question really but basically

302
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:59,280
 the masai these are traditionally nomadic people but their lifestyle is evolving quite a lot

303
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:04,240
 like a lot of places around the world as the expansion of western society kind of globalizes

304
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:11,200
 itself and there was a 2021 study about masai men who live in kenya and tanzania and it found that

305
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:18,080
 because they work in big big areas and they don't see many people from day to day but it's really

306
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:23,280
 really important for them to have these social networks because it means that you can sell your

307
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:29,280
 goods better it's you know it's really important to kind of see people and speak to people they

308
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:34,720
 have found this way of making friends where whenever anyone accidentally calls them and they're

309
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:40,080
 speaking the ma language which is the language that they speak they automatically just start going

310
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:45,440
 oh how's it going i don't suppose you want to buy any cows or some grain or whatever i don't you know

311
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:50,880
 and they just basically start up a conversation so bizarre one of the mechanics for why they

312
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:56,160
 miss call sometimes is it's to do with the fact that there's not great access to electricity

313
00:29:56,160 --> 00:30:01,440
 in many areas and so if you were in an area and your phone died but you wanted to call someone

314
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:05,360
 you would borrow someone else's phone and in that case you'd have to manually put in a number off

315
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:10,480
 memory and it's during the memory of it you would miss dial i didn't see that that's really interesting

316
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:14,960
 i should say this is specifically men that they found this in there has been a study on

317
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:21,360
 masai women by a woman called kelly summers who comes from virginia tech and she found that the

318
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:26,320
 men are often using their phones to talk about people outside their social circle to try and make

319
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:31,600
 contacts for selling things especially um whereas the women are mostly talking to each other other

320
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:37,120
 people in the family unit in this in the local unit yeah so that's quite a gender line as far as

321
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:43,200
 mobile phone uses in the masai yeah there's another division that is being created in

322
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:50,240
 masai society not a serious division but according to a 2017 study people with mobile phones which

323
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:56,080
 are dumb you know non-internet enabled as it were they call smartphone users because they

324
00:30:56,080 --> 00:31:00,400
 have the ability to download weather forecasts and if you're nomadic or a cattle herder weather

325
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:05,600
 forecast is very important so this is basically a new system of being a tribal elder opening up

326
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:10,720
 which is you know have you got an iphone or the equivalent that's very funny wait so they just

327
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:14,720
 call they'll call loads of random numbers until someone picks up and they say hey are you on an

328
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:19,760
 iphone and then they say great can you tell me no they'll know if one specific person has an iphone

329
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:23,920
 they'll call them say can you download the latest weather forecast exactly yeah so that person's on

330
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:28,880
 the phone all day long basically just delivering the weather god it's like being a being a weather

331
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:33,200
 man or woman but instead of being on tv you just have to deliver the weather to every individual

332
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:39,360
 person yeah that's hot yeah it's like being the speaking clock isn't it really yeah yeah

333
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:46,480
 i'm never being so surprised when i was in kenya i went around kenya in tanzaneer in 2005

334
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:50,800
 and i was on like a matatu one of those buses and there was a big masai guy and it's so tall most

335
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:55,200
 of them sitting directly opposite me our knees were touching and i remember feeling kind of awkward

336
00:31:55,200 --> 00:32:00,560
 um and then he delved into his sort of coat and he whipped out a mobile phone and this was kind of

337
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:04,800
 when i just got a mobile phone that was when you finally decided to get one wasn't it Anna it was

338
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:12,160
 like you know what i thought yeah it is time but he was on a bus with you right yes like he's already

339
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:18,800
 engaged in the modern world well he's on a matatu going into town to sell some uh meat i guess

340
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:23,840
 did you have the meat with him uh yeah the rest of the passengers on the bus were all cows actually

341
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:29,840
 have you guys heard of the masai spitting customs again i don't know if these are now

342
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:34,080
 completely out of date and i suspect covid might have rendered them a little bit passive yeah it

343
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:38,720
 doesn't sound very covid friendly does it no there's lots of spitting belief it's a bit considered

344
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:44,560
 a blessing uh spitting so uh parents and friends might spit on a newborn baby to wish it luck

345
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:52,160
 and health that makes sense absolutely yeah during masai weddings a father might spit on his daughter's

346
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:58,640
 forehead and breasts as uh again as a as a blessing weird we're so weird to marry into that if you're

347
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:05,680
 not aware isn't it yeah i'd take that as an insult and they do the classic uh spit on your hand

348
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:10,640
 for a handshake as well which is often done as a sort of blood brothers with spit kind of thing

349
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:14,800
 you spit on your own hand so yeah you spit on your own hand and then shake uh but that's that seems

350
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:19,920
 to be a normal sort of handshake again as you say handy it might be out of date now but yeah

351
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:24,480
 yeah god i like the idea though that andy you would spit on someone else's hand in a spit shake

352
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:28,400
 i'm going to start suggesting that you hand out and you have to project sit onto their hand

353
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:36,400
 there was a traditional way of preparing mead in the masai uh and that was that a man and a woman

354
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:42,480
 would live in a hut and keep away from the rest of society while they're making the mead and while

355
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:47,840
 you're doing it you have to abstain from engaging in any sexual intercourse it lasts about six to

356
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:53,840
 seven days but if you don't follow that rule then it means that the mead will be undrinkable

357
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:57,040
 and all the bees who produce the honey will leave the village forever

358
00:33:57,040 --> 00:34:05,600
 imagine if you had broken the rules just nervously presenting your tainted mead to the rest of the

359
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:10,000
 tribe and seeing if they guess yeah i'm going hey where are those bees going no they're just

360
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:15,760
 popping out they're popping out that would be a great masai game show you know what the mead makers

361
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:21,440
 dirty mead yeah it's a panel of masai judges who have to work out whether the couple of mead

362
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:25,520
 makers have had sex during the production prices of the mead it's like anti love island basically

363
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:29,680
 we're just watching people try not have sex oh wait there is a new network show

364
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:36,000
 i believe is that is that that's the premise is it yeah yeah well you're not allowed to have sex

365
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:40,480
 right to protect the mead it's not they've actually they've cut the mead element from the

366
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:45,360
 netflix show which i think is a huge blunder big mistake big mistake how's that gonna work

367
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:49,040
 i mean i hope they haven't cast long married couples because that's just the girl for years

368
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:56,960
 and not be a challenge for anyone the masai have now created their own intellectual property trust

369
00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:01,920
 because they're so second tired of big global companies using the name masai or using traditional

370
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:08,000
 masai designs and so they are creating a body of intellectual property trained elders and they hope

371
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:11,840
 that they'll be able to negotiate with firms on behalf of the masai obviously it's tricky because

372
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:15,600
 you've got lots and lots of people who are you know very dispersed and it's hard to negotiate on

373
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:22,160
 behalf of all the masai but they are trying to persuade firms to recognize the masai trademark

374
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:27,200
 over their own name for example yeah because isn't there an estimate that over a thousand companies

375
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:33,040
 use masai designs basically it's that sort of red check right and the beads you see those beads

376
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:39,440
 everywhere belts and so like louis viton calvin kline yeah and obviously it's hard it's hard to

377
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:44,400
 trademark beads for example but particular designs you might be able to or there are sometimes

378
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:49,360
 voluntary codes of conduct which some native american groups have struck so that now it's

379
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:53,200
 seen as an industry standard that if you use and guess you have to kind of get permission or or at

380
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:57,200
 least talk to the people involved and there is somewhere you can go which has been the first

381
00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:03,280
 company to start paying them for their trademark called koi clothing so ko y which i was looking at

382
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:09,920
 and the items for humans are very expensive but you can get a dog collar for 25 pounds so

383
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:18,480
 some stuff on wrong numbers oh yeah yeah elon musk has an old phone number which he doesn't

384
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:25,680
 use anymore but which lindsay tucker 25 year old skin care consultant does use oh no so she

385
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:32,960
 regularly gets phone calls and text messages for elon musk one guy sent her a blueprint for a bionic

386
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:39,600
 limb another guy in south africa have sent her a text message asking if he can buy 1000 trucks

387
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:49,600
 and the irs called her asking about her tax amazing what did you say her job is she is a skin care

388
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:54,400
 consultant oh well so that first one sounds quite useful what was the first call bionic limb that's

389
00:36:54,400 --> 00:37:03,680
 the one place you don't need skin care you need just the wd 40 yeah look if you if you get something

390
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:08,000
 you say i'll try to fix your skin your cold soles on your leg and then it's like i've really screwed

391
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:13,040
 that up i'm so sorry i had to amputate but on the bright side got a bionic limb i can see how that

392
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:16,720
 would look it's unlikely yeah god it must be tempting some of the offers she gets she must be

393
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:21,360
 really tempted to pretend to be his representative i'm sure she'll be caught pretty quickly but

394
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:27,680
 according to the article i read she takes it in in her stride and she says that um if any of you

395
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:32,640
 ever call elon musk or text him and you don't get a reply then don't feel hard done so you probably

396
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:37,440
 rang her number and she doesn't get a chance to reply to everyone saying it's that so it's not

397
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:44,560
 elon's fault and but it was it was npr and they did ask elon musk about it and he did say that

398
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:50,000
 that was his number he can't believe that it's still in use it's so old that's amazing she should

399
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:57,600
 start selling musk oh that's such a good idea great idea capitalize on it start selling elon's musk

400
00:37:57,600 --> 00:38:05,680
 the skin does he have that as a perfume company elon's musk he must do right he should he must

401
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:09,600
 defeat i mean the exciting thing here at her is we could literally call this lady up and you

402
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:15,040
 picture the idea right let's do it we've got her number no no the number wasn't printed at the

403
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:19,680
 story because that would just make matters worse yeah it would be irresponsible journalism yeah

404
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:24,880
 this person gets loads and loads of dodgy calls but here's her number anyway he just gets she needs

405
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:30,480
 to know do you guys want to hear the greatest wrong number of all time yeah in my opinion okay

406
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:38,480
 it happened in 1992 it was happened in dover there was a man called jason pegler he was walking

407
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:45,760
 past a phone box right and it rang he answered the phone and the person ringing that phone box

408
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:50,800
 wanted to speak to him the person making the call was a colleague of his who was ringing trying to

409
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:57,280
 get through to jason asking how to work the office fax machine they hadn't phoned his phone number though

410
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:01,440
 they had accidentally looked up his sheet at the company and phoned his employee number at the

411
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:07,840
 company which happened to be the same as the number for the phone box and was he able to help out

412
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:14,960
 with the fax situation i don't know you bastard i have no idea that isn't it i mean do you do you

413
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:19,440
 buy this because it does sound unbelievable well yeah you're absolutely right it does sound

414
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:24,640
 unbelievable it's collected by david spiegelhalter of cambridge university who has a website where he

415
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:29,760
 collects unbelievable coincidences and this is one of them so i don't know what verification

416
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:34,800
 he does but i think it might um i think it might be true actually i think it is legit i think i've

417
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:39,680
 heard him be asked about it before the guy who answered the phone i bet he was loitering outside

418
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:45,680
 that phone because he spotted that years earlier i suppose it's like the law of big numbers isn't

419
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:50,480
 it you have enough billion people in the world and enough things happen that eventually more of them

420
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:55,600
 will be an amazing coincidence exactly that it's exactly that i found another just with silicon

421
00:39:55,600 --> 00:40:01,840
 valley tech billionaires one who's i'm not sure if he's a billionaire but steve wozniak the creator

422
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:08,320
 of the apple computer with steve jobs so he used to have a phone number which was very similar to

423
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:14,640
 panam's reservation number and people in silicon valley if they failed to use the right area code

424
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:20,640
 they would get steve wozniak instead who loved pranks we've spoken about before on the podcast

425
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:24,960
 and so he would play up to it and what he used to do is if someone was trying to make a reservation

426
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:31,040
 he would tell them that they were the millionth passenger on panam and as a result they'd won

427
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:36,160
 free lifetime travel on panam and then what he would do is halfway through collecting their

428
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:41,040
 personal information he would hang up leave them confused and the obviously thing would be they would

429
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:45,440
 spend the next however long calling panam back going no i swear to god someone was offering me

430
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:53,040
 lifetime i'm a millionth guy harsh real harsh really cruel such a dick move in 2015 there was

431
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:58,720
 a woman called betty barker who got a phone call and she picked up the phone and the person said

432
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:06,720
 hello is this planet earth and so she thought that's a prank call or this person's drunk

433
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:11,040
 and the phone call ended i actually i don't i think either the person cut it off or she cut

434
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:17,040
 it off and it only came to light the next day i think when tim peak tweeted from the international

435
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:21,840
 space station i'm so sorry for the wrong month number i called yesterday from space i was trying

436
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:28,080
 to get through to my family that's so good isn't that great our similar story our friend poli adams

437
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:32,160
 got a call from the international space station one day so she's the daughter of

438
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:37,200
 douglas adams and it was the 42nd mission to the international space station so 42 is a big

439
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:41,680
 number in hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy so the whole mission was themed to that so poli was

440
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:47,760
 told that she was going to receive a call from the astronauts but um her phone when the when it rang

441
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:52,720
 had a area code of texas america which is where it's rooted from and she thought well that's not

442
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:57,440
 space so she let it go to voicemail it called a couple of times what did she think the area

443
00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:04,640
 code of space was going to be she i don't know it might have just said space or universe um so she

444
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:09,520
 ended up having to receive a voicemail going hi poli um it's just the astronauts up in the

445
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:20,320
 international space station trying to get through to you if you could give us a call back okay it

446
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:26,240
 is time for our final fact of the show and that is andy my fact is that halfway through the first

447
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:31,840
 world war the british government bought nearly 400 pubs in an attempt to stop people drinking

448
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:37,680
 how was that helping surely that just gives the members of parliament way more options

449
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:44,160
 and what did they just close the pubs are they didn't close them they they close some of them um

450
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:49,680
 but actually a large number of them were not only kept open they were substantially modified um

451
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:53,440
 basically they were very worried about people going to the pub and how this might affect the

452
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:59,200
 war effort because there were lots of factories making munitions uh where you had workers turning

453
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:03,520
 up either hungover or maybe still drunk but it was it was a real problem especially if you're

454
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:08,080
 making very delicate uh bombs and things like that bombs aren't delicate you know what i mean high

455
00:43:08,080 --> 00:43:12,880
 explosive devices there's probably some delicate parts of a bomb they probably are aren't they yeah

456
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:21,120
 yeah the embroidery on top actually it's very hard to get that right okay um and so they they

457
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:26,240
 really were concerned about this and as an experiment in june 1916 kind of the height of

458
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:32,080
 the war it's really crazy to imagine but they bought nearly 400 pubs over an area of about 300

459
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:37,520
 square miles uh quite near the city of carlyle it was called the carlyle experiment this this

460
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:41,360
 campaign they bought some more elsewhere but that was the main area and they said we're going to do

461
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:47,440
 it for as long as the war lasts and do you mean they sold them back afterwards or i think we get

462
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:51,440
 onto that later but they initially just sort of bought them and said we have to do this and they

463
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:57,360
 basically took all these actions to stop people drinking but in a pub environment so they brought

464
00:43:57,360 --> 00:44:03,120
 in really strict hours uh they encouraged the sales of food and non-alcoholic drinks uh they made it

465
00:44:03,120 --> 00:44:06,720
 more attractive to women and families they introduced table service you know all of these

466
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:13,280
 moves were basically designed um to slow down drinking and make pubs nicer and my why is the

467
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:17,040
 attractive to women and families going to slow down drinking i would have thought you're just

468
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:23,760
 doubling your cleantel there very good point i guess it stops mad bingeing it stops like people

469
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:28,400
 just going in just to drink isn't it like just drink those pubs right exactly yeah get on their

470
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:32,560
 best behavior if only women had the same impact now when they walked into a pub suddenly everyone

471
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:36,960
 is a complete gentleman insight into your childhood anna that you think children are part of the

472
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:43,600
 drinking problem don't let them in they're out of control but it's basically gastropubs i think the

473
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:49,520
 british government kind of invented the gastropub yeah it was called um disinterested management

474
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:55,120
 wasn't it the um the idea where you would give your landlords big commissions if they sold soft

475
00:44:55,120 --> 00:45:00,000
 drinks or if they sold food um but you wouldn't really give them any commission if they sold alcohol

476
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:05,120
 and it started the idea started with private temperance people started buying a few pubs to do

477
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:10,160
 this and then the government thought oh that's a good idea right wait and we should say it it did

478
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:14,240
 expand out of carlyle presumably or was it just the poor people of carlyle who couldn't get a drink

479
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:19,040
 anywhere it was mostly carlyle i think i think it was across the country that the laws were passed

480
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:24,560
 that limited things like ours right so you were only allowed to drink um between 12 and 2 or between

481
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:29,120
 6 30 and 9 30 yeah it's interesting that they wanted to turn it so that more women and children

482
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:34,720
 were going in because i did read that women were a big problem for the drinking in 1916 so there was

483
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:40,400
 a magistrates that dealt with a case with a guy called captain oversby that said he said in the

484
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:44,480
 opinion of the committee the great increase in the number of women visiting public houses during

485
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:50,320
 the past year has demanded drastic treatment and they all wanted to put in place things like this

486
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:56,640
 is the quote partitions snugs and other obstacles likely to facilitate secret drinking be done away

487
00:45:56,640 --> 00:46:02,960
 with so they women were just a big problem for the for the people of england apparently because

488
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:07,200
 they kept going getting pissed at the park i think it was basically there was like these factions

489
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:12,720
 wasn't there like a lot of people temperance was kind of a thing and um people were trying to stop

490
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:17,600
 people from drinking in general and obviously the war helped that argument but then obviously a lot

491
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:23,440
 of other people were thinking not so when um they decided that they would allow or try and get more

492
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:30,560
 women into pubs there were 37 000 female signatories in birmingham of a petition demanding that women

493
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:35,760
 not be allowed in pubs until a certain age yeah that's incredible wow keep women in the home

494
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:42,320
 and out of the pubs there were lots of um changes that were made also two pub designs because there

495
00:46:42,320 --> 00:46:48,560
 were structural things in the building that you could do to slow down drinking bizarrely so pubs

496
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:54,560
 used to consist of lots of little rooms and those were all done away with inside it became one large

497
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:59,840
 space inside which could be more easily supervised so snugs that were you know potential for naughtiness

498
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:07,120
 and and binge drinking and there were snob screens you know these no snob screen you will all have

499
00:47:07,120 --> 00:47:14,480
 seen one because it's this etched pane of glass right and um in some very old classic victorian

500
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:19,520
 pubs you will still see them to this day and it basically is erected between two bits of a pub

501
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:23,520
 you can see through it kind of one way the middle class drinkers have their own space

502
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:27,840
 which you can kind of see through you can see through to the working class drinkers next door

503
00:47:27,840 --> 00:47:32,880
 but the working class drinkers can't see back at you and so it gets called a snob screen yeah and

504
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:36,880
 those were done away with as well in loads and loads of pubs and they they've survived in some

505
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:41,040
 there's one right by Oxford Circus which still has snob screens but we don't have snugs anymore

506
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:47,040
 which is so sad I think you get you get a few snugs in Ireland still but they sound so great

507
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:51,840
 sometimes the snugs could be entered just from the outside but you couldn't get into a snug from

508
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:56,000
 inside the pub and these were like like Andy says they were for people who didn't want to be seen in

509
00:47:56,000 --> 00:48:01,440
 the pub so if you're quite a classy chap or women often like Dan said like women didn't want to be

510
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:06,880
 known as drinkers so you enter a snug from outside sit in the snug no one in the pub can see you

511
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:11,040
 and then the barman just has to wheel around a tray of drinks and then you pull it in through

512
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:20,320
 like a little letterbox in your snug sounds really fun can I ask Andy these um snob screens in you

513
00:48:20,320 --> 00:48:24,800
 said there's a few in London I've been to I would say most of the pubs around Oxford Circus and I

514
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:30,400
 never seen this does that mean that they've put me in the working class bit yeah and I just get

515
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:38,160
 unaware of it or I've been breaking the code here forget everything I said James I don't think

516
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:44,560
 any of them have them anymore okay I think I said before or maybe I didn't about how they made the

517
00:48:44,560 --> 00:48:50,560
 beer weaker obviously to stop drunkenness and there was a song by Weston and Lee in World War

518
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:55,600
 one which was very popular because it was about this and some of the lyrics are really good so

519
00:48:55,600 --> 00:49:02,000
 have you read it seen what's said of it in the mirror and the mail it's a substitute and a pub

520
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:09,280
 statute and it's known as the government ale and it goes on blah blah blah oh they say it's a terrible

521
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:15,440
 war oh law and there never was a war like this before but the worst thing that ever happened in

522
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:22,480
 this war is Lloyd George's beer so for some people the whole thing that was happening with the war

523
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:26,400
 it was the weak beer that was the real killer I'm going to bet that those were two guys who

524
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:34,400
 had not been to the front and beer never fully recovered after the war what do you mean it's

525
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:41,520
 hardly remembered these days yeah it apparently after the war it was pretty much remained about

526
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:46,240
 19 percent weaker so it used to be slightly stronger before the war and never quite climbed back up

527
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:50,960
 there unless and obviously now we're in London you get all these Ponzi craft beers like last night

528
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:55,760
 I was drinking a Ponzi beer I'd bought and I tasted a bit weird and I realized it was 11 percent

529
00:49:55,760 --> 00:50:03,840
 so we are gradually gradually recovering the percentages Jesus Christ but generally yeah

530
00:50:03,840 --> 00:50:08,960
 suffered there is a pub that I'd love for all of us to go to when we're back in pub land and then

531
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:16,320
 it's the Dolphin Tavern and it's not far from our offices in Covent Garden it's up in Holburn

532
00:50:16,320 --> 00:50:21,280
 and the initial pub that was built on the site was bombed to the ground on the 8th of September

533
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:27,360
 1915 and it was completely destroyed rubble everywhere and they decided to rebuild it so

534
00:50:27,360 --> 00:50:32,240
 in the process of moving away the rubble they discovered one of the remaining surviving things

535
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:39,680
 was a clock that had stuck at 10 40 p.m the exact moment that the bomb was dropped and crashed down

536
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:44,880
 on top of it and ruined everything and so the Dolphin pub to this day has that clock sitting

537
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:49,520
 with the exact time that it was bombed in 1915 on the wall for you to see that's very clever

538
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:54,480
 because also it always gives the impression that it's about to be last order yes oh Dan does it

539
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:59,680
 have a snob screen if it has a snob screen I'll go well but then we won't get to hang out with James

540
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:08,880
 I'll be by myself in the have you heard my accent I'm getting behind that snob screen

541
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:15,600
 you'll be in the snug with the other women I'm afraid actually like it was until relatively

542
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:20,320
 recently it was quite unusual for women to go to pubs especially drinkers pubs you wouldn't

543
00:51:20,320 --> 00:51:26,160
 see that that often and it was only the sex discrimination act of 1975 that meant a lot of

544
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:33,440
 places would start allowing women and even there was a pub called the grill pub in Aberdeen that

545
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:39,760
 famously had a sign outside that said no ladies please and wouldn't let any women in at all and

546
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:48,800
 in 19 in fact it was in 1975 no it was in 1973 that a group of women ripped the sign off the door

547
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:54,240
 and went into the pub and demanded to be served and the police had to come in and actually the I

548
00:51:54,240 --> 00:51:58,880
 think the police escorted them out of the premises but they refused to leave until they finished their

549
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:05,440
 drinks and eventually obviously this act came in in 1975 so there was nothing they could do

550
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:11,600
 they had to let these women in but they didn't install a female toilet until 1998 well I bet

551
00:52:11,600 --> 00:52:16,160
 they regretted that when the cleaner had to do a serious job on the floor every night

552
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:23,600
 isn't that amazing there was a pub called El Vino which was a big journalists pub and there's a

553
00:52:23,600 --> 00:52:27,920
 book by Helen Lewis called difficult women which is all about history of feminism and the

554
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:32,720
 opening of it is about the fight for women to get served at El Vino because you weren't allowed

555
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:38,640
 to go to the bar as a woman and this was after the sex discrimination act this was in 1980 this

556
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:42,880
 was in the early 80s so several years later and the courts were just not upholding it because they

557
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:48,000
 said well this is too trivial to uphold or whatever and if you went in you weren't as a woman you

558
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:52,320
 weren't supposed to wait at a table and the guys would go up to the counter that is true and it

559
00:52:52,320 --> 00:52:58,480
 was the early 80s like you say and a lot of places you'll see that will say on the internet that it

560
00:52:58,480 --> 00:53:07,040
 was still legal to not serve women in pubs until 1982 because it was this case when eventually it

561
00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:12,640
 was a solicitor called Tess Gill and a journalist called Anna Koot and they went to cart and they

562
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:17,200
 won which meant that there was now a precedent there was already the law but now it was a precedent

563
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:21,760
 which meant they had to be served they said that I think the pub management had justified it by

564
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:26,240
 saying well look if you allow women to stand at the bar they're going to put their bags down

565
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:30,480
 and that's going to create absolute chaos okay there'll be no room at the bar for people because

566
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:35,760
 it's going to be full of bags and what Tess Gill genuinely that was their argument and what Tess

567
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:41,440
 Gill and her colleague did was they got a couple of male friends to go in put their briefcases down

568
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:46,560
 on the counter clearly taking up space when the pub was very empty so clearly that is a breach of

569
00:53:46,560 --> 00:53:50,960
 the rules that the pub is trying to say only applies to women and the men kind of gathered

570
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:55,760
 evidence that way and that's one of the ways they won yeah wow so I actually think the greatest

571
00:53:55,760 --> 00:54:02,320
 contribution that Tess Gill and Anna Kootz made obviously women are allowed in all pubs now but

572
00:54:02,320 --> 00:54:08,800
 also I'm guessing those little hooks under the bar because of them too right oh yeah I can't tell

573
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:14,640
 you how grateful I am for those hey Dan you asked earlier about what happened to the state management

574
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:18,240
 scheme the Carlisle experiment you know because it was going to be for the duration of the war

575
00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:25,040
 plus one year afterwards right so that would have been 1919 they kept the pubs until 1973

576
00:54:25,040 --> 00:54:30,240
 that was when the last ones were sold off it was I know it was a serious success and I read a website

577
00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:34,720
 about the state management scheme the official name of it which asked why this thing lasts so long

578
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:40,400
 there were two reasons it lasts so long number one it made a profit every year for the government it

579
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:45,760
 was so profitable and number two the economic and political problems facing Britain in the

580
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:49,920
 20s and 30s that ultimately led to the Second World War and the rebuilding problems in the 50s

581
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:54,720
 and 60s were far more politically urgent than dealing with state management of pubs in Carlisle

582
00:54:54,720 --> 00:54:59,360
 I don't know if you guys have ever been out for a drink in the Carlisle area but I am not that

583
00:54:59,360 --> 00:55:06,160
 surprised that they did that but one of the other reasons is because at the start of World War One

584
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:12,240
 there was a bit of a rise of Irish nationalism in Ireland and a lot of the workers who came over to

585
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:18,240
 the munitions factories in Carlisle were Irish and there was a worry that if the rise in nationalism

586
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:23,520
 in Ireland kind of spilled over to Carlisle it might not be just that they struggled to work

587
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:28,560
 because they were hung over but also that it might cause like political discontent in that area

588
00:55:28,560 --> 00:55:34,080
 well speaking of Ireland we've made a big deal about British pubs but really we've got nothing

589
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:38,720
 on Irish pubs they're they're the big global expert aren't they and I was wondering why it was like

590
00:55:38,720 --> 00:55:43,280
 when did they get so big how long have they been around I reckon they date back to the sixth century

591
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:49,200
 which is quite a lot older than us but I think I've been to some Irish pubs with some old boys in

592
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:55,600
 there that bit versus the sixth century um so in the sixth century there was a law pass that said

593
00:55:55,600 --> 00:56:01,120
 every single local king and there are about 140 in Ireland had to have their own personal brewer

594
00:56:01,120 --> 00:56:07,040
 and the brewer had to keep a never dry cauldron which basically and it was called like a brugu

595
00:56:07,040 --> 00:56:13,120
 that's amazing the cauldron by law had to serve free food free alcohol and free entertainment to

596
00:56:13,120 --> 00:56:18,160
 anyone who passed by just in case it was the king and there were loads of rules they had to be on

597
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:22,640
 the crossroads they had to have torchbearers all around to give passers by a welcome and invite

598
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:28,960
 them in whoa whoa it was so good and if you were caught running a brugu and you couldn't provide

599
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:35,280
 free booze free food free whatever entertainment then by law the sort of state of the official

600
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:40,720
 poet of the region had to write a satire about you a poetic satire to publicly humiliate you

601
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:48,320
 so good oh my god hey just modern day london pubs again another one i'd love to go to is the grapes

602
00:56:48,320 --> 00:56:55,520
 in london which is well for one main reason they have a pub quiz there and sometimes it is supposedly

603
00:56:55,520 --> 00:57:03,200
 run by gandalf sree and mckellan what really yeah he he bought the pub yeah he owns a pub it's called

604
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:08,240
 the grapes he bought it in 2012 and if you don't know the answer and you want to pass does he say

605
00:57:08,240 --> 00:57:15,840
 you shall not pass is that a joke about lord of the rings i don't know yes it is yeah god that's

606
00:57:15,840 --> 00:57:20,640
 like seeing someone score a basketball hoop while blindfolded considering you've never seen it yeah

607
00:57:20,640 --> 00:57:24,160
 it's like a lady from bristol on her first cold claw flight she doesn't know what she's doing

608
00:57:24,160 --> 00:57:31,280
 yeah it's he he does the hosting sometimes apparently he mentions it on his twitter occasionally

609
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:35,520
 who loves pub quizzes come to our pub quiz let's do it but we won't be allowed to because james

610
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:40,160
 will be running for making bad jokes that he doesn't even understand about lord of the rings

611
00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:45,760
 it's a hard pub quiz there are a lot of um shadow facts shadow facts is the name of your house

612
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:52,080
 horse and fact it sounds a bit like facts see that shows true knowledge yeah weirdly though andy wouldn't

613
00:57:52,080 --> 00:57:55,840
 be allowed in for a very different reason which is that was just fucking weird i would say andy

614
00:57:55,840 --> 00:58:00,320
 wouldn't be allowed in because at the end i think you have to throw a ring into a volcano but andy

615
00:58:00,320 --> 00:58:12,480
 would have to get a seven-year-old german girl to do it for him okay that's it that is all of our
