 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming

3
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:22,240
 to you from the QI offices in Covent Garden.

4
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:26,080
 My name is Dan Schreiber, I'm sitting here with Andrew Hunter Murray, James Harkin and

5
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:30,480
 Anna Tyshinski and once again, we have gathered round the microphones with our four favorite

6
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:35,920
 facts from the last seven days and in no particular order, here we go.

7
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:39,520
 Starting with fact number one and that is Anna.

8
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:44,880
 My fact this week is that pedestrians used to be expected to give way to sedan chairs.

9
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:45,880
 Oh wow.

10
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:48,480
 So they're the e-scooters of their day.

11
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:51,520
 They couldn't have been more so from everything I've read about them.

12
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:54,840
 A pedestrian is still expected to give way to sedan chairs but there aren't any sedan

13
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:55,840
 chairs so it doesn't matter.

14
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:56,840
 Oh like legally.

15
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:57,840
 It's a really good question.

16
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:01,180
 We'll have to, I guess we have to set it up with one of us, well it would require three

17
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:04,720
 of us to have a sedan chair and then one of us to find a policeman to arrest him.

18
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:08,240
 Well no, no, we only need one sedan chair and two people to lift it.

19
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:09,240
 We need three people.

20
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:10,240
 Yeah, that's what I mean.

21
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:11,240
 Three people.

22
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:12,240
 I thought you said a sedan chair each.

23
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:13,240
 No, no, no.

24
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:15,560
 So we'll need three people, one sedan chair and then one of us to be the pedestrian who

25
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:16,560
 doesn't give way.

26
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:17,560
 Oh well I'll be the pedestrian, please.

27
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:18,560
 Can I be the person'sâ€¦

28
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,560
 I'll be in the chair, shotgun in the chair.

29
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:21,560
 Dang.

30
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:22,560
 All right, front, front.

31
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:23,560
 I got the front.

32
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:24,560
 Yes.

33
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,560
 What a joke.

34
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:27,560
 Sorry James.

35
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:28,560
 God.

36
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:33,200
 Anyway, this was the other rules of the road or in fact the rules of the pavement in the

37
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:37,600
 great sedan chair era, which is quite a short era really and just in case you're unfamiliar

38
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:42,480
 with the sedan concept, it's obviously a chair that one person is sitting on and then

39
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:46,560
 it's attached to sort of pole railings and those are held by one person at each end and

40
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,920
 you're walked around the street in this chair.

41
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:51,200
 And normally there's a box around the chair, we should say.

42
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,200
 Yeah.

43
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,920
 There's some rough and ready sedan chairs where it's literally just a chair and you're

44
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:55,920
 being carried.

45
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:56,920
 Really?

46
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:57,920
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

47
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:58,920
 You can't see that.

48
00:01:58,920 --> 00:01:59,920
 Very cheap fit for those.

49
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:04,680
 There were military sedan chairs or for expeditions and it's literally just a chair with some

50
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:05,680
 handles that fold out.

51
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:06,680
 Right.

52
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:07,680
 And that's it.

53
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,400
 You wouldn't have thought it was that useful in a sort of military assault, would you?

54
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,400
 It's no tank.

55
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,400
 The sedan chair.

56
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,400
 It's free.

57
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,400
 It's before the battle.

58
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,400
 Okay, right.

59
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,400
 You're in the chair.

60
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,400
 Galloping in on the sedan chair.

61
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:22,720
 Over the lip of a hill, thousands of sedan chairs.

62
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:27,960
 Anyway, yeah, there were quite strict rules about how they could be used.

63
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:34,240
 So it was in 1634, I think, that they really kicked off in the UK.

64
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:39,880
 They came over from Europe and a guy called Saunders Duncombe got a bunch of licenses

65
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:42,080
 to hire out some sedan chairs.

66
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:45,640
 And the great thing about them was they were allowed to go on the pavements, much like scooters

67
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:49,000
 and there's much like scooters, it's really irritated pedestrians.

68
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,560
 But the rule was that pedestrians had to get out the way and the men on this who would

69
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:57,120
 be carrying the sedan chairs and it was usually men, obviously, would just shout, you know,

70
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:01,960
 buy or leave as they approached or sometimes rude of things, according to some accounts.

71
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,560
 I thought that it was very polite.

72
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:07,560
 I thought a sedan chair would be making its way leisurely to you and they would say you'd

73
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:08,560
 pause.

74
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,560
 These guys were bolting down the street.

75
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:10,560
 Yeah.

76
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,560
 Really?

77
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,560
 Yeah, that's the thing.

78
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,800
 If you didn't move, you weren't sort of in a standoff.

79
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:14,800
 You were just mowed over.

80
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,320
 That's why I think like this was the rule.

81
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:20,120
 But it was kind of an unwritten rule, I reckon, right?

82
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:22,840
 Because and the reason it was unwritten was because if you didn't get out of the way,

83
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:23,840
 you would get smashed.

84
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:24,840
 Yeah.

85
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:25,840
 Yeah.

86
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:26,840
 They could be quite, quite violent.

87
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:30,280
 I always thought that sedan chairs were pretty much in the way that you might, if you're

88
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:33,480
 in London these days, you know, getting a rickshaw in the middle of the night.

89
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:37,340
 Like it was just a thing of convenience, which was really nice, but actually they were really

90
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:38,340
 practical.

91
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:42,920
 They were particularly practical for people whose legs, you know, had problems who couldn't

92
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:44,080
 walk and so on.

93
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,000
 And sedan chairs weren't just for the outside.

94
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,160
 You had indoor sedan chairs, which I just didn't think of.

95
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:53,280
 So you could get, you could get from your room downstairs and have a wash, go out.

96
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:56,280
 I think it was, it was usually the same sedan chair, right?

97
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:59,520
 What they would do is they would change the poles so they would have shorter poles when

98
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:03,520
 you were doing the indoor bits and then they would give you longer ones for the outdoor.

99
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:06,800
 So they were really popular in Bath in the city of Bath.

100
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:09,240
 They were, like Dan said, because you could use them indoors.

101
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:12,360
 You could literally be picked up from your bed in your lodgings.

102
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:15,000
 You could be carried to the bath waters, which were regenerative.

103
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,120
 You could be put into the waters and then picked back up again and taken back to your

104
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,720
 bed and put into your bed.

105
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:24,800
 And these guys, the chairman, who would take you, they would also strip you and cover you

106
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,120
 in blankets.

107
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:29,600
 So they would take off your nightclothes, put you in blankets, put you in the sedan chair,

108
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:33,280
 take you to the baths, put you in and then put you back as you were.

109
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,480
 It's like being a baby.

110
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,480
 Yeah.

111
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,480
 Basically, I'm being a...

112
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,480
 I just think Uber should bring this in.

113
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,480
 I don't want...

114
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:44,000
 I think workers' rights might have got to a place where we wouldn't be able to sit in

115
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
 the sedan chair anymore.

116
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
 Yeah.

117
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,640
 There's a bit like a hover wheel chair, isn't it?

118
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:48,640
 Like you're...

119
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:49,640
 Yeah.

120
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:50,640
 Did you think about it?

121
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:51,640
 It's like, you know...

122
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:52,640
 Hovering no wheels.

123
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:53,640
 Just like, you know, an old...

124
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:54,640
 An old...

125
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:55,640
 Like the concept.

126
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:56,640
 It's a hovering chair.

127
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:59,160
 If you imagine the men who are carrying you aren't there, then it is, isn't it?

128
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:00,160
 Yeah.

129
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,160
 Imagine they are the wheels.

130
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,160
 The men are the wheels.

131
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,160
 They were...

132
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,160
 So they were mostly for the higher society.

133
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,160
 Yes.

134
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:07,640
 Obviously, because you had to pay fares to ride in them.

135
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:10,960
 And so they had great fixtures, like they tended to have hinged roofs, especially as

136
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:16,360
 hairstyles got bigger so that people's hair, big hairstyles would fit out on top or headdresses

137
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,860
 or top hats.

138
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:21,280
 I saw a drawing as well, which, again, it's done in that style where you kind of wonder,

139
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,520
 is this being satirical or is this being real?

140
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:27,240
 But you can see the hinge on the top of the roof and this giant wig coming out.

141
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,920
 Now, obviously, one of the problems is if...

142
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:29,920
 What if it's raining?

143
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:30,920
 Or what if there's a light drizzle?

144
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,400
 You're obviously going to get your wig wet.

145
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:39,280
 So the person on behind, in James's position, they have on their back a sort of huge pole

146
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:42,960
 that comes up with an umbrella on the top and that then sits over.

147
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,360
 I think it's a satirical drawing, sadly.

148
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:48,800
 But it's kind of makes sense that you would do that, I would say.

149
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:49,800
 Yeah.

150
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:50,800
 Yeah.

151
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,040
 I think from the attitudes of the chairman that I can gather, their vibe would be, "Your

152
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:57,440
 hair can bloody well get wet, madam."

153
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,080
 So there was a thing as sedentary sickness.

154
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,080
 Oh, yeah.

155
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:06,040
 I think sedentaries were huge in China, too, and in Hong Kong as well.

156
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:10,040
 And sea sickness was known as sedentary sickness because that was the best example they had.

157
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:14,280
 I think more people might have experienced sedentaries than the ocean.

158
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:15,280
 No way.

159
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,280
 Yeah.

160
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:18,080
 So you went out to sea and you suffer from sedentary sickness.

161
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,080
 Oh, possible.

162
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,560
 I don't know if they called it that when they were at sea.

163
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,320
 Oh, I thought you were saying that was what they called sea sickness.

164
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:27,120
 I think if you're a salty old sea dog, you're probably still called it sea sickness.

165
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,120
 Yeah.

166
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:31,040
 But I think most people would have said, "Oh, I've got a sedentary sickness."

167
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:35,320
 Because it feels like I've been in a sedentary, if they had motion sickness.

168
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:39,240
 If they'd been on the waltzes or whatever, they would think of it as sedentary sickness.

169
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:46,640
 But cures included drinking the urine of young boys, which does seem to crop up quite a lot

170
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:47,640
 in ancient cures.

171
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:50,980
 Was that in, would you get a little vial of that in the sedentary?

172
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:51,980
 For a nice one.

173
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:52,980
 Just if you felt it coming on, yeah.

174
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:55,480
 Well, like when the Uber driver has a bottle of water in his back, you know, it's the classy

175
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,480
 one.

176
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,480
 Sedan lux.

177
00:06:57,480 --> 00:07:03,600
 Yeah, or bringing some earth from your kitchen floor for protection.

178
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:07,160
 Well, that was how they used to treat sea sickness, I think we've said before, right?

179
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:11,080
 Ah, so it must have been the urine of young boys for the sedentary only.

180
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:12,080
 Okay.

181
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:16,320
 Also, taxi drivers get annoyed if you get their cars dirty.

182
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:20,420
 So if you bring earth into a car, and similarly with the sedentary, they used to, they were

183
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:22,280
 able to charge passengers for any mess that was made.

184
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:26,440
 So I think if you dumped a bunch of earth in the chair, or if you drank some young boys

185
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:30,120
 urine, and then vomited it back up, but that's presumably fine.

186
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:34,300
 Because they're the ones who introduced the boys urine into the, yeah, just don't spill

187
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:35,300
 it.

188
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:39,200
 And I really like it how when it got to nighttime, the sedentary, the price would then double

189
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:41,240
 on top of all these other fees that you had.

190
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:42,240
 It would double.

191
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:47,080
 It kind of makes sense because you needed one extra member of the vehicle, as it were,

192
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:53,160
 which was the link boy who would be standing in front of the sedentary with a torch lighting

193
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:55,400
 the way like a big old headlight.

194
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:57,200
 You know, so cool.

195
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:01,000
 And it was, I read a thing about that was very dark and jolting in the sedan because

196
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,600
 there are these just slight gaps of light where the curtains are or whatever, or you

197
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,600
 see the torch.

198
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:09,560
 And at the end of the journey, the link boy would thrust their flombo into your trumpet

199
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,560
 shaped extinguisher.

200
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:11,560
 How cool is that?

201
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:12,560
 Yeah.

202
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,560
 That was if you paid extra though.

203
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:18,600
 And those extinguishers, you still see them in houses sometimes, don't you?

204
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:21,720
 I walked past the building yesterday and I saw this weird iron trumpet on the outside

205
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:25,160
 and it was for them to stick the torture and extinguish is it?

206
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,160
 That's great.

207
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,160
 Cool is that?

208
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:30,440
 If you ever need to put out a candle in London and you happen to be in the right place, you

209
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:31,440
 can do it.

210
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,440
 It's quite sushi buildings.

211
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:33,440
 It's not.

212
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,440
 Yes.

213
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:35,440
 This was in, you know, Piccadilly or somewhere.

214
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,440
 Yeah.

215
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:38,440
 If look, if you live in one of those buildings, you can probably afford a torch, so you won't

216
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:41,520
 need to put the candle out in there.

217
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:45,440
 The world record longest journey in a sedentary.

218
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,760
 I'm not sure if it's still the world record.

219
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:53,560
 But this was in 1728, it was Princess Amelia, who's the daughter of King George II.

220
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:58,940
 And she was carried from London to Bath in a sedentary.

221
00:08:58,940 --> 00:08:59,940
 So far.

222
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:00,940
 Wow.

223
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:01,940
 It's a long way.

224
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:05,000
 She must have got through so much young boys urine on the way.

225
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:10,160
 They have like service stations where you can get some young boys urine, some drive-throughs

226
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:14,000
 and stuff.

227
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:21,280
 It's 172 kilometres and she did it with eight chairmen working in turn and they had a coach

228
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:25,560
 that was going alongside him that they would jump in and out of and then they would carry

229
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:26,560
 her.

230
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:27,560
 Who was it?

231
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:28,560
 Who did this?

232
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:29,560
 Princess Amelia.

233
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:30,560
 So an actual princess.

234
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:31,560
 Yeah, daughter of George II.

235
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:32,560
 Wow.

236
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:33,560
 It wouldn't be your average pleb would it?

237
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:34,560
 No, no, of course.

238
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:38,440
 But what this reminds me of, every so often there's a new story today, which is like this

239
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:41,560
 drunk person got an Uber 200 miles.

240
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:47,360
 That was the first thing I thought I was like, but she was really kind of quite unpopular

241
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,760
 Princess Amelia.

242
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:52,640
 She famously closed Richmond Park to anyone apart from her friends.

243
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:53,640
 Bastard.

244
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:54,640
 In London.

245
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:59,840
 And so you had to get a ticket to go to Richmond Park and you had to get it from Princess Amelia.

246
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,680
 You couldn't get it from anywhere else.

247
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:07,320
 And so for instance, there was a guy called Lord Barock who asked her for a ticket and

248
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:09,440
 he said, "Can I have a ticket to Richmond Park?"

249
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:12,040
 And she said, "I denied one to the Lord Chancellor.

250
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:14,160
 I'm hardly going to give one to you."

251
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,160
 Ouch.

252
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:16,160
 Wow.

253
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,840
 It was like a huge sort of right to roam thing.

254
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:22,500
 And there was a guy called John Lewis who took her to court saying, "I should be allowed

255
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:24,240
 into Richmond Park."

256
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:28,120
 And in the end, this was in 1758, he won, John Lewis won.

257
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:32,280
 And so they had to put ladders up over the walls so that people could get into Richmond

258
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:33,280
 Park.

259
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:37,200
 But Princess Amelia made it so that the steps in the ladder were too far that people could

260
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,200
 get off.

261
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,200
 Oh no.

262
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,600
 So they had to go back to court to get them put in.

263
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,240
 How was she getting in?

264
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:48,080
 She was, you know, she had her gates that she could go into that would guard and stuff

265
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,080
 like that.

266
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,080
 Oh, I see.

267
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,080
 Okay.

268
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:54,480
 She didn't have a human trebuchet or something tossing her in the house.

269
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:58,520
 But yeah, John Lewis who did this, he became like a local celebrity and people who lived

270
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:03,000
 near Richmond Park would have his painting in their houses because he was so famous for

271
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,560
 getting people into Richmond Park.

272
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:05,560
 How cool is that?

273
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:06,560
 Yeah, Princess Amelia.

274
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:07,560
 Hang on.

275
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:11,040
 So could we say that without the sedanshire, we might not be able to access Richmond Park

276
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,040
 today?

277
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:13,040
 No.

278
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:16,240
 Well, it's another one of my talking about someone quite a long way from the actual

279
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,240
 fact.

280
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,240
 Yeah.

281
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,960
 I'm only talking about her because she did have the record for the longest sedanshire

282
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:21,960
 race.

283
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:25,240
 And just very quickly on the trip, you said that these guys were jumping out.

284
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:27,480
 So was it like passing a baton?

285
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:30,960
 As in, did she ever touch the ground, we know, or was it just one journey?

286
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,280
 That's a really good point.

287
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:34,640
 I would imagine, she's a princess, right?

288
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:38,200
 Do you reckon it's uncomfortable to be put down and picked up again?

289
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:42,280
 Because if it is, they probably did a pass, baton pass to try and make it as good as possible

290
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:43,280
 for her.

291
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:47,760
 But it's also uncomfortable to walk 170 miles without a piss.

292
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,840
 So I imagine she would have stopped the bet along the way.

293
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:50,840
 Yeah.

294
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:51,840
 There must have been.

295
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:52,840
 Yeah.

296
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:53,840
 Hardly any of them had toilets inside the sedanshire, did they?

297
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:54,840
 So...

298
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:57,440
 For that one, you would build that in, wouldn't you, for that long a journey?

299
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:01,120
 That's a rough gig for the guy at the back, is what I'm saying.

300
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,120
 Oh, no.

301
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:06,080
 What I'm thinking now is this is just so obvious that this must have happened.

302
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:11,760
 You get your free vial of young boys urine, neck it to make you feel better, and then

303
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:14,800
 you need a piss where you're going to go in that vial.

304
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:18,600
 And then the next person who uses the taxi, they're not going to get young boys urine.

305
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:19,600
 Yeah, you're right.

306
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:23,200
 And if they get the motion so it was badly, they'll think, "I bet that wasn't young

307
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:29,680
 boys urine, after all, only four stars."

308
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:39,000
 Okay, it is time for fact number two, and that is James.

309
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:45,880
 Okay, my fact this week is that a woman called Mary Papa Nicolaou once had a smear test

310
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:48,480
 every day for 21 years.

311
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:52,040
 I thought he's been a hypochondriac.

312
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:53,040
 That is...

313
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:55,720
 I mean, it's quite something, isn't it?

314
00:12:55,720 --> 00:13:03,320
 No, she was the wife of Dr. Georgios Papa Nicolaou, who was the guy who invented the

315
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:08,840
 PAP smear test, and that's why it's called the PAP test, because it's named after him.

316
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:14,120
 And he needed to do experiments, and it's kind of hard to get people to do experiments,

317
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:20,280
 and so he got his wife to do it, and she unbregrudgingly, or maybe a little bit begrudgingly, did this

318
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:21,280
 for 21 years.

319
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:27,500
 It depends on the day, doesn't it, if it's Christmas day, or your birthday.

320
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:33,640
 So the other thing is that he was a zoologist, really, and he came up with this idea of doing

321
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:41,520
 a smear of the vagina of a guinea pig, and he could find out when they were menstruating,

322
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:45,560
 and so he was kind of doing that experiment on humans, and everyone's like, "Yeah, but

323
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:48,360
 we kind of know when humans are menstruating, it's a bit dumb."

324
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:49,360
 But there is an obvious sign.

325
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:54,840
 There's the odd sign here and there, but what happened was Mary invited some of her friends

326
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:59,800
 to a party, and I don't know how you bring this up in the party, but as part of the party,

327
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:07,080
 they all had a smear test, and then one of her friends was diagnosed with cervical cancer,

328
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:12,240
 and Georgios Papa Nicolaou, he had the smear, and he managed to see that there was something

329
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:17,600
 in that smear that pre-saged the fact that she was going to get cervical cancer, and

330
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,200
 that was basically why we have smear tests today.

331
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,200
 So brilliant.

332
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,200
 What a hero.

333
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,200
 Like, he should be a household name, really.

334
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,200
 Well, she should be, as well.

335
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,200
 Both of them should be.

336
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,200
 Yeah, the Papa Nicolaou's should be.

337
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,200
 She should just lay there.

338
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:30,680
 As the only person among the four of us who's had a smear test, it's genuinely not that

339
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:31,680
 difficult.

340
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:32,680
 21 years in a row.

341
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:33,680
 It's not very pleasant.

342
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:34,680
 I understand.

343
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:35,680
 It's not that pleasant.

344
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:36,680
 No.

345
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:37,680
 So it's a sort of little, what is it about?

346
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:41,600
 A little sort of taking of a few cells from the inside of the vagina.

347
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:42,600
 Yeah, exactly.

348
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:43,600
 So it's something, a little speculum.

349
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,640
 I imagine, I really want to know who made the tiny speculum for this guy's guinea pig.

350
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:46,640
 I can tell you that.

351
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:52,140
 So he went to, he went to a shop and bought a nasal speculum for humans.

352
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:55,920
 So a speculum is something that kind of opens up a gap a little bit.

353
00:14:55,920 --> 00:15:00,360
 And so he would take the nasal speculum for humans and used it in the vaginas of the guinea

354
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:01,360
 pigs.

355
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:05,200
 And so what that tells me is that guinea pig's vagina is almost exactly the same size as

356
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,200
 a human nostril.

357
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,200
 Oh.

358
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:10,400
 Oh, well that's, it's useful knowledge probably somewhere.

359
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:12,200
 It's going to be useful at some point.

360
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,200
 One day.

361
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:14,200
 A pub quiz.

362
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,200
 What a pub quiz.

363
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,200
 The pub quiz as I go.

364
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,200
 The pub quiz as I set.

365
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,200
 Oh my God.

366
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,200
 I just can't see the sec.

367
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,200
 I want to.

368
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,200
 I've desperately tried.

369
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,200
 But we have a lot of listeners.

370
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:27,040
 There's like, how many people listening to this show?

371
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,040
 One day.

372
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:29,040
 Just a little bit.

373
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:33,400
 I reckon maybe you're going buying some nose plugs, right, as you're a swimmer and you

374
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:37,480
 go to the nose plug shop and they say, you're not allowed to put them in your nose before

375
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:38,480
 you buy them.

376
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:41,760
 And you're like, luckily I have a guinea pig here.

377
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:45,240
 So I can test the size of the guinea pig instead of testing it on myself.

378
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:47,120
 And that's the loophole in the chemist rule.

379
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:50,600
 We don't have any rule that says you can't put them in a guinea pig vagina.

380
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:55,120
 Oh, I've seen it where it's like someone's being held captive by an eccentric billionaire

381
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:59,480
 and they're like, I'm about to kill you unless you can answer this impossible question.

382
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:00,800
 That's quite good.

383
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:01,800
 I'll be.

384
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:02,800
 I've got another one.

385
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:08,760
 So you're being held captive by this guy and he wants to put some poison in your nose.

386
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:12,560
 And so what you do is, oh, no, I need to put my hockey mask on first and you put your hockey

387
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:13,560
 mask on.

388
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:16,720
 He begrudgingly says, oh, that's, I understand.

389
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:21,280
 But then when you've got your mask on, you put a guinea pig where he thinks your nose

390
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:22,280
 is.

391
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:26,320
 And so he puts the poison in the guinea pig's vagina instead of your nose because he fixes

392
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,320
 your nose.

393
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,320
 Yeah.

394
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,320
 That's quite good.

395
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:30,320
 Yeah.

396
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,320
 Anyway, look.

397
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:32,320
 God.

398
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,320
 Papa Niccolo.

399
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:34,320
 Yeah.

400
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:39,240
 So George asked the husband, he started working on the guinea pigs during the First World

401
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:44,040
 War, I think it was about 1916, maybe within a year or two either side because that was

402
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:45,920
 the length of the war.

403
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,160
 But it took him so long.

404
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:52,160
 He published his landmark work on it during the Second World War, it was 1943 that the

405
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:53,160
 work was published.

406
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:58,040
 And that was with a brilliantly named fellow scientist called Herbert Trout.

407
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:02,920
 Just on very quickly on Trout, Herbert Trout, because I know you want to know this.

408
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:05,120
 I read his obituary and he loved fishing.

409
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:06,120
 Brilliant.

410
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:07,120
 Lovely.

411
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:08,120
 Good on you.

412
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:09,120
 Very good.

413
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:11,960
 What is truly amazing about this though is one article that I read is that in the early

414
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:17,280
 1900s, cervical cancer was the number one cancer killer in women in the USA.

415
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:21,360
 And now it's basically the most preventable cancer up there.

416
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:29,880
 I mean, it's extraordinary what this guy's discovery along with his wife's vagina did.

417
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:37,240
 Another good name in the history of Smith's is the sort of simultaneous inventor, in fact,

418
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:38,240
 Oral Babes.

419
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,240
 Stop it.

420
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:40,240
 Yeah, stop it.

421
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,240
 That's not real.

422
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:43,240
 How do you actually pronounce it Anna?

423
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:44,240
 All right.

424
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:45,240
 Fine.

425
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:46,320
 I think you probably say Oral Babes.

426
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,320
 It's Oral Babesh.

427
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:54,200
 Oral Babesh is the name of the person who was Romanian I think and he also was doing experiments

428
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:58,760
 around the same time and sort of came up with a slightly different twist on taking a cervical

429
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:01,240
 smear test at the same time.

430
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:02,240
 Right.

431
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,240
 And yeah.

432
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:06,760
 And in fact, in Romania, it's called the method of Babesh of Papa Nicolaou.

433
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:07,760
 Wow.

434
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,440
 So they give him joint credit for it.

435
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:10,440
 Cool.

436
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:11,440
 He was, by the way, Babesh.

437
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:14,760
 He worked with Robert Bunsen of Bunsen burner fame.

438
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:15,760
 Stop.

439
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:16,760
 Yeah.

440
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:17,760
 Wow.

441
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:18,760
 He was his pupil.

442
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:20,320
 I thought Bunsen burner was kind of hundreds of years old.

443
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:23,280
 I thought they were back over a hundred years old.

444
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,280
 Okay.

445
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:25,280
 That is really cool.

446
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:26,280
 It's so cool.

447
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:27,280
 God, so many great names being chucked around.

448
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:28,280
 I know.

449
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:33,320
 In 2009, Papa Nicolaou at George else, again, was named the second greatest Greek of all

450
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:35,200
 time in a national poll.

451
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:39,200
 I mean, that's of all the countries, that's a biggie grease, isn't it?

452
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,560
 It's one hundred percent is because they got a lot of pedigree in there.

453
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:42,560
 Yeah.

454
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:44,360
 He was beaten by one man only.

455
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:46,480
 Was it that guy who did?

456
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:47,480
 Anassas.

457
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:48,480
 Not anassas.

458
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:49,480
 Oh.

459
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:53,940
 Well, who's that guy who did all the politics and the economics and stuff when they had

460
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:54,940
 a...

461
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:55,940
 Sure, it's like Socrates.

462
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:56,940
 Yeah.

463
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:57,940
 Was it him?

464
00:18:57,940 --> 00:18:58,940
 No.

465
00:18:58,940 --> 00:18:59,940
 I think it should be Anas, but I think it's Socrates.

466
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:00,940
 It's under the grade.

467
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:01,940
 Oh.

468
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:04,880
 The only Greek voted greater than George Papa Nicolaou.

469
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:07,360
 What did the Macedonians think of that vote?

470
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:09,360
 I don't know.

471
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:18,520
 I really love the speculum as said no woman ever as a historical object, I don't like

472
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:25,000
 it too near me, but it's got a very interesting history, so it was invented by this chap called

473
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
 James Sims.

474
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,820
 He was actually a very unsavory character in pretty much every way.

475
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:30,820
 Wow.

476
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:35,160
 At the time, doctors were totally discouraged from looking at women's private parts.

477
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:41,900
 Gynecologists would be told not to look at the affected area, and they'd be...

478
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:46,660
 They were instructed to blindly fumble around under a lady's skirt and have a little bit

479
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:51,500
 of a feel, and I think there was even a textbook that suggested either the doctors stare determinedly

480
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:56,500
 out into the middle of space or look the person in the eye consistently as you're doing it.

481
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:57,500
 Which is better.

482
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:59,500
 Which is worse.

483
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:04,960
 But, yeah, he didn't like doing it any more than any other of these male doctors at the

484
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:10,560
 time, and it was sort of as very unseemly, but he did say one time this poor girl came

485
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:13,960
 to him with a fissure, a really bad fissure, and he said this girl was in such a condition

486
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:17,200
 that I was obliged to find out what was the matter with her.

487
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:21,120
 And so we started investigating ways to see into the vagina, and he tried a bent handle

488
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:27,440
 of a gravy spoon at first, and I don't know if it was clean before it was eaten off again,

489
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:30,740
 not clear on the details there, but it was really controversial.

490
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:34,540
 Even after he came up with a speculum, lots of people refused to use it in case it corrupted

491
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:36,940
 people, in case women got very proud.

492
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:39,500
 In case it was just too damn sexy.

493
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:41,340
 It was exactly that.

494
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:45,580
 And the thing about Sims is really controversial is that he did a lot of experiments on African

495
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:50,980
 American enslaved women, and there was a question about how much consent he got.

496
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:54,840
 And to such an extent that his statue was removed from Central Park in 2018.

497
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:55,840
 Was it?

498
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:56,840
 Yeah, it was.

499
00:20:56,840 --> 00:21:00,600
 So, I mean, I think he's been roundly cancelled now, Mr Sims.

500
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:03,280
 Yeah, yeah, he's not a good guy.

501
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:08,720
 Another person famous in the history of smear tests is Anna Marion Hilliard.

502
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:14,720
 She was a Canadian physician, and the pap test was invented by this Greek guy, but actually

503
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:19,040
 she invented the way that they do it in modern days, because she made it much more simple,

504
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:23,160
 and she made it in a way that any gynecologist or family doctor could do it without having

505
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:24,660
 to have loads of extra training.

506
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:27,700
 So she's really, really important in this story.

507
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:29,880
 As well as being a physician, she was a midwife.

508
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:34,900
 She was one of the best women's hockey players in Canada in her day.

509
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:39,940
 And there was a brilliant interview with her, and they asked her about her life as a gynecologist.

510
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:44,780
 And she said that sometimes women would come up to her six years after their wedding day,

511
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:48,060
 and she would have to inform them that the reason that they still haven't had any babies

512
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:49,720
 is that they are still virgins.

513
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:50,720
 Whoa.

514
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:51,720
 Yeah.

515
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:53,360
 What is this?

516
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:55,120
 This was in the '50s.

517
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:56,760
 This interview was in 1957.

518
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:57,760
 Okay.

519
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:59,440
 They were like, "Why have I not had a baby yet?"

520
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:02,080
 And they're like, "Well, let me tell you something about life."

521
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:05,400
 That's leaving it too late for the birds and the bees chat, isn't it?

522
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,400
 Yeah.

523
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:10,080
 It's also very fitting that she played hockey, because in terms of gynecological lessons,

524
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:14,080
 I was taught to apply condoms by putting them on hockey sticks by my English teacher.

525
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:15,080
 Were you?

526
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:16,080
 Yeah.

527
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:18,300
 I was the first possible nod of my English teachers to this.

528
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:20,400
 Why is your English teacher telling you to do this?

529
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:23,300
 It comes up in middle-march, do you remember this?

530
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:26,360
 Dorothea has to pop, yeah, yeah, pop it on a hockey stick.

531
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:29,500
 Yeah, on Calzabon, it was quite difficult, because it was very fulfilling now.

532
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:31,800
 I thought, "Oh, no, I'm thinking of ice hockey sticks."

533
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:32,800
 A hockey stick?

534
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:33,800
 Which end is the hockey stick?

535
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:38,040
 I mean, isn't the hockey stick, like, 180 degrees curved at the end?

536
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:39,040
 Yeah.

537
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:40,040
 And the old pipey again?

538
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:41,040
 The gravy spoon.

539
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:42,040
 That's what we call it.

540
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:52,260
 Okay, it is time for fact number three, and that is my fact.

541
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:57,120
 My fact this week is that ships can squat to get under bridges.

542
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,240
 That's really cool.

543
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:01,320
 Pop a squat and get under bridges.

544
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:02,480
 They don't have any legs.

545
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:03,480
 They don't have any legs.

546
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:04,480
 Obvious response.

547
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:05,480
 No, they can't.

548
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:06,480
 What are you talking about?

549
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:07,920
 So this is a pretty amazing thing.

550
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:12,240
 Basically, what they do in order to achieve the squat is they make the ship go faster.

551
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:16,720
 And when you move a ship faster, there's obviously a lot more water passing faster.

552
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:21,320
 And when it passes faster, particularly underneath the boat, the pressure decreases.

553
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:25,600
 And so the ship sinks further down into it, sort of gets sucked to the bottom.

554
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,260
 And that's how they achieve it.

555
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:28,520
 And they work out the measurements.

556
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:32,540
 They work out how much they need to go down, and that's the speed to which they move in

557
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:35,960
 order to gain that extra distance from a bridge.

558
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:37,760
 And we've seen it happen a few times.

559
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:39,480
 I mean, it's pretty crazy.

560
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:41,840
 There's one of the biggest cruise ships in the world.

561
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:43,880
 It's called the Oasis of the Seas.

562
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:45,120
 And it needed to do this.

563
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:50,680
 It needed to get under a bridge that connects the Danish islands of Zeeland and Sprogo.

564
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:53,000
 So it couldn't get under at the height that it was at.

565
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,040
 And they did a few things like they had to collapse the tall standing funnels.

566
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:57,040
 What could you do that?

567
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:58,040
 Yeah, yeah.

568
00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:00,080
 Some ships are built to do that specifically for bridges.

569
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:01,080
 Yeah.

570
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:05,560
 I mean, but normally those ships are in bottles that can do that.

571
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:10,040
 So in this case, this particular ship could, the Oasis of the Seas, but it still wasn't

572
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:11,040
 enough.

573
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:14,560
 So they needed to approach the bridge at 20 knots.

574
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:15,560
 Oh my gosh.

575
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:16,560
 So they did that.

576
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:18,240
 And if you get it wrong, then that's it.

577
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,240
 You're going really fast.

578
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:20,720
 You're going really fast into a bridge.

579
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:21,800
 But it managed to do it.

580
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:24,120
 And it made clearance by a foot.

581
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:28,760
 So they must have, I mean, imagine the maths for that, working out that this is exactly

582
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:29,760
 the right speed.

583
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:30,760
 Yeah.

584
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:31,760
 That's a lot of pressure, isn't it?

585
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:32,760
 Yeah.

586
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:37,320
 So I'm a mathematician just hearing this enormous crunch above deck and looking at your notes

587
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:40,600
 and going, "Oh, I didn't carry the one.

588
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:41,600
 Oh no."

589
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:42,600
 Yeah.

590
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:45,080
 That bridge is called the Great Belt Bridge, right?

591
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:46,080
 In Denmark.

592
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:49,360
 And I checked out whether it has been hit in the past.

593
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:52,040
 It's been hit once since it was opened.

594
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:54,000
 And that was by Karen Danielson.

595
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
 Funny name for a ship.

596
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
 That's the name of the ship.

597
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
 You're joking.

598
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:04,440
 I'm going to be Karen Danielson crashed into it in 2005 and because you couldn't get any

599
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:08,960
 traffic across, this is one of the main bridges from one of the most populous parts of Denmark

600
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:09,960
 to the rest of it.

601
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:14,800
 It basically cut the whole of Denmark into two and no one could get from either side.

602
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:20,480
 Karen Danielson, as far as I can tell, must be named after Karen Danielson, who's a psychoanalyst

603
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:23,160
 because I can't find any other Karen Danielsons.

604
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:25,960
 She might be better known to you as Karen Horney.

605
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:36,160
 No, she's a really, really famous psychoanalyst who is like a feminist Freudian, and Freud

606
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:38,760
 has the theory of penis envy, right?

607
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:42,340
 Women are neurotic because they want to have penises and stuff like that.

608
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:47,160
 She invented something called womb envy in men, and she says that this is just as common

609
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:51,800
 if not more common in men, and men are neurotic because they're envious of women's ability

610
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:57,160
 to bear children, and whereas women fulfill their society simply by being here, men have

611
00:25:57,160 --> 00:26:01,120
 to achieve their manhood by succeeding in life.

612
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:03,560
 So that's Karen Horney.

613
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:06,360
 That's, well, speaking of invention, something I've always wanted to invent the name for,

614
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:08,240
 the opposite of nominative determinism.

615
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:11,160
 She's Horney, and so she's gone in the opposite direction.

616
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:14,640
 She denies all the horny-ness that old Freud put forward.

617
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:18,680
 Yeah, according to Wikipedia, Horney was bewildered by psychiatrists' tendency to

618
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:22,680
 place so much emphasis on the male sexual organ.

619
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:27,240
 What a good reversal would be for nominative determinism, you could call it nominative

620
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:28,240
 deter-minism.

621
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:29,240
 Yes.

622
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:30,760
 So it's putting things off.

623
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:33,160
 I watched that to you a while ago.

624
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:34,160
 Sorry?

625
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:35,160
 I watched that idea to you a while ago.

626
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:36,160
 Yeah, you did.

627
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:42,720
 And as I said it, I thought this bell went ding-a-ling of plagiarism alert, plagiarism alert, but

628
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:49,960
 I thought, ignore the bell, because it was quiet enough that I thought, what are the

629
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:55,100
 odds of plagiarising someone in this room?

630
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:59,080
 I'm really looking forward to your court case, eventually, where when the IQ stands

631
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:04,200
 up and explains what you've done, you just immediately go, "Oh, yeah, no, you're right.

632
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:05,200
 I did.

633
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,200
 Do you mind?"

634
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:07,200
 Yes.

635
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:12,600
 As I was stealing that loaf of bread and the little bell went off, I thought they must

636
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:16,040
 have been a boy wizard called Harry.

637
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:20,880
 Okay, well, can we go back to shipping?

638
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:21,880
 Yeah.

639
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:23,160
 Let's have a ship fact.

640
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:26,320
 Oh, okay, so you want to hear a cool sinking ship fact?

641
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:27,320
 Yes.

642
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:31,640
 This is something I probably said three years ago, but something that someone else said

643
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:33,280
 three years ago.

644
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:39,820
 There are ships called, I'm so paranoid now, semi-submersible ships, they're called heavy

645
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:40,820
 lift ships as well.

646
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:41,820
 Okay.

647
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:42,820
 Is that going off?

648
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:43,820
 No.

649
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:44,820
 Great.

650
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:45,820
 Thank you.

651
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:47,840
 What they do is, they're designed to carry other ships or they're designed to carry

652
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:53,080
 oil rigs or they're designed to carry enormously heavy things, things that weigh tens of thousands

653
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:54,080
 of tonnes.

654
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:59,920
 What they do is, they're these weird, mad, huge platforms with towers at the corners.

655
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:01,080
 They float along.

656
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:05,600
 They then take on huge amounts of water as ballast, millions and millions of litres,

657
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:06,600
 and they sink.

658
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:11,640
 The ship sinks, and then the oil rig or the other ship or whatever floats over the top.

659
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:12,640
 Wow.

660
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:13,640
 So clever.

661
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:16,380
 And then the submersible ship just jettisons all the ballast it took on, and Bob's back

662
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:19,020
 up bringing the thing with it.

663
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:20,020
 Wow.

664
00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:21,020
 Nice.

665
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:22,340
 It's insane.

666
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:24,340
 It's absolutely insane.

667
00:28:24,340 --> 00:28:27,340
 Some of them have feet to clamp onto the key as they're being loaded, so some ships have

668
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:29,060
 legs.

669
00:28:29,060 --> 00:28:30,060
 They're just nuts.

670
00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:33,160
 Did you guys ever read about the Sean O'Casey bridge in Dublin?

671
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:34,160
 Sean O'Casey.

672
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:37,900
 Again, they say Karen Danielson, Sean O'Casey, and we just run out of names.

673
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:40,660
 I actually didn't look up who Sean was, I should have.

674
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:46,840
 There's a bridge that would open in the middle, but not long after they opened it, they lost

675
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:52,240
 the remote control that opened the bridge, and they couldn't find it for four years.

676
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:53,240
 Four years.

677
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:54,240
 It didn't open.

678
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:58,960
 Well, that ship stuck in a traffic jam, the back up getting worse and worse.

679
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:01,200
 Some pilot needed to get in for dinner.

680
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:02,200
 And they found it.

681
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:03,720
 They know they had to just get a new remote.

682
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:05,560
 Why didn't they do that after three years?

683
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:09,520
 It's a slightly confusing story because from what I read, the cost wasn't even that great.

684
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:13,700
 It was only like, compared with the cost of a bridge or the shipping life of a nation.

685
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:14,700
 Exactly.

686
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:15,700
 I sometimes do that.

687
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:18,820
 You know, when you've lost your cheap headphones, you're like, "I will find them.

688
00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:21,340
 I know they're in my room somewhere."

689
00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:25,180
 It's all in one small lounge that they've lost their remote control for the bridge.

690
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:28,900
 They just need to look in the sofa one more time, and it will be there.

691
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:29,900
 Yeah.

692
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:30,900
 My God.

693
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:37,300
 In 2020, there was a Donald Trump boat parade on Lake Travis, which was in the Colorado

694
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:38,300
 River.

695
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:41,720
 There were over a hundred boats, all pro-Trump, they had flags, and they were just having

696
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:45,260
 a great day out doing it like, "Do we support Donald Trump?"

697
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:46,260
 Whatever.

698
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:50,460
 Unfortunately, they generated massive waves, and five of them sank to the bottom of this

699
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:51,460
 lake.

700
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:53,420
 And it was a completely calm day.

701
00:29:53,420 --> 00:29:54,420
 That's the thing.

702
00:29:54,420 --> 00:29:55,420
 Oh, no.

703
00:29:55,420 --> 00:29:56,980
 And it's due to a really bizarre shipping effect.

704
00:29:56,980 --> 00:30:01,420
 So basically, there were boats with planing hulls, which as far as I understand it is,

705
00:30:01,420 --> 00:30:05,620
 above a certain speed, the top rises up a bit, and the boat is effectively riding its

706
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:07,480
 own bow wave.

707
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:13,380
 The problem is that these boats, if they all go at the same speed, they kind of act on

708
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:14,380
 each other.

709
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:15,380
 Oh, yeah.

710
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:18,580
 And the waves that they're generating at 10 miles an hour, which was the speed they had

711
00:30:18,580 --> 00:30:21,820
 all decided to go at, was the worst possible speed to go at.

712
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:22,820
 Nice.

713
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:27,220
 And so they created this enormous set of waves, which they created their own storm, basically.

714
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:28,220
 Oh, my God.

715
00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:29,220
 That's incredible.

716
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:30,220
 I know.

717
00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:31,220
 I know.

718
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:32,220
 If they'd gone at five, it would have been fine.

719
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:33,220
 If they'd gone at 20, it would have been fine.

720
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:34,220
 Or if some had gone at five, and some had gone at 10, and some had gone at 12.

721
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:35,220
 Yeah, exactly.

722
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:36,220
 Yeah, yeah.

723
00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:37,220
 That was terrible.

724
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:38,220
 It's quite impressive.

725
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:41,220
 If it had been intentional, that could be a useful naval military tactic, couldn't it?

726
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:42,220
 Yeah.

727
00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:43,220
 Better than the Old Sedanche.

728
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:44,220
 How are we going to sink our own navy?

729
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:45,220
 Oh, yeah.

730
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:46,220
 What's the tactic?

731
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:47,220
 You need a mole.

732
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:48,220
 You need a mole.

733
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:49,220
 Yeah.

734
00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:52,220
 You need to infiltrate the enemy navy, don't you?

735
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:57,020
 I was actually reading a bit more about the effect that you were talking about at the

736
00:30:57,020 --> 00:30:58,020
 start.

737
00:30:58,020 --> 00:30:59,020
 Yeah.

738
00:30:59,020 --> 00:31:01,260
 And so there are a few effects that ships can pull off.

739
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:02,660
 Another one is the bank effect.

740
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:06,500
 This isn't actually a good thing, but it's very similar mechanism that Dan was talking

741
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:07,500
 about.

742
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:10,260
 So as you said, the ship goes faster and faster, and the water in front of it is displaced,

743
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:11,500
 as we know, so you get that wave.

744
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:17,020
 And that creates a decrease in pressure underneath the ship, and that's called Bernouy's theorem.

745
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:22,060
 But also, it can create a decrease in pressure in the water around a ship's sides.

746
00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:27,580
 So if a ship goes too fast, and then it turns a tiny bit accidentally or something, then

747
00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:32,980
 the pressure will be decreased, and so the ship will move to fill up that space of, you

748
00:31:32,980 --> 00:31:33,980
 know, decreased pressure.

749
00:31:33,980 --> 00:31:34,980
 It'll get sucked in, kind of.

750
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:35,980
 It gets sucked in.

751
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:38,940
 And that means as soon as you turn a corner, you can suddenly get sucked up onto a bank.

752
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:43,060
 And actually, it's posited that, you know, the ever-given that got stranded in the sewers

753
00:31:43,060 --> 00:31:46,260
 canary last year, was it?

754
00:31:46,260 --> 00:31:49,040
 That that may have been what happened there.

755
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:52,860
 Just very quickly, I was reading an article in Hawkeye magazine.

756
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:53,860
 Hawkeye magazine.

757
00:31:53,860 --> 00:31:54,860
 Your favorite mag.

758
00:31:54,860 --> 00:31:55,860
 My favorite mag.

759
00:31:55,860 --> 00:31:56,860
 Yeah.

760
00:31:56,860 --> 00:32:01,380
 It's about ships at sea and all the interesting methods that ships use for various different

761
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:06,180
 safety reasons, and one of which is if you look at a photo of a ship at sea, next time

762
00:32:06,180 --> 00:32:11,800
 you see a photo, have a look out for some people standing on deck, sort of on lookout.

763
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:15,140
 And that's two people, sometimes one, sometimes more.

764
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:18,380
 They're looking out for pirates, because that's a big problem when you're out at sea.

765
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:19,380
 Sure.

766
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:21,220
 But the thing is, is that they're not real people.

767
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:25,660
 These ships have dummies that look like people, who they just place on the side.

768
00:32:25,660 --> 00:32:26,660
 Scarecrows.

769
00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:27,660
 Scarecrows.

770
00:32:27,660 --> 00:32:28,660
 Scarecrows.

771
00:32:28,660 --> 00:32:29,660
 For pirates.

772
00:32:29,660 --> 00:32:30,660
 Yeah.

773
00:32:30,660 --> 00:32:31,660
 Pretty cool.

774
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:35,420
 That was, I think it was in that article as well, that it said about, there was a passing

775
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:39,740
 comment about the metal discs that you see when big ships are moored.

776
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:44,740
 And next time you see a big ship moored, then you'll see that the ropes obviously tied

777
00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:50,620
 around the mooring pole, and then there's often a really big metal disc that looks like

778
00:32:50,620 --> 00:32:52,980
 a giant CD that the ropes woven through.

779
00:32:52,980 --> 00:32:55,980
 In fact, I think that almost always is with big boats.

780
00:32:55,980 --> 00:32:59,380
 And if it's not down by the mooring, it's up against the side of the ship.

781
00:32:59,380 --> 00:33:01,580
 And do you know what that is for?

782
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:02,580
 No.

783
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:03,580
 No.

784
00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:08,820
 So like the big CD that you get in taxis sometimes, is apparently they think that it will stop

785
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:11,940
 speed cameras from being able to catch you.

786
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:14,420
 It's not that, but I did not know that.

787
00:33:14,420 --> 00:33:15,420
 Really?

788
00:33:15,420 --> 00:33:17,980
 I was told that by a taxi driver once, I don't know.

789
00:33:17,980 --> 00:33:18,980
 Right.

790
00:33:18,980 --> 00:33:19,980
 Okay.

791
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:20,980
 Oh, it doesn't work.

792
00:33:20,980 --> 00:33:25,740
 I was a little bit quite anxious in that taxi as he was going at 85 miles an hour and at

793
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:26,740
 20, so I got the CD.

794
00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:29,500
 Calm yourself down, drink some of that young boys' beer and we'll be there in a minute.

795
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:30,500
 Come on.

796
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:31,500
 So it's not that.

797
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:32,500
 It's not that.

798
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:33,500
 It's not that.

799
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:34,500
 It's a safety thing.

800
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:35,500
 It's a rat stopper.

801
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:36,500
 Oh, really?

802
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:37,500
 Oh, really?

803
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:38,500
 A big problem on ships.

804
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:39,500
 Big problem in harbours.

805
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:41,140
 Rat can't run up that rope if you've got a big CD in the way.

806
00:33:41,140 --> 00:33:42,140
 Brilliant.

807
00:33:42,140 --> 00:33:43,140
 It's amazing.

808
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:45,060
 That article just talks about all the things on the side of a ship.

809
00:33:45,060 --> 00:33:48,060
 And I've never stopped to think about what I haven't really looked at the side of ships

810
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:49,180
 too much in my time.

811
00:33:49,180 --> 00:33:53,380
 But it's basically covered in graffiti for the various things that you need to know.

812
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:58,100
 So there'll be signs that will show you how far the ship can dip as a result of the weight

813
00:33:58,100 --> 00:33:59,100
 that it's carrying.

814
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:01,660
 So here are the certain lines that you need to be aware of.

815
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:04,980
 And the lines, there are different lines because if you're going to be in saltwater

816
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:08,460
 versus freshwater versus sort of like tropical water as well.

817
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:09,980
 Is that a flimsole line or something?

818
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:10,980
 Yeah, that's exactly it.

819
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:11,980
 The flimsole.

820
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:12,980
 The flimsole.

821
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:17,380
 And then there's lines to show you that sometimes boats have this little protrusion at the bottom

822
00:34:17,380 --> 00:34:19,900
 of the ship at the front, which you would never see.

823
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:22,820
 So when tugboats are coming out to get it, there's a little symbol.

824
00:34:22,820 --> 00:34:27,020
 It looks like a five that's missing the top that says watch out because you might smack

825
00:34:27,020 --> 00:34:29,020
 into something underwater.

826
00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:33,500
 I think that's to stop the waves from, is it to help it aerodynamically or something?

827
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:34,500
 Yes.

828
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:35,500
 Yeah, yeah.

829
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:36,500
 It's to break the waves somehow.

830
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:39,220
 And it's pretty amazing that these giant ships are basically guided when they come

831
00:34:39,220 --> 00:34:40,220
 into shore.

832
00:34:40,220 --> 00:34:45,380
 If they don't have a pilot doing the various, like very, very careful turning, basically

833
00:34:45,380 --> 00:34:51,240
 tugboats, just tiny little boats because they can't turn it, but those little things are

834
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:53,140
 able to shift an entire ship.

835
00:34:53,140 --> 00:34:56,660
 And a maritime pilot, which I always think is quite cool that you have the pilots who

836
00:34:56,660 --> 00:35:00,580
 wait in the harbors or at difficult channels like the Suez.

837
00:35:00,580 --> 00:35:04,740
 And these are the real pros who just know that very specific area of water and they

838
00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:07,300
 leap on the boat and tell you how to do it.

839
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:09,900
 I saw that in action in Sydney at the Sydney Harbour.

840
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:13,740
 So I was having a drink outside the Opera House and there was a cruise ship that was

841
00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:14,740
 going out.

842
00:35:14,740 --> 00:35:17,940
 And it's a very hard turn that it needs to make by the bridge.

843
00:35:17,940 --> 00:35:23,100
 So they just have a pilot come on, get it out, and then he gets in a dinghy or a helicopter

844
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:24,620
 and just gets off the boat again.

845
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:25,620
 That's it.

846
00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:26,620
 It's amazing.

847
00:35:26,620 --> 00:35:27,620
 Yeah.

848
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:28,620
 Not dissimilar to airline pilots, right?

849
00:35:28,620 --> 00:35:29,620
 They take off and land, but then when they're cruising...

850
00:35:29,620 --> 00:35:32,620
 And then they jump off in the middle of the boat.

851
00:35:32,620 --> 00:35:35,100
 They get a helicopter off the plane at night.

852
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:39,940
 One more thing about boats and bridges from me, and that is about the Kinsey Street Bridge

853
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:42,300
 in Chicago.

854
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:46,820
 This is a bridge going over a river and the bridge is kind of...

855
00:35:46,820 --> 00:35:49,220
 It's mesh on the bottom, right?

856
00:35:49,220 --> 00:35:51,380
 So it's to kind of make it easier to clean.

857
00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:54,220
 If anything falls onto the road, it's just going to go straight down.

858
00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:55,220
 Do you know what I mean?

859
00:35:55,220 --> 00:35:56,220
 It's like a mesh.

860
00:35:56,220 --> 00:35:57,220
 Sort of.

861
00:35:57,220 --> 00:35:58,780
 Because when he said mesh, I was thinking of a sieve and they're the hardest things

862
00:35:58,780 --> 00:35:59,780
 to clean.

863
00:35:59,780 --> 00:36:00,780
 Absolutely right.

864
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:01,780
 But absolutely right.

865
00:36:01,780 --> 00:36:02,780
 In this instance.

866
00:36:02,780 --> 00:36:03,780
 Yeah.

867
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:05,740
 The holes are big enough that things can pass through like a sieve.

868
00:36:05,740 --> 00:36:08,780
 You're not going to get little bits of rice stuck in the culver.

869
00:36:08,780 --> 00:36:12,500
 The main traffic on the road is just loose rice.

870
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:15,540
 Anyway, so there's a band called the Dave Matthews Band.

871
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:16,540
 Yeah.

872
00:36:16,540 --> 00:36:17,540
 Yeah, you know, right?

873
00:36:17,540 --> 00:36:22,060
 And they were gigging and the guy who was driving their bus decided that he was going

874
00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:27,620
 to dump all of their human waste as he drove over the Kinsey Street Bridge because he felt

875
00:36:27,620 --> 00:36:28,620
 well, it's a mesh.

876
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:29,620
 It just passed straight through.

877
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:30,620
 Right?

878
00:36:30,620 --> 00:36:31,620
 So he did that.

879
00:36:31,620 --> 00:36:32,620
 This is in 2004.

880
00:36:32,620 --> 00:36:37,940
 Unfortunately, at the same time as he did this, a tourist boat was going underneath

881
00:36:37,940 --> 00:36:38,940
 the bridge.

882
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:39,940
 Open top?

883
00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:40,940
 Open top.

884
00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:41,940
 Oh my God.

885
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:49,980
 And that incident led to more than three hundred thousand dollars in settlements, donations

886
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:50,980
 and fines.

887
00:36:50,980 --> 00:36:51,980
 Wow.

888
00:36:51,980 --> 00:36:52,980
 Really?

889
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:53,980
 Yeah.

890
00:36:53,980 --> 00:36:54,980
 Oh my God.

891
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:58,460
 And the Dave Matthews Band always now has agreed to keep a log of whenever it empties

892
00:36:58,460 --> 00:36:59,460
 its septic tanks.

893
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:00,460
 Keep a log, eh?

894
00:37:00,460 --> 00:37:10,300
 Logs feel like they were the problem in the first place.

895
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:11,460
 That's amazing.

896
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:15,180
 OK, it is time for our final fact of the show, and that is Andy.

897
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:20,700
 My fact is that the art of wooden lacrosse stick making is extinct in the UK.

898
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:21,700
 Oh no.

899
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:23,180
 Is that global warming?

900
00:37:23,180 --> 00:37:29,720
 I said it in a cheery way, but it's actually a very sad fact, obviously, because you can't

901
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:31,220
 go to wooden lacrosse stick in the UK anymore.

902
00:37:31,220 --> 00:37:32,580
 Well, you can import one.

903
00:37:32,580 --> 00:37:34,180
 Well, you can import one.

904
00:37:34,180 --> 00:37:35,180
 You can buy an old one.

905
00:37:35,180 --> 00:37:38,260
 We've just done a whole section on massive ships, you know what they use massive ships

906
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:39,260
 for?

907
00:37:39,260 --> 00:37:40,260
 It is importing.

908
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:41,260
 Lacrosse stick.

909
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:45,460
 This is a fact about, basically, I was on the website of the Heritage Crafts Organization,

910
00:37:45,460 --> 00:37:49,140
 which they're the advocates for traditional crafts, and they keep this amazing watch list

911
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:54,660
 of traditional crafts, which are either fine, you know, sustainable, or slightly endangered,

912
00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:59,720
 or critically endangered, or extinct, and lacrosse stick making went extinct.

913
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:05,640
 In 2014, there's a phone called Hatter's Lease, which is the UK's main lacrosse stick manufacturer.

914
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:09,080
 But their last wooden stick maker retired in 2014.

915
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:10,520
 He was called Tom Beckett.

916
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:12,320
 Oh, Thomas Beckett.

917
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:13,320
 Probably not.

918
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:16,080
 Well, no one rid me of this troublesome lacrosse stick maker.

919
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:20,960
 Yes, how did his life end, actually?

920
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:23,240
 He wasn't murdered on the steps of a...

921
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:24,240
 He's still alive.

922
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:25,240
 Tom Beckett.

923
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:26,240
 There we go.

924
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:27,240
 Well, thank God.

925
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:29,240
 Still goes for a curry every year with the rest of the people at Hatter's Lease.

926
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:30,240
 Does he?

927
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:31,240
 Yeah.

928
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:32,240
 James, you've been in touch with them.

929
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:33,240
 I have.

930
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:36,220
 What a blindingly good guess.

931
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:37,220
 I have.

932
00:38:37,220 --> 00:38:42,500
 I was asking them why they have a stick called the Victoria Cross, but Victoria was with

933
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:47,100
 a K, and it's the best stick that they ever made, and I asked them why they called it the

934
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:52,620
 Victoria Cross, and why it has a K, and neither Tom nor David Hay, who's the head of sales

935
00:38:52,620 --> 00:38:53,620
 knew.

936
00:38:53,620 --> 00:38:55,240
 Because it's all plastic these days.

937
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:56,240
 That's the sad thing.

938
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:57,240
 Is it?

939
00:38:57,240 --> 00:38:58,240
 The lacrosse sticks.

940
00:38:58,240 --> 00:38:59,240
 Yeah.

941
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:00,240
 Yeah.

942
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:01,740
 Because they're lighter and they're more efficient.

943
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:07,320
 One reason is because they yield on impact, because it's quite a violent spot lacrosse,

944
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:11,000
 and so if you hit someone across the head with a lacrosse stick, which is wooden, they're

945
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:14,760
 going to do a lot of damage, but the carbon fiber ones bounce right off.

946
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:15,760
 Yeah.

947
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:16,760
 It's all gone soft these days, hasn't it?

948
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:19,280
 You can't even beat people over the head with a stick anymore.

949
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:20,280
 Well, did you hear?

950
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:21,280
 Did you hear?

951
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:22,280
 I mean, that is an important thing.

952
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:23,280
 It's a record.

953
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:24,280
 Wheaton College.

954
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:25,280
 Sorry.

955
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:26,280
 Wheaton College.

956
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:27,280
 Where were you educated?

957
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:28,280
 Wheaton...

958
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:29,280
 Eaton College.

959
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,280
 Eaton College.

960
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:31,280
 Really?

961
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:32,280
 Yeah.

962
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:33,280
 Wheaton College is the equivalent.

963
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:34,280
 It's twinned.

964
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:35,280
 It's twinned with Eaton.

965
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:38,380
 He was 19 at the time, called Alex Chew.

966
00:39:38,380 --> 00:39:41,700
 It's the French Eaton, isn't it?

967
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:44,420
 Meh, Wheaton.

968
00:39:44,420 --> 00:39:48,900
 He was up until this point playing lacrosse his entire school life for the school teams,

969
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:53,760
 and then he became a freshman at Wheaton College, and was told he couldn't play anymore because

970
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:57,240
 his head was too big for any of the helmets.

971
00:39:57,240 --> 00:40:01,000
 They just didn't make helmets big enough for this guy's head.

972
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:04,040
 I think what he used to do was, the reason he was allowed to play before was that he

973
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:06,300
 pieced together parts of two different helmets.

974
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:09,180
 He created a bigger helmet for his massive head.

975
00:40:09,180 --> 00:40:10,180
 Does it sound very safe?

976
00:40:10,180 --> 00:40:14,840
 You know, if you get two cars and weld them together, that's really unsafe, isn't it?

977
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:15,840
 Yeah, exactly.

978
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:16,840
 So he didn't get to play.

979
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:17,840
 Wait, sorry.

980
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:18,840
 You need to sit on the sides.

981
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:21,940
 Are the helmet makers of Massachusetts also extinct?

982
00:40:21,940 --> 00:40:24,840
 Is there no one available to make him?

983
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:26,380
 No one built him a bigger helmet.

984
00:40:26,380 --> 00:40:27,380
 He couldn't play.

985
00:40:27,380 --> 00:40:30,380
 He played, I think, one game that season, and I think that might have been a mistake.

986
00:40:30,380 --> 00:40:31,380
 You know what?

987
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:34,560
 He could have played women's lacrosse because they don't wear helmets in women's lacrosse.

988
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:37,900
 No, not because it's almost a completely different game.

989
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:38,900
 It's so weird.

990
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:39,900
 Yeah, it's so weird.

991
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:40,900
 They're different sports.

992
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:44,860
 Well, so they say, I actually think they're really similar, but if you ask people who

993
00:40:44,860 --> 00:40:47,560
 play lacrosse of either type, they say they're really different sports, don't they?

994
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:48,560
 Yeah.

995
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:51,480
 And they don't really do the body contact so much in women's sports.

996
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:53,960
 So the men's lacrosse is incredibly violent.

997
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:59,360
 Basically, you can essentially just attack someone with a large stick, as long as it's

998
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:04,800
 not deemed to be sort of like unduly really intentionally aggressive, I think.

999
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:06,680
 Whereas in women's, you can stick people.

1000
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:07,680
 You can stick people.

1001
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:08,680
 What do they call it?

1002
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:09,680
 Stick people?

1003
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:10,680
 Slashing and cocky?

1004
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:14,540
 Stick check. In women's, you can stick check so you can hit their stick with your stick.

1005
00:41:14,540 --> 00:41:15,540
 Oh, okay.

1006
00:41:15,540 --> 00:41:16,980
 You can't really bash them around the face.

1007
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:19,040
 Could you hit their fingers holding the stick with your stick?

1008
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:20,040
 I think you can do that.

1009
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:21,040
 Oh, yeah.

1010
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:23,620
 And I should say in men's, actually, you can't bash them around the face, but the torso,

1011
00:41:23,620 --> 00:41:24,620
 free for all.

1012
00:41:24,620 --> 00:41:25,620
 Golly.

1013
00:41:25,620 --> 00:41:26,620
 Really interesting.

1014
00:41:26,620 --> 00:41:28,120
 And it's all down to a woman called Rosabelle Sinclair.

1015
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:32,700
 And what happened was, so lacrosse is an old Native American sport.

1016
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:36,060
 They played it in America, but it was in the early 20th century.

1017
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:41,080
 Girls weren't really allowed to play lacrosse, and so it was an all-boy sport pretty much.

1018
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:47,120
 They came over to the UK and had an exhibition in front of Queen Victoria.

1019
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:48,280
 So this is a bit earlier.

1020
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:53,200
 And Queen Victoria said it would be a great game for girls to play in public schools.

1021
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:55,640
 And so they started playing it in public schools.

1022
00:41:55,640 --> 00:42:00,120
 And so you had this one spot in the UK, which was all girls playing in school.

1023
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:03,300
 And you have this one spot in America, which was all boys playing, and they've kind of

1024
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:05,440
 evolved quite differently.

1025
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:11,200
 And then Rosabelle Sinclair took the girls' game over to America, but she decided she

1026
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:14,360
 was going to stick to the girls' rules that they had in the UK.

1027
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:18,640
 And so that's why now in America, it's almost like netball and basketball.

1028
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:21,000
 Not quite, but they're quite different sports.

1029
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,200
 That makes sense.

1030
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:26,760
 And I'd love to see a team of traditional women's lacrosse players play the men's,

1031
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:32,240
 because just FYI, if you're an American listener, lacrosse in the UK is pretty much, I think,

1032
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:36,340
 reserved for, well, this is an anecdote, this is just based on my own life experience.

1033
00:42:36,340 --> 00:42:41,140
 But in my own life experience, lacrosse is basically reserved for very posh school girls.

1034
00:42:41,140 --> 00:42:45,020
 And in America, it seems to be reserved for extremely hardcore, large men.

1035
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:49,420
 So I was talking to someone the other day, a friend of mine who played a little bit of

1036
00:42:49,420 --> 00:42:52,140
 lacrosse, and she said it is quite violent still.

1037
00:42:52,140 --> 00:42:56,180
 Yeah, it's pretty primal.

1038
00:42:56,180 --> 00:43:00,020
 So the kind of aggression of it, I think kind of makes sense for the origins of it.

1039
00:43:00,020 --> 00:43:02,040
 So it was played in the 1500s.

1040
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:08,360
 Native Americans did it as a way of kind of battling between local tribes, didn't they?

1041
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:12,560
 They sort of, they would have games that would last for days, and the teams could be anything

1042
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:15,880
 from five players to over 100 players.

1043
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:16,880
 And it was...

1044
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:19,000
 You set up with your four mates.

1045
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:24,880
 Oh, no, they've gone for the opposite, actually, in many ways.

1046
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:29,000
 But yeah, that's kind of the origins of it, isn't it?

1047
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:34,760
 Yeah, there's one claim on the World Lacrosse Federation website, which says that sometimes

1048
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:37,860
 games can involve up to 100,000 players.

1049
00:43:37,860 --> 00:43:38,860
 What?

1050
00:43:38,860 --> 00:43:44,900
 It's so clearly balanced, isn't it?

1051
00:43:44,900 --> 00:43:46,860
 But that's what it claims in there, the authority.

1052
00:43:46,860 --> 00:43:47,860
 That is amazing.

1053
00:43:47,860 --> 00:43:52,180
 It would certainly come and have over 1,000 people, and I thought it was true.

1054
00:43:52,180 --> 00:43:53,180
 100,000?

1055
00:43:53,180 --> 00:43:54,180
 Was it war?

1056
00:43:54,180 --> 00:43:56,180
 Or was it, were they fighting?

1057
00:43:56,180 --> 00:43:57,180
 Well, we don't...

1058
00:43:57,180 --> 00:43:58,180
 That's still a big war.

1059
00:43:58,180 --> 00:43:59,180
 It is.

1060
00:43:59,180 --> 00:44:00,180
 Yeah.

1061
00:44:00,180 --> 00:44:03,060
 On one side, you've got lacrosse players coming, Sedan chers, or the other.

1062
00:44:03,060 --> 00:44:04,060
 That's the type trouble.

1063
00:44:04,060 --> 00:44:09,060
 It was actually one team of five, and then another team of 99,995, and it was a draw.

1064
00:44:09,060 --> 00:44:11,420
 It was a draw in the end.

1065
00:44:11,420 --> 00:44:12,420
 Amazing.

1066
00:44:12,420 --> 00:44:13,420
 That's mental.

1067
00:44:13,420 --> 00:44:14,420
 Wow.

1068
00:44:14,420 --> 00:44:18,380
 But it was like it would be over vast distances, so Native Americans would be, you know, running

1069
00:44:18,380 --> 00:44:23,060
 between states practically, and people subbing in and out quite a lot, I think, over many

1070
00:44:23,060 --> 00:44:24,060
 days.

1071
00:44:24,060 --> 00:44:27,900
 It is the only sport that recognises Native Americans and First Nations people as their

1072
00:44:27,900 --> 00:44:33,180
 own individual nations, so they will, you know, in international games, you would enter as

1073
00:44:33,180 --> 00:44:37,380
 an individual nation, like the Mohawk nation, and in fact, that caused a real problem.

1074
00:44:37,380 --> 00:44:43,100
 They travel on their own passports, so I think the Iroquois lacrosse team travels on Iroquois

1075
00:44:43,100 --> 00:44:44,100
 passports.

1076
00:44:44,100 --> 00:44:48,380
 Iroquois and Haudenosaunee, by the way, are sort of synonymous, except they call themselves

1077
00:44:48,380 --> 00:44:49,380
 Haudenosaunee.

1078
00:44:49,380 --> 00:44:51,940
 But, yeah, the passports tend to be recognised.

1079
00:44:51,940 --> 00:44:56,140
 There was a bit of an issue in 2010 when Britain denied entry to the Iroquois team because

1080
00:44:56,140 --> 00:44:57,860
 they didn't accept their passports.

1081
00:44:57,860 --> 00:45:01,360
 They wanted them to have US passports, and they said, "Well, we don't consider ourselves

1082
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:02,360
 American."

1083
00:45:02,360 --> 00:45:03,360
 Right.

1084
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:04,360
 They didn't play.

1085
00:45:04,360 --> 00:45:05,360
 Lacrosse might come back, by the way, to the Olympics.

1086
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:06,360
 It is coming back.

1087
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:07,360
 Yeah, because it's such a growing sport, isn't it?

1088
00:45:07,360 --> 00:45:11,940
 So, 2018, they were given the status of receiving funds, which meant that they could sort of,

1089
00:45:11,940 --> 00:45:13,660
 like, start showing that it was possible.

1090
00:45:13,660 --> 00:45:19,180
 And now an official, whatever the official sport that you need to be in order to get to

1091
00:45:19,180 --> 00:45:20,820
 the Olympics, they are now that.

1092
00:45:20,820 --> 00:45:21,820
 Yeah.

1093
00:45:21,820 --> 00:45:22,820
 So, they'll be there for the 2028.

1094
00:45:22,820 --> 00:45:23,820
 Yeah, hopefully.

1095
00:45:23,820 --> 00:45:24,820
 Really?

1096
00:45:24,820 --> 00:45:25,820
 Yeah.

1097
00:45:25,820 --> 00:45:29,740
 So, speaking of, this is just something I read today about hockey, so it must be the

1098
00:45:29,740 --> 00:45:31,240
 same with Lacrosse.

1099
00:45:31,240 --> 00:45:36,020
 And that is that if you're a sports person in Canada, you're doing your sport, you're

1100
00:45:36,020 --> 00:45:40,980
 getting really sweaty, all your gear, your mitts, and your shirt and everything, your

1101
00:45:40,980 --> 00:45:45,740
 underwear gets really, really smelly, but you can't put it outside to air, right, because

1102
00:45:45,740 --> 00:45:46,740
 it's so cold.

1103
00:45:46,740 --> 00:45:47,740
 Okay.

1104
00:45:47,740 --> 00:45:52,160
 And so, traditionally, you find that these people have really, really smelly clothes and

1105
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:53,800
 a kit and stuff like that.

1106
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:57,180
 And so, they invented this thing, I can't remember what it's called, but it's like a

1107
00:45:57,180 --> 00:46:03,660
 big sort of trunk, and you put your kit in, and it fires UV light into the trunk.

1108
00:46:03,660 --> 00:46:07,140
 And then that makes ozone, and the ozone kills all of the bacteria.

1109
00:46:07,140 --> 00:46:08,140
 Wow.

1110
00:46:08,140 --> 00:46:11,740
 And when the bacteria is dyed, it means it can't make all the smells, and so, it kind

1111
00:46:11,740 --> 00:46:13,940
 of gets rid of all the smell of your kit.

1112
00:46:13,940 --> 00:46:15,540
 And this is the amazing thing.

1113
00:46:15,540 --> 00:46:19,620
 What they hope in the future is, they might be able to scale this up to the size of a

1114
00:46:19,620 --> 00:46:20,620
 room.

1115
00:46:20,620 --> 00:46:23,920
 So, you would come in after your game of hockey or lacrosse or whatever, you'd hang

1116
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:27,880
 up your stuff, you'd go out of the room, close the door, and when the last person closed

1117
00:46:27,880 --> 00:46:32,240
 the door, the whole place gets filled with UV light and ozone, and then when you come

1118
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:35,800
 back in, it's all clean and not salient, isn't that amazing?

1119
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:39,560
 So, might we have these instead of bathrooms in the future, instead of a shower?

1120
00:46:39,560 --> 00:46:43,520
 Oh my, you know what I thought, because I read this article, and what I thought is,

1121
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:47,680
 it could be useful for putting your underwear in, right, you know, like if you have a linen

1122
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:51,780
 basket or something, get changed at night, take your underwear off, put it in the basket,

1123
00:46:51,780 --> 00:46:54,380
 next morning, take it out again, it's fine.

1124
00:46:54,380 --> 00:46:55,380
 Brilliant.

1125
00:46:55,380 --> 00:46:57,040
 You don't need clothes anymore, basically.

1126
00:46:57,040 --> 00:46:58,180
 You don't need more than one of everything.

1127
00:46:58,180 --> 00:47:01,900
 Just one set of clothes for the rest of your life, and one set of night clothes if you

1128
00:47:01,900 --> 00:47:02,900
 wear them.

1129
00:47:02,900 --> 00:47:03,900
 Yeah, exactly.

1130
00:47:03,900 --> 00:47:06,300
 I mean, you can also put your clothes on a washing machine and a dryer.

1131
00:47:06,300 --> 00:47:07,300
 Yeah, but that's two things.

1132
00:47:07,300 --> 00:47:08,300
 It's a combined system.

1133
00:47:08,300 --> 00:47:10,300
 You can use loads of water.

1134
00:47:10,300 --> 00:47:13,380
 Can't do it at night, because it upsets your neighbors.

1135
00:47:13,380 --> 00:47:15,140
 I do it literally every night, oh my god.

1136
00:47:15,140 --> 00:47:16,140
 What?

1137
00:47:16,140 --> 00:47:17,140
 Put your washing machine on?

1138
00:47:17,140 --> 00:47:18,140
 Oh my god.

1139
00:47:18,140 --> 00:47:19,140
 Your psycho.

1140
00:47:19,140 --> 00:47:20,140
 It's all right.

1141
00:47:20,140 --> 00:47:21,140
 He lives in a cottage on the top of the mountain.

1142
00:47:21,140 --> 00:47:22,140
 In the moors, yeah.

1143
00:47:22,140 --> 00:47:28,140
 What you can also do is take your clothes to a tanning salon, presumably, and drop them

1144
00:47:28,140 --> 00:47:30,660
 off, and ask them to book in a session.

1145
00:47:30,660 --> 00:47:31,660
 Book a bed.

1146
00:47:31,660 --> 00:47:35,020
 Book a bed, and you come and you take all your clothes off, and they go, well, if you'd

1147
00:47:35,020 --> 00:47:37,020
 like to get in, you say, no, no, here you go.

1148
00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:40,000
 You've got to make sat in a chair naked next to it.

1149
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
 I'm going to climb into a washing machine now.

1150
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:45,600
 You've got to make sure all of the employees know that that's happening, because they don't

1151
00:47:45,600 --> 00:47:46,600
 want to open a sunbed.

1152
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:47,600
 Just see the missing body.

1153
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:48,600
 Oh my god.

1154
00:47:48,600 --> 00:47:49,600
 It happened again.

1155
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:50,600
 She's melted.

1156
00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:56,260
 Can we talk about some extinct crafts?

1157
00:47:56,260 --> 00:47:57,260
 Sure.

1158
00:47:57,260 --> 00:48:04,660
 So I spent quite a while on the Heritage Crafts website, Patron, Prince Charles, obviously.

1159
00:48:04,660 --> 00:48:06,180
 So I thought I'd do a little quiz for you.

1160
00:48:06,180 --> 00:48:07,180
 Okay.

1161
00:48:07,180 --> 00:48:08,180
 Right.

1162
00:48:08,180 --> 00:48:12,980
 Is this craft endangered, critically endangered, currently viable, or extinct?

1163
00:48:12,980 --> 00:48:13,980
 Okay.

1164
00:48:13,980 --> 00:48:19,000
 But you sent us the link of this list, so we all have a bit of an advantage.

1165
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,500
 We might still do badly, but- Absolutely.

1166
00:48:20,500 --> 00:48:21,500
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1167
00:48:21,500 --> 00:48:23,500
 I've got it literally open in front of you right now.

1168
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:24,500
 Shit.

1169
00:48:24,500 --> 00:48:25,500
 Okay.

1170
00:48:25,500 --> 00:48:26,500
 I'll close it.

1171
00:48:26,500 --> 00:48:27,500
 I'll close it.

1172
00:48:27,500 --> 00:48:29,000
 I never bothered to read the sources you sent around, so I'm coming to this knife.

1173
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:30,000
 All right.

1174
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,000
 Orary making.

1175
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:32,000
 Orary.

1176
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:33,000
 Orary.

1177
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,680
 So an orary is like the solar system, right?

1178
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:36,680
 Exactly.

1179
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:37,680
 It's a model of the solar system.

1180
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:38,680
 Oh, that's fine.

1181
00:48:38,680 --> 00:48:39,680
 That's fine.

1182
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:42,840
 Because, oh yeah, it's in every kid's toy shop, you've got to make them for kids.

1183
00:48:42,840 --> 00:48:44,020
 I'm with Dan, then.

1184
00:48:44,020 --> 00:48:45,360
 He has inside a knowledge here.

1185
00:48:45,360 --> 00:48:46,360
 Okay.

1186
00:48:46,360 --> 00:48:47,360
 You're so viable.

1187
00:48:47,360 --> 00:48:48,360
 I'm saying, yeah.

1188
00:48:48,360 --> 00:48:49,360
 Okay.

1189
00:48:49,360 --> 00:48:50,360
 No probes.

1190
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:51,360
 Probably 200 of them.

1191
00:48:51,360 --> 00:48:52,360
 Two in North London alone.

1192
00:48:52,360 --> 00:48:53,360
 There are 100,000 actually.

1193
00:48:53,360 --> 00:48:54,860
 They all pale across.

1194
00:48:54,860 --> 00:48:59,300
 No, it's critically endangered as one full-time professional orary maker in the UK.

1195
00:48:59,300 --> 00:49:00,300
 Really?

1196
00:49:00,300 --> 00:49:01,300
 Well, he's doing a damn good job.

1197
00:49:01,300 --> 00:49:02,500
 I won't just sing in toy shops, Dan.

1198
00:49:02,500 --> 00:49:05,940
 I'm not sure I'm made by the real hand-made heritage.

1199
00:49:05,940 --> 00:49:06,940
 Mechanical, mechanical.

1200
00:49:06,940 --> 00:49:07,940
 The craft.

1201
00:49:07,940 --> 00:49:08,940
 Dice plastic ones.

1202
00:49:08,940 --> 00:49:12,420
 Mr. Fisher, he's the last one.

1203
00:49:12,420 --> 00:49:16,080
 Timothy Staines and his father, Derek, who was the previous full-timer, they make six

1204
00:49:16,080 --> 00:49:17,080
 to ten of these per year.

1205
00:49:17,080 --> 00:49:19,360
 Timothy Staines, by the way, is a sentence name.

1206
00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:22,240
 Oh, so it is.

1207
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:24,840
 Welcome to the club, Timothy.

1208
00:49:24,840 --> 00:49:27,200
 Rake making.

1209
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:28,600
 Is Oral Babes a sentence?

1210
00:49:28,600 --> 00:49:29,600
 No, it isn't.

1211
00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:30,600
 Sorry.

1212
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:31,600
 No.

1213
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:32,600
 What were you saying?

1214
00:49:32,600 --> 00:49:33,600
 Rake making.

1215
00:49:33,600 --> 00:49:34,600
 Rake making.

1216
00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:35,600
 I think, yeah, everyone needs a rake, don't they, if you have a garden?

1217
00:49:35,600 --> 00:49:39,240
 A garden implement, not a bit of a slimy, sleazy, loud-about clown.

1218
00:49:39,240 --> 00:49:40,240
 No, no.

1219
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:41,240
 Okay.

1220
00:49:41,240 --> 00:49:42,240
 Then there's loads of them.

1221
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:43,240
 The least five.

1222
00:49:43,240 --> 00:49:44,240
 It's endangered.

1223
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:46,680
 Yeah, there are only about 5,000 made per year.

1224
00:49:46,680 --> 00:49:49,120
 There's specific kinds of rake, not just in all galleries.

1225
00:49:49,120 --> 00:49:50,120
 One more.

1226
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:51,280
 Rocking horse manufacturer.

1227
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:52,280
 Viable.

1228
00:49:52,280 --> 00:49:53,280
 Extinct.

1229
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:54,280
 Yeah.

1230
00:49:54,280 --> 00:49:55,280
 Viable.

1231
00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:56,280
 It's viable.

1232
00:49:56,280 --> 00:49:57,280
 Okay.

1233
00:49:57,280 --> 00:50:00,420
 There is a guild of rocking horse makers, which has 2,000 members.

1234
00:50:00,420 --> 00:50:03,860
 The only qualification is you have to have made a rocking horse, which is fair enough,

1235
00:50:03,860 --> 00:50:04,860
 to be a member of the guild.

1236
00:50:04,860 --> 00:50:05,860
 Yeah.

1237
00:50:05,860 --> 00:50:09,220
 You don't have to have made it in the traditional age or sculpting.

1238
00:50:09,220 --> 00:50:12,220
 I imagine there are some barriers to entry about what qualifies as a rocking horse.

1239
00:50:12,220 --> 00:50:15,880
 Of course, you can't just make any old shit and save some rocking horse and then claim

1240
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:16,880
 your guild's membership.

1241
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:17,880
 No, you have to.

1242
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:18,880
 Okay.

1243
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:19,880
 Yeah, but I don't know exactly what the criteria are.

1244
00:50:19,880 --> 00:50:20,880
 I'm going to test this.

1245
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:21,880
 Level of rock or whatever.

1246
00:50:21,880 --> 00:50:23,360
 I read this incredible article.

1247
00:50:23,360 --> 00:50:24,360
 Did any of you read it?

1248
00:50:24,360 --> 00:50:25,600
 It's called Raiders of the Lost Crafts.

1249
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:27,100
 It was in The Independent in 2016.

1250
00:50:27,100 --> 00:50:28,100
 No.

1251
00:50:28,100 --> 00:50:29,100
 Raiders of the Lost Crafts.

1252
00:50:29,100 --> 00:50:31,440
 It was written by a woman called Amalia Ildner.

1253
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:36,880
 She talked about, so, pole leaf woodturning, which is when a crockery used to be wooden.

1254
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:39,440
 I didn't know you had wooden crockery.

1255
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:43,180
 Most people would because it was just the most available substance, so back in Tudor

1256
00:50:43,180 --> 00:50:44,180
 Times, for instance.

1257
00:50:44,180 --> 00:50:45,180
 It's probably not...

1258
00:50:45,180 --> 00:50:46,740
 I thought crockery was like the noise it made, got that.

1259
00:50:46,740 --> 00:50:48,660
 It's probably like blockery or something.

1260
00:50:48,660 --> 00:50:49,660
 Blockery.

1261
00:50:49,660 --> 00:50:50,660
 Yeah.

1262
00:50:50,660 --> 00:50:51,660
 Yeah.

1263
00:50:51,660 --> 00:50:52,660
 Woodery.

1264
00:50:52,660 --> 00:50:53,660
 I mean, blockery is a joke.

1265
00:50:53,660 --> 00:50:54,660
 Woodery is just...

1266
00:50:54,660 --> 00:50:55,660
 It's not...

1267
00:50:55,660 --> 00:51:01,740
 I can't wait to hear Andy make that joke again in three weeks time.

1268
00:51:01,740 --> 00:51:02,740
 I tell you what.

1269
00:51:02,740 --> 00:51:07,740
 When I tell it, you'll laugh.

1270
00:51:07,740 --> 00:51:10,520
 Okay, that's it.

1271
00:51:10,520 --> 00:51:11,520
 That is all of our facts.

1272
00:51:11,520 --> 00:51:13,080
 Thank you so much for listening.

1273
00:51:13,080 --> 00:51:16,040
 If you'd like to get in contact with any of us about the things that we've said over

1274
00:51:16,040 --> 00:51:19,860
 the course of this podcast, we can all be found on our Twitter accounts.

1275
00:51:19,860 --> 00:51:21,360
 I'm on @Sriberland.

1276
00:51:21,360 --> 00:51:22,360
 Andy.

1277
00:51:22,360 --> 00:51:23,360
 @Sriberland.

1278
00:51:23,360 --> 00:51:24,360
 James.

1279
00:51:24,360 --> 00:51:25,360
 Bit weird, but James.

1280
00:51:25,360 --> 00:51:27,360
 @JamesHarkin.

1281
00:51:27,360 --> 00:51:28,360
 And Anna.

1282
00:51:28,360 --> 00:51:29,360
 You can email podcast@qi.com.

1283
00:51:29,360 --> 00:51:30,360
 Yep.

1284
00:51:30,360 --> 00:51:34,880
 Well, you can go to our group account, which is @andrewhunterm, or you can go to our website.

1285
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:36,560
 No such thing as a fish.com.

1286
00:51:36,560 --> 00:51:38,260
 All of our previous episodes are up there.

1287
00:51:38,260 --> 00:51:41,340
 There's also a link to the upcoming tour dates that we're doing later this year.

1288
00:51:41,340 --> 00:51:43,700
 Do check them out and see if we're coming to a place near you.

1289
00:51:43,700 --> 00:51:48,140
 Otherwise, you can listen to us again next week on this channel, on this podcast.

1290
00:51:48,140 --> 00:51:49,140
 We'll see you then.

1291
00:51:49,140 --> 00:51:49,640
 Goodbye.

1292
00:51:49,640 --> 00:51:50,640
 Bye.

1293
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:51,640
 Bye.

1294
00:51:51,640 --> 00:51:52,640
 Bye.

1295
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:52,640
 Bye.

1296
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:53,640
 Bye.

1297
00:51:53,640 --> 00:51:54,640
 Bye.

1298
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:54,640
 Bye.

1299
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:55,640
 Bye.

1300
00:51:55,640 --> 00:51:56,640
 Bye.

1301
00:51:56,640 --> 00:51:56,640
 Bye.

1302
00:51:56,640 --> 00:51:59,220
 (upbeat music)

1303
00:51:59,220 --> 00:52:01,800
 (upbeat music)
