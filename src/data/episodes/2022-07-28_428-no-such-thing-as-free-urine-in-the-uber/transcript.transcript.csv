00:00:13,00:00:19,"Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming"
00:00:19,00:00:22,to you from the QI offices in Covent Garden.
00:00:22,00:00:26,"My name is Dan Schreiber, I'm sitting here with Andrew Hunter Murray, James Harkin and"
00:00:26,00:00:30,"Anna Tyshinski and once again, we have gathered round the microphones with our four favorite"
00:00:30,00:00:35,"facts from the last seven days and in no particular order, here we go."
00:00:35,00:00:39,Starting with fact number one and that is Anna.
00:00:39,00:00:44,My fact this week is that pedestrians used to be expected to give way to sedan chairs.
00:00:44,00:00:45,Oh wow.
00:00:45,00:00:48,So they're the e-scooters of their day.
00:00:48,00:00:51,They couldn't have been more so from everything I've read about them.
00:00:51,00:00:54,A pedestrian is still expected to give way to sedan chairs but there aren't any sedan
00:00:54,00:00:55,chairs so it doesn't matter.
00:00:55,00:00:56,Oh like legally.
00:00:56,00:00:57,It's a really good question.
00:00:57,00:01:01,"We'll have to, I guess we have to set it up with one of us, well it would require three"
00:01:01,00:01:04,of us to have a sedan chair and then one of us to find a policeman to arrest him.
00:01:04,00:01:08,"Well no, no, we only need one sedan chair and two people to lift it."
00:01:08,00:01:09,We need three people.
00:01:09,00:01:10,"Yeah, that's what I mean."
00:01:10,00:01:11,Three people.
00:01:11,00:01:12,I thought you said a sedan chair each.
00:01:12,00:01:13,"No, no, no."
00:01:13,00:01:15,"So we'll need three people, one sedan chair and then one of us to be the pedestrian who"
00:01:15,00:01:16,doesn't give way.
00:01:16,00:01:17,"Oh well I'll be the pedestrian, please."
00:01:17,00:01:18,Can I be the person'sâ€¦
00:01:18,00:01:20,"I'll be in the chair, shotgun in the chair."
00:01:20,00:01:21,Dang.
00:01:21,00:01:22,"All right, front, front."
00:01:22,00:01:23,I got the front.
00:01:23,00:01:24,Yes.
00:01:24,00:01:26,What a joke.
00:01:26,00:01:27,Sorry James.
00:01:27,00:01:28,God.
00:01:28,00:01:33,"Anyway, this was the other rules of the road or in fact the rules of the pavement in the"
00:01:33,00:01:37,"great sedan chair era, which is quite a short era really and just in case you're unfamiliar"
00:01:37,00:01:42,"with the sedan concept, it's obviously a chair that one person is sitting on and then"
00:01:42,00:01:46,it's attached to sort of pole railings and those are held by one person at each end and
00:01:46,00:01:48,you're walked around the street in this chair.
00:01:48,00:01:51,"And normally there's a box around the chair, we should say."
00:01:51,00:01:52,Yeah.
00:01:52,00:01:54,There's some rough and ready sedan chairs where it's literally just a chair and you're
00:01:54,00:01:55,being carried.
00:01:55,00:01:56,Really?
00:01:56,00:01:57,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:01:57,00:01:58,You can't see that.
00:01:58,00:01:59,Very cheap fit for those.
00:01:59,00:02:04,There were military sedan chairs or for expeditions and it's literally just a chair with some
00:02:04,00:02:05,handles that fold out.
00:02:05,00:02:06,Right.
00:02:06,00:02:07,And that's it.
00:02:07,00:02:10,"You wouldn't have thought it was that useful in a sort of military assault, would you?"
00:02:10,00:02:11,It's no tank.
00:02:11,00:02:12,The sedan chair.
00:02:12,00:02:13,It's free.
00:02:13,00:02:14,It's before the battle.
00:02:14,00:02:15,"Okay, right."
00:02:15,00:02:16,You're in the chair.
00:02:16,00:02:17,Galloping in on the sedan chair.
00:02:17,00:02:22,"Over the lip of a hill, thousands of sedan chairs."
00:02:22,00:02:27,"Anyway, yeah, there were quite strict rules about how they could be used."
00:02:27,00:02:34,"So it was in 1634, I think, that they really kicked off in the UK."
00:02:34,00:02:39,They came over from Europe and a guy called Saunders Duncombe got a bunch of licenses
00:02:39,00:02:42,to hire out some sedan chairs.
00:02:42,00:02:45,"And the great thing about them was they were allowed to go on the pavements, much like scooters"
00:02:45,00:02:49,"and there's much like scooters, it's really irritated pedestrians."
00:02:49,00:02:52,But the rule was that pedestrians had to get out the way and the men on this who would
00:02:52,00:02:57,"be carrying the sedan chairs and it was usually men, obviously, would just shout, you know,"
00:02:57,00:03:01,"buy or leave as they approached or sometimes rude of things, according to some accounts."
00:03:01,00:03:03,I thought that it was very polite.
00:03:03,00:03:07,I thought a sedan chair would be making its way leisurely to you and they would say you'd
00:03:07,00:03:08,pause.
00:03:08,00:03:09,These guys were bolting down the street.
00:03:09,00:03:10,Yeah.
00:03:10,00:03:11,Really?
00:03:11,00:03:12,"Yeah, that's the thing."
00:03:12,00:03:13,"If you didn't move, you weren't sort of in a standoff."
00:03:13,00:03:14,You were just mowed over.
00:03:14,00:03:17,That's why I think like this was the rule.
00:03:17,00:03:20,"But it was kind of an unwritten rule, I reckon, right?"
00:03:20,00:03:22,"Because and the reason it was unwritten was because if you didn't get out of the way,"
00:03:22,00:03:23,you would get smashed.
00:03:23,00:03:24,Yeah.
00:03:24,00:03:25,Yeah.
00:03:25,00:03:26,"They could be quite, quite violent."
00:03:26,00:03:30,"I always thought that sedan chairs were pretty much in the way that you might, if you're"
00:03:30,00:03:33,"in London these days, you know, getting a rickshaw in the middle of the night."
00:03:33,00:03:37,"Like it was just a thing of convenience, which was really nice, but actually they were really"
00:03:37,00:03:38,practical.
00:03:38,00:03:42,"They were particularly practical for people whose legs, you know, had problems who couldn't"
00:03:42,00:03:44,walk and so on.
00:03:44,00:03:46,And sedan chairs weren't just for the outside.
00:03:46,00:03:49,"You had indoor sedan chairs, which I just didn't think of."
00:03:49,00:03:53,"So you could get, you could get from your room downstairs and have a wash, go out."
00:03:53,00:03:56,"I think it was, it was usually the same sedan chair, right?"
00:03:56,00:03:59,What they would do is they would change the poles so they would have shorter poles when
00:03:59,00:04:03,you were doing the indoor bits and then they would give you longer ones for the outdoor.
00:04:03,00:04:06,So they were really popular in Bath in the city of Bath.
00:04:06,00:04:09,"They were, like Dan said, because you could use them indoors."
00:04:09,00:04:12,You could literally be picked up from your bed in your lodgings.
00:04:12,00:04:15,"You could be carried to the bath waters, which were regenerative."
00:04:15,00:04:19,You could be put into the waters and then picked back up again and taken back to your
00:04:19,00:04:20,bed and put into your bed.
00:04:20,00:04:24,"And these guys, the chairman, who would take you, they would also strip you and cover you"
00:04:24,00:04:26,in blankets.
00:04:26,00:04:29,"So they would take off your nightclothes, put you in blankets, put you in the sedan chair,"
00:04:29,00:04:33,"take you to the baths, put you in and then put you back as you were."
00:04:33,00:04:35,It's like being a baby.
00:04:35,00:04:36,Yeah.
00:04:36,00:04:37,"Basically, I'm being a..."
00:04:37,00:04:38,I just think Uber should bring this in.
00:04:38,00:04:39,I don't want...
00:04:39,00:04:44,I think workers' rights might have got to a place where we wouldn't be able to sit in
00:04:44,00:04:45,the sedan chair anymore.
00:04:45,00:04:46,Yeah.
00:04:46,00:04:47,"There's a bit like a hover wheel chair, isn't it?"
00:04:47,00:04:48,Like you're...
00:04:48,00:04:49,Yeah.
00:04:49,00:04:50,Did you think about it?
00:04:50,00:04:51,"It's like, you know..."
00:04:51,00:04:52,Hovering no wheels.
00:04:52,00:04:53,"Just like, you know, an old..."
00:04:53,00:04:54,An old...
00:04:54,00:04:55,Like the concept.
00:04:55,00:04:56,It's a hovering chair.
00:04:56,00:04:59,"If you imagine the men who are carrying you aren't there, then it is, isn't it?"
00:04:59,00:05:00,Yeah.
00:05:00,00:05:01,Imagine they are the wheels.
00:05:01,00:05:02,The men are the wheels.
00:05:02,00:05:03,They were...
00:05:03,00:05:04,So they were mostly for the higher society.
00:05:04,00:05:05,Yes.
00:05:05,00:05:07,"Obviously, because you had to pay fares to ride in them."
00:05:07,00:05:10,"And so they had great fixtures, like they tended to have hinged roofs, especially as"
00:05:10,00:05:16,"hairstyles got bigger so that people's hair, big hairstyles would fit out on top or headdresses"
00:05:16,00:05:17,or top hats.
00:05:17,00:05:21,"I saw a drawing as well, which, again, it's done in that style where you kind of wonder,"
00:05:21,00:05:23,is this being satirical or is this being real?
00:05:23,00:05:27,But you can see the hinge on the top of the roof and this giant wig coming out.
00:05:27,00:05:28,"Now, obviously, one of the problems is if..."
00:05:28,00:05:29,What if it's raining?
00:05:29,00:05:30,Or what if there's a light drizzle?
00:05:30,00:05:32,You're obviously going to get your wig wet.
00:05:32,00:05:39,"So the person on behind, in James's position, they have on their back a sort of huge pole"
00:05:39,00:05:42,that comes up with an umbrella on the top and that then sits over.
00:05:42,00:05:45,"I think it's a satirical drawing, sadly."
00:05:45,00:05:48,"But it's kind of makes sense that you would do that, I would say."
00:05:48,00:05:49,Yeah.
00:05:49,00:05:50,Yeah.
00:05:50,00:05:54,"I think from the attitudes of the chairman that I can gather, their vibe would be, ""Your"
00:05:54,00:05:57,"hair can bloody well get wet, madam."""
00:05:57,00:06:00,So there was a thing as sedentary sickness.
00:06:00,00:06:01,"Oh, yeah."
00:06:01,00:06:06,"I think sedentaries were huge in China, too, and in Hong Kong as well."
00:06:06,00:06:10,And sea sickness was known as sedentary sickness because that was the best example they had.
00:06:10,00:06:14,I think more people might have experienced sedentaries than the ocean.
00:06:14,00:06:15,No way.
00:06:15,00:06:16,Yeah.
00:06:16,00:06:18,So you went out to sea and you suffer from sedentary sickness.
00:06:18,00:06:19,"Oh, possible."
00:06:19,00:06:20,I don't know if they called it that when they were at sea.
00:06:20,00:06:22,"Oh, I thought you were saying that was what they called sea sickness."
00:06:22,00:06:27,"I think if you're a salty old sea dog, you're probably still called it sea sickness."
00:06:27,00:06:28,Yeah.
00:06:28,00:06:31,"But I think most people would have said, ""Oh, I've got a sedentary sickness."""
00:06:31,00:06:35,"Because it feels like I've been in a sedentary, if they had motion sickness."
00:06:35,00:06:39,"If they'd been on the waltzes or whatever, they would think of it as sedentary sickness."
00:06:39,00:06:46,"But cures included drinking the urine of young boys, which does seem to crop up quite a lot"
00:06:46,00:06:47,in ancient cures.
00:06:47,00:06:50,"Was that in, would you get a little vial of that in the sedentary?"
00:06:50,00:06:51,For a nice one.
00:06:51,00:06:52,"Just if you felt it coming on, yeah."
00:06:52,00:06:55,"Well, like when the Uber driver has a bottle of water in his back, you know, it's the classy"
00:06:55,00:06:56,one.
00:06:56,00:06:57,Sedan lux.
00:06:57,00:07:03,"Yeah, or bringing some earth from your kitchen floor for protection."
00:07:03,00:07:07,"Well, that was how they used to treat sea sickness, I think we've said before, right?"
00:07:07,00:07:11,"Ah, so it must have been the urine of young boys for the sedentary only."
00:07:11,00:07:12,Okay.
00:07:12,00:07:16,"Also, taxi drivers get annoyed if you get their cars dirty."
00:07:16,00:07:20,"So if you bring earth into a car, and similarly with the sedentary, they used to, they were"
00:07:20,00:07:22,able to charge passengers for any mess that was made.
00:07:22,00:07:26,"So I think if you dumped a bunch of earth in the chair, or if you drank some young boys"
00:07:26,00:07:30,"urine, and then vomited it back up, but that's presumably fine."
00:07:30,00:07:34,"Because they're the ones who introduced the boys urine into the, yeah, just don't spill"
00:07:34,00:07:35,it.
00:07:35,00:07:39,"And I really like it how when it got to nighttime, the sedentary, the price would then double"
00:07:39,00:07:41,on top of all these other fees that you had.
00:07:41,00:07:42,It would double.
00:07:42,00:07:47,"It kind of makes sense because you needed one extra member of the vehicle, as it were,"
00:07:47,00:07:53,which was the link boy who would be standing in front of the sedentary with a torch lighting
00:07:53,00:07:55,the way like a big old headlight.
00:07:55,00:07:57,"You know, so cool."
00:07:57,00:08:01,"And it was, I read a thing about that was very dark and jolting in the sedan because"
00:08:01,00:08:04,"there are these just slight gaps of light where the curtains are or whatever, or you"
00:08:04,00:08:05,see the torch.
00:08:05,00:08:09,"And at the end of the journey, the link boy would thrust their flombo into your trumpet"
00:08:09,00:08:10,shaped extinguisher.
00:08:10,00:08:11,How cool is that?
00:08:11,00:08:12,Yeah.
00:08:12,00:08:13,That was if you paid extra though.
00:08:13,00:08:18,"And those extinguishers, you still see them in houses sometimes, don't you?"
00:08:18,00:08:21,I walked past the building yesterday and I saw this weird iron trumpet on the outside
00:08:21,00:08:25,and it was for them to stick the torture and extinguish is it?
00:08:25,00:08:26,That's great.
00:08:26,00:08:27,Cool is that?
00:08:27,00:08:30,"If you ever need to put out a candle in London and you happen to be in the right place, you"
00:08:30,00:08:31,can do it.
00:08:31,00:08:32,It's quite sushi buildings.
00:08:32,00:08:33,It's not.
00:08:33,00:08:34,Yes.
00:08:34,00:08:35,"This was in, you know, Piccadilly or somewhere."
00:08:35,00:08:36,Yeah.
00:08:36,00:08:38,"If look, if you live in one of those buildings, you can probably afford a torch, so you won't"
00:08:38,00:08:41,need to put the candle out in there.
00:08:41,00:08:45,The world record longest journey in a sedentary.
00:08:45,00:08:47,I'm not sure if it's still the world record.
00:08:47,00:08:53,"But this was in 1728, it was Princess Amelia, who's the daughter of King George II."
00:08:53,00:08:58,And she was carried from London to Bath in a sedentary.
00:08:58,00:08:59,So far.
00:08:59,00:09:00,Wow.
00:09:00,00:09:01,It's a long way.
00:09:01,00:09:05,She must have got through so much young boys urine on the way.
00:09:05,00:09:10,"They have like service stations where you can get some young boys urine, some drive-throughs"
00:09:10,00:09:14,and stuff.
00:09:14,00:09:21,It's 172 kilometres and she did it with eight chairmen working in turn and they had a coach
00:09:21,00:09:25,that was going alongside him that they would jump in and out of and then they would carry
00:09:25,00:09:26,her.
00:09:26,00:09:27,Who was it?
00:09:27,00:09:28,Who did this?
00:09:28,00:09:29,Princess Amelia.
00:09:29,00:09:30,So an actual princess.
00:09:30,00:09:31,"Yeah, daughter of George II."
00:09:31,00:09:32,Wow.
00:09:32,00:09:33,It wouldn't be your average pleb would it?
00:09:33,00:09:34,"No, no, of course."
00:09:34,00:09:38,"But what this reminds me of, every so often there's a new story today, which is like this"
00:09:38,00:09:41,drunk person got an Uber 200 miles.
00:09:41,00:09:47,"That was the first thing I thought I was like, but she was really kind of quite unpopular"
00:09:47,00:09:48,Princess Amelia.
00:09:48,00:09:52,She famously closed Richmond Park to anyone apart from her friends.
00:09:52,00:09:53,Bastard.
00:09:53,00:09:54,In London.
00:09:54,00:09:59,And so you had to get a ticket to go to Richmond Park and you had to get it from Princess Amelia.
00:09:59,00:10:01,You couldn't get it from anywhere else.
00:10:01,00:10:07,"And so for instance, there was a guy called Lord Barock who asked her for a ticket and"
00:10:07,00:10:09,"he said, ""Can I have a ticket to Richmond Park?"""
00:10:09,00:10:12,"And she said, ""I denied one to the Lord Chancellor."
00:10:12,00:10:14,"I'm hardly going to give one to you."""
00:10:14,00:10:15,Ouch.
00:10:15,00:10:16,Wow.
00:10:16,00:10:18,It was like a huge sort of right to roam thing.
00:10:18,00:10:22,"And there was a guy called John Lewis who took her to court saying, ""I should be allowed"
00:10:22,00:10:24,"into Richmond Park."""
00:10:24,00:10:28,"And in the end, this was in 1758, he won, John Lewis won."
00:10:28,00:10:32,And so they had to put ladders up over the walls so that people could get into Richmond
00:10:32,00:10:33,Park.
00:10:33,00:10:37,But Princess Amelia made it so that the steps in the ladder were too far that people could
00:10:37,00:10:38,get off.
00:10:38,00:10:39,Oh no.
00:10:39,00:10:41,So they had to go back to court to get them put in.
00:10:41,00:10:43,How was she getting in?
00:10:43,00:10:48,"She was, you know, she had her gates that she could go into that would guard and stuff"
00:10:48,00:10:49,like that.
00:10:49,00:10:50,"Oh, I see."
00:10:50,00:10:51,Okay.
00:10:51,00:10:54,She didn't have a human trebuchet or something tossing her in the house.
00:10:54,00:10:58,"But yeah, John Lewis who did this, he became like a local celebrity and people who lived"
00:10:58,00:11:03,near Richmond Park would have his painting in their houses because he was so famous for
00:11:03,00:11:04,getting people into Richmond Park.
00:11:04,00:11:05,How cool is that?
00:11:05,00:11:06,"Yeah, Princess Amelia."
00:11:06,00:11:07,Hang on.
00:11:07,00:11:11,"So could we say that without the sedanshire, we might not be able to access Richmond Park"
00:11:11,00:11:12,today?
00:11:12,00:11:13,No.
00:11:13,00:11:16,"Well, it's another one of my talking about someone quite a long way from the actual"
00:11:16,00:11:17,fact.
00:11:17,00:11:18,Yeah.
00:11:18,00:11:20,I'm only talking about her because she did have the record for the longest sedanshire
00:11:20,00:11:21,race.
00:11:21,00:11:25,"And just very quickly on the trip, you said that these guys were jumping out."
00:11:25,00:11:27,So was it like passing a baton?
00:11:27,00:11:30,"As in, did she ever touch the ground, we know, or was it just one journey?"
00:11:30,00:11:32,That's a really good point.
00:11:32,00:11:34,"I would imagine, she's a princess, right?"
00:11:34,00:11:38,Do you reckon it's uncomfortable to be put down and picked up again?
00:11:38,00:11:42,"Because if it is, they probably did a pass, baton pass to try and make it as good as possible"
00:11:42,00:11:43,for her.
00:11:43,00:11:47,But it's also uncomfortable to walk 170 miles without a piss.
00:11:47,00:11:49,So I imagine she would have stopped the bet along the way.
00:11:49,00:11:50,Yeah.
00:11:50,00:11:51,There must have been.
00:11:51,00:11:52,Yeah.
00:11:52,00:11:53,"Hardly any of them had toilets inside the sedanshire, did they?"
00:11:53,00:11:54,So...
00:11:54,00:11:57,"For that one, you would build that in, wouldn't you, for that long a journey?"
00:11:57,00:12:01,"That's a rough gig for the guy at the back, is what I'm saying."
00:12:01,00:12:02,"Oh, no."
00:12:02,00:12:06,What I'm thinking now is this is just so obvious that this must have happened.
00:12:06,00:12:11,"You get your free vial of young boys urine, neck it to make you feel better, and then"
00:12:11,00:12:14,you need a piss where you're going to go in that vial.
00:12:14,00:12:18,"And then the next person who uses the taxi, they're not going to get young boys urine."
00:12:18,00:12:19,"Yeah, you're right."
00:12:19,00:12:23,"And if they get the motion so it was badly, they'll think, ""I bet that wasn't young"
00:12:23,00:12:29,"boys urine, after all, only four stars."""
00:12:29,00:12:39,"Okay, it is time for fact number two, and that is James."
00:12:39,00:12:45,"Okay, my fact this week is that a woman called Mary Papa Nicolaou once had a smear test"
00:12:45,00:12:48,every day for 21 years.
00:12:48,00:12:52,I thought he's been a hypochondriac.
00:12:52,00:12:53,That is...
00:12:53,00:12:55,"I mean, it's quite something, isn't it?"
00:12:55,00:13:03,"No, she was the wife of Dr. Georgios Papa Nicolaou, who was the guy who invented the"
00:13:03,00:13:08,"PAP smear test, and that's why it's called the PAP test, because it's named after him."
00:13:08,00:13:14,"And he needed to do experiments, and it's kind of hard to get people to do experiments,"
00:13:14,00:13:20,"and so he got his wife to do it, and she unbregrudgingly, or maybe a little bit begrudgingly, did this"
00:13:20,00:13:21,for 21 years.
00:13:21,00:13:27,"It depends on the day, doesn't it, if it's Christmas day, or your birthday."
00:13:27,00:13:33,"So the other thing is that he was a zoologist, really, and he came up with this idea of doing"
00:13:33,00:13:41,"a smear of the vagina of a guinea pig, and he could find out when they were menstruating,"
00:13:41,00:13:45,"and so he was kind of doing that experiment on humans, and everyone's like, ""Yeah, but"
00:13:45,00:13:48,"we kind of know when humans are menstruating, it's a bit dumb."""
00:13:48,00:13:49,But there is an obvious sign.
00:13:49,00:13:54,"There's the odd sign here and there, but what happened was Mary invited some of her friends"
00:13:54,00:13:59,"to a party, and I don't know how you bring this up in the party, but as part of the party,"
00:13:59,00:14:07,"they all had a smear test, and then one of her friends was diagnosed with cervical cancer,"
00:14:07,00:14:12,"and Georgios Papa Nicolaou, he had the smear, and he managed to see that there was something"
00:14:12,00:14:17,"in that smear that pre-saged the fact that she was going to get cervical cancer, and"
00:14:17,00:14:20,that was basically why we have smear tests today.
00:14:20,00:14:21,So brilliant.
00:14:21,00:14:22,What a hero.
00:14:22,00:14:23,"Like, he should be a household name, really."
00:14:23,00:14:24,"Well, she should be, as well."
00:14:24,00:14:25,Both of them should be.
00:14:25,00:14:26,"Yeah, the Papa Nicolaou's should be."
00:14:26,00:14:27,She should just lay there.
00:14:27,00:14:30,"As the only person among the four of us who's had a smear test, it's genuinely not that"
00:14:30,00:14:31,difficult.
00:14:31,00:14:32,21 years in a row.
00:14:32,00:14:33,It's not very pleasant.
00:14:33,00:14:34,I understand.
00:14:34,00:14:35,It's not that pleasant.
00:14:35,00:14:36,No.
00:14:36,00:14:37,"So it's a sort of little, what is it about?"
00:14:37,00:14:41,A little sort of taking of a few cells from the inside of the vagina.
00:14:41,00:14:42,"Yeah, exactly."
00:14:42,00:14:43,"So it's something, a little speculum."
00:14:43,00:14:45,"I imagine, I really want to know who made the tiny speculum for this guy's guinea pig."
00:14:45,00:14:46,I can tell you that.
00:14:46,00:14:52,"So he went to, he went to a shop and bought a nasal speculum for humans."
00:14:52,00:14:55,So a speculum is something that kind of opens up a gap a little bit.
00:14:55,00:15:00,And so he would take the nasal speculum for humans and used it in the vaginas of the guinea
00:15:00,00:15:01,pigs.
00:15:01,00:15:05,And so what that tells me is that guinea pig's vagina is almost exactly the same size as
00:15:05,00:15:06,a human nostril.
00:15:06,00:15:07,Oh.
00:15:07,00:15:10,"Oh, well that's, it's useful knowledge probably somewhere."
00:15:10,00:15:12,It's going to be useful at some point.
00:15:12,00:15:13,One day.
00:15:13,00:15:14,A pub quiz.
00:15:14,00:15:15,What a pub quiz.
00:15:15,00:15:16,The pub quiz as I go.
00:15:16,00:15:17,The pub quiz as I set.
00:15:17,00:15:18,Oh my God.
00:15:18,00:15:19,I just can't see the sec.
00:15:19,00:15:20,I want to.
00:15:20,00:15:21,I've desperately tried.
00:15:21,00:15:22,But we have a lot of listeners.
00:15:22,00:15:27,"There's like, how many people listening to this show?"
00:15:27,00:15:28,One day.
00:15:28,00:15:29,Just a little bit.
00:15:29,00:15:33,"I reckon maybe you're going buying some nose plugs, right, as you're a swimmer and you"
00:15:33,00:15:37,"go to the nose plug shop and they say, you're not allowed to put them in your nose before"
00:15:37,00:15:38,you buy them.
00:15:38,00:15:41,"And you're like, luckily I have a guinea pig here."
00:15:41,00:15:45,So I can test the size of the guinea pig instead of testing it on myself.
00:15:45,00:15:47,And that's the loophole in the chemist rule.
00:15:47,00:15:50,We don't have any rule that says you can't put them in a guinea pig vagina.
00:15:50,00:15:55,"Oh, I've seen it where it's like someone's being held captive by an eccentric billionaire"
00:15:55,00:15:59,"and they're like, I'm about to kill you unless you can answer this impossible question."
00:15:59,00:16:00,That's quite good.
00:16:00,00:16:01,I'll be.
00:16:01,00:16:02,I've got another one.
00:16:02,00:16:08,So you're being held captive by this guy and he wants to put some poison in your nose.
00:16:08,00:16:12,"And so what you do is, oh, no, I need to put my hockey mask on first and you put your hockey"
00:16:12,00:16:13,mask on.
00:16:13,00:16:16,"He begrudgingly says, oh, that's, I understand."
00:16:16,00:16:21,"But then when you've got your mask on, you put a guinea pig where he thinks your nose"
00:16:21,00:16:22,is.
00:16:22,00:16:26,And so he puts the poison in the guinea pig's vagina instead of your nose because he fixes
00:16:26,00:16:27,your nose.
00:16:27,00:16:28,Yeah.
00:16:28,00:16:29,That's quite good.
00:16:29,00:16:30,Yeah.
00:16:30,00:16:31,"Anyway, look."
00:16:31,00:16:32,God.
00:16:32,00:16:33,Papa Niccolo.
00:16:33,00:16:34,Yeah.
00:16:34,00:16:39,"So George asked the husband, he started working on the guinea pigs during the First World"
00:16:39,00:16:44,"War, I think it was about 1916, maybe within a year or two either side because that was"
00:16:44,00:16:45,the length of the war.
00:16:45,00:16:47,But it took him so long.
00:16:47,00:16:52,"He published his landmark work on it during the Second World War, it was 1943 that the"
00:16:52,00:16:53,work was published.
00:16:53,00:16:58,And that was with a brilliantly named fellow scientist called Herbert Trout.
00:16:58,00:17:02,"Just on very quickly on Trout, Herbert Trout, because I know you want to know this."
00:17:02,00:17:05,I read his obituary and he loved fishing.
00:17:05,00:17:06,Brilliant.
00:17:06,00:17:07,Lovely.
00:17:07,00:17:08,Good on you.
00:17:08,00:17:09,Very good.
00:17:09,00:17:11,What is truly amazing about this though is one article that I read is that in the early
00:17:11,00:17:17,"1900s, cervical cancer was the number one cancer killer in women in the USA."
00:17:17,00:17:21,And now it's basically the most preventable cancer up there.
00:17:21,00:17:29,"I mean, it's extraordinary what this guy's discovery along with his wife's vagina did."
00:17:29,00:17:37,"Another good name in the history of Smith's is the sort of simultaneous inventor, in fact,"
00:17:37,00:17:38,Oral Babes.
00:17:38,00:17:39,Stop it.
00:17:39,00:17:40,"Yeah, stop it."
00:17:40,00:17:41,That's not real.
00:17:41,00:17:43,How do you actually pronounce it Anna?
00:17:43,00:17:44,All right.
00:17:44,00:17:45,Fine.
00:17:45,00:17:46,I think you probably say Oral Babes.
00:17:46,00:17:47,It's Oral Babesh.
00:17:47,00:17:54,Oral Babesh is the name of the person who was Romanian I think and he also was doing experiments
00:17:54,00:17:58,around the same time and sort of came up with a slightly different twist on taking a cervical
00:17:58,00:18:01,smear test at the same time.
00:18:01,00:18:02,Right.
00:18:02,00:18:03,And yeah.
00:18:03,00:18:06,"And in fact, in Romania, it's called the method of Babesh of Papa Nicolaou."
00:18:06,00:18:07,Wow.
00:18:07,00:18:09,So they give him joint credit for it.
00:18:09,00:18:10,Cool.
00:18:10,00:18:11,"He was, by the way, Babesh."
00:18:11,00:18:14,He worked with Robert Bunsen of Bunsen burner fame.
00:18:14,00:18:15,Stop.
00:18:15,00:18:16,Yeah.
00:18:16,00:18:17,Wow.
00:18:17,00:18:18,He was his pupil.
00:18:18,00:18:20,I thought Bunsen burner was kind of hundreds of years old.
00:18:20,00:18:23,I thought they were back over a hundred years old.
00:18:23,00:18:24,Okay.
00:18:24,00:18:25,That is really cool.
00:18:25,00:18:26,It's so cool.
00:18:26,00:18:27,"God, so many great names being chucked around."
00:18:27,00:18:28,I know.
00:18:28,00:18:33,"In 2009, Papa Nicolaou at George else, again, was named the second greatest Greek of all"
00:18:33,00:18:35,time in a national poll.
00:18:35,00:18:39,"I mean, that's of all the countries, that's a biggie grease, isn't it?"
00:18:39,00:18:41,It's one hundred percent is because they got a lot of pedigree in there.
00:18:41,00:18:42,Yeah.
00:18:42,00:18:44,He was beaten by one man only.
00:18:44,00:18:46,Was it that guy who did?
00:18:46,00:18:47,Anassas.
00:18:47,00:18:48,Not anassas.
00:18:48,00:18:49,Oh.
00:18:49,00:18:53,"Well, who's that guy who did all the politics and the economics and stuff when they had"
00:18:53,00:18:54,a...
00:18:54,00:18:55,"Sure, it's like Socrates."
00:18:55,00:18:56,Yeah.
00:18:56,00:18:57,Was it him?
00:18:57,00:18:58,No.
00:18:58,00:18:59,"I think it should be Anas, but I think it's Socrates."
00:18:59,00:19:00,It's under the grade.
00:19:00,00:19:01,Oh.
00:19:01,00:19:04,The only Greek voted greater than George Papa Nicolaou.
00:19:04,00:19:07,What did the Macedonians think of that vote?
00:19:07,00:19:09,I don't know.
00:19:09,00:19:18,"I really love the speculum as said no woman ever as a historical object, I don't like"
00:19:18,00:19:25,"it too near me, but it's got a very interesting history, so it was invented by this chap called"
00:19:25,00:19:26,James Sims.
00:19:26,00:19:29,He was actually a very unsavory character in pretty much every way.
00:19:29,00:19:30,Wow.
00:19:30,00:19:35,"At the time, doctors were totally discouraged from looking at women's private parts."
00:19:35,00:19:41,"Gynecologists would be told not to look at the affected area, and they'd be..."
00:19:41,00:19:46,They were instructed to blindly fumble around under a lady's skirt and have a little bit
00:19:46,00:19:51,"of a feel, and I think there was even a textbook that suggested either the doctors stare determinedly"
00:19:51,00:19:56,out into the middle of space or look the person in the eye consistently as you're doing it.
00:19:56,00:19:57,Which is better.
00:19:57,00:19:59,Which is worse.
00:19:59,00:20:04,"But, yeah, he didn't like doing it any more than any other of these male doctors at the"
00:20:04,00:20:10,"time, and it was sort of as very unseemly, but he did say one time this poor girl came"
00:20:10,00:20:13,"to him with a fissure, a really bad fissure, and he said this girl was in such a condition"
00:20:13,00:20:17,that I was obliged to find out what was the matter with her.
00:20:17,00:20:21,"And so we started investigating ways to see into the vagina, and he tried a bent handle"
00:20:21,00:20:27,"of a gravy spoon at first, and I don't know if it was clean before it was eaten off again,"
00:20:27,00:20:30,"not clear on the details there, but it was really controversial."
00:20:30,00:20:34,"Even after he came up with a speculum, lots of people refused to use it in case it corrupted"
00:20:34,00:20:36,"people, in case women got very proud."
00:20:36,00:20:39,In case it was just too damn sexy.
00:20:39,00:20:41,It was exactly that.
00:20:41,00:20:45,And the thing about Sims is really controversial is that he did a lot of experiments on African
00:20:45,00:20:50,"American enslaved women, and there was a question about how much consent he got."
00:20:50,00:20:54,And to such an extent that his statue was removed from Central Park in 2018.
00:20:54,00:20:55,Was it?
00:20:55,00:20:56,"Yeah, it was."
00:20:56,00:21:00,"So, I mean, I think he's been roundly cancelled now, Mr Sims."
00:21:00,00:21:03,"Yeah, yeah, he's not a good guy."
00:21:03,00:21:08,Another person famous in the history of smear tests is Anna Marion Hilliard.
00:21:08,00:21:14,"She was a Canadian physician, and the pap test was invented by this Greek guy, but actually"
00:21:14,00:21:19,"she invented the way that they do it in modern days, because she made it much more simple,"
00:21:19,00:21:23,and she made it in a way that any gynecologist or family doctor could do it without having
00:21:23,00:21:24,to have loads of extra training.
00:21:24,00:21:27,"So she's really, really important in this story."
00:21:27,00:21:29,"As well as being a physician, she was a midwife."
00:21:29,00:21:34,She was one of the best women's hockey players in Canada in her day.
00:21:34,00:21:39,"And there was a brilliant interview with her, and they asked her about her life as a gynecologist."
00:21:39,00:21:44,"And she said that sometimes women would come up to her six years after their wedding day,"
00:21:44,00:21:48,and she would have to inform them that the reason that they still haven't had any babies
00:21:48,00:21:49,is that they are still virgins.
00:21:49,00:21:50,Whoa.
00:21:50,00:21:51,Yeah.
00:21:51,00:21:53,What is this?
00:21:53,00:21:55,This was in the '50s.
00:21:55,00:21:56,This interview was in 1957.
00:21:56,00:21:57,Okay.
00:21:57,00:21:59,"They were like, ""Why have I not had a baby yet?"""
00:21:59,00:22:02,"And they're like, ""Well, let me tell you something about life."""
00:22:02,00:22:05,"That's leaving it too late for the birds and the bees chat, isn't it?"
00:22:05,00:22:06,Yeah.
00:22:06,00:22:10,"It's also very fitting that she played hockey, because in terms of gynecological lessons,"
00:22:10,00:22:14,I was taught to apply condoms by putting them on hockey sticks by my English teacher.
00:22:14,00:22:15,Were you?
00:22:15,00:22:16,Yeah.
00:22:16,00:22:18,I was the first possible nod of my English teachers to this.
00:22:18,00:22:20,Why is your English teacher telling you to do this?
00:22:20,00:22:23,"It comes up in middle-march, do you remember this?"
00:22:23,00:22:26,"Dorothea has to pop, yeah, yeah, pop it on a hockey stick."
00:22:26,00:22:29,"Yeah, on Calzabon, it was quite difficult, because it was very fulfilling now."
00:22:29,00:22:31,"I thought, ""Oh, no, I'm thinking of ice hockey sticks."""
00:22:31,00:22:32,A hockey stick?
00:22:32,00:22:33,Which end is the hockey stick?
00:22:33,00:22:38,"I mean, isn't the hockey stick, like, 180 degrees curved at the end?"
00:22:38,00:22:39,Yeah.
00:22:39,00:22:40,And the old pipey again?
00:22:40,00:22:41,The gravy spoon.
00:22:41,00:22:42,That's what we call it.
00:22:42,00:22:52,"Okay, it is time for fact number three, and that is my fact."
00:22:52,00:22:57,My fact this week is that ships can squat to get under bridges.
00:22:57,00:22:59,That's really cool.
00:22:59,00:23:01,Pop a squat and get under bridges.
00:23:01,00:23:02,They don't have any legs.
00:23:02,00:23:03,They don't have any legs.
00:23:03,00:23:04,Obvious response.
00:23:04,00:23:05,"No, they can't."
00:23:05,00:23:06,What are you talking about?
00:23:06,00:23:07,So this is a pretty amazing thing.
00:23:07,00:23:12,"Basically, what they do in order to achieve the squat is they make the ship go faster."
00:23:12,00:23:16,"And when you move a ship faster, there's obviously a lot more water passing faster."
00:23:16,00:23:21,"And when it passes faster, particularly underneath the boat, the pressure decreases."
00:23:21,00:23:25,"And so the ship sinks further down into it, sort of gets sucked to the bottom."
00:23:25,00:23:27,And that's how they achieve it.
00:23:27,00:23:28,And they work out the measurements.
00:23:28,00:23:32,"They work out how much they need to go down, and that's the speed to which they move in"
00:23:32,00:23:35,order to gain that extra distance from a bridge.
00:23:35,00:23:37,And we've seen it happen a few times.
00:23:37,00:23:39,"I mean, it's pretty crazy."
00:23:39,00:23:41,There's one of the biggest cruise ships in the world.
00:23:41,00:23:43,It's called the Oasis of the Seas.
00:23:43,00:23:45,And it needed to do this.
00:23:45,00:23:50,It needed to get under a bridge that connects the Danish islands of Zeeland and Sprogo.
00:23:50,00:23:53,So it couldn't get under at the height that it was at.
00:23:53,00:23:56,And they did a few things like they had to collapse the tall standing funnels.
00:23:56,00:23:57,What could you do that?
00:23:57,00:23:58,"Yeah, yeah."
00:23:58,00:24:00,Some ships are built to do that specifically for bridges.
00:24:00,00:24:01,Yeah.
00:24:01,00:24:05,"I mean, but normally those ships are in bottles that can do that."
00:24:05,00:24:10,"So in this case, this particular ship could, the Oasis of the Seas, but it still wasn't"
00:24:10,00:24:11,enough.
00:24:11,00:24:14,So they needed to approach the bridge at 20 knots.
00:24:14,00:24:15,Oh my gosh.
00:24:15,00:24:16,So they did that.
00:24:16,00:24:18,"And if you get it wrong, then that's it."
00:24:18,00:24:19,You're going really fast.
00:24:19,00:24:20,You're going really fast into a bridge.
00:24:20,00:24:21,But it managed to do it.
00:24:21,00:24:24,And it made clearance by a foot.
00:24:24,00:24:28,"So they must have, I mean, imagine the maths for that, working out that this is exactly"
00:24:28,00:24:29,the right speed.
00:24:29,00:24:30,Yeah.
00:24:30,00:24:31,"That's a lot of pressure, isn't it?"
00:24:31,00:24:32,Yeah.
00:24:32,00:24:37,So I'm a mathematician just hearing this enormous crunch above deck and looking at your notes
00:24:37,00:24:40,"and going, ""Oh, I didn't carry the one."
00:24:40,00:24:41,"Oh no."""
00:24:41,00:24:42,Yeah.
00:24:42,00:24:45,"That bridge is called the Great Belt Bridge, right?"
00:24:45,00:24:46,In Denmark.
00:24:46,00:24:49,And I checked out whether it has been hit in the past.
00:24:49,00:24:52,It's been hit once since it was opened.
00:24:52,00:24:54,And that was by Karen Danielson.
00:24:54,00:24:56,Funny name for a ship.
00:24:56,00:24:57,That's the name of the ship.
00:24:57,00:24:58,You're joking.
00:24:58,00:25:04,I'm going to be Karen Danielson crashed into it in 2005 and because you couldn't get any
00:25:04,00:25:08,"traffic across, this is one of the main bridges from one of the most populous parts of Denmark"
00:25:08,00:25:09,to the rest of it.
00:25:09,00:25:14,It basically cut the whole of Denmark into two and no one could get from either side.
00:25:14,00:25:20,"Karen Danielson, as far as I can tell, must be named after Karen Danielson, who's a psychoanalyst"
00:25:20,00:25:23,because I can't find any other Karen Danielsons.
00:25:23,00:25:25,She might be better known to you as Karen Horney.
00:25:25,00:25:36,"No, she's a really, really famous psychoanalyst who is like a feminist Freudian, and Freud"
00:25:36,00:25:38,"has the theory of penis envy, right?"
00:25:38,00:25:42,Women are neurotic because they want to have penises and stuff like that.
00:25:42,00:25:47,"She invented something called womb envy in men, and she says that this is just as common"
00:25:47,00:25:51,"if not more common in men, and men are neurotic because they're envious of women's ability"
00:25:51,00:25:57,"to bear children, and whereas women fulfill their society simply by being here, men have"
00:25:57,00:26:01,to achieve their manhood by succeeding in life.
00:26:01,00:26:03,So that's Karen Horney.
00:26:03,00:26:06,"That's, well, speaking of invention, something I've always wanted to invent the name for,"
00:26:06,00:26:08,the opposite of nominative determinism.
00:26:08,00:26:11,"She's Horney, and so she's gone in the opposite direction."
00:26:11,00:26:14,She denies all the horny-ness that old Freud put forward.
00:26:14,00:26:18,"Yeah, according to Wikipedia, Horney was bewildered by psychiatrists' tendency to"
00:26:18,00:26:22,place so much emphasis on the male sexual organ.
00:26:22,00:26:27,"What a good reversal would be for nominative determinism, you could call it nominative"
00:26:27,00:26:28,deter-minism.
00:26:28,00:26:29,Yes.
00:26:29,00:26:30,So it's putting things off.
00:26:30,00:26:33,I watched that to you a while ago.
00:26:33,00:26:34,Sorry?
00:26:34,00:26:35,I watched that idea to you a while ago.
00:26:35,00:26:36,"Yeah, you did."
00:26:36,00:26:42,"And as I said it, I thought this bell went ding-a-ling of plagiarism alert, plagiarism alert, but"
00:26:42,00:26:49,"I thought, ignore the bell, because it was quiet enough that I thought, what are the"
00:26:49,00:26:55,odds of plagiarising someone in this room?
00:26:55,00:26:59,"I'm really looking forward to your court case, eventually, where when the IQ stands"
00:26:59,00:27:04,"up and explains what you've done, you just immediately go, ""Oh, yeah, no, you're right."
00:27:04,00:27:05,I did.
00:27:05,00:27:06,"Do you mind?"""
00:27:06,00:27:07,Yes.
00:27:07,00:27:12,"As I was stealing that loaf of bread and the little bell went off, I thought they must"
00:27:12,00:27:16,have been a boy wizard called Harry.
00:27:16,00:27:20,"Okay, well, can we go back to shipping?"
00:27:20,00:27:21,Yeah.
00:27:21,00:27:23,Let's have a ship fact.
00:27:23,00:27:26,"Oh, okay, so you want to hear a cool sinking ship fact?"
00:27:26,00:27:27,Yes.
00:27:27,00:27:31,"This is something I probably said three years ago, but something that someone else said"
00:27:31,00:27:33,three years ago.
00:27:33,00:27:39,"There are ships called, I'm so paranoid now, semi-submersible ships, they're called heavy"
00:27:39,00:27:40,lift ships as well.
00:27:40,00:27:41,Okay.
00:27:41,00:27:42,Is that going off?
00:27:42,00:27:43,No.
00:27:43,00:27:44,Great.
00:27:44,00:27:45,Thank you.
00:27:45,00:27:47,"What they do is, they're designed to carry other ships or they're designed to carry"
00:27:47,00:27:53,"oil rigs or they're designed to carry enormously heavy things, things that weigh tens of thousands"
00:27:53,00:27:54,of tonnes.
00:27:54,00:27:59,"What they do is, they're these weird, mad, huge platforms with towers at the corners."
00:27:59,00:28:01,They float along.
00:28:01,00:28:05,"They then take on huge amounts of water as ballast, millions and millions of litres,"
00:28:05,00:28:06,and they sink.
00:28:06,00:28:11,"The ship sinks, and then the oil rig or the other ship or whatever floats over the top."
00:28:11,00:28:12,Wow.
00:28:12,00:28:13,So clever.
00:28:13,00:28:16,"And then the submersible ship just jettisons all the ballast it took on, and Bob's back"
00:28:16,00:28:19,up bringing the thing with it.
00:28:19,00:28:20,Wow.
00:28:20,00:28:21,Nice.
00:28:21,00:28:22,It's insane.
00:28:22,00:28:24,It's absolutely insane.
00:28:24,00:28:27,"Some of them have feet to clamp onto the key as they're being loaded, so some ships have"
00:28:27,00:28:29,legs.
00:28:29,00:28:30,They're just nuts.
00:28:30,00:28:33,Did you guys ever read about the Sean O'Casey bridge in Dublin?
00:28:33,00:28:34,Sean O'Casey.
00:28:34,00:28:37,"Again, they say Karen Danielson, Sean O'Casey, and we just run out of names."
00:28:37,00:28:40,"I actually didn't look up who Sean was, I should have."
00:28:40,00:28:46,"There's a bridge that would open in the middle, but not long after they opened it, they lost"
00:28:46,00:28:52,"the remote control that opened the bridge, and they couldn't find it for four years."
00:28:52,00:28:53,Four years.
00:28:53,00:28:54,It didn't open.
00:28:54,00:28:58,"Well, that ship stuck in a traffic jam, the back up getting worse and worse."
00:28:58,00:29:01,Some pilot needed to get in for dinner.
00:29:01,00:29:02,And they found it.
00:29:02,00:29:03,They know they had to just get a new remote.
00:29:03,00:29:05,Why didn't they do that after three years?
00:29:05,00:29:09,"It's a slightly confusing story because from what I read, the cost wasn't even that great."
00:29:09,00:29:13,"It was only like, compared with the cost of a bridge or the shipping life of a nation."
00:29:13,00:29:14,Exactly.
00:29:14,00:29:15,I sometimes do that.
00:29:15,00:29:18,"You know, when you've lost your cheap headphones, you're like, ""I will find them."
00:29:18,00:29:21,"I know they're in my room somewhere."""
00:29:21,00:29:25,It's all in one small lounge that they've lost their remote control for the bridge.
00:29:25,00:29:28,"They just need to look in the sofa one more time, and it will be there."
00:29:28,00:29:29,Yeah.
00:29:29,00:29:30,My God.
00:29:30,00:29:37,"In 2020, there was a Donald Trump boat parade on Lake Travis, which was in the Colorado"
00:29:37,00:29:38,River.
00:29:38,00:29:41,"There were over a hundred boats, all pro-Trump, they had flags, and they were just having"
00:29:41,00:29:45,"a great day out doing it like, ""Do we support Donald Trump?"""
00:29:45,00:29:46,Whatever.
00:29:46,00:29:50,"Unfortunately, they generated massive waves, and five of them sank to the bottom of this"
00:29:50,00:29:51,lake.
00:29:51,00:29:53,And it was a completely calm day.
00:29:53,00:29:54,That's the thing.
00:29:54,00:29:55,"Oh, no."
00:29:55,00:29:56,And it's due to a really bizarre shipping effect.
00:29:56,00:30:01,"So basically, there were boats with planing hulls, which as far as I understand it is,"
00:30:01,00:30:05,"above a certain speed, the top rises up a bit, and the boat is effectively riding its"
00:30:05,00:30:07,own bow wave.
00:30:07,00:30:13,"The problem is that these boats, if they all go at the same speed, they kind of act on"
00:30:13,00:30:14,each other.
00:30:14,00:30:15,"Oh, yeah."
00:30:15,00:30:18,"And the waves that they're generating at 10 miles an hour, which was the speed they had"
00:30:18,00:30:21,"all decided to go at, was the worst possible speed to go at."
00:30:21,00:30:22,Nice.
00:30:22,00:30:27,"And so they created this enormous set of waves, which they created their own storm, basically."
00:30:27,00:30:28,"Oh, my God."
00:30:28,00:30:29,That's incredible.
00:30:29,00:30:30,I know.
00:30:30,00:30:31,I know.
00:30:31,00:30:32,"If they'd gone at five, it would have been fine."
00:30:32,00:30:33,"If they'd gone at 20, it would have been fine."
00:30:33,00:30:34,"Or if some had gone at five, and some had gone at 10, and some had gone at 12."
00:30:34,00:30:35,"Yeah, exactly."
00:30:35,00:30:36,"Yeah, yeah."
00:30:36,00:30:37,That was terrible.
00:30:37,00:30:38,It's quite impressive.
00:30:38,00:30:41,"If it had been intentional, that could be a useful naval military tactic, couldn't it?"
00:30:41,00:30:42,Yeah.
00:30:42,00:30:43,Better than the Old Sedanche.
00:30:43,00:30:44,How are we going to sink our own navy?
00:30:44,00:30:45,"Oh, yeah."
00:30:45,00:30:46,What's the tactic?
00:30:46,00:30:47,You need a mole.
00:30:47,00:30:48,You need a mole.
00:30:48,00:30:49,Yeah.
00:30:49,00:30:52,"You need to infiltrate the enemy navy, don't you?"
00:30:52,00:30:57,I was actually reading a bit more about the effect that you were talking about at the
00:30:57,00:30:58,start.
00:30:58,00:30:59,Yeah.
00:30:59,00:31:01,And so there are a few effects that ships can pull off.
00:31:01,00:31:02,Another one is the bank effect.
00:31:02,00:31:06,"This isn't actually a good thing, but it's very similar mechanism that Dan was talking"
00:31:06,00:31:07,about.
00:31:07,00:31:10,"So as you said, the ship goes faster and faster, and the water in front of it is displaced,"
00:31:10,00:31:11,"as we know, so you get that wave."
00:31:11,00:31:17,"And that creates a decrease in pressure underneath the ship, and that's called Bernouy's theorem."
00:31:17,00:31:22,"But also, it can create a decrease in pressure in the water around a ship's sides."
00:31:22,00:31:27,"So if a ship goes too fast, and then it turns a tiny bit accidentally or something, then"
00:31:27,00:31:32,"the pressure will be decreased, and so the ship will move to fill up that space of, you"
00:31:32,00:31:33,"know, decreased pressure."
00:31:33,00:31:34,"It'll get sucked in, kind of."
00:31:34,00:31:35,It gets sucked in.
00:31:35,00:31:38,"And that means as soon as you turn a corner, you can suddenly get sucked up onto a bank."
00:31:38,00:31:43,"And actually, it's posited that, you know, the ever-given that got stranded in the sewers"
00:31:43,00:31:46,"canary last year, was it?"
00:31:46,00:31:49,That that may have been what happened there.
00:31:49,00:31:52,"Just very quickly, I was reading an article in Hawkeye magazine."
00:31:52,00:31:53,Hawkeye magazine.
00:31:53,00:31:54,Your favorite mag.
00:31:54,00:31:55,My favorite mag.
00:31:55,00:31:56,Yeah.
00:31:56,00:32:01,It's about ships at sea and all the interesting methods that ships use for various different
00:32:01,00:32:06,"safety reasons, and one of which is if you look at a photo of a ship at sea, next time"
00:32:06,00:32:11,"you see a photo, have a look out for some people standing on deck, sort of on lookout."
00:32:11,00:32:15,"And that's two people, sometimes one, sometimes more."
00:32:15,00:32:18,"They're looking out for pirates, because that's a big problem when you're out at sea."
00:32:18,00:32:19,Sure.
00:32:19,00:32:21,"But the thing is, is that they're not real people."
00:32:21,00:32:25,"These ships have dummies that look like people, who they just place on the side."
00:32:25,00:32:26,Scarecrows.
00:32:26,00:32:27,Scarecrows.
00:32:27,00:32:28,Scarecrows.
00:32:28,00:32:29,For pirates.
00:32:29,00:32:30,Yeah.
00:32:30,00:32:31,Pretty cool.
00:32:31,00:32:35,"That was, I think it was in that article as well, that it said about, there was a passing"
00:32:35,00:32:39,comment about the metal discs that you see when big ships are moored.
00:32:39,00:32:44,"And next time you see a big ship moored, then you'll see that the ropes obviously tied"
00:32:44,00:32:50,"around the mooring pole, and then there's often a really big metal disc that looks like"
00:32:50,00:32:52,a giant CD that the ropes woven through.
00:32:52,00:32:55,"In fact, I think that almost always is with big boats."
00:32:55,00:32:59,"And if it's not down by the mooring, it's up against the side of the ship."
00:32:59,00:33:01,And do you know what that is for?
00:33:01,00:33:02,No.
00:33:02,00:33:03,No.
00:33:03,00:33:08,"So like the big CD that you get in taxis sometimes, is apparently they think that it will stop"
00:33:08,00:33:11,speed cameras from being able to catch you.
00:33:11,00:33:14,"It's not that, but I did not know that."
00:33:14,00:33:15,Really?
00:33:15,00:33:17,"I was told that by a taxi driver once, I don't know."
00:33:17,00:33:18,Right.
00:33:18,00:33:19,Okay.
00:33:19,00:33:20,"Oh, it doesn't work."
00:33:20,00:33:25,I was a little bit quite anxious in that taxi as he was going at 85 miles an hour and at
00:33:25,00:33:26,"20, so I got the CD."
00:33:26,00:33:29,"Calm yourself down, drink some of that young boys' beer and we'll be there in a minute."
00:33:29,00:33:30,Come on.
00:33:30,00:33:31,So it's not that.
00:33:31,00:33:32,It's not that.
00:33:32,00:33:33,It's not that.
00:33:33,00:33:34,It's a safety thing.
00:33:34,00:33:35,It's a rat stopper.
00:33:35,00:33:36,"Oh, really?"
00:33:36,00:33:37,"Oh, really?"
00:33:37,00:33:38,A big problem on ships.
00:33:38,00:33:39,Big problem in harbours.
00:33:39,00:33:41,Rat can't run up that rope if you've got a big CD in the way.
00:33:41,00:33:42,Brilliant.
00:33:42,00:33:43,It's amazing.
00:33:43,00:33:45,That article just talks about all the things on the side of a ship.
00:33:45,00:33:48,And I've never stopped to think about what I haven't really looked at the side of ships
00:33:48,00:33:49,too much in my time.
00:33:49,00:33:53,But it's basically covered in graffiti for the various things that you need to know.
00:33:53,00:33:58,So there'll be signs that will show you how far the ship can dip as a result of the weight
00:33:58,00:33:59,that it's carrying.
00:33:59,00:34:01,So here are the certain lines that you need to be aware of.
00:34:01,00:34:04,"And the lines, there are different lines because if you're going to be in saltwater"
00:34:04,00:34:08,versus freshwater versus sort of like tropical water as well.
00:34:08,00:34:09,Is that a flimsole line or something?
00:34:09,00:34:10,"Yeah, that's exactly it."
00:34:10,00:34:11,The flimsole.
00:34:11,00:34:12,The flimsole.
00:34:12,00:34:17,And then there's lines to show you that sometimes boats have this little protrusion at the bottom
00:34:17,00:34:19,"of the ship at the front, which you would never see."
00:34:19,00:34:22,"So when tugboats are coming out to get it, there's a little symbol."
00:34:22,00:34:27,It looks like a five that's missing the top that says watch out because you might smack
00:34:27,00:34:29,into something underwater.
00:34:29,00:34:33,"I think that's to stop the waves from, is it to help it aerodynamically or something?"
00:34:33,00:34:34,Yes.
00:34:34,00:34:35,"Yeah, yeah."
00:34:35,00:34:36,It's to break the waves somehow.
00:34:36,00:34:39,And it's pretty amazing that these giant ships are basically guided when they come
00:34:39,00:34:40,into shore.
00:34:40,00:34:45,"If they don't have a pilot doing the various, like very, very careful turning, basically"
00:34:45,00:34:51,"tugboats, just tiny little boats because they can't turn it, but those little things are"
00:34:51,00:34:53,able to shift an entire ship.
00:34:53,00:34:56,"And a maritime pilot, which I always think is quite cool that you have the pilots who"
00:34:56,00:35:00,wait in the harbors or at difficult channels like the Suez.
00:35:00,00:35:04,And these are the real pros who just know that very specific area of water and they
00:35:04,00:35:07,leap on the boat and tell you how to do it.
00:35:07,00:35:09,I saw that in action in Sydney at the Sydney Harbour.
00:35:09,00:35:13,So I was having a drink outside the Opera House and there was a cruise ship that was
00:35:13,00:35:14,going out.
00:35:14,00:35:17,And it's a very hard turn that it needs to make by the bridge.
00:35:17,00:35:23,"So they just have a pilot come on, get it out, and then he gets in a dinghy or a helicopter"
00:35:23,00:35:24,and just gets off the boat again.
00:35:24,00:35:25,That's it.
00:35:25,00:35:26,It's amazing.
00:35:26,00:35:27,Yeah.
00:35:27,00:35:28,"Not dissimilar to airline pilots, right?"
00:35:28,00:35:29,"They take off and land, but then when they're cruising..."
00:35:29,00:35:32,And then they jump off in the middle of the boat.
00:35:32,00:35:35,They get a helicopter off the plane at night.
00:35:35,00:35:39,"One more thing about boats and bridges from me, and that is about the Kinsey Street Bridge"
00:35:39,00:35:42,in Chicago.
00:35:42,00:35:46,This is a bridge going over a river and the bridge is kind of...
00:35:46,00:35:49,"It's mesh on the bottom, right?"
00:35:49,00:35:51,So it's to kind of make it easier to clean.
00:35:51,00:35:54,"If anything falls onto the road, it's just going to go straight down."
00:35:54,00:35:55,Do you know what I mean?
00:35:55,00:35:56,It's like a mesh.
00:35:56,00:35:57,Sort of.
00:35:57,00:35:58,"Because when he said mesh, I was thinking of a sieve and they're the hardest things"
00:35:58,00:35:59,to clean.
00:35:59,00:36:00,Absolutely right.
00:36:00,00:36:01,But absolutely right.
00:36:01,00:36:02,In this instance.
00:36:02,00:36:03,Yeah.
00:36:03,00:36:05,The holes are big enough that things can pass through like a sieve.
00:36:05,00:36:08,You're not going to get little bits of rice stuck in the culver.
00:36:08,00:36:12,The main traffic on the road is just loose rice.
00:36:12,00:36:15,"Anyway, so there's a band called the Dave Matthews Band."
00:36:15,00:36:16,Yeah.
00:36:16,00:36:17,"Yeah, you know, right?"
00:36:17,00:36:22,And they were gigging and the guy who was driving their bus decided that he was going
00:36:22,00:36:27,to dump all of their human waste as he drove over the Kinsey Street Bridge because he felt
00:36:27,00:36:28,"well, it's a mesh."
00:36:28,00:36:29,It just passed straight through.
00:36:29,00:36:30,Right?
00:36:30,00:36:31,So he did that.
00:36:31,00:36:32,This is in 2004.
00:36:32,00:36:37,"Unfortunately, at the same time as he did this, a tourist boat was going underneath"
00:36:37,00:36:38,the bridge.
00:36:38,00:36:39,Open top?
00:36:39,00:36:40,Open top.
00:36:40,00:36:41,Oh my God.
00:36:41,00:36:49,"And that incident led to more than three hundred thousand dollars in settlements, donations"
00:36:49,00:36:50,and fines.
00:36:50,00:36:51,Wow.
00:36:51,00:36:52,Really?
00:36:52,00:36:53,Yeah.
00:36:53,00:36:54,Oh my God.
00:36:54,00:36:58,And the Dave Matthews Band always now has agreed to keep a log of whenever it empties
00:36:58,00:36:59,its septic tanks.
00:36:59,00:37:00,"Keep a log, eh?"
00:37:00,00:37:10,Logs feel like they were the problem in the first place.
00:37:10,00:37:11,That's amazing.
00:37:11,00:37:15,"OK, it is time for our final fact of the show, and that is Andy."
00:37:15,00:37:20,My fact is that the art of wooden lacrosse stick making is extinct in the UK.
00:37:20,00:37:21,Oh no.
00:37:21,00:37:23,Is that global warming?
00:37:23,00:37:29,"I said it in a cheery way, but it's actually a very sad fact, obviously, because you can't"
00:37:29,00:37:31,go to wooden lacrosse stick in the UK anymore.
00:37:31,00:37:32,"Well, you can import one."
00:37:32,00:37:34,"Well, you can import one."
00:37:34,00:37:35,You can buy an old one.
00:37:35,00:37:38,"We've just done a whole section on massive ships, you know what they use massive ships"
00:37:38,00:37:39,for?
00:37:39,00:37:40,It is importing.
00:37:40,00:37:41,Lacrosse stick.
00:37:41,00:37:45,"This is a fact about, basically, I was on the website of the Heritage Crafts Organization,"
00:37:45,00:37:49,"which they're the advocates for traditional crafts, and they keep this amazing watch list"
00:37:49,00:37:54,"of traditional crafts, which are either fine, you know, sustainable, or slightly endangered,"
00:37:54,00:37:59,"or critically endangered, or extinct, and lacrosse stick making went extinct."
00:37:59,00:38:05,"In 2014, there's a phone called Hatter's Lease, which is the UK's main lacrosse stick manufacturer."
00:38:05,00:38:09,But their last wooden stick maker retired in 2014.
00:38:09,00:38:10,He was called Tom Beckett.
00:38:10,00:38:12,"Oh, Thomas Beckett."
00:38:12,00:38:13,Probably not.
00:38:13,00:38:16,"Well, no one rid me of this troublesome lacrosse stick maker."
00:38:16,00:38:20,"Yes, how did his life end, actually?"
00:38:20,00:38:23,He wasn't murdered on the steps of a...
00:38:23,00:38:24,He's still alive.
00:38:24,00:38:25,Tom Beckett.
00:38:25,00:38:26,There we go.
00:38:26,00:38:27,"Well, thank God."
00:38:27,00:38:29,Still goes for a curry every year with the rest of the people at Hatter's Lease.
00:38:29,00:38:30,Does he?
00:38:30,00:38:31,Yeah.
00:38:31,00:38:32,"James, you've been in touch with them."
00:38:32,00:38:33,I have.
00:38:33,00:38:36,What a blindingly good guess.
00:38:36,00:38:37,I have.
00:38:37,00:38:42,"I was asking them why they have a stick called the Victoria Cross, but Victoria was with"
00:38:42,00:38:47,"a K, and it's the best stick that they ever made, and I asked them why they called it the"
00:38:47,00:38:52,"Victoria Cross, and why it has a K, and neither Tom nor David Hay, who's the head of sales"
00:38:52,00:38:53,knew.
00:38:53,00:38:55,Because it's all plastic these days.
00:38:55,00:38:56,That's the sad thing.
00:38:56,00:38:57,Is it?
00:38:57,00:38:58,The lacrosse sticks.
00:38:58,00:38:59,Yeah.
00:38:59,00:39:00,Yeah.
00:39:00,00:39:01,Because they're lighter and they're more efficient.
00:39:01,00:39:07,"One reason is because they yield on impact, because it's quite a violent spot lacrosse,"
00:39:07,00:39:11,"and so if you hit someone across the head with a lacrosse stick, which is wooden, they're"
00:39:11,00:39:14,"going to do a lot of damage, but the carbon fiber ones bounce right off."
00:39:14,00:39:15,Yeah.
00:39:15,00:39:16,"It's all gone soft these days, hasn't it?"
00:39:16,00:39:19,You can't even beat people over the head with a stick anymore.
00:39:19,00:39:20,"Well, did you hear?"
00:39:20,00:39:21,Did you hear?
00:39:21,00:39:22,"I mean, that is an important thing."
00:39:22,00:39:23,It's a record.
00:39:23,00:39:24,Wheaton College.
00:39:24,00:39:25,Sorry.
00:39:25,00:39:26,Wheaton College.
00:39:26,00:39:27,Where were you educated?
00:39:27,00:39:28,Wheaton...
00:39:28,00:39:29,Eaton College.
00:39:29,00:39:30,Eaton College.
00:39:30,00:39:31,Really?
00:39:31,00:39:32,Yeah.
00:39:32,00:39:33,Wheaton College is the equivalent.
00:39:33,00:39:34,It's twinned.
00:39:34,00:39:35,It's twinned with Eaton.
00:39:35,00:39:38,"He was 19 at the time, called Alex Chew."
00:39:38,00:39:41,"It's the French Eaton, isn't it?"
00:39:41,00:39:44,"Meh, Wheaton."
00:39:44,00:39:48,"He was up until this point playing lacrosse his entire school life for the school teams,"
00:39:48,00:39:53,"and then he became a freshman at Wheaton College, and was told he couldn't play anymore because"
00:39:53,00:39:57,his head was too big for any of the helmets.
00:39:57,00:40:01,They just didn't make helmets big enough for this guy's head.
00:40:01,00:40:04,"I think what he used to do was, the reason he was allowed to play before was that he"
00:40:04,00:40:06,pieced together parts of two different helmets.
00:40:06,00:40:09,He created a bigger helmet for his massive head.
00:40:09,00:40:10,Does it sound very safe?
00:40:10,00:40:14,"You know, if you get two cars and weld them together, that's really unsafe, isn't it?"
00:40:14,00:40:15,"Yeah, exactly."
00:40:15,00:40:16,So he didn't get to play.
00:40:16,00:40:17,"Wait, sorry."
00:40:17,00:40:18,You need to sit on the sides.
00:40:18,00:40:21,Are the helmet makers of Massachusetts also extinct?
00:40:21,00:40:24,Is there no one available to make him?
00:40:24,00:40:26,No one built him a bigger helmet.
00:40:26,00:40:27,He couldn't play.
00:40:27,00:40:30,"He played, I think, one game that season, and I think that might have been a mistake."
00:40:30,00:40:31,You know what?
00:40:31,00:40:34,He could have played women's lacrosse because they don't wear helmets in women's lacrosse.
00:40:34,00:40:37,"No, not because it's almost a completely different game."
00:40:37,00:40:38,It's so weird.
00:40:38,00:40:39,"Yeah, it's so weird."
00:40:39,00:40:40,They're different sports.
00:40:40,00:40:44,"Well, so they say, I actually think they're really similar, but if you ask people who"
00:40:44,00:40:47,"play lacrosse of either type, they say they're really different sports, don't they?"
00:40:47,00:40:48,Yeah.
00:40:48,00:40:51,And they don't really do the body contact so much in women's sports.
00:40:51,00:40:53,So the men's lacrosse is incredibly violent.
00:40:53,00:40:59,"Basically, you can essentially just attack someone with a large stick, as long as it's"
00:40:59,00:41:04,"not deemed to be sort of like unduly really intentionally aggressive, I think."
00:41:04,00:41:06,"Whereas in women's, you can stick people."
00:41:06,00:41:07,You can stick people.
00:41:07,00:41:08,What do they call it?
00:41:08,00:41:09,Stick people?
00:41:09,00:41:10,Slashing and cocky?
00:41:10,00:41:14,"Stick check. In women's, you can stick check so you can hit their stick with your stick."
00:41:14,00:41:15,"Oh, okay."
00:41:15,00:41:16,You can't really bash them around the face.
00:41:16,00:41:19,Could you hit their fingers holding the stick with your stick?
00:41:19,00:41:20,I think you can do that.
00:41:20,00:41:21,"Oh, yeah."
00:41:21,00:41:23,"And I should say in men's, actually, you can't bash them around the face, but the torso,"
00:41:23,00:41:24,free for all.
00:41:24,00:41:25,Golly.
00:41:25,00:41:26,Really interesting.
00:41:26,00:41:28,And it's all down to a woman called Rosabelle Sinclair.
00:41:28,00:41:32,"And what happened was, so lacrosse is an old Native American sport."
00:41:32,00:41:36,"They played it in America, but it was in the early 20th century."
00:41:36,00:41:41,"Girls weren't really allowed to play lacrosse, and so it was an all-boy sport pretty much."
00:41:41,00:41:47,They came over to the UK and had an exhibition in front of Queen Victoria.
00:41:47,00:41:48,So this is a bit earlier.
00:41:48,00:41:53,And Queen Victoria said it would be a great game for girls to play in public schools.
00:41:53,00:41:55,And so they started playing it in public schools.
00:41:55,00:42:00,"And so you had this one spot in the UK, which was all girls playing in school."
00:42:00,00:42:03,"And you have this one spot in America, which was all boys playing, and they've kind of"
00:42:03,00:42:05,evolved quite differently.
00:42:05,00:42:11,"And then Rosabelle Sinclair took the girls' game over to America, but she decided she"
00:42:11,00:42:14,was going to stick to the girls' rules that they had in the UK.
00:42:14,00:42:18,"And so that's why now in America, it's almost like netball and basketball."
00:42:18,00:42:21,"Not quite, but they're quite different sports."
00:42:21,00:42:22,That makes sense.
00:42:22,00:42:26,"And I'd love to see a team of traditional women's lacrosse players play the men's,"
00:42:26,00:42:32,"because just FYI, if you're an American listener, lacrosse in the UK is pretty much, I think,"
00:42:32,00:42:36,"reserved for, well, this is an anecdote, this is just based on my own life experience."
00:42:36,00:42:41,"But in my own life experience, lacrosse is basically reserved for very posh school girls."
00:42:41,00:42:45,"And in America, it seems to be reserved for extremely hardcore, large men."
00:42:45,00:42:49,"So I was talking to someone the other day, a friend of mine who played a little bit of"
00:42:49,00:42:52,"lacrosse, and she said it is quite violent still."
00:42:52,00:42:56,"Yeah, it's pretty primal."
00:42:56,00:43:00,"So the kind of aggression of it, I think kind of makes sense for the origins of it."
00:43:00,00:43:02,So it was played in the 1500s.
00:43:02,00:43:08,"Native Americans did it as a way of kind of battling between local tribes, didn't they?"
00:43:08,00:43:12,"They sort of, they would have games that would last for days, and the teams could be anything"
00:43:12,00:43:15,from five players to over 100 players.
00:43:15,00:43:16,And it was...
00:43:16,00:43:19,You set up with your four mates.
00:43:19,00:43:24,"Oh, no, they've gone for the opposite, actually, in many ways."
00:43:24,00:43:29,"But yeah, that's kind of the origins of it, isn't it?"
00:43:29,00:43:34,"Yeah, there's one claim on the World Lacrosse Federation website, which says that sometimes"
00:43:34,00:43:37,"games can involve up to 100,000 players."
00:43:37,00:43:38,What?
00:43:38,00:43:44,"It's so clearly balanced, isn't it?"
00:43:44,00:43:46,"But that's what it claims in there, the authority."
00:43:46,00:43:47,That is amazing.
00:43:47,00:43:52,"It would certainly come and have over 1,000 people, and I thought it was true."
00:43:52,00:43:53,"100,000?"
00:43:53,00:43:54,Was it war?
00:43:54,00:43:56,"Or was it, were they fighting?"
00:43:56,00:43:57,"Well, we don't..."
00:43:57,00:43:58,That's still a big war.
00:43:58,00:43:59,It is.
00:43:59,00:44:00,Yeah.
00:44:00,00:44:03,"On one side, you've got lacrosse players coming, Sedan chers, or the other."
00:44:03,00:44:04,That's the type trouble.
00:44:04,00:44:09,"It was actually one team of five, and then another team of 99,995, and it was a draw."
00:44:09,00:44:11,It was a draw in the end.
00:44:11,00:44:12,Amazing.
00:44:12,00:44:13,That's mental.
00:44:13,00:44:14,Wow.
00:44:14,00:44:18,"But it was like it would be over vast distances, so Native Americans would be, you know, running"
00:44:18,00:44:23,"between states practically, and people subbing in and out quite a lot, I think, over many"
00:44:23,00:44:24,days.
00:44:24,00:44:27,It is the only sport that recognises Native Americans and First Nations people as their
00:44:27,00:44:33,"own individual nations, so they will, you know, in international games, you would enter as"
00:44:33,00:44:37,"an individual nation, like the Mohawk nation, and in fact, that caused a real problem."
00:44:37,00:44:43,"They travel on their own passports, so I think the Iroquois lacrosse team travels on Iroquois"
00:44:43,00:44:44,passports.
00:44:44,00:44:48,"Iroquois and Haudenosaunee, by the way, are sort of synonymous, except they call themselves"
00:44:48,00:44:49,Haudenosaunee.
00:44:49,00:44:51,"But, yeah, the passports tend to be recognised."
00:44:51,00:44:56,There was a bit of an issue in 2010 when Britain denied entry to the Iroquois team because
00:44:56,00:44:57,they didn't accept their passports.
00:44:57,00:45:01,"They wanted them to have US passports, and they said, ""Well, we don't consider ourselves"
00:45:01,00:45:02,"American."""
00:45:02,00:45:03,Right.
00:45:03,00:45:04,They didn't play.
00:45:04,00:45:05,"Lacrosse might come back, by the way, to the Olympics."
00:45:05,00:45:06,It is coming back.
00:45:06,00:45:07,"Yeah, because it's such a growing sport, isn't it?"
00:45:07,00:45:11,"So, 2018, they were given the status of receiving funds, which meant that they could sort of,"
00:45:11,00:45:13,"like, start showing that it was possible."
00:45:13,00:45:19,"And now an official, whatever the official sport that you need to be in order to get to"
00:45:19,00:45:20,"the Olympics, they are now that."
00:45:20,00:45:21,Yeah.
00:45:21,00:45:22,"So, they'll be there for the 2028."
00:45:22,00:45:23,"Yeah, hopefully."
00:45:23,00:45:24,Really?
00:45:24,00:45:25,Yeah.
00:45:25,00:45:29,"So, speaking of, this is just something I read today about hockey, so it must be the"
00:45:29,00:45:31,same with Lacrosse.
00:45:31,00:45:36,"And that is that if you're a sports person in Canada, you're doing your sport, you're"
00:45:36,00:45:40,"getting really sweaty, all your gear, your mitts, and your shirt and everything, your"
00:45:40,00:45:45,"underwear gets really, really smelly, but you can't put it outside to air, right, because"
00:45:45,00:45:46,it's so cold.
00:45:46,00:45:47,Okay.
00:45:47,00:45:52,"And so, traditionally, you find that these people have really, really smelly clothes and"
00:45:52,00:45:53,a kit and stuff like that.
00:45:53,00:45:57,"And so, they invented this thing, I can't remember what it's called, but it's like a"
00:45:57,00:46:03,"big sort of trunk, and you put your kit in, and it fires UV light into the trunk."
00:46:03,00:46:07,"And then that makes ozone, and the ozone kills all of the bacteria."
00:46:07,00:46:08,Wow.
00:46:08,00:46:11,"And when the bacteria is dyed, it means it can't make all the smells, and so, it kind"
00:46:11,00:46:13,of gets rid of all the smell of your kit.
00:46:13,00:46:15,And this is the amazing thing.
00:46:15,00:46:19,"What they hope in the future is, they might be able to scale this up to the size of a"
00:46:19,00:46:20,room.
00:46:20,00:46:23,"So, you would come in after your game of hockey or lacrosse or whatever, you'd hang"
00:46:23,00:46:27,"up your stuff, you'd go out of the room, close the door, and when the last person closed"
00:46:27,00:46:32,"the door, the whole place gets filled with UV light and ozone, and then when you come"
00:46:32,00:46:35,"back in, it's all clean and not salient, isn't that amazing?"
00:46:35,00:46:39,"So, might we have these instead of bathrooms in the future, instead of a shower?"
00:46:39,00:46:43,"Oh my, you know what I thought, because I read this article, and what I thought is,"
00:46:43,00:46:47,"it could be useful for putting your underwear in, right, you know, like if you have a linen"
00:46:47,00:46:51,"basket or something, get changed at night, take your underwear off, put it in the basket,"
00:46:51,00:46:54,"next morning, take it out again, it's fine."
00:46:54,00:46:55,Brilliant.
00:46:55,00:46:57,"You don't need clothes anymore, basically."
00:46:57,00:46:58,You don't need more than one of everything.
00:46:58,00:47:01,"Just one set of clothes for the rest of your life, and one set of night clothes if you"
00:47:01,00:47:02,wear them.
00:47:02,00:47:03,"Yeah, exactly."
00:47:03,00:47:06,"I mean, you can also put your clothes on a washing machine and a dryer."
00:47:06,00:47:07,"Yeah, but that's two things."
00:47:07,00:47:08,It's a combined system.
00:47:08,00:47:10,You can use loads of water.
00:47:10,00:47:13,"Can't do it at night, because it upsets your neighbors."
00:47:13,00:47:15,"I do it literally every night, oh my god."
00:47:15,00:47:16,What?
00:47:16,00:47:17,Put your washing machine on?
00:47:17,00:47:18,Oh my god.
00:47:18,00:47:19,Your psycho.
00:47:19,00:47:20,It's all right.
00:47:20,00:47:21,He lives in a cottage on the top of the mountain.
00:47:21,00:47:22,"In the moors, yeah."
00:47:22,00:47:28,"What you can also do is take your clothes to a tanning salon, presumably, and drop them"
00:47:28,00:47:30,"off, and ask them to book in a session."
00:47:30,00:47:31,Book a bed.
00:47:31,00:47:35,"Book a bed, and you come and you take all your clothes off, and they go, well, if you'd"
00:47:35,00:47:37,"like to get in, you say, no, no, here you go."
00:47:37,00:47:40,You've got to make sat in a chair naked next to it.
00:47:40,00:47:42,I'm going to climb into a washing machine now.
00:47:42,00:47:45,"You've got to make sure all of the employees know that that's happening, because they don't"
00:47:45,00:47:46,want to open a sunbed.
00:47:46,00:47:47,Just see the missing body.
00:47:47,00:47:48,Oh my god.
00:47:48,00:47:49,It happened again.
00:47:49,00:47:50,She's melted.
00:47:50,00:47:56,Can we talk about some extinct crafts?
00:47:56,00:47:57,Sure.
00:47:57,00:48:04,"So I spent quite a while on the Heritage Crafts website, Patron, Prince Charles, obviously."
00:48:04,00:48:06,So I thought I'd do a little quiz for you.
00:48:06,00:48:07,Okay.
00:48:07,00:48:08,Right.
00:48:08,00:48:12,"Is this craft endangered, critically endangered, currently viable, or extinct?"
00:48:12,00:48:13,Okay.
00:48:13,00:48:19,"But you sent us the link of this list, so we all have a bit of an advantage."
00:48:19,00:48:20,"We might still do badly, but- Absolutely."
00:48:20,00:48:21,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:48:21,00:48:23,I've got it literally open in front of you right now.
00:48:23,00:48:24,Shit.
00:48:24,00:48:25,Okay.
00:48:25,00:48:26,I'll close it.
00:48:26,00:48:27,I'll close it.
00:48:27,00:48:29,"I never bothered to read the sources you sent around, so I'm coming to this knife."
00:48:29,00:48:30,All right.
00:48:30,00:48:31,Orary making.
00:48:31,00:48:32,Orary.
00:48:32,00:48:33,Orary.
00:48:33,00:48:35,"So an orary is like the solar system, right?"
00:48:35,00:48:36,Exactly.
00:48:36,00:48:37,It's a model of the solar system.
00:48:37,00:48:38,"Oh, that's fine."
00:48:38,00:48:39,That's fine.
00:48:39,00:48:42,"Because, oh yeah, it's in every kid's toy shop, you've got to make them for kids."
00:48:42,00:48:44,"I'm with Dan, then."
00:48:44,00:48:45,He has inside a knowledge here.
00:48:45,00:48:46,Okay.
00:48:46,00:48:47,You're so viable.
00:48:47,00:48:48,"I'm saying, yeah."
00:48:48,00:48:49,Okay.
00:48:49,00:48:50,No probes.
00:48:50,00:48:51,Probably 200 of them.
00:48:51,00:48:52,Two in North London alone.
00:48:52,00:48:53,"There are 100,000 actually."
00:48:53,00:48:54,They all pale across.
00:48:54,00:48:59,"No, it's critically endangered as one full-time professional orary maker in the UK."
00:48:59,00:49:00,Really?
00:49:00,00:49:01,"Well, he's doing a damn good job."
00:49:01,00:49:02,"I won't just sing in toy shops, Dan."
00:49:02,00:49:05,I'm not sure I'm made by the real hand-made heritage.
00:49:05,00:49:06,"Mechanical, mechanical."
00:49:06,00:49:07,The craft.
00:49:07,00:49:08,Dice plastic ones.
00:49:08,00:49:12,"Mr. Fisher, he's the last one."
00:49:12,00:49:16,"Timothy Staines and his father, Derek, who was the previous full-timer, they make six"
00:49:16,00:49:17,to ten of these per year.
00:49:17,00:49:19,"Timothy Staines, by the way, is a sentence name."
00:49:19,00:49:22,"Oh, so it is."
00:49:22,00:49:24,"Welcome to the club, Timothy."
00:49:24,00:49:27,Rake making.
00:49:27,00:49:28,Is Oral Babes a sentence?
00:49:28,00:49:29,"No, it isn't."
00:49:29,00:49:30,Sorry.
00:49:30,00:49:31,No.
00:49:31,00:49:32,What were you saying?
00:49:32,00:49:33,Rake making.
00:49:33,00:49:34,Rake making.
00:49:34,00:49:35,"I think, yeah, everyone needs a rake, don't they, if you have a garden?"
00:49:35,00:49:39,"A garden implement, not a bit of a slimy, sleazy, loud-about clown."
00:49:39,00:49:40,"No, no."
00:49:40,00:49:41,Okay.
00:49:41,00:49:42,Then there's loads of them.
00:49:42,00:49:43,The least five.
00:49:43,00:49:44,It's endangered.
00:49:44,00:49:46,"Yeah, there are only about 5,000 made per year."
00:49:46,00:49:49,"There's specific kinds of rake, not just in all galleries."
00:49:49,00:49:50,One more.
00:49:50,00:49:51,Rocking horse manufacturer.
00:49:51,00:49:52,Viable.
00:49:52,00:49:53,Extinct.
00:49:53,00:49:54,Yeah.
00:49:54,00:49:55,Viable.
00:49:55,00:49:56,It's viable.
00:49:56,00:49:57,Okay.
00:49:57,00:50:00,"There is a guild of rocking horse makers, which has 2,000 members."
00:50:00,00:50:03,"The only qualification is you have to have made a rocking horse, which is fair enough,"
00:50:03,00:50:04,to be a member of the guild.
00:50:04,00:50:05,Yeah.
00:50:05,00:50:09,You don't have to have made it in the traditional age or sculpting.
00:50:09,00:50:12,I imagine there are some barriers to entry about what qualifies as a rocking horse.
00:50:12,00:50:15,"Of course, you can't just make any old shit and save some rocking horse and then claim"
00:50:15,00:50:16,your guild's membership.
00:50:16,00:50:17,"No, you have to."
00:50:17,00:50:18,Okay.
00:50:18,00:50:19,"Yeah, but I don't know exactly what the criteria are."
00:50:19,00:50:20,I'm going to test this.
00:50:20,00:50:21,Level of rock or whatever.
00:50:21,00:50:23,I read this incredible article.
00:50:23,00:50:24,Did any of you read it?
00:50:24,00:50:25,It's called Raiders of the Lost Crafts.
00:50:25,00:50:27,It was in The Independent in 2016.
00:50:27,00:50:28,No.
00:50:28,00:50:29,Raiders of the Lost Crafts.
00:50:29,00:50:31,It was written by a woman called Amalia Ildner.
00:50:31,00:50:36,"She talked about, so, pole leaf woodturning, which is when a crockery used to be wooden."
00:50:36,00:50:39,I didn't know you had wooden crockery.
00:50:39,00:50:43,"Most people would because it was just the most available substance, so back in Tudor"
00:50:43,00:50:44,"Times, for instance."
00:50:44,00:50:45,It's probably not...
00:50:45,00:50:46,"I thought crockery was like the noise it made, got that."
00:50:46,00:50:48,It's probably like blockery or something.
00:50:48,00:50:49,Blockery.
00:50:49,00:50:50,Yeah.
00:50:50,00:50:51,Yeah.
00:50:51,00:50:52,Woodery.
00:50:52,00:50:53,"I mean, blockery is a joke."
00:50:53,00:50:54,Woodery is just...
00:50:54,00:50:55,It's not...
00:50:55,00:51:01,I can't wait to hear Andy make that joke again in three weeks time.
00:51:01,00:51:02,I tell you what.
00:51:02,00:51:07,"When I tell it, you'll laugh."
00:51:07,00:51:10,"Okay, that's it."
00:51:10,00:51:11,That is all of our facts.
00:51:11,00:51:13,Thank you so much for listening.
00:51:13,00:51:16,If you'd like to get in contact with any of us about the things that we've said over
00:51:16,00:51:19,"the course of this podcast, we can all be found on our Twitter accounts."
00:51:19,00:51:21,I'm on @Sriberland.
