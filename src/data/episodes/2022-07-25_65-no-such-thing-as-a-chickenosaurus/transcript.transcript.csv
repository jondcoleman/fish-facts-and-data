00:00:00,00:00:04,This is how it works.
00:00:04,00:00:18,"Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast"
00:00:18,00:00:21,coming to you from the QI offices in Covent Garden.
00:00:21,00:00:22,My name is Dan Schreiber.
00:00:22,00:00:27,"I'm sitting here with Andy Murray, James Harkin, and Anna Chazinski, and once again we have"
00:00:27,00:00:31,"gathered around the microphone with our four favorite facts from the last seven days,"
00:00:31,00:00:35,"and in a particular order, here we go, starting with Andy."
00:00:35,00:00:39,My fact is that fish who work as cleaners can cheat their bosses and their bosses can
00:00:39,00:00:43,punish them.
00:00:43,00:00:45,So this is incredible.
00:00:45,00:00:49,"There are fish, as I'm sure you know, who clean other fish, as in they eat parasites"
00:00:49,00:00:50,from the skin.
00:00:50,00:00:54,So you get cleaner fish and client fish is what they're technically known as.
00:00:54,00:00:58,"And there have been lots of studies of this, especially by this amazing sounding ecologist"
00:00:58,00:01:03,"called Reduane Bacheri, I hope I'm pronouncing his name right, who has studied these guys"
00:01:03,00:01:04,so much.
00:01:04,00:01:09,"And basically, the trade is for food versus clean skin, but the cleaner fish they sometimes"
00:01:09,00:01:14,cheat because they actually like eating the thick mucus that covers the client fish as
00:01:14,00:01:19,"a protective layer, and they often have a cheeky bite of it instead of eating a parasite."
00:01:19,00:01:22,"And that makes the client fish jump, I guess, in pain."
00:01:22,00:01:25,"So that's them cheating it and then their bosses, the client fish punish them by chasing"
00:01:25,00:01:27,them around.
00:01:27,00:01:32,"And the cleaner fish which have been chased around, they behave better in future."
00:01:32,00:01:35,They stop misbehaving as much when they've been chased about.
00:01:35,00:01:36,What are they threatening to do when they chase them around?
00:01:36,00:01:41,"Because in the end, they want to be making contact with, it's like being chased around"
00:01:41,00:01:42,by someone you really fancy.
00:01:42,00:01:50,"It's like being chased by your boss, you know, because they're often bigger fish or"
00:01:50,00:01:51,they're often predatory.
00:01:51,00:01:54,Being chased by your boss.
00:01:54,00:01:58,Secretive QI experts.
00:01:58,00:02:01,"So yeah, if there are lots of client fish, then the cleaners have the upper hand because"
00:02:01,00:02:02,they're more in demand.
00:02:02,00:02:06,And so they try and take more bites of mucus because they know that they've got a captive
00:02:06,00:02:07,market.
00:02:07,00:02:08,Right?
00:02:08,00:02:09,Yeah.
00:02:09,00:02:10,Because the client fish have to get clean somewhere.
00:02:10,00:02:11,Yeah.
00:02:11,00:02:12,Genius.
00:02:12,00:02:14,"So they propagate the problem in order that they can solve it, which is kind of exactly"
00:02:14,00:02:17,"what a lot of human industry does, right?"
00:02:17,00:02:20,"I guess so, yeah, how do they propagate the problem?"
00:02:20,00:02:22,Are they making it worse?
00:02:22,00:02:24,They're tricking the...
00:02:24,00:02:25,Not really.
00:02:25,00:02:27,"No, because they're not luring the number of client fish available."
00:02:27,00:02:28,Okay.
00:02:28,00:02:29,You know what I mean?
00:02:29,00:02:30,But client fish...
00:02:30,00:02:33,"No, actually, they're sort of up because client fish remove their customer if they get"
00:02:33,00:02:36,bad service.
00:02:36,00:02:40,And they kind of keep going back to the same species or the same fish that they really
00:02:40,00:02:42,"like and have good service from, don't they?"
00:02:42,00:02:43,Yeah.
00:02:43,00:02:44,Really?
00:02:44,00:02:45,Yeah.
00:02:45,00:02:46,"Okay, that's really cool."
00:02:46,00:02:49,"Huge service stations, so there are hundreds of them or something."
00:02:49,00:02:50,"Yeah, they have..."
00:02:50,00:02:53,"They're all over the ocean, especially on reefs, that's whether you get them."
00:02:53,00:02:54,There are these...
00:02:54,00:02:56,"Just a big welcome break of cleaners, yeah."
00:02:56,00:02:57,Basically...
00:02:57,00:02:58,A big shell.
00:02:58,00:02:59,Yeah.
00:02:59,00:03:00,(laughter)
00:03:00,00:03:01,Cool.
00:03:01,00:03:06,"Yeah, a single cleaner fish inspects more than two hundred two thousand three hundred"
00:03:06,00:03:07,fish a day.
00:03:07,00:03:08,Wow.
00:03:08,00:03:10,And it eats about twelve hundred parasites.
00:03:10,00:03:12,That's an impressive rate of work.
00:03:12,00:03:17,And some client fish had themselves cleaned every five minutes.
00:03:17,00:03:18,So vain.
00:03:18,00:03:19,Celebrity client fish.
00:03:19,00:03:20,Yeah.
00:03:20,00:03:22,"So this isn't quite a recent discovery, right?"
00:03:22,00:03:23,"Yeah, yeah."
00:03:23,00:03:24,This is a scuba diver who is...
00:03:24,00:03:25,Yeah.
00:03:25,00:03:30,"Which is really cool because it just makes me wonder, what are the mysteries of fish, you"
00:03:30,00:03:31,know?
00:03:31,00:03:32,There's so many things that we don't...
00:03:32,00:03:33,"Like, I was reading as well."
00:03:33,00:03:34,There's a...
00:03:34,00:03:37,"I can't remember what the fish is called now, but it's a fish that basically sun bathes."
00:03:37,00:03:40,It goes to the surface of the water and it just lays it for half the day.
00:03:40,00:03:44,They've had no idea why it does that until recently they just put a camera on it and worked
00:03:44,00:03:46,out that it was going really deep and it was...
00:03:46,00:03:50,And it was finding all these other little things to eat and the coldness meant that it needed
00:03:50,00:03:54,"to get up there to get the heat back down, like just to regulate their body temperature."
00:03:54,00:03:55,Yeah.
00:03:55,00:03:56,But they didn't know that up until recently.
00:03:56,00:04:00,So we've just had floating sunbathing fish up until a year or so ago.
00:04:00,00:04:03,"Well, so they're just warming themselves up so that they can conserve heat to go back down"
00:04:03,00:04:04,to the cold water.
00:04:04,00:04:06,I think they're called sunfish.
00:04:06,00:04:07,"Yes, sunfish."
00:04:07,00:04:10,It's a cool thing. They get cleaned themselves by albatrosses.
00:04:10,00:04:11,No!
00:04:11,00:04:12,No!
00:04:12,00:04:13,That doesn't sound like cleaning.
00:04:13,00:04:15,That sounds like the albatross is trying to eat them.
00:04:15,00:04:16,No!
00:04:16,00:04:17,It doesn't quite get to go.
00:04:17,00:04:18,"No, because they're huge."
00:04:18,00:04:22,"It's what the biggest ever found weighed 2.3 Tarras, they're massive."
00:04:22,00:04:23,"Oh, yeah, they're massive."
00:04:23,00:04:26,"And when they get infested with these parasites, which obviously they suck their blood and"
00:04:26,00:04:30,"they're horrible, albatrosses land nearby as they sunbathe and pick the parasites off"
00:04:30,00:04:31,them.
00:04:31,00:04:32,Wow.
00:04:32,00:04:33,Isn't that incredible?
00:04:33,00:04:34,"Yeah, that's pretty cool."
00:04:34,00:04:38,"It's kind of for some reason, it reminds me of humpback whales, get parasites on them."
00:04:38,00:04:39,Don't they?
00:04:39,00:04:40,They get lice on them.
00:04:40,00:04:44,And that's when you see a whale breaching and then like jumping out of the water and then
00:04:44,00:04:47,"splashing back down again, it's often trying to dislodge the parasites."
00:04:47,00:04:51,Is that the equivalent of a dog dragging itself along the ground?
00:04:51,00:04:55,"But it's slightly more romantic than that, yeah."
00:04:55,00:05:00,Because you don't get couples going on special holidays to watch dogs dragging themselves
00:05:00,00:05:02,along the ground.
00:05:02,00:05:05,I don't know if I've seen that.
00:05:05,00:05:08,Do you have a sick dog?
00:05:08,00:05:19,"No, I've never seen it in real life, but I've seen it in cartoons and stuff."
00:05:19,00:05:21,I've seen it in cartoons and stuff.
00:05:21,00:05:25,"Tom and Jerry's changed, isn't it?"
00:05:25,00:05:30,"So this is another parasite, so Oxpeckas have a similar relationship to things like rhinos"
00:05:30,00:05:31,and buffaloes.
00:05:31,00:05:32,What's Oxpeckas?
00:05:32,00:05:33,It's a kind of bird.
00:05:33,00:05:34,So an Oxpeck.
00:05:34,00:05:35,Oxes.
00:05:35,00:05:36,It sure does.
00:05:36,00:05:37,Ah.
00:05:37,00:05:40,It packs Oxen and Zebra's and rhinos.
00:05:40,00:05:42,It's a fitting name.
00:05:42,00:05:45,And so it sits on them and it eats ticks and parasites that live on them.
00:05:45,00:05:50,"But they also trick their hosts because they obviously, they've got a vested interest in"
00:05:50,00:05:53,"getting more ticks and parasites to come and, you know, land on these animals."
00:05:53,00:05:57,"And so they exacerbate their wounds or if they've got a bit of blood, bloodied wound"
00:05:57,00:06:00,"exposed, then the Oxpeckas will come and peck it, make it a bit worse."
00:06:00,00:06:04,To make sure that more parasites come and then they can eat the parasites.
00:06:04,00:06:05,Really?
00:06:05,00:06:10,It's like a cleaner who makes your house more dirty.
00:06:10,00:06:12,Just so more cleaners come.
00:06:12,00:06:14,I think I'm going to need to hire another cleaner.
00:06:14,00:06:15,Fuck you.
00:06:15,00:06:17,You've just got hundreds of cleaners here.
00:06:17,00:06:20,"I'm a dirty, dirty, dirty house."
00:06:20,00:06:21,Yeah.
00:06:21,00:06:25,"So there is, there are really cool photos on the mail of, there's a 13-year-old who went"
00:06:25,00:06:28,snorkeling in Indonesia and he persuaded a shrimp to clean his teeth.
00:06:28,00:06:29,Wow.
00:06:29,00:06:30,Yeah.
00:06:30,00:06:31,He saved persuades.
00:06:31,00:06:32,Come on.
00:06:32,00:06:33,Yeah.
00:06:33,00:06:34,Come on.
00:06:34,00:06:35,I'm not going to tell anyone.
00:06:35,00:06:36,He's probably going to enjoy it.
00:06:36,00:06:38,"He snorkeled down to whether it, because he's, he found a cleaning station."
00:06:38,00:06:42,"One of these garages, basically, where they, they, and they, they, there it's not fish."
00:06:42,00:06:43,It's shrimp.
00:06:43,00:06:45,It just happens to be owned and operated by shrimp.
00:06:45,00:06:49,"And, um, he opened his mouth and it went into his mouth and it removed bits of food from"
00:06:49,00:06:50,between his teeth.
00:06:50,00:06:51,Wow.
00:06:51,00:06:52,"Yeah, I've seen that."
00:06:52,00:06:53,It's pretty gross.
00:06:53,00:06:54,Unbelievable.
00:06:54,00:06:55,Cool.
00:06:55,00:06:56,I'll put up pictures of it on Twitter.
00:06:56,00:06:57,"If you've just been eating shrimp, though, that wouldn't be very nice."
00:06:57,00:06:58,Oh my god.
00:06:58,00:06:59,That's true.
00:06:59,00:07:00,That's a good boy.
00:07:00,00:07:01,Jeff?
00:07:01,00:07:02,Okay.
00:07:02,00:07:05,That's like having a car made of mechanics.
00:07:05,00:07:13,"Um, quite an expensive dental treatment, I think, flying to Bali every time you clean your"
00:07:13,00:07:14,teeth.
00:07:14,00:07:15,A toothpick.
00:07:15,00:07:16,We'll do the job.
00:07:16,00:07:19,"Um, but they're, they're also, they're a mimic fish."
00:07:19,00:07:22,"So clean a fish have a bright blue stripe along them often or really, they're really brightly"
00:07:22,00:07:25,"coming to, kind of, to advertise themselves and say, hey, look, I'm here on bright and"
00:07:25,00:07:26,"I'm, I'm happy to clean your teeth."
00:07:26,00:07:28,"Um, or eat the parasites or whatever."
00:07:28,00:07:32,"But they're a mimic fish, which have evolved the same kind of stripe, hang around near"
00:07:32,00:07:36,cleaner fish and just go around taking chunks out of just eating the mucus only.
00:07:36,00:07:37,"Yeah, eating the mucus only."
00:07:37,00:07:38,Exactly.
00:07:38,00:07:42,"And that, that damage is trade because it makes fish at the station more nervy."
00:07:42,00:07:46,"And these stations, they're like, um, um, what's a good, they're like neutral territory"
00:07:46,00:07:47,in the ocean.
00:07:47,00:07:51,So you get even sharks turning up to have the parasites cleaned up and they don't eat fish
00:07:51,00:07:56,"that they would normally be hunting and killing and eating because it's kind of safe,"
00:07:56,00:07:58,it's a safe zone for all fish.
00:07:58,00:07:59,Okay.
00:07:59,00:08:04,"So if you fall out of the boat in the middle of the ocean, what you need to do is find one"
00:08:04,00:08:08,"of these areas and then no sharks will eat you because you're safe and then you're, you're"
00:08:08,00:08:09,in the neutral zone.
00:08:09,00:08:10,Exactly.
00:08:10,00:08:11,Yeah.
00:08:11,00:08:12,And you get a good floss.
00:08:12,00:08:13,Mine is out there.
00:08:13,00:08:20,"Um, my favourite mutualism, like mutualistic relationship underwater is actually shrimp based."
00:08:20,00:08:25,"It's, uh, the relationship between shrimps and goby fish who's in this, so shrimps and goby"
00:08:25,00:08:29,"fish have this really sweet relationship where the goby fish gets the shrimp to build its,"
00:08:29,00:08:33,"so the goby fish lives in, um, little dugouts in the sand at the bottom of the ocean."
00:08:33,00:08:36,"And it gets, employs the shrimp to build its little dugout."
00:08:36,00:08:41,"Um, and then it keeps the shrimp on as a permanent cleaner to clean its house."
00:08:41,00:08:45,"So they've lived together in this house and the goby shrimp is employing, the goby fish"
00:08:45,00:08:48,is employing the shrimp to clean his house and to build it.
00:08:48,00:08:49,But what are you paying for?
00:08:49,00:08:53,"And in exchange, the, because the shrimp doesn't have very good eyesight, so can't really"
00:08:53,00:08:57,"spot when predators are coming, so the goby fish sits at the top of the borough and looks"
00:08:57,00:09:01,"out for predators and they're always in contact, so the goby fish always has a little fin touching"
00:09:01,00:09:02,the shrimp.
00:09:02,00:09:05,"And if there's a predator who, like, wave his fin at the shrimp, it'll be like, go back in"
00:09:05,00:09:06,the hole.
00:09:06,00:09:08,"Sounds like a great sitcom, doesn't it?"
00:09:08,00:09:09,Yeah.
00:09:09,00:09:14,"But also, the, the other shark or fish, whatever, must know that the goby is hiding, you're going"
00:09:14,00:09:15,to shrimp at home today?
00:09:15,00:09:16,"Oh, no."
00:09:16,00:09:17,"No, tired him."
00:09:17,00:09:18,"He was, he wasn't doing a good job, but..."
00:09:18,00:09:21,Was that what you hold it on to down there?
00:09:21,00:09:22,I don't know.
00:09:22,00:09:24,"So, me or Finn, the other one."
00:09:24,00:09:25,Yeah.
00:09:25,00:09:32,"So, some of these cleaner fish, if they eat too much, if you're a female cleaner fish, if"
00:09:32,00:09:35,"you eat too much, you turn into a male, so you get bigger and bigger and you turn into"
00:09:35,00:09:36,a male.
00:09:36,00:09:37,Right?
00:09:37,00:09:40,"It's, I don't quite know how that works, but it does work."
00:09:40,00:09:45,And apparently there's some very new research that says that male cleaner fish will aggressively
00:09:45,00:09:48,nudge their mates to watch their diet.
00:09:48,00:09:54,"So, if they're eating too much, because I like, stop it, you'll turn into a male."
00:09:54,00:09:58,That is so good.
00:09:58,00:10:01,"Okay, time for fact number two."
00:10:01,00:10:06,My fact this week is that al-Qaeda's job application form includes a question asking who
00:10:06,00:10:10,should be contacted in the event that the applicant becomes a martyr.
00:10:10,00:10:14,"Now, I have a lot of questions about that."
00:10:14,00:10:15,Yeah.
00:10:15,00:10:16,"There's, where is the job application form available?"
00:10:16,00:10:21,"Okay, so they found this as a part of, basically, when they raided Bin Laden's house and when"
00:10:21,00:10:24,"Bin Laden was taken down, they took all the stuff from his house."
00:10:24,00:10:29,"He was applying for a job, so now all you have to do is go to Bin Laden's house and then"
00:10:29,00:10:30,pick up a form there.
00:10:30,00:10:31,It's very easy.
00:10:31,00:10:36,"But so they, they found a lot of books, they found a lot of papers, obviously, and the government"
00:10:36,00:10:40,"hadn't released it for a long time, and it's just been released, and part of the papers"
00:10:40,00:10:43,that were found in his house was the al-Qaeda job applicant form.
00:10:43,00:10:46,"There are lots of questions like, what objectives would you like to accomplish on"
00:10:46,00:10:47,your G-head path?
00:10:47,00:10:56,"I guess they don't ask, where will you be in the next five years?"
00:10:56,00:10:58,"And hobbies, they want to know hobbies?"
00:10:58,00:10:59,Really?
00:10:59,00:11:00,Yeah.
00:11:00,00:11:01,Hobbies and pastimes is another question.
00:11:01,00:11:03,Do you know that Bin Laden was a really good volleyball player?
00:11:03,00:11:04,"No, do."
00:11:04,00:11:05,Is he?
00:11:05,00:11:06,"Yeah, he was."
00:11:06,00:11:11,"Whenever they used to have volleyball competitions in al-Qaeda, he and Mohammed Atef had to"
00:11:11,00:11:15,be on different teams because they were both by far the best players.
00:11:15,00:11:16,Wow.
00:11:16,00:11:17,"He taught, wasn't he?"
00:11:17,00:11:18,"Yeah, he was."
00:11:18,00:11:21,But was he really good in the way that we've often said Kim Jong-un is great at golf?
00:11:21,00:11:25,"You know, like, were people just letting him win every shot, kind of thing?"
00:11:25,00:11:26,Maybe.
00:11:26,00:11:27,I wanted to.
00:11:27,00:11:28,I thought he was on dialysis.
00:11:28,00:11:31,This might have been earlier before the dialysis.
00:11:31,00:11:32,Okay.
00:11:32,00:11:34,Because a lot of the best volleyball players are not on dialysis.
00:11:34,00:11:35,It's true.
00:11:35,00:11:36,That's a good fact.
00:11:36,00:11:40,It's possibly Nintendo Wii that he was on volleyball on as well.
00:11:40,00:11:42,I suppose if you have to stay indoors all the time.
00:11:42,00:11:43,Exactly.
00:11:43,00:11:47,"Well, was he found with some kind of games console or no, he had loads of DVDs."
00:11:47,00:11:48,Lots of DVDs.
00:11:48,00:11:49,Lots of pornography.
00:11:49,00:11:50,Lots of pornography.
00:11:50,00:11:51,No.
00:11:51,00:11:52,"Yeah, they've not released the titles."
00:11:52,00:11:53,But they said that had he had a big.
00:11:53,00:11:54,Yeah.
00:11:54,00:11:55,"No, I don't know what."
00:11:55,00:11:56,Tell me.
00:11:56,00:11:57,"Yeah, yeah."
00:11:57,00:11:59,Because they've said that he had a lot of books and they released the titles of the books
00:11:59,00:12:03,"that he had, which included known Chomsky books and really oddly conspiracy theory books"
00:12:03,00:12:05,"about 9/11, which is really interesting."
00:12:05,00:12:06,"Oh, really?"
00:12:06,00:12:07,"Yeah, yeah."
00:12:07,00:12:08,He had a lot of them.
00:12:08,00:12:09,And a huge stash of pornography.
00:12:09,00:12:11,They've not told us what they are.
00:12:11,00:12:17,One thing that said though is that apparently extremists often have pornography as a way
00:12:17,00:12:18,of communicating.
00:12:18,00:12:19,So they'll have coded messages within a--
00:12:19,00:12:20,"Oh, yeah, that is true."
00:12:20,00:12:21,Yeah.
00:12:21,00:12:27,"Stagnography, it's called, which is when you put messages in pictures and terrorists usually"
00:12:27,00:12:28,use pornography.
00:12:28,00:12:34,"Well, so they set up a porn shoot in order that they can plant a message into the scene somewhere."
00:12:34,00:12:37,I think they use existing photos.
00:12:37,00:12:45,That is the most convoluted excuse for seeing naked women-- I'm looking for a message.
00:12:45,00:12:47,"To look really closely at this one, I'm afraid."
00:12:47,00:12:48,Probably for hours.
00:12:48,00:12:53,"I'm probably going to take it with me, actually, guys."
00:12:53,00:12:57,"I'd like to thank you for this fact, Dan, because now in the course of researching application"
00:12:57,00:13:05,"forms for terrorism, I have, in my Google record, the phrase ""apply to join ISIS."""
00:13:05,00:13:11,"And as I speak on the UN terror watch list, you probably are."
00:13:11,00:13:12,That's a way to think that--
00:13:12,00:13:13,Yeah.
00:13:13,00:13:14,We'll have alerted some time and some time.
00:13:14,00:13:17,"I've been in it five minutes ago, and now that's never leaving me."
00:13:17,00:13:21,"Isn't there a, like, a removals company in the UK called ISIS, or used to be called"
00:13:21,00:13:22,ISIS?
00:13:22,00:13:23,And then they had to change their name.
00:13:23,00:13:24,Or is a building company awesome?
00:13:24,00:13:26,"There are lots of-- there are lots of firms, actually."
00:13:26,00:13:30,"So there's-- and someers, they were bringing out a line called ISIS."
00:13:30,00:13:32,I think we've mentioned this on the podcast before.
00:13:32,00:13:36,"And they said, well, it's too late to change it now."
00:13:36,00:13:39,We've been working on this for six months.
00:13:39,00:13:44,The best one was about that is the people who had a 21st birthday party.
00:13:44,00:13:45,Do you remember that?
00:13:45,00:13:46,No.
00:13:46,00:13:47,So it's a 21st birthday party.
00:13:47,00:13:50,They had two balloons that said 21st or 2 in a 1.
00:13:50,00:13:53,"But from the other side of the room, it looked like ISIS."
00:13:53,00:13:55,"So from outside, it looked like ISIS."
00:13:55,00:13:58,"And people called the police and said, we think there's a--"
00:13:58,00:13:59,"You know, I know."
00:13:59,00:14:00,"Like, as if they--"
00:14:00,00:14:01,That's birthday party.
00:14:01,00:14:03,"That is, if they'd advertise where they were with--"
00:14:03,00:14:05,I don't know if they have ISIS balloons.
00:14:05,00:14:08,They don't seem like the kind of party balloon sort of guys.
00:14:08,00:14:10,I was an Oxford a few weeks ago.
00:14:10,00:14:13,And there was an NHS sort of small building that
00:14:13,00:14:16,was called ISIS out on the front of it as well.
00:14:16,00:14:18,"And right next to the sign ISIS, there was another sign"
00:14:18,00:14:21,"that they put outside in paper that said, please do not"
00:14:21,00:14:23,lean your bicycle against our wall.
00:14:23,00:14:26,"And you're like, I am definitely not going to lean on it."
00:14:26,00:14:28,No bicycles on that wall.
00:14:28,00:14:30,It's fantastic.
00:14:30,00:14:33,You know the question that you get asked on forms
00:14:33,00:14:34,so the US visa form.
00:14:34,00:14:36,"I mean, there's some very, very way questions."
00:14:36,00:14:40,"Like, are you coming to the US to engage in prostitution?"
00:14:40,00:14:42,Do you belong to a clan or tribe?
00:14:42,00:14:45,"And have you ever been responsible for quotes, particularly"
00:14:45,00:14:48,severe violations of religious freedom?
00:14:48,00:14:52,So presumably trivial violations of religious freedom
00:14:52,00:14:53,are OK.
00:14:53,00:14:54,But do you know the reason they do this?
00:14:54,00:14:56,"No, you have to answer all these."
00:14:56,00:15:00,"Is it because then if you answer it and you lie,"
00:15:00,00:15:02,then they can kick you out because you've lie done a fart.
00:15:02,00:15:03,Yes.
00:15:03,00:15:06,So that they have a reason to say you've
00:15:06,00:15:08,obtained a visa by fraud or misrepresentation.
00:15:08,00:15:10,And that in itself is enough of a reason
00:15:10,00:15:11,to ask you to leave the country.
00:15:11,00:15:12,So that's why they do it.
00:15:12,00:15:14,Did you see the Mexican visa application one?
00:15:14,00:15:15,"No, no."
00:15:15,00:15:16,So this is one of the questions on it.
00:15:16,00:15:20,"Since been taken off, describe your mustache slash beard."
00:15:20,00:15:25,That can not be true.
00:15:25,00:15:26,That's the number of people are written.
00:15:26,00:15:29,This was in either the independent or the telegraph.
00:15:29,00:15:32,They did a survey of questions you've
00:15:32,00:15:33,been asked on a visa form.
00:15:33,00:15:35,Did you check the data on that?
00:15:35,00:15:37,Because that does sound very--
00:15:37,00:15:38,I was suspect it was one respondent.
00:15:38,00:15:41,"And he said the options were scant, bushy, or clipped."
00:15:41,00:15:47,"I have to say, I wasn't going to read this out either."
00:15:47,00:15:50,It's too much of a risk.
00:15:50,00:15:51,"Hey, one guy claimed it."
00:15:51,00:15:52,I believe it.
00:15:52,00:15:55,"Did you see that job application in The Alps of Silly,"
00:15:55,00:15:58,which was for an air traffic controller?
00:15:58,00:16:00,And it was in Braille.
00:16:00,00:16:01,"Oh, really?"
00:16:01,00:16:02,Yeah.
00:16:02,00:16:04,"And they were like, well, all of our job applications"
00:16:04,00:16:08,"have to come in all the different in Braille, as well as in--"
00:16:08,00:16:08,"Yeah, yeah."
00:16:08,00:16:09,"I'm writing, so."
00:16:09,00:16:10,Scary stuff.
00:16:10,00:16:11,"That was it, isn't it?"
00:16:11,00:16:12,Yeah.
00:16:12,00:16:14,"In Russia, to get your dry cleaning done,"
00:16:14,00:16:18,"you have to sign your signature five times,"
00:16:18,00:16:20,and feel it in a larger number of forms.
00:16:20,00:16:22,There's a really good essay on the Guardian website
00:16:22,00:16:24,about Bureaucracy in Russia.
00:16:24,00:16:30,And how lots of Soviet Bureaucracy has basically survived.
00:16:30,00:16:30,OK.
00:16:30,00:16:34,That doesn't sound like it would be true in all dry cleaners.
00:16:34,00:16:37,"Maybe it isn't, especially bureaucratic dry cleaning."
00:16:37,00:16:38,Is it just one form?
00:16:38,00:16:41,And there's five signature lines at the bottom.
00:16:41,00:16:43,"Sounds like dry cleaners is a euphemism for something,"
00:16:43,00:16:47,like cleaning the streets of London of bit treacherous.
00:16:47,00:16:51,"I was at a hotel once, and the person reception asked me"
00:16:51,00:16:54,"for my two signatures, and I said, I've only got one."
00:16:54,00:16:57,And I think it's the funniest thing I've ever said in my life.
00:16:57,00:16:58,She didn't even--
00:16:58,00:16:59,I've heard that if you're funny yet.
00:16:59,00:17:11,"OK, time for fact number three, and that is James."
00:17:11,00:17:15,"OK, my fact this week is that the single biggest expense"
00:17:15,00:17:18,in the computer game LEGO Universe
00:17:18,00:17:20,was to hire human moderators to make sure
00:17:20,00:17:25,that people weren't making LEGO penises.
00:17:25,00:17:27,So penis monitoring?
00:17:27,00:17:28,"What it was, it's one of those games, like Minecraft,"
00:17:28,00:17:30,where you can build things and whatever.
00:17:30,00:17:33,"And a lot of people, of course, when you can build anything"
00:17:33,00:17:34,"you want, if you can draw anything you want,"
00:17:34,00:17:36,a lot of people draw penises.
00:17:36,00:17:38,And they wanted to come up with a way
00:17:38,00:17:40,"of stopping people from doing this,"
00:17:40,00:17:42,because they wanted other people to go into your world.
00:17:42,00:17:45,And they didn't want children stumbling
00:17:45,00:17:47,into the world of someone who built a penis.
00:17:47,00:17:49,And so they tried to get a computer
00:17:49,00:17:52,"to be able to work out when the repinises around,"
00:17:52,00:17:54,but the computer couldn't do it.
00:17:54,00:17:56,They just-- it was impossible to come up
00:17:56,00:17:58,with a program that would definitely recognize
00:17:58,00:18:01,a LEGO penis above anything else.
00:18:01,00:18:03,"Like sometimes they'd say something was a penis,"
00:18:03,00:18:05,"and actually it was a building, and sometimes they"
00:18:05,00:18:06,would miss one or whatever.
00:18:06,00:18:08,And so the only way to get around it
00:18:08,00:18:11,was to get a moderation team who would check every single
00:18:11,00:18:15,erection to check that it wasn't a penis.
00:18:15,00:18:16,Oh my god.
00:18:16,00:18:18,"And it cost them a fortune, and that was probably"
00:18:18,00:18:20,why it went off.
00:18:20,00:18:22,"And this was tweeted by a lady called Megan Fox,"
00:18:22,00:18:24,"who was a developer who worked on the projects,"
00:18:24,00:18:27,"and it was picked up by a website called Fusion.net,"
00:18:27,00:18:29,who wrote an article about it last week.
00:18:29,00:18:32,"See, I didn't know that Megan Fox had been branching out."
00:18:32,00:18:33,Yeah.
00:18:33,00:18:34,Good work.
00:18:34,00:18:35,"You can-- just for the sake of it,"
00:18:35,00:18:38,"you can actually reach her on glass, bottom Meg."
00:18:38,00:18:39,That's her actual Twitter handle.
00:18:39,00:18:41,So if anyone has any questions following this podcast--
00:18:41,00:18:43,"Yeah, don't ask me."
00:18:43,00:18:44,Go straight to Megan.
00:18:44,00:18:45,Wow.
00:18:45,00:18:47,Penises stop the LEGO universe game.
00:18:47,00:18:48,That's such a shame.
00:18:48,00:18:50,It's such a victory for--
00:18:50,00:18:50,Willie.
00:18:50,00:18:53,It's not a victory for innocence and joyfulness and play.
00:18:53,00:18:54,Yeah.
00:18:54,00:18:56,It's a victory for people building enormous penises.
00:18:56,00:18:57,Yeah.
00:18:57,00:18:58,"But can't they, like on most websites,"
00:18:58,00:19:00,you have the ability to have a parent lock.
00:19:00,00:19:02,Can they just do a kind of parent lock?
00:19:02,00:19:04,And stop children from playing the LEGO computer game.
00:19:04,00:19:06,"Maybe-- no, no, no, no, maybe if you--"
00:19:06,00:19:07,Warning.
00:19:07,00:19:07,It splits a penis.
00:19:07,00:19:08,It's a penis only.
00:19:08,00:19:11,Maybe it's an adult if you register your penis in it.
00:19:11,00:19:16,"Like you say, I have built a penis in my universe."
00:19:16,00:19:18,"And they go, penis is something you have to do"
00:19:18,00:19:22,when you've done something much worse than a LEGO game.
00:19:22,00:19:24,"Well, the point is it's people--"
00:19:24,00:19:26,they're not worried about the people who
00:19:26,00:19:27,are going to register it.
00:19:27,00:19:30,It's the people who nefariously build these penises.
00:19:30,00:19:32,And they can you just stop them.
00:19:32,00:19:33,Because penises look a lot like other stuff.
00:19:33,00:19:35,"Yeah, they look like buildings."
00:19:35,00:19:36,Snails.
00:19:36,00:19:38,[LAUGHTER]
00:19:38,00:19:40,Other penises.
00:19:40,00:19:42,Other penises.
00:19:42,00:19:43,Should we ban this?
00:19:43,00:19:44,It could be a penis.
00:19:44,00:19:46,"But also, it could just be another penis."
00:19:46,00:19:47,In which case?
00:19:47,00:19:48,We should leave it.
00:19:48,00:19:51,I was reading today just on LEGO.
00:19:51,00:19:55,That Cambridge is thinking of creating a new post
00:19:55,00:19:58,"for a professor, the professor of LEGO."
00:19:58,00:19:59,"Not just thinking, I think they are doing it."
00:19:59,00:20:00,Yeah.
00:20:00,00:20:01,So you're going to be made of LEGO.
00:20:01,00:20:04,With loads of LEGO undergraduates as well.
00:20:04,00:20:05,[LAUGHTER]
00:20:05,00:20:05,That'd be really cool.
00:20:05,00:20:09,"They basically, LEGO provided them, supposedly,"
00:20:09,00:20:12,with 2.5 mil to create the post.
00:20:12,00:20:14,And it's going to be about play in education and stuff
00:20:14,00:20:14,like that.
00:20:14,00:20:16,"Yeah, there might be a professor of LEGO now."
00:20:16,00:20:19,"OK, so things that computers can't do, maybe."
00:20:19,00:20:21,So the US is spending a lot of money
00:20:21,00:20:25,to try and get facial recognition on people
00:20:25,00:20:27,when they're going through airports
00:20:27,00:20:29,to kind of see if they look like a terrorist.
00:20:29,00:20:32,"And supposedly, there might be some little micro expressions"
00:20:32,00:20:34,"that people give off, like, if they're"
00:20:34,00:20:38,worried by the fact that they have to go through security.
00:20:38,00:20:39,"But apparently, the face of a man"
00:20:39,00:20:42,about a detonator suicide belt has the same expression
00:20:42,00:20:45,as a man who realises he has left the stovon.
00:20:45,00:20:46,[LAUGHTER]
00:20:46,00:20:47,"Oh, wow."
00:20:47,00:20:48,That's why they can't tell.
00:20:48,00:20:50,"No, and I left the suicide belt in the stov."
00:20:50,00:20:53,"Oh, this is a disaster."
00:20:53,00:20:55,It's not a-- because that's what the human face is.
00:20:55,00:20:59,There's not a specific expression for a specific situation.
00:20:59,00:20:59,It's an emotion.
00:20:59,00:21:01,[LAUGHTER]
00:21:01,00:21:02,So there we go.
00:21:02,00:21:05,Did you see that Play Do a couple of years ago
00:21:05,00:21:07,had to withdraw this--
00:21:07,00:21:09,had to withdraw this product that it was releasing
00:21:09,00:21:12,called the icing extruder after--
00:21:12,00:21:13,"Oh, god."
00:21:13,00:21:15,--the complaints from parents that look like a penis.
00:21:15,00:21:18,And it was extruding icing as well.
00:21:18,00:21:19,It was extruding icing.
00:21:19,00:21:20,It was to help them make cakes.
00:21:20,00:21:22,So I think it was like a shaping tool.
00:21:22,00:21:25,"But if you look at it, it is a penis and testicles."
00:21:25,00:21:28,"And yeah, I think these reports said, unfortunately,"
00:21:28,00:21:31,"it looks more like a sex toy, albeit a three-incher,"
00:21:31,00:21:33,"than a child's toy, which is true."
00:21:33,00:21:37,"I think that's, surely, that's all in the mind of the parents"
00:21:37,00:21:38,who are dating them.
00:21:38,00:21:42,And he's just showing us the Play Do picture on his computer now.
00:21:42,00:21:43,"Oh, no."
00:21:43,00:21:43,"Oh, yeah, so it is."
00:21:43,00:21:46,I'm amazed that Safe Search is letting it through to be honest.
00:21:46,00:21:47,But that's fine.
00:21:47,00:21:48,When you see it actually--
00:21:48,00:21:49,--lock on your own laptop.
00:21:49,00:21:51,Of course.
00:21:51,00:21:53,"Every day, Andy's mom gives him his backlogs."
00:21:53,00:21:57,But it's the parent lock on his computer sent him off to work.
00:21:57,00:22:02,Have you heard about the oldest penis ever discovered?
00:22:02,00:22:03,It's not micro-brucky or sticky.
00:22:03,00:22:04,"Yes, sorry."
00:22:04,00:22:06,"That is the very, very oldest penis."
00:22:06,00:22:09,This is the oldest man-made representation of a penis.
00:22:09,00:22:11,"Oh, OK, which is a physical object, not just a drawing."
00:22:11,00:22:16,"So it's 28,000 years old, which is amazing."
00:22:16,00:22:20,"And it was found at the Hall of Fells cave in Switzerland, which"
00:22:20,00:22:23,is a cave where they found lots and lots of really ancient stuff.
00:22:23,00:22:26,And I just love this sentence about it.
00:22:26,00:22:29,It might have been used either as a sex toy
00:22:29,00:22:32,"or to do flint napping, where you sharpen flints"
00:22:32,00:22:33,to use this tool.
00:22:33,00:22:36,"And the BBC report said, the tubing and team working"
00:22:36,00:22:38,Hall of Fells already had 13 fractured parts
00:22:38,00:22:39,of the fallace in storage.
00:22:39,00:22:42,But it was only with the discovery of a 14th fragment last year
00:22:42,00:22:45,that the team was able finally to put the dicks all together.
00:22:45,00:22:47,[LAUGHTER]
00:22:47,00:22:48,What do they think?
00:22:48,00:22:51,"Well, they're making lots of shapes with it before that."
00:22:51,00:22:52,Is it an elephant?
00:22:52,00:22:53,Is it an airplane?
00:22:53,00:22:54,Is it another penis?
00:22:54,00:22:58,[LAUGHTER]
00:22:58,00:23:00,"Well, so that's the oldest man-made penis."
00:23:00,00:23:03,"But the oldest graffiti penis, cock and balls"
00:23:03,00:23:05,"that someone sketched out, the oldest known one,"
00:23:05,00:23:08,"was discovered last year, is 2,500 years old."
00:23:08,00:23:11,"And it's in this a gene island called Astipalaya,"
00:23:11,00:23:13,or Astipalaya.
00:23:13,00:23:15,And it was discovered when a Princeton professor
00:23:15,00:23:17,was taking a bunch of archeology students there
00:23:17,00:23:20,"to show them the wonders of the island, the island's archeology."
00:23:20,00:23:23,And they uncovered just hundreds of obscene pictures
00:23:23,00:23:24,and obscene graffiti.
00:23:24,00:23:29,So things like Nika Sittamos was here mounting tymiona
00:23:29,00:23:32,and various bits of abuse against people.
00:23:32,00:23:35,"And yeah, the first picture of a cock and balls"
00:23:35,00:23:37,are very clear penis and two testicles.
00:23:37,00:23:41,"And the Princeton professor said, Dr. Blackopoulos,"
00:23:41,00:23:43,"who found it, said, ""What we have found"
00:23:43,00:23:45,"is evidence that even then, people"
00:23:45,00:23:48,were using a coded language of symbols and imagery
00:23:48,00:23:49,"that was quite sophisticated."""
00:23:49,00:23:51,"I mean, it's not the Davinci code, is it?"
00:23:51,00:23:53,[LAUGHTER]
00:23:53,00:23:54,Should we track on them?
00:23:54,00:23:56,"Yeah, can I just mention this one last thing?"
00:23:56,00:23:57,"I think this has been said on QI before,"
00:23:57,00:24:01,"but I just really like it, which is the small penis rule."
00:24:01,00:24:02,And I'd never heard of it before.
00:24:02,00:24:05,And it's the idea that if you are in a novel trying
00:24:05,00:24:08,"a basic character of someone in real life,"
00:24:08,00:24:10,they can usually make an argument
00:24:10,00:24:12,that you've used them as the inspiration they can sue you.
00:24:12,00:24:15,So Michael Criton did this thing where he totally
00:24:15,00:24:16,took down someone in real life in his book.
00:24:16,00:24:18,"But then he added this little extra detail,"
00:24:18,00:24:21,"which was the character, has a small penis."
00:24:21,00:24:24,And the guy wasn't able to sue him because he had to admit
00:24:24,00:24:27,that he has a small penis if it was him.
00:24:27,00:24:28,I would just do that.
00:24:28,00:24:30,"And I'd say, OK, fine, but whatever you want."
00:24:30,00:24:34,"I'm sure you can say he has drawn a malicious portrait of me,"
00:24:34,00:24:36,and then he has given him another characteristic.
00:24:36,00:24:39,"Yeah, I mean, you would think, but it turns out it worked."
00:24:39,00:24:41,"And it's now known as the small penis rule,"
00:24:41,00:24:44,which is something that gets you out of being libelous.
00:24:44,00:24:45,"Yeah, because you could say that, couldn't you?"
00:24:45,00:24:47,But it's whether or not people are going to believe it.
00:24:47,00:24:51,Once they've seen the word small penis in a representation of you.
00:24:51,00:24:54,"I mean, no one's going to not say that that was a lie."
00:24:54,00:24:57,I think also the idea is not that it will get thrown out of court.
00:24:57,00:24:58,It's that you won't bring it to court.
00:24:58,00:24:59,You won't bring it to court.
00:24:59,00:25:02,There'll be a whole cross-examination on the length of your--
00:25:02,00:25:05,"Yeah, like the Barbra Streisandix effect, which we discussed last time."
00:25:05,00:25:08,"That's where you just don't want to draw attention to this,"
00:25:08,00:25:10,because then it'll probably get into the papers.
00:25:10,00:25:11,Yeah.
00:25:11,00:25:13,"It'll be very amusing for everyone, and then you'll feel--"
00:25:13,00:25:15,I read it the day about characters.
00:25:15,00:25:18,"This is a bit off topic, but you know Goldfinger."
00:25:18,00:25:19,Mm-hmm.
00:25:19,00:25:21,"This was named after Erno Goldfinger,"
00:25:21,00:25:24,"who's an architect who you try to tower and a few other things,"
00:25:24,00:25:26,elephant and castle and stuff.
00:25:26,00:25:30,And he apparently was furious that Alexander Fleming--
00:25:30,00:25:33,"No, that Ian Fleming had."
00:25:33,00:25:34,He was apparently furious that--
00:25:34,00:25:37,"Alexander Fleming had invented penicillin,"
00:25:37,00:25:42,"which really made the plot more difficult to, yeah."
00:25:42,00:25:43,Do you expect me to talk?
00:25:43,00:25:45,"No, Mr. Bond, I expect you to recover."
00:25:45,00:25:48,[LAUGHTER]
00:25:48,00:25:50,"Anyway, no."
00:25:50,00:25:53,"So yeah, he was apparently furious that--"
00:25:53,00:25:54,let's just call him Fleming.
00:25:54,00:25:59,He was furious that Fleming had used his name and threatened to sue.
00:25:59,00:26:01,And the publishers sort of like paid him off
00:26:01,00:26:03,and also said that they were going to put a thing at the start
00:26:03,00:26:05,"of the book saying it's not based on anyone,"
00:26:05,00:26:07,"and it's just a coincidence, right?"
00:26:07,00:26:08,And they all agree to that.
00:26:08,00:26:11,But Fleming wasn't very happy with that at all.
00:26:11,00:26:14,And he was so unhappy that he went to his publishers
00:26:14,00:26:18,and told them that he wanted to rename Goldfinger Goldpric.
00:26:18,00:26:20,[LAUGHTER]
00:26:20,00:26:28,"OK, time for our final pack of the show."
00:26:28,00:26:31,And that is Chazinski.
00:26:31,00:26:33,My fact is that the man who inspired the main character
00:26:33,00:26:37,in Jurassic Park is now building a chicken assaurus.
00:26:37,00:26:39,Which character in Jurassic Park is the main character?
00:26:39,00:26:40,The T-Rex.
00:26:40,00:26:41,I would have said the T-Rex.
00:26:41,00:26:43,[LAUGHTER]
00:26:43,00:26:44,He wants a friend.
00:26:44,00:26:47,"No, this is Jack Horner, who is the pedientologist"
00:26:47,00:26:48,on whom Sam Neill's character is based.
00:26:48,00:26:49,"Oh, cool."
00:26:49,00:26:50,And he's called in the film.
00:26:50,00:26:52,"But yet, he's a really famous pedientologist."
00:26:52,00:26:56,"And he is now building what he calls either a chicken assaurus,"
00:26:56,00:27:02,"or a dino chicken, which gives a general idea of what it is."
00:27:02,00:27:05,"How far has he got, if he's still on name, points right now?"
00:27:05,00:27:07,He's been rambling with that for a good decade or so.
00:27:07,00:27:09,"But no, he's got quite a long way."
00:27:09,00:27:12,So it's about genetically back-engineering
00:27:12,00:27:15,a chicken into being a dinosaur or into giving it
00:27:15,00:27:16,dinosaur characteristics.
00:27:16,00:27:18,And the three main things you need to change
00:27:18,00:27:20,are the tails that you've got to give the chicken a tail.
00:27:20,00:27:23,"Because at the moment, chickens have this thing"
00:27:23,00:27:25,"called a pigeon style, which is the thing that"
00:27:25,00:27:27,"doesn't make their tail feathers move, but it's not a tail."
00:27:27,00:27:29,"So give them a tail, give them claws like a dinosaur instead"
00:27:29,00:27:32,"of wings and give them a snout, not a beak."
00:27:32,00:27:33,And they--
00:27:33,00:27:35,And make them a hundred times bigger.
00:27:35,00:27:37,"You just blow into them for that, but it's true."
00:27:37,00:27:39,OK.
00:27:39,00:27:41,"And yeah, they've done the beak, I think."
00:27:41,00:27:43,"So the tail's the hardest, apparently,"
00:27:43,00:27:45,getting a tail on the thing.
00:27:45,00:27:46,I've seen a picture of what the beak would look like.
00:27:46,00:27:50,"It's pretty snout, rather than the beak, isn't it?"
00:27:50,00:27:51,"Yeah, exactly."
00:27:51,00:27:51,Yeah.
00:27:51,00:27:54,"Well, that's interesting, because birds had snouts"
00:27:54,00:27:56,for 50 million years.
00:27:56,00:27:58,So the beak is a relatively recent innovation.
00:27:58,00:27:59,And is it better?
00:27:59,00:28:00,I think they're all better in lots of ways.
00:28:00,00:28:01,"Yeah, yeah."
00:28:01,00:28:03,It must be more suited to whatever environment.
00:28:03,00:28:03,Yeah.
00:28:03,00:28:05,Because if it feels like maybe it's getting into small holes
00:28:05,00:28:09,"and stuff, it would be rubbish with this snout."
00:28:09,00:28:11,It just bruises nose constantly.
00:28:11,00:28:12,It seems with dinosaurs.
00:28:12,00:28:15,So they're now saying that they had feathers.
00:28:15,00:28:16,That's a theory coming up.
00:28:16,00:28:18,"I read on the other day that the Diplodocus,"
00:28:18,00:28:21,we all have this impression that the long necks
00:28:21,00:28:24,is that they go out on a sort of 45 degree angle.
00:28:24,00:28:26,"But actually, they were right up."
00:28:26,00:28:27,That's the new theory.
00:28:27,00:28:29,"Yeah, the new theories are going to be right vertically up."
00:28:29,00:28:30,Like a giraffe.
00:28:30,00:28:30,"Yeah, it was--"
00:28:30,00:28:32,"So they thought they were supposed to balance each other,"
00:28:32,00:28:34,because it was like the tail going out one way
00:28:34,00:28:35,and the neck going out the other way and stuff.
00:28:35,00:28:37,I think the tail goes right up as well.
00:28:37,00:28:38,"Yeah, that's right."
00:28:38,00:28:42,That's just what it's trying to get for a really tight leg.
00:28:42,00:28:47,"Or the goalposts, or American football."
00:28:47,00:28:49,"Do we know what kind of dinosaurs would have had feathers,"
00:28:49,00:28:50,or is the prevailing theory that all of them had feathers?
00:28:50,00:28:52,"Well, I think T-Rexes are saying--"
00:28:52,00:28:53,Yeah.
00:28:53,00:28:54,T-Rexes have feathers.
00:28:54,00:28:55,And they may not have had penises.
00:28:55,00:28:57,Any of them to take it back to penises.
00:28:57,00:29:00,"I think that's something that we're confident about, isn't it?"
00:29:00,00:29:00,"Well, no, no."
00:29:00,00:29:03,"I mean, we don't know that any dinosaurs had penises."
00:29:03,00:29:05,"And actually, we're not sure with a lot of them"
00:29:05,00:29:08,how mechanically they had sex.
00:29:08,00:29:09,"One of the things in looking to this,"
00:29:09,00:29:11,because Jack Horner's has a number of dinosaurs
00:29:11,00:29:12,named after him.
00:29:12,00:29:13,I--
00:29:13,00:29:14,Holosaurus.
00:29:14,00:29:15,"Yeah, maybe."
00:29:15,00:29:15,I don't know.
00:29:15,00:29:18,"Actually, do you have the names on you by any chance?"
00:29:18,00:29:19,Terichaptal.
00:29:19,00:29:21,Oh.
00:29:21,00:29:23,Terichaptal.
00:29:23,00:29:25,I thought I knew all the dinosaurs.
00:29:25,00:29:26,I thought they were like the classic.
00:29:26,00:29:28,I thought I knew them all.
00:29:28,00:29:30,Is this like when you thought you knew all the Roman numerals?
00:29:30,00:29:33,[LAUGHTER]
00:29:33,00:29:35,It turns out there's so many dinosaurs out there
00:29:35,00:29:39,that celebrities have dinosaurs named after them.
00:29:39,00:29:40,That's how many there are.
00:29:40,00:29:43,"Like, Attenborough has a dinosaur named after him."
00:29:43,00:29:44,Attenborough-Saurus.
00:29:44,00:29:45,Nice.
00:29:45,00:29:47,There's also Mark Knoffler from Dyer Straits.
00:29:47,00:29:49,The reason it's named after him is that when they were digging
00:29:49,00:29:52,"in this quarry, they seemed to find this new species"
00:29:52,00:29:55,anytime Dyer Straits was pumping out over the sound system.
00:29:55,00:29:57,"So they were just like, get Dyer Straits back on"
00:29:57,00:29:58,and they kept finding more.
00:29:58,00:30:00,So they gave that species to him.
00:30:00,00:30:04,And there's also an Elvis one called the Elvisaurus.
00:30:04,00:30:07,"And it was the first dinosaur to be discovered in Antarctica,"
00:30:07,00:30:08,which Elvis loved.
00:30:08,00:30:11,"You know, where Elvis spent a lot of time as a boy."
00:30:11,00:30:12,Where Elvis now lives.
00:30:12,00:30:15,[LAUGHTER]
00:30:15,00:30:17,"I found out really cool thing about chickens this week,"
00:30:17,00:30:20,which is that we have just found a new state of matter
00:30:20,00:30:23,in the eyeball of a chicken.
00:30:23,00:30:24,How cool is that?
00:30:24,00:30:25,I thought I knew all the states of matter.
00:30:25,00:30:27,"Not anymore, James."
00:30:27,00:30:30,"Yeah, no, you're pulling into my trap there."
00:30:30,00:30:32,"Yeah, so there were a few states of matter"
00:30:32,00:30:33,aside from the standard for.
00:30:33,00:30:37,"And this one is called disordered hyperuniformity,"
00:30:37,00:30:37,which is kind of cool.
00:30:37,00:30:39,"And it's an arrangement of molecules, which is really chaotic,"
00:30:39,00:30:40,if you look at it close up.
00:30:40,00:30:43,"And then over large spaces, it's got a kind of uniformity."
00:30:43,00:30:45,And it's apparently acts somewhere
00:30:45,00:30:46,"between a liquid and a crystal, I think."
00:30:46,00:30:48,"But yeah, it just rocked up in the eye of a chicken"
00:30:48,00:30:49,as they were studying it.
00:30:49,00:30:50,That's cool.
00:30:50,00:30:53,That's like when we have filums.
00:30:53,00:30:55,So every animal fits into a phylum.
00:30:55,00:30:58,And they found a whole new phylum.
00:30:58,00:31:00,And it was on the lobster's lip.
00:31:00,00:31:02,And it was just this total new type of life
00:31:02,00:31:04,that they'd not seen before.
00:31:04,00:31:05,How did they notice that?
00:31:05,00:31:05,I don't know.
00:31:05,00:31:06,How did they notice the chicken eye?
00:31:06,00:31:07,Yeah.
00:31:07,00:31:09,"Oh, this doesn't look like a state of matter I've"
00:31:09,00:31:10,seen anyone's eye before.
00:31:10,00:31:12,"Yeah, like how would you even begin to do that?"
00:31:12,00:31:14,So the industrial farming of chickens
00:31:14,00:31:17,was kind of a mistake the way it started.
00:31:17,00:31:17,"Oh, yeah."
00:31:17,00:31:18,Yeah.
00:31:18,00:31:19,Explain.
00:31:19,00:31:22,"Well, before 1923, when Hensel raised for meat,"
00:31:22,00:31:27,there were more or less a byproduct of egg laying birds.
00:31:27,00:31:29,"The end of an egg laying bird's life,"
00:31:29,00:31:31,it would be killed for meat.
00:31:31,00:31:33,But there wasn't quite the same tradition
00:31:33,00:31:35,of raising lots and lots and lots of birds.
00:31:35,00:31:38,"So traditional farming favored birds, which"
00:31:38,00:31:40,"were good for eggs and for meat, basically."
00:31:40,00:31:42,"And then in 1923, a woman from Delaware"
00:31:42,00:31:45,"called Mrs. Cecil Steele, just blazing,"
00:31:45,00:31:49,she accidentally ordered far too many birds.
00:31:49,00:31:51,She meant all of 50 and she got 500.
00:31:51,00:31:53,Was it like when you're doing your online shopping
00:31:53,00:31:55,and she accidentally bought a thousand of them?
00:31:55,00:31:57,"Yeah, exactly."
00:31:57,00:31:58,And so she sold them.
00:31:58,00:31:59,"And then the next year, she produced 1,000."
00:31:59,00:32:01,"And her neighbors started catching on thinking, oh, wait."
00:32:01,00:32:02,This is really good.
00:32:02,00:32:05,And there's more of a market for this than we thought there was.
00:32:05,00:32:06,So people like chicken.
00:32:06,00:32:10,"Yeah, in 1925, Delaware farmers made 50,000 birds."
00:32:10,00:32:11,"They grew 50,000 birds."
00:32:11,00:32:13,"In 1929, it was 3 million."
00:32:13,00:32:14,Wow.
00:32:14,00:32:15,"And in the election, Herbert Hoover,"
00:32:15,00:32:17,he promised a chicken in every pot.
00:32:17,00:32:20,And that was the kind of start of this incredible expansion
00:32:20,00:32:22,of battery farming.
00:32:22,00:32:23,"When people used to cook chickens,"
00:32:23,00:32:26,they used to want to make them sing for some reason.
00:32:26,00:32:27,"Or when it's just come out the oven,"
00:32:27,00:32:29,they used to want to make it sing.
00:32:29,00:32:33,And what they used to do is put mercury inside the chicken
00:32:33,00:32:35,and then kind of sew it up.
00:32:35,00:32:38,And then that would kind of expand and make air inside the chicken.
00:32:38,00:32:40,"And then they make a tiny hole, I think."
00:32:40,00:32:42,And then it would kind of tweet.
00:32:42,00:32:44,"Wow, that's so clever."
00:32:44,00:32:45,It's amazing.
00:32:45,00:32:47,"It's clever, apart from the fact that it's highly close."
00:32:47,00:32:49,"Yeah, you're a dinner."
00:32:49,00:32:50,"It's worth it, though, for that."
00:32:50,00:32:55,"So it's like taking it out and the chicken going, tada!"
00:32:55,00:32:58,Not everyone is happy with the chicken asaurus idea
00:32:58,00:32:59,of making a chicken asaurus.
00:32:59,00:33:04,So one of the colleagues of Dr. Horner has said this.
00:33:04,00:33:06,It was in BBC report.
00:33:06,00:33:08,"Has he said, get back in your corner, Jack."
00:33:08,00:33:09,"No, he hasn't."
00:33:09,00:33:10,He should have done.
00:33:10,00:33:11,He should have.
00:33:11,00:33:13,Can I say he gets that a lot?
00:33:13,00:33:16,"He said, technically, you're going to have a messed up chicken."
00:33:16,00:33:16,It's not a dinosaur.
00:33:16,00:33:18,It's never going to be a dinosaur.
00:33:18,00:33:20,It's just going to be a really awful monstrosity.
00:33:20,00:33:21,"I would agree with that, actually."
00:33:21,00:33:23,I think what you're making is not a dinosaur.
00:33:23,00:33:26,"You're making a chicken with dinosaur characteristics, right?"
00:33:26,00:33:29,"But if all the genes survive somewhere,"
00:33:29,00:33:30,I find that really interesting.
00:33:30,00:33:32,So the idea is that chickens somewhere
00:33:32,00:33:36,"will have DNA that was inside dinosaurs, right?"
00:33:36,00:33:38,"Well, some of it will be inactive or some of it"
00:33:38,00:33:40,would have been thrown away or just evolved away over it.
00:33:40,00:33:42,What is true is that the chicken that you had for dinner
00:33:42,00:33:44,"yesterday, its parents were chicken."
00:33:44,00:33:46,"That chicken's parents were chicken, and they were chicken,"
00:33:46,00:33:48,"and they were chicken, and they were chicken."
00:33:48,00:33:50,"And then if you got far enough, their parents"
00:33:50,00:33:51,would have been a dinosaur.
00:33:51,00:33:52,I think that's so cool.
00:33:52,00:33:54,"I think one of the main things is, say, for instance,"
00:33:54,00:33:55,a tail.
00:33:55,00:33:57,A chicken embryo has a tail.
00:33:57,00:34:00,But then it kind of gets reabsorbed back into the embryo.
00:34:00,00:34:02,And there's a gene that does that.
00:34:02,00:34:04,"If you can turn that gene off, then tail will continue"
00:34:04,00:34:07,"to grow, and then you'll have a chicken with a tail."
00:34:07,00:34:09,And actually human embryos also have tails.
00:34:09,00:34:09,"So, really?"
00:34:09,00:34:11,"Yeah, we reabsorbed them as well."
00:34:11,00:34:14,"Theoretically, if you could find the gene in humans"
00:34:14,00:34:16,"and turn that off, then you could have humans with tails."
00:34:16,00:34:19,"Would it be a hairy tail, like a monkey's tail?"
00:34:19,00:34:21,"But Sharon, I would say it must be."
00:34:21,00:34:22,"I know, because it would be, but then again--"
00:34:22,00:34:24,Because it hasn't evolved with the rest of us.
00:34:24,00:34:25,"Yeah, we've been on hairy."
00:34:25,00:34:28,Humans aren't hairy all over like that.
00:34:28,00:34:28,By them.
00:34:28,00:34:31,[LAUGHTER]
00:34:31,00:34:33,"They think, getting the tail reabsorption"
00:34:33,00:34:36,gene to stop turning off is something they think they might
00:34:36,00:34:40,"crack, because they've worked out how to turn on a gecko's tail"
00:34:40,00:34:41,reabsorption.
00:34:41,00:34:44,"So, scientists have learned how to make a gecko embryo"
00:34:44,00:34:45,reabsorb its own tail.
00:34:45,00:34:46,This is so exciting.
00:34:46,00:34:47,Yeah.
00:34:47,00:34:49,"I think in the future, when you're having a baby,"
00:34:49,00:34:53,you'll be able to tick all the boxes for you to tail.
00:34:53,00:34:57,"Will it be, will it be, will it be, pushed, clipped?"
00:34:57,00:34:57,It's fraggly.
00:34:57,00:35:01,"OK, that's it."
00:35:01,00:35:02,That's all of our facts.
