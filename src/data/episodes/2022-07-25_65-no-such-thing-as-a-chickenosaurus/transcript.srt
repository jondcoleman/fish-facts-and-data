1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,580
 This is how it works.

2
00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:18,260
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast

3
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:21,240
 coming to you from the QI offices in Covent Garden.

4
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:22,240
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

5
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:27,180
 I'm sitting here with Andy Murray, James Harkin, and Anna Chazinski, and once again we have

6
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:31,020
 gathered around the microphone with our four favorite facts from the last seven days,

7
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:35,580
 and in a particular order, here we go, starting with Andy.

8
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:39,940
 My fact is that fish who work as cleaners can cheat their bosses and their bosses can

9
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:43,060
 punish them.

10
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:45,180
 So this is incredible.

11
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:49,580
 There are fish, as I'm sure you know, who clean other fish, as in they eat parasites

12
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:50,580
 from the skin.

13
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:54,540
 So you get cleaner fish and client fish is what they're technically known as.

14
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:58,520
 And there have been lots of studies of this, especially by this amazing sounding ecologist

15
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:03,680
 called Reduane Bacheri, I hope I'm pronouncing his name right, who has studied these guys

16
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:04,680
 so much.

17
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:09,960
 And basically, the trade is for food versus clean skin, but the cleaner fish they sometimes

18
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:14,120
 cheat because they actually like eating the thick mucus that covers the client fish as

19
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:19,280
 a protective layer, and they often have a cheeky bite of it instead of eating a parasite.

20
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:22,560
 And that makes the client fish jump, I guess, in pain.

21
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:25,920
 So that's them cheating it and then their bosses, the client fish punish them by chasing

22
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,680
 them around.

23
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:32,080
 And the cleaner fish which have been chased around, they behave better in future.

24
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:35,040
 They stop misbehaving as much when they've been chased about.

25
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,680
 What are they threatening to do when they chase them around?

26
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:41,720
 Because in the end, they want to be making contact with, it's like being chased around

27
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:42,920
 by someone you really fancy.

28
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:50,080
 It's like being chased by your boss, you know, because they're often bigger fish or

29
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,080
 they're often predatory.

30
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:54,060
 Being chased by your boss.

31
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:58,240
 Secretive QI experts.

32
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:01,680
 So yeah, if there are lots of client fish, then the cleaners have the upper hand because

33
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,880
 they're more in demand.

34
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:06,680
 And so they try and take more bites of mucus because they know that they've got a captive

35
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:07,680
 market.

36
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,680
 Right?

37
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:09,680
 Yeah.

38
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:10,680
 Because the client fish have to get clean somewhere.

39
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:11,680
 Yeah.

40
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:12,680
 Genius.

41
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:14,760
 So they propagate the problem in order that they can solve it, which is kind of exactly

42
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:17,360
 what a lot of human industry does, right?

43
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:20,640
 I guess so, yeah, how do they propagate the problem?

44
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,520
 Are they making it worse?

45
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:24,040
 They're tricking the...

46
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:25,040
 Not really.

47
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:27,440
 No, because they're not luring the number of client fish available.

48
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,440
 Okay.

49
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,440
 You know what I mean?

50
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,440
 But client fish...

51
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:33,720
 No, actually, they're sort of up because client fish remove their customer if they get

52
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:36,040
 bad service.

53
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:40,520
 And they kind of keep going back to the same species or the same fish that they really

54
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:42,280
 like and have good service from, don't they?

55
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,280
 Yeah.

56
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,280
 Really?

57
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,280
 Yeah.

58
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,280
 Okay, that's really cool.

59
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:49,000
 Huge service stations, so there are hundreds of them or something.

60
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
 Yeah, they have...

61
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,200
 They're all over the ocean, especially on reefs, that's whether you get them.

62
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,200
 There are these...

63
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:56,200
 Just a big welcome break of cleaners, yeah.

64
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,200
 Basically...

65
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,200
 A big shell.

66
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,200
 Yeah.

67
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,200
 (laughter)

68
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,200
 Cool.

69
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:06,360
 Yeah, a single cleaner fish inspects more than two hundred two thousand three hundred

70
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,360
 fish a day.

71
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,360
 Wow.

72
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:10,040
 And it eats about twelve hundred parasites.

73
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:12,240
 That's an impressive rate of work.

74
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:17,800
 And some client fish had themselves cleaned every five minutes.

75
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:18,800
 So vain.

76
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:19,800
 Celebrity client fish.

77
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:20,800
 Yeah.

78
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,920
 So this isn't quite a recent discovery, right?

79
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:23,920
 Yeah, yeah.

80
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:24,920
 This is a scuba diver who is...

81
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:25,920
 Yeah.

82
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:30,440
 Which is really cool because it just makes me wonder, what are the mysteries of fish, you

83
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:31,440
 know?

84
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,440
 There's so many things that we don't...

85
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:33,440
 Like, I was reading as well.

86
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:34,440
 There's a...

87
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:37,360
 I can't remember what the fish is called now, but it's a fish that basically sun bathes.

88
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:40,000
 It goes to the surface of the water and it just lays it for half the day.

89
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,520
 They've had no idea why it does that until recently they just put a camera on it and worked

90
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:46,480
 out that it was going really deep and it was...

91
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:50,760
 And it was finding all these other little things to eat and the coldness meant that it needed

92
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:54,520
 to get up there to get the heat back down, like just to regulate their body temperature.

93
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,520
 Yeah.

94
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,520
 But they didn't know that up until recently.

95
00:03:56,520 --> 00:04:00,080
 So we've just had floating sunbathing fish up until a year or so ago.

96
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:03,680
 Well, so they're just warming themselves up so that they can conserve heat to go back down

97
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,680
 to the cold water.

98
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,680
 I think they're called sunfish.

99
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:07,680
 Yes, sunfish.

100
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,440
 It's a cool thing. They get cleaned themselves by albatrosses.

101
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:11,440
 No!

102
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:12,440
 No!

103
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:13,440
 That doesn't sound like cleaning.

104
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:15,440
 That sounds like the albatross is trying to eat them.

105
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:16,440
 No!

106
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:17,440
 It doesn't quite get to go.

107
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:18,440
 No, because they're huge.

108
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:22,440
 It's what the biggest ever found weighed 2.3 Tarras, they're massive.

109
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:23,440
 Oh, yeah, they're massive.

110
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:26,520
 And when they get infested with these parasites, which obviously they suck their blood and

111
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:30,800
 they're horrible, albatrosses land nearby as they sunbathe and pick the parasites off

112
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:31,800
 them.

113
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:32,800
 Wow.

114
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:33,800
 Isn't that incredible?

115
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:34,800
 Yeah, that's pretty cool.

116
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:38,600
 It's kind of for some reason, it reminds me of humpback whales, get parasites on them.

117
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,600
 Don't they?

118
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,600
 They get lice on them.

119
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:44,520
 And that's when you see a whale breaching and then like jumping out of the water and then

120
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:47,920
 splashing back down again, it's often trying to dislodge the parasites.

121
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:51,640
 Is that the equivalent of a dog dragging itself along the ground?

122
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:55,520
 But it's slightly more romantic than that, yeah.

123
00:04:55,520 --> 00:05:00,320
 Because you don't get couples going on special holidays to watch dogs dragging themselves

124
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,120
 along the ground.

125
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:05,680
 I don't know if I've seen that.

126
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,000
 Do you have a sick dog?

127
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:19,520
 No, I've never seen it in real life, but I've seen it in cartoons and stuff.

128
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,560
 I've seen it in cartoons and stuff.

129
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:25,760
 Tom and Jerry's changed, isn't it?

130
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:30,560
 So this is another parasite, so Oxpeckas have a similar relationship to things like rhinos

131
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,560
 and buffaloes.

132
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:32,560
 What's Oxpeckas?

133
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,920
 It's a kind of bird.

134
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:34,920
 So an Oxpeck.

135
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:35,920
 Oxes.

136
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:36,920
 It sure does.

137
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:37,920
 Ah.

138
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:40,480
 It packs Oxen and Zebra's and rhinos.

139
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:42,320
 It's a fitting name.

140
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:45,400
 And so it sits on them and it eats ticks and parasites that live on them.

141
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:50,160
 But they also trick their hosts because they obviously, they've got a vested interest in

142
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:53,960
 getting more ticks and parasites to come and, you know, land on these animals.

143
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:57,760
 And so they exacerbate their wounds or if they've got a bit of blood, bloodied wound

144
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:00,520
 exposed, then the Oxpeckas will come and peck it, make it a bit worse.

145
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:04,640
 To make sure that more parasites come and then they can eat the parasites.

146
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:05,640
 Really?

147
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:10,160
 It's like a cleaner who makes your house more dirty.

148
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,160
 Just so more cleaners come.

149
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,800
 I think I'm going to need to hire another cleaner.

150
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:15,800
 Fuck you.

151
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,560
 You've just got hundreds of cleaners here.

152
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:20,600
 I'm a dirty, dirty, dirty house.

153
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,600
 Yeah.

154
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:25,120
 So there is, there are really cool photos on the mail of, there's a 13-year-old who went

155
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:28,440
 snorkeling in Indonesia and he persuaded a shrimp to clean his teeth.

156
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:29,440
 Wow.

157
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,440
 Yeah.

158
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:31,440
 He saved persuades.

159
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,440
 Come on.

160
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:33,440
 Yeah.

161
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,440
 Come on.

162
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:35,440
 I'm not going to tell anyone.

163
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,440
 He's probably going to enjoy it.

164
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:38,400
 He snorkeled down to whether it, because he's, he found a cleaning station.

165
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:42,360
 One of these garages, basically, where they, they, and they, they, there it's not fish.

166
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,360
 It's shrimp.

167
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,400
 It just happens to be owned and operated by shrimp.

168
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:49,400
 And, um, he opened his mouth and it went into his mouth and it removed bits of food from

169
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,400
 between his teeth.

170
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,400
 Wow.

171
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:52,400
 Yeah, I've seen that.

172
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,400
 It's pretty gross.

173
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,400
 Unbelievable.

174
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,400
 Cool.

175
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:56,400
 I'll put up pictures of it on Twitter.

176
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,400
 If you've just been eating shrimp, though, that wouldn't be very nice.

177
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,400
 Oh my god.

178
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,400
 That's true.

179
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,400
 That's a good boy.

180
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,400
 Jeff?

181
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,400
 Okay.

182
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,400
 That's like having a car made of mechanics.

183
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:13,440
 Um, quite an expensive dental treatment, I think, flying to Bali every time you clean your

184
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:14,440
 teeth.

185
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:15,440
 A toothpick.

186
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,440
 We'll do the job.

187
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:19,000
 Um, but they're, they're also, they're a mimic fish.

188
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
 So clean a fish have a bright blue stripe along them often or really, they're really brightly

189
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,160
 coming to, kind of, to advertise themselves and say, hey, look, I'm here on bright and

190
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,520
 I'm, I'm happy to clean your teeth.

191
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:28,240
 Um, or eat the parasites or whatever.

192
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:32,040
 But they're a mimic fish, which have evolved the same kind of stripe, hang around near

193
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:36,400
 cleaner fish and just go around taking chunks out of just eating the mucus only.

194
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,400
 Yeah, eating the mucus only.

195
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,400
 Exactly.

196
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:42,400
 And that, that damage is trade because it makes fish at the station more nervy.

197
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:46,880
 And these stations, they're like, um, um, what's a good, they're like neutral territory

198
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:47,880
 in the ocean.

199
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:51,800
 So you get even sharks turning up to have the parasites cleaned up and they don't eat fish

200
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:56,880
 that they would normally be hunting and killing and eating because it's kind of safe,

201
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,320
 it's a safe zone for all fish.

202
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:59,320
 Okay.

203
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:04,240
 So if you fall out of the boat in the middle of the ocean, what you need to do is find one

204
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:08,720
 of these areas and then no sharks will eat you because you're safe and then you're, you're

205
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:09,720
 in the neutral zone.

206
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:10,720
 Exactly.

207
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,720
 Yeah.

208
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:12,720
 And you get a good floss.

209
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:13,720
 Mine is out there.

210
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:20,560
 Um, my favourite mutualism, like mutualistic relationship underwater is actually shrimp based.

211
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:25,040
 It's, uh, the relationship between shrimps and goby fish who's in this, so shrimps and goby

212
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:29,520
 fish have this really sweet relationship where the goby fish gets the shrimp to build its,

213
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:33,400
 so the goby fish lives in, um, little dugouts in the sand at the bottom of the ocean.

214
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:36,360
 And it gets, employs the shrimp to build its little dugout.

215
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:41,200
 Um, and then it keeps the shrimp on as a permanent cleaner to clean its house.

216
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:45,840
 So they've lived together in this house and the goby shrimp is employing, the goby fish

217
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:48,240
 is employing the shrimp to clean his house and to build it.

218
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,240
 But what are you paying for?

219
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:53,200
 And in exchange, the, because the shrimp doesn't have very good eyesight, so can't really

220
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:57,000
 spot when predators are coming, so the goby fish sits at the top of the borough and looks

221
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,120
 out for predators and they're always in contact, so the goby fish always has a little fin touching

222
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,120
 the shrimp.

223
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:05,060
 And if there's a predator who, like, wave his fin at the shrimp, it'll be like, go back in

224
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:06,060
 the hole.

225
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:08,560
 Sounds like a great sitcom, doesn't it?

226
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:09,560
 Yeah.

227
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:14,640
 But also, the, the other shark or fish, whatever, must know that the goby is hiding, you're going

228
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:15,640
 to shrimp at home today?

229
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:16,640
 Oh, no.

230
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:17,640
 No, tired him.

231
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:18,640
 He was, he wasn't doing a good job, but...

232
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:21,640
 Was that what you hold it on to down there?

233
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:22,640
 I don't know.

234
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,760
 So, me or Finn, the other one.

235
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:25,760
 Yeah.

236
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:32,040
 So, some of these cleaner fish, if they eat too much, if you're a female cleaner fish, if

237
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:35,840
 you eat too much, you turn into a male, so you get bigger and bigger and you turn into

238
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:36,840
 a male.

239
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:37,840
 Right?

240
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:40,080
 It's, I don't quite know how that works, but it does work.

241
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:45,040
 And apparently there's some very new research that says that male cleaner fish will aggressively

242
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:48,440
 nudge their mates to watch their diet.

243
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:54,160
 So, if they're eating too much, because I like, stop it, you'll turn into a male.

244
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:58,220
 That is so good.

245
00:09:58,220 --> 00:10:01,680
 Okay, time for fact number two.

246
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:06,720
 My fact this week is that al-Qaeda's job application form includes a question asking who

247
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:10,920
 should be contacted in the event that the applicant becomes a martyr.

248
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:14,360
 Now, I have a lot of questions about that.

249
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:15,360
 Yeah.

250
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,960
 There's, where is the job application form available?

251
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:21,360
 Okay, so they found this as a part of, basically, when they raided Bin Laden's house and when

252
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:24,520
 Bin Laden was taken down, they took all the stuff from his house.

253
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:29,120
 He was applying for a job, so now all you have to do is go to Bin Laden's house and then

254
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,360
 pick up a form there.

255
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,720
 It's very easy.

256
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:36,920
 But so they, they found a lot of books, they found a lot of papers, obviously, and the government

257
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:40,360
 hadn't released it for a long time, and it's just been released, and part of the papers

258
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:43,400
 that were found in his house was the al-Qaeda job applicant form.

259
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:46,920
 There are lots of questions like, what objectives would you like to accomplish on

260
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:47,920
 your G-head path?

261
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:56,360
 I guess they don't ask, where will you be in the next five years?

262
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:58,240
 And hobbies, they want to know hobbies?

263
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,240
 Really?

264
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,240
 Yeah.

265
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,240
 Hobbies and pastimes is another question.

266
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:03,800
 Do you know that Bin Laden was a really good volleyball player?

267
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:04,800
 No, do.

268
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:05,800
 Is he?

269
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:06,800
 Yeah, he was.

270
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:11,840
 Whenever they used to have volleyball competitions in al-Qaeda, he and Mohammed Atef had to

271
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:15,360
 be on different teams because they were both by far the best players.

272
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,360
 Wow.

273
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:17,360
 He taught, wasn't he?

274
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,360
 Yeah, he was.

275
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:21,760
 But was he really good in the way that we've often said Kim Jong-un is great at golf?

276
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:25,720
 You know, like, were people just letting him win every shot, kind of thing?

277
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:26,720
 Maybe.

278
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:27,720
 I wanted to.

279
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:28,720
 I thought he was on dialysis.

280
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:31,920
 This might have been earlier before the dialysis.

281
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:32,920
 Okay.

282
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:34,920
 Because a lot of the best volleyball players are not on dialysis.

283
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:35,920
 It's true.

284
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:36,920
 That's a good fact.

285
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:40,200
 It's possibly Nintendo Wii that he was on volleyball on as well.

286
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,640
 I suppose if you have to stay indoors all the time.

287
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:43,640
 Exactly.

288
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:47,320
 Well, was he found with some kind of games console or no, he had loads of DVDs.

289
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:48,320
 Lots of DVDs.

290
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,320
 Lots of pornography.

291
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,320
 Lots of pornography.

292
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,320
 No.

293
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:52,320
 Yeah, they've not released the titles.

294
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,320
 But they said that had he had a big.

295
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,320
 Yeah.

296
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,320
 No, I don't know what.

297
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:56,320
 Tell me.

298
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,320
 Yeah, yeah.

299
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:59,320
 Because they've said that he had a lot of books and they released the titles of the books

300
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:03,920
 that he had, which included known Chomsky books and really oddly conspiracy theory books

301
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,840
 about 9/11, which is really interesting.

302
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:06,840
 Oh, really?

303
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:07,840
 Yeah, yeah.

304
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:08,840
 He had a lot of them.

305
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:09,840
 And a huge stash of pornography.

306
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,960
 They've not told us what they are.

307
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:17,520
 One thing that said though is that apparently extremists often have pornography as a way

308
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:18,520
 of communicating.

309
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:19,520
 So they'll have coded messages within a--

310
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:20,520
 Oh, yeah, that is true.

311
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:21,520
 Yeah.

312
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:27,120
 Stagnography, it's called, which is when you put messages in pictures and terrorists usually

313
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,120
 use pornography.

314
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:34,200
 Well, so they set up a porn shoot in order that they can plant a message into the scene somewhere.

315
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:37,640
 I think they use existing photos.

316
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:45,840
 That is the most convoluted excuse for seeing naked women-- I'm looking for a message.

317
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,920
 To look really closely at this one, I'm afraid.

318
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:48,920
 Probably for hours.

319
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:53,240
 I'm probably going to take it with me, actually, guys.

320
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:57,760
 I'd like to thank you for this fact, Dan, because now in the course of researching application

321
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:05,920
 forms for terrorism, I have, in my Google record, the phrase "apply to join ISIS."

322
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:11,760
 And as I speak on the UN terror watch list, you probably are.

323
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:12,760
 That's a way to think that--

324
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:13,760
 Yeah.

325
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:14,760
 We'll have alerted some time and some time.

326
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:17,160
 I've been in it five minutes ago, and now that's never leaving me.

327
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:21,560
 Isn't there a, like, a removals company in the UK called ISIS, or used to be called

328
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:22,560
 ISIS?

329
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:23,560
 And then they had to change their name.

330
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:24,840
 Or is a building company awesome?

331
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:26,760
 There are lots of-- there are lots of firms, actually.

332
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:30,720
 So there's-- and someers, they were bringing out a line called ISIS.

333
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,640
 I think we've mentioned this on the podcast before.

334
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:36,320
 And they said, well, it's too late to change it now.

335
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:39,480
 We've been working on this for six months.

336
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:44,360
 The best one was about that is the people who had a 21st birthday party.

337
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:45,360
 Do you remember that?

338
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,360
 No.

339
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:47,360
 So it's a 21st birthday party.

340
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:50,560
 They had two balloons that said 21st or 2 in a 1.

341
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:53,480
 But from the other side of the room, it looked like ISIS.

342
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:55,520
 So from outside, it looked like ISIS.

343
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:58,320
 And people called the police and said, we think there's a--

344
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,320
 You know, I know.

345
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:00,320
 Like, as if they--

346
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,320
 That's birthday party.

347
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:03,320
 That is, if they'd advertise where they were with--

348
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:05,320
 I don't know if they have ISIS balloons.

349
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:08,600
 They don't seem like the kind of party balloon sort of guys.

350
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,200
 I was an Oxford a few weeks ago.

351
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:13,640
 And there was an NHS sort of small building that

352
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:16,200
 was called ISIS out on the front of it as well.

353
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:18,600
 And right next to the sign ISIS, there was another sign

354
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:21,960
 that they put outside in paper that said, please do not

355
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,920
 lean your bicycle against our wall.

356
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:26,640
 And you're like, I am definitely not going to lean on it.

357
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:28,760
 No bicycles on that wall.

358
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:30,600
 It's fantastic.

359
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:33,200
 You know the question that you get asked on forms

360
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,720
 so the US visa form.

361
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,360
 I mean, there's some very, very way questions.

362
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:40,400
 Like, are you coming to the US to engage in prostitution?

363
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:42,840
 Do you belong to a clan or tribe?

364
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:45,960
 And have you ever been responsible for quotes, particularly

365
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:48,480
 severe violations of religious freedom?

366
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:52,480
 So presumably trivial violations of religious freedom

367
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:53,000
 are OK.

368
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,800
 But do you know the reason they do this?

369
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,040
 No, you have to answer all these.

370
00:14:56,040 --> 00:15:00,520
 Is it because then if you answer it and you lie,

371
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:02,440
 then they can kick you out because you've lie done a fart.

372
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:03,280
 Yes.

373
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:06,560
 So that they have a reason to say you've

374
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,880
 obtained a visa by fraud or misrepresentation.

375
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,360
 And that in itself is enough of a reason

376
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:11,440
 to ask you to leave the country.

377
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,440
 So that's why they do it.

378
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:14,760
 Did you see the Mexican visa application one?

379
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:15,520
 No, no.

380
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:16,920
 So this is one of the questions on it.

381
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:20,360
 Since been taken off, describe your mustache slash beard.

382
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:25,440
 That can not be true.

383
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,960
 That's the number of people are written.

384
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:29,920
 This was in either the independent or the telegraph.

385
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:32,720
 They did a survey of questions you've

386
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:33,960
 been asked on a visa form.

387
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:35,600
 Did you check the data on that?

388
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,160
 Because that does sound very--

389
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:38,960
 I was suspect it was one respondent.

390
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:41,880
 And he said the options were scant, bushy, or clipped.

391
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:47,960
 I have to say, I wasn't going to read this out either.

392
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:50,000
 It's too much of a risk.

393
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,520
 Hey, one guy claimed it.

394
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:52,200
 I believe it.

395
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:55,960
 Did you see that job application in The Alps of Silly,

396
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:58,280
 which was for an air traffic controller?

397
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:00,240
 And it was in Braille.

398
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,320
 Oh, really?

399
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:02,360
 Yeah.

400
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:04,800
 And they were like, well, all of our job applications

401
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:08,040
 have to come in all the different in Braille, as well as in--

402
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:08,560
 Yeah, yeah.

403
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:09,760
 I'm writing, so.

404
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:10,680
 Scary stuff.

405
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:11,560
 That was it, isn't it?

406
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:12,400
 Yeah.

407
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:14,960
 In Russia, to get your dry cleaning done,

408
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:18,640
 you have to sign your signature five times,

409
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:20,520
 and feel it in a larger number of forms.

410
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:22,000
 There's a really good essay on the Guardian website

411
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,560
 about Bureaucracy in Russia.

412
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:30,040
 And how lots of Soviet Bureaucracy has basically survived.

413
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:30,520
 OK.

414
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:34,320
 That doesn't sound like it would be true in all dry cleaners.

415
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:37,720
 Maybe it isn't, especially bureaucratic dry cleaning.

416
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:38,760
 Is it just one form?

417
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:41,480
 And there's five signature lines at the bottom.

418
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:43,720
 Sounds like dry cleaners is a euphemism for something,

419
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:47,200
 like cleaning the streets of London of bit treacherous.

420
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:51,120
 I was at a hotel once, and the person reception asked me

421
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:54,520
 for my two signatures, and I said, I've only got one.

422
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:57,360
 And I think it's the funniest thing I've ever said in my life.

423
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,040
 She didn't even--

424
00:16:58,040 --> 00:16:59,120
 I've heard that if you're funny yet.

425
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:11,640
 OK, time for fact number three, and that is James.

426
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:15,520
 OK, my fact this week is that the single biggest expense

427
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:18,080
 in the computer game LEGO Universe

428
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:20,960
 was to hire human moderators to make sure

429
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:25,360
 that people weren't making LEGO penises.

430
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:27,000
 So penis monitoring?

431
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,840
 What it was, it's one of those games, like Minecraft,

432
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:30,920
 where you can build things and whatever.

433
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:33,000
 And a lot of people, of course, when you can build anything

434
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,720
 you want, if you can draw anything you want,

435
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,800
 a lot of people draw penises.

436
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:38,880
 And they wanted to come up with a way

437
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,120
 of stopping people from doing this,

438
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:42,960
 because they wanted other people to go into your world.

439
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:45,360
 And they didn't want children stumbling

440
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,920
 into the world of someone who built a penis.

441
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:49,640
 And so they tried to get a computer

442
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:52,480
 to be able to work out when the repinises around,

443
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,560
 but the computer couldn't do it.

444
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:56,360
 They just-- it was impossible to come up

445
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:58,960
 with a program that would definitely recognize

446
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:01,400
 a LEGO penis above anything else.

447
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:03,480
 Like sometimes they'd say something was a penis,

448
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:05,320
 and actually it was a building, and sometimes they

449
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:06,640
 would miss one or whatever.

450
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,120
 And so the only way to get around it

451
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:11,560
 was to get a moderation team who would check every single

452
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:15,160
 erection to check that it wasn't a penis.

453
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,080
 Oh my god.

454
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:18,600
 And it cost them a fortune, and that was probably

455
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:20,160
 why it went off.

456
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,840
 And this was tweeted by a lady called Megan Fox,

457
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:24,840
 who was a developer who worked on the projects,

458
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:27,680
 and it was picked up by a website called Fusion.net,

459
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:29,520
 who wrote an article about it last week.

460
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:32,200
 See, I didn't know that Megan Fox had been branching out.

461
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,200
 Yeah.

462
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,200
 Good work.

463
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,640
 You can-- just for the sake of it,

464
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:38,760
 you can actually reach her on glass, bottom Meg.

465
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:39,840
 That's her actual Twitter handle.

466
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,920
 So if anyone has any questions following this podcast--

467
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,320
 Yeah, don't ask me.

468
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:44,240
 Go straight to Megan.

469
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:45,080
 Wow.

470
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:47,240
 Penises stop the LEGO universe game.

471
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:48,040
 That's such a shame.

472
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:50,240
 It's such a victory for--

473
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:50,760
 Willie.

474
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:53,680
 It's not a victory for innocence and joyfulness and play.

475
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:54,200
 Yeah.

476
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:56,280
 It's a victory for people building enormous penises.

477
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:57,320
 Yeah.

478
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:58,680
 But can't they, like on most websites,

479
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:00,240
 you have the ability to have a parent lock.

480
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,040
 Can they just do a kind of parent lock?

481
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:04,920
 And stop children from playing the LEGO computer game.

482
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:06,720
 Maybe-- no, no, no, no, maybe if you--

483
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:07,080
 Warning.

484
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:07,880
 It splits a penis.

485
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:08,720
 It's a penis only.

486
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:11,800
 Maybe it's an adult if you register your penis in it.

487
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:16,360
 Like you say, I have built a penis in my universe.

488
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:18,240
 And they go, penis is something you have to do

489
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:22,760
 when you've done something much worse than a LEGO game.

490
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:24,600
 Well, the point is it's people--

491
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,240
 they're not worried about the people who

492
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,320
 are going to register it.

493
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:30,400
 It's the people who nefariously build these penises.

494
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,120
 And they can you just stop them.

495
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:33,800
 Because penises look a lot like other stuff.

496
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:35,400
 Yeah, they look like buildings.

497
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,400
 Snails.

498
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,600
 [LAUGHTER]

499
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:40,600
 Other penises.

500
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:42,680
 Other penises.

501
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:43,600
 Should we ban this?

502
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:44,560
 It could be a penis.

503
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:46,280
 But also, it could just be another penis.

504
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:47,480
 In which case?

505
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:48,560
 We should leave it.

506
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:51,080
 I was reading today just on LEGO.

507
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:55,360
 That Cambridge is thinking of creating a new post

508
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:58,040
 for a professor, the professor of LEGO.

509
00:19:58,040 --> 00:19:59,640
 Not just thinking, I think they are doing it.

510
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:00,160
 Yeah.

511
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,560
 So you're going to be made of LEGO.

512
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:04,280
 With loads of LEGO undergraduates as well.

513
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:05,080
 [LAUGHTER]

514
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:05,920
 That'd be really cool.

515
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:09,040
 They basically, LEGO provided them, supposedly,

516
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:12,080
 with 2.5 mil to create the post.

517
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:14,200
 And it's going to be about play in education and stuff

518
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:14,720
 like that.

519
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,840
 Yeah, there might be a professor of LEGO now.

520
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:19,840
 OK, so things that computers can't do, maybe.

521
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:21,880
 So the US is spending a lot of money

522
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:25,440
 to try and get facial recognition on people

523
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,200
 when they're going through airports

524
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,640
 to kind of see if they look like a terrorist.

525
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:32,600
 And supposedly, there might be some little micro expressions

526
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:34,560
 that people give off, like, if they're

527
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:38,040
 worried by the fact that they have to go through security.

528
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:39,680
 But apparently, the face of a man

529
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:42,840
 about a detonator suicide belt has the same expression

530
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:45,600
 as a man who realises he has left the stovon.

531
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:46,600
 [LAUGHTER]

532
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:47,120
 Oh, wow.

533
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,320
 That's why they can't tell.

534
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:50,880
 No, and I left the suicide belt in the stov.

535
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:53,280
 Oh, this is a disaster.

536
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:55,560
 It's not a-- because that's what the human face is.

537
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:59,120
 There's not a specific expression for a specific situation.

538
00:20:59,120 --> 00:20:59,880
 It's an emotion.

539
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:01,360
 [LAUGHTER]

540
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:02,560
 So there we go.

541
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:05,120
 Did you see that Play Do a couple of years ago

542
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:07,520
 had to withdraw this--

543
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,400
 had to withdraw this product that it was releasing

544
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:12,400
 called the icing extruder after--

545
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,240
 Oh, god.

546
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:15,840
 --the complaints from parents that look like a penis.

547
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:18,040
 And it was extruding icing as well.

548
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:19,400
 It was extruding icing.

549
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:20,600
 It was to help them make cakes.

550
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:22,440
 So I think it was like a shaping tool.

551
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:25,320
 But if you look at it, it is a penis and testicles.

552
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:28,360
 And yeah, I think these reports said, unfortunately,

553
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:31,080
 it looks more like a sex toy, albeit a three-incher,

554
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:33,760
 than a child's toy, which is true.

555
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:37,720
 I think that's, surely, that's all in the mind of the parents

556
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:38,920
 who are dating them.

557
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:42,160
 And he's just showing us the Play Do picture on his computer now.

558
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:43,000
 Oh, no.

559
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:43,800
 Oh, yeah, so it is.

560
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:46,480
 I'm amazed that Safe Search is letting it through to be honest.

561
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:47,280
 But that's fine.

562
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,120
 When you see it actually--

563
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:49,600
 --lock on your own laptop.

564
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,760
 Of course.

565
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:53,840
 Every day, Andy's mom gives him his backlogs.

566
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:57,920
 But it's the parent lock on his computer sent him off to work.

567
00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:02,080
 Have you heard about the oldest penis ever discovered?

568
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:03,880
 It's not micro-brucky or sticky.

569
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:04,640
 Yes, sorry.

570
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:06,000
 That is the very, very oldest penis.

571
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,720
 This is the oldest man-made representation of a penis.

572
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:11,640
 Oh, OK, which is a physical object, not just a drawing.

573
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:16,680
 So it's 28,000 years old, which is amazing.

574
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:20,640
 And it was found at the Hall of Fells cave in Switzerland, which

575
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:23,080
 is a cave where they found lots and lots of really ancient stuff.

576
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:26,920
 And I just love this sentence about it.

577
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:29,280
 It might have been used either as a sex toy

578
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:32,080
 or to do flint napping, where you sharpen flints

579
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:33,720
 to use this tool.

580
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:36,360
 And the BBC report said, the tubing and team working

581
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:38,560
 Hall of Fells already had 13 fractured parts

582
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:39,960
 of the fallace in storage.

583
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:42,560
 But it was only with the discovery of a 14th fragment last year

584
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:45,480
 that the team was able finally to put the dicks all together.

585
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:47,920
 [LAUGHTER]

586
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:48,440
 What do they think?

587
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:51,000
 Well, they're making lots of shapes with it before that.

588
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,120
 Is it an elephant?

589
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:53,520
 Is it an airplane?

590
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:54,800
 Is it another penis?

591
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:58,040
 [LAUGHTER]

592
00:22:58,040 --> 00:23:00,760
 Well, so that's the oldest man-made penis.

593
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:03,080
 But the oldest graffiti penis, cock and balls

594
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:05,320
 that someone sketched out, the oldest known one,

595
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:08,200
 was discovered last year, is 2,500 years old.

596
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:11,760
 And it's in this a gene island called Astipalaya,

597
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:13,680
 or Astipalaya.

598
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:15,400
 And it was discovered when a Princeton professor

599
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:17,400
 was taking a bunch of archeology students there

600
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:20,600
 to show them the wonders of the island, the island's archeology.

601
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:23,560
 And they uncovered just hundreds of obscene pictures

602
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:24,920
 and obscene graffiti.

603
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:29,760
 So things like Nika Sittamos was here mounting tymiona

604
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:32,400
 and various bits of abuse against people.

605
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:35,000
 And yeah, the first picture of a cock and balls

606
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,160
 are very clear penis and two testicles.

607
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:41,120
 And the Princeton professor said, Dr. Blackopoulos,

608
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:43,680
 who found it, said, "What we have found

609
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:45,320
 is evidence that even then, people

610
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:48,000
 were using a coded language of symbols and imagery

611
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,840
 that was quite sophisticated."

612
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:51,320
 I mean, it's not the Davinci code, is it?

613
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:53,080
 [LAUGHTER]

614
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:54,320
 Should we track on them?

615
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:56,320
 Yeah, can I just mention this one last thing?

616
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:57,960
 I think this has been said on QI before,

617
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:01,040
 but I just really like it, which is the small penis rule.

618
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:02,480
 And I'd never heard of it before.

619
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:05,720
 And it's the idea that if you are in a novel trying

620
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:08,640
 a basic character of someone in real life,

621
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,440
 they can usually make an argument

622
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:12,800
 that you've used them as the inspiration they can sue you.

623
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:15,040
 So Michael Criton did this thing where he totally

624
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:16,840
 took down someone in real life in his book.

625
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:18,600
 But then he added this little extra detail,

626
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:21,240
 which was the character, has a small penis.

627
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:24,600
 And the guy wasn't able to sue him because he had to admit

628
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:27,120
 that he has a small penis if it was him.

629
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:28,280
 I would just do that.

630
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:30,840
 And I'd say, OK, fine, but whatever you want.

631
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:34,520
 I'm sure you can say he has drawn a malicious portrait of me,

632
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:36,400
 and then he has given him another characteristic.

633
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:39,040
 Yeah, I mean, you would think, but it turns out it worked.

634
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:41,000
 And it's now known as the small penis rule,

635
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,040
 which is something that gets you out of being libelous.

636
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:45,840
 Yeah, because you could say that, couldn't you?

637
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:47,800
 But it's whether or not people are going to believe it.

638
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:51,560
 Once they've seen the word small penis in a representation of you.

639
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:54,280
 I mean, no one's going to not say that that was a lie.

640
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:57,160
 I think also the idea is not that it will get thrown out of court.

641
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:58,480
 It's that you won't bring it to court.

642
00:24:58,480 --> 00:24:59,480
 You won't bring it to court.

643
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:02,040
 There'll be a whole cross-examination on the length of your--

644
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:05,920
 Yeah, like the Barbra Streisandix effect, which we discussed last time.

645
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:08,840
 That's where you just don't want to draw attention to this,

646
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:10,680
 because then it'll probably get into the papers.

647
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:11,200
 Yeah.

648
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:13,280
 It'll be very amusing for everyone, and then you'll feel--

649
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:15,840
 I read it the day about characters.

650
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:18,520
 This is a bit off topic, but you know Goldfinger.

651
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:19,520
 Mm-hmm.

652
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:21,560
 This was named after Erno Goldfinger,

653
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:24,560
 who's an architect who you try to tower and a few other things,

654
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:26,200
 elephant and castle and stuff.

655
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:30,720
 And he apparently was furious that Alexander Fleming--

656
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:33,160
 No, that Ian Fleming had.

657
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:34,400
 He was apparently furious that--

658
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:37,240
 Alexander Fleming had invented penicillin,

659
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:42,080
 which really made the plot more difficult to, yeah.

660
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:43,280
 Do you expect me to talk?

661
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:45,560
 No, Mr. Bond, I expect you to recover.

662
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:48,680
 [LAUGHTER]

663
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:50,480
 Anyway, no.

664
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:53,080
 So yeah, he was apparently furious that--

665
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:54,800
 let's just call him Fleming.

666
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:59,000
 He was furious that Fleming had used his name and threatened to sue.

667
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,200
 And the publishers sort of like paid him off

668
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,960
 and also said that they were going to put a thing at the start

669
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:05,920
 of the book saying it's not based on anyone,

670
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:07,480
 and it's just a coincidence, right?

671
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:08,920
 And they all agree to that.

672
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:11,240
 But Fleming wasn't very happy with that at all.

673
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:14,040
 And he was so unhappy that he went to his publishers

674
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:18,200
 and told them that he wanted to rename Goldfinger Goldpric.

675
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:20,920
 [LAUGHTER]

676
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:28,360
 OK, time for our final pack of the show.

677
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:31,000
 And that is Chazinski.

678
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,480
 My fact is that the man who inspired the main character

679
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:37,760
 in Jurassic Park is now building a chicken assaurus.

680
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:39,760
 Which character in Jurassic Park is the main character?

681
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:40,280
 The T-Rex.

682
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:41,800
 I would have said the T-Rex.

683
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:43,000
 [LAUGHTER]

684
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,280
 He wants a friend.

685
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:47,040
 No, this is Jack Horner, who is the pedientologist

686
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:48,800
 on whom Sam Neill's character is based.

687
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:49,280
 Oh, cool.

688
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:50,400
 And he's called in the film.

689
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,680
 But yet, he's a really famous pedientologist.

690
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:56,840
 And he is now building what he calls either a chicken assaurus,

691
00:26:56,840 --> 00:27:02,520
 or a dino chicken, which gives a general idea of what it is.

692
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:05,480
 How far has he got, if he's still on name, points right now?

693
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:07,880
 He's been rambling with that for a good decade or so.

694
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:09,520
 But no, he's got quite a long way.

695
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:12,240
 So it's about genetically back-engineering

696
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:15,520
 a chicken into being a dinosaur or into giving it

697
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:16,600
 dinosaur characteristics.

698
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:18,320
 And the three main things you need to change

699
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:20,520
 are the tails that you've got to give the chicken a tail.

700
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:23,080
 Because at the moment, chickens have this thing

701
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:25,320
 called a pigeon style, which is the thing that

702
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:27,480
 doesn't make their tail feathers move, but it's not a tail.

703
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:29,840
 So give them a tail, give them claws like a dinosaur instead

704
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:32,520
 of wings and give them a snout, not a beak.

705
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:33,040
 And they--

706
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:35,440
 And make them a hundred times bigger.

707
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:37,720
 You just blow into them for that, but it's true.

708
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:39,240
 OK.

709
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:41,640
 And yeah, they've done the beak, I think.

710
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:43,440
 So the tail's the hardest, apparently,

711
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:45,040
 getting a tail on the thing.

712
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:46,840
 I've seen a picture of what the beak would look like.

713
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:50,280
 It's pretty snout, rather than the beak, isn't it?

714
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:51,160
 Yeah, exactly.

715
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:51,680
 Yeah.

716
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:54,720
 Well, that's interesting, because birds had snouts

717
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,200
 for 50 million years.

718
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:58,640
 So the beak is a relatively recent innovation.

719
00:27:58,640 --> 00:27:59,400
 And is it better?

720
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:00,880
 I think they're all better in lots of ways.

721
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:01,400
 Yeah, yeah.

722
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:03,120
 It must be more suited to whatever environment.

723
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:03,640
 Yeah.

724
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:05,920
 Because if it feels like maybe it's getting into small holes

725
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:09,200
 and stuff, it would be rubbish with this snout.

726
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:11,520
 It just bruises nose constantly.

727
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:12,800
 It seems with dinosaurs.

728
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:15,560
 So they're now saying that they had feathers.

729
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:16,800
 That's a theory coming up.

730
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:18,800
 I read on the other day that the Diplodocus,

731
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:21,320
 we all have this impression that the long necks

732
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:24,920
 is that they go out on a sort of 45 degree angle.

733
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:26,200
 But actually, they were right up.

734
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:27,160
 That's the new theory.

735
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:29,360
 Yeah, the new theories are going to be right vertically up.

736
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:30,120
 Like a giraffe.

737
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:30,960
 Yeah, it was--

738
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,680
 So they thought they were supposed to balance each other,

739
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:34,760
 because it was like the tail going out one way

740
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:35,960
 and the neck going out the other way and stuff.

741
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:37,520
 I think the tail goes right up as well.

742
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:38,800
 Yeah, that's right.

743
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:42,360
 That's just what it's trying to get for a really tight leg.

744
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:47,160
 Or the goalposts, or American football.

745
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:49,120
 Do we know what kind of dinosaurs would have had feathers,

746
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:50,760
 or is the prevailing theory that all of them had feathers?

747
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:52,280
 Well, I think T-Rexes are saying--

748
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:53,280
 Yeah.

749
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:54,280
 T-Rexes have feathers.

750
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:55,800
 And they may not have had penises.

751
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:57,720
 Any of them to take it back to penises.

752
00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:00,120
 I think that's something that we're confident about, isn't it?

753
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:00,720
 Well, no, no.

754
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:03,880
 I mean, we don't know that any dinosaurs had penises.

755
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:05,840
 And actually, we're not sure with a lot of them

756
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:08,160
 how mechanically they had sex.

757
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,360
 One of the things in looking to this,

758
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:11,600
 because Jack Horner's has a number of dinosaurs

759
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:12,560
 named after him.

760
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:13,080
 I--

761
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:14,080
 Holosaurus.

762
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:15,080
 Yeah, maybe.

763
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:15,600
 I don't know.

764
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:18,120
 Actually, do you have the names on you by any chance?

765
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:19,200
 Terichaptal.

766
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:21,200
 Oh.

767
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:23,000
 Terichaptal.

768
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,040
 I thought I knew all the dinosaurs.

769
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:26,840
 I thought they were like the classic.

770
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:28,040
 I thought I knew them all.

771
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:30,320
 Is this like when you thought you knew all the Roman numerals?

772
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:33,440
 [LAUGHTER]

773
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:35,880
 It turns out there's so many dinosaurs out there

774
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:39,520
 that celebrities have dinosaurs named after them.

775
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:40,800
 That's how many there are.

776
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:43,040
 Like, Attenborough has a dinosaur named after him.

777
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:44,840
 Attenborough-Saurus.

778
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:45,360
 Nice.

779
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:47,800
 There's also Mark Knoffler from Dyer Straits.

780
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:49,800
 The reason it's named after him is that when they were digging

781
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:52,800
 in this quarry, they seemed to find this new species

782
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:55,960
 anytime Dyer Straits was pumping out over the sound system.

783
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:57,880
 So they were just like, get Dyer Straits back on

784
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:58,800
 and they kept finding more.

785
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:00,280
 So they gave that species to him.

786
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:04,200
 And there's also an Elvis one called the Elvisaurus.

787
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:07,400
 And it was the first dinosaur to be discovered in Antarctica,

788
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:08,560
 which Elvis loved.

789
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:11,240
 You know, where Elvis spent a lot of time as a boy.

790
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:12,480
 Where Elvis now lives.

791
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:15,080
 [LAUGHTER]

792
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:17,320
 I found out really cool thing about chickens this week,

793
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:20,760
 which is that we have just found a new state of matter

794
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:23,200
 in the eyeball of a chicken.

795
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:24,200
 How cool is that?

796
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:25,760
 I thought I knew all the states of matter.

797
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:27,240
 Not anymore, James.

798
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:30,280
 Yeah, no, you're pulling into my trap there.

799
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:32,240
 Yeah, so there were a few states of matter

800
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:33,600
 aside from the standard for.

801
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:37,000
 And this one is called disordered hyperuniformity,

802
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:37,800
 which is kind of cool.

803
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:39,800
 And it's an arrangement of molecules, which is really chaotic,

804
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:40,800
 if you look at it close up.

805
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:43,760
 And then over large spaces, it's got a kind of uniformity.

806
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:45,080
 And it's apparently acts somewhere

807
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:46,920
 between a liquid and a crystal, I think.

808
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:48,800
 But yeah, it just rocked up in the eye of a chicken

809
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:49,840
 as they were studying it.

810
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:50,480
 That's cool.

811
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:53,440
 That's like when we have filums.

812
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:55,920
 So every animal fits into a phylum.

813
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:58,840
 And they found a whole new phylum.

814
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:00,520
 And it was on the lobster's lip.

815
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:02,880
 And it was just this total new type of life

816
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:04,120
 that they'd not seen before.

817
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:05,400
 How did they notice that?

818
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:05,800
 I don't know.

819
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:06,960
 How did they notice the chicken eye?

820
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:07,480
 Yeah.

821
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:09,800
 Oh, this doesn't look like a state of matter I've

822
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:10,920
 seen anyone's eye before.

823
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:12,880
 Yeah, like how would you even begin to do that?

824
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:14,440
 So the industrial farming of chickens

825
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:17,280
 was kind of a mistake the way it started.

826
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:17,760
 Oh, yeah.

827
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:18,760
 Yeah.

828
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:19,680
 Explain.

829
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:22,720
 Well, before 1923, when Hensel raised for meat,

830
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:27,120
 there were more or less a byproduct of egg laying birds.

831
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:29,560
 The end of an egg laying bird's life,

832
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:31,720
 it would be killed for meat.

833
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:33,440
 But there wasn't quite the same tradition

834
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:35,920
 of raising lots and lots and lots of birds.

835
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:38,440
 So traditional farming favored birds, which

836
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:40,280
 were good for eggs and for meat, basically.

837
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:42,640
 And then in 1923, a woman from Delaware

838
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:45,680
 called Mrs. Cecil Steele, just blazing,

839
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:49,040
 she accidentally ordered far too many birds.

840
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:51,120
 She meant all of 50 and she got 500.

841
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:53,400
 Was it like when you're doing your online shopping

842
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:55,080
 and she accidentally bought a thousand of them?

843
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:57,080
 Yeah, exactly.

844
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:58,080
 And so she sold them.

845
00:31:58,080 --> 00:31:59,520
 And then the next year, she produced 1,000.

846
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:01,960
 And her neighbors started catching on thinking, oh, wait.

847
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:02,680
 This is really good.

848
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:05,240
 And there's more of a market for this than we thought there was.

849
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:06,840
 So people like chicken.

850
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:10,200
 Yeah, in 1925, Delaware farmers made 50,000 birds.

851
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:11,080
 They grew 50,000 birds.

852
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:13,520
 In 1929, it was 3 million.

853
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:14,040
 Wow.

854
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:15,440
 And in the election, Herbert Hoover,

855
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:17,280
 he promised a chicken in every pot.

856
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:20,640
 And that was the kind of start of this incredible expansion

857
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:22,080
 of battery farming.

858
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:23,280
 When people used to cook chickens,

859
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:26,120
 they used to want to make them sing for some reason.

860
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:27,960
 Or when it's just come out the oven,

861
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:29,480
 they used to want to make it sing.

862
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:33,360
 And what they used to do is put mercury inside the chicken

863
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:35,080
 and then kind of sew it up.

864
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:38,760
 And then that would kind of expand and make air inside the chicken.

865
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:40,880
 And then they make a tiny hole, I think.

866
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:42,480
 And then it would kind of tweet.

867
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:44,720
 Wow, that's so clever.

868
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:45,520
 It's amazing.

869
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:47,800
 It's clever, apart from the fact that it's highly close.

870
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:49,560
 Yeah, you're a dinner.

871
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:50,640
 It's worth it, though, for that.

872
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:55,280
 So it's like taking it out and the chicken going, tada!

873
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:58,200
 Not everyone is happy with the chicken asaurus idea

874
00:32:58,200 --> 00:32:59,960
 of making a chicken asaurus.

875
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:04,880
 So one of the colleagues of Dr. Horner has said this.

876
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:06,000
 It was in BBC report.

877
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,080
 Has he said, get back in your corner, Jack.

878
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:09,680
 No, he hasn't.

879
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:10,680
 He should have done.

880
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:11,680
 He should have.

881
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:13,240
 Can I say he gets that a lot?

882
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:16,160
 He said, technically, you're going to have a messed up chicken.

883
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:16,960
 It's not a dinosaur.

884
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:18,280
 It's never going to be a dinosaur.

885
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:20,560
 It's just going to be a really awful monstrosity.

886
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:21,720
 I would agree with that, actually.

887
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:23,720
 I think what you're making is not a dinosaur.

888
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:26,400
 You're making a chicken with dinosaur characteristics, right?

889
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:29,520
 But if all the genes survive somewhere,

890
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:30,640
 I find that really interesting.

891
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:32,520
 So the idea is that chickens somewhere

892
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:36,080
 will have DNA that was inside dinosaurs, right?

893
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:38,080
 Well, some of it will be inactive or some of it

894
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:40,480
 would have been thrown away or just evolved away over it.

895
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:42,680
 What is true is that the chicken that you had for dinner

896
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:44,720
 yesterday, its parents were chicken.

897
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:46,920
 That chicken's parents were chicken, and they were chicken,

898
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:48,560
 and they were chicken, and they were chicken.

899
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:50,160
 And then if you got far enough, their parents

900
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:51,360
 would have been a dinosaur.

901
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:52,440
 I think that's so cool.

902
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:54,680
 I think one of the main things is, say, for instance,

903
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:55,880
 a tail.

904
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:57,400
 A chicken embryo has a tail.

905
00:33:57,400 --> 00:34:00,400
 But then it kind of gets reabsorbed back into the embryo.

906
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:02,040
 And there's a gene that does that.

907
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:04,800
 If you can turn that gene off, then tail will continue

908
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:07,000
 to grow, and then you'll have a chicken with a tail.

909
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,080
 And actually human embryos also have tails.

910
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:09,920
 So, really?

911
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:11,560
 Yeah, we reabsorbed them as well.

912
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:14,160
 Theoretically, if you could find the gene in humans

913
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:16,960
 and turn that off, then you could have humans with tails.

914
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:19,640
 Would it be a hairy tail, like a monkey's tail?

915
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:21,240
 But Sharon, I would say it must be.

916
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:22,880
 I know, because it would be, but then again--

917
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:24,440
 Because it hasn't evolved with the rest of us.

918
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:25,320
 Yeah, we've been on hairy.

919
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:28,040
 Humans aren't hairy all over like that.

920
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:28,960
 By them.

921
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:31,240
 [LAUGHTER]

922
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:33,400
 They think, getting the tail reabsorption

923
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:36,640
 gene to stop turning off is something they think they might

924
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:40,400
 crack, because they've worked out how to turn on a gecko's tail

925
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:41,400
 reabsorption.

926
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:44,600
 So, scientists have learned how to make a gecko embryo

927
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:45,960
 reabsorb its own tail.

928
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:46,960
 This is so exciting.

929
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:47,480
 Yeah.

930
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:49,520
 I think in the future, when you're having a baby,

931
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:53,120
 you'll be able to tick all the boxes for you to tail.

932
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:57,080
 Will it be, will it be, will it be, pushed, clipped?

933
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:57,600
 It's fraggly.

934
00:34:57,600 --> 00:35:01,320
 OK, that's it.

935
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:02,240
 That's all of our facts.

936
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:03,480
