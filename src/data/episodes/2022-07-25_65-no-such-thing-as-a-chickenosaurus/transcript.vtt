00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.580
 This is how it works.

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:18.260
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:21.240
 coming to you from the QI offices in Covent Garden.

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:22.240
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:27.180
 I'm sitting here with Andy Murray, James Harkin, and Anna Chazinski, and once again we have

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.020
 gathered around the microphone with our four favorite facts from the last seven days,

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:35.580
 and in a particular order, here we go, starting with Andy.

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:39.940
 My fact is that fish who work as cleaners can cheat their bosses and their bosses can

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:43.060
 punish them.

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:45.180
 So this is incredible.

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.580
 There are fish, as I'm sure you know, who clean other fish, as in they eat parasites

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:50.580
 from the skin.

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:54.540
 So you get cleaner fish and client fish is what they're technically known as.

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:58.520
 And there have been lots of studies of this, especially by this amazing sounding ecologist

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:03.680
 called Reduane Bacheri, I hope I'm pronouncing his name right, who has studied these guys

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:04.680
 so much.

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.960
 And basically, the trade is for food versus clean skin, but the cleaner fish they sometimes

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.120
 cheat because they actually like eating the thick mucus that covers the client fish as

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:19.280
 a protective layer, and they often have a cheeky bite of it instead of eating a parasite.

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:22.560
 And that makes the client fish jump, I guess, in pain.

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.920
 So that's them cheating it and then their bosses, the client fish punish them by chasing

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.680
 them around.

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:32.080
 And the cleaner fish which have been chased around, they behave better in future.

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:35.040
 They stop misbehaving as much when they've been chased about.

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.680
 What are they threatening to do when they chase them around?

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:41.720
 Because in the end, they want to be making contact with, it's like being chased around

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:42.920
 by someone you really fancy.

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:50.080
 It's like being chased by your boss, you know, because they're often bigger fish or

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:51.080
 they're often predatory.

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:54.060
 Being chased by your boss.

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.240
 Secretive QI experts.

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:01.680
 So yeah, if there are lots of client fish, then the cleaners have the upper hand because

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:02.880
 they're more in demand.

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.680
 And so they try and take more bites of mucus because they know that they've got a captive

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:07.680
 market.

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:08.680
 Right?

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:09.680
 Yeah.

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:10.680
 Because the client fish have to get clean somewhere.

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:11.680
 Yeah.

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:12.680
 Genius.

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.760
 So they propagate the problem in order that they can solve it, which is kind of exactly

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.360
 what a lot of human industry does, right?

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:20.640
 I guess so, yeah, how do they propagate the problem?

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.520
 Are they making it worse?

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:24.040
 They're tricking the...

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:25.040
 Not really.

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.440
 No, because they're not luring the number of client fish available.

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:28.440
 Okay.

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:29.440
 You know what I mean?

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:30.440
 But client fish...

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:33.720
 No, actually, they're sort of up because client fish remove their customer if they get

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:36.040
 bad service.

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:40.520
 And they kind of keep going back to the same species or the same fish that they really

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:42.280
 like and have good service from, don't they?

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:43.280
 Yeah.

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:44.280
 Really?

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:45.280
 Yeah.

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:46.280
 Okay, that's really cool.

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:49.000
 Huge service stations, so there are hundreds of them or something.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.000
 Yeah, they have...

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.200
 They're all over the ocean, especially on reefs, that's whether you get them.

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:54.200
 There are these...

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:56.200
 Just a big welcome break of cleaners, yeah.

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:57.200
 Basically...

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:58.200
 A big shell.

00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:59.200
 Yeah.

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:00.200
 (laughter)

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:01.200
 Cool.

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:06.360
 Yeah, a single cleaner fish inspects more than two hundred two thousand three hundred

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:07.360
 fish a day.

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:08.360
 Wow.

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:10.040
 And it eats about twelve hundred parasites.

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:12.240
 That's an impressive rate of work.

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:17.800
 And some client fish had themselves cleaned every five minutes.

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:18.800
 So vain.

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:19.800
 Celebrity client fish.

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:20.800
 Yeah.

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:22.920
 So this isn't quite a recent discovery, right?

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:23.920
 Yeah, yeah.

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:24.920
 This is a scuba diver who is...

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:25.920
 Yeah.

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:30.440
 Which is really cool because it just makes me wonder, what are the mysteries of fish, you

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:31.440
 know?

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:32.440
 There's so many things that we don't...

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:33.440
 Like, I was reading as well.

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:34.440
 There's a...

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:37.360
 I can't remember what the fish is called now, but it's a fish that basically sun bathes.

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:40.000
 It goes to the surface of the water and it just lays it for half the day.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.520
 They've had no idea why it does that until recently they just put a camera on it and worked

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:46.480
 out that it was going really deep and it was...

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:50.760
 And it was finding all these other little things to eat and the coldness meant that it needed

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:54.520
 to get up there to get the heat back down, like just to regulate their body temperature.

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:55.520
 Yeah.

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:56.520
 But they didn't know that up until recently.

00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:00.080
 So we've just had floating sunbathing fish up until a year or so ago.

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:03.680
 Well, so they're just warming themselves up so that they can conserve heat to go back down

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:04.680
 to the cold water.

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:06.680
 I think they're called sunfish.

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:07.680
 Yes, sunfish.

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:10.440
 It's a cool thing. They get cleaned themselves by albatrosses.

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:11.440
 No!

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:12.440
 No!

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:13.440
 That doesn't sound like cleaning.

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:15.440
 That sounds like the albatross is trying to eat them.

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:16.440
 No!

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:17.440
 It doesn't quite get to go.

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:18.440
 No, because they're huge.

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:22.440
 It's what the biggest ever found weighed 2.3 Tarras, they're massive.

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:23.440
 Oh, yeah, they're massive.

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:26.520
 And when they get infested with these parasites, which obviously they suck their blood and

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:30.800
 they're horrible, albatrosses land nearby as they sunbathe and pick the parasites off

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:31.800
 them.

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:32.800
 Wow.

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:33.800
 Isn't that incredible?

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:34.800
 Yeah, that's pretty cool.

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:38.600
 It's kind of for some reason, it reminds me of humpback whales, get parasites on them.

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:39.600
 Don't they?

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:40.600
 They get lice on them.

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:44.520
 And that's when you see a whale breaching and then like jumping out of the water and then

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:47.920
 splashing back down again, it's often trying to dislodge the parasites.

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:51.640
 Is that the equivalent of a dog dragging itself along the ground?

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:55.520
 But it's slightly more romantic than that, yeah.

00:04:55.520 --> 00:05:00.320
 Because you don't get couples going on special holidays to watch dogs dragging themselves

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:02.120
 along the ground.

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:05.680
 I don't know if I've seen that.

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:08.000
 Do you have a sick dog?

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:19.520
 No, I've never seen it in real life, but I've seen it in cartoons and stuff.

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:21.560
 I've seen it in cartoons and stuff.

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:25.760
 Tom and Jerry's changed, isn't it?

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:30.560
 So this is another parasite, so Oxpeckas have a similar relationship to things like rhinos

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:31.560
 and buffaloes.

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:32.560
 What's Oxpeckas?

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:33.920
 It's a kind of bird.

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:34.920
 So an Oxpeck.

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:35.920
 Oxes.

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:36.920
 It sure does.

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:37.920
 Ah.

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:40.480
 It packs Oxen and Zebra's and rhinos.

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:42.320
 It's a fitting name.

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:45.400
 And so it sits on them and it eats ticks and parasites that live on them.

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:50.160
 But they also trick their hosts because they obviously, they've got a vested interest in

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:53.960
 getting more ticks and parasites to come and, you know, land on these animals.

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:57.760
 And so they exacerbate their wounds or if they've got a bit of blood, bloodied wound

00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:00.520
 exposed, then the Oxpeckas will come and peck it, make it a bit worse.

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:04.640
 To make sure that more parasites come and then they can eat the parasites.

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:05.640
 Really?

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:10.160
 It's like a cleaner who makes your house more dirty.

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:12.160
 Just so more cleaners come.

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:14.800
 I think I'm going to need to hire another cleaner.

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:15.800
 Fuck you.

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:17.560
 You've just got hundreds of cleaners here.

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:20.600
 I'm a dirty, dirty, dirty house.

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:21.600
 Yeah.

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:25.120
 So there is, there are really cool photos on the mail of, there's a 13-year-old who went

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:28.440
 snorkeling in Indonesia and he persuaded a shrimp to clean his teeth.

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:29.440
 Wow.

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:30.440
 Yeah.

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:31.440
 He saved persuades.

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:32.440
 Come on.

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:33.440
 Yeah.

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:34.440
 Come on.

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:35.440
 I'm not going to tell anyone.

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:36.440
 He's probably going to enjoy it.

00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:38.400
 He snorkeled down to whether it, because he's, he found a cleaning station.

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:42.360
 One of these garages, basically, where they, they, and they, they, there it's not fish.

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:43.360
 It's shrimp.

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:45.400
 It just happens to be owned and operated by shrimp.

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:49.400
 And, um, he opened his mouth and it went into his mouth and it removed bits of food from

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:50.400
 between his teeth.

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:51.400
 Wow.

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:52.400
 Yeah, I've seen that.

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:53.400
 It's pretty gross.

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:54.400
 Unbelievable.

00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:55.400
 Cool.

00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:56.400
 I'll put up pictures of it on Twitter.

00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:57.400
 If you've just been eating shrimp, though, that wouldn't be very nice.

00:06:57.400 --> 00:06:58.400
 Oh my god.

00:06:58.400 --> 00:06:59.400
 That's true.

00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:00.400
 That's a good boy.

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:01.400
 Jeff?

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:02.400
 Okay.

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:05.400
 That's like having a car made of mechanics.

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:13.440
 Um, quite an expensive dental treatment, I think, flying to Bali every time you clean your

00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:14.440
 teeth.

00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:15.440
 A toothpick.

00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:16.440
 We'll do the job.

00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:19.000
 Um, but they're, they're also, they're a mimic fish.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.000
 So clean a fish have a bright blue stripe along them often or really, they're really brightly

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.160
 coming to, kind of, to advertise themselves and say, hey, look, I'm here on bright and

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:26.520
 I'm, I'm happy to clean your teeth.

00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:28.240
 Um, or eat the parasites or whatever.

00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:32.040
 But they're a mimic fish, which have evolved the same kind of stripe, hang around near

00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:36.400
 cleaner fish and just go around taking chunks out of just eating the mucus only.

00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:37.400
 Yeah, eating the mucus only.

00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:38.400
 Exactly.

00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:42.400
 And that, that damage is trade because it makes fish at the station more nervy.

00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:46.880
 And these stations, they're like, um, um, what's a good, they're like neutral territory

00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:47.880
 in the ocean.

00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:51.800
 So you get even sharks turning up to have the parasites cleaned up and they don't eat fish

00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:56.880
 that they would normally be hunting and killing and eating because it's kind of safe,

00:07:56.880 --> 00:07:58.320
 it's a safe zone for all fish.

00:07:58.320 --> 00:07:59.320
 Okay.

00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:04.240
 So if you fall out of the boat in the middle of the ocean, what you need to do is find one

00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:08.720
 of these areas and then no sharks will eat you because you're safe and then you're, you're

00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:09.720
 in the neutral zone.

00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:10.720
 Exactly.

00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:11.720
 Yeah.

00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:12.720
 And you get a good floss.

00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:13.720
 Mine is out there.

00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:20.560
 Um, my favourite mutualism, like mutualistic relationship underwater is actually shrimp based.

00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:25.040
 It's, uh, the relationship between shrimps and goby fish who's in this, so shrimps and goby

00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:29.520
 fish have this really sweet relationship where the goby fish gets the shrimp to build its,

00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:33.400
 so the goby fish lives in, um, little dugouts in the sand at the bottom of the ocean.

00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:36.360
 And it gets, employs the shrimp to build its little dugout.

00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:41.200
 Um, and then it keeps the shrimp on as a permanent cleaner to clean its house.

00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:45.840
 So they've lived together in this house and the goby shrimp is employing, the goby fish

00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:48.240
 is employing the shrimp to clean his house and to build it.

00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:49.240
 But what are you paying for?

00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:53.200
 And in exchange, the, because the shrimp doesn't have very good eyesight, so can't really

00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:57.000
 spot when predators are coming, so the goby fish sits at the top of the borough and looks

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:01.120
 out for predators and they're always in contact, so the goby fish always has a little fin touching

00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:02.120
 the shrimp.

00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:05.060
 And if there's a predator who, like, wave his fin at the shrimp, it'll be like, go back in

00:09:05.060 --> 00:09:06.060
 the hole.

00:09:06.060 --> 00:09:08.560
 Sounds like a great sitcom, doesn't it?

00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:09.560
 Yeah.

00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:14.640
 But also, the, the other shark or fish, whatever, must know that the goby is hiding, you're going

00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:15.640
 to shrimp at home today?

00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:16.640
 Oh, no.

00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:17.640
 No, tired him.

00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:18.640
 He was, he wasn't doing a good job, but...

00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:21.640
 Was that what you hold it on to down there?

00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:22.640
 I don't know.

00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:24.760
 So, me or Finn, the other one.

00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:25.760
 Yeah.

00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:32.040
 So, some of these cleaner fish, if they eat too much, if you're a female cleaner fish, if

00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:35.840
 you eat too much, you turn into a male, so you get bigger and bigger and you turn into

00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:36.840
 a male.

00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:37.840
 Right?

00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:40.080
 It's, I don't quite know how that works, but it does work.

00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:45.040
 And apparently there's some very new research that says that male cleaner fish will aggressively

00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:48.440
 nudge their mates to watch their diet.

00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:54.160
 So, if they're eating too much, because I like, stop it, you'll turn into a male.

00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:58.220
 That is so good.

00:09:58.220 --> 00:10:01.680
 Okay, time for fact number two.

00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:06.720
 My fact this week is that al-Qaeda's job application form includes a question asking who

00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:10.920
 should be contacted in the event that the applicant becomes a martyr.

00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:14.360
 Now, I have a lot of questions about that.

00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:15.360
 Yeah.

00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:16.960
 There's, where is the job application form available?

00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:21.360
 Okay, so they found this as a part of, basically, when they raided Bin Laden's house and when

00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:24.520
 Bin Laden was taken down, they took all the stuff from his house.

00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:29.120
 He was applying for a job, so now all you have to do is go to Bin Laden's house and then

00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:30.360
 pick up a form there.

00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:31.720
 It's very easy.

00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:36.920
 But so they, they found a lot of books, they found a lot of papers, obviously, and the government

00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:40.360
 hadn't released it for a long time, and it's just been released, and part of the papers

00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:43.400
 that were found in his house was the al-Qaeda job applicant form.

00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:46.920
 There are lots of questions like, what objectives would you like to accomplish on

00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:47.920
 your G-head path?

00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:56.360
 I guess they don't ask, where will you be in the next five years?

00:10:56.360 --> 00:10:58.240
 And hobbies, they want to know hobbies?

00:10:58.240 --> 00:10:59.240
 Really?

00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:00.240
 Yeah.

00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:01.240
 Hobbies and pastimes is another question.

00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:03.800
 Do you know that Bin Laden was a really good volleyball player?

00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:04.800
 No, do.

00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:05.800
 Is he?

00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:06.800
 Yeah, he was.

00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:11.840
 Whenever they used to have volleyball competitions in al-Qaeda, he and Mohammed Atef had to

00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:15.360
 be on different teams because they were both by far the best players.

00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:16.360
 Wow.

00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:17.360
 He taught, wasn't he?

00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:18.360
 Yeah, he was.

00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:21.760
 But was he really good in the way that we've often said Kim Jong-un is great at golf?

00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:25.720
 You know, like, were people just letting him win every shot, kind of thing?

00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:26.720
 Maybe.

00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:27.720
 I wanted to.

00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:28.720
 I thought he was on dialysis.

00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:31.920
 This might have been earlier before the dialysis.

00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:32.920
 Okay.

00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:34.920
 Because a lot of the best volleyball players are not on dialysis.

00:11:34.920 --> 00:11:35.920
 It's true.

00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:36.920
 That's a good fact.

00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:40.200
 It's possibly Nintendo Wii that he was on volleyball on as well.

00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:42.640
 I suppose if you have to stay indoors all the time.

00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:43.640
 Exactly.

00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:47.320
 Well, was he found with some kind of games console or no, he had loads of DVDs.

00:11:47.320 --> 00:11:48.320
 Lots of DVDs.

00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:49.320
 Lots of pornography.

00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:50.320
 Lots of pornography.

00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:51.320
 No.

00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:52.320
 Yeah, they've not released the titles.

00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:53.320
 But they said that had he had a big.

00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:54.320
 Yeah.

00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:55.320
 No, I don't know what.

00:11:55.320 --> 00:11:56.320
 Tell me.

00:11:56.320 --> 00:11:57.320
 Yeah, yeah.

00:11:57.320 --> 00:11:59.320
 Because they've said that he had a lot of books and they released the titles of the books

00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:03.920
 that he had, which included known Chomsky books and really oddly conspiracy theory books

00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:05.840
 about 9/11, which is really interesting.

00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:06.840
 Oh, really?

00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:07.840
 Yeah, yeah.

00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:08.840
 He had a lot of them.

00:12:08.840 --> 00:12:09.840
 And a huge stash of pornography.

00:12:09.840 --> 00:12:11.960
 They've not told us what they are.

00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:17.520
 One thing that said though is that apparently extremists often have pornography as a way

00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:18.520
 of communicating.

00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:19.520
 So they'll have coded messages within a--

00:12:19.520 --> 00:12:20.520
 Oh, yeah, that is true.

00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:21.520
 Yeah.

00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:27.120
 Stagnography, it's called, which is when you put messages in pictures and terrorists usually

00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:28.120
 use pornography.

00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:34.200
 Well, so they set up a porn shoot in order that they can plant a message into the scene somewhere.

00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:37.640
 I think they use existing photos.

00:12:37.640 --> 00:12:45.840
 That is the most convoluted excuse for seeing naked women-- I'm looking for a message.

00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:47.920
 To look really closely at this one, I'm afraid.

00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:48.920
 Probably for hours.

00:12:48.920 --> 00:12:53.240
 I'm probably going to take it with me, actually, guys.

00:12:53.240 --> 00:12:57.760
 I'd like to thank you for this fact, Dan, because now in the course of researching application

00:12:57.760 --> 00:13:05.920
 forms for terrorism, I have, in my Google record, the phrase "apply to join ISIS."

00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:11.760
 And as I speak on the UN terror watch list, you probably are.

00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:12.760
 That's a way to think that--

00:13:12.760 --> 00:13:13.760
 Yeah.

00:13:13.760 --> 00:13:14.760
 We'll have alerted some time and some time.

00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:17.160
 I've been in it five minutes ago, and now that's never leaving me.

00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:21.560
 Isn't there a, like, a removals company in the UK called ISIS, or used to be called

00:13:21.560 --> 00:13:22.560
 ISIS?

00:13:22.560 --> 00:13:23.560
 And then they had to change their name.

00:13:23.560 --> 00:13:24.840
 Or is a building company awesome?

00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:26.760
 There are lots of-- there are lots of firms, actually.

00:13:26.760 --> 00:13:30.720
 So there's-- and someers, they were bringing out a line called ISIS.

00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:32.640
 I think we've mentioned this on the podcast before.

00:13:32.640 --> 00:13:36.320
 And they said, well, it's too late to change it now.

00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:39.480
 We've been working on this for six months.

00:13:39.480 --> 00:13:44.360
 The best one was about that is the people who had a 21st birthday party.

00:13:44.360 --> 00:13:45.360
 Do you remember that?

00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:46.360
 No.

00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:47.360
 So it's a 21st birthday party.

00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:50.560
 They had two balloons that said 21st or 2 in a 1.

00:13:50.560 --> 00:13:53.480
 But from the other side of the room, it looked like ISIS.

00:13:53.480 --> 00:13:55.520
 So from outside, it looked like ISIS.

00:13:55.520 --> 00:13:58.320
 And people called the police and said, we think there's a--

00:13:58.320 --> 00:13:59.320
 You know, I know.

00:13:59.320 --> 00:14:00.320
 Like, as if they--

00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:01.320
 That's birthday party.

00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:03.320
 That is, if they'd advertise where they were with--

00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:05.320
 I don't know if they have ISIS balloons.

00:14:05.320 --> 00:14:08.600
 They don't seem like the kind of party balloon sort of guys.

00:14:08.600 --> 00:14:10.200
 I was an Oxford a few weeks ago.

00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:13.640
 And there was an NHS sort of small building that

00:14:13.640 --> 00:14:16.200
 was called ISIS out on the front of it as well.

00:14:16.200 --> 00:14:18.600
 And right next to the sign ISIS, there was another sign

00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:21.960
 that they put outside in paper that said, please do not

00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:23.920
 lean your bicycle against our wall.

00:14:23.920 --> 00:14:26.640
 And you're like, I am definitely not going to lean on it.

00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:28.760
 No bicycles on that wall.

00:14:28.760 --> 00:14:30.600
 It's fantastic.

00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:33.200
 You know the question that you get asked on forms

00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:34.720
 so the US visa form.

00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:36.360
 I mean, there's some very, very way questions.

00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:40.400
 Like, are you coming to the US to engage in prostitution?

00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:42.840
 Do you belong to a clan or tribe?

00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:45.960
 And have you ever been responsible for quotes, particularly

00:14:45.960 --> 00:14:48.480
 severe violations of religious freedom?

00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:52.480
 So presumably trivial violations of religious freedom

00:14:52.480 --> 00:14:53.000
 are OK.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:54.800
 But do you know the reason they do this?

00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:56.040
 No, you have to answer all these.

00:14:56.040 --> 00:15:00.520
 Is it because then if you answer it and you lie,

00:15:00.520 --> 00:15:02.440
 then they can kick you out because you've lie done a fart.

00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:03.280
 Yes.

00:15:03.280 --> 00:15:06.560
 So that they have a reason to say you've

00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:08.880
 obtained a visa by fraud or misrepresentation.

00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:10.360
 And that in itself is enough of a reason

00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:11.440
 to ask you to leave the country.

00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:12.440
 So that's why they do it.

00:15:12.440 --> 00:15:14.760
 Did you see the Mexican visa application one?

00:15:14.760 --> 00:15:15.520
 No, no.

00:15:15.520 --> 00:15:16.920
 So this is one of the questions on it.

00:15:16.920 --> 00:15:20.360
 Since been taken off, describe your mustache slash beard.

00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:25.440
 That can not be true.

00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:26.960
 That's the number of people are written.

00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:29.920
 This was in either the independent or the telegraph.

00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:32.720
 They did a survey of questions you've

00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:33.960
 been asked on a visa form.

00:15:33.960 --> 00:15:35.600
 Did you check the data on that?

00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:37.160
 Because that does sound very--

00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:38.960
 I was suspect it was one respondent.

00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:41.880
 And he said the options were scant, bushy, or clipped.

00:15:41.880 --> 00:15:47.960
 I have to say, I wasn't going to read this out either.

00:15:47.960 --> 00:15:50.000
 It's too much of a risk.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:51.520
 Hey, one guy claimed it.

00:15:51.520 --> 00:15:52.200
 I believe it.

00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:55.960
 Did you see that job application in The Alps of Silly,

00:15:55.960 --> 00:15:58.280
 which was for an air traffic controller?

00:15:58.280 --> 00:16:00.240
 And it was in Braille.

00:16:00.240 --> 00:16:01.320
 Oh, really?

00:16:01.320 --> 00:16:02.360
 Yeah.

00:16:02.360 --> 00:16:04.800
 And they were like, well, all of our job applications

00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:08.040
 have to come in all the different in Braille, as well as in--

00:16:08.040 --> 00:16:08.560
 Yeah, yeah.

00:16:08.560 --> 00:16:09.760
 I'm writing, so.

00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:10.680
 Scary stuff.

00:16:10.680 --> 00:16:11.560
 That was it, isn't it?

00:16:11.560 --> 00:16:12.400
 Yeah.

00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:14.960
 In Russia, to get your dry cleaning done,

00:16:14.960 --> 00:16:18.640
 you have to sign your signature five times,

00:16:18.640 --> 00:16:20.520
 and feel it in a larger number of forms.

00:16:20.520 --> 00:16:22.000
 There's a really good essay on the Guardian website

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.560
 about Bureaucracy in Russia.

00:16:24.560 --> 00:16:30.040
 And how lots of Soviet Bureaucracy has basically survived.

00:16:30.040 --> 00:16:30.520
 OK.

00:16:30.520 --> 00:16:34.320
 That doesn't sound like it would be true in all dry cleaners.

00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:37.720
 Maybe it isn't, especially bureaucratic dry cleaning.

00:16:37.720 --> 00:16:38.760
 Is it just one form?

00:16:38.760 --> 00:16:41.480
 And there's five signature lines at the bottom.

00:16:41.480 --> 00:16:43.720
 Sounds like dry cleaners is a euphemism for something,

00:16:43.720 --> 00:16:47.200
 like cleaning the streets of London of bit treacherous.

00:16:47.200 --> 00:16:51.120
 I was at a hotel once, and the person reception asked me

00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:54.520
 for my two signatures, and I said, I've only got one.

00:16:54.520 --> 00:16:57.360
 And I think it's the funniest thing I've ever said in my life.

00:16:57.360 --> 00:16:58.040
 She didn't even--

00:16:58.040 --> 00:16:59.120
 I've heard that if you're funny yet.

00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:11.640
 OK, time for fact number three, and that is James.

00:17:11.640 --> 00:17:15.520
 OK, my fact this week is that the single biggest expense

00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:18.080
 in the computer game LEGO Universe

00:17:18.080 --> 00:17:20.960
 was to hire human moderators to make sure

00:17:20.960 --> 00:17:25.360
 that people weren't making LEGO penises.

00:17:25.360 --> 00:17:27.000
 So penis monitoring?

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:28.840
 What it was, it's one of those games, like Minecraft,

00:17:28.840 --> 00:17:30.920
 where you can build things and whatever.

00:17:30.920 --> 00:17:33.000
 And a lot of people, of course, when you can build anything

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:34.720
 you want, if you can draw anything you want,

00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:36.800
 a lot of people draw penises.

00:17:36.800 --> 00:17:38.880
 And they wanted to come up with a way

00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:40.120
 of stopping people from doing this,

00:17:40.120 --> 00:17:42.960
 because they wanted other people to go into your world.

00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:45.360
 And they didn't want children stumbling

00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:47.920
 into the world of someone who built a penis.

00:17:47.920 --> 00:17:49.640
 And so they tried to get a computer

00:17:49.640 --> 00:17:52.480
 to be able to work out when the repinises around,

00:17:52.480 --> 00:17:54.560
 but the computer couldn't do it.

00:17:54.560 --> 00:17:56.360
 They just-- it was impossible to come up

00:17:56.360 --> 00:17:58.960
 with a program that would definitely recognize

00:17:58.960 --> 00:18:01.400
 a LEGO penis above anything else.

00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:03.480
 Like sometimes they'd say something was a penis,

00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:05.320
 and actually it was a building, and sometimes they

00:18:05.320 --> 00:18:06.640
 would miss one or whatever.

00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:08.120
 And so the only way to get around it

00:18:08.120 --> 00:18:11.560
 was to get a moderation team who would check every single

00:18:11.560 --> 00:18:15.160
 erection to check that it wasn't a penis.

00:18:15.160 --> 00:18:16.080
 Oh my god.

00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:18.600
 And it cost them a fortune, and that was probably

00:18:18.600 --> 00:18:20.160
 why it went off.

00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:22.840
 And this was tweeted by a lady called Megan Fox,

00:18:22.840 --> 00:18:24.840
 who was a developer who worked on the projects,

00:18:24.840 --> 00:18:27.680
 and it was picked up by a website called Fusion.net,

00:18:27.680 --> 00:18:29.520
 who wrote an article about it last week.

00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:32.200
 See, I didn't know that Megan Fox had been branching out.

00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:33.200
 Yeah.

00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:34.200
 Good work.

00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:35.640
 You can-- just for the sake of it,

00:18:35.640 --> 00:18:38.760
 you can actually reach her on glass, bottom Meg.

00:18:38.760 --> 00:18:39.840
 That's her actual Twitter handle.

00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:41.920
 So if anyone has any questions following this podcast--

00:18:41.920 --> 00:18:43.320
 Yeah, don't ask me.

00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:44.240
 Go straight to Megan.

00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:45.080
 Wow.

00:18:45.080 --> 00:18:47.240
 Penises stop the LEGO universe game.

00:18:47.240 --> 00:18:48.040
 That's such a shame.

00:18:48.040 --> 00:18:50.240
 It's such a victory for--

00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:50.760
 Willie.

00:18:50.760 --> 00:18:53.680
 It's not a victory for innocence and joyfulness and play.

00:18:53.680 --> 00:18:54.200
 Yeah.

00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:56.280
 It's a victory for people building enormous penises.

00:18:56.280 --> 00:18:57.320
 Yeah.

00:18:57.320 --> 00:18:58.680
 But can't they, like on most websites,

00:18:58.680 --> 00:19:00.240
 you have the ability to have a parent lock.

00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:02.040
 Can they just do a kind of parent lock?

00:19:02.040 --> 00:19:04.920
 And stop children from playing the LEGO computer game.

00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:06.720
 Maybe-- no, no, no, no, maybe if you--

00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:07.080
 Warning.

00:19:07.080 --> 00:19:07.880
 It splits a penis.

00:19:07.880 --> 00:19:08.720
 It's a penis only.

00:19:08.720 --> 00:19:11.800
 Maybe it's an adult if you register your penis in it.

00:19:11.800 --> 00:19:16.360
 Like you say, I have built a penis in my universe.

00:19:16.360 --> 00:19:18.240
 And they go, penis is something you have to do

00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:22.760
 when you've done something much worse than a LEGO game.

00:19:22.760 --> 00:19:24.600
 Well, the point is it's people--

00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:26.240
 they're not worried about the people who

00:19:26.240 --> 00:19:27.320
 are going to register it.

00:19:27.320 --> 00:19:30.400
 It's the people who nefariously build these penises.

00:19:30.400 --> 00:19:32.120
 And they can you just stop them.

00:19:32.120 --> 00:19:33.800
 Because penises look a lot like other stuff.

00:19:33.800 --> 00:19:35.400
 Yeah, they look like buildings.

00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:36.400
 Snails.

00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:38.600
 [LAUGHTER]

00:19:38.600 --> 00:19:40.600
 Other penises.

00:19:40.600 --> 00:19:42.680
 Other penises.

00:19:42.680 --> 00:19:43.600
 Should we ban this?

00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:44.560
 It could be a penis.

00:19:44.560 --> 00:19:46.280
 But also, it could just be another penis.

00:19:46.280 --> 00:19:47.480
 In which case?

00:19:47.480 --> 00:19:48.560
 We should leave it.

00:19:48.560 --> 00:19:51.080
 I was reading today just on LEGO.

00:19:51.080 --> 00:19:55.360
 That Cambridge is thinking of creating a new post

00:19:55.360 --> 00:19:58.040
 for a professor, the professor of LEGO.

00:19:58.040 --> 00:19:59.640
 Not just thinking, I think they are doing it.

00:19:59.640 --> 00:20:00.160
 Yeah.

00:20:00.160 --> 00:20:01.560
 So you're going to be made of LEGO.

00:20:01.560 --> 00:20:04.280
 With loads of LEGO undergraduates as well.

00:20:04.280 --> 00:20:05.080
 [LAUGHTER]

00:20:05.080 --> 00:20:05.920
 That'd be really cool.

00:20:05.920 --> 00:20:09.040
 They basically, LEGO provided them, supposedly,

00:20:09.040 --> 00:20:12.080
 with 2.5 mil to create the post.

00:20:12.080 --> 00:20:14.200
 And it's going to be about play in education and stuff

00:20:14.200 --> 00:20:14.720
 like that.

00:20:14.720 --> 00:20:16.840
 Yeah, there might be a professor of LEGO now.

00:20:16.840 --> 00:20:19.840
 OK, so things that computers can't do, maybe.

00:20:19.840 --> 00:20:21.880
 So the US is spending a lot of money

00:20:21.880 --> 00:20:25.440
 to try and get facial recognition on people

00:20:25.440 --> 00:20:27.200
 when they're going through airports

00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:29.640
 to kind of see if they look like a terrorist.

00:20:29.640 --> 00:20:32.600
 And supposedly, there might be some little micro expressions

00:20:32.600 --> 00:20:34.560
 that people give off, like, if they're

00:20:34.560 --> 00:20:38.040
 worried by the fact that they have to go through security.

00:20:38.040 --> 00:20:39.680
 But apparently, the face of a man

00:20:39.680 --> 00:20:42.840
 about a detonator suicide belt has the same expression

00:20:42.840 --> 00:20:45.600
 as a man who realises he has left the stovon.

00:20:45.600 --> 00:20:46.600
 [LAUGHTER]

00:20:46.600 --> 00:20:47.120
 Oh, wow.

00:20:47.120 --> 00:20:48.320
 That's why they can't tell.

00:20:48.320 --> 00:20:50.880
 No, and I left the suicide belt in the stov.

00:20:50.880 --> 00:20:53.280
 Oh, this is a disaster.

00:20:53.280 --> 00:20:55.560
 It's not a-- because that's what the human face is.

00:20:55.560 --> 00:20:59.120
 There's not a specific expression for a specific situation.

00:20:59.120 --> 00:20:59.880
 It's an emotion.

00:20:59.880 --> 00:21:01.360
 [LAUGHTER]

00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:02.560
 So there we go.

00:21:02.560 --> 00:21:05.120
 Did you see that Play Do a couple of years ago

00:21:05.120 --> 00:21:07.520
 had to withdraw this--

00:21:07.520 --> 00:21:09.400
 had to withdraw this product that it was releasing

00:21:09.400 --> 00:21:12.400
 called the icing extruder after--

00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:13.240
 Oh, god.

00:21:13.240 --> 00:21:15.840
 --the complaints from parents that look like a penis.

00:21:15.840 --> 00:21:18.040
 And it was extruding icing as well.

00:21:18.040 --> 00:21:19.400
 It was extruding icing.

00:21:19.400 --> 00:21:20.600
 It was to help them make cakes.

00:21:20.600 --> 00:21:22.440
 So I think it was like a shaping tool.

00:21:22.440 --> 00:21:25.320
 But if you look at it, it is a penis and testicles.

00:21:25.320 --> 00:21:28.360
 And yeah, I think these reports said, unfortunately,

00:21:28.360 --> 00:21:31.080
 it looks more like a sex toy, albeit a three-incher,

00:21:31.080 --> 00:21:33.760
 than a child's toy, which is true.

00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:37.720
 I think that's, surely, that's all in the mind of the parents

00:21:37.720 --> 00:21:38.920
 who are dating them.

00:21:38.920 --> 00:21:42.160
 And he's just showing us the Play Do picture on his computer now.

00:21:42.160 --> 00:21:43.000
 Oh, no.

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:43.800
 Oh, yeah, so it is.

00:21:43.800 --> 00:21:46.480
 I'm amazed that Safe Search is letting it through to be honest.

00:21:46.480 --> 00:21:47.280
 But that's fine.

00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:48.120
 When you see it actually--

00:21:48.120 --> 00:21:49.600
 --lock on your own laptop.

00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:51.760
 Of course.

00:21:51.760 --> 00:21:53.840
 Every day, Andy's mom gives him his backlogs.

00:21:53.840 --> 00:21:57.920
 But it's the parent lock on his computer sent him off to work.

00:21:57.920 --> 00:22:02.080
 Have you heard about the oldest penis ever discovered?

00:22:02.080 --> 00:22:03.880
 It's not micro-brucky or sticky.

00:22:03.880 --> 00:22:04.640
 Yes, sorry.

00:22:04.640 --> 00:22:06.000
 That is the very, very oldest penis.

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:09.720
 This is the oldest man-made representation of a penis.

00:22:09.720 --> 00:22:11.640
 Oh, OK, which is a physical object, not just a drawing.

00:22:11.640 --> 00:22:16.680
 So it's 28,000 years old, which is amazing.

00:22:16.680 --> 00:22:20.640
 And it was found at the Hall of Fells cave in Switzerland, which

00:22:20.640 --> 00:22:23.080
 is a cave where they found lots and lots of really ancient stuff.

00:22:23.080 --> 00:22:26.920
 And I just love this sentence about it.

00:22:26.920 --> 00:22:29.280
 It might have been used either as a sex toy

00:22:29.280 --> 00:22:32.080
 or to do flint napping, where you sharpen flints

00:22:32.080 --> 00:22:33.720
 to use this tool.

00:22:33.720 --> 00:22:36.360
 And the BBC report said, the tubing and team working

00:22:36.360 --> 00:22:38.560
 Hall of Fells already had 13 fractured parts

00:22:38.560 --> 00:22:39.960
 of the fallace in storage.

00:22:39.960 --> 00:22:42.560
 But it was only with the discovery of a 14th fragment last year

00:22:42.560 --> 00:22:45.480
 that the team was able finally to put the dicks all together.

00:22:45.480 --> 00:22:47.920
 [LAUGHTER]

00:22:47.920 --> 00:22:48.440
 What do they think?

00:22:48.440 --> 00:22:51.000
 Well, they're making lots of shapes with it before that.

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:52.120
 Is it an elephant?

00:22:52.120 --> 00:22:53.520
 Is it an airplane?

00:22:53.520 --> 00:22:54.800
 Is it another penis?

00:22:54.800 --> 00:22:58.040
 [LAUGHTER]

00:22:58.040 --> 00:23:00.760
 Well, so that's the oldest man-made penis.

00:23:00.760 --> 00:23:03.080
 But the oldest graffiti penis, cock and balls

00:23:03.080 --> 00:23:05.320
 that someone sketched out, the oldest known one,

00:23:05.320 --> 00:23:08.200
 was discovered last year, is 2,500 years old.

00:23:08.200 --> 00:23:11.760
 And it's in this a gene island called Astipalaya,

00:23:11.760 --> 00:23:13.680
 or Astipalaya.

00:23:13.680 --> 00:23:15.400
 And it was discovered when a Princeton professor

00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:17.400
 was taking a bunch of archeology students there

00:23:17.400 --> 00:23:20.600
 to show them the wonders of the island, the island's archeology.

00:23:20.600 --> 00:23:23.560
 And they uncovered just hundreds of obscene pictures

00:23:23.560 --> 00:23:24.920
 and obscene graffiti.

00:23:24.920 --> 00:23:29.760
 So things like Nika Sittamos was here mounting tymiona

00:23:29.760 --> 00:23:32.400
 and various bits of abuse against people.

00:23:32.400 --> 00:23:35.000
 And yeah, the first picture of a cock and balls

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:37.160
 are very clear penis and two testicles.

00:23:37.160 --> 00:23:41.120
 And the Princeton professor said, Dr. Blackopoulos,

00:23:41.120 --> 00:23:43.680
 who found it, said, "What we have found

00:23:43.680 --> 00:23:45.320
 is evidence that even then, people

00:23:45.320 --> 00:23:48.000
 were using a coded language of symbols and imagery

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:49.840
 that was quite sophisticated."

00:23:49.840 --> 00:23:51.320
 I mean, it's not the Davinci code, is it?

00:23:51.320 --> 00:23:53.080
 [LAUGHTER]

00:23:53.080 --> 00:23:54.320
 Should we track on them?

00:23:54.320 --> 00:23:56.320
 Yeah, can I just mention this one last thing?

00:23:56.320 --> 00:23:57.960
 I think this has been said on QI before,

00:23:57.960 --> 00:24:01.040
 but I just really like it, which is the small penis rule.

00:24:01.040 --> 00:24:02.480
 And I'd never heard of it before.

00:24:02.480 --> 00:24:05.720
 And it's the idea that if you are in a novel trying

00:24:05.720 --> 00:24:08.640
 a basic character of someone in real life,

00:24:08.640 --> 00:24:10.440
 they can usually make an argument

00:24:10.440 --> 00:24:12.800
 that you've used them as the inspiration they can sue you.

00:24:12.800 --> 00:24:15.040
 So Michael Criton did this thing where he totally

00:24:15.040 --> 00:24:16.840
 took down someone in real life in his book.

00:24:16.840 --> 00:24:18.600
 But then he added this little extra detail,

00:24:18.600 --> 00:24:21.240
 which was the character, has a small penis.

00:24:21.240 --> 00:24:24.600
 And the guy wasn't able to sue him because he had to admit

00:24:24.600 --> 00:24:27.120
 that he has a small penis if it was him.

00:24:27.120 --> 00:24:28.280
 I would just do that.

00:24:28.280 --> 00:24:30.840
 And I'd say, OK, fine, but whatever you want.

00:24:30.840 --> 00:24:34.520
 I'm sure you can say he has drawn a malicious portrait of me,

00:24:34.520 --> 00:24:36.400
 and then he has given him another characteristic.

00:24:36.400 --> 00:24:39.040
 Yeah, I mean, you would think, but it turns out it worked.

00:24:39.040 --> 00:24:41.000
 And it's now known as the small penis rule,

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:44.040
 which is something that gets you out of being libelous.

00:24:44.040 --> 00:24:45.840
 Yeah, because you could say that, couldn't you?

00:24:45.840 --> 00:24:47.800
 But it's whether or not people are going to believe it.

00:24:47.800 --> 00:24:51.560
 Once they've seen the word small penis in a representation of you.

00:24:51.560 --> 00:24:54.280
 I mean, no one's going to not say that that was a lie.

00:24:54.280 --> 00:24:57.160
 I think also the idea is not that it will get thrown out of court.

00:24:57.160 --> 00:24:58.480
 It's that you won't bring it to court.

00:24:58.480 --> 00:24:59.480
 You won't bring it to court.

00:24:59.480 --> 00:25:02.040
 There'll be a whole cross-examination on the length of your--

00:25:02.040 --> 00:25:05.920
 Yeah, like the Barbra Streisandix effect, which we discussed last time.

00:25:05.920 --> 00:25:08.840
 That's where you just don't want to draw attention to this,

00:25:08.840 --> 00:25:10.680
 because then it'll probably get into the papers.

00:25:10.680 --> 00:25:11.200
 Yeah.

00:25:11.200 --> 00:25:13.280
 It'll be very amusing for everyone, and then you'll feel--

00:25:13.280 --> 00:25:15.840
 I read it the day about characters.

00:25:15.840 --> 00:25:18.520
 This is a bit off topic, but you know Goldfinger.

00:25:18.520 --> 00:25:19.520
 Mm-hmm.

00:25:19.520 --> 00:25:21.560
 This was named after Erno Goldfinger,

00:25:21.560 --> 00:25:24.560
 who's an architect who you try to tower and a few other things,

00:25:24.560 --> 00:25:26.200
 elephant and castle and stuff.

00:25:26.200 --> 00:25:30.720
 And he apparently was furious that Alexander Fleming--

00:25:30.720 --> 00:25:33.160
 No, that Ian Fleming had.

00:25:33.160 --> 00:25:34.400
 He was apparently furious that--

00:25:34.400 --> 00:25:37.240
 Alexander Fleming had invented penicillin,

00:25:37.240 --> 00:25:42.080
 which really made the plot more difficult to, yeah.

00:25:42.080 --> 00:25:43.280
 Do you expect me to talk?

00:25:43.280 --> 00:25:45.560
 No, Mr. Bond, I expect you to recover.

00:25:45.560 --> 00:25:48.680
 [LAUGHTER]

00:25:48.680 --> 00:25:50.480
 Anyway, no.

00:25:50.480 --> 00:25:53.080
 So yeah, he was apparently furious that--

00:25:53.080 --> 00:25:54.800
 let's just call him Fleming.

00:25:54.800 --> 00:25:59.000
 He was furious that Fleming had used his name and threatened to sue.

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:01.200
 And the publishers sort of like paid him off

00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:03.960
 and also said that they were going to put a thing at the start

00:26:03.960 --> 00:26:05.920
 of the book saying it's not based on anyone,

00:26:05.920 --> 00:26:07.480
 and it's just a coincidence, right?

00:26:07.480 --> 00:26:08.920
 And they all agree to that.

00:26:08.920 --> 00:26:11.240
 But Fleming wasn't very happy with that at all.

00:26:11.240 --> 00:26:14.040
 And he was so unhappy that he went to his publishers

00:26:14.040 --> 00:26:18.200
 and told them that he wanted to rename Goldfinger Goldpric.

00:26:18.200 --> 00:26:20.920
 [LAUGHTER]

00:26:20.920 --> 00:26:28.360
 OK, time for our final pack of the show.

00:26:28.360 --> 00:26:31.000
 And that is Chazinski.

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:33.480
 My fact is that the man who inspired the main character

00:26:33.480 --> 00:26:37.760
 in Jurassic Park is now building a chicken assaurus.

00:26:37.760 --> 00:26:39.760
 Which character in Jurassic Park is the main character?

00:26:39.760 --> 00:26:40.280
 The T-Rex.

00:26:40.280 --> 00:26:41.800
 I would have said the T-Rex.

00:26:41.800 --> 00:26:43.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:44.280
 He wants a friend.

00:26:44.280 --> 00:26:47.040
 No, this is Jack Horner, who is the pedientologist

00:26:47.040 --> 00:26:48.800
 on whom Sam Neill's character is based.

00:26:48.800 --> 00:26:49.280
 Oh, cool.

00:26:49.280 --> 00:26:50.400
 And he's called in the film.

00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:52.680
 But yet, he's a really famous pedientologist.

00:26:52.680 --> 00:26:56.840
 And he is now building what he calls either a chicken assaurus,

00:26:56.840 --> 00:27:02.520
 or a dino chicken, which gives a general idea of what it is.

00:27:02.520 --> 00:27:05.480
 How far has he got, if he's still on name, points right now?

00:27:05.480 --> 00:27:07.880
 He's been rambling with that for a good decade or so.

00:27:07.880 --> 00:27:09.520
 But no, he's got quite a long way.

00:27:09.520 --> 00:27:12.240
 So it's about genetically back-engineering

00:27:12.240 --> 00:27:15.520
 a chicken into being a dinosaur or into giving it

00:27:15.520 --> 00:27:16.600
 dinosaur characteristics.

00:27:16.600 --> 00:27:18.320
 And the three main things you need to change

00:27:18.320 --> 00:27:20.520
 are the tails that you've got to give the chicken a tail.

00:27:20.520 --> 00:27:23.080
 Because at the moment, chickens have this thing

00:27:23.080 --> 00:27:25.320
 called a pigeon style, which is the thing that

00:27:25.320 --> 00:27:27.480
 doesn't make their tail feathers move, but it's not a tail.

00:27:27.480 --> 00:27:29.840
 So give them a tail, give them claws like a dinosaur instead

00:27:29.840 --> 00:27:32.520
 of wings and give them a snout, not a beak.

00:27:32.520 --> 00:27:33.040
 And they--

00:27:33.040 --> 00:27:35.440
 And make them a hundred times bigger.

00:27:35.440 --> 00:27:37.720
 You just blow into them for that, but it's true.

00:27:37.720 --> 00:27:39.240
 OK.

00:27:39.240 --> 00:27:41.640
 And yeah, they've done the beak, I think.

00:27:41.640 --> 00:27:43.440
 So the tail's the hardest, apparently,

00:27:43.440 --> 00:27:45.040
 getting a tail on the thing.

00:27:45.040 --> 00:27:46.840
 I've seen a picture of what the beak would look like.

00:27:46.840 --> 00:27:50.280
 It's pretty snout, rather than the beak, isn't it?

00:27:50.280 --> 00:27:51.160
 Yeah, exactly.

00:27:51.160 --> 00:27:51.680
 Yeah.

00:27:51.680 --> 00:27:54.720
 Well, that's interesting, because birds had snouts

00:27:54.720 --> 00:27:56.200
 for 50 million years.

00:27:56.200 --> 00:27:58.640
 So the beak is a relatively recent innovation.

00:27:58.640 --> 00:27:59.400
 And is it better?

00:27:59.400 --> 00:28:00.880
 I think they're all better in lots of ways.

00:28:00.880 --> 00:28:01.400
 Yeah, yeah.

00:28:01.400 --> 00:28:03.120
 It must be more suited to whatever environment.

00:28:03.120 --> 00:28:03.640
 Yeah.

00:28:03.640 --> 00:28:05.920
 Because if it feels like maybe it's getting into small holes

00:28:05.920 --> 00:28:09.200
 and stuff, it would be rubbish with this snout.

00:28:09.200 --> 00:28:11.520
 It just bruises nose constantly.

00:28:11.520 --> 00:28:12.800
 It seems with dinosaurs.

00:28:12.800 --> 00:28:15.560
 So they're now saying that they had feathers.

00:28:15.560 --> 00:28:16.800
 That's a theory coming up.

00:28:16.800 --> 00:28:18.800
 I read on the other day that the Diplodocus,

00:28:18.800 --> 00:28:21.320
 we all have this impression that the long necks

00:28:21.320 --> 00:28:24.920
 is that they go out on a sort of 45 degree angle.

00:28:24.920 --> 00:28:26.200
 But actually, they were right up.

00:28:26.200 --> 00:28:27.160
 That's the new theory.

00:28:27.160 --> 00:28:29.360
 Yeah, the new theories are going to be right vertically up.

00:28:29.360 --> 00:28:30.120
 Like a giraffe.

00:28:30.120 --> 00:28:30.960
 Yeah, it was--

00:28:30.960 --> 00:28:32.680
 So they thought they were supposed to balance each other,

00:28:32.680 --> 00:28:34.760
 because it was like the tail going out one way

00:28:34.760 --> 00:28:35.960
 and the neck going out the other way and stuff.

00:28:35.960 --> 00:28:37.520
 I think the tail goes right up as well.

00:28:37.520 --> 00:28:38.800
 Yeah, that's right.

00:28:38.800 --> 00:28:42.360
 That's just what it's trying to get for a really tight leg.

00:28:42.360 --> 00:28:47.160
 Or the goalposts, or American football.

00:28:47.160 --> 00:28:49.120
 Do we know what kind of dinosaurs would have had feathers,

00:28:49.120 --> 00:28:50.760
 or is the prevailing theory that all of them had feathers?

00:28:50.760 --> 00:28:52.280
 Well, I think T-Rexes are saying--

00:28:52.280 --> 00:28:53.280
 Yeah.

00:28:53.280 --> 00:28:54.280
 T-Rexes have feathers.

00:28:54.280 --> 00:28:55.800
 And they may not have had penises.

00:28:55.800 --> 00:28:57.720
 Any of them to take it back to penises.

00:28:57.720 --> 00:29:00.120
 I think that's something that we're confident about, isn't it?

00:29:00.120 --> 00:29:00.720
 Well, no, no.

00:29:00.720 --> 00:29:03.880
 I mean, we don't know that any dinosaurs had penises.

00:29:03.880 --> 00:29:05.840
 And actually, we're not sure with a lot of them

00:29:05.840 --> 00:29:08.160
 how mechanically they had sex.

00:29:08.160 --> 00:29:09.360
 One of the things in looking to this,

00:29:09.360 --> 00:29:11.600
 because Jack Horner's has a number of dinosaurs

00:29:11.600 --> 00:29:12.560
 named after him.

00:29:12.560 --> 00:29:13.080
 I--

00:29:13.080 --> 00:29:14.080
 Holosaurus.

00:29:14.080 --> 00:29:15.080
 Yeah, maybe.

00:29:15.080 --> 00:29:15.600
 I don't know.

00:29:15.600 --> 00:29:18.120
 Actually, do you have the names on you by any chance?

00:29:18.120 --> 00:29:19.200
 Terichaptal.

00:29:19.200 --> 00:29:21.200
 Oh.

00:29:21.200 --> 00:29:23.000
 Terichaptal.

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:25.040
 I thought I knew all the dinosaurs.

00:29:25.040 --> 00:29:26.840
 I thought they were like the classic.

00:29:26.840 --> 00:29:28.040
 I thought I knew them all.

00:29:28.040 --> 00:29:30.320
 Is this like when you thought you knew all the Roman numerals?

00:29:30.320 --> 00:29:33.440
 [LAUGHTER]

00:29:33.440 --> 00:29:35.880
 It turns out there's so many dinosaurs out there

00:29:35.880 --> 00:29:39.520
 that celebrities have dinosaurs named after them.

00:29:39.520 --> 00:29:40.800
 That's how many there are.

00:29:40.800 --> 00:29:43.040
 Like, Attenborough has a dinosaur named after him.

00:29:43.040 --> 00:29:44.840
 Attenborough-Saurus.

00:29:44.840 --> 00:29:45.360
 Nice.

00:29:45.360 --> 00:29:47.800
 There's also Mark Knoffler from Dyer Straits.

00:29:47.800 --> 00:29:49.800
 The reason it's named after him is that when they were digging

00:29:49.800 --> 00:29:52.800
 in this quarry, they seemed to find this new species

00:29:52.800 --> 00:29:55.960
 anytime Dyer Straits was pumping out over the sound system.

00:29:55.960 --> 00:29:57.880
 So they were just like, get Dyer Straits back on

00:29:57.880 --> 00:29:58.800
 and they kept finding more.

00:29:58.800 --> 00:30:00.280
 So they gave that species to him.

00:30:00.280 --> 00:30:04.200
 And there's also an Elvis one called the Elvisaurus.

00:30:04.200 --> 00:30:07.400
 And it was the first dinosaur to be discovered in Antarctica,

00:30:07.400 --> 00:30:08.560
 which Elvis loved.

00:30:08.560 --> 00:30:11.240
 You know, where Elvis spent a lot of time as a boy.

00:30:11.240 --> 00:30:12.480
 Where Elvis now lives.

00:30:12.480 --> 00:30:15.080
 [LAUGHTER]

00:30:15.080 --> 00:30:17.320
 I found out really cool thing about chickens this week,

00:30:17.320 --> 00:30:20.760
 which is that we have just found a new state of matter

00:30:20.760 --> 00:30:23.200
 in the eyeball of a chicken.

00:30:23.200 --> 00:30:24.200
 How cool is that?

00:30:24.200 --> 00:30:25.760
 I thought I knew all the states of matter.

00:30:25.760 --> 00:30:27.240
 Not anymore, James.

00:30:27.240 --> 00:30:30.280
 Yeah, no, you're pulling into my trap there.

00:30:30.280 --> 00:30:32.240
 Yeah, so there were a few states of matter

00:30:32.240 --> 00:30:33.600
 aside from the standard for.

00:30:33.600 --> 00:30:37.000
 And this one is called disordered hyperuniformity,

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:37.800
 which is kind of cool.

00:30:37.800 --> 00:30:39.800
 And it's an arrangement of molecules, which is really chaotic,

00:30:39.800 --> 00:30:40.800
 if you look at it close up.

00:30:40.800 --> 00:30:43.760
 And then over large spaces, it's got a kind of uniformity.

00:30:43.760 --> 00:30:45.080
 And it's apparently acts somewhere

00:30:45.080 --> 00:30:46.920
 between a liquid and a crystal, I think.

00:30:46.920 --> 00:30:48.800
 But yeah, it just rocked up in the eye of a chicken

00:30:48.800 --> 00:30:49.840
 as they were studying it.

00:30:49.840 --> 00:30:50.480
 That's cool.

00:30:50.480 --> 00:30:53.440
 That's like when we have filums.

00:30:53.440 --> 00:30:55.920
 So every animal fits into a phylum.

00:30:55.920 --> 00:30:58.840
 And they found a whole new phylum.

00:30:58.840 --> 00:31:00.520
 And it was on the lobster's lip.

00:31:00.520 --> 00:31:02.880
 And it was just this total new type of life

00:31:02.880 --> 00:31:04.120
 that they'd not seen before.

00:31:04.120 --> 00:31:05.400
 How did they notice that?

00:31:05.400 --> 00:31:05.800
 I don't know.

00:31:05.800 --> 00:31:06.960
 How did they notice the chicken eye?

00:31:06.960 --> 00:31:07.480
 Yeah.

00:31:07.480 --> 00:31:09.800
 Oh, this doesn't look like a state of matter I've

00:31:09.800 --> 00:31:10.920
 seen anyone's eye before.

00:31:10.920 --> 00:31:12.880
 Yeah, like how would you even begin to do that?

00:31:12.880 --> 00:31:14.440
 So the industrial farming of chickens

00:31:14.440 --> 00:31:17.280
 was kind of a mistake the way it started.

00:31:17.280 --> 00:31:17.760
 Oh, yeah.

00:31:17.760 --> 00:31:18.760
 Yeah.

00:31:18.760 --> 00:31:19.680
 Explain.

00:31:19.680 --> 00:31:22.720
 Well, before 1923, when Hensel raised for meat,

00:31:22.720 --> 00:31:27.120
 there were more or less a byproduct of egg laying birds.

00:31:27.120 --> 00:31:29.560
 The end of an egg laying bird's life,

00:31:29.560 --> 00:31:31.720
 it would be killed for meat.

00:31:31.720 --> 00:31:33.440
 But there wasn't quite the same tradition

00:31:33.440 --> 00:31:35.920
 of raising lots and lots and lots of birds.

00:31:35.920 --> 00:31:38.440
 So traditional farming favored birds, which

00:31:38.440 --> 00:31:40.280
 were good for eggs and for meat, basically.

00:31:40.280 --> 00:31:42.640
 And then in 1923, a woman from Delaware

00:31:42.640 --> 00:31:45.680
 called Mrs. Cecil Steele, just blazing,

00:31:45.680 --> 00:31:49.040
 she accidentally ordered far too many birds.

00:31:49.040 --> 00:31:51.120
 She meant all of 50 and she got 500.

00:31:51.120 --> 00:31:53.400
 Was it like when you're doing your online shopping

00:31:53.400 --> 00:31:55.080
 and she accidentally bought a thousand of them?

00:31:55.080 --> 00:31:57.080
 Yeah, exactly.

00:31:57.080 --> 00:31:58.080
 And so she sold them.

00:31:58.080 --> 00:31:59.520
 And then the next year, she produced 1,000.

00:31:59.520 --> 00:32:01.960
 And her neighbors started catching on thinking, oh, wait.

00:32:01.960 --> 00:32:02.680
 This is really good.

00:32:02.680 --> 00:32:05.240
 And there's more of a market for this than we thought there was.

00:32:05.240 --> 00:32:06.840
 So people like chicken.

00:32:06.840 --> 00:32:10.200
 Yeah, in 1925, Delaware farmers made 50,000 birds.

00:32:10.200 --> 00:32:11.080
 They grew 50,000 birds.

00:32:11.080 --> 00:32:13.520
 In 1929, it was 3 million.

00:32:13.520 --> 00:32:14.040
 Wow.

00:32:14.040 --> 00:32:15.440
 And in the election, Herbert Hoover,

00:32:15.440 --> 00:32:17.280
 he promised a chicken in every pot.

00:32:17.280 --> 00:32:20.640
 And that was the kind of start of this incredible expansion

00:32:20.640 --> 00:32:22.080
 of battery farming.

00:32:22.080 --> 00:32:23.280
 When people used to cook chickens,

00:32:23.280 --> 00:32:26.120
 they used to want to make them sing for some reason.

00:32:26.120 --> 00:32:27.960
 Or when it's just come out the oven,

00:32:27.960 --> 00:32:29.480
 they used to want to make it sing.

00:32:29.480 --> 00:32:33.360
 And what they used to do is put mercury inside the chicken

00:32:33.360 --> 00:32:35.080
 and then kind of sew it up.

00:32:35.080 --> 00:32:38.760
 And then that would kind of expand and make air inside the chicken.

00:32:38.760 --> 00:32:40.880
 And then they make a tiny hole, I think.

00:32:40.880 --> 00:32:42.480
 And then it would kind of tweet.

00:32:42.480 --> 00:32:44.720
 Wow, that's so clever.

00:32:44.720 --> 00:32:45.520
 It's amazing.

00:32:45.520 --> 00:32:47.800
 It's clever, apart from the fact that it's highly close.

00:32:47.800 --> 00:32:49.560
 Yeah, you're a dinner.

00:32:49.560 --> 00:32:50.640
 It's worth it, though, for that.

00:32:50.640 --> 00:32:55.280
 So it's like taking it out and the chicken going, tada!

00:32:55.280 --> 00:32:58.200
 Not everyone is happy with the chicken asaurus idea

00:32:58.200 --> 00:32:59.960
 of making a chicken asaurus.

00:32:59.960 --> 00:33:04.880
 So one of the colleagues of Dr. Horner has said this.

00:33:04.880 --> 00:33:06.000
 It was in BBC report.

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:08.080
 Has he said, get back in your corner, Jack.

00:33:08.080 --> 00:33:09.680
 No, he hasn't.

00:33:09.680 --> 00:33:10.680
 He should have done.

00:33:10.680 --> 00:33:11.680
 He should have.

00:33:11.680 --> 00:33:13.240
 Can I say he gets that a lot?

00:33:13.240 --> 00:33:16.160
 He said, technically, you're going to have a messed up chicken.

00:33:16.160 --> 00:33:16.960
 It's not a dinosaur.

00:33:16.960 --> 00:33:18.280
 It's never going to be a dinosaur.

00:33:18.280 --> 00:33:20.560
 It's just going to be a really awful monstrosity.

00:33:20.560 --> 00:33:21.720
 I would agree with that, actually.

00:33:21.720 --> 00:33:23.720
 I think what you're making is not a dinosaur.

00:33:23.720 --> 00:33:26.400
 You're making a chicken with dinosaur characteristics, right?

00:33:26.400 --> 00:33:29.520
 But if all the genes survive somewhere,

00:33:29.520 --> 00:33:30.640
 I find that really interesting.

00:33:30.640 --> 00:33:32.520
 So the idea is that chickens somewhere

00:33:32.520 --> 00:33:36.080
 will have DNA that was inside dinosaurs, right?

00:33:36.080 --> 00:33:38.080
 Well, some of it will be inactive or some of it

00:33:38.080 --> 00:33:40.480
 would have been thrown away or just evolved away over it.

00:33:40.480 --> 00:33:42.680
 What is true is that the chicken that you had for dinner

00:33:42.680 --> 00:33:44.720
 yesterday, its parents were chicken.

00:33:44.720 --> 00:33:46.920
 That chicken's parents were chicken, and they were chicken,

00:33:46.920 --> 00:33:48.560
 and they were chicken, and they were chicken.

00:33:48.560 --> 00:33:50.160
 And then if you got far enough, their parents

00:33:50.160 --> 00:33:51.360
 would have been a dinosaur.

00:33:51.360 --> 00:33:52.440
 I think that's so cool.

00:33:52.440 --> 00:33:54.680
 I think one of the main things is, say, for instance,

00:33:54.680 --> 00:33:55.880
 a tail.

00:33:55.880 --> 00:33:57.400
 A chicken embryo has a tail.

00:33:57.400 --> 00:34:00.400
 But then it kind of gets reabsorbed back into the embryo.

00:34:00.400 --> 00:34:02.040
 And there's a gene that does that.

00:34:02.040 --> 00:34:04.800
 If you can turn that gene off, then tail will continue

00:34:04.800 --> 00:34:07.000
 to grow, and then you'll have a chicken with a tail.

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:09.080
 And actually human embryos also have tails.

00:34:09.080 --> 00:34:09.920
 So, really?

00:34:09.920 --> 00:34:11.560
 Yeah, we reabsorbed them as well.

00:34:11.560 --> 00:34:14.160
 Theoretically, if you could find the gene in humans

00:34:14.160 --> 00:34:16.960
 and turn that off, then you could have humans with tails.

00:34:16.960 --> 00:34:19.640
 Would it be a hairy tail, like a monkey's tail?

00:34:19.640 --> 00:34:21.240
 But Sharon, I would say it must be.

00:34:21.240 --> 00:34:22.880
 I know, because it would be, but then again--

00:34:22.880 --> 00:34:24.440
 Because it hasn't evolved with the rest of us.

00:34:24.440 --> 00:34:25.320
 Yeah, we've been on hairy.

00:34:25.320 --> 00:34:28.040
 Humans aren't hairy all over like that.

00:34:28.040 --> 00:34:28.960
 By them.

00:34:28.960 --> 00:34:31.240
 [LAUGHTER]

00:34:31.240 --> 00:34:33.400
 They think, getting the tail reabsorption

00:34:33.400 --> 00:34:36.640
 gene to stop turning off is something they think they might

00:34:36.640 --> 00:34:40.400
 crack, because they've worked out how to turn on a gecko's tail

00:34:40.400 --> 00:34:41.400
 reabsorption.

00:34:41.400 --> 00:34:44.600
 So, scientists have learned how to make a gecko embryo

00:34:44.600 --> 00:34:45.960
 reabsorb its own tail.

00:34:45.960 --> 00:34:46.960
 This is so exciting.

00:34:46.960 --> 00:34:47.480
 Yeah.

00:34:47.480 --> 00:34:49.520
 I think in the future, when you're having a baby,

00:34:49.520 --> 00:34:53.120
 you'll be able to tick all the boxes for you to tail.

00:34:53.120 --> 00:34:57.080
 Will it be, will it be, will it be, pushed, clipped?

00:34:57.080 --> 00:34:57.600
 It's fraggly.

00:34:57.600 --> 00:35:01.320
 OK, that's it.

00:35:01.320 --> 00:35:02.240
 That's all of our facts.

00:35:02.240 --> 00:35:03.480
