00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580
 (upbeat music)

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:13.440
 - Hello, and welcome to another episode

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:14.480
 of No Steps to Thing as a Fish,

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:15.680
 a weekly podcast coming to you

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:17.420
 from the QI offices in Hoban.

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:18.480
 My name is Andrew Hunter Murray.

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.580
 I'm here with Dan Schreiber, James Harkin,

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.460
 and Anna Tijinski, and we have gathered

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:26.620
 around the table for a quarterly, I think.

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:28.820
 - We aim for that, but we only did three last year.

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:29.660
 - There we go.

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:30.800
 - A...

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:32.240
 Triennial...

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:35.400
 Show, where we go through the fish inbox,

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:37.540
 podcast@qi.com, we find the best facts

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:40.440
 that you have sent to us, and we read them back to you.

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.320
 So we've all learned from each other, and it's all square.

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:44.880
 The inbox has had lots and lots of brilliant

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:45.920
 fact submissions over the last few months.

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:46.980
 - It's overflowing, Andy.

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.020
 - It's bulging.

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:49.360
 We've got a bulging post-bag.

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:51.660
 - We have physical things to read.

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.060
 - Yes, so the guys here have not seen

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:55.820
 the facts that we've been sent.

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:57.620
 I have brought them in, printed them out on bits of paper,

00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:59.000
 and chopped the bits of paper up.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.140
 We all have a stack of small slips of paper in front of us,

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.340
 and we're going to see if this works,

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:03.400
 which I think it might.

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:06.300
 So let's have a fact, if anyone's got one.

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:09.680
 - Okay, I'm going to open with a fact from Leander,

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:11.140
 from Switzerland.

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:14.380
 Inkus, the last Carolina parakeet,

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:16.780
 died in the same cage as Martha,

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:18.820
 the last passenger pigeon.

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:20.220
 - Oh, that's interesting.

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:21.280
 - No further info.

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:22.120
 - Crazy.

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:23.120
 - It's, yeah, mad.

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:25.320
 - Are we saying that it's a cursed cage?

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:26.300
 - Must be.

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:27.820
 - It's got to be, unless they just killed each other,

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:29.540
 it's one of those fights of the death where they both.

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:31.340
 - So wait, what was it, the last passenger pigeon,

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:32.180
 and the last, what, sorry?

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:33.780
 - The last Carolina parakeet,

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.980
 which does seem quite specific, but still cool.

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:38.140
 - Still, still, it's two of a kind.

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:39.340
 - Oh yeah, actually, when I first read it,

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:40.840
 I thought that it was Inkus,

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:42.500
 the last Carolina parakeet,

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:44.700
 and Martha, and now it would have been even more amazing.

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.180
 - All the Inkus died.

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:47.380
 - All the Inkus died.

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:49.500
 - This sounds like, I hope Stephen King isn't listening,

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.280
 'cause that sounds right up his street of a murderous cage.

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:54.780
 - The cursed cage, yeah, yeah.

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.160
 - It could be a sort of like a retirement home of cages,

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:00.860
 where it's, you know, it's the last of a species goes there.

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:03.340
 - Yeah, it's really, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:04.180
 - Maybe.

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:07.300
 - They see like little pictures on the cage wall

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:09.140
 of the previous tenants, you know.

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:10.700
 - Is that what they do in all people's homes and stuff?

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:12.420
 They have the pictures of the analysis.

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.620
 - Have you ever watched the traitors?

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:14.660
 Whenever anyone leaves,

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:16.420
 they put a big red cross through their face.

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:17.740
 They do that in all people's homes as well.

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:18.580
 - I didn't know that.

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:19.400
 - That's how it works.

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.740
 - Oh, you know, you gotta face up to the truth, don't you?

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:22.740
 - Yeah.

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:24.220
 - Gosh.

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:25.060
 - Well, that's a great fact.

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:27.740
 - It's an excellent fact, very cool.

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:28.860
 - Can I do one, honey?

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:29.700
 - Yeah.

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.020
 - This is from Hediver, and it says,

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:35.860
 "Dear Anna, you are always my favorite podcast host."

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:36.920
 - Yeah, that makes sense.

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:39.340
 - I feel like I picked up the wrong pile here.

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:40.180
 - That's a good fact.

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:41.020
 It's not an interesting fact.

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:42.260
 It's a pretty basic fact.

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:43.220
 We've had it loads.

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:44.940
 - If someone else has taken over the mailbox,

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:46.860
 duty please disregard that.

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:47.700
 - Yes, thank you.

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:50.500
 - Consider it disregarded, Hediver.

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:53.900
 I write now to share the most fish fact I have ever learned.

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:56.620
 There is one extant species of marsupial,

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:00.540
 the water opossum, in which the males have pouches.

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:02.940
 These pouches are not used to host joeys,

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:04.860
 but serve the exclusive purpose

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:06.940
 of storing the male genitalia

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:09.980
 to prevent them from getting tangled in weeds while swimming.

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:10.860
 (laughing)

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:11.700
 - Wow.

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:13.540
 - That's so good.

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:14.380
 - That's incredible.

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:15.660
 - Tangled in weeds.

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:17.140
 - Do you wish you had that?

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:19.380
 - I don't go while swimming like you do, Anna.

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:21.940
 - No, okay, and I don't get stuff tangled in weeds too.

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:23.460
 - I'm always getting tangled in weeds.

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:25.220
 (laughing)

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:28.180
 - I can't picture the genitals of,

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:29.500
 can anyone of this particular animal?

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:32.060
 - If it's marsupial, then it will be

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:34.380
 quite a big bull sack kangaroos, have a leg.

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:37.300
 I have a kangaroo bull sack purse at home.

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:38.740
 (laughing)

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:39.580
 Two dozen.

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:40.900
 (laughing)

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:43.580
 - To see James tip in a restaurant is quite a sight.

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:44.420
 (laughing)

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:47.060
 As he gets out his little pantsnay glasses,

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:47.900
 (laughing)

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:50.740
 and opens the glass on his kangaroo scrotum.

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:51.580
 - Yeah.

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:54.580
 - I thought you guys knew that, that I had that.

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:56.140
 I bought it when we were on tour the first time

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:56.980
 in Australia. - Did you?

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:57.820
 - Yeah.

00:03:57.820 --> 00:03:59.940
 - That's, yeah, it's ringing a bell now, yeah.

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:02.380
 - So what was it? - Is it roomy?

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:03.940
 (laughing)

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:06.260
 - No, not, well, you could probably keep

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:07.820
 a couple of billiard balls in it.

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:09.660
 - Oh, okay, that is roomy.

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:12.700
 I don't mean to give away too much.

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:13.540
 (laughing)

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:14.780
 I am impressed.

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:18.580
 - But yeah, kangaroos have got quite large scrotum.

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:19.420
 - And what's this called?

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:20.260
 There's marsupial.

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:21.460
 - This is a water opossum.

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:22.900
 But I think generally speaking,

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:26.220
 marsupials have similar reproductive systems, don't they?

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:27.060
 - Yeah.

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:28.100
 - They all tend to have like,

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:29.820
 uteruses with three openings.

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:30.660
 - Mm.

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:32.100
 - Did that specify where the pouch was?

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:33.500
 'Cause I'm picturing a kangaroo pouch,

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:34.940
 and that feels like quite a long journey to-

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:36.300
 - Probably not far off.

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:37.380
 (laughing)

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:38.700
 - It's probably not far off, though.

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:41.220
 - You can't tuck yours in your top pocket, for instance.

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:42.560
 (laughing)

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:44.860
 Have you forgotten one of those little handkerchiefs?

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:47.100
 (laughing)

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:49.140
 - But the way evolution works is so mad.

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:50.940
 'Cause it must have started out as a little skin flap

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:51.780
 or something.

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:52.620
 - Yeah.

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:55.300
 - And presumably fewer male water opossums drowned

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:57.380
 because they had this little evolutionary skin flap.

00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:58.900
 - Well, all had their testicles torn off

00:04:58.900 --> 00:04:59.740
 and couldn't reproduce.

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:00.580
 - Right, exactly.

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:01.860
 But there must have been a way in which like,

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:03.620
 have you heard the latest thing in the water opossum world

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:06.900
 is this little flap of skin, which protects your knackers?

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:08.580
 I just think that's, it's unbelievable.

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:10.020
 And then those are the fit ones that survived.

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:10.860
 - It's crazy.

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:13.160
 And of course, with this entire format,

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:15.940
 we are relying on the people who wrote to us

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:17.140
 telling us the truth.

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:17.980
 - Oh yeah.

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:20.620
 I've done no quality control on these whatsoever.

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:21.740
 - Do your own research, guys.

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:23.940
 We do it every week, you know?

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:25.420
 Still haven't taken some responsibility.

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:26.580
 - But ahead of that, I believe you.

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:27.420
 - Very cool.

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:28.260
 - Brilliant.

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:29.080
 - Shall I do one?

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:29.920
 - Yeah.

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:30.900
 - This is from Dr. Kevin W. Jennings,

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:34.460
 Department of Social Sciences, Lincoln Memorial University.

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:37.340
 Astronaut Steve Hawley's space shuttle launches

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:38.740
 kept getting scrubbed.

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:41.820
 He had 15 or 16 launches scrubbed in his career.

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:43.500
 A record, question mark.

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:46.460
 After one scrub, I think scrub means didn't happen.

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:47.300
 - Capsled.

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:48.140
 - Yeah.

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:50.020
 - You know, that's some no scrubs.

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:51.180
 It's written by an astronaut

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:52.940
 who really wanted to go into space.

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:56.940
 - After one scrub prior to his fourth mission,

00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:58.420
 he remarked that the space shuttle

00:05:58.420 --> 00:06:00.220
 obviously knew he was aboard.

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:02.340
 So it was refusing to launch.

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:03.420
 His crewmates agreed.

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:05.460
 So they made him wear a disguise

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:07.060
 during the next launch attempt.

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:07.900
 - No.

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:09.300
 - They're all in spacesuits.

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:11.580
 How much better disguise can you get?

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:15.860
 - Yeah, so they made him wear a disguise

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:17.020
 during the next launch attempt.

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:19.220
 So the shuttle wouldn't recognize him.

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:20.100
 It worked.

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:22.460
 And the shuttle launched on that attempt.

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:25.540
 The crew of his fifth mission forced him to do it again.

00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:26.660
 And it was successful again.

00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:29.540
 Apparently the space shuttle just didn't like him.

00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:30.860
 Pictures for a proof.

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:32.660
 And then Andy's not included the pictures.

00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:33.500
 - Oh, no.

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:35.540
 - But wow.

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:36.500
 - The pictures seem essential.

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:39.740
 This disguise, was it a kangaroo disguise?

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:42.300
 Was it, what could it have been?

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:46.300
 - Testicles were popping out of the book.

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:47.700
 It's called Harley this guy.

00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:48.700
 - Steve Hawley.

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:49.540
 - That's amazing.

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:50.380
 - Very cool.

00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:51.540
 - God, and that's the scientists who believed that.

00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:53.140
 These are the people who were trusting to build rockets.

00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:55.300
 People who think space shuttles decide against people.

00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:57.780
 - The astronauts, they'll build the rockets.

00:06:57.780 --> 00:06:58.620
 - Oh, do they know?

00:06:58.620 --> 00:06:59.820
 I thought you had to do it all the way through.

00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:01.220
 - Dan, was that from an eminent scientist?

00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:02.060
 Did you say?

00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:03.460
 - That was from a doctor.

00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:04.300
 - Okay.

00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:05.140
 - It's not eminent, is it?

00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:05.980
 That'd be professor.

00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:10.100
 - You get away with nothing in this game.

00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:11.620
 - I'm a moderately achieving scientist.

00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:12.460
 - Okay.

00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:14.020
 Well, this, geez.

00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:15.580
 Here's an email from Colin McIntyre,

00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:17.820
 who says, "I'm the educator and resident historian

00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:20.220
 "of the New England Aquarium in Boston."

00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:21.060
 - Cool.

00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:23.020
 - "It entertains me and my colleagues no end

00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:25.420
 "when our beloved aquarium is mentioned on your podcast,

00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:28.340
 "e.g. Andre the seal, Animal Bartering,

00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:31.060
 "but we've never heard you refer to it by its actual name.

00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:32.100
 "As a friend of the podcast,

00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:33.560
 "I believe we've earned the right to be called

00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:34.740
 "the New England Aquarium

00:07:34.740 --> 00:07:37.500
 "rather than just an aquarium in Boston."

00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:38.340
 So fair enough.

00:07:38.340 --> 00:07:39.420
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:07:39.420 --> 00:07:42.900
 - And he's included some facts and here's one of them.

00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:46.060
 There is a mummified cod buried in the foundation

00:07:46.060 --> 00:07:48.260
 of the New England Aquarium,

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:50.460
 but that's not the weird thing about it, I think.

00:07:50.460 --> 00:07:52.620
 What he says is it's called Ichabod.

00:07:52.620 --> 00:07:56.900
 The fish started the construction of the entire aquarium.

00:07:56.900 --> 00:07:58.100
 This is mad.

00:07:58.100 --> 00:08:00.420
 So the fish was the star

00:08:00.420 --> 00:08:03.680
 of the aquarium's groundbreaking ceremony in 1965,

00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:05.300
 when a scuba diver holding him

00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:07.020
 emerged from nearby Boston Harbor

00:08:07.020 --> 00:08:08.540
 and dropped him into a tank of water.

00:08:08.540 --> 00:08:10.980
 So at this point, it's a live fish.

00:08:10.980 --> 00:08:13.860
 This electronically triggered the construction equipment

00:08:13.860 --> 00:08:16.380
 on the future site of the aquarium,

00:08:16.380 --> 00:08:19.820
 thanks to a system designed by Harold Doc Egerton.

00:08:19.820 --> 00:08:23.260
 So the New England Aquarium was,

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:24.980
 the construction was kick-started by a fish

00:08:24.980 --> 00:08:26.260
 being dropped into a tank of water.

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:27.100
 - It was intentional.

00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:28.740
 - That was what it was always going to be, right?

00:08:28.740 --> 00:08:29.580
 - Yes.

00:08:29.580 --> 00:08:30.420
 - They planned.

00:08:30.420 --> 00:08:32.300
 - This was meant to be a library,

00:08:32.300 --> 00:08:33.940
 but we were going to drop in a book,

00:08:33.940 --> 00:08:36.780
 but then we dropped in a fish by mistake.

00:08:36.780 --> 00:08:38.240
 It's hard to tell if rockets know

00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:39.660
 which astronauts are going to go.

00:08:39.660 --> 00:08:40.500
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:42.540
 So they decided to build as a aquarium,

00:08:42.540 --> 00:08:43.620
 starting with a fish.

00:08:43.620 --> 00:08:44.460
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:08:44.460 --> 00:08:46.140
 A scuba diver comes out of the water holding a live fish,

00:08:46.140 --> 00:08:47.140
 drops it into a tank,

00:08:47.140 --> 00:08:49.580
 and that electronically senses a fish has been dropped in

00:08:49.580 --> 00:08:51.420
 and triggers the construction equipment.

00:08:51.420 --> 00:08:53.180
 That is a very cool opening ceremony.

00:08:53.180 --> 00:08:55.220
 - You know, like if you watch the Olympics,

00:08:55.220 --> 00:08:58.540
 they have the word they set off the fire, the flame.

00:08:58.540 --> 00:09:00.220
 They always do something really exciting,

00:09:00.220 --> 00:09:02.060
 but actually it's just a guy with a button

00:09:02.060 --> 00:09:03.500
 who's sat next to it, right?

00:09:03.500 --> 00:09:04.340
 - Right.

00:09:04.340 --> 00:09:06.380
 - I feel like I would do it in this situation as well.

00:09:06.380 --> 00:09:07.220
 I'm sorry to say.

00:09:07.220 --> 00:09:08.940
 - Do you mean like there was that famous one

00:09:08.940 --> 00:09:10.580
 where an archer shot the flame

00:09:10.580 --> 00:09:11.980
 and we all thought it landed?

00:09:11.980 --> 00:09:14.660
 Yeah, but it was, I see, yes.

00:09:14.660 --> 00:09:15.500
 - And who was it?

00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:16.340
 Which president?

00:09:16.340 --> 00:09:17.180
 There was a president who had to tell

00:09:17.180 --> 00:09:19.100
 on the Christmas lights once remotely.

00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:21.020
 And he thought, I think it was in the '50s,

00:09:21.020 --> 00:09:23.780
 it was maybe it was Lyndon Johnson,

00:09:23.780 --> 00:09:26.380
 and he thought he was doing it remotely

00:09:26.380 --> 00:09:28.700
 'cause of this amazing remote light turning on technology.

00:09:28.700 --> 00:09:29.980
 And actually, I think there was just someone

00:09:29.980 --> 00:09:31.700
 that lights in the White House who just looked to switch.

00:09:31.700 --> 00:09:32.820
 - Yeah, right.

00:09:32.820 --> 00:09:34.620
 - Maybe that's how it's happening all over the world.

00:09:34.620 --> 00:09:36.740
 - So you're casting doubt on this, James, I think.

00:09:36.740 --> 00:09:38.340
 - I'm just saying that if I was in charge,

00:09:38.340 --> 00:09:39.620
 I wouldn't rely on the fish.

00:09:39.620 --> 00:09:40.660
 - Yeah, that's fair.

00:09:40.660 --> 00:09:44.340
 When the Queen, the true Queen, sent her first tweet

00:09:44.340 --> 00:09:46.060
 or whatever, she pressed a button,

00:09:46.060 --> 00:09:48.540
 and then I think it just like prodded a nearby intern

00:09:48.540 --> 00:09:50.740
 to a friend and sent tweet.

00:09:50.740 --> 00:09:52.420
 I seem to remember.

00:09:52.420 --> 00:09:54.220
 - Wow, a fister of a Jack in a book.

00:09:54.220 --> 00:09:57.820
 Here's one from Ralph Linsangan.

00:09:57.820 --> 00:09:59.020
 He says he's a big fan.

00:09:59.020 --> 00:10:00.340
 Thanks, Ralph.

00:10:00.340 --> 00:10:01.380
 And-

00:10:01.380 --> 00:10:03.060
 - Of yours or of all of us?

00:10:03.060 --> 00:10:03.900
 - I've got a scene of mine.

00:10:03.900 --> 00:10:04.940
 - What's your doctorate in?

00:10:04.940 --> 00:10:05.780
 Ralph?

00:10:07.460 --> 00:10:10.220
 - America's just 71 miles long,

00:10:10.220 --> 00:10:12.460
 measured from its easternmost point

00:10:12.460 --> 00:10:15.300
 to its westernmost point.

00:10:15.300 --> 00:10:18.620
 And he's talking about that trick fact,

00:10:18.620 --> 00:10:20.860
 which is the Aleutian Islands,

00:10:20.860 --> 00:10:22.580
 which cross the 180th Meridian.

00:10:22.580 --> 00:10:24.540
 So they constitute the easternmost

00:10:24.540 --> 00:10:25.740
 and the westernmost point,

00:10:25.740 --> 00:10:27.340
 but the other way around to which you'd think.

00:10:27.340 --> 00:10:28.180
 - Interesting.

00:10:28.180 --> 00:10:29.540
 - Because the easternmost point is the furthest

00:10:29.540 --> 00:10:31.740
 sort of west from where we are.

00:10:31.740 --> 00:10:33.180
 So there you go.

00:10:33.180 --> 00:10:34.020
 - That's a great fact.

00:10:34.020 --> 00:10:34.860
 - Yeah, that's awesome.

00:10:34.860 --> 00:10:35.700
 - It is.

00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:36.540
 And I remember, we were actually just talking

00:10:36.540 --> 00:10:39.180
 about the Aleutian Islands in a podcast we recorded,

00:10:39.180 --> 00:10:41.140
 which may have gone out by the time this goes out,

00:10:41.140 --> 00:10:42.700
 or it may not have.

00:10:42.700 --> 00:10:44.100
 It's about Alaska.

00:10:44.100 --> 00:10:45.420
 But we were talking about something

00:10:45.420 --> 00:10:46.260
 that I don't think as well-

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:47.420
 - It was last week's show.

00:10:47.420 --> 00:10:48.380
 - It was last week's show.

00:10:48.380 --> 00:10:49.220
 There you go.

00:10:49.220 --> 00:10:50.660
 We were talking about something,

00:10:50.660 --> 00:10:51.580
 I don't think it's well known enough,

00:10:51.580 --> 00:10:53.980
 that the only land war fought in America

00:10:53.980 --> 00:10:56.300
 in the Second World War was in the Aleutian Islands,

00:10:56.300 --> 00:10:57.140
 with the Japanese just-

00:10:57.140 --> 00:10:57.980
 - That was Japan, USA.

00:10:57.980 --> 00:10:59.100
 I didn't think any bit of America

00:10:59.100 --> 00:11:02.260
 had ever been occupied in the Second World War.

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:04.380
 - Everyone forgets, Fuehler Islands.

00:11:04.380 --> 00:11:05.220
 - Yeah.

00:11:05.220 --> 00:11:08.780
 - That's the bit where humans walked across, isn't it?

00:11:08.780 --> 00:11:10.340
 You know, there was a land bridge there.

00:11:10.340 --> 00:11:11.180
 - Oh really?

00:11:11.180 --> 00:11:12.340
 - From which side?

00:11:12.340 --> 00:11:14.900
 - Well, Andy nodded, so you get a klaxon,

00:11:14.900 --> 00:11:16.860
 because it's not true.

00:11:16.860 --> 00:11:18.100
 And this is recent.

00:11:18.100 --> 00:11:20.340
 They've kind of looked at what it would have been like

00:11:20.340 --> 00:11:22.380
 around the time when humans came over,

00:11:22.380 --> 00:11:24.300
 and that would have been pretty much impossible

00:11:24.300 --> 00:11:27.180
 to walk over, because it was so muddy

00:11:27.180 --> 00:11:29.700
 and swampy and stuff like that.

00:11:29.700 --> 00:11:32.860
 So they must have gone across in either boats,

00:11:32.860 --> 00:11:37.220
 or you know, like putting huge tennis rackets on your shoes.

00:11:37.220 --> 00:11:38.540
 - Like Pogo Sticks, isn't it?

00:11:38.540 --> 00:11:39.900
 - Oh, Pogo Sticks could have done it, yeah,

00:11:39.900 --> 00:11:41.860
 but there's no way you could have walked across.

00:11:41.860 --> 00:11:44.140
 It wasn't a bridge in the modern sense of the word.

00:11:44.140 --> 00:11:45.220
 - Really? - Yeah, right.

00:11:45.220 --> 00:11:47.900
 So here's the fact that I think could have been for you, Dan,

00:11:47.900 --> 00:11:51.020
 because they referenced two of your facts from history.

00:11:51.020 --> 00:11:51.860
 - Okay.

00:11:51.860 --> 00:11:53.140
 - It's from Vic Olds.

00:11:53.140 --> 00:11:55.980
 And they say, "I've been meaning to send in this fact

00:11:55.980 --> 00:11:57.020
 "for a long time and have been,

00:11:57.020 --> 00:11:58.660
 "after hearing your recent facts

00:11:58.660 --> 00:12:01.940
 "about Harry Balls and Willie Hull,

00:12:01.940 --> 00:12:04.340
 "I believe I have a female name to rival them.

00:12:04.340 --> 00:12:07.260
 "About time we had some representation on this show, Dan."

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:09.220
 - Back away. - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

00:12:09.220 --> 00:12:12.260
 - "In 1943, a horse called Count Fleet

00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:15.460
 "achieved the US Triple Crown in horse racing.

00:12:15.460 --> 00:12:19.380
 "His owner/trainer was called Fanny Hertz.

00:12:19.380 --> 00:12:22.300
 "And I believe it does sometimes when you ride horses."

00:12:22.300 --> 00:12:24.220
 (laughing)

00:12:24.220 --> 00:12:25.780
 - Very strong. - Lovely.

00:12:25.780 --> 00:12:28.820
 - Very strong, Fanny Hertz. - The famous hymen breaker,

00:12:28.820 --> 00:12:30.620
 you're always told as a kid.

00:12:30.620 --> 00:12:31.460
 - Is that right?

00:12:31.460 --> 00:12:34.140
 - Always told as a girl, don't worry.

00:12:34.140 --> 00:12:36.620
 Your hymen doesn't always break when you lose your virginity

00:12:36.620 --> 00:12:38.660
 because you might have been a horse rider.

00:12:38.660 --> 00:12:39.500
 - Yeah.

00:12:39.500 --> 00:12:40.340
 - And that probably would have broken it.

00:12:40.340 --> 00:12:41.700
 Gross for the horses.

00:12:41.700 --> 00:12:43.100
 (laughing)

00:12:43.100 --> 00:12:45.060
 - You're not doing it naked, are you?

00:12:45.060 --> 00:12:46.980
 - Well, it depends which riding school you attend.

00:12:46.980 --> 00:12:47.820
 - Yeah.

00:12:47.820 --> 00:12:49.140
 Shall I do my next one?

00:12:49.140 --> 00:12:51.140
 - Yeah, we probably had enough hymen chat.

00:12:51.140 --> 00:12:51.980
 (farting)

00:12:51.980 --> 00:12:53.780
 - I was curious about the name Sherlock

00:12:53.780 --> 00:12:57.060
 and how common it was in general use in the UK.

00:12:57.060 --> 00:12:58.500
 Turns out very not.

00:12:58.500 --> 00:12:59.860
 - According to...

00:12:59.860 --> 00:13:01.260
 (laughing)

00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:02.900
 - Did you write the same old time?

00:13:02.900 --> 00:13:04.580
 (laughing)

00:13:04.580 --> 00:13:05.580
 - Very not.

00:13:05.580 --> 00:13:07.660
 - Did I say very not?

00:13:07.660 --> 00:13:08.500
 - He said it. - Yeah.

00:13:08.500 --> 00:13:09.940
 - Who wrote the same old?

00:13:09.940 --> 00:13:11.140
 - I'll come to that a bit.

00:13:11.140 --> 00:13:12.620
 Turns out not very.

00:13:12.620 --> 00:13:14.380
 (laughing)

00:13:14.380 --> 00:13:15.220
 - Oh.

00:13:15.220 --> 00:13:16.780
 (laughing)

00:13:16.780 --> 00:13:21.260
 - According to free BMD, births and marriages and deaths,

00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:23.780
 there were seven children registered with the name Sherlock

00:13:23.780 --> 00:13:27.180
 between 1837 and 1887 when Conan Doyle

00:13:27.180 --> 00:13:29.140
 first published the fictional detective.

00:13:29.140 --> 00:13:33.420
 Between 1890 and 1920, there were 16 Sherlocks born,

00:13:33.420 --> 00:13:36.060
 half of whom also had the surname Holmes.

00:13:36.060 --> 00:13:38.580
 So families called Holmes seemed to like

00:13:38.580 --> 00:13:40.180
 having a son called Sherlock.

00:13:40.180 --> 00:13:43.460
 One family in Pontefract had both a Sherlock and a Mycroft.

00:13:43.460 --> 00:13:44.460
 - Oh.

00:13:44.460 --> 00:13:48.780
 - The sons of Richard Holmes and Martha, Ney Belch.

00:13:48.780 --> 00:13:51.700
 So fan worship isn't anything new.

00:13:51.700 --> 00:13:53.820
 It goes on, but the last Sherlock Holmes

00:13:53.820 --> 00:13:56.060
 was born in 1942 in Stoke.

00:13:56.060 --> 00:13:57.820
 I believe he is still alive.

00:13:57.820 --> 00:14:01.340
 And if so, would be the last of the gentlemen still standing.

00:14:01.340 --> 00:14:03.020
 And that's from Guy Holmes.

00:14:03.020 --> 00:14:04.420
 - Ah, lovely. - Oh, nice.

00:14:04.420 --> 00:14:05.460
 - That's very cool.

00:14:05.460 --> 00:14:07.340
 - Yeah, really cool research.

00:14:07.340 --> 00:14:08.180
 - Right, here's one.

00:14:08.180 --> 00:14:10.260
 Evan Friedman, American actor, Jerry Hallever,

00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:12.860
 has appeared as Saddam Hussein in six separate films.

00:14:12.860 --> 00:14:15.220
 In fact, Saddam Hussein is the only character

00:14:15.220 --> 00:14:16.860
 he's ever played.

00:14:16.860 --> 00:14:17.700
 - Right.

00:14:17.700 --> 00:14:18.700
 - That's very good.

00:14:18.700 --> 00:14:19.740
 - Typecasting.

00:14:19.740 --> 00:14:21.820
 - I have a typecasting fact that I was gonna suggest

00:14:21.820 --> 00:14:23.100
 for a future show.

00:14:23.100 --> 00:14:24.260
 Well, maybe I'll say it now.

00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:25.100
 - Yeah.

00:14:25.100 --> 00:14:27.220
 - So the woman who won Best Spotting Actress

00:14:27.220 --> 00:14:31.300
 before Gone With The Wind in 1939 was Hattie McDaniel.

00:14:31.300 --> 00:14:34.100
 And she played the same role

00:14:34.100 --> 00:14:38.340
 in I think it's about 130 other movies.

00:14:38.340 --> 00:14:39.180
 - Basically.

00:14:39.180 --> 00:14:41.820
 - Not the same character, but the same style of character.

00:14:41.820 --> 00:14:46.260
 'Cause she was typecast as like this sort of matriarchal,

00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:47.900
 African-American mother.

00:14:47.900 --> 00:14:48.740
 - Okay.

00:14:48.740 --> 00:14:52.220
 - And you know that in the Tom and Jerry cartoons,

00:14:52.220 --> 00:14:55.020
 when there's a lady stud that she's going,

00:14:55.020 --> 00:14:56.180
 "Tomas, Thomas!"

00:14:56.180 --> 00:14:57.480
 That's based on her as well.

00:14:57.480 --> 00:14:58.320
 - Is it really?

00:14:58.320 --> 00:15:00.140
 - Yeah, but she won this award.

00:15:00.140 --> 00:15:03.420
 And actually, I think she couldn't go to a lot of parties

00:15:03.420 --> 00:15:06.140
 'cause they were still segregated at the time.

00:15:06.140 --> 00:15:08.660
 But when she won that award, yeah, basically they put her

00:15:08.660 --> 00:15:10.900
 as exactly the same character in everything.

00:15:10.900 --> 00:15:13.700
 - What a shame it's not literally the same character,

00:15:13.700 --> 00:15:17.300
 like combining all these universes of film together.

00:15:17.300 --> 00:15:19.020
 It's one person.

00:15:19.020 --> 00:15:19.860
 - That's amazing.

00:15:19.860 --> 00:15:21.380
 - That's incredible, yeah.

00:15:21.380 --> 00:15:25.340
 - Japan's crown jewels probably don't exist.

00:15:25.340 --> 00:15:27.440
 - Oh. - According to Steve McCabe.

00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:29.060
 (laughing)

00:15:29.060 --> 00:15:30.860
 - And he would know.

00:15:30.860 --> 00:15:35.860
 He says that Japan has three Imperial sacred treasures.

00:15:35.860 --> 00:15:39.020
 And then he lists those.

00:15:39.020 --> 00:15:40.780
 And apparently they're handed over

00:15:40.780 --> 00:15:42.420
 to each new emperor, his coronation,

00:15:42.420 --> 00:15:43.980
 but they've not been seen by anyone

00:15:43.980 --> 00:15:47.140
 outside the Imperial household in centuries.

00:15:47.140 --> 00:15:49.300
 Wikipedia notes that the actual historical status

00:15:49.300 --> 00:15:51.140
 of these legendary treasures is unknown.

00:15:51.140 --> 00:15:53.380
 And they're intentionally kept from public view.

00:15:53.380 --> 00:15:55.580
 So Japan's telling us they're real.

00:15:55.580 --> 00:15:57.060
 We're not allowed to see them.

00:15:57.060 --> 00:15:59.300
 It's not certain where they're kept.

00:15:59.300 --> 00:16:01.940
 And the three treasures are a sword, a mirror,

00:16:01.940 --> 00:16:04.260
 and a jewel with special names.

00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:05.100
 What do we think?

00:16:05.100 --> 00:16:07.460
 - I think that's, there must be lots of things

00:16:07.460 --> 00:16:10.220
 in this country that we don't know where they are.

00:16:10.220 --> 00:16:11.420
 - Yeah, we've never seen. - That we've never seen.

00:16:11.420 --> 00:16:12.980
 - Yeah, they must be right.

00:16:12.980 --> 00:16:13.820
 I don't know what they are.

00:16:13.820 --> 00:16:15.180
 - Head of MI5.

00:16:15.180 --> 00:16:16.540
 - Oh yeah, do they exist?

00:16:16.540 --> 00:16:18.780
 - Oh, you think we have a prop head

00:16:18.780 --> 00:16:20.300
 and there's a secret actual head?

00:16:20.300 --> 00:16:23.060
 - Yeah, I didn't think until you said that,

00:16:23.060 --> 00:16:24.340
 but that's so convincing.

00:16:24.340 --> 00:16:25.900
 - It is when you say it, yeah.

00:16:25.900 --> 00:16:27.860
 - What's the point, 'cause crown jewels are something

00:16:27.860 --> 00:16:29.580
 that's to show off, isn't it?

00:16:29.580 --> 00:16:31.620
 What's the point in having that if no one's allowed to see it?

00:16:31.620 --> 00:16:32.820
 - I wonder if in the olden days,

00:16:32.820 --> 00:16:35.820
 you could leverage against it,

00:16:35.820 --> 00:16:37.740
 borrow stuff from your barons.

00:16:37.740 --> 00:16:39.020
 - I bet you could.

00:16:39.020 --> 00:16:41.220
 - Because I got this really old spoon here.

00:16:41.220 --> 00:16:45.020
 - Isn't that the last bit of the old crown jewels

00:16:45.020 --> 00:16:46.420
 that still survives as a spoon?

00:16:46.420 --> 00:16:48.860
 It's the only one and everything else has been--

00:16:48.860 --> 00:16:50.500
 - It all got lost in the wash, didn't it?

00:16:50.500 --> 00:16:52.580
 - There was the wash and then there was the Civil War.

00:16:52.580 --> 00:16:53.420
 - Not the wash, I'm sorry,

00:16:53.420 --> 00:16:55.380
 which is better if I not in a washing machine.

00:16:55.380 --> 00:16:56.220
 (laughing)

00:16:56.220 --> 00:16:57.060
 - Sorry.

00:16:57.060 --> 00:16:59.260
 - We've totally done two high eight.

00:16:59.260 --> 00:17:00.100
 - Where's the wash again?

00:17:00.100 --> 00:17:00.940
 Is it Lincolnshire?

00:17:00.940 --> 00:17:01.780
 - Off the coast of Norfolk, isn't it?

00:17:01.780 --> 00:17:02.620
 - Oh, it's off the coast.

00:17:02.620 --> 00:17:03.460
 It does a bit--

00:17:03.460 --> 00:17:04.300
 - I don't know, maybe it's Anning Street.

00:17:04.300 --> 00:17:05.660
 - It does a very marshy bit

00:17:05.660 --> 00:17:09.060
 and King John supposedly lost the crown jewels in the wash.

00:17:09.060 --> 00:17:10.660
 Do people still look for it then?

00:17:10.660 --> 00:17:11.500
 - No.

00:17:11.500 --> 00:17:12.340
 - Why not?

00:17:12.340 --> 00:17:13.180
 - I feel like they're not.

00:17:13.180 --> 00:17:14.540
 - If we know a specific location,

00:17:14.540 --> 00:17:18.060
 I think it's probably a bit bigger than is easily searchable.

00:17:18.060 --> 00:17:19.420
 - You're right, there should be detectorists

00:17:19.420 --> 00:17:20.260
 that are really--

00:17:20.260 --> 00:17:21.100
 - I actually thought detectorists,

00:17:21.100 --> 00:17:23.460
 I kind of assumed that was a place where if you went,

00:17:23.460 --> 00:17:25.460
 then you would see lots of detectorists desperately hoping.

00:17:25.460 --> 00:17:27.380
 - Maybe all the detectorists are just assuming

00:17:27.380 --> 00:17:29.140
 that all the other detectorists are going for it

00:17:29.140 --> 00:17:30.420
 and they're like, oh, that's too obvious,

00:17:30.420 --> 00:17:31.740
 I'm gonna look in this field and search.

00:17:31.740 --> 00:17:33.620
 - They're actually poking out of the ground there.

00:17:33.620 --> 00:17:34.460
 (laughing)

00:17:34.460 --> 00:17:36.580
 That could not be easy on a phone.

00:17:36.580 --> 00:17:39.160
 (upbeat music)

00:17:39.160 --> 00:17:46.140
 - Here's one, this is from Eddie Edwards.

00:17:46.140 --> 00:17:48.100
 I was, Edward Edwards.

00:17:48.100 --> 00:17:49.620
 - Fake name, clearly fake, John.

00:17:49.620 --> 00:17:51.620
 - I was listening to your audience fact special

00:17:51.620 --> 00:17:54.140
 and you were talking about that prop nuclear bomb

00:17:54.140 --> 00:17:55.580
 that was too accurate.

00:17:55.580 --> 00:17:58.500
 Well, the fake money used in rush hour two,

00:17:58.500 --> 00:18:00.060
 the second rush hour movie.

00:18:00.060 --> 00:18:01.340
 Thank you, Eddie.

00:18:01.340 --> 00:18:03.900
 (laughing)

00:18:03.900 --> 00:18:06.300
 Was so good that a bunch of people working on the movie

00:18:06.300 --> 00:18:08.420
 spent some on the Vegas strip

00:18:08.420 --> 00:18:10.940
 and the secret service ended up getting involved.

00:18:10.940 --> 00:18:12.500
 It led to a bunch of rules being put in place

00:18:12.500 --> 00:18:14.260
 about prop money going forward.

00:18:14.260 --> 00:18:17.060
 - I remember this 'cause they are incredibly strict now.

00:18:17.060 --> 00:18:19.540
 - Yeah, great scene in the film as well.

00:18:19.540 --> 00:18:21.500
 It's a good film rush hour two.

00:18:21.500 --> 00:18:22.700
 Absolutely decent movie.

00:18:22.700 --> 00:18:23.540
 - Absolutely.

00:18:23.540 --> 00:18:26.860
 - And it ends with this money showering all over the place,

00:18:26.860 --> 00:18:29.820
 you know, the suitcase full of money explodes or whatever.

00:18:29.820 --> 00:18:31.380
 And it's this huge, great room they're in

00:18:31.380 --> 00:18:32.620
 and the money is going absolutely over.

00:18:32.620 --> 00:18:35.420
 So I'm sure a load of people could have just pocketed some.

00:18:35.420 --> 00:18:37.660
 - It's a big thing in films that they worry about on set

00:18:37.660 --> 00:18:38.780
 when they're using a lot of money.

00:18:38.780 --> 00:18:39.780
 And actually, if you look at the money

00:18:39.780 --> 00:18:40.700
 that you have to use in films,

00:18:40.700 --> 00:18:42.580
 it looks absolutely nothing like real money.

00:18:42.580 --> 00:18:45.300
 It's got to be about 1.5 times the size and have,

00:18:45.300 --> 00:18:48.980
 you know, 'cause they've even done ones like British money

00:18:48.980 --> 00:18:50.700
 with kind of a dog instead of the queen on it

00:18:50.700 --> 00:18:51.900
 or weird stuff like that, I think.

00:18:51.900 --> 00:18:53.420
 And they've still said that's too similar

00:18:53.420 --> 00:18:55.220
 that could be passed off as real money.

00:18:55.220 --> 00:18:56.060
 - Very, very rich.

00:18:56.060 --> 00:18:57.900
 - Has to be so different.

00:18:57.900 --> 00:18:59.780
 - Can I cheekily pull off a double now?

00:18:59.780 --> 00:19:01.700
 I just have two thematically very linked ones.

00:19:01.700 --> 00:19:02.540
 - Sure, please.

00:19:02.540 --> 00:19:03.380
 - I thought it might be fun.

00:19:03.380 --> 00:19:04.980
 So Lake Berg writes,

00:19:04.980 --> 00:19:05.980
 "I've come across the following.

00:19:05.980 --> 00:19:07.260
 "Apollonia was a Christian martyr

00:19:07.260 --> 00:19:10.300
 "who had her teeth pulled out as torture in 249 CE.

00:19:10.300 --> 00:19:12.860
 "She later became the patron saint of dentistry.

00:19:12.860 --> 00:19:14.260
 "Unsure how deep-cut this is,

00:19:14.260 --> 00:19:16.020
 "and you've probably looked into saints plenty before,

00:19:16.020 --> 00:19:17.860
 "but I find it funny that she got qualifications

00:19:17.860 --> 00:19:19.460
 "in the technical field of dentistry

00:19:19.460 --> 00:19:21.780
 "by just having her teeth pulled out."

00:19:21.780 --> 00:19:23.660
 I think that's fair, that's a good point.

00:19:23.660 --> 00:19:25.420
 And then, David and Katie write,

00:19:25.420 --> 00:19:27.460
 "Hi, just writing in with a fact in dedication

00:19:27.460 --> 00:19:29.700
 "to our friends Scott and Doris, who've just had a baby."

00:19:29.700 --> 00:19:31.100
 So quite a lot of names flying around,

00:19:31.100 --> 00:19:33.300
 but congratulations, Scott and Doris.

00:19:33.300 --> 00:19:35.740
 And hello, David and Katie, who write,

00:19:35.740 --> 00:19:37.580
 "The phenomenon of babies being born

00:19:37.580 --> 00:19:41.340
 "with teeth already erupted, brackets natal teeth,

00:19:41.340 --> 00:19:44.620
 "has an occurrence of around 0.05%.

00:19:44.620 --> 00:19:47.340
 "In other words, there is approximately one case

00:19:47.340 --> 00:19:50.500
 "every 2,000 births."

00:19:50.500 --> 00:19:52.140
 - Last piece, duh.

00:19:52.140 --> 00:19:54.780
 (all laughing)

00:19:54.780 --> 00:19:57.060
 - How good is that?

00:19:57.060 --> 00:19:58.460
 - NB, yes, it's a bit of a stretch

00:19:58.460 --> 00:20:00.460
 because the prevalence varies between studies,

00:20:00.460 --> 00:20:02.660
 but roughly, roughly,

00:20:02.660 --> 00:20:05.060
 what every 2,000, that's stunning.

00:20:05.060 --> 00:20:06.020
 - That's really good stuff.

00:20:06.020 --> 00:20:06.860
 - Lovely, thank you, David.

00:20:06.860 --> 00:20:08.180
 - You know what I tried to find the other day,

00:20:08.180 --> 00:20:11.100
 and I couldn't, is a picture of a baby skull.

00:20:11.100 --> 00:20:12.900
 You know how babies are born with all their teeth,

00:20:12.900 --> 00:20:15.340
 and then you get photos of baby skulls,

00:20:15.340 --> 00:20:18.060
 which do the rounds where you can see all their adult teeth

00:20:18.060 --> 00:20:20.540
 up in their gums that haven't come down yet.

00:20:20.540 --> 00:20:23.460
 But actually, I'm not convinced that those pictures are real.

00:20:23.460 --> 00:20:26.020
 There's only about two of them floating around,

00:20:26.020 --> 00:20:28.500
 and they don't seem to be very well verified.

00:20:28.500 --> 00:20:30.180
 You know, there was one science writer who tweeted one.

00:20:30.180 --> 00:20:32.020
 So I really want to know if anyone's ever seen

00:20:32.020 --> 00:20:33.860
 an x-ray of a baby's skull.

00:20:33.860 --> 00:20:36.460
 - Yeah, I have a feeling that's not true, that.

00:20:36.460 --> 00:20:38.340
 'Cause I wonder if they're smaller at the time,

00:20:38.340 --> 00:20:40.540
 and then they grow in your head.

00:20:40.540 --> 00:20:42.420
 - We're not saying you're not born with all your teeth.

00:20:42.420 --> 00:20:43.980
 - No, I think you definitely are born

00:20:43.980 --> 00:20:45.900
 with all your teeth, aren't you, and they descend,

00:20:45.900 --> 00:20:47.340
 but maybe they're tiny.

00:20:47.340 --> 00:20:48.940
 - They can't, well, they're not full-size, are they?

00:20:48.940 --> 00:20:50.500
 'Cause you've seen a baby, they're small.

00:20:50.500 --> 00:20:53.180
 The head would be all teeth if they had 32 adult teeth.

00:20:53.180 --> 00:20:54.940
 - In the pictures that they show, the head is all teeth.

00:20:54.940 --> 00:20:56.700
 Like, it's full-size adult teeth,

00:20:56.700 --> 00:21:01.140
 up in the baby's cheek, it's scary shit.

00:21:01.140 --> 00:21:02.500
 And I've believed it for years.

00:21:02.500 --> 00:21:04.220
 So yeah, please if you've seen an x-ray.

00:21:04.220 --> 00:21:06.060
 Yeah, I'm interested that James also thinks maybe it's small.

00:21:06.060 --> 00:21:08.940
 - I think it's not, I think some of those are fake pictures.

00:21:08.940 --> 00:21:11.860
 I believe, I feel like I've heard that, maybe I have.

00:21:11.860 --> 00:21:13.140
 - But how do the teeth get in then?

00:21:13.140 --> 00:21:16.980
 - They sneak in, and the tooth fairy brings them.

00:21:16.980 --> 00:21:20.420
 - I think when you eat more calcium as a baby,

00:21:20.420 --> 00:21:22.820
 for the first seven years of your life,

00:21:22.820 --> 00:21:25.580
 you take in the calcium, and that helps them to grow.

00:21:25.580 --> 00:21:28.060
 The same way that you don't have kneecaps and stuff like that.

00:21:28.060 --> 00:21:30.180
 - Right, and then all the milk gives you all the calcium?

00:21:30.180 --> 00:21:31.180
 - Yeah.

00:21:31.180 --> 00:21:32.180
 - There we go.

00:21:32.180 --> 00:21:33.260
 - I think, I can't really.

00:21:33.260 --> 00:21:34.940
 - Wow, that would be blowing a shit wide open,

00:21:34.940 --> 00:21:38.100
 'cause I've seen that image of a side profile of a baby's girl.

00:21:38.100 --> 00:21:38.940
 - Indeed.

00:21:38.940 --> 00:21:40.580
 - God, that's incredible, it's all tooth.

00:21:40.580 --> 00:21:41.420
 - Yeah, disgusting.

00:21:41.420 --> 00:21:43.220
 - The whole tooth, nothing but the tooth.

00:21:43.220 --> 00:21:44.700
 - It was when I showed that.

00:21:44.700 --> 00:21:45.980
 (laughing)

00:21:45.980 --> 00:21:47.220
 - Jesus.

00:21:47.220 --> 00:21:49.820
 - So anyway, if you know about that stuff,

00:21:49.820 --> 00:21:51.260
 'cause we are speculating a little bit here.

00:21:51.260 --> 00:21:52.820
 - Absolutely, please tell us.

00:21:52.820 --> 00:21:54.580
 - To podcast.qa.com.

00:21:54.580 --> 00:21:57.740
 - This is a fact from Andrew Kirkland,

00:21:57.740 --> 00:21:59.740
 and Tee just says that his favorite fact this week

00:21:59.740 --> 00:22:00.900
 is that according to Wikipedia,

00:22:00.900 --> 00:22:03.620
 the Irish invented whiskey in the 14th century,

00:22:03.620 --> 00:22:04.980
 and then they didn't invent anything else

00:22:04.980 --> 00:22:07.820
 for another 300 years, and.

00:22:07.820 --> 00:22:08.780
 - That's understandable.

00:22:08.780 --> 00:22:09.620
 - He's got a point.

00:22:09.620 --> 00:22:12.980
 - Well, exactly, you've reached your peak, haven't you?

00:22:12.980 --> 00:22:15.780
 And it's true, the Wikipedia page on Irish inventions

00:22:15.780 --> 00:22:17.940
 does have a 14th century section,

00:22:17.940 --> 00:22:19.540
 where they have three inventions.

00:22:19.540 --> 00:22:22.420
 They have the Precursor to Modern Gaelic Football.

00:22:22.420 --> 00:22:26.180
 They have the Northern Reginians Anthem,

00:22:26.180 --> 00:22:28.660
 a huge invention, I think we can all agree,

00:22:28.660 --> 00:22:32.300
 and whiskey, and the next invention is 17th century.

00:22:32.300 --> 00:22:33.140
 - And what was that?

00:22:33.140 --> 00:22:33.980
 - Good point you asked.

00:22:33.980 --> 00:22:37.700
 (all laughing)

00:22:37.700 --> 00:22:39.100
 - You don't know it's the whiskey that did it,

00:22:39.100 --> 00:22:42.020
 it might be the Northern Reginians Anthem, it's so catchy.

00:22:42.020 --> 00:22:44.220
 Everyone was seeing it for the next 300 years.

00:22:44.220 --> 00:22:46.820
 (all laughing)

00:22:46.820 --> 00:22:49.540
 - I have a whiskey related one.

00:22:49.540 --> 00:22:50.380
 - There you are.

00:22:50.380 --> 00:22:52.140
 - Okay, so this is from Chris Patterson,

00:22:52.140 --> 00:22:55.780
 and he thinks that he might be the first outside voice

00:22:55.780 --> 00:22:57.860
 to be ever heard on noses and things of fish.

00:22:57.860 --> 00:22:59.620
 - Chris Patterson, the former governor of Hong Kong.

00:22:59.620 --> 00:23:00.460
 - Sorry, that's Chris.

00:23:00.460 --> 00:23:01.300
 - Chris Patterson.

00:23:01.300 --> 00:23:02.140
 - Yeah, okay.

00:23:02.140 --> 00:23:02.980
 - Carry on.

00:23:02.980 --> 00:23:04.060
 - Maybe his son.

00:23:04.060 --> 00:23:04.900
 - Yes.

00:23:04.900 --> 00:23:08.380
 (all laughing)

00:23:08.380 --> 00:23:09.540
 - Can you remember?

00:23:09.540 --> 00:23:10.380
 So this was someone,

00:23:10.380 --> 00:23:12.620
 we did a live show and this person shouted out.

00:23:12.620 --> 00:23:13.460
 - Okay.

00:23:13.460 --> 00:23:14.300
 - We were in Scandinavia somewhere.

00:23:14.300 --> 00:23:16.380
 Can you remember anyone who shouted out in Scandinavia?

00:23:16.380 --> 00:23:17.220
 - Where did we go?

00:23:17.220 --> 00:23:18.780
 We went Gothenburg, and we went Stockholm.

00:23:18.780 --> 00:23:20.820
 - I think it was in Gothenburg.

00:23:20.820 --> 00:23:21.660
 - Gothenburg.

00:23:21.660 --> 00:23:24.180
 - Oh no, in Stockholm, he says it in the email.

00:23:24.180 --> 00:23:26.540
 - I can't remember.

00:23:26.540 --> 00:23:28.260
 - Did they shout out something other than--

00:23:28.260 --> 00:23:31.220
 - Yeah, so we were discussing cyborgs

00:23:31.220 --> 00:23:33.300
 and asked in the audience if there were any cyborgs

00:23:33.300 --> 00:23:36.740
 in the crowd, and he got to shout out I'm a cyborg.

00:23:36.740 --> 00:23:40.700
 And this is 'cause he had an RFID chip

00:23:40.700 --> 00:23:41.820
 put into his body.

00:23:41.820 --> 00:23:43.660
 You know, like you could get a little chip in your body

00:23:43.660 --> 00:23:46.820
 so you could use it as a credit card or something.

00:23:46.820 --> 00:23:49.460
 Anyway, he never got to tell us the whole story that time,

00:23:49.460 --> 00:23:51.020
 but I've got the whole story here.

00:23:51.020 --> 00:23:53.420
 He went to an event called Chips and Whiskey,

00:23:53.420 --> 00:23:56.740
 thinking that it was potato crisps and alcohol

00:23:56.740 --> 00:23:57.820
 that he was gonna get.

00:23:59.180 --> 00:24:01.820
 But in fact, it was someone giving you these implants,

00:24:01.820 --> 00:24:03.340
 and he said after a few whiskies,

00:24:03.340 --> 00:24:04.700
 it seemed like a good idea,

00:24:04.700 --> 00:24:06.700
 and I got the largest needle I have ever seen

00:24:06.700 --> 00:24:08.540
 injecting a chip into my hand.

00:24:08.540 --> 00:24:13.380
 I've used this as a gym card and not much more.

00:24:13.380 --> 00:24:15.300
 - That's so great.

00:24:15.300 --> 00:24:16.900
 - Do you know what was that guy called?

00:24:16.900 --> 00:24:18.420
 - Chris Patton's son.

00:24:18.420 --> 00:24:19.980
 - Of course.

00:24:19.980 --> 00:24:21.460
 I've always thought those people all got chips

00:24:21.460 --> 00:24:23.980
 and started to kind of card douchebags, to be honest,

00:24:23.980 --> 00:24:27.140
 but that is the best excuse for doing it, I've ever heard.

00:24:27.140 --> 00:24:28.540
 - I almost got one.

00:24:28.540 --> 00:24:30.540
 - Exactly, exactly my point.

00:24:30.540 --> 00:24:32.380
 - Moving on.

00:24:32.380 --> 00:24:33.740
 - Well, I did, years ago,

00:24:33.740 --> 00:24:36.700
 I did this little taster tape that was filmed,

00:24:36.700 --> 00:24:39.940
 whereby it was looking into all of this world of cyborgs,

00:24:39.940 --> 00:24:42.060
 and as part of it, they wanted to put a chip into me,

00:24:42.060 --> 00:24:43.220
 and then right at the last minute,

00:24:43.220 --> 00:24:45.780
 they had someone come in with the device,

00:24:45.780 --> 00:24:49.580
 and the health and safety didn't allow

00:24:49.580 --> 00:24:51.540
 for the chip itself to go in,

00:24:51.540 --> 00:24:54.580
 but they still injected me with the thing to put it in.

00:24:54.580 --> 00:24:56.420
 It's so painful.

00:24:56.420 --> 00:25:00.300
 So I was filmed as the process as if I had the chip in me,

00:25:00.300 --> 00:25:01.140
 and then I had to--

00:25:01.140 --> 00:25:02.020
 - What did they put in there?

00:25:02.020 --> 00:25:03.340
 - Nothing, it was just empty.

00:25:03.340 --> 00:25:04.180
 - So they say.

00:25:04.180 --> 00:25:05.780
 - Yeah, but yeah, they still,

00:25:05.780 --> 00:25:07.780
 and then I had to sit there and pretend

00:25:07.780 --> 00:25:10.300
 that I was turning a lamp on with my hand,

00:25:10.300 --> 00:25:12.660
 and they, like we're talking about with the queen

00:25:12.660 --> 00:25:14.260
 having someone press the button,

00:25:14.260 --> 00:25:16.300
 there was someone on the floor, out of shot,

00:25:16.300 --> 00:25:18.220
 pressing the button of the lamp flickering,

00:25:18.220 --> 00:25:20.980
 as I was going, "Look at me, I'm a cyborg."

00:25:20.980 --> 00:25:24.460
 - Wow, TV is full of lies, isn't it?

00:25:24.460 --> 00:25:26.060
 You and David Attenborough.

00:25:26.060 --> 00:25:27.940
 I just, I can't believe with you, Dan,

00:25:27.940 --> 00:25:29.820
 that however many years I know you,

00:25:29.820 --> 00:25:32.860
 there's always a new anecdote that I've never heard.

00:25:32.860 --> 00:25:33.980
 - I'll do one now.

00:25:33.980 --> 00:25:37.220
 Derek Bailey writes,

00:25:37.220 --> 00:25:39.580
 "I heard the weirdest fact about albatross

00:25:39.580 --> 00:25:41.340
 "that may be fish worthy.

00:25:41.340 --> 00:25:43.580
 "They knew from finding remains of birds

00:25:43.580 --> 00:25:46.740
 "that the main thing that they eat are squid,

00:25:46.740 --> 00:25:49.060
 "but they've never been observed catching them.

00:25:49.060 --> 00:25:52.260
 "They can't dive, so they decided to tag some birds

00:26:06.260 --> 00:26:08.300
 "They went out to see at night to observe.

00:26:08.300 --> 00:26:10.180
 "They found these huge birds swimming around

00:26:10.180 --> 00:26:12.260
 "in tight circles, pulling and pushing

00:26:12.260 --> 00:26:13.860
 "with their large webbed feet.

00:26:13.860 --> 00:26:16.140
 "They were creating phosphorescence,

00:26:16.140 --> 00:26:18.580
 "which was drawing the squid to the surface

00:26:18.580 --> 00:26:20.340
 "and there was their buffet."

00:26:20.340 --> 00:26:21.700
 - Cool. - Lovely.

00:26:21.700 --> 00:26:24.380
 - Like monster flames. - Very cool, Derek Bailey.

00:26:24.380 --> 00:26:26.060
 - How are they creating phosphorescence

00:26:26.060 --> 00:26:27.020
 with their feet, Derek Bailey?

00:26:27.020 --> 00:26:30.740
 - Well, you get those little sort of bacteria and stuff

00:26:30.740 --> 00:26:32.580
 and algae that live in the water

00:26:32.580 --> 00:26:34.620
 and when you move your hands and make waves,

00:26:34.620 --> 00:26:35.660
 they light up. - I see.

00:26:35.660 --> 00:26:36.660
 - You get them in Mexico.

00:26:36.660 --> 00:26:37.500
 - Do you remember that more thing?

00:26:37.500 --> 00:26:40.900
 - The trails of ships can sometimes glow.

00:26:40.900 --> 00:26:42.300
 - Yes, I know, I know, but I didn't realise

00:26:42.300 --> 00:26:43.780
 that another animal who didn't have it

00:26:43.780 --> 00:26:45.500
 could deliberately would swish it up.

00:26:45.500 --> 00:26:46.860
 - Oh, it's just water churning, isn't it?

00:26:46.860 --> 00:26:48.380
 - Yeah, isn't it? - Yeah, very cool.

00:26:48.380 --> 00:26:51.020
 - Actually, 'cause I was walking on a beach in Hobart

00:26:51.020 --> 00:26:52.380
 in Tasmania a couple of years ago,

00:26:52.380 --> 00:26:53.980
 I've never seen anything like it.

00:26:53.980 --> 00:26:56.500
 It was at night time and as you put your foot down

00:26:56.500 --> 00:26:59.260
 on the sand, it glowed fluorescent blue all around you.

00:26:59.260 --> 00:27:01.580
 It was absolutely extraordinary.

00:27:01.580 --> 00:27:02.860
 - Wow, it's like avatar.

00:27:02.860 --> 00:27:03.700
 That's very cool.

00:27:03.700 --> 00:27:04.540
 - Is that what happens in avatar?

00:27:04.540 --> 00:27:05.820
 - I actually can't remember, Andy.

00:27:05.820 --> 00:27:07.060
 - Yeah. - There we go.

00:27:07.060 --> 00:27:09.660
 - It actually reminded me more of those disco pads

00:27:09.660 --> 00:27:12.180
 where if you step on a glowing bit,

00:27:12.180 --> 00:27:13.380
 a bit glows and you step on it.

00:27:13.380 --> 00:27:16.620
 - Those dance machines, I used to love those things.

00:27:16.620 --> 00:27:18.300
 Oh my God, I used to love them so much.

00:27:18.300 --> 00:27:19.140
 - Oh, they're good.

00:27:19.140 --> 00:27:20.100
 I still do the occasional dance.

00:27:20.100 --> 00:27:21.940
 - Yeah, if I'm passing an arcade.

00:27:21.940 --> 00:27:24.260
 - God, is that right?

00:27:24.260 --> 00:27:26.300
 'Cause I find them very exhausting.

00:27:26.300 --> 00:27:27.380
 - Oh, the tiring, yeah.

00:27:27.380 --> 00:27:29.540
 - I guess probably you're a bit younger than me, but yeah.

00:27:29.540 --> 00:27:30.380
 - Well, no, it's tiring.

00:27:30.380 --> 00:27:32.620
 - How do you, was it, you both still do dance?

00:27:32.620 --> 00:27:34.820
 - No, I haven't done it for years, no.

00:27:34.820 --> 00:27:37.180
 But like, would you hold onto the bars when you did it

00:27:37.180 --> 00:27:38.780
 or were you like hardcore?

00:27:38.780 --> 00:27:40.980
 - No, I don't think I do.

00:27:40.980 --> 00:27:42.800
 - Is that like having the walls up in Berlin?

00:27:42.800 --> 00:27:44.820
 (all laughing)

00:27:44.820 --> 00:27:45.660
 - Exactly.

00:27:45.660 --> 00:27:48.060
 - When's the last time you did it, Andy?

00:27:48.060 --> 00:27:49.700
 - I would say within the last year.

00:27:49.700 --> 00:27:51.860
 - On your own, walking past an arcade.

00:27:51.860 --> 00:27:53.260
 - With my wife.

00:27:53.260 --> 00:27:54.860
 We went to a video game arcade.

00:27:54.860 --> 00:27:55.700
 - Okay, that's different.

00:27:55.700 --> 00:27:58.060
 - Did you do it where you were like on the same team?

00:27:58.060 --> 00:27:59.460
 - She didn't participate.

00:27:59.460 --> 00:28:01.220
 (all laughing)

00:28:01.220 --> 00:28:02.700
 She didn't want to.

00:28:02.700 --> 00:28:04.660
 She said, "I'll just watch you, darling."

00:28:04.660 --> 00:28:06.260
 - I want you to take on that nine-year-old.

00:28:06.260 --> 00:28:08.660
 (all laughing)

00:28:08.660 --> 00:28:09.500
 - Yeah.

00:28:09.500 --> 00:28:10.340
 - No, it was really fun.

00:28:10.340 --> 00:28:11.180
 It was really fun.

00:28:11.180 --> 00:28:12.020
 It was a video game bar.

00:28:12.020 --> 00:28:14.180
 A video game sort of bar slash arcade thing.

00:28:14.180 --> 00:28:15.540
 I wasn't drinking obviously, but.

00:28:15.540 --> 00:28:18.660
 - No, your wife ordered three large vodkas at the bar.

00:28:19.620 --> 00:28:21.220
 - Do you guys remember that great story

00:28:21.220 --> 00:28:23.620
 about Jim Lovell from Apollo 13?

00:28:23.620 --> 00:28:27.420
 So obviously the story of Apollo 13 is insane.

00:28:27.420 --> 00:28:29.500
 They break down in space on the way to the moon.

00:28:29.500 --> 00:28:30.340
 They need to get back.

00:28:30.340 --> 00:28:32.260
 But he had a situation back on Earth

00:28:32.260 --> 00:28:35.300
 when he was a fighter pilot that was equally as dangerous.

00:28:35.300 --> 00:28:38.140
 He was on his plane over the sea, got lost

00:28:38.140 --> 00:28:41.380
 and managed last minute to find his way back

00:28:41.380 --> 00:28:42.380
 to the ship to land on

00:28:42.380 --> 00:28:44.620
 because he followed the trail of phosphorescence

00:28:44.620 --> 00:28:46.460
 that was being left in the wake of the ship.

00:28:46.460 --> 00:28:47.660
 - I thought that was what you were referencing.

00:28:47.660 --> 00:28:50.380
 Yeah, it was when he was landing on aircraft carrier,

00:28:50.380 --> 00:28:51.220
 wasn't he?

00:28:51.220 --> 00:28:52.060
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:28:52.060 --> 00:28:52.900
 - Yeah.

00:28:52.900 --> 00:28:53.740
 - Astonishing, very cool.

00:28:53.740 --> 00:28:55.780
 So where did the dance mat fit into that?

00:28:55.780 --> 00:28:56.620
 (all laughing)

00:28:56.620 --> 00:28:57.780
 Once he got out.

00:28:57.780 --> 00:29:00.780
 (all laughing)

00:29:00.780 --> 00:29:01.620
 All right, here's one.

00:29:01.620 --> 00:29:04.180
 Alexis Beckett from British Columbia.

00:29:04.180 --> 00:29:05.660
 I'm a long time listener.

00:29:05.660 --> 00:29:06.740
 I've never written him before,

00:29:06.740 --> 00:29:07.580
 but for some reason,

00:29:07.580 --> 00:29:10.500
 Andy Demarney we do persuaded me this Saturday afternoon.

00:29:10.500 --> 00:29:11.340
 Hmm, I think.

00:29:11.340 --> 00:29:13.100
 I had nothing good to say.

00:29:13.100 --> 00:29:14.020
 (all laughing)

00:29:14.020 --> 00:29:15.980
 - Welcome to the podcast recording mate.

00:29:15.980 --> 00:29:17.140
 (all laughing)

00:29:17.140 --> 00:29:18.620
 So I reached for a weird fact.

00:29:18.620 --> 00:29:20.660
 I remember being told in high school,

00:29:20.660 --> 00:29:24.020
 in the Yukon, it's illegal to push a moose

00:29:24.020 --> 00:29:26.100
 from an airplane in flight.

00:29:26.100 --> 00:29:27.980
 It's also illegal to watch a moose

00:29:27.980 --> 00:29:29.980
 be pushed from an airplane in flight.

00:29:29.980 --> 00:29:31.980
 I'm not certain whether this is accurate,

00:29:31.980 --> 00:29:33.660
 but I've always found it entertaining

00:29:33.660 --> 00:29:34.740
 and we shouldn't let the truth

00:29:34.740 --> 00:29:36.460
 get in the way of a good story.

00:29:36.460 --> 00:29:37.700
 Thank you, Alexis.

00:29:37.700 --> 00:29:38.940
 - That feels a bit cheat, right?

00:29:38.940 --> 00:29:40.220
 - Yeah, I don't know, Andy.

00:29:40.220 --> 00:29:41.740
 That doesn't sound true.

00:29:41.740 --> 00:29:44.300
 - It would be hard to prosecute people who've watched it.

00:29:44.300 --> 00:29:47.460
 Now the prosecution is gonna bring in some witnesses.

00:29:47.460 --> 00:29:50.040
 (all laughing)

00:29:50.040 --> 00:29:54.060
 - Yeah, okay.

00:29:54.060 --> 00:29:55.220
 No, it's almost certainly nonsense, isn't it?

00:29:55.220 --> 00:29:56.060
 Thank you Alexis, regardless.

00:29:56.060 --> 00:29:57.340
 - Yeah, it doesn't feel like it.

00:29:57.340 --> 00:29:58.380
 - Nice try.

00:29:58.380 --> 00:30:00.820
 From James Milne, everyone knows he says,

00:30:00.820 --> 00:30:02.220
 and I think he's correct,

00:30:02.220 --> 00:30:05.580
 that Oslo gifts a tree to London for Christmas every year,

00:30:05.580 --> 00:30:07.900
 which it does, has done since World War II.

00:30:07.900 --> 00:30:09.020
 But James Milne says,

00:30:09.020 --> 00:30:11.420
 it's not the only tree gifted to a British city

00:30:11.420 --> 00:30:13.020
 from a Norwegian city.

00:30:13.020 --> 00:30:13.860
 And I didn't know this.

00:30:13.860 --> 00:30:17.340
 The city of Bergen gifts a tree to Newcastle every year as well.

00:30:17.340 --> 00:30:19.700
 Also in recognition of World War II.

00:30:19.700 --> 00:30:24.100
 And it's because Oslo started gifting London this tree,

00:30:24.100 --> 00:30:26.380
 and other parts of Norway wanted to recognise

00:30:26.380 --> 00:30:27.460
 it wasn't just London.

00:30:27.460 --> 00:30:30.340
 It was the whole of the UK that contributed to World War II.

00:30:30.340 --> 00:30:32.380
 And so actually there were quite a lot of cities in the UK

00:30:32.380 --> 00:30:34.060
 that get free trees from Norway.

00:30:34.060 --> 00:30:38.620
 There's Grimsbury, Edinburgh, Orkney, Shetland.

00:30:38.620 --> 00:30:40.100
 - Grimsby.

00:30:40.100 --> 00:30:40.940
 - What did I say?

00:30:40.940 --> 00:30:41.780
 - Grimsbury.

00:30:41.780 --> 00:30:42.620
 - Grimsbury.

00:30:42.620 --> 00:30:43.460
 - Grimsbury.

00:30:43.460 --> 00:30:44.900
 - That's a local cheese limit.

00:30:44.900 --> 00:30:47.140
 (laughing)

00:30:47.140 --> 00:30:50.300
 - That is a really good fact.

00:30:50.300 --> 00:30:51.300
 - Yeah, I can know that.

00:30:51.300 --> 00:30:53.820
 - It also is, people always complain

00:30:53.820 --> 00:30:55.380
 about the Trafalgar Square Tree,

00:30:55.380 --> 00:30:58.140
 because it's this particular kind of coniferous tree

00:30:58.140 --> 00:30:59.620
 that the Norwegians send over.

00:30:59.620 --> 00:31:01.100
 And it doesn't look as glossy

00:31:01.100 --> 00:31:03.300
 as some of the really thick branched trees.

00:31:03.300 --> 00:31:04.820
 People say, "Oh, it looks so scraggy."

00:31:04.820 --> 00:31:05.860
 And you just think, "Learn some history."

00:31:05.860 --> 00:31:06.700
 You know, it's the--

00:31:06.700 --> 00:31:10.100
 - But I also think they put some not very good lights on it.

00:31:10.100 --> 00:31:11.420
 You know, like when you do your tree,

00:31:11.420 --> 00:31:13.420
 you put like baubles in really nice places.

00:31:13.420 --> 00:31:14.940
 You've got tinsel all the way around.

00:31:14.940 --> 00:31:16.620
 They just kind of hang it from the top,

00:31:16.620 --> 00:31:17.820
 these sort of lights coming down.

00:31:17.820 --> 00:31:19.140
 - They just do some strings down, don't they?

00:31:19.140 --> 00:31:20.300
 - Yes, I think it looks crap.

00:31:20.300 --> 00:31:21.300
 - That's probably us, though.

00:31:21.300 --> 00:31:22.260
 I'm sure we do the lights.

00:31:22.260 --> 00:31:24.500
 - Oh yeah, I'm not playing in the Norwegians for that.

00:31:24.500 --> 00:31:26.740
 But I just think they don't help themselves.

00:31:26.740 --> 00:31:28.300
 - Yeah, I've always thought that.

00:31:28.300 --> 00:31:30.020
 You've got to embed the lights.

00:31:30.020 --> 00:31:31.500
 They're not for draping.

00:31:31.500 --> 00:31:32.340
 - Yeah.

00:31:32.340 --> 00:31:33.180
 - It's mad.

00:31:33.180 --> 00:31:34.300
 - Probably a health and safety thing.

00:31:34.300 --> 00:31:36.900
 Just on war thanks things,

00:31:36.900 --> 00:31:40.220
 when we were on tour in Australia,

00:31:40.220 --> 00:31:41.580
 not so long ago,

00:31:41.580 --> 00:31:43.620
 we went to Melbourne,

00:31:43.620 --> 00:31:46.540
 and I had a day of sightseeing before the show,

00:31:46.540 --> 00:31:50.260
 and Melbourne has a present that the British provided

00:31:50.260 --> 00:31:53.860
 in thanks for years of support during total war.

00:31:53.860 --> 00:31:56.660
 Britain gave Australia a small model village.

00:31:56.660 --> 00:31:57.500
 - Really?

00:31:57.500 --> 00:31:59.340
 - Yeah, and you can walk around it now.

00:31:59.340 --> 00:32:00.180
 - That's fantastic.

00:32:00.180 --> 00:32:01.020
 Of what village?

00:32:01.020 --> 00:32:01.860
 - Which village, yeah.

00:32:01.860 --> 00:32:02.700
 - It's a generic village.

00:32:02.700 --> 00:32:04.660
 So there's, you know, the Shakespeare Arms Pub,

00:32:04.660 --> 00:32:06.100
 and there's a little post office.

00:32:06.100 --> 00:32:07.300
 But honestly, you go there and you think,

00:32:07.300 --> 00:32:09.060
 this is not a good thank you present

00:32:09.060 --> 00:32:11.460
 after quite a lot of sacrifice.

00:32:11.460 --> 00:32:14.460
 - Well, everyone loves a model village.

00:32:14.460 --> 00:32:15.300
 - Yeah.

00:32:15.300 --> 00:32:16.140
 - Yeah.

00:32:16.140 --> 00:32:17.620
 What's an appropriate thank you for you.

00:32:17.620 --> 00:32:19.660
 After six years of support during total war,

00:32:19.660 --> 00:32:21.220
 I'm trying to dance that.

00:32:21.220 --> 00:32:24.620
 That's a good point.

00:32:24.620 --> 00:32:26.420
 Maybe Melbourne really wanted a model village.

00:32:26.420 --> 00:32:27.260
 But it's very sweet.

00:32:27.260 --> 00:32:28.380
 It's really sweet.

00:32:28.380 --> 00:32:29.980
 If you're anywhere near Melbourne,

00:32:29.980 --> 00:32:30.820
 you've got to check it out.

00:32:30.820 --> 00:32:32.140
 - That is quite strange.

00:32:32.140 --> 00:32:32.980
 What was it?

00:32:32.980 --> 00:32:34.460
 Do you remember that thing where there was a gift exchange

00:32:34.460 --> 00:32:36.500
 between Gordon Brown and Barack Obama?

00:32:36.500 --> 00:32:38.420
 And Barack Obama like?

00:32:38.420 --> 00:32:40.820
 - Gordon Brown gave Barack Obama an incredibly beautiful,

00:32:40.820 --> 00:32:43.340
 I think it was a pen holder carved from the wood

00:32:43.340 --> 00:32:46.580
 of an anti-slaving ship after Britain outlawed slavery

00:32:46.580 --> 00:32:49.100
 and was cracking down on the illegal slave trade.

00:32:49.100 --> 00:32:50.540
 So it's very symbolic.

00:32:50.540 --> 00:32:53.660
 And Obama gave Gordon Brown a bag of DVD.

00:32:53.660 --> 00:32:55.820
 - A shower too, I think.

00:32:55.820 --> 00:32:57.180
 - Which were in the wrong zone

00:32:57.180 --> 00:32:59.420
 to be played on British DVD players.

00:32:59.420 --> 00:33:00.980
 A golden age of translates.

00:33:00.980 --> 00:33:02.500
 Obama's one misstep, I'd say.

00:33:02.500 --> 00:33:04.140
 - Yeah, absolutely.

00:33:04.140 --> 00:33:06.860
 Just actually, can I say it on war related gifts?

00:33:06.860 --> 00:33:11.380
 - Gernica, the battle started by Pablo Picasso.

00:33:11.380 --> 00:33:15.540
 - Just so that he had something to paint.

00:33:15.540 --> 00:33:17.020
 - Exactly, you know.

00:33:17.020 --> 00:33:19.820
 You've got to create your material sometimes.

00:33:19.820 --> 00:33:22.500
 No, Gernica was a battle in the Spanish Civil War.

00:33:22.500 --> 00:33:24.380
 The Spanish right wing side had a lot of help

00:33:24.380 --> 00:33:26.860
 from fellow fascists from Italy and Germany.

00:33:26.860 --> 00:33:29.020
 And the reason the Nazis got involved

00:33:29.020 --> 00:33:33.580
 was because it was a birthday present to Hitler

00:33:33.580 --> 00:33:35.500
 from the head of the Luftwaffe

00:33:35.500 --> 00:33:37.340
 who I think was it going?

00:33:37.340 --> 00:33:39.380
 It was going, had a Luftwaffe.

00:33:39.380 --> 00:33:40.420
 Yeah, so it was a happy birthday.

00:33:40.420 --> 00:33:41.740
 And actually it really fucked up

00:33:41.740 --> 00:33:43.540
 because the weather screwed it up.

00:33:43.540 --> 00:33:45.500
 So it had to be delayed by about five days.

00:33:45.500 --> 00:33:46.980
 So if you look at the dates of Hitler's birthday

00:33:46.980 --> 00:33:48.540
 and the dates of Gernica,

00:33:48.540 --> 00:33:49.500
 they were five days late,

00:33:49.500 --> 00:33:50.980
 but apparently Hitler was very understanding about that.

00:33:50.980 --> 00:33:53.460
 - Yeah, I mean, sometimes you can't have your birthday party

00:33:53.460 --> 00:33:54.820
 on the day of your birthday, can you?

00:33:54.820 --> 00:33:56.380
 - Exactly, you've got to wait till the weekend.

00:33:56.380 --> 00:33:57.500
 - It's on a Tuesday.

00:33:57.500 --> 00:34:01.220
 That's a callback to last week's show.

00:34:01.220 --> 00:34:04.300
 - The Luftwaffe's involvement in a battle

00:34:04.300 --> 00:34:05.700
 was a birthday present.

00:34:05.700 --> 00:34:07.020
 - Yeah, because I think Gary knew

00:34:07.020 --> 00:34:08.580
 that Hitler would be really pleased.

00:34:08.580 --> 00:34:10.220
 And it was like a surprise.

00:34:10.220 --> 00:34:11.100
 You know, I decided to get it built.

00:34:11.100 --> 00:34:12.420
 - Did they arrive in a giant cake?

00:34:12.420 --> 00:34:13.260
 - They came out of a cake.

00:34:13.260 --> 00:34:14.100
 - They came out of a cake.

00:34:14.100 --> 00:34:16.260
 - Yeah, flew out of a cake, yeah.

00:34:16.260 --> 00:34:19.020
 - Here's a fact from Mark Weiberd,

00:34:19.020 --> 00:34:21.380
 after whom the play bus stop is named.

00:34:21.380 --> 00:34:24.460
 That's a bit of a niche one.

00:34:24.460 --> 00:34:25.940
 People of a certain age.

00:34:25.940 --> 00:34:27.820
 There was a kid's show called Play Bus

00:34:27.820 --> 00:34:29.180
 and they had the Weiberd stop.

00:34:29.180 --> 00:34:32.060
 Anyway, Mark Weiberd says,

00:34:32.060 --> 00:34:34.980
 "There is a recently completed Australian legal case

00:34:34.980 --> 00:34:37.860
 "establishing an important legal principle

00:34:37.860 --> 00:34:40.420
 "that is called Tickle versus Giggle."

00:34:40.420 --> 00:34:42.700
 - Come on.

00:34:42.700 --> 00:34:44.580
 - He says, "It is important and serious

00:34:44.580 --> 00:34:46.580
 "for reasons of establishing trans rights,

00:34:46.580 --> 00:34:50.140
 "but it is purely the name that makes me smile."

00:34:50.140 --> 00:34:51.140
 - Do we get any more details?

00:34:51.140 --> 00:34:53.300
 Or is it like, details too dry and serious?

00:34:53.300 --> 00:34:54.300
 Name, very funny.

00:34:54.300 --> 00:34:55.500
 - I don't have any more details.

00:34:55.500 --> 00:34:57.100
 It feels like it would be dry and serious.

00:34:57.100 --> 00:34:58.300
 But Tickle versus Giggle.

00:34:58.300 --> 00:34:59.740
 - Tickle versus Giggle, lovely.

00:34:59.740 --> 00:35:02.460
 - I wonder who's the good guy there, Tickle or Giggle?

00:35:02.460 --> 00:35:03.300
 - Tickle.

00:35:03.300 --> 00:35:05.700
 - Gotta be Giggle, Tickle is a bad guy always, right?

00:35:05.700 --> 00:35:07.020
 - Mr. Tickle.

00:35:07.020 --> 00:35:08.340
 - Yeah, no one likes being tickled.

00:35:08.340 --> 00:35:09.740
 - He's a good guy.

00:35:09.740 --> 00:35:11.260
 He's misunderstood.

00:35:11.260 --> 00:35:12.500
 - What about John Tickle,

00:35:12.500 --> 00:35:16.060
 the ex-big brother housemate who then went on

00:35:16.060 --> 00:35:18.500
 to do gadget shows?

00:35:18.500 --> 00:35:19.340
 - Yes.

00:35:19.340 --> 00:35:20.780
 - There's quite a lot of amazing niche references

00:35:20.780 --> 00:35:21.620
 coming in one.

00:35:21.620 --> 00:35:25.420
 - I reckon AI could just listen to me

00:35:25.420 --> 00:35:27.260
 in the last 10 minutes and work out exactly

00:35:27.260 --> 00:35:30.860
 when I was born, but John Tickle.

00:35:30.860 --> 00:35:32.860
 - John Tickle, I always remember what I liked.

00:35:32.860 --> 00:35:35.740
 I think this was his first so-called invention

00:35:35.740 --> 00:35:37.620
 after big brother was the toaster.

00:35:37.620 --> 00:35:39.460
 Do you remember the toaster that delays

00:35:39.460 --> 00:35:40.300
 the second bit of toast?

00:35:40.300 --> 00:35:42.100
 So you put it down, but it doesn't start cooking

00:35:42.100 --> 00:35:44.100
 the second bit of toast until your first one's ready.

00:35:44.100 --> 00:35:45.340
 Very sensible.

00:35:45.340 --> 00:35:46.460
 I don't know, 'cause you're always gonna deal

00:35:46.460 --> 00:35:48.340
 with the second cold bit of toast.

00:35:48.340 --> 00:35:49.180
 - Yes.

00:35:49.180 --> 00:35:50.020
 - Where is he now?

00:35:50.020 --> 00:35:50.860
 - Where is he?

00:35:50.860 --> 00:35:51.700
 - John Tickle.

00:35:51.700 --> 00:35:53.300
 - Well, you can retire after that toast moment, can't you?

00:35:53.300 --> 00:35:54.140
 - Really?

00:35:54.140 --> 00:35:55.700
 - 'Cause we've all got one now.

00:35:55.700 --> 00:35:57.700
 We've really shaken off any international listeners,

00:35:57.700 --> 00:35:58.540
 I think.

00:35:58.540 --> 00:36:07.540
 - I've got one here from Nina de Villiers.

00:36:07.540 --> 00:36:09.660
 Long time listener of the podcast.

00:36:09.660 --> 00:36:11.740
 I used to work on seahorses.

00:36:11.740 --> 00:36:14.300
 - On seahorses.

00:36:14.300 --> 00:36:17.100
 - Very, very small wet grad national.

00:36:17.100 --> 00:36:18.500
 - That's how I broke my hymen.

00:36:18.500 --> 00:36:25.580
 - In South Africa, actually, I should say,

00:36:25.580 --> 00:36:26.580
 how would you pronounce that?

00:36:26.580 --> 00:36:27.620
 - Ooh.

00:36:27.620 --> 00:36:28.460
 - South Africa.

00:36:28.460 --> 00:36:35.380
 - I wouldn't, I'd guess canizna, I think.

00:36:35.380 --> 00:36:36.220
 - Okay, canizna.

00:36:36.220 --> 00:36:37.980
 So I used to work on seahorses and canizna,

00:36:37.980 --> 00:36:39.500
 and a while back, I learned from a colleague

00:36:39.500 --> 00:36:41.860
 that seahorses make vocalizations.

00:36:41.860 --> 00:36:45.100
 They make clicking noises during courtship and feeding,

00:36:45.100 --> 00:36:47.420
 but they also growl to startle predators.

00:36:47.420 --> 00:36:49.700
 This is followed by quivering their bodies.

00:36:49.700 --> 00:36:51.940
 At one point, there was research investigating seahorses

00:36:51.940 --> 00:36:54.440
 to determine where the sound were produced.

00:36:54.440 --> 00:36:56.860
 I briefly got involved by taking a dried seahorse

00:36:56.860 --> 00:36:58.780
 to be scanned at our local hospital

00:36:58.780 --> 00:37:00.740
 in the X-ray and CT machine.

00:37:00.740 --> 00:37:02.660
 Other than a very cool looking scan,

00:37:02.660 --> 00:37:04.900
 where you could see all of its baby teeth.

00:37:04.900 --> 00:37:07.220
 (all laughing)

00:37:07.220 --> 00:37:09.800
 I'm not actually sure it helped the researcher.

00:37:09.800 --> 00:37:12.020
 But she took it, yeah.

00:37:12.020 --> 00:37:14.140
 - But it did help the hospital waiting list,

00:37:14.140 --> 00:37:16.020
 the queue of ambulances outside,

00:37:16.020 --> 00:37:18.820
 waiting for you to scan your seahorse.

00:37:18.820 --> 00:37:21.320
 - This is a very recondite one, I love it.

00:37:21.320 --> 00:37:24.380
 It's from Isabelle Starling, in relation to Mark Weibert.

00:37:24.380 --> 00:37:28.740
 Something fun I heard the other day.

00:37:28.740 --> 00:37:31.340
 William Jones, the man generally credited

00:37:31.340 --> 00:37:33.820
 with the use of the Greek letter pi

00:37:33.820 --> 00:37:37.900
 for the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter,

00:37:37.900 --> 00:37:41.820
 was the father of William Jones, another William Jones,

00:37:41.820 --> 00:37:43.860
 one of the first to suggest the existence

00:37:43.860 --> 00:37:48.860
 of the Proto-Indo-European language known as pi.

00:37:48.860 --> 00:37:51.120
 - Oh, very good. - In no way!

00:37:51.120 --> 00:37:52.480
 - How good is that?

00:37:52.480 --> 00:37:54.760
 - Hang on, is that a coincidence?

00:37:54.760 --> 00:37:56.200
 What, is it one of the names after the other?

00:37:56.200 --> 00:37:57.840
 - No, it looks like a--

00:37:57.840 --> 00:37:59.200
 - 'Cause why do we call pi pi?

00:37:59.200 --> 00:38:00.120
 - Because after the letter.

00:38:00.120 --> 00:38:02.160
 - Just the letter, that's just how far we've got.

00:38:02.160 --> 00:38:05.080
 'Cause you don't hear all the alpha to--

00:38:05.080 --> 00:38:07.760
 - No, there is a reason, there is a reason.

00:38:07.760 --> 00:38:08.760
 I can't remember what it is.

00:38:08.760 --> 00:38:10.080
 - Yeah. - Wow, that's amazing.

00:38:10.080 --> 00:38:12.200
 - I think that's a cracking fact, thank you, Isabelle.

00:38:12.200 --> 00:38:13.360
 She finishes her email.

00:38:13.360 --> 00:38:15.240
 I also discovered that Shirley Ballas'

00:38:15.240 --> 00:38:17.800
 ex-father-in-law invented the strimmer.

00:38:17.800 --> 00:38:20.060
 Although I suspect that one is only interesting to me.

00:38:20.060 --> 00:38:21.660
 - Yeah, I like it.

00:38:21.660 --> 00:38:23.500
 - Yeah, and for international listeners,

00:38:23.500 --> 00:38:25.300
 Shirley, I can't explain Shirley Ballas.

00:38:25.300 --> 00:38:29.060
 - There's no one left, there is no international listener left.

00:38:29.060 --> 00:38:30.860
 - I don't know who that is, so please.

00:38:30.860 --> 00:38:31.700
 - She's on strictly.

00:38:31.700 --> 00:38:32.900
 - Former dancer.

00:38:32.900 --> 00:38:35.780
 - Got it, asking if Shirley Bassie, got it.

00:38:35.780 --> 00:38:36.620
 All right.

00:38:36.620 --> 00:38:39.420
 This is from a guy called Matt Lowry.

00:38:39.420 --> 00:38:42.540
 A new pre-print by some folks at the University of Pennsylvania

00:38:42.540 --> 00:38:44.220
 claims we can use resus macaques

00:38:44.220 --> 00:38:46.260
 to predict the winner of elections.

00:38:46.260 --> 00:38:48.440
 And it's a pretty interesting discussion

00:38:48.440 --> 00:38:51.960
 about behavioral neuro-economics, is it now?

00:38:51.960 --> 00:38:54.520
 But it's basically judging on how long

00:38:54.520 --> 00:38:56.400
 they look at each candidate.

00:38:56.400 --> 00:39:01.960
 He also says that the area of behavioral neuro-economics

00:39:01.960 --> 00:39:04.760
 is a field in a bit of crisis at the moment.

00:39:04.760 --> 00:39:06.920
 So I think actually, 'cause he works in that field,

00:39:06.920 --> 00:39:08.720
 he's just angling for some funding.

00:39:08.720 --> 00:39:11.240
 But there you go, how long a resus macaque

00:39:11.240 --> 00:39:12.800
 looks at a candidate?

00:39:12.800 --> 00:39:14.200
 I guess it must mean they're more likely to win,

00:39:14.200 --> 00:39:15.280
 although he doesn't specify.

00:39:15.280 --> 00:39:19.380
 - So do you reckon if you want to be president,

00:39:19.380 --> 00:39:21.940
 if you sell a table load of bananas to your face,

00:39:21.940 --> 00:39:23.160
 (all laughing)

00:39:23.160 --> 00:39:24.380
 that gives you more of a chance?

00:39:24.380 --> 00:39:25.220
 - That'll do it.

00:39:25.220 --> 00:39:26.540
 (all laughing)

00:39:26.540 --> 00:39:28.900
 - I can think of a conch, he's all right with mine, yeah.

00:39:28.900 --> 00:39:31.640
 - We've seen worse candidates, that's all I'm saying.

00:39:31.640 --> 00:39:33.940
 - Meanwhile, the Swedish minister of equality's going,

00:39:33.940 --> 00:39:34.780
 "No!"

00:39:34.780 --> 00:39:37.220
 (all laughing)

00:39:37.220 --> 00:39:39.420
 - Two week call, like, lovely.

00:39:39.420 --> 00:39:41.900
 (all laughing)

00:39:41.900 --> 00:39:43.300
 - He, oh well, here we go.

00:39:43.300 --> 00:39:46.160
 He says, so the paper's filled with a number of amusing quotes,

00:39:46.160 --> 00:39:47.880
 such as, "Here we show that resus macaques

00:39:47.880 --> 00:39:50.280
 "who have no knowledge about political candidates,

00:39:50.280 --> 00:39:53.760
 "all their policies implicitly predict the outcome."

00:39:53.760 --> 00:39:55.680
 Why would they predict the outcome?

00:39:55.680 --> 00:39:56.520
 - So is it different though,

00:39:56.520 --> 00:39:58.640
 when they do understand their policies?

00:39:58.640 --> 00:40:00.160
 - If they've read the manifesto,

00:40:00.160 --> 00:40:03.440
 then yeah, it does change their responses.

00:40:03.440 --> 00:40:05.380
 "Implicitly predict the outcomes of U.S.

00:40:05.380 --> 00:40:07.320
 "a gubernatorial and senatorial elections

00:40:07.320 --> 00:40:09.280
 "based solely on visual features,

00:40:09.280 --> 00:40:12.320
 "and our findings have implications for political campaigns,

00:40:12.320 --> 00:40:14.740
 "which should strategically use photos emphasizing

00:40:14.740 --> 00:40:18.220
 "or de-emphasizing jaw width and cheekbone width."

00:40:18.220 --> 00:40:19.060
 I don't know which they prefer,

00:40:19.060 --> 00:40:20.000
 he doesn't say which they prefer.

00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:21.660
 - Oh, wide or narrow, draw bones.

00:40:21.660 --> 00:40:24.520
 Oh, probably wide, nice wide cheekbones, you know.

00:40:24.520 --> 00:40:27.960
 - Wide jaw, gotta be, yeah.

00:40:27.960 --> 00:40:30.840
 Well done macaques, let's just get them to vote.

00:40:30.840 --> 00:40:33.060
 - Isabella Remet writes,

00:40:33.060 --> 00:40:35.660
 "At the Gothenburg Universium,

00:40:35.660 --> 00:40:38.100
 "we support mantle of universe and museum,

00:40:38.100 --> 00:40:40.340
 "and which I went to when we were in Gothenburg,

00:40:40.340 --> 00:40:42.440
 "text messages are sent to the sharks

00:40:42.440 --> 00:40:43.840
 "so they don't get scared

00:40:43.840 --> 00:40:46.900
 "when the nearby train tunnel under construction

00:40:46.900 --> 00:40:49.140
 "blasts in the rock."

00:40:49.140 --> 00:40:49.980
 - Aw.

00:40:49.980 --> 00:40:51.480
 - So they've got a warning text,

00:40:51.480 --> 00:40:52.820
 like when someone comes around the cafe saying,

00:40:52.820 --> 00:40:55.400
 "We're doing a fire alarm, it's just an alarm."

00:40:55.400 --> 00:40:57.820
 - Like when the government sends you a message saying,

00:40:57.820 --> 00:40:59.360
 "This is a test alert."

00:40:59.360 --> 00:41:03.960
 Honestly, it's fine, there's no nuclear weapons on the way.

00:41:03.960 --> 00:41:05.120
 It's just a test.

00:41:05.120 --> 00:41:06.680
 - I mean, we've obviously got no more to go on here,

00:41:06.680 --> 00:41:09.240
 but I wonder what the text says.

00:41:09.240 --> 00:41:11.460
 (all laughing)

00:41:11.460 --> 00:41:14.020
 Probably in Swedish, who says da-da.

00:41:14.020 --> 00:41:16.380
 (all laughing)

00:41:16.380 --> 00:41:18.500
 And also would you not get, if I was a shark,

00:41:18.500 --> 00:41:20.300
 I would think a text message would scare me quite a bit.

00:41:20.300 --> 00:41:21.620
 - That would be very scary, yeah, yeah.

00:41:21.620 --> 00:41:23.980
 - I just don't work on the water phones, do they?

00:41:23.980 --> 00:41:25.780
 - You get these really cool packets

00:41:25.780 --> 00:41:28.340
 so you can put them in now with a pouch.

00:41:28.340 --> 00:41:29.180
 - Yeah.

00:41:29.180 --> 00:41:30.860
 - I mean, I keep my genitals in mind,

00:41:30.860 --> 00:41:32.860
 but that's for a time as well.

00:41:32.860 --> 00:41:36.020
 (all laughing)

00:41:36.020 --> 00:41:36.860
 - Whose turn is it?

00:41:36.860 --> 00:41:37.700
 - Oh, it's my turn.

00:41:37.700 --> 00:41:39.740
 So thank you, that was a good one.

00:41:39.740 --> 00:41:41.740
 - Antonio Mantica says,

00:41:41.740 --> 00:41:44.460
 "Just finished listening to episode 559

00:41:44.460 --> 00:41:46.340
 where you mentioned that the Catholic diocese

00:41:46.340 --> 00:41:48.740
 of Orlando claims jurisdiction over the moon

00:41:48.740 --> 00:41:51.440
 since that's where Apollo 11 launched from.

00:41:51.440 --> 00:41:53.340
 I'm surprised nobody, brackets Dan,

00:41:53.340 --> 00:41:55.540
 didn't mention that Buzz Aldrin,

00:41:55.540 --> 00:41:58.820
 a Texas freemason established a Masonic lodge

00:41:58.820 --> 00:42:00.980
 on the moon called Tranquility Lodge,

00:42:00.980 --> 00:42:04.300
 a number 2000 under the Grand Lodge of Texas

00:42:04.300 --> 00:42:07.260
 who now claim Masonic jurisdiction to the moon.

00:42:07.260 --> 00:42:08.580
 According to their official website,

00:42:08.580 --> 00:42:11.340
 meetings are held quarterly in various cities around Texas

00:42:11.340 --> 00:42:13.300
 until such time as the lodge may hold

00:42:13.300 --> 00:42:14.980
 its meetings on the moon itself.

00:42:14.980 --> 00:42:18.220
 Can I just say, I did randomly select these things

00:42:18.220 --> 00:42:19.300
 out of the pile.

00:42:19.300 --> 00:42:20.540
 I've never heard of that.

00:42:20.540 --> 00:42:23.100
 - I didn't think he was a Mason.

00:42:23.100 --> 00:42:24.420
 - I mean, you can be a Catholic in a Mason.

00:42:24.420 --> 00:42:25.860
 - Of course, what a surprise.

00:42:25.860 --> 00:42:28.220
 - Yeah, that rings a tiny bell.

00:42:28.220 --> 00:42:29.060
 I don't remember.

00:42:29.060 --> 00:42:30.940
 - We did quite extensive research on him

00:42:30.940 --> 00:42:32.420
 when he came on our radio show.

00:42:32.420 --> 00:42:33.260
 - Yeah.

00:42:33.260 --> 00:42:34.740
 - I didn't, that never came up.

00:42:34.740 --> 00:42:35.900
 - Well, it wouldn't do.

00:42:35.900 --> 00:42:36.740
 - Oh, did it.

00:42:36.740 --> 00:42:40.380
 - It feels like the 20th century was big for the Masons.

00:42:40.380 --> 00:42:41.220
 - Oh, yeah.

00:42:41.220 --> 00:42:42.580
 - It's now not quite as big a thing.

00:42:42.580 --> 00:42:43.740
 - Yeah, I think on downhill a bit, do you think?

00:42:43.740 --> 00:42:45.100
 - I think a little bit.

00:42:45.100 --> 00:42:46.540
 - That's a shame, isn't it?

00:42:46.540 --> 00:42:51.780
 I think that all the forces are at large now.

00:42:51.780 --> 00:42:52.620
 - Internet.

00:42:52.620 --> 00:42:56.500
 - The Masons of the modern day, the Internets.

00:42:56.500 --> 00:42:58.300
 Well, it's just a shame to lose

00:42:58.300 --> 00:42:59.980
 those exciting handshakes.

00:42:59.980 --> 00:43:00.820
 - Yeah, that's true.

00:43:00.820 --> 00:43:01.660
 That's true.

00:43:01.660 --> 00:43:02.500
 I agree with that.

00:43:02.500 --> 00:43:03.340
 Here's one.

00:43:03.340 --> 00:43:04.180
 - I don't know them.

00:43:04.180 --> 00:43:05.140
 How do you know they're exciting?

00:43:05.140 --> 00:43:06.860
 - Yeah, you are not allowed in.

00:43:06.860 --> 00:43:07.700
 What's going on?

00:43:07.700 --> 00:43:09.020
 - Any handshake is exciting.

00:43:09.020 --> 00:43:10.300
 There's not a conventional handshake, right?

00:43:10.300 --> 00:43:12.300
 If you shake someone's hand and anything happens,

00:43:12.300 --> 00:43:14.540
 that's not just them grasping your hand and shaking it,

00:43:14.540 --> 00:43:15.380
 you're excited.

00:43:15.380 --> 00:43:16.220
 - I don't know.

00:43:16.220 --> 00:43:17.580
 That one with the finger goes and gives you a little tickle.

00:43:17.580 --> 00:43:18.740
 - You'd be excited.

00:43:18.740 --> 00:43:20.420
 - I'd rather giggle than tickle in my case.

00:43:20.420 --> 00:43:23.060
 (laughing)

00:43:23.060 --> 00:43:26.020
 - Here's a great one from Andre Ryback.

00:43:26.020 --> 00:43:28.540
 Regarding pink noise and the human ear bracing

00:43:28.540 --> 00:43:29.820
 for impact of a louder noise.

00:43:29.820 --> 00:43:32.380
 - Yes, I mentioned that where cars have a pink noise

00:43:32.380 --> 00:43:33.700
 that they release just before impact

00:43:33.700 --> 00:43:35.100
 so that your eardrums don't shatter.

00:43:35.100 --> 00:43:35.920
 - Brilliant.

00:43:35.920 --> 00:43:38.180
 I was very surprised that none of the hosts mentioned

00:43:38.180 --> 00:43:40.460
 the tense or timpani muscle.

00:43:40.460 --> 00:43:43.100
 It's one of the most, no such thing as a fish muscles

00:43:43.100 --> 00:43:45.900
 in the human body because a portion of the population

00:43:45.900 --> 00:43:48.220
 has voluntary control of it.

00:43:48.220 --> 00:43:50.740
 The other portion who only have the automatic reflex

00:43:50.740 --> 00:43:52.420
 that was mentioned on fish

00:43:52.420 --> 00:43:54.340
 can never fully know what it's like.

00:43:54.340 --> 00:43:57.860
 So this is what Andre says and it turns out I can do this.

00:43:57.860 --> 00:43:59.900
 Tensing the tense or timpani muscle allows you

00:43:59.900 --> 00:44:02.420
 to make a rumbling noise in the ear on demand,

00:44:02.420 --> 00:44:03.540
 a noise that only you can hear.

00:44:03.540 --> 00:44:06.220
 So you just sort of tense your inner ear.

00:44:06.220 --> 00:44:07.460
 You can hear that rumbling.

00:44:07.460 --> 00:44:08.300
 - Oh my God. - Change of nodding,

00:44:08.300 --> 00:44:09.140
 you can do that.

00:44:09.140 --> 00:44:11.300
 - Hold on, so I tense my inner ear.

00:44:11.300 --> 00:44:13.900
 - Just make the rumbling noise in your ear.

00:44:13.900 --> 00:44:16.140
 - Oh yeah, just did it.

00:44:16.140 --> 00:44:16.980
 - Yeah.

00:44:16.980 --> 00:44:19.180
 - No, I can make a high ringing noise, but not a rumbling.

00:44:19.180 --> 00:44:20.780
 - You can't join the secret club then.

00:44:20.780 --> 00:44:22.260
 (laughing)

00:44:22.260 --> 00:44:24.620
 Oh, we had such an amazing hand shake plant.

00:44:24.620 --> 00:44:27.140
 (laughing)

00:44:27.140 --> 00:44:29.820
 - I love that thing that they said of the most

00:44:29.820 --> 00:44:32.900
 no such thing as a fish muscle, they say.

00:44:32.900 --> 00:44:35.140
 - Yeah, he said most no such thing as fish

00:44:35.140 --> 00:44:36.980
 class QI muscles, but I edited it down.

00:44:36.980 --> 00:44:38.820
 - Oh okay, but still it's quite a cool thing

00:44:38.820 --> 00:44:40.820
 that we've built off the back of finding

00:44:40.820 --> 00:44:43.140
 these interesting facts and that's another book idea.

00:44:43.140 --> 00:44:45.820
 You know, the most no such thing as a fish thing.

00:44:45.820 --> 00:44:47.220
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:44:47.220 --> 00:44:48.060
 - I love that.

00:44:48.060 --> 00:44:50.020
 - Can I give an alternate muscle just while we're

00:44:50.020 --> 00:44:51.860
 in the ear area?

00:44:51.860 --> 00:44:54.580
 And that is recently, you know, like some animals

00:44:54.580 --> 00:44:58.500
 can move their ears and humans can move their ears,

00:44:58.500 --> 00:45:00.060
 but really they're just moving the jaw

00:45:00.060 --> 00:45:03.180
 and the ears kind of go, but we have the muscles

00:45:03.180 --> 00:45:04.940
 that can move your ears in the same way

00:45:04.940 --> 00:45:07.540
 that a dog or a cat can move their ears,

00:45:07.540 --> 00:45:09.300
 but the muscles are not strong enough.

00:45:09.300 --> 00:45:12.060
 They did an experiment where they played some sound

00:45:12.060 --> 00:45:15.820
 in an area and they looked at what like muscles

00:45:15.820 --> 00:45:17.820
 were tensing and they could see that these muscles

00:45:17.820 --> 00:45:20.140
 were moving, but they weren't moving their ears.

00:45:20.140 --> 00:45:20.980
 - Wow.

00:45:20.980 --> 00:45:22.180
 - So yeah, like if you hear a sound,

00:45:22.180 --> 00:45:23.500
 if you hear someone you say your name

00:45:23.500 --> 00:45:26.140
 behind you to the left, your body is trying

00:45:26.140 --> 00:45:27.620
 to move your ear around towards it,

00:45:27.620 --> 00:45:28.460
 but the muscles aren't strong enough.

00:45:28.460 --> 00:45:31.300
 - Is there something we could, like if we snipped

00:45:31.300 --> 00:45:33.460
 a bit of the top and bottom of your ear,

00:45:33.460 --> 00:45:34.620
 do you think it could swivel?

00:45:34.620 --> 00:45:37.260
 - Oh yeah, like a tongue tie, we've got a near tie.

00:45:37.260 --> 00:45:38.860
 - What if you just spent your life training

00:45:38.860 --> 00:45:40.620
 and then you spent your life training your children

00:45:40.620 --> 00:45:42.420
 to try and move their ears

00:45:42.420 --> 00:45:44.420
 and they spent their life training their children.

00:45:44.420 --> 00:45:45.860
 How long would it take before we could get this back?

00:45:45.860 --> 00:45:46.980
 - We will probably have to find--

00:45:46.980 --> 00:45:50.060
 - That's not how evolution works, I don't think.

00:45:50.060 --> 00:45:51.380
 - Oh, you have to get a flamarcosis.

00:45:51.380 --> 00:45:52.300
 - Yes, you are.

00:45:52.300 --> 00:45:55.260
 - Has a flamarcosis been overtaken, sorry?

00:45:55.260 --> 00:45:57.860
 - What would be better is if some people

00:45:57.860 --> 00:46:01.220
 genetically modified so that they could move their ears

00:46:01.220 --> 00:46:03.980
 and then they found each other really sexy.

00:46:03.980 --> 00:46:05.780
 - Will they hear more people saying, "Do you want to have sex?"

00:46:05.780 --> 00:46:08.300
 And then they are more fertile as a result.

00:46:08.300 --> 00:46:09.140
 - Exactly, yeah.

00:46:09.140 --> 00:46:10.660
 - That's all you think's been holding you back.

00:46:10.660 --> 00:46:13.260
 - I'm on the dance mat, I can't hear a thing.

00:46:13.260 --> 00:46:23.300
 - Well, shall we wrap up?

00:46:23.300 --> 00:46:24.140
 - Yeah.

00:46:24.140 --> 00:46:27.740
 - Thank you so much to everyone for sending in your effects

00:46:27.740 --> 00:46:30.500
 and for listening and please keep sending them in.

00:46:30.500 --> 00:46:32.340
 We are podcast@qi.com.

00:46:32.340 --> 00:46:34.660
 We love getting facts, we get a load of great ones.

00:46:34.660 --> 00:46:36.020
 These are the absolute creme de la creme.

00:46:36.020 --> 00:46:37.460
 This is the standard, really.

00:46:37.460 --> 00:46:39.220
 You should be matching.

00:46:39.220 --> 00:46:40.540
 - Variable.

00:46:40.540 --> 00:46:42.180
 (all laughing)

00:46:42.180 --> 00:46:45.140
 - Just like us, it's the nicest tribute anyone could pay.

00:46:45.140 --> 00:46:47.580
 So thank you again, we will be back in a week

00:46:47.580 --> 00:46:52.580
 with a regular broadcast between now and then,

00:46:52.580 --> 00:46:56.820
 I guess it's just time to sing the song.

00:46:56.820 --> 00:46:59.580
 - As we always do, Andy, we'll get out of here.

00:46:59.580 --> 00:47:02.220
 - Yeah, just go to, just, I mean, just, you know.

00:47:02.220 --> 00:47:04.460
 - Darn, you want to wrap us up?

00:47:04.460 --> 00:47:05.740
 (all laughing)

00:47:05.740 --> 00:47:07.580
 - Okay, that's it, that's all of your facts.

00:47:07.580 --> 00:47:09.020
 Thank you very much for listening.

00:47:09.020 --> 00:47:11.300
 If you'd like to get in contact, Andy, take over.

00:47:11.300 --> 00:47:13.700
 - You can get in touch with us on the internet.

00:47:13.700 --> 00:47:14.980
 I'm on--

00:47:14.980 --> 00:47:15.800
 - I'm back in.

00:47:15.800 --> 00:47:17.980
 You can get us on our various social media accounts.

00:47:17.980 --> 00:47:20.780
 I'm on Instagram, on @shrivaland, James.

00:47:20.780 --> 00:47:23.660
 - My Instagram is the nicest thing is James Hacken.

00:47:23.660 --> 00:47:26.220
 - Andy, I'm on Blue Sky, @andrewhunterm.

00:47:26.220 --> 00:47:27.220
 - Yeah, and @andrewhunterm,

00:47:27.220 --> 00:47:28.460
 where can they get to us as a group?

00:47:28.460 --> 00:47:30.420
 - Instagram are no such thing as a fish.

00:47:30.420 --> 00:47:32.060
 Twitter are no such thing.

00:47:32.060 --> 00:47:34.060
 Or email podcast.qi.com.

00:47:34.060 --> 00:47:34.900
 - We can do it.

00:47:34.900 --> 00:47:35.720
 - We also have a website, don't we, Andy?

00:47:35.720 --> 00:47:40.560
 - Yes, it's no such thing as a fish.com, is it?

00:47:40.560 --> 00:47:41.400
 - Yeah, it is.

00:47:41.400 --> 00:47:42.240
 - Okay, yeah.

00:47:42.240 --> 00:47:44.020
 - And if you go to those such things as a fish.com,

00:47:44.020 --> 00:47:45.220
 there's all sorts of stuff there.

00:47:45.220 --> 00:47:48.340
 Lots of previous episodes, some merch.

00:47:48.340 --> 00:47:50.060
 There's the Portal to Club Fish,

00:47:50.060 --> 00:47:51.060
 which is our member's club,

00:47:51.060 --> 00:47:53.420
 where you can get all sorts of bonus content,

00:47:53.420 --> 00:47:55.500
 really fun, ad-free episodes.

00:47:55.500 --> 00:47:56.660
 Oh.

00:47:56.660 --> 00:47:57.500
 - Do that.

00:47:57.500 --> 00:47:58.500
 - Do that.

00:47:58.500 --> 00:47:59.340
 - Get back in, Dan.

00:47:59.340 --> 00:48:00.620
 (both laughing)

00:48:00.620 --> 00:48:02.420
 - Tag me, tag me.

00:48:02.420 --> 00:48:04.700
 We're also playing a live show in Sheffield in July.

00:48:04.700 --> 00:48:05.540
 You should come to it.

00:48:05.540 --> 00:48:06.660
 It's called The Crossed Wires Festival.

00:48:06.660 --> 00:48:09.260
 It's a podcast festival, very exciting.

00:48:09.260 --> 00:48:10.820
 But otherwise, just come back next week,

00:48:10.820 --> 00:48:11.900
 where we'll have someone who actually knows

00:48:11.900 --> 00:48:13.100
 how to helm this show.

00:48:13.100 --> 00:48:14.860
 We'll see you then, Andy.

00:48:14.860 --> 00:48:15.700
 - Bye.

00:48:15.700 --> 00:48:17.380
 - Goodbye.

00:48:17.380 --> 00:48:18.660
 - What, did I get that wrong?

00:48:18.660 --> 00:48:20.860
 (both laughing)

00:48:20.860 --> 00:48:23.440
 (upbeat music)

00:48:23.440 --> 00:48:26.020
 (upbeat music)

00:48:27.020 --> 00:48:29.600
 (upbeat music)

00:48:29.600 --> 00:48:32.180
 (upbeat music)
