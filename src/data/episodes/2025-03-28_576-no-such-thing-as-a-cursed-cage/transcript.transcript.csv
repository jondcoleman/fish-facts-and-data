00:00:02,00:00:13,"- Hello, and welcome to another episode"
00:00:13,00:00:14,"of No Steps to Thing as a Fish,"
00:00:14,00:00:15,a weekly podcast coming to you
00:00:15,00:00:17,from the QI offices in Hoban.
00:00:17,00:00:18,My name is Andrew Hunter Murray.
00:00:18,00:00:20,"I'm here with Dan Schreiber, James Harkin,"
00:00:20,00:00:22,"and Anna Tijinski, and we have gathered"
00:00:22,00:00:26,"around the table for a quarterly, I think."
00:00:26,00:00:28,"- We aim for that, but we only did three last year."
00:00:28,00:00:29,- There we go.
00:00:29,00:00:30,- A...
00:00:30,00:00:32,Triennial...
00:00:32,00:00:35,"Show, where we go through the fish inbox,"
00:00:35,00:00:37,"podcast@qi.com, we find the best facts"
00:00:37,00:00:40,"that you have sent to us, and we read them back to you."
00:00:40,00:00:43,"So we've all learned from each other, and it's all square."
00:00:43,00:00:44,The inbox has had lots and lots of brilliant
00:00:44,00:00:45,fact submissions over the last few months.
00:00:45,00:00:46,"- It's overflowing, Andy."
00:00:46,00:00:48,- It's bulging.
00:00:48,00:00:49,We've got a bulging post-bag.
00:00:49,00:00:51,- We have physical things to read.
00:00:51,00:00:54,"- Yes, so the guys here have not seen"
00:00:54,00:00:55,the facts that we've been sent.
00:00:55,00:00:57,"I have brought them in, printed them out on bits of paper,"
00:00:57,00:00:59,and chopped the bits of paper up.
00:00:59,00:01:01,"We all have a stack of small slips of paper in front of us,"
00:01:01,00:01:02,"and we're going to see if this works,"
00:01:02,00:01:03,which I think it might.
00:01:03,00:01:06,"So let's have a fact, if anyone's got one."
00:01:06,00:01:09,"- Okay, I'm going to open with a fact from Leander,"
00:01:09,00:01:11,from Switzerland.
00:01:11,00:01:14,"Inkus, the last Carolina parakeet,"
00:01:14,00:01:16,"died in the same cage as Martha,"
00:01:16,00:01:18,the last passenger pigeon.
00:01:18,00:01:20,"- Oh, that's interesting."
00:01:20,00:01:21,- No further info.
00:01:21,00:01:22,- Crazy.
00:01:22,00:01:23,"- It's, yeah, mad."
00:01:23,00:01:25,- Are we saying that it's a cursed cage?
00:01:25,00:01:26,- Must be.
00:01:26,00:01:27,"- It's got to be, unless they just killed each other,"
00:01:27,00:01:29,it's one of those fights of the death where they both.
00:01:29,00:01:31,"- So wait, what was it, the last passenger pigeon,"
00:01:31,00:01:32,"and the last, what, sorry?"
00:01:32,00:01:33,"- The last Carolina parakeet,"
00:01:33,00:01:35,"which does seem quite specific, but still cool."
00:01:35,00:01:38,"- Still, still, it's two of a kind."
00:01:38,00:01:39,"- Oh yeah, actually, when I first read it,"
00:01:39,00:01:40,"I thought that it was Inkus,"
00:01:40,00:01:42,"the last Carolina parakeet,"
00:01:42,00:01:44,"and Martha, and now it would have been even more amazing."
00:01:44,00:01:46,- All the Inkus died.
00:01:46,00:01:47,- All the Inkus died.
00:01:47,00:01:49,"- This sounds like, I hope Stephen King isn't listening,"
00:01:49,00:01:52,'cause that sounds right up his street of a murderous cage.
00:01:52,00:01:54,"- The cursed cage, yeah, yeah."
00:01:54,00:01:58,"- It could be a sort of like a retirement home of cages,"
00:01:58,00:02:00,"where it's, you know, it's the last of a species goes there."
00:02:00,00:02:03,"- Yeah, it's really, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:02:03,00:02:04,- Maybe.
00:02:04,00:02:07,- They see like little pictures on the cage wall
00:02:07,00:02:09,"of the previous tenants, you know."
00:02:09,00:02:10,- Is that what they do in all people's homes and stuff?
00:02:10,00:02:12,They have the pictures of the analysis.
00:02:12,00:02:13,- Have you ever watched the traitors?
00:02:13,00:02:14,"Whenever anyone leaves,"
00:02:14,00:02:16,they put a big red cross through their face.
00:02:16,00:02:17,They do that in all people's homes as well.
00:02:17,00:02:18,- I didn't know that.
00:02:18,00:02:19,- That's how it works.
00:02:19,00:02:21,"- Oh, you know, you gotta face up to the truth, don't you?"
00:02:21,00:02:22,- Yeah.
00:02:22,00:02:24,- Gosh.
00:02:24,00:02:25,"- Well, that's a great fact."
00:02:25,00:02:27,"- It's an excellent fact, very cool."
00:02:27,00:02:28,"- Can I do one, honey?"
00:02:28,00:02:29,- Yeah.
00:02:29,00:02:32,"- This is from Hediver, and it says,"
00:02:32,00:02:35,"""Dear Anna, you are always my favorite podcast host."""
00:02:35,00:02:36,"- Yeah, that makes sense."
00:02:36,00:02:39,- I feel like I picked up the wrong pile here.
00:02:39,00:02:40,- That's a good fact.
00:02:40,00:02:41,It's not an interesting fact.
00:02:41,00:02:42,It's a pretty basic fact.
00:02:42,00:02:43,We've had it loads.
00:02:43,00:02:44,"- If someone else has taken over the mailbox,"
00:02:44,00:02:46,duty please disregard that.
00:02:46,00:02:47,"- Yes, thank you."
00:02:47,00:02:50,"- Consider it disregarded, Hediver."
00:02:50,00:02:53,I write now to share the most fish fact I have ever learned.
00:02:53,00:02:56,"There is one extant species of marsupial,"
00:02:56,00:03:00,"the water opossum, in which the males have pouches."
00:03:00,00:03:02,"These pouches are not used to host joeys,"
00:03:02,00:03:04,but serve the exclusive purpose
00:03:04,00:03:06,of storing the male genitalia
00:03:06,00:03:09,to prevent them from getting tangled in weeds while swimming.
00:03:09,00:03:10,(laughing)
00:03:10,00:03:11,- Wow.
00:03:11,00:03:13,- That's so good.
00:03:13,00:03:14,- That's incredible.
00:03:14,00:03:15,- Tangled in weeds.
00:03:15,00:03:17,- Do you wish you had that?
00:03:17,00:03:19,"- I don't go while swimming like you do, Anna."
00:03:19,00:03:21,"- No, okay, and I don't get stuff tangled in weeds too."
00:03:21,00:03:23,- I'm always getting tangled in weeds.
00:03:23,00:03:25,(laughing)
00:03:25,00:03:28,"- I can't picture the genitals of,"
00:03:28,00:03:29,can anyone of this particular animal?
00:03:29,00:03:32,"- If it's marsupial, then it will be"
00:03:32,00:03:34,"quite a big bull sack kangaroos, have a leg."
00:03:34,00:03:37,I have a kangaroo bull sack purse at home.
00:03:37,00:03:38,(laughing)
00:03:38,00:03:39,Two dozen.
00:03:39,00:03:40,(laughing)
00:03:40,00:03:43,- To see James tip in a restaurant is quite a sight.
00:03:43,00:03:44,(laughing)
00:03:44,00:03:47,"As he gets out his little pantsnay glasses,"
00:03:47,00:03:47,(laughing)
00:03:47,00:03:50,and opens the glass on his kangaroo scrotum.
00:03:50,00:03:51,- Yeah.
00:03:52,00:03:54,"- I thought you guys knew that, that I had that."
00:03:54,00:03:56,I bought it when we were on tour the first time
00:03:56,00:03:56,in Australia. - Did you?
00:03:56,00:03:57,- Yeah.
00:03:57,00:03:59,"- That's, yeah, it's ringing a bell now, yeah."
00:03:59,00:04:02,- So what was it? - Is it roomy?
00:04:02,00:04:03,(laughing)
00:04:03,00:04:06,"- No, not, well, you could probably keep"
00:04:06,00:04:07,a couple of billiard balls in it.
00:04:07,00:04:09,"- Oh, okay, that is roomy."
00:04:09,00:04:12,I don't mean to give away too much.
00:04:12,00:04:13,(laughing)
00:04:13,00:04:14,I am impressed.
00:04:14,00:04:18,"- But yeah, kangaroos have got quite large scrotum."
00:04:18,00:04:19,- And what's this called?
00:04:19,00:04:20,There's marsupial.
00:04:20,00:04:21,- This is a water opossum.
00:04:21,00:04:22,"But I think generally speaking,"
00:04:22,00:04:26,"marsupials have similar reproductive systems, don't they?"
00:04:26,00:04:27,- Yeah.
00:04:27,00:04:28,"- They all tend to have like,"
00:04:28,00:04:29,uteruses with three openings.
00:04:29,00:04:30,- Mm.
00:04:30,00:04:32,- Did that specify where the pouch was?
00:04:32,00:04:33,"'Cause I'm picturing a kangaroo pouch,"
00:04:33,00:04:34,and that feels like quite a long journey to-
00:04:34,00:04:36,- Probably not far off.
00:04:36,00:04:37,(laughing)
00:04:37,00:04:38,"- It's probably not far off, though."
00:04:38,00:04:41,"- You can't tuck yours in your top pocket, for instance."
00:04:41,00:04:42,(laughing)
00:04:42,00:04:44,Have you forgotten one of those little handkerchiefs?
00:04:44,00:04:47,(laughing)
00:04:47,00:04:49,- But the way evolution works is so mad.
00:04:49,00:04:50,'Cause it must have started out as a little skin flap
00:04:50,00:04:51,or something.
00:04:51,00:04:52,- Yeah.
00:04:52,00:04:55,- And presumably fewer male water opossums drowned
00:04:55,00:04:57,because they had this little evolutionary skin flap.
00:04:57,00:04:58,"- Well, all had their testicles torn off"
00:04:58,00:04:59,and couldn't reproduce.
00:04:59,00:05:00,"- Right, exactly."
00:05:00,00:05:01,"But there must have been a way in which like,"
00:05:01,00:05:03,have you heard the latest thing in the water opossum world
00:05:03,00:05:06,"is this little flap of skin, which protects your knackers?"
00:05:06,00:05:08,"I just think that's, it's unbelievable."
00:05:08,00:05:10,And then those are the fit ones that survived.
00:05:10,00:05:10,- It's crazy.
00:05:10,00:05:13,"And of course, with this entire format,"
00:05:13,00:05:15,we are relying on the people who wrote to us
00:05:15,00:05:17,telling us the truth.
00:05:17,00:05:17,- Oh yeah.
00:05:17,00:05:20,I've done no quality control on these whatsoever.
00:05:20,00:05:21,"- Do your own research, guys."
00:05:21,00:05:23,"We do it every week, you know?"
00:05:23,00:05:25,Still haven't taken some responsibility.
00:05:25,00:05:26,"- But ahead of that, I believe you."
00:05:26,00:05:27,- Very cool.
00:05:27,00:05:28,- Brilliant.
00:05:28,00:05:29,- Shall I do one?
00:05:29,00:05:29,- Yeah.
00:05:29,00:05:30,"- This is from Dr. Kevin W. Jennings,"
00:05:30,00:05:34,"Department of Social Sciences, Lincoln Memorial University."
00:05:34,00:05:37,Astronaut Steve Hawley's space shuttle launches
00:05:37,00:05:38,kept getting scrubbed.
00:05:38,00:05:41,He had 15 or 16 launches scrubbed in his career.
00:05:41,00:05:43,"A record, question mark."
00:05:43,00:05:46,"After one scrub, I think scrub means didn't happen."
00:05:46,00:05:47,- Capsled.
00:05:47,00:05:48,- Yeah.
00:05:48,00:05:50,"- You know, that's some no scrubs."
00:05:50,00:05:51,It's written by an astronaut
00:05:51,00:05:52,who really wanted to go into space.
00:05:52,00:05:56,"- After one scrub prior to his fourth mission,"
00:05:56,00:05:58,he remarked that the space shuttle
00:05:58,00:06:00,obviously knew he was aboard.
00:06:00,00:06:02,So it was refusing to launch.
00:06:02,00:06:03,His crewmates agreed.
00:06:03,00:06:05,So they made him wear a disguise
00:06:05,00:06:07,during the next launch attempt.
00:06:07,00:06:07,- No.
00:06:07,00:06:09,- They're all in spacesuits.
00:06:09,00:06:11,How much better disguise can you get?
00:06:11,00:06:15,"- Yeah, so they made him wear a disguise"
00:06:15,00:06:17,during the next launch attempt.
00:06:17,00:06:19,So the shuttle wouldn't recognize him.
00:06:19,00:06:20,It worked.
00:06:20,00:06:22,And the shuttle launched on that attempt.
00:06:22,00:06:25,The crew of his fifth mission forced him to do it again.
00:06:25,00:06:26,And it was successful again.
00:06:26,00:06:29,Apparently the space shuttle just didn't like him.
00:06:29,00:06:30,Pictures for a proof.
00:06:30,00:06:32,And then Andy's not included the pictures.
00:06:32,00:06:33,"- Oh, no."
00:06:33,00:06:35,- But wow.
00:06:35,00:06:36,- The pictures seem essential.
00:06:36,00:06:39,"This disguise, was it a kangaroo disguise?"
00:06:39,00:06:42,"Was it, what could it have been?"
00:06:42,00:06:46,- Testicles were popping out of the book.
00:06:46,00:06:47,It's called Harley this guy.
00:06:47,00:06:48,- Steve Hawley.
00:06:48,00:06:49,- That's amazing.
00:06:49,00:06:50,- Very cool.
00:06:50,00:06:51,"- God, and that's the scientists who believed that."
00:06:51,00:06:53,These are the people who were trusting to build rockets.
00:06:53,00:06:55,People who think space shuttles decide against people.
00:06:55,00:06:57,"- The astronauts, they'll build the rockets."
00:06:57,00:06:58,"- Oh, do they know?"
00:06:58,00:06:59,I thought you had to do it all the way through.
00:06:59,00:07:01,"- Dan, was that from an eminent scientist?"
00:07:01,00:07:02,Did you say?
00:07:02,00:07:03,- That was from a doctor.
00:07:03,00:07:04,- Okay.
00:07:04,00:07:05,"- It's not eminent, is it?"
00:07:05,00:07:05,That'd be professor.
00:07:05,00:07:10,- You get away with nothing in this game.
00:07:10,00:07:11,- I'm a moderately achieving scientist.
00:07:11,00:07:12,- Okay.
00:07:12,00:07:14,"Well, this, geez."
00:07:14,00:07:15,"Here's an email from Colin McIntyre,"
00:07:15,00:07:17,"who says, ""I'm the educator and resident historian"
00:07:17,00:07:20,"""of the New England Aquarium in Boston."""
00:07:20,00:07:21,- Cool.
00:07:21,00:07:23,"- ""It entertains me and my colleagues no end"
00:07:23,00:07:25,"""when our beloved aquarium is mentioned on your podcast,"
00:07:25,00:07:28,"""e.g. Andre the seal, Animal Bartering,"
00:07:28,00:07:31,"""but we've never heard you refer to it by its actual name."
00:07:31,00:07:32,"""As a friend of the podcast,"
00:07:32,00:07:33,"""I believe we've earned the right to be called"
00:07:33,00:07:34,"""the New England Aquarium"
00:07:34,00:07:37,"""rather than just an aquarium in Boston."""
00:07:37,00:07:38,So fair enough.
00:07:38,00:07:39,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:07:39,00:07:42,- And he's included some facts and here's one of them.
00:07:42,00:07:46,There is a mummified cod buried in the foundation
00:07:46,00:07:48,"of the New England Aquarium,"
00:07:48,00:07:50,"but that's not the weird thing about it, I think."
00:07:50,00:07:52,What he says is it's called Ichabod.
00:07:52,00:07:56,The fish started the construction of the entire aquarium.
00:07:56,00:07:58,This is mad.
00:07:58,00:08:00,So the fish was the star
00:08:00,00:08:03,"of the aquarium's groundbreaking ceremony in 1965,"
00:08:03,00:08:05,when a scuba diver holding him
00:08:05,00:08:07,emerged from nearby Boston Harbor
00:08:07,00:08:08,and dropped him into a tank of water.
00:08:08,00:08:10,"So at this point, it's a live fish."
00:08:10,00:08:13,This electronically triggered the construction equipment
00:08:13,00:08:16,"on the future site of the aquarium,"
00:08:16,00:08:19,thanks to a system designed by Harold Doc Egerton.
00:08:19,00:08:23,"So the New England Aquarium was,"
00:08:23,00:08:24,the construction was kick-started by a fish
00:08:24,00:08:26,being dropped into a tank of water.
00:08:26,00:08:27,- It was intentional.
00:08:27,00:08:28,"- That was what it was always going to be, right?"
00:08:28,00:08:29,- Yes.
00:08:29,00:08:30,- They planned.
00:08:30,00:08:32,"- This was meant to be a library,"
00:08:32,00:08:33,"but we were going to drop in a book,"
00:08:33,00:08:36,but then we dropped in a fish by mistake.
00:08:36,00:08:38,It's hard to tell if rockets know
00:08:38,00:08:39,which astronauts are going to go.
00:08:39,00:08:40,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:08:40,00:08:42,"So they decided to build as a aquarium,"
00:08:42,00:08:43,starting with a fish.
00:08:43,00:08:44,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:08:44,00:08:46,"A scuba diver comes out of the water holding a live fish,"
00:08:46,00:08:47,"drops it into a tank,"
00:08:47,00:08:49,and that electronically senses a fish has been dropped in
00:08:49,00:08:51,and triggers the construction equipment.
00:08:51,00:08:53,That is a very cool opening ceremony.
00:08:53,00:08:55,"- You know, like if you watch the Olympics,"
00:08:55,00:08:58,"they have the word they set off the fire, the flame."
00:08:58,00:09:00,"They always do something really exciting,"
00:09:00,00:09:02,but actually it's just a guy with a button
00:09:02,00:09:03,"who's sat next to it, right?"
00:09:03,00:09:04,- Right.
00:09:04,00:09:06,- I feel like I would do it in this situation as well.
00:09:06,00:09:07,I'm sorry to say.
00:09:07,00:09:08,- Do you mean like there was that famous one
00:09:08,00:09:10,where an archer shot the flame
00:09:10,00:09:11,and we all thought it landed?
00:09:11,00:09:14,"Yeah, but it was, I see, yes."
00:09:14,00:09:15,- And who was it?
00:09:15,00:09:16,Which president?
00:09:16,00:09:17,There was a president who had to tell
00:09:17,00:09:19,on the Christmas lights once remotely.
00:09:19,00:09:21,"And he thought, I think it was in the '50s,"
00:09:21,00:09:23,"it was maybe it was Lyndon Johnson,"
00:09:23,00:09:26,and he thought he was doing it remotely
00:09:26,00:09:28,'cause of this amazing remote light turning on technology.
00:09:28,00:09:29,"And actually, I think there was just someone"
00:09:29,00:09:31,that lights in the White House who just looked to switch.
00:09:31,00:09:32,"- Yeah, right."
00:09:32,00:09:34,- Maybe that's how it's happening all over the world.
00:09:34,00:09:36,"- So you're casting doubt on this, James, I think."
00:09:36,00:09:38,"- I'm just saying that if I was in charge,"
00:09:38,00:09:39,I wouldn't rely on the fish.
00:09:39,00:09:40,"- Yeah, that's fair."
00:09:40,00:09:44,"When the Queen, the true Queen, sent her first tweet"
00:09:44,00:09:46,"or whatever, she pressed a button,"
00:09:46,00:09:48,and then I think it just like prodded a nearby intern
00:09:48,00:09:50,to a friend and sent tweet.
00:09:50,00:09:52,I seem to remember.
00:09:52,00:09:54,"- Wow, a fister of a Jack in a book."
00:09:54,00:09:57,Here's one from Ralph Linsangan.
00:09:57,00:09:59,He says he's a big fan.
00:09:59,00:10:00,"Thanks, Ralph."
00:10:00,00:10:01,And-
00:10:01,00:10:03,- Of yours or of all of us?
00:10:03,00:10:03,- I've got a scene of mine.
00:10:03,00:10:04,- What's your doctorate in?
00:10:04,00:10:05,Ralph?
00:10:07,00:10:10,"- America's just 71 miles long,"
00:10:10,00:10:12,measured from its easternmost point
00:10:12,00:10:15,to its westernmost point.
00:10:15,00:10:18,"And he's talking about that trick fact,"
00:10:18,00:10:20,"which is the Aleutian Islands,"
00:10:20,00:10:22,which cross the 180th Meridian.
00:10:22,00:10:24,So they constitute the easternmost
00:10:24,00:10:25,"and the westernmost point,"
00:10:25,00:10:27,but the other way around to which you'd think.
00:10:27,00:10:28,- Interesting.
00:10:28,00:10:29,- Because the easternmost point is the furthest
00:10:29,00:10:31,sort of west from where we are.
00:10:31,00:10:33,So there you go.
00:10:33,00:10:34,- That's a great fact.
00:10:34,00:10:34,"- Yeah, that's awesome."
00:10:34,00:10:35,- It is.
00:10:35,00:10:36,"And I remember, we were actually just talking"
00:10:36,00:10:39,"about the Aleutian Islands in a podcast we recorded,"
00:10:39,00:10:41,"which may have gone out by the time this goes out,"
00:10:41,00:10:42,or it may not have.
00:10:42,00:10:44,It's about Alaska.
00:10:44,00:10:45,But we were talking about something
00:10:45,00:10:46,that I don't think as well-
00:10:46,00:10:47,- It was last week's show.
00:10:47,00:10:48,- It was last week's show.
00:10:48,00:10:49,There you go.
00:10:49,00:10:50,"We were talking about something,"
00:10:50,00:10:51,"I don't think it's well known enough,"
00:10:51,00:10:53,that the only land war fought in America
00:10:53,00:10:56,"in the Second World War was in the Aleutian Islands,"
00:10:56,00:10:57,with the Japanese just-
00:10:57,00:10:57,"- That was Japan, USA."
00:10:57,00:10:59,I didn't think any bit of America
00:10:59,00:11:02,had ever been occupied in the Second World War.
00:11:02,00:11:04,"- Everyone forgets, Fuehler Islands."
00:11:04,00:11:05,- Yeah.
00:11:05,00:11:08,"- That's the bit where humans walked across, isn't it?"
00:11:08,00:11:10,"You know, there was a land bridge there."
00:11:10,00:11:11,- Oh really?
00:11:11,00:11:12,- From which side?
00:11:12,00:11:14,"- Well, Andy nodded, so you get a klaxon,"
00:11:14,00:11:16,because it's not true.
00:11:16,00:11:18,And this is recent.
00:11:18,00:11:20,They've kind of looked at what it would have been like
00:11:20,00:11:22,"around the time when humans came over,"
00:11:22,00:11:24,and that would have been pretty much impossible
00:11:24,00:11:27,"to walk over, because it was so muddy"
00:11:27,00:11:29,and swampy and stuff like that.
00:11:29,00:11:32,"So they must have gone across in either boats,"
00:11:32,00:11:37,"or you know, like putting huge tennis rackets on your shoes."
00:11:37,00:11:38,"- Like Pogo Sticks, isn't it?"
00:11:38,00:11:39,"- Oh, Pogo Sticks could have done it, yeah,"
00:11:39,00:11:41,but there's no way you could have walked across.
00:11:41,00:11:44,It wasn't a bridge in the modern sense of the word.
00:11:44,00:11:45,"- Really? - Yeah, right."
00:11:45,00:11:47,"So here's the fact that I think could have been for you, Dan,"
00:11:47,00:11:51,because they referenced two of your facts from history.
00:11:51,00:11:51,- Okay.
00:11:51,00:11:53,- It's from Vic Olds.
00:11:53,00:11:55,"And they say, ""I've been meaning to send in this fact"
00:11:55,00:11:57,"""for a long time and have been,"
00:11:57,00:11:58,"""after hearing your recent facts"
00:11:58,00:12:01,"""about Harry Balls and Willie Hull,"
00:12:01,00:12:04,"""I believe I have a female name to rival them."
00:12:04,00:12:07,"""About time we had some representation on this show, Dan."""
00:12:07,00:12:09,"- Back away. - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa."
00:12:09,00:12:12,"- ""In 1943, a horse called Count Fleet"
00:12:12,00:12:15,"""achieved the US Triple Crown in horse racing."
00:12:15,00:12:19,"""His owner/trainer was called Fanny Hertz."
00:12:19,00:12:22,"""And I believe it does sometimes when you ride horses."""
00:12:22,00:12:24,(laughing)
00:12:24,00:12:25,- Very strong. - Lovely.
00:12:25,00:12:28,"- Very strong, Fanny Hertz. - The famous hymen breaker,"
00:12:28,00:12:30,you're always told as a kid.
00:12:30,00:12:31,- Is that right?
00:12:31,00:12:34,"- Always told as a girl, don't worry."
00:12:34,00:12:36,Your hymen doesn't always break when you lose your virginity
00:12:36,00:12:38,because you might have been a horse rider.
00:12:38,00:12:39,- Yeah.
00:12:39,00:12:40,- And that probably would have broken it.
00:12:40,00:12:41,Gross for the horses.
00:12:41,00:12:43,(laughing)
00:12:43,00:12:45,"- You're not doing it naked, are you?"
00:12:45,00:12:46,"- Well, it depends which riding school you attend."
00:12:46,00:12:47,- Yeah.
00:12:47,00:12:49,Shall I do my next one?
00:12:49,00:12:51,"- Yeah, we probably had enough hymen chat."
00:12:51,00:12:51,(farting)
00:12:51,00:12:53,- I was curious about the name Sherlock
00:12:53,00:12:57,and how common it was in general use in the UK.
00:12:57,00:12:58,Turns out very not.
00:12:58,00:12:59,- According to...
00:12:59,00:13:01,(laughing)
00:13:01,00:13:02,- Did you write the same old time?
00:13:02,00:13:04,(laughing)
00:13:04,00:13:05,- Very not.
00:13:05,00:13:07,- Did I say very not?
00:13:07,00:13:08,- He said it. - Yeah.
00:13:08,00:13:09,- Who wrote the same old?
00:13:09,00:13:11,- I'll come to that a bit.
00:13:11,00:13:12,Turns out not very.
00:13:12,00:13:14,(laughing)
00:13:14,00:13:15,- Oh.
00:13:15,00:13:16,(laughing)
00:13:16,00:13:21,"- According to free BMD, births and marriages and deaths,"
00:13:21,00:13:23,there were seven children registered with the name Sherlock
00:13:23,00:13:27,between 1837 and 1887 when Conan Doyle
00:13:27,00:13:29,first published the fictional detective.
00:13:29,00:13:33,"Between 1890 and 1920, there were 16 Sherlocks born,"
00:13:33,00:13:36,half of whom also had the surname Holmes.
00:13:36,00:13:38,So families called Holmes seemed to like
00:13:38,00:13:40,having a son called Sherlock.
00:13:40,00:13:43,One family in Pontefract had both a Sherlock and a Mycroft.
00:13:43,00:13:44,- Oh.
00:13:44,00:13:48,"- The sons of Richard Holmes and Martha, Ney Belch."
00:13:48,00:13:51,So fan worship isn't anything new.
00:13:51,00:13:53,"It goes on, but the last Sherlock Holmes"
00:13:53,00:13:56,was born in 1942 in Stoke.
00:13:56,00:13:57,I believe he is still alive.
00:13:57,00:14:01,"And if so, would be the last of the gentlemen still standing."
00:14:01,00:14:03,And that's from Guy Holmes.
00:14:03,00:14:04,"- Ah, lovely. - Oh, nice."
00:14:04,00:14:05,- That's very cool.
00:14:05,00:14:07,"- Yeah, really cool research."
00:14:07,00:14:08,"- Right, here's one."
00:14:08,00:14:10,"Evan Friedman, American actor, Jerry Hallever,"
00:14:10,00:14:12,has appeared as Saddam Hussein in six separate films.
00:14:12,00:14:15,"In fact, Saddam Hussein is the only character"
00:14:15,00:14:16,he's ever played.
00:14:16,00:14:17,- Right.
00:14:17,00:14:18,- That's very good.
00:14:18,00:14:19,- Typecasting.
00:14:19,00:14:21,- I have a typecasting fact that I was gonna suggest
00:14:21,00:14:23,for a future show.
00:14:23,00:14:24,"Well, maybe I'll say it now."
00:14:24,00:14:25,- Yeah.
00:14:25,00:14:27,- So the woman who won Best Spotting Actress
00:14:27,00:14:31,before Gone With The Wind in 1939 was Hattie McDaniel.
00:14:31,00:14:34,And she played the same role
00:14:34,00:14:38,in I think it's about 130 other movies.
00:14:38,00:14:39,- Basically.
00:14:39,00:14:41,"- Not the same character, but the same style of character."
00:14:41,00:14:46,"'Cause she was typecast as like this sort of matriarchal,"
00:14:46,00:14:47,African-American mother.
00:14:47,00:14:48,- Okay.
00:14:48,00:14:52,"- And you know that in the Tom and Jerry cartoons,"
00:14:52,00:14:55,"when there's a lady stud that she's going,"
00:14:55,00:14:56,"""Tomas, Thomas!"""
00:14:56,00:14:57,That's based on her as well.
00:14:57,00:14:58,- Is it really?
00:14:58,00:15:00,"- Yeah, but she won this award."
00:15:00,00:15:03,"And actually, I think she couldn't go to a lot of parties"
00:15:03,00:15:06,'cause they were still segregated at the time.
00:15:06,00:15:08,"But when she won that award, yeah, basically they put her"
00:15:08,00:15:10,as exactly the same character in everything.
00:15:10,00:15:13,"- What a shame it's not literally the same character,"
00:15:13,00:15:17,like combining all these universes of film together.
00:15:17,00:15:19,It's one person.
00:15:19,00:15:19,- That's amazing.
00:15:19,00:15:21,"- That's incredible, yeah."
00:15:21,00:15:25,- Japan's crown jewels probably don't exist.
00:15:25,00:15:27,- Oh. - According to Steve McCabe.
00:15:27,00:15:29,(laughing)
00:15:29,00:15:30,- And he would know.
00:15:30,00:15:35,He says that Japan has three Imperial sacred treasures.
00:15:35,00:15:39,And then he lists those.
00:15:39,00:15:40,And apparently they're handed over
00:15:40,00:15:42,"to each new emperor, his coronation,"
00:15:42,00:15:43,but they've not been seen by anyone
00:15:43,00:15:47,outside the Imperial household in centuries.
00:15:47,00:15:49,Wikipedia notes that the actual historical status
00:15:49,00:15:51,of these legendary treasures is unknown.
00:15:51,00:15:53,And they're intentionally kept from public view.
00:15:53,00:15:55,So Japan's telling us they're real.
00:15:55,00:15:57,We're not allowed to see them.
00:15:57,00:15:59,It's not certain where they're kept.
00:15:59,00:16:01,"And the three treasures are a sword, a mirror,"
00:16:01,00:16:04,and a jewel with special names.
00:16:04,00:16:05,What do we think?
00:16:05,00:16:07,"- I think that's, there must be lots of things"
00:16:07,00:16:10,in this country that we don't know where they are.
00:16:10,00:16:11,"- Yeah, we've never seen. - That we've never seen."
00:16:11,00:16:12,"- Yeah, they must be right."
00:16:12,00:16:13,I don't know what they are.
00:16:13,00:16:15,- Head of MI5.
00:16:15,00:16:16,"- Oh yeah, do they exist?"
00:16:16,00:16:18,"- Oh, you think we have a prop head"
00:16:18,00:16:20,and there's a secret actual head?
00:16:20,00:16:23,"- Yeah, I didn't think until you said that,"
00:16:23,00:16:24,but that's so convincing.
00:16:24,00:16:25,"- It is when you say it, yeah."
00:16:25,00:16:27,"- What's the point, 'cause crown jewels are something"
00:16:27,00:16:29,"that's to show off, isn't it?"
00:16:29,00:16:31,What's the point in having that if no one's allowed to see it?
00:16:31,00:16:32,"- I wonder if in the olden days,"
00:16:32,00:16:35,"you could leverage against it,"
00:16:35,00:16:37,borrow stuff from your barons.
00:16:37,00:16:39,- I bet you could.
00:16:39,00:16:41,- Because I got this really old spoon here.
00:16:41,00:16:45,- Isn't that the last bit of the old crown jewels
00:16:45,00:16:46,that still survives as a spoon?
00:16:46,00:16:48,It's the only one and everything else has been--
00:16:48,00:16:50,"- It all got lost in the wash, didn't it?"
00:16:50,00:16:52,- There was the wash and then there was the Civil War.
00:16:52,00:16:53,"- Not the wash, I'm sorry,"
00:16:53,00:16:55,which is better if I not in a washing machine.
00:16:55,00:16:56,(laughing)
00:16:56,00:16:57,- Sorry.
00:16:57,00:16:59,- We've totally done two high eight.
00:16:59,00:17:00,- Where's the wash again?
00:17:00,00:17:00,Is it Lincolnshire?
00:17:00,00:17:01,"- Off the coast of Norfolk, isn't it?"
00:17:01,00:17:02,"- Oh, it's off the coast."
00:17:02,00:17:03,It does a bit--
00:17:03,00:17:04,"- I don't know, maybe it's Anning Street."
00:17:04,00:17:05,- It does a very marshy bit
00:17:05,00:17:09,and King John supposedly lost the crown jewels in the wash.
00:17:09,00:17:10,Do people still look for it then?
00:17:10,00:17:11,- No.
00:17:11,00:17:12,- Why not?
00:17:12,00:17:13,- I feel like they're not.
00:17:13,00:17:14,"- If we know a specific location,"
00:17:14,00:17:18,I think it's probably a bit bigger than is easily searchable.
00:17:18,00:17:19,"- You're right, there should be detectorists"
00:17:19,00:17:20,that are really--
00:17:20,00:17:21,"- I actually thought detectorists,"
00:17:21,00:17:23,"I kind of assumed that was a place where if you went,"
00:17:23,00:17:25,then you would see lots of detectorists desperately hoping.
00:17:25,00:17:27,- Maybe all the detectorists are just assuming
00:17:27,00:17:29,that all the other detectorists are going for it
00:17:29,00:17:30,"and they're like, oh, that's too obvious,"
00:17:30,00:17:31,I'm gonna look in this field and search.
00:17:31,00:17:33,- They're actually poking out of the ground there.
00:17:33,00:17:34,(laughing)
00:17:34,00:17:36,That could not be easy on a phone.
00:17:36,00:17:39,(upbeat music)
00:17:39,00:17:46,"- Here's one, this is from Eddie Edwards."
00:17:46,00:17:48,"I was, Edward Edwards."
00:17:48,00:17:49,"- Fake name, clearly fake, John."
00:17:49,00:17:51,- I was listening to your audience fact special
00:17:51,00:17:54,and you were talking about that prop nuclear bomb
00:17:54,00:17:55,that was too accurate.
00:17:55,00:17:58,"Well, the fake money used in rush hour two,"
00:17:58,00:18:00,the second rush hour movie.
00:18:00,00:18:01,"Thank you, Eddie."
00:18:01,00:18:03,(laughing)
00:18:03,00:18:06,Was so good that a bunch of people working on the movie
00:18:06,00:18:08,spent some on the Vegas strip
00:18:08,00:18:10,and the secret service ended up getting involved.
00:18:10,00:18:12,It led to a bunch of rules being put in place
00:18:12,00:18:14,about prop money going forward.
00:18:14,00:18:17,- I remember this 'cause they are incredibly strict now.
00:18:17,00:18:19,"- Yeah, great scene in the film as well."
00:18:19,00:18:21,It's a good film rush hour two.
00:18:21,00:18:22,Absolutely decent movie.
00:18:22,00:18:23,- Absolutely.
00:18:23,00:18:26,"- And it ends with this money showering all over the place,"
00:18:26,00:18:29,"you know, the suitcase full of money explodes or whatever."
00:18:29,00:18:31,"And it's this huge, great room they're in"
00:18:31,00:18:32,and the money is going absolutely over.
00:18:32,00:18:35,So I'm sure a load of people could have just pocketed some.
00:18:35,00:18:37,- It's a big thing in films that they worry about on set
00:18:37,00:18:38,when they're using a lot of money.
00:18:38,00:18:39,"And actually, if you look at the money"
00:18:39,00:18:40,"that you have to use in films,"
00:18:40,00:18:42,it looks absolutely nothing like real money.
00:18:42,00:18:45,"It's got to be about 1.5 times the size and have,"
00:18:45,00:18:48,"you know, 'cause they've even done ones like British money"
00:18:48,00:18:50,with kind of a dog instead of the queen on it
00:18:50,00:18:51,"or weird stuff like that, I think."
00:18:51,00:18:53,And they've still said that's too similar
00:18:53,00:18:55,that could be passed off as real money.
00:18:55,00:18:56,"- Very, very rich."
00:18:56,00:18:57,- Has to be so different.
00:18:57,00:18:59,- Can I cheekily pull off a double now?
00:18:59,00:19:01,I just have two thematically very linked ones.
00:19:01,00:19:02,"- Sure, please."
00:19:02,00:19:03,- I thought it might be fun.
00:19:03,00:19:04,"So Lake Berg writes,"
00:19:04,00:19:05,"""I've come across the following."
00:19:05,00:19:07,"""Apollonia was a Christian martyr"
00:19:07,00:19:10,"""who had her teeth pulled out as torture in 249 CE."

00:19:12,00:19:14,"""Unsure how deep-cut this is,"
00:19:14,00:19:16,"""and you've probably looked into saints plenty before,"

00:19:17,00:19:19,"""in the technical field of dentistry"
00:19:19,00:19:21,"""by just having her teeth pulled out."""
00:19:21,00:19:23,"I think that's fair, that's a good point."

00:19:29,00:19:31,"So quite a lot of names flying around,"
00:19:31,00:19:33,"but congratulations, Scott and Doris."
00:19:33,00:19:35,"And hello, David and Katie, who write,"
00:19:35,00:19:37,"""The phenomenon of babies being born"

00:19:50,00:19:52,"- Last piece, duh."
00:19:52,00:19:54,(all laughing)
00:19:54,00:19:57,- How good is that?
00:19:57,00:19:58,"- NB, yes, it's a bit of a stretch"
00:19:58,00:20:00,"because the prevalence varies between studies,"
00:20:00,00:20:02,"but roughly, roughly,"
00:20:02,00:20:05,"what every 2,000, that's stunning."
00:20:05,00:20:06,- That's really good stuff.
00:20:06,00:20:06,"- Lovely, thank you, David."
00:20:06,00:20:08,"- You know what I tried to find the other day,"
00:20:08,00:20:11,"and I couldn't, is a picture of a baby skull."
00:20:11,00:20:12,"You know how babies are born with all their teeth,"
00:20:12,00:20:15,"and then you get photos of baby skulls,"
00:20:15,00:20:18,which do the rounds where you can see all their adult teeth
00:20:18,00:20:20,up in their gums that haven't come down yet.
00:20:20,00:20:23,"But actually, I'm not convinced that those pictures are real."
00:20:23,00:20:26,"There's only about two of them floating around,"
00:20:26,00:20:28,and they don't seem to be very well verified.
00:20:28,00:20:30,"You know, there was one science writer who tweeted one."
00:20:30,00:20:32,So I really want to know if anyone's ever seen
00:20:32,00:20:33,an x-ray of a baby's skull.
00:20:33,00:20:36,"- Yeah, I have a feeling that's not true, that."
00:20:36,00:20:38,"'Cause I wonder if they're smaller at the time,"
00:20:38,00:20:40,and then they grow in your head.
00:20:40,00:20:42,- We're not saying you're not born with all your teeth.
00:20:42,00:20:43,"- No, I think you definitely are born"
00:20:43,00:20:45,"with all your teeth, aren't you, and they descend,"
00:20:45,00:20:47,but maybe they're tiny.
00:20:47,00:20:48,"- They can't, well, they're not full-size, are they?"
00:20:48,00:20:50,"'Cause you've seen a baby, they're small."
00:20:50,00:20:53,The head would be all teeth if they had 32 adult teeth.
00:20:53,00:20:54,"- In the pictures that they show, the head is all teeth."
00:20:54,00:20:56,"Like, it's full-size adult teeth,"
00:20:56,00:21:01,"up in the baby's cheek, it's scary shit."
00:21:01,00:21:02,And I've believed it for years.
00:21:02,00:21:04,"So yeah, please if you've seen an x-ray."
00:21:04,00:21:06,"Yeah, I'm interested that James also thinks maybe it's small."
00:21:06,00:21:08,"- I think it's not, I think some of those are fake pictures."
00:21:08,00:21:11,"I believe, I feel like I've heard that, maybe I have."
00:21:11,00:21:13,- But how do the teeth get in then?
00:21:13,00:21:16,"- They sneak in, and the tooth fairy brings them."
00:21:16,00:21:20,"- I think when you eat more calcium as a baby,"
00:21:20,00:21:22,"for the first seven years of your life,"
00:21:22,00:21:25,"you take in the calcium, and that helps them to grow."
00:21:25,00:21:28,The same way that you don't have kneecaps and stuff like that.
00:21:28,00:21:30,"- Right, and then all the milk gives you all the calcium?"
00:21:30,00:21:31,- Yeah.
00:21:31,00:21:32,- There we go.
00:21:32,00:21:33,"- I think, I can't really."
00:21:33,00:21:34,"- Wow, that would be blowing a shit wide open,"
00:21:34,00:21:38,'cause I've seen that image of a side profile of a baby's girl.
00:21:38,00:21:38,- Indeed.
00:21:38,00:21:40,"- God, that's incredible, it's all tooth."
00:21:40,00:21:41,"- Yeah, disgusting."
00:21:41,00:21:43,"- The whole tooth, nothing but the tooth."
00:21:43,00:21:44,- It was when I showed that.
00:21:44,00:21:45,(laughing)
00:21:45,00:21:47,- Jesus.
00:21:47,00:21:49,"- So anyway, if you know about that stuff,"
00:21:49,00:21:51,'cause we are speculating a little bit here.
00:21:51,00:21:52,"- Absolutely, please tell us."
00:21:52,00:21:54,- To podcast.qa.com.
00:21:54,00:21:57,"- This is a fact from Andrew Kirkland,"
00:21:57,00:21:59,and Tee just says that his favorite fact this week
00:21:59,00:22:00,"is that according to Wikipedia,"
00:22:00,00:22:03,"the Irish invented whiskey in the 14th century,"
00:22:03,00:22:04,and then they didn't invent anything else
00:22:04,00:22:07,"for another 300 years, and."
00:22:07,00:22:08,- That's understandable.
00:22:08,00:22:09,- He's got a point.
00:22:09,00:22:12,"- Well, exactly, you've reached your peak, haven't you?"
00:22:12,00:22:15,"And it's true, the Wikipedia page on Irish inventions"
00:22:15,00:22:17,"does have a 14th century section,"
00:22:17,00:22:19,where they have three inventions.
00:22:19,00:22:22,They have the Precursor to Modern Gaelic Football.
00:22:22,00:22:26,"They have the Northern Reginians Anthem,"
00:22:26,00:22:28,"a huge invention, I think we can all agree,"
00:22:28,00:22:32,"and whiskey, and the next invention is 17th century."
00:22:32,00:22:33,- And what was that?
00:22:33,00:22:33,- Good point you asked.
00:22:33,00:22:37,(all laughing)
00:22:37,00:22:39,"- You don't know it's the whiskey that did it,"
00:22:39,00:22:42,"it might be the Northern Reginians Anthem, it's so catchy."
00:22:42,00:22:44,Everyone was seeing it for the next 300 years.
00:22:44,00:22:46,(all laughing)
00:22:46,00:22:49,- I have a whiskey related one.
00:22:49,00:22:50,- There you are.
00:22:50,00:22:52,"- Okay, so this is from Chris Patterson,"
00:22:52,00:22:55,and he thinks that he might be the first outside voice
00:22:55,00:22:57,to be ever heard on noses and things of fish.
00:22:57,00:22:59,"- Chris Patterson, the former governor of Hong Kong."
00:22:59,00:23:00,"- Sorry, that's Chris."
00:23:00,00:23:01,- Chris Patterson.
00:23:01,00:23:02,"- Yeah, okay."
00:23:02,00:23:02,- Carry on.
00:23:02,00:23:04,- Maybe his son.
00:23:04,00:23:04,- Yes.
00:23:04,00:23:08,(all laughing)
00:23:08,00:23:09,- Can you remember?
00:23:09,00:23:10,"So this was someone,"
00:23:10,00:23:12,we did a live show and this person shouted out.
00:23:12,00:23:13,- Okay.
00:23:13,00:23:14,- We were in Scandinavia somewhere.
00:23:14,00:23:16,Can you remember anyone who shouted out in Scandinavia?
00:23:16,00:23:17,- Where did we go?
00:23:17,00:23:18,"We went Gothenburg, and we went Stockholm."
00:23:18,00:23:20,- I think it was in Gothenburg.
00:23:20,00:23:21,- Gothenburg.
00:23:21,00:23:24,"- Oh no, in Stockholm, he says it in the email."
00:23:24,00:23:26,- I can't remember.
00:23:26,00:23:28,- Did they shout out something other than--
00:23:28,00:23:31,"- Yeah, so we were discussing cyborgs"
00:23:31,00:23:33,and asked in the audience if there were any cyborgs
00:23:33,00:23:36,"in the crowd, and he got to shout out I'm a cyborg."
00:23:36,00:23:40,And this is 'cause he had an RFID chip
00:23:40,00:23:41,put into his body.
00:23:41,00:23:43,"You know, like you could get a little chip in your body"
00:23:43,00:23:46,so you could use it as a credit card or something.
00:23:46,00:23:49,"Anyway, he never got to tell us the whole story that time,"
00:23:49,00:23:51,but I've got the whole story here.
00:23:51,00:23:53,"He went to an event called Chips and Whiskey,"
00:23:53,00:23:56,thinking that it was potato crisps and alcohol
00:23:56,00:23:57,that he was gonna get.
00:23:59,00:24:01,"But in fact, it was someone giving you these implants,"
00:24:01,00:24:03,"and he said after a few whiskies,"
00:24:03,00:24:04,"it seemed like a good idea,"
00:24:04,00:24:06,and I got the largest needle I have ever seen
00:24:06,00:24:08,injecting a chip into my hand.
00:24:08,00:24:13,I've used this as a gym card and not much more.
00:24:13,00:24:15,- That's so great.
00:24:15,00:24:16,- Do you know what was that guy called?
00:24:16,00:24:18,- Chris Patton's son.
00:24:18,00:24:19,- Of course.
00:24:19,00:24:21,I've always thought those people all got chips
00:24:21,00:24:23,"and started to kind of card douchebags, to be honest,"
00:24:23,00:24:27,"but that is the best excuse for doing it, I've ever heard."
00:24:27,00:24:28,- I almost got one.
00:24:28,00:24:30,"- Exactly, exactly my point."
00:24:30,00:24:32,- Moving on.
00:24:32,00:24:33,"- Well, I did, years ago,"
00:24:33,00:24:36,"I did this little taster tape that was filmed,"
00:24:36,00:24:39,"whereby it was looking into all of this world of cyborgs,"
00:24:39,00:24:42,"and as part of it, they wanted to put a chip into me,"
00:24:42,00:24:43,"and then right at the last minute,"
00:24:43,00:24:45,"they had someone come in with the device,"
00:24:45,00:24:49,and the health and safety didn't allow
00:24:49,00:24:51,"for the chip itself to go in,"
00:24:51,00:24:54,but they still injected me with the thing to put it in.
00:24:54,00:24:56,It's so painful.
00:24:56,00:25:00,"So I was filmed as the process as if I had the chip in me,"
00:25:00,00:25:01,and then I had to--
00:25:01,00:25:02,- What did they put in there?
00:25:02,00:25:03,"- Nothing, it was just empty."
00:25:03,00:25:04,- So they say.
00:25:04,00:25:05,"- Yeah, but yeah, they still,"
00:25:05,00:25:07,and then I had to sit there and pretend
00:25:07,00:25:10,"that I was turning a lamp on with my hand,"
00:25:10,00:25:12,"and they, like we're talking about with the queen"
00:25:12,00:25:14,"having someone press the button,"
00:25:14,00:25:16,"there was someone on the floor, out of shot,"
00:25:16,00:25:18,"pressing the button of the lamp flickering,"
00:25:18,00:25:20,"as I was going, ""Look at me, I'm a cyborg."""
00:25:20,00:25:24,"- Wow, TV is full of lies, isn't it?"
00:25:24,00:25:26,You and David Attenborough.
00:25:26,00:25:27,"I just, I can't believe with you, Dan,"
00:25:27,00:25:29,"that however many years I know you,"
00:25:29,00:25:32,there's always a new anecdote that I've never heard.
00:25:32,00:25:33,- I'll do one now.
00:25:33,00:25:37,"Derek Bailey writes,"

00:26:13,00:26:16,"""They were creating phosphorescence,"
00:26:16,00:26:18,"""which was drawing the squid to the surface"
00:26:18,00:26:20,"""and there was their buffet."""
00:26:20,00:26:21,- Cool. - Lovely.
00:26:21,00:26:24,"- Like monster flames. - Very cool, Derek Bailey."
00:26:24,00:26:26,- How are they creating phosphorescence
00:26:26,00:26:27,"with their feet, Derek Bailey?"
00:26:27,00:26:30,"- Well, you get those little sort of bacteria and stuff"
00:26:30,00:26:32,and algae that live in the water
00:26:32,00:26:34,"and when you move your hands and make waves,"
00:26:34,00:26:35,they light up. - I see.
00:26:35,00:26:36,- You get them in Mexico.
00:26:36,00:26:37,- Do you remember that more thing?
00:26:37,00:26:40,- The trails of ships can sometimes glow.
00:26:40,00:26:42,"- Yes, I know, I know, but I didn't realise"
00:26:42,00:26:43,that another animal who didn't have it
00:26:43,00:26:45,could deliberately would swish it up.
00:26:45,00:26:46,"- Oh, it's just water churning, isn't it?"
00:26:46,00:26:48,"- Yeah, isn't it? - Yeah, very cool."
00:26:48,00:26:51,"- Actually, 'cause I was walking on a beach in Hobart"
00:26:51,00:26:52,"in Tasmania a couple of years ago,"
00:26:52,00:26:53,I've never seen anything like it.
00:26:53,00:26:56,It was at night time and as you put your foot down
00:26:56,00:26:59,"on the sand, it glowed fluorescent blue all around you."
00:26:59,00:27:01,It was absolutely extraordinary.
00:27:01,00:27:02,"- Wow, it's like avatar."
00:27:02,00:27:03,That's very cool.
00:27:03,00:27:04,- Is that what happens in avatar?
00:27:04,00:27:05,"- I actually can't remember, Andy."
00:27:05,00:27:07,- Yeah. - There we go.
00:27:07,00:27:09,- It actually reminded me more of those disco pads
00:27:09,00:27:12,"where if you step on a glowing bit,"
00:27:12,00:27:13,a bit glows and you step on it.
00:27:13,00:27:16,"- Those dance machines, I used to love those things."
00:27:16,00:27:18,"Oh my God, I used to love them so much."
00:27:18,00:27:19,"- Oh, they're good."
00:27:19,00:27:20,I still do the occasional dance.
00:27:20,00:27:21,"- Yeah, if I'm passing an arcade."
00:27:21,00:27:24,"- God, is that right?"
00:27:24,00:27:26,'Cause I find them very exhausting.
00:27:26,00:27:27,"- Oh, the tiring, yeah."
00:27:27,00:27:29,"- I guess probably you're a bit younger than me, but yeah."
00:27:29,00:27:30,"- Well, no, it's tiring."
00:27:30,00:27:32,"- How do you, was it, you both still do dance?"
00:27:32,00:27:34,"- No, I haven't done it for years, no."
00:27:34,00:27:37,"But like, would you hold onto the bars when you did it"
00:27:37,00:27:38,or were you like hardcore?
00:27:38,00:27:40,"- No, I don't think I do."
00:27:40,00:27:42,- Is that like having the walls up in Berlin?
00:27:42,00:27:44,(all laughing)
00:27:44,00:27:45,- Exactly.
00:27:45,00:27:48,"- When's the last time you did it, Andy?"
00:27:48,00:27:49,- I would say within the last year.
00:27:49,00:27:51,"- On your own, walking past an arcade."
00:27:51,00:27:53,- With my wife.
00:27:53,00:27:54,We went to a video game arcade.
00:27:54,00:27:55,"- Okay, that's different."
00:27:55,00:27:58,- Did you do it where you were like on the same team?
00:27:58,00:27:59,- She didn't participate.
00:27:59,00:28:01,(all laughing)
00:28:01,00:28:02,She didn't want to.
00:28:02,00:28:04,"She said, ""I'll just watch you, darling."""
00:28:04,00:28:06,- I want you to take on that nine-year-old.
00:28:06,00:28:08,(all laughing)
00:28:08,00:28:09,- Yeah.
00:28:09,00:28:10,"- No, it was really fun."
00:28:10,00:28:11,It was really fun.
00:28:11,00:28:12,It was a video game bar.
00:28:12,00:28:14,A video game sort of bar slash arcade thing.
00:28:14,00:28:15,"I wasn't drinking obviously, but."
00:28:15,00:28:18,"- No, your wife ordered three large vodkas at the bar."
00:28:19,00:28:21,- Do you guys remember that great story
00:28:21,00:28:23,about Jim Lovell from Apollo 13?
00:28:23,00:28:27,So obviously the story of Apollo 13 is insane.
00:28:27,00:28:29,They break down in space on the way to the moon.
00:28:29,00:28:30,They need to get back.
00:28:30,00:28:32,But he had a situation back on Earth
00:28:32,00:28:35,when he was a fighter pilot that was equally as dangerous.
00:28:35,00:28:38,"He was on his plane over the sea, got lost"
00:28:38,00:28:41,and managed last minute to find his way back
00:28:41,00:28:42,to the ship to land on
00:28:42,00:28:44,because he followed the trail of phosphorescence
00:28:44,00:28:46,that was being left in the wake of the ship.
00:28:46,00:28:47,- I thought that was what you were referencing.
00:28:47,00:28:50,"Yeah, it was when he was landing on aircraft carrier,"
00:28:50,00:28:51,wasn't he?
00:28:51,00:28:52,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:28:52,00:28:52,- Yeah.
00:28:52,00:28:53,"- Astonishing, very cool."
00:28:53,00:28:55,So where did the dance mat fit into that?
00:28:55,00:28:56,(all laughing)
00:28:56,00:28:57,Once he got out.
00:28:57,00:29:00,(all laughing)
00:29:00,00:29:01,"All right, here's one."
00:29:01,00:29:04,Alexis Beckett from British Columbia.
00:29:04,00:29:05,I'm a long time listener.
00:29:05,00:29:06,"I've never written him before,"
00:29:06,00:29:07,"but for some reason,"
00:29:07,00:29:10,Andy Demarney we do persuaded me this Saturday afternoon.
00:29:10,00:29:11,"Hmm, I think."
00:29:11,00:29:13,I had nothing good to say.
00:29:13,00:29:14,(all laughing)
00:29:14,00:29:15,- Welcome to the podcast recording mate.
00:29:15,00:29:17,(all laughing)
00:29:17,00:29:18,So I reached for a weird fact.
00:29:18,00:29:20,"I remember being told in high school,"
00:29:20,00:29:24,"in the Yukon, it's illegal to push a moose"
00:29:24,00:29:26,from an airplane in flight.
00:29:26,00:29:27,It's also illegal to watch a moose
00:29:27,00:29:29,be pushed from an airplane in flight.
00:29:29,00:29:31,"I'm not certain whether this is accurate,"
00:29:31,00:29:33,but I've always found it entertaining
00:29:33,00:29:34,and we shouldn't let the truth
00:29:34,00:29:36,get in the way of a good story.
00:29:36,00:29:37,"Thank you, Alexis."
00:29:37,00:29:38,"- That feels a bit cheat, right?"
00:29:38,00:29:40,"- Yeah, I don't know, Andy."
00:29:40,00:29:41,That doesn't sound true.
00:29:41,00:29:44,- It would be hard to prosecute people who've watched it.
00:29:44,00:29:47,Now the prosecution is gonna bring in some witnesses.
00:29:47,00:29:50,(all laughing)
00:29:50,00:29:54,"- Yeah, okay."
00:29:54,00:29:55,"No, it's almost certainly nonsense, isn't it?"
00:29:55,00:29:56,"Thank you Alexis, regardless."
00:29:56,00:29:57,"- Yeah, it doesn't feel like it."
00:29:57,00:29:58,- Nice try.
00:29:58,00:30:00,"From James Milne, everyone knows he says,"
00:30:00,00:30:02,"and I think he's correct,"
00:30:02,00:30:05,"that Oslo gifts a tree to London for Christmas every year,"
00:30:05,00:30:07,"which it does, has done since World War II."
00:30:07,00:30:09,"But James Milne says,"
00:30:09,00:30:11,it's not the only tree gifted to a British city
00:30:11,00:30:13,from a Norwegian city.
00:30:13,00:30:13,And I didn't know this.
00:30:13,00:30:17,The city of Bergen gifts a tree to Newcastle every year as well.
00:30:17,00:30:19,Also in recognition of World War II.
00:30:19,00:30:24,"And it's because Oslo started gifting London this tree,"
00:30:24,00:30:26,and other parts of Norway wanted to recognise
00:30:26,00:30:27,it wasn't just London.
00:30:27,00:30:30,It was the whole of the UK that contributed to World War II.
00:30:30,00:30:32,And so actually there were quite a lot of cities in the UK
00:30:32,00:30:34,that get free trees from Norway.
00:30:34,00:30:38,"There's Grimsbury, Edinburgh, Orkney, Shetland."
00:30:38,00:30:40,- Grimsby.
00:30:40,00:30:40,- What did I say?
00:30:40,00:30:41,- Grimsbury.
00:30:41,00:30:42,- Grimsbury.
00:30:42,00:30:43,- Grimsbury.
00:30:43,00:30:44,- That's a local cheese limit.
00:30:44,00:30:47,(laughing)
00:30:47,00:30:50,- That is a really good fact.
00:30:50,00:30:51,"- Yeah, I can know that."
00:30:51,00:30:53,"- It also is, people always complain"
00:30:53,00:30:55,"about the Trafalgar Square Tree,"
00:30:55,00:30:58,because it's this particular kind of coniferous tree
00:30:58,00:30:59,that the Norwegians send over.
00:30:59,00:31:01,And it doesn't look as glossy
00:31:01,00:31:03,as some of the really thick branched trees.
00:31:03,00:31:04,"People say, ""Oh, it looks so scraggy."""
00:31:04,00:31:05,"And you just think, ""Learn some history."""
00:31:05,00:31:06,"You know, it's the--"
00:31:06,00:31:10,- But I also think they put some not very good lights on it.
00:31:10,00:31:11,"You know, like when you do your tree,"
00:31:11,00:31:13,you put like baubles in really nice places.
00:31:13,00:31:14,You've got tinsel all the way around.
00:31:14,00:31:16,"They just kind of hang it from the top,"
00:31:16,00:31:17,these sort of lights coming down.
00:31:17,00:31:19,"- They just do some strings down, don't they?"
00:31:19,00:31:20,"- Yes, I think it looks crap."
00:31:20,00:31:21,"- That's probably us, though."
00:31:21,00:31:22,I'm sure we do the lights.
00:31:22,00:31:24,"- Oh yeah, I'm not playing in the Norwegians for that."
00:31:24,00:31:26,But I just think they don't help themselves.
00:31:26,00:31:28,"- Yeah, I've always thought that."
00:31:28,00:31:30,You've got to embed the lights.
00:31:30,00:31:31,They're not for draping.
00:31:31,00:31:32,- Yeah.
00:31:32,00:31:33,- It's mad.
00:31:33,00:31:34,- Probably a health and safety thing.
00:31:34,00:31:36,"Just on war thanks things,"
00:31:36,00:31:40,"when we were on tour in Australia,"
00:31:40,00:31:41,"not so long ago,"
00:31:41,00:31:43,"we went to Melbourne,"
00:31:43,00:31:46,"and I had a day of sightseeing before the show,"
00:31:46,00:31:50,and Melbourne has a present that the British provided
00:31:50,00:31:53,in thanks for years of support during total war.
00:31:53,00:31:56,Britain gave Australia a small model village.
00:31:56,00:31:57,- Really?
00:31:57,00:31:59,"- Yeah, and you can walk around it now."
00:31:59,00:32:00,- That's fantastic.
00:32:00,00:32:01,Of what village?
00:32:01,00:32:01,"- Which village, yeah."
00:32:01,00:32:02,- It's a generic village.
00:32:02,00:32:04,"So there's, you know, the Shakespeare Arms Pub,"
00:32:04,00:32:06,and there's a little post office.
00:32:06,00:32:07,"But honestly, you go there and you think,"
00:32:07,00:32:09,this is not a good thank you present
00:32:09,00:32:11,after quite a lot of sacrifice.
00:32:11,00:32:14,"- Well, everyone loves a model village."
00:32:14,00:32:15,- Yeah.
00:32:15,00:32:16,- Yeah.
00:32:16,00:32:17,What's an appropriate thank you for you.
00:32:17,00:32:19,"After six years of support during total war,"
00:32:19,00:32:21,I'm trying to dance that.
00:32:21,00:32:24,That's a good point.
00:32:24,00:32:26,Maybe Melbourne really wanted a model village.
00:32:26,00:32:27,But it's very sweet.
00:32:27,00:32:28,It's really sweet.
00:32:28,00:32:29,"If you're anywhere near Melbourne,"
00:32:29,00:32:30,you've got to check it out.
00:32:30,00:32:32,- That is quite strange.
00:32:32,00:32:32,What was it?
00:32:32,00:32:34,Do you remember that thing where there was a gift exchange
00:32:34,00:32:36,between Gordon Brown and Barack Obama?
00:32:36,00:32:38,And Barack Obama like?
00:32:38,00:32:40,"- Gordon Brown gave Barack Obama an incredibly beautiful,"
00:32:40,00:32:43,I think it was a pen holder carved from the wood
00:32:43,00:32:46,of an anti-slaving ship after Britain outlawed slavery
00:32:46,00:32:49,and was cracking down on the illegal slave trade.
00:32:49,00:32:50,So it's very symbolic.
00:32:50,00:32:53,And Obama gave Gordon Brown a bag of DVD.
00:32:53,00:32:55,"- A shower too, I think."
00:32:55,00:32:57,- Which were in the wrong zone
00:32:57,00:32:59,to be played on British DVD players.
00:32:59,00:33:00,A golden age of translates.
00:33:00,00:33:02,"Obama's one misstep, I'd say."
00:33:02,00:33:04,"- Yeah, absolutely."
00:33:04,00:33:06,"Just actually, can I say it on war related gifts?"
00:33:06,00:33:11,"- Gernica, the battle started by Pablo Picasso."
00:33:11,00:33:15,- Just so that he had something to paint.
00:33:15,00:33:17,"- Exactly, you know."
00:33:17,00:33:19,You've got to create your material sometimes.
00:33:19,00:33:22,"No, Gernica was a battle in the Spanish Civil War."
00:33:22,00:33:24,The Spanish right wing side had a lot of help
00:33:24,00:33:26,from fellow fascists from Italy and Germany.
00:33:26,00:33:29,And the reason the Nazis got involved
00:33:29,00:33:33,was because it was a birthday present to Hitler
00:33:33,00:33:35,from the head of the Luftwaffe
00:33:35,00:33:37,who I think was it going?
00:33:37,00:33:39,"It was going, had a Luftwaffe."
00:33:39,00:33:40,"Yeah, so it was a happy birthday."
00:33:40,00:33:41,And actually it really fucked up
00:33:41,00:33:43,because the weather screwed it up.
00:33:43,00:33:45,So it had to be delayed by about five days.
00:33:45,00:33:46,So if you look at the dates of Hitler's birthday
00:33:46,00:33:48,"and the dates of Gernica,"
00:33:48,00:33:49,"they were five days late,"
00:33:49,00:33:50,but apparently Hitler was very understanding about that.
00:33:50,00:33:53,"- Yeah, I mean, sometimes you can't have your birthday party"
00:33:53,00:33:54,"on the day of your birthday, can you?"
00:33:54,00:33:56,"- Exactly, you've got to wait till the weekend."
00:33:56,00:33:57,- It's on a Tuesday.
00:33:57,00:34:01,That's a callback to last week's show.
00:34:01,00:34:04,- The Luftwaffe's involvement in a battle
00:34:04,00:34:05,was a birthday present.
00:34:05,00:34:07,"- Yeah, because I think Gary knew"
00:34:07,00:34:08,that Hitler would be really pleased.
00:34:08,00:34:10,And it was like a surprise.
00:34:10,00:34:11,"You know, I decided to get it built."
00:34:11,00:34:12,- Did they arrive in a giant cake?
00:34:12,00:34:13,- They came out of a cake.
00:34:13,00:34:14,- They came out of a cake.
00:34:14,00:34:16,"- Yeah, flew out of a cake, yeah."
00:34:16,00:34:19,"- Here's a fact from Mark Weiberd,"
00:34:19,00:34:21,after whom the play bus stop is named.
00:34:21,00:34:24,That's a bit of a niche one.
00:34:24,00:34:25,People of a certain age.
00:34:25,00:34:27,There was a kid's show called Play Bus
00:34:27,00:34:29,and they had the Weiberd stop.
00:34:29,00:34:32,"Anyway, Mark Weiberd says,"
00:34:32,00:34:34,"""There is a recently completed Australian legal case"
00:34:34,00:34:37,"""establishing an important legal principle"
00:34:37,00:34:40,"""that is called Tickle versus Giggle."""
00:34:40,00:34:42,- Come on.
00:34:42,00:34:44,"- He says, ""It is important and serious"
00:34:44,00:34:46,"""for reasons of establishing trans rights,"
00:34:46,00:34:50,"""but it is purely the name that makes me smile."""
00:34:50,00:34:51,- Do we get any more details?
00:34:51,00:34:53,"Or is it like, details too dry and serious?"
00:34:53,00:34:54,"Name, very funny."
00:34:54,00:34:55,- I don't have any more details.
00:34:55,00:34:57,It feels like it would be dry and serious.
00:34:57,00:34:58,But Tickle versus Giggle.
00:34:58,00:34:59,"- Tickle versus Giggle, lovely."
00:34:59,00:35:02,"- I wonder who's the good guy there, Tickle or Giggle?"
00:35:02,00:35:03,- Tickle.
00:35:03,00:35:05,"- Gotta be Giggle, Tickle is a bad guy always, right?"
00:35:05,00:35:07,- Mr. Tickle.
00:35:07,00:35:08,"- Yeah, no one likes being tickled."
00:35:08,00:35:09,- He's a good guy.
00:35:09,00:35:11,He's misunderstood.
00:35:11,00:35:12,"- What about John Tickle,"
00:35:12,00:35:16,the ex-big brother housemate who then went on
00:35:16,00:35:18,to do gadget shows?
00:35:18,00:35:19,- Yes.
00:35:19,00:35:20,- There's quite a lot of amazing niche references
00:35:20,00:35:21,coming in one.
00:35:21,00:35:25,- I reckon AI could just listen to me
00:35:25,00:35:27,in the last 10 minutes and work out exactly
00:35:27,00:35:30,"when I was born, but John Tickle."
00:35:30,00:35:32,"- John Tickle, I always remember what I liked."
00:35:32,00:35:35,I think this was his first so-called invention
00:35:35,00:35:37,after big brother was the toaster.
00:35:37,00:35:39,Do you remember the toaster that delays
00:35:39,00:35:40,the second bit of toast?
00:35:40,00:35:42,"So you put it down, but it doesn't start cooking"
00:35:42,00:35:44,the second bit of toast until your first one's ready.
00:35:44,00:35:45,Very sensible.
00:35:45,00:35:46,"I don't know, 'cause you're always gonna deal"
00:35:46,00:35:48,with the second cold bit of toast.
00:35:48,00:35:49,- Yes.
00:35:49,00:35:50,- Where is he now?
00:35:50,00:35:50,- Where is he?
00:35:50,00:35:51,- John Tickle.
00:35:51,00:35:53,"- Well, you can retire after that toast moment, can't you?"
00:35:53,00:35:54,- Really?
00:35:54,00:35:55,- 'Cause we've all got one now.
00:35:55,00:35:57,"We've really shaken off any international listeners,"
00:35:57,00:35:58,I think.
00:35:58,00:36:07,- I've got one here from Nina de Villiers.
00:36:07,00:36:09,Long time listener of the podcast.
00:36:09,00:36:11,I used to work on seahorses.
00:36:11,00:36:14,- On seahorses.
00:36:14,00:36:17,"- Very, very small wet grad national."
00:36:17,00:36:18,- That's how I broke my hymen.
00:36:18,00:36:25,"- In South Africa, actually, I should say,"
00:36:25,00:36:26,how would you pronounce that?
00:36:26,00:36:27,- Ooh.
00:36:27,00:36:28,- South Africa.
00:36:28,00:36:35,"- I wouldn't, I'd guess canizna, I think."
00:36:35,00:36:36,"- Okay, canizna."
00:36:36,00:36:37,"So I used to work on seahorses and canizna,"
00:36:37,00:36:39,"and a while back, I learned from a colleague"
00:36:39,00:36:41,that seahorses make vocalizations.
00:36:41,00:36:45,"They make clicking noises during courtship and feeding,"
00:36:45,00:36:47,but they also growl to startle predators.
00:36:47,00:36:49,This is followed by quivering their bodies.
00:36:49,00:36:51,"At one point, there was research investigating seahorses"
00:36:51,00:36:54,to determine where the sound were produced.
00:36:54,00:36:56,I briefly got involved by taking a dried seahorse
00:36:56,00:36:58,to be scanned at our local hospital
00:36:58,00:37:00,in the X-ray and CT machine.
00:37:00,00:37:02,"Other than a very cool looking scan,"
00:37:02,00:37:04,where you could see all of its baby teeth.
00:37:04,00:37:07,(all laughing)
00:37:07,00:37:09,I'm not actually sure it helped the researcher.
00:37:09,00:37:12,"But she took it, yeah."
00:37:12,00:37:14,"- But it did help the hospital waiting list,"
00:37:14,00:37:16,"the queue of ambulances outside,"
00:37:16,00:37:18,waiting for you to scan your seahorse.
00:37:18,00:37:21,"- This is a very recondite one, I love it."
00:37:21,00:37:24,"It's from Isabelle Starling, in relation to Mark Weibert."
00:37:24,00:37:28,Something fun I heard the other day.
00:37:28,00:37:31,"William Jones, the man generally credited"
00:37:31,00:37:33,with the use of the Greek letter pi
00:37:33,00:37:37,"for the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter,"
00:37:37,00:37:41,"was the father of William Jones, another William Jones,"
00:37:41,00:37:43,one of the first to suggest the existence
00:37:43,00:37:48,of the Proto-Indo-European language known as pi.
00:37:48,00:37:51,"- Oh, very good. - In no way!"
00:37:51,00:37:52,- How good is that?
00:37:52,00:37:54,"- Hang on, is that a coincidence?"
00:37:54,00:37:56,"What, is it one of the names after the other?"
00:37:56,00:37:57,"- No, it looks like a--"
00:37:57,00:37:59,- 'Cause why do we call pi pi?
00:37:59,00:38:00,- Because after the letter.
00:38:00,00:38:02,"- Just the letter, that's just how far we've got."
00:38:02,00:38:05,'Cause you don't hear all the alpha to--
00:38:05,00:38:07,"- No, there is a reason, there is a reason."
00:38:07,00:38:08,I can't remember what it is.
00:38:08,00:38:10,"- Yeah. - Wow, that's amazing."
00:38:10,00:38:12,"- I think that's a cracking fact, thank you, Isabelle."
00:38:12,00:38:13,She finishes her email.
00:38:13,00:38:15,I also discovered that Shirley Ballas'
00:38:15,00:38:17,ex-father-in-law invented the strimmer.
00:38:17,00:38:20,Although I suspect that one is only interesting to me.
00:38:20,00:38:21,"- Yeah, I like it."
00:38:21,00:38:23,"- Yeah, and for international listeners,"
00:38:23,00:38:25,"Shirley, I can't explain Shirley Ballas."
00:38:25,00:38:29,"- There's no one left, there is no international listener left."
00:38:29,00:38:30,"- I don't know who that is, so please."
00:38:30,00:38:31,- She's on strictly.
00:38:31,00:38:32,- Former dancer.
00:38:32,00:38:35,"- Got it, asking if Shirley Bassie, got it."
00:38:35,00:38:36,All right.
00:38:36,00:38:39,This is from a guy called Matt Lowry.
00:38:39,00:38:42,A new pre-print by some folks at the University of Pennsylvania
00:38:42,00:38:44,claims we can use resus macaques
00:38:44,00:38:46,to predict the winner of elections.
00:38:46,00:38:48,And it's a pretty interesting discussion
00:38:48,00:38:51,"about behavioral neuro-economics, is it now?"
00:38:51,00:38:54,But it's basically judging on how long
00:38:54,00:38:56,they look at each candidate.
00:38:56,00:39:01,He also says that the area of behavioral neuro-economics
00:39:01,00:39:04,is a field in a bit of crisis at the moment.
00:39:04,00:39:06,"So I think actually, 'cause he works in that field,"
00:39:06,00:39:08,he's just angling for some funding.
00:39:08,00:39:11,"But there you go, how long a resus macaque"
00:39:11,00:39:12,looks at a candidate?
00:39:12,00:39:14,"I guess it must mean they're more likely to win,"
00:39:14,00:39:15,although he doesn't specify.
00:39:15,00:39:19,"- So do you reckon if you want to be president,"
00:39:19,00:39:21,"if you sell a table load of bananas to your face,"
00:39:21,00:39:23,(all laughing)
00:39:23,00:39:24,that gives you more of a chance?
00:39:24,00:39:25,- That'll do it.
00:39:25,00:39:26,(all laughing)
00:39:26,00:39:28,"- I can think of a conch, he's all right with mine, yeah."
00:39:28,00:39:31,"- We've seen worse candidates, that's all I'm saying."
00:39:31,00:39:33,"- Meanwhile, the Swedish minister of equality's going,"
00:39:33,00:39:34,"""No!"""
00:39:34,00:39:37,(all laughing)
00:39:37,00:39:39,"- Two week call, like, lovely."
00:39:39,00:39:41,(all laughing)
00:39:41,00:39:43,"- He, oh well, here we go."
00:39:43,00:39:46,"He says, so the paper's filled with a number of amusing quotes,"
00:39:46,00:39:47,"such as, ""Here we show that resus macaques"
00:39:47,00:39:50,"""who have no knowledge about political candidates,"
00:39:50,00:39:53,"""all their policies implicitly predict the outcome."""
00:39:53,00:39:55,Why would they predict the outcome?
00:39:55,00:39:56,"- So is it different though,"
00:39:56,00:39:58,when they do understand their policies?
00:39:58,00:40:00,"- If they've read the manifesto,"
00:40:00,00:40:03,"then yeah, it does change their responses."
00:40:03,00:40:05,"""Implicitly predict the outcomes of U.S."
00:40:05,00:40:07,"""a gubernatorial and senatorial elections"

00:40:18,00:40:19,"I don't know which they prefer,"
00:40:19,00:40:20,he doesn't say which they prefer.
00:40:20,00:40:21,"- Oh, wide or narrow, draw bones."
00:40:21,00:40:24,"Oh, probably wide, nice wide cheekbones, you know."
00:40:24,00:40:27,"- Wide jaw, gotta be, yeah."
00:40:27,00:40:30,"Well done macaques, let's just get them to vote."
00:40:30,00:40:33,"- Isabella Remet writes,"
00:40:33,00:40:35,"""At the Gothenburg Universium,"
00:40:35,00:40:38,"""we support mantle of universe and museum,"

00:40:46,00:40:49,"""blasts in the rock."""
00:40:49,00:40:49,- Aw.
00:40:49,00:40:51,"- So they've got a warning text,"
00:40:51,00:40:52,"like when someone comes around the cafe saying,"
00:40:52,00:40:55,"""We're doing a fire alarm, it's just an alarm."""
00:40:55,00:40:57,"- Like when the government sends you a message saying,"
00:40:57,00:40:59,"""This is a test alert."""
00:40:59,00:41:03,"Honestly, it's fine, there's no nuclear weapons on the way."
00:41:03,00:41:05,It's just a test.
00:41:05,00:41:06,"- I mean, we've obviously got no more to go on here,"
00:41:06,00:41:09,but I wonder what the text says.
00:41:09,00:41:11,(all laughing)
00:41:11,00:41:14,"Probably in Swedish, who says da-da."
00:41:14,00:41:16,(all laughing)
00:41:16,00:41:18,"And also would you not get, if I was a shark,"
00:41:18,00:41:20,I would think a text message would scare me quite a bit.
00:41:20,00:41:21,"- That would be very scary, yeah, yeah."
00:41:21,00:41:23,"- I just don't work on the water phones, do they?"
00:41:23,00:41:25,- You get these really cool packets
00:41:25,00:41:28,so you can put them in now with a pouch.
00:41:28,00:41:29,- Yeah.
00:41:29,00:41:30,"- I mean, I keep my genitals in mind,"
00:41:30,00:41:32,but that's for a time as well.
00:41:32,00:41:36,(all laughing)
00:41:36,00:41:36,- Whose turn is it?
00:41:36,00:41:37,"- Oh, it's my turn."
00:41:37,00:41:39,"So thank you, that was a good one."
00:41:39,00:41:41,"- Antonio Mantica says,"
00:41:41,00:41:44,"""Just finished listening to episode 559"
00:41:44,00:41:46,where you mentioned that the Catholic diocese
00:41:46,00:41:48,of Orlando claims jurisdiction over the moon
00:41:48,00:41:51,since that's where Apollo 11 launched from.
00:41:51,00:41:53,"I'm surprised nobody, brackets Dan,"
00:41:53,00:41:55,"didn't mention that Buzz Aldrin,"
00:41:55,00:41:58,a Texas freemason established a Masonic lodge
00:41:58,00:42:00,"on the moon called Tranquility Lodge,"
00:42:00,00:42:04,a number 2000 under the Grand Lodge of Texas
00:42:04,00:42:07,who now claim Masonic jurisdiction to the moon.
00:42:07,00:42:08,"According to their official website,"
00:42:08,00:42:11,meetings are held quarterly in various cities around Texas
00:42:11,00:42:13,until such time as the lodge may hold
00:42:13,00:42:14,its meetings on the moon itself.
00:42:14,00:42:18,"Can I just say, I did randomly select these things"
00:42:18,00:42:19,out of the pile.
00:42:19,00:42:20,I've never heard of that.
00:42:20,00:42:23,- I didn't think he was a Mason.
00:42:23,00:42:24,"- I mean, you can be a Catholic in a Mason."
00:42:24,00:42:25,"- Of course, what a surprise."
00:42:25,00:42:28,"- Yeah, that rings a tiny bell."
00:42:28,00:42:29,I don't remember.
00:42:29,00:42:30,- We did quite extensive research on him
00:42:30,00:42:32,when he came on our radio show.
00:42:32,00:42:33,- Yeah.
00:42:33,00:42:34,"- I didn't, that never came up."
00:42:34,00:42:35,"- Well, it wouldn't do."
00:42:35,00:42:36,"- Oh, did it."
00:42:36,00:42:40,- It feels like the 20th century was big for the Masons.
00:42:40,00:42:41,"- Oh, yeah."
00:42:41,00:42:42,- It's now not quite as big a thing.
00:42:42,00:42:43,"- Yeah, I think on downhill a bit, do you think?"
00:42:43,00:42:45,- I think a little bit.
00:42:45,00:42:46,"- That's a shame, isn't it?"
00:42:46,00:42:51,I think that all the forces are at large now.
00:42:51,00:42:52,- Internet.
00:42:52,00:42:56,"- The Masons of the modern day, the Internets."
00:42:56,00:42:58,"Well, it's just a shame to lose"
00:42:58,00:42:59,those exciting handshakes.
00:42:59,00:43:00,"- Yeah, that's true."
00:43:00,00:43:01,That's true.
00:43:01,00:43:02,I agree with that.
00:43:02,00:43:03,Here's one.
00:43:03,00:43:04,- I don't know them.
00:43:04,00:43:05,How do you know they're exciting?
00:43:05,00:43:06,"- Yeah, you are not allowed in."
00:43:06,00:43:07,What's going on?
00:43:07,00:43:09,- Any handshake is exciting.
00:43:09,00:43:10,"There's not a conventional handshake, right?"
00:43:10,00:43:12,"If you shake someone's hand and anything happens,"
00:43:12,00:43:14,"that's not just them grasping your hand and shaking it,"
00:43:14,00:43:15,you're excited.
00:43:15,00:43:16,- I don't know.
00:43:16,00:43:17,That one with the finger goes and gives you a little tickle.
00:43:17,00:43:18,- You'd be excited.
00:43:18,00:43:20,- I'd rather giggle than tickle in my case.
00:43:20,00:43:23,(laughing)
00:43:23,00:43:26,- Here's a great one from Andre Ryback.
00:43:26,00:43:28,Regarding pink noise and the human ear bracing
00:43:28,00:43:29,for impact of a louder noise.
00:43:29,00:43:32,"- Yes, I mentioned that where cars have a pink noise"
00:43:32,00:43:33,that they release just before impact
00:43:33,00:43:35,so that your eardrums don't shatter.
00:43:35,00:43:35,- Brilliant.
00:43:35,00:43:38,I was very surprised that none of the hosts mentioned
00:43:38,00:43:40,the tense or timpani muscle.
00:43:40,00:43:43,"It's one of the most, no such thing as a fish muscles"
00:43:43,00:43:45,in the human body because a portion of the population
00:43:45,00:43:48,has voluntary control of it.
00:43:48,00:43:50,The other portion who only have the automatic reflex
00:43:50,00:43:52,that was mentioned on fish
00:43:52,00:43:54,can never fully know what it's like.
00:43:54,00:43:57,So this is what Andre says and it turns out I can do this.
00:43:57,00:43:59,Tensing the tense or timpani muscle allows you
00:43:59,00:44:02,"to make a rumbling noise in the ear on demand,"
00:44:02,00:44:03,a noise that only you can hear.
00:44:03,00:44:06,So you just sort of tense your inner ear.
00:44:06,00:44:07,You can hear that rumbling.
00:44:07,00:44:08,"- Oh my God. - Change of nodding,"
00:44:08,00:44:09,you can do that.
00:44:09,00:44:11,"- Hold on, so I tense my inner ear."
00:44:11,00:44:13,- Just make the rumbling noise in your ear.
00:44:13,00:44:16,"- Oh yeah, just did it."
00:44:16,00:44:16,- Yeah.
00:44:16,00:44:19,"- No, I can make a high ringing noise, but not a rumbling."
00:44:19,00:44:20,- You can't join the secret club then.
00:44:20,00:44:22,(laughing)
00:44:22,00:44:24,"Oh, we had such an amazing hand shake plant."
00:44:24,00:44:27,(laughing)
00:44:27,00:44:29,- I love that thing that they said of the most
00:44:29,00:44:32,"no such thing as a fish muscle, they say."
00:44:32,00:44:35,"- Yeah, he said most no such thing as fish"
00:44:35,00:44:36,"class QI muscles, but I edited it down."
00:44:36,00:44:38,"- Oh okay, but still it's quite a cool thing"
00:44:38,00:44:40,that we've built off the back of finding
00:44:40,00:44:43,these interesting facts and that's another book idea.
00:44:43,00:44:45,"You know, the most no such thing as a fish thing."
00:44:45,00:44:47,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:44:47,00:44:48,- I love that.
00:44:48,00:44:50,- Can I give an alternate muscle just while we're
00:44:50,00:44:51,in the ear area?
00:44:51,00:44:54,"And that is recently, you know, like some animals"
00:44:54,00:44:58,"can move their ears and humans can move their ears,"
00:44:58,00:45:00,but really they're just moving the jaw
00:45:00,00:45:03,"and the ears kind of go, but we have the muscles"
00:45:03,00:45:04,that can move your ears in the same way
00:45:04,00:45:07,"that a dog or a cat can move their ears,"
00:45:07,00:45:09,but the muscles are not strong enough.
00:45:09,00:45:12,They did an experiment where they played some sound
00:45:12,00:45:15,in an area and they looked at what like muscles
00:45:15,00:45:17,were tensing and they could see that these muscles
00:45:17,00:45:20,"were moving, but they weren't moving their ears."
00:45:20,00:45:20,- Wow.
00:45:20,00:45:22,"- So yeah, like if you hear a sound,"
00:45:22,00:45:23,if you hear someone you say your name
00:45:23,00:45:26,"behind you to the left, your body is trying"
00:45:26,00:45:27,"to move your ear around towards it,"
00:45:27,00:45:28,but the muscles aren't strong enough.
00:45:28,00:45:31,"- Is there something we could, like if we snipped"
00:45:31,00:45:33,"a bit of the top and bottom of your ear,"
00:45:33,00:45:34,do you think it could swivel?
00:45:34,00:45:37,"- Oh yeah, like a tongue tie, we've got a near tie."
00:45:37,00:45:38,- What if you just spent your life training
00:45:38,00:45:40,and then you spent your life training your children
00:45:40,00:45:42,to try and move their ears
00:45:42,00:45:44,and they spent their life training their children.
00:45:44,00:45:45,How long would it take before we could get this back?
00:45:45,00:45:46,- We will probably have to find--
00:45:46,00:45:50,"- That's not how evolution works, I don't think."
00:45:50,00:45:51,"- Oh, you have to get a flamarcosis."
00:45:51,00:45:52,"- Yes, you are."
00:45:52,00:45:55,"- Has a flamarcosis been overtaken, sorry?"
00:45:55,00:45:57,- What would be better is if some people
00:45:57,00:46:01,genetically modified so that they could move their ears
00:46:01,00:46:03,and then they found each other really sexy.
00:46:03,00:46:05,"- Will they hear more people saying, ""Do you want to have sex?"""
00:46:05,00:46:08,And then they are more fertile as a result.
00:46:08,00:46:09,"- Exactly, yeah."
00:46:09,00:46:10,- That's all you think's been holding you back.
00:46:10,00:46:13,"- I'm on the dance mat, I can't hear a thing."
00:46:13,00:46:23,"- Well, shall we wrap up?"
00:46:23,00:46:24,- Yeah.
