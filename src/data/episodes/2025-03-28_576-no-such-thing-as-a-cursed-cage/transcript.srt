1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:13,440
 - Hello, and welcome to another episode

3
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:14,480
 of No Steps to Thing as a Fish,

4
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:15,680
 a weekly podcast coming to you

5
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:17,420
 from the QI offices in Hoban.

6
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:18,480
 My name is Andrew Hunter Murray.

7
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,580
 I'm here with Dan Schreiber, James Harkin,

8
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:22,460
 and Anna Tijinski, and we have gathered

9
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:26,620
 around the table for a quarterly, I think.

10
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:28,820
 - We aim for that, but we only did three last year.

11
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:29,660
 - There we go.

12
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:30,800
 - A...

13
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,240
 Triennial...

14
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:35,400
 Show, where we go through the fish inbox,

15
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:37,540
 podcast@qi.com, we find the best facts

16
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:40,440
 that you have sent to us, and we read them back to you.

17
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:43,320
 So we've all learned from each other, and it's all square.

18
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:44,880
 The inbox has had lots and lots of brilliant

19
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:45,920
 fact submissions over the last few months.

20
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:46,980
 - It's overflowing, Andy.

21
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:48,020
 - It's bulging.

22
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:49,360
 We've got a bulging post-bag.

23
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:51,660
 - We have physical things to read.

24
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:54,060
 - Yes, so the guys here have not seen

25
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:55,820
 the facts that we've been sent.

26
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:57,620
 I have brought them in, printed them out on bits of paper,

27
00:00:57,620 --> 00:00:59,000
 and chopped the bits of paper up.

28
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,140
 We all have a stack of small slips of paper in front of us,

29
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:02,340
 and we're going to see if this works,

30
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:03,400
 which I think it might.

31
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:06,300
 So let's have a fact, if anyone's got one.

32
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:09,680
 - Okay, I'm going to open with a fact from Leander,

33
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,140
 from Switzerland.

34
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:14,380
 Inkus, the last Carolina parakeet,

35
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:16,780
 died in the same cage as Martha,

36
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:18,820
 the last passenger pigeon.

37
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:20,220
 - Oh, that's interesting.

38
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:21,280
 - No further info.

39
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:22,120
 - Crazy.

40
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:23,120
 - It's, yeah, mad.

41
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:25,320
 - Are we saying that it's a cursed cage?

42
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:26,300
 - Must be.

43
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:27,820
 - It's got to be, unless they just killed each other,

44
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:29,540
 it's one of those fights of the death where they both.

45
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:31,340
 - So wait, what was it, the last passenger pigeon,

46
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:32,180
 and the last, what, sorry?

47
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:33,780
 - The last Carolina parakeet,

48
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:35,980
 which does seem quite specific, but still cool.

49
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:38,140
 - Still, still, it's two of a kind.

50
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:39,340
 - Oh yeah, actually, when I first read it,

51
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:40,840
 I thought that it was Inkus,

52
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:42,500
 the last Carolina parakeet,

53
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:44,700
 and Martha, and now it would have been even more amazing.

54
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:46,180
 - All the Inkus died.

55
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:47,380
 - All the Inkus died.

56
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:49,500
 - This sounds like, I hope Stephen King isn't listening,

57
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:52,280
 'cause that sounds right up his street of a murderous cage.

58
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:54,780
 - The cursed cage, yeah, yeah.

59
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:58,160
 - It could be a sort of like a retirement home of cages,

60
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:00,860
 where it's, you know, it's the last of a species goes there.

61
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:03,340
 - Yeah, it's really, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

62
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:04,180
 - Maybe.

63
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:07,300
 - They see like little pictures on the cage wall

64
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:09,140
 of the previous tenants, you know.

65
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:10,700
 - Is that what they do in all people's homes and stuff?

66
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:12,420
 They have the pictures of the analysis.

67
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:13,620
 - Have you ever watched the traitors?

68
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:14,660
 Whenever anyone leaves,

69
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:16,420
 they put a big red cross through their face.

70
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:17,740
 They do that in all people's homes as well.

71
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:18,580
 - I didn't know that.

72
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:19,400
 - That's how it works.

73
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,740
 - Oh, you know, you gotta face up to the truth, don't you?

74
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:22,740
 - Yeah.

75
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:24,220
 - Gosh.

76
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:25,060
 - Well, that's a great fact.

77
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:27,740
 - It's an excellent fact, very cool.

78
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:28,860
 - Can I do one, honey?

79
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:29,700
 - Yeah.

80
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:32,020
 - This is from Hediver, and it says,

81
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:35,860
 "Dear Anna, you are always my favorite podcast host."

82
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:36,920
 - Yeah, that makes sense.

83
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:39,340
 - I feel like I picked up the wrong pile here.

84
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:40,180
 - That's a good fact.

85
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:41,020
 It's not an interesting fact.

86
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:42,260
 It's a pretty basic fact.

87
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:43,220
 We've had it loads.

88
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:44,940
 - If someone else has taken over the mailbox,

89
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:46,860
 duty please disregard that.

90
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:47,700
 - Yes, thank you.

91
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:50,500
 - Consider it disregarded, Hediver.

92
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:53,900
 I write now to share the most fish fact I have ever learned.

93
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:56,620
 There is one extant species of marsupial,

94
00:02:56,620 --> 00:03:00,540
 the water opossum, in which the males have pouches.

95
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:02,940
 These pouches are not used to host joeys,

96
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:04,860
 but serve the exclusive purpose

97
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:06,940
 of storing the male genitalia

98
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:09,980
 to prevent them from getting tangled in weeds while swimming.

99
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:10,860
 (laughing)

100
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:11,700
 - Wow.

101
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:13,540
 - That's so good.

102
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:14,380
 - That's incredible.

103
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:15,660
 - Tangled in weeds.

104
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:17,140
 - Do you wish you had that?

105
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:19,380
 - I don't go while swimming like you do, Anna.

106
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:21,940
 - No, okay, and I don't get stuff tangled in weeds too.

107
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:23,460
 - I'm always getting tangled in weeds.

108
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:25,220
 (laughing)

109
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:28,180
 - I can't picture the genitals of,

110
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:29,500
 can anyone of this particular animal?

111
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:32,060
 - If it's marsupial, then it will be

112
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:34,380
 quite a big bull sack kangaroos, have a leg.

113
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:37,300
 I have a kangaroo bull sack purse at home.

114
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:38,740
 (laughing)

115
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:39,580
 Two dozen.

116
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:40,900
 (laughing)

117
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:43,580
 - To see James tip in a restaurant is quite a sight.

118
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:44,420
 (laughing)

119
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:47,060
 As he gets out his little pantsnay glasses,

120
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:47,900
 (laughing)

121
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:50,740
 and opens the glass on his kangaroo scrotum.

122
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:51,580
 - Yeah.

123
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:54,580
 - I thought you guys knew that, that I had that.

124
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:56,140
 I bought it when we were on tour the first time

125
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:56,980
 in Australia. - Did you?

126
00:03:56,980 --> 00:03:57,820
 - Yeah.

127
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:59,940
 - That's, yeah, it's ringing a bell now, yeah.

128
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:02,380
 - So what was it? - Is it roomy?

129
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:03,940
 (laughing)

130
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:06,260
 - No, not, well, you could probably keep

131
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:07,820
 a couple of billiard balls in it.

132
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:09,660
 - Oh, okay, that is roomy.

133
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:12,700
 I don't mean to give away too much.

134
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:13,540
 (laughing)

135
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:14,780
 I am impressed.

136
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:18,580
 - But yeah, kangaroos have got quite large scrotum.

137
00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:19,420
 - And what's this called?

138
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:20,260
 There's marsupial.

139
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,460
 - This is a water opossum.

140
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:22,900
 But I think generally speaking,

141
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:26,220
 marsupials have similar reproductive systems, don't they?

142
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:27,060
 - Yeah.

143
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:28,100
 - They all tend to have like,

144
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:29,820
 uteruses with three openings.

145
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:30,660
 - Mm.

146
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:32,100
 - Did that specify where the pouch was?

147
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:33,500
 'Cause I'm picturing a kangaroo pouch,

148
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:34,940
 and that feels like quite a long journey to-

149
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:36,300
 - Probably not far off.

150
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:37,380
 (laughing)

151
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:38,700
 - It's probably not far off, though.

152
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:41,220
 - You can't tuck yours in your top pocket, for instance.

153
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:42,560
 (laughing)

154
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,860
 Have you forgotten one of those little handkerchiefs?

155
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:47,100
 (laughing)

156
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:49,140
 - But the way evolution works is so mad.

157
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:50,940
 'Cause it must have started out as a little skin flap

158
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:51,780
 or something.

159
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:52,620
 - Yeah.

160
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:55,300
 - And presumably fewer male water opossums drowned

161
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:57,380
 because they had this little evolutionary skin flap.

162
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:58,900
 - Well, all had their testicles torn off

163
00:04:58,900 --> 00:04:59,740
 and couldn't reproduce.

164
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:00,580
 - Right, exactly.

165
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:01,860
 But there must have been a way in which like,

166
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:03,620
 have you heard the latest thing in the water opossum world

167
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:06,900
 is this little flap of skin, which protects your knackers?

168
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:08,580
 I just think that's, it's unbelievable.

169
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:10,020
 And then those are the fit ones that survived.

170
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:10,860
 - It's crazy.

171
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:13,160
 And of course, with this entire format,

172
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:15,940
 we are relying on the people who wrote to us

173
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:17,140
 telling us the truth.

174
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:17,980
 - Oh yeah.

175
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:20,620
 I've done no quality control on these whatsoever.

176
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:21,740
 - Do your own research, guys.

177
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:23,940
 We do it every week, you know?

178
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:25,420
 Still haven't taken some responsibility.

179
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:26,580
 - But ahead of that, I believe you.

180
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:27,420
 - Very cool.

181
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:28,260
 - Brilliant.

182
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:29,080
 - Shall I do one?

183
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:29,920
 - Yeah.

184
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:30,900
 - This is from Dr. Kevin W. Jennings,

185
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:34,460
 Department of Social Sciences, Lincoln Memorial University.

186
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:37,340
 Astronaut Steve Hawley's space shuttle launches

187
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:38,740
 kept getting scrubbed.

188
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:41,820
 He had 15 or 16 launches scrubbed in his career.

189
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:43,500
 A record, question mark.

190
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:46,460
 After one scrub, I think scrub means didn't happen.

191
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:47,300
 - Capsled.

192
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:48,140
 - Yeah.

193
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:50,020
 - You know, that's some no scrubs.

194
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:51,180
 It's written by an astronaut

195
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:52,940
 who really wanted to go into space.

196
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:56,940
 - After one scrub prior to his fourth mission,

197
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:58,420
 he remarked that the space shuttle

198
00:05:58,420 --> 00:06:00,220
 obviously knew he was aboard.

199
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:02,340
 So it was refusing to launch.

200
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:03,420
 His crewmates agreed.

201
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:05,460
 So they made him wear a disguise

202
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:07,060
 during the next launch attempt.

203
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:07,900
 - No.

204
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:09,300
 - They're all in spacesuits.

205
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:11,580
 How much better disguise can you get?

206
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:15,860
 - Yeah, so they made him wear a disguise

207
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:17,020
 during the next launch attempt.

208
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:19,220
 So the shuttle wouldn't recognize him.

209
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:20,100
 It worked.

210
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:22,460
 And the shuttle launched on that attempt.

211
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:25,540
 The crew of his fifth mission forced him to do it again.

212
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:26,660
 And it was successful again.

213
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:29,540
 Apparently the space shuttle just didn't like him.

214
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:30,860
 Pictures for a proof.

215
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:32,660
 And then Andy's not included the pictures.

216
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:33,500
 - Oh, no.

217
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:35,540
 - But wow.

218
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:36,500
 - The pictures seem essential.

219
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:39,740
 This disguise, was it a kangaroo disguise?

220
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:42,300
 Was it, what could it have been?

221
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:46,300
 - Testicles were popping out of the book.

222
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:47,700
 It's called Harley this guy.

223
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:48,700
 - Steve Hawley.

224
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:49,540
 - That's amazing.

225
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:50,380
 - Very cool.

226
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:51,540
 - God, and that's the scientists who believed that.

227
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:53,140
 These are the people who were trusting to build rockets.

228
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:55,300
 People who think space shuttles decide against people.

229
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:57,780
 - The astronauts, they'll build the rockets.

230
00:06:57,780 --> 00:06:58,620
 - Oh, do they know?

231
00:06:58,620 --> 00:06:59,820
 I thought you had to do it all the way through.

232
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:01,220
 - Dan, was that from an eminent scientist?

233
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:02,060
 Did you say?

234
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:03,460
 - That was from a doctor.

235
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:04,300
 - Okay.

236
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:05,140
 - It's not eminent, is it?

237
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:05,980
 That'd be professor.

238
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:10,100
 - You get away with nothing in this game.

239
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:11,620
 - I'm a moderately achieving scientist.

240
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:12,460
 - Okay.

241
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:14,020
 Well, this, geez.

242
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:15,580
 Here's an email from Colin McIntyre,

243
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:17,820
 who says, "I'm the educator and resident historian

244
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:20,220
 "of the New England Aquarium in Boston."

245
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:21,060
 - Cool.

246
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:23,020
 - "It entertains me and my colleagues no end

247
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:25,420
 "when our beloved aquarium is mentioned on your podcast,

248
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:28,340
 "e.g. Andre the seal, Animal Bartering,

249
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:31,060
 "but we've never heard you refer to it by its actual name.

250
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:32,100
 "As a friend of the podcast,

251
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:33,560
 "I believe we've earned the right to be called

252
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:34,740
 "the New England Aquarium

253
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:37,500
 "rather than just an aquarium in Boston."

254
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:38,340
 So fair enough.

255
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:39,420
 - Yeah, yeah.

256
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:42,900
 - And he's included some facts and here's one of them.

257
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:46,060
 There is a mummified cod buried in the foundation

258
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:48,260
 of the New England Aquarium,

259
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:50,460
 but that's not the weird thing about it, I think.

260
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:52,620
 What he says is it's called Ichabod.

261
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:56,900
 The fish started the construction of the entire aquarium.

262
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:58,100
 This is mad.

263
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:00,420
 So the fish was the star

264
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:03,680
 of the aquarium's groundbreaking ceremony in 1965,

265
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,300
 when a scuba diver holding him

266
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:07,020
 emerged from nearby Boston Harbor

267
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:08,540
 and dropped him into a tank of water.

268
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:10,980
 So at this point, it's a live fish.

269
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:13,860
 This electronically triggered the construction equipment

270
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:16,380
 on the future site of the aquarium,

271
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:19,820
 thanks to a system designed by Harold Doc Egerton.

272
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:23,260
 So the New England Aquarium was,

273
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:24,980
 the construction was kick-started by a fish

274
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:26,260
 being dropped into a tank of water.

275
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:27,100
 - It was intentional.

276
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:28,740
 - That was what it was always going to be, right?

277
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:29,580
 - Yes.

278
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:30,420
 - They planned.

279
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:32,300
 - This was meant to be a library,

280
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:33,940
 but we were going to drop in a book,

281
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:36,780
 but then we dropped in a fish by mistake.

282
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:38,240
 It's hard to tell if rockets know

283
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,660
 which astronauts are going to go.

284
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:40,500
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

285
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,540
 So they decided to build as a aquarium,

286
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:43,620
 starting with a fish.

287
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:44,460
 - Yeah, yeah.

288
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:46,140
 A scuba diver comes out of the water holding a live fish,

289
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:47,140
 drops it into a tank,

290
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:49,580
 and that electronically senses a fish has been dropped in

291
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:51,420
 and triggers the construction equipment.

292
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:53,180
 That is a very cool opening ceremony.

293
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:55,220
 - You know, like if you watch the Olympics,

294
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:58,540
 they have the word they set off the fire, the flame.

295
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:00,220
 They always do something really exciting,

296
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:02,060
 but actually it's just a guy with a button

297
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:03,500
 who's sat next to it, right?

298
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:04,340
 - Right.

299
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:06,380
 - I feel like I would do it in this situation as well.

300
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:07,220
 I'm sorry to say.

301
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:08,940
 - Do you mean like there was that famous one

302
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:10,580
 where an archer shot the flame

303
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:11,980
 and we all thought it landed?

304
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:14,660
 Yeah, but it was, I see, yes.

305
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:15,500
 - And who was it?

306
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:16,340
 Which president?

307
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:17,180
 There was a president who had to tell

308
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:19,100
 on the Christmas lights once remotely.

309
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:21,020
 And he thought, I think it was in the '50s,

310
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:23,780
 it was maybe it was Lyndon Johnson,

311
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:26,380
 and he thought he was doing it remotely

312
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:28,700
 'cause of this amazing remote light turning on technology.

313
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:29,980
 And actually, I think there was just someone

314
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:31,700
 that lights in the White House who just looked to switch.

315
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:32,820
 - Yeah, right.

316
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:34,620
 - Maybe that's how it's happening all over the world.

317
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:36,740
 - So you're casting doubt on this, James, I think.

318
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:38,340
 - I'm just saying that if I was in charge,

319
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:39,620
 I wouldn't rely on the fish.

320
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:40,660
 - Yeah, that's fair.

321
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:44,340
 When the Queen, the true Queen, sent her first tweet

322
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:46,060
 or whatever, she pressed a button,

323
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:48,540
 and then I think it just like prodded a nearby intern

324
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:50,740
 to a friend and sent tweet.

325
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:52,420
 I seem to remember.

326
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:54,220
 - Wow, a fister of a Jack in a book.

327
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:57,820
 Here's one from Ralph Linsangan.

328
00:09:57,820 --> 00:09:59,020
 He says he's a big fan.

329
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:00,340
 Thanks, Ralph.

330
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:01,380
 And-

331
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:03,060
 - Of yours or of all of us?

332
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:03,900
 - I've got a scene of mine.

333
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:04,940
 - What's your doctorate in?

334
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:05,780
 Ralph?

335
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:10,220
 - America's just 71 miles long,

336
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:12,460
 measured from its easternmost point

337
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:15,300
 to its westernmost point.

338
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:18,620
 And he's talking about that trick fact,

339
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:20,860
 which is the Aleutian Islands,

340
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:22,580
 which cross the 180th Meridian.

341
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:24,540
 So they constitute the easternmost

342
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:25,740
 and the westernmost point,

343
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:27,340
 but the other way around to which you'd think.

344
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:28,180
 - Interesting.

345
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:29,540
 - Because the easternmost point is the furthest

346
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:31,740
 sort of west from where we are.

347
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:33,180
 So there you go.

348
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:34,020
 - That's a great fact.

349
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:34,860
 - Yeah, that's awesome.

350
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:35,700
 - It is.

351
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:36,540
 And I remember, we were actually just talking

352
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:39,180
 about the Aleutian Islands in a podcast we recorded,

353
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:41,140
 which may have gone out by the time this goes out,

354
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:42,700
 or it may not have.

355
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:44,100
 It's about Alaska.

356
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:45,420
 But we were talking about something

357
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:46,260
 that I don't think as well-

358
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:47,420
 - It was last week's show.

359
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:48,380
 - It was last week's show.

360
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:49,220
 There you go.

361
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:50,660
 We were talking about something,

362
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:51,580
 I don't think it's well known enough,

363
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:53,980
 that the only land war fought in America

364
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:56,300
 in the Second World War was in the Aleutian Islands,

365
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:57,140
 with the Japanese just-

366
00:10:57,140 --> 00:10:57,980
 - That was Japan, USA.

367
00:10:57,980 --> 00:10:59,100
 I didn't think any bit of America

368
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:02,260
 had ever been occupied in the Second World War.

369
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:04,380
 - Everyone forgets, Fuehler Islands.

370
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:05,220
 - Yeah.

371
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:08,780
 - That's the bit where humans walked across, isn't it?

372
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:10,340
 You know, there was a land bridge there.

373
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:11,180
 - Oh really?

374
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:12,340
 - From which side?

375
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:14,900
 - Well, Andy nodded, so you get a klaxon,

376
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:16,860
 because it's not true.

377
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:18,100
 And this is recent.

378
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:20,340
 They've kind of looked at what it would have been like

379
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:22,380
 around the time when humans came over,

380
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:24,300
 and that would have been pretty much impossible

381
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:27,180
 to walk over, because it was so muddy

382
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:29,700
 and swampy and stuff like that.

383
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:32,860
 So they must have gone across in either boats,

384
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:37,220
 or you know, like putting huge tennis rackets on your shoes.

385
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:38,540
 - Like Pogo Sticks, isn't it?

386
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:39,900
 - Oh, Pogo Sticks could have done it, yeah,

387
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:41,860
 but there's no way you could have walked across.

388
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:44,140
 It wasn't a bridge in the modern sense of the word.

389
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:45,220
 - Really? - Yeah, right.

390
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:47,900
 So here's the fact that I think could have been for you, Dan,

391
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:51,020
 because they referenced two of your facts from history.

392
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:51,860
 - Okay.

393
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:53,140
 - It's from Vic Olds.

394
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:55,980
 And they say, "I've been meaning to send in this fact

395
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:57,020
 "for a long time and have been,

396
00:11:57,020 --> 00:11:58,660
 "after hearing your recent facts

397
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:01,940
 "about Harry Balls and Willie Hull,

398
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:04,340
 "I believe I have a female name to rival them.

399
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:07,260
 "About time we had some representation on this show, Dan."

400
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:09,220
 - Back away. - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

401
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:12,260
 - "In 1943, a horse called Count Fleet

402
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:15,460
 "achieved the US Triple Crown in horse racing.

403
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:19,380
 "His owner/trainer was called Fanny Hertz.

404
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:22,300
 "And I believe it does sometimes when you ride horses."

405
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:24,220
 (laughing)

406
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:25,780
 - Very strong. - Lovely.

407
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:28,820
 - Very strong, Fanny Hertz. - The famous hymen breaker,

408
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:30,620
 you're always told as a kid.

409
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:31,460
 - Is that right?

410
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:34,140
 - Always told as a girl, don't worry.

411
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:36,620
 Your hymen doesn't always break when you lose your virginity

412
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:38,660
 because you might have been a horse rider.

413
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:39,500
 - Yeah.

414
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:40,340
 - And that probably would have broken it.

415
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:41,700
 Gross for the horses.

416
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:43,100
 (laughing)

417
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:45,060
 - You're not doing it naked, are you?

418
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:46,980
 - Well, it depends which riding school you attend.

419
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:47,820
 - Yeah.

420
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:49,140
 Shall I do my next one?

421
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:51,140
 - Yeah, we probably had enough hymen chat.

422
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:51,980
 (farting)

423
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:53,780
 - I was curious about the name Sherlock

424
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:57,060
 and how common it was in general use in the UK.

425
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:58,500
 Turns out very not.

426
00:12:58,500 --> 00:12:59,860
 - According to...

427
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:01,260
 (laughing)

428
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:02,900
 - Did you write the same old time?

429
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:04,580
 (laughing)

430
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:05,580
 - Very not.

431
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:07,660
 - Did I say very not?

432
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:08,500
 - He said it. - Yeah.

433
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:09,940
 - Who wrote the same old?

434
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:11,140
 - I'll come to that a bit.

435
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:12,620
 Turns out not very.

436
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:14,380
 (laughing)

437
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:15,220
 - Oh.

438
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:16,780
 (laughing)

439
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:21,260
 - According to free BMD, births and marriages and deaths,

440
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:23,780
 there were seven children registered with the name Sherlock

441
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:27,180
 between 1837 and 1887 when Conan Doyle

442
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:29,140
 first published the fictional detective.

443
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:33,420
 Between 1890 and 1920, there were 16 Sherlocks born,

444
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:36,060
 half of whom also had the surname Holmes.

445
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:38,580
 So families called Holmes seemed to like

446
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:40,180
 having a son called Sherlock.

447
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:43,460
 One family in Pontefract had both a Sherlock and a Mycroft.

448
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:44,460
 - Oh.

449
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:48,780
 - The sons of Richard Holmes and Martha, Ney Belch.

450
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:51,700
 So fan worship isn't anything new.

451
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:53,820
 It goes on, but the last Sherlock Holmes

452
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:56,060
 was born in 1942 in Stoke.

453
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:57,820
 I believe he is still alive.

454
00:13:57,820 --> 00:14:01,340
 And if so, would be the last of the gentlemen still standing.

455
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:03,020
 And that's from Guy Holmes.

456
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:04,420
 - Ah, lovely. - Oh, nice.

457
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:05,460
 - That's very cool.

458
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:07,340
 - Yeah, really cool research.

459
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:08,180
 - Right, here's one.

460
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:10,260
 Evan Friedman, American actor, Jerry Hallever,

461
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:12,860
 has appeared as Saddam Hussein in six separate films.

462
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:15,220
 In fact, Saddam Hussein is the only character

463
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:16,860
 he's ever played.

464
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:17,700
 - Right.

465
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:18,700
 - That's very good.

466
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:19,740
 - Typecasting.

467
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:21,820
 - I have a typecasting fact that I was gonna suggest

468
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:23,100
 for a future show.

469
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:24,260
 Well, maybe I'll say it now.

470
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:25,100
 - Yeah.

471
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:27,220
 - So the woman who won Best Spotting Actress

472
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:31,300
 before Gone With The Wind in 1939 was Hattie McDaniel.

473
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:34,100
 And she played the same role

474
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:38,340
 in I think it's about 130 other movies.

475
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:39,180
 - Basically.

476
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:41,820
 - Not the same character, but the same style of character.

477
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:46,260
 'Cause she was typecast as like this sort of matriarchal,

478
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:47,900
 African-American mother.

479
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:48,740
 - Okay.

480
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:52,220
 - And you know that in the Tom and Jerry cartoons,

481
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:55,020
 when there's a lady stud that she's going,

482
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:56,180
 "Tomas, Thomas!"

483
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:57,480
 That's based on her as well.

484
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:58,320
 - Is it really?

485
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,140
 - Yeah, but she won this award.

486
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:03,420
 And actually, I think she couldn't go to a lot of parties

487
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:06,140
 'cause they were still segregated at the time.

488
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:08,660
 But when she won that award, yeah, basically they put her

489
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:10,900
 as exactly the same character in everything.

490
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:13,700
 - What a shame it's not literally the same character,

491
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:17,300
 like combining all these universes of film together.

492
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:19,020
 It's one person.

493
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:19,860
 - That's amazing.

494
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:21,380
 - That's incredible, yeah.

495
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:25,340
 - Japan's crown jewels probably don't exist.

496
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:27,440
 - Oh. - According to Steve McCabe.

497
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,060
 (laughing)

498
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:30,860
 - And he would know.

499
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:35,860
 He says that Japan has three Imperial sacred treasures.

500
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:39,020
 And then he lists those.

501
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:40,780
 And apparently they're handed over

502
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:42,420
 to each new emperor, his coronation,

503
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:43,980
 but they've not been seen by anyone

504
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:47,140
 outside the Imperial household in centuries.

505
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:49,300
 Wikipedia notes that the actual historical status

506
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:51,140
 of these legendary treasures is unknown.

507
00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:53,380
 And they're intentionally kept from public view.

508
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:55,580
 So Japan's telling us they're real.

509
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:57,060
 We're not allowed to see them.

510
00:15:57,060 --> 00:15:59,300
 It's not certain where they're kept.

511
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:01,940
 And the three treasures are a sword, a mirror,

512
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:04,260
 and a jewel with special names.

513
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:05,100
 What do we think?

514
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:07,460
 - I think that's, there must be lots of things

515
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:10,220
 in this country that we don't know where they are.

516
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:11,420
 - Yeah, we've never seen. - That we've never seen.

517
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:12,980
 - Yeah, they must be right.

518
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:13,820
 I don't know what they are.

519
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:15,180
 - Head of MI5.

520
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:16,540
 - Oh yeah, do they exist?

521
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:18,780
 - Oh, you think we have a prop head

522
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:20,300
 and there's a secret actual head?

523
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:23,060
 - Yeah, I didn't think until you said that,

524
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:24,340
 but that's so convincing.

525
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:25,900
 - It is when you say it, yeah.

526
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:27,860
 - What's the point, 'cause crown jewels are something

527
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:29,580
 that's to show off, isn't it?

528
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:31,620
 What's the point in having that if no one's allowed to see it?

529
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:32,820
 - I wonder if in the olden days,

530
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:35,820
 you could leverage against it,

531
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:37,740
 borrow stuff from your barons.

532
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:39,020
 - I bet you could.

533
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:41,220
 - Because I got this really old spoon here.

534
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:45,020
 - Isn't that the last bit of the old crown jewels

535
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:46,420
 that still survives as a spoon?

536
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:48,860
 It's the only one and everything else has been--

537
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:50,500
 - It all got lost in the wash, didn't it?

538
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:52,580
 - There was the wash and then there was the Civil War.

539
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:53,420
 - Not the wash, I'm sorry,

540
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:55,380
 which is better if I not in a washing machine.

541
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:56,220
 (laughing)

542
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:57,060
 - Sorry.

543
00:16:57,060 --> 00:16:59,260
 - We've totally done two high eight.

544
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:00,100
 - Where's the wash again?

545
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:00,940
 Is it Lincolnshire?

546
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:01,780
 - Off the coast of Norfolk, isn't it?

547
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:02,620
 - Oh, it's off the coast.

548
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:03,460
 It does a bit--

549
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:04,300
 - I don't know, maybe it's Anning Street.

550
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:05,660
 - It does a very marshy bit

551
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:09,060
 and King John supposedly lost the crown jewels in the wash.

552
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:10,660
 Do people still look for it then?

553
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:11,500
 - No.

554
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:12,340
 - Why not?

555
00:17:12,340 --> 00:17:13,180
 - I feel like they're not.

556
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:14,540
 - If we know a specific location,

557
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:18,060
 I think it's probably a bit bigger than is easily searchable.

558
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:19,420
 - You're right, there should be detectorists

559
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:20,260
 that are really--

560
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:21,100
 - I actually thought detectorists,

561
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:23,460
 I kind of assumed that was a place where if you went,

562
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:25,460
 then you would see lots of detectorists desperately hoping.

563
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:27,380
 - Maybe all the detectorists are just assuming

564
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:29,140
 that all the other detectorists are going for it

565
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:30,420
 and they're like, oh, that's too obvious,

566
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:31,740
 I'm gonna look in this field and search.

567
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:33,620
 - They're actually poking out of the ground there.

568
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:34,460
 (laughing)

569
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:36,580
 That could not be easy on a phone.

570
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:39,160
 (upbeat music)

571
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:46,140
 - Here's one, this is from Eddie Edwards.

572
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:48,100
 I was, Edward Edwards.

573
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:49,620
 - Fake name, clearly fake, John.

574
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:51,620
 - I was listening to your audience fact special

575
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:54,140
 and you were talking about that prop nuclear bomb

576
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:55,580
 that was too accurate.

577
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:58,500
 Well, the fake money used in rush hour two,

578
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:00,060
 the second rush hour movie.

579
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:01,340
 Thank you, Eddie.

580
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:03,900
 (laughing)

581
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:06,300
 Was so good that a bunch of people working on the movie

582
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:08,420
 spent some on the Vegas strip

583
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:10,940
 and the secret service ended up getting involved.

584
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:12,500
 It led to a bunch of rules being put in place

585
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:14,260
 about prop money going forward.

586
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:17,060
 - I remember this 'cause they are incredibly strict now.

587
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:19,540
 - Yeah, great scene in the film as well.

588
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:21,500
 It's a good film rush hour two.

589
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:22,700
 Absolutely decent movie.

590
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:23,540
 - Absolutely.

591
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:26,860
 - And it ends with this money showering all over the place,

592
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:29,820
 you know, the suitcase full of money explodes or whatever.

593
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:31,380
 And it's this huge, great room they're in

594
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:32,620
 and the money is going absolutely over.

595
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:35,420
 So I'm sure a load of people could have just pocketed some.

596
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:37,660
 - It's a big thing in films that they worry about on set

597
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:38,780
 when they're using a lot of money.

598
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:39,780
 And actually, if you look at the money

599
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:40,700
 that you have to use in films,

600
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:42,580
 it looks absolutely nothing like real money.

601
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:45,300
 It's got to be about 1.5 times the size and have,

602
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:48,980
 you know, 'cause they've even done ones like British money

603
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:50,700
 with kind of a dog instead of the queen on it

604
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:51,900
 or weird stuff like that, I think.

605
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:53,420
 And they've still said that's too similar

606
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:55,220
 that could be passed off as real money.

607
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:56,060
 - Very, very rich.

608
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:57,900
 - Has to be so different.

609
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:59,780
 - Can I cheekily pull off a double now?

610
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:01,700
 I just have two thematically very linked ones.

611
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:02,540
 - Sure, please.

612
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:03,380
 - I thought it might be fun.

613
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:04,980
 So Lake Berg writes,

614
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:05,980
 "I've come across the following.

615
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:07,260
 "Apollonia was a Christian martyr

616
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:10,300
 "who had her teeth pulled out as torture in 249 CE.

617
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:12,860
 "She later became the patron saint of dentistry.

618
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:14,260
 "Unsure how deep-cut this is,

619
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:16,020
 "and you've probably looked into saints plenty before,

620
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:17,860
 "but I find it funny that she got qualifications

621
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:19,460
 "in the technical field of dentistry

622
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:21,780
 "by just having her teeth pulled out."

623
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:23,660
 I think that's fair, that's a good point.

624
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:25,420
 And then, David and Katie write,

625
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:27,460
 "Hi, just writing in with a fact in dedication

626
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:29,700
 "to our friends Scott and Doris, who've just had a baby."

627
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:31,100
 So quite a lot of names flying around,

628
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:33,300
 but congratulations, Scott and Doris.

629
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:35,740
 And hello, David and Katie, who write,

630
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:37,580
 "The phenomenon of babies being born

631
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:41,340
 "with teeth already erupted, brackets natal teeth,

632
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:44,620
 "has an occurrence of around 0.05%.

633
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:47,340
 "In other words, there is approximately one case

634
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:50,500
 "every 2,000 births."

635
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:52,140
 - Last piece, duh.

636
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:54,780
 (all laughing)

637
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:57,060
 - How good is that?

638
00:19:57,060 --> 00:19:58,460
 - NB, yes, it's a bit of a stretch

639
00:19:58,460 --> 00:20:00,460
 because the prevalence varies between studies,

640
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:02,660
 but roughly, roughly,

641
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:05,060
 what every 2,000, that's stunning.

642
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:06,020
 - That's really good stuff.

643
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:06,860
 - Lovely, thank you, David.

644
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:08,180
 - You know what I tried to find the other day,

645
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:11,100
 and I couldn't, is a picture of a baby skull.

646
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:12,900
 You know how babies are born with all their teeth,

647
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:15,340
 and then you get photos of baby skulls,

648
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:18,060
 which do the rounds where you can see all their adult teeth

649
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:20,540
 up in their gums that haven't come down yet.

650
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:23,460
 But actually, I'm not convinced that those pictures are real.

651
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:26,020
 There's only about two of them floating around,

652
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:28,500
 and they don't seem to be very well verified.

653
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:30,180
 You know, there was one science writer who tweeted one.

654
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:32,020
 So I really want to know if anyone's ever seen

655
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:33,860
 an x-ray of a baby's skull.

656
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:36,460
 - Yeah, I have a feeling that's not true, that.

657
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:38,340
 'Cause I wonder if they're smaller at the time,

658
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:40,540
 and then they grow in your head.

659
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:42,420
 - We're not saying you're not born with all your teeth.

660
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:43,980
 - No, I think you definitely are born

661
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:45,900
 with all your teeth, aren't you, and they descend,

662
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:47,340
 but maybe they're tiny.

663
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:48,940
 - They can't, well, they're not full-size, are they?

664
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:50,500
 'Cause you've seen a baby, they're small.

665
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:53,180
 The head would be all teeth if they had 32 adult teeth.

666
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:54,940
 - In the pictures that they show, the head is all teeth.

667
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:56,700
 Like, it's full-size adult teeth,

668
00:20:56,700 --> 00:21:01,140
 up in the baby's cheek, it's scary shit.

669
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:02,500
 And I've believed it for years.

670
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:04,220
 So yeah, please if you've seen an x-ray.

671
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:06,060
 Yeah, I'm interested that James also thinks maybe it's small.

672
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:08,940
 - I think it's not, I think some of those are fake pictures.

673
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:11,860
 I believe, I feel like I've heard that, maybe I have.

674
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:13,140
 - But how do the teeth get in then?

675
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:16,980
 - They sneak in, and the tooth fairy brings them.

676
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:20,420
 - I think when you eat more calcium as a baby,

677
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:22,820
 for the first seven years of your life,

678
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:25,580
 you take in the calcium, and that helps them to grow.

679
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:28,060
 The same way that you don't have kneecaps and stuff like that.

680
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:30,180
 - Right, and then all the milk gives you all the calcium?

681
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:31,180
 - Yeah.

682
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:32,180
 - There we go.

683
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:33,260
 - I think, I can't really.

684
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:34,940
 - Wow, that would be blowing a shit wide open,

685
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:38,100
 'cause I've seen that image of a side profile of a baby's girl.

686
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:38,940
 - Indeed.

687
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:40,580
 - God, that's incredible, it's all tooth.

688
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:41,420
 - Yeah, disgusting.

689
00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:43,220
 - The whole tooth, nothing but the tooth.

690
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:44,700
 - It was when I showed that.

691
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:45,980
 (laughing)

692
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:47,220
 - Jesus.

693
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:49,820
 - So anyway, if you know about that stuff,

694
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:51,260
 'cause we are speculating a little bit here.

695
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:52,820
 - Absolutely, please tell us.

696
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:54,580
 - To podcast.qa.com.

697
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:57,740
 - This is a fact from Andrew Kirkland,

698
00:21:57,740 --> 00:21:59,740
 and Tee just says that his favorite fact this week

699
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:00,900
 is that according to Wikipedia,

700
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:03,620
 the Irish invented whiskey in the 14th century,

701
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:04,980
 and then they didn't invent anything else

702
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:07,820
 for another 300 years, and.

703
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:08,780
 - That's understandable.

704
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:09,620
 - He's got a point.

705
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:12,980
 - Well, exactly, you've reached your peak, haven't you?

706
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:15,780
 And it's true, the Wikipedia page on Irish inventions

707
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:17,940
 does have a 14th century section,

708
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:19,540
 where they have three inventions.

709
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:22,420
 They have the Precursor to Modern Gaelic Football.

710
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:26,180
 They have the Northern Reginians Anthem,

711
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:28,660
 a huge invention, I think we can all agree,

712
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:32,300
 and whiskey, and the next invention is 17th century.

713
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:33,140
 - And what was that?

714
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:33,980
 - Good point you asked.

715
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:37,700
 (all laughing)

716
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:39,100
 - You don't know it's the whiskey that did it,

717
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:42,020
 it might be the Northern Reginians Anthem, it's so catchy.

718
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:44,220
 Everyone was seeing it for the next 300 years.

719
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:46,820
 (all laughing)

720
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:49,540
 - I have a whiskey related one.

721
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:50,380
 - There you are.

722
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:52,140
 - Okay, so this is from Chris Patterson,

723
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:55,780
 and he thinks that he might be the first outside voice

724
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:57,860
 to be ever heard on noses and things of fish.

725
00:22:57,860 --> 00:22:59,620
 - Chris Patterson, the former governor of Hong Kong.

726
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:00,460
 - Sorry, that's Chris.

727
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:01,300
 - Chris Patterson.

728
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:02,140
 - Yeah, okay.

729
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:02,980
 - Carry on.

730
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:04,060
 - Maybe his son.

731
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:04,900
 - Yes.

732
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:08,380
 (all laughing)

733
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:09,540
 - Can you remember?

734
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:10,380
 So this was someone,

735
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:12,620
 we did a live show and this person shouted out.

736
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:13,460
 - Okay.

737
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:14,300
 - We were in Scandinavia somewhere.

738
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:16,380
 Can you remember anyone who shouted out in Scandinavia?

739
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:17,220
 - Where did we go?

740
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:18,780
 We went Gothenburg, and we went Stockholm.

741
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:20,820
 - I think it was in Gothenburg.

742
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:21,660
 - Gothenburg.

743
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:24,180
 - Oh no, in Stockholm, he says it in the email.

744
00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:26,540
 - I can't remember.

745
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:28,260
 - Did they shout out something other than--

746
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:31,220
 - Yeah, so we were discussing cyborgs

747
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:33,300
 and asked in the audience if there were any cyborgs

748
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:36,740
 in the crowd, and he got to shout out I'm a cyborg.

749
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:40,700
 And this is 'cause he had an RFID chip

750
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:41,820
 put into his body.

751
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:43,660
 You know, like you could get a little chip in your body

752
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:46,820
 so you could use it as a credit card or something.

753
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:49,460
 Anyway, he never got to tell us the whole story that time,

754
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:51,020
 but I've got the whole story here.

755
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:53,420
 He went to an event called Chips and Whiskey,

756
00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:56,740
 thinking that it was potato crisps and alcohol

757
00:23:56,740 --> 00:23:57,820
 that he was gonna get.

758
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:01,820
 But in fact, it was someone giving you these implants,

759
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:03,340
 and he said after a few whiskies,

760
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:04,700
 it seemed like a good idea,

761
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:06,700
 and I got the largest needle I have ever seen

762
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:08,540
 injecting a chip into my hand.

763
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:13,380
 I've used this as a gym card and not much more.

764
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:15,300
 - That's so great.

765
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:16,900
 - Do you know what was that guy called?

766
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:18,420
 - Chris Patton's son.

767
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:19,980
 - Of course.

768
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:21,460
 I've always thought those people all got chips

769
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:23,980
 and started to kind of card douchebags, to be honest,

770
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:27,140
 but that is the best excuse for doing it, I've ever heard.

771
00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:28,540
 - I almost got one.

772
00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:30,540
 - Exactly, exactly my point.

773
00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:32,380
 - Moving on.

774
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:33,740
 - Well, I did, years ago,

775
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:36,700
 I did this little taster tape that was filmed,

776
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:39,940
 whereby it was looking into all of this world of cyborgs,

777
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:42,060
 and as part of it, they wanted to put a chip into me,

778
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:43,220
 and then right at the last minute,

779
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:45,780
 they had someone come in with the device,

780
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:49,580
 and the health and safety didn't allow

781
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:51,540
 for the chip itself to go in,

782
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:54,580
 but they still injected me with the thing to put it in.

783
00:24:54,580 --> 00:24:56,420
 It's so painful.

784
00:24:56,420 --> 00:25:00,300
 So I was filmed as the process as if I had the chip in me,

785
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:01,140
 and then I had to--

786
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:02,020
 - What did they put in there?

787
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:03,340
 - Nothing, it was just empty.

788
00:25:03,340 --> 00:25:04,180
 - So they say.

789
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:05,780
 - Yeah, but yeah, they still,

790
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:07,780
 and then I had to sit there and pretend

791
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:10,300
 that I was turning a lamp on with my hand,

792
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:12,660
 and they, like we're talking about with the queen

793
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:14,260
 having someone press the button,

794
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:16,300
 there was someone on the floor, out of shot,

795
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:18,220
 pressing the button of the lamp flickering,

796
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:20,980
 as I was going, "Look at me, I'm a cyborg."

797
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:24,460
 - Wow, TV is full of lies, isn't it?

798
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:26,060
 You and David Attenborough.

799
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:27,940
 I just, I can't believe with you, Dan,

800
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:29,820
 that however many years I know you,

801
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:32,860
 there's always a new anecdote that I've never heard.

802
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:33,980
 - I'll do one now.

803
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:37,220
 Derek Bailey writes,

804
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:39,580
 "I heard the weirdest fact about albatross

805
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:41,340
 "that may be fish worthy.

806
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:43,580
 "They knew from finding remains of birds

807
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:46,740
 "that the main thing that they eat are squid,

808
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:49,060
 "but they've never been observed catching them.

809
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:52,260
 "They can't dive, so they decided to tag some birds

810
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:53,460
 "to see what was going on.

811
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:56,340
 "The signatures of these tags show they swam for a bit

812
00:25:56,340 --> 00:25:58,900
 "and then the line went into crazy squiggles.

813
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:00,980
 "A young scientist showed his professor

814
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:03,420
 "and he said he thought the tags were broken.

815
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:05,060
 "The prof decided they needed to go

816
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:06,260
 "and watch what was happening.

817
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:08,300
 "They went out to see at night to observe.

818
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:10,180
 "They found these huge birds swimming around

819
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:12,260
 "in tight circles, pulling and pushing

820
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:13,860
 "with their large webbed feet.

821
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:16,140
 "They were creating phosphorescence,

822
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:18,580
 "which was drawing the squid to the surface

823
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:20,340
 "and there was their buffet."

824
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:21,700
 - Cool. - Lovely.

825
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:24,380
 - Like monster flames. - Very cool, Derek Bailey.

826
00:26:24,380 --> 00:26:26,060
 - How are they creating phosphorescence

827
00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:27,020
 with their feet, Derek Bailey?

828
00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:30,740
 - Well, you get those little sort of bacteria and stuff

829
00:26:30,740 --> 00:26:32,580
 and algae that live in the water

830
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:34,620
 and when you move your hands and make waves,

831
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:35,660
 they light up. - I see.

832
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:36,660
 - You get them in Mexico.

833
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:37,500
 - Do you remember that more thing?

834
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:40,900
 - The trails of ships can sometimes glow.

835
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:42,300
 - Yes, I know, I know, but I didn't realise

836
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:43,780
 that another animal who didn't have it

837
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:45,500
 could deliberately would swish it up.

838
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:46,860
 - Oh, it's just water churning, isn't it?

839
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:48,380
 - Yeah, isn't it? - Yeah, very cool.

840
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:51,020
 - Actually, 'cause I was walking on a beach in Hobart

841
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:52,380
 in Tasmania a couple of years ago,

842
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:53,980
 I've never seen anything like it.

843
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:56,500
 It was at night time and as you put your foot down

844
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:59,260
 on the sand, it glowed fluorescent blue all around you.

845
00:26:59,260 --> 00:27:01,580
 It was absolutely extraordinary.

846
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:02,860
 - Wow, it's like avatar.

847
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:03,700
 That's very cool.

848
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:04,540
 - Is that what happens in avatar?

849
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:05,820
 - I actually can't remember, Andy.

850
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:07,060
 - Yeah. - There we go.

851
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:09,660
 - It actually reminded me more of those disco pads

852
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:12,180
 where if you step on a glowing bit,

853
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:13,380
 a bit glows and you step on it.

854
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:16,620
 - Those dance machines, I used to love those things.

855
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:18,300
 Oh my God, I used to love them so much.

856
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:19,140
 - Oh, they're good.

857
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:20,100
 I still do the occasional dance.

858
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:21,940
 - Yeah, if I'm passing an arcade.

859
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:24,260
 - God, is that right?

860
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:26,300
 'Cause I find them very exhausting.

861
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:27,380
 - Oh, the tiring, yeah.

862
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:29,540
 - I guess probably you're a bit younger than me, but yeah.

863
00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:30,380
 - Well, no, it's tiring.

864
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:32,620
 - How do you, was it, you both still do dance?

865
00:27:32,620 --> 00:27:34,820
 - No, I haven't done it for years, no.

866
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:37,180
 But like, would you hold onto the bars when you did it

867
00:27:37,180 --> 00:27:38,780
 or were you like hardcore?

868
00:27:38,780 --> 00:27:40,980
 - No, I don't think I do.

869
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:42,800
 - Is that like having the walls up in Berlin?

870
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:44,820
 (all laughing)

871
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:45,660
 - Exactly.

872
00:27:45,660 --> 00:27:48,060
 - When's the last time you did it, Andy?

873
00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:49,700
 - I would say within the last year.

874
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:51,860
 - On your own, walking past an arcade.

875
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:53,260
 - With my wife.

876
00:27:53,260 --> 00:27:54,860
 We went to a video game arcade.

877
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:55,700
 - Okay, that's different.

878
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:58,060
 - Did you do it where you were like on the same team?

879
00:27:58,060 --> 00:27:59,460
 - She didn't participate.

880
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:01,220
 (all laughing)

881
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:02,700
 She didn't want to.

882
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:04,660
 She said, "I'll just watch you, darling."

883
00:28:04,660 --> 00:28:06,260
 - I want you to take on that nine-year-old.

884
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:08,660
 (all laughing)

885
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:09,500
 - Yeah.

886
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:10,340
 - No, it was really fun.

887
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:11,180
 It was really fun.

888
00:28:11,180 --> 00:28:12,020
 It was a video game bar.

889
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:14,180
 A video game sort of bar slash arcade thing.

890
00:28:14,180 --> 00:28:15,540
 I wasn't drinking obviously, but.

891
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:18,660
 - No, your wife ordered three large vodkas at the bar.

892
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:21,220
 - Do you guys remember that great story

893
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:23,620
 about Jim Lovell from Apollo 13?

894
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:27,420
 So obviously the story of Apollo 13 is insane.

895
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:29,500
 They break down in space on the way to the moon.

896
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:30,340
 They need to get back.

897
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:32,260
 But he had a situation back on Earth

898
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:35,300
 when he was a fighter pilot that was equally as dangerous.

899
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:38,140
 He was on his plane over the sea, got lost

900
00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:41,380
 and managed last minute to find his way back

901
00:28:41,380 --> 00:28:42,380
 to the ship to land on

902
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:44,620
 because he followed the trail of phosphorescence

903
00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:46,460
 that was being left in the wake of the ship.

904
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:47,660
 - I thought that was what you were referencing.

905
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:50,380
 Yeah, it was when he was landing on aircraft carrier,

906
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:51,220
 wasn't he?

907
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:52,060
 - Yeah, yeah.

908
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:52,900
 - Yeah.

909
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:53,740
 - Astonishing, very cool.

910
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:55,780
 So where did the dance mat fit into that?

911
00:28:55,780 --> 00:28:56,620
 (all laughing)

912
00:28:56,620 --> 00:28:57,780
 Once he got out.

913
00:28:57,780 --> 00:29:00,780
 (all laughing)

914
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:01,620
 All right, here's one.

915
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:04,180
 Alexis Beckett from British Columbia.

916
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:05,660
 I'm a long time listener.

917
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:06,740
 I've never written him before,

918
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:07,580
 but for some reason,

919
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:10,500
 Andy Demarney we do persuaded me this Saturday afternoon.

920
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:11,340
 Hmm, I think.

921
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:13,100
 I had nothing good to say.

922
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:14,020
 (all laughing)

923
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:15,980
 - Welcome to the podcast recording mate.

924
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:17,140
 (all laughing)

925
00:29:17,140 --> 00:29:18,620
 So I reached for a weird fact.

926
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:20,660
 I remember being told in high school,

927
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:24,020
 in the Yukon, it's illegal to push a moose

928
00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:26,100
 from an airplane in flight.

929
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:27,980
 It's also illegal to watch a moose

930
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:29,980
 be pushed from an airplane in flight.

931
00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:31,980
 I'm not certain whether this is accurate,

932
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:33,660
 but I've always found it entertaining

933
00:29:33,660 --> 00:29:34,740
 and we shouldn't let the truth

934
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:36,460
 get in the way of a good story.

935
00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:37,700
 Thank you, Alexis.

936
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:38,940
 - That feels a bit cheat, right?

937
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:40,220
 - Yeah, I don't know, Andy.

938
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:41,740
 That doesn't sound true.

939
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:44,300
 - It would be hard to prosecute people who've watched it.

940
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:47,460
 Now the prosecution is gonna bring in some witnesses.

941
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:50,040
 (all laughing)

942
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:54,060
 - Yeah, okay.

943
00:29:54,060 --> 00:29:55,220
 No, it's almost certainly nonsense, isn't it?

944
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:56,060
 Thank you Alexis, regardless.

945
00:29:56,060 --> 00:29:57,340
 - Yeah, it doesn't feel like it.

946
00:29:57,340 --> 00:29:58,380
 - Nice try.

947
00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:00,820
 From James Milne, everyone knows he says,

948
00:30:00,820 --> 00:30:02,220
 and I think he's correct,

949
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:05,580
 that Oslo gifts a tree to London for Christmas every year,

950
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:07,900
 which it does, has done since World War II.

951
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:09,020
 But James Milne says,

952
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:11,420
 it's not the only tree gifted to a British city

953
00:30:11,420 --> 00:30:13,020
 from a Norwegian city.

954
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:13,860
 And I didn't know this.

955
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:17,340
 The city of Bergen gifts a tree to Newcastle every year as well.

956
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:19,700
 Also in recognition of World War II.

957
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:24,100
 And it's because Oslo started gifting London this tree,

958
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:26,380
 and other parts of Norway wanted to recognise

959
00:30:26,380 --> 00:30:27,460
 it wasn't just London.

960
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:30,340
 It was the whole of the UK that contributed to World War II.

961
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:32,380
 And so actually there were quite a lot of cities in the UK

962
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:34,060
 that get free trees from Norway.

963
00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:38,620
 There's Grimsbury, Edinburgh, Orkney, Shetland.

964
00:30:38,620 --> 00:30:40,100
 - Grimsby.

965
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:40,940
 - What did I say?

966
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:41,780
 - Grimsbury.

967
00:30:41,780 --> 00:30:42,620
 - Grimsbury.

968
00:30:42,620 --> 00:30:43,460
 - Grimsbury.

969
00:30:43,460 --> 00:30:44,900
 - That's a local cheese limit.

970
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:47,140
 (laughing)

971
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:50,300
 - That is a really good fact.

972
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:51,300
 - Yeah, I can know that.

973
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:53,820
 - It also is, people always complain

974
00:30:53,820 --> 00:30:55,380
 about the Trafalgar Square Tree,

975
00:30:55,380 --> 00:30:58,140
 because it's this particular kind of coniferous tree

976
00:30:58,140 --> 00:30:59,620
 that the Norwegians send over.

977
00:30:59,620 --> 00:31:01,100
 And it doesn't look as glossy

978
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:03,300
 as some of the really thick branched trees.

979
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:04,820
 People say, "Oh, it looks so scraggy."

980
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:05,860
 And you just think, "Learn some history."

981
00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:06,700
 You know, it's the--

982
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:10,100
 - But I also think they put some not very good lights on it.

983
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:11,420
 You know, like when you do your tree,

984
00:31:11,420 --> 00:31:13,420
 you put like baubles in really nice places.

985
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:14,940
 You've got tinsel all the way around.

986
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:16,620
 They just kind of hang it from the top,

987
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:17,820
 these sort of lights coming down.

988
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:19,140
 - They just do some strings down, don't they?

989
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:20,300
 - Yes, I think it looks crap.

990
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:21,300
 - That's probably us, though.

991
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:22,260
 I'm sure we do the lights.

992
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:24,500
 - Oh yeah, I'm not playing in the Norwegians for that.

993
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:26,740
 But I just think they don't help themselves.

994
00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:28,300
 - Yeah, I've always thought that.

995
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:30,020
 You've got to embed the lights.

996
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:31,500
 They're not for draping.

997
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:32,340
 - Yeah.

998
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:33,180
 - It's mad.

999
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:34,300
 - Probably a health and safety thing.

1000
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:36,900
 Just on war thanks things,

1001
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:40,220
 when we were on tour in Australia,

1002
00:31:40,220 --> 00:31:41,580
 not so long ago,

1003
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:43,620
 we went to Melbourne,

1004
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:46,540
 and I had a day of sightseeing before the show,

1005
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:50,260
 and Melbourne has a present that the British provided

1006
00:31:50,260 --> 00:31:53,860
 in thanks for years of support during total war.

1007
00:31:53,860 --> 00:31:56,660
 Britain gave Australia a small model village.

1008
00:31:56,660 --> 00:31:57,500
 - Really?

1009
00:31:57,500 --> 00:31:59,340
 - Yeah, and you can walk around it now.

1010
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:00,180
 - That's fantastic.

1011
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:01,020
 Of what village?

1012
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:01,860
 - Which village, yeah.

1013
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:02,700
 - It's a generic village.

1014
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:04,660
 So there's, you know, the Shakespeare Arms Pub,

1015
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:06,100
 and there's a little post office.

1016
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:07,300
 But honestly, you go there and you think,

1017
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:09,060
 this is not a good thank you present

1018
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:11,460
 after quite a lot of sacrifice.

1019
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:14,460
 - Well, everyone loves a model village.

1020
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:15,300
 - Yeah.

1021
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:16,140
 - Yeah.

1022
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:17,620
 What's an appropriate thank you for you.

1023
00:32:17,620 --> 00:32:19,660
 After six years of support during total war,

1024
00:32:19,660 --> 00:32:21,220
 I'm trying to dance that.

1025
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:24,620
 That's a good point.

1026
00:32:24,620 --> 00:32:26,420
 Maybe Melbourne really wanted a model village.

1027
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:27,260
 But it's very sweet.

1028
00:32:27,260 --> 00:32:28,380
 It's really sweet.

1029
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:29,980
 If you're anywhere near Melbourne,

1030
00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:30,820
 you've got to check it out.

1031
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:32,140
 - That is quite strange.

1032
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:32,980
 What was it?

1033
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:34,460
 Do you remember that thing where there was a gift exchange

1034
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:36,500
 between Gordon Brown and Barack Obama?

1035
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:38,420
 And Barack Obama like?

1036
00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:40,820
 - Gordon Brown gave Barack Obama an incredibly beautiful,

1037
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:43,340
 I think it was a pen holder carved from the wood

1038
00:32:43,340 --> 00:32:46,580
 of an anti-slaving ship after Britain outlawed slavery

1039
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:49,100
 and was cracking down on the illegal slave trade.

1040
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:50,540
 So it's very symbolic.

1041
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:53,660
 And Obama gave Gordon Brown a bag of DVD.

1042
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:55,820
 - A shower too, I think.

1043
00:32:55,820 --> 00:32:57,180
 - Which were in the wrong zone

1044
00:32:57,180 --> 00:32:59,420
 to be played on British DVD players.

1045
00:32:59,420 --> 00:33:00,980
 A golden age of translates.

1046
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:02,500
 Obama's one misstep, I'd say.

1047
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:04,140
 - Yeah, absolutely.

1048
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:06,860
 Just actually, can I say it on war related gifts?

1049
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:11,380
 - Gernica, the battle started by Pablo Picasso.

1050
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:15,540
 - Just so that he had something to paint.

1051
00:33:15,540 --> 00:33:17,020
 - Exactly, you know.

1052
00:33:17,020 --> 00:33:19,820
 You've got to create your material sometimes.

1053
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:22,500
 No, Gernica was a battle in the Spanish Civil War.

1054
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:24,380
 The Spanish right wing side had a lot of help

1055
00:33:24,380 --> 00:33:26,860
 from fellow fascists from Italy and Germany.

1056
00:33:26,860 --> 00:33:29,020
 And the reason the Nazis got involved

1057
00:33:29,020 --> 00:33:33,580
 was because it was a birthday present to Hitler

1058
00:33:33,580 --> 00:33:35,500
 from the head of the Luftwaffe

1059
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:37,340
 who I think was it going?

1060
00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:39,380
 It was going, had a Luftwaffe.

1061
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:40,420
 Yeah, so it was a happy birthday.

1062
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:41,740
 And actually it really fucked up

1063
00:33:41,740 --> 00:33:43,540
 because the weather screwed it up.

1064
00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:45,500
 So it had to be delayed by about five days.

1065
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:46,980
 So if you look at the dates of Hitler's birthday

1066
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:48,540
 and the dates of Gernica,

1067
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:49,500
 they were five days late,

1068
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:50,980
 but apparently Hitler was very understanding about that.

1069
00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:53,460
 - Yeah, I mean, sometimes you can't have your birthday party

1070
00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:54,820
 on the day of your birthday, can you?

1071
00:33:54,820 --> 00:33:56,380
 - Exactly, you've got to wait till the weekend.

1072
00:33:56,380 --> 00:33:57,500
 - It's on a Tuesday.

1073
00:33:57,500 --> 00:34:01,220
 That's a callback to last week's show.

1074
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:04,300
 - The Luftwaffe's involvement in a battle

1075
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:05,700
 was a birthday present.

1076
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:07,020
 - Yeah, because I think Gary knew

1077
00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:08,580
 that Hitler would be really pleased.

1078
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:10,220
 And it was like a surprise.

1079
00:34:10,220 --> 00:34:11,100
 You know, I decided to get it built.

1080
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:12,420
 - Did they arrive in a giant cake?

1081
00:34:12,420 --> 00:34:13,260
 - They came out of a cake.

1082
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:14,100
 - They came out of a cake.

1083
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:16,260
 - Yeah, flew out of a cake, yeah.

1084
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:19,020
 - Here's a fact from Mark Weiberd,

1085
00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:21,380
 after whom the play bus stop is named.

1086
00:34:21,380 --> 00:34:24,460
 That's a bit of a niche one.

1087
00:34:24,460 --> 00:34:25,940
 People of a certain age.

1088
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:27,820
 There was a kid's show called Play Bus

1089
00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:29,180
 and they had the Weiberd stop.

1090
00:34:29,180 --> 00:34:32,060
 Anyway, Mark Weiberd says,

1091
00:34:32,060 --> 00:34:34,980
 "There is a recently completed Australian legal case

1092
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:37,860
 "establishing an important legal principle

1093
00:34:37,860 --> 00:34:40,420
 "that is called Tickle versus Giggle."

1094
00:34:40,420 --> 00:34:42,700
 - Come on.

1095
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:44,580
 - He says, "It is important and serious

1096
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:46,580
 "for reasons of establishing trans rights,

1097
00:34:46,580 --> 00:34:50,140
 "but it is purely the name that makes me smile."

1098
00:34:50,140 --> 00:34:51,140
 - Do we get any more details?

1099
00:34:51,140 --> 00:34:53,300
 Or is it like, details too dry and serious?

1100
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:54,300
 Name, very funny.

1101
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:55,500
 - I don't have any more details.

1102
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:57,100
 It feels like it would be dry and serious.

1103
00:34:57,100 --> 00:34:58,300
 But Tickle versus Giggle.

1104
00:34:58,300 --> 00:34:59,740
 - Tickle versus Giggle, lovely.

1105
00:34:59,740 --> 00:35:02,460
 - I wonder who's the good guy there, Tickle or Giggle?

1106
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:03,300
 - Tickle.

1107
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:05,700
 - Gotta be Giggle, Tickle is a bad guy always, right?

1108
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:07,020
 - Mr. Tickle.

1109
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:08,340
 - Yeah, no one likes being tickled.

1110
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:09,740
 - He's a good guy.

1111
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:11,260
 He's misunderstood.

1112
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:12,500
 - What about John Tickle,

1113
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:16,060
 the ex-big brother housemate who then went on

1114
00:35:16,060 --> 00:35:18,500
 to do gadget shows?

1115
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:19,340
 - Yes.

1116
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:20,780
 - There's quite a lot of amazing niche references

1117
00:35:20,780 --> 00:35:21,620
 coming in one.

1118
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:25,420
 - I reckon AI could just listen to me

1119
00:35:25,420 --> 00:35:27,260
 in the last 10 minutes and work out exactly

1120
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:30,860
 when I was born, but John Tickle.

1121
00:35:30,860 --> 00:35:32,860
 - John Tickle, I always remember what I liked.

1122
00:35:32,860 --> 00:35:35,740
 I think this was his first so-called invention

1123
00:35:35,740 --> 00:35:37,620
 after big brother was the toaster.

1124
00:35:37,620 --> 00:35:39,460
 Do you remember the toaster that delays

1125
00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:40,300
 the second bit of toast?

1126
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:42,100
 So you put it down, but it doesn't start cooking

1127
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:44,100
 the second bit of toast until your first one's ready.

1128
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:45,340
 Very sensible.

1129
00:35:45,340 --> 00:35:46,460
 I don't know, 'cause you're always gonna deal

1130
00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:48,340
 with the second cold bit of toast.

1131
00:35:48,340 --> 00:35:49,180
 - Yes.

1132
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:50,020
 - Where is he now?

1133
00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:50,860
 - Where is he?

1134
00:35:50,860 --> 00:35:51,700
 - John Tickle.

1135
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:53,300
 - Well, you can retire after that toast moment, can't you?

1136
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:54,140
 - Really?

1137
00:35:54,140 --> 00:35:55,700
 - 'Cause we've all got one now.

1138
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:57,700
 We've really shaken off any international listeners,

1139
00:35:57,700 --> 00:35:58,540
 I think.

1140
00:35:58,540 --> 00:36:07,540
 - I've got one here from Nina de Villiers.

1141
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:09,660
 Long time listener of the podcast.

1142
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:11,740
 I used to work on seahorses.

1143
00:36:11,740 --> 00:36:14,300
 - On seahorses.

1144
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:17,100
 - Very, very small wet grad national.

1145
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:18,500
 - That's how I broke my hymen.

1146
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:25,580
 - In South Africa, actually, I should say,

1147
00:36:25,580 --> 00:36:26,580
 how would you pronounce that?

1148
00:36:26,580 --> 00:36:27,620
 - Ooh.

1149
00:36:27,620 --> 00:36:28,460
 - South Africa.

1150
00:36:28,460 --> 00:36:35,380
 - I wouldn't, I'd guess canizna, I think.

1151
00:36:35,380 --> 00:36:36,220
 - Okay, canizna.

1152
00:36:36,220 --> 00:36:37,980
 So I used to work on seahorses and canizna,

1153
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:39,500
 and a while back, I learned from a colleague

1154
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:41,860
 that seahorses make vocalizations.

1155
00:36:41,860 --> 00:36:45,100
 They make clicking noises during courtship and feeding,

1156
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:47,420
 but they also growl to startle predators.

1157
00:36:47,420 --> 00:36:49,700
 This is followed by quivering their bodies.

1158
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:51,940
 At one point, there was research investigating seahorses

1159
00:36:51,940 --> 00:36:54,440
 to determine where the sound were produced.

1160
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:56,860
 I briefly got involved by taking a dried seahorse

1161
00:36:56,860 --> 00:36:58,780
 to be scanned at our local hospital

1162
00:36:58,780 --> 00:37:00,740
 in the X-ray and CT machine.

1163
00:37:00,740 --> 00:37:02,660
 Other than a very cool looking scan,

1164
00:37:02,660 --> 00:37:04,900
 where you could see all of its baby teeth.

1165
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:07,220
 (all laughing)

1166
00:37:07,220 --> 00:37:09,800
 I'm not actually sure it helped the researcher.

1167
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:12,020
 But she took it, yeah.

1168
00:37:12,020 --> 00:37:14,140
 - But it did help the hospital waiting list,

1169
00:37:14,140 --> 00:37:16,020
 the queue of ambulances outside,

1170
00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:18,820
 waiting for you to scan your seahorse.

1171
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:21,320
 - This is a very recondite one, I love it.

1172
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:24,380
 It's from Isabelle Starling, in relation to Mark Weibert.

1173
00:37:24,380 --> 00:37:28,740
 Something fun I heard the other day.

1174
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:31,340
 William Jones, the man generally credited

1175
00:37:31,340 --> 00:37:33,820
 with the use of the Greek letter pi

1176
00:37:33,820 --> 00:37:37,900
 for the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter,

1177
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:41,820
 was the father of William Jones, another William Jones,

1178
00:37:41,820 --> 00:37:43,860
 one of the first to suggest the existence

1179
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:48,860
 of the Proto-Indo-European language known as pi.

1180
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:51,120
 - Oh, very good. - In no way!

1181
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:52,480
 - How good is that?

1182
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:54,760
 - Hang on, is that a coincidence?

1183
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:56,200
 What, is it one of the names after the other?

1184
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:57,840
 - No, it looks like a--

1185
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:59,200
 - 'Cause why do we call pi pi?

1186
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:00,120
 - Because after the letter.

1187
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:02,160
 - Just the letter, that's just how far we've got.

1188
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:05,080
 'Cause you don't hear all the alpha to--

1189
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:07,760
 - No, there is a reason, there is a reason.

1190
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:08,760
 I can't remember what it is.

1191
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:10,080
 - Yeah. - Wow, that's amazing.

1192
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:12,200
 - I think that's a cracking fact, thank you, Isabelle.

1193
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:13,360
 She finishes her email.

1194
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:15,240
 I also discovered that Shirley Ballas'

1195
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:17,800
 ex-father-in-law invented the strimmer.

1196
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:20,060
 Although I suspect that one is only interesting to me.

1197
00:38:20,060 --> 00:38:21,660
 - Yeah, I like it.

1198
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:23,500
 - Yeah, and for international listeners,

1199
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:25,300
 Shirley, I can't explain Shirley Ballas.

1200
00:38:25,300 --> 00:38:29,060
 - There's no one left, there is no international listener left.

1201
00:38:29,060 --> 00:38:30,860
 - I don't know who that is, so please.

1202
00:38:30,860 --> 00:38:31,700
 - She's on strictly.

1203
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:32,900
 - Former dancer.

1204
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:35,780
 - Got it, asking if Shirley Bassie, got it.

1205
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:36,620
 All right.

1206
00:38:36,620 --> 00:38:39,420
 This is from a guy called Matt Lowry.

1207
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:42,540
 A new pre-print by some folks at the University of Pennsylvania

1208
00:38:42,540 --> 00:38:44,220
 claims we can use resus macaques

1209
00:38:44,220 --> 00:38:46,260
 to predict the winner of elections.

1210
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:48,440
 And it's a pretty interesting discussion

1211
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:51,960
 about behavioral neuro-economics, is it now?

1212
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:54,520
 But it's basically judging on how long

1213
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:56,400
 they look at each candidate.

1214
00:38:56,400 --> 00:39:01,960
 He also says that the area of behavioral neuro-economics

1215
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:04,760
 is a field in a bit of crisis at the moment.

1216
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:06,920
 So I think actually, 'cause he works in that field,

1217
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:08,720
 he's just angling for some funding.

1218
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:11,240
 But there you go, how long a resus macaque

1219
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:12,800
 looks at a candidate?

1220
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:14,200
 I guess it must mean they're more likely to win,

1221
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:15,280
 although he doesn't specify.

1222
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:19,380
 - So do you reckon if you want to be president,

1223
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:21,940
 if you sell a table load of bananas to your face,

1224
00:39:21,940 --> 00:39:23,160
 (all laughing)

1225
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:24,380
 that gives you more of a chance?

1226
00:39:24,380 --> 00:39:25,220
 - That'll do it.

1227
00:39:25,220 --> 00:39:26,540
 (all laughing)

1228
00:39:26,540 --> 00:39:28,900
 - I can think of a conch, he's all right with mine, yeah.

1229
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:31,640
 - We've seen worse candidates, that's all I'm saying.

1230
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:33,940
 - Meanwhile, the Swedish minister of equality's going,

1231
00:39:33,940 --> 00:39:34,780
 "No!"

1232
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:37,220
 (all laughing)

1233
00:39:37,220 --> 00:39:39,420
 - Two week call, like, lovely.

1234
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:41,900
 (all laughing)

1235
00:39:41,900 --> 00:39:43,300
 - He, oh well, here we go.

1236
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:46,160
 He says, so the paper's filled with a number of amusing quotes,

1237
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:47,880
 such as, "Here we show that resus macaques

1238
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:50,280
 "who have no knowledge about political candidates,

1239
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:53,760
 "all their policies implicitly predict the outcome."

1240
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:55,680
 Why would they predict the outcome?

1241
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:56,520
 - So is it different though,

1242
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:58,640
 when they do understand their policies?

1243
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:00,160
 - If they've read the manifesto,

1244
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:03,440
 then yeah, it does change their responses.

1245
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:05,380
 "Implicitly predict the outcomes of U.S.

1246
00:40:05,380 --> 00:40:07,320
 "a gubernatorial and senatorial elections

1247
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:09,280
 "based solely on visual features,

1248
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:12,320
 "and our findings have implications for political campaigns,

1249
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:14,740
 "which should strategically use photos emphasizing

1250
00:40:14,740 --> 00:40:18,220
 "or de-emphasizing jaw width and cheekbone width."

1251
00:40:18,220 --> 00:40:19,060
 I don't know which they prefer,

1252
00:40:19,060 --> 00:40:20,000
 he doesn't say which they prefer.

1253
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,660
 - Oh, wide or narrow, draw bones.

1254
00:40:21,660 --> 00:40:24,520
 Oh, probably wide, nice wide cheekbones, you know.

1255
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:27,960
 - Wide jaw, gotta be, yeah.

1256
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:30,840
 Well done macaques, let's just get them to vote.

1257
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:33,060
 - Isabella Remet writes,

1258
00:40:33,060 --> 00:40:35,660
 "At the Gothenburg Universium,

1259
00:40:35,660 --> 00:40:38,100
 "we support mantle of universe and museum,

1260
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:40,340
 "and which I went to when we were in Gothenburg,

1261
00:40:40,340 --> 00:40:42,440
 "text messages are sent to the sharks

1262
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:43,840
 "so they don't get scared

1263
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:46,900
 "when the nearby train tunnel under construction

1264
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:49,140
 "blasts in the rock."

1265
00:40:49,140 --> 00:40:49,980
 - Aw.

1266
00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:51,480
 - So they've got a warning text,

1267
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:52,820
 like when someone comes around the cafe saying,

1268
00:40:52,820 --> 00:40:55,400
 "We're doing a fire alarm, it's just an alarm."

1269
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:57,820
 - Like when the government sends you a message saying,

1270
00:40:57,820 --> 00:40:59,360
 "This is a test alert."

1271
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:03,960
 Honestly, it's fine, there's no nuclear weapons on the way.

1272
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:05,120
 It's just a test.

1273
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:06,680
 - I mean, we've obviously got no more to go on here,

1274
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:09,240
 but I wonder what the text says.

1275
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:11,460
 (all laughing)

1276
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:14,020
 Probably in Swedish, who says da-da.

1277
00:41:14,020 --> 00:41:16,380
 (all laughing)

1278
00:41:16,380 --> 00:41:18,500
 And also would you not get, if I was a shark,

1279
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:20,300
 I would think a text message would scare me quite a bit.

1280
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:21,620
 - That would be very scary, yeah, yeah.

1281
00:41:21,620 --> 00:41:23,980
 - I just don't work on the water phones, do they?

1282
00:41:23,980 --> 00:41:25,780
 - You get these really cool packets

1283
00:41:25,780 --> 00:41:28,340
 so you can put them in now with a pouch.

1284
00:41:28,340 --> 00:41:29,180
 - Yeah.

1285
00:41:29,180 --> 00:41:30,860
 - I mean, I keep my genitals in mind,

1286
00:41:30,860 --> 00:41:32,860
 but that's for a time as well.

1287
00:41:32,860 --> 00:41:36,020
 (all laughing)

1288
00:41:36,020 --> 00:41:36,860
 - Whose turn is it?

1289
00:41:36,860 --> 00:41:37,700
 - Oh, it's my turn.

1290
00:41:37,700 --> 00:41:39,740
 So thank you, that was a good one.

1291
00:41:39,740 --> 00:41:41,740
 - Antonio Mantica says,

1292
00:41:41,740 --> 00:41:44,460
 "Just finished listening to episode 559

1293
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:46,340
 where you mentioned that the Catholic diocese

1294
00:41:46,340 --> 00:41:48,740
 of Orlando claims jurisdiction over the moon

1295
00:41:48,740 --> 00:41:51,440
 since that's where Apollo 11 launched from.

1296
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:53,340
 I'm surprised nobody, brackets Dan,

1297
00:41:53,340 --> 00:41:55,540
 didn't mention that Buzz Aldrin,

1298
00:41:55,540 --> 00:41:58,820
 a Texas freemason established a Masonic lodge

1299
00:41:58,820 --> 00:42:00,980
 on the moon called Tranquility Lodge,

1300
00:42:00,980 --> 00:42:04,300
 a number 2000 under the Grand Lodge of Texas

1301
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:07,260
 who now claim Masonic jurisdiction to the moon.

1302
00:42:07,260 --> 00:42:08,580
 According to their official website,

1303
00:42:08,580 --> 00:42:11,340
 meetings are held quarterly in various cities around Texas

1304
00:42:11,340 --> 00:42:13,300
 until such time as the lodge may hold

1305
00:42:13,300 --> 00:42:14,980
 its meetings on the moon itself.

1306
00:42:14,980 --> 00:42:18,220
 Can I just say, I did randomly select these things

1307
00:42:18,220 --> 00:42:19,300
 out of the pile.

1308
00:42:19,300 --> 00:42:20,540
 I've never heard of that.

1309
00:42:20,540 --> 00:42:23,100
 - I didn't think he was a Mason.

1310
00:42:23,100 --> 00:42:24,420
 - I mean, you can be a Catholic in a Mason.

1311
00:42:24,420 --> 00:42:25,860
 - Of course, what a surprise.

1312
00:42:25,860 --> 00:42:28,220
 - Yeah, that rings a tiny bell.

1313
00:42:28,220 --> 00:42:29,060
 I don't remember.

1314
00:42:29,060 --> 00:42:30,940
 - We did quite extensive research on him

1315
00:42:30,940 --> 00:42:32,420
 when he came on our radio show.

1316
00:42:32,420 --> 00:42:33,260
 - Yeah.

1317
00:42:33,260 --> 00:42:34,740
 - I didn't, that never came up.

1318
00:42:34,740 --> 00:42:35,900
 - Well, it wouldn't do.

1319
00:42:35,900 --> 00:42:36,740
 - Oh, did it.

1320
00:42:36,740 --> 00:42:40,380
 - It feels like the 20th century was big for the Masons.

1321
00:42:40,380 --> 00:42:41,220
 - Oh, yeah.

1322
00:42:41,220 --> 00:42:42,580
 - It's now not quite as big a thing.

1323
00:42:42,580 --> 00:42:43,740
 - Yeah, I think on downhill a bit, do you think?

1324
00:42:43,740 --> 00:42:45,100
 - I think a little bit.

1325
00:42:45,100 --> 00:42:46,540
 - That's a shame, isn't it?

1326
00:42:46,540 --> 00:42:51,780
 I think that all the forces are at large now.

1327
00:42:51,780 --> 00:42:52,620
 - Internet.

1328
00:42:52,620 --> 00:42:56,500
 - The Masons of the modern day, the Internets.

1329
00:42:56,500 --> 00:42:58,300
 Well, it's just a shame to lose

1330
00:42:58,300 --> 00:42:59,980
 those exciting handshakes.

1331
00:42:59,980 --> 00:43:00,820
 - Yeah, that's true.

1332
00:43:00,820 --> 00:43:01,660
 That's true.

1333
00:43:01,660 --> 00:43:02,500
 I agree with that.

1334
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:03,340
 Here's one.

1335
00:43:03,340 --> 00:43:04,180
 - I don't know them.

1336
00:43:04,180 --> 00:43:05,140
 How do you know they're exciting?

1337
00:43:05,140 --> 00:43:06,860
 - Yeah, you are not allowed in.

1338
00:43:06,860 --> 00:43:07,700
 What's going on?

1339
00:43:07,700 --> 00:43:09,020
 - Any handshake is exciting.

1340
00:43:09,020 --> 00:43:10,300
 There's not a conventional handshake, right?

1341
00:43:10,300 --> 00:43:12,300
 If you shake someone's hand and anything happens,

1342
00:43:12,300 --> 00:43:14,540
 that's not just them grasping your hand and shaking it,

1343
00:43:14,540 --> 00:43:15,380
 you're excited.

1344
00:43:15,380 --> 00:43:16,220
 - I don't know.

1345
00:43:16,220 --> 00:43:17,580
 That one with the finger goes and gives you a little tickle.

1346
00:43:17,580 --> 00:43:18,740
 - You'd be excited.

1347
00:43:18,740 --> 00:43:20,420
 - I'd rather giggle than tickle in my case.

1348
00:43:20,420 --> 00:43:23,060
 (laughing)

1349
00:43:23,060 --> 00:43:26,020
 - Here's a great one from Andre Ryback.

1350
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:28,540
 Regarding pink noise and the human ear bracing

1351
00:43:28,540 --> 00:43:29,820
 for impact of a louder noise.

1352
00:43:29,820 --> 00:43:32,380
 - Yes, I mentioned that where cars have a pink noise

1353
00:43:32,380 --> 00:43:33,700
 that they release just before impact

1354
00:43:33,700 --> 00:43:35,100
 so that your eardrums don't shatter.

1355
00:43:35,100 --> 00:43:35,920
 - Brilliant.

1356
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:38,180
 I was very surprised that none of the hosts mentioned

1357
00:43:38,180 --> 00:43:40,460
 the tense or timpani muscle.

1358
00:43:40,460 --> 00:43:43,100
 It's one of the most, no such thing as a fish muscles

1359
00:43:43,100 --> 00:43:45,900
 in the human body because a portion of the population

1360
00:43:45,900 --> 00:43:48,220
 has voluntary control of it.

1361
00:43:48,220 --> 00:43:50,740
 The other portion who only have the automatic reflex

1362
00:43:50,740 --> 00:43:52,420
 that was mentioned on fish

1363
00:43:52,420 --> 00:43:54,340
 can never fully know what it's like.

1364
00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:57,860
 So this is what Andre says and it turns out I can do this.

1365
00:43:57,860 --> 00:43:59,900
 Tensing the tense or timpani muscle allows you

1366
00:43:59,900 --> 00:44:02,420
 to make a rumbling noise in the ear on demand,

1367
00:44:02,420 --> 00:44:03,540
 a noise that only you can hear.

1368
00:44:03,540 --> 00:44:06,220
 So you just sort of tense your inner ear.

1369
00:44:06,220 --> 00:44:07,460
 You can hear that rumbling.

1370
00:44:07,460 --> 00:44:08,300
 - Oh my God. - Change of nodding,

1371
00:44:08,300 --> 00:44:09,140
 you can do that.

1372
00:44:09,140 --> 00:44:11,300
 - Hold on, so I tense my inner ear.

1373
00:44:11,300 --> 00:44:13,900
 - Just make the rumbling noise in your ear.

1374
00:44:13,900 --> 00:44:16,140
 - Oh yeah, just did it.

1375
00:44:16,140 --> 00:44:16,980
 - Yeah.

1376
00:44:16,980 --> 00:44:19,180
 - No, I can make a high ringing noise, but not a rumbling.

1377
00:44:19,180 --> 00:44:20,780
 - You can't join the secret club then.

1378
00:44:20,780 --> 00:44:22,260
 (laughing)

1379
00:44:22,260 --> 00:44:24,620
 Oh, we had such an amazing hand shake plant.

1380
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:27,140
 (laughing)

1381
00:44:27,140 --> 00:44:29,820
 - I love that thing that they said of the most

1382
00:44:29,820 --> 00:44:32,900
 no such thing as a fish muscle, they say.

1383
00:44:32,900 --> 00:44:35,140
 - Yeah, he said most no such thing as fish

1384
00:44:35,140 --> 00:44:36,980
 class QI muscles, but I edited it down.

1385
00:44:36,980 --> 00:44:38,820
 - Oh okay, but still it's quite a cool thing

1386
00:44:38,820 --> 00:44:40,820
 that we've built off the back of finding

1387
00:44:40,820 --> 00:44:43,140
 these interesting facts and that's another book idea.

1388
00:44:43,140 --> 00:44:45,820
 You know, the most no such thing as a fish thing.

1389
00:44:45,820 --> 00:44:47,220
 - Yeah, yeah.

1390
00:44:47,220 --> 00:44:48,060
 - I love that.

1391
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:50,020
 - Can I give an alternate muscle just while we're

1392
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:51,860
 in the ear area?

1393
00:44:51,860 --> 00:44:54,580
 And that is recently, you know, like some animals

1394
00:44:54,580 --> 00:44:58,500
 can move their ears and humans can move their ears,

1395
00:44:58,500 --> 00:45:00,060
 but really they're just moving the jaw

1396
00:45:00,060 --> 00:45:03,180
 and the ears kind of go, but we have the muscles

1397
00:45:03,180 --> 00:45:04,940
 that can move your ears in the same way

1398
00:45:04,940 --> 00:45:07,540
 that a dog or a cat can move their ears,

1399
00:45:07,540 --> 00:45:09,300
 but the muscles are not strong enough.

1400
00:45:09,300 --> 00:45:12,060
 They did an experiment where they played some sound

1401
00:45:12,060 --> 00:45:15,820
 in an area and they looked at what like muscles

1402
00:45:15,820 --> 00:45:17,820
 were tensing and they could see that these muscles

1403
00:45:17,820 --> 00:45:20,140
 were moving, but they weren't moving their ears.

1404
00:45:20,140 --> 00:45:20,980
 - Wow.

1405
00:45:20,980 --> 00:45:22,180
 - So yeah, like if you hear a sound,

1406
00:45:22,180 --> 00:45:23,500
 if you hear someone you say your name

1407
00:45:23,500 --> 00:45:26,140
 behind you to the left, your body is trying

1408
00:45:26,140 --> 00:45:27,620
 to move your ear around towards it,

1409
00:45:27,620 --> 00:45:28,460
 but the muscles aren't strong enough.

1410
00:45:28,460 --> 00:45:31,300
 - Is there something we could, like if we snipped

1411
00:45:31,300 --> 00:45:33,460
 a bit of the top and bottom of your ear,

1412
00:45:33,460 --> 00:45:34,620
 do you think it could swivel?

1413
00:45:34,620 --> 00:45:37,260
 - Oh yeah, like a tongue tie, we've got a near tie.

1414
00:45:37,260 --> 00:45:38,860
 - What if you just spent your life training

1415
00:45:38,860 --> 00:45:40,620
 and then you spent your life training your children

1416
00:45:40,620 --> 00:45:42,420
 to try and move their ears

1417
00:45:42,420 --> 00:45:44,420
 and they spent their life training their children.

1418
00:45:44,420 --> 00:45:45,860
 How long would it take before we could get this back?

1419
00:45:45,860 --> 00:45:46,980
 - We will probably have to find--

1420
00:45:46,980 --> 00:45:50,060
 - That's not how evolution works, I don't think.

1421
00:45:50,060 --> 00:45:51,380
 - Oh, you have to get a flamarcosis.

1422
00:45:51,380 --> 00:45:52,300
 - Yes, you are.

1423
00:45:52,300 --> 00:45:55,260
 - Has a flamarcosis been overtaken, sorry?

1424
00:45:55,260 --> 00:45:57,860
 - What would be better is if some people

1425
00:45:57,860 --> 00:46:01,220
 genetically modified so that they could move their ears

1426
00:46:01,220 --> 00:46:03,980
 and then they found each other really sexy.

1427
00:46:03,980 --> 00:46:05,780
 - Will they hear more people saying, "Do you want to have sex?"

1428
00:46:05,780 --> 00:46:08,300
 And then they are more fertile as a result.

1429
00:46:08,300 --> 00:46:09,140
 - Exactly, yeah.

1430
00:46:09,140 --> 00:46:10,660
 - That's all you think's been holding you back.

1431
00:46:10,660 --> 00:46:13,260
 - I'm on the dance mat, I can't hear a thing.

1432
00:46:13,260 --> 00:46:23,300
 - Well, shall we wrap up?

1433
00:46:23,300 --> 00:46:24,140
 - Yeah.

1434
00:46:24,140 --> 00:46:27,740
 - Thank you so much to everyone for sending in your effects

1435
00:46:27,740 --> 00:46:30,500
 and for listening and please keep sending them in.

1436
00:46:30,500 --> 00:46:32,340
 We are podcast@qi.com.

1437
00:46:32,340 --> 00:46:34,660
 We love getting facts, we get a load of great ones.

1438
00:46:34,660 --> 00:46:36,020
 These are the absolute creme de la creme.

1439
00:46:36,020 --> 00:46:37,460
 This is the standard, really.

1440
00:46:37,460 --> 00:46:39,220
 You should be matching.

1441
00:46:39,220 --> 00:46:40,540
 - Variable.

1442
00:46:40,540 --> 00:46:42,180
 (all laughing)

1443
00:46:42,180 --> 00:46:45,140
 - Just like us, it's the nicest tribute anyone could pay.

1444
00:46:45,140 --> 00:46:47,580
 So thank you again, we will be back in a week

1445
00:46:47,580 --> 00:46:52,580
 with a regular broadcast between now and then,

1446
00:46:52,580 --> 00:46:56,820
 I guess it's just time to sing the song.

1447
00:46:56,820 --> 00:46:59,580
 - As we always do, Andy, we'll get out of here.

1448
00:46:59,580 --> 00:47:02,220
 - Yeah, just go to, just, I mean, just, you know.

1449
00:47:02,220 --> 00:47:04,460
 - Darn, you want to wrap us up?

1450
00:47:04,460 --> 00:47:05,740
 (all laughing)

1451
00:47:05,740 --> 00:47:07,580
 - Okay, that's it, that's all of your facts.

1452
00:47:07,580 --> 00:47:09,020
 Thank you very much for listening.

1453
00:47:09,020 --> 00:47:11,300
 If you'd like to get in contact, Andy, take over.

1454
00:47:11,300 --> 00:47:13,700
 - You can get in touch with us on the internet.

1455
00:47:13,700 --> 00:47:14,980
 I'm on--

1456
00:47:14,980 --> 00:47:15,800
 - I'm back in.

1457
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:17,980
 You can get us on our various social media accounts.

1458
00:47:17,980 --> 00:47:20,780
 I'm on Instagram, on @shrivaland, James.

1459
00:47:20,780 --> 00:47:23,660
 - My Instagram is the nicest thing is James Hacken.

1460
00:47:23,660 --> 00:47:26,220
 - Andy, I'm on Blue Sky, @andrewhunterm.

1461
00:47:26,220 --> 00:47:27,220
 - Yeah, and @andrewhunterm,

1462
00:47:27,220 --> 00:47:28,460
 where can they get to us as a group?

1463
00:47:28,460 --> 00:47:30,420
 - Instagram are no such thing as a fish.

1464
00:47:30,420 --> 00:47:32,060
 Twitter are no such thing.

1465
00:47:32,060 --> 00:47:34,060
 Or email podcast.qi.com.

1466
00:47:34,060 --> 00:47:34,900
 - We can do it.

1467
00:47:34,900 --> 00:47:35,720
 - We also have a website, don't we, Andy?

1468
00:47:35,720 --> 00:47:40,560
 - Yes, it's no such thing as a fish.com, is it?

1469
00:47:40,560 --> 00:47:41,400
 - Yeah, it is.

1470
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:42,240
 - Okay, yeah.

1471
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:44,020
 - And if you go to those such things as a fish.com,

1472
00:47:44,020 --> 00:47:45,220
 there's all sorts of stuff there.

1473
00:47:45,220 --> 00:47:48,340
 Lots of previous episodes, some merch.

1474
00:47:48,340 --> 00:47:50,060
 There's the Portal to Club Fish,

1475
00:47:50,060 --> 00:47:51,060
 which is our member's club,

1476
00:47:51,060 --> 00:47:53,420
 where you can get all sorts of bonus content,

1477
00:47:53,420 --> 00:47:55,500
 really fun, ad-free episodes.

1478
00:47:55,500 --> 00:47:56,660
 Oh.

1479
00:47:56,660 --> 00:47:57,500
 - Do that.

1480
00:47:57,500 --> 00:47:58,500
 - Do that.

1481
00:47:58,500 --> 00:47:59,340
 - Get back in, Dan.

1482
00:47:59,340 --> 00:48:00,620
 (both laughing)

1483
00:48:00,620 --> 00:48:02,420
 - Tag me, tag me.

1484
00:48:02,420 --> 00:48:04,700
 We're also playing a live show in Sheffield in July.

1485
00:48:04,700 --> 00:48:05,540
 You should come to it.

1486
00:48:05,540 --> 00:48:06,660
 It's called The Crossed Wires Festival.

1487
00:48:06,660 --> 00:48:09,260
 It's a podcast festival, very exciting.

1488
00:48:09,260 --> 00:48:10,820
 But otherwise, just come back next week,

1489
00:48:10,820 --> 00:48:11,900
 where we'll have someone who actually knows

1490
00:48:11,900 --> 00:48:13,100
 how to helm this show.

1491
00:48:13,100 --> 00:48:14,860
 We'll see you then, Andy.

1492
00:48:14,860 --> 00:48:15,700
 - Bye.

1493
00:48:15,700 --> 00:48:17,380
 - Goodbye.

1494
00:48:17,380 --> 00:48:18,660
 - What, did I get that wrong?

1495
00:48:18,660 --> 00:48:20,860
 (both laughing)

1496
00:48:20,860 --> 00:48:23,440
 (upbeat music)

1497
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:26,020
 (upbeat music)

1498
00:48:27,020 --> 00:48:29,600
 (upbeat music)

1499
00:48:29,600 --> 00:48:32,180
 (upbeat music)
