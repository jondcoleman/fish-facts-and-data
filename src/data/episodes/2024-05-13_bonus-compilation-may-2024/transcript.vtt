WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580
 (upbeat music)

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:15.700
 - Hey, Clubfish members.

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:19.220
 Welcome to your bonus bit of content for this week.

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:20.400
 We've got a bit of a preamble,

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.380
 but this is an exciting preamble.

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:23.380
 So don't skip forward,

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:26.780
 'cause you'll miss out on some secret Clubfish information.

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:27.620
 Anna?

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:29.820
 - Yes, we have something to offer you

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.440
 as our extra special, most valued customers.

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:36.200
 And that is access to our tour.

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:37.620
 We're hitting the road.

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.520
 We are gonna be traveling around,

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:42.720
 performing our podcast in anywhere that will take us.

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:43.560
 - That's right.

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:45.580
 We are starting in September,

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:47.120
 going all the way through to November,

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.000
 and the tour will begin in Edinburgh,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.300
 where we're just gonna do a live podcast recording,

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:52.900
 then the full first and second half

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:57.200
 in Bristol, Dublin, Glasgow, Newcastle, Cardiff, London,

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.240
 where we're gonna be playing The Drury Lane.

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:01.900
 An old, West End classic.

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:03.200
 And then we go to Manchester,

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:06.140
 and then it's over to the other side of the planet.

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.980
 - That's right.

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:10.980
 Suddenly we pop from Manchester to Adelaide in Australia.

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:13.460
 We're doing Perth, Brisbane, Sydney, Melbourne,

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:16.860
 and then over to Auckland, Wellington, and Christchurch.

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.880
 We're making an earth sandwich of our tour.

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:21.000
 It's gonna be the podcast in a second half,

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.460
 and there'll be a brand new first half just for you guys.

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:27.460
 So to get tickets and check out those dates,

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:32.060
 go to knowsuchthingasafish.com/fishtour,

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:34.520
 and then when you are on the booking website,

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:36.760
 and you click their link to get your ticket,

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:39.400
 type in the code FISHTOUR.

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:41.680
 Basically, if you need to remember anything at any point,

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:43.640
 it is FISHTOUR.

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:44.480
 - That's right.

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:46.320
 So the tickets are going on general sale

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.400
 on the 17th of May, but as a club fish member,

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:52.800
 you are gonna get access to them on the 14th of May.

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:55.040
 Three days, three whole days,

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:57.060
 in which to glance around the seating map,

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.940
 pick your best spot, and get yourself a ticket

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:00.780
 to our show.

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:01.600
 We're so excited.

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:03.260
 The show is called Thunder Nerds,

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:04.860
 and it's gonna be a kick-ass tour,

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:05.860
 and we hope to see you there.

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:06.700
 - We do indeed.

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:09.140
 Enjoy spending that three days on the seating map,

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:11.700
 knowsuchthingasafish.com/fishtour.

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:12.820
 - Now, let's get to the main event

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:15.500
 for this week's bonus episode and its compilation,

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:18.140
 but this ain't no normal compilation ghettos

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:20.500
 because we have some exciting guests

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:22.300
 who have appeared in the last few episodes

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:24.220
 joining us as part of these outtakes.

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:26.800
 So, as well as James and Anna and myself,

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:29.360
 you're gonna hear the voices of John Lloyd.

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:32.600
 You're gonna get mathematician and comedian Matt Parker.

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:37.600
 There's the QILs, Lydia and Alex, and then that's it.

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:38.680
 But that's a hell of a lift.

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:40.840
 - It sure is, and we promise that in this compilation,

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:44.440
 Dan does not use the words "aint" or "kiddos" again.

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:46.540
 So don't fear on that score.

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:48.560
 Okay, on with the show.

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:50.020
 - On with the bonus comp.

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:54.760
 - That thing you're saying, Anna, about saffron,

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:57.760
 'cause a lot of this, as you say, Spanish saffron

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:58.960
 is often adulterated.

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:01.440
 And in 2019, trading standards in West Sussex

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:03.880
 seized three-quarters of a million pounds worth

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:05.040
 of adulterated saffron.

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.260
 - Wow, this is one small jar.

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:08.880
 (laughing)

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:12.600
 - There's a huge lot of food cheating going on right now.

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:15.560
 Two of the things that often have passed off

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:19.440
 is fake belug caviar and fake perigour truffles

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:22.920
 supposedly from France, but actually from China.

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:24.240
 And what's interesting how it changes,

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:25.800
 'cause in the period we're talking about,

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:29.400
 the 14th century, beluga caviar was so plentiful.

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:30.440
 It was the food of the poor.

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:33.240
 It was like, "Only poor people ate fish eggs."

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:35.040
 And similarly, with truffles,

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:37.040
 in the 14th century, nobody ate truffles.

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:40.880
 Only wolves, badges, pigs, and rats.

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:43.960
 And they only became fashionable in the Renaissance.

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:45.880
 So now they were, you know--

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:47.540
 - Like lobster in America.

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:50.600
 - Yeah, the people who starved to death in the first year

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:52.400
 because they wouldn't eat the horrible lobsters.

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:56.680
 - You know the Titanic, the first class passengers,

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:59.400
 we know what they ate 'cause we have the menus.

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:03.480
 They had one dish which contained something from a sturgeon.

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:04.880
 Can you guess what it was?

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:06.280
 (laughing)

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:07.360
 - Well, not caviar.

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:10.320
 - Not caviar, no, it was like a special soup made

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:14.520
 from the marrow from the spine of a sturgeon.

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:16.840
 Which is like, it was like a Russian delicacy

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:18.100
 that they used to eat back then.

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:19.620
 We don't really eat it now.

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:22.140
 - You can't get much marrow out of the spine of a sturgeon.

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:23.280
 - That's so expensive.

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:24.120
 - Yeah.

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:27.180
 There's a big lead poisoning problem on Earth.

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:30.260
 And this is a particular thing in Bangladesh

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.980
 where there were loads of like deaths from lead poisoning.

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:34.220
 And it's often really hard to find out

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:35.780
 why people are dying of lead poisoning.

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:38.500
 What it is, is it materials they're using,

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:40.980
 is it stuff they're eating off, is it in the water?

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:44.220
 And in Bangladesh in the 2000s,

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:46.300
 I think about 2015, 2016,

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:48.680
 they found that the main cause of lead deaths

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:50.680
 was from contaminated turmeric.

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:53.400
 So people were adding lead chromate to turmeric

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:55.520
 and that makes it a bright color.

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:57.680
 And this is just a nice happy ending story

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:02.680
 because in 2019, almost 50% of turmeric there contained lead.

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:05.120
 And this is causing, you know, many thousands,

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:07.200
 probably tens of thousands of deaths.

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:10.520
 And in 2021, when they'd clamped down on it,

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:12.680
 naught percent of turmeric contained lead.

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:14.280
 So imagine how many lives would have been saved

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:15.560
 in Bangladesh.

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:17.820
 And lead poisoning worldwide,

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:21.420
 according to a Lancet study recently,

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:24.760
 causes more deaths per year than HIV, malaria,

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:26.580
 and car accidents combined.

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:27.420
 That's fascinating.

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:28.740
 Isn't that extraordinary?

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:30.080
 That is crazy.

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:31.340
 We don't read about it.

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:34.180
 The social cost of it is six trillion a year estimated,

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:36.700
 which is 7% of the world's GDP.

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:37.540
 Lead poisoning.

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:39.820
 What does that mean, the social cost, sorry?

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:42.020
 Like, how much GDP are losing

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:43.300
 from all these people basically dying?

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:44.300
 Oh, wow.

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:45.640
 Let's say you can't go into work

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:47.120
 'cause you've got lead poisoning.

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:48.680
 That's some GDP lost.

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:49.520
 Exactly.

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:50.360
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:51.640
 And a good plausible excuse.

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:53.000
 Now you know how common it is.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:54.760
 I used to, and pawpaw, which was,

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:56.480
 you must know pawpaw from Australia.

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:58.320
 And it was the red tube that you would have.

00:05:58.320 --> 00:05:59.280
 It was kind of like an ointment

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:00.400
 that you would put on anything.

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:02.560
 Like, you know, it was usually for your lips,

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:03.400
 you know, to make them--

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:04.240
 Like Vaseline kind.

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:06.160
 It's kind of like Vaseline, exactly like that.

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:09.600
 They got busted not too long ago because it was found,

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:10.960
 you know, they really, it was like pawpaw.

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:12.960
 This is a pure, beautiful thing.

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:15.380
 And it only contained 6% of pawpaw

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:18.040
 in the actual ingredients as a result.

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:18.860
 And it was--

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:19.860
 Pawpaw as in the fruit.

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:20.700
 The pear.

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:22.100
 Yeah, it's like a, yeah.

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:22.940
 In the jungle.

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:24.280
 Yes, I know.

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:25.500
 Who's that?

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:28.340
 If you pick a pawpaw or a prickly pear,

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:31.420
 and you get a raw paw, well, next time beware.

00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:32.260
 Wow.

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:34.060
 Can you tell which of us have young children?

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:41.340
 Until May 2002, women in Lithuania

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:43.800
 had to have a gynecological examination

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:45.760
 in order to get a driving license.

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:46.360
 What?

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:47.780
 Isn't that extraordinary?

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:48.420
 Do we know the logic?

00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:48.920
 Why?

00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:50.860
 I don't know.

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:51.480
 In case--

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:52.440
 How interesting.

00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:55.320
 No, I actually can't even think of a comedy reason why.

00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:55.820
 No.

00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:58.440
 [LAUGHTER]

00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:01.240
 The thing about him was that he was such an incredibly

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:02.280
 determined person.

00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:03.880
 Renoir said if it wasn't for Monet,

00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:05.240
 we'd have all given up.

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:08.640
 Because he went on beyond the pain barrier all the time.

00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:10.680
 He used to get up well before sunrise every day

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:12.740
 to catch the right light.

00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:14.300
 And if the light wasn't right, he

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:16.740
 would go to any lengths to get it right.

00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:19.060
 So he had a period where he painted steam trains

00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:21.340
 at Garzana Lazare.

00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:23.700
 And he persuaded the director of the railway company

00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:27.980
 to stop the train to rule so that it would leave it

00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:30.860
 exactly the right time, so that the steam from the engine--

00:07:30.860 --> 00:07:31.500
 That's amazing.

00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:34.740
 So he closed the whole station.

00:07:34.740 --> 00:07:37.300
 All the platforms were shut, and then all the engines

00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:40.660
 were fired up so that it would be great clouds of steam.

00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:41.160
 That's--

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:43.960
 And then when he was painting his poplars,

00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:46.040
 he discovered the local council were

00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:48.360
 going to auction them off for timber.

00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:50.760
 So he went to the timber merchant and bribed him,

00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:53.640
 basically, not to cut down the trees if you want the thing,

00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:55.000
 until he'd finished the painting.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:55.680
 Wow.

00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:57.440
 He just never gave up on anything.

00:07:57.440 --> 00:07:59.520
 I've got a way to make him more efficient,

00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:03.120
 is he was going up before sunrise to get the best light.

00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:05.280
 There's not going to be any light until sunrise.

00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:07.720
 So that's an extra half hour he could have in bed.

00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:08.220
 I reckon.

00:08:08.220 --> 00:08:08.720
 Oh, yeah.

00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:10.160
 We don't have time to get out of your pyjamas.

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:11.220
 Who would he med with?

00:08:11.220 --> 00:08:13.980
 That's the thing, James, because he was so busy in that way.

00:08:13.980 --> 00:08:15.020
 That sounds like my house.

00:08:15.020 --> 00:08:19.380
 I'm just picturing now that, like, us

00:08:19.380 --> 00:08:22.180
 complaining about people taking selfies and holding us up.

00:08:22.180 --> 00:08:26.020
 But the old version of Monet, literally, I'm painting here.

00:08:26.020 --> 00:08:28.380
 The train can't go, is quite intense.

00:08:28.380 --> 00:08:30.780
 Yeah, and as someone who suffers from the train strikes,

00:08:30.780 --> 00:08:34.900
 this day and age, I know whose side I would have been on.

00:08:34.900 --> 00:08:37.860
 Yeah, this service will not be stopping at the next 10 stops,

00:08:37.860 --> 00:08:39.980
 because Monet wants to paint it.

00:08:39.980 --> 00:08:41.360
 What?

00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:42.880
 The old water lilies on the line again.

00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:47.640
 Just one last fact.

00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:50.960
 Why did the butcher replace half of the contents

00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:53.360
 of his sausages with bread?

00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:56.480
 OK, is this a quiz question, a puzzle?

00:08:56.480 --> 00:08:58.600
 No, this is a classic Chernobyl fallout.

00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:00.120
 And it takes a few moments.

00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:01.080
 That's my new joke.

00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:02.080
 It's a new joke.

00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:02.760
 Oh, yeah.

00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:03.320
 Say it again.

00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:04.720
 It's my joke of the year.

00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:08.520
 And I've actually stolen it from a podcast called Eat My Globe.

00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:11.020
 Why did the butcher replace half of the contents

00:09:11.020 --> 00:09:13.540
 of his sausages with bread?

00:09:13.540 --> 00:09:17.860
 God, to save money, because bread's cheaper than meat?

00:09:17.860 --> 00:09:21.100
 Oh, you're so close if you just reword that,

00:09:21.100 --> 00:09:25.340
 because he found it hard to make both ends meat.

00:09:25.340 --> 00:09:26.980
 Oh, good grief.

00:09:26.980 --> 00:09:30.020
 Well, it's just it's a really relevant joke to the subject.

00:09:30.020 --> 00:09:31.020
 Very good.

00:09:31.020 --> 00:09:33.940
 [LAUGHTER]

00:09:33.940 --> 00:09:37.020
 Do you think that makes up for the terribleness of a joke

00:09:37.020 --> 00:09:38.340
 that it's relevant?

00:09:38.340 --> 00:09:39.580
 I think as long as it's appropriate,

00:09:39.580 --> 00:09:41.160
 it doesn't matter at all if it's funny.

00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:44.200
 Yeah, that's what I've been working on the last 10 years

00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:45.000
 on this show.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:46.000
 This poor podcast.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000
 They're probably really great, really intelligent.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.880
 You picked the one little joke that they said in passing,

00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:52.080
 probably groaned at.

00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:53.280
 I have, yeah.

00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:55.200
 There you go.

00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:56.120
 Wow.

00:09:56.120 --> 00:10:01.520
 There was a famous incident in 1845 of bridge collapse.

00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:03.280
 I think we can talk about this, because it was almost

00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:04.480
 200 years ago, guys.

00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:06.160
 So we don't need to be too serious,

00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:07.300
 but it was sad at the time.

00:10:07.300 --> 00:10:10.980
 It was in Great Yarmouth, and it involved a clown,

00:10:10.980 --> 00:10:13.140
 as so many tragedies do.

00:10:13.140 --> 00:10:16.140
 Wow.

00:10:16.140 --> 00:10:19.140
 There was this huge event where a clown called Arthur Nelson

00:10:19.140 --> 00:10:21.880
 was trying to ride up the river in a wash tub drawn

00:10:21.880 --> 00:10:25.300
 by four geese, as happened in the days before TV.

00:10:25.300 --> 00:10:27.580
 And loads of people were going to go and watch.

00:10:27.580 --> 00:10:30.740
 And hundreds of people got onto the suspension bridge.

00:10:30.740 --> 00:10:32.700
 Suspension bridge is quite new then.

00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:34.860
 Onto this suspension bridge in Great Yarmouth

00:10:34.860 --> 00:10:38.680
 to watch the clown Arthur Nelson get pulled up the river,

00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:39.760
 drawn by four geese.

00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:41.520
 And as he went under the bridge,

00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:44.920
 everyone moved from one side of the bridge to the other.

00:10:44.920 --> 00:10:47.840
 And that moving caused the bridge to collapse.

00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:50.600
 The chain snapped, and 79 people were killed.

00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:51.360
 Oh my god.

00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:51.840
 I know.

00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:54.240
 Included-- did the bridge land on him, or was he OK?

00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:55.720
 I am delighted to report, because I

00:10:55.720 --> 00:10:58.920
 checked the newspaper archives to see if he continued working.

00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:00.240
 He did continue working.

00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:01.560
 He obviously got over the trauma.

00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:02.440
 He was not killed.

00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:05.780
 In 1857, he was still doing an extraordinary performance

00:11:05.780 --> 00:11:07.220
 on the pine harmonium.

00:11:07.220 --> 00:11:08.820
 So he survived.

00:11:08.820 --> 00:11:09.980
 That is extraordinary.

00:11:09.980 --> 00:11:11.660
 Yeah.

00:11:11.660 --> 00:11:12.540
 That's a load case.

00:11:12.540 --> 00:11:14.660
 The engineers didn't see coming.

00:11:14.660 --> 00:11:15.500
 Yeah?

00:11:15.500 --> 00:11:17.700
 A massive mass running from one side to the other.

00:11:17.700 --> 00:11:18.300
 To the other.

00:11:18.300 --> 00:11:19.180
 You wouldn't expect it would you?

00:11:19.180 --> 00:11:19.740
 It reminds me.

00:11:19.740 --> 00:11:22.060
 Do you remember there was that cruise ship?

00:11:22.060 --> 00:11:23.260
 Everyone was on this ship.

00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:24.500
 Yes, that's right.

00:11:24.500 --> 00:11:28.220
 And they went past another cruise ship where everyone was naked.

00:11:28.220 --> 00:11:28.700
 Yeah.

00:11:28.700 --> 00:11:30.540
 It was like a nudist speech or something, because of the distance.

00:11:30.540 --> 00:11:32.460
 And then everyone ran to one of the decks

00:11:32.460 --> 00:11:35.160
 to see what was happening, and capsized the ship.

00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:35.660
 I do.

00:11:35.660 --> 00:11:37.240
 Yeah, capsized, but yeah.

00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:39.960
 Usually, we'd remember a lot.

00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:43.400
 It's something me and Dan talk about a lot.

00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:45.280
 The famous one up near where I live

00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:47.800
 is the Broughton Suspension Bridge between Manchester

00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:51.360
 and Bolton, which collapsed in 1831,

00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:54.600
 and was supposedly because people were marching across it,

00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:58.040
 and that resonance caused the bridge to collapse.

00:11:58.040 --> 00:12:00.200
 I think that's the fur-- in my research,

00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:03.300
 that's the first bridge that collapsed due to resonance.

00:12:03.300 --> 00:12:04.300
 Really?

00:12:04.300 --> 00:12:07.380
 And the military from then on were always

00:12:07.380 --> 00:12:10.020
 told to break step when they cross over a bridge.

00:12:10.020 --> 00:12:10.520
 Yeah.

00:12:10.520 --> 00:12:11.820
 No one died in that one?

00:12:11.820 --> 00:12:12.320
 Yeah.

00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:12.820
 Right.

00:12:12.820 --> 00:12:13.900
 But there was no clown involved.

00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:14.940
 No clown involved.

00:12:14.940 --> 00:12:18.500
 [INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:12:18.500 --> 00:12:21.420
 Japanese games, I think is it Japanese Go?

00:12:21.420 --> 00:12:23.900
 We talk about computers earlier on.

00:12:23.900 --> 00:12:26.420
 In 2009, a survey of Go players guessed

00:12:26.420 --> 00:12:29.420
 it would be 20 years before computers outsmarted them.

00:12:30.420 --> 00:12:34.340
 And in 2019, the South Korean champion, Lee Seedol,

00:12:34.340 --> 00:12:37.220
 retired after being beaten by AlphaGo, which

00:12:37.220 --> 00:12:40.900
 was made by DeepMind, and basically said, that's it.

00:12:40.900 --> 00:12:41.940
 We're beaten.

00:12:41.940 --> 00:12:43.200
 Computers can beat us.

00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:43.700
 That's it.

00:12:43.700 --> 00:12:44.980
 No human can beat them.

00:12:44.980 --> 00:12:47.380
 Because Go was interesting because things like chess

00:12:47.380 --> 00:12:50.060
 is a lot of combinations that you can still

00:12:50.060 --> 00:12:53.060
 search a reasonable space in terms

00:12:53.060 --> 00:12:54.820
 of the number of possible future moves.

00:12:54.820 --> 00:12:56.780
 Whereas Go is just an outrageous number

00:12:56.780 --> 00:12:57.980
 of possible combinations.

00:12:57.980 --> 00:13:01.940
 So you couldn't just throw brute force checking at it.

00:13:01.940 --> 00:13:05.060
 You had to have some level of cleverness.

00:13:05.060 --> 00:13:08.040
 And it might have been the same person who said,

00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:11.540
 when you're looking at Go, it was like it was playing with either

00:13:11.540 --> 00:13:13.220
 like creative or new strategies.

00:13:13.220 --> 00:13:17.260
 Like it wasn't just doing things that had come before,

00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:18.540
 it was actually playing the game.

00:13:18.540 --> 00:13:19.940
 Yeah, absolutely.

00:13:19.940 --> 00:13:23.340
 But good news humans, for you humans.

00:13:23.340 --> 00:13:24.780
 Monopoly, they haven't cracked monopoly.

00:13:24.780 --> 00:13:25.660
 No.

00:13:25.660 --> 00:13:28.260
 In 2023 humans beat the best Go computer

00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:30.820
 for the first time in seven years.

00:13:30.820 --> 00:13:33.460
 But we were taught how to do it by another computer.

00:13:33.460 --> 00:13:35.460
 OK.

00:13:35.460 --> 00:13:38.100
 Basically, they set up another computer

00:13:38.100 --> 00:13:41.540
 to try and look for weaknesses in the game.

00:13:41.540 --> 00:13:45.580
 The computer found one and they told the human how to do it.

00:13:45.580 --> 00:13:47.380
 And then the human beat the Go computer.

00:13:47.380 --> 00:13:48.300
 OK, right.

00:13:48.300 --> 00:13:49.940
 OK, get the computers on side.

00:13:49.940 --> 00:13:52.500
 How do we know the computers are in cahoots?

00:13:52.500 --> 00:13:55.740
 They're like, look, the humans need a win.

00:13:55.740 --> 00:13:58.100
 They're going to get suspicious.

00:13:58.100 --> 00:14:00.100
 They have, I don't know if I've said this before,

00:14:00.100 --> 00:14:04.300
 but in Japan they have a museum of crashed trains basically.

00:14:04.300 --> 00:14:07.980
 So you go in and you see the banged up in the metal

00:14:07.980 --> 00:14:09.340
 and bent and all that stuff.

00:14:09.340 --> 00:14:10.500
 It's not open to the public.

00:14:10.500 --> 00:14:12.540
 It's purely for people who work in the industry

00:14:12.540 --> 00:14:15.260
 to show them how important every decision is

00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:16.620
 about what they do with safety.

00:14:16.620 --> 00:14:17.780
 You don't want this to, yeah.

00:14:17.780 --> 00:14:21.340
 It's just purely just like a morale booster for not fucking up.

00:14:22.300 --> 00:14:23.740
 Oh, he's still working there.

00:14:23.740 --> 00:14:25.140
 Let me show you something.

00:14:25.140 --> 00:14:26.220
 This could be you.

00:14:26.220 --> 00:14:29.260
 When my wife works, they still have bits of spacecraft

00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:32.620
 that deorbitant from the Ariane 5 rocket exploded.

00:14:32.620 --> 00:14:34.060
 And so they got in their coffee room.

00:14:34.060 --> 00:14:36.180
 There's like these burnt bits of twisted metal.

00:14:36.180 --> 00:14:37.780
 I'm like, that's someone's career.

00:14:37.780 --> 00:14:40.020
 Yeah, that didn't make it into orbit.

00:14:40.020 --> 00:14:41.540
 And she was in Tesco, doesn't she?

00:14:41.540 --> 00:14:43.020
 Yeah, no, it's terrifying.

00:14:43.020 --> 00:14:44.580
 It's so weird.

00:14:44.580 --> 00:14:46.180
 Clean up in aisle three, please.

00:14:49.460 --> 00:14:52.220
 When I was probably about, let's say,

00:14:52.220 --> 00:14:54.780
 I guess 10, so about in the late 80s,

00:14:54.780 --> 00:14:58.060
 my parents' school where they worked only had one computer.

00:14:58.060 --> 00:14:59.340
 And in the summer holidays,

00:14:59.340 --> 00:15:00.860
 my parents were allowed to take it home

00:15:00.860 --> 00:15:02.900
 and we were allowed to use it.

00:15:02.900 --> 00:15:05.700
 And like learn how to program basic and stuff like that.

00:15:05.700 --> 00:15:07.020
 Wow. It was really cool.

00:15:07.020 --> 00:15:08.900
 It's like taking home a school hamster.

00:15:08.900 --> 00:15:12.100
 Yeah, but we replaced it with a new one,

00:15:12.100 --> 00:15:13.420
 the look kind of the same.

00:15:13.420 --> 00:15:17.900
 You guys know the game of life?

00:15:17.900 --> 00:15:18.860
 Yes.

00:15:18.860 --> 00:15:21.540
 Do you know the super painful game of life?

00:15:21.540 --> 00:15:25.300
 Which was released in September 2014 in Japan.

00:15:25.300 --> 00:15:27.780
 And this was basically the same as the game of life,

00:15:27.780 --> 00:15:30.700
 apart from there was loads of very, very stressful events

00:15:30.700 --> 00:15:32.020
 all the way through it.

00:15:32.020 --> 00:15:34.900
 So it wasn't just like get married, have a job,

00:15:34.900 --> 00:15:38.100
 have kids and get to the end of the thing.

00:15:38.100 --> 00:15:40.220
 There would be things like,

00:15:40.220 --> 00:15:44.180
 you are busted for copying and pasting a letter of apology.

00:15:44.180 --> 00:15:47.500
 Or your parents read your secret poem.

00:15:48.500 --> 00:15:51.900
 And apparently it was like a bit more realistic

00:15:51.900 --> 00:15:54.500
 because in Japanese society around then

00:15:54.500 --> 00:15:55.500
 there was a lot of stress

00:15:55.500 --> 00:15:57.500
 and they thought this was a realistic game of life.

00:15:57.500 --> 00:15:58.500
 Nice.

00:15:58.500 --> 00:15:59.500
 Yeah.

00:15:59.500 --> 00:16:01.700
 I mean, the super painful game of life

00:16:01.700 --> 00:16:03.500
 does sound more like actual life.

00:16:03.500 --> 00:16:04.940
 Managing expectations.

00:16:04.940 --> 00:16:05.940
 Yeah.

00:16:05.940 --> 00:16:09.340
 Tom Hanks has a song called Colin.

00:16:09.340 --> 00:16:12.220
 Or Colin, whichever one you prepare.

00:16:12.220 --> 00:16:16.140
 And yeah, he started a handkerchief business.

00:16:16.140 --> 00:16:17.180
 And it's called Hanks.

00:16:17.180 --> 00:16:18.180
 No.

00:16:18.180 --> 00:16:19.180
 Yeah.

00:16:19.180 --> 00:16:21.780
 And it started during the pandemic,

00:16:21.780 --> 00:16:25.380
 beginning of the pandemic and it's shut now, unfortunately.

00:16:25.380 --> 00:16:26.380
 2023.

00:16:26.380 --> 00:16:28.900
 Someone wrote to him, which he responded to,

00:16:28.900 --> 00:16:31.100
 saying, "Hankskerchiefs,

00:16:31.100 --> 00:16:33.340
 have you ever thought of maybe changing the brand name

00:16:33.340 --> 00:16:35.820
 to 'Colin Hankees'?"

00:16:35.820 --> 00:16:37.580
 Which is a very nice one.

00:16:37.580 --> 00:16:38.580
 Hold on, I don't get it.

00:16:38.580 --> 00:16:39.580
 Was it like a colon?

00:16:39.580 --> 00:16:40.980
 It was like a hanky for your bum.

00:16:40.980 --> 00:16:41.980
 A colon hanky.

00:16:41.980 --> 00:16:42.980
 Right.

00:16:42.980 --> 00:16:44.180
 Wow, start this.

00:16:44.180 --> 00:16:45.780
 It's not what you call your loo roll.

00:16:46.780 --> 00:16:47.780
 Hunk.

00:16:47.780 --> 00:16:49.380
 We need more colon hankies in here.

00:16:49.380 --> 00:16:53.980
 Did he start this company because COVID had started

00:16:53.980 --> 00:16:56.180
 and he thought, what are people going to need handkerchiefs?

00:16:56.180 --> 00:16:59.380
 No, it was, I think it was in 2020 that he started it.

00:16:59.380 --> 00:17:00.580
 It was definitely in that period.

00:17:00.580 --> 00:17:03.580
 But it was, he loved handkerchiefs.

00:17:03.580 --> 00:17:04.580
 He did it.

00:17:04.580 --> 00:17:07.780
 But then part of the profit or the royalties of Perperchus

00:17:07.780 --> 00:17:10.780
 would go towards the, it was huge fires in America

00:17:10.780 --> 00:17:13.380
 and it was to the charities that were helping out with that.

00:17:13.380 --> 00:17:14.380
 The relief fund.

00:17:14.380 --> 00:17:15.380
 That's nice.

00:17:15.380 --> 00:17:16.380
 Does he love handkerchiefs?

00:17:16.380 --> 00:17:21.380
 I mean, I've got a lot of questions about his love of handkerchiefs actually.

00:17:21.380 --> 00:17:23.380
 Is that when someone called him masturbating once?

00:17:23.380 --> 00:17:26.380
 I'm not masturbating, I just love handkerchiefs.

00:17:26.380 --> 00:17:27.380
 I love handkerchiefs.

00:17:27.380 --> 00:17:29.380
 So I'm having sex with the love of my life.

00:17:29.380 --> 00:17:31.380
 Is that the argument?

00:17:31.380 --> 00:17:35.380
 Yeah, I mean, is it related to that name?

00:17:35.380 --> 00:17:37.380
 Has he said, "I love handkerchiefs because of my name?"

00:17:37.380 --> 00:17:39.380
 Or was he like, "Oh, I've never thought."

00:17:39.380 --> 00:17:40.380
 It was like, he's interviewed.

00:17:40.380 --> 00:17:42.380
 He's like, "Gosh, I'd never thought about that connection."

00:17:42.380 --> 00:17:43.380
 Yeah, first interview.

00:17:44.380 --> 00:17:45.380
 Got a hanks.

00:17:45.380 --> 00:17:46.380
 Yeah.

00:17:46.380 --> 00:17:48.380
 I think you're so right.

00:17:48.380 --> 00:17:51.380
 It's weird, isn't it, when you see a company name

00:17:51.380 --> 00:17:54.380
 that you know contains a rude word

00:17:54.380 --> 00:17:57.380
 and you can't not see the rude word.

00:17:57.380 --> 00:17:58.380
 So there are lots of examples.

00:17:58.380 --> 00:18:01.380
 The Italian arm of Volkswagen.

00:18:01.380 --> 00:18:03.380
 Well, can any of you guess?

00:18:03.380 --> 00:18:05.380
 The Italian arm of Volkswagen.

00:18:05.380 --> 00:18:06.380
 So it's Volkswagen.

00:18:06.380 --> 00:18:07.380
 Yeah.

00:18:07.380 --> 00:18:08.380
 Italia.

00:18:08.380 --> 00:18:09.380
 Oh, yeah.

00:18:09.380 --> 00:18:10.380
 Yeah.

00:18:10.380 --> 00:18:12.380
 And you just look at Volkswagen Italia on Instagram,

00:18:12.380 --> 00:18:13.380
 which is their handler.

00:18:13.380 --> 00:18:14.380
 And it says Genitalia in it.

00:18:14.380 --> 00:18:16.380
 And you can't, all you can see is the word genitalia.

00:18:16.380 --> 00:18:19.380
 And you think, how did they not see that?

00:18:19.380 --> 00:18:22.380
 And what's another good one?

00:18:22.380 --> 00:18:24.380
 What was the famous one, which was Susan Boyle?

00:18:24.380 --> 00:18:25.380
 Pen Island.

00:18:25.380 --> 00:18:26.380
 Pen Island.

00:18:26.380 --> 00:18:27.380
 Pen Island.

00:18:27.380 --> 00:18:28.380
 Pen Island, either.

00:18:28.380 --> 00:18:30.380
 It's Susan's album party.

00:18:30.380 --> 00:18:32.380
 Susan's anal bum party.

00:18:32.380 --> 00:18:38.380
 My mum's going to be so proud of me appearing on this podcast.

00:18:41.380 --> 00:18:44.380
 Molestation nursery in New South Wales.

00:18:44.380 --> 00:18:45.380
 Oh, man.

00:18:45.380 --> 00:18:46.380
 It's still, just still open.

00:18:46.380 --> 00:18:48.380
 I was actually reading some of the reviews.

00:18:48.380 --> 00:18:49.380
 Oh, yeah.

00:18:49.380 --> 00:18:50.380
 So it's obviously, if you look at the URL,

00:18:50.380 --> 00:18:52.380
 it just says molestation nursery.

00:18:52.380 --> 00:18:54.380
 Guys, it's genuinely taken me a while.

00:18:54.380 --> 00:18:55.380
 Oh, you've got to see it, I think.

00:18:55.380 --> 00:18:56.380
 You've got to see it.

00:18:56.380 --> 00:18:57.380
 Yeah, yeah.

00:18:57.380 --> 00:18:58.380
 I can't get it from the spoken.

00:18:58.380 --> 00:19:00.380
 It's molestation nursery.

00:19:00.380 --> 00:19:03.380
 And the reviews are all five stars except one.

00:19:03.380 --> 00:19:04.380
 Wonderful family run business.

00:19:04.380 --> 00:19:06.380
 When you think of it as a molestation nursery,

00:19:06.380 --> 00:19:08.380
 the reviews become really funny.

00:19:08.380 --> 00:19:10.380
 Fast, friendly and cost effective service.

00:19:10.380 --> 00:19:12.380
 And there's just one four star review that says,

00:19:12.380 --> 00:19:13.380
 I mean, it's good,

00:19:13.380 --> 00:19:15.380
 but the website is called molestation nursery.

00:19:15.380 --> 00:19:19.380
 I mean, you can also still just have nonsense as well.

00:19:19.380 --> 00:19:22.380
 And the A, the AAAA thing is still going on.

00:19:22.380 --> 00:19:23.380
 So on company's house,

00:19:23.380 --> 00:19:26.380
 I spent a long time looking at company's house website.

00:19:26.380 --> 00:19:30.380
 There are still two active companies with five A's

00:19:30.380 --> 00:19:31.380
 at the beginning of their name.

00:19:31.380 --> 00:19:32.380
 A, A, A, A, A.

00:19:32.380 --> 00:19:35.380
 There were two recently dissolved companies.

00:19:35.380 --> 00:19:38.380
 I found sextuple A aardvark.

00:19:38.380 --> 00:19:40.380
 So it just looks like aardvark.

00:19:40.380 --> 00:19:44.380
 And sextuple A, ABBA, and a septuple A,

00:19:44.380 --> 00:19:46.380
 so seven A's, abracadabra.

00:19:46.380 --> 00:19:48.380
 So I feel like at a certain point,

00:19:48.380 --> 00:19:50.380
 it's a death of imagination in this game.

00:19:50.380 --> 00:19:52.380
 At some point, the amount of money you make

00:19:52.380 --> 00:19:54.380
 from having a name like that,

00:19:54.380 --> 00:19:56.380
 you lose from the number of A's you have to buy

00:19:56.380 --> 00:19:58.380
 from the sign shop.

00:19:58.380 --> 00:20:04.380
 Search engine optimization is kind of what this is about.

00:20:04.380 --> 00:20:07.380
 And it used to be so much easier.

00:20:07.380 --> 00:20:10.380
 It must have been so fun in the '90s being a CODA,

00:20:10.380 --> 00:20:13.380
 because basically the way you got to the top of a search engine

00:20:13.380 --> 00:20:16.380
 was just how the search engine just counted

00:20:16.380 --> 00:20:18.380
 the number of times you'd used a certain word on your sign.

00:20:18.380 --> 00:20:21.380
 So people would build a website and let's say,

00:20:21.380 --> 00:20:22.380
 I don't know, it was a hairdresser.

00:20:22.380 --> 00:20:24.380
 I guess they just filled their website with the word "hair"

00:20:24.380 --> 00:20:27.380
 and a hairdresser over and over again, millions of times.

00:20:27.380 --> 00:20:28.380
 And you would quite often,

00:20:28.380 --> 00:20:31.380
 you would put the word "hair" in like 500 times,

00:20:31.380 --> 00:20:33.380
 but you'd make it the same colour as the background

00:20:33.380 --> 00:20:36.380
 of your website so people couldn't read it.

00:20:36.380 --> 00:20:38.380
 You didn't go on the website, just see the word "hair"

00:20:38.380 --> 00:20:40.380
 a million times, but you would hide it

00:20:40.380 --> 00:20:43.380
 so that the Google spiders could see it,

00:20:43.380 --> 00:20:45.380
 but normal people couldn't see it.

00:20:45.380 --> 00:20:46.380
 That's so clever.

00:20:46.380 --> 00:20:49.380
 How students cheat with word counts as well

00:20:49.380 --> 00:20:50.380
 when you have to upload it,

00:20:50.380 --> 00:20:52.380
 and it automatically generates the word count.

00:20:52.380 --> 00:20:53.380
 Did people do that?

00:20:53.380 --> 00:20:54.380
 Really?

00:20:54.380 --> 00:20:55.380
 No.

00:20:55.380 --> 00:20:57.380
 I should have done that with my book.

00:20:57.380 --> 00:20:59.380
 If there's 80,000 words, there you go.

00:20:59.380 --> 00:21:00.380
 Damn, it's three pages.

00:21:00.380 --> 00:21:03.380
 There's software now that picks up that there's hidden text,

00:21:03.380 --> 00:21:05.380
 but they just type in a load of rubbish

00:21:05.380 --> 00:21:08.380
 and it looks like there's 300 or 400 extra words there,

00:21:08.380 --> 00:21:09.380
 and just put it in white.

00:21:09.380 --> 00:21:10.380
 It's the same thing.

00:21:10.380 --> 00:21:11.380
 That's so funny.

00:21:11.380 --> 00:21:12.380
 Wish I'd done it.

00:21:12.380 --> 00:21:15.380
 Or if you've done too many words, you put it in as a picture.

00:21:15.380 --> 00:21:18.380
 That's good, because actually that was always my problem.

00:21:18.380 --> 00:21:19.380
 Damn it.

00:21:19.380 --> 00:21:20.380
 Too many words.

00:21:20.380 --> 00:21:21.380
 Yeah, and they were all shit.

00:21:21.380 --> 00:21:22.380
 Too many words and all shit.

00:21:22.380 --> 00:21:25.380
 It was often A star.

00:21:25.380 --> 00:21:28.380
 For everybody, I think there's a lot of things

00:21:28.380 --> 00:21:31.380
 that if you are a person who has not been pregnant,

00:21:31.380 --> 00:21:33.380
 you would not expect.

00:21:33.380 --> 00:21:36.380
 And I think the job of pregnant people is not to terrify everybody

00:21:36.380 --> 00:21:39.380
 by telling you what they are, but I'm going to anyway.

00:21:39.380 --> 00:21:45.380
 So one thing I didn't know is that your feet get bigger

00:21:45.380 --> 00:21:47.380
 and it's permanent.

00:21:47.380 --> 00:21:50.380
 Some women permanently go up a shoe size when they're pregnant.

00:21:50.380 --> 00:21:52.380
 It's nuts, because we've had three kids

00:21:52.380 --> 00:21:54.380
 and Fens and Clown shoes.

00:21:54.380 --> 00:22:00.380
 There was a guy in America that's how I found out about the story.

00:22:00.380 --> 00:22:03.380
 He was trying to do 40 days of Lent entirely

00:22:03.380 --> 00:22:06.380
 on what he calls liquid bread.

00:22:06.380 --> 00:22:09.380
 And liquid bread is beer.

00:22:09.380 --> 00:22:11.380
 And this is a thing that monks do.

00:22:11.380 --> 00:22:14.380
 He read about monks having done this, where they basically brewed

00:22:14.380 --> 00:22:18.380
 a really meaty, as it were, really packed beer

00:22:18.380 --> 00:22:20.380
 that you felt so full after having,

00:22:20.380 --> 00:22:22.380
 that it did feel like you were drinking it.

00:22:22.380 --> 00:22:25.380
 The story goes, which I can't be properly verified,

00:22:25.380 --> 00:22:28.380
 but the story goes is that they needed permission from the Pope

00:22:28.380 --> 00:22:30.380
 in order for this to be approved.

00:22:30.380 --> 00:22:32.380
 This is a few centuries ago.

00:22:32.380 --> 00:22:33.380
 They took it all the way there,

00:22:33.380 --> 00:22:35.380
 but the beer had spoiled on the way there.

00:22:35.380 --> 00:22:37.380
 And so when the Pope took a sip of it,

00:22:37.380 --> 00:22:39.380
 it was so disgusting or so rancid that he thought,

00:22:39.380 --> 00:22:45.380
 "Well, if anyone's willing to drink this, and yeah, okay, you can, fine."

00:22:45.380 --> 00:22:46.380
 That's the story.

00:22:46.380 --> 00:22:49.380
 And so there are monks that sort of drink liquid bread

00:22:49.380 --> 00:22:51.380
 throughout Lent.

00:22:51.380 --> 00:22:53.380
 Just sit and get pissed at their monasteries.

00:22:53.380 --> 00:22:55.380
 It's like, "Super size me, but with beer."

00:22:55.380 --> 00:22:57.380
 Yeah, exactly.

00:22:58.380 --> 00:23:02.380
 In the 19th century, there'd still be kind of rogue little denominations

00:23:02.380 --> 00:23:04.380
 where they said, "Look, you can still eat these."

00:23:04.380 --> 00:23:06.380
 Often probably by tradition.

00:23:06.380 --> 00:23:09.380
 But they're Oli Worm in the 17th century.

00:23:09.380 --> 00:23:13.380
 Yeah, Oli Worm, who's the son of Willem Worm.

00:23:13.380 --> 00:23:14.380
 Wait a minute.

00:23:14.380 --> 00:23:17.380
 Do you remember the very hungry caterpillar

00:23:17.380 --> 00:23:20.380
 was originally called "A Week with Willie the Worm?"

00:23:20.380 --> 00:23:21.380
 Oh, yeah, that's right.

00:23:21.380 --> 00:23:22.380
 Is it based on this guy?

00:23:22.380 --> 00:23:24.380
 Yeah, before it was a week with Willie the Worm,

00:23:24.380 --> 00:23:26.380
 it was a week with Willem the Worm,

00:23:26.380 --> 00:23:28.380
 because it was just debating liturgy.

00:23:28.380 --> 00:23:30.380
 Because he was a religious guy.

00:23:30.380 --> 00:23:32.380
 No, Oli Worm, who's probably actually called Oli Worm,

00:23:32.380 --> 00:23:34.380
 said that an ordinance had been passed

00:23:34.380 --> 00:23:36.380
 classing them as fish.

00:23:36.380 --> 00:23:38.380
 And he said as soon as that ordinance passed,

00:23:38.380 --> 00:23:41.380
 suddenly, because these geese were hanging out in France a lot,

00:23:41.380 --> 00:23:43.380
 exports from France to England and Scotland soared,

00:23:43.380 --> 00:23:45.380
 because the English and the Scots during Lent

00:23:45.380 --> 00:23:49.380
 were just desperate for something better than kind of shit, salted fish.

00:23:49.380 --> 00:23:52.380
 And Oli Worm is actually a sort of QI favourite,

00:23:52.380 --> 00:23:56.380
 because he also debunked the idea that unicorns exist.

00:23:56.380 --> 00:23:59.380
 He was the one who said they're actually just gnawls.

00:23:59.380 --> 00:24:01.380
 And he was the one who told us

00:24:01.380 --> 00:24:03.380
 Lemmings aren't spontaneously generated by air.

00:24:03.380 --> 00:24:04.380
 Oh, cool.

00:24:04.380 --> 00:24:05.380
 Oh, wow.

00:24:05.380 --> 00:24:07.380
 He was like an anti-pliny.

00:24:07.380 --> 00:24:08.380
 He's the anti-pliny.

00:24:08.380 --> 00:24:10.380
 Yeah, wow.

00:24:10.380 --> 00:24:14.380
 You know the story about how a dad furiously went into Target,

00:24:14.380 --> 00:24:18.380
 because he said, "Why are you recommending pregnancy stuff

00:24:18.380 --> 00:24:20.380
 to my child who's a high schooler?"

00:24:20.380 --> 00:24:22.380
 Sorry, Target is a...

00:24:22.380 --> 00:24:25.380
 Target's a big store in the America,

00:24:25.380 --> 00:24:28.380
 which is one of those stores where you can get everything you can get.

00:24:28.380 --> 00:24:29.380
 Like a Walmart?

00:24:29.380 --> 00:24:30.380
 Yeah, exactly.

00:24:30.380 --> 00:24:31.380
 For other Americans?

00:24:31.380 --> 00:24:33.380
 Yeah, exactly.

00:24:33.380 --> 00:24:35.380
 So the story is that the dad comes in and he's like,

00:24:35.380 --> 00:24:37.380
 "What are you doing sending emails to my daughter

00:24:37.380 --> 00:24:39.380
 recommending pregnancy stuff?"

00:24:39.380 --> 00:24:41.380
 And then it turns out she was pregnant.

00:24:41.380 --> 00:24:43.380
 And he wrote back apologizing saying,

00:24:43.380 --> 00:24:46.380
 "You know, I guess things are going on in my house."

00:24:46.380 --> 00:24:49.380
 I didn't fully realise, but she was pregnant.

00:24:49.380 --> 00:24:52.380
 And it's all to do with the fact that they have at Target

00:24:52.380 --> 00:24:56.380
 people who analyse all of the purchases that everyone has.

00:24:56.380 --> 00:24:59.380
 For example, they would notice that lots of people who were on the baby registry

00:24:59.380 --> 00:25:02.380
 were buying larger quantities of unscented lotion

00:25:02.380 --> 00:25:04.380
 around the beginning of their second trimester.

00:25:04.380 --> 00:25:07.380
 And so they thought if we can get in early and be the first people

00:25:07.380 --> 00:25:11.380
 to give them sort of discounts and stuff towards pregnancy stuff,

00:25:11.380 --> 00:25:13.380
 they would stay with us forever on.

00:25:13.380 --> 00:25:14.380
 They would buy their diapers from us,

00:25:14.380 --> 00:25:16.380
 because what they discovered was in later trimesters,

00:25:16.380 --> 00:25:18.380
 you suddenly just, all your hormones and everything

00:25:18.380 --> 00:25:20.380
 means that you lose brand association,

00:25:20.380 --> 00:25:22.380
 so you'll go somewhere else.

00:25:22.380 --> 00:25:25.380
 This is according to them.

00:25:25.380 --> 00:25:27.380
 Absolutely bullshit.

00:25:27.380 --> 00:25:29.380
 I did notice, Anna, when you were pregnant,

00:25:29.380 --> 00:25:32.380
 you started coming in and like owned brand trainers.

00:25:32.380 --> 00:25:35.380
 And you were the only, like, as the shreddies.

00:25:35.380 --> 00:25:38.380
 It was so hard. I'd find myself in Sainsbury.

00:25:38.380 --> 00:25:41.380
 I was like, "What? I thought I was a Tesco girl."

00:25:41.380 --> 00:25:42.380
 There's something wrong with my,

00:25:42.380 --> 00:25:44.380
 "I can no longer taste the difference."

00:25:44.380 --> 00:25:47.380
 I don't know what it is.

00:25:47.380 --> 00:25:49.380
 One more quiz.

00:25:49.380 --> 00:25:52.380
 In Poland, did you read about how a few years ago

00:25:52.380 --> 00:25:54.380
 they cancelled a certain bus that was on the way

00:25:54.380 --> 00:25:56.380
 to a place in Poland called Hell?

00:25:56.380 --> 00:25:58.380
 Okay, so 666.

00:25:58.380 --> 00:26:01.380
 It was a 666, and they genuinely cancelled it,

00:26:01.380 --> 00:26:03.380
 because they had so many Catholic complaints.

00:26:03.380 --> 00:26:07.380
 Obviously Poland has a strong Catholic contingent.

00:26:07.380 --> 00:26:09.380
 And on a Catholic website in 2018,

00:26:09.380 --> 00:26:12.380
 they wrote the 666 bus line running to Hell

00:26:12.380 --> 00:26:14.380
 to put it briefly and bluntly,

00:26:14.380 --> 00:26:16.380
 undermines the Christian order of the Polish state

00:26:16.380 --> 00:26:18.380
 and its foundations.

00:26:18.380 --> 00:26:21.380
 It's just the tip of the iceberg of a much greater problem.

00:26:21.380 --> 00:26:23.380
 Wow. When was this?

00:26:23.380 --> 00:26:25.380
 That was 2018, and they've just cancelled it,

00:26:25.380 --> 00:26:26.380
 or they cancelled it last year,

00:26:26.380 --> 00:26:28.380
 or changed the number to 669, I think.

00:26:28.380 --> 00:26:29.380
 Do you rate council at mid?

00:26:29.380 --> 00:26:31.380
 69 mid-year.

00:26:31.380 --> 00:26:34.380
 Oh, no, wait till this Catholic website is that,

00:26:34.380 --> 00:26:35.380
 and realises...

00:26:35.380 --> 00:26:37.380
 The devil's 69.

00:26:39.380 --> 00:26:43.380
 In ancient Rome, there was a whole thing about foreplay,

00:26:43.380 --> 00:26:45.380
 particularly Cunny Lingus being seen as something

00:26:45.380 --> 00:26:47.380
 that you just wouldn't do.

00:26:47.380 --> 00:26:49.380
 So a man to a woman would be like,

00:26:49.380 --> 00:26:51.380
 "Oh, you would get teased for it

00:26:51.380 --> 00:26:53.380
 if it was found out that you had done that."

00:26:53.380 --> 00:26:55.380
 But there's an idea that in Pompeii,

00:26:55.380 --> 00:26:57.380
 because how annoying is that,

00:26:57.380 --> 00:26:59.380
 because that's a nice sexual pleasure for a lot of people,

00:26:59.380 --> 00:27:01.380
 you would actually hire male sex workers,

00:27:01.380 --> 00:27:03.380
 specifically to do that.

00:27:03.380 --> 00:27:05.380
 So there's graffiti that they found in Pompeii

00:27:05.380 --> 00:27:07.380
 as part of the surviving...

00:27:07.380 --> 00:27:09.380
 I thought you were going to say they found the people,

00:27:09.380 --> 00:27:11.380
 because they were all in positions to be off the fight,

00:27:11.380 --> 00:27:13.380
 and then put in a museum.

00:27:13.380 --> 00:27:15.380
 You see the dust cloud coming,

00:27:15.380 --> 00:27:17.380
 and you're like, "Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no!"

00:27:17.380 --> 00:27:20.380
 "I told you I made you, and you will finish."

00:27:20.380 --> 00:27:24.380
 You might as well go out doing what you love.

00:27:24.380 --> 00:27:26.380
 Exactly.

00:27:26.380 --> 00:27:30.380
 In 2014, there was a dispute between a pig farm in Yorkshire

00:27:30.380 --> 00:27:32.380
 and a Wiltshire ballooning company,

00:27:32.380 --> 00:27:35.380
 because a hot-air balloon flew too near to a pig farm

00:27:35.380 --> 00:27:37.380
 and scared the pigs, and they all piled into a ditch

00:27:37.380 --> 00:27:39.380
 and various of them had...

00:27:39.380 --> 00:27:41.380
 I know, yeah, and like I said, then...

00:27:41.380 --> 00:27:43.380
 Such a funny image.

00:27:43.380 --> 00:27:45.380
 No, it's not funny, which is very bad,

00:27:45.380 --> 00:27:47.380
 because they very easy have heart attacks, stuff like that.

00:27:47.380 --> 00:27:49.380
 Some are heart attacks, some are miscarriages.

00:27:49.380 --> 00:27:51.380
 But it was very interesting,

00:27:51.380 --> 00:27:53.380
 because the person who managed to get compensation

00:27:53.380 --> 00:27:55.380
 for the pig farmer was a mathematician,

00:27:55.380 --> 00:27:57.380
 who was employed from the University of York,

00:27:57.380 --> 00:28:00.380
 Professor of Maths, because the hot-air balloon company said,

00:28:00.380 --> 00:28:03.380
 "We were told to stay X number of metres,

00:28:03.380 --> 00:28:05.380
 I think it was 500 metres away at least,

00:28:05.380 --> 00:28:08.380
 and we were at least 750 metres away from your farm."

00:28:08.380 --> 00:28:11.380
 He said, "You're way closer than that. You scared the pigs."

00:28:11.380 --> 00:28:15.380
 Now, his wife took a photo of the balloon in the air,

00:28:15.380 --> 00:28:17.380
 so you can see the size of the balloon,

00:28:17.380 --> 00:28:19.380
 you can see some trees underneath,

00:28:19.380 --> 00:28:21.380
 and they employed a Professor of Maths at the University of York

00:28:21.380 --> 00:28:23.380
 to deploy some trigonometry,

00:28:23.380 --> 00:28:25.380
 basically looking at the width of the balloon

00:28:25.380 --> 00:28:27.380
 and then the distance from the trees,

00:28:27.380 --> 00:28:29.380
 and then where the trees were in relation to the farm

00:28:29.380 --> 00:28:31.380
 to figure out exactly how far away the balloon was.

00:28:31.380 --> 00:28:32.380
 Forensics.

00:28:32.380 --> 00:28:34.380
 And prove that it was indeed closer.

00:28:34.380 --> 00:28:37.380
 That is good. I mean, no use for the pigs,

00:28:37.380 --> 00:28:38.380
 because they're already gone.

00:28:38.380 --> 00:28:39.380
 No use for the pigs.

00:28:39.380 --> 00:28:40.380
 Before you didn't get any compensation, yeah.

00:28:40.380 --> 00:28:42.380
 No, but that's interesting,

00:28:42.380 --> 00:28:44.380
 because I've been in the hot-air balloon relatively recently,

00:28:44.380 --> 00:28:45.380
 and you can't steer them.

00:28:45.380 --> 00:28:47.380
 You have to go where the wind takes you.

00:28:47.380 --> 00:28:48.380
 You go up or down,

00:28:48.380 --> 00:28:50.380
 and then you know which directions the winds are going

00:28:50.380 --> 00:28:51.380
 at different heights, right?

00:28:51.380 --> 00:28:52.380
 I suppose so.

00:28:52.380 --> 00:28:53.380
 So, if you're near the pigs,

00:28:53.380 --> 00:28:56.380
 you go upwards so that you're not too close.

00:28:56.380 --> 00:28:57.380
 Yeah, we'll go down.

00:28:57.380 --> 00:28:58.380
 If you're near the pigs, yeah.

00:28:58.380 --> 00:29:01.380
 But like, in terms of generally steering balloons in directions,

00:29:01.380 --> 00:29:03.380
 it's not massively controllable,

00:29:03.380 --> 00:29:04.380
 but the idea is that there are different air flows

00:29:04.380 --> 00:29:05.380
 at different heights,

00:29:05.380 --> 00:29:06.380
 so you can go up and down,

00:29:06.380 --> 00:29:07.380
 and then you can go in different directions

00:29:07.380 --> 00:29:08.380
 based on how high you are, I think.

00:29:08.380 --> 00:29:10.380
 Do we know the circumstances of the...

00:29:10.380 --> 00:29:12.380
 Balloons, obviously, quite difficult to control,

00:29:12.380 --> 00:29:14.380
 but you can't just say,

00:29:14.380 --> 00:29:15.380
 "I can't control my balloon at all."

00:29:15.380 --> 00:29:16.380
 So, bloody, go to the side of your house.

00:29:16.380 --> 00:29:17.380
 You can go up and down.

00:29:17.380 --> 00:29:18.380
 Yeah, you can go up and down.

00:29:18.380 --> 00:29:20.380
 If you want to stay away from the pigs, you go up.

00:29:20.380 --> 00:29:21.380
 Like, that's pretty easy.

00:29:21.380 --> 00:29:22.380
 Because the pigs can't fly.

00:29:22.380 --> 00:29:26.380
 The origin of "Porky Pig"

00:29:26.380 --> 00:29:29.380
 he was based on or inspired by a staple character

00:29:29.380 --> 00:29:31.380
 from traditional Italian comedy,

00:29:31.380 --> 00:29:32.380
 the Comedia dell'arte.

00:29:32.380 --> 00:29:33.380
 What was it?

00:29:33.380 --> 00:29:34.380
 Yeah, so like,

00:29:34.380 --> 00:29:36.380
 from between like the 16th to 18th centuries,

00:29:36.380 --> 00:29:38.380
 there was this traditional theatre comedy,

00:29:38.380 --> 00:29:41.380
 and it used all of these staple comedy characters.

00:29:41.380 --> 00:29:42.380
 Like the Harlequin.

00:29:42.380 --> 00:29:43.380
 The Harlequin was one, which is the servant.

00:29:43.380 --> 00:29:44.380
 I've got a whole list of them here,

00:29:44.380 --> 00:29:46.380
 like the El Capitano,

00:29:46.380 --> 00:29:50.380
 which is the indigent loner,

00:29:50.380 --> 00:29:52.380
 and the Pantalone, the Older Wealth and that.

00:29:52.380 --> 00:29:54.380
 From where we get Pantaloons, right?

00:29:54.380 --> 00:29:55.380
 Exactly, yeah, exactly.

00:29:55.380 --> 00:29:57.380
 Sorry, can I just ask that word that you said?

00:29:57.380 --> 00:29:58.380
 Indigent.

00:29:58.380 --> 00:29:59.380
 I don't know that word.

00:29:59.380 --> 00:30:00.380
 It means like stupid, I think.

00:30:00.380 --> 00:30:01.380
 Does it?

00:30:01.380 --> 00:30:02.380
 Oh, I think it means like poverty stricken

00:30:02.380 --> 00:30:04.380
 and like in a bad state.

00:30:04.380 --> 00:30:05.380
 Thank you.

00:30:05.380 --> 00:30:09.380
 All right, Jacob, I'll respond.

00:30:09.380 --> 00:30:12.380
 I don't know if,

00:30:12.380 --> 00:30:14.380
 because I didn't look into blank for this fact,

00:30:14.380 --> 00:30:16.380
 but presumably we've said the thing about

00:30:16.380 --> 00:30:18.380
 that he was in a coma when he was dying,

00:30:18.380 --> 00:30:20.380
 and the only way they managed to communicate

00:30:20.380 --> 00:30:23.380
 through to him was by talking to him as Bugs Bunny.

00:30:23.380 --> 00:30:24.380
 I think that was before he died.

00:30:24.380 --> 00:30:26.380
 I think he was in a car crash when he was younger.

00:30:26.380 --> 00:30:28.380
 Oh, it definitely all happened before he died, yeah.

00:30:28.380 --> 00:30:32.380
 The coma that he was in was not the one

00:30:32.380 --> 00:30:34.380
 being a seance as Bugs Bunny.

00:30:34.380 --> 00:30:36.380
 Yeah, that was it, wasn't it?

00:30:36.380 --> 00:30:37.380
 The doctor came in,

00:30:37.380 --> 00:30:38.380
 like everyone had tried to say,

00:30:38.380 --> 00:30:40.380
 "Mel, Mel, are you okay? Are you okay?"

00:30:40.380 --> 00:30:41.380
 And he wouldn't respond,

00:30:41.380 --> 00:30:43.380
 and then the doctor came in and said,

00:30:43.380 --> 00:30:45.380
 "Hey, Bugs, are you okay?"

00:30:45.380 --> 00:30:46.380
 Well, somebody said, "What's up, Doc?"

00:30:46.380 --> 00:30:48.380
 And the doc was like, "I'm all right."

00:30:48.380 --> 00:30:51.380
 And they made him work from his hospital bed, didn't they?

00:30:51.380 --> 00:30:53.380
 After he'd had this incredibly dramatic car crash

00:30:53.380 --> 00:30:55.380
 where he was in a coma for weeks,

00:30:55.380 --> 00:30:57.380
 and he was in the middle of filming the Flintstones,

00:30:57.380 --> 00:30:59.380
 I think, was he Barney?

00:30:59.380 --> 00:31:00.380
 Yeah.

00:31:00.380 --> 00:31:01.380
 And yeah, he was filming that,

00:31:01.380 --> 00:31:04.380
 and they replaced his voice for a few episodes,

00:31:04.380 --> 00:31:06.380
 so you can find some Flintstones episodes

00:31:06.380 --> 00:31:08.380
 where, you know, there's this rogue guy,

00:31:08.380 --> 00:31:10.380
 and then they shipped a bunch of audio equipment

00:31:10.380 --> 00:31:12.380
 into his kind of hospital bed,

00:31:12.380 --> 00:31:14.380
 and made him record from there.

00:31:14.380 --> 00:31:15.380
 Although I suppose it's only talking, isn't it?

00:31:15.380 --> 00:31:16.380
 Oh, can it be?

00:31:16.380 --> 00:31:22.380
 So, this is about people who live in Papua New Guinea.

00:31:22.380 --> 00:31:24.380
 In Papua New Guinea, in particular groups.

00:31:24.380 --> 00:31:26.380
 So, Dan.

00:31:26.380 --> 00:31:27.380
 Yeah.

00:31:27.380 --> 00:31:28.380
 You have got 100 pounds.

00:31:28.380 --> 00:31:29.380
 Okay.

00:31:29.380 --> 00:31:30.380
 Okay.

00:31:30.380 --> 00:31:32.380
 You're going to give Alex 100 pounds.

00:31:32.380 --> 00:31:33.380
 Yeah.

00:31:33.380 --> 00:31:34.380
 But there is one condition.

00:31:34.380 --> 00:31:37.380
 Alex has to share the 100 pounds with Anna.

00:31:37.380 --> 00:31:40.380
 He can decide how much of the 100 he's going to keep.

00:31:40.380 --> 00:31:42.380
 It could be you have 99 pounds, 99,

00:31:42.380 --> 00:31:43.380
 and Anna gets 1p.

00:31:43.380 --> 00:31:44.380
 That is what will happen.

00:31:44.380 --> 00:31:47.380
 But Anna has to agree to the deal,

00:31:47.380 --> 00:31:48.380
 otherwise you both get nothing.

00:31:48.380 --> 00:31:49.380
 Okay.

00:31:49.380 --> 00:31:51.380
 So it's always like a slight prison of delimory type thing.

00:31:51.380 --> 00:31:52.380
 Similar.

00:31:52.380 --> 00:31:55.380
 So how much are you going to Alex offer of Dan's money

00:31:55.380 --> 00:31:56.380
 to give to Anna?

00:31:56.380 --> 00:31:58.380
 I'm going to offer her less than half.

00:31:58.380 --> 00:32:01.380
 But also you could offer her as little as possible.

00:32:01.380 --> 00:32:02.380
 Does she know how much I'm guessing?

00:32:02.380 --> 00:32:03.380
 Anna knows the whole deal.

00:32:03.380 --> 00:32:04.380
 Okay, fine.

00:32:04.380 --> 00:32:06.380
 So the whole thing is working out whether Anna is spiteful enough

00:32:06.380 --> 00:32:09.380
 to say, "No, I won't allow this deal to happen."

00:32:09.380 --> 00:32:12.380
 Because if I did give her 5 quid, she's up on it 5 quid.

00:32:12.380 --> 00:32:13.380
 You've explained the logic.

00:32:13.380 --> 00:32:15.380
 And Anna is a horrible spiteful person.

00:32:15.380 --> 00:32:18.380
 So I don't think it's going to get anything less than like 90/10.

00:32:18.380 --> 00:32:19.380
 I think I'm going to end it with a 10.

00:32:19.380 --> 00:32:20.380
 So how much are you going to offer?

00:32:20.380 --> 00:32:23.380
 I'm going to offer her 30 pounds.

00:32:23.380 --> 00:32:24.380
 And I take Q70.

00:32:24.380 --> 00:32:25.380
 Anna, are you going to accept?

00:32:25.380 --> 00:32:26.380
 I would have taken 1p.

00:32:26.380 --> 00:32:31.380
 Greed over spite for me any day.

00:32:31.380 --> 00:32:32.380
 I don't care about fairness.

00:32:32.380 --> 00:32:35.380
 Well, the truth is that in general people tend to refuse the money

00:32:35.380 --> 00:32:38.380
 if they offer any lower than 25 pounds.

00:32:38.380 --> 00:32:40.380
 Not out of spite so much as they think,

00:32:40.380 --> 00:32:42.380
 "Well, why should I let you have anything?

00:32:42.380 --> 00:32:43.380
 You're being an asshole."

00:32:43.380 --> 00:32:45.380
 And I think I say 30 is kind of around that mark of, yeah.

00:32:45.380 --> 00:32:47.380
 Yeah, so yeah, I think you pretty much nailed it.

00:32:47.380 --> 00:32:50.380
 But among some groups in Papua New Guinea,

00:32:50.380 --> 00:32:52.380
 particularly the Au and the Ganau,

00:32:52.380 --> 00:32:56.380
 when people are offered above 50%, they're rejected.

00:32:56.380 --> 00:32:58.380
 And that is because in these cultures,

00:32:58.380 --> 00:33:01.380
 you get high status by giving people gifts.

00:33:01.380 --> 00:33:04.380
 And so if I give you more than 50%,

00:33:04.380 --> 00:33:07.380
 actually I'm saying I am now a higher status than you.

00:33:07.380 --> 00:33:08.380
 And if you accept it,

00:33:08.380 --> 00:33:10.380
 you're accepting that you're a lower status.

00:33:10.380 --> 00:33:12.380
 So if you offered Anna 70 quid, she would say,

00:33:12.380 --> 00:33:14.380
 "Well, no, I'm way better than you.

00:33:14.380 --> 00:33:16.380
 Why would I accept that much?"

00:33:16.380 --> 00:33:19.380
 I wouldn't, once again, because all I care about is the money.

00:33:19.380 --> 00:33:21.380
 None of these weird cultural hang-ups.

00:33:21.380 --> 00:33:25.380
 So there is this culture in Cambridge, which is very odd.

00:33:25.380 --> 00:33:32.380
 Do you guys know where you would find the world's longest bus?

00:33:32.380 --> 00:33:33.380
 World's longest bus.

00:33:33.380 --> 00:33:34.380
 I'll give you a clue.

00:33:34.380 --> 00:33:35.380
 Yeah.

00:33:35.380 --> 00:33:37.380
 There are 193 countries in the world,

00:33:37.380 --> 00:33:40.380
 and it would probably be in the last five you would guess.

00:33:40.380 --> 00:33:41.380
 Okay, Antarctica.

00:33:41.380 --> 00:33:42.380
 Like the Alphabet.

00:33:42.380 --> 00:33:43.380
 That's not a country, okay?

00:33:43.380 --> 00:33:44.380
 Okay, fine.

00:33:44.380 --> 00:33:46.380
 Although the Vatican, no.

00:33:46.380 --> 00:33:48.380
 And it takes up the whole of the Vatican,

00:33:48.380 --> 00:33:49.380
 one into the other.

00:33:49.380 --> 00:33:50.380
 Luxembourg.

00:33:50.380 --> 00:33:51.380
 No.

00:33:51.380 --> 00:33:52.380
 We're just naming countries now.

00:33:52.380 --> 00:33:53.380
 Yeah, I think that's good.

00:33:53.380 --> 00:33:54.380
 What did you expect in this game?

00:33:54.380 --> 00:33:57.380
 You set the premise.

00:33:57.380 --> 00:34:00.380
 This is why my quiz shows never go anywhere.

00:34:00.380 --> 00:34:03.380
 It is the Democratic Republic of Congo.

00:34:03.380 --> 00:34:04.380
 Oh, wow.

00:34:04.380 --> 00:34:05.380
 World's longest bus.

00:34:05.380 --> 00:34:06.380
 How long?

00:34:06.380 --> 00:34:07.380
 Because of the Congo thing.

00:34:07.380 --> 00:34:08.380
 And that's Congo.

00:34:08.380 --> 00:34:13.380
 Do you think other buses are creeping up behind it?

00:34:13.380 --> 00:34:14.380
 Yeah.

00:34:14.380 --> 00:34:18.380
 If they're all bendy as well,

00:34:18.380 --> 00:34:19.380
 they can go left, right, left, right.

00:34:19.380 --> 00:34:20.380
 Exactly.

00:34:20.380 --> 00:34:21.380
 You were a terrible one.

00:34:21.380 --> 00:34:23.380
 You went to Kinshasa that time.

00:34:23.380 --> 00:34:25.380
 You just walked behind everyone in the street,

00:34:25.380 --> 00:34:26.380
 just going...

00:34:26.380 --> 00:34:29.380
 So how long is it?

00:34:29.380 --> 00:34:30.380
 How long is it?

00:34:30.380 --> 00:34:33.380
 Well, three times the length of a London bus.

00:34:33.380 --> 00:34:34.380
 Okay.

00:34:34.380 --> 00:34:36.380
 It could carry 350 passengers comfortably.

00:34:36.380 --> 00:34:38.380
 This is the most appropriate use of a London bus

00:34:38.380 --> 00:34:40.380
 for length comparison that I've ever heard.

00:34:40.380 --> 00:34:41.380
 Yes.

00:34:42.380 --> 00:34:43.380
 I always say like...

00:34:43.380 --> 00:34:46.380
 Usually they say like, "Oh, the line is so long."

00:34:46.380 --> 00:34:47.380
 This dinosaur.

00:34:47.380 --> 00:34:48.380
 I don't know how long that is.

00:34:48.380 --> 00:34:49.380
 Yeah.

00:34:49.380 --> 00:34:52.380
 So it was 32.2 meters long.

00:34:52.380 --> 00:34:54.380
 How did it go around the corners?

00:34:54.380 --> 00:34:56.380
 I think a good question.

00:34:56.380 --> 00:34:57.380
 I thought the same.

00:34:57.380 --> 00:34:58.380
 Perhaps not so many corners

00:34:58.380 --> 00:35:01.380
 when you're going from one town to another.

00:35:01.380 --> 00:35:02.380
 Okay.

00:35:02.380 --> 00:35:04.380
 But how do you turn around must have been a nightmare.

00:35:04.380 --> 00:35:05.380
 Yeah, no, absolutely.

00:35:05.380 --> 00:35:06.380
 And was it the same...

00:35:06.380 --> 00:35:08.380
 Sorry, was it the same dimensions as a bus otherwise?

00:35:08.380 --> 00:35:10.380
 Was it enormous or was it just really, really long?

00:35:10.380 --> 00:35:12.380
 Imagine, you know those...

00:35:12.380 --> 00:35:13.380
 Do you know Optimus Prime?

00:35:13.380 --> 00:35:14.380
 Yeah.

00:35:14.380 --> 00:35:15.380
 Yes.

00:35:15.380 --> 00:35:17.380
 He's like a truck, right?

00:35:17.380 --> 00:35:18.380
 His head is a truck.

00:35:18.380 --> 00:35:19.380
 Right.

00:35:19.380 --> 00:35:20.380
 Where is this going?

00:35:20.380 --> 00:35:22.380
 I can't remember what they're actually called,

00:35:22.380 --> 00:35:23.380
 but you know where it's like...

00:35:23.380 --> 00:35:24.380
 Transformers.

00:35:24.380 --> 00:35:25.380
 No, no, no.

00:35:25.380 --> 00:35:27.380
 The type of truck where it's like a bottom...

00:35:27.380 --> 00:35:28.380
 Articulated lorry thing.

00:35:28.380 --> 00:35:29.380
 That's it.

00:35:29.380 --> 00:35:30.380
 It's like an articulated lorry,

00:35:30.380 --> 00:35:32.380
 but then it's got almost three bendy buses

00:35:32.380 --> 00:35:34.380
 at the back of it.

00:35:34.380 --> 00:35:35.380
 Right.

00:35:35.380 --> 00:35:36.380
 Oh, so it's like a train?

00:35:36.380 --> 00:35:37.380
 Yeah.

00:35:37.380 --> 00:35:38.380
 I mean, it's like a bus.

00:35:38.380 --> 00:35:39.380
 Yeah.

00:35:39.380 --> 00:35:40.380
 It's like a bus train lorry.

00:35:40.380 --> 00:35:42.380
 What is a train with a bus on rails?

00:35:42.380 --> 00:35:45.380
 It's like a bus train lorry, Optimus Prime combo.

00:35:45.380 --> 00:35:46.380
 It sounds amazing.

00:35:46.380 --> 00:35:47.380
 It just sounds completely unworkable.

00:35:47.380 --> 00:35:48.380
 How long did it last?

00:35:48.380 --> 00:35:51.380
 It was in use from 1989 to 2013.

00:35:51.380 --> 00:35:52.380
 Oh, quite a long time then.

00:35:52.380 --> 00:35:53.380
 Okay.

00:35:53.380 --> 00:35:54.380
 Yeah, relatively long.

00:35:54.380 --> 00:35:55.380
 But yeah.

00:35:55.380 --> 00:35:56.380
 I guess it's interesting like that.

00:35:56.380 --> 00:35:57.380
 It's the whole point of trains, right?

00:35:57.380 --> 00:35:59.380
 It's like high capacity things,

00:35:59.380 --> 00:36:01.380
 like rather than lots of little ones,

00:36:01.380 --> 00:36:02.380
 you have one big one.

00:36:02.380 --> 00:36:04.380
 Yeah, it makes sense to make it as big as you can.

00:36:04.380 --> 00:36:05.380
 Yeah.

00:36:05.380 --> 00:36:06.380
 I'm almost surprised that it's only that big.

00:36:06.380 --> 00:36:08.380
 I would say Guinness set up a competition

00:36:08.380 --> 00:36:10.380
 for the longest bus in the world,

00:36:10.380 --> 00:36:11.380
 because it's very easy to beat.

00:36:11.380 --> 00:36:13.380
 Only three times the length of a London bus.

00:36:13.380 --> 00:36:14.380
 So it's only one point five times the length

00:36:14.380 --> 00:36:15.380
 of one of those bendy buses.

00:36:15.380 --> 00:36:16.380
 Yeah.

00:36:16.380 --> 00:36:17.380
 They were completely...

00:36:17.380 --> 00:36:19.380
 It's only half the length of a Diplodocus.

00:36:19.380 --> 00:36:23.380
 In the end series,

00:36:23.380 --> 00:36:27.380
 I started thinking that sign-off of QI

00:36:27.380 --> 00:36:30.380
 was going to be neolithic newspaper nuggets

00:36:30.380 --> 00:36:32.380
 from the collection that I started

00:36:32.380 --> 00:36:34.380
 when I began the news quiz in the '70s.

00:36:34.380 --> 00:36:36.380
 Does that count as a neolithic?

00:36:36.380 --> 00:36:39.380
 Well, no, because I've got two

00:36:39.380 --> 00:36:41.380
 on people burning houses down.

00:36:41.380 --> 00:36:42.380
 Oh, wow.

00:36:42.380 --> 00:36:44.380
 That happen to be neolithic nuggets.

00:36:44.380 --> 00:36:46.380
 Sorry, you're bringing some research to the table

00:36:46.380 --> 00:36:47.380
 that is from the 1970s?

00:36:47.380 --> 00:36:48.380
 Yes.

00:36:48.380 --> 00:36:50.380
 That's incredible.

00:36:50.380 --> 00:36:51.380
 And it is.

00:36:51.380 --> 00:36:53.380
 This one's from the Baltimore Sun.

00:36:53.380 --> 00:36:56.380
 Andrew Schwartz, age 14 of Washington, D.C.,

00:36:56.380 --> 00:36:58.380
 used to spend his time setting off fire alarms,

00:36:58.380 --> 00:37:00.380
 but he underwent psychiatric treatment

00:37:00.380 --> 00:37:03.380
 to cure him of this, and he stopped doing it.

00:37:03.380 --> 00:37:05.380
 He learned that he should never break the glass

00:37:05.380 --> 00:37:08.380
 and press the button unless there actually was a fire.

00:37:08.380 --> 00:37:11.380
 So now he sets the houses on fire first

00:37:11.380 --> 00:37:13.380
 and has done so four times.

00:37:13.380 --> 00:37:17.380
 And this other one from the Bangkok Post.

00:37:17.380 --> 00:37:20.380
 Commenting on a complaint from Mr Arthur Purdy

00:37:20.380 --> 00:37:24.380
 about a large gas bill, a spokesman for Northwest Gas said,

00:37:24.380 --> 00:37:27.380
 "We agree it was rather high for the time of year.

00:37:27.380 --> 00:37:30.380
 It's possible Mr Purdy has been charged for the gas

00:37:30.380 --> 00:37:34.380
 used up during the explosion that blew his house to pieces."

00:37:34.380 --> 00:37:37.380
 (LAUGHTER)

00:37:37.380 --> 00:37:38.380
 Wow.

00:37:38.380 --> 00:37:41.380
 Imagine if James now cuts that from the show.

00:37:41.380 --> 00:37:45.380
 50 years of waiting for this research to finally be revealed.

00:37:45.380 --> 00:37:46.380
 There you go.

00:37:46.380 --> 00:37:48.380
 There is all of our outtakes.

00:37:48.380 --> 00:37:49.380
 Thanks everyone for listening.

00:37:49.380 --> 00:37:51.380
 Just one more reminder before you switch off.

00:37:51.380 --> 00:37:55.380
 If you do want to come see us live on stage doing our new tour,

00:37:55.380 --> 00:37:57.380
 Thundernerds, you can do that.

00:37:57.380 --> 00:38:00.380
 And you, as a clubfish member, will get pre-sale access

00:38:00.380 --> 00:38:04.380
 three days before general sale on the 14th of May.

00:38:04.380 --> 00:38:06.380
 So get in on the 14th of May

00:38:06.380 --> 00:38:08.380
 and all you need to do is head to...

00:38:08.380 --> 00:38:12.380
 No such thing as a fish.com/fishtour.

00:38:12.380 --> 00:38:14.380
 And then when you're through to the booking website

00:38:14.380 --> 00:38:18.380
 and you click to book your tickets, type in the code FISHTOUR.

00:38:18.380 --> 00:38:19.380
 All right.

00:38:19.380 --> 00:38:20.380
 Don't tell anyone.

00:38:20.380 --> 00:38:22.380
 Don't tell the non-believers of the clubfish.

00:38:22.380 --> 00:38:24.380
 It's our little secret.

00:38:24.380 --> 00:38:25.380
 All right. See you all later.

00:38:25.380 --> 00:38:28.380
 We'll catch you again in a couple of weeks with another bonus episode.

00:38:28.380 --> 00:38:29.380
 And until then,

00:38:29.380 --> 00:38:33.380
 we will be back on the main feed with another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish

00:38:33.380 --> 00:38:34.380
 on a regular Friday.

00:38:34.380 --> 00:38:35.380
 See you then.
