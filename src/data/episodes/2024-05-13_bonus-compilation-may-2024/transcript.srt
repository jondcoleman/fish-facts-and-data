1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:15,700
 - Hey, Clubfish members.

3
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:19,220
 Welcome to your bonus bit of content for this week.

4
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:20,400
 We've got a bit of a preamble,

5
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,380
 but this is an exciting preamble.

6
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:23,380
 So don't skip forward,

7
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:26,780
 'cause you'll miss out on some secret Clubfish information.

8
00:00:26,780 --> 00:00:27,620
 Anna?

9
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:29,820
 - Yes, we have something to offer you

10
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:33,440
 as our extra special, most valued customers.

11
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:36,200
 And that is access to our tour.

12
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:37,620
 We're hitting the road.

13
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:39,520
 We are gonna be traveling around,

14
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:42,720
 performing our podcast in anywhere that will take us.

15
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:43,560
 - That's right.

16
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:45,580
 We are starting in September,

17
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:47,120
 going all the way through to November,

18
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:49,000
 and the tour will begin in Edinburgh,

19
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,300
 where we're just gonna do a live podcast recording,

20
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:52,900
 then the full first and second half

21
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:57,200
 in Bristol, Dublin, Glasgow, Newcastle, Cardiff, London,

22
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:59,240
 where we're gonna be playing The Drury Lane.

23
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:01,900
 An old, West End classic.

24
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:03,200
 And then we go to Manchester,

25
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:06,140
 and then it's over to the other side of the planet.

26
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:06,980
 - That's right.

27
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:10,980
 Suddenly we pop from Manchester to Adelaide in Australia.

28
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:13,460
 We're doing Perth, Brisbane, Sydney, Melbourne,

29
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:16,860
 and then over to Auckland, Wellington, and Christchurch.

30
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:18,880
 We're making an earth sandwich of our tour.

31
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:21,000
 It's gonna be the podcast in a second half,

32
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,460
 and there'll be a brand new first half just for you guys.

33
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:27,460
 So to get tickets and check out those dates,

34
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:32,060
 go to knowsuchthingasafish.com/fishtour,

35
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:34,520
 and then when you are on the booking website,

36
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:36,760
 and you click their link to get your ticket,

37
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:39,400
 type in the code FISHTOUR.

38
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:41,680
 Basically, if you need to remember anything at any point,

39
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,640
 it is FISHTOUR.

40
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:44,480
 - That's right.

41
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:46,320
 So the tickets are going on general sale

42
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:49,400
 on the 17th of May, but as a club fish member,

43
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:52,800
 you are gonna get access to them on the 14th of May.

44
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:55,040
 Three days, three whole days,

45
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,060
 in which to glance around the seating map,

46
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:59,940
 pick your best spot, and get yourself a ticket

47
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:00,780
 to our show.

48
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:01,600
 We're so excited.

49
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,260
 The show is called Thunder Nerds,

50
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:04,860
 and it's gonna be a kick-ass tour,

51
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:05,860
 and we hope to see you there.

52
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:06,700
 - We do indeed.

53
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:09,140
 Enjoy spending that three days on the seating map,

54
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:11,700
 knowsuchthingasafish.com/fishtour.

55
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:12,820
 - Now, let's get to the main event

56
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:15,500
 for this week's bonus episode and its compilation,

57
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:18,140
 but this ain't no normal compilation ghettos

58
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:20,500
 because we have some exciting guests

59
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:22,300
 who have appeared in the last few episodes

60
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:24,220
 joining us as part of these outtakes.

61
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:26,800
 So, as well as James and Anna and myself,

62
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,360
 you're gonna hear the voices of John Lloyd.

63
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:32,600
 You're gonna get mathematician and comedian Matt Parker.

64
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:37,600
 There's the QILs, Lydia and Alex, and then that's it.

65
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:38,680
 But that's a hell of a lift.

66
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:40,840
 - It sure is, and we promise that in this compilation,

67
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:44,440
 Dan does not use the words "aint" or "kiddos" again.

68
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:46,540
 So don't fear on that score.

69
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:48,560
 Okay, on with the show.

70
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,020
 - On with the bonus comp.

71
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:54,760
 - That thing you're saying, Anna, about saffron,

72
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:57,760
 'cause a lot of this, as you say, Spanish saffron

73
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:58,960
 is often adulterated.

74
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:01,440
 And in 2019, trading standards in West Sussex

75
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,880
 seized three-quarters of a million pounds worth

76
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:05,040
 of adulterated saffron.

77
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,260
 - Wow, this is one small jar.

78
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:08,880
 (laughing)

79
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:12,600
 - There's a huge lot of food cheating going on right now.

80
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:15,560
 Two of the things that often have passed off

81
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:19,440
 is fake belug caviar and fake perigour truffles

82
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:22,920
 supposedly from France, but actually from China.

83
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,240
 And what's interesting how it changes,

84
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,800
 'cause in the period we're talking about,

85
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:29,400
 the 14th century, beluga caviar was so plentiful.

86
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,440
 It was the food of the poor.

87
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:33,240
 It was like, "Only poor people ate fish eggs."

88
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:35,040
 And similarly, with truffles,

89
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,040
 in the 14th century, nobody ate truffles.

90
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:40,880
 Only wolves, badges, pigs, and rats.

91
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:43,960
 And they only became fashionable in the Renaissance.

92
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,880
 So now they were, you know--

93
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:47,540
 - Like lobster in America.

94
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:50,600
 - Yeah, the people who starved to death in the first year

95
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,400
 because they wouldn't eat the horrible lobsters.

96
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:56,680
 - You know the Titanic, the first class passengers,

97
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:59,400
 we know what they ate 'cause we have the menus.

98
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:03,480
 They had one dish which contained something from a sturgeon.

99
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:04,880
 Can you guess what it was?

100
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:06,280
 (laughing)

101
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,360
 - Well, not caviar.

102
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,320
 - Not caviar, no, it was like a special soup made

103
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:14,520
 from the marrow from the spine of a sturgeon.

104
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,840
 Which is like, it was like a Russian delicacy

105
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:18,100
 that they used to eat back then.

106
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:19,620
 We don't really eat it now.

107
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:22,140
 - You can't get much marrow out of the spine of a sturgeon.

108
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:23,280
 - That's so expensive.

109
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,120
 - Yeah.

110
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:27,180
 There's a big lead poisoning problem on Earth.

111
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:30,260
 And this is a particular thing in Bangladesh

112
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:32,980
 where there were loads of like deaths from lead poisoning.

113
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:34,220
 And it's often really hard to find out

114
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:35,780
 why people are dying of lead poisoning.

115
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:38,500
 What it is, is it materials they're using,

116
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:40,980
 is it stuff they're eating off, is it in the water?

117
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:44,220
 And in Bangladesh in the 2000s,

118
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:46,300
 I think about 2015, 2016,

119
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:48,680
 they found that the main cause of lead deaths

120
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:50,680
 was from contaminated turmeric.

121
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:53,400
 So people were adding lead chromate to turmeric

122
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,520
 and that makes it a bright color.

123
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,680
 And this is just a nice happy ending story

124
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:02,680
 because in 2019, almost 50% of turmeric there contained lead.

125
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:05,120
 And this is causing, you know, many thousands,

126
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,200
 probably tens of thousands of deaths.

127
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:10,520
 And in 2021, when they'd clamped down on it,

128
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:12,680
 naught percent of turmeric contained lead.

129
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,280
 So imagine how many lives would have been saved

130
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:15,560
 in Bangladesh.

131
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:17,820
 And lead poisoning worldwide,

132
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:21,420
 according to a Lancet study recently,

133
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:24,760
 causes more deaths per year than HIV, malaria,

134
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:26,580
 and car accidents combined.

135
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:27,420
 That's fascinating.

136
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:28,740
 Isn't that extraordinary?

137
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:30,080
 That is crazy.

138
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,340
 We don't read about it.

139
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:34,180
 The social cost of it is six trillion a year estimated,

140
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:36,700
 which is 7% of the world's GDP.

141
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:37,540
 Lead poisoning.

142
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:39,820
 What does that mean, the social cost, sorry?

143
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:42,020
 Like, how much GDP are losing

144
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:43,300
 from all these people basically dying?

145
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:44,300
 Oh, wow.

146
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:45,640
 Let's say you can't go into work

147
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:47,120
 'cause you've got lead poisoning.

148
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,680
 That's some GDP lost.

149
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:49,520
 Exactly.

150
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,360
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

151
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:51,640
 And a good plausible excuse.

152
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:53,000
 Now you know how common it is.

153
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,760
 I used to, and pawpaw, which was,

154
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:56,480
 you must know pawpaw from Australia.

155
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:58,320
 And it was the red tube that you would have.

156
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,280
 It was kind of like an ointment

157
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,400
 that you would put on anything.

158
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,560
 Like, you know, it was usually for your lips,

159
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,400
 you know, to make them--

160
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:04,240
 Like Vaseline kind.

161
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,160
 It's kind of like Vaseline, exactly like that.

162
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:09,600
 They got busted not too long ago because it was found,

163
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,960
 you know, they really, it was like pawpaw.

164
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,960
 This is a pure, beautiful thing.

165
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,380
 And it only contained 6% of pawpaw

166
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:18,040
 in the actual ingredients as a result.

167
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:18,860
 And it was--

168
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:19,860
 Pawpaw as in the fruit.

169
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:20,700
 The pear.

170
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:22,100
 Yeah, it's like a, yeah.

171
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:22,940
 In the jungle.

172
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:24,280
 Yes, I know.

173
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:25,500
 Who's that?

174
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:28,340
 If you pick a pawpaw or a prickly pear,

175
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:31,420
 and you get a raw paw, well, next time beware.

176
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:32,260
 Wow.

177
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:34,060
 Can you tell which of us have young children?

178
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:41,340
 Until May 2002, women in Lithuania

179
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:43,800
 had to have a gynecological examination

180
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,760
 in order to get a driving license.

181
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:46,360
 What?

182
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,780
 Isn't that extraordinary?

183
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:48,420
 Do we know the logic?

184
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:48,920
 Why?

185
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,860
 I don't know.

186
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:51,480
 In case--

187
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,440
 How interesting.

188
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:55,320
 No, I actually can't even think of a comedy reason why.

189
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:55,820
 No.

190
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:58,440
 [LAUGHTER]

191
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:01,240
 The thing about him was that he was such an incredibly

192
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:02,280
 determined person.

193
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:03,880
 Renoir said if it wasn't for Monet,

194
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:05,240
 we'd have all given up.

195
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:08,640
 Because he went on beyond the pain barrier all the time.

196
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:10,680
 He used to get up well before sunrise every day

197
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,740
 to catch the right light.

198
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:14,300
 And if the light wasn't right, he

199
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:16,740
 would go to any lengths to get it right.

200
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:19,060
 So he had a period where he painted steam trains

201
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:21,340
 at Garzana Lazare.

202
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:23,700
 And he persuaded the director of the railway company

203
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:27,980
 to stop the train to rule so that it would leave it

204
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:30,860
 exactly the right time, so that the steam from the engine--

205
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:31,500
 That's amazing.

206
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:34,740
 So he closed the whole station.

207
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:37,300
 All the platforms were shut, and then all the engines

208
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:40,660
 were fired up so that it would be great clouds of steam.

209
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:41,160
 That's--

210
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:43,960
 And then when he was painting his poplars,

211
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:46,040
 he discovered the local council were

212
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:48,360
 going to auction them off for timber.

213
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:50,760
 So he went to the timber merchant and bribed him,

214
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:53,640
 basically, not to cut down the trees if you want the thing,

215
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,000
 until he'd finished the painting.

216
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:55,680
 Wow.

217
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,440
 He just never gave up on anything.

218
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,520
 I've got a way to make him more efficient,

219
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:03,120
 is he was going up before sunrise to get the best light.

220
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,280
 There's not going to be any light until sunrise.

221
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,720
 So that's an extra half hour he could have in bed.

222
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:08,220
 I reckon.

223
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:08,720
 Oh, yeah.

224
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,160
 We don't have time to get out of your pyjamas.

225
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,220
 Who would he med with?

226
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:13,980
 That's the thing, James, because he was so busy in that way.

227
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:15,020
 That sounds like my house.

228
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:19,380
 I'm just picturing now that, like, us

229
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:22,180
 complaining about people taking selfies and holding us up.

230
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:26,020
 But the old version of Monet, literally, I'm painting here.

231
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:28,380
 The train can't go, is quite intense.

232
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:30,780
 Yeah, and as someone who suffers from the train strikes,

233
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:34,900
 this day and age, I know whose side I would have been on.

234
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:37,860
 Yeah, this service will not be stopping at the next 10 stops,

235
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:39,980
 because Monet wants to paint it.

236
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:41,360
 What?

237
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,880
 The old water lilies on the line again.

238
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:47,640
 Just one last fact.

239
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:50,960
 Why did the butcher replace half of the contents

240
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:53,360
 of his sausages with bread?

241
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:56,480
 OK, is this a quiz question, a puzzle?

242
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,600
 No, this is a classic Chernobyl fallout.

243
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,120
 And it takes a few moments.

244
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,080
 That's my new joke.

245
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,080
 It's a new joke.

246
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:02,760
 Oh, yeah.

247
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:03,320
 Say it again.

248
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,720
 It's my joke of the year.

249
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:08,520
 And I've actually stolen it from a podcast called Eat My Globe.

250
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:11,020
 Why did the butcher replace half of the contents

251
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:13,540
 of his sausages with bread?

252
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:17,860
 God, to save money, because bread's cheaper than meat?

253
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:21,100
 Oh, you're so close if you just reword that,

254
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:25,340
 because he found it hard to make both ends meat.

255
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:26,980
 Oh, good grief.

256
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:30,020
 Well, it's just it's a really relevant joke to the subject.

257
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:31,020
 Very good.

258
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:33,940
 [LAUGHTER]

259
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:37,020
 Do you think that makes up for the terribleness of a joke

260
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:38,340
 that it's relevant?

261
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:39,580
 I think as long as it's appropriate,

262
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:41,160
 it doesn't matter at all if it's funny.

263
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:44,200
 Yeah, that's what I've been working on the last 10 years

264
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,000
 on this show.

265
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
 This poor podcast.

266
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
 They're probably really great, really intelligent.

267
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,880
 You picked the one little joke that they said in passing,

268
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,080
 probably groaned at.

269
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,280
 I have, yeah.

270
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:55,200
 There you go.

271
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,120
 Wow.

272
00:09:56,120 --> 00:10:01,520
 There was a famous incident in 1845 of bridge collapse.

273
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:03,280
 I think we can talk about this, because it was almost

274
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:04,480
 200 years ago, guys.

275
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,160
 So we don't need to be too serious,

276
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,300
 but it was sad at the time.

277
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:10,980
 It was in Great Yarmouth, and it involved a clown,

278
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:13,140
 as so many tragedies do.

279
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:16,140
 Wow.

280
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:19,140
 There was this huge event where a clown called Arthur Nelson

281
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:21,880
 was trying to ride up the river in a wash tub drawn

282
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:25,300
 by four geese, as happened in the days before TV.

283
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:27,580
 And loads of people were going to go and watch.

284
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:30,740
 And hundreds of people got onto the suspension bridge.

285
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:32,700
 Suspension bridge is quite new then.

286
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:34,860
 Onto this suspension bridge in Great Yarmouth

287
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:38,680
 to watch the clown Arthur Nelson get pulled up the river,

288
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:39,760
 drawn by four geese.

289
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,520
 And as he went under the bridge,

290
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:44,920
 everyone moved from one side of the bridge to the other.

291
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:47,840
 And that moving caused the bridge to collapse.

292
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:50,600
 The chain snapped, and 79 people were killed.

293
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:51,360
 Oh my god.

294
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:51,840
 I know.

295
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:54,240
 Included-- did the bridge land on him, or was he OK?

296
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,720
 I am delighted to report, because I

297
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:58,920
 checked the newspaper archives to see if he continued working.

298
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:00,240
 He did continue working.

299
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,560
 He obviously got over the trauma.

300
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:02,440
 He was not killed.

301
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:05,780
 In 1857, he was still doing an extraordinary performance

302
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:07,220
 on the pine harmonium.

303
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:08,820
 So he survived.

304
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:09,980
 That is extraordinary.

305
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:11,660
 Yeah.

306
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:12,540
 That's a load case.

307
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:14,660
 The engineers didn't see coming.

308
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:15,500
 Yeah?

309
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:17,700
 A massive mass running from one side to the other.

310
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:18,300
 To the other.

311
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:19,180
 You wouldn't expect it would you?

312
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:19,740
 It reminds me.

313
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:22,060
 Do you remember there was that cruise ship?

314
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:23,260
 Everyone was on this ship.

315
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:24,500
 Yes, that's right.

316
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:28,220
 And they went past another cruise ship where everyone was naked.

317
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:28,700
 Yeah.

318
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:30,540
 It was like a nudist speech or something, because of the distance.

319
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:32,460
 And then everyone ran to one of the decks

320
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:35,160
 to see what was happening, and capsized the ship.

321
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:35,660
 I do.

322
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:37,240
 Yeah, capsized, but yeah.

323
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:39,960
 Usually, we'd remember a lot.

324
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:43,400
 It's something me and Dan talk about a lot.

325
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:45,280
 The famous one up near where I live

326
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:47,800
 is the Broughton Suspension Bridge between Manchester

327
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:51,360
 and Bolton, which collapsed in 1831,

328
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:54,600
 and was supposedly because people were marching across it,

329
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:58,040
 and that resonance caused the bridge to collapse.

330
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:00,200
 I think that's the fur-- in my research,

331
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:03,300
 that's the first bridge that collapsed due to resonance.

332
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:04,300
 Really?

333
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:07,380
 And the military from then on were always

334
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:10,020
 told to break step when they cross over a bridge.

335
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:10,520
 Yeah.

336
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:11,820
 No one died in that one?

337
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:12,320
 Yeah.

338
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:12,820
 Right.

339
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:13,900
 But there was no clown involved.

340
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:14,940
 No clown involved.

341
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:18,500
 [INTERPOSING VOICES]

342
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:21,420
 Japanese games, I think is it Japanese Go?

343
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:23,900
 We talk about computers earlier on.

344
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:26,420
 In 2009, a survey of Go players guessed

345
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:29,420
 it would be 20 years before computers outsmarted them.

346
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:34,340
 And in 2019, the South Korean champion, Lee Seedol,

347
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:37,220
 retired after being beaten by AlphaGo, which

348
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:40,900
 was made by DeepMind, and basically said, that's it.

349
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:41,940
 We're beaten.

350
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:43,200
 Computers can beat us.

351
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:43,700
 That's it.

352
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:44,980
 No human can beat them.

353
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:47,380
 Because Go was interesting because things like chess

354
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:50,060
 is a lot of combinations that you can still

355
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:53,060
 search a reasonable space in terms

356
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:54,820
 of the number of possible future moves.

357
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:56,780
 Whereas Go is just an outrageous number

358
00:12:56,780 --> 00:12:57,980
 of possible combinations.

359
00:12:57,980 --> 00:13:01,940
 So you couldn't just throw brute force checking at it.

360
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:05,060
 You had to have some level of cleverness.

361
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:08,040
 And it might have been the same person who said,

362
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:11,540
 when you're looking at Go, it was like it was playing with either

363
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:13,220
 like creative or new strategies.

364
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:17,260
 Like it wasn't just doing things that had come before,

365
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:18,540
 it was actually playing the game.

366
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:19,940
 Yeah, absolutely.

367
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:23,340
 But good news humans, for you humans.

368
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:24,780
 Monopoly, they haven't cracked monopoly.

369
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:25,660
 No.

370
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:28,260
 In 2023 humans beat the best Go computer

371
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:30,820
 for the first time in seven years.

372
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:33,460
 But we were taught how to do it by another computer.

373
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:35,460
 OK.

374
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:38,100
 Basically, they set up another computer

375
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:41,540
 to try and look for weaknesses in the game.

376
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:45,580
 The computer found one and they told the human how to do it.

377
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:47,380
 And then the human beat the Go computer.

378
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:48,300
 OK, right.

379
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:49,940
 OK, get the computers on side.

380
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:52,500
 How do we know the computers are in cahoots?

381
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:55,740
 They're like, look, the humans need a win.

382
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:58,100
 They're going to get suspicious.

383
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:00,100
 They have, I don't know if I've said this before,

384
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:04,300
 but in Japan they have a museum of crashed trains basically.

385
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:07,980
 So you go in and you see the banged up in the metal

386
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:09,340
 and bent and all that stuff.

387
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:10,500
 It's not open to the public.

388
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,540
 It's purely for people who work in the industry

389
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:15,260
 to show them how important every decision is

390
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:16,620
 about what they do with safety.

391
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:17,780
 You don't want this to, yeah.

392
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:21,340
 It's just purely just like a morale booster for not fucking up.

393
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:23,740
 Oh, he's still working there.

394
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:25,140
 Let me show you something.

395
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:26,220
 This could be you.

396
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:29,260
 When my wife works, they still have bits of spacecraft

397
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:32,620
 that deorbitant from the Ariane 5 rocket exploded.

398
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:34,060
 And so they got in their coffee room.

399
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:36,180
 There's like these burnt bits of twisted metal.

400
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:37,780
 I'm like, that's someone's career.

401
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:40,020
 Yeah, that didn't make it into orbit.

402
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:41,540
 And she was in Tesco, doesn't she?

403
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:43,020
 Yeah, no, it's terrifying.

404
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:44,580
 It's so weird.

405
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:46,180
 Clean up in aisle three, please.

406
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:52,220
 When I was probably about, let's say,

407
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:54,780
 I guess 10, so about in the late 80s,

408
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:58,060
 my parents' school where they worked only had one computer.

409
00:14:58,060 --> 00:14:59,340
 And in the summer holidays,

410
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:00,860
 my parents were allowed to take it home

411
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:02,900
 and we were allowed to use it.

412
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:05,700
 And like learn how to program basic and stuff like that.

413
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:07,020
 Wow. It was really cool.

414
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:08,900
 It's like taking home a school hamster.

415
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:12,100
 Yeah, but we replaced it with a new one,

416
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:13,420
 the look kind of the same.

417
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:17,900
 You guys know the game of life?

418
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:18,860
 Yes.

419
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:21,540
 Do you know the super painful game of life?

420
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:25,300
 Which was released in September 2014 in Japan.

421
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:27,780
 And this was basically the same as the game of life,

422
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:30,700
 apart from there was loads of very, very stressful events

423
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:32,020
 all the way through it.

424
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:34,900
 So it wasn't just like get married, have a job,

425
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:38,100
 have kids and get to the end of the thing.

426
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:40,220
 There would be things like,

427
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:44,180
 you are busted for copying and pasting a letter of apology.

428
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:47,500
 Or your parents read your secret poem.

429
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:51,900
 And apparently it was like a bit more realistic

430
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:54,500
 because in Japanese society around then

431
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:55,500
 there was a lot of stress

432
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:57,500
 and they thought this was a realistic game of life.

433
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:58,500
 Nice.

434
00:15:58,500 --> 00:15:59,500
 Yeah.

435
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,700
 I mean, the super painful game of life

436
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:03,500
 does sound more like actual life.

437
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:04,940
 Managing expectations.

438
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:05,940
 Yeah.

439
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:09,340
 Tom Hanks has a song called Colin.

440
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:12,220
 Or Colin, whichever one you prepare.

441
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:16,140
 And yeah, he started a handkerchief business.

442
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:17,180
 And it's called Hanks.

443
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:18,180
 No.

444
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:19,180
 Yeah.

445
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:21,780
 And it started during the pandemic,

446
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:25,380
 beginning of the pandemic and it's shut now, unfortunately.

447
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:26,380
 2023.

448
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:28,900
 Someone wrote to him, which he responded to,

449
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:31,100
 saying, "Hankskerchiefs,

450
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:33,340
 have you ever thought of maybe changing the brand name

451
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:35,820
 to 'Colin Hankees'?"

452
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:37,580
 Which is a very nice one.

453
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:38,580
 Hold on, I don't get it.

454
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:39,580
 Was it like a colon?

455
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:40,980
 It was like a hanky for your bum.

456
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:41,980
 A colon hanky.

457
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:42,980
 Right.

458
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:44,180
 Wow, start this.

459
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:45,780
 It's not what you call your loo roll.

460
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:47,780
 Hunk.

461
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:49,380
 We need more colon hankies in here.

462
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:53,980
 Did he start this company because COVID had started

463
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:56,180
 and he thought, what are people going to need handkerchiefs?

464
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:59,380
 No, it was, I think it was in 2020 that he started it.

465
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:00,580
 It was definitely in that period.

466
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:03,580
 But it was, he loved handkerchiefs.

467
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:04,580
 He did it.

468
00:17:04,580 --> 00:17:07,780
 But then part of the profit or the royalties of Perperchus

469
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:10,780
 would go towards the, it was huge fires in America

470
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:13,380
 and it was to the charities that were helping out with that.

471
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:14,380
 The relief fund.

472
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:15,380
 That's nice.

473
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:16,380
 Does he love handkerchiefs?

474
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:21,380
 I mean, I've got a lot of questions about his love of handkerchiefs actually.

475
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:23,380
 Is that when someone called him masturbating once?

476
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:26,380
 I'm not masturbating, I just love handkerchiefs.

477
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:27,380
 I love handkerchiefs.

478
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:29,380
 So I'm having sex with the love of my life.

479
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:31,380
 Is that the argument?

480
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:35,380
 Yeah, I mean, is it related to that name?

481
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:37,380
 Has he said, "I love handkerchiefs because of my name?"

482
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:39,380
 Or was he like, "Oh, I've never thought."

483
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:40,380
 It was like, he's interviewed.

484
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:42,380
 He's like, "Gosh, I'd never thought about that connection."

485
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:43,380
 Yeah, first interview.

486
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:45,380
 Got a hanks.

487
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:46,380
 Yeah.

488
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:48,380
 I think you're so right.

489
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:51,380
 It's weird, isn't it, when you see a company name

490
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:54,380
 that you know contains a rude word

491
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:57,380
 and you can't not see the rude word.

492
00:17:57,380 --> 00:17:58,380
 So there are lots of examples.

493
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:01,380
 The Italian arm of Volkswagen.

494
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:03,380
 Well, can any of you guess?

495
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:05,380
 The Italian arm of Volkswagen.

496
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:06,380
 So it's Volkswagen.

497
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:07,380
 Yeah.

498
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:08,380
 Italia.

499
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:09,380
 Oh, yeah.

500
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:10,380
 Yeah.

501
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:12,380
 And you just look at Volkswagen Italia on Instagram,

502
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:13,380
 which is their handler.

503
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:14,380
 And it says Genitalia in it.

504
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:16,380
 And you can't, all you can see is the word genitalia.

505
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:19,380
 And you think, how did they not see that?

506
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:22,380
 And what's another good one?

507
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:24,380
 What was the famous one, which was Susan Boyle?

508
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:25,380
 Pen Island.

509
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:26,380
 Pen Island.

510
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:27,380
 Pen Island.

511
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:28,380
 Pen Island, either.

512
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:30,380
 It's Susan's album party.

513
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:32,380
 Susan's anal bum party.

514
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:38,380
 My mum's going to be so proud of me appearing on this podcast.

515
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:44,380
 Molestation nursery in New South Wales.

516
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:45,380
 Oh, man.

517
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:46,380
 It's still, just still open.

518
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:48,380
 I was actually reading some of the reviews.

519
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:49,380
 Oh, yeah.

520
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:50,380
 So it's obviously, if you look at the URL,

521
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:52,380
 it just says molestation nursery.

522
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:54,380
 Guys, it's genuinely taken me a while.

523
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:55,380
 Oh, you've got to see it, I think.

524
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:56,380
 You've got to see it.

525
00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:57,380
 Yeah, yeah.

526
00:18:57,380 --> 00:18:58,380
 I can't get it from the spoken.

527
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:00,380
 It's molestation nursery.

528
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:03,380
 And the reviews are all five stars except one.

529
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:04,380
 Wonderful family run business.

530
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:06,380
 When you think of it as a molestation nursery,

531
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:08,380
 the reviews become really funny.

532
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:10,380
 Fast, friendly and cost effective service.

533
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:12,380
 And there's just one four star review that says,

534
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:13,380
 I mean, it's good,

535
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:15,380
 but the website is called molestation nursery.

536
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:19,380
 I mean, you can also still just have nonsense as well.

537
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:22,380
 And the A, the AAAA thing is still going on.

538
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:23,380
 So on company's house,

539
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:26,380
 I spent a long time looking at company's house website.

540
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:30,380
 There are still two active companies with five A's

541
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:31,380
 at the beginning of their name.

542
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:32,380
 A, A, A, A, A.

543
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:35,380
 There were two recently dissolved companies.

544
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:38,380
 I found sextuple A aardvark.

545
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:40,380
 So it just looks like aardvark.

546
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:44,380
 And sextuple A, ABBA, and a septuple A,

547
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:46,380
 so seven A's, abracadabra.

548
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:48,380
 So I feel like at a certain point,

549
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:50,380
 it's a death of imagination in this game.

550
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:52,380
 At some point, the amount of money you make

551
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:54,380
 from having a name like that,

552
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:56,380
 you lose from the number of A's you have to buy

553
00:19:56,380 --> 00:19:58,380
 from the sign shop.

554
00:19:58,380 --> 00:20:04,380
 Search engine optimization is kind of what this is about.

555
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:07,380
 And it used to be so much easier.

556
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:10,380
 It must have been so fun in the '90s being a CODA,

557
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:13,380
 because basically the way you got to the top of a search engine

558
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:16,380
 was just how the search engine just counted

559
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:18,380
 the number of times you'd used a certain word on your sign.

560
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:21,380
 So people would build a website and let's say,

561
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:22,380
 I don't know, it was a hairdresser.

562
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:24,380
 I guess they just filled their website with the word "hair"

563
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:27,380
 and a hairdresser over and over again, millions of times.

564
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:28,380
 And you would quite often,

565
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:31,380
 you would put the word "hair" in like 500 times,

566
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:33,380
 but you'd make it the same colour as the background

567
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:36,380
 of your website so people couldn't read it.

568
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:38,380
 You didn't go on the website, just see the word "hair"

569
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:40,380
 a million times, but you would hide it

570
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:43,380
 so that the Google spiders could see it,

571
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:45,380
 but normal people couldn't see it.

572
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:46,380
 That's so clever.

573
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:49,380
 How students cheat with word counts as well

574
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:50,380
 when you have to upload it,

575
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:52,380
 and it automatically generates the word count.

576
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:53,380
 Did people do that?

577
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:54,380
 Really?

578
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:55,380
 No.

579
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:57,380
 I should have done that with my book.

580
00:20:57,380 --> 00:20:59,380
 If there's 80,000 words, there you go.

581
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:00,380
 Damn, it's three pages.

582
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:03,380
 There's software now that picks up that there's hidden text,

583
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:05,380
 but they just type in a load of rubbish

584
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:08,380
 and it looks like there's 300 or 400 extra words there,

585
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:09,380
 and just put it in white.

586
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:10,380
 It's the same thing.

587
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:11,380
 That's so funny.

588
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:12,380
 Wish I'd done it.

589
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:15,380
 Or if you've done too many words, you put it in as a picture.

590
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:18,380
 That's good, because actually that was always my problem.

591
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:19,380
 Damn it.

592
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:20,380
 Too many words.

593
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:21,380
 Yeah, and they were all shit.

594
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:22,380
 Too many words and all shit.

595
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:25,380
 It was often A star.

596
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:28,380
 For everybody, I think there's a lot of things

597
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:31,380
 that if you are a person who has not been pregnant,

598
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:33,380
 you would not expect.

599
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:36,380
 And I think the job of pregnant people is not to terrify everybody

600
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:39,380
 by telling you what they are, but I'm going to anyway.

601
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:45,380
 So one thing I didn't know is that your feet get bigger

602
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:47,380
 and it's permanent.

603
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:50,380
 Some women permanently go up a shoe size when they're pregnant.

604
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:52,380
 It's nuts, because we've had three kids

605
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:54,380
 and Fens and Clown shoes.

606
00:21:54,380 --> 00:22:00,380
 There was a guy in America that's how I found out about the story.

607
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:03,380
 He was trying to do 40 days of Lent entirely

608
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:06,380
 on what he calls liquid bread.

609
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:09,380
 And liquid bread is beer.

610
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:11,380
 And this is a thing that monks do.

611
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:14,380
 He read about monks having done this, where they basically brewed

612
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:18,380
 a really meaty, as it were, really packed beer

613
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:20,380
 that you felt so full after having,

614
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:22,380
 that it did feel like you were drinking it.

615
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:25,380
 The story goes, which I can't be properly verified,

616
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:28,380
 but the story goes is that they needed permission from the Pope

617
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:30,380
 in order for this to be approved.

618
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:32,380
 This is a few centuries ago.

619
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:33,380
 They took it all the way there,

620
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:35,380
 but the beer had spoiled on the way there.

621
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:37,380
 And so when the Pope took a sip of it,

622
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:39,380
 it was so disgusting or so rancid that he thought,

623
00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:45,380
 "Well, if anyone's willing to drink this, and yeah, okay, you can, fine."

624
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:46,380
 That's the story.

625
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:49,380
 And so there are monks that sort of drink liquid bread

626
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:51,380
 throughout Lent.

627
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:53,380
 Just sit and get pissed at their monasteries.

628
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:55,380
 It's like, "Super size me, but with beer."

629
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:57,380
 Yeah, exactly.

630
00:22:58,380 --> 00:23:02,380
 In the 19th century, there'd still be kind of rogue little denominations

631
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:04,380
 where they said, "Look, you can still eat these."

632
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:06,380
 Often probably by tradition.

633
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:09,380
 But they're Oli Worm in the 17th century.

634
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:13,380
 Yeah, Oli Worm, who's the son of Willem Worm.

635
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:14,380
 Wait a minute.

636
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:17,380
 Do you remember the very hungry caterpillar

637
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:20,380
 was originally called "A Week with Willie the Worm?"

638
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:21,380
 Oh, yeah, that's right.

639
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:22,380
 Is it based on this guy?

640
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:24,380
 Yeah, before it was a week with Willie the Worm,

641
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:26,380
 it was a week with Willem the Worm,

642
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:28,380
 because it was just debating liturgy.

643
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:30,380
 Because he was a religious guy.

644
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:32,380
 No, Oli Worm, who's probably actually called Oli Worm,

645
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:34,380
 said that an ordinance had been passed

646
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:36,380
 classing them as fish.

647
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:38,380
 And he said as soon as that ordinance passed,

648
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:41,380
 suddenly, because these geese were hanging out in France a lot,

649
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:43,380
 exports from France to England and Scotland soared,

650
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:45,380
 because the English and the Scots during Lent

651
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:49,380
 were just desperate for something better than kind of shit, salted fish.

652
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:52,380
 And Oli Worm is actually a sort of QI favourite,

653
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:56,380
 because he also debunked the idea that unicorns exist.

654
00:23:56,380 --> 00:23:59,380
 He was the one who said they're actually just gnawls.

655
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:01,380
 And he was the one who told us

656
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:03,380
 Lemmings aren't spontaneously generated by air.

657
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:04,380
 Oh, cool.

658
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:05,380
 Oh, wow.

659
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:07,380
 He was like an anti-pliny.

660
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:08,380
 He's the anti-pliny.

661
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:10,380
 Yeah, wow.

662
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:14,380
 You know the story about how a dad furiously went into Target,

663
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:18,380
 because he said, "Why are you recommending pregnancy stuff

664
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:20,380
 to my child who's a high schooler?"

665
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:22,380
 Sorry, Target is a...

666
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:25,380
 Target's a big store in the America,

667
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:28,380
 which is one of those stores where you can get everything you can get.

668
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:29,380
 Like a Walmart?

669
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:30,380
 Yeah, exactly.

670
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:31,380
 For other Americans?

671
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:33,380
 Yeah, exactly.

672
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:35,380
 So the story is that the dad comes in and he's like,

673
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:37,380
 "What are you doing sending emails to my daughter

674
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:39,380
 recommending pregnancy stuff?"

675
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:41,380
 And then it turns out she was pregnant.

676
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:43,380
 And he wrote back apologizing saying,

677
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:46,380
 "You know, I guess things are going on in my house."

678
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:49,380
 I didn't fully realise, but she was pregnant.

679
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:52,380
 And it's all to do with the fact that they have at Target

680
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:56,380
 people who analyse all of the purchases that everyone has.

681
00:24:56,380 --> 00:24:59,380
 For example, they would notice that lots of people who were on the baby registry

682
00:24:59,380 --> 00:25:02,380
 were buying larger quantities of unscented lotion

683
00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:04,380
 around the beginning of their second trimester.

684
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:07,380
 And so they thought if we can get in early and be the first people

685
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:11,380
 to give them sort of discounts and stuff towards pregnancy stuff,

686
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:13,380
 they would stay with us forever on.

687
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:14,380
 They would buy their diapers from us,

688
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:16,380
 because what they discovered was in later trimesters,

689
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:18,380
 you suddenly just, all your hormones and everything

690
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:20,380
 means that you lose brand association,

691
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:22,380
 so you'll go somewhere else.

692
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:25,380
 This is according to them.

693
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:27,380
 Absolutely bullshit.

694
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:29,380
 I did notice, Anna, when you were pregnant,

695
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:32,380
 you started coming in and like owned brand trainers.

696
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:35,380
 And you were the only, like, as the shreddies.

697
00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:38,380
 It was so hard. I'd find myself in Sainsbury.

698
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:41,380
 I was like, "What? I thought I was a Tesco girl."

699
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:42,380
 There's something wrong with my,

700
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:44,380
 "I can no longer taste the difference."

701
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:47,380
 I don't know what it is.

702
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:49,380
 One more quiz.

703
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:52,380
 In Poland, did you read about how a few years ago

704
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:54,380
 they cancelled a certain bus that was on the way

705
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:56,380
 to a place in Poland called Hell?

706
00:25:56,380 --> 00:25:58,380
 Okay, so 666.

707
00:25:58,380 --> 00:26:01,380
 It was a 666, and they genuinely cancelled it,

708
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:03,380
 because they had so many Catholic complaints.

709
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:07,380
 Obviously Poland has a strong Catholic contingent.

710
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:09,380
 And on a Catholic website in 2018,

711
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:12,380
 they wrote the 666 bus line running to Hell

712
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:14,380
 to put it briefly and bluntly,

713
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:16,380
 undermines the Christian order of the Polish state

714
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:18,380
 and its foundations.

715
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:21,380
 It's just the tip of the iceberg of a much greater problem.

716
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:23,380
 Wow. When was this?

717
00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:25,380
 That was 2018, and they've just cancelled it,

718
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:26,380
 or they cancelled it last year,

719
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:28,380
 or changed the number to 669, I think.

720
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:29,380
 Do you rate council at mid?

721
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:31,380
 69 mid-year.

722
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:34,380
 Oh, no, wait till this Catholic website is that,

723
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:35,380
 and realises...

724
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:37,380
 The devil's 69.

725
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:43,380
 In ancient Rome, there was a whole thing about foreplay,

726
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:45,380
 particularly Cunny Lingus being seen as something

727
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:47,380
 that you just wouldn't do.

728
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:49,380
 So a man to a woman would be like,

729
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:51,380
 "Oh, you would get teased for it

730
00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:53,380
 if it was found out that you had done that."

731
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:55,380
 But there's an idea that in Pompeii,

732
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:57,380
 because how annoying is that,

733
00:26:57,380 --> 00:26:59,380
 because that's a nice sexual pleasure for a lot of people,

734
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:01,380
 you would actually hire male sex workers,

735
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:03,380
 specifically to do that.

736
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:05,380
 So there's graffiti that they found in Pompeii

737
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:07,380
 as part of the surviving...

738
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:09,380
 I thought you were going to say they found the people,

739
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:11,380
 because they were all in positions to be off the fight,

740
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:13,380
 and then put in a museum.

741
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:15,380
 You see the dust cloud coming,

742
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:17,380
 and you're like, "Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no!"

743
00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:20,380
 "I told you I made you, and you will finish."

744
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:24,380
 You might as well go out doing what you love.

745
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:26,380
 Exactly.

746
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:30,380
 In 2014, there was a dispute between a pig farm in Yorkshire

747
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:32,380
 and a Wiltshire ballooning company,

748
00:27:32,380 --> 00:27:35,380
 because a hot-air balloon flew too near to a pig farm

749
00:27:35,380 --> 00:27:37,380
 and scared the pigs, and they all piled into a ditch

750
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:39,380
 and various of them had...

751
00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:41,380
 I know, yeah, and like I said, then...

752
00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:43,380
 Such a funny image.

753
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:45,380
 No, it's not funny, which is very bad,

754
00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:47,380
 because they very easy have heart attacks, stuff like that.

755
00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:49,380
 Some are heart attacks, some are miscarriages.

756
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:51,380
 But it was very interesting,

757
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:53,380
 because the person who managed to get compensation

758
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:55,380
 for the pig farmer was a mathematician,

759
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:57,380
 who was employed from the University of York,

760
00:27:57,380 --> 00:28:00,380
 Professor of Maths, because the hot-air balloon company said,

761
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:03,380
 "We were told to stay X number of metres,

762
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:05,380
 I think it was 500 metres away at least,

763
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:08,380
 and we were at least 750 metres away from your farm."

764
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:11,380
 He said, "You're way closer than that. You scared the pigs."

765
00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:15,380
 Now, his wife took a photo of the balloon in the air,

766
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:17,380
 so you can see the size of the balloon,

767
00:28:17,380 --> 00:28:19,380
 you can see some trees underneath,

768
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:21,380
 and they employed a Professor of Maths at the University of York

769
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:23,380
 to deploy some trigonometry,

770
00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:25,380
 basically looking at the width of the balloon

771
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:27,380
 and then the distance from the trees,

772
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:29,380
 and then where the trees were in relation to the farm

773
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:31,380
 to figure out exactly how far away the balloon was.

774
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:32,380
 Forensics.

775
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:34,380
 And prove that it was indeed closer.

776
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:37,380
 That is good. I mean, no use for the pigs,

777
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:38,380
 because they're already gone.

778
00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:39,380
 No use for the pigs.

779
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:40,380
 Before you didn't get any compensation, yeah.

780
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:42,380
 No, but that's interesting,

781
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:44,380
 because I've been in the hot-air balloon relatively recently,

782
00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:45,380
 and you can't steer them.

783
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:47,380
 You have to go where the wind takes you.

784
00:28:47,380 --> 00:28:48,380
 You go up or down,

785
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:50,380
 and then you know which directions the winds are going

786
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:51,380
 at different heights, right?

787
00:28:51,380 --> 00:28:52,380
 I suppose so.

788
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:53,380
 So, if you're near the pigs,

789
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:56,380
 you go upwards so that you're not too close.

790
00:28:56,380 --> 00:28:57,380
 Yeah, we'll go down.

791
00:28:57,380 --> 00:28:58,380
 If you're near the pigs, yeah.

792
00:28:58,380 --> 00:29:01,380
 But like, in terms of generally steering balloons in directions,

793
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:03,380
 it's not massively controllable,

794
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:04,380
 but the idea is that there are different air flows

795
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:05,380
 at different heights,

796
00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:06,380
 so you can go up and down,

797
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:07,380
 and then you can go in different directions

798
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:08,380
 based on how high you are, I think.

799
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:10,380
 Do we know the circumstances of the...

800
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:12,380
 Balloons, obviously, quite difficult to control,

801
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:14,380
 but you can't just say,

802
00:29:14,380 --> 00:29:15,380
 "I can't control my balloon at all."

803
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:16,380
 So, bloody, go to the side of your house.

804
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:17,380
 You can go up and down.

805
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:18,380
 Yeah, you can go up and down.

806
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:20,380
 If you want to stay away from the pigs, you go up.

807
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:21,380
 Like, that's pretty easy.

808
00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:22,380
 Because the pigs can't fly.

809
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:26,380
 The origin of "Porky Pig"

810
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:29,380
 he was based on or inspired by a staple character

811
00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:31,380
 from traditional Italian comedy,

812
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:32,380
 the Comedia dell'arte.

813
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:33,380
 What was it?

814
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:34,380
 Yeah, so like,

815
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:36,380
 from between like the 16th to 18th centuries,

816
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:38,380
 there was this traditional theatre comedy,

817
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:41,380
 and it used all of these staple comedy characters.

818
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:42,380
 Like the Harlequin.

819
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:43,380
 The Harlequin was one, which is the servant.

820
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:44,380
 I've got a whole list of them here,

821
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:46,380
 like the El Capitano,

822
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:50,380
 which is the indigent loner,

823
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:52,380
 and the Pantalone, the Older Wealth and that.

824
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:54,380
 From where we get Pantaloons, right?

825
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:55,380
 Exactly, yeah, exactly.

826
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:57,380
 Sorry, can I just ask that word that you said?

827
00:29:57,380 --> 00:29:58,380
 Indigent.

828
00:29:58,380 --> 00:29:59,380
 I don't know that word.

829
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:00,380
 It means like stupid, I think.

830
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:01,380
 Does it?

831
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:02,380
 Oh, I think it means like poverty stricken

832
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:04,380
 and like in a bad state.

833
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:05,380
 Thank you.

834
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:09,380
 All right, Jacob, I'll respond.

835
00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:12,380
 I don't know if,

836
00:30:12,380 --> 00:30:14,380
 because I didn't look into blank for this fact,

837
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:16,380
 but presumably we've said the thing about

838
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:18,380
 that he was in a coma when he was dying,

839
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:20,380
 and the only way they managed to communicate

840
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:23,380
 through to him was by talking to him as Bugs Bunny.

841
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:24,380
 I think that was before he died.

842
00:30:24,380 --> 00:30:26,380
 I think he was in a car crash when he was younger.

843
00:30:26,380 --> 00:30:28,380
 Oh, it definitely all happened before he died, yeah.

844
00:30:28,380 --> 00:30:32,380
 The coma that he was in was not the one

845
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:34,380
 being a seance as Bugs Bunny.

846
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:36,380
 Yeah, that was it, wasn't it?

847
00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:37,380
 The doctor came in,

848
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:38,380
 like everyone had tried to say,

849
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:40,380
 "Mel, Mel, are you okay? Are you okay?"

850
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:41,380
 And he wouldn't respond,

851
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:43,380
 and then the doctor came in and said,

852
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:45,380
 "Hey, Bugs, are you okay?"

853
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:46,380
 Well, somebody said, "What's up, Doc?"

854
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:48,380
 And the doc was like, "I'm all right."

855
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:51,380
 And they made him work from his hospital bed, didn't they?

856
00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:53,380
 After he'd had this incredibly dramatic car crash

857
00:30:53,380 --> 00:30:55,380
 where he was in a coma for weeks,

858
00:30:55,380 --> 00:30:57,380
 and he was in the middle of filming the Flintstones,

859
00:30:57,380 --> 00:30:59,380
 I think, was he Barney?

860
00:30:59,380 --> 00:31:00,380
 Yeah.

861
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:01,380
 And yeah, he was filming that,

862
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:04,380
 and they replaced his voice for a few episodes,

863
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:06,380
 so you can find some Flintstones episodes

864
00:31:06,380 --> 00:31:08,380
 where, you know, there's this rogue guy,

865
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:10,380
 and then they shipped a bunch of audio equipment

866
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:12,380
 into his kind of hospital bed,

867
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:14,380
 and made him record from there.

868
00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:15,380
 Although I suppose it's only talking, isn't it?

869
00:31:15,380 --> 00:31:16,380
 Oh, can it be?

870
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:22,380
 So, this is about people who live in Papua New Guinea.

871
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:24,380
 In Papua New Guinea, in particular groups.

872
00:31:24,380 --> 00:31:26,380
 So, Dan.

873
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:27,380
 Yeah.

874
00:31:27,380 --> 00:31:28,380
 You have got 100 pounds.

875
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:29,380
 Okay.

876
00:31:29,380 --> 00:31:30,380
 Okay.

877
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:32,380
 You're going to give Alex 100 pounds.

878
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:33,380
 Yeah.

879
00:31:33,380 --> 00:31:34,380
 But there is one condition.

880
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:37,380
 Alex has to share the 100 pounds with Anna.

881
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:40,380
 He can decide how much of the 100 he's going to keep.

882
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:42,380
 It could be you have 99 pounds, 99,

883
00:31:42,380 --> 00:31:43,380
 and Anna gets 1p.

884
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:44,380
 That is what will happen.

885
00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:47,380
 But Anna has to agree to the deal,

886
00:31:47,380 --> 00:31:48,380
 otherwise you both get nothing.

887
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:49,380
 Okay.

888
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:51,380
 So it's always like a slight prison of delimory type thing.

889
00:31:51,380 --> 00:31:52,380
 Similar.

890
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:55,380
 So how much are you going to Alex offer of Dan's money

891
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:56,380
 to give to Anna?

892
00:31:56,380 --> 00:31:58,380
 I'm going to offer her less than half.

893
00:31:58,380 --> 00:32:01,380
 But also you could offer her as little as possible.

894
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:02,380
 Does she know how much I'm guessing?

895
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:03,380
 Anna knows the whole deal.

896
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:04,380
 Okay, fine.

897
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:06,380
 So the whole thing is working out whether Anna is spiteful enough

898
00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:09,380
 to say, "No, I won't allow this deal to happen."

899
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:12,380
 Because if I did give her 5 quid, she's up on it 5 quid.

900
00:32:12,380 --> 00:32:13,380
 You've explained the logic.

901
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:15,380
 And Anna is a horrible spiteful person.

902
00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:18,380
 So I don't think it's going to get anything less than like 90/10.

903
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:19,380
 I think I'm going to end it with a 10.

904
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:20,380
 So how much are you going to offer?

905
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:23,380
 I'm going to offer her 30 pounds.

906
00:32:23,380 --> 00:32:24,380
 And I take Q70.

907
00:32:24,380 --> 00:32:25,380
 Anna, are you going to accept?

908
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:26,380
 I would have taken 1p.

909
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:31,380
 Greed over spite for me any day.

910
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:32,380
 I don't care about fairness.

911
00:32:32,380 --> 00:32:35,380
 Well, the truth is that in general people tend to refuse the money

912
00:32:35,380 --> 00:32:38,380
 if they offer any lower than 25 pounds.

913
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:40,380
 Not out of spite so much as they think,

914
00:32:40,380 --> 00:32:42,380
 "Well, why should I let you have anything?

915
00:32:42,380 --> 00:32:43,380
 You're being an asshole."

916
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:45,380
 And I think I say 30 is kind of around that mark of, yeah.

917
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:47,380
 Yeah, so yeah, I think you pretty much nailed it.

918
00:32:47,380 --> 00:32:50,380
 But among some groups in Papua New Guinea,

919
00:32:50,380 --> 00:32:52,380
 particularly the Au and the Ganau,

920
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:56,380
 when people are offered above 50%, they're rejected.

921
00:32:56,380 --> 00:32:58,380
 And that is because in these cultures,

922
00:32:58,380 --> 00:33:01,380
 you get high status by giving people gifts.

923
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:04,380
 And so if I give you more than 50%,

924
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:07,380
 actually I'm saying I am now a higher status than you.

925
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:08,380
 And if you accept it,

926
00:33:08,380 --> 00:33:10,380
 you're accepting that you're a lower status.

927
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:12,380
 So if you offered Anna 70 quid, she would say,

928
00:33:12,380 --> 00:33:14,380
 "Well, no, I'm way better than you.

929
00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:16,380
 Why would I accept that much?"

930
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:19,380
 I wouldn't, once again, because all I care about is the money.

931
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:21,380
 None of these weird cultural hang-ups.

932
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:25,380
 So there is this culture in Cambridge, which is very odd.

933
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:32,380
 Do you guys know where you would find the world's longest bus?

934
00:33:32,380 --> 00:33:33,380
 World's longest bus.

935
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:34,380
 I'll give you a clue.

936
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:35,380
 Yeah.

937
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:37,380
 There are 193 countries in the world,

938
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:40,380
 and it would probably be in the last five you would guess.

939
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:41,380
 Okay, Antarctica.

940
00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:42,380
 Like the Alphabet.

941
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:43,380
 That's not a country, okay?

942
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:44,380
 Okay, fine.

943
00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:46,380
 Although the Vatican, no.

944
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:48,380
 And it takes up the whole of the Vatican,

945
00:33:48,380 --> 00:33:49,380
 one into the other.

946
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:50,380
 Luxembourg.

947
00:33:50,380 --> 00:33:51,380
 No.

948
00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:52,380
 We're just naming countries now.

949
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:53,380
 Yeah, I think that's good.

950
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:54,380
 What did you expect in this game?

951
00:33:54,380 --> 00:33:57,380
 You set the premise.

952
00:33:57,380 --> 00:34:00,380
 This is why my quiz shows never go anywhere.

953
00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:03,380
 It is the Democratic Republic of Congo.

954
00:34:03,380 --> 00:34:04,380
 Oh, wow.

955
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:05,380
 World's longest bus.

956
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:06,380
 How long?

957
00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:07,380
 Because of the Congo thing.

958
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:08,380
 And that's Congo.

959
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:13,380
 Do you think other buses are creeping up behind it?

960
00:34:13,380 --> 00:34:14,380
 Yeah.

961
00:34:14,380 --> 00:34:18,380
 If they're all bendy as well,

962
00:34:18,380 --> 00:34:19,380
 they can go left, right, left, right.

963
00:34:19,380 --> 00:34:20,380
 Exactly.

964
00:34:20,380 --> 00:34:21,380
 You were a terrible one.

965
00:34:21,380 --> 00:34:23,380
 You went to Kinshasa that time.

966
00:34:23,380 --> 00:34:25,380
 You just walked behind everyone in the street,

967
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:26,380
 just going...

968
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:29,380
 So how long is it?

969
00:34:29,380 --> 00:34:30,380
 How long is it?

970
00:34:30,380 --> 00:34:33,380
 Well, three times the length of a London bus.

971
00:34:33,380 --> 00:34:34,380
 Okay.

972
00:34:34,380 --> 00:34:36,380
 It could carry 350 passengers comfortably.

973
00:34:36,380 --> 00:34:38,380
 This is the most appropriate use of a London bus

974
00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:40,380
 for length comparison that I've ever heard.

975
00:34:40,380 --> 00:34:41,380
 Yes.

976
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:43,380
 I always say like...

977
00:34:43,380 --> 00:34:46,380
 Usually they say like, "Oh, the line is so long."

978
00:34:46,380 --> 00:34:47,380
 This dinosaur.

979
00:34:47,380 --> 00:34:48,380
 I don't know how long that is.

980
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:49,380
 Yeah.

981
00:34:49,380 --> 00:34:52,380
 So it was 32.2 meters long.

982
00:34:52,380 --> 00:34:54,380
 How did it go around the corners?

983
00:34:54,380 --> 00:34:56,380
 I think a good question.

984
00:34:56,380 --> 00:34:57,380
 I thought the same.

985
00:34:57,380 --> 00:34:58,380
 Perhaps not so many corners

986
00:34:58,380 --> 00:35:01,380
 when you're going from one town to another.

987
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:02,380
 Okay.

988
00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:04,380
 But how do you turn around must have been a nightmare.

989
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:05,380
 Yeah, no, absolutely.

990
00:35:05,380 --> 00:35:06,380
 And was it the same...

991
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:08,380
 Sorry, was it the same dimensions as a bus otherwise?

992
00:35:08,380 --> 00:35:10,380
 Was it enormous or was it just really, really long?

993
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:12,380
 Imagine, you know those...

994
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:13,380
 Do you know Optimus Prime?

995
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:14,380
 Yeah.

996
00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:15,380
 Yes.

997
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:17,380
 He's like a truck, right?

998
00:35:17,380 --> 00:35:18,380
 His head is a truck.

999
00:35:18,380 --> 00:35:19,380
 Right.

1000
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:20,380
 Where is this going?

1001
00:35:20,380 --> 00:35:22,380
 I can't remember what they're actually called,

1002
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:23,380
 but you know where it's like...

1003
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:24,380
 Transformers.

1004
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:25,380
 No, no, no.

1005
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:27,380
 The type of truck where it's like a bottom...

1006
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:28,380
 Articulated lorry thing.

1007
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:29,380
 That's it.

1008
00:35:29,380 --> 00:35:30,380
 It's like an articulated lorry,

1009
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:32,380
 but then it's got almost three bendy buses

1010
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:34,380
 at the back of it.

1011
00:35:34,380 --> 00:35:35,380
 Right.

1012
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:36,380
 Oh, so it's like a train?

1013
00:35:36,380 --> 00:35:37,380
 Yeah.

1014
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:38,380
 I mean, it's like a bus.

1015
00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:39,380
 Yeah.

1016
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:40,380
 It's like a bus train lorry.

1017
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:42,380
 What is a train with a bus on rails?

1018
00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:45,380
 It's like a bus train lorry, Optimus Prime combo.

1019
00:35:45,380 --> 00:35:46,380
 It sounds amazing.

1020
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:47,380
 It just sounds completely unworkable.

1021
00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:48,380
 How long did it last?

1022
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:51,380
 It was in use from 1989 to 2013.

1023
00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:52,380
 Oh, quite a long time then.

1024
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:53,380
 Okay.

1025
00:35:53,380 --> 00:35:54,380
 Yeah, relatively long.

1026
00:35:54,380 --> 00:35:55,380
 But yeah.

1027
00:35:55,380 --> 00:35:56,380
 I guess it's interesting like that.

1028
00:35:56,380 --> 00:35:57,380
 It's the whole point of trains, right?

1029
00:35:57,380 --> 00:35:59,380
 It's like high capacity things,

1030
00:35:59,380 --> 00:36:01,380
 like rather than lots of little ones,

1031
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:02,380
 you have one big one.

1032
00:36:02,380 --> 00:36:04,380
 Yeah, it makes sense to make it as big as you can.

1033
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:05,380
 Yeah.

1034
00:36:05,380 --> 00:36:06,380
 I'm almost surprised that it's only that big.

1035
00:36:06,380 --> 00:36:08,380
 I would say Guinness set up a competition

1036
00:36:08,380 --> 00:36:10,380
 for the longest bus in the world,

1037
00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:11,380
 because it's very easy to beat.

1038
00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:13,380
 Only three times the length of a London bus.

1039
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:14,380
 So it's only one point five times the length

1040
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:15,380
 of one of those bendy buses.

1041
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:16,380
 Yeah.

1042
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:17,380
 They were completely...

1043
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:19,380
 It's only half the length of a Diplodocus.

1044
00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:23,380
 In the end series,

1045
00:36:23,380 --> 00:36:27,380
 I started thinking that sign-off of QI

1046
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:30,380
 was going to be neolithic newspaper nuggets

1047
00:36:30,380 --> 00:36:32,380
 from the collection that I started

1048
00:36:32,380 --> 00:36:34,380
 when I began the news quiz in the '70s.

1049
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:36,380
 Does that count as a neolithic?

1050
00:36:36,380 --> 00:36:39,380
 Well, no, because I've got two

1051
00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:41,380
 on people burning houses down.

1052
00:36:41,380 --> 00:36:42,380
 Oh, wow.

1053
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:44,380
 That happen to be neolithic nuggets.

1054
00:36:44,380 --> 00:36:46,380
 Sorry, you're bringing some research to the table

1055
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:47,380
 that is from the 1970s?

1056
00:36:47,380 --> 00:36:48,380
 Yes.

1057
00:36:48,380 --> 00:36:50,380
 That's incredible.

1058
00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:51,380
 And it is.

1059
00:36:51,380 --> 00:36:53,380
 This one's from the Baltimore Sun.

1060
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:56,380
 Andrew Schwartz, age 14 of Washington, D.C.,

1061
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:58,380
 used to spend his time setting off fire alarms,

1062
00:36:58,380 --> 00:37:00,380
 but he underwent psychiatric treatment

1063
00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:03,380
 to cure him of this, and he stopped doing it.

1064
00:37:03,380 --> 00:37:05,380
 He learned that he should never break the glass

1065
00:37:05,380 --> 00:37:08,380
 and press the button unless there actually was a fire.

1066
00:37:08,380 --> 00:37:11,380
 So now he sets the houses on fire first

1067
00:37:11,380 --> 00:37:13,380
 and has done so four times.

1068
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:17,380
 And this other one from the Bangkok Post.

1069
00:37:17,380 --> 00:37:20,380
 Commenting on a complaint from Mr Arthur Purdy

1070
00:37:20,380 --> 00:37:24,380
 about a large gas bill, a spokesman for Northwest Gas said,

1071
00:37:24,380 --> 00:37:27,380
 "We agree it was rather high for the time of year.

1072
00:37:27,380 --> 00:37:30,380
 It's possible Mr Purdy has been charged for the gas

1073
00:37:30,380 --> 00:37:34,380
 used up during the explosion that blew his house to pieces."

1074
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:37,380
 (LAUGHTER)

1075
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:38,380
 Wow.

1076
00:37:38,380 --> 00:37:41,380
 Imagine if James now cuts that from the show.

1077
00:37:41,380 --> 00:37:45,380
 50 years of waiting for this research to finally be revealed.

1078
00:37:45,380 --> 00:37:46,380
 There you go.

1079
00:37:46,380 --> 00:37:48,380
 There is all of our outtakes.

1080
00:37:48,380 --> 00:37:49,380
 Thanks everyone for listening.

1081
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:51,380
 Just one more reminder before you switch off.

1082
00:37:51,380 --> 00:37:55,380
 If you do want to come see us live on stage doing our new tour,

1083
00:37:55,380 --> 00:37:57,380
 Thundernerds, you can do that.

1084
00:37:57,380 --> 00:38:00,380
 And you, as a clubfish member, will get pre-sale access

1085
00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:04,380
 three days before general sale on the 14th of May.

1086
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:06,380
 So get in on the 14th of May

1087
00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:08,380
 and all you need to do is head to...

1088
00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:12,380
 No such thing as a fish.com/fishtour.

1089
00:38:12,380 --> 00:38:14,380
 And then when you're through to the booking website

1090
00:38:14,380 --> 00:38:18,380
 and you click to book your tickets, type in the code FISHTOUR.

1091
00:38:18,380 --> 00:38:19,380
 All right.

1092
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:20,380
 Don't tell anyone.

1093
00:38:20,380 --> 00:38:22,380
 Don't tell the non-believers of the clubfish.

1094
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:24,380
 It's our little secret.

1095
00:38:24,380 --> 00:38:25,380
 All right. See you all later.

1096
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:28,380
 We'll catch you again in a couple of weeks with another bonus episode.

1097
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:29,380
 And until then,

1098
00:38:29,380 --> 00:38:33,380
 we will be back on the main feed with another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish

1099
00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:34,380
 on a regular Friday.

1100
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:35,380
 See you then.

1101
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:40,380
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

1102
00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:44,380
 [MUSIC ENDS]

00:38:44,380 --> 00:38:53,380
