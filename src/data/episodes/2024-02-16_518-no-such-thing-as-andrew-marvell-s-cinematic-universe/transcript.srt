1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:16,440
 - Hello and welcome to another episode

3
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:19,240
 of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast

4
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:22,160
 coming to you from the QI offices in Hoburn.

5
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:23,360
 My name is Dan Shriver.

6
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:25,520
 I am sitting here with Andrew Hunter Murray,

7
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:27,680
 James Harkin and Anna Tyshinski.

8
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:29,780
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones

9
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:32,480
 of our four favorite facts from the last seven days.

10
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:35,520
 And in a particular order, here we go.

11
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,780
 Starting with fact number one, and that is Anna.

12
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:42,040
 - My fact this week is that shortly after writing an essay

13
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:45,120
 on why writers shouldn't publish anonymously,

14
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,880
 Anthony Trollett published a book anonymously.

15
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:52,260
 - Oh, it's called out a mere 130 years from later.

16
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:53,560
 (laughing)

17
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:56,120
 - Not a moment too soon.

18
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:58,120
 I've just sort of inherited from a friend

19
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:00,040
 who decided he was never gonna read them,

20
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:01,920
 the complete works of Anthony Trollett.

21
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,080
 And he's giving them to me in bits

22
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:04,920
 and he seems to have given me

23
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:06,680
 the three least known Anthony Trollett.

24
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:11,440
 So this is an introduction to Nina Bellatka, which was...

25
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:13,160
 - If you wanna get into Trollett,

26
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:15,520
 I would say probably don't start with that one.

27
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:18,360
 - It's not an entry level, no, no.

28
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:21,440
 Anyway, this fact, Nina Bellatka in the introduction,

29
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:24,880
 it just mentioned that he wrote an essay in 1865

30
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:28,360
 and he said a man should always dare to be responsible

31
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:29,480
 for the work which he does

32
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:32,240
 and should be ready to accept the shame, rebuffs, ridicule,

33
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,440
 or the indifference which will attend bad work.

34
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:36,580
 And it's all about how, you know,

35
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:37,960
 put your name to something

36
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:41,000
 and then he didn't put his name to Nina Bellatka and...

37
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,720
 - I do have some sympathy, but if your name is A Trollop

38
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:45,760
 that you don't wanna put it on every big video.

39
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:47,480
 (laughing)

40
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:48,440
 - Who here has read Trollop?

41
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:50,720
 - I've read the start of Barchester Towers.

42
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:51,560
 - Okay.

43
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:52,760
 - Did you read it in preparation for this book?

44
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:55,080
 - I certainly did. (laughing)

45
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:56,760
 - Read the first 50 pages.

46
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:57,600
 - Nice.

47
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,160
 - Like I've done quite a lot of books over the years

48
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,520
 just because of this podcast.

49
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:01,360
 - Yeah.

50
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,240
 - Just kind of started reading, got an idea and gone,

51
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:04,360
 well, I think I've got an idea

52
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:06,040
 of this guy's entire earth right now.

53
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,440
 - How have you got to the end?

54
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:08,920
 You don't know about the robots in it.

55
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:10,240
 - What?

56
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:12,360
 So Anna's read some Trollop, Andy, you must have done.

57
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:14,760
 - I'm actually a Trollop virgin.

58
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,680
 - Honestly, I said to my wife last night

59
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:19,240
 that if anyone likes Anthony Trollop,

60
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,560
 Andy would like Anthony Trollop.

61
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:24,280
 - Is it because he writes about ecclesiastical

62
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:26,120
 matters in the 19th century?

63
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:26,960
 - Yeah.

64
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:27,800
 - Yeah.

65
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:28,640
 - I think I will.

66
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:29,480
 - It's right up your street.

67
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:30,320
 - I don't know if it is.

68
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,160
 I think that's a missed call on Andy.

69
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:32,000
 - You think?

70
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:32,840
 - Yeah, I do.

71
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:35,040
 I think I slightly prefer that kind of literature.

72
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,080
 - It feels like it's in between what you would like.

73
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:40,120
 It feels to me like it's halfway between Dickens

74
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,560
 and Jane Austen.

75
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,240
 - It is, but the thing about Anthony Trollop,

76
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:46,520
 he's not as widely read as I think he should be.

77
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:48,120
 He's frowned on in a lot of circles

78
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,760
 because he was just a machine.

79
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:50,600
 - Yeah.

80
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,000
 - Of output, wasn't he?

81
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,320
 47 novels, loads of stories.

82
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:56,680
 His routine was getting up every morning,

83
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:59,400
 5.30, writing for three solid hours.

84
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,120
 He put a watch in front of him,

85
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,480
 made himself write 250 words every 15 minutes,

86
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:05,960
 and he didn't have word counts that time.

87
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:08,160
 So he must have incorporated counting the words.

88
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,600
 - He must have counted the pages

89
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,440
 'cause he just had so much stuff.

90
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:12,280
 - I love it.

91
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:13,880
 I think that's exactly how I would write

92
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:15,240
 if I was writing novels.

93
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:17,120
 - I actually thought reading about him,

94
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,600
 and this is not a negative thing at all.

95
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:21,040
 I thought there's quite a lot of you in him.

96
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,880
 - He's quite annoying.

97
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:24,280
 We all write books.

98
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:27,400
 As someone who, you know, footles around a bit,

99
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,440
 toys with the margins.

100
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,920
 As you know, and you just see,

101
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:33,400
 in the time you've spent footling around with the margins,

102
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:37,240
 Anthony Trollop will have written 16 pages in prose.

103
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,320
 He had a portable desk made.

104
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,160
 I love this.

105
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:40,440
 So he could write on trains.

106
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:42,400
 And if he was going on board a ship,

107
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,720
 he would meet up with the ship's carpenter

108
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,560
 to arrange proper writing conditions.

109
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,000
 - That's pretty ritzy.

110
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:49,840
 - Wow.

111
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:50,680
 - That's cool.

112
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:52,120
 - But the reason he had to do it was 'cause he was,

113
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:54,040
 and I'm simplifying here, postman.

114
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:55,480
 (all laughing)

115
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:57,160
 You are simplifying.

116
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:58,000
 But he wrote in the morning

117
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,400
 'cause he had a full-time job at the post office

118
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,840
 for about, what, how long was this?

119
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:01,680
 Decades.

120
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:02,520
 - Yeah.

121
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,360
 - And he was quite 60s.

122
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,200
 - He was really senior.

123
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,040
 He was really senior in the post office.

124
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,280
 - Yeah, what if you worked there that long?

125
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,440
 - And it's that really cool fact,

126
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:09,120
 which is the only thing I knew about him,

127
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,120
 which is that he's basically responsible

128
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:14,200
 for the reason that we have post boxes all over the UK.

129
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,680
 Possibly he's spotted in in France.

130
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,720
 I don't think he ever claimed that he invented it,

131
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,760
 but he certainly recommended it to the government.

132
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,920
 And they used to be green, but now they're red.

133
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:22,800
 - That's the thing though.

134
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,120
 Like he is responsible for that, I suppose,

135
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,560
 but they did exist in France.

136
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,040
 They did exist in Belgium.

137
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:31,200
 The stamp had been invented about 30 or 40 years earlier.

138
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:33,640
 It feels like we might have got there anyway,

139
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:34,480
 even without him.

140
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:37,320
 - Maybe totally, but he's the one who did, yeah.

141
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:40,320
 Hey, here's a cool quote just to sort of really hammer home

142
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,880
 what a workaholic he was.

143
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:44,760
 He said, "There is no human bliss equal to 12 hours of work

144
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:47,600
 "with only six hours in which to do it."

145
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,600
 - He was a bit like bankers in 1990s in the UK

146
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:53,600
 because his motto was, "No day without a line."

147
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,440
 - Hey.

148
00:04:54,440 --> 00:05:00,400
 Can we talk a little about Fanny Trollop?

149
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,240
 - Sure. - Yeah.

150
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,440
 - His mum. - Yeah.

151
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:03,280
 - Yes, please.

152
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,080
 - So his parents were very interesting people.

153
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:09,080
 Just briefly, his dad was a complete failure in life.

154
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:10,520
 Sounds harsh, but it is true.

155
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:11,960
 - It must have been someone in a podcast

156
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:13,520
 in 200 years saying that about you.

157
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:14,560
 - I know, I know, and they will.

158
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,080
 I hope they will, I dream of them doing that, you know.

159
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:19,320
 But his father had law work which had failed

160
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,520
 and a farm which had failed.

161
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,680
 And he decided finally to write, I think,

162
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:24,800
 called the Encyclopedia Ecclesiastica,

163
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:27,120
 which would define all the ecclesiastical terms

164
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,600
 that had ever existed.

165
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,880
 And by the time he died,

166
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:31,640
 he was still only on the letter D.

167
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:35,360
 - Ah, to be honest, church is quite a long one.

168
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:38,240
 - Oh, huge, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

169
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,560
 - Yeah, it was R-Men.

170
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:41,080
 There's another biggy guy on the top.

171
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:42,240
 Chassable.

172
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,680
 - I mean, you can see why he-- - Chassel.

173
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:44,800
 - You can see why he struggled, you know.

174
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,000
 - Christian, Catholic.

175
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,080
 - Oh, baby Jesus, starting with David.

176
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,440
 (both laughing)

177
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,280
 - Yeah, yeah.

178
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:54,320
 - Anyway, that was his dad, tricky time.

179
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:58,400
 But his mum was a successful author and mega successful.

180
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,560
 And she made her name by writing a book

181
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,560
 called The Domestic Manners of the Americans.

182
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,520
 'Cause she'd gone to America, set up this business venture

183
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:07,120
 which had completely collapsed and been a disaster.

184
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,840
 And, but then she wrote this book,

185
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:11,360
 which was basically just incredibly rude

186
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,360
 about everyone in the USA.

187
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,200
 It was very, very, very snobbish.

188
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:17,440
 And it became a massive success.

189
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,160
 - She said of people living in New York,

190
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:21,160
 that they were bullying, struggling, crafty,

191
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:23,280
 enterprising, industrious, swaggering,

192
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:26,000
 drinking, boasting, and money-getting.

193
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,880
 But then enemy of the podcast, Mark Twain.

194
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:29,720
 - Thank you.

195
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:30,840
 (both laughing)

196
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:33,680
 - He really loved her and he was like basically saying,

197
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:34,920
 well, you know, she's telling the truth.

198
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:37,600
 That's what we're like, fair enough, fair play.

199
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,160
 - So he liked her, so I now don't like her.

200
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,000
 Great, okay, thank you.

201
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,640
 I'm sort of keeping my beef going throughout the century.

202
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:46,400
 - One thing I noticed from reading the first 50 pages

203
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:51,400
 by Chester Towers is how hackish he is with names.

204
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:52,600
 - Oh, really?

205
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,360
 - I don't know if you notice the same with the ones

206
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,320
 that you've read before.

207
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:56,640
 - I've only read the way we live now.

208
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:58,520
 - Well, like the first two,

209
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:00,360
 a couple of the first characters are,

210
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:02,880
 I think the policemen and they're called

211
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,800
 Landon Mew New and Omicron Pie,

212
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,800
 where he's basically just taken Greek letters

213
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,200
 and turned them into names.

214
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,040
 - Right.

215
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:12,840
 - So what he used to do quite a lot is do that thing

216
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:14,640
 where, I suppose Dickens did it a bit,

217
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:17,780
 where you just take whatever attribute your character has

218
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:19,120
 and just call them that.

219
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,680
 - Oh yeah, Dickens is, yeah.

220
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:21,520
 - Right, yeah.

221
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:24,160
 - So in his novel, Miss Mackenzie,

222
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,960
 it's about a young woman who's pursued by three men

223
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:29,880
 who are called Handcock, Rub and Ball.

224
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:30,720
 - What?

225
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,080
 (both laughing)

226
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,280
 - And there was another man.

227
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,120
 - Handcock?

228
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:34,960
 - Handcock?

229
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,200
 (both laughing)

230
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:39,080
 - And there's another man in it where he's not a suitable

231
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:42,680
 suitor for this woman, and he's called Mr. Frigidae.

232
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:43,520
 - Wow.

233
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,320
 - I mean, they're so on the note.

234
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:47,320
 - It takes a bit of the suspense out of it, doesn't it?

235
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:49,120
 - Yeah, I think so.

236
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,880
 I wonder if I can give you some names of characters

237
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:54,600
 and you can tell me what they did in the novel.

238
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,560
 - Oh, okay, yeah, great.

239
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,240
 - So Dick Rabbit.

240
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:01,280
 - Ended up in prison.

241
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,880
 - So, Shaggy Rabbit, obviously, yeah.

242
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:05,400
 Had lots of kids, breed it a lot.

243
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,240
 - Nice.

244
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,640
 - No, he was the leader of a hunt.

245
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:08,480
 - Okay.

246
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,520
 - Yeah, good.

247
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:10,840
 - Samuel Nickham.

248
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:11,680
 - Policeman?

249
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:12,520
 - Police, yeah, yeah.

250
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:13,360
 - Kind of.

251
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,040
 He wasn't a policeman, but he found evidence against

252
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:17,240
 some people who've been poisoning animals.

253
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,280
 - I was going to say shoplifter,

254
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:19,960
 and I've only just realized that nicking him

255
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:23,360
 is something that shoplifters do, and policemen do.

256
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,200
 I nick him.

257
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,240
 No, I nick him.

258
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,320
 We're on opposite sides.

259
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,320
 How confusing.

260
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:28,880
 - Gosh, yeah, food for thought.

261
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:32,280
 - So, Oliver Crumblewit.

262
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:34,040
 - Stand up, stand up comedian.

263
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:34,880
 - Yeah.

264
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,080
 - Someone who thinks they're funny.

265
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:38,960
 So, like, this is on a dad joke

266
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:41,840
 to call back to the previous episode character.

267
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:43,440
 - No, he was a phrenologist.

268
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,280
 - Crumble.

269
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:46,200
 - So, just like, witless person,

270
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,480
 I guess he was slugging off phrenology.

271
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,720
 And Joe Thurabug.

272
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:51,560
 - Thurabug.

273
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:53,720
 (all laughing)

274
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:54,560
 - Proctologist.

275
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:57,800
 (all laughing)

276
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,160
 - No, he was a brewer, of course.

277
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:00,000
 - Oh, very nice.

278
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,640
 - Brewer, I was going to say the bunghole in the sherry.

279
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:02,480
 That's right.

280
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,280
 Did you, sorry, just while we're quickly

281
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:06,880
 on Barchester Towers, have you ever got to a bit

282
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,960
 in the book where he injects himself as a narrator?

283
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,920
 Because that's something he apparently loves to do.

284
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:12,760
 So, he does it twice.

285
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:13,600
 - He pops in.

286
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,420
 - He pops in.

287
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:15,240
 So, for example, there's a sentence

288
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,760
 that comes in that book where it says,

289
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:18,440
 "How easily she would have forgiven

290
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:20,520
 "and forgotten the Archdeacon's suspicions

291
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:23,000
 "had she heard the whole truth from Mr. Arobin,

292
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,200
 "but then where would have been my novel?"

293
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:28,520
 - Oh, I didn't notice that, I love it.

294
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:30,680
 - And then right at the end, he says,

295
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:32,680
 "The end of a novel, like the end of a children's

296
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:34,880
 "dinner party must be filled with sweet meats

297
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:37,080
 "and sugar plums, obviously alluding maybe

298
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:39,200
 "to a nice happy ending."

299
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:43,000
 - Yes, followed by tears, someone being sick,

300
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,480
 people being dragged home, screaming.

301
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,720
 - Nits being spread.

302
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:49,200
 - Yeah, he does do that self-consciously a little bit.

303
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,120
 Yeah, sometimes we'll be like,

304
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:52,600
 "She's my favorite, actually, she's lovely."

305
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,440
 - I think that's good.

306
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,400
 I mean, Jane Austen does that all the time,

307
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,840
 just sort of pops her head around the curtain

308
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,480
 and says, "Hello," and then pops back.

309
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:58,320
 I like it.

310
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,840
 Have you heard of his novel, The Fixed Period?

311
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:01,840
 This is very weird.

312
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:05,600
 So this was his, I think, only venture into sci-fi

313
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:09,840
 where it's set in 1980 on a fictional island

314
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:12,120
 in the southern hemisphere called Britannula.

315
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:14,160
 And the main point of the story is that it has

316
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,520
 compulsory euthanasia for anyone

317
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:18,520
 between the age of 67 and 68, that's the idea.

318
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:21,680
 It also features a futuristic cricket match.

319
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,640
 - Bit harsh, you can't get to the best age.

320
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:26,160
 - Right, yeah, yeah.

321
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,880
 - Maybe he was sick of all the innuendo.

322
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:30,480
 - Right, there's a steam tricycle

323
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,400
 which can go at 25 miles an hour.

324
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,000
 So it's still rooted in the 19th century.

325
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,520
 But, get this, Trollope died at the age of 67 and a half.

326
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:39,360
 - Did he?

327
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:43,640
 - Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.

328
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:45,280
 He didn't do much on the sci-fi,

329
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:47,080
 but basically, I think his novels were essentially

330
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,640
 a Marvel marvel.

331
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:49,480
 - Marvel?

332
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:50,800
 - Marvel, sorry.

333
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:51,640
 - Andrew Marvel.

334
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:53,280
 - An Andrew Marvel universe.

335
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:54,440
 - 17th century Laureate.

336
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:55,280
 - Yeah.

337
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,120
 - Yes.

338
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:56,960
 (laughing)

339
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:57,800
 - That's so funny.

340
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,560
 - It's how they, but world enough and time,

341
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:00,560
 they would, is that him?

342
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:01,400
 - Yeah, very good.

343
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:03,760
 - And then they would have written a Marvel comic

344
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:04,760
 because he basically did that.

345
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:06,280
 He created a universe.

346
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:08,240
 - Ah, right, oh, lovely, yeah, yeah.

347
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,960
 - And I think this kind of explains why he was able

348
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,160
 to churn things out so much,

349
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:12,400
 as well as the fact that when you read them,

350
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,640
 there are a lot of extra words.

351
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:16,440
 But like the passage of chronicles,

352
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:18,040
 oh well, you can lose a lot.

353
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:20,320
 - Have you ever read, sorry to, this is a digression,

354
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,320
 but have you ever read the Wumble books?

355
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,160
 - No.

356
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:25,160
 - I was reading the Wumble books to my daughter

357
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:27,000
 and all the way through, it's like,

358
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,440
 and then the Wumble went to the park

359
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,920
 and picked up some litter.

360
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:33,860
 They picked up an umbrella, a bag of crisps,

361
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:37,080
 like this, and they just fill up all the sentences

362
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:38,640
 with just lists of nonsense.

363
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,320
 - That's your word count for the day.

364
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,360
 That's Trollup thinking, right,

365
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:44,200
 I put in 16 adjectives to describe this table.

366
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:46,240
 That's fine, I can knock off for the next five minutes.

367
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,820
 - Can't believe you're reading the Wumble books.

368
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:49,160
 'Cause I thought it was just a TV show.

369
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:50,520
 You're the guy who's like, you know,

370
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:51,360
 the books are actually--

371
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,680
 - The novelizations of the Wumbles

372
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:55,040
 are actually really, yeah, yeah, yeah.

373
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,880
 - I think the books came before the TV show.

374
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,360
 - Oh, sure they did, yeah.

375
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,200
 - Anyway.

376
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,680
 - So it's the Trollup Cinematic Universe.

377
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:04,600
 - The Cinematic Universe, so it embosses shit.

378
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,640
 It's really fun, so I've only read one

379
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:08,400
 and actually it's The Way We Live Now, which isn't the universe,

380
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,960
 but my husband happens to have read quite a few more

381
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:12,920
 and he says it's fun 'cause characters pop in

382
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:13,760
 from other places.

383
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,680
 - Lovely, I love it, I love it, I love it a lot.

384
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:18,280
 - So that Vick who was quite annoying when he was 25

385
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:20,600
 is now 40 and he's a bit wiser.

386
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:23,120
 - I reckon that he had hyper-fantasia.

387
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:23,960
 - Oh yeah.

388
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:25,240
 - Which is, so I have a fantasia,

389
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:27,360
 which means I can't imagine things,

390
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,120
 but some people have hyper-fantasia

391
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,640
 where you really can't imagine anything.

392
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:33,360
 It's like just an incredible story going on in your head

393
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,920
 and sometimes you don't even realize that it's in your head.

394
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:39,440
 And he used to say that his main work that he did was

395
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,240
 when he was daydreaming.

396
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:43,360
 So, you know, he would churn out these words,

397
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,120
 but actually the rest of the day he'd just be thinking,

398
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,640
 "Oh, I wonder what my characters would be doing now."

399
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:49,840
 When he came to write them down, it was pretty easy for him

400
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:52,440
 'cause it was just, this is what I remember them doing.

401
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:53,880
 - I think he almost says that the plot

402
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:55,880
 is kind of not even really important.

403
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:59,120
 It's just, it's about the characters exactly, as you say.

404
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,200
 - I want to know what his legs were like

405
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,440
 'cause I think he might have had a fantastic pair of legs.

406
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,400
 - Okay, go on.

407
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:08,280
 - Well, he was all over the UK

408
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:09,880
 for his work for the post office.

409
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:11,000
 It was sent to Ireland, first of all,

410
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,200
 which is where he started writing.

411
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:15,040
 And basically he had to work out the routes for postmen

412
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,680
 and he rode across the countryside.

413
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:19,360
 He did about 40 miles a day riding across the countryside.

414
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,000
 - It feels like the horse would have a good leg.

415
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:21,960
 - No, you're right, sorry.

416
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:23,720
 He'd have a great bum.

417
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:26,000
 But he was a member of a thing called the Tramp Society,

418
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,760
 which was a ramblers club across Southeast England.

419
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,560
 They just walked huge distances every time they let up.

420
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,680
 Yeah, so I think, I think his lower half

421
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:34,120
 might have been incredibly fit.

422
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:36,200
 - Well, in support, I think of that.

423
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,240
 Do you know what the hardest day's work

424
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:38,360
 he ever did in his life was?

425
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:39,520
 And that's a high bar for Truller.

426
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:40,880
 - Oh, no.

427
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,480
 - It was walking.

428
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:45,120
 And it was when he was posted to Glasgow

429
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:48,960
 and he wanted to review postman's jobs, basically.

430
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,720
 And postmen in Glasgow were having to go

431
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:51,680
 up and down tenement blocks,

432
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,960
 sometimes to just post a letter to one person.

433
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:57,120
 And he walked the full Glasgow postman's route

434
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,800
 up and downstairs on his beat

435
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,680
 and came back to the post office and none of them was like,

436
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:02,120
 "Hey, those guys have it really rough.

437
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,280
 We need to sort it out."

438
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:04,120
 - Yes.

439
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:06,720
 - His second-ever novel sold 140 copies.

440
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:07,560
 - Okay.

441
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:08,920
 - Yeah, it did not sell.

442
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:10,400
 - What's that one?

443
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:12,200
 - They were both set in Ireland, his first two.

444
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:14,360
 I think he saw a picture of them and published them out.

445
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:15,280
 Oh, I don't know.

446
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:16,800
 But the publisher had a resort to advert saying,

447
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,280
 "Do you know who this guy's mum is?

448
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:20,200
 This guy's mum is Fanny Truller."

449
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:22,920
 - Fanny Truller, which is so embarrassing

450
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:25,720
 as a young debut novelist, you know.

451
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:27,600
 What a quote for the front of the book.

452
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,680
 "Do you know who his mum is?"

453
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:32,260
 (upbeat music)

454
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:37,040
 - Okay, it is time for fact number two.

455
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:38,320
 And that is my fact.

456
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,480
 My fact this week is that in 2008,

457
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:43,280
 a TV channel spent the day rescheduling shows

458
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:45,200
 so that millions of people in India

459
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:47,240
 could continue to watch a live broadcast

460
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:49,560
 of a man trying to kill another man

461
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:51,760
 using nothing but his mind.

462
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:52,600
 - Okay.

463
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:53,440
 - And it took longer than expected.

464
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,040
 Is it like when a football match goes into extra time

465
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:56,640
 and you have to cancel the news afterwards?

466
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:58,280
 - It's like that tennis.

467
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:00,120
 Do you remember, it was at Mahut Isner?

468
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:00,960
 - Mahut Isner.

469
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,600
 - Which went on, it was a Wimbledon several,

470
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:04,680
 like 10 years ago now, and it went on,

471
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:06,880
 they played like 70 games each.

472
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:07,720
 - Yeah, it was something like that.

473
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:08,560
 - It was something like crackers.

474
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:09,640
 - Yeah, it was kind of that.

475
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:11,920
 - And Mahut Isner, I imagine, got closer to death

476
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:14,120
 than the person who was trying to be killed here.

477
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:15,400
 - Well, not quite, actually.

478
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:18,440
 So, okay, at that time, there was a politician

479
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:19,840
 who said out loud that she thought

480
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:21,440
 that someone was attacking her mentally

481
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,720
 using Tantric powers, which is, you know,

482
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:25,640
 when we talk about Tantric sex and all that,

483
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:28,120
 there's a side of it, which is to do with the mind,

484
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:30,080
 and you can supposedly attack people

485
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:33,200
 if you're using the dark practices of it, right?

486
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:35,440
 So, as a result, there was a TV show

487
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:38,040
 where skeptics and Tantra practitioners

488
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:39,640
 were brought together on the show,

489
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:42,000
 it was called Tantric Power versus Science.

490
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,560
 And while on the show, this guy who was called

491
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:48,080
 Pandit Srintheshama claimed that he could kill someone

492
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:50,640
 within minutes using nothing but his mind.

493
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:53,040
 Now, the person who was sitting on the panel with him

494
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,280
 was a guy called Sinal Edamaruku.

495
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:56,560
 - Is he representing Science in this?

496
00:15:56,560 --> 00:16:00,320
 - He is the president of the Rational International Group.

497
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,040
 He says, you can't do that.

498
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:02,880
 You think you can do that?

499
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,120
 Do it to me now.

500
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:06,560
 And the guy says, okay, fine, I'll do it to you now.

501
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,440
 - That's annoying when they call your bluff like that,

502
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:09,800
 isn't it? - Exactly.

503
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:10,960
 So, he says, do it now.

504
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:13,000
 So, they say, all right, let's do this.

505
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,200
 The host of the show is going, all right, let's do this.

506
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:17,240
 - Legally, very tricky water for the channel

507
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:18,800
 and the program to be in. - Exactly.

508
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:21,040
 - 'Cause I'm thinking about all the forms

509
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:23,360
 we have to fill in on QI if you just, you know,

510
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,200
 strike a match.

511
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:28,320
 - You very rarely use dark tantra on QI.

512
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:33,600
 - So, basically what happens is, is this guy, Sharma gets up

513
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,560
 and he starts focusing his mind on him.

514
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:36,920
 It's clearly not working.

515
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:40,000
 The rational guy is sort of giving laps and so on.

516
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,480
 So, Sharma comes over, he starts sprinkling water on him

517
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:45,040
 as an intimidation tactic.

518
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,680
 He starts ruffling his hair.

519
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:50,200
 - Oh, the big guns are coming out now.

520
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,840
 - He covers his eyes.

521
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:52,680
 - It was all that stuff.

522
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:55,520
 But then, and this is where it gets a bit desperate,

523
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:59,120
 he suddenly presses his fingers down onto his forehead

524
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,840
 and steadily really pushes and pushes

525
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:05,200
 and he has to be called out because basically,

526
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,800
 you will kill me 'cause you're trying

527
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,920
 to crush my skull, basically.

528
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:10,800
 So, he has to go back to his seat

529
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,320
 and he has to do it with his mind.

530
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:14,800
 Now, at this point, the show's meant to be ending.

531
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:15,880
 But they say it's not done yet.

532
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:18,760
 So, the show continues and the next show is canceled.

533
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:20,080
 And at this point, word is getting around.

534
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:21,800
 So, people are tuning in and tuning in.

535
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,800
 After a couple of hours, the guy's exhausted,

536
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:25,080
 Sharma's exhausted and he says,

537
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:26,120
 "But I'm not done yet.

538
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:27,800
 "Let's meet again this evening.

539
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:31,200
 "And this evening, I will do the ultimate destruction ceremony

540
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,040
 "and kill you."

541
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:33,920
 What is going through his mind when he's saying,

542
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:35,240
 "I'm gonna do that?"

543
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:37,320
 I'm sure I can think of an ultimate destruction ceremony

544
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:39,480
 in the two hours between the broadcast.

545
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:40,800
 Like, what is his plan?

546
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:44,240
 - But then, I think his plan probably is to not turn up

547
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:47,320
 and then go, "Oh, sorry, I was killing some other person."

548
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:49,520
 They go to another school, you wouldn't know them.

549
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:51,120
 - Yeah, so they do it at night.

550
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:53,800
 It's performed under an altar in an open night sky.

551
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,000
 They've got all the cameras there

552
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,960
 and he tries and tries and tries.

553
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:59,160
 And obviously, the guy who's the rational guy

554
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:00,840
 is laughing his ass off the whole time.

555
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:01,680
 So, it didn't work out.

556
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,960
 But this, just to remind you, is 2008.

557
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:05,280
 And this was broadcast live.

558
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:07,720
 And according to many reports,

559
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:09,080
 some say hundreds of millions,

560
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:10,720
 obviously a huge population in India.

561
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:14,480
 But millions tuned in to see a man killed live on TV,

562
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:15,920
 probably knowing he wasn't gonna be,

563
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:17,360
 but wanted to see what happened.

564
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:18,760
 - I have a question for you guys.

565
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:20,280
 If you were on that TV show

566
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:21,800
 and you were next to a tantric master

567
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:24,440
 and they said, "I could kill someone with my mind,"

568
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:27,360
 would you have the courage to say,

569
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,280
 "No, you can't do it to me."

570
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:30,440
 You definitely would.

571
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:32,440
 There wouldn't be a tiny bit of doubt

572
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:34,400
 that like, I'm pretty sure you can't.

573
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,080
 - Once he started, I'd shit my pants.

574
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:38,560
 But yeah, I would probably call it.

575
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:39,640
 - I would feel fairly confident

576
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:40,480
 that that wouldn't happen.

577
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,840
 - No, but you can't be fairly confident.

578
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:44,880
 - Okay, I would be 100% certain

579
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:45,720
 that that wouldn't happen.

580
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:46,560
 - You'd be up for it.

581
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:49,320
 - I would be pretty confident,

582
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:50,320
 but I would think to myself,

583
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:52,960
 "I'd be so annoyed if I have a heart attack and die."

584
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:53,960
 Unrelatedly.

585
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:56,520
 - When I went to, I was in Bhutan

586
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:59,440
 and I went to the tiger's nest monastery.

587
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,680
 And there's a little bit where you have to jump

588
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:03,200
 from one bit to the other

589
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:07,680
 and you're going over a sheer drop of thousands of feet.

590
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:10,920
 And the step is basically just a step.

591
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:12,680
 It's a step that you do every single day

592
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:14,080
 and it's no problem.

593
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:15,840
 But all the way through, I was thinking,

594
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:18,920
 "If I fall now, what a fucking idiot.

595
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:21,920
 "What an idiot I am to be doing that."

596
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:23,960
 And I suppose it's that kind of thought.

597
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:25,520
 - And the pressure of the TV cameras

598
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:28,320
 will make you think, "This is a very public forum."

599
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,440
 I can understand, I'm very impressed by the skeptic.

600
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:31,920
 - You'd feel embarrassed for him.

601
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,600
 You'd start wanting to die.

602
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,040
 - Yeah, yeah.

603
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:35,880
 - You'd fake it.

604
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:37,160
 - Do you think you'd fake it, Dan?

605
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:38,240
 - I'd fake it.

606
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:40,080
 - Well, it would be really fun

607
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,520
 to draw the death Tantra dude out

608
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:45,560
 by pretending to die and then like, "Aaah."

609
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:46,400
 And that would be great.

610
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,240
 - That's a good point.

611
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:48,760
 - I've never heard of this.

612
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:52,600
 I think of Tantra as primarily a sexual thing.

613
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:55,680
 Now, I'm thinking about Sting.

614
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:56,520
 - Yes.

615
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:59,840
 - Who proclaimed, I think, in the 90s

616
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:02,800
 that he could have sex for five hours because of Tantra.

617
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:04,120
 Just Tantric skills.

618
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:05,240
 - He says he never said that.

619
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:07,360
 - I don't know if he does now, but that's--

620
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:08,200
 - Right.

621
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:10,000
 - He says, "Bob Geldoff spread that rumor."

622
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:10,840
 - Right.

623
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:11,680
 - Yeah.

624
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:12,520
 - And then he said, "Oh, I said five hours,

625
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:14,040
 but that includes dinner and a movie

626
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:15,040
 followed by some begging."

627
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:16,680
 You know, he's got some very funny jokes about it.

628
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:17,800
 Yeah, yeah.

629
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:18,640
 But that was--

630
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:19,480
 - No movie is.

631
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:20,320
 - Lord of the Rings.

632
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,200
 - The entire trilogy.

633
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:24,320
 - No, but I don't know anything about Tantra, really.

634
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:25,160
 Although the idea of Tantra,

635
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:26,440
 and I gather it's more of a philosophy

636
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:27,680
 or a set of philosophies.

637
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:29,480
 And it's from lots of different--

638
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:30,320
 - Very complicated.

639
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:32,760
 - Lots of different religions have elements of Tantra.

640
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:33,600
 - Definitely, yeah.

641
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,320
 - That sort of spread across all these different schools

642
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:36,160
 of thought.

643
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:37,000
 - There's no one thing.

644
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,400
 And when I say the dark side or whatever,

645
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,920
 that's so rare, it's not really even a thing.

646
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:44,040
 We'll get letters, people saying,

647
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:44,880
 "That's not a thing."

648
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:45,720
 - Right, right, right, yeah.

649
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:46,760
 - Well, there's space in Hinduism.

650
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:47,600
 - Yeah.

651
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:48,680
 - When we say lots of different religions.

652
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:51,320
 And it's not its own belief system within Hinduism

653
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:52,160
 as far as I can tell.

654
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:54,360
 It's like a series of practices

655
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:57,040
 which seem to exist in lots of strands of Hinduism.

656
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:59,360
 - Yeah, it's almost like non-Orphodox Hinduism.

657
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:00,200
 - Yeah.

658
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:02,440
 In fact, I did read things saying the whole point of it

659
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:05,600
 was to subvert Hinduism and encourage lots of things

660
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,040
 that Hinduism does not.

661
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:09,520
 Like, I think there's one where you're encouraged

662
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:12,000
 to have the special Tantric fivesm,

663
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,280
 which is like eating meat, drinking wine.

664
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:15,120
 - Right.

665
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:16,920
 (all laughing)

666
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:17,840
 - Have you ever had a fivesm?

667
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:21,160
 Yeah, I've had a bit of meat and a drink, a bit of wine, yeah?

668
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:22,800
 - Coming to the party to make it.

669
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:23,640
 - I didn't have--

670
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:24,480
 - Wine's everyone in there.

671
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:25,480
 - Yes.

672
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:27,600
 - God, that looks delicious.

673
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:28,760
 I've had a foursome.

674
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:30,240
 I didn't have the sherry at the end,

675
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,480
 which would have been, you know.

676
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:33,280
 - To be fair, sex is the last one.

677
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:35,120
 - Oh, okay, okay.

678
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:35,960
 So it's like a date.

679
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:36,800
 We're not describing a date.

680
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:38,120
 - Are we describing a date?

681
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:39,120
 - What are the previous four?

682
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:39,960
 Is there an order?

683
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:40,960
 - Netflix.

684
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:41,800
 - Sorry.

685
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:47,280
 - It's drinking, eating, movie, begging.

686
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,160
 (all laughing)

687
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,280
 Sex.

688
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:53,760
 - So the five are alcohol, meat, fish, grain, and sex.

689
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:54,600
 - Okay.

690
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:55,680
 - You're very full at that point,

691
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:56,760
 so it's not very pleasant.

692
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:57,920
 - We do that five at home,

693
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:59,760
 but the fifth one is always headache.

694
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:01,760
 (all laughing)

695
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,000
 - I'm really annoyed.

696
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,840
 - But the idea is violating all these Hindu taboos.

697
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:07,680
 - I see.

698
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:10,200
 - And I think that's called left-handed tantra.

699
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:12,200
 So there's left-handed tantra and right-handed tantra,

700
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:14,160
 and left-handed tantra is the sex one.

701
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:15,400
 - I'm left-handed.

702
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,480
 - Well, that doesn't surprise me.

703
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:17,840
 - No, no, no, no.

704
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:19,880
 It's all starting to come together.

705
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,520
 - I always do left-handed tantra,

706
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,440
 'cause it feels like someone else is doing that.

707
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:26,040
 (all laughing)

708
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:29,440
 - There's no thousand-year-old tradition

709
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:30,720
 we can be trusted with.

710
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,200
 (all laughing)

711
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:35,120
 - Other things that are done in tantra traditions

712
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:38,240
 that are non-sexual for the right-handed,

713
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:40,960
 living in cemeteries, if you want that,

714
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,960
 and smearing cremation ashes on your body.

715
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:45,640
 So these are all agori rituals.

716
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:47,120
 - And do you say agori?

717
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:47,960
 - Yeah.

718
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:48,880
 - 'Cause it sounds quite gory.

719
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:51,960
 - Oh yeah, agori tradition, yes.

720
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:53,000
 - I was just missering.

721
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:53,840
 - No, that's very good.

722
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:57,480
 Maybe it's a fun play on words, 'cause it is very dark.

723
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:59,120
 They smoke a lot of marijuana,

724
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:00,920
 not too dark, they drink a lot of alcohol,

725
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:02,560
 and they meditate on top of corpses.

726
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:03,960
 - I got some good news for you, Dan.

727
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:05,040
 - Yeah.

728
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:07,880
 - So they're meditating on a corpse.

729
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:09,440
 There are quite a lot of rules

730
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:12,240
 about the kind of corpse that you can meditate on.

731
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:14,920
 Ideally, it would be someone who died from drowning,

732
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:17,480
 lightning strikes, snake bites, something like that.

733
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:19,920
 You are allowed to kill the person

734
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:22,440
 before you meditate on top of them,

735
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:26,240
 but you shouldn't really meditate on top of a man

736
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:29,800
 with a beard or on top of a wife guy.

737
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:34,560
 - Anyone who's hand-packed, you shouldn't be doing.

738
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:35,720
 - Really?

739
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:37,880
 - Wow, Dan, you're in the clear.

740
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:40,160
 - I am safe and sound, guys.

741
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:43,640
 - Wow.

742
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:46,880
 - But what about a clean-shaven bad boy like me, James?

743
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:49,360
 Am I in the firing line for getting meditated on?

744
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:50,200
 - Oh dear.

745
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:52,280
 - That's amazing.

746
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:55,160
 - I read an amazing way of if someone,

747
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:57,160
 if so, let's say we are on that show

748
00:23:57,160 --> 00:24:00,520
 and we have said yes, consenting to Sharma

749
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:02,320
 trying to kill us with his mind.

750
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:05,200
 One way of getting him out of your mind

751
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:08,120
 and shaking off the bad juju that's inside there

752
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:09,600
 is something that was practiced

753
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:13,440
 by a guy called Viktor Kortchnoy, who's a chess player.

754
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:14,280
 - Yeah.

755
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:16,520
 - Now, we spoke many episodes ago

756
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:20,000
 about a very famous chess championship in 1978,

757
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,960
 and there were two Russian grandmaster chess players,

758
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:25,280
 Karpov against Kortchnoy.

759
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:28,200
 And basically, Kortchnoy, as he was sitting there,

760
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:32,000
 had a guy in the audience who was mentally trying

761
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,600
 to ruin his game, get into his head.

762
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:37,240
 It was the weirdest chess game ever, right?

763
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:39,680
 Kortchnoy eventually brings in two people

764
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:43,080
 who practice the idea of all this mind power stuff.

765
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:45,440
 And he genuinely did this during the course of the game

766
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:48,000
 to get rid of all the bad thoughts that were in his head.

767
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,120
 You do a handstand so that you can shake it out

768
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:53,520
 using the gravity that's pulling down to the earth,

769
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:54,560
 all the bad vibes.

770
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:56,680
 So, if ever you're in a space

771
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:59,760
 where you think you're being infiltrated in your mind,

772
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:00,800
 do a handstand.

773
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:02,280
 - If you believe, though.

774
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:03,120
 - Yeah.

775
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:04,880
 - I mean, we're sort of skirting around the psychosomatic thing.

776
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,120
 If you believe that someone is in the crowd

777
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:06,960
 getting into your head.

778
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:07,800
 - Which he did.

779
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:08,640
 - Then they're already in there.

780
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:09,480
 - Yeah.

781
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:10,320
 - And he was in there.

782
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:11,480
 Like, that's exactly it.

783
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:12,560
 He believed that was in there.

784
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:13,440
 - Did he win?

785
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:14,280
 - He lost.

786
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:15,600
 Only just by one game.

787
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,320
 He was down, and then he did the handstand thing,

788
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:19,240
 and he came back for like a few games.

789
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:20,680
 And then he lost the final game.

790
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:23,200
 - Didn't shake that last bit out, did he?

791
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:28,240
 - This just reminded me of another interesting Hindu sect,

792
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:30,960
 which I've been fond of for a while, the Nagasadhus.

793
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:31,800
 - Okay.

794
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:34,160
 - Which, we've talked about the Naked Sadhus,

795
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:35,520
 which who are just naked all the time?

796
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:36,880
 - Sadhus.

797
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:38,920
 - Naked Sadhus, yeah.

798
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:40,320
 So, a lot of this is about asceticism

799
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:41,920
 and renouncing everything.

800
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:44,800
 And they have very strict exercise routines.

801
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:46,920
 So, they're very fit, but they have long beards,

802
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,600
 but they have no clothes.

803
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:51,440
 They also smear themselves in ashes.

804
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:53,800
 I think this seems to be a thing.

805
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:56,440
 But they were great fighters back in the day.

806
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:57,880
 So, they've been around for many hundreds,

807
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:59,080
 for thousands of years.

808
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:00,400
 And they were military men.

809
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,080
 So, in 19th century reports,

810
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:03,520
 they wore nothing but a belt,

811
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:06,400
 and they'd have ammunition and flints and guns

812
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:07,440
 hanging off their belt.

813
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:08,280
 - Wow, like Batman.

814
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:10,280
 - Yeah, but nude Batman.

815
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:12,040
 - Yes, 'cause he normally is wearing

816
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:13,760
 the full Batman outfit.

817
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:15,440
 - He's in fact a bit too covered up, really.

818
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,840
 - Yeah, yeah, but I'm just mean like the utility belt.

819
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:19,560
 - Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, absolutely.

820
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:20,960
 - They've got the utility belt.

821
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,720
 And that's all you need, really.

822
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:25,120
 And they were great military leaders.

823
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:26,800
 And in fact, there was one in the 18th century

824
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:28,400
 who commanded over 20,000 men.

825
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,440
 In fact, quite a few of them commanded that many.

826
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:34,160
 And in the battles that the British East India Company had

827
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:35,680
 when they were trying to colonize India,

828
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:37,120
 they played a huge role.

829
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:39,560
 And bizarrely, they were often mercenaries.

830
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:41,560
 So, they often fought for different sides,

831
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:44,400
 which is weird given that they renounce all possessions.

832
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,120
 So, I don't know what you're using,

833
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:47,320
 all that money you're getting paid.

834
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:48,880
 - Oh, you gotta, you know, there are,

835
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:51,560
 there are incidental expenditures and you, you know,

836
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:52,880
 you want to have something for a rainy day.

837
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,280
 - You want a really nice belt.

838
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:57,000
 (all laughing)

839
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,600
 - That beard oil's very pricey, um.

840
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:02,200
 (all laughing)

841
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:04,780
 (upbeat music)

842
00:27:04,780 --> 00:27:10,560
 - Okay, it is time for fact number three.

843
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:12,320
 And that is James.

844
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:14,680
 - Okay, my fact this week is that the last thing

845
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:18,080
 that British soldiers going to the Crimean War saw

846
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:20,640
 was Queen Victoria throwing a shoe at them.

847
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,440
 (all laughing)

848
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:23,600
 - And stay out.

849
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,480
 (all laughing)

850
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:27,080
 - No, this is a good luck thing.

851
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:30,040
 It's been a good luck thing since the 16th century at least.

852
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:32,680
 And Queen Victoria, when she got married,

853
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:34,400
 she had shoes thrown after her.

854
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:37,200
 So, she obviously had this idea that it was good luck.

855
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:40,720
 And there is an 1854 sketch from Punch Magazine

856
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:43,440
 that shows her throwing a shoe at her soldiers

857
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:45,200
 as they go off for the Crimean War.

858
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,680
 - It's very, I'd never heard this tradition at all.

859
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:49,120
 Shoe-trucking for luck.

860
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,240
 I've just never, ever heard it.

861
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:51,080
 But she did it a lot.

862
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:52,520
 She did it in 1855.

863
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:55,400
 She chucked shoes into Balmoral Castle again for luck.

864
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:56,320
 And that was a.

865
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:58,160
 - And is it she takes one of her own shoes off

866
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:59,800
 or does she take an extra shoe in her handbag?

867
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:00,640
 - Great question.

868
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:01,480
 - Good question.

869
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:02,320
 - Don't know.

870
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:03,680
 - Yeah, so the first one she's throwing it off

871
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:06,200
 from where she's, she's standing on a balcony.

872
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:07,040
 - That's right.

873
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:07,880
 - So, okay, so she's at home.

874
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:09,080
 She's probably in slippers anyway.

875
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:11,080
 So, she could do that with a shoe.

876
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:12,240
 - And you don't want to chuck a really heavy shoe

877
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:13,080
 in case I hit someone.

878
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:13,920
 - Yeah.

879
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:14,760
 - Well, it's from a balcony.

880
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:15,600
 It seems quite risky.

881
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:16,440
 - That's gonna be my question.

882
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:17,760
 Do we know where the shoe is?

883
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:19,280
 'Cause I couldn't, I couldn't find it.

884
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:20,120
 - The shoe?

885
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:20,960
 - Yeah, the shoe.

886
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:22,880
 - I don't know how many of you have been victorious.

887
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,240
 - Yeah, shoes are forever.

888
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:27,000
 - Yeah, but the shoe, lots of shoe traditions.

889
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,440
 Hiding shoes in the walls of your building.

890
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:29,520
 That was not the big one, wasn't it?

891
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:30,860
 - Yeah.

892
00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:32,200
 - Is that for good luck?

893
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:33,760
 Or just for a rainy day?

894
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:35,040
 - To ward off evil.

895
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:36,840
 - Ah, evil hates shoes.

896
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:39,800
 - Yes, the Northampton made all,

897
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:41,080
 basically all the shoes made in the UK

898
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:41,920
 came from Northampton.

899
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:42,760
 - Really?

900
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:43,840
 - Yeah, 'cause it was Chewtown.

901
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:45,480
 - That's why the football team's called the Cobblers.

902
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:46,320
 - Oh, is it?

903
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:47,520
 I didn't know they were.

904
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:49,640
 But they've got a thing called the Hidden Shoe Index

905
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:51,240
 at the Northampton Museum.

906
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:53,720
 - I read it was called the Concealed Shoe Index,

907
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:56,480
 which made me wonder what CSI Northampton would be like.

908
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:58,000
 (laughing)

909
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:58,840
 - Very strong.

910
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:00,960
 I don't know which is the true name.

911
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:02,640
 It goes back to the '50s though,

912
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,840
 but the oldest shoe they've got or found in a building

913
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:06,400
 dates back to 1308.

914
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:07,240
 - Wow.

915
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:08,160
 - That was concealed in a building, yeah.

916
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,640
 - That's not gonna be wearable, is it?

917
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:10,480
 - No.

918
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:11,300
 - Is this related to,

919
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:13,880
 I mentioned cats being found in buildings.

920
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:14,720
 That's the thing, isn't it?

921
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,240
 That people would bury their dead cats.

922
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:19,240
 - Yeah, war-lover's cat, frogs as well.

923
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:20,360
 - Frogs, yes.

924
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:21,400
 Presumably that was for good luck.

925
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:26,160
 - I think it's to also attract or distract or deter witches.

926
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:27,520
 We're back to the evil thing.

927
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:28,360
 - Distract.

928
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:29,200
 Is that what I kept?

929
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,040
 (laughing)

930
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:31,160
 That's what I was doing.

931
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:33,520
 Maybe one of the most famous shoe-throwing incidents

932
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:37,320
 is when George Bush had two shoes thrown at him, in fact.

933
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:40,660
 It's in 2008 by an Iraqi reporter.

934
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:44,040
 And actually, I was rereading what George Bush said

935
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:45,680
 when he was asked about it afterwards.

936
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:47,200
 And I thought, you know,

937
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:48,560
 there was a lot of criticism of George Bush

938
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:49,560
 at the time, understandably.

939
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:52,400
 But he said, "I know I wasn't offended.

940
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:54,360
 "We're in a democracy.

941
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:55,400
 "This is freedom for you.

942
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:58,040
 "You're allowed to do this kind of thing."

943
00:29:58,040 --> 00:29:59,800
 Which is very mature of him, well done.

944
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:00,880
 - The guy was then imprisoned

945
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:03,400
 and I think beaten very badly.

946
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:05,480
 - He asked a lot of tea, I think.

947
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:07,680
 - I think it was by the Iraqi authorities,

948
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:08,520
 rather than by anyone else.

949
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:10,860
 But yes, it was a sentiment bang on.

950
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:13,180
 - They did a massive shoe statue, didn't they?

951
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:14,020
 Statue.

952
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:14,840
 - Didn't they?

953
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:15,680
 - Yeah.

954
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:16,520
 - Nice.

955
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:17,360
 - Wait, who's in Iraq?

956
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:18,200
 - In Iraq, yeah.

957
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:20,320
 But it was done, I think it was done at a university

958
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:21,860
 or something and they had to take it down

959
00:30:21,860 --> 00:30:24,020
 'cause it was seen as being political.

960
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:24,860
 - When they tore it down,

961
00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:25,700
 did they run over and beat it

962
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:27,360
 with miniature statues of Saddam Hussein?

963
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:30,100
 (laughing)

964
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:32,300
 - I love that the museum in America

965
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:35,940
 that has, as one of its exhibits, a replica of the shoe.

966
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:36,780
 - Oh, really?

967
00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:37,620
 Not even the shoe?

968
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:39,880
 - No, the shoes were destroyed by the CIA.

969
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:40,720
 - Right.

970
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:43,060
 - Sorry, I've never sounded more conspiracies

971
00:30:43,060 --> 00:30:44,320
 and winged that whack-off.

972
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:46,220
 Sorry, but they actually were,

973
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:48,520
 because I think they didn't want the shoes to become martyrs.

974
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:51,400
 - Do the CIA need to be drafted into destroy shoes?

975
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:52,740
 I reckon you get the intern.

976
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:53,560
 - Maybe it was the FBI.

977
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:54,400
 - Or the Secret Service, maybe.

978
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:56,460
 - It was the Secret Service, sorry, it was the Secret Service.

979
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:57,900
 But it became big business as well.

980
00:30:57,900 --> 00:30:59,900
 All these rival cobalas in the area started claiming,

981
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:02,000
 "Oh yes, that's our shoe."

982
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:02,840
 - Really?

983
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:03,680
 - Yeah.

984
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:06,340
 And the thrower, Mundar al-Zaidi,

985
00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:09,900
 he was offered a couple of hands in marriage

986
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:11,940
 by various people who said,

987
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:14,020
 "I'd like you to marry my daughter."

988
00:31:14,020 --> 00:31:16,720
 And then, in 2009, he was doing an event,

989
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:19,380
 the year after he did the thing, guess what happened?

990
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:20,220
 - You got a shoe thrown at him?

991
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:21,320
 - He got a shoe thrown at him.

992
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:23,060
 Yeah, it was a real circle of life thing.

993
00:31:23,060 --> 00:31:25,360
 - Come up and buy Bush, or?

994
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:26,360
 - Not buy Bush.

995
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:28,400
 (all laughing)

996
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:30,460
 - But Bush has had more shoes thrown at him since.

997
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:32,200
 There's a whole, I mean, it became a thing

998
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:33,860
 post that event generally.

999
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:35,080
 So there's a whole Wikipedia page

1000
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:37,740
 where it's a shoe throwing incident, it's called,

1001
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:39,640
 and it gives you a big timeline,

1002
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:44,640
 and it really picks up after old mate Bush was attacked.

1003
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:46,600
 There's a famous incident as well.

1004
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:49,200
 Queen Elizabeth, the late Queen, in Australia.

1005
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,040
 - Second?

1006
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:50,880
 - Yeah.

1007
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:54,100
 She threw a shoe at Philip when they were in Australia.

1008
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:56,520
 It was one of the only moments where a fight,

1009
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:58,360
 I think in fact, the only incident in which a fight

1010
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:00,560
 was seen between Philip and the Queen,

1011
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:02,520
 she threw a tennis racket at him as well.

1012
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:03,720
 - A tennis racket?

1013
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:04,560
 - Yeah.

1014
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:06,320
 - The Aussies were filming from a distance,

1015
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:08,600
 and they were like, "Geez, what did we just see?"

1016
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:10,640
 'Cause we've never seen anything like that before.

1017
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:12,880
 And so one of the PR people had to come out for the Queen

1018
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:14,440
 and say, "What are you guys doing?"

1019
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:17,040
 With a British accent, they're like, "Oh, the Nazi accent."

1020
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:18,840
 And then the Queen came out, and she apologised,

1021
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:19,800
 and she said, "Where do you want me?"

1022
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:21,760
 As if to say, "Please don't use that.

1023
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:24,420
 "I'm here now as an embarrassing apology

1024
00:32:24,420 --> 00:32:25,760
 "for you witnessing that."

1025
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:28,360
 But possibly she was wishing him good luck.

1026
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:29,600
 (all laughing)

1027
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:30,440
 - Or whatever affair.

1028
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:33,820
 - With a lucky tennis racket as well, yeah.

1029
00:32:33,820 --> 00:32:35,800
 - All of your lucky clothes are out on the lawn.

1030
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:38,480
 (all laughing)

1031
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:39,320
 - That's so funny.

1032
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:40,240
 - Wow.

1033
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:41,400
 James, have you ever seen...

1034
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:43,080
 I'm asking James specifically this for a reason.

1035
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:44,920
 Have you ever seen a panty tree?

1036
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:46,600
 (all laughing)

1037
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:49,160
 - We know the reason, panty tree.

1038
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:51,400
 - No, but I think I can guess what it is.

1039
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:53,480
 Is it a tree where people leave their pants?

1040
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:54,320
 - That's right.

1041
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:56,040
 - Why would I have seen it?

1042
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:57,320
 - Why would you specifically, isn't it?

1043
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:58,800
 - Is it common in Bolton?

1044
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:00,040
 - It's not a Bolton thing.

1045
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:01,200
 - I bet it's a golf thing.

1046
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:02,800
 - Oh, it's a sporting thing.

1047
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:05,620
 - I thought it was just because James makes a habit

1048
00:33:05,620 --> 00:33:07,700
 of visiting all the weird places in the world.

1049
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:08,540
 And it sounds weird.

1050
00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:10,180
 - And it's a pervert.

1051
00:33:10,180 --> 00:33:12,580
 Or maybe I'm like Tom Jones and wherever I walk,

1052
00:33:12,580 --> 00:33:14,060
 people just throw pants at me.

1053
00:33:14,060 --> 00:33:14,900
 - That's it.

1054
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:16,620
 - Whenever I'm walking in the forest.

1055
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:17,620
 (all laughing)

1056
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:19,500
 - You are the panty tree, actually.

1057
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:20,980
 (all laughing)

1058
00:33:20,980 --> 00:33:23,060
 - No, the reason I asked is 'cause I know James

1059
00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:24,940
 has been on a skiing holiday.

1060
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:25,780
 - Yeah.

1061
00:33:25,780 --> 00:33:28,580
 - But I think you, probably all of you guys

1062
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:30,740
 in metropolitan elites are always skiing.

1063
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:33,160
 But no, apparently it's a thing on for a ski lift

1064
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:34,840
 because your ski lift goes very high, doesn't it?

1065
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:36,560
 And it passes over some trees.

1066
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:38,880
 And in some ski resorts, there are trees

1067
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:42,240
 where people chuck their panties onto the tree.

1068
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:43,080
 - I've seen that.

1069
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:45,400
 And I thought it was a Mardi Gras thing.

1070
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:46,480
 But there were loads.

1071
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:50,240
 And there was lots of sparkly, bras-y, panty.

1072
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:51,680
 Oh my God, and that's a thing.

1073
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:52,520
 - That's a thing.

1074
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:55,360
 I think they don't love it, the skiing authorities.

1075
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:56,680
 - Why do they care?

1076
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:57,520
 - I don't know.

1077
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:58,360
 (all laughing)

1078
00:33:58,360 --> 00:33:59,200
 - Sorry, I don't know.

1079
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:00,040
 - What's their problem?

1080
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:00,860
 - It's hard to get your neck.

1081
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:01,700
 - Literate.

1082
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:02,540
 - Yeah, it is, yeah.

1083
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:03,380
 It must be hard to get your knickers off

1084
00:34:03,380 --> 00:34:04,220
 on a ski lift though.

1085
00:34:04,220 --> 00:34:05,060
 Like, that's a tough.

1086
00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:06,220
 - I don't think they're doing that at all.

1087
00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:07,540
 (all laughing)

1088
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:09,140
 - 'Cause you're wearing like your ski suit.

1089
00:34:09,140 --> 00:34:09,980
 - Exactly.

1090
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:11,180
 - And you've gotta pull them off

1091
00:34:11,180 --> 00:34:13,100
 and then pull them all over the ski.

1092
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:13,940
 - Exactly.

1093
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:14,780
 - I don't think it's possible.

1094
00:34:14,780 --> 00:34:15,980
 - And your skis as well.

1095
00:34:15,980 --> 00:34:17,100
 (all laughing)

1096
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:19,700
 - You have to take your skis off, they're gonna fall.

1097
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:20,540
 - Yeah.

1098
00:34:20,540 --> 00:34:21,980
 - No, I reckon it's a spare pair of pants

1099
00:34:21,980 --> 00:34:23,460
 situation in the pocket, isn't it?

1100
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:24,300
 - Very interesting.

1101
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:25,140
 - Probably is it.

1102
00:34:25,140 --> 00:34:25,980
 - Very interesting.

1103
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:26,900
 - Yeah.

1104
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:29,600
 - I occasionally have dropped a ski pole

1105
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:32,200
 when going up on a ski lift as I'm sure many people have.

1106
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:34,040
 And obviously we hire our skis

1107
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:35,840
 and then we went back and we said,

1108
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:38,640
 "We dropped our ski pole, can we pay for the ski pole?"

1109
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:39,960
 They said, "Oh no, don't worry about it."

1110
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:42,020
 Because at the end of the season,

1111
00:34:42,020 --> 00:34:43,520
 when all the snow melts,

1112
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:46,160
 someone goes up and collects all of the ski poles off

1113
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:48,720
 and then they just distribute them between all the shops.

1114
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:49,560
 - It's no way.

1115
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:50,400
 - That's amazing.

1116
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:51,240
 - I don't know if that's true.

1117
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:52,080
 - That's what they said.

1118
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:52,920
 - That's amazing.

1119
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:53,760
 - This was in Italy.

1120
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,560
 - It was fine, just give us your panties.

1121
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:56,520
 Give us your panties, mate.

1122
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:59,160
 - In 2016, MPs in the Egyptian parliament

1123
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:00,360
 attacked each other with shoes,

1124
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:02,140
 or one attacked another with a shoe.

1125
00:35:02,140 --> 00:35:04,480
 Which I think is quite sorry.

1126
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:07,480
 - It's a big drop down from a mass shoe wall.

1127
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:08,320
 - No, it wasn't.

1128
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:10,100
 The other one wasn't quick enough off the mark

1129
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:11,200
 taking his shoe off.

1130
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:12,700
 He was actually suspended,

1131
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:13,900
 which I don't know why I sound surprised.

1132
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:15,980
 I suppose you probably would be from our parliament as well.

1133
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:17,820
 - Did they run with the headline,

1134
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:20,540
 S open brackets, C closed brackets,

1135
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:21,380
 Andal.

1136
00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:22,380
 - Ssss.

1137
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:23,220
 - Ssandal.

1138
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:24,040
 - Ssandal.

1139
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:24,880
 - Oh yeah.

1140
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:25,720
 - Ssandal.

1141
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:27,440
 - Gosh, that took us all a long time, didn't it?

1142
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:28,600
 - That was, yeah.

1143
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:29,940
 - No, 'cause I suppose it would have been written

1144
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:30,780
 in Turkish, so.

1145
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:33,440
 (all laughing)

1146
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:35,520
 - But yeah, it sounds like a very exciting moment.

1147
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:38,480
 Tolfik Okasha was the MP who got attacked by a shoe

1148
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:40,080
 because he'd had the Israeli envoy round,

1149
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:42,400
 and one of his fellow MPs objected to that,

1150
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:45,080
 and got angry and hit him with a shoe,

1151
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:47,600
 and had to be escorted from the house waving a shoe.

1152
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:48,760
 I just thought that's a fun addition

1153
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:51,360
 to parliamentary goings on if we want to try it out.

1154
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:52,200
 - Yeah.

1155
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:53,480
 - There's a bit of an irony about Queen Victoria

1156
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:55,840
 showing the shoes at the Crimean War soldiers,

1157
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:59,400
 which is that they had very bad shoe situations

1158
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:00,720
 when they got to the war.

1159
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:01,560
 - Oh, nice.

1160
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:02,400
 - Wow, I froze there badly.

1161
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:04,020
 - They should have kept that one shoe.

1162
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:04,860
 - Well, yeah.

1163
00:36:04,860 --> 00:36:07,680
 They had awful boots, and they got trench foot,

1164
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:10,200
 their feet swelled up in the cold.

1165
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:11,320
 The clothing was completely awful.

1166
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:13,020
 Sometimes the sole of their shoe would just stick

1167
00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:15,320
 to the mud as they lifted their foot up,

1168
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:16,720
 and the rest of the shoe came,

1169
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:18,400
 and the sole was left behind,

1170
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:20,120
 'cause the mud was very thick and sticky.

1171
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:20,960
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1172
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:22,240
 - Really bad, yeah, yeah.

1173
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:23,960
 They had a horrible time.

1174
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:25,560
 - Yeah, it was a tough one.

1175
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:26,640
 - It was a tough war.

1176
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:27,480
 - Oh.

1177
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:28,320
 - It was many of them are.

1178
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:30,040
 - What were the years, the Crimean War?

1179
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:32,320
 - 1853 to six.

1180
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:33,160
 - Yeah, as Anna said.

1181
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:34,000
 - Three to six.

1182
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:34,840
 - Three to six.

1183
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:35,660
 - Three to six.

1184
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:36,500
 - Three to six, yeah.

1185
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:37,720
 - 1853 to six.

1186
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:38,560
 - Yeah.

1187
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:39,400
 - Sorry.

1188
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:40,220
 - Right.

1189
00:36:40,220 --> 00:36:42,040
 - And it was a very complicated war.

1190
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:45,240
 - Yeah, it was basically a blue sash orange

1191
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:48,400
 about the West trying to limit Russian expansionism,

1192
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:49,240
 wasn't it?

1193
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:50,920
 - It's basically the Ottomans coming up

1194
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:54,360
 to the North, the Russians coming out to the West,

1195
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:56,720
 Britain and France having colonial things

1196
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:58,480
 that they didn't want to lose,

1197
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:00,600
 trying to keep Russia as quiet as possible,

1198
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:03,600
 and decided to get on the side of the Ottomans,

1199
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:06,760
 and then attack the underbelly, which is Crimea.

1200
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:07,600
 - Yeah.

1201
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,000
 - And also there were a lot of Ottomans

1202
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,280
 living in Crimea at the time,

1203
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:12,280
 so it was a bit of a powder keg anyway.

1204
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:14,680
 - It was a very, very complicated situation.

1205
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:16,360
 Anyway, it started over rights of access

1206
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:18,880
 to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem,

1207
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:19,960
 which I think we talked about.

1208
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:21,840
 Isn't that the one where they have the disagreement

1209
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:22,680
 over the ladder?

1210
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:23,520
 - It is.

1211
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:24,360
 - Yeah.

1212
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:25,560
 - And this was the same thing, basically.

1213
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:27,480
 The Ottoman Sultan gave the Catholic priests

1214
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:29,440
 a key to the Church in 1852.

1215
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:31,240
 And from that point on, you know, it was like,

1216
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:33,080
 well, we have to have a war over this.

1217
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:34,720
 Basically things escalated from there.

1218
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:35,880
 And then suddenly you have got the charge

1219
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:36,720
 of the Light Brigade happening,

1220
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:38,000
 and it's all going disastrously wrong.

1221
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:38,840
 - Yeah.

1222
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:39,880
 - And Florence Nightingale's having to organize

1223
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:40,720
 a lot of stuff.

1224
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:42,560
 - I mean, lots of famous things came from it, I suppose.

1225
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:44,200
 Florence Nightingale, Mary Seacull,

1226
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:45,360
 charge of the Light Brigade.

1227
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:46,640
 - Three items of clothing.

1228
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:50,240
 Balaklava, the cardigan.

1229
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:51,640
 - Cardigan, Earl of Cardigan,

1230
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:53,240
 very heavily involved in the Light Brigade.

1231
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:54,320
 - It's gotta be a boot.

1232
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:55,440
 - You're not gonna get it.

1233
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:56,280
 - Go on, what is it?

1234
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:57,560
 - The Sebastopol hat.

1235
00:37:57,560 --> 00:37:59,840
 (laughing)

1236
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:02,240
 - It's the Raglan sleeve shirt.

1237
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:03,560
 - What's that?

1238
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:04,800
 - It's got a different color of,

1239
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,880
 the torso is a different color to the sleeves.

1240
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:08,320
 It's a baseball jersey.

1241
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:12,000
 But General Fitzroy Somerset, the first Baron Raglan,

1242
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,400
 was not wearing a baseball jersey,

1243
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:15,160
 but it didn't have a Raglan sleeve shirt named after him.

1244
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:16,720
 And he was the one who was responsible

1245
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:18,520
 for the charge of the Light Brigade going so badly wrong.

1246
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:19,360
 - Right.

1247
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:20,440
 - He was very old and he was half deaf

1248
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:22,280
 and he was not really with it.

1249
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:24,440
 And he said, oh, the Russians are taking some guns over there.

1250
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:26,360
 Can you go and stop them taking away the guns?

1251
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:28,880
 And the order was then carried to someone else,

1252
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:30,040
 the Earl of Cardigan,

1253
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:31,400
 who could not see the guns

1254
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:32,680
 'cause he was somewhere completely different.

1255
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:33,920
 And he said, well, those guns,

1256
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:36,920
 and pointed at this incredibly well-defended gun in place,

1257
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:38,760
 but at the end of a long, narrow valley,

1258
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:40,800
 just a disastrous place to attack.

1259
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:44,880
 And he said, okay, this isn't gonna go well,

1260
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:45,800
 but fine.

1261
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:47,120
 - Don Yacardi's.

1262
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:47,960
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1263
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:48,800
 Here's the exact words where,

1264
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:50,200
 here goes the last of the Brudenells

1265
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:51,640
 'cause he thought he was just riding straight

1266
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:54,960
 to a certain death as a lot of the people in that charge were.

1267
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:57,160
 - Here's another thing that wasn't invented,

1268
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:59,440
 but someone tried to invent for the Crimea,

1269
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:03,320
 which was a entire city destroying cannon.

1270
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:04,880
 This is a massive cannon.

1271
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:06,240
 It was 10 meters wide.

1272
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:07,720
 The shot is 10 meters wide.

1273
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:08,560
 - No.

1274
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:10,560
 - And it would weigh 550 tons.

1275
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:12,040
 And the idea is that once it landed,

1276
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:14,160
 it would demolish an entire city.

1277
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:16,920
 And it was to be called the Saxo Cannon.

1278
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:19,320
 - How are they gonna transport that anywhere?

1279
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:20,160
 - Yeah.

1280
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:23,720
 - It's a wacky racer's Acme Roadrunner-style cannon,

1281
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:24,560
 they're making.

1282
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:25,560
 - The inventor was a solid inventor.

1283
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:26,640
 - Was it not Adolf Sax?

1284
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:30,160
 - It was, the inventor of the saxophone came up

1285
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:32,040
 with a city destroying cannon,

1286
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:33,440
 which he really wanted to build.

1287
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:34,560
 - He was such a weird guy.

1288
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:35,760
 He would just invent these things

1289
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:38,400
 and then just call it the Sax something.

1290
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:39,240
 - Exactly.

1291
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:40,640
 - So never, it didn't take off.

1292
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:42,920
 - No, didn't get past the planning stages.

1293
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:43,740
 - No.

1294
00:39:43,740 --> 00:39:44,580
 - That's what we wanted to do.

1295
00:39:44,580 --> 00:39:46,160
 - Take off, very nice.

1296
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:50,800
 - Something else the Chromium War gave us is,

1297
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:52,640
 I think the earliest war photography,

1298
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:54,800
 or some of the earliest war photography,

1299
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:58,600
 very famous photo of the Valley of the Shadow of Death

1300
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:00,640
 by Roger Fenton in 1855.

1301
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:02,680
 I think it's one of the earliest pictures of warfare.

1302
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:03,880
 Basically, there are two photos

1303
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:05,400
 of the Valley of the Shadow of Death.

1304
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:08,720
 And they're both of this extremely barren landscape,

1305
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:10,560
 very near where the Charger Library was,

1306
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:14,360
 and gravel, little valley slopes on each side.

1307
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:16,160
 One of them has some cannonballs on the floor,

1308
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:17,200
 one of them doesn't,

1309
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:19,640
 and the famous one is the one with the cannonballs.

1310
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:22,120
 And it's the, you know, sort of tragedy of war

1311
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:25,080
 and the emptiness of the landscape with these war weapons.

1312
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:28,960
 But there's been so much debate over the last 150 years

1313
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:30,120
 over whether he faked it.

1314
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:31,880
 Like, where did the cannonballs come from?

1315
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:34,680
 - Well, Sax, I think, prototypes.

1316
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:36,320
 (all laughing)

1317
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:37,920
 - His marbles, weren't they?

1318
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:40,240
 (all laughing)

1319
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:41,240
 And we don't know, 'cause it might be

1320
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:43,440
 that the second photo is after they'd cleared it up.

1321
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:45,160
 So then they just took another one of it clean.

1322
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:46,840
 - Right, or he might have deposited.

1323
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:47,680
 Ooh, tricky.

1324
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:49,600
 - The thing was, 'cause he took a lot of photos, right?

1325
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:51,120
 He had a horse and carriage with him,

1326
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:54,680
 which was like a portable photo developing booth

1327
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:55,960
 that he had with him.

1328
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:58,000
 He had lots of glass slides that he had

1329
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,480
 with him, multiple cameras.

1330
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:01,800
 And everyone's saying, oh, he staged a lot of photos.

1331
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:04,600
 I think it's more than just the cannonball one.

1332
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:07,680
 And the problem is, of course, they were staged.

1333
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:09,440
 Everything had to be staged.

1334
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:10,840
 - 'Cause you needed a long exposure time.

1335
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:12,560
 - The exposure was like 30 seconds.

1336
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:14,080
 - It's actually why the charge of the labricade

1337
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:15,880
 was such a disastrous, 'cause they had to wait

1338
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:17,920
 for half a minute for the photo.

1339
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:19,480
 The team photo at the start.

1340
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:20,800
 - And someone was blinking.

1341
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:22,280
 (all laughing)

1342
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:24,860
 (upbeat music)

1343
00:41:24,860 --> 00:41:29,960
 - Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show,

1344
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:31,560
 and that is Andy.

1345
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:34,080
 - My fact is, there is a chameleon in Madagascar,

1346
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:38,600
 which is effectively extinct for several months every year.

1347
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:41,040
 This fact is incredible.

1348
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:41,880
 - It's insane.

1349
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:42,720
 - Yeah, it's really good.

1350
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:43,560
 - I think it's not true.

1351
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:46,200
 I think if you're extinct, come back three months later,

1352
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:47,040
 you're not extinct.

1353
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:48,040
 - Let's debate the case.

1354
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:49,520
 (all laughing)

1355
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:51,360
 And first of all, thanks to Kate Wood,

1356
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:54,440
 who sent us in, in the email, "the fish in the box."

1357
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:56,600
 - If I knew it was from you, as opposed to Andy,

1358
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:57,760
 I wouldn't have poo pooed it.

1359
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:58,640
 - No, no, no.

1360
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:02,720
 This is the Labord's chameleon, and it is crazy.

1361
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:05,840
 Right, so, November, the chameleon hatches out.

1362
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:06,680
 - Yes.

1363
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:09,360
 - In Madagascar, in the forest.

1364
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:11,640
 Then they grow to sexual maturity very fast.

1365
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:15,640
 In about two months, they are grown up, ready to breed.

1366
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:18,480
 They breed, the females lay some eggs in the ground.

1367
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:20,760
 Then in March, they all die.

1368
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:21,600
 - Not the eggs, the adults.

1369
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:23,040
 - All the adults die.

1370
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:26,080
 There are then, the entire species exists in egg form,

1371
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:28,240
 basically, for most of the year.

1372
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:30,720
 In November, eggs hatch out, on they go.

1373
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:34,120
 - It's so weird, it's so weird, for most of the year,

1374
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:35,320
 yeah, they're not extinct exactly,

1375
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:37,920
 but for most of the year, the species lives in,

1376
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:38,760
 as an egg.

1377
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:41,160
 - Must be weird for the first person to come out of the egg.

1378
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:42,000
 - Yeah.

1379
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:42,820
 - Every year.

1380
00:42:42,820 --> 00:42:43,660
 - Oh my God, yeah.

1381
00:42:43,660 --> 00:42:45,680
 - They learn nothing from their elders?

1382
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:46,640
 I just think these are bizarre.

1383
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:48,360
 These were discovered in 2008.

1384
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:50,320
 I think their life cycle was first reported.

1385
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:51,720
 I think since then, they have found that

1386
00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:53,360
 if you keep some in captivity,

1387
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:55,200
 or maybe under very specific conditions,

1388
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:57,040
 one might make it through a year.

1389
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:58,360
 But it's really, really rare.

1390
00:42:58,360 --> 00:42:59,200
 So it's--

1391
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:00,880
 - What a year 2008 was.

1392
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:03,080
 Over in India, you had someone being killed on TV

1393
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:05,720
 with mind power, or not, or not.

1394
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:06,560
 - In Iraq.

1395
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:08,720
 - You had a chameleon being extinct, or not.

1396
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:11,300
 - In Iraq, George Bush is getting a tooth run at him.

1397
00:43:11,300 --> 00:43:12,140
 - Wow.

1398
00:43:12,140 --> 00:43:12,960
 - What?

1399
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:14,360
 - What was Anthony Trollup doing that year?

1400
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:16,400
 (all laughing)

1401
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:17,920
 - No, and they're amazing.

1402
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:20,720
 And I think it's 'cause they die to avoid the dry season,

1403
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:23,600
 which is very harsh and very, very hot in Madagascar.

1404
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:26,240
 And they just, some species hibernate,

1405
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:27,960
 they just decide to die.

1406
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:29,360
 And lots of chameleons on Madagascar,

1407
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:31,400
 I think they've got about--

1408
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:32,480
 - They've got almost half, haven't they?

1409
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:34,240
 - Almost half, what's the percentage of something?

1410
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:35,080
 - Yeah.

1411
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:36,400
 - Extraordinary variety of estimates

1412
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:38,040
 as to the number of chameleon species.

1413
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:40,720
 Given that it feels like a very small, countable number,

1414
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:43,160
 I read anywhere, and all from very reputable sources,

1415
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:48,000
 anywhere between 134 and more than 217 species of chameleon.

1416
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,080
 - Well, they're different colors, aren't they?

1417
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:50,080
 It's very hard to tell, you know?

1418
00:43:50,080 --> 00:43:50,920
 - Yeah, yeah, that's a good point.

1419
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:52,280
 - Well, this was a green one before.

1420
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:53,120
 (all laughing)

1421
00:43:53,120 --> 00:43:55,340
 Or is it a different one?

1422
00:43:55,340 --> 00:43:56,180
 - They're great.

1423
00:43:56,180 --> 00:43:57,800
 - Yeah, they don't change their color to match their background.

1424
00:43:57,800 --> 00:43:58,840
 I actually didn't know that

1425
00:43:58,840 --> 00:44:01,080
 until reading it for this podcast.

1426
00:44:01,080 --> 00:44:01,920
 - Right.

1427
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:02,760
 - They change their emotions.

1428
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:04,760
 - Yeah, no, I think that's amazing.

1429
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:06,600
 An amazing misconception.

1430
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:08,720
 It's one of the biggest ones we've debunked on QI.

1431
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:10,760
 You know, sometimes we debunk things that you think,

1432
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:12,160
 yeah, come on, that's a bit.

1433
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:13,160
 - No, we never do that.

1434
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:15,160
 - No, we never do that, we never do that.

1435
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:16,520
 - There's an amazing thing.

1436
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:20,840
 If you were watching the UFC of chameleon battles, right?

1437
00:44:20,840 --> 00:44:22,880
 Two competitors enter the ring.

1438
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:25,360
 If you were betting, you could probably bet

1439
00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:27,840
 in the last few seconds, if that was allowed,

1440
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:29,400
 on who was gonna win.

1441
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:31,200
 - Do they change color based on whether they think

1442
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:32,040
 they're gonna win or lose?

1443
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:33,960
 - When they pass each other in the street,

1444
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:37,040
 two males were often changed colors to sort of be like,

1445
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:39,120
 kind of like if you're walking poolside

1446
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:42,520
 and you tuck your tummy in and walk in that kind of thing.

1447
00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:46,040
 So yeah, so they found when they were studying it

1448
00:44:46,040 --> 00:44:48,840
 that the chameleon that was brighter

1449
00:44:48,840 --> 00:44:52,440
 and changed more rapidly was the one who was gonna win.

1450
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:54,200
 And they just found that that on average

1451
00:44:54,200 --> 00:44:55,320
 was the way that it happened.

1452
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:56,640
 Yeah, or above average.

1453
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:58,840
 - So what a useful way, if only we could tell them that,

1454
00:44:58,840 --> 00:45:00,120
 then they never have to fight, right?

1455
00:45:00,120 --> 00:45:01,240
 - They can always just go up to each other and go.

1456
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:02,080
 - Stop the match.

1457
00:45:02,080 --> 00:45:02,920
 - Oh, okay.

1458
00:45:02,920 --> 00:45:04,240
 - Throw the towel in, yeah.

1459
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:05,080
 - Exactly.

1460
00:45:05,080 --> 00:45:05,920
 - Wow.

1461
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:08,040
 - If you were a chameleon in a boxing ring or something,

1462
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:09,400
 'cause you normally wear a little dressing gown,

1463
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:10,840
 don't you, into the ring.

1464
00:45:10,840 --> 00:45:12,360
 And as soon as you take your dressing gown off,

1465
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:13,960
 you look down, you were confident

1466
00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:16,520
 until you saw how bright and stripy the other guy is.

1467
00:45:16,520 --> 00:45:17,360
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1468
00:45:17,360 --> 00:45:19,520
 - I should just quickly say, this was in 2013,

1469
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:21,720
 it was a guy called Russell Ligon and Kevin McGrew,

1470
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:23,960
 and they did 45 encounters that they monitored.

1471
00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:25,280
 And that's what they discovered from it.

1472
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:26,120
 - That's very cool.

1473
00:45:26,120 --> 00:45:26,960
 - Yeah.

1474
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:28,560
 - They've got amazing anatomy.

1475
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:31,480
 I didn't know about the shape of their feet at all.

1476
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:32,320
 And they are bizarre.

1477
00:45:32,320 --> 00:45:34,840
 They are described often as looking like salad tongs.

1478
00:45:34,840 --> 00:45:35,680
 - Oh, yeah.

1479
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:36,520
 - And they do.

1480
00:45:36,520 --> 00:45:39,960
 So there are two pads opposite each other.

1481
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:44,400
 And in fact, they're the only animals who aren't birds,

1482
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:47,080
 who are zygodactylists,

1483
00:45:47,080 --> 00:45:50,640
 which basically means that they have three fingers,

1484
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:52,840
 opposite two fingers in a certain way.

1485
00:45:52,840 --> 00:45:54,760
 And they're not the same kind of zygodactylists,

1486
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:55,760
 really, as birds.

1487
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:57,200
 They're their own special thing.

1488
00:45:57,200 --> 00:45:58,440
 And essentially it's to grip trees.

1489
00:45:58,440 --> 00:46:00,120
 I don't know why more things don't have this.

1490
00:46:00,120 --> 00:46:02,440
 So it looks like a sideways claw

1491
00:46:02,440 --> 00:46:04,160
 that just clamps onto trees.

1492
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:05,280
 It's very clever.

1493
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:07,400
 But I did find out that you can also get

1494
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:12,400
 pamperodactyly, anisodactyly, and schizo-dactylies as well,

1495
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:15,760
 which are in primate schizo-dactylies,

1496
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:18,360
 grasped with their second and third digits.

1497
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:19,880
 What's we're doing instead of thumb and finger?

1498
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:22,640
 - Like doing scissors for a rock paper scissors.

1499
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:23,800
 - Exactly.

1500
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:26,520
 - Does that free you up to hold something, like food?

1501
00:46:26,520 --> 00:46:28,600
 - Or do you like a thumbs up at the same time

1502
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:29,760
 as holding onto the tree?

1503
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:31,360
 - I think that's the idea, yeah.

1504
00:46:31,360 --> 00:46:32,240
 - And you can hold a can of paper

1505
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:33,480
 between fingers four and five.

1506
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:34,840
 - Yeah, perfect.

1507
00:46:34,840 --> 00:46:36,960
 - No, they are, they're great.

1508
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:38,640
 I know someone who's got a peck of media.

1509
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:39,480
 - Do you?

1510
00:46:39,480 --> 00:46:40,320
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1511
00:46:40,320 --> 00:46:42,880
 - Is that the end of the Alec Dope?

1512
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:44,000
 - I think it is.

1513
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:47,840
 - I'm rummaging for more, but that really is about it.

1514
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:48,840
 It's called Roy.

1515
00:46:48,840 --> 00:46:50,720
 - Oh, there was more, there was more.

1516
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:54,360
 - No, and that's the end of the Alec Dope, yeah.

1517
00:46:54,360 --> 00:46:56,600
 - If you were sitting on a chameleon's tongue

1518
00:46:56,600 --> 00:46:58,600
 when it ate something.

1519
00:46:58,600 --> 00:46:59,440
 - Food for thought, yeah.

1520
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:02,000
 - You would die so badly.

1521
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,440
 - No, no, it would just not be able to eat anything

1522
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:06,680
 because you're way bigger than a chameleon.

1523
00:47:06,680 --> 00:47:08,520
 If you're sitting on its tongue,

1524
00:47:08,520 --> 00:47:10,080
 it's not gonna be eating anything.

1525
00:47:10,080 --> 00:47:11,200
 - Sorry, you're right.

1526
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:13,160
 You have to imagine that you're the size of a borrower

1527
00:47:13,160 --> 00:47:14,240
 or maybe even smaller.

1528
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:15,080
 - Oh, okay.

1529
00:47:15,080 --> 00:47:15,920
 - Of an ant.

1530
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:16,760
 Oh yeah, sorry.

1531
00:47:16,760 --> 00:47:18,240
 Well, we'll see if you sit on a chameleon's tongue,

1532
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:20,600
 it'll just crush its tongue because you're human size.

1533
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:22,200
 - No, but like, you know, if something bites you,

1534
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:23,040
 a bite could have venom

1535
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:24,920
 and I thought the reveal was gonna be the tongue would.

1536
00:47:24,920 --> 00:47:25,760
 - Sorry, it wasn't.

1537
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:27,120
 It was the acceleration of their tongues.

1538
00:47:27,120 --> 00:47:28,840
 I should have made clear that you've been shrunken

1539
00:47:28,840 --> 00:47:30,160
 like honey eye shots with kids in this.

1540
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:32,120
 - Yeah, I think that was a big central bit of that story.

1541
00:47:32,120 --> 00:47:32,960
 - It was.

1542
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:34,080
 - Yeah, Anna, you've clasped at this one.

1543
00:47:34,080 --> 00:47:34,920
 This is it.

1544
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:35,760
 (laughing)

1545
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:37,080
 - Should I?

1546
00:47:37,080 --> 00:47:39,080
 If you were really, really small

1547
00:47:39,080 --> 00:47:41,120
 and you were sitting on a chameleon's tongue

1548
00:47:41,120 --> 00:47:43,440
 and it stuck it out, then you would definitely die.

1549
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:45,880
 The acceleration of their tongues are amazing.

1550
00:47:45,880 --> 00:47:47,760
 They're actually the highest acceleration

1551
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:50,560
 and power output, like amount of power generated

1552
00:47:50,560 --> 00:47:53,240
 for any movement of a reptile, bird, or mammal.

1553
00:47:53,240 --> 00:47:54,280
 - It is the same.

1554
00:47:54,280 --> 00:47:55,120
 - Yeah.

1555
00:47:55,120 --> 00:47:58,120
 - The power output is 14,000 watts per kilogram.

1556
00:47:58,120 --> 00:47:58,960
 - Incredible.

1557
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:02,200
 - Okay, now, Jonas Fingard or Tade Pagaccia

1558
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:05,240
 who are the best cyclists in the world in the Tour de France

1559
00:48:05,240 --> 00:48:07,520
 say if they're going up a mountain,

1560
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:11,000
 they can max out at about seven watts per kilogram

1561
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:14,480
 and these guys are doing 14,000 watts per kilogram.

1562
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:15,800
 - It's a lot.

1563
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:17,160
 - I almost can't compute that.

1564
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:18,000
 That's amazing.

1565
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:21,400
 - It's like, so the G-force is, I think,

1566
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:22,880
 the maximum G-force we can survive

1567
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:25,520
 is maybe nine or 10 for a few seconds by the pilots

1568
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:28,280
 and the G-force on their tongue would be 264 G.

1569
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:29,120
 - Okay.

1570
00:48:29,120 --> 00:48:30,920
 (laughing)

1571
00:48:30,920 --> 00:48:32,920
 - Your face is being distorted by that.

1572
00:48:32,920 --> 00:48:34,800
 - That is so cool.

1573
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:37,720
 I did read a bit about what's inside their tongue

1574
00:48:37,720 --> 00:48:38,760
 'cause they have these things called

1575
00:48:38,760 --> 00:48:41,000
 intralingual sheaths, right?

1576
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,400
 So the tongue has bones running along the core of it,

1577
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:44,480
 which is weird in itself.

1578
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:46,320
 I guess they don't, not very big bones,

1579
00:48:46,320 --> 00:48:48,880
 but those are covered by these intralingual sheaths

1580
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:51,640
 and those are covered by an accelerator muscle

1581
00:48:51,640 --> 00:48:52,800
 and what the chameleon does is

1582
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:54,720
 the chameleon spring loads the sheaths

1583
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:57,080
 and packs them into each other like a telescope.

1584
00:48:57,080 --> 00:48:58,640
 - That's like, there was a toy that used to do that

1585
00:48:58,640 --> 00:49:00,120
 that you flicked it when you were younger

1586
00:49:00,120 --> 00:49:03,320
 and it was telescopic and they expanded out, wasn't there?

1587
00:49:03,320 --> 00:49:04,320
 I've got a real memory of that.

1588
00:49:04,320 --> 00:49:05,160
 - I don't remember that.

1589
00:49:05,160 --> 00:49:07,040
 - I was just playing with the chameleon's tongue

1590
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:07,880
 when I was younger.

1591
00:49:07,880 --> 00:49:10,240
 - You would get like those pointers that teachers had

1592
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:11,560
 and they would go like that, wouldn't they?

1593
00:49:11,560 --> 00:49:12,400
 - Yes.

1594
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:14,120
 - I got one of those last year.

1595
00:49:14,120 --> 00:49:14,960
 - For Christmas.

1596
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:17,920
 - I got one myself at a non-holiday time

1597
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:19,520
 and God, they're good.

1598
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:20,360
 - Yeah.

1599
00:49:20,360 --> 00:49:21,200
 - The pointers.

1600
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:23,760
 - Do you just point at stuff?

1601
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:24,600
 - Yeah.

1602
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:26,680
 - Just walk down the street going, there's a fancy tree.

1603
00:49:26,680 --> 00:49:30,120
 - It really, it gives you a kind of authority

1604
00:49:30,120 --> 00:49:33,080
 that is extraordinary, you know.

1605
00:49:33,080 --> 00:49:34,560
 - You've never dared use it here.

1606
00:49:34,560 --> 00:49:36,520
 - No, no, no, but if I'm in the supermarket

1607
00:49:36,520 --> 00:49:38,640
 and I want to put it something on the conveyor belt

1608
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:42,000
 and say, make sure you apply the discount on that radish,

1609
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:42,840
 my good man.

1610
00:49:42,840 --> 00:49:44,840
 - I'm gonna bleep this one next.

1611
00:49:44,840 --> 00:49:48,840
 - I'm so confused about why you asked people what it is.

1612
00:49:48,840 --> 00:49:52,400
 - I'm so confused because all of this sounds so plausible.

1613
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:53,240
 - Yeah.

1614
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:54,080
 - We're just missing the one detail.

1615
00:49:54,080 --> 00:49:57,440
 - We're sort of playing what I like you now, aren't we?

1616
00:49:57,440 --> 00:49:59,200
 No, I think it was a couple of years ago.

1617
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:00,520
 I bought it for a show.

1618
00:50:00,520 --> 00:50:02,120
 But I cannot remember the context in which I have

1619
00:50:02,120 --> 00:50:03,160
 and I've just ended up with a pointer,

1620
00:50:03,160 --> 00:50:04,560
 which I'd love to get out occasionally.

1621
00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:05,640
 - That's right.

1622
00:50:05,640 --> 00:50:07,320
 - So chameleon saliva.

1623
00:50:07,320 --> 00:50:09,200
 This was another fact in the inbox actually.

1624
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:11,120
 So not only did Kate Wood send the original fact,

1625
00:50:11,120 --> 00:50:12,920
 that Robert Harding writes,

1626
00:50:12,920 --> 00:50:15,080
 chameleon saliva is the opposite of custard.

1627
00:50:15,080 --> 00:50:18,800
 - It's disgusting on treacle time.

1628
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:22,480
 Is that 'cause it's non-Newtonian, but in a different way?

1629
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:23,600
 - Bingo.

1630
00:50:23,600 --> 00:50:24,440
 - Yes.

1631
00:50:24,440 --> 00:50:26,880
 - So custard, if you run across custard,

1632
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:29,640
 as you apply force to it, it gets harder.

1633
00:50:29,640 --> 00:50:30,720
 - Very good.

1634
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:33,000
 That's it, it thickens on impact.

1635
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:36,080
 A chameleon saliva is thick in the mouth,

1636
00:50:36,080 --> 00:50:38,440
 but when the tongue strikes the insect

1637
00:50:38,440 --> 00:50:40,040
 it's trying to eat or whatever,

1638
00:50:40,040 --> 00:50:43,360
 that blob becomes very malleable for an instant.

1639
00:50:43,360 --> 00:50:44,200
 - That's clever.

1640
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:45,360
 - And then hardens right again.

1641
00:50:45,360 --> 00:50:46,200
 - Right.

1642
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:48,360
 - So the prey is then glued to the tongue

1643
00:50:48,360 --> 00:50:51,520
 and then it gets pulled right back into the chameleon's mouth.

1644
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:52,360
 - That's clever.

1645
00:50:52,360 --> 00:50:53,200
 - Isn't that amazing?

1646
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:54,920
 - I found a chameleon who was a chameleon

1647
00:50:54,920 --> 00:50:56,680
 before chameleons were chameleons.

1648
00:50:56,680 --> 00:50:57,520
 - What?

1649
00:50:57,520 --> 00:50:58,360
 - Keep talking.

1650
00:50:58,360 --> 00:50:59,200
 - Keep talking.

1651
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:00,040
 - I got a headache.

1652
00:51:00,040 --> 00:51:02,520
 You know I got a headache and this is not helping.

1653
00:51:02,520 --> 00:51:04,600
 - There used to be a philosopher called chameleon.

1654
00:51:04,600 --> 00:51:05,440
 - Really?

1655
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:06,680
 - He was a disciple of Aristotle.

1656
00:51:06,680 --> 00:51:09,240
 - Was he the guy who came up with the idea of karma?

1657
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:13,000
 (laughing)

1658
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,000
 - He, we don't know anything about him.

1659
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:16,320
 - He's just gonna go straight up.

1660
00:51:16,320 --> 00:51:18,760
 - I'm just, you're ill, you don't know what you're saying.

1661
00:51:18,760 --> 00:51:22,240
 It's just helping you out here.

1662
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:24,120
 Yeah, no, he is a disciple.

1663
00:51:24,120 --> 00:51:25,600
 We know virtually nothing about him,

1664
00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:27,440
 I guess with us, as with a lot of people then,

1665
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:29,080
 but he did write a lot of pieces

1666
00:51:29,080 --> 00:51:31,040
 that we do know of his names attached to,

1667
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:33,360
 like a piece called "On Drunkenness",

1668
00:51:33,360 --> 00:51:35,320
 a piece called "On Pleasure",

1669
00:51:35,320 --> 00:51:36,520
 but virtually nothing is known.

1670
00:51:36,520 --> 00:51:41,360
 But so he lived, he would have died in 281 BC

1671
00:51:41,360 --> 00:51:43,560
 and the word chameleon came about

1672
00:51:43,560 --> 00:51:46,560
 in roughly the 14th century, mid-14th century.

1673
00:51:46,560 --> 00:51:48,080
 - Okay, interesting.

1674
00:51:48,080 --> 00:51:49,200
 - To describe the lizard, presumably.

1675
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:50,920
 - To describe the lizard and what's interesting is,

1676
00:51:50,920 --> 00:51:52,720
 Aristotle wrote about chameleons,

1677
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:53,960
 but we just didn't have the word

1678
00:51:53,960 --> 00:51:55,400
 and he wasn't writing about his mate.

1679
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:56,440
 - So did he always have to say,

1680
00:51:56,440 --> 00:51:58,600
 "You know that thing that kind of changes color,

1681
00:51:58,600 --> 00:52:00,440
 "looks a bit like a gecko?"

1682
00:52:00,440 --> 00:52:03,000
 - Looks like my mate, my disciples, yeah.

1683
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,120
 - Can I give you some animals

1684
00:52:05,120 --> 00:52:06,320
 that were thought to be extinct,

1685
00:52:06,320 --> 00:52:07,160
 but then aren't.

1686
00:52:07,160 --> 00:52:08,500
 - Yes.

1687
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:10,800
 - The Canterbury, Nobdweevil.

1688
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:11,640
 - Okay.

1689
00:52:11,640 --> 00:52:13,200
 (laughing)

1690
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:15,240
 - I might just stop there actually.

1691
00:52:15,240 --> 00:52:16,400
 - No, more, more!

1692
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:18,600
 - The cloaked bee, the dinosaur ant,

1693
00:52:18,600 --> 00:52:21,520
 the terrace skink, the Batman river loach,

1694
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:24,160
 the painted frog, and the Machu Picchu,

1695
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:26,720
 arboreal chinchilla rat,

1696
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:29,200
 which was found in a tree near Machu Picchu.

1697
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:30,040
 - Right.

1698
00:52:30,040 --> 00:52:31,600
 - When they un-extincted it.

1699
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:32,440
 - Wow.

1700
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:33,800
 - So these are just all things,

1701
00:52:33,800 --> 00:52:36,000
 was there one big find, one day out,

1702
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:37,320
 where they're just all hanging out

1703
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:40,040
 in the same playing cards for a while?

1704
00:52:40,040 --> 00:52:41,880
 - It's some sort of like support group

1705
00:52:41,880 --> 00:52:45,080
 for the extinct who aren't extinct, yeah.

1706
00:52:45,080 --> 00:52:47,560
 - There's also the Confusing Rocket Frog.

1707
00:52:47,560 --> 00:52:48,760
 - That's a great name.

1708
00:52:48,760 --> 00:52:51,440
 - And they found it in 2019,

1709
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:53,440
 and it's called Confusing because it looks a lot

1710
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:56,160
 like other frogs, but it's the Confusing Rocket Frog.

1711
00:52:56,160 --> 00:52:57,640
 And the interesting thing about this is,

1712
00:52:57,640 --> 00:53:00,320
 it was thought to be extinct in 1985.

1713
00:53:00,320 --> 00:53:02,960
 They found it in 2019, but luckily it was in a place

1714
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:04,960
 where they were about to do loads of mining

1715
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:06,240
 and logging and stuff like that,

1716
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:08,040
 and it meant that they couldn't do any of it.

1717
00:53:08,040 --> 00:53:08,880
 - Brilliant.

1718
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:09,720
 - I think it's in Ecuador.

1719
00:53:09,720 --> 00:53:10,560
 - That's great.

1720
00:53:10,560 --> 00:53:11,560
 - Well done, Little Rocket Frog.

1721
00:53:11,560 --> 00:53:13,120
 - The Painted Frog, was that one that you said?

1722
00:53:13,120 --> 00:53:14,600
 - Painted Frog, yeah.

1723
00:53:14,600 --> 00:53:16,320
 - Which just sounds like someone forcing

1724
00:53:16,320 --> 00:53:18,280
 chameleonism onto animals.

1725
00:53:18,280 --> 00:53:19,920
 (all laughing)

1726
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:20,920
 - That's very interesting.

1727
00:53:20,920 --> 00:53:22,720
 - There's a type of fish that was thought

1728
00:53:22,720 --> 00:53:25,160
 to have gone extinct 66 million years ago,

1729
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:27,920
 and then it was found in 1938.

1730
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:29,200
 And it's the Sealocanth.

1731
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:32,360
 And do you know the story of how it was rediscovered?

1732
00:53:32,360 --> 00:53:33,200
 - Is it?

1733
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:34,040
 - It's so cool.

1734
00:53:34,040 --> 00:53:34,880
 - Was it in 1938?

1735
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:36,680
 Was it found by a submarine?

1736
00:53:36,680 --> 00:53:40,600
 - No, no, just found by a normal fisherman in South Africa,

1737
00:53:40,600 --> 00:53:42,440
 caught a weird fish, got back,

1738
00:53:42,440 --> 00:53:44,600
 gave it to this woman who ran the museum,

1739
00:53:44,600 --> 00:53:46,120
 who thought that's weird.

1740
00:53:46,120 --> 00:53:47,280
 So she sketched it.

1741
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:48,120
 - Oh, I remember, yay.

1742
00:53:48,120 --> 00:53:50,080
 - It's amazing, so she sketched it,

1743
00:53:50,080 --> 00:53:52,080
 and she sent it to Professor Smith,

1744
00:53:52,080 --> 00:53:54,240
 who she knew would be able to tell her what it was.

1745
00:53:54,240 --> 00:53:57,200
 Professor Smith received her sketch, no straight away.

1746
00:53:57,200 --> 00:53:58,040
 This is the Sealocanth.

1747
00:53:58,040 --> 00:54:00,920
 It's been 66 million years, we thought it was gone.

1748
00:54:00,920 --> 00:54:03,160
 And he goes and he visits it,

1749
00:54:03,160 --> 00:54:05,400
 but it's kind of disintegrated by that point.

1750
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:07,800
 So he can't confirm really that lots about it,

1751
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:08,760
 or where it came from.

1752
00:54:08,760 --> 00:54:11,240
 And he devoted the next 14 years

1753
00:54:11,240 --> 00:54:14,000
 to finding a second specimen.

1754
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:15,360
 He was desperate.

1755
00:54:15,360 --> 00:54:18,160
 And eventually there was a guy on the,

1756
00:54:18,160 --> 00:54:21,800
 one of the Comoros Islands off Mozambique in 1952,

1757
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:22,960
 who found one.

1758
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:26,200
 And Smith was managed to convince the South African government

1759
00:54:26,200 --> 00:54:28,920
 to get a military plane to fly him

1760
00:54:28,920 --> 00:54:30,840
 to off the coast of Mozambique.

1761
00:54:30,840 --> 00:54:33,080
 He had to have a conversation with the Mozambique authorities,

1762
00:54:33,080 --> 00:54:34,880
 saying, "Hey, we're flying military planes

1763
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:36,760
 "over your airspace, really sorry."

1764
00:54:36,760 --> 00:54:38,360
 They were like, "Why are you doing that?"

1765
00:54:38,360 --> 00:54:40,200
 They said, "We're just going to pick up a fish."

1766
00:54:40,200 --> 00:54:41,720
 - I remember reading that story,

1767
00:54:41,720 --> 00:54:44,720
 and I think the woman who found it in the first place

1768
00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:46,760
 and knew there was something up,

1769
00:54:46,760 --> 00:54:49,000
 I think it was either Smith or someone else said

1770
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,320
 it was evidence of women's intuition.

1771
00:54:51,320 --> 00:54:53,560
 The greatest evidence we ever had of women's intuition.

1772
00:54:53,560 --> 00:54:54,400
 - Really?

1773
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:55,760
 Marjorie Courtney Lassmer, really?

1774
00:54:55,760 --> 00:54:57,040
 - That's what I said, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1775
00:54:57,040 --> 00:54:58,920
 - What, just 'cause she sensed that this is a weird...

1776
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:00,480
 - She just knew there was something going on.

1777
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:02,120
 - Yeah. - Wow.

1778
00:55:02,120 --> 00:55:03,960
 - Just proving two things with one fish,

1779
00:55:03,960 --> 00:55:05,480
 that's pretty cool.

1780
00:55:05,480 --> 00:55:06,560
 Not only do we have the fish,

1781
00:55:06,560 --> 00:55:08,240
 we now know about women's intuition.

1782
00:55:08,240 --> 00:55:09,840
 (all laughing)

1783
00:55:09,840 --> 00:55:11,920
 - Happy day for the world.

1784
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:15,320
 - I'd love it if his paper, which eventually came out,

1785
00:55:15,320 --> 00:55:17,440
 was about women's intuition, not about the fish.

1786
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:19,480
 (all laughing)

1787
00:55:19,480 --> 00:55:22,060
 (upbeat music)

1788
00:55:22,060 --> 00:55:25,440
 - Okay, that's it.

1789
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:26,440
 That is all of our facts.

1790
00:55:26,440 --> 00:55:27,960

 Sorry.

1802
00:55:47,840 --> 00:55:50,720
 - And Anna, how can they get through to us as a group?

 Or you can head to our website,

1807
00:55:59,480 --> 00:56:01,160
 no such thing as a fish.com.

1808
00:56:01,160 --> 00:56:02,840
 All of the previous episodes are up there,

1809

 'cause we'll be here with another episode

1812
00:56:07,520 --> 00:56:08,640
 and we'll see you then.

1813
00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:09,680
 Goodbye.

1814
