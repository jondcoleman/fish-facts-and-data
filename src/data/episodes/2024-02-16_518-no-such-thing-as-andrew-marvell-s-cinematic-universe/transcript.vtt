00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580
 (upbeat music)

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:16.440
 - Hello and welcome to another episode

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.240
 of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:22.160
 coming to you from the QI offices in Hoburn.

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:23.360
 My name is Dan Shriver.

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:25.520
 I am sitting here with Andrew Hunter Murray,

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:27.680
 James Harkin and Anna Tyshinski.

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:29.780
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:32.480
 of our four favorite facts from the last seven days.

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:35.520
 And in a particular order, here we go.

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.780
 Starting with fact number one, and that is Anna.

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:42.040
 - My fact this week is that shortly after writing an essay

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:45.120
 on why writers shouldn't publish anonymously,

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.880
 Anthony Trollett published a book anonymously.

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:52.260
 - Oh, it's called out a mere 130 years from later.

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:53.560
 (laughing)

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:56.120
 - Not a moment too soon.

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:58.120
 I've just sort of inherited from a friend

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:00.040
 who decided he was never gonna read them,

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:01.920
 the complete works of Anthony Trollett.

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.080
 And he's giving them to me in bits

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:04.920
 and he seems to have given me

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.680
 the three least known Anthony Trollett.

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:11.440
 So this is an introduction to Nina Bellatka, which was...

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:13.160
 - If you wanna get into Trollett,

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:15.520
 I would say probably don't start with that one.

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:18.360
 - It's not an entry level, no, no.

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.440
 Anyway, this fact, Nina Bellatka in the introduction,

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:24.880
 it just mentioned that he wrote an essay in 1865

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:28.360
 and he said a man should always dare to be responsible

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:29.480
 for the work which he does

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:32.240
 and should be ready to accept the shame, rebuffs, ridicule,

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:34.440
 or the indifference which will attend bad work.

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:36.580
 And it's all about how, you know,

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:37.960
 put your name to something

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:41.000
 and then he didn't put his name to Nina Bellatka and...

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.720
 - I do have some sympathy, but if your name is A Trollop

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:45.760
 that you don't wanna put it on every big video.

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:47.480
 (laughing)

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:48.440
 - Who here has read Trollop?

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:50.720
 - I've read the start of Barchester Towers.

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:51.560
 - Okay.

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:52.760
 - Did you read it in preparation for this book?

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:55.080
 - I certainly did. (laughing)

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:56.760
 - Read the first 50 pages.

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:57.600
 - Nice.

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.160
 - Like I've done quite a lot of books over the years

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:00.520
 just because of this podcast.

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:01.360
 - Yeah.

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:03.240
 - Just kind of started reading, got an idea and gone,

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.360
 well, I think I've got an idea

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:06.040
 of this guy's entire earth right now.

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:07.440
 - How have you got to the end?

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:08.920
 You don't know about the robots in it.

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:10.240
 - What?

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:12.360
 So Anna's read some Trollop, Andy, you must have done.

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.760
 - I'm actually a Trollop virgin.

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.680
 - Honestly, I said to my wife last night

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.240
 that if anyone likes Anthony Trollop,

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:20.560
 Andy would like Anthony Trollop.

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:24.280
 - Is it because he writes about ecclesiastical

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:26.120
 matters in the 19th century?

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.960
 - Yeah.

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:27.800
 - Yeah.

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:28.640
 - I think I will.

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:29.480
 - It's right up your street.

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:30.320
 - I don't know if it is.

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:31.160
 I think that's a missed call on Andy.

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:32.000
 - You think?

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.840
 - Yeah, I do.

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.040
 I think I slightly prefer that kind of literature.

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.080
 - It feels like it's in between what you would like.

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:40.120
 It feels to me like it's halfway between Dickens

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:41.560
 and Jane Austen.

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:43.240
 - It is, but the thing about Anthony Trollop,

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:46.520
 he's not as widely read as I think he should be.

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:48.120
 He's frowned on in a lot of circles

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:49.760
 because he was just a machine.

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:50.600
 - Yeah.

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:52.000
 - Of output, wasn't he?

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.320
 47 novels, loads of stories.

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:56.680
 His routine was getting up every morning,

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:59.400
 5.30, writing for three solid hours.

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.120
 He put a watch in front of him,

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:04.480
 made himself write 250 words every 15 minutes,

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:05.960
 and he didn't have word counts that time.

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:08.160
 So he must have incorporated counting the words.

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:09.600
 - He must have counted the pages

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:11.440
 'cause he just had so much stuff.

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:12.280
 - I love it.

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:13.880
 I think that's exactly how I would write

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:15.240
 if I was writing novels.

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:17.120
 - I actually thought reading about him,

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:18.600
 and this is not a negative thing at all.

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:21.040
 I thought there's quite a lot of you in him.

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:22.880
 - He's quite annoying.

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:24.280
 We all write books.

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:27.400
 As someone who, you know, footles around a bit,

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:29.440
 toys with the margins.

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:30.920
 As you know, and you just see,

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:33.400
 in the time you've spent footling around with the margins,

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:37.240
 Anthony Trollop will have written 16 pages in prose.

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:38.320
 He had a portable desk made.

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:39.160
 I love this.

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:40.440
 So he could write on trains.

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:42.400
 And if he was going on board a ship,

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:44.720
 he would meet up with the ship's carpenter

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:46.560
 to arrange proper writing conditions.

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:49.000
 - That's pretty ritzy.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:49.840
 - Wow.

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:50.680
 - That's cool.

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:52.120
 - But the reason he had to do it was 'cause he was,

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:54.040
 and I'm simplifying here, postman.

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:55.480
 (all laughing)

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:57.160
 You are simplifying.

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:58.000
 But he wrote in the morning

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.400
 'cause he had a full-time job at the post office

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:00.840
 for about, what, how long was this?

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:01.680
 Decades.

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:02.520
 - Yeah.

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:03.360
 - And he was quite 60s.

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:04.200
 - He was really senior.

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:05.040
 He was really senior in the post office.

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:06.280
 - Yeah, what if you worked there that long?

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:07.440
 - And it's that really cool fact,

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:09.120
 which is the only thing I knew about him,

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:11.120
 which is that he's basically responsible

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:14.200
 for the reason that we have post boxes all over the UK.

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:15.680
 Possibly he's spotted in in France.

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:17.720
 I don't think he ever claimed that he invented it,

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:19.760
 but he certainly recommended it to the government.

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:21.920
 And they used to be green, but now they're red.

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:22.800
 - That's the thing though.

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:25.120
 Like he is responsible for that, I suppose,

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:26.560
 but they did exist in France.

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:28.040
 They did exist in Belgium.

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:31.200
 The stamp had been invented about 30 or 40 years earlier.

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:33.640
 It feels like we might have got there anyway,

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:34.480
 even without him.

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:37.320
 - Maybe totally, but he's the one who did, yeah.

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:40.320
 Hey, here's a cool quote just to sort of really hammer home

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:41.880
 what a workaholic he was.

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:44.760
 He said, "There is no human bliss equal to 12 hours of work

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:47.600
 "with only six hours in which to do it."

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:50.600
 - He was a bit like bankers in 1990s in the UK

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:53.600
 because his motto was, "No day without a line."

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:54.440
 - Hey.

00:04:54.440 --> 00:05:00.400
 Can we talk a little about Fanny Trollop?

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:01.240
 - Sure. - Yeah.

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:02.440
 - His mum. - Yeah.

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:03.280
 - Yes, please.

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:05.080
 - So his parents were very interesting people.

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:09.080
 Just briefly, his dad was a complete failure in life.

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:10.520
 Sounds harsh, but it is true.

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:11.960
 - It must have been someone in a podcast

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:13.520
 in 200 years saying that about you.

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:14.560
 - I know, I know, and they will.

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:17.080
 I hope they will, I dream of them doing that, you know.

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:19.320
 But his father had law work which had failed

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:20.520
 and a farm which had failed.

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:22.680
 And he decided finally to write, I think,

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:24.800
 called the Encyclopedia Ecclesiastica,

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:27.120
 which would define all the ecclesiastical terms

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:28.600
 that had ever existed.

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:29.880
 And by the time he died,

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:31.640
 he was still only on the letter D.

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:35.360
 - Ah, to be honest, church is quite a long one.

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:38.240
 - Oh, huge, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:39.560
 - Yeah, it was R-Men.

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:41.080
 There's another biggy guy on the top.

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:42.240
 Chassable.

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:43.680
 - I mean, you can see why he-- - Chassel.

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:44.800
 - You can see why he struggled, you know.

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:46.000
 - Christian, Catholic.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.080
 - Oh, baby Jesus, starting with David.

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:49.440
 (both laughing)

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:50.280
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:54.320
 - Anyway, that was his dad, tricky time.

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:58.400
 But his mum was a successful author and mega successful.

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:00.560
 And she made her name by writing a book

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:02.560
 called The Domestic Manners of the Americans.

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:04.520
 'Cause she'd gone to America, set up this business venture

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:07.120
 which had completely collapsed and been a disaster.

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:08.840
 And, but then she wrote this book,

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:11.360
 which was basically just incredibly rude

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:13.360
 about everyone in the USA.

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:15.200
 It was very, very, very snobbish.

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:17.440
 And it became a massive success.

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:19.160
 - She said of people living in New York,

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:21.160
 that they were bullying, struggling, crafty,

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:23.280
 enterprising, industrious, swaggering,

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:26.000
 drinking, boasting, and money-getting.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.880
 But then enemy of the podcast, Mark Twain.

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:29.720
 - Thank you.

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:30.840
 (both laughing)

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:33.680
 - He really loved her and he was like basically saying,

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:34.920
 well, you know, she's telling the truth.

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:37.600
 That's what we're like, fair enough, fair play.

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:40.160
 - So he liked her, so I now don't like her.

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:41.000
 Great, okay, thank you.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.640
 I'm sort of keeping my beef going throughout the century.

00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:46.400
 - One thing I noticed from reading the first 50 pages

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:51.400
 by Chester Towers is how hackish he is with names.

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:52.600
 - Oh, really?

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:54.360
 - I don't know if you notice the same with the ones

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:55.320
 that you've read before.

00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:56.640
 - I've only read the way we live now.

00:06:56.640 --> 00:06:58.520
 - Well, like the first two,

00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:00.360
 a couple of the first characters are,

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:02.880
 I think the policemen and they're called

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:05.800
 Landon Mew New and Omicron Pie,

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:07.800
 where he's basically just taken Greek letters

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:09.200
 and turned them into names.

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:10.040
 - Right.

00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:12.840
 - So what he used to do quite a lot is do that thing

00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:14.640
 where, I suppose Dickens did it a bit,

00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:17.780
 where you just take whatever attribute your character has

00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:19.120
 and just call them that.

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:20.680
 - Oh yeah, Dickens is, yeah.

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:21.520
 - Right, yeah.

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:24.160
 - So in his novel, Miss Mackenzie,

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:26.960
 it's about a young woman who's pursued by three men

00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:29.880
 who are called Handcock, Rub and Ball.

00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:30.720
 - What?

00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:32.080
 (both laughing)

00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:33.280
 - And there was another man.

00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:34.120
 - Handcock?

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:34.960
 - Handcock?

00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:36.200
 (both laughing)

00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:39.080
 - And there's another man in it where he's not a suitable

00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:42.680
 suitor for this woman, and he's called Mr. Frigidae.

00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:43.520
 - Wow.

00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:45.320
 - I mean, they're so on the note.

00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:47.320
 - It takes a bit of the suspense out of it, doesn't it?

00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:49.120
 - Yeah, I think so.

00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:51.880
 I wonder if I can give you some names of characters

00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:54.600
 and you can tell me what they did in the novel.

00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:56.560
 - Oh, okay, yeah, great.

00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:58.240
 - So Dick Rabbit.

00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:01.280
 - Ended up in prison.

00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:03.880
 - So, Shaggy Rabbit, obviously, yeah.

00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:05.400
 Had lots of kids, breed it a lot.

00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:06.240
 - Nice.

00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:07.640
 - No, he was the leader of a hunt.

00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:08.480
 - Okay.

00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:09.520
 - Yeah, good.

00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:10.840
 - Samuel Nickham.

00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:11.680
 - Policeman?

00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:12.520
 - Police, yeah, yeah.

00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:13.360
 - Kind of.

00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:15.040
 He wasn't a policeman, but he found evidence against

00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:17.240
 some people who've been poisoning animals.

00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:18.280
 - I was going to say shoplifter,

00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:19.960
 and I've only just realized that nicking him

00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:23.360
 is something that shoplifters do, and policemen do.

00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:24.200
 I nick him.

00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:25.240
 No, I nick him.

00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:26.320
 We're on opposite sides.

00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:27.320
 How confusing.

00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:28.880
 - Gosh, yeah, food for thought.

00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:32.280
 - So, Oliver Crumblewit.

00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:34.040
 - Stand up, stand up comedian.

00:08:34.040 --> 00:08:34.880
 - Yeah.

00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:36.080
 - Someone who thinks they're funny.

00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:38.960
 So, like, this is on a dad joke

00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:41.840
 to call back to the previous episode character.

00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:43.440
 - No, he was a phrenologist.

00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:44.280
 - Crumble.

00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:46.200
 - So, just like, witless person,

00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:48.480
 I guess he was slugging off phrenology.

00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:50.720
 And Joe Thurabug.

00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:51.560
 - Thurabug.

00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:53.720
 (all laughing)

00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:54.560
 - Proctologist.

00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:57.800
 (all laughing)

00:08:57.800 --> 00:08:59.160
 - No, he was a brewer, of course.

00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:00.000
 - Oh, very nice.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:01.640
 - Brewer, I was going to say the bunghole in the sherry.

00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:02.480
 That's right.

00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:04.280
 Did you, sorry, just while we're quickly

00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:06.880
 on Barchester Towers, have you ever got to a bit

00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:09.960
 in the book where he injects himself as a narrator?

00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:11.920
 Because that's something he apparently loves to do.

00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:12.760
 So, he does it twice.

00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:13.600
 - He pops in.

00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:14.420
 - He pops in.

00:09:14.420 --> 00:09:15.240
 So, for example, there's a sentence

00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:16.760
 that comes in that book where it says,

00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:18.440
 "How easily she would have forgiven

00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:20.520
 "and forgotten the Archdeacon's suspicions

00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:23.000
 "had she heard the whole truth from Mr. Arobin,

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.200
 "but then where would have been my novel?"

00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:28.520
 - Oh, I didn't notice that, I love it.

00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:30.680
 - And then right at the end, he says,

00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:32.680
 "The end of a novel, like the end of a children's

00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:34.880
 "dinner party must be filled with sweet meats

00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:37.080
 "and sugar plums, obviously alluding maybe

00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:39.200
 "to a nice happy ending."

00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:43.000
 - Yes, followed by tears, someone being sick,

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:44.480
 people being dragged home, screaming.

00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:45.720
 - Nits being spread.

00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:49.200
 - Yeah, he does do that self-consciously a little bit.

00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:50.120
 Yeah, sometimes we'll be like,

00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:52.600
 "She's my favorite, actually, she's lovely."

00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:53.440
 - I think that's good.

00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:54.400
 I mean, Jane Austen does that all the time,

00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:55.840
 just sort of pops her head around the curtain

00:09:55.840 --> 00:09:57.480
 and says, "Hello," and then pops back.

00:09:57.480 --> 00:09:58.320
 I like it.

00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:00.840
 Have you heard of his novel, The Fixed Period?

00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:01.840
 This is very weird.

00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:05.600
 So this was his, I think, only venture into sci-fi

00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:09.840
 where it's set in 1980 on a fictional island

00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:12.120
 in the southern hemisphere called Britannula.

00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:14.160
 And the main point of the story is that it has

00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:15.520
 compulsory euthanasia for anyone

00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:18.520
 between the age of 67 and 68, that's the idea.

00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:21.680
 It also features a futuristic cricket match.

00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:23.640
 - Bit harsh, you can't get to the best age.

00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:26.160
 - Right, yeah, yeah.

00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:27.880
 - Maybe he was sick of all the innuendo.

00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:30.480
 - Right, there's a steam tricycle

00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:32.400
 which can go at 25 miles an hour.

00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:34.000
 So it's still rooted in the 19th century.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:38.520
 But, get this, Trollope died at the age of 67 and a half.

00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:39.360
 - Did he?

00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:43.640
 - Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.

00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:45.280
 He didn't do much on the sci-fi,

00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:47.080
 but basically, I think his novels were essentially

00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:48.640
 a Marvel marvel.

00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:49.480
 - Marvel?

00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:50.800
 - Marvel, sorry.

00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:51.640
 - Andrew Marvel.

00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:53.280
 - An Andrew Marvel universe.

00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:54.440
 - 17th century Laureate.

00:10:54.440 --> 00:10:55.280
 - Yeah.

00:10:55.280 --> 00:10:56.120
 - Yes.

00:10:56.120 --> 00:10:56.960
 (laughing)

00:10:56.960 --> 00:10:57.800
 - That's so funny.

00:10:57.800 --> 00:10:59.560
 - It's how they, but world enough and time,

00:10:59.560 --> 00:11:00.560
 they would, is that him?

00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:01.400
 - Yeah, very good.

00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:03.760
 - And then they would have written a Marvel comic

00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:04.760
 because he basically did that.

00:11:04.760 --> 00:11:06.280
 He created a universe.

00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:08.240
 - Ah, right, oh, lovely, yeah, yeah.

00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:09.960
 - And I think this kind of explains why he was able

00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:11.160
 to churn things out so much,

00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:12.400
 as well as the fact that when you read them,

00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:13.640
 there are a lot of extra words.

00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:16.440
 But like the passage of chronicles,

00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:18.040
 oh well, you can lose a lot.

00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:20.320
 - Have you ever read, sorry to, this is a digression,

00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:22.320
 but have you ever read the Wumble books?

00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:23.160
 - No.

00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:25.160
 - I was reading the Wumble books to my daughter

00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:27.000
 and all the way through, it's like,

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.440
 and then the Wumble went to the park

00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:30.920
 and picked up some litter.

00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:33.860
 They picked up an umbrella, a bag of crisps,

00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:37.080
 like this, and they just fill up all the sentences

00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:38.640
 with just lists of nonsense.

00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:40.320
 - That's your word count for the day.

00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:41.360
 That's Trollup thinking, right,

00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:44.200
 I put in 16 adjectives to describe this table.

00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:46.240
 That's fine, I can knock off for the next five minutes.

00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:47.820
 - Can't believe you're reading the Wumble books.

00:11:47.820 --> 00:11:49.160
 'Cause I thought it was just a TV show.

00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:50.520
 You're the guy who's like, you know,

00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:51.360
 the books are actually--

00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:52.680
 - The novelizations of the Wumbles

00:11:52.680 --> 00:11:55.040
 are actually really, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:11:55.040 --> 00:11:56.880
 - I think the books came before the TV show.

00:11:56.880 --> 00:11:58.360
 - Oh, sure they did, yeah.

00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:00.200
 - Anyway.

00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:01.680
 - So it's the Trollup Cinematic Universe.

00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:04.600
 - The Cinematic Universe, so it embosses shit.

00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:06.640
 It's really fun, so I've only read one

00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:08.400
 and actually it's The Way We Live Now, which isn't the universe,

00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:10.960
 but my husband happens to have read quite a few more

00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:12.920
 and he says it's fun 'cause characters pop in

00:12:12.920 --> 00:12:13.760
 from other places.

00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:15.680
 - Lovely, I love it, I love it, I love it a lot.

00:12:15.680 --> 00:12:18.280
 - So that Vick who was quite annoying when he was 25

00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:20.600
 is now 40 and he's a bit wiser.

00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:23.120
 - I reckon that he had hyper-fantasia.

00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:23.960
 - Oh yeah.

00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:25.240
 - Which is, so I have a fantasia,

00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:27.360
 which means I can't imagine things,

00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:29.120
 but some people have hyper-fantasia

00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:30.640
 where you really can't imagine anything.

00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:33.360
 It's like just an incredible story going on in your head

00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:35.920
 and sometimes you don't even realize that it's in your head.

00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:39.440
 And he used to say that his main work that he did was

00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:41.240
 when he was daydreaming.

00:12:41.240 --> 00:12:43.360
 So, you know, he would churn out these words,

00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:45.120
 but actually the rest of the day he'd just be thinking,

00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:47.640
 "Oh, I wonder what my characters would be doing now."

00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:49.840
 When he came to write them down, it was pretty easy for him

00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:52.440
 'cause it was just, this is what I remember them doing.

00:12:52.440 --> 00:12:53.880
 - I think he almost says that the plot

00:12:53.880 --> 00:12:55.880
 is kind of not even really important.

00:12:55.880 --> 00:12:59.120
 It's just, it's about the characters exactly, as you say.

00:12:59.120 --> 00:13:01.200
 - I want to know what his legs were like

00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:03.440
 'cause I think he might have had a fantastic pair of legs.

00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:04.400
 - Okay, go on.

00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:08.280
 - Well, he was all over the UK

00:13:08.280 --> 00:13:09.880
 for his work for the post office.

00:13:09.880 --> 00:13:11.000
 It was sent to Ireland, first of all,

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:12.200
 which is where he started writing.

00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:15.040
 And basically he had to work out the routes for postmen

00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:16.680
 and he rode across the countryside.

00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:19.360
 He did about 40 miles a day riding across the countryside.

00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:21.000
 - It feels like the horse would have a good leg.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:21.960
 - No, you're right, sorry.

00:13:21.960 --> 00:13:23.720
 He'd have a great bum.

00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:26.000
 But he was a member of a thing called the Tramp Society,

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:27.760
 which was a ramblers club across Southeast England.

00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:30.560
 They just walked huge distances every time they let up.

00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:32.680
 Yeah, so I think, I think his lower half

00:13:32.680 --> 00:13:34.120
 might have been incredibly fit.

00:13:34.120 --> 00:13:36.200
 - Well, in support, I think of that.

00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:37.240
 Do you know what the hardest day's work

00:13:37.240 --> 00:13:38.360
 he ever did in his life was?

00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:39.520
 And that's a high bar for Truller.

00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:40.880
 - Oh, no.

00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:42.480
 - It was walking.

00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:45.120
 And it was when he was posted to Glasgow

00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:48.960
 and he wanted to review postman's jobs, basically.

00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:50.720
 And postmen in Glasgow were having to go

00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:51.680
 up and down tenement blocks,

00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:53.960
 sometimes to just post a letter to one person.

00:13:53.960 --> 00:13:57.120
 And he walked the full Glasgow postman's route

00:13:57.120 --> 00:13:58.800
 up and downstairs on his beat

00:13:58.800 --> 00:14:00.680
 and came back to the post office and none of them was like,

00:14:00.680 --> 00:14:02.120
 "Hey, those guys have it really rough.

00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:03.280
 We need to sort it out."

00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:04.120
 - Yes.

00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:06.720
 - His second-ever novel sold 140 copies.

00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:07.560
 - Okay.

00:14:07.560 --> 00:14:08.920
 - Yeah, it did not sell.

00:14:08.920 --> 00:14:10.400
 - What's that one?

00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:12.200
 - They were both set in Ireland, his first two.

00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:14.360
 I think he saw a picture of them and published them out.

00:14:14.360 --> 00:14:15.280
 Oh, I don't know.

00:14:15.280 --> 00:14:16.800
 But the publisher had a resort to advert saying,

00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:18.280
 "Do you know who this guy's mum is?

00:14:18.280 --> 00:14:20.200
 This guy's mum is Fanny Truller."

00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:22.920
 - Fanny Truller, which is so embarrassing

00:14:22.920 --> 00:14:25.720
 as a young debut novelist, you know.

00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:27.600
 What a quote for the front of the book.

00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:29.680
 "Do you know who his mum is?"

00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:32.260
 (upbeat music)

00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:37.040
 - Okay, it is time for fact number two.

00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:38.320
 And that is my fact.

00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:40.480
 My fact this week is that in 2008,

00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:43.280
 a TV channel spent the day rescheduling shows

00:14:43.280 --> 00:14:45.200
 so that millions of people in India

00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:47.240
 could continue to watch a live broadcast

00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:49.560
 of a man trying to kill another man

00:14:49.560 --> 00:14:51.760
 using nothing but his mind.

00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:52.600
 - Okay.

00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:53.440
 - And it took longer than expected.

00:14:53.440 --> 00:14:55.040
 Is it like when a football match goes into extra time

00:14:55.040 --> 00:14:56.640
 and you have to cancel the news afterwards?

00:14:56.640 --> 00:14:58.280
 - It's like that tennis.

00:14:58.280 --> 00:15:00.120
 Do you remember, it was at Mahut Isner?

00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:00.960
 - Mahut Isner.

00:15:00.960 --> 00:15:02.600
 - Which went on, it was a Wimbledon several,

00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:04.680
 like 10 years ago now, and it went on,

00:15:04.680 --> 00:15:06.880
 they played like 70 games each.

00:15:06.880 --> 00:15:07.720
 - Yeah, it was something like that.

00:15:07.720 --> 00:15:08.560
 - It was something like crackers.

00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:09.640
 - Yeah, it was kind of that.

00:15:09.640 --> 00:15:11.920
 - And Mahut Isner, I imagine, got closer to death

00:15:11.920 --> 00:15:14.120
 than the person who was trying to be killed here.

00:15:14.120 --> 00:15:15.400
 - Well, not quite, actually.

00:15:15.400 --> 00:15:18.440
 So, okay, at that time, there was a politician

00:15:18.440 --> 00:15:19.840
 who said out loud that she thought

00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:21.440
 that someone was attacking her mentally

00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:23.720
 using Tantric powers, which is, you know,

00:15:23.720 --> 00:15:25.640
 when we talk about Tantric sex and all that,

00:15:25.640 --> 00:15:28.120
 there's a side of it, which is to do with the mind,

00:15:28.120 --> 00:15:30.080
 and you can supposedly attack people

00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:33.200
 if you're using the dark practices of it, right?

00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:35.440
 So, as a result, there was a TV show

00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:38.040
 where skeptics and Tantra practitioners

00:15:38.040 --> 00:15:39.640
 were brought together on the show,

00:15:39.640 --> 00:15:42.000
 it was called Tantric Power versus Science.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.560
 And while on the show, this guy who was called

00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:48.080
 Pandit Srintheshama claimed that he could kill someone

00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:50.640
 within minutes using nothing but his mind.

00:15:50.640 --> 00:15:53.040
 Now, the person who was sitting on the panel with him

00:15:53.040 --> 00:15:55.280
 was a guy called Sinal Edamaruku.

00:15:55.280 --> 00:15:56.560
 - Is he representing Science in this?

00:15:56.560 --> 00:16:00.320
 - He is the president of the Rational International Group.

00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:02.040
 He says, you can't do that.

00:16:02.040 --> 00:16:02.880
 You think you can do that?

00:16:02.880 --> 00:16:04.120
 Do it to me now.

00:16:04.120 --> 00:16:06.560
 And the guy says, okay, fine, I'll do it to you now.

00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:08.440
 - That's annoying when they call your bluff like that,

00:16:08.440 --> 00:16:09.800
 isn't it? - Exactly.

00:16:09.800 --> 00:16:10.960
 So, he says, do it now.

00:16:10.960 --> 00:16:13.000
 So, they say, all right, let's do this.

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.200
 The host of the show is going, all right, let's do this.

00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:17.240
 - Legally, very tricky water for the channel

00:16:17.240 --> 00:16:18.800
 and the program to be in. - Exactly.

00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:21.040
 - 'Cause I'm thinking about all the forms

00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:23.360
 we have to fill in on QI if you just, you know,

00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:24.200
 strike a match.

00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:28.320
 - You very rarely use dark tantra on QI.

00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:33.600
 - So, basically what happens is, is this guy, Sharma gets up

00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:35.560
 and he starts focusing his mind on him.

00:16:35.560 --> 00:16:36.920
 It's clearly not working.

00:16:36.920 --> 00:16:40.000
 The rational guy is sort of giving laps and so on.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:43.480
 So, Sharma comes over, he starts sprinkling water on him

00:16:43.480 --> 00:16:45.040
 as an intimidation tactic.

00:16:45.040 --> 00:16:46.680
 He starts ruffling his hair.

00:16:46.680 --> 00:16:50.200
 - Oh, the big guns are coming out now.

00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:51.840
 - He covers his eyes.

00:16:51.840 --> 00:16:52.680
 - It was all that stuff.

00:16:52.680 --> 00:16:55.520
 But then, and this is where it gets a bit desperate,

00:16:55.520 --> 00:16:59.120
 he suddenly presses his fingers down onto his forehead

00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:01.840
 and steadily really pushes and pushes

00:17:01.840 --> 00:17:05.200
 and he has to be called out because basically,

00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:06.800
 you will kill me 'cause you're trying

00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:08.920
 to crush my skull, basically.

00:17:08.920 --> 00:17:10.800
 So, he has to go back to his seat

00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:12.320
 and he has to do it with his mind.

00:17:12.320 --> 00:17:14.800
 Now, at this point, the show's meant to be ending.

00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:15.880
 But they say it's not done yet.

00:17:15.880 --> 00:17:18.760
 So, the show continues and the next show is canceled.

00:17:18.760 --> 00:17:20.080
 And at this point, word is getting around.

00:17:20.080 --> 00:17:21.800
 So, people are tuning in and tuning in.

00:17:21.800 --> 00:17:23.800
 After a couple of hours, the guy's exhausted,

00:17:23.800 --> 00:17:25.080
 Sharma's exhausted and he says,

00:17:25.080 --> 00:17:26.120
 "But I'm not done yet.

00:17:26.120 --> 00:17:27.800
 "Let's meet again this evening.

00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:31.200
 "And this evening, I will do the ultimate destruction ceremony

00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:32.040
 "and kill you."

00:17:32.040 --> 00:17:33.920
 What is going through his mind when he's saying,

00:17:33.920 --> 00:17:35.240
 "I'm gonna do that?"

00:17:35.240 --> 00:17:37.320
 I'm sure I can think of an ultimate destruction ceremony

00:17:37.320 --> 00:17:39.480
 in the two hours between the broadcast.

00:17:39.480 --> 00:17:40.800
 Like, what is his plan?

00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:44.240
 - But then, I think his plan probably is to not turn up

00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:47.320
 and then go, "Oh, sorry, I was killing some other person."

00:17:47.320 --> 00:17:49.520
 They go to another school, you wouldn't know them.

00:17:49.520 --> 00:17:51.120
 - Yeah, so they do it at night.

00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:53.800
 It's performed under an altar in an open night sky.

00:17:53.800 --> 00:17:55.000
 They've got all the cameras there

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:56.960
 and he tries and tries and tries.

00:17:56.960 --> 00:17:59.160
 And obviously, the guy who's the rational guy

00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:00.840
 is laughing his ass off the whole time.

00:18:00.840 --> 00:18:01.680
 So, it didn't work out.

00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:03.960
 But this, just to remind you, is 2008.

00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:05.280
 And this was broadcast live.

00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:07.720
 And according to many reports,

00:18:07.720 --> 00:18:09.080
 some say hundreds of millions,

00:18:09.080 --> 00:18:10.720
 obviously a huge population in India.

00:18:10.720 --> 00:18:14.480
 But millions tuned in to see a man killed live on TV,

00:18:14.480 --> 00:18:15.920
 probably knowing he wasn't gonna be,

00:18:15.920 --> 00:18:17.360
 but wanted to see what happened.

00:18:17.360 --> 00:18:18.760
 - I have a question for you guys.

00:18:18.760 --> 00:18:20.280
 If you were on that TV show

00:18:20.280 --> 00:18:21.800
 and you were next to a tantric master

00:18:21.800 --> 00:18:24.440
 and they said, "I could kill someone with my mind,"

00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:27.360
 would you have the courage to say,

00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:29.280
 "No, you can't do it to me."

00:18:29.280 --> 00:18:30.440
 You definitely would.

00:18:30.440 --> 00:18:32.440
 There wouldn't be a tiny bit of doubt

00:18:32.440 --> 00:18:34.400
 that like, I'm pretty sure you can't.

00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:36.080
 - Once he started, I'd shit my pants.

00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:38.560
 But yeah, I would probably call it.

00:18:38.560 --> 00:18:39.640
 - I would feel fairly confident

00:18:39.640 --> 00:18:40.480
 that that wouldn't happen.

00:18:40.480 --> 00:18:42.840
 - No, but you can't be fairly confident.

00:18:42.840 --> 00:18:44.880
 - Okay, I would be 100% certain

00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:45.720
 that that wouldn't happen.

00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:46.560
 - You'd be up for it.

00:18:46.560 --> 00:18:49.320
 - I would be pretty confident,

00:18:49.320 --> 00:18:50.320
 but I would think to myself,

00:18:50.320 --> 00:18:52.960
 "I'd be so annoyed if I have a heart attack and die."

00:18:52.960 --> 00:18:53.960
 Unrelatedly.

00:18:53.960 --> 00:18:56.520
 - When I went to, I was in Bhutan

00:18:56.520 --> 00:18:59.440
 and I went to the tiger's nest monastery.

00:18:59.440 --> 00:19:01.680
 And there's a little bit where you have to jump

00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:03.200
 from one bit to the other

00:19:03.200 --> 00:19:07.680
 and you're going over a sheer drop of thousands of feet.

00:19:07.680 --> 00:19:10.920
 And the step is basically just a step.

00:19:10.920 --> 00:19:12.680
 It's a step that you do every single day

00:19:12.680 --> 00:19:14.080
 and it's no problem.

00:19:14.080 --> 00:19:15.840
 But all the way through, I was thinking,

00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:18.920
 "If I fall now, what a fucking idiot.

00:19:18.920 --> 00:19:21.920
 "What an idiot I am to be doing that."

00:19:21.920 --> 00:19:23.960
 And I suppose it's that kind of thought.

00:19:23.960 --> 00:19:25.520
 - And the pressure of the TV cameras

00:19:25.520 --> 00:19:28.320
 will make you think, "This is a very public forum."

00:19:28.320 --> 00:19:30.440
 I can understand, I'm very impressed by the skeptic.

00:19:30.440 --> 00:19:31.920
 - You'd feel embarrassed for him.

00:19:31.920 --> 00:19:33.600
 You'd start wanting to die.

00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:35.040
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:35.880
 - You'd fake it.

00:19:35.880 --> 00:19:37.160
 - Do you think you'd fake it, Dan?

00:19:37.160 --> 00:19:38.240
 - I'd fake it.

00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:40.080
 - Well, it would be really fun

00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:42.520
 to draw the death Tantra dude out

00:19:42.520 --> 00:19:45.560
 by pretending to die and then like, "Aaah."

00:19:45.560 --> 00:19:46.400
 And that would be great.

00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:47.240
 - That's a good point.

00:19:47.240 --> 00:19:48.760
 - I've never heard of this.

00:19:48.760 --> 00:19:52.600
 I think of Tantra as primarily a sexual thing.

00:19:52.600 --> 00:19:55.680
 Now, I'm thinking about Sting.

00:19:55.680 --> 00:19:56.520
 - Yes.

00:19:56.520 --> 00:19:59.840
 - Who proclaimed, I think, in the 90s

00:19:59.840 --> 00:20:02.800
 that he could have sex for five hours because of Tantra.

00:20:02.800 --> 00:20:04.120
 Just Tantric skills.

00:20:04.120 --> 00:20:05.240
 - He says he never said that.

00:20:05.240 --> 00:20:07.360
 - I don't know if he does now, but that's--

00:20:07.360 --> 00:20:08.200
 - Right.

00:20:08.200 --> 00:20:10.000
 - He says, "Bob Geldoff spread that rumor."

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:10.840
 - Right.

00:20:10.840 --> 00:20:11.680
 - Yeah.

00:20:11.680 --> 00:20:12.520
 - And then he said, "Oh, I said five hours,

00:20:12.520 --> 00:20:14.040
 but that includes dinner and a movie

00:20:14.040 --> 00:20:15.040
 followed by some begging."

00:20:15.040 --> 00:20:16.680
 You know, he's got some very funny jokes about it.

00:20:16.680 --> 00:20:17.800
 Yeah, yeah.

00:20:17.800 --> 00:20:18.640
 But that was--

00:20:18.640 --> 00:20:19.480
 - No movie is.

00:20:19.480 --> 00:20:20.320
 - Lord of the Rings.

00:20:20.320 --> 00:20:22.200
 - The entire trilogy.

00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:24.320
 - No, but I don't know anything about Tantra, really.

00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:25.160
 Although the idea of Tantra,

00:20:25.160 --> 00:20:26.440
 and I gather it's more of a philosophy

00:20:26.440 --> 00:20:27.680
 or a set of philosophies.

00:20:27.680 --> 00:20:29.480
 And it's from lots of different--

00:20:29.480 --> 00:20:30.320
 - Very complicated.

00:20:30.320 --> 00:20:32.760
 - Lots of different religions have elements of Tantra.

00:20:32.760 --> 00:20:33.600
 - Definitely, yeah.

00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:35.320
 - That sort of spread across all these different schools

00:20:35.320 --> 00:20:36.160
 of thought.

00:20:36.160 --> 00:20:37.000
 - There's no one thing.

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:40.400
 And when I say the dark side or whatever,

00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:42.920
 that's so rare, it's not really even a thing.

00:20:42.920 --> 00:20:44.040
 We'll get letters, people saying,

00:20:44.040 --> 00:20:44.880
 "That's not a thing."

00:20:44.880 --> 00:20:45.720
 - Right, right, right, yeah.

00:20:45.720 --> 00:20:46.760
 - Well, there's space in Hinduism.

00:20:46.760 --> 00:20:47.600
 - Yeah.

00:20:47.600 --> 00:20:48.680
 - When we say lots of different religions.

00:20:48.680 --> 00:20:51.320
 And it's not its own belief system within Hinduism

00:20:51.320 --> 00:20:52.160
 as far as I can tell.

00:20:52.160 --> 00:20:54.360
 It's like a series of practices

00:20:54.360 --> 00:20:57.040
 which seem to exist in lots of strands of Hinduism.

00:20:57.040 --> 00:20:59.360
 - Yeah, it's almost like non-Orphodox Hinduism.

00:20:59.360 --> 00:21:00.200
 - Yeah.

00:21:00.200 --> 00:21:02.440
 In fact, I did read things saying the whole point of it

00:21:02.440 --> 00:21:05.600
 was to subvert Hinduism and encourage lots of things

00:21:05.600 --> 00:21:07.040
 that Hinduism does not.

00:21:07.040 --> 00:21:09.520
 Like, I think there's one where you're encouraged

00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:12.000
 to have the special Tantric fivesm,

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:14.280
 which is like eating meat, drinking wine.

00:21:14.280 --> 00:21:15.120
 - Right.

00:21:15.120 --> 00:21:16.920
 (all laughing)

00:21:16.920 --> 00:21:17.840
 - Have you ever had a fivesm?

00:21:17.840 --> 00:21:21.160
 Yeah, I've had a bit of meat and a drink, a bit of wine, yeah?

00:21:21.160 --> 00:21:22.800
 - Coming to the party to make it.

00:21:22.800 --> 00:21:23.640
 - I didn't have--

00:21:23.640 --> 00:21:24.480
 - Wine's everyone in there.

00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:25.480
 - Yes.

00:21:25.480 --> 00:21:27.600
 - God, that looks delicious.

00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:28.760
 I've had a foursome.

00:21:28.760 --> 00:21:30.240
 I didn't have the sherry at the end,

00:21:30.240 --> 00:21:31.480
 which would have been, you know.

00:21:31.480 --> 00:21:33.280
 - To be fair, sex is the last one.

00:21:33.280 --> 00:21:35.120
 - Oh, okay, okay.

00:21:35.120 --> 00:21:35.960
 So it's like a date.

00:21:35.960 --> 00:21:36.800
 We're not describing a date.

00:21:36.800 --> 00:21:38.120
 - Are we describing a date?

00:21:38.120 --> 00:21:39.120
 - What are the previous four?

00:21:39.120 --> 00:21:39.960
 Is there an order?

00:21:39.960 --> 00:21:40.960
 - Netflix.

00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:41.800
 - Sorry.

00:21:41.800 --> 00:21:47.280
 - It's drinking, eating, movie, begging.

00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:48.160
 (all laughing)

00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:49.280
 Sex.

00:21:49.280 --> 00:21:53.760
 - So the five are alcohol, meat, fish, grain, and sex.

00:21:53.760 --> 00:21:54.600
 - Okay.

00:21:54.600 --> 00:21:55.680
 - You're very full at that point,

00:21:55.680 --> 00:21:56.760
 so it's not very pleasant.

00:21:56.760 --> 00:21:57.920
 - We do that five at home,

00:21:57.920 --> 00:21:59.760
 but the fifth one is always headache.

00:21:59.760 --> 00:22:01.760
 (all laughing)

00:22:01.760 --> 00:22:03.000
 - I'm really annoyed.

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:06.840
 - But the idea is violating all these Hindu taboos.

00:22:06.840 --> 00:22:07.680
 - I see.

00:22:07.680 --> 00:22:10.200
 - And I think that's called left-handed tantra.

00:22:10.200 --> 00:22:12.200
 So there's left-handed tantra and right-handed tantra,

00:22:12.200 --> 00:22:14.160
 and left-handed tantra is the sex one.

00:22:14.160 --> 00:22:15.400
 - I'm left-handed.

00:22:15.400 --> 00:22:16.480
 - Well, that doesn't surprise me.

00:22:16.480 --> 00:22:17.840
 - No, no, no, no.

00:22:17.840 --> 00:22:19.880
 It's all starting to come together.

00:22:19.880 --> 00:22:21.520
 - I always do left-handed tantra,

00:22:21.520 --> 00:22:23.440
 'cause it feels like someone else is doing that.

00:22:23.440 --> 00:22:26.040
 (all laughing)

00:22:26.040 --> 00:22:29.440
 - There's no thousand-year-old tradition

00:22:29.440 --> 00:22:30.720
 we can be trusted with.

00:22:30.720 --> 00:22:32.200
 (all laughing)

00:22:32.200 --> 00:22:35.120
 - Other things that are done in tantra traditions

00:22:35.120 --> 00:22:38.240
 that are non-sexual for the right-handed,

00:22:38.240 --> 00:22:40.960
 living in cemeteries, if you want that,

00:22:40.960 --> 00:22:42.960
 and smearing cremation ashes on your body.

00:22:42.960 --> 00:22:45.640
 So these are all agori rituals.

00:22:45.640 --> 00:22:47.120
 - And do you say agori?

00:22:47.120 --> 00:22:47.960
 - Yeah.

00:22:47.960 --> 00:22:48.880
 - 'Cause it sounds quite gory.

00:22:48.880 --> 00:22:51.960
 - Oh yeah, agori tradition, yes.

00:22:51.960 --> 00:22:53.000
 - I was just missering.

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:53.840
 - No, that's very good.

00:22:53.840 --> 00:22:57.480
 Maybe it's a fun play on words, 'cause it is very dark.

00:22:57.480 --> 00:22:59.120
 They smoke a lot of marijuana,

00:22:59.120 --> 00:23:00.920
 not too dark, they drink a lot of alcohol,

00:23:00.920 --> 00:23:02.560
 and they meditate on top of corpses.

00:23:02.560 --> 00:23:03.960
 - I got some good news for you, Dan.

00:23:03.960 --> 00:23:05.040
 - Yeah.

00:23:05.040 --> 00:23:07.880
 - So they're meditating on a corpse.

00:23:07.880 --> 00:23:09.440
 There are quite a lot of rules

00:23:09.440 --> 00:23:12.240
 about the kind of corpse that you can meditate on.

00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:14.920
 Ideally, it would be someone who died from drowning,

00:23:14.920 --> 00:23:17.480
 lightning strikes, snake bites, something like that.

00:23:17.480 --> 00:23:19.920
 You are allowed to kill the person

00:23:19.920 --> 00:23:22.440
 before you meditate on top of them,

00:23:22.440 --> 00:23:26.240
 but you shouldn't really meditate on top of a man

00:23:26.240 --> 00:23:29.800
 with a beard or on top of a wife guy.

00:23:29.800 --> 00:23:34.560
 - Anyone who's hand-packed, you shouldn't be doing.

00:23:34.560 --> 00:23:35.720
 - Really?

00:23:35.720 --> 00:23:37.880
 - Wow, Dan, you're in the clear.

00:23:37.880 --> 00:23:40.160
 - I am safe and sound, guys.

00:23:40.160 --> 00:23:43.640
 - Wow.

00:23:43.640 --> 00:23:46.880
 - But what about a clean-shaven bad boy like me, James?

00:23:46.880 --> 00:23:49.360
 Am I in the firing line for getting meditated on?

00:23:49.360 --> 00:23:50.200
 - Oh dear.

00:23:50.200 --> 00:23:52.280
 - That's amazing.

00:23:52.280 --> 00:23:55.160
 - I read an amazing way of if someone,

00:23:55.160 --> 00:23:57.160
 if so, let's say we are on that show

00:23:57.160 --> 00:24:00.520
 and we have said yes, consenting to Sharma

00:24:00.520 --> 00:24:02.320
 trying to kill us with his mind.

00:24:02.320 --> 00:24:05.200
 One way of getting him out of your mind

00:24:05.200 --> 00:24:08.120
 and shaking off the bad juju that's inside there

00:24:08.120 --> 00:24:09.600
 is something that was practiced

00:24:09.600 --> 00:24:13.440
 by a guy called Viktor Kortchnoy, who's a chess player.

00:24:13.440 --> 00:24:14.280
 - Yeah.

00:24:14.280 --> 00:24:16.520
 - Now, we spoke many episodes ago

00:24:16.520 --> 00:24:20.000
 about a very famous chess championship in 1978,

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:22.960
 and there were two Russian grandmaster chess players,

00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:25.280
 Karpov against Kortchnoy.

00:24:25.280 --> 00:24:28.200
 And basically, Kortchnoy, as he was sitting there,

00:24:28.200 --> 00:24:32.000
 had a guy in the audience who was mentally trying

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:33.600
 to ruin his game, get into his head.

00:24:33.600 --> 00:24:37.240
 It was the weirdest chess game ever, right?

00:24:37.240 --> 00:24:39.680
 Kortchnoy eventually brings in two people

00:24:39.680 --> 00:24:43.080
 who practice the idea of all this mind power stuff.

00:24:43.080 --> 00:24:45.440
 And he genuinely did this during the course of the game

00:24:45.440 --> 00:24:48.000
 to get rid of all the bad thoughts that were in his head.

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:51.120
 You do a handstand so that you can shake it out

00:24:51.120 --> 00:24:53.520
 using the gravity that's pulling down to the earth,

00:24:53.520 --> 00:24:54.560
 all the bad vibes.

00:24:54.560 --> 00:24:56.680
 So, if ever you're in a space

00:24:56.680 --> 00:24:59.760
 where you think you're being infiltrated in your mind,

00:24:59.760 --> 00:25:00.800
 do a handstand.

00:25:00.800 --> 00:25:02.280
 - If you believe, though.

00:25:02.280 --> 00:25:03.120
 - Yeah.

00:25:03.120 --> 00:25:04.880
 - I mean, we're sort of skirting around the psychosomatic thing.

00:25:04.880 --> 00:25:06.120
 If you believe that someone is in the crowd

00:25:06.120 --> 00:25:06.960
 getting into your head.

00:25:06.960 --> 00:25:07.800
 - Which he did.

00:25:07.800 --> 00:25:08.640
 - Then they're already in there.

00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:09.480
 - Yeah.

00:25:09.480 --> 00:25:10.320
 - And he was in there.

00:25:10.320 --> 00:25:11.480
 Like, that's exactly it.

00:25:11.480 --> 00:25:12.560
 He believed that was in there.

00:25:12.560 --> 00:25:13.440
 - Did he win?

00:25:13.440 --> 00:25:14.280
 - He lost.

00:25:14.280 --> 00:25:15.600
 Only just by one game.

00:25:15.600 --> 00:25:17.320
 He was down, and then he did the handstand thing,

00:25:17.320 --> 00:25:19.240
 and he came back for like a few games.

00:25:19.240 --> 00:25:20.680
 And then he lost the final game.

00:25:20.680 --> 00:25:23.200
 - Didn't shake that last bit out, did he?

00:25:23.200 --> 00:25:28.240
 - This just reminded me of another interesting Hindu sect,

00:25:28.240 --> 00:25:30.960
 which I've been fond of for a while, the Nagasadhus.

00:25:30.960 --> 00:25:31.800
 - Okay.

00:25:31.800 --> 00:25:34.160
 - Which, we've talked about the Naked Sadhus,

00:25:34.160 --> 00:25:35.520
 which who are just naked all the time?

00:25:35.520 --> 00:25:36.880
 - Sadhus.

00:25:36.880 --> 00:25:38.920
 - Naked Sadhus, yeah.

00:25:38.920 --> 00:25:40.320
 So, a lot of this is about asceticism

00:25:40.320 --> 00:25:41.920
 and renouncing everything.

00:25:41.920 --> 00:25:44.800
 And they have very strict exercise routines.

00:25:44.800 --> 00:25:46.920
 So, they're very fit, but they have long beards,

00:25:46.920 --> 00:25:48.600
 but they have no clothes.

00:25:48.600 --> 00:25:51.440
 They also smear themselves in ashes.

00:25:51.440 --> 00:25:53.800
 I think this seems to be a thing.

00:25:53.800 --> 00:25:56.440
 But they were great fighters back in the day.

00:25:56.440 --> 00:25:57.880
 So, they've been around for many hundreds,

00:25:57.880 --> 00:25:59.080
 for thousands of years.

00:25:59.080 --> 00:26:00.400
 And they were military men.

00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:02.080
 So, in 19th century reports,

00:26:02.080 --> 00:26:03.520
 they wore nothing but a belt,

00:26:03.520 --> 00:26:06.400
 and they'd have ammunition and flints and guns

00:26:06.400 --> 00:26:07.440
 hanging off their belt.

00:26:07.440 --> 00:26:08.280
 - Wow, like Batman.

00:26:08.280 --> 00:26:10.280
 - Yeah, but nude Batman.

00:26:10.280 --> 00:26:12.040
 - Yes, 'cause he normally is wearing

00:26:12.040 --> 00:26:13.760
 the full Batman outfit.

00:26:13.760 --> 00:26:15.440
 - He's in fact a bit too covered up, really.

00:26:15.440 --> 00:26:17.840
 - Yeah, yeah, but I'm just mean like the utility belt.

00:26:17.840 --> 00:26:19.560
 - Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, absolutely.

00:26:19.560 --> 00:26:20.960
 - They've got the utility belt.

00:26:20.960 --> 00:26:22.720
 And that's all you need, really.

00:26:22.720 --> 00:26:25.120
 And they were great military leaders.

00:26:25.120 --> 00:26:26.800
 And in fact, there was one in the 18th century

00:26:26.800 --> 00:26:28.400
 who commanded over 20,000 men.

00:26:28.400 --> 00:26:30.440
 In fact, quite a few of them commanded that many.

00:26:30.440 --> 00:26:34.160
 And in the battles that the British East India Company had

00:26:34.160 --> 00:26:35.680
 when they were trying to colonize India,

00:26:35.680 --> 00:26:37.120
 they played a huge role.

00:26:37.120 --> 00:26:39.560
 And bizarrely, they were often mercenaries.

00:26:39.560 --> 00:26:41.560
 So, they often fought for different sides,

00:26:41.560 --> 00:26:44.400
 which is weird given that they renounce all possessions.

00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:46.120
 So, I don't know what you're using,

00:26:46.120 --> 00:26:47.320
 all that money you're getting paid.

00:26:47.320 --> 00:26:48.880
 - Oh, you gotta, you know, there are,

00:26:48.880 --> 00:26:51.560
 there are incidental expenditures and you, you know,

00:26:51.560 --> 00:26:52.880
 you want to have something for a rainy day.

00:26:52.880 --> 00:26:54.280
 - You want a really nice belt.

00:26:54.280 --> 00:26:57.000
 (all laughing)

00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:59.600
 - That beard oil's very pricey, um.

00:26:59.600 --> 00:27:02.200
 (all laughing)

00:27:02.200 --> 00:27:04.780
 (upbeat music)

00:27:04.780 --> 00:27:10.560
 - Okay, it is time for fact number three.

00:27:10.560 --> 00:27:12.320
 And that is James.

00:27:12.320 --> 00:27:14.680
 - Okay, my fact this week is that the last thing

00:27:14.680 --> 00:27:18.080
 that British soldiers going to the Crimean War saw

00:27:18.080 --> 00:27:20.640
 was Queen Victoria throwing a shoe at them.

00:27:20.640 --> 00:27:22.440
 (all laughing)

00:27:22.440 --> 00:27:23.600
 - And stay out.

00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:25.480
 (all laughing)

00:27:25.480 --> 00:27:27.080
 - No, this is a good luck thing.

00:27:27.080 --> 00:27:30.040
 It's been a good luck thing since the 16th century at least.

00:27:30.040 --> 00:27:32.680
 And Queen Victoria, when she got married,

00:27:32.680 --> 00:27:34.400
 she had shoes thrown after her.

00:27:34.400 --> 00:27:37.200
 So, she obviously had this idea that it was good luck.

00:27:37.200 --> 00:27:40.720
 And there is an 1854 sketch from Punch Magazine

00:27:40.720 --> 00:27:43.440
 that shows her throwing a shoe at her soldiers

00:27:43.440 --> 00:27:45.200
 as they go off for the Crimean War.

00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:47.680
 - It's very, I'd never heard this tradition at all.

00:27:47.680 --> 00:27:49.120
 Shoe-trucking for luck.

00:27:49.120 --> 00:27:50.240
 I've just never, ever heard it.

00:27:50.240 --> 00:27:51.080
 But she did it a lot.

00:27:51.080 --> 00:27:52.520
 She did it in 1855.

00:27:52.520 --> 00:27:55.400
 She chucked shoes into Balmoral Castle again for luck.

00:27:55.400 --> 00:27:56.320
 And that was a.

00:27:56.320 --> 00:27:58.160
 - And is it she takes one of her own shoes off

00:27:58.160 --> 00:27:59.800
 or does she take an extra shoe in her handbag?

00:27:59.800 --> 00:28:00.640
 - Great question.

00:28:00.640 --> 00:28:01.480
 - Good question.

00:28:01.480 --> 00:28:02.320
 - Don't know.

00:28:02.320 --> 00:28:03.680
 - Yeah, so the first one she's throwing it off

00:28:03.680 --> 00:28:06.200
 from where she's, she's standing on a balcony.

00:28:06.200 --> 00:28:07.040
 - That's right.

00:28:07.040 --> 00:28:07.880
 - So, okay, so she's at home.

00:28:07.880 --> 00:28:09.080
 She's probably in slippers anyway.

00:28:09.080 --> 00:28:11.080
 So, she could do that with a shoe.

00:28:11.080 --> 00:28:12.240
 - And you don't want to chuck a really heavy shoe

00:28:12.240 --> 00:28:13.080
 in case I hit someone.

00:28:13.080 --> 00:28:13.920
 - Yeah.

00:28:13.920 --> 00:28:14.760
 - Well, it's from a balcony.

00:28:14.760 --> 00:28:15.600
 It seems quite risky.

00:28:15.600 --> 00:28:16.440
 - That's gonna be my question.

00:28:16.440 --> 00:28:17.760
 Do we know where the shoe is?

00:28:17.760 --> 00:28:19.280
 'Cause I couldn't, I couldn't find it.

00:28:19.280 --> 00:28:20.120
 - The shoe?

00:28:20.120 --> 00:28:20.960
 - Yeah, the shoe.

00:28:20.960 --> 00:28:22.880
 - I don't know how many of you have been victorious.

00:28:22.880 --> 00:28:24.240
 - Yeah, shoes are forever.

00:28:24.240 --> 00:28:27.000
 - Yeah, but the shoe, lots of shoe traditions.

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:28.440
 Hiding shoes in the walls of your building.

00:28:28.440 --> 00:28:29.520
 That was not the big one, wasn't it?

00:28:29.520 --> 00:28:30.860
 - Yeah.

00:28:30.860 --> 00:28:32.200
 - Is that for good luck?

00:28:32.200 --> 00:28:33.760
 Or just for a rainy day?

00:28:33.760 --> 00:28:35.040
 - To ward off evil.

00:28:35.040 --> 00:28:36.840
 - Ah, evil hates shoes.

00:28:36.840 --> 00:28:39.800
 - Yes, the Northampton made all,

00:28:39.800 --> 00:28:41.080
 basically all the shoes made in the UK

00:28:41.080 --> 00:28:41.920
 came from Northampton.

00:28:41.920 --> 00:28:42.760
 - Really?

00:28:42.760 --> 00:28:43.840
 - Yeah, 'cause it was Chewtown.

00:28:43.840 --> 00:28:45.480
 - That's why the football team's called the Cobblers.

00:28:45.480 --> 00:28:46.320
 - Oh, is it?

00:28:46.320 --> 00:28:47.520
 I didn't know they were.

00:28:47.520 --> 00:28:49.640
 But they've got a thing called the Hidden Shoe Index

00:28:49.640 --> 00:28:51.240
 at the Northampton Museum.

00:28:51.240 --> 00:28:53.720
 - I read it was called the Concealed Shoe Index,

00:28:53.720 --> 00:28:56.480
 which made me wonder what CSI Northampton would be like.

00:28:56.480 --> 00:28:58.000
 (laughing)

00:28:58.000 --> 00:28:58.840
 - Very strong.

00:28:58.840 --> 00:29:00.960
 I don't know which is the true name.

00:29:00.960 --> 00:29:02.640
 It goes back to the '50s though,

00:29:02.640 --> 00:29:04.840
 but the oldest shoe they've got or found in a building

00:29:04.840 --> 00:29:06.400
 dates back to 1308.

00:29:06.400 --> 00:29:07.240
 - Wow.

00:29:07.240 --> 00:29:08.160
 - That was concealed in a building, yeah.

00:29:08.160 --> 00:29:09.640
 - That's not gonna be wearable, is it?

00:29:09.640 --> 00:29:10.480
 - No.

00:29:10.480 --> 00:29:11.300
 - Is this related to,

00:29:11.300 --> 00:29:13.880
 I mentioned cats being found in buildings.

00:29:13.880 --> 00:29:14.720
 That's the thing, isn't it?

00:29:14.720 --> 00:29:16.240
 That people would bury their dead cats.

00:29:16.240 --> 00:29:19.240
 - Yeah, war-lover's cat, frogs as well.

00:29:19.240 --> 00:29:20.360
 - Frogs, yes.

00:29:20.360 --> 00:29:21.400
 Presumably that was for good luck.

00:29:21.400 --> 00:29:26.160
 - I think it's to also attract or distract or deter witches.

00:29:26.160 --> 00:29:27.520
 We're back to the evil thing.

00:29:27.520 --> 00:29:28.360
 - Distract.

00:29:28.360 --> 00:29:29.200
 Is that what I kept?

00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:30.040
 (laughing)

00:29:30.040 --> 00:29:31.160
 That's what I was doing.

00:29:31.160 --> 00:29:33.520
 Maybe one of the most famous shoe-throwing incidents

00:29:33.520 --> 00:29:37.320
 is when George Bush had two shoes thrown at him, in fact.

00:29:37.320 --> 00:29:40.660
 It's in 2008 by an Iraqi reporter.

00:29:40.660 --> 00:29:44.040
 And actually, I was rereading what George Bush said

00:29:44.040 --> 00:29:45.680
 when he was asked about it afterwards.

00:29:45.680 --> 00:29:47.200
 And I thought, you know,

00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:48.560
 there was a lot of criticism of George Bush

00:29:48.560 --> 00:29:49.560
 at the time, understandably.

00:29:49.560 --> 00:29:52.400
 But he said, "I know I wasn't offended.

00:29:52.400 --> 00:29:54.360
 "We're in a democracy.

00:29:54.360 --> 00:29:55.400
 "This is freedom for you.

00:29:55.400 --> 00:29:58.040
 "You're allowed to do this kind of thing."

00:29:58.040 --> 00:29:59.800
 Which is very mature of him, well done.

00:29:59.800 --> 00:30:00.880
 - The guy was then imprisoned

00:30:00.880 --> 00:30:03.400
 and I think beaten very badly.

00:30:03.400 --> 00:30:05.480
 - He asked a lot of tea, I think.

00:30:05.480 --> 00:30:07.680
 - I think it was by the Iraqi authorities,

00:30:07.680 --> 00:30:08.520
 rather than by anyone else.

00:30:08.520 --> 00:30:10.860
 But yes, it was a sentiment bang on.

00:30:10.860 --> 00:30:13.180
 - They did a massive shoe statue, didn't they?

00:30:13.180 --> 00:30:14.020
 Statue.

00:30:14.020 --> 00:30:14.840
 - Didn't they?

00:30:14.840 --> 00:30:15.680
 - Yeah.

00:30:15.680 --> 00:30:16.520
 - Nice.

00:30:16.520 --> 00:30:17.360
 - Wait, who's in Iraq?

00:30:17.360 --> 00:30:18.200
 - In Iraq, yeah.

00:30:18.200 --> 00:30:20.320
 But it was done, I think it was done at a university

00:30:20.320 --> 00:30:21.860
 or something and they had to take it down

00:30:21.860 --> 00:30:24.020
 'cause it was seen as being political.

00:30:24.020 --> 00:30:24.860
 - When they tore it down,

00:30:24.860 --> 00:30:25.700
 did they run over and beat it

00:30:25.700 --> 00:30:27.360
 with miniature statues of Saddam Hussein?

00:30:27.360 --> 00:30:30.100
 (laughing)

00:30:30.100 --> 00:30:32.300
 - I love that the museum in America

00:30:32.300 --> 00:30:35.940
 that has, as one of its exhibits, a replica of the shoe.

00:30:35.940 --> 00:30:36.780
 - Oh, really?

00:30:36.780 --> 00:30:37.620
 Not even the shoe?

00:30:37.620 --> 00:30:39.880
 - No, the shoes were destroyed by the CIA.

00:30:39.880 --> 00:30:40.720
 - Right.

00:30:40.720 --> 00:30:43.060
 - Sorry, I've never sounded more conspiracies

00:30:43.060 --> 00:30:44.320
 and winged that whack-off.

00:30:44.320 --> 00:30:46.220
 Sorry, but they actually were,

00:30:46.220 --> 00:30:48.520
 because I think they didn't want the shoes to become martyrs.

00:30:48.520 --> 00:30:51.400
 - Do the CIA need to be drafted into destroy shoes?

00:30:51.400 --> 00:30:52.740
 I reckon you get the intern.

00:30:52.740 --> 00:30:53.560
 - Maybe it was the FBI.

00:30:53.560 --> 00:30:54.400
 - Or the Secret Service, maybe.

00:30:54.400 --> 00:30:56.460
 - It was the Secret Service, sorry, it was the Secret Service.

00:30:56.460 --> 00:30:57.900
 But it became big business as well.

00:30:57.900 --> 00:30:59.900
 All these rival cobalas in the area started claiming,

00:30:59.900 --> 00:31:02.000
 "Oh yes, that's our shoe."

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:02.840
 - Really?

00:31:02.840 --> 00:31:03.680
 - Yeah.

00:31:03.680 --> 00:31:06.340
 And the thrower, Mundar al-Zaidi,

00:31:06.340 --> 00:31:09.900
 he was offered a couple of hands in marriage

00:31:09.900 --> 00:31:11.940
 by various people who said,

00:31:11.940 --> 00:31:14.020
 "I'd like you to marry my daughter."

00:31:14.020 --> 00:31:16.720
 And then, in 2009, he was doing an event,

00:31:16.720 --> 00:31:19.380
 the year after he did the thing, guess what happened?

00:31:19.380 --> 00:31:20.220
 - You got a shoe thrown at him?

00:31:20.220 --> 00:31:21.320
 - He got a shoe thrown at him.

00:31:21.320 --> 00:31:23.060
 Yeah, it was a real circle of life thing.

00:31:23.060 --> 00:31:25.360
 - Come up and buy Bush, or?

00:31:25.360 --> 00:31:26.360
 - Not buy Bush.

00:31:26.360 --> 00:31:28.400
 (all laughing)

00:31:28.400 --> 00:31:30.460
 - But Bush has had more shoes thrown at him since.

00:31:30.460 --> 00:31:32.200
 There's a whole, I mean, it became a thing

00:31:32.200 --> 00:31:33.860
 post that event generally.

00:31:33.860 --> 00:31:35.080
 So there's a whole Wikipedia page

00:31:35.080 --> 00:31:37.740
 where it's a shoe throwing incident, it's called,

00:31:37.740 --> 00:31:39.640
 and it gives you a big timeline,

00:31:39.640 --> 00:31:44.640
 and it really picks up after old mate Bush was attacked.

00:31:44.640 --> 00:31:46.600
 There's a famous incident as well.

00:31:46.600 --> 00:31:49.200
 Queen Elizabeth, the late Queen, in Australia.

00:31:49.200 --> 00:31:50.040
 - Second?

00:31:50.040 --> 00:31:50.880
 - Yeah.

00:31:50.880 --> 00:31:54.100
 She threw a shoe at Philip when they were in Australia.

00:31:54.100 --> 00:31:56.520
 It was one of the only moments where a fight,

00:31:56.520 --> 00:31:58.360
 I think in fact, the only incident in which a fight

00:31:58.360 --> 00:32:00.560
 was seen between Philip and the Queen,

00:32:00.560 --> 00:32:02.520
 she threw a tennis racket at him as well.

00:32:02.520 --> 00:32:03.720
 - A tennis racket?

00:32:03.720 --> 00:32:04.560
 - Yeah.

00:32:04.560 --> 00:32:06.320
 - The Aussies were filming from a distance,

00:32:06.320 --> 00:32:08.600
 and they were like, "Geez, what did we just see?"

00:32:08.600 --> 00:32:10.640
 'Cause we've never seen anything like that before.

00:32:10.640 --> 00:32:12.880
 And so one of the PR people had to come out for the Queen

00:32:12.880 --> 00:32:14.440
 and say, "What are you guys doing?"

00:32:14.440 --> 00:32:17.040
 With a British accent, they're like, "Oh, the Nazi accent."

00:32:17.040 --> 00:32:18.840
 And then the Queen came out, and she apologised,

00:32:18.840 --> 00:32:19.800
 and she said, "Where do you want me?"

00:32:19.800 --> 00:32:21.760
 As if to say, "Please don't use that.

00:32:21.760 --> 00:32:24.420
 "I'm here now as an embarrassing apology

00:32:24.420 --> 00:32:25.760
 "for you witnessing that."

00:32:25.760 --> 00:32:28.360
 But possibly she was wishing him good luck.

00:32:28.360 --> 00:32:29.600
 (all laughing)

00:32:29.600 --> 00:32:30.440
 - Or whatever affair.

00:32:30.440 --> 00:32:33.820
 - With a lucky tennis racket as well, yeah.

00:32:33.820 --> 00:32:35.800
 - All of your lucky clothes are out on the lawn.

00:32:35.800 --> 00:32:38.480
 (all laughing)

00:32:38.480 --> 00:32:39.320
 - That's so funny.

00:32:39.320 --> 00:32:40.240
 - Wow.

00:32:40.240 --> 00:32:41.400
 James, have you ever seen...

00:32:41.400 --> 00:32:43.080
 I'm asking James specifically this for a reason.

00:32:43.080 --> 00:32:44.920
 Have you ever seen a panty tree?

00:32:44.920 --> 00:32:46.600
 (all laughing)

00:32:46.600 --> 00:32:49.160
 - We know the reason, panty tree.

00:32:49.160 --> 00:32:51.400
 - No, but I think I can guess what it is.

00:32:51.400 --> 00:32:53.480
 Is it a tree where people leave their pants?

00:32:53.480 --> 00:32:54.320
 - That's right.

00:32:54.320 --> 00:32:56.040
 - Why would I have seen it?

00:32:56.040 --> 00:32:57.320
 - Why would you specifically, isn't it?

00:32:57.320 --> 00:32:58.800
 - Is it common in Bolton?

00:32:58.800 --> 00:33:00.040
 - It's not a Bolton thing.

00:33:00.040 --> 00:33:01.200
 - I bet it's a golf thing.

00:33:01.200 --> 00:33:02.800
 - Oh, it's a sporting thing.

00:33:03.800 --> 00:33:05.620
 - I thought it was just because James makes a habit

00:33:05.620 --> 00:33:07.700
 of visiting all the weird places in the world.

00:33:07.700 --> 00:33:08.540
 And it sounds weird.

00:33:08.540 --> 00:33:10.180
 - And it's a pervert.

00:33:10.180 --> 00:33:12.580
 Or maybe I'm like Tom Jones and wherever I walk,

00:33:12.580 --> 00:33:14.060
 people just throw pants at me.

00:33:14.060 --> 00:33:14.900
 - That's it.

00:33:14.900 --> 00:33:16.620
 - Whenever I'm walking in the forest.

00:33:16.620 --> 00:33:17.620
 (all laughing)

00:33:17.620 --> 00:33:19.500
 - You are the panty tree, actually.

00:33:19.500 --> 00:33:20.980
 (all laughing)

00:33:20.980 --> 00:33:23.060
 - No, the reason I asked is 'cause I know James

00:33:23.060 --> 00:33:24.940
 has been on a skiing holiday.

00:33:24.940 --> 00:33:25.780
 - Yeah.

00:33:25.780 --> 00:33:28.580
 - But I think you, probably all of you guys

00:33:28.580 --> 00:33:30.740
 in metropolitan elites are always skiing.

00:33:30.740 --> 00:33:33.160
 But no, apparently it's a thing on for a ski lift

00:33:33.160 --> 00:33:34.840
 because your ski lift goes very high, doesn't it?

00:33:34.840 --> 00:33:36.560
 And it passes over some trees.

00:33:36.560 --> 00:33:38.880
 And in some ski resorts, there are trees

00:33:38.880 --> 00:33:42.240
 where people chuck their panties onto the tree.

00:33:42.240 --> 00:33:43.080
 - I've seen that.

00:33:43.080 --> 00:33:45.400
 And I thought it was a Mardi Gras thing.

00:33:45.400 --> 00:33:46.480
 But there were loads.

00:33:46.480 --> 00:33:50.240
 And there was lots of sparkly, bras-y, panty.

00:33:50.240 --> 00:33:51.680
 Oh my God, and that's a thing.

00:33:51.680 --> 00:33:52.520
 - That's a thing.

00:33:52.520 --> 00:33:55.360
 I think they don't love it, the skiing authorities.

00:33:55.360 --> 00:33:56.680
 - Why do they care?

00:33:56.680 --> 00:33:57.520
 - I don't know.

00:33:57.520 --> 00:33:58.360
 (all laughing)

00:33:58.360 --> 00:33:59.200
 - Sorry, I don't know.

00:33:59.200 --> 00:34:00.040
 - What's their problem?

00:34:00.040 --> 00:34:00.860
 - It's hard to get your neck.

00:34:00.860 --> 00:34:01.700
 - Literate.

00:34:01.700 --> 00:34:02.540
 - Yeah, it is, yeah.

00:34:02.540 --> 00:34:03.380
 It must be hard to get your knickers off

00:34:03.380 --> 00:34:04.220
 on a ski lift though.

00:34:04.220 --> 00:34:05.060
 Like, that's a tough.

00:34:05.060 --> 00:34:06.220
 - I don't think they're doing that at all.

00:34:06.220 --> 00:34:07.540
 (all laughing)

00:34:07.540 --> 00:34:09.140
 - 'Cause you're wearing like your ski suit.

00:34:09.140 --> 00:34:09.980
 - Exactly.

00:34:09.980 --> 00:34:11.180
 - And you've gotta pull them off

00:34:11.180 --> 00:34:13.100
 and then pull them all over the ski.

00:34:13.100 --> 00:34:13.940
 - Exactly.

00:34:13.940 --> 00:34:14.780
 - I don't think it's possible.

00:34:14.780 --> 00:34:15.980
 - And your skis as well.

00:34:15.980 --> 00:34:17.100
 (all laughing)

00:34:17.100 --> 00:34:19.700
 - You have to take your skis off, they're gonna fall.

00:34:19.700 --> 00:34:20.540
 - Yeah.

00:34:20.540 --> 00:34:21.980
 - No, I reckon it's a spare pair of pants

00:34:21.980 --> 00:34:23.460
 situation in the pocket, isn't it?

00:34:23.460 --> 00:34:24.300
 - Very interesting.

00:34:24.300 --> 00:34:25.140
 - Probably is it.

00:34:25.140 --> 00:34:25.980
 - Very interesting.

00:34:25.980 --> 00:34:26.900
 - Yeah.

00:34:26.900 --> 00:34:29.600
 - I occasionally have dropped a ski pole

00:34:29.600 --> 00:34:32.200
 when going up on a ski lift as I'm sure many people have.

00:34:32.200 --> 00:34:34.040
 And obviously we hire our skis

00:34:34.040 --> 00:34:35.840
 and then we went back and we said,

00:34:35.840 --> 00:34:38.640
 "We dropped our ski pole, can we pay for the ski pole?"

00:34:38.640 --> 00:34:39.960
 They said, "Oh no, don't worry about it."

00:34:39.960 --> 00:34:42.020
 Because at the end of the season,

00:34:42.020 --> 00:34:43.520
 when all the snow melts,

00:34:43.520 --> 00:34:46.160
 someone goes up and collects all of the ski poles off

00:34:46.160 --> 00:34:48.720
 and then they just distribute them between all the shops.

00:34:48.720 --> 00:34:49.560
 - It's no way.

00:34:49.560 --> 00:34:50.400
 - That's amazing.

00:34:50.400 --> 00:34:51.240
 - I don't know if that's true.

00:34:51.240 --> 00:34:52.080
 - That's what they said.

00:34:52.080 --> 00:34:52.920
 - That's amazing.

00:34:52.920 --> 00:34:53.760
 - This was in Italy.

00:34:53.760 --> 00:34:55.560
 - It was fine, just give us your panties.

00:34:55.560 --> 00:34:56.520
 Give us your panties, mate.

00:34:56.520 --> 00:34:59.160
 - In 2016, MPs in the Egyptian parliament

00:34:59.160 --> 00:35:00.360
 attacked each other with shoes,

00:35:00.360 --> 00:35:02.140
 or one attacked another with a shoe.

00:35:02.140 --> 00:35:04.480
 Which I think is quite sorry.

00:35:04.480 --> 00:35:07.480
 - It's a big drop down from a mass shoe wall.

00:35:07.480 --> 00:35:08.320
 - No, it wasn't.

00:35:08.320 --> 00:35:10.100
 The other one wasn't quick enough off the mark

00:35:10.100 --> 00:35:11.200
 taking his shoe off.

00:35:11.200 --> 00:35:12.700
 He was actually suspended,

00:35:12.700 --> 00:35:13.900
 which I don't know why I sound surprised.

00:35:13.900 --> 00:35:15.980
 I suppose you probably would be from our parliament as well.

00:35:15.980 --> 00:35:17.820
 - Did they run with the headline,

00:35:17.820 --> 00:35:20.540
 S open brackets, C closed brackets,

00:35:20.540 --> 00:35:21.380
 Andal.

00:35:21.380 --> 00:35:22.380
 - Ssss.

00:35:22.380 --> 00:35:23.220
 - Ssandal.

00:35:23.220 --> 00:35:24.040
 - Ssandal.

00:35:24.040 --> 00:35:24.880
 - Oh yeah.

00:35:24.880 --> 00:35:25.720
 - Ssandal.

00:35:25.720 --> 00:35:27.440
 - Gosh, that took us all a long time, didn't it?

00:35:27.440 --> 00:35:28.600
 - That was, yeah.

00:35:28.600 --> 00:35:29.940
 - No, 'cause I suppose it would have been written

00:35:29.940 --> 00:35:30.780
 in Turkish, so.

00:35:30.780 --> 00:35:33.440
 (all laughing)

00:35:33.440 --> 00:35:35.520
 - But yeah, it sounds like a very exciting moment.

00:35:35.520 --> 00:35:38.480
 Tolfik Okasha was the MP who got attacked by a shoe

00:35:38.480 --> 00:35:40.080
 because he'd had the Israeli envoy round,

00:35:40.080 --> 00:35:42.400
 and one of his fellow MPs objected to that,

00:35:42.400 --> 00:35:45.080
 and got angry and hit him with a shoe,

00:35:45.080 --> 00:35:47.600
 and had to be escorted from the house waving a shoe.

00:35:47.600 --> 00:35:48.760
 I just thought that's a fun addition

00:35:48.760 --> 00:35:51.360
 to parliamentary goings on if we want to try it out.

00:35:51.360 --> 00:35:52.200
 - Yeah.

00:35:52.200 --> 00:35:53.480
 - There's a bit of an irony about Queen Victoria

00:35:53.480 --> 00:35:55.840
 showing the shoes at the Crimean War soldiers,

00:35:55.840 --> 00:35:59.400
 which is that they had very bad shoe situations

00:35:59.400 --> 00:36:00.720
 when they got to the war.

00:36:00.720 --> 00:36:01.560
 - Oh, nice.

00:36:01.560 --> 00:36:02.400
 - Wow, I froze there badly.

00:36:02.400 --> 00:36:04.020
 - They should have kept that one shoe.

00:36:04.020 --> 00:36:04.860
 - Well, yeah.

00:36:04.860 --> 00:36:07.680
 They had awful boots, and they got trench foot,

00:36:07.680 --> 00:36:10.200
 their feet swelled up in the cold.

00:36:10.200 --> 00:36:11.320
 The clothing was completely awful.

00:36:11.320 --> 00:36:13.020
 Sometimes the sole of their shoe would just stick

00:36:13.020 --> 00:36:15.320
 to the mud as they lifted their foot up,

00:36:15.320 --> 00:36:16.720
 and the rest of the shoe came,

00:36:16.720 --> 00:36:18.400
 and the sole was left behind,

00:36:18.400 --> 00:36:20.120
 'cause the mud was very thick and sticky.

00:36:20.120 --> 00:36:20.960
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:36:20.960 --> 00:36:22.240
 - Really bad, yeah, yeah.

00:36:22.240 --> 00:36:23.960
 They had a horrible time.

00:36:23.960 --> 00:36:25.560
 - Yeah, it was a tough one.

00:36:25.560 --> 00:36:26.640
 - It was a tough war.

00:36:26.640 --> 00:36:27.480
 - Oh.

00:36:27.480 --> 00:36:28.320
 - It was many of them are.

00:36:28.320 --> 00:36:30.040
 - What were the years, the Crimean War?

00:36:30.040 --> 00:36:32.320
 - 1853 to six.

00:36:32.320 --> 00:36:33.160
 - Yeah, as Anna said.

00:36:33.160 --> 00:36:34.000
 - Three to six.

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:34.840
 - Three to six.

00:36:34.840 --> 00:36:35.660
 - Three to six.

00:36:35.660 --> 00:36:36.500
 - Three to six, yeah.

00:36:36.500 --> 00:36:37.720
 - 1853 to six.

00:36:37.720 --> 00:36:38.560
 - Yeah.

00:36:38.560 --> 00:36:39.400
 - Sorry.

00:36:39.400 --> 00:36:40.220
 - Right.

00:36:40.220 --> 00:36:42.040
 - And it was a very complicated war.

00:36:42.040 --> 00:36:45.240
 - Yeah, it was basically a blue sash orange

00:36:45.240 --> 00:36:48.400
 about the West trying to limit Russian expansionism,

00:36:48.400 --> 00:36:49.240
 wasn't it?

00:36:49.240 --> 00:36:50.920
 - It's basically the Ottomans coming up

00:36:50.920 --> 00:36:54.360
 to the North, the Russians coming out to the West,

00:36:54.360 --> 00:36:56.720
 Britain and France having colonial things

00:36:56.720 --> 00:36:58.480
 that they didn't want to lose,

00:36:58.480 --> 00:37:00.600
 trying to keep Russia as quiet as possible,

00:37:00.600 --> 00:37:03.600
 and decided to get on the side of the Ottomans,

00:37:03.600 --> 00:37:06.760
 and then attack the underbelly, which is Crimea.

00:37:06.760 --> 00:37:07.600
 - Yeah.

00:37:07.600 --> 00:37:09.000
 - And also there were a lot of Ottomans

00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:10.280
 living in Crimea at the time,

00:37:10.280 --> 00:37:12.280
 so it was a bit of a powder keg anyway.

00:37:12.280 --> 00:37:14.680
 - It was a very, very complicated situation.

00:37:14.680 --> 00:37:16.360
 Anyway, it started over rights of access

00:37:16.360 --> 00:37:18.880
 to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem,

00:37:18.880 --> 00:37:19.960
 which I think we talked about.

00:37:19.960 --> 00:37:21.840
 Isn't that the one where they have the disagreement

00:37:21.840 --> 00:37:22.680
 over the ladder?

00:37:22.680 --> 00:37:23.520
 - It is.

00:37:23.520 --> 00:37:24.360
 - Yeah.

00:37:24.360 --> 00:37:25.560
 - And this was the same thing, basically.

00:37:25.560 --> 00:37:27.480
 The Ottoman Sultan gave the Catholic priests

00:37:27.480 --> 00:37:29.440
 a key to the Church in 1852.

00:37:29.440 --> 00:37:31.240
 And from that point on, you know, it was like,

00:37:31.240 --> 00:37:33.080
 well, we have to have a war over this.

00:37:33.080 --> 00:37:34.720
 Basically things escalated from there.

00:37:34.720 --> 00:37:35.880
 And then suddenly you have got the charge

00:37:35.880 --> 00:37:36.720
 of the Light Brigade happening,

00:37:36.720 --> 00:37:38.000
 and it's all going disastrously wrong.

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:38.840
 - Yeah.

00:37:38.840 --> 00:37:39.880
 - And Florence Nightingale's having to organize

00:37:39.880 --> 00:37:40.720
 a lot of stuff.

00:37:40.720 --> 00:37:42.560
 - I mean, lots of famous things came from it, I suppose.

00:37:42.560 --> 00:37:44.200
 Florence Nightingale, Mary Seacull,

00:37:44.200 --> 00:37:45.360
 charge of the Light Brigade.

00:37:45.360 --> 00:37:46.640
 - Three items of clothing.

00:37:46.640 --> 00:37:50.240
 Balaklava, the cardigan.

00:37:50.240 --> 00:37:51.640
 - Cardigan, Earl of Cardigan,

00:37:51.640 --> 00:37:53.240
 very heavily involved in the Light Brigade.

00:37:53.240 --> 00:37:54.320
 - It's gotta be a boot.

00:37:54.320 --> 00:37:55.440
 - You're not gonna get it.

00:37:55.440 --> 00:37:56.280
 - Go on, what is it?

00:37:56.280 --> 00:37:57.560
 - The Sebastopol hat.

00:37:57.560 --> 00:37:59.840
 (laughing)

00:37:59.840 --> 00:38:02.240
 - It's the Raglan sleeve shirt.

00:38:02.240 --> 00:38:03.560
 - What's that?

00:38:03.560 --> 00:38:04.800
 - It's got a different color of,

00:38:04.800 --> 00:38:06.880
 the torso is a different color to the sleeves.

00:38:06.880 --> 00:38:08.320
 It's a baseball jersey.

00:38:08.320 --> 00:38:12.000
 But General Fitzroy Somerset, the first Baron Raglan,

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:13.400
 was not wearing a baseball jersey,

00:38:13.400 --> 00:38:15.160
 but it didn't have a Raglan sleeve shirt named after him.

00:38:15.160 --> 00:38:16.720
 And he was the one who was responsible

00:38:16.720 --> 00:38:18.520
 for the charge of the Light Brigade going so badly wrong.

00:38:18.520 --> 00:38:19.360
 - Right.

00:38:19.360 --> 00:38:20.440
 - He was very old and he was half deaf

00:38:20.440 --> 00:38:22.280
 and he was not really with it.

00:38:22.280 --> 00:38:24.440
 And he said, oh, the Russians are taking some guns over there.

00:38:24.440 --> 00:38:26.360
 Can you go and stop them taking away the guns?

00:38:26.360 --> 00:38:28.880
 And the order was then carried to someone else,

00:38:28.880 --> 00:38:30.040
 the Earl of Cardigan,

00:38:30.040 --> 00:38:31.400
 who could not see the guns

00:38:31.400 --> 00:38:32.680
 'cause he was somewhere completely different.

00:38:32.680 --> 00:38:33.920
 And he said, well, those guns,

00:38:33.920 --> 00:38:36.920
 and pointed at this incredibly well-defended gun in place,

00:38:36.920 --> 00:38:38.760
 but at the end of a long, narrow valley,

00:38:38.760 --> 00:38:40.800
 just a disastrous place to attack.

00:38:40.800 --> 00:38:44.880
 And he said, okay, this isn't gonna go well,

00:38:44.880 --> 00:38:45.800
 but fine.

00:38:45.800 --> 00:38:47.120
 - Don Yacardi's.

00:38:47.120 --> 00:38:47.960
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:38:47.960 --> 00:38:48.800
 Here's the exact words where,

00:38:48.800 --> 00:38:50.200
 here goes the last of the Brudenells

00:38:50.200 --> 00:38:51.640
 'cause he thought he was just riding straight

00:38:51.640 --> 00:38:54.960
 to a certain death as a lot of the people in that charge were.

00:38:54.960 --> 00:38:57.160
 - Here's another thing that wasn't invented,

00:38:57.160 --> 00:38:59.440
 but someone tried to invent for the Crimea,

00:38:59.440 --> 00:39:03.320
 which was a entire city destroying cannon.

00:39:03.320 --> 00:39:04.880
 This is a massive cannon.

00:39:04.880 --> 00:39:06.240
 It was 10 meters wide.

00:39:06.240 --> 00:39:07.720
 The shot is 10 meters wide.

00:39:07.720 --> 00:39:08.560
 - No.

00:39:08.560 --> 00:39:10.560
 - And it would weigh 550 tons.

00:39:10.560 --> 00:39:12.040
 And the idea is that once it landed,

00:39:12.040 --> 00:39:14.160
 it would demolish an entire city.

00:39:14.160 --> 00:39:16.920
 And it was to be called the Saxo Cannon.

00:39:16.920 --> 00:39:19.320
 - How are they gonna transport that anywhere?

00:39:19.320 --> 00:39:20.160
 - Yeah.

00:39:20.160 --> 00:39:23.720
 - It's a wacky racer's Acme Roadrunner-style cannon,

00:39:23.720 --> 00:39:24.560
 they're making.

00:39:24.560 --> 00:39:25.560
 - The inventor was a solid inventor.

00:39:25.560 --> 00:39:26.640
 - Was it not Adolf Sax?

00:39:26.640 --> 00:39:30.160
 - It was, the inventor of the saxophone came up

00:39:30.160 --> 00:39:32.040
 with a city destroying cannon,

00:39:32.040 --> 00:39:33.440
 which he really wanted to build.

00:39:33.440 --> 00:39:34.560
 - He was such a weird guy.

00:39:34.560 --> 00:39:35.760
 He would just invent these things

00:39:35.760 --> 00:39:38.400
 and then just call it the Sax something.

00:39:38.400 --> 00:39:39.240
 - Exactly.

00:39:39.240 --> 00:39:40.640
 - So never, it didn't take off.

00:39:40.640 --> 00:39:42.920
 - No, didn't get past the planning stages.

00:39:42.920 --> 00:39:43.740
 - No.

00:39:43.740 --> 00:39:44.580
 - That's what we wanted to do.

00:39:44.580 --> 00:39:46.160
 - Take off, very nice.

00:39:46.160 --> 00:39:50.800
 - Something else the Chromium War gave us is,

00:39:50.800 --> 00:39:52.640
 I think the earliest war photography,

00:39:52.640 --> 00:39:54.800
 or some of the earliest war photography,

00:39:54.800 --> 00:39:58.600
 very famous photo of the Valley of the Shadow of Death

00:39:58.600 --> 00:40:00.640
 by Roger Fenton in 1855.

00:40:00.640 --> 00:40:02.680
 I think it's one of the earliest pictures of warfare.

00:40:02.680 --> 00:40:03.880
 Basically, there are two photos

00:40:03.880 --> 00:40:05.400
 of the Valley of the Shadow of Death.

00:40:05.400 --> 00:40:08.720
 And they're both of this extremely barren landscape,

00:40:08.720 --> 00:40:10.560
 very near where the Charger Library was,

00:40:10.560 --> 00:40:14.360
 and gravel, little valley slopes on each side.

00:40:14.360 --> 00:40:16.160
 One of them has some cannonballs on the floor,

00:40:16.160 --> 00:40:17.200
 one of them doesn't,

00:40:17.200 --> 00:40:19.640
 and the famous one is the one with the cannonballs.

00:40:19.640 --> 00:40:22.120
 And it's the, you know, sort of tragedy of war

00:40:22.120 --> 00:40:25.080
 and the emptiness of the landscape with these war weapons.

00:40:25.080 --> 00:40:28.960
 But there's been so much debate over the last 150 years

00:40:28.960 --> 00:40:30.120
 over whether he faked it.

00:40:30.120 --> 00:40:31.880
 Like, where did the cannonballs come from?

00:40:31.880 --> 00:40:34.680
 - Well, Sax, I think, prototypes.

00:40:34.680 --> 00:40:36.320
 (all laughing)

00:40:36.320 --> 00:40:37.920
 - His marbles, weren't they?

00:40:37.920 --> 00:40:40.240
 (all laughing)

00:40:40.240 --> 00:40:41.240
 And we don't know, 'cause it might be

00:40:41.240 --> 00:40:43.440
 that the second photo is after they'd cleared it up.

00:40:43.440 --> 00:40:45.160
 So then they just took another one of it clean.

00:40:45.160 --> 00:40:46.840
 - Right, or he might have deposited.

00:40:46.840 --> 00:40:47.680
 Ooh, tricky.

00:40:47.680 --> 00:40:49.600
 - The thing was, 'cause he took a lot of photos, right?

00:40:49.600 --> 00:40:51.120
 He had a horse and carriage with him,

00:40:51.120 --> 00:40:54.680
 which was like a portable photo developing booth

00:40:54.680 --> 00:40:55.960
 that he had with him.

00:40:55.960 --> 00:40:58.000
 He had lots of glass slides that he had

00:40:58.000 --> 00:40:59.480
 with him, multiple cameras.

00:40:59.480 --> 00:41:01.800
 And everyone's saying, oh, he staged a lot of photos.

00:41:01.800 --> 00:41:04.600
 I think it's more than just the cannonball one.

00:41:04.600 --> 00:41:07.680
 And the problem is, of course, they were staged.

00:41:07.680 --> 00:41:09.440
 Everything had to be staged.

00:41:09.440 --> 00:41:10.840
 - 'Cause you needed a long exposure time.

00:41:10.840 --> 00:41:12.560
 - The exposure was like 30 seconds.

00:41:12.560 --> 00:41:14.080
 - It's actually why the charge of the labricade

00:41:14.080 --> 00:41:15.880
 was such a disastrous, 'cause they had to wait

00:41:15.880 --> 00:41:17.920
 for half a minute for the photo.

00:41:17.920 --> 00:41:19.480
 The team photo at the start.

00:41:19.480 --> 00:41:20.800
 - And someone was blinking.

00:41:20.800 --> 00:41:22.280
 (all laughing)

00:41:22.280 --> 00:41:24.860
 (upbeat music)

00:41:24.860 --> 00:41:29.960
 - Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show,

00:41:29.960 --> 00:41:31.560
 and that is Andy.

00:41:31.560 --> 00:41:34.080
 - My fact is, there is a chameleon in Madagascar,

00:41:34.080 --> 00:41:38.600
 which is effectively extinct for several months every year.

00:41:39.600 --> 00:41:41.040
 This fact is incredible.

00:41:41.040 --> 00:41:41.880
 - It's insane.

00:41:41.880 --> 00:41:42.720
 - Yeah, it's really good.

00:41:42.720 --> 00:41:43.560
 - I think it's not true.

00:41:43.560 --> 00:41:46.200
 I think if you're extinct, come back three months later,

00:41:46.200 --> 00:41:47.040
 you're not extinct.

00:41:47.040 --> 00:41:48.040
 - Let's debate the case.

00:41:48.040 --> 00:41:49.520
 (all laughing)

00:41:49.520 --> 00:41:51.360
 And first of all, thanks to Kate Wood,

00:41:51.360 --> 00:41:54.440
 who sent us in, in the email, "the fish in the box."

00:41:54.440 --> 00:41:56.600
 - If I knew it was from you, as opposed to Andy,

00:41:56.600 --> 00:41:57.760
 I wouldn't have poo pooed it.

00:41:57.760 --> 00:41:58.640
 - No, no, no.

00:41:58.640 --> 00:42:02.720
 This is the Labord's chameleon, and it is crazy.

00:42:02.720 --> 00:42:05.840
 Right, so, November, the chameleon hatches out.

00:42:05.840 --> 00:42:06.680
 - Yes.

00:42:06.680 --> 00:42:09.360
 - In Madagascar, in the forest.

00:42:09.360 --> 00:42:11.640
 Then they grow to sexual maturity very fast.

00:42:11.640 --> 00:42:15.640
 In about two months, they are grown up, ready to breed.

00:42:15.640 --> 00:42:18.480
 They breed, the females lay some eggs in the ground.

00:42:18.480 --> 00:42:20.760
 Then in March, they all die.

00:42:20.760 --> 00:42:21.600
 - Not the eggs, the adults.

00:42:21.600 --> 00:42:23.040
 - All the adults die.

00:42:23.040 --> 00:42:26.080
 There are then, the entire species exists in egg form,

00:42:26.080 --> 00:42:28.240
 basically, for most of the year.

00:42:28.240 --> 00:42:30.720
 In November, eggs hatch out, on they go.

00:42:30.720 --> 00:42:34.120
 - It's so weird, it's so weird, for most of the year,

00:42:34.120 --> 00:42:35.320
 yeah, they're not extinct exactly,

00:42:35.320 --> 00:42:37.920
 but for most of the year, the species lives in,

00:42:37.920 --> 00:42:38.760
 as an egg.

00:42:38.760 --> 00:42:41.160
 - Must be weird for the first person to come out of the egg.

00:42:41.160 --> 00:42:42.000
 - Yeah.

00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:42.820
 - Every year.

00:42:42.820 --> 00:42:43.660
 - Oh my God, yeah.

00:42:43.660 --> 00:42:45.680
 - They learn nothing from their elders?

00:42:45.680 --> 00:42:46.640
 I just think these are bizarre.

00:42:46.640 --> 00:42:48.360
 These were discovered in 2008.

00:42:48.360 --> 00:42:50.320
 I think their life cycle was first reported.

00:42:50.320 --> 00:42:51.720
 I think since then, they have found that

00:42:51.720 --> 00:42:53.360
 if you keep some in captivity,

00:42:53.360 --> 00:42:55.200
 or maybe under very specific conditions,

00:42:55.200 --> 00:42:57.040
 one might make it through a year.

00:42:57.040 --> 00:42:58.360
 But it's really, really rare.

00:42:58.360 --> 00:42:59.200
 So it's--

00:42:59.200 --> 00:43:00.880
 - What a year 2008 was.

00:43:00.880 --> 00:43:03.080
 Over in India, you had someone being killed on TV

00:43:03.080 --> 00:43:05.720
 with mind power, or not, or not.

00:43:05.720 --> 00:43:06.560
 - In Iraq.

00:43:06.560 --> 00:43:08.720
 - You had a chameleon being extinct, or not.

00:43:08.720 --> 00:43:11.300
 - In Iraq, George Bush is getting a tooth run at him.

00:43:11.300 --> 00:43:12.140
 - Wow.

00:43:12.140 --> 00:43:12.960
 - What?

00:43:12.960 --> 00:43:14.360
 - What was Anthony Trollup doing that year?

00:43:14.360 --> 00:43:16.400
 (all laughing)

00:43:16.400 --> 00:43:17.920
 - No, and they're amazing.

00:43:17.920 --> 00:43:20.720
 And I think it's 'cause they die to avoid the dry season,

00:43:20.720 --> 00:43:23.600
 which is very harsh and very, very hot in Madagascar.

00:43:23.600 --> 00:43:26.240
 And they just, some species hibernate,

00:43:26.240 --> 00:43:27.960
 they just decide to die.

00:43:27.960 --> 00:43:29.360
 And lots of chameleons on Madagascar,

00:43:29.360 --> 00:43:31.400
 I think they've got about--

00:43:31.400 --> 00:43:32.480
 - They've got almost half, haven't they?

00:43:32.480 --> 00:43:34.240
 - Almost half, what's the percentage of something?

00:43:34.240 --> 00:43:35.080
 - Yeah.

00:43:35.080 --> 00:43:36.400
 - Extraordinary variety of estimates

00:43:36.400 --> 00:43:38.040
 as to the number of chameleon species.

00:43:38.040 --> 00:43:40.720
 Given that it feels like a very small, countable number,

00:43:40.720 --> 00:43:43.160
 I read anywhere, and all from very reputable sources,

00:43:43.160 --> 00:43:48.000
 anywhere between 134 and more than 217 species of chameleon.

00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:49.080
 - Well, they're different colors, aren't they?

00:43:49.080 --> 00:43:50.080
 It's very hard to tell, you know?

00:43:50.080 --> 00:43:50.920
 - Yeah, yeah, that's a good point.

00:43:50.920 --> 00:43:52.280
 - Well, this was a green one before.

00:43:52.280 --> 00:43:53.120
 (all laughing)

00:43:53.120 --> 00:43:55.340
 Or is it a different one?

00:43:55.340 --> 00:43:56.180
 - They're great.

00:43:56.180 --> 00:43:57.800
 - Yeah, they don't change their color to match their background.

00:43:57.800 --> 00:43:58.840
 I actually didn't know that

00:43:58.840 --> 00:44:01.080
 until reading it for this podcast.

00:44:01.080 --> 00:44:01.920
 - Right.

00:44:01.920 --> 00:44:02.760
 - They change their emotions.

00:44:02.760 --> 00:44:04.760
 - Yeah, no, I think that's amazing.

00:44:04.760 --> 00:44:06.600
 An amazing misconception.

00:44:06.600 --> 00:44:08.720
 It's one of the biggest ones we've debunked on QI.

00:44:08.720 --> 00:44:10.760
 You know, sometimes we debunk things that you think,

00:44:10.760 --> 00:44:12.160
 yeah, come on, that's a bit.

00:44:12.160 --> 00:44:13.160
 - No, we never do that.

00:44:13.160 --> 00:44:15.160
 - No, we never do that, we never do that.

00:44:15.160 --> 00:44:16.520
 - There's an amazing thing.

00:44:16.520 --> 00:44:20.840
 If you were watching the UFC of chameleon battles, right?

00:44:20.840 --> 00:44:22.880
 Two competitors enter the ring.

00:44:22.880 --> 00:44:25.360
 If you were betting, you could probably bet

00:44:25.360 --> 00:44:27.840
 in the last few seconds, if that was allowed,

00:44:27.840 --> 00:44:29.400
 on who was gonna win.

00:44:29.400 --> 00:44:31.200
 - Do they change color based on whether they think

00:44:31.200 --> 00:44:32.040
 they're gonna win or lose?

00:44:32.040 --> 00:44:33.960
 - When they pass each other in the street,

00:44:33.960 --> 00:44:37.040
 two males were often changed colors to sort of be like,

00:44:37.040 --> 00:44:39.120
 kind of like if you're walking poolside

00:44:39.120 --> 00:44:42.520
 and you tuck your tummy in and walk in that kind of thing.

00:44:42.520 --> 00:44:46.040
 So yeah, so they found when they were studying it

00:44:46.040 --> 00:44:48.840
 that the chameleon that was brighter

00:44:48.840 --> 00:44:52.440
 and changed more rapidly was the one who was gonna win.

00:44:52.440 --> 00:44:54.200
 And they just found that that on average

00:44:54.200 --> 00:44:55.320
 was the way that it happened.

00:44:55.320 --> 00:44:56.640
 Yeah, or above average.

00:44:56.640 --> 00:44:58.840
 - So what a useful way, if only we could tell them that,

00:44:58.840 --> 00:45:00.120
 then they never have to fight, right?

00:45:00.120 --> 00:45:01.240
 - They can always just go up to each other and go.

00:45:01.240 --> 00:45:02.080
 - Stop the match.

00:45:02.080 --> 00:45:02.920
 - Oh, okay.

00:45:02.920 --> 00:45:04.240
 - Throw the towel in, yeah.

00:45:04.240 --> 00:45:05.080
 - Exactly.

00:45:05.080 --> 00:45:05.920
 - Wow.

00:45:05.920 --> 00:45:08.040
 - If you were a chameleon in a boxing ring or something,

00:45:08.040 --> 00:45:09.400
 'cause you normally wear a little dressing gown,

00:45:09.400 --> 00:45:10.840
 don't you, into the ring.

00:45:10.840 --> 00:45:12.360
 And as soon as you take your dressing gown off,

00:45:12.360 --> 00:45:13.960
 you look down, you were confident

00:45:13.960 --> 00:45:16.520
 until you saw how bright and stripy the other guy is.

00:45:16.520 --> 00:45:17.360
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:45:17.360 --> 00:45:19.520
 - I should just quickly say, this was in 2013,

00:45:19.520 --> 00:45:21.720
 it was a guy called Russell Ligon and Kevin McGrew,

00:45:21.720 --> 00:45:23.960
 and they did 45 encounters that they monitored.

00:45:23.960 --> 00:45:25.280
 And that's what they discovered from it.

00:45:25.280 --> 00:45:26.120
 - That's very cool.

00:45:26.120 --> 00:45:26.960
 - Yeah.

00:45:26.960 --> 00:45:28.560
 - They've got amazing anatomy.

00:45:28.560 --> 00:45:31.480
 I didn't know about the shape of their feet at all.

00:45:31.480 --> 00:45:32.320
 And they are bizarre.

00:45:32.320 --> 00:45:34.840
 They are described often as looking like salad tongs.

00:45:34.840 --> 00:45:35.680
 - Oh, yeah.

00:45:35.680 --> 00:45:36.520
 - And they do.

00:45:36.520 --> 00:45:39.960
 So there are two pads opposite each other.

00:45:39.960 --> 00:45:44.400
 And in fact, they're the only animals who aren't birds,

00:45:44.400 --> 00:45:47.080
 who are zygodactylists,

00:45:47.080 --> 00:45:50.640
 which basically means that they have three fingers,

00:45:50.640 --> 00:45:52.840
 opposite two fingers in a certain way.

00:45:52.840 --> 00:45:54.760
 And they're not the same kind of zygodactylists,

00:45:54.760 --> 00:45:55.760
 really, as birds.

00:45:55.760 --> 00:45:57.200
 They're their own special thing.

00:45:57.200 --> 00:45:58.440
 And essentially it's to grip trees.

00:45:58.440 --> 00:46:00.120
 I don't know why more things don't have this.

00:46:00.120 --> 00:46:02.440
 So it looks like a sideways claw

00:46:02.440 --> 00:46:04.160
 that just clamps onto trees.

00:46:04.160 --> 00:46:05.280
 It's very clever.

00:46:05.280 --> 00:46:07.400
 But I did find out that you can also get

00:46:07.400 --> 00:46:12.400
 pamperodactyly, anisodactyly, and schizo-dactylies as well,

00:46:12.400 --> 00:46:15.760
 which are in primate schizo-dactylies,

00:46:15.760 --> 00:46:18.360
 grasped with their second and third digits.

00:46:18.360 --> 00:46:19.880
 What's we're doing instead of thumb and finger?

00:46:19.880 --> 00:46:22.640
 - Like doing scissors for a rock paper scissors.

00:46:22.640 --> 00:46:23.800
 - Exactly.

00:46:23.800 --> 00:46:26.520
 - Does that free you up to hold something, like food?

00:46:26.520 --> 00:46:28.600
 - Or do you like a thumbs up at the same time

00:46:28.600 --> 00:46:29.760
 as holding onto the tree?

00:46:29.760 --> 00:46:31.360
 - I think that's the idea, yeah.

00:46:31.360 --> 00:46:32.240
 - And you can hold a can of paper

00:46:32.240 --> 00:46:33.480
 between fingers four and five.

00:46:33.480 --> 00:46:34.840
 - Yeah, perfect.

00:46:34.840 --> 00:46:36.960
 - No, they are, they're great.

00:46:36.960 --> 00:46:38.640
 I know someone who's got a peck of media.

00:46:38.640 --> 00:46:39.480
 - Do you?

00:46:39.480 --> 00:46:40.320
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:46:40.320 --> 00:46:42.880
 - Is that the end of the Alec Dope?

00:46:42.880 --> 00:46:44.000
 - I think it is.

00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:47.840
 - I'm rummaging for more, but that really is about it.

00:46:47.840 --> 00:46:48.840
 It's called Roy.

00:46:48.840 --> 00:46:50.720
 - Oh, there was more, there was more.

00:46:50.720 --> 00:46:54.360
 - No, and that's the end of the Alec Dope, yeah.

00:46:54.360 --> 00:46:56.600
 - If you were sitting on a chameleon's tongue

00:46:56.600 --> 00:46:58.600
 when it ate something.

00:46:58.600 --> 00:46:59.440
 - Food for thought, yeah.

00:46:59.440 --> 00:47:02.000
 - You would die so badly.

00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:04.440
 - No, no, it would just not be able to eat anything

00:47:04.440 --> 00:47:06.680
 because you're way bigger than a chameleon.

00:47:06.680 --> 00:47:08.520
 If you're sitting on its tongue,

00:47:08.520 --> 00:47:10.080
 it's not gonna be eating anything.

00:47:10.080 --> 00:47:11.200
 - Sorry, you're right.

00:47:11.200 --> 00:47:13.160
 You have to imagine that you're the size of a borrower

00:47:13.160 --> 00:47:14.240
 or maybe even smaller.

00:47:14.240 --> 00:47:15.080
 - Oh, okay.

00:47:15.080 --> 00:47:15.920
 - Of an ant.

00:47:15.920 --> 00:47:16.760
 Oh yeah, sorry.

00:47:16.760 --> 00:47:18.240
 Well, we'll see if you sit on a chameleon's tongue,

00:47:18.240 --> 00:47:20.600
 it'll just crush its tongue because you're human size.

00:47:20.600 --> 00:47:22.200
 - No, but like, you know, if something bites you,

00:47:22.200 --> 00:47:23.040
 a bite could have venom

00:47:23.040 --> 00:47:24.920
 and I thought the reveal was gonna be the tongue would.

00:47:24.920 --> 00:47:25.760
 - Sorry, it wasn't.

00:47:25.760 --> 00:47:27.120
 It was the acceleration of their tongues.

00:47:27.120 --> 00:47:28.840
 I should have made clear that you've been shrunken

00:47:28.840 --> 00:47:30.160
 like honey eye shots with kids in this.

00:47:30.160 --> 00:47:32.120
 - Yeah, I think that was a big central bit of that story.

00:47:32.120 --> 00:47:32.960
 - It was.

00:47:32.960 --> 00:47:34.080
 - Yeah, Anna, you've clasped at this one.

00:47:34.080 --> 00:47:34.920
 This is it.

00:47:34.920 --> 00:47:35.760
 (laughing)

00:47:35.760 --> 00:47:37.080
 - Should I?

00:47:37.080 --> 00:47:39.080
 If you were really, really small

00:47:39.080 --> 00:47:41.120
 and you were sitting on a chameleon's tongue

00:47:41.120 --> 00:47:43.440
 and it stuck it out, then you would definitely die.

00:47:43.440 --> 00:47:45.880
 The acceleration of their tongues are amazing.

00:47:45.880 --> 00:47:47.760
 They're actually the highest acceleration

00:47:47.760 --> 00:47:50.560
 and power output, like amount of power generated

00:47:50.560 --> 00:47:53.240
 for any movement of a reptile, bird, or mammal.

00:47:53.240 --> 00:47:54.280
 - It is the same.

00:47:54.280 --> 00:47:55.120
 - Yeah.

00:47:55.120 --> 00:47:58.120
 - The power output is 14,000 watts per kilogram.

00:47:58.120 --> 00:47:58.960
 - Incredible.

00:47:58.960 --> 00:48:02.200
 - Okay, now, Jonas Fingard or Tade Pagaccia

00:48:02.200 --> 00:48:05.240
 who are the best cyclists in the world in the Tour de France

00:48:05.240 --> 00:48:07.520
 say if they're going up a mountain,

00:48:07.520 --> 00:48:11.000
 they can max out at about seven watts per kilogram

00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:14.480
 and these guys are doing 14,000 watts per kilogram.

00:48:14.480 --> 00:48:15.800
 - It's a lot.

00:48:15.800 --> 00:48:17.160
 - I almost can't compute that.

00:48:17.160 --> 00:48:18.000
 That's amazing.

00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:21.400
 - It's like, so the G-force is, I think,

00:48:21.400 --> 00:48:22.880
 the maximum G-force we can survive

00:48:22.880 --> 00:48:25.520
 is maybe nine or 10 for a few seconds by the pilots

00:48:25.520 --> 00:48:28.280
 and the G-force on their tongue would be 264 G.

00:48:28.280 --> 00:48:29.120
 - Okay.

00:48:29.120 --> 00:48:30.920
 (laughing)

00:48:30.920 --> 00:48:32.920
 - Your face is being distorted by that.

00:48:32.920 --> 00:48:34.800
 - That is so cool.

00:48:34.800 --> 00:48:37.720
 I did read a bit about what's inside their tongue

00:48:37.720 --> 00:48:38.760
 'cause they have these things called

00:48:38.760 --> 00:48:41.000
 intralingual sheaths, right?

00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:43.400
 So the tongue has bones running along the core of it,

00:48:43.400 --> 00:48:44.480
 which is weird in itself.

00:48:44.480 --> 00:48:46.320
 I guess they don't, not very big bones,

00:48:46.320 --> 00:48:48.880
 but those are covered by these intralingual sheaths

00:48:48.880 --> 00:48:51.640
 and those are covered by an accelerator muscle

00:48:51.640 --> 00:48:52.800
 and what the chameleon does is

00:48:52.800 --> 00:48:54.720
 the chameleon spring loads the sheaths

00:48:54.720 --> 00:48:57.080
 and packs them into each other like a telescope.

00:48:57.080 --> 00:48:58.640
 - That's like, there was a toy that used to do that

00:48:58.640 --> 00:49:00.120
 that you flicked it when you were younger

00:49:00.120 --> 00:49:03.320
 and it was telescopic and they expanded out, wasn't there?

00:49:03.320 --> 00:49:04.320
 I've got a real memory of that.

00:49:04.320 --> 00:49:05.160
 - I don't remember that.

00:49:05.160 --> 00:49:07.040
 - I was just playing with the chameleon's tongue

00:49:07.040 --> 00:49:07.880
 when I was younger.

00:49:07.880 --> 00:49:10.240
 - You would get like those pointers that teachers had

00:49:10.240 --> 00:49:11.560
 and they would go like that, wouldn't they?

00:49:11.560 --> 00:49:12.400
 - Yes.

00:49:12.400 --> 00:49:14.120
 - I got one of those last year.

00:49:14.120 --> 00:49:14.960
 - For Christmas.

00:49:14.960 --> 00:49:17.920
 - I got one myself at a non-holiday time

00:49:17.920 --> 00:49:19.520
 and God, they're good.

00:49:19.520 --> 00:49:20.360
 - Yeah.

00:49:20.360 --> 00:49:21.200
 - The pointers.

00:49:21.200 --> 00:49:23.760
 - Do you just point at stuff?

00:49:23.760 --> 00:49:24.600
 - Yeah.

00:49:24.600 --> 00:49:26.680
 - Just walk down the street going, there's a fancy tree.

00:49:26.680 --> 00:49:30.120
 - It really, it gives you a kind of authority

00:49:30.120 --> 00:49:33.080
 that is extraordinary, you know.

00:49:33.080 --> 00:49:34.560
 - You've never dared use it here.

00:49:34.560 --> 00:49:36.520
 - No, no, no, but if I'm in the supermarket

00:49:36.520 --> 00:49:38.640
 and I want to put it something on the conveyor belt

00:49:38.640 --> 00:49:42.000
 and say, make sure you apply the discount on that radish,

00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:42.840
 my good man.

00:49:42.840 --> 00:49:44.840
 - I'm gonna bleep this one next.

00:49:44.840 --> 00:49:48.840
 - I'm so confused about why you asked people what it is.

00:49:48.840 --> 00:49:52.400
 - I'm so confused because all of this sounds so plausible.

00:49:52.400 --> 00:49:53.240
 - Yeah.

00:49:53.240 --> 00:49:54.080
 - We're just missing the one detail.

00:49:54.080 --> 00:49:57.440
 - We're sort of playing what I like you now, aren't we?

00:49:57.440 --> 00:49:59.200
 No, I think it was a couple of years ago.

00:49:59.200 --> 00:50:00.520
 I bought it for a show.

00:50:00.520 --> 00:50:02.120
 But I cannot remember the context in which I have

00:50:02.120 --> 00:50:03.160
 and I've just ended up with a pointer,

00:50:03.160 --> 00:50:04.560
 which I'd love to get out occasionally.

00:50:04.560 --> 00:50:05.640
 - That's right.

00:50:05.640 --> 00:50:07.320
 - So chameleon saliva.

00:50:07.320 --> 00:50:09.200
 This was another fact in the inbox actually.

00:50:09.200 --> 00:50:11.120
 So not only did Kate Wood send the original fact,

00:50:11.120 --> 00:50:12.920
 that Robert Harding writes,

00:50:12.920 --> 00:50:15.080
 chameleon saliva is the opposite of custard.

00:50:15.080 --> 00:50:18.800
 - It's disgusting on treacle time.

00:50:18.800 --> 00:50:22.480
 Is that 'cause it's non-Newtonian, but in a different way?

00:50:22.480 --> 00:50:23.600
 - Bingo.

00:50:23.600 --> 00:50:24.440
 - Yes.

00:50:24.440 --> 00:50:26.880
 - So custard, if you run across custard,

00:50:26.880 --> 00:50:29.640
 as you apply force to it, it gets harder.

00:50:29.640 --> 00:50:30.720
 - Very good.

00:50:30.720 --> 00:50:33.000
 That's it, it thickens on impact.

00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:36.080
 A chameleon saliva is thick in the mouth,

00:50:36.080 --> 00:50:38.440
 but when the tongue strikes the insect

00:50:38.440 --> 00:50:40.040
 it's trying to eat or whatever,

00:50:40.040 --> 00:50:43.360
 that blob becomes very malleable for an instant.

00:50:43.360 --> 00:50:44.200
 - That's clever.

00:50:44.200 --> 00:50:45.360
 - And then hardens right again.

00:50:45.360 --> 00:50:46.200
 - Right.

00:50:46.200 --> 00:50:48.360
 - So the prey is then glued to the tongue

00:50:48.360 --> 00:50:51.520
 and then it gets pulled right back into the chameleon's mouth.

00:50:51.520 --> 00:50:52.360
 - That's clever.

00:50:52.360 --> 00:50:53.200
 - Isn't that amazing?

00:50:53.200 --> 00:50:54.920
 - I found a chameleon who was a chameleon

00:50:54.920 --> 00:50:56.680
 before chameleons were chameleons.

00:50:56.680 --> 00:50:57.520
 - What?

00:50:57.520 --> 00:50:58.360
 - Keep talking.

00:50:58.360 --> 00:50:59.200
 - Keep talking.

00:50:59.200 --> 00:51:00.040
 - I got a headache.

00:51:00.040 --> 00:51:02.520
 You know I got a headache and this is not helping.

00:51:02.520 --> 00:51:04.600
 - There used to be a philosopher called chameleon.

00:51:04.600 --> 00:51:05.440
 - Really?

00:51:05.440 --> 00:51:06.680
 - He was a disciple of Aristotle.

00:51:06.680 --> 00:51:09.240
 - Was he the guy who came up with the idea of karma?

00:51:10.240 --> 00:51:13.000
 (laughing)

00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:15.000
 - He, we don't know anything about him.

00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:16.320
 - He's just gonna go straight up.

00:51:16.320 --> 00:51:18.760
 - I'm just, you're ill, you don't know what you're saying.

00:51:18.760 --> 00:51:22.240
 It's just helping you out here.

00:51:22.240 --> 00:51:24.120
 Yeah, no, he is a disciple.

00:51:24.120 --> 00:51:25.600
 We know virtually nothing about him,

00:51:25.600 --> 00:51:27.440
 I guess with us, as with a lot of people then,

00:51:27.440 --> 00:51:29.080
 but he did write a lot of pieces

00:51:29.080 --> 00:51:31.040
 that we do know of his names attached to,

00:51:31.040 --> 00:51:33.360
 like a piece called "On Drunkenness",

00:51:33.360 --> 00:51:35.320
 a piece called "On Pleasure",

00:51:35.320 --> 00:51:36.520
 but virtually nothing is known.

00:51:36.520 --> 00:51:41.360
 But so he lived, he would have died in 281 BC

00:51:41.360 --> 00:51:43.560
 and the word chameleon came about

00:51:43.560 --> 00:51:46.560
 in roughly the 14th century, mid-14th century.

00:51:46.560 --> 00:51:48.080
 - Okay, interesting.

00:51:48.080 --> 00:51:49.200
 - To describe the lizard, presumably.

00:51:49.200 --> 00:51:50.920
 - To describe the lizard and what's interesting is,

00:51:50.920 --> 00:51:52.720
 Aristotle wrote about chameleons,

00:51:52.720 --> 00:51:53.960
 but we just didn't have the word

00:51:53.960 --> 00:51:55.400
 and he wasn't writing about his mate.

00:51:55.400 --> 00:51:56.440
 - So did he always have to say,

00:51:56.440 --> 00:51:58.600
 "You know that thing that kind of changes color,

00:51:58.600 --> 00:52:00.440
 "looks a bit like a gecko?"

00:52:00.440 --> 00:52:03.000
 - Looks like my mate, my disciples, yeah.

00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:05.120
 - Can I give you some animals

00:52:05.120 --> 00:52:06.320
 that were thought to be extinct,

00:52:06.320 --> 00:52:07.160
 but then aren't.

00:52:07.160 --> 00:52:08.500
 - Yes.

00:52:08.500 --> 00:52:10.800
 - The Canterbury, Nobdweevil.

00:52:10.800 --> 00:52:11.640
 - Okay.

00:52:11.640 --> 00:52:13.200
 (laughing)

00:52:13.200 --> 00:52:15.240
 - I might just stop there actually.

00:52:15.240 --> 00:52:16.400
 - No, more, more!

00:52:16.400 --> 00:52:18.600
 - The cloaked bee, the dinosaur ant,

00:52:18.600 --> 00:52:21.520
 the terrace skink, the Batman river loach,

00:52:21.520 --> 00:52:24.160
 the painted frog, and the Machu Picchu,

00:52:24.160 --> 00:52:26.720
 arboreal chinchilla rat,

00:52:26.720 --> 00:52:29.200
 which was found in a tree near Machu Picchu.

00:52:29.200 --> 00:52:30.040
 - Right.

00:52:30.040 --> 00:52:31.600
 - When they un-extincted it.

00:52:31.600 --> 00:52:32.440
 - Wow.

00:52:32.440 --> 00:52:33.800
 - So these are just all things,

00:52:33.800 --> 00:52:36.000
 was there one big find, one day out,

00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:37.320
 where they're just all hanging out

00:52:37.320 --> 00:52:40.040
 in the same playing cards for a while?

00:52:40.040 --> 00:52:41.880
 - It's some sort of like support group

00:52:41.880 --> 00:52:45.080
 for the extinct who aren't extinct, yeah.

00:52:45.080 --> 00:52:47.560
 - There's also the Confusing Rocket Frog.

00:52:47.560 --> 00:52:48.760
 - That's a great name.

00:52:48.760 --> 00:52:51.440
 - And they found it in 2019,

00:52:51.440 --> 00:52:53.440
 and it's called Confusing because it looks a lot

00:52:53.440 --> 00:52:56.160
 like other frogs, but it's the Confusing Rocket Frog.

00:52:56.160 --> 00:52:57.640
 And the interesting thing about this is,

00:52:57.640 --> 00:53:00.320
 it was thought to be extinct in 1985.

00:53:00.320 --> 00:53:02.960
 They found it in 2019, but luckily it was in a place

00:53:02.960 --> 00:53:04.960
 where they were about to do loads of mining

00:53:04.960 --> 00:53:06.240
 and logging and stuff like that,

00:53:06.240 --> 00:53:08.040
 and it meant that they couldn't do any of it.

00:53:08.040 --> 00:53:08.880
 - Brilliant.

00:53:08.880 --> 00:53:09.720
 - I think it's in Ecuador.

00:53:09.720 --> 00:53:10.560
 - That's great.

00:53:10.560 --> 00:53:11.560
 - Well done, Little Rocket Frog.

00:53:11.560 --> 00:53:13.120
 - The Painted Frog, was that one that you said?

00:53:13.120 --> 00:53:14.600
 - Painted Frog, yeah.

00:53:14.600 --> 00:53:16.320
 - Which just sounds like someone forcing

00:53:16.320 --> 00:53:18.280
 chameleonism onto animals.

00:53:18.280 --> 00:53:19.920
 (all laughing)

00:53:19.920 --> 00:53:20.920
 - That's very interesting.

00:53:20.920 --> 00:53:22.720
 - There's a type of fish that was thought

00:53:22.720 --> 00:53:25.160
 to have gone extinct 66 million years ago,

00:53:25.160 --> 00:53:27.920
 and then it was found in 1938.

00:53:27.920 --> 00:53:29.200
 And it's the Sealocanth.

00:53:29.200 --> 00:53:32.360
 And do you know the story of how it was rediscovered?

00:53:32.360 --> 00:53:33.200
 - Is it?

00:53:33.200 --> 00:53:34.040
 - It's so cool.

00:53:34.040 --> 00:53:34.880
 - Was it in 1938?

00:53:34.880 --> 00:53:36.680
 Was it found by a submarine?

00:53:36.680 --> 00:53:40.600
 - No, no, just found by a normal fisherman in South Africa,

00:53:40.600 --> 00:53:42.440
 caught a weird fish, got back,

00:53:42.440 --> 00:53:44.600
 gave it to this woman who ran the museum,

00:53:44.600 --> 00:53:46.120
 who thought that's weird.

00:53:46.120 --> 00:53:47.280
 So she sketched it.

00:53:47.280 --> 00:53:48.120
 - Oh, I remember, yay.

00:53:48.120 --> 00:53:50.080
 - It's amazing, so she sketched it,

00:53:50.080 --> 00:53:52.080
 and she sent it to Professor Smith,

00:53:52.080 --> 00:53:54.240
 who she knew would be able to tell her what it was.

00:53:54.240 --> 00:53:57.200
 Professor Smith received her sketch, no straight away.

00:53:57.200 --> 00:53:58.040
 This is the Sealocanth.

00:53:58.040 --> 00:54:00.920
 It's been 66 million years, we thought it was gone.

00:54:00.920 --> 00:54:03.160
 And he goes and he visits it,

00:54:03.160 --> 00:54:05.400
 but it's kind of disintegrated by that point.

00:54:05.400 --> 00:54:07.800
 So he can't confirm really that lots about it,

00:54:07.800 --> 00:54:08.760
 or where it came from.

00:54:08.760 --> 00:54:11.240
 And he devoted the next 14 years

00:54:11.240 --> 00:54:14.000
 to finding a second specimen.

00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:15.360
 He was desperate.

00:54:15.360 --> 00:54:18.160
 And eventually there was a guy on the,

00:54:18.160 --> 00:54:21.800
 one of the Comoros Islands off Mozambique in 1952,

00:54:21.800 --> 00:54:22.960
 who found one.

00:54:22.960 --> 00:54:26.200
 And Smith was managed to convince the South African government

00:54:26.200 --> 00:54:28.920
 to get a military plane to fly him

00:54:28.920 --> 00:54:30.840
 to off the coast of Mozambique.

00:54:30.840 --> 00:54:33.080
 He had to have a conversation with the Mozambique authorities,

00:54:33.080 --> 00:54:34.880
 saying, "Hey, we're flying military planes

00:54:34.880 --> 00:54:36.760
 "over your airspace, really sorry."

00:54:36.760 --> 00:54:38.360
 They were like, "Why are you doing that?"

00:54:38.360 --> 00:54:40.200
 They said, "We're just going to pick up a fish."

00:54:40.200 --> 00:54:41.720
 - I remember reading that story,

00:54:41.720 --> 00:54:44.720
 and I think the woman who found it in the first place

00:54:44.720 --> 00:54:46.760
 and knew there was something up,

00:54:46.760 --> 00:54:49.000
 I think it was either Smith or someone else said

00:54:49.000 --> 00:54:51.320
 it was evidence of women's intuition.

00:54:51.320 --> 00:54:53.560
 The greatest evidence we ever had of women's intuition.

00:54:53.560 --> 00:54:54.400
 - Really?

00:54:54.400 --> 00:54:55.760
 Marjorie Courtney Lassmer, really?

00:54:55.760 --> 00:54:57.040
 - That's what I said, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:54:57.040 --> 00:54:58.920
 - What, just 'cause she sensed that this is a weird...

00:54:58.920 --> 00:55:00.480
 - She just knew there was something going on.

00:55:00.480 --> 00:55:02.120
 - Yeah. - Wow.

00:55:02.120 --> 00:55:03.960
 - Just proving two things with one fish,

00:55:03.960 --> 00:55:05.480
 that's pretty cool.

00:55:05.480 --> 00:55:06.560
 Not only do we have the fish,

00:55:06.560 --> 00:55:08.240
 we now know about women's intuition.

00:55:08.240 --> 00:55:09.840
 (all laughing)

00:55:09.840 --> 00:55:11.920
 - Happy day for the world.

00:55:11.920 --> 00:55:15.320
 - I'd love it if his paper, which eventually came out,

00:55:15.320 --> 00:55:17.440
 was about women's intuition, not about the fish.

00:55:17.440 --> 00:55:19.480
 (all laughing)

00:55:19.480 --> 00:55:22.060
 (upbeat music)

00:55:22.060 --> 00:55:25.440
 - Okay, that's it.

00:55:25.440 --> 00:55:26.440
 That is all of our facts.

00:55:26.440 --> 00:55:27.960
 Thank you so much for listening.

00:55:27.960 --> 00:55:29.960
 If you would like to get in contact with any of us

00:55:29.960 --> 00:55:31.000

00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:32.240
 over the course of this podcast,

00:55:32.240 --> 00:55:35.160
 we can all be found on our social media accounts.

00:55:35.160 --> 00:55:38.720
 I'm on Instagram, just use Shriverland.

00:55:38.720 --> 00:55:39.560
 James.

00:55:39.560 --> 00:55:42.720
 - I'm on Twitter, just use @JamesHarken.

00:55:42.720 --> 00:55:43.560

 - I'm on X at @AndrewHunterM.

00:55:45.520 --> 00:55:47.000
 (all laughing)

00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:47.840
 Sorry.

00:55:47.840 --> 00:55:50.720
 - And Anna, how can they get through to us as a group?

00:55:50.720 --> 00:55:54.840
 - You can just use the email address podcast@qi.com

00:55:54.840 --> 00:55:57.800
 or the Twitter handle @NoSuchThing.

00:55:57.800 --> 00:55:58.640
 - That's right.

00:55:58.640 --> 00:55:59.480
 Or you can head to our website,

00:55:59.480 --> 00:56:01.160
 no such thing as a fish.com.

00:56:01.160 --> 00:56:02.840
 All of the previous episodes are up there,

00:56:02.840 --> 00:56:04.400
 so do check them out.

00:56:04.400 --> 00:56:05.840
 Otherwise, come back next week,

00:56:05.840 --> 00:56:07.520
 'cause we'll be here with another episode

00:56:07.520 --> 00:56:08.640
 and we'll see you then.

00:56:08.640 --> 00:56:09.680
 Goodbye.

00:56:09.680 --> 00:56:12.260
 (upbeat music)

00:56:12.260 --> 00:56:14.840
 (upbeat music)

00:56:15.840 --> 00:56:18.420

00:56:18.420 --> 00:56:21.000
