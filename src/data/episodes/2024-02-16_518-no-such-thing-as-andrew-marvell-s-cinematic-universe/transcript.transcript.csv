00:00:00,00:00:02,(upbeat music)
00:00:02,00:00:16,- Hello and welcome to another episode
00:00:16,00:00:19,"of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast"
00:00:19,00:00:22,coming to you from the QI offices in Hoburn.
00:00:22,00:00:23,My name is Dan Shriver.
00:00:23,00:00:25,"I am sitting here with Andrew Hunter Murray,"
00:00:25,00:00:27,James Harkin and Anna Tyshinski.
00:00:27,00:00:29,"And once again, we have gathered around the microphones"
00:00:29,00:00:32,of our four favorite facts from the last seven days.
00:00:32,00:00:35,"And in a particular order, here we go."
00:00:35,00:00:38,"Starting with fact number one, and that is Anna."
00:00:38,00:00:42,- My fact this week is that shortly after writing an essay
00:00:42,00:00:45,"on why writers shouldn't publish anonymously,"
00:00:45,00:00:47,Anthony Trollett published a book anonymously.
00:00:47,00:00:52,"- Oh, it's called out a mere 130 years from later."
00:00:52,00:00:53,(laughing)
00:00:53,00:00:56,- Not a moment too soon.
00:00:56,00:00:58,I've just sort of inherited from a friend
00:00:58,00:01:00,"who decided he was never gonna read them,"
00:01:00,00:01:01,the complete works of Anthony Trollett.
00:01:01,00:01:04,And he's giving them to me in bits
00:01:04,00:01:04,and he seems to have given me
00:01:04,00:01:06,the three least known Anthony Trollett.
00:01:06,00:01:11,"So this is an introduction to Nina Bellatka, which was..."
00:01:11,00:01:13,"- If you wanna get into Trollett,"
00:01:13,00:01:15,I would say probably don't start with that one.
00:01:15,00:01:18,"- It's not an entry level, no, no."
00:01:18,00:01:21,"Anyway, this fact, Nina Bellatka in the introduction,"
00:01:21,00:01:24,it just mentioned that he wrote an essay in 1865
00:01:24,00:01:28,and he said a man should always dare to be responsible
00:01:28,00:01:29,for the work which he does
00:01:29,00:01:32,"and should be ready to accept the shame, rebuffs, ridicule,"
00:01:32,00:01:34,or the indifference which will attend bad work.
00:01:34,00:01:36,"And it's all about how, you know,"
00:01:36,00:01:37,put your name to something
00:01:37,00:01:41,and then he didn't put his name to Nina Bellatka and...
00:01:41,00:01:43,"- I do have some sympathy, but if your name is A Trollop"
00:01:43,00:01:45,that you don't wanna put it on every big video.
00:01:45,00:01:47,(laughing)
00:01:47,00:01:48,- Who here has read Trollop?
00:01:48,00:01:50,- I've read the start of Barchester Towers.
00:01:50,00:01:51,- Okay.
00:01:51,00:01:52,- Did you read it in preparation for this book?
00:01:52,00:01:55,- I certainly did. (laughing)
00:01:55,00:01:56,- Read the first 50 pages.
00:01:56,00:01:57,- Nice.
00:01:57,00:01:59,- Like I've done quite a lot of books over the years
00:01:59,00:02:00,just because of this podcast.
00:02:00,00:02:01,- Yeah.
00:02:01,00:02:03,"- Just kind of started reading, got an idea and gone,"
00:02:03,00:02:04,"well, I think I've got an idea"
00:02:04,00:02:06,of this guy's entire earth right now.
00:02:06,00:02:07,- How have you got to the end?
00:02:07,00:02:08,You don't know about the robots in it.
00:02:08,00:02:10,- What?
00:02:10,00:02:12,"So Anna's read some Trollop, Andy, you must have done."
00:02:12,00:02:14,- I'm actually a Trollop virgin.
00:02:14,00:02:16,"- Honestly, I said to my wife last night"
00:02:16,00:02:19,"that if anyone likes Anthony Trollop,"
00:02:19,00:02:20,Andy would like Anthony Trollop.
00:02:20,00:02:24,- Is it because he writes about ecclesiastical
00:02:24,00:02:26,matters in the 19th century?
00:02:26,00:02:26,- Yeah.
00:02:26,00:02:27,- Yeah.
00:02:27,00:02:28,- I think I will.
00:02:28,00:02:29,- It's right up your street.
00:02:29,00:02:30,- I don't know if it is.
00:02:30,00:02:31,I think that's a missed call on Andy.
00:02:31,00:02:32,- You think?
00:02:32,00:02:32,"- Yeah, I do."
00:02:32,00:02:35,I think I slightly prefer that kind of literature.
00:02:35,00:02:37,- It feels like it's in between what you would like.
00:02:37,00:02:40,It feels to me like it's halfway between Dickens
00:02:40,00:02:41,and Jane Austen.
00:02:41,00:02:43,"- It is, but the thing about Anthony Trollop,"
00:02:43,00:02:46,he's not as widely read as I think he should be.
00:02:46,00:02:48,He's frowned on in a lot of circles
00:02:48,00:02:49,because he was just a machine.
00:02:49,00:02:50,- Yeah.
00:02:50,00:02:52,"- Of output, wasn't he?"
00:02:52,00:02:54,"47 novels, loads of stories."
00:02:54,00:02:56,"His routine was getting up every morning,"
00:02:56,00:02:59,"5.30, writing for three solid hours."
00:02:59,00:03:01,"He put a watch in front of him,"
00:03:01,00:03:04,"made himself write 250 words every 15 minutes,"
00:03:04,00:03:05,and he didn't have word counts that time.
00:03:05,00:03:08,So he must have incorporated counting the words.
00:03:08,00:03:09,- He must have counted the pages
00:03:09,00:03:11,'cause he just had so much stuff.
00:03:11,00:03:12,- I love it.
00:03:12,00:03:13,I think that's exactly how I would write
00:03:13,00:03:15,if I was writing novels.
00:03:15,00:03:17,"- I actually thought reading about him,"
00:03:17,00:03:18,and this is not a negative thing at all.
00:03:18,00:03:21,I thought there's quite a lot of you in him.
00:03:21,00:03:22,- He's quite annoying.
00:03:22,00:03:24,We all write books.
00:03:24,00:03:27,"As someone who, you know, footles around a bit,"
00:03:27,00:03:29,toys with the margins.
00:03:29,00:03:30,"As you know, and you just see,"
00:03:30,00:03:33,"in the time you've spent footling around with the margins,"
00:03:33,00:03:37,Anthony Trollop will have written 16 pages in prose.
00:03:37,00:03:38,He had a portable desk made.
00:03:38,00:03:39,I love this.
00:03:39,00:03:40,So he could write on trains.
00:03:40,00:03:42,"And if he was going on board a ship,"
00:03:42,00:03:44,he would meet up with the ship's carpenter
00:03:44,00:03:46,to arrange proper writing conditions.
00:03:46,00:03:49,- That's pretty ritzy.
00:03:49,00:03:49,- Wow.
00:03:49,00:03:50,- That's cool.
00:03:50,00:03:52,"- But the reason he had to do it was 'cause he was,"
00:03:52,00:03:54,"and I'm simplifying here, postman."
00:03:54,00:03:55,(all laughing)
00:03:55,00:03:57,You are simplifying.
00:03:57,00:03:58,But he wrote in the morning
00:03:58,00:03:59,'cause he had a full-time job at the post office
00:03:59,00:04:00,"for about, what, how long was this?"
00:04:00,00:04:01,Decades.
00:04:01,00:04:02,- Yeah.
00:04:02,00:04:03,- And he was quite 60s.
00:04:03,00:04:04,- He was really senior.
00:04:04,00:04:05,He was really senior in the post office.
00:04:05,00:04:06,"- Yeah, what if you worked there that long?"
00:04:06,00:04:07,"- And it's that really cool fact,"
00:04:07,00:04:09,"which is the only thing I knew about him,"
00:04:09,00:04:11,which is that he's basically responsible
00:04:11,00:04:14,for the reason that we have post boxes all over the UK.
00:04:14,00:04:15,Possibly he's spotted in in France.
00:04:15,00:04:17,"I don't think he ever claimed that he invented it,"
00:04:17,00:04:19,but he certainly recommended it to the government.
00:04:19,00:04:21,"And they used to be green, but now they're red."
00:04:21,00:04:22,- That's the thing though.
00:04:22,00:04:25,"Like he is responsible for that, I suppose,"
00:04:25,00:04:26,but they did exist in France.
00:04:26,00:04:28,They did exist in Belgium.
00:04:28,00:04:31,The stamp had been invented about 30 or 40 years earlier.
00:04:31,00:04:33,"It feels like we might have got there anyway,"
00:04:33,00:04:34,even without him.
00:04:34,00:04:37,"- Maybe totally, but he's the one who did, yeah."
00:04:37,00:04:40,"Hey, here's a cool quote just to sort of really hammer home"
00:04:40,00:04:41,what a workaholic he was.
00:04:41,00:04:44,"He said, ""There is no human bliss equal to 12 hours of work"
00:04:44,00:04:47,"""with only six hours in which to do it."""
00:04:47,00:04:50,- He was a bit like bankers in 1990s in the UK
00:04:50,00:04:53,"because his motto was, ""No day without a line."""
00:04:53,00:04:54,- Hey.
00:04:54,00:05:00,Can we talk a little about Fanny Trollop?
00:05:00,00:05:01,- Sure. - Yeah.
00:05:01,00:05:02,- His mum. - Yeah.
00:05:02,00:05:03,"- Yes, please."
00:05:03,00:05:05,- So his parents were very interesting people.
00:05:05,00:05:09,"Just briefly, his dad was a complete failure in life."
00:05:09,00:05:10,"Sounds harsh, but it is true."
00:05:10,00:05:11,- It must have been someone in a podcast
00:05:11,00:05:13,in 200 years saying that about you.
00:05:13,00:05:14,"- I know, I know, and they will."
00:05:14,00:05:17,"I hope they will, I dream of them doing that, you know."
00:05:17,00:05:19,But his father had law work which had failed
00:05:19,00:05:20,and a farm which had failed.
00:05:20,00:05:22,"And he decided finally to write, I think,"
00:05:22,00:05:24,"called the Encyclopedia Ecclesiastica,"
00:05:24,00:05:27,which would define all the ecclesiastical terms
00:05:27,00:05:28,that had ever existed.
00:05:28,00:05:29,"And by the time he died,"
00:05:29,00:05:31,he was still only on the letter D.
00:05:31,00:05:35,"- Ah, to be honest, church is quite a long one."
00:05:35,00:05:38,"- Oh, huge, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:05:38,00:05:39,"- Yeah, it was R-Men."
00:05:39,00:05:41,There's another biggy guy on the top.
00:05:41,00:05:42,Chassable.
00:05:42,00:05:43,"- I mean, you can see why he-- - Chassel."
00:05:43,00:05:44,"- You can see why he struggled, you know."
00:05:44,00:05:46,"- Christian, Catholic."
00:05:46,00:05:48,"- Oh, baby Jesus, starting with David."
00:05:48,00:05:49,(both laughing)
00:05:49,00:05:50,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:05:50,00:05:54,"- Anyway, that was his dad, tricky time."
00:05:54,00:05:58,But his mum was a successful author and mega successful.
00:05:58,00:06:00,And she made her name by writing a book
00:06:00,00:06:02,called The Domestic Manners of the Americans.
00:06:02,00:06:04,"'Cause she'd gone to America, set up this business venture"
00:06:04,00:06:07,which had completely collapsed and been a disaster.
00:06:07,00:06:08,"And, but then she wrote this book,"
00:06:08,00:06:11,which was basically just incredibly rude
00:06:11,00:06:13,about everyone in the USA.
00:06:13,00:06:15,"It was very, very, very snobbish."
00:06:15,00:06:17,And it became a massive success.
00:06:17,00:06:19,"- She said of people living in New York,"
00:06:19,00:06:21,"that they were bullying, struggling, crafty,"
00:06:21,00:06:23,"enterprising, industrious, swaggering,"
00:06:23,00:06:26,"drinking, boasting, and money-getting."
00:06:26,00:06:28,"But then enemy of the podcast, Mark Twain."
00:06:28,00:06:29,- Thank you.
00:06:29,00:06:30,(both laughing)
00:06:30,00:06:33,"- He really loved her and he was like basically saying,"
00:06:33,00:06:34,"well, you know, she's telling the truth."
00:06:34,00:06:37,"That's what we're like, fair enough, fair play."
00:06:37,00:06:40,"- So he liked her, so I now don't like her."
00:06:40,00:06:41,"Great, okay, thank you."
00:06:41,00:06:43,I'm sort of keeping my beef going throughout the century.
00:06:43,00:06:46,- One thing I noticed from reading the first 50 pages
00:06:46,00:06:51,by Chester Towers is how hackish he is with names.
00:06:51,00:06:52,"- Oh, really?"
00:06:52,00:06:54,- I don't know if you notice the same with the ones
00:06:54,00:06:55,that you've read before.
00:06:55,00:06:56,- I've only read the way we live now.
00:06:56,00:06:58,"- Well, like the first two,"
00:06:58,00:07:00,"a couple of the first characters are,"
00:07:00,00:07:02,I think the policemen and they're called
00:07:02,00:07:05,"Landon Mew New and Omicron Pie,"
00:07:05,00:07:07,where he's basically just taken Greek letters
00:07:07,00:07:09,and turned them into names.
00:07:09,00:07:10,- Right.
00:07:10,00:07:12,- So what he used to do quite a lot is do that thing
00:07:12,00:07:14,"where, I suppose Dickens did it a bit,"
00:07:14,00:07:17,where you just take whatever attribute your character has
00:07:17,00:07:19,and just call them that.
00:07:19,00:07:20,"- Oh yeah, Dickens is, yeah."
00:07:20,00:07:21,"- Right, yeah."
00:07:21,00:07:24,"- So in his novel, Miss Mackenzie,"
00:07:24,00:07:26,it's about a young woman who's pursued by three men
00:07:26,00:07:29,"who are called Handcock, Rub and Ball."
00:07:29,00:07:30,- What?
00:07:30,00:07:32,(both laughing)
00:07:32,00:07:33,- And there was another man.
00:07:33,00:07:34,- Handcock?
00:07:34,00:07:34,- Handcock?
00:07:34,00:07:36,(both laughing)
00:07:36,00:07:39,- And there's another man in it where he's not a suitable
00:07:39,00:07:42,"suitor for this woman, and he's called Mr. Frigidae."
00:07:42,00:07:43,- Wow.
00:07:43,00:07:45,"- I mean, they're so on the note."
00:07:45,00:07:47,"- It takes a bit of the suspense out of it, doesn't it?"
00:07:47,00:07:49,"- Yeah, I think so."
00:07:49,00:07:51,I wonder if I can give you some names of characters
00:07:51,00:07:54,and you can tell me what they did in the novel.
00:07:54,00:07:56,"- Oh, okay, yeah, great."
00:07:56,00:07:58,- So Dick Rabbit.
00:07:58,00:08:01,- Ended up in prison.
00:08:01,00:08:03,"- So, Shaggy Rabbit, obviously, yeah."
00:08:03,00:08:05,"Had lots of kids, breed it a lot."
00:08:05,00:08:06,- Nice.
00:08:06,00:08:07,"- No, he was the leader of a hunt."
00:08:07,00:08:08,- Okay.
00:08:08,00:08:09,"- Yeah, good."
00:08:09,00:08:10,- Samuel Nickham.
00:08:10,00:08:11,- Policeman?
00:08:11,00:08:12,"- Police, yeah, yeah."
00:08:12,00:08:13,- Kind of.
00:08:13,00:08:15,"He wasn't a policeman, but he found evidence against"
00:08:15,00:08:17,some people who've been poisoning animals.
00:08:17,00:08:18,"- I was going to say shoplifter,"
00:08:18,00:08:19,and I've only just realized that nicking him
00:08:19,00:08:23,"is something that shoplifters do, and policemen do."
00:08:23,00:08:24,I nick him.
00:08:24,00:08:25,"No, I nick him."
00:08:25,00:08:26,We're on opposite sides.
00:08:26,00:08:27,How confusing.
00:08:27,00:08:28,"- Gosh, yeah, food for thought."
00:08:28,00:08:32,"- So, Oliver Crumblewit."
00:08:32,00:08:34,"- Stand up, stand up comedian."
00:08:34,00:08:34,- Yeah.
00:08:34,00:08:36,- Someone who thinks they're funny.
00:08:36,00:08:38,"So, like, this is on a dad joke"
00:08:38,00:08:41,to call back to the previous episode character.
00:08:41,00:08:43,"- No, he was a phrenologist."
00:08:43,00:08:44,- Crumble.
00:08:44,00:08:46,"- So, just like, witless person,"
00:08:46,00:08:48,I guess he was slugging off phrenology.
00:08:48,00:08:50,And Joe Thurabug.
00:08:50,00:08:51,- Thurabug.
00:08:51,00:08:53,(all laughing)
00:08:53,00:08:54,- Proctologist.
00:08:54,00:08:57,(all laughing)
00:08:57,00:08:59,"- No, he was a brewer, of course."
00:08:59,00:09:00,"- Oh, very nice."
00:09:00,00:09:01,"- Brewer, I was going to say the bunghole in the sherry."
00:09:01,00:09:02,That's right.
00:09:02,00:09:04,"Did you, sorry, just while we're quickly"
00:09:04,00:09:06,"on Barchester Towers, have you ever got to a bit"
00:09:06,00:09:09,in the book where he injects himself as a narrator?
00:09:09,00:09:11,Because that's something he apparently loves to do.
00:09:11,00:09:12,"So, he does it twice."
00:09:12,00:09:13,- He pops in.
00:09:13,00:09:14,- He pops in.
00:09:14,00:09:15,"So, for example, there's a sentence"
00:09:15,00:09:16,"that comes in that book where it says,"
00:09:16,00:09:18,"""How easily she would have forgiven"
00:09:18,00:09:20,"""and forgotten the Archdeacon's suspicions"
00:09:20,00:09:23,"""had she heard the whole truth from Mr. Arobin,"
00:09:23,00:09:25,"""but then where would have been my novel?"""
00:09:25,00:09:28,"- Oh, I didn't notice that, I love it."
00:09:28,00:09:30,"- And then right at the end, he says,"
00:09:30,00:09:32,"""The end of a novel, like the end of a children's"
00:09:32,00:09:34,"""dinner party must be filled with sweet meats"
00:09:34,00:09:37,"""and sugar plums, obviously alluding maybe"
00:09:37,00:09:39,"""to a nice happy ending."""
00:09:39,00:09:43,"- Yes, followed by tears, someone being sick,"
00:09:43,00:09:44,"people being dragged home, screaming."
00:09:44,00:09:45,- Nits being spread.
00:09:45,00:09:49,"- Yeah, he does do that self-consciously a little bit."
00:09:49,00:09:50,"Yeah, sometimes we'll be like,"
00:09:50,00:09:52,"""She's my favorite, actually, she's lovely."""
00:09:52,00:09:53,- I think that's good.
00:09:53,00:09:54,"I mean, Jane Austen does that all the time,"
00:09:54,00:09:55,just sort of pops her head around the curtain
00:09:55,00:09:57,"and says, ""Hello,"" and then pops back."
00:09:57,00:09:58,I like it.
00:09:58,00:10:00,"Have you heard of his novel, The Fixed Period?"
00:10:00,00:10:01,This is very weird.
00:10:01,00:10:05,"So this was his, I think, only venture into sci-fi"
00:10:05,00:10:09,where it's set in 1980 on a fictional island
00:10:09,00:10:12,in the southern hemisphere called Britannula.
00:10:12,00:10:14,And the main point of the story is that it has
00:10:14,00:10:15,compulsory euthanasia for anyone
00:10:15,00:10:18,"between the age of 67 and 68, that's the idea."
00:10:18,00:10:21,It also features a futuristic cricket match.
00:10:21,00:10:23,"- Bit harsh, you can't get to the best age."
00:10:23,00:10:26,"- Right, yeah, yeah."
00:10:26,00:10:27,- Maybe he was sick of all the innuendo.
00:10:27,00:10:30,"- Right, there's a steam tricycle"
00:10:30,00:10:32,which can go at 25 miles an hour.
00:10:32,00:10:34,So it's still rooted in the 19th century.
00:10:34,00:10:38,"But, get this, Trollope died at the age of 67 and a half."
00:10:38,00:10:39,- Did he?
00:10:39,00:10:43,"- Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun."
00:10:43,00:10:45,"He didn't do much on the sci-fi,"
00:10:45,00:10:47,"but basically, I think his novels were essentially"
00:10:47,00:10:48,a Marvel marvel.
00:10:48,00:10:49,- Marvel?
00:10:49,00:10:50,"- Marvel, sorry."
00:10:50,00:10:51,- Andrew Marvel.
00:10:51,00:10:53,- An Andrew Marvel universe.
00:10:53,00:10:54,- 17th century Laureate.
00:10:54,00:10:55,- Yeah.
00:10:55,00:10:56,- Yes.
00:10:56,00:10:56,(laughing)
00:10:56,00:10:57,- That's so funny.
00:10:57,00:10:59,"- It's how they, but world enough and time,"
00:10:59,00:11:00,"they would, is that him?"
00:11:00,00:11:01,"- Yeah, very good."
00:11:01,00:11:03,- And then they would have written a Marvel comic
00:11:03,00:11:04,because he basically did that.
00:11:04,00:11:06,He created a universe.
00:11:06,00:11:08,"- Ah, right, oh, lovely, yeah, yeah."
00:11:08,00:11:09,- And I think this kind of explains why he was able
00:11:09,00:11:11,"to churn things out so much,"
00:11:11,00:11:12,"as well as the fact that when you read them,"
00:11:12,00:11:13,there are a lot of extra words.
00:11:13,00:11:16,"But like the passage of chronicles,"
00:11:16,00:11:18,"oh well, you can lose a lot."
00:11:18,00:11:20,"- Have you ever read, sorry to, this is a digression,"
00:11:20,00:11:22,but have you ever read the Wumble books?
00:11:22,00:11:23,- No.
00:11:23,00:11:25,- I was reading the Wumble books to my daughter
00:11:25,00:11:27,"and all the way through, it's like,"
00:11:27,00:11:29,and then the Wumble went to the park
00:11:29,00:11:30,and picked up some litter.
00:11:30,00:11:33,"They picked up an umbrella, a bag of crisps,"
00:11:33,00:11:37,"like this, and they just fill up all the sentences"
00:11:37,00:11:38,with just lists of nonsense.
00:11:38,00:11:40,- That's your word count for the day.
00:11:40,00:11:41,"That's Trollup thinking, right,"
00:11:41,00:11:44,I put in 16 adjectives to describe this table.
00:11:44,00:11:46,"That's fine, I can knock off for the next five minutes."
00:11:46,00:11:47,- Can't believe you're reading the Wumble books.
00:11:47,00:11:49,'Cause I thought it was just a TV show.
00:11:49,00:11:50,"You're the guy who's like, you know,"
00:11:50,00:11:51,the books are actually--
00:11:51,00:11:52,- The novelizations of the Wumbles
00:11:52,00:11:55,"are actually really, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:11:55,00:11:56,- I think the books came before the TV show.
00:11:56,00:11:58,"- Oh, sure they did, yeah."
00:11:59,00:12:00,- Anyway.
00:12:00,00:12:01,- So it's the Trollup Cinematic Universe.
00:12:01,00:12:04,"- The Cinematic Universe, so it embosses shit."
00:12:04,00:12:06,"It's really fun, so I've only read one"
00:12:06,00:12:08,"and actually it's The Way We Live Now, which isn't the universe,"
00:12:08,00:12:10,but my husband happens to have read quite a few more
00:12:10,00:12:12,and he says it's fun 'cause characters pop in
00:12:12,00:12:13,from other places.
00:12:13,00:12:15,"- Lovely, I love it, I love it, I love it a lot."
00:12:15,00:12:18,- So that Vick who was quite annoying when he was 25
00:12:18,00:12:20,is now 40 and he's a bit wiser.
00:12:20,00:12:23,- I reckon that he had hyper-fantasia.
00:12:23,00:12:23,- Oh yeah.
00:12:23,00:12:25,"- Which is, so I have a fantasia,"
00:12:25,00:12:27,"which means I can't imagine things,"
00:12:27,00:12:29,but some people have hyper-fantasia
00:12:29,00:12:30,where you really can't imagine anything.
00:12:30,00:12:33,It's like just an incredible story going on in your head
00:12:33,00:12:35,and sometimes you don't even realize that it's in your head.
00:12:35,00:12:39,And he used to say that his main work that he did was
00:12:39,00:12:41,when he was daydreaming.
00:12:41,00:12:43,"So, you know, he would churn out these words,"
00:12:43,00:12:45,"but actually the rest of the day he'd just be thinking,"
00:12:45,00:12:47,"""Oh, I wonder what my characters would be doing now."""
00:12:47,00:12:49,"When he came to write them down, it was pretty easy for him"
00:12:49,00:12:52,"'cause it was just, this is what I remember them doing."
00:12:52,00:12:53,- I think he almost says that the plot
00:12:53,00:12:55,is kind of not even really important.
00:12:55,00:12:59,"It's just, it's about the characters exactly, as you say."
00:12:59,00:13:01,- I want to know what his legs were like
00:13:01,00:13:03,'cause I think he might have had a fantastic pair of legs.
00:13:03,00:13:04,"- Okay, go on."
00:13:04,00:13:08,"- Well, he was all over the UK"
00:13:08,00:13:09,for his work for the post office.
00:13:09,00:13:11,"It was sent to Ireland, first of all,"
00:13:11,00:13:12,which is where he started writing.
00:13:12,00:13:15,And basically he had to work out the routes for postmen
00:13:15,00:13:16,and he rode across the countryside.
00:13:16,00:13:19,He did about 40 miles a day riding across the countryside.
00:13:19,00:13:21,- It feels like the horse would have a good leg.
00:13:21,00:13:21,"- No, you're right, sorry."
00:13:21,00:13:23,He'd have a great bum.
00:13:23,00:13:26,"But he was a member of a thing called the Tramp Society,"
00:13:26,00:13:27,which was a ramblers club across Southeast England.
00:13:27,00:13:30,They just walked huge distances every time they let up.
00:13:30,00:13:32,"Yeah, so I think, I think his lower half"
00:13:32,00:13:34,might have been incredibly fit.
00:13:34,00:13:36,"- Well, in support, I think of that."
00:13:36,00:13:37,Do you know what the hardest day's work
00:13:37,00:13:38,he ever did in his life was?
00:13:38,00:13:39,And that's a high bar for Truller.
00:13:39,00:13:40,"- Oh, no."
00:13:40,00:13:42,- It was walking.
00:13:42,00:13:45,And it was when he was posted to Glasgow
00:13:45,00:13:48,"and he wanted to review postman's jobs, basically."
00:13:48,00:13:50,And postmen in Glasgow were having to go
00:13:50,00:13:51,"up and down tenement blocks,"
00:13:51,00:13:53,sometimes to just post a letter to one person.
00:13:53,00:13:57,And he walked the full Glasgow postman's route
00:13:57,00:13:58,up and downstairs on his beat
00:13:58,00:14:00,"and came back to the post office and none of them was like,"
00:14:00,00:14:02,"""Hey, those guys have it really rough."
00:14:02,00:14:03,"We need to sort it out."""
00:14:03,00:14:04,- Yes.
00:14:04,00:14:06,- His second-ever novel sold 140 copies.
00:14:06,00:14:07,- Okay.
00:14:07,00:14:08,"- Yeah, it did not sell."
00:14:08,00:14:10,- What's that one?
00:14:10,00:14:12,"- They were both set in Ireland, his first two."
00:14:12,00:14:14,I think he saw a picture of them and published them out.
00:14:14,00:14:15,"Oh, I don't know."
00:14:15,00:14:16,"But the publisher had a resort to advert saying,"
00:14:16,00:14:18,"""Do you know who this guy's mum is?"
00:14:18,00:14:20,"This guy's mum is Fanny Truller."""
00:14:20,00:14:22,"- Fanny Truller, which is so embarrassing"
00:14:22,00:14:25,"as a young debut novelist, you know."
00:14:25,00:14:27,What a quote for the front of the book.
00:14:27,00:14:29,"""Do you know who his mum is?"""
00:14:29,00:14:32,(upbeat music)
00:14:32,00:14:37,"- Okay, it is time for fact number two."
00:14:37,00:14:38,And that is my fact.
00:14:38,00:14:40,"My fact this week is that in 2008,"
00:14:40,00:14:43,a TV channel spent the day rescheduling shows
00:14:43,00:14:45,so that millions of people in India
00:14:45,00:14:47,could continue to watch a live broadcast
00:14:47,00:14:49,of a man trying to kill another man
00:14:49,00:14:51,using nothing but his mind.
00:14:51,00:14:52,- Okay.
00:14:52,00:14:53,- And it took longer than expected.
00:14:53,00:14:55,Is it like when a football match goes into extra time
00:14:55,00:14:56,and you have to cancel the news afterwards?
00:14:56,00:14:58,- It's like that tennis.
00:14:58,00:15:00,"Do you remember, it was at Mahut Isner?"
00:15:00,00:15:00,- Mahut Isner.
00:15:00,00:15:02,"- Which went on, it was a Wimbledon several,"
00:15:02,00:15:04,"like 10 years ago now, and it went on,"
00:15:04,00:15:06,they played like 70 games each.
00:15:06,00:15:07,"- Yeah, it was something like that."
00:15:07,00:15:08,- It was something like crackers.
00:15:08,00:15:09,"- Yeah, it was kind of that."
00:15:09,00:15:11,"- And Mahut Isner, I imagine, got closer to death"
00:15:11,00:15:14,than the person who was trying to be killed here.
00:15:14,00:15:15,"- Well, not quite, actually."
00:15:15,00:15:18,"So, okay, at that time, there was a politician"
00:15:18,00:15:19,who said out loud that she thought
00:15:19,00:15:21,that someone was attacking her mentally
00:15:21,00:15:23,"using Tantric powers, which is, you know,"
00:15:23,00:15:25,"when we talk about Tantric sex and all that,"
00:15:25,00:15:28,"there's a side of it, which is to do with the mind,"
00:15:28,00:15:30,and you can supposedly attack people
00:15:30,00:15:33,"if you're using the dark practices of it, right?"
00:15:33,00:15:35,"So, as a result, there was a TV show"
00:15:35,00:15:38,where skeptics and Tantra practitioners
00:15:38,00:15:39,"were brought together on the show,"
00:15:39,00:15:42,it was called Tantric Power versus Science.
00:15:42,00:15:44,"And while on the show, this guy who was called"
00:15:44,00:15:48,Pandit Srintheshama claimed that he could kill someone
00:15:48,00:15:50,within minutes using nothing but his mind.
00:15:50,00:15:53,"Now, the person who was sitting on the panel with him"
00:15:53,00:15:55,was a guy called Sinal Edamaruku.
00:15:55,00:15:56,- Is he representing Science in this?
00:15:56,00:16:00,- He is the president of the Rational International Group.
00:16:00,00:16:02,"He says, you can't do that."
00:16:02,00:16:02,You think you can do that?
00:16:02,00:16:04,Do it to me now.
00:16:04,00:16:06,"And the guy says, okay, fine, I'll do it to you now."
00:16:06,00:16:08,"- That's annoying when they call your bluff like that,"
00:16:08,00:16:09,isn't it? - Exactly.
00:16:09,00:16:10,"So, he says, do it now."
00:16:10,00:16:13,"So, they say, all right, let's do this."
00:16:13,00:16:15,"The host of the show is going, all right, let's do this."
00:16:15,00:16:17,"- Legally, very tricky water for the channel"
00:16:17,00:16:18,and the program to be in. - Exactly.
00:16:18,00:16:21,- 'Cause I'm thinking about all the forms
00:16:21,00:16:23,"we have to fill in on QI if you just, you know,"
00:16:23,00:16:24,strike a match.
00:16:24,00:16:28,- You very rarely use dark tantra on QI.
00:16:28,00:16:33,"- So, basically what happens is, is this guy, Sharma gets up"
00:16:33,00:16:35,and he starts focusing his mind on him.
00:16:35,00:16:36,It's clearly not working.
00:16:36,00:16:40,The rational guy is sort of giving laps and so on.
00:16:40,00:16:43,"So, Sharma comes over, he starts sprinkling water on him"
00:16:43,00:16:45,as an intimidation tactic.
00:16:45,00:16:46,He starts ruffling his hair.
00:16:46,00:16:50,"- Oh, the big guns are coming out now."
00:16:50,00:16:51,- He covers his eyes.
00:16:51,00:16:52,- It was all that stuff.
00:16:52,00:16:55,"But then, and this is where it gets a bit desperate,"
00:16:55,00:16:59,he suddenly presses his fingers down onto his forehead
00:16:59,00:17:01,and steadily really pushes and pushes
00:17:01,00:17:05,"and he has to be called out because basically,"
00:17:05,00:17:06,you will kill me 'cause you're trying
00:17:06,00:17:08,"to crush my skull, basically."
00:17:08,00:17:10,"So, he has to go back to his seat"
00:17:10,00:17:12,and he has to do it with his mind.
00:17:12,00:17:14,"Now, at this point, the show's meant to be ending."
00:17:14,00:17:15,But they say it's not done yet.
00:17:15,00:17:18,"So, the show continues and the next show is canceled."
00:17:18,00:17:20,"And at this point, word is getting around."
00:17:20,00:17:21,"So, people are tuning in and tuning in."
00:17:21,00:17:23,"After a couple of hours, the guy's exhausted,"
00:17:23,00:17:25,"Sharma's exhausted and he says,"
00:17:25,00:17:26,"""But I'm not done yet."
00:17:26,00:17:27,"""Let's meet again this evening."
00:17:27,00:17:31,"""And this evening, I will do the ultimate destruction ceremony"
00:17:31,00:17:32,"""and kill you."""
00:17:32,00:17:33,"What is going through his mind when he's saying,"
00:17:33,00:17:35,"""I'm gonna do that?"""
00:17:35,00:17:37,I'm sure I can think of an ultimate destruction ceremony
00:17:37,00:17:39,in the two hours between the broadcast.
00:17:39,00:17:40,"Like, what is his plan?"
00:17:40,00:17:44,"- But then, I think his plan probably is to not turn up"
00:17:44,00:17:47,"and then go, ""Oh, sorry, I was killing some other person."""
00:17:47,00:17:49,"They go to another school, you wouldn't know them."
00:17:49,00:17:51,"- Yeah, so they do it at night."
00:17:51,00:17:53,It's performed under an altar in an open night sky.
00:17:53,00:17:55,They've got all the cameras there
00:17:55,00:17:56,and he tries and tries and tries.
00:17:56,00:17:59,"And obviously, the guy who's the rational guy"
00:17:59,00:18:00,is laughing his ass off the whole time.
00:18:00,00:18:01,"So, it didn't work out."
00:18:01,00:18:03,"But this, just to remind you, is 2008."
00:18:03,00:18:05,And this was broadcast live.
00:18:05,00:18:07,"And according to many reports,"
00:18:07,00:18:09,"some say hundreds of millions,"
00:18:09,00:18:10,obviously a huge population in India.
00:18:10,00:18:14,"But millions tuned in to see a man killed live on TV,"
00:18:14,00:18:15,"probably knowing he wasn't gonna be,"
00:18:15,00:18:17,but wanted to see what happened.
00:18:17,00:18:18,- I have a question for you guys.
00:18:18,00:18:20,If you were on that TV show
00:18:20,00:18:21,and you were next to a tantric master
00:18:21,00:18:24,"and they said, ""I could kill someone with my mind,"""
00:18:24,00:18:27,"would you have the courage to say,"
00:18:27,00:18:29,"""No, you can't do it to me."""
00:18:29,00:18:30,You definitely would.
00:18:30,00:18:32,There wouldn't be a tiny bit of doubt
00:18:32,00:18:34,"that like, I'm pretty sure you can't."
00:18:34,00:18:36,"- Once he started, I'd shit my pants."
00:18:36,00:18:38,"But yeah, I would probably call it."
00:18:38,00:18:39,- I would feel fairly confident
00:18:39,00:18:40,that that wouldn't happen.
00:18:40,00:18:42,"- No, but you can't be fairly confident."
00:18:42,00:18:44,"- Okay, I would be 100% certain"
00:18:44,00:18:45,that that wouldn't happen.
00:18:45,00:18:46,- You'd be up for it.
00:18:46,00:18:49,"- I would be pretty confident,"
00:18:49,00:18:50,"but I would think to myself,"
00:18:50,00:18:52,"""I'd be so annoyed if I have a heart attack and die."""
00:18:52,00:18:53,Unrelatedly.
00:18:53,00:18:56,"- When I went to, I was in Bhutan"
00:18:56,00:18:59,and I went to the tiger's nest monastery.
00:18:59,00:19:01,And there's a little bit where you have to jump
00:19:01,00:19:03,from one bit to the other
00:19:03,00:19:07,and you're going over a sheer drop of thousands of feet.
00:19:07,00:19:10,And the step is basically just a step.
00:19:10,00:19:12,It's a step that you do every single day
00:19:12,00:19:14,and it's no problem.
00:19:14,00:19:15,"But all the way through, I was thinking,"
00:19:15,00:19:18,"""If I fall now, what a fucking idiot."
00:19:18,00:19:21,"""What an idiot I am to be doing that."""
00:19:21,00:19:23,And I suppose it's that kind of thought.
00:19:23,00:19:25,- And the pressure of the TV cameras
00:19:25,00:19:28,"will make you think, ""This is a very public forum."""
00:19:28,00:19:30,"I can understand, I'm very impressed by the skeptic."
00:19:30,00:19:31,- You'd feel embarrassed for him.
00:19:31,00:19:33,You'd start wanting to die.
00:19:33,00:19:35,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:19:35,00:19:35,- You'd fake it.
00:19:35,00:19:37,"- Do you think you'd fake it, Dan?"
00:19:37,00:19:38,- I'd fake it.
00:19:38,00:19:40,"- Well, it would be really fun"
00:19:40,00:19:42,to draw the death Tantra dude out
00:19:42,00:19:45,"by pretending to die and then like, ""Aaah."""
00:19:45,00:19:46,And that would be great.
00:19:46,00:19:47,- That's a good point.
00:19:47,00:19:48,- I've never heard of this.
00:19:48,00:19:52,I think of Tantra as primarily a sexual thing.
00:19:52,00:19:55,"Now, I'm thinking about Sting."
00:19:55,00:19:56,- Yes.
00:19:56,00:19:59,"- Who proclaimed, I think, in the 90s"
00:19:59,00:20:02,that he could have sex for five hours because of Tantra.
00:20:02,00:20:04,Just Tantric skills.
00:20:04,00:20:05,- He says he never said that.
00:20:05,00:20:07,"- I don't know if he does now, but that's--"
00:20:07,00:20:08,- Right.
00:20:08,00:20:10,"- He says, ""Bob Geldoff spread that rumor."""
00:20:10,00:20:10,- Right.
00:20:10,00:20:11,- Yeah.
00:20:11,00:20:12,"- And then he said, ""Oh, I said five hours,"
00:20:12,00:20:14,but that includes dinner and a movie
00:20:14,00:20:15,"followed by some begging."""
00:20:15,00:20:16,"You know, he's got some very funny jokes about it."
00:20:16,00:20:17,"Yeah, yeah."
00:20:17,00:20:18,But that was--
00:20:18,00:20:19,- No movie is.
00:20:19,00:20:20,- Lord of the Rings.
00:20:20,00:20:22,- The entire trilogy.
00:20:22,00:20:24,"- No, but I don't know anything about Tantra, really."
00:20:24,00:20:25,"Although the idea of Tantra,"
00:20:25,00:20:26,and I gather it's more of a philosophy
00:20:26,00:20:27,or a set of philosophies.
00:20:27,00:20:29,And it's from lots of different--
00:20:29,00:20:30,- Very complicated.
00:20:30,00:20:32,- Lots of different religions have elements of Tantra.
00:20:32,00:20:33,"- Definitely, yeah."
00:20:33,00:20:35,- That sort of spread across all these different schools
00:20:35,00:20:36,of thought.
00:20:36,00:20:37,- There's no one thing.
00:20:37,00:20:40,"And when I say the dark side or whatever,"
00:20:40,00:20:42,"that's so rare, it's not really even a thing."
00:20:42,00:20:44,"We'll get letters, people saying,"
00:20:44,00:20:44,"""That's not a thing."""
00:20:44,00:20:45,"- Right, right, right, yeah."
00:20:45,00:20:46,"- Well, there's space in Hinduism."
00:20:46,00:20:47,- Yeah.
00:20:47,00:20:48,- When we say lots of different religions.
00:20:48,00:20:51,And it's not its own belief system within Hinduism
00:20:51,00:20:52,as far as I can tell.
00:20:52,00:20:54,It's like a series of practices
00:20:54,00:20:57,which seem to exist in lots of strands of Hinduism.
00:20:57,00:20:59,"- Yeah, it's almost like non-Orphodox Hinduism."
00:20:59,00:21:00,- Yeah.
00:21:00,00:21:02,"In fact, I did read things saying the whole point of it"
00:21:02,00:21:05,was to subvert Hinduism and encourage lots of things
00:21:05,00:21:07,that Hinduism does not.
00:21:07,00:21:09,"Like, I think there's one where you're encouraged"
00:21:09,00:21:12,"to have the special Tantric fivesm,"
00:21:12,00:21:14,"which is like eating meat, drinking wine."
00:21:14,00:21:15,- Right.
00:21:15,00:21:16,(all laughing)
00:21:16,00:21:17,- Have you ever had a fivesm?
00:21:17,00:21:21,"Yeah, I've had a bit of meat and a drink, a bit of wine, yeah?"
00:21:21,00:21:22,- Coming to the party to make it.
00:21:22,00:21:23,- I didn't have--
00:21:23,00:21:24,- Wine's everyone in there.
00:21:24,00:21:25,- Yes.
00:21:25,00:21:27,"- God, that looks delicious."
00:21:27,00:21:28,I've had a foursome.
00:21:28,00:21:30,"I didn't have the sherry at the end,"
00:21:30,00:21:31,"which would have been, you know."
00:21:31,00:21:33,"- To be fair, sex is the last one."
00:21:33,00:21:35,"- Oh, okay, okay."
00:21:35,00:21:35,So it's like a date.
00:21:35,00:21:36,We're not describing a date.
00:21:36,00:21:38,- Are we describing a date?
00:21:38,00:21:39,- What are the previous four?
00:21:39,00:21:39,Is there an order?
00:21:39,00:21:40,- Netflix.
00:21:40,00:21:41,- Sorry.
00:21:41,00:21:47,"- It's drinking, eating, movie, begging."
00:21:47,00:21:48,(all laughing)
00:21:48,00:21:49,Sex.
00:21:49,00:21:53,"- So the five are alcohol, meat, fish, grain, and sex."
00:21:53,00:21:54,- Okay.
00:21:54,00:21:55,"- You're very full at that point,"
00:21:55,00:21:56,so it's not very pleasant.
00:21:56,00:21:57,"- We do that five at home,"
00:21:57,00:21:59,but the fifth one is always headache.
00:21:59,00:22:01,(all laughing)
00:22:01,00:22:03,- I'm really annoyed.
00:22:03,00:22:06,- But the idea is violating all these Hindu taboos.
00:22:06,00:22:07,- I see.
00:22:07,00:22:10,- And I think that's called left-handed tantra.
00:22:10,00:22:12,"So there's left-handed tantra and right-handed tantra,"
00:22:12,00:22:14,and left-handed tantra is the sex one.
00:22:14,00:22:15,- I'm left-handed.
00:22:15,00:22:16,"- Well, that doesn't surprise me."
00:22:16,00:22:17,"- No, no, no, no."
00:22:17,00:22:19,It's all starting to come together.
00:22:19,00:22:21,"- I always do left-handed tantra,"
00:22:21,00:22:23,'cause it feels like someone else is doing that.
00:22:23,00:22:26,(all laughing)
00:22:26,00:22:29,- There's no thousand-year-old tradition
00:22:29,00:22:30,we can be trusted with.
00:22:30,00:22:32,(all laughing)
00:22:32,00:22:35,- Other things that are done in tantra traditions
00:22:35,00:22:38,"that are non-sexual for the right-handed,"
00:22:38,00:22:40,"living in cemeteries, if you want that,"
00:22:40,00:22:42,and smearing cremation ashes on your body.
00:22:42,00:22:45,So these are all agori rituals.
00:22:45,00:22:47,- And do you say agori?
00:22:47,00:22:47,- Yeah.
00:22:47,00:22:48,- 'Cause it sounds quite gory.
00:22:48,00:22:51,"- Oh yeah, agori tradition, yes."
00:22:51,00:22:53,- I was just missering.
00:22:53,00:22:53,"- No, that's very good."
00:22:53,00:22:57,"Maybe it's a fun play on words, 'cause it is very dark."
00:22:57,00:22:59,"They smoke a lot of marijuana,"
00:22:59,00:23:00,"not too dark, they drink a lot of alcohol,"
00:23:00,00:23:02,and they meditate on top of corpses.
00:23:02,00:23:03,"- I got some good news for you, Dan."
00:23:03,00:23:05,- Yeah.
00:23:05,00:23:07,- So they're meditating on a corpse.
00:23:07,00:23:09,There are quite a lot of rules
00:23:09,00:23:12,about the kind of corpse that you can meditate on.
00:23:12,00:23:14,"Ideally, it would be someone who died from drowning,"
00:23:14,00:23:17,"lightning strikes, snake bites, something like that."
00:23:17,00:23:19,You are allowed to kill the person
00:23:19,00:23:22,"before you meditate on top of them,"
00:23:22,00:23:26,but you shouldn't really meditate on top of a man
00:23:26,00:23:29,with a beard or on top of a wife guy.
00:23:29,00:23:34,"- Anyone who's hand-packed, you shouldn't be doing."
00:23:34,00:23:35,- Really?
00:23:35,00:23:37,"- Wow, Dan, you're in the clear."
00:23:37,00:23:40,"- I am safe and sound, guys."
00:23:40,00:23:43,- Wow.
00:23:43,00:23:46,"- But what about a clean-shaven bad boy like me, James?"
00:23:46,00:23:49,Am I in the firing line for getting meditated on?
00:23:49,00:23:50,- Oh dear.
00:23:50,00:23:52,- That's amazing.
00:23:52,00:23:55,"- I read an amazing way of if someone,"
00:23:55,00:23:57,"if so, let's say we are on that show"
00:23:57,00:24:00,"and we have said yes, consenting to Sharma"
00:24:00,00:24:02,trying to kill us with his mind.
00:24:02,00:24:05,One way of getting him out of your mind
00:24:05,00:24:08,and shaking off the bad juju that's inside there
00:24:08,00:24:09,is something that was practiced
00:24:09,00:24:13,"by a guy called Viktor Kortchnoy, who's a chess player."
00:24:13,00:24:14,- Yeah.
00:24:14,00:24:16,"- Now, we spoke many episodes ago"
00:24:16,00:24:20,"about a very famous chess championship in 1978,"
00:24:20,00:24:22,"and there were two Russian grandmaster chess players,"
00:24:22,00:24:25,Karpov against Kortchnoy.
00:24:25,00:24:28,"And basically, Kortchnoy, as he was sitting there,"
00:24:28,00:24:32,had a guy in the audience who was mentally trying
00:24:32,00:24:33,"to ruin his game, get into his head."
00:24:33,00:24:37,"It was the weirdest chess game ever, right?"
00:24:37,00:24:39,Kortchnoy eventually brings in two people
00:24:39,00:24:43,who practice the idea of all this mind power stuff.
00:24:43,00:24:45,And he genuinely did this during the course of the game
00:24:45,00:24:48,to get rid of all the bad thoughts that were in his head.
00:24:48,00:24:51,You do a handstand so that you can shake it out
00:24:51,00:24:53,"using the gravity that's pulling down to the earth,"
00:24:53,00:24:54,all the bad vibes.
00:24:54,00:24:56,"So, if ever you're in a space"
00:24:56,00:24:59,"where you think you're being infiltrated in your mind,"
00:24:59,00:25:00,do a handstand.
00:25:00,00:25:02,"- If you believe, though."
00:25:02,00:25:03,- Yeah.
00:25:03,00:25:04,"- I mean, we're sort of skirting around the psychosomatic thing."
00:25:04,00:25:06,If you believe that someone is in the crowd
00:25:06,00:25:06,getting into your head.
00:25:06,00:25:07,- Which he did.
00:25:07,00:25:08,- Then they're already in there.
00:25:08,00:25:09,- Yeah.
00:25:09,00:25:10,- And he was in there.
00:25:10,00:25:11,"Like, that's exactly it."
00:25:11,00:25:12,He believed that was in there.
00:25:12,00:25:13,- Did he win?
00:25:13,00:25:14,- He lost.
00:25:14,00:25:15,Only just by one game.
00:25:15,00:25:17,"He was down, and then he did the handstand thing,"
00:25:17,00:25:19,and he came back for like a few games.
00:25:19,00:25:20,And then he lost the final game.
00:25:20,00:25:23,"- Didn't shake that last bit out, did he?"
00:25:23,00:25:28,"- This just reminded me of another interesting Hindu sect,"
00:25:28,00:25:30,"which I've been fond of for a while, the Nagasadhus."
00:25:30,00:25:31,- Okay.
00:25:31,00:25:34,"- Which, we've talked about the Naked Sadhus,"
00:25:34,00:25:35,which who are just naked all the time?
00:25:35,00:25:36,- Sadhus.
00:25:36,00:25:38,"- Naked Sadhus, yeah."
00:25:38,00:25:40,"So, a lot of this is about asceticism"
00:25:40,00:25:41,and renouncing everything.
00:25:41,00:25:44,And they have very strict exercise routines.
00:25:44,00:25:46,"So, they're very fit, but they have long beards,"
00:25:46,00:25:48,but they have no clothes.
00:25:48,00:25:51,They also smear themselves in ashes.
00:25:51,00:25:53,I think this seems to be a thing.
00:25:53,00:25:56,But they were great fighters back in the day.
00:25:56,00:25:57,"So, they've been around for many hundreds,"
00:25:57,00:25:59,for thousands of years.
00:25:59,00:26:00,And they were military men.
00:26:00,00:26:02,"So, in 19th century reports,"
00:26:02,00:26:03,"they wore nothing but a belt,"
00:26:03,00:26:06,and they'd have ammunition and flints and guns
00:26:06,00:26:07,hanging off their belt.
00:26:07,00:26:08,"- Wow, like Batman."
00:26:08,00:26:10,"- Yeah, but nude Batman."
00:26:10,00:26:12,"- Yes, 'cause he normally is wearing"
00:26:12,00:26:13,the full Batman outfit.
00:26:13,00:26:15,"- He's in fact a bit too covered up, really."
00:26:15,00:26:17,"- Yeah, yeah, but I'm just mean like the utility belt."
00:26:17,00:26:19,"- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, absolutely."
00:26:19,00:26:20,- They've got the utility belt.
00:26:20,00:26:22,"And that's all you need, really."
00:26:22,00:26:25,And they were great military leaders.
00:26:25,00:26:26,"And in fact, there was one in the 18th century"
00:26:26,00:26:28,"who commanded over 20,000 men."
00:26:28,00:26:30,"In fact, quite a few of them commanded that many."
00:26:30,00:26:34,And in the battles that the British East India Company had
00:26:34,00:26:35,"when they were trying to colonize India,"
00:26:35,00:26:37,they played a huge role.
00:26:37,00:26:39,"And bizarrely, they were often mercenaries."
00:26:39,00:26:41,"So, they often fought for different sides,"
00:26:41,00:26:44,which is weird given that they renounce all possessions.
00:26:44,00:26:46,"So, I don't know what you're using,"
00:26:46,00:26:47,all that money you're getting paid.
00:26:47,00:26:48,"- Oh, you gotta, you know, there are,"
00:26:48,00:26:51,"there are incidental expenditures and you, you know,"
00:26:51,00:26:52,you want to have something for a rainy day.
00:26:52,00:26:54,- You want a really nice belt.
00:26:54,00:26:57,(all laughing)
00:26:57,00:26:59,"- That beard oil's very pricey, um."
00:26:59,00:27:02,(all laughing)
00:27:02,00:27:04,(upbeat music)
00:27:04,00:27:10,"- Okay, it is time for fact number three."
00:27:10,00:27:12,And that is James.
00:27:12,00:27:14,"- Okay, my fact this week is that the last thing"
00:27:14,00:27:18,that British soldiers going to the Crimean War saw
00:27:18,00:27:20,was Queen Victoria throwing a shoe at them.
00:27:20,00:27:22,(all laughing)
00:27:22,00:27:23,- And stay out.
00:27:23,00:27:25,(all laughing)
00:27:25,00:27:27,"- No, this is a good luck thing."
00:27:27,00:27:30,It's been a good luck thing since the 16th century at least.
00:27:30,00:27:32,"And Queen Victoria, when she got married,"
00:27:32,00:27:34,she had shoes thrown after her.
00:27:34,00:27:37,"So, she obviously had this idea that it was good luck."
00:27:37,00:27:40,And there is an 1854 sketch from Punch Magazine
00:27:40,00:27:43,that shows her throwing a shoe at her soldiers
00:27:43,00:27:45,as they go off for the Crimean War.
00:27:45,00:27:47,"- It's very, I'd never heard this tradition at all."
00:27:47,00:27:49,Shoe-trucking for luck.
00:27:49,00:27:50,"I've just never, ever heard it."
00:27:50,00:27:51,But she did it a lot.
00:27:51,00:27:52,She did it in 1855.
00:27:52,00:27:55,She chucked shoes into Balmoral Castle again for luck.
00:27:55,00:27:56,And that was a.
00:27:56,00:27:58,- And is it she takes one of her own shoes off
00:27:58,00:27:59,or does she take an extra shoe in her handbag?
00:27:59,00:28:00,- Great question.
00:28:00,00:28:01,- Good question.
00:28:01,00:28:02,- Don't know.
00:28:02,00:28:03,"- Yeah, so the first one she's throwing it off"
00:28:03,00:28:06,"from where she's, she's standing on a balcony."
00:28:06,00:28:07,- That's right.
00:28:07,00:28:07,"- So, okay, so she's at home."
00:28:07,00:28:09,She's probably in slippers anyway.
00:28:09,00:28:11,"So, she could do that with a shoe."
00:28:11,00:28:12,- And you don't want to chuck a really heavy shoe
00:28:12,00:28:13,in case I hit someone.
00:28:13,00:28:13,- Yeah.
00:28:13,00:28:14,"- Well, it's from a balcony."
00:28:14,00:28:15,It seems quite risky.
00:28:15,00:28:16,- That's gonna be my question.
00:28:16,00:28:17,Do we know where the shoe is?
00:28:17,00:28:19,"'Cause I couldn't, I couldn't find it."
00:28:19,00:28:20,- The shoe?
00:28:20,00:28:20,"- Yeah, the shoe."
00:28:20,00:28:22,- I don't know how many of you have been victorious.
00:28:22,00:28:24,"- Yeah, shoes are forever."
00:28:24,00:28:27,"- Yeah, but the shoe, lots of shoe traditions."
00:28:27,00:28:28,Hiding shoes in the walls of your building.
00:28:28,00:28:29,"That was not the big one, wasn't it?"
00:28:29,00:28:30,- Yeah.
00:28:30,00:28:32,- Is that for good luck?
00:28:32,00:28:33,Or just for a rainy day?
00:28:33,00:28:35,- To ward off evil.
00:28:35,00:28:36,"- Ah, evil hates shoes."
00:28:36,00:28:39,"- Yes, the Northampton made all,"
00:28:39,00:28:41,basically all the shoes made in the UK
00:28:41,00:28:41,came from Northampton.
00:28:41,00:28:42,- Really?
00:28:42,00:28:43,"- Yeah, 'cause it was Chewtown."
00:28:43,00:28:45,- That's why the football team's called the Cobblers.
00:28:45,00:28:46,"- Oh, is it?"
00:28:46,00:28:47,I didn't know they were.
00:28:47,00:28:49,But they've got a thing called the Hidden Shoe Index
00:28:49,00:28:51,at the Northampton Museum.
00:28:51,00:28:53,"- I read it was called the Concealed Shoe Index,"
00:28:53,00:28:56,which made me wonder what CSI Northampton would be like.
00:28:56,00:28:58,(laughing)
00:28:58,00:28:58,- Very strong.
00:28:58,00:29:00,I don't know which is the true name.
00:29:00,00:29:02,"It goes back to the '50s though,"
00:29:02,00:29:04,but the oldest shoe they've got or found in a building
00:29:04,00:29:06,dates back to 1308.
00:29:06,00:29:07,- Wow.
00:29:07,00:29:08,"- That was concealed in a building, yeah."
00:29:08,00:29:09,"- That's not gonna be wearable, is it?"
00:29:09,00:29:10,- No.
00:29:10,00:29:11,"- Is this related to,"
00:29:11,00:29:13,I mentioned cats being found in buildings.
00:29:13,00:29:14,"That's the thing, isn't it?"
00:29:14,00:29:16,That people would bury their dead cats.
00:29:16,00:29:19,"- Yeah, war-lover's cat, frogs as well."
00:29:19,00:29:20,"- Frogs, yes."
00:29:20,00:29:21,Presumably that was for good luck.
00:29:21,00:29:26,- I think it's to also attract or distract or deter witches.
00:29:26,00:29:27,We're back to the evil thing.
00:29:27,00:29:28,- Distract.
00:29:28,00:29:29,Is that what I kept?
00:29:29,00:29:30,(laughing)
00:29:30,00:29:31,That's what I was doing.
00:29:31,00:29:33,Maybe one of the most famous shoe-throwing incidents
00:29:33,00:29:37,"is when George Bush had two shoes thrown at him, in fact."
00:29:37,00:29:40,It's in 2008 by an Iraqi reporter.
00:29:40,00:29:44,"And actually, I was rereading what George Bush said"
00:29:44,00:29:45,when he was asked about it afterwards.
00:29:45,00:29:47,"And I thought, you know,"
00:29:47,00:29:48,there was a lot of criticism of George Bush
00:29:48,00:29:49,"at the time, understandably."
00:29:49,00:29:52,"But he said, ""I know I wasn't offended."
00:29:52,00:29:54,"""We're in a democracy."
00:29:54,00:29:55,"""This is freedom for you."
00:29:55,00:29:58,"""You're allowed to do this kind of thing."""
00:29:58,00:29:59,"Which is very mature of him, well done."
00:29:59,00:30:00,- The guy was then imprisoned
00:30:00,00:30:03,and I think beaten very badly.
00:30:03,00:30:05,"- He asked a lot of tea, I think."
00:30:05,00:30:07,"- I think it was by the Iraqi authorities,"
00:30:07,00:30:08,rather than by anyone else.
00:30:08,00:30:10,"But yes, it was a sentiment bang on."
00:30:10,00:30:13,"- They did a massive shoe statue, didn't they?"
00:30:13,00:30:14,Statue.
00:30:14,00:30:14,- Didn't they?
00:30:14,00:30:15,- Yeah.
00:30:15,00:30:16,- Nice.
00:30:16,00:30:17,"- Wait, who's in Iraq?"
00:30:17,00:30:18,"- In Iraq, yeah."
00:30:18,00:30:20,"But it was done, I think it was done at a university"
00:30:20,00:30:21,or something and they had to take it down
00:30:21,00:30:24,'cause it was seen as being political.
00:30:24,00:30:24,"- When they tore it down,"
00:30:24,00:30:25,did they run over and beat it
00:30:25,00:30:27,with miniature statues of Saddam Hussein?
00:30:27,00:30:30,(laughing)
00:30:30,00:30:32,- I love that the museum in America
00:30:32,00:30:35,"that has, as one of its exhibits, a replica of the shoe."
00:30:35,00:30:36,"- Oh, really?"
00:30:36,00:30:37,Not even the shoe?
00:30:37,00:30:39,"- No, the shoes were destroyed by the CIA."
00:30:39,00:30:40,- Right.
00:30:40,00:30:43,"- Sorry, I've never sounded more conspiracies"
00:30:43,00:30:44,and winged that whack-off.
00:30:44,00:30:46,"Sorry, but they actually were,"
00:30:46,00:30:48,because I think they didn't want the shoes to become martyrs.
00:30:48,00:30:51,- Do the CIA need to be drafted into destroy shoes?
00:30:51,00:30:52,I reckon you get the intern.
00:30:52,00:30:53,- Maybe it was the FBI.
00:30:53,00:30:54,"- Or the Secret Service, maybe."
00:30:54,00:30:56,"- It was the Secret Service, sorry, it was the Secret Service."
00:30:56,00:30:57,But it became big business as well.
00:30:57,00:30:59,"All these rival cobalas in the area started claiming,"
00:30:59,00:31:02,"""Oh yes, that's our shoe."""
00:31:02,00:31:02,- Really?
00:31:02,00:31:03,- Yeah.
00:31:03,00:31:06,"And the thrower, Mundar al-Zaidi,"
00:31:06,00:31:09,he was offered a couple of hands in marriage
00:31:09,00:31:11,"by various people who said,"
00:31:11,00:31:14,"""I'd like you to marry my daughter."""
00:31:14,00:31:16,"And then, in 2009, he was doing an event,"
00:31:16,00:31:19,"the year after he did the thing, guess what happened?"
00:31:19,00:31:20,- You got a shoe thrown at him?
00:31:20,00:31:21,- He got a shoe thrown at him.
00:31:21,00:31:23,"Yeah, it was a real circle of life thing."
00:31:23,00:31:25,"- Come up and buy Bush, or?"
00:31:25,00:31:26,- Not buy Bush.
00:31:26,00:31:28,(all laughing)
00:31:28,00:31:30,- But Bush has had more shoes thrown at him since.
00:31:30,00:31:32,"There's a whole, I mean, it became a thing"
00:31:32,00:31:33,post that event generally.
00:31:33,00:31:35,So there's a whole Wikipedia page
00:31:35,00:31:37,"where it's a shoe throwing incident, it's called,"
00:31:37,00:31:39,"and it gives you a big timeline,"
00:31:39,00:31:44,and it really picks up after old mate Bush was attacked.
00:31:44,00:31:46,There's a famous incident as well.
00:31:46,00:31:49,"Queen Elizabeth, the late Queen, in Australia."
00:31:49,00:31:50,- Second?
00:31:50,00:31:50,- Yeah.
00:31:50,00:31:54,She threw a shoe at Philip when they were in Australia.
00:31:54,00:31:56,"It was one of the only moments where a fight,"
00:31:56,00:31:58,"I think in fact, the only incident in which a fight"
00:31:58,00:32:00,"was seen between Philip and the Queen,"
00:32:00,00:32:02,she threw a tennis racket at him as well.
00:32:02,00:32:03,- A tennis racket?
00:32:03,00:32:04,- Yeah.
00:32:04,00:32:06,"- The Aussies were filming from a distance,"
00:32:06,00:32:08,"and they were like, ""Geez, what did we just see?"""
00:32:08,00:32:10,'Cause we've never seen anything like that before.
00:32:10,00:32:12,And so one of the PR people had to come out for the Queen
00:32:12,00:32:14,"and say, ""What are you guys doing?"""
00:32:14,00:32:17,"With a British accent, they're like, ""Oh, the Nazi accent."""
00:32:17,00:32:18,"And then the Queen came out, and she apologised,"
00:32:18,00:32:19,"and she said, ""Where do you want me?"""
00:32:19,00:32:21,"As if to say, ""Please don't use that."
00:32:21,00:32:24,"""I'm here now as an embarrassing apology"
00:32:24,00:32:25,"""for you witnessing that."""
00:32:25,00:32:28,But possibly she was wishing him good luck.
00:32:28,00:32:29,(all laughing)
00:32:29,00:32:30,- Or whatever affair.
00:32:30,00:32:33,"- With a lucky tennis racket as well, yeah."
00:32:33,00:32:35,- All of your lucky clothes are out on the lawn.
00:32:35,00:32:38,(all laughing)
00:32:38,00:32:39,- That's so funny.
00:32:39,00:32:40,- Wow.
00:32:40,00:32:41,"James, have you ever seen..."
00:32:41,00:32:43,I'm asking James specifically this for a reason.
00:32:43,00:32:44,Have you ever seen a panty tree?
00:32:44,00:32:46,(all laughing)
00:32:46,00:32:49,"- We know the reason, panty tree."
00:32:49,00:32:51,"- No, but I think I can guess what it is."
00:32:51,00:32:53,Is it a tree where people leave their pants?
00:32:53,00:32:54,- That's right.
00:32:54,00:32:56,- Why would I have seen it?
00:32:56,00:32:57,"- Why would you specifically, isn't it?"
00:32:57,00:32:58,- Is it common in Bolton?
00:32:58,00:33:00,- It's not a Bolton thing.
00:33:00,00:33:01,- I bet it's a golf thing.
00:33:01,00:33:02,"- Oh, it's a sporting thing."
00:33:03,00:33:05,- I thought it was just because James makes a habit
00:33:05,00:33:07,of visiting all the weird places in the world.
00:33:07,00:33:08,And it sounds weird.
00:33:08,00:33:10,- And it's a pervert.
00:33:10,00:33:12,"Or maybe I'm like Tom Jones and wherever I walk,"
00:33:12,00:33:14,people just throw pants at me.
00:33:14,00:33:14,- That's it.
00:33:14,00:33:16,- Whenever I'm walking in the forest.
00:33:16,00:33:17,(all laughing)
00:33:17,00:33:19,"- You are the panty tree, actually."
00:33:19,00:33:20,(all laughing)
00:33:20,00:33:23,"- No, the reason I asked is 'cause I know James"
00:33:23,00:33:24,has been on a skiing holiday.
00:33:24,00:33:25,- Yeah.
00:33:25,00:33:28,"- But I think you, probably all of you guys"
00:33:28,00:33:30,in metropolitan elites are always skiing.
00:33:30,00:33:33,"But no, apparently it's a thing on for a ski lift"
00:33:33,00:33:34,"because your ski lift goes very high, doesn't it?"
00:33:34,00:33:36,And it passes over some trees.
00:33:36,00:33:38,"And in some ski resorts, there are trees"
00:33:38,00:33:42,where people chuck their panties onto the tree.
00:33:42,00:33:43,- I've seen that.
00:33:43,00:33:45,And I thought it was a Mardi Gras thing.
00:33:45,00:33:46,But there were loads.
00:33:46,00:33:50,"And there was lots of sparkly, bras-y, panty."
00:33:50,00:33:51,"Oh my God, and that's a thing."
00:33:51,00:33:52,- That's a thing.
00:33:52,00:33:55,"I think they don't love it, the skiing authorities."
00:33:55,00:33:56,- Why do they care?
00:33:56,00:33:57,- I don't know.
00:33:57,00:33:58,(all laughing)
00:33:58,00:33:59,"- Sorry, I don't know."
00:33:59,00:34:00,- What's their problem?
00:34:00,00:34:00,- It's hard to get your neck.
00:34:00,00:34:01,- Literate.
00:34:01,00:34:02,"- Yeah, it is, yeah."
00:34:02,00:34:03,It must be hard to get your knickers off
00:34:03,00:34:04,on a ski lift though.
00:34:04,00:34:05,"Like, that's a tough."
00:34:05,00:34:06,- I don't think they're doing that at all.
00:34:06,00:34:07,(all laughing)
00:34:07,00:34:09,- 'Cause you're wearing like your ski suit.
00:34:09,00:34:09,- Exactly.
00:34:09,00:34:11,- And you've gotta pull them off
00:34:11,00:34:13,and then pull them all over the ski.
00:34:13,00:34:13,- Exactly.
00:34:13,00:34:14,- I don't think it's possible.
00:34:14,00:34:15,- And your skis as well.
00:34:15,00:34:17,(all laughing)
00:34:17,00:34:19,"- You have to take your skis off, they're gonna fall."
00:34:19,00:34:20,- Yeah.
00:34:20,00:34:21,"- No, I reckon it's a spare pair of pants"
00:34:21,00:34:23,"situation in the pocket, isn't it?"
00:34:23,00:34:24,- Very interesting.
00:34:24,00:34:25,- Probably is it.
00:34:25,00:34:25,- Very interesting.
00:34:25,00:34:26,- Yeah.
00:34:26,00:34:29,- I occasionally have dropped a ski pole
00:34:29,00:34:32,when going up on a ski lift as I'm sure many people have.
00:34:32,00:34:34,And obviously we hire our skis
00:34:34,00:34:35,"and then we went back and we said,"
00:34:35,00:34:38,"""We dropped our ski pole, can we pay for the ski pole?"""
00:34:38,00:34:39,"They said, ""Oh no, don't worry about it."""
00:34:39,00:34:42,"Because at the end of the season,"
00:34:42,00:34:43,"when all the snow melts,"
00:34:43,00:34:46,someone goes up and collects all of the ski poles off
00:34:46,00:34:48,and then they just distribute them between all the shops.
00:34:48,00:34:49,- It's no way.
00:34:49,00:34:50,- That's amazing.
00:34:50,00:34:51,- I don't know if that's true.
00:34:51,00:34:52,- That's what they said.
00:34:52,00:34:52,- That's amazing.
00:34:52,00:34:53,- This was in Italy.
00:34:53,00:34:55,"- It was fine, just give us your panties."
00:34:55,00:34:56,"Give us your panties, mate."
00:34:56,00:34:59,"- In 2016, MPs in the Egyptian parliament"
00:34:59,00:35:00,"attacked each other with shoes,"
00:35:00,00:35:02,or one attacked another with a shoe.
00:35:02,00:35:04,Which I think is quite sorry.
00:35:04,00:35:07,- It's a big drop down from a mass shoe wall.
00:35:07,00:35:08,"- No, it wasn't."
00:35:08,00:35:10,The other one wasn't quick enough off the mark
00:35:10,00:35:11,taking his shoe off.
00:35:11,00:35:12,"He was actually suspended,"
00:35:12,00:35:13,which I don't know why I sound surprised.
00:35:13,00:35:15,I suppose you probably would be from our parliament as well.
00:35:15,00:35:17,"- Did they run with the headline,"
00:35:17,00:35:20,"S open brackets, C closed brackets,"
00:35:20,00:35:21,Andal.
00:35:21,00:35:22,- Ssss.
00:35:22,00:35:23,- Ssandal.
00:35:23,00:35:24,- Ssandal.
00:35:24,00:35:24,- Oh yeah.
00:35:24,00:35:25,- Ssandal.
00:35:25,00:35:27,"- Gosh, that took us all a long time, didn't it?"
00:35:27,00:35:28,"- That was, yeah."
00:35:28,00:35:29,"- No, 'cause I suppose it would have been written"
00:35:29,00:35:30,"in Turkish, so."
00:35:30,00:35:33,(all laughing)
00:35:33,00:35:35,"- But yeah, it sounds like a very exciting moment."
00:35:35,00:35:38,Tolfik Okasha was the MP who got attacked by a shoe
00:35:38,00:35:40,"because he'd had the Israeli envoy round,"
00:35:40,00:35:42,"and one of his fellow MPs objected to that,"
00:35:42,00:35:45,"and got angry and hit him with a shoe,"
00:35:45,00:35:47,and had to be escorted from the house waving a shoe.
00:35:47,00:35:48,I just thought that's a fun addition
00:35:48,00:35:51,to parliamentary goings on if we want to try it out.
00:35:51,00:35:52,- Yeah.
00:35:52,00:35:53,- There's a bit of an irony about Queen Victoria
00:35:53,00:35:55,"showing the shoes at the Crimean War soldiers,"
00:35:55,00:35:59,which is that they had very bad shoe situations
00:35:59,00:36:00,when they got to the war.
00:36:00,00:36:01,"- Oh, nice."
00:36:01,00:36:02,"- Wow, I froze there badly."
00:36:02,00:36:04,- They should have kept that one shoe.
00:36:04,00:36:04,"- Well, yeah."
00:36:04,00:36:07,"They had awful boots, and they got trench foot,"
00:36:07,00:36:10,their feet swelled up in the cold.
00:36:10,00:36:11,The clothing was completely awful.
00:36:11,00:36:13,Sometimes the sole of their shoe would just stick
00:36:13,00:36:15,"to the mud as they lifted their foot up,"
00:36:15,00:36:16,"and the rest of the shoe came,"
00:36:16,00:36:18,"and the sole was left behind,"
00:36:18,00:36:20,'cause the mud was very thick and sticky.
00:36:20,00:36:20,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:36:20,00:36:22,"- Really bad, yeah, yeah."
00:36:22,00:36:23,They had a horrible time.
00:36:23,00:36:25,"- Yeah, it was a tough one."
00:36:25,00:36:26,- It was a tough war.
00:36:26,00:36:27,- Oh.
00:36:27,00:36:28,- It was many of them are.
00:36:28,00:36:30,"- What were the years, the Crimean War?"
00:36:30,00:36:32,- 1853 to six.
00:36:32,00:36:33,"- Yeah, as Anna said."
00:36:33,00:36:34,- Three to six.
00:36:34,00:36:34,- Three to six.
00:36:34,00:36:35,- Three to six.
00:36:35,00:36:36,"- Three to six, yeah."
00:36:36,00:36:37,- 1853 to six.
00:36:37,00:36:38,- Yeah.
00:36:38,00:36:39,- Sorry.
00:36:39,00:36:40,- Right.
00:36:40,00:36:42,- And it was a very complicated war.
00:36:42,00:36:45,"- Yeah, it was basically a blue sash orange"
00:36:45,00:36:48,"about the West trying to limit Russian expansionism,"
00:36:48,00:36:49,wasn't it?
00:36:49,00:36:50,- It's basically the Ottomans coming up
00:36:50,00:36:54,"to the North, the Russians coming out to the West,"
00:36:54,00:36:56,Britain and France having colonial things
00:36:56,00:36:58,"that they didn't want to lose,"
00:36:58,00:37:00,"trying to keep Russia as quiet as possible,"
00:37:00,00:37:03,"and decided to get on the side of the Ottomans,"
00:37:03,00:37:06,"and then attack the underbelly, which is Crimea."
00:37:06,00:37:07,- Yeah.
00:37:07,00:37:09,- And also there were a lot of Ottomans
00:37:09,00:37:10,"living in Crimea at the time,"
00:37:10,00:37:12,so it was a bit of a powder keg anyway.
00:37:12,00:37:14,"- It was a very, very complicated situation."
00:37:14,00:37:16,"Anyway, it started over rights of access"
00:37:16,00:37:18,"to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem,"
00:37:18,00:37:19,which I think we talked about.
00:37:19,00:37:21,Isn't that the one where they have the disagreement
00:37:21,00:37:22,over the ladder?
00:37:22,00:37:23,- It is.
00:37:23,00:37:24,- Yeah.
00:37:24,00:37:25,"- And this was the same thing, basically."
00:37:25,00:37:27,The Ottoman Sultan gave the Catholic priests
00:37:27,00:37:29,a key to the Church in 1852.
00:37:29,00:37:31,"And from that point on, you know, it was like,"
00:37:31,00:37:33,"well, we have to have a war over this."
00:37:33,00:37:34,Basically things escalated from there.
00:37:34,00:37:35,And then suddenly you have got the charge
00:37:35,00:37:36,"of the Light Brigade happening,"
00:37:36,00:37:38,and it's all going disastrously wrong.
00:37:38,00:37:38,- Yeah.
00:37:38,00:37:39,- And Florence Nightingale's having to organize
00:37:39,00:37:40,a lot of stuff.
00:37:40,00:37:42,"- I mean, lots of famous things came from it, I suppose."
00:37:42,00:37:44,"Florence Nightingale, Mary Seacull,"
00:37:44,00:37:45,charge of the Light Brigade.
00:37:45,00:37:46,- Three items of clothing.
00:37:46,00:37:50,"Balaklava, the cardigan."
00:37:50,00:37:51,"- Cardigan, Earl of Cardigan,"
00:37:51,00:37:53,very heavily involved in the Light Brigade.
00:37:53,00:37:54,- It's gotta be a boot.
00:37:54,00:37:55,- You're not gonna get it.
00:37:55,00:37:56,"- Go on, what is it?"
00:37:56,00:37:57,- The Sebastopol hat.
00:37:57,00:37:59,(laughing)
00:37:59,00:38:02,- It's the Raglan sleeve shirt.
00:38:02,00:38:03,- What's that?
00:38:03,00:38:04,"- It's got a different color of,"
00:38:04,00:38:06,the torso is a different color to the sleeves.
00:38:06,00:38:08,It's a baseball jersey.
00:38:08,00:38:12,"But General Fitzroy Somerset, the first Baron Raglan,"
00:38:12,00:38:13,"was not wearing a baseball jersey,"
00:38:13,00:38:15,but it didn't have a Raglan sleeve shirt named after him.
00:38:15,00:38:16,And he was the one who was responsible
00:38:16,00:38:18,for the charge of the Light Brigade going so badly wrong.
00:38:18,00:38:19,- Right.
00:38:19,00:38:20,- He was very old and he was half deaf
00:38:20,00:38:22,and he was not really with it.
00:38:22,00:38:24,"And he said, oh, the Russians are taking some guns over there."
00:38:24,00:38:26,Can you go and stop them taking away the guns?
00:38:26,00:38:28,"And the order was then carried to someone else,"
00:38:28,00:38:30,"the Earl of Cardigan,"
00:38:30,00:38:31,who could not see the guns
00:38:31,00:38:32,'cause he was somewhere completely different.
00:38:32,00:38:33,"And he said, well, those guns,"
00:38:33,00:38:36,"and pointed at this incredibly well-defended gun in place,"
00:38:36,00:38:38,"but at the end of a long, narrow valley,"
00:38:38,00:38:40,just a disastrous place to attack.
00:38:40,00:38:44,"And he said, okay, this isn't gonna go well,"
00:38:44,00:38:45,but fine.
00:38:45,00:38:47,- Don Yacardi's.
00:38:47,00:38:47,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:38:47,00:38:48,"Here's the exact words where,"
00:38:48,00:38:50,here goes the last of the Brudenells
00:38:50,00:38:51,'cause he thought he was just riding straight
00:38:51,00:38:54,to a certain death as a lot of the people in that charge were.
00:38:54,00:38:57,"- Here's another thing that wasn't invented,"
00:38:57,00:38:59,"but someone tried to invent for the Crimea,"
00:38:59,00:39:03,which was a entire city destroying cannon.
00:39:03,00:39:04,This is a massive cannon.
00:39:04,00:39:06,It was 10 meters wide.
00:39:06,00:39:07,The shot is 10 meters wide.
00:39:07,00:39:08,- No.
00:39:08,00:39:10,- And it would weigh 550 tons.
00:39:10,00:39:12,"And the idea is that once it landed,"
00:39:12,00:39:14,it would demolish an entire city.
00:39:14,00:39:16,And it was to be called the Saxo Cannon.
00:39:16,00:39:19,- How are they gonna transport that anywhere?
00:39:19,00:39:20,- Yeah.
00:39:20,00:39:23,"- It's a wacky racer's Acme Roadrunner-style cannon,"
00:39:23,00:39:24,they're making.
00:39:24,00:39:25,- The inventor was a solid inventor.
00:39:25,00:39:26,- Was it not Adolf Sax?
00:39:26,00:39:30,"- It was, the inventor of the saxophone came up"
00:39:30,00:39:32,"with a city destroying cannon,"
00:39:32,00:39:33,which he really wanted to build.
00:39:33,00:39:34,- He was such a weird guy.
00:39:34,00:39:35,He would just invent these things
00:39:35,00:39:38,and then just call it the Sax something.
00:39:38,00:39:39,- Exactly.
00:39:39,00:39:40,"- So never, it didn't take off."
00:39:40,00:39:42,"- No, didn't get past the planning stages."
00:39:42,00:39:43,- No.
00:39:43,00:39:44,- That's what we wanted to do.
00:39:44,00:39:46,"- Take off, very nice."
00:39:46,00:39:50,"- Something else the Chromium War gave us is,"
00:39:50,00:39:52,"I think the earliest war photography,"
00:39:52,00:39:54,"or some of the earliest war photography,"
00:39:54,00:39:58,very famous photo of the Valley of the Shadow of Death
00:39:58,00:40:00,by Roger Fenton in 1855.
00:40:00,00:40:02,I think it's one of the earliest pictures of warfare.
00:40:02,00:40:03,"Basically, there are two photos"
00:40:03,00:40:05,of the Valley of the Shadow of Death.
00:40:05,00:40:08,"And they're both of this extremely barren landscape,"
00:40:08,00:40:10,"very near where the Charger Library was,"
00:40:10,00:40:14,"and gravel, little valley slopes on each side."
00:40:14,00:40:16,"One of them has some cannonballs on the floor,"
00:40:16,00:40:17,"one of them doesn't,"
00:40:17,00:40:19,and the famous one is the one with the cannonballs.
00:40:19,00:40:22,"And it's the, you know, sort of tragedy of war"
00:40:22,00:40:25,and the emptiness of the landscape with these war weapons.
00:40:25,00:40:28,But there's been so much debate over the last 150 years
00:40:28,00:40:30,over whether he faked it.
00:40:30,00:40:31,"Like, where did the cannonballs come from?"
00:40:31,00:40:34,"- Well, Sax, I think, prototypes."
00:40:34,00:40:36,(all laughing)
00:40:36,00:40:37,"- His marbles, weren't they?"
00:40:37,00:40:40,(all laughing)
00:40:40,00:40:41,"And we don't know, 'cause it might be"
00:40:41,00:40:43,that the second photo is after they'd cleared it up.
00:40:43,00:40:45,So then they just took another one of it clean.
00:40:45,00:40:46,"- Right, or he might have deposited."
00:40:46,00:40:47,"Ooh, tricky."
00:40:47,00:40:49,"- The thing was, 'cause he took a lot of photos, right?"
00:40:49,00:40:51,"He had a horse and carriage with him,"
00:40:51,00:40:54,which was like a portable photo developing booth
00:40:54,00:40:55,that he had with him.
00:40:55,00:40:58,He had lots of glass slides that he had
00:40:58,00:40:59,"with him, multiple cameras."
00:40:59,00:41:01,"And everyone's saying, oh, he staged a lot of photos."
00:41:01,00:41:04,I think it's more than just the cannonball one.
00:41:04,00:41:07,"And the problem is, of course, they were staged."
00:41:07,00:41:09,Everything had to be staged.
00:41:09,00:41:10,- 'Cause you needed a long exposure time.
00:41:10,00:41:12,- The exposure was like 30 seconds.
00:41:12,00:41:14,- It's actually why the charge of the labricade
00:41:14,00:41:15,"was such a disastrous, 'cause they had to wait"
00:41:15,00:41:17,for half a minute for the photo.
00:41:17,00:41:19,The team photo at the start.
00:41:19,00:41:20,- And someone was blinking.
00:41:20,00:41:22,(all laughing)
00:41:22,00:41:24,(upbeat music)
00:41:24,00:41:29,"- Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show,"
00:41:29,00:41:31,and that is Andy.
00:41:31,00:41:34,"- My fact is, there is a chameleon in Madagascar,"
00:41:34,00:41:38,which is effectively extinct for several months every year.
00:41:39,00:41:41,This fact is incredible.
00:41:41,00:41:41,- It's insane.
00:41:41,00:41:42,"- Yeah, it's really good."
00:41:42,00:41:43,- I think it's not true.
00:41:43,00:41:46,"I think if you're extinct, come back three months later,"
00:41:46,00:41:47,you're not extinct.
00:41:47,00:41:48,- Let's debate the case.
00:41:48,00:41:49,(all laughing)
00:41:49,00:41:51,"And first of all, thanks to Kate Wood,"
00:41:51,00:41:54,"who sent us in, in the email, ""the fish in the box."""
00:41:54,00:41:56,"- If I knew it was from you, as opposed to Andy,"
00:41:56,00:41:57,I wouldn't have poo pooed it.
00:41:57,00:41:58,"- No, no, no."
00:41:58,00:42:02,"This is the Labord's chameleon, and it is crazy."
00:42:02,00:42:05,"Right, so, November, the chameleon hatches out."
00:42:05,00:42:06,- Yes.
00:42:06,00:42:09,"- In Madagascar, in the forest."
00:42:09,00:42:11,Then they grow to sexual maturity very fast.
00:42:11,00:42:15,"In about two months, they are grown up, ready to breed."
00:42:15,00:42:18,"They breed, the females lay some eggs in the ground."
00:42:18,00:42:20,"Then in March, they all die."
00:42:20,00:42:21,"- Not the eggs, the adults."
00:42:21,00:42:23,- All the adults die.
00:42:23,00:42:26,"There are then, the entire species exists in egg form,"
00:42:26,00:42:28,"basically, for most of the year."
00:42:28,00:42:30,"In November, eggs hatch out, on they go."
00:42:30,00:42:34,"- It's so weird, it's so weird, for most of the year,"
00:42:34,00:42:35,"yeah, they're not extinct exactly,"
00:42:35,00:42:37,"but for most of the year, the species lives in,"
00:42:37,00:42:38,as an egg.
00:42:38,00:42:41,- Must be weird for the first person to come out of the egg.
00:42:41,00:42:42,- Yeah.
00:42:42,00:42:42,- Every year.
00:42:42,00:42:43,"- Oh my God, yeah."
00:42:43,00:42:45,- They learn nothing from their elders?
00:42:45,00:42:46,I just think these are bizarre.
00:42:46,00:42:48,These were discovered in 2008.
00:42:48,00:42:50,I think their life cycle was first reported.
00:42:50,00:42:51,"I think since then, they have found that"
00:42:51,00:42:53,"if you keep some in captivity,"
00:42:53,00:42:55,"or maybe under very specific conditions,"
00:42:55,00:42:57,one might make it through a year.
00:42:57,00:42:58,"But it's really, really rare."
00:42:58,00:42:59,So it's--
00:42:59,00:43:00,- What a year 2008 was.
00:43:00,00:43:03,"Over in India, you had someone being killed on TV"
00:43:03,00:43:05,"with mind power, or not, or not."
00:43:05,00:43:06,- In Iraq.
00:43:06,00:43:08,"- You had a chameleon being extinct, or not."
00:43:08,00:43:11,"- In Iraq, George Bush is getting a tooth run at him."
00:43:11,00:43:12,- Wow.
00:43:12,00:43:12,- What?
00:43:12,00:43:14,- What was Anthony Trollup doing that year?
00:43:14,00:43:16,(all laughing)
00:43:16,00:43:17,"- No, and they're amazing."
00:43:17,00:43:20,"And I think it's 'cause they die to avoid the dry season,"
00:43:20,00:43:23,"which is very harsh and very, very hot in Madagascar."
00:43:23,00:43:26,"And they just, some species hibernate,"
00:43:26,00:43:27,they just decide to die.
00:43:27,00:43:29,"And lots of chameleons on Madagascar,"
00:43:29,00:43:31,I think they've got about--
00:43:31,00:43:32,"- They've got almost half, haven't they?"
00:43:32,00:43:34,"- Almost half, what's the percentage of something?"
00:43:34,00:43:35,- Yeah.
00:43:35,00:43:36,- Extraordinary variety of estimates
00:43:36,00:43:38,as to the number of chameleon species.
00:43:38,00:43:40,"Given that it feels like a very small, countable number,"
00:43:40,00:43:43,"I read anywhere, and all from very reputable sources,"
00:43:43,00:43:48,anywhere between 134 and more than 217 species of chameleon.
00:43:48,00:43:49,"- Well, they're different colors, aren't they?"
00:43:49,00:43:50,"It's very hard to tell, you know?"
00:43:50,00:43:50,"- Yeah, yeah, that's a good point."
00:43:50,00:43:52,"- Well, this was a green one before."
00:43:52,00:43:53,(all laughing)
00:43:53,00:43:55,Or is it a different one?
00:43:55,00:43:56,- They're great.
00:43:56,00:43:57,"- Yeah, they don't change their color to match their background."
00:43:57,00:43:58,I actually didn't know that
00:43:58,00:44:01,until reading it for this podcast.
00:44:01,00:44:01,- Right.
00:44:01,00:44:02,- They change their emotions.
00:44:02,00:44:04,"- Yeah, no, I think that's amazing."
00:44:04,00:44:06,An amazing misconception.
00:44:06,00:44:08,It's one of the biggest ones we've debunked on QI.
00:44:08,00:44:10,"You know, sometimes we debunk things that you think,"
00:44:10,00:44:12,"yeah, come on, that's a bit."
00:44:12,00:44:13,"- No, we never do that."
00:44:13,00:44:15,"- No, we never do that, we never do that."
00:44:15,00:44:16,- There's an amazing thing.
00:44:16,00:44:20,"If you were watching the UFC of chameleon battles, right?"
00:44:20,00:44:22,Two competitors enter the ring.
00:44:22,00:44:25,"If you were betting, you could probably bet"
00:44:25,00:44:27,"in the last few seconds, if that was allowed,"
00:44:27,00:44:29,on who was gonna win.
00:44:29,00:44:31,- Do they change color based on whether they think
00:44:31,00:44:32,they're gonna win or lose?
00:44:32,00:44:33,"- When they pass each other in the street,"
00:44:33,00:44:37,"two males were often changed colors to sort of be like,"
00:44:37,00:44:39,kind of like if you're walking poolside
00:44:39,00:44:42,and you tuck your tummy in and walk in that kind of thing.
00:44:42,00:44:46,"So yeah, so they found when they were studying it"
00:44:46,00:44:48,that the chameleon that was brighter
00:44:48,00:44:52,and changed more rapidly was the one who was gonna win.
00:44:52,00:44:54,And they just found that that on average
00:44:54,00:44:55,was the way that it happened.
00:44:55,00:44:56,"Yeah, or above average."
00:44:56,00:44:58,"- So what a useful way, if only we could tell them that,"
00:44:58,00:45:00,"then they never have to fight, right?"
00:45:00,00:45:01,- They can always just go up to each other and go.
00:45:01,00:45:02,- Stop the match.
00:45:02,00:45:02,"- Oh, okay."
00:45:02,00:45:04,"- Throw the towel in, yeah."
00:45:04,00:45:05,- Exactly.
00:45:05,00:45:05,- Wow.
00:45:05,00:45:08,"- If you were a chameleon in a boxing ring or something,"
00:45:08,00:45:09,"'cause you normally wear a little dressing gown,"
00:45:09,00:45:10,"don't you, into the ring."
00:45:10,00:45:12,"And as soon as you take your dressing gown off,"
00:45:12,00:45:13,"you look down, you were confident"
00:45:13,00:45:16,until you saw how bright and stripy the other guy is.
00:45:16,00:45:17,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:45:17,00:45:19,"- I should just quickly say, this was in 2013,"
00:45:19,00:45:21,"it was a guy called Russell Ligon and Kevin McGrew,"
00:45:21,00:45:23,and they did 45 encounters that they monitored.
00:45:23,00:45:25,And that's what they discovered from it.
00:45:25,00:45:26,- That's very cool.
00:45:26,00:45:26,- Yeah.
00:45:26,00:45:28,- They've got amazing anatomy.
00:45:28,00:45:31,I didn't know about the shape of their feet at all.
00:45:31,00:45:32,And they are bizarre.
00:45:32,00:45:34,They are described often as looking like salad tongs.
00:45:34,00:45:35,"- Oh, yeah."
00:45:35,00:45:36,- And they do.
00:45:36,00:45:39,So there are two pads opposite each other.
00:45:39,00:45:44,"And in fact, they're the only animals who aren't birds,"
00:45:44,00:45:47,"who are zygodactylists,"
00:45:47,00:45:50,"which basically means that they have three fingers,"
00:45:50,00:45:52,opposite two fingers in a certain way.
00:45:52,00:45:54,"And they're not the same kind of zygodactylists,"
00:45:54,00:45:55,"really, as birds."
00:45:55,00:45:57,They're their own special thing.
00:45:57,00:45:58,And essentially it's to grip trees.
00:45:58,00:46:00,I don't know why more things don't have this.
00:46:00,00:46:02,So it looks like a sideways claw
00:46:02,00:46:04,that just clamps onto trees.
00:46:04,00:46:05,It's very clever.
00:46:05,00:46:07,But I did find out that you can also get
00:46:07,00:46:12,"pamperodactyly, anisodactyly, and schizo-dactylies as well,"
00:46:12,00:46:15,"which are in primate schizo-dactylies,"
00:46:15,00:46:18,grasped with their second and third digits.
00:46:18,00:46:19,What's we're doing instead of thumb and finger?
00:46:19,00:46:22,- Like doing scissors for a rock paper scissors.
00:46:22,00:46:23,- Exactly.
00:46:23,00:46:26,"- Does that free you up to hold something, like food?"
00:46:26,00:46:28,- Or do you like a thumbs up at the same time
00:46:28,00:46:29,as holding onto the tree?
00:46:29,00:46:31,"- I think that's the idea, yeah."
00:46:31,00:46:32,- And you can hold a can of paper
00:46:32,00:46:33,between fingers four and five.
00:46:33,00:46:34,"- Yeah, perfect."
00:46:34,00:46:36,"- No, they are, they're great."
00:46:36,00:46:38,I know someone who's got a peck of media.
00:46:38,00:46:39,- Do you?
00:46:39,00:46:40,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:46:40,00:46:42,- Is that the end of the Alec Dope?
00:46:42,00:46:44,- I think it is.
00:46:44,00:46:47,"- I'm rummaging for more, but that really is about it."
00:46:47,00:46:48,It's called Roy.
00:46:48,00:46:50,"- Oh, there was more, there was more."
00:46:50,00:46:54,"- No, and that's the end of the Alec Dope, yeah."
00:46:54,00:46:56,- If you were sitting on a chameleon's tongue
00:46:56,00:46:58,when it ate something.
00:46:58,00:46:59,"- Food for thought, yeah."
00:46:59,00:47:02,- You would die so badly.
00:47:02,00:47:04,"- No, no, it would just not be able to eat anything"
00:47:04,00:47:06,because you're way bigger than a chameleon.
00:47:06,00:47:08,"If you're sitting on its tongue,"
00:47:08,00:47:10,it's not gonna be eating anything.
00:47:10,00:47:11,"- Sorry, you're right."
00:47:11,00:47:13,You have to imagine that you're the size of a borrower
00:47:13,00:47:14,or maybe even smaller.
00:47:14,00:47:15,"- Oh, okay."
00:47:15,00:47:15,- Of an ant.
00:47:15,00:47:16,"Oh yeah, sorry."
00:47:16,00:47:18,"Well, we'll see if you sit on a chameleon's tongue,"
00:47:18,00:47:20,it'll just crush its tongue because you're human size.
00:47:20,00:47:22,"- No, but like, you know, if something bites you,"
00:47:22,00:47:23,a bite could have venom
00:47:23,00:47:24,and I thought the reveal was gonna be the tongue would.
00:47:24,00:47:25,"- Sorry, it wasn't."
00:47:25,00:47:27,It was the acceleration of their tongues.
00:47:27,00:47:28,I should have made clear that you've been shrunken
00:47:28,00:47:30,like honey eye shots with kids in this.
00:47:30,00:47:32,"- Yeah, I think that was a big central bit of that story."
00:47:32,00:47:32,- It was.
00:47:32,00:47:34,"- Yeah, Anna, you've clasped at this one."
00:47:34,00:47:34,This is it.
00:47:34,00:47:35,(laughing)
00:47:35,00:47:37,- Should I?
00:47:37,00:47:39,"If you were really, really small"
00:47:39,00:47:41,and you were sitting on a chameleon's tongue
00:47:41,00:47:43,"and it stuck it out, then you would definitely die."
00:47:43,00:47:45,The acceleration of their tongues are amazing.
00:47:45,00:47:47,They're actually the highest acceleration
00:47:47,00:47:50,"and power output, like amount of power generated"
00:47:50,00:47:53,"for any movement of a reptile, bird, or mammal."
00:47:53,00:47:54,- It is the same.
00:47:54,00:47:55,- Yeah.
00:47:55,00:47:58,"- The power output is 14,000 watts per kilogram."
00:47:58,00:47:58,- Incredible.
00:47:58,00:48:02,"- Okay, now, Jonas Fingard or Tade Pagaccia"
00:48:02,00:48:05,who are the best cyclists in the world in the Tour de France
00:48:05,00:48:07,"say if they're going up a mountain,"
00:48:07,00:48:11,they can max out at about seven watts per kilogram
00:48:11,00:48:14,"and these guys are doing 14,000 watts per kilogram."
00:48:14,00:48:15,- It's a lot.
00:48:15,00:48:17,- I almost can't compute that.
00:48:17,00:48:18,That's amazing.
00:48:18,00:48:21,"- It's like, so the G-force is, I think,"
00:48:21,00:48:22,the maximum G-force we can survive
00:48:22,00:48:25,is maybe nine or 10 for a few seconds by the pilots
00:48:25,00:48:28,and the G-force on their tongue would be 264 G.
00:48:28,00:48:29,- Okay.
00:48:29,00:48:30,(laughing)
00:48:30,00:48:32,- Your face is being distorted by that.
00:48:32,00:48:34,- That is so cool.
00:48:34,00:48:37,I did read a bit about what's inside their tongue
00:48:37,00:48:38,'cause they have these things called
00:48:38,00:48:41,"intralingual sheaths, right?"
00:48:41,00:48:43,"So the tongue has bones running along the core of it,"
00:48:43,00:48:44,which is weird in itself.
00:48:44,00:48:46,"I guess they don't, not very big bones,"
00:48:46,00:48:48,but those are covered by these intralingual sheaths
00:48:48,00:48:51,and those are covered by an accelerator muscle
00:48:51,00:48:52,and what the chameleon does is
00:48:52,00:48:54,the chameleon spring loads the sheaths
00:48:54,00:48:57,and packs them into each other like a telescope.
00:48:57,00:48:58,"- That's like, there was a toy that used to do that"
00:48:58,00:49:00,that you flicked it when you were younger
00:49:00,00:49:03,"and it was telescopic and they expanded out, wasn't there?"
00:49:03,00:49:04,I've got a real memory of that.
00:49:04,00:49:05,- I don't remember that.
00:49:05,00:49:07,- I was just playing with the chameleon's tongue
00:49:07,00:49:07,when I was younger.
00:49:07,00:49:10,- You would get like those pointers that teachers had
00:49:10,00:49:11,"and they would go like that, wouldn't they?"
00:49:11,00:49:12,- Yes.
00:49:12,00:49:14,- I got one of those last year.
00:49:14,00:49:14,- For Christmas.
00:49:14,00:49:17,- I got one myself at a non-holiday time
00:49:17,00:49:19,"and God, they're good."
00:49:19,00:49:20,- Yeah.
00:49:20,00:49:21,- The pointers.
00:49:21,00:49:23,- Do you just point at stuff?
00:49:23,00:49:24,- Yeah.
00:49:24,00:49:26,"- Just walk down the street going, there's a fancy tree."
00:49:26,00:49:30,"- It really, it gives you a kind of authority"
00:49:30,00:49:33,"that is extraordinary, you know."
00:49:33,00:49:34,- You've never dared use it here.
00:49:34,00:49:36,"- No, no, no, but if I'm in the supermarket"
00:49:36,00:49:38,and I want to put it something on the conveyor belt
00:49:38,00:49:42,"and say, make sure you apply the discount on that radish,"
00:49:42,00:49:42,my good man.
00:49:42,00:49:44,- I'm gonna bleep this one next.
00:49:44,00:49:48,- I'm so confused about why you asked people what it is.
00:49:48,00:49:52,- I'm so confused because all of this sounds so plausible.
00:49:52,00:49:53,- Yeah.
00:49:53,00:49:54,- We're just missing the one detail.
00:49:54,00:49:57,"- We're sort of playing what I like you now, aren't we?"
00:49:57,00:49:59,"No, I think it was a couple of years ago."
00:49:59,00:50:00,I bought it for a show.
00:50:00,00:50:02,But I cannot remember the context in which I have
00:50:02,00:50:03,"and I've just ended up with a pointer,"
00:50:03,00:50:04,which I'd love to get out occasionally.
00:50:04,00:50:05,- That's right.
00:50:05,00:50:07,- So chameleon saliva.
00:50:07,00:50:09,This was another fact in the inbox actually.
00:50:09,00:50:11,"So not only did Kate Wood send the original fact,"
00:50:11,00:50:12,"that Robert Harding writes,"
00:50:12,00:50:15,chameleon saliva is the opposite of custard.
00:50:15,00:50:18,- It's disgusting on treacle time.
00:50:18,00:50:22,"Is that 'cause it's non-Newtonian, but in a different way?"
00:50:22,00:50:23,- Bingo.
00:50:23,00:50:24,- Yes.
00:50:24,00:50:26,"- So custard, if you run across custard,"
00:50:26,00:50:29,"as you apply force to it, it gets harder."
00:50:29,00:50:30,- Very good.
00:50:30,00:50:33,"That's it, it thickens on impact."
00:50:33,00:50:36,"A chameleon saliva is thick in the mouth,"
00:50:36,00:50:38,but when the tongue strikes the insect
00:50:38,00:50:40,"it's trying to eat or whatever,"
00:50:40,00:50:43,that blob becomes very malleable for an instant.
00:50:43,00:50:44,- That's clever.
00:50:44,00:50:45,- And then hardens right again.
00:50:45,00:50:46,- Right.
00:50:46,00:50:48,- So the prey is then glued to the tongue
00:50:48,00:50:51,and then it gets pulled right back into the chameleon's mouth.
00:50:51,00:50:52,- That's clever.
00:50:52,00:50:53,- Isn't that amazing?
00:50:53,00:50:54,- I found a chameleon who was a chameleon
00:50:54,00:50:56,before chameleons were chameleons.
00:50:56,00:50:57,- What?
00:50:57,00:50:58,- Keep talking.
00:50:58,00:50:59,- Keep talking.
00:50:59,00:51:00,- I got a headache.
00:51:00,00:51:02,You know I got a headache and this is not helping.
00:51:02,00:51:04,- There used to be a philosopher called chameleon.
00:51:04,00:51:05,- Really?
00:51:05,00:51:06,- He was a disciple of Aristotle.
00:51:06,00:51:09,- Was he the guy who came up with the idea of karma?
00:51:10,00:51:13,(laughing)
00:51:13,00:51:15,"- He, we don't know anything about him."
00:51:15,00:51:16,- He's just gonna go straight up.
00:51:16,00:51:18,"- I'm just, you're ill, you don't know what you're saying."
00:51:18,00:51:22,It's just helping you out here.
00:51:22,00:51:24,"Yeah, no, he is a disciple."
00:51:24,00:51:25,"We know virtually nothing about him,"
00:51:25,00:51:27,"I guess with us, as with a lot of people then,"
00:51:27,00:51:29,but he did write a lot of pieces
00:51:29,00:51:31,"that we do know of his names attached to,"
00:51:31,00:51:33,"like a piece called ""On Drunkenness"","
00:51:33,00:51:35,"a piece called ""On Pleasure"","
00:51:35,00:51:36,but virtually nothing is known.
00:51:36,00:51:41,"But so he lived, he would have died in 281 BC"
00:51:41,00:51:43,and the word chameleon came about
00:51:43,00:51:46,"in roughly the 14th century, mid-14th century."
00:51:46,00:51:48,"- Okay, interesting."
00:51:48,00:51:49,"- To describe the lizard, presumably."
00:51:49,00:51:50,"- To describe the lizard and what's interesting is,"
00:51:50,00:51:52,"Aristotle wrote about chameleons,"
00:51:52,00:51:53,but we just didn't have the word
00:51:53,00:51:55,and he wasn't writing about his mate.
00:51:55,00:51:56,"- So did he always have to say,"
00:51:56,00:51:58,"""You know that thing that kind of changes color,"
00:51:58,00:52:00,"""looks a bit like a gecko?"""
00:52:00,00:52:03,"- Looks like my mate, my disciples, yeah."
00:52:03,00:52:05,- Can I give you some animals
00:52:05,00:52:06,"that were thought to be extinct,"
00:52:06,00:52:07,but then aren't.
00:52:07,00:52:08,- Yes.
00:52:08,00:52:10,"- The Canterbury, Nobdweevil."
00:52:10,00:52:11,- Okay.
00:52:11,00:52:13,(laughing)
00:52:13,00:52:15,- I might just stop there actually.
00:52:15,00:52:16,"- No, more, more!"
00:52:16,00:52:18,"- The cloaked bee, the dinosaur ant,"
00:52:18,00:52:21,"the terrace skink, the Batman river loach,"
00:52:21,00:52:24,"the painted frog, and the Machu Picchu,"
00:52:24,00:52:26,"arboreal chinchilla rat,"
00:52:26,00:52:29,which was found in a tree near Machu Picchu.
00:52:29,00:52:30,- Right.
00:52:30,00:52:31,- When they un-extincted it.
00:52:31,00:52:32,- Wow.
00:52:32,00:52:33,"- So these are just all things,"
00:52:33,00:52:36,"was there one big find, one day out,"
00:52:36,00:52:37,where they're just all hanging out
00:52:37,00:52:40,in the same playing cards for a while?
00:52:40,00:52:41,- It's some sort of like support group
00:52:41,00:52:45,"for the extinct who aren't extinct, yeah."
00:52:45,00:52:47,- There's also the Confusing Rocket Frog.
00:52:47,00:52:48,- That's a great name.
00:52:48,00:52:51,"- And they found it in 2019,"
00:52:51,00:52:53,and it's called Confusing because it looks a lot
00:52:53,00:52:56,"like other frogs, but it's the Confusing Rocket Frog."
00:52:56,00:52:57,"And the interesting thing about this is,"
00:52:57,00:53:00,it was thought to be extinct in 1985.
00:53:00,00:53:02,"They found it in 2019, but luckily it was in a place"
00:53:02,00:53:04,where they were about to do loads of mining
00:53:04,00:53:06,"and logging and stuff like that,"
00:53:06,00:53:08,and it meant that they couldn't do any of it.
00:53:08,00:53:08,- Brilliant.
00:53:08,00:53:09,- I think it's in Ecuador.
00:53:09,00:53:10,- That's great.
00:53:10,00:53:11,"- Well done, Little Rocket Frog."
00:53:11,00:53:13,"- The Painted Frog, was that one that you said?"
00:53:13,00:53:14,"- Painted Frog, yeah."
00:53:14,00:53:16,- Which just sounds like someone forcing
00:53:16,00:53:18,chameleonism onto animals.
00:53:18,00:53:19,(all laughing)
00:53:19,00:53:20,- That's very interesting.
00:53:20,00:53:22,- There's a type of fish that was thought
00:53:22,00:53:25,"to have gone extinct 66 million years ago,"
00:53:25,00:53:27,and then it was found in 1938.
00:53:27,00:53:29,And it's the Sealocanth.
00:53:29,00:53:32,And do you know the story of how it was rediscovered?
00:53:32,00:53:33,- Is it?
00:53:33,00:53:34,- It's so cool.
00:53:34,00:53:34,- Was it in 1938?
00:53:34,00:53:36,Was it found by a submarine?
00:53:36,00:53:40,"- No, no, just found by a normal fisherman in South Africa,"
00:53:40,00:53:42,"caught a weird fish, got back,"
00:53:42,00:53:44,"gave it to this woman who ran the museum,"
00:53:44,00:53:46,who thought that's weird.
00:53:46,00:53:47,So she sketched it.
00:53:47,00:53:48,"- Oh, I remember, yay."
00:53:48,00:53:50,"- It's amazing, so she sketched it,"
00:53:50,00:53:52,"and she sent it to Professor Smith,"
00:53:52,00:53:54,who she knew would be able to tell her what it was.
00:53:54,00:53:57,"Professor Smith received her sketch, no straight away."
00:53:57,00:53:58,This is the Sealocanth.
00:53:58,00:54:00,"It's been 66 million years, we thought it was gone."
00:54:00,00:54:03,"And he goes and he visits it,"
00:54:03,00:54:05,but it's kind of disintegrated by that point.
00:54:05,00:54:07,"So he can't confirm really that lots about it,"
00:54:07,00:54:08,or where it came from.
00:54:08,00:54:11,And he devoted the next 14 years
00:54:11,00:54:14,to finding a second specimen.
00:54:14,00:54:15,He was desperate.
00:54:15,00:54:18,"And eventually there was a guy on the,"
00:54:18,00:54:21,"one of the Comoros Islands off Mozambique in 1952,"
00:54:21,00:54:22,who found one.
00:54:22,00:54:26,And Smith was managed to convince the South African government
00:54:26,00:54:28,to get a military plane to fly him
00:54:28,00:54:30,to off the coast of Mozambique.
00:54:30,00:54:33,"He had to have a conversation with the Mozambique authorities,"
00:54:33,00:54:34,"saying, ""Hey, we're flying military planes"
00:54:34,00:54:36,"""over your airspace, really sorry."""
00:54:36,00:54:38,"They were like, ""Why are you doing that?"""
00:54:38,00:54:40,"They said, ""We're just going to pick up a fish."""
00:54:40,00:54:41,"- I remember reading that story,"
00:54:41,00:54:44,and I think the woman who found it in the first place
00:54:44,00:54:46,"and knew there was something up,"
00:54:46,00:54:49,I think it was either Smith or someone else said
00:54:49,00:54:51,it was evidence of women's intuition.
00:54:51,00:54:53,The greatest evidence we ever had of women's intuition.
00:54:53,00:54:54,- Really?
00:54:54,00:54:55,"Marjorie Courtney Lassmer, really?"
00:54:55,00:54:57,"- That's what I said, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:54:57,00:54:58,"- What, just 'cause she sensed that this is a weird..."
00:54:58,00:55:00,- She just knew there was something going on.
00:55:00,00:55:02,- Yeah. - Wow.
00:55:02,00:55:03,"- Just proving two things with one fish,"
00:55:03,00:55:05,that's pretty cool.
00:55:05,00:55:06,"Not only do we have the fish,"
00:55:06,00:55:08,we now know about women's intuition.
00:55:08,00:55:09,(all laughing)
00:55:09,00:55:11,- Happy day for the world.
00:55:11,00:55:15,"- I'd love it if his paper, which eventually came out,"
00:55:15,00:55:17,"was about women's intuition, not about the fish."
00:55:17,00:55:19,(all laughing)
00:55:19,00:55:22,(upbeat music)
00:55:22,00:55:25,"- Okay, that's it."
00:55:25,00:55:26,That is all of our facts.
00:55:26,00:55:27,Thank you so much for listening.
