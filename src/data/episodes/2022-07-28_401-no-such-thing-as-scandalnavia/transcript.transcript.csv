00:00:14,00:00:19,">> Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish,"
00:00:19,00:00:24,a weekly podcast this week coming to you live from Ipswich.
00:00:24,00:00:28,>> [APPLAUSE]
00:00:28,00:00:30,>> My name is Dan Schreiber.
00:00:30,00:00:35,"I am sitting here with Anna Tyshinski, Andrew Hunter Murray, and James Harkin."
00:00:35,00:00:38,"And once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite"
00:00:38,00:00:40,facts from the last seven days.
00:00:40,00:00:43,"And in no particular order, here we go."
00:00:43,00:00:46,"Starting with fact number one, and that is my fact."
00:00:46,00:00:52,My fact this week is that there's a special piano that only Benny from
00:00:52,00:00:58,Abba can play and he can only play it if he's six miles away from it.
00:00:58,00:00:59,>> [LAUGH]
00:00:59,00:01:01,>> This is such a cool thing.
00:01:01,00:01:05,"There's an Abba Museum in Stockholm, which is a fascinating place."
00:01:05,00:01:08,And in it is a piano that belongs to Benny.
00:01:08,00:01:13,And what they've done is they've synced up the piano with Benny's studio.
00:01:13,00:01:17,"And so anytime Benny's at home and he plays on it,"
00:01:17,00:01:22,the piano in the museum just starts playing whatever it is that he's playing as well.
00:01:22,00:01:25,>> So what if I go to Benny's house and I'm not very good at playing the piano and
00:01:25,00:01:27,"I just play chopsticks, will that play on there as well?"
00:01:27,00:01:30,">> Well, I think it'll probably summon an ambulance to Benny's house."
00:01:30,00:01:33,>> [LAUGH]
00:01:33,00:01:34,>> Send it out on SOS.
00:01:34,00:01:36,>> [LAUGH]
00:01:36,00:01:40,">> It's what I'm saying, it's hooked up to an iPad."
00:01:40,00:01:41,So it's not everything that plays.
00:01:41,00:01:46,He has to decide when he's allowing the museum to hear what he's hearing.
00:01:46,00:01:47,">> Got it, yeah."
00:01:47,00:01:51,">> They also, they have a phone where only four people have the number of the phone."
00:01:51,00:01:52,>> Who are they?
00:01:52,00:01:53,>> Is it us four?
00:01:53,00:01:54,>> It's us four.
00:01:54,00:01:56,">> No, it's Abba."
00:01:56,00:01:59,">> And if the phone rings in the museum,"
00:01:59,00:02:03,then you know that it's one of the four members of Abba phoning that phone.
00:02:03,00:02:06,">> And they got the idea from Yoko Ono, didn't they?"
00:02:06,00:02:06,>> Did they?
00:02:06,00:02:09,">> Yeah, so Yoko Ono has got quite a few of these,"
00:02:09,00:02:13,what she calls telephone pieces that's been in various different exhibitions
00:02:13,00:02:16,around the world over the last few years.
00:02:16,00:02:18,"She did one in Argentina, she did one in New York."
00:02:18,00:02:22,And her idea is that she will ring it from time to time and someone will answer.
00:02:22,00:02:26,"And when they answer, they're completing the piece, the artwork."
00:02:26,00:02:27,Do you think about it that way?
00:02:27,00:02:27,">> Yeah, yeah."
00:02:27,00:02:32,">> So the first time someone did that, they were in a Toronto exhibition in 2002."
00:02:32,00:02:36,"And the phone rang and the guy said, hello?"
00:02:36,00:02:39,"And Yoko Ono said, are you in China?"
00:02:39,00:02:43,"And he said, no, I'm in Toronto, Canada, where the exhibition is."
00:02:43,00:02:45,"And she said, oh, I'm not in China either."
00:02:45,00:02:47,And she hung up.
00:02:47,00:02:48,>> Wow. >> Nice.
00:02:48,00:02:53,>> Did he then get paid half the money that she'd made from selling this exhibition?
00:02:53,00:02:54,That'd be amazing.
00:02:54,00:02:57,">> Wow, Abba."
00:02:57,00:02:58,>> Yeah.
00:02:58,00:03:00,>> They were pretty unpopular in Sweden.
00:03:00,00:03:01,">> No, they weren't."
00:03:01,00:03:02,They were very popular.
00:03:02,00:03:06,">> In Sweden, right at the start of their careers, they were seen as being,"
00:03:06,00:03:07,I can't believe this is true.
00:03:07,00:03:11,"But they became really famous in, what was it, 1974, the Eurovision?"
00:03:11,00:03:12,When they sang Mortalin?
00:03:12,00:03:13,>> Yeah.
00:03:13,00:03:17,">> Apparently, when they became really popular in the world,"
00:03:17,00:03:21,Sweden was so snotty about them that they cancelled the Swedish top of the pops
00:03:21,00:03:23,and abolished the pop charts.
00:03:23,00:03:23,>> What?
00:03:23,00:03:26,">> Come on, no way."
00:03:26,00:03:27,">> Yeah, that's what I read."
00:03:27,00:03:28,>> Yeah.
00:03:28,00:03:28,>> Why?
00:03:28,00:03:29,Because they thought that-
00:03:29,00:03:30,>> Just they were a bit-
00:03:30,00:03:31,>> Have you gone to commercial?
00:03:31,00:03:33,">> They were a bit commercial, they were a bit poppy."
00:03:33,00:03:36,"They were, I mean, they had an incredible and different sound, but they were also very,"
00:03:36,00:03:37,"yeah, commercial."
00:03:37,00:03:40,>> But they were weirdly like a super group because both Benny and
00:03:40,00:03:45,Bjorn had very big bands that they were in before Abba came along.
00:03:45,00:03:49,"And then they got married to Agnatha and Annie Fridt, who both were big singers."
00:03:49,00:03:51,And it didn't work.
00:03:51,00:03:53,And one theory by one of the people who worked with them is
00:03:53,00:03:56,because they had a terrible band name before they came up with Abba.
00:03:56,00:04:01,"So their original band name was Bjorn and Benny, Agnatha and Annie Fridt."
00:04:01,00:04:01,That was their name.
00:04:01,00:04:03,>> [LAUGH]
00:04:03,00:04:06,>> And then they became Abba because that was the shorthand that was used for it.
00:04:06,00:04:08,>> It was a newspaper competition that got the name.
00:04:08,00:04:08,>> Was it?
00:04:08,00:04:10,">> Yeah, yeah, they had because they'd had other names,"
00:04:10,00:04:13,which included Alibaba and Fab and Baba.
00:04:13,00:04:16,And then there was a Gothenburg newspaper held a competition.
00:04:16,00:04:19,So we've got to get this band a better name because these all stink.
00:04:19,00:04:21,And Abba was the winning.
00:04:21,00:04:24,>> I read that they borrowed the name from a fish company.
00:04:24,00:04:26,And that was on the website of the fish company.
00:04:26,00:04:27,>> [LAUGH]
00:04:27,00:04:31,>> They said that we agreed to lend our name to the pop group.
00:04:31,00:04:33,>> I was thinking they're going to give it back at some point.
00:04:33,00:04:38,">> It does, because it's a big fish company, everyone knows Abba fish company."
00:04:38,00:04:41,And so I can see that it would have been controversial.
00:04:41,00:04:43,They did have a weird time.
00:04:43,00:04:46,The two couples that was made up of the two married couples got divorced within
00:04:46,00:04:50,basically two years of each other between 1980 and 1982.
00:04:50,00:04:52,While writing their best song.
00:04:52,00:04:56,"So if you listen to The Winner Takes It All, that was written by Bjorn, wasn't it?"
00:04:56,00:05:00,"And then he got Agnetha to sing it, and they'd been married."
00:05:00,00:05:04,"And she says, it's very interesting reading what they say about the divorce."
00:05:04,00:05:08,"Because he says, God, it was the friendliest divorce on the face of the earth."
00:05:08,00:05:10,No marriage break up could have been easier.
00:05:10,00:05:12,Best friends forever.
00:05:12,00:05:14,"And then you read her on a separate interview going, everyone thought it was"
00:05:14,00:05:16,"a really easy time, but it was actually hell."
00:05:16,00:05:21,">> And particularly being made to sing the lyrics of this song, which are things like,"
00:05:21,00:05:24,talking about does she kiss you like I used to kiss you.
00:05:24,00:05:28,And he'd gone off with another girlfriend weeks after they divorced.
00:05:28,00:05:30,She's there on stage singing it.
00:05:30,00:05:31,So yeah. >> That's awkward.
00:05:31,00:05:35,And then it was 1981 when the final divorce went through.
00:05:35,00:05:38,"And so by 1982, they were all single."
00:05:38,00:05:41,And their first album of 1982 was called The Singles.
00:05:41,00:05:46,">> Yes. >> That's good, that's so good."
00:05:46,00:05:49,"And do you know there are, just on that note, there are Abbotributax,"
00:05:49,00:05:53,which include the beyond identity and the beyond ultimatum.
00:05:53,00:05:55,But not the beyond supremacy.
00:05:55,00:05:58,>> [LAUGH]
00:05:58,00:05:58,>> Very funny.
00:05:58,00:06:00,>> That's so good.
00:06:00,00:06:03,">> And if you're not Swedish, Scandal."
00:06:03,00:06:03,>> Really?
00:06:03,00:06:05,">> Norwegian, bullshit."
00:06:05,00:06:06,">> Scandal, Navier."
00:06:06,00:06:10,">> Scandal, Navier, absolutely."
00:06:10,00:06:13,"She's really interesting though, her background is so interesting."
00:06:13,00:06:18,She is what's called a Tiske Barnas or a German child.
00:06:18,00:06:23,"And these were people in Norway who during the war, the 1930s in the Second World War,"
00:06:23,00:06:28,the Nazis had a policy of interbreeding their men with Norwegian women to create
00:06:28,00:06:33,perfect Aryan offspring who would then sort of be given back to the SS and
00:06:33,00:06:36,be a brilliant Aryan race for the Nazis.
00:06:36,00:06:40,"And she was a child of that, but she was born in 1945."
00:06:40,00:06:43,"So her mother was Norwegian, her father was a German soldier who"
00:06:43,00:06:47,"was in Norway, and then immediately they were completely ostracised."
00:06:47,00:06:51,"And had a hell of a time, and they couldn't get jobs."
00:06:51,00:06:54,And most of them have really awful lives as a result.
00:06:54,00:06:58,And I think they got compensation from Europe a few years ago.
00:06:58,00:07:00,>> Did they get it in the end?
00:07:00,00:07:01,"I remember- >> I'm actually not sure,"
00:07:01,00:07:04,"I know they fought for it, but still, not fucking Swedish."
00:07:04,00:07:05,>> [LAUGH]
00:07:05,00:07:09,>> Just on the sort of mania of when they hit and
00:07:09,00:07:13,"became absolutely stratospheric, I didn't really appreciate how huge they've been."
00:07:13,00:07:18,"So just for an example, they visited Australia in the mid-70s."
00:07:18,00:07:23,Their TV special in 1976 got more views than the moon landing.
00:07:23,00:07:24,>> Wow.
00:07:24,00:07:28,">> Yeah, they were so popular that in the year 1976."
00:07:28,00:07:30,">> In the 1970s though, in 1976."
00:07:30,00:07:31,">> More TVs, right?"
00:07:31,00:07:33,>> Sorry? >> More TVs.
00:07:33,00:07:34,>> I guess more TVs.
00:07:34,00:07:35,And they showed it four times.
00:07:35,00:07:39,"Yes, I mean, there are factors that mitigate, but still, it was a big event."
00:07:39,00:07:42,">> What time of the night was it, the moon landing in Australia?"
00:07:42,00:07:45,">> I don't know, I don't know, look, okay."
00:07:45,00:07:46,They were so popular.
00:07:46,00:07:50,"In 1976, they had the number one spot for 39 weeks."
00:07:50,00:07:55,"And after 12 weeks of it, their version of Top of the Pops just stopped showing"
00:07:55,00:07:57,"the music video because you've seen it for 12 weeks, guys."
00:07:57,00:08:00,">> In Australia, that was- >> Yeah, fans absolutely righted."
00:08:00,00:08:02,"And that was on the Australian version of Top of the Pops,"
00:08:02,00:08:04,which was called countdown.
00:08:04,00:08:07,">> Yeah, the Australian version of Top of the Pops was called countdown."
00:08:07,00:08:08,Why are we not talking about this constantly?
00:08:08,00:08:09,">> Oh, really?"
00:08:09,00:08:13,">> Yeah, you've just been hanging onto this fact in your head for eight years."
00:08:13,00:08:14,>> Yeah.
00:08:14,00:08:17,">> Well, when you say fans- >> Why are you moving on from this"
00:08:17,00:08:18,Top of the Pops countdown thing?
00:08:18,00:08:19,>> What? >> That's absolutely-
00:08:19,00:08:22,">> Like, is there a letters and numbers show called Top of the Pops in Australia?"
00:08:22,00:08:26,">> No, I don't think so, but- >> Well, what do you call countdown?"
00:08:26,00:08:27,>> I don't think we have countdown.
00:08:27,00:08:29,>> All right. >> They can't spell in Australia.
00:08:29,00:08:32,>> [LAUGH]
00:08:32,00:08:35,">> Well, when you say fans rioted."
00:08:35,00:08:36,>> Did I say rioted?
00:08:36,00:08:37,">> Yeah. >> I meant, were furious."
00:08:37,00:08:40,>> [LAUGH]
00:08:40,00:08:43,>> One complaint was registered with the ABC.
00:08:43,00:08:46,">> No, but generally, look, when they toured, one mother ran and she put her baby"
00:08:46,00:08:50,down on the road so that their tour caravan would stop and she could get an autograph.
00:08:50,00:08:51,>> Whoa.
00:08:51,00:08:55,>> There was a hotel which cut up their bedsheets after they'd left and
00:08:55,00:08:56,they sold it via newspaper.
00:08:56,00:08:57,>> They did that all the time.
00:08:57,00:08:59,"Yeah, they did that with the Beatles as well and this thing."
00:08:59,00:09:00,I've got about six of them.
00:09:00,00:09:01,">> Not the baby thing, though."
00:09:01,00:09:03,"I just wanted to know, we will not succumb to that kind of blackmail."
00:09:03,00:09:06,"If there's a baby in front of our tour bus, we're going straight over it."
00:09:06,00:09:10,>> [LAUGH]
00:09:10,00:09:11,">> You think that's fish policy, right?"
00:09:11,00:09:18,>> [LAUGH]
00:09:18,00:09:20,>> Is it important to get that clear from the outset?
00:09:20,00:09:22,>> That's good.
00:09:22,00:09:24,>> My God.
00:09:24,00:09:28,"Who do you think is the biggest band ever from Sweden, according to the billboard"
00:09:28,00:09:29,charts?
00:09:29,00:09:31,>> The biggest band ever from Sweden.
00:09:31,00:09:34,I'm going to put my foot on the landmine and say ABBA.
00:09:34,00:09:35,>> It is not ABBA.
00:09:35,00:09:37,It is Rockset.
00:09:37,00:09:38,Isn't that interesting?
00:09:38,00:09:41,"Yeah, Rockset have had four number ones."
00:09:41,00:09:42,ABBA have only had one.
00:09:42,00:09:46,And the interesting thing about that is they were a band in Sweden.
00:09:46,00:09:49,"And there was a high school student who was on exchange in Sweden,"
00:09:49,00:09:52,"heard about Rockset, went home, brought a record home with him,"
00:09:52,00:09:56,"and pestered the local radio station in Minneapolis every single day saying,"
00:09:56,00:09:58,"play this, play this, play this."
00:09:58,00:10:00,"Eventually, they did play it."
00:10:00,00:10:04,"And within two months, they had a record deal in the US and the number one single."
00:10:04,00:10:04,>> My God.
00:10:04,00:10:06,>> Isn't that cool?
00:10:06,00:10:09,"But really, mostly the best, well, we all know what the best band from Sweden"
00:10:09,00:10:13,"really is, and that is Rednecks, the singers of Cotton Eye Joe."
00:10:13,00:10:14,They're from Sweden.
00:10:14,00:10:15,>> Cool.
00:10:15,00:10:16,">> Cotton Eye Joe, the song."
00:10:16,00:10:17,Do you know what that's about?
00:10:17,00:10:19,>> I've been there long to somewhere.
00:10:19,00:10:20,He's been somewhere.
00:10:20,00:10:21,>> Where did you come from?
00:10:21,00:10:21,Where did you go?
00:10:21,00:10:22,>> Where did you come from?
00:10:22,00:10:23,Cotton Eye Joe?
00:10:23,00:10:24,What's it about?
00:10:24,00:10:25,What's Cotton Eye mean?
00:10:25,00:10:26,>> He's a teddy.
00:10:26,00:10:27,He must be a teddy.
00:10:27,00:10:29,">> No, he's someone with syphilis."
00:10:29,00:10:30,>> Ah.
00:10:30,00:10:33,>> So we think possibly it's from the 1800s.
00:10:33,00:10:37,"It's an African-American folk song about a man who has cotton eyes,"
00:10:37,00:10:39,and that's either from syphilis or from drinking too much moonshine.
00:10:39,00:10:40,>> Right.
00:10:40,00:10:42,>> What do you mean syphilis turns your eyes to cotton?
00:10:42,00:10:45,>> It kind of makes them go milky.
00:10:45,00:10:46,">> Okay, okay."
00:10:46,00:10:50,>> So the other really interesting thing about Rednecks is when Napster came out
00:10:50,00:10:55,"and everyone started sharing music, the manager who owned all of the rights"
00:10:55,00:10:58,"called Peter Edinburgh, he decided there was no point selling records anymore."
00:10:58,00:11:02,What we're going to be is like a band who just goes around performing.
00:11:02,00:11:08,And so he got rid of all the original members and brought in 20 new Rednecks.
00:11:08,00:11:12,And that means they can play five different gigs on the same night.
00:11:12,00:11:12,>> Wow.
00:11:12,00:11:16,">> There's a Rednecks in Australia, so they can play in Australian gigs."
00:11:16,00:11:17,>> When are we going to do this?
00:11:17,00:11:18,>> This is amazing.
00:11:18,00:11:23,"There's an online shop where if you pay 11,111 euros,"
00:11:23,00:11:26,you can get a private show anywhere in the world from Rednecks.
00:11:26,00:11:27,>> Right.
00:11:27,00:11:31,">> And if you pay 2 million euros, you get the entire band."
00:11:31,00:11:32,">> I was going to say, can you mix and match?"
00:11:32,00:11:36,Can you make your fantasy Rednecks team kind of thing?
00:11:36,00:11:37,That'd be amazing.
00:11:37,00:11:37,Wow.
00:11:37,00:11:39,>> Why don't you take Larry over here?
00:11:39,00:11:40,He's got gonorrhea.
00:11:40,00:11:40,>> Yeah.
00:11:40,00:11:45,>> I have one tiny last thing before we move on.
00:11:45,00:11:46,"They're Eurovision, just very quickly back to that."
00:11:46,00:11:49,Because that's the thing that exploded them to the world.
00:11:49,00:11:52,"The UK, do you know what they gave them point-wise?"
00:11:52,00:11:53,Null points.
00:11:53,00:11:53,>> Did we?
00:11:53,00:11:57,>> We're famously good in Eurovision at judging and participating.
00:11:57,00:12:00,>> And you know who the interval act was at that year's Eurovision?
00:12:00,00:12:01,>> No.
00:12:01,00:12:02,>> The Wombles.
00:12:02,00:12:11,>> That's a big year.
00:12:11,00:12:12,>> They would have won.
00:12:12,00:12:14,"If they'd been formally entered, they would have won."
00:12:14,00:12:16,They would have cleaned up.
00:12:16,00:12:20,">> Well, listen, we need to move on to our next fact."
00:12:20,00:12:24,"It is time for fact number two, and that is James."
00:12:24,00:12:29,">> Okay, my fact this week is that by changing the genome of a daddy long legs,"
00:12:29,00:12:32,scientists have created a daddy short legs.
00:12:32,00:12:36,>> What do they do to the genome?
00:12:36,00:12:38,"Because it sounds like if you want shorter legs,"
00:12:38,00:12:40,"you're going to make shorter genes, right?"
00:12:40,00:12:43,>> And you'll need shorter genes once you've got shorter legs.
00:12:43,00:12:46,">> Yeah, that was the joke."
00:12:46,00:12:49,"I'm just a hype person, everyone jokes tonight, I'm with you."
00:12:49,00:12:50,">> I appreciate that, I really do."
00:12:50,00:12:55,"Okay, so just to confirm, what we're talking about here is Harvestman spiders."
00:12:55,00:12:58,And that is what Americans call daddy long legs.
00:12:58,00:13:00,"We would sometimes call those daddy long legs,"
00:13:00,00:13:03,but more often we would say crane flies are daddy long legs.
00:13:03,00:13:05,"But anyway, they're actually not spiders or arachnids,"
00:13:05,00:13:07,"but they have four pairs of legs, they walk around,"
00:13:07,00:13:09,they have two pairs of legs that feel stuff.
00:13:09,00:13:12,And the legs have got these things called tarsamias.
00:13:12,00:13:15,"And if you think about your hand, you've got these little knuckle bits here,"
00:13:15,00:13:18,"you've got like two on each finger, that means you can grip stuff."
00:13:18,00:13:22,"They have got loads of these, which means they can really grip around stuff."
00:13:22,00:13:24,"And the scientists wanted to learn more about them,"
00:13:24,00:13:28,and so they did so by turning off some genes.
00:13:28,00:13:30,"And in this particular case, they turned off the gene"
00:13:30,00:13:32,"that made all these extra little nubby bits,"
00:13:32,00:13:35,"and they ended up with really, really short leg spiders."
00:13:35,00:13:37,">> Why? It's science, Anna."
00:13:37,00:13:39,">> Just to see, right?"
00:13:39,00:13:41,"Because they're confused by the Harvestman, the daddy long legs,"
00:13:41,00:13:42,"and they just think, ""Why have you got..."""
00:13:42,00:13:44,It's like having a hundred knuckles on a finger.
00:13:44,00:13:48,">> Exactly, so imagine, Anna, that we work out which gene does this in the Harvestman,"
00:13:48,00:13:51,and we could somehow get that gene sorted in ourselves.
00:13:51,00:13:54,We could have the bendiest fingers like Mr. Tickle.
00:13:54,00:13:58,>> That's the dream. It's the dream come true.
00:13:58,00:14:00,"They use them to mate with each other, don't they?"
00:14:00,00:14:01,That seems to be the main purpose of their career.
00:14:01,00:14:03,">> Yeah, I'm not saying we would do it that way."
00:14:03,00:14:06,">> I mean, you must have a vested interest in this somewhere."
00:14:06,00:14:10,"No, they seem to sort of mate by lassoing their arms around each other."
00:14:10,00:14:14,"So, yeah, they'll extend their arms and they'll wrap it around the male,"
00:14:14,00:14:16,"we'll wrap it around the female's arms, dozens of times."
00:14:16,00:14:19,"So it's really locked on, and then they mate, throat to throat."
00:14:19,00:14:20,">> James, I have a question."
00:14:20,00:14:24,Were these daddy's short legs bad at sex as a result?
00:14:24,00:14:25,Were they able to...
00:14:25,00:14:29,>> I didn't try.
00:14:29,00:14:31,I imagine they would be.
00:14:31,00:14:34,I can't tell you for sure it wasn't in the paper whether they were bad at sex.
00:14:34,00:14:37,"But you would think so, because the legs, like Anna said,"
00:14:37,00:14:41,they are quite important in the sexual thing with the Harvestman spiders.
00:14:41,00:14:44,"For instance, the male will often grab the female's leg"
00:14:44,00:14:47,and just start nibbling on it because it's really hairy.
00:14:47,00:14:50,So it's got a really hairy leg and it'll just sort of nibble on the hairs.
00:14:50,00:14:53,">> We don't really know why they do that though, right?"
00:14:53,00:14:56,"It's like, and they sort of jiggle the leg around and stuff."
00:14:56,00:14:57,">> Yeah, they can't tell why."
00:14:57,00:15:00,">> The article I read said ""presumably for her pleasure"","
00:15:00,00:15:03,"but that's a big presumption to make, isn't it?"
00:15:03,00:15:05,>> There is another thing about that.
00:15:05,00:15:11,"Actually, the oldest genitals found in 2003 were..."
00:15:11,00:15:13,"I don't know if it's been superseded by some even older genitals,"
00:15:13,00:15:18,"but it was a Harvestman, which was 400 million years old,"
00:15:18,00:15:19,which I find absolutely mind-boggling.
00:15:19,00:15:22,"There was another one found a bit later in Myanmar,"
00:15:22,00:15:26,"which was, again, trapped in amber, like in Jurassic Park or whatever,"
00:15:26,00:15:29,"which was 100 million years old,"
00:15:29,00:15:31,but it was very exciting because it was erect.
00:15:31,00:15:34,"And the story about it in live science, it started with the words,"
00:15:34,00:15:38,"""If you think an erection lasting more than four hours is a problem,"
00:15:38,00:15:41,"try one lasting more than 99 million years."""
00:15:41,00:15:43,>> But it's amazing that we found it
00:15:43,00:15:46,because it's very rare to see a Harvestman or a Daddy Long Legs
00:15:46,00:15:48,with an erect penis.
00:15:48,00:15:48,>> Exactly.
00:15:48,00:15:53,">> It's a very rare thing, and it's even rarer to see it in fossils/in amber."
00:15:53,00:15:55,"We've only ever found, up until the point of this article,"
00:15:55,00:15:59,"you're talking about 38 fossils of Harvestmen in history,"
00:15:59,00:16:04,"and one of those has a penis coming out of it and they didn't expect it,"
00:16:04,00:16:07,and they could tell that it was a different species to other ones now alive
00:16:07,00:16:08,because of its penis.
00:16:08,00:16:14,"It has a sort of heart-shaped top, so yeah, it's really sweet, yeah."
00:16:14,00:16:17,"And when you look at it, it's genuinely, it's like a little emoji,"
00:16:17,00:16:21,"like it's very cute, but that penis, that erection,"
00:16:21,00:16:22,"we think it may have been mating,"
00:16:22,00:16:25,but we think it may not have been mating as well.
00:16:25,00:16:27,">> Man might have just been watching ""Dinosaur Porn"" or something,"
00:16:27,00:16:29,whatever it was back then.
00:16:29,00:16:31,>> We think either it was mating and it got stuck in the amber
00:16:31,00:16:34,"and then somehow the female got away, for example,"
00:16:34,00:16:38,"or the amber started to roll over it and its blood pressure just went,"
00:16:38,00:16:42,"boom, it went right up and the penis was literally just pushed out of it"
00:16:42,00:16:45,in a kind of big death erection and then it died.
00:16:45,00:16:47,">> I'll be honest, when I did this fact,"
00:16:47,00:16:50,I thought we would be talking about spiders
00:16:50,00:16:52,"and daddy long legs and genomes and stuff,"
00:16:52,00:16:56,and we seem to have gotten onto the death erection.
00:16:56,00:16:57,>> We were going to get onto the penis
00:16:57,00:16:59,because they are the only arachnids with a penis
00:16:59,00:17:03,and so I imagine that they would want us to be mentioning that
00:17:03,00:17:05,if they knew that we were talking about it.
00:17:05,00:17:08,>> Spiders just have like pedipalps that they put their sperm on to
00:17:08,00:17:10,and then spray around. >> You know a spider man?
00:17:10,00:17:12,">> Yes, I think he has the pedipalps."
00:17:12,00:17:14,>> Does he?
00:17:14,00:17:20,">> There are so many species, there are 6500 species of harvestmen"
00:17:20,00:17:23,"and then that's not even including crane flies, obviously,"
00:17:23,00:17:26,"and they let off a disgusting smell when they're under threat,"
00:17:26,00:17:29,"which apparently you can smell, so if you see one under threat,"
00:17:29,00:17:31,"which it probably will be if you're approaching it,"
00:17:31,00:17:34,then try and touch it and it smells a bit like petrol apparently.
00:17:34,00:17:38,">> Yeah, and sometimes you get massive clumps of them, don't you?"
00:17:38,00:17:40,There was one in southwestern China
00:17:40,00:17:44,"that had 300,000 individuals in a clump."
00:17:44,00:17:48,And it just looks like this hairy blob that's kind of going around.
00:17:48,00:17:52,">> Oh wow, what do you mean they kind of roll like a ball together kind of thing?"
00:17:52,00:17:55,>> They don't roll so much as kind of walk and crawl.
00:17:55,00:17:59,"And there are some on top as well, so they're a little bit kind of on top of each other."
00:17:59,00:18:02,"It can be hundreds of thousands of them and they think that possibly,"
00:18:02,00:18:03,"again, we're not sure why they do this,"
00:18:03,00:18:07,"but one reason could be that if they're all giving off this fatty smell,"
00:18:07,00:18:09,then it might make it even more potent.
00:18:09,00:18:11,">> Oh, okay."
00:18:11,00:18:17,"You can't be blamed if there are 300,000 of you in the same, yeah."
00:18:17,00:18:21,">> They can lose legs, but they can't grow them back."
00:18:21,00:18:24,"So in the same way that we can lose legs, they can lose legs,"
00:18:24,00:18:29,"but they do it more often, so they'll lose a leg defensively sometimes."
00:18:29,00:18:33,"If they're being predated on, then they'll kind of rip off one of their legs"
00:18:33,00:18:34,"and leave it behind, and they can be fine."
00:18:34,00:18:36,"They can be basically fine with two legs lost,"
00:18:36,00:18:38,but their gait changes a little bit.
00:18:38,00:18:42,So it seems that they start to use their body as a replacement leg.
00:18:42,00:18:46,"So they do what's called ""stopting"" if they're down to seven legs,"
00:18:46,00:18:50,which seems to be they brush their bellies against the ground with every stride.
00:18:50,00:18:53,"And then if they lose two legs, they turn to bobbing,"
00:18:53,00:18:57,"which is where they really bounce like a bouncy ball along the ground, up and down."
00:18:57,00:19:00,"And sometimes they just bob up and down on the spot really, really fast."
00:19:00,00:19:01,We don't really know why.
00:19:01,00:19:02,Maybe to like evade birds or something.
00:19:02,00:19:04,Wow.
00:19:04,00:19:07,"It's weird how, so like in picture of Daddy Long Legs in my head,"
00:19:07,00:19:09,but the body is not quite in my head.
00:19:09,00:19:11,"So just as a sort of an equivalent,"
00:19:11,00:19:16,"if humans had the length of the leg that a Daddy Long Legs had,"
00:19:16,00:19:19,it would be as if we had 80 foot long limbs.
00:19:19,00:19:20,- Wow. - 80 foot?
00:19:20,00:19:24,"- 80 foot, yeah, compared to body size, the torso bit."
00:19:24,00:19:26,"And that is Mr. Tickle, isn't it?"
00:19:26,00:19:27,"Just to go back to, oh, it is."
00:19:27,00:19:29,"That's what he's got, basically."
00:19:29,00:19:29,That's true.
00:19:29,00:19:31,"- Wow. - And the Daddy Long Legs,"
00:19:31,00:19:36,"Harvestman and Cranefly, they've only been known that since 1820."
00:19:36,00:19:39,"Before that, they were known as Father Long Legs."
00:19:39,00:19:41,"- No, they're four more. - Yeah, in the 1740s."
00:19:41,00:19:42,- That's nice. - Father Long Legs.
00:19:42,00:19:47,"And even 100 years before that, Craneflies were known as Harry Long Legs."
00:19:47,00:19:48,- Oh. - Yeah.
00:19:48,00:19:51,"I've read that in Ireland, they're called Skinny Philip."
00:19:51,00:19:52,[LAUGHTER]
00:19:52,00:19:55,I don't know why.
00:19:55,00:19:58,- That's a cartoon I would watch. - That's a cartoon I would watch.
00:19:58,00:19:59,"- Skinny Philip. - Oh, man."
00:19:59,00:20:02,"So, yeah, the Craneflies, which I think maybe we know a bit better in the UK,"
00:20:02,00:20:04,"just there are so many more of them, especially in autumn,"
00:20:04,00:20:07,"they live underground for 10 months,"
00:20:07,00:20:09,"and then they come out for a few days, they mate, and then they die."
00:20:09,00:20:14,"What we're seeing is, it's almost none of the story of the Daddy Long Legs."
00:20:14,00:20:16,"But the rest of the story is quite dull, isn't it?"
00:20:16,00:20:17,[LAUGHTER]
00:20:17,00:20:20,It's like following Sleeping Beauty's story while she's asleep.
00:20:20,00:20:23,They're not asleep. They're well alive under the earth.
00:20:23,00:20:25,"- Are they? - Yeah, of course they are. They're lovely."
00:20:25,00:20:26,"No, I know they're alive, but what do they do?"
00:20:26,00:20:28,"They're awake. Well, they're moving around."
00:20:28,00:20:31,They have expandable arses when they're lovely.
00:20:31,00:20:33,- You want me to... - I think we all do.
00:20:33,00:20:35,[LAUGHTER]
00:20:35,00:20:39,"No, they have inflatable arses that they fill up with hemolyph,"
00:20:39,00:20:40,like kind of like fluid.
00:20:40,00:20:44,And that's how they move through the soil to push them forward
00:20:44,00:20:46,as they inflate their bottoms.
00:20:46,00:20:47,And they're fat worms.
00:20:47,00:20:50,They're much fatter than a Daddy Long Legs' body when they're worms.
00:20:50,00:20:52,And then it lodges them in the earth.
00:20:52,00:20:55,"So, if they need to eat a bunch of leaf matter, then it roots them in"
00:20:55,00:20:58,"because their bum just, you know, clogs up the soil around them."
00:20:58,00:21:00,- It's a very clever move. - That's awesome.
00:21:00,00:21:03,"- Yeah, watch that show. - There you go."
00:21:03,00:21:05,"It's the best time of their lives, and we never get to see it."
00:21:05,00:21:09,"Yeah. We're going to have to move on in a second, guys, to our next fact."
00:21:09,00:21:12,"In 2016, there was an entomologist called Liz Fowler,"
00:21:12,00:21:14,and she went to the island of St Helena
00:21:14,00:21:18,to look for something called the Basilevsky's crane fly.
00:21:18,00:21:21,People thought it'd been extinct for about 40 or 50 years.
00:21:21,00:21:23,No one has seen one for 45 years.
00:21:23,00:21:27,"While she was driving along, one of them flew into a car and landed in a hand."
00:21:27,00:21:29,"- Oh, wow. - Oh, wow."
00:21:29,00:21:32,"Did you know that was it? She didn't sort of crush it, toss it out."
00:21:32,00:21:34,"- No, she knew. - Someone found it years later."
00:21:34,00:21:39,"Well, listen, we need to move on to our next fact."
00:21:39,00:21:44,"Okay, it is time for fact number three, and that is Andy."
00:21:44,00:21:49,My fact is that Kew Gardens has managed to keep the same pot plant alive
00:21:49,00:21:52,for 246 years.
00:21:52,00:21:57,"- Yeah. - It's beaten my record by 246 years, pretty much."
00:21:57,00:22:01,"Yeah, it's an incredible plant, but it's also an incredible effort."
00:22:01,00:22:06,"It's really amazing. So it's a plant called Encephalatos Altensteini,"
00:22:06,00:22:08,"and it's in the palm house at Kew Gardens,"
00:22:08,00:22:10,"which is one of the really, really warm greenhouses."
00:22:10,00:22:15,"It weighs a ton, literally it weighs one ton, and it's four metres high,"
00:22:15,00:22:18,and it was collected in 1774.
00:22:18,00:22:22,"Isn't that amazing? So that's what King Louis XVI in France,"
00:22:22,00:22:24,pre-French Revolution.
00:22:24,00:22:28,I heard someone say that it's older than the founding of the United States of America.
00:22:28,00:22:32,"- Just about, just snuck in there. - Yeah, just snuck in there, exactly."
00:22:32,00:22:35,"My God, maybe that was what made them strike for independence."
00:22:35,00:22:37,"- Yeah. - What, when it left?"
00:22:37,00:22:39,"Talk us through that, yeah."
00:22:39,00:22:41,When the British took it.
00:22:41,00:22:44,"It's hard to see the chain of causation, but it could be."
00:22:44,00:22:47,"Yeah, that's a song missing from the Hamilton musical there."
00:22:47,00:22:49,Lynn was desperate to get in.
00:22:49,00:22:51,I met it recently. I met the pot plant.
00:22:51,00:22:54,"- Yeah, did you? - Yeah, we did a gig on this tour in Richmond,"
00:22:54,00:22:57,"and before we went there, I went with my family to go see it,"
00:22:57,00:23:00,"and we were in this beautiful, this greenhouse that you go in,"
00:23:00,00:23:02,"and it's so hot in there, it's very sweaty,"
00:23:02,00:23:04,"and you're cutting around the corner,"
00:23:04,00:23:06,"and then there's this little post that says,"
00:23:06,00:23:08,"""Oldest pot plant in the world,"" question mark."
00:23:08,00:23:12,"I did a really weird thing, which was I handshucked its leaf."
00:23:12,00:23:14,- What? - 'Cause I read that print.
00:23:14,00:23:17,"I'm like, ""You're such a star fucker. It's unbelievable."""
00:23:17,00:23:20,Anything for a photo with some celebrity.
00:23:20,00:23:23,"I didn't get a photo. I respected its privacy, but I..."
00:23:23,00:23:26,"'Cause I read somewhere, I think we did on the podcast,"
00:23:26,00:23:29,"that Prince Charles, whenever he plants a new tree before he goes,"
00:23:29,00:23:32,"he shakes its branch and says, ""Have a good life."""
00:23:32,00:23:34,- And so I... - What?
00:23:34,00:23:36,"Yeah, just 'cause he talks to trees, right?"
00:23:36,00:23:39,"I knew he talks to trees, but I didn't think he sort of formally spoke to them."
00:23:39,00:23:41,"Yeah, no, he shakes their branch, and he says, ""Good luck."""
00:23:41,00:23:43,"I hope it goes well, and so I did the same thing."
00:23:43,00:23:45,I sort of gave it a little shake.
00:23:45,00:23:49,"It feels like the ship sailed, if you're wishing good luck to the already 246-year-olds."
00:23:49,00:23:51,"Well, no, 'cause he's at the other end of the journey,"
00:23:51,00:23:53,or she is at the other end of the journey now.
00:23:53,00:23:56,"I think it's a he, although it was quite hard to work out the sex,"
00:23:56,00:24:00,"'cause they are one of the few plants that have distinct sexes,"
00:24:00,00:24:03,so they need a member of the opposite sex
00:24:03,00:24:06,"in order to be able to germinate and create offspring,"
00:24:06,00:24:08,which is why they all hang out together. They're very sociable.
00:24:08,00:24:12,So we might be doing quite a cruel thing by keeping this poor chap on its own.
00:24:12,00:24:13,"Oh, yeah."
00:24:13,00:24:16,"They did a study. There's lots of mysteries about cycads,"
00:24:16,00:24:18,given that people are fascinated by them.
00:24:18,00:24:22,"There's a lot we still don't know, like how exactly they're pollinated."
00:24:22,00:24:24,"We thought it was pollinated by the wind,"
00:24:24,00:24:28,"but found out recently that actually they heat themselves up like a radiator,"
00:24:28,00:24:32,"and that vaporizes all these compounds, and then that attracts insects."
00:24:32,00:24:33,Wow.
00:24:33,00:24:35,"And their seeds are too big for most things to eat,"
00:24:35,00:24:37,so we didn't know how they were dispersing their seeds.
00:24:37,00:24:38,Oh.
00:24:38,00:24:41,And so they did this study to look at how their seeds get dispersed
00:24:41,00:24:43,"and how they spread, and it was so cool how they did it."
00:24:43,00:24:47,"The scientists who did it, they basically turned up in Queensland in Australia,"
00:24:47,00:24:52,and they superglued a bunch of metal bolts to the exposed bits of seed
00:24:52,00:24:54,"when they were on the original cycad,"
00:24:54,00:24:57,"and then they returned a few months later with a metal detector,"
00:24:57,00:24:59,and then just went around the ground seeing where the seeds had gone.
00:24:59,00:25:01,"And they'd gone underground, had they?"
00:25:01,00:25:02,They'd gone on the ground.
00:25:02,00:25:05,No seed had traveled more than five metres away from the plants.
00:25:05,00:25:06,They're very lazy.
00:25:06,00:25:07,Yeah.
00:25:07,00:25:10,"When you shook hands with the plant, Dan, they asked,"
00:25:10,00:25:12,"""Did you wash your hands afterwards?"""
00:25:12,00:25:15,Uh-oh.
00:25:15,00:25:17,"He's never washed that hand again, has he?"
00:25:17,00:25:18,"Oh, yeah."
00:25:18,00:25:20,Because they're incredibly poisonous.
00:25:20,00:25:22,"Like, really, really, really poisonous."
00:25:22,00:25:24,"Yeah, super poisonous."
00:25:24,00:25:27,They were used to execute criminals in Honduras.
00:25:27,00:25:28,What?
00:25:28,00:25:29,And cycads.
00:25:29,00:25:30,"More generally, cycads."
00:25:30,00:25:31,Yeah.
00:25:31,00:25:34,There was a guy called Villam de Van Lee.
00:25:34,00:25:37,"He was on Rocknest Island, which is near Perth,"
00:25:37,00:25:41,"and he and his soldiers etched some of these plants,"
00:25:41,00:25:45,and they said that it violently affected them both upwards and downwards.
00:25:45,00:25:47,Wow.
00:25:47,00:25:50,I could have been an awkward moment in Kia Gardens.
00:25:50,00:25:53,"God, I'm lucky I didn't do that, because I genuinely used to..."
00:25:53,00:25:55,This is very good.
00:25:55,00:25:57,"No, this is really embarrassing, but when I was a kid,"
00:25:57,00:26:00,"if I'd met a celebrity, because it was so rare,"
00:26:00,00:26:03,I had this weird reaction where I'd lick my hand.
00:26:03,00:26:08,"So after I met Julian Lennon, I licked my hand."
00:26:08,00:26:11,Did you think that some of his DNA was going to get into your mouth?
00:26:11,00:26:15,Some awesomeness would come into me from the son of John Lennon.
00:26:15,00:26:18,"Have you given up that habit over the last 18 months,"
00:26:18,00:26:20,or have you kept on talking with it?
00:26:20,00:26:23,"Yeah, the last thing I did that with was a travelling piece of stone"
00:26:23,00:26:26,from Tutankhamun's burial chamber.
00:26:26,00:26:29,"God, it's gone downhill since the days of Julian Lennon."
00:26:29,00:26:31,"You're very lucky to be alive, because Julian Lennon, of course,"
00:26:31,00:26:33,is extremely poisonous.
00:26:33,00:26:36,Wasn't he used to execute criminals?
00:26:36,00:26:38,"Yes, he was, yeah, I think."
00:26:38,00:26:42,"This thing, it's one of many amazing plants in Q."
00:26:42,00:26:46,"So there was a collector called Francis Masson, who was unbelievable."
00:26:46,00:26:48,I think he's the plant hunter who collected it.
00:26:48,00:26:50,"He was the one who collected it, yeah."
00:26:50,00:26:53,So he had this incredible life going around collecting plants.
00:26:53,00:26:56,"He introduced a thousand different species of plant to Britain,"
00:26:56,00:27:01,"and he had a bad time, as in he got caught in a battle on one occasion,"
00:27:01,00:27:03,just absent-minded.
00:27:03,00:27:06,"He was in a hurricane, which destroyed all of his specimens another time."
00:27:06,00:27:08,"He was taken prisoner by the French,"
00:27:08,00:27:11,attacked by French privateers a different time.
00:27:11,00:27:15,"Basically, he was a plant hunter at a time when the world was at war over its seas,"
00:27:15,00:27:17,and so this created big problems.
00:27:17,00:27:19,And the French just didn't like plant hunters?
00:27:19,00:27:20,They did not.
00:27:20,00:27:22,He managed to talk his way out of it most times.
00:27:22,00:27:24,"So there was a time when he was in South Africa,"
00:27:24,00:27:27,and he was so interested in the plants he was hunting
00:27:27,00:27:29,that he lost all sense of time and space
00:27:29,00:27:33,and completely stopped focusing on the world around him.
00:27:33,00:27:37,"And he forgot the main thing he'd been warned before his day's work started,"
00:27:37,00:27:41,because he'd been warned there was a party of escaped convicts on the loose.
00:27:41,00:27:44,Look after yourself and keep alert.
00:27:44,00:27:47,And he then heard these clanking chains coming near him.
00:27:47,00:27:50,And he had to just run away as soon as he realized that.
00:27:50,00:27:54,"He was there watching them thinking, ""I know this rings a bell."
00:27:54,00:27:56,"I'm supposed to do something now."""
00:27:56,00:28:00,Is it approach them? Shake their hands and lick it?
00:28:00,00:28:04,"It was in South Africa that he found this plant, right?"
00:28:04,00:28:06,The one that's in Q Gardens.
00:28:06,00:28:08,"And he was around there with two other people,"
00:28:08,00:28:11,one called Thumburg and another one called Lady Ann Monson.
00:28:11,00:28:13,And Lady Ann Monson is really interesting.
00:28:13,00:28:16,She was the great-granddaughter of Charles II.
00:28:16,00:28:19,She was described as a very superior wist player
00:28:19,00:28:21,and a remarkable lady botanist.
00:28:21,00:28:25,"There's a flower now called Monsonia, which is named after her."
00:28:25,00:28:28,"And it was named by Linnaeus, who didn't really know her,"
00:28:28,00:28:30,but used to write to her.
00:28:30,00:28:32,"But he really, really, really liked her."
00:28:32,00:28:34,"And he wrote to her saying,"
00:28:34,00:28:38,"""This is not the first time that I have been fired with love for one of the first sex."
00:28:38,00:28:40,And your husband may well forgive me
00:28:40,00:28:43,"so long as I do no injury to his honor."""
00:28:43,00:28:47,Who can look at so fair a flower without falling in love with it through all innocence?
00:28:47,00:28:50,"""Should I be so happy as to find my love for you reciprocated"
00:28:50,00:28:53,"that I ask for one favor of you?"""
00:28:53,00:28:54,Strawberry.
00:28:54,00:28:55,Always strawberry.
00:28:55,00:28:58,"""I ask for one favor of you that I might be permitted"
00:28:58,00:29:02,to join with you in the procreation of just one little daughter
00:29:02,00:29:06,"to bear witness to our love, a little Monsonia flower."""
00:29:06,00:29:08,"Oh, he really kept that till the end."
00:29:08,00:29:10,She must have read it.
00:29:10,00:29:11,Fucking hell.
00:29:14,00:29:19,"So Francis Masson, he basically, he brought it back from South Africa to London"
00:29:19,00:29:22,"and they brought it on a boat, they strapped it to the deck of the boat"
00:29:22,00:29:25,because they wanted to make sure it got water and sunlight
00:29:25,00:29:27,so it didn't die in the process.
00:29:27,00:29:29,And then it was taken on a barge down the Thames.
00:29:29,00:29:33,"I mean, it's like an explorer in its own right, this plant, before it lands, you know."
00:29:33,00:29:36,"So it's meant to produce cones, this plant."
00:29:36,00:29:40,"And in the whole 240 plus years that it's been in queue,"
00:29:40,00:29:43,"it's only ever produced one cone, a single cone."
00:29:43,00:29:49,"And it was witnessed by Joseph Banks, who was the great explorer botanist as well."
00:29:49,00:29:53,"That's when he was, I believe, a director unofficially of Kew Gardens."
00:29:53,00:29:56,"And it was like just before Banks died, I think."
00:29:56,00:29:59,"The year before he died, it says that in the article, it said the year before his death,"
00:29:59,00:30:01,as if it was like the next time a cone comes.
00:30:01,00:30:02,"Well, maybe he licked it."
00:30:02,00:30:04,"Yeah, that's true."
00:30:04,00:30:09,"But my favorite thing about this tree, which I didn't notice at the time, this pot plant,"
00:30:09,00:30:14,"is that it's so old now that, like if you were old and you're getting tired,"
00:30:14,00:30:16,it can't really stand too well.
00:30:16,00:30:20,"And so it's leaning on a lot of props, just looking like it's still doing okay."
00:30:20,00:30:23,"Just knackered, just going, ""Fuck it out!"""
00:30:23,00:30:26,"Yeah, it's helping being helped up."
00:30:26,00:30:30,"Its name means ""bread in the head"", which is a cool name."
00:30:30,00:30:31,Encephalatus.
00:30:31,00:30:34,"Encephalatus ulton steinii is this specific one, isn't it?"
00:30:34,00:30:36,"And encephalatus means ""bread in the head""."
00:30:36,00:30:38,And that's because you can make bread from it.
00:30:38,00:30:40,"So you've got to be careful, obviously,"
00:30:40,00:30:43,in case you do the whole accidentally executing yourself thing.
00:30:43,00:30:46,"But apparently, like, its stem is full of starch,"
00:30:46,00:30:49,"like a really good quality starch, so you take the pith out of the stem."
00:30:49,00:30:54,"If you bury it for two months, it gets rid of the poisonous toxins."
00:30:54,00:30:58,"I actually haven't seen any evidence that this genuinely works,"
00:30:58,00:31:01,and I'm not sure you'd actually die if you didn't bury it for two months.
00:31:01,00:31:04,"It's in Jamie Oliver's 15-minute meals, isn't it?"
00:31:04,00:31:08,"Yeah, there's a few different ways they do it."
00:31:08,00:31:12,"The kochai people, they tie it up in animal skins and bury it, don't they?"
00:31:12,00:31:16,"And in Australia, there's quite a few tribes who will put it under running water,"
00:31:16,00:31:18,"like in a river, and they'll leave it there for three months,"
00:31:18,00:31:20,and then that supposedly makes it better.
00:31:20,00:31:21,Right.
00:31:21,00:31:23,"A long time to wait for breakfast, isn't it?"
00:31:23,00:31:26,"We need to move on soon, guys, to our next fact."
00:31:26,00:31:30,"Can I quickly mention, well, it's reading just a few things about Q Gardens, generally,"
00:31:30,00:31:33,and it's a pretty amazing place outside of the plants that they have there.
00:31:33,00:31:37,"So one thing to look out for next time you go, they've got bits of--"
00:31:37,00:31:40,"So in the 19th century, London Bridge was sold to America, right?"
00:31:40,00:31:44,"All of it was shipped over, except for quite a few chunky granite blocks,"
00:31:44,00:31:47,"which were part of the bridge, and that's in Q Gardens now."
00:31:47,00:31:50,"And there's a bit where it's got parked benches on top,"
00:31:50,00:31:53,"and so a lot of people are sitting on London Bridge,"
00:31:53,00:31:55,and they have no idea that they're sitting on--
00:31:55,00:31:56,"Oh, so cool."
00:31:56,00:32:00,"Did you see anyone while you were there sitting on the benches looking at their watch going,"
00:32:00,00:32:04,"""They said they'd meet me at London Bridge. I don't understand."""
00:32:04,00:32:08,I want there to be one person.
00:32:08,00:32:10,They have their own police force in Q Gardens.
00:32:10,00:32:14,"Q Gardens has its own constabulary, which they have the power to arrest you."
00:32:14,00:32:17,"So, Dan, you got very lucky, actually, with your--"
00:32:17,00:32:20,Can you be arrested for licking your hand after you've touched a plant?
00:32:20,00:32:22,I didn't lick my hand.
00:32:22,00:32:24,It should be an arrestable offense.
00:32:24,00:32:25,That's the old me.
00:32:25,00:32:27,"All I did was shake its hand and say, ""Good on you."""
00:32:27,00:32:29,I think it's a bit tree-two.
00:32:29,00:32:31,Hey!
00:32:31,00:32:33,"Hey, you're doing it."
00:32:33,00:32:38,"Look, we won't accept sarcastic rounds of applause, all right? It's not on."
00:32:38,00:32:40,"Come on, beggars, can't be choosers."
00:32:40,00:32:44,"Okay, we need to move on to our final fact of the show,"
00:32:44,00:32:46,and that is Anna.
00:32:46,00:32:51,My fact this week is that red pandas like artificial sweetener.
00:32:51,00:32:55,"They're very way-conscious, can't they?"
00:32:55,00:33:01,"Yeah, this was-- this is like if we were in a room full of red panda biologists,"
00:33:01,00:33:04,"there would have been such a gasp at that,"
00:33:04,00:33:07,"because that is astonishing information, guys."
00:33:07,00:33:10,We did not think mammals could taste artificial sweetener.
00:33:10,00:33:12,It doesn't make sense.
00:33:12,00:33:15,Primates are supposed to be the only things that can taste artificial sweetener.
00:33:15,00:33:17,"All other mammals can taste normal sugars,"
00:33:17,00:33:19,"or some of them can't even taste that,"
00:33:19,00:33:21,like cats have lost their ability to taste sugar.
00:33:21,00:33:25,"But then there was this study in 2009 at a Swiss zoo,"
00:33:25,00:33:28,where a bunch of mammals in the zoo were given a choice
00:33:28,00:33:30,"between plain water and sugar water,"
00:33:30,00:33:33,"or plain water and water with sweetener in,"
00:33:33,00:33:37,"and all the other animals didn't care between the plain water and the sweetener,"
00:33:37,00:33:40,"the mongoose, the meerkats, the lions, the ferrets,"
00:33:40,00:33:43,but the red pandas way preferred sweetener.
00:33:43,00:33:48,"And in fact, their favourite was aspartame, which is the candorail one."
00:33:48,00:33:52,Do we know why they in particular seem to like sweeteners?
00:33:52,00:33:56,"No, I think we can speculate that maybe it attracts them to bits of their diet,"
00:33:56,00:33:59,"which is all bamboo, so I don't know why it would."
00:33:59,00:34:01,"Interesting. So there is a thing about some animals,"
00:34:01,00:34:05,"like if you eat a lot of plants, then you taste more bitter things,"
00:34:05,00:34:09,"as opposed to cats that eat meat can't really taste bitter things very well,"
00:34:09,00:34:13,"and that's because a lot of plants have toxins in them, which are bitter,"
00:34:13,00:34:17,and possibly some of the taste receptors that let you taste bitter things
00:34:17,00:34:20,"are also the ones that let you taste sweet things,"
00:34:20,00:34:24,"so it might be that kind of thing, but yeah, you're right, we don't though, basically."
00:34:24,00:34:29,"Yeah, just random, but they can have a candorail in their tea and be satisfied."
00:34:29,00:34:32,We should say what a red panda is.
00:34:32,00:34:34,I did not know before.
00:34:34,00:34:36,"So pandas are black and white, aren't they?"
00:34:36,00:34:38,"Pandas are black and white, and these are red."
00:34:38,00:34:41,"They are both non-pandas, and they are the original pandas, okay?"
00:34:41,00:34:44,"So they were these little mammals, they look a bit like raccoons."
00:34:44,00:34:46,"They were thought to be raccoons, they're not raccoons either."
00:34:46,00:34:48,What the hell are they?
00:34:48,00:34:51,They were put in the bear family.
00:34:51,00:34:53,They're not bears either.
00:34:53,00:34:55,What the hell are red pandas?
00:34:55,00:34:57,"It sounds like a kids book, I reckon."
00:34:57,00:34:59,What the hell are red pandas?
00:34:59,00:35:01,"That is a really good idea for a children's book, actually,"
00:35:01,00:35:04,"because they're very sweet as well, and it's very satisfying when you see one."
00:35:04,00:35:07,"They are in the Iliuridae family,"
00:35:07,00:35:11,"and they are, I think, the only animals in the family."
00:35:11,00:35:13,"The only ones left, certainly."
00:35:13,00:35:15,They've got no relations.
00:35:15,00:35:17,They are a panda then.
00:35:17,00:35:20,They were called panda before pandas were called pandas.
00:35:20,00:35:23,"If anything has the right to be called a panda, it's a red panda."
00:35:23,00:35:27,"And pandas, am I right in saying aren't pandas, because they're bear family?"
00:35:27,00:35:29,"Well, there's no such thing as a panda, really."
00:35:29,00:35:31,A panda is just a word.
00:35:31,00:35:34,"New name, new name."
00:35:34,00:35:36,"They're both pandas, because it's in their name,"
00:35:36,00:35:38,"but yeah, panda bears are bears."
00:35:38,00:35:41,Although there's been this constant debate about whether either of them are bears.
00:35:41,00:35:44,I think we discovered panda bears are bears in the 80s.
00:35:44,00:35:47,"We thought they weren't, and they used to be called giant pandas."
00:35:47,00:35:50,"And then in the 80s, someone went, ""Oh, actually, it turns out it is just a bear"
00:35:50,00:35:52,"that's black and white. We can call it a panda bear."""
00:35:52,00:35:54,"And the weird thing is, before they were called panda bears,"
00:35:54,00:35:56,they were called party-colored bears.
00:35:56,00:35:57,Yeah!
00:35:57,00:35:58,Cool!
00:35:58,00:35:59,"That's a great name, isn't it?"
00:35:59,00:36:00,"Yeah, it's so good."
00:36:00,00:36:01,It's like disco pants.
00:36:01,00:36:02,"Disco, yeah."
00:36:02,00:36:06,"If you're trying to picture right now in your head what a red panda looks like,"
00:36:06,00:36:08,you all know Kung Fu Panda?
00:36:08,00:36:09,Yeah.
00:36:09,00:36:10,Kung Fu Panda?
00:36:10,00:36:12,That's a real giant panda.
00:36:12,00:36:15,But is it a panda? Because pandas aren't panda bears.
00:36:15,00:36:17,"So it's a bit weird, right?"
00:36:17,00:36:21,But the Kung Fu master in it is a red panda.
00:36:21,00:36:22,"Oh, is he?"
00:36:22,00:36:23,Yeah.
00:36:23,00:36:26,So he's the real Kung Fu panda of the movie.
00:36:26,00:36:27,Yes.
00:36:27,00:36:31,"Okay, there's another thing which is really annoying about red pandas and pandas."
00:36:31,00:36:35,"So pandas, giant pandas, have a pseudo-thumb, right?"
00:36:35,00:36:39,They have this weird spur on the side of their hand which helps them...
00:36:39,00:36:40,I don't know.
00:36:40,00:36:43,"Like, it's where a thumb should be, but it's not an actual thumb."
00:36:43,00:36:47,"Exactly, yeah, because they don't have thumbs because they're not primates, whatever."
00:36:47,00:36:51,"So giant pandas have that, but red pandas also have that,"
00:36:51,00:36:56,"and both of them have evolved it separately for different reasons, but they've both got it."
00:36:56,00:36:57,That's weird.
00:36:57,00:37:02,"The giant panda got it to eat bamboo, and we think the red panda got it to climb trees."
00:37:02,00:37:05,But then the red panda uses it to eat bamboo.
00:37:05,00:37:07,It's so annoying.
00:37:07,00:37:12,"And that's why people thought the giant panda was the same family as the red panda,"
00:37:12,00:37:16,"because they both had this weird thumb thing, but it turns out they're not related at all."
00:37:16,00:37:17,Wow.
00:37:17,00:37:21,"But at least there's definitely only one species of red panda, and we know exactly what that is, right?"
00:37:21,00:37:22,Wrong.
00:37:22,00:37:27,"There are two species of red panda, which no one knew about until about five years ago or whatever,"
00:37:27,00:37:31,when someone did some DNA analysis and found out there are two separate populations.
00:37:31,00:37:33,One is Chinese and one is Himalayan.
00:37:33,00:37:35,They're separate species of red panda.
00:37:35,00:37:38,"And we've been accidentally mating them for years, haven't we?"
00:37:38,00:37:41,Have they been having babies?
00:37:41,00:37:42,Yeah.
00:37:42,00:37:44,I think they're just about different species.
00:37:44,00:37:48,"You know the definition of a species is it gets kind of gray when you look too closely at it,"
00:37:48,00:37:51,but it seems like the ones on one side of the river are adapted slightly differently
00:37:51,00:37:55,"to the ones on the other side of the river, so we might be mating out those adaptations"
00:37:55,00:37:57,by accidentally making more sense.
00:37:57,00:38:01,"Imagine being one of those red pandas though, and it's because it's like being abducted by aliens,"
00:38:01,00:38:05,"being put in a room with a bear, and the aliens in there, you're looking at you like, go on."
00:38:05,00:38:06,Yeah.
00:38:06,00:38:08,But they're compatible.
00:38:08,00:38:10,"That's what's weird though, right?"
00:38:10,00:38:11,Okay.
00:38:11,00:38:14,Like could a red panda mate with a panda bear and have a baby?
00:38:14,00:38:15,I don't think so.
00:38:15,00:38:18,Have we tried?
00:38:18,00:38:25,"The first red panda that we know about in history, as in like I'm talking about in the olden, olden, olden days,"
00:38:25,00:38:30,"a fossil, it was twice as big as the modern red panda, it was found in Felix though."
00:38:30,00:38:32,Oh.
00:38:32,00:38:38,That's down the road from here in terms of like quite close geography to the rest of the world listening to this podcast.
00:38:38,00:38:41,"It's compared to the rest of the world, it's close."
00:38:41,00:38:42,Yeah.
00:38:42,00:38:45,This is the closest date on the tour to Felix though.
00:38:45,00:38:52,"And that's because this area of Suffolk used to be where giant red pandas lived, and pumas lived,"
00:38:52,00:38:58,"and mastodons lived, and you know, bison's lived, and everything used to live around here is like a jungle place."
00:38:58,00:39:00,And then obviously they all died.
00:39:00,00:39:04,"But yeah, really good fossils around here, and also really good coprolites, right?"
00:39:04,00:39:10,"And that's why when you guys were doing the sound check earlier, I went down to Coprolite Street, which is just down the road."
00:39:10,00:39:15,"Yeah, Coprolite Street, this is, we, James and I spoke about this ages ago, there's, as far as I can tell,"
00:39:15,00:39:21,"I don't know if you've looked into it more James, there is only one street in the whole world called Coprolite,"
00:39:21,00:39:22,and that's here in Ipswich.
00:39:22,00:39:26,It's amazing they haven't named any other streets after fossilized poo.
00:39:26,00:39:31,"But you figure somewhere else, and it was, there was a guy, there was a factory which was on Coprolite Street,"
00:39:31,00:39:39,"which is established by a guy called Edward Packard, a.k.a. the Coprolite King, or the golden muck man of Ipswich."
00:39:39,00:39:41,You're making it up.
00:39:41,00:39:43,"No, that's what he was called."
00:39:43,00:39:44,Incredible.
00:39:44,00:39:45,Yeah.
00:39:45,00:39:49,Are there signs on Coprolite Street saying please do not pick up after your dog?
00:39:49,00:39:52,We're in this for the long haul.
00:39:52,00:39:58,[Laughter]
00:39:58,00:40:03,"Red Panda's not very good at pooing, incidentally, on their own, or baby ones are very good at pooing."
00:40:03,00:40:08,"And this is a problem for, well, or a privilege for zookeepers who have to look after them,"
00:40:08,00:40:13,"because sometimes their mothers don't seem to be very good at maternal care, they sort of abandon them,"
00:40:13,00:40:17,and so zookeepers have to raise the offspring themselves.
00:40:17,00:40:23,"And the mothers, what they do to stimulate the offspring to poo and wee is lick their abdomen and their anuses."
00:40:23,00:40:27,"And so, as a zookeeper, I'm afraid that you've got to go up there."
00:40:27,00:40:29,You've got to lick the anus of the...
00:40:29,00:40:34,"I think you do the old Dan Shriver and you lick your hand, and then you go for it."
00:40:34,00:40:38,[Laughter]
00:40:38,00:40:42,I'll just shake you by the anus and lick my hand.
00:40:42,00:40:47,"Can't remember to lick the hand before, Dan."
00:40:47,00:40:50,[Laughter]
00:40:50,00:40:55,"That is a thing that you do with your own kids, not the licking the anus there, but..."
00:40:55,00:40:59,"Ted, you cannot make us call the social in the middle of a show."
00:40:59,00:41:02,"Well, you certainly don't do it twice, you learn your lesson after the first go."
00:41:02,00:41:08,"But no, but that, like, if my youngest Ted at the moment, if he's not had a poo and you need him to have a poo,"
00:41:08,00:41:13,"you do things like rub his tummy or bicycle his legs, or sit there going..."
00:41:13,00:41:15,And then he goes...
00:41:15,00:41:19,And then he'll crap himself because his... has force behind it.
00:41:19,00:41:23,"And sometimes you let a little thing out, but that doesn't matter."
00:41:23,00:41:26,"But that, I mean, we do that with our kids, I think, as well."
00:41:26,00:41:30,"Yeah, different tactics with the same end results."
00:41:30,00:41:32,"Yeah, yeah."
00:41:32,00:41:35,"Gosh, the world's..."
00:41:35,00:41:38,"Just feel like we all need a breather, you know."
00:41:38,00:41:41,The world's oldest living red panda.
00:41:41,00:41:43,"Yeah, died."
00:41:43,00:41:45,Sorry.
00:41:45,00:41:47,Okay.
00:41:47,00:41:49,Last year.
00:41:49,00:41:52,"Not the oldest one ever, not the Jean Calmore of red pandas."
00:41:52,00:41:57,"That one lived to 24, but this guy lived to 21 years old before dying last year."
00:41:57,00:42:00,And that's amazing because they normally lived to about 12.
00:42:00,00:42:02,"So getting to 21, big achievement."
00:42:02,00:42:04,"That's it, got it the wrong way around."
00:42:04,00:42:06,Sorry.
00:42:06,00:42:08,Easy mistake to make.
00:42:08,00:42:11,"He spent his time with another panda who was called Zoe, right?"
00:42:11,00:42:14,"And he lost his eyesight due to his extreme old age,"
00:42:14,00:42:18,and she would help him navigate around his enclosure every morning.
00:42:18,00:42:20,Isn't that sweet?
00:42:20,00:42:23,"Also, the other account is that he would wrestle other red pandas"
00:42:23,00:42:26,every morning at 9.15 a.m. on the dot.
00:42:26,00:42:29,"Come on, you think you're hard enough?"
00:42:29,00:42:31,Was he really angry?
00:42:31,00:42:34,I think it was just a species thing.
00:42:34,00:42:37,"At 9.15, did he have a digital watch?"
00:42:37,00:42:40,"I don't know what happened at 9.15, yeah."
00:42:40,00:42:44,"In the early 2000s, a red panda won Brummy of the Year."
00:42:44,00:42:46,Big award.
00:42:46,00:42:49,There was a big story about it.
00:42:49,00:42:53,There was a red panda called Babu who escaped from the Birmingham Nature Centre
00:42:53,00:42:57,"in 2005, Babu escaped, and found four days later."
00:42:57,00:43:01,"But in the interim, it was a big story of, where's he gone?"
00:43:01,00:43:04,They called him the Houdini of red pandas.
00:43:04,00:43:07,"I'm sure there wasn't much competition, really."
00:43:07,00:43:09,"I know, they're always escaping, aren't they?"
00:43:09,00:43:11,"Literally, look up a red panda in a zoo,"
00:43:11,00:43:13,and you will be looking at the story about them escaping.
00:43:13,00:43:15,"I don't know why we keep putting them in zoos,"
00:43:15,00:43:17,because they're desperate to get out.
00:43:17,00:43:19,There was one in Scotland that survived for two months.
00:43:19,00:43:22,It was just found up a tree by a farmer.
00:43:22,00:43:24,It's incredible.
00:43:24,00:43:26,I love your cows.
00:43:26,00:43:28,"We're going to have to wrap up in a sec, guys."
00:43:28,00:43:30,Some stuff on sweeteners?
00:43:30,00:43:34,"Sakarin, which was the first artificial sweetener,"
00:43:34,00:43:37,300 times sweeter than table sugar.
00:43:37,00:43:40,"But there's one now that's called Neotame,"
00:43:40,00:43:43,"which is 10,000 times sweeter than sugar."
00:43:43,00:43:46,"What's interesting about that is because it's so sweet,"
00:43:46,00:43:48,"you only have to put a tiny bit in anything,"
00:43:48,00:43:51,which means it's so small you don't have to put it in the ingredients.
00:43:51,00:43:53,"So you can just add this sweetener,"
00:43:53,00:43:55,because it's below a certain number of grams.
00:43:55,00:43:57,You don't have to add something to the ingredients.
00:43:57,00:43:59,"That's incredible, isn't that amazing?"
00:43:59,00:44:01,Do you know what?
00:44:01,00:44:03,People keep discovering artificial sweeteners by mistake.
00:44:03,00:44:05,Did you guys come across this?
00:44:05,00:44:07,"It's because they keep licking plants, isn't it?"
00:44:07,00:44:09,You've got to do the down-tribes.
00:44:09,00:44:11,It's alreadynesses.
00:44:11,00:44:13,"Anna, it is people doing the dancing."
00:44:13,00:44:15,The first one was discovered by this person.
00:44:15,00:44:18,Can we just establish which thing is the dancing?
00:44:18,00:44:21,"It's accidentally licking bits of yourself, all right?"
00:44:21,00:44:23,If you like that.
00:44:23,00:44:26,"This Russian scientist called Konstantin Falberg,"
00:44:26,00:44:28,"he sat down to dinner in 1878,"
00:44:28,00:44:30,"and he'd been at the lab all day,"
00:44:30,00:44:32,"and he hadn't washed his hands,"
00:44:32,00:44:34,and his bread roll was unbelievably sweet.
00:44:34,00:44:36,"And then his drink was really sweet,"
00:44:36,00:44:39,"and then he found even his napkin was really sweet,"
00:44:39,00:44:42,and it turns out he'd invented an artificial sweet...
00:44:42,00:44:44,"I don't know why he started eating his napkin,"
00:44:44,00:44:47,"but he realised, and he went back,"
00:44:47,00:44:49,"he just started tasting things on his work table,"
00:44:49,00:44:52,"and he had created this unbelievably powerful,"
00:44:52,00:44:54,the first ever artificial sweetener.
00:44:54,00:44:57,But that is not the only time it's happened.
00:44:57,00:44:59,It happened again.
00:44:59,00:45:01,Cyclomate is the next one.
00:45:01,00:45:04,A scientist called Michael Svader accidentally tasted something sweet.
00:45:04,00:45:06,"Aspartame, something sweet."
00:45:06,00:45:09,"A chemist called James Schlatter, he was working on another..."
