00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:19,480
 >> Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish,

3
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:24,220
 a weekly podcast this week coming to you live from Ipswich.

4
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:28,640
 >> [APPLAUSE]

5
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:30,440
 >> My name is Dan Schreiber.

6
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:35,120
 I am sitting here with Anna Tyshinski, Andrew Hunter Murray, and James Harkin.

7
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:38,440
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite

8
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:40,480
 facts from the last seven days.

9
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:43,720
 And in no particular order, here we go.

10
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:46,720
 Starting with fact number one, and that is my fact.

11
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:52,160
 My fact this week is that there's a special piano that only Benny from

12
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:58,040
 Abba can play and he can only play it if he's six miles away from it.

13
00:00:58,640 --> 00:00:59,720
 >> [LAUGH]

14
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:01,480
 >> This is such a cool thing.

15
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:05,440
 There's an Abba Museum in Stockholm, which is a fascinating place.

16
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:08,680
 And in it is a piano that belongs to Benny.

17
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:13,440
 And what they've done is they've synced up the piano with Benny's studio.

18
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:17,040
 And so anytime Benny's at home and he plays on it,

19
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:22,080
 the piano in the museum just starts playing whatever it is that he's playing as well.

20
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:25,520
 >> So what if I go to Benny's house and I'm not very good at playing the piano and

21
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:27,800
 I just play chopsticks, will that play on there as well?

22
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:30,960
 >> Well, I think it'll probably summon an ambulance to Benny's house.

23
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,520
 >> [LAUGH]

24
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:34,920
 >> Send it out on SOS.

25
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:36,840
 >> [LAUGH]

26
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:40,000
 >> It's what I'm saying, it's hooked up to an iPad.

27
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,800
 So it's not everything that plays.

28
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:46,080
 He has to decide when he's allowing the museum to hear what he's hearing.

29
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:47,240
 >> Got it, yeah.

30
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:51,640
 >> They also, they have a phone where only four people have the number of the phone.

31
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:52,400
 >> Who are they?

32
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,320
 >> Is it us four?

33
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:54,880
 >> It's us four.

34
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,360
 >> No, it's Abba.

35
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:59,920
 >> And if the phone rings in the museum,

36
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:03,820
 then you know that it's one of the four members of Abba phoning that phone.

37
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:06,400
 >> And they got the idea from Yoko Ono, didn't they?

38
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:06,800
 >> Did they?

39
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:09,120
 >> Yeah, so Yoko Ono has got quite a few of these,

40
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:13,480
 what she calls telephone pieces that's been in various different exhibitions

41
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:16,040
 around the world over the last few years.

42
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:18,800
 She did one in Argentina, she did one in New York.

43
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,720
 And her idea is that she will ring it from time to time and someone will answer.

44
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:26,000
 And when they answer, they're completing the piece, the artwork.

45
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,040
 Do you think about it that way?

46
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:27,720
 >> Yeah, yeah.

47
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:32,640
 >> So the first time someone did that, they were in a Toronto exhibition in 2002.

48
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:36,640
 And the phone rang and the guy said, hello?

49
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:39,560
 And Yoko Ono said, are you in China?

50
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:43,200
 And he said, no, I'm in Toronto, Canada, where the exhibition is.

51
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,960
 And she said, oh, I'm not in China either.

52
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,720
 And she hung up.

53
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:48,760
 >> Wow. >> Nice.

54
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:53,120
 >> Did he then get paid half the money that she'd made from selling this exhibition?

55
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,800
 That'd be amazing.

56
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,640
 >> Wow, Abba.

57
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:58,280
 >> Yeah.

58
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:00,880
 >> They were pretty unpopular in Sweden.

59
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:01,520
 >> No, they weren't.

60
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,680
 They were very popular.

61
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:06,760
 >> In Sweden, right at the start of their careers, they were seen as being,

62
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:07,840
 I can't believe this is true.

63
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:11,840
 But they became really famous in, what was it, 1974, the Eurovision?

64
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:12,960
 When they sang Mortalin?

65
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:13,440
 >> Yeah.

66
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:17,200
 >> Apparently, when they became really popular in the world,

67
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:21,360
 Sweden was so snotty about them that they cancelled the Swedish top of the pops

68
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,000
 and abolished the pop charts.

69
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:23,680
 >> What?

70
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,400
 >> Come on, no way.

71
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,720
 >> Yeah, that's what I read.

72
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:28,080
 >> Yeah.

73
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:28,520
 >> Why?

74
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,560
 Because they thought that-

75
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:30,320
 >> Just they were a bit-

76
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:31,360
 >> Have you gone to commercial?

77
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,040
 >> They were a bit commercial, they were a bit poppy.

78
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:36,240
 They were, I mean, they had an incredible and different sound, but they were also very,

79
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,160
 yeah, commercial.

80
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:40,520
 >> But they were weirdly like a super group because both Benny and

81
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:45,240
 Bjorn had very big bands that they were in before Abba came along.

82
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:49,960
 And then they got married to Agnatha and Annie Fridt, who both were big singers.

83
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,120
 And it didn't work.

84
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,320
 And one theory by one of the people who worked with them is

85
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:56,520
 because they had a terrible band name before they came up with Abba.

86
00:03:56,520 --> 00:04:01,040
 So their original band name was Bjorn and Benny, Agnatha and Annie Fridt.

87
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:01,680
 That was their name.

88
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,040
 >> [LAUGH]

89
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:06,400
 >> And then they became Abba because that was the shorthand that was used for it.

90
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,240
 >> It was a newspaper competition that got the name.

91
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:08,760
 >> Was it?

92
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:10,880
 >> Yeah, yeah, they had because they'd had other names,

93
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:13,760
 which included Alibaba and Fab and Baba.

94
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:16,960
 And then there was a Gothenburg newspaper held a competition.

95
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:19,880
 So we've got to get this band a better name because these all stink.

96
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:21,240
 And Abba was the winning.

97
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:24,320
 >> I read that they borrowed the name from a fish company.

98
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,200
 And that was on the website of the fish company.

99
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,960
 >> [LAUGH]

100
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:31,640
 >> They said that we agreed to lend our name to the pop group.

101
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:33,880
 >> I was thinking they're going to give it back at some point.

102
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:38,480
 >> It does, because it's a big fish company, everyone knows Abba fish company.

103
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:41,440
 And so I can see that it would have been controversial.

104
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,480
 They did have a weird time.

105
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:46,800
 The two couples that was made up of the two married couples got divorced within

106
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:50,120
 basically two years of each other between 1980 and 1982.

107
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:52,240
 While writing their best song.

108
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:56,720
 So if you listen to The Winner Takes It All, that was written by Bjorn, wasn't it?

109
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:00,840
 And then he got Agnetha to sing it, and they'd been married.

110
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:04,720
 And she says, it's very interesting reading what they say about the divorce.

111
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:08,360
 Because he says, God, it was the friendliest divorce on the face of the earth.

112
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:10,960
 No marriage break up could have been easier.

113
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,080
 Best friends forever.

114
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,520
 And then you read her on a separate interview going, everyone thought it was

115
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:16,920
 a really easy time, but it was actually hell.

116
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:21,240
 >> And particularly being made to sing the lyrics of this song, which are things like,

117
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:24,480
 talking about does she kiss you like I used to kiss you.

118
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:28,120
 And he'd gone off with another girlfriend weeks after they divorced.

119
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:30,040
 She's there on stage singing it.

120
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,560
 So yeah. >> That's awkward.

121
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:35,200
 And then it was 1981 when the final divorce went through.

122
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:38,040
 And so by 1982, they were all single.

123
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:41,920
 And their first album of 1982 was called The Singles.

124
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:46,160
 >> Yes. >> That's good, that's so good.

125
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:49,560
 And do you know there are, just on that note, there are Abbotributax,

126
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:53,800
 which include the beyond identity and the beyond ultimatum.

127
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,760
 But not the beyond supremacy.

128
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:58,200
 >> [LAUGH]

129
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:58,880
 >> Very funny.

130
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,560
 >> That's so good.

131
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,120
 >> And if you're not Swedish, Scandal.

132
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:03,680
 >> Really?

133
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,120
 >> Norwegian, bullshit.

134
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,560
 >> Scandal, Navier.

135
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:10,760
 >> Scandal, Navier, absolutely.

136
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:13,520
 She's really interesting though, her background is so interesting.

137
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:18,640
 She is what's called a Tiske Barnas or a German child.

138
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:23,640
 And these were people in Norway who during the war, the 1930s in the Second World War,

139
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:28,520
 the Nazis had a policy of interbreeding their men with Norwegian women to create

140
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:33,080
 perfect Aryan offspring who would then sort of be given back to the SS and

141
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:36,320
 be a brilliant Aryan race for the Nazis.

142
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:40,040
 And she was a child of that, but she was born in 1945.

143
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:43,480
 So her mother was Norwegian, her father was a German soldier who

144
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:47,800
 was in Norway, and then immediately they were completely ostracised.

145
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:51,000
 And had a hell of a time, and they couldn't get jobs.

146
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,960
 And most of them have really awful lives as a result.

147
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:58,960
 And I think they got compensation from Europe a few years ago.

148
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,120
 >> Did they get it in the end?

149
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,440
 I remember- >> I'm actually not sure,

150
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:04,720
 I know they fought for it, but still, not fucking Swedish.

151
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:05,880
 >> [LAUGH]

152
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:09,880
 >> Just on the sort of mania of when they hit and

153
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:13,720
 became absolutely stratospheric, I didn't really appreciate how huge they've been.

154
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:18,480
 So just for an example, they visited Australia in the mid-70s.

155
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:23,240
 Their TV special in 1976 got more views than the moon landing.

156
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,560
 >> Wow.

157
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:28,520
 >> Yeah, they were so popular that in the year 1976.

158
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:30,760
 >> In the 1970s though, in 1976.

159
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:31,920
 >> More TVs, right?

160
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,000
 >> Sorry? >> More TVs.

161
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
 >> I guess more TVs.

162
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,320
 And they showed it four times.

163
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:39,760
 Yes, I mean, there are factors that mitigate, but still, it was a big event.

164
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:42,360
 >> What time of the night was it, the moon landing in Australia?

165
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:45,560
 >> I don't know, I don't know, look, okay.

166
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:46,400
 They were so popular.

167
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:50,960
 In 1976, they had the number one spot for 39 weeks.

168
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:55,080
 And after 12 weeks of it, their version of Top of the Pops just stopped showing

169
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:57,560
 the music video because you've seen it for 12 weeks, guys.

170
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:00,200
 >> In Australia, that was- >> Yeah, fans absolutely righted.

171
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:02,240
 And that was on the Australian version of Top of the Pops,

172
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,080
 which was called countdown.

173
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:07,280
 >> Yeah, the Australian version of Top of the Pops was called countdown.

174
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,760
 Why are we not talking about this constantly?

175
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:09,960
 >> Oh, really?

176
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:13,920
 >> Yeah, you've just been hanging onto this fact in your head for eight years.

177
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:14,880
 >> Yeah.

178
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:17,120
 >> Well, when you say fans- >> Why are you moving on from this

179
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,120
 Top of the Pops countdown thing?

180
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,040
 >> What? >> That's absolutely-

181
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:22,720
 >> Like, is there a letters and numbers show called Top of the Pops in Australia?

182
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:26,280
 >> No, I don't think so, but- >> Well, what do you call countdown?

183
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:27,840
 >> I don't think we have countdown.

184
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,880
 >> All right. >> They can't spell in Australia.

185
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:32,320
 >> [LAUGH]

186
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:35,200
 >> Well, when you say fans rioted.

187
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,080
 >> Did I say rioted?

188
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,640
 >> Yeah. >> I meant, were furious.

189
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:40,400
 >> [LAUGH]

190
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:43,400
 >> One complaint was registered with the ABC.

191
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:46,880
 >> No, but generally, look, when they toured, one mother ran and she put her baby

192
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:50,960
 down on the road so that their tour caravan would stop and she could get an autograph.

193
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:51,760
 >> Whoa.

194
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:55,000
 >> There was a hotel which cut up their bedsheets after they'd left and

195
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,400
 they sold it via newspaper.

196
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,440
 >> They did that all the time.

197
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,600
 Yeah, they did that with the Beatles as well and this thing.

198
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,120
 I've got about six of them.

199
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,400
 >> Not the baby thing, though.

200
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:03,920
 I just wanted to know, we will not succumb to that kind of blackmail.

201
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:06,440
 If there's a baby in front of our tour bus, we're going straight over it.

202
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:10,480
 >> [LAUGH]

203
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,800
 >> You think that's fish policy, right?

204
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:18,480
 >> [LAUGH]

205
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,720
 >> Is it important to get that clear from the outset?

206
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,480
 >> That's good.

207
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,400
 >> My God.

208
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:28,480
 Who do you think is the biggest band ever from Sweden, according to the billboard

209
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,160
 charts?

210
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:31,200
 >> The biggest band ever from Sweden.

211
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,160
 I'm going to put my foot on the landmine and say ABBA.

212
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,480
 >> It is not ABBA.

213
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:37,920
 It is Rockset.

214
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:38,840
 Isn't that interesting?

215
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:41,200
 Yeah, Rockset have had four number ones.

216
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,800
 ABBA have only had one.

217
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:46,080
 And the interesting thing about that is they were a band in Sweden.

218
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:49,560
 And there was a high school student who was on exchange in Sweden,

219
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:52,840
 heard about Rockset, went home, brought a record home with him,

220
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:56,960
 and pestered the local radio station in Minneapolis every single day saying,

221
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,920
 play this, play this, play this.

222
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:00,480
 Eventually, they did play it.

223
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:04,040
 And within two months, they had a record deal in the US and the number one single.

224
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:04,960
 >> My God.

225
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,080
 >> Isn't that cool?

226
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:09,920
 But really, mostly the best, well, we all know what the best band from Sweden

227
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:13,840
 really is, and that is Rednecks, the singers of Cotton Eye Joe.

228
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:14,720
 They're from Sweden.

229
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:15,440
 >> Cool.

230
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,640
 >> Cotton Eye Joe, the song.

231
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:17,440
 Do you know what that's about?

232
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,480
 >> I've been there long to somewhere.

233
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:20,280
 He's been somewhere.

234
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:21,000
 >> Where did you come from?

235
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:21,680
 Where did you go?

236
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:22,440
 >> Where did you come from?

237
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:23,280
 Cotton Eye Joe?

238
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:24,240
 What's it about?

239
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,520
 What's Cotton Eye mean?

240
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:26,120
 >> He's a teddy.

241
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,000
 He must be a teddy.

242
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,040
 >> No, he's someone with syphilis.

243
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,880
 >> Ah.

244
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,680
 >> So we think possibly it's from the 1800s.

245
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:37,000
 It's an African-American folk song about a man who has cotton eyes,

246
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,960
 and that's either from syphilis or from drinking too much moonshine.

247
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:40,680
 >> Right.

248
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:42,680
 >> What do you mean syphilis turns your eyes to cotton?

249
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:45,080
 >> It kind of makes them go milky.

250
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:46,600
 >> Okay, okay.

251
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:50,800
 >> So the other really interesting thing about Rednecks is when Napster came out

252
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:55,040
 and everyone started sharing music, the manager who owned all of the rights

253
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:58,960
 called Peter Edinburgh, he decided there was no point selling records anymore.

254
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:02,760
 What we're going to be is like a band who just goes around performing.

255
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:08,080
 And so he got rid of all the original members and brought in 20 new Rednecks.

256
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:12,200
 And that means they can play five different gigs on the same night.

257
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:12,800
 >> Wow.

258
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:16,520
 >> There's a Rednecks in Australia, so they can play in Australian gigs.

259
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:17,600
 >> When are we going to do this?

260
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,760
 >> This is amazing.

261
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:23,720
 There's an online shop where if you pay 11,111 euros,

262
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:26,520
 you can get a private show anywhere in the world from Rednecks.

263
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:27,000
 >> Right.

264
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,160
 >> And if you pay 2 million euros, you get the entire band.

265
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,720
 >> I was going to say, can you mix and match?

266
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:36,280
 Can you make your fantasy Rednecks team kind of thing?

267
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:37,480
 That'd be amazing.

268
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:37,960
 Wow.

269
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,160
 >> Why don't you take Larry over here?

270
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:40,080
 He's got gonorrhea.

271
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:40,680
 >> Yeah.

272
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:45,000
 >> I have one tiny last thing before we move on.

273
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,960
 They're Eurovision, just very quickly back to that.

274
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:49,320
 Because that's the thing that exploded them to the world.

275
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:52,200
 The UK, do you know what they gave them point-wise?

276
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,200
 Null points.

277
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:53,840
 >> Did we?

278
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:57,920
 >> We're famously good in Eurovision at judging and participating.

279
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:00,960
 >> And you know who the interval act was at that year's Eurovision?

280
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:01,680
 >> No.

281
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:02,840
 >> The Wombles.

282
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:11,120
 >> That's a big year.

283
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,040
 >> They would have won.

284
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:14,880
 If they'd been formally entered, they would have won.

285
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,120
 They would have cleaned up.

286
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:20,480
 >> Well, listen, we need to move on to our next fact.

287
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:24,240
 It is time for fact number two, and that is James.

288
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:29,440
 >> Okay, my fact this week is that by changing the genome of a daddy long legs,

289
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:32,560
 scientists have created a daddy short legs.

290
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:36,640
 >> What do they do to the genome?

291
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:38,320
 Because it sounds like if you want shorter legs,

292
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,600
 you're going to make shorter genes, right?

293
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:43,480
 >> And you'll need shorter genes once you've got shorter legs.

294
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:46,840
 >> Yeah, that was the joke.

295
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:49,600
 I'm just a hype person, everyone jokes tonight, I'm with you.

296
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:50,920
 >> I appreciate that, I really do.

297
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:55,800
 Okay, so just to confirm, what we're talking about here is Harvestman spiders.

298
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:58,240
 And that is what Americans call daddy long legs.

299
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,280
 We would sometimes call those daddy long legs,

300
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:03,200
 but more often we would say crane flies are daddy long legs.

301
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,320
 But anyway, they're actually not spiders or arachnids,

302
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:07,440
 but they have four pairs of legs, they walk around,

303
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,560
 they have two pairs of legs that feel stuff.

304
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:12,640
 And the legs have got these things called tarsamias.

305
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:15,680
 And if you think about your hand, you've got these little knuckle bits here,

306
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:18,680
 you've got like two on each finger, that means you can grip stuff.

307
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:22,440
 They have got loads of these, which means they can really grip around stuff.

308
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:24,760
 And the scientists wanted to learn more about them,

309
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:28,120
 and so they did so by turning off some genes.

310
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:30,360
 And in this particular case, they turned off the gene

311
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:32,480
 that made all these extra little nubby bits,

312
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:35,200
 and they ended up with really, really short leg spiders.

313
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,920
 >> Why? It's science, Anna.

314
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,080
 >> Just to see, right?

315
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:41,920
 Because they're confused by the Harvestman, the daddy long legs,

316
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:42,920
 and they just think, "Why have you got..."

317
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:44,680
 It's like having a hundred knuckles on a finger.

318
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:48,600
 >> Exactly, so imagine, Anna, that we work out which gene does this in the Harvestman,

319
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:51,560
 and we could somehow get that gene sorted in ourselves.

320
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:54,920
 We could have the bendiest fingers like Mr. Tickle.

321
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:58,440
 >> That's the dream. It's the dream come true.

322
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:00,160
 They use them to mate with each other, don't they?

323
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,160
 That seems to be the main purpose of their career.

324
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:03,160
 >> Yeah, I'm not saying we would do it that way.

325
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:06,880
 >> I mean, you must have a vested interest in this somewhere.

326
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:10,160
 No, they seem to sort of mate by lassoing their arms around each other.

327
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:14,120
 So, yeah, they'll extend their arms and they'll wrap it around the male,

328
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:16,720
 we'll wrap it around the female's arms, dozens of times.

329
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:19,960
 So it's really locked on, and then they mate, throat to throat.

330
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:20,960
 >> James, I have a question.

331
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:24,560
 Were these daddy's short legs bad at sex as a result?

332
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:25,560
 Were they able to...

333
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:29,560
 >> I didn't try.

334
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:31,360
 I imagine they would be.

335
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:34,760
 I can't tell you for sure it wasn't in the paper whether they were bad at sex.

336
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:37,160
 But you would think so, because the legs, like Anna said,

337
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:41,760
 they are quite important in the sexual thing with the Harvestman spiders.

338
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:44,760
 For instance, the male will often grab the female's leg

339
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:47,360
 and just start nibbling on it because it's really hairy.

340
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:50,960
 So it's got a really hairy leg and it'll just sort of nibble on the hairs.

341
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:53,160
 >> We don't really know why they do that though, right?

342
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:56,160
 It's like, and they sort of jiggle the leg around and stuff.

343
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,760
 >> Yeah, they can't tell why.

344
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:00,360
 >> The article I read said "presumably for her pleasure",

345
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:03,960
 but that's a big presumption to make, isn't it?

346
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:05,360
 >> There is another thing about that.

347
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:11,560
 Actually, the oldest genitals found in 2003 were...

348
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:13,760
 I don't know if it's been superseded by some even older genitals,

349
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:18,360
 but it was a Harvestman, which was 400 million years old,

350
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:19,960
 which I find absolutely mind-boggling.

351
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:22,960
 There was another one found a bit later in Myanmar,

352
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:26,960
 which was, again, trapped in amber, like in Jurassic Park or whatever,

353
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:29,160
 which was 100 million years old,

354
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:31,760
 but it was very exciting because it was erect.

355
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:34,960
 And the story about it in live science, it started with the words,

356
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:38,160
 "If you think an erection lasting more than four hours is a problem,

357
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:41,560
 try one lasting more than 99 million years."

358
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:43,160
 >> But it's amazing that we found it

359
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:46,760
 because it's very rare to see a Harvestman or a Daddy Long Legs

360
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:48,160
 with an erect penis.

361
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:48,960
 >> Exactly.

362
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:53,360
 >> It's a very rare thing, and it's even rarer to see it in fossils/in amber.

363
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,760
 We've only ever found, up until the point of this article,

364
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:59,760
 you're talking about 38 fossils of Harvestmen in history,

365
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:04,160
 and one of those has a penis coming out of it and they didn't expect it,

366
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:07,760
 and they could tell that it was a different species to other ones now alive

367
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:08,960
 because of its penis.

368
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:14,160
 It has a sort of heart-shaped top, so yeah, it's really sweet, yeah.

369
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:17,360
 And when you look at it, it's genuinely, it's like a little emoji,

370
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:21,160
 like it's very cute, but that penis, that erection,

371
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:22,760
 we think it may have been mating,

372
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:25,360
 but we think it may not have been mating as well.

373
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,560
 >> Man might have just been watching "Dinosaur Porn" or something,

374
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:29,360
 whatever it was back then.

375
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,560
 >> We think either it was mating and it got stuck in the amber

376
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:34,160
 and then somehow the female got away, for example,

377
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:38,560
 or the amber started to roll over it and its blood pressure just went,

378
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:42,560
 boom, it went right up and the penis was literally just pushed out of it

379
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:45,960
 in a kind of big death erection and then it died.

380
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:47,960
 >> I'll be honest, when I did this fact,

381
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:50,160
 I thought we would be talking about spiders

382
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:52,960
 and daddy long legs and genomes and stuff,

383
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:56,360
 and we seem to have gotten onto the death erection.

384
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:57,560
 >> We were going to get onto the penis

385
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:59,960
 because they are the only arachnids with a penis

386
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:03,160
 and so I imagine that they would want us to be mentioning that

387
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:05,160
 if they knew that we were talking about it.

388
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:08,960
 >> Spiders just have like pedipalps that they put their sperm on to

389
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,760
 and then spray around. >> You know a spider man?

390
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:12,560
 >> Yes, I think he has the pedipalps.

391
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:14,160
 >> Does he?

392
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:20,960
 >> There are so many species, there are 6500 species of harvestmen

393
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:23,560
 and then that's not even including crane flies, obviously,

394
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:26,760
 and they let off a disgusting smell when they're under threat,

395
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:29,560
 which apparently you can smell, so if you see one under threat,

396
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:31,760
 which it probably will be if you're approaching it,

397
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:34,960
 then try and touch it and it smells a bit like petrol apparently.

398
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:38,360
 >> Yeah, and sometimes you get massive clumps of them, don't you?

399
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:40,960
 There was one in southwestern China

400
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:44,760
 that had 300,000 individuals in a clump.

401
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:48,760
 And it just looks like this hairy blob that's kind of going around.

402
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:52,160
 >> Oh wow, what do you mean they kind of roll like a ball together kind of thing?

403
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:55,960
 >> They don't roll so much as kind of walk and crawl.

404
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:59,760
 And there are some on top as well, so they're a little bit kind of on top of each other.

405
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:02,560
 It can be hundreds of thousands of them and they think that possibly,

406
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:03,960
 again, we're not sure why they do this,

407
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:07,760
 but one reason could be that if they're all giving off this fatty smell,

408
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,960
 then it might make it even more potent.

409
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,360
 >> Oh, okay.

410
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:17,360
 You can't be blamed if there are 300,000 of you in the same, yeah.

411
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:21,160
 >> They can lose legs, but they can't grow them back.

412
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:24,360
 So in the same way that we can lose legs, they can lose legs,

413
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:29,160
 but they do it more often, so they'll lose a leg defensively sometimes.

414
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:33,160
 If they're being predated on, then they'll kind of rip off one of their legs

415
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:34,560
 and leave it behind, and they can be fine.

416
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:36,560
 They can be basically fine with two legs lost,

417
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:38,760
 but their gait changes a little bit.

418
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:42,560
 So it seems that they start to use their body as a replacement leg.

419
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:46,160
 So they do what's called "stopting" if they're down to seven legs,

420
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:50,360
 which seems to be they brush their bellies against the ground with every stride.

421
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:53,560
 And then if they lose two legs, they turn to bobbing,

422
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:57,960
 which is where they really bounce like a bouncy ball along the ground, up and down.

423
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:00,360
 And sometimes they just bob up and down on the spot really, really fast.

424
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:01,360
 We don't really know why.

425
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:02,960
 Maybe to like evade birds or something.

426
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,160
 Wow.

427
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:07,760
 It's weird how, so like in picture of Daddy Long Legs in my head,

428
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,760
 but the body is not quite in my head.

429
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,960
 So just as a sort of an equivalent,

430
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:16,160
 if humans had the length of the leg that a Daddy Long Legs had,

431
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:19,560
 it would be as if we had 80 foot long limbs.

432
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:20,760
 - Wow. - 80 foot?

433
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:24,560
 - 80 foot, yeah, compared to body size, the torso bit.

434
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:26,560
 And that is Mr. Tickle, isn't it?

435
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:27,960
 Just to go back to, oh, it is.

436
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:29,160
 That's what he's got, basically.

437
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:29,960
 That's true.

438
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,960
 - Wow. - And the Daddy Long Legs,

439
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:36,560
 Harvestman and Cranefly, they've only been known that since 1820.

440
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:39,360
 Before that, they were known as Father Long Legs.

441
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:41,560
 - No, they're four more. - Yeah, in the 1740s.

442
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:42,960
 - That's nice. - Father Long Legs.

443
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:47,160
 And even 100 years before that, Craneflies were known as Harry Long Legs.

444
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:48,560
 - Oh. - Yeah.

445
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:51,560
 I've read that in Ireland, they're called Skinny Philip.

446
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:52,960
 [LAUGHTER]

447
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:55,160
 I don't know why.

448
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:58,360
 - That's a cartoon I would watch. - That's a cartoon I would watch.

449
00:19:58,360 --> 00:19:59,760
 - Skinny Philip. - Oh, man.

450
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:02,960
 So, yeah, the Craneflies, which I think maybe we know a bit better in the UK,

451
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,960
 just there are so many more of them, especially in autumn,

452
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:07,160
 they live underground for 10 months,

453
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:09,960
 and then they come out for a few days, they mate, and then they die.

454
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:14,160
 What we're seeing is, it's almost none of the story of the Daddy Long Legs.

455
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:16,160
 But the rest of the story is quite dull, isn't it?

456
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:17,760
 [LAUGHTER]

457
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:20,960
 It's like following Sleeping Beauty's story while she's asleep.

458
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:23,360
 They're not asleep. They're well alive under the earth.

459
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:25,160
 - Are they? - Yeah, of course they are. They're lovely.

460
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:26,560
 No, I know they're alive, but what do they do?

461
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:28,560
 They're awake. Well, they're moving around.

462
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:31,160
 They have expandable arses when they're lovely.

463
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:33,360
 - You want me to... - I think we all do.

464
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:35,960
 [LAUGHTER]

465
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:39,360
 No, they have inflatable arses that they fill up with hemolyph,

466
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:40,760
 like kind of like fluid.

467
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:44,760
 And that's how they move through the soil to push them forward

468
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:46,360
 as they inflate their bottoms.

469
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:47,560
 And they're fat worms.

470
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:50,760
 They're much fatter than a Daddy Long Legs' body when they're worms.

471
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:52,760
 And then it lodges them in the earth.

472
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:55,760
 So, if they need to eat a bunch of leaf matter, then it roots them in

473
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:58,960
 because their bum just, you know, clogs up the soil around them.

474
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,960
 - It's a very clever move. - That's awesome.

475
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,960
 - Yeah, watch that show. - There you go.

476
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:05,960
 It's the best time of their lives, and we never get to see it.

477
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:09,360
 Yeah. We're going to have to move on in a second, guys, to our next fact.

478
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:12,560
 In 2016, there was an entomologist called Liz Fowler,

479
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:14,560
 and she went to the island of St Helena

480
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:18,360
 to look for something called the Basilevsky's crane fly.

481
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:21,560
 People thought it'd been extinct for about 40 or 50 years.

482
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:23,560
 No one has seen one for 45 years.

483
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:27,560
 While she was driving along, one of them flew into a car and landed in a hand.

484
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:29,560
 - Oh, wow. - Oh, wow.

485
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:32,560
 Did you know that was it? She didn't sort of crush it, toss it out.

486
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:34,560
 - No, she knew. - Someone found it years later.

487
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:39,560
 Well, listen, we need to move on to our next fact.

488
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:44,560
 Okay, it is time for fact number three, and that is Andy.

489
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:49,560
 My fact is that Kew Gardens has managed to keep the same pot plant alive

490
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:52,560
 for 246 years.

491
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:57,560
 - Yeah. - It's beaten my record by 246 years, pretty much.

492
00:21:57,560 --> 00:22:01,560
 Yeah, it's an incredible plant, but it's also an incredible effort.

493
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:06,560
 It's really amazing. So it's a plant called Encephalatos Altensteini,

494
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:08,560
 and it's in the palm house at Kew Gardens,

495
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:10,560
 which is one of the really, really warm greenhouses.

496
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:15,560
 It weighs a ton, literally it weighs one ton, and it's four metres high,

497
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:18,560
 and it was collected in 1774.

498
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:22,560
 Isn't that amazing? So that's what King Louis XVI in France,

499
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:24,560
 pre-French Revolution.

500
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:28,560
 I heard someone say that it's older than the founding of the United States of America.

501
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:32,560
 - Just about, just snuck in there. - Yeah, just snuck in there, exactly.

502
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:35,560
 My God, maybe that was what made them strike for independence.

503
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:37,560
 - Yeah. - What, when it left?

504
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:39,560
 Talk us through that, yeah.

505
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:41,560
 When the British took it.

506
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:44,560
 It's hard to see the chain of causation, but it could be.

507
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:47,560
 Yeah, that's a song missing from the Hamilton musical there.

508
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:49,560
 Lynn was desperate to get in.

509
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:51,560
 I met it recently. I met the pot plant.

510
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:54,560
 - Yeah, did you? - Yeah, we did a gig on this tour in Richmond,

511
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:57,560
 and before we went there, I went with my family to go see it,

512
00:22:57,560 --> 00:23:00,560
 and we were in this beautiful, this greenhouse that you go in,

513
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:02,560
 and it's so hot in there, it's very sweaty,

514
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:04,560
 and you're cutting around the corner,

515
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:06,560
 and then there's this little post that says,

516
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:08,560
 "Oldest pot plant in the world," question mark.

517
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:12,560
 I did a really weird thing, which was I handshucked its leaf.

518
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:14,560
 - What? - 'Cause I read that print.

519
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:17,560
 I'm like, "You're such a star fucker. It's unbelievable."

520
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:20,560
 Anything for a photo with some celebrity.

521
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:23,560
 I didn't get a photo. I respected its privacy, but I...

522
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:26,560
 'Cause I read somewhere, I think we did on the podcast,

523
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:29,560
 that Prince Charles, whenever he plants a new tree before he goes,

524
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:32,560
 he shakes its branch and says, "Have a good life."

525
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:34,560
 - And so I... - What?

526
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:36,560
 Yeah, just 'cause he talks to trees, right?

527
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:39,560
 I knew he talks to trees, but I didn't think he sort of formally spoke to them.

528
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:41,560
 Yeah, no, he shakes their branch, and he says, "Good luck."

529
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:43,560
 I hope it goes well, and so I did the same thing.

530
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:45,560
 I sort of gave it a little shake.

531
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:49,560
 It feels like the ship sailed, if you're wishing good luck to the already 246-year-olds.

532
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:51,560
 Well, no, 'cause he's at the other end of the journey,

533
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:53,560
 or she is at the other end of the journey now.

534
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:56,560
 I think it's a he, although it was quite hard to work out the sex,

535
00:23:56,560 --> 00:24:00,560
 'cause they are one of the few plants that have distinct sexes,

536
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:03,560
 so they need a member of the opposite sex

537
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:06,560
 in order to be able to germinate and create offspring,

538
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:08,560
 which is why they all hang out together. They're very sociable.

539
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:12,560
 So we might be doing quite a cruel thing by keeping this poor chap on its own.

540
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:13,560
 Oh, yeah.

541
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:16,560
 They did a study. There's lots of mysteries about cycads,

542
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:18,560
 given that people are fascinated by them.

543
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:22,560
 There's a lot we still don't know, like how exactly they're pollinated.

544
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:24,560
 We thought it was pollinated by the wind,

545
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:28,560
 but found out recently that actually they heat themselves up like a radiator,

546
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:32,560
 and that vaporizes all these compounds, and then that attracts insects.

547
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:33,560
 Wow.

548
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:35,560
 And their seeds are too big for most things to eat,

549
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:37,560
 so we didn't know how they were dispersing their seeds.

550
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:38,560
 Oh.

551
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:41,560
 And so they did this study to look at how their seeds get dispersed

552
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:43,560
 and how they spread, and it was so cool how they did it.

553
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:47,560
 The scientists who did it, they basically turned up in Queensland in Australia,

554
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:52,560
 and they superglued a bunch of metal bolts to the exposed bits of seed

555
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:54,560
 when they were on the original cycad,

556
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:57,560
 and then they returned a few months later with a metal detector,

557
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:59,560
 and then just went around the ground seeing where the seeds had gone.

558
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:01,560
 And they'd gone underground, had they?

559
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:02,560
 They'd gone on the ground.

560
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:05,560
 No seed had traveled more than five metres away from the plants.

561
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:06,560
 They're very lazy.

562
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:07,560
 Yeah.

563
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:10,560
 When you shook hands with the plant, Dan, they asked,

564
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:12,560
 "Did you wash your hands afterwards?"

565
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:15,560
 Uh-oh.

566
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:17,560
 He's never washed that hand again, has he?

567
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:18,560
 Oh, yeah.

568
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:20,560
 Because they're incredibly poisonous.

569
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:22,560
 Like, really, really, really poisonous.

570
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:24,560
 Yeah, super poisonous.

571
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:27,560
 They were used to execute criminals in Honduras.

572
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:28,560
 What?

573
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:29,560
 And cycads.

574
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:30,560
 More generally, cycads.

575
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:31,560
 Yeah.

576
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:34,560
 There was a guy called Villam de Van Lee.

577
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:37,560
 He was on Rocknest Island, which is near Perth,

578
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:41,560
 and he and his soldiers etched some of these plants,

579
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:45,560
 and they said that it violently affected them both upwards and downwards.

580
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:47,560
 Wow.

581
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:50,560
 I could have been an awkward moment in Kia Gardens.

582
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:53,560
 God, I'm lucky I didn't do that, because I genuinely used to...

583
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:55,560
 This is very good.

584
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:57,560
 No, this is really embarrassing, but when I was a kid,

585
00:25:57,560 --> 00:26:00,560
 if I'd met a celebrity, because it was so rare,

586
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:03,560
 I had this weird reaction where I'd lick my hand.

587
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:08,560
 So after I met Julian Lennon, I licked my hand.

588
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:11,560
 Did you think that some of his DNA was going to get into your mouth?

589
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:15,560
 Some awesomeness would come into me from the son of John Lennon.

590
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:18,560
 Have you given up that habit over the last 18 months,

591
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:20,560
 or have you kept on talking with it?

592
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:23,560
 Yeah, the last thing I did that with was a travelling piece of stone

593
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:26,560
 from Tutankhamun's burial chamber.

594
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:29,560
 God, it's gone downhill since the days of Julian Lennon.

595
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:31,560
 You're very lucky to be alive, because Julian Lennon, of course,

596
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:33,560
 is extremely poisonous.

597
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:36,560
 Wasn't he used to execute criminals?

598
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:38,560
 Yes, he was, yeah, I think.

599
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:42,560
 This thing, it's one of many amazing plants in Q.

600
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:46,560
 So there was a collector called Francis Masson, who was unbelievable.

601
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:48,560
 I think he's the plant hunter who collected it.

602
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:50,560
 He was the one who collected it, yeah.

603
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:53,560
 So he had this incredible life going around collecting plants.

604
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:56,560
 He introduced a thousand different species of plant to Britain,

605
00:26:56,560 --> 00:27:01,560
 and he had a bad time, as in he got caught in a battle on one occasion,

606
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:03,560
 just absent-minded.

607
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:06,560
 He was in a hurricane, which destroyed all of his specimens another time.

608
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:08,560
 He was taken prisoner by the French,

609
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:11,560
 attacked by French privateers a different time.

610
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:15,560
 Basically, he was a plant hunter at a time when the world was at war over its seas,

611
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:17,560
 and so this created big problems.

612
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:19,560
 And the French just didn't like plant hunters?

613
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:20,560
 They did not.

614
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:22,560
 He managed to talk his way out of it most times.

615
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:24,560
 So there was a time when he was in South Africa,

616
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:27,560
 and he was so interested in the plants he was hunting

617
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:29,560
 that he lost all sense of time and space

618
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:33,560
 and completely stopped focusing on the world around him.

619
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:37,560
 And he forgot the main thing he'd been warned before his day's work started,

620
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:41,560
 because he'd been warned there was a party of escaped convicts on the loose.

621
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:44,560
 Look after yourself and keep alert.

622
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:47,560
 And he then heard these clanking chains coming near him.

623
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:50,560
 And he had to just run away as soon as he realized that.

624
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:54,560
 He was there watching them thinking, "I know this rings a bell.

625
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:56,560
 I'm supposed to do something now."

626
00:27:56,560 --> 00:28:00,560
 Is it approach them? Shake their hands and lick it?

627
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:04,560
 It was in South Africa that he found this plant, right?

628
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:06,560
 The one that's in Q Gardens.

629
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:08,560
 And he was around there with two other people,

630
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:11,560
 one called Thumburg and another one called Lady Ann Monson.

631
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:13,560
 And Lady Ann Monson is really interesting.

632
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:16,560
 She was the great-granddaughter of Charles II.

633
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:19,560
 She was described as a very superior wist player

634
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:21,560
 and a remarkable lady botanist.

635
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:25,560
 There's a flower now called Monsonia, which is named after her.

636
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:28,560
 And it was named by Linnaeus, who didn't really know her,

637
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:30,560
 but used to write to her.

638
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:32,560
 But he really, really, really liked her.

639
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:34,560
 And he wrote to her saying,

640
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:38,560
 "This is not the first time that I have been fired with love for one of the first sex.

641
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:40,560
 And your husband may well forgive me

642
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:43,560
 so long as I do no injury to his honor."

643
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:47,560
 Who can look at so fair a flower without falling in love with it through all innocence?

644
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:50,560
 "Should I be so happy as to find my love for you reciprocated

645
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:53,560
 that I ask for one favor of you?"

646
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:54,560
 Strawberry.

647
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:55,560
 Always strawberry.

648
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:58,560
 "I ask for one favor of you that I might be permitted

649
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:02,560
 to join with you in the procreation of just one little daughter

650
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:06,560
 to bear witness to our love, a little Monsonia flower."

651
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:08,560
 Oh, he really kept that till the end.

652
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:10,560
 She must have read it.

653
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:11,560
 Fucking hell.

654
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:19,560
 So Francis Masson, he basically, he brought it back from South Africa to London

655
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:22,560
 and they brought it on a boat, they strapped it to the deck of the boat

656
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:25,560
 because they wanted to make sure it got water and sunlight

657
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:27,560
 so it didn't die in the process.

658
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:29,560
 And then it was taken on a barge down the Thames.

659
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:33,560
 I mean, it's like an explorer in its own right, this plant, before it lands, you know.

660
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:36,560
 So it's meant to produce cones, this plant.

661
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:40,560
 And in the whole 240 plus years that it's been in queue,

662
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:43,560
 it's only ever produced one cone, a single cone.

663
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:49,560
 And it was witnessed by Joseph Banks, who was the great explorer botanist as well.

664
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:53,560
 That's when he was, I believe, a director unofficially of Kew Gardens.

665
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:56,560
 And it was like just before Banks died, I think.

666
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:59,560
 The year before he died, it says that in the article, it said the year before his death,

667
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:01,560
 as if it was like the next time a cone comes.

668
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:02,560
 Well, maybe he licked it.

669
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:04,560
 Yeah, that's true.

670
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:09,560
 But my favorite thing about this tree, which I didn't notice at the time, this pot plant,

671
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:14,560
 is that it's so old now that, like if you were old and you're getting tired,

672
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:16,560
 it can't really stand too well.

673
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:20,560
 And so it's leaning on a lot of props, just looking like it's still doing okay.

674
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:23,560
 Just knackered, just going, "Fuck it out!"

675
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:26,560
 Yeah, it's helping being helped up.

676
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:30,560
 Its name means "bread in the head", which is a cool name.

677
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:31,560
 Encephalatus.

678
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:34,560
 Encephalatus ulton steinii is this specific one, isn't it?

679
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:36,560
 And encephalatus means "bread in the head".

680
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:38,560
 And that's because you can make bread from it.

681
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:40,560
 So you've got to be careful, obviously,

682
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:43,560
 in case you do the whole accidentally executing yourself thing.

683
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:46,560
 But apparently, like, its stem is full of starch,

684
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:49,560
 like a really good quality starch, so you take the pith out of the stem.

685
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:54,560
 If you bury it for two months, it gets rid of the poisonous toxins.

686
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:58,560
 I actually haven't seen any evidence that this genuinely works,

687
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:01,560
 and I'm not sure you'd actually die if you didn't bury it for two months.

688
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:04,560
 It's in Jamie Oliver's 15-minute meals, isn't it?

689
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:08,560
 Yeah, there's a few different ways they do it.

690
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:12,560
 The kochai people, they tie it up in animal skins and bury it, don't they?

691
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:16,560
 And in Australia, there's quite a few tribes who will put it under running water,

692
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:18,560
 like in a river, and they'll leave it there for three months,

693
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:20,560
 and then that supposedly makes it better.

694
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:21,560
 Right.

695
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:23,560
 A long time to wait for breakfast, isn't it?

696
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:26,560
 We need to move on soon, guys, to our next fact.

697
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:30,560
 Can I quickly mention, well, it's reading just a few things about Q Gardens, generally,

698
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:33,560
 and it's a pretty amazing place outside of the plants that they have there.

699
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:37,560
 So one thing to look out for next time you go, they've got bits of--

700
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:40,560
 So in the 19th century, London Bridge was sold to America, right?

701
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:44,560
 All of it was shipped over, except for quite a few chunky granite blocks,

702
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:47,560
 which were part of the bridge, and that's in Q Gardens now.

703
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:50,560
 And there's a bit where it's got parked benches on top,

704
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:53,560
 and so a lot of people are sitting on London Bridge,

705
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:55,560
 and they have no idea that they're sitting on--

706
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:56,560
 Oh, so cool.

707
00:31:56,560 --> 00:32:00,560
 Did you see anyone while you were there sitting on the benches looking at their watch going,

708
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:04,560
 "They said they'd meet me at London Bridge. I don't understand."

709
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:08,560
 I want there to be one person.

710
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:10,560
 They have their own police force in Q Gardens.

711
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:14,560
 Q Gardens has its own constabulary, which they have the power to arrest you.

712
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:17,560
 So, Dan, you got very lucky, actually, with your--

713
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:20,560
 Can you be arrested for licking your hand after you've touched a plant?

714
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:22,560
 I didn't lick my hand.

715
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:24,560
 It should be an arrestable offense.

716
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:25,560
 That's the old me.

717
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:27,560
 All I did was shake its hand and say, "Good on you."

718
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:29,560
 I think it's a bit tree-two.

719
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:31,560
 Hey!

720
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:33,560
 Hey, you're doing it.

721
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:38,560
 Look, we won't accept sarcastic rounds of applause, all right? It's not on.

722
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:40,560
 Come on, beggars, can't be choosers.

723
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:44,560
 Okay, we need to move on to our final fact of the show,

724
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:46,560
 and that is Anna.

725
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:51,560
 My fact this week is that red pandas like artificial sweetener.

726
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:55,560
 They're very way-conscious, can't they?

727
00:32:55,560 --> 00:33:01,560
 Yeah, this was-- this is like if we were in a room full of red panda biologists,

728
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:04,560
 there would have been such a gasp at that,

729
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:07,560
 because that is astonishing information, guys.

730
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:10,560
 We did not think mammals could taste artificial sweetener.

731
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:12,560
 It doesn't make sense.

732
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:15,560
 Primates are supposed to be the only things that can taste artificial sweetener.

733
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:17,560
 All other mammals can taste normal sugars,

734
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:19,560
 or some of them can't even taste that,

735
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:21,560
 like cats have lost their ability to taste sugar.

736
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:25,560
 But then there was this study in 2009 at a Swiss zoo,

737
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:28,560
 where a bunch of mammals in the zoo were given a choice

738
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:30,560
 between plain water and sugar water,

739
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:33,560
 or plain water and water with sweetener in,

740
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:37,560
 and all the other animals didn't care between the plain water and the sweetener,

741
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:40,560
 the mongoose, the meerkats, the lions, the ferrets,

742
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:43,560
 but the red pandas way preferred sweetener.

743
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:48,560
 And in fact, their favourite was aspartame, which is the candorail one.

744
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:52,560
 Do we know why they in particular seem to like sweeteners?

745
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:56,560
 No, I think we can speculate that maybe it attracts them to bits of their diet,

746
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:59,560
 which is all bamboo, so I don't know why it would.

747
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:01,560
 Interesting. So there is a thing about some animals,

748
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:05,560
 like if you eat a lot of plants, then you taste more bitter things,

749
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:09,560
 as opposed to cats that eat meat can't really taste bitter things very well,

750
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:13,560
 and that's because a lot of plants have toxins in them, which are bitter,

751
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:17,560
 and possibly some of the taste receptors that let you taste bitter things

752
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:20,560
 are also the ones that let you taste sweet things,

753
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:24,560
 so it might be that kind of thing, but yeah, you're right, we don't though, basically.

754
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:29,560
 Yeah, just random, but they can have a candorail in their tea and be satisfied.

755
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:32,560
 We should say what a red panda is.

756
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:34,560
 I did not know before.

757
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:36,560
 So pandas are black and white, aren't they?

758
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:38,560
 Pandas are black and white, and these are red.

759
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:41,560
 They are both non-pandas, and they are the original pandas, okay?

760
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:44,560
 So they were these little mammals, they look a bit like raccoons.

761
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:46,560
 They were thought to be raccoons, they're not raccoons either.

762
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:48,560
 What the hell are they?

763
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:51,560
 They were put in the bear family.

764
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:53,560
 They're not bears either.

765
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:55,560
 What the hell are red pandas?

766
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:57,560
 It sounds like a kids book, I reckon.

767
00:34:57,560 --> 00:34:59,560
 What the hell are red pandas?

768
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:01,560
 That is a really good idea for a children's book, actually,

769
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:04,560
 because they're very sweet as well, and it's very satisfying when you see one.

770
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:07,560
 They are in the Iliuridae family,

771
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:11,560
 and they are, I think, the only animals in the family.

772
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:13,560
 The only ones left, certainly.

773
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:15,560
 They've got no relations.

774
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:17,560
 They are a panda then.

775
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:20,560
 They were called panda before pandas were called pandas.

776
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:23,560
 If anything has the right to be called a panda, it's a red panda.

777
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:27,560
 And pandas, am I right in saying aren't pandas, because they're bear family?

778
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:29,560
 Well, there's no such thing as a panda, really.

779
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:31,560
 A panda is just a word.

780
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:34,560
 New name, new name.

781
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:36,560
 They're both pandas, because it's in their name,

782
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:38,560
 but yeah, panda bears are bears.

783
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:41,560
 Although there's been this constant debate about whether either of them are bears.

784
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:44,560
 I think we discovered panda bears are bears in the 80s.

785
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:47,560
 We thought they weren't, and they used to be called giant pandas.

786
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:50,560
 And then in the 80s, someone went, "Oh, actually, it turns out it is just a bear

787
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:52,560
 that's black and white. We can call it a panda bear."

788
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:54,560
 And the weird thing is, before they were called panda bears,

789
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:56,560
 they were called party-colored bears.

790
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:57,560
 Yeah!

791
00:35:57,560 --> 00:35:58,560
 Cool!

792
00:35:58,560 --> 00:35:59,560
 That's a great name, isn't it?

793
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:00,560
 Yeah, it's so good.

794
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:01,560
 It's like disco pants.

795
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:02,560
 Disco, yeah.

796
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:06,560
 If you're trying to picture right now in your head what a red panda looks like,

797
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:08,560
 you all know Kung Fu Panda?

798
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:09,560
 Yeah.

799
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:10,560
 Kung Fu Panda?

800
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:12,560
 That's a real giant panda.

801
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:15,560
 But is it a panda? Because pandas aren't panda bears.

802
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:17,560
 So it's a bit weird, right?

803
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:21,560
 But the Kung Fu master in it is a red panda.

804
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:22,560
 Oh, is he?

805
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:23,560
 Yeah.

806
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:26,560
 So he's the real Kung Fu panda of the movie.

807
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:27,560
 Yes.

808
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:31,560
 Okay, there's another thing which is really annoying about red pandas and pandas.

809
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:35,560
 So pandas, giant pandas, have a pseudo-thumb, right?

810
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:39,560
 They have this weird spur on the side of their hand which helps them...

811
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:40,560
 I don't know.

812
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:43,560
 Like, it's where a thumb should be, but it's not an actual thumb.

813
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:47,560
 Exactly, yeah, because they don't have thumbs because they're not primates, whatever.

814
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:51,560
 So giant pandas have that, but red pandas also have that,

815
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:56,560
 and both of them have evolved it separately for different reasons, but they've both got it.

816
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:57,560
 That's weird.

817
00:36:57,560 --> 00:37:02,560
 The giant panda got it to eat bamboo, and we think the red panda got it to climb trees.

818
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:05,560
 But then the red panda uses it to eat bamboo.

819
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:07,560
 It's so annoying.

820
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:12,560
 And that's why people thought the giant panda was the same family as the red panda,

821
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:16,560
 because they both had this weird thumb thing, but it turns out they're not related at all.

822
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:17,560
 Wow.

823
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:21,560
 But at least there's definitely only one species of red panda, and we know exactly what that is, right?

824
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:22,560
 Wrong.

825
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:27,560
 There are two species of red panda, which no one knew about until about five years ago or whatever,

826
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:31,560
 when someone did some DNA analysis and found out there are two separate populations.

827
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:33,560
 One is Chinese and one is Himalayan.

828
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:35,560
 They're separate species of red panda.

829
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:38,560
 And we've been accidentally mating them for years, haven't we?

830
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:41,560
 Have they been having babies?

831
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:42,560
 Yeah.

832
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:44,560
 I think they're just about different species.

833
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:48,560
 You know the definition of a species is it gets kind of gray when you look too closely at it,

834
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:51,560
 but it seems like the ones on one side of the river are adapted slightly differently

835
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:55,560
 to the ones on the other side of the river, so we might be mating out those adaptations

836
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:57,560
 by accidentally making more sense.

837
00:37:57,560 --> 00:38:01,560
 Imagine being one of those red pandas though, and it's because it's like being abducted by aliens,

838
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:05,560
 being put in a room with a bear, and the aliens in there, you're looking at you like, go on.

839
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:06,560
 Yeah.

840
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:08,560
 But they're compatible.

841
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:10,560
 That's what's weird though, right?

842
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:11,560
 Okay.

843
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:14,560
 Like could a red panda mate with a panda bear and have a baby?

844
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:15,560
 I don't think so.

845
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:18,560
 Have we tried?

846
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:25,560
 The first red panda that we know about in history, as in like I'm talking about in the olden, olden, olden days,

847
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:30,560
 a fossil, it was twice as big as the modern red panda, it was found in Felix though.

848
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:32,560
 Oh.

849
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:38,560
 That's down the road from here in terms of like quite close geography to the rest of the world listening to this podcast.

850
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:41,560
 It's compared to the rest of the world, it's close.

851
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:42,560
 Yeah.

852
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:45,560
 This is the closest date on the tour to Felix though.

853
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:52,560
 And that's because this area of Suffolk used to be where giant red pandas lived, and pumas lived,

854
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:58,560
 and mastodons lived, and you know, bison's lived, and everything used to live around here is like a jungle place.

855
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:00,560
 And then obviously they all died.

856
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:04,560
 But yeah, really good fossils around here, and also really good coprolites, right?

857
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:10,560
 And that's why when you guys were doing the sound check earlier, I went down to Coprolite Street, which is just down the road.

858
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:15,560
 Yeah, Coprolite Street, this is, we, James and I spoke about this ages ago, there's, as far as I can tell,

859
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:21,560
 I don't know if you've looked into it more James, there is only one street in the whole world called Coprolite,

860
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:22,560
 and that's here in Ipswich.

861
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:26,560
 It's amazing they haven't named any other streets after fossilized poo.

862
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:31,560
 But you figure somewhere else, and it was, there was a guy, there was a factory which was on Coprolite Street,

863
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:39,560
 which is established by a guy called Edward Packard, a.k.a. the Coprolite King, or the golden muck man of Ipswich.

864
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:41,560
 You're making it up.

865
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:43,560
 No, that's what he was called.

866
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:44,560
 Incredible.

867
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:45,560
 Yeah.

868
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:49,560
 Are there signs on Coprolite Street saying please do not pick up after your dog?

869
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:52,560
 We're in this for the long haul.

870
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:58,560
 [Laughter]

871
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:03,560
 Red Panda's not very good at pooing, incidentally, on their own, or baby ones are very good at pooing.

872
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:08,560
 And this is a problem for, well, or a privilege for zookeepers who have to look after them,

873
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:13,560
 because sometimes their mothers don't seem to be very good at maternal care, they sort of abandon them,

874
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:17,560
 and so zookeepers have to raise the offspring themselves.

875
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:23,560
 And the mothers, what they do to stimulate the offspring to poo and wee is lick their abdomen and their anuses.

876
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:27,560
 And so, as a zookeeper, I'm afraid that you've got to go up there.

877
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:29,560
 You've got to lick the anus of the...

878
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:34,560
 I think you do the old Dan Shriver and you lick your hand, and then you go for it.

879
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:38,560
 [Laughter]

880
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:42,560
 I'll just shake you by the anus and lick my hand.

881
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:47,560
 Can't remember to lick the hand before, Dan.

882
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:50,560
 [Laughter]

883
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:55,560
 That is a thing that you do with your own kids, not the licking the anus there, but...

884
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:59,560
 Ted, you cannot make us call the social in the middle of a show.

885
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:02,560
 Well, you certainly don't do it twice, you learn your lesson after the first go.

886
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:08,560
 But no, but that, like, if my youngest Ted at the moment, if he's not had a poo and you need him to have a poo,

887
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:13,560
 you do things like rub his tummy or bicycle his legs, or sit there going...

888
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:15,560
 And then he goes...

889
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:19,560
 And then he'll crap himself because his... has force behind it.

890
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:23,560
 And sometimes you let a little thing out, but that doesn't matter.

891
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:26,560
 But that, I mean, we do that with our kids, I think, as well.

892
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:30,560
 Yeah, different tactics with the same end results.

893
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:32,560
 Yeah, yeah.

894
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:35,560
 Gosh, the world's...

895
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:38,560
 Just feel like we all need a breather, you know.

896
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:41,560
 The world's oldest living red panda.

897
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:43,560
 Yeah, died.

898
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:45,560
 Sorry.

899
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:47,560
 Okay.

900
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:49,560
 Last year.

901
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:52,560
 Not the oldest one ever, not the Jean Calmore of red pandas.

902
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:57,560
 That one lived to 24, but this guy lived to 21 years old before dying last year.

903
00:41:57,560 --> 00:42:00,560
 And that's amazing because they normally lived to about 12.

904
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:02,560
 So getting to 21, big achievement.

905
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:04,560
 That's it, got it the wrong way around.

906
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:06,560
 Sorry.

907
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:08,560
 Easy mistake to make.

908
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:11,560
 He spent his time with another panda who was called Zoe, right?

909
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:14,560
 And he lost his eyesight due to his extreme old age,

910
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:18,560
 and she would help him navigate around his enclosure every morning.

911
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:20,560
 Isn't that sweet?

912
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:23,560
 Also, the other account is that he would wrestle other red pandas

913
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:26,560
 every morning at 9.15 a.m. on the dot.

914
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:29,560
 Come on, you think you're hard enough?

915
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:31,560
 Was he really angry?

916
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:34,560
 I think it was just a species thing.

917
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:37,560
 At 9.15, did he have a digital watch?

918
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:40,560
 I don't know what happened at 9.15, yeah.

919
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:44,560
 In the early 2000s, a red panda won Brummy of the Year.

920
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:46,560
 Big award.

921
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:49,560
 There was a big story about it.

922
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:53,560
 There was a red panda called Babu who escaped from the Birmingham Nature Centre

923
00:42:53,560 --> 00:42:57,560
 in 2005, Babu escaped, and found four days later.

924
00:42:57,560 --> 00:43:01,560
 But in the interim, it was a big story of, where's he gone?

925
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:04,560
 They called him the Houdini of red pandas.

926
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:07,560
 I'm sure there wasn't much competition, really.

927
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:09,560
 I know, they're always escaping, aren't they?

928
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:11,560
 Literally, look up a red panda in a zoo,

929
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:13,560
 and you will be looking at the story about them escaping.

930
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:15,560
 I don't know why we keep putting them in zoos,

931
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:17,560
 because they're desperate to get out.

932
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:19,560
 There was one in Scotland that survived for two months.

933
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:22,560
 It was just found up a tree by a farmer.

934
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:24,560
 It's incredible.

935
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:26,560
 I love your cows.

936
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:28,560
 We're going to have to wrap up in a sec, guys.

937
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:30,560
 Some stuff on sweeteners?

938
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:34,560
 Sakarin, which was the first artificial sweetener,

939
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:37,560
 300 times sweeter than table sugar.

940
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:40,560
 But there's one now that's called Neotame,

941
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:43,560
 which is 10,000 times sweeter than sugar.

942
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:46,560
 What's interesting about that is because it's so sweet,

943
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:48,560
 you only have to put a tiny bit in anything,

944
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:51,560
 which means it's so small you don't have to put it in the ingredients.

945
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:53,560
 So you can just add this sweetener,

946
00:43:53,560 --> 00:43:55,560
 because it's below a certain number of grams.

947
00:43:55,560 --> 00:43:57,560
 You don't have to add something to the ingredients.

948
00:43:57,560 --> 00:43:59,560
 That's incredible, isn't that amazing?

949
00:43:59,560 --> 00:44:01,560
 Do you know what?

950
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:03,560
 People keep discovering artificial sweeteners by mistake.

951
00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:05,560
 Did you guys come across this?

952
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:07,560
 It's because they keep licking plants, isn't it?

953
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:09,560
 You've got to do the down-tribes.

954
00:44:09,560 --> 00:44:11,560
 It's alreadynesses.

955
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:13,560
 Anna, it is people doing the dancing.

956
00:44:13,560 --> 00:44:15,560
 The first one was discovered by this person.

957
00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:18,560
 Can we just establish which thing is the dancing?

958
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:21,560
 It's accidentally licking bits of yourself, all right?

959
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:23,560
 If you like that.

960
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:26,560
 This Russian scientist called Konstantin Falberg,

961
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:28,560
 he sat down to dinner in 1878,

962
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:30,560
 and he'd been at the lab all day,

963
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:32,560
 and he hadn't washed his hands,

964
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:34,560
 and his bread roll was unbelievably sweet.

965
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:36,560
 And then his drink was really sweet,

966
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:39,560
 and then he found even his napkin was really sweet,

967
00:44:39,560 --> 00:44:42,560
 and it turns out he'd invented an artificial sweet...

968
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:44,560
 I don't know why he started eating his napkin,

969
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:47,560
 but he realised, and he went back,

970
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:49,560
 he just started tasting things on his work table,

971
00:44:49,560 --> 00:44:52,560
 and he had created this unbelievably powerful,

972
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:54,560
 the first ever artificial sweetener.

973
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:57,560
 But that is not the only time it's happened.

974
00:44:57,560 --> 00:44:59,560
 It happened again.

975
00:44:59,560 --> 00:45:01,560
 Cyclomate is the next one.

976
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:04,560
 A scientist called Michael Svader accidentally tasted something sweet.

977
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:06,560
 Aspartame, something sweet.

978
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:09,560
 A chemist called James Schlatter, he was working on another...

979
00:45:09,560 --> 00:45:11,560
 He was working on an ulcer drug,

980
00:45:11,560 --> 00:45:13,560
 and he just tasted something incredibly sweet.

981
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:15,560
 And sucralose is the last one.

982
00:45:15,560 --> 00:45:18,560
 The researchers misheard their instructions, apparently,

983
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:20,560
 and accidentally tasted the compound

984
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:22,560
 instead of testing the compound.

985
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:27,560
 That's fantastic.

986
00:45:27,560 --> 00:45:30,560
 Look, guys, I hate to cut this off, but we need to wrap up.

987
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:32,560
 Okay, that is it. That is all of our facts.

988
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:34,560
