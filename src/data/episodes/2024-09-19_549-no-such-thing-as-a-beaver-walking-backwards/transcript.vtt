00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.440
 (upbeat music)

00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:03.040
 - Hi everyone, welcome to this week's episode

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:04.440
 of No Such Things as a Fish.

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.200
 We are slap bang in the middle of our tour right now

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:12.640
 and that means that you yourself can come and see us live.

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:14.160
 - Yes, you can.

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:15.960
 We love doing the tours.

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:17.600
 We're having a great time this time around.

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:20.160
 We record a new podcast every time we do a show

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.400
 and we have lots of little nerdy,

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:25.200
 extra never before seen bits in between

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:29.160
 and we are going to be in Cardiff, in London Town

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.120
 and in Manchester very soon.

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:33.880
 So we are in Cardiff on the 16th of October,

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:35.640
 London on the 23rd and the 24th

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.920
 and Manchester on the 27th.

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.000
 - That is correct.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.760
 And one of the places we will be very soon is Gothenburg.

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:46.160
 We will be in Gothenburg on the 27th of September.

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:47.600
 That's a week on Friday

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.400
 and we will be doing a live episode of the podcast there.

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:53.440
 So do come along, search for the Gothenburg Book Festival

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:55.680
 and you'll see all the details about that.

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.200
 - And of course you can get tickets to that

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.040
 and all the others by going to No Such Things

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:01.480
 as a Fish dot com slash live.

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:03.800
 - Okay, I don't know, I think it's time to sound check.

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:05.040
 We better get on with it.

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.720
 - Let's get on with the show.

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:07.960
 - On with the podcast.

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:12.280
 (beeping)

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:16.280
 (speaking in foreign language)

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:26.400
 - Hello and welcome to another episode

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.200
 of No Such Thing as a Fish,

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.400
 a weekly podcast this week coming to you live from Bristol.

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.140
 (crowd cheering)

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:38.200
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:40.440
 I am sitting here with Anna Tyshinski,

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:42.920
 Andrew Hunter Murray and James Harkin.

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:45.200
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.880
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days.

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.840
 And in no particular order, here we go.

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:54.200
 Starting with fact number one, and that is Andy.

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.080
 - My fact is that the unauthorized release of beavers

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:00.360
 into British waterways is known as beaver bombing.

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.520
 (crowd laughing)

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:03.360
 - That's exerting.

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:04.920
 - Yeah, this has been covered recently.

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.480
 They're all over the place now

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:07.920
 and they've been making their way back.

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.040
 So the river Otter is now full of beavers and--

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:11.880
 - Confusingly.

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:12.720
 - Very confusing.

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.520
 - Which pisses off the otters in the river Otter,

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:15.360
 as I suspect.

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:16.200
 - Are there otters in the river Otter?

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:17.440
 - There are otters in the river Otter.

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:20.160
 And I did read that someone was saying the Camel River

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:21.520
 is another good place to introduce them,

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:22.960
 which I imagine will piss off the camels

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:24.460
 in the Camel River.

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:26.120
 - And there are hundreds of them out there now.

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:27.320
 - Is that really in the UK?

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:28.560
 - In the UK, yeah, yeah.

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.960
 In researching this fact, I spoke to someone who said,

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:32.880
 very secretively, they were related to someone

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:35.520
 who knew a thing or two about reintroducing secret beavers.

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:36.360
 - Oh, really?

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.320
 - Yeah, sort of gorilla, confusingly.

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:39.920
 (crowd laughing)

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:41.600
 - The gorillas are furious.

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:44.200
 - Yeah, and so I've read an interview as well

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.000
 with a guy called Simon.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
 Basically, it takes a lot of time and paperwork

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.320
 to release a beaver outside an enclosure.

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:52.320
 You need to do an impact assessment.

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:53.680
 Sometimes on the Isle of Wight,

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:57.280
 you have to do 100,000 words of impact assessment.

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:59.860
 100,000 words, that's a novel, that's a full novel.

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:02.320
 - Yeah, and people are objecting, aren't they?

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:04.080
 'Cause no one's got time to read that many words.

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:05.840
 - But why do we want beavers anyway?

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:07.480
 - Well, because they build dams, don't they?

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:09.760
 And it creates this lovely kind of ecosystem

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:11.120
 for lots of other things to exist.

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:12.520
 They're like engineers.

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:15.640
 So there are these people, and it's such an exciting world.

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:16.760
 If you want to get into crime,

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:18.480
 but feel like you're doing kind of a good thing,

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.000
 I think beaver bombing is the way.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.840
 - Interesting.

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:23.600
 - There's a guy called Olivier Rubbers.

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:24.440
 Did you read about him?

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:25.440
 He was one of the originals.

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:28.200
 He was in 1998, he just heard someone mention

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.600
 the reintroduction of beavers and he decided,

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:33.200
 I'm gonna do that, borrowed his dad's car,

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:34.880
 and he drove to Germany.

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:37.080
 I think he lived in Belgium, drove to Germany,

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:39.160
 picked up some beavers, crossed the border,

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:41.380
 back into Belgium, dropped them in a river,

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:44.600
 went so well, he repeated it with 97 more beavers.

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:45.440
 (laughing)

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:46.280
 - Why?

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:47.720
 - He did 97 different journeys,

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:49.840
 or did he go, all right, lads, in the car?

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:51.280
 - Yeah, it's like that riddle.

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:53.040
 You're not allowed to take a beaver with another beaver,

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:54.280
 otherwise they eat each other.

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:55.400
 - Right, that's crazy.

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:58.360
 Hey, do you know, if you let a beaver into your lounge room,

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:00.760
 it will rearrange all your furniture.

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:01.600
 Isn't that amazing?

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:02.440
 - Oh, that's nice.

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:03.800
 - That's lovely, along Feng Shui principles.

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:06.960
 - No, this is a thing that was noticed by someone

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:08.920
 who wrote a lot about beavers back in the day.

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:11.680
 She was sort of a conservationist who wanted to raise

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:14.320
 the idea that they're intelligent animals

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:15.440
 that they're interesting to look at.

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:17.020
 She was called Dorothy Richards,

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:18.840
 and she was looking after beavers,

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:19.740
 and they came into her house,

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:21.520
 and as soon as they walked in, they were like,

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:22.760
 no, let's put the chair over there,

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:23.880
 let's get that over there.

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:25.160
 And apparently, according to her,

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:27.040
 they are the only animals apart from humans

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:28.760
 that radically transform their environment.

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:29.880
 So it's all about safety.

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:31.400
 They want the room perfect.

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:33.640
 So if you put a beaver in your room, it will be different.

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:35.520
 - And it will flood the room.

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:36.360
 - Yes.

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:37.200
 - Crucially.

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:38.280
 - What they do is they build the dams

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:41.360
 where they hear the water the most, right?

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:43.520
 'Cause they wanna find the narrow part of the river

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:44.860
 where the water's really flowing.

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:46.960
 So they listen out for loud water.

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:48.080
 When they find the loud water,

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:49.720
 that's where they build their dams.

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:51.120
 But if you get a tape recorder

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:52.600
 and put it in the middle of the room,

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:54.000
 and put a beaver in there,

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.760
 they'll go around finding any bits and pieces in the room

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:59.200
 and then just put it all on top of the tape recorder.

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:01.040
 - Yeah, that's cool. - That's very cool.

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:02.400
 So they make dams,

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:04.760
 and this can help to clean the water,

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:06.320
 can it, in rivers.

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:07.560
 The ones in the River Otter,

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:10.040
 they store 24 million liters of water,

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:13.360
 which is the equivalent of 10 Olympic-sized swimming pools.

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:16.280
 And they reckon it could help our bills, our water bills,

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:17.480
 because they clean it,

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:19.720
 that means the water companies don't have to.

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:20.800
 (audience laughing)

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:23.720
 'Cause I did find that between November 2019

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:25.160
 and February 2020,

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:28.560
 sewage treatment works near Stoke illegally release sewage

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:31.480
 equivalent to 10 Olympic-sized swimming pools.

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:33.080
 So basically all those beavers

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:34.560
 just did the right amount of work

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:36.200
 to help that one sewage leak.

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:37.040
 - That's great.

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:39.400
 So they're the sort of water company's friend?

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:40.480
 - Yeah. - That's nice.

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:41.840
 I don't like them as much now.

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:43.080
 (audience laughing)

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:45.240
 - Do you know what a beaver deceiver is?

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:47.400
 - Um, is that like catfishing?

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:48.240
 - Is it like a...

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:49.400
 (audience laughing)

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:50.320
 Oh yeah.

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:52.280
 - So it's someone who tricks a beaver in some way

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:55.160
 into building them a dam for their own use though.

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:59.080
 - Basically you've got an area where you want to have beavers,

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:01.160
 but you don't want the area to be flooded.

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:03.640
 And so you allow them to build their dam,

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:05.320
 but then you might put a little pipe in it

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:06.760
 so the water can still go through,

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:08.600
 but they can still do their dam.

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:10.080
 And that's called a beaver deceiver.

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:11.120
 It's just nice to say.

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:11.960
 - Yeah.

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:14.160
 Was there ever a dog that was a beaver retriever?

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:16.680
 (audience laughing)

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:17.520
 I don't know.

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:18.960
 (audience laughing)

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:20.560
 - Hey, I read a sentence about beavers

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:22.960
 and I wasn't able to find anything more out about it.

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:24.720
 So I'm just saying it in case you guys did,

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:26.920
 but it was such a mysterious sentence in a review

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:28.080
 about a book on beavers.

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:32.000
 It said, "Beavers never walked backwards."

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:32.840
 (audience laughing)

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:33.680
 - Okay.

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:36.080
 - Did you read the next sentence in the review?

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:38.320
 - They eat their food twice.

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:39.320
 (audience laughing)

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:40.400
 - They do do that.

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:42.480
 - They cannot doggy paddle.

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:45.680
 They have ever growing orange teeth

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:47.480
 with which to gnaw woody plants.

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:50.520
 - Is this book review 10 weird facts about beavers?

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:52.000
 (audience laughing)

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.600
 - No, it's an amazing book about the point being made

00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:58.120
 that beavers, actually, they don't only make dams,

00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:00.640
 but they made America, effectively.

00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:04.240
 America's fortunes were effectively down to beavers.

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:05.440
 And it was fur trading.

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:07.480
 Beavers were virtually extinct over here, right?

00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:09.640
 Because they'd been hunted down, we'd used all the fur.

00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:11.240
 And then we found out that in North America,

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:12.600
 there were all these beavers there.

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:15.320
 So all the ships went over and started hunting them down.

00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:18.880
 And then you ended up with billionaires of beaver fur.

00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:19.960
 And it made America.

00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:23.320
 - I read that it literally created Canada,

00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:25.160
 beaver trade, basically.

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:27.920
 'Cause you had all the people on the East Coast,

00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:29.840
 and they needed to find more and more beavers.

00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:31.560
 And so they had to go inland and inland,

00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:34.440
 and they set up all these kind of trading posts

00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:36.280
 between all of the First Nations people.

00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:39.120
 And all those trading posts that came because of beaver pelts

00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:40.960
 was what became Canada in the end.

00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:43.480
 - Yeah, it's very hard to underestimate

00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:44.960
 how totally essential they were.

00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:47.800
 But when New York was sold to the Dutch

00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:49.000
 by the Native Americans,

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.240
 I read that actually it was mostly beaver pelts

00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:52.080
 that were sold.

00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:53.280
 And New York was like a little bonus.

00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:55.920
 They were like, "We'll sell you 2,000 beaver pelts.

00:07:55.920 --> 00:07:57.200
 And also we've got Manhattan as well.

00:07:57.200 --> 00:07:58.200
 Do you want this one too?"

00:07:58.200 --> 00:07:59.880
 And they were like, "Yeah, okay, toss it in."

00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:01.040
 But yeah, crucial.

00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:03.000
 And historically, it seems someone fair

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:03.960
 for such a crucial animal

00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:06.040
 that the main thing they're famous for

00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:08.000
 is taking off their testicles.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.400
 If you Google beavers, and their name--

00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:11.240
 - What?

00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:13.960
 - If you Google beavers with your safe search off.

00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:17.600
 You do get a lot of testicles that give you that.

00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:19.440
 - You wouldn't think testicles were the first thing.

00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:21.280
 - How did they take them off?

00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:22.800
 - Well, I mean, they didn't take them off at all.

00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:26.200
 But since ancient Greek, since Esop's fables,

00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:27.680
 there was this idea that beaver testicles

00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:29.480
 were very sought after, which they were,

00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:32.080
 for their medicinal qualities, which didn't exist.

00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:36.400
 And beavers figured out that if they tore off the testicles,

00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:37.440
 threw them at the hunter,

00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:40.120
 the hunter wouldn't chase after the beavers anymore.

00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:43.080
 The reason this came about is because they hide their testicles

00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:45.560
 behind this fleshy flap, the male beavers.

00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:46.400
 - Lovely.

00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:49.120
 - So, yes, I think fleshy flap is the term.

00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:51.440
 And so, people were like, where are their testicles?

00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:54.040
 They must have torn them off because of this reason.

00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:56.080
 But it's where the name comes from.

00:08:56.080 --> 00:08:59.480
 So castorium is the stuff they secrete.

00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:02.520
 Their name is castor in the Latin name.

00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:04.840
 And that's from castrated, same origin.

00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:06.840
 'Cause the idea was they ripped off their testicles.

00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:08.000
 - When I was kid in Bolton,

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:09.760
 we used to shout beaver in the streets.

00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:12.520
 If we ever saw anyone with a beard, you did beavering.

00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:13.960
 - This is so exciting.

00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:15.920
 - Literally, we would walk down the road

00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:17.600
 and there was someone with a beard

00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:21.040
 and the first person to spot them would shout beaver.

00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:21.880
 - Right.

00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:23.600
 - I read that this was a game popular

00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:25.680
 in the 1910s and 1920s.

00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:28.280
 (audience laughing)

00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:30.800
 - I believe that is the case in the rest of the country.

00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:32.280
 (audience laughing)

00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:33.840
 - What would beavering survive?

00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:36.440
 - What would the beaver do, what would they say?

00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:38.960
 - Well, they would be confused.

00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:40.720
 They would be like, that game hasn't been popular

00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:45.520
 since the 1920s and were there variations for you?

00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:46.360
 - I can't remember.

00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:48.000
 I was really young when it happened.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:49.880
 It wasn't literally in the 1920s,

00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:51.320
 but yeah, I was really young when it happened.

00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:53.360
 - 'Cause supposedly there were things like

00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:55.600
 if someone had a beard and a moustache,

00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:59.120
 that was a royal beaver or there was a king beaver,

00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:00.800
 which is a red, whiskered policeman

00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:02.360
 riding a green bicycle.

00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:04.000
 (audience laughing)

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:05.320
 And I just wondered if you knew the--

00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:06.720
 - No, I didn't know the nose.

00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:09.440
 But my theory is that the use of beaver

00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:13.040
 for women's genitals is from that game.

00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:14.520
 I'm pretty sure it is.

00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:18.400
 Because the first citation of that is from 1927.

00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:21.200
 And the citation in the Oxford English Dictionary says

00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:24.240
 she took off her clothes from her head to her toes

00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:27.240
 and the voice at the keyhole yelled beaver.

00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:28.640
 - Right.

00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:30.320
 - So it genuinely seems like that might be it.

00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:31.280
 - Yeah.

00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:33.600
 Well, I'll tell you what, Canada in 1920,

00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:35.240
 that was the year that what is now

00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:38.440
 their second oldest magazine ever was founded.

00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:40.080
 It was called The Beaver.

00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:43.640
 And it lasted all the way until 2010

00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:45.480
 until it needed to change its name,

00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:47.480
 which they've just changed to Canada's history.

00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:50.360
 And it was largely because none of their emails

00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:51.360
 were getting through to anyone

00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:53.840
 because they were being filtered out by foreign filters.

00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:54.680
 (audience laughing)

00:10:54.680 --> 00:10:56.960
 So all of their emails, all their newsletters,

00:10:56.960 --> 00:10:58.280
 nothing reaching it.

00:10:58.280 --> 00:11:00.120
 People were confused anyway about it.

00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:02.600
 - Same as Beaver College in Pennsylvania.

00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:03.440
 - Really?

00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:04.560
 - They changed their name because, again,

00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:06.440
 that no one could get to their website.

00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:09.080
 - Plus the applicants they got were questionable,

00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:10.120
 to say the least.

00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:11.160
 (laughing)

00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:12.440
 - So there wasn't an attempt before now

00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:14.120
 to reintroduce beavers to the UK

00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:16.600
 'cause I think there were some hundreds of thousands

00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:18.360
 in the Middle Ages.

00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:21.760
 Europe had about between 60 and 400 million beavers.

00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:23.360
 So I think that's a sign that no one really knows

00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:24.480
 how many there were.

00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:27.000
 But there were attempts to reintroduce them

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:28.160
 'cause they clung on a few,

00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:32.120
 and like really far Eastern sort of like central Asian step

00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:33.560
 that there were a few beavers knocking around.

00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:34.400
 - Right.

00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:36.560
 - And in the 1860s, there wasn't an attempt

00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:38.800
 to re-beaver in Suffolk and--

00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:40.480
 - Is that the technical term?

00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:41.320
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:42.160
 - To re-beaver.

00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:43.840
 - Re-beaver, yeah, yeah.

00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:45.760
 But they were de-beavered, they were destroyed.

00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:47.280
 (laughing)

00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:48.920
 And the very final ones, I just like this,

00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:51.560
 were sent to London to be stuffed by Lady Gooch.

00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:53.320
 (laughing)

00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:55.280
 - That sounds like another euphemism, doesn't it?

00:11:55.280 --> 00:11:57.400
 - How was that not your headline fact?

00:11:57.400 --> 00:11:58.840
 (laughing)

00:11:58.840 --> 00:12:01.400
 Beavers used to be stuffed by Lady Gooch.

00:12:01.400 --> 00:12:03.980
 (upbeat music)

00:12:03.980 --> 00:12:06.560
 (upbeat music)

00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:11.980
 - It is time for fact number two, and that is Anna.

00:12:11.980 --> 00:12:14.260
 - My fact this week is that in the 1600s,

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:17.820
 the Spanish ambassador to England had a specially made chair

00:12:17.820 --> 00:12:21.540
 with a hole in the bottom to accommodate his anal fistula.

00:12:21.540 --> 00:12:22.580
 (laughing)

00:12:22.580 --> 00:12:23.780
 - Wow, hmm.

00:12:23.780 --> 00:12:27.460
 - Yeah, this is such a good article that I read.

00:12:27.460 --> 00:12:29.860
 It was on history today, and it was about a play

00:12:29.860 --> 00:12:32.420
 called A Game at Chess, which is the most popular play

00:12:32.420 --> 00:12:33.820
 of the 1600s.

00:12:33.820 --> 00:12:35.220
 Most of you won't remember it.

00:12:35.220 --> 00:12:36.060
 The main--

00:12:36.060 --> 00:12:37.260
 - Still big in Bolton.

00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:39.260
 (laughing)

00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:42.940
 - The main villain in it is a guy called Diego Sarmiento

00:12:42.940 --> 00:12:47.020
 de Acuña, or Count Gondemar, who was the Spanish ambassador

00:12:47.020 --> 00:12:50.500
 to England between 1613 and 1622,

00:12:50.500 --> 00:12:54.980
 and he had an anal fistula that was very famous.

00:12:54.980 --> 00:12:56.460
 And I just think if you've got an anal fistula,

00:12:56.460 --> 00:12:57.500
 you don't want it to be famous.

00:12:57.500 --> 00:12:59.380
 It impacted his movement, and--

00:12:59.380 --> 00:13:02.420
 - It's hard to say how famous it was, isn't it?

00:13:02.420 --> 00:13:05.180
 - Right, literally everyone in the country knew about it.

00:13:05.180 --> 00:13:08.020
 - Their posters on their bedroom wall, it was--

00:13:08.020 --> 00:13:09.980
 - But how many people can even name

00:13:09.980 --> 00:13:11.540
 the Spanish ambassador now?

00:13:11.540 --> 00:13:14.060
 It's a job that has undergone a huge decline in prestige

00:13:14.060 --> 00:13:15.100
 in the last 400 years.

00:13:15.100 --> 00:13:15.940
 - Right.

00:13:15.940 --> 00:13:17.460
 - Yeah, it's since we weren't at war with Spain anymore.

00:13:17.460 --> 00:13:18.300
 - Exactly.

00:13:18.300 --> 00:13:19.140
 - Yeah.

00:13:19.140 --> 00:13:20.620
 - Exactly, but I just think that's really tragic.

00:13:20.620 --> 00:13:21.460
 I looked up the current--

00:13:21.460 --> 00:13:22.780
 - We're not at war with Spain anymore?

00:13:22.780 --> 00:13:23.620
 (laughing)

00:13:23.620 --> 00:13:25.580
 - I'm willing to say, "Wow, come and have a go."

00:13:25.580 --> 00:13:27.300
 (laughing)

00:13:27.300 --> 00:13:30.940
 Well, no, I just think it's as in,

00:13:30.940 --> 00:13:32.820
 I looked up the Spanish ambassador to the UK earlier.

00:13:32.820 --> 00:13:34.220
 I've forgotten his name.

00:13:34.220 --> 00:13:35.220
 - Right, yeah.

00:13:35.220 --> 00:13:37.060
 - It's definitely Spanish, but I just mean--

00:13:37.060 --> 00:13:37.900
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:13:37.900 --> 00:13:38.740
 - I think it's a shame for him.

00:13:38.740 --> 00:13:40.460
 And when you say an anal fistula,

00:13:40.460 --> 00:13:43.020
 I actually would like a quick sense check on what that is,

00:13:43.020 --> 00:13:44.460
 because I like the way you said in your fact,

00:13:44.460 --> 00:13:46.820
 his chair had a hole in the bottom,

00:13:46.820 --> 00:13:47.700
 because as far as I can tell,

00:13:47.700 --> 00:13:49.780
 that is what one of those is, right?

00:13:49.780 --> 00:13:51.100
 (laughing)

00:13:51.100 --> 00:13:52.740
 But it's a sort of extra hole in the bottom.

00:13:52.740 --> 00:13:53.740
 - Yeah, it's one too many.

00:13:53.740 --> 00:13:54.580
 - Right.

00:13:54.580 --> 00:13:55.400
 - Right.

00:13:55.400 --> 00:13:57.300
 - A fistula is a hole basically between two tubes.

00:13:57.300 --> 00:13:58.140
 - Yeah.

00:13:58.140 --> 00:13:58.980
 - It's a gap where there shouldn't be a gap.

00:13:58.980 --> 00:13:59.820
 - Yeah.

00:13:59.820 --> 00:14:01.180
 - The hole in the bottom of the chair

00:14:01.180 --> 00:14:02.980
 was not 'cause he had something hanging out

00:14:02.980 --> 00:14:04.420
 that had to drop through it,

00:14:04.420 --> 00:14:05.940
 which is kind of what you assume, I think,

00:14:05.940 --> 00:14:07.340
 when you hear me say that.

00:14:07.340 --> 00:14:10.260
 It's because it would be so sensitive and painful.

00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:11.660
 And he also had to be carried through the streets

00:14:11.660 --> 00:14:12.820
 of London on a sedan chair,

00:14:12.820 --> 00:14:14.140
 'cause everyone hated him so much

00:14:14.140 --> 00:14:16.140
 that they would attack him if he was carried,

00:14:16.140 --> 00:14:16.980
 you know, if he walked.

00:14:16.980 --> 00:14:17.820
 - Really?

00:14:17.820 --> 00:14:18.660
 - Plus it was quite hard to walk with a fistula.

00:14:18.660 --> 00:14:21.180
 - Well, like kick him in the bum kind of thing, as a--

00:14:21.180 --> 00:14:22.900
 - I think that would probably be one of the tactics, yeah.

00:14:22.900 --> 00:14:23.740
 - Yeah.

00:14:23.740 --> 00:14:25.060
 - Surely something to make you less likable

00:14:25.060 --> 00:14:26.940
 is having yourself carried through the streets of London

00:14:26.940 --> 00:14:28.260
 in a sedan chair.

00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:31.820
 - Surely just wear a hat and go out and just...

00:14:31.820 --> 00:14:34.220
 - When you say it doesn't, a secret...

00:14:34.220 --> 00:14:35.060
 - No.

00:14:35.060 --> 00:14:35.900
 - Well, it does.

00:14:35.900 --> 00:14:37.860
 I mean, it does, and it is an unpleasant condition.

00:14:37.860 --> 00:14:41.020
 - But not feces, it doesn't act as a second bum hole.

00:14:41.020 --> 00:14:41.860
 It acts as a second bum hole.

00:14:41.860 --> 00:14:42.700
 - Yeah, yeah, of course.

00:14:42.700 --> 00:14:45.340
 Because basically it's caused by some sort of infection.

00:14:45.340 --> 00:14:46.740
 Sorry for the gory details,

00:14:46.740 --> 00:14:49.260
 but it's important to know if you have one.

00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:52.100
 An infection somewhere in the anal tract,

00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:53.780
 and there's a bunch of pus builds up,

00:14:53.780 --> 00:14:55.460
 and then when it goes away, it leaves a little tunnel

00:14:55.460 --> 00:14:58.220
 that goes from the anal tract out of the sort of button.

00:14:58.220 --> 00:14:59.180
 Right near the bum hole,

00:14:59.180 --> 00:15:01.900
 and so it will leak things from your bow.

00:15:01.900 --> 00:15:04.500
 - Most of my stuff is about Spanish foreign policy.

00:15:04.500 --> 00:15:05.340
 - Right.

00:15:05.340 --> 00:15:06.900
 (audience laughing)

00:15:06.900 --> 00:15:08.780
 - Do you guys remember when my wife, Fenella,

00:15:08.780 --> 00:15:11.380
 thought that my oldest son, Will, had a second bum hole?

00:15:11.380 --> 00:15:12.620
 (audience laughing)

00:15:12.620 --> 00:15:13.540
 - No.

00:15:13.540 --> 00:15:16.060
 It was in the first few weeks after he had been born.

00:15:16.060 --> 00:15:17.180
 It was our first child,

00:15:17.180 --> 00:15:19.740
 and you have to change the nappy every few hours, right?

00:15:19.740 --> 00:15:21.500
 So you're getting up at like two a.m., four a.m.

00:15:21.500 --> 00:15:23.220
 I got up at like two or four,

00:15:23.220 --> 00:15:24.340
 and I was going to change the nappy,

00:15:24.340 --> 00:15:25.380
 and Fenella said to me,

00:15:25.380 --> 00:15:27.140
 "Don't forget to wipe a second bum."

00:15:27.140 --> 00:15:28.740
 And I said, "Excuse me?"

00:15:28.740 --> 00:15:31.940
 And she said, "His second bum hole, don't forget so,

00:15:31.940 --> 00:15:34.460
 "because it could get infected if you don't wipe it properly."

00:15:34.460 --> 00:15:36.020
 And I said, "What do you mean?"

00:15:36.020 --> 00:15:37.660
 And basically newborn babies,

00:15:37.660 --> 00:15:39.700
 they have a little dent that's right at the top,

00:15:39.700 --> 00:15:42.460
 but she thought that that was an actual other bum hole.

00:15:42.460 --> 00:15:45.020
 This is how tired and sleep deprived she was.

00:15:45.020 --> 00:15:47.020
 - What did she think was going to happen to this

00:15:47.020 --> 00:15:47.940
 in the fullness of time?

00:15:47.940 --> 00:15:49.380
 Does she think there are people walking

00:15:49.380 --> 00:15:50.580
 among us who have this?

00:15:50.580 --> 00:15:52.140
 - I said to her, I was like,

00:15:52.140 --> 00:15:53.500
 "How did you think that was possible?"

00:15:53.500 --> 00:15:55.260
 And she was like, "I don't know how boys work.

00:15:55.260 --> 00:15:56.500
 "I don't know what you have."

00:15:56.500 --> 00:15:58.100
 (audience laughing)

00:15:58.100 --> 00:15:58.940
 - That's fair.

00:15:58.940 --> 00:15:59.940
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:15:59.940 --> 00:16:02.860
 - So the Spanish in the 1600s,

00:16:02.860 --> 00:16:05.140
 (audience laughing)

00:16:05.140 --> 00:16:06.980
 they had been at war with Britain,

00:16:06.980 --> 00:16:08.780
 or with England, I should say.

00:16:08.780 --> 00:16:12.380
 And this guy, Gondama, who was the ambassador,

00:16:12.380 --> 00:16:14.300
 he'd come to the English court

00:16:14.300 --> 00:16:17.220
 and he'd become really best friends with King James.

00:16:17.220 --> 00:16:18.740
 They were super close.

00:16:18.740 --> 00:16:20.020
 And because they were so close,

00:16:20.020 --> 00:16:23.860
 he started making James do lots of policies

00:16:23.860 --> 00:16:25.700
 that were very pro-Spanish.

00:16:25.700 --> 00:16:27.980
 And it eventually came to the extent

00:16:27.980 --> 00:16:31.540
 where he forced James to execute Walter Raleigh,

00:16:31.540 --> 00:16:33.820
 because so Walter Raleigh had been a pirate

00:16:33.820 --> 00:16:36.260
 and attacking some Spanish ships.

00:16:36.260 --> 00:16:37.620
 And he said, "Well, we're gonna go to war

00:16:37.620 --> 00:16:39.140
 "unless you execute him."

00:16:39.140 --> 00:16:41.220
 James first said, "Okay, fine, you're my best mate.

00:16:41.220 --> 00:16:42.340
 "I will do it."

00:16:42.340 --> 00:16:43.940
 And then obviously, everyone hated him

00:16:43.940 --> 00:16:44.780
 from that moment.

00:16:44.780 --> 00:16:45.740
 - It's just incredible.

00:16:45.740 --> 00:16:47.900
 - Yeah, the Spanish ambassador has the power

00:16:47.900 --> 00:16:48.940
 to ask the king.

00:16:48.940 --> 00:16:50.860
 - Well, we don't know that he did.

00:16:50.860 --> 00:16:53.220
 - Imagine if King Charles executed Alan Titchmarsh

00:16:53.220 --> 00:16:57.620
 on the orders of whoever the Spanish ambassador is now.

00:16:57.620 --> 00:16:59.540
 I was just trying to think of a beloved national figure,

00:16:59.540 --> 00:17:00.940
 like a national figurehead.

00:17:00.940 --> 00:17:03.900
 - Alan Titchmarsh isn't attacking Spanish possessions.

00:17:03.900 --> 00:17:06.220
 At most, he's buying up some Spanish plants.

00:17:06.220 --> 00:17:08.740
 - Okay, it's a bad example.

00:17:08.740 --> 00:17:10.020
 - Did you guys read the account

00:17:10.020 --> 00:17:11.740
 of the execution of Walter Raleigh?

00:17:11.740 --> 00:17:12.580
 - No.

00:17:12.580 --> 00:17:13.820
 - That's sort of alluded to.

00:17:13.820 --> 00:17:14.860
 He was incredibly popular.

00:17:14.860 --> 00:17:17.260
 He was like the fanciable, you know,

00:17:17.260 --> 00:17:19.100
 Clive Owen or whatever of his day.

00:17:19.100 --> 00:17:22.740
 And PR-wise, he nailed the execution.

00:17:22.740 --> 00:17:25.180
 So it was pretty dodgy grounds

00:17:25.180 --> 00:17:27.820
 on which he was sentenced to death for treason.

00:17:27.820 --> 00:17:28.820
 The morning of his execution,

00:17:28.820 --> 00:17:30.140
 he had this huge breakfast.

00:17:30.140 --> 00:17:31.380
 He was puffing on his pipe.

00:17:31.380 --> 00:17:32.340
 He had a glass of wine.

00:17:32.340 --> 00:17:34.020
 He made a joke about it.

00:17:34.020 --> 00:17:36.140
 He went up to the scaffold and he said,

00:17:36.140 --> 00:17:38.180
 "Sorry, do you mind if I just say a few words

00:17:38.180 --> 00:17:39.180
 "at the scaffold?"

00:17:39.180 --> 00:17:41.980
 He made a 25-minute speech.

00:17:41.980 --> 00:17:44.900
 Full of sort of charm and laughs and warmth.

00:17:44.900 --> 00:17:47.420
 At one point, he sensed that the nobles on the balcony

00:17:47.420 --> 00:17:48.540
 couldn't hear him properly.

00:17:48.540 --> 00:17:50.900
 And so he invited them all onto the scaffold with him

00:17:50.900 --> 00:17:52.620
 and started the speech again.

00:17:52.620 --> 00:17:54.780
 So that they could hear it properly.

00:17:54.780 --> 00:17:56.580
 And he shook all of their hands, saying,

00:17:56.580 --> 00:17:58.860
 "Hello, how are you, how's your wife?"

00:17:58.860 --> 00:17:59.700
 All of that.

00:17:59.700 --> 00:18:00.940
 At one point, the sheriff said,

00:18:00.940 --> 00:18:02.780
 "Do you want to come and warm yourself by the fire

00:18:02.780 --> 00:18:04.420
 "while you give this speech?"

00:18:04.420 --> 00:18:06.860
 And he said, "No, I'm getting a bit sick,

00:18:06.860 --> 00:18:09.460
 "so I want to get this over with before I get ill again."

00:18:09.460 --> 00:18:12.740
 And then he apologized to his executioner

00:18:12.740 --> 00:18:14.420
 for going on so long.

00:18:14.420 --> 00:18:16.500
 And then popped his head under the ax and went.

00:18:16.500 --> 00:18:17.820
 - Really? - Which, you know,

00:18:17.820 --> 00:18:19.060
 if you're going to go and style.

00:18:19.060 --> 00:18:20.300
 - It does feel like he was leading up

00:18:20.300 --> 00:18:21.740
 to something incredibly clever.

00:18:21.740 --> 00:18:23.220
 - That's the shame of it.

00:18:23.220 --> 00:18:25.620
 - You know, one person who, I was trying to,

00:18:25.620 --> 00:18:27.860
 I was really hoping there was a Wikipedia article

00:18:27.860 --> 00:18:30.300
 which was notable people with anal fistulas.

00:18:30.300 --> 00:18:32.140
 And it wasn't, it wasn't there.

00:18:32.140 --> 00:18:34.100
 It's kind of the thing Wiki sometimes has.

00:18:34.100 --> 00:18:36.300
 But one person, if the page did exist,

00:18:36.300 --> 00:18:38.540
 that would belong on there, is Charles Dickens.

00:18:38.540 --> 00:18:39.380
 - Oh.

00:18:39.380 --> 00:18:40.740
 - Dickens had a fistula.

00:18:40.740 --> 00:18:41.580
 - Interesting.

00:18:41.580 --> 00:18:44.220
 - Yeah, and he had it very early on in his career.

00:18:44.220 --> 00:18:46.620
 And there's an argument that had it not

00:18:46.620 --> 00:18:49.220
 had been sorted out by a pioneering doctor at the time,

00:18:49.220 --> 00:18:51.540
 who was called Frederick Salmon,

00:18:51.540 --> 00:18:54.020
 then we might not have had all the subsequent books

00:18:54.020 --> 00:18:56.860
 that he wrote because he was so debilitated by it.

00:18:56.860 --> 00:18:59.300
 He used to have to dictate to his then wife

00:18:59.300 --> 00:19:00.540
 and she would write down.

00:19:00.540 --> 00:19:02.180
 But he couldn't, he just couldn't think properly

00:19:02.180 --> 00:19:03.300
 with all that going on.

00:19:03.300 --> 00:19:04.860
 So this guy, Frederick Salmon,

00:19:04.860 --> 00:19:06.940
 because it was a dangerous operation back in the day.

00:19:06.940 --> 00:19:07.940
 This guy was amazing.

00:19:07.940 --> 00:19:09.820
 He set up his hospital, which was called

00:19:09.820 --> 00:19:11.620
 the Infirmary for Relief of the Poor,

00:19:11.620 --> 00:19:15.580
 afflicted with fistulas and the diseases of the rectum.

00:19:15.580 --> 00:19:16.620
 It was called that until someone said,

00:19:16.620 --> 00:19:17.940
 why don't we just call it St. Mark's?

00:19:17.940 --> 00:19:19.140
 They changed it to that.

00:19:19.140 --> 00:19:20.060
 (audience laughing)

00:19:20.060 --> 00:19:23.300
 And he carried out over 3,500 operations,

00:19:23.300 --> 00:19:24.540
 one of which was Dickens.

00:19:24.540 --> 00:19:25.900
 And as a result, he was fixed.

00:19:25.900 --> 00:19:28.380
 And then he went on to being able to sit down

00:19:28.380 --> 00:19:29.220
 and write his book.

00:19:29.220 --> 00:19:30.060
 - That's great.

00:19:30.060 --> 00:19:31.420
 - And Dickens, in those days, no NHS.

00:19:31.420 --> 00:19:33.060
 So he had to pay for his operation.

00:19:33.060 --> 00:19:34.340
 And he paid for his operation

00:19:34.340 --> 00:19:37.300
 with several autographed copies of the Pickwick papers.

00:19:37.300 --> 00:19:39.340
 - Hmm, they've not accepted

00:19:39.340 --> 00:19:42.620
 impossible things as payment at my private doctors.

00:19:42.620 --> 00:19:45.460
 - The most famous surgeon of fistulas

00:19:45.460 --> 00:19:48.580
 in the 18th century was Martin Van Butchel.

00:19:48.580 --> 00:19:49.420
 He was--

00:19:49.420 --> 00:19:52.340
 - That's very, very disconcerting for the patients.

00:19:52.340 --> 00:19:54.380
 - Well, he would put loads of adverts on.

00:19:54.380 --> 00:19:56.060
 He had amazing advertising.

00:19:56.060 --> 00:19:57.940
 He was most famous 'cause he enjoyed riding

00:19:57.940 --> 00:20:00.100
 around Hyde Park on a white pony,

00:20:00.100 --> 00:20:02.380
 which he often painted purple.

00:20:02.380 --> 00:20:03.220
 - Oh.

00:20:03.220 --> 00:20:04.060
 (audience laughing)

00:20:04.060 --> 00:20:05.340
 - And he had a really long beard

00:20:05.340 --> 00:20:08.420
 and he always carried a large white bone around with him.

00:20:08.420 --> 00:20:09.260
 - Bone?

00:20:09.260 --> 00:20:10.100
 - Bone.

00:20:10.100 --> 00:20:11.820
 You know, like Fred Flintstone might.

00:20:11.820 --> 00:20:13.220
 - Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:20:13.220 --> 00:20:14.820
 - And his wife died.

00:20:14.820 --> 00:20:16.500
 She was killed by the Nazis, actually.

00:20:16.500 --> 00:20:19.140
 Well, she died in 1775.

00:20:19.140 --> 00:20:19.980
 - Yeah.

00:20:19.980 --> 00:20:22.300
 - And Butchel asked his friend, John Hunter,

00:20:22.300 --> 00:20:24.020
 to preserve the body.

00:20:24.020 --> 00:20:25.940
 And then he put the body on display

00:20:25.940 --> 00:20:29.380
 as kind of advertising for his fistula company.

00:20:29.380 --> 00:20:33.300
 - Lot of questionable decisions being made in this.

00:20:33.300 --> 00:20:35.180
 - The body was described soon afterwards

00:20:35.180 --> 00:20:37.340
 as a repulsive looking object.

00:20:37.340 --> 00:20:38.820
 And eventually he had to get rid of it

00:20:38.820 --> 00:20:40.540
 when his second wife objected.

00:20:40.540 --> 00:20:43.080
 - Oh, that is fussy.

00:20:43.080 --> 00:20:45.020
 (audience laughing)

00:20:45.020 --> 00:20:47.420
 - His wife's preserved corpse was on display

00:20:47.420 --> 00:20:50.600
 in the college in Lincoln's Infields

00:20:50.600 --> 00:20:54.180
 until 1941 when it was bombed by the Nazis.

00:20:54.180 --> 00:20:55.020
 - Ah.

00:20:55.020 --> 00:20:56.460
 - It was not the target.

00:20:56.460 --> 00:20:57.460
 (audience laughing)

00:20:57.460 --> 00:20:58.980
 - It's too creepy.

00:20:58.980 --> 00:21:00.320
 Get rid of it.

00:21:00.320 --> 00:21:02.380
 - This play, by the way, is so fascinating

00:21:02.380 --> 00:21:03.940
 because it was 1600s.

00:21:03.940 --> 00:21:05.500
 This was performed at the Globe.

00:21:05.500 --> 00:21:08.440
 Like this was the original Shakespearean theater.

00:21:08.440 --> 00:21:11.420
 And the play itself, the plot is amazing.

00:21:11.420 --> 00:21:13.100
 It was literally as if you were watching

00:21:13.100 --> 00:21:14.820
 a live game of chess, right?

00:21:14.820 --> 00:21:16.120
 - Yeah, and the play, this is the play

00:21:16.120 --> 00:21:17.540
 that took the piss out of Condomard.

00:21:17.540 --> 00:21:18.580
 - Yes, exactly.

00:21:18.580 --> 00:21:20.420
 And so when the play started,

00:21:20.420 --> 00:21:23.140
 people very quickly realized that this was a satire

00:21:23.140 --> 00:21:24.700
 of the ambassador.

00:21:24.700 --> 00:21:26.620
 And so they had to get word to the king

00:21:26.620 --> 00:21:27.780
 in order to ban it.

00:21:27.780 --> 00:21:30.260
 And they specifically put this play on at a point

00:21:30.260 --> 00:21:31.420
 when the king went away.

00:21:31.420 --> 00:21:33.660
 So it took about nine days to get to him.

00:21:33.660 --> 00:21:35.500
 So multiple performances were happening.

00:21:35.500 --> 00:21:36.980
 They couldn't stop it from happening.

00:21:36.980 --> 00:21:38.820
 So it was such a hit job

00:21:38.820 --> 00:21:40.340
 and it was done in Shakespeare's Globe.

00:21:40.340 --> 00:21:41.860
 - And it was massively popular.

00:21:41.860 --> 00:21:42.700
 It's mad.

00:21:42.700 --> 00:21:44.260
 - Everyone got the allegory.

00:21:44.260 --> 00:21:46.300
 A seventh of the population of London

00:21:46.300 --> 00:21:47.880
 saw it in nine days.

00:21:47.880 --> 00:21:49.980
 The chess piece, which I think was the Black Knight

00:21:49.980 --> 00:21:51.700
 who represented Condomard,

00:21:51.700 --> 00:21:54.420
 was referred to as the fistula of Europe

00:21:54.420 --> 00:21:55.680
 during the play.

00:21:55.680 --> 00:22:00.260
 And 50 years later, in the 1660s or 1670s,

00:22:00.260 --> 00:22:02.740
 people were still referring to the fistula of Europe

00:22:02.740 --> 00:22:04.540
 and everyone knew what they meant.

00:22:04.540 --> 00:22:05.380
 - Right.

00:22:05.380 --> 00:22:06.220
 - Imagine that.

00:22:06.220 --> 00:22:07.040
 - Did he see it?

00:22:07.040 --> 00:22:07.880
 Was he there?

00:22:07.880 --> 00:22:08.720
 - I don't think he was.

00:22:08.720 --> 00:22:11.100
 I think he had retired as ambassador by that point.

00:22:11.100 --> 00:22:13.220
 It was his successor as ambassador,

00:22:13.220 --> 00:22:15.740
 who was a guy called Coloma who complained about it.

00:22:15.740 --> 00:22:17.580
 The play has a lot of scatological humor

00:22:17.580 --> 00:22:20.460
 and it has a lot of rude, wind-based puns.

00:22:20.460 --> 00:22:22.540
 And I was reading an article analyzing the play

00:22:22.540 --> 00:22:25.340
 in a book called "Theatre in Post-Reformation London."

00:22:25.340 --> 00:22:27.020
 And I just want to read you this sentence,

00:22:27.020 --> 00:22:28.860
 which I just really liked,

00:22:28.860 --> 00:22:31.260
 to adapt Anton, oh, so by the way,

00:22:31.260 --> 00:22:32.800
 they bring on his fake seat.

00:22:32.800 --> 00:22:34.260
 They bring on the fistula seat,

00:22:34.260 --> 00:22:35.780
 which looks exactly like a loose seat.

00:22:35.780 --> 00:22:36.620
 That's the thing.

00:22:36.620 --> 00:22:37.580
 Here's the line.

00:22:37.580 --> 00:22:39.780
 To adapt Anton Chekhov's maxim

00:22:39.780 --> 00:22:43.020
 that when a gun is introduced into a play, it must be fired.

00:22:43.020 --> 00:22:46.540
 I propose that when a toilet is brought on stage,

00:22:46.540 --> 00:22:48.100
 there must be farts.

00:22:48.100 --> 00:22:49.900
 (audience laughing)

00:22:49.900 --> 00:22:50.740
 - Lovely.

00:22:50.740 --> 00:22:51.580
 - Who would've thought?

00:22:51.580 --> 00:22:52.780
 He sounds very sinister, Condomar.

00:22:52.780 --> 00:22:54.060
 He does, I mean, in all, you know,

00:22:54.060 --> 00:22:55.820
 it would like titch my stuff aside.

00:22:55.820 --> 00:22:58.500
 I think he does sound, he tried to intimidate people.

00:22:58.500 --> 00:23:00.620
 He had himself painted as Machiavelli.

00:23:00.620 --> 00:23:02.500
 - But apparently Machiavellian wasn't a word

00:23:02.500 --> 00:23:03.740
 that was used to describe someone

00:23:03.740 --> 00:23:05.280
 who was Machiavellian until him.

00:23:05.280 --> 00:23:06.600
 So that got applied to him.

00:23:06.600 --> 00:23:08.100
 And then everyone was like, that's a great term.

00:23:08.100 --> 00:23:10.340
 - We use that for other things now.

00:23:10.340 --> 00:23:11.980
 So he's done good things as well, right?

00:23:11.980 --> 00:23:14.220
 - He married his niece.

00:23:14.220 --> 00:23:16.140
 He's done great things, as one tried to say.

00:23:16.140 --> 00:23:18.720
 He married his niece and then his cousin.

00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:20.020
 He definitely had a type.

00:23:20.020 --> 00:23:22.640
 (audience laughing)

00:23:22.640 --> 00:23:24.040
 - Yeah, that's terrible.

00:23:24.040 --> 00:23:26.460
 - No, that's not that close.

00:23:26.460 --> 00:23:27.300
 - His niece?

00:23:27.300 --> 00:23:29.020
 - His niece is pretty close, I know.

00:23:29.020 --> 00:23:31.240
 - It was the 1500s, if you do 1600s,

00:23:31.240 --> 00:23:34.100
 if you didn't marry a niece, you're a weirdo.

00:23:34.100 --> 00:23:35.900
 - How is your uncle, by the way?

00:23:35.900 --> 00:23:37.340
 (audience laughing)

00:23:37.340 --> 00:23:40.060
 - My four-legged child is doing very well as well.

00:23:40.060 --> 00:23:40.900
 Thank you.

00:23:40.900 --> 00:23:41.740
 (audience laughing)

00:23:41.740 --> 00:23:42.900
 - Bubbles from here to breakfast.

00:23:42.900 --> 00:23:45.140
 (audience laughing)

00:23:45.140 --> 00:23:47.720
 (upbeat music)

00:23:47.720 --> 00:23:55.140
 - It is time for fact number three, and that is James.

00:23:55.140 --> 00:23:59.100
 - Okay, my fact this week is that in 1930s Canada,

00:23:59.100 --> 00:24:02.220
 the Mounties dealt with illegal nudists

00:24:02.220 --> 00:24:05.180
 by covering them in itching powder.

00:24:05.180 --> 00:24:08.820
 That is a very, how did they get close enough to apply,

00:24:08.820 --> 00:24:11.260
 as in the Mounties or on horseback, I think of them as?

00:24:11.260 --> 00:24:13.700
 - That's the Mountie part of them, the Mounted.

00:24:13.700 --> 00:24:15.820
 - Did they just scatter it?

00:24:15.820 --> 00:24:17.620
 - Yeah, I think they threw it.

00:24:17.620 --> 00:24:22.620
 This was the Dukobas who were a group of 7,500 Russians

00:24:22.620 --> 00:24:26.060
 who arrived in Canada 'cause they'd been persecuted

00:24:26.060 --> 00:24:29.420
 in Russia, and there was a small group of them

00:24:29.420 --> 00:24:31.900
 who insisted on going naked all the time,

00:24:31.900 --> 00:24:33.940
 kind of for their religion.

00:24:33.940 --> 00:24:35.620
 They kind of thought it was getting closer

00:24:35.620 --> 00:24:37.620
 to Adam and Eve and all that kind of stuff,

00:24:37.620 --> 00:24:40.800
 and going naked was also a way to protest,

00:24:40.800 --> 00:24:42.780
 so they didn't really want their children

00:24:42.780 --> 00:24:45.580
 to go to the state schools, but they were forced to do so,

00:24:45.580 --> 00:24:47.140
 and so they went naked.

00:24:47.140 --> 00:24:49.820
 - Obviously, the obvious protest against not wanting

00:24:49.820 --> 00:24:51.820
 your children to go to the state school,

00:24:51.820 --> 00:24:53.860
 they wanted to keep in their communal living,

00:24:53.860 --> 00:24:56.260
 they didn't want to be forced into state housing,

00:24:56.260 --> 00:24:59.940
 so they went naked, and even if their own leaders

00:24:59.940 --> 00:25:02.220
 did things that they didn't really like, they went naked.

00:25:02.220 --> 00:25:06.260
 And the Canadian government decided this is not a good idea,

00:25:06.260 --> 00:25:09.940
 so not only did they do this thing with the itching powder,

00:25:09.940 --> 00:25:12.860
 but eventually, just due to what was happening here,

00:25:12.860 --> 00:25:17.060
 the Canadian parliament outlawed public nudity in 1932

00:25:17.060 --> 00:25:19.100
 as a result of the Dukobas.

00:25:19.100 --> 00:25:19.940
 - Yeah, right.

00:25:19.940 --> 00:25:24.060
 - Itching powder is more of a schoolboy 1940s prank thing

00:25:24.060 --> 00:25:26.620
 than a kind of legally imposed thing.

00:25:26.620 --> 00:25:28.020
 Do we know what the itching powder was?

00:25:28.020 --> 00:25:29.420
 Was it the old rose hips?

00:25:29.420 --> 00:25:31.340
 - Yeah, I don't know which one it was.

00:25:31.340 --> 00:25:32.820
 I suspect it was rose hips,

00:25:32.820 --> 00:25:34.940
 just thinking about where they are.

00:25:34.940 --> 00:25:36.780
 - 'Cause it's not that bad a punishment, is it?

00:25:36.780 --> 00:25:38.020
 Especially if you're naked.

00:25:38.020 --> 00:25:39.580
 I think the worst is when it gets in your clothes.

00:25:39.580 --> 00:25:40.940
 - Well, you're just trying to deter people, right?

00:25:40.940 --> 00:25:42.900
 Like, we've spoken about this on the podcast before,

00:25:42.900 --> 00:25:46.740
 where it was used by Churchill's brain box

00:25:46.740 --> 00:25:47.580
 where they were coming.

00:25:47.580 --> 00:25:49.940
 You know, all these amazing ideas they were coming up with

00:25:49.940 --> 00:25:51.900
 that would subtly get to the Nazis,

00:25:51.900 --> 00:25:53.660
 they were putting it in their clothes,

00:25:53.660 --> 00:25:55.300
 they were putting it in their condoms,

00:25:55.300 --> 00:25:56.340
 they were just itching powder.

00:25:56.340 --> 00:25:57.980
 - These were things that were tried in the Second World War.

00:25:57.980 --> 00:25:58.820
 - Yeah, exactly.

00:25:58.820 --> 00:26:01.020
 Like, it's just, it's a deterrent, isn't it?

00:26:01.020 --> 00:26:02.100
 And...

00:26:02.100 --> 00:26:03.700
 - That's why we won the war.

00:26:03.700 --> 00:26:05.860
 Itching powder in the condoms.

00:26:05.860 --> 00:26:07.780
 - The condom thing is quite clever, isn't it?

00:26:07.780 --> 00:26:09.900
 Because you put your itching powder in the condoms

00:26:09.900 --> 00:26:11.660
 and they get itchy down below

00:26:11.660 --> 00:26:13.700
 and they think, well, I must have lice

00:26:13.700 --> 00:26:16.740
 or I must have an STD or something like that.

00:26:16.740 --> 00:26:19.260
 And quite often, if a lot of people in a platoon

00:26:19.260 --> 00:26:20.100
 got an STD,

00:26:20.100 --> 00:26:22.380
 then they were all kind of taken away from the front.

00:26:22.380 --> 00:26:23.220
 - Really?

00:26:23.220 --> 00:26:26.220
 - So I did read, I was on the website powderbolksolids.com,

00:26:26.220 --> 00:26:28.300
 which is a great guide to historical powders.

00:26:28.300 --> 00:26:31.740
 And they mentioned especially the itching powder

00:26:31.740 --> 00:26:35.580
 was smuggled into Germany

00:26:35.580 --> 00:26:39.540
 and particularly into the uniforms of the German army.

00:26:39.540 --> 00:26:41.980
 So, particularly the Navy as well.

00:26:41.980 --> 00:26:44.020
 So there was at least one U-boat

00:26:44.020 --> 00:26:46.340
 had to turn around and come home

00:26:46.340 --> 00:26:49.460
 because everyone on board was just itching so much.

00:26:49.460 --> 00:26:51.660
 - And again, they just assumed it was fleas.

00:26:51.660 --> 00:26:52.500
 - Yeah, of course.

00:26:52.500 --> 00:26:54.300
 - So you're in a submarine, you're itching so much,

00:26:54.300 --> 00:26:55.980
 you think we must have a flea outbreak here,

00:26:55.980 --> 00:26:57.740
 we're gonna have to go back to land,

00:26:57.740 --> 00:27:00.340
 clean all our clothes, but actually it was itching powder.

00:27:00.340 --> 00:27:02.740
 - Oh, there was itching powder for trains as well

00:27:02.740 --> 00:27:03.780
 in the Second World War.

00:27:03.780 --> 00:27:04.860
 That was the thing you could do.

00:27:04.860 --> 00:27:05.700
 - So what would you do?

00:27:05.700 --> 00:27:07.660
 - It was a special powder called carburandum.

00:27:07.660 --> 00:27:08.660
 It was incredibly fine.

00:27:08.660 --> 00:27:10.500
 And if you mix it with lubricating oil,

00:27:10.500 --> 00:27:12.980
 it basically gums up an entire engine.

00:27:12.980 --> 00:27:14.500
 It's a really, really effective way

00:27:14.500 --> 00:27:17.980
 of just jamming a machine to a stop, effectively.

00:27:17.980 --> 00:27:18.940
 - Is that itching?

00:27:18.940 --> 00:27:20.860
 How is that itching?

00:27:20.860 --> 00:27:23.500
 - Well, it's, you know, I imagine the trains,

00:27:23.500 --> 00:27:25.500
 I imagine the train would feel pretty itchy after that.

00:27:25.500 --> 00:27:27.380
 - That's the train equivalent of itching.

00:27:27.380 --> 00:27:28.940
 - It's the train equivalent of itching, that's so fascinating.

00:27:28.940 --> 00:27:29.780
 - Yeah, all right.

00:27:29.780 --> 00:27:32.140
 But that was done in 1944 in June.

00:27:32.140 --> 00:27:35.140
 Two teenage French sisters applied a load

00:27:35.140 --> 00:27:37.340
 of carburandum powder to a train

00:27:37.340 --> 00:27:40.140
 that gummed up the tank supply to Normandy.

00:27:40.140 --> 00:27:40.980
 - Wow.

00:27:40.980 --> 00:27:42.900
 - So it's quite, that was an incredibly effective maneuver

00:27:42.900 --> 00:27:43.900
 at that time, yeah, yeah.

00:27:43.900 --> 00:27:46.740
 - It was also important in the Second World War

00:27:46.740 --> 00:27:48.260
 because of where it comes from.

00:27:48.260 --> 00:27:50.620
 So rose hips are the standard itching powder, right?

00:27:50.620 --> 00:27:52.220
 When I was a kid, it was always like, you know,

00:27:52.220 --> 00:27:54.820
 you should spread the seeds on someone from a rose hip

00:27:54.820 --> 00:27:56.380
 and it'll be very, very itchy.

00:27:56.380 --> 00:27:57.860
 That's what most itching powder is made out of.

00:27:57.860 --> 00:27:59.060
 Did you guys used to do that?

00:27:59.060 --> 00:27:59.900
 - I never did.

00:27:59.900 --> 00:28:00.740
 - No.

00:28:00.740 --> 00:28:02.500
 - Oh, Andy, you had it done to you.

00:28:02.500 --> 00:28:05.820
 (audience laughs)

00:28:05.820 --> 00:28:08.660
 And you thought you had fleas, all of your teenagers.

00:28:08.660 --> 00:28:10.740
 - Oh, the drugs on them, 'cause I also had fleas.

00:28:10.740 --> 00:28:12.220
 (audience laughs)

00:28:12.220 --> 00:28:15.100
 - But they're also an incredibly good source of vitamin C.

00:28:15.100 --> 00:28:17.300
 So I love, they're one of the few things you can eat

00:28:17.300 --> 00:28:19.100
 and we're just coming up to rose hip season.

00:28:19.100 --> 00:28:19.940
 It's in winter.

00:28:19.940 --> 00:28:21.180
 How many berries can you eat in winter?

00:28:21.180 --> 00:28:23.780
 And you squeeze the, you know, the red juice out

00:28:23.780 --> 00:28:24.700
 and it's delicious.

00:28:24.700 --> 00:28:27.420
 But it has 20 times more vitamin C than oranges.

00:28:27.420 --> 00:28:30.500
 And in World War II, oranges in short supply

00:28:30.500 --> 00:28:32.300
 because we couldn't import many things.

00:28:32.300 --> 00:28:35.460
 And so the government ran this huge rose hip collection

00:28:35.460 --> 00:28:38.020
 campaign and they organized whole days

00:28:38.020 --> 00:28:40.900
 when they sent out Boy Scouts and school children

00:28:40.900 --> 00:28:43.740
 and WI people to go and collect rose hips

00:28:43.740 --> 00:28:45.900
 and turn it into syrup.

00:28:45.900 --> 00:28:49.180
 And I think they collected 134 million hips.

00:28:49.180 --> 00:28:50.460
 - Wow, that's great.

00:28:50.460 --> 00:28:51.820
 - Not around here though, I don't think,

00:28:51.820 --> 00:28:53.700
 'cause they had ribena, right?

00:28:53.700 --> 00:28:56.420
 'Cause wasn't ribena invented in Bristol?

00:28:56.420 --> 00:28:57.260
 Yeah.

00:28:57.260 --> 00:29:00.060
 And I think they, it was invented here for World War II

00:29:00.060 --> 00:29:02.220
 because there weren't many oranges,

00:29:02.220 --> 00:29:03.620
 just as a vitamin C thing.

00:29:03.620 --> 00:29:06.220
 And I think they gave it free to kids.

00:29:06.220 --> 00:29:07.060
 - Wow, did they?

00:29:07.060 --> 00:29:07.900
 - Ribena, yeah.

00:29:07.900 --> 00:29:08.740
 - That's great.

00:29:08.740 --> 00:29:09.620
 - Wow, that's awesome.

00:29:09.620 --> 00:29:12.580
 The Duk Horvos of Canada.

00:29:12.580 --> 00:29:16.580
 So those who left Russia and they set up this,

00:29:16.580 --> 00:29:18.620
 this basically thing, that word is basically,

00:29:18.620 --> 00:29:20.940
 it kind of means spirit wrestlers.

00:29:20.940 --> 00:29:22.940
 It was the idea that people didn't believe

00:29:22.940 --> 00:29:24.180
 just in the word of the Bible.

00:29:24.180 --> 00:29:26.540
 They thought personal revelation was very important.

00:29:26.540 --> 00:29:29.260
 So they wrestled with what the Bible was telling them

00:29:29.260 --> 00:29:31.580
 and that set them up as their own thing.

00:29:31.580 --> 00:29:33.140
 They moved over to Canada.

00:29:33.140 --> 00:29:34.820
 And the people that we're talking about

00:29:34.820 --> 00:29:37.260
 who largely were dealing with the Mounties,

00:29:37.260 --> 00:29:39.260
 dealing with protests and so on,

00:29:39.260 --> 00:29:41.180
 they were kind of a splinter group of them.

00:29:41.180 --> 00:29:43.340
 They were called the Sons of Freedom.

00:29:43.340 --> 00:29:45.180
 And effectively what they liked to mix

00:29:45.180 --> 00:29:47.300
 was nudism and arson.

00:29:47.300 --> 00:29:49.860
 And this was in their own communities as well.

00:29:49.860 --> 00:29:51.740
 They thought materialism was too much

00:29:51.740 --> 00:29:53.220
 and that needed to be done by.

00:29:53.220 --> 00:29:55.140
 So I was reading this article about a guy

00:29:55.140 --> 00:29:58.020
 called J.J. Virgin who said when he was a kid,

00:29:58.020 --> 00:30:01.460
 he used to come home and there would be some naked old lady

00:30:01.460 --> 00:30:03.300
 trying to burn his house down.

00:30:03.300 --> 00:30:05.260
 And they'd have to go get out of here.

00:30:05.260 --> 00:30:06.660
 Like they were rats.

00:30:06.660 --> 00:30:08.140
 - I think he's the leader of the group now.

00:30:08.140 --> 00:30:08.980
 - Yeah, exactly.

00:30:08.980 --> 00:30:12.100
 - So his great, great, great, great, great grandfather

00:30:12.100 --> 00:30:15.580
 was Peter Virgin, who all of these people must have had,

00:30:15.580 --> 00:30:18.180
 I'm not surprised they didn't want to go to school

00:30:18.180 --> 00:30:19.340
 because they would have had a--

00:30:19.340 --> 00:30:20.180
 - Because they were virgins.

00:30:20.180 --> 00:30:21.780
 - They would have had a hard, hard time.

00:30:21.780 --> 00:30:24.100
 Just, that's a tailor-made nickname.

00:30:24.100 --> 00:30:27.340
 So Peter Virgin was, he was killed on a train

00:30:27.340 --> 00:30:28.260
 in British Columbia.

00:30:28.260 --> 00:30:29.100
 He was blown up.

00:30:29.100 --> 00:30:34.420
 And his followers then set their houses on fire in protest

00:30:34.420 --> 00:30:35.700
 and then stood around them naked.

00:30:35.700 --> 00:30:38.460
 This was part of, it was just part of the society.

00:30:38.460 --> 00:30:40.140
 - But they only burned their own stuff.

00:30:40.140 --> 00:30:41.500
 And to be fair, we should say,

00:30:41.500 --> 00:30:43.500
 'cause they're still out there, the duke of balls.

00:30:43.500 --> 00:30:45.140
 The vast majority, not nudists,

00:30:45.140 --> 00:30:47.260
 very embarrassed by this weird nudist sect,

00:30:47.260 --> 00:30:48.820
 like an embarrassing uncle,

00:30:48.820 --> 00:30:50.060
 getting naked, setting fire to stuff.

00:30:50.060 --> 00:30:51.580
 - The vast majority were just,

00:30:51.580 --> 00:30:54.860
 their motto was, "Toyle and a peaceful life."

00:30:54.860 --> 00:30:58.580
 What a depressing way to live, but you know.

00:30:58.580 --> 00:30:59.540
 - It's not depressing though.

00:30:59.540 --> 00:31:02.500
 Peter Virgin, he founded a town called Brilliant.

00:31:02.500 --> 00:31:03.740
 - Yes, I love it.

00:31:03.740 --> 00:31:04.580
 - Yeah.

00:31:04.580 --> 00:31:05.420
 - Such a good PR.

00:31:05.420 --> 00:31:06.820
 'Cause everything you build there can be called,

00:31:06.820 --> 00:31:08.660
 oh, the Brilliant Cafe.

00:31:08.660 --> 00:31:10.660
 - Absolutely, there's a Brilliant Bridge,

00:31:10.660 --> 00:31:12.020
 a Brilliant Power Station,

00:31:12.020 --> 00:31:14.820
 a Brilliant Jam Factory, and a Brilliant Cemetery.

00:31:14.820 --> 00:31:18.460
 - Actually, to be fair, I think the Brilliant Jam Factory

00:31:18.460 --> 00:31:19.820
 was one of the things that was burned down.

00:31:19.820 --> 00:31:21.380
 - It was, yeah, it's not there anymore.

00:31:21.380 --> 00:31:25.420
 - But Tolstoy was the one who facilitated their emigration.

00:31:25.420 --> 00:31:26.860
 They're persecuted in Russia,

00:31:26.860 --> 00:31:29.780
 because they refuse to do anything the czar says.

00:31:29.780 --> 00:31:31.620
 And Tolstoy's like, "Hey, I love people

00:31:31.620 --> 00:31:33.820
 "who deny themselves all the fun stuff in life."

00:31:33.820 --> 00:31:34.660
 You know.

00:31:34.660 --> 00:31:36.100
 - Like people who read my novels.

00:31:36.100 --> 00:31:36.940
 (laughing)

00:31:36.940 --> 00:31:37.780
 - Exactly.

00:31:37.780 --> 00:31:40.700
 And so he raised the money,

00:31:40.700 --> 00:31:43.100
 actually out of the proceeds of resurrection,

00:31:43.100 --> 00:31:46.180
 his third, less well-read novel.

00:31:46.180 --> 00:31:48.060
 He paid for them to get to Canada.

00:31:48.060 --> 00:31:49.340
 - Yeah, yeah, cool.

00:31:49.340 --> 00:31:51.020
 - And they put up a statue to them in return.

00:31:51.020 --> 00:31:51.860
 - Yes.

00:31:51.860 --> 00:31:56.180
 - Nude protest has been a thing for centuries,

00:31:56.180 --> 00:31:58.180
 as the Dukubos kind of show.

00:31:58.180 --> 00:31:59.300
 But there are recent examples too.

00:31:59.300 --> 00:32:03.900
 So in 2020, French dentists launched a nude protest

00:32:03.900 --> 00:32:07.260
 to protest the lack of PPE in their sector.

00:32:07.260 --> 00:32:08.300
 - No. - They did.

00:32:08.300 --> 00:32:13.220
 They took a series of reasonably erotic shots of themselves.

00:32:13.220 --> 00:32:14.540
 - Open wide.

00:32:14.540 --> 00:32:16.780
 (laughing)

00:32:17.620 --> 00:32:21.420
 - You could have said spit.

00:32:21.420 --> 00:32:22.740
 Yeah, okay, anyway.

00:32:22.740 --> 00:32:23.580
 (laughing)

00:32:23.580 --> 00:32:25.820
 No, they took photos of themselves nude in their surgeries

00:32:25.820 --> 00:32:27.260
 to say, "Look, we're being hung out to dry here.

00:32:27.260 --> 00:32:28.380
 "We don't have any PPE."

00:32:28.380 --> 00:32:29.220
 So I think that's great. - Right, wow.

00:32:29.220 --> 00:32:30.700
 - German doctors did the same thing.

00:32:30.700 --> 00:32:31.540
 - Wow.

00:32:31.540 --> 00:32:34.100
 - In 2022, a Somerset woman called Jill White

00:32:34.100 --> 00:32:38.260
 did a fantastic nude protest on the A358 in Somerset.

00:32:38.260 --> 00:32:39.180
 Right, she's in a wheelchair.

00:32:39.180 --> 00:32:41.660
 And the council had let the pavement

00:32:41.660 --> 00:32:43.580
 by the side of this road get completely overgrown.

00:32:43.580 --> 00:32:45.340
 She could not get along it in her wheelchair.

00:32:45.340 --> 00:32:47.460
 I mean, to see the photos is ridiculous.

00:32:47.460 --> 00:32:49.220
 No one could be a pedestrian on this road,

00:32:49.220 --> 00:32:50.900
 and especially not if you're in a chair.

00:32:50.900 --> 00:32:53.380
 So she posed naked along the roadside

00:32:53.380 --> 00:32:55.780
 with protest signs aimed at the council

00:32:55.780 --> 00:32:57.260
 saying, "I've trimmed my bush.

00:32:57.260 --> 00:32:58.740
 "Now highways trim yours."

00:32:58.740 --> 00:32:59.980
 - Oh, wow.

00:32:59.980 --> 00:33:01.300
 Yeah.

00:33:01.300 --> 00:33:02.860
 - Super.

00:33:02.860 --> 00:33:03.860
 - Awesome.

00:33:03.860 --> 00:33:05.460
 - She'd been complaining for two years,

00:33:05.460 --> 00:33:06.300
 getting no results.

00:33:06.300 --> 00:33:07.940
 As soon as she started taking off her clothes,

00:33:07.940 --> 00:33:09.860
 they acted and they trimmed it and they dealt with it.

00:33:09.860 --> 00:33:10.700
 - Wow.

00:33:10.700 --> 00:33:12.180
 - Really good.

00:33:12.180 --> 00:33:14.060
 - In Christianity, it is often a thing, isn't it?

00:33:14.060 --> 00:33:15.460
 Trying to be like Adam and Eve.

00:33:15.460 --> 00:33:16.300
 - Yeah.

00:33:16.300 --> 00:33:19.060
 - And the nudist, I quite like, are the ranters.

00:33:19.060 --> 00:33:21.300
 I didn't, have you heard of the ranters?

00:33:21.300 --> 00:33:23.140
 - Are they like Ramblers or?

00:33:23.140 --> 00:33:25.420
 - Was it someone called Clarkson?

00:33:25.420 --> 00:33:27.740
 Was it a cadre of the ranters?

00:33:27.740 --> 00:33:28.900
 I think he actually was.

00:33:28.900 --> 00:33:29.740
 - I think it was.

00:33:29.740 --> 00:33:30.580
 - Oh, genuinely.

00:33:30.580 --> 00:33:31.420
 - All right.

00:33:31.420 --> 00:33:33.020
 - There was basically, this was during the English Civil War

00:33:33.020 --> 00:33:35.780
 when lots of Quakers and Shakers and Weird Sex popped up

00:33:35.780 --> 00:33:37.180
 and the ranters are one of them.

00:33:37.180 --> 00:33:38.020
 And they were the best

00:33:38.020 --> 00:33:40.500
 'cause they basically didn't really have any leader,

00:33:40.500 --> 00:33:41.740
 didn't really have any beliefs

00:33:41.740 --> 00:33:44.740
 except to eat good meat, drink loads of alcohol,

00:33:44.740 --> 00:33:49.100
 swear loads in pubs, embrace sex, and cause havoc.

00:33:49.100 --> 00:33:50.100
 And be naked.

00:33:50.100 --> 00:33:51.780
 - So it does sound like Clarkson would have been.

00:33:51.780 --> 00:33:52.620
 - It does sound like Clarkson would have been.

00:33:52.620 --> 00:33:53.940
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:33:53.940 --> 00:33:58.460
 - This is the greatest religious grouping in the world.

00:33:58.460 --> 00:33:59.300
 - Yeah.

00:33:59.300 --> 00:34:00.140
 - Yeah.

00:34:00.140 --> 00:34:02.540
 - And then he gets naked and everyone leaves it.

00:34:02.540 --> 00:34:05.120
 (upbeat music)

00:34:05.120 --> 00:34:11.340
 - It is time for fact number four

00:34:11.340 --> 00:34:13.220
 and that is my fact.

00:34:13.220 --> 00:34:17.740
 My fact is that the world of statistical analysis

00:34:17.740 --> 00:34:19.300
 was changed forever

00:34:19.300 --> 00:34:23.260
 because of a woman called Dr. Myriel Bristol

00:34:23.260 --> 00:34:25.660
 who is most famous for being able to tell

00:34:25.660 --> 00:34:30.660
 whether a cup of tea was poured milk first or tea first.

00:34:30.660 --> 00:34:34.020
 - The controversial topic in the room apparently.

00:34:34.020 --> 00:34:35.140
 - Yeah.

00:34:35.140 --> 00:34:37.460
 - Do you all think you could tell?

00:34:37.460 --> 00:34:39.140
 - I think I could tell personally.

00:34:39.140 --> 00:34:39.960
 - Do you?

00:34:39.960 --> 00:34:41.840
 - I'm confident I could tell.

00:34:41.840 --> 00:34:42.920
 - Wow, okay.

00:34:42.920 --> 00:34:43.760
 - I'm certain.

00:34:43.760 --> 00:34:45.820
 - I am as well actually and which do you prefer?

00:34:45.820 --> 00:34:48.660
 - Oh, well, I mean, tea and first.

00:34:48.660 --> 00:34:49.580
 - Yeah.

00:34:49.580 --> 00:34:50.500
 - Because--

00:34:50.500 --> 00:34:52.260
 - Let's hear it for milk and first.

00:34:52.260 --> 00:34:55.740
 - Okay, can I just call nonsense

00:34:55.740 --> 00:34:57.580
 on that milk and first crowd, right?

00:34:57.580 --> 00:34:58.420
 - Right.

00:34:58.420 --> 00:35:02.340
 - 96% of tea is made by people putting a bag in a mug,

00:35:02.340 --> 00:35:05.020
 single serving of tea, pouring hot water on the bag.

00:35:05.020 --> 00:35:09.580
 There's nobody alive in the world who puts a milk in a mug

00:35:09.580 --> 00:35:10.840
 and puts the bag in the milk.

00:35:10.840 --> 00:35:13.720
 - I think though, 'cause this was in the 1920s,

00:35:13.720 --> 00:35:15.720
 I think more people were doing it in those days.

00:35:15.720 --> 00:35:16.560
 - It was the time of--

00:35:16.560 --> 00:35:17.400
 - Tea pots.

00:35:17.400 --> 00:35:18.220
 - It was big teapots.

00:35:18.220 --> 00:35:19.280
 It was the golden age of the teapot.

00:35:19.280 --> 00:35:21.680
 - But how did statistics change then?

00:35:21.680 --> 00:35:23.720
 - Oh, okay, well, this is amazing.

00:35:23.720 --> 00:35:28.720
 So Muriel Bristol was a phycologist, not a psychologist.

00:35:28.720 --> 00:35:32.240
 There's a very distinct difference.

00:35:32.240 --> 00:35:36.040
 You don't wanna be telling your woes to a moss expert,

00:35:36.040 --> 00:35:37.120
 an algae expert.

00:35:37.120 --> 00:35:38.200
 - Don't you?

00:35:38.200 --> 00:35:40.300
 (laughing)

00:35:40.300 --> 00:35:42.860
 - So one day she was in a common room

00:35:42.860 --> 00:35:46.060
 where a lot of scientists were at Romestead

00:35:46.060 --> 00:35:48.140
 and there was a guy there called Ronald Fisher.

00:35:48.140 --> 00:35:51.900
 He offers her a cup of tea and he's making her the tea

00:35:51.900 --> 00:35:55.020
 and she declines it because she prefers it

00:35:55.020 --> 00:35:57.140
 when the milk was poured into the cup before the tea.

00:35:57.140 --> 00:36:01.340
 So she's one of the people who are in the minority here

00:36:01.340 --> 00:36:03.260
 and he was like, "Well, don't be ridiculous.

00:36:03.260 --> 00:36:04.140
 "You can't taste that."

00:36:04.140 --> 00:36:06.460
 And she said, "Well, absolutely I can taste that."

00:36:06.460 --> 00:36:09.700
 And so the story goes is that eight cups of tea were made,

00:36:09.700 --> 00:36:11.480
 four with milk poured in first

00:36:11.480 --> 00:36:14.120
 and then four with the milk in afterwards.

00:36:14.120 --> 00:36:17.200
 And he developed a hypothesis basically

00:36:17.200 --> 00:36:20.560
 on how this is applicable to statistics generally

00:36:20.560 --> 00:36:23.920
 and it has become quite a bedrock of statistics as a result.

00:36:23.920 --> 00:36:27.320
 - Yeah, so we should say Fisher was not that...

00:36:27.320 --> 00:36:29.180
 I don't think he gave a shit about milk in first

00:36:29.180 --> 00:36:30.800
 and tea in first, to be very honest.

00:36:30.800 --> 00:36:31.640
 - No, no, of course.

00:36:31.640 --> 00:36:34.320
 - He didn't mind whether she knew,

00:36:34.320 --> 00:36:38.500
 but it was about developing the kind of moment

00:36:38.500 --> 00:36:40.860
 at which you agree that if someone's claimed

00:36:40.860 --> 00:36:43.900
 they can do something, that has been kind of proven.

00:36:43.900 --> 00:36:47.980
 So he decided that after she said correctly eight times,

00:36:47.980 --> 00:36:50.460
 whether the milk was in first or the tea was in first,

00:36:50.460 --> 00:36:54.300
 there's a one in 70 chance that she'd get that correct.

00:36:54.300 --> 00:36:56.180
 That's probably about right.

00:36:56.180 --> 00:36:57.020
 - It's sort of the...

00:36:57.020 --> 00:36:59.380
 This was the birth of the randomized controlled trial.

00:36:59.380 --> 00:37:00.220
 - Yeah.

00:37:00.220 --> 00:37:02.620
 - Which is the gold standard of all scientific trials today.

00:37:02.620 --> 00:37:04.500
 The tea cups are presented, yeah.

00:37:04.500 --> 00:37:07.840
 The tea cups were presented in a random order.

00:37:07.840 --> 00:37:09.680
 She would, I think the odds of her knowing,

00:37:09.680 --> 00:37:10.520
 did you say it?

00:37:10.520 --> 00:37:11.640
 It was one in 70. - Yeah, one in 70.

00:37:11.640 --> 00:37:13.320
 - Yeah, just there was no way.

00:37:13.320 --> 00:37:16.680
 Well, there was a 1.4% chance of her getting it exactly right.

00:37:16.680 --> 00:37:18.800
 - And these statistical tests are still used

00:37:18.800 --> 00:37:22.320
 if you've got something where you're only doing a few tests,

00:37:22.320 --> 00:37:24.120
 you can't do it a billion times

00:37:24.120 --> 00:37:26.040
 and see whether she gets it right a billion times.

00:37:26.040 --> 00:37:27.680
 You only do it eight or nine times

00:37:27.680 --> 00:37:28.960
 and you see what the chances are.

00:37:28.960 --> 00:37:31.200
 - Yeah, so there's a popular science writer

00:37:31.200 --> 00:37:33.740
 called Karl Zimmer and he wrote in his article

00:37:33.740 --> 00:37:36.500
 "Why We Can't Rule Out Bigfoot".

00:37:36.500 --> 00:37:37.560
 He said...

00:37:37.560 --> 00:37:38.500
 - Incredible.

00:37:38.500 --> 00:37:40.900
 - He said that this method has become an important tool

00:37:40.900 --> 00:37:42.180
 for scientific discovery.

00:37:42.180 --> 00:37:44.300
 You find the test in every branch of science

00:37:44.300 --> 00:37:47.020
 from psychology to virology to cosmology

00:37:47.020 --> 00:37:50.080
 and scientists have followed it using his threshold method.

00:37:50.080 --> 00:37:51.480
 So it's hugely important.

00:37:51.480 --> 00:37:53.700
 - Although his threshold was incorrect

00:37:53.700 --> 00:37:55.860
 to what statisticians do today, I think,

00:37:55.860 --> 00:37:57.580
 which is long actually, he didn't need

00:37:57.580 --> 00:37:58.980
 to make eight cups of tea.

00:37:58.980 --> 00:38:00.940
 I think he could have only made six

00:38:00.940 --> 00:38:03.360
 'cause I think mostly if you show that something

00:38:03.360 --> 00:38:06.300
 only has a 5% chance of happening in statistics,

00:38:06.300 --> 00:38:08.560
 then you've decided that's fine, that's legit,

00:38:08.560 --> 00:38:10.900
 that this, therefore, is a real thing.

00:38:10.900 --> 00:38:14.460
 So two useless cups of tea that wasted, I think.

00:38:14.460 --> 00:38:15.920
 But I think what's quite nice about this

00:38:15.920 --> 00:38:18.160
 is that if you've studied statistics ever,

00:38:18.160 --> 00:38:20.380
 Lady Tasting Tea is like the bedrock.

00:38:20.380 --> 00:38:22.000
 It's the most famous thing.

00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:25.040
 But who knows that it's this random algae expert

00:38:25.040 --> 00:38:28.080
 and most sweetly, the reason it happened was, I think,

00:38:28.080 --> 00:38:29.440
 'cause of a bit of flirting

00:38:29.440 --> 00:38:32.120
 because basically she was with this, you know,

00:38:32.120 --> 00:38:34.080
 very big deal mathematician, Ronald Fisher,

00:38:34.080 --> 00:38:35.720
 and she claimed this about the milk and tea.

00:38:35.720 --> 00:38:38.960
 But the person who said, I bet you don't know

00:38:38.960 --> 00:38:41.140
 where the milk's gone in first or tea's gone in first,

00:38:41.140 --> 00:38:44.700
 was another guy in the room, a biochemist called William Roach.

00:38:44.700 --> 00:38:46.840
 And he was like, go on, let's test her.

00:38:46.840 --> 00:38:48.380
 Let's see if she does know.

00:38:48.380 --> 00:38:50.300
 And William Roach went on to marry her.

00:38:50.300 --> 00:38:52.800
 And if that's not some kind of like saddle

00:38:52.800 --> 00:38:56.720
 across the lab flirting, go on, let's test her.

00:38:56.720 --> 00:38:57.560
 - It's very sweet.

00:38:57.560 --> 00:39:00.680
 - Do you wanna hear a bit more of lab flirting from history?

00:39:00.680 --> 00:39:01.520
 - Yeah.

00:39:01.520 --> 00:39:05.320
 - So is anyone here familiar with the Bristol stool chart?

00:39:05.320 --> 00:39:06.160
 - Oh, yeah.

00:39:06.160 --> 00:39:10.880
 - Yeah, it's a big deal over here.

00:39:10.880 --> 00:39:13.560
 You're all checking your poos every day

00:39:13.560 --> 00:39:17.600
 and checking whether they're sausage-shaped but lumpy

00:39:17.600 --> 00:39:20.640
 or soft blobs with a clear-cut edge.

00:39:20.640 --> 00:39:22.520
 - James, I think you promised flirting

00:39:22.520 --> 00:39:25.440
 and I'm not currently seeing any.

00:39:25.440 --> 00:39:28.520
 - This was invented by a guy called Dr. Ken Heaton.

00:39:28.520 --> 00:39:31.680
 And when he was at university,

00:39:31.680 --> 00:39:34.600
 he was asked by one of his lecturers

00:39:34.600 --> 00:39:37.560
 to examine the ankle of a fellow student

00:39:37.560 --> 00:39:39.760
 who was called Susan O'Connor.

00:39:39.760 --> 00:39:42.240
 And the ankle examination went so well

00:39:42.240 --> 00:39:43.960
 that they got married.

00:39:43.960 --> 00:39:46.640
 - Wow, that is very good.

00:39:46.640 --> 00:39:47.640
 - Did he fall in love with the ankles?

00:39:47.640 --> 00:39:48.480
 Do we know?

00:39:48.480 --> 00:39:49.800
 - Yeah, and worked his way up.

00:39:49.800 --> 00:39:50.640
 - Yeah. - Maybe.

00:39:52.640 --> 00:39:55.720
 - She was very cool, Muriel Bristol.

00:39:55.720 --> 00:39:57.320
 She worked at this place, Dan described,

00:39:57.320 --> 00:39:58.720
 Rothamsted Experimental Station.

00:39:58.720 --> 00:39:59.560
 - Yeah.

00:39:59.560 --> 00:40:00.600
 - And one of the things they had,

00:40:00.600 --> 00:40:04.320
 they had soil that was collected in 1846, right?

00:40:04.320 --> 00:40:06.440
 And at the time, she was studying the same soil,

00:40:06.440 --> 00:40:08.840
 the same sample in 1919.

00:40:08.840 --> 00:40:12.360
 And she found that if you feed it little solution

00:40:12.360 --> 00:40:15.880
 of minerals, then life appears.

00:40:15.880 --> 00:40:17.320
 I tried to find out interesting people

00:40:17.320 --> 00:40:22.320
 who would span the dates 1846 to 1919

00:40:22.320 --> 00:40:24.480
 very few really interesting people.

00:40:24.480 --> 00:40:25.320
 - Okay.

00:40:25.320 --> 00:40:26.160
 - Who have you got?

00:40:26.160 --> 00:40:28.120
 - Well, 1919 JD Salinger was born,

00:40:28.120 --> 00:40:29.200
 catcher in the rye.

00:40:29.200 --> 00:40:30.200
 He's pretty cool.

00:40:30.200 --> 00:40:31.400
 You know, I like him.

00:40:31.400 --> 00:40:33.400
 - He was drinking his own urine by the end,

00:40:33.400 --> 00:40:35.040
 which was really interesting.

00:40:35.040 --> 00:40:37.880
 - Wow, that's incredibly depressing.

00:40:37.880 --> 00:40:40.680
 Do you wanna hear the 1846?

00:40:40.680 --> 00:40:41.520
 - Sure.

00:40:41.520 --> 00:40:43.400
 - I'd really tried to find people who died in 1846

00:40:43.400 --> 00:40:45.680
 who were of interest to us.

00:40:45.680 --> 00:40:48.560
 Have you heard of John Ainsworth Horrocks?

00:40:48.560 --> 00:40:51.520
 - Yeah, he was killed by his own camel or something, right?

00:40:51.520 --> 00:40:52.360
 - Bingo.

00:40:52.360 --> 00:40:53.180
 Well, I remembered.

00:40:53.180 --> 00:40:54.020
 Yeah.

00:40:54.020 --> 00:40:54.840
 - What's he?

00:40:54.840 --> 00:40:55.680
 - He was one of the early Europeans

00:40:55.680 --> 00:40:57.720
 to go very deep into Australia

00:40:57.720 --> 00:40:59.720
 and he was shot by his own camel.

00:40:59.720 --> 00:41:00.560
 - Really?

00:41:00.560 --> 00:41:01.400
 - Yeah.

00:41:01.400 --> 00:41:02.240
 - Okay.

00:41:02.240 --> 00:41:03.200
 - And how is he associated with this?

00:41:03.200 --> 00:41:06.040
 - He died in 1846,

00:41:06.040 --> 00:41:08.640
 which is the year that the soil sample was collected.

00:41:08.640 --> 00:41:09.480
 - Oh.

00:41:09.480 --> 00:41:10.320
 - Oh.

00:41:10.320 --> 00:41:12.720
 - That Muriel Bristol then studied in 1919.

00:41:12.720 --> 00:41:14.520
 - And did she collect it from Australia?

00:41:14.520 --> 00:41:15.360
 - No.

00:41:15.360 --> 00:41:16.200
 No, no one.

00:41:16.200 --> 00:41:17.040
 No.

00:41:17.040 --> 00:41:19.600
 - It's serious, isn't it?

00:41:19.600 --> 00:41:20.440
 - Thanks.

00:41:20.440 --> 00:41:21.280
 - I was looking at other,

00:41:21.280 --> 00:41:24.920
 cool statistical stuff that's named after randomers

00:41:24.920 --> 00:41:26.800
 who don't know anything about the statistics,

00:41:26.800 --> 00:41:27.640
 which she didn't.

00:41:27.640 --> 00:41:28.460
 She knew about algae.

00:41:28.460 --> 00:41:30.960
 And do you guys know about the Will Rogers paradox?

00:41:30.960 --> 00:41:33.240
 - The comedian in America.

00:41:33.240 --> 00:41:34.960
 - Of course you know who Will Rogers is.

00:41:34.960 --> 00:41:37.120
 The vaudeville 1930s comedian.

00:41:37.120 --> 00:41:39.720
 Does anyone else know who Will Rogers is?

00:41:39.720 --> 00:41:40.560
 Brilliant, Anne.

00:41:40.560 --> 00:41:43.560
 You are so, so good and so niche.

00:41:43.560 --> 00:41:45.040
 - Can you imagine the only person in the room

00:41:45.040 --> 00:41:47.080
 who knew him is sat right next to you.

00:41:47.080 --> 00:41:48.760
 (laughing)

00:41:48.760 --> 00:41:50.200
 - So he had a joke

00:41:50.200 --> 00:41:52.800
 which had them rolling in the arse in the 30s

00:41:52.800 --> 00:41:55.840
 at a time when during the Great Depression

00:41:55.840 --> 00:41:58.240
 and a lot of people from Oklahoma had left

00:41:58.240 --> 00:41:59.080
 and moved to California

00:41:59.080 --> 00:41:59.920
 'cause they were very poor.

00:41:59.920 --> 00:42:01.240
 They wanted to make a life elsewhere.

00:42:01.240 --> 00:42:02.520
 And they were called Okeys.

00:42:02.520 --> 00:42:04.280
 And he had a joke which went,

00:42:04.280 --> 00:42:07.480
 "Hey, when the Okeys left Oklahoma and moved to California,

00:42:07.480 --> 00:42:11.920
 "they raised the average intelligence level in both states."

00:42:11.920 --> 00:42:13.000
 Yeah.

00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:14.920
 Still, it still gets a few of them going.

00:42:14.920 --> 00:42:15.760
 - Yeah.

00:42:15.760 --> 00:42:16.680
 - So that's basically saying,

00:42:16.680 --> 00:42:18.000
 "Hey, these guys are so thick

00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:19.360
 "that once they leave Oklahoma,

00:42:19.360 --> 00:42:20.440
 "Oklahoma gets smarter."

00:42:20.440 --> 00:42:22.200
 But Californians are so thick

00:42:22.200 --> 00:42:23.960
 that once they enter California,

00:42:23.960 --> 00:42:25.280
 they'll make California smarter.

00:42:25.280 --> 00:42:27.080
 The weird thing about this is, right,

00:42:27.080 --> 00:42:29.280
 you've made, that is statistically possible,

00:42:29.280 --> 00:42:30.160
 if that were true.

00:42:30.160 --> 00:42:33.120
 You've made the average intelligence of both places higher.

00:42:33.120 --> 00:42:35.440
 But of course, you've only involved the same people.

00:42:35.440 --> 00:42:38.840
 So you haven't made the overall average intelligence higher.

00:42:38.840 --> 00:42:41.280
 How is this possible?

00:42:41.280 --> 00:42:43.560
 And it is possible 'cause it's all about weighted averages

00:42:43.560 --> 00:42:45.240
 and we don't need to go into that.

00:42:45.240 --> 00:42:47.080
 (laughing)

00:42:47.080 --> 00:42:48.920
 I think that's a really cool paradox.

00:42:48.920 --> 00:42:52.080
 I'm made up by a comedian who made a silly joke in the 30s

00:42:52.080 --> 00:42:54.280
 who didn't know that his name would be placed

00:42:54.280 --> 00:42:55.600
 in mathematical history.

00:42:55.600 --> 00:42:56.440
 - Yeah, very cool.

00:42:56.440 --> 00:42:57.440
 - A good match. - Very cool.

00:42:57.440 --> 00:42:59.360
 - I heard two of you saying...

00:42:59.360 --> 00:43:01.840
 - Oh, I know if milk's been poured into the tea

00:43:01.840 --> 00:43:02.920
 beforehand or not.

00:43:02.920 --> 00:43:03.840
 (audience laughing)

00:43:03.840 --> 00:43:05.360
 - Well, we've got four cups of tea here.

00:43:05.360 --> 00:43:06.200
 - Oh, piss off.

00:43:06.200 --> 00:43:08.160
 (audience laughing)

00:43:08.160 --> 00:43:11.680
 - It's James Lee, everyone, our tour manager.

00:43:11.680 --> 00:43:13.040
 (audience applauding)

00:43:13.040 --> 00:43:14.200
 - Here we go.

00:43:14.200 --> 00:43:17.440
 Two have had milk poured in to begin with

00:43:17.440 --> 00:43:19.080
 and two have had them in afterwards.

00:43:19.080 --> 00:43:22.160
 Now, have a taste test and let's see if you can...

00:43:22.160 --> 00:43:23.160
 - This is for me and Anna.

00:43:23.160 --> 00:43:24.480
 - Yeah. - Okay.

00:43:24.480 --> 00:43:25.400
 - That one's tea first.

00:43:25.400 --> 00:43:26.440
 - Okay.

00:43:26.440 --> 00:43:27.520
 - Milk first.

00:43:27.520 --> 00:43:29.680
 - Oh, God, it's so sweet.

00:43:29.680 --> 00:43:31.640
 - This is captivating, God, yeah.

00:43:31.640 --> 00:43:34.400
 (audience laughing)

00:43:34.400 --> 00:43:36.000
 - These are both tea first.

00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:37.480
 - You have two tea first.

00:43:37.480 --> 00:43:38.320
 - Yeah, I definitely.

00:43:38.320 --> 00:43:40.880
 - Okay, Andy, what are you gonna say then?

00:43:40.880 --> 00:43:42.640
 - I think one of mine is milk first.

00:43:42.640 --> 00:43:43.760
 - Okay. - It's a lot milkier.

00:43:43.760 --> 00:43:45.000
 I'll tell you that much.

00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:45.840
 - Yeah.

00:43:45.840 --> 00:43:47.320
 - So one of you has to be wrong, right?

00:43:47.320 --> 00:43:48.720
 Because there's two and two of each,

00:43:48.720 --> 00:43:49.920
 but you've picked two for yourself.

00:43:49.920 --> 00:43:52.400
 So, James, which one?

00:43:52.400 --> 00:43:55.440
 - Look at the wrong saucer! - Look at the wrong saucer!

00:43:55.440 --> 00:43:58.160
 - This is so exciting for us.

00:43:58.160 --> 00:44:00.360
 Milk, M for milk first.

00:44:00.360 --> 00:44:02.760
 Bullshit, you've put it on the wrong...

00:44:02.760 --> 00:44:04.480
 Put it on the wrong saucer, mate.

00:44:04.480 --> 00:44:05.320
 Another M.

00:44:05.320 --> 00:44:07.080
 - You've had two.

00:44:07.080 --> 00:44:10.880
 - Both of us, neither of us got it right.

00:44:10.880 --> 00:44:13.960
 I got one right and one wrong.

00:44:13.960 --> 00:44:15.160
 - You're no Mario Bristol.

00:44:15.160 --> 00:44:16.000
 - Oh, man.

00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:18.440
 - Well, look.

00:44:18.440 --> 00:44:21.600
 That's it for our show tonight.

00:44:21.600 --> 00:44:24.000
 Thank you so much for everyone for being here.

00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:25.840
 Bristol, that was awesome.

00:44:25.840 --> 00:44:27.760
 We'll see you again soon.

00:44:27.760 --> 00:44:29.040
 We'll be back again next week

00:44:29.040 --> 00:44:30.200
 for another episode.

00:44:30.200 --> 00:44:31.040
 Goodbye!

00:44:31.040 --> 00:44:35.040
 (audience cheering)

00:44:35.040 --> 00:44:40.660
 (upbeat music)

00:44:40.660 --> 00:44:43.240
 (upbeat music)

00:44:44.240 --> 00:44:46.820
 (upbeat music)

00:44:46.820 --> 00:44:49.860
