00:00:01,00:00:03,"- Hi everyone, welcome to this week's episode"
00:00:03,00:00:04,of No Such Things as a Fish.
00:00:04,00:00:08,We are slap bang in the middle of our tour right now
00:00:08,00:00:12,and that means that you yourself can come and see us live.
00:00:12,00:00:14,"- Yes, you can."
00:00:14,00:00:15,We love doing the tours.
00:00:15,00:00:17,We're having a great time this time around.
00:00:17,00:00:20,We record a new podcast every time we do a show
00:00:20,00:00:22,"and we have lots of little nerdy,"
00:00:22,00:00:25,extra never before seen bits in between
00:00:25,00:00:29,"and we are going to be in Cardiff, in London Town"
00:00:29,00:00:31,and in Manchester very soon.
00:00:31,00:00:33,"So we are in Cardiff on the 16th of October,"
00:00:33,00:00:35,London on the 23rd and the 24th
00:00:35,00:00:37,and Manchester on the 27th.
00:00:37,00:00:39,- That is correct.
00:00:39,00:00:42,And one of the places we will be very soon is Gothenburg.
00:00:42,00:00:46,We will be in Gothenburg on the 27th of September.
00:00:46,00:00:47,That's a week on Friday
00:00:47,00:00:50,and we will be doing a live episode of the podcast there.
00:00:50,00:00:53,"So do come along, search for the Gothenburg Book Festival"
00:00:53,00:00:55,and you'll see all the details about that.
00:00:55,00:00:57,- And of course you can get tickets to that
00:00:57,00:00:59,and all the others by going to No Such Things
00:00:59,00:01:01,as a Fish dot com slash live.
00:01:01,00:01:03,"- Okay, I don't know, I think it's time to sound check."
00:01:03,00:01:05,We better get on with it.
00:01:05,00:01:06,- Let's get on with the show.
00:01:06,00:01:07,- On with the podcast.
00:01:07,00:01:12,(beeping)
00:01:12,00:01:16,(speaking in foreign language)
00:01:16,00:01:26,- Hello and welcome to another episode
00:01:26,00:01:28,"of No Such Thing as a Fish,"
00:01:28,00:01:32,a weekly podcast this week coming to you live from Bristol.
00:01:32,00:01:35,(crowd cheering)
00:01:35,00:01:38,My name is Dan Schreiber.
00:01:38,00:01:40,"I am sitting here with Anna Tyshinski,"
00:01:40,00:01:42,Andrew Hunter Murray and James Harkin.
00:01:42,00:01:45,"And once again, we have gathered around the microphones"
00:01:45,00:01:47,with our four favorite facts from the last seven days.
00:01:47,00:01:50,"And in no particular order, here we go."
00:01:50,00:01:54,"Starting with fact number one, and that is Andy."
00:01:54,00:01:57,- My fact is that the unauthorized release of beavers
00:01:57,00:02:00,into British waterways is known as beaver bombing.
00:02:00,00:02:02,(crowd laughing)
00:02:02,00:02:03,- That's exerting.
00:02:03,00:02:04,"- Yeah, this has been covered recently."
00:02:04,00:02:06,They're all over the place now
00:02:06,00:02:07,and they've been making their way back.
00:02:07,00:02:11,So the river Otter is now full of beavers and--
00:02:11,00:02:11,- Confusingly.
00:02:11,00:02:12,- Very confusing.
00:02:12,00:02:14,"- Which pisses off the otters in the river Otter,"
00:02:14,00:02:15,as I suspect.
00:02:15,00:02:16,- Are there otters in the river Otter?
00:02:16,00:02:17,- There are otters in the river Otter.
00:02:17,00:02:20,And I did read that someone was saying the Camel River
00:02:20,00:02:21,"is another good place to introduce them,"
00:02:21,00:02:22,which I imagine will piss off the camels
00:02:22,00:02:24,in the Camel River.
00:02:24,00:02:26,- And there are hundreds of them out there now.
00:02:26,00:02:27,- Is that really in the UK?
00:02:27,00:02:28,"- In the UK, yeah, yeah."
00:02:28,00:02:30,"In researching this fact, I spoke to someone who said,"
00:02:30,00:02:32,"very secretively, they were related to someone"
00:02:32,00:02:35,who knew a thing or two about reintroducing secret beavers.
00:02:35,00:02:36,"- Oh, really?"
00:02:36,00:02:38,"- Yeah, sort of gorilla, confusingly."
00:02:38,00:02:39,(crowd laughing)
00:02:39,00:02:41,- The gorillas are furious.
00:02:41,00:02:44,"- Yeah, and so I've read an interview as well"
00:02:44,00:02:46,with a guy called Simon.
00:02:46,00:02:48,"Basically, it takes a lot of time and paperwork"
00:02:48,00:02:50,to release a beaver outside an enclosure.
00:02:50,00:02:52,You need to do an impact assessment.
00:02:52,00:02:53,"Sometimes on the Isle of Wight,"
00:02:53,00:02:57,"you have to do 100,000 words of impact assessment."
00:02:57,00:02:59,"100,000 words, that's a novel, that's a full novel."
00:02:59,00:03:02,"- Yeah, and people are objecting, aren't they?"
00:03:02,00:03:04,'Cause no one's got time to read that many words.
00:03:04,00:03:05,- But why do we want beavers anyway?
00:03:05,00:03:07,"- Well, because they build dams, don't they?"
00:03:07,00:03:09,And it creates this lovely kind of ecosystem
00:03:09,00:03:11,for lots of other things to exist.
00:03:11,00:03:12,They're like engineers.
00:03:12,00:03:15,"So there are these people, and it's such an exciting world."
00:03:15,00:03:16,"If you want to get into crime,"
00:03:16,00:03:18,"but feel like you're doing kind of a good thing,"
00:03:18,00:03:20,I think beaver bombing is the way.
00:03:20,00:03:20,- Interesting.
00:03:20,00:03:23,- There's a guy called Olivier Rubbers.
00:03:23,00:03:24,Did you read about him?
00:03:24,00:03:25,He was one of the originals.
00:03:25,00:03:28,"He was in 1998, he just heard someone mention"
00:03:28,00:03:30,"the reintroduction of beavers and he decided,"
00:03:30,00:03:33,"I'm gonna do that, borrowed his dad's car,"
00:03:33,00:03:34,and he drove to Germany.
00:03:34,00:03:37,"I think he lived in Belgium, drove to Germany,"
00:03:37,00:03:39,"picked up some beavers, crossed the border,"
00:03:39,00:03:41,"back into Belgium, dropped them in a river,"
00:03:41,00:03:44,"went so well, he repeated it with 97 more beavers."
00:03:44,00:03:45,(laughing)
00:03:45,00:03:46,- Why?
00:03:46,00:03:47,"- He did 97 different journeys,"
00:03:47,00:03:49,"or did he go, all right, lads, in the car?"
00:03:49,00:03:51,"- Yeah, it's like that riddle."
00:03:51,00:03:53,"You're not allowed to take a beaver with another beaver,"
00:03:53,00:03:54,otherwise they eat each other.
00:03:54,00:03:55,"- Right, that's crazy."
00:03:55,00:03:58,"Hey, do you know, if you let a beaver into your lounge room,"
00:03:58,00:04:00,it will rearrange all your furniture.
00:04:00,00:04:01,Isn't that amazing?
00:04:01,00:04:02,"- Oh, that's nice."
00:04:02,00:04:03,"- That's lovely, along Feng Shui principles."
00:04:03,00:04:06,"- No, this is a thing that was noticed by someone"
00:04:06,00:04:08,who wrote a lot about beavers back in the day.
00:04:08,00:04:11,She was sort of a conservationist who wanted to raise
00:04:11,00:04:14,the idea that they're intelligent animals
00:04:14,00:04:15,that they're interesting to look at.
00:04:15,00:04:17,"She was called Dorothy Richards,"
00:04:17,00:04:18,"and she was looking after beavers,"
00:04:18,00:04:19,"and they came into her house,"
00:04:19,00:04:21,"and as soon as they walked in, they were like,"
00:04:21,00:04:22,"no, let's put the chair over there,"
00:04:22,00:04:23,let's get that over there.
00:04:23,00:04:25,"And apparently, according to her,"
00:04:25,00:04:27,they are the only animals apart from humans
00:04:27,00:04:28,that radically transform their environment.
00:04:28,00:04:29,So it's all about safety.
00:04:29,00:04:31,They want the room perfect.
00:04:31,00:04:33,"So if you put a beaver in your room, it will be different."
00:04:33,00:04:35,- And it will flood the room.
00:04:35,00:04:36,- Yes.
00:04:36,00:04:37,- Crucially.
00:04:37,00:04:38,- What they do is they build the dams
00:04:38,00:04:41,"where they hear the water the most, right?"
00:04:41,00:04:43,'Cause they wanna find the narrow part of the river
00:04:43,00:04:44,where the water's really flowing.
00:04:44,00:04:46,So they listen out for loud water.
00:04:46,00:04:48,"When they find the loud water,"
00:04:48,00:04:49,that's where they build their dams.
00:04:49,00:04:51,But if you get a tape recorder
00:04:51,00:04:52,"and put it in the middle of the room,"
00:04:52,00:04:54,"and put a beaver in there,"
00:04:54,00:04:56,they'll go around finding any bits and pieces in the room
00:04:56,00:04:59,and then just put it all on top of the tape recorder.
00:04:59,00:05:01,"- Yeah, that's cool. - That's very cool."
00:05:01,00:05:02,"So they make dams,"
00:05:02,00:05:04,"and this can help to clean the water,"
00:05:04,00:05:06,"can it, in rivers."
00:05:06,00:05:07,"The ones in the River Otter,"
00:05:07,00:05:10,"they store 24 million liters of water,"
00:05:10,00:05:13,which is the equivalent of 10 Olympic-sized swimming pools.
00:05:13,00:05:16,"And they reckon it could help our bills, our water bills,"
00:05:16,00:05:17,"because they clean it,"
00:05:17,00:05:19,that means the water companies don't have to.
00:05:19,00:05:20,(audience laughing)
00:05:20,00:05:23,'Cause I did find that between November 2019
00:05:23,00:05:25,"and February 2020,"
00:05:25,00:05:28,sewage treatment works near Stoke illegally release sewage
00:05:28,00:05:31,equivalent to 10 Olympic-sized swimming pools.
00:05:31,00:05:33,So basically all those beavers
00:05:33,00:05:34,just did the right amount of work
00:05:34,00:05:36,to help that one sewage leak.
00:05:36,00:05:37,- That's great.
00:05:37,00:05:39,So they're the sort of water company's friend?
00:05:39,00:05:40,- Yeah. - That's nice.
00:05:40,00:05:41,I don't like them as much now.
00:05:41,00:05:43,(audience laughing)
00:05:43,00:05:45,- Do you know what a beaver deceiver is?
00:05:45,00:05:47,"- Um, is that like catfishing?"
00:05:47,00:05:48,- Is it like a...
00:05:48,00:05:49,(audience laughing)
00:05:49,00:05:50,Oh yeah.
00:05:50,00:05:52,- So it's someone who tricks a beaver in some way
00:05:52,00:05:55,into building them a dam for their own use though.
00:05:55,00:05:59,"- Basically you've got an area where you want to have beavers,"
00:05:59,00:06:01,but you don't want the area to be flooded.
00:06:01,00:06:03,"And so you allow them to build their dam,"
00:06:03,00:06:05,but then you might put a little pipe in it
00:06:05,00:06:06,"so the water can still go through,"
00:06:06,00:06:08,but they can still do their dam.
00:06:08,00:06:10,And that's called a beaver deceiver.
00:06:10,00:06:11,It's just nice to say.
00:06:11,00:06:11,- Yeah.
00:06:11,00:06:14,Was there ever a dog that was a beaver retriever?
00:06:14,00:06:16,(audience laughing)
00:06:16,00:06:17,I don't know.
00:06:17,00:06:18,(audience laughing)
00:06:18,00:06:20,"- Hey, I read a sentence about beavers"
00:06:20,00:06:22,and I wasn't able to find anything more out about it.
00:06:22,00:06:24,"So I'm just saying it in case you guys did,"
00:06:24,00:06:26,but it was such a mysterious sentence in a review
00:06:26,00:06:28,about a book on beavers.
00:06:28,00:06:32,"It said, ""Beavers never walked backwards."""
00:06:32,00:06:32,(audience laughing)
00:06:32,00:06:33,- Okay.
00:06:33,00:06:36,- Did you read the next sentence in the review?
00:06:36,00:06:38,- They eat their food twice.
00:06:38,00:06:39,(audience laughing)
00:06:39,00:06:40,- They do do that.
00:06:40,00:06:42,- They cannot doggy paddle.
00:06:42,00:06:45,They have ever growing orange teeth
00:06:45,00:06:47,with which to gnaw woody plants.
00:06:47,00:06:50,- Is this book review 10 weird facts about beavers?
00:06:50,00:06:52,(audience laughing)
00:06:52,00:06:55,"- No, it's an amazing book about the point being made"
00:06:55,00:06:58,"that beavers, actually, they don't only make dams,"
00:06:58,00:07:00,"but they made America, effectively."
00:07:00,00:07:04,America's fortunes were effectively down to beavers.
00:07:04,00:07:05,And it was fur trading.
00:07:05,00:07:07,"Beavers were virtually extinct over here, right?"
00:07:07,00:07:09,"Because they'd been hunted down, we'd used all the fur."
00:07:09,00:07:11,"And then we found out that in North America,"
00:07:11,00:07:12,there were all these beavers there.
00:07:12,00:07:15,So all the ships went over and started hunting them down.
00:07:15,00:07:18,And then you ended up with billionaires of beaver fur.
00:07:18,00:07:19,And it made America.
00:07:19,00:07:23,"- I read that it literally created Canada,"
00:07:23,00:07:25,"beaver trade, basically."
00:07:25,00:07:27,"'Cause you had all the people on the East Coast,"
00:07:27,00:07:29,and they needed to find more and more beavers.
00:07:29,00:07:31,"And so they had to go inland and inland,"
00:07:31,00:07:34,and they set up all these kind of trading posts
00:07:34,00:07:36,between all of the First Nations people.
00:07:36,00:07:39,And all those trading posts that came because of beaver pelts
00:07:39,00:07:40,was what became Canada in the end.
00:07:40,00:07:43,"- Yeah, it's very hard to underestimate"
00:07:43,00:07:44,how totally essential they were.
00:07:44,00:07:47,But when New York was sold to the Dutch
00:07:47,00:07:49,"by the Native Americans,"
00:07:49,00:07:51,I read that actually it was mostly beaver pelts
00:07:51,00:07:52,that were sold.
00:07:52,00:07:53,And New York was like a little bonus.
00:07:53,00:07:55,"They were like, ""We'll sell you 2,000 beaver pelts."
00:07:55,00:07:57,And also we've got Manhattan as well.
00:07:57,00:07:58,"Do you want this one too?"""
00:07:58,00:07:59,"And they were like, ""Yeah, okay, toss it in."""
00:07:59,00:08:01,"But yeah, crucial."
00:08:01,00:08:03,"And historically, it seems someone fair"
00:08:03,00:08:03,for such a crucial animal
00:08:03,00:08:06,that the main thing they're famous for
00:08:06,00:08:08,is taking off their testicles.
00:08:08,00:08:10,"If you Google beavers, and their name--"
00:08:10,00:08:11,- What?
00:08:11,00:08:13,- If you Google beavers with your safe search off.
00:08:14,00:08:17,You do get a lot of testicles that give you that.
00:08:17,00:08:19,- You wouldn't think testicles were the first thing.
00:08:19,00:08:21,- How did they take them off?
00:08:21,00:08:22,"- Well, I mean, they didn't take them off at all."
00:08:22,00:08:26,"But since ancient Greek, since Esop's fables,"
00:08:26,00:08:27,there was this idea that beaver testicles
00:08:27,00:08:29,"were very sought after, which they were,"
00:08:29,00:08:32,"for their medicinal qualities, which didn't exist."
00:08:32,00:08:36,"And beavers figured out that if they tore off the testicles,"
00:08:36,00:08:37,"threw them at the hunter,"
00:08:37,00:08:40,the hunter wouldn't chase after the beavers anymore.
00:08:40,00:08:43,The reason this came about is because they hide their testicles
00:08:43,00:08:45,"behind this fleshy flap, the male beavers."
00:08:45,00:08:46,- Lovely.
00:08:46,00:08:49,"- So, yes, I think fleshy flap is the term."
00:08:49,00:08:51,"And so, people were like, where are their testicles?"
00:08:51,00:08:54,They must have torn them off because of this reason.
00:08:54,00:08:56,But it's where the name comes from.
00:08:56,00:08:59,So castorium is the stuff they secrete.
00:08:59,00:09:02,Their name is castor in the Latin name.
00:09:02,00:09:04,"And that's from castrated, same origin."
00:09:04,00:09:06,'Cause the idea was they ripped off their testicles.
00:09:06,00:09:08,"- When I was kid in Bolton,"
00:09:08,00:09:09,we used to shout beaver in the streets.
00:09:09,00:09:12,"If we ever saw anyone with a beard, you did beavering."
00:09:12,00:09:13,- This is so exciting.
00:09:13,00:09:15,"- Literally, we would walk down the road"
00:09:15,00:09:17,and there was someone with a beard
00:09:17,00:09:21,and the first person to spot them would shout beaver.
00:09:21,00:09:21,- Right.
00:09:21,00:09:23,- I read that this was a game popular
00:09:23,00:09:25,in the 1910s and 1920s.
00:09:25,00:09:28,(audience laughing)
00:09:28,00:09:30,- I believe that is the case in the rest of the country.
00:09:30,00:09:32,(audience laughing)
00:09:32,00:09:33,- What would beavering survive?
00:09:33,00:09:36,"- What would the beaver do, what would they say?"
00:09:36,00:09:38,"- Well, they would be confused."
00:09:38,00:09:40,"They would be like, that game hasn't been popular"
00:09:40,00:09:45,since the 1920s and were there variations for you?
00:09:45,00:09:46,- I can't remember.
00:09:46,00:09:48,I was really young when it happened.
00:09:48,00:09:49,"It wasn't literally in the 1920s,"
00:09:49,00:09:51,"but yeah, I was really young when it happened."
00:09:51,00:09:53,- 'Cause supposedly there were things like
00:09:53,00:09:55,"if someone had a beard and a moustache,"
00:09:55,00:09:59,"that was a royal beaver or there was a king beaver,"
00:09:59,00:10:00,"which is a red, whiskered policeman"
00:10:00,00:10:02,riding a green bicycle.
00:10:02,00:10:04,(audience laughing)
00:10:04,00:10:05,And I just wondered if you knew the--
00:10:05,00:10:06,"- No, I didn't know the nose."
00:10:06,00:10:09,But my theory is that the use of beaver
00:10:09,00:10:13,for women's genitals is from that game.
00:10:13,00:10:14,I'm pretty sure it is.
00:10:14,00:10:18,Because the first citation of that is from 1927.
00:10:18,00:10:21,And the citation in the Oxford English Dictionary says
00:10:21,00:10:24,she took off her clothes from her head to her toes
00:10:24,00:10:27,and the voice at the keyhole yelled beaver.
00:10:27,00:10:28,- Right.
00:10:28,00:10:30,- So it genuinely seems like that might be it.
00:10:30,00:10:31,- Yeah.
00:10:31,00:10:33,"Well, I'll tell you what, Canada in 1920,"
00:10:33,00:10:35,that was the year that what is now
00:10:35,00:10:38,their second oldest magazine ever was founded.
00:10:38,00:10:40,It was called The Beaver.
00:10:40,00:10:43,And it lasted all the way until 2010
00:10:43,00:10:45,"until it needed to change its name,"
00:10:45,00:10:47,which they've just changed to Canada's history.
00:10:47,00:10:50,And it was largely because none of their emails
00:10:50,00:10:51,were getting through to anyone
00:10:51,00:10:53,because they were being filtered out by foreign filters.
00:10:53,00:10:54,(audience laughing)
00:10:54,00:10:56,"So all of their emails, all their newsletters,"
00:10:56,00:10:58,nothing reaching it.
00:10:58,00:11:00,People were confused anyway about it.
00:11:00,00:11:02,- Same as Beaver College in Pennsylvania.
00:11:02,00:11:03,- Really?
00:11:03,00:11:04,"- They changed their name because, again,"
00:11:04,00:11:06,that no one could get to their website.
00:11:06,00:11:09,"- Plus the applicants they got were questionable,"
00:11:09,00:11:10,to say the least.
00:11:10,00:11:11,(laughing)
00:11:11,00:11:12,- So there wasn't an attempt before now
00:11:12,00:11:14,to reintroduce beavers to the UK
00:11:14,00:11:16,'cause I think there were some hundreds of thousands
00:11:16,00:11:18,in the Middle Ages.
00:11:18,00:11:21,Europe had about between 60 and 400 million beavers.
00:11:21,00:11:23,So I think that's a sign that no one really knows
00:11:23,00:11:24,how many there were.
00:11:24,00:11:27,But there were attempts to reintroduce them
00:11:27,00:11:28,"'cause they clung on a few,"
00:11:28,00:11:32,and like really far Eastern sort of like central Asian step
00:11:32,00:11:33,that there were a few beavers knocking around.
00:11:33,00:11:34,- Right.
00:11:34,00:11:36,"- And in the 1860s, there wasn't an attempt"
00:11:36,00:11:38,to re-beaver in Suffolk and--
00:11:38,00:11:40,- Is that the technical term?
00:11:40,00:11:41,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:11:41,00:11:42,- To re-beaver.
00:11:42,00:11:43,"- Re-beaver, yeah, yeah."
00:11:43,00:11:45,"But they were de-beavered, they were destroyed."
00:11:45,00:11:47,(laughing)
00:11:47,00:11:48,"And the very final ones, I just like this,"
00:11:48,00:11:51,were sent to London to be stuffed by Lady Gooch.
00:11:51,00:11:53,(laughing)
00:11:53,00:11:55,"- That sounds like another euphemism, doesn't it?"
00:11:55,00:11:57,- How was that not your headline fact?
00:11:57,00:11:58,(laughing)
00:11:58,00:12:01,Beavers used to be stuffed by Lady Gooch.
00:12:01,00:12:03,(upbeat music)
00:12:03,00:12:06,(upbeat music)
00:12:06,00:12:11,"- It is time for fact number two, and that is Anna."
00:12:11,00:12:14,"- My fact this week is that in the 1600s,"
00:12:14,00:12:17,the Spanish ambassador to England had a specially made chair
00:12:17,00:12:21,with a hole in the bottom to accommodate his anal fistula.
00:12:21,00:12:22,(laughing)
00:12:22,00:12:23,"- Wow, hmm."
00:12:23,00:12:27,"- Yeah, this is such a good article that I read."
00:12:27,00:12:29,"It was on history today, and it was about a play"
00:12:29,00:12:32,"called A Game at Chess, which is the most popular play"
00:12:32,00:12:33,of the 1600s.
00:12:33,00:12:35,Most of you won't remember it.
00:12:35,00:12:36,The main--
00:12:36,00:12:37,- Still big in Bolton.
00:12:37,00:12:39,(laughing)
00:12:39,00:12:42,- The main villain in it is a guy called Diego Sarmiento
00:12:42,00:12:47,"de Acuña, or Count Gondemar, who was the Spanish ambassador"
00:12:47,00:12:50,"to England between 1613 and 1622,"
00:12:50,00:12:54,and he had an anal fistula that was very famous.
00:12:54,00:12:56,"And I just think if you've got an anal fistula,"
00:12:56,00:12:57,you don't want it to be famous.
00:12:57,00:12:59,"It impacted his movement, and--"
00:12:59,00:13:02,"- It's hard to say how famous it was, isn't it?"
00:13:02,00:13:05,"- Right, literally everyone in the country knew about it."
00:13:05,00:13:08,"- Their posters on their bedroom wall, it was--"
00:13:08,00:13:09,- But how many people can even name
00:13:09,00:13:11,the Spanish ambassador now?
00:13:11,00:13:14,It's a job that has undergone a huge decline in prestige
00:13:14,00:13:15,in the last 400 years.
00:13:15,00:13:15,- Right.
00:13:15,00:13:17,"- Yeah, it's since we weren't at war with Spain anymore."
00:13:17,00:13:18,- Exactly.
00:13:18,00:13:19,- Yeah.
00:13:19,00:13:20,"- Exactly, but I just think that's really tragic."
00:13:20,00:13:21,I looked up the current--
00:13:21,00:13:22,- We're not at war with Spain anymore?
00:13:22,00:13:23,(laughing)
00:13:23,00:13:25,"- I'm willing to say, ""Wow, come and have a go."""
00:13:25,00:13:27,(laughing)
00:13:27,00:13:30,"Well, no, I just think it's as in,"
00:13:30,00:13:32,I looked up the Spanish ambassador to the UK earlier.
00:13:32,00:13:34,I've forgotten his name.
00:13:34,00:13:35,"- Right, yeah."
00:13:35,00:13:37,"- It's definitely Spanish, but I just mean--"
00:13:37,00:13:37,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:13:37,00:13:38,- I think it's a shame for him.
00:13:38,00:13:40,"And when you say an anal fistula,"
00:13:40,00:13:43,"I actually would like a quick sense check on what that is,"
00:13:43,00:13:44,"because I like the way you said in your fact,"
00:13:44,00:13:46,"his chair had a hole in the bottom,"
00:13:46,00:13:47,"because as far as I can tell,"
00:13:47,00:13:49,"that is what one of those is, right?"
00:13:49,00:13:51,(laughing)
00:13:51,00:13:52,But it's a sort of extra hole in the bottom.
00:13:52,00:13:53,"- Yeah, it's one too many."
00:13:53,00:13:54,- Right.
00:13:54,00:13:55,- Right.
00:13:55,00:13:57,- A fistula is a hole basically between two tubes.
00:13:57,00:13:58,- Yeah.
00:13:58,00:13:58,- It's a gap where there shouldn't be a gap.
00:13:58,00:13:59,- Yeah.
00:13:59,00:14:01,- The hole in the bottom of the chair
00:14:01,00:14:02,was not 'cause he had something hanging out
00:14:02,00:14:04,"that had to drop through it,"
00:14:04,00:14:05,"which is kind of what you assume, I think,"
00:14:05,00:14:07,when you hear me say that.
00:14:07,00:14:10,It's because it would be so sensitive and painful.
00:14:10,00:14:11,And he also had to be carried through the streets
00:14:11,00:14:12,"of London on a sedan chair,"
00:14:12,00:14:14,'cause everyone hated him so much
00:14:14,00:14:16,"that they would attack him if he was carried,"
00:14:16,00:14:16,"you know, if he walked."
00:14:16,00:14:17,- Really?
00:14:17,00:14:18,- Plus it was quite hard to walk with a fistula.
00:14:18,00:14:21,"- Well, like kick him in the bum kind of thing, as a--"
00:14:21,00:14:22,"- I think that would probably be one of the tactics, yeah."
00:14:22,00:14:23,- Yeah.
00:14:23,00:14:25,- Surely something to make you less likable
00:14:25,00:14:26,is having yourself carried through the streets of London
00:14:26,00:14:28,in a sedan chair.
00:14:28,00:14:31,- Surely just wear a hat and go out and just...
00:14:31,00:14:34,"- When you say it doesn't, a secret..."
00:14:34,00:14:35,- No.
00:14:35,00:14:35,"- Well, it does."
00:14:35,00:14:37,"I mean, it does, and it is an unpleasant condition."
00:14:37,00:14:41,"- But not feces, it doesn't act as a second bum hole."
00:14:41,00:14:41,It acts as a second bum hole.
00:14:41,00:14:42,"- Yeah, yeah, of course."
00:14:42,00:14:45,Because basically it's caused by some sort of infection.
00:14:45,00:14:46,"Sorry for the gory details,"
00:14:46,00:14:49,but it's important to know if you have one.
00:14:49,00:14:52,"An infection somewhere in the anal tract,"
00:14:52,00:14:53,"and there's a bunch of pus builds up,"
00:14:53,00:14:55,"and then when it goes away, it leaves a little tunnel"
00:14:55,00:14:58,that goes from the anal tract out of the sort of button.
00:14:58,00:14:59,"Right near the bum hole,"
00:14:59,00:15:01,and so it will leak things from your bow.
00:15:01,00:15:04,- Most of my stuff is about Spanish foreign policy.
00:15:04,00:15:05,- Right.
00:15:05,00:15:06,(audience laughing)
00:15:06,00:15:08,"- Do you guys remember when my wife, Fenella,"
00:15:08,00:15:11,"thought that my oldest son, Will, had a second bum hole?"
00:15:11,00:15:12,(audience laughing)
00:15:12,00:15:13,- No.
00:15:13,00:15:16,It was in the first few weeks after he had been born.
00:15:16,00:15:17,"It was our first child,"
00:15:17,00:15:19,"and you have to change the nappy every few hours, right?"
00:15:19,00:15:21,"So you're getting up at like two a.m., four a.m."
00:15:21,00:15:23,"I got up at like two or four,"
00:15:23,00:15:24,"and I was going to change the nappy,"
00:15:24,00:15:25,"and Fenella said to me,"
00:15:25,00:15:27,"""Don't forget to wipe a second bum."""
00:15:27,00:15:28,"And I said, ""Excuse me?"""
00:15:28,00:15:31,"And she said, ""His second bum hole, don't forget so,"
00:15:31,00:15:34,"""because it could get infected if you don't wipe it properly."""
00:15:34,00:15:36,"And I said, ""What do you mean?"""
00:15:36,00:15:37,"And basically newborn babies,"
00:15:37,00:15:39,"they have a little dent that's right at the top,"
00:15:39,00:15:42,but she thought that that was an actual other bum hole.
00:15:42,00:15:45,This is how tired and sleep deprived she was.
00:15:45,00:15:47,- What did she think was going to happen to this
00:15:47,00:15:47,in the fullness of time?
00:15:47,00:15:49,Does she think there are people walking
00:15:49,00:15:50,among us who have this?
00:15:50,00:15:52,"- I said to her, I was like,"
00:15:52,00:15:53,"""How did you think that was possible?"""
00:15:53,00:15:55,"And she was like, ""I don't know how boys work."
00:15:55,00:15:56,"""I don't know what you have."""
00:15:56,00:15:58,(audience laughing)
00:15:58,00:15:58,- That's fair.
00:15:58,00:15:59,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:15:59,00:16:02,"- So the Spanish in the 1600s,"
00:16:02,00:16:05,(audience laughing)
00:16:05,00:16:06,"they had been at war with Britain,"
00:16:06,00:16:08,"or with England, I should say."
00:16:08,00:16:12,"And this guy, Gondama, who was the ambassador,"
00:16:12,00:16:14,he'd come to the English court
00:16:14,00:16:17,and he'd become really best friends with King James.
00:16:17,00:16:18,They were super close.
00:16:18,00:16:20,"And because they were so close,"
00:16:20,00:16:23,he started making James do lots of policies
00:16:23,00:16:25,that were very pro-Spanish.
00:16:25,00:16:27,And it eventually came to the extent
00:16:27,00:16:31,"where he forced James to execute Walter Raleigh,"
00:16:31,00:16:33,because so Walter Raleigh had been a pirate
00:16:33,00:16:36,and attacking some Spanish ships.
00:16:36,00:16:37,"And he said, ""Well, we're gonna go to war"
00:16:37,00:16:39,"""unless you execute him."""
00:16:39,00:16:41,"James first said, ""Okay, fine, you're my best mate."
00:16:41,00:16:42,"""I will do it."""
00:16:42,00:16:43,"And then obviously, everyone hated him"
00:16:43,00:16:44,from that moment.
00:16:44,00:16:45,- It's just incredible.
00:16:45,00:16:47,"- Yeah, the Spanish ambassador has the power"
00:16:47,00:16:48,to ask the king.
00:16:48,00:16:50,"- Well, we don't know that he did."
00:16:50,00:16:53,- Imagine if King Charles executed Alan Titchmarsh
00:16:53,00:16:57,on the orders of whoever the Spanish ambassador is now.
00:16:57,00:16:59,"I was just trying to think of a beloved national figure,"
00:16:59,00:17:00,like a national figurehead.
00:17:00,00:17:03,- Alan Titchmarsh isn't attacking Spanish possessions.
00:17:03,00:17:06,"At most, he's buying up some Spanish plants."
00:17:06,00:17:08,"- Okay, it's a bad example."
00:17:08,00:17:10,- Did you guys read the account
00:17:10,00:17:11,of the execution of Walter Raleigh?
00:17:11,00:17:12,- No.
00:17:12,00:17:13,- That's sort of alluded to.
00:17:13,00:17:14,He was incredibly popular.
00:17:14,00:17:17,"He was like the fanciable, you know,"
00:17:17,00:17:19,Clive Owen or whatever of his day.
00:17:19,00:17:22,"And PR-wise, he nailed the execution."
00:17:22,00:17:25,So it was pretty dodgy grounds
00:17:25,00:17:27,on which he was sentenced to death for treason.
00:17:27,00:17:28,"The morning of his execution,"
00:17:28,00:17:30,he had this huge breakfast.
00:17:30,00:17:31,He was puffing on his pipe.
00:17:31,00:17:32,He had a glass of wine.
00:17:32,00:17:34,He made a joke about it.
00:17:34,00:17:36,"He went up to the scaffold and he said,"
00:17:36,00:17:38,"""Sorry, do you mind if I just say a few words"
00:17:38,00:17:39,"""at the scaffold?"""
00:17:39,00:17:41,He made a 25-minute speech.
00:17:41,00:17:44,Full of sort of charm and laughs and warmth.
00:17:44,00:17:47,"At one point, he sensed that the nobles on the balcony"
00:17:47,00:17:48,couldn't hear him properly.
00:17:48,00:17:50,And so he invited them all onto the scaffold with him
00:17:50,00:17:52,and started the speech again.
00:17:52,00:17:54,So that they could hear it properly.
00:17:54,00:17:56,"And he shook all of their hands, saying,"
00:17:56,00:17:58,"""Hello, how are you, how's your wife?"""
00:17:58,00:17:59,All of that.
00:17:59,00:18:00,"At one point, the sheriff said,"
00:18:00,00:18:02,"""Do you want to come and warm yourself by the fire"
00:18:02,00:18:04,"""while you give this speech?"""
00:18:04,00:18:06,"And he said, ""No, I'm getting a bit sick,"
00:18:06,00:18:09,"""so I want to get this over with before I get ill again."""
00:18:09,00:18:12,And then he apologized to his executioner
00:18:12,00:18:14,for going on so long.
00:18:14,00:18:16,And then popped his head under the ax and went.
00:18:16,00:18:17,"- Really? - Which, you know,"
00:18:17,00:18:19,if you're going to go and style.
00:18:19,00:18:20,- It does feel like he was leading up
00:18:20,00:18:21,to something incredibly clever.
00:18:21,00:18:23,- That's the shame of it.
00:18:23,00:18:25,"- You know, one person who, I was trying to,"
00:18:25,00:18:27,I was really hoping there was a Wikipedia article
00:18:27,00:18:30,which was notable people with anal fistulas.
00:18:30,00:18:32,"And it wasn't, it wasn't there."
00:18:32,00:18:34,It's kind of the thing Wiki sometimes has.
00:18:34,00:18:36,"But one person, if the page did exist,"
00:18:36,00:18:38,"that would belong on there, is Charles Dickens."
00:18:38,00:18:39,- Oh.
00:18:39,00:18:40,- Dickens had a fistula.
00:18:40,00:18:41,- Interesting.
00:18:41,00:18:44,"- Yeah, and he had it very early on in his career."
00:18:44,00:18:46,And there's an argument that had it not
00:18:46,00:18:49,"had been sorted out by a pioneering doctor at the time,"
00:18:49,00:18:51,"who was called Frederick Salmon,"
00:18:51,00:18:54,then we might not have had all the subsequent books
00:18:54,00:18:56,that he wrote because he was so debilitated by it.
00:18:56,00:18:59,He used to have to dictate to his then wife
00:18:59,00:19:00,and she would write down.
00:19:00,00:19:02,"But he couldn't, he just couldn't think properly"
00:19:02,00:19:03,with all that going on.
00:19:03,00:19:04,"So this guy, Frederick Salmon,"
00:19:04,00:19:06,because it was a dangerous operation back in the day.
00:19:06,00:19:07,This guy was amazing.
00:19:07,00:19:09,"He set up his hospital, which was called"
00:19:09,00:19:11,"the Infirmary for Relief of the Poor,"
00:19:11,00:19:15,afflicted with fistulas and the diseases of the rectum.
00:19:15,00:19:16,"It was called that until someone said,"
00:19:16,00:19:17,why don't we just call it St. Mark's?
00:19:17,00:19:19,They changed it to that.
00:19:19,00:19:20,(audience laughing)
00:19:20,00:19:23,"And he carried out over 3,500 operations,"
00:19:23,00:19:24,one of which was Dickens.
00:19:24,00:19:25,"And as a result, he was fixed."
00:19:25,00:19:28,And then he went on to being able to sit down
00:19:28,00:19:29,and write his book.
00:19:29,00:19:30,- That's great.
00:19:30,00:19:31,"- And Dickens, in those days, no NHS."
00:19:31,00:19:33,So he had to pay for his operation.
00:19:33,00:19:34,And he paid for his operation
00:19:34,00:19:37,with several autographed copies of the Pickwick papers.
00:19:37,00:19:39,"- Hmm, they've not accepted"
00:19:39,00:19:42,impossible things as payment at my private doctors.
00:19:42,00:19:45,- The most famous surgeon of fistulas
00:19:45,00:19:48,in the 18th century was Martin Van Butchel.
00:19:48,00:19:49,He was--
00:19:49,00:19:52,"- That's very, very disconcerting for the patients."
00:19:52,00:19:54,"- Well, he would put loads of adverts on."
00:19:54,00:19:56,He had amazing advertising.
00:19:56,00:19:57,He was most famous 'cause he enjoyed riding
00:19:57,00:20:00,"around Hyde Park on a white pony,"
00:20:00,00:20:02,which he often painted purple.
00:20:02,00:20:03,- Oh.
00:20:03,00:20:04,(audience laughing)
00:20:04,00:20:05,- And he had a really long beard
00:20:05,00:20:08,and he always carried a large white bone around with him.
00:20:08,00:20:09,- Bone?
00:20:09,00:20:10,- Bone.
00:20:10,00:20:11,"You know, like Fred Flintstone might."
00:20:11,00:20:13,"- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:20:13,00:20:14,- And his wife died.
00:20:14,00:20:16,"She was killed by the Nazis, actually."
00:20:16,00:20:19,"Well, she died in 1775."
00:20:19,00:20:19,- Yeah.
00:20:19,00:20:22,"- And Butchel asked his friend, John Hunter,"
00:20:22,00:20:24,to preserve the body.
00:20:24,00:20:25,And then he put the body on display
00:20:25,00:20:29,as kind of advertising for his fistula company.
00:20:29,00:20:33,- Lot of questionable decisions being made in this.
00:20:33,00:20:35,- The body was described soon afterwards
00:20:35,00:20:37,as a repulsive looking object.
00:20:37,00:20:38,And eventually he had to get rid of it
00:20:38,00:20:40,when his second wife objected.
00:20:40,00:20:43,"- Oh, that is fussy."
00:20:43,00:20:45,(audience laughing)
00:20:45,00:20:47,- His wife's preserved corpse was on display
00:20:47,00:20:50,in the college in Lincoln's Infields
00:20:50,00:20:54,until 1941 when it was bombed by the Nazis.
00:20:54,00:20:55,- Ah.
00:20:55,00:20:56,- It was not the target.
00:20:56,00:20:57,(audience laughing)
00:20:57,00:20:58,- It's too creepy.
00:20:58,00:21:00,Get rid of it.
00:21:00,00:21:02,"- This play, by the way, is so fascinating"
00:21:02,00:21:03,because it was 1600s.
00:21:03,00:21:05,This was performed at the Globe.
00:21:05,00:21:08,Like this was the original Shakespearean theater.
00:21:08,00:21:11,"And the play itself, the plot is amazing."
00:21:11,00:21:13,It was literally as if you were watching
00:21:13,00:21:14,"a live game of chess, right?"
00:21:14,00:21:16,"- Yeah, and the play, this is the play"
00:21:16,00:21:17,that took the piss out of Condomard.
00:21:17,00:21:18,"- Yes, exactly."
00:21:18,00:21:20,"And so when the play started,"
00:21:20,00:21:23,people very quickly realized that this was a satire
00:21:23,00:21:24,of the ambassador.
00:21:24,00:21:26,And so they had to get word to the king
00:21:26,00:21:27,in order to ban it.
00:21:27,00:21:30,And they specifically put this play on at a point
00:21:30,00:21:31,when the king went away.
00:21:31,00:21:33,So it took about nine days to get to him.
00:21:33,00:21:35,So multiple performances were happening.
00:21:35,00:21:36,They couldn't stop it from happening.
00:21:36,00:21:38,So it was such a hit job
00:21:38,00:21:40,and it was done in Shakespeare's Globe.
00:21:40,00:21:41,- And it was massively popular.
00:21:41,00:21:42,It's mad.
00:21:42,00:21:44,- Everyone got the allegory.
00:21:44,00:21:46,A seventh of the population of London
00:21:46,00:21:47,saw it in nine days.
00:21:47,00:21:49,"The chess piece, which I think was the Black Knight"
00:21:49,00:21:51,"who represented Condomard,"
00:21:51,00:21:54,was referred to as the fistula of Europe
00:21:54,00:21:55,during the play.
00:21:55,00:22:00,"And 50 years later, in the 1660s or 1670s,"
00:22:00,00:22:02,people were still referring to the fistula of Europe
00:22:02,00:22:04,and everyone knew what they meant.
00:22:04,00:22:05,- Right.
00:22:05,00:22:06,- Imagine that.
00:22:06,00:22:07,- Did he see it?
00:22:07,00:22:07,Was he there?
00:22:07,00:22:08,- I don't think he was.
00:22:08,00:22:11,I think he had retired as ambassador by that point.
00:22:11,00:22:13,"It was his successor as ambassador,"
00:22:13,00:22:15,who was a guy called Coloma who complained about it.
00:22:15,00:22:17,The play has a lot of scatological humor
00:22:17,00:22:20,"and it has a lot of rude, wind-based puns."
00:22:20,00:22:22,And I was reading an article analyzing the play
00:22:22,00:22:25,"in a book called ""Theatre in Post-Reformation London."""
00:22:25,00:22:27,"And I just want to read you this sentence,"
00:22:27,00:22:28,"which I just really liked,"
00:22:28,00:22:31,"to adapt Anton, oh, so by the way,"
00:22:31,00:22:32,they bring on his fake seat.
00:22:32,00:22:34,"They bring on the fistula seat,"
00:22:34,00:22:35,which looks exactly like a loose seat.
00:22:35,00:22:36,That's the thing.
00:22:36,00:22:37,Here's the line.
00:22:37,00:22:39,To adapt Anton Chekhov's maxim
00:22:39,00:22:43,"that when a gun is introduced into a play, it must be fired."
00:22:43,00:22:46,"I propose that when a toilet is brought on stage,"
00:22:46,00:22:48,there must be farts.
00:22:48,00:22:49,(audience laughing)
00:22:49,00:22:50,- Lovely.
00:22:50,00:22:51,- Who would've thought?
00:22:51,00:22:52,"He sounds very sinister, Condomar."
00:22:52,00:22:54,"He does, I mean, in all, you know,"
00:22:54,00:22:55,it would like titch my stuff aside.
00:22:55,00:22:58,"I think he does sound, he tried to intimidate people."
00:22:58,00:23:00,He had himself painted as Machiavelli.
00:23:00,00:23:02,- But apparently Machiavellian wasn't a word
00:23:02,00:23:03,that was used to describe someone
00:23:03,00:23:05,who was Machiavellian until him.
00:23:05,00:23:06,So that got applied to him.
00:23:06,00:23:08,"And then everyone was like, that's a great term."
00:23:08,00:23:10,- We use that for other things now.
00:23:10,00:23:11,"So he's done good things as well, right?"
00:23:11,00:23:14,- He married his niece.
00:23:14,00:23:16,"He's done great things, as one tried to say."
00:23:16,00:23:18,He married his niece and then his cousin.
00:23:18,00:23:20,He definitely had a type.
00:23:20,00:23:22,(audience laughing)
00:23:22,00:23:24,"- Yeah, that's terrible."
00:23:24,00:23:26,"- No, that's not that close."
00:23:26,00:23:27,- His niece?
00:23:27,00:23:29,"- His niece is pretty close, I know."
00:23:29,00:23:31,"- It was the 1500s, if you do 1600s,"
00:23:31,00:23:34,"if you didn't marry a niece, you're a weirdo."
00:23:34,00:23:35,"- How is your uncle, by the way?"
00:23:35,00:23:37,(audience laughing)
00:23:37,00:23:40,- My four-legged child is doing very well as well.
00:23:40,00:23:40,Thank you.
00:23:40,00:23:41,(audience laughing)
00:23:41,00:23:42,- Bubbles from here to breakfast.
00:23:42,00:23:45,(audience laughing)
00:23:45,00:23:47,(upbeat music)
00:23:47,00:23:55,"- It is time for fact number three, and that is James."
00:23:55,00:23:59,"- Okay, my fact this week is that in 1930s Canada,"
00:23:59,00:24:02,the Mounties dealt with illegal nudists
00:24:02,00:24:05,by covering them in itching powder.
00:24:05,00:24:08,"That is a very, how did they get close enough to apply,"
00:24:08,00:24:11,"as in the Mounties or on horseback, I think of them as?"
00:24:11,00:24:13,"- That's the Mountie part of them, the Mounted."
00:24:13,00:24:15,- Did they just scatter it?
00:24:15,00:24:17,"- Yeah, I think they threw it."
00:24:17,00:24:22,"This was the Dukobas who were a group of 7,500 Russians"
00:24:22,00:24:26,who arrived in Canada 'cause they'd been persecuted
00:24:26,00:24:29,"in Russia, and there was a small group of them"
00:24:29,00:24:31,"who insisted on going naked all the time,"
00:24:31,00:24:33,kind of for their religion.
00:24:33,00:24:35,They kind of thought it was getting closer
00:24:35,00:24:37,"to Adam and Eve and all that kind of stuff,"
00:24:37,00:24:40,"and going naked was also a way to protest,"
00:24:40,00:24:42,so they didn't really want their children
00:24:42,00:24:45,"to go to the state schools, but they were forced to do so,"
00:24:45,00:24:47,and so they went naked.
00:24:47,00:24:49,"- Obviously, the obvious protest against not wanting"
00:24:49,00:24:51,"your children to go to the state school,"
00:24:51,00:24:53,"they wanted to keep in their communal living,"
00:24:53,00:24:56,"they didn't want to be forced into state housing,"
00:24:56,00:24:59,"so they went naked, and even if their own leaders"
00:24:59,00:25:02,"did things that they didn't really like, they went naked."
00:25:02,00:25:06,"And the Canadian government decided this is not a good idea,"
00:25:06,00:25:09,"so not only did they do this thing with the itching powder,"
00:25:09,00:25:12,"but eventually, just due to what was happening here,"
00:25:12,00:25:17,the Canadian parliament outlawed public nudity in 1932
00:25:17,00:25:19,as a result of the Dukobas.
00:25:19,00:25:19,"- Yeah, right."
00:25:19,00:25:24,- Itching powder is more of a schoolboy 1940s prank thing
00:25:24,00:25:26,than a kind of legally imposed thing.
00:25:26,00:25:28,Do we know what the itching powder was?
00:25:28,00:25:29,Was it the old rose hips?
00:25:29,00:25:31,"- Yeah, I don't know which one it was."
00:25:31,00:25:32,"I suspect it was rose hips,"
00:25:32,00:25:34,just thinking about where they are.
00:25:34,00:25:36,"- 'Cause it's not that bad a punishment, is it?"
00:25:36,00:25:38,Especially if you're naked.
00:25:38,00:25:39,I think the worst is when it gets in your clothes.
00:25:39,00:25:40,"- Well, you're just trying to deter people, right?"
00:25:40,00:25:42,"Like, we've spoken about this on the podcast before,"
00:25:42,00:25:46,where it was used by Churchill's brain box
00:25:46,00:25:47,where they were coming.
00:25:47,00:25:49,"You know, all these amazing ideas they were coming up with"
00:25:49,00:25:51,"that would subtly get to the Nazis,"
00:25:51,00:25:53,"they were putting it in their clothes,"
00:25:53,00:25:55,"they were putting it in their condoms,"
00:25:55,00:25:56,they were just itching powder.
00:25:56,00:25:57,- These were things that were tried in the Second World War.
00:25:57,00:25:58,"- Yeah, exactly."
00:25:58,00:26:01,"Like, it's just, it's a deterrent, isn't it?"
00:26:01,00:26:02,And...
00:26:02,00:26:03,- That's why we won the war.
00:26:03,00:26:05,Itching powder in the condoms.
00:26:05,00:26:07,"- The condom thing is quite clever, isn't it?"
00:26:07,00:26:09,Because you put your itching powder in the condoms
00:26:09,00:26:11,and they get itchy down below
00:26:11,00:26:13,"and they think, well, I must have lice"
00:26:13,00:26:16,or I must have an STD or something like that.
00:26:16,00:26:19,"And quite often, if a lot of people in a platoon"
00:26:19,00:26:20,"got an STD,"
00:26:20,00:26:22,then they were all kind of taken away from the front.
00:26:22,00:26:23,- Really?
00:26:23,00:26:26,"- So I did read, I was on the website powderbolksolids.com,"
00:26:26,00:26:28,which is a great guide to historical powders.
00:26:28,00:26:31,And they mentioned especially the itching powder
00:26:31,00:26:35,was smuggled into Germany
00:26:35,00:26:39,and particularly into the uniforms of the German army.
00:26:39,00:26:41,"So, particularly the Navy as well."
00:26:41,00:26:44,So there was at least one U-boat
00:26:44,00:26:46,had to turn around and come home
00:26:46,00:26:49,because everyone on board was just itching so much.
00:26:49,00:26:51,"- And again, they just assumed it was fleas."
00:26:51,00:26:52,"- Yeah, of course."
00:26:52,00:26:54,"- So you're in a submarine, you're itching so much,"
00:26:54,00:26:55,"you think we must have a flea outbreak here,"
00:26:55,00:26:57,"we're gonna have to go back to land,"
00:26:57,00:27:00,"clean all our clothes, but actually it was itching powder."
00:27:00,00:27:02,"- Oh, there was itching powder for trains as well"
00:27:02,00:27:03,in the Second World War.
00:27:03,00:27:04,That was the thing you could do.
00:27:04,00:27:05,- So what would you do?
00:27:05,00:27:07,- It was a special powder called carburandum.
00:27:07,00:27:08,It was incredibly fine.
00:27:08,00:27:10,"And if you mix it with lubricating oil,"
00:27:10,00:27:12,it basically gums up an entire engine.
00:27:12,00:27:14,"It's a really, really effective way"
00:27:14,00:27:17,"of just jamming a machine to a stop, effectively."
00:27:17,00:27:18,- Is that itching?
00:27:18,00:27:20,How is that itching?
00:27:20,00:27:23,"- Well, it's, you know, I imagine the trains,"
00:27:23,00:27:25,I imagine the train would feel pretty itchy after that.
00:27:25,00:27:27,- That's the train equivalent of itching.
00:27:27,00:27:28,"- It's the train equivalent of itching, that's so fascinating."
00:27:28,00:27:29,"- Yeah, all right."
00:27:29,00:27:32,But that was done in 1944 in June.
00:27:32,00:27:35,Two teenage French sisters applied a load
00:27:35,00:27:37,of carburandum powder to a train
00:27:37,00:27:40,that gummed up the tank supply to Normandy.
00:27:40,00:27:40,- Wow.
00:27:40,00:27:42,"- So it's quite, that was an incredibly effective maneuver"
00:27:42,00:27:43,"at that time, yeah, yeah."
00:27:43,00:27:46,- It was also important in the Second World War
00:27:46,00:27:48,because of where it comes from.
00:27:48,00:27:50,"So rose hips are the standard itching powder, right?"
00:27:50,00:27:52,"When I was a kid, it was always like, you know,"
00:27:52,00:27:54,you should spread the seeds on someone from a rose hip
00:27:54,00:27:56,"and it'll be very, very itchy."
00:27:56,00:27:57,That's what most itching powder is made out of.
00:27:57,00:27:59,Did you guys used to do that?
00:27:59,00:27:59,- I never did.
00:27:59,00:28:00,- No.
00:28:00,00:28:02,"- Oh, Andy, you had it done to you."
00:28:02,00:28:05,(audience laughs)
00:28:05,00:28:08,"And you thought you had fleas, all of your teenagers."
00:28:08,00:28:10,"- Oh, the drugs on them, 'cause I also had fleas."
00:28:10,00:28:12,(audience laughs)
00:28:12,00:28:15,- But they're also an incredibly good source of vitamin C.
00:28:15,00:28:17,"So I love, they're one of the few things you can eat"
00:28:17,00:28:19,and we're just coming up to rose hip season.
00:28:19,00:28:19,It's in winter.
00:28:19,00:28:21,How many berries can you eat in winter?
00:28:21,00:28:23,"And you squeeze the, you know, the red juice out"
00:28:23,00:28:24,and it's delicious.
00:28:24,00:28:27,But it has 20 times more vitamin C than oranges.
00:28:27,00:28:30,"And in World War II, oranges in short supply"
00:28:30,00:28:32,because we couldn't import many things.
00:28:32,00:28:35,And so the government ran this huge rose hip collection
00:28:35,00:28:38,campaign and they organized whole days
00:28:38,00:28:40,when they sent out Boy Scouts and school children
00:28:40,00:28:43,and WI people to go and collect rose hips
00:28:43,00:28:45,and turn it into syrup.
00:28:45,00:28:49,And I think they collected 134 million hips.
00:28:49,00:28:50,"- Wow, that's great."
00:28:50,00:28:51,"- Not around here though, I don't think,"
00:28:51,00:28:53,"'cause they had ribena, right?"
00:28:53,00:28:56,'Cause wasn't ribena invented in Bristol?
00:28:56,00:28:57,Yeah.
00:28:57,00:29:00,"And I think they, it was invented here for World War II"
00:29:00,00:29:02,"because there weren't many oranges,"
00:29:02,00:29:03,just as a vitamin C thing.
00:29:03,00:29:06,And I think they gave it free to kids.
00:29:06,00:29:07,"- Wow, did they?"
00:29:07,00:29:07,"- Ribena, yeah."
00:29:07,00:29:08,- That's great.
00:29:08,00:29:09,"- Wow, that's awesome."
00:29:09,00:29:12,The Duk Horvos of Canada.
00:29:12,00:29:16,"So those who left Russia and they set up this,"
00:29:16,00:29:18,"this basically thing, that word is basically,"
00:29:18,00:29:20,it kind of means spirit wrestlers.
00:29:20,00:29:22,It was the idea that people didn't believe
00:29:22,00:29:24,just in the word of the Bible.
00:29:24,00:29:26,They thought personal revelation was very important.
00:29:26,00:29:29,So they wrestled with what the Bible was telling them
00:29:29,00:29:31,and that set them up as their own thing.
00:29:31,00:29:33,They moved over to Canada.
00:29:33,00:29:34,And the people that we're talking about
00:29:34,00:29:37,"who largely were dealing with the Mounties,"
00:29:37,00:29:39,"dealing with protests and so on,"
00:29:39,00:29:41,they were kind of a splinter group of them.
00:29:41,00:29:43,They were called the Sons of Freedom.
00:29:43,00:29:45,And effectively what they liked to mix
00:29:45,00:29:47,was nudism and arson.
00:29:47,00:29:49,And this was in their own communities as well.
00:29:49,00:29:51,They thought materialism was too much
00:29:51,00:29:53,and that needed to be done by.
00:29:53,00:29:55,So I was reading this article about a guy
00:29:55,00:29:58,"called J.J. Virgin who said when he was a kid,"
00:29:58,00:30:01,he used to come home and there would be some naked old lady
00:30:01,00:30:03,trying to burn his house down.
00:30:03,00:30:05,And they'd have to go get out of here.
00:30:05,00:30:06,Like they were rats.
00:30:06,00:30:08,- I think he's the leader of the group now.
00:30:08,00:30:08,"- Yeah, exactly."
00:30:08,00:30:12,"- So his great, great, great, great, great grandfather"
00:30:12,00:30:15,"was Peter Virgin, who all of these people must have had,"
00:30:15,00:30:18,I'm not surprised they didn't want to go to school
00:30:18,00:30:19,because they would have had a--
00:30:19,00:30:20,- Because they were virgins.
00:30:20,00:30:21,"- They would have had a hard, hard time."
00:30:21,00:30:24,"Just, that's a tailor-made nickname."
00:30:24,00:30:27,"So Peter Virgin was, he was killed on a train"
00:30:27,00:30:28,in British Columbia.
00:30:28,00:30:29,He was blown up.
00:30:29,00:30:34,And his followers then set their houses on fire in protest
00:30:34,00:30:35,and then stood around them naked.
00:30:35,00:30:38,"This was part of, it was just part of the society."
00:30:38,00:30:40,- But they only burned their own stuff.
00:30:40,00:30:41,"And to be fair, we should say,"
00:30:41,00:30:43,"'cause they're still out there, the duke of balls."
00:30:43,00:30:45,"The vast majority, not nudists,"
00:30:45,00:30:47,"very embarrassed by this weird nudist sect,"
00:30:47,00:30:48,"like an embarrassing uncle,"
00:30:48,00:30:50,"getting naked, setting fire to stuff."
00:30:50,00:30:51,"- The vast majority were just,"
00:30:51,00:30:54,"their motto was, ""Toyle and a peaceful life."""
00:30:54,00:30:58,"What a depressing way to live, but you know."
00:30:58,00:30:59,- It's not depressing though.
00:30:59,00:31:02,"Peter Virgin, he founded a town called Brilliant."
00:31:02,00:31:03,"- Yes, I love it."
00:31:03,00:31:04,- Yeah.
00:31:04,00:31:05,- Such a good PR.
00:31:05,00:31:06,"'Cause everything you build there can be called,"
00:31:06,00:31:08,"oh, the Brilliant Cafe."
00:31:08,00:31:10,"- Absolutely, there's a Brilliant Bridge,"
00:31:10,00:31:12,"a Brilliant Power Station,"
00:31:12,00:31:14,"a Brilliant Jam Factory, and a Brilliant Cemetery."
00:31:14,00:31:18,"- Actually, to be fair, I think the Brilliant Jam Factory"
00:31:18,00:31:19,was one of the things that was burned down.
00:31:19,00:31:21,"- It was, yeah, it's not there anymore."
00:31:21,00:31:25,- But Tolstoy was the one who facilitated their emigration.
00:31:25,00:31:26,"They're persecuted in Russia,"
00:31:26,00:31:29,because they refuse to do anything the czar says.
00:31:29,00:31:31,"And Tolstoy's like, ""Hey, I love people"
00:31:31,00:31:33,"""who deny themselves all the fun stuff in life."""
00:31:33,00:31:34,You know.
00:31:34,00:31:36,- Like people who read my novels.
00:31:36,00:31:36,(laughing)
00:31:36,00:31:37,- Exactly.
00:31:37,00:31:40,"And so he raised the money,"
00:31:40,00:31:43,"actually out of the proceeds of resurrection,"
00:31:43,00:31:46,"his third, less well-read novel."
00:31:46,00:31:48,He paid for them to get to Canada.
00:31:48,00:31:49,"- Yeah, yeah, cool."
00:31:49,00:31:51,- And they put up a statue to them in return.
00:31:51,00:31:51,- Yes.
00:31:51,00:31:56,"- Nude protest has been a thing for centuries,"
00:31:56,00:31:58,as the Dukubos kind of show.
00:31:58,00:31:59,But there are recent examples too.
00:31:59,00:32:03,"So in 2020, French dentists launched a nude protest"
00:32:03,00:32:07,to protest the lack of PPE in their sector.
00:32:07,00:32:08,- No. - They did.
00:32:08,00:32:13,They took a series of reasonably erotic shots of themselves.
00:32:13,00:32:14,- Open wide.
00:32:14,00:32:16,(laughing)
00:32:17,00:32:21,- You could have said spit.
00:32:21,00:32:22,"Yeah, okay, anyway."
00:32:22,00:32:23,(laughing)
00:32:23,00:32:25,"No, they took photos of themselves nude in their surgeries"
00:32:25,00:32:27,"to say, ""Look, we're being hung out to dry here."
00:32:27,00:32:28,"""We don't have any PPE."""
00:32:28,00:32:29,"So I think that's great. - Right, wow."
00:32:29,00:32:30,- German doctors did the same thing.
00:32:30,00:32:31,- Wow.
00:32:31,00:32:34,"- In 2022, a Somerset woman called Jill White"
00:32:34,00:32:38,did a fantastic nude protest on the A358 in Somerset.
00:32:38,00:32:39,"Right, she's in a wheelchair."
00:32:39,00:32:41,And the council had let the pavement
00:32:41,00:32:43,by the side of this road get completely overgrown.
00:32:43,00:32:45,She could not get along it in her wheelchair.
00:32:45,00:32:47,"I mean, to see the photos is ridiculous."
00:32:47,00:32:49,"No one could be a pedestrian on this road,"
00:32:49,00:32:50,and especially not if you're in a chair.
00:32:50,00:32:53,So she posed naked along the roadside
00:32:53,00:32:55,with protest signs aimed at the council
00:32:55,00:32:57,"saying, ""I've trimmed my bush."
00:32:57,00:32:58,"""Now highways trim yours."""
00:32:58,00:32:59,"- Oh, wow."
00:32:59,00:33:01,Yeah.
00:33:01,00:33:02,- Super.
00:33:02,00:33:03,- Awesome.
00:33:03,00:33:05,"- She'd been complaining for two years,"
00:33:05,00:33:06,getting no results.
00:33:06,00:33:07,"As soon as she started taking off her clothes,"
00:33:07,00:33:09,they acted and they trimmed it and they dealt with it.
00:33:09,00:33:10,- Wow.
00:33:10,00:33:12,- Really good.
00:33:12,00:33:14,"- In Christianity, it is often a thing, isn't it?"
00:33:14,00:33:15,Trying to be like Adam and Eve.
00:33:15,00:33:16,- Yeah.
00:33:16,00:33:19,"- And the nudist, I quite like, are the ranters."
00:33:19,00:33:21,"I didn't, have you heard of the ranters?"
00:33:21,00:33:23,- Are they like Ramblers or?
00:33:23,00:33:25,- Was it someone called Clarkson?
00:33:25,00:33:27,Was it a cadre of the ranters?
00:33:27,00:33:28,I think he actually was.
00:33:28,00:33:29,- I think it was.
00:33:29,00:33:30,"- Oh, genuinely."
00:33:30,00:33:31,- All right.
00:33:31,00:33:33,"- There was basically, this was during the English Civil War"
00:33:33,00:33:35,when lots of Quakers and Shakers and Weird Sex popped up
00:33:35,00:33:37,and the ranters are one of them.
00:33:37,00:33:38,And they were the best
00:33:38,00:33:40,"'cause they basically didn't really have any leader,"
00:33:40,00:33:41,didn't really have any beliefs
00:33:41,00:33:44,"except to eat good meat, drink loads of alcohol,"
00:33:44,00:33:49,"swear loads in pubs, embrace sex, and cause havoc."
00:33:49,00:33:50,And be naked.
00:33:50,00:33:51,- So it does sound like Clarkson would have been.
00:33:51,00:33:52,- It does sound like Clarkson would have been.
00:33:52,00:33:53,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:33:53,00:33:58,- This is the greatest religious grouping in the world.
00:33:58,00:33:59,- Yeah.
00:33:59,00:34:00,- Yeah.
00:34:00,00:34:02,- And then he gets naked and everyone leaves it.
00:34:02,00:34:05,(upbeat music)
00:34:05,00:34:11,- It is time for fact number four
00:34:11,00:34:13,and that is my fact.
00:34:13,00:34:17,My fact is that the world of statistical analysis
00:34:17,00:34:19,was changed forever
00:34:19,00:34:23,because of a woman called Dr. Myriel Bristol
00:34:23,00:34:25,who is most famous for being able to tell
00:34:25,00:34:30,whether a cup of tea was poured milk first or tea first.
00:34:30,00:34:34,- The controversial topic in the room apparently.
00:34:34,00:34:35,- Yeah.
00:34:35,00:34:37,- Do you all think you could tell?
00:34:37,00:34:39,- I think I could tell personally.
00:34:39,00:34:39,- Do you?
00:34:39,00:34:41,- I'm confident I could tell.
00:34:41,00:34:42,"- Wow, okay."
00:34:42,00:34:43,- I'm certain.
00:34:43,00:34:45,- I am as well actually and which do you prefer?
00:34:45,00:34:48,"- Oh, well, I mean, tea and first."
00:34:48,00:34:49,- Yeah.
00:34:49,00:34:50,- Because--
00:34:50,00:34:52,- Let's hear it for milk and first.
00:34:52,00:34:55,"- Okay, can I just call nonsense"
00:34:55,00:34:57,"on that milk and first crowd, right?"
00:34:57,00:34:58,- Right.
00:34:58,00:35:02,"- 96% of tea is made by people putting a bag in a mug,"
00:35:02,00:35:05,"single serving of tea, pouring hot water on the bag."
00:35:05,00:35:09,There's nobody alive in the world who puts a milk in a mug
00:35:09,00:35:10,and puts the bag in the milk.
00:35:10,00:35:13,"- I think though, 'cause this was in the 1920s,"
00:35:13,00:35:15,I think more people were doing it in those days.
00:35:15,00:35:16,- It was the time of--
00:35:16,00:35:17,- Tea pots.
00:35:17,00:35:18,- It was big teapots.
00:35:18,00:35:19,It was the golden age of the teapot.
00:35:19,00:35:21,- But how did statistics change then?
00:35:21,00:35:23,"- Oh, okay, well, this is amazing."
00:35:23,00:35:28,"So Muriel Bristol was a phycologist, not a psychologist."
00:35:28,00:35:32,There's a very distinct difference.
00:35:32,00:35:36,"You don't wanna be telling your woes to a moss expert,"
00:35:36,00:35:37,an algae expert.
00:35:37,00:35:38,- Don't you?
00:35:38,00:35:40,(laughing)
00:35:40,00:35:42,- So one day she was in a common room
00:35:42,00:35:46,where a lot of scientists were at Romestead
00:35:46,00:35:48,and there was a guy there called Ronald Fisher.
00:35:48,00:35:51,He offers her a cup of tea and he's making her the tea
00:35:51,00:35:55,and she declines it because she prefers it
00:35:55,00:35:57,when the milk was poured into the cup before the tea.
00:35:57,00:36:01,So she's one of the people who are in the minority here
00:36:01,00:36:03,"and he was like, ""Well, don't be ridiculous."
00:36:03,00:36:04,"""You can't taste that."""
00:36:04,00:36:06,"And she said, ""Well, absolutely I can taste that."""
00:36:06,00:36:09,"And so the story goes is that eight cups of tea were made,"
00:36:09,00:36:11,four with milk poured in first
00:36:11,00:36:14,and then four with the milk in afterwards.
00:36:14,00:36:17,And he developed a hypothesis basically
00:36:17,00:36:20,on how this is applicable to statistics generally
00:36:20,00:36:23,and it has become quite a bedrock of statistics as a result.
00:36:23,00:36:27,"- Yeah, so we should say Fisher was not that..."
00:36:27,00:36:29,I don't think he gave a shit about milk in first
00:36:29,00:36:30,"and tea in first, to be very honest."
00:36:30,00:36:31,"- No, no, of course."
00:36:31,00:36:34,"- He didn't mind whether she knew,"
00:36:34,00:36:38,but it was about developing the kind of moment
00:36:38,00:36:40,at which you agree that if someone's claimed
00:36:40,00:36:43,"they can do something, that has been kind of proven."
00:36:43,00:36:47,"So he decided that after she said correctly eight times,"
00:36:47,00:36:50,"whether the milk was in first or the tea was in first,"
00:36:50,00:36:54,there's a one in 70 chance that she'd get that correct.
00:36:54,00:36:56,That's probably about right.
00:36:56,00:36:57,- It's sort of the...
00:36:57,00:36:59,This was the birth of the randomized controlled trial.
00:36:59,00:37:00,- Yeah.
00:37:00,00:37:02,- Which is the gold standard of all scientific trials today.
00:37:02,00:37:04,"The tea cups are presented, yeah."
00:37:04,00:37:07,The tea cups were presented in a random order.
00:37:07,00:37:09,"She would, I think the odds of her knowing,"
00:37:09,00:37:10,did you say it?
00:37:10,00:37:11,"It was one in 70. - Yeah, one in 70."
00:37:11,00:37:13,"- Yeah, just there was no way."
00:37:13,00:37:16,"Well, there was a 1.4% chance of her getting it exactly right."
00:37:16,00:37:18,- And these statistical tests are still used
00:37:18,00:37:22,"if you've got something where you're only doing a few tests,"
00:37:22,00:37:24,you can't do it a billion times
00:37:24,00:37:26,and see whether she gets it right a billion times.
00:37:26,00:37:27,You only do it eight or nine times
00:37:27,00:37:28,and you see what the chances are.
00:37:28,00:37:31,"- Yeah, so there's a popular science writer"
00:37:31,00:37:33,called Karl Zimmer and he wrote in his article
00:37:33,00:37:36,"""Why We Can't Rule Out Bigfoot""."
00:37:36,00:37:37,He said...
00:37:37,00:37:38,- Incredible.
00:37:38,00:37:40,- He said that this method has become an important tool
00:37:40,00:37:42,for scientific discovery.
00:37:42,00:37:44,You find the test in every branch of science
00:37:44,00:37:47,from psychology to virology to cosmology
00:37:47,00:37:50,and scientists have followed it using his threshold method.
00:37:50,00:37:51,So it's hugely important.
00:37:51,00:37:53,- Although his threshold was incorrect
00:37:53,00:37:55,"to what statisticians do today, I think,"
00:37:55,00:37:57,"which is long actually, he didn't need"
00:37:57,00:37:58,to make eight cups of tea.
00:37:58,00:38:00,I think he could have only made six
00:38:00,00:38:03,'cause I think mostly if you show that something
00:38:03,00:38:06,"only has a 5% chance of happening in statistics,"
00:38:06,00:38:08,"then you've decided that's fine, that's legit,"
00:38:08,00:38:10,"that this, therefore, is a real thing."
00:38:10,00:38:14,"So two useless cups of tea that wasted, I think."
00:38:14,00:38:15,But I think what's quite nice about this
00:38:15,00:38:18,"is that if you've studied statistics ever,"
00:38:18,00:38:20,Lady Tasting Tea is like the bedrock.
00:38:20,00:38:22,It's the most famous thing.
00:38:22,00:38:25,But who knows that it's this random algae expert
00:38:25,00:38:28,"and most sweetly, the reason it happened was, I think,"
00:38:28,00:38:29,'cause of a bit of flirting
00:38:29,00:38:32,"because basically she was with this, you know,"
00:38:32,00:38:34,"very big deal mathematician, Ronald Fisher,"
00:38:34,00:38:35,and she claimed this about the milk and tea.
00:38:35,00:38:38,"But the person who said, I bet you don't know"
00:38:38,00:38:41,"where the milk's gone in first or tea's gone in first,"
00:38:41,00:38:44,"was another guy in the room, a biochemist called William Roach."
00:38:44,00:38:46,"And he was like, go on, let's test her."
00:38:46,00:38:48,Let's see if she does know.
00:38:48,00:38:50,And William Roach went on to marry her.
00:38:50,00:38:52,And if that's not some kind of like saddle
00:38:52,00:38:56,"across the lab flirting, go on, let's test her."
00:38:56,00:38:57,- It's very sweet.
00:38:57,00:39:00,- Do you wanna hear a bit more of lab flirting from history?
00:39:00,00:39:01,- Yeah.
00:39:01,00:39:05,- So is anyone here familiar with the Bristol stool chart?
00:39:05,00:39:06,"- Oh, yeah."
00:39:06,00:39:10,"- Yeah, it's a big deal over here."
00:39:10,00:39:13,You're all checking your poos every day
00:39:13,00:39:17,and checking whether they're sausage-shaped but lumpy
00:39:17,00:39:20,or soft blobs with a clear-cut edge.
00:39:20,00:39:22,"- James, I think you promised flirting"
00:39:22,00:39:25,and I'm not currently seeing any.
00:39:25,00:39:28,- This was invented by a guy called Dr. Ken Heaton.
00:39:28,00:39:31,"And when he was at university,"
00:39:31,00:39:34,he was asked by one of his lecturers
00:39:34,00:39:37,to examine the ankle of a fellow student
00:39:37,00:39:39,who was called Susan O'Connor.
00:39:39,00:39:42,And the ankle examination went so well
00:39:42,00:39:43,that they got married.
00:39:43,00:39:46,"- Wow, that is very good."
00:39:46,00:39:47,- Did he fall in love with the ankles?
00:39:47,00:39:48,Do we know?
00:39:48,00:39:49,"- Yeah, and worked his way up."
00:39:49,00:39:50,- Yeah. - Maybe.
00:39:52,00:39:55,"- She was very cool, Muriel Bristol."
00:39:55,00:39:57,"She worked at this place, Dan described,"
00:39:57,00:39:58,Rothamsted Experimental Station.
00:39:58,00:39:59,- Yeah.
00:39:59,00:40:00,"- And one of the things they had,"
00:40:00,00:40:04,"they had soil that was collected in 1846, right?"
00:40:04,00:40:06,"And at the time, she was studying the same soil,"
00:40:06,00:40:08,the same sample in 1919.
00:40:08,00:40:12,And she found that if you feed it little solution
00:40:12,00:40:15,"of minerals, then life appears."
00:40:15,00:40:17,I tried to find out interesting people
00:40:17,00:40:22,who would span the dates 1846 to 1919
00:40:22,00:40:24,very few really interesting people.
00:40:24,00:40:25,- Okay.
00:40:25,00:40:26,- Who have you got?
00:40:26,00:40:28,"- Well, 1919 JD Salinger was born,"
00:40:28,00:40:29,catcher in the rye.
00:40:29,00:40:30,He's pretty cool.
00:40:30,00:40:31,"You know, I like him."
00:40:31,00:40:33,"- He was drinking his own urine by the end,"
00:40:33,00:40:35,which was really interesting.
00:40:35,00:40:37,"- Wow, that's incredibly depressing."
00:40:37,00:40:40,Do you wanna hear the 1846?
00:40:40,00:40:41,- Sure.
00:40:41,00:40:43,- I'd really tried to find people who died in 1846
00:40:43,00:40:45,who were of interest to us.
00:40:45,00:40:48,Have you heard of John Ainsworth Horrocks?
00:40:48,00:40:51,"- Yeah, he was killed by his own camel or something, right?"
00:40:51,00:40:52,- Bingo.
00:40:52,00:40:53,"Well, I remembered."
00:40:53,00:40:54,Yeah.
00:40:54,00:40:54,- What's he?
00:40:54,00:40:55,- He was one of the early Europeans
00:40:55,00:40:57,to go very deep into Australia
00:40:57,00:40:59,and he was shot by his own camel.
00:40:59,00:41:00,- Really?
00:41:00,00:41:01,- Yeah.
00:41:01,00:41:02,- Okay.
00:41:02,00:41:03,- And how is he associated with this?
00:41:03,00:41:06,"- He died in 1846,"
00:41:06,00:41:08,which is the year that the soil sample was collected.
00:41:08,00:41:09,- Oh.
00:41:09,00:41:10,- Oh.
00:41:10,00:41:12,- That Muriel Bristol then studied in 1919.
00:41:12,00:41:14,- And did she collect it from Australia?
00:41:14,00:41:15,- No.
00:41:15,00:41:16,"No, no one."
00:41:16,00:41:17,No.
00:41:17,00:41:19,"- It's serious, isn't it?"
00:41:19,00:41:20,- Thanks.
00:41:20,00:41:21,"- I was looking at other,"
00:41:21,00:41:24,cool statistical stuff that's named after randomers
00:41:24,00:41:26,"who don't know anything about the statistics,"
00:41:26,00:41:27,which she didn't.
00:41:27,00:41:28,She knew about algae.
00:41:28,00:41:30,And do you guys know about the Will Rogers paradox?
00:41:30,00:41:33,- The comedian in America.
00:41:33,00:41:34,- Of course you know who Will Rogers is.
00:41:34,00:41:37,The vaudeville 1930s comedian.
00:41:37,00:41:39,Does anyone else know who Will Rogers is?
00:41:39,00:41:40,"Brilliant, Anne."
00:41:40,00:41:43,"You are so, so good and so niche."
00:41:43,00:41:45,- Can you imagine the only person in the room
00:41:45,00:41:47,who knew him is sat right next to you.
00:41:47,00:41:48,(laughing)
00:41:48,00:41:50,- So he had a joke
00:41:50,00:41:52,which had them rolling in the arse in the 30s
00:41:52,00:41:55,at a time when during the Great Depression
00:41:55,00:41:58,and a lot of people from Oklahoma had left
00:41:58,00:41:59,and moved to California
00:41:59,00:41:59,'cause they were very poor.
00:41:59,00:42:01,They wanted to make a life elsewhere.
00:42:01,00:42:02,And they were called Okeys.
00:42:02,00:42:04,"And he had a joke which went,"
00:42:04,00:42:07,"""Hey, when the Okeys left Oklahoma and moved to California,"
00:42:07,00:42:11,"""they raised the average intelligence level in both states."""
00:42:11,00:42:13,Yeah.
00:42:13,00:42:14,"Still, it still gets a few of them going."
00:42:14,00:42:15,- Yeah.
00:42:15,00:42:16,"- So that's basically saying,"
00:42:16,00:42:18,"""Hey, these guys are so thick"
00:42:18,00:42:19,"""that once they leave Oklahoma,"
00:42:19,00:42:20,"""Oklahoma gets smarter."""
00:42:20,00:42:22,But Californians are so thick
00:42:22,00:42:23,"that once they enter California,"
00:42:23,00:42:25,they'll make California smarter.
00:42:25,00:42:27,"The weird thing about this is, right,"
00:42:27,00:42:29,"you've made, that is statistically possible,"
00:42:29,00:42:30,if that were true.
00:42:30,00:42:33,You've made the average intelligence of both places higher.
00:42:33,00:42:35,"But of course, you've only involved the same people."
00:42:35,00:42:38,So you haven't made the overall average intelligence higher.
00:42:38,00:42:41,How is this possible?
00:42:41,00:42:43,And it is possible 'cause it's all about weighted averages
00:42:43,00:42:45,and we don't need to go into that.
00:42:45,00:42:47,(laughing)
00:42:47,00:42:48,I think that's a really cool paradox.
00:42:48,00:42:52,I'm made up by a comedian who made a silly joke in the 30s
00:42:52,00:42:54,who didn't know that his name would be placed
00:42:54,00:42:55,in mathematical history.
00:42:55,00:42:56,"- Yeah, very cool."
00:42:56,00:42:57,- A good match. - Very cool.
00:42:57,00:42:59,- I heard two of you saying...
00:42:59,00:43:01,"- Oh, I know if milk's been poured into the tea"
00:43:01,00:43:02,beforehand or not.
00:43:02,00:43:03,(audience laughing)
00:43:03,00:43:05,"- Well, we've got four cups of tea here."
00:43:05,00:43:06,"- Oh, piss off."
00:43:06,00:43:08,(audience laughing)
00:43:08,00:43:11,"- It's James Lee, everyone, our tour manager."
00:43:11,00:43:13,(audience applauding)
00:43:13,00:43:14,- Here we go.
00:43:14,00:43:17,Two have had milk poured in to begin with
00:43:17,00:43:19,and two have had them in afterwards.
00:43:19,00:43:22,"Now, have a taste test and let's see if you can..."
00:43:22,00:43:23,- This is for me and Anna.
00:43:23,00:43:24,- Yeah. - Okay.
00:43:24,00:43:25,- That one's tea first.
00:43:25,00:43:26,- Okay.
00:43:26,00:43:27,- Milk first.
00:43:27,00:43:29,"- Oh, God, it's so sweet."
00:43:29,00:43:31,"- This is captivating, God, yeah."
00:43:31,00:43:34,(audience laughing)
00:43:34,00:43:36,- These are both tea first.
00:43:36,00:43:37,- You have two tea first.
00:43:37,00:43:38,"- Yeah, I definitely."
00:43:38,00:43:40,"- Okay, Andy, what are you gonna say then?"
00:43:40,00:43:42,- I think one of mine is milk first.
00:43:42,00:43:43,- Okay. - It's a lot milkier.
00:43:43,00:43:45,I'll tell you that much.
00:43:45,00:43:45,- Yeah.
00:43:45,00:43:47,"- So one of you has to be wrong, right?"
00:43:47,00:43:48,"Because there's two and two of each,"
00:43:48,00:43:49,but you've picked two for yourself.
00:43:49,00:43:52,"So, James, which one?"
00:43:52,00:43:55,- Look at the wrong saucer! - Look at the wrong saucer!
00:43:55,00:43:58,- This is so exciting for us.
00:43:58,00:44:00,"Milk, M for milk first."
00:44:00,00:44:02,"Bullshit, you've put it on the wrong..."
00:44:02,00:44:04,"Put it on the wrong saucer, mate."
00:44:04,00:44:05,Another M.
00:44:05,00:44:07,- You've had two.
00:44:07,00:44:10,"- Both of us, neither of us got it right."
00:44:10,00:44:13,I got one right and one wrong.
00:44:13,00:44:15,- You're no Mario Bristol.
00:44:15,00:44:16,"- Oh, man."
00:44:16,00:44:18,"- Well, look."
00:44:18,00:44:21,That's it for our show tonight.
00:44:21,00:44:24,Thank you so much for everyone for being here.
00:44:24,00:44:25,"Bristol, that was awesome."
00:44:25,00:44:27,We'll see you again soon.
00:44:27,00:44:29,We'll be back again next week
00:44:29,00:44:30,for another episode.
00:44:30,00:44:31,Goodbye!
00:44:31,00:44:35,(audience cheering)
