00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,440
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:03,040
 - Hi everyone, welcome to this week's episode

3
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:04,440
 of No Such Things as a Fish.

4
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:08,200
 We are slap bang in the middle of our tour right now

5
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:12,640
 and that means that you yourself can come and see us live.

6
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:14,160
 - Yes, you can.

7
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:15,960
 We love doing the tours.

8
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:17,600
 We're having a great time this time around.

9
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:20,160
 We record a new podcast every time we do a show

10
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,400
 and we have lots of little nerdy,

11
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:25,200
 extra never before seen bits in between

12
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:29,160
 and we are going to be in Cardiff, in London Town

13
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:31,120
 and in Manchester very soon.

14
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:33,880
 So we are in Cardiff on the 16th of October,

15
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:35,640
 London on the 23rd and the 24th

16
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:37,920
 and Manchester on the 27th.

17
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:39,000
 - That is correct.

18
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,760
 And one of the places we will be very soon is Gothenburg.

19
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:46,160
 We will be in Gothenburg on the 27th of September.

20
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:47,600
 That's a week on Friday

21
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:50,400
 and we will be doing a live episode of the podcast there.

22
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:53,440
 So do come along, search for the Gothenburg Book Festival

23
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:55,680
 and you'll see all the details about that.

24
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,200
 - And of course you can get tickets to that

25
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:59,040
 and all the others by going to No Such Things

26
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:01,480
 as a Fish dot com slash live.

27
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:03,800
 - Okay, I don't know, I think it's time to sound check.

28
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:05,040
 We better get on with it.

29
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,720
 - Let's get on with the show.

30
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:07,960
 - On with the podcast.

31
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:12,280
 (beeping)

32
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:16,280
 (speaking in foreign language)

33
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:26,400
 - Hello and welcome to another episode

34
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,200
 of No Such Thing as a Fish,

35
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:32,400
 a weekly podcast this week coming to you live from Bristol.

36
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,140
 (crowd cheering)

37
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:38,200
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

38
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:40,440
 I am sitting here with Anna Tyshinski,

39
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:42,920
 Andrew Hunter Murray and James Harkin.

40
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:45,200
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones

41
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,880
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days.

42
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:50,840
 And in no particular order, here we go.

43
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:54,200
 Starting with fact number one, and that is Andy.

44
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:57,080
 - My fact is that the unauthorized release of beavers

45
00:01:57,080 --> 00:02:00,360
 into British waterways is known as beaver bombing.

46
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:02,520
 (crowd laughing)

47
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:03,360
 - That's exerting.

48
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,920
 - Yeah, this has been covered recently.

49
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,480
 They're all over the place now

50
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,920
 and they've been making their way back.

51
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:11,040
 So the river Otter is now full of beavers and--

52
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:11,880
 - Confusingly.

53
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:12,720
 - Very confusing.

54
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,520
 - Which pisses off the otters in the river Otter,

55
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,360
 as I suspect.

56
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,200
 - Are there otters in the river Otter?

57
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,440
 - There are otters in the river Otter.

58
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:20,160
 And I did read that someone was saying the Camel River

59
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,520
 is another good place to introduce them,

60
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,960
 which I imagine will piss off the camels

61
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,460
 in the Camel River.

62
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:26,120
 - And there are hundreds of them out there now.

63
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,320
 - Is that really in the UK?

64
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:28,560
 - In the UK, yeah, yeah.

65
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,960
 In researching this fact, I spoke to someone who said,

66
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,880
 very secretively, they were related to someone

67
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:35,520
 who knew a thing or two about reintroducing secret beavers.

68
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,360
 - Oh, really?

69
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:38,320
 - Yeah, sort of gorilla, confusingly.

70
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:39,920
 (crowd laughing)

71
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,600
 - The gorillas are furious.

72
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:44,200
 - Yeah, and so I've read an interview as well

73
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,000
 with a guy called Simon.

74
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
 Basically, it takes a lot of time and paperwork

75
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,320
 to release a beaver outside an enclosure.

76
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:52,320
 You need to do an impact assessment.

77
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:53,680
 Sometimes on the Isle of Wight,

78
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:57,280
 you have to do 100,000 words of impact assessment.

79
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,860
 100,000 words, that's a novel, that's a full novel.

80
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:02,320
 - Yeah, and people are objecting, aren't they?

81
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:04,080
 'Cause no one's got time to read that many words.

82
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,840
 - But why do we want beavers anyway?

83
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,480
 - Well, because they build dams, don't they?

84
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:09,760
 And it creates this lovely kind of ecosystem

85
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,120
 for lots of other things to exist.

86
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,520
 They're like engineers.

87
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:15,640
 So there are these people, and it's such an exciting world.

88
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:16,760
 If you want to get into crime,

89
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:18,480
 but feel like you're doing kind of a good thing,

90
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,000
 I think beaver bombing is the way.

91
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:20,840
 - Interesting.

92
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:23,600
 - There's a guy called Olivier Rubbers.

93
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:24,440
 Did you read about him?

94
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:25,440
 He was one of the originals.

95
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:28,200
 He was in 1998, he just heard someone mention

96
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:30,600
 the reintroduction of beavers and he decided,

97
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:33,200
 I'm gonna do that, borrowed his dad's car,

98
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,880
 and he drove to Germany.

99
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:37,080
 I think he lived in Belgium, drove to Germany,

100
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:39,160
 picked up some beavers, crossed the border,

101
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:41,380
 back into Belgium, dropped them in a river,

102
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:44,600
 went so well, he repeated it with 97 more beavers.

103
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:45,440
 (laughing)

104
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,280
 - Why?

105
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,720
 - He did 97 different journeys,

106
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:49,840
 or did he go, all right, lads, in the car?

107
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,280
 - Yeah, it's like that riddle.

108
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,040
 You're not allowed to take a beaver with another beaver,

109
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,280
 otherwise they eat each other.

110
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,400
 - Right, that's crazy.

111
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:58,360
 Hey, do you know, if you let a beaver into your lounge room,

112
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:00,760
 it will rearrange all your furniture.

113
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:01,600
 Isn't that amazing?

114
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:02,440
 - Oh, that's nice.

115
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:03,800
 - That's lovely, along Feng Shui principles.

116
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:06,960
 - No, this is a thing that was noticed by someone

117
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,920
 who wrote a lot about beavers back in the day.

118
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:11,680
 She was sort of a conservationist who wanted to raise

119
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:14,320
 the idea that they're intelligent animals

120
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,440
 that they're interesting to look at.

121
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:17,020
 She was called Dorothy Richards,

122
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:18,840
 and she was looking after beavers,

123
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:19,740
 and they came into her house,

124
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:21,520
 and as soon as they walked in, they were like,

125
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:22,760
 no, let's put the chair over there,

126
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:23,880
 let's get that over there.

127
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,160
 And apparently, according to her,

128
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:27,040
 they are the only animals apart from humans

129
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,760
 that radically transform their environment.

130
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:29,880
 So it's all about safety.

131
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:31,400
 They want the room perfect.

132
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:33,640
 So if you put a beaver in your room, it will be different.

133
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:35,520
 - And it will flood the room.

134
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:36,360
 - Yes.

135
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,200
 - Crucially.

136
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,280
 - What they do is they build the dams

137
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:41,360
 where they hear the water the most, right?

138
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,520
 'Cause they wanna find the narrow part of the river

139
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,860
 where the water's really flowing.

140
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:46,960
 So they listen out for loud water.

141
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,080
 When they find the loud water,

142
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,720
 that's where they build their dams.

143
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,120
 But if you get a tape recorder

144
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,600
 and put it in the middle of the room,

145
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,000
 and put a beaver in there,

146
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,760
 they'll go around finding any bits and pieces in the room

147
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:59,200
 and then just put it all on top of the tape recorder.

148
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:01,040
 - Yeah, that's cool. - That's very cool.

149
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,400
 So they make dams,

150
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,760
 and this can help to clean the water,

151
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:06,320
 can it, in rivers.

152
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,560
 The ones in the River Otter,

153
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:10,040
 they store 24 million liters of water,

154
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:13,360
 which is the equivalent of 10 Olympic-sized swimming pools.

155
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:16,280
 And they reckon it could help our bills, our water bills,

156
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:17,480
 because they clean it,

157
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:19,720
 that means the water companies don't have to.

158
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:20,800
 (audience laughing)

159
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,720
 'Cause I did find that between November 2019

160
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,160
 and February 2020,

161
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:28,560
 sewage treatment works near Stoke illegally release sewage

162
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:31,480
 equivalent to 10 Olympic-sized swimming pools.

163
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:33,080
 So basically all those beavers

164
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:34,560
 just did the right amount of work

165
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,200
 to help that one sewage leak.

166
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,040
 - That's great.

167
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:39,400
 So they're the sort of water company's friend?

168
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:40,480
 - Yeah. - That's nice.

169
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,840
 I don't like them as much now.

170
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,080
 (audience laughing)

171
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:45,240
 - Do you know what a beaver deceiver is?

172
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:47,400
 - Um, is that like catfishing?

173
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:48,240
 - Is it like a...

174
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,400
 (audience laughing)

175
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,320
 Oh yeah.

176
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,280
 - So it's someone who tricks a beaver in some way

177
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:55,160
 into building them a dam for their own use though.

178
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:59,080
 - Basically you've got an area where you want to have beavers,

179
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:01,160
 but you don't want the area to be flooded.

180
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:03,640
 And so you allow them to build their dam,

181
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:05,320
 but then you might put a little pipe in it

182
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:06,760
 so the water can still go through,

183
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:08,600
 but they can still do their dam.

184
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,080
 And that's called a beaver deceiver.

185
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,120
 It's just nice to say.

186
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:11,960
 - Yeah.

187
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:14,160
 Was there ever a dog that was a beaver retriever?

188
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,680
 (audience laughing)

189
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:17,520
 I don't know.

190
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:18,960
 (audience laughing)

191
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,560
 - Hey, I read a sentence about beavers

192
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,960
 and I wasn't able to find anything more out about it.

193
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,720
 So I'm just saying it in case you guys did,

194
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,920
 but it was such a mysterious sentence in a review

195
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,080
 about a book on beavers.

196
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:32,000
 It said, "Beavers never walked backwards."

197
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:32,840
 (audience laughing)

198
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:33,680
 - Okay.

199
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:36,080
 - Did you read the next sentence in the review?

200
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,320
 - They eat their food twice.

201
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:39,320
 (audience laughing)

202
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:40,400
 - They do do that.

203
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,480
 - They cannot doggy paddle.

204
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:45,680
 They have ever growing orange teeth

205
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,480
 with which to gnaw woody plants.

206
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:50,520
 - Is this book review 10 weird facts about beavers?

207
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:52,000
 (audience laughing)

208
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,600
 - No, it's an amazing book about the point being made

209
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:58,120
 that beavers, actually, they don't only make dams,

210
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:00,640
 but they made America, effectively.

211
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:04,240
 America's fortunes were effectively down to beavers.

212
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,440
 And it was fur trading.

213
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,480
 Beavers were virtually extinct over here, right?

214
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:09,640
 Because they'd been hunted down, we'd used all the fur.

215
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:11,240
 And then we found out that in North America,

216
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,600
 there were all these beavers there.

217
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:15,320
 So all the ships went over and started hunting them down.

218
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:18,880
 And then you ended up with billionaires of beaver fur.

219
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:19,960
 And it made America.

220
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:23,320
 - I read that it literally created Canada,

221
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:25,160
 beaver trade, basically.

222
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:27,920
 'Cause you had all the people on the East Coast,

223
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,840
 and they needed to find more and more beavers.

224
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,560
 And so they had to go inland and inland,

225
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:34,440
 and they set up all these kind of trading posts

226
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:36,280
 between all of the First Nations people.

227
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:39,120
 And all those trading posts that came because of beaver pelts

228
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,960
 was what became Canada in the end.

229
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,480
 - Yeah, it's very hard to underestimate

230
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,960
 how totally essential they were.

231
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:47,800
 But when New York was sold to the Dutch

232
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,000
 by the Native Americans,

233
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,240
 I read that actually it was mostly beaver pelts

234
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,080
 that were sold.

235
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,280
 And New York was like a little bonus.

236
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,920
 They were like, "We'll sell you 2,000 beaver pelts.

237
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,200
 And also we've got Manhattan as well.

238
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,200
 Do you want this one too?"

239
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,880
 And they were like, "Yeah, okay, toss it in."

240
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,040
 But yeah, crucial.

241
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:03,000
 And historically, it seems someone fair

242
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:03,960
 for such a crucial animal

243
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:06,040
 that the main thing they're famous for

244
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:08,000
 is taking off their testicles.

245
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,400
 If you Google beavers, and their name--

246
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,240
 - What?

247
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,960
 - If you Google beavers with your safe search off.

248
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:17,600
 You do get a lot of testicles that give you that.

249
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,440
 - You wouldn't think testicles were the first thing.

250
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,280
 - How did they take them off?

251
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,800
 - Well, I mean, they didn't take them off at all.

252
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,200
 But since ancient Greek, since Esop's fables,

253
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,680
 there was this idea that beaver testicles

254
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,480
 were very sought after, which they were,

255
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:32,080
 for their medicinal qualities, which didn't exist.

256
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:36,400
 And beavers figured out that if they tore off the testicles,

257
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:37,440
 threw them at the hunter,

258
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:40,120
 the hunter wouldn't chase after the beavers anymore.

259
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:43,080
 The reason this came about is because they hide their testicles

260
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:45,560
 behind this fleshy flap, the male beavers.

261
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:46,400
 - Lovely.

262
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:49,120
 - So, yes, I think fleshy flap is the term.

263
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,440
 And so, people were like, where are their testicles?

264
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:54,040
 They must have torn them off because of this reason.

265
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:56,080
 But it's where the name comes from.

266
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:59,480
 So castorium is the stuff they secrete.

267
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:02,520
 Their name is castor in the Latin name.

268
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:04,840
 And that's from castrated, same origin.

269
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,840
 'Cause the idea was they ripped off their testicles.

270
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:08,000
 - When I was kid in Bolton,

271
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,760
 we used to shout beaver in the streets.

272
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:12,520
 If we ever saw anyone with a beard, you did beavering.

273
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:13,960
 - This is so exciting.

274
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,920
 - Literally, we would walk down the road

275
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,600
 and there was someone with a beard

276
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:21,040
 and the first person to spot them would shout beaver.

277
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:21,880
 - Right.

278
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:23,600
 - I read that this was a game popular

279
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,680
 in the 1910s and 1920s.

280
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:28,280
 (audience laughing)

281
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:30,800
 - I believe that is the case in the rest of the country.

282
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,280
 (audience laughing)

283
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,840
 - What would beavering survive?

284
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:36,440
 - What would the beaver do, what would they say?

285
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:38,960
 - Well, they would be confused.

286
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,720
 They would be like, that game hasn't been popular

287
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:45,520
 since the 1920s and were there variations for you?

288
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:46,360
 - I can't remember.

289
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:48,000
 I was really young when it happened.

290
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,880
 It wasn't literally in the 1920s,

291
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,320
 but yeah, I was really young when it happened.

292
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:53,360
 - 'Cause supposedly there were things like

293
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,600
 if someone had a beard and a moustache,

294
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:59,120
 that was a royal beaver or there was a king beaver,

295
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,800
 which is a red, whiskered policeman

296
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,360
 riding a green bicycle.

297
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:04,000
 (audience laughing)

298
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,320
 And I just wondered if you knew the--

299
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,720
 - No, I didn't know the nose.

300
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:09,440
 But my theory is that the use of beaver

301
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:13,040
 for women's genitals is from that game.

302
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,520
 I'm pretty sure it is.

303
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:18,400
 Because the first citation of that is from 1927.

304
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:21,200
 And the citation in the Oxford English Dictionary says

305
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:24,240
 she took off her clothes from her head to her toes

306
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:27,240
 and the voice at the keyhole yelled beaver.

307
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,640
 - Right.

308
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,320
 - So it genuinely seems like that might be it.

309
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,280
 - Yeah.

310
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:33,600
 Well, I'll tell you what, Canada in 1920,

311
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,240
 that was the year that what is now

312
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:38,440
 their second oldest magazine ever was founded.

313
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:40,080
 It was called The Beaver.

314
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:43,640
 And it lasted all the way until 2010

315
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:45,480
 until it needed to change its name,

316
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:47,480
 which they've just changed to Canada's history.

317
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:50,360
 And it was largely because none of their emails

318
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:51,360
 were getting through to anyone

319
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,840
 because they were being filtered out by foreign filters.

320
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:54,680
 (audience laughing)

321
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:56,960
 So all of their emails, all their newsletters,

322
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,280
 nothing reaching it.

323
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:00,120
 People were confused anyway about it.

324
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:02,600
 - Same as Beaver College in Pennsylvania.

325
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:03,440
 - Really?

326
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,560
 - They changed their name because, again,

327
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,440
 that no one could get to their website.

328
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:09,080
 - Plus the applicants they got were questionable,

329
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,120
 to say the least.

330
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:11,160
 (laughing)

331
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:12,440
 - So there wasn't an attempt before now

332
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:14,120
 to reintroduce beavers to the UK

333
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:16,600
 'cause I think there were some hundreds of thousands

334
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,360
 in the Middle Ages.

335
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:21,760
 Europe had about between 60 and 400 million beavers.

336
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,360
 So I think that's a sign that no one really knows

337
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,480
 how many there were.

338
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:27,000
 But there were attempts to reintroduce them

339
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,160
 'cause they clung on a few,

340
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:32,120
 and like really far Eastern sort of like central Asian step

341
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:33,560
 that there were a few beavers knocking around.

342
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:34,400
 - Right.

343
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,560
 - And in the 1860s, there wasn't an attempt

344
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,800
 to re-beaver in Suffolk and--

345
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,480
 - Is that the technical term?

346
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,320
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

347
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:42,160
 - To re-beaver.

348
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,840
 - Re-beaver, yeah, yeah.

349
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:45,760
 But they were de-beavered, they were destroyed.

350
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,280
 (laughing)

351
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:48,920
 And the very final ones, I just like this,

352
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:51,560
 were sent to London to be stuffed by Lady Gooch.

353
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:53,320
 (laughing)

354
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:55,280
 - That sounds like another euphemism, doesn't it?

355
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:57,400
 - How was that not your headline fact?

356
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:58,840
 (laughing)

357
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:01,400
 Beavers used to be stuffed by Lady Gooch.

358
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:03,980
 (upbeat music)

359
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:06,560
 (upbeat music)

360
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:11,980
 - It is time for fact number two, and that is Anna.

361
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:14,260
 - My fact this week is that in the 1600s,

362
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:17,820
 the Spanish ambassador to England had a specially made chair

363
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:21,540
 with a hole in the bottom to accommodate his anal fistula.

364
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:22,580
 (laughing)

365
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:23,780
 - Wow, hmm.

366
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:27,460
 - Yeah, this is such a good article that I read.

367
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:29,860
 It was on history today, and it was about a play

368
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:32,420
 called A Game at Chess, which is the most popular play

369
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:33,820
 of the 1600s.

370
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:35,220
 Most of you won't remember it.

371
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:36,060
 The main--

372
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:37,260
 - Still big in Bolton.

373
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:39,260
 (laughing)

374
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:42,940
 - The main villain in it is a guy called Diego Sarmiento

375
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:47,020
 de Acuña, or Count Gondemar, who was the Spanish ambassador

376
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:50,500
 to England between 1613 and 1622,

377
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:54,980
 and he had an anal fistula that was very famous.

378
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:56,460
 And I just think if you've got an anal fistula,

379
00:12:56,460 --> 00:12:57,500
 you don't want it to be famous.

380
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:59,380
 It impacted his movement, and--

381
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:02,420
 - It's hard to say how famous it was, isn't it?

382
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:05,180
 - Right, literally everyone in the country knew about it.

383
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:08,020
 - Their posters on their bedroom wall, it was--

384
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:09,980
 - But how many people can even name

385
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:11,540
 the Spanish ambassador now?

386
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:14,060
 It's a job that has undergone a huge decline in prestige

387
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:15,100
 in the last 400 years.

388
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:15,940
 - Right.

389
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:17,460
 - Yeah, it's since we weren't at war with Spain anymore.

390
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:18,300
 - Exactly.

391
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:19,140
 - Yeah.

392
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:20,620
 - Exactly, but I just think that's really tragic.

393
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:21,460
 I looked up the current--

394
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:22,780
 - We're not at war with Spain anymore?

395
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:23,620
 (laughing)

396
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:25,580
 - I'm willing to say, "Wow, come and have a go."

397
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:27,300
 (laughing)

398
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:30,940
 Well, no, I just think it's as in,

399
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:32,820
 I looked up the Spanish ambassador to the UK earlier.

400
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:34,220
 I've forgotten his name.

401
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:35,220
 - Right, yeah.

402
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:37,060
 - It's definitely Spanish, but I just mean--

403
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:37,900
 - Yeah, yeah.

404
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:38,740
 - I think it's a shame for him.

405
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:40,460
 And when you say an anal fistula,

406
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:43,020
 I actually would like a quick sense check on what that is,

407
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:44,460
 because I like the way you said in your fact,

408
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:46,820
 his chair had a hole in the bottom,

409
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:47,700
 because as far as I can tell,

410
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:49,780
 that is what one of those is, right?

411
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:51,100
 (laughing)

412
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:52,740
 But it's a sort of extra hole in the bottom.

413
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:53,740
 - Yeah, it's one too many.

414
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:54,580
 - Right.

415
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:55,400
 - Right.

416
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:57,300
 - A fistula is a hole basically between two tubes.

417
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:58,140
 - Yeah.

418
00:13:58,140 --> 00:13:58,980
 - It's a gap where there shouldn't be a gap.

419
00:13:58,980 --> 00:13:59,820
 - Yeah.

420
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:01,180
 - The hole in the bottom of the chair

421
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:02,980
 was not 'cause he had something hanging out

422
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:04,420
 that had to drop through it,

423
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:05,940
 which is kind of what you assume, I think,

424
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:07,340
 when you hear me say that.

425
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:10,260
 It's because it would be so sensitive and painful.

426
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:11,660
 And he also had to be carried through the streets

427
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:12,820
 of London on a sedan chair,

428
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:14,140
 'cause everyone hated him so much

429
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:16,140
 that they would attack him if he was carried,

430
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:16,980
 you know, if he walked.

431
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:17,820
 - Really?

432
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:18,660
 - Plus it was quite hard to walk with a fistula.

433
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:21,180
 - Well, like kick him in the bum kind of thing, as a--

434
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:22,900
 - I think that would probably be one of the tactics, yeah.

435
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:23,740
 - Yeah.

436
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:25,060
 - Surely something to make you less likable

437
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:26,940
 is having yourself carried through the streets of London

438
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:28,260
 in a sedan chair.

439
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:31,820
 - Surely just wear a hat and go out and just...

440
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:34,220
 - When you say it doesn't, a secret...

441
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:35,060
 - No.

442
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:35,900
 - Well, it does.

443
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:37,860
 I mean, it does, and it is an unpleasant condition.

444
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:41,020
 - But not feces, it doesn't act as a second bum hole.

445
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:41,860
 It acts as a second bum hole.

446
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:42,700
 - Yeah, yeah, of course.

447
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:45,340
 Because basically it's caused by some sort of infection.

448
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:46,740
 Sorry for the gory details,

449
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:49,260
 but it's important to know if you have one.

450
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:52,100
 An infection somewhere in the anal tract,

451
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:53,780
 and there's a bunch of pus builds up,

452
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:55,460
 and then when it goes away, it leaves a little tunnel

453
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:58,220
 that goes from the anal tract out of the sort of button.

454
00:14:58,220 --> 00:14:59,180
 Right near the bum hole,

455
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:01,900
 and so it will leak things from your bow.

456
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:04,500
 - Most of my stuff is about Spanish foreign policy.

457
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:05,340
 - Right.

458
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:06,900
 (audience laughing)

459
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:08,780
 - Do you guys remember when my wife, Fenella,

460
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:11,380
 thought that my oldest son, Will, had a second bum hole?

461
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:12,620
 (audience laughing)

462
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:13,540
 - No.

463
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:16,060
 It was in the first few weeks after he had been born.

464
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:17,180
 It was our first child,

465
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:19,740
 and you have to change the nappy every few hours, right?

466
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:21,500
 So you're getting up at like two a.m., four a.m.

467
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:23,220
 I got up at like two or four,

468
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:24,340
 and I was going to change the nappy,

469
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:25,380
 and Fenella said to me,

470
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:27,140
 "Don't forget to wipe a second bum."

471
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:28,740
 And I said, "Excuse me?"

472
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:31,940
 And she said, "His second bum hole, don't forget so,

473
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:34,460
 "because it could get infected if you don't wipe it properly."

474
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:36,020
 And I said, "What do you mean?"

475
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:37,660
 And basically newborn babies,

476
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:39,700
 they have a little dent that's right at the top,

477
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:42,460
 but she thought that that was an actual other bum hole.

478
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:45,020
 This is how tired and sleep deprived she was.

479
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:47,020
 - What did she think was going to happen to this

480
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:47,940
 in the fullness of time?

481
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:49,380
 Does she think there are people walking

482
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:50,580
 among us who have this?

483
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:52,140
 - I said to her, I was like,

484
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:53,500
 "How did you think that was possible?"

485
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:55,260
 And she was like, "I don't know how boys work.

486
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:56,500
 "I don't know what you have."

487
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:58,100
 (audience laughing)

488
00:15:58,100 --> 00:15:58,940
 - That's fair.

489
00:15:58,940 --> 00:15:59,940
 - Yeah, yeah.

490
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:02,860
 - So the Spanish in the 1600s,

491
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:05,140
 (audience laughing)

492
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:06,980
 they had been at war with Britain,

493
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:08,780
 or with England, I should say.

494
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:12,380
 And this guy, Gondama, who was the ambassador,

495
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:14,300
 he'd come to the English court

496
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:17,220
 and he'd become really best friends with King James.

497
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:18,740
 They were super close.

498
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:20,020
 And because they were so close,

499
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:23,860
 he started making James do lots of policies

500
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:25,700
 that were very pro-Spanish.

501
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:27,980
 And it eventually came to the extent

502
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:31,540
 where he forced James to execute Walter Raleigh,

503
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:33,820
 because so Walter Raleigh had been a pirate

504
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:36,260
 and attacking some Spanish ships.

505
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:37,620
 And he said, "Well, we're gonna go to war

506
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:39,140
 "unless you execute him."

507
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:41,220
 James first said, "Okay, fine, you're my best mate.

508
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:42,340
 "I will do it."

509
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:43,940
 And then obviously, everyone hated him

510
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:44,780
 from that moment.

511
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:45,740
 - It's just incredible.

512
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:47,900
 - Yeah, the Spanish ambassador has the power

513
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:48,940
 to ask the king.

514
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:50,860
 - Well, we don't know that he did.

515
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:53,220
 - Imagine if King Charles executed Alan Titchmarsh

516
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:57,620
 on the orders of whoever the Spanish ambassador is now.

517
00:16:57,620 --> 00:16:59,540
 I was just trying to think of a beloved national figure,

518
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:00,940
 like a national figurehead.

519
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:03,900
 - Alan Titchmarsh isn't attacking Spanish possessions.

520
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:06,220
 At most, he's buying up some Spanish plants.

521
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:08,740
 - Okay, it's a bad example.

522
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:10,020
 - Did you guys read the account

523
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:11,740
 of the execution of Walter Raleigh?

524
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:12,580
 - No.

525
00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:13,820
 - That's sort of alluded to.

526
00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:14,860
 He was incredibly popular.

527
00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:17,260
 He was like the fanciable, you know,

528
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:19,100
 Clive Owen or whatever of his day.

529
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:22,740
 And PR-wise, he nailed the execution.

530
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:25,180
 So it was pretty dodgy grounds

531
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:27,820
 on which he was sentenced to death for treason.

532
00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:28,820
 The morning of his execution,

533
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:30,140
 he had this huge breakfast.

534
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:31,380
 He was puffing on his pipe.

535
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:32,340
 He had a glass of wine.

536
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:34,020
 He made a joke about it.

537
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:36,140
 He went up to the scaffold and he said,

538
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:38,180
 "Sorry, do you mind if I just say a few words

539
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:39,180
 "at the scaffold?"

540
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:41,980
 He made a 25-minute speech.

541
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:44,900
 Full of sort of charm and laughs and warmth.

542
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:47,420
 At one point, he sensed that the nobles on the balcony

543
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:48,540
 couldn't hear him properly.

544
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:50,900
 And so he invited them all onto the scaffold with him

545
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:52,620
 and started the speech again.

546
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:54,780
 So that they could hear it properly.

547
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:56,580
 And he shook all of their hands, saying,

548
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:58,860
 "Hello, how are you, how's your wife?"

549
00:17:58,860 --> 00:17:59,700
 All of that.

550
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:00,940
 At one point, the sheriff said,

551
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:02,780
 "Do you want to come and warm yourself by the fire

552
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:04,420
 "while you give this speech?"

553
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:06,860
 And he said, "No, I'm getting a bit sick,

554
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:09,460
 "so I want to get this over with before I get ill again."

555
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:12,740
 And then he apologized to his executioner

556
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:14,420
 for going on so long.

557
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:16,500
 And then popped his head under the ax and went.

558
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:17,820
 - Really? - Which, you know,

559
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:19,060
 if you're going to go and style.

560
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:20,300
 - It does feel like he was leading up

561
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:21,740
 to something incredibly clever.

562
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:23,220
 - That's the shame of it.

563
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:25,620
 - You know, one person who, I was trying to,

564
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:27,860
 I was really hoping there was a Wikipedia article

565
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:30,300
 which was notable people with anal fistulas.

566
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:32,140
 And it wasn't, it wasn't there.

567
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:34,100
 It's kind of the thing Wiki sometimes has.

568
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:36,300
 But one person, if the page did exist,

569
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:38,540
 that would belong on there, is Charles Dickens.

570
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:39,380
 - Oh.

571
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:40,740
 - Dickens had a fistula.

572
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:41,580
 - Interesting.

573
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:44,220
 - Yeah, and he had it very early on in his career.

574
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:46,620
 And there's an argument that had it not

575
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:49,220
 had been sorted out by a pioneering doctor at the time,

576
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:51,540
 who was called Frederick Salmon,

577
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:54,020
 then we might not have had all the subsequent books

578
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:56,860
 that he wrote because he was so debilitated by it.

579
00:18:56,860 --> 00:18:59,300
 He used to have to dictate to his then wife

580
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:00,540
 and she would write down.

581
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:02,180
 But he couldn't, he just couldn't think properly

582
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:03,300
 with all that going on.

583
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:04,860
 So this guy, Frederick Salmon,

584
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:06,940
 because it was a dangerous operation back in the day.

585
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:07,940
 This guy was amazing.

586
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:09,820
 He set up his hospital, which was called

587
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:11,620
 the Infirmary for Relief of the Poor,

588
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:15,580
 afflicted with fistulas and the diseases of the rectum.

589
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:16,620
 It was called that until someone said,

590
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:17,940
 why don't we just call it St. Mark's?

591
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:19,140
 They changed it to that.

592
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:20,060
 (audience laughing)

593
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:23,300
 And he carried out over 3,500 operations,

594
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:24,540
 one of which was Dickens.

595
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:25,900
 And as a result, he was fixed.

596
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:28,380
 And then he went on to being able to sit down

597
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:29,220
 and write his book.

598
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:30,060
 - That's great.

599
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:31,420
 - And Dickens, in those days, no NHS.

600
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:33,060
 So he had to pay for his operation.

601
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:34,340
 And he paid for his operation

602
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:37,300
 with several autographed copies of the Pickwick papers.

603
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:39,340
 - Hmm, they've not accepted

604
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:42,620
 impossible things as payment at my private doctors.

605
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:45,460
 - The most famous surgeon of fistulas

606
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:48,580
 in the 18th century was Martin Van Butchel.

607
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:49,420
 He was--

608
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:52,340
 - That's very, very disconcerting for the patients.

609
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:54,380
 - Well, he would put loads of adverts on.

610
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:56,060
 He had amazing advertising.

611
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:57,940
 He was most famous 'cause he enjoyed riding

612
00:19:57,940 --> 00:20:00,100
 around Hyde Park on a white pony,

613
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:02,380
 which he often painted purple.

614
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:03,220
 - Oh.

615
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:04,060
 (audience laughing)

616
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:05,340
 - And he had a really long beard

617
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:08,420
 and he always carried a large white bone around with him.

618
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:09,260
 - Bone?

619
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:10,100
 - Bone.

620
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:11,820
 You know, like Fred Flintstone might.

621
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:13,220
 - Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

622
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:14,820
 - And his wife died.

623
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:16,500
 She was killed by the Nazis, actually.

624
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:19,140
 Well, she died in 1775.

625
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:19,980
 - Yeah.

626
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:22,300
 - And Butchel asked his friend, John Hunter,

627
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:24,020
 to preserve the body.

628
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:25,940
 And then he put the body on display

629
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:29,380
 as kind of advertising for his fistula company.

630
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:33,300
 - Lot of questionable decisions being made in this.

631
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:35,180
 - The body was described soon afterwards

632
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:37,340
 as a repulsive looking object.

633
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:38,820
 And eventually he had to get rid of it

634
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:40,540
 when his second wife objected.

635
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:43,080
 - Oh, that is fussy.

636
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:45,020
 (audience laughing)

637
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:47,420
 - His wife's preserved corpse was on display

638
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:50,600
 in the college in Lincoln's Infields

639
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:54,180
 until 1941 when it was bombed by the Nazis.

640
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:55,020
 - Ah.

641
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:56,460
 - It was not the target.

642
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:57,460
 (audience laughing)

643
00:20:57,460 --> 00:20:58,980
 - It's too creepy.

644
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:00,320
 Get rid of it.

645
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:02,380
 - This play, by the way, is so fascinating

646
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:03,940
 because it was 1600s.

647
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:05,500
 This was performed at the Globe.

648
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:08,440
 Like this was the original Shakespearean theater.

649
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:11,420
 And the play itself, the plot is amazing.

650
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:13,100
 It was literally as if you were watching

651
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:14,820
 a live game of chess, right?

652
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:16,120
 - Yeah, and the play, this is the play

653
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:17,540
 that took the piss out of Condomard.

654
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:18,580
 - Yes, exactly.

655
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:20,420
 And so when the play started,

656
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:23,140
 people very quickly realized that this was a satire

657
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:24,700
 of the ambassador.

658
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:26,620
 And so they had to get word to the king

659
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:27,780
 in order to ban it.

660
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:30,260
 And they specifically put this play on at a point

661
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:31,420
 when the king went away.

662
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:33,660
 So it took about nine days to get to him.

663
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:35,500
 So multiple performances were happening.

664
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:36,980
 They couldn't stop it from happening.

665
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:38,820
 So it was such a hit job

666
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:40,340
 and it was done in Shakespeare's Globe.

667
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:41,860
 - And it was massively popular.

668
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:42,700
 It's mad.

669
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:44,260
 - Everyone got the allegory.

670
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:46,300
 A seventh of the population of London

671
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:47,880
 saw it in nine days.

672
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,980
 The chess piece, which I think was the Black Knight

673
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:51,700
 who represented Condomard,

674
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:54,420
 was referred to as the fistula of Europe

675
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:55,680
 during the play.

676
00:21:55,680 --> 00:22:00,260
 And 50 years later, in the 1660s or 1670s,

677
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:02,740
 people were still referring to the fistula of Europe

678
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:04,540
 and everyone knew what they meant.

679
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:05,380
 - Right.

680
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:06,220
 - Imagine that.

681
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:07,040
 - Did he see it?

682
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:07,880
 Was he there?

683
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:08,720
 - I don't think he was.

684
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:11,100
 I think he had retired as ambassador by that point.

685
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:13,220
 It was his successor as ambassador,

686
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:15,740
 who was a guy called Coloma who complained about it.

687
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:17,580
 The play has a lot of scatological humor

688
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:20,460
 and it has a lot of rude, wind-based puns.

689
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:22,540
 And I was reading an article analyzing the play

690
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:25,340
 in a book called "Theatre in Post-Reformation London."

691
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:27,020
 And I just want to read you this sentence,

692
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:28,860
 which I just really liked,

693
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:31,260
 to adapt Anton, oh, so by the way,

694
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:32,800
 they bring on his fake seat.

695
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:34,260
 They bring on the fistula seat,

696
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:35,780
 which looks exactly like a loose seat.

697
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:36,620
 That's the thing.

698
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:37,580
 Here's the line.

699
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:39,780
 To adapt Anton Chekhov's maxim

700
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:43,020
 that when a gun is introduced into a play, it must be fired.

701
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:46,540
 I propose that when a toilet is brought on stage,

702
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:48,100
 there must be farts.

703
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:49,900
 (audience laughing)

704
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:50,740
 - Lovely.

705
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:51,580
 - Who would've thought?

706
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:52,780
 He sounds very sinister, Condomar.

707
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:54,060
 He does, I mean, in all, you know,

708
00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:55,820
 it would like titch my stuff aside.

709
00:22:55,820 --> 00:22:58,500
 I think he does sound, he tried to intimidate people.

710
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:00,620
 He had himself painted as Machiavelli.

711
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:02,500
 - But apparently Machiavellian wasn't a word

712
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:03,740
 that was used to describe someone

713
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:05,280
 who was Machiavellian until him.

714
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:06,600
 So that got applied to him.

715
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:08,100
 And then everyone was like, that's a great term.

716
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:10,340
 - We use that for other things now.

717
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:11,980
 So he's done good things as well, right?

718
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:14,220
 - He married his niece.

719
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:16,140
 He's done great things, as one tried to say.

720
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:18,720
 He married his niece and then his cousin.

721
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,020
 He definitely had a type.

722
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:22,640
 (audience laughing)

723
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,040
 - Yeah, that's terrible.

724
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:26,460
 - No, that's not that close.

725
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:27,300
 - His niece?

726
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:29,020
 - His niece is pretty close, I know.

727
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:31,240
 - It was the 1500s, if you do 1600s,

728
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:34,100
 if you didn't marry a niece, you're a weirdo.

729
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:35,900
 - How is your uncle, by the way?

730
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:37,340
 (audience laughing)

731
00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:40,060
 - My four-legged child is doing very well as well.

732
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:40,900
 Thank you.

733
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:41,740
 (audience laughing)

734
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:42,900
 - Bubbles from here to breakfast.

735
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:45,140
 (audience laughing)

736
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:47,720
 (upbeat music)

737
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:55,140
 - It is time for fact number three, and that is James.

738
00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:59,100
 - Okay, my fact this week is that in 1930s Canada,

739
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:02,220
 the Mounties dealt with illegal nudists

740
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:05,180
 by covering them in itching powder.

741
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:08,820
 That is a very, how did they get close enough to apply,

742
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:11,260
 as in the Mounties or on horseback, I think of them as?

743
00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:13,700
 - That's the Mountie part of them, the Mounted.

744
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:15,820
 - Did they just scatter it?

745
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:17,620
 - Yeah, I think they threw it.

746
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:22,620
 This was the Dukobas who were a group of 7,500 Russians

747
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:26,060
 who arrived in Canada 'cause they'd been persecuted

748
00:24:26,060 --> 00:24:29,420
 in Russia, and there was a small group of them

749
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:31,900
 who insisted on going naked all the time,

750
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:33,940
 kind of for their religion.

751
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:35,620
 They kind of thought it was getting closer

752
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:37,620
 to Adam and Eve and all that kind of stuff,

753
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:40,800
 and going naked was also a way to protest,

754
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:42,780
 so they didn't really want their children

755
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:45,580
 to go to the state schools, but they were forced to do so,

756
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:47,140
 and so they went naked.

757
00:24:47,140 --> 00:24:49,820
 - Obviously, the obvious protest against not wanting

758
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:51,820
 your children to go to the state school,

759
00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:53,860
 they wanted to keep in their communal living,

760
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:56,260
 they didn't want to be forced into state housing,

761
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:59,940
 so they went naked, and even if their own leaders

762
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:02,220
 did things that they didn't really like, they went naked.

763
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:06,260
 And the Canadian government decided this is not a good idea,

764
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:09,940
 so not only did they do this thing with the itching powder,

765
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:12,860
 but eventually, just due to what was happening here,

766
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:17,060
 the Canadian parliament outlawed public nudity in 1932

767
00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:19,100
 as a result of the Dukobas.

768
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:19,940
 - Yeah, right.

769
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:24,060
 - Itching powder is more of a schoolboy 1940s prank thing

770
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:26,620
 than a kind of legally imposed thing.

771
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:28,020
 Do we know what the itching powder was?

772
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:29,420
 Was it the old rose hips?

773
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:31,340
 - Yeah, I don't know which one it was.

774
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:32,820
 I suspect it was rose hips,

775
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:34,940
 just thinking about where they are.

776
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:36,780
 - 'Cause it's not that bad a punishment, is it?

777
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:38,020
 Especially if you're naked.

778
00:25:38,020 --> 00:25:39,580
 I think the worst is when it gets in your clothes.

779
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:40,940
 - Well, you're just trying to deter people, right?

780
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:42,900
 Like, we've spoken about this on the podcast before,

781
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:46,740
 where it was used by Churchill's brain box

782
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:47,580
 where they were coming.

783
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:49,940
 You know, all these amazing ideas they were coming up with

784
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:51,900
 that would subtly get to the Nazis,

785
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:53,660
 they were putting it in their clothes,

786
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:55,300
 they were putting it in their condoms,

787
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:56,340
 they were just itching powder.

788
00:25:56,340 --> 00:25:57,980
 - These were things that were tried in the Second World War.

789
00:25:57,980 --> 00:25:58,820
 - Yeah, exactly.

790
00:25:58,820 --> 00:26:01,020
 Like, it's just, it's a deterrent, isn't it?

791
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:02,100
 And...

792
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:03,700
 - That's why we won the war.

793
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:05,860
 Itching powder in the condoms.

794
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:07,780
 - The condom thing is quite clever, isn't it?

795
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:09,900
 Because you put your itching powder in the condoms

796
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:11,660
 and they get itchy down below

797
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:13,700
 and they think, well, I must have lice

798
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:16,740
 or I must have an STD or something like that.

799
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:19,260
 And quite often, if a lot of people in a platoon

800
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:20,100
 got an STD,

801
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:22,380
 then they were all kind of taken away from the front.

802
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:23,220
 - Really?

803
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:26,220
 - So I did read, I was on the website powderbolksolids.com,

804
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:28,300
 which is a great guide to historical powders.

805
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:31,740
 And they mentioned especially the itching powder

806
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:35,580
 was smuggled into Germany

807
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:39,540
 and particularly into the uniforms of the German army.

808
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:41,980
 So, particularly the Navy as well.

809
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:44,020
 So there was at least one U-boat

810
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:46,340
 had to turn around and come home

811
00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:49,460
 because everyone on board was just itching so much.

812
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:51,660
 - And again, they just assumed it was fleas.

813
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:52,500
 - Yeah, of course.

814
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:54,300
 - So you're in a submarine, you're itching so much,

815
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:55,980
 you think we must have a flea outbreak here,

816
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:57,740
 we're gonna have to go back to land,

817
00:26:57,740 --> 00:27:00,340
 clean all our clothes, but actually it was itching powder.

818
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:02,740
 - Oh, there was itching powder for trains as well

819
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:03,780
 in the Second World War.

820
00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:04,860
 That was the thing you could do.

821
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:05,700
 - So what would you do?

822
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:07,660
 - It was a special powder called carburandum.

823
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:08,660
 It was incredibly fine.

824
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:10,500
 And if you mix it with lubricating oil,

825
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:12,980
 it basically gums up an entire engine.

826
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:14,500
 It's a really, really effective way

827
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:17,980
 of just jamming a machine to a stop, effectively.

828
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:18,940
 - Is that itching?

829
00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:20,860
 How is that itching?

830
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:23,500
 - Well, it's, you know, I imagine the trains,

831
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:25,500
 I imagine the train would feel pretty itchy after that.

832
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:27,380
 - That's the train equivalent of itching.

833
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:28,940
 - It's the train equivalent of itching, that's so fascinating.

834
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:29,780
 - Yeah, all right.

835
00:27:29,780 --> 00:27:32,140
 But that was done in 1944 in June.

836
00:27:32,140 --> 00:27:35,140
 Two teenage French sisters applied a load

837
00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:37,340
 of carburandum powder to a train

838
00:27:37,340 --> 00:27:40,140
 that gummed up the tank supply to Normandy.

839
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:40,980
 - Wow.

840
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:42,900
 - So it's quite, that was an incredibly effective maneuver

841
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:43,900
 at that time, yeah, yeah.

842
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:46,740
 - It was also important in the Second World War

843
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:48,260
 because of where it comes from.

844
00:27:48,260 --> 00:27:50,620
 So rose hips are the standard itching powder, right?

845
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:52,220
 When I was a kid, it was always like, you know,

846
00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:54,820
 you should spread the seeds on someone from a rose hip

847
00:27:54,820 --> 00:27:56,380
 and it'll be very, very itchy.

848
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:57,860
 That's what most itching powder is made out of.

849
00:27:57,860 --> 00:27:59,060
 Did you guys used to do that?

850
00:27:59,060 --> 00:27:59,900
 - I never did.

851
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:00,740
 - No.

852
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:02,500
 - Oh, Andy, you had it done to you.

853
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:05,820
 (audience laughs)

854
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:08,660
 And you thought you had fleas, all of your teenagers.

855
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:10,740
 - Oh, the drugs on them, 'cause I also had fleas.

856
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:12,220
 (audience laughs)

857
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:15,100
 - But they're also an incredibly good source of vitamin C.

858
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:17,300
 So I love, they're one of the few things you can eat

859
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:19,100
 and we're just coming up to rose hip season.

860
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:19,940
 It's in winter.

861
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:21,180
 How many berries can you eat in winter?

862
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:23,780
 And you squeeze the, you know, the red juice out

863
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:24,700
 and it's delicious.

864
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:27,420
 But it has 20 times more vitamin C than oranges.

865
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:30,500
 And in World War II, oranges in short supply

866
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:32,300
 because we couldn't import many things.

867
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:35,460
 And so the government ran this huge rose hip collection

868
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:38,020
 campaign and they organized whole days

869
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:40,900
 when they sent out Boy Scouts and school children

870
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:43,740
 and WI people to go and collect rose hips

871
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:45,900
 and turn it into syrup.

872
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:49,180
 And I think they collected 134 million hips.

873
00:28:49,180 --> 00:28:50,460
 - Wow, that's great.

874
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:51,820
 - Not around here though, I don't think,

875
00:28:51,820 --> 00:28:53,700
 'cause they had ribena, right?

876
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:56,420
 'Cause wasn't ribena invented in Bristol?

877
00:28:56,420 --> 00:28:57,260
 Yeah.

878
00:28:57,260 --> 00:29:00,060
 And I think they, it was invented here for World War II

879
00:29:00,060 --> 00:29:02,220
 because there weren't many oranges,

880
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:03,620
 just as a vitamin C thing.

881
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:06,220
 And I think they gave it free to kids.

882
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:07,060
 - Wow, did they?

883
00:29:07,060 --> 00:29:07,900
 - Ribena, yeah.

884
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:08,740
 - That's great.

885
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:09,620
 - Wow, that's awesome.

886
00:29:09,620 --> 00:29:12,580
 The Duk Horvos of Canada.

887
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:16,580
 So those who left Russia and they set up this,

888
00:29:16,580 --> 00:29:18,620
 this basically thing, that word is basically,

889
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:20,940
 it kind of means spirit wrestlers.

890
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:22,940
 It was the idea that people didn't believe

891
00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:24,180
 just in the word of the Bible.

892
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:26,540
 They thought personal revelation was very important.

893
00:29:26,540 --> 00:29:29,260
 So they wrestled with what the Bible was telling them

894
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:31,580
 and that set them up as their own thing.

895
00:29:31,580 --> 00:29:33,140
 They moved over to Canada.

896
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:34,820
 And the people that we're talking about

897
00:29:34,820 --> 00:29:37,260
 who largely were dealing with the Mounties,

898
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:39,260
 dealing with protests and so on,

899
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:41,180
 they were kind of a splinter group of them.

900
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:43,340
 They were called the Sons of Freedom.

901
00:29:43,340 --> 00:29:45,180
 And effectively what they liked to mix

902
00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:47,300
 was nudism and arson.

903
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:49,860
 And this was in their own communities as well.

904
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:51,740
 They thought materialism was too much

905
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:53,220
 and that needed to be done by.

906
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:55,140
 So I was reading this article about a guy

907
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:58,020
 called J.J. Virgin who said when he was a kid,

908
00:29:58,020 --> 00:30:01,460
 he used to come home and there would be some naked old lady

909
00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:03,300
 trying to burn his house down.

910
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:05,260
 And they'd have to go get out of here.

911
00:30:05,260 --> 00:30:06,660
 Like they were rats.

912
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:08,140
 - I think he's the leader of the group now.

913
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:08,980
 - Yeah, exactly.

914
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:12,100
 - So his great, great, great, great, great grandfather

915
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:15,580
 was Peter Virgin, who all of these people must have had,

916
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:18,180
 I'm not surprised they didn't want to go to school

917
00:30:18,180 --> 00:30:19,340
 because they would have had a--

918
00:30:19,340 --> 00:30:20,180
 - Because they were virgins.

919
00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:21,780
 - They would have had a hard, hard time.

920
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:24,100
 Just, that's a tailor-made nickname.

921
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:27,340
 So Peter Virgin was, he was killed on a train

922
00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:28,260
 in British Columbia.

923
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:29,100
 He was blown up.

924
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:34,420
 And his followers then set their houses on fire in protest

925
00:30:34,420 --> 00:30:35,700
 and then stood around them naked.

926
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:38,460
 This was part of, it was just part of the society.

927
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:40,140
 - But they only burned their own stuff.

928
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:41,500
 And to be fair, we should say,

929
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:43,500
 'cause they're still out there, the duke of balls.

930
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:45,140
 The vast majority, not nudists,

931
00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:47,260
 very embarrassed by this weird nudist sect,

932
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:48,820
 like an embarrassing uncle,

933
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:50,060
 getting naked, setting fire to stuff.

934
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:51,580
 - The vast majority were just,

935
00:30:51,580 --> 00:30:54,860
 their motto was, "Toyle and a peaceful life."

936
00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:58,580
 What a depressing way to live, but you know.

937
00:30:58,580 --> 00:30:59,540
 - It's not depressing though.

938
00:30:59,540 --> 00:31:02,500
 Peter Virgin, he founded a town called Brilliant.

939
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:03,740
 - Yes, I love it.

940
00:31:03,740 --> 00:31:04,580
 - Yeah.

941
00:31:04,580 --> 00:31:05,420
 - Such a good PR.

942
00:31:05,420 --> 00:31:06,820
 'Cause everything you build there can be called,

943
00:31:06,820 --> 00:31:08,660
 oh, the Brilliant Cafe.

944
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:10,660
 - Absolutely, there's a Brilliant Bridge,

945
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:12,020
 a Brilliant Power Station,

946
00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:14,820
 a Brilliant Jam Factory, and a Brilliant Cemetery.

947
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:18,460
 - Actually, to be fair, I think the Brilliant Jam Factory

948
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:19,820
 was one of the things that was burned down.

949
00:31:19,820 --> 00:31:21,380
 - It was, yeah, it's not there anymore.

950
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:25,420
 - But Tolstoy was the one who facilitated their emigration.

951
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:26,860
 They're persecuted in Russia,

952
00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:29,780
 because they refuse to do anything the czar says.

953
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:31,620
 And Tolstoy's like, "Hey, I love people

954
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:33,820
 "who deny themselves all the fun stuff in life."

955
00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:34,660
 You know.

956
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:36,100
 - Like people who read my novels.

957
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:36,940
 (laughing)

958
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:37,780
 - Exactly.

959
00:31:37,780 --> 00:31:40,700
 And so he raised the money,

960
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:43,100
 actually out of the proceeds of resurrection,

961
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:46,180
 his third, less well-read novel.

962
00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:48,060
 He paid for them to get to Canada.

963
00:31:48,060 --> 00:31:49,340
 - Yeah, yeah, cool.

964
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:51,020
 - And they put up a statue to them in return.

965
00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:51,860
 - Yes.

966
00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:56,180
 - Nude protest has been a thing for centuries,

967
00:31:56,180 --> 00:31:58,180
 as the Dukubos kind of show.

968
00:31:58,180 --> 00:31:59,300
 But there are recent examples too.

969
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:03,900
 So in 2020, French dentists launched a nude protest

970
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:07,260
 to protest the lack of PPE in their sector.

971
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:08,300
 - No. - They did.

972
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:13,220
 They took a series of reasonably erotic shots of themselves.

973
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:14,540
 - Open wide.

974
00:32:14,540 --> 00:32:16,780
 (laughing)

975
00:32:17,620 --> 00:32:21,420
 - You could have said spit.

976
00:32:21,420 --> 00:32:22,740
 Yeah, okay, anyway.

977
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:23,580
 (laughing)

978
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:25,820
 No, they took photos of themselves nude in their surgeries

979
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:27,260
 to say, "Look, we're being hung out to dry here.

980
00:32:27,260 --> 00:32:28,380
 "We don't have any PPE."

981
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:29,220
 So I think that's great. - Right, wow.

982
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:30,700
 - German doctors did the same thing.

983
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:31,540
 - Wow.

984
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:34,100
 - In 2022, a Somerset woman called Jill White

985
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:38,260
 did a fantastic nude protest on the A358 in Somerset.

986
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:39,180
 Right, she's in a wheelchair.

987
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:41,660
 And the council had let the pavement

988
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:43,580
 by the side of this road get completely overgrown.

989
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:45,340
 She could not get along it in her wheelchair.

990
00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:47,460
 I mean, to see the photos is ridiculous.

991
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:49,220
 No one could be a pedestrian on this road,

992
00:32:49,220 --> 00:32:50,900
 and especially not if you're in a chair.

993
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:53,380
 So she posed naked along the roadside

994
00:32:53,380 --> 00:32:55,780
 with protest signs aimed at the council

995
00:32:55,780 --> 00:32:57,260
 saying, "I've trimmed my bush.

996
00:32:57,260 --> 00:32:58,740
 "Now highways trim yours."

997
00:32:58,740 --> 00:32:59,980
 - Oh, wow.

998
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:01,300
 Yeah.

999
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:02,860
 - Super.

1000
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:03,860
 - Awesome.

1001
00:33:03,860 --> 00:33:05,460
 - She'd been complaining for two years,

1002
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:06,300
 getting no results.

1003
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:07,940
 As soon as she started taking off her clothes,

1004
00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:09,860
 they acted and they trimmed it and they dealt with it.

1005
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:10,700
 - Wow.

1006
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:12,180
 - Really good.

1007
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:14,060
 - In Christianity, it is often a thing, isn't it?

1008
00:33:14,060 --> 00:33:15,460
 Trying to be like Adam and Eve.

1009
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:16,300
 - Yeah.

1010
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:19,060
 - And the nudist, I quite like, are the ranters.

1011
00:33:19,060 --> 00:33:21,300
 I didn't, have you heard of the ranters?

1012
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:23,140
 - Are they like Ramblers or?

1013
00:33:23,140 --> 00:33:25,420
 - Was it someone called Clarkson?

1014
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:27,740
 Was it a cadre of the ranters?

1015
00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:28,900
 I think he actually was.

1016
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:29,740
 - I think it was.

1017
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:30,580
 - Oh, genuinely.

1018
00:33:30,580 --> 00:33:31,420
 - All right.

1019
00:33:31,420 --> 00:33:33,020
 - There was basically, this was during the English Civil War

1020
00:33:33,020 --> 00:33:35,780
 when lots of Quakers and Shakers and Weird Sex popped up

1021
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:37,180
 and the ranters are one of them.

1022
00:33:37,180 --> 00:33:38,020
 And they were the best

1023
00:33:38,020 --> 00:33:40,500
 'cause they basically didn't really have any leader,

1024
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:41,740
 didn't really have any beliefs

1025
00:33:41,740 --> 00:33:44,740
 except to eat good meat, drink loads of alcohol,

1026
00:33:44,740 --> 00:33:49,100
 swear loads in pubs, embrace sex, and cause havoc.

1027
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:50,100
 And be naked.

1028
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:51,780
 - So it does sound like Clarkson would have been.

1029
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:52,620
 - It does sound like Clarkson would have been.

1030
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:53,940
 - Yeah, yeah.

1031
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:58,460
 - This is the greatest religious grouping in the world.

1032
00:33:58,460 --> 00:33:59,300
 - Yeah.

1033
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:00,140
 - Yeah.

1034
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:02,540
 - And then he gets naked and everyone leaves it.

1035
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:05,120
 (upbeat music)

1036
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:11,340
 - It is time for fact number four

1037
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:13,220
 and that is my fact.

1038
00:34:13,220 --> 00:34:17,740
 My fact is that the world of statistical analysis

1039
00:34:17,740 --> 00:34:19,300
 was changed forever

1040
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:23,260
 because of a woman called Dr. Myriel Bristol

1041
00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:25,660
 who is most famous for being able to tell

1042
00:34:25,660 --> 00:34:30,660
 whether a cup of tea was poured milk first or tea first.

1043
00:34:30,660 --> 00:34:34,020
 - The controversial topic in the room apparently.

1044
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:35,140
 - Yeah.

1045
00:34:35,140 --> 00:34:37,460
 - Do you all think you could tell?

1046
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:39,140
 - I think I could tell personally.

1047
00:34:39,140 --> 00:34:39,960
 - Do you?

1048
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:41,840
 - I'm confident I could tell.

1049
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:42,920
 - Wow, okay.

1050
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:43,760
 - I'm certain.

1051
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:45,820
 - I am as well actually and which do you prefer?

1052
00:34:45,820 --> 00:34:48,660
 - Oh, well, I mean, tea and first.

1053
00:34:48,660 --> 00:34:49,580
 - Yeah.

1054
00:34:49,580 --> 00:34:50,500
 - Because--

1055
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:52,260
 - Let's hear it for milk and first.

1056
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:55,740
 - Okay, can I just call nonsense

1057
00:34:55,740 --> 00:34:57,580
 on that milk and first crowd, right?

1058
00:34:57,580 --> 00:34:58,420
 - Right.

1059
00:34:58,420 --> 00:35:02,340
 - 96% of tea is made by people putting a bag in a mug,

1060
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:05,020
 single serving of tea, pouring hot water on the bag.

1061
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:09,580
 There's nobody alive in the world who puts a milk in a mug

1062
00:35:09,580 --> 00:35:10,840
 and puts the bag in the milk.

1063
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:13,720
 - I think though, 'cause this was in the 1920s,

1064
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:15,720
 I think more people were doing it in those days.

1065
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:16,560
 - It was the time of--

1066
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:17,400
 - Tea pots.

1067
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:18,220
 - It was big teapots.

1068
00:35:18,220 --> 00:35:19,280
 It was the golden age of the teapot.

1069
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:21,680
 - But how did statistics change then?

1070
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:23,720
 - Oh, okay, well, this is amazing.

1071
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:28,720
 So Muriel Bristol was a phycologist, not a psychologist.

1072
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:32,240
 There's a very distinct difference.

1073
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:36,040
 You don't wanna be telling your woes to a moss expert,

1074
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:37,120
 an algae expert.

1075
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:38,200
 - Don't you?

1076
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:40,300
 (laughing)

1077
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:42,860
 - So one day she was in a common room

1078
00:35:42,860 --> 00:35:46,060
 where a lot of scientists were at Romestead

1079
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:48,140
 and there was a guy there called Ronald Fisher.

1080
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:51,900
 He offers her a cup of tea and he's making her the tea

1081
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:55,020
 and she declines it because she prefers it

1082
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:57,140
 when the milk was poured into the cup before the tea.

1083
00:35:57,140 --> 00:36:01,340
 So she's one of the people who are in the minority here

1084
00:36:01,340 --> 00:36:03,260
 and he was like, "Well, don't be ridiculous.

1085
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:04,140
 "You can't taste that."

1086
00:36:04,140 --> 00:36:06,460
 And she said, "Well, absolutely I can taste that."

1087
00:36:06,460 --> 00:36:09,700
 And so the story goes is that eight cups of tea were made,

1088
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:11,480
 four with milk poured in first

1089
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:14,120
 and then four with the milk in afterwards.

1090
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:17,200
 And he developed a hypothesis basically

1091
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:20,560
 on how this is applicable to statistics generally

1092
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:23,920
 and it has become quite a bedrock of statistics as a result.

1093
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:27,320
 - Yeah, so we should say Fisher was not that...

1094
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:29,180
 I don't think he gave a shit about milk in first

1095
00:36:29,180 --> 00:36:30,800
 and tea in first, to be very honest.

1096
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:31,640
 - No, no, of course.

1097
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:34,320
 - He didn't mind whether she knew,

1098
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:38,500
 but it was about developing the kind of moment

1099
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:40,860
 at which you agree that if someone's claimed

1100
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:43,900
 they can do something, that has been kind of proven.

1101
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:47,980
 So he decided that after she said correctly eight times,

1102
00:36:47,980 --> 00:36:50,460
 whether the milk was in first or the tea was in first,

1103
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:54,300
 there's a one in 70 chance that she'd get that correct.

1104
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:56,180
 That's probably about right.

1105
00:36:56,180 --> 00:36:57,020
 - It's sort of the...

1106
00:36:57,020 --> 00:36:59,380
 This was the birth of the randomized controlled trial.

1107
00:36:59,380 --> 00:37:00,220
 - Yeah.

1108
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:02,620
 - Which is the gold standard of all scientific trials today.

1109
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:04,500
 The tea cups are presented, yeah.

1110
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:07,840
 The tea cups were presented in a random order.

1111
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:09,680
 She would, I think the odds of her knowing,

1112
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:10,520
 did you say it?

1113
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:11,640
 It was one in 70. - Yeah, one in 70.

1114
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:13,320
 - Yeah, just there was no way.

1115
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:16,680
 Well, there was a 1.4% chance of her getting it exactly right.

1116
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:18,800
 - And these statistical tests are still used

1117
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:22,320
 if you've got something where you're only doing a few tests,

1118
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:24,120
 you can't do it a billion times

1119
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:26,040
 and see whether she gets it right a billion times.

1120
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:27,680
 You only do it eight or nine times

1121
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:28,960
 and you see what the chances are.

1122
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:31,200
 - Yeah, so there's a popular science writer

1123
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:33,740
 called Karl Zimmer and he wrote in his article

1124
00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:36,500
 "Why We Can't Rule Out Bigfoot".

1125
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:37,560
 He said...

1126
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:38,500
 - Incredible.

1127
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:40,900
 - He said that this method has become an important tool

1128
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:42,180
 for scientific discovery.

1129
00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:44,300
 You find the test in every branch of science

1130
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:47,020
 from psychology to virology to cosmology

1131
00:37:47,020 --> 00:37:50,080
 and scientists have followed it using his threshold method.

1132
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:51,480
 So it's hugely important.

1133
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:53,700
 - Although his threshold was incorrect

1134
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:55,860
 to what statisticians do today, I think,

1135
00:37:55,860 --> 00:37:57,580
 which is long actually, he didn't need

1136
00:37:57,580 --> 00:37:58,980
 to make eight cups of tea.

1137
00:37:58,980 --> 00:38:00,940
 I think he could have only made six

1138
00:38:00,940 --> 00:38:03,360
 'cause I think mostly if you show that something

1139
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:06,300
 only has a 5% chance of happening in statistics,

1140
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:08,560
 then you've decided that's fine, that's legit,

1141
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:10,900
 that this, therefore, is a real thing.

1142
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:14,460
 So two useless cups of tea that wasted, I think.

1143
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:15,920
 But I think what's quite nice about this

1144
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:18,160
 is that if you've studied statistics ever,

1145
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:20,380
 Lady Tasting Tea is like the bedrock.

1146
00:38:20,380 --> 00:38:22,000
 It's the most famous thing.

1147
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:25,040
 But who knows that it's this random algae expert

1148
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:28,080
 and most sweetly, the reason it happened was, I think,

1149
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:29,440
 'cause of a bit of flirting

1150
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:32,120
 because basically she was with this, you know,

1151
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:34,080
 very big deal mathematician, Ronald Fisher,

1152
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:35,720
 and she claimed this about the milk and tea.

1153
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:38,960
 But the person who said, I bet you don't know

1154
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:41,140
 where the milk's gone in first or tea's gone in first,

1155
00:38:41,140 --> 00:38:44,700
 was another guy in the room, a biochemist called William Roach.

1156
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:46,840
 And he was like, go on, let's test her.

1157
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:48,380
 Let's see if she does know.

1158
00:38:48,380 --> 00:38:50,300
 And William Roach went on to marry her.

1159
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:52,800
 And if that's not some kind of like saddle

1160
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:56,720
 across the lab flirting, go on, let's test her.

1161
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:57,560
 - It's very sweet.

1162
00:38:57,560 --> 00:39:00,680
 - Do you wanna hear a bit more of lab flirting from history?

1163
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:01,520
 - Yeah.

1164
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:05,320
 - So is anyone here familiar with the Bristol stool chart?

1165
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:06,160
 - Oh, yeah.

1166
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:10,880
 - Yeah, it's a big deal over here.

1167
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:13,560
 You're all checking your poos every day

1168
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:17,600
 and checking whether they're sausage-shaped but lumpy

1169
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:20,640
 or soft blobs with a clear-cut edge.

1170
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:22,520
 - James, I think you promised flirting

1171
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:25,440
 and I'm not currently seeing any.

1172
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:28,520
 - This was invented by a guy called Dr. Ken Heaton.

1173
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:31,680
 And when he was at university,

1174
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:34,600
 he was asked by one of his lecturers

1175
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:37,560
 to examine the ankle of a fellow student

1176
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:39,760
 who was called Susan O'Connor.

1177
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:42,240
 And the ankle examination went so well

1178
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:43,960
 that they got married.

1179
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:46,640
 - Wow, that is very good.

1180
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:47,640
 - Did he fall in love with the ankles?

1181
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:48,480
 Do we know?

1182
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:49,800
 - Yeah, and worked his way up.

1183
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:50,640
 - Yeah. - Maybe.

1184
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:55,720
 - She was very cool, Muriel Bristol.

1185
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:57,320
 She worked at this place, Dan described,

1186
00:39:57,320 --> 00:39:58,720
 Rothamsted Experimental Station.

1187
00:39:58,720 --> 00:39:59,560
 - Yeah.

1188
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:00,600
 - And one of the things they had,

1189
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:04,320
 they had soil that was collected in 1846, right?

1190
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:06,440
 And at the time, she was studying the same soil,

1191
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:08,840
 the same sample in 1919.

1192
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:12,360
 And she found that if you feed it little solution

1193
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:15,880
 of minerals, then life appears.

1194
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:17,320
 I tried to find out interesting people

1195
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:22,320
 who would span the dates 1846 to 1919

1196
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:24,480
 very few really interesting people.

1197
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:25,320
 - Okay.

1198
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:26,160
 - Who have you got?

1199
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:28,120
 - Well, 1919 JD Salinger was born,

1200
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:29,200
 catcher in the rye.

1201
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:30,200
 He's pretty cool.

1202
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:31,400
 You know, I like him.

1203
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:33,400
 - He was drinking his own urine by the end,

1204
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:35,040
 which was really interesting.

1205
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:37,880
 - Wow, that's incredibly depressing.

1206
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:40,680
 Do you wanna hear the 1846?

1207
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:41,520
 - Sure.

1208
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:43,400
 - I'd really tried to find people who died in 1846

1209
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:45,680
 who were of interest to us.

1210
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:48,560
 Have you heard of John Ainsworth Horrocks?

1211
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:51,520
 - Yeah, he was killed by his own camel or something, right?

1212
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:52,360
 - Bingo.

1213
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:53,180
 Well, I remembered.

1214
00:40:53,180 --> 00:40:54,020
 Yeah.

1215
00:40:54,020 --> 00:40:54,840
 - What's he?

1216
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:55,680
 - He was one of the early Europeans

1217
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:57,720
 to go very deep into Australia

1218
00:40:57,720 --> 00:40:59,720
 and he was shot by his own camel.

1219
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:00,560
 - Really?

1220
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:01,400
 - Yeah.

1221
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:02,240
 - Okay.

1222
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:03,200
 - And how is he associated with this?

1223
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:06,040
 - He died in 1846,

1224
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:08,640
 which is the year that the soil sample was collected.

1225
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:09,480
 - Oh.

1226
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:10,320
 - Oh.

1227
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:12,720
 - That Muriel Bristol then studied in 1919.

1228
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:14,520
 - And did she collect it from Australia?

1229
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:15,360
 - No.

1230
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:16,200
 No, no one.

1231
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:17,040
 No.

1232
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:19,600
 - It's serious, isn't it?

1233
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:20,440
 - Thanks.

1234
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:21,280
 - I was looking at other,

1235
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:24,920
 cool statistical stuff that's named after randomers

1236
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:26,800
 who don't know anything about the statistics,

1237
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:27,640
 which she didn't.

1238
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:28,460
 She knew about algae.

1239
00:41:28,460 --> 00:41:30,960
 And do you guys know about the Will Rogers paradox?

1240
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:33,240
 - The comedian in America.

1241
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:34,960
 - Of course you know who Will Rogers is.

1242
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:37,120
 The vaudeville 1930s comedian.

1243
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:39,720
 Does anyone else know who Will Rogers is?

1244
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:40,560
 Brilliant, Anne.

1245
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:43,560
 You are so, so good and so niche.

1246
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:45,040
 - Can you imagine the only person in the room

1247
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:47,080
 who knew him is sat right next to you.

1248
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:48,760
 (laughing)

1249
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:50,200
 - So he had a joke

1250
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:52,800
 which had them rolling in the arse in the 30s

1251
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:55,840
 at a time when during the Great Depression

1252
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:58,240
 and a lot of people from Oklahoma had left

1253
00:41:58,240 --> 00:41:59,080
 and moved to California

1254
00:41:59,080 --> 00:41:59,920
 'cause they were very poor.

1255
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:01,240
 They wanted to make a life elsewhere.

1256
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:02,520
 And they were called Okeys.

1257
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:04,280
 And he had a joke which went,

1258
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:07,480
 "Hey, when the Okeys left Oklahoma and moved to California,

1259
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:11,920
 "they raised the average intelligence level in both states."

1260
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:13,000
 Yeah.

1261
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,920
 Still, it still gets a few of them going.

1262
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:15,760
 - Yeah.

1263
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:16,680
 - So that's basically saying,

1264
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:18,000
 "Hey, these guys are so thick

1265
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,360
 "that once they leave Oklahoma,

1266
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:20,440
 "Oklahoma gets smarter."

1267
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:22,200
 But Californians are so thick

1268
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:23,960
 that once they enter California,

1269
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:25,280
 they'll make California smarter.

1270
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:27,080
 The weird thing about this is, right,

1271
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:29,280
 you've made, that is statistically possible,

1272
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:30,160
 if that were true.

1273
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:33,120
 You've made the average intelligence of both places higher.

1274
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:35,440
 But of course, you've only involved the same people.

1275
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:38,840
 So you haven't made the overall average intelligence higher.

1276
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:41,280
 How is this possible?

1277
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:43,560
 And it is possible 'cause it's all about weighted averages

1278
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:45,240
 and we don't need to go into that.

1279
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:47,080
 (laughing)

1280
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:48,920
 I think that's a really cool paradox.

1281
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:52,080
 I'm made up by a comedian who made a silly joke in the 30s

1282
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:54,280
 who didn't know that his name would be placed

1283
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:55,600
 in mathematical history.

1284
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:56,440
 - Yeah, very cool.

1285
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:57,440
 - A good match. - Very cool.

1286
00:42:57,440 --> 00:42:59,360
 - I heard two of you saying...

1287
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:01,840
 - Oh, I know if milk's been poured into the tea

1288
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:02,920
 beforehand or not.

1289
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:03,840
 (audience laughing)

1290
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:05,360
 - Well, we've got four cups of tea here.

1291
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:06,200
 - Oh, piss off.

1292
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:08,160
 (audience laughing)

1293
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:11,680
 - It's James Lee, everyone, our tour manager.

1294
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:13,040
 (audience applauding)

1295
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:14,200
 - Here we go.

1296
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:17,440
 Two have had milk poured in to begin with

1297
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:19,080
 and two have had them in afterwards.

1298
00:43:19,080 --> 00:43:22,160
 Now, have a taste test and let's see if you can...

1299
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:23,160
 - This is for me and Anna.

1300
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:24,480
 - Yeah. - Okay.

1301
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:25,400
 - That one's tea first.

1302
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:26,440
 - Okay.

1303
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:27,520
 - Milk first.

1304
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:29,680
 - Oh, God, it's so sweet.

1305
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:31,640
 - This is captivating, God, yeah.

1306
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:34,400
 (audience laughing)

1307
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:36,000
 - These are both tea first.

1308
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,480
 - You have two tea first.

1309
00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:38,320
 - Yeah, I definitely.

1310
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:40,880
 - Okay, Andy, what are you gonna say then?

1311
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:42,640
 - I think one of mine is milk first.

1312
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:43,760
 - Okay. - It's a lot milkier.

1313
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:45,000
 I'll tell you that much.

1314
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:45,840
 - Yeah.

1315
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:47,320
 - So one of you has to be wrong, right?

1316
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:48,720
 Because there's two and two of each,

1317
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:49,920
 but you've picked two for yourself.

1318
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:52,400
 So, James, which one?

1319
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:55,440
 - Look at the wrong saucer! - Look at the wrong saucer!

1320
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:58,160
 - This is so exciting for us.

1321
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:00,360
 Milk, M for milk first.

1322
00:44:00,360 --> 00:44:02,760
 Bullshit, you've put it on the wrong...

1323
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:04,480
 Put it on the wrong saucer, mate.

1324
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:05,320
 Another M.

1325
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:07,080
 - You've had two.

1326
00:44:07,080 --> 00:44:10,880
 - Both of us, neither of us got it right.

1327
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:13,960
 I got one right and one wrong.

1328
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:15,160
 - You're no Mario Bristol.

1329
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:16,000
 - Oh, man.

1330
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,440
 - Well, look.

1331
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:21,600
 That's it for our show tonight.

1332
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:24,000
 Thank you so much for everyone for being here.

1333
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,840
 Bristol, that was awesome.

1334
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:27,760
 We'll see you again soon.

1335
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:29,040
 We'll be back again next week

1336
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:30,200
 for another episode.

1337
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:31,040
 Goodbye!

1338
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:35,040
 (audience cheering)

1339
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:40,660
 (upbeat music)

1340
00:44:40,660 --> 00:44:43,240

1341
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:46,820
