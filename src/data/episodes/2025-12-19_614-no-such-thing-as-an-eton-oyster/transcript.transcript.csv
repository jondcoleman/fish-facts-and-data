00:00:00,00:00:02,"Merry Christmas, everyone!"
00:00:02,00:00:03,"Oh, ho, ho!"
00:00:03,00:00:04,Yep.
00:00:04,00:00:05,[laughter]
00:00:05,00:00:06,"Thanks, Ben."
00:00:06,00:00:09,"Well, as you can see, we are all in the Christmas spirit,"
00:00:09,00:00:13,and why would we not be because we have a very special guest for you here today?
00:00:13,00:00:18,That's right. It is the man known as the chief gnome of the QI operation.
00:00:18,00:00:21,"He is the person who brought us four, including Anna together,"
00:00:21,00:00:23,to make no such thing as a fish. It is John Lloyd.
00:00:23,00:00:27,"Yes, the Christ figure to our three wise men."
00:00:27,00:00:28,"Oh, my God."
00:00:28,00:00:29,"Okay. Okay, no."
00:00:29,00:00:31,"I'm, I'm, I'm rowing back."
00:00:31,00:00:33,"He's, uh, he's the producer of QI."
00:00:33,00:00:36,He's the producer of every great comedy series you watched.
00:00:36,00:00:39,"Black-annish spitting image, not the 9 o'clock news so much."
00:00:39,00:00:42,"And he's the author of a book called The Meaning of Liff,"
00:00:42,00:00:46,co-written with Douglas Adams 42 years ago.
00:00:46,00:00:48,And it's just been reissued. It's a fantastic book.
00:00:48,00:00:52,"Yeah, this book is basically a dictionary of things that they should be words for."
00:00:52,00:00:54,"Uh, but they don't exist."
00:00:54,00:00:59,"And so, what they've done is there are signs of place names all around the UK"
00:00:59,00:01:01,that don't have any meaning attached to them.
00:01:01,00:01:04,And they've attached these observations to those to create new words.
00:01:04,00:01:05,Like bath?
00:01:05,00:01:06,"Uh, no."
00:01:06,00:01:08,That means that it already has meaning.
00:01:08,00:01:10,"Oh, yeah. Yeah, sandwich, for example."
00:01:10,00:01:14,"That, no, no, you guys are screwing this up."
00:01:14,00:01:15,Demoins?
00:01:15,00:01:18,The two little lines coming down from your nose to your mouth are the demoins?
00:01:18,00:01:21,"Ah, nice. I like ealy. That's always been my favorite."
00:01:21,00:01:25,The first tiniest inkling that's something somewhere has gone terribly wrong.
00:01:25,00:01:27,"Okay, so that's the meaning of Liff."
00:01:27,00:01:28,It's available in all shops now.
00:01:28,00:01:33,"It's a brilliant Christmas present stocking filler main present, I would say."
00:01:33,00:01:34,Absolutely.
00:01:34,00:01:38,"But what if you're listening to this, and it's too late to do the shopping,"
00:01:38,00:01:40,and you need to get the fish lover in your life a gift?
00:01:40,00:01:43,What to do is get the fish listener in your life.
00:01:43,00:01:48,"Membership of club fish are wonderful, super secret, top secret,"
00:01:48,00:01:51,"but also crucially accessible to everyone on the planet, members club."
00:01:51,00:01:53,Absolutely. There's loads of things on there.
00:01:53,00:01:55,There's loads of bonus content.
00:01:55,00:02:00,There is going to be a super special quiz coming up in the new year that we're going to announce.
00:02:00,00:02:03,There are extra long versions of our normal episode.
00:02:03,00:02:08,"There is video episodes of Drop Us Align, which is our audience feedback show."
00:02:08,00:02:12,"Go to patreon.com/no such thing as a fish, and you can get your membership there."
00:02:12,00:02:16,"But in the meantime, please enjoy this episode of No Such Thing as a Fish"
00:02:16,00:02:19,"with John Lloyd, C-B-E."
00:02:19,00:02:22,Christ of the British Empire.
00:02:22,00:02:23,On with the show.
00:02:23,00:02:44,"Hello, and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming"
00:02:44,00:02:47,to you from the QI offices in Hobern.
00:02:47,00:02:48,My name is Dan Schreiber.
00:02:48,00:02:53,"I am sitting here with James Harkin, Andrew Hunter Murray, and John Lloyd."
00:02:53,00:02:57,"Once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven"
00:02:57,00:03:01,"days, and in a particular order, here we go."
00:03:01,00:03:04,"Starting with fact number one, and that is Andy."
00:03:04,00:03:09,"My fact is, the Chicago River used to be sparkling, but only because of all the animal"
00:03:09,00:03:14,carcasses floating in it.
00:03:14,00:03:17,How did dead carcasses make something fizzy?
00:03:17,00:03:19,"Well, they give off methane."
00:03:19,00:03:21,They give off gas.
00:03:21,00:03:27,"Basically, there's a bit of the Chicago River, which was called bubbly creek."
00:03:27,00:03:31,"This is actually a good news story from this year, because finally they've cleaned it up."
00:03:31,00:03:35,"But a hundred years ago, it was really foul."
00:03:35,00:03:36,It was amazing.
00:03:36,00:03:42,"So there's a bit of the Chicago River, which has been full of junk for a century, and"
00:03:42,00:03:46,the reason that it was so bad in that particular bit was because it's next to the Abattoir
00:03:46,00:03:53,"District, the slaughterhouses, all of that, and it was so foul that bits of it were just"
00:03:53,00:03:54,solid at the surface.
00:03:54,00:03:58,The river was just caked with lumps of matter.
00:03:58,00:03:59,"Oh, wow."
00:03:59,00:04:00,So you don't need a bridge?
00:04:00,00:04:01,No bridge required.
00:04:01,00:04:02,"No, no, no."
00:04:02,00:04:03,Exactly.
00:04:03,00:04:04,Really good.
00:04:04,00:04:05,Chickens could walk on it.
00:04:05,00:04:06,Could they?
00:04:06,00:04:07,Completely unharmed.
00:04:07,00:04:08,Who just wander out of this?
00:04:08,00:04:11,"Chickens can swim, so that doesn't really help them that much, can't they?"
00:04:11,00:04:12,They can.
00:04:12,00:04:13,They are my thinking of ducks.
00:04:13,00:04:14,You think of ducks?
00:04:14,00:04:15,Yeah.
00:04:15,00:04:22,"That's because the reason there were so many carcasses in it is because from 1865 to the 1920s,"
00:04:22,00:04:25,more meat was processed in Chicago than anywhere else in the world.
00:04:25,00:04:26,No.
00:04:26,00:04:27,Really?
00:04:27,00:04:28,Wow.
00:04:28,00:04:29,And it's a big foodie place.
00:04:29,00:04:32,I was interested in other kinds of food in Chicago.
00:04:32,00:04:34,Did you know Shredded Wheat was invented in Chicago?
00:04:34,00:04:35,No.
00:04:35,00:04:39,It's premiered at the world's Farron Chicago in 1893 and invented by Henry Perkey.
00:04:39,00:04:40,Yeah.
00:04:40,00:04:41,Okay.
00:04:41,00:04:49,And also 31% of children admitted to the University of Chicago Burn Centre over a 10-year period
00:04:49,00:04:50,were scalded by instant noodles.
00:04:50,00:04:51,"Oh, wow."
00:04:51,00:04:52,Wow.
00:04:52,00:04:53,I've been there.
00:04:53,00:04:54,To that centre.
00:04:54,00:04:55,No.
00:04:55,00:04:58,To the world of scalded hot noodles.
00:04:58,00:04:59,Ah.
00:04:59,00:05:00,Situations.
00:05:00,00:05:01,Yeah.
00:05:01,00:05:02,You've got to let those noodles stand.
00:05:02,00:05:03,Gotta get to them.
00:05:03,00:05:04,Gotta get straighter to them.
00:05:04,00:05:08,"This, you say sparkling, it didn't look nice, did it, right?"
00:05:08,00:05:10,The bubbles were purely the sparkly elements.
00:05:10,00:05:11,"Yes, it did."
00:05:11,00:05:12,I'd say rather than sparkling.
00:05:12,00:05:16,"Because I've got some sparkling water here in front of me, it's beautiful and clear."
00:05:16,00:05:17,"Oh, that's lovely."
00:05:17,00:05:18,"Yeah, yeah."
00:05:18,00:05:21,I put a dead mouse in here before we started just to help it bubble.
00:05:21,00:05:27,"Well, you say, in the bubbly water, though, a liter of bottled water contains an average"
00:05:27,00:05:30,"of 240,000 detectable plastic fragments."
00:05:30,00:05:31,"Oh, dear."
00:05:31,00:05:32,"Oh, right."
00:05:32,00:05:33,Don't drink that.
00:05:33,00:05:34,Don't drink that.
00:05:34,00:05:35,"Here's another one, James."
00:05:35,00:05:39,"Well, the bottles can have 40,000 times more bacteria than a toilet seat."
00:05:39,00:05:42,"Oh, well, this isn't real useful, but this is one that I'm going to chuck away into the"
00:05:42,00:05:43,street afterwards.
00:05:43,00:05:44,Just that.
00:05:44,00:05:47,I'm going to chuck it into the Thames and see what pops up.
00:05:47,00:05:48,Yeah.
00:05:48,00:05:49,Can I tell you a thing about bubbles?
00:05:49,00:05:50,Yes.
00:05:50,00:05:51,Probably water.
00:05:51,00:05:52,Okay.
00:05:52,00:05:57,So London has the ability to spritz its own water.
00:05:57,00:05:58,The Thames?
00:05:58,00:05:59,The Thames.
00:05:59,00:06:05,"It has two boats, the bubble boats, which can inject gas into the river."
00:06:05,00:06:07,Is it just for fun?
00:06:07,00:06:08,It's not.
00:06:08,00:06:10,"It's really important, but it's only occasionally needed, right?"
00:06:10,00:06:16,"So when there is really hot weather, and when there are sometimes sewage over spills,"
00:06:16,00:06:20,"which mostly won't happen anymore because of the new Big Thames Tideway tunnel, which we've"
00:06:20,00:06:21,"talked about, blah, blah, blah."
00:06:21,00:06:25,"But basically, there are times where you just need to inject oxygen into the water so"
00:06:25,00:06:26,fish can breathe.
00:06:26,00:06:27,I see.
00:06:27,00:06:29,So there's a sewage overflow.
00:06:29,00:06:32,That means there's not enough oxygen in there so you need to get some in.
00:06:32,00:06:33,Exactly.
00:06:33,00:06:36,"And there are two boats, they're called bubbler and vitality."
00:06:36,00:06:37,It's an absolute last resort.
00:06:37,00:06:42,"You know, if you're using the oxygenate, the water boat, it's a really bad sign, but they"
00:06:42,00:06:47,can each inject 30 tons of oxygen into the river every day.
00:06:47,00:06:48,That's really cool.
00:06:48,00:06:53,"This is necessary because in 1957, the Thames was declared biologically dead."
00:06:53,00:06:58,"And by 1970, it was so polluted, it has started to dissolve the hulls of boats."
00:06:58,00:06:59,Wow.
00:06:59,00:07:00,It is that toxic.
00:07:00,00:07:01,Oh my gosh.
00:07:01,00:07:02,"Yeah, it's a lot better."
00:07:02,00:07:03,I think it's a lot better out here.
00:07:03,00:07:08,And it's really interesting because the word Thames means river in Celtic.
00:07:08,00:07:14,"Same as the word ""tine"" means river from Old English word ""tinan"", which means to dissolve."
00:07:14,00:07:15,Okay.
00:07:15,00:07:16,That's nice.
00:07:16,00:07:21,It's amazing that we can tell how much oxygen is in the Thames.
00:07:21,00:07:24,That's pretty extraordinary that you would take a sample of one spot and that would tell
00:07:24,00:07:27,you the story of the entire Thames.
00:07:27,00:07:28,"Yeah, you're right."
00:07:28,00:07:29,It just seems quite wild.
00:07:29,00:07:32,I had this thing quite recently where they put a little finger on your finger and they
00:07:32,00:07:34,tell you how much oxygen is in your blood.
00:07:34,00:07:35,How the fuck does that work?
00:07:35,00:07:36,Yeah.
00:07:36,00:07:38,Is it because all your blood goes through your finger at some point or another?
00:07:38,00:07:39,"No, it can't."
00:07:39,00:07:40,Can it?
00:07:40,00:07:41,Can it?
00:07:41,00:07:42,"No, it can't."
00:07:42,00:07:43,"I mean, that's not how it works."
00:07:43,00:07:46,"No, because some of the blood goes out to your leg and then back to the heart."
00:07:46,00:07:47,Yeah.
00:07:47,00:07:48,"You know, it's up to your finger and then back to the heart."
00:07:48,00:07:49,Yeah.
00:07:49,00:07:50,I don't know how it works.
00:07:50,00:07:53,"And I don't want to know, actually, because I have to think it's magic."
00:07:53,00:07:54,Okay.
00:07:54,00:07:59,Here's some stuff on corpses and carcasses.
00:07:59,00:08:04,Do you know there's a theory that anthrax can lure you in?
00:08:04,00:08:05,Oh.
00:08:05,00:08:06,Yeah.
00:08:06,00:08:10,So the idea is that anthrax gets into an animal.
00:08:10,00:08:11,The animal dies.
00:08:11,00:08:16,And then the animal sort of fertilises the ground and so it gets more lush.
00:08:16,00:08:19,And then that gets more animals to go to it.
00:08:19,00:08:24,And then those animals catch the anthrax and then they die.
00:08:24,00:08:26,And there's an idea that that's how it's evolved.
00:08:26,00:08:27,That's its life cycle.
00:08:27,00:08:28,Isn't that cool?
00:08:28,00:08:29,Yes.
00:08:29,00:08:30,That's very cool.
00:08:30,00:08:32,It's so weird that that stuff got out.
00:08:32,00:08:38,"Well, I guess we've, I make that sound as if it's like the anthrax is going, ""Shh, shhh."""
00:08:38,00:08:41,"Like, you know, I've turned it into a human in my mind."
00:08:41,00:08:45,"You know, we have to anthropomorphize a lot of these facts to make them interesting."
00:08:45,00:08:46,Yeah.
00:08:46,00:08:50,"And the other thing that I found is I went to a place called Padarac in France, it's a big"
00:08:50,00:08:51,sort of cave.
00:08:51,00:08:56,"And they said that in the 20th century, in some parts of France, there was a law that if"
00:08:56,00:09:00,"your animal got diseased and died, you have to go and throw it into the nearest chasm."
00:09:00,00:09:01,"Oh, chasm."
00:09:01,00:09:03,That's what they called it.
00:09:03,00:09:07,"Like, to be further one in Padarac is like a big chasm and they thought the devil lived"
00:09:07,00:09:08,down there and stuff.
00:09:08,00:09:12,"It was like one of those, you know, it's like a sinkhole kind of..."
00:09:12,00:09:13,"Right, right, right."
00:09:13,00:09:17,The problem is that the rivers go underneath these chasms and they're attached to the water
00:09:17,00:09:18,supply.
00:09:18,00:09:22,So you throw in your anthrax cow or sheep and then it gets into the water and people get
00:09:22,00:09:23,sick that way.
00:09:23,00:09:24,"No, yeah."
00:09:24,00:09:25,So it was a misguided law.
00:09:25,00:09:27,Is there so many of them are?
00:09:27,00:09:28,Question.
00:09:28,00:09:29,Yeah.
00:09:29,00:09:31,What's the difference between a chasm and a gorge?
00:09:31,00:09:32,"Oh, well."
00:09:32,00:09:40,I would say that a chasm is caused by a collapse of land to make a hole whereas a gorge
00:09:40,00:09:42,is caused by a river.
00:09:42,00:09:44,"Right, so it's like a huge river."
00:09:44,00:09:48,"A river is like almost like a big, shaped valley caused by a fast flowing river."
00:09:48,00:09:49,Yeah.
00:09:49,00:09:50,"A gorge, sorry."
00:09:50,00:09:51,A gorge.
00:09:51,00:09:52,"Right, right."
00:09:52,00:09:53,And a canyon?
00:09:53,00:09:54,Same.
00:09:54,00:09:55,"Same, but bigger."
00:09:55,00:09:56,Big river.
00:09:56,00:09:57,Canyon is an American gorge.
00:09:57,00:09:58,Big river.
00:09:58,00:10:00,Do you know what a current bum is?
00:10:00,00:10:01,A current bum.
00:10:01,00:10:05,"A current bum is a rock under the surface of a river, which gives that sort of hump thing."
00:10:05,00:10:06,"Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:10:06,00:10:07,What is covered in water?
00:10:07,00:10:08,Yeah.
00:10:08,00:10:09,The water goes over a boulder.
00:10:09,00:10:10,"Oh, sure."
00:10:10,00:10:12,And how far is that just known?
00:10:12,00:10:13,It's actually called.
00:10:13,00:10:15,"It's a book called Landscape, where Robert McFarlane, which I highly recommend."
00:10:15,00:10:16,Right.
00:10:16,00:10:18,"Right, dialect words all over the country."
00:10:18,00:10:19,Very cool.
00:10:19,00:10:20,"The river is now clean, Andy."
00:10:20,00:10:21,You said the Chicago River.
00:10:21,00:10:22,Yes.
00:10:22,00:10:25,"Except, once a year, it looks like toxic goo."
00:10:25,00:10:26,Oh.
00:10:26,00:10:30,"And that's because of some Patrick's day, they die the river, the entire river, green."
00:10:30,00:10:31,Lovely.
00:10:31,00:10:32,Yeah.
00:10:32,00:10:33,Lovely?
00:10:33,00:10:34,"Well, I celebrate Irish Heritage Shaves."
00:10:34,00:10:35,I don't know why you don't.
00:10:35,00:10:36,What?
00:10:36,00:10:40,Because I add part Irish.
00:10:40,00:10:41,But I refuse.
00:10:41,00:10:43,I just straight up refuse.
00:10:43,00:10:44,"What, I don't know what that is."
00:10:44,00:10:49,"Well, I think the question is, is it okay, like, are they putting in toxic goo, or are they"
00:10:49,00:10:50,putting in food coloring?
00:10:50,00:10:51,Food coloring.
00:10:51,00:10:55,"They started with toxic goo, and that quickly got speed back."
00:10:55,00:11:01,"I think they did, because it started by accident in 1961 when some people were putting"
00:11:01,00:11:06,dye into the water to see where like a leak had come out or to see where the water flowed.
00:11:06,00:11:09,And then it was around St. Patrick's Day.
00:11:09,00:11:12,"So everyone thought, oh, they did that on purpose."
00:11:12,00:11:14,"And they went, oh, we didn't, but let's do it on purpose in future."
00:11:14,00:11:16,But that dye was toxic.
00:11:16,00:11:17,Ah.
00:11:17,00:11:18,There you go.
00:11:18,00:11:19,That's very funny.
00:11:19,00:11:21,The Chicago River is a friend of the podcast.
00:11:21,00:11:22,Yeah.
00:11:22,00:11:23,"Also, it is."
00:11:23,00:11:28,"Because in 2004, the Dave Matthews band drove over it in their bus and dumped an estimated"
00:11:28,00:11:33,800 pounds of human feces onto a passenger sightseeing boat.
00:11:33,00:11:34,Oh.
00:11:34,00:11:35,Yes.
00:11:35,00:11:37,That's a hundred pounds of feces from their bus.
00:11:37,00:11:40,They've been saving it up.
00:11:40,00:11:41,The tour bus.
00:11:41,00:11:42,That's a hell of a tour.
00:11:42,00:11:43,Was it through a grating?
00:11:43,00:11:44,It was through a grating.
00:11:44,00:11:45,Yeah.
00:11:45,00:11:47,And you imagine being on that boat.
00:11:47,00:11:49,Celebrity feces all early.
00:11:49,00:11:51,"You wouldn't know it was celebrity, though."
00:11:51,00:11:53,"If you knew it's celebrity, that might take the edge off."
00:11:53,00:11:57,"Do you think if you saw Dave Matthews waving out the window, you'd go, how lucky are we?"
00:11:57,00:12:00,I don't think Dave Matthews is of a level of celebrity enough.
00:12:00,00:12:01,No.
00:12:01,00:12:02,No.
00:12:02,00:12:03,I know his face.
00:12:03,00:12:05,I'd want it to be a list.
00:12:05,00:12:07,He won't tell the Swiss bus traveling.
00:12:07,00:12:08,"Source of, yeah."
00:12:08,00:12:09,Right.
00:12:09,00:12:12,That's going to be mixed with Travis Kelsey's carcass.
00:12:12,00:12:13,Too much.
00:12:13,00:12:18,"In the meaning of live, the Chicago is defined as the foul smelling wind that precedes"
00:12:18,00:12:19,an underground train.
00:12:19,00:12:20,Oh.
00:12:20,00:12:23,"Might, of course, be one of Dave Matthews' fans."
00:12:23,00:12:26,But it was known as the Stinking River.
00:12:26,00:12:27,Wasn't it the Chicago River?
00:12:27,00:12:30,That's what locals called it all the way through the 20th century.
00:12:30,00:12:31,It was really.
00:12:31,00:12:32,It sounds like it was so bad.
00:12:32,00:12:36,And a lot of the contemporary descriptions of how awful it was come from this brilliant
00:12:36,00:12:41,"book, The Jungle, by a writer called Up to the Sling Claire, who wrote, it was a journalistic"
00:12:41,00:12:45,"exposé, really, of the slaughterhouses and their practices and just how, you know,"
00:12:45,00:12:48,appalling the quality was there.
00:12:48,00:12:51,So I'll just read you a couple of sentences of it.
00:12:51,00:12:56,"The material brought to the surface was as black as ink, a considerable amount of gas"
00:12:56,00:13:00,"was given off, which was so evil smelling that it could be detected even above the"
00:13:00,00:13:03,prevailing odour from the stockyard pens.
00:13:03,00:13:04,"Oh, my God."
00:13:04,00:13:05,I know.
00:13:05,00:13:11,"And sometimes the river would catch fire because it was so, wow, and sometimes people would wander"
00:13:11,00:13:12,out.
00:13:12,00:13:13,I'm presumably chasing your chicken.
00:13:13,00:13:14,Yeah.
00:13:14,00:13:15,And you try to get it back.
00:13:15,00:13:16,And then they just disappear below the surface.
00:13:16,00:13:17,Could they get out a bit into it?
00:13:17,00:13:21,You mean they could walk over some glove and then disappear at that sense?
00:13:21,00:13:22,No.
00:13:22,00:13:23,Up to the Sling Claire.
00:13:23,00:13:24,"Oh, yeah."
00:13:24,00:13:25,He was known as like a mucker acre.
00:13:25,00:13:29,He wrote fiction that exposed what was going on in society and quite a few laws were
00:13:29,00:13:33,changed off the back of different books that he wrote over the course of his life.
00:13:33,00:13:34,So he's really important.
00:13:34,00:13:39,"But I also have a book of his at my house, which is called Mental Radio."
00:13:39,00:13:44,And it's a book he wrote all about his experiments with telepathy because his wife Mary believed
00:13:44,00:13:46,that she had telepathic abilities.
00:13:46,00:13:51,So we're tell these really awesome people getting a bit woo woo towards the end.
00:13:51,00:13:52,Yeah.
00:13:52,00:13:55,"If you look at all these, all the people who invented quantum mechanics, for example,"
00:13:55,00:14:01,"became really mystical towards the end of their life because, you know, Schrodinger."
00:14:01,00:14:05,"I guess it is kind of like, it's almost like magic, isn't it?"
00:14:05,00:14:06,Quantum.
00:14:06,00:14:07,"Yeah, quantum gifts."
00:14:07,00:14:08,Quantum gifts.
00:14:08,00:14:09,"Yeah, I think you go."
00:14:09,00:14:12,"You once you've done a lifetime of science, you think actually, but why, why is there something"
00:14:12,00:14:13,and not nothing?
00:14:13,00:14:17,Because I've got a friend who was a Nobel Prize winner called Brian Josephson who invented
00:14:17,00:14:19,the Josephson Junction.
00:14:19,00:14:20,"Oh, yeah."
00:14:20,00:14:25,So it's a super-knocked guy who is basically slightly sent to Coventry in Cambridge because
00:14:25,00:14:30,he's become a Buddhist and become very spiritual and he's the most wonderful person.
00:14:30,00:14:34,"I think in the University of Cambridge, they don't say sent to Coventry, they say sent"
00:14:34,00:14:35,to the University of Warwick.
00:14:35,00:14:40,"That's very, Schrodinger, but yeah, Albert Einstein wrote it forward to the German edition"
00:14:40,00:14:42,"of Mental Radio, so even he was interested in it."
00:14:42,00:14:44,"Yeah, so who often, Sinclair, was a very interesting character."
00:14:44,00:14:47,"Sounds like a good, it's a good name for a radio station."
00:14:47,00:14:49,Welcome to Mental Radio.
00:14:49,00:14:53,"It's no music, it's just Prince."
00:14:53,00:14:54,That's it.
00:14:54,00:14:56,"Steve Pank, Walter Walls, Steve Pank."
00:14:56,00:14:59,"But the thing about celebrity, I'm slightly telepathic."
00:14:59,00:15:00,"Oh, here we go."
00:15:00,00:15:05,"I can do, there's an online site where you can do, I get scores way, way way above chance."
00:15:05,00:15:06,Right.
00:15:06,00:15:09,It's that you have to guess where a thing is under a hidden map as it is.
00:15:09,00:15:12,"That's called My Sweeper, isn't it?"
00:15:12,00:15:16,I'm actually getting telepathic messages right now from Andy and James Sinclair and what
00:15:16,00:15:19,the fuck have you done to our podcast by introducing this subject?
00:15:19,00:15:20,Can you hear it?
00:15:20,00:15:30,"Okay, it is time for fact number two and that is My Fact."
00:15:30,00:15:35,"My Fact this week is that in Hawaii, a tightly guarded secret that used to be passed down"
00:15:35,00:15:40,from generation to generation was how people used to tune their guitars.
00:15:40,00:15:41,Sorry.
00:15:41,00:15:45,"Surely everyone knows that, there's little knobs aren't there on the end."
00:15:45,00:15:47,"We'll see what I tell you, dude."
00:15:47,00:15:49,I don't know how to tune a guitar.
00:15:49,00:15:53,"Honestly, if we left you in a room with a guitar, you'd work it out pretty fast."
00:15:53,00:15:55,"If you'd say those knobs, they'd sound changes."
00:15:55,00:15:59,"Well, I know you turn the knobs, but I don't know, I'm very impressed when I see anyone"
00:15:59,00:16:00,do it.
00:16:00,00:16:01,And also you shouldn't be.
00:16:01,00:16:03,"You wouldn't know what you were tuning it to, right?"
00:16:03,00:16:04,"Oh, that's it."
00:16:04,00:16:05,That's the thing.
00:16:05,00:16:11,"So a guitar, if you play a classical guitar, like I would tune a guitar or maybe James would"
00:16:11,00:16:15,"tune a guitar, you're tuning is E-A-D-G-B-E, that's sort of the classic."
00:16:15,00:16:19,"And you can make classic E notes, G notes, all that, it's basic stuff, if you don't understand"
00:16:19,00:16:20,"that at all, do we?"
00:16:20,00:16:21,No.
00:16:21,00:16:25,"If you tune it that way, that means wherever you put your fingers on the guitar, it will always"
00:16:25,00:16:26,sound the same.
00:16:26,00:16:27,Yeah.
00:16:27,00:16:29,"And you just know where to put them, because you know how each one is."
00:16:29,00:16:30,Okay.
00:16:30,00:16:31,Okay.
00:16:31,00:16:32,Child deserves fun.
00:16:32,00:16:33,What happened?
00:16:33,00:16:34,Is that what it is?
00:16:34,00:16:35,"Oh, that's the staves of a musical score, isn't it?"
00:16:35,00:16:37,"Oh, every good boy deserves favor?"
00:16:37,00:16:38,"That's it, yes."
00:16:38,00:16:39,Yeah.
00:16:39,00:16:40,Yeah.
00:16:40,00:16:43,"But this is very interesting, because this is slack key guitar in Hawaii."
00:16:43,00:16:49,It's a Hawaiian guitar tradition that has been part of their world for hundreds of years.
00:16:49,00:16:56,And the idea is that they all tune it differently to an open set of notes.
00:16:56,00:17:00,"When you then play it as an open chord, so you don't use your other hand, it plays a lovely"
00:17:00,00:17:01,in chord.
00:17:01,00:17:07,And every family seemed to have designed its own different set of notes unique to them.
00:17:07,00:17:10,And that's what would be passed down from family to family.
00:17:10,00:17:14,"Now the reason that this happened is almost to do with what you were saying, Andy."
00:17:14,00:17:20,"So when Captain Cook first came to Hawaii, there was a guy on board called Captain Vancouver"
00:17:20,00:17:23,who was the captain of the next vote that came to Hawaii.
00:17:23,00:17:27,"And he brought a bunch of cattle, and the cattle arrived and it was roaming around."
00:17:27,00:17:29,And the king of Hawaii didn't know what to do with them.
00:17:29,00:17:30,"Well, there's this guy."
00:17:30,00:17:32,"Oh, this is the origin story of the guitar in Hawaii."
00:17:32,00:17:33,It's really interesting.
00:17:33,00:17:38,"Now, in those days in Hawaii, we always tied that idea to our balance."
00:17:38,00:17:40,[laughs]
00:17:40,00:17:42,Cattles roving free in Hawaii.
00:17:42,00:17:43,They don't know what to do.
00:17:43,00:17:47,So they decided to bring in some Mexican and Spanish cowboys to teach them how to farm.
00:17:47,00:17:48,The hells!
00:17:48,00:17:49,"Yes, exactly."
00:17:49,00:17:50,They brought their guitars.
00:17:50,00:17:52,They played the guitars.
00:17:52,00:17:55,"And then when they left, they left them the guitars."
00:17:55,00:17:58,"After a while, a bunch of them went, ""How do we even tune these things?"""
00:17:58,00:18:00,And they weren't quite sure the classical tunings.
00:18:00,00:18:02,So they had to create their own tunings.
00:18:02,00:18:04,"And family by family, this is what they did."
00:18:04,00:18:06,And all these beautiful songs started emerging.
00:18:06,00:18:10,"Dan, you sent down a link like we always do with these facts just so that we can check"
00:18:10,00:18:12,that they're true.
00:18:12,00:18:13,And we all do it.
00:18:13,00:18:14,We all do it.
00:18:14,00:18:15,We all do it.
00:18:15,00:18:16,We all do it.
00:18:16,00:18:17,We all do it.
00:18:17,00:18:18,We all do it.
00:18:18,00:18:19,"I mean, this idea came about because of Dan's rights."
00:18:19,00:18:20,But we all do it.
00:18:20,00:18:21,"Yeah, yeah."
00:18:21,00:18:23,And this was about a guy called Raymond Cane.
00:18:23,00:18:28,But he has a middle name that I wonder if he read his middle name.
00:18:28,00:18:29,"Oh, yes, I did."
00:18:29,00:18:30,Yeah.
00:18:30,00:18:31,"Well, you're so good at pronouncing things, Dan."
00:18:31,00:18:34,I wonder if he'd like to just remind us what his middle name is.
00:18:34,00:18:35,"Oh, my God."
00:18:35,00:18:36,Yeah.
00:18:36,00:18:37,It's just there.
00:18:37,00:18:38,"Oh, OK."
00:18:38,00:18:41,"Well, this is going to be embarrassing for you because as it turns out, this is my middle name"
00:18:41,00:18:42,as well.
00:18:42,00:18:49,So it's Cali o aloha poina alle o hele manu.
00:18:49,00:18:50,"No, hele manu."
00:18:50,00:18:52,"Oh, he's got so close."
00:18:52,00:18:54,So doing the Australian.
00:18:54,00:18:59,Do you know Alan Davis and I went to see the Swedish version of QI years ago.
00:18:59,00:19:00,"Oh, yeah."
00:19:00,00:19:05,"And as the producer, very sweetly said, John, it's such an honor to have you here as the"
00:19:05,00:19:10,"director of the whole thing that we, it's, you know, would you kindly introduce the guests"
00:19:10,00:19:14,and you gave me the list of Swedish guests and I read them all out and they're audience
00:19:14,00:19:15,were in his steering.
00:19:15,00:19:18,I didn't get one syllable right.
00:19:18,00:19:19,They were screaming.
00:19:19,00:19:22,Who was Raymond Cane?
00:19:22,00:19:23,He was.
00:19:23,00:19:24,Good question.
00:19:24,00:19:25,He was a slack key guitarist.
00:19:25,00:19:26,OK.
00:19:26,00:19:29,And I think the thing you sent around was no bit tree of him.
00:19:29,00:19:30,It was.
00:19:30,00:19:31,"Yeah, that's right."
00:19:31,00:19:34,"I don't play the guitar at all, but I do play a bit of piano."
00:19:34,00:19:35,Yep.
00:19:35,00:19:39,"And obviously one thing I know is about pianos where middle C is, but I didn't know and"
00:19:39,00:19:40,this is the most interesting thing.
00:19:40,00:19:46,I think I found out in the whole month is there are three middle C's on the guitar.
00:19:46,00:19:48,"Did you, did you work that out yourself when you were tuning it?"
00:19:48,00:19:53,"If you're tuning on your own, you'll use your lowest E string as a guide to the next"
00:19:53,00:19:54,string because you can play all the chords.
00:19:54,00:19:57,I do the other way from the highest E string onto the next one.
00:19:57,00:19:58,Right.
00:19:58,00:19:59,"So what you, what you do is you find."
00:19:59,00:20:00,But do you know where middle C is?
00:20:00,00:20:01,Yeah.
00:20:01,00:20:02,OK.
00:20:02,00:20:03,Name it.
00:20:03,00:20:04,OK.
00:20:04,00:20:05,First.
00:20:05,00:20:06,First.
00:20:06,00:20:07,First of the second string.
00:20:07,00:20:08,Fifth of the third string.
00:20:08,00:20:09,And tenth of the fourth string.
00:20:09,00:20:11,I don't know what any of those things mean.
00:20:11,00:20:12,OK.
00:20:12,00:20:13,This is also why the quiz failed.
00:20:13,00:20:15,You give the artist before the person gets the guess.
00:20:15,00:20:16,"Oh, yeah, yeah."
00:20:16,00:20:18,But then I'm allowed to say.
00:20:18,00:20:20,"I'm allowed to say, yeah, I do all that."
00:20:20,00:20:21,I get the point.
00:20:21,00:20:23,I'm trade secrets in music.
00:20:23,00:20:24,"Oh, yeah."
00:20:24,00:20:25,As this is a bit of a trade secret.
00:20:25,00:20:26,Yeah.
00:20:26,00:20:28,How these Hawaiian families kept their guitars.
00:20:28,00:20:34,That is proof legally that an album can be a trade secret.
00:20:34,00:20:35,What does that mean?
00:20:35,00:20:36,OK.
00:20:36,00:20:38,Have you heard of the Wuteng clan show?
00:20:38,00:20:39,"Oh, yeah."
00:20:39,00:20:40,I've seen them.
00:20:40,00:20:41,"I saw them in Aspen, Colorado."
00:20:41,00:20:42,Amazing.
00:20:42,00:20:46,Why do you used to be in the Wuteng club?
00:20:46,00:20:47,The Lizzer.
00:20:47,00:20:48,Yeah.
00:20:48,00:20:49,This is one of the most amazing things.
00:20:49,00:20:50,Imagine you're at a Wuteng gig.
00:20:50,00:20:53,You turn around and John Lloyd and Rowan Atkinston.
00:20:53,00:20:55,Mr. Bean is standing at a Wuteng kind.
00:20:55,00:20:56,Yeah.
00:20:56,00:20:57,"That's what you went to, right?"
00:20:57,00:20:57,Yeah.
00:20:57,00:20:58,Yeah.
00:20:58,00:21:02,So is this about the time when they released one record?
00:21:02,00:21:03,One record.
00:21:03,00:21:04,Yes.
00:21:04,00:21:10,"They released, they recorded a secret album in 2007 and they made one hard copy of it."
00:21:10,00:21:13,So it doesn't exist outside this hard copy of it.
00:21:13,00:21:15,"And an American, a wealthy American guy called Martin Shrekley."
00:21:15,00:21:16,Super controversial.
00:21:16,00:21:17,Yeah.
00:21:17,00:21:18,Super controversial.
00:21:18,00:21:19,Yeah.
00:21:19,00:21:20,Super controversial.
00:21:20,00:21:21,Yeah.
00:21:21,00:21:22,Super controversial.
00:21:22,00:21:23,He bought it for $2 million.
00:21:23,00:21:25,And there were very strict restrictions on how it could be played or reproduced for all
00:21:25,00:21:28,of that for the next 90 odd years.
00:21:28,00:21:32,"Eventually, in unrelated reasons, he was sent to prison for fraud."
00:21:32,00:21:33,"No, no, no."
00:21:33,00:21:38,I think they might have been slightly related to the fact that he had 2 million quid to spend
00:21:38,00:21:39,on one record.
00:21:39,00:21:40,Okay.
00:21:40,00:21:41,So that's very true.
00:21:41,00:21:42,Yeah.
00:21:42,00:21:43,Yeah.
00:21:43,00:21:44,Yeah.
00:21:44,00:21:45,"I think, just for the..."
00:21:45,00:21:46,"No, you're absolutely right."
00:21:46,00:21:47,Just for the lion's listening.
00:21:47,00:21:50,"So as part of that deal, he, as part of him going to prison for fraud, the album had to be"
00:21:50,00:21:51,"sold off, right?"
00:21:51,00:21:55,And it got sold off to a crypto firm called Pleasardau.
00:21:55,00:22:00,"And then when Shrekley got out, nonetheless, despite the album having been sold off, he started"
00:22:00,00:22:02,playing it for loads of people online.
00:22:02,00:22:03,Yeah.
00:22:03,00:22:04,And the crypto firm sued him.
00:22:04,00:22:08,And all of this led to a judge decreeing that an album can be technically a tried secret.
00:22:08,00:22:09,Yeah.
00:22:09,00:22:12,"I've got two secrets from the meaning of Liff, two secrety words."
00:22:12,00:22:13,"Oh, cool."
00:22:13,00:22:18,"Mary Tavi, which you probably know is a place in Devon, a Mary Tavi is a person to whom"
00:22:18,00:22:24,"under dire injunctions of silence, you tell a secret you wish to be far more widely known."
00:22:24,00:22:25,Lovely.
00:22:25,00:22:26,Useful one.
00:22:26,00:22:32,"And Tuky Tuky, which is a place in New Zealand, Tuky Tuky is a sexual liaison, which is meant"
00:22:32,00:22:35,"to be secret, but which is, in fact, common knowledge."
00:22:35,00:22:37,That's a nice word.
00:22:37,00:22:38,Chartres.
00:22:38,00:22:39,"Oh, yeah."
00:22:39,00:22:40,Drink?
00:22:40,00:22:41,Yes.
00:22:41,00:22:42,Green.
00:22:42,00:22:43,Yeah.
00:22:43,00:22:44,The recipe is only known by two monks.
00:22:44,00:22:45,No.
00:22:45,00:22:46,Apparently so.
00:22:46,00:22:47,Really?
00:22:47,00:22:48,Yeah.
00:22:48,00:22:51,Tuky Kola one famously is bit secret.
00:22:51,00:22:54,"You know, they use Chartres to die the Chicago ribbon?"
00:22:54,00:22:55,Of course that's not.
00:22:55,00:22:56,Yeah.
00:22:56,00:22:58,That's where the fish are so cheerful all the time.
00:22:58,00:22:59,Yeah.
00:22:59,00:23:00,The Coca-Cola one's really interesting.
00:23:00,00:23:06,"So they have like a secret formula, which they say, oh, no one can work out what this"
00:23:06,00:23:07,is and all that.
00:23:07,00:23:09,"And actually, you can kind of pretty easily work out what it is."
00:23:09,00:23:14,But obviously Pepsi has the same thing because they make arguably the same drink.
00:23:14,00:23:17,"I know they slightly taste different, but they're pretty much the same thing."
00:23:17,00:23:20,But why do they not have secret ingredients?
00:23:20,00:23:23,"Like they don't say, oh, we have a secret thing called 7x that nobody knows about."
00:23:23,00:23:24,Yeah.
00:23:24,00:23:27,Because no one really likes Pepsi.
00:23:27,00:23:28,No.
00:23:28,00:23:29,Is that it?
00:23:29,00:23:30,No.
00:23:30,00:23:33,Because I think you'll find that the advertising campaign in the 90s showed that everyone
00:23:33,00:23:35,loves Pepsi.
00:23:35,00:23:36,And today we're sponsored.
00:23:36,00:23:37,No.
00:23:37,00:23:38,Yeah.
00:23:38,00:23:44,"Basically, they just use normal law and just make people sign non-disclosure agreements."
00:23:44,00:23:48,"And if they give the secrets away, they sue them and stuff rather than saying that they have"
00:23:48,00:23:51,some sort of secret ingredient that no one can know.
00:23:51,00:23:58,Because it does seem mad that you can keep like with so much regulation and all the warnings
00:23:58,00:23:59,on the back of a packet.
00:23:59,00:24:01,We can just have a secret sauce in there.
00:24:01,00:24:06,"You have to sort of, I think you have to register it somewhere, but it's accepted legally as"
00:24:06,00:24:07,a trade secret.
00:24:07,00:24:08,That's the thing.
00:24:08,00:24:09,Got it.
00:24:09,00:24:10,So it is a special legal framework.
00:24:10,00:24:13,"It's got an injunction on it, basically, kind of."
00:24:13,00:24:14,But there is a thing.
00:24:14,00:24:15,Okay.
00:24:15,00:24:16,"It's our age for nilla, cinnamon, and..."
00:24:16,00:24:17,Don't say the five.
00:24:17,00:24:18,Don't say the one or the one.
00:24:18,00:24:20,And dead animals.
00:24:20,00:24:25,"Well, we had an email from listener Esther Nelken who says, ""You may have covered this"
00:24:25,00:24:26,"previously."""
00:24:26,00:24:28,We haven't covered this previously.
00:24:28,00:24:33,"But in order for Coca-Cola to be recognised as kosher, a rabbi had to be told the secret"
00:24:33,00:24:38,"formula in 1935, rabbi Tobias Geffen signed an NDA and was allowed to investigate the"
00:24:38,00:24:39,ingredients.
00:24:39,00:24:40,Wow.
00:24:40,00:24:43,"And she adds, ""I couldn't find who the rabbi is today who holds the information."""
00:24:43,00:24:48,"That's a damn brown novel waiting to be written, isn't it?"
00:24:48,00:24:49,So right.
00:24:49,00:24:50,You're so right.
00:24:50,00:24:53,I've got some specifically Hawaiian secrets here.
00:24:53,00:24:54,"Oh, cool."
00:24:54,00:24:58,"That physicist at the University of Hawaii have recently solved the problem, the secret of"
00:24:58,00:25:02,how washing machines get clothes clean.
00:25:02,00:25:03,It's never been known until now.
00:25:03,00:25:04,Wow.
00:25:04,00:25:08,So there are now two physicists who know the secret of how that works.
00:25:08,00:25:11,And the other one is that 2018 was a bad year for Hawaii.
00:25:11,00:25:15,They had a massive volcanic explosion.
00:25:15,00:25:20,"And the authorities warned people not to toast marshmallows over it, which was a very"
00:25:20,00:25:21,good advice.
00:25:21,00:25:27,"But they also had in 2018, 38 minutes of panic, after a wrongly pressed button set off an"
00:25:27,00:25:30,alert warning of an incoming ballistic missile attack.
00:25:30,00:25:31,Wow.
00:25:31,00:25:35,And the way it's connected with secret is the governor of Hawaii couldn't correct the
00:25:35,00:25:40,false missile alert for 17 minutes because he didn't know how to log on to his own Twitter
00:25:40,00:25:42,and Facebook accounts.
00:25:42,00:25:43,Wow.
00:25:43,00:25:44,They were kept from him.
00:25:44,00:25:48,"Well, only one rabbi in Hawaii knew what the password was."
00:25:48,00:25:50,"That was mad, wasn't it, when that happened?"
00:25:50,00:25:51,Yeah.
00:25:51,00:25:55,"I think a lot of people just started going round telling, you know, telling people about"
00:25:55,00:25:57,the secretly A-zons and stuff like that because of all of them.
00:25:57,00:25:58,Dookie dookie.
00:25:58,00:25:59,It's the end of the world.
00:25:59,00:26:02,We did it in the book that we were writing the books of the year at the time and there
00:26:02,00:26:04,was definitely an article about that.
00:26:04,00:26:05,Yes.
00:26:05,00:26:09,"And I think it's, I think it was the second time that the person who accidentally sent"
00:26:09,00:26:11,the alert out had made this mistake.
00:26:11,00:26:15,"And it was, it was something stupid, like there were two buttons next to each other."
00:26:15,00:26:17,"It was, I think it was a drop down menu."
00:26:17,00:26:18,That's right.
00:26:18,00:26:23,And it was a drop down menu and it was send nuclear alert brackets test or send out of office
00:26:23,00:26:24,reply.
00:26:24,00:26:25,Yeah.
00:26:25,00:26:33,"Okay, it is time for fact number three."
00:26:33,00:26:34,That is James.
00:26:34,00:26:40,"Okay, my fact this week is that in 1874, the world's largest pearl got lost down the back"
00:26:40,00:26:42,of a sofa.
00:26:42,00:26:46,And was this a kind of princess on the P-style situation?
00:26:46,00:26:47,Expand.
00:26:47,00:26:50,"Well, yeah, easy."
00:26:50,00:26:51,Okay.
00:26:51,00:26:54,They kept putting cushions on top of the sofa.
00:26:54,00:26:55,Yeah.
00:26:55,00:26:58,"And it was only found when, I can't remember the original fairy tale now, is it the true"
00:26:58,00:27:02,princess can identify the world's largest pearl down the back of a sofa?
00:27:02,00:27:03,Is it James?
00:27:03,00:27:04,It's not that.
00:27:04,00:27:05,It's not that.
00:27:05,00:27:10,It's not that complete misrememberance of a fairy story.
00:27:10,00:27:11,Anyone else?
00:27:11,00:27:15,"No, this is something I read in BBC History magazine."
00:27:15,00:27:22,It was an article by Kate Williams and it's about the La Peregrina pearl and sofa in Windsor
00:27:22,00:27:27,Castle and how the two things interacted in 1874.
00:27:27,00:27:33,And it was a woman called the Duchess of Abacorn who was at a party with her husband
00:27:33,00:27:39,James Hamilton and she momentarily lost a pearl down the back of the sofa but it was enough
00:27:39,00:27:41,that it was recorded and we now know about it.
00:27:41,00:27:48,Is it such a massive pearl that it would seriously damage the sofa?
00:27:48,00:27:49,No.
00:27:49,00:27:50,How big is it?
00:27:50,00:27:52,Would you feel a lump if you sat down on it?
00:27:52,00:27:53,That's what I'm trying to think.
00:27:53,00:27:54,Like the princess and the P.
00:27:54,00:27:56,"Oh, I was thinking more of the current buns."
00:27:56,00:27:57,"Current buns, yeah, true."
00:27:57,00:27:58,Yeah.
00:27:58,00:28:02,"If you sat directly onto it with no sofa involved, you would feel it on your bum."
00:28:02,00:28:03,"Yeah, sure."
00:28:03,00:28:09,"In the sofa, I don't think so because it is about 11.2 grams in weight, which is about the"
00:28:09,00:28:13,same weight as a world's smallest monkey.
00:28:13,00:28:17,"If you sat on the world's smallest monkey, would you feel that?"
00:28:17,00:28:18,"You'd feel it, but not this."
00:28:18,00:28:19,It's like a cushion.
00:28:19,00:28:22,"You'd feel it for sure, but not necessarily if it was inside a sofa."
00:28:22,00:28:25,And can you give us a size rather than the weight?
00:28:25,00:28:28,"No, I'm afraid I can give you more versions of the weight."
00:28:28,00:28:36,"So it was 55.95 carrots, four ounces or 223.8 grains."
00:28:36,00:28:41,How long was this this very large or small weight and with a certain weight?
00:28:41,00:28:42,How long was it lost for?
00:28:42,00:28:45,"It was lost, momentarily."
00:28:45,00:28:47,This is a fascinating fact.
00:28:47,00:28:48,It was weight.
00:28:48,00:28:49,I've lost my glasses.
00:28:49,00:28:51,"No, there they are on my head."
00:28:51,00:28:55,It was interesting enough that Kate Williams wrote about a BBC history magazine.
00:28:55,00:28:58,What I think of the most interesting thing is how small monkeys get these.
00:28:58,00:28:59,I'm staggered.
00:28:59,00:29:02,An adult monkey that weighs 11 grams.
00:29:02,00:29:03,Have you seen those monkeys?
00:29:03,00:29:06,There's like these monkeys that you put them on your finger and they just hold on like
00:29:06,00:29:07,a baby baby.
00:29:07,00:29:08,That's a toy.
00:29:08,00:29:09,"No, you do."
00:29:09,00:29:10,They do exist.
00:29:10,00:29:11,That's incredible.
00:29:11,00:29:12,That's incredible.
00:29:12,00:29:13,It is incredible.
00:29:13,00:29:17,I think why it's notable is that this is not just any ordinary pearl.
00:29:17,00:29:19,It's not just that it was the world largest at the time.
00:29:19,00:29:21,This is La Peregrina.
00:29:21,00:29:22,Yeah.
00:29:22,00:29:23,I said that.
00:29:23,00:29:24,This is the wonderer.
00:29:24,00:29:28,This is a pearl that has been part of so much history.
00:29:28,00:29:31,You can see it in the portraits of Mary Tudor.
00:29:31,00:29:33,She was wearing this pearl.
00:29:33,00:29:37,It made it all all the way into the modern day to Elizabeth Taylor who wore it in two movies.
00:29:37,00:29:39,It's just had this amazing history.
00:29:39,00:29:41,The idea that you could lose this at all.
00:29:41,00:29:42,I know.
00:29:42,00:29:48,"Just to say on Elizabeth Taylor, she got given it by Richard Burton, her husband a couple"
00:29:48,00:29:49,of times.
00:29:49,00:29:57,And she lost it in a dog's mouth again momentarily and the pearl was the same size on both
00:29:57,00:29:58,occasions.
00:29:58,00:30:04,"But yeah, she lost it and she was really worried because this was a very iconic piece of"
00:30:04,00:30:05,jewelry.
00:30:05,00:30:09,And she looked in her dog's mouth and there it was extraordinary.
00:30:09,00:30:10,So pearls.
00:30:10,00:30:11,"Oh, yeah."
00:30:11,00:30:12,Famous pearls.
00:30:12,00:30:13,This one's called La Peregrina.
00:30:13,00:30:14,Right?
00:30:14,00:30:15,Yeah.
00:30:15,00:30:20,It's another incredibly famous pearl called La Peregrina.
00:30:20,00:30:21,Oh my gosh.
00:30:21,00:30:22,No.
00:30:22,00:30:23,It's so weird.
00:30:23,00:30:24,And this one is also one of the most storied pearls.
00:30:24,00:30:29,"This one's been through France, maybe Louis XVI, it was involved in the October revolution"
00:30:29,00:30:31,"in Russia, not in a key role."
00:30:31,00:30:32,What is that?
00:30:32,00:30:33,La Grina mean.
00:30:33,00:30:36,"Because Peregrina means a female pilgrim presumed, isn't it?"
00:30:36,00:30:39,"Peregrina is the wandering one, isn't it?"
00:30:39,00:30:40,Yeah.
00:30:40,00:30:41,And I don't wonder.
00:30:41,00:30:42,La Peregrina.
00:30:42,00:30:44,I haven't actually written down the meaning of it.
00:30:44,00:30:45,I don't know.
00:30:45,00:30:46,"Isn't it bottled water, isn't it?"
00:30:46,00:30:47,"Peregrina, isn't it?"
00:30:47,00:30:49,It's a female bottled water.
00:30:49,00:30:50,That's it.
00:30:50,00:30:51,That's it.
00:30:51,00:30:52,Yeah.
00:30:52,00:30:57,So you know how mollusks of all sorts make pearls.
00:30:57,00:30:58,Yeah.
00:30:58,00:30:59,"A lot of all sorts, a few specific sorts."
00:30:59,00:31:04,So what is it like they get a bit of grit in them and they put something around it or
00:31:04,00:31:05,something?
00:31:05,00:31:06,Yeah.
00:31:06,00:31:10,The main idea is that pearls form around a grain of sand or a bit of grit.
00:31:10,00:31:16,"In fact, it's almost always a parasitic worm that gets inside the muscle or the oyster"
00:31:16,00:31:17,or whatever.
00:31:17,00:31:18,I know.
00:31:18,00:31:20,And they just coat it in the sticky stuff and then they keep on coating.
00:31:20,00:31:23,And that's how pearl develops.
00:31:23,00:31:26,But this is the amazing thing about how mollusks make them.
00:31:26,00:31:32,They can moderate the thickness of the layers that they produce.
00:31:32,00:31:33,I find this really weird.
00:31:33,00:31:38,"If a layer of a pearl is a bit thick on one side, the next layer will be thinner on that"
00:31:38,00:31:39,one side in response.
00:31:39,00:31:42,"Oh, that's why they're pure circles."
00:31:42,00:31:47,"That's why they're perfectly round, is because they're constantly balancing out to make"
00:31:47,00:31:48,it so I know.
00:31:48,00:31:53,And that this was studied by scientists who cut pearls with a diamond wire saw and then
00:31:53,00:31:57,polished them and counted the layers and measured the thickness of all the layers.
00:31:57,00:31:58,That's really cool.
00:31:58,00:31:59,It's really craft.
00:31:59,00:32:00,They're actually crafty.
00:32:00,00:32:01,"Yeah, yeah."
00:32:01,00:32:02,That's really beautiful.
00:32:02,00:32:05,"You know what, the oysters that you get pearls in are not the same as the oysters that"
00:32:05,00:32:06,you eat.
00:32:06,00:32:07,Is that so?
00:32:07,00:32:08,Yeah.
00:32:08,00:32:09,They're different species.
00:32:09,00:32:13,"They're in the same family, but that's as closely as they're related."
00:32:13,00:32:18,So the eater oysters are in Australia dye and the pearl oysters are in their terry dye.
00:32:18,00:32:23,"I thought when you said the eating oysters, I thought very upper-class oysters were very"
00:32:23,00:32:24,well-educated.
00:32:24,00:32:32,So those two types of oysters are less closely related to each other than we are to the world's
00:32:32,00:32:33,smallest monkey.
00:32:33,00:32:40,"So while these say the appearance of the world's smallest monkey, he's the size of a pearl"
00:32:40,00:32:41,now.
00:32:41,00:32:44,It's the size of the world's biggest pearl.
00:32:44,00:32:46,"At the time, which actually is not the world's biggest pearl anymore."
00:32:46,00:32:47,"No, no, absolutely."
00:32:47,00:32:52,"The world's biggest pearl is the gigapurl, which was discovered in the Philippines, and is"
00:32:52,00:32:54,I'd say that one.
00:32:54,00:32:55,Don't know.
00:32:55,00:32:56,Yeah.
00:32:56,00:33:00,"It's 27, just over 27 kilos and it's the size of a female chimp."
00:33:00,00:33:02,That's a hell of a jump from 11 grams.
00:33:02,00:33:03,Yeah.
00:33:03,00:33:04,27 kilos.
00:33:04,00:33:06,But it's not like a really beautiful one.
00:33:06,00:33:07,"It looks kind of a bit ugly, doesn't it?"
00:33:07,00:33:09,But it's not a perfect round pearl.
00:33:09,00:33:10,"No, no, no."
00:33:10,00:33:12,It looks a bit like a monkey brain.
00:33:12,00:33:13,I think I saw a picture of it.
00:33:13,00:33:14,Yeah.
00:33:14,00:33:15,It looks a bit.
00:33:15,00:33:19,We didn't know we had it for a long time because this Filipino man who owned it just kept
00:33:19,00:33:20,it under his bed.
00:33:20,00:33:21,He didn't know what it was.
00:33:21,00:33:25,He had it for 10 years and eventually he just had to get it out of the house.
00:33:25,00:33:28,"If James's fact would be a lot more interesting, the pearl was lost for 10 years down the"
00:33:28,00:33:32,"back of his sofa, then we could have paid attention."
00:33:32,00:33:35,I think that interest me is James.
00:33:35,00:33:40,"The thing that interest me is value, all right, so why do we decide that pearls are valuable?"
00:33:40,00:33:45,"So for example Mark Twain's great quote, ""I wonder how much people would pay for a soap"
00:33:45,00:33:50,"bubble, if there's only one in the world that wonderful iridescence you get on bubbles."""
00:33:50,00:33:56,"And in some cultures, mother of pearl, that marvellous thing you get inside the shell"
00:33:56,00:33:58,is more valuable than the pearl themselves.
00:33:58,00:34:02,The Japanese divers used to throw away the pearls because they're collecting the mother of
00:34:02,00:34:03,pearl.
00:34:03,00:34:10,"And yet, according to Suetonius, the Roman historian, the main reason Julius Caesar invaded"
00:34:10,00:34:12,"Britain, do you know what it was?"
00:34:12,00:34:19,"It wasn't tin or leather, I think it was because I had the biggest supply of freshwater pearls"
00:34:19,00:34:20,in mussels.
00:34:20,00:34:21,Really?
00:34:21,00:34:22,Do we still have pearls?
00:34:22,00:34:23,The biggest in Europe.
00:34:23,00:34:27,"I've been to a pearl farm in the UK somewhere, I'm sure, maybe it was in the Isle of White"
00:34:27,00:34:28,or somewhere.
00:34:28,00:34:29,Right.
00:34:29,00:34:30,But do we make pearls in this country?
00:34:30,00:34:31,We do.
00:34:31,00:34:32,I don't know.
00:34:32,00:34:36,"There aren't any pearl factories, I think, but freshwater pearl mussels are a big deal."
00:34:36,00:34:37,Okay.
00:34:37,00:34:40,"And they're being re-bred and re-introduced, and they're more common in Scotland because"
00:34:40,00:34:44,"the waters just lock cleaner up there, basically, and the mussels can survive."
00:34:44,00:34:46,"But yeah, you get British pearls."
00:34:46,00:34:47,Right.
00:34:47,00:34:48,"And in fact, they're incredibly weird."
00:34:48,00:34:51,They release millions of larvae into the water.
00:34:51,00:34:52,That's how they breathe.
00:34:52,00:34:53,It's called a sperm cast.
00:34:53,00:34:54,Yep.
00:34:54,00:35:00,"Which is something else around, yeah, yeah."
00:35:00,00:35:04,And then they hope to get themselves swallowed by a passing salmon.
00:35:04,00:35:07,"This is their tactic, or this is their life cycle, basically."
00:35:07,00:35:11,"They spend a year living on the gills of this salmon or a brown trout, and then they drop"
00:35:11,00:35:15,"off the gills after a year and they burrow into the riverbed, and they can live in a riverbed"
00:35:15,00:35:16,for 130 years.
00:35:16,00:35:17,What?
00:35:17,00:35:18,Wow.
00:35:18,00:35:19,There will be some.
00:35:19,00:35:20,Wow.
00:35:20,00:35:26,"There could be pearls in the UK, which remember Queen Victoria, or which were around in the"
00:35:26,00:35:27,time of Queen Victoria.
00:35:27,00:35:28,Yes.
00:35:28,00:35:29,That's crazy.
00:35:29,00:35:30,That's very nice.
00:35:30,00:35:34,"Well, they might remember, then, if they remember that time, we were talking about the"
00:35:34,00:35:39,"fact that this pearl was lost at Windsor Castle, but something was also lost in a sofa"
00:35:39,00:35:45,"in Buckingham Palace, while Queen Victoria was Queen, and that was a 14-year-old boy of"
00:35:45,00:35:46,Palace.
00:35:46,00:35:47,Yeah.
00:35:47,00:35:48,They just lost the boy.
00:35:48,00:35:51,"Yeah, for a momentarily off for a hundred and a half years."
00:35:51,00:35:54,Was he larger or smaller than the world's smallest monkey?
00:35:54,00:35:55,He was called Boy Jones.
00:35:55,00:35:56,He's quite famous.
00:35:56,00:35:57,Edward Jones.
00:35:57,00:36:01,"He was the first ever celebrity stalker, broke into Buckingham Palace multiple times, sat"
00:36:01,00:36:05,"on the edge of a bed once, took her underwear, boy Jones."
00:36:05,00:36:06,"Oh, boy Jones."
00:36:06,00:36:09,"Yeah, he hid under a sofa at that point."
00:36:09,00:36:10,Was he actually a boy?
00:36:10,00:36:11,Yeah.
00:36:11,00:36:12,"Yeah, it was 14."
00:36:12,00:36:13,"Yeah, 14."
00:36:13,00:36:16,I don't think he was taking the underwear because he was a pervert.
00:36:16,00:36:19,"I think he was just wanting to show that he would, he'd been there."
00:36:19,00:36:22,"Well, he was a 14-year-old boy, so it was probably a bit of a pervert."
00:36:22,00:36:25,It's all like all 14-year-old boys.
00:36:25,00:36:26,Yeah.
00:36:26,00:36:29,"Tell me if I'm wrong about this, but I think they caught him, and then they let him go,"
00:36:29,00:36:32,"and then they caught him again, and then they sent him to Australia."
00:36:32,00:36:34,"Yeah, they were like, ""Okay, you've broken in twice."
00:36:34,00:36:37,"Where can we put you that will just make it that slight bit more hard?"""
00:36:37,00:36:38,Yeah.
00:36:38,00:36:39,To get in Australia.
00:36:39,00:36:40,Wow.
00:36:40,00:36:41,Do we know what he did in Australia?
00:36:41,00:36:42,Did he?
00:36:42,00:36:43,I think he dishears from history.
00:36:43,00:36:44,Right.
00:36:44,00:36:46,"Yeah, I think if memory serves."
00:36:46,00:36:50,"I think he took the underwear with him, and he opened a brand of shops called Victoria's"
00:36:50,00:36:51,Secrets.
00:36:51,00:36:52,Beautiful.
00:36:52,00:36:53,Beautiful.
00:36:53,00:36:59,"I, you say the world's largest pearl, I researched the world's largest things."
00:36:59,00:37:00,Okay.
00:37:00,00:37:05,So the Kuku in the world's largest Kuku clock weighs 23 and a half stone.
00:37:05,00:37:06,Wow.
00:37:06,00:37:07,Wow.
00:37:07,00:37:08,Okay.
00:37:08,00:37:14,"The world's largest container ship can carry 4,282,600 mattresses."
00:37:14,00:37:17,"Oh, but how many mumsets?"
00:37:17,00:37:21,That's what we all really want to set.
00:37:21,00:37:30,"And in 2018, in protest at losing access to the sea after a war with Chilean 1884, Bolivia"
00:37:30,00:37:32,displayed the world's largest flag.
00:37:32,00:37:34,Do you know how big it is?
00:37:34,00:37:38,It's three meters wide and 200 kilometers long.
00:37:38,00:37:39,"Sorry, yes, I did."
00:37:39,00:37:42,"No, we're just going to continue with that quiz from Biffle."
00:37:42,00:37:44,Down another point to James.
00:37:44,00:37:48,You were killing this one.
00:37:48,00:37:55,"Okay, it's time for our final fact of the show, and that is John."
00:37:55,00:38:04,"Okay, my fact is, for a shipworm, the most nutritious part of an ice lolly is the stick."
00:38:04,00:38:07,The perfect companion for a day of the beach.
00:38:07,00:38:08,Yes.
00:38:08,00:38:09,"You have the lolly there, the stick."
00:38:09,00:38:10,It's like Jack Spratt had his wife.
00:38:10,00:38:11,Yes.
00:38:11,00:38:14,"Now, you obviously all know what a shipworm is."
00:38:14,00:38:19,"I'm guessing, but for people who don't know, shipworms are not worms."
00:38:19,00:38:20,Yeah.
00:38:20,00:38:23,They are a kind of clam.
00:38:23,00:38:29,"And unlike normal clams, or mussels or oysters, you know, reference the pearls, they don't"
00:38:29,00:38:30,have a proper shell.
00:38:30,00:38:36,They're shells have evolved to slide off down the body and become a sort of amazing little
00:38:36,00:38:42,"jaw thing, like a little hat, like a little helmet, but covered with lots of tiny teeth."
00:38:42,00:38:47,"And they use these to bore into, they start as tiny larvae as thin as a needle, and they"
00:38:47,00:38:54,bore into ships and wolves and peers and that kind of thing and destroy them by honeycombing
00:38:54,00:38:55,them.
00:38:55,00:38:56,Wow.
00:38:56,00:39:00,They're the bane of mariners and semen and sailors since forever.
00:39:00,00:39:01,"I mean, they're the most extraordinary thing."
00:39:01,00:39:04,"They've altered modern history, haven't they?"
00:39:04,00:39:05,Yeah.
00:39:05,00:39:08,"Like, basically, they have transformed the world we live in."
00:39:08,00:39:12,"They're known as the termites of the sea, such an invasive problem."
00:39:12,00:39:14,There's something mystical and magical about these things.
00:39:14,00:39:18,There's a shipworm in every historical event that's on water.
00:39:18,00:39:24,"So in 1503, shipworms honeycomb the hulls of Columbus' ships on his fourth voyage, two"
00:39:24,00:39:27,"of them sank and had to be abandoned, and the other two, they just managed to get to"
00:39:27,00:39:30,Jamaica where they were considered unsee-way.
00:39:30,00:39:33,"They were trapped there for a whole year, all of Columbus' men."
00:39:33,00:39:39,"In 1580, when Francis Drake reached London after circumnavigating the globe, the golden"
00:39:39,00:39:43,hind was rotten and spongy from shipworm and never sailed again.
00:39:43,00:39:49,"On James Cook's first voyage, his ship, HMS, and there was so badly damaged by shipworm,"
00:39:49,00:39:52,it had to be hauled onto land and repaired three times.
00:39:52,00:39:53,It just goes on.
00:39:53,00:39:57,Shipworms helped England defeat the Spanish Armada for Christ's sake.
00:39:57,00:39:58,Really?
00:39:58,00:39:59,Yes.
00:39:59,00:40:00,Yeah.
00:40:00,00:40:02,"Because the Spanish ships were much bigger and more powerful, but the shipworms made them"
00:40:02,00:40:05,weak and so cannibals would go straight through this rotten wood.
00:40:05,00:40:06,Right.
00:40:06,00:40:07,That's very cool.
00:40:07,00:40:09,"I mean, the cannibals had something to do with it."
00:40:09,00:40:10,Yeah.
00:40:10,00:40:11,"I mean, that's, yeah."
00:40:11,00:40:15,"Their point of origin isn't even known, really, because they've just been spread worldwide"
00:40:15,00:40:16,by boats.
00:40:16,00:40:17,So any time a ship takes it somewhere.
00:40:17,00:40:19,"Cryptogenesis, like, you know, the cryptid factor."
00:40:19,00:40:20,That's what it's called.
00:40:20,00:40:21,"Oh, really?"
00:40:21,00:40:24,"If you don't know where something's from, it's called cryptogenesis."
00:40:24,00:40:25,Right.
00:40:25,00:40:28,Or knows where the cryptid factor came from.
00:40:28,00:40:31,Or where it's going.
00:40:31,00:40:36,"Wikipedia is very, I'd say, is very horny for shipworms."
00:40:36,00:40:40,"It describes them as a group of saltwater clams with long, soft, naked bodies."
00:40:40,00:40:41,Wow.
00:40:41,00:40:42,Wow.
00:40:42,00:40:43,Wow.
00:40:43,00:40:44,"It's quite something, isn't it?"
00:40:44,00:40:45,Yeah.
00:40:45,00:40:46,"You know, we all have naked bodies until we put clothes on."
00:40:46,00:40:47,"Well, that's true."
00:40:47,00:40:51,But are they long and soft?
00:40:51,00:40:56,"This is for sperm cast, Andy."
00:40:56,00:41:00,"Well, I saw a description of, they don't look very nice shipworms."
00:41:00,00:41:05,"It says, a shipworm's head under its little shell helmet looks like a blend of wet lips"
00:41:05,00:41:09,"and diseased intestines, and they have no eyes."
00:41:09,00:41:11,And they breathe through their bottoms.
00:41:11,00:41:15,"I think, if you look like a mixture of wet lips and intestines or whatever it was, it's"
00:41:15,00:41:17,probably good that you don't have any eyes.
00:41:17,00:41:18,That's true.
00:41:18,00:41:23,"Well, also, they don't need to, they're very interesting things biologically, because they"
00:41:23,00:41:28,"don't, I think, have to find a partner, because they all start out male."
00:41:28,00:41:33,"They just live as teenage boys, basically, on ships, burrowing into that."
00:41:33,00:41:35,Then they just steal in queens underwear.
00:41:35,00:41:36,That's it.
00:41:36,00:41:37,Yeah.
00:41:37,00:41:38,I think they just release sperm.
00:41:38,00:41:41,Then they turn female.
00:41:41,00:41:44,"Then they just absorb the sperm that they just release when they were a teenage boy,"
00:41:44,00:41:45,and they use that to mate.
00:41:45,00:41:46,Mmm.
00:41:46,00:41:47,That's easy.
00:41:47,00:41:48,It's an insult stream.
00:41:48,00:41:49,It is.
00:41:49,00:41:50,It absolutely is.
00:41:50,00:41:55,"So, wood eating creatures are called xylophages, as I'm sure you know."
00:41:55,00:41:58,"Now, of course, why do they eat wood?"
00:41:58,00:42:03,"The answer is because wood is mostly made of cellulose, and cellulose get this, is entirely"
00:42:03,00:42:04,made of glucose.
00:42:04,00:42:05,Did you know that?
00:42:05,00:42:06,Oh.
00:42:06,00:42:09,"So, if you can digest wood, it's extremely nutritious."
00:42:09,00:42:11,"I mean, it really is."
00:42:11,00:42:12,Yum.
00:42:12,00:42:16,"That's why a shipworm would love an isolate, but only the stick it would want, because"
00:42:16,00:42:20,there's more glucose in the stick than there is in the lolly.
00:42:20,00:42:21,Wow.
00:42:21,00:42:22,I see.
00:42:22,00:42:25,"And that's why you shouldn't eat the stick of your lolly, because they're actually just very"
00:42:25,00:42:26,sugary.
00:42:26,00:42:27,"Yeah, yeah."
00:42:27,00:42:31,"If you had the right bacteria inside your stomach, you would be able to eat it, right?"
00:42:31,00:42:34,Because it's in all these animals that eat wood.
00:42:34,00:42:37,They have some special bacteria in their stomach that can digest the wood.
00:42:37,00:42:38,Is that right?
00:42:38,00:42:39,"Yes, that's right."
00:42:39,00:42:40,"Yeah, yeah."
00:42:40,00:42:41,"So, why do we not do that?"
00:42:41,00:42:44,"There must be some kind of pill you can take to give you that, like some kind of"
00:42:44,00:42:46,yackel that will give you the wood bacteria.
00:42:46,00:42:47,Yeah.
00:42:47,00:42:48,"Like a bacteria transfer, right?"
00:42:48,00:42:54,I imagine a race of super soldiers who can just eat the wheat forests that the enemy are
00:42:54,00:42:55,hiding in.
00:42:55,00:42:56,Exactly.
00:42:56,00:43:02,"I just want to make the end of a bath very different, doesn't it?"
00:43:02,00:43:06,"I just want to give a shout out for the positive side of shipworms, because obviously they"
00:43:06,00:43:11,"look disgusting and they do all this damage and so on, but you know, one study estimates"
00:43:11,00:43:16,"that shipworms have sunk more ships than pirates, I thought that was rather lovely."
00:43:16,00:43:19,"But they also do good things, and there's nothing good or bad in the universe."
00:43:19,00:43:23,"It's just, it depends which angle you're coming from."
00:43:23,00:43:27,"So for example, they're responsible of cleaning up more driftwood in the world than anything"
00:43:27,00:43:29,else.
00:43:29,00:43:34,"And the rotary accents, so the way they drill is that little toothy, helmety thing, rotates"
00:43:34,00:43:36,eight to ten times a minute.
00:43:36,00:43:43,"And this inspired Mark Brunel, Isambard Kingdom Brunel's dad, to invent the rotary tunneling"
00:43:43,00:43:47,"machine that dug the first tunnel under the Thames, and which is still essentially used"
00:43:47,00:43:48,today.
00:43:48,00:43:49,Wow.
00:43:49,00:43:50,That's all to do with shipworms.
00:43:50,00:43:51,So good for them.
00:43:51,00:43:52,Very cool.
00:43:52,00:43:54,And they gave us the industrial revolution.
00:43:54,00:43:55,Did they?
00:43:55,00:43:56,Shipworms.
00:43:56,00:43:57,"So kind of, yes."
00:43:57,00:44:03,"So because Britain needed metal ships to stop the shipworms from burrowing, we had to"
00:44:03,00:44:08,"get lots of metal on what did we have, because Julius Caesar wasn't bothered about it, lots"
00:44:08,00:44:09,of copper.
00:44:09,00:44:13,"And so we had to get at the copper, but it's underground."
00:44:13,00:44:17,"So you need to do lots of mining, and then there's lots of water under the mines."
00:44:17,00:44:19,"You need to get the water out, how do you get the water out?"
00:44:19,00:44:24,"You create engines and Thomas Buchmann created the steam engine to drain mines, because we"
00:44:24,00:44:28,"needed the copper, because we needed it to get rid of shipworms."
00:44:28,00:44:30,And that is essentially what started the industrial revolution.
00:44:30,00:44:31,Amazing.
00:44:31,00:44:32,It's so cool.
00:44:32,00:44:34,Lollie sticks.
00:44:34,00:44:35,Yeah.
00:44:35,00:44:36,"Oh, yeah."
00:44:36,00:44:38,Do you remember when they had jokes on them?
00:44:38,00:44:39,"Oh, yeah."
00:44:39,00:44:40,They're not still.
00:44:40,00:44:45,"No, they got phased out in 1988, do you know why they got phased out?"
00:44:45,00:44:46,I was.
00:44:46,00:44:49,"Because there was a reason that they gave, and then there was the actual reason."
00:44:49,00:44:50,Because of woke.
00:44:50,00:44:51,Because of woke.
00:44:51,00:44:52,In 1988.
00:44:52,00:44:53,Yeah.
00:44:53,00:44:54,Because of early woke.
00:44:54,00:44:55,What?
00:44:55,00:44:56,Why?
00:44:56,00:44:59,What was the reason they gave out of date jokes?
00:44:59,00:45:01,"Oh, that come on."
00:45:01,00:45:04,"In Britain, the land of the cracker."
00:45:04,00:45:07,The land of the cracker.
00:45:07,00:45:08,I would it.
00:45:08,00:45:09,OK.
00:45:09,00:45:10,I'm going to give you that.
00:45:10,00:45:15,"The official reason was that people had more sophisticated tastes than to, I mean, they're"
00:45:15,00:45:17,"selling these to children, right?"
00:45:17,00:45:18,Yeah.
00:45:18,00:45:19,So just get what joke tastes?
00:45:19,00:45:20,"Yeah, yeah."
00:45:20,00:45:22,"What do they want, like lengthy observational stuff on the thing?"
00:45:22,00:45:23,Just stupidly sense.
00:45:23,00:45:31,But the actual reason is because they were selling them abroad.
00:45:31,00:45:33,So you had a big batch of ice lollies that you made.
00:45:33,00:45:34,Right.
00:45:34,00:45:36,And they wouldn't all be sold in English-speaking countries.
00:45:36,00:45:41,"So there's no point putting English jokes on there, because 50% of them would be in Spain"
00:45:41,00:45:42,"off of France, Hollywood."
00:45:42,00:45:43,Yes.
00:45:43,00:45:44,Such a shame.
00:45:44,00:45:47,I remember having jokes on my lollies today.
00:45:47,00:45:48,"Yeah, sure."
00:45:48,00:45:49,I don't remember that.
00:45:49,00:45:50,But I was born in 1987.
00:45:50,00:45:53,"So I would have, I kind of been having them when I was a year old."
00:45:53,00:45:56,"Well, they occasionally bring them back for a very short amount of time."
00:45:56,00:46:02,"I think in 2012, Wolves did a thing where they asked a lot of people to send in jokes that"
00:46:02,00:46:05,they were going to print on the sticks and maybe for six months they did it.
00:46:05,00:46:06,Right.
00:46:06,00:46:07,Yeah.
00:46:07,00:46:08,So it comes in and out.
00:46:08,00:46:10,"But generally speaking, they got phased out in '88."
00:46:10,00:46:11,Damn.
00:46:11,00:46:13,I've some ice lollies stuff.
00:46:13,00:46:15,Did you know that it was invented in Churin?
00:46:15,00:46:16,What's it?
00:46:16,00:46:17,Yes.
00:46:17,00:46:21,"Along with Vermouth, Nutella and Ferro Roche, all invented in Churin."
00:46:21,00:46:26,"In 1937, the chock ice, that was the first, the original ice lollies."
00:46:26,00:46:30,"It was a good year for sweeties, actually, in 1937 because Maltese's, pop its smarties and"
00:46:30,00:46:33,rolos were all invented in the same year.
00:46:33,00:46:34,Isn't that strange?
00:46:34,00:46:37,What was that sort of nexus of sweet inventions?
00:46:37,00:46:40,They must have just invented a lot of the machinery.
00:46:40,00:46:43,The Canberian explosion.
00:46:43,00:46:44,The Canberian explosion.
00:46:44,00:46:45,Really good.
00:46:45,00:46:46,Yeah.
00:46:46,00:46:47,"Also, you mentioned."
00:46:47,00:46:48,So close to being a joke like that.
00:46:48,00:46:49,Almost.
00:46:49,00:46:51,"No, I really like it."
00:46:51,00:46:52,The Canberian explosion.
00:46:52,00:46:53,The Canberian explosion.
00:46:53,00:46:54,The Canberian explosion.
00:46:54,00:46:55,The Canberian explosion.
00:46:55,00:46:56,The Canberian explosion.
00:46:56,00:46:57,"Yeah, it doesn't work."
00:46:57,00:46:58,It's so close to a joke.
00:46:58,00:46:59,It's very close to a joke.
00:46:59,00:47:00,That's my radio show.
00:47:00,00:47:02,Welcome to a very close to a joke.
00:47:02,00:47:06,"So, shall we talk about what we're talking about eating things?"
00:47:06,00:47:08,I think people eat shipworms.
00:47:08,00:47:09,Yeah.
00:47:09,00:47:10,Some places.
00:47:10,00:47:11,Do they?
00:47:11,00:47:12,Yeah.
00:47:12,00:47:13,Okay.
00:47:13,00:47:14,"They don't look nice, but they are delicious."
00:47:14,00:47:17,And they are also incredibly nutritious.
00:47:17,00:47:22,"Shipworms have more protein than beef, as well as being rich in iron, zinc, selenium and"
00:47:22,00:47:24,vitamin B12.
00:47:24,00:47:27,"And you said Dan, they're called sometimes the termites of the sea."
00:47:27,00:47:28,Yes.
00:47:28,00:47:33,And a termite contains twice as much protein as solo in steak.
00:47:33,00:47:34,They're...
00:47:34,00:47:37,"I'm not going to say taking it off, but I think the world's first modern shipworm farm"
00:47:37,00:47:43,was founded a couple of years ago because they convert Borealwood to very edible protein.
00:47:43,00:47:49,"But they're so brilliant, because if you're farming salmon, for example, in order for the"
00:47:49,00:47:53,"salmon to have something to do, you've got to collect four times as many tiny fish for"
00:47:53,00:47:54,this.
00:47:54,00:47:59,"This is ecologically incredibly damaging fish farming, whereas you just chuck a crappy old"
00:47:59,00:48:06,"log of driftwood into the thing and shipworms eat that, and it's incredibly effective environmentally."
00:48:06,00:48:07,Yeah.
00:48:07,00:48:08,"They grow really fast, as well."
00:48:08,00:48:09,And they grow.
00:48:09,00:48:10,The shipworms grow.
00:48:10,00:48:11,What is it?
00:48:11,00:48:12,20 times as fast as muscles.
00:48:12,00:48:14,"Which, obviously, we all like."
00:48:14,00:48:15,Are we eating shipworm food then?
00:48:15,00:48:16,Is it out there?
00:48:16,00:48:17,"Not yet, but it is."
00:48:17,00:48:25,"These two guys at Cambridge, David Willer and Bizarrelli, a guy called Ruben Shipway, started"
00:48:25,00:48:29,"the thing called the naked clam project, because, as Andy said, they're sort of naked because"
00:48:29,00:48:31,they don't have a shell.
00:48:31,00:48:35,"And they reckon this is going to solve world malnutrition, because not only they're very"
00:48:35,00:48:38,"nutritious, they're environmentally safe."
00:48:38,00:48:42,"And they've got this amazing thing is, in the tanks where these shipworms nibbling on the"
00:48:42,00:48:47,"driftwood, they chuck in a few garlic capsules as well, so that you get ready garlic clam."
00:48:47,00:48:48,"Oh, my God."
00:48:48,00:48:49,You know what?
00:48:49,00:48:53,"Next to my house, not far from my house, there was a restaurant opened where all the food"
00:48:53,00:48:55,was made out of insects.
00:48:55,00:48:56,"Oh, yeah?"
00:48:56,00:48:57,"In the last, this was in the last year."
00:48:57,00:48:58,Wow.
00:48:58,00:49:01,"It lasted about three months, because people do not want to eat that shit."
00:49:01,00:49:02,"Oh, I'm sorry."
00:49:02,00:49:03,You must have gone presumably.
00:49:03,00:49:04,I wanted to.
00:49:04,00:49:08,"And then by the time I tried to buck it, it was already closed down."
00:49:08,00:49:09,But you wonder why not?
00:49:09,00:49:16,"I mean, one of the many xylophages, along with beavers and woodworm, death watch, beetle,"
00:49:16,00:49:19,"is woodlice, which are wood-eating things."
00:49:19,00:49:25,"And they are closely related to the, they're not insects, they're crustaceans, and we don't"
00:49:25,00:49:28,"have a problem eating clams or lobsters, but woodlice."
00:49:28,00:49:32,"Well, it's because it's got louse, lice in the title, but the same with shipworms."
00:49:32,00:49:34,"If you call them shipworms, people aren't going to want to eat them."
00:49:34,00:49:38,"If you call them long oyster, yum, yum, yum."
00:49:38,00:49:43,"Oh, was that thing a scoffier went, a scoffier first one to serve frog's legs."
00:49:43,00:49:45,He called them nymphs of the dawn.
00:49:45,00:49:46,Brilliant.
00:49:46,00:49:48,But we can come up with a good name for shipworms.
00:49:48,00:49:49,We can get in on this.
00:49:49,00:49:53,"When naked clams doesn't do it for me, when one, that doesn't sound, long, soft naked."
00:49:53,00:49:54,Yeah.
00:49:54,00:49:55,Black bodies.
00:49:55,00:49:56,Chocolate willies.
00:49:56,00:49:57,Try more of that.
00:49:57,00:49:58,No.
00:49:58,00:50:01,They already exist.
00:50:01,00:50:02,One shipworm we haven't mentioned.
00:50:02,00:50:03,"Oh, yeah."
00:50:03,00:50:04,Giant shipworm.
00:50:04,00:50:07,"Oh, yes, we must have that in."
00:50:07,00:50:09,Kufus polythalamia.
00:50:09,00:50:13,"It was legendary for a long time, Dan, right up the hill straight."
00:50:13,00:50:14,"Oh, yeah."
00:50:14,00:50:17,"And it doesn't live in the sea, so it's a related species, because there are loads of different"
00:50:17,00:50:18,species of species.
00:50:18,00:50:19,Yes.
00:50:19,00:50:21,"And we've mostly been talking about the one that eats ships, which is one specific species"
00:50:21,00:50:22,of shipworm.
00:50:22,00:50:26,"This one lives in mud, and it doesn't barrel into wood."
00:50:26,00:50:31,"It builds this chalky case around itself, and it can get up to five feet long."
00:50:31,00:50:32,Wow.
00:50:32,00:50:33,It's so big.
00:50:33,00:50:36,It's the same size as Nicki Minaj.
00:50:36,00:50:37,Nicki Minaj.
00:50:37,00:50:43,And 40 times longer than the smallest monkey with a sofa.
00:50:43,00:50:49,"But you said Dan, most shipworms are eight to 18 inches long, and this can be five, six"
00:50:49,00:50:50,feet long.
00:50:50,00:50:51,But it doesn't eat wood.
00:50:51,00:50:53,That's the weird thing about this shipworm.
00:50:53,00:50:54,"Yeah, it's bizarre."
00:50:54,00:50:57,"But basically, it was a team of scientists who found one, and they found it because someone"
00:50:57,00:51:00,in the Philippines had taken a film of it on YouTube.
00:51:00,00:51:03,"They'd been searching for it for ages without success, and then someone found it"
00:51:03,00:51:05,"on YouTube, basically."
00:51:05,00:51:10,"But you can see them pouring it out of its shell or whatever it is, and it's absolutely"
00:51:10,00:51:11,disgusting.
