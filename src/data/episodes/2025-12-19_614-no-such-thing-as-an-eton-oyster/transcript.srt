1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:02,600
 Merry Christmas, everyone!

2
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:03,840
 Oh, ho, ho!

3
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:04,600
 Yep.

4
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:05,880
 [laughter]

5
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:06,640
 Thanks, Ben.

6
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:09,640
 Well, as you can see, we are all in the Christmas spirit,

7
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:13,600
 and why would we not be because we have a very special guest for you here today?

8
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:18,040
 That's right. It is the man known as the chief gnome of the QI operation.

9
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:21,720
 He is the person who brought us four, including Anna together,

10
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:23,960
 to make no such thing as a fish. It is John Lloyd.

11
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:27,360
 Yes, the Christ figure to our three wise men.

12
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:28,320
 Oh, my God.

13
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:29,840
 Okay. Okay, no.

14
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:31,720
 I'm, I'm, I'm rowing back.

15
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:33,880
 He's, uh, he's the producer of QI.

16
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:36,560
 He's the producer of every great comedy series you watched.

17
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:39,160
 Black-annish spitting image, not the 9 o'clock news so much.

18
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:42,280
 And he's the author of a book called The Meaning of Liff,

19
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:46,280
 co-written with Douglas Adams 42 years ago.

20
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:48,840
 And it's just been reissued. It's a fantastic book.

21
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:52,840
 Yeah, this book is basically a dictionary of things that they should be words for.

22
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:54,920
 Uh, but they don't exist.

23
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:59,120
 And so, what they've done is there are signs of place names all around the UK

24
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:01,040
 that don't have any meaning attached to them.

25
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:04,160
 And they've attached these observations to those to create new words.

26
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:05,240
 Like bath?

27
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:06,520
 Uh, no.

28
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:08,400
 That means that it already has meaning.

29
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,440
 Oh, yeah. Yeah, sandwich, for example.

30
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:14,400
 That, no, no, you guys are screwing this up.

31
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,800
 Demoins?

32
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:18,840
 The two little lines coming down from your nose to your mouth are the demoins?

33
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:21,400
 Ah, nice. I like ealy. That's always been my favorite.

34
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:25,720
 The first tiniest inkling that's something somewhere has gone terribly wrong.

35
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:27,320
 Okay, so that's the meaning of Liff.

36
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:28,840
 It's available in all shops now.

37
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:33,120
 It's a brilliant Christmas present stocking filler main present, I would say.

38
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:34,120
 Absolutely.

39
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:38,040
 But what if you're listening to this, and it's too late to do the shopping,

40
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:40,840
 and you need to get the fish lover in your life a gift?

41
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:43,720
 What to do is get the fish listener in your life.

42
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:48,240
 Membership of club fish are wonderful, super secret, top secret,

43
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:51,680
 but also crucially accessible to everyone on the planet, members club.

44
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,400
 Absolutely. There's loads of things on there.

45
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:55,280
 There's loads of bonus content.

46
00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:00,320
 There is going to be a super special quiz coming up in the new year that we're going to announce.

47
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:03,480
 There are extra long versions of our normal episode.

48
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:08,320
 There is video episodes of Drop Us Align, which is our audience feedback show.

49
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:12,240
 Go to patreon.com/no such thing as a fish, and you can get your membership there.

50
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:16,640
 But in the meantime, please enjoy this episode of No Such Thing as a Fish

51
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:19,640
 with John Lloyd, C-B-E.

52
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:22,160
 Christ of the British Empire.

53
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,400
 On with the show.

54
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:44,240
 Hello, and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming

55
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:47,240
 to you from the QI offices in Hobern.

56
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,240
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

57
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:53,480
 I am sitting here with James Harkin, Andrew Hunter Murray, and John Lloyd.

58
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:57,440
 Once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven

59
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:01,600
 days, and in a particular order, here we go.

60
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:04,080
 Starting with fact number one, and that is Andy.

61
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:09,120
 My fact is, the Chicago River used to be sparkling, but only because of all the animal

62
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:14,120
 carcasses floating in it.

63
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:17,680
 How did dead carcasses make something fizzy?

64
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,560
 Well, they give off methane.

65
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,000
 They give off gas.

66
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:27,440
 Basically, there's a bit of the Chicago River, which was called bubbly creek.

67
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:31,760
 This is actually a good news story from this year, because finally they've cleaned it up.

68
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:35,360
 But a hundred years ago, it was really foul.

69
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,560
 It was amazing.

70
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:42,160
 So there's a bit of the Chicago River, which has been full of junk for a century, and

71
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:46,920
 the reason that it was so bad in that particular bit was because it's next to the Abattoir

72
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:53,960
 District, the slaughterhouses, all of that, and it was so foul that bits of it were just

73
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:54,960
 solid at the surface.

74
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:58,120
 The river was just caked with lumps of matter.

75
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,120
 Oh, wow.

76
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,120
 So you don't need a bridge?

77
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,120
 No bridge required.

78
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,120
 No, no, no.

79
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,120
 Exactly.

80
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,120
 Really good.

81
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,120
 Chickens could walk on it.

82
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,120
 Could they?

83
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,120
 Completely unharmed.

84
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,120
 Who just wander out of this?

85
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:11,320
 Chickens can swim, so that doesn't really help them that much, can't they?

86
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:12,320
 They can.

87
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:13,320
 They are my thinking of ducks.

88
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,320
 You think of ducks?

89
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,320
 Yeah.

90
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:22,280
 That's because the reason there were so many carcasses in it is because from 1865 to the 1920s,

91
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:25,560
 more meat was processed in Chicago than anywhere else in the world.

92
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,560
 No.

93
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,560
 Really?

94
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,560
 Wow.

95
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,560
 And it's a big foodie place.

96
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:32,000
 I was interested in other kinds of food in Chicago.

97
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,400
 Did you know Shredded Wheat was invented in Chicago?

98
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,400
 No.

99
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:39,000
 It's premiered at the world's Farron Chicago in 1893 and invented by Henry Perkey.

100
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
 Yeah.

101
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
 Okay.

102
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:49,000
 And also 31% of children admitted to the University of Chicago Burn Centre over a 10-year period

103
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,760
 were scalded by instant noodles.

104
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:51,760
 Oh, wow.

105
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:52,760
 Wow.

106
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:53,760
 I've been there.

107
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:54,760
 To that centre.

108
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:55,760
 No.

109
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:58,680
 To the world of scalded hot noodles.

110
00:04:58,680 --> 00:04:59,680
 Ah.

111
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,680
 Situations.

112
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:01,680
 Yeah.

113
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:02,680
 You've got to let those noodles stand.

114
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:03,680
 Gotta get to them.

115
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:04,680
 Gotta get straighter to them.

116
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:08,800
 This, you say sparkling, it didn't look nice, did it, right?

117
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,720
 The bubbles were purely the sparkly elements.

118
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:11,720
 Yes, it did.

119
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:12,720
 I'd say rather than sparkling.

120
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:16,160
 Because I've got some sparkling water here in front of me, it's beautiful and clear.

121
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,160
 Oh, that's lovely.

122
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,160
 Yeah, yeah.

123
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:21,720
 I put a dead mouse in here before we started just to help it bubble.

124
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:27,000
 Well, you say, in the bubbly water, though, a liter of bottled water contains an average

125
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,400
 of 240,000 detectable plastic fragments.

126
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,400
 Oh, dear.

127
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:32,400
 Oh, right.

128
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,400
 Don't drink that.

129
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,400
 Don't drink that.

130
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,400
 Here's another one, James.

131
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:39,520
 Well, the bottles can have 40,000 times more bacteria than a toilet seat.

132
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:42,520
 Oh, well, this isn't real useful, but this is one that I'm going to chuck away into the

133
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:43,520
 street afterwards.

134
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,520
 Just that.

135
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:47,000
 I'm going to chuck it into the Thames and see what pops up.

136
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
 Yeah.

137
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
 Can I tell you a thing about bubbles?

138
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
 Yes.

139
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
 Probably water.

140
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
 Okay.

141
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:57,200
 So London has the ability to spritz its own water.

142
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,200
 The Thames?

143
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,200
 The Thames.

144
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:05,720
 It has two boats, the bubble boats, which can inject gas into the river.

145
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:07,120
 Is it just for fun?

146
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,120
 It's not.

147
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:10,840
 It's really important, but it's only occasionally needed, right?

148
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:16,920
 So when there is really hot weather, and when there are sometimes sewage over spills,

149
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:20,240
 which mostly won't happen anymore because of the new Big Thames Tideway tunnel, which we've

150
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,400
 talked about, blah, blah, blah.

151
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:25,680
 But basically, there are times where you just need to inject oxygen into the water so

152
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:26,680
 fish can breathe.

153
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:27,680
 I see.

154
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,800
 So there's a sewage overflow.

155
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:32,640
 That means there's not enough oxygen in there so you need to get some in.

156
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:33,640
 Exactly.

157
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:36,080
 And there are two boats, they're called bubbler and vitality.

158
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,600
 It's an absolute last resort.

159
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:42,300
 You know, if you're using the oxygenate, the water boat, it's a really bad sign, but they

160
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:47,200
 can each inject 30 tons of oxygen into the river every day.

161
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,200
 That's really cool.

162
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:53,000
 This is necessary because in 1957, the Thames was declared biologically dead.

163
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:58,100
 And by 1970, it was so polluted, it has started to dissolve the hulls of boats.

164
00:06:58,100 --> 00:06:59,100
 Wow.

165
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:00,100
 It is that toxic.

166
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:01,100
 Oh my gosh.

167
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:02,100
 Yeah, it's a lot better.

168
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:03,100
 I think it's a lot better out here.

169
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:08,240
 And it's really interesting because the word Thames means river in Celtic.

170
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:14,320
 Same as the word "tine" means river from Old English word "tinan", which means to dissolve.

171
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,320
 Okay.

172
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:16,320
 That's nice.

173
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:21,560
 It's amazing that we can tell how much oxygen is in the Thames.

174
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:24,820
 That's pretty extraordinary that you would take a sample of one spot and that would tell

175
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:27,120
 you the story of the entire Thames.

176
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,120
 Yeah, you're right.

177
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:29,120
 It just seems quite wild.

178
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:32,940
 I had this thing quite recently where they put a little finger on your finger and they

179
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:34,740
 tell you how much oxygen is in your blood.

180
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:35,740
 How the fuck does that work?

181
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:36,740
 Yeah.

182
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:38,640
 Is it because all your blood goes through your finger at some point or another?

183
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:39,640
 No, it can't.

184
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:40,640
 Can it?

185
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:41,640
 Can it?

186
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:42,640
 No, it can't.

187
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:43,640
 I mean, that's not how it works.

188
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:46,140
 No, because some of the blood goes out to your leg and then back to the heart.

189
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:47,140
 Yeah.

190
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:48,140
 You know, it's up to your finger and then back to the heart.

191
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:49,140
 Yeah.

192
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:50,140
 I don't know how it works.

193
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:53,880
 And I don't want to know, actually, because I have to think it's magic.

194
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:54,880
 Okay.

195
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:59,520
 Here's some stuff on corpses and carcasses.

196
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:04,360
 Do you know there's a theory that anthrax can lure you in?

197
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,360
 Oh.

198
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,360
 Yeah.

199
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:10,060
 So the idea is that anthrax gets into an animal.

200
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:11,880
 The animal dies.

201
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:16,660
 And then the animal sort of fertilises the ground and so it gets more lush.

202
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:19,880
 And then that gets more animals to go to it.

203
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:24,200
 And then those animals catch the anthrax and then they die.

204
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:26,920
 And there's an idea that that's how it's evolved.

205
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:27,920
 That's its life cycle.

206
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:28,920
 Isn't that cool?

207
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:29,920
 Yes.

208
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:30,920
 That's very cool.

209
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,800
 It's so weird that that stuff got out.

210
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:38,440
 Well, I guess we've, I make that sound as if it's like the anthrax is going, "Shh, shhh."

211
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:41,480
 Like, you know, I've turned it into a human in my mind.

212
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:45,400
 You know, we have to anthropomorphize a lot of these facts to make them interesting.

213
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,400
 Yeah.

214
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:50,200
 And the other thing that I found is I went to a place called Padarac in France, it's a big

215
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,400
 sort of cave.

216
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:56,000
 And they said that in the 20th century, in some parts of France, there was a law that if

217
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,200
 your animal got diseased and died, you have to go and throw it into the nearest chasm.

218
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,200
 Oh, chasm.

219
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,720
 That's what they called it.

220
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:07,920
 Like, to be further one in Padarac is like a big chasm and they thought the devil lived

221
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:08,920
 down there and stuff.

222
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:12,240
 It was like one of those, you know, it's like a sinkhole kind of...

223
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,240
 Right, right, right.

224
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:17,400
 The problem is that the rivers go underneath these chasms and they're attached to the water

225
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:18,400
 supply.

226
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:22,800
 So you throw in your anthrax cow or sheep and then it gets into the water and people get

227
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:23,800
 sick that way.

228
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:24,800
 No, yeah.

229
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:25,800
 So it was a misguided law.

230
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,800
 Is there so many of them are?

231
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:28,800
 Question.

232
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:29,800
 Yeah.

233
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,280
 What's the difference between a chasm and a gorge?

234
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:32,280
 Oh, well.

235
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:40,800
 I would say that a chasm is caused by a collapse of land to make a hole whereas a gorge

236
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,280
 is caused by a river.

237
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:44,720
 Right, so it's like a huge river.

238
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:48,320
 A river is like almost like a big, shaped valley caused by a fast flowing river.

239
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,320
 Yeah.

240
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,320
 A gorge, sorry.

241
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,320
 A gorge.

242
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,320
 Right, right.

243
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,320
 And a canyon?

244
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,320
 Same.

245
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,320
 Same, but bigger.

246
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,320
 Big river.

247
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,320
 Canyon is an American gorge.

248
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,320
 Big river.

249
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,320
 Do you know what a current bum is?

250
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,320
 A current bum.

251
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:05,760
 A current bum is a rock under the surface of a river, which gives that sort of hump thing.

252
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:06,760
 Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

253
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:07,760
 What is covered in water?

254
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:08,760
 Yeah.

255
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:09,760
 The water goes over a boulder.

256
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:10,760
 Oh, sure.

257
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:12,760
 And how far is that just known?

258
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:13,760
 It's actually called.

259
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,760
 It's a book called Landscape, where Robert McFarlane, which I highly recommend.

260
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:16,760
 Right.

261
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:18,760
 Right, dialect words all over the country.

262
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:19,760
 Very cool.

263
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:20,760
 The river is now clean, Andy.

264
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:21,760
 You said the Chicago River.

265
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:22,760
 Yes.

266
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:25,760
 Except, once a year, it looks like toxic goo.

267
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:26,760
 Oh.

268
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:30,880
 And that's because of some Patrick's day, they die the river, the entire river, green.

269
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:31,880
 Lovely.

270
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:32,880
 Yeah.

271
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:33,880
 Lovely?

272
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:34,880
 Well, I celebrate Irish Heritage Shaves.

273
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:35,880
 I don't know why you don't.

274
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:36,880
 What?

275
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:40,520
 Because I add part Irish.

276
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:41,520
 But I refuse.

277
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:43,640
 I just straight up refuse.

278
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:44,640
 What, I don't know what that is.

279
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:49,640
 Well, I think the question is, is it okay, like, are they putting in toxic goo, or are they

280
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:50,960
 putting in food coloring?

281
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:51,960
 Food coloring.

282
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:55,800
 They started with toxic goo, and that quickly got speed back.

283
00:10:55,800 --> 00:11:01,240
 I think they did, because it started by accident in 1961 when some people were putting

284
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:06,840
 dye into the water to see where like a leak had come out or to see where the water flowed.

285
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:09,000
 And then it was around St. Patrick's Day.

286
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,040
 So everyone thought, oh, they did that on purpose.

287
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:14,680
 And they went, oh, we didn't, but let's do it on purpose in future.

288
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:16,200
 But that dye was toxic.

289
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,200
 Ah.

290
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,200
 There you go.

291
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,200
 That's very funny.

292
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,040
 The Chicago River is a friend of the podcast.

293
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,040
 Yeah.

294
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:23,040
 Also, it is.

295
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:28,440
 Because in 2004, the Dave Matthews band drove over it in their bus and dumped an estimated

296
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:33,680
 800 pounds of human feces onto a passenger sightseeing boat.

297
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:34,680
 Oh.

298
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:35,680
 Yes.

299
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,760
 That's a hundred pounds of feces from their bus.

300
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:40,000
 They've been saving it up.

301
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
 The tour bus.

302
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,720
 That's a hell of a tour.

303
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:43,720
 Was it through a grating?

304
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:44,720
 It was through a grating.

305
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:45,720
 Yeah.

306
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:47,840
 And you imagine being on that boat.

307
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,720
 Celebrity feces all early.

308
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:51,600
 You wouldn't know it was celebrity, though.

309
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,680
 If you knew it's celebrity, that might take the edge off.

310
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:57,120
 Do you think if you saw Dave Matthews waving out the window, you'd go, how lucky are we?

311
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:00,720
 I don't think Dave Matthews is of a level of celebrity enough.

312
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:01,720
 No.

313
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:02,720
 No.

314
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:03,720
 I know his face.

315
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,240
 I'd want it to be a list.

316
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:07,080
 He won't tell the Swiss bus traveling.

317
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:08,480
 Source of, yeah.

318
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,480
 Right.

319
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:12,080
 That's going to be mixed with Travis Kelsey's carcass.

320
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,080
 Too much.

321
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:18,560
 In the meaning of live, the Chicago is defined as the foul smelling wind that precedes

322
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:19,560
 an underground train.

323
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:20,560
 Oh.

324
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:23,600
 Might, of course, be one of Dave Matthews' fans.

325
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:26,320
 But it was known as the Stinking River.

326
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,560
 Wasn't it the Chicago River?

327
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:30,200
 That's what locals called it all the way through the 20th century.

328
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,200
 It was really.

329
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,200
 It sounds like it was so bad.

330
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:36,040
 And a lot of the contemporary descriptions of how awful it was come from this brilliant

331
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:41,440
 book, The Jungle, by a writer called Up to the Sling Claire, who wrote, it was a journalistic

332
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:45,760
 exposé, really, of the slaughterhouses and their practices and just how, you know,

333
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:48,440
 appalling the quality was there.

334
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:51,280
 So I'll just read you a couple of sentences of it.

335
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:56,080
 The material brought to the surface was as black as ink, a considerable amount of gas

336
00:12:56,080 --> 00:13:00,680
 was given off, which was so evil smelling that it could be detected even above the

337
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:03,360
 prevailing odour from the stockyard pens.

338
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,360
 Oh, my God.

339
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:05,360
 I know.

340
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:11,200
 And sometimes the river would catch fire because it was so, wow, and sometimes people would wander

341
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,200
 out.

342
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,200
 I'm presumably chasing your chicken.

343
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,200
 Yeah.

344
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,200
 And you try to get it back.

345
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,200
 And then they just disappear below the surface.

346
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,720
 Could they get out a bit into it?

347
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:21,200
 You mean they could walk over some glove and then disappear at that sense?

348
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,200
 No.

349
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,200
 Up to the Sling Claire.

350
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,200
 Oh, yeah.

351
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,200
 He was known as like a mucker acre.

352
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:29,800
 He wrote fiction that exposed what was going on in society and quite a few laws were

353
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:33,200
 changed off the back of different books that he wrote over the course of his life.

354
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,280
 So he's really important.

355
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:39,600
 But I also have a book of his at my house, which is called Mental Radio.

356
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:44,680
 And it's a book he wrote all about his experiments with telepathy because his wife Mary believed

357
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:46,880
 that she had telepathic abilities.

358
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:51,720
 So we're tell these really awesome people getting a bit woo woo towards the end.

359
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:52,720
 Yeah.

360
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:55,720
 If you look at all these, all the people who invented quantum mechanics, for example,

361
00:13:55,720 --> 00:14:01,800
 became really mystical towards the end of their life because, you know, Schrodinger.

362
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:05,000
 I guess it is kind of like, it's almost like magic, isn't it?

363
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
 Quantum.

364
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
 Yeah, quantum gifts.

365
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
 Quantum gifts.

366
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
 Yeah, I think you go.

367
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,360
 You once you've done a lifetime of science, you think actually, but why, why is there something

368
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:13,360
 and not nothing?

369
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:17,320
 Because I've got a friend who was a Nobel Prize winner called Brian Josephson who invented

370
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:19,000
 the Josephson Junction.

371
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
 Oh, yeah.

372
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:25,600
 So it's a super-knocked guy who is basically slightly sent to Coventry in Cambridge because

373
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:30,200
 he's become a Buddhist and become very spiritual and he's the most wonderful person.

374
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:34,000
 I think in the University of Cambridge, they don't say sent to Coventry, they say sent

375
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,080
 to the University of Warwick.

376
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:40,400
 That's very, Schrodinger, but yeah, Albert Einstein wrote it forward to the German edition

377
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:42,280
 of Mental Radio, so even he was interested in it.

378
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:44,760
 Yeah, so who often, Sinclair, was a very interesting character.

379
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:47,440
 Sounds like a good, it's a good name for a radio station.

380
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,320
 Welcome to Mental Radio.

381
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:53,080
 It's no music, it's just Prince.

382
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:54,080
 That's it.

383
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:56,520
 Steve Pank, Walter Walls, Steve Pank.

384
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:59,640
 But the thing about celebrity, I'm slightly telepathic.

385
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:00,640
 Oh, here we go.

386
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:05,160
 I can do, there's an online site where you can do, I get scores way, way way above chance.

387
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:06,160
 Right.

388
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:09,640
 It's that you have to guess where a thing is under a hidden map as it is.

389
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:12,920
 That's called My Sweeper, isn't it?

390
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:16,480
 I'm actually getting telepathic messages right now from Andy and James Sinclair and what

391
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:19,800
 the fuck have you done to our podcast by introducing this subject?

392
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:20,800
 Can you hear it?

393
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:30,800
 Okay, it is time for fact number two and that is My Fact.

394
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:35,800
 My Fact this week is that in Hawaii, a tightly guarded secret that used to be passed down

395
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:40,480
 from generation to generation was how people used to tune their guitars.

396
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:41,480
 Sorry.

397
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:45,920
 Surely everyone knows that, there's little knobs aren't there on the end.

398
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:47,680
 We'll see what I tell you, dude.

399
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,080
 I don't know how to tune a guitar.

400
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:53,080
 Honestly, if we left you in a room with a guitar, you'd work it out pretty fast.

401
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:55,160
 If you'd say those knobs, they'd sound changes.

402
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:59,320
 Well, I know you turn the knobs, but I don't know, I'm very impressed when I see anyone

403
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:00,320
 do it.

404
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,600
 And also you shouldn't be.

405
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,600
 You wouldn't know what you were tuning it to, right?

406
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:04,600
 Oh, that's it.

407
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:05,600
 That's the thing.

408
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:11,000
 So a guitar, if you play a classical guitar, like I would tune a guitar or maybe James would

409
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,600
 tune a guitar, you're tuning is E-A-D-G-B-E, that's sort of the classic.

410
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:19,680
 And you can make classic E notes, G notes, all that, it's basic stuff, if you don't understand

411
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:20,680
 that at all, do we?

412
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:21,680
 No.

413
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:25,680
 If you tune it that way, that means wherever you put your fingers on the guitar, it will always

414
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:26,680
 sound the same.

415
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:27,680
 Yeah.

416
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,680
 And you just know where to put them, because you know how each one is.

417
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:30,680
 Okay.

418
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:31,680
 Okay.

419
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:32,680
 Child deserves fun.

420
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:33,680
 What happened?

421
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:34,680
 Is that what it is?

422
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:35,680
 Oh, that's the staves of a musical score, isn't it?

423
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,080
 Oh, every good boy deserves favor?

424
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:38,080
 That's it, yes.

425
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,080
 Yeah.

426
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:40,080
 Yeah.

427
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:43,160
 But this is very interesting, because this is slack key guitar in Hawaii.

428
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:49,560
 It's a Hawaiian guitar tradition that has been part of their world for hundreds of years.

429
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:56,480
 And the idea is that they all tune it differently to an open set of notes.

430
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:00,540
 When you then play it as an open chord, so you don't use your other hand, it plays a lovely

431
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:01,540
 in chord.

432
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:07,520
 And every family seemed to have designed its own different set of notes unique to them.

433
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:10,160
 And that's what would be passed down from family to family.

434
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:14,360
 Now the reason that this happened is almost to do with what you were saying, Andy.

435
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:20,020
 So when Captain Cook first came to Hawaii, there was a guy on board called Captain Vancouver

436
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:23,200
 who was the captain of the next vote that came to Hawaii.

437
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:27,200
 And he brought a bunch of cattle, and the cattle arrived and it was roaming around.

438
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:29,400
 And the king of Hawaii didn't know what to do with them.

439
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:30,400
 Well, there's this guy.

440
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,840
 Oh, this is the origin story of the guitar in Hawaii.

441
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:33,840
 It's really interesting.

442
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:38,720
 Now, in those days in Hawaii, we always tied that idea to our balance.

443
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,720
 [laughs]

444
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,200
 Cattles roving free in Hawaii.

445
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,200
 They don't know what to do.

446
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:47,960
 So they decided to bring in some Mexican and Spanish cowboys to teach them how to farm.

447
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:48,960
 The hells!

448
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:49,960
 Yes, exactly.

449
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:50,960
 They brought their guitars.

450
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,200
 They played the guitars.

451
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:55,100
 And then when they left, they left them the guitars.

452
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:58,220
 After a while, a bunch of them went, "How do we even tune these things?"

453
00:17:58,220 --> 00:18:00,400
 And they weren't quite sure the classical tunings.

454
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,000
 So they had to create their own tunings.

455
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,280
 And family by family, this is what they did.

456
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:06,200
 And all these beautiful songs started emerging.

457
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:10,480
 Dan, you sent down a link like we always do with these facts just so that we can check

458
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,280
 that they're true.

459
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:13,280
 And we all do it.

460
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:14,280
 We all do it.

461
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:15,280
 We all do it.

462
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:16,280
 We all do it.

463
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:17,280
 We all do it.

464
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,280
 We all do it.

465
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:19,280
 I mean, this idea came about because of Dan's rights.

466
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:20,280
 But we all do it.

467
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:21,280
 Yeah, yeah.

468
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:23,960
 And this was about a guy called Raymond Cane.

469
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:28,520
 But he has a middle name that I wonder if he read his middle name.

470
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:29,520
 Oh, yes, I did.

471
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:30,520
 Yeah.

472
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:31,920
 Well, you're so good at pronouncing things, Dan.

473
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:34,880
 I wonder if he'd like to just remind us what his middle name is.

474
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:35,880
 Oh, my God.

475
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:36,880
 Yeah.

476
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:37,880
 It's just there.

477
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:38,880
 Oh, OK.

478
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:41,320
 Well, this is going to be embarrassing for you because as it turns out, this is my middle name

479
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:42,320
 as well.

480
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:49,640
 So it's Cali o aloha poina alle o hele manu.

481
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:50,640
 No, hele manu.

482
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,840
 Oh, he's got so close.

483
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,640
 So doing the Australian.

484
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:59,400
 Do you know Alan Davis and I went to see the Swedish version of QI years ago.

485
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:00,400
 Oh, yeah.

486
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:05,080
 And as the producer, very sweetly said, John, it's such an honor to have you here as the

487
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:10,080
 director of the whole thing that we, it's, you know, would you kindly introduce the guests

488
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:14,840
 and you gave me the list of Swedish guests and I read them all out and they're audience

489
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:15,840
 were in his steering.

490
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:18,120
 I didn't get one syllable right.

491
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:19,920
 They were screaming.

492
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:22,560
 Who was Raymond Cane?

493
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:23,560
 He was.

494
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:24,560
 Good question.

495
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:25,720
 He was a slack key guitarist.

496
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:26,720
 OK.

497
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:29,360
 And I think the thing you sent around was no bit tree of him.

498
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:30,360
 It was.

499
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:31,360
 Yeah, that's right.

500
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:34,000
 I don't play the guitar at all, but I do play a bit of piano.

501
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
 Yep.

502
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:39,760
 And obviously one thing I know is about pianos where middle C is, but I didn't know and

503
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:40,760
 this is the most interesting thing.

504
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:46,320
 I think I found out in the whole month is there are three middle C's on the guitar.

505
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,720
 Did you, did you work that out yourself when you were tuning it?

506
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:53,520
 If you're tuning on your own, you'll use your lowest E string as a guide to the next

507
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:54,920
 string because you can play all the chords.

508
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:57,760
 I do the other way from the highest E string onto the next one.

509
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:58,760
 Right.

510
00:19:58,760 --> 00:19:59,760
 So what you, what you do is you find.

511
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:00,760
 But do you know where middle C is?

512
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:01,760
 Yeah.

513
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:02,760
 OK.

514
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:03,760
 Name it.

515
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:04,760
 OK.

516
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:05,760
 First.

517
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:06,760
 First.

518
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:07,760
 First of the second string.

519
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:08,760
 Fifth of the third string.

520
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:09,760
 And tenth of the fourth string.

521
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,600
 I don't know what any of those things mean.

522
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:12,600
 OK.

523
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:13,600
 This is also why the quiz failed.

524
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,600
 You give the artist before the person gets the guess.

525
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:16,600
 Oh, yeah, yeah.

526
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:18,120
 But then I'm allowed to say.

527
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:20,360
 I'm allowed to say, yeah, I do all that.

528
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:21,880
 I get the point.

529
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:23,600
 I'm trade secrets in music.

530
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:24,600
 Oh, yeah.

531
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:25,600
 As this is a bit of a trade secret.

532
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:26,600
 Yeah.

533
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,360
 How these Hawaiian families kept their guitars.

534
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:34,400
 That is proof legally that an album can be a trade secret.

535
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,400
 What does that mean?

536
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,400
 OK.

537
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,800
 Have you heard of the Wuteng clan show?

538
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:39,800
 Oh, yeah.

539
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:40,800
 I've seen them.

540
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:41,800
 I saw them in Aspen, Colorado.

541
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:42,800
 Amazing.

542
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:46,360
 Why do you used to be in the Wuteng club?

543
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:47,360
 The Lizzer.

544
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:48,360
 Yeah.

545
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:49,840
 This is one of the most amazing things.

546
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:50,840
 Imagine you're at a Wuteng gig.

547
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:53,440
 You turn around and John Lloyd and Rowan Atkinston.

548
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:55,760
 Mr. Bean is standing at a Wuteng kind.

549
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:56,760
 Yeah.

550
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:57,760
 That's what you went to, right?

551
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:57,760
 Yeah.

552
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:58,760
 Yeah.

553
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:02,240
 So is this about the time when they released one record?

554
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:03,240
 One record.

555
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:04,240
 Yes.

556
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:10,000
 They released, they recorded a secret album in 2007 and they made one hard copy of it.

557
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,080
 So it doesn't exist outside this hard copy of it.

558
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:15,800
 And an American, a wealthy American guy called Martin Shrekley.

559
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:16,800
 Super controversial.

560
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:17,800
 Yeah.

561
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:18,800
 Super controversial.

562
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:19,800
 Yeah.

563
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:20,800
 Super controversial.

564
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:21,800
 Yeah.

565
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:22,800
 Super controversial.

566
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:23,800
 He bought it for $2 million.

567
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,680
 And there were very strict restrictions on how it could be played or reproduced for all

568
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:28,360
 of that for the next 90 odd years.

569
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:32,200
 Eventually, in unrelated reasons, he was sent to prison for fraud.

570
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,200
 No, no, no.

571
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:38,000
 I think they might have been slightly related to the fact that he had 2 million quid to spend

572
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
 on one record.

573
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
 Okay.

574
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
 So that's very true.

575
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
 Yeah.

576
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
 Yeah.

577
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
 Yeah.

578
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
 I think, just for the...

579
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
 No, you're absolutely right.

580
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
 Just for the lion's listening.

581
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,440
 So as part of that deal, he, as part of him going to prison for fraud, the album had to be

582
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:51,440
 sold off, right?

583
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:55,800
 And it got sold off to a crypto firm called Pleasardau.

584
00:21:55,800 --> 00:22:00,160
 And then when Shrekley got out, nonetheless, despite the album having been sold off, he started

585
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:02,160
 playing it for loads of people online.

586
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:03,160
 Yeah.

587
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:04,160
 And the crypto firm sued him.

588
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:08,440
 And all of this led to a judge decreeing that an album can be technically a tried secret.

589
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:09,440
 Yeah.

590
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:12,280
 I've got two secrets from the meaning of Liff, two secrety words.

591
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:13,280
 Oh, cool.

592
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:18,520
 Mary Tavi, which you probably know is a place in Devon, a Mary Tavi is a person to whom

593
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:24,240
 under dire injunctions of silence, you tell a secret you wish to be far more widely known.

594
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:25,240
 Lovely.

595
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:26,240
 Useful one.

596
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:32,680
 And Tuky Tuky, which is a place in New Zealand, Tuky Tuky is a sexual liaison, which is meant

597
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:35,440
 to be secret, but which is, in fact, common knowledge.

598
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:37,440
 That's a nice word.

599
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:38,440
 Chartres.

600
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:39,440
 Oh, yeah.

601
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:40,440
 Drink?

602
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:41,440
 Yes.

603
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:42,440
 Green.

604
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:43,440
 Yeah.

605
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:44,440
 The recipe is only known by two monks.

606
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:45,440
 No.

607
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:46,440
 Apparently so.

608
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:47,440
 Really?

609
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:48,440
 Yeah.

610
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:51,880
 Tuky Kola one famously is bit secret.

611
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:54,280
 You know, they use Chartres to die the Chicago ribbon?

612
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:55,280
 Of course that's not.

613
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:56,280
 Yeah.

614
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:58,760
 That's where the fish are so cheerful all the time.

615
00:22:58,760 --> 00:22:59,760
 Yeah.

616
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:00,760
 The Coca-Cola one's really interesting.

617
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:06,440
 So they have like a secret formula, which they say, oh, no one can work out what this

618
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:07,440
 is and all that.

619
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:09,960
 And actually, you can kind of pretty easily work out what it is.

620
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:14,920
 But obviously Pepsi has the same thing because they make arguably the same drink.

621
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:17,600
 I know they slightly taste different, but they're pretty much the same thing.

622
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:20,040
 But why do they not have secret ingredients?

623
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:23,920
 Like they don't say, oh, we have a secret thing called 7x that nobody knows about.

624
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:24,920
 Yeah.

625
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:27,400
 Because no one really likes Pepsi.

626
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:28,400
 No.

627
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,400
 Is that it?

628
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:30,400
 No.

629
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:33,400
 Because I think you'll find that the advertising campaign in the 90s showed that everyone

630
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:35,520
 loves Pepsi.

631
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:36,520
 And today we're sponsored.

632
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:37,520
 No.

633
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:38,520
 Yeah.

634
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:44,480
 Basically, they just use normal law and just make people sign non-disclosure agreements.

635
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:48,760
 And if they give the secrets away, they sue them and stuff rather than saying that they have

636
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:51,160
 some sort of secret ingredient that no one can know.

637
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:58,720
 Because it does seem mad that you can keep like with so much regulation and all the warnings

638
00:23:58,720 --> 00:23:59,720
 on the back of a packet.

639
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:01,640
 We can just have a secret sauce in there.

640
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:06,160
 You have to sort of, I think you have to register it somewhere, but it's accepted legally as

641
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:07,160
 a trade secret.

642
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:08,160
 That's the thing.

643
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:09,160
 Got it.

644
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:10,160
 So it is a special legal framework.

645
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:13,280
 It's got an injunction on it, basically, kind of.

646
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:14,280
 But there is a thing.

647
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:15,280
 Okay.

648
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:16,280
 It's our age for nilla, cinnamon, and...

649
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:17,280
 Don't say the five.

650
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:18,920
 Don't say the one or the one.

651
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:20,760
 And dead animals.

652
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:25,840
 Well, we had an email from listener Esther Nelken who says, "You may have covered this

653
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:26,840
 previously."

654
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:28,040
 We haven't covered this previously.

655
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:33,480
 But in order for Coca-Cola to be recognised as kosher, a rabbi had to be told the secret

656
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:38,880
 formula in 1935, rabbi Tobias Geffen signed an NDA and was allowed to investigate the

657
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:39,880
 ingredients.

658
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:40,880
 Wow.

659
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:43,920
 And she adds, "I couldn't find who the rabbi is today who holds the information."

660
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:48,000
 That's a damn brown novel waiting to be written, isn't it?

661
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
 So right.

662
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,000
 You're so right.

663
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,120
 I've got some specifically Hawaiian secrets here.

664
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:54,120
 Oh, cool.

665
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:58,960
 That physicist at the University of Hawaii have recently solved the problem, the secret of

666
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:02,120
 how washing machines get clothes clean.

667
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:03,760
 It's never been known until now.

668
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:04,760
 Wow.

669
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:08,360
 So there are now two physicists who know the secret of how that works.

670
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:11,920
 And the other one is that 2018 was a bad year for Hawaii.

671
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:15,240
 They had a massive volcanic explosion.

672
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:20,200
 And the authorities warned people not to toast marshmallows over it, which was a very

673
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:21,200
 good advice.

674
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:27,040
 But they also had in 2018, 38 minutes of panic, after a wrongly pressed button set off an

675
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:30,720
 alert warning of an incoming ballistic missile attack.

676
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:31,720
 Wow.

677
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:35,880
 And the way it's connected with secret is the governor of Hawaii couldn't correct the

678
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:40,560
 false missile alert for 17 minutes because he didn't know how to log on to his own Twitter

679
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:42,560
 and Facebook accounts.

680
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:43,560
 Wow.

681
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:44,560
 They were kept from him.

682
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:48,520
 Well, only one rabbi in Hawaii knew what the password was.

683
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:50,320
 That was mad, wasn't it, when that happened?

684
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:51,320
 Yeah.

685
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:55,000
 I think a lot of people just started going round telling, you know, telling people about

686
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,360
 the secretly A-zons and stuff like that because of all of them.

687
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:58,360
 Dookie dookie.

688
00:25:58,360 --> 00:25:59,840
 It's the end of the world.

689
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:02,480
 We did it in the book that we were writing the books of the year at the time and there

690
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:04,480
 was definitely an article about that.

691
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:05,480
 Yes.

692
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:09,640
 And I think it's, I think it was the second time that the person who accidentally sent

693
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:11,560
 the alert out had made this mistake.

694
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:15,760
 And it was, it was something stupid, like there were two buttons next to each other.

695
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:17,680
 It was, I think it was a drop down menu.

696
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:18,680
 That's right.

697
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:23,280
 And it was a drop down menu and it was send nuclear alert brackets test or send out of office

698
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:24,280
 reply.

699
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:25,280
 Yeah.

700
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:33,480
 Okay, it is time for fact number three.

701
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:34,480
 That is James.

702
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:40,560
 Okay, my fact this week is that in 1874, the world's largest pearl got lost down the back

703
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:42,560
 of a sofa.

704
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:46,880
 And was this a kind of princess on the P-style situation?

705
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:47,880
 Expand.

706
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:50,040
 Well, yeah, easy.

707
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:51,040
 Okay.

708
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:54,560
 They kept putting cushions on top of the sofa.

709
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:55,560
 Yeah.

710
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:58,280
 And it was only found when, I can't remember the original fairy tale now, is it the true

711
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:02,560
 princess can identify the world's largest pearl down the back of a sofa?

712
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:03,560
 Is it James?

713
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:04,560
 It's not that.

714
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:05,560
 It's not that.

715
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:10,040
 It's not that complete misrememberance of a fairy story.

716
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:11,040
 Anyone else?

717
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:15,160
 No, this is something I read in BBC History magazine.

718
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:22,800
 It was an article by Kate Williams and it's about the La Peregrina pearl and sofa in Windsor

719
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:27,840
 Castle and how the two things interacted in 1874.

720
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:33,400
 And it was a woman called the Duchess of Abacorn who was at a party with her husband

721
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:39,480
 James Hamilton and she momentarily lost a pearl down the back of the sofa but it was enough

722
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:41,960
 that it was recorded and we now know about it.

723
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:48,360
 Is it such a massive pearl that it would seriously damage the sofa?

724
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:49,360
 No.

725
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:50,360
 How big is it?

726
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:52,360
 Would you feel a lump if you sat down on it?

727
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:53,360
 That's what I'm trying to think.

728
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:54,360
 Like the princess and the P.

729
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:56,360
 Oh, I was thinking more of the current buns.

730
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:57,360
 Current buns, yeah, true.

731
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:58,360
 Yeah.

732
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:02,200
 If you sat directly onto it with no sofa involved, you would feel it on your bum.

733
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:03,200
 Yeah, sure.

734
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:09,760
 In the sofa, I don't think so because it is about 11.2 grams in weight, which is about the

735
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:13,920
 same weight as a world's smallest monkey.

736
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:17,040
 If you sat on the world's smallest monkey, would you feel that?

737
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:18,040
 You'd feel it, but not this.

738
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:19,040
 It's like a cushion.

739
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:22,560
 You'd feel it for sure, but not necessarily if it was inside a sofa.

740
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:25,360
 And can you give us a size rather than the weight?

741
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:28,720
 No, I'm afraid I can give you more versions of the weight.

742
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:36,120
 So it was 55.95 carrots, four ounces or 223.8 grains.

743
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:41,320
 How long was this this very large or small weight and with a certain weight?

744
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:42,320
 How long was it lost for?

745
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:45,320
 It was lost, momentarily.

746
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:47,520
 This is a fascinating fact.

747
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:48,520
 It was weight.

748
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:49,520
 I've lost my glasses.

749
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:51,520
 No, there they are on my head.

750
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:55,520
 It was interesting enough that Kate Williams wrote about a BBC history magazine.

751
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:58,680
 What I think of the most interesting thing is how small monkeys get these.

752
00:28:58,680 --> 00:28:59,680
 I'm staggered.

753
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:02,440
 An adult monkey that weighs 11 grams.

754
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:03,440
 Have you seen those monkeys?

755
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:06,640
 There's like these monkeys that you put them on your finger and they just hold on like

756
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:07,640
 a baby baby.

757
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:08,640
 That's a toy.

758
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:09,640
 No, you do.

759
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:10,640
 They do exist.

760
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:11,640
 That's incredible.

761
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:12,640
 That's incredible.

762
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:13,640
 It is incredible.

763
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:17,480
 I think why it's notable is that this is not just any ordinary pearl.

764
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:19,840
 It's not just that it was the world largest at the time.

765
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:21,080
 This is La Peregrina.

766
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:22,080
 Yeah.

767
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:23,080
 I said that.

768
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:24,080
 This is the wonderer.

769
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:28,680
 This is a pearl that has been part of so much history.

770
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:31,360
 You can see it in the portraits of Mary Tudor.

771
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:33,040
 She was wearing this pearl.

772
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:37,680
 It made it all all the way into the modern day to Elizabeth Taylor who wore it in two movies.

773
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:39,520
 It's just had this amazing history.

774
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:41,800
 The idea that you could lose this at all.

775
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:42,800
 I know.

776
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:48,480
 Just to say on Elizabeth Taylor, she got given it by Richard Burton, her husband a couple

777
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:49,480
 of times.

778
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:57,800
 And she lost it in a dog's mouth again momentarily and the pearl was the same size on both

779
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:58,800
 occasions.

780
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:04,240
 But yeah, she lost it and she was really worried because this was a very iconic piece of

781
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:05,240
 jewelry.

782
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:09,480
 And she looked in her dog's mouth and there it was extraordinary.

783
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:10,480
 So pearls.

784
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:11,480
 Oh, yeah.

785
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:12,480
 Famous pearls.

786
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:13,480
 This one's called La Peregrina.

787
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:14,480
 Right?

788
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:15,480
 Yeah.

789
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:20,720
 It's another incredibly famous pearl called La Peregrina.

790
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:21,720
 Oh my gosh.

791
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:22,720
 No.

792
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:23,720
 It's so weird.

793
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:24,720
 And this one is also one of the most storied pearls.

794
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:29,840
 This one's been through France, maybe Louis XVI, it was involved in the October revolution

795
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:31,760
 in Russia, not in a key role.

796
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:32,760
 What is that?

797
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:33,760
 La Grina mean.

798
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:36,560
 Because Peregrina means a female pilgrim presumed, isn't it?

799
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:39,440
 Peregrina is the wandering one, isn't it?

800
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:40,440
 Yeah.

801
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:41,440
 And I don't wonder.

802
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:42,440
 La Peregrina.

803
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:44,040
 I haven't actually written down the meaning of it.

804
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:45,040
 I don't know.

805
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:46,680
 Isn't it bottled water, isn't it?

806
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:47,680
 Peregrina, isn't it?

807
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:49,680
 It's a female bottled water.

808
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:50,680
 That's it.

809
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:51,680
 That's it.

810
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:52,680
 Yeah.

811
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:57,960
 So you know how mollusks of all sorts make pearls.

812
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:58,960
 Yeah.

813
00:30:58,960 --> 00:30:59,920
 A lot of all sorts, a few specific sorts.

814
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:04,760
 So what is it like they get a bit of grit in them and they put something around it or

815
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:05,760
 something?

816
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:06,760
 Yeah.

817
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:10,760
 The main idea is that pearls form around a grain of sand or a bit of grit.

818
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:16,440
 In fact, it's almost always a parasitic worm that gets inside the muscle or the oyster

819
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:17,440
 or whatever.

820
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:18,440
 I know.

821
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:20,960
 And they just coat it in the sticky stuff and then they keep on coating.

822
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:23,040
 And that's how pearl develops.

823
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:26,600
 But this is the amazing thing about how mollusks make them.

824
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:32,040
 They can moderate the thickness of the layers that they produce.

825
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:33,480
 I find this really weird.

826
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:38,880
 If a layer of a pearl is a bit thick on one side, the next layer will be thinner on that

827
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:39,880
 one side in response.

828
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:42,160
 Oh, that's why they're pure circles.

829
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:47,200
 That's why they're perfectly round, is because they're constantly balancing out to make

830
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,200
 it so I know.

831
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:53,040
 And that this was studied by scientists who cut pearls with a diamond wire saw and then

832
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:57,120
 polished them and counted the layers and measured the thickness of all the layers.

833
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:58,120
 That's really cool.

834
00:31:58,120 --> 00:31:59,120
 It's really craft.

835
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:00,120
 They're actually crafty.

836
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:01,120
 Yeah, yeah.

837
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:02,120
 That's really beautiful.

838
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:05,120
 You know what, the oysters that you get pearls in are not the same as the oysters that

839
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:06,120
 you eat.

840
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:07,120
 Is that so?

841
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:08,120
 Yeah.

842
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:09,120
 They're different species.

843
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:13,800
 They're in the same family, but that's as closely as they're related.

844
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:18,640
 So the eater oysters are in Australia dye and the pearl oysters are in their terry dye.

845
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:23,120
 I thought when you said the eating oysters, I thought very upper-class oysters were very

846
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:24,440
 well-educated.

847
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:32,200
 So those two types of oysters are less closely related to each other than we are to the world's

848
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,520
 smallest monkey.

849
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:40,880
 So while these say the appearance of the world's smallest monkey, he's the size of a pearl

850
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:41,880
 now.

851
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:44,440
 It's the size of the world's biggest pearl.

852
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:46,920
 At the time, which actually is not the world's biggest pearl anymore.

853
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:47,920
 No, no, absolutely.

854
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:52,840
 The world's biggest pearl is the gigapurl, which was discovered in the Philippines, and is

855
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:54,840
 I'd say that one.

856
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:55,840
 Don't know.

857
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:56,840
 Yeah.

858
00:32:56,840 --> 00:33:00,920
 It's 27, just over 27 kilos and it's the size of a female chimp.

859
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:02,720
 That's a hell of a jump from 11 grams.

860
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:03,720
 Yeah.

861
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:04,720
 27 kilos.

862
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:06,080
 But it's not like a really beautiful one.

863
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:07,920
 It looks kind of a bit ugly, doesn't it?

864
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:09,560
 But it's not a perfect round pearl.

865
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:10,560
 No, no, no.

866
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:12,800
 It looks a bit like a monkey brain.

867
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:13,800
 I think I saw a picture of it.

868
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:14,800
 Yeah.

869
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:15,800
 It looks a bit.

870
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:19,640
 We didn't know we had it for a long time because this Filipino man who owned it just kept

871
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:20,640
 it under his bed.

872
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:21,640
 He didn't know what it was.

873
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:25,160
 He had it for 10 years and eventually he just had to get it out of the house.

874
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:28,840
 If James's fact would be a lot more interesting, the pearl was lost for 10 years down the

875
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:32,640
 back of his sofa, then we could have paid attention.

876
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:35,240
 I think that interest me is James.

877
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:40,880
 The thing that interest me is value, all right, so why do we decide that pearls are valuable?

878
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:45,160
 So for example Mark Twain's great quote, "I wonder how much people would pay for a soap

879
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:50,720
 bubble, if there's only one in the world that wonderful iridescence you get on bubbles."

880
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:56,120
 And in some cultures, mother of pearl, that marvellous thing you get inside the shell

881
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:58,400
 is more valuable than the pearl themselves.

882
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:02,120
 The Japanese divers used to throw away the pearls because they're collecting the mother of

883
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:03,440
 pearl.

884
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:10,280
 And yet, according to Suetonius, the Roman historian, the main reason Julius Caesar invaded

885
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:12,360
 Britain, do you know what it was?

886
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:19,720
 It wasn't tin or leather, I think it was because I had the biggest supply of freshwater pearls

887
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:20,720
 in mussels.

888
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:21,720
 Really?

889
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:22,720
 Do we still have pearls?

890
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:23,720
 The biggest in Europe.

891
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:27,200
 I've been to a pearl farm in the UK somewhere, I'm sure, maybe it was in the Isle of White

892
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:28,200
 or somewhere.

893
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:29,200
 Right.

894
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:30,200
 But do we make pearls in this country?

895
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:31,200
 We do.

896
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:32,200
 I don't know.

897
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:36,600
 There aren't any pearl factories, I think, but freshwater pearl mussels are a big deal.

898
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:37,600
 Okay.

899
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:40,480
 And they're being re-bred and re-introduced, and they're more common in Scotland because

900
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:44,040
 the waters just lock cleaner up there, basically, and the mussels can survive.

901
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:46,040
 But yeah, you get British pearls.

902
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:47,040
 Right.

903
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:48,520
 And in fact, they're incredibly weird.

904
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:51,120
 They release millions of larvae into the water.

905
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:52,120
 That's how they breathe.

906
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:53,520
 It's called a sperm cast.

907
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:54,520
 Yep.

908
00:34:54,520 --> 00:35:00,600
 Which is something else around, yeah, yeah.

909
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:04,160
 And then they hope to get themselves swallowed by a passing salmon.

910
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:07,200
 This is their tactic, or this is their life cycle, basically.

911
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:11,520
 They spend a year living on the gills of this salmon or a brown trout, and then they drop

912
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:15,600
 off the gills after a year and they burrow into the riverbed, and they can live in a riverbed

913
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:16,600
 for 130 years.

914
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:17,600
 What?

915
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:18,600
 Wow.

916
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:19,600
 There will be some.

917
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:20,600
 Wow.

918
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:26,040
 There could be pearls in the UK, which remember Queen Victoria, or which were around in the

919
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:27,040
 time of Queen Victoria.

920
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:28,040
 Yes.

921
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:29,040
 That's crazy.

922
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:30,040
 That's very nice.

923
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:34,880
 Well, they might remember, then, if they remember that time, we were talking about the

924
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:39,480
 fact that this pearl was lost at Windsor Castle, but something was also lost in a sofa

925
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:45,260
 in Buckingham Palace, while Queen Victoria was Queen, and that was a 14-year-old boy of

926
00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:46,260
 Palace.

927
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:47,260
 Yeah.

928
00:35:47,260 --> 00:35:48,260
 They just lost the boy.

929
00:35:48,260 --> 00:35:51,060
 Yeah, for a momentarily off for a hundred and a half years.

930
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:54,300
 Was he larger or smaller than the world's smallest monkey?

931
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:55,300
 He was called Boy Jones.

932
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:56,300
 He's quite famous.

933
00:35:56,300 --> 00:35:57,300
 Edward Jones.

934
00:35:57,300 --> 00:36:01,980
 He was the first ever celebrity stalker, broke into Buckingham Palace multiple times, sat

935
00:36:01,980 --> 00:36:05,780
 on the edge of a bed once, took her underwear, boy Jones.

936
00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:06,780
 Oh, boy Jones.

937
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:09,500
 Yeah, he hid under a sofa at that point.

938
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:10,500
 Was he actually a boy?

939
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:11,500
 Yeah.

940
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:12,500
 Yeah, it was 14.

941
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:13,500
 Yeah, 14.

942
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:16,260
 I don't think he was taking the underwear because he was a pervert.

943
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:19,380
 I think he was just wanting to show that he would, he'd been there.

944
00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:22,220
 Well, he was a 14-year-old boy, so it was probably a bit of a pervert.

945
00:36:22,220 --> 00:36:25,500
 It's all like all 14-year-old boys.

946
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:26,500
 Yeah.

947
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:29,780
 Tell me if I'm wrong about this, but I think they caught him, and then they let him go,

948
00:36:29,780 --> 00:36:32,180
 and then they caught him again, and then they sent him to Australia.

949
00:36:32,180 --> 00:36:34,460
 Yeah, they were like, "Okay, you've broken in twice.

950
00:36:34,460 --> 00:36:37,100
 Where can we put you that will just make it that slight bit more hard?"

951
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:38,100
 Yeah.

952
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:39,100
 To get in Australia.

953
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:40,100
 Wow.

954
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:41,100
 Do we know what he did in Australia?

955
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:42,100
 Did he?

956
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:43,100
 I think he dishears from history.

957
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:44,100
 Right.

958
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:46,500
 Yeah, I think if memory serves.

959
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:50,140
 I think he took the underwear with him, and he opened a brand of shops called Victoria's

960
00:36:50,140 --> 00:36:51,140
 Secrets.

961
00:36:51,140 --> 00:36:52,140
 Beautiful.

962
00:36:52,140 --> 00:36:53,140
 Beautiful.

963
00:36:53,140 --> 00:36:59,540
 I, you say the world's largest pearl, I researched the world's largest things.

964
00:36:59,540 --> 00:37:00,540
 Okay.

965
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:05,140
 So the Kuku in the world's largest Kuku clock weighs 23 and a half stone.

966
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:06,140
 Wow.

967
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:07,140
 Wow.

968
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:08,140
 Okay.

969
00:37:08,140 --> 00:37:14,940
 The world's largest container ship can carry 4,282,600 mattresses.

970
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:17,300
 Oh, but how many mumsets?

971
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:21,740
 That's what we all really want to set.

972
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:30,740
 And in 2018, in protest at losing access to the sea after a war with Chilean 1884, Bolivia

973
00:37:30,740 --> 00:37:32,740
 displayed the world's largest flag.

974
00:37:32,740 --> 00:37:34,860
 Do you know how big it is?

975
00:37:34,860 --> 00:37:38,540
 It's three meters wide and 200 kilometers long.

976
00:37:38,540 --> 00:37:39,540
 Sorry, yes, I did.

977
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:42,940
 No, we're just going to continue with that quiz from Biffle.

978
00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:44,980
 Down another point to James.

979
00:37:44,980 --> 00:37:48,780
 You were killing this one.

980
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:55,940
 Okay, it's time for our final fact of the show, and that is John.

981
00:37:55,940 --> 00:38:04,340
 Okay, my fact is, for a shipworm, the most nutritious part of an ice lolly is the stick.

982
00:38:04,340 --> 00:38:07,460
 The perfect companion for a day of the beach.

983
00:38:07,460 --> 00:38:08,460
 Yes.

984
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:09,460
 You have the lolly there, the stick.

985
00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:10,940
 It's like Jack Spratt had his wife.

986
00:38:10,940 --> 00:38:11,940
 Yes.

987
00:38:11,940 --> 00:38:14,900
 Now, you obviously all know what a shipworm is.

988
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:19,940
 I'm guessing, but for people who don't know, shipworms are not worms.

989
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:20,940
 Yeah.

990
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:23,500
 They are a kind of clam.

991
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:29,900
 And unlike normal clams, or mussels or oysters, you know, reference the pearls, they don't

992
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:30,900
 have a proper shell.

993
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:36,220
 They're shells have evolved to slide off down the body and become a sort of amazing little

994
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:42,140
 jaw thing, like a little hat, like a little helmet, but covered with lots of tiny teeth.

995
00:38:42,140 --> 00:38:47,540
 And they use these to bore into, they start as tiny larvae as thin as a needle, and they

996
00:38:47,540 --> 00:38:54,580
 bore into ships and wolves and peers and that kind of thing and destroy them by honeycombing

997
00:38:54,580 --> 00:38:55,580
 them.

998
00:38:55,580 --> 00:38:56,580
 Wow.

999
00:38:56,580 --> 00:39:00,020
 They're the bane of mariners and semen and sailors since forever.

1000
00:39:00,020 --> 00:39:01,900
 I mean, they're the most extraordinary thing.

1001
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:04,860
 They've altered modern history, haven't they?

1002
00:39:04,860 --> 00:39:05,860
 Yeah.

1003
00:39:05,860 --> 00:39:08,020
 Like, basically, they have transformed the world we live in.

1004
00:39:08,020 --> 00:39:12,260
 They're known as the termites of the sea, such an invasive problem.

1005
00:39:12,260 --> 00:39:14,740
 There's something mystical and magical about these things.

1006
00:39:14,740 --> 00:39:18,300
 There's a shipworm in every historical event that's on water.

1007
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:24,140
 So in 1503, shipworms honeycomb the hulls of Columbus' ships on his fourth voyage, two

1008
00:39:24,140 --> 00:39:27,700
 of them sank and had to be abandoned, and the other two, they just managed to get to

1009
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:30,220
 Jamaica where they were considered unsee-way.

1010
00:39:30,220 --> 00:39:33,900
 They were trapped there for a whole year, all of Columbus' men.

1011
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:39,460
 In 1580, when Francis Drake reached London after circumnavigating the globe, the golden

1012
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:43,740
 hind was rotten and spongy from shipworm and never sailed again.

1013
00:39:43,740 --> 00:39:49,500
 On James Cook's first voyage, his ship, HMS, and there was so badly damaged by shipworm,

1014
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:52,060
 it had to be hauled onto land and repaired three times.

1015
00:39:52,060 --> 00:39:53,340
 It just goes on.

1016
00:39:53,340 --> 00:39:57,020
 Shipworms helped England defeat the Spanish Armada for Christ's sake.

1017
00:39:57,020 --> 00:39:58,020
 Really?

1018
00:39:58,020 --> 00:39:59,020
 Yes.

1019
00:39:59,020 --> 00:40:00,020
 Yeah.

1020
00:40:00,020 --> 00:40:02,860
 Because the Spanish ships were much bigger and more powerful, but the shipworms made them

1021
00:40:02,860 --> 00:40:05,780
 weak and so cannibals would go straight through this rotten wood.

1022
00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:06,780
 Right.

1023
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:07,780
 That's very cool.

1024
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:09,780
 I mean, the cannibals had something to do with it.

1025
00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:10,780
 Yeah.

1026
00:40:10,780 --> 00:40:11,780
 I mean, that's, yeah.

1027
00:40:11,780 --> 00:40:15,300
 Their point of origin isn't even known, really, because they've just been spread worldwide

1028
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:16,300
 by boats.

1029
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:17,820
 So any time a ship takes it somewhere.

1030
00:40:17,820 --> 00:40:19,660
 Cryptogenesis, like, you know, the cryptid factor.

1031
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:20,660
 That's what it's called.

1032
00:40:20,660 --> 00:40:21,660
 Oh, really?

1033
00:40:21,660 --> 00:40:24,100
 If you don't know where something's from, it's called cryptogenesis.

1034
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:25,100
 Right.

1035
00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:28,460
 Or knows where the cryptid factor came from.

1036
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:31,580
 Or where it's going.

1037
00:40:31,580 --> 00:40:36,260
 Wikipedia is very, I'd say, is very horny for shipworms.

1038
00:40:36,260 --> 00:40:40,940
 It describes them as a group of saltwater clams with long, soft, naked bodies.

1039
00:40:40,940 --> 00:40:41,940
 Wow.

1040
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:42,940
 Wow.

1041
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:43,940
 Wow.

1042
00:40:43,940 --> 00:40:44,940
 It's quite something, isn't it?

1043
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:45,940
 Yeah.

1044
00:40:45,940 --> 00:40:46,940
 You know, we all have naked bodies until we put clothes on.

1045
00:40:46,940 --> 00:40:47,940
 Well, that's true.

1046
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:51,940
 But are they long and soft?

1047
00:40:51,940 --> 00:40:56,260
 This is for sperm cast, Andy.

1048
00:40:56,260 --> 00:41:00,220
 Well, I saw a description of, they don't look very nice shipworms.

1049
00:41:00,220 --> 00:41:05,500
 It says, a shipworm's head under its little shell helmet looks like a blend of wet lips

1050
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:09,620
 and diseased intestines, and they have no eyes.

1051
00:41:09,620 --> 00:41:11,100
 And they breathe through their bottoms.

1052
00:41:11,100 --> 00:41:15,500
 I think, if you look like a mixture of wet lips and intestines or whatever it was, it's

1053
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:17,380
 probably good that you don't have any eyes.

1054
00:41:17,380 --> 00:41:18,380
 That's true.

1055
00:41:18,380 --> 00:41:23,460
 Well, also, they don't need to, they're very interesting things biologically, because they

1056
00:41:23,460 --> 00:41:28,860
 don't, I think, have to find a partner, because they all start out male.

1057
00:41:28,860 --> 00:41:33,940
 They just live as teenage boys, basically, on ships, burrowing into that.

1058
00:41:33,940 --> 00:41:35,820
 Then they just steal in queens underwear.

1059
00:41:35,820 --> 00:41:36,820
 That's it.

1060
00:41:36,820 --> 00:41:37,820
 Yeah.

1061
00:41:37,820 --> 00:41:38,660
 I think they just release sperm.

1062
00:41:38,660 --> 00:41:41,180
 Then they turn female.

1063
00:41:41,180 --> 00:41:44,380
 Then they just absorb the sperm that they just release when they were a teenage boy,

1064
00:41:44,380 --> 00:41:45,860
 and they use that to mate.

1065
00:41:45,860 --> 00:41:46,860
 Mmm.

1066
00:41:46,860 --> 00:41:47,860
 That's easy.

1067
00:41:47,860 --> 00:41:48,860
 It's an insult stream.

1068
00:41:48,860 --> 00:41:49,860
 It is.

1069
00:41:49,860 --> 00:41:50,860
 It absolutely is.

1070
00:41:50,860 --> 00:41:55,580
 So, wood eating creatures are called xylophages, as I'm sure you know.

1071
00:41:55,580 --> 00:41:58,580
 Now, of course, why do they eat wood?

1072
00:41:58,580 --> 00:42:03,660
 The answer is because wood is mostly made of cellulose, and cellulose get this, is entirely

1073
00:42:03,660 --> 00:42:04,660
 made of glucose.

1074
00:42:04,660 --> 00:42:05,660
 Did you know that?

1075
00:42:05,660 --> 00:42:06,660
 Oh.

1076
00:42:06,660 --> 00:42:09,420
 So, if you can digest wood, it's extremely nutritious.

1077
00:42:09,420 --> 00:42:11,020
 I mean, it really is.

1078
00:42:11,020 --> 00:42:12,020
 Yum.

1079
00:42:12,020 --> 00:42:16,900
 That's why a shipworm would love an isolate, but only the stick it would want, because

1080
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:20,700
 there's more glucose in the stick than there is in the lolly.

1081
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:21,700
 Wow.

1082
00:42:21,700 --> 00:42:22,700
 I see.

1083
00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:25,700
 And that's why you shouldn't eat the stick of your lolly, because they're actually just very

1084
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:26,700
 sugary.

1085
00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:27,700
 Yeah, yeah.

1086
00:42:27,700 --> 00:42:31,460
 If you had the right bacteria inside your stomach, you would be able to eat it, right?

1087
00:42:31,460 --> 00:42:34,020
 Because it's in all these animals that eat wood.

1088
00:42:34,020 --> 00:42:37,380
 They have some special bacteria in their stomach that can digest the wood.

1089
00:42:37,380 --> 00:42:38,380
 Is that right?

1090
00:42:38,380 --> 00:42:39,380
 Yes, that's right.

1091
00:42:39,380 --> 00:42:40,380
 Yeah, yeah.

1092
00:42:40,380 --> 00:42:41,380
 So, why do we not do that?

1093
00:42:41,380 --> 00:42:44,580
 There must be some kind of pill you can take to give you that, like some kind of

1094
00:42:44,580 --> 00:42:46,740
 yackel that will give you the wood bacteria.

1095
00:42:46,740 --> 00:42:47,740
 Yeah.

1096
00:42:47,740 --> 00:42:48,740
 Like a bacteria transfer, right?

1097
00:42:48,740 --> 00:42:54,460
 I imagine a race of super soldiers who can just eat the wheat forests that the enemy are

1098
00:42:54,460 --> 00:42:55,460
 hiding in.

1099
00:42:55,460 --> 00:42:56,460
 Exactly.

1100
00:42:56,460 --> 00:43:02,940
 I just want to make the end of a bath very different, doesn't it?

1101
00:43:02,940 --> 00:43:06,940
 I just want to give a shout out for the positive side of shipworms, because obviously they

1102
00:43:06,940 --> 00:43:11,620
 look disgusting and they do all this damage and so on, but you know, one study estimates

1103
00:43:11,620 --> 00:43:16,340
 that shipworms have sunk more ships than pirates, I thought that was rather lovely.

1104
00:43:16,340 --> 00:43:19,860
 But they also do good things, and there's nothing good or bad in the universe.

1105
00:43:19,860 --> 00:43:23,100
 It's just, it depends which angle you're coming from.

1106
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:27,380
 So for example, they're responsible of cleaning up more driftwood in the world than anything

1107
00:43:27,380 --> 00:43:29,380
 else.

1108
00:43:29,380 --> 00:43:34,820
 And the rotary accents, so the way they drill is that little toothy, helmety thing, rotates

1109
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:36,940
 eight to ten times a minute.

1110
00:43:36,940 --> 00:43:43,380
 And this inspired Mark Brunel, Isambard Kingdom Brunel's dad, to invent the rotary tunneling

1111
00:43:43,380 --> 00:43:47,700
 machine that dug the first tunnel under the Thames, and which is still essentially used

1112
00:43:47,700 --> 00:43:48,700
 today.

1113
00:43:48,700 --> 00:43:49,700
 Wow.

1114
00:43:49,700 --> 00:43:50,700
 That's all to do with shipworms.

1115
00:43:50,700 --> 00:43:51,700
 So good for them.

1116
00:43:51,700 --> 00:43:52,700
 Very cool.

1117
00:43:52,700 --> 00:43:54,540
 And they gave us the industrial revolution.

1118
00:43:54,540 --> 00:43:55,540
 Did they?

1119
00:43:55,540 --> 00:43:56,540
 Shipworms.

1120
00:43:56,540 --> 00:43:57,540
 So kind of, yes.

1121
00:43:57,540 --> 00:44:03,500
 So because Britain needed metal ships to stop the shipworms from burrowing, we had to

1122
00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:08,020
 get lots of metal on what did we have, because Julius Caesar wasn't bothered about it, lots

1123
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:09,620
 of copper.

1124
00:44:09,620 --> 00:44:13,260
 And so we had to get at the copper, but it's underground.

1125
00:44:13,260 --> 00:44:17,140
 So you need to do lots of mining, and then there's lots of water under the mines.

1126
00:44:17,140 --> 00:44:19,540
 You need to get the water out, how do you get the water out?

1127
00:44:19,540 --> 00:44:24,900
 You create engines and Thomas Buchmann created the steam engine to drain mines, because we

1128
00:44:24,900 --> 00:44:28,180
 needed the copper, because we needed it to get rid of shipworms.

1129
00:44:28,180 --> 00:44:30,340
 And that is essentially what started the industrial revolution.

1130
00:44:30,340 --> 00:44:31,340
 Amazing.

1131
00:44:31,340 --> 00:44:32,340
 It's so cool.

1132
00:44:32,340 --> 00:44:34,340
 Lollie sticks.

1133
00:44:34,340 --> 00:44:35,340
 Yeah.

1134
00:44:35,340 --> 00:44:36,340
 Oh, yeah.

1135
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:38,020
 Do you remember when they had jokes on them?

1136
00:44:38,020 --> 00:44:39,020
 Oh, yeah.

1137
00:44:39,020 --> 00:44:40,020
 They're not still.

1138
00:44:40,020 --> 00:44:45,300
 No, they got phased out in 1988, do you know why they got phased out?

1139
00:44:45,300 --> 00:44:46,300
 I was.

1140
00:44:46,300 --> 00:44:49,580
 Because there was a reason that they gave, and then there was the actual reason.

1141
00:44:49,580 --> 00:44:50,580
 Because of woke.

1142
00:44:50,580 --> 00:44:51,580
 Because of woke.

1143
00:44:51,580 --> 00:44:52,580
 In 1988.

1144
00:44:52,580 --> 00:44:53,580
 Yeah.

1145
00:44:53,580 --> 00:44:54,580
 Because of early woke.

1146
00:44:54,580 --> 00:44:55,580
 What?

1147
00:44:55,580 --> 00:44:56,580
 Why?

1148
00:44:56,580 --> 00:44:59,900
 What was the reason they gave out of date jokes?

1149
00:44:59,900 --> 00:45:01,900
 Oh, that come on.

1150
00:45:01,900 --> 00:45:04,220
 In Britain, the land of the cracker.

1151
00:45:04,220 --> 00:45:07,220
 The land of the cracker.

1152
00:45:07,220 --> 00:45:08,220
 I would it.

1153
00:45:08,220 --> 00:45:09,220
 OK.

1154
00:45:09,220 --> 00:45:10,220
 I'm going to give you that.

1155
00:45:10,220 --> 00:45:15,740
 The official reason was that people had more sophisticated tastes than to, I mean, they're

1156
00:45:15,740 --> 00:45:17,540
 selling these to children, right?

1157
00:45:17,540 --> 00:45:18,540
 Yeah.

1158
00:45:18,540 --> 00:45:19,540
 So just get what joke tastes?

1159
00:45:19,540 --> 00:45:20,540
 Yeah, yeah.

1160
00:45:20,540 --> 00:45:22,540
 What do they want, like lengthy observational stuff on the thing?

1161
00:45:22,540 --> 00:45:23,540
 Just stupidly sense.

1162
00:45:23,540 --> 00:45:31,140
 But the actual reason is because they were selling them abroad.

1163
00:45:31,140 --> 00:45:33,780
 So you had a big batch of ice lollies that you made.

1164
00:45:33,780 --> 00:45:34,780
 Right.

1165
00:45:34,780 --> 00:45:36,900
 And they wouldn't all be sold in English-speaking countries.

1166
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:41,780
 So there's no point putting English jokes on there, because 50% of them would be in Spain

1167
00:45:41,780 --> 00:45:42,780
 off of France, Hollywood.

1168
00:45:42,780 --> 00:45:43,780
 Yes.

1169
00:45:43,780 --> 00:45:44,780
 Such a shame.

1170
00:45:44,780 --> 00:45:47,260
 I remember having jokes on my lollies today.

1171
00:45:47,260 --> 00:45:48,260
 Yeah, sure.

1172
00:45:48,260 --> 00:45:49,260
 I don't remember that.

1173
00:45:49,260 --> 00:45:50,660
 But I was born in 1987.

1174
00:45:50,660 --> 00:45:53,420
 So I would have, I kind of been having them when I was a year old.

1175
00:45:53,420 --> 00:45:56,900
 Well, they occasionally bring them back for a very short amount of time.

1176
00:45:56,900 --> 00:46:02,060
 I think in 2012, Wolves did a thing where they asked a lot of people to send in jokes that

1177
00:46:02,060 --> 00:46:05,220
 they were going to print on the sticks and maybe for six months they did it.

1178
00:46:05,220 --> 00:46:06,220
 Right.

1179
00:46:06,220 --> 00:46:07,220
 Yeah.

1180
00:46:07,220 --> 00:46:08,220
 So it comes in and out.

1181
00:46:08,220 --> 00:46:10,220
 But generally speaking, they got phased out in '88.

1182
00:46:10,220 --> 00:46:11,220
 Damn.

1183
00:46:11,220 --> 00:46:13,260
 I've some ice lollies stuff.

1184
00:46:13,260 --> 00:46:15,100
 Did you know that it was invented in Churin?

1185
00:46:15,100 --> 00:46:16,100
 What's it?

1186
00:46:16,100 --> 00:46:17,100
 Yes.

1187
00:46:17,100 --> 00:46:21,860
 Along with Vermouth, Nutella and Ferro Roche, all invented in Churin.

1188
00:46:21,860 --> 00:46:26,180
 In 1937, the chock ice, that was the first, the original ice lollies.

1189
00:46:26,180 --> 00:46:30,940
 It was a good year for sweeties, actually, in 1937 because Maltese's, pop its smarties and

1190
00:46:30,940 --> 00:46:33,100
 rolos were all invented in the same year.

1191
00:46:33,100 --> 00:46:34,100
 Isn't that strange?

1192
00:46:34,100 --> 00:46:37,500
 What was that sort of nexus of sweet inventions?

1193
00:46:37,500 --> 00:46:40,660
 They must have just invented a lot of the machinery.

1194
00:46:40,660 --> 00:46:43,500
 The Canberian explosion.

1195
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:44,500
 The Canberian explosion.

1196
00:46:44,500 --> 00:46:45,500
 Really good.

1197
00:46:45,500 --> 00:46:46,500
 Yeah.

1198
00:46:46,500 --> 00:46:47,500
 Also, you mentioned.

1199
00:46:47,500 --> 00:46:48,500
 So close to being a joke like that.

1200
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:49,500
 Almost.

1201
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:51,260
 No, I really like it.

1202
00:46:51,260 --> 00:46:52,260
 The Canberian explosion.

1203
00:46:52,260 --> 00:46:53,260
 The Canberian explosion.

1204
00:46:53,260 --> 00:46:54,260
 The Canberian explosion.

1205
00:46:54,260 --> 00:46:55,260
 The Canberian explosion.

1206
00:46:55,260 --> 00:46:56,260
 The Canberian explosion.

1207
00:46:56,260 --> 00:46:57,260
 Yeah, it doesn't work.

1208
00:46:57,260 --> 00:46:58,260
 It's so close to a joke.

1209
00:46:58,260 --> 00:46:59,260
 It's very close to a joke.

1210
00:46:59,260 --> 00:47:00,260
 That's my radio show.

1211
00:47:00,260 --> 00:47:02,260
 Welcome to a very close to a joke.

1212
00:47:02,260 --> 00:47:06,860
 So, shall we talk about what we're talking about eating things?

1213
00:47:06,860 --> 00:47:08,860
 I think people eat shipworms.

1214
00:47:08,860 --> 00:47:09,860
 Yeah.

1215
00:47:09,860 --> 00:47:10,860
 Some places.

1216
00:47:10,860 --> 00:47:11,860
 Do they?

1217
00:47:11,860 --> 00:47:12,860
 Yeah.

1218
00:47:12,860 --> 00:47:13,860
 Okay.

1219
00:47:13,860 --> 00:47:14,860
 They don't look nice, but they are delicious.

1220
00:47:14,860 --> 00:47:17,220
 And they are also incredibly nutritious.

1221
00:47:17,220 --> 00:47:22,340
 Shipworms have more protein than beef, as well as being rich in iron, zinc, selenium and

1222
00:47:22,340 --> 00:47:24,140
 vitamin B12.

1223
00:47:24,140 --> 00:47:27,500
 And you said Dan, they're called sometimes the termites of the sea.

1224
00:47:27,500 --> 00:47:28,500
 Yes.

1225
00:47:28,500 --> 00:47:33,460
 And a termite contains twice as much protein as solo in steak.

1226
00:47:33,460 --> 00:47:34,460
 They're...

1227
00:47:34,460 --> 00:47:37,620
 I'm not going to say taking it off, but I think the world's first modern shipworm farm

1228
00:47:37,620 --> 00:47:43,940
 was founded a couple of years ago because they convert Borealwood to very edible protein.

1229
00:47:43,940 --> 00:47:49,860
 But they're so brilliant, because if you're farming salmon, for example, in order for the

1230
00:47:49,860 --> 00:47:53,320
 salmon to have something to do, you've got to collect four times as many tiny fish for

1231
00:47:53,320 --> 00:47:54,320
 this.

1232
00:47:54,320 --> 00:47:59,900
 This is ecologically incredibly damaging fish farming, whereas you just chuck a crappy old

1233
00:47:59,900 --> 00:48:06,620
 log of driftwood into the thing and shipworms eat that, and it's incredibly effective environmentally.

1234
00:48:06,620 --> 00:48:07,620
 Yeah.

1235
00:48:07,620 --> 00:48:08,620
 They grow really fast, as well.

1236
00:48:08,620 --> 00:48:09,620
 And they grow.

1237
00:48:09,620 --> 00:48:10,620
 The shipworms grow.

1238
00:48:10,620 --> 00:48:11,620
 What is it?

1239
00:48:11,620 --> 00:48:12,620
 20 times as fast as muscles.

1240
00:48:12,620 --> 00:48:14,260
 Which, obviously, we all like.

1241
00:48:14,260 --> 00:48:15,900
 Are we eating shipworm food then?

1242
00:48:15,900 --> 00:48:16,900
 Is it out there?

1243
00:48:16,900 --> 00:48:17,900
 Not yet, but it is.

1244
00:48:17,900 --> 00:48:25,380
 These two guys at Cambridge, David Willer and Bizarrelli, a guy called Ruben Shipway, started

1245
00:48:25,380 --> 00:48:29,740
 the thing called the naked clam project, because, as Andy said, they're sort of naked because

1246
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:31,740
 they don't have a shell.

1247
00:48:31,740 --> 00:48:35,980
 And they reckon this is going to solve world malnutrition, because not only they're very

1248
00:48:35,980 --> 00:48:38,180
 nutritious, they're environmentally safe.

1249
00:48:38,180 --> 00:48:42,700
 And they've got this amazing thing is, in the tanks where these shipworms nibbling on the

1250
00:48:42,700 --> 00:48:47,620
 driftwood, they chuck in a few garlic capsules as well, so that you get ready garlic clam.

1251
00:48:47,620 --> 00:48:48,620
 Oh, my God.

1252
00:48:48,620 --> 00:48:49,620
 You know what?

1253
00:48:49,620 --> 00:48:53,780
 Next to my house, not far from my house, there was a restaurant opened where all the food

1254
00:48:53,780 --> 00:48:55,220
 was made out of insects.

1255
00:48:55,220 --> 00:48:56,220
 Oh, yeah?

1256
00:48:56,220 --> 00:48:57,780
 In the last, this was in the last year.

1257
00:48:57,780 --> 00:48:58,780
 Wow.

1258
00:48:58,780 --> 00:49:01,900
 It lasted about three months, because people do not want to eat that shit.

1259
00:49:01,900 --> 00:49:02,900
 Oh, I'm sorry.

1260
00:49:02,900 --> 00:49:03,900
 You must have gone presumably.

1261
00:49:03,900 --> 00:49:04,900
 I wanted to.

1262
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:08,940
 And then by the time I tried to buck it, it was already closed down.

1263
00:49:08,940 --> 00:49:09,940
 But you wonder why not?

1264
00:49:09,940 --> 00:49:16,540
 I mean, one of the many xylophages, along with beavers and woodworm, death watch, beetle,

1265
00:49:16,540 --> 00:49:19,740
 is woodlice, which are wood-eating things.

1266
00:49:19,740 --> 00:49:25,140
 And they are closely related to the, they're not insects, they're crustaceans, and we don't

1267
00:49:25,140 --> 00:49:28,100
 have a problem eating clams or lobsters, but woodlice.

1268
00:49:28,100 --> 00:49:32,620
 Well, it's because it's got louse, lice in the title, but the same with shipworms.

1269
00:49:32,620 --> 00:49:34,380
 If you call them shipworms, people aren't going to want to eat them.

1270
00:49:34,380 --> 00:49:38,420
 If you call them long oyster, yum, yum, yum.

1271
00:49:38,420 --> 00:49:43,580
 Oh, was that thing a scoffier went, a scoffier first one to serve frog's legs.

1272
00:49:43,580 --> 00:49:45,380
 He called them nymphs of the dawn.

1273
00:49:45,380 --> 00:49:46,380
 Brilliant.

1274
00:49:46,380 --> 00:49:48,060
 But we can come up with a good name for shipworms.

1275
00:49:48,060 --> 00:49:49,060
 We can get in on this.

1276
00:49:49,060 --> 00:49:53,660
 When naked clams doesn't do it for me, when one, that doesn't sound, long, soft naked.

1277
00:49:53,660 --> 00:49:54,660
 Yeah.

1278
00:49:54,660 --> 00:49:55,660
 Black bodies.

1279
00:49:55,660 --> 00:49:56,660
 Chocolate willies.

1280
00:49:56,660 --> 00:49:57,660
 Try more of that.

1281
00:49:57,660 --> 00:49:58,660
 No.

1282
00:49:58,660 --> 00:50:01,260
 They already exist.

1283
00:50:01,260 --> 00:50:02,860
 One shipworm we haven't mentioned.

1284
00:50:02,860 --> 00:50:03,860
 Oh, yeah.

1285
00:50:03,860 --> 00:50:04,860
 Giant shipworm.

1286
00:50:04,860 --> 00:50:07,100
 Oh, yes, we must have that in.

1287
00:50:07,100 --> 00:50:09,820
 Kufus polythalamia.

1288
00:50:09,820 --> 00:50:13,060
 It was legendary for a long time, Dan, right up the hill straight.

1289
00:50:13,060 --> 00:50:14,060
 Oh, yeah.

1290
00:50:14,060 --> 00:50:17,260
 And it doesn't live in the sea, so it's a related species, because there are loads of different

1291
00:50:17,260 --> 00:50:18,260
 species of species.

1292
00:50:18,260 --> 00:50:19,260
 Yes.

1293
00:50:19,260 --> 00:50:21,100
 And we've mostly been talking about the one that eats ships, which is one specific species

1294
00:50:21,100 --> 00:50:22,180
 of shipworm.

1295
00:50:22,180 --> 00:50:26,260
 This one lives in mud, and it doesn't barrel into wood.

1296
00:50:26,260 --> 00:50:31,740
 It builds this chalky case around itself, and it can get up to five feet long.

1297
00:50:31,740 --> 00:50:32,740
 Wow.

1298
00:50:32,740 --> 00:50:33,740
 It's so big.

1299
00:50:33,740 --> 00:50:36,180
 It's the same size as Nicki Minaj.

1300
00:50:36,180 --> 00:50:37,180
 Nicki Minaj.

1301
00:50:37,180 --> 00:50:43,940
 And 40 times longer than the smallest monkey with a sofa.

1302
00:50:43,940 --> 00:50:49,540
 But you said Dan, most shipworms are eight to 18 inches long, and this can be five, six

1303
00:50:49,540 --> 00:50:50,540
 feet long.

1304
00:50:50,540 --> 00:50:51,540
 But it doesn't eat wood.

1305
00:50:51,540 --> 00:50:53,180
 That's the weird thing about this shipworm.

1306
00:50:53,180 --> 00:50:54,180
 Yeah, it's bizarre.

1307
00:50:54,180 --> 00:50:57,820
 But basically, it was a team of scientists who found one, and they found it because someone

1308
00:50:57,820 --> 00:51:00,620
 in the Philippines had taken a film of it on YouTube.

1309
00:51:00,620 --> 00:51:03,660
 They'd been searching for it for ages without success, and then someone found it

1310
00:51:03,660 --> 00:51:05,060
 on YouTube, basically.

1311
00:51:05,060 --> 00:51:10,100
 But you can see them pouring it out of its shell or whatever it is, and it's absolutely

1312
00:51:10,100 --> 00:51:11,100
 disgusting.

1313
00:51:11,100 --> 00:51:13,380
 It's really, it's the stuff of nightmares.

1314
00:51:13,380 --> 00:51:14,380
 It's really cool.

1315
00:51:14,380 --> 00:51:16,740
 So if it was called muddy nymphs, would you eat it?

1316
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:17,740
 Yes.

1317
00:51:17,740 --> 00:51:18,740
 Absolutely.

1318
00:51:18,740 --> 00:51:19,740
 12.

1319
00:51:19,740 --> 00:51:20,740
 Yeah.

1320
00:51:20,740 --> 00:51:26,580
 Okay, that's it.

1321
00:51:26,580 --> 00:51:27,820
 That is all of our facts.

1322
00:51:27,820 --> 00:51:28,980
 Thank you so much for listening.

1323
00:51:28,980 --> 00:51:32,060
 If you'd like to get in contact with any of us about the things that we've said over

1324
00:51:32,060 --> 00:51:36,480
 the course of this podcast, we can all be found on our online social media accounts.

1325
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:39,380
 I'm on @Sriberland on Instagram, James.

1326
00:51:39,380 --> 00:51:41,780
 My Instagram is no such thing as James Harkin.

1327
00:51:41,780 --> 00:51:42,780
 And Andy.

1328
00:51:42,780 --> 00:51:44,300
 My name is @AndraHunterRab.

1329
00:51:44,300 --> 00:51:45,620
 John, you're also online?

1330
00:51:45,620 --> 00:51:49,540
 Yes, I'm on Instagram as John Lloyd, QI or one word.

1331
00:51:49,540 --> 00:51:50,540
 Yeah.

1332
00:51:50,540 --> 00:51:51,540
 Very exciting.

1333
00:51:51,540 --> 00:51:54,780
 And just to remind everyone, the meaning of LIF has been reissued.

1334
00:51:54,780 --> 00:51:59,340
 It's the 42nd year, so the meaning of LIF is 42.

1335
00:51:59,340 --> 00:52:00,340
 Yes.

1336
00:52:00,340 --> 00:52:02,020
 And that's in all bookshops now.

1337
00:52:02,020 --> 00:52:03,020
 And online.

1338
00:52:03,020 --> 00:52:04,740
 So get it for Christmas for someone you love.

1339
00:52:04,740 --> 00:52:05,740
 It is for my money.

1340
00:52:05,740 --> 00:52:10,380
 It's the funniest book that's ever been written, John Lloyd and Douglas Adams, the co-writers.

1341
00:52:10,380 --> 00:52:15,460
 Now, also, if you want to send us any facts that you want us to put into our shows, either
