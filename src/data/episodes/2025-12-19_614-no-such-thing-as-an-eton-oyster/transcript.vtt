00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:02.600
 Merry Christmas, everyone!

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:03.840
 Oh, ho, ho!

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:04.600
 Yep.

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:05.880
 [laughter]

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:06.640
 Thanks, Ben.

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:09.640
 Well, as you can see, we are all in the Christmas spirit,

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:13.600
 and why would we not be because we have a very special guest for you here today?

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:18.040
 That's right. It is the man known as the chief gnome of the QI operation.

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:21.720
 He is the person who brought us four, including Anna together,

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.960
 to make no such thing as a fish. It is John Lloyd.

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:27.360
 Yes, the Christ figure to our three wise men.

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:28.320
 Oh, my God.

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:29.840
 Okay. Okay, no.

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:31.720
 I'm, I'm, I'm rowing back.

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:33.880
 He's, uh, he's the producer of QI.

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:36.560
 He's the producer of every great comedy series you watched.

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:39.160
 Black-annish spitting image, not the 9 o'clock news so much.

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:42.280
 And he's the author of a book called The Meaning of Liff,

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:46.280
 co-written with Douglas Adams 42 years ago.

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:48.840
 And it's just been reissued. It's a fantastic book.

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.840
 Yeah, this book is basically a dictionary of things that they should be words for.

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:54.920
 Uh, but they don't exist.

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:59.120
 And so, what they've done is there are signs of place names all around the UK

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:01.040
 that don't have any meaning attached to them.

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:04.160
 And they've attached these observations to those to create new words.

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:05.240
 Like bath?

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:06.520
 Uh, no.

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:08.400
 That means that it already has meaning.

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.440
 Oh, yeah. Yeah, sandwich, for example.

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:14.400
 That, no, no, you guys are screwing this up.

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:15.800
 Demoins?

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:18.840
 The two little lines coming down from your nose to your mouth are the demoins?

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.400
 Ah, nice. I like ealy. That's always been my favorite.

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:25.720
 The first tiniest inkling that's something somewhere has gone terribly wrong.

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:27.320
 Okay, so that's the meaning of Liff.

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:28.840
 It's available in all shops now.

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:33.120
 It's a brilliant Christmas present stocking filler main present, I would say.

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:34.120
 Absolutely.

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:38.040
 But what if you're listening to this, and it's too late to do the shopping,

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.840
 and you need to get the fish lover in your life a gift?

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:43.720
 What to do is get the fish listener in your life.

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:48.240
 Membership of club fish are wonderful, super secret, top secret,

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.680
 but also crucially accessible to everyone on the planet, members club.

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:53.400
 Absolutely. There's loads of things on there.

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:55.280
 There's loads of bonus content.

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:00.320
 There is going to be a super special quiz coming up in the new year that we're going to announce.

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:03.480
 There are extra long versions of our normal episode.

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:08.320
 There is video episodes of Drop Us Align, which is our audience feedback show.

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:12.240
 Go to patreon.com/no such thing as a fish, and you can get your membership there.

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:16.640
 But in the meantime, please enjoy this episode of No Such Thing as a Fish

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:19.640
 with John Lloyd, C-B-E.

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:22.160
 Christ of the British Empire.

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:23.400
 On with the show.

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:44.240
 Hello, and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:47.240
 to you from the QI offices in Hobern.

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:48.240
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:53.480
 I am sitting here with James Harkin, Andrew Hunter Murray, and John Lloyd.

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:57.440
 Once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:01.600
 days, and in a particular order, here we go.

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:04.080
 Starting with fact number one, and that is Andy.

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:09.120
 My fact is, the Chicago River used to be sparkling, but only because of all the animal

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:14.120
 carcasses floating in it.

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:17.680
 How did dead carcasses make something fizzy?

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:19.560
 Well, they give off methane.

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:21.000
 They give off gas.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:27.440
 Basically, there's a bit of the Chicago River, which was called bubbly creek.

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:31.760
 This is actually a good news story from this year, because finally they've cleaned it up.

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:35.360
 But a hundred years ago, it was really foul.

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:36.560
 It was amazing.

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:42.160
 So there's a bit of the Chicago River, which has been full of junk for a century, and

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:46.920
 the reason that it was so bad in that particular bit was because it's next to the Abattoir

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:53.960
 District, the slaughterhouses, all of that, and it was so foul that bits of it were just

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:54.960
 solid at the surface.

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:58.120
 The river was just caked with lumps of matter.

00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:59.120
 Oh, wow.

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:00.120
 So you don't need a bridge?

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:01.120
 No bridge required.

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:02.120
 No, no, no.

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:03.120
 Exactly.

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:04.120
 Really good.

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:05.120
 Chickens could walk on it.

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:06.120
 Could they?

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:07.120
 Completely unharmed.

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:08.120
 Who just wander out of this?

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:11.320
 Chickens can swim, so that doesn't really help them that much, can't they?

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:12.320
 They can.

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:13.320
 They are my thinking of ducks.

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:14.320
 You think of ducks?

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:15.320
 Yeah.

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:22.280
 That's because the reason there were so many carcasses in it is because from 1865 to the 1920s,

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:25.560
 more meat was processed in Chicago than anywhere else in the world.

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:26.560
 No.

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:27.560
 Really?

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:28.560
 Wow.

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:29.560
 And it's a big foodie place.

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:32.000
 I was interested in other kinds of food in Chicago.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.400
 Did you know Shredded Wheat was invented in Chicago?

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:35.400
 No.

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:39.000
 It's premiered at the world's Farron Chicago in 1893 and invented by Henry Perkey.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.000
 Yeah.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.000
 Okay.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:49.000
 And also 31% of children admitted to the University of Chicago Burn Centre over a 10-year period

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.760
 were scalded by instant noodles.

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:51.760
 Oh, wow.

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:52.760
 Wow.

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:53.760
 I've been there.

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:54.760
 To that centre.

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:55.760
 No.

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:58.680
 To the world of scalded hot noodles.

00:04:58.680 --> 00:04:59.680
 Ah.

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:00.680
 Situations.

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:01.680
 Yeah.

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:02.680
 You've got to let those noodles stand.

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:03.680
 Gotta get to them.

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:04.680
 Gotta get straighter to them.

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:08.800
 This, you say sparkling, it didn't look nice, did it, right?

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:10.720
 The bubbles were purely the sparkly elements.

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:11.720
 Yes, it did.

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:12.720
 I'd say rather than sparkling.

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:16.160
 Because I've got some sparkling water here in front of me, it's beautiful and clear.

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:17.160
 Oh, that's lovely.

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:18.160
 Yeah, yeah.

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:21.720
 I put a dead mouse in here before we started just to help it bubble.

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:27.000
 Well, you say, in the bubbly water, though, a liter of bottled water contains an average

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.400
 of 240,000 detectable plastic fragments.

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:31.400
 Oh, dear.

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:32.400
 Oh, right.

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:33.400
 Don't drink that.

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:34.400
 Don't drink that.

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:35.400
 Here's another one, James.

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:39.520
 Well, the bottles can have 40,000 times more bacteria than a toilet seat.

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:42.520
 Oh, well, this isn't real useful, but this is one that I'm going to chuck away into the

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:43.520
 street afterwards.

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:44.520
 Just that.

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:47.000
 I'm going to chuck it into the Thames and see what pops up.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:48.000
 Yeah.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.000
 Can I tell you a thing about bubbles?

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:50.000
 Yes.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:51.000
 Probably water.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:52.000
 Okay.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:57.200
 So London has the ability to spritz its own water.

00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:58.200
 The Thames?

00:05:58.200 --> 00:05:59.200
 The Thames.

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:05.720
 It has two boats, the bubble boats, which can inject gas into the river.

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:07.120
 Is it just for fun?

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:08.120
 It's not.

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:10.840
 It's really important, but it's only occasionally needed, right?

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:16.920
 So when there is really hot weather, and when there are sometimes sewage over spills,

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:20.240
 which mostly won't happen anymore because of the new Big Thames Tideway tunnel, which we've

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:21.400
 talked about, blah, blah, blah.

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:25.680
 But basically, there are times where you just need to inject oxygen into the water so

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:26.680
 fish can breathe.

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:27.680
 I see.

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:29.800
 So there's a sewage overflow.

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:32.640
 That means there's not enough oxygen in there so you need to get some in.

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:33.640
 Exactly.

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:36.080
 And there are two boats, they're called bubbler and vitality.

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:37.600
 It's an absolute last resort.

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:42.300
 You know, if you're using the oxygenate, the water boat, it's a really bad sign, but they

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:47.200
 can each inject 30 tons of oxygen into the river every day.

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:48.200
 That's really cool.

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:53.000
 This is necessary because in 1957, the Thames was declared biologically dead.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:58.100
 And by 1970, it was so polluted, it has started to dissolve the hulls of boats.

00:06:58.100 --> 00:06:59.100
 Wow.

00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:00.100
 It is that toxic.

00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:01.100
 Oh my gosh.

00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:02.100
 Yeah, it's a lot better.

00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:03.100
 I think it's a lot better out here.

00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:08.240
 And it's really interesting because the word Thames means river in Celtic.

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:14.320
 Same as the word "tine" means river from Old English word "tinan", which means to dissolve.

00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:15.320
 Okay.

00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:16.320
 That's nice.

00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:21.560
 It's amazing that we can tell how much oxygen is in the Thames.

00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:24.820
 That's pretty extraordinary that you would take a sample of one spot and that would tell

00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:27.120
 you the story of the entire Thames.

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:28.120
 Yeah, you're right.

00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:29.120
 It just seems quite wild.

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:32.940
 I had this thing quite recently where they put a little finger on your finger and they

00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:34.740
 tell you how much oxygen is in your blood.

00:07:34.740 --> 00:07:35.740
 How the fuck does that work?

00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:36.740
 Yeah.

00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:38.640
 Is it because all your blood goes through your finger at some point or another?

00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:39.640
 No, it can't.

00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:40.640
 Can it?

00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:41.640
 Can it?

00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:42.640
 No, it can't.

00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:43.640
 I mean, that's not how it works.

00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:46.140
 No, because some of the blood goes out to your leg and then back to the heart.

00:07:46.140 --> 00:07:47.140
 Yeah.

00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:48.140
 You know, it's up to your finger and then back to the heart.

00:07:48.140 --> 00:07:49.140
 Yeah.

00:07:49.140 --> 00:07:50.140
 I don't know how it works.

00:07:50.140 --> 00:07:53.880
 And I don't want to know, actually, because I have to think it's magic.

00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:54.880
 Okay.

00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:59.520
 Here's some stuff on corpses and carcasses.

00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:04.360
 Do you know there's a theory that anthrax can lure you in?

00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:05.360
 Oh.

00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:06.360
 Yeah.

00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:10.060
 So the idea is that anthrax gets into an animal.

00:08:10.060 --> 00:08:11.880
 The animal dies.

00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:16.660
 And then the animal sort of fertilises the ground and so it gets more lush.

00:08:16.660 --> 00:08:19.880
 And then that gets more animals to go to it.

00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:24.200
 And then those animals catch the anthrax and then they die.

00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:26.920
 And there's an idea that that's how it's evolved.

00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:27.920
 That's its life cycle.

00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:28.920
 Isn't that cool?

00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:29.920
 Yes.

00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:30.920
 That's very cool.

00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:32.800
 It's so weird that that stuff got out.

00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:38.440
 Well, I guess we've, I make that sound as if it's like the anthrax is going, "Shh, shhh."

00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:41.480
 Like, you know, I've turned it into a human in my mind.

00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:45.400
 You know, we have to anthropomorphize a lot of these facts to make them interesting.

00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:46.400
 Yeah.

00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:50.200
 And the other thing that I found is I went to a place called Padarac in France, it's a big

00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:51.400
 sort of cave.

00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:56.000
 And they said that in the 20th century, in some parts of France, there was a law that if

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:00.200
 your animal got diseased and died, you have to go and throw it into the nearest chasm.

00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:01.200
 Oh, chasm.

00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:03.720
 That's what they called it.

00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:07.920
 Like, to be further one in Padarac is like a big chasm and they thought the devil lived

00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:08.920
 down there and stuff.

00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:12.240
 It was like one of those, you know, it's like a sinkhole kind of...

00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:13.240
 Right, right, right.

00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:17.400
 The problem is that the rivers go underneath these chasms and they're attached to the water

00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:18.400
 supply.

00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:22.800
 So you throw in your anthrax cow or sheep and then it gets into the water and people get

00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:23.800
 sick that way.

00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:24.800
 No, yeah.

00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:25.800
 So it was a misguided law.

00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:27.800
 Is there so many of them are?

00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:28.800
 Question.

00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:29.800
 Yeah.

00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:31.280
 What's the difference between a chasm and a gorge?

00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:32.280
 Oh, well.

00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:40.800
 I would say that a chasm is caused by a collapse of land to make a hole whereas a gorge

00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:42.280
 is caused by a river.

00:09:42.280 --> 00:09:44.720
 Right, so it's like a huge river.

00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:48.320
 A river is like almost like a big, shaped valley caused by a fast flowing river.

00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:49.320
 Yeah.

00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:50.320
 A gorge, sorry.

00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:51.320
 A gorge.

00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:52.320
 Right, right.

00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:53.320
 And a canyon?

00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:54.320
 Same.

00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:55.320
 Same, but bigger.

00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:56.320
 Big river.

00:09:56.320 --> 00:09:57.320
 Canyon is an American gorge.

00:09:57.320 --> 00:09:58.320
 Big river.

00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:00.320
 Do you know what a current bum is?

00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:01.320
 A current bum.

00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:05.760
 A current bum is a rock under the surface of a river, which gives that sort of hump thing.

00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:06.760
 Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:07.760
 What is covered in water?

00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:08.760
 Yeah.

00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:09.760
 The water goes over a boulder.

00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:10.760
 Oh, sure.

00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:12.760
 And how far is that just known?

00:10:12.760 --> 00:10:13.760
 It's actually called.

00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:15.760
 It's a book called Landscape, where Robert McFarlane, which I highly recommend.

00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:16.760
 Right.

00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:18.760
 Right, dialect words all over the country.

00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:19.760
 Very cool.

00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:20.760
 The river is now clean, Andy.

00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:21.760
 You said the Chicago River.

00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:22.760
 Yes.

00:10:22.760 --> 00:10:25.760
 Except, once a year, it looks like toxic goo.

00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:26.760
 Oh.

00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:30.880
 And that's because of some Patrick's day, they die the river, the entire river, green.

00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:31.880
 Lovely.

00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:32.880
 Yeah.

00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:33.880
 Lovely?

00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:34.880
 Well, I celebrate Irish Heritage Shaves.

00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:35.880
 I don't know why you don't.

00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:36.880
 What?

00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:40.520
 Because I add part Irish.

00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:41.520
 But I refuse.

00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:43.640
 I just straight up refuse.

00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:44.640
 What, I don't know what that is.

00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:49.640
 Well, I think the question is, is it okay, like, are they putting in toxic goo, or are they

00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:50.960
 putting in food coloring?

00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:51.960
 Food coloring.

00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:55.800
 They started with toxic goo, and that quickly got speed back.

00:10:55.800 --> 00:11:01.240
 I think they did, because it started by accident in 1961 when some people were putting

00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:06.840
 dye into the water to see where like a leak had come out or to see where the water flowed.

00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:09.000
 And then it was around St. Patrick's Day.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.040
 So everyone thought, oh, they did that on purpose.

00:11:12.040 --> 00:11:14.680
 And they went, oh, we didn't, but let's do it on purpose in future.

00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:16.200
 But that dye was toxic.

00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:17.200
 Ah.

00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:18.200
 There you go.

00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:19.200
 That's very funny.

00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:21.040
 The Chicago River is a friend of the podcast.

00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:22.040
 Yeah.

00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:23.040
 Also, it is.

00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:28.440
 Because in 2004, the Dave Matthews band drove over it in their bus and dumped an estimated

00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:33.680
 800 pounds of human feces onto a passenger sightseeing boat.

00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:34.680
 Oh.

00:11:34.680 --> 00:11:35.680
 Yes.

00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:37.760
 That's a hundred pounds of feces from their bus.

00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:40.000
 They've been saving it up.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:41.000
 The tour bus.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:42.720
 That's a hell of a tour.

00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:43.720
 Was it through a grating?

00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:44.720
 It was through a grating.

00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:45.720
 Yeah.

00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:47.840
 And you imagine being on that boat.

00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:49.720
 Celebrity feces all early.

00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:51.600
 You wouldn't know it was celebrity, though.

00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:53.680
 If you knew it's celebrity, that might take the edge off.

00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:57.120
 Do you think if you saw Dave Matthews waving out the window, you'd go, how lucky are we?

00:11:57.120 --> 00:12:00.720
 I don't think Dave Matthews is of a level of celebrity enough.

00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:01.720
 No.

00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:02.720
 No.

00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:03.720
 I know his face.

00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:05.240
 I'd want it to be a list.

00:12:05.240 --> 00:12:07.080
 He won't tell the Swiss bus traveling.

00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:08.480
 Source of, yeah.

00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:09.480
 Right.

00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:12.080
 That's going to be mixed with Travis Kelsey's carcass.

00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:13.080
 Too much.

00:12:13.080 --> 00:12:18.560
 In the meaning of live, the Chicago is defined as the foul smelling wind that precedes

00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:19.560
 an underground train.

00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:20.560
 Oh.

00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:23.600
 Might, of course, be one of Dave Matthews' fans.

00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:26.320
 But it was known as the Stinking River.

00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:27.560
 Wasn't it the Chicago River?

00:12:27.560 --> 00:12:30.200
 That's what locals called it all the way through the 20th century.

00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:31.200
 It was really.

00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:32.200
 It sounds like it was so bad.

00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:36.040
 And a lot of the contemporary descriptions of how awful it was come from this brilliant

00:12:36.040 --> 00:12:41.440
 book, The Jungle, by a writer called Up to the Sling Claire, who wrote, it was a journalistic

00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:45.760
 exposé, really, of the slaughterhouses and their practices and just how, you know,

00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:48.440
 appalling the quality was there.

00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:51.280
 So I'll just read you a couple of sentences of it.

00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:56.080
 The material brought to the surface was as black as ink, a considerable amount of gas

00:12:56.080 --> 00:13:00.680
 was given off, which was so evil smelling that it could be detected even above the

00:13:00.680 --> 00:13:03.360
 prevailing odour from the stockyard pens.

00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:04.360
 Oh, my God.

00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:05.360
 I know.

00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:11.200
 And sometimes the river would catch fire because it was so, wow, and sometimes people would wander

00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:12.200
 out.

00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:13.200
 I'm presumably chasing your chicken.

00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:14.200
 Yeah.

00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:15.200
 And you try to get it back.

00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:16.200
 And then they just disappear below the surface.

00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:17.720
 Could they get out a bit into it?

00:13:17.720 --> 00:13:21.200
 You mean they could walk over some glove and then disappear at that sense?

00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:22.200
 No.

00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:23.200
 Up to the Sling Claire.

00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:24.200
 Oh, yeah.

00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:25.200
 He was known as like a mucker acre.

00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:29.800
 He wrote fiction that exposed what was going on in society and quite a few laws were

00:13:29.800 --> 00:13:33.200
 changed off the back of different books that he wrote over the course of his life.

00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:34.280
 So he's really important.

00:13:34.280 --> 00:13:39.600
 But I also have a book of his at my house, which is called Mental Radio.

00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:44.680
 And it's a book he wrote all about his experiments with telepathy because his wife Mary believed

00:13:44.680 --> 00:13:46.880
 that she had telepathic abilities.

00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:51.720
 So we're tell these really awesome people getting a bit woo woo towards the end.

00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:52.720
 Yeah.

00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:55.720
 If you look at all these, all the people who invented quantum mechanics, for example,

00:13:55.720 --> 00:14:01.800
 became really mystical towards the end of their life because, you know, Schrodinger.

00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:05.000
 I guess it is kind of like, it's almost like magic, isn't it?

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:06.000
 Quantum.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:07.000
 Yeah, quantum gifts.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:08.000
 Quantum gifts.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:09.000
 Yeah, I think you go.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:12.360
 You once you've done a lifetime of science, you think actually, but why, why is there something

00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:13.360
 and not nothing?

00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:17.320
 Because I've got a friend who was a Nobel Prize winner called Brian Josephson who invented

00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:19.000
 the Josephson Junction.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:20.000
 Oh, yeah.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:25.600
 So it's a super-knocked guy who is basically slightly sent to Coventry in Cambridge because

00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:30.200
 he's become a Buddhist and become very spiritual and he's the most wonderful person.

00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:34.000
 I think in the University of Cambridge, they don't say sent to Coventry, they say sent

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:35.080
 to the University of Warwick.

00:14:35.080 --> 00:14:40.400
 That's very, Schrodinger, but yeah, Albert Einstein wrote it forward to the German edition

00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:42.280
 of Mental Radio, so even he was interested in it.

00:14:42.280 --> 00:14:44.760
 Yeah, so who often, Sinclair, was a very interesting character.

00:14:44.760 --> 00:14:47.440
 Sounds like a good, it's a good name for a radio station.

00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:49.320
 Welcome to Mental Radio.

00:14:49.320 --> 00:14:53.080
 It's no music, it's just Prince.

00:14:53.080 --> 00:14:54.080
 That's it.

00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:56.520
 Steve Pank, Walter Walls, Steve Pank.

00:14:56.520 --> 00:14:59.640
 But the thing about celebrity, I'm slightly telepathic.

00:14:59.640 --> 00:15:00.640
 Oh, here we go.

00:15:00.640 --> 00:15:05.160
 I can do, there's an online site where you can do, I get scores way, way way above chance.

00:15:05.160 --> 00:15:06.160
 Right.

00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:09.640
 It's that you have to guess where a thing is under a hidden map as it is.

00:15:09.640 --> 00:15:12.920
 That's called My Sweeper, isn't it?

00:15:12.920 --> 00:15:16.480
 I'm actually getting telepathic messages right now from Andy and James Sinclair and what

00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:19.800
 the fuck have you done to our podcast by introducing this subject?

00:15:19.800 --> 00:15:20.800
 Can you hear it?

00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:30.800
 Okay, it is time for fact number two and that is My Fact.

00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:35.800
 My Fact this week is that in Hawaii, a tightly guarded secret that used to be passed down

00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:40.480
 from generation to generation was how people used to tune their guitars.

00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:41.480
 Sorry.

00:15:41.480 --> 00:15:45.920
 Surely everyone knows that, there's little knobs aren't there on the end.

00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:47.680
 We'll see what I tell you, dude.

00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:49.080
 I don't know how to tune a guitar.

00:15:49.080 --> 00:15:53.080
 Honestly, if we left you in a room with a guitar, you'd work it out pretty fast.

00:15:53.080 --> 00:15:55.160
 If you'd say those knobs, they'd sound changes.

00:15:55.160 --> 00:15:59.320
 Well, I know you turn the knobs, but I don't know, I'm very impressed when I see anyone

00:15:59.320 --> 00:16:00.320
 do it.

00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:01.600
 And also you shouldn't be.

00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:03.600
 You wouldn't know what you were tuning it to, right?

00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:04.600
 Oh, that's it.

00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:05.600
 That's the thing.

00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:11.000
 So a guitar, if you play a classical guitar, like I would tune a guitar or maybe James would

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:15.600
 tune a guitar, you're tuning is E-A-D-G-B-E, that's sort of the classic.

00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:19.680
 And you can make classic E notes, G notes, all that, it's basic stuff, if you don't understand

00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:20.680
 that at all, do we?

00:16:20.680 --> 00:16:21.680
 No.

00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:25.680
 If you tune it that way, that means wherever you put your fingers on the guitar, it will always

00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:26.680
 sound the same.

00:16:26.680 --> 00:16:27.680
 Yeah.

00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:29.680
 And you just know where to put them, because you know how each one is.

00:16:29.680 --> 00:16:30.680
 Okay.

00:16:30.680 --> 00:16:31.680
 Okay.

00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:32.680
 Child deserves fun.

00:16:32.680 --> 00:16:33.680
 What happened?

00:16:33.680 --> 00:16:34.680
 Is that what it is?

00:16:34.680 --> 00:16:35.680
 Oh, that's the staves of a musical score, isn't it?

00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:37.080
 Oh, every good boy deserves favor?

00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:38.080
 That's it, yes.

00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:39.080
 Yeah.

00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:40.080
 Yeah.

00:16:40.080 --> 00:16:43.160
 But this is very interesting, because this is slack key guitar in Hawaii.

00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:49.560
 It's a Hawaiian guitar tradition that has been part of their world for hundreds of years.

00:16:49.560 --> 00:16:56.480
 And the idea is that they all tune it differently to an open set of notes.

00:16:56.480 --> 00:17:00.540
 When you then play it as an open chord, so you don't use your other hand, it plays a lovely

00:17:00.540 --> 00:17:01.540
 in chord.

00:17:01.540 --> 00:17:07.520
 And every family seemed to have designed its own different set of notes unique to them.

00:17:07.520 --> 00:17:10.160
 And that's what would be passed down from family to family.

00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:14.360
 Now the reason that this happened is almost to do with what you were saying, Andy.

00:17:14.360 --> 00:17:20.020
 So when Captain Cook first came to Hawaii, there was a guy on board called Captain Vancouver

00:17:20.020 --> 00:17:23.200
 who was the captain of the next vote that came to Hawaii.

00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:27.200
 And he brought a bunch of cattle, and the cattle arrived and it was roaming around.

00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:29.400
 And the king of Hawaii didn't know what to do with them.

00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:30.400
 Well, there's this guy.

00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:32.840
 Oh, this is the origin story of the guitar in Hawaii.

00:17:32.840 --> 00:17:33.840
 It's really interesting.

00:17:33.840 --> 00:17:38.720
 Now, in those days in Hawaii, we always tied that idea to our balance.

00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:40.720
 [laughs]

00:17:40.720 --> 00:17:42.200
 Cattles roving free in Hawaii.

00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:43.200
 They don't know what to do.

00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:47.960
 So they decided to bring in some Mexican and Spanish cowboys to teach them how to farm.

00:17:47.960 --> 00:17:48.960
 The hells!

00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:49.960
 Yes, exactly.

00:17:49.960 --> 00:17:50.960
 They brought their guitars.

00:17:50.960 --> 00:17:52.200
 They played the guitars.

00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:55.100
 And then when they left, they left them the guitars.

00:17:55.100 --> 00:17:58.220
 After a while, a bunch of them went, "How do we even tune these things?"

00:17:58.220 --> 00:18:00.400
 And they weren't quite sure the classical tunings.

00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:02.000
 So they had to create their own tunings.

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:04.280
 And family by family, this is what they did.

00:18:04.280 --> 00:18:06.200
 And all these beautiful songs started emerging.

00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:10.480
 Dan, you sent down a link like we always do with these facts just so that we can check

00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:12.280
 that they're true.

00:18:12.280 --> 00:18:13.280
 And we all do it.

00:18:13.280 --> 00:18:14.280
 We all do it.

00:18:14.280 --> 00:18:15.280
 We all do it.

00:18:15.280 --> 00:18:16.280
 We all do it.

00:18:16.280 --> 00:18:17.280
 We all do it.

00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:18.280
 We all do it.

00:18:18.280 --> 00:18:19.280
 I mean, this idea came about because of Dan's rights.

00:18:19.280 --> 00:18:20.280
 But we all do it.

00:18:20.280 --> 00:18:21.280
 Yeah, yeah.

00:18:21.280 --> 00:18:23.960
 And this was about a guy called Raymond Cane.

00:18:23.960 --> 00:18:28.520
 But he has a middle name that I wonder if he read his middle name.

00:18:28.520 --> 00:18:29.520
 Oh, yes, I did.

00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:30.520
 Yeah.

00:18:30.520 --> 00:18:31.920
 Well, you're so good at pronouncing things, Dan.

00:18:31.920 --> 00:18:34.880
 I wonder if he'd like to just remind us what his middle name is.

00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:35.880
 Oh, my God.

00:18:35.880 --> 00:18:36.880
 Yeah.

00:18:36.880 --> 00:18:37.880
 It's just there.

00:18:37.880 --> 00:18:38.880
 Oh, OK.

00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:41.320
 Well, this is going to be embarrassing for you because as it turns out, this is my middle name

00:18:41.320 --> 00:18:42.320
 as well.

00:18:42.320 --> 00:18:49.640
 So it's Cali o aloha poina alle o hele manu.

00:18:49.640 --> 00:18:50.640
 No, hele manu.

00:18:50.640 --> 00:18:52.840
 Oh, he's got so close.

00:18:52.840 --> 00:18:54.640
 So doing the Australian.

00:18:54.640 --> 00:18:59.400
 Do you know Alan Davis and I went to see the Swedish version of QI years ago.

00:18:59.400 --> 00:19:00.400
 Oh, yeah.

00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:05.080
 And as the producer, very sweetly said, John, it's such an honor to have you here as the

00:19:05.080 --> 00:19:10.080
 director of the whole thing that we, it's, you know, would you kindly introduce the guests

00:19:10.080 --> 00:19:14.840
 and you gave me the list of Swedish guests and I read them all out and they're audience

00:19:14.840 --> 00:19:15.840
 were in his steering.

00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:18.120
 I didn't get one syllable right.

00:19:18.120 --> 00:19:19.920
 They were screaming.

00:19:19.920 --> 00:19:22.560
 Who was Raymond Cane?

00:19:22.560 --> 00:19:23.560
 He was.

00:19:23.560 --> 00:19:24.560
 Good question.

00:19:24.560 --> 00:19:25.720
 He was a slack key guitarist.

00:19:25.720 --> 00:19:26.720
 OK.

00:19:26.720 --> 00:19:29.360
 And I think the thing you sent around was no bit tree of him.

00:19:29.360 --> 00:19:30.360
 It was.

00:19:30.360 --> 00:19:31.360
 Yeah, that's right.

00:19:31.360 --> 00:19:34.000
 I don't play the guitar at all, but I do play a bit of piano.

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:35.000
 Yep.

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:39.760
 And obviously one thing I know is about pianos where middle C is, but I didn't know and

00:19:39.760 --> 00:19:40.760
 this is the most interesting thing.

00:19:40.760 --> 00:19:46.320
 I think I found out in the whole month is there are three middle C's on the guitar.

00:19:46.320 --> 00:19:48.720
 Did you, did you work that out yourself when you were tuning it?

00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:53.520
 If you're tuning on your own, you'll use your lowest E string as a guide to the next

00:19:53.520 --> 00:19:54.920
 string because you can play all the chords.

00:19:54.920 --> 00:19:57.760
 I do the other way from the highest E string onto the next one.

00:19:57.760 --> 00:19:58.760
 Right.

00:19:58.760 --> 00:19:59.760
 So what you, what you do is you find.

00:19:59.760 --> 00:20:00.760
 But do you know where middle C is?

00:20:00.760 --> 00:20:01.760
 Yeah.

00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:02.760
 OK.

00:20:02.760 --> 00:20:03.760
 Name it.

00:20:03.760 --> 00:20:04.760
 OK.

00:20:04.760 --> 00:20:05.760
 First.

00:20:05.760 --> 00:20:06.760
 First.

00:20:06.760 --> 00:20:07.760
 First of the second string.

00:20:07.760 --> 00:20:08.760
 Fifth of the third string.

00:20:08.760 --> 00:20:09.760
 And tenth of the fourth string.

00:20:09.760 --> 00:20:11.600
 I don't know what any of those things mean.

00:20:11.600 --> 00:20:12.600
 OK.

00:20:12.600 --> 00:20:13.600
 This is also why the quiz failed.

00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:15.600
 You give the artist before the person gets the guess.

00:20:15.600 --> 00:20:16.600
 Oh, yeah, yeah.

00:20:16.600 --> 00:20:18.120
 But then I'm allowed to say.

00:20:18.120 --> 00:20:20.360
 I'm allowed to say, yeah, I do all that.

00:20:20.360 --> 00:20:21.880
 I get the point.

00:20:21.880 --> 00:20:23.600
 I'm trade secrets in music.

00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:24.600
 Oh, yeah.

00:20:24.600 --> 00:20:25.600
 As this is a bit of a trade secret.

00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:26.600
 Yeah.

00:20:26.600 --> 00:20:28.360
 How these Hawaiian families kept their guitars.

00:20:28.360 --> 00:20:34.400
 That is proof legally that an album can be a trade secret.

00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:35.400
 What does that mean?

00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:36.400
 OK.

00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:38.800
 Have you heard of the Wuteng clan show?

00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:39.800
 Oh, yeah.

00:20:39.800 --> 00:20:40.800
 I've seen them.

00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:41.800
 I saw them in Aspen, Colorado.

00:20:41.800 --> 00:20:42.800
 Amazing.

00:20:42.800 --> 00:20:46.360
 Why do you used to be in the Wuteng club?

00:20:46.360 --> 00:20:47.360
 The Lizzer.

00:20:47.360 --> 00:20:48.360
 Yeah.

00:20:48.360 --> 00:20:49.840
 This is one of the most amazing things.

00:20:49.840 --> 00:20:50.840
 Imagine you're at a Wuteng gig.

00:20:50.840 --> 00:20:53.440
 You turn around and John Lloyd and Rowan Atkinston.

00:20:53.440 --> 00:20:55.760
 Mr. Bean is standing at a Wuteng kind.

00:20:55.760 --> 00:20:56.760
 Yeah.

00:20:56.760 --> 00:20:57.760
 That's what you went to, right?

00:20:57.760 --> 00:20:57.760
 Yeah.

00:20:57.760 --> 00:20:58.760
 Yeah.

00:20:58.760 --> 00:21:02.240
 So is this about the time when they released one record?

00:21:02.240 --> 00:21:03.240
 One record.

00:21:03.240 --> 00:21:04.240
 Yes.

00:21:04.240 --> 00:21:10.000
 They released, they recorded a secret album in 2007 and they made one hard copy of it.

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:13.080
 So it doesn't exist outside this hard copy of it.

00:21:13.080 --> 00:21:15.800
 And an American, a wealthy American guy called Martin Shrekley.

00:21:15.800 --> 00:21:16.800
 Super controversial.

00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:17.800
 Yeah.

00:21:17.800 --> 00:21:18.800
 Super controversial.

00:21:18.800 --> 00:21:19.800
 Yeah.

00:21:19.800 --> 00:21:20.800
 Super controversial.

00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:21.800
 Yeah.

00:21:21.800 --> 00:21:22.800
 Super controversial.

00:21:22.800 --> 00:21:23.800
 He bought it for $2 million.

00:21:23.800 --> 00:21:25.680
 And there were very strict restrictions on how it could be played or reproduced for all

00:21:25.680 --> 00:21:28.360
 of that for the next 90 odd years.

00:21:28.360 --> 00:21:32.200
 Eventually, in unrelated reasons, he was sent to prison for fraud.

00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:33.200
 No, no, no.

00:21:33.200 --> 00:21:38.000
 I think they might have been slightly related to the fact that he had 2 million quid to spend

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:39.000
 on one record.

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:40.000
 Okay.

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:41.000
 So that's very true.

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:42.000
 Yeah.

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:43.000
 Yeah.

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:44.000
 Yeah.

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:45.000
 I think, just for the...

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:46.000
 No, you're absolutely right.

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:47.000
 Just for the lion's listening.

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:50.440
 So as part of that deal, he, as part of him going to prison for fraud, the album had to be

00:21:50.440 --> 00:21:51.440
 sold off, right?

00:21:51.440 --> 00:21:55.800
 And it got sold off to a crypto firm called Pleasardau.

00:21:55.800 --> 00:22:00.160
 And then when Shrekley got out, nonetheless, despite the album having been sold off, he started

00:22:00.160 --> 00:22:02.160
 playing it for loads of people online.

00:22:02.160 --> 00:22:03.160
 Yeah.

00:22:03.160 --> 00:22:04.160
 And the crypto firm sued him.

00:22:04.160 --> 00:22:08.440
 And all of this led to a judge decreeing that an album can be technically a tried secret.

00:22:08.440 --> 00:22:09.440
 Yeah.

00:22:09.440 --> 00:22:12.280
 I've got two secrets from the meaning of Liff, two secrety words.

00:22:12.280 --> 00:22:13.280
 Oh, cool.

00:22:13.280 --> 00:22:18.520
 Mary Tavi, which you probably know is a place in Devon, a Mary Tavi is a person to whom

00:22:18.520 --> 00:22:24.240
 under dire injunctions of silence, you tell a secret you wish to be far more widely known.

00:22:24.240 --> 00:22:25.240
 Lovely.

00:22:25.240 --> 00:22:26.240
 Useful one.

00:22:26.240 --> 00:22:32.680
 And Tuky Tuky, which is a place in New Zealand, Tuky Tuky is a sexual liaison, which is meant

00:22:32.680 --> 00:22:35.440
 to be secret, but which is, in fact, common knowledge.

00:22:35.440 --> 00:22:37.440
 That's a nice word.

00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:38.440
 Chartres.

00:22:38.440 --> 00:22:39.440
 Oh, yeah.

00:22:39.440 --> 00:22:40.440
 Drink?

00:22:40.440 --> 00:22:41.440
 Yes.

00:22:41.440 --> 00:22:42.440
 Green.

00:22:42.440 --> 00:22:43.440
 Yeah.

00:22:43.440 --> 00:22:44.440
 The recipe is only known by two monks.

00:22:44.440 --> 00:22:45.440
 No.

00:22:45.440 --> 00:22:46.440
 Apparently so.

00:22:46.440 --> 00:22:47.440
 Really?

00:22:47.440 --> 00:22:48.440
 Yeah.

00:22:48.440 --> 00:22:51.880
 Tuky Kola one famously is bit secret.

00:22:51.880 --> 00:22:54.280
 You know, they use Chartres to die the Chicago ribbon?

00:22:54.280 --> 00:22:55.280
 Of course that's not.

00:22:55.280 --> 00:22:56.280
 Yeah.

00:22:56.280 --> 00:22:58.760
 That's where the fish are so cheerful all the time.

00:22:58.760 --> 00:22:59.760
 Yeah.

00:22:59.760 --> 00:23:00.760
 The Coca-Cola one's really interesting.

00:23:00.760 --> 00:23:06.440
 So they have like a secret formula, which they say, oh, no one can work out what this

00:23:06.440 --> 00:23:07.440
 is and all that.

00:23:07.440 --> 00:23:09.960
 And actually, you can kind of pretty easily work out what it is.

00:23:09.960 --> 00:23:14.920
 But obviously Pepsi has the same thing because they make arguably the same drink.

00:23:14.920 --> 00:23:17.600
 I know they slightly taste different, but they're pretty much the same thing.

00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:20.040
 But why do they not have secret ingredients?

00:23:20.040 --> 00:23:23.920
 Like they don't say, oh, we have a secret thing called 7x that nobody knows about.

00:23:23.920 --> 00:23:24.920
 Yeah.

00:23:24.920 --> 00:23:27.400
 Because no one really likes Pepsi.

00:23:27.400 --> 00:23:28.400
 No.

00:23:28.400 --> 00:23:29.400
 Is that it?

00:23:29.400 --> 00:23:30.400
 No.

00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:33.400
 Because I think you'll find that the advertising campaign in the 90s showed that everyone

00:23:33.400 --> 00:23:35.520
 loves Pepsi.

00:23:35.520 --> 00:23:36.520
 And today we're sponsored.

00:23:36.520 --> 00:23:37.520
 No.

00:23:37.520 --> 00:23:38.520
 Yeah.

00:23:38.520 --> 00:23:44.480
 Basically, they just use normal law and just make people sign non-disclosure agreements.

00:23:44.480 --> 00:23:48.760
 And if they give the secrets away, they sue them and stuff rather than saying that they have

00:23:48.760 --> 00:23:51.160
 some sort of secret ingredient that no one can know.

00:23:51.160 --> 00:23:58.720
 Because it does seem mad that you can keep like with so much regulation and all the warnings

00:23:58.720 --> 00:23:59.720
 on the back of a packet.

00:23:59.720 --> 00:24:01.640
 We can just have a secret sauce in there.

00:24:01.640 --> 00:24:06.160
 You have to sort of, I think you have to register it somewhere, but it's accepted legally as

00:24:06.160 --> 00:24:07.160
 a trade secret.

00:24:07.160 --> 00:24:08.160
 That's the thing.

00:24:08.160 --> 00:24:09.160
 Got it.

00:24:09.160 --> 00:24:10.160
 So it is a special legal framework.

00:24:10.160 --> 00:24:13.280
 It's got an injunction on it, basically, kind of.

00:24:13.280 --> 00:24:14.280
 But there is a thing.

00:24:14.280 --> 00:24:15.280
 Okay.

00:24:15.280 --> 00:24:16.280
 It's our age for nilla, cinnamon, and...

00:24:16.280 --> 00:24:17.280
 Don't say the five.

00:24:17.280 --> 00:24:18.920
 Don't say the one or the one.

00:24:18.920 --> 00:24:20.760
 And dead animals.

00:24:20.760 --> 00:24:25.840
 Well, we had an email from listener Esther Nelken who says, "You may have covered this

00:24:25.840 --> 00:24:26.840
 previously."

00:24:26.840 --> 00:24:28.040
 We haven't covered this previously.

00:24:28.040 --> 00:24:33.480
 But in order for Coca-Cola to be recognised as kosher, a rabbi had to be told the secret

00:24:33.480 --> 00:24:38.880
 formula in 1935, rabbi Tobias Geffen signed an NDA and was allowed to investigate the

00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:39.880
 ingredients.

00:24:39.880 --> 00:24:40.880
 Wow.

00:24:40.880 --> 00:24:43.920
 And she adds, "I couldn't find who the rabbi is today who holds the information."

00:24:43.920 --> 00:24:48.000
 That's a damn brown novel waiting to be written, isn't it?

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:49.000
 So right.

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:50.000
 You're so right.

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:53.120
 I've got some specifically Hawaiian secrets here.

00:24:53.120 --> 00:24:54.120
 Oh, cool.

00:24:54.120 --> 00:24:58.960
 That physicist at the University of Hawaii have recently solved the problem, the secret of

00:24:58.960 --> 00:25:02.120
 how washing machines get clothes clean.

00:25:02.120 --> 00:25:03.760
 It's never been known until now.

00:25:03.760 --> 00:25:04.760
 Wow.

00:25:04.760 --> 00:25:08.360
 So there are now two physicists who know the secret of how that works.

00:25:08.360 --> 00:25:11.920
 And the other one is that 2018 was a bad year for Hawaii.

00:25:11.920 --> 00:25:15.240
 They had a massive volcanic explosion.

00:25:15.240 --> 00:25:20.200
 And the authorities warned people not to toast marshmallows over it, which was a very

00:25:20.200 --> 00:25:21.200
 good advice.

00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:27.040
 But they also had in 2018, 38 minutes of panic, after a wrongly pressed button set off an

00:25:27.040 --> 00:25:30.720
 alert warning of an incoming ballistic missile attack.

00:25:30.720 --> 00:25:31.720
 Wow.

00:25:31.720 --> 00:25:35.880
 And the way it's connected with secret is the governor of Hawaii couldn't correct the

00:25:35.880 --> 00:25:40.560
 false missile alert for 17 minutes because he didn't know how to log on to his own Twitter

00:25:40.560 --> 00:25:42.560
 and Facebook accounts.

00:25:42.560 --> 00:25:43.560
 Wow.

00:25:43.560 --> 00:25:44.560
 They were kept from him.

00:25:44.560 --> 00:25:48.520
 Well, only one rabbi in Hawaii knew what the password was.

00:25:48.520 --> 00:25:50.320
 That was mad, wasn't it, when that happened?

00:25:50.320 --> 00:25:51.320
 Yeah.

00:25:51.320 --> 00:25:55.000
 I think a lot of people just started going round telling, you know, telling people about

00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:57.360
 the secretly A-zons and stuff like that because of all of them.

00:25:57.360 --> 00:25:58.360
 Dookie dookie.

00:25:58.360 --> 00:25:59.840
 It's the end of the world.

00:25:59.840 --> 00:26:02.480
 We did it in the book that we were writing the books of the year at the time and there

00:26:02.480 --> 00:26:04.480
 was definitely an article about that.

00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:05.480
 Yes.

00:26:05.480 --> 00:26:09.640
 And I think it's, I think it was the second time that the person who accidentally sent

00:26:09.640 --> 00:26:11.560
 the alert out had made this mistake.

00:26:11.560 --> 00:26:15.760
 And it was, it was something stupid, like there were two buttons next to each other.

00:26:15.760 --> 00:26:17.680
 It was, I think it was a drop down menu.

00:26:17.680 --> 00:26:18.680
 That's right.

00:26:18.680 --> 00:26:23.280
 And it was a drop down menu and it was send nuclear alert brackets test or send out of office

00:26:23.280 --> 00:26:24.280
 reply.

00:26:24.280 --> 00:26:25.280
 Yeah.

00:26:25.280 --> 00:26:33.480
 Okay, it is time for fact number three.

00:26:33.480 --> 00:26:34.480
 That is James.

00:26:34.480 --> 00:26:40.560
 Okay, my fact this week is that in 1874, the world's largest pearl got lost down the back

00:26:40.560 --> 00:26:42.560
 of a sofa.

00:26:42.560 --> 00:26:46.880
 And was this a kind of princess on the P-style situation?

00:26:46.880 --> 00:26:47.880
 Expand.

00:26:47.880 --> 00:26:50.040
 Well, yeah, easy.

00:26:50.040 --> 00:26:51.040
 Okay.

00:26:51.040 --> 00:26:54.560
 They kept putting cushions on top of the sofa.

00:26:54.560 --> 00:26:55.560
 Yeah.

00:26:55.560 --> 00:26:58.280
 And it was only found when, I can't remember the original fairy tale now, is it the true

00:26:58.280 --> 00:27:02.560
 princess can identify the world's largest pearl down the back of a sofa?

00:27:02.560 --> 00:27:03.560
 Is it James?

00:27:03.560 --> 00:27:04.560
 It's not that.

00:27:04.560 --> 00:27:05.560
 It's not that.

00:27:05.560 --> 00:27:10.040
 It's not that complete misrememberance of a fairy story.

00:27:10.040 --> 00:27:11.040
 Anyone else?

00:27:11.040 --> 00:27:15.160
 No, this is something I read in BBC History magazine.

00:27:15.160 --> 00:27:22.800
 It was an article by Kate Williams and it's about the La Peregrina pearl and sofa in Windsor

00:27:22.800 --> 00:27:27.840
 Castle and how the two things interacted in 1874.

00:27:27.840 --> 00:27:33.400
 And it was a woman called the Duchess of Abacorn who was at a party with her husband

00:27:33.400 --> 00:27:39.480
 James Hamilton and she momentarily lost a pearl down the back of the sofa but it was enough

00:27:39.480 --> 00:27:41.960
 that it was recorded and we now know about it.

00:27:41.960 --> 00:27:48.360
 Is it such a massive pearl that it would seriously damage the sofa?

00:27:48.360 --> 00:27:49.360
 No.

00:27:49.360 --> 00:27:50.360
 How big is it?

00:27:50.360 --> 00:27:52.360
 Would you feel a lump if you sat down on it?

00:27:52.360 --> 00:27:53.360
 That's what I'm trying to think.

00:27:53.360 --> 00:27:54.360
 Like the princess and the P.

00:27:54.360 --> 00:27:56.360
 Oh, I was thinking more of the current buns.

00:27:56.360 --> 00:27:57.360
 Current buns, yeah, true.

00:27:57.360 --> 00:27:58.360
 Yeah.

00:27:58.360 --> 00:28:02.200
 If you sat directly onto it with no sofa involved, you would feel it on your bum.

00:28:02.200 --> 00:28:03.200
 Yeah, sure.

00:28:03.200 --> 00:28:09.760
 In the sofa, I don't think so because it is about 11.2 grams in weight, which is about the

00:28:09.760 --> 00:28:13.920
 same weight as a world's smallest monkey.

00:28:13.920 --> 00:28:17.040
 If you sat on the world's smallest monkey, would you feel that?

00:28:17.040 --> 00:28:18.040
 You'd feel it, but not this.

00:28:18.040 --> 00:28:19.040
 It's like a cushion.

00:28:19.040 --> 00:28:22.560
 You'd feel it for sure, but not necessarily if it was inside a sofa.

00:28:22.560 --> 00:28:25.360
 And can you give us a size rather than the weight?

00:28:25.360 --> 00:28:28.720
 No, I'm afraid I can give you more versions of the weight.

00:28:28.720 --> 00:28:36.120
 So it was 55.95 carrots, four ounces or 223.8 grains.

00:28:36.120 --> 00:28:41.320
 How long was this this very large or small weight and with a certain weight?

00:28:41.320 --> 00:28:42.320
 How long was it lost for?

00:28:42.320 --> 00:28:45.320
 It was lost, momentarily.

00:28:45.320 --> 00:28:47.520
 This is a fascinating fact.

00:28:47.520 --> 00:28:48.520
 It was weight.

00:28:48.520 --> 00:28:49.520
 I've lost my glasses.

00:28:49.520 --> 00:28:51.520
 No, there they are on my head.

00:28:51.520 --> 00:28:55.520
 It was interesting enough that Kate Williams wrote about a BBC history magazine.

00:28:55.520 --> 00:28:58.680
 What I think of the most interesting thing is how small monkeys get these.

00:28:58.680 --> 00:28:59.680
 I'm staggered.

00:28:59.680 --> 00:29:02.440
 An adult monkey that weighs 11 grams.

00:29:02.440 --> 00:29:03.440
 Have you seen those monkeys?

00:29:03.440 --> 00:29:06.640
 There's like these monkeys that you put them on your finger and they just hold on like

00:29:06.640 --> 00:29:07.640
 a baby baby.

00:29:07.640 --> 00:29:08.640
 That's a toy.

00:29:08.640 --> 00:29:09.640
 No, you do.

00:29:09.640 --> 00:29:10.640
 They do exist.

00:29:10.640 --> 00:29:11.640
 That's incredible.

00:29:11.640 --> 00:29:12.640
 That's incredible.

00:29:12.640 --> 00:29:13.640
 It is incredible.

00:29:13.640 --> 00:29:17.480
 I think why it's notable is that this is not just any ordinary pearl.

00:29:17.480 --> 00:29:19.840
 It's not just that it was the world largest at the time.

00:29:19.840 --> 00:29:21.080
 This is La Peregrina.

00:29:21.080 --> 00:29:22.080
 Yeah.

00:29:22.080 --> 00:29:23.080
 I said that.

00:29:23.080 --> 00:29:24.080
 This is the wonderer.

00:29:24.080 --> 00:29:28.680
 This is a pearl that has been part of so much history.

00:29:28.680 --> 00:29:31.360
 You can see it in the portraits of Mary Tudor.

00:29:31.360 --> 00:29:33.040
 She was wearing this pearl.

00:29:33.040 --> 00:29:37.680
 It made it all all the way into the modern day to Elizabeth Taylor who wore it in two movies.

00:29:37.680 --> 00:29:39.520
 It's just had this amazing history.

00:29:39.520 --> 00:29:41.800
 The idea that you could lose this at all.

00:29:41.800 --> 00:29:42.800
 I know.

00:29:42.800 --> 00:29:48.480
 Just to say on Elizabeth Taylor, she got given it by Richard Burton, her husband a couple

00:29:48.480 --> 00:29:49.480
 of times.

00:29:49.480 --> 00:29:57.800
 And she lost it in a dog's mouth again momentarily and the pearl was the same size on both

00:29:57.800 --> 00:29:58.800
 occasions.

00:29:58.800 --> 00:30:04.240
 But yeah, she lost it and she was really worried because this was a very iconic piece of

00:30:04.240 --> 00:30:05.240
 jewelry.

00:30:05.240 --> 00:30:09.480
 And she looked in her dog's mouth and there it was extraordinary.

00:30:09.480 --> 00:30:10.480
 So pearls.

00:30:10.480 --> 00:30:11.480
 Oh, yeah.

00:30:11.480 --> 00:30:12.480
 Famous pearls.

00:30:12.480 --> 00:30:13.480
 This one's called La Peregrina.

00:30:13.480 --> 00:30:14.480
 Right?

00:30:14.480 --> 00:30:15.480
 Yeah.

00:30:15.480 --> 00:30:20.720
 It's another incredibly famous pearl called La Peregrina.

00:30:20.720 --> 00:30:21.720
 Oh my gosh.

00:30:21.720 --> 00:30:22.720
 No.

00:30:22.720 --> 00:30:23.720
 It's so weird.

00:30:23.720 --> 00:30:24.720
 And this one is also one of the most storied pearls.

00:30:24.720 --> 00:30:29.840
 This one's been through France, maybe Louis XVI, it was involved in the October revolution

00:30:29.840 --> 00:30:31.760
 in Russia, not in a key role.

00:30:31.760 --> 00:30:32.760
 What is that?

00:30:32.760 --> 00:30:33.760
 La Grina mean.

00:30:33.760 --> 00:30:36.560
 Because Peregrina means a female pilgrim presumed, isn't it?

00:30:36.560 --> 00:30:39.440
 Peregrina is the wandering one, isn't it?

00:30:39.440 --> 00:30:40.440
 Yeah.

00:30:40.440 --> 00:30:41.440
 And I don't wonder.

00:30:41.440 --> 00:30:42.440
 La Peregrina.

00:30:42.440 --> 00:30:44.040
 I haven't actually written down the meaning of it.

00:30:44.040 --> 00:30:45.040
 I don't know.

00:30:45.040 --> 00:30:46.680
 Isn't it bottled water, isn't it?

00:30:46.680 --> 00:30:47.680
 Peregrina, isn't it?

00:30:47.680 --> 00:30:49.680
 It's a female bottled water.

00:30:49.680 --> 00:30:50.680
 That's it.

00:30:50.680 --> 00:30:51.680
 That's it.

00:30:51.680 --> 00:30:52.680
 Yeah.

00:30:52.680 --> 00:30:57.960
 So you know how mollusks of all sorts make pearls.

00:30:57.960 --> 00:30:58.960
 Yeah.

00:30:58.960 --> 00:30:59.920
 A lot of all sorts, a few specific sorts.

00:30:59.920 --> 00:31:04.760
 So what is it like they get a bit of grit in them and they put something around it or

00:31:04.760 --> 00:31:05.760
 something?

00:31:05.760 --> 00:31:06.760
 Yeah.

00:31:06.760 --> 00:31:10.760
 The main idea is that pearls form around a grain of sand or a bit of grit.

00:31:10.760 --> 00:31:16.440
 In fact, it's almost always a parasitic worm that gets inside the muscle or the oyster

00:31:16.440 --> 00:31:17.440
 or whatever.

00:31:17.440 --> 00:31:18.440
 I know.

00:31:18.440 --> 00:31:20.960
 And they just coat it in the sticky stuff and then they keep on coating.

00:31:20.960 --> 00:31:23.040
 And that's how pearl develops.

00:31:23.040 --> 00:31:26.600
 But this is the amazing thing about how mollusks make them.

00:31:26.600 --> 00:31:32.040
 They can moderate the thickness of the layers that they produce.

00:31:32.040 --> 00:31:33.480
 I find this really weird.

00:31:33.480 --> 00:31:38.880
 If a layer of a pearl is a bit thick on one side, the next layer will be thinner on that

00:31:38.880 --> 00:31:39.880
 one side in response.

00:31:39.880 --> 00:31:42.160
 Oh, that's why they're pure circles.

00:31:42.160 --> 00:31:47.200
 That's why they're perfectly round, is because they're constantly balancing out to make

00:31:47.200 --> 00:31:48.200
 it so I know.

00:31:48.200 --> 00:31:53.040
 And that this was studied by scientists who cut pearls with a diamond wire saw and then

00:31:53.040 --> 00:31:57.120
 polished them and counted the layers and measured the thickness of all the layers.

00:31:57.120 --> 00:31:58.120
 That's really cool.

00:31:58.120 --> 00:31:59.120
 It's really craft.

00:31:59.120 --> 00:32:00.120
 They're actually crafty.

00:32:00.120 --> 00:32:01.120
 Yeah, yeah.

00:32:01.120 --> 00:32:02.120
 That's really beautiful.

00:32:02.120 --> 00:32:05.120
 You know what, the oysters that you get pearls in are not the same as the oysters that

00:32:05.120 --> 00:32:06.120
 you eat.

00:32:06.120 --> 00:32:07.120
 Is that so?

00:32:07.120 --> 00:32:08.120
 Yeah.

00:32:08.120 --> 00:32:09.120
 They're different species.

00:32:09.120 --> 00:32:13.800
 They're in the same family, but that's as closely as they're related.

00:32:13.800 --> 00:32:18.640
 So the eater oysters are in Australia dye and the pearl oysters are in their terry dye.

00:32:18.640 --> 00:32:23.120
 I thought when you said the eating oysters, I thought very upper-class oysters were very

00:32:23.120 --> 00:32:24.440
 well-educated.

00:32:24.440 --> 00:32:32.200
 So those two types of oysters are less closely related to each other than we are to the world's

00:32:32.200 --> 00:32:33.520
 smallest monkey.

00:32:33.520 --> 00:32:40.880
 So while these say the appearance of the world's smallest monkey, he's the size of a pearl

00:32:40.880 --> 00:32:41.880
 now.

00:32:41.880 --> 00:32:44.440
 It's the size of the world's biggest pearl.

00:32:44.440 --> 00:32:46.920
 At the time, which actually is not the world's biggest pearl anymore.

00:32:46.920 --> 00:32:47.920
 No, no, absolutely.

00:32:47.920 --> 00:32:52.840
 The world's biggest pearl is the gigapurl, which was discovered in the Philippines, and is

00:32:52.840 --> 00:32:54.840
 I'd say that one.

00:32:54.840 --> 00:32:55.840
 Don't know.

00:32:55.840 --> 00:32:56.840
 Yeah.

00:32:56.840 --> 00:33:00.920
 It's 27, just over 27 kilos and it's the size of a female chimp.

00:33:00.920 --> 00:33:02.720
 That's a hell of a jump from 11 grams.

00:33:02.720 --> 00:33:03.720
 Yeah.

00:33:03.720 --> 00:33:04.720
 27 kilos.

00:33:04.720 --> 00:33:06.080
 But it's not like a really beautiful one.

00:33:06.080 --> 00:33:07.920
 It looks kind of a bit ugly, doesn't it?

00:33:07.920 --> 00:33:09.560
 But it's not a perfect round pearl.

00:33:09.560 --> 00:33:10.560
 No, no, no.

00:33:10.560 --> 00:33:12.800
 It looks a bit like a monkey brain.

00:33:12.800 --> 00:33:13.800
 I think I saw a picture of it.

00:33:13.800 --> 00:33:14.800
 Yeah.

00:33:14.800 --> 00:33:15.800
 It looks a bit.

00:33:15.800 --> 00:33:19.640
 We didn't know we had it for a long time because this Filipino man who owned it just kept

00:33:19.640 --> 00:33:20.640
 it under his bed.

00:33:20.640 --> 00:33:21.640
 He didn't know what it was.

00:33:21.640 --> 00:33:25.160
 He had it for 10 years and eventually he just had to get it out of the house.

00:33:25.160 --> 00:33:28.840
 If James's fact would be a lot more interesting, the pearl was lost for 10 years down the

00:33:28.840 --> 00:33:32.640
 back of his sofa, then we could have paid attention.

00:33:32.640 --> 00:33:35.240
 I think that interest me is James.

00:33:35.240 --> 00:33:40.880
 The thing that interest me is value, all right, so why do we decide that pearls are valuable?

00:33:40.880 --> 00:33:45.160
 So for example Mark Twain's great quote, "I wonder how much people would pay for a soap

00:33:45.160 --> 00:33:50.720
 bubble, if there's only one in the world that wonderful iridescence you get on bubbles."

00:33:50.720 --> 00:33:56.120
 And in some cultures, mother of pearl, that marvellous thing you get inside the shell

00:33:56.120 --> 00:33:58.400
 is more valuable than the pearl themselves.

00:33:58.400 --> 00:34:02.120
 The Japanese divers used to throw away the pearls because they're collecting the mother of

00:34:02.120 --> 00:34:03.440
 pearl.

00:34:03.440 --> 00:34:10.280
 And yet, according to Suetonius, the Roman historian, the main reason Julius Caesar invaded

00:34:10.280 --> 00:34:12.360
 Britain, do you know what it was?

00:34:12.360 --> 00:34:19.720
 It wasn't tin or leather, I think it was because I had the biggest supply of freshwater pearls

00:34:19.720 --> 00:34:20.720
 in mussels.

00:34:20.720 --> 00:34:21.720
 Really?

00:34:21.720 --> 00:34:22.720
 Do we still have pearls?

00:34:22.720 --> 00:34:23.720
 The biggest in Europe.

00:34:23.720 --> 00:34:27.200
 I've been to a pearl farm in the UK somewhere, I'm sure, maybe it was in the Isle of White

00:34:27.200 --> 00:34:28.200
 or somewhere.

00:34:28.200 --> 00:34:29.200
 Right.

00:34:29.200 --> 00:34:30.200
 But do we make pearls in this country?

00:34:30.200 --> 00:34:31.200
 We do.

00:34:31.200 --> 00:34:32.200
 I don't know.

00:34:32.200 --> 00:34:36.600
 There aren't any pearl factories, I think, but freshwater pearl mussels are a big deal.

00:34:36.600 --> 00:34:37.600
 Okay.

00:34:37.600 --> 00:34:40.480
 And they're being re-bred and re-introduced, and they're more common in Scotland because

00:34:40.480 --> 00:34:44.040
 the waters just lock cleaner up there, basically, and the mussels can survive.

00:34:44.040 --> 00:34:46.040
 But yeah, you get British pearls.

00:34:46.040 --> 00:34:47.040
 Right.

00:34:47.040 --> 00:34:48.520
 And in fact, they're incredibly weird.

00:34:48.520 --> 00:34:51.120
 They release millions of larvae into the water.

00:34:51.120 --> 00:34:52.120
 That's how they breathe.

00:34:52.120 --> 00:34:53.520
 It's called a sperm cast.

00:34:53.520 --> 00:34:54.520
 Yep.

00:34:54.520 --> 00:35:00.600
 Which is something else around, yeah, yeah.

00:35:00.600 --> 00:35:04.160
 And then they hope to get themselves swallowed by a passing salmon.

00:35:04.160 --> 00:35:07.200
 This is their tactic, or this is their life cycle, basically.

00:35:07.200 --> 00:35:11.520
 They spend a year living on the gills of this salmon or a brown trout, and then they drop

00:35:11.520 --> 00:35:15.600
 off the gills after a year and they burrow into the riverbed, and they can live in a riverbed

00:35:15.600 --> 00:35:16.600
 for 130 years.

00:35:16.600 --> 00:35:17.600
 What?

00:35:17.600 --> 00:35:18.600
 Wow.

00:35:18.600 --> 00:35:19.600
 There will be some.

00:35:19.600 --> 00:35:20.600
 Wow.

00:35:20.600 --> 00:35:26.040
 There could be pearls in the UK, which remember Queen Victoria, or which were around in the

00:35:26.040 --> 00:35:27.040
 time of Queen Victoria.

00:35:27.040 --> 00:35:28.040
 Yes.

00:35:28.040 --> 00:35:29.040
 That's crazy.

00:35:29.040 --> 00:35:30.040
 That's very nice.

00:35:30.040 --> 00:35:34.880
 Well, they might remember, then, if they remember that time, we were talking about the

00:35:34.880 --> 00:35:39.480
 fact that this pearl was lost at Windsor Castle, but something was also lost in a sofa

00:35:39.480 --> 00:35:45.260
 in Buckingham Palace, while Queen Victoria was Queen, and that was a 14-year-old boy of

00:35:45.260 --> 00:35:46.260
 Palace.

00:35:46.260 --> 00:35:47.260
 Yeah.

00:35:47.260 --> 00:35:48.260
 They just lost the boy.

00:35:48.260 --> 00:35:51.060
 Yeah, for a momentarily off for a hundred and a half years.

00:35:51.060 --> 00:35:54.300
 Was he larger or smaller than the world's smallest monkey?

00:35:54.300 --> 00:35:55.300
 He was called Boy Jones.

00:35:55.300 --> 00:35:56.300
 He's quite famous.

00:35:56.300 --> 00:35:57.300
 Edward Jones.

00:35:57.300 --> 00:36:01.980
 He was the first ever celebrity stalker, broke into Buckingham Palace multiple times, sat

00:36:01.980 --> 00:36:05.780
 on the edge of a bed once, took her underwear, boy Jones.

00:36:05.780 --> 00:36:06.780
 Oh, boy Jones.

00:36:06.780 --> 00:36:09.500
 Yeah, he hid under a sofa at that point.

00:36:09.500 --> 00:36:10.500
 Was he actually a boy?

00:36:10.500 --> 00:36:11.500
 Yeah.

00:36:11.500 --> 00:36:12.500
 Yeah, it was 14.

00:36:12.500 --> 00:36:13.500
 Yeah, 14.

00:36:13.500 --> 00:36:16.260
 I don't think he was taking the underwear because he was a pervert.

00:36:16.260 --> 00:36:19.380
 I think he was just wanting to show that he would, he'd been there.

00:36:19.380 --> 00:36:22.220
 Well, he was a 14-year-old boy, so it was probably a bit of a pervert.

00:36:22.220 --> 00:36:25.500
 It's all like all 14-year-old boys.

00:36:25.500 --> 00:36:26.500
 Yeah.

00:36:26.500 --> 00:36:29.780
 Tell me if I'm wrong about this, but I think they caught him, and then they let him go,

00:36:29.780 --> 00:36:32.180
 and then they caught him again, and then they sent him to Australia.

00:36:32.180 --> 00:36:34.460
 Yeah, they were like, "Okay, you've broken in twice.

00:36:34.460 --> 00:36:37.100
 Where can we put you that will just make it that slight bit more hard?"

00:36:37.100 --> 00:36:38.100
 Yeah.

00:36:38.100 --> 00:36:39.100
 To get in Australia.

00:36:39.100 --> 00:36:40.100
 Wow.

00:36:40.100 --> 00:36:41.100
 Do we know what he did in Australia?

00:36:41.100 --> 00:36:42.100
 Did he?

00:36:42.100 --> 00:36:43.100
 I think he dishears from history.

00:36:43.100 --> 00:36:44.100
 Right.

00:36:44.100 --> 00:36:46.500
 Yeah, I think if memory serves.

00:36:46.500 --> 00:36:50.140
 I think he took the underwear with him, and he opened a brand of shops called Victoria's

00:36:50.140 --> 00:36:51.140
 Secrets.

00:36:51.140 --> 00:36:52.140
 Beautiful.

00:36:52.140 --> 00:36:53.140
 Beautiful.

00:36:53.140 --> 00:36:59.540
 I, you say the world's largest pearl, I researched the world's largest things.

00:36:59.540 --> 00:37:00.540
 Okay.

00:37:00.540 --> 00:37:05.140
 So the Kuku in the world's largest Kuku clock weighs 23 and a half stone.

00:37:05.140 --> 00:37:06.140
 Wow.

00:37:06.140 --> 00:37:07.140
 Wow.

00:37:07.140 --> 00:37:08.140
 Okay.

00:37:08.140 --> 00:37:14.940
 The world's largest container ship can carry 4,282,600 mattresses.

00:37:14.940 --> 00:37:17.300
 Oh, but how many mumsets?

00:37:17.300 --> 00:37:21.740
 That's what we all really want to set.

00:37:21.740 --> 00:37:30.740
 And in 2018, in protest at losing access to the sea after a war with Chilean 1884, Bolivia

00:37:30.740 --> 00:37:32.740
 displayed the world's largest flag.

00:37:32.740 --> 00:37:34.860
 Do you know how big it is?

00:37:34.860 --> 00:37:38.540
 It's three meters wide and 200 kilometers long.

00:37:38.540 --> 00:37:39.540
 Sorry, yes, I did.

00:37:39.540 --> 00:37:42.940
 No, we're just going to continue with that quiz from Biffle.

00:37:42.940 --> 00:37:44.980
 Down another point to James.

00:37:44.980 --> 00:37:48.780
 You were killing this one.

00:37:48.780 --> 00:37:55.940
 Okay, it's time for our final fact of the show, and that is John.

00:37:55.940 --> 00:38:04.340
 Okay, my fact is, for a shipworm, the most nutritious part of an ice lolly is the stick.

00:38:04.340 --> 00:38:07.460
 The perfect companion for a day of the beach.

00:38:07.460 --> 00:38:08.460
 Yes.

00:38:08.460 --> 00:38:09.460
 You have the lolly there, the stick.

00:38:09.460 --> 00:38:10.940
 It's like Jack Spratt had his wife.

00:38:10.940 --> 00:38:11.940
 Yes.

00:38:11.940 --> 00:38:14.900
 Now, you obviously all know what a shipworm is.

00:38:14.900 --> 00:38:19.940
 I'm guessing, but for people who don't know, shipworms are not worms.

00:38:19.940 --> 00:38:20.940
 Yeah.

00:38:20.940 --> 00:38:23.500
 They are a kind of clam.

00:38:23.500 --> 00:38:29.900
 And unlike normal clams, or mussels or oysters, you know, reference the pearls, they don't

00:38:29.900 --> 00:38:30.900
 have a proper shell.

00:38:30.900 --> 00:38:36.220
 They're shells have evolved to slide off down the body and become a sort of amazing little

00:38:36.220 --> 00:38:42.140
 jaw thing, like a little hat, like a little helmet, but covered with lots of tiny teeth.

00:38:42.140 --> 00:38:47.540
 And they use these to bore into, they start as tiny larvae as thin as a needle, and they

00:38:47.540 --> 00:38:54.580
 bore into ships and wolves and peers and that kind of thing and destroy them by honeycombing

00:38:54.580 --> 00:38:55.580
 them.

00:38:55.580 --> 00:38:56.580
 Wow.

00:38:56.580 --> 00:39:00.020
 They're the bane of mariners and semen and sailors since forever.

00:39:00.020 --> 00:39:01.900
 I mean, they're the most extraordinary thing.

00:39:01.900 --> 00:39:04.860
 They've altered modern history, haven't they?

00:39:04.860 --> 00:39:05.860
 Yeah.

00:39:05.860 --> 00:39:08.020
 Like, basically, they have transformed the world we live in.

00:39:08.020 --> 00:39:12.260
 They're known as the termites of the sea, such an invasive problem.

00:39:12.260 --> 00:39:14.740
 There's something mystical and magical about these things.

00:39:14.740 --> 00:39:18.300
 There's a shipworm in every historical event that's on water.

00:39:18.300 --> 00:39:24.140
 So in 1503, shipworms honeycomb the hulls of Columbus' ships on his fourth voyage, two

00:39:24.140 --> 00:39:27.700
 of them sank and had to be abandoned, and the other two, they just managed to get to

00:39:27.700 --> 00:39:30.220
 Jamaica where they were considered unsee-way.

00:39:30.220 --> 00:39:33.900
 They were trapped there for a whole year, all of Columbus' men.

00:39:33.900 --> 00:39:39.460
 In 1580, when Francis Drake reached London after circumnavigating the globe, the golden

00:39:39.460 --> 00:39:43.740
 hind was rotten and spongy from shipworm and never sailed again.

00:39:43.740 --> 00:39:49.500
 On James Cook's first voyage, his ship, HMS, and there was so badly damaged by shipworm,

00:39:49.500 --> 00:39:52.060
 it had to be hauled onto land and repaired three times.

00:39:52.060 --> 00:39:53.340
 It just goes on.

00:39:53.340 --> 00:39:57.020
 Shipworms helped England defeat the Spanish Armada for Christ's sake.

00:39:57.020 --> 00:39:58.020
 Really?

00:39:58.020 --> 00:39:59.020
 Yes.

00:39:59.020 --> 00:40:00.020
 Yeah.

00:40:00.020 --> 00:40:02.860
 Because the Spanish ships were much bigger and more powerful, but the shipworms made them

00:40:02.860 --> 00:40:05.780
 weak and so cannibals would go straight through this rotten wood.

00:40:05.780 --> 00:40:06.780
 Right.

00:40:06.780 --> 00:40:07.780
 That's very cool.

00:40:07.780 --> 00:40:09.780
 I mean, the cannibals had something to do with it.

00:40:09.780 --> 00:40:10.780
 Yeah.

00:40:10.780 --> 00:40:11.780
 I mean, that's, yeah.

00:40:11.780 --> 00:40:15.300
 Their point of origin isn't even known, really, because they've just been spread worldwide

00:40:15.300 --> 00:40:16.300
 by boats.

00:40:16.300 --> 00:40:17.820
 So any time a ship takes it somewhere.

00:40:17.820 --> 00:40:19.660
 Cryptogenesis, like, you know, the cryptid factor.

00:40:19.660 --> 00:40:20.660
 That's what it's called.

00:40:20.660 --> 00:40:21.660
 Oh, really?

00:40:21.660 --> 00:40:24.100
 If you don't know where something's from, it's called cryptogenesis.

00:40:24.100 --> 00:40:25.100
 Right.

00:40:25.100 --> 00:40:28.460
 Or knows where the cryptid factor came from.

00:40:28.460 --> 00:40:31.580
 Or where it's going.

00:40:31.580 --> 00:40:36.260
 Wikipedia is very, I'd say, is very horny for shipworms.

00:40:36.260 --> 00:40:40.940
 It describes them as a group of saltwater clams with long, soft, naked bodies.

00:40:40.940 --> 00:40:41.940
 Wow.

00:40:41.940 --> 00:40:42.940
 Wow.

00:40:42.940 --> 00:40:43.940
 Wow.

00:40:43.940 --> 00:40:44.940
 It's quite something, isn't it?

00:40:44.940 --> 00:40:45.940
 Yeah.

00:40:45.940 --> 00:40:46.940
 You know, we all have naked bodies until we put clothes on.

00:40:46.940 --> 00:40:47.940
 Well, that's true.

00:40:47.940 --> 00:40:51.940
 But are they long and soft?

00:40:51.940 --> 00:40:56.260
 This is for sperm cast, Andy.

00:40:56.260 --> 00:41:00.220
 Well, I saw a description of, they don't look very nice shipworms.

00:41:00.220 --> 00:41:05.500
 It says, a shipworm's head under its little shell helmet looks like a blend of wet lips

00:41:05.500 --> 00:41:09.620
 and diseased intestines, and they have no eyes.

00:41:09.620 --> 00:41:11.100
 And they breathe through their bottoms.

00:41:11.100 --> 00:41:15.500
 I think, if you look like a mixture of wet lips and intestines or whatever it was, it's

00:41:15.500 --> 00:41:17.380
 probably good that you don't have any eyes.

00:41:17.380 --> 00:41:18.380
 That's true.

00:41:18.380 --> 00:41:23.460
 Well, also, they don't need to, they're very interesting things biologically, because they

00:41:23.460 --> 00:41:28.860
 don't, I think, have to find a partner, because they all start out male.

00:41:28.860 --> 00:41:33.940
 They just live as teenage boys, basically, on ships, burrowing into that.

00:41:33.940 --> 00:41:35.820
 Then they just steal in queens underwear.

00:41:35.820 --> 00:41:36.820
 That's it.

00:41:36.820 --> 00:41:37.820
 Yeah.

00:41:37.820 --> 00:41:38.660
 I think they just release sperm.

00:41:38.660 --> 00:41:41.180
 Then they turn female.

00:41:41.180 --> 00:41:44.380
 Then they just absorb the sperm that they just release when they were a teenage boy,

00:41:44.380 --> 00:41:45.860
 and they use that to mate.

00:41:45.860 --> 00:41:46.860
 Mmm.

00:41:46.860 --> 00:41:47.860
 That's easy.

00:41:47.860 --> 00:41:48.860
 It's an insult stream.

00:41:48.860 --> 00:41:49.860
 It is.

00:41:49.860 --> 00:41:50.860
 It absolutely is.

00:41:50.860 --> 00:41:55.580
 So, wood eating creatures are called xylophages, as I'm sure you know.

00:41:55.580 --> 00:41:58.580
 Now, of course, why do they eat wood?

00:41:58.580 --> 00:42:03.660
 The answer is because wood is mostly made of cellulose, and cellulose get this, is entirely

00:42:03.660 --> 00:42:04.660
 made of glucose.

00:42:04.660 --> 00:42:05.660
 Did you know that?

00:42:05.660 --> 00:42:06.660
 Oh.

00:42:06.660 --> 00:42:09.420
 So, if you can digest wood, it's extremely nutritious.

00:42:09.420 --> 00:42:11.020
 I mean, it really is.

00:42:11.020 --> 00:42:12.020
 Yum.

00:42:12.020 --> 00:42:16.900
 That's why a shipworm would love an isolate, but only the stick it would want, because

00:42:16.900 --> 00:42:20.700
 there's more glucose in the stick than there is in the lolly.

00:42:20.700 --> 00:42:21.700
 Wow.

00:42:21.700 --> 00:42:22.700
 I see.

00:42:22.700 --> 00:42:25.700
 And that's why you shouldn't eat the stick of your lolly, because they're actually just very

00:42:25.700 --> 00:42:26.700
 sugary.

00:42:26.700 --> 00:42:27.700
 Yeah, yeah.

00:42:27.700 --> 00:42:31.460
 If you had the right bacteria inside your stomach, you would be able to eat it, right?

00:42:31.460 --> 00:42:34.020
 Because it's in all these animals that eat wood.

00:42:34.020 --> 00:42:37.380
 They have some special bacteria in their stomach that can digest the wood.

00:42:37.380 --> 00:42:38.380
 Is that right?

00:42:38.380 --> 00:42:39.380
 Yes, that's right.

00:42:39.380 --> 00:42:40.380
 Yeah, yeah.

00:42:40.380 --> 00:42:41.380
 So, why do we not do that?

00:42:41.380 --> 00:42:44.580
 There must be some kind of pill you can take to give you that, like some kind of

00:42:44.580 --> 00:42:46.740
 yackel that will give you the wood bacteria.

00:42:46.740 --> 00:42:47.740
 Yeah.

00:42:47.740 --> 00:42:48.740
 Like a bacteria transfer, right?

00:42:48.740 --> 00:42:54.460
 I imagine a race of super soldiers who can just eat the wheat forests that the enemy are

00:42:54.460 --> 00:42:55.460
 hiding in.

00:42:55.460 --> 00:42:56.460
 Exactly.

00:42:56.460 --> 00:43:02.940
 I just want to make the end of a bath very different, doesn't it?

00:43:02.940 --> 00:43:06.940
 I just want to give a shout out for the positive side of shipworms, because obviously they

00:43:06.940 --> 00:43:11.620
 look disgusting and they do all this damage and so on, but you know, one study estimates

00:43:11.620 --> 00:43:16.340
 that shipworms have sunk more ships than pirates, I thought that was rather lovely.

00:43:16.340 --> 00:43:19.860
 But they also do good things, and there's nothing good or bad in the universe.

00:43:19.860 --> 00:43:23.100
 It's just, it depends which angle you're coming from.

00:43:23.100 --> 00:43:27.380
 So for example, they're responsible of cleaning up more driftwood in the world than anything

00:43:27.380 --> 00:43:29.380
 else.

00:43:29.380 --> 00:43:34.820
 And the rotary accents, so the way they drill is that little toothy, helmety thing, rotates

00:43:34.820 --> 00:43:36.940
 eight to ten times a minute.

00:43:36.940 --> 00:43:43.380
 And this inspired Mark Brunel, Isambard Kingdom Brunel's dad, to invent the rotary tunneling

00:43:43.380 --> 00:43:47.700
 machine that dug the first tunnel under the Thames, and which is still essentially used

00:43:47.700 --> 00:43:48.700
 today.

00:43:48.700 --> 00:43:49.700
 Wow.

00:43:49.700 --> 00:43:50.700
 That's all to do with shipworms.

00:43:50.700 --> 00:43:51.700
 So good for them.

00:43:51.700 --> 00:43:52.700
 Very cool.

00:43:52.700 --> 00:43:54.540
 And they gave us the industrial revolution.

00:43:54.540 --> 00:43:55.540
 Did they?

00:43:55.540 --> 00:43:56.540
 Shipworms.

00:43:56.540 --> 00:43:57.540
 So kind of, yes.

00:43:57.540 --> 00:44:03.500
 So because Britain needed metal ships to stop the shipworms from burrowing, we had to

00:44:03.500 --> 00:44:08.020
 get lots of metal on what did we have, because Julius Caesar wasn't bothered about it, lots

00:44:08.020 --> 00:44:09.620
 of copper.

00:44:09.620 --> 00:44:13.260
 And so we had to get at the copper, but it's underground.

00:44:13.260 --> 00:44:17.140
 So you need to do lots of mining, and then there's lots of water under the mines.

00:44:17.140 --> 00:44:19.540
 You need to get the water out, how do you get the water out?

00:44:19.540 --> 00:44:24.900
 You create engines and Thomas Buchmann created the steam engine to drain mines, because we

00:44:24.900 --> 00:44:28.180
 needed the copper, because we needed it to get rid of shipworms.

00:44:28.180 --> 00:44:30.340
 And that is essentially what started the industrial revolution.

00:44:30.340 --> 00:44:31.340
 Amazing.

00:44:31.340 --> 00:44:32.340
 It's so cool.

00:44:32.340 --> 00:44:34.340
 Lollie sticks.

00:44:34.340 --> 00:44:35.340
 Yeah.

00:44:35.340 --> 00:44:36.340
 Oh, yeah.

00:44:36.340 --> 00:44:38.020
 Do you remember when they had jokes on them?

00:44:38.020 --> 00:44:39.020
 Oh, yeah.

00:44:39.020 --> 00:44:40.020
 They're not still.

00:44:40.020 --> 00:44:45.300
 No, they got phased out in 1988, do you know why they got phased out?

00:44:45.300 --> 00:44:46.300
 I was.

00:44:46.300 --> 00:44:49.580
 Because there was a reason that they gave, and then there was the actual reason.

00:44:49.580 --> 00:44:50.580
 Because of woke.

00:44:50.580 --> 00:44:51.580
 Because of woke.

00:44:51.580 --> 00:44:52.580
 In 1988.

00:44:52.580 --> 00:44:53.580
 Yeah.

00:44:53.580 --> 00:44:54.580
 Because of early woke.

00:44:54.580 --> 00:44:55.580
 What?

00:44:55.580 --> 00:44:56.580
 Why?

00:44:56.580 --> 00:44:59.900
 What was the reason they gave out of date jokes?

00:44:59.900 --> 00:45:01.900
 Oh, that come on.

00:45:01.900 --> 00:45:04.220
 In Britain, the land of the cracker.

00:45:04.220 --> 00:45:07.220
 The land of the cracker.

00:45:07.220 --> 00:45:08.220
 I would it.

00:45:08.220 --> 00:45:09.220
 OK.

00:45:09.220 --> 00:45:10.220
 I'm going to give you that.

00:45:10.220 --> 00:45:15.740
 The official reason was that people had more sophisticated tastes than to, I mean, they're

00:45:15.740 --> 00:45:17.540
 selling these to children, right?

00:45:17.540 --> 00:45:18.540
 Yeah.

00:45:18.540 --> 00:45:19.540
 So just get what joke tastes?

00:45:19.540 --> 00:45:20.540
 Yeah, yeah.

00:45:20.540 --> 00:45:22.540
 What do they want, like lengthy observational stuff on the thing?

00:45:22.540 --> 00:45:23.540
 Just stupidly sense.

00:45:23.540 --> 00:45:31.140
 But the actual reason is because they were selling them abroad.

00:45:31.140 --> 00:45:33.780
 So you had a big batch of ice lollies that you made.

00:45:33.780 --> 00:45:34.780
 Right.

00:45:34.780 --> 00:45:36.900
 And they wouldn't all be sold in English-speaking countries.

00:45:36.900 --> 00:45:41.780
 So there's no point putting English jokes on there, because 50% of them would be in Spain

00:45:41.780 --> 00:45:42.780
 off of France, Hollywood.

00:45:42.780 --> 00:45:43.780
 Yes.

00:45:43.780 --> 00:45:44.780
 Such a shame.

00:45:44.780 --> 00:45:47.260
 I remember having jokes on my lollies today.

00:45:47.260 --> 00:45:48.260
 Yeah, sure.

00:45:48.260 --> 00:45:49.260
 I don't remember that.

00:45:49.260 --> 00:45:50.660
 But I was born in 1987.

00:45:50.660 --> 00:45:53.420
 So I would have, I kind of been having them when I was a year old.

00:45:53.420 --> 00:45:56.900
 Well, they occasionally bring them back for a very short amount of time.

00:45:56.900 --> 00:46:02.060
 I think in 2012, Wolves did a thing where they asked a lot of people to send in jokes that

00:46:02.060 --> 00:46:05.220
 they were going to print on the sticks and maybe for six months they did it.

00:46:05.220 --> 00:46:06.220
 Right.

00:46:06.220 --> 00:46:07.220
 Yeah.

00:46:07.220 --> 00:46:08.220
 So it comes in and out.

00:46:08.220 --> 00:46:10.220
 But generally speaking, they got phased out in '88.

00:46:10.220 --> 00:46:11.220
 Damn.

00:46:11.220 --> 00:46:13.260
 I've some ice lollies stuff.

00:46:13.260 --> 00:46:15.100
 Did you know that it was invented in Churin?

00:46:15.100 --> 00:46:16.100
 What's it?

00:46:16.100 --> 00:46:17.100
 Yes.

00:46:17.100 --> 00:46:21.860
 Along with Vermouth, Nutella and Ferro Roche, all invented in Churin.

00:46:21.860 --> 00:46:26.180
 In 1937, the chock ice, that was the first, the original ice lollies.

00:46:26.180 --> 00:46:30.940
 It was a good year for sweeties, actually, in 1937 because Maltese's, pop its smarties and

00:46:30.940 --> 00:46:33.100
 rolos were all invented in the same year.

00:46:33.100 --> 00:46:34.100
 Isn't that strange?

00:46:34.100 --> 00:46:37.500
 What was that sort of nexus of sweet inventions?

00:46:37.500 --> 00:46:40.660
 They must have just invented a lot of the machinery.

00:46:40.660 --> 00:46:43.500
 The Canberian explosion.

00:46:43.500 --> 00:46:44.500
 The Canberian explosion.

00:46:44.500 --> 00:46:45.500
 Really good.

00:46:45.500 --> 00:46:46.500
 Yeah.

00:46:46.500 --> 00:46:47.500
 Also, you mentioned.

00:46:47.500 --> 00:46:48.500
 So close to being a joke like that.

00:46:48.500 --> 00:46:49.500
 Almost.

00:46:49.500 --> 00:46:51.260
 No, I really like it.

00:46:51.260 --> 00:46:52.260
 The Canberian explosion.

00:46:52.260 --> 00:46:53.260
 The Canberian explosion.

00:46:53.260 --> 00:46:54.260
 The Canberian explosion.

00:46:54.260 --> 00:46:55.260
 The Canberian explosion.

00:46:55.260 --> 00:46:56.260
 The Canberian explosion.

00:46:56.260 --> 00:46:57.260
 Yeah, it doesn't work.

00:46:57.260 --> 00:46:58.260
 It's so close to a joke.

00:46:58.260 --> 00:46:59.260
 It's very close to a joke.

00:46:59.260 --> 00:47:00.260
 That's my radio show.

00:47:00.260 --> 00:47:02.260
 Welcome to a very close to a joke.

00:47:02.260 --> 00:47:06.860
 So, shall we talk about what we're talking about eating things?

00:47:06.860 --> 00:47:08.860
 I think people eat shipworms.

00:47:08.860 --> 00:47:09.860
 Yeah.

00:47:09.860 --> 00:47:10.860
 Some places.

00:47:10.860 --> 00:47:11.860
 Do they?

00:47:11.860 --> 00:47:12.860
 Yeah.

00:47:12.860 --> 00:47:13.860
 Okay.

00:47:13.860 --> 00:47:14.860
 They don't look nice, but they are delicious.

00:47:14.860 --> 00:47:17.220
 And they are also incredibly nutritious.

00:47:17.220 --> 00:47:22.340
 Shipworms have more protein than beef, as well as being rich in iron, zinc, selenium and

00:47:22.340 --> 00:47:24.140
 vitamin B12.

00:47:24.140 --> 00:47:27.500
 And you said Dan, they're called sometimes the termites of the sea.

00:47:27.500 --> 00:47:28.500
 Yes.

00:47:28.500 --> 00:47:33.460
 And a termite contains twice as much protein as solo in steak.

00:47:33.460 --> 00:47:34.460
 They're...

00:47:34.460 --> 00:47:37.620
 I'm not going to say taking it off, but I think the world's first modern shipworm farm

00:47:37.620 --> 00:47:43.940
 was founded a couple of years ago because they convert Borealwood to very edible protein.

00:47:43.940 --> 00:47:49.860
 But they're so brilliant, because if you're farming salmon, for example, in order for the

00:47:49.860 --> 00:47:53.320
 salmon to have something to do, you've got to collect four times as many tiny fish for

00:47:53.320 --> 00:47:54.320
 this.

00:47:54.320 --> 00:47:59.900
 This is ecologically incredibly damaging fish farming, whereas you just chuck a crappy old

00:47:59.900 --> 00:48:06.620
 log of driftwood into the thing and shipworms eat that, and it's incredibly effective environmentally.

00:48:06.620 --> 00:48:07.620
 Yeah.

00:48:07.620 --> 00:48:08.620
 They grow really fast, as well.

00:48:08.620 --> 00:48:09.620
 And they grow.

00:48:09.620 --> 00:48:10.620
 The shipworms grow.

00:48:10.620 --> 00:48:11.620
 What is it?

00:48:11.620 --> 00:48:12.620
 20 times as fast as muscles.

00:48:12.620 --> 00:48:14.260
 Which, obviously, we all like.

00:48:14.260 --> 00:48:15.900
 Are we eating shipworm food then?

00:48:15.900 --> 00:48:16.900
 Is it out there?

00:48:16.900 --> 00:48:17.900
 Not yet, but it is.

00:48:17.900 --> 00:48:25.380
 These two guys at Cambridge, David Willer and Bizarrelli, a guy called Ruben Shipway, started

00:48:25.380 --> 00:48:29.740
 the thing called the naked clam project, because, as Andy said, they're sort of naked because

00:48:29.740 --> 00:48:31.740
 they don't have a shell.

00:48:31.740 --> 00:48:35.980
 And they reckon this is going to solve world malnutrition, because not only they're very

00:48:35.980 --> 00:48:38.180
 nutritious, they're environmentally safe.

00:48:38.180 --> 00:48:42.700
 And they've got this amazing thing is, in the tanks where these shipworms nibbling on the

00:48:42.700 --> 00:48:47.620
 driftwood, they chuck in a few garlic capsules as well, so that you get ready garlic clam.

00:48:47.620 --> 00:48:48.620
 Oh, my God.

00:48:48.620 --> 00:48:49.620
 You know what?

00:48:49.620 --> 00:48:53.780
 Next to my house, not far from my house, there was a restaurant opened where all the food

00:48:53.780 --> 00:48:55.220
 was made out of insects.

00:48:55.220 --> 00:48:56.220
 Oh, yeah?

00:48:56.220 --> 00:48:57.780
 In the last, this was in the last year.

00:48:57.780 --> 00:48:58.780
 Wow.

00:48:58.780 --> 00:49:01.900
 It lasted about three months, because people do not want to eat that shit.

00:49:01.900 --> 00:49:02.900
 Oh, I'm sorry.

00:49:02.900 --> 00:49:03.900
 You must have gone presumably.

00:49:03.900 --> 00:49:04.900
 I wanted to.

00:49:04.900 --> 00:49:08.940
 And then by the time I tried to buck it, it was already closed down.

00:49:08.940 --> 00:49:09.940
 But you wonder why not?

00:49:09.940 --> 00:49:16.540
 I mean, one of the many xylophages, along with beavers and woodworm, death watch, beetle,

00:49:16.540 --> 00:49:19.740
 is woodlice, which are wood-eating things.

00:49:19.740 --> 00:49:25.140
 And they are closely related to the, they're not insects, they're crustaceans, and we don't

00:49:25.140 --> 00:49:28.100
 have a problem eating clams or lobsters, but woodlice.

00:49:28.100 --> 00:49:32.620
 Well, it's because it's got louse, lice in the title, but the same with shipworms.

00:49:32.620 --> 00:49:34.380
 If you call them shipworms, people aren't going to want to eat them.

00:49:34.380 --> 00:49:38.420
 If you call them long oyster, yum, yum, yum.

00:49:38.420 --> 00:49:43.580
 Oh, was that thing a scoffier went, a scoffier first one to serve frog's legs.

00:49:43.580 --> 00:49:45.380
 He called them nymphs of the dawn.

00:49:45.380 --> 00:49:46.380
 Brilliant.

00:49:46.380 --> 00:49:48.060
 But we can come up with a good name for shipworms.

00:49:48.060 --> 00:49:49.060
 We can get in on this.

00:49:49.060 --> 00:49:53.660
 When naked clams doesn't do it for me, when one, that doesn't sound, long, soft naked.

00:49:53.660 --> 00:49:54.660
 Yeah.

00:49:54.660 --> 00:49:55.660
 Black bodies.

00:49:55.660 --> 00:49:56.660
 Chocolate willies.

00:49:56.660 --> 00:49:57.660
 Try more of that.

00:49:57.660 --> 00:49:58.660
 No.

00:49:58.660 --> 00:50:01.260
 They already exist.

00:50:01.260 --> 00:50:02.860
 One shipworm we haven't mentioned.

00:50:02.860 --> 00:50:03.860
 Oh, yeah.

00:50:03.860 --> 00:50:04.860
 Giant shipworm.

00:50:04.860 --> 00:50:07.100
 Oh, yes, we must have that in.

00:50:07.100 --> 00:50:09.820
 Kufus polythalamia.

00:50:09.820 --> 00:50:13.060
 It was legendary for a long time, Dan, right up the hill straight.

00:50:13.060 --> 00:50:14.060
 Oh, yeah.

00:50:14.060 --> 00:50:17.260
 And it doesn't live in the sea, so it's a related species, because there are loads of different

00:50:17.260 --> 00:50:18.260
 species of species.

00:50:18.260 --> 00:50:19.260
 Yes.

00:50:19.260 --> 00:50:21.100
 And we've mostly been talking about the one that eats ships, which is one specific species

00:50:21.100 --> 00:50:22.180
 of shipworm.

00:50:22.180 --> 00:50:26.260
 This one lives in mud, and it doesn't barrel into wood.

00:50:26.260 --> 00:50:31.740
 It builds this chalky case around itself, and it can get up to five feet long.

00:50:31.740 --> 00:50:32.740
 Wow.

00:50:32.740 --> 00:50:33.740
 It's so big.

00:50:33.740 --> 00:50:36.180
 It's the same size as Nicki Minaj.

00:50:36.180 --> 00:50:37.180
 Nicki Minaj.

00:50:37.180 --> 00:50:43.940
 And 40 times longer than the smallest monkey with a sofa.

00:50:43.940 --> 00:50:49.540
 But you said Dan, most shipworms are eight to 18 inches long, and this can be five, six

00:50:49.540 --> 00:50:50.540
 feet long.

00:50:50.540 --> 00:50:51.540
 But it doesn't eat wood.

00:50:51.540 --> 00:50:53.180
 That's the weird thing about this shipworm.

00:50:53.180 --> 00:50:54.180
 Yeah, it's bizarre.

00:50:54.180 --> 00:50:57.820
 But basically, it was a team of scientists who found one, and they found it because someone

00:50:57.820 --> 00:51:00.620
 in the Philippines had taken a film of it on YouTube.

00:51:00.620 --> 00:51:03.660
 They'd been searching for it for ages without success, and then someone found it

00:51:03.660 --> 00:51:05.060
 on YouTube, basically.

00:51:05.060 --> 00:51:10.100
 But you can see them pouring it out of its shell or whatever it is, and it's absolutely

00:51:10.100 --> 00:51:11.100
 disgusting.

00:51:11.100 --> 00:51:13.380
 It's really, it's the stuff of nightmares.

00:51:13.380 --> 00:51:14.380
 It's really cool.

00:51:14.380 --> 00:51:16.740
 So if it was called muddy nymphs, would you eat it?

00:51:16.740 --> 00:51:17.740
 Yes.

00:51:17.740 --> 00:51:18.740
 Absolutely.

00:51:18.740 --> 00:51:19.740
 12.

00:51:19.740 --> 00:51:20.740
 Yeah.

00:51:20.740 --> 00:51:26.580
 Okay, that's it.

00:51:26.580 --> 00:51:27.820
 That is all of our facts.

00:51:27.820 --> 00:51:28.980
 Thank you so much for listening.

00:51:28.980 --> 00:51:32.060
 If you'd like to get in contact with any of us about the things that we've said over

00:51:32.060 --> 00:51:36.480
 the course of this podcast, we can all be found on our online social media accounts.

00:51:36.480 --> 00:51:39.380
 I'm on @Sriberland on Instagram, James.

00:51:39.380 --> 00:51:41.780
 My Instagram is no such thing as James Harkin.

00:51:41.780 --> 00:51:42.780
 And Andy.

00:51:42.780 --> 00:51:44.300
 My name is @AndraHunterRab.

00:51:44.300 --> 00:51:45.620
 John, you're also online?

00:51:45.620 --> 00:51:49.540
 Yes, I'm on Instagram as John Lloyd, QI or one word.

00:51:49.540 --> 00:51:50.540
 Yeah.

00:51:50.540 --> 00:51:51.540
 Very exciting.

00:51:51.540 --> 00:51:54.780
 And just to remind everyone, the meaning of LIF has been reissued.

00:51:54.780 --> 00:51:59.340
 It's the 42nd year, so the meaning of LIF is 42.

00:51:59.340 --> 00:52:00.340
 Yes.

00:52:00.340 --> 00:52:02.020
 And that's in all bookshops now.

00:52:02.020 --> 00:52:03.020
 And online.

00:52:03.020 --> 00:52:04.740
 So get it for Christmas for someone you love.

00:52:04.740 --> 00:52:05.740
 It is for my money.

00:52:05.740 --> 00:52:10.380
 It's the funniest book that's ever been written, John Lloyd and Douglas Adams, the co-writers.

00:52:10.380 --> 00:52:15.460
 Now, also, if you want to send us any facts that you want us to put into our shows, either

00:52:15.460 --> 00:52:20.140
 Drop Us Align or Little Fish podcast@QI.com is the place to get us all.

00:52:20.140 --> 00:52:21.940
 Andy goes through all of those emails.

00:52:21.940 --> 00:52:24.900
 He picks out the best bits and we bring them to those shows.

00:52:24.900 --> 00:52:30.900
