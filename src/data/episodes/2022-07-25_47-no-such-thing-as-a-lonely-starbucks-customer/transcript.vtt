00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:12.680
 Hello and welcome to another episode.

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:15.600
 A nice such thing as a fish, a weekly podcast coming to you

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:17.840
 from the QI offices in Covern Garden.

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:18.840
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.720
 I'm sitting here with Anichezinski, Andy Murray, and James

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:22.220
 Harkin.

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:24.400
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:27.200
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days.

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:29.400
 And in no particular order, here we go.

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:30.680
 [MUSIC]

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:34.320
 Starting with fact number one, and that is James.

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.480
 >> Okay, my fact this week is that according to a 2011

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:43.080
 Yugov survey, 27% of Britons neither love nor hate Marmite.

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:44.120
 >> I love that.

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:45.520
 >> That makes a lot of sense.

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:46.640
 >> It is a great fact.

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:47.320
 >> I really love it.

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:48.320
 >> I think that's 27% I think.

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:49.520
 >> I think I am too.

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:51.160
 >> I love it, I love it.

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:52.000
 >> Yeah.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.080
 >> But here's a weird one.

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:57.920
 I love Vegemite, but I hate Marmite when you take the comparison higher.

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:00.480
 >> So you would obviously love Vegemite, because you're Australian.

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.520
 But I actually prefer Vegemites of Marmite.

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.400
 And I think I'm probably the only British person who would admit to that.

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:06.480
 It's just better, guys.

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:11.280
 >> Well, I read an extraordinary story that IBM did a global survey of the most

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.560
 talked about brands online.

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.960
 And they went through the internet scouring it for the most brands that were spoken about.

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:22.600
 And the top brand, higher than Coke, higher than Nike, was Vegemite.

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:23.440
 >> Really?

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:25.360
 >> More spoken about than any other brand.

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:28.440
 You don't need to speak about Coke because it's always going to be like that.

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:29.400
 >> Yeah, it could be that.

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:35.640
 And the weird thing is that they tracked it down that 98% of Vegemite eaters are all Australian.

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:36.720
 >> How many, what percent, are you?

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:37.720
 >> 98%.

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:38.840
 >> Well, that sounds right.

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:40.240
 >> Well, I don't think you can buy it anywhere else.

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:41.520
 >> You can get it overseas now.

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.160
 You can get it in the supermarkets here.

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:47.240
 But so what's even more interesting is that it wasn't like they were tracking it to Australia.

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:48.880
 They were tracking it globally.

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:51.960
 So they know where all the Australians are around the world.

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:52.960
 >> Wow.

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:54.920
 >> Through Vegemite consumption.

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:56.400
 >> Yeah, that's really great.

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:58.240
 >> I mean, that's not obviously all the Australians.

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:02.280
 But it's like, it's just, it gives you a great map of how spread out Aussies are around the world.

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.800
 >> You could probably do the same with British and baked beans.

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:06.120
 >> Yes, yeah.

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:10.200
 >> Although Vegemite is now really popular in certain Asian countries, like in Hong Kong,

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.040
 it's all sold out in Hong Kong from all supermarkets suddenly.

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:16.440
 And that was when it was connected to umami flavor.

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:20.120
 So there was like a little press around it at some point, which said that is the umami flavor.

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:25.520
 Because that's, you know, hailed as a brilliant flavor in particularly in Japan and Hong Kong.

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:27.080
 Suddenly it's incredibly popular.

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.800
 >> Wow.

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:31.080
 >> Right. Hey guys, are we talking about Vegemite on this podcast?

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:32.920
 Or are we talking about James' fact about mami?

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:38.160
 >> My fact is about mami, so don't bring your Australian waves up in here.

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.040
 >> I didn't know it's got celery in it.

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.560
 >> That's it?

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:41.360
 >> Yeah.

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:42.480
 >> Mami is made with celery.

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.360
 >> Wow, that must have been so good for you.

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:45.240
 >> Yes.

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.800
 >> Excellent.

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:48.880
 >> It also has like the remnants of beer in it, doesn't it?

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:52.320
 That's what it's made of, it's like the extract from the beer making.

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:55.520
 >> Is it still, well, probably not anymore, but that's where it originally came from.

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:57.680
 >> If you've got yeast left over, you may as well use it for a little while.

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:59.960
 >> Yeah, I want to know, it's not drunk after breakfast.

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:03.120
 >> That's because you have a serious problem in it.

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:04.800
 It's because you're always drinking a breakfast.

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:06.720
 I don't think it's the mami.

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:09.640
 It gives the pine pine to wine if you're having good.

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:11.520
 >> I don't blame the mami.

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:13.360
 >> I think I must have had a bad slice of mami.

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:18.840
 >> There was speaking of drinking, they released on Valentine's Day.

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:22.840
 In 2008, they released champagne flavored mami.

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:25.360
 >> I don't remember that, and it had 3% champagne in it.

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:31.240
 Now, I would have thought that the mami would overpower the 3% of champagne.

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:33.680
 >> Mami's a famously mild flavor.

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:36.120
 >> Mami, do you know what it means?

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:39.480
 It means our mami is an old French cooking pot.

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:44.240
 So, you know the front of a mami jar, there is the little picture of a red and yellow.

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:45.320
 >> Yeah, of a casserole dish.

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:46.800
 >> Of a casserole dish, that is a mami.

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:51.680
 >> Yeah, it's because it was originally made to add a little bit of extra to casseroles.

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:53.400
 That was the point of mami in the first place.

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:53.920
 >> Oh, really?

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:55.360
 >> Yeah, flavor.

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:58.600
 >> Yeah, it's like a stock cube or something like that.

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:04.800
 Because it was invented by the same guy who invented oxo cubes who was called Justus von Liebig.

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:12.000
 And he was the first person who realized that you could take the yeast extracts and turn it into something you could eat.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.360
 But he is also known as the father of the fertilizer industry.

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:18.720
 Because he discovered that nitrogen is essential for plants.

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:22.800
 And he also developed a breast milk substitute for babies.

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:23.680
 >> Wow, wow.

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:25.760
 >> So, he taught this guy, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:30.760
 >> So, hang on, archetype of the British mami was invented by, was he German?

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:32.040
 >> Justus von Liebig sounds German.

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:33.880
 >> Yeah, I think he was actually.

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:39.240
 I think his main manufacturing place was in Freybentos, which is in Uruguay as well.

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:40.320
 >> Yeah, why do you call it mami?

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:44.280
 He should call it justice, so he could say justice will be served and breakfast.

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:49.680
 >> Why do you want this mami thing to even?

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:52.160
 >> So, was his breast milk substitute mami?

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:53.600
 >> That's what it was.

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:56.080
 >> You just claim to have invented it.

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:58.760
 >> I mean, invented a delicious ability.

00:04:58.760 --> 00:04:59.920
 >> It's a mami shot.

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:02.400
 >> And a fantastic new hemorrhoid crepe.

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:05.640
 >> Right.

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:11.400
 >> There are a lot of articles I'd like about mami, because it's something that people like talking about.

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:15.240
 And I read this phrase, mami, one, two world wars.

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:17.080
 Okay, that's not strictly true.

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:22.400
 It's the fastest climb down from the assertion of a fact I've ever read.

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:24.120
 And that was on a BBC article about it.

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:27.440
 >> But what they mean was it was in Soldiers Rations in the First World War.

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:28.480
 >> Yeah.

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:33.640
 >> Because you would get spammed condensed milk and mami basically didn't you?

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:34.320
 >> That's not me.

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:38.280
 >> They had this kind of con beef stuff that no one liked.

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:43.520
 And so a few people wanted to eat it that they ended up just using it to prop up things in the trenches.

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:45.840
 And they'll crates and crates of this stuff that normally eat.

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:51.440
 >> I think they would over indulge in the trenches if they were just using their food as opposed to.

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:53.480
 >> Not genuinely they did, because they liked something.

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:54.440
 >> It's not bad, was it?

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:57.840
 >> You think they were over indulged in the trenches?

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:01.080
 >> [LAUGH] >> Just replay that.

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:02.960
 >> How have I much?

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:03.560
 >> I have much.

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:08.160
 >> You think that the rancid meat they were served, which they could only walk on.

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:11.000
 >> [LAUGH] >> Wow.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:12.600
 >> They were a little bit spoiled.

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:14.720
 >> [LAUGH]

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:24.480
 >> So the thing about the actual slogan itself was that it was just a genius slogan in that it just created a whole lot of things.

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:30.800
 >> Yeah, it was just fantastic and I was looking into a few slogans and I read the most popular slogan.

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:34.840
 We've mentioned it slightly by saying if British people were around the world.

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:36.520
 >> Heinz makes beans or whatever.

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:37.520
 >> Beans means Heinz.

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:38.520
 >> Yeah.

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:42.400
 >> Yeah, supposedly the most successful of all the slogans.

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:47.160
 >> Do they know on what metric that's the most successful in terms of the most people who remember it or.

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:51.800
 >> Yeah, I don't know, I actually know it was just a poll to say which was your favorite and.

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:52.800
 >> But it's very good.

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:54.200
 >> Beans means Heinz.

00:06:54.200 --> 00:07:00.600
 >> This led me to a kind of little snoop into the world of slogans, which I just.

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:04.440
 I ended up looking at basically the last Brazil world cup.

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:07.240
 >> They all came in with country slogans, did you see the slogans?

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:08.040
 >> I don't remember.

00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:11.560
 >> Each country had a brand new slogan that they brought with their country.

00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:14.440
 >> Okay, so give us a country and we'll see if we can work out like that.

00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:16.560
 >> Okay, origin Tina.

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:18.160
 Give us the Falcons back, you bastard.

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:20.800
 >> [LAUGH]

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:22.000
 >> Is that it?

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:23.000
 >> Catchy.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.680
 >> No, it's a rather boring word for that.

00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:28.840
 It's not just a team, we are a country.

00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:31.600
 France, this is my favorite one actually, the French one.

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:32.720
 >> Total France.

00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:39.080
 >> No, so it's impossible is not a French word, which I love, because it literally is.

00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:40.900
 >> [LAUGH]

00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:41.720
 >> That's amazing.

00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:42.720
 >> Yeah.

00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:48.480
 >> I think that that French line, impossible is not a French word, is it was originally an

00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:49.760
 appolian quotation.

00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:50.760
 >> Yeah.

00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:51.760
 >> Okay.

00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:53.200
 >> Just in case we get to that if I could.

00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:54.200
 >> Yeah.

00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:55.520
 >> He was also wrong.

00:07:55.520 --> 00:08:01.780
 >> Yeah, this, I really like this story is from an article, again, sort of interesting

00:08:01.780 --> 00:08:06.940
 fact about Marmite, I'm quoting directly, in 2009, a Marmite obsessed thief targeted a

00:08:06.940 --> 00:08:10.180
 petrol station and stole 18 jars over a month.

00:08:10.180 --> 00:08:14.140
 Ultimately, the owners stopped stocking it to prevent him striking again.

00:08:14.140 --> 00:08:16.460
 >> [LAUGH]

00:08:16.460 --> 00:08:22.020
 >> I love that, you go into like Tesco's and there's nothing there, it's like, well, we've

00:08:22.020 --> 00:08:24.420
 had no robberies for the last three years.

00:08:24.420 --> 00:08:25.420
 >> [LAUGH]

00:08:25.420 --> 00:08:28.340
 >> But that's what they said, I read that article and they were like, well, what's the point

00:08:28.340 --> 00:08:29.340
 of us putting it on ourselves?

00:08:29.340 --> 00:08:31.940
 If this guy's just going to nick them, there's no point.

00:08:31.940 --> 00:08:33.580
 >> No, but it's such a capitulation.

00:08:33.580 --> 00:08:34.580
 >> Yeah.

00:08:34.580 --> 00:08:35.580
 >> To theft.

00:08:35.580 --> 00:08:36.660
 >> It does feel like that guy's one.

00:08:36.660 --> 00:08:37.860
 >> [LAUGH]

00:08:37.860 --> 00:08:39.340
 >> Should we move on?

00:08:39.340 --> 00:08:40.460
 >> Yeah, let's move on.

00:08:40.460 --> 00:08:41.860
 >> A bit of joint matters.

00:08:41.860 --> 00:08:42.860
 >> Yeah.

00:08:42.860 --> 00:08:43.860
 >> One more thing I read.

00:08:43.860 --> 00:08:47.380
 Former Chelsea Footballer Nicholas Anelka is said to be scared by Marmite.

00:08:47.380 --> 00:08:48.860
 >> [LAUGH]

00:08:48.860 --> 00:08:49.860
 >> Why?

00:08:49.860 --> 00:08:52.740
 >> I don't know, but he always goes to that petrol station these days.

00:08:52.740 --> 00:08:53.740
 >> Yeah.

00:08:53.740 --> 00:08:56.220
 [MUSIC]

00:08:56.220 --> 00:08:58.300
 >> Okay, time for fact number two.

00:08:58.300 --> 00:09:03.020
 My fact this week is that the Knights of the Round Table included Lancelot,

00:09:03.020 --> 00:09:05.660
 Gawain, Galahad, and Gareth.

00:09:05.660 --> 00:09:06.860
 >> [LAUGH]

00:09:06.860 --> 00:09:08.900
 >> Gareth, the Knight.

00:09:08.900 --> 00:09:10.060
 >> What was his job?

00:09:10.060 --> 00:09:11.820
 >> He was just like a classic Knight.

00:09:11.820 --> 00:09:12.900
 >> The weird thing though, I was looking.

00:09:12.900 --> 00:09:14.100
 >> He's not one of the famous ones, isn't he?

00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:15.580
 >> He's not, then I was looking into him.

00:09:15.580 --> 00:09:20.020
 He's actually Arthur's nephew, which seems like autism in the workplace.

00:09:20.020 --> 00:09:21.060
 Here we go.

00:09:21.060 --> 00:09:23.340
 >> I can't believe there's a new seat at the table.

00:09:23.340 --> 00:09:23.860
 >> Yeah.

00:09:23.860 --> 00:09:26.180
 >> I think he was going to be one of the great knights who's finally made his way.

00:09:26.180 --> 00:09:28.860
 >> [LAUGH] >> Because you know there were lesser tables?

00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:29.360
 >> No.

00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:31.620
 >> Really? >> Yeah, are there other shapes as well?

00:09:31.620 --> 00:09:34.620
 >> I'm not sure, I thought there are oval tables, and then.

00:09:34.620 --> 00:09:38.900
 >> It was kind of like a main hall where they had, I mean, it obviously never happened.

00:09:38.900 --> 00:09:42.620
 But like, there's a novel that's come out talking about the lesser knights.

00:09:42.620 --> 00:09:47.220
 And I didn't realize that the novel actually has a basis in what is closer to the actual mythology.

00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:51.500
 There were lots of other tables where there were like older knights who were retired, and there were.

00:09:51.500 --> 00:09:55.180
 >> So it's like at a wedding where you've got the head table, and then you've got a really

00:09:55.180 --> 00:09:57.580
 crap one in the corner with tedious people.

00:09:57.580 --> 00:10:03.180
 >> Was there a trapezium table, with the knights of the trapezium table, or the rhombus?

00:10:03.180 --> 00:10:06.380
 >> [LAUGH] >> Just some of my favorite shapes, I thought I mentioned.

00:10:06.380 --> 00:10:09.940
 >> So they have round tables at Starbucks, apparently.

00:10:09.940 --> 00:10:10.740
 >> Oh, yeah.

00:10:10.740 --> 00:10:16.380
 >> And the reason for that is that people look less alone when seated alone at a round table.

00:10:16.380 --> 00:10:18.180
 >> Really? >> Yeah.

00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:20.700
 >> Yeah, that makes sense, because there's no obvious place for

00:10:20.700 --> 00:10:24.980
 other people to go, or as a square table I suppose, you want other people on the extra edges.

00:10:24.980 --> 00:10:25.980
 >> Yeah. >> So Gareth?

00:10:25.980 --> 00:10:27.740
 >> Yeah, so he was the nephew.

00:10:27.740 --> 00:10:29.020
 >> We don't know anything else about him.

00:10:29.020 --> 00:10:29.820
 >> No, there's quite a lot.

00:10:29.820 --> 00:10:31.420
 I mean, he's a big part of the story.

00:10:31.420 --> 00:10:35.980
 Actually, it's a bit unfair to say that he's the nephew and make that sound as a bad thing,

00:10:35.980 --> 00:10:39.860
 because actually quite a number of the other knights were nephews of Arthur as well.

00:10:39.860 --> 00:10:43.460
 >> Just because everyone got in on special favors, doesn't mean it's any better than the Gareth.

00:10:43.460 --> 00:10:44.780
 >> [LAUGH]

00:10:44.780 --> 00:10:49.940
 >> The only thing I know about him is that his nickname was Beaumont, which is Beaumont as a French word.

00:10:49.940 --> 00:10:54.740
 It's beautiful hands, which people teased him, saying, hey, pretty hands.

00:10:54.740 --> 00:10:55.740
 >> Teased, Gareth.

00:10:55.740 --> 00:10:56.740
 >> Yeah.

00:10:56.740 --> 00:11:01.500
 >> But that does imply that he's not getting his hands dirty by killing dragons and stuff.

00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:03.100
 >> Yeah, it does, yeah, yeah.

00:11:03.100 --> 00:11:04.900
 >> I think he was a kitchen assistant or something like that.

00:11:04.900 --> 00:11:05.900
 >> He was, yeah.

00:11:05.900 --> 00:11:06.900
 >> Is that right?

00:11:06.900 --> 00:11:07.900
 >> Yeah.

00:11:07.900 --> 00:11:09.420
 >> For a while when he was sort of undercover.

00:11:09.420 --> 00:11:13.940
 That sort of period where a really rich famous person goes into the slums and sees what it's

00:11:13.940 --> 00:11:14.940
 like to be a normal person.

00:11:14.940 --> 00:11:19.020
 >> Well, he was undercover with his massive shield and massive sword, which I mean.

00:11:19.020 --> 00:11:20.020
 >> Yes, exactly.

00:11:20.020 --> 00:11:22.420
 >> Peter the Great went undercover all the time.

00:11:22.420 --> 00:11:23.420
 >> Yeah.

00:11:23.420 --> 00:11:24.420
 >> He loved doing it, yeah.

00:11:24.420 --> 00:11:29.220
 >> He was about seven feet tall and clearly the Tsar of Russia, so it was very hard for

00:11:29.220 --> 00:11:30.220
 him to do it.

00:11:30.220 --> 00:11:33.740
 >> And he had a big group of people with him that didn't he, like, 30 people walking along

00:11:33.740 --> 00:11:34.740
 with him and he's going, nope.

00:11:34.740 --> 00:11:35.740
 I like not him.

00:11:35.740 --> 00:11:36.740
 >> Right, yeah.

00:11:36.740 --> 00:11:40.940
 >> But he went, he got a job in a shipbuilding yard and he would only answer to the name Peter

00:11:40.940 --> 00:11:41.940
 the Shipbuilder.

00:11:41.940 --> 00:11:46.140
 And he would bring him matters of state in the evenings after he finished building ships

00:11:46.140 --> 00:11:47.140
 for the day.

00:11:47.140 --> 00:11:48.140
 >> Wow.

00:11:48.140 --> 00:11:50.380
 >> And then he would say, he would sign a few documents and things and then he'd, yeah,

00:11:50.380 --> 00:11:55.420
 he's kind of got it wrong if he calls himself Peter, what ever he does.

00:11:55.420 --> 00:11:56.420
 >> Yeah.

00:11:56.420 --> 00:11:57.420
 >> Old habits die hard, basically.

00:11:57.420 --> 00:11:58.420
 Yeah, you can help it.

00:11:58.420 --> 00:12:00.420
 >> But I think people like pretended to not recognise him, didn't they?

00:12:00.420 --> 00:12:01.420
 >> Yeah.

00:12:01.420 --> 00:12:02.420
 >> You make him feel like he was.

00:12:02.420 --> 00:12:03.420
 Things are successful.

00:12:03.420 --> 00:12:04.420
 >> Yeah.

00:12:04.420 --> 00:12:09.100
 >> I guess it was easy to go undercover in the olden days, you know, pre-photography days.

00:12:09.100 --> 00:12:14.060
 There was a rumor in down at the time, wasn't there, that the way Marie Antoinette was captured

00:12:14.060 --> 00:12:16.460
 was because some recognised her from the coins.

00:12:16.460 --> 00:12:17.460
 >> Really?

00:12:17.460 --> 00:12:21.500
 >> And that's then reported to her to the authorities, and that's why her.

00:12:21.500 --> 00:12:22.500
 >> Yeah.

00:12:22.500 --> 00:12:23.500
 >> That's pretty funny idea.

00:12:23.500 --> 00:12:28.580
 Someone looking at the coin and then looking back at the coin, going, wait, excuse me Madame,

00:12:28.580 --> 00:12:30.500
 could you stand sideways for a minute?

00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:31.500
 >> [LAUGH]

00:12:31.500 --> 00:12:40.220
 >> Back two nights, what would you guys say at night tournaments in the Middle Ages?

00:12:40.220 --> 00:12:41.220
 What was the main sport?

00:12:41.220 --> 00:12:42.220
 >> Jasting.

00:12:42.220 --> 00:12:43.220
 >> No, it wasn't.

00:12:43.220 --> 00:12:45.220
 Jasting was always a side sport.

00:12:45.220 --> 00:12:50.100
 The main sport was always the Malay, which was the big group fight where all the nights

00:12:50.100 --> 00:12:51.860
 like galted towards each other had a group fight.

00:12:51.860 --> 00:12:52.860
 >> Like a melee, like her.

00:12:52.860 --> 00:12:54.540
 >> Yeah, so we get Malay from.

00:12:54.540 --> 00:12:55.540
 >> That's how it's supposed to be.

00:12:55.540 --> 00:12:57.740
 >> Jasting was always just a side of it.

00:12:57.740 --> 00:13:02.940
 >> So like a lot of rulers and people campaigned to get jousting band because they thought

00:13:02.940 --> 00:13:08.300
 it was distracted from the main Malay, and they thought it wasn't a necessary part.

00:13:08.300 --> 00:13:14.020
 And Count Philip of Flanders actually used to turn up with a whole retinue and decline

00:13:14.020 --> 00:13:17.980
 to join the Malay, and so make sure everyone else got in the Malay.

00:13:17.980 --> 00:13:20.460
 And then when he was jousting, he'd be able to win the joust because everyone was tired

00:13:20.460 --> 00:13:23.820
 from the Malay, and so people wanted to ban the jousting.

00:13:23.820 --> 00:13:26.700
 >> I think it's true that the only reason more people didn't get killed in the Malay was

00:13:26.700 --> 00:13:28.500
 because the main aim was to capture other people.

00:13:28.500 --> 00:13:29.500
 >> Oh, really?

00:13:29.500 --> 00:13:32.700
 >> And then you would sell them their armour back to them because it's very embarrassing.

00:13:32.700 --> 00:13:34.700
 They basically rent some of your armour from you.

00:13:34.700 --> 00:13:35.700
 >> Yeah.

00:13:35.700 --> 00:13:37.700
 >> Would they go in with a lance?

00:13:37.700 --> 00:13:39.700
 >> I don't know.

00:13:39.700 --> 00:13:40.700
 >> Lance a lot would.

00:13:40.700 --> 00:13:41.700
 >> Okay.

00:13:41.700 --> 00:13:43.940
 A lance a lot.

00:13:43.940 --> 00:13:47.620
 There's a guy called George Lancelot, he's in the news quite recently.

00:13:47.620 --> 00:13:51.500
 He's had 176 convictions for repeated swery outbursts.

00:13:51.500 --> 00:13:52.500
 >> Swery outbursts.

00:13:52.500 --> 00:13:59.980
 >> He's been arrested for abuse a few times, and he claims to suffer from personality disorder,

00:13:59.980 --> 00:14:05.100
 which makes him swear and run whenever he is out in public and he's been drinking.

00:14:05.100 --> 00:14:08.180
 And recently he was sent to prison for a short amount of time.

00:14:08.180 --> 00:14:13.300
 Because he was led from the dock in extra crown carts, he shouted, "I get less for burglary,

00:14:13.300 --> 00:14:14.300
 fuck off."

00:14:14.300 --> 00:14:16.300
 >> In his defence?

00:14:16.300 --> 00:14:17.300
 >> Yeah.

00:14:17.300 --> 00:14:18.300
 I've been drinking.

00:14:18.300 --> 00:14:25.100
 >> Have you guys heard of the game, King Arthur, or played, in fact?

00:14:25.100 --> 00:14:26.100
 >> No.

00:14:26.100 --> 00:14:31.100
 >> This was a game that sailors played in the 16th and 17th centuries.

00:14:31.100 --> 00:14:35.220
 So you'd let one crew member to play King Arthur, and he'd be dressed up in ridiculous robes

00:14:35.220 --> 00:14:39.180
 and apparently wear a wig made of rope, and then everyone else of the crew would have to

00:14:39.180 --> 00:14:43.300
 be formally introduced to this King Arthur, and they'd have to tip a bucket of freezing

00:14:43.300 --> 00:14:44.940
 cold water over his head.

00:14:44.940 --> 00:14:46.660
 >> So it's like the ice bucket challenge.

00:14:46.660 --> 00:14:47.660
 >> It's a bit like that.

00:14:47.660 --> 00:14:50.820
 But if you, when you tipped it over his head, and obviously I guess his reaction was quite

00:14:50.820 --> 00:14:54.460
 amusing, if you cracked a smile or a laugh, you had to swap places with him, and you had

00:14:54.460 --> 00:14:56.300
 to pick up the King Arthur character.

00:14:56.300 --> 00:14:57.300
 >> Wow.

00:14:57.300 --> 00:14:58.300
 That's great.

00:14:58.300 --> 00:14:59.300
 >> You only shouted.

00:14:59.300 --> 00:15:00.300
 He said, "Hail King Arthur."

00:15:00.300 --> 00:15:01.300
 Tipped a bucket over his head.

00:15:01.300 --> 00:15:02.300
 Have to keep a straight face.

00:15:02.300 --> 00:15:07.740
 I nominate Long John Silver.

00:15:07.740 --> 00:15:12.180
 >> So just back to the nights, very quickly, because I'm not of your country.

00:15:12.180 --> 00:15:15.420
 I didn't really get enough bringing totally with it.

00:15:15.420 --> 00:15:17.780
 Obviously you guys might have them guessing in school.

00:15:17.780 --> 00:15:18.780
 Was it a big part?

00:15:18.780 --> 00:15:19.780
 >> Bitnighted.

00:15:19.780 --> 00:15:20.780
 >> No, no, no.

00:15:20.780 --> 00:15:21.780
 Just King Arthur the whole mythology.

00:15:21.780 --> 00:15:22.780
 >> Not really.

00:15:22.780 --> 00:15:23.780
 >> Not really.

00:15:23.780 --> 00:15:24.780
 >> It's not true.

00:15:24.780 --> 00:15:25.780
 >> It's not true.

00:15:25.780 --> 00:15:26.780
 >> Yeah.

00:15:26.780 --> 00:15:27.780
 >> Okay.

00:15:27.780 --> 00:15:28.780
 >> I've seen the sword in the Stone Disney film.

00:15:28.780 --> 00:15:29.780
 >> Yes.

00:15:29.780 --> 00:15:30.780
 >> I haven't.

00:15:30.780 --> 00:15:31.780
 >> Oh, well, it's the best Disney film.

00:15:31.780 --> 00:15:33.780
 It's a really hot squirrel, isn't it?

00:15:33.780 --> 00:15:34.780
 >> That is true.

00:15:34.780 --> 00:15:35.780
 >> True, right?

00:15:35.780 --> 00:15:36.780
 >> It's pretty fit.

00:15:36.780 --> 00:15:37.780
 >> She is sexy.

00:15:37.780 --> 00:15:40.780
 >> Like the fox in Robin Hood, for example.

00:15:40.780 --> 00:15:42.780
 That was Robin Hood.

00:15:42.780 --> 00:15:43.780
 >> What?

00:15:43.780 --> 00:15:44.780
 Oh, yeah, yeah.

00:15:44.780 --> 00:15:45.780
 I'm sorry.

00:15:45.780 --> 00:15:46.780
 >> He's a handsome fox.

00:15:46.780 --> 00:15:48.780
 >> He's a handsome fox.

00:15:48.780 --> 00:15:49.780
 >> Yeah.

00:15:49.780 --> 00:15:52.780
 But so there's no basis of truth in it whatsoever, right?

00:15:52.780 --> 00:15:53.780
 >> There are certainly claims.

00:15:53.780 --> 00:15:59.420
 There's a claim that a huge round table that hangs in Winchester Hall is the real round

00:15:59.420 --> 00:16:00.420
 table.

00:16:00.420 --> 00:16:04.060
 So what happens is there's this mythology which most people think isn't true, but there

00:16:04.060 --> 00:16:07.580
 might be some kind of historical basis to it, probably not.

00:16:07.580 --> 00:16:11.380
 And so when you have anything like that, it means that everyone can claim part of it.

00:16:11.380 --> 00:16:12.380
 So --

00:16:12.380 --> 00:16:13.380
 >> Okay.

00:16:13.380 --> 00:16:16.020
 >> I think the latest theory is that -- so it's a bit like Robin Hood, I think, is that

00:16:16.020 --> 00:16:18.780
 people often come up with theories of where the Arthurian Legend might have come from.

00:16:18.780 --> 00:16:20.620
 And the latest is that he was Kazekstani.

00:16:20.620 --> 00:16:21.620
 >> Oh.

00:16:21.620 --> 00:16:22.620
 >> Really?

00:16:22.620 --> 00:16:23.620
 >> His mom interpretation.

00:16:23.620 --> 00:16:24.620
 Kazekstani King.

00:16:24.620 --> 00:16:27.620
 >> But he was a mythical Kazekstani King, as opposed to a mythical English King, is that

00:16:27.620 --> 00:16:28.620
 right?

00:16:28.620 --> 00:16:29.620
 >> I think so, yeah.

00:16:29.620 --> 00:16:35.140
 The theory that he's Croatian, because his wife was called Igrain, and there is a town

00:16:35.140 --> 00:16:39.180
 called Igrain in Croatia, and they've decided, well, it sounds the same so she must have been

00:16:39.180 --> 00:16:40.180
 from here.

00:16:40.180 --> 00:16:41.180
 >> Fair enough.

00:16:41.180 --> 00:16:46.660
 >> So just with the round table and Gareth specifically, it turns out that Gareth's death

00:16:46.660 --> 00:16:51.100
 is what led to the sort of breaking up of the round table of the night being their

00:16:51.100 --> 00:16:52.100
 oldest vine.

00:16:52.100 --> 00:16:53.100
 Yeah.

00:16:53.100 --> 00:16:54.100
 >> So they really did care about the little kitchen.

00:16:54.100 --> 00:16:55.100
 >> They loved Gareth.

00:16:55.100 --> 00:16:56.100
 Yeah.

00:16:56.100 --> 00:17:01.420
 >> He wasn't just the nepotistic nephew coming in, he was very much loved.

00:17:01.420 --> 00:17:05.540
 So Gareth, that was actually the first use of the name Gareth in recorded.

00:17:05.540 --> 00:17:09.300
 >> Yeah, I read one theory that it was a mistake by Mallory.

00:17:09.300 --> 00:17:10.300
 >> Oh.

00:17:10.300 --> 00:17:16.300
 >> Okay, he was supposed to be called Gahariat, but he'd misheard Gahariat and said Gareth-

00:17:16.300 --> 00:17:20.060
 >> I mean, it's not that much as Gareth and having the female name Hariat as the main

00:17:20.060 --> 00:17:23.140
 part of your male name to be there.

00:17:23.140 --> 00:17:27.220
 >> So do you think we could say that Gareth, in the same way that like Joe Anna is the female

00:17:27.220 --> 00:17:30.740
 version of Joseph or whatever, Josephine, probably, do you think we could say that Gareth

00:17:30.740 --> 00:17:32.260
 is the male version of Hariat?

00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:37.980
 >> I could think of a better male equivalent of Hariat than Gareth.

00:17:37.980 --> 00:17:38.980
 It's taken me a while.

00:17:38.980 --> 00:17:39.980
 I don't know.

00:17:39.980 --> 00:17:40.980
 [LAUGHTER]

00:17:40.980 --> 00:17:42.980
 >> I don't know what you're talking about.

00:17:42.980 --> 00:17:45.980
 It must be really obscure name.

00:17:45.980 --> 00:17:53.260
 >> Let's move on to fact number three, and that is Andrew Hunter Murray.

00:17:53.260 --> 00:17:59.220
 My fact is that the Ministry of Defence owns 15 gold courses, this is the British Ministry

00:17:59.220 --> 00:18:00.220
 of Defence.

00:18:00.220 --> 00:18:01.220
 >> Right.

00:18:01.220 --> 00:18:02.220
 >> Yeah.

00:18:02.220 --> 00:18:03.220
 >> Why do we know why?

00:18:03.220 --> 00:18:04.220
 >> Why not?

00:18:04.220 --> 00:18:09.620
 It's hard work killing the enemies of the crown as you can't relax and have a quick

00:18:09.620 --> 00:18:10.620
 nine.

00:18:10.620 --> 00:18:15.300
 >> I think it's because you know when you watch a James Bond movie, and I know Ministry

00:18:15.300 --> 00:18:19.940
 of Defence is different MI6s, but they must have their spies as well, right, Ministry

00:18:19.940 --> 00:18:20.940
 of Defence.

00:18:20.940 --> 00:18:24.260
 Whenever you see James Bond movie, Bond is brilliant at everything.

00:18:24.260 --> 00:18:26.660
 You don't become brilliant at everything without training like crazy.

00:18:26.660 --> 00:18:27.660
 >> Good at golf.

00:18:27.660 --> 00:18:28.660
 >> Yeah.

00:18:28.660 --> 00:18:29.660
 >> Well, golf would be one of the things.

00:18:29.660 --> 00:18:32.060
 There will be a Bond movie when he plays golf, and he just --

00:18:32.060 --> 00:18:33.060
 >> He plays against a golf finger.

00:18:33.060 --> 00:18:34.060
 >> Well, there you go.

00:18:34.060 --> 00:18:38.500
 >> You assume down at the Ministry of Defence also owns loads of tennis courts and bowling

00:18:38.500 --> 00:18:39.500
 alleys.

00:18:39.500 --> 00:18:46.540
 >> I think I read that they do have like polo, poke tables, ski resorts, they've got a

00:18:46.540 --> 00:18:53.300
 dart board, they've got a dart board, they've got one spy waiting for the evil villain who

00:18:53.300 --> 00:18:57.340
 plays shoved hate me.

00:18:57.340 --> 00:19:02.860
 >> I want to see the inventory of everything that's red foot green.

00:19:02.860 --> 00:19:15.220
 >> He's saying red foot green, red foot, red foot, red foot, red foot, red foot.

00:19:15.220 --> 00:19:18.660
 >> Another thing the Ministry of Defence has is, this is in their list of achievements

00:19:18.660 --> 00:19:25.540
 for 2014, completed a rollout of Internet Explorer 8 as its default browser.

00:19:25.540 --> 00:19:29.540
 >> Not bad, that is.

00:19:29.540 --> 00:19:34.220
 >> Still on Internet Explorer, not only that Internet Explorer 8 came out in 2009.

00:19:34.220 --> 00:19:35.220
 >> Wow.

00:19:35.220 --> 00:19:38.180
 >> Have you heard of Kabul Golf Club?

00:19:38.180 --> 00:19:39.180
 >> No.

00:19:39.180 --> 00:19:43.460
 >> This is the only golf club in the whole of Afghanistan.

00:19:43.460 --> 00:19:44.460
 >> Right.

00:19:44.460 --> 00:19:49.340
 >> And the course rules specifically call the Greens Browns, because it's very, very dry

00:19:49.340 --> 00:19:50.340
 and there's no grass.

00:19:50.340 --> 00:19:51.340
 >> Oh, really?

00:19:51.340 --> 00:19:55.820
 >> It's all, basically, it's all sand, but they make the Greens more compact, don't they?

00:19:55.820 --> 00:19:56.820
 >> Yeah.

00:19:56.820 --> 00:19:57.820
 I think.

00:19:57.820 --> 00:20:01.140
 >> It used to be an area for training in the removal of mines.

00:20:01.140 --> 00:20:05.860
 And you have to carry artificial turf with you sometimes, put that on the ground where

00:20:05.860 --> 00:20:10.700
 your ball is, and play off that to the next bit, and then carry your artificial turf with

00:20:10.700 --> 00:20:11.700
 you.

00:20:11.700 --> 00:20:12.700
 >> That happens under the ball.

00:20:12.700 --> 00:20:16.980
 >> That happens in actual, not like professional golf, but if you remember of a golf course,

00:20:16.980 --> 00:20:22.060
 some golf courses in the UK, you'll carry some artificial turf really in the winter,

00:20:22.060 --> 00:20:26.260
 because they don't want you hacking up the margin, you're on a bit of artificial stuff,

00:20:26.260 --> 00:20:28.420
 put it down, put the ball on, and play it off that.

00:20:28.420 --> 00:20:29.420
 >> That's fantastic.

00:20:29.420 --> 00:20:30.420
 >> Yeah.

00:20:30.420 --> 00:20:31.420
 >> I think that's really cool.

00:20:31.420 --> 00:20:32.420
 >> Yeah.

00:20:32.420 --> 00:20:34.420
 >> So what the first crazy golf course was?

00:20:34.420 --> 00:20:35.420
 >> No.

00:20:35.420 --> 00:20:39.980
 >> It was, it's still around, it's St Andrews, and it's a putting green, and it's got loads

00:20:39.980 --> 00:20:43.780
 of real big hills on it, so the ball goes in all sorts of directions.

00:20:43.780 --> 00:20:47.940
 And it was invented because ladies weren't allowed to play on the golf course, so they gave

00:20:47.940 --> 00:20:51.860
 them this little fake golf course to play.

00:20:51.860 --> 00:20:55.700
 And then it became so popular, because actually it's a lot more fun than proper golf.

00:20:55.700 --> 00:20:56.700
 >> Yeah.

00:20:56.700 --> 00:20:59.100
 >> If you're not good at golf, and that everyone starts to play in it.

00:20:59.100 --> 00:21:01.020
 >> And then they kick the women off that one as well.

00:21:01.020 --> 00:21:04.300
 >> No, no, no, no, you can play this tiny golf, you've just invented.

00:21:04.300 --> 00:21:05.700
 >> For your fingers.

00:21:05.700 --> 00:21:10.420
 >> A little cocktail stick for a golf club.

00:21:10.420 --> 00:21:11.420
 >> That's so funny.

00:21:11.420 --> 00:21:15.060
 >> It's true Mary Queen of Scots, first female golfer in records.

00:21:15.060 --> 00:21:16.060
 >> Yeah, that is true.

00:21:16.060 --> 00:21:17.060
 >> Wow.

00:21:17.060 --> 00:21:18.060
 >> Records, though, tricky things.

00:21:18.060 --> 00:21:19.380
 But yeah, I think it is.

00:21:19.380 --> 00:21:23.020
 And I think James IV of Scotland was the first recorded golf player.

00:21:23.020 --> 00:21:25.260
 Again, he definitely wasn't the first ever golf player.

00:21:25.260 --> 00:21:26.260
 But yeah.

00:21:26.260 --> 00:21:27.980
 >> He played in 1502.

00:21:27.980 --> 00:21:34.380
 He lifted the band that had previously been in place on playing golf because it was encouraged

00:21:34.380 --> 00:21:35.780
 to encourage archery practice.

00:21:35.780 --> 00:21:38.700
 Golf was not allowed, because you know, if you can't play golf, James, as you know.

00:21:38.700 --> 00:21:40.780
 >> Yeah, his grandfather banned it, didn't he?

00:21:40.780 --> 00:21:41.780
 >> Yeah.

00:21:41.780 --> 00:21:42.780
 >> So.

00:21:42.780 --> 00:21:44.740
 >> Probably part of the reason that he lifted the band was he realized that Cannon would

00:21:44.740 --> 00:21:47.980
 probably replace archers in time, so it wasn't as important for everyone to be doing

00:21:47.980 --> 00:21:48.980
 archery practice.

00:21:48.980 --> 00:21:51.340
 It was a long-sighted, yeah.

00:21:51.340 --> 00:21:56.620
 >> Quite a lot of famous people in history have been known for playing golf, haven't they?

00:21:56.620 --> 00:22:01.700
 Like I think Rugged Kipling was a big golf fan, and it's claimed that Rugged Kipling, I mean,

00:22:01.700 --> 00:22:05.740
 it's true that Rugged Kipling invented snow golf, but it's often claimed like this is a

00:22:05.740 --> 00:22:07.540
 sport that now we're all playing.

00:22:07.540 --> 00:22:10.580
 And did you know that the Rugged Kipling invented it?

00:22:10.580 --> 00:22:11.580
 >> I'm almost constant.

00:22:11.580 --> 00:22:12.580
 He's getting a bit out of hand actually.

00:22:12.580 --> 00:22:14.580
 I don't know how to snow golf, I play.

00:22:14.580 --> 00:22:16.980
 >> Snow golf didn't do any archery anymore.

00:22:16.980 --> 00:22:20.820
 >> Okay, so there was a golfer in Benine called Matthew Boyer.

00:22:20.820 --> 00:22:25.340
 >> Okay, this might be a made-up story, but it's all obvious on it.

00:22:25.340 --> 00:22:29.020
 One day he played a shot, described as a glorious slice.

00:22:29.020 --> 00:22:34.260
 The ball hit a bird, which in turn dropped onto the windshield of a trainer jet.

00:22:34.260 --> 00:22:40.460
 That trainer jet pilot then swerved out of the way and took out four new Mirage jets.

00:22:40.460 --> 00:22:47.260
 And in one goal, totally demolished the entire air force of Benine through one golf shot.

00:22:47.260 --> 00:22:48.260
 That's what happened.

00:22:48.260 --> 00:22:49.660
 >> That is impressive.

00:22:49.660 --> 00:22:54.260
 They worked out it would take him 145,000 years to pay off his debt.

00:22:54.260 --> 00:22:55.380
 >> Did he yell out in the court?

00:22:55.380 --> 00:22:56.780
 I would have got less of a bergerory?

00:22:56.780 --> 00:22:57.620
 >> Fuck off.

00:22:57.620 --> 00:23:01.660
 >> I could be a cool catcher, it's relieving court every time.

00:23:01.660 --> 00:23:07.900
 [MUSIC]

00:23:07.900 --> 00:23:12.100
 >> Okay, time for our final fact, and that is Chazinski.

00:23:12.100 --> 00:23:16.940
 >> My effect is that the rise in the use of female contraceptive pills is causing fish

00:23:16.940 --> 00:23:19.300
 to become too effeminate.

00:23:19.300 --> 00:23:20.780
 This is a genuine problem.

00:23:20.780 --> 00:23:26.380
 This is about how the lot of women use a female contraceptive pill, understandably, it's a great thing.

00:23:26.380 --> 00:23:32.220
 But that does mean that we end up flushing out of our system, a lot of female hormones.

00:23:32.220 --> 00:23:35.860
 That go into the drains and get into rivers, and the fish take them in.

00:23:35.860 --> 00:23:41.700
 And it causes this thing called intersex, which means that like a male fish will stop producing sperm.

00:23:41.700 --> 00:23:47.940
 It'll start producing eggs, and then it damages fish populations because it's thought they can't really breed as well when they stop doing that.

00:23:47.940 --> 00:23:51.580
 So, yeah, bit of an issue, stuff being flushed down the drain.

00:23:51.580 --> 00:23:52.260
 >> Huge issue, yeah.

00:23:52.260 --> 00:23:57.620
 >> How can there be that much that's going into the fish hanging out by the source of the sewer?

00:23:57.620 --> 00:24:01.420
 >> It's a good point, so yeah, it does take the tiniest amount to have an effect on them.

00:24:01.420 --> 00:24:11.460
 So they added its EE2, which is ethanol estradiol, which is the main active ingredient of contraceptive pills, which triggers the condition in fish.

00:24:11.460 --> 00:24:17.700
 And so they added five parts of that per trillion to water to test it out, and it still had an effect on the fish.

00:24:17.700 --> 00:24:19.620
 >> Wow, that's extraordinary.

00:24:19.620 --> 00:24:20.580
 >> That's right on out.

00:24:20.580 --> 00:24:27.060
 >> So I was just other things that go through the drain systems and out in the ocean.

00:24:27.060 --> 00:24:33.660
 I was talking to this lady from the Natural History Museum, Sandy Napp, and she's actually, it's not relevant.

00:24:33.660 --> 00:24:38.540
 She's a curator of potatoes and tomatoes, but what I'm talking about is facial products.

00:24:38.540 --> 00:24:42.140
 She was telling me, she gave me this little vial of these little blue beads.

00:24:42.140 --> 00:24:46.340
 And she was saying these beads are from, when you wash your face, with face washes.

00:24:46.340 --> 00:24:48.580
 Those microbeads that they say they're inside the thing.

00:24:48.580 --> 00:24:50.260
 And she was saying, what do you think these are made of?

00:24:50.260 --> 00:24:54.020
 And I assumed it's a natural product, and she said no, it's a little bit of plastic.

00:24:54.020 --> 00:24:59.220
 And the plastic is now apparently when it goes through the drains, that gets forced down to the ocean.

00:24:59.220 --> 00:25:02.660
 It makes it through the system, fish are eating it, becoming toxic.

00:25:02.660 --> 00:25:04.580
 It's actually poisoning the fish.

00:25:04.580 --> 00:25:06.620
 And then when you eat the fish, it's actually harming us now.

00:25:06.620 --> 00:25:08.980
 It's apparently it knocks up radiation levels or something.

00:25:08.980 --> 00:25:09.780
 I don't, yeah.

00:25:09.780 --> 00:25:11.580
 I've probably gone all pseudoe there at the end.

00:25:11.580 --> 00:25:13.020
 >> And that's in moisturizer?

00:25:13.020 --> 00:25:14.260
 >> It's in like a face wash.

00:25:14.260 --> 00:25:18.900
 >> You know, if you buy, if you buy face wash, and it's kind of a bit rough.

00:25:18.900 --> 00:25:23.220
 >> You know, and when you buy face wash, you know, when you wash your face.

00:25:23.220 --> 00:25:24.100
 >> Never done that.

00:25:24.100 --> 00:25:26.380
 Humans are paying for their vanity now, aren't they?

00:25:26.380 --> 00:25:28.540
 >> You said that, like you weren't a human.

00:25:28.540 --> 00:25:34.220
 >> New people will suffer puny morpals.

00:25:34.220 --> 00:25:39.220
 >> So industrial pollutants are shrinking the genitals of polar bears in Greenland.

00:25:39.220 --> 00:25:40.380
 >> That's their excuse.

00:25:40.380 --> 00:25:44.060
 >> They should just inflate down the cold, shouldn't they?

00:25:44.060 --> 00:25:50.580
 >> But apparently weakening their penis bones and industrial pollutants.

00:25:50.580 --> 00:25:55.900
 >> Yeah, and also there's a chemical used to paint boats on the western coast of Australia

00:25:55.900 --> 00:25:58.140
 called TBT.

00:25:58.140 --> 00:26:02.700
 And that causes female sea snails to grow male sex organs on the heads.

00:26:02.700 --> 00:26:03.700
 >> Wow.

00:26:03.700 --> 00:26:05.300
 >> That is pretty comfortable.

00:26:05.300 --> 00:26:06.940
 >> That's an on mutation, yeah.

00:26:06.940 --> 00:26:07.940
 >> Yeah.

00:26:07.940 --> 00:26:08.940
 >> It's a funny one.

00:26:08.940 --> 00:26:13.020
 >> The good news is that the percentage of snails with the penis on the foreheads is

00:26:13.020 --> 00:26:19.500
 going down, and the size of the penis is shrinking thanks to a decreasing proportion of chemical

00:26:19.500 --> 00:26:20.980
 in the water.

00:26:20.980 --> 00:26:22.180
 >> That is good news.

00:26:22.180 --> 00:26:27.940
 >> I think we all know what the most common insult is in the snail population there, isn't

00:26:27.940 --> 00:26:28.940
 me?

00:26:28.940 --> 00:26:31.940
 >> It's a pretty straightforward one.

00:26:31.940 --> 00:26:38.860
 >> So another fish that would change sex is Nemo from the film Finding Nemo.

00:26:38.860 --> 00:26:39.860
 >> Okay.

00:26:39.860 --> 00:26:42.300
 >> Did you know about this clown fish?

00:26:42.300 --> 00:26:49.420
 >> I mean, if the story went as a proper clown fish life cycle does, Nemo would hatch as

00:26:49.420 --> 00:26:52.900
 a hermaphrodite, because all clown fish are born in heraphrodites.

00:26:52.900 --> 00:26:58.460
 And when the female mate dies, Nemo's father would have turned into a female.

00:26:58.460 --> 00:27:03.900
 Now, because Nemo is the only other clown fish around in this setting of the film, he would

00:27:03.900 --> 00:27:09.220
 then become a male and mate with his now female father, unless his father dies, in which

00:27:09.220 --> 00:27:12.340
 case he changes into a female and goes off with another male.

00:27:12.340 --> 00:27:15.260
 >> I haven't seen this movie, is that not what happens?

00:27:15.260 --> 00:27:16.460
 >> That's pretty much it.

00:27:16.460 --> 00:27:18.900
 >> He's an extended director, isn't he?

00:27:18.900 --> 00:27:24.540
 >> I did read that the mother of Nemo dies after four minutes and three seconds of finding

00:27:24.540 --> 00:27:25.540
 Nemo, right?

00:27:25.540 --> 00:27:26.540
 >> Yeah.

00:27:26.540 --> 00:27:27.540
 >> Eat and buy a baracuda, apparently?

00:27:27.540 --> 00:27:28.540
 >> Yep.

00:27:28.540 --> 00:27:29.540
 >> But this was in a story.

00:27:29.540 --> 00:27:30.540
 >> Boy, don't relax.

00:27:30.540 --> 00:27:31.540
 Boy, don't relax.

00:27:31.540 --> 00:27:35.940
 >> Those who've only made it two minutes in.

00:27:35.940 --> 00:27:40.920
 >> So this was in an article that says that two thirds of children's animated films contain

00:27:40.920 --> 00:27:46.300
 an on-screen death of an important character, compared with only half of comparison films.

00:27:46.300 --> 00:27:49.760
 So there are more deaths in children's films than there are in the other films.

00:27:49.760 --> 00:27:55.300
 So basically it's either a dead parent, a single parent, or a mother who turns into a father

00:27:55.300 --> 00:27:58.380
 who turns into a mother who has sex with a child.

00:27:58.380 --> 00:28:01.100
 It's usually one of those plot lives on the three classic.

00:28:01.100 --> 00:28:05.180
 >> That is a fully functioning fish family, that you just described.

00:28:05.180 --> 00:28:09.940
 So on finding Nemo, there's a book that's just come out I think, which is called Water,

00:28:09.940 --> 00:28:13.620
 the Past, Present, and Future, which is quite interesting.

00:28:13.620 --> 00:28:18.420
 And that states that one of the reasons that finding Nemo is set in Sydney is that Sydney

00:28:18.420 --> 00:28:20.540
 is one of the only places in the world.

00:28:20.540 --> 00:28:26.220
 So one of only three English-speaking places in the world where you could flush a fish down

00:28:26.220 --> 00:28:32.180
 a drain, and it would make it to the sea without dying because the others are going to get

00:28:32.180 --> 00:28:36.260
 ground up and crush the death in various sewage treatment bars.

00:28:36.260 --> 00:28:40.380
 Yeah, in fact, there was panic when finding Nemo was released that kids were going to start

00:28:40.380 --> 00:28:42.340
 doing this to their fish to free them.

00:28:42.340 --> 00:28:46.100
 And so they released a statement saying actually a better title for this film would have been

00:28:46.100 --> 00:28:50.940
 grinding Nemo because actually if you do this to a fish, it will end up crushed.

00:28:50.940 --> 00:28:52.540
 >> Wait, who released that statement?

00:28:52.540 --> 00:28:56.180
 >> It was the national pun or a trait for you to move them.

00:28:56.180 --> 00:28:57.180
 >> It was set.

00:28:57.180 --> 00:28:58.700
 >> It wasn't at all right, it's group.

00:28:58.700 --> 00:29:00.340
 >> No, it was someone involved with the film.

00:29:00.340 --> 00:29:01.340
 >> Oh, okay.

00:29:01.340 --> 00:29:04.740
 >> It was helpful though, because children don't normally read a lot of statements.

00:29:04.740 --> 00:29:07.780
 Well, I appreciate a good pun in the title of them.

00:29:07.780 --> 00:29:11.740
 So apparently there was a rise in parents calling plumbers going, how do I get my fish out?

00:29:11.740 --> 00:29:13.740
 We've flushed it down, is it going to be saved?

00:29:13.740 --> 00:29:14.740
 >> Really?

00:29:14.740 --> 00:29:15.740
 >> Yeah, yeah.

00:29:15.740 --> 00:29:16.940
 Because children were just doing it.

00:29:16.940 --> 00:29:20.220
 >> And there was, and also a lot of children, even though it doesn't exactly like hold up

00:29:20.220 --> 00:29:25.500
 the virtues of owning a clownfish because he does just escape, there was a problem with

00:29:25.500 --> 00:29:29.380
 kids suddenly wanting clownfish, and I think there was a certain sea that they were

00:29:29.380 --> 00:29:32.580
 just taken from where it was empty to build clownfish.

00:29:32.580 --> 00:29:33.580
 >> Really?

00:29:33.580 --> 00:29:34.580
 >> Yeah.

00:29:34.580 --> 00:29:35.580
 >> The damn selfish.

00:29:35.580 --> 00:29:36.580
 >> I don't know.

00:29:36.580 --> 00:29:39.780
 >> No, that's actually the group of fish that clownfish are called damn selfish.

00:29:39.780 --> 00:29:40.780
 It's not a cool name.

00:29:40.780 --> 00:29:41.780
 >> The damn selfish.

00:29:41.780 --> 00:29:42.780
 >> The damn selfish.

00:29:42.780 --> 00:29:43.780
 >> Wait, damn.

00:29:43.780 --> 00:29:44.780
 >> D-A-M selfish.

00:29:44.780 --> 00:29:45.780
 >> One word.

00:29:45.780 --> 00:29:46.780
 >> Oh, damn selfish.

00:29:46.780 --> 00:29:47.780
 >> I say it.

00:29:47.780 --> 00:29:48.780
 >> [LAUGH]

00:29:48.780 --> 00:29:49.780
 [LAUGH]

00:29:49.780 --> 00:29:50.780
 >> That's good.

00:29:50.780 --> 00:29:51.780
 >> Yeah, well done.

00:29:51.780 --> 00:29:58.820
 >> Quick question, why do people flush old fish down the toilet and not eat them?

00:29:58.820 --> 00:30:00.620
 >> [LAUGH]

00:30:00.620 --> 00:30:01.620
 >> That's the only two options.

00:30:01.620 --> 00:30:06.420
 >> What, I just care for some reason that people bury their dogs and don't eat them?

00:30:06.420 --> 00:30:08.420
 >> Yeah, but we eat fish.

00:30:08.420 --> 00:30:09.420
 We don't eat dogs.

00:30:09.420 --> 00:30:10.420
 >> Okay, good point.

00:30:10.420 --> 00:30:12.420
 >> There's fresh fish in the house now.

00:30:12.420 --> 00:30:14.020
 >> There are so many reasons for James.

00:30:14.020 --> 00:30:16.020
 >> Right, here's one good reason.

00:30:16.020 --> 00:30:17.020
 >> Yeah.

00:30:17.020 --> 00:30:19.220
 >> If your fish has just died, you don't know what it died of.

00:30:19.220 --> 00:30:21.020
 It could have died of a disease or something.

00:30:21.020 --> 00:30:22.020
 >> Okay.

00:30:22.020 --> 00:30:23.020
 >> So you won't want to eat it in that way.

00:30:23.020 --> 00:30:24.020
 >> Yeah, but that's one extreme.

00:30:24.020 --> 00:30:27.620
 >> That's not the reason I didn't eat my hamster, for example.

00:30:27.620 --> 00:30:28.620
 >> Right.

00:30:28.620 --> 00:30:32.020
 >> Also, I don't ask for a certificate of death when I'm in a restaurant.

00:30:32.020 --> 00:30:33.020
 >> Well, it's a habit.

00:30:33.020 --> 00:30:36.620
 >> Okay, you don't understand, don't you, that the restaurants have asked for that?

00:30:36.620 --> 00:30:42.220
 At some point, the restaurants have to go through a process where they make sure their fish are healthy to eat.

00:30:42.220 --> 00:30:44.020
 >> It was kind of dead animals.

00:30:44.020 --> 00:30:45.620
 >> [LAUGH]

00:30:45.620 --> 00:30:47.620
 >> You've seen those big ads in the newspapers.

00:30:47.620 --> 00:30:48.820
 We buy dead fish.

00:30:48.820 --> 00:30:51.020
 [LAUGH]

00:30:51.020 --> 00:30:52.420
 >> Cash for dead fish.

00:30:52.420 --> 00:30:54.220
 [LAUGH]

00:30:54.220 --> 00:30:55.420
 >> Cash for the old fish.

00:30:55.420 --> 00:30:59.620
 [LAUGH]

00:30:59.620 --> 00:31:02.220
 >> It just seems you're throwing away food.

00:31:02.220 --> 00:31:10.620
 >> One story I like about finding Nemo is that when Andrew Stanton who had the big star had the idea and pitched it to the head of Pixar, John Lasseter.

00:31:10.620 --> 00:31:16.220
 He did it in a session that lasted over an hour and he had lots of visual aids and character voices and it really tied him out.

00:31:16.220 --> 00:31:20.020
 He says, and at the end of it was like, oh, Lasseter, what do you think?

00:31:20.020 --> 00:31:22.020
 And Lasseter just went, you had me at fish.

00:31:22.020 --> 00:31:25.220
 >> [LAUGH]

00:31:25.220 --> 00:31:28.220
 >> Okay, so some stuff on contraceptives.

00:31:28.220 --> 00:31:35.820
 Maybe sponges were used as contraceptives in the 1800s and 1900s.

00:31:35.820 --> 00:31:38.420
 They would use them with spermicides.

00:31:38.420 --> 00:31:41.620
 >> Okay, what I'm putting them into.

00:31:41.620 --> 00:31:49.420
 >> Yeah, so they would be used with things like quinine and olive oil and that would possibly be a contraceptive, yeah.

00:31:49.420 --> 00:31:52.620
 And some even doubled as household cleaners.

00:31:52.620 --> 00:32:00.020
 And one was advertised as a dual treatment for successful womanhood, which means contraception, and athletes foot.

00:32:00.020 --> 00:32:02.620
 >> [LAUGH] >> Two for one.

00:32:02.620 --> 00:32:04.820
 >> I don't know which order you'd want to do that.

00:32:04.820 --> 00:32:09.020
 >> I do, I say, now my athletes foot is clear up.

00:32:09.020 --> 00:32:11.420
 >> [LAUGH] >> But I have 20 children.

00:32:11.420 --> 00:32:14.220
 >> [LAUGH]
