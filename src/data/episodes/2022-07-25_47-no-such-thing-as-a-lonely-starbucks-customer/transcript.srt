00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:12,680
 Hello and welcome to another episode.

3
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:15,600
 A nice such thing as a fish, a weekly podcast coming to you

4
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:17,840
 from the QI offices in Covern Garden.

5
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:18,840
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

6
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:21,720
 I'm sitting here with Anichezinski, Andy Murray, and James

7
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:22,220
 Harkin.

8
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:24,400
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones

9
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:27,200
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days.

10
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:29,400
 And in no particular order, here we go.

11
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:30,680
 [MUSIC]

12
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:34,320
 Starting with fact number one, and that is James.

13
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:37,480
 >> Okay, my fact this week is that according to a 2011

14
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:43,080
 Yugov survey, 27% of Britons neither love nor hate Marmite.

15
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:44,120
 >> I love that.

16
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:45,520
 >> That makes a lot of sense.

17
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:46,640
 >> It is a great fact.

18
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:47,320
 >> I really love it.

19
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:48,320
 >> I think that's 27% I think.

20
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:49,520
 >> I think I am too.

21
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,160
 >> I love it, I love it.

22
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:52,000
 >> Yeah.

23
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,080
 >> But here's a weird one.

24
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:57,920
 I love Vegemite, but I hate Marmite when you take the comparison higher.

25
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:00,480
 >> So you would obviously love Vegemite, because you're Australian.

26
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,520
 But I actually prefer Vegemites of Marmite.

27
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:05,400
 And I think I'm probably the only British person who would admit to that.

28
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,480
 It's just better, guys.

29
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:11,280
 >> Well, I read an extraordinary story that IBM did a global survey of the most

30
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,560
 talked about brands online.

31
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:16,960
 And they went through the internet scouring it for the most brands that were spoken about.

32
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:22,600
 And the top brand, higher than Coke, higher than Nike, was Vegemite.

33
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:23,440
 >> Really?

34
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:25,360
 >> More spoken about than any other brand.

35
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:28,440
 You don't need to speak about Coke because it's always going to be like that.

36
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:29,400
 >> Yeah, it could be that.

37
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:35,640
 And the weird thing is that they tracked it down that 98% of Vegemite eaters are all Australian.

38
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:36,720
 >> How many, what percent, are you?

39
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:37,720
 >> 98%.

40
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:38,840
 >> Well, that sounds right.

41
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,240
 >> Well, I don't think you can buy it anywhere else.

42
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:41,520
 >> You can get it overseas now.

43
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,160
 You can get it in the supermarkets here.

44
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:47,240
 But so what's even more interesting is that it wasn't like they were tracking it to Australia.

45
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:48,880
 They were tracking it globally.

46
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:51,960
 So they know where all the Australians are around the world.

47
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:52,960
 >> Wow.

48
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,920
 >> Through Vegemite consumption.

49
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,400
 >> Yeah, that's really great.

50
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,240
 >> I mean, that's not obviously all the Australians.

51
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:02,280
 But it's like, it's just, it gives you a great map of how spread out Aussies are around the world.

52
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:04,800
 >> You could probably do the same with British and baked beans.

53
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,120
 >> Yes, yeah.

54
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:10,200
 >> Although Vegemite is now really popular in certain Asian countries, like in Hong Kong,

55
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:13,040
 it's all sold out in Hong Kong from all supermarkets suddenly.

56
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:16,440
 And that was when it was connected to umami flavor.

57
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:20,120
 So there was like a little press around it at some point, which said that is the umami flavor.

58
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:25,520
 Because that's, you know, hailed as a brilliant flavor in particularly in Japan and Hong Kong.

59
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,080
 Suddenly it's incredibly popular.

60
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:27,800
 >> Wow.

61
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:31,080
 >> Right. Hey guys, are we talking about Vegemite on this podcast?

62
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,920
 Or are we talking about James' fact about mami?

63
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:38,160
 >> My fact is about mami, so don't bring your Australian waves up in here.

64
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,040
 >> I didn't know it's got celery in it.

65
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:40,560
 >> That's it?

66
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,360
 >> Yeah.

67
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,480
 >> Mami is made with celery.

68
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,360
 >> Wow, that must have been so good for you.

69
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,240
 >> Yes.

70
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:45,800
 >> Excellent.

71
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:48,880
 >> It also has like the remnants of beer in it, doesn't it?

72
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:52,320
 That's what it's made of, it's like the extract from the beer making.

73
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:55,520
 >> Is it still, well, probably not anymore, but that's where it originally came from.

74
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:57,680
 >> If you've got yeast left over, you may as well use it for a little while.

75
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,960
 >> Yeah, I want to know, it's not drunk after breakfast.

76
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:03,120
 >> That's because you have a serious problem in it.

77
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,800
 It's because you're always drinking a breakfast.

78
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,720
 I don't think it's the mami.

79
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,640
 It gives the pine pine to wine if you're having good.

80
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:11,520
 >> I don't blame the mami.

81
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,360
 >> I think I must have had a bad slice of mami.

82
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:18,840
 >> There was speaking of drinking, they released on Valentine's Day.

83
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:22,840
 In 2008, they released champagne flavored mami.

84
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:25,360
 >> I don't remember that, and it had 3% champagne in it.

85
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:31,240
 Now, I would have thought that the mami would overpower the 3% of champagne.

86
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:33,680
 >> Mami's a famously mild flavor.

87
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:36,120
 >> Mami, do you know what it means?

88
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:39,480
 It means our mami is an old French cooking pot.

89
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:44,240
 So, you know the front of a mami jar, there is the little picture of a red and yellow.

90
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,320
 >> Yeah, of a casserole dish.

91
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,800
 >> Of a casserole dish, that is a mami.

92
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:51,680
 >> Yeah, it's because it was originally made to add a little bit of extra to casseroles.

93
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,400
 That was the point of mami in the first place.

94
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:53,920
 >> Oh, really?

95
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,360
 >> Yeah, flavor.

96
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,600
 >> Yeah, it's like a stock cube or something like that.

97
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:04,800
 Because it was invented by the same guy who invented oxo cubes who was called Justus von Liebig.

98
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:12,000
 And he was the first person who realized that you could take the yeast extracts and turn it into something you could eat.

99
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,360
 But he is also known as the father of the fertilizer industry.

100
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:18,720
 Because he discovered that nitrogen is essential for plants.

101
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:22,800
 And he also developed a breast milk substitute for babies.

102
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:23,680
 >> Wow, wow.

103
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,760
 >> So, he taught this guy, yeah, yeah, yeah.

104
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:30,760
 >> So, hang on, archetype of the British mami was invented by, was he German?

105
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:32,040
 >> Justus von Liebig sounds German.

106
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,880
 >> Yeah, I think he was actually.

107
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:39,240
 I think his main manufacturing place was in Freybentos, which is in Uruguay as well.

108
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,320
 >> Yeah, why do you call it mami?

109
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:44,280
 He should call it justice, so he could say justice will be served and breakfast.

110
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:49,680
 >> Why do you want this mami thing to even?

111
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,160
 >> So, was his breast milk substitute mami?

112
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,600
 >> That's what it was.

113
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,080
 >> You just claim to have invented it.

114
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,760
 >> I mean, invented a delicious ability.

115
00:04:58,760 --> 00:04:59,920
 >> It's a mami shot.

116
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:02,400
 >> And a fantastic new hemorrhoid crepe.

117
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,640
 >> Right.

118
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:11,400
 >> There are a lot of articles I'd like about mami, because it's something that people like talking about.

119
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:15,240
 And I read this phrase, mami, one, two world wars.

120
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:17,080
 Okay, that's not strictly true.

121
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:22,400
 It's the fastest climb down from the assertion of a fact I've ever read.

122
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,120
 And that was on a BBC article about it.

123
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:27,440
 >> But what they mean was it was in Soldiers Rations in the First World War.

124
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,480
 >> Yeah.

125
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:33,640
 >> Because you would get spammed condensed milk and mami basically didn't you?

126
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:34,320
 >> That's not me.

127
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:38,280
 >> They had this kind of con beef stuff that no one liked.

128
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:43,520
 And so a few people wanted to eat it that they ended up just using it to prop up things in the trenches.

129
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,840
 And they'll crates and crates of this stuff that normally eat.

130
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:51,440
 >> I think they would over indulge in the trenches if they were just using their food as opposed to.

131
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,480
 >> Not genuinely they did, because they liked something.

132
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,440
 >> It's not bad, was it?

133
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:57,840
 >> You think they were over indulged in the trenches?

134
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:01,080
 >> [LAUGH] >> Just replay that.

135
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:02,960
 >> How have I much?

136
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:03,560
 >> I have much.

137
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:08,160
 >> You think that the rancid meat they were served, which they could only walk on.

138
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:11,000
 >> [LAUGH] >> Wow.

139
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,600
 >> They were a little bit spoiled.

140
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,720
 >> [LAUGH]

141
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:24,480
 >> So the thing about the actual slogan itself was that it was just a genius slogan in that it just created a whole lot of things.

142
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:30,800
 >> Yeah, it was just fantastic and I was looking into a few slogans and I read the most popular slogan.

143
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:34,840
 We've mentioned it slightly by saying if British people were around the world.

144
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:36,520
 >> Heinz makes beans or whatever.

145
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:37,520
 >> Beans means Heinz.

146
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:38,520
 >> Yeah.

147
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:42,400
 >> Yeah, supposedly the most successful of all the slogans.

148
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:47,160
 >> Do they know on what metric that's the most successful in terms of the most people who remember it or.

149
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:51,800
 >> Yeah, I don't know, I actually know it was just a poll to say which was your favorite and.

150
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:52,800
 >> But it's very good.

151
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,200
 >> Beans means Heinz.

152
00:06:54,200 --> 00:07:00,600
 >> This led me to a kind of little snoop into the world of slogans, which I just.

153
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:04,440
 I ended up looking at basically the last Brazil world cup.

154
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:07,240
 >> They all came in with country slogans, did you see the slogans?

155
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,040
 >> I don't remember.

156
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:11,560
 >> Each country had a brand new slogan that they brought with their country.

157
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:14,440
 >> Okay, so give us a country and we'll see if we can work out like that.

158
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:16,560
 >> Okay, origin Tina.

159
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,160
 Give us the Falcons back, you bastard.

160
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,800
 >> [LAUGH]

161
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,000
 >> Is that it?

162
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
 >> Catchy.

163
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,680
 >> No, it's a rather boring word for that.

164
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:28,840
 It's not just a team, we are a country.

165
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:31,600
 France, this is my favorite one actually, the French one.

166
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,720
 >> Total France.

167
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:39,080
 >> No, so it's impossible is not a French word, which I love, because it literally is.

168
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:40,900
 >> [LAUGH]

169
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:41,720
 >> That's amazing.

170
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:42,720
 >> Yeah.

171
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:48,480
 >> I think that that French line, impossible is not a French word, is it was originally an

172
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,760
 appolian quotation.

173
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:50,760
 >> Yeah.

174
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:51,760
 >> Okay.

175
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:53,200
 >> Just in case we get to that if I could.

176
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,200
 >> Yeah.

177
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,520
 >> He was also wrong.

178
00:07:55,520 --> 00:08:01,780
 >> Yeah, this, I really like this story is from an article, again, sort of interesting

179
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:06,940
 fact about Marmite, I'm quoting directly, in 2009, a Marmite obsessed thief targeted a

180
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:10,180
 petrol station and stole 18 jars over a month.

181
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:14,140
 Ultimately, the owners stopped stocking it to prevent him striking again.

182
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:16,460
 >> [LAUGH]

183
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:22,020
 >> I love that, you go into like Tesco's and there's nothing there, it's like, well, we've

184
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:24,420
 had no robberies for the last three years.

185
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:25,420
 >> [LAUGH]

186
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:28,340
 >> But that's what they said, I read that article and they were like, well, what's the point

187
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:29,340
 of us putting it on ourselves?

188
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:31,940
 If this guy's just going to nick them, there's no point.

189
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:33,580
 >> No, but it's such a capitulation.

190
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:34,580
 >> Yeah.

191
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:35,580
 >> To theft.

192
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:36,660
 >> It does feel like that guy's one.

193
00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:37,860
 >> [LAUGH]

194
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:39,340
 >> Should we move on?

195
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:40,460
 >> Yeah, let's move on.

196
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:41,860
 >> A bit of joint matters.

197
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:42,860
 >> Yeah.

198
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:43,860
 >> One more thing I read.

199
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:47,380
 Former Chelsea Footballer Nicholas Anelka is said to be scared by Marmite.

200
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:48,860
 >> [LAUGH]

201
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:49,860
 >> Why?

202
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:52,740
 >> I don't know, but he always goes to that petrol station these days.

203
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:53,740
 >> Yeah.

204
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:56,220
 [MUSIC]

205
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:58,300
 >> Okay, time for fact number two.

206
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:03,020
 My fact this week is that the Knights of the Round Table included Lancelot,

207
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:05,660
 Gawain, Galahad, and Gareth.

208
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:06,860
 >> [LAUGH]

209
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:08,900
 >> Gareth, the Knight.

210
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:10,060
 >> What was his job?

211
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:11,820
 >> He was just like a classic Knight.

212
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:12,900
 >> The weird thing though, I was looking.

213
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:14,100
 >> He's not one of the famous ones, isn't he?

214
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:15,580
 >> He's not, then I was looking into him.

215
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:20,020
 He's actually Arthur's nephew, which seems like autism in the workplace.

216
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:21,060
 Here we go.

217
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:23,340
 >> I can't believe there's a new seat at the table.

218
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:23,860
 >> Yeah.

219
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:26,180
 >> I think he was going to be one of the great knights who's finally made his way.

220
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:28,860
 >> [LAUGH] >> Because you know there were lesser tables?

221
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:29,360
 >> No.

222
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,620
 >> Really? >> Yeah, are there other shapes as well?

223
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:34,620
 >> I'm not sure, I thought there are oval tables, and then.

224
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:38,900
 >> It was kind of like a main hall where they had, I mean, it obviously never happened.

225
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:42,620
 But like, there's a novel that's come out talking about the lesser knights.

226
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:47,220
 And I didn't realize that the novel actually has a basis in what is closer to the actual mythology.

227
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:51,500
 There were lots of other tables where there were like older knights who were retired, and there were.

228
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:55,180
 >> So it's like at a wedding where you've got the head table, and then you've got a really

229
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:57,580
 crap one in the corner with tedious people.

230
00:09:57,580 --> 00:10:03,180
 >> Was there a trapezium table, with the knights of the trapezium table, or the rhombus?

231
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:06,380
 >> [LAUGH] >> Just some of my favorite shapes, I thought I mentioned.

232
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:09,940
 >> So they have round tables at Starbucks, apparently.

233
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:10,740
 >> Oh, yeah.

234
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:16,380
 >> And the reason for that is that people look less alone when seated alone at a round table.

235
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:18,180
 >> Really? >> Yeah.

236
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:20,700
 >> Yeah, that makes sense, because there's no obvious place for

237
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:24,980
 other people to go, or as a square table I suppose, you want other people on the extra edges.

238
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:25,980
 >> Yeah. >> So Gareth?

239
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:27,740
 >> Yeah, so he was the nephew.

240
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:29,020
 >> We don't know anything else about him.

241
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:29,820
 >> No, there's quite a lot.

242
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:31,420
 I mean, he's a big part of the story.

243
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:35,980
 Actually, it's a bit unfair to say that he's the nephew and make that sound as a bad thing,

244
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:39,860
 because actually quite a number of the other knights were nephews of Arthur as well.

245
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:43,460
 >> Just because everyone got in on special favors, doesn't mean it's any better than the Gareth.

246
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:44,780
 >> [LAUGH]

247
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:49,940
 >> The only thing I know about him is that his nickname was Beaumont, which is Beaumont as a French word.

248
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:54,740
 It's beautiful hands, which people teased him, saying, hey, pretty hands.

249
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:55,740
 >> Teased, Gareth.

250
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:56,740
 >> Yeah.

251
00:10:56,740 --> 00:11:01,500
 >> But that does imply that he's not getting his hands dirty by killing dragons and stuff.

252
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,100
 >> Yeah, it does, yeah, yeah.

253
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:04,900
 >> I think he was a kitchen assistant or something like that.

254
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:05,900
 >> He was, yeah.

255
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:06,900
 >> Is that right?

256
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:07,900
 >> Yeah.

257
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:09,420
 >> For a while when he was sort of undercover.

258
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:13,940
 That sort of period where a really rich famous person goes into the slums and sees what it's

259
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:14,940
 like to be a normal person.

260
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:19,020
 >> Well, he was undercover with his massive shield and massive sword, which I mean.

261
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:20,020
 >> Yes, exactly.

262
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:22,420
 >> Peter the Great went undercover all the time.

263
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:23,420
 >> Yeah.

264
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:24,420
 >> He loved doing it, yeah.

265
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:29,220
 >> He was about seven feet tall and clearly the Tsar of Russia, so it was very hard for

266
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:30,220
 him to do it.

267
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:33,740
 >> And he had a big group of people with him that didn't he, like, 30 people walking along

268
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:34,740
 with him and he's going, nope.

269
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:35,740
 I like not him.

270
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:36,740
 >> Right, yeah.

271
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:40,940
 >> But he went, he got a job in a shipbuilding yard and he would only answer to the name Peter

272
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:41,940
 the Shipbuilder.

273
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:46,140
 And he would bring him matters of state in the evenings after he finished building ships

274
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:47,140
 for the day.

275
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:48,140
 >> Wow.

276
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:50,380
 >> And then he would say, he would sign a few documents and things and then he'd, yeah,

277
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:55,420
 he's kind of got it wrong if he calls himself Peter, what ever he does.

278
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:56,420
 >> Yeah.

279
00:11:56,420 --> 00:11:57,420
 >> Old habits die hard, basically.

280
00:11:57,420 --> 00:11:58,420
 Yeah, you can help it.

281
00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:00,420
 >> But I think people like pretended to not recognise him, didn't they?

282
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:01,420
 >> Yeah.

283
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:02,420
 >> You make him feel like he was.

284
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:03,420
 Things are successful.

285
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:04,420
 >> Yeah.

286
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:09,100
 >> I guess it was easy to go undercover in the olden days, you know, pre-photography days.

287
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:14,060
 There was a rumor in down at the time, wasn't there, that the way Marie Antoinette was captured

288
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:16,460
 was because some recognised her from the coins.

289
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:17,460
 >> Really?

290
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:21,500
 >> And that's then reported to her to the authorities, and that's why her.

291
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:22,500
 >> Yeah.

292
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:23,500
 >> That's pretty funny idea.

293
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:28,580
 Someone looking at the coin and then looking back at the coin, going, wait, excuse me Madame,

294
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:30,500
 could you stand sideways for a minute?

295
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:31,500
 >> [LAUGH]

296
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:40,220
 >> Back two nights, what would you guys say at night tournaments in the Middle Ages?

297
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:41,220
 What was the main sport?

298
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:42,220
 >> Jasting.

299
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:43,220
 >> No, it wasn't.

300
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:45,220
 Jasting was always a side sport.

301
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:50,100
 The main sport was always the Malay, which was the big group fight where all the nights

302
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:51,860
 like galted towards each other had a group fight.

303
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:52,860
 >> Like a melee, like her.

304
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:54,540
 >> Yeah, so we get Malay from.

305
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:55,540
 >> That's how it's supposed to be.

306
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:57,740
 >> Jasting was always just a side of it.

307
00:12:57,740 --> 00:13:02,940
 >> So like a lot of rulers and people campaigned to get jousting band because they thought

308
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:08,300
 it was distracted from the main Malay, and they thought it wasn't a necessary part.

309
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:14,020
 And Count Philip of Flanders actually used to turn up with a whole retinue and decline

310
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:17,980
 to join the Malay, and so make sure everyone else got in the Malay.

311
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:20,460
 And then when he was jousting, he'd be able to win the joust because everyone was tired

312
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:23,820
 from the Malay, and so people wanted to ban the jousting.

313
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:26,700
 >> I think it's true that the only reason more people didn't get killed in the Malay was

314
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:28,500
 because the main aim was to capture other people.

315
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:29,500
 >> Oh, really?

316
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:32,700
 >> And then you would sell them their armour back to them because it's very embarrassing.

317
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:34,700
 They basically rent some of your armour from you.

318
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:35,700
 >> Yeah.

319
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:37,700
 >> Would they go in with a lance?

320
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:39,700
 >> I don't know.

321
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:40,700
 >> Lance a lot would.

322
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:41,700
 >> Okay.

323
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:43,940
 A lance a lot.

324
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:47,620
 There's a guy called George Lancelot, he's in the news quite recently.

325
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:51,500
 He's had 176 convictions for repeated swery outbursts.

326
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:52,500
 >> Swery outbursts.

327
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:59,980
 >> He's been arrested for abuse a few times, and he claims to suffer from personality disorder,

328
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:05,100
 which makes him swear and run whenever he is out in public and he's been drinking.

329
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:08,180
 And recently he was sent to prison for a short amount of time.

330
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:13,300
 Because he was led from the dock in extra crown carts, he shouted, "I get less for burglary,

331
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:14,300
 fuck off."

332
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:16,300
 >> In his defence?

333
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:17,300
 >> Yeah.

334
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:18,300
 I've been drinking.

335
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:25,100
 >> Have you guys heard of the game, King Arthur, or played, in fact?

336
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:26,100
 >> No.

337
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:31,100
 >> This was a game that sailors played in the 16th and 17th centuries.

338
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:35,220
 So you'd let one crew member to play King Arthur, and he'd be dressed up in ridiculous robes

339
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:39,180
 and apparently wear a wig made of rope, and then everyone else of the crew would have to

340
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:43,300
 be formally introduced to this King Arthur, and they'd have to tip a bucket of freezing

341
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:44,940
 cold water over his head.

342
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:46,660
 >> So it's like the ice bucket challenge.

343
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:47,660
 >> It's a bit like that.

344
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:50,820
 But if you, when you tipped it over his head, and obviously I guess his reaction was quite

345
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:54,460
 amusing, if you cracked a smile or a laugh, you had to swap places with him, and you had

346
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:56,300
 to pick up the King Arthur character.

347
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:57,300
 >> Wow.

348
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:58,300
 That's great.

349
00:14:58,300 --> 00:14:59,300
 >> You only shouted.

350
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:00,300
 He said, "Hail King Arthur."

351
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:01,300
 Tipped a bucket over his head.

352
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:02,300
 Have to keep a straight face.

353
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:07,740
 I nominate Long John Silver.

354
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:12,180
 >> So just back to the nights, very quickly, because I'm not of your country.

355
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:15,420
 I didn't really get enough bringing totally with it.

356
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:17,780
 Obviously you guys might have them guessing in school.

357
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:18,780
 Was it a big part?

358
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:19,780
 >> Bitnighted.

359
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:20,780
 >> No, no, no.

360
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:21,780
 Just King Arthur the whole mythology.

361
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:22,780
 >> Not really.

362
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:23,780
 >> Not really.

363
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:24,780
 >> It's not true.

364
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:25,780
 >> It's not true.

365
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:26,780
 >> Yeah.

366
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:27,780
 >> Okay.

367
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:28,780
 >> I've seen the sword in the Stone Disney film.

368
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:29,780
 >> Yes.

369
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:30,780
 >> I haven't.

370
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:31,780
 >> Oh, well, it's the best Disney film.

371
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:33,780
 It's a really hot squirrel, isn't it?

372
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:34,780
 >> That is true.

373
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:35,780
 >> True, right?

374
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:36,780
 >> It's pretty fit.

375
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:37,780
 >> She is sexy.

376
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:40,780
 >> Like the fox in Robin Hood, for example.

377
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:42,780
 That was Robin Hood.

378
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:43,780
 >> What?

379
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:44,780
 Oh, yeah, yeah.

380
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:45,780
 I'm sorry.

381
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:46,780
 >> He's a handsome fox.

382
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:48,780
 >> He's a handsome fox.

383
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:49,780
 >> Yeah.

384
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:52,780
 But so there's no basis of truth in it whatsoever, right?

385
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:53,780
 >> There are certainly claims.

386
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:59,420
 There's a claim that a huge round table that hangs in Winchester Hall is the real round

387
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:00,420
 table.

388
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:04,060
 So what happens is there's this mythology which most people think isn't true, but there

389
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:07,580
 might be some kind of historical basis to it, probably not.

390
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:11,380
 And so when you have anything like that, it means that everyone can claim part of it.

391
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:12,380
 So --

392
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:13,380
 >> Okay.

393
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:16,020
 >> I think the latest theory is that -- so it's a bit like Robin Hood, I think, is that

394
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:18,780
 people often come up with theories of where the Arthurian Legend might have come from.

395
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:20,620
 And the latest is that he was Kazekstani.

396
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:21,620
 >> Oh.

397
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:22,620
 >> Really?

398
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:23,620
 >> His mom interpretation.

399
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:24,620
 Kazekstani King.

400
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:27,620
 >> But he was a mythical Kazekstani King, as opposed to a mythical English King, is that

401
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:28,620
 right?

402
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:29,620
 >> I think so, yeah.

403
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:35,140
 The theory that he's Croatian, because his wife was called Igrain, and there is a town

404
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:39,180
 called Igrain in Croatia, and they've decided, well, it sounds the same so she must have been

405
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:40,180
 from here.

406
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:41,180
 >> Fair enough.

407
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:46,660
 >> So just with the round table and Gareth specifically, it turns out that Gareth's death

408
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:51,100
 is what led to the sort of breaking up of the round table of the night being their

409
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:52,100
 oldest vine.

410
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:53,100
 Yeah.

411
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:54,100
 >> So they really did care about the little kitchen.

412
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:55,100
 >> They loved Gareth.

413
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:56,100
 Yeah.

414
00:16:56,100 --> 00:17:01,420
 >> He wasn't just the nepotistic nephew coming in, he was very much loved.

415
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:05,540
 So Gareth, that was actually the first use of the name Gareth in recorded.

416
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:09,300
 >> Yeah, I read one theory that it was a mistake by Mallory.

417
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:10,300
 >> Oh.

418
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:16,300
 >> Okay, he was supposed to be called Gahariat, but he'd misheard Gahariat and said Gareth-

419
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:20,060
 >> I mean, it's not that much as Gareth and having the female name Hariat as the main

420
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:23,140
 part of your male name to be there.

421
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:27,220
 >> So do you think we could say that Gareth, in the same way that like Joe Anna is the female

422
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:30,740
 version of Joseph or whatever, Josephine, probably, do you think we could say that Gareth

423
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:32,260
 is the male version of Hariat?

424
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:37,980
 >> I could think of a better male equivalent of Hariat than Gareth.

425
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:38,980
 It's taken me a while.

426
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:39,980
 I don't know.

427
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:40,980
 [LAUGHTER]

428
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:42,980
 >> I don't know what you're talking about.

429
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:45,980
 It must be really obscure name.

430
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:53,260
 >> Let's move on to fact number three, and that is Andrew Hunter Murray.

431
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:59,220
 My fact is that the Ministry of Defence owns 15 gold courses, this is the British Ministry

432
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:00,220
 of Defence.

433
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:01,220
 >> Right.

434
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:02,220
 >> Yeah.

435
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:03,220
 >> Why do we know why?

436
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:04,220
 >> Why not?

437
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:09,620
 It's hard work killing the enemies of the crown as you can't relax and have a quick

438
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:10,620
 nine.

439
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:15,300
 >> I think it's because you know when you watch a James Bond movie, and I know Ministry

440
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:19,940
 of Defence is different MI6s, but they must have their spies as well, right, Ministry

441
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:20,940
 of Defence.

442
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:24,260
 Whenever you see James Bond movie, Bond is brilliant at everything.

443
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:26,660
 You don't become brilliant at everything without training like crazy.

444
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:27,660
 >> Good at golf.

445
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:28,660
 >> Yeah.

446
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:29,660
 >> Well, golf would be one of the things.

447
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:32,060
 There will be a Bond movie when he plays golf, and he just --

448
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:33,060
 >> He plays against a golf finger.

449
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:34,060
 >> Well, there you go.

450
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:38,500
 >> You assume down at the Ministry of Defence also owns loads of tennis courts and bowling

451
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:39,500
 alleys.

452
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:46,540
 >> I think I read that they do have like polo, poke tables, ski resorts, they've got a

453
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:53,300
 dart board, they've got a dart board, they've got one spy waiting for the evil villain who

454
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:57,340
 plays shoved hate me.

455
00:18:57,340 --> 00:19:02,860
 >> I want to see the inventory of everything that's red foot green.

456
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:15,220
 >> He's saying red foot green, red foot, red foot, red foot, red foot, red foot.

457
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:18,660
 >> Another thing the Ministry of Defence has is, this is in their list of achievements

458
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:25,540
 for 2014, completed a rollout of Internet Explorer 8 as its default browser.

459
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:29,540
 >> Not bad, that is.

460
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:34,220
 >> Still on Internet Explorer, not only that Internet Explorer 8 came out in 2009.

461
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:35,220
 >> Wow.

462
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:38,180
 >> Have you heard of Kabul Golf Club?

463
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:39,180
 >> No.

464
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:43,460
 >> This is the only golf club in the whole of Afghanistan.

465
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:44,460
 >> Right.

466
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:49,340
 >> And the course rules specifically call the Greens Browns, because it's very, very dry

467
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:50,340
 and there's no grass.

468
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:51,340
 >> Oh, really?

469
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:55,820
 >> It's all, basically, it's all sand, but they make the Greens more compact, don't they?

470
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:56,820
 >> Yeah.

471
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:57,820
 I think.

472
00:19:57,820 --> 00:20:01,140
 >> It used to be an area for training in the removal of mines.

473
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:05,860
 And you have to carry artificial turf with you sometimes, put that on the ground where

474
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:10,700
 your ball is, and play off that to the next bit, and then carry your artificial turf with

475
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:11,700
 you.

476
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:12,700
 >> That happens under the ball.

477
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:16,980
 >> That happens in actual, not like professional golf, but if you remember of a golf course,

478
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:22,060
 some golf courses in the UK, you'll carry some artificial turf really in the winter,

479
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:26,260
 because they don't want you hacking up the margin, you're on a bit of artificial stuff,

480
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:28,420
 put it down, put the ball on, and play it off that.

481
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:29,420
 >> That's fantastic.

482
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:30,420
 >> Yeah.

483
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:31,420
 >> I think that's really cool.

484
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:32,420
 >> Yeah.

485
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:34,420
 >> So what the first crazy golf course was?

486
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:35,420
 >> No.

487
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:39,980
 >> It was, it's still around, it's St Andrews, and it's a putting green, and it's got loads

488
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:43,780
 of real big hills on it, so the ball goes in all sorts of directions.

489
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:47,940
 And it was invented because ladies weren't allowed to play on the golf course, so they gave

490
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:51,860
 them this little fake golf course to play.

491
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:55,700
 And then it became so popular, because actually it's a lot more fun than proper golf.

492
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:56,700
 >> Yeah.

493
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:59,100
 >> If you're not good at golf, and that everyone starts to play in it.

494
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:01,020
 >> And then they kick the women off that one as well.

495
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:04,300
 >> No, no, no, no, you can play this tiny golf, you've just invented.

496
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:05,700
 >> For your fingers.

497
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:10,420
 >> A little cocktail stick for a golf club.

498
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:11,420
 >> That's so funny.

499
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:15,060
 >> It's true Mary Queen of Scots, first female golfer in records.

500
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:16,060
 >> Yeah, that is true.

501
00:21:16,060 --> 00:21:17,060
 >> Wow.

502
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:18,060
 >> Records, though, tricky things.

503
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:19,380
 But yeah, I think it is.

504
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:23,020
 And I think James IV of Scotland was the first recorded golf player.

505
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:25,260
 Again, he definitely wasn't the first ever golf player.

506
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:26,260
 But yeah.

507
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:27,980
 >> He played in 1502.

508
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:34,380
 He lifted the band that had previously been in place on playing golf because it was encouraged

509
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:35,780
 to encourage archery practice.

510
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:38,700
 Golf was not allowed, because you know, if you can't play golf, James, as you know.

511
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:40,780
 >> Yeah, his grandfather banned it, didn't he?

512
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:41,780
 >> Yeah.

513
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:42,780
 >> So.

514
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:44,740
 >> Probably part of the reason that he lifted the band was he realized that Cannon would

515
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:47,980
 probably replace archers in time, so it wasn't as important for everyone to be doing

516
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:48,980
 archery practice.

517
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:51,340
 It was a long-sighted, yeah.

518
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:56,620
 >> Quite a lot of famous people in history have been known for playing golf, haven't they?

519
00:21:56,620 --> 00:22:01,700
 Like I think Rugged Kipling was a big golf fan, and it's claimed that Rugged Kipling, I mean,

520
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:05,740
 it's true that Rugged Kipling invented snow golf, but it's often claimed like this is a

521
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:07,540
 sport that now we're all playing.

522
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:10,580
 And did you know that the Rugged Kipling invented it?

523
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:11,580
 >> I'm almost constant.

524
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:12,580
 He's getting a bit out of hand actually.

525
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:14,580
 I don't know how to snow golf, I play.

526
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:16,980
 >> Snow golf didn't do any archery anymore.

527
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:20,820
 >> Okay, so there was a golfer in Benine called Matthew Boyer.

528
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:25,340
 >> Okay, this might be a made-up story, but it's all obvious on it.

529
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:29,020
 One day he played a shot, described as a glorious slice.

530
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:34,260
 The ball hit a bird, which in turn dropped onto the windshield of a trainer jet.

531
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:40,460
 That trainer jet pilot then swerved out of the way and took out four new Mirage jets.

532
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:47,260
 And in one goal, totally demolished the entire air force of Benine through one golf shot.

533
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:48,260
 That's what happened.

534
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:49,660
 >> That is impressive.

535
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:54,260
 They worked out it would take him 145,000 years to pay off his debt.

536
00:22:54,260 --> 00:22:55,380
 >> Did he yell out in the court?

537
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:56,780
 I would have got less of a bergerory?

538
00:22:56,780 --> 00:22:57,620
 >> Fuck off.

539
00:22:57,620 --> 00:23:01,660
 >> I could be a cool catcher, it's relieving court every time.

540
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:07,900
 [MUSIC]

541
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:12,100
 >> Okay, time for our final fact, and that is Chazinski.

542
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:16,940
 >> My effect is that the rise in the use of female contraceptive pills is causing fish

543
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:19,300
 to become too effeminate.

544
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:20,780
 This is a genuine problem.

545
00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:26,380
 This is about how the lot of women use a female contraceptive pill, understandably, it's a great thing.

546
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:32,220
 But that does mean that we end up flushing out of our system, a lot of female hormones.

547
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:35,860
 That go into the drains and get into rivers, and the fish take them in.

548
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:41,700
 And it causes this thing called intersex, which means that like a male fish will stop producing sperm.

549
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:47,940
 It'll start producing eggs, and then it damages fish populations because it's thought they can't really breed as well when they stop doing that.

550
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:51,580
 So, yeah, bit of an issue, stuff being flushed down the drain.

551
00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:52,260
 >> Huge issue, yeah.

552
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:57,620
 >> How can there be that much that's going into the fish hanging out by the source of the sewer?

553
00:23:57,620 --> 00:24:01,420
 >> It's a good point, so yeah, it does take the tiniest amount to have an effect on them.

554
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:11,460
 So they added its EE2, which is ethanol estradiol, which is the main active ingredient of contraceptive pills, which triggers the condition in fish.

555
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:17,700
 And so they added five parts of that per trillion to water to test it out, and it still had an effect on the fish.

556
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:19,620
 >> Wow, that's extraordinary.

557
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:20,580
 >> That's right on out.

558
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:27,060
 >> So I was just other things that go through the drain systems and out in the ocean.

559
00:24:27,060 --> 00:24:33,660
 I was talking to this lady from the Natural History Museum, Sandy Napp, and she's actually, it's not relevant.

560
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:38,540
 She's a curator of potatoes and tomatoes, but what I'm talking about is facial products.

561
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:42,140
 She was telling me, she gave me this little vial of these little blue beads.

562
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:46,340
 And she was saying these beads are from, when you wash your face, with face washes.

563
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:48,580
 Those microbeads that they say they're inside the thing.

564
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:50,260
 And she was saying, what do you think these are made of?

565
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:54,020
 And I assumed it's a natural product, and she said no, it's a little bit of plastic.

566
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:59,220
 And the plastic is now apparently when it goes through the drains, that gets forced down to the ocean.

567
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:02,660
 It makes it through the system, fish are eating it, becoming toxic.

568
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:04,580
 It's actually poisoning the fish.

569
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:06,620
 And then when you eat the fish, it's actually harming us now.

570
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:08,980
 It's apparently it knocks up radiation levels or something.

571
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:09,780
 I don't, yeah.

572
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:11,580
 I've probably gone all pseudoe there at the end.

573
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:13,020
 >> And that's in moisturizer?

574
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:14,260
 >> It's in like a face wash.

575
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:18,900
 >> You know, if you buy, if you buy face wash, and it's kind of a bit rough.

576
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:23,220
 >> You know, and when you buy face wash, you know, when you wash your face.

577
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:24,100
 >> Never done that.

578
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:26,380
 Humans are paying for their vanity now, aren't they?

579
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:28,540
 >> You said that, like you weren't a human.

580
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:34,220
 >> New people will suffer puny morpals.

581
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:39,220
 >> So industrial pollutants are shrinking the genitals of polar bears in Greenland.

582
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:40,380
 >> That's their excuse.

583
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:44,060
 >> They should just inflate down the cold, shouldn't they?

584
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:50,580
 >> But apparently weakening their penis bones and industrial pollutants.

585
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:55,900
 >> Yeah, and also there's a chemical used to paint boats on the western coast of Australia

586
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:58,140
 called TBT.

587
00:25:58,140 --> 00:26:02,700
 And that causes female sea snails to grow male sex organs on the heads.

588
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:03,700
 >> Wow.

589
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:05,300
 >> That is pretty comfortable.

590
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:06,940
 >> That's an on mutation, yeah.

591
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:07,940
 >> Yeah.

592
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:08,940
 >> It's a funny one.

593
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:13,020
 >> The good news is that the percentage of snails with the penis on the foreheads is

594
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:19,500
 going down, and the size of the penis is shrinking thanks to a decreasing proportion of chemical

595
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:20,980
 in the water.

596
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:22,180
 >> That is good news.

597
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:27,940
 >> I think we all know what the most common insult is in the snail population there, isn't

598
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:28,940
 me?

599
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:31,940
 >> It's a pretty straightforward one.

600
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:38,860
 >> So another fish that would change sex is Nemo from the film Finding Nemo.

601
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:39,860
 >> Okay.

602
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:42,300
 >> Did you know about this clown fish?

603
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:49,420
 >> I mean, if the story went as a proper clown fish life cycle does, Nemo would hatch as

604
00:26:49,420 --> 00:26:52,900
 a hermaphrodite, because all clown fish are born in heraphrodites.

605
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:58,460
 And when the female mate dies, Nemo's father would have turned into a female.

606
00:26:58,460 --> 00:27:03,900
 Now, because Nemo is the only other clown fish around in this setting of the film, he would

607
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:09,220
 then become a male and mate with his now female father, unless his father dies, in which

608
00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:12,340
 case he changes into a female and goes off with another male.

609
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:15,260
 >> I haven't seen this movie, is that not what happens?

610
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:16,460
 >> That's pretty much it.

611
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:18,900
 >> He's an extended director, isn't he?

612
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:24,540
 >> I did read that the mother of Nemo dies after four minutes and three seconds of finding

613
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:25,540
 Nemo, right?

614
00:27:25,540 --> 00:27:26,540
 >> Yeah.

615
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:27,540
 >> Eat and buy a baracuda, apparently?

616
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:28,540
 >> Yep.

617
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:29,540
 >> But this was in a story.

618
00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:30,540
 >> Boy, don't relax.

619
00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:31,540
 Boy, don't relax.

620
00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:35,940
 >> Those who've only made it two minutes in.

621
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:40,920
 >> So this was in an article that says that two thirds of children's animated films contain

622
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:46,300
 an on-screen death of an important character, compared with only half of comparison films.

623
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:49,760
 So there are more deaths in children's films than there are in the other films.

624
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:55,300
 So basically it's either a dead parent, a single parent, or a mother who turns into a father

625
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:58,380
 who turns into a mother who has sex with a child.

626
00:27:58,380 --> 00:28:01,100
 It's usually one of those plot lives on the three classic.

627
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:05,180
 >> That is a fully functioning fish family, that you just described.

628
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:09,940
 So on finding Nemo, there's a book that's just come out I think, which is called Water,

629
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:13,620
 the Past, Present, and Future, which is quite interesting.

630
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:18,420
 And that states that one of the reasons that finding Nemo is set in Sydney is that Sydney

631
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:20,540
 is one of the only places in the world.

632
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:26,220
 So one of only three English-speaking places in the world where you could flush a fish down

633
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:32,180
 a drain, and it would make it to the sea without dying because the others are going to get

634
00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:36,260
 ground up and crush the death in various sewage treatment bars.

635
00:28:36,260 --> 00:28:40,380
 Yeah, in fact, there was panic when finding Nemo was released that kids were going to start

636
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:42,340
 doing this to their fish to free them.

637
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:46,100
 And so they released a statement saying actually a better title for this film would have been

638
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:50,940
 grinding Nemo because actually if you do this to a fish, it will end up crushed.

639
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:52,540
 >> Wait, who released that statement?

640
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:56,180
 >> It was the national pun or a trait for you to move them.

641
00:28:56,180 --> 00:28:57,180
 >> It was set.

642
00:28:57,180 --> 00:28:58,700
 >> It wasn't at all right, it's group.

643
00:28:58,700 --> 00:29:00,340
 >> No, it was someone involved with the film.

644
00:29:00,340 --> 00:29:01,340
 >> Oh, okay.

645
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:04,740
 >> It was helpful though, because children don't normally read a lot of statements.

646
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:07,780
 Well, I appreciate a good pun in the title of them.

647
00:29:07,780 --> 00:29:11,740
 So apparently there was a rise in parents calling plumbers going, how do I get my fish out?

648
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:13,740
 We've flushed it down, is it going to be saved?

649
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:14,740
 >> Really?

650
00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:15,740
 >> Yeah, yeah.

651
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:16,940
 Because children were just doing it.

652
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:20,220
 >> And there was, and also a lot of children, even though it doesn't exactly like hold up

653
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:25,500
 the virtues of owning a clownfish because he does just escape, there was a problem with

654
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:29,380
 kids suddenly wanting clownfish, and I think there was a certain sea that they were

655
00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:32,580
 just taken from where it was empty to build clownfish.

656
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:33,580
 >> Really?

657
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:34,580
 >> Yeah.

658
00:29:34,580 --> 00:29:35,580
 >> The damn selfish.

659
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:36,580
 >> I don't know.

660
00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:39,780
 >> No, that's actually the group of fish that clownfish are called damn selfish.

661
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:40,780
 It's not a cool name.

662
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:41,780
 >> The damn selfish.

663
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:42,780
 >> The damn selfish.

664
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:43,780
 >> Wait, damn.

665
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:44,780
 >> D-A-M selfish.

666
00:29:44,780 --> 00:29:45,780
 >> One word.

667
00:29:45,780 --> 00:29:46,780
 >> Oh, damn selfish.

668
00:29:46,780 --> 00:29:47,780
 >> I say it.

669
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:48,780
 >> [LAUGH]

670
00:29:48,780 --> 00:29:49,780
 [LAUGH]

671
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:50,780
 >> That's good.

672
00:29:50,780 --> 00:29:51,780
 >> Yeah, well done.

673
00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:58,820
 >> Quick question, why do people flush old fish down the toilet and not eat them?

674
00:29:58,820 --> 00:30:00,620
 >> [LAUGH]

675
00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:01,620
 >> That's the only two options.

676
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:06,420
 >> What, I just care for some reason that people bury their dogs and don't eat them?

677
00:30:06,420 --> 00:30:08,420
 >> Yeah, but we eat fish.

678
00:30:08,420 --> 00:30:09,420
 We don't eat dogs.

679
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:10,420
 >> Okay, good point.

680
00:30:10,420 --> 00:30:12,420
 >> There's fresh fish in the house now.

681
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:14,020
 >> There are so many reasons for James.

682
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:16,020
 >> Right, here's one good reason.

683
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:17,020
 >> Yeah.

684
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:19,220
 >> If your fish has just died, you don't know what it died of.

685
00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:21,020
 It could have died of a disease or something.

686
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:22,020
 >> Okay.

687
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:23,020
 >> So you won't want to eat it in that way.

688
00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:24,020
 >> Yeah, but that's one extreme.

689
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:27,620
 >> That's not the reason I didn't eat my hamster, for example.

690
00:30:27,620 --> 00:30:28,620
 >> Right.

691
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:32,020
 >> Also, I don't ask for a certificate of death when I'm in a restaurant.

692
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:33,020
 >> Well, it's a habit.

693
00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:36,620
 >> Okay, you don't understand, don't you, that the restaurants have asked for that?

694
00:30:36,620 --> 00:30:42,220
 At some point, the restaurants have to go through a process where they make sure their fish are healthy to eat.

695
00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:44,020
 >> It was kind of dead animals.

696
00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:45,620
 >> [LAUGH]

697
00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:47,620
 >> You've seen those big ads in the newspapers.

698
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:48,820
 We buy dead fish.

699
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:51,020
 [LAUGH]

700
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:52,420
 >> Cash for dead fish.

701
00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:54,220
 [LAUGH]

702
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:55,420
 >> Cash for the old fish.

703
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:59,620
 [LAUGH]

704
00:30:59,620 --> 00:31:02,220
 >> It just seems you're throwing away food.

705
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:10,620
 >> One story I like about finding Nemo is that when Andrew Stanton who had the big star had the idea and pitched it to the head of Pixar, John Lasseter.

706
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:16,220
 He did it in a session that lasted over an hour and he had lots of visual aids and character voices and it really tied him out.

707
00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:20,020
 He says, and at the end of it was like, oh, Lasseter, what do you think?

708
00:31:20,020 --> 00:31:22,020
 And Lasseter just went, you had me at fish.

709
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:25,220
 >> [LAUGH]

710
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:28,220
 >> Okay, so some stuff on contraceptives.

711
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:35,820
 Maybe sponges were used as contraceptives in the 1800s and 1900s.

712
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:38,420
 They would use them with spermicides.

713
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:41,620
 >> Okay, what I'm putting them into.

714
00:31:41,620 --> 00:31:49,420
 >> Yeah, so they would be used with things like quinine and olive oil and that would possibly be a contraceptive, yeah.

715
00:31:49,420 --> 00:31:52,620
 And some even doubled as household cleaners.

716
00:31:52,620 --> 00:32:00,020
 And one was advertised as a dual treatment for successful womanhood, which means contraception, and athletes foot.

717
00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:02,620
 >> [LAUGH] >> Two for one.

718
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:04,820
 >> I don't know which order you'd want to do that.

719
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:09,020
 >> I do, I say, now my athletes foot is clear up.

720
00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:11,420
 >> [LAUGH] >> But I have 20 children.

721
00:32:11,420 --> 00:32:14,220
 >> [LAUGH]

722
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:17,220
 >> Okay, that's it, that's all of our facts, thanks so much for listening.
