00:00:10,00:00:12,Hello and welcome to another episode.
00:00:12,00:00:15,"A nice such thing as a fish, a weekly podcast coming to you"
00:00:15,00:00:17,from the QI offices in Covern Garden.
00:00:17,00:00:18,My name is Dan Schreiber.
00:00:18,00:00:21,"I'm sitting here with Anichezinski, Andy Murray, and James"
00:00:21,00:00:22,Harkin.
00:00:22,00:00:24,"And once again, we have gathered around the microphones"
00:00:24,00:00:27,with our four favorite facts from the last seven days.
00:00:27,00:00:29,"And in no particular order, here we go."
00:00:29,00:00:30,[MUSIC]
00:00:30,00:00:34,"Starting with fact number one, and that is James."
00:00:34,00:00:37,">> Okay, my fact this week is that according to a 2011"
00:00:37,00:00:43,"Yugov survey, 27% of Britons neither love nor hate Marmite."
00:00:43,00:00:44,>> I love that.
00:00:44,00:00:45,>> That makes a lot of sense.
00:00:45,00:00:46,>> It is a great fact.
00:00:46,00:00:47,>> I really love it.
00:00:47,00:00:48,>> I think that's 27% I think.
00:00:48,00:00:49,>> I think I am too.
00:00:49,00:00:51,">> I love it, I love it."
00:00:51,00:00:52,>> Yeah.
00:00:52,00:00:53,>> But here's a weird one.
00:00:53,00:00:57,"I love Vegemite, but I hate Marmite when you take the comparison higher."
00:00:57,00:01:00,">> So you would obviously love Vegemite, because you're Australian."
00:01:00,00:01:02,But I actually prefer Vegemites of Marmite.
00:01:02,00:01:05,And I think I'm probably the only British person who would admit to that.
00:01:05,00:01:06,"It's just better, guys."
00:01:06,00:01:11,">> Well, I read an extraordinary story that IBM did a global survey of the most"
00:01:11,00:01:13,talked about brands online.
00:01:13,00:01:16,And they went through the internet scouring it for the most brands that were spoken about.
00:01:16,00:01:22,"And the top brand, higher than Coke, higher than Nike, was Vegemite."
00:01:22,00:01:23,>> Really?
00:01:23,00:01:25,>> More spoken about than any other brand.
00:01:25,00:01:28,You don't need to speak about Coke because it's always going to be like that.
00:01:28,00:01:29,">> Yeah, it could be that."
00:01:29,00:01:35,And the weird thing is that they tracked it down that 98% of Vegemite eaters are all Australian.
00:01:35,00:01:36,">> How many, what percent, are you?"
00:01:36,00:01:37,>> 98%.
00:01:37,00:01:38,">> Well, that sounds right."
00:01:38,00:01:40,">> Well, I don't think you can buy it anywhere else."
00:01:40,00:01:41,>> You can get it overseas now.
00:01:41,00:01:43,You can get it in the supermarkets here.
00:01:43,00:01:47,But so what's even more interesting is that it wasn't like they were tracking it to Australia.
00:01:47,00:01:48,They were tracking it globally.
00:01:48,00:01:51,So they know where all the Australians are around the world.
00:01:51,00:01:52,>> Wow.
00:01:52,00:01:54,>> Through Vegemite consumption.
00:01:54,00:01:56,">> Yeah, that's really great."
00:01:56,00:01:58,">> I mean, that's not obviously all the Australians."
00:01:58,00:02:02,"But it's like, it's just, it gives you a great map of how spread out Aussies are around the world."
00:02:02,00:02:04,>> You could probably do the same with British and baked beans.
00:02:04,00:02:06,">> Yes, yeah."
00:02:06,00:02:10,">> Although Vegemite is now really popular in certain Asian countries, like in Hong Kong,"
00:02:10,00:02:13,it's all sold out in Hong Kong from all supermarkets suddenly.
00:02:13,00:02:16,And that was when it was connected to umami flavor.
00:02:16,00:02:20,"So there was like a little press around it at some point, which said that is the umami flavor."
00:02:20,00:02:25,"Because that's, you know, hailed as a brilliant flavor in particularly in Japan and Hong Kong."
00:02:25,00:02:27,Suddenly it's incredibly popular.
00:02:27,00:02:27,>> Wow.
00:02:27,00:02:31,">> Right. Hey guys, are we talking about Vegemite on this podcast?"
00:02:31,00:02:32,Or are we talking about James' fact about mami?
00:02:32,00:02:38,">> My fact is about mami, so don't bring your Australian waves up in here."
00:02:38,00:02:40,>> I didn't know it's got celery in it.
00:02:40,00:02:40,>> That's it?
00:02:40,00:02:41,>> Yeah.
00:02:41,00:02:42,>> Mami is made with celery.
00:02:42,00:02:44,">> Wow, that must have been so good for you."
00:02:44,00:02:45,>> Yes.
00:02:45,00:02:45,>> Excellent.
00:02:45,00:02:48,">> It also has like the remnants of beer in it, doesn't it?"
00:02:48,00:02:52,"That's what it's made of, it's like the extract from the beer making."
00:02:52,00:02:55,">> Is it still, well, probably not anymore, but that's where it originally came from."
00:02:55,00:02:57,">> If you've got yeast left over, you may as well use it for a little while."
00:02:57,00:02:59,">> Yeah, I want to know, it's not drunk after breakfast."
00:02:59,00:03:03,>> That's because you have a serious problem in it.
00:03:03,00:03:04,It's because you're always drinking a breakfast.
00:03:04,00:03:06,I don't think it's the mami.
00:03:06,00:03:09,It gives the pine pine to wine if you're having good.
00:03:09,00:03:11,>> I don't blame the mami.
00:03:11,00:03:13,>> I think I must have had a bad slice of mami.
00:03:13,00:03:18,">> There was speaking of drinking, they released on Valentine's Day."
00:03:18,00:03:22,"In 2008, they released champagne flavored mami."
00:03:22,00:03:25,">> I don't remember that, and it had 3% champagne in it."
00:03:25,00:03:31,"Now, I would have thought that the mami would overpower the 3% of champagne."
00:03:31,00:03:33,>> Mami's a famously mild flavor.
00:03:33,00:03:36,">> Mami, do you know what it means?"
00:03:36,00:03:39,It means our mami is an old French cooking pot.
00:03:39,00:03:44,"So, you know the front of a mami jar, there is the little picture of a red and yellow."
00:03:44,00:03:45,">> Yeah, of a casserole dish."
00:03:45,00:03:46,">> Of a casserole dish, that is a mami."
00:03:46,00:03:51,">> Yeah, it's because it was originally made to add a little bit of extra to casseroles."
00:03:51,00:03:53,That was the point of mami in the first place.
00:03:53,00:03:53,">> Oh, really?"
00:03:53,00:03:55,">> Yeah, flavor."
00:03:55,00:03:58,">> Yeah, it's like a stock cube or something like that."
00:03:58,00:04:04,Because it was invented by the same guy who invented oxo cubes who was called Justus von Liebig.
00:04:04,00:04:12,And he was the first person who realized that you could take the yeast extracts and turn it into something you could eat.
00:04:12,00:04:15,But he is also known as the father of the fertilizer industry.
00:04:15,00:04:18,Because he discovered that nitrogen is essential for plants.
00:04:18,00:04:22,And he also developed a breast milk substitute for babies.
00:04:22,00:04:23,">> Wow, wow."
00:04:23,00:04:25,">> So, he taught this guy, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:04:25,00:04:30,">> So, hang on, archetype of the British mami was invented by, was he German?"
00:04:30,00:04:32,>> Justus von Liebig sounds German.
00:04:32,00:04:33,">> Yeah, I think he was actually."
00:04:33,00:04:39,"I think his main manufacturing place was in Freybentos, which is in Uruguay as well."
00:04:39,00:04:40,">> Yeah, why do you call it mami?"
00:04:40,00:04:44,"He should call it justice, so he could say justice will be served and breakfast."
00:04:44,00:04:49,>> Why do you want this mami thing to even?
00:04:49,00:04:52,">> So, was his breast milk substitute mami?"
00:04:52,00:04:53,>> That's what it was.
00:04:53,00:04:56,>> You just claim to have invented it.
00:04:56,00:04:58,">> I mean, invented a delicious ability."
00:04:58,00:04:59,>> It's a mami shot.
00:04:59,00:05:02,>> And a fantastic new hemorrhoid crepe.
00:05:02,00:05:05,>> Right.
00:05:05,00:05:11,">> There are a lot of articles I'd like about mami, because it's something that people like talking about."
00:05:11,00:05:15,"And I read this phrase, mami, one, two world wars."
00:05:15,00:05:17,"Okay, that's not strictly true."
00:05:17,00:05:22,It's the fastest climb down from the assertion of a fact I've ever read.
00:05:22,00:05:24,And that was on a BBC article about it.
00:05:24,00:05:27,>> But what they mean was it was in Soldiers Rations in the First World War.
00:05:27,00:05:28,>> Yeah.
00:05:28,00:05:33,>> Because you would get spammed condensed milk and mami basically didn't you?
00:05:33,00:05:34,>> That's not me.
00:05:34,00:05:38,>> They had this kind of con beef stuff that no one liked.
00:05:38,00:05:43,And so a few people wanted to eat it that they ended up just using it to prop up things in the trenches.
00:05:43,00:05:45,And they'll crates and crates of this stuff that normally eat.
00:05:45,00:05:51,>> I think they would over indulge in the trenches if they were just using their food as opposed to.
00:05:51,00:05:53,">> Not genuinely they did, because they liked something."
00:05:53,00:05:54,">> It's not bad, was it?"
00:05:54,00:05:57,>> You think they were over indulged in the trenches?
00:05:57,00:06:01,>> [LAUGH] >> Just replay that.
00:06:01,00:06:02,>> How have I much?
00:06:02,00:06:03,>> I have much.
00:06:03,00:06:08,">> You think that the rancid meat they were served, which they could only walk on."
00:06:08,00:06:11,>> [LAUGH] >> Wow.
00:06:11,00:06:12,>> They were a little bit spoiled.
00:06:12,00:06:14,>> [LAUGH]
00:06:14,00:06:24,>> So the thing about the actual slogan itself was that it was just a genius slogan in that it just created a whole lot of things.
00:06:24,00:06:30,">> Yeah, it was just fantastic and I was looking into a few slogans and I read the most popular slogan."
00:06:30,00:06:34,We've mentioned it slightly by saying if British people were around the world.
00:06:34,00:06:36,>> Heinz makes beans or whatever.
00:06:36,00:06:37,>> Beans means Heinz.
00:06:37,00:06:38,>> Yeah.
00:06:38,00:06:42,">> Yeah, supposedly the most successful of all the slogans."
00:06:42,00:06:47,>> Do they know on what metric that's the most successful in terms of the most people who remember it or.
00:06:47,00:06:51,">> Yeah, I don't know, I actually know it was just a poll to say which was your favorite and."
00:06:51,00:06:52,>> But it's very good.
00:06:52,00:06:54,>> Beans means Heinz.
00:06:54,00:07:00,">> This led me to a kind of little snoop into the world of slogans, which I just."
00:07:00,00:07:04,I ended up looking at basically the last Brazil world cup.
00:07:04,00:07:07,">> They all came in with country slogans, did you see the slogans?"
00:07:07,00:07:08,>> I don't remember.
00:07:08,00:07:11,>> Each country had a brand new slogan that they brought with their country.
00:07:11,00:07:14,">> Okay, so give us a country and we'll see if we can work out like that."
00:07:14,00:07:16,">> Okay, origin Tina."
00:07:16,00:07:18,"Give us the Falcons back, you bastard."
00:07:18,00:07:20,>> [LAUGH]
00:07:20,00:07:22,>> Is that it?
00:07:22,00:07:23,>> Catchy.
00:07:23,00:07:25,">> No, it's a rather boring word for that."
00:07:25,00:07:28,"It's not just a team, we are a country."
00:07:28,00:07:31,"France, this is my favorite one actually, the French one."
00:07:31,00:07:32,>> Total France.
00:07:32,00:07:39,">> No, so it's impossible is not a French word, which I love, because it literally is."
00:07:39,00:07:40,>> [LAUGH]
00:07:40,00:07:41,>> That's amazing.
00:07:41,00:07:42,>> Yeah.
00:07:42,00:07:48,">> I think that that French line, impossible is not a French word, is it was originally an"
00:07:48,00:07:49,appolian quotation.
00:07:49,00:07:50,>> Yeah.
00:07:50,00:07:51,>> Okay.
00:07:51,00:07:53,>> Just in case we get to that if I could.
00:07:53,00:07:54,>> Yeah.
00:07:54,00:07:55,>> He was also wrong.
00:07:55,00:08:01,">> Yeah, this, I really like this story is from an article, again, sort of interesting"
00:08:01,00:08:06,"fact about Marmite, I'm quoting directly, in 2009, a Marmite obsessed thief targeted a"
00:08:06,00:08:10,petrol station and stole 18 jars over a month.
00:08:10,00:08:14,"Ultimately, the owners stopped stocking it to prevent him striking again."
00:08:14,00:08:16,>> [LAUGH]
00:08:16,00:08:22,">> I love that, you go into like Tesco's and there's nothing there, it's like, well, we've"
00:08:22,00:08:24,had no robberies for the last three years.
00:08:24,00:08:25,>> [LAUGH]
00:08:25,00:08:28,">> But that's what they said, I read that article and they were like, well, what's the point"
00:08:28,00:08:29,of us putting it on ourselves?
00:08:29,00:08:31,"If this guy's just going to nick them, there's no point."
00:08:31,00:08:33,">> No, but it's such a capitulation."
00:08:33,00:08:34,>> Yeah.
00:08:34,00:08:35,>> To theft.
00:08:35,00:08:36,>> It does feel like that guy's one.
00:08:36,00:08:37,>> [LAUGH]
00:08:37,00:08:39,>> Should we move on?
00:08:39,00:08:40,">> Yeah, let's move on."
00:08:40,00:08:41,>> A bit of joint matters.
00:08:41,00:08:42,>> Yeah.
00:08:42,00:08:43,>> One more thing I read.
00:08:43,00:08:47,Former Chelsea Footballer Nicholas Anelka is said to be scared by Marmite.
00:08:47,00:08:48,>> [LAUGH]
00:08:48,00:08:49,>> Why?
00:08:49,00:08:52,">> I don't know, but he always goes to that petrol station these days."
00:08:52,00:08:53,>> Yeah.
00:08:53,00:08:56,[MUSIC]
00:08:56,00:08:58,">> Okay, time for fact number two."
00:08:58,00:09:03,"My fact this week is that the Knights of the Round Table included Lancelot,"
00:09:03,00:09:05,"Gawain, Galahad, and Gareth."
00:09:05,00:09:06,>> [LAUGH]
00:09:06,00:09:08,">> Gareth, the Knight."
00:09:08,00:09:10,>> What was his job?
00:09:10,00:09:11,>> He was just like a classic Knight.
00:09:11,00:09:12,">> The weird thing though, I was looking."
00:09:12,00:09:14,">> He's not one of the famous ones, isn't he?"
00:09:14,00:09:15,">> He's not, then I was looking into him."
00:09:15,00:09:20,"He's actually Arthur's nephew, which seems like autism in the workplace."
00:09:20,00:09:21,Here we go.
00:09:21,00:09:23,>> I can't believe there's a new seat at the table.
00:09:23,00:09:23,>> Yeah.
00:09:23,00:09:26,>> I think he was going to be one of the great knights who's finally made his way.
00:09:26,00:09:28,>> [LAUGH] >> Because you know there were lesser tables?
00:09:28,00:09:29,>> No.
00:09:29,00:09:31,">> Really? >> Yeah, are there other shapes as well?"
00:09:31,00:09:34,">> I'm not sure, I thought there are oval tables, and then."
00:09:34,00:09:38,">> It was kind of like a main hall where they had, I mean, it obviously never happened."
00:09:38,00:09:42,"But like, there's a novel that's come out talking about the lesser knights."
00:09:42,00:09:47,And I didn't realize that the novel actually has a basis in what is closer to the actual mythology.
00:09:47,00:09:51,"There were lots of other tables where there were like older knights who were retired, and there were."
00:09:51,00:09:55,">> So it's like at a wedding where you've got the head table, and then you've got a really"
00:09:55,00:09:57,crap one in the corner with tedious people.
00:09:57,00:10:03,">> Was there a trapezium table, with the knights of the trapezium table, or the rhombus?"
00:10:03,00:10:06,">> [LAUGH] >> Just some of my favorite shapes, I thought I mentioned."
00:10:06,00:10:09,">> So they have round tables at Starbucks, apparently."
00:10:09,00:10:10,">> Oh, yeah."
00:10:10,00:10:16,>> And the reason for that is that people look less alone when seated alone at a round table.
00:10:16,00:10:18,>> Really? >> Yeah.
00:10:18,00:10:20,">> Yeah, that makes sense, because there's no obvious place for"
00:10:20,00:10:24,"other people to go, or as a square table I suppose, you want other people on the extra edges."
00:10:24,00:10:25,>> Yeah. >> So Gareth?
00:10:25,00:10:27,">> Yeah, so he was the nephew."
00:10:27,00:10:29,>> We don't know anything else about him.
00:10:29,00:10:29,">> No, there's quite a lot."
00:10:29,00:10:31,"I mean, he's a big part of the story."
00:10:31,00:10:35,"Actually, it's a bit unfair to say that he's the nephew and make that sound as a bad thing,"
00:10:35,00:10:39,because actually quite a number of the other knights were nephews of Arthur as well.
00:10:39,00:10:43,">> Just because everyone got in on special favors, doesn't mean it's any better than the Gareth."
00:10:43,00:10:44,>> [LAUGH]
00:10:44,00:10:49,">> The only thing I know about him is that his nickname was Beaumont, which is Beaumont as a French word."
00:10:49,00:10:54,"It's beautiful hands, which people teased him, saying, hey, pretty hands."
00:10:54,00:10:55,">> Teased, Gareth."
00:10:55,00:10:56,>> Yeah.
00:10:56,00:11:01,>> But that does imply that he's not getting his hands dirty by killing dragons and stuff.
00:11:01,00:11:03,">> Yeah, it does, yeah, yeah."
00:11:03,00:11:04,>> I think he was a kitchen assistant or something like that.
00:11:04,00:11:05,">> He was, yeah."
00:11:05,00:11:06,>> Is that right?
00:11:06,00:11:07,>> Yeah.
00:11:07,00:11:09,>> For a while when he was sort of undercover.
00:11:09,00:11:13,That sort of period where a really rich famous person goes into the slums and sees what it's
00:11:13,00:11:14,like to be a normal person.
00:11:14,00:11:19,">> Well, he was undercover with his massive shield and massive sword, which I mean."
00:11:19,00:11:20,">> Yes, exactly."
00:11:20,00:11:22,>> Peter the Great went undercover all the time.
00:11:22,00:11:23,>> Yeah.
00:11:23,00:11:24,">> He loved doing it, yeah."
00:11:24,00:11:29,">> He was about seven feet tall and clearly the Tsar of Russia, so it was very hard for"
00:11:29,00:11:30,him to do it.
00:11:30,00:11:33,">> And he had a big group of people with him that didn't he, like, 30 people walking along"
00:11:33,00:11:34,"with him and he's going, nope."
00:11:34,00:11:35,I like not him.
00:11:35,00:11:36,">> Right, yeah."
00:11:36,00:11:40,">> But he went, he got a job in a shipbuilding yard and he would only answer to the name Peter"
00:11:40,00:11:41,the Shipbuilder.
00:11:41,00:11:46,And he would bring him matters of state in the evenings after he finished building ships
00:11:46,00:11:47,for the day.
00:11:47,00:11:48,>> Wow.
00:11:48,00:11:50,">> And then he would say, he would sign a few documents and things and then he'd, yeah,"
00:11:50,00:11:55,"he's kind of got it wrong if he calls himself Peter, what ever he does."
00:11:55,00:11:56,>> Yeah.
00:11:56,00:11:57,">> Old habits die hard, basically."
00:11:57,00:11:58,"Yeah, you can help it."
00:11:58,00:12:00,">> But I think people like pretended to not recognise him, didn't they?"
00:12:00,00:12:01,>> Yeah.
00:12:01,00:12:02,>> You make him feel like he was.
00:12:02,00:12:03,Things are successful.
00:12:03,00:12:04,>> Yeah.
00:12:04,00:12:09,">> I guess it was easy to go undercover in the olden days, you know, pre-photography days."
00:12:09,00:12:14,"There was a rumor in down at the time, wasn't there, that the way Marie Antoinette was captured"
00:12:14,00:12:16,was because some recognised her from the coins.
00:12:16,00:12:17,>> Really?
00:12:17,00:12:21,">> And that's then reported to her to the authorities, and that's why her."
00:12:21,00:12:22,>> Yeah.
00:12:22,00:12:23,>> That's pretty funny idea.
00:12:23,00:12:28,"Someone looking at the coin and then looking back at the coin, going, wait, excuse me Madame,"
00:12:28,00:12:30,could you stand sideways for a minute?
00:12:30,00:12:31,>> [LAUGH]
00:12:31,00:12:40,">> Back two nights, what would you guys say at night tournaments in the Middle Ages?"
00:12:40,00:12:41,What was the main sport?
00:12:41,00:12:42,>> Jasting.
00:12:42,00:12:43,">> No, it wasn't."
00:12:43,00:12:45,Jasting was always a side sport.
00:12:45,00:12:50,"The main sport was always the Malay, which was the big group fight where all the nights"
00:12:50,00:12:51,like galted towards each other had a group fight.
00:12:51,00:12:52,">> Like a melee, like her."
00:12:52,00:12:54,">> Yeah, so we get Malay from."
00:12:54,00:12:55,>> That's how it's supposed to be.
00:12:55,00:12:57,>> Jasting was always just a side of it.
00:12:57,00:13:02,>> So like a lot of rulers and people campaigned to get jousting band because they thought
00:13:02,00:13:08,"it was distracted from the main Malay, and they thought it wasn't a necessary part."
00:13:08,00:13:14,And Count Philip of Flanders actually used to turn up with a whole retinue and decline
00:13:14,00:13:17,"to join the Malay, and so make sure everyone else got in the Malay."
00:13:17,00:13:20,"And then when he was jousting, he'd be able to win the joust because everyone was tired"
00:13:20,00:13:23,"from the Malay, and so people wanted to ban the jousting."
00:13:23,00:13:26,>> I think it's true that the only reason more people didn't get killed in the Malay was
00:13:26,00:13:28,because the main aim was to capture other people.
00:13:28,00:13:29,">> Oh, really?"
00:13:29,00:13:32,>> And then you would sell them their armour back to them because it's very embarrassing.
00:13:32,00:13:34,They basically rent some of your armour from you.
00:13:34,00:13:35,>> Yeah.
00:13:35,00:13:37,>> Would they go in with a lance?
00:13:37,00:13:39,>> I don't know.
00:13:39,00:13:40,>> Lance a lot would.
00:13:40,00:13:41,>> Okay.
00:13:41,00:13:43,A lance a lot.
00:13:43,00:13:47,"There's a guy called George Lancelot, he's in the news quite recently."
00:13:47,00:13:51,He's had 176 convictions for repeated swery outbursts.
00:13:51,00:13:52,>> Swery outbursts.
00:13:52,00:13:59,">> He's been arrested for abuse a few times, and he claims to suffer from personality disorder,"
00:13:59,00:14:05,which makes him swear and run whenever he is out in public and he's been drinking.
00:14:05,00:14:08,And recently he was sent to prison for a short amount of time.
00:14:08,00:14:13,"Because he was led from the dock in extra crown carts, he shouted, ""I get less for burglary,"
00:14:13,00:14:14,"fuck off."""
00:14:14,00:14:16,>> In his defence?
00:14:16,00:14:17,>> Yeah.
00:14:17,00:14:18,I've been drinking.
00:14:18,00:14:25,">> Have you guys heard of the game, King Arthur, or played, in fact?"
00:14:25,00:14:26,>> No.
00:14:26,00:14:31,>> This was a game that sailors played in the 16th and 17th centuries.
00:14:31,00:14:35,"So you'd let one crew member to play King Arthur, and he'd be dressed up in ridiculous robes"
00:14:35,00:14:39,"and apparently wear a wig made of rope, and then everyone else of the crew would have to"
00:14:39,00:14:43,"be formally introduced to this King Arthur, and they'd have to tip a bucket of freezing"
00:14:43,00:14:44,cold water over his head.
00:14:44,00:14:46,>> So it's like the ice bucket challenge.
00:14:46,00:14:47,>> It's a bit like that.
00:14:47,00:14:50,"But if you, when you tipped it over his head, and obviously I guess his reaction was quite"
00:14:50,00:14:54,"amusing, if you cracked a smile or a laugh, you had to swap places with him, and you had"
00:14:54,00:14:56,to pick up the King Arthur character.
00:14:56,00:14:57,>> Wow.
00:14:57,00:14:58,That's great.
00:14:58,00:14:59,>> You only shouted.
00:14:59,00:15:00,"He said, ""Hail King Arthur."""
00:15:00,00:15:01,Tipped a bucket over his head.
00:15:01,00:15:02,Have to keep a straight face.
00:15:02,00:15:07,I nominate Long John Silver.
00:15:07,00:15:12,">> So just back to the nights, very quickly, because I'm not of your country."
00:15:12,00:15:15,I didn't really get enough bringing totally with it.
00:15:15,00:15:17,Obviously you guys might have them guessing in school.
00:15:17,00:15:18,Was it a big part?
00:15:18,00:15:19,>> Bitnighted.
00:15:19,00:15:20,">> No, no, no."
00:15:20,00:15:21,Just King Arthur the whole mythology.
00:15:21,00:15:22,>> Not really.
00:15:22,00:15:23,>> Not really.
00:15:23,00:15:24,>> It's not true.
00:15:24,00:15:25,>> It's not true.
00:15:25,00:15:26,>> Yeah.
00:15:26,00:15:27,>> Okay.
00:15:27,00:15:28,>> I've seen the sword in the Stone Disney film.
00:15:28,00:15:29,>> Yes.
00:15:29,00:15:30,>> I haven't.
00:15:30,00:15:31,">> Oh, well, it's the best Disney film."
00:15:31,00:15:33,"It's a really hot squirrel, isn't it?"
00:15:33,00:15:34,>> That is true.
00:15:34,00:15:35,">> True, right?"
00:15:35,00:15:36,>> It's pretty fit.
00:15:36,00:15:37,>> She is sexy.
00:15:37,00:15:40,">> Like the fox in Robin Hood, for example."
00:15:40,00:15:42,That was Robin Hood.
00:15:42,00:15:43,>> What?
00:15:43,00:15:44,"Oh, yeah, yeah."
00:15:44,00:15:45,I'm sorry.
00:15:45,00:15:46,>> He's a handsome fox.
00:15:46,00:15:48,>> He's a handsome fox.
00:15:48,00:15:49,>> Yeah.
00:15:49,00:15:52,"But so there's no basis of truth in it whatsoever, right?"
00:15:52,00:15:53,>> There are certainly claims.
00:15:53,00:15:59,There's a claim that a huge round table that hangs in Winchester Hall is the real round
00:15:59,00:16:00,table.
00:16:00,00:16:04,"So what happens is there's this mythology which most people think isn't true, but there"
00:16:04,00:16:07,"might be some kind of historical basis to it, probably not."
00:16:07,00:16:11,"And so when you have anything like that, it means that everyone can claim part of it."
00:16:11,00:16:12,So --
00:16:12,00:16:13,>> Okay.
00:16:13,00:16:16,">> I think the latest theory is that -- so it's a bit like Robin Hood, I think, is that"
00:16:16,00:16:18,people often come up with theories of where the Arthurian Legend might have come from.
00:16:18,00:16:20,And the latest is that he was Kazekstani.
00:16:20,00:16:21,>> Oh.
00:16:21,00:16:22,>> Really?
00:16:22,00:16:23,>> His mom interpretation.
00:16:23,00:16:24,Kazekstani King.
00:16:24,00:16:27,">> But he was a mythical Kazekstani King, as opposed to a mythical English King, is that"
00:16:27,00:16:28,right?
00:16:28,00:16:29,">> I think so, yeah."
00:16:29,00:16:35,"The theory that he's Croatian, because his wife was called Igrain, and there is a town"
00:16:35,00:16:39,"called Igrain in Croatia, and they've decided, well, it sounds the same so she must have been"
00:16:39,00:16:40,from here.
00:16:40,00:16:41,>> Fair enough.
00:16:41,00:16:46,">> So just with the round table and Gareth specifically, it turns out that Gareth's death"
00:16:46,00:16:51,is what led to the sort of breaking up of the round table of the night being their
00:16:51,00:16:52,oldest vine.
00:16:52,00:16:53,Yeah.
00:16:53,00:16:54,>> So they really did care about the little kitchen.
00:16:54,00:16:55,>> They loved Gareth.
00:16:55,00:16:56,Yeah.
00:16:56,00:17:01,">> He wasn't just the nepotistic nephew coming in, he was very much loved."
00:17:01,00:17:05,"So Gareth, that was actually the first use of the name Gareth in recorded."
00:17:05,00:17:09,">> Yeah, I read one theory that it was a mistake by Mallory."
00:17:09,00:17:10,>> Oh.
00:17:10,00:17:16,">> Okay, he was supposed to be called Gahariat, but he'd misheard Gahariat and said Gareth-"
00:17:16,00:17:20,">> I mean, it's not that much as Gareth and having the female name Hariat as the main"
00:17:20,00:17:23,part of your male name to be there.
00:17:23,00:17:27,">> So do you think we could say that Gareth, in the same way that like Joe Anna is the female"
00:17:27,00:17:30,"version of Joseph or whatever, Josephine, probably, do you think we could say that Gareth"
00:17:30,00:17:32,is the male version of Hariat?
00:17:32,00:17:37,>> I could think of a better male equivalent of Hariat than Gareth.
00:17:37,00:17:38,It's taken me a while.
00:17:38,00:17:39,I don't know.
00:17:39,00:17:40,[LAUGHTER]
00:17:40,00:17:42,>> I don't know what you're talking about.
00:17:42,00:17:45,It must be really obscure name.
00:17:45,00:17:53,">> Let's move on to fact number three, and that is Andrew Hunter Murray."
00:17:53,00:17:59,"My fact is that the Ministry of Defence owns 15 gold courses, this is the British Ministry"
00:17:59,00:18:00,of Defence.
00:18:00,00:18:01,>> Right.
00:18:01,00:18:02,>> Yeah.
00:18:02,00:18:03,>> Why do we know why?
00:18:03,00:18:04,>> Why not?
00:18:04,00:18:09,It's hard work killing the enemies of the crown as you can't relax and have a quick
00:18:09,00:18:10,nine.
00:18:10,00:18:15,">> I think it's because you know when you watch a James Bond movie, and I know Ministry"
00:18:15,00:18:19,"of Defence is different MI6s, but they must have their spies as well, right, Ministry"
00:18:19,00:18:20,of Defence.
00:18:20,00:18:24,"Whenever you see James Bond movie, Bond is brilliant at everything."
00:18:24,00:18:26,You don't become brilliant at everything without training like crazy.
00:18:26,00:18:27,>> Good at golf.
00:18:27,00:18:28,>> Yeah.
00:18:28,00:18:29,">> Well, golf would be one of the things."
00:18:29,00:18:32,"There will be a Bond movie when he plays golf, and he just --"
00:18:32,00:18:33,>> He plays against a golf finger.
00:18:33,00:18:34,">> Well, there you go."
00:18:34,00:18:38,>> You assume down at the Ministry of Defence also owns loads of tennis courts and bowling
00:18:38,00:18:39,alleys.
00:18:39,00:18:46,">> I think I read that they do have like polo, poke tables, ski resorts, they've got a"
00:18:46,00:18:53,"dart board, they've got a dart board, they've got one spy waiting for the evil villain who"
00:18:53,00:18:57,plays shoved hate me.
00:18:57,00:19:02,>> I want to see the inventory of everything that's red foot green.
00:19:02,00:19:15,">> He's saying red foot green, red foot, red foot, red foot, red foot, red foot."
00:19:15,00:19:18,">> Another thing the Ministry of Defence has is, this is in their list of achievements"
00:19:18,00:19:25,"for 2014, completed a rollout of Internet Explorer 8 as its default browser."
00:19:25,00:19:29,">> Not bad, that is."
00:19:29,00:19:34,">> Still on Internet Explorer, not only that Internet Explorer 8 came out in 2009."
00:19:34,00:19:35,>> Wow.
00:19:35,00:19:38,>> Have you heard of Kabul Golf Club?
00:19:38,00:19:39,>> No.
00:19:39,00:19:43,>> This is the only golf club in the whole of Afghanistan.
00:19:43,00:19:44,>> Right.
00:19:44,00:19:49,">> And the course rules specifically call the Greens Browns, because it's very, very dry"
00:19:49,00:19:50,and there's no grass.
00:19:50,00:19:51,">> Oh, really?"
00:19:51,00:19:55,">> It's all, basically, it's all sand, but they make the Greens more compact, don't they?"
00:19:55,00:19:56,>> Yeah.
00:19:56,00:19:57,I think.
00:19:57,00:20:01,>> It used to be an area for training in the removal of mines.
00:20:01,00:20:05,"And you have to carry artificial turf with you sometimes, put that on the ground where"
00:20:05,00:20:10,"your ball is, and play off that to the next bit, and then carry your artificial turf with"
00:20:10,00:20:11,you.
00:20:11,00:20:12,>> That happens under the ball.
00:20:12,00:20:16,">> That happens in actual, not like professional golf, but if you remember of a golf course,"
00:20:16,00:20:22,"some golf courses in the UK, you'll carry some artificial turf really in the winter,"
00:20:22,00:20:26,"because they don't want you hacking up the margin, you're on a bit of artificial stuff,"
00:20:26,00:20:28,"put it down, put the ball on, and play it off that."
00:20:28,00:20:29,>> That's fantastic.
00:20:29,00:20:30,>> Yeah.
00:20:30,00:20:31,>> I think that's really cool.
00:20:31,00:20:32,>> Yeah.
00:20:32,00:20:34,>> So what the first crazy golf course was?
00:20:34,00:20:35,>> No.
00:20:35,00:20:39,">> It was, it's still around, it's St Andrews, and it's a putting green, and it's got loads"
00:20:39,00:20:43,"of real big hills on it, so the ball goes in all sorts of directions."
00:20:43,00:20:47,"And it was invented because ladies weren't allowed to play on the golf course, so they gave"
00:20:47,00:20:51,them this little fake golf course to play.
00:20:51,00:20:55,"And then it became so popular, because actually it's a lot more fun than proper golf."
00:20:55,00:20:56,>> Yeah.
00:20:56,00:20:59,">> If you're not good at golf, and that everyone starts to play in it."
00:20:59,00:21:01,>> And then they kick the women off that one as well.
00:21:01,00:21:04,">> No, no, no, no, you can play this tiny golf, you've just invented."
00:21:04,00:21:05,>> For your fingers.
00:21:05,00:21:10,>> A little cocktail stick for a golf club.
00:21:10,00:21:11,>> That's so funny.
00:21:11,00:21:15,">> It's true Mary Queen of Scots, first female golfer in records."
00:21:15,00:21:16,">> Yeah, that is true."
00:21:16,00:21:17,>> Wow.
00:21:17,00:21:18,">> Records, though, tricky things."
00:21:18,00:21:19,"But yeah, I think it is."
00:21:19,00:21:23,And I think James IV of Scotland was the first recorded golf player.
00:21:23,00:21:25,"Again, he definitely wasn't the first ever golf player."
00:21:25,00:21:26,But yeah.
00:21:26,00:21:27,>> He played in 1502.
00:21:27,00:21:34,He lifted the band that had previously been in place on playing golf because it was encouraged
00:21:34,00:21:35,to encourage archery practice.
00:21:35,00:21:38,"Golf was not allowed, because you know, if you can't play golf, James, as you know."
00:21:38,00:21:40,">> Yeah, his grandfather banned it, didn't he?"
00:21:40,00:21:41,>> Yeah.
00:21:41,00:21:42,>> So.
00:21:42,00:21:44,>> Probably part of the reason that he lifted the band was he realized that Cannon would
00:21:44,00:21:47,"probably replace archers in time, so it wasn't as important for everyone to be doing"
00:21:47,00:21:48,archery practice.
00:21:48,00:21:51,"It was a long-sighted, yeah."
00:21:51,00:21:56,">> Quite a lot of famous people in history have been known for playing golf, haven't they?"
00:21:56,00:22:01,"Like I think Rugged Kipling was a big golf fan, and it's claimed that Rugged Kipling, I mean,"
00:22:01,00:22:05,"it's true that Rugged Kipling invented snow golf, but it's often claimed like this is a"
00:22:05,00:22:07,sport that now we're all playing.
00:22:07,00:22:10,And did you know that the Rugged Kipling invented it?
00:22:10,00:22:11,>> I'm almost constant.
00:22:11,00:22:12,He's getting a bit out of hand actually.
00:22:12,00:22:14,"I don't know how to snow golf, I play."
00:22:14,00:22:16,>> Snow golf didn't do any archery anymore.
00:22:16,00:22:20,">> Okay, so there was a golfer in Benine called Matthew Boyer."
00:22:20,00:22:25,">> Okay, this might be a made-up story, but it's all obvious on it."
00:22:25,00:22:29,"One day he played a shot, described as a glorious slice."
00:22:29,00:22:34,"The ball hit a bird, which in turn dropped onto the windshield of a trainer jet."
00:22:34,00:22:40,That trainer jet pilot then swerved out of the way and took out four new Mirage jets.
00:22:40,00:22:47,"And in one goal, totally demolished the entire air force of Benine through one golf shot."
00:22:47,00:22:48,That's what happened.
00:22:48,00:22:49,>> That is impressive.
00:22:49,00:22:54,"They worked out it would take him 145,000 years to pay off his debt."
00:22:54,00:22:55,>> Did he yell out in the court?
00:22:55,00:22:56,I would have got less of a bergerory?
00:22:56,00:22:57,>> Fuck off.
00:22:57,00:23:01,">> I could be a cool catcher, it's relieving court every time."
00:23:01,00:23:07,[MUSIC]
00:23:07,00:23:12,">> Okay, time for our final fact, and that is Chazinski."
00:23:12,00:23:16,>> My effect is that the rise in the use of female contraceptive pills is causing fish
00:23:16,00:23:19,to become too effeminate.
00:23:19,00:23:20,This is a genuine problem.
00:23:20,00:23:26,"This is about how the lot of women use a female contraceptive pill, understandably, it's a great thing."
00:23:26,00:23:32,"But that does mean that we end up flushing out of our system, a lot of female hormones."
00:23:32,00:23:35,"That go into the drains and get into rivers, and the fish take them in."
00:23:35,00:23:41,"And it causes this thing called intersex, which means that like a male fish will stop producing sperm."
00:23:41,00:23:47,"It'll start producing eggs, and then it damages fish populations because it's thought they can't really breed as well when they stop doing that."
00:23:47,00:23:51,"So, yeah, bit of an issue, stuff being flushed down the drain."
00:23:51,00:23:52,">> Huge issue, yeah."
00:23:52,00:23:57,>> How can there be that much that's going into the fish hanging out by the source of the sewer?
00:23:57,00:24:01,">> It's a good point, so yeah, it does take the tiniest amount to have an effect on them."
00:24:01,00:24:11,"So they added its EE2, which is ethanol estradiol, which is the main active ingredient of contraceptive pills, which triggers the condition in fish."
00:24:11,00:24:17,"And so they added five parts of that per trillion to water to test it out, and it still had an effect on the fish."
00:24:17,00:24:19,">> Wow, that's extraordinary."
00:24:19,00:24:20,>> That's right on out.
00:24:20,00:24:27,>> So I was just other things that go through the drain systems and out in the ocean.
00:24:27,00:24:33,"I was talking to this lady from the Natural History Museum, Sandy Napp, and she's actually, it's not relevant."
00:24:33,00:24:38,"She's a curator of potatoes and tomatoes, but what I'm talking about is facial products."
00:24:38,00:24:42,"She was telling me, she gave me this little vial of these little blue beads."
00:24:42,00:24:46,"And she was saying these beads are from, when you wash your face, with face washes."
00:24:46,00:24:48,Those microbeads that they say they're inside the thing.
00:24:48,00:24:50,"And she was saying, what do you think these are made of?"
00:24:50,00:24:54,"And I assumed it's a natural product, and she said no, it's a little bit of plastic."
00:24:54,00:24:59,"And the plastic is now apparently when it goes through the drains, that gets forced down to the ocean."
00:24:59,00:25:02,"It makes it through the system, fish are eating it, becoming toxic."
00:25:02,00:25:04,It's actually poisoning the fish.
00:25:04,00:25:06,"And then when you eat the fish, it's actually harming us now."
00:25:06,00:25:08,It's apparently it knocks up radiation levels or something.
00:25:08,00:25:09,"I don't, yeah."
00:25:09,00:25:11,I've probably gone all pseudoe there at the end.
00:25:11,00:25:13,>> And that's in moisturizer?
00:25:13,00:25:14,>> It's in like a face wash.
00:25:14,00:25:18,">> You know, if you buy, if you buy face wash, and it's kind of a bit rough."
00:25:18,00:25:23,">> You know, and when you buy face wash, you know, when you wash your face."
00:25:23,00:25:24,>> Never done that.
00:25:24,00:25:26,"Humans are paying for their vanity now, aren't they?"
00:25:26,00:25:28,">> You said that, like you weren't a human."
00:25:28,00:25:34,>> New people will suffer puny morpals.
00:25:34,00:25:39,>> So industrial pollutants are shrinking the genitals of polar bears in Greenland.
00:25:39,00:25:40,>> That's their excuse.
00:25:40,00:25:44,">> They should just inflate down the cold, shouldn't they?"
00:25:44,00:25:50,>> But apparently weakening their penis bones and industrial pollutants.
00:25:50,00:25:55,">> Yeah, and also there's a chemical used to paint boats on the western coast of Australia"
00:25:55,00:25:58,called TBT.
00:25:58,00:26:02,And that causes female sea snails to grow male sex organs on the heads.
00:26:02,00:26:03,>> Wow.
00:26:03,00:26:05,>> That is pretty comfortable.
00:26:05,00:26:06,">> That's an on mutation, yeah."
00:26:06,00:26:07,>> Yeah.
00:26:07,00:26:08,>> It's a funny one.
00:26:08,00:26:13,>> The good news is that the percentage of snails with the penis on the foreheads is
00:26:13,00:26:19,"going down, and the size of the penis is shrinking thanks to a decreasing proportion of chemical"
00:26:19,00:26:20,in the water.
00:26:20,00:26:22,>> That is good news.
00:26:22,00:26:27,">> I think we all know what the most common insult is in the snail population there, isn't"
00:26:27,00:26:28,me?
00:26:28,00:26:31,>> It's a pretty straightforward one.
00:26:31,00:26:38,>> So another fish that would change sex is Nemo from the film Finding Nemo.
00:26:38,00:26:39,>> Okay.
00:26:39,00:26:42,>> Did you know about this clown fish?
00:26:42,00:26:49,">> I mean, if the story went as a proper clown fish life cycle does, Nemo would hatch as"
00:26:49,00:26:52,"a hermaphrodite, because all clown fish are born in heraphrodites."
00:26:52,00:26:58,"And when the female mate dies, Nemo's father would have turned into a female."
00:26:58,00:27:03,"Now, because Nemo is the only other clown fish around in this setting of the film, he would"
00:27:03,00:27:09,"then become a male and mate with his now female father, unless his father dies, in which"
00:27:09,00:27:12,case he changes into a female and goes off with another male.
00:27:12,00:27:15,">> I haven't seen this movie, is that not what happens?"
00:27:15,00:27:16,>> That's pretty much it.
00:27:16,00:27:18,">> He's an extended director, isn't he?"
00:27:18,00:27:24,>> I did read that the mother of Nemo dies after four minutes and three seconds of finding
00:27:24,00:27:25,"Nemo, right?"
00:27:25,00:27:26,>> Yeah.
00:27:26,00:27:27,">> Eat and buy a baracuda, apparently?"
00:27:27,00:27:28,>> Yep.
00:27:28,00:27:29,>> But this was in a story.
00:27:29,00:27:30,">> Boy, don't relax."
00:27:30,00:27:31,"Boy, don't relax."
00:27:31,00:27:35,>> Those who've only made it two minutes in.
00:27:35,00:27:40,>> So this was in an article that says that two thirds of children's animated films contain
00:27:40,00:27:46,"an on-screen death of an important character, compared with only half of comparison films."
00:27:46,00:27:49,So there are more deaths in children's films than there are in the other films.
00:27:49,00:27:55,"So basically it's either a dead parent, a single parent, or a mother who turns into a father"
00:27:55,00:27:58,who turns into a mother who has sex with a child.
00:27:58,00:28:01,It's usually one of those plot lives on the three classic.
00:28:01,00:28:05,">> That is a fully functioning fish family, that you just described."
00:28:05,00:28:09,"So on finding Nemo, there's a book that's just come out I think, which is called Water,"
00:28:09,00:28:13,"the Past, Present, and Future, which is quite interesting."
00:28:13,00:28:18,And that states that one of the reasons that finding Nemo is set in Sydney is that Sydney
00:28:18,00:28:20,is one of the only places in the world.
00:28:20,00:28:26,So one of only three English-speaking places in the world where you could flush a fish down
00:28:26,00:28:32,"a drain, and it would make it to the sea without dying because the others are going to get"
00:28:32,00:28:36,ground up and crush the death in various sewage treatment bars.
00:28:36,00:28:40,"Yeah, in fact, there was panic when finding Nemo was released that kids were going to start"
00:28:40,00:28:42,doing this to their fish to free them.
00:28:42,00:28:46,And so they released a statement saying actually a better title for this film would have been
00:28:46,00:28:50,"grinding Nemo because actually if you do this to a fish, it will end up crushed."
00:28:50,00:28:52,">> Wait, who released that statement?"
00:28:52,00:28:56,>> It was the national pun or a trait for you to move them.
00:28:56,00:28:57,>> It was set.
00:28:57,00:28:58,">> It wasn't at all right, it's group."
00:28:58,00:29:00,">> No, it was someone involved with the film."
00:29:00,00:29:01,">> Oh, okay."
00:29:01,00:29:04,">> It was helpful though, because children don't normally read a lot of statements."
00:29:04,00:29:07,"Well, I appreciate a good pun in the title of them."
00:29:07,00:29:11,"So apparently there was a rise in parents calling plumbers going, how do I get my fish out?"
00:29:11,00:29:13,"We've flushed it down, is it going to be saved?"
00:29:13,00:29:14,>> Really?
00:29:14,00:29:15,">> Yeah, yeah."
00:29:15,00:29:16,Because children were just doing it.
00:29:16,00:29:20,">> And there was, and also a lot of children, even though it doesn't exactly like hold up"
00:29:20,00:29:25,"the virtues of owning a clownfish because he does just escape, there was a problem with"
00:29:25,00:29:29,"kids suddenly wanting clownfish, and I think there was a certain sea that they were"
00:29:29,00:29:32,just taken from where it was empty to build clownfish.
00:29:32,00:29:33,>> Really?
00:29:33,00:29:34,>> Yeah.
00:29:34,00:29:35,>> The damn selfish.
00:29:35,00:29:36,>> I don't know.
00:29:36,00:29:39,">> No, that's actually the group of fish that clownfish are called damn selfish."
00:29:39,00:29:40,It's not a cool name.
00:29:40,00:29:41,>> The damn selfish.
00:29:41,00:29:42,>> The damn selfish.
00:29:42,00:29:43,">> Wait, damn."
00:29:43,00:29:44,>> D-A-M selfish.
00:29:44,00:29:45,>> One word.
00:29:45,00:29:46,">> Oh, damn selfish."
00:29:46,00:29:47,>> I say it.
00:29:47,00:29:48,>> [LAUGH]
00:29:48,00:29:49,[LAUGH]
00:29:49,00:29:50,>> That's good.
00:29:50,00:29:51,">> Yeah, well done."
00:29:51,00:29:58,">> Quick question, why do people flush old fish down the toilet and not eat them?"
00:29:58,00:30:00,>> [LAUGH]
00:30:00,00:30:01,>> That's the only two options.
00:30:01,00:30:06,">> What, I just care for some reason that people bury their dogs and don't eat them?"
00:30:06,00:30:08,">> Yeah, but we eat fish."
00:30:08,00:30:09,We don't eat dogs.
00:30:09,00:30:10,">> Okay, good point."
00:30:10,00:30:12,>> There's fresh fish in the house now.
00:30:12,00:30:14,>> There are so many reasons for James.
00:30:14,00:30:16,">> Right, here's one good reason."
00:30:16,00:30:17,>> Yeah.
00:30:17,00:30:19,">> If your fish has just died, you don't know what it died of."
00:30:19,00:30:21,It could have died of a disease or something.
00:30:21,00:30:22,>> Okay.
00:30:22,00:30:23,>> So you won't want to eat it in that way.
00:30:23,00:30:24,">> Yeah, but that's one extreme."
00:30:24,00:30:27,">> That's not the reason I didn't eat my hamster, for example."
00:30:27,00:30:28,>> Right.
00:30:28,00:30:32,">> Also, I don't ask for a certificate of death when I'm in a restaurant."
00:30:32,00:30:33,">> Well, it's a habit."
00:30:33,00:30:36,">> Okay, you don't understand, don't you, that the restaurants have asked for that?"
00:30:36,00:30:42,"At some point, the restaurants have to go through a process where they make sure their fish are healthy to eat."
00:30:42,00:30:44,>> It was kind of dead animals.
00:30:44,00:30:45,>> [LAUGH]
00:30:45,00:30:47,>> You've seen those big ads in the newspapers.
00:30:47,00:30:48,We buy dead fish.
00:30:48,00:30:51,[LAUGH]
00:30:51,00:30:52,>> Cash for dead fish.
00:30:52,00:30:54,[LAUGH]
00:30:54,00:30:55,>> Cash for the old fish.
00:30:55,00:30:59,[LAUGH]
00:30:59,00:31:02,>> It just seems you're throwing away food.
00:31:02,00:31:10,">> One story I like about finding Nemo is that when Andrew Stanton who had the big star had the idea and pitched it to the head of Pixar, John Lasseter."
00:31:10,00:31:16,He did it in a session that lasted over an hour and he had lots of visual aids and character voices and it really tied him out.
00:31:16,00:31:20,"He says, and at the end of it was like, oh, Lasseter, what do you think?"
00:31:20,00:31:22,"And Lasseter just went, you had me at fish."
00:31:22,00:31:25,>> [LAUGH]
00:31:25,00:31:28,">> Okay, so some stuff on contraceptives."
00:31:28,00:31:35,Maybe sponges were used as contraceptives in the 1800s and 1900s.
00:31:35,00:31:38,They would use them with spermicides.
00:31:38,00:31:41,">> Okay, what I'm putting them into."
00:31:41,00:31:49,">> Yeah, so they would be used with things like quinine and olive oil and that would possibly be a contraceptive, yeah."
00:31:49,00:31:52,And some even doubled as household cleaners.
00:31:52,00:32:00,"And one was advertised as a dual treatment for successful womanhood, which means contraception, and athletes foot."
00:32:00,00:32:02,>> [LAUGH] >> Two for one.
00:32:02,00:32:04,>> I don't know which order you'd want to do that.
00:32:04,00:32:09,">> I do, I say, now my athletes foot is clear up."
00:32:09,00:32:11,>> [LAUGH] >> But I have 20 children.
00:32:11,00:32:14,>> [LAUGH]
