00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.940
 Hey everyone, welcome to this week's episode of Fish.

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:04.420
 I just want to let you know that the episode

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:06.440
 you're about to listen to was recorded live

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:09.460
 at the London Podcast Festival at King's Place

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:12.800
 and that it was recorded just a few weeks ago.

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:15.120
 That's right, we actually managed to do a live gig

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:16.800
 in the year 2020.

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.240
 It was such a fun night.

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.200
 It was actually the first time that the four of us

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:21.200
 had been in a room together

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:22.960
 since this whole pandemic kicked off.

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:24.400
 It's about seven months.

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:25.680
 So that was incredibly fun.

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.880
 It was amazing to see some of the fish listeners

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:29.120
 sitting out there in the audience,

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:31.120
 all sitting there with their masks on,

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:32.880
 spread out around the auditorium

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.720
 so that we could make sure everyone was nicely,

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:36.760
 socially distanced from each other.

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:38.780
 And so big thank you to them.

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:40.420
 Big thank you to everyone who joined us online

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:41.920
 to watch it as it streamed.

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:44.640
 It was our first ever global gig as a result.

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.320
 And most importantly, a big thank you

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:47.600
 to the staff at King's Place

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.400
 who made sure everyone felt safe going ahead with this gig.

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:52.920
 So yeah, we hope you enjoy it.

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.480
 It's our first gig of the year,

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.480
 possibly our last, hopefully not.

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:00.360
 But here it is, live in London in the year 2020.

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:01.200
 Enjoy.

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:18.360
 Hello and welcome to another episode

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:19.760
 of No Such Thing as a Fish,

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:22.320
 a weekly podcast this week coming to you live

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.520
 from the London Podcast Festival.

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:27.520
 (audience cheering)

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:34.640
 My name is Dan Shriver.

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:37.000
 I'm sitting here with Anna Tachinsky,

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.360
 Andrew Hunter Murray and James Harkin.

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.520
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.240
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days.

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:47.440
 And in no particular order, here we go.

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:49.120
 Starting with my fact this week,

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:51.560
 my fact is that Theodore Roosevelt

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:54.800
 once was shot in the chest but survived

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:58.720
 thanks to a 50 page long speech tucked into his coat pocket.

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:01.080
 He delivered the speech reading from pages

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:04.080
 that now had two massive bullet holes in them.

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:06.360
 Wow.

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.760
 And he did a speech which lasted about 90 minutes.

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:10.600
 Wow.

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:12.960
 And that's where the idea of bullet points came from,

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:13.800
 isn't it?

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.560
 Come on, it's been seven months.

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:20.200
 (audience cheering)

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:21.880
 Yeah, this happened in 1912.

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:23.040
 He was in Milwaukee.

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.040
 He was on his way to the Milwaukee Auditorium

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.040
 and he was in an open top car.

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:28.720
 And as he was standing up to wave,

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:30.720
 a gunman who was called John Shrank

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.600
 shot him in the chest, basically at point blank range.

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:36.080
 And the bullet still went into his body

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:38.000
 and was lodged inside his body.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.400
 But rather than go to the hospital,

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.880
 he said, "I'll just quickly do my 90 minute speech."

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:44.440
 And you can actually see if you go online,

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:47.000
 they have in a museum the pages of this speech.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.360
 And when I say massive bullet holes,

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:51.160
 they are ginormous, these two ginormous bullet holes.

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:52.760
 But yeah, he was a badass like that.

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:54.600
 He was a badass, like, to make sure

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.360
 that it hadn't penetrated his lungs,

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:58.720
 he coughed into his hand three times

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:00.720
 and checked for blood to make sure

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.120
 that he didn't have to go to hospital.

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:03.640
 That's pretty hard car, isn't it?

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:06.280
 All of his aides were sort of standing around

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:07.640
 'cause they were quite nervous about this.

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:09.000
 They thought he should go to hospital.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.480
 Lots of the crowd, he announced right at the start,

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:13.280
 he said, "Friends, I should ask you to be

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:14.280
 "as quiet as possible.

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:15.920
 "I don't know whether you fully understand

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:17.560
 "that I have just been shot."

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:19.240
 And so people were standing around,

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:20.200
 it's sort of ready to catch him

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:21.240
 at the side of the stage, basically.

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:22.800
 And he kept glaring at them

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:25.000
 and he refused to even cut it short.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.760
 - Did he not have to miss out the odd word

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:28.640
 that the bullet holes had gone through?

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:29.720
 - Oh, yeah.

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:32.040
 - It actually didn't make any sense at all, the speech.

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:34.320
 - Yeah, it kind of came out as like a redacted speech

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:36.280
 that he wasn't giving us all the info on.

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:37.240
 - Did you guys see this?

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:39.120
 This allegedly happened when he announced,

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:40.920
 by the way, I've just been shot right at the top

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:43.320
 before he got into the actual stuff that was on his pages.

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:44.760
 Apparently, when he said that,

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:46.920
 someone in the crowd shouted, "Fake."

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:48.920
 (laughing)

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:52.160
 - Well, I didn't know Donald Trump was alive back then.

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:53.640
 - Supposedly, he stepped forward and said,

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:56.240
 "No, no, it's real, here's my beanie shirt."

00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:00.120
 - The guy had to come up and put his finger in the hole to me, too.

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:01.640
 - They left the bullet in, didn't they?

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:02.760
 Forever and ever, I think,

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:04.440
 'cause it was too dangerous to extract it,

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:06.480
 so just kept it in forever.

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:08.120
 But he sent a telegram to his wife,

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:09.600
 I think, straight after giving the speech,

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:10.880
 he dictated a telegram to her

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:12.800
 when he was on his way to hospital saying,

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:15.720
 "He was in excellent shape and he just had a little injury,

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:17.560
 "no more serious than one of the trivial injuries

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:19.320
 "that kids were always getting."

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:21.520
 (laughing)

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:25.720
 Their children were neglected is what I've read into that.

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:27.840
 It is one of those things that makes you understand

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:29.240
 why there are generations who say,

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:31.280
 "Oh, they don't make the might they used to."

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:34.960
 You can't imagine the, you know, us snowflakes standing there

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:36.440
 and delivering a 90-minute podcast

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:37.960
 with bullet holes through our chests.

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:41.240
 I wouldn't do it, I'm not gonna lie.

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:42.080
 - Yeah, it's very weird.

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:43.920
 I mean, what was interesting about him was,

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:46.640
 he was very much into physical exertion.

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:48.640
 He was in pushing his body all the time

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:49.880
 to sort of be the strongest he can be.

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:52.520
 There's accounts of him where he would hang a wire

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:54.920
 over a river and it would be a fast flowing,

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:56.480
 very dangerous river with currents

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:58.480
 and he would just hang on the rope

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:00.720
 just to bring his body strength better.

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:03.400
 But like the risk of if he'd fallen into the water

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:04.880
 would be possible drowning

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:06.920
 and he was just like always on the edge.

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:09.080
 - Well, do you know that's because he was brought up that way.

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:12.640
 His parents were something called muscular Christians.

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:13.480
 - What?

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:16.640
 That sounds so cool.

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:19.120
 - It sounds half-cool, doesn't it?

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:21.640
 - Oh, they worship at the church

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:24.280
 of our blessed lady of the six pack, don't they?

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:26.280
 Yeah, yeah, what is a muscular Christian?

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:28.560
 - It's pretty much exactly what it sounds like.

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:30.520
 So the idea was to be a good Christian.

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:32.320
 You had to kind of look after your body

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:33.760
 and be really muscular.

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:35.640
 It was quite, I wouldn't say misogynistic,

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:36.800
 but it was of its time.

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:38.920
 Like it was basically men should be strong

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:41.040
 and they should look after the women kind of thing.

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:43.920
 And it was quite popular in America at the time.

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:46.400
 And according to Wikipedia, I read this verbatim,

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:49.120
 it said muscular Christianity spread to other countries

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:50.600
 in the 19th century.

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:54.560
 It was well-entrenched in Australian society by 1860,

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:56.440
 though not always with much recognition

00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:57.800
 of the religious elements.

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:00.800
 (audience laughing)

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:03.320
 Simon, that explains quite a lot, doesn't it?

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:07.360
 - But he was quite a wimp initially, wasn't he, Teddy?

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:09.880
 In his childhood, he was, well, a wimp is harsh.

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:11.320
 He had asthma.

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:12.160
 So...

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:13.360
 (audience laughing)

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:15.360
 - That tells you a lot about Anna in the school yard,

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:16.200
 doesn't it?

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:17.160
 (audience laughing)

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:19.400
 - I had a very specific role in the playground.

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:21.200
 (audience laughing)

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:22.560
 No, he had a really difficult childhood.

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:24.280
 He had really bad asthma and he was,

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:26.880
 he described himself as quite sickly and quite weak.

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:28.600
 And he got beaten up as a teenager

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:30.040
 and found he couldn't defend himself.

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:32.960
 And so he demanded boxing lessons from his dad

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:35.320
 and got them and he devoted himself completely

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:37.560
 to becoming someone who was able to beat the bullies

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:38.720
 in the future. - Yeah.

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:39.720
 - And yeah, it was hardcore.

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:42.080
 There's lots of sources that say he was the first American

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:44.640
 to get a brown belt in Judo,

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:46.040
 which, like a lot of his biographies claim,

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:47.680
 he was certainly very good at Judo.

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:49.920
 - What's brown, definitely, is below black, right?

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:50.880
 - It's below black, yeah.

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:53.920
 - That's not, like, the greatest boast.

00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:55.960
 - It's the one below black, okay?

00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:58.040
 Just 'cause brown's a bit of a yucky color.

00:06:58.040 --> 00:06:59.720
 - No, it's just, but then black just has, like,

00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:01.200
 these extra, like, first and second down.

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:02.920
 Like, black goes on, it's fine.

00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:03.760
 We'll talk later.

00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:05.160
 - All right, Dan, you come back to me

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:06.680
 when you've got a black belt in Judo.

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:09.120
 - I have one in Taekwondo, I'll have you know.

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:11.080
 - Second Dan, yeah. - Oh, yeah, you do.

00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:12.400
 - That's great.

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:14.080
 - There were two Dan's in the class with that.

00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:17.080
 (audience laughing)

00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:20.640
 - He, I think as well,

00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:22.680
 I think he had mega anger issues as well,

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:25.000
 because he wouldn't let something go.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.720
 There was a story that happened in 1886.

00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:29.400
 We still have second Danning, is that what's going on?

00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:33.200
 - Sorry, I'm just laughing at my own joke over here.

00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:35.680
 (audience laughing)

00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:36.840
 - So good to see you again.

00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:38.800
 (audience laughing)

00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:42.840
 - Yeah, so 1886, Roosevelt, his boat was stolen

00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:45.080
 by these two thieves, and they took the boat

00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:46.640
 and they started riding it away.

00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:48.320
 And rather than letting it go, he was like,

00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:51.480
 "No, I'm gonna chase them, and I'm gonna get it back."

00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:53.200
 And he knew that they had such a head start

00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:55.040
 that this would take days.

00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:56.960
 So he was like, "Screw it, I'm doing it anyway."

00:07:56.960 --> 00:07:58.080
 So he decided to do it.

00:07:58.080 --> 00:07:59.520
 And this is how preparative he was.

00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:02.120
 He took food that he wanted to take in pursuit.

00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:04.760
 He also took a copy of Anna Karenina,

00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:05.600
 because he thought, "Oh."

00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:07.040
 - It's hard to protect him from the next bullet.

00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:09.960
 (audience laughing)

00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:11.640
 - Yeah, no, I think it was downtime

00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:13.360
 that he was like, "Just gonna bring a bullet."

00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:14.680
 - Anna Karenina, that's Tolstoy, isn't it?

00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:15.520
 - Yeah.

00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:17.360
 - Yeah, so he was effectively a cowboy

00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:19.840
 for some of his pre-presidency life.

00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:21.840
 And he, I think this may have been the same incident,

00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:23.760
 but he was chasing outlaws.

00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:25.920
 I don't know if he was kind of a deputy sheriff

00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:27.800
 or a deputy marshal, something like that.

00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:29.360
 He was chasing three outlaws at one point.

00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:30.280
 He caught them.

00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:32.520
 He then had to watch them for 40 hours

00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:34.320
 when he was sort of bringing them in.

00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:37.240
 And he kept himself awake by reading Tolstoy.

00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:38.080
 - Yeah, that was it.

00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:40.600
 He was reading and he was holding his shotgun

00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:42.400
 over the kind of bad guys.

00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:44.160
 He was reading like this. - No way.

00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:48.280
 - And he finished Anna Karenina halfway through the 40 hours

00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:49.960
 and he was like, "Well, what am I gonna do now?"

00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:51.400
 And one of the outlaws had a book

00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:52.520
 and he said, "Give me your book."

00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:53.840
 And he started reading his book.

00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:56.680
 - Oh, what's so funny?

00:08:56.680 --> 00:08:58.200
 Did he read it to them?

00:08:58.200 --> 00:08:59.040
 - I don't think so.

00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:01.160
 - Was it like Theodore Roosevelt's

00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:02.880
 lethal audio book time?

00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:03.720
 Or was it?

00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:06.040
 - Yeah, 'cause Anna Karenina loses her head at the end.

00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:07.920
 Maybe he was like, "This is what's gonna happen to you."

00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:09.280
 - Wow. - And spoiler.

00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:10.840
 - I cannot let you--

00:09:10.840 --> 00:09:12.560
 - If you haven't read Anna Karenina dead by then.

00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:14.840
 - She loses her head, either metaphorically or literally.

00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:18.400
 We won't specify which, but it involves a train.

00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:22.120
 - There is no one, there is no one listening to our podcast

00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:23.520
 that has not read Anna Karenina.

00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:24.720
 - I actually can't believe you just did that.

00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:26.800
 I think we've just lost all the online listeners

00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:28.840
 and some people at the back have walked out.

00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:30.640
 And also, I don't think she's not leaning over

00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:31.800
 to vomit on the railway.

00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:33.280
 The train doesn't knock her head off

00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:34.360
 as far as I remember.

00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:36.080
 It's just a full on death by train

00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:37.720
 if we are really revealing the ending.

00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:41.720
 - I think we've committed now, so yeah, go for it.

00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:42.560
 I think it's amazing.

00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:44.240
 It's a thing that's sort of not attached

00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:46.760
 to 19th century outlaw folktales

00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:49.280
 that there's always a sort of break to read a book

00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:50.600
 during a chase.

00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:51.440
 - Always carry a book.

00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:52.400
 - Everyone's got a book on them.

00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:53.360
 How cool is that?

00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:54.200
 - It's the outlaw code.

00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:56.280
 - Yeah, I just wonder what the outlaws book was.

00:09:56.280 --> 00:09:57.960
 'Cause it can't have been more Tolstoy.

00:09:57.960 --> 00:09:59.680
 What are the odds of them having--

00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:00.520
 - Unlikely.

00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:01.840
 - It's probably something really--

00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:02.920
 - How to steal a boat.

00:10:02.920 --> 00:10:09.080
 - He had cowboy practice actually when he was a kid.

00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:11.240
 His parents used to stick him on a horse

00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:12.800
 or in a carriage just behind a horse

00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:15.040
 and make the horse gallop at breakneck speed

00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:17.680
 as fast as it possibly could with his mouth open.

00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:19.440
 Not the horse, Teddy with his mouth open.

00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:21.720
 'Cause they thought that would cure his asthma.

00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:22.560
 - No.

00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:23.380
 - Really?

00:10:23.380 --> 00:10:25.080
 - It doesn't feel like that would work.

00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:25.920
 - Well.

00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:28.680
 - Look, have you tried it?

00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:30.240
 - I'm not a doctor.

00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:32.120
 - But didn't Thomas Jefferson tried to,

00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:34.480
 and I think thought he successfully cured his diarrhea

00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:36.200
 by horseback riding.

00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:38.400
 - That feels like that would cure your constipation

00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:39.480
 rather than your diarrhea.

00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:40.560
 - Yeah, you would think right.

00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:42.440
 Yeah, but maybe it floods it out.

00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:44.280
 - Yeah.

00:10:44.280 --> 00:10:46.680
 - But you put asthma sufferers on the carriage behind him

00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:48.120
 and that's two birds one stone.

00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:51.920
 - I just love all these old horse prescriptions.

00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:53.760
 Get on a horse and yeah.

00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:56.800
 - Theodore Roosevelt kind of invented piranhas.

00:10:56.800 --> 00:10:59.120
 - Wow.

00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:03.880
 - Interesting, he, and I stand by this, so.

00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:04.720
 - Wait, I know what's happened.

00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:06.560
 Andy, you've got my notes.

00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:07.400
 Sorry.

00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:09.480
 - No, he did, he genuinely did.

00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:11.720
 So he wrote a book, I think it was in about 1913.

00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:13.120
 So he'd already been president by this point

00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:14.160
 and he'd been shot and everything.

00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:16.160
 But he was, he did lots of expeditions

00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:17.560
 and big game hunting and all of this.

00:11:17.560 --> 00:11:19.960
 He wrote this book through the Brazilian wilderness

00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:22.120
 and in it he has this long bit describing

00:11:22.120 --> 00:11:24.720
 these ferocious piranhas that you get in the Amazon

00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:27.940
 and how they can strip a cow's flesh from its bones

00:11:27.940 --> 00:11:29.200
 in a few minutes.

00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:32.200
 And he said that they will snap a finger off a hand

00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:34.320
 in cautiously trailed in the water.

00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:36.060
 I never witnessed an exhibition

00:11:36.060 --> 00:11:38.640
 of such impotent savage fury.

00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:40.600
 So that's all, it's basically all thanks to him.

00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:43.240
 But the reason, I mean piranhas don't do that

00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:46.600
 unless they're really, unless it's really dry

00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:47.840
 and they're really crammed in together

00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:50.160
 and they're really, really hungry.

00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:51.720
 Some of them are vegetarian, for example.

00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:52.560
 But.

00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:53.640
 (audience laughs)

00:11:53.640 --> 00:11:55.400
 - The ethical piranhas.

00:11:55.400 --> 00:11:57.680
 There are more and more of them.

00:11:57.680 --> 00:11:59.740
 But they reckon that maybe, this is just a theory,

00:11:59.740 --> 00:12:01.040
 that when he was visiting the area

00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:03.040
 where he saw this kind of exhibition display

00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:05.480
 of piranha activity, it's because his hosts

00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:07.260
 had blocked off a bit of the river,

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:09.140
 chucked a load of piranhas in there,

00:12:09.140 --> 00:12:11.460
 let it dry out, not fed them at all.

00:12:11.460 --> 00:12:12.940
 And so by the time the Roosevelt arrived,

00:12:12.940 --> 00:12:14.900
 they were really, really, really ready to eat.

00:12:14.900 --> 00:12:16.500
 That's what made it like that.

00:12:16.500 --> 00:12:18.620
 - And are you saying he invented the piranha

00:12:18.620 --> 00:12:20.540
 because he sort of invented our idea

00:12:20.540 --> 00:12:22.060
 of the piranha as a very vicious animal?

00:12:22.060 --> 00:12:22.900
 - Yeah.

00:12:22.900 --> 00:12:23.740
 - That's fair.

00:12:23.740 --> 00:12:24.580
 - I see.

00:12:24.580 --> 00:12:25.920
 It's half fair, yeah.

00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:27.740
 (audience laughs)

00:12:27.740 --> 00:12:28.960
 He was a tough boss.

00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:30.140
 Given that he was a tough man,

00:12:30.140 --> 00:12:32.780
 he kind of expected the same from his cabinet, for instance.

00:12:32.780 --> 00:12:34.540
 He had this thing called the tennis cabinet,

00:12:34.540 --> 00:12:38.280
 which was initially started as a way of him exercising

00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:40.080
 with all his kind of younger employees.

00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:41.420
 And so his younger ministers would go out

00:12:41.420 --> 00:12:42.240
 and play tennis with him.

00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:43.900
 And he thought tennis actually was really dull

00:12:43.900 --> 00:12:46.420
 'cause he didn't really get to fight each other hand-to-hand.

00:12:46.420 --> 00:12:51.420
 And so, what the tennis cabinet became was, every day,

00:12:51.420 --> 00:12:54.740
 they had to get together and they picked a target on a map.

00:12:54.740 --> 00:12:56.600
 And without checking any of the terrain,

00:12:56.600 --> 00:12:59.560
 whether it was full of rivers or mountains or piranhas,

00:12:59.560 --> 00:13:02.280
 they had to just walk to that target without stopping

00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:04.240
 and without diverting from a straight course.

00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:05.680
 And so they ended up doing things like,

00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:07.360
 at one point, they were all made to swim

00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:09.120
 through a half-frozen river.

00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:11.040
 And, yeah, if you survive that.

00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:11.880
 - When he was president.

00:13:11.880 --> 00:13:12.720
 - Yeah. - Wow.

00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:14.080
 - Yeah, it's his cabinet.

00:13:14.080 --> 00:13:15.560
 Well, then he used to have these big boxing fights

00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:16.600
 in the White House, didn't he?

00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:18.880
 Where he invited professional boxers to come and fight him.

00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:20.120
 - Really? (audience laughs)

00:13:20.120 --> 00:13:21.680
 - Yeah.

00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:23.280
 You were asked to come and beat up the president.

00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:25.000
 - I imagine if the current president offered that

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.620
 in the White House. - I imagine the queue.

00:13:27.620 --> 00:13:30.620
 (audience laughs)

00:13:30.620 --> 00:13:32.060
 - We're gonna have to move on very shortly.

00:13:32.060 --> 00:13:34.860
 - Oh, well, we have to talk about the most hardcore member

00:13:34.860 --> 00:13:37.980
 of the Roosevelt family, which is his daughter, Alice.

00:13:37.980 --> 00:13:39.700
 She was amazing.

00:13:39.700 --> 00:13:42.420
 She basically was such a handful.

00:13:42.420 --> 00:13:44.340
 At one stage, Roosevelt said,

00:13:44.340 --> 00:13:46.340
 she kind of interrupted when he was doing something.

00:13:46.340 --> 00:13:48.140
 He said, "I can either run the country

00:13:48.140 --> 00:13:51.700
 "or I can attend to Alice, but I cannot possibly do both."

00:13:51.700 --> 00:13:53.220
 - Wow. - And she was,

00:13:53.220 --> 00:13:54.280
 totally hardcore.

00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:55.840
 - I mean, to be fair, it sounds like he was basically

00:13:55.840 --> 00:13:58.080
 running a fight club instead of being president.

00:13:58.080 --> 00:14:00.600
 (audience laughs)

00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:02.720
 - She was wild, 'cause he,

00:14:02.720 --> 00:14:04.160
 she had a bit of a traumatizing upbringing,

00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:06.680
 because so his wife and mother died on the same day,

00:14:06.680 --> 00:14:09.040
 and he was very upset about that, understandably.

00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:12.000
 And he refused to ever speak his wife's name again.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:13.840
 But awkwardly, his wife's name was Alice,

00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:15.560
 as was his daughter's.

00:14:15.560 --> 00:14:18.480
 And so he never, he refused to ever say his daughter's name.

00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:19.320
 - What?

00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:20.440
 - So she was a bit messed up about that,

00:14:20.440 --> 00:14:23.040
 and then they sort of made friends again a bit,

00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:25.180
 but she used to do crazy stuff.

00:14:25.180 --> 00:14:28.140
 Like she smoked publicly on the roof of the White House.

00:14:28.140 --> 00:14:29.480
 She played poker.

00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:31.420
 She partied all night.

00:14:31.420 --> 00:14:34.300
 She kept, so she carried bag around with her all the time,

00:14:34.300 --> 00:14:35.980
 in which she just kept a dagger,

00:14:35.980 --> 00:14:38.460
 her pet snake, who was called Emily Spinich,

00:14:38.460 --> 00:14:39.300
 (audience laughs)

00:14:39.300 --> 00:14:40.840
 and a copy of the Constitution.

00:14:40.840 --> 00:14:41.900
 (audience laughs)

00:14:41.900 --> 00:14:44.580
 - Sorry, the snake was called what?

00:14:44.580 --> 00:14:45.420
 - Oh, Emily Spinich.

00:14:45.420 --> 00:14:46.460
 - Emily Spinich, great.

00:14:46.460 --> 00:14:48.120
 And a copy of the Constitution.

00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:49.780
 - The Constitution, the US Constitution, yes.

00:14:49.780 --> 00:14:50.820
 - Was that a tip from her dad,

00:14:50.820 --> 00:14:52.460
 in case you go out and assassinate him?

00:14:52.460 --> 00:14:54.960
 - It was, yeah, fold it up, yeah.

00:14:54.960 --> 00:14:57.520
 - The reason that she smoked on top of the White House roof

00:14:57.520 --> 00:14:59.720
 was because he said he forbade her

00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:02.440
 from smoking cigarettes under my roof.

00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:04.440
 And so she's like, "Fuck it, I'll go on the roof then."

00:15:04.440 --> 00:15:05.280
 (audience laughs)

00:15:05.280 --> 00:15:07.600
 - Ah, what a dick, that's so wonderful.

00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:10.880
 - And then once Roosevelt left,

00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:12.720
 and the next guy came in who was Taft,

00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:15.080
 and then Woodrow Wilson afterwards,

00:15:15.080 --> 00:15:17.000
 she was banned from the White House, wasn't she?

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:18.520
 - Oh yeah, was that when she buried a voodoo doll

00:15:18.520 --> 00:15:20.400
 of someone under the, in the grounds?

00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:22.860
 - She buried a voodoo doll of Taft's wife

00:15:22.860 --> 00:15:24.940
 under the grounds before she left.

00:15:24.940 --> 00:15:27.380
 And then she made some kind of rybald joke

00:15:27.380 --> 00:15:30.260
 about Woodrow Wilson that no matter how much you Google,

00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:32.180
 you can never find this joke.

00:15:32.180 --> 00:15:34.300
 Believe me, that's how I spent the last five days

00:15:34.300 --> 00:15:35.300
 to find this joke.

00:15:35.300 --> 00:15:38.060
 But yeah, everyone hated her, who came after her,

00:15:38.060 --> 00:15:39.820
 and they wouldn't layer in the White House at all.

00:15:39.820 --> 00:15:41.380
 - Wow, the woman who made a joke

00:15:41.380 --> 00:15:43.140
 that's too rude for the internet.

00:15:43.140 --> 00:15:43.980
 - Yeah.

00:15:43.980 --> 00:15:46.560
 (upbeat music)

00:15:49.740 --> 00:15:51.680
 - We need to move on to our next fact.

00:15:51.680 --> 00:15:53.960
 Okay, it is time for fact number two,

00:15:53.960 --> 00:15:56.280
 and that is Andy.

00:15:56.280 --> 00:15:59.600
 - My fact is that some squirrels can put themselves

00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:01.680
 in a deep freeze for the winter,

00:16:01.680 --> 00:16:04.360
 then thaw themselves out to have a pee,

00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:06.220
 and then freeze themselves again.

00:16:06.220 --> 00:16:08.320
 (audience laughing)

00:16:08.320 --> 00:16:09.720
 Yeah, they're very cool.

00:16:09.720 --> 00:16:11.640
 - They have a piss break during hibernation.

00:16:11.640 --> 00:16:13.280
 - Well, seems to be, yeah.

00:16:13.280 --> 00:16:15.720
 So this is the Arctic ground squirrel,

00:16:15.720 --> 00:16:17.920
 and they are the most extreme hibernators on the planet.

00:16:17.920 --> 00:16:20.460
 They live so far north.

00:16:20.460 --> 00:16:23.620
 They hibernate for about 270 days of the year.

00:16:23.620 --> 00:16:24.460
 - Wow.

00:16:24.460 --> 00:16:25.280
 - Yeah.

00:16:25.280 --> 00:16:27.440
 - Imagine not leaving your house for 270 days.

00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:30.180
 (audience laughing)

00:16:30.180 --> 00:16:32.220
 - They don't even have Netflix, James.

00:16:32.220 --> 00:16:34.300
 They don't have anything.

00:16:34.300 --> 00:16:36.900
 So yeah, they slow down so much

00:16:36.900 --> 00:16:38.620
 that their hearts beat twice a minute

00:16:38.620 --> 00:16:40.980
 when they're in this sort of deep, deep chill state.

00:16:40.980 --> 00:16:43.540
 They can stop breathing for several minutes at a time

00:16:43.540 --> 00:16:44.940
 when they're in this state,

00:16:44.940 --> 00:16:46.380
 and most of their body gets down

00:16:46.380 --> 00:16:49.320
 to almost minus three degrees Celsius.

00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:50.720
 It's incredibly cold.

00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:51.720
 We don't know how they do it,

00:16:51.720 --> 00:16:53.000
 but they don't freeze,

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.480
 as in ice crystals don't form throughout them.

00:16:55.480 --> 00:16:58.760
 They have some way of stopping little ice crystals forming,

00:16:58.760 --> 00:17:00.400
 and so, 'cause that would kill them, obviously,

00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:01.360
 but they aren't that cold,

00:17:01.360 --> 00:17:03.080
 and they just look like little stones

00:17:03.080 --> 00:17:04.240
 on the ground, basically.

00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:05.920
 - Yeah, so if you've got a bottle of water

00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:08.920
 and you can kind of make it go really, really, really cold,

00:17:08.920 --> 00:17:11.600
 but then there's nothing for the ice to form around,

00:17:11.600 --> 00:17:12.840
 then it won't freeze.

00:17:12.840 --> 00:17:14.120
 And that's the same with these squirrels.

00:17:14.120 --> 00:17:15.560
 But what that means is,

00:17:15.560 --> 00:17:17.740
 if you pick up one of these squirrels that's hibernating

00:17:17.740 --> 00:17:19.460
 and shake it, it will die.

00:17:19.460 --> 00:17:22.460
 (audience laughing)

00:17:22.460 --> 00:17:25.880
 - So don't do that.

00:17:25.880 --> 00:17:27.620
 - Would it freeze at the same time?

00:17:27.620 --> 00:17:29.180
 - You would shake it, and then it would like--

00:17:29.180 --> 00:17:30.180
 - Smashing twice, wouldn't it?

00:17:30.180 --> 00:17:32.340
 - Yeah, yeah, it'd be like a frozen squirrel.

00:17:32.340 --> 00:17:34.340
 - And is that because shaking it,

00:17:34.340 --> 00:17:35.540
 you get a bit of debris in,

00:17:35.540 --> 00:17:37.500
 and as soon as you get a tiny particle into their body,

00:17:37.500 --> 00:17:39.180
 presumably it gets into their blood and it freezes it?

00:17:39.180 --> 00:17:40.940
 - Exactly, even just by shaking it,

00:17:40.940 --> 00:17:43.300
 a little bit of carbon dioxide inside the blood

00:17:43.300 --> 00:17:44.820
 might just come free,

00:17:44.820 --> 00:17:47.240
 and then that would, everything would nuclear around that.

00:17:47.240 --> 00:17:49.560
 - But they do have these periodic wake-ups, don't they?

00:17:49.560 --> 00:17:50.400
 - Yes.

00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:51.480
 - Where they sort of wean,

00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:53.240
 actually don't do much else, really.

00:17:53.240 --> 00:17:56.920
 In fact, I think, largely, they don't even urinate.

00:17:56.920 --> 00:17:59.560
 They just wake up in order to go to sleep.

00:17:59.560 --> 00:18:01.360
 (audience laughing)

00:18:01.360 --> 00:18:02.200
 - Which is amazing, right?

00:18:02.200 --> 00:18:03.040
 - Yeah.

00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:03.880
 - I always thought hibernation was sleep,

00:18:03.880 --> 00:18:06.200
 but no, it sounds snackering.

00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:07.840
 - Yeah, it's absolutely exhausting.

00:18:07.840 --> 00:18:10.480
 So they've got this store of fat between their shoulders,

00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:12.440
 which apparently acts as sort of thermostat.

00:18:12.440 --> 00:18:14.640
 It's the only bit of them that's staying functional

00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:16.980
 when they hibernate, and when they get a bit too cold,

00:18:16.980 --> 00:18:18.520
 they shiver themselves awake,

00:18:18.520 --> 00:18:21.100
 and if you watch a video of them, it is very sweet.

00:18:21.100 --> 00:18:23.060
 They're a little ball that starts shivering

00:18:23.060 --> 00:18:25.540
 until the little ball of fat pumps blood around,

00:18:25.540 --> 00:18:28.820
 and it's just so that they can wake up out of hibernation

00:18:28.820 --> 00:18:31.140
 in order to have eight hours good sleep,

00:18:31.140 --> 00:18:34.100
 and go into their REM cycles, have some dreams,

00:18:34.100 --> 00:18:36.900
 and then, otherwise, they get sleep-deprived in hibernation.

00:18:36.900 --> 00:18:38.300
 - I don't know if you guys read this,

00:18:38.300 --> 00:18:40.060
 'cause you said they had dreams.

00:18:40.060 --> 00:18:42.740
 I read one article, and it was from Brian Barnes,

00:18:42.740 --> 00:18:45.640
 who is the main guy on this subject,

00:18:45.640 --> 00:18:47.880
 and he said that they take a lot of magic mushrooms

00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:52.040
 just before hibernation, and nobody knows why they do it.

00:18:52.040 --> 00:18:53.920
 Well, they're trying to get as much fat as possible,

00:18:53.920 --> 00:18:55.760
 so they're trying to eat as much as possible,

00:18:55.760 --> 00:18:58.360
 but it just so happens that the thing that they eat

00:18:58.360 --> 00:19:00.680
 are these mushrooms, which are hallucinogenic,

00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:03.200
 and we don't know whether it gives them crazy dreams

00:19:03.200 --> 00:19:07.000
 for the 270 days, or whether the liver might be able

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:09.800
 to detoxify it or something, so we don't really know,

00:19:09.800 --> 00:19:12.280
 but it could be that for that whole 270 days,

00:19:12.280 --> 00:19:14.460
 they're just thinking of dogs with nine legs.

00:19:14.460 --> 00:19:17.100
 (audience laughing)

00:19:17.100 --> 00:19:18.460
 - That's so cool.

00:19:18.460 --> 00:19:21.500
 They're quite chemically altered in lots of ways,

00:19:21.500 --> 00:19:23.900
 'cause I don't know that, but the other thing they do

00:19:23.900 --> 00:19:27.060
 to survive is that they produce steroids in their body,

00:19:27.060 --> 00:19:29.380
 massive, massive levels of steroids

00:19:29.380 --> 00:19:31.540
 during the summer months when they're building up,

00:19:31.540 --> 00:19:34.420
 and they build their muscles by a third in size.

00:19:34.420 --> 00:19:36.620
 They increase by a third in just a few weeks,

00:19:36.620 --> 00:19:39.700
 and now, normally, that would lead to what we call

00:19:39.700 --> 00:19:44.700
 the thyroid rage, extra aggressive behavior, real fury.

00:19:44.700 --> 00:19:45.900
 - Tiny testicles.

00:19:45.900 --> 00:19:47.580
 - Tiny testicles.

00:19:47.580 --> 00:19:49.940
 - And a deep urge to spread Christianity, of course.

00:19:49.940 --> 00:19:52.940
 (audience laughing)

00:19:52.940 --> 00:19:58.740
 - But for some reason, they don't go into a rage,

00:19:58.740 --> 00:20:01.780
 so they can survive the testosterone coursing around them,

00:20:01.780 --> 00:20:05.500
 and the males have to stop when they do hibernate,

00:20:05.500 --> 00:20:06.880
 and then, this is a bit weird,

00:20:06.880 --> 00:20:08.460
 but their testicles shrink a lot,

00:20:08.460 --> 00:20:09.740
 so we see that.

00:20:09.740 --> 00:20:13.140
 But then, when they wake up, their testicles swell hugely,

00:20:13.140 --> 00:20:15.140
 and they get a massive extra rush of testosterone

00:20:15.140 --> 00:20:16.780
 when they wake up the next time round,

00:20:16.780 --> 00:20:18.980
 and they basically go through puberty again.

00:20:18.980 --> 00:20:20.860
 They basically do this every year.

00:20:20.860 --> 00:20:21.700
 - That's rough.

00:20:21.700 --> 00:20:22.540
 - Yeah.

00:20:22.540 --> 00:20:23.380
 - That is rough.

00:20:23.380 --> 00:20:24.940
 - And the males live way shorter than females do.

00:20:24.940 --> 00:20:27.220
 They live about six years, and when they wake up,

00:20:27.220 --> 00:20:29.660
 they do actually go into a sort of fighting frenzy

00:20:29.660 --> 00:20:31.340
 with other males, and then they have puberty,

00:20:31.340 --> 00:20:32.980
 and then they hope to mate, and then,

00:20:32.980 --> 00:20:34.180
 I think the reason they live shorter is

00:20:34.180 --> 00:20:36.420
 because they have to go through puberty six times

00:20:36.420 --> 00:20:38.340
 in their life, and it's too embarrassing.

00:20:38.340 --> 00:20:40.500
 (laughter)

00:20:40.500 --> 00:20:43.380
 - The voice drop it, where it's a bit wobbly, yeah.

00:20:43.380 --> 00:20:44.780
 - The acne again.

00:20:44.780 --> 00:20:46.100
 (laughter)

00:20:46.100 --> 00:20:48.700
 They all wake for longer than the females, though, aren't they?

00:20:48.700 --> 00:20:51.860
 They go to sleep a bit later than the ladies.

00:20:51.860 --> 00:20:54.220
 They sort of store food in a little cache,

00:20:54.220 --> 00:20:55.900
 whereas the ladies just fall asleep,

00:20:55.900 --> 00:20:59.140
 and they wake up earlier in order to kind of

00:20:59.140 --> 00:21:01.540
 start getting ready for mating,

00:21:01.540 --> 00:21:03.620
 and essentially, the females wake up

00:21:03.620 --> 00:21:05.460
 about three weeks after the males,

00:21:05.460 --> 00:21:09.740
 and their entire waking life is waking up

00:21:09.740 --> 00:21:11.260
 immediately being mated with,

00:21:11.260 --> 00:21:14.140
 within 12 hours of waking up by a male,

00:21:14.140 --> 00:21:16.900
 being pregnant, gestating for 25 days,

00:21:16.900 --> 00:21:19.940
 caring for the young for 10 weeks, going back to sleep.

00:21:19.940 --> 00:21:21.260
 That's their lives.

00:21:21.260 --> 00:21:23.340
 - They probably need a lot of sleep after all that, though,

00:21:23.340 --> 00:21:25.740
 don't they, fairness? - They do.

00:21:25.740 --> 00:21:27.820
 - They have very weird burrow systems,

00:21:27.820 --> 00:21:29.820
 or very clever burrow systems, actually,

00:21:29.820 --> 00:21:31.980
 so they have three different kinds of house.

00:21:31.980 --> 00:21:34.260
 They don't just have one basic burrow.

00:21:34.260 --> 00:21:36.180
 The way they know that is 'cause when you're researching

00:21:36.180 --> 00:21:38.620
 arctic ground squirrels, when researchers are researching them,

00:21:38.620 --> 00:21:40.540
 they have to make really detailed maps

00:21:40.540 --> 00:21:42.980
 of where all the burrow entrances and exits are,

00:21:42.980 --> 00:21:45.380
 so that if you take one away to study them,

00:21:45.380 --> 00:21:47.220
 when you put them back, you put them at the right door,

00:21:47.220 --> 00:21:49.780
 like you don't put them in someone else's house.

00:21:49.780 --> 00:21:51.860
 - So they don't notice when they wake up.

00:21:51.860 --> 00:21:53.060
 They have no idea someone's been

00:21:53.060 --> 00:21:54.620
 and rearranged the house, basically.

00:21:54.620 --> 00:21:56.100
 - I guess so, yeah, they don't wake up and go,

00:21:56.100 --> 00:21:57.940
 "Where am I? That's not my picture."

00:21:57.940 --> 00:22:01.020
 - You could put them the other way around

00:22:01.020 --> 00:22:03.180
 when they're hibernating just to freak them out.

00:22:03.180 --> 00:22:04.980
 - So they think, "Oh, lovely, I'll go to sleep facing

00:22:04.980 --> 00:22:06.700
 "my favorite nut," or whatever.

00:22:06.700 --> 00:22:10.100
 And then they wake up facing their second favorite nut,

00:22:10.100 --> 00:22:12.500
 and you've... - That's like my wife.

00:22:12.500 --> 00:22:15.140
 She goes to sleep facing her first favorite, Dan,

00:22:15.140 --> 00:22:18.900
 and she wakes up with a second, Dan.

00:22:18.900 --> 00:22:25.300
 - I mean, it did sound like you were gonna say

00:22:25.300 --> 00:22:27.060
 "facing her first favorite nut."

00:22:27.060 --> 00:22:30.060
 (audience laughing)

00:22:30.060 --> 00:22:36.940
 - Oh, poor woman.

00:22:36.940 --> 00:22:39.140
 - I was just a steer away for a second,

00:22:39.140 --> 00:22:41.100
 but on hibernation, I was reading a blog

00:22:41.100 --> 00:22:42.780
 about hibernating hedgehogs,

00:22:42.780 --> 00:22:45.780
 and there was this wonderful thing where a person says,

00:22:45.780 --> 00:22:48.540
 "A way that you can tell that a hedgehog is hibernating

00:22:48.540 --> 00:22:50.820
 "is 'cause they look like they're dead, basically,

00:22:50.820 --> 00:22:52.980
 "if you go up to them, they're in the ball.

00:22:52.980 --> 00:22:55.620
 "All you need to do is go right up to one,

00:22:55.620 --> 00:22:58.940
 "put your ear next to one, and you know it's hibernating

00:22:58.940 --> 00:23:00.740
 "'cause you can hear it snoring."

00:23:00.740 --> 00:23:03.500
 It's not sweet, a little (snoring)

00:23:03.500 --> 00:23:05.900
 of a hedgehog, and they snore when they hibernate,

00:23:05.900 --> 00:23:09.100
 not all of them sometimes, and possibly not even then,

00:23:09.100 --> 00:23:13.540
 but it's, yeah, it's just from a blog, but...

00:23:13.540 --> 00:23:15.420
 - That's really sweet.

00:23:15.420 --> 00:23:18.420
 I have a fact about squirrels, other squirrels,

00:23:18.420 --> 00:23:20.140
 Californian ground squirrels,

00:23:20.140 --> 00:23:21.660
 slightly different kind of ground squirrel.

00:23:21.660 --> 00:23:25.660
 So in 1918, California basically decided to wage war

00:23:25.660 --> 00:23:28.220
 on the squirrels, and they had something called Squirrel Week,

00:23:28.220 --> 00:23:30.260
 where posters were put up all over the state,

00:23:30.260 --> 00:23:32.700
 encouraging the children of California

00:23:32.700 --> 00:23:35.420
 to kill as many squirrels as they could.

00:23:35.420 --> 00:23:36.260
 - Whoa.

00:23:36.260 --> 00:23:37.940
 - And there were posters, just aimed at children,

00:23:37.940 --> 00:23:40.860
 saying things like, "Slay the mother squirrel

00:23:40.860 --> 00:23:43.700
 "during breeding season, March to May,"

00:23:43.700 --> 00:23:45.980
 'cause they were quite invasive, and they ate a lot of crops,

00:23:45.980 --> 00:23:48.260
 and they carried bubonic plague, which is a bad thing,

00:23:48.260 --> 00:23:51.340
 so there were reasons for it, but it was pretty dark,

00:23:51.340 --> 00:23:54.380
 so there was a pamphlet which advised how you could hook up

00:23:54.380 --> 00:23:56.420
 your exhaust pipe to a squirrel burrow.

00:23:56.420 --> 00:23:57.260
 - Jesus.

00:23:57.260 --> 00:23:59.540
 - And wipe out a whole batch of them, like that.

00:23:59.540 --> 00:24:02.300
 And they were depicted with little German soldier helmets,

00:24:02.300 --> 00:24:03.940
 because the First World War was still going on.

00:24:03.940 --> 00:24:06.140
 It was saying, "We may be fighting Germany,

00:24:06.140 --> 00:24:08.140
 "but we're also fighting the squirrels."

00:24:08.140 --> 00:24:10.500
 In Squirrel Week, the children of California

00:24:10.500 --> 00:24:13.940
 killed 104,000 squirrels just in that week.

00:24:13.940 --> 00:24:15.140
 - Oh.

00:24:15.140 --> 00:24:17.100
 - And there were prizes for the schools that did best.

00:24:17.100 --> 00:24:19.380
 - Yeah, wasn't there one girl who had like a kill list

00:24:19.380 --> 00:24:21.100
 of over 3,000, alone?

00:24:21.100 --> 00:24:22.180
 - I don't know, I didn't know that.

00:24:22.180 --> 00:24:24.500
 - Yeah, she was like the head of the top of the pack.

00:24:24.500 --> 00:24:26.820
 - She went on to single-handedly defeat the Nazis

00:24:26.820 --> 00:24:28.300
 to be on the following wall.

00:24:28.300 --> 00:24:30.460
 (laughing)

00:24:30.460 --> 00:24:33.660
 - The Cape Ground Squirrel is an interesting ground squirrel,

00:24:33.660 --> 00:24:37.540
 and that's because they can self-filate,

00:24:37.540 --> 00:24:39.900
 and not only can they do, they do so.

00:24:39.900 --> 00:24:42.460
 (laughing)

00:24:42.460 --> 00:24:43.300
 - You would.

00:24:43.300 --> 00:24:46.060
 - It's not like you and me just telling people we can do.

00:24:46.060 --> 00:24:46.900
 They prove it.

00:24:48.300 --> 00:24:49.220
 - Prove it.

00:24:49.220 --> 00:24:51.620
 (laughing)

00:24:51.620 --> 00:24:53.180
 - For God's sake, don't prove it.

00:24:53.180 --> 00:24:55.220
 (laughing)

00:24:55.220 --> 00:24:57.540
 - Not before you showed me your favorite nuts.

00:24:57.540 --> 00:24:58.380
 Right.

00:24:58.380 --> 00:25:00.020
 (laughing)

00:25:00.020 --> 00:25:04.180
 Can I get on about this self-masturbating squirrel?

00:25:04.180 --> 00:25:05.620
 - You know self-masturbating is the only

00:25:05.620 --> 00:25:07.020
 kind of masturbating, James.

00:25:07.020 --> 00:25:09.060
 (laughing)

00:25:09.060 --> 00:25:09.900
 - Well.

00:25:09.900 --> 00:25:12.140
 (laughing)

00:25:12.140 --> 00:25:15.340
 Go on.

00:25:15.340 --> 00:25:18.220
 - If I do the fact, some of it might get in the podcast.

00:25:18.220 --> 00:25:22.020
 - 'Cause if I masturbate a pig for the...

00:25:22.020 --> 00:25:23.820
 (laughing)

00:25:23.820 --> 00:25:25.180
 - I don't think you're masturbating.

00:25:25.180 --> 00:25:26.260
 I think you're just...

00:25:26.260 --> 00:25:27.100
 - You're giving it a handy.

00:25:27.100 --> 00:25:27.940
 - Yeah.

00:25:27.940 --> 00:25:28.900
 - No, no, no, no.

00:25:28.900 --> 00:25:31.260
 Because there's a breeding program for pigs.

00:25:31.260 --> 00:25:32.660
 I'm not just, I'm not just...

00:25:32.660 --> 00:25:35.860
 Sorry, just to dress the seam.

00:25:35.860 --> 00:25:37.300
 (laughing)

00:25:37.300 --> 00:25:40.340
 I think I would be masturbating that pig.

00:25:40.340 --> 00:25:42.940
 - I think technically that's probably not true.

00:25:42.940 --> 00:25:43.780
 - Really?

00:25:43.780 --> 00:25:45.180
 - I would say technically.

00:25:45.180 --> 00:25:47.500
 - Well, I've gotta go and refill in all the forms now.

00:25:47.500 --> 00:25:49.740
 (laughing)

00:25:49.740 --> 00:25:53.060
 - You've gotta rename the blog.

00:25:53.060 --> 00:25:55.300
 (laughing)

00:25:55.300 --> 00:26:07.740
 - So, squirrels, they do it supposedly

00:26:07.740 --> 00:26:10.740
 as a form of self-medication, okay?

00:26:10.740 --> 00:26:12.980
 And the idea is that if they clean their genitals,

00:26:12.980 --> 00:26:16.100
 it might stop them from getting an STI, okay?

00:26:16.100 --> 00:26:19.860
 And the best way for them to do that is to masturbate.

00:26:19.860 --> 00:26:21.660
 However, they live in the desert

00:26:21.660 --> 00:26:24.700
 and they can't afford to lose any water.

00:26:24.700 --> 00:26:28.780
 And so they need to get the water back into their body.

00:26:28.780 --> 00:26:31.060
 And so they clean their genitals

00:26:31.060 --> 00:26:34.020
 and they take in their fluids.

00:26:34.020 --> 00:26:35.340
 - Okay.

00:26:35.340 --> 00:26:37.620
 It's base two and base three is what you're saying.

00:26:37.620 --> 00:26:39.500
 (laughing)

00:26:39.500 --> 00:26:40.340
 - Base five.

00:26:40.340 --> 00:26:43.620
 Golly.

00:26:43.620 --> 00:26:44.460
 - Well, gosh.

00:26:44.460 --> 00:26:46.220
 - Now, whatever works.

00:26:46.220 --> 00:26:47.380
 - That's the thing about this podcast,

00:26:47.380 --> 00:26:50.180
 you always learn something you didn't know before.

00:26:50.180 --> 00:26:51.180
 - But there are, yeah.

00:26:51.180 --> 00:26:53.340
 Right, well, let's.

00:26:53.340 --> 00:26:55.500
 - We've actually got to move on, guys.

00:26:55.500 --> 00:26:57.500
 (laughing)

00:26:57.500 --> 00:26:59.780
 We don't actually need to, but I really think we should.

00:26:59.780 --> 00:27:01.260
 (laughing)

00:27:01.260 --> 00:27:02.860
 I have one more thing about,

00:27:02.860 --> 00:27:05.020
 this was about going to the Lou in the middle of the night.

00:27:05.020 --> 00:27:05.860
 - Oh, yeah.

00:27:05.860 --> 00:27:09.580
 - So Victorian tourists, I mean 19th century tourists,

00:27:09.580 --> 00:27:12.140
 what you would do if you were a tourist in France

00:27:12.140 --> 00:27:14.700
 because lots of, you know, accommodation

00:27:14.700 --> 00:27:17.740
 would not have much in the way of sanitation.

00:27:17.740 --> 00:27:19.420
 Women would purchase an object

00:27:19.420 --> 00:27:22.340
 which was sold called the Inodorous Standard Pale,

00:27:22.340 --> 00:27:23.940
 okay, and pale is in bucket.

00:27:23.940 --> 00:27:25.700
 And it had a mahogany rim

00:27:25.700 --> 00:27:27.940
 and a hermetically closing cover.

00:27:27.940 --> 00:27:29.500
 And it was basically a,

00:27:29.500 --> 00:27:31.300
 what are we calling it, kind of chamber pot.

00:27:31.300 --> 00:27:32.340
 But the brilliant thing was

00:27:32.340 --> 00:27:34.380
 it was disguised as a hat box

00:27:34.380 --> 00:27:37.140
 so that you could carry it around without embarrassment.

00:27:37.140 --> 00:27:38.260
 (laughing)

00:27:38.260 --> 00:27:40.060
 - But you definitely don't want to put your hats in it.

00:27:40.060 --> 00:27:42.780
 If someone asks, can I borrow your hat box?

00:27:42.780 --> 00:27:45.620
 I've got a hat spare hat I need to carry.

00:27:45.620 --> 00:27:46.860
 What is the excuse,

00:27:46.860 --> 00:27:48.980
 the recommended excuse you're supposed to cook?

00:27:48.980 --> 00:27:49.820
 - I don't know.

00:27:49.820 --> 00:27:50.860
 - But it is a good excuse

00:27:50.860 --> 00:27:53.180
 if you accidentally piss in someone's hat box.

00:27:53.180 --> 00:27:55.420
 (laughing)

00:27:55.420 --> 00:28:00.660
 - We need to move on to our next fact.

00:28:00.660 --> 00:28:04.660
 Okay, it is time for fact number three,

00:28:04.660 --> 00:28:06.380
 and that is James.

00:28:06.380 --> 00:28:10.040
 - Okay, my fact this week is that in 1385,

00:28:10.040 --> 00:28:12.620
 a four year court case began

00:28:12.620 --> 00:28:16.140
 after two nights embarrassingly turned up to a battle

00:28:16.140 --> 00:28:18.540
 wearing the same coat of arms.

00:28:18.540 --> 00:28:21.100
 (laughing)

00:28:21.100 --> 00:28:22.220
 How embarrassing.

00:28:22.220 --> 00:28:24.260
 - Yeah, were they completely mortified?

00:28:24.260 --> 00:28:25.100
 Did someone go home?

00:28:25.100 --> 00:28:26.380
 Did they both fight the battle?

00:28:26.380 --> 00:28:27.660
 - They both fought the battle.

00:28:27.660 --> 00:28:30.140
 It was a bit later that the court case happened.

00:28:30.140 --> 00:28:33.580
 So this was during the Hundred Years War with France

00:28:33.580 --> 00:28:37.580
 in 1385 and Scotland had signed a pact with France

00:28:37.580 --> 00:28:39.500
 and some French soldiers had arrived

00:28:39.500 --> 00:28:40.800
 north of the border.

00:28:40.800 --> 00:28:43.000
 And so Richard II just come of age

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:45.280
 trying to kind of show that he meant business.

00:28:45.280 --> 00:28:47.680
 He decided he was gonna invade Scotland.

00:28:47.680 --> 00:28:49.480
 And so they all went over this big army

00:28:49.480 --> 00:28:50.680
 to invade Scotland.

00:28:50.680 --> 00:28:54.040
 And when they did, there was a guy called Richard Scroop,

00:28:54.040 --> 00:28:55.880
 spelled Scroop but pronounced Scroop.

00:28:55.880 --> 00:28:57.920
 He was the first Baron of Bolton.

00:28:57.920 --> 00:29:00.120
 And so Robert Grovesner of Cheshire

00:29:00.120 --> 00:29:02.200
 and they both turned up and they realized

00:29:02.200 --> 00:29:04.320
 that they had the exact same coat of arms,

00:29:04.320 --> 00:29:07.440
 which was an azure with a bend or,

00:29:07.440 --> 00:29:10.520
 that's a blue background with a gold stash.

00:29:10.520 --> 00:29:12.640
 And everyone felt very awkward.

00:29:12.640 --> 00:29:16.080
 - The court case sounds amazing.

00:29:16.080 --> 00:29:17.940
 - The court case really was,

00:29:17.940 --> 00:29:20.140
 it was the who's who of the 14th century.

00:29:20.140 --> 00:29:20.980
 - Really?

00:29:20.980 --> 00:29:21.820
 Well, it was a bit of,

00:29:21.820 --> 00:29:23.060
 I think it was a bit of a fix, this court case.

00:29:23.060 --> 00:29:24.320
 So it was, who'd you say?

00:29:24.320 --> 00:29:28.300
 It was Scroop of Bolton against Grovesner of Cheshire.

00:29:28.300 --> 00:29:30.860
 But it was held, I think, in York Minster.

00:29:30.860 --> 00:29:32.980
 And in York Minster, the Scroop coat of arms

00:29:32.980 --> 00:29:33.900
 was all over the place.

00:29:33.900 --> 00:29:36.220
 So it's kind of subtle branding for the Scroop side.

00:29:36.220 --> 00:29:38.920
 - Yeah, I should say it's not the good Bolton in Lancashire.

00:29:38.920 --> 00:29:40.560
 It's the shit Bolton in Yorkshire.

00:29:40.560 --> 00:29:41.400
 - Ah.

00:29:41.400 --> 00:29:44.240
 - Okay.

00:29:44.240 --> 00:29:45.980
 - Right.

00:29:45.980 --> 00:29:46.820
 - Got it.

00:29:46.820 --> 00:29:47.900
 - He's got that off his chest.

00:29:47.900 --> 00:29:50.160
 - That's why in York Minster they had his coat of arms.

00:29:50.160 --> 00:29:51.000
 - Got it, got it, got it.

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:51.840
 That makes more sense, actually.

00:29:51.840 --> 00:29:52.680
 I was wondering about that.

00:29:52.680 --> 00:29:53.500
 - Yeah.

00:29:53.500 --> 00:29:54.340
 - But then it turned out later on,

00:29:54.340 --> 00:29:55.240
 after this court case was over,

00:29:55.240 --> 00:29:58.560
 there was a third family also using the same coat of arms.

00:29:58.560 --> 00:30:00.260
 But they were in Cornwall and everyone said,

00:30:00.260 --> 00:30:01.260
 oh, well it's Cornwall.

00:30:01.260 --> 00:30:03.200
 You know, they said, basically they said,

00:30:03.200 --> 00:30:04.080
 well, it's a different country.

00:30:04.080 --> 00:30:05.120
 So the rules are different there.

00:30:05.120 --> 00:30:06.680
 - Yes, at the time it was.

00:30:06.680 --> 00:30:08.960
 - Well, also the guy in Cornwall who claimed

00:30:08.960 --> 00:30:12.140
 that his crest was the same was a guy called Carmenow.

00:30:12.140 --> 00:30:15.900
 And he claimed that his crest had been given by King Arthur,

00:30:15.900 --> 00:30:18.280
 which was quite impressive considering he didn't exist.

00:30:18.280 --> 00:30:19.540
 (laughing)

00:30:19.540 --> 00:30:21.980
 - We didn't definitively not exist.

00:30:21.980 --> 00:30:22.820
 - What?

00:30:22.820 --> 00:30:24.500
 - Yeah, King Arthur didn't definitively not exist.

00:30:24.500 --> 00:30:27.700
 There are later reports of a character called Arthur.

00:30:27.700 --> 00:30:29.580
 Anyway, we don't, but he's not an absolute,

00:30:29.580 --> 00:30:31.020
 he's not like Peter Pan.

00:30:31.020 --> 00:30:32.420
 - Well, it's a good job you weren't in charge

00:30:32.420 --> 00:30:33.580
 of this court case either.

00:30:33.580 --> 00:30:35.100
 (laughing)

00:30:35.100 --> 00:30:37.140
 - Wow, so there's maybe a King Arthur.

00:30:37.140 --> 00:30:39.520
 - He didn't do any of the stuff.

00:30:39.520 --> 00:30:40.480
 - Well, that sucks.

00:30:40.480 --> 00:30:41.320
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:30:41.320 --> 00:30:42.160
 (laughing)

00:30:42.160 --> 00:30:43.600
 - That's just a guy called Arthur then.

00:30:43.600 --> 00:30:45.600
 (laughing)

00:30:45.600 --> 00:30:46.920
 - It's kind of like Robin Hood.

00:30:46.920 --> 00:30:48.040
 There's someone with the name,

00:30:48.040 --> 00:30:49.160
 but none of the rest of it's true.

00:30:49.160 --> 00:30:50.760
 So it's not even worth it.

00:30:50.760 --> 00:30:51.600
 - Okay.

00:30:51.600 --> 00:30:52.960
 - Who was who of the 14th century?

00:30:52.960 --> 00:30:54.480
 I want to know what a court case of the,

00:30:54.480 --> 00:30:55.800
 who's who of the 14th century was.

00:30:55.800 --> 00:30:57.960
 - They named a single person for the 14th century.

00:30:57.960 --> 00:31:00.920
 They were that, what was that, Geoffrey Charter?

00:31:00.920 --> 00:31:02.560
 - Yes, exactly.

00:31:02.560 --> 00:31:04.520
 What was that, John of Gaunt?

00:31:04.520 --> 00:31:05.720
 - Owen Glendauer?

00:31:05.720 --> 00:31:06.900
 - Yes, him as well.

00:31:06.900 --> 00:31:08.320
 - That really is a who to.

00:31:08.320 --> 00:31:10.220
 - Anyone I've heard of in the 14th century

00:31:10.220 --> 00:31:11.500
 was in this court case.

00:31:11.500 --> 00:31:14.620
 - Was this the most exciting court case of the era?

00:31:14.620 --> 00:31:15.820
 - It doesn't sound like a big deal.

00:31:15.820 --> 00:31:16.660
 - It really wasn't.

00:31:16.660 --> 00:31:17.560
 It was quite dull.

00:31:17.560 --> 00:31:18.880
 (laughing)

00:31:18.880 --> 00:31:20.540
 It was just basically, everyone came in.

00:31:20.540 --> 00:31:22.740
 And so let's say John of Gaunt turned up.

00:31:22.740 --> 00:31:24.880
 John of Gaunt would go in and he would say,

00:31:24.880 --> 00:31:27.620
 "I once saw this guy with this coat of arms on this date.

00:31:27.620 --> 00:31:29.660
 And I saw this guy with a coat of arms on this date.

00:31:29.660 --> 00:31:30.940
 And I saw this on this date."

00:31:30.940 --> 00:31:32.740
 And then they got all of the evidence together

00:31:32.740 --> 00:31:35.480
 and they worked out who had the best claim on it.

00:31:35.480 --> 00:31:36.800
 - Yeah, precedence, wasn't it?

00:31:36.800 --> 00:31:37.640
 - Exactly.

00:31:37.640 --> 00:31:38.480
 - Yeah, who would assume it at first.

00:31:38.480 --> 00:31:41.800
 So this was in the court of chivalry.

00:31:41.800 --> 00:31:43.600
 And the court of chivalry is an exciting thing

00:31:43.600 --> 00:31:46.400
 because this is a real court that exists

00:31:46.400 --> 00:31:49.640
 and it hasn't sat since 1954, okay?

00:31:49.640 --> 00:31:51.280
 - It really is dead, isn't it?

00:31:51.280 --> 00:31:54.520
 - Well, it might be coming back.

00:31:54.520 --> 00:31:57.520
 - Wait a minute, but what were the knights of armor in 1954?

00:31:57.520 --> 00:31:59.760
 - Oh, the 1954 case was a dispute

00:31:59.760 --> 00:32:02.620
 between Manchester Corporation and Manchester Palace

00:32:02.620 --> 00:32:06.420
 of Varieties over unlicensed use of the Manchester coat of arms.

00:32:06.420 --> 00:32:09.860
 That is dull, but before that, so, okay,

00:32:09.860 --> 00:32:11.940
 there is a chance that the court of chivalry

00:32:11.940 --> 00:32:14.020
 is going to have to sit sometime soon

00:32:14.020 --> 00:32:16.060
 because of weather spoons, okay?

00:32:16.060 --> 00:32:17.540
 This is so exciting.

00:32:17.540 --> 00:32:22.540
 So last year, last year, Barry Town Council in Wales.

00:32:22.540 --> 00:32:24.180
 - I thought that was his name.

00:32:24.180 --> 00:32:26.500
 (all laughing)

00:32:26.500 --> 00:32:28.420
 What an unfortunate Sunday night.

00:32:28.420 --> 00:32:30.680
 - No, he invented the Town Council.

00:32:30.680 --> 00:32:31.560
 It's very impressive.

00:32:31.560 --> 00:32:32.980
 Yeah, what a guy.

00:32:32.980 --> 00:32:35.560
 Sorry, yeah.

00:32:35.560 --> 00:32:37.100
 Barry Town Council in Wales.

00:32:37.100 --> 00:32:40.640
 They were furious with weather spoons

00:32:40.640 --> 00:32:42.560
 because weather spoons in Barry

00:32:42.560 --> 00:32:45.720
 had put the coat of arms of Barry,

00:32:45.720 --> 00:32:49.840
 the Barry coat of arms on a carpet in their pub.

00:32:49.840 --> 00:32:51.360
 - Oh, wow. - And Barry Town Council said,

00:32:51.360 --> 00:32:53.240
 hang on a second, you've got people walking

00:32:53.240 --> 00:32:55.880
 on the Barry coat of arms, maybe they're going to the bar,

00:32:55.880 --> 00:32:57.520
 maybe they're going to the toilet.

00:32:57.520 --> 00:32:58.740
 We don't know where they're going.

00:32:58.740 --> 00:33:00.400
 You know, maybe they've got a dog with them.

00:33:00.400 --> 00:33:02.560
 I mean, they said it was very disrespectful.

00:33:02.560 --> 00:33:04.080
 Tim Martin, the boss of weather spoons,

00:33:04.080 --> 00:33:05.660
 refused to remove the carpet.

00:33:05.660 --> 00:33:07.360
 He said it's a perfectly good carpet.

00:33:07.360 --> 00:33:08.980
 We paid a lot of money for it.

00:33:08.980 --> 00:33:10.500
 Just let it wear out and we'll replace it

00:33:10.500 --> 00:33:11.740
 in 10 years or so, whatever.

00:33:11.740 --> 00:33:14.580
 So they may yet go to the court of chivalry

00:33:14.580 --> 00:33:16.120
 if anyone can be bothered to.

00:33:16.120 --> 00:33:17.360
 - Cool.

00:33:17.360 --> 00:33:19.480
 - Yeah, and they'll have to resurrect the entire court.

00:33:19.480 --> 00:33:20.620
 - And do you think it will be a who's

00:33:20.620 --> 00:33:23.440
 who of the 21st century with sort of George Clooney,

00:33:23.440 --> 00:33:24.780
 Barack Obama?

00:33:24.780 --> 00:33:27.600
 (all laughing)

00:33:27.600 --> 00:33:29.180
 Have you ever met Barry Town Council?

00:33:29.180 --> 00:33:32.260
 I've met Barry Town Council, yeah.

00:33:32.260 --> 00:33:35.040
 - I love the rules of chivalry, the whole chivalry thing.

00:33:35.040 --> 00:33:37.380
 I didn't quite know what goes into becoming a knight

00:33:37.380 --> 00:33:39.780
 when you were made and you were kind of trained

00:33:39.780 --> 00:33:42.420
 in order to become one, but it was more than battle.

00:33:42.420 --> 00:33:45.140
 It was all these things like you had to learn

00:33:45.140 --> 00:33:46.780
 how to box, wrestle, run.

00:33:46.780 --> 00:33:47.940
 You had to read, write.

00:33:47.940 --> 00:33:49.460
 You had to play the harp and sing.

00:33:49.460 --> 00:33:51.580
 That was part of becoming a knight, yeah,

00:33:51.580 --> 00:33:52.820
 which is really sweet.

00:33:52.820 --> 00:33:55.020
 - You also, you had to be a very good wooer.

00:33:55.020 --> 00:33:57.240
 That was part of the code of chivalry,

00:33:57.240 --> 00:33:59.900
 was you had to devotedly woo one woman.

00:33:59.900 --> 00:34:01.860
 And it didn't, the woman could be married.

00:34:01.860 --> 00:34:03.260
 That was fine, Lancelot, I think,

00:34:03.260 --> 00:34:05.300
 was constantly wooing a married woman.

00:34:05.300 --> 00:34:07.700
 - Again, possibly didn't exist or?

00:34:07.700 --> 00:34:10.540
 - No, yeah, yeah, he was a figure of chivalric mythology.

00:34:10.540 --> 00:34:13.300
 But, you know, he was like a being to emulate.

00:34:13.300 --> 00:34:14.780
 - He was wooing Gwynevere, wasn't he?

00:34:14.780 --> 00:34:15.940
 - Yeah, I thought he went for--

00:34:15.940 --> 00:34:17.380
 - He went for the top trumps.

00:34:17.380 --> 00:34:18.220
 - Top trumps, yeah. - I really went for it.

00:34:18.220 --> 00:34:19.060
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:34:19.060 --> 00:34:19.900
 - Martha's wife, yeah.

00:34:19.900 --> 00:34:20.980
 - You can't all hope for Gwynevere.

00:34:20.980 --> 00:34:24.380
 - Gwynevere also, I think, a figure of chivalric myth,

00:34:24.380 --> 00:34:25.380
 so not real.

00:34:25.380 --> 00:34:27.860
 - So all of these people are setting the standard

00:34:27.860 --> 00:34:29.060
 that you're supposed to imitate.

00:34:29.060 --> 00:34:30.740
 And the reason it all came in, the chivalric codes,

00:34:30.740 --> 00:34:32.900
 was 'cause knights were so badly behaved.

00:34:32.900 --> 00:34:35.500
 They were just like, rampant around the countryside.

00:34:35.500 --> 00:34:37.180
 So there were lots of books written

00:34:37.180 --> 00:34:39.860
 about how to correct knight's behavior.

00:34:39.860 --> 00:34:41.860
 And so there were all these courtesy books written

00:34:41.860 --> 00:34:44.420
 in the sort of 12th century and 13th century.

00:34:44.420 --> 00:34:46.340
 There was one called The Book of the Civilized Man,

00:34:46.340 --> 00:34:47.260
 directed at knights.

00:34:47.260 --> 00:34:51.700
 And it just had sort of a bullet-pointed list of rules.

00:34:51.700 --> 00:34:54.500
 So don't spit, don't talk with your mouth full.

00:34:54.500 --> 00:34:55.980
 Don't take huge helpings,

00:34:55.980 --> 00:34:58.460
 don't blow your nose on the tablecloth.

00:34:58.460 --> 00:35:01.380
 All things today that we would agree with.

00:35:01.380 --> 00:35:02.700
 - Don't wind off a pig.

00:35:02.700 --> 00:35:05.540
 (audience laughing)

00:35:05.540 --> 00:35:07.380
 - Don't auto-filate a mixed company.

00:35:07.380 --> 00:35:10.140
 (audience laughing)

00:35:10.140 --> 00:35:11.900
 You may be thirsty, but the bar's over there.

00:35:11.900 --> 00:35:14.220
 (audience laughing)

00:35:14.220 --> 00:35:15.500
 - There was a don't defecate.

00:35:15.500 --> 00:35:17.620
 Well, sorry, there was.

00:35:17.620 --> 00:35:18.660
 You weren't allowed to defecate.

00:35:18.660 --> 00:35:20.300
 You weren't allowed to attack your enemy

00:35:20.300 --> 00:35:21.580
 while he was defecating.

00:35:21.580 --> 00:35:23.260
 (audience laughing)

00:35:23.260 --> 00:35:25.100
 Unchivalrous, yeah.

00:35:25.100 --> 00:35:27.580
 - Unless he's riding a horse to cure his diarrhea,

00:35:27.580 --> 00:35:30.060
 in which case, he's on a horse, he's fair game.

00:35:30.060 --> 00:35:31.180
 - Yeah.

00:35:31.180 --> 00:35:33.140
 - Wow, have you heard of the Scottish court

00:35:33.140 --> 00:35:35.140
 and what they do to badly behaving knights?

00:35:35.140 --> 00:35:38.540
 They will destroy your arms, I presume, your coat of arms.

00:35:38.540 --> 00:35:42.540
 (audience laughing)

00:35:42.540 --> 00:35:43.380
 It will be very mean.

00:35:43.380 --> 00:35:44.940
 They will break your stained glass windows,

00:35:44.940 --> 00:35:46.680
 which have got your coat of arms in them.

00:35:46.680 --> 00:35:49.860
 They will smash any unwarranted seals.

00:35:49.860 --> 00:35:52.860
 (audience laughing)

00:35:52.860 --> 00:35:54.860
 Seals, like seals.

00:35:54.860 --> 00:35:58.180
 But then they will issue a letter of horning, okay?

00:35:58.180 --> 00:35:59.020
 - Of what, sorry?

00:35:59.020 --> 00:36:01.120
 - Of horning, like horn, the horn.

00:36:01.120 --> 00:36:02.020
 - Yeah, sorry.

00:36:02.020 --> 00:36:05.460
 - Like, I've just given this pig the horn for my dog.

00:36:05.460 --> 00:36:08.300
 (audience laughing)

00:36:08.300 --> 00:36:10.700
 But they do a letter, which denounces you as an outlaw,

00:36:10.700 --> 00:36:13.060
 and then they have three blasts of a horn,

00:36:13.060 --> 00:36:16.220
 and that means you have technically been put to the horn.

00:36:16.220 --> 00:36:17.780
 Pretty exciting stuff, yeah.

00:36:17.780 --> 00:36:18.780
 (audience laughing)

00:36:18.780 --> 00:36:20.100
 - And wait, what does that mean to have been put,

00:36:20.100 --> 00:36:21.780
 aside from the fact that you do three blasts of a horn,

00:36:21.780 --> 00:36:22.620
 but what's that do to you?

00:36:22.620 --> 00:36:24.060
 - I don't actually know what the ramifications are.

00:36:24.060 --> 00:36:26.100
 - You're not a knight anymore, right?

00:36:26.100 --> 00:36:26.940
 You're a knight.

00:36:26.940 --> 00:36:27.780
 - Yeah, you're not a knight.

00:36:27.780 --> 00:36:28.660
 You've been put to the horn.

00:36:28.660 --> 00:36:31.380
 - Do you know why they're called coats of arms?

00:36:31.380 --> 00:36:33.980
 It's because you used to have a coat that you wore

00:36:33.980 --> 00:36:36.300
 over your arms, your armor,

00:36:36.300 --> 00:36:37.460
 and that's where the word comes from.

00:36:37.460 --> 00:36:38.300
 - Really?

00:36:38.300 --> 00:36:39.140
 - Isn't that amazing?

00:36:39.140 --> 00:36:41.380
 - But everyone was hoping that it was a coat made of arms.

00:36:41.380 --> 00:36:43.180
 - Yeah.

00:36:43.180 --> 00:36:44.100
 - That's the dream.

00:36:44.100 --> 00:36:45.500
 - But you used to have your armor,

00:36:45.500 --> 00:36:47.300
 and you would always wear a cloak over it,

00:36:47.300 --> 00:36:50.220
 and the reason being that if you're fighting somewhere hot,

00:36:50.220 --> 00:36:52.420
 then wearing armor is pretty bad,

00:36:52.420 --> 00:36:54.300
 like you're basically gonna cook in there,

00:36:54.300 --> 00:36:55.460
 and so if you wore a cloak,

00:36:55.460 --> 00:36:56.940
 then it could stop you from getting,

00:36:56.940 --> 00:36:59.020
 from the sun's rays from cooking you,

00:36:59.020 --> 00:37:00.820
 and so you would always have to wear this cloak,

00:37:00.820 --> 00:37:01.940
 and on the back of the cloak,

00:37:01.940 --> 00:37:04.620
 it would have your arms, your coat of arms,

00:37:04.620 --> 00:37:06.020
 and so that's where the word came from.

00:37:06.020 --> 00:37:06.860
 - Wow. - Hey.

00:37:06.860 --> 00:37:07.700
 - It's not cool, yeah.

00:37:07.700 --> 00:37:09.700
 - Superman, basically, like the original.

00:37:09.700 --> 00:37:10.540
 - Yeah.

00:37:10.540 --> 00:37:11.360
 - Saying who you are.

00:37:11.360 --> 00:37:13.340
 - If you go on your back, that's so cool.

00:37:13.340 --> 00:37:15.660
 - And the idea was you wanted people to know who you are,

00:37:15.660 --> 00:37:17.940
 because if you're an important person in a battle,

00:37:17.940 --> 00:37:19.620
 you don't wanna be killed, you wanna be captured.

00:37:19.620 --> 00:37:20.860
 Well, you don't wanna be captured.

00:37:20.860 --> 00:37:24.180
 You wanna win, but if you're your second best,

00:37:24.180 --> 00:37:26.660
 if you don't win, is to not die.

00:37:26.660 --> 00:37:29.900
 - The team talking, like the halfway mark, right?

00:37:29.900 --> 00:37:31.420
 We've given up on a win,

00:37:31.420 --> 00:37:33.800
 but we are going for being captured, all of us.

00:37:33.800 --> 00:37:38.980
 - So yeah, so you wanted to be captured,

00:37:38.980 --> 00:37:40.860
 and so you would have this kind of coat of armor,

00:37:40.860 --> 00:37:43.760
 so that people would see you on battle and not kill you.

00:37:43.760 --> 00:37:45.320
 They'd think, oh, well, he's worth something.

00:37:45.320 --> 00:37:47.080
 I'm gonna take him instead of killing him,

00:37:47.080 --> 00:37:48.400
 and then I'll be able to get some money.

00:37:48.400 --> 00:37:50.880
 - Quite catching someone else's shiny pog.

00:37:50.880 --> 00:37:51.720
 - Is it? - Yeah.

00:37:51.720 --> 00:37:53.780
 - Yeah, that was a very specific,

00:37:53.780 --> 00:37:57.280
 sort of 1994 kids there.

00:37:57.280 --> 00:38:00.200
 Jeff Bezos has a coat of arms.

00:38:00.200 --> 00:38:02.720
 Yeah, it's got two tortoises and a rocket.

00:38:02.720 --> 00:38:03.560
 - A rocket?

00:38:03.560 --> 00:38:04.400
 - Yeah.

00:38:04.400 --> 00:38:06.680
 - I'm just imagining a cock on bull's formation.

00:38:06.680 --> 00:38:09.480
 (audience laughing)

00:38:09.480 --> 00:38:10.800
 - You know what, I haven't seen it.

00:38:10.800 --> 00:38:11.620
 - I presume it is.

00:38:11.620 --> 00:38:12.460
 - It's kind of good.

00:38:12.460 --> 00:38:13.300
 - It's kind of good to assume.

00:38:13.300 --> 00:38:14.140
 It's Jeff Bezos.

00:38:14.140 --> 00:38:14.980
 - Absolutely.

00:38:14.980 --> 00:38:16.780
 You can just get them made though,

00:38:16.780 --> 00:38:19.460
 'cause there's the College of Arms in the UK

00:38:19.460 --> 00:38:20.460
 except Scotland.

00:38:20.460 --> 00:38:23.100
 Do you know what the Blue Mantle Persuivant

00:38:23.100 --> 00:38:25.180
 at the College of Arms gets paid each year?

00:38:25.180 --> 00:38:26.620
 - I didn't know what most of those words were.

00:38:26.620 --> 00:38:27.460
 - No.

00:38:27.460 --> 00:38:28.300
 (audience laughing)

00:38:28.300 --> 00:38:29.180
 - There's a lot of kind of

00:38:29.180 --> 00:38:30.020
 cod latin and comprehension stuff.

00:38:30.020 --> 00:38:32.140
 No, Blue Mantle Persuivant, or Persuivant,

00:38:32.140 --> 00:38:34.140
 is a junior position at the College of Arms.

00:38:34.140 --> 00:38:36.100
 Guess what he gets paid.

00:38:36.100 --> 00:38:39.140
 - A tenner a year, or seven shillings and six pence,

00:38:39.140 --> 00:38:40.180
 half a crown.

00:38:40.180 --> 00:38:42.600
 Three sticks and a dead porcupine.

00:38:42.600 --> 00:38:43.440
 - Lovely.

00:38:43.440 --> 00:38:44.760
 - Pogs.

00:38:44.760 --> 00:38:45.600
 Pogs.

00:38:45.600 --> 00:38:46.960
 (audience laughing)

00:38:46.960 --> 00:38:49.280
 - Anna was closest, it's $13.95.

00:38:49.280 --> 00:38:50.120
 - Really?

00:38:50.120 --> 00:38:52.720
 - For the ceremony where he was invested in his role,

00:38:52.720 --> 00:38:54.280
 he had to buy a pair of silk tights

00:38:54.280 --> 00:38:56.320
 which cost double his annual salary.

00:38:56.320 --> 00:38:57.280
 (audience laughing)

00:38:57.280 --> 00:38:59.800
 - And is that taxpayer funded for God's sake?

00:38:59.800 --> 00:39:02.480
 (audience laughing)

00:39:02.480 --> 00:39:03.400
 - Who knows?

00:39:03.400 --> 00:39:06.360
 Do you know what all those weird words you just said?

00:39:06.360 --> 00:39:08.920
 All that language, do you know what it's called?

00:39:08.920 --> 00:39:09.760
 - No.

00:39:09.760 --> 00:39:10.820
 - It's called Blazen.

00:39:10.820 --> 00:39:13.700
 So in heraldry, the weird language of heraldry,

00:39:13.700 --> 00:39:15.180
 which is lots of stuff that we don't understand,

00:39:15.180 --> 00:39:17.220
 it's called Blazen, and all the vocab,

00:39:17.220 --> 00:39:20.620
 and it's also related to the habits of heraldry,

00:39:20.620 --> 00:39:21.820
 so all the traditions.

00:39:21.820 --> 00:39:23.900
 So for instance, there's a difference between English

00:39:23.900 --> 00:39:26.580
 and Scottish heraldry in Blazen.

00:39:26.580 --> 00:39:30.420
 And that is how you erase a bear's head.

00:39:30.420 --> 00:39:33.260
 And so this is, you know, if you see a coat of arms,

00:39:33.260 --> 00:39:34.980
 then you'll sometimes have an animal,

00:39:34.980 --> 00:39:36.660
 like a lion or a bear on it.

00:39:36.660 --> 00:39:38.580
 And if you've got an erased head,

00:39:38.580 --> 00:39:40.440
 what that means is a head that's been decapitated

00:39:40.440 --> 00:39:42.200
 from a body, or it looks like it's been torn off

00:39:42.200 --> 00:39:43.120
 from a body.

00:39:43.120 --> 00:39:45.960
 So it's got sort of ragged edges in the neck.

00:39:45.960 --> 00:39:46.880
 You will have seen it a lot.

00:39:46.880 --> 00:39:48.120
 But the way you tell the difference between

00:39:48.120 --> 00:39:50.520
 an English coat of arms and a Scottish coat of arms is,

00:39:50.520 --> 00:39:54.560
 a bear's head in English heraldry is erased horizontally

00:39:54.560 --> 00:39:55.640
 under the neck.

00:39:55.640 --> 00:39:57.760
 And so it goes across and you get some neck in.

00:39:57.760 --> 00:40:00.680
 Whereas in Scotland, it's erased vertically

00:40:00.680 --> 00:40:02.120
 and you cut the neck off.

00:40:02.120 --> 00:40:04.400
 So if you imagine a vertical line going down.

00:40:04.400 --> 00:40:07.400
 So if a bear's got a neck, English, no neck,

00:40:07.400 --> 00:40:08.820
 Scottish.

00:40:08.820 --> 00:40:10.980
 - We've been doing this podcast for six and a half years now.

00:40:10.980 --> 00:40:13.420
 And I think that is the least useful piece of information.

00:40:13.420 --> 00:40:15.820
 (audience laughing)

00:40:15.820 --> 00:40:16.660
 - Ever said.

00:40:16.660 --> 00:40:20.020
 - Addy, if you are galloping into battle against the Scots,

00:40:20.020 --> 00:40:22.740
 which may well happen in the near future.

00:40:22.740 --> 00:40:23.740
 (audience laughing)

00:40:23.740 --> 00:40:25.180
 You're gonna need to know.

00:40:25.180 --> 00:40:27.760
 (upbeat music)

00:40:27.760 --> 00:40:33.140
 - We need to move on to our final fact of the show.

00:40:33.140 --> 00:40:35.340
 It is time for our final fact of the show.

00:40:35.340 --> 00:40:38.480
 And that is Anna.

00:40:38.480 --> 00:40:41.760
 - My fact this week is that the Audubon Bird Protection

00:40:41.760 --> 00:40:45.900
 Society has warned its members against bird-splaining.

00:40:45.900 --> 00:40:48.080
 (audience laughing)

00:40:48.080 --> 00:40:50.800
 - So, mansplaining is when a man annoyingly.

00:40:50.800 --> 00:40:53.800
 (audience laughing)

00:40:53.800 --> 00:40:59.520
 So, but if mansplaining is when a man is awkwardly

00:40:59.520 --> 00:41:01.080
 explaining something which he doesn't need to,

00:41:01.080 --> 00:41:03.560
 is bird-splaining when a bird explains something to you?

00:41:03.560 --> 00:41:04.640
 (audience laughing)

00:41:04.640 --> 00:41:06.020
 - We don't call them birds these days,

00:41:06.020 --> 00:41:06.860
 we call them women.

00:41:06.860 --> 00:41:09.860
 (audience laughing)

00:41:09.860 --> 00:41:15.500
 - I've been asleep for 270 days.

00:41:15.500 --> 00:41:17.060
 (audience laughing)

00:41:17.060 --> 00:41:19.440
 And my testicles are so sore.

00:41:19.440 --> 00:41:21.780
 (audience laughing)

00:41:21.780 --> 00:41:23.780
 - It's not, you're right, it's an incorrect use

00:41:23.780 --> 00:41:26.700
 of the explaining etymology because it's not like

00:41:26.700 --> 00:41:28.420
 when a pigeon gets really patronizing.

00:41:28.420 --> 00:41:31.900
 It's basically, this is an article on the Audubon website

00:41:31.900 --> 00:41:35.320
 which is sort of the authority on birds.

00:41:35.320 --> 00:41:37.920
 And it was a bird writer, Becca Heisman.

00:41:37.920 --> 00:41:41.280
 She was sort of inspired by birdwatchers who do things

00:41:41.280 --> 00:41:44.640
 like get extremely agitated if people refer to

00:41:44.640 --> 00:41:47.360
 a Canadian goose as opposed to a Canada goose

00:41:47.360 --> 00:41:49.200
 or a seagull.

00:41:49.200 --> 00:41:51.120
 Birdwatchers hate people calling it a seagull

00:41:51.120 --> 00:41:52.600
 'cause there's no such thing as a seagull.

00:41:52.600 --> 00:41:55.040
 There are gulls, lot of them don't live by the sea.

00:41:55.040 --> 00:41:56.880
 A seagull apparently is a nonsense term.

00:41:56.880 --> 00:42:00.440
 Her warning to birdwatchers is, and I'm repeating it now,

00:42:00.440 --> 00:42:03.840
 that it can put people off if as soon as you casually

00:42:03.840 --> 00:42:05.680
 mention a seagull in conversation, someone says,

00:42:05.680 --> 00:42:07.280
 "Well actually there's no such thing as a seagull,

00:42:07.280 --> 00:42:08.860
 "so you're not making any sense."

00:42:08.860 --> 00:42:09.860
 (audience laughing)

00:42:09.860 --> 00:42:14.860
 And that's the official word of the birdwatching society.

00:42:14.860 --> 00:42:17.740
 - But that's my life with you three.

00:42:17.740 --> 00:42:20.700
 (audience laughing)

00:42:20.700 --> 00:42:21.980
 - Yeah, sorry about that.

00:42:21.980 --> 00:42:25.140
 But yeah, birdwatchers, they're a pedantic breed,

00:42:25.140 --> 00:42:26.240
 they can be.

00:42:26.240 --> 00:42:28.380
 And just to clarify, yeah, a Canadian goose

00:42:28.380 --> 00:42:31.520
 should be a Canada goose, and gulls,

00:42:31.520 --> 00:42:34.160
 lots of different, 11 different types of gull in the UK.

00:42:34.160 --> 00:42:36.720
 And there is actually a Twitter account

00:42:36.720 --> 00:42:39.520
 called @NoSuchGull, which is about,

00:42:39.520 --> 00:42:41.800
 and the name is NoSuchThingAsAGull.

00:42:41.800 --> 00:42:45.400
 And it's kind of about how seagulls don't exist.

00:42:45.400 --> 00:42:47.120
 And so I don't really wanna slag off people

00:42:47.120 --> 00:42:48.000
 who are really pedantic about it

00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:49.320
 'cause they do actually follow QI

00:42:49.320 --> 00:42:51.000
 and retweeted us very recently.

00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:52.120
 In fact, yesterday.

00:42:52.120 --> 00:42:54.240
 - I think the most fascinating thing about that fact is,

00:42:54.240 --> 00:42:55.800
 you were on Twitter.

00:42:55.800 --> 00:42:56.800
 (audience laughing)

00:42:56.800 --> 00:42:58.560
 - Yeah.

00:42:58.560 --> 00:43:00.480
 - I only go on for birdwatching updates.

00:43:00.480 --> 00:43:02.120
 (audience laughing)

00:43:02.120 --> 00:43:03.960
 - I can be hard though, being a birdwatcher.

00:43:03.960 --> 00:43:05.640
 I think we should cut them some slack.

00:43:05.640 --> 00:43:09.640
 In 2013, they found this amazing rare bird

00:43:09.640 --> 00:43:10.800
 on the island of Harris.

00:43:10.800 --> 00:43:13.040
 It was a white-throated needle tail.

00:43:13.040 --> 00:43:16.240
 Normally you'd only find it in Asia or in Australia,

00:43:16.240 --> 00:43:17.620
 but it was on the island of Harris,

00:43:17.620 --> 00:43:20.520
 probably got caught on a draft of wind or something.

00:43:20.520 --> 00:43:23.200
 And so everyone suddenly got a message on their phones

00:43:23.200 --> 00:43:24.560
 or on their Twitter account saying,

00:43:24.560 --> 00:43:28.360
 "Guys, there is a white-throated needle tail on Harris."

00:43:28.360 --> 00:43:31.320
 And loads of people went up there to the island

00:43:31.320 --> 00:43:34.100
 all the way up in the north of Scotland to see this bird,

00:43:34.100 --> 00:43:37.280
 which was then hit by a wind turd behind me.

00:43:37.280 --> 00:43:38.280
 - No.

00:43:38.280 --> 00:43:40.720
 - In front of all these birdwatchers.

00:43:40.720 --> 00:43:42.440
 - Oh.

00:43:42.440 --> 00:43:43.280
 - That's what it was going.

00:43:43.280 --> 00:43:45.080
 I've got an amazing updraft here.

00:43:45.080 --> 00:43:45.920
 Wow.

00:43:45.920 --> 00:43:48.280
 (audience laughing)

00:43:48.280 --> 00:43:49.120
 - It does happen, doesn't it?

00:43:49.120 --> 00:43:51.080
 I think there was a story that someone,

00:43:51.080 --> 00:43:52.520
 is it a pharaoh lope?

00:43:52.520 --> 00:43:53.680
 There's a bird called a pharaoh lope, I think.

00:43:53.680 --> 00:43:54.640
 Does anyone know?

00:43:54.640 --> 00:43:56.860
 - Actually, it's a pharaoh lope.

00:43:56.860 --> 00:43:58.480
 - I think it was something like a gray pharaoh lope,

00:43:58.480 --> 00:44:00.000
 and I'm going off memory, so I really can't remember it,

00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:01.920
 but it was, these birdwatchers had got to it,

00:44:01.920 --> 00:44:03.160
 and they were so excited about seeing it,

00:44:03.160 --> 00:44:05.080
 very rare in the area where they were,

00:44:05.080 --> 00:44:09.320
 and then they saw a buzzard just arrive and land and eat it

00:44:09.320 --> 00:44:10.360
 right in front of them.

00:44:10.360 --> 00:44:12.360
 But then they did say, although the buzzards actually,

00:44:12.360 --> 00:44:13.880
 they're very rarely feed on that kind of prey,

00:44:13.880 --> 00:44:16.480
 so it kind of two birds with one stone, to be honest.

00:44:16.480 --> 00:44:17.320
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:44:17.320 --> 00:44:19.800
 - They used that phrase, they used that phrase genuinely, yeah.

00:44:19.800 --> 00:44:21.800
 - Well, they're funny guys.

00:44:21.800 --> 00:44:24.560
 - Have you heard of other birdwatching slang?

00:44:24.560 --> 00:44:27.440
 This gets used in the birdwatching community.

00:44:27.440 --> 00:44:30.200
 Do you want to have a guess at what a not a bird is?

00:44:30.200 --> 00:44:31.480
 - Is it something that's not a bird?

00:44:31.480 --> 00:44:33.160
 - Something that's not a bird.

00:44:33.160 --> 00:44:35.160
 It's something that looks like a bird from a distance,

00:44:35.160 --> 00:44:37.400
 but once binoculars or a spotting scope is used,

00:44:37.400 --> 00:44:39.240
 turns out not to be a bird.

00:44:39.240 --> 00:44:41.880
 - Is it something that's either a plane or Superman?

00:44:41.880 --> 00:44:42.720
 - That's right.

00:44:42.720 --> 00:44:45.520
 (audience laughing)

00:44:45.520 --> 00:44:47.000
 - Have you heard of a pseudo bird?

00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:49.480
 - Sudo bird sounds like it's also a not a bird.

00:44:49.480 --> 00:44:51.560
 - Well, a pseudo bird is something that looks like a bird,

00:44:51.560 --> 00:44:53.800
 and perhaps even moves like a bird,

00:44:53.800 --> 00:44:56.880
 until it is examined through binoculars or a spotting scope

00:44:56.880 --> 00:44:59.040
 and found to be something completely different.

00:44:59.040 --> 00:45:00.160
 (audience laughing)

00:45:00.160 --> 00:45:02.680
 - What is an example of a pseudo bird?

00:45:02.680 --> 00:45:03.840
 - Like a bag of crisps.

00:45:03.840 --> 00:45:05.040
 - Bag of crisps.

00:45:05.040 --> 00:45:05.880
 - Very good.

00:45:05.880 --> 00:45:06.720
 - Wow, very good.

00:45:06.720 --> 00:45:08.200
 - You know, in the corner of the tree.

00:45:08.200 --> 00:45:10.040
 - This very much feels like sort of class one

00:45:10.040 --> 00:45:11.040
 of all anthology, doesn't it?

00:45:11.040 --> 00:45:12.440
 (audience laughing)

00:45:12.440 --> 00:45:14.440
 Are you struggling to identify a bird?

00:45:14.440 --> 00:45:15.280
 - Yeah.

00:45:15.280 --> 00:45:16.120
 (audience laughing)

00:45:16.120 --> 00:45:19.240
 Do you know what more slang, do you know what jizz is in it?

00:45:19.240 --> 00:45:20.600
 - Yes, let's move on.

00:45:20.600 --> 00:45:22.640
 - I see you read my blog then.

00:45:22.640 --> 00:45:25.640
 (audience laughing)

00:45:25.640 --> 00:45:30.240
 - Jizz is the sort of,

00:45:30.240 --> 00:45:32.400
 when you can't quite see what the bird is,

00:45:32.400 --> 00:45:35.440
 and you talk about the vibe of the bird,

00:45:35.440 --> 00:45:36.720
 like it's giving off this vibe,

00:45:36.720 --> 00:45:38.640
 so it must be this kind of bird.

00:45:38.640 --> 00:45:40.840
 - So it kind of, it moves a bit like a black bird,

00:45:40.840 --> 00:45:42.440
 and it's kind of blackish,

00:45:42.440 --> 00:45:44.720
 and you think that probably is a black bird?

00:45:44.720 --> 00:45:45.560
 Is that what it is?

00:45:45.560 --> 00:45:46.400
 - I think so, yes.

00:45:46.400 --> 00:45:48.040
 - It's basically the whole demeanour, isn't it, jizz?

00:45:48.040 --> 00:45:50.480
 That bird's jizz is, well, it's tall, it's fat,

00:45:50.480 --> 00:45:51.760
 it's brown, it's--

00:45:51.760 --> 00:45:53.360
 - Wow, what is this bird?

00:45:53.360 --> 00:45:54.840
 - It's tall, it's fat, it's yellow,

00:45:54.840 --> 00:45:56.040
 I'm watching Sesame Street.

00:45:56.040 --> 00:45:59.040
 (audience laughing)

00:45:59.040 --> 00:46:03.280
 - It's been in use for a long time, though.

00:46:03.280 --> 00:46:06.560
 I think it even predates jizz as we know it today,

00:46:06.560 --> 00:46:08.960
 but there are rumors that it stands

00:46:08.960 --> 00:46:10.760
 for general impression, size, and shape,

00:46:10.760 --> 00:46:12.760
 which was a military term in the Second World War,

00:46:12.760 --> 00:46:15.720
 but it actually comes from before that, from 1922,

00:46:15.720 --> 00:46:18.560
 and it now is spread to, like, all biologists,

00:46:18.560 --> 00:46:20.800
 you'll talk about plants jizz as well, which is--

00:46:20.800 --> 00:46:23.120
 - I like one etymology, I don't know if this is true either,

00:46:23.120 --> 00:46:25.120
 but people say it just is.

00:46:25.120 --> 00:46:26.200
 What is that bird?

00:46:26.200 --> 00:46:28.600
 Oh, it just, it just is, jizz.

00:46:28.600 --> 00:46:30.040
 - Feels to me like it comes from jist.

00:46:30.040 --> 00:46:30.880
 Hey, what's the jist?

00:46:30.880 --> 00:46:33.080
 - Jist, yeah, that's better, isn't it?

00:46:33.080 --> 00:46:36.000
 - Do you know what gripping someone off is in birdwatching?

00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:39.000
 (audience laughing)

00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:41.960
 - Well, it can get very exciting.

00:46:41.960 --> 00:46:44.920
 - You've got to do something to pass to the air as well,

00:46:44.920 --> 00:46:46.840
 waiting for the white-tailed needle thing,

00:46:46.840 --> 00:46:50.440
 but gripping someone off is a bad thing to do

00:46:50.440 --> 00:46:52.800
 in birdwatching, it's where you see a bird

00:46:52.800 --> 00:46:54.520
 that someone else has missed out on,

00:46:54.520 --> 00:46:57.320
 and then you tell them about the bird that you've seen.

00:46:57.320 --> 00:46:59.240
 So you'll sort of bragging to them,

00:46:59.240 --> 00:47:00.680
 and you know that they've missed the opportunity

00:47:00.680 --> 00:47:01.520
 to see this bird.

00:47:01.520 --> 00:47:02.360
 - Oh, really?

00:47:02.360 --> 00:47:04.320
 - Yeah, yeah, and if someone's not noticed it,

00:47:04.320 --> 00:47:06.080
 maybe they were looking at it in the wrong place,

00:47:06.080 --> 00:47:08.240
 or whatever, so that's a bad thing to do.

00:47:08.240 --> 00:47:10.880
 Don't grip off if you do go birdwatching.

00:47:10.880 --> 00:47:12.520
 - So you're just not allowed to share?

00:47:12.520 --> 00:47:14.040
 If you see something cool, you're not allowed to,

00:47:14.040 --> 00:47:15.120
 you have to keep it secret in case

00:47:15.120 --> 00:47:16.360
 someone gets upset they didn't see it.

00:47:16.360 --> 00:47:17.960
 You're supposed to share,

00:47:17.960 --> 00:47:20.840
 but some asshole birdwatchers grip people off,

00:47:20.840 --> 00:47:23.440
 and they're like, oh yeah, I saw it last week,

00:47:23.440 --> 00:47:24.280
 you're too late.

00:47:24.280 --> 00:47:25.760
 I could have told you, but I didn't.

00:47:25.760 --> 00:47:27.280
 - Yeah, right.

00:47:27.280 --> 00:47:29.520
 - Just as it's disappearing down the buzzard's gullet,

00:47:29.520 --> 00:47:34.040
 you say, I've just seen a farolope, or whatever, yeah.

00:47:34.040 --> 00:47:36.560
 - This fact was about the Audubon Society, right?

00:47:36.560 --> 00:47:39.440
 The Bird Society, and he actually is an incredible

00:47:39.440 --> 00:47:42.120
 character from history, who was the first person

00:47:42.120 --> 00:47:45.520
 to put together a sort of great collection of paintings

00:47:45.520 --> 00:47:48.560
 published in a book of the birds of America,

00:47:48.560 --> 00:47:51.080
 and it's one of those rare books now

00:47:51.080 --> 00:47:53.280
 that it basically outsells any book

00:47:53.280 --> 00:47:55.160
 in terms of price value at an auction,

00:47:55.160 --> 00:47:59.120
 so a copy went a while ago for about 11 million,

00:47:59.120 --> 00:48:00.240
 11 million.

00:48:00.240 --> 00:48:01.080
 - Yeah, it's--

00:48:01.080 --> 00:48:02.720
 - We've got one in our house, no.

00:48:02.720 --> 00:48:03.760
 - An original?

00:48:03.760 --> 00:48:05.440
 - Oh, I don't know, okay, so it's not all of them

00:48:05.440 --> 00:48:06.280
 going for that.

00:48:06.280 --> 00:48:08.600
 (audience laughs)

00:48:08.600 --> 00:48:11.640
 - No, your Kindle PDF is not gonna be sold at Sotheby's.

00:48:11.640 --> 00:48:15.040
 Have you noticed that every branch of Waterstones

00:48:15.040 --> 00:48:17.480
 has a massive safe in the middle of the shop floor?

00:48:17.480 --> 00:48:18.920
 That's where they keep that book.

00:48:18.920 --> 00:48:19.880
 - Yes.

00:48:19.880 --> 00:48:21.160
 - I was just close to starting up

00:48:21.160 --> 00:48:23.720
 and walking off the podcast, never to return.

00:48:23.720 --> 00:48:24.880
 - Fuck you, guys!

00:48:24.880 --> 00:48:27.800
 (audience laughs)

00:48:27.800 --> 00:48:28.640
 - Bye.

00:48:28.640 --> 00:48:32.760
 Sorry, so some versions are very expensive, yeah?

00:48:32.760 --> 00:48:34.320
 - Yeah, so it's an amazing book,

00:48:34.320 --> 00:48:35.720
 and he used to paint these birds,

00:48:35.720 --> 00:48:39.440
 and it used to be a bit more of a vicious bird spotting thing.

00:48:39.440 --> 00:48:41.360
 These days, the idea, I think, of hurting a bird

00:48:41.360 --> 00:48:44.040
 in any way would be horrible back then,

00:48:44.040 --> 00:48:45.640
 in order to paint the bird and spot them,

00:48:45.640 --> 00:48:46.720
 you actually had to kill them,

00:48:46.720 --> 00:48:49.480
 so he used to go around and he would shoot birds,

00:48:49.480 --> 00:48:51.160
 and then what he would do is he would put

00:48:51.160 --> 00:48:53.280
 sort of wires onto them and pose them

00:48:53.280 --> 00:48:56.120
 as if they were mid-flight so that he could capture them

00:48:56.120 --> 00:48:58.560
 as if they were in the nature and they were alive,

00:48:58.560 --> 00:49:00.160
 which is very different to any kind of drawing

00:49:00.160 --> 00:49:02.920
 at that time, it was usually very posed and very still.

00:49:02.920 --> 00:49:04.840
 So he kind of, he did that brilliantly,

00:49:04.840 --> 00:49:06.640
 but the other amazing thing is this book,

00:49:06.640 --> 00:49:08.680
 the original book, how tall is your book?

00:49:08.680 --> 00:49:10.160
 - It's about this big, it's big.

00:49:10.160 --> 00:49:11.760
 - It's a big book, and the original,

00:49:11.760 --> 00:49:13.640
 the idea was he wanted to capture the birds

00:49:13.640 --> 00:49:15.560
 in their full size, so when you saw it,

00:49:15.560 --> 00:49:18.120
 it was almost as if you were in front of one.

00:49:18.120 --> 00:49:19.440
 Yeah, but what's really wonderful is

00:49:19.440 --> 00:49:22.120
 he slightly miscalculated the size of some of the birds,

00:49:22.120 --> 00:49:24.200
 so in some of them, they've had to be contorted

00:49:24.200 --> 00:49:29.200
 to sort of fit to the page, like squish down with wings.

00:49:29.200 --> 00:49:31.880
 Yeah, but yeah, really fascinating character.

00:49:31.880 --> 00:49:33.680
 - He was, do you know how he made his living

00:49:33.680 --> 00:49:36.400
 before he got into the bird drawing business?

00:49:36.400 --> 00:49:37.840
 Or in fact, as like, you know,

00:49:37.840 --> 00:49:39.200
 while he was drawing birds as a hobby,

00:49:39.200 --> 00:49:41.480
 he made his money as a death bed artist,

00:49:41.480 --> 00:49:45.000
 so that's someone who, if someone you love dies,

00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:47.600
 you go, oh my God, we forgot to get a portrait of them,

00:49:47.600 --> 00:49:49.320
 we'd better get one now, and you went

00:49:49.320 --> 00:49:51.000
 and you would paint a portrait of a dead person

00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:54.080
 of the corpse, and it would be lying in repose

00:49:54.080 --> 00:49:56.440
 with maybe a bunch of flowers or photograph or something.

00:49:56.440 --> 00:49:59.000
 - But would he pose them like he later did the birds,

00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:01.040
 as in with wires and with--

00:50:01.040 --> 00:50:05.240
 - Absolutely, yeah, doing the high jump or backflip.

00:50:05.240 --> 00:50:06.560
 However you wanted it.

00:50:08.480 --> 00:50:11.800
 - Have you guys heard of Phoebe Snetsinger?

00:50:11.800 --> 00:50:13.120
 Phoebe Snetsinger's amazing.

00:50:13.120 --> 00:50:18.040
 So she, in 1981, was diagnosed with terminal cancer

00:50:18.040 --> 00:50:20.960
 and decided that instead of going into a home

00:50:20.960 --> 00:50:22.800
 and just kind of succumbing to it,

00:50:22.800 --> 00:50:25.160
 she decided, well, I've not got much time left,

00:50:25.160 --> 00:50:26.920
 so I'm gonna go and look for birds.

00:50:26.920 --> 00:50:30.040
 Okay, and she took a trip to Alaska to look for birds,

00:50:30.040 --> 00:50:32.400
 and she kept looking for birds and kept looking for birds,

00:50:32.400 --> 00:50:34.760
 and luckily enough got into remission

00:50:34.760 --> 00:50:36.160
 and kept looking for birds,

00:50:36.160 --> 00:50:37.680
 and she was the first person to see

00:50:37.680 --> 00:50:41.040
 more than 8,000 species of birds ever,

00:50:41.040 --> 00:50:43.120
 and when she died, eventually,

00:50:43.120 --> 00:50:46.400
 she'd seen 8,398 birds,

00:50:46.400 --> 00:50:51.200
 which was 85% of the known species in the world she'd seen.

00:50:51.200 --> 00:50:52.040
 Isn't that amazing?

00:50:52.040 --> 00:50:52.880
 - Wow!

00:50:52.880 --> 00:50:54.200
 - So good.

00:50:54.200 --> 00:50:56.440
 We're gonna have to wrap up soon, guys.

00:50:56.440 --> 00:50:58.880
 Yeah, no, we are, but we are.

00:50:58.880 --> 00:50:59.760
 - No, yes.

00:50:59.760 --> 00:51:02.800
 - But I haven't told you about Graham Moss yet.

00:51:02.800 --> 00:51:03.640
 - Right.

00:51:03.640 --> 00:51:04.760
 - You've hooked me, go for it.

00:51:04.760 --> 00:51:06.000
 (audience laughing)

00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:07.880
 - This is a bird watching story from this year,

00:51:07.880 --> 00:51:09.680
 and it's just a rather nice one.

00:51:09.680 --> 00:51:11.720
 It's Doncaster Baby Owl webcam,

00:51:11.720 --> 00:51:15.160
 banned by Facebook over sex and nudity rule.

00:51:15.160 --> 00:51:20.160
 So, this summer, a man in Doncaster called Graham Moss,

00:51:20.160 --> 00:51:22.880
 he set up a very sweet webcam of some baby owls

00:51:22.880 --> 00:51:23.920
 in their nest, and just--

00:51:23.920 --> 00:51:25.600
 - So were you looking at Moss News?

00:51:25.600 --> 00:51:26.680
 - You were, weren't you?

00:51:26.680 --> 00:51:29.120
 (audience laughing)

00:51:29.120 --> 00:51:30.280
 - This is a complete coincidence,

00:51:30.280 --> 00:51:31.560
 although there is a book about bird watching

00:51:31.560 --> 00:51:33.080
 by someone called Stephen Moss.

00:51:33.080 --> 00:51:34.640
 - All right, you've been looking at Moss News.

00:51:34.640 --> 00:51:36.880
 - And fortunately, it's coincided with the research

00:51:36.880 --> 00:51:38.560
 for today, but you got lucky.

00:51:38.560 --> 00:51:41.040
 - But it got, his webcam was taken down twice

00:51:41.040 --> 00:51:42.800
 'cause it breached the community guidelines

00:51:42.800 --> 00:51:45.440
 on adult nudity and sexual activity.

00:51:45.440 --> 00:51:46.400
 - But what was happening?

00:51:46.400 --> 00:51:47.220
 - Nothing, nothing was happening.

00:51:47.220 --> 00:51:50.560
 It was just some baby owls, but either algorithmically,

00:51:50.560 --> 00:51:51.400
 it saw the sort of--

00:51:51.400 --> 00:51:52.320
 - Algorithmically?

00:51:52.320 --> 00:51:54.360
 - There we go.

00:51:54.360 --> 00:51:56.200
 (audience laughing)

00:51:56.200 --> 00:51:58.360
 - No one's seeing this outside the street, but I--

00:51:58.360 --> 00:52:00.320
 (audience laughing)

00:52:00.320 --> 00:52:02.080
 - But yeah, it always thinks he was pranked,

00:52:02.080 --> 00:52:04.160
 but I think it's possible that algorithmically,

00:52:04.160 --> 00:52:07.600
 someone would see some sort of writhing flesh in a nest.

00:52:07.600 --> 00:52:09.480
 - You think that looks rude?

00:52:09.480 --> 00:52:10.760
 - Were they featherless?

00:52:10.760 --> 00:52:11.600
 - Were they naked?

00:52:11.600 --> 00:52:12.440
 - Well, they were baby owls,

00:52:12.440 --> 00:52:14.560
 so I think they probably would have been very feathered.

00:52:14.560 --> 00:52:16.880
 - Yeah, you can get in trouble with things like that.

00:52:16.880 --> 00:52:20.840
 The Christmas Island tourist board went onto Facebook

00:52:20.840 --> 00:52:24.000
 to advertise the island's annual Burden Nature Week

00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:26.360
 with the headline, "Some gorgeous shots here

00:52:26.360 --> 00:52:28.480
 "of some juvenile boobies."

00:52:28.480 --> 00:52:29.880
 - Oh, fuck.

00:52:29.880 --> 00:52:30.720
 - No.

00:52:30.720 --> 00:52:33.280
 - And Facebook, for some reason, took them down.

00:52:33.280 --> 00:52:35.320
 (audience laughing)

00:52:35.320 --> 00:52:37.520
 And they appealed to Facebook, saying,

00:52:37.520 --> 00:52:38.680
 "Charlie, some mistake.

00:52:38.680 --> 00:52:40.040
 "We're just talking about this bird,

00:52:40.040 --> 00:52:42.560
 "which is called a boobie," and Facebook went, "Nope."

00:52:42.560 --> 00:52:43.880
 (audience laughing)

00:52:43.880 --> 00:52:44.840
 - That's kind of fair.

00:52:44.840 --> 00:52:47.840
 - I read there was an interview, Birdwatch Ireland,

00:52:47.840 --> 00:52:50.200
 there was a member called Niall Hatch,

00:52:50.200 --> 00:52:53.800
 and the person interviewing just got so excited

00:52:53.800 --> 00:52:54.840
 that he was called Hatch,

00:52:54.840 --> 00:52:57.360
 that he derailed the conversation in order to say,

00:52:57.360 --> 00:52:58.640
 "Oh, that's funny, isn't it?"

00:52:58.640 --> 00:53:01.080
 And then he turned out, he said,

00:53:01.080 --> 00:53:03.360
 "It's actually not as sort of uncommon

00:53:03.360 --> 00:53:05.600
 "to have a bird-related name for members

00:53:05.600 --> 00:53:07.240
 "of the Birdwatch Ireland.

00:53:07.240 --> 00:53:08.720
 "It's a bit more common."

00:53:08.720 --> 00:53:10.360
 So he then listed off a bunch of people

00:53:10.360 --> 00:53:12.800
 that were past and present people as part of it.

00:53:12.800 --> 00:53:15.160
 So we had Donald Finch,

00:53:15.160 --> 00:53:18.680
 Ashlyn Tallinn, Steven Wing, Dave Bird.

00:53:18.680 --> 00:53:19.880
 (audience laughing)

00:53:19.880 --> 00:53:21.320
 Bit on the nose, Dave.

00:53:21.320 --> 00:53:23.080
 (audience laughing)

00:53:23.080 --> 00:53:25.720
 - That is so a fake name, isn't it?

00:53:25.720 --> 00:53:26.920
 (audience laughing)

00:53:26.920 --> 00:53:27.840
 - Look at Ms. Tallinn over here.

00:53:27.840 --> 00:53:29.440
 She's picked a part of the bird.

00:53:29.440 --> 00:53:30.760
 (audience laughing)

00:53:30.760 --> 00:53:31.600
 - Dave Bird.

00:53:31.600 --> 00:53:32.920
 - Dave Bird.

00:53:32.920 --> 00:53:33.760
 - Yeah.

00:53:33.760 --> 00:53:34.600
 - Anyone else?

00:53:34.600 --> 00:53:36.360
 - There's Mark Robbins.

00:53:36.360 --> 00:53:38.880
 - See, Mark's picked a species of bird.

00:53:38.880 --> 00:53:40.320
 Not like you, Dave.

00:53:40.320 --> 00:53:42.720
 - Olivia Crow.

00:53:42.720 --> 00:53:43.560
 - And yeah.

00:53:43.560 --> 00:53:45.560
 - Mark, do you think sometimes people

00:53:45.560 --> 00:53:48.240
 in Birdwatching societies go, "Mark, Robbins."

00:53:48.240 --> 00:53:49.160
 (audience laughing)

00:53:49.160 --> 00:53:50.680
 Just saying, "Look, Robbins."

00:53:50.680 --> 00:53:52.480
 - Do you think they go, "Dave, bird?"

00:53:52.480 --> 00:53:55.640
 (audience laughing)

00:53:55.640 --> 00:53:56.640
 - I've got one last thing.

00:53:56.640 --> 00:53:59.520
 Just on the subject of being pedantic and bird-splaining,

00:53:59.520 --> 00:54:02.760
 we've actually had, I've been sent a WhatsApp message

00:54:02.760 --> 00:54:05.920
 by Alex Bell, who is one of the fish team.

00:54:05.920 --> 00:54:07.640
 He just wants me to pass this on to Anna.

00:54:07.640 --> 00:54:11.040
 Anna's Gull Twitter thing is @NoSuchSeagull,

00:54:11.040 --> 00:54:13.200
 not @NoSuchGulls.

00:54:13.200 --> 00:54:15.040
 (audience laughing)

00:54:15.040 --> 00:54:17.360
 - And I think we now know who runs that account.

00:54:17.360 --> 00:54:20.360
 (audience laughing)

00:54:20.360 --> 00:54:22.680
 - Okay, that's it.

00:54:22.680 --> 00:54:23.920
 That is all of our facts.

00:54:23.920 --> 00:54:25.480
 Thank you so much for listening.

00:54:25.480 --> 00:54:27.360

00:55:05.880 --> 00:55:08.600
 We have all of our previous episodes up there.

00:55:08.600 --> 00:55:10.320
 So just quickly before we end,

00:55:10.320 --> 00:55:12.680
 just a huge thank you to the London Podcast Festival

00:55:12.680 --> 00:55:13.720
 and to King's Place.

00:55:13.720 --> 00:55:16.000
 It's truly awesome that the arts are trying

00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:18.720
 to get through this and we feel so lucky

00:55:18.720 --> 00:55:20.320
 to be able to do this in front of you guys today.

00:55:20.320 --> 00:55:21.360
 And I hope you had a fun time.

00:55:21.360 --> 00:55:22.840
 And so that's it.

00:55:22.840 --> 00:55:24.020
 We'll be back again next week.

00:55:24.020 --> 00:55:24.840
 We'll see you then.

00:55:24.840 --> 00:55:25.680
 Goodbye!

00:55:25.680 --> 00:55:28.260
 (upbeat music)

00:55:28.620 --> 00:55:31.780
 (audience applauding)

00:55:31.780 --> 00:55:34.360
 (upbeat music)

00:55:34.360 --> 00:55:37.520
 (audience applauding)

00:55:37.520 --> 00:55:40.100
 (upbeat music)
