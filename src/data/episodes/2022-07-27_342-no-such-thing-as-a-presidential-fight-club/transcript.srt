00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,940
 Hey everyone, welcome to this week's episode of Fish.

2
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:04,420
 I just want to let you know that the episode

3
00:00:04,420 --> 00:00:06,440
 you're about to listen to was recorded live

4
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:09,460
 at the London Podcast Festival at King's Place

5
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:12,800
 and that it was recorded just a few weeks ago.

6
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:15,120
 That's right, we actually managed to do a live gig

7
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:16,800
 in the year 2020.

8
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,240
 It was such a fun night.

9
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,200
 It was actually the first time that the four of us

10
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:21,200
 had been in a room together

11
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:22,960
 since this whole pandemic kicked off.

12
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:24,400
 It's about seven months.

13
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:25,680
 So that was incredibly fun.

14
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,880
 It was amazing to see some of the fish listeners

15
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:29,120
 sitting out there in the audience,

16
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:31,120
 all sitting there with their masks on,

17
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:32,880
 spread out around the auditorium

18
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,720
 so that we could make sure everyone was nicely,

19
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:36,760
 socially distanced from each other.

20
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:38,780
 And so big thank you to them.

21
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:40,420
 Big thank you to everyone who joined us online

22
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:41,920
 to watch it as it streamed.

23
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:44,640
 It was our first ever global gig as a result.

24
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,320
 And most importantly, a big thank you

25
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:47,600
 to the staff at King's Place

26
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:51,400
 who made sure everyone felt safe going ahead with this gig.

27
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:52,920
 So yeah, we hope you enjoy it.

28
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:54,480
 It's our first gig of the year,

29
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,480
 possibly our last, hopefully not.

30
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:00,360
 But here it is, live in London in the year 2020.

31
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:01,200
 Enjoy.

32
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:18,360
 Hello and welcome to another episode

33
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:19,760
 of No Such Thing as a Fish,

34
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:22,320
 a weekly podcast this week coming to you live

35
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,520
 from the London Podcast Festival.

36
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:27,520
 (audience cheering)

37
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:34,640
 My name is Dan Shriver.

38
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:37,000
 I'm sitting here with Anna Tachinsky,

39
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,360
 Andrew Hunter Murray and James Harkin.

40
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,520
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones

41
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:44,240
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days.

42
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:47,440
 And in no particular order, here we go.

43
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:49,120
 Starting with my fact this week,

44
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:51,560
 my fact is that Theodore Roosevelt

45
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:54,800
 once was shot in the chest but survived

46
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:58,720
 thanks to a 50 page long speech tucked into his coat pocket.

47
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:01,080
 He delivered the speech reading from pages

48
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:04,080
 that now had two massive bullet holes in them.

49
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:06,360
 Wow.

50
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:09,760
 And he did a speech which lasted about 90 minutes.

51
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:10,600
 Wow.

52
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,960
 And that's where the idea of bullet points came from,

53
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:13,800
 isn't it?

54
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:17,560
 Come on, it's been seven months.

55
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:20,200
 (audience cheering)

56
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,880
 Yeah, this happened in 1912.

57
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:23,040
 He was in Milwaukee.

58
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,040
 He was on his way to the Milwaukee Auditorium

59
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:27,040
 and he was in an open top car.

60
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,720
 And as he was standing up to wave,

61
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,720
 a gunman who was called John Shrank

62
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:33,600
 shot him in the chest, basically at point blank range.

63
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:36,080
 And the bullet still went into his body

64
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,000
 and was lodged inside his body.

65
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,400
 But rather than go to the hospital,

66
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,880
 he said, "I'll just quickly do my 90 minute speech."

67
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:44,440
 And you can actually see if you go online,

68
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:47,000
 they have in a museum the pages of this speech.

69
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,360
 And when I say massive bullet holes,

70
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:51,160
 they are ginormous, these two ginormous bullet holes.

71
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,760
 But yeah, he was a badass like that.

72
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:54,600
 He was a badass, like, to make sure

73
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,360
 that it hadn't penetrated his lungs,

74
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:58,720
 he coughed into his hand three times

75
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,720
 and checked for blood to make sure

76
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,120
 that he didn't have to go to hospital.

77
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,640
 That's pretty hard car, isn't it?

78
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:06,280
 All of his aides were sort of standing around

79
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,640
 'cause they were quite nervous about this.

80
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:09,000
 They thought he should go to hospital.

81
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,480
 Lots of the crowd, he announced right at the start,

82
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:13,280
 he said, "Friends, I should ask you to be

83
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,280
 "as quiet as possible.

84
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,920
 "I don't know whether you fully understand

85
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,560
 "that I have just been shot."

86
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:19,240
 And so people were standing around,

87
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,200
 it's sort of ready to catch him

88
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,240
 at the side of the stage, basically.

89
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,800
 And he kept glaring at them

90
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,000
 and he refused to even cut it short.

91
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,760
 - Did he not have to miss out the odd word

92
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,640
 that the bullet holes had gone through?

93
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,720
 - Oh, yeah.

94
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:32,040
 - It actually didn't make any sense at all, the speech.

95
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:34,320
 - Yeah, it kind of came out as like a redacted speech

96
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:36,280
 that he wasn't giving us all the info on.

97
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,240
 - Did you guys see this?

98
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:39,120
 This allegedly happened when he announced,

99
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,920
 by the way, I've just been shot right at the top

100
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:43,320
 before he got into the actual stuff that was on his pages.

101
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,760
 Apparently, when he said that,

102
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:46,920
 someone in the crowd shouted, "Fake."

103
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:48,920
 (laughing)

104
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:52,160
 - Well, I didn't know Donald Trump was alive back then.

105
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,640
 - Supposedly, he stepped forward and said,

106
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:56,240
 "No, no, it's real, here's my beanie shirt."

107
00:03:56,240 --> 00:04:00,120
 - The guy had to come up and put his finger in the hole to me, too.

108
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,640
 - They left the bullet in, didn't they?

109
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:02,760
 Forever and ever, I think,

110
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:04,440
 'cause it was too dangerous to extract it,

111
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:06,480
 so just kept it in forever.

112
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,120
 But he sent a telegram to his wife,

113
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,600
 I think, straight after giving the speech,

114
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,880
 he dictated a telegram to her

115
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,800
 when he was on his way to hospital saying,

116
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:15,720
 "He was in excellent shape and he just had a little injury,

117
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:17,560
 "no more serious than one of the trivial injuries

118
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,320
 "that kids were always getting."

119
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:21,520
 (laughing)

120
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:25,720
 Their children were neglected is what I've read into that.

121
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,840
 It is one of those things that makes you understand

122
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,240
 why there are generations who say,

123
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:31,280
 "Oh, they don't make the might they used to."

124
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:34,960
 You can't imagine the, you know, us snowflakes standing there

125
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,440
 and delivering a 90-minute podcast

126
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:37,960
 with bullet holes through our chests.

127
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:41,240
 I wouldn't do it, I'm not gonna lie.

128
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,080
 - Yeah, it's very weird.

129
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,920
 I mean, what was interesting about him was,

130
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:46,640
 he was very much into physical exertion.

131
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:48,640
 He was in pushing his body all the time

132
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:49,880
 to sort of be the strongest he can be.

133
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:52,520
 There's accounts of him where he would hang a wire

134
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:54,920
 over a river and it would be a fast flowing,

135
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,480
 very dangerous river with currents

136
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:58,480
 and he would just hang on the rope

137
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:00,720
 just to bring his body strength better.

138
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,400
 But like the risk of if he'd fallen into the water

139
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,880
 would be possible drowning

140
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,920
 and he was just like always on the edge.

141
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:09,080
 - Well, do you know that's because he was brought up that way.

142
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:12,640
 His parents were something called muscular Christians.

143
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:13,480
 - What?

144
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:16,640
 That sounds so cool.

145
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:19,120
 - It sounds half-cool, doesn't it?

146
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,640
 - Oh, they worship at the church

147
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:24,280
 of our blessed lady of the six pack, don't they?

148
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:26,280
 Yeah, yeah, what is a muscular Christian?

149
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:28,560
 - It's pretty much exactly what it sounds like.

150
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,520
 So the idea was to be a good Christian.

151
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:32,320
 You had to kind of look after your body

152
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,760
 and be really muscular.

153
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,640
 It was quite, I wouldn't say misogynistic,

154
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:36,800
 but it was of its time.

155
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,920
 Like it was basically men should be strong

156
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:41,040
 and they should look after the women kind of thing.

157
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:43,920
 And it was quite popular in America at the time.

158
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:46,400
 And according to Wikipedia, I read this verbatim,

159
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:49,120
 it said muscular Christianity spread to other countries

160
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,600
 in the 19th century.

161
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:54,560
 It was well-entrenched in Australian society by 1860,

162
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,440
 though not always with much recognition

163
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:57,800
 of the religious elements.

164
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:00,800
 (audience laughing)

165
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,320
 Simon, that explains quite a lot, doesn't it?

166
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:07,360
 - But he was quite a wimp initially, wasn't he, Teddy?

167
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,880
 In his childhood, he was, well, a wimp is harsh.

168
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:11,320
 He had asthma.

169
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:12,160
 So...

170
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,360
 (audience laughing)

171
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,360
 - That tells you a lot about Anna in the school yard,

172
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,200
 doesn't it?

173
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,160
 (audience laughing)

174
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:19,400
 - I had a very specific role in the playground.

175
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,200
 (audience laughing)

176
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,560
 No, he had a really difficult childhood.

177
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,280
 He had really bad asthma and he was,

178
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:26,880
 he described himself as quite sickly and quite weak.

179
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,600
 And he got beaten up as a teenager

180
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,040
 and found he couldn't defend himself.

181
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:32,960
 And so he demanded boxing lessons from his dad

182
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:35,320
 and got them and he devoted himself completely

183
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:37,560
 to becoming someone who was able to beat the bullies

184
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:38,720
 in the future. - Yeah.

185
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:39,720
 - And yeah, it was hardcore.

186
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:42,080
 There's lots of sources that say he was the first American

187
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,640
 to get a brown belt in Judo,

188
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:46,040
 which, like a lot of his biographies claim,

189
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,680
 he was certainly very good at Judo.

190
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,920
 - What's brown, definitely, is below black, right?

191
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:50,880
 - It's below black, yeah.

192
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:53,920
 - That's not, like, the greatest boast.

193
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,960
 - It's the one below black, okay?

194
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:58,040
 Just 'cause brown's a bit of a yucky color.

195
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,720
 - No, it's just, but then black just has, like,

196
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,200
 these extra, like, first and second down.

197
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,920
 Like, black goes on, it's fine.

198
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:03,760
 We'll talk later.

199
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:05,160
 - All right, Dan, you come back to me

200
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,680
 when you've got a black belt in Judo.

201
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:09,120
 - I have one in Taekwondo, I'll have you know.

202
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,080
 - Second Dan, yeah. - Oh, yeah, you do.

203
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:12,400
 - That's great.

204
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,080
 - There were two Dan's in the class with that.

205
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:17,080
 (audience laughing)

206
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:20,640
 - He, I think as well,

207
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,680
 I think he had mega anger issues as well,

208
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:25,000
 because he wouldn't let something go.

209
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,720
 There was a story that happened in 1886.

210
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,400
 We still have second Danning, is that what's going on?

211
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:33,200
 - Sorry, I'm just laughing at my own joke over here.

212
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:35,680
 (audience laughing)

213
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,840
 - So good to see you again.

214
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:38,800
 (audience laughing)

215
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:42,840
 - Yeah, so 1886, Roosevelt, his boat was stolen

216
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:45,080
 by these two thieves, and they took the boat

217
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:46,640
 and they started riding it away.

218
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:48,320
 And rather than letting it go, he was like,

219
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:51,480
 "No, I'm gonna chase them, and I'm gonna get it back."

220
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:53,200
 And he knew that they had such a head start

221
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:55,040
 that this would take days.

222
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,960
 So he was like, "Screw it, I'm doing it anyway."

223
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,080
 So he decided to do it.

224
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,520
 And this is how preparative he was.

225
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,120
 He took food that he wanted to take in pursuit.

226
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:04,760
 He also took a copy of Anna Karenina,

227
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:05,600
 because he thought, "Oh."

228
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,040
 - It's hard to protect him from the next bullet.

229
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:09,960
 (audience laughing)

230
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:11,640
 - Yeah, no, I think it was downtime

231
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:13,360
 that he was like, "Just gonna bring a bullet."

232
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,680
 - Anna Karenina, that's Tolstoy, isn't it?

233
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:15,520
 - Yeah.

234
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,360
 - Yeah, so he was effectively a cowboy

235
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,840
 for some of his pre-presidency life.

236
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,840
 And he, I think this may have been the same incident,

237
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,760
 but he was chasing outlaws.

238
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:25,920
 I don't know if he was kind of a deputy sheriff

239
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,800
 or a deputy marshal, something like that.

240
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,360
 He was chasing three outlaws at one point.

241
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,280
 He caught them.

242
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:32,520
 He then had to watch them for 40 hours

243
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:34,320
 when he was sort of bringing them in.

244
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:37,240
 And he kept himself awake by reading Tolstoy.

245
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,080
 - Yeah, that was it.

246
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,600
 He was reading and he was holding his shotgun

247
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,400
 over the kind of bad guys.

248
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:44,160
 He was reading like this. - No way.

249
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:48,280
 - And he finished Anna Karenina halfway through the 40 hours

250
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:49,960
 and he was like, "Well, what am I gonna do now?"

251
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,400
 And one of the outlaws had a book

252
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,520
 and he said, "Give me your book."

253
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:53,840
 And he started reading his book.

254
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:56,680
 - Oh, what's so funny?

255
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:58,200
 Did he read it to them?

256
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,040
 - I don't think so.

257
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,160
 - Was it like Theodore Roosevelt's

258
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,880
 lethal audio book time?

259
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:03,720
 Or was it?

260
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:06,040
 - Yeah, 'cause Anna Karenina loses her head at the end.

261
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:07,920
 Maybe he was like, "This is what's gonna happen to you."

262
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,280
 - Wow. - And spoiler.

263
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:10,840
 - I cannot let you--

264
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,560
 - If you haven't read Anna Karenina dead by then.

265
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,840
 - She loses her head, either metaphorically or literally.

266
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:18,400
 We won't specify which, but it involves a train.

267
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:22,120
 - There is no one, there is no one listening to our podcast

268
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,520
 that has not read Anna Karenina.

269
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:24,720
 - I actually can't believe you just did that.

270
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,800
 I think we've just lost all the online listeners

271
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,840
 and some people at the back have walked out.

272
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,640
 And also, I don't think she's not leaning over

273
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:31,800
 to vomit on the railway.

274
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,280
 The train doesn't knock her head off

275
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:34,360
 as far as I remember.

276
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:36,080
 It's just a full on death by train

277
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,720
 if we are really revealing the ending.

278
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:41,720
 - I think we've committed now, so yeah, go for it.

279
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:42,560
 I think it's amazing.

280
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,240
 It's a thing that's sort of not attached

281
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,760
 to 19th century outlaw folktales

282
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:49,280
 that there's always a sort of break to read a book

283
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:50,600
 during a chase.

284
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,440
 - Always carry a book.

285
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,400
 - Everyone's got a book on them.

286
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,360
 How cool is that?

287
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,200
 - It's the outlaw code.

288
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:56,280
 - Yeah, I just wonder what the outlaws book was.

289
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:57,960
 'Cause it can't have been more Tolstoy.

290
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,680
 What are the odds of them having--

291
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:00,520
 - Unlikely.

292
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:01,840
 - It's probably something really--

293
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:02,920
 - How to steal a boat.

294
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:09,080
 - He had cowboy practice actually when he was a kid.

295
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:11,240
 His parents used to stick him on a horse

296
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:12,800
 or in a carriage just behind a horse

297
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:15,040
 and make the horse gallop at breakneck speed

298
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:17,680
 as fast as it possibly could with his mouth open.

299
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,440
 Not the horse, Teddy with his mouth open.

300
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,720
 'Cause they thought that would cure his asthma.

301
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:22,560
 - No.

302
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:23,380
 - Really?

303
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:25,080
 - It doesn't feel like that would work.

304
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:25,920
 - Well.

305
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:28,680
 - Look, have you tried it?

306
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:30,240
 - I'm not a doctor.

307
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,120
 - But didn't Thomas Jefferson tried to,

308
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:34,480
 and I think thought he successfully cured his diarrhea

309
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,200
 by horseback riding.

310
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:38,400
 - That feels like that would cure your constipation

311
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:39,480
 rather than your diarrhea.

312
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,560
 - Yeah, you would think right.

313
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,440
 Yeah, but maybe it floods it out.

314
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:44,280
 - Yeah.

315
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:46,680
 - But you put asthma sufferers on the carriage behind him

316
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:48,120
 and that's two birds one stone.

317
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:51,920
 - I just love all these old horse prescriptions.

318
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,760
 Get on a horse and yeah.

319
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:56,800
 - Theodore Roosevelt kind of invented piranhas.

320
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,120
 - Wow.

321
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:03,880
 - Interesting, he, and I stand by this, so.

322
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:04,720
 - Wait, I know what's happened.

323
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,560
 Andy, you've got my notes.

324
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:07,400
 Sorry.

325
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,480
 - No, he did, he genuinely did.

326
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:11,720
 So he wrote a book, I think it was in about 1913.

327
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:13,120
 So he'd already been president by this point

328
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,160
 and he'd been shot and everything.

329
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,160
 But he was, he did lots of expeditions

330
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,560
 and big game hunting and all of this.

331
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:19,960
 He wrote this book through the Brazilian wilderness

332
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:22,120
 and in it he has this long bit describing

333
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:24,720
 these ferocious piranhas that you get in the Amazon

334
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:27,940
 and how they can strip a cow's flesh from its bones

335
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:29,200
 in a few minutes.

336
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:32,200
 And he said that they will snap a finger off a hand

337
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:34,320
 in cautiously trailed in the water.

338
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,060
 I never witnessed an exhibition

339
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:38,640
 of such impotent savage fury.

340
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,600
 So that's all, it's basically all thanks to him.

341
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:43,240
 But the reason, I mean piranhas don't do that

342
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:46,600
 unless they're really, unless it's really dry

343
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:47,840
 and they're really crammed in together

344
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:50,160
 and they're really, really hungry.

345
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,720
 Some of them are vegetarian, for example.

346
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:52,560
 But.

347
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:53,640
 (audience laughs)

348
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:55,400
 - The ethical piranhas.

349
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:57,680
 There are more and more of them.

350
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,740
 But they reckon that maybe, this is just a theory,

351
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:01,040
 that when he was visiting the area

352
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,040
 where he saw this kind of exhibition display

353
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,480
 of piranha activity, it's because his hosts

354
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:07,260
 had blocked off a bit of the river,

355
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:09,140
 chucked a load of piranhas in there,

356
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:11,460
 let it dry out, not fed them at all.

357
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:12,940
 And so by the time the Roosevelt arrived,

358
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:14,900
 they were really, really, really ready to eat.

359
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:16,500
 That's what made it like that.

360
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:18,620
 - And are you saying he invented the piranha

361
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:20,540
 because he sort of invented our idea

362
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:22,060
 of the piranha as a very vicious animal?

363
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:22,900
 - Yeah.

364
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:23,740
 - That's fair.

365
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:24,580
 - I see.

366
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:25,920
 It's half fair, yeah.

367
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,740
 (audience laughs)

368
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:28,960
 He was a tough boss.

369
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,140
 Given that he was a tough man,

370
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:32,780
 he kind of expected the same from his cabinet, for instance.

371
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:34,540
 He had this thing called the tennis cabinet,

372
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:38,280
 which was initially started as a way of him exercising

373
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:40,080
 with all his kind of younger employees.

374
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,420
 And so his younger ministers would go out

375
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:42,240
 and play tennis with him.

376
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,900
 And he thought tennis actually was really dull

377
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:46,420
 'cause he didn't really get to fight each other hand-to-hand.

378
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:51,420
 And so, what the tennis cabinet became was, every day,

379
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:54,740
 they had to get together and they picked a target on a map.

380
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:56,600
 And without checking any of the terrain,

381
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:59,560
 whether it was full of rivers or mountains or piranhas,

382
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:02,280
 they had to just walk to that target without stopping

383
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:04,240
 and without diverting from a straight course.

384
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,680
 And so they ended up doing things like,

385
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,360
 at one point, they were all made to swim

386
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,120
 through a half-frozen river.

387
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,040
 And, yeah, if you survive that.

388
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:11,880
 - When he was president.

389
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:12,720
 - Yeah. - Wow.

390
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,080
 - Yeah, it's his cabinet.

391
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,560
 Well, then he used to have these big boxing fights

392
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:16,600
 in the White House, didn't he?

393
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,880
 Where he invited professional boxers to come and fight him.

394
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,120
 - Really? (audience laughs)

395
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:21,680
 - Yeah.

396
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,280
 You were asked to come and beat up the president.

397
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:25,000
 - I imagine if the current president offered that

398
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,620
 in the White House. - I imagine the queue.

399
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:30,620
 (audience laughs)

400
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:32,060
 - We're gonna have to move on very shortly.

401
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:34,860
 - Oh, well, we have to talk about the most hardcore member

402
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:37,980
 of the Roosevelt family, which is his daughter, Alice.

403
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:39,700
 She was amazing.

404
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:42,420
 She basically was such a handful.

405
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:44,340
 At one stage, Roosevelt said,

406
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:46,340
 she kind of interrupted when he was doing something.

407
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:48,140
 He said, "I can either run the country

408
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:51,700
 "or I can attend to Alice, but I cannot possibly do both."

409
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:53,220
 - Wow. - And she was,

410
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:54,280
 totally hardcore.

411
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:55,840
 - I mean, to be fair, it sounds like he was basically

412
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:58,080
 running a fight club instead of being president.

413
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:00,600
 (audience laughs)

414
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,720
 - She was wild, 'cause he,

415
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,160
 she had a bit of a traumatizing upbringing,

416
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:06,680
 because so his wife and mother died on the same day,

417
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:09,040
 and he was very upset about that, understandably.

418
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:12,000
 And he refused to ever speak his wife's name again.

419
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,840
 But awkwardly, his wife's name was Alice,

420
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:15,560
 as was his daughter's.

421
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:18,480
 And so he never, he refused to ever say his daughter's name.

422
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:19,320
 - What?

423
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:20,440
 - So she was a bit messed up about that,

424
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:23,040
 and then they sort of made friends again a bit,

425
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:25,180
 but she used to do crazy stuff.

426
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:28,140
 Like she smoked publicly on the roof of the White House.

427
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:29,480
 She played poker.

428
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:31,420
 She partied all night.

429
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:34,300
 She kept, so she carried bag around with her all the time,

430
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:35,980
 in which she just kept a dagger,

431
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:38,460
 her pet snake, who was called Emily Spinich,

432
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:39,300
 (audience laughs)

433
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:40,840
 and a copy of the Constitution.

434
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:41,900
 (audience laughs)

435
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:44,580
 - Sorry, the snake was called what?

436
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:45,420
 - Oh, Emily Spinich.

437
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:46,460
 - Emily Spinich, great.

438
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:48,120
 And a copy of the Constitution.

439
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,780
 - The Constitution, the US Constitution, yes.

440
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:50,820
 - Was that a tip from her dad,

441
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:52,460
 in case you go out and assassinate him?

442
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:54,960
 - It was, yeah, fold it up, yeah.

443
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:57,520
 - The reason that she smoked on top of the White House roof

444
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:59,720
 was because he said he forbade her

445
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:02,440
 from smoking cigarettes under my roof.

446
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:04,440
 And so she's like, "Fuck it, I'll go on the roof then."

447
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:05,280
 (audience laughs)

448
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:07,600
 - Ah, what a dick, that's so wonderful.

449
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:10,880
 - And then once Roosevelt left,

450
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,720
 and the next guy came in who was Taft,

451
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:15,080
 and then Woodrow Wilson afterwards,

452
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:17,000
 she was banned from the White House, wasn't she?

453
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,520
 - Oh yeah, was that when she buried a voodoo doll

454
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:20,400
 of someone under the, in the grounds?

455
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:22,860
 - She buried a voodoo doll of Taft's wife

456
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:24,940
 under the grounds before she left.

457
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:27,380
 And then she made some kind of rybald joke

458
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:30,260
 about Woodrow Wilson that no matter how much you Google,

459
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:32,180
 you can never find this joke.

460
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:34,300
 Believe me, that's how I spent the last five days

461
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:35,300
 to find this joke.

462
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:38,060
 But yeah, everyone hated her, who came after her,

463
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:39,820
 and they wouldn't layer in the White House at all.

464
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:41,380
 - Wow, the woman who made a joke

465
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:43,140
 that's too rude for the internet.

466
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:43,980
 - Yeah.

467
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:46,560
 (upbeat music)

468
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:51,680
 - We need to move on to our next fact.

469
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:53,960
 Okay, it is time for fact number two,

470
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:56,280
 and that is Andy.

471
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:59,600
 - My fact is that some squirrels can put themselves

472
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,680
 in a deep freeze for the winter,

473
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:04,360
 then thaw themselves out to have a pee,

474
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:06,220
 and then freeze themselves again.

475
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:08,320
 (audience laughing)

476
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,720
 Yeah, they're very cool.

477
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:11,640
 - They have a piss break during hibernation.

478
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:13,280
 - Well, seems to be, yeah.

479
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:15,720
 So this is the Arctic ground squirrel,

480
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:17,920
 and they are the most extreme hibernators on the planet.

481
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:20,460
 They live so far north.

482
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:23,620
 They hibernate for about 270 days of the year.

483
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:24,460
 - Wow.

484
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:25,280
 - Yeah.

485
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:27,440
 - Imagine not leaving your house for 270 days.

486
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:30,180
 (audience laughing)

487
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:32,220
 - They don't even have Netflix, James.

488
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:34,300
 They don't have anything.

489
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:36,900
 So yeah, they slow down so much

490
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:38,620
 that their hearts beat twice a minute

491
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:40,980
 when they're in this sort of deep, deep chill state.

492
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:43,540
 They can stop breathing for several minutes at a time

493
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:44,940
 when they're in this state,

494
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:46,380
 and most of their body gets down

495
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:49,320
 to almost minus three degrees Celsius.

496
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,720
 It's incredibly cold.

497
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:51,720
 We don't know how they do it,

498
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:53,000
 but they don't freeze,

499
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,480
 as in ice crystals don't form throughout them.

500
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:58,760
 They have some way of stopping little ice crystals forming,

501
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:00,400
 and so, 'cause that would kill them, obviously,

502
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:01,360
 but they aren't that cold,

503
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,080
 and they just look like little stones

504
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:04,240
 on the ground, basically.

505
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:05,920
 - Yeah, so if you've got a bottle of water

506
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:08,920
 and you can kind of make it go really, really, really cold,

507
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:11,600
 but then there's nothing for the ice to form around,

508
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:12,840
 then it won't freeze.

509
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:14,120
 And that's the same with these squirrels.

510
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:15,560
 But what that means is,

511
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:17,740
 if you pick up one of these squirrels that's hibernating

512
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:19,460
 and shake it, it will die.

513
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:22,460
 (audience laughing)

514
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:25,880
 - So don't do that.

515
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:27,620
 - Would it freeze at the same time?

516
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:29,180
 - You would shake it, and then it would like--

517
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:30,180
 - Smashing twice, wouldn't it?

518
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:32,340
 - Yeah, yeah, it'd be like a frozen squirrel.

519
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:34,340
 - And is that because shaking it,

520
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:35,540
 you get a bit of debris in,

521
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:37,500
 and as soon as you get a tiny particle into their body,

522
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,180
 presumably it gets into their blood and it freezes it?

523
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:40,940
 - Exactly, even just by shaking it,

524
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:43,300
 a little bit of carbon dioxide inside the blood

525
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:44,820
 might just come free,

526
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:47,240
 and then that would, everything would nuclear around that.

527
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:49,560
 - But they do have these periodic wake-ups, don't they?

528
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:50,400
 - Yes.

529
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,480
 - Where they sort of wean,

530
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:53,240
 actually don't do much else, really.

531
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:56,920
 In fact, I think, largely, they don't even urinate.

532
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:59,560
 They just wake up in order to go to sleep.

533
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:01,360
 (audience laughing)

534
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:02,200
 - Which is amazing, right?

535
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:03,040
 - Yeah.

536
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:03,880
 - I always thought hibernation was sleep,

537
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:06,200
 but no, it sounds snackering.

538
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,840
 - Yeah, it's absolutely exhausting.

539
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:10,480
 So they've got this store of fat between their shoulders,

540
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,440
 which apparently acts as sort of thermostat.

541
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:14,640
 It's the only bit of them that's staying functional

542
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,980
 when they hibernate, and when they get a bit too cold,

543
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:18,520
 they shiver themselves awake,

544
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:21,100
 and if you watch a video of them, it is very sweet.

545
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:23,060
 They're a little ball that starts shivering

546
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:25,540
 until the little ball of fat pumps blood around,

547
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:28,820
 and it's just so that they can wake up out of hibernation

548
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:31,140
 in order to have eight hours good sleep,

549
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:34,100
 and go into their REM cycles, have some dreams,

550
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:36,900
 and then, otherwise, they get sleep-deprived in hibernation.

551
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:38,300
 - I don't know if you guys read this,

552
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:40,060
 'cause you said they had dreams.

553
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:42,740
 I read one article, and it was from Brian Barnes,

554
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:45,640
 who is the main guy on this subject,

555
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:47,880
 and he said that they take a lot of magic mushrooms

556
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:52,040
 just before hibernation, and nobody knows why they do it.

557
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:53,920
 Well, they're trying to get as much fat as possible,

558
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:55,760
 so they're trying to eat as much as possible,

559
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:58,360
 but it just so happens that the thing that they eat

560
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:00,680
 are these mushrooms, which are hallucinogenic,

561
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:03,200
 and we don't know whether it gives them crazy dreams

562
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:07,000
 for the 270 days, or whether the liver might be able

563
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,800
 to detoxify it or something, so we don't really know,

564
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:12,280
 but it could be that for that whole 270 days,

565
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:14,460
 they're just thinking of dogs with nine legs.

566
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:17,100
 (audience laughing)

567
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:18,460
 - That's so cool.

568
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:21,500
 They're quite chemically altered in lots of ways,

569
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:23,900
 'cause I don't know that, but the other thing they do

570
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:27,060
 to survive is that they produce steroids in their body,

571
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:29,380
 massive, massive levels of steroids

572
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:31,540
 during the summer months when they're building up,

573
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:34,420
 and they build their muscles by a third in size.

574
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:36,620
 They increase by a third in just a few weeks,

575
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:39,700
 and now, normally, that would lead to what we call

576
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:44,700
 the thyroid rage, extra aggressive behavior, real fury.

577
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:45,900
 - Tiny testicles.

578
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:47,580
 - Tiny testicles.

579
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:49,940
 - And a deep urge to spread Christianity, of course.

580
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:52,940
 (audience laughing)

581
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:58,740
 - But for some reason, they don't go into a rage,

582
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:01,780
 so they can survive the testosterone coursing around them,

583
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:05,500
 and the males have to stop when they do hibernate,

584
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:06,880
 and then, this is a bit weird,

585
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,460
 but their testicles shrink a lot,

586
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:09,740
 so we see that.

587
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:13,140
 But then, when they wake up, their testicles swell hugely,

588
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:15,140
 and they get a massive extra rush of testosterone

589
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:16,780
 when they wake up the next time round,

590
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:18,980
 and they basically go through puberty again.

591
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:20,860
 They basically do this every year.

592
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:21,700
 - That's rough.

593
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:22,540
 - Yeah.

594
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:23,380
 - That is rough.

595
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:24,940
 - And the males live way shorter than females do.

596
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:27,220
 They live about six years, and when they wake up,

597
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:29,660
 they do actually go into a sort of fighting frenzy

598
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:31,340
 with other males, and then they have puberty,

599
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:32,980
 and then they hope to mate, and then,

600
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:34,180
 I think the reason they live shorter is

601
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:36,420
 because they have to go through puberty six times

602
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:38,340
 in their life, and it's too embarrassing.

603
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:40,500
 (laughter)

604
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:43,380
 - The voice drop it, where it's a bit wobbly, yeah.

605
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:44,780
 - The acne again.

606
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:46,100
 (laughter)

607
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:48,700
 They all wake for longer than the females, though, aren't they?

608
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:51,860
 They go to sleep a bit later than the ladies.

609
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:54,220
 They sort of store food in a little cache,

610
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:55,900
 whereas the ladies just fall asleep,

611
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:59,140
 and they wake up earlier in order to kind of

612
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:01,540
 start getting ready for mating,

613
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:03,620
 and essentially, the females wake up

614
00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:05,460
 about three weeks after the males,

615
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:09,740
 and their entire waking life is waking up

616
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:11,260
 immediately being mated with,

617
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:14,140
 within 12 hours of waking up by a male,

618
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:16,900
 being pregnant, gestating for 25 days,

619
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:19,940
 caring for the young for 10 weeks, going back to sleep.

620
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:21,260
 That's their lives.

621
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:23,340
 - They probably need a lot of sleep after all that, though,

622
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:25,740
 don't they, fairness? - They do.

623
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:27,820
 - They have very weird burrow systems,

624
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:29,820
 or very clever burrow systems, actually,

625
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:31,980
 so they have three different kinds of house.

626
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:34,260
 They don't just have one basic burrow.

627
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:36,180
 The way they know that is 'cause when you're researching

628
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:38,620
 arctic ground squirrels, when researchers are researching them,

629
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:40,540
 they have to make really detailed maps

630
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:42,980
 of where all the burrow entrances and exits are,

631
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:45,380
 so that if you take one away to study them,

632
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:47,220
 when you put them back, you put them at the right door,

633
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:49,780
 like you don't put them in someone else's house.

634
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:51,860
 - So they don't notice when they wake up.

635
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:53,060
 They have no idea someone's been

636
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:54,620
 and rearranged the house, basically.

637
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:56,100
 - I guess so, yeah, they don't wake up and go,

638
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:57,940
 "Where am I? That's not my picture."

639
00:21:57,940 --> 00:22:01,020
 - You could put them the other way around

640
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:03,180
 when they're hibernating just to freak them out.

641
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:04,980
 - So they think, "Oh, lovely, I'll go to sleep facing

642
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:06,700
 "my favorite nut," or whatever.

643
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:10,100
 And then they wake up facing their second favorite nut,

644
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:12,500
 and you've... - That's like my wife.

645
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:15,140
 She goes to sleep facing her first favorite, Dan,

646
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:18,900
 and she wakes up with a second, Dan.

647
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:25,300
 - I mean, it did sound like you were gonna say

648
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:27,060
 "facing her first favorite nut."

649
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:30,060
 (audience laughing)

650
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:36,940
 - Oh, poor woman.

651
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:39,140
 - I was just a steer away for a second,

652
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:41,100
 but on hibernation, I was reading a blog

653
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:42,780
 about hibernating hedgehogs,

654
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:45,780
 and there was this wonderful thing where a person says,

655
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:48,540
 "A way that you can tell that a hedgehog is hibernating

656
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:50,820
 "is 'cause they look like they're dead, basically,

657
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:52,980
 "if you go up to them, they're in the ball.

658
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:55,620
 "All you need to do is go right up to one,

659
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:58,940
 "put your ear next to one, and you know it's hibernating

660
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:00,740
 "'cause you can hear it snoring."

661
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:03,500
 It's not sweet, a little (snoring)

662
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:05,900
 of a hedgehog, and they snore when they hibernate,

663
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:09,100
 not all of them sometimes, and possibly not even then,

664
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:13,540
 but it's, yeah, it's just from a blog, but...

665
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:15,420
 - That's really sweet.

666
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:18,420
 I have a fact about squirrels, other squirrels,

667
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:20,140
 Californian ground squirrels,

668
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:21,660
 slightly different kind of ground squirrel.

669
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:25,660
 So in 1918, California basically decided to wage war

670
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:28,220
 on the squirrels, and they had something called Squirrel Week,

671
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:30,260
 where posters were put up all over the state,

672
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:32,700
 encouraging the children of California

673
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:35,420
 to kill as many squirrels as they could.

674
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:36,260
 - Whoa.

675
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:37,940
 - And there were posters, just aimed at children,

676
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:40,860
 saying things like, "Slay the mother squirrel

677
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:43,700
 "during breeding season, March to May,"

678
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:45,980
 'cause they were quite invasive, and they ate a lot of crops,

679
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:48,260
 and they carried bubonic plague, which is a bad thing,

680
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:51,340
 so there were reasons for it, but it was pretty dark,

681
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:54,380
 so there was a pamphlet which advised how you could hook up

682
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:56,420
 your exhaust pipe to a squirrel burrow.

683
00:23:56,420 --> 00:23:57,260
 - Jesus.

684
00:23:57,260 --> 00:23:59,540
 - And wipe out a whole batch of them, like that.

685
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:02,300
 And they were depicted with little German soldier helmets,

686
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:03,940
 because the First World War was still going on.

687
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:06,140
 It was saying, "We may be fighting Germany,

688
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:08,140
 "but we're also fighting the squirrels."

689
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:10,500
 In Squirrel Week, the children of California

690
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:13,940
 killed 104,000 squirrels just in that week.

691
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:15,140
 - Oh.

692
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:17,100
 - And there were prizes for the schools that did best.

693
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:19,380
 - Yeah, wasn't there one girl who had like a kill list

694
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:21,100
 of over 3,000, alone?

695
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:22,180
 - I don't know, I didn't know that.

696
00:24:22,180 --> 00:24:24,500
 - Yeah, she was like the head of the top of the pack.

697
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:26,820
 - She went on to single-handedly defeat the Nazis

698
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:28,300
 to be on the following wall.

699
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:30,460
 (laughing)

700
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:33,660
 - The Cape Ground Squirrel is an interesting ground squirrel,

701
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:37,540
 and that's because they can self-filate,

702
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:39,900
 and not only can they do, they do so.

703
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:42,460
 (laughing)

704
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:43,300
 - You would.

705
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:46,060
 - It's not like you and me just telling people we can do.

706
00:24:46,060 --> 00:24:46,900
 They prove it.

707
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:49,220
 - Prove it.

708
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:51,620
 (laughing)

709
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:53,180
 - For God's sake, don't prove it.

710
00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:55,220
 (laughing)

711
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:57,540
 - Not before you showed me your favorite nuts.

712
00:24:57,540 --> 00:24:58,380
 Right.

713
00:24:58,380 --> 00:25:00,020
 (laughing)

714
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:04,180
 Can I get on about this self-masturbating squirrel?

715
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:05,620
 - You know self-masturbating is the only

716
00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:07,020
 kind of masturbating, James.

717
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:09,060
 (laughing)

718
00:25:09,060 --> 00:25:09,900
 - Well.

719
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:12,140
 (laughing)

720
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:15,340
 Go on.

721
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:18,220
 - If I do the fact, some of it might get in the podcast.

722
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:22,020
 - 'Cause if I masturbate a pig for the...

723
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:23,820
 (laughing)

724
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:25,180
 - I don't think you're masturbating.

725
00:25:25,180 --> 00:25:26,260
 I think you're just...

726
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:27,100
 - You're giving it a handy.

727
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:27,940
 - Yeah.

728
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:28,900
 - No, no, no, no.

729
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:31,260
 Because there's a breeding program for pigs.

730
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:32,660
 I'm not just, I'm not just...

731
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:35,860
 Sorry, just to dress the seam.

732
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:37,300
 (laughing)

733
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:40,340
 I think I would be masturbating that pig.

734
00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:42,940
 - I think technically that's probably not true.

735
00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:43,780
 - Really?

736
00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:45,180
 - I would say technically.

737
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:47,500
 - Well, I've gotta go and refill in all the forms now.

738
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:49,740
 (laughing)

739
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:53,060
 - You've gotta rename the blog.

740
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:55,300
 (laughing)

741
00:25:55,300 --> 00:26:07,740
 - So, squirrels, they do it supposedly

742
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:10,740
 as a form of self-medication, okay?

743
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:12,980
 And the idea is that if they clean their genitals,

744
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:16,100
 it might stop them from getting an STI, okay?

745
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:19,860
 And the best way for them to do that is to masturbate.

746
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:21,660
 However, they live in the desert

747
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:24,700
 and they can't afford to lose any water.

748
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:28,780
 And so they need to get the water back into their body.

749
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:31,060
 And so they clean their genitals

750
00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:34,020
 and they take in their fluids.

751
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:35,340
 - Okay.

752
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:37,620
 It's base two and base three is what you're saying.

753
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:39,500
 (laughing)

754
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:40,340
 - Base five.

755
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:43,620
 Golly.

756
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:44,460
 - Well, gosh.

757
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:46,220
 - Now, whatever works.

758
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:47,380
 - That's the thing about this podcast,

759
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:50,180
 you always learn something you didn't know before.

760
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:51,180
 - But there are, yeah.

761
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:53,340
 Right, well, let's.

762
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:55,500
 - We've actually got to move on, guys.

763
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:57,500
 (laughing)

764
00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:59,780
 We don't actually need to, but I really think we should.

765
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:01,260
 (laughing)

766
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:02,860
 I have one more thing about,

767
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:05,020
 this was about going to the Lou in the middle of the night.

768
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:05,860
 - Oh, yeah.

769
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:09,580
 - So Victorian tourists, I mean 19th century tourists,

770
00:27:09,580 --> 00:27:12,140
 what you would do if you were a tourist in France

771
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:14,700
 because lots of, you know, accommodation

772
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:17,740
 would not have much in the way of sanitation.

773
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:19,420
 Women would purchase an object

774
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:22,340
 which was sold called the Inodorous Standard Pale,

775
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:23,940
 okay, and pale is in bucket.

776
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:25,700
 And it had a mahogany rim

777
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:27,940
 and a hermetically closing cover.

778
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:29,500
 And it was basically a,

779
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:31,300
 what are we calling it, kind of chamber pot.

780
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:32,340
 But the brilliant thing was

781
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:34,380
 it was disguised as a hat box

782
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:37,140
 so that you could carry it around without embarrassment.

783
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:38,260
 (laughing)

784
00:27:38,260 --> 00:27:40,060
 - But you definitely don't want to put your hats in it.

785
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:42,780
 If someone asks, can I borrow your hat box?

786
00:27:42,780 --> 00:27:45,620
 I've got a hat spare hat I need to carry.

787
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:46,860
 What is the excuse,

788
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:48,980
 the recommended excuse you're supposed to cook?

789
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:49,820
 - I don't know.

790
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:50,860
 - But it is a good excuse

791
00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:53,180
 if you accidentally piss in someone's hat box.

792
00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:55,420
 (laughing)

793
00:27:55,420 --> 00:28:00,660
 - We need to move on to our next fact.

794
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:04,660
 Okay, it is time for fact number three,

795
00:28:04,660 --> 00:28:06,380
 and that is James.

796
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:10,040
 - Okay, my fact this week is that in 1385,

797
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:12,620
 a four year court case began

798
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:16,140
 after two nights embarrassingly turned up to a battle

799
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:18,540
 wearing the same coat of arms.

800
00:28:18,540 --> 00:28:21,100
 (laughing)

801
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:22,220
 How embarrassing.

802
00:28:22,220 --> 00:28:24,260
 - Yeah, were they completely mortified?

803
00:28:24,260 --> 00:28:25,100
 Did someone go home?

804
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:26,380
 Did they both fight the battle?

805
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:27,660
 - They both fought the battle.

806
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:30,140
 It was a bit later that the court case happened.

807
00:28:30,140 --> 00:28:33,580
 So this was during the Hundred Years War with France

808
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:37,580
 in 1385 and Scotland had signed a pact with France

809
00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:39,500
 and some French soldiers had arrived

810
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:40,800
 north of the border.

811
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:43,000
 And so Richard II just come of age

812
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,280
 trying to kind of show that he meant business.

813
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:47,680
 He decided he was gonna invade Scotland.

814
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:49,480
 And so they all went over this big army

815
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:50,680
 to invade Scotland.

816
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:54,040
 And when they did, there was a guy called Richard Scroop,

817
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:55,880
 spelled Scroop but pronounced Scroop.

818
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:57,920
 He was the first Baron of Bolton.

819
00:28:57,920 --> 00:29:00,120
 And so Robert Grovesner of Cheshire

820
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:02,200
 and they both turned up and they realized

821
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:04,320
 that they had the exact same coat of arms,

822
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:07,440
 which was an azure with a bend or,

823
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:10,520
 that's a blue background with a gold stash.

824
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:12,640
 And everyone felt very awkward.

825
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:16,080
 - The court case sounds amazing.

826
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:17,940
 - The court case really was,

827
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:20,140
 it was the who's who of the 14th century.

828
00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:20,980
 - Really?

829
00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:21,820
 Well, it was a bit of,

830
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:23,060
 I think it was a bit of a fix, this court case.

831
00:29:23,060 --> 00:29:24,320
 So it was, who'd you say?

832
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:28,300
 It was Scroop of Bolton against Grovesner of Cheshire.

833
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:30,860
 But it was held, I think, in York Minster.

834
00:29:30,860 --> 00:29:32,980
 And in York Minster, the Scroop coat of arms

835
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:33,900
 was all over the place.

836
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:36,220
 So it's kind of subtle branding for the Scroop side.

837
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:38,920
 - Yeah, I should say it's not the good Bolton in Lancashire.

838
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:40,560
 It's the shit Bolton in Yorkshire.

839
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:41,400
 - Ah.

840
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:44,240
 - Okay.

841
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:45,980
 - Right.

842
00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:46,820
 - Got it.

843
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:47,900
 - He's got that off his chest.

844
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:50,160
 - That's why in York Minster they had his coat of arms.

845
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:51,000
 - Got it, got it, got it.

846
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:51,840
 That makes more sense, actually.

847
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:52,680
 I was wondering about that.

848
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:53,500
 - Yeah.

849
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:54,340
 - But then it turned out later on,

850
00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:55,240
 after this court case was over,

851
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:58,560
 there was a third family also using the same coat of arms.

852
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:00,260
 But they were in Cornwall and everyone said,

853
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:01,260
 oh, well it's Cornwall.

854
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:03,200
 You know, they said, basically they said,

855
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:04,080
 well, it's a different country.

856
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:05,120
 So the rules are different there.

857
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:06,680
 - Yes, at the time it was.

858
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:08,960
 - Well, also the guy in Cornwall who claimed

859
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:12,140
 that his crest was the same was a guy called Carmenow.

860
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:15,900
 And he claimed that his crest had been given by King Arthur,

861
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:18,280
 which was quite impressive considering he didn't exist.

862
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:19,540
 (laughing)

863
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:21,980
 - We didn't definitively not exist.

864
00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:22,820
 - What?

865
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:24,500
 - Yeah, King Arthur didn't definitively not exist.

866
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:27,700
 There are later reports of a character called Arthur.

867
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:29,580
 Anyway, we don't, but he's not an absolute,

868
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:31,020
 he's not like Peter Pan.

869
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:32,420
 - Well, it's a good job you weren't in charge

870
00:30:32,420 --> 00:30:33,580
 of this court case either.

871
00:30:33,580 --> 00:30:35,100
 (laughing)

872
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:37,140
 - Wow, so there's maybe a King Arthur.

873
00:30:37,140 --> 00:30:39,520
 - He didn't do any of the stuff.

874
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:40,480
 - Well, that sucks.

875
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:41,320
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

876
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:42,160
 (laughing)

877
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:43,600
 - That's just a guy called Arthur then.

878
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:45,600
 (laughing)

879
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:46,920
 - It's kind of like Robin Hood.

880
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:48,040
 There's someone with the name,

881
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:49,160
 but none of the rest of it's true.

882
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:50,760
 So it's not even worth it.

883
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:51,600
 - Okay.

884
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:52,960
 - Who was who of the 14th century?

885
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,480
 I want to know what a court case of the,

886
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:55,800
 who's who of the 14th century was.

887
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:57,960
 - They named a single person for the 14th century.

888
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:00,920
 They were that, what was that, Geoffrey Charter?

889
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:02,560
 - Yes, exactly.

890
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:04,520
 What was that, John of Gaunt?

891
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:05,720
 - Owen Glendauer?

892
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:06,900
 - Yes, him as well.

893
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:08,320
 - That really is a who to.

894
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:10,220
 - Anyone I've heard of in the 14th century

895
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:11,500
 was in this court case.

896
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:14,620
 - Was this the most exciting court case of the era?

897
00:31:14,620 --> 00:31:15,820
 - It doesn't sound like a big deal.

898
00:31:15,820 --> 00:31:16,660
 - It really wasn't.

899
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:17,560
 It was quite dull.

900
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:18,880
 (laughing)

901
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:20,540
 It was just basically, everyone came in.

902
00:31:20,540 --> 00:31:22,740
 And so let's say John of Gaunt turned up.

903
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:24,880
 John of Gaunt would go in and he would say,

904
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:27,620
 "I once saw this guy with this coat of arms on this date.

905
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:29,660
 And I saw this guy with a coat of arms on this date.

906
00:31:29,660 --> 00:31:30,940
 And I saw this on this date."

907
00:31:30,940 --> 00:31:32,740
 And then they got all of the evidence together

908
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:35,480
 and they worked out who had the best claim on it.

909
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:36,800
 - Yeah, precedence, wasn't it?

910
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:37,640
 - Exactly.

911
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:38,480
 - Yeah, who would assume it at first.

912
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:41,800
 So this was in the court of chivalry.

913
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:43,600
 And the court of chivalry is an exciting thing

914
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:46,400
 because this is a real court that exists

915
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:49,640
 and it hasn't sat since 1954, okay?

916
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:51,280
 - It really is dead, isn't it?

917
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:54,520
 - Well, it might be coming back.

918
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:57,520
 - Wait a minute, but what were the knights of armor in 1954?

919
00:31:57,520 --> 00:31:59,760
 - Oh, the 1954 case was a dispute

920
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:02,620
 between Manchester Corporation and Manchester Palace

921
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:06,420
 of Varieties over unlicensed use of the Manchester coat of arms.

922
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:09,860
 That is dull, but before that, so, okay,

923
00:32:09,860 --> 00:32:11,940
 there is a chance that the court of chivalry

924
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:14,020
 is going to have to sit sometime soon

925
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:16,060
 because of weather spoons, okay?

926
00:32:16,060 --> 00:32:17,540
 This is so exciting.

927
00:32:17,540 --> 00:32:22,540
 So last year, last year, Barry Town Council in Wales.

928
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:24,180
 - I thought that was his name.

929
00:32:24,180 --> 00:32:26,500
 (all laughing)

930
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:28,420
 What an unfortunate Sunday night.

931
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:30,680
 - No, he invented the Town Council.

932
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:31,560
 It's very impressive.

933
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:32,980
 Yeah, what a guy.

934
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:35,560
 Sorry, yeah.

935
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:37,100
 Barry Town Council in Wales.

936
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:40,640
 They were furious with weather spoons

937
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:42,560
 because weather spoons in Barry

938
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:45,720
 had put the coat of arms of Barry,

939
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:49,840
 the Barry coat of arms on a carpet in their pub.

940
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:51,360
 - Oh, wow. - And Barry Town Council said,

941
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:53,240
 hang on a second, you've got people walking

942
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:55,880
 on the Barry coat of arms, maybe they're going to the bar,

943
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:57,520
 maybe they're going to the toilet.

944
00:32:57,520 --> 00:32:58,740
 We don't know where they're going.

945
00:32:58,740 --> 00:33:00,400
 You know, maybe they've got a dog with them.

946
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:02,560
 I mean, they said it was very disrespectful.

947
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:04,080
 Tim Martin, the boss of weather spoons,

948
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:05,660
 refused to remove the carpet.

949
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:07,360
 He said it's a perfectly good carpet.

950
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:08,980
 We paid a lot of money for it.

951
00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:10,500
 Just let it wear out and we'll replace it

952
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:11,740
 in 10 years or so, whatever.

953
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:14,580
 So they may yet go to the court of chivalry

954
00:33:14,580 --> 00:33:16,120
 if anyone can be bothered to.

955
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:17,360
 - Cool.

956
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:19,480
 - Yeah, and they'll have to resurrect the entire court.

957
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:20,620
 - And do you think it will be a who's

958
00:33:20,620 --> 00:33:23,440
 who of the 21st century with sort of George Clooney,

959
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:24,780
 Barack Obama?

960
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:27,600
 (all laughing)

961
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:29,180
 Have you ever met Barry Town Council?

962
00:33:29,180 --> 00:33:32,260
 I've met Barry Town Council, yeah.

963
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:35,040
 - I love the rules of chivalry, the whole chivalry thing.

964
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:37,380
 I didn't quite know what goes into becoming a knight

965
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:39,780
 when you were made and you were kind of trained

966
00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:42,420
 in order to become one, but it was more than battle.

967
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:45,140
 It was all these things like you had to learn

968
00:33:45,140 --> 00:33:46,780
 how to box, wrestle, run.

969
00:33:46,780 --> 00:33:47,940
 You had to read, write.

970
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:49,460
 You had to play the harp and sing.

971
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:51,580
 That was part of becoming a knight, yeah,

972
00:33:51,580 --> 00:33:52,820
 which is really sweet.

973
00:33:52,820 --> 00:33:55,020
 - You also, you had to be a very good wooer.

974
00:33:55,020 --> 00:33:57,240
 That was part of the code of chivalry,

975
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:59,900
 was you had to devotedly woo one woman.

976
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:01,860
 And it didn't, the woman could be married.

977
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:03,260
 That was fine, Lancelot, I think,

978
00:34:03,260 --> 00:34:05,300
 was constantly wooing a married woman.

979
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:07,700
 - Again, possibly didn't exist or?

980
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:10,540
 - No, yeah, yeah, he was a figure of chivalric mythology.

981
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:13,300
 But, you know, he was like a being to emulate.

982
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:14,780
 - He was wooing Gwynevere, wasn't he?

983
00:34:14,780 --> 00:34:15,940
 - Yeah, I thought he went for--

984
00:34:15,940 --> 00:34:17,380
 - He went for the top trumps.

985
00:34:17,380 --> 00:34:18,220
 - Top trumps, yeah. - I really went for it.

986
00:34:18,220 --> 00:34:19,060
 - Yeah, yeah.

987
00:34:19,060 --> 00:34:19,900
 - Martha's wife, yeah.

988
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:20,980
 - You can't all hope for Gwynevere.

989
00:34:20,980 --> 00:34:24,380
 - Gwynevere also, I think, a figure of chivalric myth,

990
00:34:24,380 --> 00:34:25,380
 so not real.

991
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:27,860
 - So all of these people are setting the standard

992
00:34:27,860 --> 00:34:29,060
 that you're supposed to imitate.

993
00:34:29,060 --> 00:34:30,740
 And the reason it all came in, the chivalric codes,

994
00:34:30,740 --> 00:34:32,900
 was 'cause knights were so badly behaved.

995
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:35,500
 They were just like, rampant around the countryside.

996
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:37,180
 So there were lots of books written

997
00:34:37,180 --> 00:34:39,860
 about how to correct knight's behavior.

998
00:34:39,860 --> 00:34:41,860
 And so there were all these courtesy books written

999
00:34:41,860 --> 00:34:44,420
 in the sort of 12th century and 13th century.

1000
00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:46,340
 There was one called The Book of the Civilized Man,

1001
00:34:46,340 --> 00:34:47,260
 directed at knights.

1002
00:34:47,260 --> 00:34:51,700
 And it just had sort of a bullet-pointed list of rules.

1003
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:54,500
 So don't spit, don't talk with your mouth full.

1004
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:55,980
 Don't take huge helpings,

1005
00:34:55,980 --> 00:34:58,460
 don't blow your nose on the tablecloth.

1006
00:34:58,460 --> 00:35:01,380
 All things today that we would agree with.

1007
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:02,700
 - Don't wind off a pig.

1008
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:05,540
 (audience laughing)

1009
00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:07,380
 - Don't auto-filate a mixed company.

1010
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:10,140
 (audience laughing)

1011
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:11,900
 You may be thirsty, but the bar's over there.

1012
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:14,220
 (audience laughing)

1013
00:35:14,220 --> 00:35:15,500
 - There was a don't defecate.

1014
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:17,620
 Well, sorry, there was.

1015
00:35:17,620 --> 00:35:18,660
 You weren't allowed to defecate.

1016
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:20,300
 You weren't allowed to attack your enemy

1017
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:21,580
 while he was defecating.

1018
00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:23,260
 (audience laughing)

1019
00:35:23,260 --> 00:35:25,100
 Unchivalrous, yeah.

1020
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:27,580
 - Unless he's riding a horse to cure his diarrhea,

1021
00:35:27,580 --> 00:35:30,060
 in which case, he's on a horse, he's fair game.

1022
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:31,180
 - Yeah.

1023
00:35:31,180 --> 00:35:33,140
 - Wow, have you heard of the Scottish court

1024
00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:35,140
 and what they do to badly behaving knights?

1025
00:35:35,140 --> 00:35:38,540
 They will destroy your arms, I presume, your coat of arms.

1026
00:35:38,540 --> 00:35:42,540
 (audience laughing)

1027
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:43,380
 It will be very mean.

1028
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:44,940
 They will break your stained glass windows,

1029
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:46,680
 which have got your coat of arms in them.

1030
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:49,860
 They will smash any unwarranted seals.

1031
00:35:49,860 --> 00:35:52,860
 (audience laughing)

1032
00:35:52,860 --> 00:35:54,860
 Seals, like seals.

1033
00:35:54,860 --> 00:35:58,180
 But then they will issue a letter of horning, okay?

1034
00:35:58,180 --> 00:35:59,020
 - Of what, sorry?

1035
00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:01,120
 - Of horning, like horn, the horn.

1036
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:02,020
 - Yeah, sorry.

1037
00:36:02,020 --> 00:36:05,460
 - Like, I've just given this pig the horn for my dog.

1038
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:08,300
 (audience laughing)

1039
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:10,700
 But they do a letter, which denounces you as an outlaw,

1040
00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:13,060
 and then they have three blasts of a horn,

1041
00:36:13,060 --> 00:36:16,220
 and that means you have technically been put to the horn.

1042
00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:17,780
 Pretty exciting stuff, yeah.

1043
00:36:17,780 --> 00:36:18,780
 (audience laughing)

1044
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:20,100
 - And wait, what does that mean to have been put,

1045
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:21,780
 aside from the fact that you do three blasts of a horn,

1046
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:22,620
 but what's that do to you?

1047
00:36:22,620 --> 00:36:24,060
 - I don't actually know what the ramifications are.

1048
00:36:24,060 --> 00:36:26,100
 - You're not a knight anymore, right?

1049
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:26,940
 You're a knight.

1050
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:27,780
 - Yeah, you're not a knight.

1051
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:28,660
 You've been put to the horn.

1052
00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:31,380
 - Do you know why they're called coats of arms?

1053
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:33,980
 It's because you used to have a coat that you wore

1054
00:36:33,980 --> 00:36:36,300
 over your arms, your armor,

1055
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:37,460
 and that's where the word comes from.

1056
00:36:37,460 --> 00:36:38,300
 - Really?

1057
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:39,140
 - Isn't that amazing?

1058
00:36:39,140 --> 00:36:41,380
 - But everyone was hoping that it was a coat made of arms.

1059
00:36:41,380 --> 00:36:43,180
 - Yeah.

1060
00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:44,100
 - That's the dream.

1061
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:45,500
 - But you used to have your armor,

1062
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:47,300
 and you would always wear a cloak over it,

1063
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:50,220
 and the reason being that if you're fighting somewhere hot,

1064
00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:52,420
 then wearing armor is pretty bad,

1065
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:54,300
 like you're basically gonna cook in there,

1066
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:55,460
 and so if you wore a cloak,

1067
00:36:55,460 --> 00:36:56,940
 then it could stop you from getting,

1068
00:36:56,940 --> 00:36:59,020
 from the sun's rays from cooking you,

1069
00:36:59,020 --> 00:37:00,820
 and so you would always have to wear this cloak,

1070
00:37:00,820 --> 00:37:01,940
 and on the back of the cloak,

1071
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:04,620
 it would have your arms, your coat of arms,

1072
00:37:04,620 --> 00:37:06,020
 and so that's where the word came from.

1073
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:06,860
 - Wow. - Hey.

1074
00:37:06,860 --> 00:37:07,700
 - It's not cool, yeah.

1075
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:09,700
 - Superman, basically, like the original.

1076
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:10,540
 - Yeah.

1077
00:37:10,540 --> 00:37:11,360
 - Saying who you are.

1078
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:13,340
 - If you go on your back, that's so cool.

1079
00:37:13,340 --> 00:37:15,660
 - And the idea was you wanted people to know who you are,

1080
00:37:15,660 --> 00:37:17,940
 because if you're an important person in a battle,

1081
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:19,620
 you don't wanna be killed, you wanna be captured.

1082
00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:20,860
 Well, you don't wanna be captured.

1083
00:37:20,860 --> 00:37:24,180
 You wanna win, but if you're your second best,

1084
00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:26,660
 if you don't win, is to not die.

1085
00:37:26,660 --> 00:37:29,900
 - The team talking, like the halfway mark, right?

1086
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:31,420
 We've given up on a win,

1087
00:37:31,420 --> 00:37:33,800
 but we are going for being captured, all of us.

1088
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:38,980
 - So yeah, so you wanted to be captured,

1089
00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:40,860
 and so you would have this kind of coat of armor,

1090
00:37:40,860 --> 00:37:43,760
 so that people would see you on battle and not kill you.

1091
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:45,320
 They'd think, oh, well, he's worth something.

1092
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:47,080
 I'm gonna take him instead of killing him,

1093
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:48,400
 and then I'll be able to get some money.

1094
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:50,880
 - Quite catching someone else's shiny pog.

1095
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:51,720
 - Is it? - Yeah.

1096
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:53,780
 - Yeah, that was a very specific,

1097
00:37:53,780 --> 00:37:57,280
 sort of 1994 kids there.

1098
00:37:57,280 --> 00:38:00,200
 Jeff Bezos has a coat of arms.

1099
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:02,720
 Yeah, it's got two tortoises and a rocket.

1100
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:03,560
 - A rocket?

1101
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:04,400
 - Yeah.

1102
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:06,680
 - I'm just imagining a cock on bull's formation.

1103
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:09,480
 (audience laughing)

1104
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:10,800
 - You know what, I haven't seen it.

1105
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:11,620
 - I presume it is.

1106
00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:12,460
 - It's kind of good.

1107
00:38:12,460 --> 00:38:13,300
 - It's kind of good to assume.

1108
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:14,140
 It's Jeff Bezos.

1109
00:38:14,140 --> 00:38:14,980
 - Absolutely.

1110
00:38:14,980 --> 00:38:16,780
 You can just get them made though,

1111
00:38:16,780 --> 00:38:19,460
 'cause there's the College of Arms in the UK

1112
00:38:19,460 --> 00:38:20,460
 except Scotland.

1113
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:23,100
 Do you know what the Blue Mantle Persuivant

1114
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:25,180
 at the College of Arms gets paid each year?

1115
00:38:25,180 --> 00:38:26,620
 - I didn't know what most of those words were.

1116
00:38:26,620 --> 00:38:27,460
 - No.

1117
00:38:27,460 --> 00:38:28,300
 (audience laughing)

1118
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:29,180
 - There's a lot of kind of

1119
00:38:29,180 --> 00:38:30,020
 cod latin and comprehension stuff.

1120
00:38:30,020 --> 00:38:32,140
 No, Blue Mantle Persuivant, or Persuivant,

1121
00:38:32,140 --> 00:38:34,140
 is a junior position at the College of Arms.

1122
00:38:34,140 --> 00:38:36,100
 Guess what he gets paid.

1123
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:39,140
 - A tenner a year, or seven shillings and six pence,

1124
00:38:39,140 --> 00:38:40,180
 half a crown.

1125
00:38:40,180 --> 00:38:42,600
 Three sticks and a dead porcupine.

1126
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:43,440
 - Lovely.

1127
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:44,760
 - Pogs.

1128
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:45,600
 Pogs.

1129
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:46,960
 (audience laughing)

1130
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:49,280
 - Anna was closest, it's $13.95.

1131
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:50,120
 - Really?

1132
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:52,720
 - For the ceremony where he was invested in his role,

1133
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:54,280
 he had to buy a pair of silk tights

1134
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:56,320
 which cost double his annual salary.

1135
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:57,280
 (audience laughing)

1136
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:59,800
 - And is that taxpayer funded for God's sake?

1137
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:02,480
 (audience laughing)

1138
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:03,400
 - Who knows?

1139
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:06,360
 Do you know what all those weird words you just said?

1140
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:08,920
 All that language, do you know what it's called?

1141
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:09,760
 - No.

1142
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:10,820
 - It's called Blazen.

1143
00:39:10,820 --> 00:39:13,700
 So in heraldry, the weird language of heraldry,

1144
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:15,180
 which is lots of stuff that we don't understand,

1145
00:39:15,180 --> 00:39:17,220
 it's called Blazen, and all the vocab,

1146
00:39:17,220 --> 00:39:20,620
 and it's also related to the habits of heraldry,

1147
00:39:20,620 --> 00:39:21,820
 so all the traditions.

1148
00:39:21,820 --> 00:39:23,900
 So for instance, there's a difference between English

1149
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:26,580
 and Scottish heraldry in Blazen.

1150
00:39:26,580 --> 00:39:30,420
 And that is how you erase a bear's head.

1151
00:39:30,420 --> 00:39:33,260
 And so this is, you know, if you see a coat of arms,

1152
00:39:33,260 --> 00:39:34,980
 then you'll sometimes have an animal,

1153
00:39:34,980 --> 00:39:36,660
 like a lion or a bear on it.

1154
00:39:36,660 --> 00:39:38,580
 And if you've got an erased head,

1155
00:39:38,580 --> 00:39:40,440
 what that means is a head that's been decapitated

1156
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:42,200
 from a body, or it looks like it's been torn off

1157
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:43,120
 from a body.

1158
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:45,960
 So it's got sort of ragged edges in the neck.

1159
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:46,880
 You will have seen it a lot.

1160
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:48,120
 But the way you tell the difference between

1161
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:50,520
 an English coat of arms and a Scottish coat of arms is,

1162
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:54,560
 a bear's head in English heraldry is erased horizontally

1163
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:55,640
 under the neck.

1164
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:57,760
 And so it goes across and you get some neck in.

1165
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:00,680
 Whereas in Scotland, it's erased vertically

1166
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:02,120
 and you cut the neck off.

1167
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:04,400
 So if you imagine a vertical line going down.

1168
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:07,400
 So if a bear's got a neck, English, no neck,

1169
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:08,820
 Scottish.

1170
00:40:08,820 --> 00:40:10,980
 - We've been doing this podcast for six and a half years now.

1171
00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:13,420
 And I think that is the least useful piece of information.

1172
00:40:13,420 --> 00:40:15,820
 (audience laughing)

1173
00:40:15,820 --> 00:40:16,660
 - Ever said.

1174
00:40:16,660 --> 00:40:20,020
 - Addy, if you are galloping into battle against the Scots,

1175
00:40:20,020 --> 00:40:22,740
 which may well happen in the near future.

1176
00:40:22,740 --> 00:40:23,740
 (audience laughing)

1177
00:40:23,740 --> 00:40:25,180
 You're gonna need to know.

1178
00:40:25,180 --> 00:40:27,760
 (upbeat music)

1179
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:33,140
 - We need to move on to our final fact of the show.

1180
00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:35,340
 It is time for our final fact of the show.

1181
00:40:35,340 --> 00:40:38,480
 And that is Anna.

1182
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:41,760
 - My fact this week is that the Audubon Bird Protection

1183
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:45,900
 Society has warned its members against bird-splaining.

1184
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:48,080
 (audience laughing)

1185
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:50,800
 - So, mansplaining is when a man annoyingly.

1186
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:53,800
 (audience laughing)

1187
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:59,520
 So, but if mansplaining is when a man is awkwardly

1188
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:01,080
 explaining something which he doesn't need to,

1189
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:03,560
 is bird-splaining when a bird explains something to you?

1190
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:04,640
 (audience laughing)

1191
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:06,020
 - We don't call them birds these days,

1192
00:41:06,020 --> 00:41:06,860
 we call them women.

1193
00:41:06,860 --> 00:41:09,860
 (audience laughing)

1194
00:41:09,860 --> 00:41:15,500
 - I've been asleep for 270 days.

1195
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:17,060
 (audience laughing)

1196
00:41:17,060 --> 00:41:19,440
 And my testicles are so sore.

1197
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:21,780
 (audience laughing)

1198
00:41:21,780 --> 00:41:23,780
 - It's not, you're right, it's an incorrect use

1199
00:41:23,780 --> 00:41:26,700
 of the explaining etymology because it's not like

1200
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:28,420
 when a pigeon gets really patronizing.

1201
00:41:28,420 --> 00:41:31,900
 It's basically, this is an article on the Audubon website

1202
00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:35,320
 which is sort of the authority on birds.

1203
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:37,920
 And it was a bird writer, Becca Heisman.

1204
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:41,280
 She was sort of inspired by birdwatchers who do things

1205
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:44,640
 like get extremely agitated if people refer to

1206
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:47,360
 a Canadian goose as opposed to a Canada goose

1207
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:49,200
 or a seagull.

1208
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:51,120
 Birdwatchers hate people calling it a seagull

1209
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:52,600
 'cause there's no such thing as a seagull.

1210
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:55,040
 There are gulls, lot of them don't live by the sea.

1211
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:56,880
 A seagull apparently is a nonsense term.

1212
00:41:56,880 --> 00:42:00,440
 Her warning to birdwatchers is, and I'm repeating it now,

1213
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:03,840
 that it can put people off if as soon as you casually

1214
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:05,680
 mention a seagull in conversation, someone says,

1215
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:07,280
 "Well actually there's no such thing as a seagull,

1216
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:08,860
 "so you're not making any sense."

1217
00:42:08,860 --> 00:42:09,860
 (audience laughing)

1218
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:14,860
 And that's the official word of the birdwatching society.

1219
00:42:14,860 --> 00:42:17,740
 - But that's my life with you three.

1220
00:42:17,740 --> 00:42:20,700
 (audience laughing)

1221
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:21,980
 - Yeah, sorry about that.

1222
00:42:21,980 --> 00:42:25,140
 But yeah, birdwatchers, they're a pedantic breed,

1223
00:42:25,140 --> 00:42:26,240
 they can be.

1224
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:28,380
 And just to clarify, yeah, a Canadian goose

1225
00:42:28,380 --> 00:42:31,520
 should be a Canada goose, and gulls,

1226
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:34,160
 lots of different, 11 different types of gull in the UK.

1227
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:36,720
 And there is actually a Twitter account

1228
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:39,520
 called @NoSuchGull, which is about,

1229
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:41,800
 and the name is NoSuchThingAsAGull.

1230
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:45,400
 And it's kind of about how seagulls don't exist.

1231
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:47,120
 And so I don't really wanna slag off people

1232
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:48,000
 who are really pedantic about it

1233
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,320
 'cause they do actually follow QI

1234
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:51,000
 and retweeted us very recently.

1235
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,120
 In fact, yesterday.

1236
00:42:52,120 --> 00:42:54,240
 - I think the most fascinating thing about that fact is,

1237
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:55,800
 you were on Twitter.

1238
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:56,800
 (audience laughing)

1239
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:58,560
 - Yeah.

1240
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:00,480
 - I only go on for birdwatching updates.

1241
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:02,120
 (audience laughing)

1242
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:03,960
 - I can be hard though, being a birdwatcher.

1243
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:05,640
 I think we should cut them some slack.

1244
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:09,640
 In 2013, they found this amazing rare bird

1245
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:10,800
 on the island of Harris.

1246
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:13,040
 It was a white-throated needle tail.

1247
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:16,240
 Normally you'd only find it in Asia or in Australia,

1248
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:17,620
 but it was on the island of Harris,

1249
00:43:17,620 --> 00:43:20,520
 probably got caught on a draft of wind or something.

1250
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:23,200
 And so everyone suddenly got a message on their phones

1251
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:24,560
 or on their Twitter account saying,

1252
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:28,360
 "Guys, there is a white-throated needle tail on Harris."

1253
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:31,320
 And loads of people went up there to the island

1254
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:34,100
 all the way up in the north of Scotland to see this bird,

1255
00:43:34,100 --> 00:43:37,280
 which was then hit by a wind turd behind me.

1256
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:38,280
 - No.

1257
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:40,720
 - In front of all these birdwatchers.

1258
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:42,440
 - Oh.

1259
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:43,280
 - That's what it was going.

1260
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:45,080
 I've got an amazing updraft here.

1261
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:45,920
 Wow.

1262
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:48,280
 (audience laughing)

1263
00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:49,120
 - It does happen, doesn't it?

1264
00:43:49,120 --> 00:43:51,080
 I think there was a story that someone,

1265
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:52,520
 is it a pharaoh lope?

1266
00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:53,680
 There's a bird called a pharaoh lope, I think.

1267
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:54,640
 Does anyone know?

1268
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:56,860
 - Actually, it's a pharaoh lope.

1269
00:43:56,860 --> 00:43:58,480
 - I think it was something like a gray pharaoh lope,

1270
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:00,000
 and I'm going off memory, so I really can't remember it,

1271
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,920
 but it was, these birdwatchers had got to it,

1272
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:03,160
 and they were so excited about seeing it,

1273
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:05,080
 very rare in the area where they were,

1274
00:44:05,080 --> 00:44:09,320
 and then they saw a buzzard just arrive and land and eat it

1275
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:10,360
 right in front of them.

1276
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:12,360
 But then they did say, although the buzzards actually,

1277
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:13,880
 they're very rarely feed on that kind of prey,

1278
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:16,480
 so it kind of two birds with one stone, to be honest.

1279
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:17,320
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1280
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:19,800
 - They used that phrase, they used that phrase genuinely, yeah.

1281
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:21,800
 - Well, they're funny guys.

1282
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:24,560
 - Have you heard of other birdwatching slang?

1283
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:27,440
 This gets used in the birdwatching community.

1284
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:30,200
 Do you want to have a guess at what a not a bird is?

1285
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:31,480
 - Is it something that's not a bird?

1286
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:33,160
 - Something that's not a bird.

1287
00:44:33,160 --> 00:44:35,160
 It's something that looks like a bird from a distance,

1288
00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:37,400
 but once binoculars or a spotting scope is used,

1289
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:39,240
 turns out not to be a bird.

1290
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:41,880
 - Is it something that's either a plane or Superman?

1291
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:42,720
 - That's right.

1292
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:45,520
 (audience laughing)

1293
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:47,000
 - Have you heard of a pseudo bird?

1294
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,480
 - Sudo bird sounds like it's also a not a bird.

1295
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:51,560
 - Well, a pseudo bird is something that looks like a bird,

1296
00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:53,800
 and perhaps even moves like a bird,

1297
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:56,880
 until it is examined through binoculars or a spotting scope

1298
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:59,040
 and found to be something completely different.

1299
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:00,160
 (audience laughing)

1300
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:02,680
 - What is an example of a pseudo bird?

1301
00:45:02,680 --> 00:45:03,840
 - Like a bag of crisps.

1302
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:05,040
 - Bag of crisps.

1303
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:05,880
 - Very good.

1304
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:06,720
 - Wow, very good.

1305
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:08,200
 - You know, in the corner of the tree.

1306
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:10,040
 - This very much feels like sort of class one

1307
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:11,040
 of all anthology, doesn't it?

1308
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:12,440
 (audience laughing)

1309
00:45:12,440 --> 00:45:14,440
 Are you struggling to identify a bird?

1310
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:15,280
 - Yeah.

1311
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:16,120
 (audience laughing)

1312
00:45:16,120 --> 00:45:19,240
 Do you know what more slang, do you know what jizz is in it?

1313
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:20,600
 - Yes, let's move on.

1314
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:22,640
 - I see you read my blog then.

1315
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:25,640
 (audience laughing)

1316
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:30,240
 - Jizz is the sort of,

1317
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:32,400
 when you can't quite see what the bird is,

1318
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:35,440
 and you talk about the vibe of the bird,

1319
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:36,720
 like it's giving off this vibe,

1320
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:38,640
 so it must be this kind of bird.

1321
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:40,840
 - So it kind of, it moves a bit like a black bird,

1322
00:45:40,840 --> 00:45:42,440
 and it's kind of blackish,

1323
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:44,720
 and you think that probably is a black bird?

1324
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:45,560
 Is that what it is?

1325
00:45:45,560 --> 00:45:46,400
 - I think so, yes.

1326
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:48,040
 - It's basically the whole demeanour, isn't it, jizz?

1327
00:45:48,040 --> 00:45:50,480
 That bird's jizz is, well, it's tall, it's fat,

1328
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:51,760
 it's brown, it's--

1329
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:53,360
 - Wow, what is this bird?

1330
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:54,840
 - It's tall, it's fat, it's yellow,

1331
00:45:54,840 --> 00:45:56,040
 I'm watching Sesame Street.

1332
00:45:56,040 --> 00:45:59,040
 (audience laughing)

1333
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:03,280
 - It's been in use for a long time, though.

1334
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:06,560
 I think it even predates jizz as we know it today,

1335
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:08,960
 but there are rumors that it stands

1336
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:10,760
 for general impression, size, and shape,

1337
00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:12,760
 which was a military term in the Second World War,

1338
00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:15,720
 but it actually comes from before that, from 1922,

1339
00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:18,560
 and it now is spread to, like, all biologists,

1340
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:20,800
 you'll talk about plants jizz as well, which is--

1341
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:23,120
 - I like one etymology, I don't know if this is true either,

1342
00:46:23,120 --> 00:46:25,120
 but people say it just is.

1343
00:46:25,120 --> 00:46:26,200
 What is that bird?

1344
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:28,600
 Oh, it just, it just is, jizz.

1345
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:30,040
 - Feels to me like it comes from jist.

1346
00:46:30,040 --> 00:46:30,880
 Hey, what's the jist?

1347
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:33,080
 - Jist, yeah, that's better, isn't it?

1348
00:46:33,080 --> 00:46:36,000
 - Do you know what gripping someone off is in birdwatching?

1349
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:39,000
 (audience laughing)

1350
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,960
 - Well, it can get very exciting.

1351
00:46:41,960 --> 00:46:44,920
 - You've got to do something to pass to the air as well,

1352
00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:46,840
 waiting for the white-tailed needle thing,

1353
00:46:46,840 --> 00:46:50,440
 but gripping someone off is a bad thing to do

1354
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:52,800
 in birdwatching, it's where you see a bird

1355
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:54,520
 that someone else has missed out on,

1356
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:57,320
 and then you tell them about the bird that you've seen.

1357
00:46:57,320 --> 00:46:59,240
 So you'll sort of bragging to them,

1358
00:46:59,240 --> 00:47:00,680
 and you know that they've missed the opportunity

1359
00:47:00,680 --> 00:47:01,520
 to see this bird.

1360
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:02,360
 - Oh, really?

1361
00:47:02,360 --> 00:47:04,320
 - Yeah, yeah, and if someone's not noticed it,

1362
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:06,080
 maybe they were looking at it in the wrong place,

1363
00:47:06,080 --> 00:47:08,240
 or whatever, so that's a bad thing to do.

1364
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:10,880
 Don't grip off if you do go birdwatching.

1365
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:12,520
 - So you're just not allowed to share?

1366
00:47:12,520 --> 00:47:14,040
 If you see something cool, you're not allowed to,

1367
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:15,120
 you have to keep it secret in case

1368
00:47:15,120 --> 00:47:16,360
 someone gets upset they didn't see it.

1369
00:47:16,360 --> 00:47:17,960
 You're supposed to share,

1370
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:20,840
 but some asshole birdwatchers grip people off,

1371
00:47:20,840 --> 00:47:23,440
 and they're like, oh yeah, I saw it last week,

1372
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:24,280
 you're too late.

1373
00:47:24,280 --> 00:47:25,760
 I could have told you, but I didn't.

1374
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:27,280
 - Yeah, right.

1375
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:29,520
 - Just as it's disappearing down the buzzard's gullet,

1376
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:34,040
 you say, I've just seen a farolope, or whatever, yeah.

1377
00:47:34,040 --> 00:47:36,560
 - This fact was about the Audubon Society, right?

1378
00:47:36,560 --> 00:47:39,440
 The Bird Society, and he actually is an incredible

1379
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:42,120
 character from history, who was the first person

1380
00:47:42,120 --> 00:47:45,520
 to put together a sort of great collection of paintings

1381
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:48,560
 published in a book of the birds of America,

1382
00:47:48,560 --> 00:47:51,080
 and it's one of those rare books now

1383
00:47:51,080 --> 00:47:53,280
 that it basically outsells any book

1384
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:55,160
 in terms of price value at an auction,

1385
00:47:55,160 --> 00:47:59,120
 so a copy went a while ago for about 11 million,

1386
00:47:59,120 --> 00:48:00,240
 11 million.

1387
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:01,080
 - Yeah, it's--

1388
00:48:01,080 --> 00:48:02,720
 - We've got one in our house, no.

1389
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:03,760
 - An original?

1390
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:05,440
 - Oh, I don't know, okay, so it's not all of them

1391
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:06,280
 going for that.

1392
00:48:06,280 --> 00:48:08,600
 (audience laughs)

1393
00:48:08,600 --> 00:48:11,640
 - No, your Kindle PDF is not gonna be sold at Sotheby's.

1394
00:48:11,640 --> 00:48:15,040
 Have you noticed that every branch of Waterstones

1395
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:17,480
 has a massive safe in the middle of the shop floor?

1396
00:48:17,480 --> 00:48:18,920
 That's where they keep that book.

1397
00:48:18,920 --> 00:48:19,880
 - Yes.

1398
00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:21,160
 - I was just close to starting up

1399
00:48:21,160 --> 00:48:23,720
 and walking off the podcast, never to return.

1400
00:48:23,720 --> 00:48:24,880
 - Fuck you, guys!

1401
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:27,800
 (audience laughs)

1402
00:48:27,800 --> 00:48:28,640
 - Bye.

1403
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:32,760
 Sorry, so some versions are very expensive, yeah?

1404
00:48:32,760 --> 00:48:34,320
 - Yeah, so it's an amazing book,

1405
00:48:34,320 --> 00:48:35,720
 and he used to paint these birds,

1406
00:48:35,720 --> 00:48:39,440
 and it used to be a bit more of a vicious bird spotting thing.

1407
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:41,360
 These days, the idea, I think, of hurting a bird

1408
00:48:41,360 --> 00:48:44,040
 in any way would be horrible back then,

1409
00:48:44,040 --> 00:48:45,640
 in order to paint the bird and spot them,

1410
00:48:45,640 --> 00:48:46,720
 you actually had to kill them,

1411
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:49,480
 so he used to go around and he would shoot birds,

1412
00:48:49,480 --> 00:48:51,160
 and then what he would do is he would put

1413
00:48:51,160 --> 00:48:53,280
 sort of wires onto them and pose them

1414
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:56,120
 as if they were mid-flight so that he could capture them

1415
00:48:56,120 --> 00:48:58,560
 as if they were in the nature and they were alive,

1416
00:48:58,560 --> 00:49:00,160
 which is very different to any kind of drawing

1417
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:02,920
 at that time, it was usually very posed and very still.

1418
00:49:02,920 --> 00:49:04,840
 So he kind of, he did that brilliantly,

1419
00:49:04,840 --> 00:49:06,640
 but the other amazing thing is this book,

1420
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:08,680
 the original book, how tall is your book?

1421
00:49:08,680 --> 00:49:10,160
 - It's about this big, it's big.

1422
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:11,760
 - It's a big book, and the original,

1423
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:13,640
 the idea was he wanted to capture the birds

1424
00:49:13,640 --> 00:49:15,560
 in their full size, so when you saw it,

1425
00:49:15,560 --> 00:49:18,120
 it was almost as if you were in front of one.

1426
00:49:18,120 --> 00:49:19,440
 Yeah, but what's really wonderful is

1427
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:22,120
 he slightly miscalculated the size of some of the birds,

1428
00:49:22,120 --> 00:49:24,200
 so in some of them, they've had to be contorted

1429
00:49:24,200 --> 00:49:29,200
 to sort of fit to the page, like squish down with wings.

1430
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:31,880
 Yeah, but yeah, really fascinating character.

1431
00:49:31,880 --> 00:49:33,680
 - He was, do you know how he made his living

1432
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:36,400
 before he got into the bird drawing business?

1433
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:37,840
 Or in fact, as like, you know,

1434
00:49:37,840 --> 00:49:39,200
 while he was drawing birds as a hobby,

1435
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:41,480
 he made his money as a death bed artist,

1436
00:49:41,480 --> 00:49:45,000
 so that's someone who, if someone you love dies,

1437
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,600
 you go, oh my God, we forgot to get a portrait of them,

1438
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:49,320
 we'd better get one now, and you went

1439
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:51,000
 and you would paint a portrait of a dead person

1440
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:54,080
 of the corpse, and it would be lying in repose

1441
00:49:54,080 --> 00:49:56,440
 with maybe a bunch of flowers or photograph or something.

1442
00:49:56,440 --> 00:49:59,000
 - But would he pose them like he later did the birds,

1443
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,040
 as in with wires and with--

1444
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:05,240
 - Absolutely, yeah, doing the high jump or backflip.

1445
00:50:05,240 --> 00:50:06,560
 However you wanted it.

1446
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:11,800
 - Have you guys heard of Phoebe Snetsinger?

1447
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:13,120
 Phoebe Snetsinger's amazing.

1448
00:50:13,120 --> 00:50:18,040
 So she, in 1981, was diagnosed with terminal cancer

1449
00:50:18,040 --> 00:50:20,960
 and decided that instead of going into a home

1450
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:22,800
 and just kind of succumbing to it,

1451
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:25,160
 she decided, well, I've not got much time left,

1452
00:50:25,160 --> 00:50:26,920
 so I'm gonna go and look for birds.

1453
00:50:26,920 --> 00:50:30,040
 Okay, and she took a trip to Alaska to look for birds,

1454
00:50:30,040 --> 00:50:32,400
 and she kept looking for birds and kept looking for birds,

1455
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:34,760
 and luckily enough got into remission

1456
00:50:34,760 --> 00:50:36,160
 and kept looking for birds,

1457
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:37,680
 and she was the first person to see

1458
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:41,040
 more than 8,000 species of birds ever,

1459
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:43,120
 and when she died, eventually,

1460
00:50:43,120 --> 00:50:46,400
 she'd seen 8,398 birds,

1461
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:51,200
 which was 85% of the known species in the world she'd seen.

1462
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:52,040
 Isn't that amazing?

1463
00:50:52,040 --> 00:50:52,880
 - Wow!

1464
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:54,200
 - So good.

1465
00:50:54,200 --> 00:50:56,440
 We're gonna have to wrap up soon, guys.

1466
00:50:56,440 --> 00:50:58,880
 Yeah, no, we are, but we are.

1467
00:50:58,880 --> 00:50:59,760
 - No, yes.

1468
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:02,800
 - But I haven't told you about Graham Moss yet.

1469
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:03,640
 - Right.

1470
00:51:03,640 --> 00:51:04,760
 - You've hooked me, go for it.

1471
00:51:04,760 --> 00:51:06,000
 (audience laughing)

1472
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:07,880
 - This is a bird watching story from this year,

1473
00:51:07,880 --> 00:51:09,680
 and it's just a rather nice one.

1474
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:11,720
 It's Doncaster Baby Owl webcam,

1475
00:51:11,720 --> 00:51:15,160
 banned by Facebook over sex and nudity rule.

1476
00:51:15,160 --> 00:51:20,160
 So, this summer, a man in Doncaster called Graham Moss,

1477
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:22,880
 he set up a very sweet webcam of some baby owls

1478
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:23,920
 in their nest, and just--

1479
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:25,600
 - So were you looking at Moss News?

1480
00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:26,680
 - You were, weren't you?

1481
00:51:26,680 --> 00:51:29,120
 (audience laughing)

1482
00:51:29,120 --> 00:51:30,280
 - This is a complete coincidence,

1483
00:51:30,280 --> 00:51:31,560
 although there is a book about bird watching

1484
00:51:31,560 --> 00:51:33,080
 by someone called Stephen Moss.

1485
00:51:33,080 --> 00:51:34,640
 - All right, you've been looking at Moss News.

1486
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:36,880
 - And fortunately, it's coincided with the research

1487
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:38,560
 for today, but you got lucky.

1488
00:51:38,560 --> 00:51:41,040
 - But it got, his webcam was taken down twice

1489
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:42,800
 'cause it breached the community guidelines

1490
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:45,440
 on adult nudity and sexual activity.

1491
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:46,400
 - But what was happening?

1492
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:47,220
 - Nothing, nothing was happening.

1493
00:51:47,220 --> 00:51:50,560
 It was just some baby owls, but either algorithmically,

1494
00:51:50,560 --> 00:51:51,400
 it saw the sort of--

1495
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:52,320
 - Algorithmically?

1496
00:51:52,320 --> 00:51:54,360
 - There we go.

1497
00:51:54,360 --> 00:51:56,200
 (audience laughing)

1498
00:51:56,200 --> 00:51:58,360
 - No one's seeing this outside the street, but I--

1499
00:51:58,360 --> 00:52:00,320
 (audience laughing)

1500
00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:02,080
 - But yeah, it always thinks he was pranked,

1501
00:52:02,080 --> 00:52:04,160
 but I think it's possible that algorithmically,

1502
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:07,600
 someone would see some sort of writhing flesh in a nest.

1503
00:52:07,600 --> 00:52:09,480
 - You think that looks rude?

1504
00:52:09,480 --> 00:52:10,760
 - Were they featherless?

1505
00:52:10,760 --> 00:52:11,600
 - Were they naked?

1506
00:52:11,600 --> 00:52:12,440
 - Well, they were baby owls,

1507
00:52:12,440 --> 00:52:14,560
 so I think they probably would have been very feathered.

1508
00:52:14,560 --> 00:52:16,880
 - Yeah, you can get in trouble with things like that.

1509
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:20,840
 The Christmas Island tourist board went onto Facebook

1510
00:52:20,840 --> 00:52:24,000
 to advertise the island's annual Burden Nature Week

1511
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,360
 with the headline, "Some gorgeous shots here

1512
00:52:26,360 --> 00:52:28,480
 "of some juvenile boobies."

1513
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:29,880
 - Oh, fuck.

1514
00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:30,720
 - No.

1515
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:33,280
 - And Facebook, for some reason, took them down.

1516
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:35,320
 (audience laughing)

1517
00:52:35,320 --> 00:52:37,520
 And they appealed to Facebook, saying,

1518
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:38,680
 "Charlie, some mistake.

1519
00:52:38,680 --> 00:52:40,040
 "We're just talking about this bird,

1520
00:52:40,040 --> 00:52:42,560
 "which is called a boobie," and Facebook went, "Nope."

1521
00:52:42,560 --> 00:52:43,880
 (audience laughing)

1522
00:52:43,880 --> 00:52:44,840
 - That's kind of fair.

1523
00:52:44,840 --> 00:52:47,840
 - I read there was an interview, Birdwatch Ireland,

1524
00:52:47,840 --> 00:52:50,200
 there was a member called Niall Hatch,

1525
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:53,800
 and the person interviewing just got so excited

1526
00:52:53,800 --> 00:52:54,840
 that he was called Hatch,

1527
00:52:54,840 --> 00:52:57,360
 that he derailed the conversation in order to say,

1528
00:52:57,360 --> 00:52:58,640
 "Oh, that's funny, isn't it?"

1529
00:52:58,640 --> 00:53:01,080
 And then he turned out, he said,

1530
00:53:01,080 --> 00:53:03,360
 "It's actually not as sort of uncommon

1531
00:53:03,360 --> 00:53:05,600
 "to have a bird-related name for members

1532
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:07,240
 "of the Birdwatch Ireland.

1533
00:53:07,240 --> 00:53:08,720
 "It's a bit more common."

1534
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:10,360
 So he then listed off a bunch of people

1535
00:53:10,360 --> 00:53:12,800
 that were past and present people as part of it.

1536
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:15,160
 So we had Donald Finch,

1537
00:53:15,160 --> 00:53:18,680
 Ashlyn Tallinn, Steven Wing, Dave Bird.

1538
00:53:18,680 --> 00:53:19,880
 (audience laughing)

1539
00:53:19,880 --> 00:53:21,320
 Bit on the nose, Dave.

1540
00:53:21,320 --> 00:53:23,080
 (audience laughing)

1541
00:53:23,080 --> 00:53:25,720
 - That is so a fake name, isn't it?

1542
00:53:25,720 --> 00:53:26,920
 (audience laughing)

1543
00:53:26,920 --> 00:53:27,840
 - Look at Ms. Tallinn over here.

1544
00:53:27,840 --> 00:53:29,440
 She's picked a part of the bird.

1545
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:30,760
 (audience laughing)

1546
00:53:30,760 --> 00:53:31,600
 - Dave Bird.

1547
00:53:31,600 --> 00:53:32,920
 - Dave Bird.

1548
00:53:32,920 --> 00:53:33,760
 - Yeah.

1549
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:34,600
 - Anyone else?

1550
00:53:34,600 --> 00:53:36,360
 - There's Mark Robbins.

1551
00:53:36,360 --> 00:53:38,880
 - See, Mark's picked a species of bird.

1552
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:40,320
 Not like you, Dave.

1553
00:53:40,320 --> 00:53:42,720
 - Olivia Crow.

1554
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:43,560
 - And yeah.

1555
00:53:43,560 --> 00:53:45,560
 - Mark, do you think sometimes people

1556
00:53:45,560 --> 00:53:48,240
 in Birdwatching societies go, "Mark, Robbins."

1557
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:49,160
 (audience laughing)

1558
00:53:49,160 --> 00:53:50,680
 Just saying, "Look, Robbins."

1559
00:53:50,680 --> 00:53:52,480
 - Do you think they go, "Dave, bird?"

1560
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:55,640
 (audience laughing)

1561
00:53:55,640 --> 00:53:56,640
 - I've got one last thing.

1562
00:53:56,640 --> 00:53:59,520
 Just on the subject of being pedantic and bird-splaining,

1563
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:02,760
 we've actually had, I've been sent a WhatsApp message

1564
00:54:02,760 --> 00:54:05,920
 by Alex Bell, who is one of the fish team.

1565
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:07,640
 He just wants me to pass this on to Anna.

1566
00:54:07,640 --> 00:54:11,040
 Anna's Gull Twitter thing is @NoSuchSeagull,

1567
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:13,200
 not @NoSuchGulls.

1568
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:15,040
 (audience laughing)

1569
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:17,360
 - And I think we now know who runs that account.

1570
00:54:17,360 --> 00:54:20,360
 (audience laughing)

1571
00:54:20,360 --> 00:54:22,680
 - Okay, that's it.

1572
00:54:22,680 --> 00:54:23,920
 That is all of our facts.

1573
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:25,480
 Thank you so much for listening.

00:54:25,480 --> 00:54:27,360
 If you'd like to get in contact with any of us

1575
