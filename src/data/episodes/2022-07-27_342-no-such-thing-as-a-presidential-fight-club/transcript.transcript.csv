00:00:00,00:00:02,"Hey everyone, welcome to this week's episode of Fish."
00:00:02,00:00:04,I just want to let you know that the episode
00:00:04,00:00:06,you're about to listen to was recorded live
00:00:06,00:00:09,at the London Podcast Festival at King's Place
00:00:09,00:00:12,and that it was recorded just a few weeks ago.
00:00:12,00:00:15,"That's right, we actually managed to do a live gig"
00:00:15,00:00:16,in the year 2020.
00:00:16,00:00:18,It was such a fun night.
00:00:18,00:00:20,It was actually the first time that the four of us
00:00:20,00:00:21,had been in a room together
00:00:21,00:00:22,since this whole pandemic kicked off.
00:00:22,00:00:24,It's about seven months.
00:00:24,00:00:25,So that was incredibly fun.
00:00:25,00:00:27,It was amazing to see some of the fish listeners
00:00:27,00:00:29,"sitting out there in the audience,"
00:00:29,00:00:31,"all sitting there with their masks on,"
00:00:31,00:00:32,spread out around the auditorium
00:00:32,00:00:34,"so that we could make sure everyone was nicely,"
00:00:34,00:00:36,socially distanced from each other.
00:00:36,00:00:38,And so big thank you to them.
00:00:38,00:00:40,Big thank you to everyone who joined us online
00:00:40,00:00:41,to watch it as it streamed.
00:00:41,00:00:44,It was our first ever global gig as a result.
00:00:44,00:00:46,"And most importantly, a big thank you"
00:00:46,00:00:47,to the staff at King's Place
00:00:47,00:00:51,who made sure everyone felt safe going ahead with this gig.
00:00:51,00:00:52,"So yeah, we hope you enjoy it."
00:00:52,00:00:54,"It's our first gig of the year,"
00:00:54,00:00:56,"possibly our last, hopefully not."
00:00:56,00:01:00,"But here it is, live in London in the year 2020."
00:01:00,00:01:01,Enjoy.
00:01:01,00:01:18,Hello and welcome to another episode
00:01:18,00:01:19,"of No Such Thing as a Fish,"
00:01:19,00:01:22,a weekly podcast this week coming to you live
00:01:22,00:01:24,from the London Podcast Festival.
00:01:24,00:01:27,(audience cheering)
00:01:27,00:01:34,My name is Dan Shriver.
00:01:34,00:01:37,"I'm sitting here with Anna Tachinsky,"
00:01:37,00:01:39,Andrew Hunter Murray and James Harkin.
00:01:39,00:01:41,"And once again, we have gathered around the microphones"
00:01:41,00:01:44,with our four favorite facts from the last seven days.
00:01:44,00:01:47,"And in no particular order, here we go."
00:01:47,00:01:49,"Starting with my fact this week,"
00:01:49,00:01:51,my fact is that Theodore Roosevelt
00:01:51,00:01:54,once was shot in the chest but survived
00:01:54,00:01:58,thanks to a 50 page long speech tucked into his coat pocket.
00:01:58,00:02:01,He delivered the speech reading from pages
00:02:01,00:02:04,that now had two massive bullet holes in them.
00:02:04,00:02:06,Wow.
00:02:06,00:02:09,And he did a speech which lasted about 90 minutes.
00:02:09,00:02:10,Wow.
00:02:10,00:02:12,"And that's where the idea of bullet points came from,"
00:02:12,00:02:13,isn't it?
00:02:13,00:02:17,"Come on, it's been seven months."
00:02:17,00:02:20,(audience cheering)
00:02:20,00:02:21,"Yeah, this happened in 1912."
00:02:21,00:02:23,He was in Milwaukee.
00:02:23,00:02:25,He was on his way to the Milwaukee Auditorium
00:02:25,00:02:27,and he was in an open top car.
00:02:27,00:02:28,"And as he was standing up to wave,"
00:02:28,00:02:30,a gunman who was called John Shrank
00:02:30,00:02:33,"shot him in the chest, basically at point blank range."
00:02:33,00:02:36,And the bullet still went into his body
00:02:36,00:02:38,and was lodged inside his body.
00:02:38,00:02:39,"But rather than go to the hospital,"
00:02:39,00:02:41,"he said, ""I'll just quickly do my 90 minute speech."""
00:02:41,00:02:44,"And you can actually see if you go online,"
00:02:44,00:02:47,they have in a museum the pages of this speech.
00:02:47,00:02:48,"And when I say massive bullet holes,"
00:02:48,00:02:51,"they are ginormous, these two ginormous bullet holes."
00:02:51,00:02:52,"But yeah, he was a badass like that."
00:02:52,00:02:54,"He was a badass, like, to make sure"
00:02:54,00:02:56,"that it hadn't penetrated his lungs,"
00:02:56,00:02:58,he coughed into his hand three times
00:02:58,00:03:00,and checked for blood to make sure
00:03:00,00:03:02,that he didn't have to go to hospital.
00:03:02,00:03:03,"That's pretty hard car, isn't it?"
00:03:03,00:03:06,All of his aides were sort of standing around
00:03:06,00:03:07,'cause they were quite nervous about this.
00:03:07,00:03:09,They thought he should go to hospital.
00:03:09,00:03:11,"Lots of the crowd, he announced right at the start,"
00:03:11,00:03:13,"he said, ""Friends, I should ask you to be"
00:03:13,00:03:14,"""as quiet as possible."
00:03:14,00:03:15,"""I don't know whether you fully understand"
00:03:15,00:03:17,"""that I have just been shot."""
00:03:17,00:03:19,"And so people were standing around,"
00:03:19,00:03:20,it's sort of ready to catch him
00:03:20,00:03:21,"at the side of the stage, basically."
00:03:21,00:03:22,And he kept glaring at them
00:03:22,00:03:25,and he refused to even cut it short.
00:03:25,00:03:26,- Did he not have to miss out the odd word
00:03:26,00:03:28,that the bullet holes had gone through?
00:03:28,00:03:29,"- Oh, yeah."
00:03:29,00:03:32,"- It actually didn't make any sense at all, the speech."
00:03:32,00:03:34,"- Yeah, it kind of came out as like a redacted speech"
00:03:34,00:03:36,that he wasn't giving us all the info on.
00:03:36,00:03:37,- Did you guys see this?
00:03:37,00:03:39,"This allegedly happened when he announced,"
00:03:39,00:03:40,"by the way, I've just been shot right at the top"
00:03:40,00:03:43,before he got into the actual stuff that was on his pages.
00:03:43,00:03:44,"Apparently, when he said that,"
00:03:44,00:03:46,"someone in the crowd shouted, ""Fake."""
00:03:46,00:03:48,(laughing)
00:03:48,00:03:52,"- Well, I didn't know Donald Trump was alive back then."
00:03:52,00:03:53,"- Supposedly, he stepped forward and said,"
00:03:53,00:03:56,"""No, no, it's real, here's my beanie shirt."""
00:03:56,00:04:00,"- The guy had to come up and put his finger in the hole to me, too."
00:04:00,00:04:01,"- They left the bullet in, didn't they?"
00:04:01,00:04:02,"Forever and ever, I think,"
00:04:02,00:04:04,"'cause it was too dangerous to extract it,"
00:04:04,00:04:06,so just kept it in forever.
00:04:06,00:04:08,"But he sent a telegram to his wife,"
00:04:08,00:04:09,"I think, straight after giving the speech,"
00:04:09,00:04:10,he dictated a telegram to her
00:04:10,00:04:12,"when he was on his way to hospital saying,"
00:04:12,00:04:15,"""He was in excellent shape and he just had a little injury,"
00:04:15,00:04:17,"""no more serious than one of the trivial injuries"
00:04:17,00:04:19,"""that kids were always getting."""
00:04:19,00:04:21,(laughing)
00:04:21,00:04:25,Their children were neglected is what I've read into that.
00:04:25,00:04:27,It is one of those things that makes you understand
00:04:27,00:04:29,"why there are generations who say,"
00:04:29,00:04:31,"""Oh, they don't make the might they used to."""
00:04:31,00:04:34,"You can't imagine the, you know, us snowflakes standing there"
00:04:34,00:04:36,and delivering a 90-minute podcast
00:04:36,00:04:37,with bullet holes through our chests.
00:04:37,00:04:41,"I wouldn't do it, I'm not gonna lie."
00:04:41,00:04:42,"- Yeah, it's very weird."
00:04:42,00:04:43,"I mean, what was interesting about him was,"
00:04:43,00:04:46,he was very much into physical exertion.
00:04:46,00:04:48,He was in pushing his body all the time
00:04:48,00:04:49,to sort of be the strongest he can be.
00:04:49,00:04:52,There's accounts of him where he would hang a wire
00:04:52,00:04:54,"over a river and it would be a fast flowing,"
00:04:54,00:04:56,very dangerous river with currents
00:04:56,00:04:58,and he would just hang on the rope
00:04:58,00:05:00,just to bring his body strength better.
00:05:00,00:05:03,But like the risk of if he'd fallen into the water
00:05:03,00:05:04,would be possible drowning
00:05:04,00:05:06,and he was just like always on the edge.
00:05:06,00:05:09,"- Well, do you know that's because he was brought up that way."
00:05:09,00:05:12,His parents were something called muscular Christians.
00:05:12,00:05:13,- What?
00:05:13,00:05:16,That sounds so cool.
00:05:16,00:05:19,"- It sounds half-cool, doesn't it?"
00:05:19,00:05:21,"- Oh, they worship at the church"
00:05:21,00:05:24,"of our blessed lady of the six pack, don't they?"
00:05:24,00:05:26,"Yeah, yeah, what is a muscular Christian?"
00:05:26,00:05:28,- It's pretty much exactly what it sounds like.
00:05:28,00:05:30,So the idea was to be a good Christian.
00:05:30,00:05:32,You had to kind of look after your body
00:05:32,00:05:33,and be really muscular.
00:05:33,00:05:35,"It was quite, I wouldn't say misogynistic,"
00:05:35,00:05:36,but it was of its time.
00:05:36,00:05:38,Like it was basically men should be strong
00:05:38,00:05:41,and they should look after the women kind of thing.
00:05:41,00:05:43,And it was quite popular in America at the time.
00:05:43,00:05:46,"And according to Wikipedia, I read this verbatim,"
00:05:46,00:05:49,it said muscular Christianity spread to other countries
00:05:49,00:05:50,in the 19th century.
00:05:50,00:05:54,"It was well-entrenched in Australian society by 1860,"
00:05:54,00:05:56,though not always with much recognition
00:05:56,00:05:57,of the religious elements.
00:05:57,00:06:00,(audience laughing)
00:06:00,00:06:03,"Simon, that explains quite a lot, doesn't it?"
00:06:03,00:06:07,"- But he was quite a wimp initially, wasn't he, Teddy?"
00:06:07,00:06:09,"In his childhood, he was, well, a wimp is harsh."
00:06:09,00:06:11,He had asthma.
00:06:11,00:06:12,So...
00:06:12,00:06:13,(audience laughing)
00:06:13,00:06:15,"- That tells you a lot about Anna in the school yard,"
00:06:15,00:06:16,doesn't it?
00:06:16,00:06:17,(audience laughing)
00:06:17,00:06:19,- I had a very specific role in the playground.
00:06:19,00:06:21,(audience laughing)
00:06:21,00:06:22,"No, he had a really difficult childhood."
00:06:22,00:06:24,"He had really bad asthma and he was,"
00:06:24,00:06:26,he described himself as quite sickly and quite weak.
00:06:26,00:06:28,And he got beaten up as a teenager
00:06:28,00:06:30,and found he couldn't defend himself.
00:06:30,00:06:32,And so he demanded boxing lessons from his dad
00:06:32,00:06:35,and got them and he devoted himself completely
00:06:35,00:06:37,to becoming someone who was able to beat the bullies
00:06:37,00:06:38,in the future. - Yeah.
00:06:38,00:06:39,"- And yeah, it was hardcore."
00:06:39,00:06:42,There's lots of sources that say he was the first American
00:06:42,00:06:44,"to get a brown belt in Judo,"
00:06:44,00:06:46,"which, like a lot of his biographies claim,"
00:06:46,00:06:47,he was certainly very good at Judo.
00:06:47,00:06:49,"- What's brown, definitely, is below black, right?"
00:06:49,00:06:50,"- It's below black, yeah."
00:06:50,00:06:53,"- That's not, like, the greatest boast."
00:06:53,00:06:55,"- It's the one below black, okay?"
00:06:55,00:06:58,Just 'cause brown's a bit of a yucky color.
00:06:58,00:06:59,"- No, it's just, but then black just has, like,"
00:06:59,00:07:01,"these extra, like, first and second down."
00:07:01,00:07:02,"Like, black goes on, it's fine."
00:07:02,00:07:03,We'll talk later.
00:07:03,00:07:05,"- All right, Dan, you come back to me"
00:07:05,00:07:06,when you've got a black belt in Judo.
00:07:06,00:07:09,"- I have one in Taekwondo, I'll have you know."
00:07:09,00:07:11,"- Second Dan, yeah. - Oh, yeah, you do."
00:07:11,00:07:12,- That's great.
00:07:12,00:07:14,- There were two Dan's in the class with that.
00:07:14,00:07:17,(audience laughing)
00:07:17,00:07:20,"- He, I think as well,"
00:07:20,00:07:22,"I think he had mega anger issues as well,"
00:07:22,00:07:25,because he wouldn't let something go.
00:07:25,00:07:27,There was a story that happened in 1886.
00:07:27,00:07:29,"We still have second Danning, is that what's going on?"
00:07:29,00:07:33,"- Sorry, I'm just laughing at my own joke over here."
00:07:33,00:07:35,(audience laughing)
00:07:35,00:07:36,- So good to see you again.
00:07:36,00:07:38,(audience laughing)
00:07:38,00:07:42,"- Yeah, so 1886, Roosevelt, his boat was stolen"
00:07:42,00:07:45,"by these two thieves, and they took the boat"
00:07:45,00:07:46,and they started riding it away.
00:07:46,00:07:48,"And rather than letting it go, he was like,"
00:07:48,00:07:51,"""No, I'm gonna chase them, and I'm gonna get it back."""
00:07:51,00:07:53,And he knew that they had such a head start
00:07:53,00:07:55,that this would take days.
00:07:55,00:07:56,"So he was like, ""Screw it, I'm doing it anyway."""
00:07:56,00:07:58,So he decided to do it.
00:07:58,00:07:59,And this is how preparative he was.
00:07:59,00:08:02,He took food that he wanted to take in pursuit.
00:08:02,00:08:04,"He also took a copy of Anna Karenina,"
00:08:04,00:08:05,"because he thought, ""Oh."""
00:08:05,00:08:07,- It's hard to protect him from the next bullet.
00:08:07,00:08:09,(audience laughing)
00:08:09,00:08:11,"- Yeah, no, I think it was downtime"
00:08:11,00:08:13,"that he was like, ""Just gonna bring a bullet."""
00:08:13,00:08:14,"- Anna Karenina, that's Tolstoy, isn't it?"
00:08:14,00:08:15,- Yeah.
00:08:15,00:08:17,"- Yeah, so he was effectively a cowboy"
00:08:17,00:08:19,for some of his pre-presidency life.
00:08:19,00:08:21,"And he, I think this may have been the same incident,"
00:08:21,00:08:23,but he was chasing outlaws.
00:08:23,00:08:25,I don't know if he was kind of a deputy sheriff
00:08:25,00:08:27,"or a deputy marshal, something like that."
00:08:27,00:08:29,He was chasing three outlaws at one point.
00:08:29,00:08:30,He caught them.
00:08:30,00:08:32,He then had to watch them for 40 hours
00:08:32,00:08:34,when he was sort of bringing them in.
00:08:34,00:08:37,And he kept himself awake by reading Tolstoy.
00:08:37,00:08:38,"- Yeah, that was it."
00:08:38,00:08:40,He was reading and he was holding his shotgun
00:08:40,00:08:42,over the kind of bad guys.
00:08:42,00:08:44,He was reading like this. - No way.
00:08:44,00:08:48,- And he finished Anna Karenina halfway through the 40 hours
00:08:48,00:08:49,"and he was like, ""Well, what am I gonna do now?"""
00:08:49,00:08:51,And one of the outlaws had a book
00:08:51,00:08:52,"and he said, ""Give me your book."""
00:08:52,00:08:53,And he started reading his book.
00:08:53,00:08:56,"- Oh, what's so funny?"
00:08:56,00:08:58,Did he read it to them?
00:08:58,00:08:59,- I don't think so.
00:08:59,00:09:01,- Was it like Theodore Roosevelt's
00:09:01,00:09:02,lethal audio book time?
00:09:02,00:09:03,Or was it?
00:09:03,00:09:06,"- Yeah, 'cause Anna Karenina loses her head at the end."
00:09:06,00:09:07,"Maybe he was like, ""This is what's gonna happen to you."""
00:09:07,00:09:09,- Wow. - And spoiler.
00:09:09,00:09:10,- I cannot let you--
00:09:10,00:09:12,- If you haven't read Anna Karenina dead by then.
00:09:12,00:09:14,"- She loses her head, either metaphorically or literally."
00:09:14,00:09:18,"We won't specify which, but it involves a train."
00:09:18,00:09:22,"- There is no one, there is no one listening to our podcast"
00:09:22,00:09:23,that has not read Anna Karenina.
00:09:23,00:09:24,- I actually can't believe you just did that.
00:09:24,00:09:26,I think we've just lost all the online listeners
00:09:26,00:09:28,and some people at the back have walked out.
00:09:28,00:09:30,"And also, I don't think she's not leaning over"
00:09:30,00:09:31,to vomit on the railway.
00:09:31,00:09:33,The train doesn't knock her head off
00:09:33,00:09:34,as far as I remember.
00:09:34,00:09:36,It's just a full on death by train
00:09:36,00:09:37,if we are really revealing the ending.
00:09:37,00:09:41,"- I think we've committed now, so yeah, go for it."
00:09:41,00:09:42,I think it's amazing.
00:09:42,00:09:44,It's a thing that's sort of not attached
00:09:44,00:09:46,to 19th century outlaw folktales
00:09:46,00:09:49,that there's always a sort of break to read a book
00:09:49,00:09:50,during a chase.
00:09:50,00:09:51,- Always carry a book.
00:09:51,00:09:52,- Everyone's got a book on them.
00:09:52,00:09:53,How cool is that?
00:09:53,00:09:54,- It's the outlaw code.
00:09:54,00:09:56,"- Yeah, I just wonder what the outlaws book was."
00:09:56,00:09:57,'Cause it can't have been more Tolstoy.
00:09:57,00:09:59,What are the odds of them having--
00:09:59,00:10:00,- Unlikely.
00:10:00,00:10:01,- It's probably something really--
00:10:01,00:10:02,- How to steal a boat.
00:10:02,00:10:09,- He had cowboy practice actually when he was a kid.
00:10:09,00:10:11,His parents used to stick him on a horse
00:10:11,00:10:12,or in a carriage just behind a horse
00:10:12,00:10:15,and make the horse gallop at breakneck speed
00:10:15,00:10:17,as fast as it possibly could with his mouth open.
00:10:17,00:10:19,"Not the horse, Teddy with his mouth open."
00:10:19,00:10:21,'Cause they thought that would cure his asthma.
00:10:21,00:10:22,- No.
00:10:22,00:10:23,- Really?
00:10:23,00:10:25,- It doesn't feel like that would work.
00:10:25,00:10:25,- Well.
00:10:25,00:10:28,"- Look, have you tried it?"
00:10:28,00:10:30,- I'm not a doctor.
00:10:30,00:10:32,"- But didn't Thomas Jefferson tried to,"
00:10:32,00:10:34,and I think thought he successfully cured his diarrhea
00:10:34,00:10:36,by horseback riding.
00:10:36,00:10:38,- That feels like that would cure your constipation
00:10:38,00:10:39,rather than your diarrhea.
00:10:39,00:10:40,"- Yeah, you would think right."
00:10:40,00:10:42,"Yeah, but maybe it floods it out."
00:10:42,00:10:44,- Yeah.
00:10:44,00:10:46,- But you put asthma sufferers on the carriage behind him
00:10:46,00:10:48,and that's two birds one stone.
00:10:48,00:10:51,- I just love all these old horse prescriptions.
00:10:51,00:10:53,Get on a horse and yeah.
00:10:53,00:10:56,- Theodore Roosevelt kind of invented piranhas.
00:10:56,00:10:59,- Wow.
00:10:59,00:11:03,"- Interesting, he, and I stand by this, so."
00:11:03,00:11:04,"- Wait, I know what's happened."
00:11:04,00:11:06,"Andy, you've got my notes."
00:11:06,00:11:07,Sorry.
00:11:07,00:11:09,"- No, he did, he genuinely did."
00:11:09,00:11:11,"So he wrote a book, I think it was in about 1913."
00:11:11,00:11:13,So he'd already been president by this point
00:11:13,00:11:14,and he'd been shot and everything.
00:11:14,00:11:16,"But he was, he did lots of expeditions"
00:11:16,00:11:17,and big game hunting and all of this.
00:11:17,00:11:19,He wrote this book through the Brazilian wilderness
00:11:19,00:11:22,and in it he has this long bit describing
00:11:22,00:11:24,these ferocious piranhas that you get in the Amazon
00:11:24,00:11:27,and how they can strip a cow's flesh from its bones
00:11:27,00:11:29,in a few minutes.
00:11:29,00:11:32,And he said that they will snap a finger off a hand
00:11:32,00:11:34,in cautiously trailed in the water.
00:11:34,00:11:36,I never witnessed an exhibition
00:11:36,00:11:38,of such impotent savage fury.
00:11:38,00:11:40,"So that's all, it's basically all thanks to him."
00:11:40,00:11:43,"But the reason, I mean piranhas don't do that"
00:11:43,00:11:46,"unless they're really, unless it's really dry"
00:11:46,00:11:47,and they're really crammed in together
00:11:47,00:11:50,"and they're really, really hungry."
00:11:50,00:11:51,"Some of them are vegetarian, for example."
00:11:51,00:11:52,But.
00:11:52,00:11:53,(audience laughs)
00:11:53,00:11:55,- The ethical piranhas.
00:11:55,00:11:57,There are more and more of them.
00:11:57,00:11:59,"But they reckon that maybe, this is just a theory,"
00:11:59,00:12:01,that when he was visiting the area
00:12:01,00:12:03,where he saw this kind of exhibition display
00:12:03,00:12:05,"of piranha activity, it's because his hosts"
00:12:05,00:12:07,"had blocked off a bit of the river,"
00:12:07,00:12:09,"chucked a load of piranhas in there,"
00:12:09,00:12:11,"let it dry out, not fed them at all."
00:12:11,00:12:12,"And so by the time the Roosevelt arrived,"
00:12:12,00:12:14,"they were really, really, really ready to eat."
00:12:14,00:12:16,That's what made it like that.
00:12:16,00:12:18,- And are you saying he invented the piranha
00:12:18,00:12:20,because he sort of invented our idea
00:12:20,00:12:22,of the piranha as a very vicious animal?
00:12:22,00:12:22,- Yeah.
00:12:22,00:12:23,- That's fair.
00:12:23,00:12:24,- I see.
00:12:24,00:12:25,"It's half fair, yeah."
00:12:25,00:12:27,(audience laughs)
00:12:27,00:12:28,He was a tough boss.
00:12:28,00:12:30,"Given that he was a tough man,"
00:12:30,00:12:32,"he kind of expected the same from his cabinet, for instance."
00:12:32,00:12:34,"He had this thing called the tennis cabinet,"
00:12:34,00:12:38,which was initially started as a way of him exercising
00:12:38,00:12:40,with all his kind of younger employees.
00:12:40,00:12:41,And so his younger ministers would go out
00:12:41,00:12:42,and play tennis with him.
00:12:42,00:12:43,And he thought tennis actually was really dull
00:12:43,00:12:46,'cause he didn't really get to fight each other hand-to-hand.
00:12:46,00:12:51,"And so, what the tennis cabinet became was, every day,"
00:12:51,00:12:54,they had to get together and they picked a target on a map.
00:12:54,00:12:56,"And without checking any of the terrain,"
00:12:56,00:12:59,"whether it was full of rivers or mountains or piranhas,"
00:12:59,00:13:02,they had to just walk to that target without stopping
00:13:02,00:13:04,and without diverting from a straight course.
00:13:04,00:13:05,"And so they ended up doing things like,"
00:13:05,00:13:07,"at one point, they were all made to swim"
00:13:07,00:13:09,through a half-frozen river.
00:13:09,00:13:11,"And, yeah, if you survive that."
00:13:11,00:13:11,- When he was president.
00:13:11,00:13:12,- Yeah. - Wow.
00:13:12,00:13:14,"- Yeah, it's his cabinet."
00:13:14,00:13:15,"Well, then he used to have these big boxing fights"
00:13:15,00:13:16,"in the White House, didn't he?"
00:13:16,00:13:18,Where he invited professional boxers to come and fight him.
00:13:18,00:13:20,- Really? (audience laughs)
00:13:20,00:13:21,- Yeah.
00:13:21,00:13:23,You were asked to come and beat up the president.
00:13:23,00:13:25,- I imagine if the current president offered that
00:13:25,00:13:27,in the White House. - I imagine the queue.
00:13:27,00:13:30,(audience laughs)
00:13:30,00:13:32,- We're gonna have to move on very shortly.
00:13:32,00:13:34,"- Oh, well, we have to talk about the most hardcore member"
00:13:34,00:13:37,"of the Roosevelt family, which is his daughter, Alice."
00:13:37,00:13:39,She was amazing.
00:13:39,00:13:42,She basically was such a handful.
00:13:42,00:13:44,"At one stage, Roosevelt said,"
00:13:44,00:13:46,she kind of interrupted when he was doing something.
00:13:46,00:13:48,"He said, ""I can either run the country"
00:13:48,00:13:51,"""or I can attend to Alice, but I cannot possibly do both."""
00:13:51,00:13:53,"- Wow. - And she was,"
00:13:53,00:13:54,totally hardcore.
00:13:54,00:13:55,"- I mean, to be fair, it sounds like he was basically"
00:13:55,00:13:58,running a fight club instead of being president.
00:13:58,00:14:00,(audience laughs)
00:14:00,00:14:02,"- She was wild, 'cause he,"
00:14:02,00:14:04,"she had a bit of a traumatizing upbringing,"
00:14:04,00:14:06,"because so his wife and mother died on the same day,"
00:14:06,00:14:09,"and he was very upset about that, understandably."
00:14:09,00:14:12,And he refused to ever speak his wife's name again.
00:14:12,00:14:13,"But awkwardly, his wife's name was Alice,"
00:14:13,00:14:15,as was his daughter's.
00:14:15,00:14:18,"And so he never, he refused to ever say his daughter's name."
00:14:18,00:14:19,- What?
00:14:19,00:14:20,"- So she was a bit messed up about that,"
00:14:20,00:14:23,"and then they sort of made friends again a bit,"
00:14:23,00:14:25,but she used to do crazy stuff.
00:14:25,00:14:28,Like she smoked publicly on the roof of the White House.
00:14:28,00:14:29,She played poker.
00:14:29,00:14:31,She partied all night.
00:14:31,00:14:34,"She kept, so she carried bag around with her all the time,"
00:14:34,00:14:35,"in which she just kept a dagger,"
00:14:35,00:14:38,"her pet snake, who was called Emily Spinich,"
00:14:38,00:14:39,(audience laughs)
00:14:39,00:14:40,and a copy of the Constitution.
00:14:40,00:14:41,(audience laughs)
00:14:41,00:14:44,"- Sorry, the snake was called what?"
00:14:44,00:14:45,"- Oh, Emily Spinich."
00:14:45,00:14:46,"- Emily Spinich, great."
00:14:46,00:14:48,And a copy of the Constitution.
00:14:48,00:14:49,"- The Constitution, the US Constitution, yes."
00:14:49,00:14:50,"- Was that a tip from her dad,"
00:14:50,00:14:52,in case you go out and assassinate him?
00:14:52,00:14:54,"- It was, yeah, fold it up, yeah."
00:14:54,00:14:57,- The reason that she smoked on top of the White House roof
00:14:57,00:14:59,was because he said he forbade her
00:14:59,00:15:02,from smoking cigarettes under my roof.
00:15:02,00:15:04,"And so she's like, ""Fuck it, I'll go on the roof then."""
00:15:04,00:15:05,(audience laughs)
00:15:05,00:15:07,"- Ah, what a dick, that's so wonderful."
00:15:07,00:15:10,"- And then once Roosevelt left,"
00:15:10,00:15:12,"and the next guy came in who was Taft,"
00:15:12,00:15:15,"and then Woodrow Wilson afterwards,"
00:15:15,00:15:17,"she was banned from the White House, wasn't she?"
00:15:17,00:15:18,"- Oh yeah, was that when she buried a voodoo doll"
00:15:18,00:15:20,"of someone under the, in the grounds?"
00:15:20,00:15:22,- She buried a voodoo doll of Taft's wife
00:15:22,00:15:24,under the grounds before she left.
00:15:24,00:15:27,And then she made some kind of rybald joke
00:15:27,00:15:30,"about Woodrow Wilson that no matter how much you Google,"
00:15:30,00:15:32,you can never find this joke.
00:15:32,00:15:34,"Believe me, that's how I spent the last five days"
00:15:34,00:15:35,to find this joke.
00:15:35,00:15:38,"But yeah, everyone hated her, who came after her,"
00:15:38,00:15:39,and they wouldn't layer in the White House at all.
00:15:39,00:15:41,"- Wow, the woman who made a joke"
00:15:41,00:15:43,that's too rude for the internet.
00:15:43,00:15:43,- Yeah.
00:15:43,00:15:46,(upbeat music)
00:15:49,00:15:51,- We need to move on to our next fact.
00:15:51,00:15:53,"Okay, it is time for fact number two,"
00:15:53,00:15:56,and that is Andy.
00:15:56,00:15:59,- My fact is that some squirrels can put themselves
00:15:59,00:16:01,"in a deep freeze for the winter,"
00:16:01,00:16:04,"then thaw themselves out to have a pee,"
00:16:04,00:16:06,and then freeze themselves again.
00:16:06,00:16:08,(audience laughing)
00:16:08,00:16:09,"Yeah, they're very cool."
00:16:09,00:16:11,- They have a piss break during hibernation.
00:16:11,00:16:13,"- Well, seems to be, yeah."
00:16:13,00:16:15,"So this is the Arctic ground squirrel,"
00:16:15,00:16:17,and they are the most extreme hibernators on the planet.
00:16:17,00:16:20,They live so far north.
00:16:20,00:16:23,They hibernate for about 270 days of the year.
00:16:23,00:16:24,- Wow.
00:16:24,00:16:25,- Yeah.
00:16:25,00:16:27,- Imagine not leaving your house for 270 days.
00:16:27,00:16:30,(audience laughing)
00:16:30,00:16:32,"- They don't even have Netflix, James."
00:16:32,00:16:34,They don't have anything.
00:16:34,00:16:36,"So yeah, they slow down so much"
00:16:36,00:16:38,that their hearts beat twice a minute
00:16:38,00:16:40,"when they're in this sort of deep, deep chill state."
00:16:40,00:16:43,They can stop breathing for several minutes at a time
00:16:43,00:16:44,"when they're in this state,"
00:16:44,00:16:46,and most of their body gets down
00:16:46,00:16:49,to almost minus three degrees Celsius.
00:16:49,00:16:50,It's incredibly cold.
00:16:50,00:16:51,"We don't know how they do it,"
00:16:51,00:16:53,"but they don't freeze,"
00:16:53,00:16:55,as in ice crystals don't form throughout them.
00:16:55,00:16:58,"They have some way of stopping little ice crystals forming,"
00:16:58,00:17:00,"and so, 'cause that would kill them, obviously,"
00:17:00,00:17:01,"but they aren't that cold,"
00:17:01,00:17:03,and they just look like little stones
00:17:03,00:17:04,"on the ground, basically."
00:17:04,00:17:05,"- Yeah, so if you've got a bottle of water"
00:17:05,00:17:08,"and you can kind of make it go really, really, really cold,"
00:17:08,00:17:11,"but then there's nothing for the ice to form around,"
00:17:11,00:17:12,then it won't freeze.
00:17:12,00:17:14,And that's the same with these squirrels.
00:17:14,00:17:15,"But what that means is,"
00:17:15,00:17:17,if you pick up one of these squirrels that's hibernating
00:17:17,00:17:19,"and shake it, it will die."
00:17:19,00:17:22,(audience laughing)
00:17:22,00:17:25,- So don't do that.
00:17:25,00:17:27,- Would it freeze at the same time?
00:17:27,00:17:29,"- You would shake it, and then it would like--"
00:17:29,00:17:30,"- Smashing twice, wouldn't it?"
00:17:30,00:17:32,"- Yeah, yeah, it'd be like a frozen squirrel."
00:17:32,00:17:34,"- And is that because shaking it,"
00:17:34,00:17:35,"you get a bit of debris in,"
00:17:35,00:17:37,"and as soon as you get a tiny particle into their body,"
00:17:37,00:17:39,presumably it gets into their blood and it freezes it?
00:17:39,00:17:40,"- Exactly, even just by shaking it,"
00:17:40,00:17:43,a little bit of carbon dioxide inside the blood
00:17:43,00:17:44,"might just come free,"
00:17:44,00:17:47,"and then that would, everything would nuclear around that."
00:17:47,00:17:49,"- But they do have these periodic wake-ups, don't they?"
00:17:49,00:17:50,- Yes.
00:17:50,00:17:51,"- Where they sort of wean,"
00:17:51,00:17:53,"actually don't do much else, really."
00:17:53,00:17:56,"In fact, I think, largely, they don't even urinate."
00:17:56,00:17:59,They just wake up in order to go to sleep.
00:17:59,00:18:01,(audience laughing)
00:18:01,00:18:02,"- Which is amazing, right?"
00:18:02,00:18:03,- Yeah.
00:18:03,00:18:03,"- I always thought hibernation was sleep,"
00:18:03,00:18:06,"but no, it sounds snackering."
00:18:06,00:18:07,"- Yeah, it's absolutely exhausting."
00:18:07,00:18:10,"So they've got this store of fat between their shoulders,"
00:18:10,00:18:12,which apparently acts as sort of thermostat.
00:18:12,00:18:14,It's the only bit of them that's staying functional
00:18:14,00:18:16,"when they hibernate, and when they get a bit too cold,"
00:18:16,00:18:18,"they shiver themselves awake,"
00:18:18,00:18:21,"and if you watch a video of them, it is very sweet."
00:18:21,00:18:23,They're a little ball that starts shivering
00:18:23,00:18:25,"until the little ball of fat pumps blood around,"
00:18:25,00:18:28,and it's just so that they can wake up out of hibernation
00:18:28,00:18:31,"in order to have eight hours good sleep,"
00:18:31,00:18:34,"and go into their REM cycles, have some dreams,"
00:18:34,00:18:36,"and then, otherwise, they get sleep-deprived in hibernation."
00:18:36,00:18:38,"- I don't know if you guys read this,"
00:18:38,00:18:40,'cause you said they had dreams.
00:18:40,00:18:42,"I read one article, and it was from Brian Barnes,"
00:18:42,00:18:45,"who is the main guy on this subject,"
00:18:45,00:18:47,and he said that they take a lot of magic mushrooms
00:18:47,00:18:52,"just before hibernation, and nobody knows why they do it."
00:18:52,00:18:53,"Well, they're trying to get as much fat as possible,"
00:18:53,00:18:55,"so they're trying to eat as much as possible,"
00:18:55,00:18:58,but it just so happens that the thing that they eat
00:18:58,00:19:00,"are these mushrooms, which are hallucinogenic,"
00:19:00,00:19:03,and we don't know whether it gives them crazy dreams
00:19:03,00:19:07,"for the 270 days, or whether the liver might be able"
00:19:07,00:19:09,"to detoxify it or something, so we don't really know,"
00:19:09,00:19:12,"but it could be that for that whole 270 days,"
00:19:12,00:19:14,they're just thinking of dogs with nine legs.
00:19:14,00:19:17,(audience laughing)
00:19:17,00:19:18,- That's so cool.
00:19:18,00:19:21,"They're quite chemically altered in lots of ways,"
00:19:21,00:19:23,"'cause I don't know that, but the other thing they do"
00:19:23,00:19:27,"to survive is that they produce steroids in their body,"
00:19:27,00:19:29,"massive, massive levels of steroids"
00:19:29,00:19:31,"during the summer months when they're building up,"
00:19:31,00:19:34,and they build their muscles by a third in size.
00:19:34,00:19:36,"They increase by a third in just a few weeks,"
00:19:36,00:19:39,"and now, normally, that would lead to what we call"
00:19:39,00:19:44,"the thyroid rage, extra aggressive behavior, real fury."
00:19:44,00:19:45,- Tiny testicles.
00:19:45,00:19:47,- Tiny testicles.
00:19:47,00:19:49,"- And a deep urge to spread Christianity, of course."
00:19:49,00:19:52,(audience laughing)
00:19:52,00:19:58,"- But for some reason, they don't go into a rage,"
00:19:58,00:20:01,"so they can survive the testosterone coursing around them,"
00:20:01,00:20:05,"and the males have to stop when they do hibernate,"
00:20:05,00:20:06,"and then, this is a bit weird,"
00:20:06,00:20:08,"but their testicles shrink a lot,"
00:20:08,00:20:09,so we see that.
00:20:09,00:20:13,"But then, when they wake up, their testicles swell hugely,"
00:20:13,00:20:15,and they get a massive extra rush of testosterone
00:20:15,00:20:16,"when they wake up the next time round,"
00:20:16,00:20:18,and they basically go through puberty again.
00:20:18,00:20:20,They basically do this every year.
00:20:20,00:20:21,- That's rough.
00:20:21,00:20:22,- Yeah.
00:20:22,00:20:23,- That is rough.
00:20:23,00:20:24,- And the males live way shorter than females do.
00:20:24,00:20:27,"They live about six years, and when they wake up,"
00:20:27,00:20:29,they do actually go into a sort of fighting frenzy
00:20:29,00:20:31,"with other males, and then they have puberty,"
00:20:31,00:20:32,"and then they hope to mate, and then,"
00:20:32,00:20:34,I think the reason they live shorter is
00:20:34,00:20:36,because they have to go through puberty six times
00:20:36,00:20:38,"in their life, and it's too embarrassing."
00:20:38,00:20:40,(laughter)
00:20:40,00:20:43,"- The voice drop it, where it's a bit wobbly, yeah."
00:20:43,00:20:44,- The acne again.
00:20:44,00:20:46,(laughter)
00:20:46,00:20:48,"They all wake for longer than the females, though, aren't they?"
00:20:48,00:20:51,They go to sleep a bit later than the ladies.
00:20:51,00:20:54,"They sort of store food in a little cache,"
00:20:54,00:20:55,"whereas the ladies just fall asleep,"
00:20:55,00:20:59,and they wake up earlier in order to kind of
00:20:59,00:21:01,"start getting ready for mating,"
00:21:01,00:21:03,"and essentially, the females wake up"
00:21:03,00:21:05,"about three weeks after the males,"
00:21:05,00:21:09,and their entire waking life is waking up
00:21:09,00:21:11,"immediately being mated with,"
00:21:11,00:21:14,"within 12 hours of waking up by a male,"
00:21:14,00:21:16,"being pregnant, gestating for 25 days,"
00:21:16,00:21:19,"caring for the young for 10 weeks, going back to sleep."
00:21:19,00:21:21,That's their lives.
00:21:21,00:21:23,"- They probably need a lot of sleep after all that, though,"
00:21:23,00:21:25,"don't they, fairness? - They do."
00:21:25,00:21:27,"- They have very weird burrow systems,"
00:21:27,00:21:29,"or very clever burrow systems, actually,"
00:21:29,00:21:31,so they have three different kinds of house.
00:21:31,00:21:34,They don't just have one basic burrow.
00:21:34,00:21:36,The way they know that is 'cause when you're researching
00:21:36,00:21:38,"arctic ground squirrels, when researchers are researching them,"
00:21:38,00:21:40,they have to make really detailed maps
00:21:40,00:21:42,"of where all the burrow entrances and exits are,"
00:21:42,00:21:45,"so that if you take one away to study them,"
00:21:45,00:21:47,"when you put them back, you put them at the right door,"
00:21:47,00:21:49,like you don't put them in someone else's house.
00:21:49,00:21:51,- So they don't notice when they wake up.
00:21:51,00:21:53,They have no idea someone's been
00:21:53,00:21:54,"and rearranged the house, basically."
00:21:54,00:21:56,"- I guess so, yeah, they don't wake up and go,"
00:21:56,00:21:57,"""Where am I? That's not my picture."""
00:21:57,00:22:01,- You could put them the other way around
00:22:01,00:22:03,when they're hibernating just to freak them out.
00:22:03,00:22:04,"- So they think, ""Oh, lovely, I'll go to sleep facing"
00:22:04,00:22:06,"""my favorite nut,"" or whatever."
00:22:06,00:22:10,"And then they wake up facing their second favorite nut,"
00:22:10,00:22:12,and you've... - That's like my wife.
00:22:12,00:22:15,"She goes to sleep facing her first favorite, Dan,"
00:22:15,00:22:18,"and she wakes up with a second, Dan."
00:22:18,00:22:25,"- I mean, it did sound like you were gonna say"
00:22:25,00:22:27,"""facing her first favorite nut."""
00:22:27,00:22:30,(audience laughing)
00:22:30,00:22:36,"- Oh, poor woman."
00:22:36,00:22:39,"- I was just a steer away for a second,"
00:22:39,00:22:41,"but on hibernation, I was reading a blog"
00:22:41,00:22:42,"about hibernating hedgehogs,"
00:22:42,00:22:45,"and there was this wonderful thing where a person says,"
00:22:45,00:22:48,"""A way that you can tell that a hedgehog is hibernating"
00:22:48,00:22:50,"""is 'cause they look like they're dead, basically,"
00:22:50,00:22:52,"""if you go up to them, they're in the ball."
00:22:52,00:22:55,"""All you need to do is go right up to one,"
00:22:55,00:22:58,"""put your ear next to one, and you know it's hibernating"
00:22:58,00:23:00,"""'cause you can hear it snoring."""
00:23:00,00:23:03,"It's not sweet, a little (snoring)"
00:23:03,00:23:05,"of a hedgehog, and they snore when they hibernate,"
00:23:05,00:23:09,"not all of them sometimes, and possibly not even then,"
00:23:09,00:23:13,"but it's, yeah, it's just from a blog, but..."
00:23:13,00:23:15,- That's really sweet.
00:23:15,00:23:18,"I have a fact about squirrels, other squirrels,"
00:23:18,00:23:20,"Californian ground squirrels,"
00:23:20,00:23:21,slightly different kind of ground squirrel.
00:23:21,00:23:25,"So in 1918, California basically decided to wage war"
00:23:25,00:23:28,"on the squirrels, and they had something called Squirrel Week,"
00:23:28,00:23:30,"where posters were put up all over the state,"
00:23:30,00:23:32,encouraging the children of California
00:23:32,00:23:35,to kill as many squirrels as they could.
00:23:35,00:23:36,- Whoa.
00:23:36,00:23:37,"- And there were posters, just aimed at children,"
00:23:37,00:23:40,"saying things like, ""Slay the mother squirrel"
00:23:40,00:23:43,"""during breeding season, March to May,"""
00:23:43,00:23:45,"'cause they were quite invasive, and they ate a lot of crops,"
00:23:45,00:23:48,"and they carried bubonic plague, which is a bad thing,"
00:23:48,00:23:51,"so there were reasons for it, but it was pretty dark,"
00:23:51,00:23:54,so there was a pamphlet which advised how you could hook up
00:23:54,00:23:56,your exhaust pipe to a squirrel burrow.
00:23:56,00:23:57,- Jesus.
00:23:57,00:23:59,"- And wipe out a whole batch of them, like that."
00:23:59,00:24:02,"And they were depicted with little German soldier helmets,"
00:24:02,00:24:03,because the First World War was still going on.
00:24:03,00:24:06,"It was saying, ""We may be fighting Germany,"
00:24:06,00:24:08,"""but we're also fighting the squirrels."""
00:24:08,00:24:10,"In Squirrel Week, the children of California"
00:24:10,00:24:13,"killed 104,000 squirrels just in that week."
00:24:13,00:24:15,- Oh.
00:24:15,00:24:17,- And there were prizes for the schools that did best.
00:24:17,00:24:19,"- Yeah, wasn't there one girl who had like a kill list"
00:24:19,00:24:21,"of over 3,000, alone?"
00:24:21,00:24:22,"- I don't know, I didn't know that."
00:24:22,00:24:24,"- Yeah, she was like the head of the top of the pack."
00:24:24,00:24:26,- She went on to single-handedly defeat the Nazis
00:24:26,00:24:28,to be on the following wall.
00:24:28,00:24:30,(laughing)
00:24:30,00:24:33,"- The Cape Ground Squirrel is an interesting ground squirrel,"
00:24:33,00:24:37,"and that's because they can self-filate,"
00:24:37,00:24:39,"and not only can they do, they do so."
00:24:39,00:24:42,(laughing)
00:24:42,00:24:43,- You would.
00:24:43,00:24:46,- It's not like you and me just telling people we can do.
00:24:46,00:24:46,They prove it.
00:24:48,00:24:49,- Prove it.
00:24:49,00:24:51,(laughing)
00:24:51,00:24:53,"- For God's sake, don't prove it."
00:24:53,00:24:55,(laughing)
00:24:55,00:24:57,- Not before you showed me your favorite nuts.
00:24:57,00:24:58,Right.
00:24:58,00:25:00,(laughing)
00:25:00,00:25:04,Can I get on about this self-masturbating squirrel?
00:25:04,00:25:05,- You know self-masturbating is the only
00:25:05,00:25:07,"kind of masturbating, James."
00:25:07,00:25:09,(laughing)
00:25:09,00:25:09,- Well.
00:25:09,00:25:12,(laughing)
00:25:12,00:25:15,Go on.
00:25:15,00:25:18,"- If I do the fact, some of it might get in the podcast."
00:25:18,00:25:22,- 'Cause if I masturbate a pig for the...
00:25:22,00:25:23,(laughing)
00:25:23,00:25:25,- I don't think you're masturbating.
00:25:25,00:25:26,I think you're just...
00:25:26,00:25:27,- You're giving it a handy.
00:25:27,00:25:27,- Yeah.
00:25:27,00:25:28,"- No, no, no, no."
00:25:28,00:25:31,Because there's a breeding program for pigs.
00:25:31,00:25:32,"I'm not just, I'm not just..."
00:25:32,00:25:35,"Sorry, just to dress the seam."
00:25:35,00:25:37,(laughing)
00:25:37,00:25:40,I think I would be masturbating that pig.
00:25:40,00:25:42,- I think technically that's probably not true.
00:25:42,00:25:43,- Really?
00:25:43,00:25:45,- I would say technically.
00:25:45,00:25:47,"- Well, I've gotta go and refill in all the forms now."
00:25:47,00:25:49,(laughing)
00:25:49,00:25:53,- You've gotta rename the blog.
00:25:53,00:25:55,(laughing)
00:25:55,00:26:07,"- So, squirrels, they do it supposedly"
00:26:07,00:26:10,"as a form of self-medication, okay?"
00:26:10,00:26:12,"And the idea is that if they clean their genitals,"
00:26:12,00:26:16,"it might stop them from getting an STI, okay?"
00:26:16,00:26:19,And the best way for them to do that is to masturbate.
00:26:19,00:26:21,"However, they live in the desert"
00:26:21,00:26:24,and they can't afford to lose any water.
00:26:24,00:26:28,And so they need to get the water back into their body.
00:26:28,00:26:31,And so they clean their genitals
00:26:31,00:26:34,and they take in their fluids.
00:26:34,00:26:35,- Okay.
00:26:35,00:26:37,It's base two and base three is what you're saying.
00:26:37,00:26:39,(laughing)
00:26:39,00:26:40,- Base five.
00:26:40,00:26:43,Golly.
00:26:43,00:26:44,"- Well, gosh."
00:26:44,00:26:46,"- Now, whatever works."
00:26:46,00:26:47,"- That's the thing about this podcast,"
00:26:47,00:26:50,you always learn something you didn't know before.
00:26:50,00:26:51,"- But there are, yeah."
00:26:51,00:26:53,"Right, well, let's."
00:26:53,00:26:55,"- We've actually got to move on, guys."
00:26:55,00:26:57,(laughing)
00:26:57,00:26:59,"We don't actually need to, but I really think we should."
00:26:59,00:27:01,(laughing)
00:27:01,00:27:02,"I have one more thing about,"
00:27:02,00:27:05,this was about going to the Lou in the middle of the night.
00:27:05,00:27:05,"- Oh, yeah."
00:27:05,00:27:09,"- So Victorian tourists, I mean 19th century tourists,"
00:27:09,00:27:12,what you would do if you were a tourist in France
00:27:12,00:27:14,"because lots of, you know, accommodation"
00:27:14,00:27:17,would not have much in the way of sanitation.
00:27:17,00:27:19,Women would purchase an object
00:27:19,00:27:22,"which was sold called the Inodorous Standard Pale,"
00:27:22,00:27:23,"okay, and pale is in bucket."
00:27:23,00:27:25,And it had a mahogany rim
00:27:25,00:27:27,and a hermetically closing cover.
00:27:27,00:27:29,"And it was basically a,"
00:27:29,00:27:31,"what are we calling it, kind of chamber pot."
00:27:31,00:27:32,But the brilliant thing was
00:27:32,00:27:34,it was disguised as a hat box
00:27:34,00:27:37,so that you could carry it around without embarrassment.
00:27:37,00:27:38,(laughing)
00:27:38,00:27:40,- But you definitely don't want to put your hats in it.
00:27:40,00:27:42,"If someone asks, can I borrow your hat box?"
00:27:42,00:27:45,I've got a hat spare hat I need to carry.
00:27:45,00:27:46,"What is the excuse,"
00:27:46,00:27:48,the recommended excuse you're supposed to cook?
00:27:48,00:27:49,- I don't know.
00:27:49,00:27:50,- But it is a good excuse
00:27:50,00:27:53,if you accidentally piss in someone's hat box.
00:27:53,00:27:55,(laughing)
00:27:55,00:28:00,- We need to move on to our next fact.
00:28:00,00:28:04,"Okay, it is time for fact number three,"
00:28:04,00:28:06,and that is James.
00:28:06,00:28:10,"- Okay, my fact this week is that in 1385,"
00:28:10,00:28:12,a four year court case began
00:28:12,00:28:16,after two nights embarrassingly turned up to a battle
00:28:16,00:28:18,wearing the same coat of arms.
00:28:18,00:28:21,(laughing)
00:28:21,00:28:22,How embarrassing.
00:28:22,00:28:24,"- Yeah, were they completely mortified?"
00:28:24,00:28:25,Did someone go home?
00:28:25,00:28:26,Did they both fight the battle?
00:28:26,00:28:27,- They both fought the battle.
00:28:27,00:28:30,It was a bit later that the court case happened.
00:28:30,00:28:33,So this was during the Hundred Years War with France
00:28:33,00:28:37,in 1385 and Scotland had signed a pact with France
00:28:37,00:28:39,and some French soldiers had arrived
00:28:39,00:28:40,north of the border.
00:28:40,00:28:43,And so Richard II just come of age
00:28:43,00:28:45,trying to kind of show that he meant business.
00:28:45,00:28:47,He decided he was gonna invade Scotland.
00:28:47,00:28:49,And so they all went over this big army
00:28:49,00:28:50,to invade Scotland.
00:28:50,00:28:54,"And when they did, there was a guy called Richard Scroop,"
00:28:54,00:28:55,spelled Scroop but pronounced Scroop.
00:28:55,00:28:57,He was the first Baron of Bolton.
00:28:57,00:29:00,And so Robert Grovesner of Cheshire
00:29:00,00:29:02,and they both turned up and they realized
00:29:02,00:29:04,"that they had the exact same coat of arms,"
00:29:04,00:29:07,"which was an azure with a bend or,"
00:29:07,00:29:10,that's a blue background with a gold stash.
00:29:10,00:29:12,And everyone felt very awkward.
00:29:12,00:29:16,- The court case sounds amazing.
00:29:16,00:29:17,"- The court case really was,"
00:29:17,00:29:20,it was the who's who of the 14th century.
00:29:20,00:29:20,- Really?
00:29:20,00:29:21,"Well, it was a bit of,"
00:29:21,00:29:23,"I think it was a bit of a fix, this court case."
00:29:23,00:29:24,"So it was, who'd you say?"
00:29:24,00:29:28,It was Scroop of Bolton against Grovesner of Cheshire.
00:29:28,00:29:30,"But it was held, I think, in York Minster."
00:29:30,00:29:32,"And in York Minster, the Scroop coat of arms"
00:29:32,00:29:33,was all over the place.
00:29:33,00:29:36,So it's kind of subtle branding for the Scroop side.
00:29:36,00:29:38,"- Yeah, I should say it's not the good Bolton in Lancashire."
00:29:38,00:29:40,It's the shit Bolton in Yorkshire.
00:29:40,00:29:41,- Ah.
00:29:41,00:29:44,- Okay.
00:29:44,00:29:45,- Right.
00:29:45,00:29:46,- Got it.
00:29:46,00:29:47,- He's got that off his chest.
00:29:47,00:29:50,- That's why in York Minster they had his coat of arms.
00:29:50,00:29:51,"- Got it, got it, got it."
00:29:51,00:29:51,"That makes more sense, actually."
00:29:51,00:29:52,I was wondering about that.
00:29:52,00:29:53,- Yeah.
00:29:53,00:29:54,"- But then it turned out later on,"
00:29:54,00:29:55,"after this court case was over,"
00:29:55,00:29:58,there was a third family also using the same coat of arms.
00:29:58,00:30:00,"But they were in Cornwall and everyone said,"
00:30:00,00:30:01,"oh, well it's Cornwall."
00:30:01,00:30:03,"You know, they said, basically they said,"
00:30:03,00:30:04,"well, it's a different country."
00:30:04,00:30:05,So the rules are different there.
00:30:05,00:30:06,"- Yes, at the time it was."
00:30:06,00:30:08,"- Well, also the guy in Cornwall who claimed"
00:30:08,00:30:12,that his crest was the same was a guy called Carmenow.
00:30:12,00:30:15,"And he claimed that his crest had been given by King Arthur,"
00:30:15,00:30:18,which was quite impressive considering he didn't exist.
00:30:18,00:30:19,(laughing)
00:30:19,00:30:21,- We didn't definitively not exist.
00:30:21,00:30:22,- What?
00:30:22,00:30:24,"- Yeah, King Arthur didn't definitively not exist."
00:30:24,00:30:27,There are later reports of a character called Arthur.
00:30:27,00:30:29,"Anyway, we don't, but he's not an absolute,"
00:30:29,00:30:31,he's not like Peter Pan.
00:30:31,00:30:32,"- Well, it's a good job you weren't in charge"
00:30:32,00:30:33,of this court case either.
00:30:33,00:30:35,(laughing)
00:30:35,00:30:37,"- Wow, so there's maybe a King Arthur."
00:30:37,00:30:39,- He didn't do any of the stuff.
00:30:39,00:30:40,"- Well, that sucks."
00:30:40,00:30:41,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:30:41,00:30:42,(laughing)
00:30:42,00:30:43,- That's just a guy called Arthur then.
00:30:43,00:30:45,(laughing)
00:30:45,00:30:46,- It's kind of like Robin Hood.
00:30:46,00:30:48,"There's someone with the name,"
00:30:48,00:30:49,but none of the rest of it's true.
00:30:49,00:30:50,So it's not even worth it.
00:30:50,00:30:51,- Okay.
00:30:51,00:30:52,- Who was who of the 14th century?
00:30:52,00:30:54,"I want to know what a court case of the,"
00:30:54,00:30:55,who's who of the 14th century was.
00:30:55,00:30:57,- They named a single person for the 14th century.
00:30:57,00:31:00,"They were that, what was that, Geoffrey Charter?"
00:31:00,00:31:02,"- Yes, exactly."
00:31:02,00:31:04,"What was that, John of Gaunt?"
00:31:04,00:31:05,- Owen Glendauer?
00:31:05,00:31:06,"- Yes, him as well."
00:31:06,00:31:08,- That really is a who to.
00:31:08,00:31:10,- Anyone I've heard of in the 14th century
00:31:10,00:31:11,was in this court case.
00:31:11,00:31:14,- Was this the most exciting court case of the era?
00:31:14,00:31:15,- It doesn't sound like a big deal.
00:31:15,00:31:16,- It really wasn't.
00:31:16,00:31:17,It was quite dull.
00:31:17,00:31:18,(laughing)
00:31:18,00:31:20,"It was just basically, everyone came in."
00:31:20,00:31:22,And so let's say John of Gaunt turned up.
00:31:22,00:31:24,"John of Gaunt would go in and he would say,"
00:31:24,00:31:27,"""I once saw this guy with this coat of arms on this date."
00:31:27,00:31:29,And I saw this guy with a coat of arms on this date.
00:31:29,00:31:30,"And I saw this on this date."""
00:31:30,00:31:32,And then they got all of the evidence together
00:31:32,00:31:35,and they worked out who had the best claim on it.
00:31:35,00:31:36,"- Yeah, precedence, wasn't it?"
00:31:36,00:31:37,- Exactly.
00:31:37,00:31:38,"- Yeah, who would assume it at first."
00:31:38,00:31:41,So this was in the court of chivalry.
00:31:41,00:31:43,And the court of chivalry is an exciting thing
00:31:43,00:31:46,because this is a real court that exists
00:31:46,00:31:49,"and it hasn't sat since 1954, okay?"
00:31:49,00:31:51,"- It really is dead, isn't it?"
00:31:51,00:31:54,"- Well, it might be coming back."
00:31:54,00:31:57,"- Wait a minute, but what were the knights of armor in 1954?"
00:31:57,00:31:59,"- Oh, the 1954 case was a dispute"
00:31:59,00:32:02,between Manchester Corporation and Manchester Palace
00:32:02,00:32:06,of Varieties over unlicensed use of the Manchester coat of arms.
00:32:06,00:32:09,"That is dull, but before that, so, okay,"
00:32:09,00:32:11,there is a chance that the court of chivalry
00:32:11,00:32:14,is going to have to sit sometime soon
00:32:14,00:32:16,"because of weather spoons, okay?"
00:32:16,00:32:17,This is so exciting.
00:32:17,00:32:22,"So last year, last year, Barry Town Council in Wales."
00:32:22,00:32:24,- I thought that was his name.
00:32:24,00:32:26,(all laughing)
00:32:26,00:32:28,What an unfortunate Sunday night.
00:32:28,00:32:30,"- No, he invented the Town Council."
00:32:30,00:32:31,It's very impressive.
00:32:31,00:32:32,"Yeah, what a guy."
00:32:32,00:32:35,"Sorry, yeah."
00:32:35,00:32:37,Barry Town Council in Wales.
00:32:37,00:32:40,They were furious with weather spoons
00:32:40,00:32:42,because weather spoons in Barry
00:32:42,00:32:45,"had put the coat of arms of Barry,"
00:32:45,00:32:49,the Barry coat of arms on a carpet in their pub.
00:32:49,00:32:51,"- Oh, wow. - And Barry Town Council said,"
00:32:51,00:32:53,"hang on a second, you've got people walking"
00:32:53,00:32:55,"on the Barry coat of arms, maybe they're going to the bar,"
00:32:55,00:32:57,maybe they're going to the toilet.
00:32:57,00:32:58,We don't know where they're going.
00:32:58,00:33:00,"You know, maybe they've got a dog with them."
00:33:00,00:33:02,"I mean, they said it was very disrespectful."
00:33:02,00:33:04,"Tim Martin, the boss of weather spoons,"
00:33:04,00:33:05,refused to remove the carpet.
00:33:05,00:33:07,He said it's a perfectly good carpet.
00:33:07,00:33:08,We paid a lot of money for it.
00:33:08,00:33:10,Just let it wear out and we'll replace it
00:33:10,00:33:11,"in 10 years or so, whatever."
00:33:11,00:33:14,So they may yet go to the court of chivalry
00:33:14,00:33:16,if anyone can be bothered to.
00:33:16,00:33:17,- Cool.
00:33:17,00:33:19,"- Yeah, and they'll have to resurrect the entire court."
00:33:19,00:33:20,- And do you think it will be a who's
00:33:20,00:33:23,"who of the 21st century with sort of George Clooney,"
00:33:23,00:33:24,Barack Obama?
00:33:24,00:33:27,(all laughing)
00:33:27,00:33:29,Have you ever met Barry Town Council?
00:33:29,00:33:32,"I've met Barry Town Council, yeah."
00:33:32,00:33:35,"- I love the rules of chivalry, the whole chivalry thing."
00:33:35,00:33:37,I didn't quite know what goes into becoming a knight
00:33:37,00:33:39,when you were made and you were kind of trained
00:33:39,00:33:42,"in order to become one, but it was more than battle."
00:33:42,00:33:45,It was all these things like you had to learn
00:33:45,00:33:46,"how to box, wrestle, run."
00:33:46,00:33:47,"You had to read, write."
00:33:47,00:33:49,You had to play the harp and sing.
00:33:49,00:33:51,"That was part of becoming a knight, yeah,"
00:33:51,00:33:52,which is really sweet.
00:33:52,00:33:55,"- You also, you had to be a very good wooer."
00:33:55,00:33:57,"That was part of the code of chivalry,"
00:33:57,00:33:59,was you had to devotedly woo one woman.
00:33:59,00:34:01,"And it didn't, the woman could be married."
00:34:01,00:34:03,"That was fine, Lancelot, I think,"
00:34:03,00:34:05,was constantly wooing a married woman.
00:34:05,00:34:07,"- Again, possibly didn't exist or?"
00:34:07,00:34:10,"- No, yeah, yeah, he was a figure of chivalric mythology."
00:34:10,00:34:13,"But, you know, he was like a being to emulate."
00:34:13,00:34:14,"- He was wooing Gwynevere, wasn't he?"
00:34:14,00:34:15,"- Yeah, I thought he went for--"
00:34:15,00:34:17,- He went for the top trumps.
00:34:17,00:34:18,"- Top trumps, yeah. - I really went for it."
00:34:18,00:34:19,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:34:19,00:34:19,"- Martha's wife, yeah."
00:34:19,00:34:20,- You can't all hope for Gwynevere.
00:34:20,00:34:24,"- Gwynevere also, I think, a figure of chivalric myth,"
00:34:24,00:34:25,so not real.
00:34:25,00:34:27,- So all of these people are setting the standard
00:34:27,00:34:29,that you're supposed to imitate.
00:34:29,00:34:30,"And the reason it all came in, the chivalric codes,"
00:34:30,00:34:32,was 'cause knights were so badly behaved.
00:34:32,00:34:35,"They were just like, rampant around the countryside."
00:34:35,00:34:37,So there were lots of books written
00:34:37,00:34:39,about how to correct knight's behavior.
00:34:39,00:34:41,And so there were all these courtesy books written
00:34:41,00:34:44,in the sort of 12th century and 13th century.
00:34:44,00:34:46,"There was one called The Book of the Civilized Man,"
00:34:46,00:34:47,directed at knights.
00:34:47,00:34:51,And it just had sort of a bullet-pointed list of rules.
00:34:51,00:34:54,"So don't spit, don't talk with your mouth full."
00:34:54,00:34:55,"Don't take huge helpings,"
00:34:55,00:34:58,don't blow your nose on the tablecloth.
00:34:58,00:35:01,All things today that we would agree with.
00:35:01,00:35:02,- Don't wind off a pig.
00:35:02,00:35:05,(audience laughing)
00:35:05,00:35:07,- Don't auto-filate a mixed company.
00:35:07,00:35:10,(audience laughing)
00:35:10,00:35:11,"You may be thirsty, but the bar's over there."
00:35:11,00:35:14,(audience laughing)
00:35:14,00:35:15,- There was a don't defecate.
00:35:15,00:35:17,"Well, sorry, there was."
00:35:17,00:35:18,You weren't allowed to defecate.
00:35:18,00:35:20,You weren't allowed to attack your enemy
00:35:20,00:35:21,while he was defecating.
00:35:21,00:35:23,(audience laughing)
00:35:23,00:35:25,"Unchivalrous, yeah."
00:35:25,00:35:27,"- Unless he's riding a horse to cure his diarrhea,"
00:35:27,00:35:30,"in which case, he's on a horse, he's fair game."
00:35:30,00:35:31,- Yeah.
00:35:31,00:35:33,"- Wow, have you heard of the Scottish court"
00:35:33,00:35:35,and what they do to badly behaving knights?
00:35:35,00:35:38,"They will destroy your arms, I presume, your coat of arms."
00:35:38,00:35:42,(audience laughing)
00:35:42,00:35:43,It will be very mean.
00:35:43,00:35:44,"They will break your stained glass windows,"
00:35:44,00:35:46,which have got your coat of arms in them.
00:35:46,00:35:49,They will smash any unwarranted seals.
00:35:49,00:35:52,(audience laughing)
00:35:52,00:35:54,"Seals, like seals."
00:35:54,00:35:58,"But then they will issue a letter of horning, okay?"
00:35:58,00:35:59,"- Of what, sorry?"
00:35:59,00:36:01,"- Of horning, like horn, the horn."
00:36:01,00:36:02,"- Yeah, sorry."
00:36:02,00:36:05,"- Like, I've just given this pig the horn for my dog."
00:36:05,00:36:08,(audience laughing)
00:36:08,00:36:10,"But they do a letter, which denounces you as an outlaw,"
00:36:10,00:36:13,"and then they have three blasts of a horn,"
00:36:13,00:36:16,and that means you have technically been put to the horn.
00:36:16,00:36:17,"Pretty exciting stuff, yeah."
00:36:17,00:36:18,(audience laughing)
00:36:18,00:36:20,"- And wait, what does that mean to have been put,"
00:36:20,00:36:21,"aside from the fact that you do three blasts of a horn,"
00:36:21,00:36:22,but what's that do to you?
00:36:22,00:36:24,- I don't actually know what the ramifications are.
00:36:24,00:36:26,"- You're not a knight anymore, right?"
00:36:26,00:36:26,You're a knight.
00:36:26,00:36:27,"- Yeah, you're not a knight."
00:36:27,00:36:28,You've been put to the horn.
00:36:28,00:36:31,- Do you know why they're called coats of arms?
00:36:31,00:36:33,It's because you used to have a coat that you wore
00:36:33,00:36:36,"over your arms, your armor,"
00:36:36,00:36:37,and that's where the word comes from.
00:36:37,00:36:38,- Really?
00:36:38,00:36:39,- Isn't that amazing?
00:36:39,00:36:41,- But everyone was hoping that it was a coat made of arms.
00:36:41,00:36:43,- Yeah.
00:36:43,00:36:44,- That's the dream.
00:36:44,00:36:45,"- But you used to have your armor,"
00:36:45,00:36:47,"and you would always wear a cloak over it,"
00:36:47,00:36:50,"and the reason being that if you're fighting somewhere hot,"
00:36:50,00:36:52,"then wearing armor is pretty bad,"
00:36:52,00:36:54,"like you're basically gonna cook in there,"
00:36:54,00:36:55,"and so if you wore a cloak,"
00:36:55,00:36:56,"then it could stop you from getting,"
00:36:56,00:36:59,"from the sun's rays from cooking you,"
00:36:59,00:37:00,"and so you would always have to wear this cloak,"
00:37:00,00:37:01,"and on the back of the cloak,"
00:37:01,00:37:04,"it would have your arms, your coat of arms,"
00:37:04,00:37:06,and so that's where the word came from.
00:37:06,00:37:06,- Wow. - Hey.
00:37:06,00:37:07,"- It's not cool, yeah."
00:37:07,00:37:09,"- Superman, basically, like the original."
00:37:09,00:37:10,- Yeah.
00:37:10,00:37:11,- Saying who you are.
00:37:11,00:37:13,"- If you go on your back, that's so cool."
00:37:13,00:37:15,"- And the idea was you wanted people to know who you are,"
00:37:15,00:37:17,"because if you're an important person in a battle,"
00:37:17,00:37:19,"you don't wanna be killed, you wanna be captured."
00:37:19,00:37:20,"Well, you don't wanna be captured."
00:37:20,00:37:24,"You wanna win, but if you're your second best,"
00:37:24,00:37:26,"if you don't win, is to not die."
00:37:26,00:37:29,"- The team talking, like the halfway mark, right?"
00:37:29,00:37:31,"We've given up on a win,"
00:37:31,00:37:33,"but we are going for being captured, all of us."
00:37:33,00:37:38,"- So yeah, so you wanted to be captured,"
00:37:38,00:37:40,"and so you would have this kind of coat of armor,"
00:37:40,00:37:43,so that people would see you on battle and not kill you.
00:37:43,00:37:45,"They'd think, oh, well, he's worth something."
00:37:45,00:37:47,"I'm gonna take him instead of killing him,"
00:37:47,00:37:48,and then I'll be able to get some money.
00:37:48,00:37:50,- Quite catching someone else's shiny pog.
00:37:50,00:37:51,- Is it? - Yeah.
00:37:51,00:37:53,"- Yeah, that was a very specific,"
00:37:53,00:37:57,sort of 1994 kids there.
00:37:57,00:38:00,Jeff Bezos has a coat of arms.
00:38:00,00:38:02,"Yeah, it's got two tortoises and a rocket."
00:38:02,00:38:03,- A rocket?
00:38:03,00:38:04,- Yeah.
00:38:04,00:38:06,- I'm just imagining a cock on bull's formation.
00:38:06,00:38:09,(audience laughing)
00:38:09,00:38:10,"- You know what, I haven't seen it."
00:38:10,00:38:11,- I presume it is.
00:38:11,00:38:12,- It's kind of good.
00:38:12,00:38:13,- It's kind of good to assume.
00:38:13,00:38:14,It's Jeff Bezos.
00:38:14,00:38:14,- Absolutely.
00:38:14,00:38:16,"You can just get them made though,"
00:38:16,00:38:19,'cause there's the College of Arms in the UK
00:38:19,00:38:20,except Scotland.
00:38:20,00:38:23,Do you know what the Blue Mantle Persuivant
00:38:23,00:38:25,at the College of Arms gets paid each year?
00:38:25,00:38:26,- I didn't know what most of those words were.
00:38:26,00:38:27,- No.
00:38:27,00:38:28,(audience laughing)
00:38:28,00:38:29,- There's a lot of kind of
00:38:29,00:38:30,cod latin and comprehension stuff.
00:38:30,00:38:32,"No, Blue Mantle Persuivant, or Persuivant,"
00:38:32,00:38:34,is a junior position at the College of Arms.
00:38:34,00:38:36,Guess what he gets paid.
00:38:36,00:38:39,"- A tenner a year, or seven shillings and six pence,"
00:38:39,00:38:40,half a crown.
00:38:40,00:38:42,Three sticks and a dead porcupine.
00:38:42,00:38:43,- Lovely.
00:38:43,00:38:44,- Pogs.
00:38:44,00:38:45,Pogs.
00:38:45,00:38:46,(audience laughing)
00:38:46,00:38:49,"- Anna was closest, it's $13.95."
00:38:49,00:38:50,- Really?
00:38:50,00:38:52,"- For the ceremony where he was invested in his role,"
00:38:52,00:38:54,he had to buy a pair of silk tights
00:38:54,00:38:56,which cost double his annual salary.
00:38:56,00:38:57,(audience laughing)
00:38:57,00:38:59,- And is that taxpayer funded for God's sake?
00:38:59,00:39:02,(audience laughing)
00:39:02,00:39:03,- Who knows?
00:39:03,00:39:06,Do you know what all those weird words you just said?
00:39:06,00:39:08,"All that language, do you know what it's called?"
00:39:08,00:39:09,- No.
00:39:09,00:39:10,- It's called Blazen.
00:39:10,00:39:13,"So in heraldry, the weird language of heraldry,"
00:39:13,00:39:15,"which is lots of stuff that we don't understand,"
00:39:15,00:39:17,"it's called Blazen, and all the vocab,"
00:39:17,00:39:20,"and it's also related to the habits of heraldry,"
00:39:20,00:39:21,so all the traditions.
00:39:21,00:39:23,"So for instance, there's a difference between English"
00:39:23,00:39:26,and Scottish heraldry in Blazen.
00:39:26,00:39:30,And that is how you erase a bear's head.
00:39:30,00:39:33,"And so this is, you know, if you see a coat of arms,"
00:39:33,00:39:34,"then you'll sometimes have an animal,"
00:39:34,00:39:36,like a lion or a bear on it.
00:39:36,00:39:38,"And if you've got an erased head,"
00:39:38,00:39:40,what that means is a head that's been decapitated
00:39:40,00:39:42,"from a body, or it looks like it's been torn off"
00:39:42,00:39:43,from a body.
00:39:43,00:39:45,So it's got sort of ragged edges in the neck.
00:39:45,00:39:46,You will have seen it a lot.
00:39:46,00:39:48,But the way you tell the difference between
00:39:48,00:39:50,"an English coat of arms and a Scottish coat of arms is,"
00:39:50,00:39:54,a bear's head in English heraldry is erased horizontally
00:39:54,00:39:55,under the neck.
00:39:55,00:39:57,And so it goes across and you get some neck in.
00:39:57,00:40:00,"Whereas in Scotland, it's erased vertically"
00:40:00,00:40:02,and you cut the neck off.
00:40:02,00:40:04,So if you imagine a vertical line going down.
00:40:04,00:40:07,"So if a bear's got a neck, English, no neck,"
00:40:07,00:40:08,Scottish.
00:40:08,00:40:10,- We've been doing this podcast for six and a half years now.
00:40:10,00:40:13,And I think that is the least useful piece of information.
00:40:13,00:40:15,(audience laughing)
00:40:15,00:40:16,- Ever said.
00:40:16,00:40:20,"- Addy, if you are galloping into battle against the Scots,"
00:40:20,00:40:22,which may well happen in the near future.
00:40:22,00:40:23,(audience laughing)
00:40:23,00:40:25,You're gonna need to know.
00:40:25,00:40:27,(upbeat music)
00:40:27,00:40:33,- We need to move on to our final fact of the show.
00:40:33,00:40:35,It is time for our final fact of the show.
00:40:35,00:40:38,And that is Anna.
00:40:38,00:40:41,- My fact this week is that the Audubon Bird Protection
00:40:41,00:40:45,Society has warned its members against bird-splaining.
00:40:45,00:40:48,(audience laughing)
00:40:48,00:40:50,"- So, mansplaining is when a man annoyingly."
00:40:50,00:40:53,(audience laughing)
00:40:53,00:40:59,"So, but if mansplaining is when a man is awkwardly"
00:40:59,00:41:01,"explaining something which he doesn't need to,"
00:41:01,00:41:03,is bird-splaining when a bird explains something to you?
00:41:03,00:41:04,(audience laughing)
00:41:04,00:41:06,"- We don't call them birds these days,"
00:41:06,00:41:06,we call them women.
00:41:06,00:41:09,(audience laughing)
00:41:09,00:41:15,- I've been asleep for 270 days.
00:41:15,00:41:17,(audience laughing)
00:41:17,00:41:19,And my testicles are so sore.
00:41:19,00:41:21,(audience laughing)
00:41:21,00:41:23,"- It's not, you're right, it's an incorrect use"
00:41:23,00:41:26,of the explaining etymology because it's not like
00:41:26,00:41:28,when a pigeon gets really patronizing.
00:41:28,00:41:31,"It's basically, this is an article on the Audubon website"
00:41:31,00:41:35,which is sort of the authority on birds.
00:41:35,00:41:37,"And it was a bird writer, Becca Heisman."
00:41:37,00:41:41,She was sort of inspired by birdwatchers who do things
00:41:41,00:41:44,like get extremely agitated if people refer to
00:41:44,00:41:47,a Canadian goose as opposed to a Canada goose
00:41:47,00:41:49,or a seagull.
00:41:49,00:41:51,Birdwatchers hate people calling it a seagull
00:41:51,00:41:52,'cause there's no such thing as a seagull.
00:41:52,00:41:55,"There are gulls, lot of them don't live by the sea."
00:41:55,00:41:56,A seagull apparently is a nonsense term.
00:41:56,00:42:00,"Her warning to birdwatchers is, and I'm repeating it now,"
00:42:00,00:42:03,that it can put people off if as soon as you casually
00:42:03,00:42:05,"mention a seagull in conversation, someone says,"
00:42:05,00:42:07,"""Well actually there's no such thing as a seagull,"
00:42:07,00:42:08,"""so you're not making any sense."""
00:42:08,00:42:09,(audience laughing)
00:42:09,00:42:14,And that's the official word of the birdwatching society.
00:42:14,00:42:17,- But that's my life with you three.
00:42:17,00:42:20,(audience laughing)
00:42:20,00:42:21,"- Yeah, sorry about that."
00:42:21,00:42:25,"But yeah, birdwatchers, they're a pedantic breed,"
00:42:25,00:42:26,they can be.
00:42:26,00:42:28,"And just to clarify, yeah, a Canadian goose"
00:42:28,00:42:31,"should be a Canada goose, and gulls,"
00:42:31,00:42:34,"lots of different, 11 different types of gull in the UK."
00:42:34,00:42:36,And there is actually a Twitter account
00:42:36,00:42:39,"called @NoSuchGull, which is about,"
00:42:39,00:42:41,and the name is NoSuchThingAsAGull.
00:42:41,00:42:45,And it's kind of about how seagulls don't exist.
00:42:45,00:42:47,And so I don't really wanna slag off people
00:42:47,00:42:48,who are really pedantic about it
00:42:48,00:42:49,'cause they do actually follow QI
00:42:49,00:42:51,and retweeted us very recently.
00:42:51,00:42:52,"In fact, yesterday."
00:42:52,00:42:54,"- I think the most fascinating thing about that fact is,"
00:42:54,00:42:55,you were on Twitter.
00:42:55,00:42:56,(audience laughing)
00:42:56,00:42:58,- Yeah.
00:42:58,00:43:00,- I only go on for birdwatching updates.
00:43:00,00:43:02,(audience laughing)
00:43:02,00:43:03,"- I can be hard though, being a birdwatcher."
00:43:03,00:43:05,I think we should cut them some slack.
00:43:05,00:43:09,"In 2013, they found this amazing rare bird"
00:43:09,00:43:10,on the island of Harris.
00:43:10,00:43:13,It was a white-throated needle tail.
00:43:13,00:43:16,"Normally you'd only find it in Asia or in Australia,"
00:43:16,00:43:17,"but it was on the island of Harris,"
00:43:17,00:43:20,probably got caught on a draft of wind or something.
00:43:20,00:43:23,And so everyone suddenly got a message on their phones
00:43:23,00:43:24,"or on their Twitter account saying,"
00:43:24,00:43:28,"""Guys, there is a white-throated needle tail on Harris."""
00:43:28,00:43:31,And loads of people went up there to the island
00:43:31,00:43:34,"all the way up in the north of Scotland to see this bird,"
00:43:34,00:43:37,which was then hit by a wind turd behind me.
00:43:37,00:43:38,- No.
00:43:38,00:43:40,- In front of all these birdwatchers.
00:43:40,00:43:42,- Oh.
00:43:42,00:43:43,- That's what it was going.
00:43:43,00:43:45,I've got an amazing updraft here.
00:43:45,00:43:45,Wow.
00:43:45,00:43:48,(audience laughing)
00:43:48,00:43:49,"- It does happen, doesn't it?"
00:43:49,00:43:51,"I think there was a story that someone,"
00:43:51,00:43:52,is it a pharaoh lope?
00:43:52,00:43:53,"There's a bird called a pharaoh lope, I think."
00:43:53,00:43:54,Does anyone know?
00:43:54,00:43:56,"- Actually, it's a pharaoh lope."
00:43:56,00:43:58,"- I think it was something like a gray pharaoh lope,"
00:43:58,00:44:00,"and I'm going off memory, so I really can't remember it,"
00:44:00,00:44:01,"but it was, these birdwatchers had got to it,"
00:44:01,00:44:03,"and they were so excited about seeing it,"
00:44:03,00:44:05,"very rare in the area where they were,"
00:44:05,00:44:09,and then they saw a buzzard just arrive and land and eat it
00:44:09,00:44:10,right in front of them.
00:44:10,00:44:12,"But then they did say, although the buzzards actually,"
00:44:12,00:44:13,"they're very rarely feed on that kind of prey,"
00:44:13,00:44:16,"so it kind of two birds with one stone, to be honest."
00:44:16,00:44:17,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:44:17,00:44:19,"- They used that phrase, they used that phrase genuinely, yeah."
00:44:19,00:44:21,"- Well, they're funny guys."
00:44:21,00:44:24,- Have you heard of other birdwatching slang?
00:44:24,00:44:27,This gets used in the birdwatching community.
00:44:27,00:44:30,Do you want to have a guess at what a not a bird is?
00:44:30,00:44:31,- Is it something that's not a bird?
00:44:31,00:44:33,- Something that's not a bird.
00:44:33,00:44:35,"It's something that looks like a bird from a distance,"
00:44:35,00:44:37,"but once binoculars or a spotting scope is used,"
00:44:37,00:44:39,turns out not to be a bird.
00:44:39,00:44:41,- Is it something that's either a plane or Superman?
00:44:41,00:44:42,- That's right.
00:44:42,00:44:45,(audience laughing)
00:44:45,00:44:47,- Have you heard of a pseudo bird?
00:44:47,00:44:49,- Sudo bird sounds like it's also a not a bird.
00:44:49,00:44:51,"- Well, a pseudo bird is something that looks like a bird,"
00:44:51,00:44:53,"and perhaps even moves like a bird,"
00:44:53,00:44:56,until it is examined through binoculars or a spotting scope
00:44:56,00:44:59,and found to be something completely different.
00:44:59,00:45:00,(audience laughing)
00:45:00,00:45:02,- What is an example of a pseudo bird?
00:45:02,00:45:03,- Like a bag of crisps.
00:45:03,00:45:05,- Bag of crisps.
00:45:05,00:45:05,- Very good.
00:45:05,00:45:06,"- Wow, very good."
00:45:06,00:45:08,"- You know, in the corner of the tree."
00:45:08,00:45:10,- This very much feels like sort of class one
00:45:10,00:45:11,"of all anthology, doesn't it?"
00:45:11,00:45:12,(audience laughing)
00:45:12,00:45:14,Are you struggling to identify a bird?
00:45:14,00:45:15,- Yeah.
00:45:15,00:45:16,(audience laughing)
00:45:16,00:45:19,"Do you know what more slang, do you know what jizz is in it?"
00:45:19,00:45:20,"- Yes, let's move on."
00:45:20,00:45:22,- I see you read my blog then.
00:45:22,00:45:25,(audience laughing)
00:45:25,00:45:30,"- Jizz is the sort of,"
00:45:30,00:45:32,"when you can't quite see what the bird is,"
00:45:32,00:45:35,"and you talk about the vibe of the bird,"
00:45:35,00:45:36,"like it's giving off this vibe,"
00:45:36,00:45:38,so it must be this kind of bird.
00:45:38,00:45:40,"- So it kind of, it moves a bit like a black bird,"
00:45:40,00:45:42,"and it's kind of blackish,"
00:45:42,00:45:44,and you think that probably is a black bird?
00:45:44,00:45:45,Is that what it is?
00:45:45,00:45:46,"- I think so, yes."
00:45:46,00:45:48,"- It's basically the whole demeanour, isn't it, jizz?"
00:45:48,00:45:50,"That bird's jizz is, well, it's tall, it's fat,"
00:45:50,00:45:51,"it's brown, it's--"
00:45:51,00:45:53,"- Wow, what is this bird?"
00:45:53,00:45:54,"- It's tall, it's fat, it's yellow,"
00:45:54,00:45:56,I'm watching Sesame Street.
00:45:56,00:45:59,(audience laughing)
00:45:59,00:46:03,"- It's been in use for a long time, though."
00:46:03,00:46:06,"I think it even predates jizz as we know it today,"
00:46:06,00:46:08,but there are rumors that it stands
00:46:08,00:46:10,"for general impression, size, and shape,"
00:46:10,00:46:12,"which was a military term in the Second World War,"
00:46:12,00:46:15,"but it actually comes from before that, from 1922,"
00:46:15,00:46:18,"and it now is spread to, like, all biologists,"
00:46:18,00:46:20,"you'll talk about plants jizz as well, which is--"
00:46:20,00:46:23,"- I like one etymology, I don't know if this is true either,"
00:46:23,00:46:25,but people say it just is.
00:46:25,00:46:26,What is that bird?
00:46:26,00:46:28,"Oh, it just, it just is, jizz."
00:46:28,00:46:30,- Feels to me like it comes from jist.
00:46:30,00:46:30,"Hey, what's the jist?"
00:46:30,00:46:33,"- Jist, yeah, that's better, isn't it?"
00:46:33,00:46:36,- Do you know what gripping someone off is in birdwatching?
00:46:36,00:46:39,(audience laughing)
00:46:39,00:46:41,"- Well, it can get very exciting."
00:46:41,00:46:44,"- You've got to do something to pass to the air as well,"
00:46:44,00:46:46,"waiting for the white-tailed needle thing,"
00:46:46,00:46:50,but gripping someone off is a bad thing to do
00:46:50,00:46:52,"in birdwatching, it's where you see a bird"
00:46:52,00:46:54,"that someone else has missed out on,"
00:46:54,00:46:57,and then you tell them about the bird that you've seen.
00:46:57,00:46:59,"So you'll sort of bragging to them,"
00:46:59,00:47:00,and you know that they've missed the opportunity
00:47:00,00:47:01,to see this bird.
00:47:01,00:47:02,"- Oh, really?"
00:47:02,00:47:04,"- Yeah, yeah, and if someone's not noticed it,"
00:47:04,00:47:06,"maybe they were looking at it in the wrong place,"
00:47:06,00:47:08,"or whatever, so that's a bad thing to do."
00:47:08,00:47:10,Don't grip off if you do go birdwatching.
00:47:10,00:47:12,- So you're just not allowed to share?
00:47:12,00:47:14,"If you see something cool, you're not allowed to,"
00:47:14,00:47:15,you have to keep it secret in case
00:47:15,00:47:16,someone gets upset they didn't see it.
00:47:16,00:47:17,"You're supposed to share,"
00:47:17,00:47:20,"but some asshole birdwatchers grip people off,"
00:47:20,00:47:23,"and they're like, oh yeah, I saw it last week,"
00:47:23,00:47:24,you're too late.
00:47:24,00:47:25,"I could have told you, but I didn't."
00:47:25,00:47:27,"- Yeah, right."
00:47:27,00:47:29,"- Just as it's disappearing down the buzzard's gullet,"
00:47:29,00:47:34,"you say, I've just seen a farolope, or whatever, yeah."
00:47:34,00:47:36,"- This fact was about the Audubon Society, right?"
00:47:36,00:47:39,"The Bird Society, and he actually is an incredible"
00:47:39,00:47:42,"character from history, who was the first person"
00:47:42,00:47:45,to put together a sort of great collection of paintings
00:47:45,00:47:48,"published in a book of the birds of America,"
00:47:48,00:47:51,and it's one of those rare books now
00:47:51,00:47:53,that it basically outsells any book
00:47:53,00:47:55,"in terms of price value at an auction,"
00:47:55,00:47:59,"so a copy went a while ago for about 11 million,"
00:47:59,00:48:00,11 million.
00:48:00,00:48:01,"- Yeah, it's--"
00:48:01,00:48:02,"- We've got one in our house, no."
00:48:02,00:48:03,- An original?
00:48:03,00:48:05,"- Oh, I don't know, okay, so it's not all of them"
00:48:05,00:48:06,going for that.
00:48:06,00:48:08,(audience laughs)
00:48:08,00:48:11,"- No, your Kindle PDF is not gonna be sold at Sotheby's."
00:48:11,00:48:15,Have you noticed that every branch of Waterstones
00:48:15,00:48:17,has a massive safe in the middle of the shop floor?
00:48:17,00:48:18,That's where they keep that book.
00:48:18,00:48:19,- Yes.
00:48:19,00:48:21,- I was just close to starting up
00:48:21,00:48:23,"and walking off the podcast, never to return."
00:48:23,00:48:24,"- Fuck you, guys!"
00:48:24,00:48:27,(audience laughs)
00:48:27,00:48:28,- Bye.
00:48:28,00:48:32,"Sorry, so some versions are very expensive, yeah?"
00:48:32,00:48:34,"- Yeah, so it's an amazing book,"
00:48:34,00:48:35,"and he used to paint these birds,"
00:48:35,00:48:39,and it used to be a bit more of a vicious bird spotting thing.
00:48:39,00:48:41,"These days, the idea, I think, of hurting a bird"
00:48:41,00:48:44,"in any way would be horrible back then,"
00:48:44,00:48:45,"in order to paint the bird and spot them,"
00:48:45,00:48:46,"you actually had to kill them,"
00:48:46,00:48:49,"so he used to go around and he would shoot birds,"
00:48:49,00:48:51,and then what he would do is he would put
00:48:51,00:48:53,sort of wires onto them and pose them
00:48:53,00:48:56,as if they were mid-flight so that he could capture them
00:48:56,00:48:58,"as if they were in the nature and they were alive,"
00:48:58,00:49:00,which is very different to any kind of drawing
00:49:00,00:49:02,"at that time, it was usually very posed and very still."
00:49:02,00:49:04,"So he kind of, he did that brilliantly,"
00:49:04,00:49:06,"but the other amazing thing is this book,"
00:49:06,00:49:08,"the original book, how tall is your book?"
00:49:08,00:49:10,"- It's about this big, it's big."
00:49:10,00:49:11,"- It's a big book, and the original,"
00:49:11,00:49:13,the idea was he wanted to capture the birds
00:49:13,00:49:15,"in their full size, so when you saw it,"
00:49:15,00:49:18,it was almost as if you were in front of one.
00:49:18,00:49:19,"Yeah, but what's really wonderful is"
00:49:19,00:49:22,"he slightly miscalculated the size of some of the birds,"
00:49:22,00:49:24,"so in some of them, they've had to be contorted"
00:49:24,00:49:29,"to sort of fit to the page, like squish down with wings."
00:49:29,00:49:31,"Yeah, but yeah, really fascinating character."
00:49:31,00:49:33,"- He was, do you know how he made his living"
00:49:33,00:49:36,before he got into the bird drawing business?
00:49:36,00:49:37,"Or in fact, as like, you know,"
00:49:37,00:49:39,"while he was drawing birds as a hobby,"
00:49:39,00:49:41,"he made his money as a death bed artist,"
00:49:41,00:49:45,"so that's someone who, if someone you love dies,"
00:49:45,00:49:47,"you go, oh my God, we forgot to get a portrait of them,"
00:49:47,00:49:49,"we'd better get one now, and you went"
00:49:49,00:49:51,and you would paint a portrait of a dead person
00:49:51,00:49:54,"of the corpse, and it would be lying in repose"
00:49:54,00:49:56,with maybe a bunch of flowers or photograph or something.
00:49:56,00:49:59,"- But would he pose them like he later did the birds,"
00:49:59,00:50:01,as in with wires and with--
00:50:01,00:50:05,"- Absolutely, yeah, doing the high jump or backflip."
00:50:05,00:50:06,However you wanted it.
00:50:08,00:50:11,- Have you guys heard of Phoebe Snetsinger?
00:50:11,00:50:13,Phoebe Snetsinger's amazing.
00:50:13,00:50:18,"So she, in 1981, was diagnosed with terminal cancer"
00:50:18,00:50:20,and decided that instead of going into a home
00:50:20,00:50:22,"and just kind of succumbing to it,"
00:50:22,00:50:25,"she decided, well, I've not got much time left,"
00:50:25,00:50:26,so I'm gonna go and look for birds.
00:50:26,00:50:30,"Okay, and she took a trip to Alaska to look for birds,"
00:50:30,00:50:32,"and she kept looking for birds and kept looking for birds,"
00:50:32,00:50:34,and luckily enough got into remission
00:50:34,00:50:36,"and kept looking for birds,"
00:50:36,00:50:37,and she was the first person to see
00:50:37,00:50:41,"more than 8,000 species of birds ever,"
00:50:41,00:50:43,"and when she died, eventually,"
00:50:43,00:50:46,"she'd seen 8,398 birds,"
00:50:46,00:50:51,which was 85% of the known species in the world she'd seen.
00:50:51,00:50:52,Isn't that amazing?
00:50:52,00:50:52,- Wow!
00:50:52,00:50:54,- So good.
00:50:54,00:50:56,"We're gonna have to wrap up soon, guys."
00:50:56,00:50:58,"Yeah, no, we are, but we are."
00:50:58,00:50:59,"- No, yes."
00:50:59,00:51:02,- But I haven't told you about Graham Moss yet.
00:51:02,00:51:03,- Right.
00:51:03,00:51:04,"- You've hooked me, go for it."
00:51:04,00:51:06,(audience laughing)
00:51:06,00:51:07,"- This is a bird watching story from this year,"
00:51:07,00:51:09,and it's just a rather nice one.
00:51:09,00:51:11,"It's Doncaster Baby Owl webcam,"
00:51:11,00:51:15,banned by Facebook over sex and nudity rule.
00:51:15,00:51:20,"So, this summer, a man in Doncaster called Graham Moss,"
00:51:20,00:51:22,he set up a very sweet webcam of some baby owls
00:51:22,00:51:23,"in their nest, and just--"
00:51:23,00:51:25,- So were you looking at Moss News?
00:51:25,00:51:26,"- You were, weren't you?"
00:51:26,00:51:29,(audience laughing)
00:51:29,00:51:30,"- This is a complete coincidence,"
00:51:30,00:51:31,although there is a book about bird watching
00:51:31,00:51:33,by someone called Stephen Moss.
00:51:33,00:51:34,"- All right, you've been looking at Moss News."
00:51:34,00:51:36,"- And fortunately, it's coincided with the research"
00:51:36,00:51:38,"for today, but you got lucky."
00:51:38,00:51:41,"- But it got, his webcam was taken down twice"
00:51:41,00:51:42,'cause it breached the community guidelines
00:51:42,00:51:45,on adult nudity and sexual activity.
00:51:45,00:51:46,- But what was happening?
00:51:46,00:51:47,"- Nothing, nothing was happening."
00:51:47,00:51:50,"It was just some baby owls, but either algorithmically,"
00:51:50,00:51:51,it saw the sort of--
00:51:51,00:51:52,- Algorithmically?
00:51:52,00:51:54,- There we go.
00:51:54,00:51:56,(audience laughing)
00:51:56,00:51:58,"- No one's seeing this outside the street, but I--"
00:51:58,00:52:00,(audience laughing)
00:52:00,00:52:02,"- But yeah, it always thinks he was pranked,"
00:52:02,00:52:04,"but I think it's possible that algorithmically,"
00:52:04,00:52:07,someone would see some sort of writhing flesh in a nest.
00:52:07,00:52:09,- You think that looks rude?
00:52:09,00:52:10,- Were they featherless?
00:52:10,00:52:11,- Were they naked?
00:52:11,00:52:12,"- Well, they were baby owls,"
00:52:12,00:52:14,so I think they probably would have been very feathered.
00:52:14,00:52:16,"- Yeah, you can get in trouble with things like that."
00:52:16,00:52:20,The Christmas Island tourist board went onto Facebook
00:52:20,00:52:24,to advertise the island's annual Burden Nature Week
00:52:24,00:52:26,"with the headline, ""Some gorgeous shots here"
00:52:26,00:52:28,"""of some juvenile boobies."""
00:52:28,00:52:29,"- Oh, fuck."
00:52:29,00:52:30,- No.
00:52:30,00:52:33,"- And Facebook, for some reason, took them down."
00:52:33,00:52:35,(audience laughing)
00:52:35,00:52:37,"And they appealed to Facebook, saying,"
00:52:37,00:52:38,"""Charlie, some mistake."
00:52:38,00:52:40,"""We're just talking about this bird,"
00:52:40,00:52:42,"""which is called a boobie,"" and Facebook went, ""Nope."""
00:52:42,00:52:43,(audience laughing)
00:52:43,00:52:44,- That's kind of fair.
00:52:44,00:52:47,"- I read there was an interview, Birdwatch Ireland,"
00:52:47,00:52:50,"there was a member called Niall Hatch,"
00:52:50,00:52:53,and the person interviewing just got so excited
00:52:53,00:52:54,"that he was called Hatch,"
00:52:54,00:52:57,"that he derailed the conversation in order to say,"
00:52:57,00:52:58,"""Oh, that's funny, isn't it?"""
00:52:58,00:53:01,"And then he turned out, he said,"
00:53:01,00:53:03,"""It's actually not as sort of uncommon"
00:53:03,00:53:05,"""to have a bird-related name for members"
00:53:05,00:53:07,"""of the Birdwatch Ireland."
00:53:07,00:53:08,"""It's a bit more common."""
00:53:08,00:53:10,So he then listed off a bunch of people
00:53:10,00:53:12,that were past and present people as part of it.
00:53:12,00:53:15,"So we had Donald Finch,"
00:53:15,00:53:18,"Ashlyn Tallinn, Steven Wing, Dave Bird."
00:53:18,00:53:19,(audience laughing)
00:53:19,00:53:21,"Bit on the nose, Dave."
00:53:21,00:53:23,(audience laughing)
00:53:23,00:53:25,"- That is so a fake name, isn't it?"
00:53:25,00:53:26,(audience laughing)
00:53:26,00:53:27,- Look at Ms. Tallinn over here.
00:53:27,00:53:29,She's picked a part of the bird.
00:53:29,00:53:30,(audience laughing)
00:53:30,00:53:31,- Dave Bird.
00:53:31,00:53:32,- Dave Bird.
00:53:32,00:53:33,- Yeah.
00:53:33,00:53:34,- Anyone else?
00:53:34,00:53:36,- There's Mark Robbins.
00:53:36,00:53:38,"- See, Mark's picked a species of bird."
00:53:38,00:53:40,"Not like you, Dave."
00:53:40,00:53:42,- Olivia Crow.
00:53:42,00:53:43,- And yeah.
00:53:43,00:53:45,"- Mark, do you think sometimes people"
00:53:45,00:53:48,"in Birdwatching societies go, ""Mark, Robbins."""
00:53:48,00:53:49,(audience laughing)
00:53:49,00:53:50,"Just saying, ""Look, Robbins."""
00:53:50,00:53:52,"- Do you think they go, ""Dave, bird?"""
00:53:52,00:53:55,(audience laughing)
00:53:55,00:53:56,- I've got one last thing.
00:53:56,00:53:59,"Just on the subject of being pedantic and bird-splaining,"
00:53:59,00:54:02,"we've actually had, I've been sent a WhatsApp message"
00:54:02,00:54:05,"by Alex Bell, who is one of the fish team."
00:54:05,00:54:07,He just wants me to pass this on to Anna.
00:54:07,00:54:11,"Anna's Gull Twitter thing is @NoSuchSeagull,"
00:54:11,00:54:13,not @NoSuchGulls.
00:54:13,00:54:15,(audience laughing)
00:54:15,00:54:17,- And I think we now know who runs that account.
00:54:17,00:54:20,(audience laughing)
00:54:20,00:54:22,"- Okay, that's it."
00:54:22,00:54:23,That is all of our facts.
00:54:23,00:54:25,Thank you so much for listening.
