00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,260
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,260 --> 00:00:04,040
 Hi everyone, welcome to this week's episode

3
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:06,160
 of No Such Thing as a Fish.

4
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:09,720
 Anna Tyshinski is still off on her hollybabs.

5
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:13,960
 And so we have for you a very, very special guest.

6
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:16,820
 It is Melanie Bracewell.

7
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:19,640
 Now those of you down under will know who Melanie is.

8
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:24,040
 She is a regular on television in Australia and New Zealand.

9
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:26,880
 She's recently been on New Zealand Taskmaster.

10
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:30,160
 If anyone outside of New Zealand has naughtily managed

11
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:32,560
 to get hold of that on the tubes.

12
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:34,720
 (laughs)

13
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:36,560
 You'll know her from that.

14
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:39,000
 But we've actually known Mel for many, many years.

15
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
 We first met her when we did our New Zealand tour

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,280
 many years ago.

17
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,000
 We've been wanting to get her on the podcast

18
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,120
 for ages and ages.

19
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:49,920
 And finally she is in the UK and she came on the show.

20
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,880
 And actually that brings me to the fact

21
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:54,440
 that she is touring the UK at the moment.

22
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:57,840
 So if you listen to this podcast, you like what you hear.

23
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,680
 I know you will 'cause she's absolutely brilliant.

24
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:00,800
 She's so funny.

25
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:03,000
 Then definitely get down to one of her gigs.

26
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,220
 You'll have to get in there fast

27
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:07,480
 because she is already right in the middle of that tour.

28
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:09,400
 But if you listen to this as soon as it comes out

29
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:11,160
 then you just about have enough time

30
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:13,440
 to get to her gigs in Stafford, Edinburgh,

31
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:16,180
 Glasgow, London, Cambridge and Birmingham.

32
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:18,400
 That's all happening in the next week or so.

33
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:21,880
 And of course if you are in Australia or New Zealand

34
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:23,920
 then she's doing loads of gigs down there.

35
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,640
 And actually in the UK she'll be back

36
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:28,480
 to do the Edinburgh Festival in the summer.

37
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:30,480
 So if you want to know any more about Melanie

38
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:32,640
 go to melaniebracewell.com.

39
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,320
 And if you want to know where she's playing

40
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:38,880
 then go to melaniebracewell.com/gigs.

41
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,260
 Really hope you enjoy the show.

42
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:42,000
 I'm absolutely certain you will.

43
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,020
 So let's just say on with the podcast.

44
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:47,600
 (upbeat music)

45
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:53,680
 (upbeat music)

46
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,900
 (upbeat music)

47
00:01:56,900 --> 00:02:07,080
 - Hello and welcome to another episode

48
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:09,720
 of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast

49
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:12,440
 coming to you from the QI offices in Hoburn.

50
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:13,560
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

51
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,760
 I am sitting here with Andrew Hunter Murray,

52
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,400
 James Harkin and Melanie Bracewell.

53
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,600
 And once again we have gathered round the microphones

54
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:23,120
 with our four favourite facts from the last seven days

55
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:26,040
 and in no particular order, here we go.

56
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:29,000
 Starting with fact number one, that is Mel.

57
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,440
 - Yes, my fact this week is that a study of magpies

58
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:36,680
 in Australia has revealed that magpies

59
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:38,320
 do not like to be studied.

60
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:42,080
 So this was a study that they did

61
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,440
 at the University of the Sunshine Coast.

62
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:46,120
 They were trying to track flight patterns

63
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,240
 and things of magpies.

64
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,800
 They developed these very special trackers

65
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,280
 that are only 1% of a magpies body weight.

66
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:54,320
 This is perfect and they put these trackers on the birds

67
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:56,520
 and they quickly just started pecking them away

68
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,320
 and they went, oh, they're not being very successful.

69
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,160
 It'll be okay.

70
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:01,680
 And then the other magpies came

71
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,720
 and just helped them peck the trackers off of them.

72
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:08,280
 So at first they were sort of, you know,

73
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:10,120
 you scratch my back, I'll scratch yours

74
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,600
 and they were pecking them off each other.

75
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,200
 But then they found that other magpies

76
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,560
 who didn't even have a tracker in the first place

77
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:18,800
 were helping the other magpies to get rid of their trackers.

78
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,920
 So they were showing behaviors of like ultrism.

79
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,000
 And so they were like, actually,

80
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,560
 this is quite a good study.

81
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,920
 - Oh, so that's how they know.

82
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,840
 I was hoping they'd decoded like some calls of theirs

83
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:31,680
 and they would translate this piece off, mate.

84
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:32,520
 - Probably, yeah.

85
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:35,040
 - Actually, you know, 1% of your body weight

86
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,360
 would be almost a kilo.

87
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,360
 - What are my clothes?

88
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,280
 What are my clothes weigh?

89
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,840
 I don't know.

90
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,680
 - Let's weigh your clothes now.

91
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,960
 - No, let's not take them all off now and weigh them.

92
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:46,280
 (laughing)

93
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,600
 - But you do have a good point

94
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:50,880
 because magpies do have a reputation for being dicks.

95
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:53,080
 They, but falsely.

96
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:57,520
 So basically only eight to 10% of magpies will swoop people.

97
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:01,200
 Only the male magpies and only in one month of the year.

98
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,440
 - Hashtag not all magpies.

99
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:03,440
 - Yeah, exactly.

100
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:04,600
 - Well, this is a really interesting thing

101
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:07,520
 because magpies are over on this side of the planet as well.

102
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:09,000
 But Aussie magpies,

103
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,400
 they're actually a different species to the European magpie.

104
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,240
 That's just not anything to do with each other.

105
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,480
 So I remember saying to people,

106
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:18,160
 oh, magpie swoop and that being an alien concept here,

107
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,120
 but you live in Australia.

108
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,520
 You know the danger, the fear of walking down a street

109
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:24,360
 and a magpie swooping on you.

110
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,400
 - And the problem is, because they're very smart

111
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,040
 and they recognize faces,

112
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:30,240
 if they decide that they don't like you,

113
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,880
 they will target you.

114
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:34,680
 So some people will just get swooped every day

115
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,200
 on their way to work.

116
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:38,160
 And so that's why they've earned that reputation.

117
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,000
 - Have you been swooped?

118
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,800
 - I have been swooped once in my life,

119
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,760
 but my boyfriend loves birds a lot.

120
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:45,040
 And he has decided when we first moved to Australia,

121
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:48,600
 he was gonna become friends with all the magpies.

122
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,640
 So that's the other thing,

123
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:51,160
 because they can recognize your face,

124
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:53,680
 you can actually make a friend for life.

125
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,080
 And they stay in the same neighborhood.

126
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,440
 So if you move into a neighborhood

127
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:57,760
 and there are magpies there,

128
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:00,600
 they will be the same magpies for like 20 years.

129
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:03,160
 - See, it's really high stakes when you move in.

130
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:05,520
 You've got a chance to make a good impression.

131
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,720
 And if you blow it, long-term grudges are held.

132
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:10,000
 - I know you mean, but they only usually live

133
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,240
 for about five years.

134
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:14,080
 - Can't the family, like in the mafia,

135
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,560
 remember and bear a grudge?

136
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,200
 Didn't we save, I mean, that was crows,

137
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,400
 we were talking about ages and ages ago,

138
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:20,720
 I think crows, bear a grudge.

139
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,880
 - They do, yes.

140
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:25,360
 And the school children are often targeted by magpies

141
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,560
 because they often wear school uniforms.

142
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:30,960
 So if one child has thrown a rock at a magpie,

143
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,720
 they will then view all children as threats.

144
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,560
 And so they'll just attack.

145
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:37,600
 Same with like if they determine

146
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,520
 if you're wearing like something covering your face

147
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,840
 or your head, say a bicelmet.

148
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,160
 They view that as a threat of like,

149
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:45,160
 what are you hiding from?

150
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:47,720
 And then they will then swoop you for that.

151
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,760
 - Does anyone come across Emma Glenfield

152
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:50,880
 when you're doing this research?

153
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:51,720
 - No.

154
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,040
 - So we were talking about school kids.

155
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:56,480
 She was in Australia and she'd been watching people

156
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:58,480
 be swooped by these magpies.

157
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:01,360
 And she thought, it seems to me like they're going

158
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,960
 for bold people more, the bold teachers,

159
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:06,040
 they seem to be going for the bold teachers.

160
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,840
 And she asked her mom, is this a thing?

161
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,600
 And her mom said, well, I don't know if it's a thing,

162
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,720
 you know, do your homework or whatever.

163
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,600
 And anyway, she decided to do a study.

164
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,040
 So she went to her school

165
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:18,400
 and she watched as these magpies swooped people

166
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,160
 and then did a survey of anyone who'd been swooped saying,

167
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,560
 you know, how tall are you?

168
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,200
 What's your hairstyle?

169
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,200
 What sex are you?

170
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,600
 All that kind of stuff.

171
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,440
 - What's your hairstyle?

172
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:28,280
 None.

173
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:30,520
 (laughing)

174
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:34,720
 - Well, then she's supposed to have 100 people

175
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:37,120
 around the school, but then it went online

176
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,960
 and she got 30,000 people to participate

177
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,920
 on her survey online.

178
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:44,160
 And she found that statistically,

179
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:47,400
 magpies are more likely to go for bold people.

180
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:50,480
 And according to a magpie expert called Darryl Jones,

181
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:54,320
 her study is the first time anyone's ever examined this link.

182
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:56,200
 And so she's doing brand new science

183
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,600
 and learn this about people.

184
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,480
 - So you know what bold people should do then?

185
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:01,360
 Draw a face on the back of their head.

186
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,200
 - What?

187
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:05,800
 - Magpies are less likely to go at anything that has eyes.

188
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,760
 And so if they're swooping from behind,

189
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,640
 they're just seeing a bold head all together.

190
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:10,800
 - Oh, that could be icy.

191
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,520
 - Yeah, so there are a few things

192
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:14,000
 that people think they've worked out

193
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,400
 that magpies won't sweep out.

194
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:17,080
 One is if you have eyes at the back of your head.

195
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:20,240
 So people often cyclists might often wear glasses,

196
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,840
 sunglasses on the back of their head facing that way

197
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:24,200
 to give the impression there are eyes there.

198
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:26,040
 - A bit like in, is it in Africa,

199
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:26,880
 we might have said before,

200
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:29,200
 where they draw eyes on the bums of cows?

201
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,040
 - Yes, exactly.

202
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,080
 - Stop them being attacked by lions.

203
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:31,920
 - Yeah.

204
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:32,760
 - That's why that.

205
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:33,600
 - 'Cause you can't be sneaked up on.

206
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:36,400
 - It's so funny, they're a protected national species.

207
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:39,160
 So if a magpie attacks you, you can't attack it back.

208
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,560
 - You kind of just have to let it happen.

209
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,400
 - Really?

210
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:42,240
 - Yeah.

211
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,080
 - That's funny.

212
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:44,280
 - And so what they do then is if they've identified

213
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:47,680
 an aggressive magpie, they have to ship him out of there.

214
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:48,880
 But there's a minimum distance,

215
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:50,440
 which is like 25 kilometers.

216
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:52,480
 So because they'll just fly back.

217
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:55,400
 - They don't respect the restraining order.

218
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:57,440
 - Have you heard of the Windsor Road monster?

219
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,280
 - No.

220
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:01,880
 - That's an Australian magpie, specific one,

221
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:03,400
 which was especially aggressive

222
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,560
 and had to be put down in the end.

223
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:07,100
 But it took a very long time.

224
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:08,760
 I have to say, the Windsor Road monster

225
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:11,520
 has given multiple chances to learn and change.

226
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:14,520
 And it attacks, well, there were more than 40 complaints.

227
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:17,480
 One person had a heart attack shortly after being swooped,

228
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:18,720
 which is not the fact.

229
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,760
 - You know, there could be other things happening

230
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:23,040
 in that person's life that makes them more susceptible

231
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:23,880
 to a heart attack.

232
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:24,720
 - That's not true.

233
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,560
 - It's not necessarily the--

234
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:26,640
 - That's true, that's true.

235
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:28,040
 But it didn't, no, you're right.

236
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,200
 But it was going for people's faces.

237
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:32,000
 It was going under cyclist's helmets to get them.

238
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,320
 It was even for an Australian magpie,

239
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,160
 it was being especially aggressive.

240
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:37,200
 - You're bowled under there, mate.

241
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,640
 - What's going on?

242
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:39,760
 Where are you hiding?

243
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,960
 - They're just trying to protect their ground.

244
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:45,840
 They spend most of their life just protecting their area.

245
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:48,880
 So they choose their radius, and it's quite small.

246
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:51,240
 And they will just spend the whole time just standing,

247
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:54,400
 like, as bounces on the edge of their patch,

248
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:57,480
 being like, don't come in here all the time.

249
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:59,600
 - So there was one cyclist who I read about

250
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,560
 called Dr. Richard Osborne,

251
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:04,120
 who came up with this new cycle helmet.

252
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:07,240
 - I don't think I've seen this.

253
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:08,440
 - Does it have a face on it?

254
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:09,440
 - No, it doesn't have a face.

255
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,560
 Can you guess what it is?

256
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:14,080
 He uses a thing I have around my house

257
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,080
 to scare them away.

258
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,320
 - So I know this, so I won't guess.

259
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,520
 - Yeah, okay, melts out.

260
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:21,040
 - I could have seemed really smart.

261
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:23,880
 - Oh, stop using James' personality to look out for it.

262
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:25,200
 - It was a golf club.

263
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,400
 - What do you know about things that happened in my life

264
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,960
 in the last two weeks?

265
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:29,920
 - The last two weeks?

266
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,840
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

267
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,040
 All my family members.

268
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:36,880
 - Your kid has had a birthday.

269
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:37,720
 - Yeah.

270
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,360
 - Your daughter's two years old.

271
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,200
 - Yeah.

272
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,120
 - So you see, you put the hours in with people then.

273
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:47,120
 - What a way to find out that's your daughter's birthday.

274
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,680
 (all laughing)

275
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:50,760
 - Oh no, Uncle Dan hasn't forgotten about you.

276
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,600
 No, no, he's been very busy.

277
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,440
 I'm sure the gifts on its way.

278
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:55,280
 - Oh my God.

279
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:58,560
 - She built a helmet to ward Dan away, I think, yeah.

280
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:01,920
 - Does the bike have a mortal baby pinioned on top of it?

281
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,320
 - A little bit or a doll.

282
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:05,520
 - It has, you know, these party blowers

283
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:07,160
 where you blow them and they go, pfft.

284
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:08,600
 And they kind of stick out.

285
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,720
 He has those attached to his helmet

286
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,760
 and there's a tube attached to them.

287
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:14,720
 So the, and Magpie comes there,

288
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:17,000
 he blows into the tube and they all go, pfft.

289
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,200
 - Is this what you were thinking, though?

290
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,040
 - No.

291
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:21,280
 (all laughing)

292
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:23,960
 - I just see the guy who had tied a lot of cable ties

293
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:24,800
 to his hair.

294
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:25,800
 - That's very funny.

295
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:28,720
 - And does he, has it sort of caught on?

296
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,320
 - Yeah, well, no, it's not caught on

297
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,640
 because he looks like an idiot,

298
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:35,320
 but you said it seemed a bit safer than carrying a stick

299
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:37,240
 and waving it around, which was his other option.

300
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:39,040
 - Yeah, or having spikes, which a lot of people do,

301
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:41,520
 they're not sharp spikes, but they are sticky out.

302
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:42,360
 - Is that right?

303
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,200
 - Yeah, yeah, just as a deterrent.

304
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:46,280
 - The best thing to do is to just be nice to them.

305
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:47,120
 - Yeah.

306
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:47,960
 - Because they will remember you being nice.

307
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,680
 So what happens is people run away and they go,

308
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,800
 oh, you are guilty, why are you running?

309
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:55,720
 Therefore, it just fills this prophecy in their head.

310
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,720
 - But to be nice to them, if you're in their area,

311
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:59,200
 so you just, how can you be nice?

312
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,160
 - You just feed them.

313
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,720
 You just leave them out like little peanuts and things.

314
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,440
 That's what my boyfriend has been trying to do,

315
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:07,760
 like leaving peanuts outside our yard and getting them to come.

316
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,440
 And yes, and then when they like you,

317
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,400
 they'll bring their kids along to be like,

318
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:13,640
 here's my kids, you miss the good day.

319
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:17,320
 - One nice thing that you can do for them

320
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:19,760
 is actually something that will get you in trouble with them,

321
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:22,280
 which is if you see one of their babies struggling

322
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:23,240
 and you go to help it,

323
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:25,360
 they will view that as you hurting their babies

324
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,720
 'cause they haven't introduced you to it.

325
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,520
 So be careful how nice you are.

326
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:30,920
 - And that's why you didn't give a gift.

327
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:33,000
 As nice as they viewed as a threat.

328
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,200
 - Playgrounds, playgrounds are like that, you know.

329
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,040
 - Are they?

330
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:36,960
 - Well, if you see a child that's struggling

331
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:37,960
 and you go over to help it,

332
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:38,800
 their parents might think,

333
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,400
 "Who's this guy who's approaching my child?"

334
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,240
 - Yes.

335
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:42,080
 (laughing)

336
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:42,920
 - "This guy's left the fence.

337
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:44,280
 "I can't remember not to wear my costume

338
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:45,120
 "when I'm doing that."

339
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,720
 (laughing)

340
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,200
 - I'm weighing my clothes.

341
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:50,440
 (laughing)

342
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:54,920
 - Do you have lots of superstitions about them in Australia?

343
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:56,720
 - I have heard of these superstitions,

344
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:00,520
 but I don't think I follow them in my day to day life.

345
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:02,680
 - 'Cause that's pretty much what they're well known for here,

346
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:03,520
 right?

347
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:04,360
 - Yeah, I follow quite a few.

348
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:05,480
 - So when you see one,

349
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:07,400
 do you say like, "Hello, Mr. Magpie.

350
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:09,400
 "Where's your wife?" or something?

351
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:10,240
 - Good morning, my Lord,

352
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,060
 and how's your wife and children?

353
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:11,900
 Yes.

354
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:12,740
 - Right.

355
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:13,580
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

356
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:14,400
 - And do you do that?

357
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,240
 - I do, yeah.

358
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,400
 - And what about if you see one on its own?

359
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,080
 Seeing two is fine, three is fine, whatever.

360
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:20,520
 And one on its own, bad luck, so you just quickly, you know.

361
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:22,240
 - 'Cause in Australia, that's a lot to get out

362
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,840
 while it's coming for your eyes, isn't it?

363
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:26,280
 - Yeah, exactly, that's very, ah!

364
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:28,160
 That's it, yeah, that's what I'm gonna say, yeah.

365
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:30,680
 But no, there are all these things,

366
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:33,160
 like the magpie landed on the cross

367
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:35,160
 when Christ was being crucified,

368
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:37,880
 or the tongue of a magpie contains a drop of blood

369
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:39,400
 from the devil himself.

370
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:41,120
 - I think if they open their mouth,

371
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:43,180
 there is a little bit of red in there, isn't there?

372
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:46,080
 I think that's why they associated with Jesus.

373
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:47,320
 - And that's why if you scratch its tongue

374
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:48,620
 with the edge of a silver sixpence

375
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:50,360
 and put a drop of blood into the wound,

376
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:52,280
 it will gain the power of speech.

377
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:55,840
 (all laughing)

378
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:56,820
 - We've all been there.

379
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:57,840
 (all laughing)

380
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,360
 - There's so much slander about them

381
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,360
 from back in the day, particularly religious.

382
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:04,440
 So the one about the crucifix, apparently,

383
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:06,320
 it was the only bird not to cry

384
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:10,080
 when Jesus was crucified, and that was big news.

385
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,920
 And then in the 19th century, there was a vicar

386
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,240
 who said it was the only bird

387
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:14,920
 that refused to go on Noah's Ark,

388
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:19,160
 rather it just wanted, it hung outside swearing instead.

389
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:21,760
 In France, the idea is that a magpie

390
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:24,960
 is a reincarnated evil nun.

391
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:26,320
 - I can see it, I guess.

392
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,600
 (all laughing)

393
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,960
 - British magpies eat a lot of dog poo.

394
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:31,880
 - Oh, wow. - Yeah.

395
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:33,240
 Even if there's other food around,

396
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:34,720
 they'll eat the dog. - Really?

397
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:35,560
 - Yeah, yeah.

398
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:38,400
 And to such the extent that people in parks

399
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,680
 have noticed that they'll,

400
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,840
 'cause they're quite smart, obviously, magpies,

401
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:44,280
 they'll go to the dog poo bins,

402
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:45,920
 pull out a bag of dog poo,

403
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,600
 rip open the bag of dog poo,

404
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:48,880
 and then have a little snack.

405
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,200
 - Oh, my God. - Oh, my God.

406
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,640
 - That's some self-respect.

407
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:53,320
 - What? - That was awful.

408
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:55,200
 - It was nutritious. - Might taste great.

409
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,120
 - I've never tried it, I don't know if it's good or not.

410
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,440
 - Oh. (all laughing)

411
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,800
 - I just wanted to say, we don't know.

412
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:01,080
 - You said, "Might taste great."

413
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:01,920
 - Yeah. - And I heard you saying,

414
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:02,880
 "Mine tastes great."

415
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:03,720
 (all laughing)

416
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:05,960
 - Actually, I'm just gonna gloss on the move past it,

417
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:07,880
 'cause, you know, we've got a guest.

418
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,200
 - You guys at a park,

419
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,600
 is that you're trying to go through the dog poo,

420
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,400
 you're naked at a playground.

421
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:14,240
 (all laughing)

422
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,400
 It's a whole image.

423
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:18,400
 - James has got a party before he was scammed out his head.

424
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,880
 - Yeah. - Oh, my God.

425
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:21,360
 - They do have them in New Zealand.

426
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,480
 - They do, yes. - My pies, don't they?

427
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,640
 But they've come over from Australia.

428
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:26,920
 Apparently, no one's trying to get rid of them in New Zealand.

429
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:27,920
 You know, like in New Zealand,

430
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,600
 there's quite a lot of invasive species

431
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:30,600
 and they're trying to get rid of them.

432
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,280
 Well, they're not doing it with my pies

433
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:34,040
 because it's too hard, basically.

434
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,880
 - Yeah. - You get rid of two magpies

435
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:39,600
 from an area and then the next two will move in.

436
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,600
 But apparently, what I read is they've got

437
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:45,520
 a bad reputation in New Zealand, these magpies,

438
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:47,640
 because they're big, showy, noisy,

439
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:50,720
 and according to the article, it must be said, "Australian."

440
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,880
 - Oh, yes. (laughing)

441
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,920
 That really does rub us the wrong way.

442
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:56,600
 That's how I can understand it.

443
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,840
 (laughing)

444
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:01,640
 - Did you hear of these acclimatisation societies?

445
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:03,080
 - Yes. - 'Cause that was,

446
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:04,200
 they're Australian magpies,

447
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:07,440
 but they were introduced to New Zealand by societies saying,

448
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,680
 I'm not sure what the rationale was actually,

449
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:10,360
 'cause it was not as though they were gonna be hunted or--

450
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:12,040
 - Well, they thought that there wasn't enough

451
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:14,560
 nice animals in New Zealand.

452
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:17,200
 - And in fact, I've heard that a lot, yeah, famously.

453
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:19,720
 - Yeah, well, they were like, you know, there's not--

454
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:23,480
 - There's no endemic mammals to New Zealand,

455
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:27,320
 apart from a bat, so any mammals weren't really there.

456
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:29,440
 - They got there, and they're like, "Where's the rabbits?"

457
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,280
 - Yeah. - You know,

458
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:31,640
 "Where's the tweeting birds?"

459
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:33,200
 We don't know where they are.

460
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:35,920
 - But I feel like it's such a bird-heavy place,

461
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,920
 or certainly would have been in the 19th century,

462
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:40,760
 as in, why would you introduce more birds, you know?

463
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:42,800
 - Yeah, they're like, maybe some that can fly

464
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:45,120
 would be useful. - Yeah, exactly.

465
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,880
 Like the cacophore, that's a New Zealand one as well.

466
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,120
 - Yeah, but a lot of them kind of hide

467
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:50,600
 in the middle of the night. - Yeah, yeah.

468
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:54,560
 - Even the kiwi bird, I don't think I've ever seen one.

469
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:55,880
 - Really? - You go to the zoo,

470
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:59,240
 and they say they're in there, but I don't reckon they are.

471
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:01,000
 I think it's just they've put a red light

472
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,360
 in a cave-looking area, and they go, "There's kiwi in there."

473
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:06,040
 (all laugh)

474
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:08,600
 - Tasmanian devils, I've gone every year

475
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:11,000
 to see a Tasmanian devil at Taronga Zoo in Sydney,

476
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,040
 and you never see one.

477
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:13,800
 - You never see them spinning around like a tornado.

478
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,440
 - Yeah, no, no, no, no.

479
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:18,400
 - You do hear a little bit of that in the background, but yeah.

480
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:20,980
 (upbeat music)

481
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:25,880
 - Okay, it is time for fact number two, that is James.

482
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:28,840
 - Okay, my fact this week is that the sport of netball

483
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:32,000
 was invented because its creator thought basketball

484
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,080
 made women grow better and lose control.

485
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:37,320
 - Wow, as a player of both sports,

486
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:38,720
 I will say this is true.

487
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,880
 (laughs)

488
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,920
 I play social netball, you know,

489
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:45,040
 and it's always very wholesome.

490
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:47,680
 The slogan of netball is just, "Here if you need,"

491
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:49,160
 it's so beautiful.

492
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:50,400
 That's just what you say a lot, you know,

493
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:52,000
 when you pass the ball, you go, "Here if you need,"

494
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,560
 like, you know, like, "Pass them on me,"

495
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:55,840
 you say, "Here if you need," like, "I'm over here."

496
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:57,840
 It's very wholesome, but then I play basketball

497
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:59,680
 and I become a feral beast.

498
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:01,280
 (all laugh)

499
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:02,600
 - It's so interesting.

500
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:05,200
 - So what's the key difference that causes that?

501
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:07,080
 - I don't know if this is--

502
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:09,120
 - Well, basketball is technically no contact.

503
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:11,600
 - But you're trying to take the ball off someone

504
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:12,840
 and you can run beside them.

505
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:15,680
 So basics of netball is once you catch the ball,

506
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:17,000
 you can't move.

507
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,040
 If you're taking a shot, no one can defend you.

508
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:21,080
 - They can, with three feet away.

509
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:23,040
 - From three feet away, which is, I would argue,

510
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:23,880
 too many feet.

511
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:25,200
 (all laugh)

512
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,480
 - And you can't dribble along the court.

513
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,200
 - You can't dribble, okay, okay, okay, okay.

514
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:32,280
 - So anyway, this all comes from a woman called Clara Bear

515
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:35,000
 who was working at Newcombe College in New Orleans,

516
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,240
 and she'd been asked to come up with a new sport

517
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:39,880
 for women to play because this was an old women's school.

518
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:42,160
 And she decided, she came up with a few ideas,

519
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:44,360
 but her main one was to adapt sports

520
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:45,840
 of being played by men.

521
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:48,200
 So basketball had just become really popular,

522
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:51,320
 been invented by James Naismith a few years earlier.

523
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:54,080
 And so she wrote to him and asked for the rules.

524
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,240
 She got the rules and said, right,

525
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,760
 we're gonna play basketball.

526
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:59,600
 But anyone who was there said it was a mad game

527
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:02,480
 in which the women grew bitter and lost control.

528
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:05,800
 Even she herself said it was not entirely satisfactory.

529
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:07,320
 And so she thought, well, I'm gonna have to invent

530
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:09,160
 a new game which doesn't have all this stuff

531
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:11,440
 because this is just not appropriate to women.

532
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:12,880
 And so she came up with that ball.

533
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:13,880
 - Interesting.

534
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:16,080
 You say that netball is a non-contact sport,

535
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:18,240
 but I don't think it actually is

536
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,800
 because non-contact would be something like tennis

537
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,960
 where you genuinely don't touch anyone else.

538
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,240
 But netball, there are certain rules.

539
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:27,280
 So if I was to run into the space to get the ball

540
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:28,880
 and someone else is running in

541
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:31,160
 and I shoulder barge them on the way,

542
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:33,160
 that is really one of the rules of the game.

543
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:36,120
 Like there is, the art of learning to play netball

544
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:39,040
 is to learn how to be very aggressive

545
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:40,600
 within the confines of the rules.

546
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:42,360
 - Oh, yeah, yeah, okay.

547
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:44,040
 Yeah, we used to play it at school.

548
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:45,480
 And I went to a city.

549
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:46,560
 Yeah, I went to a Steiner school.

550
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:47,880
 So I think that was more,

551
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:49,600
 feels like a made up Steiner sport, really.

552
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,840
 Steiner's a very hippie non-competitive kind of thing.

553
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,520
 And it feels like instead of basketball,

554
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:54,960
 let's do netball instead.

555
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,280
 - So can I check a few more rules?

556
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:57,120
 - Yeah.

557
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:59,520
 - So Mel, is there still no shouting

558
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,480
 or talking during the game?

559
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:02,400
 Is that still observed?

560
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,160
 - Interesting.

561
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,320
 Where is that from?

562
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:07,280
 Is that from the most recent rule?

563
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:10,520
 - That was from Clara Bear's founding rules

564
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:11,680
 right off the game.

565
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:13,480
 - You can't talk back to the umpire,

566
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:15,880
 so you couldn't say, "Oh, what was that?"

567
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:17,200
 - In the first rules for sure,

568
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,560
 if you spoke, if you said anything in the game,

569
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:20,600
 it was a foul.

570
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:21,440
 - Oh, wow!

571
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,480
 - Even here if you need.

572
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,200
 - Yeah, you won't have to say that.

573
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:27,840
 - I read no falling over was also a rid, which I can't.

574
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,360
 - Don't struggle to compute.

575
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:30,880
 - That seems a bit harsh, doesn't it?

576
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:31,720
 - Yeah, it does.

577
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:34,640
 - It's a weird rule that there's sort of a hangover there.

578
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,560
 If you catch the ball and you fall over,

579
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:37,640
 you're not allowed to move with the ball,

580
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:39,560
 but if you are on the ground,

581
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:41,680
 you can't throw the ball from the ground.

582
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:42,520
 - What?

583
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:44,200
 - So you have to make your way back up to standing

584
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:46,080
 before you can throw the ball.

585
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:47,560
 But you have to keep your feet planted.

586
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:49,600
 So where your feet landed when you fell over,

587
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,160
 you have to just weirdly stand up.

588
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:54,000
 - Do you look like one of those inflatable car selling

589
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,320
 balloon guns?

590
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:57,440
 - You just have to rise up, yeah.

591
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:58,560
 - That's great, that's brilliant.

592
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:00,400
 - That's a good rule, I like that.

593
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:04,400
 - She also said no needlessly rough play was in her rules.

594
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:07,560
 And all shots had to be taken with one hand.

595
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:09,880
 Because there was a thought that by throwing it

596
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:11,840
 with two hands, it was unladylike

597
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:15,400
 and might somehow make women less feminine was the idea.

598
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:18,560
 - I read there would be inclination of the shoulders forward

599
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:21,200
 with consequent flattening of the chest.

600
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,040
 - Precisely, yeah.

601
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:24,000
 - And that would not be a graceful position for girls.

602
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:24,840
 - That's what they said.

603
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:26,680
 But it's interesting because the one-handed throw

604
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:28,920
 was in netball from the very start,

605
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:30,200
 they had one-handed throw.

606
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,840
 But in basketball, there was none of it

607
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:33,120
 until about the 1930s.

608
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:35,480
 It was all two-handed throwing into the baskets.

609
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:36,480
 - As a rule, was it?

610
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:37,640
 - No, it's just that was the way.

611
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:38,800
 - That was the way they did it, yeah.

612
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:41,440
 - Yeah, I love as well that she basically,

613
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,400
 she originally was starting basketball

614
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:45,040
 as a female version of it.

615
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:47,360
 And she called it basketball.

616
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:49,840
 She just changed it to QUE.

617
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,240
 - Well, I think what happened there is,

618
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:53,840
 she wrote to Naismith who came up with the original thing.

619
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:57,120
 And she said, here's my new sport, what do you think?

620
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,360
 It's women's basketball.

621
00:20:58,360 --> 00:20:59,520
 And he wrote back saying, well,

622
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:01,240
 it's not really the same as basketball.

623
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:03,000
 So you should change the name a little bit.

624
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,840
 And she said, okay, I'll change it to basketball.

625
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:07,280
 - And then part of the rules were developed

626
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:09,440
 because she just misunderstood what he'd sent back.

627
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:11,040
 There were dots all over it.

628
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:13,800
 And she took that to mean seven different zones.

629
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:15,600
 So you would be stuck in your zone.

630
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,880
 And that got applied to the initial rules.

631
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:18,960
 - We should not still change.

632
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:22,680
 - Yeah, yeah, a goalkeeper is still in one-third of the court.

633
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:25,480
 A center can go in most of the court, but not the two.

634
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:26,480
 It's very complicated.

635
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:28,200
 - It's not very sociable, is it?

636
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:31,120
 Like if, yeah, there's some people who never really see it.

637
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:31,960
 - Exactly.

638
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:34,560
 Like I will chat to a goal shooter as a goalkeeper a lot,

639
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:37,280
 but I will never see my team's goal shooter.

640
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:38,840
 I just go, oh, well done.

641
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:40,280
 (all laughing)

642
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:43,680
 - But it's safe and the women look very womenly as a result.

643
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:45,600
 (all laughing)

644
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,440
 - What a relief.

645
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:48,480
 - The vision has remained from Clara Bear.

646
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:49,840
 - Do you play volleyball as well, Mel?

647
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:50,680
 - I don't.

648
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:53,240
 I just play netball and basketball, yeah.

649
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:56,560
 - 'Cause apparently volleyball may have been nicked

650
00:21:56,560 --> 00:22:00,320
 basically a month after the first game of Newcombe ball,

651
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:03,000
 which was another, Clara Bear invented Newcombe ball,

652
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,520
 but you throw the ball into the other team's area

653
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:05,880
 so it hits the floor.

654
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:06,720
 - Yes.

655
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:07,640
 - Without them being able to catch it.

656
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:10,080
 One month after that first game was written up,

657
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:13,360
 William Morgan, the YMCA director in the USA,

658
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:14,840
 he invented volleyball.

659
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:16,560
 And it was basically apparently for older businessmen

660
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:18,680
 on their lunch hour, was how it was described.

661
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:20,120
 Which I think it has not stayed true to

662
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:21,640
 over the years, volleyball.

663
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:23,160
 - You know beach volleyball?

664
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:24,000
 - Yeah.

665
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,520
 - There's an official rule that you're only allowed

666
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:27,440
 to wear one watch.

667
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:28,280
 - Oh, really?

668
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:29,800
 - It's in the actual rules.

669
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:31,120
 It says only one watch allowed.

670
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:33,600
 - What possible advantage do you gain from two watches?

671
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:34,440
 - What do you think?

672
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:35,280
 - How interesting.

673
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:37,400
 - Do you know what time it is in another part of the club?

674
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:39,080
 (all laughing)

675
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:40,160
 - Do you know the answer?

676
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:41,000
 - I think I do, yeah.

677
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,600
 - Okay, so what advantage would you have?

678
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:43,840
 - I mean, you'd never get a point.

679
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:45,000
 - I have a punt.

680
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
 Is it that people were doing sponsorship deals

681
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,440
 with multiple watch companies?

682
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:49,760
 - I can't believe that today.

683
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:50,600
 - Interesting.

684
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:51,440
 - Oh, that's great.

685
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:52,360
 - 'Cause there's actually some rules

686
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:55,800
 about how many temporary tattoos you're allowed

687
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:57,360
 because people use those for appetizers.

688
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:58,200
 - No.

689
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:59,040
 - Obviously, don't have--

690
00:22:59,040 --> 00:22:59,880
 - Small real estate.

691
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:00,720
 - Yeah.

692
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,080
 (all laughing)

693
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:02,920
 - Exactly.

694
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:03,760
 - Yeah.

695
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:04,600
 - It's so funny, isn't it?

696
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:06,920
 - Because netball is so big in New Zealand and Australia.

697
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:09,680
 I wasn't sure how much you guys knew about the sport.

698
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:10,920
 I know you play in England.

699
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:12,840
 You've got a very popular team.

700
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:14,880
 But I was like, oh, I wonder what some unknown facts

701
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:15,720
 about netball.

702
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:18,840
 So of course, I looked it up and I found an article titled

703
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:22,560
 "Fascinating Facts About Netball That You Never Knew."

704
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:25,840
 Number one was, "How long is a netball game?"

705
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:27,480
 (all laughing)

706
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:28,400
 - Okay, well, let's try.

707
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,720
 Does anyone here know how long it is?

708
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:30,760
 - Actually, I do not know.

709
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:33,720
 I would guess it's 80 minutes.

710
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:34,840
 - Oh, I think it's less.

711
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:38,000
 I've watched games, but I can't remember how long they were.

712
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,160
 I reckon maybe 60 minutes and quarters.

713
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:41,160
 - Yeah, that's what I'm thinking.

714
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:42,920
 I'm trying to work out, is it quarters as well?

715
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:43,920
 And so I'm gonna say 60,

716
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:45,120
 'cause I heard you just say yes.

717
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:47,160
 (all laughing)

718
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:49,360
 - Yes, I acknowledge your answer and it's incorrect.

719
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:51,000
 No, no, it is actually.

720
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,760
 It's for 15 minute quarters.

721
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:54,080
 - Fascinating fact.

722
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:55,140
 - Yes, fascinating fact.

723
00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:57,440
 - Number two, "What is netball?"

724
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,920
 (all laughing)

725
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:02,400
 I think it's a real entry-level article,

726
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,920
 that I had come across.

727
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:06,760
 - I love the way that the first thing you need to learn

728
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:07,720
 is how long it is.

729
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:10,120
 And then the second one is, "What is it?"

730
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:11,520
 It's like, "Do you wanna play netball?"

731
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:12,800
 Well, how long will it be?

732
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:13,640
 (all laughing)

733
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:14,480
 - 60 minutes.

734
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:15,320
 It's got two watches on.

735
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:17,800
 (all laughing)

736
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:18,640
 - You're right.

737
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,760
 So I grew up in Oz for my teenage years.

738
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:22,360
 Netball was massive there,

739
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:24,080
 and I assumed it was globally massive.

740
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:25,980
 It's an American invention, but in America,

741
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:26,940
 it's not really played.

742
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:28,220
 It's getting back now,

743
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:30,220
 and particularly Aussies and New Zealanders

744
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:33,020
 keep going over to schools to try and reintegrate it.

745
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:36,380
 So Ross Day is someone who went over to try and get it done.

746
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:38,500
 And she said, "What are the biggest challenges?"

747
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:40,260
 I can't believe this is true.

748
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:41,220
 Must be target cheek.

749
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:42,540
 She says, "One of the biggest challenges

750
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:44,180
 "is that when we're pitching netball,

751
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:46,900
 "is that because of our accents being Aussie and New Zealand,

752
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:48,460
 "everyone thinks we're saying nipple."

753
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:53,460
 - Yes, I get this, I will say something about nipple,

754
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:56,240
 and I'll be like, "Oh, that was a great netball play."

755
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:59,040
 And it has a whole different meaning.

756
00:24:59,040 --> 00:24:59,880
 And the comments, people are like,

757
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:01,960
 "What are you talking about?"

758
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:03,840
 - Wow, so someone will come up to you and say,

759
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,920
 "Do you want a better nipple play?"

760
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:07,740
 And you go, "How long will it be?"

761
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:09,600
 (all laughing)

762
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:10,440
 - Wait, quick double check.

763
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:11,280
 It is what you think it is.

764
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:12,440
 What is nipple?

765
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:14,680
 (all laughing)

766
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:15,840
 - That's so funny.

767
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:18,680
 - I like the early forms of basketball

768
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:19,960
 were interesting as well.

769
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:23,740
 I like how they first started with a peach basket,

770
00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:26,700
 but they didn't think to put a hole in the bottom.

771
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:30,460
 So, in the early games, they would have to stop the game

772
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:32,580
 to go retrieve the ball from the basket

773
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:34,220
 and climb up a ladder.

774
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:36,700
 - I suppose, in a way, if you have a hole,

775
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:38,780
 it's not always certain if the ball's gone in.

776
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:40,100
 - Yeah, that is true.

777
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:41,060
 - Is that producing netball?

778
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:42,740
 - Sometimes, if I shoot in it,

779
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:44,460
 'cause you go for the swish sound,

780
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:46,620
 but sometimes you could just shoot so far

781
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:48,940
 that it just hits the net and makes that sound anyway.

782
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:50,640
 And you go, "Oh, okay, I know."

783
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,460
 (all laughing)

784
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:55,860
 - In football, in soccer, there's been this thing

785
00:25:55,860 --> 00:25:59,560
 where you have a board next to the goal.

786
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:01,120
 I think it was in Queen's Park Rangers,

787
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:03,380
 and they scored a goal, and it hit the board,

788
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:05,040
 and then bounced straight back out again,

789
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:07,520
 and the goal didn't get given, because, yeah.

790
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:08,800
 - I don't understand how that,

791
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:10,420
 so it hit the board next to the--

792
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:11,420
 - So, it's gone into the net?

793
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:12,680
 - Yeah, sorry, I didn't explain that very well.

794
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:14,500
 So, you've got the goal, the goal post,

795
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:15,640
 and you've got the net,

796
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:17,120
 but then you've got an advertising board

797
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:18,880
 right behind the goal.

798
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:22,100
 And so, the ball goes in, hits the advertising board,

799
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:23,740
 bounces straight back out again,

800
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:25,660
 and the referee goes, "Well, I didn't see it go in."

801
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:26,500
 - Oh!

802
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:29,060
 - And it happened quite recently

803
00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:30,580
 where there was a hole in the net,

804
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:32,260
 as in one that wasn't supposed to be there,

805
00:26:32,260 --> 00:26:33,580
 a bigger than the normal hole.

806
00:26:33,580 --> 00:26:34,420
 (all laughing)

807
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:36,860
 And the ball went in, and it went through the hole,

808
00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:38,860
 and no one could tell whether it had gone in or not.

809
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:39,700
 That's good.

810
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:40,820
 - That's a good thing for a goalie to do

811
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:42,020
 when the action's happening up the other end.

812
00:26:42,020 --> 00:26:42,860
 (all laughing)

813
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:44,100
 It's like somebody's saw through the net,

814
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:45,780
 and then you'll be behind the saw.

815
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:47,180
 (all laughing)

816
00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:48,500
 - Like Wiley Clay.

817
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:50,340
 (all laughing)

818
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:52,220
 - Did you, when you were sort of part

819
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:54,060
 of the New Zealand netball scene,

820
00:26:54,060 --> 00:26:59,180
 did you, do you know anyone who played for the Master Baiters?

821
00:26:59,180 --> 00:27:01,340
 (all laughing)

822
00:27:01,340 --> 00:27:02,420
 Do you remember this?

823
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:03,460
 - No.

824
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:04,300
 - Okay. - I mean--

825
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:06,220
 - It was just a cheeky little fun New Zealand thing,

826
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:09,220
 but there was a Sydney World Masters games

827
00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:10,780
 where all netball teams were coming,

828
00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:12,740
 and there was a lot of New Zealand teams

829
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:13,580
 that were coming over,

830
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:15,020
 and they named themselves the Master Baiters,

831
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:16,820
 and-- - Why?

832
00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:18,620
 - Well, it was a Masters,

833
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:21,620
 and they were baiting, so with the Master Baiters.

834
00:27:21,620 --> 00:27:22,860
 - Yeah, the second baiting?

835
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:24,980
 - Yeah, that was it. - What were they baiting?

836
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:26,900
 - Baiting the other teams.

837
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:28,780
 - Oh, I see. - Okay.

838
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:29,620
 - I didn't come up with it.

839
00:27:29,620 --> 00:27:31,740
 (all laughing)

840
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:35,300
 - I like how the sport of netball's evolved quite a lot.

841
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:37,220
 There's different versions of this fast five,

842
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:40,180
 which is basically, they've made it more like basketball.

843
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:41,860
 There's five people on the court,

844
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:43,620
 and there's, you can shoot three-point,

845
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:45,820
 or two-pointers and things.

846
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:48,300
 The Northern Mystics used a new move

847
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:50,580
 called the Harrison Hoist,

848
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:53,900
 because you have to be three feet away,

849
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:57,940
 and so they had been practicing like a cheerleader lift,

850
00:27:57,940 --> 00:28:00,180
 and so she'd lifted her up,

851
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:02,420
 and she was able to bat the ball over there

852
00:28:02,420 --> 00:28:04,580
 as it was going into the hoop. - Is that allowed?

853
00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:05,580
 - And yeah, it's allowed.

854
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:07,180
 It was in the rules of the game,

855
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:08,260
 and they were going to go,

856
00:28:08,260 --> 00:28:09,740
 "Oh, we'll save this for the finals,"

857
00:28:09,740 --> 00:28:10,580
 but then they were like,

858
00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:11,420
 "Okay, we might not get a final,"

859
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:14,060
 so they had to do it in like a qualifying match.

860
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:16,220
 It's one of those things that they don't do all the time now,

861
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:18,180
 because in theory, if you knew it was coming,

862
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:19,260
 you could kind of counter it,

863
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:21,620
 'cause you could only have two defenders in the circle,

864
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:23,820
 so they had to use all of their resources,

865
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:25,340
 but if you didn't see it coming,

866
00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:26,740
 you were like, "Ah, just a shot,"

867
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:29,020
 and then suddenly she's in the sky.

868
00:28:29,020 --> 00:28:30,340
 - So it's like a rugby throw-in, basically.

869
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:32,340
 - Yeah, like a line-out. - The way that, yeah,

870
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:33,300
 they lifted into the air.

871
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:35,420
 - You're not allowed to do that in football, by the way.

872
00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:37,020
 - Yeah, wow. - It's in the rules,

873
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:38,300
 officially in the rules.

874
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:39,700
 - Isn't it? - Yeah.

875
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:41,420
 - Piggybacks. - If you--

876
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:42,860
 - Fogging like a true athlete.

877
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:44,660
 (all laughing)

878
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:47,060
 - It's in the air, and you wanna head the ball in,

879
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:49,820
 and you think, "Well, I'm gonna give my mate a piggyback."

880
00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:52,580
 It's not allowed, it's un-gentlemanly conduct,

881
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:54,580
 it's called, it's an indirect free kick to the other team,

882
00:28:54,580 --> 00:28:56,660
 and both players should be cautioned.

883
00:28:56,660 --> 00:28:57,500
 - Get out. - Get out.

884
00:28:57,500 --> 00:28:58,340
 - Wow. - That's unfair.

885
00:28:58,340 --> 00:28:59,180
 I think you've got the weather ball

886
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:01,460
 to put together a piggyback in that time,

887
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:02,300
 and you should be allowed to do it.

888
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:06,420
 - That was in my, 'cause I trained as a football referee,

889
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:08,300
 and that was one of the questions that came up,

890
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:10,020
 it's like, "What do you do in this situation?"

891
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:12,740
 - Wow. - You give him a stern finger.

892
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:14,980
 (all laughing)

893
00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:17,340
 - I really wanna watch Andy's version of football, though.

894
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:18,180
 (all laughing)

895
00:29:18,180 --> 00:29:20,260
 It's a corner kick, he's gone for the piggyback,

896
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:24,060
 it's gone in, oh no, someone sawed through the back of that,

897
00:29:24,060 --> 00:29:26,820
 and it has gone right through, no points.

898
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:29,400
 (upbeat music)

899
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:34,940
 - Okay, it is time for fact number three, and that is Andy.

900
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:36,580
 My fact is that when the asteroid

901
00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:38,540
 which wiped out the dinosaurs hit,

902
00:29:38,540 --> 00:29:40,860
 there was a brief burst of radiation so strong

903
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:44,740
 it would have immediately cooked some dinosaurs through.

904
00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:46,840
 - Whoa, like an air fryer.

905
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:49,780
 - Yes, exactly, like an air fryer.

906
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:52,140
 - This is, it's much less fun

907
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:53,620
 than I've made it sound for the dinosaurs,

908
00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:55,060
 but what a, you know, for a brief--

909
00:29:55,060 --> 00:29:57,580
 - For like, the mammals survived, did they?

910
00:29:57,580 --> 00:30:00,900
 So could they have come out and eaten some dinosaur cooked?

911
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:03,100
 - Yes, yes, they probably could, yeah.

912
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:04,500
 - But you say for a brief moment,

913
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:07,620
 so it was perfectly cooked and then they were charred

914
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:09,940
 beyond oblivion, is that it?

915
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:13,100
 'Cause you could say, oh here is my roast for a brief moment.

916
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:18,100
 It was amazing, but it is a pile of ash now.

917
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:21,620
 - Yeah, no, you're right, you're absolutely right.

918
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:23,940
 I think a lot of, there weren't precise settings on.

919
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:26,740
 This is from a fantastic book I've just read.

920
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:29,060
 It's called Not the End of the World by Hannah Ritchie,

921
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:31,380
 and it's about completely different stuff actually,

922
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:35,020
 it's about sustainability and the big planetary challenges,

923
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:38,420
 but she's writing in this bit about, you know,

924
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:40,100
 extinction events and how fascinating

925
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:41,420
 some of those have been over the past,

926
00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:42,900
 and this is about the dinosaurs,

927
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:44,820
 65 million years ago, '66?

928
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:45,660
 - '66.

929
00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:47,940
 - A while ago, and the asteroid hits.

930
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:49,500
 - It was an old book that you read, wasn't it?

931
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:50,840
 - Yeah, that's right.

932
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:53,860
 (all laughing)

933
00:30:53,860 --> 00:30:55,940
 - Thing hits, there's a shockwave

934
00:30:55,940 --> 00:30:58,460
 that moves 17,000 miles an hour.

935
00:30:58,460 --> 00:31:00,620
 It's quite hard to get your head around some of this stuff.

936
00:31:00,620 --> 00:31:03,900
 And then this huge amount, like cubic miles of rock

937
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:05,500
 get lifted up by the impact.

938
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:08,340
 They then, so they've been liquidized

939
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:09,980
 into these little glass balls,

940
00:31:09,980 --> 00:31:12,460
 which go all the way around the planet immediately,

941
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:13,580
 and then that falls.

942
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:15,540
 - It literally, the kind of sky falls down, you know.

943
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:16,660
 - Yeah, rain's glass.

944
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:18,340
 - Yeah, liquid rock, basically.

945
00:31:18,340 --> 00:31:20,860
 And lots of it gets blasted by friction in the atmosphere

946
00:31:20,860 --> 00:31:22,860
 'cause it's coming back into the atmosphere, if you see.

947
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:23,700
 - Right.

948
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:27,260
 - So then the energy is released as infrared radiation,

949
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:30,260
 which turns into this massive blast of heat.

950
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:31,100
 - Thank you.

951
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:32,700
 - And if you were a dinosaur out in the open,

952
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:35,300
 it's bad news, and it's really interesting

953
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:38,380
 'cause why didn't everything burn immediately at that point?

954
00:31:38,380 --> 00:31:40,740
 And basically, there was a study in 2016

955
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:42,100
 by a scientist called Sean Gulick,

956
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:44,500
 who found out that either it was like being in a toaster

957
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:47,340
 for a few hours, or a pizza oven for a few minutes.

958
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:49,500
 It's bad news if you were out in the open.

959
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:50,340
 - Okay, wow.

960
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:51,780
 - So would there be some dinosaurs

961
00:31:51,780 --> 00:31:54,620
 who were the furthest away that would be nicely cooked?

962
00:31:54,620 --> 00:31:55,460
 - Yeah.

963
00:31:55,460 --> 00:31:56,300
 (all laughing)

964
00:31:56,300 --> 00:31:58,660
 - Medium round. - Just medium round, yes.

965
00:31:58,660 --> 00:32:00,540
 - So they get cooked by the radiation,

966
00:32:00,540 --> 00:32:02,980
 the innards are just completely just, they're cooked,

967
00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:04,700
 but so they die immediately,

968
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:06,660
 or is it kind of like radiation where--

969
00:32:06,660 --> 00:32:07,620
 - If you were out in the open,

970
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:09,300
 there's a very good chance you would have died at that point

971
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:11,020
 'cause it's such a blast of searing heat

972
00:32:11,020 --> 00:32:13,300
 for such a, for a relatively long time.

973
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:14,740
 Longer than you'd be comfortable with.

974
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:15,900
 - It's not just like a sauna.

975
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:16,740
 - No, it's just--

976
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:18,820
 (all laughing)

977
00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:20,060
 - For a brief moment in time,

978
00:32:20,060 --> 00:32:21,540
 the muscles were very relaxed.

979
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:24,060
 (all laughing)

980
00:32:24,060 --> 00:32:26,020
 - It is nuts reading about it.

981
00:32:26,020 --> 00:32:26,860
 - Yeah.

982
00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:27,700
 - I mean, it was pretty striking.

983
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:28,860
 - It was a big old rock, wasn't it?

984
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:29,700
 - A big old rock.

985
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:33,340
 I found one weird thing, this slide.

986
00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:34,740
 Right, so I think we've said before,

987
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:37,140
 it was the size of Mount Everest, the rock there.

988
00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:39,220
 And it was traveling 20 times the speed of a bullet.

989
00:32:39,220 --> 00:32:41,780
 It was really, really huge.

990
00:32:41,780 --> 00:32:42,620
 - Big and fast.

991
00:32:42,620 --> 00:32:43,780
 - Big and fast.

992
00:32:43,780 --> 00:32:47,540
 And it was so big and fast that when it arrived,

993
00:32:47,540 --> 00:32:50,240
 it was pushing the atmosphere in front of it so rapidly

994
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:52,960
 that the crater from the impact started to form

995
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:53,940
 before it hit.

996
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:54,780
 - Oh yeah.

997
00:32:54,780 --> 00:32:57,460
 - It just pushed the surface of the earth down.

998
00:32:57,460 --> 00:32:59,620
 - Oh my God, it's amazing, that, isn't it?

999
00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:01,020
 - Yeah, it's insane.

1000
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:04,420
 I became friends recently with the dinosaur hunter,

1001
00:33:04,420 --> 00:33:06,220
 who, well, she's a paleontologist,

1002
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:08,380
 who's the person who has verified

1003
00:33:08,380 --> 00:33:11,260
 that the asteroid landed in spring.

1004
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:13,620
 I think you guys met her very briefly in Belgium.

1005
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:14,440
 - Oh yeah.

1006
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:16,580
 - When we were at Nerdland, at the festival.

1007
00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:18,460
 It was all to do with the specific fish

1008
00:33:18,460 --> 00:33:20,820
 that as it was being carried in the tsunamis,

1009
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:22,460
 which was not just water, it was also earth,

1010
00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:24,340
 like an earth tsunami.

1011
00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:28,020
 The glass that had come down went into,

1012
00:33:28,020 --> 00:33:29,340
 through the filters of the fish,

1013
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:30,860
 like went through the mouth and were inside.

1014
00:33:30,860 --> 00:33:33,260
 So when they found the fossilized versions of these fish,

1015
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:34,140
 they found the glass.

1016
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:36,380
 And these specific fish are the type of fish

1017
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:39,380
 that have growths in their body that change per season.

1018
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:40,720
 - Oh, that's so handy.

1019
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:42,860
 - So during spring, yeah.

1020
00:33:42,860 --> 00:33:45,980
 So during spring, they grow these extra little things.

1021
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:47,260
 So they spotted that and they went,

1022
00:33:47,260 --> 00:33:48,740
 well, that could only happen in spring.

1023
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:51,420
 Therefore, in spring on the side of the planet that it's on,

1024
00:33:51,420 --> 00:33:52,260
 that's where that happened.

1025
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:53,100
 - That is amazing.

1026
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:53,940
 - Really nuts.

1027
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:54,780
 - It is nuts.

1028
00:33:54,780 --> 00:33:55,620
 - That's hot.

1029
00:33:55,620 --> 00:33:56,460
 You know, you're gonna deal with an asteroid

1030
00:33:56,460 --> 00:33:58,160
 and hay fever at the same time.

1031
00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:00,580
 (all laughing)

1032
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:04,620
 I was looking at extinct meat,

1033
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:08,100
 'cause a cultivated meat company in Australia

1034
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:10,580
 made a mammoth meatball last year.

1035
00:34:10,580 --> 00:34:12,660
 - Oh, yes, I heard about this, yeah.

1036
00:34:12,660 --> 00:34:17,020
 - Using a DNA sequence from the mammoth myoglobin,

1037
00:34:17,020 --> 00:34:19,660
 which is the protein that gives the meat its flavor,

1038
00:34:19,660 --> 00:34:22,740
 and filled in a few gaps using elephant DNA,

1039
00:34:22,740 --> 00:34:24,220
 and then they made this meatball.

1040
00:34:24,220 --> 00:34:25,780
 They did not eat the meatball.

1041
00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:26,620
 - Really?

1042
00:34:26,620 --> 00:34:28,500
 - They just put it on display to be like,

1043
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:29,420
 this is a mammoth meatball.

1044
00:34:29,420 --> 00:34:31,020
 I don't know, I think they were just,

1045
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:32,740
 they were like, we haven't really tested this,

1046
00:34:32,740 --> 00:34:35,180
 whether this is safe for human consumption.

1047
00:34:35,180 --> 00:34:36,020
 - Oh, really?

1048
00:34:36,020 --> 00:34:37,100
 - So we'll just make the meatball,

1049
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:38,900
 I guess, probably to get a bit of press.

1050
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:40,860
 - Is it the size of a normal meatball?

1051
00:34:40,860 --> 00:34:42,540
 'Cause you think if it was a mammoth meatball,

1052
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:44,060
 you would deliberately make it much bigger,

1053
00:34:44,060 --> 00:34:44,900
 wouldn't you?

1054
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:45,740
 - Yeah, exactly.

1055
00:34:45,740 --> 00:34:48,340
 - I didn't get, it wasn't next to like a can of Coke,

1056
00:34:48,340 --> 00:34:49,180
 so I'm not sure.

1057
00:34:49,180 --> 00:34:50,460
 (laughing)

1058
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:52,780
 - But it loves regular meatball science.

1059
00:34:52,780 --> 00:34:55,260
 - Maybe you wouldn't, 'cause then it would just confuse

1060
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:57,180
 the purchaser or the person looking at it,

1061
00:34:57,180 --> 00:34:58,660
 go, oh, I get it, it's mammoth, it's big.

1062
00:34:58,660 --> 00:35:00,340
 It's like, we're just not even considering

1063
00:35:00,340 --> 00:35:03,740
 the extraordinary science that has got into this.

1064
00:35:03,740 --> 00:35:05,060
 - I would have eaten that.

1065
00:35:05,060 --> 00:35:05,900
 - You wouldn't?

1066
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:08,620
 - Without knowing the health implications.

1067
00:35:08,620 --> 00:35:10,460
 - It's interesting.

1068
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:13,620
 - Okay, but I feel like they've grown it.

1069
00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:15,100
 No animals have been harmed.

1070
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:15,940
 - Yeah.

1071
00:35:15,940 --> 00:35:17,780
 - So I'm a veggie, but I would love to.

1072
00:35:17,780 --> 00:35:19,740
 - Yes, I think the same thing,

1073
00:35:19,740 --> 00:35:21,980
 'cause my boyfriend's vegetarian and he says

1074
00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:24,380
 that if we reached the point where we could just have

1075
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:26,820
 cultivated meat made from the actual cells,

1076
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:28,260
 then he'd go, oh, it's fine, I'll eat that.

1077
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:33,260
 And I think it's come a long way in the last few years.

1078
00:35:33,260 --> 00:35:36,380
 I think the first patty they made,

1079
00:35:36,380 --> 00:35:38,740
 like a mince patty, a salad just with mince patties,

1080
00:35:38,740 --> 00:35:43,100
 was I think $300,000, so quite an expensive burger.

1081
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:44,700
 But it's come down now where they think

1082
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:46,340
 that they could, you know, release these things.

1083
00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:47,180
 - To like 200,000.

1084
00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:48,020
 - Yeah.

1085
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:51,300
 - Release them into supermarkets, so it's rapidly.

1086
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:52,780
 - I experimented quite a lot with those.

1087
00:35:52,780 --> 00:35:53,860
 I tried some salmon the other day,

1088
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:55,940
 which I have to say was not there.

1089
00:35:55,940 --> 00:35:57,580
 - Oh yeah, it's like the fake salmon.

1090
00:35:57,580 --> 00:35:58,420
 - I'm saying it's not to do.

1091
00:35:58,420 --> 00:36:00,100
 - It's not the like made from actual.

1092
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:01,620
 - I'm sorry, yeah, that's fine.

1093
00:36:01,620 --> 00:36:03,140
 - I think they just keep adding salt

1094
00:36:03,140 --> 00:36:06,580
 until it has some kind of flavor that explains.

1095
00:36:06,580 --> 00:36:09,380
 - I had a vegan Domino's pepperoni pizza

1096
00:36:09,380 --> 00:36:11,860
 a couple of nights ago, that's not an ad.

1097
00:36:11,860 --> 00:36:13,900
 And I could not taste the difference.

1098
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:14,740
 - Really?

1099
00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:15,580
 - Genuinely could not taste the difference.

1100
00:36:15,580 --> 00:36:16,660
 - I will just say for the listeners at home,

1101
00:36:16,660 --> 00:36:18,820
 he does have a Domino's tetu or something.

1102
00:36:18,820 --> 00:36:19,660
 (all laughing)

1103
00:36:19,660 --> 00:36:20,500
 - He's trying to show off.

1104
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:21,660
 - He's wearing two watches,

1105
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:23,780
 one of which seems to be a Domino's pizza.

1106
00:36:23,780 --> 00:36:24,620
 - Yeah, what's that?

1107
00:36:24,620 --> 00:36:25,540
 Oh, pizza time.

1108
00:36:25,540 --> 00:36:27,500
 (all laughing)

1109
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:29,620
 - Can I ask, did it have cheese on it?

1110
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:30,940
 - It did, well, no, but it had vegan cheese.

1111
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:31,780
 - It has vegan cheese on it.

1112
00:36:31,780 --> 00:36:32,620
 - Yeah, yeah.

1113
00:36:32,620 --> 00:36:33,980
 - It's a vegan pizza, yeah.

1114
00:36:33,980 --> 00:36:35,860
 - They used to have a vegan pizzerics,

1115
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:37,740
 but seeing as we're talking about pizzas now,

1116
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:39,100
 they used to have a vegan pizzerics best

1117
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:39,940
 down the road from here,

1118
00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:42,100
 which only sold vegan pizzas.

1119
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:44,900
 And it was the most disgusting thing though.

1120
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:47,660
 - The cheese, like they just couldn't do good vegan cheese.

1121
00:36:47,660 --> 00:36:48,500
 Maybe they can now.

1122
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:50,540
 - It's all about the mouthfeel.

1123
00:36:50,540 --> 00:36:52,420
 - That's the, and the stretch.

1124
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:53,740
 - That's your tinder bio.

1125
00:36:53,740 --> 00:36:56,060
 (all laughing)

1126
00:36:56,060 --> 00:36:57,740
 - The mouthfeeling, the stretch.

1127
00:36:57,740 --> 00:36:59,940
 (all laughing)

1128
00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:02,060
 - I found an essay in a scientific journal

1129
00:37:02,060 --> 00:37:04,020
 called Evolution, Education and Outreach,

1130
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:07,620
 and it asked, which items a Jewish time traveler

1131
00:37:07,620 --> 00:37:09,980
 would be able to eat because they were kosher or not?

1132
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:10,820
 - Yeah, okay.

1133
00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:12,860
 - Can you guess the headline of this article?

1134
00:37:12,860 --> 00:37:15,540
 - 50 points to anyone who does, is gettable.

1135
00:37:15,540 --> 00:37:17,020
 - Oh, is it a pun?

1136
00:37:17,020 --> 00:37:18,220
 Back to the juicer.

1137
00:37:18,220 --> 00:37:20,060
 - The juicer, that's not that.

1138
00:37:20,060 --> 00:37:20,900
 So it's about the food.

1139
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:23,380
 It's about the food that you might be eating.

1140
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:26,100
 - Is it to do with time travel?

1141
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:27,940
 - It's to do with a very famous

1142
00:37:27,940 --> 00:37:29,580
 dinosaur-based franchise.

1143
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:30,620
 (all laughing)

1144
00:37:30,620 --> 00:37:31,460
 - Jurassic pork.

1145
00:37:31,460 --> 00:37:32,300
 - Jurassic pork.

1146
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:33,620
 (all exclaiming)

1147
00:37:33,620 --> 00:37:34,460
 - Beautiful.

1148
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:35,300
 - Jurassic pork.

1149
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:36,140
 - Beautiful.

1150
00:37:36,140 --> 00:37:38,260
 - And it was, that's a good headline.

1151
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:39,100
 - Yeah, that's good.

1152
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:42,220
 - And it was about what basically a Jewish time traveler

1153
00:37:42,220 --> 00:37:43,860
 who wanted to eat contemporaneous food

1154
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:44,700
 would be allowed to eat.

1155
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:46,980
 And basically very few dinosaurs are kosher,

1156
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:47,820
 it turns out.

1157
00:37:47,820 --> 00:37:48,660
 - Oh, wow.

1158
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:49,940
 - Some of them are birds.

1159
00:37:49,940 --> 00:37:52,980
 But even the bird ones lack the sort of toe

1160
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:54,260
 that you have to, if you're allowed to eat

1161
00:37:54,260 --> 00:37:55,500
 particular meats that are kosher,

1162
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:57,180
 it's 'cause they're like chicken.

1163
00:37:57,180 --> 00:37:59,460
 They've got a particular opposable toe, I think.

1164
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:00,600
 - Right.

1165
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:01,780
 - Mice are not allowed.

1166
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:03,140
 That's probably not relevant now.

1167
00:38:03,140 --> 00:38:05,620
 - So sorry, Jew-rasic pork.

1168
00:38:05,620 --> 00:38:06,980
 - They actually just went with Jurassic.

1169
00:38:06,980 --> 00:38:08,300
 - They just went with Jurassic?

1170
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:09,140
 - Yeah.

1171
00:38:09,140 --> 00:38:10,620
 - What, Jew-rasic pork?

1172
00:38:10,620 --> 00:38:12,460
 - I think they were correct in that.

1173
00:38:12,460 --> 00:38:15,740
 I think Jurassic pork is...

1174
00:38:15,740 --> 00:38:17,540
 - It's sitting there.

1175
00:38:17,540 --> 00:38:18,380
 - Yeah, I guess so.

1176
00:38:18,380 --> 00:38:19,540
 - It's like a complaints letter.

1177
00:38:19,540 --> 00:38:21,660
 (laughing)

1178
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:24,940
 - We said earlier, 65, 66 million years ago

1179
00:38:24,940 --> 00:38:26,420
 with the extinction of the dinosaurs.

1180
00:38:26,420 --> 00:38:27,820
 - Sure.

1181
00:38:27,820 --> 00:38:31,820
 - But do you know how long ago that is in a galactic year?

1182
00:38:31,820 --> 00:38:32,740
 - Ooh.

1183
00:38:32,740 --> 00:38:34,340
 - I'd never heard of a galactic year before.

1184
00:38:34,340 --> 00:38:37,060
 - There must be something to do with the traveling

1185
00:38:37,060 --> 00:38:37,900
 through the galaxy.

1186
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:40,220
 - Yeah, so how long it takes the galaxy to go on once?

1187
00:38:40,220 --> 00:38:41,060
 - Exactly.

1188
00:38:41,060 --> 00:38:42,740
 - I think it's three years ago in galaxy years.

1189
00:38:42,740 --> 00:38:46,740
 - Galactic year is 225 million years, roughly.

1190
00:38:46,740 --> 00:38:47,580
 - Sort of 10.

1191
00:38:47,580 --> 00:38:48,420
 - Yeah.

1192
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:49,260
 - Incorrect.

1193
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:50,100
 - Really?

1194
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:52,540
 - So the dinosaurs were here 3.5 months ago.

1195
00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:53,380
 - Oh wow.

1196
00:38:53,380 --> 00:38:54,220
 - In a galactic year.

1197
00:38:54,220 --> 00:38:56,180
 - The dinosaurs were on Earth,

1198
00:38:56,180 --> 00:38:58,060
 but if you had a time machine,

1199
00:38:58,060 --> 00:39:00,300
 like, you know what does Doctor Who have?

1200
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:02,620
 It's like a TARDIS, yeah.

1201
00:39:02,620 --> 00:39:04,020
 You go into the TARDIS

1202
00:39:04,020 --> 00:39:07,460
 and you come back exactly in the same position in space,

1203
00:39:07,460 --> 00:39:10,420
 but different time, the Earth won't be here anymore.

1204
00:39:10,420 --> 00:39:11,700
 - Yeah, we'll be further in space.

1205
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:12,540
 - Yeah.

1206
00:39:12,540 --> 00:39:13,380
 - Yeah, so you have to-

1207
00:39:13,380 --> 00:39:15,580
 - And if Doctor Who was going through-

1208
00:39:15,580 --> 00:39:17,820
 (laughing)

1209
00:39:17,820 --> 00:39:19,300
 - Sorry, I was just trying to appeal.

1210
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:21,580
 (laughing)

1211
00:39:21,580 --> 00:39:22,740
 - Oh my goodness.

1212
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:23,580
 - Yeah.

1213
00:39:23,580 --> 00:39:26,160
 (upbeat music)

1214
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:31,140
 - Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show.

1215
00:39:31,140 --> 00:39:32,420
 And that is my fact.

1216
00:39:32,420 --> 00:39:34,860
 My fact this week is that in the 1980s,

1217
00:39:34,860 --> 00:39:38,060
 you could download video games over the radio.

1218
00:39:38,060 --> 00:39:38,900
 - Okay.

1219
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:39,740
 - What?

1220
00:39:39,740 --> 00:39:40,580
 - Yeah.

1221
00:39:40,580 --> 00:39:41,400
 - What?

1222
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:42,500
 - To a certain generation, that's gonna be like,

1223
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:44,660
 there used to be a thing called MySpace.

1224
00:39:44,660 --> 00:39:45,500
 - Yeah.

1225
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:46,340
 (laughing)

1226
00:39:46,340 --> 00:39:47,180
 - Have you heard of DVDs?

1227
00:39:47,180 --> 00:39:49,420
 - I was alive in the 1980s and I never heard that.

1228
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:51,580
 - Yeah, no, I didn't think of this either.

1229
00:39:51,580 --> 00:39:53,540
 This was the very early days of computers

1230
00:39:53,540 --> 00:39:56,340
 whereby hard drives were incredibly expensive.

1231
00:39:56,340 --> 00:39:58,580
 So they used to have an audio cassette,

1232
00:39:58,580 --> 00:39:59,780
 like you would in a stereo.

1233
00:39:59,780 --> 00:40:00,980
 You could put a cassette in

1234
00:40:00,980 --> 00:40:02,660
 and that's where you would keep all the data

1235
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:04,540
 of programs that you were loading up.

1236
00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:07,300
 So someone made the connection that actually,

1237
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:09,060
 if you're able to record onto a cassette,

1238
00:40:09,060 --> 00:40:10,700
 you should be able to transfer

1239
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:13,940
 multiple different kinds of data over the radio.

1240
00:40:13,940 --> 00:40:15,180
 And why not video games?

1241
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:17,580
 So what people used to do is they used to tune in

1242
00:40:17,580 --> 00:40:22,040
 to radio shows that basically just played data over the waves.

1243
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:24,700
 You'd put your cassette in and you would press record

1244
00:40:24,700 --> 00:40:26,100
 and then you take it out, put it in your computer

1245
00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:26,940
 and there's your video game.

1246
00:40:26,940 --> 00:40:28,460
 - So these were dedicated radio stations

1247
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:30,540
 and wasn't like, that was talking here.

1248
00:40:30,540 --> 00:40:32,140
 (laughing)

1249
00:40:32,140 --> 00:40:33,860
 - It was now time for Tetris.

1250
00:40:33,860 --> 00:40:38,300
 So what did the audio sound like?

1251
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:41,700
 - Well, for people probably older than you,

1252
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:43,540
 but younger than me, it would sound like,

1253
00:40:43,540 --> 00:40:46,020
 you know, when you had dial-up internet

1254
00:40:46,020 --> 00:40:49,180
 and a fax came through on a phone line,

1255
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:50,020
 it's just like...

1256
00:40:50,020 --> 00:40:53,660
 Yeah, it's exactly that.

1257
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:55,260
 - And the computer just takes that

1258
00:40:55,260 --> 00:40:57,300
 and if it's a high sound, it's a one

1259
00:40:57,300 --> 00:40:58,940
 and if it's a low sound, it's a zero

1260
00:40:58,940 --> 00:41:00,620
 and it just turns it into zeros and ones

1261
00:41:00,620 --> 00:41:01,460
 and makes games out of it.

1262
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:03,840
 - Yeah, and to be fair, that could be confused

1263
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:05,500
 as a very popular type of...

1264
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:06,340
 - Yes, exactly.

1265
00:41:06,340 --> 00:41:07,180
 - Techno.

1266
00:41:07,180 --> 00:41:09,380
 (laughing)

1267
00:41:09,380 --> 00:41:11,300
 Yeah, so this was done for ages

1268
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:14,140
 and then suddenly, obviously modern technology

1269
00:41:14,140 --> 00:41:15,940
 and prices, you know, the equivalent

1270
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:18,860
 of the Mammoth Berger coming down from 300,000,

1271
00:41:18,860 --> 00:41:21,260
 they suddenly were able to afford to have hard drives

1272
00:41:21,260 --> 00:41:23,560
 and computers and so it slowly got wiped out.

1273
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:25,900
 But yeah, that was the thing that happened.

1274
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:30,340
 It's bizarre to think that you could take a video game,

1275
00:41:30,340 --> 00:41:32,940
 Grand Theft Auto, by just listening to the radio

1276
00:41:32,940 --> 00:41:34,460
 and recording it.

1277
00:41:34,460 --> 00:41:36,620
 I'm not used to the idea that data could be transmitted

1278
00:41:36,620 --> 00:41:38,580
 in ways that we can hear and understand.

1279
00:41:38,580 --> 00:41:41,180
 - It's so strong, yes, yeah.

1280
00:41:41,180 --> 00:41:42,620
 - And obviously data could be transmitted

1281
00:41:42,620 --> 00:41:43,860
 in ways we can hear and understand

1282
00:41:43,860 --> 00:41:47,260
 'cause I'm talking to you all as I understand.

1283
00:41:47,260 --> 00:41:49,740
 But yeah, yeah, and there was weird things

1284
00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:53,060
 that were done using this kind of novelty, I guess it was,

1285
00:41:53,060 --> 00:41:54,940
 Radio West, do you ever hear of Radio West?

1286
00:41:54,940 --> 00:41:56,900
 I think it's BBC and they just called it Radio West.

1287
00:41:56,900 --> 00:41:58,900
 So it's sort of you get your local BBC in an area.

1288
00:41:58,900 --> 00:42:01,660
 There used to be a host who was called,

1289
00:42:01,660 --> 00:42:04,300
 ooh, what was he called?

1290
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:06,100
 Sorry, hang on a sec.

1291
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:07,660
 There used to be a host called Joe Tozzer,

1292
00:42:07,660 --> 00:42:09,220
 who used to work for--

1293
00:42:09,220 --> 00:42:10,060
 (laughing)

1294
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:11,500
 - How did you forget that name?

1295
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:13,580
 (laughing)

1296
00:42:13,580 --> 00:42:14,740
 - And then at number six this week,

1297
00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:16,380
 Joe Tozzer and the master-paters.

1298
00:42:16,380 --> 00:42:18,640
 (laughing)

1299
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:21,740
 - So funny.

1300
00:42:21,740 --> 00:42:23,980
 (laughing)

1301
00:42:23,980 --> 00:42:27,700
 - Sorry, Joe, if you're listening.

1302
00:42:27,700 --> 00:42:29,500
 But also, how was school?

1303
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:31,260
 Was that, that was a rough one.

1304
00:42:31,260 --> 00:42:32,100
 - How do you spell it?

1305
00:42:32,100 --> 00:42:33,180
 - It could be Tozzer.

1306
00:42:33,180 --> 00:42:34,020
 - Tozzer, yeah.

1307
00:42:34,020 --> 00:42:35,860
 - I'm sure he says Tozzer.

1308
00:42:35,860 --> 00:42:38,020
 - I was in "Fade Tozzer" from Steps.

1309
00:42:38,020 --> 00:42:38,860
 - Okay.

1310
00:42:38,860 --> 00:42:39,700
 - We're a piece of good together,

1311
00:42:39,700 --> 00:42:40,700
 it was definitely a different name for that.

1312
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:41,540
 - Tozzer.

1313
00:42:41,540 --> 00:42:42,380
 - Yeah, he are.

1314
00:42:42,380 --> 00:42:43,220
 - Oh yeah, Tozzer.

1315
00:42:43,220 --> 00:42:44,540
 - You said he went with Tozzer.

1316
00:42:44,540 --> 00:42:46,780
 (laughing)

1317
00:42:46,780 --> 00:42:49,700
 - Sorry, Joe.

1318
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:54,180
 - But yeah, so he once broadcast the data sounds

1319
00:42:54,180 --> 00:42:56,100
 of what ended up being a pixel image

1320
00:42:56,100 --> 00:42:58,220
 of one of Charlie's Angels Angels.

1321
00:42:58,220 --> 00:42:59,980
 So the star Sheryl Land.

1322
00:42:59,980 --> 00:43:01,820
 So you recorded it down, put it into your computer

1323
00:43:01,820 --> 00:43:04,460
 and slowly it pixelated together,

1324
00:43:04,460 --> 00:43:07,340
 40 by 80 pixels of the star.

1325
00:43:07,340 --> 00:43:08,180
 - 40 by 80.

1326
00:43:08,180 --> 00:43:09,020
 - 40 by 80.

1327
00:43:09,020 --> 00:43:10,900
 - It's actually resolution, it is.

1328
00:43:10,900 --> 00:43:11,980
 - Is that a boob or a head?

1329
00:43:11,980 --> 00:43:14,240
 (laughing)

1330
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:20,620
 - And of course you could do it with vinyl as well.

1331
00:43:20,620 --> 00:43:23,660
 And there was some computer game magazines

1332
00:43:23,660 --> 00:43:24,980
 that would put little vinyls

1333
00:43:24,980 --> 00:43:26,700
 on front of the magazine.

1334
00:43:26,700 --> 00:43:29,140
 And it would just play this noise

1335
00:43:29,140 --> 00:43:32,940
 which your computer then would recognize as zeros and ones

1336
00:43:32,940 --> 00:43:35,100
 and would turn into a game.

1337
00:43:35,100 --> 00:43:36,420
 It's all 'cause you didn't have enough memory

1338
00:43:36,420 --> 00:43:37,260
 on your computer.

1339
00:43:37,260 --> 00:43:38,340
 - It's exactly that, yeah.

1340
00:43:38,340 --> 00:43:40,380
 - So your memory had to be on your cassette.

1341
00:43:40,380 --> 00:43:41,220
 - Yeah.

1342
00:43:41,220 --> 00:43:42,660
 - What are the limitations of it now?

1343
00:43:42,660 --> 00:43:47,660
 So in theory, could we do it for a more complex game

1344
00:43:47,660 --> 00:43:49,500
 than Tetris or Pong or--

1345
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:51,020
 - You could for sure, I reckon.

1346
00:43:51,020 --> 00:43:51,980
 But the problem is,

1347
00:43:51,980 --> 00:43:53,380
 'cause I used to have one of these computers

1348
00:43:53,380 --> 00:43:54,540
 with the cassettes on,

1349
00:43:54,540 --> 00:43:56,180
 it would take about 30 minutes

1350
00:43:56,180 --> 00:43:58,260
 to load any game onto your computer.

1351
00:43:58,260 --> 00:44:01,220
 And they were all really shit games.

1352
00:44:01,220 --> 00:44:04,700
 They were fun, but the graphics were terrible and whatever.

1353
00:44:04,700 --> 00:44:07,340
 And often you would get to the end of the 30 minutes

1354
00:44:07,340 --> 00:44:10,220
 and one of its zeros or ones would have been read wrong

1355
00:44:10,220 --> 00:44:11,940
 and the whole thing would be knackered.

1356
00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:13,580
 You'd have to start again.

1357
00:44:13,580 --> 00:44:16,580
 And so if you wanted to put like Grand Theft Auto

1358
00:44:16,580 --> 00:44:19,060
 on today, you'd probably have to make it play

1359
00:44:19,060 --> 00:44:20,300
 for about 40 years.

1360
00:44:20,300 --> 00:44:21,640
 - Yeah, okay, all right.

1361
00:44:21,640 --> 00:44:22,480
 - That would be great to know

1362
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:23,460
 'cause the game is so massive.

1363
00:44:23,460 --> 00:44:24,740
 You're a gamer, aren't you?

1364
00:44:24,740 --> 00:44:27,020
 - I'm a little bit of a gamer, yes.

1365
00:44:27,020 --> 00:44:31,220
 Can we get Baldur's Gate 3 in audio form?

1366
00:44:31,220 --> 00:44:34,660
 - They did end up releasing very specific audio blank cassettes

1367
00:44:34,660 --> 00:44:36,980
 that you could get called basic code.

1368
00:44:36,980 --> 00:44:40,980
 So it would guarantee compatibility with your computer

1369
00:44:40,980 --> 00:44:43,140
 as opposed to I imagine there were a few audio cassettes

1370
00:44:43,140 --> 00:44:45,100
 out there that didn't quite do it.

1371
00:44:45,100 --> 00:44:47,420
 And so, yeah, you would tune into either like DataRama

1372
00:44:47,420 --> 00:44:50,220
 or HobbyScoop, which were specific radio stations

1373
00:44:50,220 --> 00:44:51,060
 that-- - That's amazing.

1374
00:44:51,060 --> 00:44:54,140
 - But you can just put on Radio 4

1375
00:44:54,140 --> 00:44:55,540
 and listen to the shipping forecast

1376
00:44:55,540 --> 00:44:56,900
 and make that into your own game.

1377
00:44:56,900 --> 00:44:58,220
 I find, you know.

1378
00:44:58,220 --> 00:45:01,100
 - We used to do this as kids, actually.

1379
00:45:01,100 --> 00:45:04,060
 And we would have to guess whether it was rising slowly

1380
00:45:04,060 --> 00:45:05,980
 or, you know, I don't know if it's the pressure

1381
00:45:05,980 --> 00:45:10,420
 or something, they go, "Dogger 75, rising slowly."

1382
00:45:10,420 --> 00:45:11,940
 We had to guess what it was gonna be.

1383
00:45:11,940 --> 00:45:12,780
 - That's good.

1384
00:45:12,780 --> 00:45:14,900
 Who's the host of the shipping forecast?

1385
00:45:14,900 --> 00:45:16,260
 - I don't think it's got a host per se.

1386
00:45:16,260 --> 00:45:17,940
 - Well, the person who reads--

1387
00:45:17,940 --> 00:45:18,780
 - I don't know.

1388
00:45:18,780 --> 00:45:19,620
 - I can't remember.

1389
00:45:19,620 --> 00:45:20,940
 I think it's been the same person for about 40 years.

1390
00:45:20,940 --> 00:45:21,780
 - She's very famous.

1391
00:45:21,780 --> 00:45:23,940
 Yeah, she's married, I think, to Claire Bolding.

1392
00:45:23,940 --> 00:45:26,500
 She, I was on a show with her once

1393
00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:29,980
 and I was asked, "Do you wanna have any questions for her

1394
00:45:29,980 --> 00:45:31,860
 "about the shipping forecast?"

1395
00:45:31,860 --> 00:45:33,780
 I didn't know what to ask 'cause I'd never heard it.

1396
00:45:33,780 --> 00:45:36,180
 So I said, "What's your favorite ship?"

1397
00:45:36,180 --> 00:45:38,620
 (laughing)

1398
00:45:38,620 --> 00:45:40,340
 That's a good question.

1399
00:45:40,340 --> 00:45:41,420
 - It's a good question.

1400
00:45:41,420 --> 00:45:42,740
 Did she have an answer?

1401
00:45:42,740 --> 00:45:45,300
 - No, she was like, "You haven't heard my show, have you?"

1402
00:45:45,300 --> 00:45:47,620
 I said, "No, I haven't, food."

1403
00:45:47,620 --> 00:45:49,100
 - And she said, "What's your favorite fish?"

1404
00:45:49,100 --> 00:45:50,420
 - Yeah.

1405
00:45:50,420 --> 00:45:53,180
 - Did you hear of the game Great Britain Limited?

1406
00:45:53,180 --> 00:45:55,580
 I was looking at some early spectrum games.

1407
00:45:55,580 --> 00:45:56,900
 - No.

1408
00:45:56,900 --> 00:45:58,300
 - In Great Britain Limited,

1409
00:45:58,300 --> 00:46:00,780
 it was a government simulation

1410
00:46:00,780 --> 00:46:04,060
 where you managed the British economy and--

1411
00:46:04,060 --> 00:46:05,380
 - I love it.

1412
00:46:05,380 --> 00:46:06,220
 - Wow.

1413
00:46:06,220 --> 00:46:07,220
 - There's no way to win.

1414
00:46:07,220 --> 00:46:09,060
 - It was very--

1415
00:46:09,060 --> 00:46:10,060
 - Did they give Lys Trassa a go there?

1416
00:46:10,060 --> 00:46:12,540
 (laughing)

1417
00:46:12,540 --> 00:46:13,540
 - This was easy.

1418
00:46:13,540 --> 00:46:16,020
 (laughing)

1419
00:46:16,020 --> 00:46:18,060
 - Yeah, you would like change little things

1420
00:46:18,060 --> 00:46:19,540
 and then the inflation would go up

1421
00:46:19,540 --> 00:46:22,820
 or the unemployment would go down or vice versa.

1422
00:46:22,820 --> 00:46:24,820
 And then every five years you would have an election

1423
00:46:24,820 --> 00:46:26,660
 and depending on how well you've done,

1424
00:46:26,660 --> 00:46:28,940
 it would say you've been kicked out

1425
00:46:28,940 --> 00:46:30,340
 or you've got another five years.

1426
00:46:30,340 --> 00:46:32,300
 - Wow, that is so funny.

1427
00:46:32,300 --> 00:46:33,580
 That's really good.

1428
00:46:33,580 --> 00:46:34,420
 What was that?

1429
00:46:34,420 --> 00:46:36,140
 - '80s, yeah, early '80s.

1430
00:46:36,140 --> 00:46:37,500
 - Wow, and it was government-made?

1431
00:46:37,500 --> 00:46:38,660
 - No, it was just--

1432
00:46:38,660 --> 00:46:39,500
 - Oh, okay.

1433
00:46:39,500 --> 00:46:40,940
 - A lot of these games in the '80s,

1434
00:46:40,940 --> 00:46:43,660
 they were just made by kids in the bedrooms.

1435
00:46:43,660 --> 00:46:45,380
 - Yeah, which was mad.

1436
00:46:45,380 --> 00:46:48,820
 I went over to the home of a rider friend of my other friends

1437
00:46:48,820 --> 00:46:50,140
 and she was like, "I want you to meet him.

1438
00:46:50,140 --> 00:46:50,980
 "He's really cool."

1439
00:46:50,980 --> 00:46:53,180
 We went over and he just pulled out a whole archive

1440
00:46:53,180 --> 00:46:55,500
 of cassettes of games he invented.

1441
00:46:55,500 --> 00:46:56,340
 - Wow.

1442
00:46:56,340 --> 00:46:58,380
 - Yeah, and that was the first time I ever learned

1443
00:46:58,380 --> 00:47:00,300
 that games could be put on an audio cassette.

1444
00:47:00,300 --> 00:47:02,940
 - It was a good time for creativity,

1445
00:47:02,940 --> 00:47:04,700
 but just in a very shitty medium.

1446
00:47:04,700 --> 00:47:06,540
 (laughing)

1447
00:47:06,540 --> 00:47:08,100
 - Much like the podcast.

1448
00:47:08,100 --> 00:47:10,340
 (laughing)

1449
00:47:10,340 --> 00:47:13,500
 Do you have any really weird games, Mel?

1450
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:15,500
 - Do I have any weird games at one point?

1451
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:17,660
 'Cause I have quite an addictive personality

1452
00:47:17,660 --> 00:47:18,700
 when it comes to games.

1453
00:47:18,700 --> 00:47:22,500
 There is a very stupid game on Steam called Cookie Clicker.

1454
00:47:22,500 --> 00:47:25,460
 And it's literally a cookie and you just click it

1455
00:47:25,460 --> 00:47:26,860
 and you get another cookie.

1456
00:47:26,860 --> 00:47:30,020
 But then you keep clicking and then you can buy

1457
00:47:30,020 --> 00:47:33,460
 like a cafe that makes cookies.

1458
00:47:33,460 --> 00:47:35,260
 So you just, it's basic.

1459
00:47:35,260 --> 00:47:37,660
 I feel like it feeds the endorphins in your brain

1460
00:47:37,660 --> 00:47:39,180
 because you just like keep clicking

1461
00:47:39,180 --> 00:47:41,220
 and then you can buy like an automatic clicker

1462
00:47:41,220 --> 00:47:43,740
 with the cookies and then it will automatically

1463
00:47:43,740 --> 00:47:44,580
 click it for you.

1464
00:47:44,580 --> 00:47:47,180
 And then you can buy a factory of cookies.

1465
00:47:47,180 --> 00:47:48,580
 And you keep, and it's-

1466
00:47:48,580 --> 00:47:49,660
 - But you have to keep clicking.

1467
00:47:49,660 --> 00:47:52,100
 - But you could leave it for like an hour

1468
00:47:52,100 --> 00:47:54,460
 because you've run an automated system.

1469
00:47:54,460 --> 00:47:55,740
 And then you come back and you're like,

1470
00:47:55,740 --> 00:47:57,660
 I've got four billion cookies.

1471
00:47:57,660 --> 00:48:00,580
 And it just feeds the endorphins in your brain

1472
00:48:00,580 --> 00:48:01,740
 because you're like, I'm doing,

1473
00:48:01,740 --> 00:48:03,220
 I'm getting better at this game.

1474
00:48:03,220 --> 00:48:04,820
 - Do you say it's on Steam?

1475
00:48:04,820 --> 00:48:05,860
 - It's on Steam, a lot of that.

1476
00:48:05,860 --> 00:48:06,700
 - What is Steam?

1477
00:48:06,700 --> 00:48:07,540
 - Steam is just-

1478
00:48:07,540 --> 00:48:09,500
 - Oh, that's so embarrassing.

1479
00:48:09,500 --> 00:48:12,220
 But just for the other people who don't know what it is.

1480
00:48:12,220 --> 00:48:14,140
 - It's for those idiots listening at home.

1481
00:48:14,140 --> 00:48:18,100
 - No, just kidding. Steam is just a game library, essentially.

1482
00:48:18,100 --> 00:48:20,860
 So it's, if you're on a PC, you can download games

1483
00:48:20,860 --> 00:48:23,740
 and almost all games, unless they're like console exclusive

1484
00:48:23,740 --> 00:48:25,820
 will be on Steam that you can download.

1485
00:48:25,820 --> 00:48:26,660
 - And a console?

1486
00:48:26,660 --> 00:48:28,460
 (laughing)

1487
00:48:28,460 --> 00:48:31,060
 - Are you taking you guys out gamers?

1488
00:48:31,060 --> 00:48:32,140
 - I've actually lost Steam.

1489
00:48:32,140 --> 00:48:33,060
 - You have got Steam.

1490
00:48:33,060 --> 00:48:33,900
 - Do you?

1491
00:48:33,900 --> 00:48:34,740
 - What games do you play?

1492
00:48:34,740 --> 00:48:36,140
 - Don't play many games on it.

1493
00:48:36,140 --> 00:48:36,980
 - No, really?

1494
00:48:36,980 --> 00:48:37,820
 - I play Fortnite, all right?

1495
00:48:37,820 --> 00:48:38,740
 I play Fortnite against eight year olds

1496
00:48:38,740 --> 00:48:40,940
 around the world, I'm a lose.

1497
00:48:40,940 --> 00:48:43,740
 - I tried Fortnite and I was just too embarrassed

1498
00:48:43,740 --> 00:48:46,620
 to continue, 'cause the skill cap of that game is so high

1499
00:48:46,620 --> 00:48:48,500
 and these 14 year olds that have been playing

1500
00:48:48,500 --> 00:48:51,420
 since they were nine are just so good

1501
00:48:51,420 --> 00:48:53,900
 that you couldn't possibly just start a game now

1502
00:48:53,900 --> 00:48:56,020
 and be anywhere near as good as them.

1503
00:48:56,020 --> 00:48:58,300
 So it's just, you know?

1504
00:48:58,300 --> 00:49:01,020
 - If I put myself in the mind of a 14 year old

1505
00:49:01,020 --> 00:49:03,380
 playing this game, would it be immediately obvious

1506
00:49:03,380 --> 00:49:04,500
 which one Andy was?

1507
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:06,140
 - Oh yeah, yeah, I think so.

1508
00:49:06,140 --> 00:49:07,660
 - I'm the guy hiding in one of the buildings,

1509
00:49:07,660 --> 00:49:09,420
 just trying to have a nice afternoon.

1510
00:49:09,420 --> 00:49:12,380
 There's a cookie, I'm trying to click on that.

1511
00:49:12,380 --> 00:49:13,220
 - Yeah.

1512
00:49:13,220 --> 00:49:15,960
 - He's soaring out the bed from a minute.

1513
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:18,260
 (laughing)

1514
00:49:18,260 --> 00:49:19,820
 - Trying to escape.

1515
00:49:19,820 --> 00:49:23,140
 - Here's a fact about the guy who invented

1516
00:49:23,140 --> 00:49:25,980
 video games, arguably, and it's sent in by,

1517
00:49:25,980 --> 00:49:28,100
 listen to this, it's sent in by Grant Wyn Jones,

1518
00:49:28,100 --> 00:49:30,140
 who's sent in the fact that nuclear bombs

1519
00:49:30,140 --> 00:49:32,380
 and video games were created by the same guy.

1520
00:49:32,380 --> 00:49:35,380
 - Yeah, that's actually a deleted scene from

1521
00:49:35,380 --> 00:49:36,220
 Oppenheimer. - Oppenheimer.

1522
00:49:36,220 --> 00:49:38,020
 (laughing)

1523
00:49:38,020 --> 00:49:39,300
 - Well, it's not Oppenheimer,

1524
00:49:39,300 --> 00:49:41,420
 but it's a guy called William Higginbotham,

1525
00:49:41,420 --> 00:49:45,940
 great name, who did invent the first screen-based

1526
00:49:45,940 --> 00:49:48,580
 video game, it was called Tennis for Two,

1527
00:49:48,580 --> 00:49:50,260
 and it was in 1958.

1528
00:49:50,260 --> 00:49:51,500
 - Sounds like Pong, right?

1529
00:49:51,500 --> 00:49:55,820
 - It's pretty Pong-y, it's like 2D tennis.

1530
00:49:55,820 --> 00:49:57,500
 There was nothing to play it on,

1531
00:49:57,500 --> 00:49:59,860
 so you had to play it on an oscilloscope,

1532
00:49:59,860 --> 00:50:01,980
 which is a device to measure voltage waves,

1533
00:50:01,980 --> 00:50:04,260
 and that, because there were no consoles,

1534
00:50:04,260 --> 00:50:06,340
 no screens, no, nothing.

1535
00:50:06,340 --> 00:50:08,580
 And he also worked on the Manhattan Project,

1536
00:50:08,580 --> 00:50:09,780
 and he was in charge of the team

1537
00:50:09,780 --> 00:50:11,300
 which made the electronic triggers

1538
00:50:11,300 --> 00:50:13,420
 for the first nuclear bombs.

1539
00:50:13,420 --> 00:50:16,340
 So, that's the fact, it stacks up.

1540
00:50:16,340 --> 00:50:17,180
 - That's great. - And he played

1541
00:50:17,180 --> 00:50:18,460
 the accordion as well.

1542
00:50:18,460 --> 00:50:20,420
 And his daughter wrote a memoir about him

1543
00:50:20,420 --> 00:50:23,060
 called Accordion to Willy, which is...

1544
00:50:23,060 --> 00:50:26,300
 (laughing)

1545
00:50:26,300 --> 00:50:27,820
 - While we're talking about sort of like

1546
00:50:27,820 --> 00:50:30,420
 the founding figures of video gaming,

1547
00:50:30,420 --> 00:50:32,740
 one person who's known as the father

1548
00:50:32,740 --> 00:50:34,540
 of the video games industry,

1549
00:50:34,540 --> 00:50:36,380
 and I believe this is the person who kind of took it away

1550
00:50:36,380 --> 00:50:37,980
 from PC and said, the television,

1551
00:50:37,980 --> 00:50:39,940
 why are we not getting it on the television,

1552
00:50:39,940 --> 00:50:41,620
 was an engineer and inventor,

1553
00:50:41,620 --> 00:50:45,060
 and his name was Ralph Baer.

1554
00:50:45,060 --> 00:50:47,180
 - Oh, spelled the same as Clara.

1555
00:50:47,180 --> 00:50:50,940
 - Yes, and a translation that they are...

1556
00:50:50,940 --> 00:50:54,020
 No, they're not, I couldn't find any relation.

1557
00:50:54,020 --> 00:50:57,500
 I was so excited when I saw the connection, name, but no.

1558
00:50:57,500 --> 00:50:59,460
 - That's so funny. - Nothing, yeah.

1559
00:50:59,460 --> 00:51:01,820
 - Last game that I played to any regularity

1560
00:51:01,820 --> 00:51:04,500
 was Mario Kart, N64. - Oh yeah.

1561
00:51:04,500 --> 00:51:06,940
 - And there's a really nice economic theory

1562
00:51:06,940 --> 00:51:09,940
 that the world should be like Mario Kart.

1563
00:51:09,940 --> 00:51:11,340
 - Okay, they're all like,

1564
00:51:11,340 --> 00:51:13,100
 I can kind of see what you mean.

1565
00:51:13,100 --> 00:51:13,940
 - Oh really? - Yeah.

1566
00:51:13,940 --> 00:51:16,540
 If you're in the front in a game of Mario Kart,

1567
00:51:16,540 --> 00:51:18,380
 your power-ups are less powerful.

1568
00:51:18,380 --> 00:51:20,220
 So if you're first, you will get like,

1569
00:51:20,220 --> 00:51:23,180
 maybe a banana peel to throw behind you, which, yeah.

1570
00:51:23,180 --> 00:51:25,460
 But then if you're last, you will get a power-up

1571
00:51:25,460 --> 00:51:27,420
 that's like turns you on a torpedo.

1572
00:51:27,420 --> 00:51:29,500
 - A giant bullet guy, yeah. - Yeah, a giant bullet guy

1573
00:51:29,500 --> 00:51:32,580
 that can go to the top, or the blue shell,

1574
00:51:32,580 --> 00:51:35,140
 which automatically wipes out the person in first.

1575
00:51:35,140 --> 00:51:38,300
 So I guess in the sense that it kind of

1576
00:51:38,300 --> 00:51:40,580
 evens things out in society a little more.

1577
00:51:40,580 --> 00:51:42,900
 - Exactly, it's like Reverse Iron Rand, basically.

1578
00:51:42,900 --> 00:51:44,900
 And it's known as rubberbanding.

1579
00:51:44,900 --> 00:51:47,100
 And the idea is that anyone at the back of society

1580
00:51:47,100 --> 00:51:50,220
 gets a huge boost, and it helps everyone in society,

1581
00:51:50,220 --> 00:51:51,660
 especially as those people at the bottom

1582
00:51:51,660 --> 00:51:54,940
 tend to be like farmers or people who are helping

1583
00:51:54,940 --> 00:51:57,180
 at the base of everything.

1584
00:51:57,180 --> 00:51:58,980
 And apparently that would be a great way of doing it,

1585
00:51:58,980 --> 00:52:01,260
 apart from good luck finding anyone to vote for it.

1586
00:52:01,260 --> 00:52:02,900
 (all laughing)

1587
00:52:02,900 --> 00:52:03,740
 - That's really interesting.

1588
00:52:03,740 --> 00:52:06,260
 - That's a lovely idea. - I like that theory, yeah.

1589
00:52:06,260 --> 00:52:10,100
 - In 2004, someone made a device that is a Game Boy,

1590
00:52:10,100 --> 00:52:13,100
 and the Game Boy is also attached to kind of a thing

1591
00:52:13,100 --> 00:52:16,540
 that goes over your mouth, which gives you nitrous oxide

1592
00:52:16,540 --> 00:52:19,420
 and basically makes you pass out.

1593
00:52:19,420 --> 00:52:22,780
 And this was for children. - What was the function of?

1594
00:52:22,780 --> 00:52:24,260
 - To stop them playing?

1595
00:52:24,260 --> 00:52:25,660
 - No, no, not to stop them playing.

1596
00:52:25,660 --> 00:52:26,740
 - But as in you have enough nitrous oxide,

1597
00:52:26,740 --> 00:52:28,140
 you do well enough at the game, you pass out,

1598
00:52:28,140 --> 00:52:29,380
 you stop playing the Game Boy?

1599
00:52:29,380 --> 00:52:30,260
 - No, it's not that.

1600
00:52:30,260 --> 00:52:32,100
 Any other thoughts why you might do this?

1601
00:52:32,100 --> 00:52:33,260
 It's for children.

1602
00:52:33,260 --> 00:52:36,300
 - It's for children. - For children to pass out.

1603
00:52:36,300 --> 00:52:39,020
 - So if they're going into surgery and they need to--

1604
00:52:39,020 --> 00:52:41,140
 - Oh! - Oh my gosh!

1605
00:52:41,140 --> 00:52:42,860
 - Got it in one damn, yeah.

1606
00:52:42,860 --> 00:52:45,580
 So the idea is it's hard to give kids anesthesia

1607
00:52:45,580 --> 00:52:47,700
 and keep them calm while you're doing it.

1608
00:52:47,700 --> 00:52:49,380
 If you give them a Game Boy to play,

1609
00:52:49,380 --> 00:52:52,460
 then they're distracted and they get the anesthesia.

1610
00:52:52,460 --> 00:52:54,740
 And it was designed, but never--

1611
00:52:54,740 --> 00:52:56,260
 - Never used. - Never used.

1612
00:52:56,260 --> 00:52:58,300
 - Well, it's unfair on children who are not good at video,

1613
00:52:58,300 --> 00:52:59,500
 like I'm not very good at video games.

1614
00:52:59,500 --> 00:53:01,380
 So I would still be on lying there.

1615
00:53:01,380 --> 00:53:04,340
 - Now it's later, the surgeon's ready to go home.

1616
00:53:04,340 --> 00:53:06,940
 I might as well--

1617
00:53:06,940 --> 00:53:09,420
 - It's just the tutorial, come on!

1618
00:53:09,420 --> 00:53:11,660
 (laughing)

1619
00:53:11,660 --> 00:53:18,020
 - Okay, that's it.

1620
00:53:18,020 --> 00:53:19,060
 That is all of our facts.

1621
00:53:19,060 --> 00:53:20,380
