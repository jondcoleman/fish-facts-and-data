00:00:02,00:00:04,"Hi everyone, welcome to this week's episode"
00:00:04,00:00:06,of No Such Thing as a Fish.
00:00:06,00:00:09,Anna Tyshinski is still off on her hollybabs.
00:00:09,00:00:13,"And so we have for you a very, very special guest."
00:00:13,00:00:16,It is Melanie Bracewell.
00:00:16,00:00:19,Now those of you down under will know who Melanie is.
00:00:19,00:00:24,She is a regular on television in Australia and New Zealand.
00:00:24,00:00:26,She's recently been on New Zealand Taskmaster.
00:00:26,00:00:30,If anyone outside of New Zealand has naughtily managed
00:00:30,00:00:32,to get hold of that on the tubes.
00:00:32,00:00:34,(laughs)
00:00:34,00:00:36,You'll know her from that.
00:00:36,00:00:39,"But we've actually known Mel for many, many years."
00:00:39,00:00:42,We first met her when we did our New Zealand tour
00:00:42,00:00:43,many years ago.
00:00:43,00:00:45,We've been wanting to get her on the podcast
00:00:45,00:00:46,for ages and ages.
00:00:46,00:00:49,And finally she is in the UK and she came on the show.
00:00:49,00:00:51,And actually that brings me to the fact
00:00:51,00:00:54,that she is touring the UK at the moment.
00:00:54,00:00:57,"So if you listen to this podcast, you like what you hear."
00:00:57,00:00:59,I know you will 'cause she's absolutely brilliant.
00:00:59,00:01:00,She's so funny.
00:01:00,00:01:03,Then definitely get down to one of her gigs.
00:01:03,00:01:04,You'll have to get in there fast
00:01:04,00:01:07,because she is already right in the middle of that tour.
00:01:07,00:01:09,But if you listen to this as soon as it comes out
00:01:09,00:01:11,then you just about have enough time
00:01:11,00:01:13,"to get to her gigs in Stafford, Edinburgh,"
00:01:13,00:01:16,"Glasgow, London, Cambridge and Birmingham."
00:01:16,00:01:18,That's all happening in the next week or so.
00:01:18,00:01:21,And of course if you are in Australia or New Zealand
00:01:21,00:01:23,then she's doing loads of gigs down there.
00:01:23,00:01:25,And actually in the UK she'll be back
00:01:25,00:01:28,to do the Edinburgh Festival in the summer.
00:01:28,00:01:30,So if you want to know any more about Melanie
00:01:30,00:01:32,go to melaniebracewell.com.
00:01:32,00:01:34,And if you want to know where she's playing
00:01:34,00:01:38,then go to melaniebracewell.com/gigs.
00:01:38,00:01:40,Really hope you enjoy the show.
00:01:40,00:01:42,I'm absolutely certain you will.
00:01:42,00:01:45,So let's just say on with the podcast.

00:01:54,00:01:56,(upbeat music)
00:01:56,00:02:07,- Hello and welcome to another episode
00:02:07,00:02:09,"of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast"
00:02:09,00:02:12,coming to you from the QI offices in Hoburn.
00:02:12,00:02:13,My name is Dan Schreiber.
00:02:13,00:02:15,"I am sitting here with Andrew Hunter Murray,"
00:02:15,00:02:18,James Harkin and Melanie Bracewell.
00:02:18,00:02:20,And once again we have gathered round the microphones
00:02:20,00:02:23,with our four favourite facts from the last seven days
00:02:23,00:02:26,"and in no particular order, here we go."
00:02:26,00:02:29,"Starting with fact number one, that is Mel."
00:02:29,00:02:33,"- Yes, my fact this week is that a study of magpies"
00:02:33,00:02:36,in Australia has revealed that magpies
00:02:36,00:02:38,do not like to be studied.
00:02:38,00:02:42,So this was a study that they did
00:02:42,00:02:44,at the University of the Sunshine Coast.
00:02:44,00:02:46,They were trying to track flight patterns
00:02:46,00:02:47,and things of magpies.
00:02:47,00:02:48,They developed these very special trackers
00:02:48,00:02:51,that are only 1% of a magpies body weight.
00:02:51,00:02:54,This is perfect and they put these trackers on the birds
00:02:54,00:02:56,and they quickly just started pecking them away
00:02:56,00:02:58,"and they went, oh, they're not being very successful."
00:02:58,00:02:59,It'll be okay.
00:02:59,00:03:01,And then the other magpies came
00:03:01,00:03:05,and just helped them peck the trackers off of them.
00:03:05,00:03:08,"So at first they were sort of, you know,"
00:03:08,00:03:10,"you scratch my back, I'll scratch yours"
00:03:10,00:03:11,and they were pecking them off each other.
00:03:11,00:03:13,But then they found that other magpies
00:03:13,00:03:15,who didn't even have a tracker in the first place
00:03:15,00:03:18,were helping the other magpies to get rid of their trackers.
00:03:18,00:03:21,So they were showing behaviors of like ultrism.
00:03:21,00:03:23,"And so they were like, actually,"
00:03:23,00:03:24,this is quite a good study.
00:03:24,00:03:25,"- Oh, so that's how they know."
00:03:25,00:03:28,I was hoping they'd decoded like some calls of theirs
00:03:28,00:03:31,"and they would translate this piece off, mate."
00:03:31,00:03:32,"- Probably, yeah."
00:03:32,00:03:35,"- Actually, you know, 1% of your body weight"
00:03:35,00:03:36,would be almost a kilo.
00:03:36,00:03:37,- What are my clothes?
00:03:37,00:03:38,What are my clothes weigh?
00:03:38,00:03:39,I don't know.
00:03:39,00:03:41,- Let's weigh your clothes now.
00:03:41,00:03:43,"- No, let's not take them all off now and weigh them."
00:03:43,00:03:46,(laughing)
00:03:46,00:03:47,- But you do have a good point
00:03:47,00:03:50,because magpies do have a reputation for being dicks.
00:03:50,00:03:53,"They, but falsely."
00:03:53,00:03:57,So basically only eight to 10% of magpies will swoop people.
00:03:57,00:04:01,Only the male magpies and only in one month of the year.
00:04:01,00:04:02,- Hashtag not all magpies.
00:04:02,00:04:03,"- Yeah, exactly."
00:04:03,00:04:04,"- Well, this is a really interesting thing"
00:04:04,00:04:07,because magpies are over on this side of the planet as well.
00:04:07,00:04:09,"But Aussie magpies,"
00:04:09,00:04:12,they're actually a different species to the European magpie.
00:04:12,00:04:14,That's just not anything to do with each other.
00:04:14,00:04:15,"So I remember saying to people,"
00:04:15,00:04:18,"oh, magpie swoop and that being an alien concept here,"
00:04:18,00:04:19,but you live in Australia.
00:04:19,00:04:22,"You know the danger, the fear of walking down a street"
00:04:22,00:04:24,and a magpie swooping on you.
00:04:24,00:04:26,"- And the problem is, because they're very smart"
00:04:26,00:04:28,"and they recognize faces,"
00:04:28,00:04:30,"if they decide that they don't like you,"
00:04:30,00:04:31,they will target you.
00:04:31,00:04:34,So some people will just get swooped every day
00:04:34,00:04:36,on their way to work.
00:04:36,00:04:38,And so that's why they've earned that reputation.
00:04:38,00:04:39,- Have you been swooped?
00:04:39,00:04:40,"- I have been swooped once in my life,"
00:04:40,00:04:42,but my boyfriend loves birds a lot.
00:04:42,00:04:45,"And he has decided when we first moved to Australia,"
00:04:45,00:04:48,he was gonna become friends with all the magpies.
00:04:48,00:04:49,"So that's the other thing,"
00:04:49,00:04:51,"because they can recognize your face,"
00:04:51,00:04:53,you can actually make a friend for life.
00:04:53,00:04:55,And they stay in the same neighborhood.
00:04:55,00:04:56,So if you move into a neighborhood
00:04:56,00:04:57,"and there are magpies there,"
00:04:57,00:05:00,they will be the same magpies for like 20 years.
00:05:00,00:05:03,"- See, it's really high stakes when you move in."
00:05:03,00:05:05,You've got a chance to make a good impression.
00:05:05,00:05:07,"And if you blow it, long-term grudges are held."
00:05:07,00:05:10,"- I know you mean, but they only usually live"
00:05:10,00:05:11,for about five years.
00:05:11,00:05:14,"- Can't the family, like in the mafia,"
00:05:14,00:05:16,remember and bear a grudge?
00:05:16,00:05:18,"Didn't we save, I mean, that was crows,"
00:05:18,00:05:19,"we were talking about ages and ages ago,"
00:05:19,00:05:20,"I think crows, bear a grudge."
00:05:20,00:05:21,"- They do, yes."
00:05:21,00:05:25,And the school children are often targeted by magpies
00:05:25,00:05:27,because they often wear school uniforms.
00:05:27,00:05:30,"So if one child has thrown a rock at a magpie,"
00:05:30,00:05:33,they will then view all children as threats.
00:05:33,00:05:35,And so they'll just attack.
00:05:35,00:05:37,Same with like if they determine
00:05:37,00:05:39,if you're wearing like something covering your face
00:05:39,00:05:41,"or your head, say a bicelmet."
00:05:41,00:05:43,"They view that as a threat of like,"
00:05:43,00:05:45,what are you hiding from?
00:05:45,00:05:47,And then they will then swoop you for that.
00:05:47,00:05:49,- Does anyone come across Emma Glenfield
00:05:49,00:05:50,when you're doing this research?
00:05:50,00:05:51,- No.
00:05:51,00:05:53,- So we were talking about school kids.
00:05:53,00:05:56,She was in Australia and she'd been watching people
00:05:56,00:05:58,be swooped by these magpies.
00:05:58,00:06:01,"And she thought, it seems to me like they're going"
00:06:01,00:06:03,"for bold people more, the bold teachers,"
00:06:03,00:06:06,they seem to be going for the bold teachers.
00:06:06,00:06:07,"And she asked her mom, is this a thing?"
00:06:07,00:06:09,"And her mom said, well, I don't know if it's a thing,"
00:06:09,00:06:11,"you know, do your homework or whatever."
00:06:11,00:06:13,"And anyway, she decided to do a study."
00:06:13,00:06:15,So she went to her school
00:06:15,00:06:18,and she watched as these magpies swooped people
00:06:18,00:06:21,"and then did a survey of anyone who'd been swooped saying,"
00:06:21,00:06:22,"you know, how tall are you?"
00:06:22,00:06:24,What's your hairstyle?
00:06:24,00:06:25,What sex are you?
00:06:25,00:06:26,All that kind of stuff.
00:06:26,00:06:27,- What's your hairstyle?
00:06:27,00:06:28,None.
00:06:28,00:06:30,(laughing)
00:06:30,00:06:34,"- Well, then she's supposed to have 100 people"
00:06:34,00:06:37,"around the school, but then it went online"
00:06:37,00:06:39,"and she got 30,000 people to participate"
00:06:39,00:06:41,on her survey online.
00:06:41,00:06:44,"And she found that statistically,"
00:06:44,00:06:47,magpies are more likely to go for bold people.
00:06:47,00:06:50,"And according to a magpie expert called Darryl Jones,"
00:06:50,00:06:54,her study is the first time anyone's ever examined this link.
00:06:54,00:06:56,And so she's doing brand new science
00:06:56,00:06:57,and learn this about people.
00:06:57,00:06:59,- So you know what bold people should do then?
00:06:59,00:07:01,Draw a face on the back of their head.
00:07:01,00:07:02,- What?
00:07:02,00:07:05,- Magpies are less likely to go at anything that has eyes.
00:07:05,00:07:07,"And so if they're swooping from behind,"
00:07:07,00:07:09,they're just seeing a bold head all together.
00:07:09,00:07:10,"- Oh, that could be icy."
00:07:10,00:07:12,"- Yeah, so there are a few things"
00:07:12,00:07:14,that people think they've worked out
00:07:14,00:07:15,that magpies won't sweep out.
00:07:15,00:07:17,One is if you have eyes at the back of your head.
00:07:17,00:07:20,"So people often cyclists might often wear glasses,"
00:07:20,00:07:22,sunglasses on the back of their head facing that way
00:07:22,00:07:24,to give the impression there are eyes there.
00:07:24,00:07:26,"- A bit like in, is it in Africa,"
00:07:26,00:07:26,"we might have said before,"
00:07:26,00:07:29,where they draw eyes on the bums of cows?
00:07:29,00:07:30,"- Yes, exactly."
00:07:30,00:07:31,- Stop them being attacked by lions.
00:07:31,00:07:31,- Yeah.
00:07:31,00:07:32,- That's why that.
00:07:32,00:07:33,- 'Cause you can't be sneaked up on.
00:07:33,00:07:36,"- It's so funny, they're a protected national species."
00:07:36,00:07:39,"So if a magpie attacks you, you can't attack it back."
00:07:39,00:07:40,- You kind of just have to let it happen.
00:07:40,00:07:41,- Really?
00:07:41,00:07:42,- Yeah.
00:07:42,00:07:43,- That's funny.
00:07:43,00:07:44,- And so what they do then is if they've identified
00:07:44,00:07:47,"an aggressive magpie, they have to ship him out of there."
00:07:47,00:07:48,"But there's a minimum distance,"
00:07:48,00:07:50,which is like 25 kilometers.
00:07:50,00:07:52,So because they'll just fly back.
00:07:52,00:07:55,- They don't respect the restraining order.
00:07:55,00:07:57,- Have you heard of the Windsor Road monster?
00:07:57,00:07:58,- No.
00:07:58,00:08:01,"- That's an Australian magpie, specific one,"
00:08:01,00:08:03,which was especially aggressive
00:08:03,00:08:05,and had to be put down in the end.
00:08:05,00:08:07,But it took a very long time.
00:08:07,00:08:08,"I have to say, the Windsor Road monster"
00:08:08,00:08:11,has given multiple chances to learn and change.
00:08:11,00:08:14,"And it attacks, well, there were more than 40 complaints."
00:08:14,00:08:17,"One person had a heart attack shortly after being swooped,"
00:08:17,00:08:18,which is not the fact.
00:08:18,00:08:20,"- You know, there could be other things happening"
00:08:20,00:08:23,in that person's life that makes them more susceptible
00:08:23,00:08:23,to a heart attack.
00:08:23,00:08:24,- That's not true.
00:08:24,00:08:25,- It's not necessarily the--
00:08:25,00:08:26,"- That's true, that's true."
00:08:26,00:08:28,"But it didn't, no, you're right."
00:08:28,00:08:29,But it was going for people's faces.
00:08:29,00:08:32,It was going under cyclist's helmets to get them.
00:08:32,00:08:34,"It was even for an Australian magpie,"
00:08:34,00:08:36,it was being especially aggressive.
00:08:36,00:08:37,"- You're bowled under there, mate."
00:08:37,00:08:38,- What's going on?
00:08:38,00:08:39,Where are you hiding?
00:08:39,00:08:41,- They're just trying to protect their ground.
00:08:41,00:08:45,They spend most of their life just protecting their area.
00:08:45,00:08:48,"So they choose their radius, and it's quite small."
00:08:48,00:08:51,"And they will just spend the whole time just standing,"
00:08:51,00:08:54,"like, as bounces on the edge of their patch,"
00:08:54,00:08:57,"being like, don't come in here all the time."
00:08:57,00:08:59,- So there was one cyclist who I read about
00:08:59,00:09:01,"called Dr. Richard Osborne,"
00:09:01,00:09:04,who came up with this new cycle helmet.
00:09:04,00:09:07,- I don't think I've seen this.
00:09:07,00:09:08,- Does it have a face on it?
00:09:08,00:09:09,"- No, it doesn't have a face."
00:09:09,00:09:10,Can you guess what it is?
00:09:10,00:09:14,He uses a thing I have around my house
00:09:14,00:09:16,to scare them away.
00:09:16,00:09:18,"- So I know this, so I won't guess."
00:09:18,00:09:19,"- Yeah, okay, melts out."
00:09:19,00:09:21,- I could have seemed really smart.
00:09:21,00:09:23,"- Oh, stop using James' personality to look out for it."
00:09:23,00:09:25,- It was a golf club.
00:09:25,00:09:27,- What do you know about things that happened in my life
00:09:27,00:09:28,in the last two weeks?
00:09:28,00:09:29,- The last two weeks?
00:09:29,00:09:31,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:09:31,00:09:33,All my family members.
00:09:33,00:09:36,- Your kid has had a birthday.
00:09:36,00:09:37,- Yeah.
00:09:37,00:09:39,- Your daughter's two years old.
00:09:39,00:09:40,- Yeah.
00:09:40,00:09:42,"- So you see, you put the hours in with people then."
00:09:42,00:09:47,- What a way to find out that's your daughter's birthday.
00:09:47,00:09:48,(all laughing)
00:09:48,00:09:50,"- Oh no, Uncle Dan hasn't forgotten about you."
00:09:50,00:09:52,"No, no, he's been very busy."
00:09:52,00:09:54,I'm sure the gifts on its way.
00:09:54,00:09:55,- Oh my God.
00:09:55,00:09:58,"- She built a helmet to ward Dan away, I think, yeah."
00:09:58,00:10:01,- Does the bike have a mortal baby pinioned on top of it?
00:10:01,00:10:03,- A little bit or a doll.
00:10:03,00:10:05,"- It has, you know, these party blowers"
00:10:05,00:10:07,"where you blow them and they go, pfft."
00:10:07,00:10:08,And they kind of stick out.
00:10:08,00:10:10,He has those attached to his helmet
00:10:10,00:10:12,and there's a tube attached to them.
00:10:12,00:10:14,"So the, and Magpie comes there,"
00:10:14,00:10:17,"he blows into the tube and they all go, pfft."
00:10:17,00:10:18,"- Is this what you were thinking, though?"
00:10:18,00:10:19,- No.
00:10:19,00:10:21,(all laughing)
00:10:21,00:10:23,- I just see the guy who had tied a lot of cable ties
00:10:23,00:10:24,to his hair.
00:10:24,00:10:25,- That's very funny.
00:10:25,00:10:28,"- And does he, has it sort of caught on?"
00:10:28,00:10:30,"- Yeah, well, no, it's not caught on"
00:10:30,00:10:31,"because he looks like an idiot,"
00:10:31,00:10:35,but you said it seemed a bit safer than carrying a stick
00:10:35,00:10:37,"and waving it around, which was his other option."
00:10:37,00:10:39,"- Yeah, or having spikes, which a lot of people do,"
00:10:39,00:10:41,"they're not sharp spikes, but they are sticky out."
00:10:41,00:10:42,- Is that right?
00:10:42,00:10:43,"- Yeah, yeah, just as a deterrent."
00:10:43,00:10:46,- The best thing to do is to just be nice to them.
00:10:46,00:10:47,- Yeah.
00:10:47,00:10:47,- Because they will remember you being nice.
00:10:47,00:10:49,"So what happens is people run away and they go,"
00:10:49,00:10:51,"oh, you are guilty, why are you running?"
00:10:51,00:10:55,"Therefore, it just fills this prophecy in their head."
00:10:55,00:10:57,"- But to be nice to them, if you're in their area,"
00:10:57,00:10:59,"so you just, how can you be nice?"
00:10:59,00:11:00,- You just feed them.
00:11:00,00:11:02,You just leave them out like little peanuts and things.
00:11:02,00:11:04,"That's what my boyfriend has been trying to do,"
00:11:04,00:11:07,like leaving peanuts outside our yard and getting them to come.
00:11:07,00:11:09,"And yes, and then when they like you,"
00:11:09,00:11:11,"they'll bring their kids along to be like,"
00:11:11,00:11:13,"here's my kids, you miss the good day."
00:11:13,00:11:17,- One nice thing that you can do for them
00:11:17,00:11:19,"is actually something that will get you in trouble with them,"
00:11:19,00:11:22,which is if you see one of their babies struggling
00:11:22,00:11:23,"and you go to help it,"
00:11:23,00:11:25,they will view that as you hurting their babies
00:11:25,00:11:26,'cause they haven't introduced you to it.
00:11:26,00:11:28,So be careful how nice you are.
00:11:28,00:11:30,- And that's why you didn't give a gift.
00:11:30,00:11:33,As nice as they viewed as a threat.
00:11:33,00:11:35,"- Playgrounds, playgrounds are like that, you know."
00:11:35,00:11:36,- Are they?
00:11:36,00:11:36,"- Well, if you see a child that's struggling"
00:11:36,00:11:37,"and you go over to help it,"
00:11:37,00:11:38,"their parents might think,"
00:11:38,00:11:40,"""Who's this guy who's approaching my child?"""
00:11:40,00:11:41,- Yes.
00:11:41,00:11:42,(laughing)
00:11:42,00:11:42,"- ""This guy's left the fence."
00:11:42,00:11:44,"""I can't remember not to wear my costume"
00:11:44,00:11:45,"""when I'm doing that."""
00:11:45,00:11:46,(laughing)
00:11:46,00:11:48,- I'm weighing my clothes.
00:11:48,00:11:50,(laughing)
00:11:50,00:11:54,- Do you have lots of superstitions about them in Australia?
00:11:54,00:11:56,"- I have heard of these superstitions,"
00:11:56,00:12:00,but I don't think I follow them in my day to day life.
00:12:00,00:12:02,"- 'Cause that's pretty much what they're well known for here,"
00:12:02,00:12:03,right?
00:12:03,00:12:04,"- Yeah, I follow quite a few."
00:12:04,00:12:05,"- So when you see one,"
00:12:05,00:12:07,"do you say like, ""Hello, Mr. Magpie."
00:12:07,00:12:09,"""Where's your wife?"" or something?"
00:12:09,00:12:10,"- Good morning, my Lord,"
00:12:10,00:12:11,and how's your wife and children?
00:12:11,00:12:11,Yes.
00:12:11,00:12:12,- Right.
00:12:12,00:12:13,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:12:13,00:12:14,- And do you do that?
00:12:14,00:12:15,"- I do, yeah."
00:12:15,00:12:16,- And what about if you see one on its own?
00:12:16,00:12:18,"Seeing two is fine, three is fine, whatever."
00:12:18,00:12:20,"And one on its own, bad luck, so you just quickly, you know."
00:12:20,00:12:22,"- 'Cause in Australia, that's a lot to get out"
00:12:22,00:12:23,"while it's coming for your eyes, isn't it?"
00:12:23,00:12:26,"- Yeah, exactly, that's very, ah!"
00:12:26,00:12:28,"That's it, yeah, that's what I'm gonna say, yeah."
00:12:28,00:12:30,"But no, there are all these things,"
00:12:30,00:12:33,like the magpie landed on the cross
00:12:33,00:12:35,"when Christ was being crucified,"
00:12:35,00:12:37,or the tongue of a magpie contains a drop of blood
00:12:37,00:12:39,from the devil himself.
00:12:39,00:12:41,"- I think if they open their mouth,"
00:12:41,00:12:43,"there is a little bit of red in there, isn't there?"
00:12:43,00:12:46,I think that's why they associated with Jesus.
00:12:46,00:12:47,- And that's why if you scratch its tongue
00:12:47,00:12:48,with the edge of a silver sixpence
00:12:48,00:12:50,"and put a drop of blood into the wound,"
00:12:50,00:12:52,it will gain the power of speech.
00:12:52,00:12:55,(all laughing)
00:12:55,00:12:56,- We've all been there.
00:12:56,00:12:57,(all laughing)
00:12:57,00:12:59,- There's so much slander about them
00:12:59,00:13:01,"from back in the day, particularly religious."
00:13:01,00:13:04,"So the one about the crucifix, apparently,"
00:13:04,00:13:06,it was the only bird not to cry
00:13:06,00:13:10,"when Jesus was crucified, and that was big news."
00:13:10,00:13:11,"And then in the 19th century, there was a vicar"
00:13:11,00:13:13,who said it was the only bird
00:13:13,00:13:14,"that refused to go on Noah's Ark,"
00:13:14,00:13:19,"rather it just wanted, it hung outside swearing instead."
00:13:19,00:13:21,"In France, the idea is that a magpie"
00:13:21,00:13:24,is a reincarnated evil nun.
00:13:24,00:13:26,"- I can see it, I guess."
00:13:26,00:13:27,(all laughing)
00:13:27,00:13:29,- British magpies eat a lot of dog poo.
00:13:29,00:13:31,"- Oh, wow. - Yeah."
00:13:31,00:13:33,"Even if there's other food around,"
00:13:33,00:13:34,they'll eat the dog. - Really?
00:13:34,00:13:35,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:13:35,00:13:38,And to such the extent that people in parks
00:13:38,00:13:39,"have noticed that they'll,"
00:13:39,00:13:41,"'cause they're quite smart, obviously, magpies,"
00:13:41,00:13:44,"they'll go to the dog poo bins,"
00:13:44,00:13:45,"pull out a bag of dog poo,"
00:13:45,00:13:47,"rip open the bag of dog poo,"
00:13:47,00:13:48,and then have a little snack.
00:13:48,00:13:50,"- Oh, my God. - Oh, my God."
00:13:50,00:13:51,- That's some self-respect.
00:13:51,00:13:53,- What? - That was awful.
00:13:53,00:13:55,- It was nutritious. - Might taste great.
00:13:55,00:13:57,"- I've never tried it, I don't know if it's good or not."
00:13:57,00:13:58,- Oh. (all laughing)
00:13:58,00:13:59,"- I just wanted to say, we don't know."
00:13:59,00:14:01,"- You said, ""Might taste great."""
00:14:01,00:14:01,"- Yeah. - And I heard you saying,"
00:14:01,00:14:02,"""Mine tastes great."""
00:14:02,00:14:03,(all laughing)
00:14:03,00:14:05,"- Actually, I'm just gonna gloss on the move past it,"
00:14:05,00:14:07,"'cause, you know, we've got a guest."
00:14:07,00:14:09,"- You guys at a park,"
00:14:09,00:14:11,"is that you're trying to go through the dog poo,"
00:14:11,00:14:13,you're naked at a playground.
00:14:13,00:14:14,(all laughing)
00:14:14,00:14:15,It's a whole image.
00:14:15,00:14:18,- James has got a party before he was scammed out his head.
00:14:18,00:14:19,"- Yeah. - Oh, my God."
00:14:19,00:14:21,- They do have them in New Zealand.
00:14:21,00:14:22,"- They do, yes. - My pies, don't they?"
00:14:22,00:14:24,But they've come over from Australia.
00:14:24,00:14:26,"Apparently, no one's trying to get rid of them in New Zealand."
00:14:26,00:14:27,"You know, like in New Zealand,"
00:14:27,00:14:29,there's quite a lot of invasive species
00:14:29,00:14:30,and they're trying to get rid of them.
00:14:30,00:14:32,"Well, they're not doing it with my pies"
00:14:32,00:14:34,"because it's too hard, basically."
00:14:34,00:14:35,- Yeah. - You get rid of two magpies
00:14:35,00:14:39,from an area and then the next two will move in.
00:14:39,00:14:41,"But apparently, what I read is they've got"
00:14:41,00:14:45,"a bad reputation in New Zealand, these magpies,"
00:14:45,00:14:47,"because they're big, showy, noisy,"
00:14:47,00:14:50,"and according to the article, it must be said, ""Australian."""
00:14:50,00:14:52,"- Oh, yes. (laughing)"
00:14:52,00:14:54,That really does rub us the wrong way.
00:14:54,00:14:56,That's how I can understand it.
00:14:56,00:14:58,(laughing)
00:14:58,00:15:01,- Did you hear of these acclimatisation societies?
00:15:01,00:15:03,"- Yes. - 'Cause that was,"
00:15:03,00:15:04,"they're Australian magpies,"
00:15:04,00:15:07,"but they were introduced to New Zealand by societies saying,"
00:15:07,00:15:08,"I'm not sure what the rationale was actually,"
00:15:08,00:15:10,'cause it was not as though they were gonna be hunted or--
00:15:10,00:15:12,"- Well, they thought that there wasn't enough"
00:15:12,00:15:14,nice animals in New Zealand.
00:15:14,00:15:17,"- And in fact, I've heard that a lot, yeah, famously."
00:15:17,00:15:19,"- Yeah, well, they were like, you know, there's not--"
00:15:19,00:15:23,"- There's no endemic mammals to New Zealand,"
00:15:23,00:15:27,"apart from a bat, so any mammals weren't really there."
00:15:27,00:15:29,"- They got there, and they're like, ""Where's the rabbits?"""
00:15:29,00:15:30,"- Yeah. - You know,"
00:15:30,00:15:31,"""Where's the tweeting birds?"""
00:15:31,00:15:33,We don't know where they are.
00:15:33,00:15:35,"- But I feel like it's such a bird-heavy place,"
00:15:35,00:15:37,"or certainly would have been in the 19th century,"
00:15:37,00:15:40,"as in, why would you introduce more birds, you know?"
00:15:40,00:15:42,"- Yeah, they're like, maybe some that can fly"
00:15:42,00:15:45,"would be useful. - Yeah, exactly."
00:15:45,00:15:46,"Like the cacophore, that's a New Zealand one as well."
00:15:46,00:15:48,"- Yeah, but a lot of them kind of hide"
00:15:48,00:15:50,"in the middle of the night. - Yeah, yeah."
00:15:50,00:15:54,"- Even the kiwi bird, I don't think I've ever seen one."
00:15:54,00:15:55,"- Really? - You go to the zoo,"
00:15:55,00:15:59,"and they say they're in there, but I don't reckon they are."
00:15:59,00:16:01,I think it's just they've put a red light
00:16:01,00:16:04,"in a cave-looking area, and they go, ""There's kiwi in there."""
00:16:04,00:16:06,(all laugh)
00:16:06,00:16:08,"- Tasmanian devils, I've gone every year"
00:16:08,00:16:11,"to see a Tasmanian devil at Taronga Zoo in Sydney,"
00:16:11,00:16:12,and you never see one.
00:16:12,00:16:13,- You never see them spinning around like a tornado.
00:16:13,00:16:15,"- Yeah, no, no, no, no."
00:16:15,00:16:18,"- You do hear a little bit of that in the background, but yeah."
00:16:18,00:16:20,(upbeat music)
00:16:20,00:16:25,"- Okay, it is time for fact number two, that is James."
00:16:25,00:16:28,"- Okay, my fact this week is that the sport of netball"
00:16:28,00:16:32,was invented because its creator thought basketball
00:16:32,00:16:35,made women grow better and lose control.
00:16:35,00:16:37,"- Wow, as a player of both sports,"
00:16:37,00:16:38,I will say this is true.
00:16:38,00:16:40,(laughs)
00:16:40,00:16:42,"I play social netball, you know,"
00:16:42,00:16:45,and it's always very wholesome.
00:16:45,00:16:47,"The slogan of netball is just, ""Here if you need,"""
00:16:47,00:16:49,it's so beautiful.
00:16:49,00:16:50,"That's just what you say a lot, you know,"
00:16:50,00:16:52,"when you pass the ball, you go, ""Here if you need,"""
00:16:52,00:16:53,"like, you know, like, ""Pass them on me,"""
00:16:53,00:16:55,"you say, ""Here if you need,"" like, ""I'm over here."""
00:16:55,00:16:57,"It's very wholesome, but then I play basketball"
00:16:57,00:16:59,and I become a feral beast.
00:16:59,00:17:01,(all laugh)
00:17:01,00:17:02,- It's so interesting.
00:17:02,00:17:05,- So what's the key difference that causes that?
00:17:05,00:17:07,- I don't know if this is--
00:17:07,00:17:09,"- Well, basketball is technically no contact."
00:17:09,00:17:11,- But you're trying to take the ball off someone
00:17:11,00:17:12,and you can run beside them.
00:17:12,00:17:15,"So basics of netball is once you catch the ball,"
00:17:15,00:17:17,you can't move.
00:17:17,00:17:19,"If you're taking a shot, no one can defend you."
00:17:19,00:17:21,"- They can, with three feet away."
00:17:21,00:17:23,"- From three feet away, which is, I would argue,"
00:17:23,00:17:23,too many feet.
00:17:23,00:17:25,(all laugh)
00:17:25,00:17:26,- And you can't dribble along the court.
00:17:26,00:17:28,"- You can't dribble, okay, okay, okay, okay."
00:17:28,00:17:32,"- So anyway, this all comes from a woman called Clara Bear"
00:17:32,00:17:35,"who was working at Newcombe College in New Orleans,"
00:17:35,00:17:37,and she'd been asked to come up with a new sport
00:17:37,00:17:39,for women to play because this was an old women's school.
00:17:39,00:17:42,"And she decided, she came up with a few ideas,"
00:17:42,00:17:44,but her main one was to adapt sports
00:17:44,00:17:45,of being played by men.
00:17:45,00:17:48,"So basketball had just become really popular,"
00:17:48,00:17:51,been invented by James Naismith a few years earlier.
00:17:51,00:17:54,And so she wrote to him and asked for the rules.
00:17:54,00:17:55,"She got the rules and said, right,"
00:17:55,00:17:56,we're gonna play basketball.
00:17:56,00:17:59,But anyone who was there said it was a mad game
00:17:59,00:18:02,in which the women grew bitter and lost control.
00:18:02,00:18:05,Even she herself said it was not entirely satisfactory.
00:18:05,00:18:07,"And so she thought, well, I'm gonna have to invent"
00:18:07,00:18:09,a new game which doesn't have all this stuff
00:18:09,00:18:11,because this is just not appropriate to women.
00:18:11,00:18:12,And so she came up with that ball.
00:18:12,00:18:13,- Interesting.
00:18:13,00:18:16,"You say that netball is a non-contact sport,"
00:18:16,00:18:18,but I don't think it actually is
00:18:18,00:18:20,because non-contact would be something like tennis
00:18:20,00:18:22,where you genuinely don't touch anyone else.
00:18:22,00:18:24,"But netball, there are certain rules."
00:18:24,00:18:27,So if I was to run into the space to get the ball
00:18:27,00:18:28,and someone else is running in
00:18:28,00:18:31,"and I shoulder barge them on the way,"
00:18:31,00:18:33,that is really one of the rules of the game.
00:18:33,00:18:36,"Like there is, the art of learning to play netball"
00:18:36,00:18:39,is to learn how to be very aggressive
00:18:39,00:18:40,within the confines of the rules.
00:18:40,00:18:42,"- Oh, yeah, yeah, okay."
00:18:42,00:18:44,"Yeah, we used to play it at school."
00:18:44,00:18:45,And I went to a city.
00:18:45,00:18:46,"Yeah, I went to a Steiner school."
00:18:46,00:18:47,"So I think that was more,"
00:18:47,00:18:49,"feels like a made up Steiner sport, really."
00:18:49,00:18:51,Steiner's a very hippie non-competitive kind of thing.
00:18:51,00:18:53,"And it feels like instead of basketball,"
00:18:53,00:18:54,let's do netball instead.
00:18:54,00:18:56,- So can I check a few more rules?
00:18:56,00:18:57,- Yeah.
00:18:57,00:18:59,"- So Mel, is there still no shouting"
00:18:59,00:19:01,or talking during the game?
00:19:01,00:19:02,Is that still observed?
00:19:02,00:19:04,- Interesting.
00:19:04,00:19:05,Where is that from?
00:19:05,00:19:07,Is that from the most recent rule?
00:19:07,00:19:10,- That was from Clara Bear's founding rules
00:19:10,00:19:11,right off the game.
00:19:11,00:19:13,"- You can't talk back to the umpire,"
00:19:13,00:19:15,"so you couldn't say, ""Oh, what was that?"""
00:19:15,00:19:17,"- In the first rules for sure,"
00:19:17,00:19:19,"if you spoke, if you said anything in the game,"
00:19:19,00:19:20,it was a foul.
00:19:20,00:19:21,"- Oh, wow!"
00:19:21,00:19:22,- Even here if you need.
00:19:22,00:19:24,"- Yeah, you won't have to say that."
00:19:24,00:19:27,"- I read no falling over was also a rid, which I can't."
00:19:27,00:19:29,- Don't struggle to compute.
00:19:29,00:19:30,"- That seems a bit harsh, doesn't it?"
00:19:30,00:19:31,"- Yeah, it does."
00:19:31,00:19:34,- It's a weird rule that there's sort of a hangover there.
00:19:34,00:19:36,"If you catch the ball and you fall over,"
00:19:36,00:19:37,"you're not allowed to move with the ball,"
00:19:37,00:19:39,"but if you are on the ground,"
00:19:39,00:19:41,you can't throw the ball from the ground.
00:19:41,00:19:42,- What?
00:19:42,00:19:44,- So you have to make your way back up to standing
00:19:44,00:19:46,before you can throw the ball.
00:19:46,00:19:47,But you have to keep your feet planted.
00:19:47,00:19:49,"So where your feet landed when you fell over,"
00:19:49,00:19:51,you have to just weirdly stand up.
00:19:51,00:19:54,- Do you look like one of those inflatable car selling
00:19:54,00:19:55,balloon guns?
00:19:55,00:19:57,"- You just have to rise up, yeah."
00:19:57,00:19:58,"- That's great, that's brilliant."
00:19:58,00:20:00,"- That's a good rule, I like that."
00:20:00,00:20:04,- She also said no needlessly rough play was in her rules.
00:20:04,00:20:07,And all shots had to be taken with one hand.
00:20:07,00:20:09,Because there was a thought that by throwing it
00:20:09,00:20:11,"with two hands, it was unladylike"
00:20:11,00:20:15,and might somehow make women less feminine was the idea.
00:20:15,00:20:18,- I read there would be inclination of the shoulders forward
00:20:18,00:20:21,with consequent flattening of the chest.
00:20:21,00:20:22,"- Precisely, yeah."
00:20:22,00:20:24,- And that would not be a graceful position for girls.
00:20:24,00:20:24,- That's what they said.
00:20:24,00:20:26,But it's interesting because the one-handed throw
00:20:26,00:20:28,"was in netball from the very start,"
00:20:28,00:20:30,they had one-handed throw.
00:20:30,00:20:31,"But in basketball, there was none of it"
00:20:31,00:20:33,until about the 1930s.
00:20:33,00:20:35,It was all two-handed throwing into the baskets.
00:20:35,00:20:36,"- As a rule, was it?"
00:20:36,00:20:37,"- No, it's just that was the way."
00:20:37,00:20:38,"- That was the way they did it, yeah."
00:20:38,00:20:41,"- Yeah, I love as well that she basically,"
00:20:41,00:20:43,she originally was starting basketball
00:20:43,00:20:45,as a female version of it.
00:20:45,00:20:47,And she called it basketball.
00:20:47,00:20:49,She just changed it to QUE.
00:20:49,00:20:51,"- Well, I think what happened there is,"
00:20:51,00:20:53,she wrote to Naismith who came up with the original thing.
00:20:53,00:20:57,"And she said, here's my new sport, what do you think?"
00:20:57,00:20:58,It's women's basketball.
00:20:58,00:20:59,"And he wrote back saying, well,"
00:20:59,00:21:01,it's not really the same as basketball.
00:21:01,00:21:03,So you should change the name a little bit.
00:21:03,00:21:05,"And she said, okay, I'll change it to basketball."
00:21:05,00:21:07,- And then part of the rules were developed
00:21:07,00:21:09,because she just misunderstood what he'd sent back.
00:21:09,00:21:11,There were dots all over it.
00:21:11,00:21:13,And she took that to mean seven different zones.
00:21:13,00:21:15,So you would be stuck in your zone.
00:21:15,00:21:17,And that got applied to the initial rules.
00:21:17,00:21:18,- We should not still change.
00:21:18,00:21:22,"- Yeah, yeah, a goalkeeper is still in one-third of the court."
00:21:22,00:21:25,"A center can go in most of the court, but not the two."
00:21:25,00:21:26,It's very complicated.
00:21:26,00:21:28,"- It's not very sociable, is it?"
00:21:28,00:21:31,"Like if, yeah, there's some people who never really see it."
00:21:31,00:21:31,- Exactly.
00:21:31,00:21:34,"Like I will chat to a goal shooter as a goalkeeper a lot,"
00:21:34,00:21:37,but I will never see my team's goal shooter.
00:21:37,00:21:38,"I just go, oh, well done."
00:21:38,00:21:40,(all laughing)
00:21:40,00:21:43,- But it's safe and the women look very womenly as a result.
00:21:43,00:21:45,(all laughing)
00:21:45,00:21:46,- What a relief.
00:21:46,00:21:48,- The vision has remained from Clara Bear.
00:21:48,00:21:49,"- Do you play volleyball as well, Mel?"
00:21:49,00:21:50,- I don't.
00:21:50,00:21:53,"I just play netball and basketball, yeah."
00:21:53,00:21:56,- 'Cause apparently volleyball may have been nicked
00:21:56,00:22:00,"basically a month after the first game of Newcombe ball,"
00:22:00,00:22:03,"which was another, Clara Bear invented Newcombe ball,"
00:22:03,00:22:04,but you throw the ball into the other team's area
00:22:04,00:22:05,so it hits the floor.
00:22:05,00:22:06,- Yes.
00:22:06,00:22:07,- Without them being able to catch it.
00:22:07,00:22:10,"One month after that first game was written up,"
00:22:10,00:22:13,"William Morgan, the YMCA director in the USA,"
00:22:13,00:22:14,he invented volleyball.
00:22:14,00:22:16,And it was basically apparently for older businessmen
00:22:16,00:22:18,"on their lunch hour, was how it was described."
00:22:18,00:22:20,Which I think it has not stayed true to
00:22:20,00:22:21,"over the years, volleyball."
00:22:21,00:22:23,- You know beach volleyball?
00:22:23,00:22:24,- Yeah.
00:22:24,00:22:25,- There's an official rule that you're only allowed
00:22:25,00:22:27,to wear one watch.
00:22:27,00:22:28,"- Oh, really?"
00:22:28,00:22:29,- It's in the actual rules.
00:22:29,00:22:31,It says only one watch allowed.
00:22:31,00:22:33,- What possible advantage do you gain from two watches?
00:22:33,00:22:34,- What do you think?
00:22:34,00:22:35,- How interesting.
00:22:35,00:22:37,- Do you know what time it is in another part of the club?
00:22:37,00:22:39,(all laughing)
00:22:39,00:22:40,- Do you know the answer?
00:22:40,00:22:41,"- I think I do, yeah."
00:22:41,00:22:42,"- Okay, so what advantage would you have?"
00:22:42,00:22:43,"- I mean, you'd never get a point."
00:22:43,00:22:45,- I have a punt.
00:22:45,00:22:47,Is it that people were doing sponsorship deals
00:22:47,00:22:48,with multiple watch companies?
00:22:48,00:22:49,- I can't believe that today.
00:22:49,00:22:50,- Interesting.
00:22:50,00:22:51,"- Oh, that's great."
00:22:51,00:22:52,- 'Cause there's actually some rules
00:22:52,00:22:55,about how many temporary tattoos you're allowed
00:22:55,00:22:57,because people use those for appetizers.
00:22:57,00:22:58,- No.
00:22:58,00:22:59,"- Obviously, don't have--"
00:22:59,00:22:59,- Small real estate.
00:22:59,00:23:00,- Yeah.
00:23:00,00:23:02,(all laughing)
00:23:02,00:23:02,- Exactly.
00:23:02,00:23:03,- Yeah.
00:23:03,00:23:04,"- It's so funny, isn't it?"
00:23:04,00:23:06,- Because netball is so big in New Zealand and Australia.
00:23:06,00:23:09,I wasn't sure how much you guys knew about the sport.
00:23:09,00:23:10,I know you play in England.
00:23:10,00:23:12,You've got a very popular team.
00:23:12,00:23:14,"But I was like, oh, I wonder what some unknown facts"
00:23:14,00:23:15,about netball.
00:23:15,00:23:18,"So of course, I looked it up and I found an article titled"
00:23:18,00:23:22,"""Fascinating Facts About Netball That You Never Knew."""
00:23:22,00:23:25,"Number one was, ""How long is a netball game?"""
00:23:25,00:23:27,(all laughing)
00:23:27,00:23:28,"- Okay, well, let's try."
00:23:28,00:23:29,Does anyone here know how long it is?
00:23:29,00:23:30,"- Actually, I do not know."
00:23:30,00:23:33,I would guess it's 80 minutes.
00:23:33,00:23:34,"- Oh, I think it's less."
00:23:34,00:23:38,"I've watched games, but I can't remember how long they were."
00:23:38,00:23:40,I reckon maybe 60 minutes and quarters.
00:23:40,00:23:41,"- Yeah, that's what I'm thinking."
00:23:41,00:23:42,"I'm trying to work out, is it quarters as well?"
00:23:42,00:23:43,"And so I'm gonna say 60,"
00:23:43,00:23:45,'cause I heard you just say yes.
00:23:45,00:23:47,(all laughing)
00:23:47,00:23:49,"- Yes, I acknowledge your answer and it's incorrect."
00:23:49,00:23:51,"No, no, it is actually."
00:23:51,00:23:52,It's for 15 minute quarters.
00:23:52,00:23:54,- Fascinating fact.
00:23:54,00:23:55,"- Yes, fascinating fact."
00:23:55,00:23:57,"- Number two, ""What is netball?"""
00:23:57,00:23:59,(all laughing)
00:23:59,00:24:02,"I think it's a real entry-level article,"
00:24:02,00:24:04,that I had come across.
00:24:04,00:24:06,- I love the way that the first thing you need to learn
00:24:06,00:24:07,is how long it is.
00:24:07,00:24:10,"And then the second one is, ""What is it?"""
00:24:10,00:24:11,"It's like, ""Do you wanna play netball?"""
00:24:11,00:24:12,"Well, how long will it be?"
00:24:12,00:24:13,(all laughing)
00:24:13,00:24:14,- 60 minutes.
00:24:14,00:24:15,It's got two watches on.
00:24:15,00:24:17,(all laughing)
00:24:17,00:24:18,- You're right.
00:24:18,00:24:20,So I grew up in Oz for my teenage years.
00:24:20,00:24:22,"Netball was massive there,"
00:24:22,00:24:24,and I assumed it was globally massive.
00:24:24,00:24:25,"It's an American invention, but in America,"
00:24:25,00:24:26,it's not really played.
00:24:26,00:24:28,"It's getting back now,"
00:24:28,00:24:30,and particularly Aussies and New Zealanders
00:24:30,00:24:33,keep going over to schools to try and reintegrate it.
00:24:33,00:24:36,So Ross Day is someone who went over to try and get it done.
00:24:36,00:24:38,"And she said, ""What are the biggest challenges?"""
00:24:38,00:24:40,I can't believe this is true.
00:24:40,00:24:41,Must be target cheek.
00:24:41,00:24:42,"She says, ""One of the biggest challenges"
00:24:42,00:24:44,"""is that when we're pitching netball,"
00:24:44,00:24:46,"""is that because of our accents being Aussie and New Zealand,"
00:24:46,00:24:48,"""everyone thinks we're saying nipple."""
00:24:48,00:24:53,"- Yes, I get this, I will say something about nipple,"
00:24:53,00:24:56,"and I'll be like, ""Oh, that was a great netball play."""
00:24:56,00:24:59,And it has a whole different meaning.
00:24:59,00:24:59,"And the comments, people are like,"
00:24:59,00:25:01,"""What are you talking about?"""
00:25:01,00:25:03,"- Wow, so someone will come up to you and say,"
00:25:03,00:25:05,"""Do you want a better nipple play?"""
00:25:05,00:25:07,"And you go, ""How long will it be?"""
00:25:07,00:25:09,(all laughing)
00:25:09,00:25:10,"- Wait, quick double check."
00:25:10,00:25:11,It is what you think it is.
00:25:11,00:25:12,What is nipple?
00:25:12,00:25:14,(all laughing)
00:25:14,00:25:15,- That's so funny.
00:25:15,00:25:18,- I like the early forms of basketball
00:25:18,00:25:19,were interesting as well.
00:25:19,00:25:23,"I like how they first started with a peach basket,"
00:25:23,00:25:26,but they didn't think to put a hole in the bottom.
00:25:26,00:25:30,"So, in the early games, they would have to stop the game"
00:25:30,00:25:32,to go retrieve the ball from the basket
00:25:32,00:25:34,and climb up a ladder.
00:25:34,00:25:36,"- I suppose, in a way, if you have a hole,"
00:25:36,00:25:38,it's not always certain if the ball's gone in.
00:25:38,00:25:40,"- Yeah, that is true."
00:25:40,00:25:41,- Is that producing netball?
00:25:41,00:25:42,"- Sometimes, if I shoot in it,"
00:25:42,00:25:44,"'cause you go for the swish sound,"
00:25:44,00:25:46,but sometimes you could just shoot so far
00:25:46,00:25:48,that it just hits the net and makes that sound anyway.
00:25:48,00:25:50,"And you go, ""Oh, okay, I know."""
00:25:50,00:25:52,(all laughing)
00:25:52,00:25:55,"- In football, in soccer, there's been this thing"
00:25:55,00:25:59,where you have a board next to the goal.
00:25:59,00:26:01,"I think it was in Queen's Park Rangers,"
00:26:01,00:26:03,"and they scored a goal, and it hit the board,"
00:26:03,00:26:05,"and then bounced straight back out again,"
00:26:05,00:26:07,"and the goal didn't get given, because, yeah."
00:26:07,00:26:08,"- I don't understand how that,"
00:26:08,00:26:10,so it hit the board next to the--
00:26:10,00:26:11,"- So, it's gone into the net?"
00:26:11,00:26:12,"- Yeah, sorry, I didn't explain that very well."
00:26:12,00:26:14,"So, you've got the goal, the goal post,"
00:26:14,00:26:15,"and you've got the net,"
00:26:15,00:26:17,but then you've got an advertising board
00:26:17,00:26:18,right behind the goal.
00:26:18,00:26:22,"And so, the ball goes in, hits the advertising board,"
00:26:22,00:26:23,"bounces straight back out again,"
00:26:23,00:26:25,"and the referee goes, ""Well, I didn't see it go in."""
00:26:25,00:26:26,- Oh!
00:26:26,00:26:29,- And it happened quite recently
00:26:29,00:26:30,"where there was a hole in the net,"
00:26:30,00:26:32,"as in one that wasn't supposed to be there,"
00:26:32,00:26:33,a bigger than the normal hole.
00:26:33,00:26:34,(all laughing)
00:26:34,00:26:36,"And the ball went in, and it went through the hole,"
00:26:36,00:26:38,and no one could tell whether it had gone in or not.
00:26:38,00:26:39,That's good.
00:26:39,00:26:40,- That's a good thing for a goalie to do
00:26:40,00:26:42,when the action's happening up the other end.
00:26:42,00:26:42,(all laughing)
00:26:42,00:26:44,"It's like somebody's saw through the net,"
00:26:44,00:26:45,and then you'll be behind the saw.
00:26:45,00:26:47,(all laughing)
00:26:47,00:26:48,- Like Wiley Clay.
00:26:48,00:26:50,(all laughing)
00:26:50,00:26:52,"- Did you, when you were sort of part"
00:26:52,00:26:54,"of the New Zealand netball scene,"
00:26:54,00:26:59,"did you, do you know anyone who played for the Master Baiters?"
00:26:59,00:27:01,(all laughing)
00:27:01,00:27:02,Do you remember this?
00:27:02,00:27:03,- No.
00:27:03,00:27:04,- Okay. - I mean--
00:27:04,00:27:06,"- It was just a cheeky little fun New Zealand thing,"
00:27:06,00:27:09,but there was a Sydney World Masters games
00:27:09,00:27:10,"where all netball teams were coming,"
00:27:10,00:27:12,and there was a lot of New Zealand teams
00:27:12,00:27:13,"that were coming over,"
00:27:13,00:27:15,"and they named themselves the Master Baiters,"
00:27:15,00:27:16,and-- - Why?
00:27:16,00:27:18,"- Well, it was a Masters,"
00:27:18,00:27:21,"and they were baiting, so with the Master Baiters."
00:27:21,00:27:22,"- Yeah, the second baiting?"
00:27:22,00:27:24,"- Yeah, that was it. - What were they baiting?"
00:27:24,00:27:26,- Baiting the other teams.
00:27:26,00:27:28,"- Oh, I see. - Okay."
00:27:28,00:27:29,- I didn't come up with it.
00:27:29,00:27:31,(all laughing)
00:27:31,00:27:35,- I like how the sport of netball's evolved quite a lot.
00:27:35,00:27:37,"There's different versions of this fast five,"
00:27:37,00:27:40,"which is basically, they've made it more like basketball."
00:27:40,00:27:41,"There's five people on the court,"
00:27:41,00:27:43,"and there's, you can shoot three-point,"
00:27:43,00:27:45,or two-pointers and things.
00:27:45,00:27:48,The Northern Mystics used a new move
00:27:48,00:27:50,"called the Harrison Hoist,"
00:27:50,00:27:53,"because you have to be three feet away,"
00:27:53,00:27:57,"and so they had been practicing like a cheerleader lift,"
00:27:57,00:28:00,"and so she'd lifted her up,"
00:28:00,00:28:02,and she was able to bat the ball over there
00:28:02,00:28:04,as it was going into the hoop. - Is that allowed?
00:28:04,00:28:05,"- And yeah, it's allowed."
00:28:05,00:28:07,"It was in the rules of the game,"
00:28:07,00:28:08,"and they were going to go,"
00:28:08,00:28:09,"""Oh, we'll save this for the finals,"""
00:28:09,00:28:10,"but then they were like,"
00:28:10,00:28:11,"""Okay, we might not get a final,"""
00:28:11,00:28:14,so they had to do it in like a qualifying match.
00:28:14,00:28:16,"It's one of those things that they don't do all the time now,"
00:28:16,00:28:18,"because in theory, if you knew it was coming,"
00:28:18,00:28:19,"you could kind of counter it,"
00:28:19,00:28:21,"'cause you could only have two defenders in the circle,"
00:28:21,00:28:23,"so they had to use all of their resources,"
00:28:23,00:28:25,"but if you didn't see it coming,"
00:28:25,00:28:26,"you were like, ""Ah, just a shot,"""
00:28:26,00:28:29,and then suddenly she's in the sky.
00:28:29,00:28:30,"- So it's like a rugby throw-in, basically."
00:28:30,00:28:32,"- Yeah, like a line-out. - The way that, yeah,"
00:28:32,00:28:33,they lifted into the air.
00:28:33,00:28:35,"- You're not allowed to do that in football, by the way."
00:28:35,00:28:37,"- Yeah, wow. - It's in the rules,"
00:28:37,00:28:38,officially in the rules.
00:28:38,00:28:39,- Isn't it? - Yeah.
00:28:39,00:28:41,- Piggybacks. - If you--
00:28:41,00:28:42,- Fogging like a true athlete.
00:28:42,00:28:44,(all laughing)
00:28:44,00:28:47,"- It's in the air, and you wanna head the ball in,"
00:28:47,00:28:49,"and you think, ""Well, I'm gonna give my mate a piggyback."""
00:28:49,00:28:52,"It's not allowed, it's un-gentlemanly conduct,"
00:28:52,00:28:54,"it's called, it's an indirect free kick to the other team,"
00:28:54,00:28:56,and both players should be cautioned.
00:28:56,00:28:57,- Get out. - Get out.
00:28:57,00:28:58,- Wow. - That's unfair.
00:28:58,00:28:59,I think you've got the weather ball
00:28:59,00:29:01,"to put together a piggyback in that time,"
00:29:01,00:29:02,and you should be allowed to do it.
00:29:02,00:29:06,"- That was in my, 'cause I trained as a football referee,"
00:29:06,00:29:08,"and that was one of the questions that came up,"
00:29:08,00:29:10,"it's like, ""What do you do in this situation?"""
00:29:10,00:29:12,- Wow. - You give him a stern finger.
00:29:12,00:29:14,(all laughing)
00:29:14,00:29:17,"- I really wanna watch Andy's version of football, though."
00:29:17,00:29:18,(all laughing)
00:29:18,00:29:20,"It's a corner kick, he's gone for the piggyback,"
00:29:20,00:29:24,"it's gone in, oh no, someone sawed through the back of that,"
00:29:24,00:29:26,"and it has gone right through, no points."
00:29:26,00:29:29,(upbeat music)
00:29:29,00:29:34,"- Okay, it is time for fact number three, and that is Andy."
00:29:34,00:29:36,My fact is that when the asteroid
00:29:36,00:29:38,"which wiped out the dinosaurs hit,"
00:29:38,00:29:40,there was a brief burst of radiation so strong
00:29:40,00:29:44,it would have immediately cooked some dinosaurs through.
00:29:44,00:29:46,"- Whoa, like an air fryer."
00:29:46,00:29:49,"- Yes, exactly, like an air fryer."
00:29:49,00:29:52,"- This is, it's much less fun"
00:29:52,00:29:53,"than I've made it sound for the dinosaurs,"
00:29:53,00:29:55,"but what a, you know, for a brief--"
00:29:55,00:29:57,"- For like, the mammals survived, did they?"
00:29:57,00:30:00,So could they have come out and eaten some dinosaur cooked?
00:30:00,00:30:03,"- Yes, yes, they probably could, yeah."
00:30:03,00:30:04,"- But you say for a brief moment,"
00:30:04,00:30:07,so it was perfectly cooked and then they were charred
00:30:07,00:30:09,"beyond oblivion, is that it?"
00:30:09,00:30:13,"'Cause you could say, oh here is my roast for a brief moment."
00:30:13,00:30:18,"It was amazing, but it is a pile of ash now."
00:30:18,00:30:21,"- Yeah, no, you're right, you're absolutely right."
00:30:21,00:30:23,"I think a lot of, there weren't precise settings on."
00:30:23,00:30:26,This is from a fantastic book I've just read.
00:30:26,00:30:29,"It's called Not the End of the World by Hannah Ritchie,"
00:30:29,00:30:31,"and it's about completely different stuff actually,"
00:30:31,00:30:35,"it's about sustainability and the big planetary challenges,"
00:30:35,00:30:38,"but she's writing in this bit about, you know,"
00:30:38,00:30:40,extinction events and how fascinating
00:30:40,00:30:41,"some of those have been over the past,"
00:30:41,00:30:42,"and this is about the dinosaurs,"
00:30:42,00:30:44,"65 million years ago, '66?"
00:30:44,00:30:45,- '66.
00:30:45,00:30:47,"- A while ago, and the asteroid hits."
00:30:47,00:30:49,"- It was an old book that you read, wasn't it?"
00:30:49,00:30:50,"- Yeah, that's right."
00:30:50,00:30:53,(all laughing)
00:30:53,00:30:55,"- Thing hits, there's a shockwave"
00:30:55,00:30:58,"that moves 17,000 miles an hour."
00:30:58,00:31:00,It's quite hard to get your head around some of this stuff.
00:31:00,00:31:03,"And then this huge amount, like cubic miles of rock"
00:31:03,00:31:05,get lifted up by the impact.
00:31:05,00:31:08,"They then, so they've been liquidized"
00:31:08,00:31:09,"into these little glass balls,"
00:31:09,00:31:12,"which go all the way around the planet immediately,"
00:31:12,00:31:13,and then that falls.
00:31:13,00:31:15,"- It literally, the kind of sky falls down, you know."
00:31:15,00:31:16,"- Yeah, rain's glass."
00:31:16,00:31:18,"- Yeah, liquid rock, basically."
00:31:18,00:31:20,And lots of it gets blasted by friction in the atmosphere
00:31:20,00:31:22,"'cause it's coming back into the atmosphere, if you see."
00:31:22,00:31:23,- Right.
00:31:23,00:31:27,"- So then the energy is released as infrared radiation,"
00:31:27,00:31:30,which turns into this massive blast of heat.
00:31:30,00:31:31,- Thank you.
00:31:31,00:31:32,"- And if you were a dinosaur out in the open,"
00:31:32,00:31:35,"it's bad news, and it's really interesting"
00:31:35,00:31:38,'cause why didn't everything burn immediately at that point?
00:31:38,00:31:40,"And basically, there was a study in 2016"
00:31:40,00:31:42,"by a scientist called Sean Gulick,"
00:31:42,00:31:44,who found out that either it was like being in a toaster
00:31:44,00:31:47,"for a few hours, or a pizza oven for a few minutes."
00:31:47,00:31:49,It's bad news if you were out in the open.
00:31:49,00:31:50,"- Okay, wow."
00:31:50,00:31:51,- So would there be some dinosaurs
00:31:51,00:31:54,who were the furthest away that would be nicely cooked?
00:31:54,00:31:55,- Yeah.
00:31:55,00:31:56,(all laughing)
00:31:56,00:31:58,"- Medium round. - Just medium round, yes."
00:31:58,00:32:00,"- So they get cooked by the radiation,"
00:32:00,00:32:02,"the innards are just completely just, they're cooked,"
00:32:02,00:32:04,"but so they die immediately,"
00:32:04,00:32:06,or is it kind of like radiation where--
00:32:06,00:32:07,"- If you were out in the open,"
00:32:07,00:32:09,there's a very good chance you would have died at that point
00:32:09,00:32:11,'cause it's such a blast of searing heat
00:32:11,00:32:13,"for such a, for a relatively long time."
00:32:13,00:32:14,Longer than you'd be comfortable with.
00:32:14,00:32:15,- It's not just like a sauna.
00:32:15,00:32:16,"- No, it's just--"
00:32:16,00:32:18,(all laughing)
00:32:18,00:32:20,"- For a brief moment in time,"
00:32:20,00:32:21,the muscles were very relaxed.
00:32:21,00:32:24,(all laughing)
00:32:24,00:32:26,- It is nuts reading about it.
00:32:26,00:32:26,- Yeah.
00:32:26,00:32:27,"- I mean, it was pretty striking."
00:32:27,00:32:28,"- It was a big old rock, wasn't it?"
00:32:28,00:32:29,- A big old rock.
00:32:29,00:32:33,"I found one weird thing, this slide."
00:32:33,00:32:34,"Right, so I think we've said before,"
00:32:34,00:32:37,"it was the size of Mount Everest, the rock there."
00:32:37,00:32:39,And it was traveling 20 times the speed of a bullet.
00:32:39,00:32:41,"It was really, really huge."
00:32:41,00:32:42,- Big and fast.
00:32:42,00:32:43,- Big and fast.
00:32:43,00:32:47,"And it was so big and fast that when it arrived,"
00:32:47,00:32:50,it was pushing the atmosphere in front of it so rapidly
00:32:50,00:32:52,that the crater from the impact started to form
00:32:52,00:32:53,before it hit.
00:32:53,00:32:54,- Oh yeah.
00:32:54,00:32:57,- It just pushed the surface of the earth down.
00:32:57,00:32:59,"- Oh my God, it's amazing, that, isn't it?"
00:32:59,00:33:01,"- Yeah, it's insane."
00:33:01,00:33:04,"I became friends recently with the dinosaur hunter,"
00:33:04,00:33:06,"who, well, she's a paleontologist,"
00:33:06,00:33:08,who's the person who has verified
00:33:08,00:33:11,that the asteroid landed in spring.
00:33:11,00:33:13,I think you guys met her very briefly in Belgium.
00:33:13,00:33:14,- Oh yeah.
00:33:14,00:33:16,"- When we were at Nerdland, at the festival."
00:33:16,00:33:18,It was all to do with the specific fish
00:33:18,00:33:20,"that as it was being carried in the tsunamis,"
00:33:20,00:33:22,"which was not just water, it was also earth,"
00:33:22,00:33:24,like an earth tsunami.
00:33:24,00:33:28,"The glass that had come down went into,"
00:33:28,00:33:29,"through the filters of the fish,"
00:33:29,00:33:30,like went through the mouth and were inside.
00:33:30,00:33:33,"So when they found the fossilized versions of these fish,"
00:33:33,00:33:34,they found the glass.
00:33:34,00:33:36,And these specific fish are the type of fish
00:33:36,00:33:39,that have growths in their body that change per season.
00:33:39,00:33:40,"- Oh, that's so handy."
00:33:40,00:33:42,"- So during spring, yeah."
00:33:42,00:33:45,"So during spring, they grow these extra little things."
00:33:45,00:33:47,"So they spotted that and they went,"
00:33:47,00:33:48,"well, that could only happen in spring."
00:33:48,00:33:51,"Therefore, in spring on the side of the planet that it's on,"
00:33:51,00:33:52,that's where that happened.
00:33:52,00:33:53,- That is amazing.
00:33:53,00:33:53,- Really nuts.
00:33:53,00:33:54,- It is nuts.
00:33:54,00:33:55,- That's hot.
00:33:55,00:33:56,"You know, you're gonna deal with an asteroid"
00:33:56,00:33:58,and hay fever at the same time.
00:33:58,00:34:00,(all laughing)
00:34:00,00:34:04,"I was looking at extinct meat,"
00:34:04,00:34:08,'cause a cultivated meat company in Australia
00:34:08,00:34:10,made a mammoth meatball last year.
00:34:10,00:34:12,"- Oh, yes, I heard about this, yeah."
00:34:12,00:34:17,"- Using a DNA sequence from the mammoth myoglobin,"
00:34:17,00:34:19,"which is the protein that gives the meat its flavor,"
00:34:19,00:34:22,"and filled in a few gaps using elephant DNA,"
00:34:22,00:34:24,and then they made this meatball.
00:34:24,00:34:25,They did not eat the meatball.
00:34:25,00:34:26,- Really?
00:34:26,00:34:28,"- They just put it on display to be like,"
00:34:28,00:34:29,this is a mammoth meatball.
00:34:29,00:34:31,"I don't know, I think they were just,"
00:34:31,00:34:32,"they were like, we haven't really tested this,"
00:34:32,00:34:35,whether this is safe for human consumption.
00:34:35,00:34:36,"- Oh, really?"
00:34:36,00:34:37,"- So we'll just make the meatball,"
00:34:37,00:34:38,"I guess, probably to get a bit of press."
00:34:38,00:34:40,- Is it the size of a normal meatball?
00:34:40,00:34:42,"'Cause you think if it was a mammoth meatball,"
00:34:42,00:34:44,"you would deliberately make it much bigger,"
00:34:44,00:34:44,wouldn't you?
00:34:44,00:34:45,"- Yeah, exactly."
00:34:45,00:34:48,"- I didn't get, it wasn't next to like a can of Coke,"
00:34:48,00:34:49,so I'm not sure.
00:34:49,00:34:50,(laughing)
00:34:50,00:34:52,- But it loves regular meatball science.
00:34:52,00:34:55,"- Maybe you wouldn't, 'cause then it would just confuse"
00:34:55,00:34:57,"the purchaser or the person looking at it,"
00:34:57,00:34:58,"go, oh, I get it, it's mammoth, it's big."
00:34:58,00:35:00,"It's like, we're just not even considering"
00:35:00,00:35:03,the extraordinary science that has got into this.
00:35:03,00:35:05,- I would have eaten that.
00:35:05,00:35:05,- You wouldn't?
00:35:05,00:35:08,- Without knowing the health implications.
00:35:08,00:35:10,- It's interesting.
00:35:10,00:35:13,"- Okay, but I feel like they've grown it."
00:35:13,00:35:15,No animals have been harmed.
00:35:15,00:35:15,- Yeah.
00:35:15,00:35:17,"- So I'm a veggie, but I would love to."
00:35:17,00:35:19,"- Yes, I think the same thing,"
00:35:19,00:35:21,'cause my boyfriend's vegetarian and he says
00:35:21,00:35:24,that if we reached the point where we could just have
00:35:24,00:35:26,"cultivated meat made from the actual cells,"
00:35:26,00:35:28,"then he'd go, oh, it's fine, I'll eat that."
00:35:28,00:35:33,And I think it's come a long way in the last few years.
00:35:33,00:35:36,"I think the first patty they made,"
00:35:36,00:35:38,"like a mince patty, a salad just with mince patties,"
00:35:38,00:35:43,"was I think $300,000, so quite an expensive burger."
00:35:43,00:35:44,But it's come down now where they think
00:35:44,00:35:46,"that they could, you know, release these things."
00:35:46,00:35:47,"- To like 200,000."
00:35:47,00:35:48,- Yeah.
00:35:48,00:35:51,"- Release them into supermarkets, so it's rapidly."
00:35:51,00:35:52,- I experimented quite a lot with those.
00:35:52,00:35:53,"I tried some salmon the other day,"
00:35:53,00:35:55,which I have to say was not there.
00:35:55,00:35:57,"- Oh yeah, it's like the fake salmon."
00:35:57,00:35:58,- I'm saying it's not to do.
00:35:58,00:36:00,- It's not the like made from actual.
00:36:00,00:36:01,"- I'm sorry, yeah, that's fine."
00:36:01,00:36:03,- I think they just keep adding salt
00:36:03,00:36:06,until it has some kind of flavor that explains.
00:36:06,00:36:09,- I had a vegan Domino's pepperoni pizza
00:36:09,00:36:11,"a couple of nights ago, that's not an ad."
00:36:11,00:36:13,And I could not taste the difference.
00:36:13,00:36:14,- Really?
00:36:14,00:36:15,- Genuinely could not taste the difference.
00:36:15,00:36:16,"- I will just say for the listeners at home,"
00:36:16,00:36:18,he does have a Domino's tetu or something.
00:36:18,00:36:19,(all laughing)
00:36:19,00:36:20,- He's trying to show off.
00:36:20,00:36:21,"- He's wearing two watches,"
00:36:21,00:36:23,one of which seems to be a Domino's pizza.
00:36:23,00:36:24,"- Yeah, what's that?"
00:36:24,00:36:25,"Oh, pizza time."
00:36:25,00:36:27,(all laughing)
00:36:27,00:36:29,"- Can I ask, did it have cheese on it?"
00:36:29,00:36:30,"- It did, well, no, but it had vegan cheese."
00:36:30,00:36:31,- It has vegan cheese on it.
00:36:31,00:36:32,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:36:32,00:36:33,"- It's a vegan pizza, yeah."
00:36:33,00:36:35,"- They used to have a vegan pizzerics,"
00:36:35,00:36:37,"but seeing as we're talking about pizzas now,"
00:36:37,00:36:39,they used to have a vegan pizzerics best
00:36:39,00:36:39,"down the road from here,"
00:36:39,00:36:42,which only sold vegan pizzas.
00:36:42,00:36:44,And it was the most disgusting thing though.
00:36:44,00:36:47,"- The cheese, like they just couldn't do good vegan cheese."
00:36:47,00:36:48,Maybe they can now.
00:36:48,00:36:50,- It's all about the mouthfeel.
00:36:50,00:36:52,"- That's the, and the stretch."
00:36:52,00:36:53,- That's your tinder bio.
00:36:53,00:36:56,(all laughing)
00:36:56,00:36:57,"- The mouthfeeling, the stretch."
00:36:57,00:36:59,(all laughing)
00:36:59,00:37:02,- I found an essay in a scientific journal
00:37:02,00:37:04,"called Evolution, Education and Outreach,"
00:37:04,00:37:07,"and it asked, which items a Jewish time traveler"
00:37:07,00:37:09,would be able to eat because they were kosher or not?
00:37:09,00:37:10,"- Yeah, okay."
00:37:10,00:37:12,- Can you guess the headline of this article?
00:37:12,00:37:15,"- 50 points to anyone who does, is gettable."
00:37:15,00:37:17,"- Oh, is it a pun?"
00:37:17,00:37:18,Back to the juicer.
00:37:18,00:37:20,"- The juicer, that's not that."
00:37:20,00:37:20,So it's about the food.
00:37:20,00:37:23,It's about the food that you might be eating.
00:37:23,00:37:26,- Is it to do with time travel?
00:37:26,00:37:27,- It's to do with a very famous
00:37:27,00:37:29,dinosaur-based franchise.
00:37:29,00:37:30,(all laughing)
00:37:30,00:37:31,- Jurassic pork.
00:37:31,00:37:32,- Jurassic pork.
00:37:32,00:37:33,(all exclaiming)
00:37:33,00:37:34,- Beautiful.
00:37:34,00:37:35,- Jurassic pork.
00:37:35,00:37:36,- Beautiful.
00:37:36,00:37:38,"- And it was, that's a good headline."
00:37:38,00:37:39,"- Yeah, that's good."
00:37:39,00:37:42,- And it was about what basically a Jewish time traveler
00:37:42,00:37:43,who wanted to eat contemporaneous food
00:37:43,00:37:44,would be allowed to eat.
00:37:44,00:37:46,"And basically very few dinosaurs are kosher,"
00:37:46,00:37:47,it turns out.
00:37:47,00:37:48,"- Oh, wow."
00:37:48,00:37:49,- Some of them are birds.
00:37:49,00:37:52,But even the bird ones lack the sort of toe
00:37:52,00:37:54,"that you have to, if you're allowed to eat"
00:37:54,00:37:55,"particular meats that are kosher,"
00:37:55,00:37:57,it's 'cause they're like chicken.
00:37:57,00:37:59,"They've got a particular opposable toe, I think."
00:37:59,00:38:00,- Right.
00:38:00,00:38:01,- Mice are not allowed.
00:38:01,00:38:03,That's probably not relevant now.
00:38:03,00:38:05,"- So sorry, Jew-rasic pork."
00:38:05,00:38:06,- They actually just went with Jurassic.
00:38:06,00:38:08,- They just went with Jurassic?
00:38:08,00:38:09,- Yeah.
00:38:09,00:38:10,"- What, Jew-rasic pork?"
00:38:10,00:38:12,- I think they were correct in that.
00:38:12,00:38:15,I think Jurassic pork is...
00:38:15,00:38:17,- It's sitting there.
00:38:17,00:38:18,"- Yeah, I guess so."
00:38:18,00:38:19,- It's like a complaints letter.
00:38:19,00:38:21,(laughing)
00:38:21,00:38:24,"- We said earlier, 65, 66 million years ago"
00:38:24,00:38:26,with the extinction of the dinosaurs.
00:38:26,00:38:27,- Sure.
00:38:27,00:38:31,- But do you know how long ago that is in a galactic year?
00:38:31,00:38:32,- Ooh.
00:38:32,00:38:34,- I'd never heard of a galactic year before.
00:38:34,00:38:37,- There must be something to do with the traveling
00:38:37,00:38:37,through the galaxy.
00:38:37,00:38:40,"- Yeah, so how long it takes the galaxy to go on once?"
00:38:40,00:38:41,- Exactly.
00:38:41,00:38:42,- I think it's three years ago in galaxy years.
00:38:42,00:38:46,"- Galactic year is 225 million years, roughly."
00:38:46,00:38:47,- Sort of 10.
00:38:47,00:38:48,- Yeah.
00:38:48,00:38:49,- Incorrect.
00:38:49,00:38:50,- Really?
00:38:50,00:38:52,- So the dinosaurs were here 3.5 months ago.
00:38:52,00:38:53,- Oh wow.
00:38:53,00:38:54,- In a galactic year.
00:38:54,00:38:56,"- The dinosaurs were on Earth,"
00:38:56,00:38:58,"but if you had a time machine,"
00:38:58,00:39:00,"like, you know what does Doctor Who have?"
00:39:00,00:39:02,"It's like a TARDIS, yeah."
00:39:02,00:39:04,You go into the TARDIS
00:39:04,00:39:07,"and you come back exactly in the same position in space,"
00:39:07,00:39:10,"but different time, the Earth won't be here anymore."
00:39:10,00:39:11,"- Yeah, we'll be further in space."
00:39:11,00:39:12,- Yeah.
00:39:12,00:39:13,"- Yeah, so you have to-"
00:39:13,00:39:15,- And if Doctor Who was going through-
00:39:15,00:39:17,(laughing)
00:39:17,00:39:19,"- Sorry, I was just trying to appeal."
00:39:19,00:39:21,(laughing)
00:39:21,00:39:22,- Oh my goodness.
00:39:22,00:39:23,- Yeah.
00:39:23,00:39:26,(upbeat music)
00:39:26,00:39:31,"- Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show."
00:39:31,00:39:32,And that is my fact.
00:39:32,00:39:34,"My fact this week is that in the 1980s,"
00:39:34,00:39:38,you could download video games over the radio.
00:39:38,00:39:38,- Okay.
00:39:38,00:39:39,- What?
00:39:39,00:39:40,- Yeah.
00:39:40,00:39:41,- What?
00:39:41,00:39:42,"- To a certain generation, that's gonna be like,"
00:39:42,00:39:44,there used to be a thing called MySpace.
00:39:44,00:39:45,- Yeah.
00:39:45,00:39:46,(laughing)
00:39:46,00:39:47,- Have you heard of DVDs?
00:39:47,00:39:49,- I was alive in the 1980s and I never heard that.
00:39:49,00:39:51,"- Yeah, no, I didn't think of this either."
00:39:51,00:39:53,This was the very early days of computers
00:39:53,00:39:56,whereby hard drives were incredibly expensive.
00:39:56,00:39:58,"So they used to have an audio cassette,"
00:39:58,00:39:59,like you would in a stereo.
00:39:59,00:40:00,You could put a cassette in
00:40:00,00:40:02,and that's where you would keep all the data
00:40:02,00:40:04,of programs that you were loading up.
00:40:04,00:40:07,"So someone made the connection that actually,"
00:40:07,00:40:09,"if you're able to record onto a cassette,"
00:40:09,00:40:10,you should be able to transfer
00:40:10,00:40:13,multiple different kinds of data over the radio.
00:40:13,00:40:15,And why not video games?
00:40:15,00:40:17,So what people used to do is they used to tune in
00:40:17,00:40:22,to radio shows that basically just played data over the waves.
00:40:22,00:40:24,You'd put your cassette in and you would press record
00:40:24,00:40:26,"and then you take it out, put it in your computer"
00:40:26,00:40:26,and there's your video game.
00:40:26,00:40:28,- So these were dedicated radio stations
00:40:28,00:40:30,"and wasn't like, that was talking here."
00:40:30,00:40:32,(laughing)
00:40:32,00:40:33,- It was now time for Tetris.
00:40:33,00:40:38,So what did the audio sound like?
00:40:38,00:40:41,"- Well, for people probably older than you,"
00:40:41,00:40:43,"but younger than me, it would sound like,"
00:40:43,00:40:46,"you know, when you had dial-up internet"
00:40:46,00:40:49,"and a fax came through on a phone line,"
00:40:49,00:40:50,it's just like...
00:40:50,00:40:53,"Yeah, it's exactly that."
00:40:53,00:40:55,- And the computer just takes that
00:40:55,00:40:57,"and if it's a high sound, it's a one"
00:40:57,00:40:58,"and if it's a low sound, it's a zero"
00:40:58,00:41:00,and it just turns it into zeros and ones
00:41:00,00:41:01,and makes games out of it.
00:41:01,00:41:03,"- Yeah, and to be fair, that could be confused"
00:41:03,00:41:05,as a very popular type of...
00:41:05,00:41:06,"- Yes, exactly."
00:41:06,00:41:07,- Techno.
00:41:07,00:41:09,(laughing)
00:41:09,00:41:11,"Yeah, so this was done for ages"
00:41:11,00:41:14,"and then suddenly, obviously modern technology"
00:41:14,00:41:15,"and prices, you know, the equivalent"
00:41:15,00:41:18,"of the Mammoth Berger coming down from 300,000,"
00:41:18,00:41:21,they suddenly were able to afford to have hard drives
00:41:21,00:41:23,and computers and so it slowly got wiped out.
00:41:23,00:41:25,"But yeah, that was the thing that happened."
00:41:25,00:41:30,"It's bizarre to think that you could take a video game,"
00:41:30,00:41:32,"Grand Theft Auto, by just listening to the radio"
00:41:32,00:41:34,and recording it.
00:41:34,00:41:36,I'm not used to the idea that data could be transmitted
00:41:36,00:41:38,in ways that we can hear and understand.
00:41:38,00:41:41,"- It's so strong, yes, yeah."
00:41:41,00:41:42,- And obviously data could be transmitted
00:41:42,00:41:43,in ways we can hear and understand
00:41:43,00:41:47,'cause I'm talking to you all as I understand.
00:41:47,00:41:49,"But yeah, yeah, and there was weird things"
00:41:49,00:41:53,"that were done using this kind of novelty, I guess it was,"
00:41:53,00:41:54,"Radio West, do you ever hear of Radio West?"
00:41:54,00:41:56,I think it's BBC and they just called it Radio West.
00:41:56,00:41:58,So it's sort of you get your local BBC in an area.
00:41:58,00:42:01,"There used to be a host who was called,"
00:42:01,00:42:04,"ooh, what was he called?"
00:42:04,00:42:06,"Sorry, hang on a sec."
00:42:06,00:42:07,"There used to be a host called Joe Tozzer,"
00:42:07,00:42:09,who used to work for--
00:42:09,00:42:10,(laughing)
00:42:10,00:42:11,- How did you forget that name?
00:42:11,00:42:13,(laughing)
00:42:13,00:42:14,"- And then at number six this week,"
00:42:14,00:42:16,Joe Tozzer and the master-paters.
00:42:16,00:42:18,(laughing)
00:42:18,00:42:21,- So funny.
00:42:21,00:42:23,(laughing)
00:42:23,00:42:27,"- Sorry, Joe, if you're listening."
00:42:27,00:42:29,"But also, how was school?"
00:42:29,00:42:31,"Was that, that was a rough one."
00:42:31,00:42:32,- How do you spell it?
00:42:32,00:42:33,- It could be Tozzer.
00:42:33,00:42:34,"- Tozzer, yeah."
00:42:34,00:42:35,- I'm sure he says Tozzer.
00:42:35,00:42:38,"- I was in ""Fade Tozzer"" from Steps."
00:42:38,00:42:38,- Okay.
00:42:38,00:42:39,"- We're a piece of good together,"
00:42:39,00:42:40,it was definitely a different name for that.
00:42:40,00:42:41,- Tozzer.
00:42:41,00:42:42,"- Yeah, he are."
00:42:42,00:42:43,"- Oh yeah, Tozzer."
00:42:43,00:42:44,- You said he went with Tozzer.
00:42:44,00:42:46,(laughing)
00:42:46,00:42:49,"- Sorry, Joe."
00:42:49,00:42:54,"- But yeah, so he once broadcast the data sounds"
00:42:54,00:42:56,of what ended up being a pixel image
00:42:56,00:42:58,of one of Charlie's Angels Angels.
00:42:58,00:42:59,So the star Sheryl Land.
00:42:59,00:43:01,"So you recorded it down, put it into your computer"
00:43:01,00:43:04,"and slowly it pixelated together,"
00:43:04,00:43:07,40 by 80 pixels of the star.
00:43:07,00:43:08,- 40 by 80.
00:43:08,00:43:09,- 40 by 80.
00:43:09,00:43:10,"- It's actually resolution, it is."
00:43:10,00:43:11,- Is that a boob or a head?
00:43:11,00:43:14,(laughing)
00:43:14,00:43:20,- And of course you could do it with vinyl as well.
00:43:20,00:43:23,And there was some computer game magazines
00:43:23,00:43:24,that would put little vinyls
00:43:24,00:43:26,on front of the magazine.
00:43:26,00:43:29,And it would just play this noise
00:43:29,00:43:32,which your computer then would recognize as zeros and ones
00:43:32,00:43:35,and would turn into a game.
00:43:35,00:43:36,It's all 'cause you didn't have enough memory
00:43:36,00:43:37,on your computer.
00:43:37,00:43:38,"- It's exactly that, yeah."
00:43:38,00:43:40,- So your memory had to be on your cassette.
00:43:40,00:43:41,- Yeah.
00:43:41,00:43:42,- What are the limitations of it now?
00:43:42,00:43:47,"So in theory, could we do it for a more complex game"
00:43:47,00:43:49,than Tetris or Pong or--
00:43:49,00:43:51,"- You could for sure, I reckon."
00:43:51,00:43:51,"But the problem is,"
00:43:51,00:43:53,'cause I used to have one of these computers
00:43:53,00:43:54,"with the cassettes on,"
00:43:54,00:43:56,it would take about 30 minutes
00:43:56,00:43:58,to load any game onto your computer.
00:43:58,00:44:01,And they were all really shit games.
00:44:01,00:44:04,"They were fun, but the graphics were terrible and whatever."
00:44:04,00:44:07,And often you would get to the end of the 30 minutes
00:44:07,00:44:10,and one of its zeros or ones would have been read wrong
00:44:10,00:44:11,and the whole thing would be knackered.
00:44:11,00:44:13,You'd have to start again.
00:44:13,00:44:16,And so if you wanted to put like Grand Theft Auto
00:44:16,00:44:19,"on today, you'd probably have to make it play"
00:44:19,00:44:20,for about 40 years.
00:44:20,00:44:21,"- Yeah, okay, all right."
00:44:21,00:44:22,- That would be great to know
00:44:22,00:44:23,'cause the game is so massive.
00:44:23,00:44:24,"You're a gamer, aren't you?"
00:44:24,00:44:27,"- I'm a little bit of a gamer, yes."
00:44:27,00:44:31,Can we get Baldur's Gate 3 in audio form?
00:44:31,00:44:34,- They did end up releasing very specific audio blank cassettes
00:44:34,00:44:36,that you could get called basic code.
00:44:36,00:44:40,So it would guarantee compatibility with your computer
00:44:40,00:44:43,as opposed to I imagine there were a few audio cassettes
00:44:43,00:44:45,out there that didn't quite do it.
00:44:45,00:44:47,"And so, yeah, you would tune into either like DataRama"
00:44:47,00:44:50,"or HobbyScoop, which were specific radio stations"
00:44:50,00:44:51,that-- - That's amazing.
00:44:51,00:44:54,- But you can just put on Radio 4
00:44:54,00:44:55,and listen to the shipping forecast
00:44:55,00:44:56,and make that into your own game.
00:44:56,00:44:58,"I find, you know."
00:44:58,00:45:01,"- We used to do this as kids, actually."
00:45:01,00:45:04,And we would have to guess whether it was rising slowly
00:45:04,00:45:05,"or, you know, I don't know if it's the pressure"
00:45:05,00:45:10,"or something, they go, ""Dogger 75, rising slowly."""
00:45:10,00:45:11,We had to guess what it was gonna be.
00:45:11,00:45:12,- That's good.
00:45:12,00:45:14,Who's the host of the shipping forecast?
00:45:14,00:45:16,- I don't think it's got a host per se.
00:45:16,00:45:17,"- Well, the person who reads--"
00:45:17,00:45:18,- I don't know.
00:45:18,00:45:19,- I can't remember.
00:45:19,00:45:20,I think it's been the same person for about 40 years.
00:45:20,00:45:21,- She's very famous.
00:45:21,00:45:23,"Yeah, she's married, I think, to Claire Bolding."
00:45:23,00:45:26,"She, I was on a show with her once"
00:45:26,00:45:29,"and I was asked, ""Do you wanna have any questions for her"
00:45:29,00:45:31,"""about the shipping forecast?"""
00:45:31,00:45:33,I didn't know what to ask 'cause I'd never heard it.
00:45:33,00:45:36,"So I said, ""What's your favorite ship?"""
00:45:36,00:45:38,(laughing)
00:45:38,00:45:40,That's a good question.
00:45:40,00:45:41,- It's a good question.
00:45:41,00:45:42,Did she have an answer?
00:45:42,00:45:45,"- No, she was like, ""You haven't heard my show, have you?"""
00:45:45,00:45:47,"I said, ""No, I haven't, food."""
00:45:47,00:45:49,"- And she said, ""What's your favorite fish?"""
00:45:49,00:45:50,- Yeah.
00:45:50,00:45:53,- Did you hear of the game Great Britain Limited?
00:45:53,00:45:55,I was looking at some early spectrum games.
00:45:55,00:45:56,- No.
00:45:56,00:45:58,"- In Great Britain Limited,"
00:45:58,00:46:00,it was a government simulation
00:46:00,00:46:04,where you managed the British economy and--
00:46:04,00:46:05,- I love it.
00:46:05,00:46:06,- Wow.
00:46:06,00:46:07,- There's no way to win.
00:46:07,00:46:09,- It was very--
00:46:09,00:46:10,- Did they give Lys Trassa a go there?
00:46:10,00:46:12,(laughing)
00:46:12,00:46:13,- This was easy.
00:46:13,00:46:16,(laughing)
00:46:16,00:46:18,"- Yeah, you would like change little things"
00:46:18,00:46:19,and then the inflation would go up
00:46:19,00:46:22,or the unemployment would go down or vice versa.
00:46:22,00:46:24,And then every five years you would have an election
00:46:24,00:46:26,"and depending on how well you've done,"
00:46:26,00:46:28,it would say you've been kicked out
00:46:28,00:46:30,or you've got another five years.
00:46:30,00:46:32,"- Wow, that is so funny."
00:46:32,00:46:33,That's really good.
00:46:33,00:46:34,What was that?
00:46:34,00:46:36,"- '80s, yeah, early '80s."
00:46:36,00:46:37,"- Wow, and it was government-made?"
00:46:37,00:46:38,"- No, it was just--"
00:46:38,00:46:39,"- Oh, okay."
00:46:39,00:46:40,"- A lot of these games in the '80s,"
00:46:40,00:46:43,they were just made by kids in the bedrooms.
00:46:43,00:46:45,"- Yeah, which was mad."
00:46:45,00:46:48,I went over to the home of a rider friend of my other friends
00:46:48,00:46:50,"and she was like, ""I want you to meet him."
00:46:50,00:46:50,"""He's really cool."""
00:46:50,00:46:53,We went over and he just pulled out a whole archive
00:46:53,00:46:55,of cassettes of games he invented.
00:46:55,00:46:56,- Wow.
00:46:56,00:46:58,"- Yeah, and that was the first time I ever learned"
00:46:58,00:47:00,that games could be put on an audio cassette.
00:47:00,00:47:02,"- It was a good time for creativity,"
00:47:02,00:47:04,but just in a very shitty medium.
00:47:04,00:47:06,(laughing)
00:47:06,00:47:08,- Much like the podcast.
00:47:08,00:47:10,(laughing)
00:47:10,00:47:13,"Do you have any really weird games, Mel?"
00:47:13,00:47:15,- Do I have any weird games at one point?
00:47:15,00:47:17,'Cause I have quite an addictive personality
00:47:17,00:47:18,when it comes to games.
00:47:18,00:47:22,There is a very stupid game on Steam called Cookie Clicker.
00:47:22,00:47:25,And it's literally a cookie and you just click it
00:47:25,00:47:26,and you get another cookie.
00:47:26,00:47:30,But then you keep clicking and then you can buy
00:47:30,00:47:33,like a cafe that makes cookies.
00:47:33,00:47:35,"So you just, it's basic."
00:47:35,00:47:37,I feel like it feeds the endorphins in your brain
00:47:37,00:47:39,because you just like keep clicking
00:47:39,00:47:41,and then you can buy like an automatic clicker
00:47:41,00:47:43,with the cookies and then it will automatically
00:47:43,00:47:44,click it for you.
00:47:44,00:47:47,And then you can buy a factory of cookies.
00:47:47,00:47:48,"And you keep, and it's-"
00:47:48,00:47:49,- But you have to keep clicking.
00:47:49,00:47:52,- But you could leave it for like an hour
00:47:52,00:47:54,because you've run an automated system.
00:47:54,00:47:55,"And then you come back and you're like,"
00:47:55,00:47:57,I've got four billion cookies.
00:47:57,00:48:00,And it just feeds the endorphins in your brain
00:48:00,00:48:01,"because you're like, I'm doing,"
00:48:01,00:48:03,I'm getting better at this game.
00:48:03,00:48:04,- Do you say it's on Steam?
00:48:04,00:48:05,"- It's on Steam, a lot of that."
00:48:05,00:48:06,- What is Steam?
00:48:06,00:48:07,- Steam is just-
00:48:07,00:48:09,"- Oh, that's so embarrassing."
00:48:09,00:48:12,But just for the other people who don't know what it is.
00:48:12,00:48:14,- It's for those idiots listening at home.
00:48:14,00:48:18,"- No, just kidding. Steam is just a game library, essentially."
00:48:18,00:48:20,"So it's, if you're on a PC, you can download games"
00:48:20,00:48:23,"and almost all games, unless they're like console exclusive"
00:48:23,00:48:25,will be on Steam that you can download.
00:48:25,00:48:26,- And a console?
00:48:26,00:48:28,(laughing)
00:48:28,00:48:31,- Are you taking you guys out gamers?
00:48:31,00:48:32,- I've actually lost Steam.
00:48:32,00:48:33,- You have got Steam.
00:48:33,00:48:33,- Do you?
00:48:33,00:48:34,- What games do you play?
00:48:34,00:48:36,- Don't play many games on it.
00:48:36,00:48:36,"- No, really?"
00:48:36,00:48:37,"- I play Fortnite, all right?"
00:48:37,00:48:38,I play Fortnite against eight year olds
00:48:38,00:48:40,"around the world, I'm a lose."
00:48:40,00:48:43,- I tried Fortnite and I was just too embarrassed
00:48:43,00:48:46,"to continue, 'cause the skill cap of that game is so high"
00:48:46,00:48:48,and these 14 year olds that have been playing
00:48:48,00:48:51,since they were nine are just so good
00:48:51,00:48:53,that you couldn't possibly just start a game now
00:48:53,00:48:56,and be anywhere near as good as them.
00:48:56,00:48:58,"So it's just, you know?"
00:48:58,00:49:01,- If I put myself in the mind of a 14 year old
00:49:01,00:49:03,"playing this game, would it be immediately obvious"
00:49:03,00:49:04,which one Andy was?
00:49:04,00:49:06,"- Oh yeah, yeah, I think so."
00:49:06,00:49:07,"- I'm the guy hiding in one of the buildings,"
00:49:07,00:49:09,just trying to have a nice afternoon.
00:49:09,00:49:12,"There's a cookie, I'm trying to click on that."
00:49:12,00:49:13,- Yeah.
00:49:13,00:49:15,- He's soaring out the bed from a minute.
00:49:15,00:49:18,(laughing)
00:49:18,00:49:19,- Trying to escape.
00:49:19,00:49:23,- Here's a fact about the guy who invented
00:49:23,00:49:25,"video games, arguably, and it's sent in by,"
00:49:25,00:49:28,"listen to this, it's sent in by Grant Wyn Jones,"
00:49:28,00:49:30,who's sent in the fact that nuclear bombs
00:49:30,00:49:32,and video games were created by the same guy.
00:49:32,00:49:35,"- Yeah, that's actually a deleted scene from"
00:49:35,00:49:36,Oppenheimer. - Oppenheimer.
00:49:36,00:49:38,(laughing)
00:49:38,00:49:39,"- Well, it's not Oppenheimer,"
00:49:39,00:49:41,"but it's a guy called William Higginbotham,"
00:49:41,00:49:45,"great name, who did invent the first screen-based"
00:49:45,00:49:48,"video game, it was called Tennis for Two,"
00:49:48,00:49:50,and it was in 1958.
00:49:50,00:49:51,"- Sounds like Pong, right?"
00:49:51,00:49:55,"- It's pretty Pong-y, it's like 2D tennis."
00:49:55,00:49:57,"There was nothing to play it on,"
00:49:57,00:49:59,"so you had to play it on an oscilloscope,"
00:49:59,00:50:01,"which is a device to measure voltage waves,"
00:50:01,00:50:04,"and that, because there were no consoles,"
00:50:04,00:50:06,"no screens, no, nothing."
00:50:06,00:50:08,"And he also worked on the Manhattan Project,"
00:50:08,00:50:09,and he was in charge of the team
00:50:09,00:50:11,which made the electronic triggers
00:50:11,00:50:13,for the first nuclear bombs.
00:50:13,00:50:16,"So, that's the fact, it stacks up."
00:50:16,00:50:17,- That's great. - And he played
00:50:17,00:50:18,the accordion as well.
00:50:18,00:50:20,And his daughter wrote a memoir about him
00:50:20,00:50:23,"called Accordion to Willy, which is..."
00:50:23,00:50:26,(laughing)
00:50:26,00:50:27,- While we're talking about sort of like
00:50:27,00:50:30,"the founding figures of video gaming,"
00:50:30,00:50:32,one person who's known as the father
00:50:32,00:50:34,"of the video games industry,"
00:50:34,00:50:36,and I believe this is the person who kind of took it away
00:50:36,00:50:37,"from PC and said, the television,"
00:50:37,00:50:39,"why are we not getting it on the television,"
00:50:39,00:50:41,"was an engineer and inventor,"
00:50:41,00:50:45,and his name was Ralph Baer.
00:50:45,00:50:47,"- Oh, spelled the same as Clara."
00:50:47,00:50:50,"- Yes, and a translation that they are..."
00:50:50,00:50:54,"No, they're not, I couldn't find any relation."
00:50:54,00:50:57,"I was so excited when I saw the connection, name, but no."
00:50:57,00:50:59,"- That's so funny. - Nothing, yeah."
00:50:59,00:51:01,- Last game that I played to any regularity
00:51:01,00:51:04,"was Mario Kart, N64. - Oh yeah."
00:51:04,00:51:06,- And there's a really nice economic theory
00:51:06,00:51:09,that the world should be like Mario Kart.
00:51:09,00:51:11,"- Okay, they're all like,"
00:51:11,00:51:13,I can kind of see what you mean.
00:51:13,00:51:13,- Oh really? - Yeah.
00:51:13,00:51:16,"If you're in the front in a game of Mario Kart,"
00:51:16,00:51:18,your power-ups are less powerful.
00:51:18,00:51:20,"So if you're first, you will get like,"
00:51:20,00:51:23,"maybe a banana peel to throw behind you, which, yeah."
00:51:23,00:51:25,"But then if you're last, you will get a power-up"
00:51:25,00:51:27,that's like turns you on a torpedo.
00:51:27,00:51:29,"- A giant bullet guy, yeah. - Yeah, a giant bullet guy"
00:51:29,00:51:32,"that can go to the top, or the blue shell,"
00:51:32,00:51:35,which automatically wipes out the person in first.
00:51:35,00:51:38,So I guess in the sense that it kind of
00:51:38,00:51:40,evens things out in society a little more.
00:51:40,00:51:42,"- Exactly, it's like Reverse Iron Rand, basically."
00:51:42,00:51:44,And it's known as rubberbanding.
00:51:44,00:51:47,And the idea is that anyone at the back of society
00:51:47,00:51:50,"gets a huge boost, and it helps everyone in society,"
00:51:50,00:51:51,especially as those people at the bottom
00:51:51,00:51:54,tend to be like farmers or people who are helping
00:51:54,00:51:57,at the base of everything.
00:51:57,00:51:58,"And apparently that would be a great way of doing it,"
00:51:58,00:52:01,apart from good luck finding anyone to vote for it.
00:52:01,00:52:02,(all laughing)
00:52:02,00:52:03,- That's really interesting.
00:52:03,00:52:06,"- That's a lovely idea. - I like that theory, yeah."
00:52:06,00:52:10,"- In 2004, someone made a device that is a Game Boy,"
00:52:10,00:52:13,and the Game Boy is also attached to kind of a thing
00:52:13,00:52:16,"that goes over your mouth, which gives you nitrous oxide"
00:52:16,00:52:19,and basically makes you pass out.
00:52:19,00:52:22,And this was for children. - What was the function of?
00:52:22,00:52:24,- To stop them playing?
00:52:24,00:52:25,"- No, no, not to stop them playing."
00:52:25,00:52:26,"- But as in you have enough nitrous oxide,"
00:52:26,00:52:28,"you do well enough at the game, you pass out,"
00:52:28,00:52:29,you stop playing the Game Boy?
00:52:29,00:52:30,"- No, it's not that."
00:52:30,00:52:32,Any other thoughts why you might do this?
00:52:32,00:52:33,It's for children.
00:52:33,00:52:36,- It's for children. - For children to pass out.
00:52:36,00:52:39,- So if they're going into surgery and they need to--
00:52:39,00:52:41,- Oh! - Oh my gosh!
00:52:41,00:52:42,"- Got it in one damn, yeah."
00:52:42,00:52:45,So the idea is it's hard to give kids anesthesia
00:52:45,00:52:47,and keep them calm while you're doing it.
00:52:47,00:52:49,"If you give them a Game Boy to play,"
00:52:49,00:52:52,then they're distracted and they get the anesthesia.
00:52:52,00:52:54,"And it was designed, but never--"
00:52:54,00:52:56,- Never used. - Never used.
00:52:56,00:52:58,"- Well, it's unfair on children who are not good at video,"
00:52:58,00:52:59,like I'm not very good at video games.
00:52:59,00:53:01,So I would still be on lying there.
00:53:01,00:53:04,"- Now it's later, the surgeon's ready to go home."
00:53:04,00:53:06,I might as well--
00:53:06,00:53:09,"- It's just the tutorial, come on!"
00:53:09,00:53:11,(laughing)
00:53:11,00:53:18,"- Okay, that's it."
