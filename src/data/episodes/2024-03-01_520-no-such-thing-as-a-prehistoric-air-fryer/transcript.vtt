00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.260
 (upbeat music)

00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:04.040
 Hi everyone, welcome to this week's episode

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:06.160
 of No Such Thing as a Fish.

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:09.720
 Anna Tyshinski is still off on her hollybabs.

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:13.960
 And so we have for you a very, very special guest.

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:16.820
 It is Melanie Bracewell.

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:19.640
 Now those of you down under will know who Melanie is.

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:24.040
 She is a regular on television in Australia and New Zealand.

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:26.880
 She's recently been on New Zealand Taskmaster.

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.160
 If anyone outside of New Zealand has naughtily managed

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:32.560
 to get hold of that on the tubes.

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:34.720
 (laughs)

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:36.560
 You'll know her from that.

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:39.000
 But we've actually known Mel for many, many years.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
 We first met her when we did our New Zealand tour

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.280
 many years ago.

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:45.000
 We've been wanting to get her on the podcast

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.120
 for ages and ages.

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:49.920
 And finally she is in the UK and she came on the show.

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.880
 And actually that brings me to the fact

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:54.440
 that she is touring the UK at the moment.

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:57.840
 So if you listen to this podcast, you like what you hear.

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.680
 I know you will 'cause she's absolutely brilliant.

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:00.800
 She's so funny.

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.000
 Then definitely get down to one of her gigs.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.220
 You'll have to get in there fast

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:07.480
 because she is already right in the middle of that tour.

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:09.400
 But if you listen to this as soon as it comes out

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:11.160
 then you just about have enough time

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:13.440
 to get to her gigs in Stafford, Edinburgh,

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:16.180
 Glasgow, London, Cambridge and Birmingham.

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:18.400
 That's all happening in the next week or so.

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:21.880
 And of course if you are in Australia or New Zealand

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:23.920
 then she's doing loads of gigs down there.

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:25.640
 And actually in the UK she'll be back

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:28.480
 to do the Edinburgh Festival in the summer.

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:30.480
 So if you want to know any more about Melanie

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:32.640

 then go to melaniebracewell.com/gigs.

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.260
 Really hope you enjoy the show.

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.000
 I'm absolutely certain you will.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.020
 So let's just say on with the podcast.

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:47.600
 (upbeat music)

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:53.680
 (upbeat music)

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:56.900
 (upbeat music)

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:07.080
 - Hello and welcome to another episode

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:09.720
 of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.440
 coming to you from the QI offices in Hoburn.

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:13.560
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.760
 I am sitting here with Andrew Hunter Murray,

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.400
 James Harkin and Melanie Bracewell.

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.600
 And once again we have gathered round the microphones

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:23.120
 with our four favourite facts from the last seven days

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:26.040
 and in no particular order, here we go.

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.000
 Starting with fact number one, that is Mel.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.440
 - Yes, my fact this week is that a study of magpies

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:36.680
 in Australia has revealed that magpies

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:38.320
 do not like to be studied.

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:42.080
 So this was a study that they did

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:44.440
 at the University of the Sunshine Coast.

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:46.120
 They were trying to track flight patterns

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:47.240
 and things of magpies.

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:48.800
 They developed these very special trackers

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:51.280
 that are only 1% of a magpies body weight.

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:54.320
 This is perfect and they put these trackers on the birds

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:56.520
 and they quickly just started pecking them away

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:58.320
 and they went, oh, they're not being very successful.

00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:59.160
 It'll be okay.

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.680
 And then the other magpies came

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:05.720
 and just helped them peck the trackers off of them.

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:08.280
 So at first they were sort of, you know,

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:10.120
 you scratch my back, I'll scratch yours

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:11.600
 and they were pecking them off each other.

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:13.200
 But then they found that other magpies

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:15.560
 who didn't even have a tracker in the first place

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:18.800
 were helping the other magpies to get rid of their trackers.

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:21.920
 So they were showing behaviors of like ultrism.

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:23.000
 And so they were like, actually,

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.560
 this is quite a good study.

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:25.920
 - Oh, so that's how they know.

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:28.840
 I was hoping they'd decoded like some calls of theirs

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:31.680
 and they would translate this piece off, mate.

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:32.520
 - Probably, yeah.

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:35.040
 - Actually, you know, 1% of your body weight

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:36.360
 would be almost a kilo.

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:37.360
 - What are my clothes?

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:38.280
 What are my clothes weigh?

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:39.840
 I don't know.

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:41.680
 - Let's weigh your clothes now.

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:43.960
 - No, let's not take them all off now and weigh them.

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:46.280
 (laughing)

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:47.600
 - But you do have a good point

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:50.880
 because magpies do have a reputation for being dicks.

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:53.080
 They, but falsely.

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:57.520
 So basically only eight to 10% of magpies will swoop people.

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:01.200
 Only the male magpies and only in one month of the year.

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:02.440
 - Hashtag not all magpies.

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:03.440
 - Yeah, exactly.

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:04.600
 - Well, this is a really interesting thing

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:07.520
 because magpies are over on this side of the planet as well.

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:09.000
 But Aussie magpies,

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.400
 they're actually a different species to the European magpie.

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:14.240
 That's just not anything to do with each other.

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:15.480
 So I remember saying to people,

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:18.160
 oh, magpie swoop and that being an alien concept here,

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:19.120
 but you live in Australia.

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:22.520
 You know the danger, the fear of walking down a street

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:24.360
 and a magpie swooping on you.

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:26.400
 - And the problem is, because they're very smart

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:28.040
 and they recognize faces,

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:30.240
 if they decide that they don't like you,

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:31.880
 they will target you.

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:34.680
 So some people will just get swooped every day

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:36.200
 on their way to work.

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:38.160
 And so that's why they've earned that reputation.

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:39.000
 - Have you been swooped?

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.800
 - I have been swooped once in my life,

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:42.760
 but my boyfriend loves birds a lot.

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:45.040
 And he has decided when we first moved to Australia,

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:48.600
 he was gonna become friends with all the magpies.

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:49.640
 So that's the other thing,

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:51.160
 because they can recognize your face,

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:53.680
 you can actually make a friend for life.

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:55.080
 And they stay in the same neighborhood.

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:56.440
 So if you move into a neighborhood

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:57.760
 and there are magpies there,

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:00.600
 they will be the same magpies for like 20 years.

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:03.160
 - See, it's really high stakes when you move in.

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:05.520
 You've got a chance to make a good impression.

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:07.720
 And if you blow it, long-term grudges are held.

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:10.000
 - I know you mean, but they only usually live

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:11.240
 for about five years.

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:14.080
 - Can't the family, like in the mafia,

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:16.560
 remember and bear a grudge?

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:18.200
 Didn't we save, I mean, that was crows,

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:19.400
 we were talking about ages and ages ago,

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:20.720
 I think crows, bear a grudge.

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:21.880
 - They do, yes.

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:25.360
 And the school children are often targeted by magpies

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:27.560
 because they often wear school uniforms.

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:30.960
 So if one child has thrown a rock at a magpie,

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:33.720
 they will then view all children as threats.

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:35.560
 And so they'll just attack.

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:37.600
 Same with like if they determine

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:39.520
 if you're wearing like something covering your face

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:41.840
 or your head, say a bicelmet.

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:43.160
 They view that as a threat of like,

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:45.160
 what are you hiding from?

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:47.720
 And then they will then swoop you for that.

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:49.760
 - Does anyone come across Emma Glenfield

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:50.880
 when you're doing this research?

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:51.720
 - No.

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:53.040
 - So we were talking about school kids.

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:56.480
 She was in Australia and she'd been watching people

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:58.480
 be swooped by these magpies.

00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:01.360
 And she thought, it seems to me like they're going

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:03.960
 for bold people more, the bold teachers,

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:06.040
 they seem to be going for the bold teachers.

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:07.840
 And she asked her mom, is this a thing?

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:09.600
 And her mom said, well, I don't know if it's a thing,

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:11.720
 you know, do your homework or whatever.

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:13.600
 And anyway, she decided to do a study.

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:15.040
 So she went to her school

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:18.400
 and she watched as these magpies swooped people

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:21.160
 and then did a survey of anyone who'd been swooped saying,

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:22.560
 you know, how tall are you?

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:24.200
 What's your hairstyle?

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:25.200
 What sex are you?

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:26.600
 All that kind of stuff.

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:27.440
 - What's your hairstyle?

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:28.280
 None.

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:30.520
 (laughing)

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:34.720
 - Well, then she's supposed to have 100 people

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:37.120
 around the school, but then it went online

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:39.960
 and she got 30,000 people to participate

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:41.920
 on her survey online.

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:44.160
 And she found that statistically,

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:47.400
 magpies are more likely to go for bold people.

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:50.480
 And according to a magpie expert called Darryl Jones,

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:54.320
 her study is the first time anyone's ever examined this link.

00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:56.200
 And so she's doing brand new science

00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:57.600
 and learn this about people.

00:06:57.600 --> 00:06:59.480
 - So you know what bold people should do then?

00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:01.360
 Draw a face on the back of their head.

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:02.200
 - What?

00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:05.800
 - Magpies are less likely to go at anything that has eyes.

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:07.760
 And so if they're swooping from behind,

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:09.640
 they're just seeing a bold head all together.

00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:10.800
 - Oh, that could be icy.

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:12.520
 - Yeah, so there are a few things

00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:14.000
 that people think they've worked out

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:15.400
 that magpies won't sweep out.

00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:17.080
 One is if you have eyes at the back of your head.

00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:20.240
 So people often cyclists might often wear glasses,

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:22.840
 sunglasses on the back of their head facing that way

00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:24.200
 to give the impression there are eyes there.

00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:26.040
 - A bit like in, is it in Africa,

00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:26.880
 we might have said before,

00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:29.200
 where they draw eyes on the bums of cows?

00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:30.040
 - Yes, exactly.

00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:31.080
 - Stop them being attacked by lions.

00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:31.920
 - Yeah.

00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:32.760
 - That's why that.

00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:33.600
 - 'Cause you can't be sneaked up on.

00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:36.400
 - It's so funny, they're a protected national species.

00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:39.160
 So if a magpie attacks you, you can't attack it back.

00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:40.560
 - You kind of just have to let it happen.

00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:41.400
 - Really?

00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:42.240
 - Yeah.

00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:43.080
 - That's funny.

00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:44.280
 - And so what they do then is if they've identified

00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:47.680
 an aggressive magpie, they have to ship him out of there.

00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:48.880
 But there's a minimum distance,

00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:50.440
 which is like 25 kilometers.

00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:52.480
 So because they'll just fly back.

00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:55.400
 - They don't respect the restraining order.

00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:57.440
 - Have you heard of the Windsor Road monster?

00:07:57.440 --> 00:07:58.280
 - No.

00:07:58.280 --> 00:08:01.880
 - That's an Australian magpie, specific one,

00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:03.400
 which was especially aggressive

00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:05.560
 and had to be put down in the end.

00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:07.100
 But it took a very long time.

00:08:07.100 --> 00:08:08.760
 I have to say, the Windsor Road monster

00:08:08.760 --> 00:08:11.520
 has given multiple chances to learn and change.

00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:14.520
 And it attacks, well, there were more than 40 complaints.

00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:17.480
 One person had a heart attack shortly after being swooped,

00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:18.720
 which is not the fact.

00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:20.760
 - You know, there could be other things happening

00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:23.040
 in that person's life that makes them more susceptible

00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:23.880
 to a heart attack.

00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:24.720
 - That's not true.

00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:25.560
 - It's not necessarily the--

00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:26.640
 - That's true, that's true.

00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:28.040
 But it didn't, no, you're right.

00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:29.200
 But it was going for people's faces.

00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:32.000
 It was going under cyclist's helmets to get them.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.320
 It was even for an Australian magpie,

00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:36.160
 it was being especially aggressive.

00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:37.200
 - You're bowled under there, mate.

00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:38.640
 - What's going on?

00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:39.760
 Where are you hiding?

00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:41.960
 - They're just trying to protect their ground.

00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:45.840
 They spend most of their life just protecting their area.

00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:48.880
 So they choose their radius, and it's quite small.

00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:51.240
 And they will just spend the whole time just standing,

00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:54.400
 like, as bounces on the edge of their patch,

00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:57.480
 being like, don't come in here all the time.

00:08:57.480 --> 00:08:59.600
 - So there was one cyclist who I read about

00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:01.560
 called Dr. Richard Osborne,

00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:04.120
 who came up with this new cycle helmet.

00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:07.240
 - I don't think I've seen this.

00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:08.440
 - Does it have a face on it?

00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:09.440
 - No, it doesn't have a face.

00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:10.560
 Can you guess what it is?

00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:14.080
 He uses a thing I have around my house

00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:16.080
 to scare them away.

00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:18.320
 - So I know this, so I won't guess.

00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:19.520
 - Yeah, okay, melts out.

00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:21.040
 - I could have seemed really smart.

00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:23.880
 - Oh, stop using James' personality to look out for it.

00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:25.200
 - It was a golf club.

00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:27.400
 - What do you know about things that happened in my life

00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:28.960
 in the last two weeks?

00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:29.920
 - The last two weeks?

00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:31.840
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:33.040
 All my family members.

00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:36.880
 - Your kid has had a birthday.

00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:37.720
 - Yeah.

00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:39.360
 - Your daughter's two years old.

00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:40.200
 - Yeah.

00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:42.120
 - So you see, you put the hours in with people then.

00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:47.120
 - What a way to find out that's your daughter's birthday.

00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:48.680
 (all laughing)

00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:50.760
 - Oh no, Uncle Dan hasn't forgotten about you.

00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:52.600
 No, no, he's been very busy.

00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:54.440
 I'm sure the gifts on its way.

00:09:54.440 --> 00:09:55.280
 - Oh my God.

00:09:55.280 --> 00:09:58.560
 - She built a helmet to ward Dan away, I think, yeah.

00:09:58.560 --> 00:10:01.920
 - Does the bike have a mortal baby pinioned on top of it?

00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:03.320
 - A little bit or a doll.

00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:05.520
 - It has, you know, these party blowers

00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:07.160
 where you blow them and they go, pfft.

00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:08.600
 And they kind of stick out.

00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:10.720
 He has those attached to his helmet

00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:12.760
 and there's a tube attached to them.

00:10:12.760 --> 00:10:14.720
 So the, and Magpie comes there,

00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:17.000
 he blows into the tube and they all go, pfft.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:18.200
 - Is this what you were thinking, though?

00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:19.040
 - No.

00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:21.280
 (all laughing)

00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:23.960
 - I just see the guy who had tied a lot of cable ties

00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:24.800
 to his hair.

00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:25.800
 - That's very funny.

00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:28.720
 - And does he, has it sort of caught on?

00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:30.320
 - Yeah, well, no, it's not caught on

00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:31.640
 because he looks like an idiot,

00:10:31.640 --> 00:10:35.320
 but you said it seemed a bit safer than carrying a stick

00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:37.240
 and waving it around, which was his other option.

00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:39.040
 - Yeah, or having spikes, which a lot of people do,

00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:41.520
 they're not sharp spikes, but they are sticky out.

00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:42.360
 - Is that right?

00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:43.200
 - Yeah, yeah, just as a deterrent.

00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:46.280
 - The best thing to do is to just be nice to them.

00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:47.120
 - Yeah.

00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:47.960
 - Because they will remember you being nice.

00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:49.680
 So what happens is people run away and they go,

00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:51.800
 oh, you are guilty, why are you running?

00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:55.720
 Therefore, it just fills this prophecy in their head.

00:10:55.720 --> 00:10:57.720
 - But to be nice to them, if you're in their area,

00:10:57.720 --> 00:10:59.200
 so you just, how can you be nice?

00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:00.160
 - You just feed them.

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:02.720
 You just leave them out like little peanuts and things.

00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:04.440
 That's what my boyfriend has been trying to do,

00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:07.760
 like leaving peanuts outside our yard and getting them to come.

00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:09.440
 And yes, and then when they like you,

00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:11.400
 they'll bring their kids along to be like,

00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:13.640
 here's my kids, you miss the good day.

00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:17.320
 - One nice thing that you can do for them

00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:19.760
 is actually something that will get you in trouble with them,

00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:22.280
 which is if you see one of their babies struggling

00:11:22.280 --> 00:11:23.240
 and you go to help it,

00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:25.360
 they will view that as you hurting their babies

00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:26.720
 'cause they haven't introduced you to it.

00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:28.520
 So be careful how nice you are.

00:11:28.520 --> 00:11:30.920
 - And that's why you didn't give a gift.

00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:33.000
 As nice as they viewed as a threat.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.200
 - Playgrounds, playgrounds are like that, you know.

00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:36.040
 - Are they?

00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:36.960
 - Well, if you see a child that's struggling

00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:37.960
 and you go over to help it,

00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:38.800
 their parents might think,

00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:40.400
 "Who's this guy who's approaching my child?"

00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:41.240
 - Yes.

00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:42.080
 (laughing)

00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:42.920
 - "This guy's left the fence.

00:11:42.920 --> 00:11:44.280
 "I can't remember not to wear my costume

00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:45.120
 "when I'm doing that."

00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:46.720
 (laughing)

00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:48.200
 - I'm weighing my clothes.

00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:50.440
 (laughing)

00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:54.920
 - Do you have lots of superstitions about them in Australia?

00:11:54.920 --> 00:11:56.720
 - I have heard of these superstitions,

00:11:56.720 --> 00:12:00.520
 but I don't think I follow them in my day to day life.

00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:02.680
 - 'Cause that's pretty much what they're well known for here,

00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:03.520
 right?

00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:04.360
 - Yeah, I follow quite a few.

00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:05.480
 - So when you see one,

00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:07.400
 do you say like, "Hello, Mr. Magpie.

00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:09.400
 "Where's your wife?" or something?

00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:10.240
 - Good morning, my Lord,

00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:11.060
 and how's your wife and children?

00:12:11.060 --> 00:12:11.900
 Yes.

00:12:11.900 --> 00:12:12.740
 - Right.

00:12:12.740 --> 00:12:13.580
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:12:13.580 --> 00:12:14.400
 - And do you do that?

00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:15.240
 - I do, yeah.

00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:16.400
 - And what about if you see one on its own?

00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:18.080
 Seeing two is fine, three is fine, whatever.

00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:20.520
 And one on its own, bad luck, so you just quickly, you know.

00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:22.240
 - 'Cause in Australia, that's a lot to get out

00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:23.840
 while it's coming for your eyes, isn't it?

00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:26.280
 - Yeah, exactly, that's very, ah!

00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:28.160
 That's it, yeah, that's what I'm gonna say, yeah.

00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:30.680
 But no, there are all these things,

00:12:30.680 --> 00:12:33.160
 like the magpie landed on the cross

00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:35.160
 when Christ was being crucified,

00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:37.880
 or the tongue of a magpie contains a drop of blood

00:12:37.880 --> 00:12:39.400
 from the devil himself.

00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:41.120
 - I think if they open their mouth,

00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:43.180
 there is a little bit of red in there, isn't there?

00:12:43.180 --> 00:12:46.080
 I think that's why they associated with Jesus.

00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:47.320
 - And that's why if you scratch its tongue

00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:48.620
 with the edge of a silver sixpence

00:12:48.620 --> 00:12:50.360
 and put a drop of blood into the wound,

00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:52.280
 it will gain the power of speech.

00:12:52.280 --> 00:12:55.840
 (all laughing)

00:12:55.840 --> 00:12:56.820
 - We've all been there.

00:12:56.820 --> 00:12:57.840
 (all laughing)

00:12:57.840 --> 00:12:59.360
 - There's so much slander about them

00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:01.360
 from back in the day, particularly religious.

00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:04.440
 So the one about the crucifix, apparently,

00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:06.320
 it was the only bird not to cry

00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:10.080
 when Jesus was crucified, and that was big news.

00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:11.920
 And then in the 19th century, there was a vicar

00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:13.240
 who said it was the only bird

00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:14.920
 that refused to go on Noah's Ark,

00:13:14.920 --> 00:13:19.160
 rather it just wanted, it hung outside swearing instead.

00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:21.760
 In France, the idea is that a magpie

00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:24.960
 is a reincarnated evil nun.

00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:26.320
 - I can see it, I guess.

00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:27.600
 (all laughing)

00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:29.960
 - British magpies eat a lot of dog poo.

00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:31.880
 - Oh, wow. - Yeah.

00:13:31.880 --> 00:13:33.240
 Even if there's other food around,

00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:34.720
 they'll eat the dog. - Really?

00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:35.560
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:13:35.560 --> 00:13:38.400
 And to such the extent that people in parks

00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:39.680
 have noticed that they'll,

00:13:39.680 --> 00:13:41.840
 'cause they're quite smart, obviously, magpies,

00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:44.280
 they'll go to the dog poo bins,

00:13:44.280 --> 00:13:45.920
 pull out a bag of dog poo,

00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:47.600
 rip open the bag of dog poo,

00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:48.880
 and then have a little snack.

00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:50.200
 - Oh, my God. - Oh, my God.

00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:51.640
 - That's some self-respect.

00:13:51.640 --> 00:13:53.320
 - What? - That was awful.

00:13:53.320 --> 00:13:55.200
 - It was nutritious. - Might taste great.

00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:57.120
 - I've never tried it, I don't know if it's good or not.

00:13:57.120 --> 00:13:58.440
 - Oh. (all laughing)

00:13:58.440 --> 00:13:59.800
 - I just wanted to say, we don't know.

00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:01.080
 - You said, "Might taste great."

00:14:01.080 --> 00:14:01.920
 - Yeah. - And I heard you saying,

00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:02.880
 "Mine tastes great."

00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:03.720
 (all laughing)

00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:05.960
 - Actually, I'm just gonna gloss on the move past it,

00:14:05.960 --> 00:14:07.880
 'cause, you know, we've got a guest.

00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:09.200
 - You guys at a park,

00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:11.600
 is that you're trying to go through the dog poo,

00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:13.400
 you're naked at a playground.

00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:14.240
 (all laughing)

00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:15.400
 It's a whole image.

00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:18.400
 - James has got a party before he was scammed out his head.

00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:19.880
 - Yeah. - Oh, my God.

00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:21.360
 - They do have them in New Zealand.

00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:22.480
 - They do, yes. - My pies, don't they?

00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:24.640
 But they've come over from Australia.

00:14:24.640 --> 00:14:26.920
 Apparently, no one's trying to get rid of them in New Zealand.

00:14:26.920 --> 00:14:27.920
 You know, like in New Zealand,

00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:29.600
 there's quite a lot of invasive species

00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:30.600
 and they're trying to get rid of them.

00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:32.280
 Well, they're not doing it with my pies

00:14:32.280 --> 00:14:34.040
 because it's too hard, basically.

00:14:34.040 --> 00:14:35.880
 - Yeah. - You get rid of two magpies

00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:39.600
 from an area and then the next two will move in.

00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:41.600
 But apparently, what I read is they've got

00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:45.520
 a bad reputation in New Zealand, these magpies,

00:14:45.520 --> 00:14:47.640
 because they're big, showy, noisy,

00:14:47.640 --> 00:14:50.720
 and according to the article, it must be said, "Australian."

00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:52.880
 - Oh, yes. (laughing)

00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:54.920
 That really does rub us the wrong way.

00:14:54.920 --> 00:14:56.600
 That's how I can understand it.

00:14:56.600 --> 00:14:58.840
 (laughing)

00:14:58.840 --> 00:15:01.640
 - Did you hear of these acclimatisation societies?

00:15:01.640 --> 00:15:03.080
 - Yes. - 'Cause that was,

00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:04.200
 they're Australian magpies,

00:15:04.200 --> 00:15:07.440
 but they were introduced to New Zealand by societies saying,

00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:08.680
 I'm not sure what the rationale was actually,

00:15:08.680 --> 00:15:10.360
 'cause it was not as though they were gonna be hunted or--

00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:12.040
 - Well, they thought that there wasn't enough

00:15:12.040 --> 00:15:14.560
 nice animals in New Zealand.

00:15:14.560 --> 00:15:17.200
 - And in fact, I've heard that a lot, yeah, famously.

00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:19.720
 - Yeah, well, they were like, you know, there's not--

00:15:19.720 --> 00:15:23.480
 - There's no endemic mammals to New Zealand,

00:15:23.480 --> 00:15:27.320
 apart from a bat, so any mammals weren't really there.

00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:29.440
 - They got there, and they're like, "Where's the rabbits?"

00:15:29.440 --> 00:15:30.280
 - Yeah. - You know,

00:15:30.280 --> 00:15:31.640
 "Where's the tweeting birds?"

00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:33.200
 We don't know where they are.

00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:35.920
 - But I feel like it's such a bird-heavy place,

00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:37.920
 or certainly would have been in the 19th century,

00:15:37.920 --> 00:15:40.760
 as in, why would you introduce more birds, you know?

00:15:40.760 --> 00:15:42.800
 - Yeah, they're like, maybe some that can fly

00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:45.120
 would be useful. - Yeah, exactly.

00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:46.880
 Like the cacophore, that's a New Zealand one as well.

00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:48.120
 - Yeah, but a lot of them kind of hide

00:15:48.120 --> 00:15:50.600
 in the middle of the night. - Yeah, yeah.

00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:54.560
 - Even the kiwi bird, I don't think I've ever seen one.

00:15:54.560 --> 00:15:55.880
 - Really? - You go to the zoo,

00:15:55.880 --> 00:15:59.240
 and they say they're in there, but I don't reckon they are.

00:15:59.240 --> 00:16:01.000
 I think it's just they've put a red light

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:04.360
 in a cave-looking area, and they go, "There's kiwi in there."

00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:06.040
 (all laugh)

00:16:06.040 --> 00:16:08.600
 - Tasmanian devils, I've gone every year

00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:11.000
 to see a Tasmanian devil at Taronga Zoo in Sydney,

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:12.040
 and you never see one.

00:16:12.040 --> 00:16:13.800
 - You never see them spinning around like a tornado.

00:16:13.800 --> 00:16:15.440
 - Yeah, no, no, no, no.

00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:18.400
 - You do hear a little bit of that in the background, but yeah.

00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:20.980
 (upbeat music)

00:16:20.980 --> 00:16:25.880
 - Okay, it is time for fact number two, that is James.

00:16:25.880 --> 00:16:28.840
 - Okay, my fact this week is that the sport of netball

00:16:28.840 --> 00:16:32.000
 was invented because its creator thought basketball

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:35.080
 made women grow better and lose control.

00:16:35.080 --> 00:16:37.320
 - Wow, as a player of both sports,

00:16:37.320 --> 00:16:38.720
 I will say this is true.

00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:40.880
 (laughs)

00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:42.920
 I play social netball, you know,

00:16:42.920 --> 00:16:45.040
 and it's always very wholesome.

00:16:45.040 --> 00:16:47.680
 The slogan of netball is just, "Here if you need,"

00:16:47.680 --> 00:16:49.160
 it's so beautiful.

00:16:49.160 --> 00:16:50.400
 That's just what you say a lot, you know,

00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:52.000
 when you pass the ball, you go, "Here if you need,"

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:53.560
 like, you know, like, "Pass them on me,"

00:16:53.560 --> 00:16:55.840
 you say, "Here if you need," like, "I'm over here."

00:16:55.840 --> 00:16:57.840
 It's very wholesome, but then I play basketball

00:16:57.840 --> 00:16:59.680
 and I become a feral beast.

00:16:59.680 --> 00:17:01.280
 (all laugh)

00:17:01.280 --> 00:17:02.600
 - It's so interesting.

00:17:02.600 --> 00:17:05.200
 - So what's the key difference that causes that?

00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:07.080
 - I don't know if this is--

00:17:07.080 --> 00:17:09.120
 - Well, basketball is technically no contact.

00:17:09.120 --> 00:17:11.600
 - But you're trying to take the ball off someone

00:17:11.600 --> 00:17:12.840
 and you can run beside them.

00:17:12.840 --> 00:17:15.680
 So basics of netball is once you catch the ball,

00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:17.000
 you can't move.

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:19.040
 If you're taking a shot, no one can defend you.

00:17:19.040 --> 00:17:21.080
 - They can, with three feet away.

00:17:21.080 --> 00:17:23.040
 - From three feet away, which is, I would argue,

00:17:23.040 --> 00:17:23.880
 too many feet.

00:17:23.880 --> 00:17:25.200
 (all laugh)

00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:26.480
 - And you can't dribble along the court.

00:17:26.480 --> 00:17:28.200
 - You can't dribble, okay, okay, okay, okay.

00:17:28.200 --> 00:17:32.280
 - So anyway, this all comes from a woman called Clara Bear

00:17:32.280 --> 00:17:35.000
 who was working at Newcombe College in New Orleans,

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:37.240
 and she'd been asked to come up with a new sport

00:17:37.240 --> 00:17:39.880
 for women to play because this was an old women's school.

00:17:39.880 --> 00:17:42.160
 And she decided, she came up with a few ideas,

00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:44.360
 but her main one was to adapt sports

00:17:44.360 --> 00:17:45.840
 of being played by men.

00:17:45.840 --> 00:17:48.200
 So basketball had just become really popular,

00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:51.320
 been invented by James Naismith a few years earlier.

00:17:51.320 --> 00:17:54.080
 And so she wrote to him and asked for the rules.

00:17:54.080 --> 00:17:55.240
 She got the rules and said, right,

00:17:55.240 --> 00:17:56.760
 we're gonna play basketball.

00:17:56.760 --> 00:17:59.600
 But anyone who was there said it was a mad game

00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:02.480
 in which the women grew bitter and lost control.

00:18:02.480 --> 00:18:05.800
 Even she herself said it was not entirely satisfactory.

00:18:05.800 --> 00:18:07.320
 And so she thought, well, I'm gonna have to invent

00:18:07.320 --> 00:18:09.160
 a new game which doesn't have all this stuff

00:18:09.160 --> 00:18:11.440
 because this is just not appropriate to women.

00:18:11.440 --> 00:18:12.880
 And so she came up with that ball.

00:18:12.880 --> 00:18:13.880
 - Interesting.

00:18:13.880 --> 00:18:16.080
 You say that netball is a non-contact sport,

00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:18.240
 but I don't think it actually is

00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:20.800
 because non-contact would be something like tennis

00:18:20.800 --> 00:18:22.960
 where you genuinely don't touch anyone else.

00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:24.240
 But netball, there are certain rules.

00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:27.280
 So if I was to run into the space to get the ball

00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:28.880
 and someone else is running in

00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:31.160
 and I shoulder barge them on the way,

00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:33.160
 that is really one of the rules of the game.

00:18:33.160 --> 00:18:36.120
 Like there is, the art of learning to play netball

00:18:36.120 --> 00:18:39.040
 is to learn how to be very aggressive

00:18:39.040 --> 00:18:40.600
 within the confines of the rules.

00:18:40.600 --> 00:18:42.360
 - Oh, yeah, yeah, okay.

00:18:42.360 --> 00:18:44.040
 Yeah, we used to play it at school.

00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:45.480
 And I went to a city.

00:18:45.480 --> 00:18:46.560
 Yeah, I went to a Steiner school.

00:18:46.560 --> 00:18:47.880
 So I think that was more,

00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:49.600
 feels like a made up Steiner sport, really.

00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:51.840
 Steiner's a very hippie non-competitive kind of thing.

00:18:51.840 --> 00:18:53.520
 And it feels like instead of basketball,

00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:54.960
 let's do netball instead.

00:18:54.960 --> 00:18:56.280
 - So can I check a few more rules?

00:18:56.280 --> 00:18:57.120
 - Yeah.

00:18:57.120 --> 00:18:59.520
 - So Mel, is there still no shouting

00:18:59.520 --> 00:19:01.480
 or talking during the game?

00:19:01.480 --> 00:19:02.400
 Is that still observed?

00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:04.160
 - Interesting.

00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:05.320
 Where is that from?

00:19:05.320 --> 00:19:07.280
 Is that from the most recent rule?

00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:10.520
 - That was from Clara Bear's founding rules

00:19:10.520 --> 00:19:11.680
 right off the game.

00:19:11.680 --> 00:19:13.480
 - You can't talk back to the umpire,

00:19:13.480 --> 00:19:15.880
 so you couldn't say, "Oh, what was that?"

00:19:15.880 --> 00:19:17.200
 - In the first rules for sure,

00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:19.560
 if you spoke, if you said anything in the game,

00:19:19.560 --> 00:19:20.600
 it was a foul.

00:19:20.600 --> 00:19:21.440
 - Oh, wow!

00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:22.480
 - Even here if you need.

00:19:22.480 --> 00:19:24.200
 - Yeah, you won't have to say that.

00:19:24.200 --> 00:19:27.840
 - I read no falling over was also a rid, which I can't.

00:19:27.840 --> 00:19:29.360
 - Don't struggle to compute.

00:19:29.360 --> 00:19:30.880
 - That seems a bit harsh, doesn't it?

00:19:30.880 --> 00:19:31.720
 - Yeah, it does.

00:19:31.720 --> 00:19:34.640
 - It's a weird rule that there's sort of a hangover there.

00:19:34.640 --> 00:19:36.560
 If you catch the ball and you fall over,

00:19:36.560 --> 00:19:37.640
 you're not allowed to move with the ball,

00:19:37.640 --> 00:19:39.560
 but if you are on the ground,

00:19:39.560 --> 00:19:41.680
 you can't throw the ball from the ground.

00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:42.520
 - What?

00:19:42.520 --> 00:19:44.200
 - So you have to make your way back up to standing

00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:46.080
 before you can throw the ball.

00:19:46.080 --> 00:19:47.560
 But you have to keep your feet planted.

00:19:47.560 --> 00:19:49.600
 So where your feet landed when you fell over,

00:19:49.600 --> 00:19:51.160
 you have to just weirdly stand up.

00:19:51.160 --> 00:19:54.000
 - Do you look like one of those inflatable car selling

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:55.320
 balloon guns?

00:19:55.320 --> 00:19:57.440
 - You just have to rise up, yeah.

00:19:57.440 --> 00:19:58.560
 - That's great, that's brilliant.

00:19:58.560 --> 00:20:00.400
 - That's a good rule, I like that.

00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:04.400
 - She also said no needlessly rough play was in her rules.

00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:07.560
 And all shots had to be taken with one hand.

00:20:07.560 --> 00:20:09.880
 Because there was a thought that by throwing it

00:20:09.880 --> 00:20:11.840
 with two hands, it was unladylike

00:20:11.840 --> 00:20:15.400
 and might somehow make women less feminine was the idea.

00:20:15.400 --> 00:20:18.560
 - I read there would be inclination of the shoulders forward

00:20:18.560 --> 00:20:21.200
 with consequent flattening of the chest.

00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:22.040
 - Precisely, yeah.

00:20:22.040 --> 00:20:24.000
 - And that would not be a graceful position for girls.

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:24.840
 - That's what they said.

00:20:24.840 --> 00:20:26.680
 But it's interesting because the one-handed throw

00:20:26.680 --> 00:20:28.920
 was in netball from the very start,

00:20:28.920 --> 00:20:30.200
 they had one-handed throw.

00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:31.840
 But in basketball, there was none of it

00:20:31.840 --> 00:20:33.120
 until about the 1930s.

00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:35.480
 It was all two-handed throwing into the baskets.

00:20:35.480 --> 00:20:36.480
 - As a rule, was it?

00:20:36.480 --> 00:20:37.640
 - No, it's just that was the way.

00:20:37.640 --> 00:20:38.800
 - That was the way they did it, yeah.

00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:41.440
 - Yeah, I love as well that she basically,

00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:43.400
 she originally was starting basketball

00:20:43.400 --> 00:20:45.040
 as a female version of it.

00:20:45.040 --> 00:20:47.360
 And she called it basketball.

00:20:47.360 --> 00:20:49.840
 She just changed it to QUE.

00:20:49.840 --> 00:20:51.240
 - Well, I think what happened there is,

00:20:51.240 --> 00:20:53.840
 she wrote to Naismith who came up with the original thing.

00:20:53.840 --> 00:20:57.120
 And she said, here's my new sport, what do you think?

00:20:57.120 --> 00:20:58.360
 It's women's basketball.

00:20:58.360 --> 00:20:59.520
 And he wrote back saying, well,

00:20:59.520 --> 00:21:01.240
 it's not really the same as basketball.

00:21:01.240 --> 00:21:03.000
 So you should change the name a little bit.

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:05.840
 And she said, okay, I'll change it to basketball.

00:21:05.840 --> 00:21:07.280
 - And then part of the rules were developed

00:21:07.280 --> 00:21:09.440
 because she just misunderstood what he'd sent back.

00:21:09.440 --> 00:21:11.040
 There were dots all over it.

00:21:11.040 --> 00:21:13.800
 And she took that to mean seven different zones.

00:21:13.800 --> 00:21:15.600
 So you would be stuck in your zone.

00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:17.880
 And that got applied to the initial rules.

00:21:17.880 --> 00:21:18.960
 - We should not still change.

00:21:18.960 --> 00:21:22.680
 - Yeah, yeah, a goalkeeper is still in one-third of the court.

00:21:22.680 --> 00:21:25.480
 A center can go in most of the court, but not the two.

00:21:25.480 --> 00:21:26.480
 It's very complicated.

00:21:26.480 --> 00:21:28.200
 - It's not very sociable, is it?

00:21:28.200 --> 00:21:31.120
 Like if, yeah, there's some people who never really see it.

00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:31.960
 - Exactly.

00:21:31.960 --> 00:21:34.560
 Like I will chat to a goal shooter as a goalkeeper a lot,

00:21:34.560 --> 00:21:37.280
 but I will never see my team's goal shooter.

00:21:37.280 --> 00:21:38.840
 I just go, oh, well done.

00:21:38.840 --> 00:21:40.280
 (all laughing)

00:21:40.280 --> 00:21:43.680
 - But it's safe and the women look very womenly as a result.

00:21:43.680 --> 00:21:45.600
 (all laughing)

00:21:45.600 --> 00:21:46.440
 - What a relief.

00:21:46.440 --> 00:21:48.480
 - The vision has remained from Clara Bear.

00:21:48.480 --> 00:21:49.840
 - Do you play volleyball as well, Mel?

00:21:49.840 --> 00:21:50.680
 - I don't.

00:21:50.680 --> 00:21:53.240
 I just play netball and basketball, yeah.

00:21:53.240 --> 00:21:56.560
 - 'Cause apparently volleyball may have been nicked

00:21:56.560 --> 00:22:00.320
 basically a month after the first game of Newcombe ball,

00:22:00.320 --> 00:22:03.000
 which was another, Clara Bear invented Newcombe ball,

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:04.520
 but you throw the ball into the other team's area

00:22:04.520 --> 00:22:05.880
 so it hits the floor.

00:22:05.880 --> 00:22:06.720
 - Yes.

00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:07.640
 - Without them being able to catch it.

00:22:07.640 --> 00:22:10.080
 One month after that first game was written up,

00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:13.360
 William Morgan, the YMCA director in the USA,

00:22:13.360 --> 00:22:14.840
 he invented volleyball.

00:22:14.840 --> 00:22:16.560
 And it was basically apparently for older businessmen

00:22:16.560 --> 00:22:18.680
 on their lunch hour, was how it was described.

00:22:18.680 --> 00:22:20.120
 Which I think it has not stayed true to

00:22:20.120 --> 00:22:21.640
 over the years, volleyball.

00:22:21.640 --> 00:22:23.160
 - You know beach volleyball?

00:22:23.160 --> 00:22:24.000
 - Yeah.

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:25.520
 - There's an official rule that you're only allowed

00:22:25.520 --> 00:22:27.440
 to wear one watch.

00:22:27.440 --> 00:22:28.280
 - Oh, really?

00:22:28.280 --> 00:22:29.800
 - It's in the actual rules.

00:22:29.800 --> 00:22:31.120
 It says only one watch allowed.

00:22:31.120 --> 00:22:33.600
 - What possible advantage do you gain from two watches?

00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:34.440
 - What do you think?

00:22:34.440 --> 00:22:35.280
 - How interesting.

00:22:35.280 --> 00:22:37.400
 - Do you know what time it is in another part of the club?

00:22:37.400 --> 00:22:39.080
 (all laughing)

00:22:39.080 --> 00:22:40.160
 - Do you know the answer?

00:22:40.160 --> 00:22:41.000
 - I think I do, yeah.

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:42.600
 - Okay, so what advantage would you have?

00:22:42.600 --> 00:22:43.840
 - I mean, you'd never get a point.

00:22:43.840 --> 00:22:45.000
 - I have a punt.

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:47.000
 Is it that people were doing sponsorship deals

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:48.440
 with multiple watch companies?

00:22:48.440 --> 00:22:49.760
 - I can't believe that today.

00:22:49.760 --> 00:22:50.600
 - Interesting.

00:22:50.600 --> 00:22:51.440
 - Oh, that's great.

00:22:51.440 --> 00:22:52.360
 - 'Cause there's actually some rules

00:22:52.360 --> 00:22:55.800
 about how many temporary tattoos you're allowed

00:22:55.800 --> 00:22:57.360
 because people use those for appetizers.

00:22:57.360 --> 00:22:58.200
 - No.

00:22:58.200 --> 00:22:59.040
 - Obviously, don't have--

00:22:59.040 --> 00:22:59.880
 - Small real estate.

00:22:59.880 --> 00:23:00.720
 - Yeah.

00:23:00.720 --> 00:23:02.080
 (all laughing)

00:23:02.080 --> 00:23:02.920
 - Exactly.

00:23:02.920 --> 00:23:03.760
 - Yeah.

00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:04.600
 - It's so funny, isn't it?

00:23:04.600 --> 00:23:06.920
 - Because netball is so big in New Zealand and Australia.

00:23:06.920 --> 00:23:09.680
 I wasn't sure how much you guys knew about the sport.

00:23:09.680 --> 00:23:10.920
 I know you play in England.

00:23:10.920 --> 00:23:12.840
 You've got a very popular team.

00:23:12.840 --> 00:23:14.880
 But I was like, oh, I wonder what some unknown facts

00:23:14.880 --> 00:23:15.720
 about netball.

00:23:15.720 --> 00:23:18.840
 So of course, I looked it up and I found an article titled

00:23:18.840 --> 00:23:22.560
 "Fascinating Facts About Netball That You Never Knew."

00:23:22.560 --> 00:23:25.840
 Number one was, "How long is a netball game?"

00:23:25.840 --> 00:23:27.480
 (all laughing)

00:23:27.480 --> 00:23:28.400
 - Okay, well, let's try.

00:23:28.400 --> 00:23:29.720
 Does anyone here know how long it is?

00:23:29.720 --> 00:23:30.760
 - Actually, I do not know.

00:23:30.760 --> 00:23:33.720
 I would guess it's 80 minutes.

00:23:33.720 --> 00:23:34.840
 - Oh, I think it's less.

00:23:34.840 --> 00:23:38.000
 I've watched games, but I can't remember how long they were.

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:40.160
 I reckon maybe 60 minutes and quarters.

00:23:40.160 --> 00:23:41.160
 - Yeah, that's what I'm thinking.

00:23:41.160 --> 00:23:42.920
 I'm trying to work out, is it quarters as well?

00:23:42.920 --> 00:23:43.920
 And so I'm gonna say 60,

00:23:43.920 --> 00:23:45.120
 'cause I heard you just say yes.

00:23:45.120 --> 00:23:47.160
 (all laughing)

00:23:47.160 --> 00:23:49.360
 - Yes, I acknowledge your answer and it's incorrect.

00:23:49.360 --> 00:23:51.000
 No, no, it is actually.

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:52.760
 It's for 15 minute quarters.

00:23:52.760 --> 00:23:54.080
 - Fascinating fact.

00:23:54.080 --> 00:23:55.140
 - Yes, fascinating fact.

00:23:55.140 --> 00:23:57.440
 - Number two, "What is netball?"

00:23:57.440 --> 00:23:59.920
 (all laughing)

00:23:59.920 --> 00:24:02.400
 I think it's a real entry-level article,

00:24:02.400 --> 00:24:04.920
 that I had come across.

00:24:04.920 --> 00:24:06.760
 - I love the way that the first thing you need to learn

00:24:06.760 --> 00:24:07.720
 is how long it is.

00:24:07.720 --> 00:24:10.120
 And then the second one is, "What is it?"

00:24:10.120 --> 00:24:11.520
 It's like, "Do you wanna play netball?"

00:24:11.520 --> 00:24:12.800
 Well, how long will it be?

00:24:12.800 --> 00:24:13.640
 (all laughing)

00:24:13.640 --> 00:24:14.480
 - 60 minutes.

00:24:14.480 --> 00:24:15.320
 It's got two watches on.

00:24:15.320 --> 00:24:17.800
 (all laughing)

00:24:17.800 --> 00:24:18.640
 - You're right.

00:24:18.640 --> 00:24:20.760
 So I grew up in Oz for my teenage years.

00:24:20.760 --> 00:24:22.360
 Netball was massive there,

00:24:22.360 --> 00:24:24.080
 and I assumed it was globally massive.

00:24:24.080 --> 00:24:25.980
 It's an American invention, but in America,

00:24:25.980 --> 00:24:26.940
 it's not really played.

00:24:26.940 --> 00:24:28.220
 It's getting back now,

00:24:28.220 --> 00:24:30.220
 and particularly Aussies and New Zealanders

00:24:30.220 --> 00:24:33.020
 keep going over to schools to try and reintegrate it.

00:24:33.020 --> 00:24:36.380
 So Ross Day is someone who went over to try and get it done.

00:24:36.380 --> 00:24:38.500
 And she said, "What are the biggest challenges?"

00:24:38.500 --> 00:24:40.260
 I can't believe this is true.

00:24:40.260 --> 00:24:41.220
 Must be target cheek.

00:24:41.220 --> 00:24:42.540
 She says, "One of the biggest challenges

00:24:42.540 --> 00:24:44.180
 "is that when we're pitching netball,

00:24:44.180 --> 00:24:46.900
 "is that because of our accents being Aussie and New Zealand,

00:24:46.900 --> 00:24:48.460
 "everyone thinks we're saying nipple."

00:24:48.460 --> 00:24:53.460
 - Yes, I get this, I will say something about nipple,

00:24:53.540 --> 00:24:56.240
 and I'll be like, "Oh, that was a great netball play."

00:24:56.240 --> 00:24:59.040
 And it has a whole different meaning.

00:24:59.040 --> 00:24:59.880
 And the comments, people are like,

00:24:59.880 --> 00:25:01.960
 "What are you talking about?"

00:25:01.960 --> 00:25:03.840
 - Wow, so someone will come up to you and say,

00:25:03.840 --> 00:25:05.920
 "Do you want a better nipple play?"

00:25:05.920 --> 00:25:07.740
 And you go, "How long will it be?"

00:25:07.740 --> 00:25:09.600
 (all laughing)

00:25:09.600 --> 00:25:10.440
 - Wait, quick double check.

00:25:10.440 --> 00:25:11.280
 It is what you think it is.

00:25:11.280 --> 00:25:12.440
 What is nipple?

00:25:12.440 --> 00:25:14.680
 (all laughing)

00:25:14.680 --> 00:25:15.840
 - That's so funny.

00:25:15.840 --> 00:25:18.680
 - I like the early forms of basketball

00:25:18.680 --> 00:25:19.960
 were interesting as well.

00:25:19.960 --> 00:25:23.740
 I like how they first started with a peach basket,

00:25:23.740 --> 00:25:26.700
 but they didn't think to put a hole in the bottom.

00:25:26.700 --> 00:25:30.460
 So, in the early games, they would have to stop the game

00:25:30.460 --> 00:25:32.580
 to go retrieve the ball from the basket

00:25:32.580 --> 00:25:34.220
 and climb up a ladder.

00:25:34.220 --> 00:25:36.700
 - I suppose, in a way, if you have a hole,

00:25:36.700 --> 00:25:38.780
 it's not always certain if the ball's gone in.

00:25:38.780 --> 00:25:40.100
 - Yeah, that is true.

00:25:40.100 --> 00:25:41.060
 - Is that producing netball?

00:25:41.060 --> 00:25:42.740
 - Sometimes, if I shoot in it,

00:25:42.740 --> 00:25:44.460
 'cause you go for the swish sound,

00:25:44.460 --> 00:25:46.620
 but sometimes you could just shoot so far

00:25:46.620 --> 00:25:48.940
 that it just hits the net and makes that sound anyway.

00:25:48.940 --> 00:25:50.640
 And you go, "Oh, okay, I know."

00:25:50.640 --> 00:25:52.460
 (all laughing)

00:25:52.460 --> 00:25:55.860
 - In football, in soccer, there's been this thing

00:25:55.860 --> 00:25:59.560
 where you have a board next to the goal.

00:25:59.560 --> 00:26:01.120
 I think it was in Queen's Park Rangers,

00:26:01.120 --> 00:26:03.380
 and they scored a goal, and it hit the board,

00:26:03.380 --> 00:26:05.040
 and then bounced straight back out again,

00:26:05.040 --> 00:26:07.520
 and the goal didn't get given, because, yeah.

00:26:07.520 --> 00:26:08.800
 - I don't understand how that,

00:26:08.800 --> 00:26:10.420
 so it hit the board next to the--

00:26:10.420 --> 00:26:11.420
 - So, it's gone into the net?

00:26:11.420 --> 00:26:12.680
 - Yeah, sorry, I didn't explain that very well.

00:26:12.680 --> 00:26:14.500
 So, you've got the goal, the goal post,

00:26:14.500 --> 00:26:15.640
 and you've got the net,

00:26:15.640 --> 00:26:17.120
 but then you've got an advertising board

00:26:17.120 --> 00:26:18.880
 right behind the goal.

00:26:18.880 --> 00:26:22.100
 And so, the ball goes in, hits the advertising board,

00:26:22.100 --> 00:26:23.740
 bounces straight back out again,

00:26:23.740 --> 00:26:25.660
 and the referee goes, "Well, I didn't see it go in."

00:26:25.660 --> 00:26:26.500
 - Oh!

00:26:26.500 --> 00:26:29.060
 - And it happened quite recently

00:26:29.060 --> 00:26:30.580
 where there was a hole in the net,

00:26:30.580 --> 00:26:32.260
 as in one that wasn't supposed to be there,

00:26:32.260 --> 00:26:33.580
 a bigger than the normal hole.

00:26:33.580 --> 00:26:34.420
 (all laughing)

00:26:34.420 --> 00:26:36.860
 And the ball went in, and it went through the hole,

00:26:36.860 --> 00:26:38.860
 and no one could tell whether it had gone in or not.

00:26:38.860 --> 00:26:39.700
 That's good.

00:26:39.700 --> 00:26:40.820
 - That's a good thing for a goalie to do

00:26:40.820 --> 00:26:42.020
 when the action's happening up the other end.

00:26:42.020 --> 00:26:42.860
 (all laughing)

00:26:42.860 --> 00:26:44.100
 It's like somebody's saw through the net,

00:26:44.100 --> 00:26:45.780
 and then you'll be behind the saw.

00:26:45.780 --> 00:26:47.180
 (all laughing)

00:26:47.180 --> 00:26:48.500
 - Like Wiley Clay.

00:26:48.500 --> 00:26:50.340
 (all laughing)

00:26:50.340 --> 00:26:52.220
 - Did you, when you were sort of part

00:26:52.220 --> 00:26:54.060
 of the New Zealand netball scene,

00:26:54.060 --> 00:26:59.180
 did you, do you know anyone who played for the Master Baiters?

00:26:59.180 --> 00:27:01.340
 (all laughing)

00:27:01.340 --> 00:27:02.420
 Do you remember this?

00:27:02.420 --> 00:27:03.460
 - No.

00:27:03.460 --> 00:27:04.300
 - Okay. - I mean--

00:27:04.300 --> 00:27:06.220
 - It was just a cheeky little fun New Zealand thing,

00:27:06.220 --> 00:27:09.220
 but there was a Sydney World Masters games

00:27:09.220 --> 00:27:10.780
 where all netball teams were coming,

00:27:10.780 --> 00:27:12.740
 and there was a lot of New Zealand teams

00:27:12.740 --> 00:27:13.580
 that were coming over,

00:27:13.580 --> 00:27:15.020
 and they named themselves the Master Baiters,

00:27:15.020 --> 00:27:16.820
 and-- - Why?

00:27:16.820 --> 00:27:18.620
 - Well, it was a Masters,

00:27:18.620 --> 00:27:21.620
 and they were baiting, so with the Master Baiters.

00:27:21.620 --> 00:27:22.860
 - Yeah, the second baiting?

00:27:22.860 --> 00:27:24.980
 - Yeah, that was it. - What were they baiting?

00:27:24.980 --> 00:27:26.900
 - Baiting the other teams.

00:27:26.900 --> 00:27:28.780
 - Oh, I see. - Okay.

00:27:28.780 --> 00:27:29.620
 - I didn't come up with it.

00:27:29.620 --> 00:27:31.740
 (all laughing)

00:27:31.740 --> 00:27:35.300
 - I like how the sport of netball's evolved quite a lot.

00:27:35.300 --> 00:27:37.220
 There's different versions of this fast five,

00:27:37.220 --> 00:27:40.180
 which is basically, they've made it more like basketball.

00:27:40.180 --> 00:27:41.860
 There's five people on the court,

00:27:41.860 --> 00:27:43.620
 and there's, you can shoot three-point,

00:27:43.620 --> 00:27:45.820
 or two-pointers and things.

00:27:45.820 --> 00:27:48.300
 The Northern Mystics used a new move

00:27:48.300 --> 00:27:50.580
 called the Harrison Hoist,

00:27:50.580 --> 00:27:53.900
 because you have to be three feet away,

00:27:53.900 --> 00:27:57.940
 and so they had been practicing like a cheerleader lift,

00:27:57.940 --> 00:28:00.180
 and so she'd lifted her up,

00:28:00.180 --> 00:28:02.420
 and she was able to bat the ball over there

00:28:02.420 --> 00:28:04.580
 as it was going into the hoop. - Is that allowed?

00:28:04.580 --> 00:28:05.580
 - And yeah, it's allowed.

00:28:05.580 --> 00:28:07.180
 It was in the rules of the game,

00:28:07.180 --> 00:28:08.260
 and they were going to go,

00:28:08.260 --> 00:28:09.740
 "Oh, we'll save this for the finals,"

00:28:09.740 --> 00:28:10.580
 but then they were like,

00:28:10.580 --> 00:28:11.420
 "Okay, we might not get a final,"

00:28:11.420 --> 00:28:14.060
 so they had to do it in like a qualifying match.

00:28:14.060 --> 00:28:16.220
 It's one of those things that they don't do all the time now,

00:28:16.220 --> 00:28:18.180
 because in theory, if you knew it was coming,

00:28:18.180 --> 00:28:19.260
 you could kind of counter it,

00:28:19.260 --> 00:28:21.620
 'cause you could only have two defenders in the circle,

00:28:21.620 --> 00:28:23.820
 so they had to use all of their resources,

00:28:23.820 --> 00:28:25.340
 but if you didn't see it coming,

00:28:25.340 --> 00:28:26.740
 you were like, "Ah, just a shot,"

00:28:26.740 --> 00:28:29.020
 and then suddenly she's in the sky.

00:28:29.020 --> 00:28:30.340
 - So it's like a rugby throw-in, basically.

00:28:30.340 --> 00:28:32.340
 - Yeah, like a line-out. - The way that, yeah,

00:28:32.340 --> 00:28:33.300
 they lifted into the air.

00:28:33.300 --> 00:28:35.420
 - You're not allowed to do that in football, by the way.

00:28:35.420 --> 00:28:37.020
 - Yeah, wow. - It's in the rules,

00:28:37.020 --> 00:28:38.300
 officially in the rules.

00:28:38.300 --> 00:28:39.700
 - Isn't it? - Yeah.

00:28:39.700 --> 00:28:41.420
 - Piggybacks. - If you--

00:28:41.420 --> 00:28:42.860
 - Fogging like a true athlete.

00:28:42.860 --> 00:28:44.660
 (all laughing)

00:28:44.660 --> 00:28:47.060
 - It's in the air, and you wanna head the ball in,

00:28:47.060 --> 00:28:49.820
 and you think, "Well, I'm gonna give my mate a piggyback."

00:28:49.820 --> 00:28:52.580
 It's not allowed, it's un-gentlemanly conduct,

00:28:52.580 --> 00:28:54.580
 it's called, it's an indirect free kick to the other team,

00:28:54.580 --> 00:28:56.660
 and both players should be cautioned.

00:28:56.660 --> 00:28:57.500
 - Get out. - Get out.

00:28:57.500 --> 00:28:58.340
 - Wow. - That's unfair.

00:28:58.340 --> 00:28:59.180
 I think you've got the weather ball

00:28:59.180 --> 00:29:01.460
 to put together a piggyback in that time,

00:29:01.460 --> 00:29:02.300
 and you should be allowed to do it.

00:29:02.300 --> 00:29:06.420
 - That was in my, 'cause I trained as a football referee,

00:29:06.420 --> 00:29:08.300
 and that was one of the questions that came up,

00:29:08.300 --> 00:29:10.020
 it's like, "What do you do in this situation?"

00:29:10.020 --> 00:29:12.740
 - Wow. - You give him a stern finger.

00:29:12.740 --> 00:29:14.980
 (all laughing)

00:29:14.980 --> 00:29:17.340
 - I really wanna watch Andy's version of football, though.

00:29:17.340 --> 00:29:18.180
 (all laughing)

00:29:18.180 --> 00:29:20.260
 It's a corner kick, he's gone for the piggyback,

00:29:20.260 --> 00:29:24.060
 it's gone in, oh no, someone sawed through the back of that,

00:29:24.060 --> 00:29:26.820
 and it has gone right through, no points.

00:29:26.820 --> 00:29:29.400
 (upbeat music)

00:29:29.400 --> 00:29:34.940
 - Okay, it is time for fact number three, and that is Andy.

00:29:34.940 --> 00:29:36.580
 My fact is that when the asteroid

00:29:36.580 --> 00:29:38.540
 which wiped out the dinosaurs hit,

00:29:38.540 --> 00:29:40.860
 there was a brief burst of radiation so strong

00:29:40.860 --> 00:29:44.740
 it would have immediately cooked some dinosaurs through.

00:29:44.740 --> 00:29:46.840
 - Whoa, like an air fryer.

00:29:46.840 --> 00:29:49.780
 - Yes, exactly, like an air fryer.

00:29:49.780 --> 00:29:52.140
 - This is, it's much less fun

00:29:52.140 --> 00:29:53.620
 than I've made it sound for the dinosaurs,

00:29:53.620 --> 00:29:55.060
 but what a, you know, for a brief--

00:29:55.060 --> 00:29:57.580
 - For like, the mammals survived, did they?

00:29:57.580 --> 00:30:00.900
 So could they have come out and eaten some dinosaur cooked?

00:30:00.900 --> 00:30:03.100
 - Yes, yes, they probably could, yeah.

00:30:03.100 --> 00:30:04.500
 - But you say for a brief moment,

00:30:04.500 --> 00:30:07.620
 so it was perfectly cooked and then they were charred

00:30:07.620 --> 00:30:09.940
 beyond oblivion, is that it?

00:30:09.940 --> 00:30:13.100
 'Cause you could say, oh here is my roast for a brief moment.

00:30:13.100 --> 00:30:18.100
 It was amazing, but it is a pile of ash now.

00:30:18.100 --> 00:30:21.620
 - Yeah, no, you're right, you're absolutely right.

00:30:21.620 --> 00:30:23.940
 I think a lot of, there weren't precise settings on.

00:30:23.940 --> 00:30:26.740
 This is from a fantastic book I've just read.

00:30:26.740 --> 00:30:29.060
 It's called Not the End of the World by Hannah Ritchie,

00:30:29.060 --> 00:30:31.380
 and it's about completely different stuff actually,

00:30:31.380 --> 00:30:35.020
 it's about sustainability and the big planetary challenges,

00:30:35.020 --> 00:30:38.420
 but she's writing in this bit about, you know,

00:30:38.420 --> 00:30:40.100
 extinction events and how fascinating

00:30:40.100 --> 00:30:41.420
 some of those have been over the past,

00:30:41.420 --> 00:30:42.900
 and this is about the dinosaurs,

00:30:42.900 --> 00:30:44.820
 65 million years ago, '66?

00:30:44.820 --> 00:30:45.660
 - '66.

00:30:45.660 --> 00:30:47.940
 - A while ago, and the asteroid hits.

00:30:47.940 --> 00:30:49.500
 - It was an old book that you read, wasn't it?

00:30:49.500 --> 00:30:50.840
 - Yeah, that's right.

00:30:50.840 --> 00:30:53.860
 (all laughing)

00:30:53.860 --> 00:30:55.940
 - Thing hits, there's a shockwave

00:30:55.940 --> 00:30:58.460
 that moves 17,000 miles an hour.

00:30:58.460 --> 00:31:00.620
 It's quite hard to get your head around some of this stuff.

00:31:00.620 --> 00:31:03.900
 And then this huge amount, like cubic miles of rock

00:31:03.900 --> 00:31:05.500
 get lifted up by the impact.

00:31:05.500 --> 00:31:08.340
 They then, so they've been liquidized

00:31:08.340 --> 00:31:09.980
 into these little glass balls,

00:31:09.980 --> 00:31:12.460
 which go all the way around the planet immediately,

00:31:12.460 --> 00:31:13.580
 and then that falls.

00:31:13.580 --> 00:31:15.540
 - It literally, the kind of sky falls down, you know.

00:31:15.540 --> 00:31:16.660
 - Yeah, rain's glass.

00:31:16.660 --> 00:31:18.340
 - Yeah, liquid rock, basically.

00:31:18.340 --> 00:31:20.860
 And lots of it gets blasted by friction in the atmosphere

00:31:20.860 --> 00:31:22.860
 'cause it's coming back into the atmosphere, if you see.

00:31:22.860 --> 00:31:23.700
 - Right.

00:31:23.700 --> 00:31:27.260
 - So then the energy is released as infrared radiation,

00:31:27.260 --> 00:31:30.260
 which turns into this massive blast of heat.

00:31:30.260 --> 00:31:31.100
 - Thank you.

00:31:31.100 --> 00:31:32.700
 - And if you were a dinosaur out in the open,

00:31:32.700 --> 00:31:35.300
 it's bad news, and it's really interesting

00:31:35.300 --> 00:31:38.380
 'cause why didn't everything burn immediately at that point?

00:31:38.380 --> 00:31:40.740
 And basically, there was a study in 2016

00:31:40.740 --> 00:31:42.100
 by a scientist called Sean Gulick,

00:31:42.100 --> 00:31:44.500
 who found out that either it was like being in a toaster

00:31:44.500 --> 00:31:47.340
 for a few hours, or a pizza oven for a few minutes.

00:31:47.340 --> 00:31:49.500
 It's bad news if you were out in the open.

00:31:49.500 --> 00:31:50.340
 - Okay, wow.

00:31:50.340 --> 00:31:51.780
 - So would there be some dinosaurs

00:31:51.780 --> 00:31:54.620
 who were the furthest away that would be nicely cooked?

00:31:54.620 --> 00:31:55.460
 - Yeah.

00:31:55.460 --> 00:31:56.300
 (all laughing)

00:31:56.300 --> 00:31:58.660
 - Medium round. - Just medium round, yes.

00:31:58.660 --> 00:32:00.540
 - So they get cooked by the radiation,

00:32:00.540 --> 00:32:02.980
 the innards are just completely just, they're cooked,

00:32:02.980 --> 00:32:04.700
 but so they die immediately,

00:32:04.700 --> 00:32:06.660
 or is it kind of like radiation where--

00:32:06.660 --> 00:32:07.620
 - If you were out in the open,

00:32:07.620 --> 00:32:09.300
 there's a very good chance you would have died at that point

00:32:09.300 --> 00:32:11.020
 'cause it's such a blast of searing heat

00:32:11.020 --> 00:32:13.300
 for such a, for a relatively long time.

00:32:13.300 --> 00:32:14.740
 Longer than you'd be comfortable with.

00:32:14.740 --> 00:32:15.900
 - It's not just like a sauna.

00:32:15.900 --> 00:32:16.740
 - No, it's just--

00:32:16.740 --> 00:32:18.820
 (all laughing)

00:32:18.820 --> 00:32:20.060
 - For a brief moment in time,

00:32:20.060 --> 00:32:21.540
 the muscles were very relaxed.

00:32:21.540 --> 00:32:24.060
 (all laughing)

00:32:24.060 --> 00:32:26.020
 - It is nuts reading about it.

00:32:26.020 --> 00:32:26.860
 - Yeah.

00:32:26.860 --> 00:32:27.700
 - I mean, it was pretty striking.

00:32:27.700 --> 00:32:28.860
 - It was a big old rock, wasn't it?

00:32:28.860 --> 00:32:29.700
 - A big old rock.

00:32:29.700 --> 00:32:33.340
 I found one weird thing, this slide.

00:32:33.340 --> 00:32:34.740
 Right, so I think we've said before,

00:32:34.740 --> 00:32:37.140
 it was the size of Mount Everest, the rock there.

00:32:37.140 --> 00:32:39.220
 And it was traveling 20 times the speed of a bullet.

00:32:39.220 --> 00:32:41.780
 It was really, really huge.

00:32:41.780 --> 00:32:42.620
 - Big and fast.

00:32:42.620 --> 00:32:43.780
 - Big and fast.

00:32:43.780 --> 00:32:47.540
 And it was so big and fast that when it arrived,

00:32:47.540 --> 00:32:50.240
 it was pushing the atmosphere in front of it so rapidly

00:32:50.240 --> 00:32:52.960
 that the crater from the impact started to form

00:32:52.960 --> 00:32:53.940
 before it hit.

00:32:53.940 --> 00:32:54.780
 - Oh yeah.

00:32:54.780 --> 00:32:57.460
 - It just pushed the surface of the earth down.

00:32:57.460 --> 00:32:59.620
 - Oh my God, it's amazing, that, isn't it?

00:32:59.620 --> 00:33:01.020
 - Yeah, it's insane.

00:33:01.020 --> 00:33:04.420
 I became friends recently with the dinosaur hunter,

00:33:04.420 --> 00:33:06.220
 who, well, she's a paleontologist,

00:33:06.220 --> 00:33:08.380
 who's the person who has verified

00:33:08.380 --> 00:33:11.260
 that the asteroid landed in spring.

00:33:11.260 --> 00:33:13.620
 I think you guys met her very briefly in Belgium.

00:33:13.620 --> 00:33:14.440
 - Oh yeah.

00:33:14.440 --> 00:33:16.580
 - When we were at Nerdland, at the festival.

00:33:16.580 --> 00:33:18.460
 It was all to do with the specific fish

00:33:18.460 --> 00:33:20.820
 that as it was being carried in the tsunamis,

00:33:20.820 --> 00:33:22.460
 which was not just water, it was also earth,

00:33:22.460 --> 00:33:24.340
 like an earth tsunami.

00:33:24.340 --> 00:33:28.020
 The glass that had come down went into,

00:33:28.020 --> 00:33:29.340
 through the filters of the fish,

00:33:29.340 --> 00:33:30.860
 like went through the mouth and were inside.

00:33:30.860 --> 00:33:33.260
 So when they found the fossilized versions of these fish,

00:33:33.260 --> 00:33:34.140
 they found the glass.

00:33:34.140 --> 00:33:36.380
 And these specific fish are the type of fish

00:33:36.380 --> 00:33:39.380
 that have growths in their body that change per season.

00:33:39.380 --> 00:33:40.720
 - Oh, that's so handy.

00:33:40.720 --> 00:33:42.860
 - So during spring, yeah.

00:33:42.860 --> 00:33:45.980
 So during spring, they grow these extra little things.

00:33:45.980 --> 00:33:47.260
 So they spotted that and they went,

00:33:47.260 --> 00:33:48.740
 well, that could only happen in spring.

00:33:48.740 --> 00:33:51.420
 Therefore, in spring on the side of the planet that it's on,

00:33:51.420 --> 00:33:52.260
 that's where that happened.

00:33:52.260 --> 00:33:53.100
 - That is amazing.

00:33:53.100 --> 00:33:53.940
 - Really nuts.

00:33:53.940 --> 00:33:54.780
 - It is nuts.

00:33:54.780 --> 00:33:55.620
 - That's hot.

00:33:55.620 --> 00:33:56.460
 You know, you're gonna deal with an asteroid

00:33:56.460 --> 00:33:58.160
 and hay fever at the same time.

00:33:58.160 --> 00:34:00.580
 (all laughing)

00:34:00.580 --> 00:34:04.620
 I was looking at extinct meat,

00:34:04.620 --> 00:34:08.100
 'cause a cultivated meat company in Australia

00:34:08.100 --> 00:34:10.580
 made a mammoth meatball last year.

00:34:10.580 --> 00:34:12.660
 - Oh, yes, I heard about this, yeah.

00:34:12.660 --> 00:34:17.020
 - Using a DNA sequence from the mammoth myoglobin,

00:34:17.020 --> 00:34:19.660
 which is the protein that gives the meat its flavor,

00:34:19.660 --> 00:34:22.740
 and filled in a few gaps using elephant DNA,

00:34:22.740 --> 00:34:24.220
 and then they made this meatball.

00:34:24.220 --> 00:34:25.780
 They did not eat the meatball.

00:34:25.780 --> 00:34:26.620
 - Really?

00:34:26.620 --> 00:34:28.500
 - They just put it on display to be like,

00:34:28.500 --> 00:34:29.420
 this is a mammoth meatball.

00:34:29.420 --> 00:34:31.020
 I don't know, I think they were just,

00:34:31.020 --> 00:34:32.740
 they were like, we haven't really tested this,

00:34:32.740 --> 00:34:35.180
 whether this is safe for human consumption.

00:34:35.180 --> 00:34:36.020
 - Oh, really?

00:34:36.020 --> 00:34:37.100
 - So we'll just make the meatball,

00:34:37.100 --> 00:34:38.900
 I guess, probably to get a bit of press.

00:34:38.900 --> 00:34:40.860
 - Is it the size of a normal meatball?

00:34:40.860 --> 00:34:42.540
 'Cause you think if it was a mammoth meatball,

00:34:42.540 --> 00:34:44.060
 you would deliberately make it much bigger,

00:34:44.060 --> 00:34:44.900
 wouldn't you?

00:34:44.900 --> 00:34:45.740
 - Yeah, exactly.

00:34:45.740 --> 00:34:48.340
 - I didn't get, it wasn't next to like a can of Coke,

00:34:48.340 --> 00:34:49.180
 so I'm not sure.

00:34:49.180 --> 00:34:50.460
 (laughing)

00:34:50.460 --> 00:34:52.780
 - But it loves regular meatball science.

00:34:52.780 --> 00:34:55.260
 - Maybe you wouldn't, 'cause then it would just confuse

00:34:55.260 --> 00:34:57.180
 the purchaser or the person looking at it,

00:34:57.180 --> 00:34:58.660
 go, oh, I get it, it's mammoth, it's big.

00:34:58.660 --> 00:35:00.340
 It's like, we're just not even considering

00:35:00.340 --> 00:35:03.740
 the extraordinary science that has got into this.

00:35:03.740 --> 00:35:05.060
 - I would have eaten that.

00:35:05.060 --> 00:35:05.900
 - You wouldn't?

00:35:05.900 --> 00:35:08.620
 - Without knowing the health implications.

00:35:08.620 --> 00:35:10.460
 - It's interesting.

00:35:10.460 --> 00:35:13.620
 - Okay, but I feel like they've grown it.

00:35:13.620 --> 00:35:15.100
 No animals have been harmed.

00:35:15.100 --> 00:35:15.940
 - Yeah.

00:35:15.940 --> 00:35:17.780
 - So I'm a veggie, but I would love to.

00:35:17.780 --> 00:35:19.740
 - Yes, I think the same thing,

00:35:19.740 --> 00:35:21.980
 'cause my boyfriend's vegetarian and he says

00:35:21.980 --> 00:35:24.380
 that if we reached the point where we could just have

00:35:24.380 --> 00:35:26.820
 cultivated meat made from the actual cells,

00:35:26.820 --> 00:35:28.260
 then he'd go, oh, it's fine, I'll eat that.

00:35:28.260 --> 00:35:33.260
 And I think it's come a long way in the last few years.

00:35:33.260 --> 00:35:36.380
 I think the first patty they made,

00:35:36.380 --> 00:35:38.740
 like a mince patty, a salad just with mince patties,

00:35:38.740 --> 00:35:43.100
 was I think $300,000, so quite an expensive burger.

00:35:43.100 --> 00:35:44.700
 But it's come down now where they think

00:35:44.700 --> 00:35:46.340
 that they could, you know, release these things.

00:35:46.340 --> 00:35:47.180
 - To like 200,000.

00:35:47.180 --> 00:35:48.020
 - Yeah.

00:35:48.020 --> 00:35:51.300
 - Release them into supermarkets, so it's rapidly.

00:35:51.300 --> 00:35:52.780
 - I experimented quite a lot with those.

00:35:52.780 --> 00:35:53.860
 I tried some salmon the other day,

00:35:53.860 --> 00:35:55.940
 which I have to say was not there.

00:35:55.940 --> 00:35:57.580
 - Oh yeah, it's like the fake salmon.

00:35:57.580 --> 00:35:58.420
 - I'm saying it's not to do.

00:35:58.420 --> 00:36:00.100
 - It's not the like made from actual.

00:36:00.100 --> 00:36:01.620
 - I'm sorry, yeah, that's fine.

00:36:01.620 --> 00:36:03.140
 - I think they just keep adding salt

00:36:03.140 --> 00:36:06.580
 until it has some kind of flavor that explains.

00:36:06.580 --> 00:36:09.380
 - I had a vegan Domino's pepperoni pizza

00:36:09.380 --> 00:36:11.860
 a couple of nights ago, that's not an ad.

00:36:11.860 --> 00:36:13.900
 And I could not taste the difference.

00:36:13.900 --> 00:36:14.740
 - Really?

00:36:14.740 --> 00:36:15.580
 - Genuinely could not taste the difference.

00:36:15.580 --> 00:36:16.660
 - I will just say for the listeners at home,

00:36:16.660 --> 00:36:18.820
 he does have a Domino's tetu or something.

00:36:18.820 --> 00:36:19.660
 (all laughing)

00:36:19.660 --> 00:36:20.500
 - He's trying to show off.

00:36:20.500 --> 00:36:21.660
 - He's wearing two watches,

00:36:21.660 --> 00:36:23.780
 one of which seems to be a Domino's pizza.

00:36:23.780 --> 00:36:24.620
 - Yeah, what's that?

00:36:24.620 --> 00:36:25.540
 Oh, pizza time.

00:36:25.540 --> 00:36:27.500
 (all laughing)

00:36:27.500 --> 00:36:29.620
 - Can I ask, did it have cheese on it?

00:36:29.620 --> 00:36:30.940
 - It did, well, no, but it had vegan cheese.

00:36:30.940 --> 00:36:31.780
 - It has vegan cheese on it.

00:36:31.780 --> 00:36:32.620
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:36:32.620 --> 00:36:33.980
 - It's a vegan pizza, yeah.

00:36:33.980 --> 00:36:35.860
 - They used to have a vegan pizzerics,

00:36:35.860 --> 00:36:37.740
 but seeing as we're talking about pizzas now,

00:36:37.740 --> 00:36:39.100
 they used to have a vegan pizzerics best

00:36:39.100 --> 00:36:39.940
 down the road from here,

00:36:39.940 --> 00:36:42.100
 which only sold vegan pizzas.

00:36:42.100 --> 00:36:44.900
 And it was the most disgusting thing though.

00:36:44.900 --> 00:36:47.660
 - The cheese, like they just couldn't do good vegan cheese.

00:36:47.660 --> 00:36:48.500
 Maybe they can now.

00:36:48.500 --> 00:36:50.540
 - It's all about the mouthfeel.

00:36:50.540 --> 00:36:52.420
 - That's the, and the stretch.

00:36:52.420 --> 00:36:53.740
 - That's your tinder bio.

00:36:53.740 --> 00:36:56.060
 (all laughing)

00:36:56.060 --> 00:36:57.740
 - The mouthfeeling, the stretch.

00:36:57.740 --> 00:36:59.940
 (all laughing)

00:36:59.940 --> 00:37:02.060
 - I found an essay in a scientific journal

00:37:02.060 --> 00:37:04.020
 called Evolution, Education and Outreach,

00:37:04.020 --> 00:37:07.620
 and it asked, which items a Jewish time traveler

00:37:07.620 --> 00:37:09.980
 would be able to eat because they were kosher or not?

00:37:09.980 --> 00:37:10.820
 - Yeah, okay.

00:37:10.820 --> 00:37:12.860
 - Can you guess the headline of this article?

00:37:12.860 --> 00:37:15.540
 - 50 points to anyone who does, is gettable.

00:37:15.540 --> 00:37:17.020
 - Oh, is it a pun?

00:37:17.020 --> 00:37:18.220
 Back to the juicer.

00:37:18.220 --> 00:37:20.060
 - The juicer, that's not that.

00:37:20.060 --> 00:37:20.900
 So it's about the food.

00:37:20.900 --> 00:37:23.380
 It's about the food that you might be eating.

00:37:23.380 --> 00:37:26.100
 - Is it to do with time travel?

00:37:26.100 --> 00:37:27.940
 - It's to do with a very famous

00:37:27.940 --> 00:37:29.580
 dinosaur-based franchise.

00:37:29.580 --> 00:37:30.620
 (all laughing)

00:37:30.620 --> 00:37:31.460
 - Jurassic pork.

00:37:31.460 --> 00:37:32.300
 - Jurassic pork.

00:37:32.300 --> 00:37:33.620
 (all exclaiming)

00:37:33.620 --> 00:37:34.460
 - Beautiful.

00:37:34.460 --> 00:37:35.300
 - Jurassic pork.

00:37:35.300 --> 00:37:36.140
 - Beautiful.

00:37:36.140 --> 00:37:38.260
 - And it was, that's a good headline.

00:37:38.260 --> 00:37:39.100
 - Yeah, that's good.

00:37:39.100 --> 00:37:42.220
 - And it was about what basically a Jewish time traveler

00:37:42.220 --> 00:37:43.860
 who wanted to eat contemporaneous food

00:37:43.860 --> 00:37:44.700
 would be allowed to eat.

00:37:44.700 --> 00:37:46.980
 And basically very few dinosaurs are kosher,

00:37:46.980 --> 00:37:47.820
 it turns out.

00:37:47.820 --> 00:37:48.660
 - Oh, wow.

00:37:48.660 --> 00:37:49.940
 - Some of them are birds.

00:37:49.940 --> 00:37:52.980
 But even the bird ones lack the sort of toe

00:37:52.980 --> 00:37:54.260
 that you have to, if you're allowed to eat

00:37:54.260 --> 00:37:55.500
 particular meats that are kosher,

00:37:55.500 --> 00:37:57.180
 it's 'cause they're like chicken.

00:37:57.180 --> 00:37:59.460
 They've got a particular opposable toe, I think.

00:37:59.460 --> 00:38:00.600
 - Right.

00:38:00.600 --> 00:38:01.780
 - Mice are not allowed.

00:38:01.780 --> 00:38:03.140
 That's probably not relevant now.

00:38:03.140 --> 00:38:05.620
 - So sorry, Jew-rasic pork.

00:38:05.620 --> 00:38:06.980
 - They actually just went with Jurassic.

00:38:06.980 --> 00:38:08.300
 - They just went with Jurassic?

00:38:08.300 --> 00:38:09.140
 - Yeah.

00:38:09.140 --> 00:38:10.620
 - What, Jew-rasic pork?

00:38:10.620 --> 00:38:12.460
 - I think they were correct in that.

00:38:12.460 --> 00:38:15.740
 I think Jurassic pork is...

00:38:15.740 --> 00:38:17.540
 - It's sitting there.

00:38:17.540 --> 00:38:18.380
 - Yeah, I guess so.

00:38:18.380 --> 00:38:19.540
 - It's like a complaints letter.

00:38:19.540 --> 00:38:21.660
 (laughing)

00:38:21.660 --> 00:38:24.940
 - We said earlier, 65, 66 million years ago

00:38:24.940 --> 00:38:26.420
 with the extinction of the dinosaurs.

00:38:26.420 --> 00:38:27.820
 - Sure.

00:38:27.820 --> 00:38:31.820
 - But do you know how long ago that is in a galactic year?

00:38:31.820 --> 00:38:32.740
 - Ooh.

00:38:32.740 --> 00:38:34.340
 - I'd never heard of a galactic year before.

00:38:34.340 --> 00:38:37.060
 - There must be something to do with the traveling

00:38:37.060 --> 00:38:37.900
 through the galaxy.

00:38:37.900 --> 00:38:40.220
 - Yeah, so how long it takes the galaxy to go on once?

00:38:40.220 --> 00:38:41.060
 - Exactly.

00:38:41.060 --> 00:38:42.740
 - I think it's three years ago in galaxy years.

00:38:42.740 --> 00:38:46.740
 - Galactic year is 225 million years, roughly.

00:38:46.740 --> 00:38:47.580
 - Sort of 10.

00:38:47.580 --> 00:38:48.420
 - Yeah.

00:38:48.420 --> 00:38:49.260
 - Incorrect.

00:38:49.260 --> 00:38:50.100
 - Really?

00:38:50.100 --> 00:38:52.540
 - So the dinosaurs were here 3.5 months ago.

00:38:52.540 --> 00:38:53.380
 - Oh wow.

00:38:53.380 --> 00:38:54.220
 - In a galactic year.

00:38:54.220 --> 00:38:56.180
 - The dinosaurs were on Earth,

00:38:56.180 --> 00:38:58.060
 but if you had a time machine,

00:38:58.060 --> 00:39:00.300
 like, you know what does Doctor Who have?

00:39:00.300 --> 00:39:02.620
 It's like a TARDIS, yeah.

00:39:02.620 --> 00:39:04.020
 You go into the TARDIS

00:39:04.020 --> 00:39:07.460
 and you come back exactly in the same position in space,

00:39:07.460 --> 00:39:10.420
 but different time, the Earth won't be here anymore.

00:39:10.420 --> 00:39:11.700
 - Yeah, we'll be further in space.

00:39:11.700 --> 00:39:12.540
 - Yeah.

00:39:12.540 --> 00:39:13.380
 - Yeah, so you have to-

00:39:13.380 --> 00:39:15.580
 - And if Doctor Who was going through-

00:39:15.580 --> 00:39:17.820
 (laughing)

00:39:17.820 --> 00:39:19.300
 - Sorry, I was just trying to appeal.

00:39:19.300 --> 00:39:21.580
 (laughing)

00:39:21.580 --> 00:39:22.740
 - Oh my goodness.

00:39:22.740 --> 00:39:23.580
 - Yeah.

00:39:23.580 --> 00:39:26.160
 (upbeat music)

00:39:26.160 --> 00:39:31.140
 - Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show.

00:39:31.140 --> 00:39:32.420
 And that is my fact.

00:39:32.420 --> 00:39:34.860
 My fact this week is that in the 1980s,

00:39:34.860 --> 00:39:38.060
 you could download video games over the radio.

00:39:38.060 --> 00:39:38.900
 - Okay.

00:39:38.900 --> 00:39:39.740
 - What?

00:39:39.740 --> 00:39:40.580
 - Yeah.

00:39:40.580 --> 00:39:41.400
 - What?

00:39:41.400 --> 00:39:42.500
 - To a certain generation, that's gonna be like,

00:39:42.500 --> 00:39:44.660
 there used to be a thing called MySpace.

00:39:44.660 --> 00:39:45.500
 - Yeah.

00:39:45.500 --> 00:39:46.340
 (laughing)

00:39:46.340 --> 00:39:47.180
 - Have you heard of DVDs?

00:39:47.180 --> 00:39:49.420
 - I was alive in the 1980s and I never heard that.

00:39:49.420 --> 00:39:51.580
 - Yeah, no, I didn't think of this either.

00:39:51.580 --> 00:39:53.540
 This was the very early days of computers

00:39:53.540 --> 00:39:56.340
 whereby hard drives were incredibly expensive.

00:39:56.340 --> 00:39:58.580
 So they used to have an audio cassette,

00:39:58.580 --> 00:39:59.780
 like you would in a stereo.

00:39:59.780 --> 00:40:00.980
 You could put a cassette in

00:40:00.980 --> 00:40:02.660
 and that's where you would keep all the data

00:40:02.660 --> 00:40:04.540
 of programs that you were loading up.

00:40:04.540 --> 00:40:07.300
 So someone made the connection that actually,

00:40:07.300 --> 00:40:09.060
 if you're able to record onto a cassette,

00:40:09.060 --> 00:40:10.700
 you should be able to transfer

00:40:10.700 --> 00:40:13.940
 multiple different kinds of data over the radio.

00:40:13.940 --> 00:40:15.180
 And why not video games?

00:40:15.180 --> 00:40:17.580
 So what people used to do is they used to tune in

00:40:17.580 --> 00:40:22.040
 to radio shows that basically just played data over the waves.

00:40:22.040 --> 00:40:24.700
 You'd put your cassette in and you would press record

00:40:24.700 --> 00:40:26.100
 and then you take it out, put it in your computer

00:40:26.100 --> 00:40:26.940
 and there's your video game.

00:40:26.940 --> 00:40:28.460
 - So these were dedicated radio stations

00:40:28.460 --> 00:40:30.540
 and wasn't like, that was talking here.

00:40:30.540 --> 00:40:32.140
 (laughing)

00:40:32.140 --> 00:40:33.860
 - It was now time for Tetris.

00:40:33.860 --> 00:40:38.300
 So what did the audio sound like?

00:40:38.300 --> 00:40:41.700
 - Well, for people probably older than you,

00:40:41.700 --> 00:40:43.540
 but younger than me, it would sound like,

00:40:43.540 --> 00:40:46.020
 you know, when you had dial-up internet

00:40:46.020 --> 00:40:49.180
 and a fax came through on a phone line,

00:40:49.180 --> 00:40:50.020
 it's just like...

00:40:50.020 --> 00:40:53.660
 Yeah, it's exactly that.

00:40:53.660 --> 00:40:55.260
 - And the computer just takes that

00:40:55.260 --> 00:40:57.300
 and if it's a high sound, it's a one

00:40:57.300 --> 00:40:58.940
 and if it's a low sound, it's a zero

00:40:58.940 --> 00:41:00.620
 and it just turns it into zeros and ones

00:41:00.620 --> 00:41:01.460
 and makes games out of it.

00:41:01.460 --> 00:41:03.840
 - Yeah, and to be fair, that could be confused

00:41:03.840 --> 00:41:05.500
 as a very popular type of...

00:41:05.500 --> 00:41:06.340
 - Yes, exactly.

00:41:06.340 --> 00:41:07.180
 - Techno.

00:41:07.180 --> 00:41:09.380
 (laughing)

00:41:09.380 --> 00:41:11.300
 Yeah, so this was done for ages

00:41:11.300 --> 00:41:14.140
 and then suddenly, obviously modern technology

00:41:14.140 --> 00:41:15.940
 and prices, you know, the equivalent

00:41:15.940 --> 00:41:18.860
 of the Mammoth Berger coming down from 300,000,

00:41:18.860 --> 00:41:21.260
 they suddenly were able to afford to have hard drives

00:41:21.260 --> 00:41:23.560
 and computers and so it slowly got wiped out.

00:41:23.560 --> 00:41:25.900
 But yeah, that was the thing that happened.

00:41:25.900 --> 00:41:30.340
 It's bizarre to think that you could take a video game,

00:41:30.340 --> 00:41:32.940
 Grand Theft Auto, by just listening to the radio

00:41:32.940 --> 00:41:34.460
 and recording it.

00:41:34.460 --> 00:41:36.620
 I'm not used to the idea that data could be transmitted

00:41:36.620 --> 00:41:38.580
 in ways that we can hear and understand.

00:41:38.580 --> 00:41:41.180
 - It's so strong, yes, yeah.

00:41:41.180 --> 00:41:42.620
 - And obviously data could be transmitted

00:41:42.620 --> 00:41:43.860
 in ways we can hear and understand

00:41:43.860 --> 00:41:47.260
 'cause I'm talking to you all as I understand.

00:41:47.260 --> 00:41:49.740
 But yeah, yeah, and there was weird things

00:41:49.740 --> 00:41:53.060
 that were done using this kind of novelty, I guess it was,

00:41:53.060 --> 00:41:54.940
 Radio West, do you ever hear of Radio West?

00:41:54.940 --> 00:41:56.900
 I think it's BBC and they just called it Radio West.

00:41:56.900 --> 00:41:58.900
 So it's sort of you get your local BBC in an area.

00:41:58.900 --> 00:42:01.660
 There used to be a host who was called,

00:42:01.660 --> 00:42:04.300
 ooh, what was he called?

00:42:04.300 --> 00:42:06.100
 Sorry, hang on a sec.

00:42:06.100 --> 00:42:07.660
 There used to be a host called Joe Tozzer,

00:42:07.660 --> 00:42:09.220
 who used to work for--

00:42:09.220 --> 00:42:10.060
 (laughing)

00:42:10.060 --> 00:42:11.500
 - How did you forget that name?

00:42:11.500 --> 00:42:13.580
 (laughing)

00:42:13.580 --> 00:42:14.740
 - And then at number six this week,

00:42:14.740 --> 00:42:16.380
 Joe Tozzer and the master-paters.

00:42:16.380 --> 00:42:18.640
 (laughing)

00:42:18.640 --> 00:42:21.740
 - So funny.

00:42:21.740 --> 00:42:23.980
 (laughing)

00:42:23.980 --> 00:42:27.700
 - Sorry, Joe, if you're listening.

00:42:27.700 --> 00:42:29.500
 But also, how was school?

00:42:29.500 --> 00:42:31.260
 Was that, that was a rough one.

00:42:31.260 --> 00:42:32.100
 - How do you spell it?

00:42:32.100 --> 00:42:33.180
 - It could be Tozzer.

00:42:33.180 --> 00:42:34.020
 - Tozzer, yeah.

00:42:34.020 --> 00:42:35.860
 - I'm sure he says Tozzer.

00:42:35.860 --> 00:42:38.020
 - I was in "Fade Tozzer" from Steps.

00:42:38.020 --> 00:42:38.860
 - Okay.

00:42:38.860 --> 00:42:39.700
 - We're a piece of good together,

00:42:39.700 --> 00:42:40.700
 it was definitely a different name for that.

00:42:40.700 --> 00:42:41.540
 - Tozzer.

00:42:41.540 --> 00:42:42.380
 - Yeah, he are.

00:42:42.380 --> 00:42:43.220
 - Oh yeah, Tozzer.

00:42:43.220 --> 00:42:44.540
 - You said he went with Tozzer.

00:42:44.540 --> 00:42:46.780
 (laughing)

00:42:46.780 --> 00:42:49.700
 - Sorry, Joe.

00:42:49.700 --> 00:42:54.180
 - But yeah, so he once broadcast the data sounds

00:42:54.180 --> 00:42:56.100
 of what ended up being a pixel image

00:42:56.100 --> 00:42:58.220
 of one of Charlie's Angels Angels.

00:42:58.220 --> 00:42:59.980
 So the star Sheryl Land.

00:42:59.980 --> 00:43:01.820
 So you recorded it down, put it into your computer

00:43:01.820 --> 00:43:04.460
 and slowly it pixelated together,

00:43:04.460 --> 00:43:07.340
 40 by 80 pixels of the star.

00:43:07.340 --> 00:43:08.180
 - 40 by 80.

00:43:08.180 --> 00:43:09.020
 - 40 by 80.

00:43:09.020 --> 00:43:10.900
 - It's actually resolution, it is.

00:43:10.900 --> 00:43:11.980
 - Is that a boob or a head?

00:43:11.980 --> 00:43:14.240
 (laughing)

00:43:14.240 --> 00:43:20.620
 - And of course you could do it with vinyl as well.

00:43:20.620 --> 00:43:23.660
 And there was some computer game magazines

00:43:23.660 --> 00:43:24.980
 that would put little vinyls

00:43:24.980 --> 00:43:26.700
 on front of the magazine.

00:43:26.700 --> 00:43:29.140
 And it would just play this noise

00:43:29.140 --> 00:43:32.940
 which your computer then would recognize as zeros and ones

00:43:32.940 --> 00:43:35.100
 and would turn into a game.

00:43:35.100 --> 00:43:36.420
 It's all 'cause you didn't have enough memory

00:43:36.420 --> 00:43:37.260
 on your computer.

00:43:37.260 --> 00:43:38.340
 - It's exactly that, yeah.

00:43:38.340 --> 00:43:40.380
 - So your memory had to be on your cassette.

00:43:40.380 --> 00:43:41.220
 - Yeah.

00:43:41.220 --> 00:43:42.660
 - What are the limitations of it now?

00:43:42.660 --> 00:43:47.660
 So in theory, could we do it for a more complex game

00:43:47.660 --> 00:43:49.500
 than Tetris or Pong or--

00:43:49.500 --> 00:43:51.020
 - You could for sure, I reckon.

00:43:51.020 --> 00:43:51.980
 But the problem is,

00:43:51.980 --> 00:43:53.380
 'cause I used to have one of these computers

00:43:53.380 --> 00:43:54.540
 with the cassettes on,

00:43:54.540 --> 00:43:56.180
 it would take about 30 minutes

00:43:56.180 --> 00:43:58.260
 to load any game onto your computer.

00:43:58.260 --> 00:44:01.220
 And they were all really shit games.

00:44:01.220 --> 00:44:04.700
 They were fun, but the graphics were terrible and whatever.

00:44:04.700 --> 00:44:07.340
 And often you would get to the end of the 30 minutes

00:44:07.340 --> 00:44:10.220
 and one of its zeros or ones would have been read wrong

00:44:10.220 --> 00:44:11.940
 and the whole thing would be knackered.

00:44:11.940 --> 00:44:13.580
 You'd have to start again.

00:44:13.580 --> 00:44:16.580
 And so if you wanted to put like Grand Theft Auto

00:44:16.580 --> 00:44:19.060
 on today, you'd probably have to make it play

00:44:19.060 --> 00:44:20.300
 for about 40 years.

00:44:20.300 --> 00:44:21.640
 - Yeah, okay, all right.

00:44:21.640 --> 00:44:22.480
 - That would be great to know

00:44:22.480 --> 00:44:23.460
 'cause the game is so massive.

00:44:23.460 --> 00:44:24.740
 You're a gamer, aren't you?

00:44:24.740 --> 00:44:27.020
 - I'm a little bit of a gamer, yes.

00:44:27.020 --> 00:44:31.220
 Can we get Baldur's Gate 3 in audio form?

00:44:31.220 --> 00:44:34.660
 - They did end up releasing very specific audio blank cassettes

00:44:34.660 --> 00:44:36.980
 that you could get called basic code.

00:44:36.980 --> 00:44:40.980
 So it would guarantee compatibility with your computer

00:44:40.980 --> 00:44:43.140
 as opposed to I imagine there were a few audio cassettes

00:44:43.140 --> 00:44:45.100
 out there that didn't quite do it.

00:44:45.100 --> 00:44:47.420
 And so, yeah, you would tune into either like DataRama

00:44:47.420 --> 00:44:50.220
 or HobbyScoop, which were specific radio stations

00:44:50.220 --> 00:44:51.060
 that-- - That's amazing.

00:44:51.060 --> 00:44:54.140
 - But you can just put on Radio 4

00:44:54.140 --> 00:44:55.540
 and listen to the shipping forecast

00:44:55.540 --> 00:44:56.900
 and make that into your own game.

00:44:56.900 --> 00:44:58.220
 I find, you know.

00:44:58.220 --> 00:45:01.100
 - We used to do this as kids, actually.

00:45:01.100 --> 00:45:04.060
 And we would have to guess whether it was rising slowly

00:45:04.060 --> 00:45:05.980
 or, you know, I don't know if it's the pressure

00:45:05.980 --> 00:45:10.420
 or something, they go, "Dogger 75, rising slowly."

00:45:10.420 --> 00:45:11.940
 We had to guess what it was gonna be.

00:45:11.940 --> 00:45:12.780
 - That's good.

00:45:12.780 --> 00:45:14.900
 Who's the host of the shipping forecast?

00:45:14.900 --> 00:45:16.260
 - I don't think it's got a host per se.

00:45:16.260 --> 00:45:17.940
 - Well, the person who reads--

00:45:17.940 --> 00:45:18.780
 - I don't know.

00:45:18.780 --> 00:45:19.620
 - I can't remember.

00:45:19.620 --> 00:45:20.940
 I think it's been the same person for about 40 years.

00:45:20.940 --> 00:45:21.780
 - She's very famous.

00:45:21.780 --> 00:45:23.940
 Yeah, she's married, I think, to Claire Bolding.

00:45:23.940 --> 00:45:26.500
 She, I was on a show with her once

00:45:26.500 --> 00:45:29.980
 and I was asked, "Do you wanna have any questions for her

00:45:29.980 --> 00:45:31.860
 "about the shipping forecast?"

00:45:31.860 --> 00:45:33.780
 I didn't know what to ask 'cause I'd never heard it.

00:45:33.780 --> 00:45:36.180
 So I said, "What's your favorite ship?"

00:45:36.180 --> 00:45:38.620
 (laughing)

00:45:38.620 --> 00:45:40.340
 That's a good question.

00:45:40.340 --> 00:45:41.420
 - It's a good question.

00:45:41.420 --> 00:45:42.740
 Did she have an answer?

00:45:42.740 --> 00:45:45.300
 - No, she was like, "You haven't heard my show, have you?"

00:45:45.300 --> 00:45:47.620
 I said, "No, I haven't, food."

00:45:47.620 --> 00:45:49.100
 - And she said, "What's your favorite fish?"

00:45:49.100 --> 00:45:50.420
 - Yeah.

00:45:50.420 --> 00:45:53.180
 - Did you hear of the game Great Britain Limited?

00:45:53.180 --> 00:45:55.580
 I was looking at some early spectrum games.

00:45:55.580 --> 00:45:56.900
 - No.

00:45:56.900 --> 00:45:58.300
 - In Great Britain Limited,

00:45:58.300 --> 00:46:00.780
 it was a government simulation

00:46:00.780 --> 00:46:04.060
 where you managed the British economy and--

00:46:04.060 --> 00:46:05.380
 - I love it.

00:46:05.380 --> 00:46:06.220
 - Wow.

00:46:06.220 --> 00:46:07.220
 - There's no way to win.

00:46:07.220 --> 00:46:09.060
 - It was very--

00:46:09.060 --> 00:46:10.060
 - Did they give Lys Trassa a go there?

00:46:10.060 --> 00:46:12.540
 (laughing)

00:46:12.540 --> 00:46:13.540
 - This was easy.

00:46:13.540 --> 00:46:16.020
 (laughing)

00:46:16.020 --> 00:46:18.060
 - Yeah, you would like change little things

00:46:18.060 --> 00:46:19.540
 and then the inflation would go up

00:46:19.540 --> 00:46:22.820
 or the unemployment would go down or vice versa.

00:46:22.820 --> 00:46:24.820
 And then every five years you would have an election

00:46:24.820 --> 00:46:26.660
 and depending on how well you've done,

00:46:26.660 --> 00:46:28.940
 it would say you've been kicked out

00:46:28.940 --> 00:46:30.340
 or you've got another five years.

00:46:30.340 --> 00:46:32.300
 - Wow, that is so funny.

00:46:32.300 --> 00:46:33.580
 That's really good.

00:46:33.580 --> 00:46:34.420
 What was that?

00:46:34.420 --> 00:46:36.140
 - '80s, yeah, early '80s.

00:46:36.140 --> 00:46:37.500
 - Wow, and it was government-made?

00:46:37.500 --> 00:46:38.660
 - No, it was just--

00:46:38.660 --> 00:46:39.500
 - Oh, okay.

00:46:39.500 --> 00:46:40.940
 - A lot of these games in the '80s,

00:46:40.940 --> 00:46:43.660
 they were just made by kids in the bedrooms.

00:46:43.660 --> 00:46:45.380
 - Yeah, which was mad.

00:46:45.380 --> 00:46:48.820
 I went over to the home of a rider friend of my other friends

00:46:48.820 --> 00:46:50.140
 and she was like, "I want you to meet him.

00:46:50.140 --> 00:46:50.980
 "He's really cool."

00:46:50.980 --> 00:46:53.180
 We went over and he just pulled out a whole archive

00:46:53.180 --> 00:46:55.500
 of cassettes of games he invented.

00:46:55.500 --> 00:46:56.340
 - Wow.

00:46:56.340 --> 00:46:58.380
 - Yeah, and that was the first time I ever learned

00:46:58.380 --> 00:47:00.300
 that games could be put on an audio cassette.

00:47:00.300 --> 00:47:02.940
 - It was a good time for creativity,

00:47:02.940 --> 00:47:04.700
 but just in a very shitty medium.

00:47:04.700 --> 00:47:06.540
 (laughing)

00:47:06.540 --> 00:47:08.100
 - Much like the podcast.

00:47:08.100 --> 00:47:10.340
 (laughing)

00:47:10.340 --> 00:47:13.500
 Do you have any really weird games, Mel?

00:47:13.500 --> 00:47:15.500
 - Do I have any weird games at one point?

00:47:15.500 --> 00:47:17.660
 'Cause I have quite an addictive personality

00:47:17.660 --> 00:47:18.700
 when it comes to games.

00:47:18.700 --> 00:47:22.500
 There is a very stupid game on Steam called Cookie Clicker.

00:47:22.500 --> 00:47:25.460
 And it's literally a cookie and you just click it

00:47:25.460 --> 00:47:26.860
 and you get another cookie.

00:47:26.860 --> 00:47:30.020
 But then you keep clicking and then you can buy

00:47:30.020 --> 00:47:33.460
 like a cafe that makes cookies.

00:47:33.460 --> 00:47:35.260
 So you just, it's basic.

00:47:35.260 --> 00:47:37.660
 I feel like it feeds the endorphins in your brain

00:47:37.660 --> 00:47:39.180
 because you just like keep clicking

00:47:39.180 --> 00:47:41.220
 and then you can buy like an automatic clicker

00:47:41.220 --> 00:47:43.740
 with the cookies and then it will automatically

00:47:43.740 --> 00:47:44.580
 click it for you.

00:47:44.580 --> 00:47:47.180
 And then you can buy a factory of cookies.

00:47:47.180 --> 00:47:48.580
 And you keep, and it's-

00:47:48.580 --> 00:47:49.660
 - But you have to keep clicking.

00:47:49.660 --> 00:47:52.100
 - But you could leave it for like an hour

00:47:52.100 --> 00:47:54.460
 because you've run an automated system.

00:47:54.460 --> 00:47:55.740
 And then you come back and you're like,

00:47:55.740 --> 00:47:57.660
 I've got four billion cookies.

00:47:57.660 --> 00:48:00.580
 And it just feeds the endorphins in your brain

00:48:00.580 --> 00:48:01.740
 because you're like, I'm doing,

00:48:01.740 --> 00:48:03.220
 I'm getting better at this game.

00:48:03.220 --> 00:48:04.820
 - Do you say it's on Steam?

00:48:04.820 --> 00:48:05.860
 - It's on Steam, a lot of that.

00:48:05.860 --> 00:48:06.700
 - What is Steam?

00:48:06.700 --> 00:48:07.540
 - Steam is just-

00:48:07.540 --> 00:48:09.500
 - Oh, that's so embarrassing.

00:48:09.500 --> 00:48:12.220
 But just for the other people who don't know what it is.

00:48:12.220 --> 00:48:14.140
 - It's for those idiots listening at home.

00:48:14.140 --> 00:48:18.100
 - No, just kidding. Steam is just a game library, essentially.

00:48:18.100 --> 00:48:20.860
 So it's, if you're on a PC, you can download games

00:48:20.860 --> 00:48:23.740
 and almost all games, unless they're like console exclusive

00:48:23.740 --> 00:48:25.820
 will be on Steam that you can download.

00:48:25.820 --> 00:48:26.660
 - And a console?

00:48:26.660 --> 00:48:28.460
 (laughing)

00:48:28.460 --> 00:48:31.060
 - Are you taking you guys out gamers?

00:48:31.060 --> 00:48:32.140
 - I've actually lost Steam.

00:48:32.140 --> 00:48:33.060
 - You have got Steam.

00:48:33.060 --> 00:48:33.900
 - Do you?

00:48:33.900 --> 00:48:34.740
 - What games do you play?

00:48:34.740 --> 00:48:36.140
 - Don't play many games on it.

00:48:36.140 --> 00:48:36.980
 - No, really?

00:48:36.980 --> 00:48:37.820
 - I play Fortnite, all right?

00:48:37.820 --> 00:48:38.740
 I play Fortnite against eight year olds

00:48:38.740 --> 00:48:40.940
 around the world, I'm a lose.

00:48:40.940 --> 00:48:43.740
 - I tried Fortnite and I was just too embarrassed

00:48:43.740 --> 00:48:46.620
 to continue, 'cause the skill cap of that game is so high

00:48:46.620 --> 00:48:48.500
 and these 14 year olds that have been playing

00:48:48.500 --> 00:48:51.420
 since they were nine are just so good

00:48:51.420 --> 00:48:53.900
 that you couldn't possibly just start a game now

00:48:53.900 --> 00:48:56.020
 and be anywhere near as good as them.

00:48:56.020 --> 00:48:58.300
 So it's just, you know?

00:48:58.300 --> 00:49:01.020
 - If I put myself in the mind of a 14 year old

00:49:01.020 --> 00:49:03.380
 playing this game, would it be immediately obvious

00:49:03.380 --> 00:49:04.500
 which one Andy was?

00:49:04.500 --> 00:49:06.140
 - Oh yeah, yeah, I think so.

00:49:06.140 --> 00:49:07.660
 - I'm the guy hiding in one of the buildings,

00:49:07.660 --> 00:49:09.420
 just trying to have a nice afternoon.

00:49:09.420 --> 00:49:12.380
 There's a cookie, I'm trying to click on that.

00:49:12.380 --> 00:49:13.220
 - Yeah.

00:49:13.220 --> 00:49:15.960
 - He's soaring out the bed from a minute.

00:49:15.960 --> 00:49:18.260
 (laughing)

00:49:18.260 --> 00:49:19.820
 - Trying to escape.

00:49:19.820 --> 00:49:23.140
 - Here's a fact about the guy who invented

00:49:23.140 --> 00:49:25.980
 video games, arguably, and it's sent in by,

00:49:25.980 --> 00:49:28.100
 listen to this, it's sent in by Grant Wyn Jones,

00:49:28.100 --> 00:49:30.140
 who's sent in the fact that nuclear bombs

00:49:30.140 --> 00:49:32.380
 and video games were created by the same guy.

00:49:32.380 --> 00:49:35.380
 - Yeah, that's actually a deleted scene from

00:49:35.380 --> 00:49:36.220
 Oppenheimer. - Oppenheimer.

00:49:36.220 --> 00:49:38.020
 (laughing)

00:49:38.020 --> 00:49:39.300
 - Well, it's not Oppenheimer,

00:49:39.300 --> 00:49:41.420
 but it's a guy called William Higginbotham,

00:49:41.420 --> 00:49:45.940
 great name, who did invent the first screen-based

00:49:45.940 --> 00:49:48.580
 video game, it was called Tennis for Two,

00:49:48.580 --> 00:49:50.260
 and it was in 1958.

00:49:50.260 --> 00:49:51.500
 - Sounds like Pong, right?

00:49:51.500 --> 00:49:55.820
 - It's pretty Pong-y, it's like 2D tennis.

00:49:55.820 --> 00:49:57.500
 There was nothing to play it on,

00:49:57.500 --> 00:49:59.860
 so you had to play it on an oscilloscope,

00:49:59.860 --> 00:50:01.980
 which is a device to measure voltage waves,

00:50:01.980 --> 00:50:04.260
 and that, because there were no consoles,

00:50:04.260 --> 00:50:06.340
 no screens, no, nothing.

00:50:06.340 --> 00:50:08.580
 And he also worked on the Manhattan Project,

00:50:08.580 --> 00:50:09.780
 and he was in charge of the team

00:50:09.780 --> 00:50:11.300
 which made the electronic triggers

00:50:11.300 --> 00:50:13.420
 for the first nuclear bombs.

00:50:13.420 --> 00:50:16.340
 So, that's the fact, it stacks up.

00:50:16.340 --> 00:50:17.180
 - That's great. - And he played

00:50:17.180 --> 00:50:18.460
 the accordion as well.

00:50:18.460 --> 00:50:20.420
 And his daughter wrote a memoir about him

00:50:20.420 --> 00:50:23.060
 called Accordion to Willy, which is...

00:50:23.060 --> 00:50:26.300
 (laughing)

00:50:26.300 --> 00:50:27.820
 - While we're talking about sort of like

00:50:27.820 --> 00:50:30.420
 the founding figures of video gaming,

00:50:30.420 --> 00:50:32.740
 one person who's known as the father

00:50:32.740 --> 00:50:34.540
 of the video games industry,

00:50:34.540 --> 00:50:36.380
 and I believe this is the person who kind of took it away

00:50:36.380 --> 00:50:37.980
 from PC and said, the television,

00:50:37.980 --> 00:50:39.940
 why are we not getting it on the television,

00:50:39.940 --> 00:50:41.620
 was an engineer and inventor,

00:50:41.620 --> 00:50:45.060
 and his name was Ralph Baer.

00:50:45.060 --> 00:50:47.180
 - Oh, spelled the same as Clara.

00:50:47.180 --> 00:50:50.940
 - Yes, and a translation that they are...

00:50:50.940 --> 00:50:54.020
 No, they're not, I couldn't find any relation.

00:50:54.020 --> 00:50:57.500
 I was so excited when I saw the connection, name, but no.

00:50:57.500 --> 00:50:59.460
 - That's so funny. - Nothing, yeah.

00:50:59.460 --> 00:51:01.820
 - Last game that I played to any regularity

00:51:01.820 --> 00:51:04.500
 was Mario Kart, N64. - Oh yeah.

00:51:04.500 --> 00:51:06.940
 - And there's a really nice economic theory

00:51:06.940 --> 00:51:09.940
 that the world should be like Mario Kart.

00:51:09.940 --> 00:51:11.340
 - Okay, they're all like,

00:51:11.340 --> 00:51:13.100
 I can kind of see what you mean.

00:51:13.100 --> 00:51:13.940
 - Oh really? - Yeah.

00:51:13.940 --> 00:51:16.540
 If you're in the front in a game of Mario Kart,

00:51:16.540 --> 00:51:18.380
 your power-ups are less powerful.

00:51:18.380 --> 00:51:20.220
 So if you're first, you will get like,

00:51:20.220 --> 00:51:23.180
 maybe a banana peel to throw behind you, which, yeah.

00:51:23.180 --> 00:51:25.460
 But then if you're last, you will get a power-up

00:51:25.460 --> 00:51:27.420
 that's like turns you on a torpedo.

00:51:27.420 --> 00:51:29.500
 - A giant bullet guy, yeah. - Yeah, a giant bullet guy

00:51:29.500 --> 00:51:32.580
 that can go to the top, or the blue shell,

00:51:32.580 --> 00:51:35.140
 which automatically wipes out the person in first.

00:51:35.140 --> 00:51:38.300
 So I guess in the sense that it kind of

00:51:38.300 --> 00:51:40.580
 evens things out in society a little more.

00:51:40.580 --> 00:51:42.900
 - Exactly, it's like Reverse Iron Rand, basically.

00:51:42.900 --> 00:51:44.900
 And it's known as rubberbanding.

00:51:44.900 --> 00:51:47.100
 And the idea is that anyone at the back of society

00:51:47.100 --> 00:51:50.220
 gets a huge boost, and it helps everyone in society,

00:51:50.220 --> 00:51:51.660
 especially as those people at the bottom

00:51:51.660 --> 00:51:54.940
 tend to be like farmers or people who are helping

00:51:54.940 --> 00:51:57.180
 at the base of everything.

00:51:57.180 --> 00:51:58.980
 And apparently that would be a great way of doing it,

00:51:58.980 --> 00:52:01.260
 apart from good luck finding anyone to vote for it.

00:52:01.260 --> 00:52:02.900
 (all laughing)

00:52:02.900 --> 00:52:03.740
 - That's really interesting.

00:52:03.740 --> 00:52:06.260
 - That's a lovely idea. - I like that theory, yeah.

00:52:06.260 --> 00:52:10.100
 - In 2004, someone made a device that is a Game Boy,

00:52:10.100 --> 00:52:13.100
 and the Game Boy is also attached to kind of a thing

00:52:13.100 --> 00:52:16.540
 that goes over your mouth, which gives you nitrous oxide

00:52:16.540 --> 00:52:19.420
 and basically makes you pass out.

00:52:19.420 --> 00:52:22.780
 And this was for children. - What was the function of?

00:52:22.780 --> 00:52:24.260
 - To stop them playing?

00:52:24.260 --> 00:52:25.660
 - No, no, not to stop them playing.

00:52:25.660 --> 00:52:26.740
 - But as in you have enough nitrous oxide,

00:52:26.740 --> 00:52:28.140
 you do well enough at the game, you pass out,

00:52:28.140 --> 00:52:29.380
 you stop playing the Game Boy?

00:52:29.380 --> 00:52:30.260
 - No, it's not that.

00:52:30.260 --> 00:52:32.100
 Any other thoughts why you might do this?

00:52:32.100 --> 00:52:33.260
 It's for children.

00:52:33.260 --> 00:52:36.300
 - It's for children. - For children to pass out.

00:52:36.300 --> 00:52:39.020
 - So if they're going into surgery and they need to--

00:52:39.020 --> 00:52:41.140
 - Oh! - Oh my gosh!

00:52:41.140 --> 00:52:42.860
 - Got it in one damn, yeah.

00:52:42.860 --> 00:52:45.580
 So the idea is it's hard to give kids anesthesia

00:52:45.580 --> 00:52:47.700
 and keep them calm while you're doing it.

00:52:47.700 --> 00:52:49.380
 If you give them a Game Boy to play,

00:52:49.380 --> 00:52:52.460
 then they're distracted and they get the anesthesia.

00:52:52.460 --> 00:52:54.740
 And it was designed, but never--

00:52:54.740 --> 00:52:56.260
 - Never used. - Never used.

00:52:56.260 --> 00:52:58.300
 - Well, it's unfair on children who are not good at video,

00:52:58.300 --> 00:52:59.500
 like I'm not very good at video games.

00:52:59.500 --> 00:53:01.380
 So I would still be on lying there.

00:53:01.380 --> 00:53:04.340
 - Now it's later, the surgeon's ready to go home.

00:53:04.340 --> 00:53:06.940
 I might as well--

00:53:06.940 --> 00:53:09.420
 - It's just the tutorial, come on!

00:53:09.420 --> 00:53:11.660
 (laughing)

00:53:11.660 --> 00:53:18.020
