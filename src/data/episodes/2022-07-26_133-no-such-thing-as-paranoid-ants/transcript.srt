 [MUSIC]

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
 [APPLAUSE]

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:20,000
 >> Hello and welcome to another episode of no such thing as a fish, a weekly podcast coming to you from Up the Creek in Greenwich, London.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
 Please welcome to the stage. It's Andrew Hunter Murray, and it's Isinski and James Orkin.

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
 [APPLAUSE]

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
 >> And once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days.

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
 And in no particular order, here we go.

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
 Starting with you, James Orkin.

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:49,000
 >> Okay, my fact this week is that this week's presidential debate was best watched with the sound turned off.

11
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
 [LAUGHTER]

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
 >> What do you mean by that?

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
 >> It's just my opinion.

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
 [LAUGHTER]

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:05,000
 >> No, this was a study. This was a study done by the professor of economics at Dartmouth and also the University of Chicago, so it was two people together.

16
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:17,000
 And they found that if people are watching a debate, you can tell who's more likely to win the election by seeing how charismatic and how kind of relaxed and how confident they are.

17
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,000
 But the problem happens when you turn the sound on and you're distracted by their policies.

18
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
 You can't tell anymore.

19
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
 [LAUGHTER]

20
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
 >> I can tell you for a fact there was no chance of being distracted by the policies being discussed last night, so I think you're okay.

21
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
 >> That's true.

22
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:41,000
 So obviously I'm talking from a British perspective, so I can't vote in this election, so it doesn't make much difference to me who I think I should vote for.

23
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
 But it does make a difference to me who I think will win or who I think will lose.

24
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:54,000
 And so if I watched 10 seconds of each of candidates on silent, I should be able to tell who's going to win the election.

25
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
 And I did this, and it's bad news guys.

26
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
 [LAUGHTER]

27
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
 >> What? Hillary gets in?

28
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
 [LAUGHTER]

29
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:18,000
 >> Yeah, I mean, what can I say of how from the fact that I watched the first 10 seconds of each person's speech and Hillary was kind of blinking a lot and looking away and Trump just looked more confident?

30
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
 >> Yeah, he's a very confident man. I don't think anyone's ever to notice that.

31
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
 [LAUGHTER]

32
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
 >> Even the revelation from you, though, James.

33
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
 >> Even though what, didn't you want a secret service code name to be humble at one point?

34
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
 >> That's true.

35
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
 >> I think you didn't ask for that.

36
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
 >> That's right.

37
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
 >> So a confident man with a sense of irony.

38
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
 >> Did you guys see that the Kansas State Police, they have a Twitter account?

39
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
 Did you see that tweet that they sent out?

40
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
 >> No.

41
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:46,000
 >> So they sent this tweet out just before the debate started, which said, reminder in capital letters,

42
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:54,000
 we realize politics can make emotions run high, but being mad at a presidential candidate in a debate is not a reason to call 911.

43
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
 [LAUGHTER]

44
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
 >> And I think they've been inundated with calls, yeah.

45
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:07,000
 >> I saw some people warning not to play. There was this idea of a drinking game where every time Trump tells a lie, you take a shot.

46
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
 [LAUGHTER]

47
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,000
 >> Sirosis figures have mysteriously rocketed across America.

48
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:18,000
 So there's been a lot about fact-checking about whether journalism has the duty to fact-check

49
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
 and whether because there are so many fibs being thrown around in this election.

50
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
 And I love the rating systems they have.

51
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:34,000
 So politic fact is a website, and the rating system goes to true, mostly true, and then the three bottom categories are mostly false, false, and pants on fire.

52
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
 [LAUGHTER]

53
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:44,000
 >> And I measured 260 give or take statements from each candidate.

54
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
 Trump's seven out of ten were in those last three categories.

55
00:03:47,000 --> 00:04:05,000
 The Hillary was 27, but still, and the Washington Post gives, they have fact-checked 75 Trump statements, and of those 75, 49 received a four Pinocchio rating, which is totally false.

56
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:16,000
 And this is the interesting thing. It's average Pinocchio rating is 3.4, and in 2012, in that election, the highest rated was Michelle Bachmann, who got 3.08.

57
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:21,000
 And I think she believes in witchcraft, so that can be an inclination.

58
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:28,000
 >> Mind you, that's not a lie if she believes it. I think you can only lie if you're, if she says witch is a real, I don't think she's lying if she genuinely thinks they're real.

59
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:43,000
 >> That's true, actually, and I read there was a kind of a Republican commentator who said, "Actually, Trump isn't lying, because he just hasn't checked it, and he's just saying it, and technically that isn't lying, that's bullshit."

60
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
 [LAUGHTER]

61
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
 >> My ears are burning!

62
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
 [LAUGHTER]

63
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
 >> You are off the Pinocchio scale.

64
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
 [LAUGHTER]

65
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:02,000
 >> People are reporting now in America, Trump-induced anxiety. As in, this is a column that Michelle Goldberg, a slate columnist, did.

66
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:09,000
 And she investigated, spoke to a bunch of therapists, of psychologists, of psychoanalysis, and they're all reporting cases of Trump-induced anxiety.

67
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:17,000
 So one of them in New York said, "Six out of seven daily appointments will be someone discussing how they're made to feel anxious and uncomfortable because of the election."

68
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:27,000
 There was a victim who described a nightmare as insomnia, digested problems, and turned out she realized it was triggered by when she turned on the news, and realized what was happening.

69
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:32,000
 So she's now determined to cut down on her news consumption, as a way of curing it.

70
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000
 >> Well, this is interesting, because Trump is experiencing the opposite.

71
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:46,000
 We actually got sent in a fact by someone in the crowd here, Tom Boyerson, and he sent in the fact that Donald Trump's doctor has done an analysis on how he is anxious,

72
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:54,000
 and how he's doing. >> Yeah, so the idea is that everyone thought that Hillary was particularly sick, because she coughed that time, and she took some time off for a pneumonia.

73
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
 And so Trump decided to release his medical records.

74
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:09,000
 >> Yeah, so these are a couple of quotes from his medical record. His blood pressure is astonishingly excellent.

75
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:19,000
 >> What's this doctor's name, Mr. Donald Rump? >> Yeah, it's that same thing, his physical stamina and strength are extraordinary.

76
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:27,000
 >> So on debate preparation and things like that, so do you know when the first one was televised?

77
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,000
 >> No, no. >> So it was Nixon against Kennedy, which was 1960.

78
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,000
 >> Was that the same as sweaty one? >> That was the last series.

79
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:43,000
 >> No, so this was the thing, so there's always a load of horse trading about what you get in.

80
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:50,000
 And there's actually a commission on presidential debates who have a senior Republican and a senior Democrat to try and make sure it's completely level.

81
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:59,000
 And Nixon wanted no reaction shots, he said none at all. And Kennedy said, no, I do want shots of reactions and see what the other person's doing while someone's speaking.

82
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:05,000
 But there was a concession which was that nobody, neither of them, was to be shown wiping sweat from his face.

83
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
 >> Because Nixon was famously sweaty.

84
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:13,000
 >> Yeah. >> I've sounds like Kennedy was at home going, oh, I've got such cool reaction shot face.

85
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
 >> What?

86
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:23,000
 >> Do you know how Clinton got around that? >> Hillary or Bill?

87
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
 >> Bill, sorry, yes, got we have to specify.

88
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:34,000
 I think it was Clinton who got around this because it used to be that you weren't allowed to show the other person in the debate while someone was talking.

89
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:41,000
 So when he practices debates, his advice is going to practice on a grid layout of the stage so he could plan exactly where he was going to stand.

90
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:51,000
 And they worked out what the camera angles were going to be. And in his debates against Bush senior, they made sure where he stood, usually the camera angles would have to catch a shot of Bush senior as well.

91
00:07:51,000 --> 00:08:00,000
 So that you could get the reaction shots. And in fact, one of the downfalls of Bush senior in that him versus Clinton campaign was when during one debate he checked his watch while Clinton was speaking.

92
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,000
 And that went down really badly because people don't care about policy.

93
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:09,000
 And so they were like, oh, he's bored, don't have him.

94
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:15,000
 >> So Hillary has been preparing for these debates whereas Donald Trump hasn't at all.

95
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:21,000
 He's been flying around on his jet meeting people. >> He's too busy with his astonishingly excellent blood pressure.

96
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:31,000
 >> Whereas Hillary has been practicing and she's been practicing with lots of different Donald Trumps for all of his different personalities.

97
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:39,000
 So she gets people they might be the angry Donald. >> The sexy Donald?

98
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:45,000
 >> But her name? >> Because he's got no problems in that department. Let me assure you.

99
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,000
 >> Is there like a list that she can grade them on to see which one is the best?

100
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
 >> What I'm asking is, is there a top Trumps kind of?

101
00:08:52,000 --> 00:09:05,000
 >> So her main Trump was a guy called Philip Reigns. And he's one of her most trusted advisors.

102
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:10,000
 He's a bit like a Malcolm Tucker kind of person. He just swears at everyone and shouts at everyone.

103
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:18,000
 And so in that way they thought he'd be a bit like Trump. He doesn't mind picking on her faults and all that kind of stuff.

104
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:24,000
 And I kind of tried to find some facts about him. There wasn't really much, apart from that he has two cats.

105
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:29,000
 And they're called Uday Hussein and Kusay Hussein.

106
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:33,000
 So he's got two cats that are named after Saddam Hussein's sons.

107
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
 >> What? >> Yeah. I know. It's good though.

108
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:42,000
 >> It's such a strange fact. Do we know why? He gave him so names as well.

109
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:56,000
 >> Well, in Saddam Hussein news this week, there's going to be a golden statue of Saddam Hussein sent into orbit.

110
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:03,000
 And this is by an Iraqi American artist who's doing it as kind of a way of expressing himself, I guess.

111
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
 >> Did he do this? That's what artists do, right?

112
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
 >> Is it going to be tiny though?

113
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,000
 >> Yeah, it's going to be pretty small. There used to be a kind of...

114
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
 >> There's no hang on, somewhere in the crowd.

115
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
 >> Somewhere in the crowd expressed audible disappointment.

116
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:21,000
 >> Like a larger statue of Saddam Hussein in space.

117
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
 >> You were hoping it was going to be like the size of the ISS.

118
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:33,000
 So you know it's going to go over and you go, you see that? That's actually not a star.

119
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
 >> The guy's on the ISS.

120
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:41,000
 >> Is that Saddam Hussein?

121
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:50,000
 >> It'd be great if he was like, that can I, so he was waving.

122
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:57,000
 >> In other presidential preparation, so George W. Bush, he used to prepare with Rob Portman,

123
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:05,000
 who played Al Gore in the 2000s, so Portman used to argue with Bush and shout at him and did what he thought Gore would do,

124
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:11,000
 which is go up really, really close to George W. Bush and stay him directing the eye and be really intimidating towards him.

125
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:17,000
 And apparently, when he did this during one of the enactments of the debates, George Bush just put his arms around Portman and kissed him on the head.

126
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:22,000
 >> Which feels like he'd missed the point of the presidential debate in actions.

127
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:27,000
 >> I have a fact about Al Gore and in Al Gore news.

128
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:32,000
 >> In 2012, Mitt Romney was running against Barack Obama to try and prevent it from winning office again.

129
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,000
 And he was really dedicated, so he started practicing a month early,

130
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:44,000
 and he built accurate practice podiums to match the debate stage once, and he had 16 mock debates, so he was super prepared.

131
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:51,000
 And right, this is the thing I've read. I can't quite believe it's true. It's supposedly, he arrived in Denver several days earlier,

132
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:56,000
 so that he could prepare for the altitude of the debate.

133
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:01,000
 >> It is high, but it's not the Himalayas.

134
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
 >> So Obama had a really bad night on the first debate.

135
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
 He wasn't going to at all, everyone said that-

136
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
 >> Not in the Foxigen.

137
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
 >> Al Gore half-dokingly said it was the altitude.

138
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
 >> Yeah, so there we go.

139
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,000
 >> They've made lots of elaborate, like previous presidents have made lots of elaborate mock stages,

140
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:25,000
 so Ron and Reagan converted Elizabeth Taylor's garage into a complete TV studio in which he practiced his debates.

141
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
 >> I mean, that doesn't sound true, does it?

142
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,000
 >> He was an actor, wasn't he? He was a B movie actor.

143
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
 >> Al Gore, was he?

144
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
 >> Sorry.

145
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:42,000
 >> The news were so current, I didn't know which one we were.

146
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
 >> We need to move on to our next phase.

147
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
 >> Oh, wow.

148
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
 >> Yes, yeah.

149
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
 >> Abraham Lincoln.

150
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:54,000
 >> Just the structure you might want to know, the first ever kind of big political debates in America.

151
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:59,000
 So this was in '18, I think '58, so it wasn't presidential, it was for the Senate,

152
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
 and it was him against Senator Stephen A. Douglas.

153
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:10,000
 And the format was, the first guy got to speak for an hour, the next guy got to rebut for an hour and a half.

154
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:15,000
 And then the first guy would close off with another half an hour, so they have an hour and a half each.

155
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:19,000
 >> And we're talking with this as a podcast format, so if you guys are pro.

156
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:24,000
 >> I read that he was such charismatic speaker that there's this one very famous speech of his,

157
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,000
 which was so good, it was so brilliantly awesome.

158
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:33,000
 >> All the journalists there were so captivated by what he was saying, no one wrote it down.

159
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:37,000
 And it's called the Lost Lincoln speech, no one knows what it is.

160
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
 >> Because they said, literally people were holding their pencils and they were like,

161
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,000
 "And they just listened to it, and to this day we have no idea what he said during the speech."

162
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:50,000
 >> That sounds like an assistant flattering Lincoln because he forgot to write the speech down.

163
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,000
 >> Okay, it is time for fact number two, and that is Chazinski.

164
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:59,000
 >> In fact, is that a frog just formatted up a new species of ant.

165
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:03,000
 >> That's this week, right?

166
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:08,000
 >> That's this week, that's just happened, and it's the little devil frog, or Diablito.

167
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:13,000
 And it's this bright orange poisonous frog, and it just threw up this new tropical ant species.

168
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:17,000
 Although when I say threw up, it didn't voluntarily throw up.

169
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:22,000
 This is a thing that scientists do to find new species, they've got so desperate now.

170
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,000
 That's basically sticking their fingers down animals' throats.

171
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
 >> Oh, right.

172
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:33,000
 >> Because they know that these frogs go hunting for bugs in places that are hard to access for them.

173
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
 This isn't Ecuador, this happened.

174
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
 So they hunt these bugs in places that maybe the scientists wouldn't find.

175
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:43,000
 The scientists then insert a tube into their stomach and flush all the contents out of it.

176
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:47,000
 So they pour water down the tube that's gone through the frog's mouth into its stomach.

177
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:53,000
 They flush the contents out gently, the article says, but they don't just like squeeze it.

178
00:14:53,000 --> 00:15:00,000
 It's more of a massage, a like massage, and this ant...

179
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:05,000
 >> It is very musically miming a massage on the floor.

180
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:10,000
 >> A lot of physical comedy in this story, Dan.

181
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,000
 For what is essentially an audio show?

182
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
 >> Did you say they have a tray?

183
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:20,000
 >> They put the vomit into it, yes, and they sort of like they used a pan for gold, in fact.

184
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
 They sort of find the new species in the...

185
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
 >> It's great.

186
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:27,000
 >> And then I read that they let the frog back into the wild.

187
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:33,000
 And you said they're going to be all right, but I want to drink five pints of water in four minutes for a bet.

188
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,000
 And that frog is not going to be good.

189
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:41,000
 He is going to be wandering around busy, not really knowing what's going on for about 15 minutes.

190
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:46,000
 >> But we did find a new species of frog in your vomit.

191
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:51,000
 Weirdly, the ant is not the only new species that they found in that batch of vomit.

192
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:57,000
 There's other insects in there that they just haven't classified yet, but there were a bunch of new unknown species inside here.

193
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:03,000
 >> So what they do, if they get a live thing in the vomit, which does sometimes happen,

194
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:10,000
 they do a thing called a cafeteria test, which is where they offer the insect they found multiple different prey items.

195
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
 And they see what it goes for.

196
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,000
 >> It's not the only species that's been found inside another species, either.

197
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
 That's been named and found inside another species.

198
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,000
 And this one I find really cool, this is the Don's Earth snake.

199
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
 And this was found inside another snake in 1932 in Nicaragua.

200
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
 And no one's ever found one since.

201
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
 >> Inside another snake.

202
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
 >> Inside another snake.

203
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
 So it was found inside a coral snake.

204
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
 >> Like a Russian doll of a...

205
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
 >> Yeah.

206
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
 >> My favourite...

207
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,000
 >> A bit of frog news from the last year.

208
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,000
 Is that they were trying to work out.

209
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
 There's a frog called the Bombay Night Frog.

210
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
 And they were trying to work out how it made it.

211
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,000
 Because they'd never been observed because it does it at night.

212
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
 So they went and they managed to track one down.

213
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,000
 And they got their sort of night vision stuff and they followed it.

214
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
 And they saw it mating.

215
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:58,000
 And it was an amazing discovery because there were six sex positions in the frog world.

216
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
 No more than six.

217
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
 So...

218
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
 >> Froggy style?

219
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
 >> Yeah.

220
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,000
 [Laughter]

221
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,000
 But so when they observed this frog was doing it in a seventh position,

222
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,000
 a never before seen position in frog.

223
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
 So they've had to add a new position to frog sex.

224
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:21,000
 But it's so far exclusive to the Bombay Night Frog.

225
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:26,000
 And what it does, and it's crazy, it climbs onto the head of the other frog.

226
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,000
 And it just starts doing the heads.

227
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:35,000
 Again, for people listening at home, that is very amusingly showing someone doing the head.

228
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:41,000
 [Laughter]

229
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,000
 >> So the frog is kind of rotting on the other frog's head.

230
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
 >> It's just there, yeah.

231
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,000
 And then what it does is it lets loose and then...

232
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
 [Laughter]

233
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,000
 And then it dribbles all the way down.

234
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
 >> Yeah.

235
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,000
 >> Just on frog vomit, this is a cool thing.

236
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,000
 So scientists are currently trying to clone a particular frog.

237
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,000
 And it's got extinct, right?

238
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:07,000
 So this is two kinds of frog that went extinct in the mid-80s.

239
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:12,000
 And they were the only known frog species which incubated their offspring in the mother's stomach.

240
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,000
 So once the eggs were fertilized, she ate them.

241
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:20,000
 And they have this chemical in them which says stop producing hydrochloric acid immediately.

242
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
 [Laughter]

243
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
 Because otherwise they'll just be dissolved in the stomach.

244
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:27,000
 And so it turns off the production of hydrochloric acid.

245
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:31,000
 And when the eggs hatch, the tadpoles have to keep producing this stuff in their mucus to say,

246
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
 don't digest us.

247
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
 And then they get bigger and bigger.

248
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,000
 And eventually the mother is entirely stomach on the inside.

249
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,000
 And eventually the pressure builds up and she vomits out the offspring.

250
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
 >> Oh, she vomits out of babies.

251
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
 >> She vomits out of babies.

252
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
 >> Yeah, yeah, yeah.

253
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:50,000
 >> Hey, here's one terrifying frog actually which there's been news about recently is the scrotum frog.

254
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
 >> Oh.

255
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
 >> Which you might have talked about before is the titty car car water frog.

256
00:18:53,000 --> 00:19:00,000
 And this year it's transpired that they're critically endangered because they are being eaten in Peru

257
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,000
 or drunk as part of a smoothie which is supposed to be an afridiz yak.

258
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
 But they are.

259
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
 So they came second to the blobfish.

260
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:11,000
 Do you remember a few years ago there was that contest for the world's ugliest animal, blobfish one.

261
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
 They were second.

262
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,000
 >> That's even worse isn't it really than being the ugliest?

263
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
 >> Being the second ugliest.

264
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
 >> It isn't also.

265
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
 I think that's so sweet.

266
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
 >> Well they look exactly like scrotums.

267
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:25,000
 >> They are more attractive than scrotums I would say.

268
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,000
 [Laughter]

269
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
 >> It's more attractive than a scrotum.

270
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
 >> I know it is.

271
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
 [Laughter]

272
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
 >> It's almost impossible to believe.

273
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
 [Laughter]

274
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,000
 >> I've actually got a picture if you want a picture of what?

275
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
 >> A picture of what?

276
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
 [Laughter]

277
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,000
 >> Look, so I think it's unbelievably sweet.

278
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:50,000
 It's got this flabby, flabby skin but that's because it lives in areas without much oxygen

279
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:54,000
 like a quatic environment so high altitude so it needs lots of surface area to absorb it.

280
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:59,000
 I think it's adorable, the person who's studying them says they have permanent smiles and dark

281
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,000
 forward-facing eyes that give them a sweet cartoonish look.

282
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
 >> But I don't know about scrotums.

283
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,000
 [Laughter]

284
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
 >> We need to move on in a sec.

285
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
 >> All of my research was about ants.

286
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
 [Laughter]

287
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:17,000
 One thing about ants, this was in new scientists two weeks ago.

288
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:23,000
 There are ants trapped in a nuclear bunker and they've developing their own society.

289
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
 [Laughter]

290
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
 >> What do you mean?

291
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:32,000
 >> So there's this nuclear bunker underneath a forest somewhere and there's a ventilation pipe

292
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:38,000
 and the ants just keep walking past this ventilation pipe and falling in and they can't get out again.

293
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,000
 So they've kind of built their own nest and they're living as like a little society.

294
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,000
 >> But it's not I thought you meant they were just very paranoid ants.

295
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
 [Laughter]

296
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:53,000
 >> So unfortunately as far as they can see there's no food and so they kind of set up a nest

297
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:58,000
 and these ants keep falling down into this society but then they all die because there's no food.

298
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:04,000
 And there's a carpet of ants that's two centimetres deep over this whole new nuclear bunker.

299
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,000
 >> So that's what we've got to look forward to when the nuclear apocalypse comes.

300
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
 >> Yeah, a carpet event is elected.

301
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
 >> That's all we've got to look forward to.

302
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
 [Laughter]

303
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,000
 >> Okay, it is time for fact number three and that is Andrew Hunter Murray.

304
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:22,000
 >> My fact is that a group of Saxon soldiers is marching 300 miles towards Hastings.

305
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,000
 And this is happening now.

306
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
 It's topical.

307
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:33,000
 It's a reenactment that they don't because what we've just had is the 950th anniversary of the Battle of Stanford Bridge

308
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:37,000
 and that was the battle three weeks before the Battle of Hastings.

309
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,000
 So we're about to have the 950th anniversary of that.

310
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,000
 And English heritage have kind of been involved in this.

311
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,000
 They've set up a group of soldiers and they're marching.

312
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:51,000
 They started in York on day one and they are marching all the way down the country.

313
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,000
 They're going to stop in Hyde Park in London for a bit.

314
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
 >> When you say soldiers.

315
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
 >> So reenactors.

316
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
 >> Right.

317
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
 >> That's a big difference.

318
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
 >> All dressed as soldiers.

319
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,000
 [Laughter]

320
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
 >> This is unkind.

321
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
 [Laughter]

322
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
 >> It's unkind.

323
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,000
 >> I spoke to one of them this afternoon.

324
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,000
 >> That's an embarrassing moment when you reenacted it.

325
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
 >> [Laughter]

326
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
 >> Time trouble.

327
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
 >> Not quite from the present.

328
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,000
 I've still got that Nokia ringtone from 10 years ago.

329
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,000
 [Laughter]

330
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:32,000
 >> So I spoke to a very nice man this afternoon called Phil Harper.

331
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,000
 He's from English heritage and he's not one of the ones doing the full stint.

332
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
 He just sort of helped a bit with the setup.

333
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:42,000
 But they're going all the way down the half horse riding and the half walking

334
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:47,000
 and they're sleeping in churches and villagers along the way and you know tying up their horses at night and things.

335
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:52,000
 They've had to improvise a bit with the route because they think that the route they would have gone

336
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:56,000
 when the real Saxon army was going from Stanford bridge down to Hastings

337
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
 was directly on the A1.

338
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:02,000
 [Laughter]

339
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
 So they've compromised that.

340
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:09,000
 But there are bits which they know they would have gone through so there's an old Roman arch

341
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,000
 and Lincoln that these guys would have gone through so they're going to go through that

342
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,000
 and they're going to go on various Roman tracks and things like that.

343
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
 >> It's kind of cool.

344
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:21,000
 >> Do you know who the chairman of the Battle of Stanford Bridge Society is?

345
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
 >> No.

346
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
 >> It's Chris Rock.

347
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
 [Laughter]

348
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
 >> I didn't, I assume it's the same one.

349
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:30,000
 [Laughter]

350
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:35,000
 >> No, so he said this week, Chris Rock said this week that the reason they're doing it

351
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:39,000
 and he's led this is because the battles in Yorkshire are overshadowed by the whole battle of Hastings thing

352
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
 which is actually very true.

353
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:47,000
 So we don't I think give King Harold enough sympathy for the fact that he'd been under attack

354
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:51,000
 from the Scanner from the Vikings for a long time England had, Britain had.

355
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:58,000
 And he finally got up to Stanford Bridge and defeated the Vikings, defeated Harold number two,

356
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,000
 and his brother at the same time didn't he?

357
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:06,000
 So as in King Harold of England's own brother was fighting him, he defeated him, he defeated Harold

358
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:10,000
 Hardrada, he went, thank fuck for that, we've actually got our own country for once.

359
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:16,000
 Three weeks later he went down south and got defeated by the Normans who essentially still in charge I think.

360
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
 [Laughter]

361
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,000
 But yeah, so three weeks of independence England had?

362
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
 [Laughter]

363
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:32,000
 Initially I read a letter to the Hastings observer from this week and it was from a man called Ethel Red Ronaldson.

364
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
 [Laughter]

365
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:42,000
 And he said I have just visited the seafood and wine festival in Hastings and I must say it was an excellent event.

366
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:48,000
 I was however dismayed to see that the flag on the logo representing King Harold was a St. George flag.

367
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:54,000
 This St. George flag was brought in in the 13th century to replace the Saxon white dragon.

368
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:59,000
 It is therefore a symbol of Norman oppression of the Saxon people.

369
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:07,000
 The Normans stole our land and were nasty and unpleasant to the English people and they're still in charge.

370
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:11,000
 So I think he needs to get over it a little bit.

371
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
 [Laughter]

372
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:26,000
 But they are still in charge, Normans. This is the interesting thing is that there's Norman names today still belong to people who tend to have more prosperous careers and tend to be wealthier.

373
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
 Like Norman.

374
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,000
 [Laughter]

375
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:32,000
 So another thing they did is brought us surnames, thank you the French.

376
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:37,000
 So before the Normans came everyone had weird ass names like Ethel Red and Edric and Lotric or whatever.

377
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:41,000
 And then the French came over and we loved them so much, we adopted all their names.

378
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:46,000
 We only really had two names so we all became called either William or John.

379
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:50,000
 And then there was all this confusion in England because everyone was called either William or John.

380
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:56,000
 And I think by 1379 half the men in England were called William or John.

381
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,000
 [Laughter]

382
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:01,000
 So that's why we needed surnames because we all had the same first names.

383
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:04,000
 Because we couldn't think of just get more first ones.

384
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:13,000
 And they used to have amazing names, so right, King Harold Goughmanson, who the King Harold who was killed at the Battle of Hastings, his mistress was called Edith Swanneck.

385
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:17,000
 No, he had a shame that that name has fallen into obedience.

386
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
 [Laughter]

387
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
 I think it's a really nice name.

388
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:27,000
 English Heritage have just done a survey of how many people recognise the key participants in the Battle of Hastings and Stanford Bridge and so on.

389
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:32,000
 And more people recognise the names Stanis Brathion and Daenerys Targaryen.

390
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
 [Laughter]

391
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:39,000
 Then they recognised Harold Hadrada or Edgar the Atholing, who was pronounced...

392
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:42,000
 So which one was Daenerys? Was she Stanford Bridge or was she...

393
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
 [Laughter]

394
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,000
 But most of them recognise Duke William of Normandy and Harold Goughmanson.

395
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
 So actually it's not a terrible result.

396
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
 I mean Edgar the Atholing was a minor figure.

397
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:55,000
 He was the one who was pronounced King after the Battle and then he was King for about a week.

398
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
 Right.

399
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
 I think that is asking a lot of people.

400
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:02,000
 I agree. I agree.

401
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,000
 I reckon that was James' newspaper writing guy writing it again.

402
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:09,000
 Typical Norman impression of the scene every day at the moment.

403
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
 Forgotten.

404
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,000
 Forgotten.

405
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
 I'm justly forgotten.

406
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:16,000
 Every school in the county should have an Edgar the Atholing room.

407
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,000
 [Laughter]

408
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:24,000
 The historical reenactments of this battle have been going on obviously for ages.

409
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:28,000
 And there was a guy, I just want to tell you about, in 2006, there was a man playing King Harold,

410
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
 who was Roger Barry.

411
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:32,000
 He was a sergeant in the military provost guard service.

412
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,000
 And I just wanted to read out this quote from him.

413
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:39,000
 He said he was fairly confident that the onlookers will know who he was.

414
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:43,000
 He said, "When the archers raise their bows, I will produce a dummy arrow,

415
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:47,000
 which I will place to my eye and collapse heroically.

416
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:50,000
 Then I will retire to the beer tent."

417
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,000
 [Laughter]

418
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
 You're a legend, Roger Barry.

419
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:58,000
 I've just been provided by my fiancé when she was younger.

420
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:02,000
 She worked at this festival, which was called the Warren Peace Festival.

421
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:06,000
 It was out in Kent, and she was serving beer, so she was in the beer tent.

422
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:11,000
 So everyone came, but everyone was kind of really into the idea of the Warren Peace theme to it.

423
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
 And they were going to reenact a battle.

424
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:16,000
 So they started, and she was in the beer tent on her own.

425
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:20,000
 They started the reenactment, and guns were going off, and all this fighting was happening.

426
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:24,000
 And no one had told her that there was going to be a reenactment.

427
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
 So she flipped out.

428
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,000
 She'd gone to the ground.

429
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,000
 She crawled to the St. John's ambulance.

430
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,000
 And she got there, and they're all killing each other.

431
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:36,000
 [Laughter]

432
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:40,000
 I love the idea of the St. John's ambulance being on the under a wall.

433
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:44,000
 [Laughter]

434
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,000
 Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show, and that is my fact.

435
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:52,000
 My fact this week is that scientists have concluded that objects look smaller

436
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,000
 when viewed from between the legs.

437
00:28:55,000 --> 00:29:01,000
 [Laughter]

438
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:05,000
 I was going to say, if you're viewing an object between your legs then...

439
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:08,000
 [Laughter]

440
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:11,000
 As it looks smaller, then...

441
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:14,000
 No, those scientists say it.

442
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,000
 Go on, explain.

443
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:22,000
 Okay, so this was actually published a while ago, but hopefully all of you saw this week

444
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,000
 was the annual ignoble prizes.

445
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:31,000
 Ignoble prizes, if you don't know it, is a scientific award for people who do research

446
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:34,000
 that first makes you laugh, and then makes you think.

447
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:37,000
 And so all the little bits of research that might get ignored,

448
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:41,000
 because it has a slightly odd element to it, or it doesn't have huge impacts

449
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
 to our understanding of the universe.

450
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:47,000
 This is the award system that allows for them to be recognized.

451
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
 And so this was one of the awards that was given.

452
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:52,000
 It was given to a Japanese team who had discovered this.

453
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
 I mean, it's pretty much what it says on the tin.

454
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,000
 It's smaller when you look through your legs.

455
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
 Yeah, but what do you mean by "through your legs"?

456
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:00,000
 Oh, not like X-ray, like you got to look through the hole.

457
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
 You stand up, and you bend over.

458
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,000
 Yeah.

459
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:06,000
 It's like the eight frog sex position, isn't it?

460
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,000
 Yes.

461
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:11,000
 But you look backwards through your legs, and you can kind of see things behind you,

462
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
 and they're supposed to look a bit smaller, is that right?

463
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,000
 Yes.

464
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:18,000
 And they've looked, so in the study, then they investigated whether or not

465
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:23,000
 it was because the image had been inverted, or because you were physically bending over.

466
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:26,000
 And they found out that if you were just inverting glasses,

467
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
 so you can get those glasses which turn everything upside down,

468
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,000
 and then you look to an object, it didn't have the same effect.

469
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:34,000
 So it's not the effect of the image turning upside down.

470
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:39,000
 It's the physical effect, somehow, of you just flipping your body upside down,

471
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
 that causes you to see objects are smaller.

472
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,000
 Amazing.

473
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,000
 And we don't know why.

474
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:48,000
 There is a famous, I think, nice for American tribes that would tell the height of a tree

475
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:53,000
 by walking away from it, and then bending over until they can just see

476
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:58,000
 that the top of the tree is level with the top of the, like, the growing region,

477
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:02,000
 and then you would know the distance that you are from the tree,

478
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,000
 and through trigonometry, you'd be able to work out the height of the tree.

479
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,000
 Wow.

480
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
 And that was the way that they did.

481
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:11,000
 So what did women do for the same thing, I guess?

482
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:16,000
 They would have to subtract the height of the scroll to the front.

483
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
 I mean, we still have legs.

484
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
 That's so interesting.

485
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:27,000
 I love when I hear stories of testicles being used for scientific purposes

486
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:32,000
 if you were like out in the wild, because so that's the Polynesian travelers,

487
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,000
 if they were on boats, and they were looking for which way they wanted to go,

488
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:39,000
 where the tide was going, what they would do is they would dip their testicles into the water,

489
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:42,000
 because it's the most sensitive bit of man's body.

490
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
 So they'd dip in and be like...

491
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:48,000
 That is true.

492
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
 Well, what they did, they had these things called matangs,

493
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:55,000
 which they were made, they were kind of maps that were made out of sticks and rope,

494
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:58,000
 and they would be in the shape of the waves,

495
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,000
 and waves change if there are islands around.

496
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:05,000
 So you can tell when they're by islands are, depending on which way the waves are going,

497
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:08,000
 and actually waves are quite hard to detect.

498
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,000
 You need to use your most kind of delicate part of your body,

499
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
 and for them it was a scrotum.

500
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:16,000
 I mean, they would sometimes use their elbows as well and stuff, but...

501
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:21,000
 Right, because you went to test how warm the baby's milk is with your elbow.

502
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:27,000
 You test how hot the baby's bath is with your elbow.

503
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:30,000
 Oh god!

504
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:35,000
 You have been sticking your scrotum into that milk for no reason whatsoever.

505
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:42,000
 I've got a lot of babies to apologize to.

506
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:47,000
 Worst uncle ever.

507
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:51,000
 I was googling upside down things,

508
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:55,000
 because I just thought, "Okay, look upside down and what else is upside down."

509
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:58,000
 So we were talking about new species that were discovered.

510
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:02,000
 Last year a new monkey was discovered, and they've nicknamed it Snubby.

511
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:06,000
 It's a sneezing monkey, and its nose is upside down.

512
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:12,000
 And it lives in rainy areas, and so as a result, it's nose just takes in all this water,

513
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,000
 and it sneezes because it has little puddle, so it has to go...

514
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
 sneezing all over the water.

515
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:20,000
 So mostly when people are trying to observe this monkey and it's raining,

516
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:24,000
 their head is literally in their legs because they will drown.

517
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
 Oh yeah, they horny'd in their arms.

518
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:29,000
 I didn't know it was upside down.

519
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,000
 That's amazing.

520
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
 I can't work out if it would be more annoying.

521
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
 You know, when you have a trickle-y nose and it goes into your mouth,

522
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:37,000
 it would be more or less annoying if it trickled into your eyes.

523
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
 But it would be different.

524
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,000
 More, more.

525
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:44,000
 More, probably more.

526
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:50,000
 So this prize, this Japanese team won for the objects of smaller three legs.

527
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,000
 It was also quite a big prize because the ignoble prizes had been going

528
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:56,000
 for something like 25 years, is it James?

529
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,000
 Yeah, at least definitely.

530
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:02,000
 And this is the first time that a single country has managed to make it

531
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
 ten years in a row of winning an award.

532
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
 Oh, that's so Japan are the first people.

533
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:09,000
 So a few examples of previous awards that they got.

534
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:12,000
 They got an award for chemistry, which was someone had invented

535
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:16,000
 an infidelity detection spray that wives can spray onto their husbands underwear

536
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:20,000
 so that when they come home, they can see if they've been unfaithful.

537
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:25,000
 And at least let me take them off first.

538
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
 That was a problem in the first place.

539
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:34,000
 I grabbed off of this.

540
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
 I got to go and get the baby as milk.

541
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:47,000
 There was another testicular ignoble awarded this year.

542
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,000
 What's that?

543
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,000
 What's that?

544
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:52,000
 Because they have different categories depending on which papers they want to win.

545
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,000
 So they don't always have this one.

546
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:59,000
 But this year, the ignoble prize for reproduction went to a contraceptive device

547
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:02,000
 where you have to put your testicles in a polyester sling.

548
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:06,000
 So this sling device, it raises the temperature of your testicles

549
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:11,000
 and apparently that is measured by the rectal testicular temperature difference.

550
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:15,000
 So hang on, what are the attempts of your rectums raised as well?

551
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:18,000
 Did they test with the rectal temperature increased?

552
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:22,000
 I think the testicular temperature increases, which decreases the difference

553
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:25,000
 between the rectal and the testicular temperatures, but I might be wrong.

554
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:28,000
 Unless the rectal temperature increases as well, in which case the difference between them stays the same

555
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
 and your experiments void.

556
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:34,000
 Yeah, but I think there are holes in this experiment.

557
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:38,000
 And that's it for our show.

558
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:46,000
 That is all of our facts.

559
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:49,000
