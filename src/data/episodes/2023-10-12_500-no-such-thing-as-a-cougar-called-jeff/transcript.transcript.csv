00:00:00,00:00:04,"Hi everybody, Andy here. Just a couple of announcements before we start this week's show."
00:00:04,00:00:08,"The first announcement is that as you will see from the episode number here,"
00:00:08,00:00:15,this is the 500th episode of No Such Thing as a Fish. And we just wanted to say we are so thrilled
00:00:15,00:00:21,to have made it to 500. We definitely didn't think we would when we started this in 2014.
00:00:21,00:00:24,And we wanted to say thank you to all of you for listening. We know loads of you have been
00:00:24,00:00:28,listening for many years. Plenty of you have been listening right from the get-go. And whether
00:00:28,00:00:32,"you've listened to 500 episodes or whether you've just started, we wanted to say a huge thank you."
00:00:32,00:00:37,It would not have happened without you and we're thrilled you're here. This show is a very special
00:00:37,00:00:42,"one. It was recorded live at the London Podcast Festival. And as many of you know, we've been"
00:00:42,00:00:47,having lots of guests to cover. Anna on maternity leave. This time we pulled out all the stops.
00:00:47,00:00:52,And our special guest is a name that will be familiar to many of you because it's Anna. Anna
00:00:52,00:00:57,Tadinski is back everybody. She's back. She's better than ever. She insults us all in the first
00:00:57,00:01:02,three minutes of the recording. We really hope you enjoy this show. And Anna will be back full
00:01:02,00:01:06,time in another month or so. The second announcement is about a very exciting new book that's been
00:01:06,00:01:13,published. It's called Everything to Play for the QI Book of Sports. And its authors are none other
00:01:13,00:01:18,than James Arkin and Anna Tadinski of this podcast. That's right. James and Anna have written their
00:01:18,00:01:24,first joint book without me in Dan with. It's a brilliant book. It's a history of basically the
00:01:24,00:01:29,"entire world through the medium of sport. So it's great for people who like sport, but it's also"
00:01:29,00:01:33,great for people who don't think of themselves as sport lovers. I don't think of myself as a sport
00:01:33,00:01:38,"lover, but I'm reading it now and I'm absolutely engrossed. I'm learning fantastic new things on"
00:01:38,00:01:44,"every single page. If you know someone who likes sport or if you like this podcast, you will love"
00:01:44,00:01:49,"this book. It is absolutely full of mad, bizarre, wonderful niche things about the biggest sports"
00:01:49,00:01:53,in the world and the smallest ones and everything else in between. James and Anna have also read
00:01:53,00:01:58,"out the audiobook. So if you'd like to listen to them reading it, that's like a huge bumper"
00:01:58,00:02:03,"bonus episode of Fish. That can be done too. Once again, it's called Everything to Play for,"
00:02:03,00:02:08,the QI Book of Sports. Get it now. Get one for yourself and one for someone else at Christmas.
00:02:08,00:02:10,That's it. Hope you enjoy it on with the show.

00:02:17,00:02:34,"Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to a very special edition of No Such Thing as a Fish, our 500th"
00:02:34,00:02:45,show.
00:02:45,00:02:55,"And then, yes, it turns out you get to run over by a tree."
00:02:55,00:02:57,"Oh my god, I'm just around in a fight."
00:02:57,00:03:09,"Yes, yes, yes."

00:03:30,00:03:40,[Music]
00:03:40,00:03:55,"Good evening, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to King's Place. Please welcome to the stage. No"
00:03:55,00:04:03,such thing as a fish.
00:04:03,00:04:11,"Hey, everyone. Thanks so much for coming, everyone, tonight. How are you doing?"
00:04:11,00:04:21,"Fuck yes. All right. Call the music, please. So we are so excited to be here tonight for our"
00:04:21,00:04:30,"500th episode. We are, thank you so much. We've been having a lot of guests over the last nine"
00:04:30,00:04:35,"months to come on in Place of Anna because she's away of maternity, and so we've had a lot of fun."
00:04:35,00:04:42,"Arguably the show's been better, I would say. It's felt stronger. Yeah. I'm joking, guys."
00:04:42,00:04:46,Do you think I'd ever say that? I've actually heard that. She'd kick my fucking ass.
00:04:47,00:04:52,"So, yeah, anyway, we've been having amazing guests coming on, but we thought for the 500th episode,"
00:04:52,00:04:57,"we need a big gun. We need someone who's going to really deliver the goods. Unfortunately,"
00:04:57,00:05:03,"we've found someone a rookie. So please make a feel welcome, kind of guide her in. Please welcome"
00:05:03,00:05:08,"the stage. Ladies and gentlemen, it is the return of Anna Tyshynski."
00:05:08,00:05:28,[APPLAUSE]
00:05:28,00:05:31,"What a funny ruse, Dan. What a hilarious little gag there."
00:05:33,00:05:41,"We're back. Shit. Can I just say, no intro music for me, huge, ridiculously disproportionate buildup"
00:05:41,00:05:46,"that's like welcoming Neil Armstrong back from the moon style buildup, and then no, no intro music"
00:05:46,00:05:53,"for the super special, most exciting guest you've ever had on. Okay. Just a little director's note."
00:05:53,00:05:56,"Well, let's see how you do in this episode, and we might have you back for more."
00:05:58,00:06:03,Thanks. All right. So we got a wheel ready to go. Shall we do it? 500th episode. All right. Okay.
00:06:03,00:06:05,Let's roll theme tune.
00:06:05,00:06:23,"Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast this"
00:06:23,00:06:33,week coming to you from the London podcast festival. My name is Dan Schreiber. I am sitting
00:06:33,00:06:38,"here with James Harkin, Andrew Hunter Murray, and ladies and gentlemen, it is the return of Anna"
00:06:38,00:06:47,"Tyshynski. And once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts"
00:06:47,00:06:54,"for this very special 500th episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, and in no particular order,"
00:06:54,00:07:01,"here we go. Starting with fact number one, and that is my fact. My fact this week is that in"
00:07:01,00:07:07,"preparation for the 500th anniversary of the creation of Michelangelo's David, the people in"
00:07:07,00:07:12,charge of cleaning him had a huge falling out because they couldn't agree if he should be washed
00:07:13,00:07:21,or dry cleaned. This was a big deal. There was 10 years of preparation for this big
00:07:21,00:07:26,"birthday that was coming up, but the one thing that they couldn't decide on near the end was"
00:07:26,00:07:30,"how do you actually do the cleaning process itself? From the image behind us, it looks like"
00:07:30,00:07:36,"he's been hoovered. Well, so this is after a decision has been made and a vacuum was involved,"
00:07:36,00:07:42,"yes. I see. And also I haven't seen Michelangelo's David. Is he really, really big or is the person"
00:07:42,00:07:48,"doing it a tiny little borrower? He's 17 foot, which I'm told by the internet is the average"
00:07:48,00:07:54,"size of a giraffe. If you want to picture that, because we've all seen a giraffe. Well, no, I"
00:07:54,00:07:58,"have. I've just realized I have. Sorry. That's why I say no. Yeah, they've got one at the zoo. Yeah."
00:07:58,00:08:04,But they don't have one of these at the zoo. No. That's how you can tell the difference in many.
00:08:04,00:08:09,Take a tell if you're in the zoo or in Florence. Yeah. What if you're in Florence?
00:08:09,00:08:13,"So it's, yeah, that's the, that's the one test case, which doesn't work because they've got both."
00:08:13,00:08:21,"Yeah. Has it always been this slick? It's not director's commentary. No, it is amazing."
00:08:21,00:08:25,"In fact, the, so for the people listening at home that we've got a picture here of the lady who's"
00:08:25,00:08:30,"cleaning him, I think her name might be Eleonora Pucci, because she's the lady who currently"
00:08:30,00:08:35,cleans David. And she was interviewed about it this year. And she does it every two months.
00:08:35,00:08:39,And she photographs him very carefully to see where basically where the dust is and whether
00:08:39,00:08:44,"any extra grime has accumulated. And then she, she dusts it and she has the special vacuum cleaner"
00:08:44,00:08:49,"designed for statues, which I had no idea was even a thing. And she, she gets on a scaffold"
00:08:49,00:08:53,and she has this backpack vacuum cleaner and just hoops him. I just thought it was a low
00:08:53,00:08:58,pressure vacuum. Is it designed for statues? It's not just a crap vacuum cleaner. It's a Henry.
00:08:58,00:09:04,"Okay. Henry is high pressure. Is it famously? Yeah. I think my vacuum cleaner, I might have"
00:09:04,00:09:09,"accidentally bought a statue vacuum cleaner. Can't even get rid of a cobweb thread. But yeah,"
00:09:09,00:09:13,"I think there might be some jealousy amongst the other statues. Cause did you read, I think it was"
00:09:13,00:09:18,"the comment from her when she said, we dust the other statues four times a year, but his majesty"
00:09:18,00:09:26,"gets the treatment every two months. After they did the big restoration, I was reading an interview"
00:09:26,00:09:32,"with a member of the team called Antonio Pallucci. And he said, only someone with expert"
00:09:32,00:09:36,knowledge and a thorough and long familiarity with the statue will be able to tell that
00:09:36,00:09:42,certain irregularities are no longer there. Okay. And I'm just thinking that that's what I would
00:09:42,00:09:48,"say if I hadn't done it. Yes. Oh, you can't say it. Well, that's because you're not an expert."
00:09:48,00:09:51,"If you're an expert, you'd be able to see what I've done. Yeah. They got so angry about it,"
00:09:51,00:09:57,"didn't they? There was so much drama. Like someone, someone resigned over which cleaning method"
00:09:57,00:10:00,they were going to use. Can we talk about what is the difference in statue terms? Cause I'm not
00:10:00,00:10:03,even sure what the difference is in clothes terms between washing and dry cleaning. What's the
00:10:03,00:10:08,"difference in statutes? Okay. Well, okay. Um, so what I'm going to tell you has a lot of gaps"
00:10:08,00:10:17,"because I don't understand it, but, um, roughly what I'm about to tell you roughly, it's very"
00:10:17,00:10:22,hard to clean a statue. Okay. That's one of the big problems. You're not even dealing with the
00:10:22,00:10:26,grime that it's accumulated over the past. It's about the previous cleaning methods that have
00:10:26,00:10:31,"messed up the statue. So you're kind of dealing with the problems of the past. So, so David was"
00:10:31,00:10:37,cleaned in the 1800s at some time and then nothing until 2004 or three when they were getting ready
00:10:37,00:10:44,"for the big 500 anniversary. So if you use anything that's wet on it, you're going to be making things"
00:10:44,00:10:48,worse. Whereas the brush is just a light thing. So is that dry cleaning? The dry cleaning is the
00:10:48,00:10:54,"brush. The vacuuming is the, is the dry cleaning. A wet cleaning would be washing machine, soapy"
00:10:54,00:11:00,"water, soapy water, a big car. I'll imagine a car wash with the David Cakes. Yeah. So, but"
00:11:00,00:11:04,you had these two people. You had the director of the museum who was going for one side. You had
00:11:04,00:11:08,the person who was brought in arguing for the other side. And then there was an international
00:11:08,00:11:13,"body of artists who were protesting and writing letters saying, let them just stay dirty. They"
00:11:13,00:11:18,"didn't want them cleaned at all. Yeah. So it's, uh, why do we want them to stay dirty? Is that"
00:11:18,00:11:23,"because I think in case of a case of damage, yeah, because they did in the olden days, didn't"
00:11:23,00:11:26,"they? Like they cleaned in with hydrochloric acid, I think that time in the 19th century,"
00:11:26,00:11:32,"yeah, which really screwed them up. Yeah. Wow. Have you heard of, uh, natural enzyme cleaning?"
00:11:32,00:11:35,"No, what's that? There's a thing that lots of curators do and it's basically spitting on the"
00:11:35,00:11:41,"artworks that you, oh yeah. Yeah. They don't actually spit that. I think, well, the good ones"
00:11:41,00:11:46,"don't spit on the artworks. Basically you use, you, you lick a cotton bud and then you use that."
00:11:46,00:11:50,"But, uh, but during COVID, they stopped this practice, but loads of really senior people"
00:11:50,00:11:54,"but it's so safe. That's the thing. It's so, it's one of those things which was a bit,"
00:11:54,00:11:59,"it was a bit overkill. Yeah. People aren't going licking David, are they? Exactly. Unless visitors"
00:11:59,00:12:03,"are actually licking the thing, then it was, it is totally safe. So if you are in the National"
00:12:03,00:12:09,"Gallery and you spit on a painting, is that defense, do you think? When they come around"
00:12:09,00:12:14,"and say, we said not to go near it, I think you can probably say, I'm just cleaning,"
00:12:14,00:12:20,"my lease or whatever. Who's not in the National Gallery? I know. Yeah. It's worth trying, I think."
00:12:20,00:12:24,"If you do anything. Do you know, so one of the few things that were on David that needed cleaning,"
00:12:24,00:12:32,"there was beeswax on him. Really? Why would there be beeswax? Because, because bees have made a,"
00:12:32,00:12:40,"made a hive inside his butt crack. Good call. No. Yeah. Um, I'd say the same answer was James."
00:12:40,00:12:47,"Yeah. Correct. Yeah. Sometimes I just need to hear it a second time. So beeswax is used to,"
00:12:47,00:12:52,"that's a cleaning product, isn't it? That's, that's why. Yeah, you get beeswax to clean with. Yeah,"
00:12:52,00:12:57,"presumably. So they're not entirely sure, but what they think it is, is that back in the day,"
00:12:57,00:13:01,"pre-electricity, when people were coming to see, and they were on, let's say, a higher ledge to"
00:13:01,00:13:07,"look over it, the candles that they were holding to get a better view was melting on top of David."
00:13:07,00:13:13,"And so they found 15 splashes of beeswax. He was actually bald originally, wasn't he?"
00:13:13,00:13:18,"That's all just wax accumulated. It is weird, isn't it? That, because it's David, David is"
00:13:18,00:13:26,famously a smaller person in the story. Yeah. He's so big. Have you not seen the Goliath statue?
00:13:26,00:13:34,"It's next star. Oh, wow. In the zoo. How many? There's one thing in particular that I have in"
00:13:34,00:13:38,"common with David, the statue. Can you guess what that is? Not the penis."
00:13:38,00:13:47,What do we know about it? You make your wife whoop you every day before you go to work.
00:13:47,00:13:53,We have a lot of suction on our Henry.
00:13:53,00:14:00,It's very much a three-person relationship. I need my wife and Henry.
00:14:02,00:14:03,That's why he's smiling all the time.
00:14:03,00:14:10,What do you have the same as him? Does he have the face blindness thing that you have?
00:14:10,00:14:18,Because he looks like he doesn't recognize anyone. He's mad at us so many times. Look at
00:14:18,00:14:22,"him. He's like, who are you? I know you. I'll be honest, you're not going to get this. We would"
00:14:22,00:14:29,both collapse if we were tilted forward 15 degrees. Is that not the case with all of us?
00:14:29,00:14:33,"No, so a normal human will fall over after about 20 degrees of tilt."
00:14:33,00:14:39,Who got your big head? Is that what it is?
00:14:39,00:14:45,"He's got cracks on his ankles and if you tilt him, his ankles will absolutely collapse."
00:14:45,00:14:52,And I tried this. I videoed myself at home leaning forward until I fell over and then paused it and
00:14:52,00:15:00,"then measured exactly where I stopped. Did you really? Your wife's next door? Darling, Henry and I are waiting."
00:15:00,00:15:06,And it turns out that I can't get much further than 15 either.
00:15:06,00:15:10,"I just want to be clear. I meant you've got a physically big head, not a metaphorically big"
00:15:10,00:15:17,"head. Because that's better, I think. Oh, here's the thing. Michelangelo. Or are you calling Michelangelo"
00:15:17,00:15:24,"or Michelangelo? What do you prefer? Michelangelo. Yeah, I think calling by the name that everyone"
00:15:24,00:15:36,knows him by. Okay. Yeah. Okay. So he was shorter than real life David. I want to say real life David.
00:15:36,00:15:44,"He was just 16 feet. Yeah. No, I'm so sorry. So David in the Bible, the thing is the Bible doesn't"
00:15:44,00:15:48,say the height and weight classes of David and Goliath before they went into the fight. But
00:15:48,00:15:53,"there are lots of sort of biblical scholars who've had a rough, had a go at it. They think"
00:15:53,00:15:58,"he, some think he might be five foot three. And Michelangelo was five two. But we only know that"
00:15:58,00:16:03,because shoes were found in his house. And they basically measured from the shoes. They assessed
00:16:03,00:16:07,"how tall, like if his shoes are this big, then he's this big. So how big was he?"
00:16:07,00:16:12,Five two. He's five foot three. So that's about the same as Lady Gaga or Yuri Gagarin.
00:16:12,00:16:16,Right. And he would be too short to be an Emirates airline flight attendant.
00:16:16,00:16:22,"This is one of those studies, whoever came up with that, that is one of the many reasons I left"
00:16:22,00:16:30,this show originally. Shoes back in the olden days were not measured with that kind of precision.
00:16:30,00:16:33,"A, that meant you could judge someone's height. And then B, you do get to all people with small"
00:16:33,00:16:38,"feet. Yeah, it's, it's, it's an asset. Also, we don't know if they were his shoes. But yeah,"
00:16:40,00:16:44,"they were found in his home. So, you know, yeah. Could have been a servant, could have been his"
00:16:44,00:16:47,"wife. Could have been a servant, could have been his wife. I'm not sure if there was a Mrs. Michelangelo."
00:16:47,00:16:52,I don't know. Right. I think so. I think a lot of people think that he liked men.
00:16:52,00:16:59,"And Michelangelo. Yes. And one of the reasons, fancied men, I mean, and one of the reasons"
00:16:59,00:17:05,is that his female sculptures often seem to be men with breasts. And a lot of people have looked
00:17:05,00:17:10,"into it and you should like look up Michelangelo female drawings and sculptures. They are,"
00:17:10,00:17:15,they're just men. It's like Arnold Schwarzenegger. And then with a sort of pair of lemons jammed
00:17:15,00:17:21,"onto the front. It's so weird. You know, there's a theory as to why his penis is so small. Have"
00:17:21,00:17:32,"you read that? David's. No, James. Look, after all those nights with Henry, as dark as it used to be."
00:17:32,00:17:42,"Oh, dear. Okay. So he famously has a small penis. Yeah. What is it called? No, it's so I thought"
00:17:42,00:17:51,"you said, what is it called? Jeff, it's a private thing. No, so there was a study done and someone"
00:17:51,00:17:56,"who read this study kind of pulled this out as a, as I don't think the authors of the study was"
00:17:56,00:18:02,"specifically saying it, but they read from the detail. It's because he's about to fight a fucking"
00:18:02,00:18:08,"giant and he's terrified. Right. Right. So his penis has shrunk in terror. And that's, that's"
00:18:08,00:18:14,"Michelangelo showing that, um, yeah, like it was an adrenaline thing, isn't it? The body,"
00:18:14,00:18:20,"the body doesn't remove blood from where it's not needed at the moment and puts it in, you know,"
00:18:20,00:18:24,like muscles for fight or flight and things like that. Your body doesn't suck it up so that it
00:18:24,00:18:30,doesn't get hurt in the battle. That would be great. The actual penis on this statue is
00:18:30,00:18:37,"about six inches in length. So, you know, it's not, not small by real terms, but someone on"
00:18:37,00:18:47,"Reddit called bendy, bendy spine. He worked out that in real life, if David was brought down to"
00:18:47,00:18:54,"real size, he would be just under five centimeters. And that means according to standard UK guidelines,"
00:18:54,00:19:02,he would be considered a candidate for penile lengthening surgery. I noticed though he's
00:19:02,00:19:08,"converted it to centimeters to make it sound bigger. Yeah, there are a number of standard"
00:19:08,00:19:14,"maneuvers you can pull. That's sure. But also it's not, it's not, it's not, um, it's not up. No,"
00:19:14,00:19:18,"so it's faster. Yeah. But is that, is that, is that the measurement under which you qualify?"
00:19:18,00:19:24,"Not, I don't need to ask. I'm not asking the fact. So let's just, you know, um, I'll set"
00:19:24,00:19:33,"your legs up for the show. Thank you very much. Cheers. It is time for fact number two, and that"
00:19:33,00:19:41,is Anna. My fact is that having 10 fingers and no thumbs is very useful for playing the piano.
00:19:41,00:19:48,"Okay. Yeah. So if anyone's got that in the audience, then take up the piano. Okay. So how"
00:19:48,00:19:54,"do you end up with? Uh, so this is a condition, a rare condition, sure. But it's where you can be"
00:19:54,00:20:00,"born with, um, no thumbs and instead of thumbs, you have fingers and I just find all this stuff so"
00:20:00,00:20:05,interesting. So it's little tweaks in our genes. So we have genes that specify like the position
00:20:05,00:20:09,of things in our body and they're called hox genes. So that says like your arm goes on your
00:20:09,00:20:14,"shoulder, your foot goes on your leg. It's like funny bones. That book is kind of like that,"
00:20:14,00:20:20,"the hox gene. And if the hox gene gets a mutation in it, then you might end up with something in"
00:20:20,00:20:25,"the wrong place. And so if there's a particular mutation, you might end up with a finger as your"
00:20:25,00:20:33,thumb. And I happen to read two accounts. One is of a woman who had this five finger trait in 1957.
00:20:33,00:20:38,"I actually initially read this in a book called quirks of human anatomy, an evo devo look at the"
00:20:38,00:20:43,"human body, which is so interesting. And I would recommend anyway. Yep. She said she didn't think"
00:20:43,00:20:47,of it as a disability. It didn't hold her back in any way. And actually it meant that she played
00:20:47,00:20:53,the piano more easily. And then there was a Reddit AMA quite recently with a man who has
00:20:53,00:20:58,"the same symptom. And again, he's a professional musician and he said it makes me better at the"
00:20:58,00:21:02,piano. Really? Now I know they don't know how good they would have been at the piano if they'd
00:21:02,00:21:08,"had eight fingers and two thumbs, but wait, hang on. Have you got two joints? You've got, um,"
00:21:08,00:21:13,"I think it varies a little bit, but one of them had one of them was opposable and the other wasn't."
00:21:13,00:21:18,Because some people get this is a trifalangeal thumb. That's what it's called. And it's where
00:21:18,00:21:23,your thumb has three phalanges. Those are the bones inside your fingers instead of two. So it
00:21:23,00:21:27,"might give you a longer thumb, but it might also give you a weaker thumb. And often those are not"
00:21:27,00:21:31,"opposable, which is a pain. That is a pain. So it's useful very much on piano. It lies in on a flat"
00:21:31,00:21:37,"surface, but not on a, you know, another environment like a guitar, which is weird because this guy"
00:21:37,00:21:42,also played the guitar and said it was useful for that. It sounds like he's a really sunny guy.
00:21:42,00:21:49,"Like, yeah, he's making it work. It's amazing. In the, um, report about this woman in 1957,"
00:21:49,00:21:54,"the woman with the five, five fingers on each hand, it said that she came into hospital because she"
00:21:54,00:21:59,was giving birth and that's when they documented her. And then it said her newborn was the same.
00:21:59,00:22:06,So we think the trait is probably genetic. That's a proper scientist. It's not like those
00:22:06,00:22:10,"chances. He found a shoe in Michelangelo's house and said, Oh, well, we think he was five foot"
00:22:10,00:22:19,"two, actually. Do you guys think a thumb is a finger? No. Yeah. For the audience, is the thumb"
00:22:19,00:22:30,"a finger? Yes. Is it not? Pretty evenly match. Well, it's a good job. You guys aren't finger surgeons"
00:22:30,00:22:36,because this is a problem in finger surgery that some surgeons count a thumb as a finger
00:22:36,00:22:42,"and some don't. And if you say to someone, you need to remove the fourth finger on someone's hand."
00:22:42,00:22:47,There have been cases where people have counted from the thumb when they shouldn't have done
00:22:47,00:22:51,and they've taken the wrong finger. Stop it. Really? That has happened. We've invented so
00:22:51,00:22:57,"much stuff as a species. We kind of like the label to go, that's crazy. Well, there are a few papers"
00:22:57,00:23:02,"that have talked about this and most of them say we should call them index finger, ring finger,"
00:23:02,00:23:07,all that kind of stuff and that will remove any problems. But as late as 2009 was the last paper
00:23:07,00:23:12,"that this came in in the Canadian Medical Journal, who said we really need to stop saying fourth finger"
00:23:12,00:23:16,"or third finger or whatever. I mean, for instance, you could be counting from this way or from this"
00:23:16,00:23:22,"way. Yeah. No, who starts with a little finger? That's like people who say a potato. They just don't"
00:23:22,00:23:29,"exist. Or Michelangelo. Yeah, exactly. They should have a like this little piggy system."
00:23:29,00:23:34,"Yeah, like which little piggy the piggy who had roast beef there? We all know which piggy we're"
00:23:34,00:23:38,"talking about. There's not usually toes. Yeah, God, you're a terrible surgeon."
00:23:38,00:23:43,Great news. Got both little piggies. Won't be needing those middle fingers again. What?
00:23:43,00:23:48,"Back in the 19th century, they used to use fingers as a way of determining quite a few"
00:23:48,00:23:52,"medical things. And one of the things was, are you dead? How did they do that? So one of the"
00:23:52,00:24:01,"things was there was a guy who's a French doctor, Leon Collonges. It's like being on the backs of"
00:24:01,00:24:08,"the sand, isn't it? Oh, lovely. I can't say Collonges. It reads like colon juice. I can't."
00:24:08,00:24:16,"Collonges. Join me to read out your facts. Yeah, yeah, please. Leon. Leon Smith."
00:24:19,00:24:23,"His way he believed of confirming if someone was dead, I think they were quite nervous about"
00:24:23,00:24:27,"actually if someone was dead in a coma, if there's if their stats were just lower,"
00:24:27,00:24:31,we didn't have the technology was to take a finger. He would take their finger and he would put it in
00:24:31,00:24:38,"his ear. And he would listen for a buzz, because they sort of thought that the body just emitted"
00:24:38,00:24:42,"a buzz when it was still alive. So he would sit there and he would take their finger, put it in"
00:24:42,00:24:48,"his ear and say, no, he's dead. But wait a minute, fingers don't emit buzzes. So does he just think"
00:24:48,00:24:52,"that everyone's dead when he puts a finger in the ear? I mean, you know, this was a time where"
00:24:52,00:24:57,he was developing a theory and obviously he wasn't. I do know this is about when they didn't know
00:24:57,00:25:02,whether they didn't really know about the pulse and brain activity in the way they do now. And
00:25:02,00:25:07,there were competitions to see which doctors could come up with a guaranteed way of determining
00:25:07,00:25:12,"whether. Yeah, I think we still don't really know when the brain is dead compared to the rest of"
00:25:12,00:25:16,"the body. Yeah, but they did have all and this was one method and they had another was to put an"
00:25:16,00:25:22,"insect in the patient's ear, I think or nose. It must have been like who can resist. Okay."
00:25:22,00:25:27,"If you don't know that, you're dead. And then another finger based one from the 18th century"
00:25:27,00:25:33,"was if someone was in a coma or potentially dead, you would cut their finger off. And yeah,"
00:25:33,00:25:38,"and the idea was you'd cut it off and they'd be like, whoa. And they'd either wake up from death"
00:25:38,00:25:44,or from a coma. So that was another method. Yeah. Do you know just speaking of bodies giving off
00:25:44,00:25:49,"buzzing sounds? I remember reading ages ago, you know, tinnitus. Yeah. Obviously is when you can"
00:25:49,00:25:54,hear a buzzing in your ear. Some people have a form of tinnitus where they emit a buzzing.
00:25:54,00:26:00,"If you get really close as the ENT surgeon, you can be like, yep, you're right. You've got tinnitus."
00:26:00,00:26:06,"That must be really annoying. And isn't that insane? It's crazy. Wow. But I wouldn't hear,"
00:26:06,00:26:09,"like I wouldn't hear your tinnitus and go, God, I've got tinnitus because I was sitting too"
00:26:09,00:26:13,"close to you. No, you'd be able to hear it if you were confused it as my own. No, because I would"
00:26:13,00:26:16,"leave the room and then you go, God, it's so weird. My tinnitus only appears when Anna comes in."
00:26:16,00:26:20,I do usually get a weird headache when you are around.
00:26:20,00:26:28,That's perfectly normal. Can I tell you about Joe Swarbrick? Yeah. Joe Swarbrick was a
00:26:28,00:26:34,"Belfast man who lost a finger in the luckiest way imaginable. Oh, okay. So one that he wouldn't"
00:26:34,00:26:39,"have otherwise needed. I actually don't know that. Oh, okay. No, I like your thinking. A lucky"
00:26:39,00:26:43,finger to have lost. It's more about the circumstances under which he lost the finger.
00:26:43,00:26:48,And he's called Swarbrick. That won't help you. Are you sure? I don't know. I was thinking people
00:26:48,00:26:52,used to be named after things that they'd done and he may have sworn at someone with his middle
00:26:52,00:26:57,finger and then a brick took it out. It's gone. Brilliant. I've missed the theorizing. Nope. That's
00:26:57,00:27:03,"not it. Okay. He was in a job where he only ever had to count to nine. Yeah, that's it. So he was"
00:27:03,00:27:09,"trying to travel to Canada. Okay. Is that a clue? Barely. Like, Oh, barely. Is this something to"
00:27:09,00:27:15,"with bears? No. Oh, okay. And he and his brother wanted, he wanted to go with his brother from"
00:27:15,00:27:23,"Belfast to Canada. Yeah. Okay. And he found a job. Oh, Titanic. Titanic. He found a job on a ship."
00:27:23,00:27:27,"But sadly, at Southampton, there was an accident in the end room, lost his finger,"
00:27:27,00:27:30,"yet they had to kick him off the ship and they said, and take your brother with you too. His"
00:27:30,00:27:36,brother escorted him off the ship and that ship was the Titanic. Wow. Yeah. Why did the brother
00:27:36,00:27:42,"have to go from the version I read unclear? I guess. Wait, you've got a brother, Dan. You're"
00:27:42,00:27:48,working with him on a job. His finger in an awful accident gets chopped off. Yeah. He needs to be
00:27:48,00:27:51,"escorted away from where you work in the job. You'd be like, Well, mate, I still want to do my"
00:27:51,00:27:57,"holiday. So hang on, is it go with him? Wouldn't you? Is it on launch day? It's it's out Southampton"
00:27:57,00:28:01,"at that point. Yeah. So it's just before it was just before it's really just you would have got on,"
00:28:01,00:28:09,"wouldn't you? Oh, it's the Titanic. I'm going to send a postcard. How's the finger? Yeah."
00:28:09,00:28:18,"You won't send a postcard, you know, spoiler alert. Okay. Yeah, that's a good story. And then he"
00:28:18,00:28:23,"was in the Navy in both World Wars and he lived until the fifties. Oh, wow. He was injured in the"
00:28:23,00:28:27,"Second World War as well. He was really, yeah, he was very so he went back to sea and still risked"
00:28:27,00:28:33,his life then. Wow. After that for impressive and the brother. This guy's getting shafted and more
00:28:33,00:28:39,shafted in this story. He's kicked off his job because his idiot brother loses a finger. Next
00:28:39,00:28:44,fingerless guy goes on to World War hero. He's written out a history. He actually I'm sorry.
00:28:44,00:28:48,"Joe Swalbrick himself did get an OBE for his work, not even in the war, just being a great guy in"
00:28:48,00:28:55,"shipping. So yeah, no word on the brother. That's a fucking rough deal, man. You really take"
00:28:55,00:29:00,"in sides of which brother you are. Yeah, that's it. Yeah, you're the brother here. Stay on the"
00:29:00,00:29:06,boat that's going to sink. That's what I say. Wow. Do you guys know what kind of finger a
00:29:06,00:29:13,masculitane is? Say it again. Masculitane. Masculitane. No idea. You're not going to get it.
00:29:13,00:29:18,"Is it like an animal finger or is it a? No, it's not. I'm just going to tell you. It's a finger"
00:29:18,00:29:30,"that's under your armpit. Oh, and can you beckon with it? Yeah, because that is the greatest"
00:29:30,00:29:37,"thing that I have. I have to. This is awful, but I have to explain for people listening to the"
00:29:37,00:29:45,podcast what just happened. Andy is giving me the come to bed finger underneath his armpit.
00:29:47,00:29:50,I haven't been so around since I saw that smile on Henry's face.
00:29:50,00:29:58,"Oh, dear. Oh, gosh. It's not a means of seduction. I don't know why you think exposing your armpit"
00:29:58,00:30:01,"would usually be a means of seduction. Well, normally, if you're getting to exposing your"
00:30:01,00:30:06,"armpit, things are getting pretty hot and heavy, aren't they? Do you go to the beach and go, ""Wow,"
00:30:06,00:30:13,"these people want it?"" Normally in a three-piece tweed suit, you know, I'm heavily dressed down"
00:30:13,00:30:18,"for this. Yeah. You cut the holes, don't you? And then it's armed off if you like someone."
00:30:18,00:30:23,"It's nothing to do with that. Is that another genetic quote? No, this is actually something"
00:30:23,00:30:27,in ancient Greece. And I came across this in a study that was called armpitting among the
00:30:27,00:30:33,"ancient Greeks. And basically, it was where if you'd killed someone, then you would cut their"
00:30:33,00:30:38,finger off and shove it under their armpit. Oh. And we're not quite sure why they did this. We
00:30:38,00:30:44,"think maybe it's either offering it to the gods as like a, ""Sorry, I killed this person. Please"
00:30:44,00:30:50,"forgive me. Have their finger thing,"" which seems a bit kind of on the nose. Or it means that the"
00:30:50,00:30:54,dead person can't take vengeance in the next world because they don't have a finger. But...
00:30:54,00:31:01,"Can you point out the guy who killed you? No. Anyway, this was so common, also known, that there"
00:31:01,00:31:06,"was a specific word, which was masculine, which would literally mean stuff under the armpit,"
00:31:06,00:31:09,which refers to fingers under an armpit. Fingers tucked into an armpit.
00:31:09,00:31:14,"Weird. Or sorry, ""Maskalizmata"" is the stuff under the armpit. ""Maskalitzane"" is to put a"
00:31:14,00:31:19,finger under the armpit again. Do you know what animal has like the longest finger?
00:31:19,00:31:27,"Is it the Madagascar, the eye? The eye, you got it. So if you ever see an image of an eye,"
00:31:27,00:31:32,"they're like a really cute little primate thing, but they've got this really, really long finger"
00:31:32,00:31:37,"that's almost as long as their, probably their whole head, maybe a bit more even. And the interesting"
00:31:37,00:31:44,"thing about that is they love to pick their nose. And when they pick their nose, they go all the way"
00:31:44,00:31:50,in. And no one could work out exactly what was going on because where does your finger go? If
00:31:50,00:31:55,"your finger is, let's say human finger is three times longer at least, and you're putting it all"
00:31:55,00:32:01,"the way up your nose, where is the finger going to end up? A bit in the brain. Or in the eye."
00:32:02,00:32:07,"Exactly. That's what you think, right? So they did a CT scan on an eye who was picking her nose."
00:32:07,00:32:14,And they turned out that actually it kind of goes into the nose through the sinuses and then
00:32:14,00:32:19,down into the back of the throat. And this is... You can get rid of phlegm as well as snot.
00:32:19,00:32:25,"Is that what it's for? It's almost like that, almost as disgusting as that. In fact, perhaps more"
00:32:25,00:32:30,"disgusting than that. Basically, they think that what they're doing is picking their nose"
00:32:30,00:32:36,"and then they're eating it, but they don't have to go through the mouth. Oh, brilliant."
00:32:36,00:32:42,So it doesn't get stuck in their teeth? Secret bogey eating. I'm saving. I would argue not that
00:32:42,00:32:46,secret. And what's secret until those bloody scientists came along with their CT scanner?
00:32:46,00:32:53,"What a great scam, rumbled. We need to evolve that. We will eventually, socially, so that you'll"
00:32:53,00:32:58,never know who's eating their bogeys and who isn't. We will no longer be socially ashamed.
00:32:58,00:33:00,"They will no longer be socially ashamed, those people."
00:33:00,00:33:16,"It is time for fact number three and that is James. Okay, my fact this week is that in the late 1950s,"
00:33:16,00:33:22,a woman called Cougar Annie put an advert in a newspaper looking for a younger man to marry.
00:33:22,00:33:27,But that isn't why she got her nickname. She was just really good at killing Cougars.
00:33:27,00:33:36,There she is on our screen for people at home. She was one of the most badass people that I've
00:33:36,00:33:42,"ever read about. She lived on Vancouver Island. Long story short, we'll get into it all, but"
00:33:42,00:33:49,basically she was married to an opium addict and she lived in Vancouver and to escape the opium dens
00:33:49,00:33:54,of Vancouver. You know those famous opium dens of Vancouver. Her family moved to this really
00:33:54,00:34:00,"remote area of Vancouver Island and she spent her whole time clearing the lands, so getting rid of"
00:34:00,00:34:05,"all the shrubbery, getting rid of all the any kind of wild animals that came to protect herself and"
00:34:05,00:34:12,protect her family. She often had to kill them and according to reports obituaries and stuff like
00:34:12,00:34:19,"that, she definitely shot at least 60 Cougars in her life, mostly in self-defense, but then later"
00:34:19,00:34:24,the government started giving money to people who did it because they wanted to have more humans living
00:34:24,00:34:29,"in that area, so she was making money from it as well. Some contemporary obituaries said that she"
00:34:29,00:34:35,"shot more than 100 Cougars in her lifetime and she also got 80 bears as well. But yeah, she was"
00:34:35,00:34:40,basically going to this area where no humans lived and she was just trying to clear the area so she
00:34:40,00:34:45,could live there. And so her husband dies. She has three kids and she decides I want to look for
00:34:45,00:34:50,"another husband. So in 1936, she advertises... Oh, this is sorry, there are two separate occasions"
00:34:50,00:34:54,"on which she advertised for a younger husband. Yeah, this is the first one, but she used the"
00:34:54,00:35:00,"same advert both times. Exactly. Yeah, 1936, the Western producer, which is where she advertised it,"
00:35:00,00:35:07,"she said, ""BC widow with nursery and orchard wishes partner, widower preferred, object matrimony."""
00:35:07,00:35:14,"And she married someone, right? And she had a few marriages in the end. She lost the husband that"
00:35:14,00:35:21,she had from the 1936 advertising in 1942 when he accidentally shot himself and... Allegedly.
00:35:21,00:35:26,"Allegedly. Yeah. He was dressed as a Cougar at the time though, wasn't he? He was, yeah."
00:35:26,00:35:32,There were suspicions. Yeah. And so then she re-advertises as Andy says with the exact same
00:35:32,00:35:38,"wording. Copy and paste for a new husband. Yeah. So good. Well, when you've worked on the wording,"
00:35:38,00:35:43,it's clearly done the job once. Use it again. Did it work? Hard to say because he wasn't did
00:35:43,00:35:47,"a young man 12 years younger, was it? The last one, yeah. The fourth one. The fourth husband,"
00:35:47,00:35:54,but he was also not very nice. So I think he was a drunk and he stole from her. And then
00:35:54,00:35:57,"eventually, and you probably read more about this, apparently he attempted to run Andy off a cliff"
00:35:57,00:36:01,in order to take over her farm and she chased him away with her shotgun.
00:36:01,00:36:06,She did. That's what happened. And he never came back. And then she lived on in the homestead into
00:36:06,00:36:11,"her 90s and carried on kind of working on there, living off the land, kind of selling bits and"
00:36:11,00:36:18,"pieces. She also set up a post office in the area. There was no one else there. And so basically,"
00:36:18,00:36:23,she would be able to get all these stamps in and then she used the stamps to pay her bills. It was
00:36:23,00:36:29,"like a bit of a scam. But yeah. And by the way, a lot of this time when she was clearing the land"
00:36:29,00:36:35,"and trying to get rid of these wild animals, she was pregnant. So between 1915 and 1931,"
00:36:35,00:36:40,"which was when she did most of the work, she gave birth to at least 11 children. So I'm just saying"
00:36:40,00:36:48,at a nine months off. But maternity leave conditions weren't as beneficial in those days.
00:36:48,00:36:54,"You know, if she'd got full salary for a few months, then how many bears have you killed during the"
00:36:54,00:36:59,"you know, she does sound remarkable. There were a lot of sort of they've paid a lot of"
00:36:59,00:37:02,"bounties, didn't they for killing cougars back in the day? They did. You know, they were trying to"
00:37:02,00:37:08,"sort of, you know, tame the frontiers effectively. And so there were like 200 profession professionals"
00:37:08,00:37:14,in the USA in 1930. And loads more like those were the federal ones and loads of other state ones.
00:37:14,00:37:20,"People like Cougar Smith, or Ben Lilly, who hunted cougars with a knife, which I respect a bit more."
00:37:20,00:37:25,"Okay. As in I think, you know, that's giving the cougar a fighting chance. Yeah, it's not as"
00:37:25,00:37:31,"efficient, is it? It's like if I did this podcast every week, but I decided to find all my facts"
00:37:31,00:37:37,"from the local library only using books between 1812 and 1829. It's like, how interesting that"
00:37:37,00:37:41,you do that. You're not nearly as good at the job. I'm pretty sure you've just described that Andy
00:37:41,00:37:48,"finds fags. Dan, can you not spoiler my fact about the Prince Regent today?"
00:37:48,00:37:56,"On one occasion, Annie heard her dogs barking outside. It was the middle of the night. Obviously,"
00:37:56,00:38:00,she's in the middle of nowhere. So there's no street lights or anything like that. She went
00:38:00,00:38:06,outside. She could hear a commotion. She got her gun to shot into the darkness and then went back
00:38:06,00:38:13,"to bed. And then when she woke up, she saw that she had actually got a cougar with her gun shot."
00:38:13,00:38:19,It's very impressive. Wow. That's amazing. Canada was wall-to-wall cougars at the time.
00:38:19,00:38:24,"It's less impressive than it sounds. You couldn't miss. So she's not the origin of the word cougar,"
00:38:24,00:38:29,"to mean a woman who goes out the younger bed. No, that came well after she died. Yeah, that was"
00:38:29,00:38:34,"sort of 19. They think it might have been 1999, which seems quite early. There was a website called"
00:38:34,00:38:40,"CougarDate.com, which was specifically for women of a certain age, looking for men of a younger"
00:38:40,00:38:44,"age. That was the idea. I mean, it's definitely that. There are some etymologies lost in the"
00:38:44,00:38:49,"midst of time, but we don't know this all. But I think we can say for sure. I must say I actually"
00:38:49,00:38:54,read some articles of the people who set up CougarDate.com and they said that they'd heard the
00:38:54,00:39:00,"name mentioned through their friends earlier, sometime in the 1990s in Vancouver. But it was"
00:39:00,00:39:06,"Vancouver, which is where Cougar Annie was from. Cougars themselves are not cougars."
00:39:06,00:39:14,"So actual cougars, the cats I'm talking about, females reach maturity at two and a half years of"
00:39:14,00:39:21,"age and males at three. So do you see what I mean? Yeah, they don't go for younger males."
00:39:21,00:39:25,Do you know what? I was so glad just because it confirmed something that we've always kind of
00:39:25,00:39:29,thought. You know how cougars have all these different names and you're never sure what
00:39:29,00:39:35,"it is. You're like a puma, a panther, a mountain lion, a catamount. What the hell is going on?"
00:39:35,00:39:39,What are all these cats? And they're all the same thing. And it does have the Guinness
00:39:39,00:39:45,World Record for the most names for a mammal. Yeah. So there you go. And that's 40 according to them.
00:39:45,00:39:52,"Surely the humans have more than 40 names. I'm sorry. No. Cool dude. Awesome. No, I mean actual"
00:39:52,00:39:58,"names like Jeff and David. Humans have more than 40 of those. If I was given enough time,"
00:39:58,00:40:02,I could think of more than 40 names. I'm just saying it's the non-human mammal with the most
00:40:02,00:40:06,"names. No, no, no, it's not because they also have their own names. You understand there's a"
00:40:06,00:40:12,"different meaning to the word name, right? Some cougars are called Jeff. She's back by me."
00:40:12,00:40:15,Some cougars are called Jeff.
00:40:15,00:40:22,"No, the names are incredible. Like I'd never heard the name catamount, which means cat of the"
00:40:22,00:40:27,"mountain. But they also get called the deer tiger, the purple feather. I'm not sure how many people"
00:40:27,00:40:30,are using purple feather these days. Is that really one? The purple feather? That's what mountain
00:40:30,00:40:35,screamer would try to love. You wouldn't call an ambulance when you say there's a purple feather
00:40:35,00:40:39,coming at me. It's a purple feather. It feels like you'd use one of the other ones. Do you know
00:40:39,00:40:44,how you defend yourself against a cougar? We should say because it's useful. I would run. I would try
00:40:44,00:40:50,"and run. Don't run. Oh, you're dead. Okay. No, you're dead. Dan and Anna have got a guess. What?"
00:40:50,00:40:55,"Can I have another guess? Yeah, give James a quick guess. Let's say you've magically been resuscitated."
00:40:56,00:41:02,"Play dead. Play dead? Yeah. You're dead again. What? Sorry. If you play dead. Well, so I can't run"
00:41:02,00:41:07,"and I can't just stay there playing dead. No, that's right. Shotgun. Shotgun. That's the"
00:41:07,00:41:14,"Cougar Anna. Basically, don't turn around and don't look away. Make yourself big. Oh, the ace of"
00:41:14,00:41:19,"base defence. Stand your ground. You know, like stand on a rock, bear your teeth, shout anything"
00:41:19,00:41:23,"to frighten it and scare it away. Basically, and I've thought of a mnemonic for this, which I think"
00:41:23,00:41:28,"might be helpful for listeners. So just remember, if it's a mountain lion, don't be lion down."
00:41:28,00:41:32,"And that's the useful like, what if it's an actual lion? I don't know."
00:41:32,00:41:39,"I don't know. I thought you were going to say opera singing, sing opera at it."
00:41:39,00:41:44,"Yeah, because that's not on my list. There was a case of a woman who was being stalked by a cougar"
00:41:44,00:41:48,and she started hiding and she didn't know what to do. And she just got up and started just singing
00:41:48,00:41:56,"opera and the cougar just went, whoa, I'm with the cougar there. Actually, cougars really hate"
00:41:56,00:42:02,"podcasts. Really? Yeah, this was this is quite a recent study done in California, which ones name"
00:42:02,00:42:10,"and shape. Yeah, is it off menu? Come on. Do you mean it makes them angry or they just they don't"
00:42:10,00:42:17,"want to be around it? No, it puts them off the dinner. So let's say you're a cougar and off menu"
00:42:17,00:42:24,"comes on. Yeah. And he's like, James A. Castor, he's talking about his food and stuff. And they"
00:42:24,00:42:28,"would just look at their kill, their deer that they killed and just go, Oh, I don't really fancy"
00:42:28,00:42:34,"that anymore. In actual fact, the study is to check how they react to humans more generally."
00:42:34,00:42:39,Mostly men. Yeah. Mostly men. You're saying it's not a study about whether there's an untapped podcast
00:42:39,00:42:47,market out there. You astonished me. They wanted to see how they reacted to humans talking if humans
00:42:47,00:42:52,"are nearby. And what better way to do that than talk radio podcast, that kind of thing. So they"
00:42:52,00:42:59,"played some chatting humans, and they just left their food alone and just went off. And the problem"
00:42:59,00:43:04,"with this, this is really important. So if you are a cougar and you kill something and you don't"
00:43:04,00:43:09,"eat it, then that means you have to kill something else because you have to eat that. Right. And so"
00:43:09,00:43:15,this is the fact that fear really changes ecosystems. If an animal is really scared because
00:43:15,00:43:21,"there's humans around, it actually affects the ecosystem in ways you don't expect as in loads"
00:43:21,00:43:26,"of the prey will get killed. It's not just that the cougar itself is scared. Wait, sorry, the prey"
00:43:26,00:43:29,"will get killed because the cougar has to go and find something else. Yeah, because it gets put off"
00:43:29,00:43:34,"its food. So it needs to go and find something else. And then another podcast comes along, maybe"
00:43:34,00:43:38,"Chris and Rosie Rams, you start chatting to it. And then it has to go and kill another animal."
00:43:39,00:43:45,Nightmare. We're putting nature off its food. Yeah. If I'm ever attacked and just go hello and
00:43:45,00:43:52,"welcome to another episode of. Can I tell you another record that Cougars have got? Oh, yeah."
00:43:52,00:43:55,This is another Guinness World Record that Cougars have got. I'm going to quite directly. Mountain
00:43:55,00:44:00,"Lions, large hind legs have greater muscle mass than their front legs. This enables them to jump"
00:44:00,00:44:07,up to 18 feet into a tree. So they could they could leap over the statue of David. Yes. Yes.
00:44:08,00:44:12,"The highest jump on record for any mammal, any mammal, they could just jump over and lick off"
00:44:12,00:44:20,"that beeswax. It was recorded for a Puma or a mountain lion, which jumped seven meters, 23 feet,"
00:44:20,00:44:27,straight up from a standstill. They could jump into the top of an open top bus if they were walking
00:44:27,00:44:32,"alongside it. This is so amazing. Like I read another claim made by the US wildlife authorities,"
00:44:32,00:44:39,"they could jump over a school bus the long way round, like front to back. Wow. So what's the"
00:44:39,00:44:48,distance they can get? Long. I've just named a load of statistics. It's 40 feet. Okay. 17 feet
00:44:48,00:44:53,by long is what we're saying. Can I just ask a quick question? Yeah. Because this bothers me
00:44:53,00:44:59,about these kind of stats. What is the difference in length between a school bus and a bus? I wonder
00:44:59,00:45:04,"if it's slightly an evil, carnival thing, because a lot of stunts were about leaping over back to"
00:45:04,00:45:08,"back. Yeah. Transport. No, but they never said school buses. They just said buses for evil,"
00:45:08,00:45:13,"carnival, because they weren't afraid that evil carnival was going to eat their children inside"
00:45:13,00:45:18,"the bus. Whereas they always say school buses. If it's a slightly threatening animal, because it's"
00:45:18,00:45:23,"like it will leap over it and then come in the front door, buy its ticket and eat your kids."
00:45:24,00:45:29,"You don't have to buy tickets for a school bus. Yeah. Well, it's just all the faster to get on"
00:45:29,00:45:35,"with eating your children, my dear. Yeah. But they also save human lives, cougars, more human lives"
00:45:35,00:45:41,"than they end. Probably because they don't really kill, they don't kill many people at all. Very,"
00:45:41,00:45:48,very rare to get attacked by a cougar. But what they do prey on a lot is deer. And deer cause 1.2
00:45:48,00:45:54,million car crashes in America a year and killed 200 people. And they did a study which looked at
00:45:54,00:45:59,"if you were introduced cougars, how many people they'd save. And because they've eaten all the deer"
00:45:59,00:46:04,"which are hitting the cars. Exactly. It's a tough sell, though, isn't it? Yeah. When you've got this"
00:46:04,00:46:10,"animal that could jump over my school bus, come in, buy a ticket and kill all my kids. Are you"
00:46:10,00:46:20,"like, yeah, but he's going to eat a few deer. Yeah, it is. All right, I need to move us on to our"
00:46:20,00:46:26,final fact of the show. Time for a final fact of the show. And that is Andy. My fact is that nobody
00:46:26,00:46:31,knows how large the world's largest crocodile is. What they should do is get a cougar to jump over
00:46:31,00:46:40,"it. And all right, here's Cassius. So on the screen is a very large crocodile. He's called"
00:46:40,00:46:46,"Cassius. He's the largest known crocodile, because he's the largest crocodile in captivity. He is"
00:46:46,00:46:53,approximately approximately 18 feet. Which means if you stood him upright.
00:46:55,00:47:02,"That is amazing. I want to see that show where you've got one cougar, one statue of David,"
00:47:02,00:47:08,"and one enormous crocodile. God, I didn't notice that until now now."
00:47:08,00:47:14,"Channel five, if you're listening, this is big buzz. Yeah. And this is the thing, like, he's been"
00:47:14,00:47:18,"estimated that they're not sure exactly how old he is, his keepers, because they they took him in"
00:47:18,00:47:25,"about 40 years ago, 35. And they believe he might be 80. Some keepers think he might be up to 120"
00:47:25,00:47:34,"years old. Yeah, old crocodile. And he was last measured in 2011 at 18 feet. But even then when"
00:47:34,00:47:38,"they took him in, he was missing bits of his snout and his tail, because of fights or accidents or"
00:47:38,00:47:43,"whatever. And no one has tried to measure him since then. And he's probably grown, but just,"
00:47:43,00:47:47,"you know, because I think they grow their whole lives that they crocodile. So that he's probably"
00:47:47,00:47:53,"grown, but they really don't want the like the admin of measuring. He's really terrifying. He's"
00:47:53,00:47:58,"so huge. And he is terrifying. I mean, what I was thinking, what you don't want to hear about a"
00:47:58,00:48:04,"crocodile is how his carer describes him, the guy who looks after him, who's a guy called 2D Scott,"
00:48:04,00:48:12,"which is a funny name. And 2D says he still has a lot of spark in him, which is not what you want"
00:48:12,00:48:16,"at all. He says, because most crocodiles are quite disinterested, you know, they just sit there"
00:48:16,00:48:22,"like a motionless lump. But this one, when you walk in, Cassius, he every time he sees you, he"
00:48:22,00:48:29,wants to come up and say good day in his eyes. His eyes light up tragically 2D Scott was actually
00:48:29,00:48:36,called 3D Scott until an accident in the pen. He's terrifying. He's met a load of celebrities.
00:48:36,00:48:44,"Cassius. Yeah, Queen Elizabeth II. No, Xi Jinping, King of Thailand. They're not so much celebrities"
00:48:44,00:48:50,"as heads of state. Scott Morrison, who's not a head of state. He's the head of government. Queen"
00:48:50,00:48:56,"Elizabeth was the head of state at the time. But nonetheless, God, that seemed so important"
00:48:56,00:49:02,"when I said it. And as the words were leaving my mouth, I thought, who gives a toss. Has he met"
00:49:02,00:49:09,"Kim Kardashian? No data, don't know. So he hasn't been the longest for that long, has he? The longest"
00:49:09,00:49:16,"crocodile? Because there was another crocodile who I think died in 2013, who was called La Long."
00:49:16,00:49:21,"Oh, yeah. And so long, they added an extra L and O to the beginning of his name."
00:49:21,00:49:25,"They're just so astonished every time they see him, they go, he's long."
00:49:25,00:49:34,"Anyway, he was 6.13 meters a little bit longer than Cassius. And he was caught in 2011. I think"
00:49:34,00:49:39,these are taken into captivity when they're dangerous. So he'd eaten some fishermen and a
00:49:39,00:49:48,"girl, I think. And so it was a black mark against your name, I think. And so it was hunted. And"
00:49:48,00:49:52,"actually, La Long, when he was hunted, it took over 100 people to bring him on to land. He was"
00:49:52,00:49:58,really aggressive. He sort of broke his restraining rope twice. And he was named after the crocodile
00:49:58,00:50:04,"hunter in the area, whose nickname was La Long. Oh, okay. La Long died, didn't he? He did. La Long"
00:50:04,00:50:08,"died. And I imagine for the obituary, they would have gone with so long, la long."
00:50:08,00:50:20,"If you have a baby crying, let's say on a speaker, then a crocodile will run very quickly and"
00:50:20,00:50:29,aggressively towards it. To change it or feed it? I'm afraid not because then they start biting the
00:50:29,00:50:36,speaker. They're really attracted to the sound of primates crying and human babies crying the same
00:50:36,00:50:42,"way that bonobos might or chimpanzees might. And probably because they hear a baby crying,"
00:50:42,00:50:47,they think this is an easy meal. And what do these crocodiles think of the rest is politics?
00:50:47,00:50:58,Would they engage with it? I read about that study. And the most amazing thing is that they
00:50:58,00:51:03,can tell the difference between how upset a baby is more than you can. And then they'll respond
00:51:03,00:51:08,"accordingly. And the way they tested this, which I quite like, is by recording human babies screaming"
00:51:08,00:51:15,"at different levels of emergency. And you can't torture a baby for science these days. So instead,"
00:51:15,00:51:21,what they did was... Anna said with a faint tang of regret in the voice. They recorded babies
00:51:21,00:51:27,"at bath time when sometimes they cry. And then when they get vaccinated, when they cry in a bit"
00:51:27,00:51:31,"more of an emergency way... A needle, any kind of needle, yeah. Yeah, it's a bit more of someone"
00:51:31,00:51:37,"stabbing me kind of cry. And the crocodiles swim more vigorously, more fast towards the speakers"
00:51:37,00:51:42,that emit the vaccination cry. And they can tell us at a frequency difference that even we can't.
00:51:42,00:51:48,"Crocodiles, anti-vaxxers, that's what we're taking from that. I knew I never liked them."
00:51:48,00:51:54,"Can I mention very quickly, we're talking about crocodiles. Can't not mention the great Steve Irwin."
00:51:56,00:52:02,"Thank you for the silent respect. Crocodile hunter. Yeah, he was a crocodile hunter. But he"
00:52:02,00:52:07,"had Australia Zoo, and that was his big thing. He used to jump on a lot of massive crocodiles."
00:52:07,00:52:12,"And one of the things which is said about him, and there's a tiny bit of question about it,"
00:52:12,00:52:18,"but a lot of people say this is true, is that he had a Galapagos tortoise inside Australia Zoo."
00:52:18,00:52:23,And the previous owner of the tortoise was Charles Darwin. Isn't that insane?
00:52:23,00:52:29,"Oh my God, that's so cool. So she was called Harriet. She survived from the time of the Beagle"
00:52:29,00:52:34,"Expeditions all the way through to Steve Irwin's zoo, just to give you the idea of the span of"
00:52:34,00:52:39,time. And it's quite nice because Steve Irwin was definitely a huge hero of mine. There is a
00:52:39,00:52:45,minor planet out in the universe now named for him. So out there somewhere is a minor planet
00:52:45,00:52:55,"called Crikey. Something clever that crocodiles do, which is really mean and evil, is they,"
00:52:55,00:53:01,"well, I'll tell you what they do and you'll tell me why. They lie underwater and allocators do this"
00:53:01,00:53:06,as well. And they just have a little bit of their head sticking out. And then they put sticks or
00:53:06,00:53:10,branches on their head. What are they doing? They're leering human children who like to
00:53:10,00:53:17,"play pickup sticks. You're very close and that could be a secondary purpose. Oh, they're pretending"
00:53:17,00:53:22,"to be a bird's nest. So a bird will land on them and delete them. You're basically, between you,"
00:53:22,00:53:34,you're correct. A human baby flies down and picks out one of the sticks and then says Jenga.
00:53:36,00:53:42,You've gone the wrong way. It's to trick birds into thinking that they're sort of a tree because
00:53:42,00:53:46,"they look quite tree like, don't they? They look like branches and try and go and collect their"
00:53:46,00:53:50,sticks to make their nest with. So then the bird will go and land on them to pick up a stick to
00:53:50,00:53:55,make a nest. Snap. You're done. Dinner. Do you know how to measure? This is for alligators. I hope
00:53:55,00:54:01,I'm allowed a sort of slight curve. How to measure an alligator if you see one in the wild.
00:54:01,00:54:06,"So it's possible to measure an alligator in the wild, but it's not possible to measure"
00:54:06,00:54:12,"this crocodile, which is in captivity. Good point. I suppose if you're in the wild and you see an"
00:54:12,00:54:16,"alligator and you think, I wonder how big that alligator is. Okay. So you want to see, you don't"
00:54:16,00:54:21,"want to go up to it with a tape measure. So you see something else around it, which you know,"
00:54:21,00:54:25,you throw your iPhone at it. That's it. The iPhone lands on it and you work out how many
00:54:25,00:54:32,"iPhones it is. Exactly. Actually, you have to find an old pair of its shoes in its vest. Crocodile"
00:54:32,00:54:41,"shoes. That's what the song's about. No, it's so easy. And I just want to get like another little"
00:54:41,00:54:46,"tip. Yeah, you just approach it at night with a torch and then you locate the midpoint on its"
00:54:46,00:54:52,skull and you estimate the distance to the end of the nostrils. Don't wake it up. And then every
00:54:52,00:54:59,"inch of that distance is a foot of the alligator. Okay. So like if that distance is six inches,"
00:54:59,00:55:03,"you've got a six foot alligator and so on. Okay, that's clever. Crocodiles do a crazy thing where"
00:55:03,00:55:09,"they, you would think in any scenario where they live, they're like the dominant species, right?"
00:55:09,00:55:15,"And they're not. Often hippos, if they're around, are much bigger. So talking earlier about"
00:55:15,00:55:20,"crocodiles running to a baby monitor and hearing baby crying, one thing that hippos tend to use"
00:55:20,00:55:26,"them as is basically like a baby chewing toy. They'll go up and while the croc is just laying there,"
00:55:26,00:55:30,"they'll go and they'll start licking it, they'll start chewing it and the crocodile will just lay"
00:55:30,00:55:36,"there as if nothing's going on. Yeah, because if it makes any movement, it might antagonize the"
00:55:36,00:55:41,hippo into eating it. So it just has to sit there and be. Is this a baby hippo though that's chewing
00:55:41,00:55:46,"on it? Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's just, you just, it has to lay there and just be sucked on, licked on,"
00:55:46,00:55:52,"just take it. Well, not everyone has a Henry Hoovey, you know. We've all got one somehow."
00:55:53,00:55:57,"I need to wrap us up very soon. Oh, just some things on big animals. Okay, yeah."
00:55:57,00:56:03,"Seeing as that's what this was about. I was looking at big, small animals. So the largest ant,"
00:56:03,00:56:09,"the largest ant in the world is the safari ant, which is five centimeters in length,"
00:56:09,00:56:13,which is the same length as David's penis if he was human sized.
00:56:13,00:56:18,"If he was human sized, okay. So if you can imagine a human with the world's largest ant,"
00:56:18,00:56:24,"where your penis would be. Yeah. Yes. That's David. That's really helpful. Thank you, James."
00:56:24,00:56:31,"The world's longest insect in total is a stick insect. They found one in China,"
00:56:31,00:56:39,"which was 24.6 inches in total length, which means that you couldn't legally use her as a rounder's"
00:56:39,00:56:48,"bat. So good. Anything else before we, Anna, you all again? I've just, all I can think about now"
00:56:48,00:56:52,"is giant house spiders, because I've had a real problem with spiders lately. So we've been talking"
00:56:52,00:57:00,"about big animals, but they are the biggest. And genuinely, there was one in my room the other day,"
00:57:00,00:57:05,"and after an hour and a half of staring at it, I was on my own and eventually managing to kill it"
00:57:05,00:57:10,"with the longest object I could find, me at one end, it at the other. And they don't die, obviously,"
00:57:10,00:57:15,so that its legs are so wriggling. They don't die. They die. They can't. It's not possible to kill them.
00:57:15,00:57:23,They don't die. And it was two in the morning. I was on my own. This newborn baby was next door.
00:57:23,00:57:28,My newborn baby was next door and asleep. And you know how like the worst thing that can possibly
00:57:28,00:57:35,happen if you have a baby is that it wakes up and then it's legs. There were three legs still
00:57:35,00:57:40,"moving over the thing that I crushed it with. And I screamed at the top of my lungs, no, no, no,"
00:57:40,00:57:48,"you can't be alive. You can't be alive. Please die. And anyway, so I looked up how to deter"
00:57:48,00:57:54,spiders and you can draw lines of chalk everywhere. So apparently they don't like the taste of chalk
00:57:54,00:57:59,"and they taste with their legs. Like it's all over there. I thought you meant like drawing an outline,"
00:57:59,00:58:04,"like emergency. Yeah, yeah. Whoa, this person kills spiders. Let's get out of here, man."
00:58:04,00:58:16,"Okay, that is it. That is all of our facts. Thank you so much for listening to our 500th episode,"

00:58:33,00:58:38,"pick it up and he'll text me and I'll ignore it. Yeah, we can get us on a group account at no such"
00:58:38,00:58:42,"thing. You can also find our website, no such thing as a fish.com where all of our previous"
