00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,320
 Hi everybody, Andy here. Just a couple of announcements before we start this week's show.

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:08,320
 The first announcement is that as you will see from the episode number here,

3
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:15,360
 this is the 500th episode of No Such Thing as a Fish. And we just wanted to say we are so thrilled

4
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:21,040
 to have made it to 500. We definitely didn't think we would when we started this in 2014.

5
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:24,800
 And we wanted to say thank you to all of you for listening. We know loads of you have been

6
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:28,480
 listening for many years. Plenty of you have been listening right from the get-go. And whether

7
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:32,720
 you've listened to 500 episodes or whether you've just started, we wanted to say a huge thank you.

8
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:37,360
 It would not have happened without you and we're thrilled you're here. This show is a very special

9
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:42,320
 one. It was recorded live at the London Podcast Festival. And as many of you know, we've been

10
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:47,440
 having lots of guests to cover. Anna on maternity leave. This time we pulled out all the stops.

11
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:52,880
 And our special guest is a name that will be familiar to many of you because it's Anna. Anna

12
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:57,840
 Tadinski is back everybody. She's back. She's better than ever. She insults us all in the first

13
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:02,400
 three minutes of the recording. We really hope you enjoy this show. And Anna will be back full

14
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:06,800
 time in another month or so. The second announcement is about a very exciting new book that's been

15
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:13,280
 published. It's called Everything to Play for the QI Book of Sports. And its authors are none other

16
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:18,400
 than James Arkin and Anna Tadinski of this podcast. That's right. James and Anna have written their

17
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:24,560
 first joint book without me in Dan with. It's a brilliant book. It's a history of basically the

18
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:29,520
 entire world through the medium of sport. So it's great for people who like sport, but it's also

19
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:33,680
 great for people who don't think of themselves as sport lovers. I don't think of myself as a sport

20
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:38,480
 lover, but I'm reading it now and I'm absolutely engrossed. I'm learning fantastic new things on

21
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:44,160
 every single page. If you know someone who likes sport or if you like this podcast, you will love

22
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:49,440
 this book. It is absolutely full of mad, bizarre, wonderful niche things about the biggest sports

23
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:53,760
 in the world and the smallest ones and everything else in between. James and Anna have also read

24
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:58,480
 out the audiobook. So if you'd like to listen to them reading it, that's like a huge bumper

25
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:03,360
 bonus episode of Fish. That can be done too. Once again, it's called Everything to Play for,

26
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:08,160
 the QI Book of Sports. Get it now. Get one for yourself and one for someone else at Christmas.

27
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,560
 That's it. Hope you enjoy it on with the show.

28
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:17,360
 [Music]

29
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:34,880
 Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to a very special edition of No Such Thing as a Fish, our 500th

30
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:45,200
 show.

31
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:55,200
 And then, yes, it turns out you get to run over by a tree.

32
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,520
 Oh my god, I'm just around in a fight.

33
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:09,840
 Yes, yes, yes.

34
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:20,160
 [Music]

35
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:30,480
 [Applause]

36
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:40,800
 [Music]

37
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:55,600
 Good evening, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to King's Place. Please welcome to the stage. No

38
00:03:55,600 --> 00:04:03,920
 such thing as a fish.

39
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:11,520
 Hey, everyone. Thanks so much for coming, everyone, tonight. How are you doing?

40
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:21,760
 Fuck yes. All right. Call the music, please. So we are so excited to be here tonight for our

41
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:30,320
 500th episode. We are, thank you so much. We've been having a lot of guests over the last nine

42
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:35,120
 months to come on in Place of Anna because she's away of maternity, and so we've had a lot of fun.

43
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:42,880
 Arguably the show's been better, I would say. It's felt stronger. Yeah. I'm joking, guys.

44
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:46,400
 Do you think I'd ever say that? I've actually heard that. She'd kick my fucking ass.

45
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:52,560
 So, yeah, anyway, we've been having amazing guests coming on, but we thought for the 500th episode,

46
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:57,040
 we need a big gun. We need someone who's going to really deliver the goods. Unfortunately,

47
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:03,040
 we've found someone a rookie. So please make a feel welcome, kind of guide her in. Please welcome

48
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:08,080
 the stage. Ladies and gentlemen, it is the return of Anna Tyshynski.

49
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:28,160
 [APPLAUSE]

50
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:31,760
 What a funny ruse, Dan. What a hilarious little gag there.

51
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:41,200
 We're back. Shit. Can I just say, no intro music for me, huge, ridiculously disproportionate buildup

52
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:46,880
 that's like welcoming Neil Armstrong back from the moon style buildup, and then no, no intro music

53
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:53,200
 for the super special, most exciting guest you've ever had on. Okay. Just a little director's note.

54
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:56,560
 Well, let's see how you do in this episode, and we might have you back for more.

55
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:03,600
 Thanks. All right. So we got a wheel ready to go. Shall we do it? 500th episode. All right. Okay.

56
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,280
 Let's roll theme tune.

57
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:23,520
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast this

58
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:33,920
 week coming to you from the London podcast festival. My name is Dan Schreiber. I am sitting

59
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:38,880
 here with James Harkin, Andrew Hunter Murray, and ladies and gentlemen, it is the return of Anna

60
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:47,600
 Tyshynski. And once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts

61
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:54,080
 for this very special 500th episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, and in no particular order,

62
00:06:54,080 --> 00:07:01,040
 here we go. Starting with fact number one, and that is my fact. My fact this week is that in

63
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:07,440
 preparation for the 500th anniversary of the creation of Michelangelo's David, the people in

64
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:12,880
 charge of cleaning him had a huge falling out because they couldn't agree if he should be washed

65
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:21,760
 or dry cleaned. This was a big deal. There was 10 years of preparation for this big

66
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:26,160
 birthday that was coming up, but the one thing that they couldn't decide on near the end was

67
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:30,240
 how do you actually do the cleaning process itself? From the image behind us, it looks like

68
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:36,640
 he's been hoovered. Well, so this is after a decision has been made and a vacuum was involved,

69
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:42,480
 yes. I see. And also I haven't seen Michelangelo's David. Is he really, really big or is the person

70
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:48,480
 doing it a tiny little borrower? He's 17 foot, which I'm told by the internet is the average

71
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:54,480
 size of a giraffe. If you want to picture that, because we've all seen a giraffe. Well, no, I

72
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:58,960
 have. I've just realized I have. Sorry. That's why I say no. Yeah, they've got one at the zoo. Yeah.

73
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:04,560
 But they don't have one of these at the zoo. No. That's how you can tell the difference in many.

74
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:09,680
 Take a tell if you're in the zoo or in Florence. Yeah. What if you're in Florence?

75
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:13,840
 So it's, yeah, that's the, that's the one test case, which doesn't work because they've got both.

76
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:21,680
 Yeah. Has it always been this slick? It's not director's commentary. No, it is amazing.

77
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:25,600
 In fact, the, so for the people listening at home that we've got a picture here of the lady who's

78
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:30,080
 cleaning him, I think her name might be Eleonora Pucci, because she's the lady who currently

79
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:35,600
 cleans David. And she was interviewed about it this year. And she does it every two months.

80
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:39,040
 And she photographs him very carefully to see where basically where the dust is and whether

81
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:44,480
 any extra grime has accumulated. And then she, she dusts it and she has the special vacuum cleaner

82
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:49,840
 designed for statues, which I had no idea was even a thing. And she, she gets on a scaffold

83
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:53,760
 and she has this backpack vacuum cleaner and just hoops him. I just thought it was a low

84
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:58,160
 pressure vacuum. Is it designed for statues? It's not just a crap vacuum cleaner. It's a Henry.

85
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:04,640
 Okay. Henry is high pressure. Is it famously? Yeah. I think my vacuum cleaner, I might have

86
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:09,360
 accidentally bought a statue vacuum cleaner. Can't even get rid of a cobweb thread. But yeah,

87
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:13,440
 I think there might be some jealousy amongst the other statues. Cause did you read, I think it was

88
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:18,880
 the comment from her when she said, we dust the other statues four times a year, but his majesty

89
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:26,160
 gets the treatment every two months. After they did the big restoration, I was reading an interview

90
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:32,000
 with a member of the team called Antonio Pallucci. And he said, only someone with expert

91
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,960
 knowledge and a thorough and long familiarity with the statue will be able to tell that

92
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:42,160
 certain irregularities are no longer there. Okay. And I'm just thinking that that's what I would

93
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:48,000
 say if I hadn't done it. Yes. Oh, you can't say it. Well, that's because you're not an expert.

94
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,680
 If you're an expert, you'd be able to see what I've done. Yeah. They got so angry about it,

95
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:57,040
 didn't they? There was so much drama. Like someone, someone resigned over which cleaning method

96
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:00,800
 they were going to use. Can we talk about what is the difference in statue terms? Cause I'm not

97
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,840
 even sure what the difference is in clothes terms between washing and dry cleaning. What's the

98
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:08,800
 difference in statutes? Okay. Well, okay. Um, so what I'm going to tell you has a lot of gaps

99
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:17,520
 because I don't understand it, but, um, roughly what I'm about to tell you roughly, it's very

100
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:22,560
 hard to clean a statue. Okay. That's one of the big problems. You're not even dealing with the

101
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:26,560
 grime that it's accumulated over the past. It's about the previous cleaning methods that have

102
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:31,440
 messed up the statue. So you're kind of dealing with the problems of the past. So, so David was

103
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:37,920
 cleaned in the 1800s at some time and then nothing until 2004 or three when they were getting ready

104
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:44,000
 for the big 500 anniversary. So if you use anything that's wet on it, you're going to be making things

105
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,800
 worse. Whereas the brush is just a light thing. So is that dry cleaning? The dry cleaning is the

106
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:54,080
 brush. The vacuuming is the, is the dry cleaning. A wet cleaning would be washing machine, soapy

107
00:10:54,080 --> 00:11:00,480
 water, soapy water, a big car. I'll imagine a car wash with the David Cakes. Yeah. So, but

108
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:04,400
 you had these two people. You had the director of the museum who was going for one side. You had

109
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:08,240
 the person who was brought in arguing for the other side. And then there was an international

110
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:13,520
 body of artists who were protesting and writing letters saying, let them just stay dirty. They

111
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:18,400
 didn't want them cleaned at all. Yeah. So it's, uh, why do we want them to stay dirty? Is that

112
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:23,040
 because I think in case of a case of damage, yeah, because they did in the olden days, didn't

113
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:26,400
 they? Like they cleaned in with hydrochloric acid, I think that time in the 19th century,

114
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:32,080
 yeah, which really screwed them up. Yeah. Wow. Have you heard of, uh, natural enzyme cleaning?

115
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:35,840
 No, what's that? There's a thing that lots of curators do and it's basically spitting on the

116
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:41,440
 artworks that you, oh yeah. Yeah. They don't actually spit that. I think, well, the good ones

117
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:46,400
 don't spit on the artworks. Basically you use, you, you lick a cotton bud and then you use that.

118
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:50,160
 But, uh, but during COVID, they stopped this practice, but loads of really senior people

119
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:54,960
 but it's so safe. That's the thing. It's so, it's one of those things which was a bit,

120
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:59,520
 it was a bit overkill. Yeah. People aren't going licking David, are they? Exactly. Unless visitors

121
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:03,760
 are actually licking the thing, then it was, it is totally safe. So if you are in the National

122
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:09,520
 Gallery and you spit on a painting, is that defense, do you think? When they come around

123
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:14,080
 and say, we said not to go near it, I think you can probably say, I'm just cleaning,

124
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:20,080
 my lease or whatever. Who's not in the National Gallery? I know. Yeah. It's worth trying, I think.

125
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:24,960
 If you do anything. Do you know, so one of the few things that were on David that needed cleaning,

126
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:32,800
 there was beeswax on him. Really? Why would there be beeswax? Because, because bees have made a,

127
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:40,000
 made a hive inside his butt crack. Good call. No. Yeah. Um, I'd say the same answer was James.

128
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:47,440
 Yeah. Correct. Yeah. Sometimes I just need to hear it a second time. So beeswax is used to,

129
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:52,880
 that's a cleaning product, isn't it? That's, that's why. Yeah, you get beeswax to clean with. Yeah,

130
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:57,440
 presumably. So they're not entirely sure, but what they think it is, is that back in the day,

131
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:01,840
 pre-electricity, when people were coming to see, and they were on, let's say, a higher ledge to

132
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:07,680
 look over it, the candles that they were holding to get a better view was melting on top of David.

133
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:13,920
 And so they found 15 splashes of beeswax. He was actually bald originally, wasn't he?

134
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:18,960
 That's all just wax accumulated. It is weird, isn't it? That, because it's David, David is

135
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:26,720
 famously a smaller person in the story. Yeah. He's so big. Have you not seen the Goliath statue?

136
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:34,240
 It's next star. Oh, wow. In the zoo. How many? There's one thing in particular that I have in

137
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:38,960
 common with David, the statue. Can you guess what that is? Not the penis.

138
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:47,040
 What do we know about it? You make your wife whoop you every day before you go to work.

139
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:53,040
 We have a lot of suction on our Henry.

140
00:13:53,040 --> 00:14:00,240
 It's very much a three-person relationship. I need my wife and Henry.

141
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,680
 That's why he's smiling all the time.

142
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:10,880
 What do you have the same as him? Does he have the face blindness thing that you have?

143
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:18,160
 Because he looks like he doesn't recognize anyone. He's mad at us so many times. Look at

144
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:22,160
 him. He's like, who are you? I know you. I'll be honest, you're not going to get this. We would

145
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:29,440
 both collapse if we were tilted forward 15 degrees. Is that not the case with all of us?

146
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:33,840
 No, so a normal human will fall over after about 20 degrees of tilt.

147
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:39,120
 Who got your big head? Is that what it is?

148
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:45,680
 He's got cracks on his ankles and if you tilt him, his ankles will absolutely collapse.

149
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:52,720
 And I tried this. I videoed myself at home leaning forward until I fell over and then paused it and

150
00:14:52,720 --> 00:15:00,240
 then measured exactly where I stopped. Did you really? Your wife's next door? Darling, Henry and I are waiting.

151
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:06,080
 And it turns out that I can't get much further than 15 either.

152
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:10,720
 I just want to be clear. I meant you've got a physically big head, not a metaphorically big

153
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:17,600
 head. Because that's better, I think. Oh, here's the thing. Michelangelo. Or are you calling Michelangelo

154
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:24,160
 or Michelangelo? What do you prefer? Michelangelo. Yeah, I think calling by the name that everyone

155
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:36,800
 knows him by. Okay. Yeah. Okay. So he was shorter than real life David. I want to say real life David.

156
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:44,480
 He was just 16 feet. Yeah. No, I'm so sorry. So David in the Bible, the thing is the Bible doesn't

157
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:48,800
 say the height and weight classes of David and Goliath before they went into the fight. But

158
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:53,600
 there are lots of sort of biblical scholars who've had a rough, had a go at it. They think

159
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:58,320
 he, some think he might be five foot three. And Michelangelo was five two. But we only know that

160
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:03,200
 because shoes were found in his house. And they basically measured from the shoes. They assessed

161
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:07,760
 how tall, like if his shoes are this big, then he's this big. So how big was he?

162
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:12,640
 Five two. He's five foot three. So that's about the same as Lady Gaga or Yuri Gagarin.

163
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:16,960
 Right. And he would be too short to be an Emirates airline flight attendant.

164
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:22,960
 This is one of those studies, whoever came up with that, that is one of the many reasons I left

165
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:30,160
 this show originally. Shoes back in the olden days were not measured with that kind of precision.

166
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:33,920
 A, that meant you could judge someone's height. And then B, you do get to all people with small

167
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:38,560
 feet. Yeah, it's, it's, it's an asset. Also, we don't know if they were his shoes. But yeah,

168
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:44,880
 they were found in his home. So, you know, yeah. Could have been a servant, could have been his

169
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:47,760
 wife. Could have been a servant, could have been his wife. I'm not sure if there was a Mrs. Michelangelo.

170
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:52,240
 I don't know. Right. I think so. I think a lot of people think that he liked men.

171
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:59,360
 And Michelangelo. Yes. And one of the reasons, fancied men, I mean, and one of the reasons

172
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:05,200
 is that his female sculptures often seem to be men with breasts. And a lot of people have looked

173
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:10,080
 into it and you should like look up Michelangelo female drawings and sculptures. They are,

174
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:15,040
 they're just men. It's like Arnold Schwarzenegger. And then with a sort of pair of lemons jammed

175
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:21,760
 onto the front. It's so weird. You know, there's a theory as to why his penis is so small. Have

176
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:32,960
 you read that? David's. No, James. Look, after all those nights with Henry, as dark as it used to be.

177
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:42,080
 Oh, dear. Okay. So he famously has a small penis. Yeah. What is it called? No, it's so I thought

178
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:51,280
 you said, what is it called? Jeff, it's a private thing. No, so there was a study done and someone

179
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:56,400
 who read this study kind of pulled this out as a, as I don't think the authors of the study was

180
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:02,480
 specifically saying it, but they read from the detail. It's because he's about to fight a fucking

181
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:08,400
 giant and he's terrified. Right. Right. So his penis has shrunk in terror. And that's, that's

182
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:14,880
 Michelangelo showing that, um, yeah, like it was an adrenaline thing, isn't it? The body,

183
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:20,400
 the body doesn't remove blood from where it's not needed at the moment and puts it in, you know,

184
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:24,320
 like muscles for fight or flight and things like that. Your body doesn't suck it up so that it

185
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:30,240
 doesn't get hurt in the battle. That would be great. The actual penis on this statue is

186
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:37,280
 about six inches in length. So, you know, it's not, not small by real terms, but someone on

187
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:47,280
 Reddit called bendy, bendy spine. He worked out that in real life, if David was brought down to

188
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:54,640
 real size, he would be just under five centimeters. And that means according to standard UK guidelines,

189
00:18:54,640 --> 00:19:02,000
 he would be considered a candidate for penile lengthening surgery. I noticed though he's

190
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:08,720
 converted it to centimeters to make it sound bigger. Yeah, there are a number of standard

191
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:14,880
 maneuvers you can pull. That's sure. But also it's not, it's not, it's not, um, it's not up. No,

192
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:18,560
 so it's faster. Yeah. But is that, is that, is that the measurement under which you qualify?

193
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:24,640
 Not, I don't need to ask. I'm not asking the fact. So let's just, you know, um, I'll set

194
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:33,840
 your legs up for the show. Thank you very much. Cheers. It is time for fact number two, and that

195
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:41,200
 is Anna. My fact is that having 10 fingers and no thumbs is very useful for playing the piano.

196
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:48,160
 Okay. Yeah. So if anyone's got that in the audience, then take up the piano. Okay. So how

197
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:54,960
 do you end up with? Uh, so this is a condition, a rare condition, sure. But it's where you can be

198
00:19:54,960 --> 00:20:00,000
 born with, um, no thumbs and instead of thumbs, you have fingers and I just find all this stuff so

199
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:05,760
 interesting. So it's little tweaks in our genes. So we have genes that specify like the position

200
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:09,520
 of things in our body and they're called hox genes. So that says like your arm goes on your

201
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:14,560
 shoulder, your foot goes on your leg. It's like funny bones. That book is kind of like that,

202
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:20,480
 the hox gene. And if the hox gene gets a mutation in it, then you might end up with something in

203
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:25,120
 the wrong place. And so if there's a particular mutation, you might end up with a finger as your

204
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:33,360
 thumb. And I happen to read two accounts. One is of a woman who had this five finger trait in 1957.

205
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:38,240
 I actually initially read this in a book called quirks of human anatomy, an evo devo look at the

206
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:43,760
 human body, which is so interesting. And I would recommend anyway. Yep. She said she didn't think

207
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:47,520
 of it as a disability. It didn't hold her back in any way. And actually it meant that she played

208
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:53,520
 the piano more easily. And then there was a Reddit AMA quite recently with a man who has

209
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:58,480
 the same symptom. And again, he's a professional musician and he said it makes me better at the

210
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:02,720
 piano. Really? Now I know they don't know how good they would have been at the piano if they'd

211
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:08,880
 had eight fingers and two thumbs, but wait, hang on. Have you got two joints? You've got, um,

212
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:13,440
 I think it varies a little bit, but one of them had one of them was opposable and the other wasn't.

213
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:18,160
 Because some people get this is a trifalangeal thumb. That's what it's called. And it's where

214
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:23,920
 your thumb has three phalanges. Those are the bones inside your fingers instead of two. So it

215
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:27,040
 might give you a longer thumb, but it might also give you a weaker thumb. And often those are not

216
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:31,840
 opposable, which is a pain. That is a pain. So it's useful very much on piano. It lies in on a flat

217
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:37,040
 surface, but not on a, you know, another environment like a guitar, which is weird because this guy

218
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:42,080
 also played the guitar and said it was useful for that. It sounds like he's a really sunny guy.

219
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:49,840
 Like, yeah, he's making it work. It's amazing. In the, um, report about this woman in 1957,

220
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:54,720
 the woman with the five, five fingers on each hand, it said that she came into hospital because she

221
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:59,120
 was giving birth and that's when they documented her. And then it said her newborn was the same.

222
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:06,960
 So we think the trait is probably genetic. That's a proper scientist. It's not like those

223
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:10,320
 chances. He found a shoe in Michelangelo's house and said, Oh, well, we think he was five foot

224
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:19,120
 two, actually. Do you guys think a thumb is a finger? No. Yeah. For the audience, is the thumb

225
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:30,080
 a finger? Yes. Is it not? Pretty evenly match. Well, it's a good job. You guys aren't finger surgeons

226
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:36,240
 because this is a problem in finger surgery that some surgeons count a thumb as a finger

227
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:42,720
 and some don't. And if you say to someone, you need to remove the fourth finger on someone's hand.

228
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:47,280
 There have been cases where people have counted from the thumb when they shouldn't have done

229
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:51,600
 and they've taken the wrong finger. Stop it. Really? That has happened. We've invented so

230
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:57,280
 much stuff as a species. We kind of like the label to go, that's crazy. Well, there are a few papers

231
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:02,080
 that have talked about this and most of them say we should call them index finger, ring finger,

232
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:07,360
 all that kind of stuff and that will remove any problems. But as late as 2009 was the last paper

233
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:12,640
 that this came in in the Canadian Medical Journal, who said we really need to stop saying fourth finger

234
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:16,720
 or third finger or whatever. I mean, for instance, you could be counting from this way or from this

235
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:22,240
 way. Yeah. No, who starts with a little finger? That's like people who say a potato. They just don't

236
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:29,600
 exist. Or Michelangelo. Yeah, exactly. They should have a like this little piggy system.

237
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:34,640
 Yeah, like which little piggy the piggy who had roast beef there? We all know which piggy we're

238
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:38,960
 talking about. There's not usually toes. Yeah, God, you're a terrible surgeon.

239
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:43,680
 Great news. Got both little piggies. Won't be needing those middle fingers again. What?

240
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:48,160
 Back in the 19th century, they used to use fingers as a way of determining quite a few

241
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:52,560
 medical things. And one of the things was, are you dead? How did they do that? So one of the

242
00:23:52,560 --> 00:24:01,680
 things was there was a guy who's a French doctor, Leon Collonges. It's like being on the backs of

243
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:08,240
 the sand, isn't it? Oh, lovely. I can't say Collonges. It reads like colon juice. I can't.

244
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:16,000
 Collonges. Join me to read out your facts. Yeah, yeah, please. Leon. Leon Smith.

245
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:23,600
 His way he believed of confirming if someone was dead, I think they were quite nervous about

246
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:27,280
 actually if someone was dead in a coma, if there's if their stats were just lower,

247
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:31,840
 we didn't have the technology was to take a finger. He would take their finger and he would put it in

248
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:38,480
 his ear. And he would listen for a buzz, because they sort of thought that the body just emitted

249
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:42,240
 a buzz when it was still alive. So he would sit there and he would take their finger, put it in

250
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:48,320
 his ear and say, no, he's dead. But wait a minute, fingers don't emit buzzes. So does he just think

251
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:52,960
 that everyone's dead when he puts a finger in the ear? I mean, you know, this was a time where

252
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:57,920
 he was developing a theory and obviously he wasn't. I do know this is about when they didn't know

253
00:24:57,920 --> 00:25:02,160
 whether they didn't really know about the pulse and brain activity in the way they do now. And

254
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:07,760
 there were competitions to see which doctors could come up with a guaranteed way of determining

255
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:12,640
 whether. Yeah, I think we still don't really know when the brain is dead compared to the rest of

256
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:16,720
 the body. Yeah, but they did have all and this was one method and they had another was to put an

257
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:22,000
 insect in the patient's ear, I think or nose. It must have been like who can resist. Okay.

258
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:27,840
 If you don't know that, you're dead. And then another finger based one from the 18th century

259
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:33,040
 was if someone was in a coma or potentially dead, you would cut their finger off. And yeah,

260
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:38,800
 and the idea was you'd cut it off and they'd be like, whoa. And they'd either wake up from death

261
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:44,480
 or from a coma. So that was another method. Yeah. Do you know just speaking of bodies giving off

262
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:49,680
 buzzing sounds? I remember reading ages ago, you know, tinnitus. Yeah. Obviously is when you can

263
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:54,400
 hear a buzzing in your ear. Some people have a form of tinnitus where they emit a buzzing.

264
00:25:54,400 --> 00:26:00,400
 If you get really close as the ENT surgeon, you can be like, yep, you're right. You've got tinnitus.

265
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:06,080
 That must be really annoying. And isn't that insane? It's crazy. Wow. But I wouldn't hear,

266
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:09,280
 like I wouldn't hear your tinnitus and go, God, I've got tinnitus because I was sitting too

267
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:13,440
 close to you. No, you'd be able to hear it if you were confused it as my own. No, because I would

268
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:16,640
 leave the room and then you go, God, it's so weird. My tinnitus only appears when Anna comes in.

269
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:20,880
 I do usually get a weird headache when you are around.

270
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:28,240
 That's perfectly normal. Can I tell you about Joe Swarbrick? Yeah. Joe Swarbrick was a

271
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:34,160
 Belfast man who lost a finger in the luckiest way imaginable. Oh, okay. So one that he wouldn't

272
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:39,280
 have otherwise needed. I actually don't know that. Oh, okay. No, I like your thinking. A lucky

273
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:43,520
 finger to have lost. It's more about the circumstances under which he lost the finger.

274
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:48,240
 And he's called Swarbrick. That won't help you. Are you sure? I don't know. I was thinking people

275
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:52,720
 used to be named after things that they'd done and he may have sworn at someone with his middle

276
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:57,120
 finger and then a brick took it out. It's gone. Brilliant. I've missed the theorizing. Nope. That's

277
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:03,120
 not it. Okay. He was in a job where he only ever had to count to nine. Yeah, that's it. So he was

278
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:09,520
 trying to travel to Canada. Okay. Is that a clue? Barely. Like, Oh, barely. Is this something to

279
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:15,280
 with bears? No. Oh, okay. And he and his brother wanted, he wanted to go with his brother from

280
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:23,600
 Belfast to Canada. Yeah. Okay. And he found a job. Oh, Titanic. Titanic. He found a job on a ship.

281
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:27,360
 But sadly, at Southampton, there was an accident in the end room, lost his finger,

282
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:30,080
 yet they had to kick him off the ship and they said, and take your brother with you too. His

283
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:36,080
 brother escorted him off the ship and that ship was the Titanic. Wow. Yeah. Why did the brother

284
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:42,320
 have to go from the version I read unclear? I guess. Wait, you've got a brother, Dan. You're

285
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:48,000
 working with him on a job. His finger in an awful accident gets chopped off. Yeah. He needs to be

286
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,120
 escorted away from where you work in the job. You'd be like, Well, mate, I still want to do my

287
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:57,680
 holiday. So hang on, is it go with him? Wouldn't you? Is it on launch day? It's it's out Southampton

288
00:27:57,680 --> 00:28:01,520
 at that point. Yeah. So it's just before it was just before it's really just you would have got on,

289
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:09,040
 wouldn't you? Oh, it's the Titanic. I'm going to send a postcard. How's the finger? Yeah.

290
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:18,960
 You won't send a postcard, you know, spoiler alert. Okay. Yeah, that's a good story. And then he

291
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:23,360
 was in the Navy in both World Wars and he lived until the fifties. Oh, wow. He was injured in the

292
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:27,360
 Second World War as well. He was really, yeah, he was very so he went back to sea and still risked

293
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:33,520
 his life then. Wow. After that for impressive and the brother. This guy's getting shafted and more

294
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:39,120
 shafted in this story. He's kicked off his job because his idiot brother loses a finger. Next

295
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:44,560
 fingerless guy goes on to World War hero. He's written out a history. He actually I'm sorry.

296
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:48,960
 Joe Swalbrick himself did get an OBE for his work, not even in the war, just being a great guy in

297
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:55,840
 shipping. So yeah, no word on the brother. That's a fucking rough deal, man. You really take

298
00:28:55,840 --> 00:29:00,640
 in sides of which brother you are. Yeah, that's it. Yeah, you're the brother here. Stay on the

299
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:06,160
 boat that's going to sink. That's what I say. Wow. Do you guys know what kind of finger a

300
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:13,600
 masculitane is? Say it again. Masculitane. Masculitane. No idea. You're not going to get it.

301
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:18,560
 Is it like an animal finger or is it a? No, it's not. I'm just going to tell you. It's a finger

302
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:30,240
 that's under your armpit. Oh, and can you beckon with it? Yeah, because that is the greatest

303
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:37,920
 thing that I have. I have to. This is awful, but I have to explain for people listening to the

304
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:45,600
 podcast what just happened. Andy is giving me the come to bed finger underneath his armpit.

305
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:50,000
 I haven't been so around since I saw that smile on Henry's face.

306
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:58,240
 Oh, dear. Oh, gosh. It's not a means of seduction. I don't know why you think exposing your armpit

307
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:01,680
 would usually be a means of seduction. Well, normally, if you're getting to exposing your

308
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:06,720
 armpit, things are getting pretty hot and heavy, aren't they? Do you go to the beach and go, "Wow,

309
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:13,760
 these people want it?" Normally in a three-piece tweed suit, you know, I'm heavily dressed down

310
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:18,160
 for this. Yeah. You cut the holes, don't you? And then it's armed off if you like someone.

311
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:23,520
 It's nothing to do with that. Is that another genetic quote? No, this is actually something

312
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:27,840
 in ancient Greece. And I came across this in a study that was called armpitting among the

313
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:33,760
 ancient Greeks. And basically, it was where if you'd killed someone, then you would cut their

314
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:38,960
 finger off and shove it under their armpit. Oh. And we're not quite sure why they did this. We

315
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:44,240
 think maybe it's either offering it to the gods as like a, "Sorry, I killed this person. Please

316
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:50,640
 forgive me. Have their finger thing," which seems a bit kind of on the nose. Or it means that the

317
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:54,480
 dead person can't take vengeance in the next world because they don't have a finger. But...

318
00:30:54,480 --> 00:31:01,520
 Can you point out the guy who killed you? No. Anyway, this was so common, also known, that there

319
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:06,320
 was a specific word, which was masculine, which would literally mean stuff under the armpit,

320
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:09,520
 which refers to fingers under an armpit. Fingers tucked into an armpit.

321
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:14,320
 Weird. Or sorry, "Maskalizmata" is the stuff under the armpit. "Maskalitzane" is to put a

322
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:19,680
 finger under the armpit again. Do you know what animal has like the longest finger?

323
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:27,280
 Is it the Madagascar, the eye? The eye, you got it. So if you ever see an image of an eye,

324
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:32,080
 they're like a really cute little primate thing, but they've got this really, really long finger

325
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:37,600
 that's almost as long as their, probably their whole head, maybe a bit more even. And the interesting

326
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:44,960
 thing about that is they love to pick their nose. And when they pick their nose, they go all the way

327
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:50,720
 in. And no one could work out exactly what was going on because where does your finger go? If

328
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:55,600
 your finger is, let's say human finger is three times longer at least, and you're putting it all

329
00:31:55,600 --> 00:32:01,840
 the way up your nose, where is the finger going to end up? A bit in the brain. Or in the eye.

330
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:07,760
 Exactly. That's what you think, right? So they did a CT scan on an eye who was picking her nose.

331
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:14,080
 And they turned out that actually it kind of goes into the nose through the sinuses and then

332
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:19,680
 down into the back of the throat. And this is... You can get rid of phlegm as well as snot.

333
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:25,840
 Is that what it's for? It's almost like that, almost as disgusting as that. In fact, perhaps more

334
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:30,160
 disgusting than that. Basically, they think that what they're doing is picking their nose

335
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:36,400
 and then they're eating it, but they don't have to go through the mouth. Oh, brilliant.

336
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:42,320
 So it doesn't get stuck in their teeth? Secret bogey eating. I'm saving. I would argue not that

337
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:46,800
 secret. And what's secret until those bloody scientists came along with their CT scanner?

338
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:53,200
 What a great scam, rumbled. We need to evolve that. We will eventually, socially, so that you'll

339
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:58,320
 never know who's eating their bogeys and who isn't. We will no longer be socially ashamed.

340
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:00,560
 They will no longer be socially ashamed, those people.

341
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:16,320
 It is time for fact number three and that is James. Okay, my fact this week is that in the late 1950s,

342
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:22,640
 a woman called Cougar Annie put an advert in a newspaper looking for a younger man to marry.

343
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:27,840
 But that isn't why she got her nickname. She was just really good at killing Cougars.

344
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:36,960
 There she is on our screen for people at home. She was one of the most badass people that I've

345
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:42,640
 ever read about. She lived on Vancouver Island. Long story short, we'll get into it all, but

346
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:49,040
 basically she was married to an opium addict and she lived in Vancouver and to escape the opium dens

347
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:54,880
 of Vancouver. You know those famous opium dens of Vancouver. Her family moved to this really

348
00:33:54,880 --> 00:34:00,080
 remote area of Vancouver Island and she spent her whole time clearing the lands, so getting rid of

349
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:05,280
 all the shrubbery, getting rid of all the any kind of wild animals that came to protect herself and

350
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:12,400
 protect her family. She often had to kill them and according to reports obituaries and stuff like

351
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:19,040
 that, she definitely shot at least 60 Cougars in her life, mostly in self-defense, but then later

352
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:24,240
 the government started giving money to people who did it because they wanted to have more humans living

353
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:29,280
 in that area, so she was making money from it as well. Some contemporary obituaries said that she

354
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:35,840
 shot more than 100 Cougars in her lifetime and she also got 80 bears as well. But yeah, she was

355
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:40,880
 basically going to this area where no humans lived and she was just trying to clear the area so she

356
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:45,200
 could live there. And so her husband dies. She has three kids and she decides I want to look for

357
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:50,320
 another husband. So in 1936, she advertises... Oh, this is sorry, there are two separate occasions

358
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:54,240
 on which she advertised for a younger husband. Yeah, this is the first one, but she used the

359
00:34:54,240 --> 00:35:00,880
 same advert both times. Exactly. Yeah, 1936, the Western producer, which is where she advertised it,

360
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:07,680
 she said, "BC widow with nursery and orchard wishes partner, widower preferred, object matrimony."

361
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:14,160
 And she married someone, right? And she had a few marriages in the end. She lost the husband that

362
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:21,280
 she had from the 1936 advertising in 1942 when he accidentally shot himself and... Allegedly.

363
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:26,880
 Allegedly. Yeah. He was dressed as a Cougar at the time though, wasn't he? He was, yeah.

364
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:32,720
 There were suspicions. Yeah. And so then she re-advertises as Andy says with the exact same

365
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:38,320
 wording. Copy and paste for a new husband. Yeah. So good. Well, when you've worked on the wording,

366
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:43,360
 it's clearly done the job once. Use it again. Did it work? Hard to say because he wasn't did

367
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:47,600
 a young man 12 years younger, was it? The last one, yeah. The fourth one. The fourth husband,

368
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:54,000
 but he was also not very nice. So I think he was a drunk and he stole from her. And then

369
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,920
 eventually, and you probably read more about this, apparently he attempted to run Andy off a cliff

370
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:01,920
 in order to take over her farm and she chased him away with her shotgun.

371
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:06,000
 She did. That's what happened. And he never came back. And then she lived on in the homestead into

372
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:11,280
 her 90s and carried on kind of working on there, living off the land, kind of selling bits and

373
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:18,240
 pieces. She also set up a post office in the area. There was no one else there. And so basically,

374
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:23,760
 she would be able to get all these stamps in and then she used the stamps to pay her bills. It was

375
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:29,360
 like a bit of a scam. But yeah. And by the way, a lot of this time when she was clearing the land

376
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:35,440
 and trying to get rid of these wild animals, she was pregnant. So between 1915 and 1931,

377
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:40,720
 which was when she did most of the work, she gave birth to at least 11 children. So I'm just saying

378
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:48,960
 at a nine months off. But maternity leave conditions weren't as beneficial in those days.

379
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:54,400
 You know, if she'd got full salary for a few months, then how many bears have you killed during the

380
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:59,120
 you know, she does sound remarkable. There were a lot of sort of they've paid a lot of

381
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:02,960
 bounties, didn't they for killing cougars back in the day? They did. You know, they were trying to

382
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:08,480
 sort of, you know, tame the frontiers effectively. And so there were like 200 profession professionals

383
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:14,400
 in the USA in 1930. And loads more like those were the federal ones and loads of other state ones.

384
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:20,320
 People like Cougar Smith, or Ben Lilly, who hunted cougars with a knife, which I respect a bit more.

385
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:25,360
 Okay. As in I think, you know, that's giving the cougar a fighting chance. Yeah, it's not as

386
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:31,520
 efficient, is it? It's like if I did this podcast every week, but I decided to find all my facts

387
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:37,600
 from the local library only using books between 1812 and 1829. It's like, how interesting that

388
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:41,840
 you do that. You're not nearly as good at the job. I'm pretty sure you've just described that Andy

389
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:48,320
 finds fags. Dan, can you not spoiler my fact about the Prince Regent today?

390
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:56,640
 On one occasion, Annie heard her dogs barking outside. It was the middle of the night. Obviously,

391
00:37:56,640 --> 00:38:00,160
 she's in the middle of nowhere. So there's no street lights or anything like that. She went

392
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:06,560
 outside. She could hear a commotion. She got her gun to shot into the darkness and then went back

393
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:13,280
 to bed. And then when she woke up, she saw that she had actually got a cougar with her gun shot.

394
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:19,280
 It's very impressive. Wow. That's amazing. Canada was wall-to-wall cougars at the time.

395
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:24,880
 It's less impressive than it sounds. You couldn't miss. So she's not the origin of the word cougar,

396
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:29,440
 to mean a woman who goes out the younger bed. No, that came well after she died. Yeah, that was

397
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:34,240
 sort of 19. They think it might have been 1999, which seems quite early. There was a website called

398
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:40,960
 CougarDate.com, which was specifically for women of a certain age, looking for men of a younger

399
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:44,880
 age. That was the idea. I mean, it's definitely that. There are some etymologies lost in the

400
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:49,360
 midst of time, but we don't know this all. But I think we can say for sure. I must say I actually

401
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:54,000
 read some articles of the people who set up CougarDate.com and they said that they'd heard the

402
00:38:54,000 --> 00:39:00,080
 name mentioned through their friends earlier, sometime in the 1990s in Vancouver. But it was

403
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:06,160
 Vancouver, which is where Cougar Annie was from. Cougars themselves are not cougars.

404
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:14,480
 So actual cougars, the cats I'm talking about, females reach maturity at two and a half years of

405
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:21,040
 age and males at three. So do you see what I mean? Yeah, they don't go for younger males.

406
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:25,520
 Do you know what? I was so glad just because it confirmed something that we've always kind of

407
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:29,840
 thought. You know how cougars have all these different names and you're never sure what

408
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:35,760
 it is. You're like a puma, a panther, a mountain lion, a catamount. What the hell is going on?

409
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:39,520
 What are all these cats? And they're all the same thing. And it does have the Guinness

410
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:45,520
 World Record for the most names for a mammal. Yeah. So there you go. And that's 40 according to them.

411
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:52,880
 Surely the humans have more than 40 names. I'm sorry. No. Cool dude. Awesome. No, I mean actual

412
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:58,960
 names like Jeff and David. Humans have more than 40 of those. If I was given enough time,

413
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:02,960
 I could think of more than 40 names. I'm just saying it's the non-human mammal with the most

414
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:06,880
 names. No, no, no, it's not because they also have their own names. You understand there's a

415
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:12,080
 different meaning to the word name, right? Some cougars are called Jeff. She's back by me.

416
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:15,760
 Some cougars are called Jeff.

417
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:22,000
 No, the names are incredible. Like I'd never heard the name catamount, which means cat of the

418
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:27,120
 mountain. But they also get called the deer tiger, the purple feather. I'm not sure how many people

419
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:30,080
 are using purple feather these days. Is that really one? The purple feather? That's what mountain

420
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:35,280
 screamer would try to love. You wouldn't call an ambulance when you say there's a purple feather

421
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:39,920
 coming at me. It's a purple feather. It feels like you'd use one of the other ones. Do you know

422
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:44,800
 how you defend yourself against a cougar? We should say because it's useful. I would run. I would try

423
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:50,560
 and run. Don't run. Oh, you're dead. Okay. No, you're dead. Dan and Anna have got a guess. What?

424
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:55,520
 Can I have another guess? Yeah, give James a quick guess. Let's say you've magically been resuscitated.

425
00:40:56,160 --> 00:41:02,480
 Play dead. Play dead? Yeah. You're dead again. What? Sorry. If you play dead. Well, so I can't run

426
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:07,040
 and I can't just stay there playing dead. No, that's right. Shotgun. Shotgun. That's the

427
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:14,480
 Cougar Anna. Basically, don't turn around and don't look away. Make yourself big. Oh, the ace of

428
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:19,680
 base defence. Stand your ground. You know, like stand on a rock, bear your teeth, shout anything

429
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:23,520
 to frighten it and scare it away. Basically, and I've thought of a mnemonic for this, which I think

430
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:28,320
 might be helpful for listeners. So just remember, if it's a mountain lion, don't be lion down.

431
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:32,800
 And that's the useful like, what if it's an actual lion? I don't know.

432
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:39,600
 I don't know. I thought you were going to say opera singing, sing opera at it.

433
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:44,880
 Yeah, because that's not on my list. There was a case of a woman who was being stalked by a cougar

434
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:48,800
 and she started hiding and she didn't know what to do. And she just got up and started just singing

435
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:56,080
 opera and the cougar just went, whoa, I'm with the cougar there. Actually, cougars really hate

436
00:41:56,080 --> 00:42:02,960
 podcasts. Really? Yeah, this was this is quite a recent study done in California, which ones name

437
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:10,960
 and shape. Yeah, is it off menu? Come on. Do you mean it makes them angry or they just they don't

438
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:17,760
 want to be around it? No, it puts them off the dinner. So let's say you're a cougar and off menu

439
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:24,000
 comes on. Yeah. And he's like, James A. Castor, he's talking about his food and stuff. And they

440
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:28,800
 would just look at their kill, their deer that they killed and just go, Oh, I don't really fancy

441
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:34,080
 that anymore. In actual fact, the study is to check how they react to humans more generally.

442
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:39,600
 Mostly men. Yeah. Mostly men. You're saying it's not a study about whether there's an untapped podcast

443
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:47,680
 market out there. You astonished me. They wanted to see how they reacted to humans talking if humans

444
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:52,800
 are nearby. And what better way to do that than talk radio podcast, that kind of thing. So they

445
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:59,600
 played some chatting humans, and they just left their food alone and just went off. And the problem

446
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:04,960
 with this, this is really important. So if you are a cougar and you kill something and you don't

447
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:09,840
 eat it, then that means you have to kill something else because you have to eat that. Right. And so

448
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:15,440
 this is the fact that fear really changes ecosystems. If an animal is really scared because

449
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:21,040
 there's humans around, it actually affects the ecosystem in ways you don't expect as in loads

450
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:26,400
 of the prey will get killed. It's not just that the cougar itself is scared. Wait, sorry, the prey

451
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:29,840
 will get killed because the cougar has to go and find something else. Yeah, because it gets put off

452
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:34,080
 its food. So it needs to go and find something else. And then another podcast comes along, maybe

453
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:38,080
 Chris and Rosie Rams, you start chatting to it. And then it has to go and kill another animal.

454
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:45,440
 Nightmare. We're putting nature off its food. Yeah. If I'm ever attacked and just go hello and

455
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:52,560
 welcome to another episode of. Can I tell you another record that Cougars have got? Oh, yeah.

456
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:55,600
 This is another Guinness World Record that Cougars have got. I'm going to quite directly. Mountain

457
00:43:55,600 --> 00:44:00,640
 Lions, large hind legs have greater muscle mass than their front legs. This enables them to jump

458
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:07,520
 up to 18 feet into a tree. So they could they could leap over the statue of David. Yes. Yes.

459
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:12,560
 The highest jump on record for any mammal, any mammal, they could just jump over and lick off

460
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:20,400
 that beeswax. It was recorded for a Puma or a mountain lion, which jumped seven meters, 23 feet,

461
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:27,280
 straight up from a standstill. They could jump into the top of an open top bus if they were walking

462
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:32,400
 alongside it. This is so amazing. Like I read another claim made by the US wildlife authorities,

463
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:39,280
 they could jump over a school bus the long way round, like front to back. Wow. So what's the

464
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:48,080
 distance they can get? Long. I've just named a load of statistics. It's 40 feet. Okay. 17 feet

465
00:44:48,080 --> 00:44:53,680
 by long is what we're saying. Can I just ask a quick question? Yeah. Because this bothers me

466
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:59,200
 about these kind of stats. What is the difference in length between a school bus and a bus? I wonder

467
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:04,160
 if it's slightly an evil, carnival thing, because a lot of stunts were about leaping over back to

468
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:08,880
 back. Yeah. Transport. No, but they never said school buses. They just said buses for evil,

469
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:13,040
 carnival, because they weren't afraid that evil carnival was going to eat their children inside

470
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:18,480
 the bus. Whereas they always say school buses. If it's a slightly threatening animal, because it's

471
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:23,440
 like it will leap over it and then come in the front door, buy its ticket and eat your kids.

472
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:29,920
 You don't have to buy tickets for a school bus. Yeah. Well, it's just all the faster to get on

473
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:35,520
 with eating your children, my dear. Yeah. But they also save human lives, cougars, more human lives

474
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:41,680
 than they end. Probably because they don't really kill, they don't kill many people at all. Very,

475
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:48,160
 very rare to get attacked by a cougar. But what they do prey on a lot is deer. And deer cause 1.2

476
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:54,560
 million car crashes in America a year and killed 200 people. And they did a study which looked at

477
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:59,280
 if you were introduced cougars, how many people they'd save. And because they've eaten all the deer

478
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:04,880
 which are hitting the cars. Exactly. It's a tough sell, though, isn't it? Yeah. When you've got this

479
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:10,480
 animal that could jump over my school bus, come in, buy a ticket and kill all my kids. Are you

480
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:20,880
 like, yeah, but he's going to eat a few deer. Yeah, it is. All right, I need to move us on to our

481
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:26,720
 final fact of the show. Time for a final fact of the show. And that is Andy. My fact is that nobody

482
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:31,920
 knows how large the world's largest crocodile is. What they should do is get a cougar to jump over

483
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:40,480
 it. And all right, here's Cassius. So on the screen is a very large crocodile. He's called

484
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:46,800
 Cassius. He's the largest known crocodile, because he's the largest crocodile in captivity. He is

485
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:53,280
 approximately approximately 18 feet. Which means if you stood him upright.

486
00:46:55,600 --> 00:47:02,720
 That is amazing. I want to see that show where you've got one cougar, one statue of David,

487
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:08,080
 and one enormous crocodile. God, I didn't notice that until now now.

488
00:47:08,080 --> 00:47:14,000
 Channel five, if you're listening, this is big buzz. Yeah. And this is the thing, like, he's been

489
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:18,240
 estimated that they're not sure exactly how old he is, his keepers, because they they took him in

490
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:25,520
 about 40 years ago, 35. And they believe he might be 80. Some keepers think he might be up to 120

491
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:34,320
 years old. Yeah, old crocodile. And he was last measured in 2011 at 18 feet. But even then when

492
00:47:34,320 --> 00:47:38,800
 they took him in, he was missing bits of his snout and his tail, because of fights or accidents or

493
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:43,600
 whatever. And no one has tried to measure him since then. And he's probably grown, but just,

494
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:47,920
 you know, because I think they grow their whole lives that they crocodile. So that he's probably

495
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:53,520
 grown, but they really don't want the like the admin of measuring. He's really terrifying. He's

496
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:58,240
 so huge. And he is terrifying. I mean, what I was thinking, what you don't want to hear about a

497
00:47:58,240 --> 00:48:04,480
 crocodile is how his carer describes him, the guy who looks after him, who's a guy called 2D Scott,

498
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:12,240
 which is a funny name. And 2D says he still has a lot of spark in him, which is not what you want

499
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:16,880
 at all. He says, because most crocodiles are quite disinterested, you know, they just sit there

500
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:22,320
 like a motionless lump. But this one, when you walk in, Cassius, he every time he sees you, he

501
00:48:22,320 --> 00:48:29,600
 wants to come up and say good day in his eyes. His eyes light up tragically 2D Scott was actually

502
00:48:29,600 --> 00:48:36,800
 called 3D Scott until an accident in the pen. He's terrifying. He's met a load of celebrities.

503
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:44,000
 Cassius. Yeah, Queen Elizabeth II. No, Xi Jinping, King of Thailand. They're not so much celebrities

504
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:50,080
 as heads of state. Scott Morrison, who's not a head of state. He's the head of government. Queen

505
00:48:50,080 --> 00:48:56,880
 Elizabeth was the head of state at the time. But nonetheless, God, that seemed so important

506
00:48:56,880 --> 00:49:02,560
 when I said it. And as the words were leaving my mouth, I thought, who gives a toss. Has he met

507
00:49:02,560 --> 00:49:09,840
 Kim Kardashian? No data, don't know. So he hasn't been the longest for that long, has he? The longest

508
00:49:09,840 --> 00:49:16,960
 crocodile? Because there was another crocodile who I think died in 2013, who was called La Long.

509
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:21,920
 Oh, yeah. And so long, they added an extra L and O to the beginning of his name.

510
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:25,520
 They're just so astonished every time they see him, they go, he's long.

511
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:34,400
 Anyway, he was 6.13 meters a little bit longer than Cassius. And he was caught in 2011. I think

512
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:39,120
 these are taken into captivity when they're dangerous. So he'd eaten some fishermen and a

513
00:49:39,120 --> 00:49:48,080
 girl, I think. And so it was a black mark against your name, I think. And so it was hunted. And

514
00:49:48,080 --> 00:49:52,720
 actually, La Long, when he was hunted, it took over 100 people to bring him on to land. He was

515
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:58,560
 really aggressive. He sort of broke his restraining rope twice. And he was named after the crocodile

516
00:49:58,560 --> 00:50:04,720
 hunter in the area, whose nickname was La Long. Oh, okay. La Long died, didn't he? He did. La Long

517
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:08,080
 died. And I imagine for the obituary, they would have gone with so long, la long.

518
00:50:08,080 --> 00:50:20,560
 If you have a baby crying, let's say on a speaker, then a crocodile will run very quickly and

519
00:50:20,560 --> 00:50:29,440
 aggressively towards it. To change it or feed it? I'm afraid not because then they start biting the

520
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:36,880
 speaker. They're really attracted to the sound of primates crying and human babies crying the same

521
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:42,880
 way that bonobos might or chimpanzees might. And probably because they hear a baby crying,

522
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:47,760
 they think this is an easy meal. And what do these crocodiles think of the rest is politics?

523
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:58,000
 Would they engage with it? I read about that study. And the most amazing thing is that they

524
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:03,200
 can tell the difference between how upset a baby is more than you can. And then they'll respond

525
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:08,640
 accordingly. And the way they tested this, which I quite like, is by recording human babies screaming

526
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:15,600
 at different levels of emergency. And you can't torture a baby for science these days. So instead,

527
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:21,520
 what they did was... Anna said with a faint tang of regret in the voice. They recorded babies

528
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:27,120
 at bath time when sometimes they cry. And then when they get vaccinated, when they cry in a bit

529
00:51:27,120 --> 00:51:31,040
 more of an emergency way... A needle, any kind of needle, yeah. Yeah, it's a bit more of someone

530
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:37,520
 stabbing me kind of cry. And the crocodiles swim more vigorously, more fast towards the speakers

531
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:42,480
 that emit the vaccination cry. And they can tell us at a frequency difference that even we can't.

532
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:48,800
 Crocodiles, anti-vaxxers, that's what we're taking from that. I knew I never liked them.

533
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:54,960
 Can I mention very quickly, we're talking about crocodiles. Can't not mention the great Steve Irwin.

534
00:51:56,480 --> 00:52:02,720
 Thank you for the silent respect. Crocodile hunter. Yeah, he was a crocodile hunter. But he

535
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:07,520
 had Australia Zoo, and that was his big thing. He used to jump on a lot of massive crocodiles.

536
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:12,320
 And one of the things which is said about him, and there's a tiny bit of question about it,

537
00:52:12,320 --> 00:52:18,640
 but a lot of people say this is true, is that he had a Galapagos tortoise inside Australia Zoo.

538
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:23,920
 And the previous owner of the tortoise was Charles Darwin. Isn't that insane?

539
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:29,440
 Oh my God, that's so cool. So she was called Harriet. She survived from the time of the Beagle

540
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:34,480
 Expeditions all the way through to Steve Irwin's zoo, just to give you the idea of the span of

541
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:39,760
 time. And it's quite nice because Steve Irwin was definitely a huge hero of mine. There is a

542
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:45,920
 minor planet out in the universe now named for him. So out there somewhere is a minor planet

543
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:55,840
 called Crikey. Something clever that crocodiles do, which is really mean and evil, is they,

544
00:52:55,840 --> 00:53:01,840
 well, I'll tell you what they do and you'll tell me why. They lie underwater and allocators do this

545
00:53:01,840 --> 00:53:06,720
 as well. And they just have a little bit of their head sticking out. And then they put sticks or

546
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:10,640
 branches on their head. What are they doing? They're leering human children who like to

547
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:17,120
 play pickup sticks. You're very close and that could be a secondary purpose. Oh, they're pretending

548
00:53:17,120 --> 00:53:22,560
 to be a bird's nest. So a bird will land on them and delete them. You're basically, between you,

549
00:53:22,560 --> 00:53:34,640
 you're correct. A human baby flies down and picks out one of the sticks and then says Jenga.

550
00:53:36,560 --> 00:53:42,320
 You've gone the wrong way. It's to trick birds into thinking that they're sort of a tree because

551
00:53:42,320 --> 00:53:46,960
 they look quite tree like, don't they? They look like branches and try and go and collect their

552
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:50,160
 sticks to make their nest with. So then the bird will go and land on them to pick up a stick to

553
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:55,840
 make a nest. Snap. You're done. Dinner. Do you know how to measure? This is for alligators. I hope

554
00:53:55,840 --> 00:54:01,040
 I'm allowed a sort of slight curve. How to measure an alligator if you see one in the wild.

555
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:06,400
 So it's possible to measure an alligator in the wild, but it's not possible to measure

556
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:12,240
 this crocodile, which is in captivity. Good point. I suppose if you're in the wild and you see an

557
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:16,000
 alligator and you think, I wonder how big that alligator is. Okay. So you want to see, you don't

558
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:21,040
 want to go up to it with a tape measure. So you see something else around it, which you know,

559
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:25,120
 you throw your iPhone at it. That's it. The iPhone lands on it and you work out how many

560
00:54:25,120 --> 00:54:32,800
 iPhones it is. Exactly. Actually, you have to find an old pair of its shoes in its vest. Crocodile

561
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:41,520
 shoes. That's what the song's about. No, it's so easy. And I just want to get like another little

562
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:46,720
 tip. Yeah, you just approach it at night with a torch and then you locate the midpoint on its

563
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:52,800
 skull and you estimate the distance to the end of the nostrils. Don't wake it up. And then every

564
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:59,360
 inch of that distance is a foot of the alligator. Okay. So like if that distance is six inches,

565
00:54:59,360 --> 00:55:03,520
 you've got a six foot alligator and so on. Okay, that's clever. Crocodiles do a crazy thing where

566
00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:09,440
 they, you would think in any scenario where they live, they're like the dominant species, right?

567
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:15,600
 And they're not. Often hippos, if they're around, are much bigger. So talking earlier about

568
00:55:15,600 --> 00:55:20,480
 crocodiles running to a baby monitor and hearing baby crying, one thing that hippos tend to use

569
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:26,800
 them as is basically like a baby chewing toy. They'll go up and while the croc is just laying there,

570
00:55:26,800 --> 00:55:30,720
 they'll go and they'll start licking it, they'll start chewing it and the crocodile will just lay

571
00:55:30,720 --> 00:55:36,320
 there as if nothing's going on. Yeah, because if it makes any movement, it might antagonize the

572
00:55:36,320 --> 00:55:41,600
 hippo into eating it. So it just has to sit there and be. Is this a baby hippo though that's chewing

573
00:55:41,600 --> 00:55:46,880
 on it? Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's just, you just, it has to lay there and just be sucked on, licked on,

574
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:52,160
 just take it. Well, not everyone has a Henry Hoovey, you know. We've all got one somehow.

575
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:57,440
 I need to wrap us up very soon. Oh, just some things on big animals. Okay, yeah.

576
00:55:57,440 --> 00:56:03,200
 Seeing as that's what this was about. I was looking at big, small animals. So the largest ant,

577
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:09,120
 the largest ant in the world is the safari ant, which is five centimeters in length,

578
00:56:09,120 --> 00:56:13,360
 which is the same length as David's penis if he was human sized.

579
00:56:13,360 --> 00:56:18,720
 If he was human sized, okay. So if you can imagine a human with the world's largest ant,

580
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:24,720
 where your penis would be. Yeah. Yes. That's David. That's really helpful. Thank you, James.

581
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:31,920
 The world's longest insect in total is a stick insect. They found one in China,

582
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:39,280
 which was 24.6 inches in total length, which means that you couldn't legally use her as a rounder's

583
00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:48,480
 bat. So good. Anything else before we, Anna, you all again? I've just, all I can think about now

584
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:52,640
 is giant house spiders, because I've had a real problem with spiders lately. So we've been talking

585
00:56:52,640 --> 00:57:00,800
 about big animals, but they are the biggest. And genuinely, there was one in my room the other day,

586
00:57:00,800 --> 00:57:05,200
 and after an hour and a half of staring at it, I was on my own and eventually managing to kill it

587
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:10,000
 with the longest object I could find, me at one end, it at the other. And they don't die, obviously,

588
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:15,040
 so that its legs are so wriggling. They don't die. They die. They can't. It's not possible to kill them.

589
00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:23,040
 They don't die. And it was two in the morning. I was on my own. This newborn baby was next door.

590
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:28,720
 My newborn baby was next door and asleep. And you know how like the worst thing that can possibly

591
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:35,600
 happen if you have a baby is that it wakes up and then it's legs. There were three legs still

592
00:57:35,600 --> 00:57:40,800
 moving over the thing that I crushed it with. And I screamed at the top of my lungs, no, no, no,

593
00:57:40,800 --> 00:57:48,960
 you can't be alive. You can't be alive. Please die. And anyway, so I looked up how to deter

594
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:54,880
 spiders and you can draw lines of chalk everywhere. So apparently they don't like the taste of chalk

595
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:59,280
 and they taste with their legs. Like it's all over there. I thought you meant like drawing an outline,

596
00:57:59,280 --> 00:58:04,160
 like emergency. Yeah, yeah. Whoa, this person kills spiders. Let's get out of here, man.

597
00:58:04,160 --> 00:58:16,960
 Okay, that is it. That is all of our facts. Thank you so much for listening to our 500th episode,

598
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:24,720
 everybody. We can all be found on our Twitter accounts. I'm on at Shriverland James.

599
00:58:24,720 --> 00:58:33,760
 James Harkin, Andy, and Anna. I'm uncontactable. Oh, sorry. Yeah, podcast.qi.com and Andy will

600
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:38,800
 pick it up and he'll text me and I'll ignore it. Yeah, we can get us on a group account at no such

601
00:58:38,800 --> 00:58:42,560
 thing. You can also find our website, no such thing as a fish.com where all of our previous
