00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:18,000
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming to you from the QI offices in Covern garden. My name is Dan Schreiber.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
 I'm sitting here with James Harkin, Annotch Zinski, and Andy Murray.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:31,000
 Once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite thanks from the last seven days, and in no particular order, here we go. Starting with you, James.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
 Okay, my fact this week is that bananas emit antimatter.

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
 That's not, so I've had to get my head round antimatter, which...

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
 I just was such bananas.

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
 I should have gone down that bridge.

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 What am I doing?

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:54,000
 So, antimatter is just like the opposite of matter, so if you have an electron with a negative charge, then the antimatter version of that is a positive charge.

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
 I see what's weird is I just, for me, I still don't understand what that means.

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 It means that when you say you have to get your head round it, if you'd actually have to put your head round antimatter, your head would no longer exist.

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
 Wait, antimatter.

18
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
 That was just some kind of Freudian slip.

19
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
 The presence of Andy in a room eliminates everything else.

20
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:20,000
 So, wait, because what I read was the beginning of the universe, big explosion, and what should have happened is the universe created enough matter, which is why we're here.

21
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:27,000
 But it also should have created an equal amount of antimatter, which in theory should have wiped out the matter, and we shouldn't be here at all.

22
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:34,000
 Because if you get to a matter particle and an antimatter particle and they come together, they just explode into energy.

23
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
 Put my hand up, I've still don't fully understand it.

24
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:46,000
 Well, that's why you research bananas, I guess. So, quick question about the bananas. If banana emits antimatter, but it is matter, why doesn't it cancel itself out?

25
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
 It doesn't matter. It's a very good answer.

26
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
 Yeah, it's a very good, it's a very satisfying answer, though.

27
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:58,000
 So, what happens is bananas contain potassium, and some of the potassium decays, because it's slightly radioactive.

28
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
 I think you might have already known that bananas are radioactive.

29
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:09,000
 And what it does is it, when it decays, it emits a positron and turns into argon from potassium.

30
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
 And a positron is an antimatter particle.

31
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:18,000
 It is, and then the positron will then meet an electron, and then we'll just turn into a little bit of energy.

32
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
 So, there's a tiny reaction happening in a banana.

33
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
 It will be on the outside of banana, yeah.

34
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
 It's about every 75 minutes, I believe.

35
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:30,000
 I read that with humans that we're trying to create antimatter, we've got a tiny amount.

36
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,000
 But if we created a lot, it would be equivalent of an atomic bomb explosion.

37
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
 Yeah, I mean, it's a bit much bigger.

38
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:44,000
 So, if we created a giant banana, not only would it explode, but it would have the radioactive fallout as well.

39
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
 Well, there is someone on the wire who has worked this out.

40
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:54,000
 And they said to turn bananas into a power station by utilizing this fact that they create positrons.

41
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:01,000
 To get 200 watts, you would need a banana generator with 2.2 times 10 to the 20 bananas.

42
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
 That's right.

43
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,000
 And it would be a sphere full of bananas, 200 kilometers in radius.

44
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
 And that would create 200 watts.

45
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:15,000
 So, we don't think big supermarket should be on the lookout for someone ordering a suspicious number of bananas.

46
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:21,000
 There isn't a button for times 10 to the automatic check out, sister.

47
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,000
 Do you guys know when bananas reach the UK?

48
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
 Because they think it dates to the mid-15th century.

49
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
 Really?

50
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
 They found a banana peel in a Tudor rubbish tip.

51
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
 And the first, you know, the first...

52
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
 Well, they're doing like a Charlie Chaplin style comedy sketch.

53
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
 Who knows?

54
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
 We have no idea how it got there.

55
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
 And it's really freaked everyone out.

56
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
 Because previously, archaeologists and historians thought that they got to England in the 19th century.

57
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:51,000
 But there's a theory. This is just a theory that they were really common in to drink them.

58
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
 But obviously, by the time they got here, they'd all be completely black and unrecognizable as bananas.

59
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
 And therefore, that's why we have no depictions of bananas.

60
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
 You just picture him with the eighth eating a banana. It's so weird.

61
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
 That's kind of dirty, actually.

62
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
 Image.

63
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
 Doesn't it?

64
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
 So, I don't like it.

65
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
 I read in the QI archives.

66
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
 A Victorian guy called Lord Egremont.

67
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
 Do you know this fact?

68
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
 No.

69
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:23,000
 Okay, so Lord Egremont, he spent Â£3,000 building a greenhouse where he kept a single banana tree.

70
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
 Because he wanted to grow his own bananas.

71
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
 And so, he managed to grow them.

72
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
 And the day came, where he was having his first taste of it,

73
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,000
 at which he exclaimed, "Oh, God, it tastes just like every other damn banana."

74
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,000
 I'd had the tree immediately destroyed.

75
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,000
 Have you heard the story of Auburn War and the bananas?

76
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
 This is so good.

77
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:49,000
 So, the banana impulse were banned between 1940 and 1945.

78
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,000
 And soon after that, the first delivery arrived since the ban,

79
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
 which was 10 million bananas.

80
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
 And the new Labour government said, "Let's have a national banana day,

81
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
 where every child should have a banana."

82
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
 Right.

83
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
 Auburn War was a writer. He was the son of Evelyn War.

84
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
 And as a child, he and his two sisters, they got three bananas.

85
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
 And they had heard all about bananas. They were so excited.

86
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
 And he wrote, later on in his memoirs,

87
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
 "They were put on my father's plate,

88
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
 and before the anguished eyes of his children, he poured on cream,

89
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,000
 which was almost unprocurable, and sugar, which was heavily rationed,

90
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
 and ate all three."

91
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
 From that moment, I never treated anything he had to say on faith

92
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
 or morals very seriously.

93
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
 It's incredible.

94
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
 Have you heard of banana peelers?

95
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
 Oh, I don't think so.

96
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
 These are such interesting people.

97
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
 They were fraudsters in the late 19th century,

98
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
 and they made their living from, it was on railways they were.

99
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
 They would take an old banana peel out of their pocket,

100
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,000
 put it on the ground, slip over on it, and sue the railway for compensation.

101
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
 One woman called Banana Anna.

102
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
 She did that 17 times over the course of her career.

103
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
 She got huge compensation for it.

104
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
 It's weird she called herself Banana Anna when she could just be called Banana.

105
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
 You would have thought, wouldn't you?

106
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
 You thought this already, aren't you?

107
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
 There was this, relatedly, to banana slipping.

108
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,000
 In 1941 in Texas, first one in the newspaper article where I read this,

109
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,000
 there was a ship that was described as the first ocean-going cargo ship

110
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
 built since the World War.

111
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:21,000
 This is in 1941, so Parold America had quite predicted what was happening around them,

112
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
 and then the other World War.

113
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
 Anyway, the newspaper reported that the first ocean-going cargo ship

114
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,000
 built since the World War was launched on a bed of half a ton of bananas,

115
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
 because it was cheaper than Greece, apparently.

116
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:37,000
 So the bed, it slid into the water on half a ton of bananas.

117
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:42,000
 In 1923, the song "Yes, We Have No Bananas" was released.

118
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,000
 It was a massive hit, it sold 25,000 copies a day.

119
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:51,000
 But this was in sheet music, because they didn't have the recordings back then.

120
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,000
 And it was so popular, it spurred a new craze, dancing the Charleston

121
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
 on Banana Peel-Covid Flos.

122
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
 That sounds great, doesn't it?

123
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
 Do you know who wrote that?

124
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
 It was Leon Trotsky's nephew.

125
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:09,000
 He followed a very different career path to his uncle.

126
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
 Well, here's a slightly weird link.

127
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
 The bananas in pajamas, the TV show.

128
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
 Yeah, Australian big TV show.

129
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
 It was big here, right?

130
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
 Karl Marx's grandson, I believe, played the banana.

131
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
 Yeah.

132
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
 So it started off as a song.

133
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
 It was called "Bananas in Pajamas," and that's what the whole series was based on.

134
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:32,000
 The song was written by Carrie Blighten, who was the nephew of ENID Blighten.

135
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
 Hey.

136
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
 Oh.

137
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
 So two nephews involved in songs.

138
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
 There we go.

139
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
 That's our bananas.

140
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
 About bananas.

141
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,000
 So when I started researching this fact on bananas, I thought I hit a jackpot moment

142
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:48,000
 because I discovered on Twitter that was an account called "at true banana facts."

143
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
 Oh, yeah.

144
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
 Unfortunately, really disappointing.

145
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
 Let me give you a few examples of the facts.

146
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
 Bananas are actually very bad and not good.

147
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
 Just kidding.

148
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
 Bananas are yellow and healthy.

149
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
 420 retweets.

150
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
 They have me for a second there, actually.

151
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
 Yeah.

152
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
 Don't like what someone is saying.

153
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
 Pop a nice banana in their mouth and shut them up.

154
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
 1,628 retweets.

155
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
 All right.

156
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
 What's your problem then?

157
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
 These are true.

158
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
 They are facts, and they are about bananas.

159
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
 Bananas are not good at soccer, because they don't really have legs.

160
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
 Really.

161
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
 They don't really have legs.

162
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
 They've sort of got legs.

163
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,000
 You mentioned that bananas are yellow, but...

164
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
 Yeah.

165
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,000
 And I think they're healthy and good for you, are they?

166
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
 Not entirely true.

167
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:38,000
 They are not yellow if you see in the UV spectrum.

168
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:43,000
 I don't think they'll hold up anymore.

169
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
 So, yeah, they've recently discovered this.

170
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,000
 Only recently discovered that if you shine a black light on a yellow banana,

171
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,000
 it glows blue, which other plants don't do, and they don't know why.

172
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
 But they think it might be to help things like fruit bats,

173
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
 which prey on bananas, they do see in the UV spectrum.

174
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
 And so that makes the bananas show up more than that.

175
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
 Do you say they prey on bananas?

176
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,000
 With those little legs, they'll be able to walk faster than anything.

177
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,000
 Actually, they don't really have legs.

178
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
 I read a thing psychologically that if you've shown a black and white photo of a banana,

179
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
 you see yellow.

180
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
 Your brain just projects yellow onto it.

181
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:25,000
 With tingees of yellow, you're brain just naturally finds little tingees of it.

182
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
 That is really interesting.

183
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
 So, bananas are slightly radioactive.

184
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:35,000
 I read that eating 600 bananas is the equivalent of having a single chest x-ray.

185
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
 I just like that you're presented with that option in hospital.

186
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
 How many bananas was it?

187
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
 600.

188
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
 Well, we can x-ray the foot, of course.

189
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
 Or, you could just eat these bananas.

190
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
 I'm going to give you 600 bananas.

191
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:51,000
 The nurse now is going to stand behind the screen.

192
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
 That would kill you.

193
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
 There's too much potassium.

194
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
 What's too much of eating?

195
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
 Generally.

196
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
 Depends on the time span.

197
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
 I mean, you've read over a lifetime.

198
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,000
 But that's a long wait for your chest x-ray.

199
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
 There was a guy in a hospital.

200
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,000
 He'd stolen the necklace and he ate the necklace.

201
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
 And they wanted to get it back off him.

202
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:19,000
 And so, to get it back, they needed him to pass the stool.

203
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
 And in order to do that, they fed him bananas.

204
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
 But then it came in the news, and some doctors said this is stupid,

205
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
 because bananas do not really work as laxatives.

206
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:32,000
 And the only thing bananas will do is add bulk to his stool.

207
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,000
 Maybe that was a way of protecting the necklace, though, or the bones.

208
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
 I'm like, bubble wrapping the goods.

209
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
 I read that they fed him 60 bananas.

210
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
 Yeah. And the article just finished by saying,

211
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
 "Meanwhile, the owner of the necklace has said she will not wear it again."

212
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:55,000
 Okay. Time for fact number two.

213
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
 And that is Shazinski.

214
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:02,000
 My fact this week is that Slovenia's largest lake, Glakesurk Nica,

215
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
 disappears every year.

216
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
 Where does it go?

217
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
 So it's a lake called Lake Kirknicca.

218
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,000
 And when it exists, it has a service area of 30 kilometres squared.

219
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
 So it's not volume at service area.

220
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
 It makes it the biggest lake in Slovenia.

221
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
 So there are two terms here, Polje, which is a field above a cast.

222
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,000
 And a cast is basically a landscape that's got loads of kind of soft rock in it.

223
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
 And it means that water's eroded the soft rock in various places

224
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
 and created holes in it like a Swiss cheese.

225
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,000
 And it basically means that the lake gets filled up in rainy season.

226
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
 And then it gets sucked through these swallow holes,

227
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
 or these sink holes, when it gets dry and the water stops coming through.

228
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
 And it vanishes.

229
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
 So it'll be a lake one day and there's both on it.

230
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
 But most of you are camping in this nice big field.

231
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
 Yeah.

232
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
 And then you just wake up suddenly you're in the middle of a lake.

233
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
 Yup. Be like Glastonbury.

234
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
 How long does it disappear for?

235
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
 So it generally disappears between I think June and September.

236
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
 It's amazing that this is the biggest lake in Slovenia.

237
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
 Yeah.

238
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
 It is a natural wonder.

239
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
 It disappears every year, but we still haven't heard of it.

240
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
 I find it as truly bizarre.

241
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
 So you just went.

242
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
 You just got back from Slovenia.

243
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
 I just got back from Slovenia.

244
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
 Did you go and visit this lake?

245
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
 I didn't.

246
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
 How bad is that?

247
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
 Well, maybe you didn't.

248
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
 It wasn't there.

249
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
 Anyway.

250
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
 Do you guys, did you happen to hear about while you were there,

251
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
 the religion, the fifth biggest religion of Slovenia?

252
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
 Oh, yes.

253
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
 I love this.

254
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
 I can't even hear this.

255
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:26,000
 Okay, so the fifth biggest religion in Slovenia is called the trans-universal zombie church of blissful ringing.

256
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,000
 And it's, yeah, it's become the fifth biggest religion in less than a year.

257
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
 And what do they do?

258
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
 They bring bells.

259
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
 Yeah, they bring bells.

260
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
 They eat brains.

261
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:39,000
 They have a holy book which says so it's rules written down.

262
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:43,000
 It's holy book include the fact that it zombies resurrect daily.

263
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
 It's holy drinks of beer and peanut colladas.

264
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
 And holy peanut colladas.

265
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
 Holy peanut colladas.

266
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:55,000
 And it worships cows and it recommends eating the super succulent Japanese Kobe beef.

267
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
 And also I like this.

268
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:02,000
 They're sermons instead of ending with an arm end and with bong.

269
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
 I think it's cool.

270
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
 Wow.

271
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
 But it's actually, I mean, it's actually really good.

272
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
 So it's an anti-corruption party.

273
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000
 And it was set up as a serious opposition to rampant corruption in Slovenia.

274
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
 Wow.

275
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,000
 And it was cooled by the Prime Minister of Slovenia, I think.

276
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
 It was referred to as a bunch of zombies.

277
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
 And so they embraced the zombie tag.

278
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
 So it's very cool.

279
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
 Yeah.

280
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
 Good guys.

281
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
 You were talking about holy peanut collada.

282
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:25,000
 Here's another Slovenian drink, a salamander brandy.

283
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
 You tried that when you were in Slovenia?

284
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:31,000
 Well, I'm glad you didn't try it because it's not a very nice way of making it.

285
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:36,000
 They take a salamander, hang it by its back legs and pour brandy over its body.

286
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
 And so it drips into a cup and then you drink it.

287
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:44,000
 And the idea is you infuse the alcohol with the poison that the salamander makes on its back.

288
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:49,000
 And the slight bit of poison and the brandy, apparently, gives you more of a kick and not more.

289
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
 Wow.

290
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
 I was looking up oldest things in Slovenia.

291
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
 Slovenia has the oldest wheel ever found.

292
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
 Oh, really?

293
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
 Oldest wheel.

294
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
 And it was found in, and I can't pronounce it.

295
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
 But Lijabjana, Ljubljana.

296
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
 Yep.

297
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
 And dance was right, actually.

298
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
 Lijabjana, marshes.

299
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
 Oh, also they have, you about to say this.

300
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
 They have the oldest vine.

301
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
 It's a great vine.

302
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
 It still bears grapes.

303
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
 It's over 400 years old.

304
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
 The Guinness World Records book went over there, put it in their book.

305
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
 So the camera said we'll put it in their book.

306
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
 And you know what it's called?

307
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
 No.

308
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
 It's called Old Vine.

309
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:27,000
 So they also like the linden tree, which is that tree that kind of smells of semen.

310
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
 Wait, sorry.

311
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
 Can we just spoken about this?

312
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
 No, but...

313
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
 What knows about the linden tree?

314
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
 It smells like semen.

315
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
 There's a famous Michelin web sketch.

316
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
 Anyway, the linden tree smells of semen.

317
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
 Right.

318
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
 They're proud of their linden trees.

319
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,000
 And there's a 780 year old linden tree in Slovenia, which is the oldest one.

320
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,000
 And every year in the summer, the government has a political meeting underneath it.

321
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
 Does it smell like very, very old semen?

322
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
 Yes.

323
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
 A long abandoned condom.

324
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,000
 Oh, the government gathers around.

325
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
 Does anyone got anything else?

326
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
 Something Slovenia also has.

327
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
 Yeah.

328
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
 The Hitler Beetle.

329
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
 Oh, yeah.

330
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
 If you haven't...

331
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
 Oh, yes, yeah.

332
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
 And I think...

333
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,000
 I don't think in my head I thought you meant the beetles as in the band.

334
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
 And I was like, "Who is the Hitler Beetle?"

335
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,000
 I had a John Paul Jordan go over and go.

336
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
 The Hitler Beetle.

337
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
 The Hitler Beetle.

338
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
 The Hitler Beetle.

339
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,000
 The Hitler Beetle.

340
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
 It's a cave beetle.

341
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
 It's blind.

342
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
 And it lives in five caves in Slovenia.

343
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
 It's very, very rare.

344
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
 And it was named in 1933 by someone who really liked Hitler.

345
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
 He was a guy called Oscar Scheibel.

346
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
 And Hitler wrote him a thank you letter.

347
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:36,000
 And they're now critically endangered because Hitler fans are still in the market for them.

348
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
 And they sell Â£4,000 each.

349
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,000
 Well, that's why I went to Slovenia this year.

350
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,000
 Also, just one more thing, just on taxonomy.

351
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:51,000
 I know this is a complete tangent, but there wasn't a fly in 1994, a fossil fly, which was named "I", just the letter "I".

352
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
 I was named that.

353
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:59,000
 Until a researcher said he didn't want to have to keep writing, "I have small male genitalia".

354
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
 He got changed.

355
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,000
 He got changed to "I.I.I".

356
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:11,000
 OK, time for fact number three. And that is Andy.

357
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:16,000
 My fact is that half the world's tigers have died in the last month, and nobody knows why.

358
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
 What is a "siger"?

359
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
 They look like antelopes that are in Star Wars.

360
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
 They look like a Dr. Soos character.

361
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
 Yes, they do.

362
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
 Yeah.

363
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
 Their faces are nice.

364
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,000
 They're notably strange probosis on the front of their face.

365
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:33,000
 And they live in Mongolia and Kazakhstan, I believe, and it's China.

366
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:40,000
 And for some reason, we don't know why, but in the last month, half of all "siger" have died.

367
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
 Wow.

368
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
 I think the dying has stopped now.

369
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
 You mentioned Mongolia and China. I actually think they're extinct there now.

370
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
 Oh really?

371
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:51,000
 And I think they were driven to extinction by the fact that they were being used for medicine.

372
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:55,000
 So you could buy bits of them for quite a lot of money and...

373
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
 Is their horns, isn't it?

374
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:56,000
 Yeah.

375
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
 They put their ground up horns.

376
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
 That's one of the reasons they're so endangered.

377
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
 In the early 90s, I think there were millions of them.

378
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:07,000
 And yeah, they were hunted partly because conservationists were trying to conserve rhinos.

379
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,000
 Because rhinoharm was being used as a traditional medicine.

380
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:15,000
 And so sort of encouraged people to revert to "siger horns" instead of traditional medicine.

381
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
 And it's thought to be like an aphrodisiac.

382
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:21,000
 And so, for instance, in Singapore, you can buy cooling water, which is...

383
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:25,000
 It looks like a normal bottle of water, which says that this can reduce a fever or just really cool you off.

384
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:29,000
 And if you look at the ingredients, it's got "siger horn" as one of the ingredients.

385
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
 It's terrible.

386
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
 Wow, isn't it?

387
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
 They are really delightful creatures.

388
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:38,000
 There's a website "ultimateunculate.com", which has good stuff about them.

389
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:44,000
 And it also says, "Only one word can describe the face of the ciger, bulging."

390
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:49,000
 If you look at them straight on, it looks like their eyes are sticking out on little stalks.

391
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
 They have really, really odd faces.

392
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
 And they're tiny, aren't they? They're about two foot tall, I think.

393
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
 Yeah, they're not very big.

394
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
 They're really small there.

395
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
 But those noses that they have, they're pretty extraordinary.

396
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
 They can heat air in them.

397
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
 In the winter, they do that.

398
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:05,000
 Yeah, so if it's too cold, they'll take air in, and they'll just do a quick sort of microwave on it.

399
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,000
 And they'll take it into their lungs and...

400
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,000
 Did they sound like I'm sucking like a little Jinsters burger at the same time?

401
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
 Quickly!

402
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:18,000
 I was looking up other animals with mental noses, basically, for this.

403
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,000
 I really like the hammerhead bat, which looks just like a moose.

404
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,000
 It's just like a huge nose, and its larynx takes up half of its body.

405
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:31,000
 And the way they attract female mates is by a big honking ceremony.

406
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,000
 So all the bats line up on hang-off various trees.

407
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,000
 And they all perform this honking ceremony through their gigantic larynxes.

408
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
 And then the female bats all fly past and listen.

409
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:43,000
 And if they like the sound of someone's honking, then they pop onto the branch next to him.

410
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
 Oh, so cool.

411
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
 One more thing that cigers do with their trunks.

412
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:52,000
 They use them to lure females, male cigers do.

413
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
 They make sounds through their prebosses.

414
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:58,000
 If they make lower sounds, they can make themselves seem larger than they are.

415
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
 And that's more attractive.

416
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,000
 And this is important for cigers, because most matings occur mainly at nights,

417
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
 when the real sizes of callers are not visible.

418
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:12,000
 So all the female cigers are thinking that there's these really beefy kind of male cigers around.

419
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,000
 And then during the day time, they're like, "Where have they all gone?"

420
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
 It's just this little weedy guy around.

421
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:21,000
 Is it like that thing where you wake up in the morning after one night's stand and go,

422
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
 "Oh."

423
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
 You said you were not what I was expecting.

424
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,000
 You said you were huge.

425
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:31,000
 Probably the most interesting taxonomy thing about antelopes generally.

426
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
 They are even toad ungulates.

427
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
 So that group is called Artio Dactila.

428
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:40,000
 It's recently been discovered that these share a common ancestor with catations, i.e. whales.

429
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
 And they're all part of the same group as catations.

430
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:48,000
 And this is partly why we believe now that whales evolve from being on land to going back in the water,

431
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:54,000
 because there's this tiny two kilogram mouse deer, which really likes being in the water.

432
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
 And so we just...

433
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
 She wants to be a whale.

434
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
 Yeah, she wants to be a whale.

435
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:02,000
 And that's kind of the link between whales now and millions of years ago,

436
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:06,000
 when these little deer kind of evolved to creep back into the water and turn the whales.

437
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
 So you have a little deer?

438
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
 Yeah, a little deer.

439
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
 How big is this?

440
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
 Who wants to be a whale?

441
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,000
 At night time, probably telling the ladies he is a whale.

442
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:19,000
 And it's because we found ankle bones in certain catations, haven't we?

443
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
 Yeah, and also they sometimes grow hips.

444
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,000
 Well, they have hip bones and sometimes grow little legs on the side of whales.

445
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
 They don't really have legs.

446
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
 Not like bananas.

447
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
 I was reading this book.

448
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,000
 It was like a book of biology from 1800.

449
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:37,000
 And apparently to say a woman had eyes like an antelope was the highest praise you could possibly give her.

450
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,000
 Because they have the most beautiful eyes.

451
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,000
 You have eyes like an antelope and nose like a ciger.

452
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,000
 Legs like a whale.

453
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:51,000
 Also on attractive women been compared to antelopes.

454
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
 Yeah.

455
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,000
 The word for an Arabic love poem is a gazelle.

456
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,000
 And that is thought to come be connected to the word gazelle.

457
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:02,000
 Because often women were compared to gazelles in Arabic love poetry.

458
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:11,000
 So for instance, there's one poem I think from the year about 650 AD where the caliph abd al-Malek frees a gazelle he's captured.

459
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
 Because he suddenly realizes it looks like the woman he's in love with.

460
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,000
 So he captures this gazelle and is like, oh my god.

461
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
 On extinctions, just one more thing.

462
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
 The voluntary human extinction movement.

463
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
 Do you know about these guys?

464
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
 No.

465
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
 So there is the V-H-E-M-T.

466
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
 They call themselves vehement.

467
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:33,000
 And their idea is that humans should die out because it would save all the other animals on the planet.

468
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:38,000
 He doesn't think the people who are in charge don't think that everyone should just be killed.

469
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,000
 They think we should just not have children.

470
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
 That's the idea.

471
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:47,000
 And they think that the need for children is cultural conditioning.

472
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,000
 And actually people don't really want to have children.

473
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:56,000
 And they could take such desires and channel them into perhaps gardening or adopting a stream.

474
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
 Adopting a stream.

475
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
 Adopting a stream.

476
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
 That's one of the suggestions.

477
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:03,000
 You'll be really sad if you adopt a lake in Slovenia with you.

478
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:10,000
 Okay, time for a final fact for the show.

479
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
 And that is my fact.

480
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:17,000
 My fact this week is that Barbara Streisand had a shopping mall built for her sole use and it's under her house.

481
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:21,000
 It's got a cobblestone paved street.

482
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,000
 And then it's a collection of just old last century style shops.

483
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
 Sounds like Diagon Alley.

484
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
 It kind of looks like it when you see it.

485
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
 I mean, it's got a sweet shop.

486
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,000
 It has an antique doll shop.

487
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
 Are they all stuffed?

488
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
 No.

489
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
 There's no cash registers.

490
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,000
 What she does is she buys it rather than putting stuff in her actual house.

491
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:42,000
 She's just set up shops underneath her house to put the things that she's bought into.

492
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
 So they're like cupboards really?

493
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
 Yeah.

494
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
 But they're...

495
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
 What are you saying is she's got a massive cupboard.

496
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
 I know it's covered.

497
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,000
 But she now, like she's taken it so seriously that when she's on the sets of movies,

498
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,000
 like famously on Meet the Fockers, the movie that she was in,

499
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:59,000
 when they were dismantling the sets, she started collecting the doors and bringing them back to her.

500
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
 When you say collecting, do you mean stealing?

501
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
 I think she asked.

502
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
 I don't think Barbara Streisand could steal.

503
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,000
 I think she just takes it and you go, "Well, I must have given that said."

504
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
 That kind of thought that gets people in trouble.

505
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:14,000
 So Blasto was just collecting a lot of money.

506
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,000
 Yes, so she has an antique shop.

507
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,000
 She has things like benches out the front from men to sit on.

508
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
 I think she sounds tiresome.

509
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
 I'm sorry, Dan.

510
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
 Yeah, I'm not defending her.

511
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
 I'm just saying this is what she's got.

512
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
 Also, she doesn't know what a shop is.

513
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
 That's not a mall.

514
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:33,000
 You have to have some kind of exchange of money for goods in a mall.

515
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
 Does she walk around it?

516
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
 Yeah, she walks around it.

517
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:41,000
 If she's going to a party and she needs to bring a present, she'll go down into her mall

518
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
 and she'll pick up a knife to get to the center.

519
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
 Does she do all the voices?

520
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
 Does she run around behind the counter?

521
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:50,000
 I'm saying, "Oh, that'll be 86 dollars, Ms. Trison."

522
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
 Well, that's very expensive, but I'm sure.

523
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
 Well, it looks like it's worth the money.

524
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
 Thank you.

525
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
 Would you like it wrapped?

526
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
 Oh, yes, please, I'd love it wrapped.

527
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
 That's an excellent bar of stress and depression.

528
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
 Thank you very much.

529
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:04,000
 So, my favourite thing about bar of stress and is that her real name is Barbara Strison.

530
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,000
 Originally, but she got rid of an A in the name Barbara.

531
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,000
 So, it's now B-A-R-B-R-A.

532
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,000
 I think she said she did that because she wanted to be a bit special.

533
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
 But, like, changing her name fully was too showy.

534
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
 And that seems to be a part of herself.

535
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
 She's left behind.

536
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:23,000
 Do you think she goes to her Starbucks in her mall?

537
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
 Excuse me.

538
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
 What is the name, please?

539
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
 Well, it's Barbara.

540
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
 Okay, is that B-A-R-R-B-A?

541
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
 No, not actually.

542
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:43,000
 In 2006, she donated 11,750,000 dollars to the Barbara Strison Foundation.

543
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:48,000
 Which, I'm sure that that money goes somewhere, but I like that idea.

544
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:52,000
 Because it was the construction of vast underground palaces.

545
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:56,000
 So, the main thing that I know Barbara Strison for is the Barbara Strison effect.

546
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
 Yes, please.

547
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:01,000
 Okay, so this is on the internet, you try and stop people from doing it.

548
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
 And it just makes them want to do it even more.

549
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:07,000
 And it started off when some guy took a photo of her house and she wasn't very happy.

550
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:11,000
 And she tried to sue him to stop people from being able to see it on the internet.

551
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:17,000
 And 420,000 people went to the website to look at this house because of the lawsuit.

552
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:22,000
 And before they'd done the lawsuit, it'd only been downloaded six times.

553
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
 Wow.

554
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:28,000
 So just by starting off the lawsuit, it meant that everyone then saw what she was trying to find.

555
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,000
 Did you also recently do a lawsuit about no one's allowed to release a podcast

556
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:34,000
 referring to my ridiculously extravagant basement?

557
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:40,000
 I'm doing a series of amusing, but also startlingly accurate impressions of me.

558
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:46,000
 Actually, relatedly, I read this most fascinating article in the New Yorker recently.

559
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
 And it's extravagant houses.

560
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:52,000
 The second biggest mansion in London after Buckingham Palace is in Highgate.

561
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
 Nobody knows who owns it.

562
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
 People have been trying to find out for years.

563
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
 And it's this, so it's called Wittenhurst.

564
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
 It also has a ridiculous basement.

565
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:04,000
 So it has a 70 foot long swimming pool in the basement.

566
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:09,000
 A cinema with the Metsanine, massage rooms, a sauna, gym, staff quarters.

567
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
 It's just a normal house.

568
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,000
 It's just a standard basement, more than 40,000 square feet.

569
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:18,000
 And the family's lawyer, the family of the, the owner's it's lawyer,

570
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:22,000
 said that he would take the secret of Wittenhurst ownership to the grave.

571
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,000
 The journalist in New Yorker who went to talk to the estate agent about it,

572
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:28,000
 the estate agent made the journalist leave her phone in her bag in a different room,

573
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,000
 while he just discussed the house with her.

574
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,000
 I mean, it's the only thing bigger than it in London is Buckingham Palace.

575
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
 That's insane.

576
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
 That's incredible.

577
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:42,000
 The idea of digging downwards now to make house extensions is massive.

578
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
 And stuff that they're building is insane.

579
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:49,000
 People are putting in two floor rock climbing walls and Ferrari museums.

580
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:54,000
 And that's what the guy who he hasn't been able to build it just yet.

581
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:59,000
 But the Foxton's owner is trying to get an extension below his garden

582
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:02,000
 where he wants to keep his Ferrari's as a Ferrari museum.

583
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,000
 As a museum, though.

584
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:06,000
 Well, the museum be open to the public.

585
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
 Will it be one of these barris and shopping mall things?

586
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
 Oh, what a lovely Ferrari.

587
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,000
 You enormously wealthy man.

588
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:16,000
 Have you guys read about this guy who posted on Reddit earlier on this year?

589
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,000
 I think he moved into a studio apartment somewhere somewhere in England.

590
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:23,000
 And he found a trap door in the sort of trap door in the floor that hadn't been

591
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:27,000
 the estate agent's hadn't mentioned it, opened it, turns out it's an old English

592
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
 monastery conversion underground.

593
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,000
 So he bought a studio apartment.

594
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,000
 He now has 30 rooms.

595
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
 Fantastic.

596
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,000
 Quite exciting, isn't it?

597
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
 That's great.

598
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:38,000
 I've got to dig up all the flaws in my house just in case there's longer.

599
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,000
 I would do the same thing, but I live on the first floor.

600
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:46,000
 There's a mirror kingdom underneath mine.

601
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,000
 The White House has an amazing bunker.

602
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,000
 And they'll currently build it.

603
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:54,000
 In fact, they're going to be moving Barack Obama and the Oval Office this year

604
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
 away to another location in the White House.

605
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
 Really?

606
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
 Because they now need to add all the extensions.

607
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
 Because he has a trap door underneath the desk.

608
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:05,000
 There's a trap door for the president underneath the desk.

609
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:08,000
 This is what it says, the existing trap door under the president's desk

610
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,000
 leaning down to the secret service command post will be modified.

611
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:15,000
 So this is what's currently going on to allow presidential passage directly

612
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
 to the new underground command bunker.

613
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,000
 Now what's interesting is now this is from this is from the White House's website.

614
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:24,000
 In 2010, they started building a new underground command sensor.

615
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:28,000
 And it was this building that was sitting there that in the Bush administration

616
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,000
 the building officially didn't exist.

617
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:34,000
 Despite being there, they just said, what, what, we don't know what you're talking about.

618
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,000
 It didn't at all as they have a problem with the administration

619
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:40,000
 with whether or not things existed.

620
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:45,000
 Okay, that's it.

621
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,000
 That's all of our facts.

622
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,000
