00:00:00,00:00:06,"They don't look at it, but it won't look at it."
00:00:06,00:00:14,"Hello, and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming"
00:00:14,00:00:17,to you from the QI offices in Covert Garden.
00:00:17,00:00:23,"My name is Dad Shriver, I'm sitting here with Anish Zinski, James Harkin, and Andy Murray,"
00:00:23,00:00:26,and once again we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last
00:00:26,00:00:33,"seven days, and in no particular order, here we go, starting with you Chazinski."
00:00:33,00:00:38,"My fact this week is that the first trampolines were made of wool or skin, and this is a thing"
00:00:38,00:00:42,"that's called blanket tossing, and it's been practiced for the..."
00:00:42,00:00:47,My teenage boys for thousands of years.
00:00:47,00:00:52,"Okay, so blanket tossing is something that's been practiced by the Anupiat Eskimos up in Alaska"
00:00:52,00:00:56,"for, we don't know exactly how long, but references to it go back to..."
00:00:56,00:01:01,"On Google Books, they go back to the very early 19th century, and that talks about it as a tradition"
00:01:01,00:01:07,"that's obviously been practiced for a long time, and it's a game they played where they'd get"
00:01:07,00:01:11,"a wool rust hide, and they'd attach it with ropes to four poles, and then they'd have lots"
00:01:11,00:01:14,"of holes drilled into the wool rust hide all around it, so people could get their hands"
00:01:14,00:01:18,"through the holes and pull on the holes, so they pull on the skin, and then they dump"
00:01:18,00:01:23,"somebody in the middle of the skin, and it's about waist height, it's suspended, and then"
00:01:23,00:01:26,"when everyone pulls on the holes at the same time, then obviously the skin flicks upwards,"
00:01:26,00:01:29,and it throws the person on them up in the end.
00:01:29,00:01:30,Wow.
00:01:30,00:01:32,"So we're going to say that counts as a trampoline, are we?"
00:01:32,00:01:38,"I think I am for the sake of this fact, no I think, because it's attached to things at"
00:01:38,00:01:39,the side.
00:01:39,00:01:40,People are holding...
00:01:40,00:01:43,"It sounds more like a, you know, when there's a fire in a building, and someone needs"
00:01:43,00:01:45,"to jump out, and there's people below with that fire net."
00:01:45,00:01:50,"Those are really interesting, I didn't really know about those, or you see them in old films"
00:01:50,00:01:53,"and things, there's one in Dumbo, isn't there?"
00:01:53,00:01:56,"You know, in the circus show, there are all the clowns and he covers it off of a burning"
00:01:56,00:01:57,building.
00:01:57,00:01:58,But Dumbo can fly.
00:01:58,00:02:01,"Well yeah, but they don't know that at the time they're planning the circus show."
00:02:01,00:02:06,"No, and also James Spoiler, very much alert."
00:02:06,00:02:10,"But anyway, we don't really know why people did this, it seems like a lot of people speculate,"
00:02:10,00:02:15,"but it could have been, for instance, in order to, when they were hunting, get one"
00:02:15,00:02:20,member of their tribe raised up high so that they could see for a long way where the nearest
00:02:20,00:02:24,"new walrus was to kill to make their new trampoline, or whatever."
00:02:24,00:02:28,"That's an amazing idea, and then gradually they noticed that the people were staying on"
00:02:28,00:02:29,it for ages.
00:02:29,00:02:32,"Oh, it's just one more go, guys."
00:02:32,00:02:35,I thought it's one something.
00:02:35,00:02:40,"I've read something about you've been framed, something like 40% of home video accidents videos"
00:02:40,00:02:44,that are sent in out of trampolining accidents.
00:02:44,00:02:45,That doesn't sound true to me.
00:02:45,00:02:46,It sounds so untrue.
00:02:46,00:02:50,"I don't know, because it's an occasion that you'd film someone being on a trampoline."
00:02:50,00:02:54,"I do see that, but from my memory of watching you've been framed it's usually cats and dogs"
00:02:54,00:02:55,doing stupid things.
00:02:55,00:02:56,"Oh, they weed out."
00:02:56,00:03:02,"They mostly take from the other 60%, but you can't just show incessant trampolines, people"
00:03:02,00:03:03,will get doors.
00:03:03,00:03:04,True.
00:03:04,00:03:05,But how many people own trampolines?
00:03:05,00:03:06,I thought everyone did.
00:03:06,00:03:07,Am I wrong?
00:03:07,00:03:11,Do you want to hear a headline from Scotland in 2010?
00:03:11,00:03:12,"Yes, please."
00:03:12,00:03:17,A man caught jumping up and down naked on a trampoline has avoided a jail sentence.
00:03:17,00:03:18,Okay.
00:03:18,00:03:24,"It was a man whose surname was Byrdon, and he had his manhood in one hand and a cigarette"
00:03:24,00:03:30,"in the other when he was spotted by the neighbor and a neighbor called the police, and he was"
00:03:30,00:03:32,arrested and charged with shameless indecency.
00:03:32,00:03:33,Wow.
00:03:33,00:03:37,And the prosecutor said he told police he had gone out to the trampoline and had masturbated
00:03:37,00:03:38,himself there.
00:03:38,00:03:41,So blanket tossing survives in some ways.
00:03:41,00:03:42,And asked why he did it.
00:03:42,00:03:45,Byrdon told officers just for the thrill of it.
00:03:45,00:03:52,"On the bus side, he did manage to win 250 quid when he sent in the video to you being framed."
00:03:52,00:03:58,"I was reading about the earliest modern trampolines, and I went to the Olympics website because"
00:03:58,00:04:00,they've got a history of trampolining on there.
00:04:00,00:04:06,"So the earliest that they have is 1934, and it was for astronauts."
00:04:06,00:04:10,And the idea was to get astronauts used to the idea of what space conditions might be.
00:04:10,00:04:14,It was the best kind of possible exercise for them to do.
00:04:14,00:04:16,How many astronauts were there in 1934?
00:04:16,00:04:19,That's a very good point.
00:04:19,00:04:20,There would have been none.
00:04:20,00:04:23,"I thought NASA used them, but not in the 30s."
00:04:23,00:04:28,"Maybe the modern trampoline was developed in 1934, and the NASA started using them down"
00:04:28,00:04:29,the line.
00:04:29,00:04:35,It was by two guys called George Nissen and Larry Griswold at the University of Iowa.
00:04:35,00:04:37,And they came up with this idea.
00:04:37,00:04:42,"And the guy, George Nissen, he was traveling in Spain, and he heard the word trampoline,"
00:04:42,00:04:47,"which meant the springboard, and he thought that's a good name, and he took it."
00:04:47,00:04:50,"So in Spanish, the word trampoline means springboard."
00:04:50,00:04:53,"And in Italian, it means stilts, isn't it?"
00:04:53,00:04:54,Not sure why.
00:04:54,00:04:55,Wow.
00:04:55,00:05:00,Those countries are arriving to the Olympics.
00:05:00,00:05:05,"Nissen always wanted it to be in the Olympics, but it wasn't until 2008."
00:05:05,00:05:09,"He was given the honour of testing out the first ever Olympic trampoline before the event,"
00:05:09,00:05:11,and he was 94 years old.
00:05:11,00:05:12,Wow.
00:05:12,00:05:14,"He died a couple of years later, but yeah."
00:05:14,00:05:15,He was really cool.
00:05:15,00:05:21,"His 80th birthday, apparently, had a big dinner party, and in the middle of the dinner party,"
00:05:21,00:05:24,he threw all the silverware aside and got onto the table and did a handstand.
00:05:24,00:05:25,But AC.
00:05:25,00:05:26,Wow.
00:05:26,00:05:27,What a fun guy.
00:05:27,00:05:32,"You do get kicked out of the restaurant for doing that, especially if you're naked with"
00:05:32,00:05:36,a cigarette in one hand.
00:05:36,00:05:38,Do you know how Nissen got the trampoline popularised?
00:05:38,00:05:39,No.
00:05:39,00:05:42,He jumped up and down on one with a kangaroo.
00:05:42,00:05:43,The kangaroo?
00:05:43,00:05:44,Yeah.
00:05:44,00:05:45,He's a kangaroo.
00:05:45,00:05:46,Does it go twice as high?
00:05:46,00:05:47,"Actually, this is interesting."
00:05:47,00:05:48,You say that.
00:05:48,00:05:51,You should all look up at home a YouTube video of a kangaroo that accidentally jumps onto
00:05:51,00:05:55,"someone's trampoline in America, and they filmed it, and it tries to jump off, and obviously"
00:05:55,00:05:59,"it doesn't have the consistency the kangaroo expects, and it just faceplans into the ground"
00:05:59,00:06:00,in front.
00:06:00,00:06:01,Wow.
00:06:01,00:06:06,"He had a higher kangaroo in 1960, and jumped up and down a trampoline with it, and apparently"
00:06:06,00:06:10,"locked eyes with it for ages, and had lots of photographs taken, and this photograph went"
00:06:10,00:06:12,viral all around the world.
00:06:12,00:06:14,"And people thought, yeah, that looks great."
00:06:14,00:06:16,They all hired trampolines and kangaroos.
00:06:16,00:06:18,Was that like a bundle deal that you had?
00:06:18,00:06:20,Travelling plus kangaroo for a 50-grid extra.
00:06:20,00:06:21,"No, they didn't."
00:06:21,00:06:23,They didn't actually hire out kangaroos.
00:06:23,00:06:29,"He also tried to invent a load of games, and so one of them was called Spaceball, and what"
00:06:29,00:06:34,"it was is you'd have four people on a massive trampoline, two on each side, and there'd be a wall"
00:06:34,00:06:38,"in between, and the wall would have a hole in it, and you'd try and throw the ball through"
00:06:38,00:06:42,"the hole, and hit a target on the other side of the trampoline, and the other guys would"
00:06:42,00:06:43,try and block it.
00:06:43,00:06:45,"Yeah, I think it sounds fantastic."
00:06:45,00:06:47,Sounds like a trampoline version of Quidditch.
00:06:47,00:06:50,"In Australia, we used to play trampoline volleyball."
00:06:50,00:06:51,That's so cool.
00:06:51,00:06:52,Is it?
00:06:52,00:06:53,Yeah.
00:06:53,00:06:56,There's a lot of trampoline games that get played out in Australia that I'm seeing over
00:06:56,00:06:57,here.
00:06:57,00:06:58,We don't have so many trampolines.
00:06:58,00:07:00,Australia's got so much space.
00:07:00,00:07:01,You can fit them in.
00:07:01,00:07:04,"Is that why you've got so many kangaroos, you just bought a load of trampolines, as well?"
00:07:04,00:07:06,They all came with a free kangaroo.
00:07:06,00:07:09,What do I do with this guy?
00:07:09,00:07:10,Yeah.
00:07:10,00:07:15,"Okay, so some other things that you can make using walruses, as well as trampolines."
00:07:15,00:07:20,"So, walrous stomach lining was used for sales by Inuit people."
00:07:20,00:07:26,"The shoulder blades were used as shovels, and the penis bones were used to make houses"
00:07:26,00:07:27,to brace the walls.
00:07:27,00:07:31,"So, to secure the flooring in the houses."
00:07:31,00:07:35,"And also, there were some Inuits in St. Lawrence Island who used the penis bones to make snow"
00:07:35,00:07:36,goggles.
00:07:36,00:07:37,Really?
00:07:37,00:07:38,Yeah.
00:07:38,00:07:40,"They used them as tent poles, as well."
00:07:40,00:07:41,Yeah.
00:07:41,00:07:42,And this is cool.
00:07:42,00:07:49,"You would live in a walrus home, so you would stretch the hideout over whale rib frames,"
00:07:49,00:07:51,or penis bone frames.
00:07:51,00:07:56,"And the windows would be made of stretched walrus gut, or stretched penis membrane from"
00:07:56,00:07:57,the walrus.
00:07:57,00:07:59,And the window in your walrus skin house.
00:07:59,00:08:00,How is that?
00:08:00,00:08:01,What does that mean?
00:08:01,00:08:02,What's a membrane?
00:08:02,00:08:03,Very thin piece of skin.
00:08:03,00:08:04,"A thin skin, I suppose."
00:08:04,00:08:05,Yeah.
00:08:05,00:08:08,"They also, apparently, their whiskers could be used as nose pickers."
00:08:08,00:08:13,"And you would like your home using walruses in the lamps, and you would also turn the intestines"
00:08:13,00:08:14,into your clothes.
00:08:14,00:08:17,"So, you were completely living inside a walrus, and you would eat."
00:08:17,00:08:18,Wow.
00:08:18,00:08:21,"They made frozen blocks of walrus meat, which they turned into."
00:08:21,00:08:24,"I find this impossible to believe, but I love it."
00:08:24,00:08:28,"And waste ledges, which you would eat as you went."
00:08:28,00:08:29,"Oh, yeah."
00:08:29,00:08:30,"Oh, my God."
00:08:30,00:08:34,"They, you know, Captain Cook's biographer says the closest he ever came to suffering a mutiny"
00:08:34,00:08:40,"was when he tried to make his men eat walrus, and they all vomited, and said it was disgusting."
00:08:40,00:08:45,"Captain Scott, when he was in the Antarctic, I was reading about this the other day."
00:08:45,00:08:49,"He tried to get, they tried to eat seals when they were going down the Antarctic, but"
00:08:49,00:08:52,"it was so disgusting, they hated the taste of it."
00:08:52,00:08:56,"So they boiled it really, really, really for ages to try and get rid of this kind of horrible"
00:08:56,00:08:58,fishy taste.
00:08:58,00:09:02,"Because they boiled it so much, it got rid of all of the vitamin C in there, and so they"
00:09:02,00:09:03,all caught scurvy.
00:09:03,00:09:04,"Oh, wow, really?"
00:09:04,00:09:07,"Yeah, but they didn't know at the time that's what was doing it, but yeah."
00:09:07,00:09:08,Wow.
00:09:08,00:09:09,That's really interesting.
00:09:09,00:09:10,But do you know how they hunt them?
00:09:10,00:09:14,"How the Alaskan Eskimo's hunt walrus, and how they have done for hundreds of years."
00:09:14,00:09:18,"They take a seal skin out, so apparently they're attracted to seal skin."
00:09:18,00:09:22,"They want to eat the seal skin, and they have it dragging behind the boat."
00:09:22,00:09:25,"Because walrus comes and then they kill it with a harpoon, and then in order to carry it"
00:09:25,00:09:28,"back to the shore, they inflate it with a tube."
00:09:28,00:09:32,"And so the walrus just floats behind the boat, like a little inflatable boy, like a boy."
00:09:32,00:09:33,Like a boy?
00:09:33,00:09:34,Exactly.
00:09:34,00:09:39,"Do you know that their mouths have a vacuum force suction, right?"
00:09:39,00:09:44,"When they eat seals, this is how strong their suction is, they can suck the skin off"
00:09:44,00:09:45,the seals.
00:09:45,00:09:46,What?
00:09:46,00:09:47,Yeah?
00:09:47,00:09:48,That's what I read.
00:09:48,00:09:49,Is that the best bit for the skin?
00:09:49,00:09:51,"No, they're trying to get to the meat, so they want that out of the way."
00:09:51,00:09:53,So then they spit it out.
00:09:53,00:09:54,"Yeah, yeah."
00:09:54,00:09:55,Okay.
00:09:55,00:09:56,It sounds so dubious.
00:09:56,00:10:00,"It's what I've got another amazing sounding thing about walrus, which I almost can't believe"
00:10:00,00:10:04,"is that they have these very strong muscles, and they can basically push their eyes out"
00:10:04,00:10:07,"a bit, so they can either look forwards or sideways."
00:10:07,00:10:12,"I read that when they're attacking seals, one way in which to kill them is that they"
00:10:12,00:10:13,drown them.
00:10:13,00:10:17,"So they've got incredibly strong grips, and they grip around them with a hug, which"
00:10:17,00:10:21,"often is confused a lot of humans, who, if they're in a sea world, that often"
00:10:21,00:10:25,"confuses a lot of people because it looks very friendly, but actually it's a really solid"
00:10:25,00:10:26,"grip, and they take you down."
00:10:26,00:10:30,"I just imagine being in sea world, and you're like, ""Oh look, that walrus is kissing that"
00:10:30,00:10:32,"seal, and then it rips its skin off."""
00:10:32,00:10:36,Oh my god.
00:10:36,00:10:48,"Okay, it is time for fact number two."
00:10:48,00:10:52,That is Andrew Hunter Murray.
00:10:52,00:10:56,My fact is that one suggested solution to the problem of storing nuclear waste for thousands
00:10:56,00:11:02,of years is putting up warning signs with Edward Monk's The Scream on them.
00:11:02,00:11:08,So this is particularly at New Mexico's waste isolation pilot plants.
00:11:08,00:11:13,"There are loads of nuclear storage facilities all over the world, whether you store all the"
00:11:13,00:11:20,"waste that you get from nuclear power plants, and the problem is that so far, I think the"
00:11:20,00:11:26,"whole industry has generated about 300,000 tons of the stuff, and it has to be protected"
00:11:26,00:11:30,"from all lifeforms for about 100,000 years."
00:11:30,00:11:36,"And I mean, it's 10,000 years since we invented farming, and some of it lasts for a million"
00:11:36,00:11:37,years.
00:11:37,00:11:40,So the idea that we're going to be able to clearly say to future civilisations.
00:11:40,00:11:43,We can hardly even understand Shakespeare and Chaucer and stuff.
00:11:43,00:11:44,Yeah.
00:11:44,00:11:48,"I know the Pyramids are 5,000 years ago, and we know what Herodless mean, but it's taken a lot"
00:11:48,00:11:49,of work.
00:11:49,00:11:52,"But the idea is, I guess, and it does kind of make sense, right?"
00:11:52,00:11:57,"The Edward Monk's The Scream, or however we're pronouncing his name, it just does look like"
00:11:57,00:12:02,"a human who's terrified, and you imagine that, unless we really physically evolve out of"
00:12:02,00:12:04,"looking at all like ourselves, it probably still won't have any experience."
00:12:04,00:12:08,"I don't know, because that emoji, which is a bit like the screen where he's got his hands"
00:12:08,00:12:11,"next to his face, that almost means, ""Wow!"""
00:12:11,00:12:12,"Oh, yeah."
00:12:12,00:12:13,So what have you done?
00:12:13,00:12:14,I've been using that wrong.
00:12:14,00:12:15,In just 50 years.
00:12:15,00:12:16,How have you like?
00:12:16,00:12:17,What are 50 years from now?
00:12:17,00:12:18,"That means awesome, cool thing."
00:12:18,00:12:19,Yeah.
00:12:19,00:12:20,"Great rollercoaster, right?"
00:12:20,00:12:21,Yeah.
00:12:21,00:12:24,"So they haven't actually done this, but this was one proposal, and there were other proposals"
00:12:24,00:12:29,"included, things like making a whole landscape nearby, full of jagged concrete spikes to make"
00:12:29,00:12:32,"it this horrible, foreboding place."
00:12:32,00:12:36,"I saw that suggestion, but then someone said there's a very big problem that usually when"
00:12:36,00:12:40,"you make big ugly things, they just get destroyed by the next generation."
00:12:40,00:12:41,Right.
00:12:41,00:12:42,Yeah.
00:12:42,00:12:46,"But the problem is, it's all, we have no idea what future societies are going to be like."
00:12:46,00:12:50,They might find ever mugs painting the screen unbelievably sexy and enticing.
00:12:50,00:12:51,Yeah.
00:12:51,00:12:53,That might be what an attractive person looks like in 2000 years.
00:12:53,00:12:57,"So it's a huge philosophical problem, and actually the French nuclear agency is called"
00:12:57,00:13:02,"Andrea, and it has a special memory division, and their job is to deal with these problems"
00:13:02,00:13:03,and to think about them.
00:13:03,00:13:06,"Yeah, there was one guy who said, ""My job is essentially to communicate with people"
00:13:06,00:13:10,"in the future,"" which is the coolest job, and I liked, I think it was him who was pointing"
00:13:10,00:13:14,"out one of the ways that things could be misinterpreted in the future, is if we drew"
00:13:14,00:13:18,"a little comic above dangerous sites, which showed a little diagram of a man walking into"
00:13:18,00:13:22,"a barrel of radioactive waste, and then the next one was his head exploding or something,"
00:13:22,00:13:26,"and the next one was his coffin, actually, in the future they might read backwards."
00:13:26,00:13:29,So they might think that it's something that brings you back to life again.
00:13:29,00:13:33,"They might think that if your head's exploded, this is a thing that gets the pieces of brain"
00:13:33,00:13:38,"from all the different parts and puts them all back together, and you definitely want"
00:13:38,00:13:39,to dig that up.
00:13:39,00:13:45,"That's like my parents, when they moved to Hong Kong, they lived on Redneck Cellar Road,"
00:13:45,00:13:49,"and no one could work out what Redneck Cellar was, they just had no idea, it turns out that"
00:13:49,00:13:54,"it was actually Alexander Road, but the person who was Chinese who was making the sign obviously"
00:13:54,00:14:04,"wrote from right to left, so Redneck Cell was very famous as an early example of that happening."
00:14:04,00:14:08,You guys must have all found that other thing about making GM cats.
00:14:08,00:14:13,"So what you do is you genetically modify cats so that whenever they see any radiation,"
00:14:13,00:14:14,they change colour.
00:14:14,00:14:19,"Then you also make a nursery rhyme saying, ""Little cat, little cat, if you change colour,"
00:14:19,00:14:22,"we're all going to die,"" and so people remember the nursery rhyme and see a cat's change"
00:14:22,00:14:25,"in colour and think, ""Oh, shit, that means we're all going to die,"" and so they stay away"
00:14:25,00:14:26,from the radiation.
00:14:26,00:14:32,"This was a thought experiment, I think, wasn't it, by philosophers in the 80s, from Swabasti"
00:14:32,00:14:34,and Paolo Fabri.
00:14:34,00:14:35,Yeah.
00:14:35,00:14:41,"I think the idea was that we've always, in human culture, been really interested in cats,"
00:14:41,00:14:45,"and they've always been important to us as symbols, so if we go way way into the future,"
00:14:45,00:14:49,"we can be reasonably sure, they think, that humans will still be watching cats and"
00:14:49,00:14:52,"still be taking note of them, and when they start glowing, they'll still be."
00:14:52,00:14:54,"There's no good way of doing it, I don't think we are going to crack this."
00:14:54,00:14:59,"I really like the idea of just making it really boring, so people don't want to go there."
00:14:59,00:15:00,Yeah.
00:15:00,00:15:04,"They're just making a completely wasteland, nothing there, put it 400 metres down, and hope"
00:15:04,00:15:05,that no one's going to go 400 metres down.
00:15:05,00:15:09,"It's just such a long time, that's the problem, you've no idea what's going on."
00:15:09,00:15:10,Or fire it into the sun.
00:15:10,00:15:13,"Well, it was discussed a lot, wasn't it, firing stuff into space, and I think the fear"
00:15:13,00:15:17,"was that if there were an accident in the atmosphere, and we had hundreds of thousands"
00:15:17,00:15:21,"of tons of radioactive waste on a craft that then exploded, it would just rain down"
00:15:21,00:15:22,upon us.
00:15:22,00:15:23,"It would feel so, so stupid."
00:15:23,00:15:25,Do you feel like an idiot?
00:15:25,00:15:26,Not for long.
00:15:26,00:15:27,But...
00:15:27,00:15:32,"I quite like the idea of the comic book, but then also having some kind of, you know, cracking"
00:15:32,00:15:36,"of an egg, so you can see the direction that time goes."
00:15:36,00:15:37,Do you know what I mean?
00:15:37,00:15:41,"So there are some things which are definitely one directional in time, due to entropy."
00:15:41,00:15:45,"So you could put those in the same direction as the comic book, and then they would realise"
00:15:45,00:15:47,"that they'll have time travel by then, James."
00:15:47,00:15:51,"But then, surely, we could just go forward in time to where they are."
00:15:51,00:15:52,"Oh, just tell them."
00:15:52,00:15:53,No.
00:15:53,00:15:54,They'll have time travel.
00:15:54,00:15:58,"Well, when they come back here to 2016, which was the most interesting year in the whole"
00:15:58,00:16:03,"of history, we can just go, oh, by the way, although that case, what are we worried about?"
00:16:03,00:16:04,We should just wait for the time travel.
00:16:04,00:16:07,"If there can't be people that do even develop time travel, I don't think they deserve"
00:16:07,00:16:10,to say these people.
00:16:10,00:16:11,Here's something.
00:16:11,00:16:15,"I love the idea of time travel is finally coming back, but just being seriously pissed"
00:16:15,00:16:16,off with us.
00:16:16,00:16:17,"It's an opening line, dude."
00:16:17,00:16:19,Was that weird scream guy you were supposed to say?
00:16:19,00:16:24,"Don't go into a massively radioactive, or do you put a picture of the most attractive woman"
00:16:24,00:16:28,for the 5 millionth century?
00:16:28,00:16:29,So the scream?
00:16:29,00:16:30,Yep.
00:16:30,00:16:31,Yep.
00:16:31,00:16:33,That guy is not screaming.
00:16:33,00:16:36,"Well, the scream is not coming from him."
00:16:36,00:16:41,"The whole point of that painting is it's a scream coming from nature, and he's kind of"
00:16:41,00:16:44,covering his ears to keep out the scream that's coming from nature.
00:16:44,00:16:49,Do we know what he meant by a screaming?
00:16:49,00:16:53,"I read something that he said, ""I was walking along the road with two friends."
00:16:53,00:16:57,"The sun was setting, suddenly the sky turned blood red."
00:16:57,00:17:00,"I paused, feeling exhausted and leaned on the fence."
00:17:00,00:17:05,"There was blood and tongues of fire above the blue, black fjord and the city."
00:17:05,00:17:11,My friends walked on and I stood there trembling with anxiety and I sensed an infinite scream passing
00:17:11,00:17:12,through nature.
00:17:12,00:17:14,"So it's almost like an anxiety attack, isn't it?"
00:17:14,00:17:15,Yeah.
00:17:15,00:17:20,"So after the eruption of, is it Cracotella?"
00:17:20,00:17:21,1880s?
00:17:21,00:17:24,"Yeah, so there had just been a volcanic eruption in Southeast Asia and so all the skies were"
00:17:24,00:17:30,quite weird and red and strange and they think that's where that came from.
00:17:30,00:17:33,Well people's face is also suddenly going weirdly curvy.
00:17:33,00:17:36,So I didn't know he did four versions of it.
00:17:36,00:17:50,"I'm one of the three ones, green two, green three."
00:17:50,00:17:54,"Okay, it is time for fact number three and that is my fact."
00:17:54,00:17:59,My fact this week is that Karl Marx used to do London pub crawls.
00:17:59,00:18:04,"So London pub crawls, for anyone overseas, that means jumping from bar to bar in a single"
00:18:04,00:18:07,evening and having a drink at each of those bars.
00:18:07,00:18:08,He managed to do 18 bars.
00:18:08,00:18:14,"So this is Karl Marx, who I've always associated as a deep philosophical thinker and not someone"
00:18:14,00:18:16,who was a pisshead.
00:18:16,00:18:21,"They went all the way up Tuntland Court Road, which is very close to where we work and there's"
00:18:21,00:18:26,not as many bars these days on it that were 18 in his day and they managed to do it.
00:18:26,00:18:31,"And at the end, they got all ladish and started breaking stuff in the street throwing rocks"
00:18:31,00:18:32,at lamps.
00:18:32,00:18:37,"Well, they had a bit of a sort of xenophobic brawl with a bunch of Englishmen and a pub,"
00:18:37,00:18:38,didn't they?
00:18:38,00:18:44,So Marx is one of the people that Marx is on this bar crawl with who is Wilhelm Legnecht
00:18:44,00:18:46,wrote about it later.
00:18:46,00:18:48,And so they got into some chats with some British guys and a pub and it all started off
00:18:48,00:18:55,very friendly and then they sort of started debating politics and he noted that at one
00:18:55,00:18:59,"point the British people, when they said Russian, they usually meant Prussian."
00:18:59,00:19:04,"It seems Russia and Prussia are frequently confounded in England, which feels like classic English."
00:19:04,00:19:07,"Russia, Prussia, whatever, completely different places, obviously."
00:19:07,00:19:08,Yeah.
00:19:08,00:19:11,"Yeah, then they decided to claim that Germans were culturally superior to English people"
00:19:11,00:19:15,"and so I think the English people decided to fight them, wanted to fist fight and they"
00:19:15,00:19:18,scarpered and then they decided to smash up some lamp post as they ran away.
00:19:18,00:19:23,"Do you know that Karl Marx, when he went on honeymoon with his wife, Jenny, took 45 books"
00:19:23,00:19:24,with him?
00:19:24,00:19:25,That's so insulting.
00:19:25,00:19:26,It's so rude.
00:19:26,00:19:29,Unless they were books on the art of good sex.
00:19:29,00:19:31,I don't think they can all have been.
00:19:31,00:19:32,"No, you've been in there with that many."
00:19:32,00:19:36,"In my experience, you only need a few of those, but they can't any holiday."
00:19:36,00:19:41,"Do you know, Jenny and Marx had four daughters who were born, three of them, five to adulthood,"
00:19:41,00:19:43,"and they were all called Jenny, bizarre."
00:19:43,00:19:44,"Oh, really?"
00:19:44,00:19:49,"Yeah, and then the son that they had is called Edgar, after Jenny's brother, weird."
00:19:49,00:19:53,I think my favourite thing that I read about Karl Marx is that obviously he's buried
00:19:53,00:19:58,"in high-gate cemetry and I've been to it, you can, if you live in London, it's worth going."
00:19:58,00:20:02,"Huge, huge tombstone with his head on the top of it."
00:20:02,00:20:06,And what I love is that there's constantly reports being made that Marxists who go to visit
00:20:06,00:20:11,him are furious that they have to pay to get into the graveyard and none of them realise
00:20:11,00:20:12,that when they get there.
00:20:12,00:20:14,I think he's buried next to Herbert Spencer.
00:20:14,00:20:15,He's covered him.
00:20:15,00:20:17,He's the philosopher who had an angry suit.
00:20:17,00:20:18,He got a suit when he was angry.
00:20:18,00:20:23,"And he also had theories that were very different to Marx's, so in Russia is always a joke that"
00:20:23,00:20:27,these two people are buried near each other and they're kind of arguing after death.
00:20:27,00:20:28,"Oh, really?"
00:20:28,00:20:30,The other joke is that Marx and Spencer.
00:20:30,00:20:31,"Oh, yes."
00:20:31,00:20:34,"I think they're opposite each other in fact, looking at each other."
00:20:34,00:20:35,Yeah.
00:20:35,00:20:38,Do you know Marx's biographer said one of his personal habits to inspire his creativity
00:20:38,00:20:43,"was to stand up to, he'll be at a table working and he'd stand up and he'd start walking"
00:20:43,00:20:46,around the table and he'd just walk faster and faster and faster and faster.
00:20:46,00:20:50,"And he found that was the way to make ideas come to him, just starting to be renting around"
00:20:50,00:20:51,the table.
00:20:51,00:20:52,It just sounds like you'd pass out.
00:20:52,00:20:55,I think he had a lot of boils on his bum as well.
00:20:55,00:20:56,He did.
00:20:56,00:20:57,Throughout life.
00:20:57,00:20:58,"So he found sitting incredibly hard, so."
00:20:58,00:20:59,Can I make sense?
00:20:59,00:21:01,Those two facts been connected?
00:21:01,00:21:02,"Yeah, exactly."
00:21:02,00:21:03,Yeah.
00:21:03,00:21:06,"Although they did, they do say that he would do the walking around as soon as the idea came"
00:21:06,00:21:07,to him.
00:21:07,00:21:10,He would immediately slam himself into a chair and start writing.
00:21:10,00:21:12,That doesn't sound like something you'd do with boils.
00:21:12,00:21:13,With boils.
00:21:13,00:21:14,You gently slide in.
00:21:14,00:21:15,Slytherin.
00:21:15,00:21:16,Slytherin.
00:21:16,00:21:17,Slytherin.
00:21:17,00:21:21,"That was one of the pubs he went to, actually."
00:21:21,00:21:26,"Yeah, the skin disease he had was really debilitating and he wrote to Engels saying he had boils all"
00:21:26,00:21:27,over his penis.
00:21:27,00:21:28,That was a nice letter to get.
00:21:28,00:21:33,"He had an Engels maybe who was there with a friend going, ""I have this philosopher, Marks,"
00:21:33,00:21:34,"I know what I'm saying."""
00:21:34,00:21:35,I just got letter from and he should read it.
00:21:35,00:21:37,He's an incredible brain.
00:21:37,00:21:41,"From each according to his ability, to each according to how many boils the lacer has on"
00:21:41,00:21:42,their pit.
00:21:42,00:21:44,We saw a letter of his just a few days ago.
00:21:44,00:21:48,You and I were at the British library and they have this incredible treasures room where
00:21:48,00:21:53,they have original writings from Dickens and Thomas Hardy and everyone.
00:21:53,00:21:55,"God, is every single person you'd want to see the handwriting of?"
00:21:55,00:21:56,Yeah.
00:21:56,00:21:57,You'll see it there in this room.
00:21:57,00:22:01,And they have a letter from Marks to Engels and they used to write in pseudonyms.
00:22:01,00:22:02,They used to have...
00:22:02,00:22:07,I'm not surprised to hear that most of what they were writing about.
00:22:07,00:22:08,Just on pub crawls.
00:22:08,00:22:09,Uh-huh.
00:22:09,00:22:10,Yeah.
00:22:10,00:22:11,Uh-huh.
00:22:11,00:22:12,Uh-huh.
00:22:12,00:22:13,"There is an Oliver Reed pub crawl in Wimbledon, which is my hometown."
00:22:13,00:22:14,Yeah.
00:22:14,00:22:18,"And it's eight different pubs and the record for it is two complete laps, i.e. 16 pubs"
00:22:18,00:22:21,having a pint in each and it is held by Oliver Reed.
00:22:21,00:22:25,"After he completed the 16 pubs, he threw up on Steve McQueen."
00:22:25,00:22:26,[laughter]
00:22:26,00:22:27,Good name.
00:22:27,00:22:33,"Um, have you seen these guys, um, who are trying to go to every pub in the UK?"
00:22:33,00:22:34,No.
00:22:34,00:22:35,No.
00:22:35,00:22:40,"There's a group of guys, um, they're known as the black country ale testers."
00:22:40,00:22:41,So I assume they're from the middle in somewhere.
00:22:41,00:22:50,"Uh, and they've done over 18,000 pubs in the UK, including every single one of the 3,905 pubs"
00:22:50,00:22:51,in Wales.
00:22:51,00:22:52,Wow.
00:22:52,00:22:53,Okay.
00:22:53,00:22:56,There used to be more of them and then I think one of them died and a few of them stopped
00:22:56,00:22:59,"when they reached 18,000, um, but some of them are still going."
00:22:59,00:23:00,Wow.
00:23:00,00:23:03,"There was an interview with one of them in the newspaper and he said, ""Now a day is I try"
00:23:03,00:23:06,"to limit myself to 1,500 pints a year."""
00:23:06,00:23:07,[laughter]
00:23:07,00:23:10,"Well, that is restraint if I ever heard it."
00:23:10,00:23:14,But they don't think they'll ever get every single one in the UK because it's just too many.
00:23:14,00:23:15,Because they just keep making new ones.
00:23:15,00:23:20,"There's a similar, uh, problem that is had by the woman who's visited the most weather"
00:23:20,00:23:21,spoons in the UK.
00:23:21,00:23:27,"This woman called Mags Thompson and she's been to 972 and that was out of 2014, I think."
00:23:27,00:23:30,But she says it's just very hard to keep up because they keep popping up everywhere.
00:23:30,00:23:31,[laughter]
00:23:31,00:23:34,"Well, they all at the same night and then she vomits it on Stephen Queen."
00:23:34,00:23:35,[laughter]
00:23:35,00:23:37,"She said, ""It's a good conversation point."
00:23:37,00:23:41,"If I meet someone from say Swansea, I can say I know Swansea."
00:23:41,00:23:43,"Nice weather spoons there."""
00:23:43,00:23:44,[laughter]
00:23:44,00:23:46,[music]
00:23:46,00:23:56,"Okay, it's time for our final fact of the show and that is James."
00:23:56,00:24:00,"Okay, my fact this week is that there is an insect in New Zealand who catches its prey"
00:24:00,00:24:03,by pretending to be a star.
00:24:03,00:24:07,Which star does it pretend to be Stephen Queen?
00:24:07,00:24:08,[laughter]
00:24:08,00:24:15,"No, these are glowworms, they live in a cave and they all live on the ceiling and there's"
00:24:15,00:24:19,loads of them and they pretend to be stars in the night sky and there are other insects
00:24:19,00:24:23,in there who navigate using the stars and they get confused by these glowworms pretending
00:24:23,00:24:28,to be stars and then they fly into their lures and they get eaten.
00:24:28,00:24:29,"Yeah, it's amazing."
00:24:29,00:24:30,It's pretty cool.
00:24:30,00:24:34,And it requires serious cooperation unless you want to be a star on a really cloudy night
00:24:34,00:24:36,"then they're all working together, aren't they?"
00:24:36,00:24:37,"Yeah, that's true."
00:24:37,00:24:42,"I don't think they do exactly the same, they don't do Ryan's belt and all that goes."
00:24:42,00:24:43,[laughter]
00:24:43,00:24:44,Amazing.
00:24:44,00:24:45,"But yeah, they just generally look like stars."
00:24:45,00:24:51,So it's in the Wytomo Cave which is in New Zealand and I read this in an article on the
00:24:51,00:24:53,online magazine Deep Look.
00:24:53,00:25:01,"There's a species called Arachnocamper luminoza and yeah, there's moths and stuff in this cave"
00:25:01,00:25:06,and there's like little bit of mucas coming down and the moths fly into the mucas and then
00:25:06,00:25:07,they can gobble them up.
00:25:07,00:25:08,"Oh, lovely way to go."
00:25:08,00:25:12,You should put up a picture on your Twitter because it looks unbelievable.
00:25:12,00:25:13,I will.
00:25:13,00:25:16,"If you go to my Twitter @egshaped, I'll put that picture up."
00:25:16,00:25:17,Yeah.
00:25:17,00:25:20,"I really like as well that the glow, they can change the glow."
00:25:20,00:25:25,"So if one of the larvae next to them has eaten, it just calms down a bit and if there's a hungry"
00:25:25,00:25:27,"one next to it, it glows harder like this way."
00:25:27,00:25:28,Wow.
00:25:28,00:25:29,Come on.
00:25:29,00:25:30,"Yeah, it just puts out more glow."
00:25:30,00:25:31,That's great.
00:25:31,00:25:32,Wow.
00:25:32,00:25:34,"I think for most female glowworms, the harder they glow, the more eggs they have."
00:25:34,00:25:39,So it is actually a good thing for a male to see a glowworm that's really glowing like
00:25:39,00:25:44,hell because it means that she's more likely to be fertile.
00:25:44,00:25:47,"But by total coincidence, this weekend, I was hanging out with glowworms, which is"
00:25:47,00:25:50,"weird because I don't think we've ever talked about them before, but yeah, I was in Cornwall"
00:25:50,00:25:55,in a place called Kajweth where everyone should go because it's one of the only guaranteed
00:25:55,00:25:57,glowworm sighting places.
00:25:57,00:25:59,Shot the people of Kajweth will love that now.
00:25:59,00:26:04,It's got a very nice weather spoon.
00:26:04,00:26:06,It does not have a weather spoon.
00:26:06,00:26:07,But they are incredible.
00:26:07,00:26:11,They do look like something that sci-fi has created and there's this one in particular
00:26:11,00:26:16,"I love that's called the railroad worm, which has a body that glows green and a head that"
00:26:16,00:26:20,glows red and it's called the railroad worm because it looks like a set of railway tracks.
00:26:20,00:26:24,"It's got little green dots up either side of its body that lead to a red light, but it's"
00:26:24,00:26:26,like a little worm traffic line.
00:26:26,00:26:27,That's amazing.
00:26:27,00:26:28,It's beautiful.
00:26:28,00:26:29,Look it up.
00:26:29,00:26:34,"I was reading the UK glowworm survey website because there are, I think a few hundred places"
00:26:34,00:26:38,"in the UK where you can see glowworms, but not as good as this one though."
00:26:38,00:26:42,"Yeah, and I think there's no words in the world that's like the white term okay but one"
00:26:42,00:26:46,"of the headings on the UK glowworm website is, is it really a glowworm?"
00:26:46,00:26:53,"And then it says, one cause of false reports of glowworms is actually light reflected from"
00:26:53,00:26:57,shiny leaves due on litter.
00:26:57,00:27:02,Please check what you see really is a beetle with the light coming from the final tail segments.
00:27:02,00:27:04,Not a solid vinegar crisp bucket.
00:27:04,00:27:11,"Because that's what they are, the beetles aren't they, they're not worms."
00:27:11,00:27:15,"So actually I think they're in a bit of trouble in the UK aren't they glowworms, a lot of"
00:27:15,00:27:16,them are dying out.
00:27:16,00:27:19,"I think they're improving a bit now, but for a while they did."
00:27:19,00:27:25,One of the reasons is dog poo and apparently according to Nick Moise who's the assistant
00:27:25,00:27:29,"keeper at Derby Museum, he says the number of glowworms especially around him has gone"
00:27:29,00:27:36,down because dog poo creates more plant growth and they make it hard for the females and
00:27:36,00:27:40,males of the glowworm species to find each other because there's so much plant life.
00:27:40,00:27:44,That is fascinating and I'm going to take it up with Cajrith Council because they put
00:27:44,00:27:51,"a sign up on their cliff path which says, please excuse the overgrown path we like to encourage"
00:27:51,00:27:54,glowworms to hang out and breed here.
00:27:54,00:27:57,That is obviously just an excuse for what lazy path clearance.
00:27:57,00:27:58,That's interesting.
00:27:58,00:28:01,Oh Nick Moise at the Derby Museum is wrong.
00:28:01,00:28:03,So let's not jump to too many conglomerates.
00:28:03,00:28:07,All the other two different species of glowworm.
00:28:07,00:28:10,"No, but I'd like to see a fight between Nick Moise and Cajrith counting."
00:28:10,00:28:19,So I've been reading about various insects that live in caves and various animals so there's
00:28:19,00:28:24,one you might like to know about which is a species of cave insect called Neo-Trogler and
00:28:24,00:28:30,this is an interesting thing because the females have penises and the males have vaginas.
00:28:30,00:28:33,"Well, surely that makes some male and female, no?"
00:28:33,00:28:34,"Well, no, here's the thing."
00:28:34,00:28:40,"So the female, it's a penis like organ, I think it's technically known as a gyneosome and"
00:28:40,00:28:47,"it gets erections and it's spiny, like an old penis."
00:28:47,00:28:55,"So the female gets an erection in her gyneosome and the male has a vagina-like chamber, right?"
00:28:55,00:29:02,And the female inserts her penis into the male to hold it still and then it acts like a vacuum
00:29:02,00:29:04,cleaner and it sucks out the male's sperm.
00:29:04,00:29:05,Oh my gosh.
00:29:05,00:29:07,It's like the seal mollus all over.
00:29:07,00:29:10,You can do that up to 70 hours straight.
00:29:10,00:29:11,Wow.
00:29:11,00:29:12,"Yeah, and the thing is, the-"
00:29:12,00:29:13,70 hours.
00:29:13,00:29:14,70 hours.
00:29:14,00:29:18,"And the really interesting thing is that, I mean, well, that's the really interesting thing but"
00:29:18,00:29:20,this other thing.
00:29:20,00:29:24,So they're locked together unbelievably tightly due to these bristles and spines and pouches
00:29:24,00:29:27,in the males of gyneor and the bristles on the penis.
00:29:27,00:29:30,So there was a scientist from Hokkaido University of his experiment and he tried pulling
00:29:30,00:29:32,a copulating pair apart and the-
00:29:32,00:29:33,"Oh, why would you do that?"
00:29:33,00:29:34,"Well, I know."
00:29:34,00:29:38,I think that's worse because the male was then ripped in two.
00:29:38,00:29:40,"It's a bad end to a date, isn't it?"
00:29:40,00:29:42,You think it's going so well?
00:29:42,00:29:48,"And then, yeah, so that possibly means that males in the natural world can't actually resist"
00:29:48,00:29:50,the act of mating because they'll do themselves more damage.
00:29:50,00:29:51,Sure.
00:29:51,00:29:56,I looked at a couple of things on insect camouflage strategies or insects disguising themselves
00:29:56,00:29:58,as other things.
00:29:58,00:30:03,"So one of the things I love is that spiders, which obviously aren't insects, disguise"
00:30:03,00:30:08,themselves as ants by lifting up their two front legs and pretending that they're antenna
00:30:08,00:30:11,by waving them above their heads.
00:30:11,00:30:13,"So then they only have six legs, obviously."
00:30:13,00:30:14,"Yeah, then they've only got six legs left."
00:30:14,00:30:16,And then they lift another two and pretend to be a cow.
00:30:16,00:30:20,And then another two and pretend to be a human.
00:30:20,00:30:26,"They've found, not too long ago, that camouflage within insects has been going back very, very"
00:30:26,00:30:27,long-top.
00:30:27,00:30:29,"They've actually found, in amber, the earliest example of it."
00:30:29,00:30:35,"And it was found by a Chinese academy of sciences in Nanjing, by a team led by Bo Wang."
00:30:35,00:30:38,And it's called debris camouflage.
00:30:38,00:30:43,"And debris camouflage is when you just carry, effectively carrying a leaf on top of you."
00:30:43,00:30:49,But they've got examples of it where it definitely was trying to hide underneath the leaf.
00:30:49,00:30:52,"Just like, ""Sell it, say if he leaves you and pretend it to be a tree."""
00:30:52,00:30:53,Exactly.
00:30:53,00:30:56,And none of you has asked me why I've got an empty pack of salt and vinegar crisps on top
00:30:56,00:30:57,of my head.
00:30:57,00:31:02,"Okay, that probably was a glow worth it."
00:31:02,00:31:06,Orkids disguise themselves as wasps so that other wasps will have sex with them.
00:31:06,00:31:09,"Rather than just attracting the wasps to come and pick up pollen, they actually make wasps"
00:31:09,00:31:13,come and mate with them by emitting smells that smell like a wasp and making themselves
00:31:13,00:31:14,look like a wasp.
00:31:14,00:31:19,And 75% of wasps who land on these orkids do actually ejaculate.
00:31:19,00:31:22,"So they just go away thinking, ""Oh, I successfully had sex there."""
00:31:22,00:31:23,Isn't that weird?
00:31:23,00:31:25,I think they've just mated with a wasp.
00:31:25,00:31:30,"The good thing is humans, we have no idea what the thing is that is persuading us to have"
00:31:30,00:31:32,"sex with it by mentally, successfully mimicking a human isps."
00:31:32,00:31:44,"If I found out that my wife's been an orkid all this time, we don't know what's out there."
00:31:44,00:31:48,"Okay, that's it."
00:31:48,00:31:49,That's all of our facts.
00:31:49,00:31:51,Thank you so much for listening.
