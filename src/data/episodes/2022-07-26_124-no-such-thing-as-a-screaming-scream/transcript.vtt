00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.080
 They don't look at it, but it won't look at it.

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:14.680
 Hello, and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:17.560
 to you from the QI offices in Covert Garden.

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:23.080
 My name is Dad Shriver, I'm sitting here with Anish Zinski, James Harkin, and Andy Murray,

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:26.760
 and once again we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:33.160
 seven days, and in no particular order, here we go, starting with you Chazinski.

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:38.800
 My fact this week is that the first trampolines were made of wool or skin, and this is a thing

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:42.480
 that's called blanket tossing, and it's been practiced for the...

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.520
 My teenage boys for thousands of years.

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.560
 Okay, so blanket tossing is something that's been practiced by the Anupiat Eskimos up in Alaska

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:56.600
 for, we don't know exactly how long, but references to it go back to...

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:01.600
 On Google Books, they go back to the very early 19th century, and that talks about it as a tradition

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:07.240
 that's obviously been practiced for a long time, and it's a game they played where they'd get

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:11.360
 a wool rust hide, and they'd attach it with ropes to four poles, and then they'd have lots

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:14.800
 of holes drilled into the wool rust hide all around it, so people could get their hands

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:18.720
 through the holes and pull on the holes, so they pull on the skin, and then they dump

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.160
 somebody in the middle of the skin, and it's about waist height, it's suspended, and then

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:26.920
 when everyone pulls on the holes at the same time, then obviously the skin flicks upwards,

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:29.120
 and it throws the person on them up in the end.

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:30.120
 Wow.

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:32.840
 So we're going to say that counts as a trampoline, are we?

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:38.000
 I think I am for the sake of this fact, no I think, because it's attached to things at

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.000
 the side.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.000
 People are holding...

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.120
 It sounds more like a, you know, when there's a fire in a building, and someone needs

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:45.920
 to jump out, and there's people below with that fire net.

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:50.840
 Those are really interesting, I didn't really know about those, or you see them in old films

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:53.640
 and things, there's one in Dumbo, isn't there?

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.360
 You know, in the circus show, there are all the clowns and he covers it off of a burning

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:57.360
 building.

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:58.360
 But Dumbo can fly.

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:01.600
 Well yeah, but they don't know that at the time they're planning the circus show.

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:06.760
 No, and also James Spoiler, very much alert.

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:10.960
 But anyway, we don't really know why people did this, it seems like a lot of people speculate,

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:15.000
 but it could have been, for instance, in order to, when they were hunting, get one

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.680
 member of their tribe raised up high so that they could see for a long way where the nearest

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:24.120
 new walrus was to kill to make their new trampoline, or whatever.

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:28.680
 That's an amazing idea, and then gradually they noticed that the people were staying on

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:29.680
 it for ages.

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:32.120
 Oh, it's just one more go, guys.

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:35.160
 I thought it's one something.

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:40.920
 I've read something about you've been framed, something like 40% of home video accidents videos

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:44.600
 that are sent in out of trampolining accidents.

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:45.600
 That doesn't sound true to me.

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:46.600
 It sounds so untrue.

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:50.400
 I don't know, because it's an occasion that you'd film someone being on a trampoline.

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:54.760
 I do see that, but from my memory of watching you've been framed it's usually cats and dogs

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:55.760
 doing stupid things.

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:56.960
 Oh, they weed out.

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:02.200
 They mostly take from the other 60%, but you can't just show incessant trampolines, people

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:03.200
 will get doors.

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:04.200
 True.

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:05.200
 But how many people own trampolines?

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:06.200
 I thought everyone did.

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:07.200
 Am I wrong?

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:11.040
 Do you want to hear a headline from Scotland in 2010?

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:12.040
 Yes, please.

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:17.200
 A man caught jumping up and down naked on a trampoline has avoided a jail sentence.

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:18.200
 Okay.

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:24.120
 It was a man whose surname was Byrdon, and he had his manhood in one hand and a cigarette

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:30.000
 in the other when he was spotted by the neighbor and a neighbor called the police, and he was

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.320
 arrested and charged with shameless indecency.

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:33.320
 Wow.

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:37.160
 And the prosecutor said he told police he had gone out to the trampoline and had masturbated

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:38.160
 himself there.

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:41.480
 So blanket tossing survives in some ways.

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:42.480
 And asked why he did it.

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:45.200
 Byrdon told officers just for the thrill of it.

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:52.280
 On the bus side, he did manage to win 250 quid when he sent in the video to you being framed.

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:58.720
 I was reading about the earliest modern trampolines, and I went to the Olympics website because

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:00.520
 they've got a history of trampolining on there.

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:06.080
 So the earliest that they have is 1934, and it was for astronauts.

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:10.840
 And the idea was to get astronauts used to the idea of what space conditions might be.

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:14.400
 It was the best kind of possible exercise for them to do.

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:16.720
 How many astronauts were there in 1934?

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:19.080
 That's a very good point.

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:20.560
 There would have been none.

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:23.080
 I thought NASA used them, but not in the 30s.

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:28.600
 Maybe the modern trampoline was developed in 1934, and the NASA started using them down

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:29.600
 the line.

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:35.360
 It was by two guys called George Nissen and Larry Griswold at the University of Iowa.

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:37.200
 And they came up with this idea.

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:42.960
 And the guy, George Nissen, he was traveling in Spain, and he heard the word trampoline,

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:47.280
 which meant the springboard, and he thought that's a good name, and he took it.

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:50.280
 So in Spanish, the word trampoline means springboard.

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:53.840
 And in Italian, it means stilts, isn't it?

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:54.840
 Not sure why.

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:55.840
 Wow.

00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:00.480
 Those countries are arriving to the Olympics.

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:05.120
 Nissen always wanted it to be in the Olympics, but it wasn't until 2008.

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:09.880
 He was given the honour of testing out the first ever Olympic trampoline before the event,

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:11.680
 and he was 94 years old.

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:12.680
 Wow.

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:14.720
 He died a couple of years later, but yeah.

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:15.720
 He was really cool.

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:21.120
 His 80th birthday, apparently, had a big dinner party, and in the middle of the dinner party,

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:24.560
 he threw all the silverware aside and got onto the table and did a handstand.

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:25.560
 But AC.

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:26.560
 Wow.

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:27.560
 What a fun guy.

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:32.560
 You do get kicked out of the restaurant for doing that, especially if you're naked with

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:36.160
 a cigarette in one hand.

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:38.960
 Do you know how Nissen got the trampoline popularised?

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:39.960
 No.

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:42.760
 He jumped up and down on one with a kangaroo.

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:43.760
 The kangaroo?

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:44.760
 Yeah.

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:45.760
 He's a kangaroo.

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:46.760
 Does it go twice as high?

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:47.760
 Actually, this is interesting.

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:48.760
 You say that.

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:51.560
 You should all look up at home a YouTube video of a kangaroo that accidentally jumps onto

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:55.280
 someone's trampoline in America, and they filmed it, and it tries to jump off, and obviously

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:59.720
 it doesn't have the consistency the kangaroo expects, and it just faceplans into the ground

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:00.720
 in front.

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:01.720
 Wow.

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:06.960
 He had a higher kangaroo in 1960, and jumped up and down a trampoline with it, and apparently

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:10.660
 locked eyes with it for ages, and had lots of photographs taken, and this photograph went

00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:12.400
 viral all around the world.

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:14.160
 And people thought, yeah, that looks great.

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:16.040
 They all hired trampolines and kangaroos.

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:18.400
 Was that like a bundle deal that you had?

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:20.960
 Travelling plus kangaroo for a 50-grid extra.

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:21.960
 No, they didn't.

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:23.840
 They didn't actually hire out kangaroos.

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:29.240
 He also tried to invent a load of games, and so one of them was called Spaceball, and what

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:34.280
 it was is you'd have four people on a massive trampoline, two on each side, and there'd be a wall

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:38.600
 in between, and the wall would have a hole in it, and you'd try and throw the ball through

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:42.680
 the hole, and hit a target on the other side of the trampoline, and the other guys would

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:43.680
 try and block it.

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:45.040
 Yeah, I think it sounds fantastic.

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:47.880
 Sounds like a trampoline version of Quidditch.

00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:50.480
 In Australia, we used to play trampoline volleyball.

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:51.480
 That's so cool.

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:52.480
 Is it?

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:53.480
 Yeah.

00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:56.160
 There's a lot of trampoline games that get played out in Australia that I'm seeing over

00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:57.160
 here.

00:06:57.160 --> 00:06:58.160
 We don't have so many trampolines.

00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:00.240
 Australia's got so much space.

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:01.240
 You can fit them in.

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:04.880
 Is that why you've got so many kangaroos, you just bought a load of trampolines, as well?

00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:06.760
 They all came with a free kangaroo.

00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:09.360
 What do I do with this guy?

00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:10.360
 Yeah.

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:15.000
 Okay, so some other things that you can make using walruses, as well as trampolines.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:20.840
 So, walrous stomach lining was used for sales by Inuit people.

00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:26.240
 The shoulder blades were used as shovels, and the penis bones were used to make houses

00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:27.960
 to brace the walls.

00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:31.120
 So, to secure the flooring in the houses.

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:35.560
 And also, there were some Inuits in St. Lawrence Island who used the penis bones to make snow

00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:36.560
 goggles.

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:37.560
 Really?

00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:38.560
 Yeah.

00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:40.320
 They used them as tent poles, as well.

00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:41.320
 Yeah.

00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:42.320
 And this is cool.

00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:49.360
 You would live in a walrus home, so you would stretch the hideout over whale rib frames,

00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:51.080
 or penis bone frames.

00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:56.160
 And the windows would be made of stretched walrus gut, or stretched penis membrane from

00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:57.160
 the walrus.

00:07:57.160 --> 00:07:59.160
 And the window in your walrus skin house.

00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:00.160
 How is that?

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:01.160
 What does that mean?

00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:02.160
 What's a membrane?

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:03.160
 Very thin piece of skin.

00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:04.160
 A thin skin, I suppose.

00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:05.160
 Yeah.

00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:08.240
 They also, apparently, their whiskers could be used as nose pickers.

00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:13.320
 And you would like your home using walruses in the lamps, and you would also turn the intestines

00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:14.320
 into your clothes.

00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:17.120
 So, you were completely living inside a walrus, and you would eat.

00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:18.120
 Wow.

00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:21.800
 They made frozen blocks of walrus meat, which they turned into.

00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:24.040
 I find this impossible to believe, but I love it.

00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:28.280
 And waste ledges, which you would eat as you went.

00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:29.280
 Oh, yeah.

00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:30.280
 Oh, my God.

00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:34.600
 They, you know, Captain Cook's biographer says the closest he ever came to suffering a mutiny

00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:40.520
 was when he tried to make his men eat walrus, and they all vomited, and said it was disgusting.

00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:45.200
 Captain Scott, when he was in the Antarctic, I was reading about this the other day.

00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:49.960
 He tried to get, they tried to eat seals when they were going down the Antarctic, but

00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:52.480
 it was so disgusting, they hated the taste of it.

00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:56.960
 So they boiled it really, really, really for ages to try and get rid of this kind of horrible

00:08:56.960 --> 00:08:58.800
 fishy taste.

00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:02.640
 Because they boiled it so much, it got rid of all of the vitamin C in there, and so they

00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:03.640
 all caught scurvy.

00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:04.640
 Oh, wow, really?

00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:07.480
 Yeah, but they didn't know at the time that's what was doing it, but yeah.

00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:08.480
 Wow.

00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:09.480
 That's really interesting.

00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:10.680
 But do you know how they hunt them?

00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:14.960
 How the Alaskan Eskimo's hunt walrus, and how they have done for hundreds of years.

00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:18.040
 They take a seal skin out, so apparently they're attracted to seal skin.

00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:22.400
 They want to eat the seal skin, and they have it dragging behind the boat.

00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:25.440
 Because walrus comes and then they kill it with a harpoon, and then in order to carry it

00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:28.200
 back to the shore, they inflate it with a tube.

00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:32.680
 And so the walrus just floats behind the boat, like a little inflatable boy, like a boy.

00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:33.680
 Like a boy?

00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:34.680
 Exactly.

00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:39.640
 Do you know that their mouths have a vacuum force suction, right?

00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:44.360
 When they eat seals, this is how strong their suction is, they can suck the skin off

00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:45.360
 the seals.

00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:46.360
 What?

00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:47.360
 Yeah?

00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:48.360
 That's what I read.

00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:49.360
 Is that the best bit for the skin?

00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:51.520
 No, they're trying to get to the meat, so they want that out of the way.

00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:53.000
 So then they spit it out.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:54.000
 Yeah, yeah.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:55.000
 Okay.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:56.000
 It sounds so dubious.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:00.280
 It's what I've got another amazing sounding thing about walrus, which I almost can't believe

00:10:00.280 --> 00:10:04.600
 is that they have these very strong muscles, and they can basically push their eyes out

00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:07.880
 a bit, so they can either look forwards or sideways.

00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:12.120
 I read that when they're attacking seals, one way in which to kill them is that they

00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:13.120
 drown them.

00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:17.360
 So they've got incredibly strong grips, and they grip around them with a hug, which

00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:21.440
 often is confused a lot of humans, who, if they're in a sea world, that often

00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:25.480
 confuses a lot of people because it looks very friendly, but actually it's a really solid

00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:26.960
 grip, and they take you down.

00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:30.840
 I just imagine being in sea world, and you're like, "Oh look, that walrus is kissing that

00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:32.920
 seal, and then it rips its skin off."

00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:36.920
 Oh my god.

00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:48.960
 Okay, it is time for fact number two.

00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:52.120
 That is Andrew Hunter Murray.

00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:56.120
 My fact is that one suggested solution to the problem of storing nuclear waste for thousands

00:10:56.120 --> 00:11:02.840
 of years is putting up warning signs with Edward Monk's The Scream on them.

00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:08.560
 So this is particularly at New Mexico's waste isolation pilot plants.

00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:13.280
 There are loads of nuclear storage facilities all over the world, whether you store all the

00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:20.360
 waste that you get from nuclear power plants, and the problem is that so far, I think the

00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:26.400
 whole industry has generated about 300,000 tons of the stuff, and it has to be protected

00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:30.360
 from all lifeforms for about 100,000 years.

00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:36.040
 And I mean, it's 10,000 years since we invented farming, and some of it lasts for a million

00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:37.040
 years.

00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:40.360
 So the idea that we're going to be able to clearly say to future civilisations.

00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:43.600
 We can hardly even understand Shakespeare and Chaucer and stuff.

00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:44.600
 Yeah.

00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:48.360
 I know the Pyramids are 5,000 years ago, and we know what Herodless mean, but it's taken a lot

00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:49.360
 of work.

00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:52.040
 But the idea is, I guess, and it does kind of make sense, right?

00:11:52.040 --> 00:11:57.040
 The Edward Monk's The Scream, or however we're pronouncing his name, it just does look like

00:11:57.040 --> 00:12:02.000
 a human who's terrified, and you imagine that, unless we really physically evolve out of

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.880
 looking at all like ourselves, it probably still won't have any experience.

00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:08.320
 I don't know, because that emoji, which is a bit like the screen where he's got his hands

00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:11.680
 next to his face, that almost means, "Wow!"

00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:12.680
 Oh, yeah.

00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:13.680
 So what have you done?

00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:14.680
 I've been using that wrong.

00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:15.680
 In just 50 years.

00:12:15.680 --> 00:12:16.680
 How have you like?

00:12:16.680 --> 00:12:17.680
 What are 50 years from now?

00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:18.680
 That means awesome, cool thing.

00:12:18.680 --> 00:12:19.680
 Yeah.

00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:20.680
 Great rollercoaster, right?

00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:21.680
 Yeah.

00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:24.760
 So they haven't actually done this, but this was one proposal, and there were other proposals

00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:29.760
 included, things like making a whole landscape nearby, full of jagged concrete spikes to make

00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:32.400
 it this horrible, foreboding place.

00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:36.280
 I saw that suggestion, but then someone said there's a very big problem that usually when

00:12:36.280 --> 00:12:40.080
 you make big ugly things, they just get destroyed by the next generation.

00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:41.080
 Right.

00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:42.080
 Yeah.

00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:46.680
 But the problem is, it's all, we have no idea what future societies are going to be like.

00:12:46.680 --> 00:12:50.000
 They might find ever mugs painting the screen unbelievably sexy and enticing.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:51.000
 Yeah.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.480
 That might be what an attractive person looks like in 2000 years.

00:12:53.480 --> 00:12:57.040
 So it's a huge philosophical problem, and actually the French nuclear agency is called

00:12:57.040 --> 00:13:02.120
 Andrea, and it has a special memory division, and their job is to deal with these problems

00:13:02.120 --> 00:13:03.120
 and to think about them.

00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:06.200
 Yeah, there was one guy who said, "My job is essentially to communicate with people

00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:10.920
 in the future," which is the coolest job, and I liked, I think it was him who was pointing

00:13:10.920 --> 00:13:14.400
 out one of the ways that things could be misinterpreted in the future, is if we drew

00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:18.720
 a little comic above dangerous sites, which showed a little diagram of a man walking into

00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:22.720
 a barrel of radioactive waste, and then the next one was his head exploding or something,

00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:26.680
 and the next one was his coffin, actually, in the future they might read backwards.

00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:29.400
 So they might think that it's something that brings you back to life again.

00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:33.560
 They might think that if your head's exploded, this is a thing that gets the pieces of brain

00:13:33.560 --> 00:13:38.360
 from all the different parts and puts them all back together, and you definitely want

00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:39.360
 to dig that up.

00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:45.360
 That's like my parents, when they moved to Hong Kong, they lived on Redneck Cellar Road,

00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:49.880
 and no one could work out what Redneck Cellar was, they just had no idea, it turns out that

00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:54.640
 it was actually Alexander Road, but the person who was Chinese who was making the sign obviously

00:13:54.640 --> 00:14:04.040
 wrote from right to left, so Redneck Cell was very famous as an early example of that happening.

00:14:04.040 --> 00:14:08.800
 You guys must have all found that other thing about making GM cats.

00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:13.560
 So what you do is you genetically modify cats so that whenever they see any radiation,

00:14:13.560 --> 00:14:14.880
 they change colour.

00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:19.000
 Then you also make a nursery rhyme saying, "Little cat, little cat, if you change colour,

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.800
 we're all going to die," and so people remember the nursery rhyme and see a cat's change

00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:25.840
 in colour and think, "Oh, shit, that means we're all going to die," and so they stay away

00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:26.840
 from the radiation.

00:14:26.840 --> 00:14:32.840
 This was a thought experiment, I think, wasn't it, by philosophers in the 80s, from Swabasti

00:14:32.840 --> 00:14:34.160
 and Paolo Fabri.

00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:35.160
 Yeah.

00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:41.240
 I think the idea was that we've always, in human culture, been really interested in cats,

00:14:41.240 --> 00:14:45.320
 and they've always been important to us as symbols, so if we go way way into the future,

00:14:45.320 --> 00:14:49.400
 we can be reasonably sure, they think, that humans will still be watching cats and

00:14:49.400 --> 00:14:52.200
 still be taking note of them, and when they start glowing, they'll still be.

00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:54.920
 There's no good way of doing it, I don't think we are going to crack this.

00:14:54.920 --> 00:14:59.000
 I really like the idea of just making it really boring, so people don't want to go there.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:00.000
 Yeah.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:04.120
 They're just making a completely wasteland, nothing there, put it 400 metres down, and hope

00:15:04.120 --> 00:15:05.920
 that no one's going to go 400 metres down.

00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:09.960
 It's just such a long time, that's the problem, you've no idea what's going on.

00:15:09.960 --> 00:15:10.960
 Or fire it into the sun.

00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:13.880
 Well, it was discussed a lot, wasn't it, firing stuff into space, and I think the fear

00:15:13.880 --> 00:15:17.480
 was that if there were an accident in the atmosphere, and we had hundreds of thousands

00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:21.400
 of tons of radioactive waste on a craft that then exploded, it would just rain down

00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:22.160
 upon us.

00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:23.960
 It would feel so, so stupid.

00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:25.520
 Do you feel like an idiot?

00:15:25.520 --> 00:15:26.520
 Not for long.

00:15:26.520 --> 00:15:27.520
 But...

00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:32.880
 I quite like the idea of the comic book, but then also having some kind of, you know, cracking

00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:36.120
 of an egg, so you can see the direction that time goes.

00:15:36.120 --> 00:15:37.440
 Do you know what I mean?

00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:41.720
 So there are some things which are definitely one directional in time, due to entropy.

00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:45.040
 So you could put those in the same direction as the comic book, and then they would realise

00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:47.080
 that they'll have time travel by then, James.

00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:51.960
 But then, surely, we could just go forward in time to where they are.

00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:52.960
 Oh, just tell them.

00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:53.960
 No.

00:15:53.960 --> 00:15:54.960
 They'll have time travel.

00:15:54.960 --> 00:15:58.960
 Well, when they come back here to 2016, which was the most interesting year in the whole

00:15:58.960 --> 00:16:03.320
 of history, we can just go, oh, by the way, although that case, what are we worried about?

00:16:03.320 --> 00:16:04.640
 We should just wait for the time travel.

00:16:04.640 --> 00:16:07.480
 If there can't be people that do even develop time travel, I don't think they deserve

00:16:07.480 --> 00:16:10.320
 to say these people.

00:16:10.320 --> 00:16:11.320
 Here's something.

00:16:11.320 --> 00:16:15.320
 I love the idea of time travel is finally coming back, but just being seriously pissed

00:16:15.320 --> 00:16:16.320
 off with us.

00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:17.320
 It's an opening line, dude.

00:16:17.320 --> 00:16:19.640
 Was that weird scream guy you were supposed to say?

00:16:19.640 --> 00:16:24.600
 Don't go into a massively radioactive, or do you put a picture of the most attractive woman

00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:28.240
 for the 5 millionth century?

00:16:28.240 --> 00:16:29.400
 So the scream?

00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:30.400
 Yep.

00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:31.400
 Yep.

00:16:31.400 --> 00:16:33.840
 That guy is not screaming.

00:16:33.840 --> 00:16:36.080
 Well, the scream is not coming from him.

00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:41.280
 The whole point of that painting is it's a scream coming from nature, and he's kind of

00:16:41.280 --> 00:16:44.840
 covering his ears to keep out the scream that's coming from nature.

00:16:44.840 --> 00:16:49.120
 Do we know what he meant by a screaming?

00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:53.720
 I read something that he said, "I was walking along the road with two friends.

00:16:53.720 --> 00:16:57.160
 The sun was setting, suddenly the sky turned blood red.

00:16:57.160 --> 00:17:00.400
 I paused, feeling exhausted and leaned on the fence.

00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:05.200
 There was blood and tongues of fire above the blue, black fjord and the city.

00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:11.200
 My friends walked on and I stood there trembling with anxiety and I sensed an infinite scream passing

00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:12.200
 through nature.

00:17:12.200 --> 00:17:14.480
 So it's almost like an anxiety attack, isn't it?

00:17:14.480 --> 00:17:15.480
 Yeah.

00:17:15.480 --> 00:17:20.840
 So after the eruption of, is it Cracotella?

00:17:20.840 --> 00:17:21.840
 1880s?

00:17:21.840 --> 00:17:24.560
 Yeah, so there had just been a volcanic eruption in Southeast Asia and so all the skies were

00:17:24.560 --> 00:17:30.320
 quite weird and red and strange and they think that's where that came from.

00:17:30.320 --> 00:17:33.560
 Well people's face is also suddenly going weirdly curvy.

00:17:33.560 --> 00:17:36.840
 So I didn't know he did four versions of it.

00:17:36.840 --> 00:17:50.120
 I'm one of the three ones, green two, green three.

00:17:50.120 --> 00:17:54.320
 Okay, it is time for fact number three and that is my fact.

00:17:54.320 --> 00:17:59.920
 My fact this week is that Karl Marx used to do London pub crawls.

00:17:59.920 --> 00:18:04.400
 So London pub crawls, for anyone overseas, that means jumping from bar to bar in a single

00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:07.120
 evening and having a drink at each of those bars.

00:18:07.120 --> 00:18:08.920
 He managed to do 18 bars.

00:18:08.920 --> 00:18:14.580
 So this is Karl Marx, who I've always associated as a deep philosophical thinker and not someone

00:18:14.580 --> 00:18:16.400
 who was a pisshead.

00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:21.320
 They went all the way up Tuntland Court Road, which is very close to where we work and there's

00:18:21.320 --> 00:18:26.120
 not as many bars these days on it that were 18 in his day and they managed to do it.

00:18:26.120 --> 00:18:31.600
 And at the end, they got all ladish and started breaking stuff in the street throwing rocks

00:18:31.600 --> 00:18:32.600
 at lamps.

00:18:32.600 --> 00:18:37.960
 Well, they had a bit of a sort of xenophobic brawl with a bunch of Englishmen and a pub,

00:18:37.960 --> 00:18:38.960
 didn't they?

00:18:38.960 --> 00:18:44.560
 So Marx is one of the people that Marx is on this bar crawl with who is Wilhelm Legnecht

00:18:44.560 --> 00:18:46.080
 wrote about it later.

00:18:46.080 --> 00:18:48.920
 And so they got into some chats with some British guys and a pub and it all started off

00:18:48.920 --> 00:18:55.640
 very friendly and then they sort of started debating politics and he noted that at one

00:18:55.640 --> 00:18:59.440
 point the British people, when they said Russian, they usually meant Prussian.

00:18:59.440 --> 00:19:04.080
 It seems Russia and Prussia are frequently confounded in England, which feels like classic English.

00:19:04.080 --> 00:19:07.040
 Russia, Prussia, whatever, completely different places, obviously.

00:19:07.040 --> 00:19:08.040
 Yeah.

00:19:08.040 --> 00:19:11.400
 Yeah, then they decided to claim that Germans were culturally superior to English people

00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:15.800
 and so I think the English people decided to fight them, wanted to fist fight and they

00:19:15.800 --> 00:19:18.760
 scarpered and then they decided to smash up some lamp post as they ran away.

00:19:18.760 --> 00:19:23.600
 Do you know that Karl Marx, when he went on honeymoon with his wife, Jenny, took 45 books

00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:24.600
 with him?

00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:25.600
 That's so insulting.

00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:26.600
 It's so rude.

00:19:26.600 --> 00:19:29.680
 Unless they were books on the art of good sex.

00:19:29.680 --> 00:19:31.640
 I don't think they can all have been.

00:19:31.640 --> 00:19:32.920
 No, you've been in there with that many.

00:19:32.920 --> 00:19:36.920
 In my experience, you only need a few of those, but they can't any holiday.

00:19:36.920 --> 00:19:41.800
 Do you know, Jenny and Marx had four daughters who were born, three of them, five to adulthood,

00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:43.760
 and they were all called Jenny, bizarre.

00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:44.760
 Oh, really?

00:19:44.760 --> 00:19:49.400
 Yeah, and then the son that they had is called Edgar, after Jenny's brother, weird.

00:19:49.400 --> 00:19:53.000
 I think my favourite thing that I read about Karl Marx is that obviously he's buried

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:58.600
 in high-gate cemetry and I've been to it, you can, if you live in London, it's worth going.

00:19:58.600 --> 00:20:02.720
 Huge, huge tombstone with his head on the top of it.

00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:06.720
 And what I love is that there's constantly reports being made that Marxists who go to visit

00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:11.400
 him are furious that they have to pay to get into the graveyard and none of them realise

00:20:11.400 --> 00:20:12.400
 that when they get there.

00:20:12.400 --> 00:20:14.760
 I think he's buried next to Herbert Spencer.

00:20:14.760 --> 00:20:15.760
 He's covered him.

00:20:15.760 --> 00:20:17.280
 He's the philosopher who had an angry suit.

00:20:17.280 --> 00:20:18.760
 He got a suit when he was angry.

00:20:18.760 --> 00:20:23.760
 And he also had theories that were very different to Marx's, so in Russia is always a joke that

00:20:23.760 --> 00:20:27.360
 these two people are buried near each other and they're kind of arguing after death.

00:20:27.360 --> 00:20:28.360
 Oh, really?

00:20:28.360 --> 00:20:30.160
 The other joke is that Marx and Spencer.

00:20:30.160 --> 00:20:31.160
 Oh, yes.

00:20:31.160 --> 00:20:34.120
 I think they're opposite each other in fact, looking at each other.

00:20:34.120 --> 00:20:35.120
 Yeah.

00:20:35.120 --> 00:20:38.920
 Do you know Marx's biographer said one of his personal habits to inspire his creativity

00:20:38.920 --> 00:20:43.840
 was to stand up to, he'll be at a table working and he'd stand up and he'd start walking

00:20:43.840 --> 00:20:46.600
 around the table and he'd just walk faster and faster and faster and faster.

00:20:46.600 --> 00:20:50.760
 And he found that was the way to make ideas come to him, just starting to be renting around

00:20:50.760 --> 00:20:51.760
 the table.

00:20:51.760 --> 00:20:52.760
 It just sounds like you'd pass out.

00:20:52.760 --> 00:20:55.560
 I think he had a lot of boils on his bum as well.

00:20:55.560 --> 00:20:56.560
 He did.

00:20:56.560 --> 00:20:57.560
 Throughout life.

00:20:57.560 --> 00:20:58.560
 So he found sitting incredibly hard, so.

00:20:58.560 --> 00:20:59.560
 Can I make sense?

00:20:59.560 --> 00:21:01.560
 Those two facts been connected?

00:21:01.560 --> 00:21:02.560
 Yeah, exactly.

00:21:02.560 --> 00:21:03.560
 Yeah.

00:21:03.560 --> 00:21:06.800
 Although they did, they do say that he would do the walking around as soon as the idea came

00:21:06.800 --> 00:21:07.800
 to him.

00:21:07.800 --> 00:21:10.160
 He would immediately slam himself into a chair and start writing.

00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:12.320
 That doesn't sound like something you'd do with boils.

00:21:12.320 --> 00:21:13.320
 With boils.

00:21:13.320 --> 00:21:14.320
 You gently slide in.

00:21:14.320 --> 00:21:15.320
 Slytherin.

00:21:15.320 --> 00:21:16.320
 Slytherin.

00:21:16.320 --> 00:21:17.320
 Slytherin.

00:21:17.320 --> 00:21:21.320
 That was one of the pubs he went to, actually.

00:21:21.320 --> 00:21:26.160
 Yeah, the skin disease he had was really debilitating and he wrote to Engels saying he had boils all

00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:27.160
 over his penis.

00:21:27.160 --> 00:21:28.920
 That was a nice letter to get.

00:21:28.920 --> 00:21:33.120
 He had an Engels maybe who was there with a friend going, "I have this philosopher, Marks,

00:21:33.120 --> 00:21:34.120
 I know what I'm saying."

00:21:34.120 --> 00:21:35.600
 I just got letter from and he should read it.

00:21:35.600 --> 00:21:37.120
 He's an incredible brain.

00:21:37.120 --> 00:21:41.160
 From each according to his ability, to each according to how many boils the lacer has on

00:21:41.160 --> 00:21:42.160
 their pit.

00:21:42.160 --> 00:21:44.160
 We saw a letter of his just a few days ago.

00:21:44.160 --> 00:21:48.760
 You and I were at the British library and they have this incredible treasures room where

00:21:48.760 --> 00:21:53.400
 they have original writings from Dickens and Thomas Hardy and everyone.

00:21:53.400 --> 00:21:55.960
 God, is every single person you'd want to see the handwriting of?

00:21:55.960 --> 00:21:56.960
 Yeah.

00:21:56.960 --> 00:21:57.960
 You'll see it there in this room.

00:21:57.960 --> 00:22:01.240
 And they have a letter from Marks to Engels and they used to write in pseudonyms.

00:22:01.240 --> 00:22:02.240
 They used to have...

00:22:02.240 --> 00:22:07.200
 I'm not surprised to hear that most of what they were writing about.

00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:08.200
 Just on pub crawls.

00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:09.200
 Uh-huh.

00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:10.200
 Yeah.

00:22:10.200 --> 00:22:11.200
 Uh-huh.

00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:12.200
 Uh-huh.

00:22:12.200 --> 00:22:13.200
 There is an Oliver Reed pub crawl in Wimbledon, which is my hometown.

00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:14.200
 Yeah.

00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:18.560
 And it's eight different pubs and the record for it is two complete laps, i.e. 16 pubs

00:22:18.560 --> 00:22:21.800
 having a pint in each and it is held by Oliver Reed.

00:22:21.800 --> 00:22:25.240
 After he completed the 16 pubs, he threw up on Steve McQueen.

00:22:25.240 --> 00:22:26.240
 [laughter]

00:22:26.240 --> 00:22:27.240
 Good name.

00:22:27.240 --> 00:22:33.360
 Um, have you seen these guys, um, who are trying to go to every pub in the UK?

00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:34.360
 No.

00:22:34.360 --> 00:22:35.360
 No.

00:22:35.360 --> 00:22:40.160
 There's a group of guys, um, they're known as the black country ale testers.

00:22:40.160 --> 00:22:41.920
 So I assume they're from the middle in somewhere.

00:22:41.920 --> 00:22:50.000
 Uh, and they've done over 18,000 pubs in the UK, including every single one of the 3,905 pubs

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:51.000
 in Wales.

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:52.000
 Wow.

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:53.000
 Okay.

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:56.080
 There used to be more of them and then I think one of them died and a few of them stopped

00:22:56.080 --> 00:22:59.280
 when they reached 18,000, um, but some of them are still going.

00:22:59.280 --> 00:23:00.280
 Wow.

00:23:00.280 --> 00:23:03.600
 There was an interview with one of them in the newspaper and he said, "Now a day is I try

00:23:03.600 --> 00:23:06.600
 to limit myself to 1,500 pints a year."

00:23:06.600 --> 00:23:07.600
 [laughter]

00:23:07.600 --> 00:23:10.840
 Well, that is restraint if I ever heard it.

00:23:10.840 --> 00:23:14.520
 But they don't think they'll ever get every single one in the UK because it's just too many.

00:23:14.520 --> 00:23:15.920
 Because they just keep making new ones.

00:23:15.920 --> 00:23:20.480
 There's a similar, uh, problem that is had by the woman who's visited the most weather

00:23:20.480 --> 00:23:21.480
 spoons in the UK.

00:23:21.480 --> 00:23:27.320
 This woman called Mags Thompson and she's been to 972 and that was out of 2014, I think.

00:23:27.320 --> 00:23:30.240
 But she says it's just very hard to keep up because they keep popping up everywhere.

00:23:30.240 --> 00:23:31.240
 [laughter]

00:23:31.240 --> 00:23:34.320
 Well, they all at the same night and then she vomits it on Stephen Queen.

00:23:34.320 --> 00:23:35.320
 [laughter]

00:23:35.320 --> 00:23:37.600
 She said, "It's a good conversation point.

00:23:37.600 --> 00:23:41.160
 If I meet someone from say Swansea, I can say I know Swansea.

00:23:41.160 --> 00:23:43.160
 Nice weather spoons there."

00:23:43.160 --> 00:23:44.160
 [laughter]

00:23:44.160 --> 00:23:46.160
 [music]

00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:56.120
 Okay, it's time for our final fact of the show and that is James.

00:23:56.120 --> 00:24:00.960
 Okay, my fact this week is that there is an insect in New Zealand who catches its prey

00:24:00.960 --> 00:24:03.560
 by pretending to be a star.

00:24:03.560 --> 00:24:07.960
 Which star does it pretend to be Stephen Queen?

00:24:07.960 --> 00:24:08.960
 [laughter]

00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:15.200
 No, these are glowworms, they live in a cave and they all live on the ceiling and there's

00:24:15.200 --> 00:24:19.320
 loads of them and they pretend to be stars in the night sky and there are other insects

00:24:19.320 --> 00:24:23.920
 in there who navigate using the stars and they get confused by these glowworms pretending

00:24:23.920 --> 00:24:28.040
 to be stars and then they fly into their lures and they get eaten.

00:24:28.040 --> 00:24:29.040
 Yeah, it's amazing.

00:24:29.040 --> 00:24:30.040
 It's pretty cool.

00:24:30.040 --> 00:24:34.800
 And it requires serious cooperation unless you want to be a star on a really cloudy night

00:24:34.800 --> 00:24:36.760
 then they're all working together, aren't they?

00:24:36.760 --> 00:24:37.760
 Yeah, that's true.

00:24:37.760 --> 00:24:42.040
 I don't think they do exactly the same, they don't do Ryan's belt and all that goes.

00:24:42.040 --> 00:24:43.040
 [laughter]

00:24:43.040 --> 00:24:44.040
 Amazing.

00:24:44.040 --> 00:24:45.960
 But yeah, they just generally look like stars.

00:24:45.960 --> 00:24:51.280
 So it's in the Wytomo Cave which is in New Zealand and I read this in an article on the

00:24:51.280 --> 00:24:53.480
 online magazine Deep Look.

00:24:53.480 --> 00:25:01.680
 There's a species called Arachnocamper luminoza and yeah, there's moths and stuff in this cave

00:25:01.680 --> 00:25:06.160
 and there's like little bit of mucas coming down and the moths fly into the mucas and then

00:25:06.160 --> 00:25:07.160
 they can gobble them up.

00:25:07.160 --> 00:25:08.160
 Oh, lovely way to go.

00:25:08.160 --> 00:25:12.440
 You should put up a picture on your Twitter because it looks unbelievable.

00:25:12.440 --> 00:25:13.440
 I will.

00:25:13.440 --> 00:25:16.160
 If you go to my Twitter @egshaped, I'll put that picture up.

00:25:16.160 --> 00:25:17.160
 Yeah.

00:25:17.160 --> 00:25:20.840
 I really like as well that the glow, they can change the glow.

00:25:20.840 --> 00:25:25.440
 So if one of the larvae next to them has eaten, it just calms down a bit and if there's a hungry

00:25:25.440 --> 00:25:27.640
 one next to it, it glows harder like this way.

00:25:27.640 --> 00:25:28.640
 Wow.

00:25:28.640 --> 00:25:29.640
 Come on.

00:25:29.640 --> 00:25:30.640
 Yeah, it just puts out more glow.

00:25:30.640 --> 00:25:31.640
 That's great.

00:25:31.640 --> 00:25:32.640
 Wow.

00:25:32.640 --> 00:25:34.960
 I think for most female glowworms, the harder they glow, the more eggs they have.

00:25:34.960 --> 00:25:39.400
 So it is actually a good thing for a male to see a glowworm that's really glowing like

00:25:39.400 --> 00:25:44.080
 hell because it means that she's more likely to be fertile.

00:25:44.080 --> 00:25:47.920
 But by total coincidence, this weekend, I was hanging out with glowworms, which is

00:25:47.920 --> 00:25:50.560
 weird because I don't think we've ever talked about them before, but yeah, I was in Cornwall

00:25:50.560 --> 00:25:55.160
 in a place called Kajweth where everyone should go because it's one of the only guaranteed

00:25:55.160 --> 00:25:57.160
 glowworm sighting places.

00:25:57.160 --> 00:25:59.760
 Shot the people of Kajweth will love that now.

00:25:59.760 --> 00:26:04.600
 It's got a very nice weather spoon.

00:26:04.600 --> 00:26:06.520
 It does not have a weather spoon.

00:26:06.520 --> 00:26:07.520
 But they are incredible.

00:26:07.520 --> 00:26:11.320
 They do look like something that sci-fi has created and there's this one in particular

00:26:11.320 --> 00:26:16.360
 I love that's called the railroad worm, which has a body that glows green and a head that

00:26:16.360 --> 00:26:20.200
 glows red and it's called the railroad worm because it looks like a set of railway tracks.

00:26:20.200 --> 00:26:24.040
 It's got little green dots up either side of its body that lead to a red light, but it's

00:26:24.040 --> 00:26:26.240
 like a little worm traffic line.

00:26:26.240 --> 00:26:27.240
 That's amazing.

00:26:27.240 --> 00:26:28.240
 It's beautiful.

00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:29.240
 Look it up.

00:26:29.240 --> 00:26:34.080
 I was reading the UK glowworm survey website because there are, I think a few hundred places

00:26:34.080 --> 00:26:38.040
 in the UK where you can see glowworms, but not as good as this one though.

00:26:38.040 --> 00:26:42.360
 Yeah, and I think there's no words in the world that's like the white term okay but one

00:26:42.360 --> 00:26:46.680
 of the headings on the UK glowworm website is, is it really a glowworm?

00:26:46.680 --> 00:26:53.160
 And then it says, one cause of false reports of glowworms is actually light reflected from

00:26:53.160 --> 00:26:57.880
 shiny leaves due on litter.

00:26:57.880 --> 00:27:02.640
 Please check what you see really is a beetle with the light coming from the final tail segments.

00:27:02.640 --> 00:27:04.880
 Not a solid vinegar crisp bucket.

00:27:04.880 --> 00:27:11.080
 Because that's what they are, the beetles aren't they, they're not worms.

00:27:11.080 --> 00:27:15.200
 So actually I think they're in a bit of trouble in the UK aren't they glowworms, a lot of

00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:16.400
 them are dying out.

00:27:16.400 --> 00:27:19.560
 I think they're improving a bit now, but for a while they did.

00:27:19.560 --> 00:27:25.180
 One of the reasons is dog poo and apparently according to Nick Moise who's the assistant

00:27:25.180 --> 00:27:29.680
 keeper at Derby Museum, he says the number of glowworms especially around him has gone

00:27:29.680 --> 00:27:36.280
 down because dog poo creates more plant growth and they make it hard for the females and

00:27:36.280 --> 00:27:40.480
 males of the glowworm species to find each other because there's so much plant life.

00:27:40.480 --> 00:27:44.680
 That is fascinating and I'm going to take it up with Cajrith Council because they put

00:27:44.680 --> 00:27:51.200
 a sign up on their cliff path which says, please excuse the overgrown path we like to encourage

00:27:51.200 --> 00:27:54.000
 glowworms to hang out and breed here.

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:57.200
 That is obviously just an excuse for what lazy path clearance.

00:27:57.200 --> 00:27:58.200
 That's interesting.

00:27:58.200 --> 00:28:01.520
 Oh Nick Moise at the Derby Museum is wrong.

00:28:01.520 --> 00:28:03.760
 So let's not jump to too many conglomerates.

00:28:03.760 --> 00:28:07.000
 All the other two different species of glowworm.

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:10.440
 No, but I'd like to see a fight between Nick Moise and Cajrith counting.

00:28:10.440 --> 00:28:19.800
 So I've been reading about various insects that live in caves and various animals so there's

00:28:19.800 --> 00:28:24.760
 one you might like to know about which is a species of cave insect called Neo-Trogler and

00:28:24.760 --> 00:28:30.560
 this is an interesting thing because the females have penises and the males have vaginas.

00:28:30.560 --> 00:28:33.520
 Well, surely that makes some male and female, no?

00:28:33.520 --> 00:28:34.920
 Well, no, here's the thing.

00:28:34.920 --> 00:28:40.320
 So the female, it's a penis like organ, I think it's technically known as a gyneosome and

00:28:40.320 --> 00:28:47.560
 it gets erections and it's spiny, like an old penis.

00:28:47.560 --> 00:28:55.760
 So the female gets an erection in her gyneosome and the male has a vagina-like chamber, right?

00:28:55.760 --> 00:29:02.320
 And the female inserts her penis into the male to hold it still and then it acts like a vacuum

00:29:02.320 --> 00:29:04.240
 cleaner and it sucks out the male's sperm.

00:29:04.240 --> 00:29:05.240
 Oh my gosh.

00:29:05.240 --> 00:29:07.240
 It's like the seal mollus all over.

00:29:07.240 --> 00:29:10.280
 You can do that up to 70 hours straight.

00:29:10.280 --> 00:29:11.280
 Wow.

00:29:11.280 --> 00:29:12.960
 Yeah, and the thing is, the-

00:29:12.960 --> 00:29:13.960
 70 hours.

00:29:13.960 --> 00:29:14.960
 70 hours.

00:29:14.960 --> 00:29:18.360
 And the really interesting thing is that, I mean, well, that's the really interesting thing but

00:29:18.360 --> 00:29:20.640
 this other thing.

00:29:20.640 --> 00:29:24.880
 So they're locked together unbelievably tightly due to these bristles and spines and pouches

00:29:24.880 --> 00:29:27.720
 in the males of gyneor and the bristles on the penis.

00:29:27.720 --> 00:29:30.840
 So there was a scientist from Hokkaido University of his experiment and he tried pulling

00:29:30.840 --> 00:29:32.840
 a copulating pair apart and the-

00:29:32.840 --> 00:29:33.840
 Oh, why would you do that?

00:29:33.840 --> 00:29:34.840
 Well, I know.

00:29:34.840 --> 00:29:38.880
 I think that's worse because the male was then ripped in two.

00:29:38.880 --> 00:29:40.720
 It's a bad end to a date, isn't it?

00:29:40.720 --> 00:29:42.320
 You think it's going so well?

00:29:42.320 --> 00:29:48.480
 And then, yeah, so that possibly means that males in the natural world can't actually resist

00:29:48.480 --> 00:29:50.920
 the act of mating because they'll do themselves more damage.

00:29:50.920 --> 00:29:51.920
 Sure.

00:29:51.920 --> 00:29:56.880
 I looked at a couple of things on insect camouflage strategies or insects disguising themselves

00:29:56.880 --> 00:29:58.680
 as other things.

00:29:58.680 --> 00:30:03.840
 So one of the things I love is that spiders, which obviously aren't insects, disguise

00:30:03.840 --> 00:30:08.600
 themselves as ants by lifting up their two front legs and pretending that they're antenna

00:30:08.600 --> 00:30:11.600
 by waving them above their heads.

00:30:11.600 --> 00:30:13.280
 So then they only have six legs, obviously.

00:30:13.280 --> 00:30:14.280
 Yeah, then they've only got six legs left.

00:30:14.280 --> 00:30:16.640
 And then they lift another two and pretend to be a cow.

00:30:16.640 --> 00:30:20.040
 And then another two and pretend to be a human.

00:30:20.040 --> 00:30:26.080
 They've found, not too long ago, that camouflage within insects has been going back very, very

00:30:26.080 --> 00:30:27.080
 long-top.

00:30:27.080 --> 00:30:29.800
 They've actually found, in amber, the earliest example of it.

00:30:29.800 --> 00:30:35.560
 And it was found by a Chinese academy of sciences in Nanjing, by a team led by Bo Wang.

00:30:35.560 --> 00:30:38.360
 And it's called debris camouflage.

00:30:38.360 --> 00:30:43.280
 And debris camouflage is when you just carry, effectively carrying a leaf on top of you.

00:30:43.280 --> 00:30:49.000
 But they've got examples of it where it definitely was trying to hide underneath the leaf.

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:52.320
 Just like, "Sell it, say if he leaves you and pretend it to be a tree."

00:30:52.320 --> 00:30:53.320
 Exactly.

00:30:53.320 --> 00:30:56.760
 And none of you has asked me why I've got an empty pack of salt and vinegar crisps on top

00:30:56.760 --> 00:30:57.760
 of my head.

00:30:57.760 --> 00:31:02.040
 Okay, that probably was a glow worth it.

00:31:02.040 --> 00:31:06.360
 Orkids disguise themselves as wasps so that other wasps will have sex with them.

00:31:06.360 --> 00:31:09.600
 Rather than just attracting the wasps to come and pick up pollen, they actually make wasps

00:31:09.600 --> 00:31:13.240
 come and mate with them by emitting smells that smell like a wasp and making themselves

00:31:13.240 --> 00:31:14.240
 look like a wasp.

00:31:14.240 --> 00:31:19.440
 And 75% of wasps who land on these orkids do actually ejaculate.

00:31:19.440 --> 00:31:22.480
 So they just go away thinking, "Oh, I successfully had sex there."

00:31:22.480 --> 00:31:23.480
 Isn't that weird?

00:31:23.480 --> 00:31:25.280
 I think they've just mated with a wasp.

00:31:25.280 --> 00:31:30.080
 The good thing is humans, we have no idea what the thing is that is persuading us to have

00:31:30.080 --> 00:31:32.840
 sex with it by mentally, successfully mimicking a human isps.

00:31:32.840 --> 00:31:44.480
 If I found out that my wife's been an orkid all this time, we don't know what's out there.

00:31:44.480 --> 00:31:48.800
 Okay, that's it.

00:31:48.800 --> 00:31:49.800
 That's all of our facts.

00:31:49.800 --> 00:31:51.040
