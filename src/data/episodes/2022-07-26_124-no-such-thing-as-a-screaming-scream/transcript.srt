1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,080
 They don't look at it, but it won't look at it.

2
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:14,680
 Hello, and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming

3
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:17,560
 to you from the QI offices in Covert Garden.

4
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:23,080
 My name is Dad Shriver, I'm sitting here with Anish Zinski, James Harkin, and Andy Murray,

5
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:26,760
 and once again we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last

6
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:33,160
 seven days, and in no particular order, here we go, starting with you Chazinski.

7
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:38,800
 My fact this week is that the first trampolines were made of wool or skin, and this is a thing

8
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:42,480
 that's called blanket tossing, and it's been practiced for the...

9
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:47,520
 My teenage boys for thousands of years.

10
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:52,560
 Okay, so blanket tossing is something that's been practiced by the Anupiat Eskimos up in Alaska

11
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:56,600
 for, we don't know exactly how long, but references to it go back to...

12
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:01,600
 On Google Books, they go back to the very early 19th century, and that talks about it as a tradition

13
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:07,240
 that's obviously been practiced for a long time, and it's a game they played where they'd get

14
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:11,360
 a wool rust hide, and they'd attach it with ropes to four poles, and then they'd have lots

15
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:14,800
 of holes drilled into the wool rust hide all around it, so people could get their hands

16
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:18,720
 through the holes and pull on the holes, so they pull on the skin, and then they dump

17
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:23,160
 somebody in the middle of the skin, and it's about waist height, it's suspended, and then

18
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:26,920
 when everyone pulls on the holes at the same time, then obviously the skin flicks upwards,

19
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:29,120
 and it throws the person on them up in the end.

20
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:30,120
 Wow.

21
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:32,840
 So we're going to say that counts as a trampoline, are we?

22
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:38,000
 I think I am for the sake of this fact, no I think, because it's attached to things at

23
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
 the side.

24
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
 People are holding...

25
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,120
 It sounds more like a, you know, when there's a fire in a building, and someone needs

26
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:45,920
 to jump out, and there's people below with that fire net.

27
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:50,840
 Those are really interesting, I didn't really know about those, or you see them in old films

28
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:53,640
 and things, there's one in Dumbo, isn't there?

29
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:56,360
 You know, in the circus show, there are all the clowns and he covers it off of a burning

30
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:57,360
 building.

31
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,360
 But Dumbo can fly.

32
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:01,600
 Well yeah, but they don't know that at the time they're planning the circus show.

33
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:06,760
 No, and also James Spoiler, very much alert.

34
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:10,960
 But anyway, we don't really know why people did this, it seems like a lot of people speculate,

35
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:15,000
 but it could have been, for instance, in order to, when they were hunting, get one

36
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,680
 member of their tribe raised up high so that they could see for a long way where the nearest

37
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:24,120
 new walrus was to kill to make their new trampoline, or whatever.

38
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:28,680
 That's an amazing idea, and then gradually they noticed that the people were staying on

39
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:29,680
 it for ages.

40
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:32,120
 Oh, it's just one more go, guys.

41
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:35,160
 I thought it's one something.

42
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:40,920
 I've read something about you've been framed, something like 40% of home video accidents videos

43
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:44,600
 that are sent in out of trampolining accidents.

44
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:45,600
 That doesn't sound true to me.

45
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:46,600
 It sounds so untrue.

46
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:50,400
 I don't know, because it's an occasion that you'd film someone being on a trampoline.

47
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:54,760
 I do see that, but from my memory of watching you've been framed it's usually cats and dogs

48
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:55,760
 doing stupid things.

49
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:56,960
 Oh, they weed out.

50
00:02:56,960 --> 00:03:02,200
 They mostly take from the other 60%, but you can't just show incessant trampolines, people

51
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,200
 will get doors.

52
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,200
 True.

53
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,200
 But how many people own trampolines?

54
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,200
 I thought everyone did.

55
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,200
 Am I wrong?

56
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:11,040
 Do you want to hear a headline from Scotland in 2010?

57
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,040
 Yes, please.

58
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:17,200
 A man caught jumping up and down naked on a trampoline has avoided a jail sentence.

59
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,200
 Okay.

60
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:24,120
 It was a man whose surname was Byrdon, and he had his manhood in one hand and a cigarette

61
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:30,000
 in the other when he was spotted by the neighbor and a neighbor called the police, and he was

62
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,320
 arrested and charged with shameless indecency.

63
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,320
 Wow.

64
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:37,160
 And the prosecutor said he told police he had gone out to the trampoline and had masturbated

65
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:38,160
 himself there.

66
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:41,480
 So blanket tossing survives in some ways.

67
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:42,480
 And asked why he did it.

68
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:45,200
 Byrdon told officers just for the thrill of it.

69
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:52,280
 On the bus side, he did manage to win 250 quid when he sent in the video to you being framed.

70
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:58,720
 I was reading about the earliest modern trampolines, and I went to the Olympics website because

71
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,520
 they've got a history of trampolining on there.

72
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:06,080
 So the earliest that they have is 1934, and it was for astronauts.

73
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:10,840
 And the idea was to get astronauts used to the idea of what space conditions might be.

74
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:14,400
 It was the best kind of possible exercise for them to do.

75
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,720
 How many astronauts were there in 1934?

76
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,080
 That's a very good point.

77
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:20,560
 There would have been none.

78
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,080
 I thought NASA used them, but not in the 30s.

79
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:28,600
 Maybe the modern trampoline was developed in 1934, and the NASA started using them down

80
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,600
 the line.

81
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:35,360
 It was by two guys called George Nissen and Larry Griswold at the University of Iowa.

82
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,200
 And they came up with this idea.

83
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:42,960
 And the guy, George Nissen, he was traveling in Spain, and he heard the word trampoline,

84
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:47,280
 which meant the springboard, and he thought that's a good name, and he took it.

85
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:50,280
 So in Spanish, the word trampoline means springboard.

86
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:53,840
 And in Italian, it means stilts, isn't it?

87
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:54,840
 Not sure why.

88
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:55,840
 Wow.

89
00:04:55,840 --> 00:05:00,480
 Those countries are arriving to the Olympics.

90
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:05,120
 Nissen always wanted it to be in the Olympics, but it wasn't until 2008.

91
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:09,880
 He was given the honour of testing out the first ever Olympic trampoline before the event,

92
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:11,680
 and he was 94 years old.

93
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,680
 Wow.

94
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,720
 He died a couple of years later, but yeah.

95
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:15,720
 He was really cool.

96
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:21,120
 His 80th birthday, apparently, had a big dinner party, and in the middle of the dinner party,

97
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,560
 he threw all the silverware aside and got onto the table and did a handstand.

98
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,560
 But AC.

99
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:26,560
 Wow.

100
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,560
 What a fun guy.

101
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:32,560
 You do get kicked out of the restaurant for doing that, especially if you're naked with

102
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:36,160
 a cigarette in one hand.

103
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,960
 Do you know how Nissen got the trampoline popularised?

104
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:39,960
 No.

105
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:42,760
 He jumped up and down on one with a kangaroo.

106
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:43,760
 The kangaroo?

107
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:44,760
 Yeah.

108
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:45,760
 He's a kangaroo.

109
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:46,760
 Does it go twice as high?

110
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:47,760
 Actually, this is interesting.

111
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:48,760
 You say that.

112
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:51,560
 You should all look up at home a YouTube video of a kangaroo that accidentally jumps onto

113
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:55,280
 someone's trampoline in America, and they filmed it, and it tries to jump off, and obviously

114
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:59,720
 it doesn't have the consistency the kangaroo expects, and it just faceplans into the ground

115
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:00,720
 in front.

116
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:01,720
 Wow.

117
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:06,960
 He had a higher kangaroo in 1960, and jumped up and down a trampoline with it, and apparently

118
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:10,660
 locked eyes with it for ages, and had lots of photographs taken, and this photograph went

119
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:12,400
 viral all around the world.

120
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,160
 And people thought, yeah, that looks great.

121
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,040
 They all hired trampolines and kangaroos.

122
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:18,400
 Was that like a bundle deal that you had?

123
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,960
 Travelling plus kangaroo for a 50-grid extra.

124
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:21,960
 No, they didn't.

125
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:23,840
 They didn't actually hire out kangaroos.

126
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:29,240
 He also tried to invent a load of games, and so one of them was called Spaceball, and what

127
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:34,280
 it was is you'd have four people on a massive trampoline, two on each side, and there'd be a wall

128
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:38,600
 in between, and the wall would have a hole in it, and you'd try and throw the ball through

129
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:42,680
 the hole, and hit a target on the other side of the trampoline, and the other guys would

130
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:43,680
 try and block it.

131
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,040
 Yeah, I think it sounds fantastic.

132
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:47,880
 Sounds like a trampoline version of Quidditch.

133
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:50,480
 In Australia, we used to play trampoline volleyball.

134
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,480
 That's so cool.

135
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,480
 Is it?

136
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,480
 Yeah.

137
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:56,160
 There's a lot of trampoline games that get played out in Australia that I'm seeing over

138
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,160
 here.

139
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,160
 We don't have so many trampolines.

140
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,240
 Australia's got so much space.

141
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,240
 You can fit them in.

142
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:04,880
 Is that why you've got so many kangaroos, you just bought a load of trampolines, as well?

143
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,760
 They all came with a free kangaroo.

144
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:09,360
 What do I do with this guy?

145
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,360
 Yeah.

146
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:15,000
 Okay, so some other things that you can make using walruses, as well as trampolines.

147
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:20,840
 So, walrous stomach lining was used for sales by Inuit people.

148
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:26,240
 The shoulder blades were used as shovels, and the penis bones were used to make houses

149
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,960
 to brace the walls.

150
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:31,120
 So, to secure the flooring in the houses.

151
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:35,560
 And also, there were some Inuits in St. Lawrence Island who used the penis bones to make snow

152
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:36,560
 goggles.

153
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,560
 Really?

154
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:38,560
 Yeah.

155
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,320
 They used them as tent poles, as well.

156
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,320
 Yeah.

157
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:42,320
 And this is cool.

158
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:49,360
 You would live in a walrus home, so you would stretch the hideout over whale rib frames,

159
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,080
 or penis bone frames.

160
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:56,160
 And the windows would be made of stretched walrus gut, or stretched penis membrane from

161
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,160
 the walrus.

162
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:59,160
 And the window in your walrus skin house.

163
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,160
 How is that?

164
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,160
 What does that mean?

165
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,160
 What's a membrane?

166
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,160
 Very thin piece of skin.

167
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,160
 A thin skin, I suppose.

168
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,160
 Yeah.

169
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:08,240
 They also, apparently, their whiskers could be used as nose pickers.

170
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:13,320
 And you would like your home using walruses in the lamps, and you would also turn the intestines

171
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,320
 into your clothes.

172
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:17,120
 So, you were completely living inside a walrus, and you would eat.

173
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,120
 Wow.

174
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:21,800
 They made frozen blocks of walrus meat, which they turned into.

175
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:24,040
 I find this impossible to believe, but I love it.

176
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:28,280
 And waste ledges, which you would eat as you went.

177
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:29,280
 Oh, yeah.

178
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,280
 Oh, my God.

179
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:34,600
 They, you know, Captain Cook's biographer says the closest he ever came to suffering a mutiny

180
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:40,520
 was when he tried to make his men eat walrus, and they all vomited, and said it was disgusting.

181
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:45,200
 Captain Scott, when he was in the Antarctic, I was reading about this the other day.

182
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:49,960
 He tried to get, they tried to eat seals when they were going down the Antarctic, but

183
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:52,480
 it was so disgusting, they hated the taste of it.

184
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:56,960
 So they boiled it really, really, really for ages to try and get rid of this kind of horrible

185
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,800
 fishy taste.

186
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:02,640
 Because they boiled it so much, it got rid of all of the vitamin C in there, and so they

187
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:03,640
 all caught scurvy.

188
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:04,640
 Oh, wow, really?

189
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:07,480
 Yeah, but they didn't know at the time that's what was doing it, but yeah.

190
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,480
 Wow.

191
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,480
 That's really interesting.

192
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:10,680
 But do you know how they hunt them?

193
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:14,960
 How the Alaskan Eskimo's hunt walrus, and how they have done for hundreds of years.

194
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:18,040
 They take a seal skin out, so apparently they're attracted to seal skin.

195
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:22,400
 They want to eat the seal skin, and they have it dragging behind the boat.

196
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:25,440
 Because walrus comes and then they kill it with a harpoon, and then in order to carry it

197
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,200
 back to the shore, they inflate it with a tube.

198
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:32,680
 And so the walrus just floats behind the boat, like a little inflatable boy, like a boy.

199
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:33,680
 Like a boy?

200
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:34,680
 Exactly.

201
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:39,640
 Do you know that their mouths have a vacuum force suction, right?

202
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:44,360
 When they eat seals, this is how strong their suction is, they can suck the skin off

203
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:45,360
 the seals.

204
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,360
 What?

205
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:47,360
 Yeah?

206
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,360
 That's what I read.

207
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:49,360
 Is that the best bit for the skin?

208
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,520
 No, they're trying to get to the meat, so they want that out of the way.

209
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:53,000
 So then they spit it out.

210
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
 Yeah, yeah.

211
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
 Okay.

212
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
 It sounds so dubious.

213
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,280
 It's what I've got another amazing sounding thing about walrus, which I almost can't believe

214
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:04,600
 is that they have these very strong muscles, and they can basically push their eyes out

215
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:07,880
 a bit, so they can either look forwards or sideways.

216
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:12,120
 I read that when they're attacking seals, one way in which to kill them is that they

217
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,120
 drown them.

218
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:17,360
 So they've got incredibly strong grips, and they grip around them with a hug, which

219
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:21,440
 often is confused a lot of humans, who, if they're in a sea world, that often

220
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:25,480
 confuses a lot of people because it looks very friendly, but actually it's a really solid

221
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:26,960
 grip, and they take you down.

222
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:30,840
 I just imagine being in sea world, and you're like, "Oh look, that walrus is kissing that

223
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,920
 seal, and then it rips its skin off."

224
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:36,920
 Oh my god.

225
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:48,960
 Okay, it is time for fact number two.

226
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:52,120
 That is Andrew Hunter Murray.

227
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:56,120
 My fact is that one suggested solution to the problem of storing nuclear waste for thousands

228
00:10:56,120 --> 00:11:02,840
 of years is putting up warning signs with Edward Monk's The Scream on them.

229
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:08,560
 So this is particularly at New Mexico's waste isolation pilot plants.

230
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:13,280
 There are loads of nuclear storage facilities all over the world, whether you store all the

231
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:20,360
 waste that you get from nuclear power plants, and the problem is that so far, I think the

232
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:26,400
 whole industry has generated about 300,000 tons of the stuff, and it has to be protected

233
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:30,360
 from all lifeforms for about 100,000 years.

234
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:36,040
 And I mean, it's 10,000 years since we invented farming, and some of it lasts for a million

235
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:37,040
 years.

236
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:40,360
 So the idea that we're going to be able to clearly say to future civilisations.

237
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:43,600
 We can hardly even understand Shakespeare and Chaucer and stuff.

238
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:44,600
 Yeah.

239
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:48,360
 I know the Pyramids are 5,000 years ago, and we know what Herodless mean, but it's taken a lot

240
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:49,360
 of work.

241
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:52,040
 But the idea is, I guess, and it does kind of make sense, right?

242
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:57,040
 The Edward Monk's The Scream, or however we're pronouncing his name, it just does look like

243
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:02,000
 a human who's terrified, and you imagine that, unless we really physically evolve out of

244
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,880
 looking at all like ourselves, it probably still won't have any experience.

245
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:08,320
 I don't know, because that emoji, which is a bit like the screen where he's got his hands

246
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:11,680
 next to his face, that almost means, "Wow!"

247
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:12,680
 Oh, yeah.

248
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:13,680
 So what have you done?

249
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:14,680
 I've been using that wrong.

250
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:15,680
 In just 50 years.

251
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:16,680
 How have you like?

252
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:17,680
 What are 50 years from now?

253
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:18,680
 That means awesome, cool thing.

254
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:19,680
 Yeah.

255
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:20,680
 Great rollercoaster, right?

256
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:21,680
 Yeah.

257
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:24,760
 So they haven't actually done this, but this was one proposal, and there were other proposals

258
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:29,760
 included, things like making a whole landscape nearby, full of jagged concrete spikes to make

259
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:32,400
 it this horrible, foreboding place.

260
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:36,280
 I saw that suggestion, but then someone said there's a very big problem that usually when

261
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:40,080
 you make big ugly things, they just get destroyed by the next generation.

262
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,080
 Right.

263
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:42,080
 Yeah.

264
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:46,680
 But the problem is, it's all, we have no idea what future societies are going to be like.

265
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:50,000
 They might find ever mugs painting the screen unbelievably sexy and enticing.

266
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
 Yeah.

267
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,480
 That might be what an attractive person looks like in 2000 years.

268
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:57,040
 So it's a huge philosophical problem, and actually the French nuclear agency is called

269
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:02,120
 Andrea, and it has a special memory division, and their job is to deal with these problems

270
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:03,120
 and to think about them.

271
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:06,200
 Yeah, there was one guy who said, "My job is essentially to communicate with people

272
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:10,920
 in the future," which is the coolest job, and I liked, I think it was him who was pointing

273
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:14,400
 out one of the ways that things could be misinterpreted in the future, is if we drew

274
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:18,720
 a little comic above dangerous sites, which showed a little diagram of a man walking into

275
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:22,720
 a barrel of radioactive waste, and then the next one was his head exploding or something,

276
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:26,680
 and the next one was his coffin, actually, in the future they might read backwards.

277
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:29,400
 So they might think that it's something that brings you back to life again.

278
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:33,560
 They might think that if your head's exploded, this is a thing that gets the pieces of brain

279
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:38,360
 from all the different parts and puts them all back together, and you definitely want

280
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:39,360
 to dig that up.

281
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:45,360
 That's like my parents, when they moved to Hong Kong, they lived on Redneck Cellar Road,

282
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:49,880
 and no one could work out what Redneck Cellar was, they just had no idea, it turns out that

283
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:54,640
 it was actually Alexander Road, but the person who was Chinese who was making the sign obviously

284
00:13:54,640 --> 00:14:04,040
 wrote from right to left, so Redneck Cell was very famous as an early example of that happening.

285
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:08,800
 You guys must have all found that other thing about making GM cats.

286
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:13,560
 So what you do is you genetically modify cats so that whenever they see any radiation,

287
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:14,880
 they change colour.

288
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:19,000
 Then you also make a nursery rhyme saying, "Little cat, little cat, if you change colour,

289
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,800
 we're all going to die," and so people remember the nursery rhyme and see a cat's change

290
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:25,840
 in colour and think, "Oh, shit, that means we're all going to die," and so they stay away

291
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:26,840
 from the radiation.

292
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:32,840
 This was a thought experiment, I think, wasn't it, by philosophers in the 80s, from Swabasti

293
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:34,160
 and Paolo Fabri.

294
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:35,160
 Yeah.

295
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:41,240
 I think the idea was that we've always, in human culture, been really interested in cats,

296
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:45,320
 and they've always been important to us as symbols, so if we go way way into the future,

297
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:49,400
 we can be reasonably sure, they think, that humans will still be watching cats and

298
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:52,200
 still be taking note of them, and when they start glowing, they'll still be.

299
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:54,920
 There's no good way of doing it, I don't think we are going to crack this.

300
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:59,000
 I really like the idea of just making it really boring, so people don't want to go there.

301
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
 Yeah.

302
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,120
 They're just making a completely wasteland, nothing there, put it 400 metres down, and hope

303
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:05,920
 that no one's going to go 400 metres down.

304
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:09,960
 It's just such a long time, that's the problem, you've no idea what's going on.

305
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:10,960
 Or fire it into the sun.

306
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:13,880
 Well, it was discussed a lot, wasn't it, firing stuff into space, and I think the fear

307
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:17,480
 was that if there were an accident in the atmosphere, and we had hundreds of thousands

308
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:21,400
 of tons of radioactive waste on a craft that then exploded, it would just rain down

309
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:22,160
 upon us.

310
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,960
 It would feel so, so stupid.

311
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:25,520
 Do you feel like an idiot?

312
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:26,520
 Not for long.

313
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:27,520
 But...

314
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:32,880
 I quite like the idea of the comic book, but then also having some kind of, you know, cracking

315
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:36,120
 of an egg, so you can see the direction that time goes.

316
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:37,440
 Do you know what I mean?

317
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:41,720
 So there are some things which are definitely one directional in time, due to entropy.

318
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:45,040
 So you could put those in the same direction as the comic book, and then they would realise

319
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:47,080
 that they'll have time travel by then, James.

320
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:51,960
 But then, surely, we could just go forward in time to where they are.

321
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:52,960
 Oh, just tell them.

322
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:53,960
 No.

323
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:54,960
 They'll have time travel.

324
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:58,960
 Well, when they come back here to 2016, which was the most interesting year in the whole

325
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:03,320
 of history, we can just go, oh, by the way, although that case, what are we worried about?

326
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:04,640
 We should just wait for the time travel.

327
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:07,480
 If there can't be people that do even develop time travel, I don't think they deserve

328
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:10,320
 to say these people.

329
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,320
 Here's something.

330
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:15,320
 I love the idea of time travel is finally coming back, but just being seriously pissed

331
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:16,320
 off with us.

332
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,320
 It's an opening line, dude.

333
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:19,640
 Was that weird scream guy you were supposed to say?

334
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:24,600
 Don't go into a massively radioactive, or do you put a picture of the most attractive woman

335
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:28,240
 for the 5 millionth century?

336
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,400
 So the scream?

337
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:30,400
 Yep.

338
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:31,400
 Yep.

339
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:33,840
 That guy is not screaming.

340
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:36,080
 Well, the scream is not coming from him.

341
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:41,280
 The whole point of that painting is it's a scream coming from nature, and he's kind of

342
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:44,840
 covering his ears to keep out the scream that's coming from nature.

343
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:49,120
 Do we know what he meant by a screaming?

344
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:53,720
 I read something that he said, "I was walking along the road with two friends.

345
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:57,160
 The sun was setting, suddenly the sky turned blood red.

346
00:16:57,160 --> 00:17:00,400
 I paused, feeling exhausted and leaned on the fence.

347
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:05,200
 There was blood and tongues of fire above the blue, black fjord and the city.

348
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:11,200
 My friends walked on and I stood there trembling with anxiety and I sensed an infinite scream passing

349
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,200
 through nature.

350
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:14,480
 So it's almost like an anxiety attack, isn't it?

351
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:15,480
 Yeah.

352
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:20,840
 So after the eruption of, is it Cracotella?

353
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:21,840
 1880s?

354
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:24,560
 Yeah, so there had just been a volcanic eruption in Southeast Asia and so all the skies were

355
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:30,320
 quite weird and red and strange and they think that's where that came from.

356
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:33,560
 Well people's face is also suddenly going weirdly curvy.

357
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:36,840
 So I didn't know he did four versions of it.

358
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:50,120
 I'm one of the three ones, green two, green three.

359
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:54,320
 Okay, it is time for fact number three and that is my fact.

360
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:59,920
 My fact this week is that Karl Marx used to do London pub crawls.

361
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:04,400
 So London pub crawls, for anyone overseas, that means jumping from bar to bar in a single

362
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:07,120
 evening and having a drink at each of those bars.

363
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,920
 He managed to do 18 bars.

364
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:14,580
 So this is Karl Marx, who I've always associated as a deep philosophical thinker and not someone

365
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:16,400
 who was a pisshead.

366
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:21,320
 They went all the way up Tuntland Court Road, which is very close to where we work and there's

367
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:26,120
 not as many bars these days on it that were 18 in his day and they managed to do it.

368
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:31,600
 And at the end, they got all ladish and started breaking stuff in the street throwing rocks

369
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:32,600
 at lamps.

370
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:37,960
 Well, they had a bit of a sort of xenophobic brawl with a bunch of Englishmen and a pub,

371
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:38,960
 didn't they?

372
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:44,560
 So Marx is one of the people that Marx is on this bar crawl with who is Wilhelm Legnecht

373
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:46,080
 wrote about it later.

374
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:48,920
 And so they got into some chats with some British guys and a pub and it all started off

375
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:55,640
 very friendly and then they sort of started debating politics and he noted that at one

376
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:59,440
 point the British people, when they said Russian, they usually meant Prussian.

377
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:04,080
 It seems Russia and Prussia are frequently confounded in England, which feels like classic English.

378
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:07,040
 Russia, Prussia, whatever, completely different places, obviously.

379
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:08,040
 Yeah.

380
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:11,400
 Yeah, then they decided to claim that Germans were culturally superior to English people

381
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:15,800
 and so I think the English people decided to fight them, wanted to fist fight and they

382
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:18,760
 scarpered and then they decided to smash up some lamp post as they ran away.

383
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:23,600
 Do you know that Karl Marx, when he went on honeymoon with his wife, Jenny, took 45 books

384
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:24,600
 with him?

385
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:25,600
 That's so insulting.

386
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:26,600
 It's so rude.

387
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:29,680
 Unless they were books on the art of good sex.

388
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:31,640
 I don't think they can all have been.

389
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:32,920
 No, you've been in there with that many.

390
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:36,920
 In my experience, you only need a few of those, but they can't any holiday.

391
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:41,800
 Do you know, Jenny and Marx had four daughters who were born, three of them, five to adulthood,

392
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:43,760
 and they were all called Jenny, bizarre.

393
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:44,760
 Oh, really?

394
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:49,400
 Yeah, and then the son that they had is called Edgar, after Jenny's brother, weird.

395
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:53,000
 I think my favourite thing that I read about Karl Marx is that obviously he's buried

396
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:58,600
 in high-gate cemetry and I've been to it, you can, if you live in London, it's worth going.

397
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:02,720
 Huge, huge tombstone with his head on the top of it.

398
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:06,720
 And what I love is that there's constantly reports being made that Marxists who go to visit

399
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:11,400
 him are furious that they have to pay to get into the graveyard and none of them realise

400
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,400
 that when they get there.

401
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,760
 I think he's buried next to Herbert Spencer.

402
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:15,760
 He's covered him.

403
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:17,280
 He's the philosopher who had an angry suit.

404
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,760
 He got a suit when he was angry.

405
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:23,760
 And he also had theories that were very different to Marx's, so in Russia is always a joke that

406
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:27,360
 these two people are buried near each other and they're kind of arguing after death.

407
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:28,360
 Oh, really?

408
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:30,160
 The other joke is that Marx and Spencer.

409
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:31,160
 Oh, yes.

410
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:34,120
 I think they're opposite each other in fact, looking at each other.

411
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:35,120
 Yeah.

412
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:38,920
 Do you know Marx's biographer said one of his personal habits to inspire his creativity

413
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:43,840
 was to stand up to, he'll be at a table working and he'd stand up and he'd start walking

414
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:46,600
 around the table and he'd just walk faster and faster and faster and faster.

415
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:50,760
 And he found that was the way to make ideas come to him, just starting to be renting around

416
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:51,760
 the table.

417
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:52,760
 It just sounds like you'd pass out.

418
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:55,560
 I think he had a lot of boils on his bum as well.

419
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:56,560
 He did.

420
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:57,560
 Throughout life.

421
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:58,560
 So he found sitting incredibly hard, so.

422
00:20:58,560 --> 00:20:59,560
 Can I make sense?

423
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:01,560
 Those two facts been connected?

424
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:02,560
 Yeah, exactly.

425
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:03,560
 Yeah.

426
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:06,800
 Although they did, they do say that he would do the walking around as soon as the idea came

427
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:07,800
 to him.

428
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:10,160
 He would immediately slam himself into a chair and start writing.

429
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:12,320
 That doesn't sound like something you'd do with boils.

430
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:13,320
 With boils.

431
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:14,320
 You gently slide in.

432
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:15,320
 Slytherin.

433
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:16,320
 Slytherin.

434
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:17,320
 Slytherin.

435
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:21,320
 That was one of the pubs he went to, actually.

436
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:26,160
 Yeah, the skin disease he had was really debilitating and he wrote to Engels saying he had boils all

437
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,160
 over his penis.

438
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,920
 That was a nice letter to get.

439
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:33,120
 He had an Engels maybe who was there with a friend going, "I have this philosopher, Marks,

440
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,120
 I know what I'm saying."

441
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:35,600
 I just got letter from and he should read it.

442
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,120
 He's an incredible brain.

443
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:41,160
 From each according to his ability, to each according to how many boils the lacer has on

444
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:42,160
 their pit.

445
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:44,160
 We saw a letter of his just a few days ago.

446
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:48,760
 You and I were at the British library and they have this incredible treasures room where

447
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:53,400
 they have original writings from Dickens and Thomas Hardy and everyone.

448
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:55,960
 God, is every single person you'd want to see the handwriting of?

449
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:56,960
 Yeah.

450
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:57,960
 You'll see it there in this room.

451
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:01,240
 And they have a letter from Marks to Engels and they used to write in pseudonyms.

452
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:02,240
 They used to have...

453
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:07,200
 I'm not surprised to hear that most of what they were writing about.

454
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,200
 Just on pub crawls.

455
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:09,200
 Uh-huh.

456
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,200
 Yeah.

457
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,200
 Uh-huh.

458
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,200
 Uh-huh.

459
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:13,200
 There is an Oliver Reed pub crawl in Wimbledon, which is my hometown.

460
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,200
 Yeah.

461
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:18,560
 And it's eight different pubs and the record for it is two complete laps, i.e. 16 pubs

462
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:21,800
 having a pint in each and it is held by Oliver Reed.

463
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:25,240
 After he completed the 16 pubs, he threw up on Steve McQueen.

464
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:26,240
 [laughter]

465
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:27,240
 Good name.

466
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:33,360
 Um, have you seen these guys, um, who are trying to go to every pub in the UK?

467
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:34,360
 No.

468
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:35,360
 No.

469
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:40,160
 There's a group of guys, um, they're known as the black country ale testers.

470
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:41,920
 So I assume they're from the middle in somewhere.

471
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:50,000
 Uh, and they've done over 18,000 pubs in the UK, including every single one of the 3,905 pubs

472
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
 in Wales.

473
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
 Wow.

474
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
 Okay.

475
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,080
 There used to be more of them and then I think one of them died and a few of them stopped

476
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:59,280
 when they reached 18,000, um, but some of them are still going.

477
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:00,280
 Wow.

478
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:03,600
 There was an interview with one of them in the newspaper and he said, "Now a day is I try

479
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:06,600
 to limit myself to 1,500 pints a year."

480
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:07,600
 [laughter]

481
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:10,840
 Well, that is restraint if I ever heard it.

482
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:14,520
 But they don't think they'll ever get every single one in the UK because it's just too many.

483
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:15,920
 Because they just keep making new ones.

484
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:20,480
 There's a similar, uh, problem that is had by the woman who's visited the most weather

485
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:21,480
 spoons in the UK.

486
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:27,320
 This woman called Mags Thompson and she's been to 972 and that was out of 2014, I think.

487
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:30,240
 But she says it's just very hard to keep up because they keep popping up everywhere.

488
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:31,240
 [laughter]

489
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:34,320
 Well, they all at the same night and then she vomits it on Stephen Queen.

490
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:35,320
 [laughter]

491
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:37,600
 She said, "It's a good conversation point.

492
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:41,160
 If I meet someone from say Swansea, I can say I know Swansea.

493
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:43,160
 Nice weather spoons there."

494
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:44,160
 [laughter]

495
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:46,160
 [music]

496
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:56,120
 Okay, it's time for our final fact of the show and that is James.

497
00:23:56,120 --> 00:24:00,960
 Okay, my fact this week is that there is an insect in New Zealand who catches its prey

498
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:03,560
 by pretending to be a star.

499
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:07,960
 Which star does it pretend to be Stephen Queen?

500
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:08,960
 [laughter]

501
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:15,200
 No, these are glowworms, they live in a cave and they all live on the ceiling and there's

502
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:19,320
 loads of them and they pretend to be stars in the night sky and there are other insects

503
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:23,920
 in there who navigate using the stars and they get confused by these glowworms pretending

504
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:28,040
 to be stars and then they fly into their lures and they get eaten.

505
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:29,040
 Yeah, it's amazing.

506
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:30,040
 It's pretty cool.

507
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:34,800
 And it requires serious cooperation unless you want to be a star on a really cloudy night

508
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:36,760
 then they're all working together, aren't they?

509
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:37,760
 Yeah, that's true.

510
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:42,040
 I don't think they do exactly the same, they don't do Ryan's belt and all that goes.

511
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:43,040
 [laughter]

512
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:44,040
 Amazing.

513
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:45,960
 But yeah, they just generally look like stars.

514
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:51,280
 So it's in the Wytomo Cave which is in New Zealand and I read this in an article on the

515
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:53,480
 online magazine Deep Look.

516
00:24:53,480 --> 00:25:01,680
 There's a species called Arachnocamper luminoza and yeah, there's moths and stuff in this cave

517
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:06,160
 and there's like little bit of mucas coming down and the moths fly into the mucas and then

518
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:07,160
 they can gobble them up.

519
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:08,160
 Oh, lovely way to go.

520
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:12,440
 You should put up a picture on your Twitter because it looks unbelievable.

521
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:13,440
 I will.

522
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:16,160
 If you go to my Twitter @egshaped, I'll put that picture up.

523
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:17,160
 Yeah.

524
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:20,840
 I really like as well that the glow, they can change the glow.

525
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:25,440
 So if one of the larvae next to them has eaten, it just calms down a bit and if there's a hungry

526
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,640
 one next to it, it glows harder like this way.

527
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:28,640
 Wow.

528
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:29,640
 Come on.

529
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:30,640
 Yeah, it just puts out more glow.

530
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:31,640
 That's great.

531
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:32,640
 Wow.

532
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,960
 I think for most female glowworms, the harder they glow, the more eggs they have.

533
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:39,400
 So it is actually a good thing for a male to see a glowworm that's really glowing like

534
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:44,080
 hell because it means that she's more likely to be fertile.

535
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:47,920
 But by total coincidence, this weekend, I was hanging out with glowworms, which is

536
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:50,560
 weird because I don't think we've ever talked about them before, but yeah, I was in Cornwall

537
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:55,160
 in a place called Kajweth where everyone should go because it's one of the only guaranteed

538
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:57,160
 glowworm sighting places.

539
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:59,760
 Shot the people of Kajweth will love that now.

540
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:04,600
 It's got a very nice weather spoon.

541
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:06,520
 It does not have a weather spoon.

542
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:07,520
 But they are incredible.

543
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:11,320
 They do look like something that sci-fi has created and there's this one in particular

544
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:16,360
 I love that's called the railroad worm, which has a body that glows green and a head that

545
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:20,200
 glows red and it's called the railroad worm because it looks like a set of railway tracks.

546
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:24,040
 It's got little green dots up either side of its body that lead to a red light, but it's

547
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:26,240
 like a little worm traffic line.

548
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:27,240
 That's amazing.

549
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:28,240
 It's beautiful.

550
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:29,240
 Look it up.

551
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:34,080
 I was reading the UK glowworm survey website because there are, I think a few hundred places

552
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:38,040
 in the UK where you can see glowworms, but not as good as this one though.

553
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:42,360
 Yeah, and I think there's no words in the world that's like the white term okay but one

554
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:46,680
 of the headings on the UK glowworm website is, is it really a glowworm?

555
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:53,160
 And then it says, one cause of false reports of glowworms is actually light reflected from

556
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:57,880
 shiny leaves due on litter.

557
00:26:57,880 --> 00:27:02,640
 Please check what you see really is a beetle with the light coming from the final tail segments.

558
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,880
 Not a solid vinegar crisp bucket.

559
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:11,080
 Because that's what they are, the beetles aren't they, they're not worms.

560
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:15,200
 So actually I think they're in a bit of trouble in the UK aren't they glowworms, a lot of

561
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,400
 them are dying out.

562
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:19,560
 I think they're improving a bit now, but for a while they did.

563
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:25,180
 One of the reasons is dog poo and apparently according to Nick Moise who's the assistant

564
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:29,680
 keeper at Derby Museum, he says the number of glowworms especially around him has gone

565
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:36,280
 down because dog poo creates more plant growth and they make it hard for the females and

566
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:40,480
 males of the glowworm species to find each other because there's so much plant life.

567
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:44,680
 That is fascinating and I'm going to take it up with Cajrith Council because they put

568
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:51,200
 a sign up on their cliff path which says, please excuse the overgrown path we like to encourage

569
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:54,000
 glowworms to hang out and breed here.

570
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,200
 That is obviously just an excuse for what lazy path clearance.

571
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,200
 That's interesting.

572
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:01,520
 Oh Nick Moise at the Derby Museum is wrong.

573
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:03,760
 So let's not jump to too many conglomerates.

574
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:07,000
 All the other two different species of glowworm.

575
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:10,440
 No, but I'd like to see a fight between Nick Moise and Cajrith counting.

576
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:19,800
 So I've been reading about various insects that live in caves and various animals so there's

577
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:24,760
 one you might like to know about which is a species of cave insect called Neo-Trogler and

578
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:30,560
 this is an interesting thing because the females have penises and the males have vaginas.

579
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:33,520
 Well, surely that makes some male and female, no?

580
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:34,920
 Well, no, here's the thing.

581
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:40,320
 So the female, it's a penis like organ, I think it's technically known as a gyneosome and

582
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:47,560
 it gets erections and it's spiny, like an old penis.

583
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:55,760
 So the female gets an erection in her gyneosome and the male has a vagina-like chamber, right?

584
00:28:55,760 --> 00:29:02,320
 And the female inserts her penis into the male to hold it still and then it acts like a vacuum

585
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:04,240
 cleaner and it sucks out the male's sperm.

586
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:05,240
 Oh my gosh.

587
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:07,240
 It's like the seal mollus all over.

588
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:10,280
 You can do that up to 70 hours straight.

589
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:11,280
 Wow.

590
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:12,960
 Yeah, and the thing is, the-

591
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:13,960
 70 hours.

592
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:14,960
 70 hours.

593
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:18,360
 And the really interesting thing is that, I mean, well, that's the really interesting thing but

594
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:20,640
 this other thing.

595
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:24,880
 So they're locked together unbelievably tightly due to these bristles and spines and pouches

596
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:27,720
 in the males of gyneor and the bristles on the penis.

597
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:30,840
 So there was a scientist from Hokkaido University of his experiment and he tried pulling

598
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:32,840
 a copulating pair apart and the-

599
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:33,840
 Oh, why would you do that?

600
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:34,840
 Well, I know.

601
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:38,880
 I think that's worse because the male was then ripped in two.

602
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:40,720
 It's a bad end to a date, isn't it?

603
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:42,320
 You think it's going so well?

604
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:48,480
 And then, yeah, so that possibly means that males in the natural world can't actually resist

605
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:50,920
 the act of mating because they'll do themselves more damage.

606
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:51,920
 Sure.

607
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:56,880
 I looked at a couple of things on insect camouflage strategies or insects disguising themselves

608
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,680
 as other things.

609
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:03,840
 So one of the things I love is that spiders, which obviously aren't insects, disguise

610
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:08,600
 themselves as ants by lifting up their two front legs and pretending that they're antenna

611
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:11,600
 by waving them above their heads.

612
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:13,280
 So then they only have six legs, obviously.

613
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:14,280
 Yeah, then they've only got six legs left.

614
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:16,640
 And then they lift another two and pretend to be a cow.

615
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:20,040
 And then another two and pretend to be a human.

616
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:26,080
 They've found, not too long ago, that camouflage within insects has been going back very, very

617
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:27,080
 long-top.

618
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:29,800
 They've actually found, in amber, the earliest example of it.

619
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:35,560
 And it was found by a Chinese academy of sciences in Nanjing, by a team led by Bo Wang.

620
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:38,360
 And it's called debris camouflage.

621
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:43,280
 And debris camouflage is when you just carry, effectively carrying a leaf on top of you.

622
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:49,000
 But they've got examples of it where it definitely was trying to hide underneath the leaf.

623
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:52,320
 Just like, "Sell it, say if he leaves you and pretend it to be a tree."

624
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:53,320
 Exactly.

625
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:56,760
 And none of you has asked me why I've got an empty pack of salt and vinegar crisps on top

626
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:57,760
 of my head.

627
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:02,040
 Okay, that probably was a glow worth it.

628
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:06,360
 Orkids disguise themselves as wasps so that other wasps will have sex with them.

629
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:09,600
 Rather than just attracting the wasps to come and pick up pollen, they actually make wasps

630
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:13,240
 come and mate with them by emitting smells that smell like a wasp and making themselves

631
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:14,240
 look like a wasp.

632
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:19,440
 And 75% of wasps who land on these orkids do actually ejaculate.

633
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:22,480
 So they just go away thinking, "Oh, I successfully had sex there."

634
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:23,480
 Isn't that weird?

635
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:25,280
 I think they've just mated with a wasp.

636
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:30,080
 The good thing is humans, we have no idea what the thing is that is persuading us to have

637
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:32,840
 sex with it by mentally, successfully mimicking a human isps.

638
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:44,480
 If I found out that my wife's been an orkid all this time, we don't know what's out there.

639
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:48,800
 Okay, that's it.

640
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:49,800
 That's all of our facts.

641
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:51,040
 Thank you so much for listening.
