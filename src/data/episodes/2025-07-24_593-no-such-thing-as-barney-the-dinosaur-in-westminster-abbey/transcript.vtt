00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 [Music]

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.400
 Hi everybody, it's Andy and James here from No Such Thing as a Fish.

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:07.880
 Hi, your favourite too.

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:09.440
 [Laughs]

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:10.320
 Shhh.

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:11.520
 But, yes.

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:13.400
 Now we're here with a little topper show announcement

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:16.360
 because we've got some secret juicy gossip for you.

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:17.520
 We sure have.

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.880
 And that gossip is that we are going to be doing some live shows.

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.320
 You didn't hear it from us.

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.320
 But if you go to King's Place in London

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.040
 on the 5th and 6th of September,

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:30.200
 you can see not one, but two No Such Thing as a Fish live shows.

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:32.040
 Dan and Anna will also be there for clarity.

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.880
 Anna will not be there for clarity.

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:35.440
 Yeah, sorry, yeah.

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:36.760
 Dan will be.

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:38.880
 And some very, very special guests.

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:41.800
 Now, we have already booked one of these special guests

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:45.320
 and I promise you, if I mentioned the name of that person right now,

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:47.000
 we would sell out in seconds.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.760
 That's right.

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.000
 And if it does sell out, there are streaming tickets available too.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.480
 You can watch the show live.

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:56.840
 See what it's like when we're not rigorously and scrupulously edited.

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:00.560
 Here, all the stuff we say that really should be edited out

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:02.080
 by getting a streaming ticket.

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:04.400
 And where do you get those tickets from, Andy?

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:06.480
 I think if they just go to our website, there'll be a link.

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:08.080
 No such thing as a fish.com.

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:08.840
 Excellent.

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:10.080
 Well, do that right now.

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.120
 But in the meantime, it's time to say,

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:14.560
 on with the podcast, on with the show.

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:38.480
 Hello and welcome to another episode of no such thing as a fish,

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:42.520
 a weekly podcast coming to you from the QI offices in Hoburn.

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:43.760
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:47.080
 I am sitting here with James Harkin, Andrew Hunter Murray,

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:48.320
 and Anna Tyshinski.

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:50.280
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.920
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days.

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.480
 And in no particular order, here we go.

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:59.280
 Starting with fact number one, and that is my fact.

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.920
 My fact this week is that before he was buried,

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.600
 the poet Dylan Thomas was used as a poker table.

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.600
 That doesn't feel very practical.

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:09.120
 No.

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:11.000
 The chicks are going to go everywhere.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.800
 And I imagine as a poet, you're wearing

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.600
 a lot of ruffles, maybe a cravat.

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.480
 You know, you're not going to be a smooth table.

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:18.360
 No. OK.

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.800
 So it's not his body that was physically used as the poker

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:25.680
 table. Dylan Thomas, as a bit of backstory, had been in America

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.920
 and he died on the 9th of November, 1953.

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.000
 Let's get right to the, let's cut to the chase.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.200
 Was he born before he died?

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.760
 I need to know all the context, Dan.

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:36.000
 So yeah, it was really unfortunate.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.200
 He was 39 years old.

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:38.240
 He was a big drinker.

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:40.480
 There's a bit of mystery about what actually caused his death.

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:42.000
 But there we have it, the facts.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.440
 He dies November, 1953.

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:47.760
 His wife, Caitlin, decides she doesn't want him to be buried

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:48.320
 in America.

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:51.160
 She wants to bring him back home to Wales, his home country.

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:51.480
 Yeah.

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.400
 And so she puts him on a ship and he's in the hold.

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:57.120
 And one night she's a bit disruptive upstairs

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:58.640
 and she gets sent downstairs.

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:59.920
 And it just so happens that she's

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:02.000
 bunking up very near to his coffin.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.920
 And she notices that all the sailors gather around the coffin

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:06.880
 and use it as the poker table.

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:09.000
 And she thought he would have loved this.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.920
 Yeah.

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:12.120
 So was it not obviously a coffin?

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:12.920
 I think it might have been.

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:15.000
 They might not have cared.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.280
 That's quite a macabre.

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.200
 I would have tried to find another table

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:20.760
 or just a packing crate or something.

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:21.160
 Would you?

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:22.680
 I would have gone out my way to find the coffin.

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:22.920
 Yeah.

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:24.200
 If you had there's a coffin on board.

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:27.400
 I genuinely think when I go, if I could organize it

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:30.000
 that my mates had a poker game on my coffin

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.440
 and they didn't mind, then I'd be down for that.

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:34.600
 It would be more golf for you, though, wouldn't it?

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:36.600
 That's hard to play in a coffin.

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:38.760
 Right.

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:39.880
 You could be the last hole.

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:42.760
 The 19th hole.

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:45.560
 I'm hoping that I'm laid down face up, actually.

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:52.960
 Apparently, like you said, there was some ruckus with Caitlyn.

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:56.440
 I read that she was in a cabin with, and I quote,

00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:00.240
 some sort of glamor queen that she really didn't like.

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:02.080
 And so she deliberately caused a ruckus

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:04.120
 so that she would get kicked out of that cabin.

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:05.160
 Yeah.

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:07.440
 Yeah, having now read up about Caitlyn,

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:10.360
 I wonder if that's true or if she was just generally causing

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:12.120
 ruckus, because that was the thing about them.

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:14.400
 They were sort of described as the prototype

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:16.360
 Sid and Nancy of the sex pistols.

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:18.360
 They were a couple that were destructive.

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:19.720
 They'd get huge fights.

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:21.480
 They would get drunk everywhere they went.

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:23.760
 But what's crazy is that when Caitlyn got back,

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:26.960
 she went on a pub crawl with the person who picked her up.

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:29.800
 And Dylan was just left in the car park in the coffin

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:32.480
 while they were getting pissed along the way in all the pubs

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:34.200
 towards where his home was going to be.

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:35.240
 Yeah.

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:39.680
 Did you find the claim that he was buried in a banana-shaped

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:41.160
 grave?

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:43.640
 No.

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:44.480
 No.

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:46.920
 OK, so we should say, also, most famous Welsh poet,

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:48.760
 arguably, I'd say, ever?

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:49.680
 For me, he is.

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:51.880
 I mean, he's barred territory.

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:53.800
 If someone asked me the name of a Welsh poet,

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:54.760
 he would be the one.

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:55.440
 Exactly.

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:58.880
 And he certainly was barred from most of his local pubs.

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:02.600
 Well, there is a claim, I read, that the grave digger was

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:05.760
 Defan Mute, and he only knew that he was burying a man whose

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:07.520
 favorite fruit was the banana.

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:11.400
 So in tribute, he originally dug a banana-shaped grave

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:13.360
 before being told off and told the grave digger.

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:15.480
 Now, I just think if you're a professional grave digger,

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:18.440
 you know that you very rarely get a banana-shaped coffin.

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:19.240
 Yeah.

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:21.880
 Do we know that his favorite fruit was banana?

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:24.520
 Do you know, the original thing is so untrue that I haven't

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:28.000
 even saw that yet.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.360
 I thought Defan Mute sounds like a Welsh name.

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:33.880
 I thought that was a name.

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:36.560
 So his death, Dan, you said that there was some weird things

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:37.120
 about that.

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:37.840
 Yeah.

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:42.320
 There was the idea that he drank so much that the night

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:45.960
 before he went into a coma, which then led to him going

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:47.600
 to hospital and eventually dying,

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:51.000
 he claimed to have drunk 18 whiskeys.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.160
 Also the line, say the line.

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:56.800
 Supposedly his last words were, I've just drunk 18

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:57.600
 straight whiskeys.

00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:59.640
 I think that's a record or something like that.

00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:00.600
 That's a great line.

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:01.840
 But that's not true, is it?

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:04.040
 He definitely said things after that.

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:06.760
 I think he did say that, actually, in fairness.

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:09.520
 But it was the day before and then the next day,

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:12.120
 he did talk to people and said different things.

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:15.840
 He said, God, kill for a banana right now.

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:17.640
 So it was the doctor's fault, right?

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:21.120
 So yeah, so he was sedated with some morphine.

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:22.320
 And he went into a coma.

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:24.280
 And he had pneumonia, which hadn't been diagnosed.

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:25.720
 And that was the problem with the morphine.

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:27.120
 But this is the interesting thing.

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:28.960
 I think it's actually Dylan Thomas' fault.

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:30.720
 Because he did make that joke about having

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:32.400
 had all these whiskeys, right?

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:35.800
 And then I believe his friend who'd overheard that,

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:37.480
 when he was really ill, said to the doctor,

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:39.640
 oh, well, he told me yesterday he'd had 18 straight whiskeys.

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:42.440
 So the doctor very naturally assumes alcohol poisoning

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:44.320
 and then gives him the morphine,

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:46.280
 which puts him into the coma, which kills him.

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:49.000
 So actually Dylan Thomas died of his own joke,

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.800
 as well as medical misdiagnosis and all of that.

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:53.480
 But basically it's because his friend said,

00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:54.760
 oh yeah, well, this is what he was saying.

00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:56.400
 - Well, it's possible he wasn't joking though,

00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:58.800
 because they went and interviewed the bartender

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:00.360
 who was serving drinks at night.

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:03.240
 And he said he didn't drink 18, absolutely not.

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:06.440
 But someone pointed out that a shot in America

00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:08.880
 versus a shot back home is three times the amount.

00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:11.080
 So they think in his incredibly drunken state,

00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:14.240
 Dylan Thomas was doing math and worked out

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:16.960
 how many that would have been back home, which was 18.

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:20.640
 - Yeah, in fairness, the math was only three times six.

00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:22.800
 - But once you've had 18 whiskeys.

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:27.160
 - He actually wasn't good at taking his drink.

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:29.840
 He's got this reputation for being such a heavy drinker.

00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:31.520
 But I think people who knew him said actually,

00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:32.800
 he was kind of a lightweight.

00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:34.480
 So maybe he just seemed pissed a lot.

00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:37.560
 He had a famous sort of relationship slash,

00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:39.800
 what's an enemy ship?

00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:40.720
 - Frenemy?

00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:41.640
 - He was sort of a frenemy,

00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:44.480
 but without the fruit of it with Kingsley Amos,

00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:45.440
 who only met him once,

00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:48.600
 but used to write really awful things about his poetry.

00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:49.440
 - Okay.

00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:50.560
 - And Amos met him in 1951.

00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:53.600
 And he said he was an outstandingly unpleasant man

00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:55.200
 who cheated and stole from his friends

00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:56.840
 and peed on their carpets.

00:07:56.840 --> 00:07:59.640
 And he boozed a lot because it fitted his image as a poet

00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:02.000
 rather than out of any thirst or need.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.040
 - I think people, quite a lot of people

00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:06.760
 didn't really like him very much, even his friends.

00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:09.200
 - No, it's a shame if you like his poetry to read up on him

00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:10.640
 because it makes him quite unlikable, doesn't it?

00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:12.760
 - I think he considered himself to be a poet,

00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:15.560
 which meant he didn't need to get a proper job.

00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:19.480
 He could just sort of dilettantishly turn up at people's houses

00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:22.400
 and sleep on their sofas and urinate on their carpets.

00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:24.120
 Perhaps, I don't know.

00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:26.000
 But yeah, like one of his really good friends,

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.400
 Norman Cameron, he wrote, "Who invited him in?

00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:30.440
 What was he doing here?

00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:33.840
 That insolent little ruffian, that crappulous lout?

00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:36.840
 When he quitted a sofa, he left behind a smear."

00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:38.680
 - Oh dear.

00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:40.080
 - That's what his friends thought of him,

00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:41.160
 what of his enemies.

00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:43.960
 - Right, but his fans kind of loved it, right?

00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:46.880
 They loved this image of a drunken poet

00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:48.920
 who was living up to that romantic idea

00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:51.440
 that they're sitting in a shed with a glass of whiskey,

00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:52.920
 writing these incredible lines.

00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:55.560
 And in his final eight years, you know, he died 39,

00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:58.160
 as I said, in the final eight years, he wrote six poems.

00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:00.200
 He spent basically the last period of his life

00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:03.560
 going on tours and talking and reading out his poems.

00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:06.040
 He became an orator as opposed to a writer.

00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:09.680
 And people would go because it was quite rock and roll.

00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:11.920
 Is Dylan Thomas gonna swear at someone in the crowd?

00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:14.280
 Is he gonna drunkenly fall off the stage and pass out?

00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:16.120
 - Is he gonna leave a smear on the sofa?

00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:17.920
 (all laughing)

00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:19.160
 - The curtain comes up and says,

00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:22.720
 "That's a sofa on the stage, get it Dylan!"

00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:25.000
 But he was kind of, you know, people were into that.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.440
 - I think he was less hard living in lots of ways.

00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:31.320
 So he lived for a while in a place called Lawn

00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:34.600
 and the Thomas family GP, the doctor,

00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:36.560
 wrote he didn't do any womanizing.

00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:37.600
 He was pretty sober.

00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:40.040
 He was very respectful.

00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:41.760
 He started the day by helping his dad

00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:44.240
 with the times crossword every morning.

00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:46.320
 Apparently his capacity for drink, I'm quoting now,

00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:49.080
 was very limited compared with the average hearty.

00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:50.240
 He couldn't drink very much.

00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:52.800
 Three or four pints was his absolute limit.

00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:55.040
 But then of his wife, Caitlyn, the doctor wrote,

00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:58.240
 "Caitlyn is a nymphomaniac and the first class bitch."

00:09:58.240 --> 00:09:59.560
 (all laughing)

00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:01.880
 - Is that a medical diagnosis back then?

00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:06.000
 She does seem a tough character.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:07.640
 But I really didn't know the thing

00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:09.520
 I found most unbelievable about him is

00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:10.960
 you say that he only wrote six poems

00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:12.320
 or whatever in his last seven years.

00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:14.640
 Really, he wrote all of his best poetry pretty much.

00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:16.960
 Everyone agrees by the time he was 19.

00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:18.160
 Isn't that insane?

00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:19.600
 I was a child when I was 19.

00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:21.440
 I was like, "You're thinking such immature stuff."

00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:23.280
 And that's why it's kind of nonsense.

00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:25.440
 I used to love him when I was a teenager

00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:28.240
 because I thought, "Well, this must mean something amazing."

00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:29.680
 But it was really heartening to read

00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:31.800
 all of these reviewers write about him and say,

00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:32.760
 "The words are beautiful,

00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:34.840
 "which is what's so fun about reading him,

00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:36.480
 "but no one knows what he's on about."

00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:38.080
 - He also, 'cause we were calling him a poet,

00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:40.600
 but he also wrote some pretty seminal other pieces.

00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:43.440
 Like he wrote "Under Milkwood," which was a play

00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:45.760
 which is still sort of known today.

00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:46.880
 - I did it at school.

00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:47.720
 - Did you really?

00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:48.560
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:49.560
 - I think people do, don't they, ladies?

00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:50.800
 - Who did you play?

00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:53.920
 - Sorry, no, for my GCSE English, I had to learn it.

00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:56.260
 - Okay, right, yeah, nice.

00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:59.160
 - You played a tree, admit it, you were one of the trees.

00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:01.960
 - But there's a lot of milk under me.

00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:07.000
 - You guys know AJP Taylor?

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:08.040
 - I only know the name as well.

00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:10.400
 He was a really famous 20th century historian,

00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:13.440
 like mega famous at a time when historians were rock stars.

00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:19.440
 Anyway, Dylan Thomas befriended his wife, Margaret,

00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:22.080
 and--

00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:23.240
 - Euphemism?

00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:26.800
 - Well, she definitely had the hots for him.

00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:29.120
 And Dylan Thomas went to stay on the sofa

00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:32.120
 and did a lot of, like he would stay for a month.

00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:34.840
 And AJP Taylor liked to keep a barrel of beer in the house.

00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:36.680
 That was just his nice thing.

00:11:36.680 --> 00:11:38.920
 But he hated having Dylan Thomas to stay

00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:41.480
 'cause he would drink supposedly 15 pints a day

00:11:41.480 --> 00:11:44.000
 and he'd constantly have to be replacing his barrel.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:45.200
 And Taylor's wife, Margaret,

00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:48.160
 fell absolutely besotted with Dylan Thomas.

00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:49.600
 She spent all her money on him.

00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:51.320
 She wrote him erotic letters.

00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:53.800
 She persuaded AJP Taylor to buy a house

00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:56.800
 for 2,000 pounds for Dylan Thomas.

00:11:56.800 --> 00:11:59.200
 And Taylor said, "Okay, fine, if you stop giving him money,"

00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:00.640
 which she did not.

00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:02.480
 And then she bought him another house.

00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:04.000
 - Jesus Christ.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.320
 - He does sound like a really annoying guy to have to stay.

00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:07.960
 - I read one anecdote about him.

00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:10.920
 He went out drinking with novelist Philip Lindsay

00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:13.040
 and got his penis stuck in a honeypot.

00:12:13.040 --> 00:12:15.760
 (all laughing)

00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:17.080
 - We need the poo take.

00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:19.320
 (all laughing)

00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:22.280
 - Great thing about this is in Andrew Lycet's biography

00:12:22.280 --> 00:12:24.680
 and it's kind of mostly there and not really anywhere else.

00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:27.320
 But it was from people who were there who said it happened.

00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:29.160
 But no one knows why he did that.

00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:30.000
 - No.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:30.840
 - Was it a honey trap?

00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:33.160
 (all laughing)

00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:34.560
 - They said on the same occasion,

00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:37.600
 he pushed a shirt button up his nose and couldn't get it out.

00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:39.440
 (all laughing)

00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:41.240
 You go into the A and E and you're like,

00:12:41.240 --> 00:12:43.280
 "Yeah, is this button thing?

00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:45.120
 "Can you get the button thing out, please?"

00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:46.720
 "Sir, there appears to be something."

00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:47.880
 "No, no, just the button."

00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:48.800
 (all laughing)

00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:50.520
 - I actually haven't just said, "Winnie the Pooh,"

00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:52.880
 I only know Winnie the Pooh-sized honeypots.

00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:54.000
 Do they come smaller?

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:55.600
 - Wait, does Winnie the Pooh have massive honeypots?

00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:56.720
 - Yeah, his head gets stuck in them.

00:12:56.720 --> 00:12:57.560
 - Oh, yeah.

00:12:57.560 --> 00:12:59.840
 Maybe Dylan Thomas was very well endowed

00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:01.120
 and that's what kept the women falling in.

00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:02.640
 - But the shape of a honeypot is,

00:13:02.640 --> 00:13:05.720
 it expands as it gets towards the base, as it were.

00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:07.080
 It's not like a honey jar.

00:13:07.080 --> 00:13:09.600
 I could understand him getting his penis stuck in a honey jar.

00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:11.120
 - I was imagining a honey jar.

00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:12.760
 - It's a set honey or runny honey.

00:13:12.760 --> 00:13:14.560
 - You know, when you go to a travel lodge

00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:16.960
 and you get those tiny little jars of honey.

00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:19.720
 (all laughing)

00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:20.560
 - We're gonna have to ask you

00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:21.760
 to leave the breakfast buffet.

00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:24.160
 (all laughing)

00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:27.080
 - Everyone's got their own sized honeypot.

00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:29.320
 Yeah, it's full of tantalising details about biography.

00:13:29.320 --> 00:13:31.080
 It's amazing, 'cause he's spoken to everyone

00:13:31.080 --> 00:13:34.080
 who ever knew him, but people just give memories

00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:35.440
 without elaboration.

00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:37.400
 So there's those two, there's, on one occasion,

00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:39.160
 he managed to stab himself in the eye

00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:41.520
 while eating a plate of meatballs.

00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:43.440
 No, no further details.

00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:44.280
 How do you do that?

00:13:44.280 --> 00:13:45.120
 - How do you do that?

00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:48.000
 - And then someone else said there was a particular period

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.280
 where he had to deal with his rubber fetishism.

00:13:50.280 --> 00:13:51.120
 No more on it.

00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:53.120
 - That's it, that's it, that's all we get.

00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:54.320
 - What did he do with rubber?

00:13:54.320 --> 00:13:56.680
 - Now, he's a very important poet.

00:13:56.680 --> 00:14:00.240
 He is part of the poet's corner in Westminster Abbey,

00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:01.960
 which is reserved for some of the greats,

00:14:01.960 --> 00:14:03.440
 it's Shakespeare and so on.

00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:04.800
 He originally wasn't in there.

00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:06.400
 And it all comes down to Jimmy Carter,

00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:10.080
 President Jimmy Carter, who lobbied for him to be in there.

00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:10.920
 - Why?

00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:12.760
 - He loves him to the point where he went

00:14:12.760 --> 00:14:15.080
 to certain bits of Wales just to be around the area

00:14:15.080 --> 00:14:17.440
 that Dylan Thomas would have been in.

00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:20.400
 Even wrote a poem called A President Expresses Concern

00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:23.120
 on a visit to Westminster Abbey by Jimmy Carter.

00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:23.960
 - No way.

00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:25.280
 - Gosh.

00:14:25.280 --> 00:14:27.160
 - That makes me like Dylan Thomas again,

00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:28.320
 having just gone off him.

00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:29.480
 Jimmy Carter liked him.

00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:31.200
 - Yeah, 'cause you're a massive Carter fan, yeah.

00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:32.040
 - Yeah.

00:14:32.040 --> 00:14:33.400
 What a weird presidential, like,

00:14:33.400 --> 00:14:35.120
 is that what happens on state visits?

00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:37.720
 - He campaigned a bit harder to get himself re-elected.

00:14:37.720 --> 00:14:38.560
 - Exactly.

00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:39.640
 - Well, it happened in '82,

00:14:39.640 --> 00:14:41.320
 so maybe he worked on it post-presidency,

00:14:41.320 --> 00:14:43.320
 but it was on that trip that he said, "Well, it was old."

00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:45.200
 - I can imagine Donald Trump at the moment

00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:47.400
 is trying to get Barney the big purple dinosaur

00:14:47.400 --> 00:14:48.480
 in Westminster Abbey.

00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:50.800
 - We'll do it, we'll do it.

00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:55.520
 Lawn, this place where he lived,

00:14:55.520 --> 00:14:58.800
 his local pub was a place called Brown's Hotel.

00:14:58.800 --> 00:15:02.680
 It was bought recently by, guess who?

00:15:02.680 --> 00:15:03.520
 - The game.

00:15:03.520 --> 00:15:04.360
 - The board makers.

00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:05.600
 - Sorry.

00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:10.080
 - Okay, give us a clue.

00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:11.120
 - What, the TV show?

00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:13.360
 (laughing)

00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:16.480
 - Why in a two runny skirt?

00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:19.240
 (laughing)

00:15:19.240 --> 00:15:22.760
 - No, what was Dylan Thomas?

00:15:22.760 --> 00:15:24.480
 He was a man behaving badly.

00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:25.320
 - Yeah.

00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:26.320
 - Oh, is it Martin Clues?

00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:27.640
 - It was Neil Morrissey.

00:15:27.640 --> 00:15:28.480
 - Oh, really?

00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:30.520
 - The other man behaving badly bought his local.

00:15:30.520 --> 00:15:31.360
 - Really?

00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:32.800
 - And Dylan Thomas was a man behaving badly,

00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:34.560
 and Neil Morrissey for international business

00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:37.240
 was about 30 years ago

00:15:37.240 --> 00:15:38.800
 in a second club called Mem Haven Badly.

00:15:38.800 --> 00:15:39.640
 - Yeah.

00:15:39.640 --> 00:15:40.480
 - That's a great fact.

00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:41.320
 - That's a great fact.

00:15:41.320 --> 00:15:43.900
 (upbeat music)

00:15:43.900 --> 00:15:47.160
 - Okay, it is time for fact number two,

00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:48.480
 and that is Andy.

00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:51.720
 - My fact is that six out of 10 lakes are in Canada.

00:15:51.720 --> 00:15:54.720
 - That's amazing.

00:15:54.720 --> 00:15:56.400
 - Out of all the lakes in the world.

00:15:56.400 --> 00:15:57.240
 - That's wild.

00:15:57.240 --> 00:15:58.880
 - 60% are in Canada.

00:15:58.880 --> 00:16:00.120
 - It's big, Canada.

00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:02.400
 - It is big, but it's not 60% of the world's.

00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:03.240
 - No.

00:16:03.240 --> 00:16:04.080
 - It's a lamb ass.

00:16:04.080 --> 00:16:05.680
 It's a disproportionate number of lakes.

00:16:05.680 --> 00:16:08.400
 - So if you wake up after a big old

00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:10.520
 Dylan Thomas-style bender,

00:16:10.520 --> 00:16:13.520
 and you look and there's a lake there,

00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:15.960
 you're more likely than not in Canada.

00:16:15.960 --> 00:16:16.800
 - That's right.

00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:17.640
 - Yeah.

00:16:17.640 --> 00:16:18.480
 - That's right.

00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:19.880
 - Do we know how many and why?

00:16:19.880 --> 00:16:20.800
 - We do.

00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:25.400
 900,000 and geology is the short.

00:16:25.400 --> 00:16:26.720
 - No further questions.

00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:28.600
 - No, I got this on a great substrate

00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:30.040
 by a guy called Thomas Pueyo.

00:16:30.040 --> 00:16:32.440
 And basically, at the bottom, you've got the Great Lakes,

00:16:32.440 --> 00:16:33.840
 sort of celebrity lakes.

00:16:33.840 --> 00:16:34.680
 - Yeah.

00:16:34.680 --> 00:16:36.840
 - And then there's this line stretching across the country,

00:16:36.840 --> 00:16:39.000
 above which it's just monstrously full of lakes,

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:41.360
 just lakes everywhere, like Thoreau Brick.

00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:44.520
 And it's because there's a region near the coast,

00:16:44.520 --> 00:16:47.560
 further up near the coastal mountains, which is lower,

00:16:47.560 --> 00:16:50.200
 'cause the mountains kind of depressed land around them

00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:52.400
 with their lamb mass, didn't know mountains did that.

00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:53.400
 And everywhere else in the world,

00:16:53.400 --> 00:16:54.920
 or most other places, these depressions,

00:16:54.920 --> 00:16:57.880
 they turn into river valleys, water flows along, right?

00:16:57.880 --> 00:16:59.480
 But Canada is very far north,

00:16:59.480 --> 00:17:02.640
 so it rains less, so there's less water.

00:17:02.640 --> 00:17:05.080
 And it's also to do with the ice sheets

00:17:05.080 --> 00:17:07.720
 that dug these huge holes in the ground.

00:17:07.720 --> 00:17:11.000
 And that leads to lakes when the ice retreats.

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:11.840
 Do you know what I mean?

00:17:11.840 --> 00:17:14.240
 You've got basically lake-shaped masses everywhere.

00:17:14.240 --> 00:17:18.160
 - Yeah, it was the Laurentide ice sheet, wasn't it?

00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:21.160
 And that also formed Niagara Falls and the Great Lakes.

00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:22.400
 So it was a biggie.

00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:26.280
 And it might also have given us Noah's Ark.

00:17:26.280 --> 00:17:29.800
 So apparently the collapse of that ice sheet

00:17:29.800 --> 00:17:33.120
 caused the flooding of the Gibraltar,

00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:35.240
 Straits of Gibraltar, loads of water going

00:17:35.240 --> 00:17:38.960
 into the Mediterranean Sea, huge floods everywhere

00:17:38.960 --> 00:17:41.680
 about 8,000 years ago, and maybe all the myths

00:17:41.680 --> 00:17:45.400
 that we have about floods in all different cultures

00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:48.520
 have flood myths, maybe due to that collapse.

00:17:48.520 --> 00:17:49.360
 Love it.

00:17:49.360 --> 00:17:50.560
 - That's amazing.

00:17:50.560 --> 00:17:51.400
 It's crazy.

00:17:51.400 --> 00:17:55.000
 So 900,000 lakes in Canada, you're saying Andy.

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:59.200
 Manitoba is an area that has 100,000 of those lakes.

00:17:59.200 --> 00:18:03.400
 And only 10,000 of those lakes have been named.

00:18:03.400 --> 00:18:06.240
 As of 2017, the number will have gone up,

00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:07.440
 but they're trying to give names

00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:08.960
 to every single lake that's out there.

00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:09.800
 - Can we campaign?

00:18:09.800 --> 00:18:12.800
 - Well, here's the thing to what have a lake named after us.

00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:13.640
 Doesn't work like that.

00:18:13.640 --> 00:18:14.600
 - Fish Lake.

00:18:14.600 --> 00:18:21.280
 - Well, this is a problem that there's not a big group

00:18:21.280 --> 00:18:22.160
 that names the lakes.

00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:24.400
 There's one main guy and then he's got a few assistants.

00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:25.240
 - What?

00:18:25.240 --> 00:18:26.080
 - Yeah.

00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:26.920
 - Well, that's why they haven't gone around

00:18:26.920 --> 00:18:27.760
 to name them all yet.

00:18:27.760 --> 00:18:28.600
 - It's been very slow.

00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:31.600
 He'll name like seven a year, but that's gone up now

00:18:31.600 --> 00:18:32.440
 with the assistants.

00:18:32.440 --> 00:18:34.440
 - Maybe as slow as Dylan Thomas writing poetry.

00:18:34.440 --> 00:18:37.080
 Is this guy just going around doing rock star shows

00:18:37.080 --> 00:18:38.680
 and saying, "I named lakes"?

00:18:38.680 --> 00:18:39.520
 - Exactly.

00:18:39.520 --> 00:18:40.880
 The thing he says is he gets a lot of calls

00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:42.920
 on Valentine's Day with people saying,

00:18:42.920 --> 00:18:45.080
 "Can I in a romantic gesture name this lake

00:18:45.080 --> 00:18:47.840
 "after my partner or girlfriend or boyfriend or whatever?"

00:18:47.840 --> 00:18:49.640
 And he says, "No, it doesn't work like that."

00:18:49.640 --> 00:18:52.280
 - Is he stressed that all these lakes don't have names

00:18:52.280 --> 00:18:53.120
 or is he relaxed about it?

00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:54.520
 - He's relaxed, he's taken his time.

00:18:54.520 --> 00:18:56.080
 What they're doing is basically naming it

00:18:56.080 --> 00:18:59.160
 after fallen soldiers from World War II and World War I.

00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:00.520
 And it's important work

00:19:00.520 --> 00:19:03.080
 because if you happen to have an accident at a lake,

00:19:03.080 --> 00:19:04.880
 how do you find it if there's no name?

00:19:04.880 --> 00:19:05.880
 - Dan, if it's important work,

00:19:05.880 --> 00:19:07.720
 maybe he should be trying to name more than seven

00:19:07.720 --> 00:19:08.560
 every year.

00:19:08.560 --> 00:19:10.720
 - He has, there was one year where they named 2,000.

00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:13.120
 Like it's with it because he got assistants in,

00:19:13.120 --> 00:19:13.960
 assistants came in.

00:19:13.960 --> 00:19:15.000
 - Pegas can't be choosers.

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:18.120
 I think if I say, "Can you name your lake Polina?"

00:19:18.120 --> 00:19:20.200
 He shouldn't be saying, "No, I have to do it

00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:22.000
 "after this other thing instead."

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:23.760
 - I think he should be accepting these names

00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:25.480
 because he needs 20,000 of them.

00:19:25.480 --> 00:19:26.880
 - He needs a lot of, he needs a lot.

00:19:26.880 --> 00:19:29.240
 And in fact, there's only been one exception so far.

00:19:29.240 --> 00:19:32.440
 One living person, when an Olympic gold medalist

00:19:32.440 --> 00:19:34.840
 in hockey was given a lake name,

00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:37.280
 he sort of got put ahead of all the fallen soldiers.

00:19:37.280 --> 00:19:38.680
 - They'll do anything for hockey players,

00:19:38.680 --> 00:19:40.400
 the Canadians, right Ney?

00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:41.800
 I think he needs to be sacked.

00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:42.640
 Sorry.

00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:46.680
 - Do you know what the most common lake name

00:19:46.680 --> 00:19:48.760
 in the United States of America is?

00:19:48.760 --> 00:19:51.680
 - Oh, is it, is it guessable?

00:19:51.680 --> 00:19:52.520
 - Maybe.

00:19:52.520 --> 00:19:55.000
 - Is it Big Lake or Deep Lake?

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:56.280
 - No, but you're getting there.

00:19:56.280 --> 00:19:57.920
 It's very descriptive.

00:19:57.920 --> 00:19:59.760
 - Round Lake.

00:19:59.760 --> 00:20:00.600
 - Round Lake.

00:20:00.600 --> 00:20:01.440
 - Wet Lake.

00:20:01.440 --> 00:20:03.880
 - That's the closest.

00:20:03.880 --> 00:20:05.240
 It's Mud Lake.

00:20:05.240 --> 00:20:06.080
 - Really?

00:20:06.080 --> 00:20:09.560
 - Yeah, there are 900 Mud Lakes in America,

00:20:09.560 --> 00:20:11.640
 but they're endangered really,

00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:13.520
 'cause they're all getting renamed.

00:20:13.520 --> 00:20:17.080
 So Michigan, for instance, had 300 Mud Lakes,

00:20:17.080 --> 00:20:20.200
 but 71 of them have been changed in the last few years.

00:20:20.200 --> 00:20:21.520
 - Why are they changing them?

00:20:21.520 --> 00:20:22.520
 Is it not politically correct?

00:20:22.520 --> 00:20:24.560
 - Well, one reason that you want to,

00:20:24.560 --> 00:20:26.200
 like Mud Lake isn't very nice,

00:20:26.200 --> 00:20:28.160
 but number two, like Dan said,

00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:30.240
 you need to be able to tell exactly where something is.

00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:33.440
 So if you've got 700 Mud Lakes,

00:20:33.440 --> 00:20:35.600
 and you say I've injured myself next to Mud Lake,

00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:37.000
 what are they going to do?

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:38.000
 - Yeah, you're right.

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:39.840
 There are reports, and again,

00:20:39.840 --> 00:20:41.920
 this is at the level of Dylan Thomas

00:20:41.920 --> 00:20:43.560
 was buried in a banana shape.

00:20:43.560 --> 00:20:44.400
 - Oh God.

00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:45.240
 - It's great.

00:20:45.240 --> 00:20:48.040
 Well, there's a lake in Canada called Lake Minnewenka,

00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:49.800
 but that is true.

00:20:49.800 --> 00:20:52.560
 Some reports say it's the smallest lake in Canada,

00:20:52.560 --> 00:20:53.520
 and it appears not to be.

00:20:53.520 --> 00:20:55.320
 I think there are some smaller,

00:20:55.320 --> 00:20:56.840
 but it is home to a drowned village,

00:20:56.840 --> 00:20:58.720
 which is called Minnewenka Landing.

00:20:58.720 --> 00:20:59.560
 - Cool.

00:20:59.560 --> 00:21:00.400
 (laughing)

00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:02.800
 'Cause that was named after someone who drove a mini.

00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:06.000
 - It was when Tom Cruise lands his plane.

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:08.320
 That's why he radiates into the control tower as a joke.

00:21:08.320 --> 00:21:09.960
 (laughing)

00:21:09.960 --> 00:21:13.000
 - All this depends on how you define a lake, right?

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:13.840
 - Yeah.

00:21:13.840 --> 00:21:16.320
 - Because there's a thing called Lagos, L-A-G-O-S,

00:21:16.320 --> 00:21:18.040
 which is like a research.

00:21:18.040 --> 00:21:20.160
 It's like the Wikipedia of lakes,

00:21:20.160 --> 00:21:21.560
 where you go to if you wanna know anything

00:21:21.560 --> 00:21:23.360
 about lakes in North America,

00:21:23.360 --> 00:21:26.320
 but they define a lake as something that is one hectare

00:21:26.320 --> 00:21:28.160
 in area, surface area.

00:21:28.160 --> 00:21:30.440
 So that's about two football fields.

00:21:30.440 --> 00:21:33.680
 But if you were to count lakes that are like one hectare,

00:21:33.680 --> 00:21:34.680
 so half that size,

00:21:34.680 --> 00:21:36.220
 then the number of lakes in Canada

00:21:36.220 --> 00:21:37.680
 goes up to 3.5 million.

00:21:37.680 --> 00:21:38.800
 - Oh my goodness.

00:21:38.800 --> 00:21:39.880
 - That's getting stupid.

00:21:39.880 --> 00:21:41.000
 I was supposed to get a puddle.

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:43.680
 - That guy at the naming office is gonna be,

00:21:43.680 --> 00:21:45.440
 probably still relaxed.

00:21:45.440 --> 00:21:46.440
 We've got time.

00:21:46.440 --> 00:21:48.760
 - And the other scientific definition of a lake

00:21:48.760 --> 00:21:50.760
 is it needs to have an aphotic zone.

00:21:50.760 --> 00:21:53.520
 So that's an area deep enough where

00:21:53.520 --> 00:21:55.560
 plants can't grow, 'cause they don't get enough light.

00:21:55.560 --> 00:21:56.400
 - Oh really?

00:21:56.400 --> 00:21:57.240
 - Okay.

00:21:57.240 --> 00:21:59.800
 - That's supposed to be the level between a pond and a lake.

00:21:59.800 --> 00:22:01.680
 - There's, interestingly, on the definition of a lake,

00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:04.000
 there's also the bigness of lakes.

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:07.560
 So Lake Superior, one of the great lakes,

00:22:07.560 --> 00:22:08.440
 and the great lakes are all shared

00:22:08.440 --> 00:22:11.480
 between the US and Canada, except one, Lake Michigan.

00:22:11.480 --> 00:22:13.520
 Lake Superior is the largest lake on earth,

00:22:13.520 --> 00:22:17.040
 but only if you don't count the Caspian Sea,

00:22:17.040 --> 00:22:19.000
 which is about five times bigger.

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:21.880
 And it's really interesting, the Caspian Sea controversy,

00:22:21.880 --> 00:22:26.880
 because Caspian Sea is technically a lake, I believe,

00:22:26.880 --> 00:22:29.360
 as in it's not connected to the sea,

00:22:29.360 --> 00:22:32.000
 but it has higher salinity than almost any other lake.

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:33.760
 So it's a huge political debate

00:22:33.760 --> 00:22:36.640
 between Azerbaijan, Iran, Kazakhstan, Russia,

00:22:36.640 --> 00:22:40.520
 Turkmenistan, which all border this lake/sea,

00:22:40.520 --> 00:22:42.920
 'cause if it's a lake, you split it equally.

00:22:42.920 --> 00:22:46.040
 So that's why all the great lakes are split equally

00:22:46.040 --> 00:22:47.480
 between the US and Canada.

00:22:47.480 --> 00:22:48.560
 And it's usually important,

00:22:48.560 --> 00:22:50.280
 'cause it's got massive natural resources.

00:22:50.280 --> 00:22:51.920
 It's got loads of loads of oil deposits in it,

00:22:51.920 --> 00:22:53.080
 mineral deposits.

00:22:53.080 --> 00:22:56.920
 And so Iran, which has a very short coast on the Caspian,

00:22:56.920 --> 00:22:58.600
 is saying, no, it's definitely a lake.

00:22:58.600 --> 00:22:59.440
 Definitely a lake,

00:22:59.440 --> 00:23:01.160
 'cause I want to split it equally with the rest of you.

00:23:01.160 --> 00:23:03.760
 - Whereas if it's the seashore,

00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:06.880
 you own a distance away from the seashore.

00:23:06.880 --> 00:23:08.600
 - Depending on your length of coastline.

00:23:08.600 --> 00:23:09.680
 Exactly.

00:23:09.680 --> 00:23:12.400
 So then, you know, Russia's saying, or Kazakhstan,

00:23:12.400 --> 00:23:13.240
 which has a huge coastline,

00:23:13.240 --> 00:23:14.360
 is saying, this is bullshit.

00:23:14.360 --> 00:23:16.560
 You can't take a fifth of the oil in it.

00:23:16.560 --> 00:23:17.400
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:23:17.400 --> 00:23:18.240
 - Wow.

00:23:18.240 --> 00:23:19.080
 - So which side do you fall on?

00:23:19.080 --> 00:23:21.480
 - And when would we get a resolution to...

00:23:21.480 --> 00:23:23.760
 - No, honestly, turn.

00:23:23.760 --> 00:23:25.800
 I think they got a few other things to iron out

00:23:25.800 --> 00:23:26.640
 in that region.

00:23:26.640 --> 00:23:29.560
 - Yeah, there was a massive meeting in 2018

00:23:29.560 --> 00:23:31.320
 called the Convention on the Legal Status

00:23:31.320 --> 00:23:34.120
 of the Caspian Sea, where all the countries met,

00:23:34.120 --> 00:23:35.120
 and they were there for weeks,

00:23:35.120 --> 00:23:37.080
 and they concluded it's neither a lake nor a sea.

00:23:37.080 --> 00:23:37.920
 - Oh, great.

00:23:37.920 --> 00:23:40.760
 - It's a pond.

00:23:42.320 --> 00:23:43.240
 Here's a lake.

00:23:43.240 --> 00:23:45.760
 This is also in the United States of America.

00:23:45.760 --> 00:23:47.280
 It's called Crater Lake,

00:23:47.280 --> 00:23:49.960
 and the Kalmath people who live around it

00:23:49.960 --> 00:23:53.240
 haven't looked at it for more than 7,000 years.

00:23:53.240 --> 00:23:54.560
 - No.

00:23:54.560 --> 00:23:56.600
 How close do they live?

00:23:56.600 --> 00:23:57.440
 - They don't know.

00:23:57.440 --> 00:24:00.080
 (all laughing)

00:24:00.080 --> 00:24:00.920
 - Do they fall in?

00:24:00.920 --> 00:24:02.680
 - No, they don't fall in.

00:24:02.680 --> 00:24:05.480
 So it's basically, it's a taboo.

00:24:05.480 --> 00:24:06.320
 - Wow.

00:24:06.320 --> 00:24:09.160
 - And it's, we think down to an eruption

00:24:09.160 --> 00:24:12.040
 that happened 7,700 years ago,

00:24:12.040 --> 00:24:14.200
 and then they preserved these stories

00:24:14.200 --> 00:24:16.260
 of this myth that's happened,

00:24:16.260 --> 00:24:20.520
 and that would be 300 generations of word of mouth

00:24:20.520 --> 00:24:21.960
 have kept this story going.

00:24:21.960 --> 00:24:22.800
 - Don't look at the lake.

00:24:22.800 --> 00:24:24.040
 - And they still don't look at the lake, yeah.

00:24:24.040 --> 00:24:25.920
 - What if you accidentally look at the lake?

00:24:25.920 --> 00:24:27.720
 - Another eruption, probably.

00:24:27.720 --> 00:24:29.720
 - Someone must have.

00:24:29.720 --> 00:24:30.640
 - No one's done it.

00:24:30.640 --> 00:24:31.480
 We don't know.

00:24:31.480 --> 00:24:33.160
 (all laughing)

00:24:33.160 --> 00:24:34.000
 - Well, we'd know.

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:34.840
 We would know.

00:24:34.840 --> 00:24:35.680
 - We would know, yeah?

00:24:35.680 --> 00:24:36.520
 - Wow.

00:24:36.520 --> 00:24:37.960
 - That's crazy.

00:24:37.960 --> 00:24:40.520
 - Some lakes swing from side to side.

00:24:40.520 --> 00:24:42.000
 - Really? - Like a banana.

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:44.880
 - Well, they're called banana lakes.

00:24:44.880 --> 00:24:45.720
 No, they're not.

00:24:45.720 --> 00:24:46.560
 - Okay.

00:24:46.560 --> 00:24:47.400
 - This is amazing though.

00:24:47.400 --> 00:24:48.640
 They're these things called sashes,

00:24:48.640 --> 00:24:50.680
 and the most famous one is in Lake Erie,

00:24:50.680 --> 00:24:52.320
 which is one of the great lakes.

00:24:52.320 --> 00:24:54.920
 But basically, it happens if there's a really strong wind

00:24:54.920 --> 00:24:56.320
 that's going in one direction on a lake,

00:24:56.320 --> 00:24:58.720
 and it keeps pushing the water up to one end,

00:24:58.720 --> 00:25:00.880
 and then the wind suddenly stops,

00:25:00.880 --> 00:25:03.640
 then the water, you can imagine like in a bath,

00:25:03.640 --> 00:25:06.960
 swings backwards, and it does extraordinary things.

00:25:06.960 --> 00:25:11.840
 Like in 2008, there were 16 feet high waves in Lake Erie

00:25:11.840 --> 00:25:14.160
 that flooded, it's Buffalo, I think,

00:25:14.160 --> 00:25:15.960
 in New York that always gets flooded.

00:25:15.960 --> 00:25:20.280
 In 1844, there was a 22 foot high Seish wave,

00:25:20.280 --> 00:25:22.320
 which caused this flood in Buffalo,

00:25:22.320 --> 00:25:24.520
 which destroyed the town completely,

00:25:24.520 --> 00:25:25.760
 just from this swinging lake.

00:25:25.760 --> 00:25:26.600
 - Crazy.

00:25:26.600 --> 00:25:30.120
 - 78 people died, it stopped the Niagara Falls from flowing,

00:25:30.120 --> 00:25:32.600
 'cause it dammed it up, 'cause like the force of all the water

00:25:32.600 --> 00:25:34.960
 pushed the ice to the top of Niagara Falls,

00:25:34.960 --> 00:25:36.080
 and stopped it flowing.

00:25:36.080 --> 00:25:36.920
 - What?

00:25:36.920 --> 00:25:38.920
 - Just from this swinging lake, isn't that cool?

00:25:38.920 --> 00:25:39.920
 - That's very cool.

00:25:39.920 --> 00:25:41.480
 Not the deaths, but yeah, the other stuff.

00:25:41.480 --> 00:25:42.440
 - Yeah, it was a long time ago.

00:25:42.440 --> 00:25:43.280
 - Okay.

00:25:43.280 --> 00:25:44.120
 - Yeah.

00:25:44.120 --> 00:25:47.720
 - Canada is so big that the southernmost point of Canada

00:25:47.720 --> 00:25:49.760
 is closer to Brazil than it is

00:25:49.760 --> 00:25:51.360
 to the northernmost point of Canada.

00:25:51.360 --> 00:25:52.960
 - I don't believe you.

00:25:52.960 --> 00:25:54.960
 - Well, you've got to.

00:25:54.960 --> 00:25:55.800
 - Okay.

00:25:55.800 --> 00:25:56.640
 - Maths.

00:25:56.640 --> 00:25:57.480
 - How do we resolve this then?

00:25:57.480 --> 00:25:58.320
 (all laughing)

00:25:58.320 --> 00:25:59.520
 - We need a conference.

00:25:59.520 --> 00:26:01.680
 (all laughing)

00:26:01.680 --> 00:26:05.560
 - I mean, yeah, only because I've seen maps.

00:26:05.560 --> 00:26:09.120
 - I mean, that's, it's about, there's not much in it,

00:26:09.120 --> 00:26:10.840
 it's about 10 kilometers in it, but it's a lot.

00:26:10.840 --> 00:26:11.920
 - 10 kilometers in it?

00:26:11.920 --> 00:26:12.760
 - Yeah.

00:26:12.760 --> 00:26:13.600
 - That's so close.

00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:14.960
 - Southernmost point of Canada to northernmost point

00:26:14.960 --> 00:26:18.440
 of Canada is 4,620 kilometers.

00:26:18.440 --> 00:26:19.360
 - Right.

00:26:19.360 --> 00:26:22.400
 - To Brazil, from the southernmost point of Canada,

00:26:22.400 --> 00:26:24.400
 it's 4,630.

00:26:24.400 --> 00:26:25.240
 - Yeah.

00:26:25.240 --> 00:26:29.440
 - That's like how my house in Margate is closer to Belgium

00:26:29.440 --> 00:26:31.000
 than it is to London.

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:31.840
 - Yeah.

00:26:31.840 --> 00:26:32.680
 - That's wild.

00:26:32.680 --> 00:26:33.880
 - And it takes you hours and hours and hours

00:26:33.880 --> 00:26:34.880
 to get here every day.

00:26:34.880 --> 00:26:36.720
 (all laughing)

00:26:36.720 --> 00:26:38.160
 - I should stop going via Belgium.

00:26:38.160 --> 00:26:40.160
 (all laughing)

00:26:40.160 --> 00:26:42.740
 (upbeat music)

00:26:42.740 --> 00:26:47.240
 - Okay, it is time for fact number three,

00:26:47.240 --> 00:26:48.480
 and that is James.

00:26:48.480 --> 00:26:50.040
 - Okay, my fact this week is that

00:26:50.040 --> 00:26:52.280
 at one Spanish football stadium,

00:26:52.280 --> 00:26:54.520
 they will stop you from eating sunflower seeds,

00:26:54.520 --> 00:26:57.360
 but they won't stop you from smoking.

00:26:57.360 --> 00:26:58.880
 - That is so weird.

00:26:58.880 --> 00:27:00.320
 Is it?

00:27:00.320 --> 00:27:03.360
 Are you allowed to smoke sunflower seeds, life hack?

00:27:03.360 --> 00:27:04.680
 - Oh, good thinking.

00:27:04.680 --> 00:27:05.520
 - Yeah.

00:27:05.520 --> 00:27:06.360
 - Yeah, roll up.

00:27:06.360 --> 00:27:07.400
 (all laughing)

00:27:07.400 --> 00:27:10.360
 - Actually, you're not really supposed to smoke,

00:27:10.360 --> 00:27:12.520
 but they don't enforce that ban.

00:27:12.520 --> 00:27:13.360
 - Oh, okay.

00:27:13.360 --> 00:27:15.680
 - But they are enforcing that ban on sunflower seeds,

00:27:15.680 --> 00:27:19.600
 and that's because if you go to Spanish football games,

00:27:19.600 --> 00:27:23.320
 you will often bring sunflower seeds with you as a snack.

00:27:23.320 --> 00:27:25.000
 They're called pipas,

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:28.920
 and this team called Elche has decided to ban them

00:27:28.920 --> 00:27:30.160
 because people keep,

00:27:30.160 --> 00:27:32.920
 you kind of, you crack them open and eat the seeds inside,

00:27:32.920 --> 00:27:34.880
 and then you throw the shells away,

00:27:34.880 --> 00:27:36.600
 and the shells, they clog the drains,

00:27:36.600 --> 00:27:38.520
 they clog the pipes,

00:27:38.520 --> 00:27:41.560
 they rot and deteriorate the seeds,

00:27:41.560 --> 00:27:44.420
 the pigeons come, rats come,

00:27:44.420 --> 00:27:47.280
 and they're having to basically redo the entire stadium,

00:27:47.280 --> 00:27:51.000
 and part of the reason is because these sunflower seeds

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:52.760
 are just all over the place and they're rotting,

00:27:52.760 --> 00:27:54.160
 and they're making everything ming in.

00:27:54.160 --> 00:27:55.920
 - Yeah, there's too many for them to clean up,

00:27:55.920 --> 00:27:57.560
 so as you arrive,

00:27:57.560 --> 00:27:59.600
 you just crack in shells underneath your foot,

00:27:59.600 --> 00:28:00.680
 go into your seats.

00:28:00.680 --> 00:28:02.480
 It's pretty amazing,

00:28:02.480 --> 00:28:04.200
 such a tiny thing causing such chaos.

00:28:04.200 --> 00:28:05.920
 - And this was in the times that I read this,

00:28:05.920 --> 00:28:07.920
 and one of the fans said this is the best thing

00:28:07.920 --> 00:28:08.760
 they could have done,

00:28:08.760 --> 00:28:11.000
 and now they just have to enforce the ban on smoking.

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:11.960
 (laughing)

00:28:11.960 --> 00:28:12.920
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:28:12.920 --> 00:28:15.200
 Is it Spain-wide that these things are enjoyed?

00:28:15.200 --> 00:28:17.160
 - It's common throughout Spain, yeah.

00:28:17.160 --> 00:28:18.000
 - Really interesting,

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:20.000
 'cause it's quite a hippie-ish, quite healthy thing,

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:22.600
 I imagine, like, oh, I'm just eating some sunflower seeds.

00:28:22.600 --> 00:28:24.240
 - This is a really salty.

00:28:24.240 --> 00:28:26.120
 - Oh, okay, they're very snacky.

00:28:26.120 --> 00:28:27.440
 - This is the thing that I discovered,

00:28:27.440 --> 00:28:30.280
 it's this whole global culture that we do not have

00:28:30.280 --> 00:28:33.080
 in Britain of sunflower seeds being such a popular snack,

00:28:33.080 --> 00:28:34.200
 and they're all these countries,

00:28:34.200 --> 00:28:35.960
 so Spain is one of them,

00:28:35.960 --> 00:28:36.800
 where they're really popular,

00:28:36.800 --> 00:28:37.840
 across Eastern Europe,

00:28:37.840 --> 00:28:39.120
 Eastern European listeners,

00:28:39.120 --> 00:28:41.720
 writing, "Confirm how many sunflower seeds you eat a day."

00:28:41.720 --> 00:28:43.600
 China, the Middle East, Russia,

00:28:43.600 --> 00:28:45.840
 they're like this big deal snack,

00:28:45.840 --> 00:28:48.720
 and so I think in China, you have them in the shells,

00:28:48.720 --> 00:28:50.720
 and it's this great meditative experience,

00:28:50.720 --> 00:28:53.080
 the one girl was saying that you put it in your mouth,

00:28:53.080 --> 00:28:55.720
 you have to get the sunflower seed out of the shell.

00:28:55.720 --> 00:28:58.000
 - Yeah, you kind of do it with your teeth on it, yeah.

00:28:58.000 --> 00:28:59.640
 - So the little gray thing that I get

00:28:59.640 --> 00:29:00.800
 when I buy a packet of sunflower seeds

00:29:00.800 --> 00:29:02.240
 is not a sunflower seed,

00:29:02.240 --> 00:29:04.440
 it's actually, that's the kernel.

00:29:04.440 --> 00:29:05.280
 - Yeah, it's a kernel.

00:29:05.280 --> 00:29:06.360
 - A de-hulled kernel,

00:29:06.360 --> 00:29:08.360
 whereas people here are eating the naked seeds,

00:29:08.360 --> 00:29:10.520
 which are the black and white striped, they're bigger.

00:29:10.520 --> 00:29:11.880
 - Better inside, yeah.

00:29:11.880 --> 00:29:13.200
 - That is a sunflower seed.

00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:14.920
 - Yeah, and it's pretty amazing.

00:29:14.920 --> 00:29:17.880
 I went to the National Gallery the other day

00:29:17.880 --> 00:29:21.680
 to look specifically at Van Gogh's sunflowers, right?

00:29:21.680 --> 00:29:22.720
 - I was research with this fact.

00:29:22.720 --> 00:29:24.280
 - No, it's completely separate.

00:29:24.280 --> 00:29:26.680
 I was just, I thought, "God, it's around the corner,

00:29:26.680 --> 00:29:27.640
 why have I not been there?"

00:29:27.640 --> 00:29:29.040
 And I went, stood, and just stared,

00:29:29.040 --> 00:29:31.280
 and each flower, there's 11 flowers,

00:29:31.280 --> 00:29:34.040
 they contain about 2000, between one and 2000 seeds.

00:29:34.040 --> 00:29:37.280
 That would have been edible, you know, what was in the pot.

00:29:37.280 --> 00:29:38.520
 I find that fascinating.

00:29:38.520 --> 00:29:40.640
 I've never thought about it in that way before.

00:29:40.640 --> 00:29:41.480
 - No, me neither.

00:29:41.480 --> 00:29:42.320
 If you're really hungry

00:29:42.320 --> 00:29:43.760
 and you've got a sunflower growing in your kitchen,

00:29:43.760 --> 00:29:46.560
 scrape off the top, if it's reached ripeness,

00:29:46.560 --> 00:29:47.400
 and get some seeds out.

00:29:47.400 --> 00:29:49.640
 - There's like a TikTok trend at the moment

00:29:49.640 --> 00:29:53.600
 where people are like roasting entire sunflower heads

00:29:53.600 --> 00:29:54.440
 and eating them.

00:29:54.440 --> 00:29:56.000
 - Ooh. - They're really.

00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:58.080
 - I mean, it's just classic TikTok.

00:29:58.080 --> 00:29:58.920
 - That doesn't seem so.

00:29:58.920 --> 00:29:59.760
 - Everyone's a food expert

00:29:59.760 --> 00:30:01.440
 until you actually try what you're eating,

00:30:01.440 --> 00:30:02.320
 and then it's disgusting.

00:30:02.320 --> 00:30:04.400
 - Well, people do seem to rave about them.

00:30:04.400 --> 00:30:05.720
 And I was reading in China,

00:30:05.720 --> 00:30:07.640
 the way they harvest them is really cool.

00:30:07.640 --> 00:30:09.320
 So people go through with digmachetes

00:30:09.320 --> 00:30:10.560
 or massive pairs of scissors,

00:30:10.560 --> 00:30:12.600
 and they chop the heads off all the...

00:30:12.600 --> 00:30:14.280
 Yeah, or nail scissors, whatever you've got to have.

00:30:14.280 --> 00:30:16.480
 - Like you're opening a department store.

00:30:16.480 --> 00:30:18.840
 - Yeah, exactly, a lot of ribbons to cut.

00:30:18.840 --> 00:30:21.360
 They chop the heads off each individual sunflower,

00:30:21.360 --> 00:30:23.520
 but then they pick up the heads,

00:30:23.520 --> 00:30:24.720
 they spin them upside down,

00:30:24.720 --> 00:30:26.960
 and they plonk them back on top of the stalk,

00:30:26.960 --> 00:30:29.440
 and they leave them there for another week to dry.

00:30:29.440 --> 00:30:31.280
 And that's 'cause it saves having to dry them

00:30:31.280 --> 00:30:32.320
 in a certain space.

00:30:32.320 --> 00:30:36.360
 So you'll sometimes go to a big sunflower field in China

00:30:36.360 --> 00:30:38.600
 and be like, "Oh, the flowers are upside down."

00:30:38.600 --> 00:30:40.200
 - Yeah. - They've all been decapitated.

00:30:40.200 --> 00:30:41.280
 - They've all been decapitated

00:30:41.280 --> 00:30:42.760
 and had their heads put on upside down.

00:30:42.760 --> 00:30:44.040
 - Who did this?

00:30:44.040 --> 00:30:45.880
 - That's amazing. - What a psycho.

00:30:45.880 --> 00:30:48.560
 - So I should just say L.J., by the way,

00:30:48.560 --> 00:30:50.880
 the football team, they're from Alicante.

00:30:50.880 --> 00:30:53.080
 They were promoted to La Liga last season.

00:30:53.080 --> 00:30:55.480
 And I read as much as I could about them.

00:30:55.480 --> 00:30:57.840
 There's not a great deal of interesting stuff,

00:30:57.840 --> 00:31:01.560
 apart from the Ketman, the head Ketman is called Pepito,

00:31:01.560 --> 00:31:04.360
 whose name is Spanish for pumpkin seed.

00:31:04.360 --> 00:31:06.120
 - Lovely, lovely.

00:31:06.120 --> 00:31:07.560
 - It's not quite right, is it?

00:31:07.560 --> 00:31:08.840
 - No. - You haven't quite

00:31:08.840 --> 00:31:10.480
 got that almost all the time. - Almost got it.

00:31:10.480 --> 00:31:12.440
 I saw his name and I was like,

00:31:12.440 --> 00:31:14.920
 "That really looks like it means sunflower seed."

00:31:14.920 --> 00:31:16.240
 - Yeah. - But unfortunately,

00:31:16.240 --> 00:31:18.040
 no, 'pipas' is the sunflower seed,

00:31:18.040 --> 00:31:20.080
 which also means blowjobs in Greek.

00:31:20.080 --> 00:31:21.320
 - Golly. - Oh, cool.

00:31:21.320 --> 00:31:23.480
 - Well, that wasn't,

00:31:23.480 --> 00:31:25.800
 surely that one would have led to any confusion.

00:31:25.800 --> 00:31:30.200
 A load of Spanish football fans turn up at Panofinaikos.

00:31:30.200 --> 00:31:32.160
 - You've got to crack it open with your teeth.

00:31:32.160 --> 00:31:34.400
 (laughing)

00:31:34.400 --> 00:31:39.160
 - They are known these seeds as Spain's football foreplay.

00:31:39.160 --> 00:31:42.040
 I don't know if you can cross that phrase here.

00:31:42.040 --> 00:31:43.680
 But what is Britain's football foreplay?

00:31:43.680 --> 00:31:45.160
 - Pies. - You guys go to football with pies.

00:31:45.160 --> 00:31:46.920
 - Pies of pies. - Nice pie.

00:31:46.920 --> 00:31:48.800
 - As in, that's just foreplay in general, isn't it?

00:31:48.800 --> 00:31:50.880
 A nice steak and kidney pie.

00:31:50.880 --> 00:31:52.320
 - Scotch pies, they're called.

00:31:52.320 --> 00:31:53.400
 - What is a Scotch pie?

00:31:53.400 --> 00:31:55.640
 - Scotch pie is,

00:31:55.640 --> 00:31:57.800
 probably if you go to football in the South of England,

00:31:57.800 --> 00:31:58.880
 you don't really get this stuff,

00:31:58.880 --> 00:32:00.240
 but certainly in the North of England,

00:32:00.240 --> 00:32:03.800
 they're kind of made of pastry, like water pastry,

00:32:03.800 --> 00:32:06.720
 and they usually have mutton in them, lots of potato,

00:32:06.720 --> 00:32:09.200
 not so much meat, absolutely delicious.

00:32:09.200 --> 00:32:10.440
 - Yeah. - Yum.

00:32:10.440 --> 00:32:14.480
 - And they were supposedly despised by the Scottish Church,

00:32:14.480 --> 00:32:17.480
 because they were considered a sumptuous meal

00:32:17.480 --> 00:32:20.000
 and very similar to English pies.

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:23.720
 So the Scottish Church tried to ban Scotch pies for a while,

00:32:23.720 --> 00:32:24.720
 but they never managed.

00:32:24.720 --> 00:32:26.160
 - I would say keep your beaks out, guys.

00:32:26.160 --> 00:32:29.600
 I just think that's not the jurisdiction to...

00:32:29.600 --> 00:32:31.440
 - Like the Church tends to get involved

00:32:31.440 --> 00:32:33.480
 in lots of different things, doesn't it?

00:32:33.480 --> 00:32:35.840
 Historically, especially the Scottish Church.

00:32:35.840 --> 00:32:37.240
 - I just think that's a bit like Jimmy Carter

00:32:37.240 --> 00:32:40.960
 getting involved in Dylan Thomas' posthumous reputation.

00:32:40.960 --> 00:32:42.520
 I just think, come on, prioritise.

00:32:42.520 --> 00:32:44.440
 - Not your area. - You've got perks to run.

00:32:44.440 --> 00:32:47.800
 - Actually, it was because of the Church,

00:32:47.800 --> 00:32:50.880
 I think that sunflower seeds came to be.

00:32:50.880 --> 00:32:53.960
 - Well, unless you're saying that God made them.

00:32:53.960 --> 00:32:55.400
 - Exactly.

00:32:55.400 --> 00:32:58.800
 Sorry, yeah, that we started eating sunflower seeds,

00:32:58.800 --> 00:33:01.360
 because, so they were huge in Russia first.

00:33:01.360 --> 00:33:03.760
 Russia was like 100 years ahead of the rest of us,

00:33:03.760 --> 00:33:05.760
 mainly in terms of turning them into oil,

00:33:05.760 --> 00:33:07.160
 which is where it's so valuable.

00:33:07.160 --> 00:33:10.520
 And it was basically because during any kind of fast,

00:33:10.520 --> 00:33:13.360
 Christian fasting or Lent or anything like that in Russia,

00:33:13.360 --> 00:33:15.720
 then any kind of vegetable oils were banned,

00:33:15.720 --> 00:33:18.400
 and then Peter the Great or his minions have discovered

00:33:18.400 --> 00:33:20.440
 that you could get oil from sunflower seeds.

00:33:20.440 --> 00:33:21.880
 - It was Peter the Great when he, you know,

00:33:21.880 --> 00:33:25.640
 he did his European tour, he saw them in like the Netherlands

00:33:25.640 --> 00:33:26.800
 or something and brought them back.

00:33:26.800 --> 00:33:28.040
 - He did, yes.

00:33:28.040 --> 00:33:31.000
 And then some peasant in Russia in the 19th century,

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:33.400
 just working in the fields peasant,

00:33:33.400 --> 00:33:35.840
 built a machine to get oil out of them.

00:33:35.840 --> 00:33:37.960
 And because they were new oil,

00:33:37.960 --> 00:33:40.400
 the Church hadn't managed to create in its list

00:33:40.400 --> 00:33:42.240
 the name sunflower oil. - It's so funny.

00:33:42.240 --> 00:33:44.040
 - And so everyone just drenched their food

00:33:44.040 --> 00:33:45.600
 with sunflower oil during Lent.

00:33:45.600 --> 00:33:46.560
 That's why it was so popular.

00:33:46.560 --> 00:33:50.160
 - And now Ukraine and Russia is by far the biggest producers

00:33:50.160 --> 00:33:52.560
 of sunflower oil in the world, like by a billion.

00:33:52.560 --> 00:33:55.880
 - I read that, it's like, more than half the global production

00:33:55.880 --> 00:33:56.720
 is there. - Yeah.

00:33:56.720 --> 00:33:58.280
 And that's why Ukraine like the sunflower

00:33:58.280 --> 00:33:59.400
 is a symbol of Ukraine.

00:33:59.400 --> 00:34:01.440
 - I see, I didn't know that.

00:34:01.440 --> 00:34:03.400
 - It was used as well for mopping up basically

00:34:03.400 --> 00:34:06.760
 a lot of the radioactive waste during the Chernobyl disaster.

00:34:06.760 --> 00:34:07.600
 - Was it?

00:34:07.600 --> 00:34:08.440
 - Yeah, so the stems,

00:34:08.440 --> 00:34:10.960
 they noticed that when they put them into bodies of water,

00:34:10.960 --> 00:34:13.480
 that it would take up a lot of the radioactive elements

00:34:13.480 --> 00:34:14.680
 and then they could bring it away

00:34:14.680 --> 00:34:16.840
 and then they could discard it in a better way.

00:34:16.840 --> 00:34:19.320
 But so, sunflowers are planted largely

00:34:19.320 --> 00:34:22.480
 around nuclear radioactive areas in Chernobyl and use.

00:34:22.480 --> 00:34:23.480
 - Gosh, sunflowers are useful.

00:34:23.480 --> 00:34:24.320
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:34:24.320 --> 00:34:27.720
 - Famous pop culture person who eats sunflower seeds.

00:34:27.720 --> 00:34:29.360
 - Okay.

00:34:29.360 --> 00:34:30.200
 - Cardi B.

00:34:30.200 --> 00:34:33.760
 - Cardi B.

00:34:33.760 --> 00:34:34.600
 - Good shout.

00:34:34.600 --> 00:34:35.960
 - Someone that you guys have,

00:34:35.960 --> 00:34:37.640
 a character that you guys will be familiar with.

00:34:37.640 --> 00:34:38.480
 - Can you give us a clue?

00:34:38.480 --> 00:34:40.680
 - Olex Snoopy, a fictional character.

00:34:40.680 --> 00:34:42.120
 - Yeah, 1990s.

00:34:42.120 --> 00:34:43.960
 - 1990s fictional character.

00:34:43.960 --> 00:34:45.480
 - The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air.

00:34:45.480 --> 00:34:46.320
 - Very good, no.

00:34:46.320 --> 00:34:47.520
 - Dennis the Manus.

00:34:47.520 --> 00:34:48.360
 - No.

00:34:48.360 --> 00:34:49.400
 - Oh yeah, cartoon or real?

00:34:49.400 --> 00:34:50.240
 - Real.

00:34:50.240 --> 00:34:52.040
 - Zach from "Saved by the Bell".

00:34:52.040 --> 00:34:55.640
 - Okay, Blobby, Blobby, Blobby.

00:34:55.640 --> 00:34:56.600
 - British or American?

00:34:56.600 --> 00:34:57.440
 - American.

00:34:57.440 --> 00:34:58.280
 - Okay.

00:34:58.280 --> 00:35:00.040
 - One of the Simpsons.

00:35:00.040 --> 00:35:02.360
 - No, but one of the biggest shows of the 1990s.

00:35:02.360 --> 00:35:03.200
 - Friends.

00:35:03.200 --> 00:35:05.000
 - People are yelling this at home, not friends.

00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:08.840
 Something that Dan would like due to his other podcast.

00:35:08.840 --> 00:35:11.200
 - A weird equippity thing.

00:35:11.200 --> 00:35:14.840
 - Come on guys, the truth is out there.

00:35:14.840 --> 00:35:17.880
 - Oh, the ex-Fox Mulder loved Sunflower Seeds.

00:35:17.880 --> 00:35:21.160
 - Fox Mulder, he eats Sunflower Seeds all the way through it.

00:35:21.160 --> 00:35:23.480
 And he had to stop in the later series

00:35:23.480 --> 00:35:24.440
 because according to him,

00:35:24.440 --> 00:35:26.440
 it's hard to act with Sunflower Seeds.

00:35:26.440 --> 00:35:30.160
 But it was the creator, Chris Carter,

00:35:30.160 --> 00:35:32.240
 who would eat Sunflower Seeds.

00:35:32.240 --> 00:35:34.720
 And he kind of passed it on to the character.

00:35:34.720 --> 00:35:36.960
 But David D'Covny, who played Mulder,

00:35:36.960 --> 00:35:38.680
 wants people to know that he doesn't like

00:35:38.680 --> 00:35:41.760
 Sunflower Seeds and he also does not wear ties.

00:35:41.760 --> 00:35:44.120
 So fans are discouraged from sending him either.

00:35:44.120 --> 00:35:48.560
 - Poor guy, so he's forced to eat the Sunflower Seeds

00:35:48.560 --> 00:35:49.720
 constantly.

00:35:49.720 --> 00:35:51.800
 - And wear lots of ties as well.

00:35:51.800 --> 00:35:53.320
 Poor guy.

00:35:53.320 --> 00:35:54.640
 - I mentioned Van Gogh earlier.

00:35:54.640 --> 00:35:56.480
 There's another very famous art piece

00:35:56.480 --> 00:35:57.960
 which is called Sunflower Seeds.

00:35:57.960 --> 00:35:59.080
 Do you remember that?

00:35:59.080 --> 00:35:59.920
 - Ai Wei Wei.

00:35:59.920 --> 00:36:01.920
 - Ai Wei Wei, 2011.

00:36:01.920 --> 00:36:04.000
 So this is extraordinary.

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:06.840
 He handcrafted Porcelain Sunflower Seeds

00:36:06.840 --> 00:36:09.400
 with his team, there was 1,600 people,

00:36:09.400 --> 00:36:13.120
 and they made 100 million of them.

00:36:13.120 --> 00:36:14.640
 - It feels like he's the guy to solve

00:36:14.640 --> 00:36:17.160
 the Canadian Lake naming dilemma.

00:36:17.160 --> 00:36:19.280
 Like they can just bang through that.

00:36:19.280 --> 00:36:22.800
 - If these 1,600 people, I'm sure, you know,

00:36:22.800 --> 00:36:25.000
 it's making a very important political point

00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:26.200
 and stuff like that.

00:36:26.200 --> 00:36:30.320
 But it's a long time to be making tiny ceramic seeds.

00:36:30.320 --> 00:36:32.560
 - Oh, I see, I think it's a bit of a waste of time.

00:36:32.560 --> 00:36:34.440
 - I mean, being a podcaster is a waste of time.

00:36:34.440 --> 00:36:38.360
 I'm fully accept that, but I just think...

00:36:38.360 --> 00:36:42.360
 - We've made 100 million identical episodes of this show.

00:36:42.360 --> 00:36:44.120
 But it has been useful, I would say.

00:36:44.120 --> 00:36:44.960
 Yes, what's the point?

00:36:44.960 --> 00:36:46.000
 - They weren't identical, were they?

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:47.720
 They were slightly, I remember this.

00:36:47.720 --> 00:36:48.960
 - Oh, 'cause they handcrafted.

00:36:48.960 --> 00:36:50.440
 - I was talking about the episodes of the show,

00:36:50.440 --> 00:36:53.880
 which is why I remember the slight differences.

00:36:53.880 --> 00:36:56.080
 - Well, they put, and so they were first displayed

00:36:56.080 --> 00:36:58.120
 at the Turbine Hall at the Tate.

00:36:58.120 --> 00:37:00.640
 And if you've ever been there, you know what that's like.

00:37:00.640 --> 00:37:03.080
 - Yeah, you get these huge exhibits

00:37:03.080 --> 00:37:04.240
 that are really famous every year.

00:37:04.240 --> 00:37:05.080
 I went to that one, actually.

00:37:05.080 --> 00:37:05.920
 - Did you?

00:37:05.920 --> 00:37:07.000
 Did you get to walk on the seeds?

00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:07.840
 - No, I didn't.

00:37:07.840 --> 00:37:09.080
 - 'Cause I got to walk around on them.

00:37:09.080 --> 00:37:12.400
 - So to begin with, and it raised up about 10 centimetres

00:37:12.400 --> 00:37:14.720
 off the ground, that's how many seeds are where the height

00:37:14.720 --> 00:37:15.560
 that it reached to.

00:37:15.560 --> 00:37:16.400
 - Only 10 centimetres?

00:37:16.400 --> 00:37:17.640
 - Well, it's a big, it's huge hole.

00:37:17.640 --> 00:37:18.640
 - Yeah, it's a massive hole.

00:37:18.640 --> 00:37:19.480
 - Not very much.

00:37:19.480 --> 00:37:20.920
 - Put it in a smaller room, have 'em up to your neck.

00:37:20.920 --> 00:37:21.920
 That's what I would have done.

00:37:21.920 --> 00:37:22.760
 - Good idea.

00:37:22.760 --> 00:37:24.000
 - Like, that's exciting.

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:25.040
 - No, that's hard.

00:37:25.040 --> 00:37:28.400
 So was the point he's making is that we're all different?

00:37:28.400 --> 00:37:30.320
 - No, the point he was making, I believe.

00:37:30.320 --> 00:37:32.720
 Well, there's lots of different points like much art,

00:37:32.720 --> 00:37:33.560
 but I think a lot of it.

00:37:33.560 --> 00:37:35.400
 And this is why the trampling was so important.

00:37:35.400 --> 00:37:37.000
 And I remember being so disappointed

00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:39.560
 is about the oppression and repression of the Chinese state

00:37:39.560 --> 00:37:41.200
 and all these people, these, you know,

00:37:41.200 --> 00:37:43.120
 billions of people in China being treated

00:37:43.120 --> 00:37:46.240
 just like one random identical sunflower to another.

00:37:46.240 --> 00:37:47.080
 Don't have your own.

00:37:47.080 --> 00:37:49.440
 - And I think Chairman Mao used to say

00:37:49.440 --> 00:37:52.680
 that the people of China were sunflower seeds.

00:37:52.680 --> 00:37:54.840
 And his idea is like, if you get all

00:37:54.840 --> 00:37:57.320
 of these hundred million seeds together,

00:37:57.320 --> 00:37:59.920
 then they make something very big and important.

00:37:59.920 --> 00:38:02.560
 But by themselves, they're kind of...

00:38:02.560 --> 00:38:04.600
 - Oh yeah, that's a different interpretation.

00:38:04.600 --> 00:38:05.440
 There you go.

00:38:05.440 --> 00:38:06.280
 - I don't know.

00:38:06.280 --> 00:38:08.680
 Like you, I went and was slightly disappointed

00:38:08.680 --> 00:38:10.120
 that I wasn't allowed to walk on them.

00:38:10.120 --> 00:38:11.680
 - And you weren't allowed, to begin with,

00:38:11.680 --> 00:38:13.880
 you were allowed to walk on them and then health and safety

00:38:13.880 --> 00:38:15.200
 because they thought little micro dust

00:38:15.200 --> 00:38:16.920
 was coming through from all the crunching.

00:38:16.920 --> 00:38:19.880
 But it worked out that the equivalent sunflower seeds

00:38:19.880 --> 00:38:25.000
 that he made, that Van Gogh would have to paint,

00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:27.160
 would be 50,000 flowers.

00:38:27.160 --> 00:38:28.000
 - Okay.

00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:29.880
 - Because it's about 2,000 seeds per herd, right?

00:38:29.880 --> 00:38:30.720
 - About 2,000.

00:38:30.720 --> 00:38:31.560
 I think that math, right?

00:38:31.560 --> 00:38:34.400
 I was 18 whiskies deep by the time I did that, but yeah.

00:38:34.400 --> 00:38:35.240
 - That's doable.

00:38:35.240 --> 00:38:38.400
 - Baseball players also love sunflower seeds, apparently,

00:38:38.400 --> 00:38:39.520
 in the USA.

00:38:39.520 --> 00:38:41.920
 There is this question of why baseball players

00:38:41.920 --> 00:38:43.840
 are constantly chewing.

00:38:43.840 --> 00:38:44.680
 'Cause they are.

00:38:44.680 --> 00:38:46.560
 If you look at them in the dugout, they're always eating.

00:38:46.560 --> 00:38:49.200
 So there's one big theory is that the game is boring.

00:38:49.200 --> 00:38:52.680
 - My daughter, when she gets bored,

00:38:52.680 --> 00:38:54.360
 she always asks, can I have a snack?

00:38:54.360 --> 00:38:56.600
 - Right, the theory is that's what they're doing.

00:38:56.600 --> 00:38:57.600
 You know, they're sporting guys.

00:38:57.600 --> 00:38:59.320
 They will burn it off, but basically,

00:38:59.320 --> 00:39:01.520
 it's a dull game to watch and to participate in.

00:39:01.520 --> 00:39:03.080
 - I really like lots of sports,

00:39:03.080 --> 00:39:06.200
 but I do find it difficult to sit in a stadium

00:39:06.200 --> 00:39:07.880
 through an entire baseball game.

00:39:07.880 --> 00:39:09.000
 - Right, there we go.

00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:10.640
 - I think there really is a divide in the world,

00:39:10.640 --> 00:39:11.920
 which no other sport has,

00:39:11.920 --> 00:39:14.280
 between people who understand why baseball's appealing

00:39:14.280 --> 00:39:16.760
 and are obsessed with it, and friends obsessed,

00:39:16.760 --> 00:39:18.200
 and the rest of us who think,

00:39:18.200 --> 00:39:21.160
 "Well, but it sounds like all the players are on our side."

00:39:21.160 --> 00:39:22.000
 - Well, they...

00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:26.120
 They know from the inside.

00:39:26.120 --> 00:39:27.680
 But they used to chew tobacco.

00:39:27.680 --> 00:39:30.040
 That's another theory why people,

00:39:30.040 --> 00:39:31.240
 they might choose sunflower seeds now,

00:39:31.240 --> 00:39:32.760
 'cause you don't chew tobacco anymore.

00:39:32.760 --> 00:39:35.720
 - But chewing tobacco could give them some buzz.

00:39:35.720 --> 00:39:37.320
 - And they had another big advantage.

00:39:37.320 --> 00:39:39.040
 When baseball players chew tobacco,

00:39:39.040 --> 00:39:41.680
 they could slobber their juice onto the ball.

00:39:41.680 --> 00:39:42.520
 (laughing)

00:39:42.520 --> 00:39:43.360
 - Interesting.

00:39:43.360 --> 00:39:45.760
 - And Phil and Thomas used to slather his juice

00:39:45.760 --> 00:39:46.920
 onto the surface of the...

00:39:46.920 --> 00:39:48.760
 (laughing)

00:39:48.760 --> 00:39:51.680
 - If you slobbered on the ball, it would become darker,

00:39:51.680 --> 00:39:54.240
 and that would be harder for the batter to see.

00:39:54.240 --> 00:39:57.080
 So it's a tricky, sneaky way

00:39:57.080 --> 00:39:58.880
 of making a camouflage ball.

00:39:58.880 --> 00:40:01.400
 - I understand this against the rules to do that.

00:40:01.400 --> 00:40:05.200
 - The rule was changed in 1920 to disallow ball defacing.

00:40:05.200 --> 00:40:06.640
 That was what it was defined as.

00:40:06.640 --> 00:40:08.240
 So maybe that's another reason

00:40:08.240 --> 00:40:09.280
 for the rise of the sunflower seed,

00:40:09.280 --> 00:40:12.200
 apart from the unbearable tedium of watching this game.

00:40:12.200 --> 00:40:13.600
 (laughing)

00:40:13.600 --> 00:40:16.840
 - Okay, speaking of tedious American sports,

00:40:16.840 --> 00:40:19.040
 I mean, I absolutely love American football,

00:40:19.040 --> 00:40:23.160
 but what snacks do you associate with American football?

00:40:23.160 --> 00:40:24.640
 - Weeners, get your weeners.

00:40:24.640 --> 00:40:26.480
 - Hot dogs, oh, that's the same as a weener, isn't it?

00:40:26.480 --> 00:40:27.840
 - So hot dogs, for me,

00:40:27.840 --> 00:40:31.240
 I would more have hot dogs at a baseball game, probably.

00:40:31.240 --> 00:40:33.840
 - Candy gloss.

00:40:33.840 --> 00:40:34.840
 - Nutshells.

00:40:34.840 --> 00:40:36.040
 - Yeah, all these are good answers.

00:40:36.040 --> 00:40:36.880
 - Caviar.

00:40:36.880 --> 00:40:38.200
 - Caviar is correct.

00:40:38.200 --> 00:40:40.880
 From the Caspian Sea, the belugas.

00:40:40.880 --> 00:40:43.600
 No, it's, I think for me, it's chicken wings.

00:40:43.600 --> 00:40:44.440
 - Okay.

00:40:44.440 --> 00:40:45.880
 - If you're watching the Super Bowl,

00:40:45.880 --> 00:40:48.920
 everyone in America basically eats chicken wings.

00:40:48.920 --> 00:40:52.520
 And this all came due to an accidental

00:40:52.520 --> 00:40:56.000
 over-order by a company in Buffalo.

00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:58.800
 They accidentally ordered a load of chicken wings

00:40:58.800 --> 00:41:01.120
 and they didn't know what to do with them.

00:41:01.120 --> 00:41:03.920
 And so they came up with a new recipe,

00:41:03.920 --> 00:41:06.040
 which was Buffalo wings.

00:41:06.040 --> 00:41:08.440
 So you basically put chili sauce and butter together

00:41:08.440 --> 00:41:10.920
 and it makes this sauce and they're absolutely delicious.

00:41:10.920 --> 00:41:14.240
 And this bar called Anchor Bay, they started making them.

00:41:14.240 --> 00:41:15.720
 And then a little bit later,

00:41:15.720 --> 00:41:19.240
 the Buffalo Bill's NFL team made it to the Super Bowl

00:41:19.240 --> 00:41:20.760
 for three years in a row.

00:41:20.760 --> 00:41:23.120
 And everyone associated the Buffalo Bill's team

00:41:23.120 --> 00:41:24.600
 with Buffalo wings.

00:41:24.600 --> 00:41:28.120
 And suddenly chicken wings became like the food

00:41:28.120 --> 00:41:30.000
 for the Super Bowl.

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:31.160
 - So it's all a big mistake.

00:41:31.160 --> 00:41:33.360
 - It's a whole different thing.

00:41:33.360 --> 00:41:36.240
 But 1.6 billion chicken wings are eaten

00:41:36.240 --> 00:41:38.040
 on Super Bowl Sunday every year.

00:41:38.040 --> 00:41:38.880
 - Jesus.

00:41:38.880 --> 00:41:41.560
 I think, 'cause Americans get some shit sometimes

00:41:41.560 --> 00:41:42.600
 from the rest of the world

00:41:42.600 --> 00:41:44.480
 about certain elements of their culture.

00:41:44.480 --> 00:41:46.080
 But one of the greatest cultural things

00:41:46.080 --> 00:41:47.080
 that exists in America,

00:41:47.080 --> 00:41:48.760
 which I didn't really know that it was a thing,

00:41:48.760 --> 00:41:50.160
 is tailgating.

00:41:50.160 --> 00:41:51.000
 - Tailgating.

00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:52.160
 - Or the tailgate.

00:41:52.160 --> 00:41:54.160
 - Driving very close to the person in front of you.

00:41:54.160 --> 00:41:55.840
 - Well, indeed. - That's the only thing I know.

00:41:55.840 --> 00:41:57.560
 - That's all we know it as.

00:41:57.560 --> 00:42:01.520
 But like basically at any NFL match in the parking lot,

00:42:01.520 --> 00:42:04.560
 then you'll have a tailgate party and there's hosts.

00:42:04.560 --> 00:42:07.080
 And I was asking when my husband's lived in America

00:42:07.080 --> 00:42:09.640
 and he was like, yeah, I mean, literally everyone does it.

00:42:09.640 --> 00:42:11.080
 Every NFL match.

00:42:11.080 --> 00:42:13.520
 - I've been to a couple of NFL matches in America

00:42:13.520 --> 00:42:15.080
 and I never got invited to this party.

00:42:15.080 --> 00:42:17.400
 - I'm so sorry. - Wow, interesting.

00:42:17.400 --> 00:42:18.800
 - So wait, sorry, you go to the car park.

00:42:18.800 --> 00:42:19.640
 - Yep.

00:42:19.640 --> 00:42:23.040
 And there are just people who are such big fans of the team

00:42:23.040 --> 00:42:25.720
 that they cook up a massive feast.

00:42:25.720 --> 00:42:28.120
 They've made like a hundred burgers and pizzas for everyone

00:42:28.120 --> 00:42:30.640
 and loads of beers and just everyone has it.

00:42:30.640 --> 00:42:33.200
 They have a big party, but kind of anyone's invited.

00:42:33.200 --> 00:42:34.820
 So you go and it's called tailgating.

00:42:34.820 --> 00:42:37.460
 - Well, almost anyone's, don't rub it in, am I not?

00:42:37.460 --> 00:42:39.520
 (all laughing)

00:42:39.520 --> 00:42:41.680
 - I was starving that day.

00:42:41.680 --> 00:42:43.480
 - Driving around a completely empty town,

00:42:43.480 --> 00:42:44.320
 weren't you James?

00:42:44.320 --> 00:42:45.160
 - I was over a body.

00:42:45.160 --> 00:42:46.800
 - All the restaurants were closed.

00:42:46.820 --> 00:42:49.400
 (all laughing)

00:42:49.400 --> 00:42:57.480
 - Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show

00:42:57.480 --> 00:42:59.040
 and that is Anna.

00:42:59.040 --> 00:43:01.840
 - My fact this week is that Singaporeans drink

00:43:01.840 --> 00:43:05.360
 more than a bottle of Scotch per person per month,

00:43:05.360 --> 00:43:08.480
 which is twice as much as their nearest rivals.

00:43:08.480 --> 00:43:09.320
 - Wow. - Wow.

00:43:09.320 --> 00:43:10.160
 - What?

00:43:10.160 --> 00:43:12.560
 - I say the children of Dylan Thomas.

00:43:12.560 --> 00:43:14.000
 - I like the way you say rivals,

00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:16.800
 like there's a big sort of international competition

00:43:16.800 --> 00:43:18.960
 for who can drink the most Scotch.

00:43:18.960 --> 00:43:20.600
 - Per-old Latvia coming second,

00:43:20.600 --> 00:43:21.920
 desperately trying to catch up.

00:43:21.920 --> 00:43:22.760
 - Are they second Latvia?

00:43:22.760 --> 00:43:23.720
 - Latvia a second. - Really?

00:43:23.720 --> 00:43:24.560
 - Yeah.

00:43:24.560 --> 00:43:26.360
 - A bottle of Scotch per person per month.

00:43:26.360 --> 00:43:27.480
 - Isn't that insane?

00:43:27.480 --> 00:43:28.440
 - That is a lot.

00:43:28.440 --> 00:43:31.680
 - Latvia has their own, what is it now?

00:43:31.680 --> 00:43:32.960
 I have some at home.

00:43:32.960 --> 00:43:35.680
 It's like schnapps-y stuff that Latvians drink.

00:43:35.680 --> 00:43:37.480
 So, and they have balsam as well.

00:43:37.480 --> 00:43:38.320
 - Balsam, yeah.

00:43:38.320 --> 00:43:40.680
 - So like, they're spreading themselves too thin,

00:43:40.680 --> 00:43:42.040
 the Latvians, I didn't say that.

00:43:42.040 --> 00:43:42.880
 - You're right.

00:43:42.880 --> 00:43:43.720
 - I could call.

00:43:43.720 --> 00:43:45.480
 - Give up the balsam and having tasted the balsam,

00:43:45.480 --> 00:43:46.320
 just give up the balsam.

00:43:46.320 --> 00:43:48.160
 - Yeah, and then you'll win.

00:43:48.160 --> 00:43:49.280
 - Stick with the whiskey.

00:43:49.280 --> 00:43:52.080
 - So a bottle per person per month.

00:43:52.080 --> 00:43:54.240
 - Or they buy a bottle of Scotch per person per month.

00:43:54.240 --> 00:43:55.880
 And I think that's an important distinction

00:43:55.880 --> 00:43:58.120
 'cause I struggled to really find the reason.

00:43:58.120 --> 00:44:00.480
 - 'Cause I, like, I've got a bottle of whiskey at home

00:44:00.480 --> 00:44:02.280
 and I've been working on it pretty solidly

00:44:02.280 --> 00:44:03.120
 for a couple of years now.

00:44:03.120 --> 00:44:05.960
 And I mean, like, I've got past the halfway mark.

00:44:05.960 --> 00:44:08.680
 But is all this whiskey being drunk

00:44:08.680 --> 00:44:10.920
 or is it that it's just being bought and stored?

00:44:10.920 --> 00:44:12.000
 - Well, it's not clear.

00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:14.960
 So the stats are from the Scotch Whiskey Association.

00:44:14.960 --> 00:44:18.760
 So, which says that they export 12.76 bottles a year.

00:44:18.760 --> 00:44:20.640
 They have all the export figures.

00:44:20.640 --> 00:44:22.840
 In case you're wondering, domestically,

00:44:22.840 --> 00:44:23.680
 in case you're wondering,

00:44:23.680 --> 00:44:26.200
 "Oh, the Scottish surely drink more."

00:44:26.200 --> 00:44:29.680
 73 million bottles are sold domestically in the UK each year.

00:44:29.680 --> 00:44:32.480
 So even if every single UK bottle of whiskey

00:44:32.480 --> 00:44:34.240
 was sold in Scotland,

00:44:34.240 --> 00:44:36.600
 they'd only just be drinking as much whiskey

00:44:36.600 --> 00:44:38.480
 as the Singaporeans.

00:44:38.480 --> 00:44:40.840
 - And we know that Andy's having, you know?

00:44:40.840 --> 00:44:42.680
 - Andy's getting through.

00:44:42.680 --> 00:44:45.120
 - Working away on my famous grass, yeah.

00:44:45.120 --> 00:44:46.960
 - I've still got a bottle of whiskey in my house

00:44:46.960 --> 00:44:49.320
 that I bought on my honeymoon, which was 12 years ago.

00:44:49.320 --> 00:44:50.160
 - Really?

00:44:50.160 --> 00:44:51.000
 - Thank you.

00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:52.240
 - Is that for aging purposes?

00:44:52.240 --> 00:44:53.080
 - No, we only,

00:44:53.080 --> 00:44:56.480
 I only use it for whiskey sauce on Burns Night once a year.

00:44:56.480 --> 00:45:00.000
 - Is it, it's not unbelievably delicious whiskey,

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:01.120
 is it that you're wasting on it?

00:45:01.120 --> 00:45:02.160
 - It's telescope, it's pretty good.

00:45:02.160 --> 00:45:03.000
 - Oh, really?

00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:04.320
 - Yeah.

00:45:04.320 --> 00:45:05.480
 - Okay, well, we're not contributing

00:45:05.480 --> 00:45:07.400
 to the English stats, obviously.

00:45:07.400 --> 00:45:08.680
 But it's weird.

00:45:08.680 --> 00:45:09.520
 I was looking it up.

00:45:09.520 --> 00:45:11.200
 Singaporeans very light drinkers.

00:45:11.200 --> 00:45:14.760
 They consume two litres of alcohol per person per year,

00:45:14.760 --> 00:45:19.400
 which is about five times less than we do as Brits.

00:45:19.400 --> 00:45:20.840
 And it seems to be,

00:45:20.840 --> 00:45:22.560
 when I was looking at like people talking about it,

00:45:22.560 --> 00:45:24.760
 Singaporeans talking about it, it is about investment.

00:45:24.760 --> 00:45:27.000
 And a lot of them are buying up whiskey now.

00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:28.360
 It's become a trendy thing.

00:45:28.360 --> 00:45:29.800
 It's a pretty wealthy country.

00:45:29.800 --> 00:45:31.600
 - Well, there's a lot of expats as well, so.

00:45:31.600 --> 00:45:33.560
 - Lots of expats, yeah, that's true.

00:45:33.560 --> 00:45:35.760
 - Who will skew the number of people and what they drink.

00:45:35.760 --> 00:45:37.560
 - If I go as a tourist to Singapore,

00:45:37.560 --> 00:45:38.920
 'cause I know it's a whiskey hub,

00:45:38.920 --> 00:45:40.600
 'cause then they've got lots of amazing whiskey

00:45:40.600 --> 00:45:42.120
 from around the world and whiskey shops and things,

00:45:42.120 --> 00:45:43.280
 and I buy a bottle there.

00:45:43.280 --> 00:45:44.480
 Does that count, do you think?

00:45:44.480 --> 00:45:46.360
 - A Judy Free Sitch, yeah.

00:45:46.360 --> 00:45:47.720
 - I've never been except, I think,

00:45:47.720 --> 00:45:49.440
 briefly to the airport once.

00:45:49.440 --> 00:45:50.960
 But it sounds like an amazing--

00:45:50.960 --> 00:45:52.600
 - The airport is nice, in fairness.

00:45:52.600 --> 00:45:54.320
 - And again, I didn't go specifically to--

00:45:54.320 --> 00:45:56.040
 (all laughing)

00:45:56.040 --> 00:45:57.160
 - I just went into Changi,

00:45:57.160 --> 00:46:00.320
 couple of glasses of whiskey, straight back out.

00:46:00.320 --> 00:46:02.040
 I'm half a glass of whiskey today.

00:46:02.040 --> 00:46:03.280
 I think that's a record.

00:46:03.280 --> 00:46:05.860
 (all laughing)

00:46:07.440 --> 00:46:09.080
 - But it's an amazingly weird place.

00:46:09.080 --> 00:46:10.200
 - It's cool, I've been.

00:46:10.200 --> 00:46:12.360
 - Yeah, yeah, I went a lot as a kid.

00:46:12.360 --> 00:46:14.200
 - I suppose it's not far from there.

00:46:14.200 --> 00:46:16.280
 So it's right at the bottom of Malaysia,

00:46:16.280 --> 00:46:18.480
 and it's much like Portsmouth in that it's an island,

00:46:18.480 --> 00:46:20.640
 but it's separated by a very narrow strip of water

00:46:20.640 --> 00:46:22.840
 from the rest of the mainland, as it were.

00:46:22.840 --> 00:46:23.840
 - Portsmouth, the south.

00:46:23.840 --> 00:46:25.920
 - It's the Portsmouth of the south.

00:46:25.920 --> 00:46:26.880
 - When you learn in Singapore,

00:46:26.880 --> 00:46:29.920
 there's a big banner that says much like Portsmouth, welcome.

00:46:29.920 --> 00:46:33.960
 - Here's another thing they drink there, Yakult.

00:46:33.960 --> 00:46:34.800
 - Oh yeah?

00:46:34.800 --> 00:46:38.680
 - So you know Yakult, that kind of little sort of yogurty drink

00:46:38.680 --> 00:46:40.640
 with probiotics in it.

00:46:40.640 --> 00:46:42.640
 Singapore is the only country in the world

00:46:42.640 --> 00:46:44.960
 that sells different flavors of Yakult.

00:46:44.960 --> 00:46:46.280
 - Is it?

00:46:46.280 --> 00:46:49.800
 - Interesting, so just a childhood thing,

00:46:49.800 --> 00:46:52.240
 Yakult was massive in my childhood in Hong Kong,

00:46:52.240 --> 00:46:55.280
 but I can't picture another flavor other than the basic.

00:46:55.280 --> 00:46:57.360
 - Well, honestly, they only do it in Singapore.

00:46:57.360 --> 00:46:59.640
 They also have the biggest serving size

00:46:59.640 --> 00:47:01.920
 of anywhere in the world, which is 100 milliliters.

00:47:01.920 --> 00:47:03.640
 Now you can get that one in Hong Kong as well.

00:47:03.640 --> 00:47:05.000
 You can get that in a few countries,

00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:06.160
 but you can't get it in the UK,

00:47:06.160 --> 00:47:07.520
 but you can get it in Singapore.

00:47:07.520 --> 00:47:09.160
 - You mean of spirits?

00:47:09.160 --> 00:47:10.000
 - No, sorry, of Yakult.

00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:10.840
 - Yakult.

00:47:10.840 --> 00:47:11.960
 - Yakult was the only Yakult.

00:47:11.960 --> 00:47:13.280
 - It's like a novelty Toblerone, right?

00:47:13.280 --> 00:47:14.120
 Like it's a--

00:47:14.120 --> 00:47:16.800
 - Yeah, and also in Singapore,

00:47:16.800 --> 00:47:18.000
 this is the only place they have it.

00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:20.960
 They have a Yakult home delivery service,

00:47:20.960 --> 00:47:23.480
 which started in 1986,

00:47:23.480 --> 00:47:26.120
 and they will bring you your Yakult to your door

00:47:26.120 --> 00:47:26.960
 if you want it.

00:47:26.960 --> 00:47:28.160
 - Jesus Christ.

00:47:28.160 --> 00:47:29.920
 Their gut health must be out of this world.

00:47:29.920 --> 00:47:32.480
 (all laughing)

00:47:32.480 --> 00:47:33.320
 - That's amazing.

00:47:33.320 --> 00:47:34.840
 - Isn't that weird?

00:47:34.840 --> 00:47:35.880
 - 'Cause it's an island.

00:47:35.880 --> 00:47:37.440
 It's got this kind of island culture,

00:47:37.440 --> 00:47:39.040
 you know, where just things are popular there

00:47:39.040 --> 00:47:39.960
 that aren't popular anywhere else.

00:47:39.960 --> 00:47:43.560
 Like they've got the world's first ever salmon ATM there.

00:47:43.560 --> 00:47:44.760
 - Okay, yeah.

00:47:44.760 --> 00:47:45.840
 - It's a vending machine.

00:47:45.840 --> 00:47:47.320
 In fact, there are dozens of vending machines

00:47:47.320 --> 00:47:49.120
 specifically for Norwegian salmon.

00:47:49.120 --> 00:47:50.880
 - But the salmon always try and swim back

00:47:50.880 --> 00:47:52.120
 into the vending machine.

00:47:52.120 --> 00:47:54.800
 (all laughing)

00:47:54.800 --> 00:47:55.640
 - Yeah, it's bizarre.

00:47:55.640 --> 00:47:59.000
 Norwegian salmon, there were 61 as of 2019,

00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:01.240
 but it stays fresh in there for two years.

00:48:01.240 --> 00:48:02.080
 - Salmon?

00:48:02.080 --> 00:48:02.920
 - 'Cause it's frozen.

00:48:02.920 --> 00:48:03.760
 - Oh, okay.

00:48:03.760 --> 00:48:04.600
 - Oh, you know.

00:48:04.600 --> 00:48:05.440
 - Okay.

00:48:05.440 --> 00:48:07.400
 - Like Singapore, when you go there,

00:48:07.400 --> 00:48:09.680
 and this is again from the viewpoint of a kid,

00:48:09.680 --> 00:48:11.040
 it's not particularly weird.

00:48:11.040 --> 00:48:13.960
 It was a bit intimidating because of the rules.

00:48:13.960 --> 00:48:16.800
 You were always told, can't chew gum there.

00:48:16.800 --> 00:48:17.760
 That's illegal.

00:48:17.760 --> 00:48:19.680
 You will be lashed if you chew gum.

00:48:19.680 --> 00:48:21.040
 - I remember the teller of that.

00:48:21.040 --> 00:48:22.600
 - Yeah, I remember every time I would go there,

00:48:22.600 --> 00:48:24.360
 just being like, wow, it's so clean here.

00:48:24.360 --> 00:48:25.560
 And yeah, there's a reason for that.

00:48:25.560 --> 00:48:26.920
 - I've just realized,

00:48:26.920 --> 00:48:28.560
 'cause I remember thinking that as well,

00:48:28.560 --> 00:48:30.240
 but maybe I misunderstood,

00:48:30.240 --> 00:48:32.200
 'cause if they're all drinking so much Scotch,

00:48:32.200 --> 00:48:34.600
 and they're all getting lashed every day.

00:48:34.600 --> 00:48:37.200
 (all laughing)

00:48:37.200 --> 00:48:38.760
 Maybe that's what it meant all along.

00:48:38.760 --> 00:48:41.040
 - Yeah, no, it is pretty wild.

00:48:41.040 --> 00:48:42.240
 I was surprised actually,

00:48:42.240 --> 00:48:44.800
 that the number one imported drink isn't gin.

00:48:44.800 --> 00:48:47.320
 That's just because simply of the Singapore Sling,

00:48:47.320 --> 00:48:50.000
 the most famous drink to have the name Singapore

00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:51.560
 in front of it.

00:48:51.560 --> 00:48:53.080
 - What's the second most famous?

00:48:53.080 --> 00:48:54.680
 - There are no others, so yeah.

00:48:54.680 --> 00:48:56.960
 But that is a massive drink there.

00:48:56.960 --> 00:48:59.560
 It was invented in Raffles, the hotel,

00:48:59.560 --> 00:49:01.800
 which is an extraordinary hotel.

00:49:01.800 --> 00:49:03.680
 I don't know if you've ever seen pictures of it.

00:49:03.680 --> 00:49:04.520
 But you've been to Raffles.

00:49:04.520 --> 00:49:06.080
 - In fact, I've had a Singapore Sling there.

00:49:06.080 --> 00:49:06.920
 - Have you?

00:49:06.920 --> 00:49:07.920
 So yeah, they say they, at the bar,

00:49:07.920 --> 00:49:09.200
 which is called the Long Bar,

00:49:09.200 --> 00:49:11.960
 they say that about 2,000 Singapore Slings

00:49:11.960 --> 00:49:13.240
 are made per day.

00:49:13.240 --> 00:49:15.840
 - I gotta say, I ordered one, had a sip,

00:49:15.840 --> 00:49:17.280
 and then ordered a beer.

00:49:17.280 --> 00:49:18.120
 - Right, really?

00:49:18.120 --> 00:49:18.960
 - I did not like it at all.

00:49:18.960 --> 00:49:19.800
 - 'Cause you didn't like it?

00:49:19.800 --> 00:49:20.640
 - Yeah, it's too sweet and sour.

00:49:20.640 --> 00:49:22.200
 - Yeah, it was basically invented

00:49:22.200 --> 00:49:23.680
 by one of the bar staff there,

00:49:23.680 --> 00:49:26.840
 because women were not really allowed to drink publicly.

00:49:26.840 --> 00:49:29.920
 And so you make this with pineapple and lime,

00:49:29.920 --> 00:49:31.080
 and you put the gin in,

00:49:31.080 --> 00:49:32.920
 but it looks like they're just having a nice fresh juice.

00:49:32.920 --> 00:49:34.920
 And so that's kind of how it kicked off.

00:49:34.920 --> 00:49:36.760
 James, when you went to that bar,

00:49:36.760 --> 00:49:38.440
 did you notice as you walk

00:49:38.440 --> 00:49:41.400
 that your feet were crunching everywhere on shells?

00:49:41.400 --> 00:49:42.960
 - Some classy shells?

00:49:42.960 --> 00:49:43.800
 - No.

00:49:43.800 --> 00:49:44.760
 - I don't recall that.

00:49:44.760 --> 00:49:46.560
 I don't remember it very well, to be honest,

00:49:46.560 --> 00:49:47.880
 'cause it was quite a lot of years ago,

00:49:47.880 --> 00:49:49.280
 but no, I don't think so.

00:49:49.280 --> 00:49:50.880
 I remember it being very colonial.

00:49:50.880 --> 00:49:52.680
 - Right, so they have peanuts there

00:49:52.680 --> 00:49:54.000
 that they give to you in bags,

00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:55.560
 but they don't give you a plate to put the shells on,

00:49:55.560 --> 00:49:57.400
 because it is tradition to throw them on the floor

00:49:57.400 --> 00:49:58.920
 immediately after you've eaten them.

00:49:58.920 --> 00:49:59.760
 - Oh, really?

00:49:59.760 --> 00:50:01.480
 - At the end of the day, they just have to sweep up

00:50:01.480 --> 00:50:04.040
 all the discarded shells that are sitting there.

00:50:04.040 --> 00:50:05.000
 - Nice for the cleaning staff.

00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:06.440
 Do they appreciate that tradition?

00:50:06.440 --> 00:50:08.480
 All those migrant laborer cleaning staff?

00:50:08.480 --> 00:50:10.560
 - It's part of it, yeah.

00:50:10.560 --> 00:50:12.160
 And also, here's a really interesting fact.

00:50:12.160 --> 00:50:14.760
 It is located on number one beach road.

00:50:14.760 --> 00:50:17.960
 However, there is no beach near it.

00:50:17.960 --> 00:50:19.880
 Riddle me this.

00:50:19.880 --> 00:50:22.240
 - Did there used to be a beach near it?

00:50:22.240 --> 00:50:25.040
 - There used to be, and there's so much reclaimed land.

00:50:25.040 --> 00:50:27.800
 - Oh, it wasn't named after Dylan Thomas's wife,

00:50:27.800 --> 00:50:29.400
 he was a nymphomaniac and a beach.

00:50:29.400 --> 00:50:31.160
 (all laughing)

00:50:31.160 --> 00:50:32.400
 - First class beach on that.

00:50:32.400 --> 00:50:34.880
 (all laughing)

00:50:34.880 --> 00:50:35.720
 - There's that wild.

00:50:35.720 --> 00:50:37.120
 There used to be a beach right at the edge of it.

00:50:37.120 --> 00:50:40.440
 It's on beach road and so much land has been added

00:50:40.440 --> 00:50:41.760
 that it's no longer in sight.

00:50:41.760 --> 00:50:45.920
 - And Singapore is 20% larger than it was in the '60s.

00:50:45.920 --> 00:50:49.840
 And it's basically taken the land from Malaysia and Indonesia,

00:50:49.840 --> 00:50:51.840
 which you would think sounds like a war,

00:50:51.840 --> 00:50:55.000
 but they've not gone to war and taken the land in that way.

00:50:55.000 --> 00:50:57.360
 They've gone over there, taken all the sand,

00:50:57.360 --> 00:51:00.620
 and then created new land in Singapore.

00:51:00.620 --> 00:51:02.520
 So the sand comes from different countries.

00:51:02.520 --> 00:51:05.560
 It's Malaysian land, it's Indonesian sand,

00:51:05.560 --> 00:51:07.920
 but it's made Singapore 20% larger.

00:51:07.920 --> 00:51:09.800
 - And it's very controversial 'cause it's drained,

00:51:09.800 --> 00:51:11.240
 like they've banned it in Indonesia,

00:51:11.240 --> 00:51:12.440
 they banned it a while ago.

00:51:12.440 --> 00:51:14.200
 They've officially, I think almost all of it comes

00:51:14.200 --> 00:51:16.760
 from Cambodia now because it got banned elsewhere.

00:51:16.760 --> 00:51:19.200
 Cambodia banned it, but you can still make a huge amount

00:51:19.200 --> 00:51:21.920
 of money as a Cambodian who's willing to get your sacks out

00:51:21.920 --> 00:51:24.220
 and collect loads of sand and export it.

00:51:24.220 --> 00:51:25.560
 - Sounds muggling, yeah.

00:51:25.560 --> 00:51:26.720
 - 'Cause it is, I think a lot of stuff

00:51:26.720 --> 00:51:28.720
 about Singapore is to do with the fact it's so small.

00:51:28.720 --> 00:51:30.140
 And they import so much of their food

00:51:30.140 --> 00:51:32.460
 that they have to have innovative solutions

00:51:32.460 --> 00:51:35.640
 for feeding themselves and supplying their own stuff.

00:51:35.640 --> 00:51:37.240
 - And they've smashed that.

00:51:37.240 --> 00:51:38.480
 It was always the chart when I went,

00:51:38.480 --> 00:51:40.520
 I mean, which it was 20 years ago, but I think it's the same.

00:51:40.520 --> 00:51:43.080
 The only two things people ever told you about Singapore

00:51:43.080 --> 00:51:45.320
 and no offense to Singaporeans, I know there's more,

00:51:45.320 --> 00:51:48.440
 but the airport's amazing and the food's incredible.

00:51:48.440 --> 00:51:49.960
 And actually, when you live for three days,

00:51:49.960 --> 00:51:52.400
 once you know the food is the only thing really to do there,

00:51:52.400 --> 00:51:55.160
 once you've had kind of four meals in a row,

00:51:55.160 --> 00:51:57.440
 it's like, "Well, I can't enjoy this anymore.

00:51:57.440 --> 00:51:58.440
 What am I gonna do now?"

00:51:58.440 --> 00:51:59.600
 - How can you stop enjoying food?

00:51:59.600 --> 00:52:01.320
 - I've had them within about two hours.

00:52:01.320 --> 00:52:04.320
 He's just gone round stuffing your face.

00:52:04.320 --> 00:52:05.880
 - Actually, I just thought of something

00:52:05.880 --> 00:52:09.900
 that they did in Singapore that's like the NFL stuff,

00:52:09.900 --> 00:52:14.080
 which is they turn the car parks into like food halls.

00:52:14.080 --> 00:52:14.920
 - Oh, really?

00:52:14.920 --> 00:52:15.760
 - I'm sure they do that.

00:52:15.760 --> 00:52:17.800
 Yeah, I remember going to, it was like an old car park.

00:52:17.800 --> 00:52:20.600
 Once the car park closed and all the cars had gone,

00:52:20.600 --> 00:52:24.400
 suddenly it just opens up and they sell durian and--

00:52:24.400 --> 00:52:25.640
 - Yeah, okay, that sounds likely.

00:52:25.640 --> 00:52:26.480
 - That's the big thing, isn't it?

00:52:26.480 --> 00:52:27.320
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:52:27.320 --> 00:52:29.400
 - There's like one huge food hall.

00:52:29.400 --> 00:52:32.600
 - Graves, 'cause there's so little space going.

00:52:32.600 --> 00:52:34.800
 - They have to be all shaped like bananas

00:52:34.800 --> 00:52:37.520
 and they kind of tessellate with each other, don't they?

00:52:37.520 --> 00:52:39.120
 - They're all spooning.

00:52:39.120 --> 00:52:40.240
 - Oh, sweet.

00:52:40.240 --> 00:52:41.920
 - No, you get, they're digging up,

00:52:41.920 --> 00:52:43.560
 there used to be a couple of hundred cemeteries

00:52:43.560 --> 00:52:45.760
 in Singapore, now there are only about 60 left,

00:52:45.760 --> 00:52:47.080
 because they just need space.

00:52:47.080 --> 00:52:49.240
 You get 15 years only in the ground

00:52:49.240 --> 00:52:52.080
 if you choose to be buried and then you have to go elsewhere.

00:52:52.080 --> 00:52:53.600
 - Obviously, as we've said,

00:52:53.600 --> 00:52:55.440
 they're kind of big on their rules

00:52:55.440 --> 00:52:59.040
 and trying to stop people from doing certain things.

00:52:59.040 --> 00:53:02.640
 There was an anti-gambling advert in 2014

00:53:02.640 --> 00:53:05.160
 and this featured a little boy called Andy

00:53:05.160 --> 00:53:06.920
 and he was complaining to his friends

00:53:06.920 --> 00:53:09.360
 that his dad had bet his life savings

00:53:09.360 --> 00:53:11.520
 on Germany winning the World Cup

00:53:11.520 --> 00:53:14.520
 and Germany then won the 2014 World Cup.

00:53:14.520 --> 00:53:17.100
 (all laughing)

00:53:17.100 --> 00:53:22.120
 And the National Council on Problem Gambling said

00:53:22.120 --> 00:53:23.920
 that they decided to choose Germany

00:53:23.920 --> 00:53:25.880
 because they thought they were very unlikely to win,

00:53:25.880 --> 00:53:28.200
 but at least it would be realistic.

00:53:28.200 --> 00:53:30.200
 - You can never bet against the Germans in a World Cup.

00:53:30.200 --> 00:53:32.080
 - Exactly, they should have known.

00:53:32.080 --> 00:53:33.280
 But obviously everyone thought

00:53:33.280 --> 00:53:36.360
 that this was encouraging people to gamble.

00:53:36.360 --> 00:53:38.120
 So the council revamped the advert

00:53:38.120 --> 00:53:41.160
 and Andy, the little boy says, his friend asks,

00:53:41.160 --> 00:53:43.400
 "Your dad's team won, did you get your money back?"

00:53:43.400 --> 00:53:45.160
 And he said, "No, dad never stops,

00:53:45.160 --> 00:53:47.720
 he wants to bet one more time,"

00:53:47.720 --> 00:53:49.560
 on which he bet on Leicester winning

00:53:49.560 --> 00:53:50.960
 the next year's Premier League.

00:53:50.960 --> 00:53:51.800
 (all laughing)

00:53:51.800 --> 00:53:52.640
 - No, he didn't.

00:53:52.640 --> 00:53:54.720
 (all laughing)

00:53:54.720 --> 00:53:55.560
 - That's so funny.

00:53:55.560 --> 00:53:56.400
 Yeah, lots of things banned.

00:53:56.400 --> 00:53:58.000
 That's the only thing I know.

00:53:58.000 --> 00:53:59.760
 Chewing gum, I know, obviously.

00:53:59.760 --> 00:54:02.120
 But I mean, it's pretty draconian there, isn't it?

00:54:02.120 --> 00:54:05.280
 So you can still be caned if you're a man under the age of 50.

00:54:05.280 --> 00:54:06.880
 - Another euphemism for getting drunk.

00:54:06.880 --> 00:54:08.360
 - Oh no, yeah, you're right.

00:54:08.360 --> 00:54:09.960
 But you can really, like, they have a cane

00:54:09.960 --> 00:54:12.920
 and they will, and it's sort of minor levels of crime,

00:54:12.920 --> 00:54:14.400
 but it's really painful.

00:54:14.400 --> 00:54:15.360
 Like, it's really bad.

00:54:15.360 --> 00:54:16.200
 And there are all sorts of rumours

00:54:16.200 --> 00:54:17.960
 about the procedure, it just, it's just--

00:54:17.960 --> 00:54:20.520
 - I thought that J-Walking could get you caned,

00:54:20.520 --> 00:54:22.400
 like, is what I thought when I went there.

00:54:22.400 --> 00:54:23.880
 I don't know if it was true, but--

00:54:23.880 --> 00:54:26.520
 - Mine of vandalism does.

00:54:26.520 --> 00:54:28.400
 - Weeing in a lift, Dan, you were there as a child,

00:54:28.400 --> 00:54:29.560
 did you say?

00:54:29.560 --> 00:54:32.840
 - Not at that age, but yeah.

00:54:32.840 --> 00:54:33.920
 - 'Cause they had a huge problem

00:54:33.920 --> 00:54:35.000
 with people weeing in the lift.

00:54:35.000 --> 00:54:35.840
 - Sorry, sorry.

00:54:35.840 --> 00:54:38.000
 At what age did you stop weeing in the lift, Dan?

00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:39.600
 (all laughing)

00:54:39.600 --> 00:54:40.800
 - Like 23.

00:54:40.800 --> 00:54:42.760
 (all laughing)

00:54:42.760 --> 00:54:44.120
 - You're Dylan Thomas' face.

00:54:44.120 --> 00:54:46.760
 (all laughing)

00:54:46.760 --> 00:54:48.560
 - Yeah, 'cause everyone lives in high-rise buildings,

00:54:48.560 --> 00:54:50.160
 and in the '60s and '70s,

00:54:50.160 --> 00:54:53.440
 every lift stank of piss, and it was horrible,

00:54:53.440 --> 00:54:55.600
 and they had suggestions of how do we combat this,

00:54:55.600 --> 00:54:57.400
 'cause it's a really nasty social problem.

00:54:57.400 --> 00:54:59.640
 One block of flats just bought its own lift attendant,

00:54:59.640 --> 00:55:00.880
 like everyone chipped in,

00:55:00.880 --> 00:55:02.600
 and you'd have someone to, you know, press the buttons,

00:55:02.600 --> 00:55:04.440
 but also stop anyone weeing.

00:55:04.440 --> 00:55:07.800
 And eventually, in the 1988 war on piss,

00:55:07.800 --> 00:55:11.680
 they installed urine detectors in lifts,

00:55:11.680 --> 00:55:12.880
 and had a crack down,

00:55:12.880 --> 00:55:15.040
 and if a drop of weed hits the floor,

00:55:15.040 --> 00:55:16.760
 that urine detector detects it,

00:55:16.760 --> 00:55:18.960
 the lift slams to a halt,

00:55:18.960 --> 00:55:21.560
 and you have to wait there until the authorities come

00:55:21.560 --> 00:55:23.000
 and drag you off to Chokey.

00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:24.280
 - Oh my God.

00:55:24.280 --> 00:55:25.520
 - And the first people calling for it,

00:55:25.520 --> 00:55:27.600
 were I think, you know, boys who were just sort of...

00:55:27.600 --> 00:55:30.360
 - I wanna know, 'cause they had this problem

00:55:30.360 --> 00:55:33.480
 in other countries that most people live in high-rise.

00:55:33.480 --> 00:55:36.520
 You're so close to home when you're in a lift.

00:55:36.520 --> 00:55:37.520
 - What if you're going out?

00:55:37.520 --> 00:55:39.520
 (all laughing)

00:55:39.520 --> 00:55:42.880
 - It feels like go before you leave, right?

00:55:42.880 --> 00:55:44.680
 It just feels like you're so close

00:55:44.680 --> 00:55:47.280
 to having either just left your toilet,

00:55:47.280 --> 00:55:48.920
 or just arriving at your toilet.

00:55:48.920 --> 00:55:50.040
 - But you know what it's like.

00:55:50.040 --> 00:55:51.400
 When you really need the loo,

00:55:51.400 --> 00:55:52.760
 you suddenly can't hold it anymore

00:55:52.760 --> 00:55:54.520
 when you're 10 yards from your front door, right?

00:55:54.520 --> 00:55:55.880
 - Yeah, you let your guard down a bit, and then...

00:55:55.880 --> 00:55:57.400
 - Exactly, you relax.

00:55:57.400 --> 00:55:59.680
 - I don't think it's people who are incapable.

00:55:59.680 --> 00:56:01.000
 I don't think it's people who are almost home

00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:02.240
 who just can't hold it anymore.

00:56:02.240 --> 00:56:03.320
 I think it was just a...

00:56:03.320 --> 00:56:05.160
 I don't know, if I was visiting your home though, James,

00:56:05.160 --> 00:56:06.760
 I might we in the lift on the way up

00:56:06.760 --> 00:56:08.640
 just to kind of mark the territory.

00:56:08.640 --> 00:56:10.160
 - Why don't I live in a ground floor flat?

00:56:10.160 --> 00:56:12.400
 (all laughing)

00:56:12.400 --> 00:56:15.360
 - Through the front window, or whatever it might be.

00:56:15.360 --> 00:56:17.940
 (upbeat music)

00:56:18.460 --> 00:56:20.780
 (upbeat music)

00:56:20.780 --> 00:56:21.620
 - Okay, that's it.

00:56:21.620 --> 00:56:22.620
 That is all of our facts.

00:56:22.620 --> 00:56:24.060
