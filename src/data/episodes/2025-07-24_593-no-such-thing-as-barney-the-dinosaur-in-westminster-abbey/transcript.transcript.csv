00:00:03,00:00:06,"Hi everybody, it's Andy and James here from No Such Thing as a Fish."
00:00:06,00:00:07,"Hi, your favourite too."
00:00:07,00:00:09,[Laughs]
00:00:09,00:00:10,Shhh.
00:00:10,00:00:11,"But, yes."
00:00:11,00:00:13,Now we're here with a little topper show announcement
00:00:13,00:00:16,because we've got some secret juicy gossip for you.
00:00:16,00:00:17,We sure have.
00:00:17,00:00:20,And that gossip is that we are going to be doing some live shows.
00:00:20,00:00:22,You didn't hear it from us.
00:00:22,00:00:25,But if you go to King's Place in London
00:00:25,00:00:27,"on the 5th and 6th of September,"
00:00:27,00:00:30,"you can see not one, but two No Such Thing as a Fish live shows."
00:00:30,00:00:32,Dan and Anna will also be there for clarity.
00:00:32,00:00:33,Anna will not be there for clarity.
00:00:33,00:00:35,"Yeah, sorry, yeah."
00:00:35,00:00:36,Dan will be.
00:00:36,00:00:38,"And some very, very special guests."
00:00:38,00:00:41,"Now, we have already booked one of these special guests"
00:00:41,00:00:45,"and I promise you, if I mentioned the name of that person right now,"
00:00:45,00:00:47,we would sell out in seconds.
00:00:47,00:00:47,That's right.
00:00:47,00:00:51,"And if it does sell out, there are streaming tickets available too."
00:00:51,00:00:52,You can watch the show live.
00:00:52,00:00:56,See what it's like when we're not rigorously and scrupulously edited.
00:00:56,00:01:00,"Here, all the stuff we say that really should be edited out"
00:01:00,00:01:02,by getting a streaming ticket.
00:01:02,00:01:04,"And where do you get those tickets from, Andy?"
00:01:04,00:01:06,"I think if they just go to our website, there'll be a link."
00:01:06,00:01:08,No such thing as a fish.com.
00:01:08,00:01:08,Excellent.
00:01:08,00:01:10,"Well, do that right now."
00:01:10,00:01:12,"But in the meantime, it's time to say,"
00:01:12,00:01:14,"on with the podcast, on with the show."
00:01:14,00:01:38,"Hello and welcome to another episode of no such thing as a fish,"
00:01:38,00:01:42,a weekly podcast coming to you from the QI offices in Hoburn.
00:01:42,00:01:43,My name is Dan Schreiber.
00:01:43,00:01:47,"I am sitting here with James Harkin, Andrew Hunter Murray,"
00:01:47,00:01:48,and Anna Tyshinski.
00:01:48,00:01:50,"And once again, we have gathered around the microphones"
00:01:50,00:01:52,with our four favorite facts from the last seven days.
00:01:52,00:01:56,"And in no particular order, here we go."
00:01:56,00:01:59,"Starting with fact number one, and that is my fact."
00:01:59,00:02:01,"My fact this week is that before he was buried,"
00:02:01,00:02:06,the poet Dylan Thomas was used as a poker table.
00:02:06,00:02:08,That doesn't feel very practical.
00:02:08,00:02:09,No.
00:02:09,00:02:11,The chicks are going to go everywhere.
00:02:11,00:02:12,"And I imagine as a poet, you're wearing"
00:02:12,00:02:15,"a lot of ruffles, maybe a cravat."
00:02:15,00:02:17,"You know, you're not going to be a smooth table."
00:02:17,00:02:18,No. OK.
00:02:18,00:02:21,So it's not his body that was physically used as the poker
00:02:21,00:02:25,"table. Dylan Thomas, as a bit of backstory, had been in America"
00:02:25,00:02:28,"and he died on the 9th of November, 1953."
00:02:28,00:02:31,"Let's get right to the, let's cut to the chase."
00:02:31,00:02:32,Was he born before he died?
00:02:32,00:02:34,"I need to know all the context, Dan."
00:02:34,00:02:36,"So yeah, it was really unfortunate."
00:02:36,00:02:37,He was 39 years old.
00:02:37,00:02:38,He was a big drinker.
00:02:38,00:02:40,There's a bit of mystery about what actually caused his death.
00:02:40,00:02:42,"But there we have it, the facts."
00:02:42,00:02:44,"He dies November, 1953."
00:02:44,00:02:47,"His wife, Caitlin, decides she doesn't want him to be buried"
00:02:47,00:02:48,in America.
00:02:48,00:02:51,"She wants to bring him back home to Wales, his home country."
00:02:51,00:02:51,Yeah.
00:02:51,00:02:54,And so she puts him on a ship and he's in the hold.
00:02:54,00:02:57,And one night she's a bit disruptive upstairs
00:02:57,00:02:58,and she gets sent downstairs.
00:02:58,00:02:59,And it just so happens that she's
00:02:59,00:03:02,bunking up very near to his coffin.
00:03:02,00:03:04,And she notices that all the sailors gather around the coffin
00:03:04,00:03:06,and use it as the poker table.
00:03:06,00:03:09,And she thought he would have loved this.
00:03:09,00:03:09,Yeah.
00:03:09,00:03:12,So was it not obviously a coffin?
00:03:12,00:03:12,I think it might have been.
00:03:12,00:03:15,They might not have cared.
00:03:15,00:03:17,That's quite a macabre.
00:03:17,00:03:19,I would have tried to find another table
00:03:19,00:03:20,or just a packing crate or something.
00:03:20,00:03:21,Would you?
00:03:21,00:03:22,I would have gone out my way to find the coffin.
00:03:22,00:03:22,Yeah.
00:03:22,00:03:24,If you had there's a coffin on board.
00:03:24,00:03:27,"I genuinely think when I go, if I could organize it"
00:03:27,00:03:30,that my mates had a poker game on my coffin
00:03:30,00:03:32,"and they didn't mind, then I'd be down for that."
00:03:32,00:03:34,"It would be more golf for you, though, wouldn't it?"
00:03:34,00:03:36,That's hard to play in a coffin.
00:03:36,00:03:38,Right.
00:03:38,00:03:39,You could be the last hole.
00:03:39,00:03:42,The 19th hole.
00:03:42,00:03:45,"I'm hoping that I'm laid down face up, actually."
00:03:45,00:03:52,"Apparently, like you said, there was some ruckus with Caitlyn."
00:03:52,00:03:56,"I read that she was in a cabin with, and I quote,"
00:03:56,00:04:00,some sort of glamor queen that she really didn't like.
00:04:00,00:04:02,And so she deliberately caused a ruckus
00:04:02,00:04:04,so that she would get kicked out of that cabin.
00:04:04,00:04:05,Yeah.
00:04:05,00:04:07,"Yeah, having now read up about Caitlyn,"
00:04:07,00:04:10,I wonder if that's true or if she was just generally causing
00:04:10,00:04:12,"ruckus, because that was the thing about them."
00:04:12,00:04:14,They were sort of described as the prototype
00:04:14,00:04:16,Sid and Nancy of the sex pistols.
00:04:16,00:04:18,They were a couple that were destructive.
00:04:18,00:04:19,They'd get huge fights.
00:04:19,00:04:21,They would get drunk everywhere they went.
00:04:21,00:04:23,"But what's crazy is that when Caitlyn got back,"
00:04:23,00:04:26,she went on a pub crawl with the person who picked her up.
00:04:26,00:04:29,And Dylan was just left in the car park in the coffin
00:04:29,00:04:32,while they were getting pissed along the way in all the pubs
00:04:32,00:04:34,towards where his home was going to be.
00:04:34,00:04:35,Yeah.
00:04:35,00:04:39,Did you find the claim that he was buried in a banana-shaped
00:04:39,00:04:41,grave?
00:04:41,00:04:43,No.
00:04:43,00:04:44,No.
00:04:44,00:04:46,"OK, so we should say, also, most famous Welsh poet,"
00:04:46,00:04:48,"arguably, I'd say, ever?"
00:04:48,00:04:49,"For me, he is."
00:04:49,00:04:51,"I mean, he's barred territory."
00:04:51,00:04:53,"If someone asked me the name of a Welsh poet,"
00:04:53,00:04:54,he would be the one.
00:04:54,00:04:55,Exactly.
00:04:55,00:04:58,And he certainly was barred from most of his local pubs.
00:04:58,00:05:02,"Well, there is a claim, I read, that the grave digger was"
00:05:02,00:05:05,"Defan Mute, and he only knew that he was burying a man whose"
00:05:05,00:05:07,favorite fruit was the banana.
00:05:07,00:05:11,"So in tribute, he originally dug a banana-shaped grave"
00:05:11,00:05:13,before being told off and told the grave digger.
00:05:13,00:05:15,"Now, I just think if you're a professional grave digger,"
00:05:15,00:05:18,you know that you very rarely get a banana-shaped coffin.
00:05:18,00:05:19,Yeah.
00:05:19,00:05:21,Do we know that his favorite fruit was banana?
00:05:21,00:05:24,"Do you know, the original thing is so untrue that I haven't"
00:05:24,00:05:28,even saw that yet.
00:05:28,00:05:30,I thought Defan Mute sounds like a Welsh name.
00:05:30,00:05:33,I thought that was a name.
00:05:33,00:05:36,"So his death, Dan, you said that there was some weird things"
00:05:36,00:05:37,about that.
00:05:37,00:05:37,Yeah.
00:05:37,00:05:42,There was the idea that he drank so much that the night
00:05:42,00:05:45,"before he went into a coma, which then led to him going"
00:05:45,00:05:47,"to hospital and eventually dying,"
00:05:47,00:05:51,he claimed to have drunk 18 whiskeys.
00:05:51,00:05:53,"Also the line, say the line."
00:05:53,00:05:56,"Supposedly his last words were, I've just drunk 18"
00:05:56,00:05:57,straight whiskeys.
00:05:57,00:05:59,I think that's a record or something like that.
00:05:59,00:06:00,That's a great line.
00:06:00,00:06:01,"But that's not true, is it?"
00:06:01,00:06:04,He definitely said things after that.
00:06:04,00:06:06,"I think he did say that, actually, in fairness."
00:06:06,00:06:09,"But it was the day before and then the next day,"
00:06:09,00:06:12,he did talk to people and said different things.
00:06:12,00:06:15,"He said, God, kill for a banana right now."
00:06:15,00:06:17,"So it was the doctor's fault, right?"
00:06:17,00:06:21,"So yeah, so he was sedated with some morphine."
00:06:21,00:06:22,And he went into a coma.
00:06:22,00:06:24,"And he had pneumonia, which hadn't been diagnosed."
00:06:24,00:06:25,And that was the problem with the morphine.
00:06:25,00:06:27,But this is the interesting thing.
00:06:27,00:06:28,I think it's actually Dylan Thomas' fault.
00:06:28,00:06:30,Because he did make that joke about having
00:06:30,00:06:32,"had all these whiskeys, right?"
00:06:32,00:06:35,"And then I believe his friend who'd overheard that,"
00:06:35,00:06:37,"when he was really ill, said to the doctor,"
00:06:37,00:06:39,"oh, well, he told me yesterday he'd had 18 straight whiskeys."
00:06:39,00:06:42,So the doctor very naturally assumes alcohol poisoning
00:06:42,00:06:44,"and then gives him the morphine,"
00:06:44,00:06:46,"which puts him into the coma, which kills him."
00:06:46,00:06:49,"So actually Dylan Thomas died of his own joke,"
00:06:49,00:06:51,as well as medical misdiagnosis and all of that.
00:06:51,00:06:53,"But basically it's because his friend said,"
00:06:53,00:06:54,"oh yeah, well, this is what he was saying."
00:06:54,00:06:56,"- Well, it's possible he wasn't joking though,"
00:06:56,00:06:58,because they went and interviewed the bartender
00:06:58,00:07:00,who was serving drinks at night.
00:07:00,00:07:03,"And he said he didn't drink 18, absolutely not."
00:07:03,00:07:06,But someone pointed out that a shot in America
00:07:06,00:07:08,versus a shot back home is three times the amount.
00:07:08,00:07:11,"So they think in his incredibly drunken state,"
00:07:11,00:07:14,Dylan Thomas was doing math and worked out
00:07:14,00:07:16,"how many that would have been back home, which was 18."
00:07:16,00:07:20,"- Yeah, in fairness, the math was only three times six."
00:07:20,00:07:22,- But once you've had 18 whiskeys.
00:07:22,00:07:27,- He actually wasn't good at taking his drink.
00:07:27,00:07:29,He's got this reputation for being such a heavy drinker.
00:07:29,00:07:31,"But I think people who knew him said actually,"
00:07:31,00:07:32,he was kind of a lightweight.
00:07:32,00:07:34,So maybe he just seemed pissed a lot.
00:07:34,00:07:37,"He had a famous sort of relationship slash,"
00:07:37,00:07:39,what's an enemy ship?
00:07:39,00:07:40,- Frenemy?
00:07:40,00:07:41,"- He was sort of a frenemy,"
00:07:41,00:07:44,"but without the fruit of it with Kingsley Amos,"
00:07:44,00:07:45,"who only met him once,"
00:07:45,00:07:48,but used to write really awful things about his poetry.
00:07:48,00:07:49,- Okay.
00:07:49,00:07:50,- And Amos met him in 1951.
00:07:50,00:07:53,And he said he was an outstandingly unpleasant man
00:07:53,00:07:55,who cheated and stole from his friends
00:07:55,00:07:56,and peed on their carpets.
00:07:56,00:07:59,And he boozed a lot because it fitted his image as a poet
00:07:59,00:08:02,rather than out of any thirst or need.
00:08:02,00:08:04,"- I think people, quite a lot of people"
00:08:04,00:08:06,"didn't really like him very much, even his friends."
00:08:06,00:08:09,"- No, it's a shame if you like his poetry to read up on him"
00:08:09,00:08:10,"because it makes him quite unlikable, doesn't it?"
00:08:10,00:08:12,"- I think he considered himself to be a poet,"
00:08:12,00:08:15,which meant he didn't need to get a proper job.
00:08:15,00:08:19,He could just sort of dilettantishly turn up at people's houses
00:08:19,00:08:22,and sleep on their sofas and urinate on their carpets.
00:08:22,00:08:24,"Perhaps, I don't know."
00:08:24,00:08:26,"But yeah, like one of his really good friends,"
00:08:26,00:08:29,"Norman Cameron, he wrote, ""Who invited him in?"
00:08:29,00:08:30,What was he doing here?
00:08:30,00:08:33,"That insolent little ruffian, that crappulous lout?"
00:08:33,00:08:36,"When he quitted a sofa, he left behind a smear."""
00:08:36,00:08:38,- Oh dear.
00:08:38,00:08:40,"- That's what his friends thought of him,"
00:08:40,00:08:41,what of his enemies.
00:08:41,00:08:43,"- Right, but his fans kind of loved it, right?"
00:08:43,00:08:46,They loved this image of a drunken poet
00:08:46,00:08:48,who was living up to that romantic idea
00:08:48,00:08:51,"that they're sitting in a shed with a glass of whiskey,"
00:08:51,00:08:52,writing these incredible lines.
00:08:52,00:08:55,"And in his final eight years, you know, he died 39,"
00:08:55,00:08:58,"as I said, in the final eight years, he wrote six poems."
00:08:58,00:09:00,He spent basically the last period of his life
00:09:00,00:09:03,going on tours and talking and reading out his poems.
00:09:03,00:09:06,He became an orator as opposed to a writer.
00:09:06,00:09:09,And people would go because it was quite rock and roll.
00:09:09,00:09:11,Is Dylan Thomas gonna swear at someone in the crowd?
00:09:11,00:09:14,Is he gonna drunkenly fall off the stage and pass out?
00:09:14,00:09:16,- Is he gonna leave a smear on the sofa?
00:09:16,00:09:17,(all laughing)
00:09:17,00:09:19,"- The curtain comes up and says,"
00:09:19,00:09:22,"""That's a sofa on the stage, get it Dylan!"""
00:09:22,00:09:25,"But he was kind of, you know, people were into that."
00:09:25,00:09:28,- I think he was less hard living in lots of ways.
00:09:28,00:09:31,So he lived for a while in a place called Lawn
00:09:31,00:09:34,"and the Thomas family GP, the doctor,"
00:09:34,00:09:36,wrote he didn't do any womanizing.
00:09:36,00:09:37,He was pretty sober.
00:09:37,00:09:40,He was very respectful.
00:09:40,00:09:41,He started the day by helping his dad
00:09:41,00:09:44,with the times crossword every morning.
00:09:44,00:09:46,"Apparently his capacity for drink, I'm quoting now,"
00:09:46,00:09:49,was very limited compared with the average hearty.
00:09:49,00:09:50,He couldn't drink very much.
00:09:50,00:09:52,Three or four pints was his absolute limit.
00:09:52,00:09:55,"But then of his wife, Caitlyn, the doctor wrote,"
00:09:55,00:09:58,"""Caitlyn is a nymphomaniac and the first class bitch."""
00:09:58,00:09:59,(all laughing)
00:09:59,00:10:01,- Is that a medical diagnosis back then?
00:10:01,00:10:06,She does seem a tough character.
00:10:06,00:10:07,But I really didn't know the thing
00:10:07,00:10:09,I found most unbelievable about him is
00:10:09,00:10:10,you say that he only wrote six poems
00:10:10,00:10:12,or whatever in his last seven years.
00:10:12,00:10:14,"Really, he wrote all of his best poetry pretty much."
00:10:14,00:10:16,Everyone agrees by the time he was 19.
00:10:16,00:10:18,Isn't that insane?
00:10:18,00:10:19,I was a child when I was 19.
00:10:19,00:10:21,"I was like, ""You're thinking such immature stuff."""
00:10:21,00:10:23,And that's why it's kind of nonsense.
00:10:23,00:10:25,I used to love him when I was a teenager
00:10:25,00:10:28,"because I thought, ""Well, this must mean something amazing."""
00:10:28,00:10:29,But it was really heartening to read
00:10:29,00:10:31,"all of these reviewers write about him and say,"
00:10:31,00:10:32,"""The words are beautiful,"
00:10:32,00:10:34,"""which is what's so fun about reading him,"
00:10:34,00:10:36,"""but no one knows what he's on about."""
00:10:36,00:10:38,"- He also, 'cause we were calling him a poet,"
00:10:38,00:10:40,but he also wrote some pretty seminal other pieces.
00:10:40,00:10:43,"Like he wrote ""Under Milkwood,"" which was a play"
00:10:43,00:10:45,which is still sort of known today.
00:10:45,00:10:46,- I did it at school.
00:10:46,00:10:47,- Did you really?
00:10:47,00:10:48,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:10:48,00:10:49,"- I think people do, don't they, ladies?"
00:10:49,00:10:50,- Who did you play?
00:10:50,00:10:53,"- Sorry, no, for my GCSE English, I had to learn it."
00:10:53,00:10:56,"- Okay, right, yeah, nice."
00:10:56,00:10:59,"- You played a tree, admit it, you were one of the trees."
00:10:59,00:11:01,- But there's a lot of milk under me.
00:11:01,00:11:07,- You guys know AJP Taylor?
00:11:07,00:11:08,- I only know the name as well.
00:11:08,00:11:10,"He was a really famous 20th century historian,"
00:11:10,00:11:13,like mega famous at a time when historians were rock stars.
00:11:14,00:11:19,"Anyway, Dylan Thomas befriended his wife, Margaret,"
00:11:19,00:11:22,and--
00:11:22,00:11:23,- Euphemism?
00:11:23,00:11:26,"- Well, she definitely had the hots for him."
00:11:26,00:11:29,And Dylan Thomas went to stay on the sofa
00:11:29,00:11:32,"and did a lot of, like he would stay for a month."
00:11:32,00:11:34,And AJP Taylor liked to keep a barrel of beer in the house.
00:11:34,00:11:36,That was just his nice thing.
00:11:36,00:11:38,But he hated having Dylan Thomas to stay
00:11:38,00:11:41,'cause he would drink supposedly 15 pints a day
00:11:41,00:11:44,and he'd constantly have to be replacing his barrel.
00:11:44,00:11:45,"And Taylor's wife, Margaret,"
00:11:45,00:11:48,fell absolutely besotted with Dylan Thomas.
00:11:48,00:11:49,She spent all her money on him.
00:11:49,00:11:51,She wrote him erotic letters.
00:11:51,00:11:53,She persuaded AJP Taylor to buy a house
00:11:53,00:11:56,"for 2,000 pounds for Dylan Thomas."
00:11:56,00:11:59,"And Taylor said, ""Okay, fine, if you stop giving him money,"""
00:11:59,00:12:00,which she did not.
00:12:00,00:12:02,And then she bought him another house.
00:12:02,00:12:04,- Jesus Christ.
00:12:04,00:12:06,- He does sound like a really annoying guy to have to stay.
00:12:06,00:12:07,- I read one anecdote about him.
00:12:07,00:12:10,He went out drinking with novelist Philip Lindsay
00:12:10,00:12:13,and got his penis stuck in a honeypot.
00:12:13,00:12:15,(all laughing)
00:12:15,00:12:17,- We need the poo take.
00:12:17,00:12:19,(all laughing)
00:12:19,00:12:22,- Great thing about this is in Andrew Lycet's biography
00:12:22,00:12:24,and it's kind of mostly there and not really anywhere else.
00:12:24,00:12:27,But it was from people who were there who said it happened.
00:12:27,00:12:29,But no one knows why he did that.
00:12:29,00:12:30,- No.
00:12:30,00:12:30,- Was it a honey trap?
00:12:30,00:12:33,(all laughing)
00:12:33,00:12:34,"- They said on the same occasion,"
00:12:34,00:12:37,he pushed a shirt button up his nose and couldn't get it out.
00:12:37,00:12:39,(all laughing)
00:12:39,00:12:41,"You go into the A and E and you're like,"
00:12:41,00:12:43,"""Yeah, is this button thing?"
00:12:43,00:12:45,"""Can you get the button thing out, please?"""
00:12:45,00:12:46,"""Sir, there appears to be something."""
00:12:46,00:12:47,"""No, no, just the button."""
00:12:47,00:12:48,(all laughing)
00:12:48,00:12:50,"- I actually haven't just said, ""Winnie the Pooh,"""
00:12:50,00:12:52,I only know Winnie the Pooh-sized honeypots.
00:12:52,00:12:54,Do they come smaller?
00:12:54,00:12:55,"- Wait, does Winnie the Pooh have massive honeypots?"
00:12:55,00:12:56,"- Yeah, his head gets stuck in them."
00:12:56,00:12:57,"- Oh, yeah."
00:12:57,00:12:59,Maybe Dylan Thomas was very well endowed
00:12:59,00:13:01,and that's what kept the women falling in.
00:13:01,00:13:02,"- But the shape of a honeypot is,"
00:13:02,00:13:05,"it expands as it gets towards the base, as it were."
00:13:05,00:13:07,It's not like a honey jar.
00:13:07,00:13:09,I could understand him getting his penis stuck in a honey jar.
00:13:09,00:13:11,- I was imagining a honey jar.
00:13:11,00:13:12,- It's a set honey or runny honey.
00:13:12,00:13:14,"- You know, when you go to a travel lodge"
00:13:14,00:13:16,and you get those tiny little jars of honey.
00:13:16,00:13:19,(all laughing)
00:13:19,00:13:20,- We're gonna have to ask you
00:13:20,00:13:21,to leave the breakfast buffet.
00:13:21,00:13:24,(all laughing)
00:13:24,00:13:27,- Everyone's got their own sized honeypot.
00:13:27,00:13:29,"Yeah, it's full of tantalising details about biography."
00:13:29,00:13:31,"It's amazing, 'cause he's spoken to everyone"
00:13:31,00:13:34,"who ever knew him, but people just give memories"
00:13:34,00:13:35,without elaboration.
00:13:35,00:13:37,"So there's those two, there's, on one occasion,"
00:13:37,00:13:39,he managed to stab himself in the eye
00:13:39,00:13:41,while eating a plate of meatballs.
00:13:41,00:13:43,"No, no further details."
00:13:43,00:13:44,How do you do that?
00:13:44,00:13:45,- How do you do that?
00:13:45,00:13:48,- And then someone else said there was a particular period
00:13:48,00:13:50,where he had to deal with his rubber fetishism.
00:13:50,00:13:51,No more on it.
00:13:51,00:13:53,"- That's it, that's it, that's all we get."
00:13:53,00:13:54,- What did he do with rubber?
00:13:54,00:13:56,"- Now, he's a very important poet."
00:13:56,00:14:00,"He is part of the poet's corner in Westminster Abbey,"
00:14:00,00:14:01,"which is reserved for some of the greats,"
00:14:01,00:14:03,it's Shakespeare and so on.
00:14:03,00:14:04,He originally wasn't in there.
00:14:04,00:14:06,"And it all comes down to Jimmy Carter,"
00:14:06,00:14:10,"President Jimmy Carter, who lobbied for him to be in there."
00:14:10,00:14:10,- Why?
00:14:10,00:14:12,- He loves him to the point where he went
00:14:12,00:14:15,to certain bits of Wales just to be around the area
00:14:15,00:14:17,that Dylan Thomas would have been in.
00:14:17,00:14:20,Even wrote a poem called A President Expresses Concern
00:14:20,00:14:23,on a visit to Westminster Abbey by Jimmy Carter.
00:14:23,00:14:23,- No way.
00:14:23,00:14:25,- Gosh.
00:14:25,00:14:27,"- That makes me like Dylan Thomas again,"
00:14:27,00:14:28,having just gone off him.
00:14:28,00:14:29,Jimmy Carter liked him.
00:14:29,00:14:31,"- Yeah, 'cause you're a massive Carter fan, yeah."
00:14:31,00:14:32,- Yeah.
00:14:32,00:14:33,"What a weird presidential, like,"
00:14:33,00:14:35,is that what happens on state visits?
00:14:35,00:14:37,- He campaigned a bit harder to get himself re-elected.
00:14:37,00:14:38,- Exactly.
00:14:38,00:14:39,"- Well, it happened in '82,"
00:14:39,00:14:41,"so maybe he worked on it post-presidency,"
00:14:41,00:14:43,"but it was on that trip that he said, ""Well, it was old."""
00:14:43,00:14:45,- I can imagine Donald Trump at the moment
00:14:45,00:14:47,is trying to get Barney the big purple dinosaur
00:14:47,00:14:48,in Westminster Abbey.
00:14:48,00:14:50,"- We'll do it, we'll do it."
00:14:50,00:14:55,"Lawn, this place where he lived,"
00:14:55,00:14:58,his local pub was a place called Brown's Hotel.
00:14:58,00:15:02,"It was bought recently by, guess who?"
00:15:02,00:15:03,- The game.
00:15:03,00:15:04,- The board makers.
00:15:04,00:15:05,- Sorry.
00:15:05,00:15:10,"- Okay, give us a clue."
00:15:10,00:15:11,"- What, the TV show?"
00:15:11,00:15:13,(laughing)
00:15:13,00:15:16,- Why in a two runny skirt?
00:15:16,00:15:19,(laughing)
00:15:19,00:15:22,"- No, what was Dylan Thomas?"
00:15:22,00:15:24,He was a man behaving badly.
00:15:24,00:15:25,- Yeah.
00:15:25,00:15:26,"- Oh, is it Martin Clues?"
00:15:26,00:15:27,- It was Neil Morrissey.
00:15:27,00:15:28,"- Oh, really?"
00:15:28,00:15:30,- The other man behaving badly bought his local.
00:15:30,00:15:31,- Really?
00:15:31,00:15:32,"- And Dylan Thomas was a man behaving badly,"
00:15:32,00:15:34,and Neil Morrissey for international business
00:15:34,00:15:37,was about 30 years ago
00:15:37,00:15:38,in a second club called Mem Haven Badly.
00:15:38,00:15:39,- Yeah.
00:15:39,00:15:40,- That's a great fact.
00:15:40,00:15:41,- That's a great fact.
00:15:41,00:15:43,(upbeat music)
00:15:43,00:15:47,"- Okay, it is time for fact number two,"
00:15:47,00:15:48,and that is Andy.
00:15:48,00:15:51,- My fact is that six out of 10 lakes are in Canada.
00:15:51,00:15:54,- That's amazing.
00:15:54,00:15:56,- Out of all the lakes in the world.
00:15:56,00:15:57,- That's wild.
00:15:57,00:15:58,- 60% are in Canada.
00:15:58,00:16:00,"- It's big, Canada."
00:16:00,00:16:02,"- It is big, but it's not 60% of the world's."
00:16:02,00:16:03,- No.
00:16:03,00:16:04,- It's a lamb ass.
00:16:04,00:16:05,It's a disproportionate number of lakes.
00:16:05,00:16:08,- So if you wake up after a big old
00:16:08,00:16:10,"Dylan Thomas-style bender,"
00:16:10,00:16:13,"and you look and there's a lake there,"
00:16:13,00:16:15,you're more likely than not in Canada.
00:16:15,00:16:16,- That's right.
00:16:16,00:16:17,- Yeah.
00:16:17,00:16:18,- That's right.
00:16:18,00:16:19,- Do we know how many and why?
00:16:19,00:16:20,- We do.
00:16:20,00:16:25,"900,000 and geology is the short."
00:16:25,00:16:26,- No further questions.
00:16:26,00:16:28,"- No, I got this on a great substrate"
00:16:28,00:16:30,by a guy called Thomas Pueyo.
00:16:30,00:16:32,"And basically, at the bottom, you've got the Great Lakes,"
00:16:32,00:16:33,sort of celebrity lakes.
00:16:33,00:16:34,- Yeah.
00:16:34,00:16:36,"- And then there's this line stretching across the country,"
00:16:36,00:16:39,"above which it's just monstrously full of lakes,"
00:16:39,00:16:41,"just lakes everywhere, like Thoreau Brick."
00:16:41,00:16:44,"And it's because there's a region near the coast,"
00:16:44,00:16:47,"further up near the coastal mountains, which is lower,"
00:16:47,00:16:50,'cause the mountains kind of depressed land around them
00:16:50,00:16:52,"with their lamb mass, didn't know mountains did that."
00:16:52,00:16:53,"And everywhere else in the world,"
00:16:53,00:16:54,"or most other places, these depressions,"
00:16:54,00:16:57,"they turn into river valleys, water flows along, right?"
00:16:57,00:16:59,"But Canada is very far north,"
00:16:59,00:17:02,"so it rains less, so there's less water."
00:17:02,00:17:05,And it's also to do with the ice sheets
00:17:05,00:17:07,that dug these huge holes in the ground.
00:17:07,00:17:11,And that leads to lakes when the ice retreats.
00:17:11,00:17:11,Do you know what I mean?
00:17:11,00:17:14,You've got basically lake-shaped masses everywhere.
00:17:14,00:17:18,"- Yeah, it was the Laurentide ice sheet, wasn't it?"
00:17:18,00:17:21,And that also formed Niagara Falls and the Great Lakes.
00:17:21,00:17:22,So it was a biggie.
00:17:22,00:17:26,And it might also have given us Noah's Ark.
00:17:26,00:17:29,So apparently the collapse of that ice sheet
00:17:29,00:17:33,"caused the flooding of the Gibraltar,"
00:17:33,00:17:35,"Straits of Gibraltar, loads of water going"
00:17:35,00:17:38,"into the Mediterranean Sea, huge floods everywhere"
00:17:38,00:17:41,"about 8,000 years ago, and maybe all the myths"
00:17:41,00:17:45,that we have about floods in all different cultures
00:17:45,00:17:48,"have flood myths, maybe due to that collapse."
00:17:48,00:17:49,Love it.
00:17:49,00:17:50,- That's amazing.
00:17:50,00:17:51,It's crazy.
00:17:51,00:17:55,"So 900,000 lakes in Canada, you're saying Andy."
00:17:55,00:17:59,"Manitoba is an area that has 100,000 of those lakes."
00:17:59,00:18:03,"And only 10,000 of those lakes have been named."
00:18:03,00:18:06,"As of 2017, the number will have gone up,"
00:18:06,00:18:07,but they're trying to give names
00:18:07,00:18:08,to every single lake that's out there.
00:18:08,00:18:09,- Can we campaign?
00:18:09,00:18:12,"- Well, here's the thing to what have a lake named after us."
00:18:12,00:18:13,Doesn't work like that.
00:18:13,00:18:14,- Fish Lake.
00:18:14,00:18:21,"- Well, this is a problem that there's not a big group"
00:18:21,00:18:22,that names the lakes.
00:18:22,00:18:24,There's one main guy and then he's got a few assistants.
00:18:24,00:18:25,- What?
00:18:25,00:18:26,- Yeah.
00:18:26,00:18:26,"- Well, that's why they haven't gone around"
00:18:26,00:18:27,to name them all yet.
00:18:27,00:18:28,- It's been very slow.
00:18:28,00:18:31,"He'll name like seven a year, but that's gone up now"
00:18:31,00:18:32,with the assistants.
00:18:32,00:18:34,- Maybe as slow as Dylan Thomas writing poetry.
00:18:34,00:18:37,Is this guy just going around doing rock star shows
00:18:37,00:18:38,"and saying, ""I named lakes""?"
00:18:38,00:18:39,- Exactly.
00:18:39,00:18:40,The thing he says is he gets a lot of calls
00:18:40,00:18:42,"on Valentine's Day with people saying,"
00:18:42,00:18:45,"""Can I in a romantic gesture name this lake"
00:18:45,00:18:47,"""after my partner or girlfriend or boyfriend or whatever?"""
00:18:47,00:18:49,"And he says, ""No, it doesn't work like that."""
00:18:49,00:18:52,- Is he stressed that all these lakes don't have names
00:18:52,00:18:53,or is he relaxed about it?
00:18:53,00:18:54,"- He's relaxed, he's taken his time."
00:18:54,00:18:56,What they're doing is basically naming it
00:18:56,00:18:59,after fallen soldiers from World War II and World War I.
00:18:59,00:19:00,And it's important work
00:19:00,00:19:03,"because if you happen to have an accident at a lake,"
00:19:03,00:19:04,how do you find it if there's no name?
00:19:04,00:19:05,"- Dan, if it's important work,"
00:19:05,00:19:07,maybe he should be trying to name more than seven
00:19:07,00:19:08,every year.
00:19:08,00:19:10,"- He has, there was one year where they named 2,000."
00:19:10,00:19:13,"Like it's with it because he got assistants in,"
00:19:13,00:19:13,assistants came in.
00:19:13,00:19:15,- Pegas can't be choosers.
00:19:15,00:19:18,"I think if I say, ""Can you name your lake Polina?"""
00:19:18,00:19:20,"He shouldn't be saying, ""No, I have to do it"
00:19:20,00:19:22,"""after this other thing instead."""
00:19:22,00:19:23,- I think he should be accepting these names
00:19:23,00:19:25,"because he needs 20,000 of them."
00:19:25,00:19:26,"- He needs a lot of, he needs a lot."
00:19:26,00:19:29,"And in fact, there's only been one exception so far."
00:19:29,00:19:32,"One living person, when an Olympic gold medalist"
00:19:32,00:19:34,"in hockey was given a lake name,"
00:19:34,00:19:37,he sort of got put ahead of all the fallen soldiers.
00:19:37,00:19:38,"- They'll do anything for hockey players,"
00:19:38,00:19:40,"the Canadians, right Ney?"
00:19:40,00:19:41,I think he needs to be sacked.
00:19:41,00:19:42,Sorry.
00:19:42,00:19:46,- Do you know what the most common lake name
00:19:46,00:19:48,in the United States of America is?
00:19:48,00:19:51,"- Oh, is it, is it guessable?"
00:19:51,00:19:52,- Maybe.
00:19:52,00:19:55,- Is it Big Lake or Deep Lake?
00:19:55,00:19:56,"- No, but you're getting there."
00:19:56,00:19:57,It's very descriptive.
00:19:57,00:19:59,- Round Lake.
00:19:59,00:20:00,- Round Lake.
00:20:00,00:20:01,- Wet Lake.
00:20:01,00:20:03,- That's the closest.
00:20:03,00:20:05,It's Mud Lake.
00:20:05,00:20:06,- Really?
00:20:06,00:20:09,"- Yeah, there are 900 Mud Lakes in America,"
00:20:09,00:20:11,"but they're endangered really,"
00:20:11,00:20:13,'cause they're all getting renamed.
00:20:13,00:20:17,"So Michigan, for instance, had 300 Mud Lakes,"
00:20:17,00:20:20,but 71 of them have been changed in the last few years.
00:20:20,00:20:21,- Why are they changing them?
00:20:21,00:20:22,Is it not politically correct?
00:20:22,00:20:24,"- Well, one reason that you want to,"
00:20:24,00:20:26,"like Mud Lake isn't very nice,"
00:20:26,00:20:28,"but number two, like Dan said,"
00:20:28,00:20:30,you need to be able to tell exactly where something is.
00:20:30,00:20:33,"So if you've got 700 Mud Lakes,"
00:20:33,00:20:35,"and you say I've injured myself next to Mud Lake,"
00:20:35,00:20:37,what are they going to do?
00:20:37,00:20:38,"- Yeah, you're right."
00:20:38,00:20:39,"There are reports, and again,"
00:20:39,00:20:41,this is at the level of Dylan Thomas
00:20:41,00:20:43,was buried in a banana shape.
00:20:43,00:20:44,- Oh God.
00:20:44,00:20:45,- It's great.
00:20:45,00:20:48,"Well, there's a lake in Canada called Lake Minnewenka,"
00:20:48,00:20:49,but that is true.
00:20:49,00:20:52,"Some reports say it's the smallest lake in Canada,"
00:20:52,00:20:53,and it appears not to be.
00:20:53,00:20:55,"I think there are some smaller,"
00:20:55,00:20:56,"but it is home to a drowned village,"
00:20:56,00:20:58,which is called Minnewenka Landing.
00:20:58,00:20:59,- Cool.
00:20:59,00:21:00,(laughing)
00:21:00,00:21:02,'Cause that was named after someone who drove a mini.
00:21:02,00:21:06,- It was when Tom Cruise lands his plane.
00:21:06,00:21:08,That's why he radiates into the control tower as a joke.
00:21:08,00:21:09,(laughing)
00:21:09,00:21:13,"- All this depends on how you define a lake, right?"
00:21:13,00:21:13,- Yeah.
00:21:13,00:21:16,"- Because there's a thing called Lagos, L-A-G-O-S,"
00:21:16,00:21:18,which is like a research.
00:21:18,00:21:20,"It's like the Wikipedia of lakes,"
00:21:20,00:21:21,where you go to if you wanna know anything
00:21:21,00:21:23,"about lakes in North America,"
00:21:23,00:21:26,but they define a lake as something that is one hectare
00:21:26,00:21:28,"in area, surface area."
00:21:28,00:21:30,So that's about two football fields.
00:21:30,00:21:33,"But if you were to count lakes that are like one hectare,"
00:21:33,00:21:34,"so half that size,"
00:21:34,00:21:36,then the number of lakes in Canada
00:21:36,00:21:37,goes up to 3.5 million.
00:21:37,00:21:38,- Oh my goodness.
00:21:38,00:21:39,- That's getting stupid.
00:21:39,00:21:41,I was supposed to get a puddle.
00:21:41,00:21:43,"- That guy at the naming office is gonna be,"
00:21:43,00:21:45,probably still relaxed.
00:21:45,00:21:46,We've got time.
00:21:46,00:21:48,- And the other scientific definition of a lake
00:21:48,00:21:50,is it needs to have an aphotic zone.
00:21:50,00:21:53,So that's an area deep enough where
00:21:53,00:21:55,"plants can't grow, 'cause they don't get enough light."
00:21:55,00:21:56,- Oh really?
00:21:56,00:21:57,- Okay.
00:21:57,00:21:59,- That's supposed to be the level between a pond and a lake.
00:21:59,00:22:01,"- There's, interestingly, on the definition of a lake,"
00:22:01,00:22:04,there's also the bigness of lakes.
00:22:04,00:22:07,"So Lake Superior, one of the great lakes,"
00:22:07,00:22:08,and the great lakes are all shared
00:22:08,00:22:11,"between the US and Canada, except one, Lake Michigan."
00:22:11,00:22:13,"Lake Superior is the largest lake on earth,"
00:22:13,00:22:17,"but only if you don't count the Caspian Sea,"
00:22:17,00:22:19,which is about five times bigger.
00:22:19,00:22:21,"And it's really interesting, the Caspian Sea controversy,"
00:22:21,00:22:26,"because Caspian Sea is technically a lake, I believe,"
00:22:26,00:22:29,"as in it's not connected to the sea,"
00:22:29,00:22:32,but it has higher salinity than almost any other lake.
00:22:32,00:22:33,So it's a huge political debate
00:22:33,00:22:36,"between Azerbaijan, Iran, Kazakhstan, Russia,"
00:22:36,00:22:40,"Turkmenistan, which all border this lake/sea,"
00:22:40,00:22:42,"'cause if it's a lake, you split it equally."
00:22:42,00:22:46,So that's why all the great lakes are split equally
00:22:46,00:22:47,between the US and Canada.
00:22:47,00:22:48,"And it's usually important,"
00:22:48,00:22:50,'cause it's got massive natural resources.
00:22:50,00:22:51,"It's got loads of loads of oil deposits in it,"
00:22:51,00:22:53,mineral deposits.
00:22:53,00:22:56,"And so Iran, which has a very short coast on the Caspian,"
00:22:56,00:22:58,"is saying, no, it's definitely a lake."
00:22:58,00:22:59,"Definitely a lake,"
00:22:59,00:23:01,'cause I want to split it equally with the rest of you.
00:23:01,00:23:03,"- Whereas if it's the seashore,"
00:23:03,00:23:06,you own a distance away from the seashore.
00:23:06,00:23:08,- Depending on your length of coastline.
00:23:08,00:23:09,Exactly.
00:23:09,00:23:12,"So then, you know, Russia's saying, or Kazakhstan,"
00:23:12,00:23:13,"which has a huge coastline,"
00:23:13,00:23:14,"is saying, this is bullshit."
00:23:14,00:23:16,You can't take a fifth of the oil in it.
00:23:16,00:23:17,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:23:17,00:23:18,- Wow.
00:23:18,00:23:19,- So which side do you fall on?
00:23:19,00:23:21,- And when would we get a resolution to...
00:23:21,00:23:23,"- No, honestly, turn."
00:23:23,00:23:25,I think they got a few other things to iron out
00:23:25,00:23:26,in that region.
00:23:26,00:23:29,"- Yeah, there was a massive meeting in 2018"
00:23:29,00:23:31,called the Convention on the Legal Status
00:23:31,00:23:34,"of the Caspian Sea, where all the countries met,"
00:23:34,00:23:35,"and they were there for weeks,"
00:23:35,00:23:37,and they concluded it's neither a lake nor a sea.
00:23:37,00:23:37,"- Oh, great."
00:23:37,00:23:40,- It's a pond.
00:23:42,00:23:43,Here's a lake.
00:23:43,00:23:45,This is also in the United States of America.
00:23:45,00:23:47,"It's called Crater Lake,"
00:23:47,00:23:49,and the Kalmath people who live around it
00:23:49,00:23:53,"haven't looked at it for more than 7,000 years."
00:23:53,00:23:54,- No.
00:23:54,00:23:56,How close do they live?
00:23:56,00:23:57,- They don't know.
00:23:57,00:24:00,(all laughing)
00:24:00,00:24:00,- Do they fall in?
00:24:00,00:24:02,"- No, they don't fall in."
00:24:02,00:24:05,"So it's basically, it's a taboo."
00:24:05,00:24:06,- Wow.
00:24:06,00:24:09,"- And it's, we think down to an eruption"
00:24:09,00:24:12,"that happened 7,700 years ago,"
00:24:12,00:24:14,and then they preserved these stories
00:24:14,00:24:16,"of this myth that's happened,"
00:24:16,00:24:20,and that would be 300 generations of word of mouth
00:24:20,00:24:21,have kept this story going.
00:24:21,00:24:22,- Don't look at the lake.
00:24:22,00:24:24,"- And they still don't look at the lake, yeah."
00:24:24,00:24:25,- What if you accidentally look at the lake?
00:24:25,00:24:27,"- Another eruption, probably."
00:24:27,00:24:29,- Someone must have.
00:24:29,00:24:30,- No one's done it.
00:24:30,00:24:31,We don't know.
00:24:31,00:24:33,(all laughing)
00:24:33,00:24:34,"- Well, we'd know."
00:24:34,00:24:34,We would know.
00:24:34,00:24:35,"- We would know, yeah?"
00:24:35,00:24:36,- Wow.
00:24:36,00:24:37,- That's crazy.
00:24:37,00:24:40,- Some lakes swing from side to side.
00:24:40,00:24:42,- Really? - Like a banana.
00:24:42,00:24:44,"- Well, they're called banana lakes."
00:24:44,00:24:45,"No, they're not."
00:24:45,00:24:46,- Okay.
00:24:46,00:24:47,- This is amazing though.
00:24:47,00:24:48,"They're these things called sashes,"
00:24:48,00:24:50,"and the most famous one is in Lake Erie,"
00:24:50,00:24:52,which is one of the great lakes.
00:24:52,00:24:54,"But basically, it happens if there's a really strong wind"
00:24:54,00:24:56,"that's going in one direction on a lake,"
00:24:56,00:24:58,"and it keeps pushing the water up to one end,"
00:24:58,00:25:00,"and then the wind suddenly stops,"
00:25:00,00:25:03,"then the water, you can imagine like in a bath,"
00:25:03,00:25:06,"swings backwards, and it does extraordinary things."
00:25:06,00:25:11,"Like in 2008, there were 16 feet high waves in Lake Erie"
00:25:11,00:25:14,"that flooded, it's Buffalo, I think,"
00:25:14,00:25:15,in New York that always gets flooded.
00:25:15,00:25:20,"In 1844, there was a 22 foot high Seish wave,"
00:25:20,00:25:22,"which caused this flood in Buffalo,"
00:25:22,00:25:24,"which destroyed the town completely,"
00:25:24,00:25:25,just from this swinging lake.
00:25:25,00:25:26,- Crazy.
00:25:26,00:25:30,"- 78 people died, it stopped the Niagara Falls from flowing,"
00:25:30,00:25:32,"'cause it dammed it up, 'cause like the force of all the water"
00:25:32,00:25:34,"pushed the ice to the top of Niagara Falls,"
00:25:34,00:25:36,and stopped it flowing.
00:25:36,00:25:36,- What?
00:25:36,00:25:38,"- Just from this swinging lake, isn't that cool?"
00:25:38,00:25:39,- That's very cool.
00:25:39,00:25:41,"Not the deaths, but yeah, the other stuff."
00:25:41,00:25:42,"- Yeah, it was a long time ago."
00:25:42,00:25:43,- Okay.
00:25:43,00:25:44,- Yeah.
00:25:44,00:25:47,- Canada is so big that the southernmost point of Canada
00:25:47,00:25:49,is closer to Brazil than it is
00:25:49,00:25:51,to the northernmost point of Canada.
00:25:51,00:25:52,- I don't believe you.
00:25:52,00:25:54,"- Well, you've got to."
00:25:54,00:25:55,- Okay.
00:25:55,00:25:56,- Maths.
00:25:56,00:25:57,- How do we resolve this then?
00:25:57,00:25:58,(all laughing)
00:25:58,00:25:59,- We need a conference.
00:25:59,00:26:01,(all laughing)
00:26:01,00:26:05,"- I mean, yeah, only because I've seen maps."
00:26:05,00:26:09,"- I mean, that's, it's about, there's not much in it,"
00:26:09,00:26:10,"it's about 10 kilometers in it, but it's a lot."
00:26:10,00:26:11,- 10 kilometers in it?
00:26:11,00:26:12,- Yeah.
00:26:12,00:26:13,- That's so close.
00:26:13,00:26:14,- Southernmost point of Canada to northernmost point
00:26:14,00:26:18,"of Canada is 4,620 kilometers."
00:26:18,00:26:19,- Right.
00:26:19,00:26:22,"- To Brazil, from the southernmost point of Canada,"
00:26:22,00:26:24,"it's 4,630."
00:26:24,00:26:25,- Yeah.
00:26:25,00:26:29,- That's like how my house in Margate is closer to Belgium
00:26:29,00:26:31,than it is to London.
00:26:31,00:26:31,- Yeah.
00:26:31,00:26:32,- That's wild.
00:26:32,00:26:33,- And it takes you hours and hours and hours
00:26:33,00:26:34,to get here every day.
00:26:34,00:26:36,(all laughing)
00:26:36,00:26:38,- I should stop going via Belgium.
00:26:38,00:26:40,(all laughing)
00:26:40,00:26:42,(upbeat music)
00:26:42,00:26:47,"- Okay, it is time for fact number three,"
00:26:47,00:26:48,and that is James.
00:26:48,00:26:50,"- Okay, my fact this week is that"
00:26:50,00:26:52,"at one Spanish football stadium,"
00:26:52,00:26:54,"they will stop you from eating sunflower seeds,"
00:26:54,00:26:57,but they won't stop you from smoking.
00:26:57,00:26:58,- That is so weird.
00:26:58,00:27:00,Is it?
00:27:00,00:27:03,"Are you allowed to smoke sunflower seeds, life hack?"
00:27:03,00:27:04,"- Oh, good thinking."
00:27:04,00:27:05,- Yeah.
00:27:05,00:27:06,"- Yeah, roll up."
00:27:06,00:27:07,(all laughing)
00:27:07,00:27:10,"- Actually, you're not really supposed to smoke,"
00:27:10,00:27:12,but they don't enforce that ban.
00:27:12,00:27:13,"- Oh, okay."
00:27:13,00:27:15,"- But they are enforcing that ban on sunflower seeds,"
00:27:15,00:27:19,"and that's because if you go to Spanish football games,"
00:27:19,00:27:23,you will often bring sunflower seeds with you as a snack.
00:27:23,00:27:25,"They're called pipas,"
00:27:25,00:27:28,and this team called Elche has decided to ban them
00:27:28,00:27:30,"because people keep,"
00:27:30,00:27:32,"you kind of, you crack them open and eat the seeds inside,"
00:27:32,00:27:34,"and then you throw the shells away,"
00:27:34,00:27:36,"and the shells, they clog the drains,"
00:27:36,00:27:38,"they clog the pipes,"
00:27:38,00:27:41,"they rot and deteriorate the seeds,"
00:27:41,00:27:44,"the pigeons come, rats come,"
00:27:44,00:27:47,"and they're having to basically redo the entire stadium,"
00:27:47,00:27:51,and part of the reason is because these sunflower seeds
00:27:51,00:27:52,"are just all over the place and they're rotting,"
00:27:52,00:27:54,and they're making everything ming in.
00:27:54,00:27:55,"- Yeah, there's too many for them to clean up,"
00:27:55,00:27:57,"so as you arrive,"
00:27:57,00:27:59,"you just crack in shells underneath your foot,"
00:27:59,00:28:00,go into your seats.
00:28:00,00:28:02,"It's pretty amazing,"
00:28:02,00:28:04,such a tiny thing causing such chaos.
00:28:04,00:28:05,"- And this was in the times that I read this,"
00:28:05,00:28:07,and one of the fans said this is the best thing
00:28:07,00:28:08,"they could have done,"
00:28:08,00:28:11,and now they just have to enforce the ban on smoking.
00:28:11,00:28:11,(laughing)
00:28:11,00:28:12,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:28:12,00:28:15,Is it Spain-wide that these things are enjoyed?
00:28:15,00:28:17,"- It's common throughout Spain, yeah."
00:28:17,00:28:18,"- Really interesting,"
00:28:18,00:28:20,"'cause it's quite a hippie-ish, quite healthy thing,"
00:28:20,00:28:22,"I imagine, like, oh, I'm just eating some sunflower seeds."
00:28:22,00:28:24,- This is a really salty.
00:28:24,00:28:26,"- Oh, okay, they're very snacky."
00:28:26,00:28:27,"- This is the thing that I discovered,"
00:28:27,00:28:30,it's this whole global culture that we do not have
00:28:30,00:28:33,"in Britain of sunflower seeds being such a popular snack,"
00:28:33,00:28:34,"and they're all these countries,"
00:28:34,00:28:35,"so Spain is one of them,"
00:28:35,00:28:36,"where they're really popular,"
00:28:36,00:28:37,"across Eastern Europe,"
00:28:37,00:28:39,"Eastern European listeners,"
00:28:39,00:28:41,"writing, ""Confirm how many sunflower seeds you eat a day."""
00:28:41,00:28:43,"China, the Middle East, Russia,"
00:28:43,00:28:45,"they're like this big deal snack,"
00:28:45,00:28:48,"and so I think in China, you have them in the shells,"
00:28:48,00:28:50,"and it's this great meditative experience,"
00:28:50,00:28:53,"the one girl was saying that you put it in your mouth,"
00:28:53,00:28:55,you have to get the sunflower seed out of the shell.
00:28:55,00:28:58,"- Yeah, you kind of do it with your teeth on it, yeah."
00:28:58,00:28:59,- So the little gray thing that I get
00:28:59,00:29:00,when I buy a packet of sunflower seeds
00:29:00,00:29:02,"is not a sunflower seed,"
00:29:02,00:29:04,"it's actually, that's the kernel."
00:29:04,00:29:05,"- Yeah, it's a kernel."
00:29:05,00:29:06,"- A de-hulled kernel,"
00:29:06,00:29:08,"whereas people here are eating the naked seeds,"
00:29:08,00:29:10,"which are the black and white striped, they're bigger."
00:29:10,00:29:11,"- Better inside, yeah."
00:29:11,00:29:13,- That is a sunflower seed.
00:29:13,00:29:14,"- Yeah, and it's pretty amazing."
00:29:14,00:29:17,I went to the National Gallery the other day
00:29:17,00:29:21,"to look specifically at Van Gogh's sunflowers, right?"
00:29:21,00:29:22,- I was research with this fact.
00:29:22,00:29:24,"- No, it's completely separate."
00:29:24,00:29:26,"I was just, I thought, ""God, it's around the corner,"
00:29:26,00:29:27,"why have I not been there?"""
00:29:27,00:29:29,"And I went, stood, and just stared,"
00:29:29,00:29:31,"and each flower, there's 11 flowers,"
00:29:31,00:29:34,"they contain about 2000, between one and 2000 seeds."
00:29:34,00:29:37,"That would have been edible, you know, what was in the pot."
00:29:37,00:29:38,I find that fascinating.
00:29:38,00:29:40,I've never thought about it in that way before.
00:29:40,00:29:41,"- No, me neither."
00:29:41,00:29:42,If you're really hungry
00:29:42,00:29:43,"and you've got a sunflower growing in your kitchen,"
00:29:43,00:29:46,"scrape off the top, if it's reached ripeness,"
00:29:46,00:29:47,and get some seeds out.
00:29:47,00:29:49,- There's like a TikTok trend at the moment
00:29:49,00:29:53,where people are like roasting entire sunflower heads
00:29:53,00:29:54,and eating them.
00:29:54,00:29:56,- Ooh. - They're really.
00:29:56,00:29:58,"- I mean, it's just classic TikTok."
00:29:58,00:29:58,- That doesn't seem so.
00:29:58,00:29:59,- Everyone's a food expert
00:29:59,00:30:01,"until you actually try what you're eating,"
00:30:01,00:30:02,and then it's disgusting.
00:30:02,00:30:04,"- Well, people do seem to rave about them."
00:30:04,00:30:05,"And I was reading in China,"
00:30:05,00:30:07,the way they harvest them is really cool.
00:30:07,00:30:09,So people go through with digmachetes
00:30:09,00:30:10,"or massive pairs of scissors,"
00:30:10,00:30:12,and they chop the heads off all the...
00:30:12,00:30:14,"Yeah, or nail scissors, whatever you've got to have."
00:30:14,00:30:16,- Like you're opening a department store.
00:30:16,00:30:18,"- Yeah, exactly, a lot of ribbons to cut."
00:30:18,00:30:21,"They chop the heads off each individual sunflower,"
00:30:21,00:30:23,"but then they pick up the heads,"
00:30:23,00:30:24,"they spin them upside down,"
00:30:24,00:30:26,"and they plonk them back on top of the stalk,"
00:30:26,00:30:29,and they leave them there for another week to dry.
00:30:29,00:30:31,And that's 'cause it saves having to dry them
00:30:31,00:30:32,in a certain space.
00:30:32,00:30:36,So you'll sometimes go to a big sunflower field in China
00:30:36,00:30:38,"and be like, ""Oh, the flowers are upside down."""
00:30:38,00:30:40,- Yeah. - They've all been decapitated.
00:30:40,00:30:41,- They've all been decapitated
00:30:41,00:30:42,and had their heads put on upside down.
00:30:42,00:30:44,- Who did this?
00:30:44,00:30:45,- That's amazing. - What a psycho.
00:30:45,00:30:48,"- So I should just say L.J., by the way,"
00:30:48,00:30:50,"the football team, they're from Alicante."
00:30:50,00:30:53,They were promoted to La Liga last season.
00:30:53,00:30:55,And I read as much as I could about them.
00:30:55,00:30:57,"There's not a great deal of interesting stuff,"
00:30:57,00:31:01,"apart from the Ketman, the head Ketman is called Pepito,"
00:31:01,00:31:04,whose name is Spanish for pumpkin seed.
00:31:04,00:31:06,"- Lovely, lovely."
00:31:06,00:31:07,"- It's not quite right, is it?"
00:31:07,00:31:08,- No. - You haven't quite
00:31:08,00:31:10,got that almost all the time. - Almost got it.
00:31:10,00:31:12,"I saw his name and I was like,"
00:31:12,00:31:14,"""That really looks like it means sunflower seed."""
00:31:14,00:31:16,"- Yeah. - But unfortunately,"
00:31:16,00:31:18,"no, 'pipas' is the sunflower seed,"
00:31:18,00:31:20,which also means blowjobs in Greek.
00:31:20,00:31:21,"- Golly. - Oh, cool."
00:31:21,00:31:23,"- Well, that wasn't,"
00:31:23,00:31:25,surely that one would have led to any confusion.
00:31:25,00:31:30,A load of Spanish football fans turn up at Panofinaikos.
00:31:30,00:31:32,- You've got to crack it open with your teeth.
00:31:32,00:31:34,(laughing)
00:31:34,00:31:39,- They are known these seeds as Spain's football foreplay.
00:31:39,00:31:42,I don't know if you can cross that phrase here.
00:31:42,00:31:43,But what is Britain's football foreplay?
00:31:43,00:31:45,- Pies. - You guys go to football with pies.
00:31:45,00:31:46,- Pies of pies. - Nice pie.
00:31:46,00:31:48,"- As in, that's just foreplay in general, isn't it?"
00:31:48,00:31:50,A nice steak and kidney pie.
00:31:50,00:31:52,"- Scotch pies, they're called."
00:31:52,00:31:53,- What is a Scotch pie?
00:31:53,00:31:55,"- Scotch pie is,"
00:31:55,00:31:57,"probably if you go to football in the South of England,"
00:31:57,00:31:58,"you don't really get this stuff,"
00:31:58,00:32:00,"but certainly in the North of England,"
00:32:00,00:32:03,"they're kind of made of pastry, like water pastry,"
00:32:03,00:32:06,"and they usually have mutton in them, lots of potato,"
00:32:06,00:32:09,"not so much meat, absolutely delicious."
00:32:09,00:32:10,- Yeah. - Yum.
00:32:10,00:32:14,"- And they were supposedly despised by the Scottish Church,"
00:32:14,00:32:17,because they were considered a sumptuous meal
00:32:17,00:32:20,and very similar to English pies.
00:32:20,00:32:23,"So the Scottish Church tried to ban Scotch pies for a while,"
00:32:23,00:32:24,but they never managed.
00:32:24,00:32:26,"- I would say keep your beaks out, guys."
00:32:26,00:32:29,I just think that's not the jurisdiction to...
00:32:29,00:32:31,- Like the Church tends to get involved
00:32:31,00:32:33,"in lots of different things, doesn't it?"
00:32:33,00:32:35,"Historically, especially the Scottish Church."
00:32:35,00:32:37,- I just think that's a bit like Jimmy Carter
00:32:37,00:32:40,getting involved in Dylan Thomas' posthumous reputation.
00:32:40,00:32:42,"I just think, come on, prioritise."
00:32:42,00:32:44,- Not your area. - You've got perks to run.
00:32:44,00:32:47,"- Actually, it was because of the Church,"
00:32:47,00:32:50,I think that sunflower seeds came to be.
00:32:50,00:32:53,"- Well, unless you're saying that God made them."
00:32:53,00:32:55,- Exactly.
00:32:55,00:32:58,"Sorry, yeah, that we started eating sunflower seeds,"
00:32:58,00:33:01,"because, so they were huge in Russia first."
00:33:01,00:33:03,"Russia was like 100 years ahead of the rest of us,"
00:33:03,00:33:05,"mainly in terms of turning them into oil,"
00:33:05,00:33:07,which is where it's so valuable.
00:33:07,00:33:10,"And it was basically because during any kind of fast,"
00:33:10,00:33:13,"Christian fasting or Lent or anything like that in Russia,"
00:33:13,00:33:15,"then any kind of vegetable oils were banned,"
00:33:15,00:33:18,and then Peter the Great or his minions have discovered
00:33:18,00:33:20,that you could get oil from sunflower seeds.
00:33:20,00:33:21,"- It was Peter the Great when he, you know,"
00:33:21,00:33:25,"he did his European tour, he saw them in like the Netherlands"
00:33:25,00:33:26,or something and brought them back.
00:33:26,00:33:28,"- He did, yes."
00:33:28,00:33:31,"And then some peasant in Russia in the 19th century,"
00:33:31,00:33:33,"just working in the fields peasant,"
00:33:33,00:33:35,built a machine to get oil out of them.
00:33:35,00:33:37,"And because they were new oil,"
00:33:37,00:33:40,the Church hadn't managed to create in its list
00:33:40,00:33:42,the name sunflower oil. - It's so funny.
00:33:42,00:33:44,- And so everyone just drenched their food
00:33:44,00:33:45,with sunflower oil during Lent.
00:33:45,00:33:46,That's why it was so popular.
00:33:46,00:33:50,- And now Ukraine and Russia is by far the biggest producers
00:33:50,00:33:52,"of sunflower oil in the world, like by a billion."
00:33:52,00:33:55,"- I read that, it's like, more than half the global production"
00:33:55,00:33:56,is there. - Yeah.
00:33:56,00:33:58,And that's why Ukraine like the sunflower
00:33:58,00:33:59,is a symbol of Ukraine.
00:33:59,00:34:01,"- I see, I didn't know that."
00:34:01,00:34:03,- It was used as well for mopping up basically
00:34:03,00:34:06,a lot of the radioactive waste during the Chernobyl disaster.
00:34:06,00:34:07,- Was it?
00:34:07,00:34:08,"- Yeah, so the stems,"
00:34:08,00:34:10,"they noticed that when they put them into bodies of water,"
00:34:10,00:34:13,that it would take up a lot of the radioactive elements
00:34:13,00:34:14,and then they could bring it away
00:34:14,00:34:16,and then they could discard it in a better way.
00:34:16,00:34:19,"But so, sunflowers are planted largely"
00:34:19,00:34:22,around nuclear radioactive areas in Chernobyl and use.
00:34:22,00:34:23,"- Gosh, sunflowers are useful."
00:34:23,00:34:24,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:34:24,00:34:27,- Famous pop culture person who eats sunflower seeds.
00:34:27,00:34:29,- Okay.
00:34:29,00:34:30,- Cardi B.
00:34:30,00:34:33,- Cardi B.
00:34:33,00:34:34,- Good shout.
00:34:34,00:34:35,"- Someone that you guys have,"
00:34:35,00:34:37,a character that you guys will be familiar with.
00:34:37,00:34:38,- Can you give us a clue?
00:34:38,00:34:40,"- Olex Snoopy, a fictional character."
00:34:40,00:34:42,"- Yeah, 1990s."
00:34:42,00:34:43,- 1990s fictional character.
00:34:43,00:34:45,- The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air.
00:34:45,00:34:46,"- Very good, no."
00:34:46,00:34:47,- Dennis the Manus.
00:34:47,00:34:48,- No.
00:34:48,00:34:49,"- Oh yeah, cartoon or real?"
00:34:49,00:34:50,- Real.
00:34:50,00:34:52,"- Zach from ""Saved by the Bell""."
00:34:52,00:34:55,"- Okay, Blobby, Blobby, Blobby."
00:34:55,00:34:56,- British or American?
00:34:56,00:34:57,- American.
00:34:57,00:34:58,- Okay.
00:34:58,00:35:00,- One of the Simpsons.
00:35:00,00:35:02,"- No, but one of the biggest shows of the 1990s."
00:35:02,00:35:03,- Friends.
00:35:03,00:35:05,"- People are yelling this at home, not friends."
00:35:05,00:35:08,Something that Dan would like due to his other podcast.
00:35:08,00:35:11,- A weird equippity thing.
00:35:11,00:35:14,"- Come on guys, the truth is out there."
00:35:14,00:35:17,"- Oh, the ex-Fox Mulder loved Sunflower Seeds."
00:35:17,00:35:21,"- Fox Mulder, he eats Sunflower Seeds all the way through it."
00:35:21,00:35:23,And he had to stop in the later series
00:35:23,00:35:24,"because according to him,"
00:35:24,00:35:26,it's hard to act with Sunflower Seeds.
00:35:26,00:35:30,"But it was the creator, Chris Carter,"
00:35:30,00:35:32,who would eat Sunflower Seeds.
00:35:32,00:35:34,And he kind of passed it on to the character.
00:35:34,00:35:36,"But David D'Covny, who played Mulder,"
00:35:36,00:35:38,wants people to know that he doesn't like
00:35:38,00:35:41,Sunflower Seeds and he also does not wear ties.
00:35:41,00:35:44,So fans are discouraged from sending him either.
00:35:44,00:35:48,"- Poor guy, so he's forced to eat the Sunflower Seeds"
00:35:48,00:35:49,constantly.
00:35:49,00:35:51,- And wear lots of ties as well.
00:35:51,00:35:53,Poor guy.
00:35:53,00:35:54,- I mentioned Van Gogh earlier.
00:35:54,00:35:56,There's another very famous art piece
00:35:56,00:35:57,which is called Sunflower Seeds.
00:35:57,00:35:59,Do you remember that?
00:35:59,00:35:59,- Ai Wei Wei.
00:35:59,00:36:01,"- Ai Wei Wei, 2011."
00:36:01,00:36:04,So this is extraordinary.
00:36:04,00:36:06,He handcrafted Porcelain Sunflower Seeds
00:36:06,00:36:09,"with his team, there was 1,600 people,"
00:36:09,00:36:13,and they made 100 million of them.
00:36:13,00:36:14,- It feels like he's the guy to solve
00:36:14,00:36:17,the Canadian Lake naming dilemma.
00:36:17,00:36:19,Like they can just bang through that.
00:36:19,00:36:22,"- If these 1,600 people, I'm sure, you know,"
00:36:22,00:36:25,it's making a very important political point
00:36:25,00:36:26,and stuff like that.
00:36:26,00:36:30,But it's a long time to be making tiny ceramic seeds.
00:36:30,00:36:32,"- Oh, I see, I think it's a bit of a waste of time."
00:36:32,00:36:34,"- I mean, being a podcaster is a waste of time."
00:36:34,00:36:38,"I'm fully accept that, but I just think..."
00:36:38,00:36:42,- We've made 100 million identical episodes of this show.
00:36:42,00:36:44,"But it has been useful, I would say."
00:36:44,00:36:44,"Yes, what's the point?"
00:36:44,00:36:46,"- They weren't identical, were they?"
00:36:46,00:36:47,"They were slightly, I remember this."
00:36:47,00:36:48,"- Oh, 'cause they handcrafted."
00:36:48,00:36:50,"- I was talking about the episodes of the show,"
00:36:50,00:36:53,which is why I remember the slight differences.
00:36:53,00:36:56,"- Well, they put, and so they were first displayed"
00:36:56,00:36:58,at the Turbine Hall at the Tate.
00:36:58,00:37:00,"And if you've ever been there, you know what that's like."
00:37:00,00:37:03,"- Yeah, you get these huge exhibits"
00:37:03,00:37:04,that are really famous every year.
00:37:04,00:37:05,"I went to that one, actually."
00:37:05,00:37:05,- Did you?
00:37:05,00:37:07,Did you get to walk on the seeds?
00:37:07,00:37:07,"- No, I didn't."
00:37:07,00:37:09,- 'Cause I got to walk around on them.
00:37:09,00:37:12,"- So to begin with, and it raised up about 10 centimetres"
00:37:12,00:37:14,"off the ground, that's how many seeds are where the height"
00:37:14,00:37:15,that it reached to.
00:37:15,00:37:16,- Only 10 centimetres?
00:37:16,00:37:17,"- Well, it's a big, it's huge hole."
00:37:17,00:37:18,"- Yeah, it's a massive hole."
00:37:18,00:37:19,- Not very much.
00:37:19,00:37:20,"- Put it in a smaller room, have 'em up to your neck."
00:37:20,00:37:21,That's what I would have done.
00:37:21,00:37:22,- Good idea.
00:37:22,00:37:24,"- Like, that's exciting."
00:37:24,00:37:25,"- No, that's hard."
00:37:25,00:37:28,So was the point he's making is that we're all different?
00:37:28,00:37:30,"- No, the point he was making, I believe."
00:37:30,00:37:32,"Well, there's lots of different points like much art,"
00:37:32,00:37:33,but I think a lot of it.
00:37:33,00:37:35,And this is why the trampling was so important.
00:37:35,00:37:37,And I remember being so disappointed
00:37:37,00:37:39,is about the oppression and repression of the Chinese state
00:37:39,00:37:41,"and all these people, these, you know,"
00:37:41,00:37:43,billions of people in China being treated
00:37:43,00:37:46,just like one random identical sunflower to another.
00:37:46,00:37:47,Don't have your own.
00:37:47,00:37:49,- And I think Chairman Mao used to say
00:37:49,00:37:52,that the people of China were sunflower seeds.
00:37:52,00:37:54,"And his idea is like, if you get all"
00:37:54,00:37:57,"of these hundred million seeds together,"
00:37:57,00:37:59,then they make something very big and important.
00:37:59,00:38:02,"But by themselves, they're kind of..."
00:38:02,00:38:04,"- Oh yeah, that's a different interpretation."
00:38:04,00:38:05,There you go.
00:38:05,00:38:06,- I don't know.
00:38:06,00:38:08,"Like you, I went and was slightly disappointed"
00:38:08,00:38:10,that I wasn't allowed to walk on them.
00:38:10,00:38:11,"- And you weren't allowed, to begin with,"
00:38:11,00:38:13,you were allowed to walk on them and then health and safety
00:38:13,00:38:15,because they thought little micro dust
00:38:15,00:38:16,was coming through from all the crunching.
00:38:16,00:38:19,But it worked out that the equivalent sunflower seeds
00:38:19,00:38:25,"that he made, that Van Gogh would have to paint,"
00:38:25,00:38:27,"would be 50,000 flowers."
00:38:27,00:38:28,- Okay.
00:38:28,00:38:29,"- Because it's about 2,000 seeds per herd, right?"
00:38:29,00:38:30,"- About 2,000."
00:38:30,00:38:31,"I think that math, right?"
00:38:31,00:38:34,"I was 18 whiskies deep by the time I did that, but yeah."
00:38:34,00:38:35,- That's doable.
00:38:35,00:38:38,"- Baseball players also love sunflower seeds, apparently,"
00:38:38,00:38:39,in the USA.
00:38:39,00:38:41,There is this question of why baseball players
00:38:41,00:38:43,are constantly chewing.
00:38:43,00:38:44,'Cause they are.
00:38:44,00:38:46,"If you look at them in the dugout, they're always eating."
00:38:46,00:38:49,So there's one big theory is that the game is boring.
00:38:49,00:38:52,"- My daughter, when she gets bored,"
00:38:52,00:38:54,"she always asks, can I have a snack?"
00:38:54,00:38:56,"- Right, the theory is that's what they're doing."
00:38:56,00:38:57,"You know, they're sporting guys."
00:38:57,00:38:59,"They will burn it off, but basically,"
00:38:59,00:39:01,it's a dull game to watch and to participate in.
00:39:01,00:39:03,"- I really like lots of sports,"
00:39:03,00:39:06,but I do find it difficult to sit in a stadium
00:39:06,00:39:07,through an entire baseball game.
00:39:07,00:39:09,"- Right, there we go."
00:39:09,00:39:10,"- I think there really is a divide in the world,"
00:39:10,00:39:11,"which no other sport has,"
00:39:11,00:39:14,between people who understand why baseball's appealing
00:39:14,00:39:16,"and are obsessed with it, and friends obsessed,"
00:39:16,00:39:18,"and the rest of us who think,"
00:39:18,00:39:21,"""Well, but it sounds like all the players are on our side."""
00:39:21,00:39:22,"- Well, they..."
00:39:22,00:39:26,They know from the inside.
00:39:26,00:39:27,But they used to chew tobacco.
00:39:27,00:39:30,"That's another theory why people,"
00:39:30,00:39:31,"they might choose sunflower seeds now,"
00:39:31,00:39:32,'cause you don't chew tobacco anymore.
00:39:32,00:39:35,- But chewing tobacco could give them some buzz.
00:39:35,00:39:37,- And they had another big advantage.
00:39:37,00:39:39,"When baseball players chew tobacco,"
00:39:39,00:39:41,they could slobber their juice onto the ball.
00:39:41,00:39:42,(laughing)
00:39:42,00:39:43,- Interesting.
00:39:43,00:39:45,- And Phil and Thomas used to slather his juice
00:39:45,00:39:46,onto the surface of the...
00:39:46,00:39:48,(laughing)
00:39:48,00:39:51,"- If you slobbered on the ball, it would become darker,"
00:39:51,00:39:54,and that would be harder for the batter to see.
00:39:54,00:39:57,"So it's a tricky, sneaky way"
00:39:57,00:39:58,of making a camouflage ball.
00:39:58,00:40:01,- I understand this against the rules to do that.
00:40:01,00:40:05,- The rule was changed in 1920 to disallow ball defacing.
00:40:05,00:40:06,That was what it was defined as.
00:40:06,00:40:08,So maybe that's another reason
00:40:08,00:40:09,"for the rise of the sunflower seed,"
00:40:09,00:40:12,apart from the unbearable tedium of watching this game.
00:40:12,00:40:13,(laughing)
00:40:13,00:40:16,"- Okay, speaking of tedious American sports,"
00:40:16,00:40:19,"I mean, I absolutely love American football,"
00:40:19,00:40:23,but what snacks do you associate with American football?
00:40:23,00:40:24,"- Weeners, get your weeners."
00:40:24,00:40:26,"- Hot dogs, oh, that's the same as a weener, isn't it?"
00:40:26,00:40:27,"- So hot dogs, for me,"
00:40:27,00:40:31,"I would more have hot dogs at a baseball game, probably."
00:40:31,00:40:33,- Candy gloss.
00:40:33,00:40:34,- Nutshells.
00:40:34,00:40:36,"- Yeah, all these are good answers."
00:40:36,00:40:36,- Caviar.
00:40:36,00:40:38,- Caviar is correct.
00:40:38,00:40:40,"From the Caspian Sea, the belugas."
00:40:40,00:40:43,"No, it's, I think for me, it's chicken wings."
00:40:43,00:40:44,- Okay.
00:40:44,00:40:45,"- If you're watching the Super Bowl,"
00:40:45,00:40:48,everyone in America basically eats chicken wings.
00:40:48,00:40:52,And this all came due to an accidental
00:40:52,00:40:56,over-order by a company in Buffalo.
00:40:56,00:40:58,They accidentally ordered a load of chicken wings
00:40:58,00:41:01,and they didn't know what to do with them.
00:41:01,00:41:03,"And so they came up with a new recipe,"
00:41:03,00:41:06,which was Buffalo wings.
00:41:06,00:41:08,So you basically put chili sauce and butter together
00:41:08,00:41:10,and it makes this sauce and they're absolutely delicious.
00:41:10,00:41:14,"And this bar called Anchor Bay, they started making them."
00:41:14,00:41:15,"And then a little bit later,"
00:41:15,00:41:19,the Buffalo Bill's NFL team made it to the Super Bowl
00:41:19,00:41:20,for three years in a row.
00:41:20,00:41:23,And everyone associated the Buffalo Bill's team
00:41:23,00:41:24,with Buffalo wings.
00:41:24,00:41:28,And suddenly chicken wings became like the food
00:41:28,00:41:30,for the Super Bowl.
00:41:30,00:41:31,- So it's all a big mistake.
00:41:31,00:41:33,- It's a whole different thing.
00:41:33,00:41:36,But 1.6 billion chicken wings are eaten
00:41:36,00:41:38,on Super Bowl Sunday every year.
00:41:38,00:41:38,- Jesus.
00:41:38,00:41:41,"I think, 'cause Americans get some shit sometimes"
00:41:41,00:41:42,from the rest of the world
00:41:42,00:41:44,about certain elements of their culture.
00:41:44,00:41:46,But one of the greatest cultural things
00:41:46,00:41:47,"that exists in America,"
00:41:47,00:41:48,"which I didn't really know that it was a thing,"
00:41:48,00:41:50,is tailgating.
00:41:50,00:41:51,- Tailgating.
00:41:51,00:41:52,- Or the tailgate.
00:41:52,00:41:54,- Driving very close to the person in front of you.
00:41:54,00:41:55,"- Well, indeed. - That's the only thing I know."
00:41:55,00:41:57,- That's all we know it as.
00:41:57,00:42:01,"But like basically at any NFL match in the parking lot,"
00:42:01,00:42:04,then you'll have a tailgate party and there's hosts.
00:42:04,00:42:07,And I was asking when my husband's lived in America
00:42:07,00:42:09,"and he was like, yeah, I mean, literally everyone does it."
00:42:09,00:42:11,Every NFL match.
00:42:11,00:42:13,- I've been to a couple of NFL matches in America
00:42:13,00:42:15,and I never got invited to this party.
00:42:15,00:42:17,"- I'm so sorry. - Wow, interesting."
00:42:17,00:42:18,"- So wait, sorry, you go to the car park."
00:42:18,00:42:19,- Yep.
00:42:19,00:42:23,And there are just people who are such big fans of the team
00:42:23,00:42:25,that they cook up a massive feast.
00:42:25,00:42:28,They've made like a hundred burgers and pizzas for everyone
00:42:28,00:42:30,and loads of beers and just everyone has it.
00:42:30,00:42:33,"They have a big party, but kind of anyone's invited."
00:42:33,00:42:34,So you go and it's called tailgating.
00:42:34,00:42:37,"- Well, almost anyone's, don't rub it in, am I not?"
00:42:37,00:42:39,(all laughing)
00:42:39,00:42:41,- I was starving that day.
00:42:41,00:42:43,"- Driving around a completely empty town,"
00:42:43,00:42:44,weren't you James?
00:42:44,00:42:45,- I was over a body.
00:42:45,00:42:46,- All the restaurants were closed.
00:42:46,00:42:49,(all laughing)
00:42:49,00:42:57,"- Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show"
00:42:57,00:42:59,and that is Anna.
00:42:59,00:43:01,- My fact this week is that Singaporeans drink
00:43:01,00:43:05,"more than a bottle of Scotch per person per month,"
00:43:05,00:43:08,which is twice as much as their nearest rivals.
00:43:08,00:43:09,- Wow. - Wow.
00:43:09,00:43:10,- What?
00:43:10,00:43:12,- I say the children of Dylan Thomas.
00:43:12,00:43:14,"- I like the way you say rivals,"
00:43:14,00:43:16,like there's a big sort of international competition
00:43:16,00:43:18,for who can drink the most Scotch.
00:43:18,00:43:20,"- Per-old Latvia coming second,"
00:43:20,00:43:21,desperately trying to catch up.
00:43:21,00:43:22,- Are they second Latvia?
00:43:22,00:43:23,- Latvia a second. - Really?
00:43:23,00:43:24,- Yeah.
00:43:24,00:43:26,- A bottle of Scotch per person per month.
00:43:26,00:43:27,- Isn't that insane?
00:43:27,00:43:28,- That is a lot.
00:43:28,00:43:31,"- Latvia has their own, what is it now?"
00:43:31,00:43:32,I have some at home.
00:43:32,00:43:35,It's like schnapps-y stuff that Latvians drink.
00:43:35,00:43:37,"So, and they have balsam as well."
00:43:37,00:43:38,"- Balsam, yeah."
00:43:38,00:43:40,"- So like, they're spreading themselves too thin,"
00:43:40,00:43:42,"the Latvians, I didn't say that."
00:43:42,00:43:42,- You're right.
00:43:42,00:43:43,- I could call.
00:43:43,00:43:45,"- Give up the balsam and having tasted the balsam,"
00:43:45,00:43:46,just give up the balsam.
00:43:46,00:43:48,"- Yeah, and then you'll win."
00:43:48,00:43:49,- Stick with the whiskey.
00:43:49,00:43:52,- So a bottle per person per month.
00:43:52,00:43:54,- Or they buy a bottle of Scotch per person per month.
00:43:54,00:43:55,And I think that's an important distinction
00:43:55,00:43:58,'cause I struggled to really find the reason.
00:43:58,00:44:00,"- 'Cause I, like, I've got a bottle of whiskey at home"
00:44:00,00:44:02,and I've been working on it pretty solidly
00:44:02,00:44:03,for a couple of years now.
00:44:03,00:44:05,"And I mean, like, I've got past the halfway mark."
00:44:05,00:44:08,But is all this whiskey being drunk
00:44:08,00:44:10,or is it that it's just being bought and stored?
00:44:10,00:44:12,"- Well, it's not clear."
00:44:12,00:44:14,So the stats are from the Scotch Whiskey Association.
00:44:14,00:44:18,"So, which says that they export 12.76 bottles a year."
00:44:18,00:44:20,They have all the export figures.
00:44:20,00:44:22,"In case you're wondering, domestically,"
00:44:22,00:44:23,"in case you're wondering,"
00:44:23,00:44:26,"""Oh, the Scottish surely drink more."""
00:44:26,00:44:29,73 million bottles are sold domestically in the UK each year.
00:44:29,00:44:32,So even if every single UK bottle of whiskey
00:44:32,00:44:34,"was sold in Scotland,"
00:44:34,00:44:36,they'd only just be drinking as much whiskey
00:44:36,00:44:38,as the Singaporeans.
00:44:38,00:44:40,"- And we know that Andy's having, you know?"
00:44:40,00:44:42,- Andy's getting through.
00:44:42,00:44:45,"- Working away on my famous grass, yeah."
00:44:45,00:44:46,- I've still got a bottle of whiskey in my house
00:44:46,00:44:49,"that I bought on my honeymoon, which was 12 years ago."
00:44:49,00:44:50,- Really?
00:44:50,00:44:51,- Thank you.
00:44:51,00:44:52,- Is that for aging purposes?
00:44:52,00:44:53,"- No, we only,"
00:44:53,00:44:56,I only use it for whiskey sauce on Burns Night once a year.
00:44:56,00:45:00,"- Is it, it's not unbelievably delicious whiskey,"
00:45:00,00:45:01,is it that you're wasting on it?
00:45:01,00:45:02,"- It's telescope, it's pretty good."
00:45:02,00:45:03,"- Oh, really?"
00:45:03,00:45:04,- Yeah.
00:45:04,00:45:05,"- Okay, well, we're not contributing"
00:45:05,00:45:07,"to the English stats, obviously."
00:45:07,00:45:08,But it's weird.
00:45:08,00:45:09,I was looking it up.
00:45:09,00:45:11,Singaporeans very light drinkers.
00:45:11,00:45:14,"They consume two litres of alcohol per person per year,"
00:45:14,00:45:19,which is about five times less than we do as Brits.
00:45:19,00:45:20,"And it seems to be,"
00:45:20,00:45:22,"when I was looking at like people talking about it,"
00:45:22,00:45:24,"Singaporeans talking about it, it is about investment."
00:45:24,00:45:27,And a lot of them are buying up whiskey now.
00:45:27,00:45:28,It's become a trendy thing.
00:45:28,00:45:29,It's a pretty wealthy country.
00:45:29,00:45:31,"- Well, there's a lot of expats as well, so."
00:45:31,00:45:33,"- Lots of expats, yeah, that's true."
00:45:33,00:45:35,- Who will skew the number of people and what they drink.
00:45:35,00:45:37,"- If I go as a tourist to Singapore,"
00:45:37,00:45:38,"'cause I know it's a whiskey hub,"
00:45:38,00:45:40,'cause then they've got lots of amazing whiskey
00:45:40,00:45:42,"from around the world and whiskey shops and things,"
00:45:42,00:45:43,and I buy a bottle there.
00:45:43,00:45:44,"Does that count, do you think?"
00:45:44,00:45:46,"- A Judy Free Sitch, yeah."
00:45:46,00:45:47,"- I've never been except, I think,"
00:45:47,00:45:49,briefly to the airport once.
00:45:49,00:45:50,But it sounds like an amazing--
00:45:50,00:45:52,"- The airport is nice, in fairness."
00:45:52,00:45:54,"- And again, I didn't go specifically to--"
00:45:54,00:45:56,(all laughing)
00:45:56,00:45:57,"- I just went into Changi,"
00:45:57,00:46:00,"couple of glasses of whiskey, straight back out."
00:46:00,00:46:02,I'm half a glass of whiskey today.
00:46:02,00:46:03,I think that's a record.
00:46:03,00:46:05,(all laughing)
00:46:07,00:46:09,- But it's an amazingly weird place.
00:46:09,00:46:10,"- It's cool, I've been."
00:46:10,00:46:12,"- Yeah, yeah, I went a lot as a kid."
00:46:12,00:46:14,- I suppose it's not far from there.
00:46:14,00:46:16,"So it's right at the bottom of Malaysia,"
00:46:16,00:46:18,"and it's much like Portsmouth in that it's an island,"
00:46:18,00:46:20,but it's separated by a very narrow strip of water
00:46:20,00:46:22,"from the rest of the mainland, as it were."
00:46:22,00:46:23,"- Portsmouth, the south."
00:46:23,00:46:25,- It's the Portsmouth of the south.
00:46:25,00:46:26,"- When you learn in Singapore,"
00:46:26,00:46:29,"there's a big banner that says much like Portsmouth, welcome."
00:46:29,00:46:33,"- Here's another thing they drink there, Yakult."
00:46:33,00:46:34,- Oh yeah?
00:46:34,00:46:38,"- So you know Yakult, that kind of little sort of yogurty drink"
00:46:38,00:46:40,with probiotics in it.
00:46:40,00:46:42,Singapore is the only country in the world
00:46:42,00:46:44,that sells different flavors of Yakult.
00:46:44,00:46:46,- Is it?
00:46:46,00:46:49,"- Interesting, so just a childhood thing,"
00:46:49,00:46:52,"Yakult was massive in my childhood in Hong Kong,"
00:46:52,00:46:55,but I can't picture another flavor other than the basic.
00:46:55,00:46:57,"- Well, honestly, they only do it in Singapore."
00:46:57,00:46:59,They also have the biggest serving size
00:46:59,00:47:01,"of anywhere in the world, which is 100 milliliters."
00:47:01,00:47:03,Now you can get that one in Hong Kong as well.
00:47:03,00:47:05,"You can get that in a few countries,"
00:47:05,00:47:06,"but you can't get it in the UK,"
00:47:06,00:47:07,but you can get it in Singapore.
00:47:07,00:47:09,- You mean of spirits?
00:47:09,00:47:10,"- No, sorry, of Yakult."
00:47:10,00:47:10,- Yakult.
00:47:10,00:47:11,- Yakult was the only Yakult.
00:47:11,00:47:13,"- It's like a novelty Toblerone, right?"
00:47:13,00:47:14,Like it's a--
00:47:14,00:47:16,"- Yeah, and also in Singapore,"
00:47:16,00:47:18,this is the only place they have it.
00:47:18,00:47:20,"They have a Yakult home delivery service,"
00:47:20,00:47:23,"which started in 1986,"
00:47:23,00:47:26,and they will bring you your Yakult to your door
00:47:26,00:47:26,if you want it.
00:47:26,00:47:28,- Jesus Christ.
00:47:28,00:47:29,Their gut health must be out of this world.
00:47:29,00:47:32,(all laughing)
00:47:32,00:47:33,- That's amazing.
00:47:33,00:47:34,- Isn't that weird?
00:47:34,00:47:35,- 'Cause it's an island.
00:47:35,00:47:37,"It's got this kind of island culture,"
00:47:37,00:47:39,"you know, where just things are popular there"
00:47:39,00:47:39,that aren't popular anywhere else.
00:47:39,00:47:43,Like they've got the world's first ever salmon ATM there.
00:47:43,00:47:44,"- Okay, yeah."
00:47:44,00:47:45,- It's a vending machine.
00:47:45,00:47:47,"In fact, there are dozens of vending machines"
00:47:47,00:47:49,specifically for Norwegian salmon.
00:47:49,00:47:50,- But the salmon always try and swim back
00:47:50,00:47:52,into the vending machine.
00:47:52,00:47:54,(all laughing)
00:47:54,00:47:55,"- Yeah, it's bizarre."
00:47:55,00:47:59,"Norwegian salmon, there were 61 as of 2019,"
00:47:59,00:48:01,but it stays fresh in there for two years.
00:48:01,00:48:02,- Salmon?
00:48:02,00:48:02,- 'Cause it's frozen.
00:48:02,00:48:03,"- Oh, okay."
00:48:03,00:48:04,"- Oh, you know."
00:48:04,00:48:05,- Okay.
00:48:05,00:48:07,"- Like Singapore, when you go there,"
00:48:07,00:48:09,"and this is again from the viewpoint of a kid,"
00:48:09,00:48:11,it's not particularly weird.
00:48:11,00:48:13,It was a bit intimidating because of the rules.
00:48:13,00:48:16,"You were always told, can't chew gum there."
00:48:16,00:48:17,That's illegal.
00:48:17,00:48:19,You will be lashed if you chew gum.
00:48:19,00:48:21,- I remember the teller of that.
00:48:21,00:48:22,"- Yeah, I remember every time I would go there,"
00:48:22,00:48:24,"just being like, wow, it's so clean here."
00:48:24,00:48:25,"And yeah, there's a reason for that."
00:48:25,00:48:26,"- I've just realized,"
00:48:26,00:48:28,"'cause I remember thinking that as well,"
00:48:28,00:48:30,"but maybe I misunderstood,"
00:48:30,00:48:32,"'cause if they're all drinking so much Scotch,"
00:48:32,00:48:34,and they're all getting lashed every day.
00:48:34,00:48:37,(all laughing)
00:48:37,00:48:38,Maybe that's what it meant all along.
00:48:38,00:48:41,"- Yeah, no, it is pretty wild."
00:48:41,00:48:42,"I was surprised actually,"
00:48:42,00:48:44,that the number one imported drink isn't gin.
00:48:44,00:48:47,"That's just because simply of the Singapore Sling,"
00:48:47,00:48:50,the most famous drink to have the name Singapore
00:48:50,00:48:51,in front of it.
00:48:51,00:48:53,- What's the second most famous?
00:48:53,00:48:54,"- There are no others, so yeah."
00:48:54,00:48:56,But that is a massive drink there.
00:48:56,00:48:59,"It was invented in Raffles, the hotel,"
00:48:59,00:49:01,which is an extraordinary hotel.
00:49:01,00:49:03,I don't know if you've ever seen pictures of it.
00:49:03,00:49:04,But you've been to Raffles.
00:49:04,00:49:06,"- In fact, I've had a Singapore Sling there."
00:49:06,00:49:06,- Have you?
00:49:06,00:49:07,"So yeah, they say they, at the bar,"
00:49:07,00:49:09,"which is called the Long Bar,"
00:49:09,00:49:11,"they say that about 2,000 Singapore Slings"
00:49:11,00:49:13,are made per day.
00:49:13,00:49:15,"- I gotta say, I ordered one, had a sip,"
00:49:15,00:49:17,and then ordered a beer.
00:49:17,00:49:18,"- Right, really?"
00:49:18,00:49:18,- I did not like it at all.
00:49:18,00:49:19,- 'Cause you didn't like it?
00:49:19,00:49:20,"- Yeah, it's too sweet and sour."
00:49:20,00:49:22,"- Yeah, it was basically invented"
00:49:22,00:49:23,"by one of the bar staff there,"
00:49:23,00:49:26,because women were not really allowed to drink publicly.
00:49:26,00:49:29,"And so you make this with pineapple and lime,"
00:49:29,00:49:31,"and you put the gin in,"
00:49:31,00:49:32,but it looks like they're just having a nice fresh juice.
00:49:32,00:49:34,And so that's kind of how it kicked off.
00:49:34,00:49:36,"James, when you went to that bar,"
00:49:36,00:49:38,did you notice as you walk
00:49:38,00:49:41,that your feet were crunching everywhere on shells?
00:49:41,00:49:42,- Some classy shells?
00:49:42,00:49:43,- No.
00:49:43,00:49:44,- I don't recall that.
00:49:44,00:49:46,"I don't remember it very well, to be honest,"
00:49:46,00:49:47,"'cause it was quite a lot of years ago,"
00:49:47,00:49:49,"but no, I don't think so."
00:49:49,00:49:50,I remember it being very colonial.
00:49:50,00:49:52,"- Right, so they have peanuts there"
00:49:52,00:49:54,"that they give to you in bags,"
00:49:54,00:49:55,"but they don't give you a plate to put the shells on,"
00:49:55,00:49:57,because it is tradition to throw them on the floor
00:49:57,00:49:58,immediately after you've eaten them.
00:49:58,00:49:59,"- Oh, really?"
00:49:59,00:50:01,"- At the end of the day, they just have to sweep up"
00:50:01,00:50:04,all the discarded shells that are sitting there.
00:50:04,00:50:05,- Nice for the cleaning staff.
00:50:05,00:50:06,Do they appreciate that tradition?
00:50:06,00:50:08,All those migrant laborer cleaning staff?
00:50:08,00:50:10,"- It's part of it, yeah."
00:50:10,00:50:12,"And also, here's a really interesting fact."
00:50:12,00:50:14,It is located on number one beach road.
00:50:14,00:50:17,"However, there is no beach near it."
00:50:17,00:50:19,Riddle me this.
00:50:19,00:50:22,- Did there used to be a beach near it?
00:50:22,00:50:25,"- There used to be, and there's so much reclaimed land."
00:50:25,00:50:27,"- Oh, it wasn't named after Dylan Thomas's wife,"
00:50:27,00:50:29,he was a nymphomaniac and a beach.
00:50:29,00:50:31,(all laughing)
00:50:31,00:50:32,- First class beach on that.
00:50:32,00:50:34,(all laughing)
00:50:34,00:50:35,- There's that wild.
00:50:35,00:50:37,There used to be a beach right at the edge of it.
00:50:37,00:50:40,It's on beach road and so much land has been added
00:50:40,00:50:41,that it's no longer in sight.
00:50:41,00:50:45,- And Singapore is 20% larger than it was in the '60s.
00:50:45,00:50:49,"And it's basically taken the land from Malaysia and Indonesia,"
00:50:49,00:50:51,"which you would think sounds like a war,"
00:50:51,00:50:55,but they've not gone to war and taken the land in that way.
00:50:55,00:50:57,"They've gone over there, taken all the sand,"
00:50:57,00:51:00,and then created new land in Singapore.
00:51:00,00:51:02,So the sand comes from different countries.
00:51:02,00:51:05,"It's Malaysian land, it's Indonesian sand,"
00:51:05,00:51:07,but it's made Singapore 20% larger.
00:51:07,00:51:09,"- And it's very controversial 'cause it's drained,"
00:51:09,00:51:11,"like they've banned it in Indonesia,"
00:51:11,00:51:12,they banned it a while ago.
00:51:12,00:51:14,"They've officially, I think almost all of it comes"
00:51:14,00:51:16,from Cambodia now because it got banned elsewhere.
00:51:16,00:51:19,"Cambodia banned it, but you can still make a huge amount"
00:51:19,00:51:21,of money as a Cambodian who's willing to get your sacks out
00:51:21,00:51:24,and collect loads of sand and export it.
00:51:24,00:51:25,"- Sounds muggling, yeah."
00:51:25,00:51:26,"- 'Cause it is, I think a lot of stuff"
00:51:26,00:51:28,about Singapore is to do with the fact it's so small.
00:51:28,00:51:30,And they import so much of their food
00:51:30,00:51:32,that they have to have innovative solutions
00:51:32,00:51:35,for feeding themselves and supplying their own stuff.
00:51:35,00:51:37,- And they've smashed that.
00:51:37,00:51:38,"It was always the chart when I went,"
00:51:38,00:51:40,"I mean, which it was 20 years ago, but I think it's the same."
00:51:40,00:51:43,The only two things people ever told you about Singapore
00:51:43,00:51:45,"and no offense to Singaporeans, I know there's more,"
00:51:45,00:51:48,but the airport's amazing and the food's incredible.
00:51:48,00:51:49,"And actually, when you live for three days,"
00:51:49,00:51:52,"once you know the food is the only thing really to do there,"
00:51:52,00:51:55,"once you've had kind of four meals in a row,"
00:51:55,00:51:57,"it's like, ""Well, I can't enjoy this anymore."
00:51:57,00:51:58,"What am I gonna do now?"""
00:51:58,00:51:59,- How can you stop enjoying food?
00:51:59,00:52:01,- I've had them within about two hours.
00:52:01,00:52:04,He's just gone round stuffing your face.
00:52:04,00:52:05,"- Actually, I just thought of something"
00:52:05,00:52:09,"that they did in Singapore that's like the NFL stuff,"
00:52:09,00:52:14,which is they turn the car parks into like food halls.
00:52:14,00:52:14,"- Oh, really?"
00:52:14,00:52:15,- I'm sure they do that.
00:52:15,00:52:17,"Yeah, I remember going to, it was like an old car park."
00:52:17,00:52:20,"Once the car park closed and all the cars had gone,"
00:52:20,00:52:24,suddenly it just opens up and they sell durian and--
00:52:24,00:52:25,"- Yeah, okay, that sounds likely."
00:52:25,00:52:26,"- That's the big thing, isn't it?"
00:52:26,00:52:27,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:52:27,00:52:29,- There's like one huge food hall.
00:52:29,00:52:32,"- Graves, 'cause there's so little space going."
00:52:32,00:52:34,- They have to be all shaped like bananas
00:52:34,00:52:37,"and they kind of tessellate with each other, don't they?"
00:52:37,00:52:39,- They're all spooning.
00:52:39,00:52:40,"- Oh, sweet."
00:52:40,00:52:41,"- No, you get, they're digging up,"
00:52:41,00:52:43,there used to be a couple of hundred cemeteries
00:52:43,00:52:45,"in Singapore, now there are only about 60 left,"
00:52:45,00:52:47,because they just need space.
00:52:47,00:52:49,You get 15 years only in the ground
00:52:49,00:52:52,if you choose to be buried and then you have to go elsewhere.
00:52:52,00:52:53,"- Obviously, as we've said,"
00:52:53,00:52:55,they're kind of big on their rules
00:52:55,00:52:59,and trying to stop people from doing certain things.
00:52:59,00:53:02,There was an anti-gambling advert in 2014
00:53:02,00:53:05,and this featured a little boy called Andy
00:53:05,00:53:06,and he was complaining to his friends
00:53:06,00:53:09,that his dad had bet his life savings
00:53:09,00:53:11,on Germany winning the World Cup
00:53:11,00:53:14,and Germany then won the 2014 World Cup.
00:53:14,00:53:17,(all laughing)
00:53:17,00:53:22,And the National Council on Problem Gambling said
00:53:22,00:53:23,that they decided to choose Germany
00:53:23,00:53:25,"because they thought they were very unlikely to win,"
00:53:25,00:53:28,but at least it would be realistic.
00:53:28,00:53:30,- You can never bet against the Germans in a World Cup.
00:53:30,00:53:32,"- Exactly, they should have known."
00:53:32,00:53:33,But obviously everyone thought
00:53:33,00:53:36,that this was encouraging people to gamble.
00:53:36,00:53:38,So the council revamped the advert
00:53:38,00:53:41,"and Andy, the little boy says, his friend asks,"
00:53:41,00:53:43,"""Your dad's team won, did you get your money back?"""
00:53:43,00:53:45,"And he said, ""No, dad never stops,"
00:53:45,00:53:47,"he wants to bet one more time,"""
00:53:47,00:53:49,on which he bet on Leicester winning
00:53:49,00:53:50,the next year's Premier League.
00:53:50,00:53:51,(all laughing)
00:53:51,00:53:52,"- No, he didn't."
00:53:52,00:53:54,(all laughing)
00:53:54,00:53:55,- That's so funny.
00:53:55,00:53:56,"Yeah, lots of things banned."
00:53:56,00:53:58,That's the only thing I know.
00:53:58,00:53:59,"Chewing gum, I know, obviously."
00:53:59,00:54:02,"But I mean, it's pretty draconian there, isn't it?"
00:54:02,00:54:05,So you can still be caned if you're a man under the age of 50.
00:54:05,00:54:06,- Another euphemism for getting drunk.
00:54:06,00:54:08,"- Oh no, yeah, you're right."
00:54:08,00:54:09,"But you can really, like, they have a cane"
00:54:09,00:54:12,"and they will, and it's sort of minor levels of crime,"
00:54:12,00:54:14,but it's really painful.
00:54:14,00:54:15,"Like, it's really bad."
00:54:15,00:54:16,And there are all sorts of rumours
00:54:16,00:54:17,"about the procedure, it just, it's just--"
00:54:17,00:54:20,"- I thought that J-Walking could get you caned,"
00:54:20,00:54:22,"like, is what I thought when I went there."
00:54:22,00:54:23,"I don't know if it was true, but--"
00:54:23,00:54:26,- Mine of vandalism does.
00:54:26,00:54:28,"- Weeing in a lift, Dan, you were there as a child,"
00:54:28,00:54:29,did you say?
00:54:29,00:54:32,"- Not at that age, but yeah."
00:54:32,00:54:33,- 'Cause they had a huge problem
00:54:33,00:54:35,with people weeing in the lift.
00:54:35,00:54:35,"- Sorry, sorry."
00:54:35,00:54:38,"At what age did you stop weeing in the lift, Dan?"
00:54:38,00:54:39,(all laughing)
00:54:39,00:54:40,- Like 23.
00:54:40,00:54:42,(all laughing)
00:54:42,00:54:44,- You're Dylan Thomas' face.
00:54:44,00:54:46,(all laughing)
00:54:46,00:54:48,"- Yeah, 'cause everyone lives in high-rise buildings,"
00:54:48,00:54:50,"and in the '60s and '70s,"
00:54:50,00:54:53,"every lift stank of piss, and it was horrible,"
00:54:53,00:54:55,"and they had suggestions of how do we combat this,"
00:54:55,00:54:57,'cause it's a really nasty social problem.
00:54:57,00:54:59,"One block of flats just bought its own lift attendant,"
00:54:59,00:55:00,"like everyone chipped in,"
00:55:00,00:55:02,"and you'd have someone to, you know, press the buttons,"
00:55:02,00:55:04,but also stop anyone weeing.
00:55:04,00:55:07,"And eventually, in the 1988 war on piss,"
00:55:07,00:55:11,"they installed urine detectors in lifts,"
00:55:11,00:55:12,"and had a crack down,"
00:55:12,00:55:15,"and if a drop of weed hits the floor,"
00:55:15,00:55:16,"that urine detector detects it,"
00:55:16,00:55:18,"the lift slams to a halt,"
00:55:18,00:55:21,and you have to wait there until the authorities come
00:55:21,00:55:23,and drag you off to Chokey.
00:55:23,00:55:24,- Oh my God.
00:55:24,00:55:25,"- And the first people calling for it,"
00:55:25,00:55:27,"were I think, you know, boys who were just sort of..."
00:55:27,00:55:30,"- I wanna know, 'cause they had this problem"
00:55:30,00:55:33,in other countries that most people live in high-rise.
00:55:33,00:55:36,You're so close to home when you're in a lift.
00:55:36,00:55:37,- What if you're going out?
00:55:37,00:55:39,(all laughing)
00:55:39,00:55:42,"- It feels like go before you leave, right?"
00:55:42,00:55:44,It just feels like you're so close
00:55:44,00:55:47,"to having either just left your toilet,"
00:55:47,00:55:48,or just arriving at your toilet.
00:55:48,00:55:50,- But you know what it's like.
00:55:50,00:55:51,"When you really need the loo,"
00:55:51,00:55:52,you suddenly can't hold it anymore
00:55:52,00:55:54,"when you're 10 yards from your front door, right?"
00:55:54,00:55:55,"- Yeah, you let your guard down a bit, and then..."
00:55:55,00:55:57,"- Exactly, you relax."
00:55:57,00:55:59,- I don't think it's people who are incapable.
00:55:59,00:56:01,I don't think it's people who are almost home
00:56:01,00:56:02,who just can't hold it anymore.
00:56:02,00:56:03,I think it was just a...
00:56:03,00:56:05,"I don't know, if I was visiting your home though, James,"
00:56:05,00:56:06,I might we in the lift on the way up
00:56:06,00:56:08,just to kind of mark the territory.
00:56:08,00:56:10,- Why don't I live in a ground floor flat?
00:56:10,00:56:12,(all laughing)
00:56:12,00:56:15,"- Through the front window, or whatever it might be."
00:56:15,00:56:17,(upbeat music)
00:56:18,00:56:20,(upbeat music)
00:56:20,00:56:21,"- Okay, that's it."
