00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
 [Music]

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,400
 Hi everybody, it's Andy and James here from No Such Thing as a Fish.

3
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:07,880
 Hi, your favourite too.

4
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:09,440
 [Laughs]

5
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:10,320
 Shhh.

6
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:11,520
 But, yes.

7
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:13,400
 Now we're here with a little topper show announcement

8
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:16,360
 because we've got some secret juicy gossip for you.

9
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:17,520
 We sure have.

10
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:20,880
 And that gossip is that we are going to be doing some live shows.

11
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:22,320
 You didn't hear it from us.

12
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,320
 But if you go to King's Place in London

13
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:27,040
 on the 5th and 6th of September,

14
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:30,200
 you can see not one, but two No Such Thing as a Fish live shows.

15
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:32,040
 Dan and Anna will also be there for clarity.

16
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:33,880
 Anna will not be there for clarity.

17
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:35,440
 Yeah, sorry, yeah.

18
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:36,760
 Dan will be.

19
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:38,880
 And some very, very special guests.

20
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:41,800
 Now, we have already booked one of these special guests

21
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:45,320
 and I promise you, if I mentioned the name of that person right now,

22
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:47,000
 we would sell out in seconds.

23
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:47,760
 That's right.

24
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:51,000
 And if it does sell out, there are streaming tickets available too.

25
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,480
 You can watch the show live.

26
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:56,840
 See what it's like when we're not rigorously and scrupulously edited.

27
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:00,560
 Here, all the stuff we say that really should be edited out

28
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:02,080
 by getting a streaming ticket.

29
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:04,400
 And where do you get those tickets from, Andy?

30
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,480
 I think if they just go to our website, there'll be a link.

31
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:08,080
 No such thing as a fish.com.

32
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:08,840
 Excellent.

33
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:10,080
 Well, do that right now.

34
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,120
 But in the meantime, it's time to say,

35
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:14,560
 on with the podcast, on with the show.

36
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:38,480
 Hello and welcome to another episode of no such thing as a fish,

37
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:42,520
 a weekly podcast coming to you from the QI offices in Hoburn.

38
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:43,760
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

39
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:47,080
 I am sitting here with James Harkin, Andrew Hunter Murray,

40
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:48,320
 and Anna Tyshinski.

41
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:50,280
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones

42
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:52,920
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days.

43
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:56,480
 And in no particular order, here we go.

44
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:59,280
 Starting with fact number one, and that is my fact.

45
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,920
 My fact this week is that before he was buried,

46
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:06,600
 the poet Dylan Thomas was used as a poker table.

47
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,600
 That doesn't feel very practical.

48
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:09,120
 No.

49
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:11,000
 The chicks are going to go everywhere.

50
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,800
 And I imagine as a poet, you're wearing

51
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,600
 a lot of ruffles, maybe a cravat.

52
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,480
 You know, you're not going to be a smooth table.

53
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:18,360
 No. OK.

54
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:21,800
 So it's not his body that was physically used as the poker

55
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:25,680
 table. Dylan Thomas, as a bit of backstory, had been in America

56
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,920
 and he died on the 9th of November, 1953.

57
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:31,000
 Let's get right to the, let's cut to the chase.

58
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,200
 Was he born before he died?

59
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:34,760
 I need to know all the context, Dan.

60
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:36,000
 So yeah, it was really unfortunate.

61
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,200
 He was 39 years old.

62
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,240
 He was a big drinker.

63
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:40,480
 There's a bit of mystery about what actually caused his death.

64
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,000
 But there we have it, the facts.

65
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,440
 He dies November, 1953.

66
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:47,760
 His wife, Caitlin, decides she doesn't want him to be buried

67
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:48,320
 in America.

68
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:51,160
 She wants to bring him back home to Wales, his home country.

69
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:51,480
 Yeah.

70
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:54,400
 And so she puts him on a ship and he's in the hold.

71
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:57,120
 And one night she's a bit disruptive upstairs

72
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,640
 and she gets sent downstairs.

73
00:02:58,640 --> 00:02:59,920
 And it just so happens that she's

74
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:02,000
 bunking up very near to his coffin.

75
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,920
 And she notices that all the sailors gather around the coffin

76
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:06,880
 and use it as the poker table.

77
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:09,000
 And she thought he would have loved this.

78
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:09,920
 Yeah.

79
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:12,120
 So was it not obviously a coffin?

80
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:12,920
 I think it might have been.

81
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:15,000
 They might not have cared.

82
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,280
 That's quite a macabre.

83
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,200
 I would have tried to find another table

84
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,760
 or just a packing crate or something.

85
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:21,160
 Would you?

86
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,680
 I would have gone out my way to find the coffin.

87
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:22,920
 Yeah.

88
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,200
 If you had there's a coffin on board.

89
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:27,400
 I genuinely think when I go, if I could organize it

90
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:30,000
 that my mates had a poker game on my coffin

91
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,440
 and they didn't mind, then I'd be down for that.

92
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:34,600
 It would be more golf for you, though, wouldn't it?

93
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,600
 That's hard to play in a coffin.

94
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,760
 Right.

95
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:39,880
 You could be the last hole.

96
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:42,760
 The 19th hole.

97
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:45,560
 I'm hoping that I'm laid down face up, actually.

98
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:52,960
 Apparently, like you said, there was some ruckus with Caitlyn.

99
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:56,440
 I read that she was in a cabin with, and I quote,

100
00:03:56,440 --> 00:04:00,240
 some sort of glamor queen that she really didn't like.

101
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,080
 And so she deliberately caused a ruckus

102
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,120
 so that she would get kicked out of that cabin.

103
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,160
 Yeah.

104
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:07,440
 Yeah, having now read up about Caitlyn,

105
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:10,360
 I wonder if that's true or if she was just generally causing

106
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:12,120
 ruckus, because that was the thing about them.

107
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:14,400
 They were sort of described as the prototype

108
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,360
 Sid and Nancy of the sex pistols.

109
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:18,360
 They were a couple that were destructive.

110
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,720
 They'd get huge fights.

111
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,480
 They would get drunk everywhere they went.

112
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:23,760
 But what's crazy is that when Caitlyn got back,

113
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:26,960
 she went on a pub crawl with the person who picked her up.

114
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,800
 And Dylan was just left in the car park in the coffin

115
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:32,480
 while they were getting pissed along the way in all the pubs

116
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,200
 towards where his home was going to be.

117
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,240
 Yeah.

118
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:39,680
 Did you find the claim that he was buried in a banana-shaped

119
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,160
 grave?

120
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:43,640
 No.

121
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:44,480
 No.

122
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,920
 OK, so we should say, also, most famous Welsh poet,

123
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,760
 arguably, I'd say, ever?

124
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:49,680
 For me, he is.

125
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,880
 I mean, he's barred territory.

126
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:53,800
 If someone asked me the name of a Welsh poet,

127
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:54,760
 he would be the one.

128
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:55,440
 Exactly.

129
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:58,880
 And he certainly was barred from most of his local pubs.

130
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:02,600
 Well, there is a claim, I read, that the grave digger was

131
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:05,760
 Defan Mute, and he only knew that he was burying a man whose

132
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:07,520
 favorite fruit was the banana.

133
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:11,400
 So in tribute, he originally dug a banana-shaped grave

134
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,360
 before being told off and told the grave digger.

135
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,480
 Now, I just think if you're a professional grave digger,

136
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:18,440
 you know that you very rarely get a banana-shaped coffin.

137
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:19,240
 Yeah.

138
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:21,880
 Do we know that his favorite fruit was banana?

139
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:24,520
 Do you know, the original thing is so untrue that I haven't

140
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:28,000
 even saw that yet.

141
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,360
 I thought Defan Mute sounds like a Welsh name.

142
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:33,880
 I thought that was a name.

143
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:36,560
 So his death, Dan, you said that there was some weird things

144
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,120
 about that.

145
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:37,840
 Yeah.

146
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:42,320
 There was the idea that he drank so much that the night

147
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:45,960
 before he went into a coma, which then led to him going

148
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,600
 to hospital and eventually dying,

149
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:51,000
 he claimed to have drunk 18 whiskeys.

150
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,160
 Also the line, say the line.

151
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:56,800
 Supposedly his last words were, I've just drunk 18

152
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:57,600
 straight whiskeys.

153
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,640
 I think that's a record or something like that.

154
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:00,600
 That's a great line.

155
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,840
 But that's not true, is it?

156
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:04,040
 He definitely said things after that.

157
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:06,760
 I think he did say that, actually, in fairness.

158
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:09,520
 But it was the day before and then the next day,

159
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:12,120
 he did talk to people and said different things.

160
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:15,840
 He said, God, kill for a banana right now.

161
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,640
 So it was the doctor's fault, right?

162
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:21,120
 So yeah, so he was sedated with some morphine.

163
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,320
 And he went into a coma.

164
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:24,280
 And he had pneumonia, which hadn't been diagnosed.

165
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:25,720
 And that was the problem with the morphine.

166
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,120
 But this is the interesting thing.

167
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,960
 I think it's actually Dylan Thomas' fault.

168
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,720
 Because he did make that joke about having

169
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,400
 had all these whiskeys, right?

170
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,800
 And then I believe his friend who'd overheard that,

171
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,480
 when he was really ill, said to the doctor,

172
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,640
 oh, well, he told me yesterday he'd had 18 straight whiskeys.

173
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:42,440
 So the doctor very naturally assumes alcohol poisoning

174
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:44,320
 and then gives him the morphine,

175
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:46,280
 which puts him into the coma, which kills him.

176
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:49,000
 So actually Dylan Thomas died of his own joke,

177
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,800
 as well as medical misdiagnosis and all of that.

178
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,480
 But basically it's because his friend said,

179
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,760
 oh yeah, well, this is what he was saying.

180
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:56,400
 - Well, it's possible he wasn't joking though,

181
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,800
 because they went and interviewed the bartender

182
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,360
 who was serving drinks at night.

183
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:03,240
 And he said he didn't drink 18, absolutely not.

184
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:06,440
 But someone pointed out that a shot in America

185
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:08,880
 versus a shot back home is three times the amount.

186
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:11,080
 So they think in his incredibly drunken state,

187
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:14,240
 Dylan Thomas was doing math and worked out

188
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,960
 how many that would have been back home, which was 18.

189
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:20,640
 - Yeah, in fairness, the math was only three times six.

190
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,800
 - But once you've had 18 whiskeys.

191
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:27,160
 - He actually wasn't good at taking his drink.

192
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:29,840
 He's got this reputation for being such a heavy drinker.

193
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,520
 But I think people who knew him said actually,

194
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:32,800
 he was kind of a lightweight.

195
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,480
 So maybe he just seemed pissed a lot.

196
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:37,560
 He had a famous sort of relationship slash,

197
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,800
 what's an enemy ship?

198
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:40,720
 - Frenemy?

199
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:41,640
 - He was sort of a frenemy,

200
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:44,480
 but without the fruit of it with Kingsley Amos,

201
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:45,440
 who only met him once,

202
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:48,600
 but used to write really awful things about his poetry.

203
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,440
 - Okay.

204
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,560
 - And Amos met him in 1951.

205
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:53,600
 And he said he was an outstandingly unpleasant man

206
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,200
 who cheated and stole from his friends

207
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,840
 and peed on their carpets.

208
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:59,640
 And he boozed a lot because it fitted his image as a poet

209
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:02,000
 rather than out of any thirst or need.

210
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,040
 - I think people, quite a lot of people

211
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:06,760
 didn't really like him very much, even his friends.

212
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:09,200
 - No, it's a shame if you like his poetry to read up on him

213
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,640
 because it makes him quite unlikable, doesn't it?

214
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:12,760
 - I think he considered himself to be a poet,

215
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:15,560
 which meant he didn't need to get a proper job.

216
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:19,480
 He could just sort of dilettantishly turn up at people's houses

217
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:22,400
 and sleep on their sofas and urinate on their carpets.

218
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,120
 Perhaps, I don't know.

219
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:26,000
 But yeah, like one of his really good friends,

220
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,400
 Norman Cameron, he wrote, "Who invited him in?

221
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:30,440
 What was he doing here?

222
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:33,840
 That insolent little ruffian, that crappulous lout?

223
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:36,840
 When he quitted a sofa, he left behind a smear."

224
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,680
 - Oh dear.

225
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:40,080
 - That's what his friends thought of him,

226
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,160
 what of his enemies.

227
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:43,960
 - Right, but his fans kind of loved it, right?

228
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:46,880
 They loved this image of a drunken poet

229
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,920
 who was living up to that romantic idea

230
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:51,440
 that they're sitting in a shed with a glass of whiskey,

231
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,920
 writing these incredible lines.

232
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:55,560
 And in his final eight years, you know, he died 39,

233
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:58,160
 as I said, in the final eight years, he wrote six poems.

234
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,200
 He spent basically the last period of his life

235
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:03,560
 going on tours and talking and reading out his poems.

236
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:06,040
 He became an orator as opposed to a writer.

237
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:09,680
 And people would go because it was quite rock and roll.

238
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,920
 Is Dylan Thomas gonna swear at someone in the crowd?

239
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,280
 Is he gonna drunkenly fall off the stage and pass out?

240
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:16,120
 - Is he gonna leave a smear on the sofa?

241
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,920
 (all laughing)

242
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,160
 - The curtain comes up and says,

243
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:22,720
 "That's a sofa on the stage, get it Dylan!"

244
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:25,000
 But he was kind of, you know, people were into that.

245
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,440
 - I think he was less hard living in lots of ways.

246
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:31,320
 So he lived for a while in a place called Lawn

247
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:34,600
 and the Thomas family GP, the doctor,

248
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,560
 wrote he didn't do any womanizing.

249
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:37,600
 He was pretty sober.

250
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,040
 He was very respectful.

251
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:41,760
 He started the day by helping his dad

252
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,240
 with the times crossword every morning.

253
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,320
 Apparently his capacity for drink, I'm quoting now,

254
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:49,080
 was very limited compared with the average hearty.

255
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,240
 He couldn't drink very much.

256
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,800
 Three or four pints was his absolute limit.

257
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,040
 But then of his wife, Caitlyn, the doctor wrote,

258
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:58,240
 "Caitlyn is a nymphomaniac and the first class bitch."

259
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,560
 (all laughing)

260
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:01,880
 - Is that a medical diagnosis back then?

261
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:06,000
 She does seem a tough character.

262
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,640
 But I really didn't know the thing

263
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,520
 I found most unbelievable about him is

264
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:10,960
 you say that he only wrote six poems

265
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,320
 or whatever in his last seven years.

266
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,640
 Really, he wrote all of his best poetry pretty much.

267
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,960
 Everyone agrees by the time he was 19.

268
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,160
 Isn't that insane?

269
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,600
 I was a child when I was 19.

270
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,440
 I was like, "You're thinking such immature stuff."

271
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,280
 And that's why it's kind of nonsense.

272
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:25,440
 I used to love him when I was a teenager

273
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:28,240
 because I thought, "Well, this must mean something amazing."

274
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,680
 But it was really heartening to read

275
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,800
 all of these reviewers write about him and say,

276
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:32,760
 "The words are beautiful,

277
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:34,840
 "which is what's so fun about reading him,

278
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,480
 "but no one knows what he's on about."

279
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,080
 - He also, 'cause we were calling him a poet,

280
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:40,600
 but he also wrote some pretty seminal other pieces.

281
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:43,440
 Like he wrote "Under Milkwood," which was a play

282
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,760
 which is still sort of known today.

283
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:46,880
 - I did it at school.

284
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:47,720
 - Did you really?

285
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:48,560
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

286
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:49,560
 - I think people do, don't they, ladies?

287
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:50,800
 - Who did you play?

288
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,920
 - Sorry, no, for my GCSE English, I had to learn it.

289
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:56,260
 - Okay, right, yeah, nice.

290
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:59,160
 - You played a tree, admit it, you were one of the trees.

291
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:01,960
 - But there's a lot of milk under me.

292
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:07,000
 - You guys know AJP Taylor?

293
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,040
 - I only know the name as well.

294
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:10,400
 He was a really famous 20th century historian,

295
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:13,440
 like mega famous at a time when historians were rock stars.

296
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:19,440
 Anyway, Dylan Thomas befriended his wife, Margaret,

297
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:22,080
 and--

298
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,240
 - Euphemism?

299
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:26,800
 - Well, she definitely had the hots for him.

300
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:29,120
 And Dylan Thomas went to stay on the sofa

301
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:32,120
 and did a lot of, like he would stay for a month.

302
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:34,840
 And AJP Taylor liked to keep a barrel of beer in the house.

303
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:36,680
 That was just his nice thing.

304
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:38,920
 But he hated having Dylan Thomas to stay

305
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:41,480
 'cause he would drink supposedly 15 pints a day

306
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:44,000
 and he'd constantly have to be replacing his barrel.

307
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,200
 And Taylor's wife, Margaret,

308
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:48,160
 fell absolutely besotted with Dylan Thomas.

309
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,600
 She spent all her money on him.

310
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,320
 She wrote him erotic letters.

311
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:53,800
 She persuaded AJP Taylor to buy a house

312
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:56,800
 for 2,000 pounds for Dylan Thomas.

313
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:59,200
 And Taylor said, "Okay, fine, if you stop giving him money,"

314
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,640
 which she did not.

315
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:02,480
 And then she bought him another house.

316
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,000
 - Jesus Christ.

317
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,320
 - He does sound like a really annoying guy to have to stay.

318
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,960
 - I read one anecdote about him.

319
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:10,920
 He went out drinking with novelist Philip Lindsay

320
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:13,040
 and got his penis stuck in a honeypot.

321
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,760
 (all laughing)

322
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,080
 - We need the poo take.

323
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:19,320
 (all laughing)

324
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:22,280
 - Great thing about this is in Andrew Lycet's biography

325
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:24,680
 and it's kind of mostly there and not really anywhere else.

326
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:27,320
 But it was from people who were there who said it happened.

327
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:29,160
 But no one knows why he did that.

328
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:30,000
 - No.

329
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:30,840
 - Was it a honey trap?

330
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:33,160
 (all laughing)

331
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:34,560
 - They said on the same occasion,

332
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:37,600
 he pushed a shirt button up his nose and couldn't get it out.

333
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,440
 (all laughing)

334
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,240
 You go into the A and E and you're like,

335
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:43,280
 "Yeah, is this button thing?

336
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:45,120
 "Can you get the button thing out, please?"

337
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,720
 "Sir, there appears to be something."

338
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:47,880
 "No, no, just the button."

339
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:48,800
 (all laughing)

340
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,520
 - I actually haven't just said, "Winnie the Pooh,"

341
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:52,880
 I only know Winnie the Pooh-sized honeypots.

342
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,000
 Do they come smaller?

343
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,600
 - Wait, does Winnie the Pooh have massive honeypots?

344
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,720
 - Yeah, his head gets stuck in them.

345
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:57,560
 - Oh, yeah.

346
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:59,840
 Maybe Dylan Thomas was very well endowed

347
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,120
 and that's what kept the women falling in.

348
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,640
 - But the shape of a honeypot is,

349
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:05,720
 it expands as it gets towards the base, as it were.

350
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:07,080
 It's not like a honey jar.

351
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:09,600
 I could understand him getting his penis stuck in a honey jar.

352
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,120
 - I was imagining a honey jar.

353
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,760
 - It's a set honey or runny honey.

354
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:14,560
 - You know, when you go to a travel lodge

355
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,960
 and you get those tiny little jars of honey.

356
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:19,720
 (all laughing)

357
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:20,560
 - We're gonna have to ask you

358
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:21,760
 to leave the breakfast buffet.

359
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:24,160
 (all laughing)

360
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:27,080
 - Everyone's got their own sized honeypot.

361
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:29,320
 Yeah, it's full of tantalising details about biography.

362
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:31,080
 It's amazing, 'cause he's spoken to everyone

363
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:34,080
 who ever knew him, but people just give memories

364
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,440
 without elaboration.

365
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,400
 So there's those two, there's, on one occasion,

366
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,160
 he managed to stab himself in the eye

367
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:41,520
 while eating a plate of meatballs.

368
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:43,440
 No, no further details.

369
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,280
 How do you do that?

370
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:45,120
 - How do you do that?

371
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:48,000
 - And then someone else said there was a particular period

372
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,280
 where he had to deal with his rubber fetishism.

373
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:51,120
 No more on it.

374
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,120
 - That's it, that's it, that's all we get.

375
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,320
 - What did he do with rubber?

376
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,680
 - Now, he's a very important poet.

377
00:13:56,680 --> 00:14:00,240
 He is part of the poet's corner in Westminster Abbey,

378
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,960
 which is reserved for some of the greats,

379
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,440
 it's Shakespeare and so on.

380
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,800
 He originally wasn't in there.

381
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,400
 And it all comes down to Jimmy Carter,

382
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:10,080
 President Jimmy Carter, who lobbied for him to be in there.

383
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:10,920
 - Why?

384
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:12,760
 - He loves him to the point where he went

385
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:15,080
 to certain bits of Wales just to be around the area

386
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:17,440
 that Dylan Thomas would have been in.

387
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:20,400
 Even wrote a poem called A President Expresses Concern

388
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:23,120
 on a visit to Westminster Abbey by Jimmy Carter.

389
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:23,960
 - No way.

390
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,280
 - Gosh.

391
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:27,160
 - That makes me like Dylan Thomas again,

392
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:28,320
 having just gone off him.

393
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,480
 Jimmy Carter liked him.

394
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:31,200
 - Yeah, 'cause you're a massive Carter fan, yeah.

395
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,040
 - Yeah.

396
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:33,400
 What a weird presidential, like,

397
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:35,120
 is that what happens on state visits?

398
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,720
 - He campaigned a bit harder to get himself re-elected.

399
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:38,560
 - Exactly.

400
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:39,640
 - Well, it happened in '82,

401
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:41,320
 so maybe he worked on it post-presidency,

402
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:43,320
 but it was on that trip that he said, "Well, it was old."

403
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:45,200
 - I can imagine Donald Trump at the moment

404
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:47,400
 is trying to get Barney the big purple dinosaur

405
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:48,480
 in Westminster Abbey.

406
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,800
 - We'll do it, we'll do it.

407
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:55,520
 Lawn, this place where he lived,

408
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:58,800
 his local pub was a place called Brown's Hotel.

409
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:02,680
 It was bought recently by, guess who?

410
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:03,520
 - The game.

411
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:04,360
 - The board makers.

412
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:05,600
 - Sorry.

413
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:10,080
 - Okay, give us a clue.

414
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:11,120
 - What, the TV show?

415
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:13,360
 (laughing)

416
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:16,480
 - Why in a two runny skirt?

417
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:19,240
 (laughing)

418
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:22,760
 - No, what was Dylan Thomas?

419
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:24,480
 He was a man behaving badly.

420
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:25,320
 - Yeah.

421
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:26,320
 - Oh, is it Martin Clues?

422
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,640
 - It was Neil Morrissey.

423
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:28,480
 - Oh, really?

424
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,520
 - The other man behaving badly bought his local.

425
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:31,360
 - Really?

426
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,800
 - And Dylan Thomas was a man behaving badly,

427
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,560
 and Neil Morrissey for international business

428
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:37,240
 was about 30 years ago

429
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,800
 in a second club called Mem Haven Badly.

430
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:39,640
 - Yeah.

431
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:40,480
 - That's a great fact.

432
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:41,320
 - That's a great fact.

433
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:43,900
 (upbeat music)

434
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:47,160
 - Okay, it is time for fact number two,

435
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:48,480
 and that is Andy.

436
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:51,720
 - My fact is that six out of 10 lakes are in Canada.

437
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:54,720
 - That's amazing.

438
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,400
 - Out of all the lakes in the world.

439
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:57,240
 - That's wild.

440
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:58,880
 - 60% are in Canada.

441
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:00,120
 - It's big, Canada.

442
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:02,400
 - It is big, but it's not 60% of the world's.

443
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:03,240
 - No.

444
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:04,080
 - It's a lamb ass.

445
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,680
 It's a disproportionate number of lakes.

446
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:08,400
 - So if you wake up after a big old

447
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,520
 Dylan Thomas-style bender,

448
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:13,520
 and you look and there's a lake there,

449
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:15,960
 you're more likely than not in Canada.

450
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:16,800
 - That's right.

451
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:17,640
 - Yeah.

452
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:18,480
 - That's right.

453
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:19,880
 - Do we know how many and why?

454
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:20,800
 - We do.

455
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:25,400
 900,000 and geology is the short.

456
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:26,720
 - No further questions.

457
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,600
 - No, I got this on a great substrate

458
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:30,040
 by a guy called Thomas Pueyo.

459
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:32,440
 And basically, at the bottom, you've got the Great Lakes,

460
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:33,840
 sort of celebrity lakes.

461
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:34,680
 - Yeah.

462
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:36,840
 - And then there's this line stretching across the country,

463
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:39,000
 above which it's just monstrously full of lakes,

464
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,360
 just lakes everywhere, like Thoreau Brick.

465
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:44,520
 And it's because there's a region near the coast,

466
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:47,560
 further up near the coastal mountains, which is lower,

467
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:50,200
 'cause the mountains kind of depressed land around them

468
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:52,400
 with their lamb mass, didn't know mountains did that.

469
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:53,400
 And everywhere else in the world,

470
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:54,920
 or most other places, these depressions,

471
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:57,880
 they turn into river valleys, water flows along, right?

472
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:59,480
 But Canada is very far north,

473
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:02,640
 so it rains less, so there's less water.

474
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:05,080
 And it's also to do with the ice sheets

475
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:07,720
 that dug these huge holes in the ground.

476
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:11,000
 And that leads to lakes when the ice retreats.

477
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:11,840
 Do you know what I mean?

478
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:14,240
 You've got basically lake-shaped masses everywhere.

479
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:18,160
 - Yeah, it was the Laurentide ice sheet, wasn't it?

480
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:21,160
 And that also formed Niagara Falls and the Great Lakes.

481
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:22,400
 So it was a biggie.

482
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:26,280
 And it might also have given us Noah's Ark.

483
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:29,800
 So apparently the collapse of that ice sheet

484
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:33,120
 caused the flooding of the Gibraltar,

485
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:35,240
 Straits of Gibraltar, loads of water going

486
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:38,960
 into the Mediterranean Sea, huge floods everywhere

487
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:41,680
 about 8,000 years ago, and maybe all the myths

488
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:45,400
 that we have about floods in all different cultures

489
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:48,520
 have flood myths, maybe due to that collapse.

490
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:49,360
 Love it.

491
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,560
 - That's amazing.

492
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:51,400
 It's crazy.

493
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:55,000
 So 900,000 lakes in Canada, you're saying Andy.

494
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:59,200
 Manitoba is an area that has 100,000 of those lakes.

495
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:03,400
 And only 10,000 of those lakes have been named.

496
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:06,240
 As of 2017, the number will have gone up,

497
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,440
 but they're trying to give names

498
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,960
 to every single lake that's out there.

499
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:09,800
 - Can we campaign?

500
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:12,800
 - Well, here's the thing to what have a lake named after us.

501
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:13,640
 Doesn't work like that.

502
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:14,600
 - Fish Lake.

503
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:21,280
 - Well, this is a problem that there's not a big group

504
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:22,160
 that names the lakes.

505
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:24,400
 There's one main guy and then he's got a few assistants.

506
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,240
 - What?

507
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:26,080
 - Yeah.

508
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:26,920
 - Well, that's why they haven't gone around

509
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:27,760
 to name them all yet.

510
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:28,600
 - It's been very slow.

511
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:31,600
 He'll name like seven a year, but that's gone up now

512
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:32,440
 with the assistants.

513
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:34,440
 - Maybe as slow as Dylan Thomas writing poetry.

514
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:37,080
 Is this guy just going around doing rock star shows

515
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:38,680
 and saying, "I named lakes"?

516
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:39,520
 - Exactly.

517
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:40,880
 The thing he says is he gets a lot of calls

518
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,920
 on Valentine's Day with people saying,

519
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:45,080
 "Can I in a romantic gesture name this lake

520
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:47,840
 "after my partner or girlfriend or boyfriend or whatever?"

521
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:49,640
 And he says, "No, it doesn't work like that."

522
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:52,280
 - Is he stressed that all these lakes don't have names

523
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:53,120
 or is he relaxed about it?

524
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,520
 - He's relaxed, he's taken his time.

525
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:56,080
 What they're doing is basically naming it

526
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:59,160
 after fallen soldiers from World War II and World War I.

527
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:00,520
 And it's important work

528
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:03,080
 because if you happen to have an accident at a lake,

529
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:04,880
 how do you find it if there's no name?

530
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:05,880
 - Dan, if it's important work,

531
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,720
 maybe he should be trying to name more than seven

532
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:08,560
 every year.

533
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:10,720
 - He has, there was one year where they named 2,000.

534
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:13,120
 Like it's with it because he got assistants in,

535
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:13,960
 assistants came in.

536
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:15,000
 - Pegas can't be choosers.

537
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,120
 I think if I say, "Can you name your lake Polina?"

538
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:20,200
 He shouldn't be saying, "No, I have to do it

539
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,000
 "after this other thing instead."

540
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,760
 - I think he should be accepting these names

541
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,480
 because he needs 20,000 of them.

542
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:26,880
 - He needs a lot of, he needs a lot.

543
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:29,240
 And in fact, there's only been one exception so far.

544
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:32,440
 One living person, when an Olympic gold medalist

545
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:34,840
 in hockey was given a lake name,

546
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:37,280
 he sort of got put ahead of all the fallen soldiers.

547
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,680
 - They'll do anything for hockey players,

548
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:40,400
 the Canadians, right Ney?

549
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,800
 I think he needs to be sacked.

550
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:42,640
 Sorry.

551
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:46,680
 - Do you know what the most common lake name

552
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:48,760
 in the United States of America is?

553
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:51,680
 - Oh, is it, is it guessable?

554
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:52,520
 - Maybe.

555
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:55,000
 - Is it Big Lake or Deep Lake?

556
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,280
 - No, but you're getting there.

557
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:57,920
 It's very descriptive.

558
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:59,760
 - Round Lake.

559
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:00,600
 - Round Lake.

560
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:01,440
 - Wet Lake.

561
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,880
 - That's the closest.

562
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:05,240
 It's Mud Lake.

563
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:06,080
 - Really?

564
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:09,560
 - Yeah, there are 900 Mud Lakes in America,

565
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:11,640
 but they're endangered really,

566
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:13,520
 'cause they're all getting renamed.

567
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:17,080
 So Michigan, for instance, had 300 Mud Lakes,

568
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:20,200
 but 71 of them have been changed in the last few years.

569
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,520
 - Why are they changing them?

570
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:22,520
 Is it not politically correct?

571
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:24,560
 - Well, one reason that you want to,

572
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:26,200
 like Mud Lake isn't very nice,

573
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:28,160
 but number two, like Dan said,

574
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:30,240
 you need to be able to tell exactly where something is.

575
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:33,440
 So if you've got 700 Mud Lakes,

576
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,600
 and you say I've injured myself next to Mud Lake,

577
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,000
 what are they going to do?

578
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
 - Yeah, you're right.

579
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,840
 There are reports, and again,

580
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,920
 this is at the level of Dylan Thomas

581
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:43,560
 was buried in a banana shape.

582
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:44,400
 - Oh God.

583
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,240
 - It's great.

584
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:48,040
 Well, there's a lake in Canada called Lake Minnewenka,

585
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:49,800
 but that is true.

586
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:52,560
 Some reports say it's the smallest lake in Canada,

587
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:53,520
 and it appears not to be.

588
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,320
 I think there are some smaller,

589
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:56,840
 but it is home to a drowned village,

590
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:58,720
 which is called Minnewenka Landing.

591
00:20:58,720 --> 00:20:59,560
 - Cool.

592
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:00,400
 (laughing)

593
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,800
 'Cause that was named after someone who drove a mini.

594
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:06,000
 - It was when Tom Cruise lands his plane.

595
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,320
 That's why he radiates into the control tower as a joke.

596
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:09,960
 (laughing)

597
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:13,000
 - All this depends on how you define a lake, right?

598
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:13,840
 - Yeah.

599
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:16,320
 - Because there's a thing called Lagos, L-A-G-O-S,

600
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:18,040
 which is like a research.

601
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:20,160
 It's like the Wikipedia of lakes,

602
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:21,560
 where you go to if you wanna know anything

603
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:23,360
 about lakes in North America,

604
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:26,320
 but they define a lake as something that is one hectare

605
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:28,160
 in area, surface area.

606
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:30,440
 So that's about two football fields.

607
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:33,680
 But if you were to count lakes that are like one hectare,

608
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:34,680
 so half that size,

609
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:36,220
 then the number of lakes in Canada

610
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:37,680
 goes up to 3.5 million.

611
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:38,800
 - Oh my goodness.

612
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:39,880
 - That's getting stupid.

613
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:41,000
 I was supposed to get a puddle.

614
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,680
 - That guy at the naming office is gonna be,

615
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:45,440
 probably still relaxed.

616
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:46,440
 We've got time.

617
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:48,760
 - And the other scientific definition of a lake

618
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:50,760
 is it needs to have an aphotic zone.

619
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:53,520
 So that's an area deep enough where

620
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,560
 plants can't grow, 'cause they don't get enough light.

621
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:56,400
 - Oh really?

622
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,240
 - Okay.

623
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:59,800
 - That's supposed to be the level between a pond and a lake.

624
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:01,680
 - There's, interestingly, on the definition of a lake,

625
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:04,000
 there's also the bigness of lakes.

626
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,560
 So Lake Superior, one of the great lakes,

627
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:08,440
 and the great lakes are all shared

628
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:11,480
 between the US and Canada, except one, Lake Michigan.

629
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:13,520
 Lake Superior is the largest lake on earth,

630
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:17,040
 but only if you don't count the Caspian Sea,

631
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:19,000
 which is about five times bigger.

632
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,880
 And it's really interesting, the Caspian Sea controversy,

633
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:26,880
 because Caspian Sea is technically a lake, I believe,

634
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:29,360
 as in it's not connected to the sea,

635
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:32,000
 but it has higher salinity than almost any other lake.

636
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,760
 So it's a huge political debate

637
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:36,640
 between Azerbaijan, Iran, Kazakhstan, Russia,

638
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:40,520
 Turkmenistan, which all border this lake/sea,

639
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:42,920
 'cause if it's a lake, you split it equally.

640
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:46,040
 So that's why all the great lakes are split equally

641
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:47,480
 between the US and Canada.

642
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:48,560
 And it's usually important,

643
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:50,280
 'cause it's got massive natural resources.

644
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:51,920
 It's got loads of loads of oil deposits in it,

645
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:53,080
 mineral deposits.

646
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:56,920
 And so Iran, which has a very short coast on the Caspian,

647
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:58,600
 is saying, no, it's definitely a lake.

648
00:22:58,600 --> 00:22:59,440
 Definitely a lake,

649
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:01,160
 'cause I want to split it equally with the rest of you.

650
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:03,760
 - Whereas if it's the seashore,

651
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:06,880
 you own a distance away from the seashore.

652
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:08,600
 - Depending on your length of coastline.

653
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:09,680
 Exactly.

654
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:12,400
 So then, you know, Russia's saying, or Kazakhstan,

655
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,240
 which has a huge coastline,

656
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:14,360
 is saying, this is bullshit.

657
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:16,560
 You can't take a fifth of the oil in it.

658
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:17,400
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

659
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:18,240
 - Wow.

660
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,080
 - So which side do you fall on?

661
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:21,480
 - And when would we get a resolution to...

662
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:23,760
 - No, honestly, turn.

663
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,800
 I think they got a few other things to iron out

664
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:26,640
 in that region.

665
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:29,560
 - Yeah, there was a massive meeting in 2018

666
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:31,320
 called the Convention on the Legal Status

667
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:34,120
 of the Caspian Sea, where all the countries met,

668
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:35,120
 and they were there for weeks,

669
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:37,080
 and they concluded it's neither a lake nor a sea.

670
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:37,920
 - Oh, great.

671
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:40,760
 - It's a pond.

672
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:43,240
 Here's a lake.

673
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:45,760
 This is also in the United States of America.

674
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:47,280
 It's called Crater Lake,

675
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:49,960
 and the Kalmath people who live around it

676
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:53,240
 haven't looked at it for more than 7,000 years.

677
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:54,560
 - No.

678
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:56,600
 How close do they live?

679
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:57,440
 - They don't know.

680
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,080
 (all laughing)

681
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:00,920
 - Do they fall in?

682
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:02,680
 - No, they don't fall in.

683
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:05,480
 So it's basically, it's a taboo.

684
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:06,320
 - Wow.

685
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:09,160
 - And it's, we think down to an eruption

686
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:12,040
 that happened 7,700 years ago,

687
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:14,200
 and then they preserved these stories

688
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:16,260
 of this myth that's happened,

689
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:20,520
 and that would be 300 generations of word of mouth

690
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:21,960
 have kept this story going.

691
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:22,800
 - Don't look at the lake.

692
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:24,040
 - And they still don't look at the lake, yeah.

693
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:25,920
 - What if you accidentally look at the lake?

694
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:27,720
 - Another eruption, probably.

695
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:29,720
 - Someone must have.

696
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:30,640
 - No one's done it.

697
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:31,480
 We don't know.

698
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:33,160
 (all laughing)

699
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:34,000
 - Well, we'd know.

700
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:34,840
 We would know.

701
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:35,680
 - We would know, yeah?

702
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:36,520
 - Wow.

703
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:37,960
 - That's crazy.

704
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:40,520
 - Some lakes swing from side to side.

705
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:42,000
 - Really? - Like a banana.

706
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,880
 - Well, they're called banana lakes.

707
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:45,720
 No, they're not.

708
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:46,560
 - Okay.

709
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:47,400
 - This is amazing though.

710
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:48,640
 They're these things called sashes,

711
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,680
 and the most famous one is in Lake Erie,

712
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:52,320
 which is one of the great lakes.

713
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:54,920
 But basically, it happens if there's a really strong wind

714
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:56,320
 that's going in one direction on a lake,

715
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:58,720
 and it keeps pushing the water up to one end,

716
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:00,880
 and then the wind suddenly stops,

717
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:03,640
 then the water, you can imagine like in a bath,

718
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:06,960
 swings backwards, and it does extraordinary things.

719
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:11,840
 Like in 2008, there were 16 feet high waves in Lake Erie

720
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:14,160
 that flooded, it's Buffalo, I think,

721
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:15,960
 in New York that always gets flooded.

722
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:20,280
 In 1844, there was a 22 foot high Seish wave,

723
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:22,320
 which caused this flood in Buffalo,

724
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,520
 which destroyed the town completely,

725
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:25,760
 just from this swinging lake.

726
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:26,600
 - Crazy.

727
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:30,120
 - 78 people died, it stopped the Niagara Falls from flowing,

728
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:32,600
 'cause it dammed it up, 'cause like the force of all the water

729
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:34,960
 pushed the ice to the top of Niagara Falls,

730
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,080
 and stopped it flowing.

731
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:36,920
 - What?

732
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:38,920
 - Just from this swinging lake, isn't that cool?

733
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:39,920
 - That's very cool.

734
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:41,480
 Not the deaths, but yeah, the other stuff.

735
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:42,440
 - Yeah, it was a long time ago.

736
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:43,280
 - Okay.

737
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:44,120
 - Yeah.

738
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:47,720
 - Canada is so big that the southernmost point of Canada

739
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:49,760
 is closer to Brazil than it is

740
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:51,360
 to the northernmost point of Canada.

741
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:52,960
 - I don't believe you.

742
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,960
 - Well, you've got to.

743
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:55,800
 - Okay.

744
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:56,640
 - Maths.

745
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:57,480
 - How do we resolve this then?

746
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:58,320
 (all laughing)

747
00:25:58,320 --> 00:25:59,520
 - We need a conference.

748
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,680
 (all laughing)

749
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:05,560
 - I mean, yeah, only because I've seen maps.

750
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:09,120
 - I mean, that's, it's about, there's not much in it,

751
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:10,840
 it's about 10 kilometers in it, but it's a lot.

752
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:11,920
 - 10 kilometers in it?

753
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:12,760
 - Yeah.

754
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:13,600
 - That's so close.

755
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:14,960
 - Southernmost point of Canada to northernmost point

756
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:18,440
 of Canada is 4,620 kilometers.

757
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:19,360
 - Right.

758
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:22,400
 - To Brazil, from the southernmost point of Canada,

759
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:24,400
 it's 4,630.

760
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,240
 - Yeah.

761
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:29,440
 - That's like how my house in Margate is closer to Belgium

762
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:31,000
 than it is to London.

763
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:31,840
 - Yeah.

764
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:32,680
 - That's wild.

765
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:33,880
 - And it takes you hours and hours and hours

766
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:34,880
 to get here every day.

767
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,720
 (all laughing)

768
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,160
 - I should stop going via Belgium.

769
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:40,160
 (all laughing)

770
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:42,740
 (upbeat music)

771
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:47,240
 - Okay, it is time for fact number three,

772
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:48,480
 and that is James.

773
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,040
 - Okay, my fact this week is that

774
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:52,280
 at one Spanish football stadium,

775
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:54,520
 they will stop you from eating sunflower seeds,

776
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:57,360
 but they won't stop you from smoking.

777
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:58,880
 - That is so weird.

778
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:00,320
 Is it?

779
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:03,360
 Are you allowed to smoke sunflower seeds, life hack?

780
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:04,680
 - Oh, good thinking.

781
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:05,520
 - Yeah.

782
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:06,360
 - Yeah, roll up.

783
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:07,400
 (all laughing)

784
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:10,360
 - Actually, you're not really supposed to smoke,

785
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:12,520
 but they don't enforce that ban.

786
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:13,360
 - Oh, okay.

787
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:15,680
 - But they are enforcing that ban on sunflower seeds,

788
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:19,600
 and that's because if you go to Spanish football games,

789
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:23,320
 you will often bring sunflower seeds with you as a snack.

790
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:25,000
 They're called pipas,

791
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:28,920
 and this team called Elche has decided to ban them

792
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:30,160
 because people keep,

793
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:32,920
 you kind of, you crack them open and eat the seeds inside,

794
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:34,880
 and then you throw the shells away,

795
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:36,600
 and the shells, they clog the drains,

796
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:38,520
 they clog the pipes,

797
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:41,560
 they rot and deteriorate the seeds,

798
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:44,420
 the pigeons come, rats come,

799
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:47,280
 and they're having to basically redo the entire stadium,

800
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:51,000
 and part of the reason is because these sunflower seeds

801
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,760
 are just all over the place and they're rotting,

802
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:54,160
 and they're making everything ming in.

803
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:55,920
 - Yeah, there's too many for them to clean up,

804
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:57,560
 so as you arrive,

805
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:59,600
 you just crack in shells underneath your foot,

806
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:00,680
 go into your seats.

807
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:02,480
 It's pretty amazing,

808
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,200
 such a tiny thing causing such chaos.

809
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:05,920
 - And this was in the times that I read this,

810
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:07,920
 and one of the fans said this is the best thing

811
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:08,760
 they could have done,

812
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:11,000
 and now they just have to enforce the ban on smoking.

813
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:11,960
 (laughing)

814
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:12,920
 - Yeah, yeah.

815
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:15,200
 Is it Spain-wide that these things are enjoyed?

816
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:17,160
 - It's common throughout Spain, yeah.

817
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:18,000
 - Really interesting,

818
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
 'cause it's quite a hippie-ish, quite healthy thing,

819
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,600
 I imagine, like, oh, I'm just eating some sunflower seeds.

820
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:24,240
 - This is a really salty.

821
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:26,120
 - Oh, okay, they're very snacky.

822
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:27,440
 - This is the thing that I discovered,

823
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:30,280
 it's this whole global culture that we do not have

824
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:33,080
 in Britain of sunflower seeds being such a popular snack,

825
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:34,200
 and they're all these countries,

826
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:35,960
 so Spain is one of them,

827
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:36,800
 where they're really popular,

828
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:37,840
 across Eastern Europe,

829
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:39,120
 Eastern European listeners,

830
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:41,720
 writing, "Confirm how many sunflower seeds you eat a day."

831
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,600
 China, the Middle East, Russia,

832
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:45,840
 they're like this big deal snack,

833
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:48,720
 and so I think in China, you have them in the shells,

834
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,720
 and it's this great meditative experience,

835
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:53,080
 the one girl was saying that you put it in your mouth,

836
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:55,720
 you have to get the sunflower seed out of the shell.

837
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:58,000
 - Yeah, you kind of do it with your teeth on it, yeah.

838
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,640
 - So the little gray thing that I get

839
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:00,800
 when I buy a packet of sunflower seeds

840
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,240
 is not a sunflower seed,

841
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:04,440
 it's actually, that's the kernel.

842
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:05,280
 - Yeah, it's a kernel.

843
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:06,360
 - A de-hulled kernel,

844
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:08,360
 whereas people here are eating the naked seeds,

845
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:10,520
 which are the black and white striped, they're bigger.

846
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:11,880
 - Better inside, yeah.

847
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:13,200
 - That is a sunflower seed.

848
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,920
 - Yeah, and it's pretty amazing.

849
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:17,880
 I went to the National Gallery the other day

850
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:21,680
 to look specifically at Van Gogh's sunflowers, right?

851
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:22,720
 - I was research with this fact.

852
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:24,280
 - No, it's completely separate.

853
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:26,680
 I was just, I thought, "God, it's around the corner,

854
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:27,640
 why have I not been there?"

855
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:29,040
 And I went, stood, and just stared,

856
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:31,280
 and each flower, there's 11 flowers,

857
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:34,040
 they contain about 2000, between one and 2000 seeds.

858
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:37,280
 That would have been edible, you know, what was in the pot.

859
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:38,520
 I find that fascinating.

860
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:40,640
 I've never thought about it in that way before.

861
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:41,480
 - No, me neither.

862
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:42,320
 If you're really hungry

863
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:43,760
 and you've got a sunflower growing in your kitchen,

864
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:46,560
 scrape off the top, if it's reached ripeness,

865
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:47,400
 and get some seeds out.

866
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:49,640
 - There's like a TikTok trend at the moment

867
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:53,600
 where people are like roasting entire sunflower heads

868
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:54,440
 and eating them.

869
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:56,000
 - Ooh. - They're really.

870
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,080
 - I mean, it's just classic TikTok.

871
00:29:58,080 --> 00:29:58,920
 - That doesn't seem so.

872
00:29:58,920 --> 00:29:59,760
 - Everyone's a food expert

873
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:01,440
 until you actually try what you're eating,

874
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:02,320
 and then it's disgusting.

875
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:04,400
 - Well, people do seem to rave about them.

876
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:05,720
 And I was reading in China,

877
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:07,640
 the way they harvest them is really cool.

878
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:09,320
 So people go through with digmachetes

879
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:10,560
 or massive pairs of scissors,

880
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:12,600
 and they chop the heads off all the...

881
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:14,280
 Yeah, or nail scissors, whatever you've got to have.

882
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:16,480
 - Like you're opening a department store.

883
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:18,840
 - Yeah, exactly, a lot of ribbons to cut.

884
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:21,360
 They chop the heads off each individual sunflower,

885
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:23,520
 but then they pick up the heads,

886
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:24,720
 they spin them upside down,

887
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:26,960
 and they plonk them back on top of the stalk,

888
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:29,440
 and they leave them there for another week to dry.

889
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:31,280
 And that's 'cause it saves having to dry them

890
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:32,320
 in a certain space.

891
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:36,360
 So you'll sometimes go to a big sunflower field in China

892
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:38,600
 and be like, "Oh, the flowers are upside down."

893
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:40,200
 - Yeah. - They've all been decapitated.

894
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:41,280
 - They've all been decapitated

895
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:42,760
 and had their heads put on upside down.

896
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:44,040
 - Who did this?

897
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:45,880
 - That's amazing. - What a psycho.

898
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:48,560
 - So I should just say L.J., by the way,

899
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:50,880
 the football team, they're from Alicante.

900
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:53,080
 They were promoted to La Liga last season.

901
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:55,480
 And I read as much as I could about them.

902
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:57,840
 There's not a great deal of interesting stuff,

903
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:01,560
 apart from the Ketman, the head Ketman is called Pepito,

904
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:04,360
 whose name is Spanish for pumpkin seed.

905
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:06,120
 - Lovely, lovely.

906
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:07,560
 - It's not quite right, is it?

907
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:08,840
 - No. - You haven't quite

908
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:10,480
 got that almost all the time. - Almost got it.

909
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:12,440
 I saw his name and I was like,

910
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:14,920
 "That really looks like it means sunflower seed."

911
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:16,240
 - Yeah. - But unfortunately,

912
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:18,040
 no, 'pipas' is the sunflower seed,

913
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:20,080
 which also means blowjobs in Greek.

914
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:21,320
 - Golly. - Oh, cool.

915
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:23,480
 - Well, that wasn't,

916
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:25,800
 surely that one would have led to any confusion.

917
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:30,200
 A load of Spanish football fans turn up at Panofinaikos.

918
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:32,160
 - You've got to crack it open with your teeth.

919
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:34,400
 (laughing)

920
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:39,160
 - They are known these seeds as Spain's football foreplay.

921
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:42,040
 I don't know if you can cross that phrase here.

922
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:43,680
 But what is Britain's football foreplay?

923
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:45,160
 - Pies. - You guys go to football with pies.

924
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:46,920
 - Pies of pies. - Nice pie.

925
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:48,800
 - As in, that's just foreplay in general, isn't it?

926
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:50,880
 A nice steak and kidney pie.

927
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:52,320
 - Scotch pies, they're called.

928
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:53,400
 - What is a Scotch pie?

929
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:55,640
 - Scotch pie is,

930
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:57,800
 probably if you go to football in the South of England,

931
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:58,880
 you don't really get this stuff,

932
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:00,240
 but certainly in the North of England,

933
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:03,800
 they're kind of made of pastry, like water pastry,

934
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:06,720
 and they usually have mutton in them, lots of potato,

935
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:09,200
 not so much meat, absolutely delicious.

936
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:10,440
 - Yeah. - Yum.

937
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:14,480
 - And they were supposedly despised by the Scottish Church,

938
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:17,480
 because they were considered a sumptuous meal

939
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:20,000
 and very similar to English pies.

940
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:23,720
 So the Scottish Church tried to ban Scotch pies for a while,

941
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:24,720
 but they never managed.

942
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:26,160
 - I would say keep your beaks out, guys.

943
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:29,600
 I just think that's not the jurisdiction to...

944
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:31,440
 - Like the Church tends to get involved

945
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:33,480
 in lots of different things, doesn't it?

946
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:35,840
 Historically, especially the Scottish Church.

947
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:37,240
 - I just think that's a bit like Jimmy Carter

948
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:40,960
 getting involved in Dylan Thomas' posthumous reputation.

949
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,520
 I just think, come on, prioritise.

950
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:44,440
 - Not your area. - You've got perks to run.

951
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:47,800
 - Actually, it was because of the Church,

952
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:50,880
 I think that sunflower seeds came to be.

953
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:53,960
 - Well, unless you're saying that God made them.

954
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:55,400
 - Exactly.

955
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:58,800
 Sorry, yeah, that we started eating sunflower seeds,

956
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:01,360
 because, so they were huge in Russia first.

957
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:03,760
 Russia was like 100 years ahead of the rest of us,

958
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:05,760
 mainly in terms of turning them into oil,

959
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:07,160
 which is where it's so valuable.

960
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:10,520
 And it was basically because during any kind of fast,

961
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:13,360
 Christian fasting or Lent or anything like that in Russia,

962
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:15,720
 then any kind of vegetable oils were banned,

963
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:18,400
 and then Peter the Great or his minions have discovered

964
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:20,440
 that you could get oil from sunflower seeds.

965
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:21,880
 - It was Peter the Great when he, you know,

966
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:25,640
 he did his European tour, he saw them in like the Netherlands

967
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:26,800
 or something and brought them back.

968
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:28,040
 - He did, yes.

969
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:31,000
 And then some peasant in Russia in the 19th century,

970
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,400
 just working in the fields peasant,

971
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:35,840
 built a machine to get oil out of them.

972
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:37,960
 And because they were new oil,

973
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:40,400
 the Church hadn't managed to create in its list

974
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:42,240
 the name sunflower oil. - It's so funny.

975
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:44,040
 - And so everyone just drenched their food

976
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:45,600
 with sunflower oil during Lent.

977
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:46,560
 That's why it was so popular.

978
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:50,160
 - And now Ukraine and Russia is by far the biggest producers

979
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:52,560
 of sunflower oil in the world, like by a billion.

980
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:55,880
 - I read that, it's like, more than half the global production

981
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:56,720
 is there. - Yeah.

982
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:58,280
 And that's why Ukraine like the sunflower

983
00:33:58,280 --> 00:33:59,400
 is a symbol of Ukraine.

984
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:01,440
 - I see, I didn't know that.

985
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:03,400
 - It was used as well for mopping up basically

986
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:06,760
 a lot of the radioactive waste during the Chernobyl disaster.

987
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:07,600
 - Was it?

988
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:08,440
 - Yeah, so the stems,

989
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:10,960
 they noticed that when they put them into bodies of water,

990
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:13,480
 that it would take up a lot of the radioactive elements

991
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:14,680
 and then they could bring it away

992
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:16,840
 and then they could discard it in a better way.

993
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:19,320
 But so, sunflowers are planted largely

994
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:22,480
 around nuclear radioactive areas in Chernobyl and use.

995
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:23,480
 - Gosh, sunflowers are useful.

996
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:24,320
 - Yeah, yeah.

997
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:27,720
 - Famous pop culture person who eats sunflower seeds.

998
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:29,360
 - Okay.

999
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:30,200
 - Cardi B.

1000
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:33,760
 - Cardi B.

1001
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:34,600
 - Good shout.

1002
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:35,960
 - Someone that you guys have,

1003
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:37,640
 a character that you guys will be familiar with.

1004
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:38,480
 - Can you give us a clue?

1005
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:40,680
 - Olex Snoopy, a fictional character.

1006
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:42,120
 - Yeah, 1990s.

1007
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:43,960
 - 1990s fictional character.

1008
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:45,480
 - The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air.

1009
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:46,320
 - Very good, no.

1010
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:47,520
 - Dennis the Manus.

1011
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:48,360
 - No.

1012
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:49,400
 - Oh yeah, cartoon or real?

1013
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:50,240
 - Real.

1014
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:52,040
 - Zach from "Saved by the Bell".

1015
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:55,640
 - Okay, Blobby, Blobby, Blobby.

1016
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:56,600
 - British or American?

1017
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:57,440
 - American.

1018
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:58,280
 - Okay.

1019
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:00,040
 - One of the Simpsons.

1020
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:02,360
 - No, but one of the biggest shows of the 1990s.

1021
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:03,200
 - Friends.

1022
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:05,000
 - People are yelling this at home, not friends.

1023
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:08,840
 Something that Dan would like due to his other podcast.

1024
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:11,200
 - A weird equippity thing.

1025
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:14,840
 - Come on guys, the truth is out there.

1026
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:17,880
 - Oh, the ex-Fox Mulder loved Sunflower Seeds.

1027
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:21,160
 - Fox Mulder, he eats Sunflower Seeds all the way through it.

1028
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:23,480
 And he had to stop in the later series

1029
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:24,440
 because according to him,

1030
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:26,440
 it's hard to act with Sunflower Seeds.

1031
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:30,160
 But it was the creator, Chris Carter,

1032
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:32,240
 who would eat Sunflower Seeds.

1033
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:34,720
 And he kind of passed it on to the character.

1034
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:36,960
 But David D'Covny, who played Mulder,

1035
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:38,680
 wants people to know that he doesn't like

1036
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:41,760
 Sunflower Seeds and he also does not wear ties.

1037
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:44,120
 So fans are discouraged from sending him either.

1038
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:48,560
 - Poor guy, so he's forced to eat the Sunflower Seeds

1039
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:49,720
 constantly.

1040
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:51,800
 - And wear lots of ties as well.

1041
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:53,320
 Poor guy.

1042
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:54,640
 - I mentioned Van Gogh earlier.

1043
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:56,480
 There's another very famous art piece

1044
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:57,960
 which is called Sunflower Seeds.

1045
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:59,080
 Do you remember that?

1046
00:35:59,080 --> 00:35:59,920
 - Ai Wei Wei.

1047
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:01,920
 - Ai Wei Wei, 2011.

1048
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:04,000
 So this is extraordinary.

1049
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,840
 He handcrafted Porcelain Sunflower Seeds

1050
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:09,400
 with his team, there was 1,600 people,

1051
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:13,120
 and they made 100 million of them.

1052
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:14,640
 - It feels like he's the guy to solve

1053
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:17,160
 the Canadian Lake naming dilemma.

1054
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:19,280
 Like they can just bang through that.

1055
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:22,800
 - If these 1,600 people, I'm sure, you know,

1056
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:25,000
 it's making a very important political point

1057
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,200
 and stuff like that.

1058
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:30,320
 But it's a long time to be making tiny ceramic seeds.

1059
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:32,560
 - Oh, I see, I think it's a bit of a waste of time.

1060
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:34,440
 - I mean, being a podcaster is a waste of time.

1061
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:38,360
 I'm fully accept that, but I just think...

1062
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:42,360
 - We've made 100 million identical episodes of this show.

1063
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:44,120
 But it has been useful, I would say.

1064
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:44,960
 Yes, what's the point?

1065
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:46,000
 - They weren't identical, were they?

1066
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,720
 They were slightly, I remember this.

1067
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:48,960
 - Oh, 'cause they handcrafted.

1068
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:50,440
 - I was talking about the episodes of the show,

1069
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:53,880
 which is why I remember the slight differences.

1070
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:56,080
 - Well, they put, and so they were first displayed

1071
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:58,120
 at the Turbine Hall at the Tate.

1072
00:36:58,120 --> 00:37:00,640
 And if you've ever been there, you know what that's like.

1073
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:03,080
 - Yeah, you get these huge exhibits

1074
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:04,240
 that are really famous every year.

1075
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:05,080
 I went to that one, actually.

1076
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:05,920
 - Did you?

1077
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:07,000
 Did you get to walk on the seeds?

1078
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:07,840
 - No, I didn't.

1079
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:09,080
 - 'Cause I got to walk around on them.

1080
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:12,400
 - So to begin with, and it raised up about 10 centimetres

1081
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:14,720
 off the ground, that's how many seeds are where the height

1082
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:15,560
 that it reached to.

1083
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:16,400
 - Only 10 centimetres?

1084
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:17,640
 - Well, it's a big, it's huge hole.

1085
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:18,640
 - Yeah, it's a massive hole.

1086
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:19,480
 - Not very much.

1087
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:20,920
 - Put it in a smaller room, have 'em up to your neck.

1088
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:21,920
 That's what I would have done.

1089
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:22,760
 - Good idea.

1090
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:24,000
 - Like, that's exciting.

1091
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,040
 - No, that's hard.

1092
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:28,400
 So was the point he's making is that we're all different?

1093
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:30,320
 - No, the point he was making, I believe.

1094
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:32,720
 Well, there's lots of different points like much art,

1095
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:33,560
 but I think a lot of it.

1096
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:35,400
 And this is why the trampling was so important.

1097
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:37,000
 And I remember being so disappointed

1098
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,560
 is about the oppression and repression of the Chinese state

1099
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:41,200
 and all these people, these, you know,

1100
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:43,120
 billions of people in China being treated

1101
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:46,240
 just like one random identical sunflower to another.

1102
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:47,080
 Don't have your own.

1103
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:49,440
 - And I think Chairman Mao used to say

1104
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:52,680
 that the people of China were sunflower seeds.

1105
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:54,840
 And his idea is like, if you get all

1106
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:57,320
 of these hundred million seeds together,

1107
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:59,920
 then they make something very big and important.

1108
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:02,560
 But by themselves, they're kind of...

1109
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:04,600
 - Oh yeah, that's a different interpretation.

1110
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:05,440
 There you go.

1111
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:06,280
 - I don't know.

1112
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:08,680
 Like you, I went and was slightly disappointed

1113
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:10,120
 that I wasn't allowed to walk on them.

1114
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:11,680
 - And you weren't allowed, to begin with,

1115
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:13,880
 you were allowed to walk on them and then health and safety

1116
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:15,200
 because they thought little micro dust

1117
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:16,920
 was coming through from all the crunching.

1118
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:19,880
 But it worked out that the equivalent sunflower seeds

1119
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:25,000
 that he made, that Van Gogh would have to paint,

1120
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,160
 would be 50,000 flowers.

1121
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:28,000
 - Okay.

1122
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,880
 - Because it's about 2,000 seeds per herd, right?

1123
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:30,720
 - About 2,000.

1124
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:31,560
 I think that math, right?

1125
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:34,400
 I was 18 whiskies deep by the time I did that, but yeah.

1126
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:35,240
 - That's doable.

1127
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:38,400
 - Baseball players also love sunflower seeds, apparently,

1128
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:39,520
 in the USA.

1129
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:41,920
 There is this question of why baseball players

1130
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:43,840
 are constantly chewing.

1131
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:44,680
 'Cause they are.

1132
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:46,560
 If you look at them in the dugout, they're always eating.

1133
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:49,200
 So there's one big theory is that the game is boring.

1134
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:52,680
 - My daughter, when she gets bored,

1135
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:54,360
 she always asks, can I have a snack?

1136
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:56,600
 - Right, the theory is that's what they're doing.

1137
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:57,600
 You know, they're sporting guys.

1138
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:59,320
 They will burn it off, but basically,

1139
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:01,520
 it's a dull game to watch and to participate in.

1140
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:03,080
 - I really like lots of sports,

1141
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:06,200
 but I do find it difficult to sit in a stadium

1142
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:07,880
 through an entire baseball game.

1143
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:09,000
 - Right, there we go.

1144
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,640
 - I think there really is a divide in the world,

1145
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:11,920
 which no other sport has,

1146
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:14,280
 between people who understand why baseball's appealing

1147
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:16,760
 and are obsessed with it, and friends obsessed,

1148
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:18,200
 and the rest of us who think,

1149
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:21,160
 "Well, but it sounds like all the players are on our side."

1150
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:22,000
 - Well, they...

1151
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:26,120
 They know from the inside.

1152
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:27,680
 But they used to chew tobacco.

1153
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:30,040
 That's another theory why people,

1154
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:31,240
 they might choose sunflower seeds now,

1155
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:32,760
 'cause you don't chew tobacco anymore.

1156
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:35,720
 - But chewing tobacco could give them some buzz.

1157
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:37,320
 - And they had another big advantage.

1158
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:39,040
 When baseball players chew tobacco,

1159
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:41,680
 they could slobber their juice onto the ball.

1160
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:42,520
 (laughing)

1161
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:43,360
 - Interesting.

1162
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:45,760
 - And Phil and Thomas used to slather his juice

1163
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:46,920
 onto the surface of the...

1164
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:48,760
 (laughing)

1165
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:51,680
 - If you slobbered on the ball, it would become darker,

1166
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:54,240
 and that would be harder for the batter to see.

1167
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:57,080
 So it's a tricky, sneaky way

1168
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:58,880
 of making a camouflage ball.

1169
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:01,400
 - I understand this against the rules to do that.

1170
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:05,200
 - The rule was changed in 1920 to disallow ball defacing.

1171
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:06,640
 That was what it was defined as.

1172
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:08,240
 So maybe that's another reason

1173
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:09,280
 for the rise of the sunflower seed,

1174
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:12,200
 apart from the unbearable tedium of watching this game.

1175
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:13,600
 (laughing)

1176
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:16,840
 - Okay, speaking of tedious American sports,

1177
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:19,040
 I mean, I absolutely love American football,

1178
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:23,160
 but what snacks do you associate with American football?

1179
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:24,640
 - Weeners, get your weeners.

1180
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:26,480
 - Hot dogs, oh, that's the same as a weener, isn't it?

1181
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:27,840
 - So hot dogs, for me,

1182
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:31,240
 I would more have hot dogs at a baseball game, probably.

1183
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:33,840
 - Candy gloss.

1184
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:34,840
 - Nutshells.

1185
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:36,040
 - Yeah, all these are good answers.

1186
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:36,880
 - Caviar.

1187
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:38,200
 - Caviar is correct.

1188
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:40,880
 From the Caspian Sea, the belugas.

1189
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:43,600
 No, it's, I think for me, it's chicken wings.

1190
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:44,440
 - Okay.

1191
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:45,880
 - If you're watching the Super Bowl,

1192
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:48,920
 everyone in America basically eats chicken wings.

1193
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:52,520
 And this all came due to an accidental

1194
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:56,000
 over-order by a company in Buffalo.

1195
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,800
 They accidentally ordered a load of chicken wings

1196
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:01,120
 and they didn't know what to do with them.

1197
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:03,920
 And so they came up with a new recipe,

1198
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:06,040
 which was Buffalo wings.

1199
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:08,440
 So you basically put chili sauce and butter together

1200
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:10,920
 and it makes this sauce and they're absolutely delicious.

1201
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:14,240
 And this bar called Anchor Bay, they started making them.

1202
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:15,720
 And then a little bit later,

1203
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:19,240
 the Buffalo Bill's NFL team made it to the Super Bowl

1204
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:20,760
 for three years in a row.

1205
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:23,120
 And everyone associated the Buffalo Bill's team

1206
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:24,600
 with Buffalo wings.

1207
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:28,120
 And suddenly chicken wings became like the food

1208
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:30,000
 for the Super Bowl.

1209
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,160
 - So it's all a big mistake.

1210
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:33,360
 - It's a whole different thing.

1211
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:36,240
 But 1.6 billion chicken wings are eaten

1212
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:38,040
 on Super Bowl Sunday every year.

1213
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:38,880
 - Jesus.

1214
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:41,560
 I think, 'cause Americans get some shit sometimes

1215
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:42,600
 from the rest of the world

1216
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:44,480
 about certain elements of their culture.

1217
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:46,080
 But one of the greatest cultural things

1218
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:47,080
 that exists in America,

1219
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:48,760
 which I didn't really know that it was a thing,

1220
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:50,160
 is tailgating.

1221
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:51,000
 - Tailgating.

1222
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,160
 - Or the tailgate.

1223
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:54,160
 - Driving very close to the person in front of you.

1224
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:55,840
 - Well, indeed. - That's the only thing I know.

1225
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:57,560
 - That's all we know it as.

1226
00:41:57,560 --> 00:42:01,520
 But like basically at any NFL match in the parking lot,

1227
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:04,560
 then you'll have a tailgate party and there's hosts.

1228
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:07,080
 And I was asking when my husband's lived in America

1229
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:09,640
 and he was like, yeah, I mean, literally everyone does it.

1230
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:11,080
 Every NFL match.

1231
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:13,520
 - I've been to a couple of NFL matches in America

1232
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:15,080
 and I never got invited to this party.

1233
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:17,400
 - I'm so sorry. - Wow, interesting.

1234
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:18,800
 - So wait, sorry, you go to the car park.

1235
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:19,640
 - Yep.

1236
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:23,040
 And there are just people who are such big fans of the team

1237
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:25,720
 that they cook up a massive feast.

1238
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:28,120
 They've made like a hundred burgers and pizzas for everyone

1239
00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:30,640
 and loads of beers and just everyone has it.

1240
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:33,200
 They have a big party, but kind of anyone's invited.

1241
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:34,820
 So you go and it's called tailgating.

1242
00:42:34,820 --> 00:42:37,460
 - Well, almost anyone's, don't rub it in, am I not?

1243
00:42:37,460 --> 00:42:39,520
 (all laughing)

1244
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:41,680
 - I was starving that day.

1245
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:43,480
 - Driving around a completely empty town,

1246
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:44,320
 weren't you James?

1247
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:45,160
 - I was over a body.

1248
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:46,800
 - All the restaurants were closed.

1249
00:42:46,820 --> 00:42:49,400
 (all laughing)

1250
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:57,480
 - Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show

1251
00:42:57,480 --> 00:42:59,040
 and that is Anna.

1252
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:01,840
 - My fact this week is that Singaporeans drink

1253
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:05,360
 more than a bottle of Scotch per person per month,

1254
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:08,480
 which is twice as much as their nearest rivals.

1255
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:09,320
 - Wow. - Wow.

1256
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:10,160
 - What?

1257
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:12,560
 - I say the children of Dylan Thomas.

1258
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:14,000
 - I like the way you say rivals,

1259
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,800
 like there's a big sort of international competition

1260
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:18,960
 for who can drink the most Scotch.

1261
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:20,600
 - Per-old Latvia coming second,

1262
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:21,920
 desperately trying to catch up.

1263
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:22,760
 - Are they second Latvia?

1264
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:23,720
 - Latvia a second. - Really?

1265
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:24,560
 - Yeah.

1266
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:26,360
 - A bottle of Scotch per person per month.

1267
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:27,480
 - Isn't that insane?

1268
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:28,440
 - That is a lot.

1269
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:31,680
 - Latvia has their own, what is it now?

1270
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:32,960
 I have some at home.

1271
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:35,680
 It's like schnapps-y stuff that Latvians drink.

1272
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:37,480
 So, and they have balsam as well.

1273
00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:38,320
 - Balsam, yeah.

1274
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:40,680
 - So like, they're spreading themselves too thin,

1275
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:42,040
 the Latvians, I didn't say that.

1276
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:42,880
 - You're right.

1277
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:43,720
 - I could call.

1278
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:45,480
 - Give up the balsam and having tasted the balsam,

1279
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:46,320
 just give up the balsam.

1280
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:48,160
 - Yeah, and then you'll win.

1281
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:49,280
 - Stick with the whiskey.

1282
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:52,080
 - So a bottle per person per month.

1283
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:54,240
 - Or they buy a bottle of Scotch per person per month.

1284
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:55,880
 And I think that's an important distinction

1285
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:58,120
 'cause I struggled to really find the reason.

1286
00:43:58,120 --> 00:44:00,480
 - 'Cause I, like, I've got a bottle of whiskey at home

1287
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:02,280
 and I've been working on it pretty solidly

1288
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:03,120
 for a couple of years now.

1289
00:44:03,120 --> 00:44:05,960
 And I mean, like, I've got past the halfway mark.

1290
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:08,680
 But is all this whiskey being drunk

1291
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:10,920
 or is it that it's just being bought and stored?

1292
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:12,000
 - Well, it's not clear.

1293
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,960
 So the stats are from the Scotch Whiskey Association.

1294
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:18,760
 So, which says that they export 12.76 bottles a year.

1295
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:20,640
 They have all the export figures.

1296
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:22,840
 In case you're wondering, domestically,

1297
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:23,680
 in case you're wondering,

1298
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:26,200
 "Oh, the Scottish surely drink more."

1299
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:29,680
 73 million bottles are sold domestically in the UK each year.

1300
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:32,480
 So even if every single UK bottle of whiskey

1301
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:34,240
 was sold in Scotland,

1302
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:36,600
 they'd only just be drinking as much whiskey

1303
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:38,480
 as the Singaporeans.

1304
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:40,840
 - And we know that Andy's having, you know?

1305
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:42,680
 - Andy's getting through.

1306
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:45,120
 - Working away on my famous grass, yeah.

1307
00:44:45,120 --> 00:44:46,960
 - I've still got a bottle of whiskey in my house

1308
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:49,320
 that I bought on my honeymoon, which was 12 years ago.

1309
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:50,160
 - Really?

1310
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:51,000
 - Thank you.

1311
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:52,240
 - Is that for aging purposes?

1312
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:53,080
 - No, we only,

1313
00:44:53,080 --> 00:44:56,480
 I only use it for whiskey sauce on Burns Night once a year.

1314
00:44:56,480 --> 00:45:00,000
 - Is it, it's not unbelievably delicious whiskey,

1315
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,120
 is it that you're wasting on it?

1316
00:45:01,120 --> 00:45:02,160
 - It's telescope, it's pretty good.

1317
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:03,000
 - Oh, really?

1318
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,320
 - Yeah.

1319
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:05,480
 - Okay, well, we're not contributing

1320
00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:07,400
 to the English stats, obviously.

1321
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:08,680
 But it's weird.

1322
00:45:08,680 --> 00:45:09,520
 I was looking it up.

1323
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:11,200
 Singaporeans very light drinkers.

1324
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:14,760
 They consume two litres of alcohol per person per year,

1325
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:19,400
 which is about five times less than we do as Brits.

1326
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:20,840
 And it seems to be,

1327
00:45:20,840 --> 00:45:22,560
 when I was looking at like people talking about it,

1328
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:24,760
 Singaporeans talking about it, it is about investment.

1329
00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:27,000
 And a lot of them are buying up whiskey now.

1330
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:28,360
 It's become a trendy thing.

1331
00:45:28,360 --> 00:45:29,800
 It's a pretty wealthy country.

1332
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:31,600
 - Well, there's a lot of expats as well, so.

1333
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:33,560
 - Lots of expats, yeah, that's true.

1334
00:45:33,560 --> 00:45:35,760
 - Who will skew the number of people and what they drink.

1335
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:37,560
 - If I go as a tourist to Singapore,

1336
00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:38,920
 'cause I know it's a whiskey hub,

1337
00:45:38,920 --> 00:45:40,600
 'cause then they've got lots of amazing whiskey

1338
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:42,120
 from around the world and whiskey shops and things,

1339
00:45:42,120 --> 00:45:43,280
 and I buy a bottle there.

1340
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:44,480
 Does that count, do you think?

1341
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:46,360
 - A Judy Free Sitch, yeah.

1342
00:45:46,360 --> 00:45:47,720
 - I've never been except, I think,

1343
00:45:47,720 --> 00:45:49,440
 briefly to the airport once.

1344
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:50,960
 But it sounds like an amazing--

1345
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:52,600
 - The airport is nice, in fairness.

1346
00:45:52,600 --> 00:45:54,320
 - And again, I didn't go specifically to--

1347
00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:56,040
 (all laughing)

1348
00:45:56,040 --> 00:45:57,160
 - I just went into Changi,

1349
00:45:57,160 --> 00:46:00,320
 couple of glasses of whiskey, straight back out.

1350
00:46:00,320 --> 00:46:02,040
 I'm half a glass of whiskey today.

1351
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:03,280
 I think that's a record.

1352
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:05,860
 (all laughing)

1353
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:09,080
 - But it's an amazingly weird place.

1354
00:46:09,080 --> 00:46:10,200
 - It's cool, I've been.

1355
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:12,360
 - Yeah, yeah, I went a lot as a kid.

1356
00:46:12,360 --> 00:46:14,200
 - I suppose it's not far from there.

1357
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:16,280
 So it's right at the bottom of Malaysia,

1358
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:18,480
 and it's much like Portsmouth in that it's an island,

1359
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:20,640
 but it's separated by a very narrow strip of water

1360
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:22,840
 from the rest of the mainland, as it were.

1361
00:46:22,840 --> 00:46:23,840
 - Portsmouth, the south.

1362
00:46:23,840 --> 00:46:25,920
 - It's the Portsmouth of the south.

1363
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:26,880
 - When you learn in Singapore,

1364
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:29,920
 there's a big banner that says much like Portsmouth, welcome.

1365
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:33,960
 - Here's another thing they drink there, Yakult.

1366
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:34,800
 - Oh yeah?

1367
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:38,680
 - So you know Yakult, that kind of little sort of yogurty drink

1368
00:46:38,680 --> 00:46:40,640
 with probiotics in it.

1369
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:42,640
 Singapore is the only country in the world

1370
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:44,960
 that sells different flavors of Yakult.

1371
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:46,280
 - Is it?

1372
00:46:46,280 --> 00:46:49,800
 - Interesting, so just a childhood thing,

1373
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:52,240
 Yakult was massive in my childhood in Hong Kong,

1374
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:55,280
 but I can't picture another flavor other than the basic.

1375
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:57,360
 - Well, honestly, they only do it in Singapore.

1376
00:46:57,360 --> 00:46:59,640
 They also have the biggest serving size

1377
00:46:59,640 --> 00:47:01,920
 of anywhere in the world, which is 100 milliliters.

1378
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:03,640
 Now you can get that one in Hong Kong as well.

1379
00:47:03,640 --> 00:47:05,000
 You can get that in a few countries,

1380
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:06,160
 but you can't get it in the UK,

1381
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:07,520
 but you can get it in Singapore.

1382
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:09,160
 - You mean of spirits?

1383
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:10,000
 - No, sorry, of Yakult.

1384
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:10,840
 - Yakult.

1385
00:47:10,840 --> 00:47:11,960
 - Yakult was the only Yakult.

1386
00:47:11,960 --> 00:47:13,280
 - It's like a novelty Toblerone, right?

1387
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:14,120
 Like it's a--

1388
00:47:14,120 --> 00:47:16,800
 - Yeah, and also in Singapore,

1389
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:18,000
 this is the only place they have it.

1390
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,960
 They have a Yakult home delivery service,

1391
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:23,480
 which started in 1986,

1392
00:47:23,480 --> 00:47:26,120
 and they will bring you your Yakult to your door

1393
00:47:26,120 --> 00:47:26,960
 if you want it.

1394
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:28,160
 - Jesus Christ.

1395
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:29,920
 Their gut health must be out of this world.

1396
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:32,480
 (all laughing)

1397
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:33,320
 - That's amazing.

1398
00:47:33,320 --> 00:47:34,840
 - Isn't that weird?

1399
00:47:34,840 --> 00:47:35,880
 - 'Cause it's an island.

1400
00:47:35,880 --> 00:47:37,440
 It's got this kind of island culture,

1401
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:39,040
 you know, where just things are popular there

1402
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:39,960
 that aren't popular anywhere else.

1403
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:43,560
 Like they've got the world's first ever salmon ATM there.

1404
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:44,760
 - Okay, yeah.

1405
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:45,840
 - It's a vending machine.

1406
00:47:45,840 --> 00:47:47,320
 In fact, there are dozens of vending machines

1407
00:47:47,320 --> 00:47:49,120
 specifically for Norwegian salmon.

1408
00:47:49,120 --> 00:47:50,880
 - But the salmon always try and swim back

1409
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:52,120
 into the vending machine.

1410
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:54,800
 (all laughing)

1411
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:55,640
 - Yeah, it's bizarre.

1412
00:47:55,640 --> 00:47:59,000
 Norwegian salmon, there were 61 as of 2019,

1413
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,240
 but it stays fresh in there for two years.

1414
00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:02,080
 - Salmon?

1415
00:48:02,080 --> 00:48:02,920
 - 'Cause it's frozen.

1416
00:48:02,920 --> 00:48:03,760
 - Oh, okay.

1417
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:04,600
 - Oh, you know.

1418
00:48:04,600 --> 00:48:05,440
 - Okay.

1419
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:07,400
 - Like Singapore, when you go there,

1420
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:09,680
 and this is again from the viewpoint of a kid,

1421
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:11,040
 it's not particularly weird.

1422
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:13,960
 It was a bit intimidating because of the rules.

1423
00:48:13,960 --> 00:48:16,800
 You were always told, can't chew gum there.

1424
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:17,760
 That's illegal.

1425
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:19,680
 You will be lashed if you chew gum.

1426
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:21,040
 - I remember the teller of that.

1427
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:22,600
 - Yeah, I remember every time I would go there,

1428
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:24,360
 just being like, wow, it's so clean here.

1429
00:48:24,360 --> 00:48:25,560
 And yeah, there's a reason for that.

1430
00:48:25,560 --> 00:48:26,920
 - I've just realized,

1431
00:48:26,920 --> 00:48:28,560
 'cause I remember thinking that as well,

1432
00:48:28,560 --> 00:48:30,240
 but maybe I misunderstood,

1433
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:32,200
 'cause if they're all drinking so much Scotch,

1434
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:34,600
 and they're all getting lashed every day.

1435
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:37,200
 (all laughing)

1436
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:38,760
 Maybe that's what it meant all along.

1437
00:48:38,760 --> 00:48:41,040
 - Yeah, no, it is pretty wild.

1438
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:42,240
 I was surprised actually,

1439
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:44,800
 that the number one imported drink isn't gin.

1440
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:47,320
 That's just because simply of the Singapore Sling,

1441
00:48:47,320 --> 00:48:50,000
 the most famous drink to have the name Singapore

1442
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,560
 in front of it.

1443
00:48:51,560 --> 00:48:53,080
 - What's the second most famous?

1444
00:48:53,080 --> 00:48:54,680
 - There are no others, so yeah.

1445
00:48:54,680 --> 00:48:56,960
 But that is a massive drink there.

1446
00:48:56,960 --> 00:48:59,560
 It was invented in Raffles, the hotel,

1447
00:48:59,560 --> 00:49:01,800
 which is an extraordinary hotel.

1448
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:03,680
 I don't know if you've ever seen pictures of it.

1449
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:04,520
 But you've been to Raffles.

1450
00:49:04,520 --> 00:49:06,080
 - In fact, I've had a Singapore Sling there.

1451
00:49:06,080 --> 00:49:06,920
 - Have you?

1452
00:49:06,920 --> 00:49:07,920
 So yeah, they say they, at the bar,

1453
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:09,200
 which is called the Long Bar,

1454
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:11,960
 they say that about 2,000 Singapore Slings

1455
00:49:11,960 --> 00:49:13,240
 are made per day.

1456
00:49:13,240 --> 00:49:15,840
 - I gotta say, I ordered one, had a sip,

1457
00:49:15,840 --> 00:49:17,280
 and then ordered a beer.

1458
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:18,120
 - Right, really?

1459
00:49:18,120 --> 00:49:18,960
 - I did not like it at all.

1460
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:19,800
 - 'Cause you didn't like it?

1461
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:20,640
 - Yeah, it's too sweet and sour.

1462
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:22,200
 - Yeah, it was basically invented

1463
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:23,680
 by one of the bar staff there,

1464
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:26,840
 because women were not really allowed to drink publicly.

1465
00:49:26,840 --> 00:49:29,920
 And so you make this with pineapple and lime,

1466
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:31,080
 and you put the gin in,

1467
00:49:31,080 --> 00:49:32,920
 but it looks like they're just having a nice fresh juice.

1468
00:49:32,920 --> 00:49:34,920
 And so that's kind of how it kicked off.

1469
00:49:34,920 --> 00:49:36,760
 James, when you went to that bar,

1470
00:49:36,760 --> 00:49:38,440
 did you notice as you walk

1471
00:49:38,440 --> 00:49:41,400
 that your feet were crunching everywhere on shells?

1472
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:42,960
 - Some classy shells?

1473
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:43,800
 - No.

1474
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:44,760
 - I don't recall that.

1475
00:49:44,760 --> 00:49:46,560
 I don't remember it very well, to be honest,

1476
00:49:46,560 --> 00:49:47,880
 'cause it was quite a lot of years ago,

1477
00:49:47,880 --> 00:49:49,280
 but no, I don't think so.

1478
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:50,880
 I remember it being very colonial.

1479
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:52,680
 - Right, so they have peanuts there

1480
00:49:52,680 --> 00:49:54,000
 that they give to you in bags,

1481
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,560
 but they don't give you a plate to put the shells on,

1482
00:49:55,560 --> 00:49:57,400
 because it is tradition to throw them on the floor

1483
00:49:57,400 --> 00:49:58,920
 immediately after you've eaten them.

1484
00:49:58,920 --> 00:49:59,760
 - Oh, really?

1485
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:01,480
 - At the end of the day, they just have to sweep up

1486
00:50:01,480 --> 00:50:04,040
 all the discarded shells that are sitting there.

1487
00:50:04,040 --> 00:50:05,000
 - Nice for the cleaning staff.

1488
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:06,440
 Do they appreciate that tradition?

1489
00:50:06,440 --> 00:50:08,480
 All those migrant laborer cleaning staff?

1490
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:10,560
 - It's part of it, yeah.

1491
00:50:10,560 --> 00:50:12,160
 And also, here's a really interesting fact.

1492
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:14,760
 It is located on number one beach road.

1493
00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:17,960
 However, there is no beach near it.

1494
00:50:17,960 --> 00:50:19,880
 Riddle me this.

1495
00:50:19,880 --> 00:50:22,240
 - Did there used to be a beach near it?

1496
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:25,040
 - There used to be, and there's so much reclaimed land.

1497
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:27,800
 - Oh, it wasn't named after Dylan Thomas's wife,

1498
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:29,400
 he was a nymphomaniac and a beach.

1499
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:31,160
 (all laughing)

1500
00:50:31,160 --> 00:50:32,400
 - First class beach on that.

1501
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:34,880
 (all laughing)

1502
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:35,720
 - There's that wild.

1503
00:50:35,720 --> 00:50:37,120
 There used to be a beach right at the edge of it.

1504
00:50:37,120 --> 00:50:40,440
 It's on beach road and so much land has been added

1505
00:50:40,440 --> 00:50:41,760
 that it's no longer in sight.

1506
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:45,920
 - And Singapore is 20% larger than it was in the '60s.

1507
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:49,840
 And it's basically taken the land from Malaysia and Indonesia,

1508
00:50:49,840 --> 00:50:51,840
 which you would think sounds like a war,

1509
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:55,000
 but they've not gone to war and taken the land in that way.

1510
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,360
 They've gone over there, taken all the sand,

1511
00:50:57,360 --> 00:51:00,620
 and then created new land in Singapore.

1512
00:51:00,620 --> 00:51:02,520
 So the sand comes from different countries.

1513
00:51:02,520 --> 00:51:05,560
 It's Malaysian land, it's Indonesian sand,

1514
00:51:05,560 --> 00:51:07,920
 but it's made Singapore 20% larger.

1515
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:09,800
 - And it's very controversial 'cause it's drained,

1516
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:11,240
 like they've banned it in Indonesia,

1517
00:51:11,240 --> 00:51:12,440
 they banned it a while ago.

1518
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:14,200
 They've officially, I think almost all of it comes

1519
00:51:14,200 --> 00:51:16,760
 from Cambodia now because it got banned elsewhere.

1520
00:51:16,760 --> 00:51:19,200
 Cambodia banned it, but you can still make a huge amount

1521
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:21,920
 of money as a Cambodian who's willing to get your sacks out

1522
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:24,220
 and collect loads of sand and export it.

1523
00:51:24,220 --> 00:51:25,560
 - Sounds muggling, yeah.

1524
00:51:25,560 --> 00:51:26,720
 - 'Cause it is, I think a lot of stuff

1525
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:28,720
 about Singapore is to do with the fact it's so small.

1526
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:30,140
 And they import so much of their food

1527
00:51:30,140 --> 00:51:32,460
 that they have to have innovative solutions

1528
00:51:32,460 --> 00:51:35,640
 for feeding themselves and supplying their own stuff.

1529
00:51:35,640 --> 00:51:37,240
 - And they've smashed that.

1530
00:51:37,240 --> 00:51:38,480
 It was always the chart when I went,

1531
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:40,520
 I mean, which it was 20 years ago, but I think it's the same.

1532
00:51:40,520 --> 00:51:43,080
 The only two things people ever told you about Singapore

1533
00:51:43,080 --> 00:51:45,320
 and no offense to Singaporeans, I know there's more,

1534
00:51:45,320 --> 00:51:48,440
 but the airport's amazing and the food's incredible.

1535
00:51:48,440 --> 00:51:49,960
 And actually, when you live for three days,

1536
00:51:49,960 --> 00:51:52,400
 once you know the food is the only thing really to do there,

1537
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:55,160
 once you've had kind of four meals in a row,

1538
00:51:55,160 --> 00:51:57,440
 it's like, "Well, I can't enjoy this anymore.

1539
00:51:57,440 --> 00:51:58,440
 What am I gonna do now?"

1540
00:51:58,440 --> 00:51:59,600
 - How can you stop enjoying food?

1541
00:51:59,600 --> 00:52:01,320
 - I've had them within about two hours.

1542
00:52:01,320 --> 00:52:04,320
 He's just gone round stuffing your face.

1543
00:52:04,320 --> 00:52:05,880
 - Actually, I just thought of something

1544
00:52:05,880 --> 00:52:09,900
 that they did in Singapore that's like the NFL stuff,

1545
00:52:09,900 --> 00:52:14,080
 which is they turn the car parks into like food halls.

1546
00:52:14,080 --> 00:52:14,920
 - Oh, really?

1547
00:52:14,920 --> 00:52:15,760
 - I'm sure they do that.

1548
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:17,800
 Yeah, I remember going to, it was like an old car park.

1549
00:52:17,800 --> 00:52:20,600
 Once the car park closed and all the cars had gone,

1550
00:52:20,600 --> 00:52:24,400
 suddenly it just opens up and they sell durian and--

1551
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:25,640
 - Yeah, okay, that sounds likely.

1552
00:52:25,640 --> 00:52:26,480
 - That's the big thing, isn't it?

1553
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:27,320
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1554
00:52:27,320 --> 00:52:29,400
 - There's like one huge food hall.

1555
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:32,600
 - Graves, 'cause there's so little space going.

1556
00:52:32,600 --> 00:52:34,800
 - They have to be all shaped like bananas

1557
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:37,520
 and they kind of tessellate with each other, don't they?

1558
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:39,120
 - They're all spooning.

1559
00:52:39,120 --> 00:52:40,240
 - Oh, sweet.

1560
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:41,920
 - No, you get, they're digging up,

1561
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:43,560
 there used to be a couple of hundred cemeteries

1562
00:52:43,560 --> 00:52:45,760
 in Singapore, now there are only about 60 left,

1563
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:47,080
 because they just need space.

1564
00:52:47,080 --> 00:52:49,240
 You get 15 years only in the ground

1565
00:52:49,240 --> 00:52:52,080
 if you choose to be buried and then you have to go elsewhere.

1566
00:52:52,080 --> 00:52:53,600
 - Obviously, as we've said,

1567
00:52:53,600 --> 00:52:55,440
 they're kind of big on their rules

1568
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:59,040
 and trying to stop people from doing certain things.

1569
00:52:59,040 --> 00:53:02,640
 There was an anti-gambling advert in 2014

1570
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:05,160
 and this featured a little boy called Andy

1571
00:53:05,160 --> 00:53:06,920
 and he was complaining to his friends

1572
00:53:06,920 --> 00:53:09,360
 that his dad had bet his life savings

1573
00:53:09,360 --> 00:53:11,520
 on Germany winning the World Cup

1574
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:14,520
 and Germany then won the 2014 World Cup.

1575
00:53:14,520 --> 00:53:17,100
 (all laughing)

1576
00:53:17,100 --> 00:53:22,120
 And the National Council on Problem Gambling said

1577
00:53:22,120 --> 00:53:23,920
 that they decided to choose Germany

1578
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:25,880
 because they thought they were very unlikely to win,

1579
00:53:25,880 --> 00:53:28,200
 but at least it would be realistic.

1580
00:53:28,200 --> 00:53:30,200
 - You can never bet against the Germans in a World Cup.

1581
00:53:30,200 --> 00:53:32,080
 - Exactly, they should have known.

1582
00:53:32,080 --> 00:53:33,280
 But obviously everyone thought

1583
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:36,360
 that this was encouraging people to gamble.

1584
00:53:36,360 --> 00:53:38,120
 So the council revamped the advert

1585
00:53:38,120 --> 00:53:41,160
 and Andy, the little boy says, his friend asks,

1586
00:53:41,160 --> 00:53:43,400
 "Your dad's team won, did you get your money back?"

1587
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:45,160
 And he said, "No, dad never stops,

1588
00:53:45,160 --> 00:53:47,720
 he wants to bet one more time,"

1589
00:53:47,720 --> 00:53:49,560
 on which he bet on Leicester winning

1590
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:50,960
 the next year's Premier League.

1591
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:51,800
 (all laughing)

1592
00:53:51,800 --> 00:53:52,640
 - No, he didn't.

1593
00:53:52,640 --> 00:53:54,720
 (all laughing)

1594
00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:55,560
 - That's so funny.

1595
00:53:55,560 --> 00:53:56,400
 Yeah, lots of things banned.

1596
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:58,000
 That's the only thing I know.

1597
00:53:58,000 --> 00:53:59,760
 Chewing gum, I know, obviously.

1598
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:02,120
 But I mean, it's pretty draconian there, isn't it?

1599
00:54:02,120 --> 00:54:05,280
 So you can still be caned if you're a man under the age of 50.

1600
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:06,880
 - Another euphemism for getting drunk.

1601
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:08,360
 - Oh no, yeah, you're right.

1602
00:54:08,360 --> 00:54:09,960
 But you can really, like, they have a cane

1603
00:54:09,960 --> 00:54:12,920
 and they will, and it's sort of minor levels of crime,

1604
00:54:12,920 --> 00:54:14,400
 but it's really painful.

1605
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:15,360
 Like, it's really bad.

1606
00:54:15,360 --> 00:54:16,200
 And there are all sorts of rumours

1607
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:17,960
 about the procedure, it just, it's just--

1608
00:54:17,960 --> 00:54:20,520
 - I thought that J-Walking could get you caned,

1609
00:54:20,520 --> 00:54:22,400
 like, is what I thought when I went there.

1610
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:23,880
 I don't know if it was true, but--

1611
00:54:23,880 --> 00:54:26,520
 - Mine of vandalism does.

1612
00:54:26,520 --> 00:54:28,400
 - Weeing in a lift, Dan, you were there as a child,

1613
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:29,560
 did you say?

1614
00:54:29,560 --> 00:54:32,840
 - Not at that age, but yeah.

1615
00:54:32,840 --> 00:54:33,920
 - 'Cause they had a huge problem

1616
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:35,000
 with people weeing in the lift.

1617
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:35,840
 - Sorry, sorry.

1618
00:54:35,840 --> 00:54:38,000
 At what age did you stop weeing in the lift, Dan?

1619
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:39,600
 (all laughing)

1620
00:54:39,600 --> 00:54:40,800
 - Like 23.

1621
00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:42,760
 (all laughing)

1622
00:54:42,760 --> 00:54:44,120
 - You're Dylan Thomas' face.

1623
00:54:44,120 --> 00:54:46,760
 (all laughing)

1624
00:54:46,760 --> 00:54:48,560
 - Yeah, 'cause everyone lives in high-rise buildings,

1625
00:54:48,560 --> 00:54:50,160
 and in the '60s and '70s,

1626
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:53,440
 every lift stank of piss, and it was horrible,

1627
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:55,600
 and they had suggestions of how do we combat this,

1628
00:54:55,600 --> 00:54:57,400
 'cause it's a really nasty social problem.

1629
00:54:57,400 --> 00:54:59,640
 One block of flats just bought its own lift attendant,

1630
00:54:59,640 --> 00:55:00,880
 like everyone chipped in,

1631
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:02,600
 and you'd have someone to, you know, press the buttons,

1632
00:55:02,600 --> 00:55:04,440
 but also stop anyone weeing.

1633
00:55:04,440 --> 00:55:07,800
 And eventually, in the 1988 war on piss,

1634
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:11,680
 they installed urine detectors in lifts,

1635
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:12,880
 and had a crack down,

1636
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:15,040
 and if a drop of weed hits the floor,

1637
00:55:15,040 --> 00:55:16,760
 that urine detector detects it,

1638
00:55:16,760 --> 00:55:18,960
 the lift slams to a halt,

1639
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:21,560
 and you have to wait there until the authorities come

1640
00:55:21,560 --> 00:55:23,000
 and drag you off to Chokey.

1641
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:24,280
 - Oh my God.

1642
00:55:24,280 --> 00:55:25,520
 - And the first people calling for it,

1643
00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:27,600
 were I think, you know, boys who were just sort of...

1644
00:55:27,600 --> 00:55:30,360
 - I wanna know, 'cause they had this problem

1645
00:55:30,360 --> 00:55:33,480
 in other countries that most people live in high-rise.

1646
00:55:33,480 --> 00:55:36,520
 You're so close to home when you're in a lift.

1647
00:55:36,520 --> 00:55:37,520
 - What if you're going out?

1648
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:39,520
 (all laughing)

1649
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:42,880
 - It feels like go before you leave, right?

1650
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:44,680
 It just feels like you're so close

1651
00:55:44,680 --> 00:55:47,280
 to having either just left your toilet,

1652
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:48,920
 or just arriving at your toilet.

1653
00:55:48,920 --> 00:55:50,040
 - But you know what it's like.

1654
00:55:50,040 --> 00:55:51,400
 When you really need the loo,

1655
00:55:51,400 --> 00:55:52,760
 you suddenly can't hold it anymore

1656
00:55:52,760 --> 00:55:54,520
 when you're 10 yards from your front door, right?

1657
00:55:54,520 --> 00:55:55,880
 - Yeah, you let your guard down a bit, and then...

1658
00:55:55,880 --> 00:55:57,400
 - Exactly, you relax.

1659
00:55:57,400 --> 00:55:59,680
 - I don't think it's people who are incapable.

1660
00:55:59,680 --> 00:56:01,000
 I don't think it's people who are almost home

1661
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:02,240
 who just can't hold it anymore.

1662
00:56:02,240 --> 00:56:03,320
 I think it was just a...

1663
00:56:03,320 --> 00:56:05,160
 I don't know, if I was visiting your home though, James,

1664
00:56:05,160 --> 00:56:06,760
 I might we in the lift on the way up

1665
00:56:06,760 --> 00:56:08,640
 just to kind of mark the territory.

1666
00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:10,160
 - Why don't I live in a ground floor flat?

1667
00:56:10,160 --> 00:56:12,400
 (all laughing)

1668
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:15,360
 - Through the front window, or whatever it might be.

1669
00:56:15,360 --> 00:56:17,940
 (upbeat music)

1670
00:56:18,460 --> 00:56:20,780
 (upbeat music)

1671
00:56:20,780 --> 00:56:21,620
 - Okay, that's it.

1672
00:56:21,620 --> 00:56:22,620
 That is all of our facts.
