00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,620
 Hi everybody, Dan and Andy here. We're just letting you know about our special guest this week.

2
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:10,400
 This is such a fun show. It was recorded live in Belgium at a festival called Nerdland.

3
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:15,720
 And it's with one of our very oldest friends and one of the first ever guests we had on the show.

4
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:21,340
 Yeah, that's right. It is the almighty Belgian science comedian, Leven Skynra.

5
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:26,860
 Leven is someone who has been with us from the get-go. As Andy says, he's appeared a few times.

6
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:33,040
 He's brought us over to Belgium in the past and we got to go to his geek-created festival called Nerdland,

7
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:38,340
 which was just packed with scientists from all over the country and for some reason, us.

8
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:45,880
 And we played this massive tent. We had to fill our slot without Anna and Leven very kindly jumped into place

9
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:51,680
 and played with us on stage and he's just someone who you absolutely need to find out more about.

10
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:58,560
 And in fact, his live show, which is called DNA, has been released on his website, Levenskynra.com,

11
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:05,300
 as an English version of his science comedy show. And that's really worth checking out. It's online now, streaming.

12
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:11,560
 So, give that a go. And the other thing we should let you know is that if you enjoy this live show,

13
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:16,560
 we have another live show coming up. There are very few tickets left for our Soho Theatre dates this summer,

14
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:21,300
 but we have just added another live show, which is going to be at the London Podcast Festival.

15
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:28,260
 It's on the 14th of September. It's at 7pm. It's in London, obviously, but it's going to be streamed as well.

16
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:33,300
 So you'll be able to buy tickets wherever you are in the world. It's going to be so much fun. We would love to see you there.

17
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:39,520
 That's right. Yeah. So get booking the physical in-store tickets, as they were, so you could be there with us in the room.

18
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:44,380
 But if you can't make it, do get the online tickets. And to get those tickets, all you need to do is go to

19
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:50,640
 nosuchthingasafish.com/podfest. You'll find the links there to buy the appropriate things.

20
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:56,440
 And otherwise, we hope you get a taster of what we're like live, nicely, with this episode,

21
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:59,860
 with our good mate, Leaven Skyra, coming to you live from Belgium.

22
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:00,780
 Hooray!

23
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:02,280
 Come on with the show.

24
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:04,520
 (Buzzing)

25
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:16,000
 (Speaking in Japanese)

26
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:23,820
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast this week coming to you live

27
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:27,680
 from the Nerdland Festival in Belgium!

28
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:34,720
 (Cheering)

29
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:41,160
 My name is Dan Schreiber. I am sitting here with Andrew Hunt and Murray James Harkin and Leaven Skyra.

30
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:46,520
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days.

31
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:53,040
 And in no particular order, here we go. Starting with fact number one, and that is Andy.

32
00:02:53,040 --> 00:03:00,240
 My fact is that, in the 1970s, NASA employees had to walk around holding broomsticks in front of them

33
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:03,160
 to detect invisible fires.

34
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:04,960
 Ooh. Yeah.

35
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:08,640
 I didn't even know that, in fact, now I'm worried about invisible fires.

36
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:09,360
 You should be.

37
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,400
 Because we don't have anyone with brooms here. How would we know that there wasn't one?

38
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,160
 We just wouldn't. So, you know, stay vigilant, I suppose.

39
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:21,920
 So, what were people noticing that it was only janitors who weren't going up in flames?

40
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:25,600
 Yeah, I didn't know about invisible fires. Oh, I should say, this is a fact from Anna Welch,

41
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:29,680
 who sent it in to us at the podcast email address. So, thank you so much, Anna.

42
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:36,560
 It's because NASA uses liquid hydrogen for lots of their rockets, and since the 1950s they've been using it.

43
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:40,520
 And it's incredibly flammable. It's a great fuel for a rocket.

44
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:44,320
 It burns at 5,000 degrees Fahrenheit. It's ultra-explosive.

45
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:49,520
 But, of course, hydrogen, first atom, first element in the periodic table, it's tiny.

46
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:52,960
 The atoms are incredibly small, and it's very flammable.

47
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:59,280
 And because the atoms are so small, it leaks. It can leak, even if you've welded two plates of metal together,

48
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,160
 you can get hydrogen.

49
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:02,800
 Just like a little hole in the weld, and it'll just sneak through.

50
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:09,840
 Exactly. And because it's quite temperamental, a high-pressurized amount of hydrogen can easily become a fire.

51
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:14,480
 However, the flame burns with this incredibly pale blue flame. You almost can't see it.

52
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:19,360
 And so, this was a real problem. So, NASA employees, to detect if they had a hydrogen fire,

53
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:22,640
 in the situation, had to walk around holding a broomstick.

54
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:29,120
 And when the head of the broom caught fire, they knew that that was the problem, basically.

55
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,800
 And that's it. That's what they had to do.

56
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,640
 I do hope there's video footage of this.

57
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:37,280
 All these brilliant engineers with sticks just walking around.

58
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,280
 Have you heard of this leaving? Like, you do science?

59
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:44,400
 No. No, I haven't heard of the broomstick story. I know that hydrogen fires are a thing.

60
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:48,960
 My father worked in a steel factory, so they also had hydrogen in pipes.

61
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:55,040
 And like you said, the smallest leakage, the hydrogen would come out, and it would ignite,

62
00:04:55,040 --> 00:05:00,720
 my dad told me, it would ignite from the heat of a piece of dust hitting the side of the pipe.

63
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:06,560
 That would be enough to ignite the hydrogen, and so then you have your invisible flame.

64
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:11,760
 That's incredible. Obviously, flame is a huge problem for NASA, generally.

65
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:14,720
 They hate fires. They're really not keen on fires, NASA.

66
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:17,520
 Unless it's at the very bottom of the rocket, shooting them up.

67
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:22,000
 That's the one time they like fires. Otherwise, it's a really bad thing.

68
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,480
 So back when they were trying to work out the Apollo missions and who was going to be flying to space,

69
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:30,320
 there was a guy who was hired as basically the fart researcher.

70
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:35,200
 And because there's methane in the farts, and if you're in a tin can going back to the moon,

71
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:38,560
 it's going to catch on fire. So there was a guy called Edwin Murphy,

72
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:43,360
 who at the 1964 conference of nutrition and space and related waste problems,

73
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:47,680
 pitched that we needed to find astronauts who didn't fart with methane.

74
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:53,040
 With methane, right? Does that exist? He found them. He's like, they're out there.

75
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:56,480
 Is that Buzz and Neil Armstrong? They don't fart?

76
00:05:56,480 --> 00:06:02,160
 Because I've been in a lift with Buzz Aldrin. I can't say that he didn't fart.

77
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:09,200
 The farts are produced by your gut bacteria. So the reason that some foods produce more

78
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:14,400
 fart is because they go all the way down in your gut, like things with lots of fibers,

79
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:19,360
 such as Brussels sprouts. And the fibers take food to the downside of your gut.

80
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:25,440
 And so the bacteria eat them and produce this methane. And when you can't digest lactose,

81
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:30,560
 then it will also find all its way down. So in order to fart, you have to feed your bacteria

82
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:36,560
 all the way down. But not all of us have bacteria that produce methane. I, however,

83
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:42,400
 do because I was tested. Were you? Yes. We had a science show. What's the test?

84
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:48,400
 It's not just, it's not a lighter, is it? I can, I can leave it up to your imagination,

85
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:53,200
 but you can test it with a lighter because you can actually light it at the source.

86
00:06:53,200 --> 00:07:00,000
 So, yeah. But if you produce this methane in your gut, it will end up in your blood and in your

87
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,800
 breath. So I simply took a breath test and then they saw I had methane. The reason we did this

88
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:13,760
 was because we found an old patent of a fart gun. And so what? Yes, the fart gun. This is a toy gun.

89
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:19,040
 Yeah. And you put a dart in it. Yeah. And then it has a small chamber. When you feel a fart coming

90
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:25,600
 up, you press the chamber against your butt. While you fart, you pull the lever, it fills

91
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:29,760
 up with methane. You pull the trigger and the dart flies out. Which way is the dart flying?

92
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:36,160
 Whatever direction you prefer, Mr. Schweiger. That is amazing. I think I did it wrong.

93
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:40,960
 That's a patent. They've never made one of those, have they? They have been produced

94
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:47,120
 and we have reproduced them with a 3D printer. And after many attempts, over 50 attempts,

95
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:52,480
 one dart flew through the room. That's incorrect. Wow, really. Yeah. So it's about 50% of people

96
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:57,920
 who don't have methane in their farts. And he created a special bean meal whereby he had you

97
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:02,800
 eat it and then you farted into a sort of rectal catheter and it collected the farts. Brilliant.

98
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:06,240
 And he pitched it and they said, "We'll just give them less farty food in space."

99
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:12,240
 Spoils spots. Yeah. Okay. This is another fact sent in actually by someone called Don Padden.

100
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:18,160
 And it's a memoir of NASA in the 1960s. And he wrote a memoir of what had happened in his life.

101
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:22,960
 And one incident, a terrible incident that happened at NASA was an accidental activation

102
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:29,040
 of the launch tower water deluge system. So, you know, huge, like a massive sprinkler system

103
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:33,360
 basically designed to just shut down any disastrous fire that might be happening.

104
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:40,000
 And it was an area gas hydrogen detector. So the problem was it wasn't a hydrogen leak that had

105
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,880
 caused this system to go off this deluge. The cause was, and he wrote up in his report in his

106
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:52,960
 memoir, "Gasious emissions of robust Chrysler senior engineer." What? He had been up working,

107
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:56,960
 like fixing an engineering problem on the hydrogen tank and farting at the time.

108
00:08:56,960 --> 00:09:01,680
 And they didn't know until this point that the detector could smell human farts. They thought

109
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:07,600
 it was just a hydrogen leak detector, but it turned out... That's amazing. Oh my God. Millions of

110
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:14,000
 dollars of damage. Yeah. Leeman, I want you to imagine now you're on Apollo 11 making your way

111
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,160
 up to the moon. And I have one question for you. Would you like still or sparkling water?

112
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:26,320
 Oh, I think I would like still water. Well, you can't. The reason being that on Apollo 11,

113
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:31,600
 there was a hydrogen filter on the water and it leaked. And it meant that hydrogen got into the

114
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:37,520
 water. And so all the water was fizzy. Wait away. But water already contains hydrogen. Yes, it does,

115
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:42,000
 but this had super amount of hydrogen in it. So they had sparkling water on the moon.

116
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,400
 It had sparkling water. That's nice. That's really, that's very posh. You want to celebrate,

117
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:52,000
 don't you? You do. Yeah. I think we're two-thirds of all the atoms in all of our bodies are hydrogen.

118
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,840
 It's all right. A little shout out for hydrogen. Yeah, it's very important. But why are we not

119
00:09:55,840 --> 00:10:00,880
 setting on fire all the time? Why are we not exploding? Because they're bound to a molecule.

120
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:05,360
 I wanted to add the torch to that one. And I'm thrilled that you answered it.

121
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:11,360
 You were just about to say that, I guess. Probably. I was looking into other invisible

122
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:15,680
 things at NASA. And I found this really cool website, which is called NASA Spinoff, where they're

123
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:21,440
 quite proud that a thing that was invented for NASA and space is now an everyday object in our

124
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:25,520
 world. So on the list of things that they have, there was a company in conjunction with NASA's

125
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:30,720
 Advanced Ceramics Research. They were trying to use protection for infrared antennae on heat-seeking

126
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:35,840
 missile trackers. That was one of their things they were doing. That technology is now invisible

127
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:40,880
 braces that people have on their teeth. That was originally for a heat-seeking missile. And

128
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:46,480
 then they were like, "Oh, we should put this on people's faces as well." They did scratch-resistant

129
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:51,840
 lenses. Very proud of that. The space blanket. What's the space blanket? It's basically a

130
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:56,080
 lightweight and reflect infrared radiation. Is it not that thing after you've run a marathon,

131
00:10:56,080 --> 00:11:02,640
 they put it around you? Exactly. Yes, the gold side and the silver side. And one side has to be

132
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:06,960
 on the outside when you're overheated. And the other side has to be on the outside when you're

133
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:12,080
 too cold. Is that so? Yeah. I think when you're too cold, I think the gold side has to be on the

134
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:18,160
 inside. And when you're too hot, I think the gold side has to be on the outside. Could be the exact

135
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:26,800
 other way around. I do not take legal responsibility. So there was this big piece of this around

136
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:35,200
 Apollo 11. And one millimeter, one square millimeter of this material is now at my desk.

137
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:42,000
 I have bought one square millimeter of this material that has been on the moon.

138
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,640
 That's what happens when they go back and they find they're missing.

139
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:53,200
 Then hydrogen leaks out. Three astronauts died today because of a Belgian comedian scientist.

140
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:58,560
 One last thing, so memory foam mattress was also a NASA invention. And then my favorite,

141
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:05,040
 space age swimsuits. They invented a swimsuit. I don't know why. There's no water in space,

142
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:10,960
 at least not in the ISS so far. But they built it. And it's been used now by various different

143
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:15,440
 companies in order to turn it into actual swimsuits. But what does it do? It just makes you

144
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:22,560
 swim in space, I guess. What? It's just really fine material. And the materials used in actual

145
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:27,840
 human earth swimming now. And the first time it was used in 2008, there were 13 swimming records

146
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:33,120
 that were broken immediately. Oh, really? Is it the one they got banned? The laser, the laser

147
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:41,520
 suits. Yeah, that was kind of based on like a shark skin, wasn't it? And also it kind of made you

148
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:46,080
 float in the water, which they thought probably wasn't fair. How can you break so many records?

149
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:51,040
 I mean, they're such small, small swimsuits. How can that make that much of a difference in the

150
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:56,400
 whole body with their full body swimsuits? Oh, I'm thinking of the, yeah. I don't know if you've

151
00:12:56,400 --> 00:13:01,360
 ever watched the Olympic swimming. They're not in bikinis. You're going to be staggered to hear,

152
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:06,240
 James. I've never seen any swimming competition ever. But here's what's crazy. You're saying that

153
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:11,440
 you've got that little bit of the gold from the Apollo 11. James and I have seen the little patch

154
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:17,200
 that's missing from the shark that was taken by, I believe it was Adidas at Nike to make this

155
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:20,160
 material. It was at the Natural History Museum in Montana. Wait, do you mean a piece of actual

156
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:25,120
 shark skin? They have the shark where it's missing the patch that then is turned into the swimsuit

157
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:29,360
 that was donated from the museum. Yeah. We're going to have to move on to our next fact in a second.

158
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:36,160
 Okay. Just on hydrogen, do you know what happens if you have some potassium and you get water on it?

159
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:43,360
 It's a big boom. Yeah, a big boom, like a big explosion. Loads of hydrogen get shot out. And

160
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:51,680
 there was a in 1849, doctors turned up at a man's house and they found that his penis was stuck in

161
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:59,040
 a bottle. And the bottle opening was only 1.9 centimeters in diameter. Okay. And what he'd

162
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:02,960
 been doing was he'd been doing some experiments with potassium. I was just trying to get the ship

163
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:10,800
 out of the bottle. My finger wasn't quite managing to do the job. He was doing some experiments with

164
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:15,920
 potassium. And he woke up in the middle of the night and decided that he needed to have a pee.

165
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:20,000
 And went to pee in a bottle, which happened to be the thing that he'd been doing his potassium

166
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:26,320
 experiments in. The urine reacted with the potassium. There was a massive explosion. All the

167
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:38,880
 hydrogen left the bottle, leaving a vacuum that sucked his penis. I think you're starting a new fetish

168
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:47,120
 here. Penis in a bottle. I'd buy one. You tried potassium. Yeah. Can you imagine him calling

169
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:56,080
 the doctors going, what am I going to say? Hi. Oh, man. I got one more invisible story. Okay. Yeah.

170
00:14:56,080 --> 00:15:01,920
 It was, I think it was in Spain. It was this region where a chameleon had lived. And then

171
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:05,840
 suddenly they saw like, oh, it's nature is having a hard time. And suddenly they saw like, okay,

172
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:12,960
 this chameleon went extinct. A few years later, they said, oh, they didn't just didn't see them.

173
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:19,360
 So they actually rediscovered this chameleon that was extinct because their camouflage was so good.

174
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:31,040
 Brilliant. I love it. All right, we need to move on to our second fact. It is time for fact number

175
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:38,800
 two. And that is leaving. My fact is that in 2015, it was discovered that only one person alive

176
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:55,600
 understands the Belgian tax system. I think that went down a lot better here than it might

177
00:15:55,600 --> 00:16:03,440
 have done in London. Probably. We're so proud of the faults in our country. So this is an article

178
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:10,320
 from the dead, which is our financial newspaper. And Belgium is, it's a complex country. And we

179
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:16,240
 have to divide taxes. We have the federal government for the entire country. Then we have three regions.

180
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:21,120
 Flanders is the Dutch speaking north. Bologna is the French speaking south. And then we have

181
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:25,840
 Brussels, which is an independent region, and it's bilingual. There's a small part of Wallonia

182
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:31,200
 that speaks German. They have their own government. The French speaking people in Brussels and

183
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:37,760
 Wallonia have their own government also. So we have, let's see, three governments for the regions,

184
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:42,560
 two or three for the languages, and then one federal government. Sorry, Leven, can I just ask,

185
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:47,760
 are you the one person who understands this? And you're explaining it to us now. This is

186
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:54,080
 just setting the scene. We pay our taxes to Belgium, the Federation, but then they have to

187
00:16:54,080 --> 00:17:00,160
 give some money to the regions because they have their responsibility. Education is for the regions,

188
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:05,920
 but then, of course, the army is for the Federation. The Flemish coast, so the beach

189
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:12,480
 is Flanders. The North Sea is Belgium. So if you want to clean...

190
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:18,560
 Why? So when does one become... Yeah. When are you leaving Flanders and entering Belgium?

191
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:24,720
 The moment you step in the sea, then you're in Belgium. And when the tide comes in,

192
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:36,960
 is that counted as an invasion? Yeah, well, probably. That's why we build sand castles to keep Flanders.

193
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:45,520
 But so if you want to clean the beach, you need Flemish money. If you want to clean the sea,

194
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:51,120
 you need federal money. The result is that there's a constant lobbying of how much money goes to the

195
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:58,320
 regions a bit more, a bit less. You have all kinds of factors. Some of the factors are how many people

196
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:04,400
 are in school. So not the complete population, but people in school. How many people are retired?

197
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:10,080
 No, yeah, because that's also an extra cost. And so they're always playing like, if we move the

198
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:16,160
 factors around, then we get a bit more money, things like that. In 2015, the Flemish government

199
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:20,880
 and the Walloon government get a letter from the tax administration, the federal tax administration,

200
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:28,480
 they said, "We did the miscalculation. We need 750 million euros back." And so, of course,

201
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:36,480
 these governments of the regions said, "Okay, we'd like a second opinion." And the tax, the federal

202
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:43,360
 tax system said, "There is no second opinion. Only Karin understands this problem."

203
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:54,960
 So, can I ask, even so, this person now feels like the most important person in the entirety of

204
00:18:54,960 --> 00:19:02,800
 Belgium? So, is she on the armed guard? Well, Karin Spinwa, she was contacted by the press and she

205
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:07,600
 wants nothing to do with the press. She's a numbers person. She's a mathematician. She's very good

206
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:13,440
 with numbers. She makes the excel sheets. She's sitting at home counting her 750 million euros,

207
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:20,240
 I think. Well, you do understand the Belgian psyche. Very good. But she says no photos of her

208
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:26,320
 online. We know virtually nothing about her. No. I have met a person who has met her.

209
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:32,880
 And so, at that point, it was published in this newspaper. They said, "Only one person understands

210
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:38,080
 this." And then they said, "What if something happens to her?" And they panicked and they

211
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:46,240
 immediately gave her an assistant. So now there's two. We have a spare one. That's nice. And they're

212
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:50,960
 not allowed to travel together and this kind of thing. There are loads of people like that.

213
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:56,000
 The Wright brothers, they weren't allowed to fly together. I think like members of the

214
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:00,160
 British royal family. I don't know. Is that true that they're not allowed to? Supposedly. I keep

215
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:05,360
 saying to you guys that the people who do the parachutes that bring capsules back in from space

216
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:10,720
 are not allowed to travel with each other because they hand knit. What do you do for a parachute

217
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:17,280
 stitch? So, yeah. And only a few people know how to do it is the rumor. Andy, you always say

218
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:22,320
 whenever we're going to a gig that you don't want to travel in the same carriage as us. Weirdly,

219
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:31,200
 that's nothing to do with this. Oh. So just a personality problem of mine. So Leven, why not?

220
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:37,440
 So they're teaching the assistant. Why not teach, you know, three people? Why not? Don't be ridiculous.

221
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:45,680
 There isn't the budget for that. Well, probably a bit more people know this now. I haven't followed

222
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:52,480
 the story since 2015. Also, there's probably a few people in academia who understand this too,

223
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:57,200
 but they're not allowed to do official calculations. So they could only ask this one person and now

224
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:02,800
 there's two and hopefully a bit more by now. Wow. I was looking at a few other taxes. Did you hear

225
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:09,680
 about the bachelor tax of Argentina? No. Okay. This was in about 1900. Basically, I think there were

226
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:14,160
 tax breaks or tax relief if you were married. But there was a problem, of course, which is what do

227
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:19,600
 you do with men who wanted to get married and have proposed to a woman, but they've been rejected.

228
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:24,240
 You know, it's not their fault they're not married. They want to be married. They deserve some kind of

229
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:29,200
 break on the tax. The system developed where they said, okay, well, if you've, fine, if you've proposed

230
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:32,560
 to someone who've been rejected, you can have the tax break. Well, how do you prove that? How do you

231
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:37,680
 prove it? So basically, if a woman said no when you propose marriage, you could then say, will you

232
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:46,320
 least sign this certificate of tax exemption for me? But then people started getting around the

233
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:50,480
 problem, like men who didn't want to get married. They thought, well, I want this tax break too.

234
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:57,600
 So there emerged this small class of professional women who would guarantee say no to you when you

235
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:02,800
 propose marriage to them. I've met all of them in my teenage years, I must say. I have to think

236
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:08,880
 about the British tax system, which is sounds quite simple. I mean, relative to the Belgian tax

237
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:13,920
 system, it sounds relatively simple. But nonetheless, people in the UK, they're often late with their

238
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:22,640
 taxes. And every year, HMRC, the British tax office, they will, they accept some excuses, you know,

239
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:27,520
 if there was a flood or a sudden illness, you know, they'll say, okay, you don't have to pay a fine

240
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:32,880
 because your taxes late. But also every year, they print the best excuses they've had.

241
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:41,440
 All year. So okay, these are all from the last few years. Okay, my tax return was on my yacht,

242
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:47,200
 which caught fire. And by the way, I want to claim against the loss of a yacht.

243
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:52,160
 My wife helps me with my tax return, but she had a headache for 10 days.

244
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:56,880
 My husband left me and took our accountant with him.

245
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:05,920
 My ex-wife left my tax return upstairs, but I suffer from vertigo and can't go upstairs to

246
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:13,600
 retrieve it. And my favorite, I was too stunned after seeing a volcanic eruption on TV to concentrate

247
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:21,760
 on anything. Brilliant. That's a good one. I've got a British tax story too. Yeah, it's the fact

248
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:29,360
 that in 1999, at a UK court because of taxes, it was decided that Jaffa cakes are cakes and not

249
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:35,680
 cookies. Okay. So Jaffa cakes for those who do not know it. In Belgium, we call it pimps cookies,

250
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:45,680
 pimps cakes. Sorry, what did you call it? Pimps cookies? Yeah. Yeah. This is the Shire and we are

251
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:51,120
 not offensive Europe. So that's, that's what we do. So for those who do not know whether you have

252
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:58,640
 this spongy, spongy cake, a small circle, maybe five centimeters diameter, then there's a bit of

253
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:06,320
 orange jam and then there's a chocolate above it. So turns out that cookies with chocolate have

254
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:12,400
 higher taxes than cake because cookies with chocolate are a luxury product and a cake is

255
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:18,080
 considered a staple food. So Jaffa cake said, we're selling cake, so we don't have to pay the VAT.

256
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:22,480
 And then the court said, no, these are clearly cookies. And they said, let's take it to court.

257
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:29,680
 And so they had an actual case, cookies against cake. Some of the arguments that were given,

258
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:35,520
 one argument from the government, from the tax system was, we do not eat Jaffa cakes with forks.

259
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:44,160
 Oh, disagree. Yeah. Well, yeah. Also the size, the fact that you don't stack cakes on top of each

260
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:51,280
 other. The argument was won by the cakes. So by the cookie producer, they are still cakes legally

261
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:57,680
 because one of the deciding arguments was that Jaffa cakes will harden when they go stale and

262
00:24:57,680 --> 00:25:06,080
 biscuits will go soggy. Okay. And the ultimate argument was somebody baked a cake size Jaffa cake.

263
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:11,360
 Brilliant. So they came to the courtroom with a cake sized Jaffa cake. I said, she told you.

264
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:17,600
 And then it was decided. Wow. That's incredible. Why doesn't John Grisham write novels with these

265
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:24,240
 plot lines for his court cases? I wanted to ask you about a thing that happens here in Belgium,

266
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:27,520
 which is there's a place which I'm going to pronounce it wrong. Maybe you can say it.

267
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:36,320
 Everybody here knows what we're talking about. It sounds fascinating, guys. It sounds incredible.

268
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:41,680
 I've been there. It's where the two countries border. Yeah. Yeah. As a result, it's really

269
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:46,400
 odd because you can make decisions that work to your advantage in so many different places. I don't

270
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:52,160
 know if anyone's been there when they were younger, but the laws of drinking have different ages. So

271
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:57,840
 in one country, it's 18. The other 16. So also firing a fart capsule is a criminal offense in

272
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:03,520
 Balahertog, but it's not a Balnasa. So that's when Belgium and the Netherlands were split.

273
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:09,520
 There were some landowners like nobility who lived in Holland, like a few kilometers in Holland,

274
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:14,880
 but they wanted to be Belgian because they were well, they had they had liaisons with the Belgian

275
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:21,040
 royalty. And so they said, all my land is Belgian. But like a farmer, they had a peaceful and they're

276
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:25,280
 a piece of land. They're a piece of land there. So it looks like this ripped off piece of paper

277
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:29,840
 that was sprinkled over Holland. So there's a piece of Belgium in Holland and in this piece

278
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:35,840
 of Belgium, there's a piece of Holland. So that's the thing that we used to be a bank that sat on

279
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:40,640
 the border as well, half of it on one side, half on the other. So whenever a tax inspector came to

280
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:44,240
 the bank, they'd quickly grab all the paperwork and put it into the country that the person

281
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:51,520
 was not from to stop it. I did a music gig on the border close to my house. I live close to the

282
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:56,400
 border of Holland. I did a music gig on the border and we put the stage in Holland and the crowds

283
00:26:56,400 --> 00:27:04,320
 in Belgium. And then we waited for the copyright collector to come by. And he said, you have to

284
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:08,480
 pay. I said, no, music is in Holland. And I said, yeah, of course, but there's a crowd here. Yeah,

285
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:26,720
 they paid in Belgium. Wow, we didn't pay. That's genius. It is time for fact number three and that

286
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:33,600
 is James. Okay, my fact this week is that my brain is considerably smaller than it was when we started

287
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:39,680
 doing no such thing as a fish. Was that from hanging out with me so much? You think it would be

288
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:43,440
 bigger? You've learned a lot in the last nine years. Do you think that's how it works every

289
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:48,240
 time you learn something, it gets a little bit bigger, your brain? Well, I don't think that now

290
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:55,760
 I've said it in front of an audience. Yeah, so this is just basically two different things. One,

291
00:27:55,760 --> 00:28:03,120
 that your brain shrinks by 5% per decade after you turn 40. And I've turned 40 since we started.

292
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:08,160
 And secondly, according to a brand new study, the first time you become a father, you lose a

293
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:12,960
 couple of percentages of volume in your brain as well. And that's happened to me quite recently.

294
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:18,560
 And so yeah, just basically I'm a bit worried that my brain's disappearing. Do you lose intelligence

295
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:25,760
 or is it just size? Just size as far as we know. Although I do feel quite dumb now that I've had

296
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:32,240
 a baby. But yeah, I think the idea is no one really knows this, but the idea is that the brain's

297
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:36,800
 size itself is not that important, because the brain kind of sorts itself out. For instance,

298
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:42,160
 Einstein had a smaller than average brain, and he was quite smart actually. But many more connections.

299
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:47,840
 He had a lot more connections in his brain. And we noticed because his brain was stolen.

300
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:53,600
 They wanted to study his brain, and he was against it. He didn't want to do it. And a scientist took

301
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:59,760
 his brain away. After he died, we should say. Or shortly before it, one of the two.

302
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:06,400
 I've read this study that you were talking about, James, your brain shrinking when you

303
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:11,920
 become a father. Is it the idea is that some of the bits you lose are the visual system or bits

304
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:16,480
 connected to the visual system? And the idea is that it just basically changes your brain slightly.

305
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:20,960
 And some of the bits that help you in nurturing or whatever kind of grow in one way or whatever.

306
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:26,640
 And the age thing, it does shrink, but a lot of it does seem to be due to dehydration.

307
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:32,720
 It's just a little bit more shriveled than you were. You lose a little bit of water out of your

308
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:38,400
 brain. Well, do you know if you want to get that brain volume back, James? Oh, great. Something you

309
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:45,200
 can do. Please pray tell. Just become an astronaut. Oh, is that all? That's all. Astronauts have bigger

310
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:53,040
 brains than people. Astronauts, people. I mean, you know, they're not astronauts. So do they expand

311
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:59,360
 in space? Yeah, basically, because there's there's much less gravity or microgravity. So the fluid

312
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:03,600
 sort of builds up a bit and you get a bit more white matter, a bit more gray matter, a bit more

313
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:08,400
 spinal fluid, and your brain increases by 2%, which is about what you lose with first time

314
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:12,240
 fatherhood. Oh, right. So really, every time someone has a baby, we should send them into

315
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:18,080
 space, send them off to space. Brilliant. Have a break. It's such a male idea. Okay, honey, we had

316
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:24,320
 a baby. I have to go to space now. Goodbye. See you in six months. Sorry, I need some space. I need

317
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:34,400
 literally need some space. And so they're working on ways to solve this astronaut thing,

318
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:37,760
 because obviously all the fluid goes to the top of the body. And it could be a problem if your

319
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:42,240
 brain gets bigger. Well, one problem is that all astronauts get eye problems in space, your vision

320
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:46,640
 gets worse. And they think maybe the extra fluid is pressing on the optic nerve. So that's a problem.

321
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:50,240
 I know. So but there are methods being proposed to counteract this. They haven't been tried yet,

322
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:56,000
 but one is going in a little person sized centrifuge that spins you around a bit. And the other,

323
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:01,920
 my preferred option would be a kind of vacuum cleaner bag around the lower half of your body,

324
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:07,360
 which just gently sucks the fluid out of your top half and puts it back in your legs. No way.

325
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:13,120
 Really? What it kind of compresses you like compressions? Yeah, like sort of like laundry bags

326
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:18,560
 you just put for you. Brilliant. Yeah, there's a lot of animals that shrink their brain. Yeah,

327
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:23,360
 which is quite an amazing thing. And they do it to conserve energy during winter months,

328
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:28,800
 moles do it, the shrews do it. There's a whole sort of there's a whole study of science where

329
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:33,760
 they look at and then it can grow back, but it can go really because it's very, you know, a lot

330
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:38,240
 of your energy goes into your brain, doesn't it? Even if you're a shrew, it does. Yeah. And so, you

331
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:43,120
 know, if you need to save energy, that's a good thing to start shutting down. I think it's 20%

332
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:48,560
 20% of your energy is of everything we consume goes on energy for the brain. Yeah, it's pretty

333
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:54,320
 amazing. I quite like that when we go to sleep at night, there's a fluid which is called cerebrospinal

334
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:59,520
 fluid. When we sleep, that fluid sort of is like a car wash for our brain. It just kind of just

335
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:04,400
 gives it a little clean. Is this why you can wake up with this bits of foam dripping out of your

336
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:10,560
 mouth because of the washing going on at the brain? Yes. Yeah, yeah, the car wash. The soap is still

337
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:13,360
 yeah, yeah, not quite that. So is that what that does is washing your brain? Yeah, it's basically

338
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:18,320
 just cleansing it and just making it, yeah. Nice. Which is pretty sweet. Because your brain is in

339
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:25,200
 your, it's in your head and it's kind of. Great point, James. This is established. You know,

340
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:31,120
 you know, James, when you said your brain had shrunk, I didn't believe you. I'm coming round

341
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:35,520
 to this theory. I'm going to say of all the things I was going to say, I didn't think that would be

342
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:41,280
 the most controversial. No, it's like it's covered in fluid, isn't it? It's like, it's not really

343
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:46,720
 attached to anything. It's almost floating in this fluid in your brain, in your head. And for that

344
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:52,640
 reason, if you try and pick up a brain, you can't pick it up. It's like jelly like and it'll just kind

345
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:58,160
 of go through your fingers. And quite often if you see anyone picking up a brain, like a neuroscientist

346
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:02,720
 or whatever, then it's already been preserved in some way. If you actually literally, if I literally

347
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:07,280
 cut the top of your head off now and scooped out your brain, it would just fall through my fingers.

348
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:13,920
 Wow. I'm just another reason not to do that. Sorry, the first reason was.

349
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:21,280
 What's the last time you saw somebody pick up a bombed brain because you say it stays together

350
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:25,680
 when it's preserved? Yeah, I mean, I watched, spent a lot of time on YouTube, I don't know.

351
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:33,360
 Last time I saw it was yesterday. Oh, what? Life at this festival. No, what? We had a brain show.

352
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:37,760
 So we have theme shows and we had a brain show and there was a professor in anatomy and she had,

353
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:44,080
 she had brought a preserved brain, like a human brain. And she did the anatomy in front of 3,000

354
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:51,600
 people explaining what part is where. And then she explained that all the motoric functions,

355
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:56,480
 like when you move your arm and your fingers, if you start from the very top of your head,

356
00:33:56,480 --> 00:34:02,640
 and then you go down to your ear, you meet, I think it was first your legs and then your mouth

357
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:08,480
 and then your arm and then your fingers. How interesting. And then another scientist came

358
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:13,120
 on stage and said, do you want me to prove that the control of your fingers are right there?

359
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:21,360
 They put a magnetic coil on my head and they did transcranial magnetic stimulation.

360
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:26,240
 What does that mean? It means that so you have a big magnetic coil and it can send magnetic fields

361
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:32,160
 and of course our nerves send electric signals. So the first thing they did was let's first

362
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:38,080
 put electricity in the wiring, so in the nerves. Okay. He put this magnetic coil on my forearm,

363
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:42,720
 where the entire control nerves of your fingers are. Then he gave some pulses and my fingers

364
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:47,120
 started twitching. Without you wanting anything, they started twitching. I said, okay, that was

365
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:52,480
 boring. That was just the wiring. Let's mess with the computer now. And then he put the coil on my

366
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:57,520
 head and he was looking for what fingers to control and he could, so I was sitting there

367
00:34:57,520 --> 00:35:02,720
 with a coil on my head and I hear this clicking noise and first my arm started twitching and

368
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:06,320
 then he said, let's move to the fingers and then he went to the fingers and said, now I'm going to

369
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:11,200
 move from the thumb to the brain and so really it was first my thumb and then he was going down

370
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:17,440
 and then my fingers started twitching. My brain was hacked yesterday. Wow. Yeah. What use could we

371
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:24,880
 have for that? They do have a few. They do have a few. Yeah, but especially in some cases, like

372
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:30,800
 some depressions are a lack of brain activity and they are, it's experimental, but they're now

373
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:36,480
 looking if we kind of still... Can it teach me how to play piano? That's right. Oh yeah. It's going

374
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:44,960
 to be free jazz, but yes. Right. James, once you've got back from space, if you feel like you've got

375
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:49,200
 a brain that's too big and you want to get rid of a bit more, do you know something else you can do?

376
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:55,520
 Become a dad again? Maybe, maybe. I don't know, Andy. What can I do? Another one is running an

377
00:35:55,520 --> 00:36:00,000
 ultramarathon. Oh, really? So people who run ultramarathans, their brains shrink by up to six

378
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:05,520
 percent, which feels like quite a lot over the course of the race and it might, we're not exactly

379
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:10,400
 sure why. I think one theory is that you're just, you're looking at a road for however many days,

380
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:14,720
 if you do like a 10-day ultramarathon or a month or whatever, you're just looking at a road over

381
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:19,520
 and over again and your brain is under stimulated and just says, "I don't, I don't need to be here."

382
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:24,960
 I don't know, is it the silver side or is it the gold side? Do you know what animal has the smallest

383
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:30,720
 brain in comparison to the size of its body? Oh, was it dinosaurs? I think they had small

384
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:37,840
 brains. Ah, I'm more talking about extant animals. Okay. Is he on the panel now? You don't say anything?

385
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:44,160
 Oh, they can't see us at home. Don't talk about leaving like that.

386
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:52,480
 Oh, wow. Is it, yeah, some kind of bird, maybe a dinosaur relative? It's not a bird. It is a fish

387
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:59,840
 and it's a fish called the bony-eared ass fish. Okay. Is it so dumb it doesn't know we're insulting

388
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:06,000
 it? Is that the... No, it's it. It's brain weighs less than one one-thousandth of its body weight. Wow.

389
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:10,560
 And of all the animals that we've tried so far, this is the smallest compared to its size. The

390
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:15,360
 thing is it's got a really, really small brain, but it has massive sort of ear canals, so the ear

391
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:21,680
 canals can grow bigger because the brain isn't there, which means you might call it its name,

392
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:26,560
 and it might not understand it, but it will be able to hear it. We're going to have to move on,

393
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:33,200
 guys, for a final fact in a second. Okay. The the stickleback fish, the three-spine stickleback

394
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:39,760
 fish, the males have much bigger brains than the females, and this is really rare in the animal

395
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:49,680
 kingdom. Okay. I can already see that I need to tread very carefully with this one, but yeah,

396
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:55,120
 it's true, and we're not really sure why, but perhaps because the females gonads take up 40%

397
00:37:55,120 --> 00:38:01,360
 of her body mass, so maybe she's using up all the energy for reproduction, and the male doesn't

398
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:06,240
 need to do that, and so grows a big brain instead. But he used it for like a lot of

399
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:12,080
 distraction and deception and stuff. He's quite, the males are quite sneaky, and the females are

400
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:19,600
 just doing lots of reproducing, and that's why that. Why do the, wow. No, no, everyone's way too

401
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:25,120
 scared to make Eddie Jones know this. All right, hang on. Go on, Andy. Yeah, do it. It's on it. Get

402
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:34,800
 cancelled. Why do the males need to be sneaky? Because the males will often, they'll have a nest

403
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:39,440
 of eggs that they look after, and a lot of, sometimes a big group of females will come along

404
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:45,200
 and eat all the eggs because they want their offspring to do better than the other offspring,

405
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:50,320
 and so the males sometimes use sneaky tricks to pretend they're in one place looking after

406
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:53,200
 some eggs, and they're actually, their eggs are in another place. That's great. I thought it was

407
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:57,440
 sneakiness to try and persuade the females to mate, but it's actually to try and stop the females

408
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:02,240
 from eating the eggs of the things you've already made. Okay, okay, okay, nice. Nice. Well done for

409
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:05,200
 not getting cancelled. Yeah, no further questions, Your Honor.

410
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:16,480
 It is time for our final fact of the show, and that is my fact. My fact this week is that

411
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:22,800
 because the London offices of the Guinness World Records don't have a complete set of Guinness

412
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:29,040
 World Records books, whenever they need to find something out, they often need to consult the

413
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:34,800
 man who has the Guinness World Record for the owner of the most Guinness World Records books.

414
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:50,560
 This guy exists. His name is Martin Tovey, and he has thousands of unique Guinness Record books,

415
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:54,480
 because the Guinness World Records, when it started, it obviously started as this one annual,

416
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:59,680
 but over the years, they started doing books about sporting records, gaming records. There are

417
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:05,280
 thousands of these different types of books, and we all here on the panel, we know Craig Glenday,

418
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:09,520
 who is the editor-in-chief of the Guinness World Records, and I went to his office and I saw all

419
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:14,000
 of the books that they have, and he told me this point. He said that, you know, we often have to

420
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:19,440
 verify a fact if someone writes into us. If I don't have it, I just message Martin Tovey.

421
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:23,200
 That's brilliant. Yeah, and I say, what have you got? Can you get me? And he digs it out, and he

422
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:29,040
 usually has it. So the most recent time that Craig had to do it was because a porn actor in America

423
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:32,960
 was claiming that he was listed in the Guinness World Records, and Craig thought this can't be

424
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:37,680
 right. It's a family-friendly book. We're not going to be like, you know, biggest dick, I don't know.

425
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:44,480
 That is not in there, right? That record also belongs to a guy who got it stuck in a bottle

426
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:54,400
 with potassium. It's mostly bottle, but still. So he looked it up for Craig.

427
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:58,960
 Oh, because he said, I'm in, you know, 1974, and he had that one and could look it up.

428
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:03,920
 Yeah, I think, or either it was just, we're missing this one, and I've checked everything else,

429
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:07,680
 and so, yeah, and it turns out that the porn actor is lying. It's not in there.

430
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:14,160
 You know the adjudicators, the people who turn up to assess whether the record is broken or not?

431
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:18,240
 Okay, yeah, someone with a stopwatch. Yeah, they have a stopwatch and they have a blazer,

432
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:23,280
 that which they all have to wear, the official Guinness blazer, and they are like ninjas, okay?

433
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:28,400
 They're not allowed to eat or drink alcohol when they're with the record setters. Obviously,

434
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:37,040
 they are allowed to eat food. God, sorry. They're not allowed to socialize at all with the people

435
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:40,800
 trying to set the records. They have to keep their distance. And the other thing they do is,

436
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:46,960
 they make the certificate for your record before you even try it. They bring it along to the record

437
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:51,680
 breaking attempt, and if you don't succeed, they take it away with them, which is very cruel.

438
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:55,040
 That's not the cruelest thing. They don't rip it up in front of your face. They shred it.

439
00:41:55,040 --> 00:42:01,120
 Do they really? Because I don't think I shred it in front of the charity or the children who are

440
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:06,480
 trying to break a record for like most sausage dogs, but they do, they do shred it because

441
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:11,680
 sometimes people have gone through the bins afterwards, trying to steal the certificate,

442
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:17,680
 which they've thrown away. One of these people is here. Oh really? There's an official Guinness

443
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:22,960
 World Records book representative here, because the University of Brussels broke a record yesterday,

444
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:28,160
 like most built robots. The children here built small robots in a chain, and they had the longest

445
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:33,760
 chain of robots in a row, and they succeeded, so they will receive the certificate afterwards.

446
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:35,760
 That's amazing. Up your shredder.

447
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:46,400
 I was looking at a few other records that have been broken in the last week or so,

448
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:53,760
 so the largest t-shirt in the world, that was in Romania, and they made it out of 500,000

449
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:59,280
 recycled bottles. It's absolutely enormous. It's in the middle of a field, and they took it then

450
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:04,240
 apart afterwards, and they've turned it into 10,000 items of clothing that they're giving to

451
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:12,640
 young people who can't buy clothes elsewhere. The most bats ever in a cave was broken. That

452
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:18,800
 was in San Antonio. The number of bats in this cave, is it more or less than the population of

453
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:24,320
 Belgium? Oh my god. Well, let me tell you the population of Belgium, according to Wikipedia,

454
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:28,960
 is 11.5 million. I think more bats in a cave than people in Belgium. I'm going to have a

455
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:34,880
 pun. By a long way, or? I think double. Double the number. Well, it's 15 million. Wow. 15 million

456
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:40,080
 bats in this cave, and someone walked up to the cave, and as the bats came out. An adjudicator

457
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:49,280
 with a clicker. Yeah. Like a bouncer at a nightclub. And a shredder. Yeah, yeah, yeah. They said,

458
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:56,320
 they said that the bats sometimes will come out all at once, and it would make a cloud of bats,

459
00:43:56,320 --> 00:44:03,360
 which is 50 kilometers by 30 kilometers. Wow. That's insane, isn't it? That's so cool. And the

460
00:44:03,360 --> 00:44:10,240
 man with the world's longest nose died. Oh. He died last week. And his father, Gepetto, was said to

461
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:23,120
 be very sad. Such a shame. There's another record that I found, which is that there's a Guinness

462
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:29,040
 World Record for the most poisonous book ever. Oh. And it's called Shadows from the Wall of Death.

463
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:35,200
 It's from 1874, and it was written to warn the public about the dangers of arsenic-based dyes

464
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:40,880
 that are used in contemporary wallpaper manufacturers. And so he took 86 leafs of these

465
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:46,800
 things and bound them into one book. So it's the arsenic level in this book is off the chart. Oh my

466
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:52,000
 God. Yeah. Don't lick your fingers to turn the pages, right? Yeah, exactly. Yeah. And that was,

467
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:58,320
 you could buy that, could you? No, I think it was like a one-up. Yeah, an example. It's like the

468
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:03,840
 notebooks of Marie Curie, who are still kept away from people. They're still so radioactive that

469
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:08,400
 they're dangerous to interact with. So cool. Did you hear about the Irish guy who tried to beat

470
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:14,960
 the world record for longest live burial? No. This was cool. It was in 1968. He was called Mick Meany,

471
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:21,200
 and I think he did about two months. He did a long time underground, and he had, he lived on

472
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:27,120
 steak and cigarettes, which were fed to him through a tube. And then he had a hatch beneath him,

473
00:45:27,120 --> 00:45:32,000
 which he opened to go to the bathroom into. Oh, to sort of sort of pit beneath him. Sadly,

474
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:39,040
 he didn't invite an adjudicator. No. And so they couldn't give him the thing. That's not even a

475
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:45,120
 shredder then. No, they shredded him at the end. It was so sad. Guys, we're going to have to wrap

476
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:50,960
 up in a second. Yeah, we're the end of the show. But there's one thing about world records. There's

477
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:56,800
 one guy who owns the world records of world records. Oh, cool. Okay. So there's one person who has the

478
00:45:56,800 --> 00:46:04,240
 most world records, and then a mathematician heard this, and he said, this guy has an endless amount

479
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:11,040
 of world records, because he has the world records of most world records. This means he also has the

480
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:18,880
 world records of world records of most world records, which is one. He also has the world

481
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:23,600
 records of world records of world records of world records. And that's what mathematicians do. So

482
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:31,040
 he has an endless amount of world records. That's incredible. We're just, we're talking about like

483
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:35,920
 books, like collections of books and stuff like that. So I quickly looked at that. There was a

484
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:42,960
 Christopher Columbus's son, who was called Anando Colon. He invented the bookshelf. Oh, and the

485
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:48,160
 reason he did that is he wanted to read every book that existed in the whole world. Okay, and we

486
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:52,240
 reckon that when he was born, it might have been possible. Obviously he was a baby, so he couldn't

487
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:57,200
 read. But by the time he died, there was a massive amount of books being printed, and there's no way

488
00:46:57,200 --> 00:47:06,000
 he could have done it. And according to Google books, there are currently 129,864,880 books in the

489
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:13,440
 world. If you decided to read them all, you did one an hour, nine to five, sat next to Niagara Falls,

490
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:18,960
 then by the time you finished the last one, Niagara Falls would have ceased to exist due to erosion.

491
00:47:19,600 --> 00:47:25,760
 Wow. Better make it nine to six. Yeah, better, better crack on. Yeah.

492
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:37,520
 That is it. That is all of our facts. And if you'd like to get in contact with any of us about the

493
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:42,240
