00:00:00,00:00:03,"Hi everybody, Dan and Andy here. We're just letting you know about our special guest this week."
00:00:03,00:00:10,This is such a fun show. It was recorded live in Belgium at a festival called Nerdland.
00:00:10,00:00:15,And it's with one of our very oldest friends and one of the first ever guests we had on the show.
00:00:15,00:00:21,"Yeah, that's right. It is the almighty Belgian science comedian, Leven Skynra."
00:00:21,00:00:26,"Leven is someone who has been with us from the get-go. As Andy says, he's appeared a few times."
00:00:26,00:00:33,"He's brought us over to Belgium in the past and we got to go to his geek-created festival called Nerdland,"
00:00:33,00:00:38,"which was just packed with scientists from all over the country and for some reason, us."
00:00:38,00:00:45,And we played this massive tent. We had to fill our slot without Anna and Leven very kindly jumped into place
00:00:45,00:00:51,and played with us on stage and he's just someone who you absolutely need to find out more about.
00:00:51,00:00:58,"And in fact, his live show, which is called DNA, has been released on his website, Levenskynra.com,"
00:00:58,00:01:05,"as an English version of his science comedy show. And that's really worth checking out. It's online now, streaming."
00:01:05,00:01:11,"So, give that a go. And the other thing we should let you know is that if you enjoy this live show,"
00:01:11,00:01:16,"we have another live show coming up. There are very few tickets left for our Soho Theatre dates this summer,"
00:01:16,00:01:21,"but we have just added another live show, which is going to be at the London Podcast Festival."
00:01:21,00:01:28,"It's on the 14th of September. It's at 7pm. It's in London, obviously, but it's going to be streamed as well."
00:01:28,00:01:33,So you'll be able to buy tickets wherever you are in the world. It's going to be so much fun. We would love to see you there.
00:01:33,00:01:39,"That's right. Yeah. So get booking the physical in-store tickets, as they were, so you could be there with us in the room."
00:01:39,00:01:44,"But if you can't make it, do get the online tickets. And to get those tickets, all you need to do is go to"
00:01:44,00:01:50,nosuchthingasafish.com/podfest. You'll find the links there to buy the appropriate things.
00:01:50,00:01:56,"And otherwise, we hope you get a taster of what we're like live, nicely, with this episode,"
00:01:56,00:01:59,"with our good mate, Leaven Skyra, coming to you live from Belgium."
00:01:59,00:02:00,Hooray!
00:02:00,00:02:02,Come on with the show.
00:02:02,00:02:04,(Buzzing)
00:02:04,00:02:16,(Speaking in Japanese)
00:02:16,00:02:23,"Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast this week coming to you live"
00:02:23,00:02:27,from the Nerdland Festival in Belgium!
00:02:27,00:02:34,(Cheering)
00:02:34,00:02:41,My name is Dan Schreiber. I am sitting here with Andrew Hunt and Murray James Harkin and Leaven Skyra.
00:02:41,00:02:46,"And once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days."
00:02:46,00:02:53,"And in no particular order, here we go. Starting with fact number one, and that is Andy."
00:02:53,00:03:00,"My fact is that, in the 1970s, NASA employees had to walk around holding broomsticks in front of them"
00:03:00,00:03:03,to detect invisible fires.
00:03:03,00:03:04,Ooh. Yeah.
00:03:04,00:03:08,"I didn't even know that, in fact, now I'm worried about invisible fires."
00:03:08,00:03:09,You should be.
00:03:09,00:03:12,Because we don't have anyone with brooms here. How would we know that there wasn't one?
00:03:12,00:03:15,"We just wouldn't. So, you know, stay vigilant, I suppose."
00:03:15,00:03:21,"So, what were people noticing that it was only janitors who weren't going up in flames?"
00:03:21,00:03:25,"Yeah, I didn't know about invisible fires. Oh, I should say, this is a fact from Anna Welch,"
00:03:25,00:03:29,"who sent it in to us at the podcast email address. So, thank you so much, Anna."
00:03:29,00:03:36,"It's because NASA uses liquid hydrogen for lots of their rockets, and since the 1950s they've been using it."
00:03:36,00:03:40,And it's incredibly flammable. It's a great fuel for a rocket.
00:03:40,00:03:44,"It burns at 5,000 degrees Fahrenheit. It's ultra-explosive."
00:03:44,00:03:49,"But, of course, hydrogen, first atom, first element in the periodic table, it's tiny."
00:03:49,00:03:52,"The atoms are incredibly small, and it's very flammable."
00:03:52,00:03:59,"And because the atoms are so small, it leaks. It can leak, even if you've welded two plates of metal together,"
00:03:59,00:04:00,you can get hydrogen.
00:04:00,00:04:02,"Just like a little hole in the weld, and it'll just sneak through."
00:04:02,00:04:09,"Exactly. And because it's quite temperamental, a high-pressurized amount of hydrogen can easily become a fire."
00:04:09,00:04:14,"However, the flame burns with this incredibly pale blue flame. You almost can't see it."
00:04:14,00:04:19,"And so, this was a real problem. So, NASA employees, to detect if they had a hydrogen fire,"
00:04:19,00:04:22,"in the situation, had to walk around holding a broomstick."
00:04:22,00:04:29,"And when the head of the broom caught fire, they knew that that was the problem, basically."
00:04:29,00:04:30,And that's it. That's what they had to do.
00:04:30,00:04:32,I do hope there's video footage of this.
00:04:32,00:04:37,All these brilliant engineers with sticks just walking around.
00:04:37,00:04:39,"Have you heard of this leaving? Like, you do science?"
00:04:39,00:04:44,"No. No, I haven't heard of the broomstick story. I know that hydrogen fires are a thing."
00:04:44,00:04:48,"My father worked in a steel factory, so they also had hydrogen in pipes."
00:04:49,00:04:55,"And like you said, the smallest leakage, the hydrogen would come out, and it would ignite,"
00:04:55,00:05:00,"my dad told me, it would ignite from the heat of a piece of dust hitting the side of the pipe."
00:05:00,00:05:06,"That would be enough to ignite the hydrogen, and so then you have your invisible flame."
00:05:06,00:05:11,"That's incredible. Obviously, flame is a huge problem for NASA, generally."
00:05:11,00:05:14,"They hate fires. They're really not keen on fires, NASA."
00:05:14,00:05:17,"Unless it's at the very bottom of the rocket, shooting them up."
00:05:17,00:05:22,"That's the one time they like fires. Otherwise, it's a really bad thing."
00:05:22,00:05:26,"So back when they were trying to work out the Apollo missions and who was going to be flying to space,"
00:05:26,00:05:30,there was a guy who was hired as basically the fart researcher.
00:05:30,00:05:35,"And because there's methane in the farts, and if you're in a tin can going back to the moon,"
00:05:35,00:05:38,"it's going to catch on fire. So there was a guy called Edwin Murphy,"
00:05:38,00:05:43,"who at the 1964 conference of nutrition and space and related waste problems,"
00:05:43,00:05:47,pitched that we needed to find astronauts who didn't fart with methane.
00:05:47,00:05:53,"With methane, right? Does that exist? He found them. He's like, they're out there."
00:05:53,00:05:56,Is that Buzz and Neil Armstrong? They don't fart?
00:05:56,00:06:02,Because I've been in a lift with Buzz Aldrin. I can't say that he didn't fart.
00:06:02,00:06:09,The farts are produced by your gut bacteria. So the reason that some foods produce more
00:06:09,00:06:14,"fart is because they go all the way down in your gut, like things with lots of fibers,"
00:06:14,00:06:19,such as Brussels sprouts. And the fibers take food to the downside of your gut.
00:06:19,00:06:25,"And so the bacteria eat them and produce this methane. And when you can't digest lactose,"
00:06:25,00:06:30,"then it will also find all its way down. So in order to fart, you have to feed your bacteria"
00:06:30,00:06:36,"all the way down. But not all of us have bacteria that produce methane. I, however,"
00:06:36,00:06:42,do because I was tested. Were you? Yes. We had a science show. What's the test?
00:06:42,00:06:48,"It's not just, it's not a lighter, is it? I can, I can leave it up to your imagination,"
00:06:48,00:06:53,but you can test it with a lighter because you can actually light it at the source.
00:06:53,00:07:00,"So, yeah. But if you produce this methane in your gut, it will end up in your blood and in your"
00:07:00,00:07:04,breath. So I simply took a breath test and then they saw I had methane. The reason we did this
00:07:04,00:07:13,"was because we found an old patent of a fart gun. And so what? Yes, the fart gun. This is a toy gun."
00:07:13,00:07:19,Yeah. And you put a dart in it. Yeah. And then it has a small chamber. When you feel a fart coming
00:07:19,00:07:25,"up, you press the chamber against your butt. While you fart, you pull the lever, it fills"
00:07:25,00:07:29,up with methane. You pull the trigger and the dart flies out. Which way is the dart flying?
00:07:30,00:07:36,"Whatever direction you prefer, Mr. Schweiger. That is amazing. I think I did it wrong."
00:07:36,00:07:40,"That's a patent. They've never made one of those, have they? They have been produced"
00:07:40,00:07:47,"and we have reproduced them with a 3D printer. And after many attempts, over 50 attempts,"
00:07:47,00:07:52,"one dart flew through the room. That's incorrect. Wow, really. Yeah. So it's about 50% of people"
00:07:52,00:07:57,who don't have methane in their farts. And he created a special bean meal whereby he had you
00:07:57,00:08:02,eat it and then you farted into a sort of rectal catheter and it collected the farts. Brilliant.
00:08:02,00:08:06,"And he pitched it and they said, ""We'll just give them less farty food in space."""
00:08:06,00:08:12,Spoils spots. Yeah. Okay. This is another fact sent in actually by someone called Don Padden.
00:08:12,00:08:18,And it's a memoir of NASA in the 1960s. And he wrote a memoir of what had happened in his life.
00:08:18,00:08:22,"And one incident, a terrible incident that happened at NASA was an accidental activation"
00:08:22,00:08:29,"of the launch tower water deluge system. So, you know, huge, like a massive sprinkler system"
00:08:29,00:08:33,basically designed to just shut down any disastrous fire that might be happening.
00:08:33,00:08:40,And it was an area gas hydrogen detector. So the problem was it wasn't a hydrogen leak that had
00:08:40,00:08:44,"caused this system to go off this deluge. The cause was, and he wrote up in his report in his"
00:08:44,00:08:52,"memoir, ""Gasious emissions of robust Chrysler senior engineer."" What? He had been up working,"
00:08:52,00:08:56,like fixing an engineering problem on the hydrogen tank and farting at the time.
00:08:56,00:09:01,And they didn't know until this point that the detector could smell human farts. They thought
00:09:01,00:09:07,"it was just a hydrogen leak detector, but it turned out... That's amazing. Oh my God. Millions of"
00:09:07,00:09:14,"dollars of damage. Yeah. Leeman, I want you to imagine now you're on Apollo 11 making your way"
00:09:14,00:09:18,up to the moon. And I have one question for you. Would you like still or sparkling water?
00:09:18,00:09:26,"Oh, I think I would like still water. Well, you can't. The reason being that on Apollo 11,"
00:09:26,00:09:31,there was a hydrogen filter on the water and it leaked. And it meant that hydrogen got into the
00:09:31,00:09:37,"water. And so all the water was fizzy. Wait away. But water already contains hydrogen. Yes, it does,"
00:09:37,00:09:42,but this had super amount of hydrogen in it. So they had sparkling water on the moon.
00:09:42,00:09:46,"It had sparkling water. That's nice. That's really, that's very posh. You want to celebrate,"
00:09:46,00:09:52,don't you? You do. Yeah. I think we're two-thirds of all the atoms in all of our bodies are hydrogen.
00:09:52,00:09:55,"It's all right. A little shout out for hydrogen. Yeah, it's very important. But why are we not"
00:09:55,00:10:00,setting on fire all the time? Why are we not exploding? Because they're bound to a molecule.
00:10:00,00:10:05,I wanted to add the torch to that one. And I'm thrilled that you answered it.
00:10:05,00:10:11,"You were just about to say that, I guess. Probably. I was looking into other invisible"
00:10:11,00:10:15,"things at NASA. And I found this really cool website, which is called NASA Spinoff, where they're"
00:10:15,00:10:21,quite proud that a thing that was invented for NASA and space is now an everyday object in our
00:10:21,00:10:25,"world. So on the list of things that they have, there was a company in conjunction with NASA's"
00:10:25,00:10:30,Advanced Ceramics Research. They were trying to use protection for infrared antennae on heat-seeking
00:10:30,00:10:35,missile trackers. That was one of their things they were doing. That technology is now invisible
00:10:35,00:10:40,braces that people have on their teeth. That was originally for a heat-seeking missile. And
00:10:40,00:10:46,"then they were like, ""Oh, we should put this on people's faces as well."" They did scratch-resistant"
00:10:46,00:10:51,lenses. Very proud of that. The space blanket. What's the space blanket? It's basically a
00:10:51,00:10:56,"lightweight and reflect infrared radiation. Is it not that thing after you've run a marathon,"
00:10:56,00:11:02,"they put it around you? Exactly. Yes, the gold side and the silver side. And one side has to be"
00:11:02,00:11:06,on the outside when you're overheated. And the other side has to be on the outside when you're
00:11:06,00:11:12,"too cold. Is that so? Yeah. I think when you're too cold, I think the gold side has to be on the"
00:11:12,00:11:18,"inside. And when you're too hot, I think the gold side has to be on the outside. Could be the exact"
00:11:18,00:11:26,other way around. I do not take legal responsibility. So there was this big piece of this around
00:11:26,00:11:35,"Apollo 11. And one millimeter, one square millimeter of this material is now at my desk."
00:11:35,00:11:42,I have bought one square millimeter of this material that has been on the moon.
00:11:42,00:11:44,That's what happens when they go back and they find they're missing.
00:11:44,00:11:53,Then hydrogen leaks out. Three astronauts died today because of a Belgian comedian scientist.
00:11:54,00:11:58,"One last thing, so memory foam mattress was also a NASA invention. And then my favorite,"
00:11:58,00:12:05,"space age swimsuits. They invented a swimsuit. I don't know why. There's no water in space,"
00:12:05,00:12:10,at least not in the ISS so far. But they built it. And it's been used now by various different
00:12:10,00:12:15,companies in order to turn it into actual swimsuits. But what does it do? It just makes you
00:12:15,00:12:22,"swim in space, I guess. What? It's just really fine material. And the materials used in actual"
00:12:22,00:12:27,"human earth swimming now. And the first time it was used in 2008, there were 13 swimming records"
00:12:27,00:12:33,"that were broken immediately. Oh, really? Is it the one they got banned? The laser, the laser"
00:12:33,00:12:41,"suits. Yeah, that was kind of based on like a shark skin, wasn't it? And also it kind of made you"
00:12:41,00:12:46,"float in the water, which they thought probably wasn't fair. How can you break so many records?"
00:12:46,00:12:51,"I mean, they're such small, small swimsuits. How can that make that much of a difference in the"
00:12:51,00:12:56,"whole body with their full body swimsuits? Oh, I'm thinking of the, yeah. I don't know if you've"
00:12:56,00:13:01,"ever watched the Olympic swimming. They're not in bikinis. You're going to be staggered to hear,"
00:13:01,00:13:06,James. I've never seen any swimming competition ever. But here's what's crazy. You're saying that
00:13:06,00:13:11,you've got that little bit of the gold from the Apollo 11. James and I have seen the little patch
00:13:11,00:13:17,"that's missing from the shark that was taken by, I believe it was Adidas at Nike to make this"
00:13:17,00:13:20,"material. It was at the Natural History Museum in Montana. Wait, do you mean a piece of actual"
00:13:20,00:13:25,shark skin? They have the shark where it's missing the patch that then is turned into the swimsuit
00:13:25,00:13:29,that was donated from the museum. Yeah. We're going to have to move on to our next fact in a second.
00:13:29,00:13:36,"Okay. Just on hydrogen, do you know what happens if you have some potassium and you get water on it?"
00:13:36,00:13:43,"It's a big boom. Yeah, a big boom, like a big explosion. Loads of hydrogen get shot out. And"
00:13:43,00:13:51,"there was a in 1849, doctors turned up at a man's house and they found that his penis was stuck in"
00:13:51,00:13:59,a bottle. And the bottle opening was only 1.9 centimeters in diameter. Okay. And what he'd
00:13:59,00:14:02,been doing was he'd been doing some experiments with potassium. I was just trying to get the ship
00:14:02,00:14:10,out of the bottle. My finger wasn't quite managing to do the job. He was doing some experiments with
00:14:10,00:14:15,potassium. And he woke up in the middle of the night and decided that he needed to have a pee.
00:14:15,00:14:20,"And went to pee in a bottle, which happened to be the thing that he'd been doing his potassium"
00:14:20,00:14:26,experiments in. The urine reacted with the potassium. There was a massive explosion. All the
00:14:26,00:14:38,"hydrogen left the bottle, leaving a vacuum that sucked his penis. I think you're starting a new fetish"
00:14:38,00:14:47,here. Penis in a bottle. I'd buy one. You tried potassium. Yeah. Can you imagine him calling
00:14:47,00:14:56,"the doctors going, what am I going to say? Hi. Oh, man. I got one more invisible story. Okay. Yeah."
00:14:56,00:15:01,"It was, I think it was in Spain. It was this region where a chameleon had lived. And then"
00:15:01,00:15:05,"suddenly they saw like, oh, it's nature is having a hard time. And suddenly they saw like, okay,"
00:15:05,00:15:12,"this chameleon went extinct. A few years later, they said, oh, they didn't just didn't see them."
00:15:12,00:15:19,So they actually rediscovered this chameleon that was extinct because their camouflage was so good.
00:15:19,00:15:31,"Brilliant. I love it. All right, we need to move on to our second fact. It is time for fact number"
00:15:31,00:15:38,"two. And that is leaving. My fact is that in 2015, it was discovered that only one person alive"
00:15:38,00:15:55,understands the Belgian tax system. I think that went down a lot better here than it might
00:15:55,00:16:03,have done in London. Probably. We're so proud of the faults in our country. So this is an article
00:16:03,00:16:10,"from the dead, which is our financial newspaper. And Belgium is, it's a complex country. And we"
00:16:10,00:16:16,have to divide taxes. We have the federal government for the entire country. Then we have three regions.
00:16:16,00:16:21,Flanders is the Dutch speaking north. Bologna is the French speaking south. And then we have
00:16:21,00:16:25,"Brussels, which is an independent region, and it's bilingual. There's a small part of Wallonia"
00:16:25,00:16:31,that speaks German. They have their own government. The French speaking people in Brussels and
00:16:31,00:16:37,"Wallonia have their own government also. So we have, let's see, three governments for the regions,"
00:16:37,00:16:42,"two or three for the languages, and then one federal government. Sorry, Leven, can I just ask,"
00:16:42,00:16:47,are you the one person who understands this? And you're explaining it to us now. This is
00:16:47,00:16:54,"just setting the scene. We pay our taxes to Belgium, the Federation, but then they have to"
00:16:54,00:17:00,"give some money to the regions because they have their responsibility. Education is for the regions,"
00:17:00,00:17:05,"but then, of course, the army is for the Federation. The Flemish coast, so the beach"
00:17:05,00:17:12,is Flanders. The North Sea is Belgium. So if you want to clean...
00:17:13,00:17:18,Why? So when does one become... Yeah. When are you leaving Flanders and entering Belgium?
00:17:18,00:17:24,"The moment you step in the sea, then you're in Belgium. And when the tide comes in,"
00:17:24,00:17:36,"is that counted as an invasion? Yeah, well, probably. That's why we build sand castles to keep Flanders."
00:17:40,00:17:45,"But so if you want to clean the beach, you need Flemish money. If you want to clean the sea,"
00:17:45,00:17:51,you need federal money. The result is that there's a constant lobbying of how much money goes to the
00:17:51,00:17:58,"regions a bit more, a bit less. You have all kinds of factors. Some of the factors are how many people"
00:17:58,00:18:04,"are in school. So not the complete population, but people in school. How many people are retired?"
00:18:04,00:18:10,"No, yeah, because that's also an extra cost. And so they're always playing like, if we move the"
00:18:10,00:18:16,"factors around, then we get a bit more money, things like that. In 2015, the Flemish government"
00:18:16,00:18:20,"and the Walloon government get a letter from the tax administration, the federal tax administration,"
00:18:20,00:18:28,"they said, ""We did the miscalculation. We need 750 million euros back."" And so, of course,"
00:18:28,00:18:36,"these governments of the regions said, ""Okay, we'd like a second opinion."" And the tax, the federal"
00:18:36,00:18:43,"tax system said, ""There is no second opinion. Only Karin understands this problem."""
00:18:43,00:18:54,"So, can I ask, even so, this person now feels like the most important person in the entirety of"
00:18:54,00:19:02,"Belgium? So, is she on the armed guard? Well, Karin Spinwa, she was contacted by the press and she"
00:19:02,00:19:07,wants nothing to do with the press. She's a numbers person. She's a mathematician. She's very good
00:19:07,00:19:13,"with numbers. She makes the excel sheets. She's sitting at home counting her 750 million euros,"
00:19:13,00:19:20,"I think. Well, you do understand the Belgian psyche. Very good. But she says no photos of her"
00:19:20,00:19:26,online. We know virtually nothing about her. No. I have met a person who has met her.
00:19:26,00:19:32,"And so, at that point, it was published in this newspaper. They said, ""Only one person understands"
00:19:32,00:19:38,"this."" And then they said, ""What if something happens to her?"" And they panicked and they"
00:19:38,00:19:46,immediately gave her an assistant. So now there's two. We have a spare one. That's nice. And they're
00:19:46,00:19:50,not allowed to travel together and this kind of thing. There are loads of people like that.
00:19:50,00:19:56,"The Wright brothers, they weren't allowed to fly together. I think like members of the"
00:19:56,00:20:00,British royal family. I don't know. Is that true that they're not allowed to? Supposedly. I keep
00:20:00,00:20:05,saying to you guys that the people who do the parachutes that bring capsules back in from space
00:20:05,00:20:10,are not allowed to travel with each other because they hand knit. What do you do for a parachute
00:20:10,00:20:17,"stitch? So, yeah. And only a few people know how to do it is the rumor. Andy, you always say"
00:20:17,00:20:22,"whenever we're going to a gig that you don't want to travel in the same carriage as us. Weirdly,"
00:20:22,00:20:31,"that's nothing to do with this. Oh. So just a personality problem of mine. So Leven, why not?"
00:20:31,00:20:37,"So they're teaching the assistant. Why not teach, you know, three people? Why not? Don't be ridiculous."
00:20:37,00:20:45,"There isn't the budget for that. Well, probably a bit more people know this now. I haven't followed"
00:20:45,00:20:52,"the story since 2015. Also, there's probably a few people in academia who understand this too,"
00:20:52,00:20:57,but they're not allowed to do official calculations. So they could only ask this one person and now
00:20:57,00:21:02,there's two and hopefully a bit more by now. Wow. I was looking at a few other taxes. Did you hear
00:21:02,00:21:09,"about the bachelor tax of Argentina? No. Okay. This was in about 1900. Basically, I think there were"
00:21:09,00:21:14,"tax breaks or tax relief if you were married. But there was a problem, of course, which is what do"
00:21:14,00:21:19,"you do with men who wanted to get married and have proposed to a woman, but they've been rejected."
00:21:19,00:21:24,"You know, it's not their fault they're not married. They want to be married. They deserve some kind of"
00:21:24,00:21:29,"break on the tax. The system developed where they said, okay, well, if you've, fine, if you've proposed"
00:21:29,00:21:32,"to someone who've been rejected, you can have the tax break. Well, how do you prove that? How do you"
00:21:32,00:21:37,"prove it? So basically, if a woman said no when you propose marriage, you could then say, will you"
00:21:37,00:21:46,least sign this certificate of tax exemption for me? But then people started getting around the
00:21:46,00:21:50,"problem, like men who didn't want to get married. They thought, well, I want this tax break too."
00:21:50,00:21:57,So there emerged this small class of professional women who would guarantee say no to you when you
00:21:57,00:22:02,"propose marriage to them. I've met all of them in my teenage years, I must say. I have to think"
00:22:02,00:22:08,"about the British tax system, which is sounds quite simple. I mean, relative to the Belgian tax"
00:22:08,00:22:13,"system, it sounds relatively simple. But nonetheless, people in the UK, they're often late with their"
00:22:13,00:22:22,"taxes. And every year, HMRC, the British tax office, they will, they accept some excuses, you know,"
00:22:22,00:22:27,"if there was a flood or a sudden illness, you know, they'll say, okay, you don't have to pay a fine"
00:22:27,00:22:32,"because your taxes late. But also every year, they print the best excuses they've had."
00:22:32,00:22:41,"All year. So okay, these are all from the last few years. Okay, my tax return was on my yacht,"
00:22:41,00:22:47,"which caught fire. And by the way, I want to claim against the loss of a yacht."
00:22:47,00:22:52,"My wife helps me with my tax return, but she had a headache for 10 days."
00:22:53,00:22:56,My husband left me and took our accountant with him.
00:22:56,00:23:05,"My ex-wife left my tax return upstairs, but I suffer from vertigo and can't go upstairs to"
00:23:05,00:23:13,"retrieve it. And my favorite, I was too stunned after seeing a volcanic eruption on TV to concentrate"
00:23:13,00:23:21,"on anything. Brilliant. That's a good one. I've got a British tax story too. Yeah, it's the fact"
00:23:21,00:23:29,"that in 1999, at a UK court because of taxes, it was decided that Jaffa cakes are cakes and not"
00:23:29,00:23:35,"cookies. Okay. So Jaffa cakes for those who do not know it. In Belgium, we call it pimps cookies,"
00:23:35,00:23:45,"pimps cakes. Sorry, what did you call it? Pimps cookies? Yeah. Yeah. This is the Shire and we are"
00:23:45,00:23:51,"not offensive Europe. So that's, that's what we do. So for those who do not know whether you have"
00:23:51,00:23:58,"this spongy, spongy cake, a small circle, maybe five centimeters diameter, then there's a bit of"
00:23:58,00:24:06,orange jam and then there's a chocolate above it. So turns out that cookies with chocolate have
00:24:06,00:24:12,higher taxes than cake because cookies with chocolate are a luxury product and a cake is
00:24:12,00:24:18,"considered a staple food. So Jaffa cake said, we're selling cake, so we don't have to pay the VAT."
00:24:18,00:24:22,"And then the court said, no, these are clearly cookies. And they said, let's take it to court."
00:24:22,00:24:29,"And so they had an actual case, cookies against cake. Some of the arguments that were given,"
00:24:29,00:24:35,"one argument from the government, from the tax system was, we do not eat Jaffa cakes with forks."
00:24:36,00:24:44,"Oh, disagree. Yeah. Well, yeah. Also the size, the fact that you don't stack cakes on top of each"
00:24:44,00:24:51,"other. The argument was won by the cakes. So by the cookie producer, they are still cakes legally"
00:24:51,00:24:57,because one of the deciding arguments was that Jaffa cakes will harden when they go stale and
00:24:57,00:25:06,biscuits will go soggy. Okay. And the ultimate argument was somebody baked a cake size Jaffa cake.
00:25:06,00:25:11,"Brilliant. So they came to the courtroom with a cake sized Jaffa cake. I said, she told you."
00:25:11,00:25:17,And then it was decided. Wow. That's incredible. Why doesn't John Grisham write novels with these
00:25:17,00:25:24,"plot lines for his court cases? I wanted to ask you about a thing that happens here in Belgium,"
00:25:24,00:25:27,which is there's a place which I'm going to pronounce it wrong. Maybe you can say it.
00:25:31,00:25:36,"Everybody here knows what we're talking about. It sounds fascinating, guys. It sounds incredible."
00:25:36,00:25:41,"I've been there. It's where the two countries border. Yeah. Yeah. As a result, it's really"
00:25:41,00:25:46,odd because you can make decisions that work to your advantage in so many different places. I don't
00:25:46,00:25:52,"know if anyone's been there when they were younger, but the laws of drinking have different ages. So"
00:25:52,00:25:57,"in one country, it's 18. The other 16. So also firing a fart capsule is a criminal offense in"
00:25:57,00:26:03,"Balahertog, but it's not a Balnasa. So that's when Belgium and the Netherlands were split."
00:26:03,00:26:09,"There were some landowners like nobility who lived in Holland, like a few kilometers in Holland,"
00:26:09,00:26:14,"but they wanted to be Belgian because they were well, they had they had liaisons with the Belgian"
00:26:14,00:26:21,"royalty. And so they said, all my land is Belgian. But like a farmer, they had a peaceful and they're"
00:26:21,00:26:25,a piece of land. They're a piece of land there. So it looks like this ripped off piece of paper
00:26:25,00:26:29,that was sprinkled over Holland. So there's a piece of Belgium in Holland and in this piece
00:26:29,00:26:35,"of Belgium, there's a piece of Holland. So that's the thing that we used to be a bank that sat on"
00:26:35,00:26:40,"the border as well, half of it on one side, half on the other. So whenever a tax inspector came to"
00:26:40,00:26:44,"the bank, they'd quickly grab all the paperwork and put it into the country that the person"
00:26:44,00:26:51,was not from to stop it. I did a music gig on the border close to my house. I live close to the
00:26:51,00:26:56,border of Holland. I did a music gig on the border and we put the stage in Holland and the crowds
00:26:56,00:27:04,"in Belgium. And then we waited for the copyright collector to come by. And he said, you have to"
00:27:04,00:27:08,"pay. I said, no, music is in Holland. And I said, yeah, of course, but there's a crowd here. Yeah,"
00:27:08,00:27:26,"they paid in Belgium. Wow, we didn't pay. That's genius. It is time for fact number three and that"
00:27:26,00:27:33,"is James. Okay, my fact this week is that my brain is considerably smaller than it was when we started"
00:27:33,00:27:39,doing no such thing as a fish. Was that from hanging out with me so much? You think it would be
00:27:39,00:27:43,bigger? You've learned a lot in the last nine years. Do you think that's how it works every
00:27:43,00:27:48,"time you learn something, it gets a little bit bigger, your brain? Well, I don't think that now"
00:27:48,00:27:55,"I've said it in front of an audience. Yeah, so this is just basically two different things. One,"
00:27:55,00:28:03,that your brain shrinks by 5% per decade after you turn 40. And I've turned 40 since we started.
00:28:03,00:28:08,"And secondly, according to a brand new study, the first time you become a father, you lose a"
00:28:08,00:28:12,couple of percentages of volume in your brain as well. And that's happened to me quite recently.
00:28:12,00:28:18,"And so yeah, just basically I'm a bit worried that my brain's disappearing. Do you lose intelligence"
00:28:18,00:28:25,or is it just size? Just size as far as we know. Although I do feel quite dumb now that I've had
00:28:25,00:28:32,"a baby. But yeah, I think the idea is no one really knows this, but the idea is that the brain's"
00:28:32,00:28:36,"size itself is not that important, because the brain kind of sorts itself out. For instance,"
00:28:36,00:28:42,"Einstein had a smaller than average brain, and he was quite smart actually. But many more connections."
00:28:42,00:28:47,He had a lot more connections in his brain. And we noticed because his brain was stolen.
00:28:47,00:28:53,"They wanted to study his brain, and he was against it. He didn't want to do it. And a scientist took"
00:28:53,00:28:59,"his brain away. After he died, we should say. Or shortly before it, one of the two."
00:29:01,00:29:06,"I've read this study that you were talking about, James, your brain shrinking when you"
00:29:06,00:29:11,become a father. Is it the idea is that some of the bits you lose are the visual system or bits
00:29:11,00:29:16,connected to the visual system? And the idea is that it just basically changes your brain slightly.
00:29:16,00:29:20,And some of the bits that help you in nurturing or whatever kind of grow in one way or whatever.
00:29:20,00:29:26,"And the age thing, it does shrink, but a lot of it does seem to be due to dehydration."
00:29:27,00:29:32,It's just a little bit more shriveled than you were. You lose a little bit of water out of your
00:29:32,00:29:38,"brain. Well, do you know if you want to get that brain volume back, James? Oh, great. Something you"
00:29:38,00:29:45,"can do. Please pray tell. Just become an astronaut. Oh, is that all? That's all. Astronauts have bigger"
00:29:45,00:29:53,"brains than people. Astronauts, people. I mean, you know, they're not astronauts. So do they expand"
00:29:53,00:29:59,"in space? Yeah, basically, because there's there's much less gravity or microgravity. So the fluid"
00:29:59,00:30:03,"sort of builds up a bit and you get a bit more white matter, a bit more gray matter, a bit more"
00:30:03,00:30:08,"spinal fluid, and your brain increases by 2%, which is about what you lose with first time"
00:30:08,00:30:12,"fatherhood. Oh, right. So really, every time someone has a baby, we should send them into"
00:30:12,00:30:18,"space, send them off to space. Brilliant. Have a break. It's such a male idea. Okay, honey, we had"
00:30:18,00:30:24,"a baby. I have to go to space now. Goodbye. See you in six months. Sorry, I need some space. I need"
00:30:24,00:30:34,"literally need some space. And so they're working on ways to solve this astronaut thing,"
00:30:34,00:30:37,because obviously all the fluid goes to the top of the body. And it could be a problem if your
00:30:37,00:30:42,"brain gets bigger. Well, one problem is that all astronauts get eye problems in space, your vision"
00:30:42,00:30:46,gets worse. And they think maybe the extra fluid is pressing on the optic nerve. So that's a problem.
00:30:46,00:30:50,"I know. So but there are methods being proposed to counteract this. They haven't been tried yet,"
00:30:50,00:30:56,"but one is going in a little person sized centrifuge that spins you around a bit. And the other,"
00:30:56,00:31:01,"my preferred option would be a kind of vacuum cleaner bag around the lower half of your body,"
00:31:01,00:31:07,which just gently sucks the fluid out of your top half and puts it back in your legs. No way.
00:31:07,00:31:13,"Really? What it kind of compresses you like compressions? Yeah, like sort of like laundry bags"
00:31:13,00:31:18,"you just put for you. Brilliant. Yeah, there's a lot of animals that shrink their brain. Yeah,"
00:31:18,00:31:23,"which is quite an amazing thing. And they do it to conserve energy during winter months,"
00:31:23,00:31:28,"moles do it, the shrews do it. There's a whole sort of there's a whole study of science where"
00:31:28,00:31:33,"they look at and then it can grow back, but it can go really because it's very, you know, a lot"
00:31:33,00:31:38,"of your energy goes into your brain, doesn't it? Even if you're a shrew, it does. Yeah. And so, you"
00:31:38,00:31:43,"know, if you need to save energy, that's a good thing to start shutting down. I think it's 20%"
00:31:43,00:31:48,"20% of your energy is of everything we consume goes on energy for the brain. Yeah, it's pretty"
00:31:48,00:31:54,"amazing. I quite like that when we go to sleep at night, there's a fluid which is called cerebrospinal"
00:31:54,00:31:59,"fluid. When we sleep, that fluid sort of is like a car wash for our brain. It just kind of just"
00:31:59,00:32:04,gives it a little clean. Is this why you can wake up with this bits of foam dripping out of your
00:32:04,00:32:10,"mouth because of the washing going on at the brain? Yes. Yeah, yeah, the car wash. The soap is still"
00:32:10,00:32:13,"yeah, yeah, not quite that. So is that what that does is washing your brain? Yeah, it's basically"
00:32:13,00:32:18,"just cleansing it and just making it, yeah. Nice. Which is pretty sweet. Because your brain is in"
00:32:18,00:32:25,"your, it's in your head and it's kind of. Great point, James. This is established. You know,"
00:32:25,00:32:31,"you know, James, when you said your brain had shrunk, I didn't believe you. I'm coming round"
00:32:31,00:32:35,"to this theory. I'm going to say of all the things I was going to say, I didn't think that would be"
00:32:35,00:32:41,"the most controversial. No, it's like it's covered in fluid, isn't it? It's like, it's not really"
00:32:41,00:32:46,"attached to anything. It's almost floating in this fluid in your brain, in your head. And for that"
00:32:46,00:32:52,"reason, if you try and pick up a brain, you can't pick it up. It's like jelly like and it'll just kind"
00:32:52,00:32:58,"of go through your fingers. And quite often if you see anyone picking up a brain, like a neuroscientist"
00:32:58,00:33:02,"or whatever, then it's already been preserved in some way. If you actually literally, if I literally"
00:33:02,00:33:07,"cut the top of your head off now and scooped out your brain, it would just fall through my fingers."
00:33:07,00:33:13,"Wow. I'm just another reason not to do that. Sorry, the first reason was."
00:33:13,00:33:21,What's the last time you saw somebody pick up a bombed brain because you say it stays together
00:33:21,00:33:25,"when it's preserved? Yeah, I mean, I watched, spent a lot of time on YouTube, I don't know."
00:33:26,00:33:33,"Last time I saw it was yesterday. Oh, what? Life at this festival. No, what? We had a brain show."
00:33:33,00:33:37,"So we have theme shows and we had a brain show and there was a professor in anatomy and she had,"
00:33:37,00:33:44,"she had brought a preserved brain, like a human brain. And she did the anatomy in front of 3,000"
00:33:44,00:33:51,"people explaining what part is where. And then she explained that all the motoric functions,"
00:33:51,00:33:56,"like when you move your arm and your fingers, if you start from the very top of your head,"
00:33:56,00:34:02,"and then you go down to your ear, you meet, I think it was first your legs and then your mouth"
00:34:02,00:34:08,and then your arm and then your fingers. How interesting. And then another scientist came
00:34:08,00:34:13,"on stage and said, do you want me to prove that the control of your fingers are right there?"
00:34:13,00:34:21,They put a magnetic coil on my head and they did transcranial magnetic stimulation.
00:34:21,00:34:26,What does that mean? It means that so you have a big magnetic coil and it can send magnetic fields
00:34:26,00:34:32,and of course our nerves send electric signals. So the first thing they did was let's first
00:34:32,00:34:38,"put electricity in the wiring, so in the nerves. Okay. He put this magnetic coil on my forearm,"
00:34:38,00:34:42,where the entire control nerves of your fingers are. Then he gave some pulses and my fingers
00:34:42,00:34:47,"started twitching. Without you wanting anything, they started twitching. I said, okay, that was"
00:34:47,00:34:52,boring. That was just the wiring. Let's mess with the computer now. And then he put the coil on my
00:34:52,00:34:57,"head and he was looking for what fingers to control and he could, so I was sitting there"
00:34:57,00:35:02,with a coil on my head and I hear this clicking noise and first my arm started twitching and
00:35:02,00:35:06,"then he said, let's move to the fingers and then he went to the fingers and said, now I'm going to"
00:35:06,00:35:11,move from the thumb to the brain and so really it was first my thumb and then he was going down
00:35:11,00:35:17,and then my fingers started twitching. My brain was hacked yesterday. Wow. Yeah. What use could we
00:35:17,00:35:24,"have for that? They do have a few. They do have a few. Yeah, but especially in some cases, like"
00:35:24,00:35:30,"some depressions are a lack of brain activity and they are, it's experimental, but they're now"
00:35:30,00:35:36,looking if we kind of still... Can it teach me how to play piano? That's right. Oh yeah. It's going
00:35:36,00:35:44,"to be free jazz, but yes. Right. James, once you've got back from space, if you feel like you've got"
00:35:44,00:35:49,"a brain that's too big and you want to get rid of a bit more, do you know something else you can do?"
00:35:49,00:35:55,"Become a dad again? Maybe, maybe. I don't know, Andy. What can I do? Another one is running an"
00:35:55,00:36:00,"ultramarathon. Oh, really? So people who run ultramarathans, their brains shrink by up to six"
00:36:00,00:36:05,"percent, which feels like quite a lot over the course of the race and it might, we're not exactly"
00:36:05,00:36:10,"sure why. I think one theory is that you're just, you're looking at a road for however many days,"
00:36:10,00:36:14,"if you do like a 10-day ultramarathon or a month or whatever, you're just looking at a road over"
00:36:14,00:36:19,"and over again and your brain is under stimulated and just says, ""I don't, I don't need to be here."""
00:36:19,00:36:24,"I don't know, is it the silver side or is it the gold side? Do you know what animal has the smallest"
00:36:24,00:36:30,"brain in comparison to the size of its body? Oh, was it dinosaurs? I think they had small"
00:36:30,00:36:37,"brains. Ah, I'm more talking about extant animals. Okay. Is he on the panel now? You don't say anything?"
00:36:41,00:36:44,"Oh, they can't see us at home. Don't talk about leaving like that."
00:36:44,00:36:52,"Oh, wow. Is it, yeah, some kind of bird, maybe a dinosaur relative? It's not a bird. It is a fish"
00:36:52,00:36:59,and it's a fish called the bony-eared ass fish. Okay. Is it so dumb it doesn't know we're insulting
00:36:59,00:37:06,"it? Is that the... No, it's it. It's brain weighs less than one one-thousandth of its body weight. Wow."
00:37:06,00:37:10,"And of all the animals that we've tried so far, this is the smallest compared to its size. The"
00:37:10,00:37:15,"thing is it's got a really, really small brain, but it has massive sort of ear canals, so the ear"
00:37:15,00:37:21,"canals can grow bigger because the brain isn't there, which means you might call it its name,"
00:37:21,00:37:26,"and it might not understand it, but it will be able to hear it. We're going to have to move on,"
00:37:26,00:37:33,"guys, for a final fact in a second. Okay. The the stickleback fish, the three-spine stickleback"
00:37:33,00:37:39,"fish, the males have much bigger brains than the females, and this is really rare in the animal"
00:37:39,00:37:49,"kingdom. Okay. I can already see that I need to tread very carefully with this one, but yeah,"
00:37:49,00:37:55,"it's true, and we're not really sure why, but perhaps because the females gonads take up 40%"
00:37:55,00:38:01,"of her body mass, so maybe she's using up all the energy for reproduction, and the male doesn't"
00:38:01,00:38:06,"need to do that, and so grows a big brain instead. But he used it for like a lot of"
00:38:07,00:38:12,"distraction and deception and stuff. He's quite, the males are quite sneaky, and the females are"
00:38:12,00:38:19,"just doing lots of reproducing, and that's why that. Why do the, wow. No, no, everyone's way too"
00:38:19,00:38:25,"scared to make Eddie Jones know this. All right, hang on. Go on, Andy. Yeah, do it. It's on it. Get"
00:38:25,00:38:34,"cancelled. Why do the males need to be sneaky? Because the males will often, they'll have a nest"
00:38:34,00:38:39,"of eggs that they look after, and a lot of, sometimes a big group of females will come along"
00:38:39,00:38:45,"and eat all the eggs because they want their offspring to do better than the other offspring,"
00:38:45,00:38:50,and so the males sometimes use sneaky tricks to pretend they're in one place looking after
00:38:50,00:38:53,"some eggs, and they're actually, their eggs are in another place. That's great. I thought it was"
00:38:53,00:38:57,"sneakiness to try and persuade the females to mate, but it's actually to try and stop the females"
00:38:57,00:39:02,"from eating the eggs of the things you've already made. Okay, okay, okay, nice. Nice. Well done for"
00:39:02,00:39:05,"not getting cancelled. Yeah, no further questions, Your Honor."
00:39:05,00:39:16,"It is time for our final fact of the show, and that is my fact. My fact this week is that"
00:39:16,00:39:22,because the London offices of the Guinness World Records don't have a complete set of Guinness
00:39:22,00:39:29,"World Records books, whenever they need to find something out, they often need to consult the"
00:39:29,00:39:34,man who has the Guinness World Record for the owner of the most Guinness World Records books.
00:39:34,00:39:50,"This guy exists. His name is Martin Tovey, and he has thousands of unique Guinness Record books,"
00:39:50,00:39:54,"because the Guinness World Records, when it started, it obviously started as this one annual,"
00:39:54,00:39:59,"but over the years, they started doing books about sporting records, gaming records. There are"
00:39:59,00:40:05,"thousands of these different types of books, and we all here on the panel, we know Craig Glenday,"
00:40:05,00:40:09,"who is the editor-in-chief of the Guinness World Records, and I went to his office and I saw all"
00:40:09,00:40:14,"of the books that they have, and he told me this point. He said that, you know, we often have to"
00:40:14,00:40:19,"verify a fact if someone writes into us. If I don't have it, I just message Martin Tovey."
00:40:19,00:40:23,"That's brilliant. Yeah, and I say, what have you got? Can you get me? And he digs it out, and he"
00:40:23,00:40:29,usually has it. So the most recent time that Craig had to do it was because a porn actor in America
00:40:29,00:40:32,"was claiming that he was listed in the Guinness World Records, and Craig thought this can't be"
00:40:32,00:40:37,"right. It's a family-friendly book. We're not going to be like, you know, biggest dick, I don't know."
00:40:37,00:40:44,"That is not in there, right? That record also belongs to a guy who got it stuck in a bottle"
00:40:44,00:40:54,"with potassium. It's mostly bottle, but still. So he looked it up for Craig."
00:40:54,00:40:58,"Oh, because he said, I'm in, you know, 1974, and he had that one and could look it up."
00:40:58,00:41:03,"Yeah, I think, or either it was just, we're missing this one, and I've checked everything else,"
00:41:03,00:41:07,"and so, yeah, and it turns out that the porn actor is lying. It's not in there."
00:41:07,00:41:14,"You know the adjudicators, the people who turn up to assess whether the record is broken or not?"
00:41:14,00:41:18,"Okay, yeah, someone with a stopwatch. Yeah, they have a stopwatch and they have a blazer,"
00:41:18,00:41:23,"that which they all have to wear, the official Guinness blazer, and they are like ninjas, okay?"
00:41:23,00:41:28,"They're not allowed to eat or drink alcohol when they're with the record setters. Obviously,"
00:41:28,00:41:37,"they are allowed to eat food. God, sorry. They're not allowed to socialize at all with the people"
00:41:37,00:41:40,"trying to set the records. They have to keep their distance. And the other thing they do is,"
00:41:40,00:41:46,they make the certificate for your record before you even try it. They bring it along to the record
00:41:46,00:41:51,"breaking attempt, and if you don't succeed, they take it away with them, which is very cruel."
00:41:51,00:41:55,That's not the cruelest thing. They don't rip it up in front of your face. They shred it.
00:41:55,00:42:01,Do they really? Because I don't think I shred it in front of the charity or the children who are
00:42:01,00:42:06,"trying to break a record for like most sausage dogs, but they do, they do shred it because"
00:42:06,00:42:11,"sometimes people have gone through the bins afterwards, trying to steal the certificate,"
00:42:11,00:42:17,which they've thrown away. One of these people is here. Oh really? There's an official Guinness
00:42:17,00:42:22,"World Records book representative here, because the University of Brussels broke a record yesterday,"
00:42:22,00:42:28,"like most built robots. The children here built small robots in a chain, and they had the longest"
00:42:28,00:42:33,"chain of robots in a row, and they succeeded, so they will receive the certificate afterwards."
00:42:33,00:42:35,That's amazing. Up your shredder.
00:42:35,00:42:46,"I was looking at a few other records that have been broken in the last week or so,"
00:42:46,00:42:53,"so the largest t-shirt in the world, that was in Romania, and they made it out of 500,000"
00:42:53,00:42:59,"recycled bottles. It's absolutely enormous. It's in the middle of a field, and they took it then"
00:42:59,00:43:04,"apart afterwards, and they've turned it into 10,000 items of clothing that they're giving to"
00:43:04,00:43:12,young people who can't buy clothes elsewhere. The most bats ever in a cave was broken. That
00:43:12,00:43:18,"was in San Antonio. The number of bats in this cave, is it more or less than the population of"
00:43:18,00:43:24,"Belgium? Oh my god. Well, let me tell you the population of Belgium, according to Wikipedia,"
00:43:24,00:43:28,is 11.5 million. I think more bats in a cave than people in Belgium. I'm going to have a
00:43:28,00:43:34,"pun. By a long way, or? I think double. Double the number. Well, it's 15 million. Wow. 15 million"
00:43:34,00:43:40,"bats in this cave, and someone walked up to the cave, and as the bats came out. An adjudicator"
00:43:40,00:43:49,"with a clicker. Yeah. Like a bouncer at a nightclub. And a shredder. Yeah, yeah, yeah. They said,"
00:43:49,00:43:56,"they said that the bats sometimes will come out all at once, and it would make a cloud of bats,"
00:43:56,00:44:03,"which is 50 kilometers by 30 kilometers. Wow. That's insane, isn't it? That's so cool. And the"
00:44:03,00:44:10,"man with the world's longest nose died. Oh. He died last week. And his father, Gepetto, was said to"
00:44:10,00:44:23,"be very sad. Such a shame. There's another record that I found, which is that there's a Guinness"
00:44:23,00:44:29,World Record for the most poisonous book ever. Oh. And it's called Shadows from the Wall of Death.
00:44:29,00:44:35,"It's from 1874, and it was written to warn the public about the dangers of arsenic-based dyes"
00:44:35,00:44:40,that are used in contemporary wallpaper manufacturers. And so he took 86 leafs of these
00:44:40,00:44:46,things and bound them into one book. So it's the arsenic level in this book is off the chart. Oh my
00:44:46,00:44:52,"God. Yeah. Don't lick your fingers to turn the pages, right? Yeah, exactly. Yeah. And that was,"
00:44:52,00:44:58,"you could buy that, could you? No, I think it was like a one-up. Yeah, an example. It's like the"
00:44:58,00:45:03,"notebooks of Marie Curie, who are still kept away from people. They're still so radioactive that"
00:45:03,00:45:08,they're dangerous to interact with. So cool. Did you hear about the Irish guy who tried to beat
00:45:08,00:45:14,"the world record for longest live burial? No. This was cool. It was in 1968. He was called Mick Meany,"
00:45:14,00:45:21,"and I think he did about two months. He did a long time underground, and he had, he lived on"
00:45:21,00:45:27,"steak and cigarettes, which were fed to him through a tube. And then he had a hatch beneath him,"
00:45:27,00:45:32,"which he opened to go to the bathroom into. Oh, to sort of sort of pit beneath him. Sadly,"
00:45:32,00:45:39,he didn't invite an adjudicator. No. And so they couldn't give him the thing. That's not even a
00:45:39,00:45:45,"shredder then. No, they shredded him at the end. It was so sad. Guys, we're going to have to wrap"
00:45:45,00:45:50,"up in a second. Yeah, we're the end of the show. But there's one thing about world records. There's"
00:45:50,00:45:56,"one guy who owns the world records of world records. Oh, cool. Okay. So there's one person who has the"
00:45:56,00:46:04,"most world records, and then a mathematician heard this, and he said, this guy has an endless amount"
00:46:04,00:46:11,"of world records, because he has the world records of most world records. This means he also has the"
00:46:11,00:46:18,"world records of world records of most world records, which is one. He also has the world"
00:46:18,00:46:23,records of world records of world records of world records. And that's what mathematicians do. So
00:46:23,00:46:31,"he has an endless amount of world records. That's incredible. We're just, we're talking about like"
00:46:31,00:46:35,"books, like collections of books and stuff like that. So I quickly looked at that. There was a"
00:46:35,00:46:42,"Christopher Columbus's son, who was called Anando Colon. He invented the bookshelf. Oh, and the"
00:46:42,00:46:48,"reason he did that is he wanted to read every book that existed in the whole world. Okay, and we"
00:46:48,00:46:52,"reckon that when he was born, it might have been possible. Obviously he was a baby, so he couldn't"
00:46:52,00:46:57,"read. But by the time he died, there was a massive amount of books being printed, and there's no way"
00:46:57,00:47:06,"he could have done it. And according to Google books, there are currently 129,864,880 books in the"
00:47:06,00:47:13,"world. If you decided to read them all, you did one an hour, nine to five, sat next to Niagara Falls,"
00:47:13,00:47:18,"then by the time you finished the last one, Niagara Falls would have ceased to exist due to erosion."
00:47:19,00:47:25,"Wow. Better make it nine to six. Yeah, better, better crack on. Yeah."
00:47:25,00:47:37,That is it. That is all of our facts. And if you'd like to get in contact with any of us about the
00:47:37,00:47:42,"things that we've said over the course of this podcast, we can be found on our Twitter accounts."
