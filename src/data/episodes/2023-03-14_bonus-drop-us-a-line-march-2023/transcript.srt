00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,180
 Hi everyone, welcome to this week's Drop As A Line.

3
00:00:04,180 --> 00:00:09,760
 Before we get going, I have some news, some exclusive news for subscribers to notice things

4
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:14,320
 afish and that is that we are going to do a live show.

5
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:20,440
 The live show will be at the British Library in London on Friday the 21st of April.

6
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:27,000
 It will be myself, Andy Dan, and an as yet unannounced and let's be honest undecided

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:34,080
 celebrity or fun person who will be talking about fantastical animal theories throughout

8
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:35,580
 the ages.

9
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:39,440
 It's going to be really really fun, it's quite a small venue compared to what we normally

10
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:44,640
 do so the tickets will go fast and we'll announce this to the non-subscribers on Friday.

11
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:49,800
 So you guys who are hearing this during the week, I advise you to go to gnosisthingasafish.com

12
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:52,880
 as soon as you can and get your tickets now.

13
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:59,700
 Anyway, I think the only thing left to say is, on with Drop As A Line!

 [Music]

15
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:10,700
 Hi!

16
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:11,700
 Hi!

17
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:12,700
 Hello!

18
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:15,880
 Hello, welcome to the first ever Drop As A Line without...

19
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:17,380
 Sons Tyszinski.

20
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:18,380
 Very sad.

21
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:21,800
 But the three of us are here, James is here, Dan's here.

22
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:27,920
 We're going to carry on as best we can and we've got some great correspondence so you

23
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:29,720
 won't even notice actually that Anna's not here.

24
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:31,220
 Isn't that right, guys?

25
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:32,220
 Yeah.

26
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:33,700
 Dan, you can say something at any point.

27
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:37,900
 Every time I do, I'd wait for Anna to take me down and I'm sad that that's not going

28
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:38,900
 to happen.

29
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:39,900
 Dan, you're free now.

30
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:40,900
 You can mouth off all sorts of stuff.

31
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:41,900
 I love anything out of it.

32
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:42,900
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, absolutely.

33
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:46,880
 He's been sending me messages of what to say whenever you say something stupid.

34
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:50,700
 Oh, we've got some cracking stuff, we've got some great Get Yourself Off the Hooks, we've

35
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:53,480
 got some I'm Actuallys of the Week.

36
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:55,040
 There's some big stuff coming up.

37
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,040
 Right.

38
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:57,040
 So let's just...

39
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,040
 Great tease.

40
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:59,040
 Let's dive straight in.

41
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,040
 Yeah, I like that.

42
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,200
 And we'll be back after these messages.

43
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:05,920
 Okay, so there's a bit of bonus information or...

44
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,600
 Actually, there are loads of bonus bits of information.

45
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:09,600
 I'll give this one.

46
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:10,600
 Okay.

47
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:11,600
 Let's start with Jennifer Back.

48
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:15,160
 During your No Such Thing as Proust's Sausage Roll episode a few weeks ago now, you mentioned

49
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:19,160
 South Korea's Jeju Island and how hotels have professional icebreakers for newlywed

50
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:20,740
 couples who don't know each other.

51
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:24,040
 That reminded me of my aunt's wedding video from the late 70s.

52
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:25,040
 Amazing.

53
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:30,340
 So Jennifer's mom and one side of her family is Korean and this wedding happened in Korea.

54
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:31,340
 Right?

55
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:35,360
 During the reception, there was a dorky, awkward man in a red jacket, like the one in Michael

56
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,400
 Jackson's Beat It video.

57
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,400
 He was flailing about.

58
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,320
 So is she talking about Michael Jackson?

59
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,320
 No, no.

60
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:43,700
 Is there another person who's dorky and...

61
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:44,700
 During the...

62
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:45,700
 No, no, no, the jacket.

63
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:46,700
 Yeah.

64
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:47,700
 The jacket is similar to Michael Jackson's jacket.

65
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:48,700
 Oh, not the dorky guy.

66
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:49,700
 God.

67
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:50,700
 Sorry, Jennifer.

68
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:52,720
 We're actually butchering a really good email.

69
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:58,000
 This guy wearing a jacket like Michael Jackson's jacket was flailing about vaguely rhythmically

70
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,320
 on the dance floor.

71
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:04,000
 It was explained to me that the man was hired so that the older, stuffy or awkward relatives,

72
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,280
 mostly male, would look at him, think, "Well, I can dance better than that."

73
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,280
 That is genius.

74
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:10,240
 How they get up on the dance floor?

75
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,640
 That is so clever.

76
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:12,640
 That's not different.

77
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:17,200
 We did the fact about every Christmas cracker contains a terrible joke because a terrible

78
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,700
 joke unites people around the table.

79
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:21,180
 Everyone thinks it sucks.

80
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:22,780
 This is the physical version of that.

81
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:26,180
 This guy is the Judas Goat of the wedding dance floor.

82
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:27,180
 Yeah.

83
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:28,180
 I wonder if it works.

84
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:29,180
 I think it is.

85
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:30,180
 Because that is the problem, isn't it?

86
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:35,300
 Because I used to work in a hotel and we did lots of weddings and so I've been to more

87
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:39,540
 weddings than most people because I've worked them and it's the same in all of them that

88
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:43,540
 no one dances, no one dances, no one dances and then 10 minutes before the end when all

89
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:47,920
 the people who are working want to go home, suddenly everyone decides, "Oh, let's get

90
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,480
 my dancing shoes on."

91
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:50,480
 Yeah.

92
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,480
 Well, this is the way forward.

93
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:52,480
 Amazing.

94
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:53,480
 Just dance badly.

95
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:54,480
 How one person dances better.

96
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,480
 I know.

97
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:56,480
 It's such a good show.

98
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,640
 I wonder if you could set up a whole company whereby you've did multiple things where

99
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:01,080
 you've injected someone who's crap at it.

100
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,980
 Is that what I'm doing on this show?

101
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:04,480
 No, no, no.

102
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,480
 Hang on.

103
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:08,240
 We don't know what you are doing.

104
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:11,920
 It can't be that.

105
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,180
 I'm listening and think, "You know what?

106
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:14,180
 I could be a podcast."

107
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:16,140
 That's why there are so many podcasts.

108
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:19,140
 That's why everyone's and their mum's got a podcast now.

109
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:24,220
 We were one of the first podcasts and everyone heard Dan do it and thought, "You know what?

110
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:25,220
 Rory Stewart."

111
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:26,540
 He thought I could do that.

112
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:27,540
 You're welcome, Rory.

113
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:31,420
 But under this idea, that would mean that I'm actually secretly a genius who's just

114
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:32,420
 putting this on.

115
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:33,420
 No, I don't think-

116
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:34,820
 To make you guys believe that you can do the podcast.

117
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:35,820
 What did Jennifer say?

118
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:38,820
 I don't think Jennifer's email says anything about this guy actually being a good dancer.

119
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:42,080
 Jennifer says he was flailing about on the dance floor.

120
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,560
 I'll do that with my mouth.

121
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:48,920
 It's not like, "Is this guy naturally a bad dancer or is he like Les Dawson who was actually

122
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:52,640
 a brilliant pianist but then just pretended to play the piano badly?"

123
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:53,640
 That's right.

124
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:54,640
 We don't know.

125
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:57,400
 This was in the late 70s in Korea, so we may never know whether this guy actually was

126
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,400
 a great dancer.

127
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,640
 But we've got the video.

128
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:01,640
 She's got the video.

129
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:04,160
 She said, "I was watching a VHS."

130
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,160
 Yeah.

131
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:08,800
 Surely, if you gave that to Bruno Tonle only or whatever he's called from Strictly, he would

132
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:12,220
 be able to look at that person and tell if they would deliberately be in bad or if they

133
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:13,220
 were actually bad.

134
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:14,220
 You're absolutely right.

135
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:15,220
 There is a wedding video.

136
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:16,220
 You're right then.

137
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:18,900
 Can she please upload just that guy to YouTube and send it to us?

138
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:19,900
 Please.

139
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:20,900
 This is great.

140
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:21,900
 Yeah.

141
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:26,440
 Jennifer, if you can be bothered to do that, amazing, but you've already done so much for

142
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:27,440
 us.

143
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,440
 So thank you.

144
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:29,440
 Just one more thing, please.

145
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,440
 All right.

146
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:31,440
 Here's a great one.

147
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,440
 From Michael O.D., right?

148
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:35,340
 We talked about nicotine and smoking a few weeks ago.

149
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:36,340
 Okay.

150
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:37,340
 Yeah.

151
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:40,840
 We talked with a Swedish company which invented the first nicotine chewing gum, Nicorette.

152
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:45,520
 It was developed for the Swedish government in order to be used by submariners when they

153
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,560
 banned smoking on board submarines.

154
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,560
 Oh, yeah.

155
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:51,080
 Because actually we talked about smoking on submarines, didn't we?

156
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:52,080
 Yeah.

157
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,080
 That's right.

158
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:54,080
 How interesting.

159
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,080
 How cool is that?

160
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:56,080
 Yeah, that's really cool.

161
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,080
 Yeah.

162
00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:01,260
 But one of the problems, obviously, with smoking is making lots of smoke and stuff and that's

163
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:03,320
 going to be bad for the other people there.

164
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:05,640
 You're still going to have lots of bits of chewing gum.

165
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:11,140
 If everyone's eating chewing gum, the bottoms of all the tables are just going to be as

166
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:12,140
 happy as that.

167
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:13,140
 Yeah.

168
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:14,140
 Yeah.

169
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:15,140
 True.

170
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:19,100
 Maybe if they eject it out of the back of the torpedo tubes or I'm not completely sure

171
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:22,500
 where that works, but that could leave a trail, you know?

172
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:23,500
 Yeah.

173
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:26,620
 Stick it on the end of the periscope if your enemies can't see out of them.

174
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:33,020
 I've got a fact about there was an old way of attacking submarines where you would kind

175
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:37,300
 of take your boat up to where the submarine was, go over to the periscope with a hammer

176
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:40,300
 and then smash the periscope so they couldn't see out of it.

177
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:41,300
 That's right.

178
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:42,300
 Don't know that.

179
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:43,300
 I love that.

180
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:44,300
 Yeah.

181
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:45,620
 They hired people specifically and gave them hammers.

182
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:46,620
 Yeah.

183
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:49,660
 And so in the dead of the night, they would go and they would sail close to them.

184
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:50,660
 Wow.

185
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:51,660
 Isn't that?

186
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:54,620
 It's so lo-fi, but actually if you think about it, if you get rid of that, they're completely

187
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:55,620
 blind, aren't they?

188
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:56,620
 Yeah.

189
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:57,620
 Yeah.

190
00:06:57,620 --> 00:06:58,620
 That's really cool.

191
00:06:58,620 --> 00:06:59,620
 I also love early submarine stuff.

192
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:00,620
 Yeah.

193
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:01,620
 Yeah.

194
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:02,620
 Just siggies and nautical stuff.

195
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:03,620
 Yeah.

196
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:07,340
 I can't remember which war it was, but they used to be in the channel between France and

197
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:08,340
 here.

198
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:12,900
 They used to be stationed, huge boys, like these, they were like, they were, Augustus

199
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:13,900
 Gloop.

200
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:14,900
 Yeah.

201
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:18,540
 They were all like mini houses.

202
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:19,540
 Like they were one room.

203
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:22,340
 We're not allowed to say he's a huge boy anymore, I don't know if you've been reading

204
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:23,340
 the news.

205
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:24,340
 Boys.

206
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:25,340
 Just boys.

207
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:26,340
 Yeah.

208
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:27,340
 Yeah.

209
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:28,340
 Big bald boy.

210
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:29,340
 Big bald boy.

211
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:32,540
 So if you were a pilot that was flying over and you got on the gun battle and you crashed,

212
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:36,220
 this was, I think it was the Germans, they would know that these were stationed along

213
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:37,220
 the way.

214
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:40,100
 So they could try and make their way in a raft, whatever came out of the plane.

215
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:41,100
 Clink to a boy.

216
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:43,460
 And inside it would be cigarettes.

217
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:45,380
 And inside it would be alcohol.

218
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:49,760
 And inside it would be cards so you could play games and stuff until you were picked

219
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:50,760
 up.

220
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:51,760
 Hang on.

221
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:52,760
 Hang on.

222
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:53,760
 Someone's taken the little dog.

223
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:54,760
 I'm not.

224
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:55,760
 This is so annoying.

225
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:56,760
 I'm leaving the boy.

226
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:57,760
 What?

227
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:58,760
 The little dog.

228
00:07:58,760 --> 00:07:59,760
 The monopoly little dog.

229
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:00,760
 Yeah.

230
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:01,760
 And what are you saying?

231
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:02,760
 Because it's like card games.

232
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:03,760
 Card games.

233
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:04,760
 No, you're right.

234
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:05,760
 Hang on.

235
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:06,760
 Where's the three of clubs?

236
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:07,760
 Oh, there's no point.

237
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:08,760
 Right.

238
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:09,760
 I'm sailing back.

239
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:10,760
 I'm going in the sea.

240
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:11,760
 I'm dancing.

241
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:12,760
 And so in the morning, I think it was, they would, or maybe even at night time, you would

242
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:13,760
 just do a scoop up.

243
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:14,760
 Yeah.

244
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:15,760
 They would go and check.

245
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:17,120
 They would check all the boys just to see if there were any, you know, fallen soldiers

246
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,120
 in there.

247
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,120
 That's really funny.

248
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:24,520
 In New Zealand, the islands off New Zealand, they would put goats on there, just put goats

249
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:25,520
 on the islands.

250
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:26,520
 Yeah.

251
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:30,140
 And the idea is that people who, in the age of sail, you're sailing down there,

252
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:31,720
 you might get shipwrecked.

253
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:34,960
 And if you end up on an island, a goat is a perfect thing because it's going to give

254
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:41,000
 you some food with the milk and it's like a service station for, you know, shipwrecked

255
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
 people.

256
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,600
 How many islands biodiversity must have been absolutely destroyed?

257
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,600
 Yeah.

258
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,600
 Yeah.

259
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:47,600
 Yeah.

260
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,600
 Yeah.

261
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,600
 Speaking of a biological ravaging, this is a crowbar.

262
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:58,600
 Speaking of an unusual trans-global, look, here's Jay McCabe and he says, see if you,

263
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:01,300
 or remember immediately what we're talking about, last year, my six-year-old daughter

264
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:04,020
 wanted to know if a snail could go around the world.

265
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:05,020
 Okay.

266
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:10,860
 So this is Andy's idea of, would you rather have a million quid or a snail?

267
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:12,180
 It's always chasing you.

268
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:13,180
 It's always chasing you.

269
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:14,180
 It touches you.

270
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:15,180
 Yeah.

271
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:16,180
 When it touches you, you die.

272
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:17,180
 Yeah.

273
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:18,180
 I should say I stole it from the internet.

274
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:19,180
 So it's definitely not my thing.

275
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:22,660
 Anyway, Jay says, he decided to help his daughter with a bit of logic and with the following,

276
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:24,780
 very simplified maths, we came up with the following.

277
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:31,100
 So lots of rounding up and down, but basically, he's put in all the maths that they've done.

278
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:35,280
 The speed is very rounded to a metre an hour and time travelled in a day is 20 metres based

279
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:39,200
 on 19 hours of waking and five hours of sleep, blah, blah, blah.

280
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:42,800
 But basically, all you need to do is go between a few locations and the snail will get stuck

281
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:46,600
 changing directions because you'll destroy the progress they've made.

282
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:50,480
 And did they say what the locations might be or how far apart they would need to be?

283
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,480
 No.

284
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:53,560
 Jay said you don't even need to move countries.

285
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:54,560
 Okay.

286
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,660
 You just have a, you know, go down for a go-for-hotel.

287
00:09:56,660 --> 00:10:01,180
 If you lived in the Vatican City, if you were the Pope, you would have to move countries.

288
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:02,180
 And what a film.

289
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:03,180
 What a film.

290
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:04,680
 That would be Pope vs. Snail.

291
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:05,680
 Cocaine Snail.

292
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:10,620
 Man vs. B. They need a sequel for Man vs. B.

293
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:13,600
 Pope vs. Snail vs. Cocaine Snail.

294
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,940
 Oh, that's interesting.

295
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:22,820
 I would like to know from their calculations how far you would have to move from different,

296
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:27,600
 like if I spent half the year in Bolton and half the year in London, would I be okay?

297
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,600
 I think you would.

298
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:32,280
 If it's 20 metres a day, six months of 20 metres a day isn't going to be...

299
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:33,680
 Doesn't feel like a gate to Bolton.

300
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:34,680
 No.

301
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:38,480
 I'd like to know if the daughter just wanted a whimsical answer or if she had to sit through

302
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:42,120
 hours of whiteboard math as she worked this out.

303
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:47,460
 Because if it's that version, that she liked the whiteboard stuff, that's a cool kid, man.

304
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:50,120
 I don't think I could do that with my kids.

305
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:52,120
 So yeah, game on.

306
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:54,380
 Michelle Foreman writes, "I've been meaning to write an instance.

307
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:57,780
 I listened to the episode where you mentioned a woman was found guilty of murder because

308
00:10:57,780 --> 00:11:00,180
 the parrot said, 'Don't shoot.'

309
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:02,420
 I think in the voice of the murdered man."

310
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:06,540
 And we wonder, perhaps she might have been saying, 'Don't shoot.'

311
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:08,220
 It might have been altering.

312
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:09,460
 Can parrots do voices, basically?

313
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:12,660
 And Michelle says, "I can tell you they sure can.

314
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:16,820
 Growing up, my friend's stepfather had a parrot named Jasper, a Congo gray.

315
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:21,500
 And Jasper could mimic every member of the family from my friend to her mother to her

316
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:22,500
 stepdad.

317
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:26,600
 More than once, we thought we were being scolded by a parent when it was just Jasper looking

318
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:27,600
 for attention."

319
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,600
 Cool.

320
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:29,600
 How good is that?

321
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,600
 That is good.

322
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:31,600
 Thank you, Michelle.

323
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:38,360
 If you could get them to do famous people, and instead of John Cullshaw, you'd just have

324
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:40,560
 a parrot doing a load of impressions of people.

325
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:41,560
 That would be a good...

326
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:47,880
 Because I think they try to bring back spitting image, and it did okay, but I didn't do...

327
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:48,880
 Well, it's in the West End now.

328
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:49,880
 It's got a big shirt.

329
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:50,880
 Right.

330
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:51,880
 But if you did it with parrots...

331
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:52,880
 How much better would it be?

332
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:57,300
 So if you dressed them in little wigs and so on, and they're like, "Yeah, I think that's

333
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:58,640
 an amazing idea."

334
00:11:58,640 --> 00:11:59,960
 How many words can they...

335
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:00,960
 They're quite short skits.

336
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:01,960
 Yeah.

337
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:02,960
 No, they can do it.

338
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:03,960
 I'm sure they can do a few hundred words.

339
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:04,960
 Can they?

340
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:07,800
 But all the celebrities want a cracker.

341
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:08,800
 Yes.

342
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:11,900
 A bit of an "I'm actually" from Catherine Wall.

343
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:12,900
 Okay, come on then.

344
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:13,900
 Loving the episode.

345
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:14,900
 So those are...

346
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:17,020
 It's going to be a criticism sandwich here.

347
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:20,520
 So that also sounds like she's pressed pause on an episode.

348
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:22,440
 She's so furious about what she's going to write.

349
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:26,360
 Oh, do you know, I think this is the dropper's line of a dropper's a line.

350
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:31,040
 I think this is something I said in a dropper's a line, or in a bonus.

351
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:35,320
 In fact, I think it was someone else sent in this fact, and it's now been corrected by

352
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:36,920
 someone else within another dropper's a line.

353
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:37,920
 So we've developed our own eco.

354
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:38,920
 It's like a terrarium.

355
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:39,920
 Oh, got it.

356
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:40,920
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

357
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:41,920
 You know what I mean?

358
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:42,920
 Where it's its own contained microclimate.

359
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:43,920
 Yeah.

360
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:47,620
 So the fact was about when the longest day is, and it was stated that it was in October.

361
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:48,620
 Oh, yes.

362
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:49,620
 The cops go back.

363
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:50,620
 Yeah.

364
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:51,620
 It was dropper's a line.

365
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:52,620
 It was.

366
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:55,460
 This is true for places in the Northern Hemisphere who adopt daylight saving in October, but

367
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:59,300
 in Australia, the states that adopt daylight saving have the longest day in April.

368
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:01,780
 And not everywhere adopts daylight saving.

369
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:02,780
 As this fact is...

370
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:05,660
 And then there's the other end of the praise, the criticism sandwich.

371
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:09,260
 As this fact isn't universally true, I think it makes an awesome QI fact.

372
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:14,060
 So I would argue it completely invalidates it as a fact, but thank you.

373
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:15,060
 Anna said it wasn't a fact.

374
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:16,060
 Oh, no, she said it was a fact.

375
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:17,060
 She said it wasn't interesting.

376
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:18,060
 Who?

377
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:19,060
 Yeah.

378
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:24,560
 I couldn't believe you were so angry about that, Andy, that you just said, "No more.

379
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:29,400
 We're going to have to make up a story about her being pregnant."

380
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:30,560
 Got my way.

381
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:31,920
 We actually got center fact that was met.

382
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:35,460
 I think we've already mentioned on the show, which was, I just wanted to give a shout out

383
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:37,240
 because I don't think I named actually the person who sent it.

384
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:41,420
 We got an email from Andreas Marti, and the subject line of the email was Gibbon glory

385
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:42,420
 whole action.

386
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:43,420
 Oh, yeah.

387
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:47,220
 I think we just mentioned that on a show with, was it the one with Sarah or with Monica,

388
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:48,220
 maybe?

389
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:49,660
 No, it was the one with Monica, which hasn't gone out yet.

390
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:50,660
 Oh, yeah.

391
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:56,220
 Oh, well, you'll have to wait to see what the Gibbon glory whole action is all about.

392
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:57,220
 That's a proper teaser.

393
00:13:57,220 --> 00:13:58,220
 Yeah.

394
00:13:58,220 --> 00:14:01,900
 We need to change our email filter as well because nothing headlined Gibbon glory whole

395
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:04,020
 action should be getting into the inbox.

396
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:05,980
 Well, you clicked on it.

397
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:06,980
 You opened it.

398
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:07,980
 Yeah.

399
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:11,160
 And I was sorely disappointed by a factual story on the inside.

400
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:12,160
 Yeah.

401
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:16,880
 So if you want Andy to read your emails, then give it a nice title.

402
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:17,880
 Filf.

403
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:18,880
 Yeah.

404
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:19,880
 It's what we need.

405
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:20,880
 Yeah.

406
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:21,880
 Right.

407
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:22,880
 We're going to have to come to the big get yourself off the hook of this drop as a line.

408
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:23,880
 Oh, okay.

409
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:24,880
 Right.

410
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:25,880
 Sender of email.

411
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:26,880
 Alexander Pinkerton.

412
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:27,880
 Subject line.

413
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:28,880
 Bring it on bassoon boy.

414
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:36,560
 So, Dan, would you like to just briefly explain, and I should say this isn't the only email

415
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,180
 we've had.

416
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:41,780
 Bring it on.

417
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:47,060
 We were talking about Ethel Smythe and the fact and she was a composer who used to tie

418
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:51,420
 herself to a tree to get posture better so that she could conduct better when she was

419
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:52,420
 doing that.

420
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:56,780
 There was a story where she really didn't like the orchestra and how they were playing

421
00:14:56,780 --> 00:14:57,780
 her piece.

422
00:14:57,780 --> 00:15:01,100
 So she went around and picked up all the sheet music and fled the country so they weren't

423
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:02,620
 able to play it.

424
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:08,360
 I argued that why is it that you never see anyone who's part of an orchestra able to

425
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:11,920
 just play the pieces without the sheet music?

426
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:12,920
 Surely.

427
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:14,080
 'Cause Cole play do it.

428
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,080
 Cole play do it.

429
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,080
 Springsteen.

430
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:17,080
 Springsteen.

431
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:18,080
 Springsteen does it.

432
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,080
 Yep.

433
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:20,080
 Blink182 can do it.

434
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:22,400
 It's not hard, guys.

435
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:28,720
 And yeah, I put that out there and it's had apparently some response.

436
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:31,440
 There's been some response.

437
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:35,880
 And the Pinkerton's email is amazing, but it's so long and so detailed that we can't

438
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:37,120
 read the whole thing.

439
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:42,140
 But basically he studies the complexity of the music, such as the sort of stuff played

440
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:51,240
 by 816 Bar Blues on the E Street Band versus Rachmaninoff's Third Piano Concerto.

441
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:54,980
 The conclusion is that in less than a third of the time, so the Rachmaninoff Concerto

442
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:59,500
 is a third of the length, but there are double as many pieces of phrasing in it.

443
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:05,080
 And also, the boss Springsteen has the benefit of being able to play the music, which came

444
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:06,720
 into his own head without sheet guidance.

445
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:09,040
 He could probably improvise for more than three hours, but he's been playing the same

446
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,040
 material for five decades.

447
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,040
 And Alexander says-

448
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:14,120
 Wait, hang on, hang on, hang on.

449
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:16,040
 Any one of us can learn a Bruce Springsteen.

450
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:17,040
 We could learn-

451
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,040
 Are you digging here, Dan?

452
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:21,800
 I'm just saying, you can't argue when the music came to him.

453
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:24,120
 You're using the originator of that song in that circumstance.

454
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:25,120
 Okay.

455
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,120
 A lot of people cover his songs.

456
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,120
 Okay, well, in that case-

457
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,120
 They don't do it with sheet music.

458
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:30,040
 We should go on to the email from Kate Dunstan.

459
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:36,120
 I am a bassoonist, she says, and have played most of the classical repertoire and can say

460
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:39,640
 that you don't want to learn that stuff from memory, thousands of bars of different notes

461
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:44,640
 with different rhythms, keys, not chords, she says, with different rhythms, key signatures,

462
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:47,240
 time signatures, and bars of rest when you don't play.

463
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:50,560
 Most wind instruments can only play one note at a time and therefore can't play chords.

464
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:53,920
 So actually, you can't even learn the chords for these things because there aren't chords.

465
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:57,200
 She says, I have to concede that when I perform solo recital pieces, I do like to play those

466
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:59,800
 from memory, but this takes hundreds of hours of practice.

467
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:00,800
 So it's doable.

468
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:01,800
 Okay.

469
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:02,800
 You're really digging in.

470
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:08,400
 So we're going to have to go to the third email from Randall Peters for crying out loud

471
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,400
 there.

472
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,400
 Come on, Randall.

473
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,400
 Go to a classical concert sometime.

474
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:13,440
 Do you think the players are all jamming on a chord?

475
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:18,160
 I also happen to be a composer of orchestral music, including three operas.

476
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,800
 I wish everyone in an orchestra could fake their way through a piece of music, but it's

477
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:22,240
 incredibly complex.

478
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,360
 Everyone has their own intricate part of play.

479
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:25,280
 The notation is very specific.

480
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,080
 Let's not pretend they should know all the chords.

481
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:28,520
 Sometimes we don't even have chords.

482
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:30,200
 Use that as a fact.

483
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:33,960
 I've attached a PDF of the first violin part for a 30-minute orchestra piece of mine.

484
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:38,120
 I respect, says Randall, for any self-demeaning attempt at a joke, but up with this, I will

485
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:39,120
 not put.

486
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,840
 Please don't dig in because I'll get more emails and no one has to read those out,

487
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:42,840
 right?

488
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:47,080
 What I'm being forced to do here is to admit that I was joking, which really pisses me

489
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:48,080
 off.

490
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:50,360
 Anyway, thank you everyone for your correspondence.

491
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:51,360
 It was a brilliant time.

492
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:54,960
 It's my favourite slamming I've had from a group of people in my life.

493
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,280
 I just love that we've had a composer.

494
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:57,280
 We've had a bassoonist.

495
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:58,280
 We've had all sorts of people.

496
00:17:58,280 --> 00:17:59,280
 Yeah, yeah.

497
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,280
 You know, it's very flattering.

498
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:01,280
 I'm sorry.

499
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,280
 I'm sorry I upset so many people.

500
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:07,440
 I reckon there's one conductor who's getting all these emails sent at one time going, "Bassoon

501
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,440
 sent yours.

502
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:11,960
 First violin sent yours."

503
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,760
 Can I just say, though, one last thing.

504
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:14,760
 No, we've got so much more to get through.

505
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,880
 I'm not saying it's like a Springsteen song.

506
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,640
 I'm saying they are all notes.

507
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:21,600
 They are all things that you play and they're at work and they're memorised.

508
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,160
 I'm not saying it's less or more complex.

509
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,760
 It's obviously more complex.

510
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:26,960
 It's a classical piece.

511
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:27,960
 I know that.

512
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:31,920
 Well, I'll give the last word to Alexander who says, "It is more impressive from a purely

513
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:36,120
 technical standpoint to see a 25-year-old soloist smash out a piece of incredibly complex

514
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:40,480
 music from memory than it is for an old rocker to do three hours of their back catalogue.

515
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:45,200
 Which of those is cooler is not an argument I want to engage with."

516
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,200
 Which is fair enough.

517
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,600
 I've got to get myself off a hook here.

518
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:48,600
 Okay.

519
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:52,800
 Dave Reinersman writes, "I'd like to offer a defence of Andy's boring facts."

520
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:53,920
 Hang on.

521
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:59,760
 I know you curate these things, but I sort of feel a bit put out that you've had me

522
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:02,520
 ruined and now you're going to defend yourself.

523
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:03,520
 It's not me defending myself.

524
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:04,520
 It's Dave Reinersman.

525
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:05,520
 Thank you, Dave.

526
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:06,520
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

527
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:10,680
 Dave is just saying that, you know, often if you look at something, a seemingly dull

528
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:12,920
 fact that will have depth and curiosities on closer inspection.

529
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,800
 But not this case.

530
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:17,320
 And it just happens to be.

531
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:19,080
 What was he referring to?

532
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:20,720
 Just to my boring facts, apparently.

533
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:21,720
 This is an overall comment.

534
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:26,400
 I think I've had a run of them recently where I've talked about trams or about ... Yeah.

535
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:30,240
 But Dave says, "Not to make this too grand a statement, but it's that humbling perspective

536
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:33,440
 on the world that has kept me coming back to the QI media empire for so long."

537
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:34,440
 So I guess.

538
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:35,440
 Get you've saved.

539
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:36,440
 You're welcome.

540
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:37,440
 Yeah.

541
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,440
 All right.

542
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:42,680
 I'll give you a proper one where I've ... There's a proper one where I might have made a boo-boo.

543
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:43,680
 Bill Sheffield.

544
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:44,680
 Yeah.

545
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:45,680
 Great name.

546
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:47,080
 It seems odd to me that you spoke about the reason that TVs are so cheap now is that they

547
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:50,840
 figured out how to cut more screens out of the mother glass, which we did say.

548
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:54,800
 The reason TVs are so cheap now is that they used to depend on the cathode ray technology

549
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:58,800
 where the image was created by a cathode ray gun shooting electrons onto a curved glass

550
00:19:58,800 --> 00:19:59,800
 surface.

551
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:02,320
 Effectively a particle accelerator cathode ray gun.

552
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:08,840
 So the cathode ray tube, or maybe the screen, was curved both up and down and across, much

553
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:14,680
 like a Pringle, meaning each TV screen needed to be blown molded one at a time.

554
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:15,680
 Yes.

555
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:16,680
 No, that's fair.

556
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:21,880
 Although, I thought that the ... I don't want to start defending things, but I thought

557
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:26,360
 the point was, even since we got flat screens, they're getting cheaper and cheaper, right?

558
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:32,120
 I think that is it, but Bill is also absolutely right that, and he says, figuring out how to

559
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:35,520
 cut more screens from the mother glass is not as big a deal as having a flat screen in

560
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:39,040
 the first place, which is completely fair, and I accept that.

561
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:40,400
 I forgot about the mother glass.

562
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:43,240
 That's one of those facts that I hope I continue to forget and hear about, because it's just

563
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:48,000
 such a fun idea, like learning that new for the first time is just a such a wonderful

564
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
 thought.

565
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
 Yeah, absolutely.

566
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
 A couple more?

567
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
 Yeah.

568
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,640
 Lena Nilsson, this is ... Do you remember the nutmeg thing we talked about?

569
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:57,360
 This is an Anna thing, where Anna ...

570
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:02,520
 She ate a load of nutmeg that, no, her husband made something with some nutmeg in, and she

571
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:04,960
 made herself vomit because she thought it was poisonous.

572
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:05,960
 That's right.

573
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:10,320
 Or it wasn't also that she let him eat it, as in she tested him out, but didn't tell

574
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:11,320
 him.

575
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:12,320
 Yeah.

576
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:13,720
 That's a good fact from Lena Nilsson.

577
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:18,320
 In 2008, a Swedish cooking magazine called Matmagazinet had to issue an apology after

578
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:22,960
 a family experienced rapid heartbeats, excessive sweating, etc., from eating the world's tastiest

579
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:26,080
 apple cake.

580
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:27,580
 That actually feels worth it.

581
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:33,040
 If it's the world's tastiest apple cake, I think I would be willing to eat the world's

582
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:36,160
 tastiest apple cake for a few heart palpitations.

583
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:37,160
 Fair enough.

584
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:39,000
 Well, here's what had happened, as Lena says.

585
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:45,320
 The recipe had accidentally listed the amount of ground nutmeg as 20 nutmegs, instead of

586
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:46,320
 two milliliters.

587
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:47,320
 Oh my God.

588
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:48,320
 20 nutmegs.

589
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:52,560
 They quickly withdrew the issue when they discovered the mistake, but apparently one

590
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:56,680
 family had already bought it and didn't react with any suspicion to the absurd amount of

591
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:57,960
 poisonous spice.

592
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:00,640
 So did they have to ... They made it, right?

593
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:01,640
 They made it.

594
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:03,800
 So they had to grate all these nutmegs, I guess.

595
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:04,800
 Yes.

596
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:05,800
 Right?

597
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:06,800
 Oh my God.

598
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:07,800
 I mean, that would have taken an hour, at least.

599
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:11,120
 The editor-in-chief said we didn't think it was possible to eat a cake like that, since

600
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:14,080
 it would be terribly bitter, but it turned out one group did that anyway.

601
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:15,080
 Wow.

602
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:16,080
 What's what happened to them, sorry?

603
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:20,000
 They were fine, but I think they had some sweating and palpitations and heartbeats,

604
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,560
 but I think they were all right.

605
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:22,560
 That's really funny.

606
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:23,560
 Isn't that great?

607
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:24,560
 Thank you, Lena.

608
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:25,560
 One last one.

609
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:26,560
 Okay.

610
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:27,560
 This is from David McLaren.

611
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:28,560
 Okay.

612
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:34,720
 Long time listener, writing in because I have a tidbit regarding a slip-up Andy made regarding

613
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,360
 the treatment for the two-headed turtle.

614
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:37,680
 Do you remember this?

615
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:39,560
 Oh, gosh, this is a long time ago.

616
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:40,560
 A couple of months ago.

617
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:41,560
 Yeah, we talked about this.

618
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:43,880
 There's the two-headed turtle, and the two heads prefer different foods.

619
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:44,880
 Yeah.

620
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,640
 And they would sometimes fight over lettuce leaves as well.

621
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:47,640
 Bingo.

622
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:48,640
 Yeah, yeah.

623
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:49,640
 Oh, yeah.

624
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:53,640
 And I made a mistake because I said they treat the turtle's heads by applying valium

625
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:55,440
 to them, and I meant Vaseline.

626
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:56,440
 That's right.

627
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:57,440
 I remember that.

628
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:02,320
 Andy mistakenly said, "Valium diazepam is applied to their heads when he meant Vaseline."

629
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:04,400
 Surprisingly, Dan was the one to correct this.

630
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:07,800
 I'm just reading David's.

631
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:11,040
 Thank you, David, for qualifying that.

632
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:17,360
 But as David says, "When I was working as a hospital pharmacist, I prepared a diazepam

633
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:22,080
 vaginal suppository for a patient."

634
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:25,680
 First I was convinced I was misreading the script, but it's not common, and there are

635
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:32,040
 multiple studies looking at the topical application of diazepam, valium, and it can actually be

636
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:34,920
 useful for a variety of issues, not just anxiety.

637
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:35,920
 Yeah.

638
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:37,920
 So maybe I was right.

639
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:40,000
 Maybe what he seems to be saying.

640
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
 Yeah, yeah.

641
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:46,160
 But there's a difference between a turtle's head and a vagina.

642
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:47,160
 Absolutely.

643
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:49,160
 That's an uncontroversial statement.

644
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:50,160
 I don't know.

645
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:51,160
 We'll get lettuce next week.

646
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:52,160
 Yes, sir.

647
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:53,160
 I'm a turtle keeper.

648
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:54,160
 I'm pervert.

649
00:23:54,160 --> 00:24:07,320
 They're not going to show you.

650
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:12,840
 They are very easily mixed up.

651
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:13,840
 Oh, dear.

652
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:14,840
 Yeah.

653
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:15,840
 I just thought it was interesting.

654
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:18,040
 I didn't know you could get diazepam vaginal suppositories.

655
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:19,040
 That is really interesting.

656
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:20,040
 That is surprising.

657
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:23,720
 I didn't know you got any suppositories that went anywhere but up the bottom.

658
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:26,440
 Oh, well, they're colpesteries, aren't they, if they're--

659
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:27,440
 Oh, no.

660
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:28,440
 I suppose they are.

661
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:29,440
 No, I think you're right.

662
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,440
 I think they are.

663
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:31,440
 Yeah.

664
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:32,440
 Well.

665
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:33,440
 Maybe he put it in the wrong colp.

666
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:36,440
 Oh, gosh.

667
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:37,440
 Oh.

668
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:38,440
