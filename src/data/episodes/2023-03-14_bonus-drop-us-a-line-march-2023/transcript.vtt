 Hi everyone, welcome to this week's Drop As A Line.

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:09.760
 Before we get going, I have some news, some exclusive news for subscribers to notice things

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:14.320
 afish and that is that we are going to do a live show.

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:20.440
 The live show will be at the British Library in London on Friday the 21st of April.

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:27.000
 It will be myself, Andy Dan, and an as yet unannounced and let's be honest undecided

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:34.080
 celebrity or fun person who will be talking about fantastical animal theories throughout

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:35.580
 the ages.

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:39.440
 It's going to be really really fun, it's quite a small venue compared to what we normally

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:44.640
 do so the tickets will go fast and we'll announce this to the non-subscribers on Friday.

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.800
 So you guys who are hearing this during the week, I advise you to go to gnosisthingasafish.com

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.880
 as soon as you can and get your tickets now.

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:59.700
 Anyway, I think the only thing left to say is, on with Drop As A Line!

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:09.700
 [Music]

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:10.700
 Hi!

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:11.700
 Hi!

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:12.700
 Hello!

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:15.880
 Hello, welcome to the first ever Drop As A Line without...

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:17.380
 Sons Tyszinski.

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:18.380
 Very sad.

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:21.800
 But the three of us are here, James is here, Dan's here.

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:27.920
 We're going to carry on as best we can and we've got some great correspondence so you

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:29.720
 won't even notice actually that Anna's not here.

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:31.220
 Isn't that right, guys?

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:32.220
 Yeah.

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:33.700
 Dan, you can say something at any point.

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:37.900
 Every time I do, I'd wait for Anna to take me down and I'm sad that that's not going

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:38.900
 to happen.

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:39.900
 Dan, you're free now.

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:40.900
 You can mouth off all sorts of stuff.

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:41.900
 I love anything out of it.

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:42.900
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, absolutely.

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:46.880
 He's been sending me messages of what to say whenever you say something stupid.

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.700
 Oh, we've got some cracking stuff, we've got some great Get Yourself Off the Hooks, we've

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.480
 got some I'm Actuallys of the Week.

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:55.040
 There's some big stuff coming up.

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:56.040
 Right.

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.040
 So let's just...

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:58.040
 Great tease.

00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:59.040
 Let's dive straight in.

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.040
 Yeah, I like that.

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:01.200
 And we'll be back after these messages.

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.920
 Okay, so there's a bit of bonus information or...

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:08.600
 Actually, there are loads of bonus bits of information.

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:09.600
 I'll give this one.

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:10.600
 Okay.

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:11.600
 Let's start with Jennifer Back.

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:15.160
 During your No Such Thing as Proust's Sausage Roll episode a few weeks ago now, you mentioned

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:19.160
 South Korea's Jeju Island and how hotels have professional icebreakers for newlywed

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:20.740
 couples who don't know each other.

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:24.040
 That reminded me of my aunt's wedding video from the late 70s.

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:25.040
 Amazing.

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:30.340
 So Jennifer's mom and one side of her family is Korean and this wedding happened in Korea.

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:31.340
 Right?

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:35.360
 During the reception, there was a dorky, awkward man in a red jacket, like the one in Michael

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.400
 Jackson's Beat It video.

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:38.400
 He was flailing about.

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.320
 So is she talking about Michael Jackson?

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:41.320
 No, no.

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:43.700
 Is there another person who's dorky and...

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:44.700
 During the...

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:45.700
 No, no, no, the jacket.

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:46.700
 Yeah.

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:47.700
 The jacket is similar to Michael Jackson's jacket.

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:48.700
 Oh, not the dorky guy.

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:49.700
 God.

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:50.700
 Sorry, Jennifer.

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.720
 We're actually butchering a really good email.

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:58.000
 This guy wearing a jacket like Michael Jackson's jacket was flailing about vaguely rhythmically

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.320
 on the dance floor.

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:04.000
 It was explained to me that the man was hired so that the older, stuffy or awkward relatives,

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.280
 mostly male, would look at him, think, "Well, I can dance better than that."

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:08.280
 That is genius.

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:10.240
 How they get up on the dance floor?

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:11.640
 That is so clever.

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:12.640
 That's not different.

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:17.200
 We did the fact about every Christmas cracker contains a terrible joke because a terrible

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:19.700
 joke unites people around the table.

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:21.180
 Everyone thinks it sucks.

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:22.780
 This is the physical version of that.

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:26.180
 This guy is the Judas Goat of the wedding dance floor.

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:27.180
 Yeah.

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:28.180
 I wonder if it works.

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:29.180
 I think it is.

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:30.180
 Because that is the problem, isn't it?

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:35.300
 Because I used to work in a hotel and we did lots of weddings and so I've been to more

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:39.540
 weddings than most people because I've worked them and it's the same in all of them that

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:43.540
 no one dances, no one dances, no one dances and then 10 minutes before the end when all

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:47.920
 the people who are working want to go home, suddenly everyone decides, "Oh, let's get

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:49.480
 my dancing shoes on."

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:50.480
 Yeah.

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:51.480
 Well, this is the way forward.

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:52.480
 Amazing.

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:53.480
 Just dance badly.

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:54.480
 How one person dances better.

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:55.480
 I know.

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:56.480
 It's such a good show.

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:58.640
 I wonder if you could set up a whole company whereby you've did multiple things where

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:01.080
 you've injected someone who's crap at it.

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:02.980
 Is that what I'm doing on this show?

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:04.480
 No, no, no.

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:05.480
 Hang on.

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:08.240
 We don't know what you are doing.

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:11.920
 It can't be that.

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:13.180
 I'm listening and think, "You know what?

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:14.180
 I could be a podcast."

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:16.140
 That's why there are so many podcasts.

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:19.140
 That's why everyone's and their mum's got a podcast now.

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:24.220
 We were one of the first podcasts and everyone heard Dan do it and thought, "You know what?

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:25.220
 Rory Stewart."

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:26.540
 He thought I could do that.

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:27.540
 You're welcome, Rory.

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:31.420
 But under this idea, that would mean that I'm actually secretly a genius who's just

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:32.420
 putting this on.

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:33.420
 No, I don't think-

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:34.820
 To make you guys believe that you can do the podcast.

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:35.820
 What did Jennifer say?

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:38.820
 I don't think Jennifer's email says anything about this guy actually being a good dancer.

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:42.080
 Jennifer says he was flailing about on the dance floor.

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:43.560
 I'll do that with my mouth.

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:48.920
 It's not like, "Is this guy naturally a bad dancer or is he like Les Dawson who was actually

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:52.640
 a brilliant pianist but then just pretended to play the piano badly?"

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:53.640
 That's right.

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:54.640
 We don't know.

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:57.400
 This was in the late 70s in Korea, so we may never know whether this guy actually was

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:58.400
 a great dancer.

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:00.640
 But we've got the video.

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:01.640
 She's got the video.

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:04.160
 She said, "I was watching a VHS."

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:05.160
 Yeah.

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:08.800
 Surely, if you gave that to Bruno Tonle only or whatever he's called from Strictly, he would

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:12.220
 be able to look at that person and tell if they would deliberately be in bad or if they

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:13.220
 were actually bad.

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:14.220
 You're absolutely right.

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:15.220
 There is a wedding video.

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:16.220
 You're right then.

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:18.900
 Can she please upload just that guy to YouTube and send it to us?

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:19.900
 Please.

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:20.900
 This is great.

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:21.900
 Yeah.

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:26.440
 Jennifer, if you can be bothered to do that, amazing, but you've already done so much for

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:27.440
 us.

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:28.440
 So thank you.

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:29.440
 Just one more thing, please.

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:30.440
 All right.

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:31.440
 Here's a great one.

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:32.440
 From Michael O.D., right?

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:35.340
 We talked about nicotine and smoking a few weeks ago.

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:36.340
 Okay.

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:37.340
 Yeah.

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:40.840
 We talked with a Swedish company which invented the first nicotine chewing gum, Nicorette.

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:45.520
 It was developed for the Swedish government in order to be used by submariners when they

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:47.560
 banned smoking on board submarines.

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:48.560
 Oh, yeah.

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:51.080
 Because actually we talked about smoking on submarines, didn't we?

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:52.080
 Yeah.

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:53.080
 That's right.

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:54.080
 How interesting.

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:55.080
 How cool is that?

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:56.080
 Yeah, that's really cool.

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:57.080
 Yeah.

00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:01.260
 But one of the problems, obviously, with smoking is making lots of smoke and stuff and that's

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:03.320
 going to be bad for the other people there.

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:05.640
 You're still going to have lots of bits of chewing gum.

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:11.140
 If everyone's eating chewing gum, the bottoms of all the tables are just going to be as

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:12.140
 happy as that.

00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:13.140
 Yeah.

00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:14.140
 Yeah.

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:15.140
 True.

00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:19.100
 Maybe if they eject it out of the back of the torpedo tubes or I'm not completely sure

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:22.500
 where that works, but that could leave a trail, you know?

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:23.500
 Yeah.

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:26.620
 Stick it on the end of the periscope if your enemies can't see out of them.

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:33.020
 I've got a fact about there was an old way of attacking submarines where you would kind

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:37.300
 of take your boat up to where the submarine was, go over to the periscope with a hammer

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:40.300
 and then smash the periscope so they couldn't see out of it.

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:41.300
 That's right.

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:42.300
 Don't know that.

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:43.300
 I love that.

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:44.300
 Yeah.

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:45.620
 They hired people specifically and gave them hammers.

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:46.620
 Yeah.

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:49.660
 And so in the dead of the night, they would go and they would sail close to them.

00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:50.660
 Wow.

00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:51.660
 Isn't that?

00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:54.620
 It's so lo-fi, but actually if you think about it, if you get rid of that, they're completely

00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:55.620
 blind, aren't they?

00:06:55.620 --> 00:06:56.620
 Yeah.

00:06:56.620 --> 00:06:57.620
 Yeah.

00:06:57.620 --> 00:06:58.620
 That's really cool.

00:06:58.620 --> 00:06:59.620
 I also love early submarine stuff.

00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:00.620
 Yeah.

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:01.620
 Yeah.

00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:02.620
 Just siggies and nautical stuff.

00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:03.620
 Yeah.

00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:07.340
 I can't remember which war it was, but they used to be in the channel between France and

00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:08.340
 here.

00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:12.900
 They used to be stationed, huge boys, like these, they were like, they were, Augustus

00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:13.900
 Gloop.

00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:14.900
 Yeah.

00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:18.540
 They were all like mini houses.

00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:19.540
 Like they were one room.

00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:22.340
 We're not allowed to say he's a huge boy anymore, I don't know if you've been reading

00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:23.340
 the news.

00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:24.340
 Boys.

00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:25.340
 Just boys.

00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:26.340
 Yeah.

00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:27.340
 Yeah.

00:07:27.340 --> 00:07:28.340
 Big bald boy.

00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:29.340
 Big bald boy.

00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:32.540
 So if you were a pilot that was flying over and you got on the gun battle and you crashed,

00:07:32.540 --> 00:07:36.220
 this was, I think it was the Germans, they would know that these were stationed along

00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:37.220
 the way.

00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:40.100
 So they could try and make their way in a raft, whatever came out of the plane.

00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:41.100
 Clink to a boy.

00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:43.460
 And inside it would be cigarettes.

00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:45.380
 And inside it would be alcohol.

00:07:45.380 --> 00:07:49.760
 And inside it would be cards so you could play games and stuff until you were picked

00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:50.760
 up.

00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:51.760
 Hang on.

00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:52.760
 Hang on.

00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:53.760
 Someone's taken the little dog.

00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:54.760
 I'm not.

00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:55.760
 This is so annoying.

00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:56.760
 I'm leaving the boy.

00:07:56.760 --> 00:07:57.760
 What?

00:07:57.760 --> 00:07:58.760
 The little dog.

00:07:58.760 --> 00:07:59.760
 The monopoly little dog.

00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:00.760
 Yeah.

00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:01.760
 And what are you saying?

00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:02.760
 Because it's like card games.

00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:03.760
 Card games.

00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:04.760
 No, you're right.

00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:05.760
 Hang on.

00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:06.760
 Where's the three of clubs?

00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:07.760
 Oh, there's no point.

00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:08.760
 Right.

00:08:08.760 --> 00:08:09.760
 I'm sailing back.

00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:10.760
 I'm going in the sea.

00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:11.760
 I'm dancing.

00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:12.760
 And so in the morning, I think it was, they would, or maybe even at night time, you would

00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:13.760
 just do a scoop up.

00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:14.760
 Yeah.

00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:15.760
 They would go and check.

00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:17.120
 They would check all the boys just to see if there were any, you know, fallen soldiers

00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:18.120
 in there.

00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:19.120
 That's really funny.

00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:24.520
 In New Zealand, the islands off New Zealand, they would put goats on there, just put goats

00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:25.520
 on the islands.

00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:26.520
 Yeah.

00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:30.140
 And the idea is that people who, in the age of sail, you're sailing down there,

00:08:30.140 --> 00:08:31.720
 you might get shipwrecked.

00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:34.960
 And if you end up on an island, a goat is a perfect thing because it's going to give

00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:41.000
 you some food with the milk and it's like a service station for, you know, shipwrecked

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:42.000
 people.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.600
 How many islands biodiversity must have been absolutely destroyed?

00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:45.600
 Yeah.

00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:46.600
 Yeah.

00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:47.600
 Yeah.

00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:48.600
 Yeah.

00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:50.600
 Speaking of a biological ravaging, this is a crowbar.

00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:58.600
 Speaking of an unusual trans-global, look, here's Jay McCabe and he says, see if you,

00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:01.300
 or remember immediately what we're talking about, last year, my six-year-old daughter

00:09:01.300 --> 00:09:04.020
 wanted to know if a snail could go around the world.

00:09:04.020 --> 00:09:05.020
 Okay.

00:09:05.020 --> 00:09:10.860
 So this is Andy's idea of, would you rather have a million quid or a snail?

00:09:10.860 --> 00:09:12.180
 It's always chasing you.

00:09:12.180 --> 00:09:13.180
 It's always chasing you.

00:09:13.180 --> 00:09:14.180
 It touches you.

00:09:14.180 --> 00:09:15.180
 Yeah.

00:09:15.180 --> 00:09:16.180
 When it touches you, you die.

00:09:16.180 --> 00:09:17.180
 Yeah.

00:09:17.180 --> 00:09:18.180
 I should say I stole it from the internet.

00:09:18.180 --> 00:09:19.180
 So it's definitely not my thing.

00:09:19.180 --> 00:09:22.660
 Anyway, Jay says, he decided to help his daughter with a bit of logic and with the following,

00:09:22.660 --> 00:09:24.780
 very simplified maths, we came up with the following.

00:09:24.780 --> 00:09:31.100
 So lots of rounding up and down, but basically, he's put in all the maths that they've done.

00:09:31.100 --> 00:09:35.280
 The speed is very rounded to a metre an hour and time travelled in a day is 20 metres based

00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:39.200
 on 19 hours of waking and five hours of sleep, blah, blah, blah.

00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:42.800
 But basically, all you need to do is go between a few locations and the snail will get stuck

00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:46.600
 changing directions because you'll destroy the progress they've made.

00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:50.480
 And did they say what the locations might be or how far apart they would need to be?

00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:51.480
 No.

00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:53.560
 Jay said you don't even need to move countries.

00:09:53.560 --> 00:09:54.560
 Okay.

00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:56.660
 You just have a, you know, go down for a go-for-hotel.

00:09:56.660 --> 00:10:01.180
 If you lived in the Vatican City, if you were the Pope, you would have to move countries.

00:10:01.180 --> 00:10:02.180
 And what a film.

00:10:02.180 --> 00:10:03.180
 What a film.

00:10:03.180 --> 00:10:04.680
 That would be Pope vs. Snail.

00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:05.680
 Cocaine Snail.

00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:10.620
 Man vs. B. They need a sequel for Man vs. B.

00:10:10.620 --> 00:10:13.600
 Pope vs. Snail vs. Cocaine Snail.

00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:16.940
 Oh, that's interesting.

00:10:16.940 --> 00:10:22.820
 I would like to know from their calculations how far you would have to move from different,

00:10:22.820 --> 00:10:27.600
 like if I spent half the year in Bolton and half the year in London, would I be okay?

00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:28.600
 I think you would.

00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:32.280
 If it's 20 metres a day, six months of 20 metres a day isn't going to be...

00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:33.680
 Doesn't feel like a gate to Bolton.

00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:34.680
 No.

00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:38.480
 I'd like to know if the daughter just wanted a whimsical answer or if she had to sit through

00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:42.120
 hours of whiteboard math as she worked this out.

00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:47.460
 Because if it's that version, that she liked the whiteboard stuff, that's a cool kid, man.

00:10:47.460 --> 00:10:50.120
 I don't think I could do that with my kids.

00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:52.120
 So yeah, game on.

00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:54.380
 Michelle Foreman writes, "I've been meaning to write an instance.

00:10:54.380 --> 00:10:57.780
 I listened to the episode where you mentioned a woman was found guilty of murder because

00:10:57.780 --> 00:11:00.180
 the parrot said, 'Don't shoot.'

00:11:00.180 --> 00:11:02.420
 I think in the voice of the murdered man."

00:11:02.420 --> 00:11:06.540
 And we wonder, perhaps she might have been saying, 'Don't shoot.'

00:11:06.540 --> 00:11:08.220
 It might have been altering.

00:11:08.220 --> 00:11:09.460
 Can parrots do voices, basically?

00:11:09.460 --> 00:11:12.660
 And Michelle says, "I can tell you they sure can.

00:11:12.660 --> 00:11:16.820
 Growing up, my friend's stepfather had a parrot named Jasper, a Congo gray.

00:11:16.820 --> 00:11:21.500
 And Jasper could mimic every member of the family from my friend to her mother to her

00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:22.500
 stepdad.

00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:26.600
 More than once, we thought we were being scolded by a parent when it was just Jasper looking

00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:27.600
 for attention."

00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:28.600
 Cool.

00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:29.600
 How good is that?

00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:30.600
 That is good.

00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:31.600
 Thank you, Michelle.

00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:38.360
 If you could get them to do famous people, and instead of John Cullshaw, you'd just have

00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:40.560
 a parrot doing a load of impressions of people.

00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:41.560
 That would be a good...

00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:47.880
 Because I think they try to bring back spitting image, and it did okay, but I didn't do...

00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:48.880
 Well, it's in the West End now.

00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:49.880
 It's got a big shirt.

00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:50.880
 Right.

00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:51.880
 But if you did it with parrots...

00:11:51.880 --> 00:11:52.880
 How much better would it be?

00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:57.300
 So if you dressed them in little wigs and so on, and they're like, "Yeah, I think that's

00:11:57.300 --> 00:11:58.640
 an amazing idea."

00:11:58.640 --> 00:11:59.960
 How many words can they...

00:11:59.960 --> 00:12:00.960
 They're quite short skits.

00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:01.960
 Yeah.

00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:02.960
 No, they can do it.

00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:03.960
 I'm sure they can do a few hundred words.

00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:04.960
 Can they?

00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:07.800
 But all the celebrities want a cracker.

00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:08.800
 Yes.

00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:11.900
 A bit of an "I'm actually" from Catherine Wall.

00:12:11.900 --> 00:12:12.900
 Okay, come on then.

00:12:12.900 --> 00:12:13.900
 Loving the episode.

00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:14.900
 So those are...

00:12:14.900 --> 00:12:17.020
 It's going to be a criticism sandwich here.

00:12:17.020 --> 00:12:20.520
 So that also sounds like she's pressed pause on an episode.

00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:22.440
 She's so furious about what she's going to write.

00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:26.360
 Oh, do you know, I think this is the dropper's line of a dropper's a line.

00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:31.040
 I think this is something I said in a dropper's a line, or in a bonus.

00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:35.320
 In fact, I think it was someone else sent in this fact, and it's now been corrected by

00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:36.920
 someone else within another dropper's a line.

00:12:36.920 --> 00:12:37.920
 So we've developed our own eco.

00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:38.920
 It's like a terrarium.

00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:39.920
 Oh, got it.

00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:40.920
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:12:40.920 --> 00:12:41.920
 You know what I mean?

00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:42.920
 Where it's its own contained microclimate.

00:12:42.920 --> 00:12:43.920
 Yeah.

00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:47.620
 So the fact was about when the longest day is, and it was stated that it was in October.

00:12:47.620 --> 00:12:48.620
 Oh, yes.

00:12:48.620 --> 00:12:49.620
 The cops go back.

00:12:49.620 --> 00:12:50.620
 Yeah.

00:12:50.620 --> 00:12:51.620
 It was dropper's a line.

00:12:51.620 --> 00:12:52.620
 It was.

00:12:52.620 --> 00:12:55.460
 This is true for places in the Northern Hemisphere who adopt daylight saving in October, but

00:12:55.460 --> 00:12:59.300
 in Australia, the states that adopt daylight saving have the longest day in April.

00:12:59.300 --> 00:13:01.780
 And not everywhere adopts daylight saving.

00:13:01.780 --> 00:13:02.780
 As this fact is...

00:13:02.780 --> 00:13:05.660
 And then there's the other end of the praise, the criticism sandwich.

00:13:05.660 --> 00:13:09.260
 As this fact isn't universally true, I think it makes an awesome QI fact.

00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:14.060
 So I would argue it completely invalidates it as a fact, but thank you.

00:13:14.060 --> 00:13:15.060
 Anna said it wasn't a fact.

00:13:15.060 --> 00:13:16.060
 Oh, no, she said it was a fact.

00:13:16.060 --> 00:13:17.060
 She said it wasn't interesting.

00:13:17.060 --> 00:13:18.060
 Who?

00:13:18.060 --> 00:13:19.060
 Yeah.

00:13:19.060 --> 00:13:24.560
 I couldn't believe you were so angry about that, Andy, that you just said, "No more.

00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:29.400
 We're going to have to make up a story about her being pregnant."

00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:30.560
 Got my way.

00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:31.920
 We actually got center fact that was met.

00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:35.460
 I think we've already mentioned on the show, which was, I just wanted to give a shout out

00:13:35.460 --> 00:13:37.240
 because I don't think I named actually the person who sent it.

00:13:37.240 --> 00:13:41.420
 We got an email from Andreas Marti, and the subject line of the email was Gibbon glory

00:13:41.420 --> 00:13:42.420
 whole action.

00:13:42.420 --> 00:13:43.420
 Oh, yeah.

00:13:43.420 --> 00:13:47.220
 I think we just mentioned that on a show with, was it the one with Sarah or with Monica,

00:13:47.220 --> 00:13:48.220
 maybe?

00:13:48.220 --> 00:13:49.660
 No, it was the one with Monica, which hasn't gone out yet.

00:13:49.660 --> 00:13:50.660
 Oh, yeah.

00:13:50.660 --> 00:13:56.220
 Oh, well, you'll have to wait to see what the Gibbon glory whole action is all about.

00:13:56.220 --> 00:13:57.220
 That's a proper teaser.

00:13:57.220 --> 00:13:58.220
 Yeah.

00:13:58.220 --> 00:14:01.900
 We need to change our email filter as well because nothing headlined Gibbon glory whole

00:14:01.900 --> 00:14:04.020
 action should be getting into the inbox.

00:14:04.020 --> 00:14:05.980
 Well, you clicked on it.

00:14:05.980 --> 00:14:06.980
 You opened it.

00:14:06.980 --> 00:14:07.980
 Yeah.

00:14:07.980 --> 00:14:11.160
 And I was sorely disappointed by a factual story on the inside.

00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:12.160
 Yeah.

00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:16.880
 So if you want Andy to read your emails, then give it a nice title.

00:14:16.880 --> 00:14:17.880
 Filf.

00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:18.880
 Yeah.

00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:19.880
 It's what we need.

00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:20.880
 Yeah.

00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:21.880
 Right.

00:14:21.880 --> 00:14:22.880
 We're going to have to come to the big get yourself off the hook of this drop as a line.

00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:23.880
 Oh, okay.

00:14:23.880 --> 00:14:24.880
 Right.

00:14:24.880 --> 00:14:25.880
 Sender of email.

00:14:25.880 --> 00:14:26.880
 Alexander Pinkerton.

00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:27.880
 Subject line.

00:14:27.880 --> 00:14:28.880
 Bring it on bassoon boy.

00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:36.560
 So, Dan, would you like to just briefly explain, and I should say this isn't the only email

00:14:36.560 --> 00:14:38.180
 we've had.

00:14:38.180 --> 00:14:41.780
 Bring it on.

00:14:41.780 --> 00:14:47.060
 We were talking about Ethel Smythe and the fact and she was a composer who used to tie

00:14:47.060 --> 00:14:51.420
 herself to a tree to get posture better so that she could conduct better when she was

00:14:51.420 --> 00:14:52.420
 doing that.

00:14:52.420 --> 00:14:56.780
 There was a story where she really didn't like the orchestra and how they were playing

00:14:56.780 --> 00:14:57.780
 her piece.

00:14:57.780 --> 00:15:01.100
 So she went around and picked up all the sheet music and fled the country so they weren't

00:15:01.100 --> 00:15:02.620
 able to play it.

00:15:02.620 --> 00:15:08.360
 I argued that why is it that you never see anyone who's part of an orchestra able to

00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:11.920
 just play the pieces without the sheet music?

00:15:11.920 --> 00:15:12.920
 Surely.

00:15:12.920 --> 00:15:14.080
 'Cause Cole play do it.

00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:15.080
 Cole play do it.

00:15:15.080 --> 00:15:16.080
 Springsteen.

00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:17.080
 Springsteen.

00:15:17.080 --> 00:15:18.080
 Springsteen does it.

00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:19.080
 Yep.

00:15:19.080 --> 00:15:20.080
 Blink182 can do it.

00:15:20.080 --> 00:15:22.400
 It's not hard, guys.

00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:28.720
 And yeah, I put that out there and it's had apparently some response.

00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:31.440
 There's been some response.

00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:35.880
 And the Pinkerton's email is amazing, but it's so long and so detailed that we can't

00:15:35.880 --> 00:15:37.120
 read the whole thing.

00:15:37.120 --> 00:15:42.140
 But basically he studies the complexity of the music, such as the sort of stuff played

00:15:42.140 --> 00:15:51.240
 by 816 Bar Blues on the E Street Band versus Rachmaninoff's Third Piano Concerto.

00:15:51.240 --> 00:15:54.980
 The conclusion is that in less than a third of the time, so the Rachmaninoff Concerto

00:15:54.980 --> 00:15:59.500
 is a third of the length, but there are double as many pieces of phrasing in it.

00:15:59.500 --> 00:16:05.080
 And also, the boss Springsteen has the benefit of being able to play the music, which came

00:16:05.080 --> 00:16:06.720
 into his own head without sheet guidance.

00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:09.040
 He could probably improvise for more than three hours, but he's been playing the same

00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:11.040
 material for five decades.

00:16:11.040 --> 00:16:12.040
 And Alexander says-

00:16:12.040 --> 00:16:14.120
 Wait, hang on, hang on, hang on.

00:16:14.120 --> 00:16:16.040
 Any one of us can learn a Bruce Springsteen.

00:16:16.040 --> 00:16:17.040
 We could learn-

00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:18.040
 Are you digging here, Dan?

00:16:18.040 --> 00:16:21.800
 I'm just saying, you can't argue when the music came to him.

00:16:21.800 --> 00:16:24.120
 You're using the originator of that song in that circumstance.

00:16:24.120 --> 00:16:25.120
 Okay.

00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:26.120
 A lot of people cover his songs.

00:16:26.120 --> 00:16:27.120
 Okay, well, in that case-

00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:28.120
 They don't do it with sheet music.

00:16:28.120 --> 00:16:30.040
 We should go on to the email from Kate Dunstan.

00:16:30.040 --> 00:16:36.120
 I am a bassoonist, she says, and have played most of the classical repertoire and can say

00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:39.640
 that you don't want to learn that stuff from memory, thousands of bars of different notes

00:16:39.640 --> 00:16:44.640
 with different rhythms, keys, not chords, she says, with different rhythms, key signatures,

00:16:44.640 --> 00:16:47.240
 time signatures, and bars of rest when you don't play.

00:16:47.240 --> 00:16:50.560
 Most wind instruments can only play one note at a time and therefore can't play chords.

00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:53.920
 So actually, you can't even learn the chords for these things because there aren't chords.

00:16:53.920 --> 00:16:57.200
 She says, I have to concede that when I perform solo recital pieces, I do like to play those

00:16:57.200 --> 00:16:59.800
 from memory, but this takes hundreds of hours of practice.

00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:00.800
 So it's doable.

00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:01.800
 Okay.

00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:02.800
 You're really digging in.

00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:08.400
 So we're going to have to go to the third email from Randall Peters for crying out loud

00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:09.400
 there.

00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:10.400
 Come on, Randall.

00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:11.400
 Go to a classical concert sometime.

00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:13.440
 Do you think the players are all jamming on a chord?

00:17:13.440 --> 00:17:18.160
 I also happen to be a composer of orchestral music, including three operas.

00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:20.800
 I wish everyone in an orchestra could fake their way through a piece of music, but it's

00:17:20.800 --> 00:17:22.240
 incredibly complex.

00:17:22.240 --> 00:17:23.360
 Everyone has their own intricate part of play.

00:17:23.360 --> 00:17:25.280
 The notation is very specific.

00:17:25.280 --> 00:17:27.080
 Let's not pretend they should know all the chords.

00:17:27.080 --> 00:17:28.520
 Sometimes we don't even have chords.

00:17:28.520 --> 00:17:30.200
 Use that as a fact.

00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:33.960
 I've attached a PDF of the first violin part for a 30-minute orchestra piece of mine.

00:17:33.960 --> 00:17:38.120
 I respect, says Randall, for any self-demeaning attempt at a joke, but up with this, I will

00:17:38.120 --> 00:17:39.120
 not put.

00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:41.840
 Please don't dig in because I'll get more emails and no one has to read those out,

00:17:41.840 --> 00:17:42.840
 right?

00:17:42.840 --> 00:17:47.080
 What I'm being forced to do here is to admit that I was joking, which really pisses me

00:17:47.080 --> 00:17:48.080
 off.

00:17:48.080 --> 00:17:50.360
 Anyway, thank you everyone for your correspondence.

00:17:50.360 --> 00:17:51.360
 It was a brilliant time.

00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:54.960
 It's my favourite slamming I've had from a group of people in my life.

00:17:54.960 --> 00:17:56.280
 I just love that we've had a composer.

00:17:56.280 --> 00:17:57.280
 We've had a bassoonist.

00:17:57.280 --> 00:17:58.280
 We've had all sorts of people.

00:17:58.280 --> 00:17:59.280
 Yeah, yeah.

00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:00.280
 You know, it's very flattering.

00:18:00.280 --> 00:18:01.280
 I'm sorry.

00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:02.280
 I'm sorry I upset so many people.

00:18:02.280 --> 00:18:07.440
 I reckon there's one conductor who's getting all these emails sent at one time going, "Bassoon

00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:08.440
 sent yours.

00:18:08.440 --> 00:18:11.960
 First violin sent yours."

00:18:11.960 --> 00:18:13.760
 Can I just say, though, one last thing.

00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:14.760
 No, we've got so much more to get through.

00:18:14.760 --> 00:18:16.880
 I'm not saying it's like a Springsteen song.

00:18:16.880 --> 00:18:18.640
 I'm saying they are all notes.

00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:21.600
 They are all things that you play and they're at work and they're memorised.

00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:24.160
 I'm not saying it's less or more complex.

00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:25.760
 It's obviously more complex.

00:18:25.760 --> 00:18:26.960
 It's a classical piece.

00:18:26.960 --> 00:18:27.960
 I know that.

00:18:27.960 --> 00:18:31.920
 Well, I'll give the last word to Alexander who says, "It is more impressive from a purely

00:18:31.920 --> 00:18:36.120
 technical standpoint to see a 25-year-old soloist smash out a piece of incredibly complex

00:18:36.120 --> 00:18:40.480
 music from memory than it is for an old rocker to do three hours of their back catalogue.

00:18:40.480 --> 00:18:45.200
 Which of those is cooler is not an argument I want to engage with."

00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:46.200
 Which is fair enough.

00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:47.600
 I've got to get myself off a hook here.

00:18:47.600 --> 00:18:48.600
 Okay.

00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:52.800
 Dave Reinersman writes, "I'd like to offer a defence of Andy's boring facts."

00:18:52.800 --> 00:18:53.920
 Hang on.

00:18:53.920 --> 00:18:59.760
 I know you curate these things, but I sort of feel a bit put out that you've had me

00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:02.520
 ruined and now you're going to defend yourself.

00:19:02.520 --> 00:19:03.520
 It's not me defending myself.

00:19:03.520 --> 00:19:04.520
 It's Dave Reinersman.

00:19:04.520 --> 00:19:05.520
 Thank you, Dave.

00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:06.520
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:19:06.520 --> 00:19:10.680
 Dave is just saying that, you know, often if you look at something, a seemingly dull

00:19:10.680 --> 00:19:12.920
 fact that will have depth and curiosities on closer inspection.

00:19:12.920 --> 00:19:14.800
 But not this case.

00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:17.320
 And it just happens to be.

00:19:17.320 --> 00:19:19.080
 What was he referring to?

00:19:19.080 --> 00:19:20.720
 Just to my boring facts, apparently.

00:19:20.720 --> 00:19:21.720
 This is an overall comment.

00:19:21.720 --> 00:19:26.400
 I think I've had a run of them recently where I've talked about trams or about ... Yeah.

00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:30.240
 But Dave says, "Not to make this too grand a statement, but it's that humbling perspective

00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:33.440
 on the world that has kept me coming back to the QI media empire for so long."

00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:34.440
 So I guess.

00:19:34.440 --> 00:19:35.440
 Get you've saved.

00:19:35.440 --> 00:19:36.440
 You're welcome.

00:19:36.440 --> 00:19:37.440
 Yeah.

00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:38.440
 All right.

00:19:38.440 --> 00:19:42.680
 I'll give you a proper one where I've ... There's a proper one where I might have made a boo-boo.

00:19:42.680 --> 00:19:43.680
 Bill Sheffield.

00:19:43.680 --> 00:19:44.680
 Yeah.

00:19:44.680 --> 00:19:45.680
 Great name.

00:19:45.680 --> 00:19:47.080
 It seems odd to me that you spoke about the reason that TVs are so cheap now is that they

00:19:47.080 --> 00:19:50.840
 figured out how to cut more screens out of the mother glass, which we did say.

00:19:50.840 --> 00:19:54.800
 The reason TVs are so cheap now is that they used to depend on the cathode ray technology

00:19:54.800 --> 00:19:58.800
 where the image was created by a cathode ray gun shooting electrons onto a curved glass

00:19:58.800 --> 00:19:59.800
 surface.

00:19:59.800 --> 00:20:02.320
 Effectively a particle accelerator cathode ray gun.

00:20:02.320 --> 00:20:08.840
 So the cathode ray tube, or maybe the screen, was curved both up and down and across, much

00:20:08.840 --> 00:20:14.680
 like a Pringle, meaning each TV screen needed to be blown molded one at a time.

00:20:14.680 --> 00:20:15.680
 Yes.

00:20:15.680 --> 00:20:16.680
 No, that's fair.

00:20:16.680 --> 00:20:21.880
 Although, I thought that the ... I don't want to start defending things, but I thought

00:20:21.880 --> 00:20:26.360
 the point was, even since we got flat screens, they're getting cheaper and cheaper, right?

00:20:26.360 --> 00:20:32.120
 I think that is it, but Bill is also absolutely right that, and he says, figuring out how to

00:20:32.120 --> 00:20:35.520
 cut more screens from the mother glass is not as big a deal as having a flat screen in

00:20:35.520 --> 00:20:39.040
 the first place, which is completely fair, and I accept that.

00:20:39.040 --> 00:20:40.400
 I forgot about the mother glass.

00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:43.240
 That's one of those facts that I hope I continue to forget and hear about, because it's just

00:20:43.240 --> 00:20:48.000
 such a fun idea, like learning that new for the first time is just a such a wonderful

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:49.000
 thought.

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:50.000
 Yeah, absolutely.

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:51.000
 A couple more?

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:52.000
 Yeah.

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:55.640
 Lena Nilsson, this is ... Do you remember the nutmeg thing we talked about?

00:20:55.640 --> 00:20:57.360
 This is an Anna thing, where Anna ...

00:20:57.360 --> 00:21:02.520
 She ate a load of nutmeg that, no, her husband made something with some nutmeg in, and she

00:21:02.520 --> 00:21:04.960
 made herself vomit because she thought it was poisonous.

00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:05.960
 That's right.

00:21:05.960 --> 00:21:10.320
 Or it wasn't also that she let him eat it, as in she tested him out, but didn't tell

00:21:10.320 --> 00:21:11.320
 him.

00:21:11.320 --> 00:21:12.320
 Yeah.

00:21:12.320 --> 00:21:13.720
 That's a good fact from Lena Nilsson.

00:21:13.720 --> 00:21:18.320
 In 2008, a Swedish cooking magazine called Matmagazinet had to issue an apology after

00:21:18.320 --> 00:21:22.960
 a family experienced rapid heartbeats, excessive sweating, etc., from eating the world's tastiest

00:21:22.960 --> 00:21:26.080
 apple cake.

00:21:26.080 --> 00:21:27.580
 That actually feels worth it.

00:21:27.580 --> 00:21:33.040
 If it's the world's tastiest apple cake, I think I would be willing to eat the world's

00:21:33.040 --> 00:21:36.160
 tastiest apple cake for a few heart palpitations.

00:21:36.160 --> 00:21:37.160
 Fair enough.

00:21:37.160 --> 00:21:39.000
 Well, here's what had happened, as Lena says.

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:45.320
 The recipe had accidentally listed the amount of ground nutmeg as 20 nutmegs, instead of

00:21:45.320 --> 00:21:46.320
 two milliliters.

00:21:46.320 --> 00:21:47.320
 Oh my God.

00:21:47.320 --> 00:21:48.320
 20 nutmegs.

00:21:48.320 --> 00:21:52.560
 They quickly withdrew the issue when they discovered the mistake, but apparently one

00:21:52.560 --> 00:21:56.680
 family had already bought it and didn't react with any suspicion to the absurd amount of

00:21:56.680 --> 00:21:57.960
 poisonous spice.

00:21:57.960 --> 00:22:00.640
 So did they have to ... They made it, right?

00:22:00.640 --> 00:22:01.640
 They made it.

00:22:01.640 --> 00:22:03.800
 So they had to grate all these nutmegs, I guess.

00:22:03.800 --> 00:22:04.800
 Yes.

00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:05.800
 Right?

00:22:05.800 --> 00:22:06.800
 Oh my God.

00:22:06.800 --> 00:22:07.800
 I mean, that would have taken an hour, at least.

00:22:07.800 --> 00:22:11.120
 The editor-in-chief said we didn't think it was possible to eat a cake like that, since

00:22:11.120 --> 00:22:14.080
 it would be terribly bitter, but it turned out one group did that anyway.

00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:15.080
 Wow.

00:22:15.080 --> 00:22:16.080
 What's what happened to them, sorry?

00:22:16.080 --> 00:22:20.000
 They were fine, but I think they had some sweating and palpitations and heartbeats,

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:21.560
 but I think they were all right.

00:22:21.560 --> 00:22:22.560
 That's really funny.

00:22:22.560 --> 00:22:23.560
 Isn't that great?

00:22:23.560 --> 00:22:24.560
 Thank you, Lena.

00:22:24.560 --> 00:22:25.560
 One last one.

00:22:25.560 --> 00:22:26.560
 Okay.

00:22:26.560 --> 00:22:27.560
 This is from David McLaren.

00:22:27.560 --> 00:22:28.560
 Okay.

00:22:28.560 --> 00:22:34.720
 Long time listener, writing in because I have a tidbit regarding a slip-up Andy made regarding

00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:36.360
 the treatment for the two-headed turtle.

00:22:36.360 --> 00:22:37.680
 Do you remember this?

00:22:37.680 --> 00:22:39.560
 Oh, gosh, this is a long time ago.

00:22:39.560 --> 00:22:40.560
 A couple of months ago.

00:22:40.560 --> 00:22:41.560
 Yeah, we talked about this.

00:22:41.560 --> 00:22:43.880
 There's the two-headed turtle, and the two heads prefer different foods.

00:22:43.880 --> 00:22:44.880
 Yeah.

00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:46.640
 And they would sometimes fight over lettuce leaves as well.

00:22:46.640 --> 00:22:47.640
 Bingo.

00:22:47.640 --> 00:22:48.640
 Yeah, yeah.

00:22:48.640 --> 00:22:49.640
 Oh, yeah.

00:22:49.640 --> 00:22:53.640
 And I made a mistake because I said they treat the turtle's heads by applying valium

00:22:53.640 --> 00:22:55.440
 to them, and I meant Vaseline.

00:22:55.440 --> 00:22:56.440
 That's right.

00:22:56.440 --> 00:22:57.440
 I remember that.

00:22:57.440 --> 00:23:02.320
 Andy mistakenly said, "Valium diazepam is applied to their heads when he meant Vaseline."

00:23:02.320 --> 00:23:04.400
 Surprisingly, Dan was the one to correct this.

00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:07.800
 I'm just reading David's.

00:23:07.800 --> 00:23:11.040
 Thank you, David, for qualifying that.

00:23:11.040 --> 00:23:17.360
 But as David says, "When I was working as a hospital pharmacist, I prepared a diazepam

00:23:17.360 --> 00:23:22.080
 vaginal suppository for a patient."

00:23:22.080 --> 00:23:25.680
 First I was convinced I was misreading the script, but it's not common, and there are

00:23:25.680 --> 00:23:32.040
 multiple studies looking at the topical application of diazepam, valium, and it can actually be

00:23:32.040 --> 00:23:34.920
 useful for a variety of issues, not just anxiety.

00:23:34.920 --> 00:23:35.920
 Yeah.

00:23:35.920 --> 00:23:37.920
 So maybe I was right.

00:23:37.920 --> 00:23:40.000
 Maybe what he seems to be saying.

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:41.000
 Yeah, yeah.

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:46.160
 But there's a difference between a turtle's head and a vagina.

00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:47.160
 Absolutely.

00:23:47.160 --> 00:23:49.160
 That's an uncontroversial statement.

00:23:49.160 --> 00:23:50.160
 I don't know.

00:23:50.160 --> 00:23:51.160
 We'll get lettuce next week.

00:23:51.160 --> 00:23:52.160
 Yes, sir.

00:23:52.160 --> 00:23:53.160
 I'm a turtle keeper.

00:23:53.160 --> 00:23:54.160
 I'm pervert.

00:23:54.160 --> 00:24:07.320
 They're not going to show you.

00:24:07.320 --> 00:24:12.840
 They are very easily mixed up.

00:24:12.840 --> 00:24:13.840
 Oh, dear.

00:24:13.840 --> 00:24:14.840
 Yeah.

00:24:14.840 --> 00:24:15.840
 I just thought it was interesting.

00:24:15.840 --> 00:24:18.040
 I didn't know you could get diazepam vaginal suppositories.

00:24:18.040 --> 00:24:19.040
 That is really interesting.

00:24:19.040 --> 00:24:20.040
 That is surprising.

00:24:20.040 --> 00:24:23.720
 I didn't know you got any suppositories that went anywhere but up the bottom.

00:24:23.720 --> 00:24:26.440
 Oh, well, they're colpesteries, aren't they, if they're--

00:24:26.440 --> 00:24:27.440
 Oh, no.

00:24:27.440 --> 00:24:28.440
 I suppose they are.

00:24:28.440 --> 00:24:29.440
 No, I think you're right.

00:24:29.440 --> 00:24:30.440
 I think they are.

00:24:30.440 --> 00:24:31.440
 Yeah.

00:24:31.440 --> 00:24:32.440
 Well.

00:24:32.440 --> 00:24:33.440
 Maybe he put it in the wrong colp.

00:24:33.440 --> 00:24:36.440
 Oh, gosh.

00:24:36.440 --> 00:24:37.440
 Oh.

00:24:37.440 --> 00:24:38.440
 Bye.

00:24:38.440 --> 00:24:41.480
 Thanks so much, everyone, for listening.

00:24:41.480 --> 00:24:43.000
 That was great fun.

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:46.480
