00:00:07,00:00:08,"""Did you know with it?"""
00:00:08,00:00:20,"Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly bogguss coming to you from the Kiwai Offices in Covent Garden."
00:00:20,00:00:26,"My name is Lightning and I'm sitting here with James Harkin, Anatozhinsky and Alex Bell."
00:00:26,00:00:31,"And once again, we've gathered around the microphones and we've got you our four favourite facts in the last seven days."
00:00:31,00:00:39,"So in no particular order, here we go, starting this week with my fact, and that is that early ice skating rinks stink of pig fat."
00:00:39,00:00:41,- What? - It's a rank rink.
00:00:41,00:00:50,"- Rank rink, ice rink. - So this is the fact that the very first artificial skating rinks used as kind of ice substitute,"
00:00:50,00:00:55,because they didn't have the technology to make proper fake ice.
00:00:55,00:01:04,"So instead, they used a substitute which consisted of various salts and hoglard and people would skate around on it."
00:01:04,00:01:07,And they also had mounds of hoglard just at the side to look like fake snow.
00:01:07,00:01:11,"Yeah, and it didn't last very long. It lasted six or seven months."
00:01:11,00:01:14,- When did you say that was? - That was in 1844.
00:01:14,00:01:18,"Okay, so that was, and the first one of those was made in 1841, I think, wasn't it?"
00:01:18,00:01:22,"- Yes, sorry. So this was the first one that was properly open to the public."
00:01:22,00:01:27,"- Yeah, the one that was made in 1841 was only six foot by 12 foot, so I don't think."
00:01:27,00:01:29,"- You're not going to play much hockey on that, I mean."
00:01:29,00:01:36,"- That was like his investment lure at one. So he made that first one, and it was basically like the thing you'd take on Dragon's Den to say,"
00:01:36,00:01:40,"""If you give me Â£10,000 for 10% of the company."""
00:01:40,00:01:44,"- Well, I'm afraid it smells like pig fat, so I'm out."
00:01:44,00:01:47,- It's weird when you see pictures of the olden days.
00:01:47,00:01:52,"So for instance, there's this beautiful picture of one of these early ice rinks from the 1840s,"
00:01:52,00:01:58,"and everyone always looks very kind of, they're all dressed very beautifully, and it always looks lovely, like Jane Austen era,"
00:01:58,00:02:02,"and you can never see the picture of the smell, which was so privated everywhere."
00:02:02,00:02:05,Everything smell of horse manure or pig fat.
00:02:05,00:02:10,- Did you expect that they'd be skating around with like clothes pegs on their noses or stuff like that?
00:02:10,00:02:13,"- Green smoke, lingering above them."
00:02:13,00:02:17,"- Yeah, you can't see the trotters poking up through the ice."
00:02:17,00:02:21,"- Do you remember last year when in Japan, I think we might have mentioned this on our new show in Japan,"
00:02:21,00:02:25,"they filled that ice rink with dead fish, didn't they?"
00:02:25,00:02:27,They got like panties with a dead fish.
00:02:27,00:02:32,"- I look this up again, but I didn't realise at the time when you did this on the show that the Japanese theme park"
00:02:32,00:02:34,"is called Space World, and it's like a space themed theme park."
00:02:34,00:02:37,There's no reason to put fish inside your ice rink.
00:02:37,00:02:42,"- They froze them fast so that you get a kind of whole shoulder fish mid-swim, so it did look quite cool,"
00:02:42,00:02:45,"but then they also spelt out the word ""hello"" and dead fish."
00:02:45,00:02:48,"- When you take a step back from that, that's like, what are you doing?"
00:02:48,00:02:52,"Who thought that was a good idea, how far down the meeting did you lose sight that that was mad"
00:02:52,00:02:56,"when you were like, let's spell out the word ""hello"" of all words in the ice?"
00:02:56,00:02:58,"- At the very least, you could put ""hello"" in Japanese."
00:02:58,00:02:59,"- Oh, was it in English?"
00:02:59,00:03:01,"- Yeah, it wasn't English, wasn't it?"
00:03:01,00:03:01,"- It was, yeah."
00:03:01,00:03:03,"- But they got a massive trouble over that, and then they said, don't worry,"
00:03:03,00:03:09,the fish were already dead before we put them in the ice as though that sort of makes it better.
00:03:09,00:03:13,"- Well, it kind of makes it better, because then it's just like if they were just buying it up as if to eat."
00:03:13,00:03:17,"- But people complained at the time that the fish looked like they'd been frozen in time,"
00:03:17,00:03:19,"they were people saying, it looks like you've just put them in there alive,"
00:03:19,00:03:23,"and they've frozen to death, because their mouths are open and their eyes are big and wide."
00:03:23,00:03:26,"But if you've ever been to a fishmonger, that is just what dead fish look like."
00:03:26,00:03:28,"- I see what you mean, I don't think it's better, I do think it's less bad."
00:03:28,00:03:29,"- Well, that's what that means."
00:03:29,00:03:32,"- Well, I think it's still bad."
00:03:32,00:03:34,"- Do you think, because it was spelled out in English, maybe they thought"
00:03:34,00:03:37,"this is a kind of weird stuff that the Brits are into, isn't it?"
00:03:37,00:03:40,"We'll spell it out in their language, we'll get loads of tourists."
00:03:40,00:03:44,"- Well, they correctly surmised that it was going to be in British tabloid newspapers, didn't they?"
00:03:44,00:03:45,"- They did, well done, Japan."
00:03:45,00:03:48,"- Yeah, maybe they were hoping that it was going to be in Hello Magazine."
00:03:48,00:03:53,Maybe it was sponsored by Hello Magazine.
00:03:53,00:03:58,"- Anyway, yeah, so they didn't have another proper artificial ice rink until 1876,"
00:03:58,00:04:00,and that was when they had actually developed the technology.
00:04:00,00:04:03,But even that one had a layer of cow hair under the ice.
00:04:03,00:04:05,- Did it?
00:04:05,00:04:07,Was that for some kind of sort of cold insulation?
00:04:07,00:04:10,"Because they ran cold types under the ice, didn't they?"
00:04:10,00:04:13,"- You had concrete, the base layer is concrete, and then on top of that,"
00:04:13,00:04:16,"you have layers of earth and wood and cow hair, obviously."
00:04:16,00:04:17,"And then they, on top of that, as you say,"
00:04:17,00:04:20,"and they put these pipes, and they ran a chemical solution through the pipes,"
00:04:20,00:04:25,"which froze the water surrounding the pipes, and it froze the water."
00:04:25,00:04:26,"- Yeah, what was that?"
00:04:26,00:04:26,- That was really cool.
00:04:26,00:04:28,"- They were called Galiciaerians, weren't they?"
00:04:28,00:04:29,- Yeah.
00:04:29,00:04:30,"- Galiciaeria, maybe."
00:04:30,00:04:31,But they were incredible.
00:04:31,00:04:35,"I didn't realise these things existed, and they were, it sounds amazing."
00:04:35,00:04:36,So they were floating.
00:04:36,00:04:41,"There was, I think the second or the third one that this guy, John Gange, who invented them made,"
00:04:41,00:04:44,"was one, a floating one on the tenths, just where the hunger for bridges."
00:04:44,00:04:49,"So it was this big floating ice rink, and it had a glass ceiling that went all over it."
00:04:49,00:04:51,"So it was indoors, glass ceilinged, floating."
00:04:51,00:04:52,Why don't we still have this?
00:04:52,00:04:53,- That's very cool.
00:04:53,00:04:54,- Yeah.
00:04:54,00:04:57,"- I find it fun enough to skate on an ice rink that's on solid ground,"
00:04:57,00:05:00,"but one that's also, like, you get a seasick on as well, let's go out and down."
00:05:00,00:05:01,- Maybe it cancels out.
00:05:01,00:05:02,- And it's just like walking around.
00:05:02,00:05:05,"- I think I'm imagining everybody sliding to one end,"
00:05:05,00:05:08,"and then sliding to the other end, and always getting bunched up on one side."
00:05:08,00:05:09,- Yeah.
00:05:09,00:05:13,"So John Gange, then, after doing this, he went into perpetual motion."
00:05:13,00:05:20,"He invented a thing called the Xerometer, which supposedly would power ships through perpetual motion."
00:05:20,00:05:25,"He put the same, a similar kind of liquid through the ship, which is really cold."
00:05:25,00:05:27,That would take the heat from the water.
00:05:27,00:05:33,"That would propel the sails and the rotors, which would then put energy back into the water."
00:05:33,00:05:37,"And that would supposedly be a perpetual motion machine, unfortunately, it didn't work."
00:05:37,00:05:40,"- Unfortunately, he didn't count on the laws of physics."
00:05:40,00:05:43,- And he spent the rest of his life and all of his money on that.
00:05:43,00:05:45,- You're calm.
00:05:45,00:05:45,- Yeah.
00:05:45,00:05:49,"- He was an extremely accomplished vet, John Gange."
00:05:49,00:05:52,So he was really good at this.
00:05:52,00:05:55,He founded this vet school and a vet journal.
00:05:55,00:05:59,"And there's now the John Gange award, which is basically the only remnant that has his name,"
00:05:59,00:06:03,which is an award that's given to those who excel in the field of veterinary science.
00:06:03,00:06:07,- And it says in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography that if he'd have carried on
00:06:07,00:06:12,"being a vet instead of going into ice skating rinks and perpetual motion,"
00:06:12,00:06:16,"then he probably would have been the best vet of all time, maybe, or one of the best vets."
00:06:16,00:06:21,"- But we wouldn't have ice rinks, so swings and roundabouts, isn't it?"
00:06:21,00:06:24,- But we would have the pig rink still. He didn't invent that.
00:06:24,00:06:26,"- We'd still have the pig rink, thank God."
00:06:26,00:06:27,- So that would be probably fine.
00:06:27,00:06:33,- Can I just cause such a cool thing about Gange is that his brother was a guy called Sampson Gange.
00:06:33,00:06:34,- Samp Gange?
00:06:34,00:06:41,"- Well, so Sampson Gange was a doctor, and he invented a kind of tissue that was used in"
00:06:41,00:06:44,"surgical instruments, which people called the Gange tissue."
00:06:44,00:06:48,"But Tolkien wrote a letter saying that he'd got the name Samwise Gange from that,"
00:06:48,00:06:51,because they used to refer to the Gange tissue at the end of the 19th century.
00:06:51,00:06:56,"And it was to go with Rosie Cotton, who's Samwise Gange's wife in Lord of the Rings."
00:06:56,00:07:00,"So this guy invented the ice rink, his brother was Samwise Gange."
00:07:00,00:07:01,- That's amazing.
00:07:01,00:07:03,"- He was Lord of the Rings, and the other guy was Lord of the Rings."
00:07:03,00:07:07,"- There's not quite true to the text, is it?"
00:07:07,00:07:09,"- He's Lord of the Rings, but we'll allow it."
00:07:09,00:07:14,"- So, Samp Gange is named after a cloth."
00:07:14,00:07:16,- Yeah. - And his wife were both named after surgical instruments.
00:07:16,00:07:20,"- That's so funny. Surely that's a bit of a hack move, isn't it?"
00:07:20,00:07:21,- It's like the least Lord of the Rings thing to do.
00:07:21,00:07:24,"You think of being able to do some God or something, yeah."
00:07:24,00:07:25,- It's like being called Trevor Gors.
00:07:25,00:07:29,"- So, never butterfly stitch."
00:07:29,00:07:35,- What if all the characters in Lord of the Rings are named after all this stuff?
00:07:35,00:07:36,- Maybe they are.
00:07:36,00:07:37,- Maybe they are.
00:07:37,00:07:44,"- So, we should talk about the machines that go up and down ice rinks, fixing the ice."
00:07:44,00:07:45,- That's what the public are crying at.
00:07:45,00:07:49,"- You mean, Zambezi's?"
00:07:49,00:07:50,- Zambezi's?
00:07:50,00:07:51,- Zambonis.
00:07:51,00:07:52,- Zambezi's?
00:07:52,00:07:53,- Zambezi is a river in Africa.
00:07:54,00:07:55,Very rarely freezes.
00:07:55,00:07:59,- I assume they were named after that.
00:07:59,00:08:00,"- Yeah. Sorry, you mean Zambonis."
00:08:00,00:08:01,"- Yeah, I do."
00:08:01,00:08:03,"- Yeah, of course they're huge here."
00:08:03,00:08:06,- That's very optimistic that I'm going to edit that.
00:08:06,00:08:12,"- Yeah, I didn't realise the previous procedure, which was so laborious."
00:08:12,00:08:16,"You had a tractor on the ice, and that would pull along a scraper."
00:08:16,00:08:19,"Because obviously, as people skate, there are all these little shavings that get"
00:08:19,00:08:20,sort of cut out of the ice.
00:08:20,00:08:22,"So, you have a tractor pulling along a scraper."
00:08:22,00:08:25,"The scraper scrapes it all up, and then you have to have someone walking behind"
00:08:25,00:08:30,"spraying the ice with water, and then squeegeeing it up to mop it up."
00:08:30,00:08:33,"So, you don't have too much water on the ice, I don't know."
00:08:33,00:08:35,- I think it's basically shaving the top layer off the ice.
00:08:35,00:08:38,"So, you've got the smoothness, and then putting a new layer on that's just smooth."
00:08:38,00:08:40,"It's basically like repainting, but with water."
00:08:40,00:08:41,- Yeah.
00:08:41,00:08:43,"- But then, does the person walking behind leave a lot of footprint in the ice at then?"
00:08:43,00:08:46,Another machine has to come behind to sweep up.
00:08:46,00:08:48,"- It's another person, actually, with slightly smaller feet."
00:08:52,00:08:53,"- Yeah, they're great."
00:08:53,00:08:55,"So, these are apparently a big deal in the world of ice hockey,"
00:08:55,00:08:59,"which I'm not very afraid with, and in America, but they're invented by"
00:08:59,00:09:02,this guy called Frank Zamboni in 1949.
00:09:02,00:09:05,"And they were first made out of Old World War II parts, weren't they?"
00:09:05,00:09:07,"So, the first one was made out of bits of a..."
00:09:07,00:09:08,- Spitfire.
00:09:08,00:09:10,"- Is it a tank, wasn't it?"
00:09:10,00:09:12,"- It was a Douglas bomber, so it was an aeroplane."
00:09:12,00:09:13,"But I think other bits were made out of tanks, maybe."
00:09:13,00:09:15,"- I think the whole thing was that when he made the machinery,"
00:09:15,00:09:18,"he'd then put it on like a military buggy and drove it around,"
00:09:18,00:09:19,"and that was like, it was like a..."
00:09:19,00:09:20,"- Ah, really?"
00:09:20,00:09:21,- That's so funny.
00:09:21,00:09:24,"- I went on the website, and the official website, Zamboni."
00:09:24,00:09:26,"And on the biography, it says,"
00:09:26,00:09:28,"""If necessity is a modern invention,"
00:09:28,00:09:31,"Frank Zamboni is probably the father, which I think is a bit of a semi..."""
00:09:31,00:09:35,"You say, ""One successful, quite specific invention."""
00:09:35,00:09:37,"- No, have you seen the other things he invented?"
00:09:37,00:09:38,- Go on.
00:09:38,00:09:40,- One of them's called a black widow.
00:09:40,00:09:43,It's a machine that's invented to fill in the dirt on top of symmetry vault.
00:09:43,00:09:48,"- Effectively, leveling the soil on top of a vault"
00:09:48,00:09:50,is very similar to leveling the ice on a...
00:09:50,00:09:51,"- Yeah, it's a simple one-trick pony."
00:09:51,00:09:53,- He's not a one-trick pony.
00:09:53,00:09:54,- He's a dad-trick.
00:09:54,00:09:55,- A dad-trick.
00:09:55,00:09:58,"- Because he's also invented the Astro Zamboni,"
00:09:58,00:10:00,which removes rainwater from Astro turf.
00:10:00,00:10:03,"And when they had the 50th birthday of the Zamboni proper,"
00:10:03,00:10:07,"Zamboni classic, they had a Zamboni driver of the year competition."
00:10:07,00:10:08,- Yeah.
00:10:08,00:10:11,"- Which was one by a guy called Jim McNeill,"
00:10:11,00:10:14,who said it was a thrill right up there with getting married and having children.
00:10:14,00:10:19,Did you see what he did next?
00:10:19,00:10:20,"- Obviously, you got divorced."
00:10:20,00:10:21,- Get divorced.
00:10:21,00:10:24,- Abandoned his children.
00:10:24,00:10:27,"- Actually, it was a bigger thrill."
00:10:27,00:10:30,- Just packing all this stuff up and driving around a Zamboni.
00:10:30,00:10:34,"- In 2006, two skating rink workers were fired"
00:10:34,00:10:37,after driving a Zamboni to a Burger King drive-through.
00:10:37,00:10:42,"They got fired immediately, and the director of parks said,"
00:10:42,00:10:45,"""When we interview them, they didn't seem to be too concerned about it."""
00:10:47,00:10:49,"""Did they leave the Burger King floor extremely smooth?"""
00:10:49,00:10:50,- I don't know.
00:10:50,00:10:50,- I don't know.
00:10:50,00:10:52,"- I wish we moved on, guys."
00:10:52,00:10:53,- Yeah.
00:10:53,00:10:56,"- Oh, can I tell you a really cool thing you can do with ice super quickly?"
00:10:56,00:10:59,"If you get a bit of cheese wire and you hang weights on either side of it,"
00:10:59,00:11:01,"and you get a big block of ice,"
00:11:01,00:11:03,"so like make a big block of ice, bit of cheese wire,"
00:11:03,00:11:06,"hang two liter bottles of water on either side of the cheese wire,"
00:11:06,00:11:07,and you put it over the ice.
00:11:07,00:11:09,"So it gradually cuts through it, yeah?"
00:11:09,00:11:14,And the ice re-freezes behind the cheese wire as it cuts through it.
00:11:14,00:11:18,"So the cheese wire will cut all the way through the ice, come out the other end,"
00:11:18,00:11:20,and you've got a completely intact block of ice.
00:11:20,00:11:21,- That's amazing.
00:11:21,00:11:25,So you spend all that time and all of your objects are exactly the same as they were when you started.
00:11:25,00:11:27,- Hopefully it's almost a food dialect.
00:11:27,00:11:40,"- Okay, it's time for fact number two, and that is Anna."
00:11:40,00:11:42,"- Yeah, my fact this week is that in 1912,"
00:11:42,00:11:45,the Toronto government ran a fly swatting competition.
00:11:45,00:11:49,It was one by a 15-year-old girl who killed half a million flies.
00:11:49,00:11:53,"- So, so weird, it's..."
00:11:53,00:11:55,"I think I read about this on a site called Knowledge Nuts,"
00:11:55,00:11:57,which I think it's covered in it.
00:11:57,00:11:58,"It's a really great site, guys."
00:11:58,00:12:01,"I felt like I had to mention it, because it's not in many other places."
00:12:01,00:12:04,So this is this contest that flies were a massive problem in 1912.
00:12:04,00:12:06,"They spread lots of disease, there was manure everywhere,"
00:12:06,00:12:09,there were big piles of rubbish everywhere in the streets.
00:12:09,00:12:09,- So that wasn't the flies.
00:12:09,00:12:12,"- I was going to say, the flies aren't causing the manure."
00:12:12,00:12:16,- They're going to cause very small amounts of manure.
00:12:16,00:12:18,"- Yeah, so they're writing to the problem, I would say."
00:12:18,00:12:20,"- Well, actually they aren't they doing the eat manure,"
00:12:20,00:12:22,and then they produce a different type of manure.
00:12:22,00:12:24,"- What's interesting about that is they take manure,"
00:12:24,00:12:26,and then they replace it with manure.
00:12:26,00:12:27,It's very much like Anna's ice.
00:12:27,00:12:31,- They redistribute manure.
00:12:31,00:12:33,They're redistributing manure on people.
00:12:33,00:12:37,"The government didn't like it, and so the Chief Medical Officer"
00:12:37,00:12:40,"in the Toronto government got together with the Daily Star,"
00:12:40,00:12:42,launched this contest.
00:12:42,00:12:45,"Every contestant had to be under 16, and they said they give away cash prizes"
00:12:45,00:12:48,to the children who brought in the most fly corpses.
00:12:48,00:12:51,"And there were people who came, and they came to the,"
00:12:51,00:12:54,"this guy called Dr. Hastings, who was the Chief Medical Officer,"
00:12:54,00:12:57,"and they brought their fly corpses to him every day,"
00:12:57,00:12:58,and he counted them up.
00:12:58,00:12:59,"And there were lots of quite strict rules,"
00:12:59,00:13:02,so you couldn't try and pad out your pint with other material.
00:13:02,00:13:03,That was against the rules.
00:13:03,00:13:06,"You couldn't breed the flies once you got them in order to make more,"
00:13:06,00:13:09,because that kind of defeats that whole object.
00:13:09,00:13:10,"How do they know you're not going to do that, though?"
00:13:10,00:13:11,- Exactly.
00:13:11,00:13:12,- They just asked you not to.
00:13:12,00:13:13,It was on trust.
00:13:13,00:13:15,"- That's like, what city was it in China,"
00:13:15,00:13:19,"that started offering a bounty for every mouse,"
00:13:19,00:13:21,or rat tail or something?
00:13:21,00:13:22,"- Yeah, I know people just made rat farms,"
00:13:22,00:13:25,"and then just like, but brain mass bred these rats."
00:13:25,00:13:26,- It's quite crafty.
00:13:26,00:13:28,"- The idea of padding it out with other stuff, though."
00:13:28,00:13:30,"Because that's in a Greek myth, isn't it?"
00:13:30,00:13:32,"Someone, you know, the someone is going to pay the gods some tribute,"
00:13:32,00:13:34,"and he puts in the sack of rubbish awful,"
00:13:34,00:13:35,"but then he puts a nice steak on top of it,"
00:13:35,00:13:37,"and the gods think, oh, it's sack of steak,"
00:13:37,00:13:39,"and then they work it out, because they're not complete idiots."
00:13:39,00:13:42,"- There was an old scam that they used to do with vegetable oil,"
00:13:42,00:13:46,in that they'd sell you a massive tank of vegetable oil.
00:13:46,00:13:49,"But actually, it would be water with oil on top of it,"
00:13:49,00:13:52,"because of course, oil flow, and you don't see the oil part."
00:13:52,00:13:55,- And that is why cooking oil now always comes in transparent bottles.
00:13:55,00:13:57,You've got to see it all the way down.
00:13:57,00:14:01,So we've established that piling rubbish underneath
00:14:01,00:14:03,"and putting the valuable thing on top is a common trope,"
00:14:03,00:14:07,"and the Toronto government anticipated this, and said please don't do it kids."
00:14:07,00:14:09,- Why was the competition only for 16 and younger?
00:14:09,00:14:10,"If this is a genuine problem, they were trying to solve."
00:14:10,00:14:12,"Why would they then suddenly, we only want youth involved?"
00:14:12,00:14:13,"- People have got jobs, Alex."
00:14:13,00:14:16,"- Well, kids, have school."
00:14:16,00:14:18,"I bet this girl, Beatrice White,"
00:14:18,00:14:20,skived a lot of school to get this good.
00:14:20,00:14:21,"So this is the girl who won it,"
00:14:21,00:14:23,"and she set these proper traps,"
00:14:23,00:14:25,"and if you look up, if you go to old newspaper archives,"
00:14:25,00:14:26,you can see pictures.
00:14:26,00:14:29,"They're quite elaborate, so she put raw liver underneath them,"
00:14:29,00:14:31,"and she designed a one-way funnel,"
00:14:31,00:14:34,"and then she'd agitate fly, so they flew towards the raw liver,"
00:14:34,00:14:35,"it went through the one-way funnel,"
00:14:35,00:14:37,"and then they'd get stuck in these contraptions,"
00:14:37,00:14:38,"she'd built out of wood and wire,"
00:14:38,00:14:40,"and then she'd collect them at the end of every day,"
00:14:40,00:14:44,"and she'd delivered 500,000 flies to the government."
00:14:44,00:14:45,- It's amazing.
00:14:45,00:14:47,"- She killed them with poisonous, well, didn't she?"
00:14:47,00:14:48,- Yeah.
00:14:48,00:14:49,- I wonder what poison kills flies.
00:14:49,00:14:51,"- Ooh, I know one."
00:14:51,00:14:52,- What? - Arsenic.
00:14:52,00:14:53,- How does that?
00:14:53,00:14:56,- Because fly paper used to be full of arsenic.
00:14:56,00:14:59,"And people would soak fly paper in water,"
00:14:59,00:15:02,"let the poison leak out, and then you'd have poisonous water,"
00:15:02,00:15:05,"and people would, people murdered each other in the 19th century,"
00:15:05,00:15:07,with fly paper water.
00:15:07,00:15:09,"- Today? - Yeah, you'd say, have a nice glass of water."
00:15:09,00:15:11,"- There's one called Florence Maybrook in 1889,"
00:15:11,00:15:13,who poisoned a husband who was convicted
00:15:13,00:15:15,of arsenic poisoning a husband using fly paper.
00:15:15,00:15:16,- Really?
00:15:16,00:15:20,"- Oh, yeah, but didn't she claim that he liked to self-medicate"
00:15:20,00:15:22,with arsenic for his libido?
00:15:22,00:15:23,"And there wasn't enough evidence either way,"
00:15:23,00:15:26,"so she escaped being executed for it,"
00:15:26,00:15:27,but she did stay in prison for a long time.
00:15:27,00:15:30,"- That's a whole crime work, that's a whole thing."
00:15:30,00:15:32,"We think you did it, we're not totally sure,"
00:15:32,00:15:34,"so we're sort of going to go for a piece of a sentence,"
00:15:34,00:15:35,but not a full one.
00:15:35,00:15:39,- What they should have done is stuck her odds of fly paper for 20 years.
00:15:39,00:15:44,"- If she was a Greek parable, that would have been what they had done."
00:15:44,00:15:46,- My husband and life actually liked shooting himself.
00:15:46,00:15:48,Was it for his libido?
00:15:48,00:15:53,"- Well, they did used to use arsenic in some medicines, I think,"
00:15:53,00:15:54,didn't they? Tiny amounts.
00:15:54,00:15:56,"So maybe, yeah, it's plausible, I believe her."
00:15:57,00:16:01,"So for many years, in many places, collecting flies"
00:16:01,00:16:03,and giving them to the government has gotten you money.
00:16:03,00:16:14,"So in China, officials in Luai Yang offered $125 per 2000 dead flies during a campaign."
00:16:14,00:16:17,Each fly was worth about seven cents.
00:16:17,00:16:19,- Was that a massive amount for a fly?
00:16:19,00:16:20,"- Yeah, it is, it's a recent, sorry."
00:16:20,00:16:21,"- That was quite recently, yeah."
00:16:21,00:16:25,"In Pennsylvania, in Mansfield, Pennsylvania, in 1914,"
00:16:25,00:16:28,it was five cents per pint of flies.
00:16:28,00:16:35,"You would get, in 1988 in Manila, it was $4.75 per 1000 flies."
00:16:35,00:16:38,So all the prices are very different.
00:16:38,00:16:38,- Yeah.
00:16:38,00:16:40,- And there was a guy called Mr. Bellen.
00:16:40,00:16:46,- About whom James has nothing interesting to say.
00:16:46,00:16:47,He just doesn't really want me to get that name in.
00:16:47,00:16:53,- It would be great because he was collecting flies.
00:16:53,00:16:57,It would be great if his name became a verb to collect flies.
00:16:57,00:16:59,"I Bellen, he Bellen, he Bellen."
00:16:59,00:17:05,"No, he was delivering an average of 200,000 dead flies per week,"
00:17:05,00:17:07,"making about $1,000 a week."
00:17:07,00:17:08,- Wow.
00:17:08,00:17:09,- How was he doing that?
00:17:09,00:17:12,"- Well, he wouldn't give away his tricks."
00:17:12,00:17:13,And what tools was he using?
00:17:13,00:17:17,"Well, people suggested that he was hatching maggots himself."
00:17:17,00:17:19,"An allegation he denied, vehemently."
00:17:19,00:17:21,"- Well, you would do, wouldn't you, with $1,000 a week?"
00:17:22,00:17:25,- He said that catching flies are a lot like hunting or fishing.
00:17:25,00:17:27,"You, first of all, you have to find out where they hang out,"
00:17:27,00:17:28,and then you go there.
00:17:28,00:17:33,And he used a giant fly swatter which he invented himself.
00:17:33,00:17:36,"- When he say invented, was it just a fly spot, but much bigger?"
00:17:36,00:17:39,- He wouldn't give anything more away in the article that I read.
00:17:39,00:17:42,"- Just, you said that to catch them, you have to go to where they are."
00:17:42,00:17:42,- Yeah.
00:17:42,00:17:48,"- So, the second place in this competition in Toronto in 1912"
00:17:48,00:17:52,went to a girl who lived quite near a 90-meter-long heap of manure.
00:17:52,00:17:55,- She knows.
00:17:55,00:17:58,- She never thought that would be an asset for the parents of buying the house.
00:17:58,00:18:00,- And so much with the fly catcher competition.
00:18:00,00:18:03,I can actually afford a slightly larger heap of manure now.
00:18:03,00:18:07,But they ran the competition the next year.
00:18:07,00:18:11,"They ran it for a second time, and there weren't any flies to catch."
00:18:11,00:18:13,Because Beatrice White had scooped them all up.
00:18:13,00:18:16,But her sister came second following year.
00:18:16,00:18:19,"- And she still, her sister still caught 200,000 or something?"
00:18:19,00:18:21,"- No, she got 50,000, nothing."
00:18:21,00:18:23,There's still a lot of flies.
00:18:23,00:18:26,"- Newspaper, the Toronto, I think it's the Toronto star."
00:18:26,00:18:27,- Yeah.
00:18:27,00:18:30,"- The Toronto star in Toronto, they tracked down Beatrice White,"
00:18:30,00:18:31,"who would have been about 71, I think."
00:18:31,00:18:35,"And they ran a headline, ""The Queen of Fly Killers Found Alive."""
00:18:35,00:18:38,And they gave her a count of insecticide to thank her.
00:18:38,00:18:39,- Yeah.
00:18:39,00:18:42,"And she said that the 50 dollars that she'd won,"
00:18:42,00:18:44,"she desperately wanted it to pay for her music lessons,"
00:18:44,00:18:46,and her dad had kept it for himself.
00:18:46,00:18:47,- Really?
00:18:47,00:18:49,"- Yeah, tough times."
00:18:49,00:18:50,- That is bad.
00:18:50,00:18:54,"- I think each housefly can carry 6.6 billion,"
00:18:54,00:18:56,"sorry, obviously not billion."
00:18:56,00:19:00,Each housefly can carry 6.6 million bacteria on it.
00:19:00,00:19:01,Many of which are bad.
00:19:01,00:19:02,I know some are good.
00:19:02,00:19:04,We all end up with a yackled advert.
00:19:04,00:19:05,But some of them are bad.
00:19:05,00:19:06,- You wouldn't have passed down a pint of flies
00:19:06,00:19:09,in the vague hope that some of the bacteria might be friendly.
00:19:09,00:19:13,"I gotta say, though, the difference between a million and a billion,"
00:19:13,00:19:16,"it's like, it's hardly as if, ""Oh, thank God it's only a million."""
00:19:16,00:19:21,"- I wasn't thinking, ""Don't be ridiculous, Alan."""
00:19:21,00:19:22,They couldn't have a billion.
00:19:22,00:19:23,They must have a million.
00:19:23,00:19:26,- It seemed silly to me.
00:19:26,00:19:39,"Okay, it's time for fact number three."
00:19:39,00:19:41,And that is Alex.
00:19:41,00:19:46,"My fact this week is that when animating 101 Dalmatians,"
00:19:46,00:19:48,Disney photocopied the dogs.
00:19:48,00:19:50,- Is that why they're black and white?
00:19:50,00:19:54,- Was that of the office party after the shooter then did?
00:19:54,00:19:56,- We photocopied our bums.
00:19:56,00:19:56,What else can we do?
00:19:56,00:20:01,- Do you know who first came up with the idea of photographing your body parts?
00:20:01,00:20:01,- No.
00:20:01,00:20:03,- A genius of some sort.
00:20:03,00:20:05,"- Yes, Einstein."
00:20:05,00:20:06,"- No, Andy Warhol."
00:20:06,00:20:07,- Really?
00:20:08,00:20:11,"- Apparently, it seems like he was possibly the first person to do it."
00:20:11,00:20:15,"In 1969, he walked into an art supply store and he knew the owner,"
00:20:15,00:20:17,who's called Donald Havanek.
00:20:17,00:20:21,And he convinced him to let him do some photocopying of himself.
00:20:21,00:20:24,And there are images of him with his face on a photocopier.
00:20:24,00:20:26,He didn't do his bum as far as I know.
00:20:26,00:20:28,"- I would wish that the first person to do that,"
00:20:28,00:20:31,knowing that human condition would have been the person who invented the photocopier
00:20:31,00:20:32,moments after inventing it.
00:20:32,00:20:34,Because that's going to be the first thing you ever do in the photocopier.
00:20:34,00:20:35,- I don't know.
00:20:35,00:20:39,"What I would be impressed by, because everyone now has photocopied parts of"
00:20:39,00:20:41,themselves using the flatbed on a photocopier.
00:20:41,00:20:44,I want to see the person who photocopied himself using the document feeder.
00:20:44,00:20:50,"- That'd be amazing, yeah."
00:20:50,00:20:50,- Yeah.
00:20:50,00:20:51,- Sliding yourself through.
00:20:51,00:20:53,- What do you mean they photocopied the dog?
00:20:53,00:20:55,- So this was in the late 50s.
00:20:55,00:20:59,Disney had made Sleeping Beauty and the way that they made that was that every
00:20:59,00:21:02,single frame of the film has to be really painstakingly drawn
00:21:02,00:21:06,and then transferred onto painted onto glass cells.
00:21:06,00:21:08,And this is a really expensive and time consuming process.
00:21:08,00:21:09,And then it didn't do very well at the box office.
00:21:09,00:21:12,So Disney was thinking of shutting down their animation offices.
00:21:12,00:21:15,So they had to come up with cheaper ways of making these films.
00:21:15,00:21:21,And so one of the creatives at Disney got some equipment from Xerox
00:21:21,00:21:26,and modified it and found a way of basically photocopying certain elements of the drawings
00:21:26,00:21:28,and putting them onto the glass cells.
00:21:28,00:21:33,So they then next made 101 Dalmatians and realised that they could specifically photocopy
00:21:33,00:21:35,the spots on the dogs because they're going to stay the same.
00:21:35,00:21:39,And you need the same different combination of spots on each dog.
00:21:39,00:21:41,And it needs to be the same dog and stay the same.
00:21:41,00:21:43,And then the background thing to say the same.
00:21:43,00:21:47,And they came up with this way of identifying the dogs by thinking of the spots as constellations.
00:21:47,00:21:50,And it costed about half as much the film as it would have done.
00:21:50,00:21:54,And kind of say Disney and then transformed the way that they would animate films
00:21:54,00:21:56,from then on until the computer year.
00:21:56,00:22:01,Does that mean all the spots on the dogs are constellations?
00:22:01,00:22:03,"No, they're just, they were thought of like constellations."
00:22:03,00:22:05,"Okay, I don't remember them."
00:22:05,00:22:08,It does mean that it would have been like three Dalmatians if they didn't have Xerox intelligent.
00:22:08,00:22:12,"She just made a tiny, tiny little glove out of it."
00:22:12,00:22:18,Maybe the Xerox machine only did 100 copies as maximum.
00:22:18,00:22:24,Do you know what toner is made of in photocopiers?
00:22:24,00:22:25,Is it pig fat?
00:22:25,00:22:26,It's pig fat.
00:22:26,00:22:27,Is it great?
00:22:27,00:22:28,"No, of course not."
00:22:28,00:22:30,"It's different from ink, isn't it?"
00:22:30,00:22:31,There's a difference between toner and ink.
00:22:31,00:22:32,"It's not ink, yeah."
00:22:32,00:22:35,It's like electrostatically charged particles.
00:22:35,00:22:36,"Oh, you do know what it is."
00:22:36,00:22:38,"Yeah, well, it's, it is."
00:22:38,00:22:42,"But it's, there's incredibly fine powder."
00:22:42,00:22:43,"Yeah, some of it, a lot of it's rust."
00:22:43,00:22:44,Rust.
00:22:44,00:22:45,"Iron oxide, yeah."
00:22:45,00:22:46,"And they're plastic as well, right?"
00:22:46,00:22:48,And there's lots of plastic.
00:22:48,00:22:51,Modern color photocopy toner is 95% plastic.
00:22:51,00:22:54,"Milled into a tiny, tiny, tiny powder,"
00:22:54,00:22:56,which then gets fused by heat with the paper.
00:22:56,00:22:57,Okay.
00:22:57,00:22:58,I had no idea.
00:22:58,00:23:00,The photocopy toner is not ink.
00:23:00,00:23:01,That's why it's so expensive.
00:23:01,00:23:02,Yeah.
00:23:02,00:23:05,Because you always see that it's like 10 times more expensive
00:23:05,00:23:07,"than champagne or something, don't you?"
00:23:07,00:23:07,Yeah.
00:23:07,00:23:09,"And it is done by electromagnetism, isn't it?"
00:23:09,00:23:11,So I think it's a really complicated process.
00:23:11,00:23:14,But you make the bits that you want to have toner on
00:23:14,00:23:15,be kind of magnetic.
00:23:15,00:23:17,And then it attracts the toner to it.
00:23:17,00:23:18,So it needs to be charged.
00:23:18,00:23:21,So the toner has the opposite charge to the bits of the paper.
00:23:21,00:23:22,"That's amazing, isn't it?"
00:23:22,00:23:22,Do you know this?
00:23:22,00:23:23,I didn't know this.
00:23:23,00:23:26,Do you know that Canon has been warning people
00:23:26,00:23:29,to take better care of their office equipment?
00:23:29,00:23:30,It's how they put it.
00:23:30,00:23:31,This is what I'm seeing it.
00:23:31,00:23:34,"But especially during the festive season,"
00:23:34,00:23:38,it says the Christmas season leaves to 25% hike in service calls
00:23:38,00:23:40,due to incidents such as backside copying pranks.
00:23:40,00:23:45,So there is actually a big increase in photocopier accidents
00:23:45,00:23:46,during the festive seasons.
00:23:46,00:23:48,"They've asked us to stop doing it, please."
00:23:48,00:23:49,"Well, I won't."
00:23:50,00:23:52,I don't know what those squares at Canon have to say.
00:23:52,00:23:55,And he just replies to the last with 20 copies of his own.
00:23:55,00:24:00,"Do you know, using a lot of people use Xerox, especially in America,"
00:24:00,00:24:03,as a generic word for a photocopier?
00:24:03,00:24:04,Yes.
00:24:04,00:24:09,"And according to an advert from 2003, Xerox said,"
00:24:09,00:24:12,"when you use Xerox, the way you use aspirin, we get a headache."
00:24:12,00:24:15,And that they really hate the way people do this.
00:24:15,00:24:18,And the reason being is something called generic side.
00:24:18,00:24:22,"And what it is, is it's when you have your brand becoming"
00:24:22,00:24:24,so ubiquitous that everyone uses it.
00:24:24,00:24:28,It means that you can't really claim intellectual property over that word.
00:24:28,00:24:31,And so it means your trademark is basically dead and buried.
00:24:31,00:24:31,Yeah.
00:24:31,00:24:32,And that's why Google don't like you say.
00:24:32,00:24:33,I'm going to Google it.
00:24:33,00:24:37,"They want you to say, I'm going to search it online using google.com"
00:24:37,00:24:37,or Velcro.
00:24:37,00:24:38,They don't like to be called Velcro.
00:24:38,00:24:40,"Obviously, there are advantages to that"
00:24:40,00:24:42,because you become a very famous brand.
00:24:42,00:24:45,"But then at the same time, it's very difficult to protect your trademark."
00:24:45,00:24:47,"I mean, it hasn't worked for Google, for instance."
00:24:47,00:24:48,Where are they now?
00:24:48,00:24:49,Yeah.
00:24:49,00:24:51,Crushed under the Ask Jeaves juggernaut.
00:24:51,00:24:56,There was a bug in 2013 in Xerox machines which meant that
00:24:56,00:24:59,sometimes numbers would be randomly replaced and photocopied.
00:24:59,00:25:01,People would be photocopy really important documents.
00:25:01,00:25:03,And then I think falls would change the ones.
00:25:03,00:25:05,And then this guy--
00:25:05,00:25:07,That explains 404 Dalmatians.
00:25:07,00:25:12,The guy did like a TED talk on it and kind of revealed this bug.
00:25:12,00:25:14,And then Xerox took him on board and fixed the bug.
00:25:14,00:25:15,Wow.
00:25:15,00:25:16,Yeah.
00:25:16,00:25:16,That's good.
00:25:16,00:25:17,That's amazing.
00:25:17,00:25:17,Okay.
00:25:17,00:25:24,So the guy who invented the photocopier or the Xerox is so nice.
00:25:24,00:25:26,It's a really happy story.
00:25:26,00:25:29,It's just from a start to finish.
00:25:29,00:25:31,This guy's called Chester Carlson.
00:25:31,00:25:34,And he was brought up really poor.
00:25:34,00:25:37,So he used to have to sleep in a chicken coop sometimes.
00:25:37,00:25:39,He spent some time having to sleep outside.
00:25:39,00:25:40,Where did the chicken sleep?
00:25:40,00:25:43,They slept in his full poster bed upstairs.
00:25:46,00:25:49,"But he came up with this amazing technology,"
00:25:49,00:25:50,which was really complicated.
00:25:50,00:25:52,"And when people talk about it,"
00:25:52,00:25:54,combined loads of different techniques
00:25:54,00:25:55,that no one had ever thought of combining before.
00:25:55,00:25:58,And was rejected by more than 20 companies.
00:25:58,00:26:00,And it's since been called like the most important thing
00:26:00,00:26:02,to happen in printing since the printing press.
00:26:02,00:26:05,Because his technology also was what laser printers do.
00:26:05,00:26:08,So he basically came up with modern printing and photocopying.
00:26:08,00:26:10,But he eventually--
00:26:10,00:26:11,"you know when you expect to get to the end of these stories,"
00:26:11,00:26:14,"it'd be like, oh, he sold the rights to someone and got a tenor."
00:26:14,00:26:16,He then went into perpetual motion.
00:26:16,00:26:20,Didn't stop spinning for the rest of his life.
00:26:20,00:26:25,He got a 16th of a cent for every single Xerox copy made
00:26:25,00:26:27,throughout 1965.
00:26:27,00:26:28,Which was a lot.
00:26:28,00:26:30,That's why it's so expensive.
00:26:30,00:26:32,"No, as long as that is about 10 years, the period."
00:26:32,00:26:35,"Through 21965, yes, from when he made it."
00:26:35,00:26:36,But he lived really humbly.
00:26:36,00:26:39,And he never bought much staff.
00:26:39,00:26:40,He gave all of his money away.
00:26:40,00:26:42,He would never ever wanted his name to be on staff.
00:26:42,00:26:44,"So when he gave his money to universities and stuff,"
00:26:44,00:26:48,he asked them to put it in honor of the teacher who'd inspired him and things like that.
00:26:48,00:26:50,Is it possible that that was just cover story
00:26:50,00:26:52,and that what he did was he invented a photocopie
00:26:52,00:26:53,and then just photocopied money?
00:26:53,00:26:55,No one really caught up with him for years.
00:26:55,00:26:56,"Well, it effectively is."
00:26:56,00:26:57,"It's printing, isn't it?"
00:26:57,00:26:58,"Basically printing money, yeah."
00:26:58,00:27:02,A 16th of a cent for every Xerox copy made is unbelievable.
00:27:02,00:27:03,"Yeah, that's the same."
00:27:03,00:27:05,"Yeah, but I know you're right."
00:27:05,00:27:06,He gave it all away.
00:27:06,00:27:08,But he had a business partner at the start.
00:27:08,00:27:13,"He was a guy called Otto Kornai, I think he might have been an Austrian, I'm not sure."
00:27:13,00:27:16,But he walked away about a year into the process.
00:27:16,00:27:17,"He said, I don't see this going anywhere."
00:27:17,00:27:18,I do.
00:27:18,00:27:20,And he could have been a multi-millionaire.
00:27:20,00:27:21,"But, yeah."
00:27:21,00:27:22,I know.
00:27:22,00:27:26,"But Chester Carlson, the reason he tried to invent a photocopie in the first place"
00:27:26,00:27:29,was because he worked for years as a law student and a patent attorney.
00:27:29,00:27:33,And he spent like all his time copying legal documents by hand
00:27:33,00:27:35,and developed chronic arthritis because of it.
00:27:35,00:27:36,And he was just so pissed off that he had to do this.
00:27:36,00:27:39,"That he was like, I need him sheen for this."
00:27:39,00:27:40,Hi.
00:27:40,00:27:42,"He did other, he had other inventions."
00:27:42,00:27:44,"Uh, there we go."
00:27:44,00:27:45,"I'm not sure, I'm not sure."
00:27:45,00:27:47,I'm not sure.
00:27:47,00:27:50,A raincoat with gottas to channel water away from crowds away.
00:27:50,00:27:54,"Now, actually, that is a good idea."
00:27:54,00:27:57,He invented a toothbrush with replaceable bristles.
00:27:57,00:28:01,"He invented a transparent toothpaste tube, which seems really unnecessary."
00:28:01,00:28:05,"No, I would love that because how does they get the stripes in it?"
00:28:05,00:28:09,It's transparent. It means that people can't hide awful inside your toothpaste.
00:28:09,00:28:14,The top millimeter is toothpaste and the rest is just big fat.
00:28:14,00:28:16,The number of times the aquafresh have got me with that trick.
00:28:16,00:28:21,Do you know where photocopying has been banned?
00:28:21,00:28:27,"Oh, um, in the, um, in the Bank of England."
00:28:27,00:28:28,"Oh, that's a good idea."
00:28:28,00:28:29,North Korea.
00:28:29,00:28:31,"Um, it's, well, it may well have been."
00:28:31,00:28:33,I don't know how many photocopies there are in North Korea.
00:28:33,00:28:37,"But in 2010, in Tibet, it was banned."
00:28:37,00:28:43,People in the capital would have to register their name if they wanted to make photocopies.
00:28:43,00:28:49,"Basically, the Chinese authorities were worried about people spreading literature saying,"
00:28:49,00:28:52,"""Hey, maybe the Chinese should leave Tibet."""
00:28:52,00:28:54,"And so they said, ""Well, no more photocopying for you."""
00:28:54,00:28:58,"Fuji has developed a new robotic printer that moves around,"
00:28:58,00:29:02,"allowing your office, bringing documents to the person who printed them."
00:29:02,00:29:03,That's a great idea.
00:29:03,00:29:04,That's awesome.
00:29:04,00:29:04,Yeah.
00:29:04,00:29:05,"I mean, our office is quite small."
00:29:05,00:29:07,I'm not sure how much we get.
00:29:07,00:29:08,And it's got a step in the middle of it.
00:29:08,00:29:09,Yeah.
00:29:09,00:29:15,So if you're in a public space and you have some documents which are quite secure or sensitive
00:29:15,00:29:17,"and you want to print them out, you don't want anyone else to see them."
00:29:17,00:29:20,You don't want to print them and then have to go over because there might be someone
00:29:20,00:29:23,"who stood there and they might read your, your anti-Chinese propaganda."
00:29:23,00:29:28,"And so I'm sorry, I've said sorry about printing that using the office printer, right?"
00:29:28,00:29:31,"And so if they come to you, then it means that you'll always get the right"
00:29:31,00:29:33,once.
00:29:33,00:29:36,"I guess, but isn't there a risk that someone intercepted on the way?"
00:29:36,00:29:36,Yeah.
00:29:36,00:29:40,"You know, if people look at my screen in the concert, they see I'm on free to bet.com."
00:29:40,00:29:45,The sensitive document robot keeps on chopping back and forth to me.
00:29:45,00:29:49,Yeah.
00:29:49,00:29:51,"Actually, photocopying is a holding sensitive document."
00:29:51,00:29:55,"It's a major issue that there's someone, this guy is trying to highlight."
00:29:55,00:29:58,"So I didn't realise this, but every time you photocopy something,"
00:29:58,00:30:02,"then it stores exactly what your photocopy done a hard drive. So since 2002,"
00:30:02,00:30:07,they photocopies have got a record of every single thing that's been through them.
00:30:07,00:30:13,So there's this guy called Jun-Tunen who has a digital security company and he tried to prove how
00:30:13,00:30:18,risky this is by buying randomly buying up some second-hand photocopies. So we bought up four of
00:30:18,00:30:22,them to show that they hold all this digital information. He actually said we didn't even have to
00:30:22,00:30:27,wait for the first one to warm up. One of the copies had documents still on the copy of glass
00:30:27,00:30:31,from the New York Police Department. Oh my god.
00:30:31,00:30:38,What? They didn't even take it out of the thing. They hadn't even take the sex offenders list
00:30:38,00:30:41,of the flatbed in the photocopies. So he opened it up and got that.
00:30:41,00:30:46,"But he hacked into the hard drives and he got, for instance, 300 pages of people's individual"
00:30:46,00:30:51,"medical records. So all details on the medical records. Like blood, blood descriptions, blood test"
00:30:51,00:30:57,"results, diagnoses. He got lots more lists of sex offenders. He got lists of paystubs and people's"
00:30:57,00:31:03,"bank details that they'd photocopied. So yeah, this is a thing. Old photocopies are holding."
00:31:03,00:31:08,"Was one of the photocopies he bought from the New York Police Sex Crimes Department,"
00:31:08,00:31:10,"something like this? It must have been, right? It must have been."
00:31:10,00:31:13,"I think it must have been. He probably was waiting, hovering on the eBay button,"
00:31:13,00:31:28,"breakers and ages. Slam, got it."
00:31:28,00:31:34,"Okay, it's time for a final fact and that is James. Okay, my fact this week is that seeds have brains."
00:31:34,00:31:39,And James doesn't. Are the houses under two aren't brains are they? Are they the same?
00:31:39,00:31:45,"Well, they're smaller. If I was talking to one of the party, how long would it take me to notice"
00:31:45,00:31:52,"that I was talking to a seed? I think that you don't, you tend to make that decision not just based"
00:31:52,00:31:56,"on people's brains. Okay, let's say it's got a face painted on it. He's not talking to people if you"
00:31:56,00:32:02,"notice their brain, what if it's not working? I think that guy over there is an ACON. It's anything."
00:32:02,00:32:08,Case I was being rude. So what this is is they've taken some seeds and they've worked out how
00:32:08,00:32:13,they make the decision of when they need to germinate and they've looked at all the different cells and
00:32:13,00:32:18,"they found that it's just a few cells that make this decision. And it's very complicated, but the way"
00:32:18,00:32:24,they make the decision is quite analogous to the way that animals make decisions with their brains.
00:32:24,00:32:29,"And so the people who have done this study are saying that basically it's very similar to a brain,"
00:32:29,00:32:35,"but much smaller, much simpler, but it's similar. Now that doesn't mean that they have brains like"
00:32:35,00:32:41,"us because they don't, but it's basically quite interesting because the last time plants and animals"
00:32:41,00:32:50,"had a common ancestor was like 1.6 million, sorry, stupid. Even though it was that much time,"
00:32:50,00:32:55,"they've kind of come up with the same solution to the problem, which is by using these cells to"
00:32:55,00:32:59,"communicate with each other and then saying, okay, now that we've communicated, we're going to"
00:32:59,00:33:03,"release these hormones, etc. So it's about the cells communicating with each other within the seeds."
00:33:03,00:33:08,"Exactly. And that's, I mean, what is a brain apart from a few cells communicating with one another?"
00:33:08,00:33:11,"Yeah, it's all minus. It's kind of like you guys."
00:33:11,00:33:15,"But it kind of sounded like it's slightly, well, in the Oscar, it pulled it down a bit to half of"
00:33:15,00:33:19,"the cells are saying, like, grow, grow, grow, grow, grow, and the other ones are saying, like, don't"
00:33:19,00:33:23,"stay, stay here because stay at seed. And it's just up to, like, then it's then deciding which one"
00:33:23,00:33:27,"to follow. Just like when you're in bed and you're like, stay in bed all day or get up and do stuff."
00:33:27,00:33:35,"Yeah. And it's pretty analogous to that because for plant, it can't sprout too early in case the"
00:33:35,00:33:40,"temperature gets cold again, but it can't wait too late. It can't stay in bed too late because then"
00:33:40,00:33:47,all the other seeds will have sprouted and they'll crowd out the results. So it is like that. You
00:33:47,00:33:51,"can't get out of bed too early because it'll be dark and you'll get bump into things, but you can't"
00:33:51,00:33:57,"get out too late, otherwise the tube will be very busy. There was a good headline in New Scientist,"
00:33:57,00:34:05,"which is quite misleading that said, it just said, plant parents tell their seeds when to sprout by"
00:34:05,00:34:11,"passing down their memories. And I thought, this is going to blow this podcast wide, oh, plant up"
00:34:11,00:34:16,memories and they transmit their memories to their children. This is unbelievable.
00:34:16,00:34:20,"It can't transmit memories to each other. Actually, what it is is, but it is still quite interesting."
00:34:20,00:34:25,"So as you say, it's important when seeds sprout and actually sometimes they might want to sprout"
00:34:25,00:34:31,"earlier, depending on the weather and the plant parent can work out. So if it's warm weather,"
00:34:31,00:34:36,it knows that it'll make a slightly thinner casing for its seeds. So it sprouts quickly to
00:34:36,00:34:40,"take advantage of the weather, whereas if it's cold weather, the plant senses that and automatically"
00:34:40,00:34:45,"makes a thick casing for the seed. And that means when it's dispersed, it takes longer to hatch"
00:34:45,00:34:49,"out and the weather will have got warmer by then. So in a way, that is clever. It is very clever."
00:34:49,00:34:55,"But that's like me saying, like, if I put my baby in a hat that I'm passing my memory to it."
00:34:55,00:35:04,"So on plant seeds, you know, organ oil? No. I went to Morocco at the end of last year and they were"
00:35:04,00:35:08,"banging on and on about organ oil in every single market. They're like, you love organ oil, don't you?"
00:35:08,00:35:12,"From organ trees. Yeah, organ, or organ. Organ. So it's a thing that's really"
00:35:12,00:35:16,"popular now, apparently, for girls to use in their hair. It's a, it's a big deal. I can see why you felt"
00:35:16,00:35:24,we would know. Look at Andy's hair. That's riddled with organ. It's ripping with organ. I'm hoping
00:35:24,00:35:30,"it's actually water that I was sold as organ oil when I was a trainer in Morocco. But anyway,"
00:35:30,00:35:34,"this is kind of, this is a massive boon. I'm popular it is for places like Morocco, where"
00:35:34,00:35:39,"it's made. Organ trees were the ones where the goats live. They are. So 60% of organ nuts, which is"
00:35:39,00:35:43,"where you get organ oil, are distributed by goats. So you're right, organ trees are the ones that"
00:35:43,00:35:48,goats climb up and they can get light up to eight metres up a tree. And then they eat the organ
00:35:48,00:35:52,leaves and the fruits and stuff and the seeds. They then regurgitate within about a day and they spit
00:35:52,00:35:57,them out somewhere else. And that's how they're distributed. So this organ oil that you ladies and
00:35:57,00:36:03,"gentlemen are putting on your skinnier hair or whatever it's for, has been dispersed by a tree climbing"
00:36:03,00:36:08,goats. That's very cool. I have a fact about those goats. Go on. It's that the domestic ones don't
00:36:08,00:36:13,"know how to climb trees. And they have to be taught by keepers, human keepers how to climb."
00:36:13,00:36:19,How do they teach them that? I don't know. I haven't found any footage beyond just that fact.
00:36:19,00:36:25,"It's well worth googling organ tree goats, isn't it? Yeah. If you haven't seen that picture before"
00:36:25,00:36:30,it's yeah. Or you can watch the special feature of how to do QI research on volume two of the
00:36:30,00:36:35,"QI DVD box set, which is all about organ trees and goats. Oh, that's how I must have known that."
00:36:35,00:36:42,"That me too, yeah. So elephants transport seeds as well. They can transport seeds up to 65 kilometers"
00:36:42,00:36:47,"away from the tree that they've eaten, the fruit or whatever. And that's by far the biggest"
00:36:47,00:36:53,"mover of seeds out for any animal at all. You know, like three times more than any birds or"
00:36:53,00:36:57,"anything like that, yeah. That's incredible. And it comes out in their feces presumably."
00:36:57,00:37:03,"It does. Okay. So they could, they travel 65 kilometers between poos. That's what it sounds like,"
00:37:03,00:37:11,doesn't it? I've done that on a motorway before. You transported the seeds from self-mins to
00:37:11,00:37:18,carbie services. Where do you think 75% of Mexico's sesame seeds go?
00:37:18,00:37:24,They go into Andy's car to travel up the other six. They get turned into halva paste.
00:37:24,00:37:28,They go to McDonald's. They do. They will end up on McDonald's bird.
00:37:28,00:37:33,"Three quarters of all those sesame seeds in Mexico, I think that's amazing. That is amazing."
00:37:33,00:37:36,"Wow. Wow. Oh, what else do you use them for?"
00:37:36,00:37:42,"It's halva paste. No, what else? Is that another hair product?"
00:37:42,00:37:44,"It's made. No, it's the use of food. It's a mouth product."
00:37:44,00:37:49,"If you put it in your mouth, it's delicious. Is it? Okay, great. I'll look it up."
00:37:49,00:37:53,"So it's food then. It's a food. Okay. Yeah, I call it a mouth product."
00:37:53,00:38:00,I read an article about Mexican farming the other day. It was about the avocado farmers in
00:38:00,00:38:06,various cities. They've now formed their own militias because they were being ripped off
00:38:06,00:38:12,"in blackmailed and extorted by gangsters and they have proper assault weapon militias,"
00:38:12,00:38:16,"concrete bunkers, all this stuff just to protect the avocado crops. It's so valuable to them."
00:38:16,00:38:22,Isn't it avocados though that they would be extinct if it weren't for humans eating them because
00:38:22,00:38:27,they lost the mechanism to distribute their seeds? That is true. It's because avocado seeds are too
00:38:27,00:38:33,large to pass for any animals that are currently extant. So the thing that avocados evolved to be
00:38:33,00:38:38,"distributed by has been extinct for 12,000 years with a very large illness. Yeah, it's evolved to be"
00:38:38,00:38:46,"distributed by Pears Morgan. It was a ground sloth, guys. It was a three-meter-long ground sloth called"
00:38:46,00:38:51,"the Megalonics Jeffersonie and eight avocados and then it was able to distribute the seeds,"
00:38:51,00:38:56,"but they haven't existed for 12,000 years and we don't know why avocados have managed to exist"
00:38:56,00:39:00,without them because humans surely haven't been distributing avocados seeds in a systematic way
00:39:00,00:39:06,"for 12,000 years. It seems unlikely and yet they've stuck around. Can I just say something about"
00:39:06,00:39:12,"brains? So when you sleep, your brain cells shrink to half their normal size. As you sleep,"
00:39:12,00:39:16,"your brain cells literally get half as big as they are. To do a head shrink? Yeah, it's all the size."
00:39:16,00:39:20,"Is your brain literally 50 per size? Yes, it is. Have you never seen a sleeping person? It's like"
00:39:20,00:39:28,"an old-sized body and then a doll's head. No, it's incredible. It's unbelievable. Is that why you"
00:39:28,00:39:35,"yawn when you wake up because you're like re-inflating yourself? No, they found this out recently,"
00:39:35,00:39:39,they can shrink by up to 60 per cent while you sleep and they think this is because I think we've
00:39:39,00:39:45,mentioned that they've recently discovered that the purpose of sleep they believe is to flush out
00:39:45,00:39:48,all the waste from your brain. So it allows fluid to travel around your brain cells and in between
00:39:48,00:39:53,them and kind of flush out all the useless stuff and that's why your brain uses the same amount of energy
00:39:53,00:39:57,"when you sleep as when you're awake because it's doing all this stuff and it's thought that by shrinking,"
00:39:57,00:40:01,it creates more space around the cells so that the fluid can flush through them more easily and get
00:40:01,00:40:08,"rid of all the waste. That is amazing. Isn't it so cool? Yeah, that's amazing. If you get a"
00:40:08,00:40:15,"bowl and you put it in a female bowl, this is and you put it in a cage with a male bowl and then"
00:40:15,00:40:20,you stimulate certain parts of its brain then the female bowl will fall in love with the male bowl.
00:40:20,00:40:27,So which brain are you stimulating? The females. Really? Yep. Why would you do that? Is this some kind of
00:40:27,00:40:36,"Shakespearean comedy where they have a love potion? The taming of the bowl. No, this is just a"
00:40:36,00:40:41,study that was done in Atlanta and they got this bowl and they stimulated it and put it in with the
00:40:41,00:40:47,male and then they put the female bowl in to another cage with both that male and another one and she
00:40:47,00:40:52,always went to the one that she was hanging out with while she was being stimulated in the brain and
00:40:52,00:40:57,then they did it with another bowl who hadn't had her brain stimulated and she would more often go
00:40:57,00:41:02,for the new guy. Oh really? It's got anything to do because the bowl is an anagram for love and if
00:41:02,00:41:09,"you're scrambling someone's brain up they're just like, ""I'm a bowl, I'm in love."" I didn't know we knew"
00:41:09,00:41:13,that bowls felt love. I'm excited. I think we might be extrapolating in the same way that I
00:41:13,00:41:20,extrapolated that this was a brain in a seat. Don't believe anything you've heard over the last time.
00:41:20,00:41:30,"Okay, that's it. That's all of our thanks. Thank you so much for listening. If you want to"
