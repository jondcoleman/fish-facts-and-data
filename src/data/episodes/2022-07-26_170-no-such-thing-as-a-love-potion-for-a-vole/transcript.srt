1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,440
 "Did you know with it, who do I want back at this?"

2
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:07,280
 "Did you know with it, who do I want back at this?"

3
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:08,360
 "Did you know with it?"

4
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:20,240
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly bogguss coming to you from the Kiwai Offices in Covent Garden.

5
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:26,000
 My name is Lightning and I'm sitting here with James Harkin, Anatozhinsky and Alex Bell.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,160
 And once again, we've gathered around the microphones and we've got you our four favourite facts in the last seven days.

7
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:39,880
 So in no particular order, here we go, starting this week with my fact, and that is that early ice skating rinks stink of pig fat.

8
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:41,880
 - What? - It's a rank rink.

9
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:50,960
 - Rank rink, ice rink. - So this is the fact that the very first artificial skating rinks used as kind of ice substitute,

10
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:55,080
 because they didn't have the technology to make proper fake ice.

11
00:00:55,080 --> 00:01:04,120
 So instead, they used a substitute which consisted of various salts and hoglard and people would skate around on it.

12
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:07,760
 And they also had mounds of hoglard just at the side to look like fake snow.

13
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:11,560
 Yeah, and it didn't last very long. It lasted six or seven months.

14
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:14,440
 - When did you say that was? - That was in 1844.

15
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:18,840
 Okay, so that was, and the first one of those was made in 1841, I think, wasn't it?

16
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:22,240
 - Yes, sorry. So this was the first one that was properly open to the public.

17
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:27,480
 - Yeah, the one that was made in 1841 was only six foot by 12 foot, so I don't think.

18
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:29,680
 - You're not going to play much hockey on that, I mean.

19
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:36,440
 - That was like his investment lure at one. So he made that first one, and it was basically like the thing you'd take on Dragon's Den to say,

20
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:40,280
 "If you give me Â£10,000 for 10% of the company."

21
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:44,680
 - Well, I'm afraid it smells like pig fat, so I'm out.

22
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:47,640
 - It's weird when you see pictures of the olden days.

23
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:52,680
 So for instance, there's this beautiful picture of one of these early ice rinks from the 1840s,

24
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:58,560
 and everyone always looks very kind of, they're all dressed very beautifully, and it always looks lovely, like Jane Austen era,

25
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,560
 and you can never see the picture of the smell, which was so privated everywhere.

26
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:05,120
 Everything smell of horse manure or pig fat.

27
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:10,680
 - Did you expect that they'd be skating around with like clothes pegs on their noses or stuff like that?

28
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:13,040
 - Green smoke, lingering above them.

29
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:17,000
 - Yeah, you can't see the trotters poking up through the ice.

30
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,880
 - Do you remember last year when in Japan, I think we might have mentioned this on our new show in Japan,

31
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:25,040
 they filled that ice rink with dead fish, didn't they?

32
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:27,160
 They got like panties with a dead fish.

33
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:32,040
 - I look this up again, but I didn't realise at the time when you did this on the show that the Japanese theme park

34
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:34,880
 is called Space World, and it's like a space themed theme park.

35
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:37,840
 There's no reason to put fish inside your ice rink.

36
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:42,640
 - They froze them fast so that you get a kind of whole shoulder fish mid-swim, so it did look quite cool,

37
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:45,720
 but then they also spelt out the word "hello" and dead fish.

38
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:48,600
 - When you take a step back from that, that's like, what are you doing?

39
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:52,760
 Who thought that was a good idea, how far down the meeting did you lose sight that that was mad

40
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:56,200
 when you were like, let's spell out the word "hello" of all words in the ice?

41
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:58,680
 - At the very least, you could put "hello" in Japanese.

42
00:02:58,680 --> 00:02:59,680
 - Oh, was it in English?

43
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,080
 - Yeah, it wasn't English, wasn't it?

44
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:01,760
 - It was, yeah.

45
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,800
 - But they got a massive trouble over that, and then they said, don't worry,

46
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:09,400
 the fish were already dead before we put them in the ice as though that sort of makes it better.

47
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:13,400
 - Well, it kind of makes it better, because then it's just like if they were just buying it up as if to eat.

48
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:17,640
 - But people complained at the time that the fish looked like they'd been frozen in time,

49
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:19,880
 they were people saying, it looks like you've just put them in there alive,

50
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:23,080
 and they've frozen to death, because their mouths are open and their eyes are big and wide.

51
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:26,120
 But if you've ever been to a fishmonger, that is just what dead fish look like.

52
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:28,520
 - I see what you mean, I don't think it's better, I do think it's less bad.

53
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,720
 - Well, that's what that means.

54
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:32,520
 - Well, I think it's still bad.

55
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:34,840
 - Do you think, because it was spelled out in English, maybe they thought

56
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:37,880
 this is a kind of weird stuff that the Brits are into, isn't it?

57
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:40,520
 We'll spell it out in their language, we'll get loads of tourists.

58
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:44,760
 - Well, they correctly surmised that it was going to be in British tabloid newspapers, didn't they?

59
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:45,800
 - They did, well done, Japan.

60
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:48,840
 - Yeah, maybe they were hoping that it was going to be in Hello Magazine.

61
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:53,080
 Maybe it was sponsored by Hello Magazine.

62
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:58,200
 - Anyway, yeah, so they didn't have another proper artificial ice rink until 1876,

63
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,200
 and that was when they had actually developed the technology.

64
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:03,800
 But even that one had a layer of cow hair under the ice.

65
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,000
 - Did it?

66
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,400
 Was that for some kind of sort of cold insulation?

67
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:10,280
 Because they ran cold types under the ice, didn't they?

68
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:13,160
 - You had concrete, the base layer is concrete, and then on top of that,

69
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:16,200
 you have layers of earth and wood and cow hair, obviously.

70
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,800
 And then they, on top of that, as you say,

71
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:20,920
 and they put these pipes, and they ran a chemical solution through the pipes,

72
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:25,480
 which froze the water surrounding the pipes, and it froze the water.

73
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,120
 - Yeah, what was that?

74
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:26,760
 - That was really cool.

75
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:28,680
 - They were called Galiciaerians, weren't they?

76
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:29,160
 - Yeah.

77
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,200
 - Galiciaeria, maybe.

78
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,240
 But they were incredible.

79
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:35,000
 I didn't realise these things existed, and they were, it sounds amazing.

80
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,280
 So they were floating.

81
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:41,240
 There was, I think the second or the third one that this guy, John Gange, who invented them made,

82
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:44,760
 was one, a floating one on the tenths, just where the hunger for bridges.

83
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:49,400
 So it was this big floating ice rink, and it had a glass ceiling that went all over it.

84
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:51,880
 So it was indoors, glass ceilinged, floating.

85
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:52,920
 Why don't we still have this?

86
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:53,960
 - That's very cool.

87
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:54,680
 - Yeah.

88
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:57,400
 - I find it fun enough to skate on an ice rink that's on solid ground,

89
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:00,520
 but one that's also, like, you get a seasick on as well, let's go out and down.

90
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:01,480
 - Maybe it cancels out.

91
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,600
 - And it's just like walking around.

92
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:05,000
 - I think I'm imagining everybody sliding to one end,

93
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,360
 and then sliding to the other end, and always getting bunched up on one side.

94
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,320
 - Yeah.

95
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:13,640
 So John Gange, then, after doing this, he went into perpetual motion.

96
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:20,040
 He invented a thing called the Xerometer, which supposedly would power ships through perpetual motion.

97
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:25,720
 He put the same, a similar kind of liquid through the ship, which is really cold.

98
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,320
 That would take the heat from the water.

99
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:33,160
 That would propel the sails and the rotors, which would then put energy back into the water.

100
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:37,800
 And that would supposedly be a perpetual motion machine, unfortunately, it didn't work.

101
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:40,120
 - Unfortunately, he didn't count on the laws of physics.

102
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:43,960
 - And he spent the rest of his life and all of his money on that.

103
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:45,160
 - You're calm.

104
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:45,960
 - Yeah.

105
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:49,560
 - He was an extremely accomplished vet, John Gange.

106
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:52,280
 So he was really good at this.

107
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:55,000
 He founded this vet school and a vet journal.

108
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,880
 And there's now the John Gange award, which is basically the only remnant that has his name,

109
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:03,640
 which is an award that's given to those who excel in the field of veterinary science.

110
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:07,720
 - And it says in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography that if he'd have carried on

111
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:12,600
 being a vet instead of going into ice skating rinks and perpetual motion,

112
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:16,360
 then he probably would have been the best vet of all time, maybe, or one of the best vets.

113
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:21,160
 - But we wouldn't have ice rinks, so swings and roundabouts, isn't it?

114
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:24,440
 - But we would have the pig rink still. He didn't invent that.

115
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:26,120
 - We'd still have the pig rink, thank God.

116
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,560
 - So that would be probably fine.

117
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:33,960
 - Can I just cause such a cool thing about Gange is that his brother was a guy called Sampson Gange.

118
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:34,920
 - Samp Gange?

119
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:41,320
 - Well, so Sampson Gange was a doctor, and he invented a kind of tissue that was used in

120
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:44,360
 surgical instruments, which people called the Gange tissue.

121
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:48,920
 But Tolkien wrote a letter saying that he'd got the name Samwise Gange from that,

122
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:51,800
 because they used to refer to the Gange tissue at the end of the 19th century.

123
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:56,120
 And it was to go with Rosie Cotton, who's Samwise Gange's wife in Lord of the Rings.

124
00:06:56,120 --> 00:07:00,200
 So this guy invented the ice rink, his brother was Samwise Gange.

125
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,000
 - That's amazing.

126
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,400
 - He was Lord of the Rings, and the other guy was Lord of the Rings.

127
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:07,800
 - There's not quite true to the text, is it?

128
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,880
 - He's Lord of the Rings, but we'll allow it.

129
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:14,040
 - So, Samp Gange is named after a cloth.

130
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:16,760
 - Yeah. - And his wife were both named after surgical instruments.

131
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:20,040
 - That's so funny. Surely that's a bit of a hack move, isn't it?

132
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,960
 - It's like the least Lord of the Rings thing to do.

133
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:24,200
 You think of being able to do some God or something, yeah.

134
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,880
 - It's like being called Trevor Gors.

135
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:29,960
 - So, never butterfly stitch.

136
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:35,240
 - What if all the characters in Lord of the Rings are named after all this stuff?

137
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,520
 - Maybe they are.

138
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:37,000
 - Maybe they are.

139
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:44,760
 - So, we should talk about the machines that go up and down ice rinks, fixing the ice.

140
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:45,960
 - That's what the public are crying at.

141
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:49,800
 - You mean, Zambezi's?

142
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:50,600
 - Zambezi's?

143
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,240
 - Zambonis.

144
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,200
 - Zambezi's?

145
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,880
 - Zambezi is a river in Africa.

146
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:55,480
 Very rarely freezes.

147
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:59,080
 - I assume they were named after that.

148
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:00,840
 - Yeah. Sorry, you mean Zambonis.

149
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:01,560
 - Yeah, I do.

150
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,240
 - Yeah, of course they're huge here.

151
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:06,280
 - That's very optimistic that I'm going to edit that.

152
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:12,840
 - Yeah, I didn't realise the previous procedure, which was so laborious.

153
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:16,680
 You had a tractor on the ice, and that would pull along a scraper.

154
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:19,320
 Because obviously, as people skate, there are all these little shavings that get

155
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:20,920
 sort of cut out of the ice.

156
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:22,600
 So, you have a tractor pulling along a scraper.

157
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:25,640
 The scraper scrapes it all up, and then you have to have someone walking behind

158
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:30,040
 spraying the ice with water, and then squeegeeing it up to mop it up.

159
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:33,080
 So, you don't have too much water on the ice, I don't know.

160
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:35,560
 - I think it's basically shaving the top layer off the ice.

161
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:38,760
 So, you've got the smoothness, and then putting a new layer on that's just smooth.

162
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:40,920
 It's basically like repainting, but with water.

163
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:41,400
 - Yeah.

164
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:43,960
 - But then, does the person walking behind leave a lot of footprint in the ice at then?

165
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:46,200
 Another machine has to come behind to sweep up.

166
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,680
 - It's another person, actually, with slightly smaller feet.

167
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,320
 - Yeah, they're great.

168
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:55,960
 So, these are apparently a big deal in the world of ice hockey,

169
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:59,400
 which I'm not very afraid with, and in America, but they're invented by

170
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:02,200
 this guy called Frank Zamboni in 1949.

171
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:05,720
 And they were first made out of Old World War II parts, weren't they?

172
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:07,720
 So, the first one was made out of bits of a...

173
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:08,680
 - Spitfire.

174
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:10,200
 - Is it a tank, wasn't it?

175
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,200
 - It was a Douglas bomber, so it was an aeroplane.

176
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,960
 But I think other bits were made out of tanks, maybe.

177
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,720
 - I think the whole thing was that when he made the machinery,

178
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:18,280
 he'd then put it on like a military buggy and drove it around,

179
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,560
 and that was like, it was like a...

180
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:20,440
 - Ah, really?

181
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:21,320
 - That's so funny.

182
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:24,680
 - I went on the website, and the official website, Zamboni.

183
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:26,520
 And on the biography, it says,

184
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:28,120
 "If necessity is a modern invention,

185
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:31,880
 Frank Zamboni is probably the father, which I think is a bit of a semi..."

186
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:35,480
 You say, "One successful, quite specific invention."

187
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:37,560
 - No, have you seen the other things he invented?

188
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:38,200
 - Go on.

189
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:40,120
 - One of them's called a black widow.

190
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:43,960
 It's a machine that's invented to fill in the dirt on top of symmetry vault.

191
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:48,280
 - Effectively, leveling the soil on top of a vault

192
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:50,600
 is very similar to leveling the ice on a...

193
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,800
 - Yeah, it's a simple one-trick pony.

194
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,240
 - He's not a one-trick pony.

195
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:54,200
 - He's a dad-trick.

196
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,080
 - A dad-trick.

197
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:58,120
 - Because he's also invented the Astro Zamboni,

198
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:00,440
 which removes rainwater from Astro turf.

199
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:03,240
 And when they had the 50th birthday of the Zamboni proper,

200
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:07,000
 Zamboni classic, they had a Zamboni driver of the year competition.

201
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,920
 - Yeah.

202
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:11,480
 - Which was one by a guy called Jim McNeill,

203
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:14,840
 who said it was a thrill right up there with getting married and having children.

204
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:19,000
 Did you see what he did next?

205
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,440
 - Obviously, you got divorced.

206
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,320
 - Get divorced.

207
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:24,520
 - Abandoned his children.

208
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:27,720
 - Actually, it was a bigger thrill.

209
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:30,520
 - Just packing all this stuff up and driving around a Zamboni.

210
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:34,440
 - In 2006, two skating rink workers were fired

211
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:37,480
 after driving a Zamboni to a Burger King drive-through.

212
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:42,680
 They got fired immediately, and the director of parks said,

213
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:45,960
 "When we interview them, they didn't seem to be too concerned about it."

214
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,240
 "Did they leave the Burger King floor extremely smooth?"

215
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,360
 - I don't know.

216
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:50,760
 - I don't know.

217
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:52,680
 - I wish we moved on, guys.

218
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:53,160
 - Yeah.

219
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:56,360
 - Oh, can I tell you a really cool thing you can do with ice super quickly?

220
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:59,480
 If you get a bit of cheese wire and you hang weights on either side of it,

221
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:01,160
 and you get a big block of ice,

222
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:03,080
 so like make a big block of ice, bit of cheese wire,

223
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:06,440
 hang two liter bottles of water on either side of the cheese wire,

224
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,640
 and you put it over the ice.

225
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:09,720
 So it gradually cuts through it, yeah?

226
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:14,760
 And the ice re-freezes behind the cheese wire as it cuts through it.

227
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:18,200
 So the cheese wire will cut all the way through the ice, come out the other end,

228
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:20,280
 and you've got a completely intact block of ice.

229
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,000
 - That's amazing.

230
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,480
 So you spend all that time and all of your objects are exactly the same as they were when you started.

231
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:27,480
 - Hopefully it's almost a food dialect.

232
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:40,040
 - Okay, it's time for fact number two, and that is Anna.

233
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:42,280
 - Yeah, my fact this week is that in 1912,

234
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:45,320
 the Toronto government ran a fly swatting competition.

235
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:49,080
 It was one by a 15-year-old girl who killed half a million flies.

236
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:53,000
 - So, so weird, it's...

237
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,560
 I think I read about this on a site called Knowledge Nuts,

238
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:57,400
 which I think it's covered in it.

239
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:58,760
 It's a really great site, guys.

240
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:01,480
 I felt like I had to mention it, because it's not in many other places.

241
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:04,440
 So this is this contest that flies were a massive problem in 1912.

242
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:06,760
 They spread lots of disease, there was manure everywhere,

243
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:09,000
 there were big piles of rubbish everywhere in the streets.

244
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:09,960
 - So that wasn't the flies.

245
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:12,200
 - I was going to say, the flies aren't causing the manure.

246
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:16,200
 - They're going to cause very small amounts of manure.

247
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,360
 - Yeah, so they're writing to the problem, I would say.

248
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:20,440
 - Well, actually they aren't they doing the eat manure,

249
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:22,360
 and then they produce a different type of manure.

250
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:24,520
 - What's interesting about that is they take manure,

251
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:26,200
 and then they replace it with manure.

252
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,800
 It's very much like Anna's ice.

253
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:31,480
 - They redistribute manure.

254
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:33,800
 They're redistributing manure on people.

255
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:37,320
 The government didn't like it, and so the Chief Medical Officer

256
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:40,520
 in the Toronto government got together with the Daily Star,

257
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:42,040
 launched this contest.

258
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:45,640
 Every contestant had to be under 16, and they said they give away cash prizes

259
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:48,040
 to the children who brought in the most fly corpses.

260
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:51,000
 And there were people who came, and they came to the,

261
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,360
 this guy called Dr. Hastings, who was the Chief Medical Officer,

262
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:57,080
 and they brought their fly corpses to him every day,

263
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,280
 and he counted them up.

264
00:12:58,280 --> 00:12:59,800
 And there were lots of quite strict rules,

265
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:02,520
 so you couldn't try and pad out your pint with other material.

266
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:03,960
 That was against the rules.

267
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:06,920
 You couldn't breed the flies once you got them in order to make more,

268
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:09,000
 because that kind of defeats that whole object.

269
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,600
 How do they know you're not going to do that, though?

270
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:11,320
 - Exactly.

271
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:12,840
 - They just asked you not to.

272
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:13,800
 It was on trust.

273
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,640
 - That's like, what city was it in China,

274
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:19,080
 that started offering a bounty for every mouse,

275
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:21,000
 or rat tail or something?

276
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,920
 - Yeah, I know people just made rat farms,

277
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:25,480
 and then just like, but brain mass bred these rats.

278
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:26,280
 - It's quite crafty.

279
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:28,200
 - The idea of padding it out with other stuff, though.

280
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:30,200
 Because that's in a Greek myth, isn't it?

281
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:32,520
 Someone, you know, the someone is going to pay the gods some tribute,

282
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,120
 and he puts in the sack of rubbish awful,

283
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,720
 but then he puts a nice steak on top of it,

284
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:37,320
 and the gods think, oh, it's sack of steak,

285
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:39,640
 and then they work it out, because they're not complete idiots.

286
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:42,760
 - There was an old scam that they used to do with vegetable oil,

287
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:46,760
 in that they'd sell you a massive tank of vegetable oil.

288
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:49,560
 But actually, it would be water with oil on top of it,

289
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:52,360
 because of course, oil flow, and you don't see the oil part.

290
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:55,800
 - And that is why cooking oil now always comes in transparent bottles.

291
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,720
 You've got to see it all the way down.

292
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:01,320
 So we've established that piling rubbish underneath

293
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:03,480
 and putting the valuable thing on top is a common trope,

294
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:07,240
 and the Toronto government anticipated this, and said please don't do it kids.

295
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:09,000
 - Why was the competition only for 16 and younger?

296
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,520
 If this is a genuine problem, they were trying to solve.

297
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:12,680
 Why would they then suddenly, we only want youth involved?

298
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:13,880
 - People have got jobs, Alex.

299
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:16,760
 - Well, kids, have school.

300
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:18,200
 I bet this girl, Beatrice White,

301
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:20,120
 skived a lot of school to get this good.

302
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:21,400
 So this is the girl who won it,

303
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:23,240
 and she set these proper traps,

304
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:25,160
 and if you look up, if you go to old newspaper archives,

305
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:26,360
 you can see pictures.

306
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:29,800
 They're quite elaborate, so she put raw liver underneath them,

307
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,560
 and she designed a one-way funnel,

308
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:34,680
 and then she'd agitate fly, so they flew towards the raw liver,

309
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:35,880
 it went through the one-way funnel,

310
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:37,400
 and then they'd get stuck in these contraptions,

311
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:38,920
 she'd built out of wood and wire,

312
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,920
 and then she'd collect them at the end of every day,

313
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:44,520
 and she'd delivered 500,000 flies to the government.

314
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:45,800
 - It's amazing.

315
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:47,640
 - She killed them with poisonous, well, didn't she?

316
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:48,200
 - Yeah.

317
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,880
 - I wonder what poison kills flies.

318
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:51,560
 - Ooh, I know one.

319
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:52,600
 - What? - Arsenic.

320
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:53,400
 - How does that?

321
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:56,200
 - Because fly paper used to be full of arsenic.

322
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:59,640
 And people would soak fly paper in water,

323
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:02,920
 let the poison leak out, and then you'd have poisonous water,

324
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:05,800
 and people would, people murdered each other in the 19th century,

325
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,240
 with fly paper water.

326
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:09,240
 - Today? - Yeah, you'd say, have a nice glass of water.

327
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:11,720
 - There's one called Florence Maybrook in 1889,

328
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:13,160
 who poisoned a husband who was convicted

329
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:15,480
 of arsenic poisoning a husband using fly paper.

330
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:16,680
 - Really?

331
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:20,680
 - Oh, yeah, but didn't she claim that he liked to self-medicate

332
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:22,680
 with arsenic for his libido?

333
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:23,960
 And there wasn't enough evidence either way,

334
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:26,280
 so she escaped being executed for it,

335
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:27,960
 but she did stay in prison for a long time.

336
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:30,440
 - That's a whole crime work, that's a whole thing.

337
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:32,200
 We think you did it, we're not totally sure,

338
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:34,040
 so we're sort of going to go for a piece of a sentence,

339
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:35,240
 but not a full one.

340
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:39,240
 - What they should have done is stuck her odds of fly paper for 20 years.

341
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:44,120
 - If she was a Greek parable, that would have been what they had done.

342
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:46,600
 - My husband and life actually liked shooting himself.

343
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:48,920
 Was it for his libido?

344
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:53,000
 - Well, they did used to use arsenic in some medicines, I think,

345
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,040
 didn't they? Tiny amounts.

346
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:56,280
 So maybe, yeah, it's plausible, I believe her.

347
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:01,320
 So for many years, in many places, collecting flies

348
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:03,400
 and giving them to the government has gotten you money.

349
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:14,280
 So in China, officials in Luai Yang offered $125 per 2000 dead flies during a campaign.

350
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:17,240
 Each fly was worth about seven cents.

351
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:19,160
 - Was that a massive amount for a fly?

352
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:20,520
 - Yeah, it is, it's a recent, sorry.

353
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:21,800
 - That was quite recently, yeah.

354
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:25,560
 In Pennsylvania, in Mansfield, Pennsylvania, in 1914,

355
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:28,520
 it was five cents per pint of flies.

356
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:35,480
 You would get, in 1988 in Manila, it was $4.75 per 1000 flies.

357
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:38,360
 So all the prices are very different.

358
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:38,760
 - Yeah.

359
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:40,360
 - And there was a guy called Mr. Bellen.

360
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:46,120
 - About whom James has nothing interesting to say.

361
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:47,880
 He just doesn't really want me to get that name in.

362
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:53,640
 - It would be great because he was collecting flies.

363
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:57,800
 It would be great if his name became a verb to collect flies.

364
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:59,960
 I Bellen, he Bellen, he Bellen.

365
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:05,480
 No, he was delivering an average of 200,000 dead flies per week,

366
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:07,720
 making about $1,000 a week.

367
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:08,440
 - Wow.

368
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:09,880
 - How was he doing that?

369
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:12,120
 - Well, he wouldn't give away his tricks.

370
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:13,960
 And what tools was he using?

371
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:17,160
 Well, people suggested that he was hatching maggots himself.

372
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:19,480
 An allegation he denied, vehemently.

373
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:21,720
 - Well, you would do, wouldn't you, with $1,000 a week?

374
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:25,480
 - He said that catching flies are a lot like hunting or fishing.

375
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:27,800
 You, first of all, you have to find out where they hang out,

376
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:28,760
 and then you go there.

377
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:33,080
 And he used a giant fly swatter which he invented himself.

378
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:36,600
 - When he say invented, was it just a fly spot, but much bigger?

379
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:39,320
 - He wouldn't give anything more away in the article that I read.

380
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:42,200
 - Just, you said that to catch them, you have to go to where they are.

381
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:42,680
 - Yeah.

382
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:48,680
 - So, the second place in this competition in Toronto in 1912

383
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:52,360
 went to a girl who lived quite near a 90-meter-long heap of manure.

384
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:55,400
 - She knows.

385
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:58,280
 - She never thought that would be an asset for the parents of buying the house.

386
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:00,840
 - And so much with the fly catcher competition.

387
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:03,240
 I can actually afford a slightly larger heap of manure now.

388
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:07,320
 But they ran the competition the next year.

389
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:11,240
 They ran it for a second time, and there weren't any flies to catch.

390
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:13,160
 Because Beatrice White had scooped them all up.

391
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:16,200
 But her sister came second following year.

392
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:19,080
 - And she still, her sister still caught 200,000 or something?

393
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:21,640
 - No, she got 50,000, nothing.

394
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:23,080
 There's still a lot of flies.

395
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:26,840
 - Newspaper, the Toronto, I think it's the Toronto star.

396
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:27,080
 - Yeah.

397
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:30,200
 - The Toronto star in Toronto, they tracked down Beatrice White,

398
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,960
 who would have been about 71, I think.

399
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:35,240
 And they ran a headline, "The Queen of Fly Killers Found Alive."

400
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:38,840
 And they gave her a count of insecticide to thank her.

401
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:39,400
 - Yeah.

402
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:42,600
 And she said that the 50 dollars that she'd won,

403
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:44,680
 she desperately wanted it to pay for her music lessons,

404
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:46,120
 and her dad had kept it for himself.

405
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:47,480
 - Really?

406
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:49,320
 - Yeah, tough times.

407
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:50,360
 - That is bad.

408
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:54,600
 - I think each housefly can carry 6.6 billion,

409
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,760
 sorry, obviously not billion.

410
00:18:56,760 --> 00:19:00,680
 Each housefly can carry 6.6 million bacteria on it.

411
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:01,640
 Many of which are bad.

412
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:02,600
 I know some are good.

413
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,120
 We all end up with a yackled advert.

414
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:05,320
 But some of them are bad.

415
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:06,520
 - You wouldn't have passed down a pint of flies

416
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:09,800
 in the vague hope that some of the bacteria might be friendly.

417
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:13,480
 I gotta say, though, the difference between a million and a billion,

418
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:16,920
 it's like, it's hardly as if, "Oh, thank God it's only a million."

419
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:21,800
 - I wasn't thinking, "Don't be ridiculous, Alan."

420
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:22,840
 They couldn't have a billion.

421
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:23,880
 They must have a million.

422
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:26,440
 - It seemed silly to me.

423
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:39,560
 Okay, it's time for fact number three.

424
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:41,160
 And that is Alex.

425
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:46,440
 My fact this week is that when animating 101 Dalmatians,

426
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:48,040
 Disney photocopied the dogs.

427
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:50,840
 - Is that why they're black and white?

428
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:54,440
 - Was that of the office party after the shooter then did?

429
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:56,200
 - We photocopied our bums.

430
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:56,920
 What else can we do?

431
00:19:56,920 --> 00:20:01,400
 - Do you know who first came up with the idea of photographing your body parts?

432
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:01,880
 - No.

433
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:03,240
 - A genius of some sort.

434
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:05,560
 - Yes, Einstein.

435
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:06,920
 - No, Andy Warhol.

436
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:07,320
 - Really?

437
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:11,880
 - Apparently, it seems like he was possibly the first person to do it.

438
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:15,800
 In 1969, he walked into an art supply store and he knew the owner,

439
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:17,400
 who's called Donald Havanek.

440
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:21,320
 And he convinced him to let him do some photocopying of himself.

441
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:24,680
 And there are images of him with his face on a photocopier.

442
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:26,280
 He didn't do his bum as far as I know.

443
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:28,680
 - I would wish that the first person to do that,

444
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:31,480
 knowing that human condition would have been the person who invented the photocopier

445
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,600
 moments after inventing it.

446
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:34,920
 Because that's going to be the first thing you ever do in the photocopier.

447
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:35,960
 - I don't know.

448
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:39,400
 What I would be impressed by, because everyone now has photocopied parts of

449
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:41,560
 themselves using the flatbed on a photocopier.

450
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:44,600
 I want to see the person who photocopied himself using the document feeder.

451
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:50,040
 - That'd be amazing, yeah.

452
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:50,760
 - Yeah.

453
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:51,880
 - Sliding yourself through.

454
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:53,720
 - What do you mean they photocopied the dog?

455
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:55,560
 - So this was in the late 50s.

456
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:59,080
 Disney had made Sleeping Beauty and the way that they made that was that every

457
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:02,120
 single frame of the film has to be really painstakingly drawn

458
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:06,120
 and then transferred onto painted onto glass cells.

459
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:08,360
 And this is a really expensive and time consuming process.

460
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:09,880
 And then it didn't do very well at the box office.

461
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:12,120
 So Disney was thinking of shutting down their animation offices.

462
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:15,560
 So they had to come up with cheaper ways of making these films.

463
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:21,000
 And so one of the creatives at Disney got some equipment from Xerox

464
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:26,120
 and modified it and found a way of basically photocopying certain elements of the drawings

465
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:28,360
 and putting them onto the glass cells.

466
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:33,080
 So they then next made 101 Dalmatians and realised that they could specifically photocopy

467
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:35,720
 the spots on the dogs because they're going to stay the same.

468
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:39,560
 And you need the same different combination of spots on each dog.

469
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:41,400
 And it needs to be the same dog and stay the same.

470
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,080
 And then the background thing to say the same.

471
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:47,480
 And they came up with this way of identifying the dogs by thinking of the spots as constellations.

472
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:50,840
 And it costed about half as much the film as it would have done.

473
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:54,680
 And kind of say Disney and then transformed the way that they would animate films

474
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:56,680
 from then on until the computer year.

475
00:21:56,680 --> 00:22:01,160
 Does that mean all the spots on the dogs are constellations?

476
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:03,560
 No, they're just, they were thought of like constellations.

477
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:05,000
 Okay, I don't remember them.

478
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,840
 It does mean that it would have been like three Dalmatians if they didn't have Xerox intelligent.

479
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:12,840
 She just made a tiny, tiny little glove out of it.

480
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:18,920
 Maybe the Xerox machine only did 100 copies as maximum.

481
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:24,680
 Do you know what toner is made of in photocopiers?

482
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:25,720
 Is it pig fat?

483
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:26,920
 It's pig fat.

484
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:27,640
 Is it great?

485
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:28,360
 No, of course not.

486
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:30,280
 It's different from ink, isn't it?

487
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:31,320
 There's a difference between toner and ink.

488
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:32,600
 It's not ink, yeah.

489
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:35,800
 It's like electrostatically charged particles.

490
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:36,840
 Oh, you do know what it is.

491
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:38,760
 Yeah, well, it's, it is.

492
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:42,440
 But it's, there's incredibly fine powder.

493
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:43,880
 Yeah, some of it, a lot of it's rust.

494
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:44,760
 Rust.

495
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:45,720
 Iron oxide, yeah.

496
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:46,920
 And they're plastic as well, right?

497
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:48,120
 And there's lots of plastic.

498
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:51,880
 Modern color photocopy toner is 95% plastic.

499
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:54,200
 Milled into a tiny, tiny, tiny powder,

500
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:56,680
 which then gets fused by heat with the paper.

501
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:57,960
 Okay.

502
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:58,680
 I had no idea.

503
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:00,200
 The photocopy toner is not ink.

504
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:01,560
 That's why it's so expensive.

505
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:02,280
 Yeah.

506
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:05,000
 Because you always see that it's like 10 times more expensive

507
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,320
 than champagne or something, don't you?

508
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:07,720
 Yeah.

509
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,480
 And it is done by electromagnetism, isn't it?

510
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:11,400
 So I think it's a really complicated process.

511
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:14,280
 But you make the bits that you want to have toner on

512
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:15,320
 be kind of magnetic.

513
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:17,240
 And then it attracts the toner to it.

514
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:18,520
 So it needs to be charged.

515
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:21,480
 So the toner has the opposite charge to the bits of the paper.

516
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:22,280
 That's amazing, isn't it?

517
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:22,760
 Do you know this?

518
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:23,720
 I didn't know this.

519
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:26,520
 Do you know that Canon has been warning people

520
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:29,320
 to take better care of their office equipment?

521
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:30,600
 It's how they put it.

522
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:31,720
 This is what I'm seeing it.

523
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:34,120
 But especially during the festive season,

524
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:38,120
 it says the Christmas season leaves to 25% hike in service calls

525
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:40,680
 due to incidents such as backside copying pranks.

526
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:45,400
 So there is actually a big increase in photocopier accidents

527
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:46,440
 during the festive seasons.

528
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:48,440
 They've asked us to stop doing it, please.

529
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:49,240
 Well, I won't.

530
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:52,920
 I don't know what those squares at Canon have to say.

531
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:55,320
 And he just replies to the last with 20 copies of his own.

532
00:23:55,320 --> 00:24:00,360
 Do you know, using a lot of people use Xerox, especially in America,

533
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:03,480
 as a generic word for a photocopier?

534
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:04,680
 Yes.

535
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:09,240
 And according to an advert from 2003, Xerox said,

536
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:12,520
 when you use Xerox, the way you use aspirin, we get a headache.

537
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:15,640
 And that they really hate the way people do this.

538
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:18,840
 And the reason being is something called generic side.

539
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:22,280
 And what it is, is it's when you have your brand becoming

540
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:24,600
 so ubiquitous that everyone uses it.

541
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:28,600
 It means that you can't really claim intellectual property over that word.

542
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:31,320
 And so it means your trademark is basically dead and buried.

543
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:31,560
 Yeah.

544
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:32,760
 And that's why Google don't like you say.

545
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:33,560
 I'm going to Google it.

546
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:37,000
 They want you to say, I'm going to search it online using google.com

547
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:37,560
 or Velcro.

548
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:38,600
 They don't like to be called Velcro.

549
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:40,200
 Obviously, there are advantages to that

550
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:42,200
 because you become a very famous brand.

551
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:45,720
 But then at the same time, it's very difficult to protect your trademark.

552
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:47,240
 I mean, it hasn't worked for Google, for instance.

553
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:48,360
 Where are they now?

554
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:49,400
 Yeah.

555
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:51,400
 Crushed under the Ask Jeaves juggernaut.

556
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:56,680
 There was a bug in 2013 in Xerox machines which meant that

557
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:59,400
 sometimes numbers would be randomly replaced and photocopied.

558
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:01,800
 People would be photocopy really important documents.

559
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:03,480
 And then I think falls would change the ones.

560
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:05,320
 And then this guy--

561
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:07,400
 That explains 404 Dalmatians.

562
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:12,200
 The guy did like a TED talk on it and kind of revealed this bug.

563
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:14,280
 And then Xerox took him on board and fixed the bug.

564
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:15,320
 Wow.

565
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:16,040
 Yeah.

566
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:16,520
 That's good.

567
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:17,160
 That's amazing.

568
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:17,800
 Okay.

569
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:24,200
 So the guy who invented the photocopier or the Xerox is so nice.

570
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:26,600
 It's a really happy story.

571
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:29,720
 It's just from a start to finish.

572
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:31,640
 This guy's called Chester Carlson.

573
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:34,200
 And he was brought up really poor.

574
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:37,640
 So he used to have to sleep in a chicken coop sometimes.

575
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:39,800
 He spent some time having to sleep outside.

576
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:40,840
 Where did the chicken sleep?

577
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:43,240
 They slept in his full poster bed upstairs.

578
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:49,800
 But he came up with this amazing technology,

579
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:50,920
 which was really complicated.

580
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:52,120
 And when people talk about it,

581
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:54,120
 combined loads of different techniques

582
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:55,960
 that no one had ever thought of combining before.

583
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:58,120
 And was rejected by more than 20 companies.

584
00:25:58,120 --> 00:26:00,280
 And it's since been called like the most important thing

585
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:02,360
 to happen in printing since the printing press.

586
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:05,640
 Because his technology also was what laser printers do.

587
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:08,600
 So he basically came up with modern printing and photocopying.

588
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:10,200
 But he eventually--

589
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:11,880
 you know when you expect to get to the end of these stories,

590
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:14,600
 it'd be like, oh, he sold the rights to someone and got a tenor.

591
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:16,440
 He then went into perpetual motion.

592
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:20,520
 Didn't stop spinning for the rest of his life.

593
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:25,880
 He got a 16th of a cent for every single Xerox copy made

594
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:27,240
 throughout 1965.

595
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:28,440
 Which was a lot.

596
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:30,280
 That's why it's so expensive.

597
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:32,680
 No, as long as that is about 10 years, the period.

598
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:35,240
 Through 21965, yes, from when he made it.

599
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:36,760
 But he lived really humbly.

600
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:39,240
 And he never bought much staff.

601
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:40,680
 He gave all of his money away.

602
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:42,600
 He would never ever wanted his name to be on staff.

603
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:44,760
 So when he gave his money to universities and stuff,

604
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:48,680
 he asked them to put it in honor of the teacher who'd inspired him and things like that.

605
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:50,280
 Is it possible that that was just cover story

606
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:52,040
 and that what he did was he invented a photocopie

607
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:53,320
 and then just photocopied money?

608
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:55,800
 No one really caught up with him for years.

609
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:56,600
 Well, it effectively is.

610
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:57,400
 It's printing, isn't it?

611
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:58,280
 Basically printing money, yeah.

612
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:02,760
 A 16th of a cent for every Xerox copy made is unbelievable.

613
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:03,640
 Yeah, that's the same.

614
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:05,720
 Yeah, but I know you're right.

615
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:06,520
 He gave it all away.

616
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:08,920
 But he had a business partner at the start.

617
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:13,400
 He was a guy called Otto Kornai, I think he might have been an Austrian, I'm not sure.

618
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:16,040
 But he walked away about a year into the process.

619
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:17,640
 He said, I don't see this going anywhere.

620
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:18,440
 I do.

621
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:20,200
 And he could have been a multi-millionaire.

622
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:21,400
 But, yeah.

623
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:22,280
 I know.

624
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:26,040
 But Chester Carlson, the reason he tried to invent a photocopie in the first place

625
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:29,400
 was because he worked for years as a law student and a patent attorney.

626
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:33,080
 And he spent like all his time copying legal documents by hand

627
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:35,080
 and developed chronic arthritis because of it.

628
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:36,920
 And he was just so pissed off that he had to do this.

629
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:39,480
 That he was like, I need him sheen for this.

630
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:40,520
 Hi.

631
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:42,520
 He did other, he had other inventions.

632
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:44,360
 Uh, there we go.

633
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:45,960
 I'm not sure, I'm not sure.

634
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:47,640
 I'm not sure.

635
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:50,840
 A raincoat with gottas to channel water away from crowds away.

636
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:54,440
 Now, actually, that is a good idea.

637
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:57,560
 He invented a toothbrush with replaceable bristles.

638
00:27:57,560 --> 00:28:01,480
 He invented a transparent toothpaste tube, which seems really unnecessary.

639
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:05,000
 No, I would love that because how does they get the stripes in it?

640
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:09,400
 It's transparent. It means that people can't hide awful inside your toothpaste.

641
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:14,040
 The top millimeter is toothpaste and the rest is just big fat.

642
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:16,440
 The number of times the aquafresh have got me with that trick.

643
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:21,640
 Do you know where photocopying has been banned?

644
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:27,080
 Oh, um, in the, um, in the Bank of England.

645
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:28,680
 Oh, that's a good idea.

646
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:29,640
 North Korea.

647
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:31,880
 Um, it's, well, it may well have been.

648
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:33,800
 I don't know how many photocopies there are in North Korea.

649
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:37,560
 But in 2010, in Tibet, it was banned.

650
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:43,400
 People in the capital would have to register their name if they wanted to make photocopies.

651
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:49,320
 Basically, the Chinese authorities were worried about people spreading literature saying,

652
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:52,280
 "Hey, maybe the Chinese should leave Tibet."

653
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:54,760
 And so they said, "Well, no more photocopying for you."

654
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:58,920
 Fuji has developed a new robotic printer that moves around,

655
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:02,200
 allowing your office, bringing documents to the person who printed them.

656
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:03,400
 That's a great idea.

657
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:04,360
 That's awesome.

658
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:04,760
 Yeah.

659
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:05,960
 I mean, our office is quite small.

660
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:07,080
 I'm not sure how much we get.

661
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:08,840
 And it's got a step in the middle of it.

662
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:09,480
 Yeah.

663
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:15,480
 So if you're in a public space and you have some documents which are quite secure or sensitive

664
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:17,640
 and you want to print them out, you don't want anyone else to see them.

665
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:20,200
 You don't want to print them and then have to go over because there might be someone

666
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:23,960
 who stood there and they might read your, your anti-Chinese propaganda.

667
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:28,760
 And so I'm sorry, I've said sorry about printing that using the office printer, right?

668
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:31,960
 And so if they come to you, then it means that you'll always get the right

669
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:33,000
 once.

670
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:36,520
 I guess, but isn't there a risk that someone intercepted on the way?

671
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:36,920
 Yeah.

672
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:40,440
 You know, if people look at my screen in the concert, they see I'm on free to bet.com.

673
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:45,880
 The sensitive document robot keeps on chopping back and forth to me.

674
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:49,080
 Yeah.

675
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:51,800
 Actually, photocopying is a holding sensitive document.

676
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:55,480
 It's a major issue that there's someone, this guy is trying to highlight.

677
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:58,840
 So I didn't realise this, but every time you photocopy something,

678
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:02,920
 then it stores exactly what your photocopy done a hard drive. So since 2002,

679
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:07,720
 they photocopies have got a record of every single thing that's been through them.

680
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:13,160
 So there's this guy called Jun-Tunen who has a digital security company and he tried to prove how

681
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:18,360
 risky this is by buying randomly buying up some second-hand photocopies. So we bought up four of

682
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:22,600
 them to show that they hold all this digital information. He actually said we didn't even have to

683
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:27,400
 wait for the first one to warm up. One of the copies had documents still on the copy of glass

684
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:31,880
 from the New York Police Department. Oh my god.

685
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:38,040
 What? They didn't even take it out of the thing. They hadn't even take the sex offenders list

686
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:41,640
 of the flatbed in the photocopies. So he opened it up and got that.

687
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:46,280
 But he hacked into the hard drives and he got, for instance, 300 pages of people's individual

688
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:51,560
 medical records. So all details on the medical records. Like blood, blood descriptions, blood test

689
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:57,240
 results, diagnoses. He got lots more lists of sex offenders. He got lists of paystubs and people's

690
00:30:57,240 --> 00:31:03,640
 bank details that they'd photocopied. So yeah, this is a thing. Old photocopies are holding.

691
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:08,280
 Was one of the photocopies he bought from the New York Police Sex Crimes Department,

692
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:10,200
 something like this? It must have been, right? It must have been.

693
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:13,880
 I think it must have been. He probably was waiting, hovering on the eBay button,

694
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:28,440
 breakers and ages. Slam, got it.

695
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:34,600
 Okay, it's time for a final fact and that is James. Okay, my fact this week is that seeds have brains.

696
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:39,880
 And James doesn't. Are the houses under two aren't brains are they? Are they the same?

697
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:45,320
 Well, they're smaller. If I was talking to one of the party, how long would it take me to notice

698
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:52,360
 that I was talking to a seed? I think that you don't, you tend to make that decision not just based

699
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:56,600
 on people's brains. Okay, let's say it's got a face painted on it. He's not talking to people if you

700
00:31:56,600 --> 00:32:02,120
 notice their brain, what if it's not working? I think that guy over there is an ACON. It's anything.

701
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:08,520
 Case I was being rude. So what this is is they've taken some seeds and they've worked out how

702
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:13,160
 they make the decision of when they need to germinate and they've looked at all the different cells and

703
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:18,840
 they found that it's just a few cells that make this decision. And it's very complicated, but the way

704
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:24,120
 they make the decision is quite analogous to the way that animals make decisions with their brains.

705
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:29,720
 And so the people who have done this study are saying that basically it's very similar to a brain,

706
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:35,000
 but much smaller, much simpler, but it's similar. Now that doesn't mean that they have brains like

707
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:41,320
 us because they don't, but it's basically quite interesting because the last time plants and animals

708
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:50,600
 had a common ancestor was like 1.6 million, sorry, stupid. Even though it was that much time,

709
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:55,000
 they've kind of come up with the same solution to the problem, which is by using these cells to

710
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:59,080
 communicate with each other and then saying, okay, now that we've communicated, we're going to

711
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:03,800
 release these hormones, etc. So it's about the cells communicating with each other within the seeds.

712
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:08,600
 Exactly. And that's, I mean, what is a brain apart from a few cells communicating with one another?

713
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:11,480
 Yeah, it's all minus. It's kind of like you guys.

714
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:15,960
 But it kind of sounded like it's slightly, well, in the Oscar, it pulled it down a bit to half of

715
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:19,400
 the cells are saying, like, grow, grow, grow, grow, grow, and the other ones are saying, like, don't

716
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:23,480
 stay, stay here because stay at seed. And it's just up to, like, then it's then deciding which one

717
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:27,720
 to follow. Just like when you're in bed and you're like, stay in bed all day or get up and do stuff.

718
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:35,720
 Yeah. And it's pretty analogous to that because for plant, it can't sprout too early in case the

719
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:40,680
 temperature gets cold again, but it can't wait too late. It can't stay in bed too late because then

720
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:47,640
 all the other seeds will have sprouted and they'll crowd out the results. So it is like that. You

721
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:51,240
 can't get out of bed too early because it'll be dark and you'll get bump into things, but you can't

722
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:57,720
 get out too late, otherwise the tube will be very busy. There was a good headline in New Scientist,

723
00:33:57,720 --> 00:34:05,800
 which is quite misleading that said, it just said, plant parents tell their seeds when to sprout by

724
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:11,640
 passing down their memories. And I thought, this is going to blow this podcast wide, oh, plant up

725
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:16,200
 memories and they transmit their memories to their children. This is unbelievable.

726
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:20,360
 It can't transmit memories to each other. Actually, what it is is, but it is still quite interesting.

727
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:25,480
 So as you say, it's important when seeds sprout and actually sometimes they might want to sprout

728
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:31,720
 earlier, depending on the weather and the plant parent can work out. So if it's warm weather,

729
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:36,040
 it knows that it'll make a slightly thinner casing for its seeds. So it sprouts quickly to

730
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:40,520
 take advantage of the weather, whereas if it's cold weather, the plant senses that and automatically

731
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:45,000
 makes a thick casing for the seed. And that means when it's dispersed, it takes longer to hatch

732
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:49,400
 out and the weather will have got warmer by then. So in a way, that is clever. It is very clever.

733
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:55,480
 But that's like me saying, like, if I put my baby in a hat that I'm passing my memory to it.

734
00:34:55,480 --> 00:35:04,040
 So on plant seeds, you know, organ oil? No. I went to Morocco at the end of last year and they were

735
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:08,200
 banging on and on about organ oil in every single market. They're like, you love organ oil, don't you?

736
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:12,520
 From organ trees. Yeah, organ, or organ. Organ. So it's a thing that's really

737
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:16,760
 popular now, apparently, for girls to use in their hair. It's a, it's a big deal. I can see why you felt

738
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:24,840
 we would know. Look at Andy's hair. That's riddled with organ. It's ripping with organ. I'm hoping

739
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:30,200
 it's actually water that I was sold as organ oil when I was a trainer in Morocco. But anyway,

740
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:34,280
 this is kind of, this is a massive boon. I'm popular it is for places like Morocco, where

741
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:39,400
 it's made. Organ trees were the ones where the goats live. They are. So 60% of organ nuts, which is

742
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:43,720
 where you get organ oil, are distributed by goats. So you're right, organ trees are the ones that

743
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:48,120
 goats climb up and they can get light up to eight metres up a tree. And then they eat the organ

744
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:52,280
 leaves and the fruits and stuff and the seeds. They then regurgitate within about a day and they spit

745
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:57,320
 them out somewhere else. And that's how they're distributed. So this organ oil that you ladies and

746
00:35:57,320 --> 00:36:03,160
 gentlemen are putting on your skinnier hair or whatever it's for, has been dispersed by a tree climbing

747
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:08,600
 goats. That's very cool. I have a fact about those goats. Go on. It's that the domestic ones don't

748
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:13,480
 know how to climb trees. And they have to be taught by keepers, human keepers how to climb.

749
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:19,400
 How do they teach them that? I don't know. I haven't found any footage beyond just that fact.

750
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:25,080
 It's well worth googling organ tree goats, isn't it? Yeah. If you haven't seen that picture before

751
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:30,600
 it's yeah. Or you can watch the special feature of how to do QI research on volume two of the

752
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:35,480
 QI DVD box set, which is all about organ trees and goats. Oh, that's how I must have known that.

753
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:42,920
 That me too, yeah. So elephants transport seeds as well. They can transport seeds up to 65 kilometers

754
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:47,880
 away from the tree that they've eaten, the fruit or whatever. And that's by far the biggest

755
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:53,160
 mover of seeds out for any animal at all. You know, like three times more than any birds or

756
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:57,000
 anything like that, yeah. That's incredible. And it comes out in their feces presumably.

757
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:03,240
 It does. Okay. So they could, they travel 65 kilometers between poos. That's what it sounds like,

758
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:11,160
 doesn't it? I've done that on a motorway before. You transported the seeds from self-mins to

759
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:18,360
 carbie services. Where do you think 75% of Mexico's sesame seeds go?

760
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:24,440
 They go into Andy's car to travel up the other six. They get turned into halva paste.

761
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:28,360
 They go to McDonald's. They do. They will end up on McDonald's bird.

762
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:33,080
 Three quarters of all those sesame seeds in Mexico, I think that's amazing. That is amazing.

763
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:36,280
 Wow. Wow. Oh, what else do you use them for?

764
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:42,360
 It's halva paste. No, what else? Is that another hair product?

765
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:44,760
 It's made. No, it's the use of food. It's a mouth product.

766
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:49,800
 If you put it in your mouth, it's delicious. Is it? Okay, great. I'll look it up.

767
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:53,960
 So it's food then. It's a food. Okay. Yeah, I call it a mouth product.

768
00:37:53,960 --> 00:38:00,440
 I read an article about Mexican farming the other day. It was about the avocado farmers in

769
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:06,680
 various cities. They've now formed their own militias because they were being ripped off

770
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:12,360
 in blackmailed and extorted by gangsters and they have proper assault weapon militias,

771
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:16,920
 concrete bunkers, all this stuff just to protect the avocado crops. It's so valuable to them.

772
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:22,840
 Isn't it avocados though that they would be extinct if it weren't for humans eating them because

773
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:27,480
 they lost the mechanism to distribute their seeds? That is true. It's because avocado seeds are too

774
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:33,080
 large to pass for any animals that are currently extant. So the thing that avocados evolved to be

775
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:38,440
 distributed by has been extinct for 12,000 years with a very large illness. Yeah, it's evolved to be

776
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:46,040
 distributed by Pears Morgan. It was a ground sloth, guys. It was a three-meter-long ground sloth called

777
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:51,640
 the Megalonics Jeffersonie and eight avocados and then it was able to distribute the seeds,

778
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:56,040
 but they haven't existed for 12,000 years and we don't know why avocados have managed to exist

779
00:38:56,040 --> 00:39:00,280
 without them because humans surely haven't been distributing avocados seeds in a systematic way

780
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:06,200
 for 12,000 years. It seems unlikely and yet they've stuck around. Can I just say something about

781
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:12,200
 brains? So when you sleep, your brain cells shrink to half their normal size. As you sleep,

782
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:16,680
 your brain cells literally get half as big as they are. To do a head shrink? Yeah, it's all the size.

783
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:20,840
 Is your brain literally 50 per size? Yes, it is. Have you never seen a sleeping person? It's like

784
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:28,440
 an old-sized body and then a doll's head. No, it's incredible. It's unbelievable. Is that why you

785
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:35,080
 yawn when you wake up because you're like re-inflating yourself? No, they found this out recently,

786
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:39,800
 they can shrink by up to 60 per cent while you sleep and they think this is because I think we've

787
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:45,000
 mentioned that they've recently discovered that the purpose of sleep they believe is to flush out

788
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:48,600
 all the waste from your brain. So it allows fluid to travel around your brain cells and in between

789
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:53,240
 them and kind of flush out all the useless stuff and that's why your brain uses the same amount of energy

790
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:57,480
 when you sleep as when you're awake because it's doing all this stuff and it's thought that by shrinking,

791
00:39:57,480 --> 00:40:01,960
 it creates more space around the cells so that the fluid can flush through them more easily and get

792
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:08,360
 rid of all the waste. That is amazing. Isn't it so cool? Yeah, that's amazing. If you get a

793
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:15,080
 bowl and you put it in a female bowl, this is and you put it in a cage with a male bowl and then

794
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:20,920
 you stimulate certain parts of its brain then the female bowl will fall in love with the male bowl.

795
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:27,560
 So which brain are you stimulating? The females. Really? Yep. Why would you do that? Is this some kind of

796
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:36,520
 Shakespearean comedy where they have a love potion? The taming of the bowl. No, this is just a

797
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:41,480
 study that was done in Atlanta and they got this bowl and they stimulated it and put it in with the

798
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:47,400
 male and then they put the female bowl in to another cage with both that male and another one and she

799
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:52,120
 always went to the one that she was hanging out with while she was being stimulated in the brain and

800
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:57,240
 then they did it with another bowl who hadn't had her brain stimulated and she would more often go

801
00:40:57,240 --> 00:41:02,120
 for the new guy. Oh really? It's got anything to do because the bowl is an anagram for love and if

802
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:09,320
 you're scrambling someone's brain up they're just like, "I'm a bowl, I'm in love." I didn't know we knew

803
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:13,960
 that bowls felt love. I'm excited. I think we might be extrapolating in the same way that I

804
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:20,600
 extrapolated that this was a brain in a seat. Don't believe anything you've heard over the last time.

805
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:30,280
 Okay, that's it. That's all of our thanks. Thank you so much for listening. If you want to
