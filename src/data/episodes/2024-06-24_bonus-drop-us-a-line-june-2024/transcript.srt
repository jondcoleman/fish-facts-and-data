00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,640
 [phone ringing]

2
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:10,600
 [music]

3
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:11,480
 Hi!

4
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:13,320
 Hi! Hello!

5
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:14,120
 Hello.

6
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:15,560
 Guy, in there ahead of you Andy.

7
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:16,960
 Yeah, well...

8
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:19,240
 Once it's been to the edit, which I don't actually do,

9
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:21,520
 I hope someone will have changed that.

10
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:23,560
 James has always gone first.

11
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:25,840
 Hi everybody, welcome to Drops of Line.

12
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:28,960
 Very long time no lines dropped.

13
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:30,000
 Right?

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,120
 We've got a lot of...

15
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:32,960
 There's a bulging post-bag to be gone through.

16
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:33,440
 Is there?

17
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:35,440
 Oh my goodness.

18
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:37,720
 I can see it in the corner of the room.

19
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:40,440
 There's letters just popping out of them.

20
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:44,520
 Huge. All of them from the British Institute of Graphology.

21
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:46,840
 Very cross of what we've said.

22
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:48,000
 I don't think we've said that yet.

23
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,440
 No, no, no, they will.

24
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:51,520
 Oh, dummy.

25
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:54,760
 Oh, the British Association of Sidekicks.

26
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:57,400
 We've written all sorts of letters.

27
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:00,960
 Oh, so let's get into our fabulous correspondence.

28
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,440
 First up, we mentioned Mexico recently.

29
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:04,280
 I don't know if you remember that.

30
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:05,360
 We said no one listened.

31
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:05,920
 Yes.

32
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:06,400
 Right.

33
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,320
 And I would like to...

34
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:08,320
 We said which...

35
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:10,120
 I said it was in North America.

36
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:10,720
 Yep.

37
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:13,960
 And we discussed whether it might be in Central or South America.

38
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:15,920
 But either way, it didn't matter because no one in Mexico listens.

39
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:18,920
 Well, I'd just like to apologise to and thank...

40
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:22,120
 Memo, Gerardo, Eilis, Gabriella, Gustavo, Cervantes,

41
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:25,840
 Humberto, Juan, Rafael, Giovanni, Emilio, Cynthia and Jonathan.

42
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:28,880
 Oh, so that wasn't one person.

43
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:31,160
 Also, Pilius Stipe, amazing name.

44
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:32,120
 Amazing name.

45
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:32,920
 Pilius.

46
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:33,600
 Pilius.

47
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:36,280
 Pilius Stipe, who's from Mexico, but Mexico in New York.

48
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:37,520
 Not Mexico, but Mexico.

49
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:38,640
 OK, we're not going to count it.

50
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,800
 But they all live in North America, that's the point.

51
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:45,200
 Giovanni Zacharia writes, "Mexico is in North America.

52
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,200
 "At least I hope so, given that it was part of NAFTA,

53
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,440
 "the North American Free Trade Agreement from 1994 to 2020."

54
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:51,040
 Fair point.

55
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:54,520
 NAFTA sounds like the razzies for the BAFTAs here.

56
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:56,520
 Yes!

57
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:00,400
 Oh, I hope a few people turn up, hoping that's it in NAFTA.

58
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:05,400
 And Ashley Hebert writes that they're not from Mexico,

59
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:07,840
 but they're from Belize, Mexico's southern neighbour.

60
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:10,280
 Well, that I believe is in Central America.

61
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:12,960
 OK, so we've crossed the border now to Central America.

62
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:13,800
 Very exciting.

63
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,600
 What's her point writing in from Belize?

64
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,200
 Or his, Ashley can be both.

65
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,640
 Or his point writing in from Belize.

66
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:21,360
 Ashley's point is simply they're from Belize.

67
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:24,040
 Let's do a gig in Belize City.

68
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:25,560
 That'd be amazing.

69
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,960
 So does anyone here have a question or a point?

70
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,720
 They just want to let us know they listen.

71
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:31,240
 Yeah, I think that's nice.

72
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:34,840
 And I think Belize possibly is the most unusual place

73
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,640
 that I've heard that we have listeners.

74
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:39,800
 If you think you're in the most unusual place in the world,

75
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,000
 we have listeners, please tell us.

76
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,560
 Are you in Guadalupe?

77
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,680
 Are you in the Central African Republic?

78
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,160
 Are you in Mauritania?

79
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:48,720
 They're way not writing.

80
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,880
 Definitely, do podcast.qr.com.

81
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:52,240
 The ISS, that's what we need.

82
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,960
 That's what my dad wrote a porno had.

83
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:57,400
 And they had an astronaut string up episodes.

84
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:02,600
 Here is a very long, long ago callback from Katie Cain,

85
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:05,760
 who's a genealogist from the Chickasaw Nation.

86
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,320
 I just joined Club Fish.

87
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:08,160
 Welcome, Katie.

88
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,600
 And I'm listening to the back catalog.

89
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:12,040
 In the September 2023 drop us a line.

90
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:14,520
 So we are going back a bit now.

91
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:16,920
 Yol, I'm from Oklahoma, all right.

92
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:19,840
 Speculate on who would be who on Frasier.

93
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,800
 And actually, I think she's come up with a better casting.

94
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:22,320
 Oh.

95
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:23,520
 Was I here in that one?

96
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,400
 Yeah.

97
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,400
 September 2023?

98
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,280
 Oh, maybe not.

99
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:26,600
 No.

100
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,320
 OK, well, we talked about who would be who on Frasier.

101
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:28,880
 OK.

102
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:31,160
 Oh, no, I'm so sad I missed this.

103
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:32,400
 I know. Anna's been watching recently.

104
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:32,800
 So--

105
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,040
 I think I was the sofa.

106
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:35,960
 Well, Katie's nail--

107
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:36,840
 I think Katie's nailed it.

108
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:38,400
 Clearly, Dan is Daphne.

109
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,560
 She's psychic, and she has all these crazy stories.

110
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:41,240
 Oh, OK.

111
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:43,160
 Yeah, well, I think that.

112
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:47,160
 Anna gives off more Lilith vibes than Roz.

113
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,360
 Wow.

114
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,360
 Ice queen.

115
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,600
 Oh, my goodness.

116
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:53,160
 An unethical, unemotional, bloodless--

117
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:54,040
 I'll take that, Lilith.

118
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:54,800
 --quite unsettling.

119
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,800
 She's a laugh in a non-laughy kind of way.

120
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,000
 I can't remember who that is.

121
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:58,800
 She's Frasier's ex-wife.

122
00:03:58,800 --> 00:03:59,720
 Frasier's ex-wife.

123
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:00,220
 OK.

124
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:00,720
 Lys.

125
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,200
 Maybe Neweath, you know her.

126
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,160
 Oh, she's brilliant.

127
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,320
 Yeah, she's amazing.

128
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:05,240
 She's not Marius.

129
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,560
 Oh, she listens to us, doesn't she?

130
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,840
 I think she might know who I am.

131
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:09,720
 Not sure if you listen to her.

132
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:11,080
 I don't think she's a club fish member.

133
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:13,240
 Right, if you are be me, though, amazing.

134
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:15,880
 Anyway, so James is Martin Crane.

135
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:16,960
 Andy is Niles.

136
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:18,040
 Dan is Daphne.

137
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:18,960
 Anna is Lilith.

138
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:21,280
 Alex Bell is Ross.

139
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:24,400
 And just to round it out, Jamie Morton is Frasier.

140
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,760
 From my dad, Rhonda Porno.

141
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:26,360
 What?

142
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,440
 He's the main character.

143
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,840
 I'm not sure if you think he's a bitch.

144
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:31,120
 I'm just going to gloss over how I'm

145
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:34,360
 the really old guy who can't watch Martin.

146
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,800
 You shouldn't have tried to stop that robbery

147
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,240
 and got yourself shot in the head.

148
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,520
 Who are you?

149
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:39,020
 Niles.

150
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:39,640
 You're Niles.

151
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:40,800
 Come on, Andy's obviously--

152
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,480
 the only reason that Andy's reading this

153
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:44,560
 is because he's Niles.

154
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:47,520
 But Jamie, I think everything was quite good.

155
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:48,640
 Questionable on James' one.

156
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:51,120
 But really, not sitting with Jamie.

157
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,080
 Martin likes drinking beer and watching sports.

158
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:53,600
 He does this.

159
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,080
 That's true.

160
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:56,440
 He's pretty-- he defines himself as working class,

161
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:59,800
 despite having a very comfortable life now.

162
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:03,360
 Hey, I didn't have Sky Sports growing up.

163
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,760
 How can I just say?

164
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:06,040
 Your cat drinks every end.

165
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:10,360
 So anyway, thank you, Katie.

166
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,960
 I think that's not a bad casting.

167
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:12,460
 Pretty good.

168
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:12,960
 Pretty good.

169
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:13,640
 I'm trying it.

170
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:17,240
 Can I just say all that the same but John Lai does Frasier?

171
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:19,440
 Pretty good.

172
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:22,040
 Here's a cool one from Z Rosewood.

173
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:24,040
 Stunning name.

174
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:26,680
 It's about being served fish and chips in a newspaper, right?

175
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:27,640
 Oh, yes.

176
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:28,920
 So we talked a bit about that.

177
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:29,680
 And this is amazing.

178
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,360
 I'm in the US, and quite frequently,

179
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,960
 have had fake newspaper lining the basket or tray

180
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,480
 when I've ordered fish and chips.

181
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,840
 Does this happen in the UK?

182
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:37,720
 Yeah, I've seen it.

183
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:39,240
 I've seen it, yeah.

184
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:41,360
 And it's only one side.

185
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:44,480
 It's like grease-proof paper, but it's got pretend.

186
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:46,200
 Just a print, like it's a one-pattern.

187
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,400
 It's a tribute, isn't it?

188
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,760
 And Z writes that it's like squiggly words and figures.

189
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,560
 So it's sort of not actual stuff.

190
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,640
 It'd be fun to get actual stories in there.

191
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:55,040
 Surely, if you're going to bother doing that,

192
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:57,200
 you've got to get someone at the chippy to write the stories.

193
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,960
 Other fish and chip shop down the road

194
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:02,960
 found to have rat infestation.

195
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:03,680
 OK, here's another one.

196
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:08,880
 Sean King writes, subject, who needs sheet music?

197
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,080
 Oh, my god.

198
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,440
 But no, the story has moved on.

199
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:13,640
 This is really good.

200
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:16,080
 Dan may like to know the classical music world is finally

201
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,880
 taking his criticism on board.

202
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:18,720
 Wow.

203
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,400
 This year's proms is set to feature

204
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:26,080
 a performance of Beethoven's "Night Symphony" from memory.

205
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:26,920
 So fun.

206
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:30,000
 Da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da.

207
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:30,920
 It's a fair fit.

208
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,800
 People are going to go nuts.

209
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:33,480
 Oh, no.

210
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:36,440
 Forgive me the night that I complied that joke.

211
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:37,520
 Ditton.

212
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:38,680
 Promp-pomp.

213
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:43,080
 Oh, yeah. It was-- it was better.

214
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:44,280
 James, this was better, actually,

215
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,280
 even though yours was right out.

216
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,200
 That's sorry.

217
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,920
 Anyway, yeah, no, the blurb says it's

218
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:51,320
 to mark the 200th anniversary with a signature

219
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:53,720
 memorized presentation and performance from the all-

220
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,080
 Imagine if they fuck it up.

221
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:56,600
 Oh, it's great.

222
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:59,440
 One person is going to do da, da, da, da, da, da, da.

223
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,080
 They're going to do it.

224
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:02,480
 They're all going to be lost.

225
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:04,320
 The conductor's going to be walking into walls.

226
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:07,320
 There's going to be the soon players toppling over.

227
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:10,080
 Pomp-pomp's Bruce Springsteen saved the day.

228
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,680
 [LAUGHTER]

229
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:14,400
 Oh, anyway.

230
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,360
 So, great.

231
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,040
 Exciting.

232
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,120
 Very exciting.

233
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,960
 Ellie Rose writes, pretty sure you don't actually

234
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:21,840
 want to know this, but Wendy's fries--

235
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,800
 so we were talking about-- what was it?

236
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,800
 Someone-- there was a murder case

237
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:28,480
 that was kind of half-solved by the fact

238
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:31,040
 that Wendy's fry was found during the autopsy, right?

239
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,960
 Yeah, that's absolutely correct, yes.

240
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,120
 And they're specific fries.

241
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,800
 And I think we said, oh, we can't tell--

242
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,760
 is there a difference between McDonald's and Wendy's,

243
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:39,720
 which there obviously will be.

244
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,520
 Exactly, and they looked at the nearby Wendy's

245
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:44,080
 and found one of the criminals had been to a Wendy's.

246
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,000
 It's like CCTV footage.

247
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:45,760
 Yeah, exactly.

248
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:47,920
 Well, Ellie Rose writes, pretty sure you don't actually

249
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,320
 want to know this, but Wendy's fries

250
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:50,960
 are one of the few fast food places

251
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:53,960
 that leave the skin on potatoes.

252
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:57,400
 Whereas Zachary Peters sends an alternative explanation,

253
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,760
 how did the forensic investigators

254
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:00,160
 know the fries were from Wendy's?

255
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,520
 Easy, they were cold.

256
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:04,520
 [LAUGHTER]

257
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:06,600
 That's superb.

258
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,440
 There you go.

259
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:08,720
 That's balance, you see?

260
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,520
 That's, you know, pro Wendy's and anti-Wendy's.

261
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:11,360
 Absolutely.

262
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:14,240
 Douglas Fudd writes, he's the professor

263
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,480
 at the Schmidt College of Science and Technology

264
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:18,400
 in Chapman University, California.

265
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:21,080
 This is not a comment about Anna's Lawrence of Elabia,

266
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:22,840
 Freudian slip.

267
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:25,080
 So I don't know why Douglas opens with that actually,

268
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:25,560
 but--

269
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,240
 [LAUGHTER]

270
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:30,000
 That's a dragon's bite there.

271
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,400
 Yeah, it has to do with a witty comment that James made

272
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:36,880
 when you were discussing Hitler's eagle's nest.

273
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:37,160
 Oh, yeah.

274
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:37,760
 Do you remember it?

275
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:38,680
 Ari and B&B.

276
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:41,640
 James made a joke about Ari and B&B, which was very funny.

277
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:42,080
 Thank you.

278
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:42,640
 And perhaps--

279
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:43,640
 Thank you, Professor Fudge.

280
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:45,040
 Yeah.

281
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:47,840
 And perhaps funnier than he realized.

282
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,040
 Oh, no, I knew it was good.

283
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,840
 [LAUGHTER]

284
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:55,200
 Well, an airy is another name for an eagle's nest.

285
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,120
 An airy, yeah.

286
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,360
 Which is-- many of your listeners

287
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,400
 will know because it is a common crossword word.

288
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:01,400
 I suppose it might have been intentional.

289
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:03,800
 And if so, it was an impressive double pun.

290
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,640
 If it wasn't, I just thought I'd point it out.

291
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:06,480
 Yeah, thanks.

292
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:09,680
 Yeah, I hadn't thought of that, although I do know what an airy is.

293
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,680
 So it's even funnier than you realized.

294
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:12,160
 Yeah.

295
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,200
 That's good.

296
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:13,840
 That's great.

297
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,240
 You're operating at a high level now.

298
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:15,840
 I am.

299
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,360
 Your side conscious is beyond you.

300
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:21,040
 The puns are so good that even I don't get them.

301
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,760
 This is a riddle from a listener now.

302
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:24,000
 Ooh, yes.

303
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:24,800
 Riddle, Connor.

304
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:25,920
 Riddle me this.

305
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:32,880
 Why is the lighthouse in the Azores on the island of Fayal

306
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:36,960
 abandoned as of the 1950s?

307
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:39,120
 OK.

308
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,280
 I feel like I might have heard this before.

309
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:43,560
 Fayal in the Azores is a lighthouse.

310
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:45,080
 OK, yeah.

311
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:47,440
 Abandoned since the '50s.

312
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,800
 What happened in the '50s?

313
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:51,000
 Nuclear testing.

314
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,760
 Something happened that meant this lighthouse

315
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:53,560
 was no longer useful.

316
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:55,120
 A historical event we might know about.

317
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,800
 Is this the one where someone went missing?

318
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:00,040
 It was like a murder case where suddenly

319
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:02,000
 the three people who were running the lighthouse

320
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,160
 just disappeared.

321
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:06,480
 And so it's sort of a cold case still.

322
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,000
 It's not that one, but that's very good.

323
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,800
 I like that, yeah.

324
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,680
 What makes a lighthouse useful?

325
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:14,840
 It can stop ships from crashing into the rocks.

326
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:17,240
 And what would stop a lighthouse from carrying out its function?

327
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:19,480
 A bulb, big enough to sit in that.

328
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:22,080
 If it was always daytime, you wouldn't need it.

329
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,120
 OK, yeah.

330
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,040
 Keep thinking.

331
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,360
 So water.

332
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,000
 Yeah.

333
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,560
 But what's important for the ships to be able to see?

334
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:29,280
 The rocks.

335
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:30,360
 The light from the lighthouse.

336
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,600
 Oh, the lighthouse, yeah.

337
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,080
 Not the rocks.

338
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:32,680
 The not the rocks.

339
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:33,720
 They can't see the rocks.

340
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,240
 No, that's why you've got to see the light.

341
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:37,520
 So the bulb is burnt out and they can't afford anyone.

342
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:39,240
 It's not the bulb burning out that stops

343
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:41,520
 this lighthouse being visible from the short.

344
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:44,480
 Oh, someone's built a wall in front of it.

345
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:47,360
 Someone's built a new high-rise apartment right next to it

346
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,720
 so you can't see it anymore.

347
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:49,440
 Shall I tell you?

348
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,800
 You're closer, James.

349
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,520
 It went into disuse because a mountain

350
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:56,640
 had sprang out of the ocean in front of it.

351
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:57,960
 That's amazing.

352
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:58,640
 That's brilliant.

353
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,520
 It's called the Vulcao dos Capelinios.

354
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:01,400
 And it was created.

355
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:03,400
 With this mountain by a volcanic eruption in the '50s.

356
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,200
 That's stunning.

357
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,200
 That is amazing.

358
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,520
 That's so good.

359
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:07,800
 That's incredible.

360
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:10,960
 If you want to hear us scrambling towards any other answers,

361
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:13,080
 you can listen to us on Tom Scott's podcast

362
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:13,760
 in a few weeks.

363
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:14,240
 Yeah.

364
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,600
 Which we're going to be on lateral.

365
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,440
 Lateral.

366
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:17,840
 We're going to be on the 100th episode.

367
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:18,440
 It's really fun.

368
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,080
 Very good fun.

369
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,320
 Yeah.

370
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,760
 Here's a thanks but no thanks.

371
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:24,200
 I don't know if you remember what this format point is.

372
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,720
 A suggestion is being made to the show.

373
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:26,320
 Yeah.

374
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,400
 We definitely won't do it.

375
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:28,320
 Thanks.

376
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:28,960
 No thanks.

377
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:32,800
 So Matt T writes, on a recent walkthrough sandwich in Kent,

378
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,200
 which is located near Ham, very good,

379
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,880
 my friend mentioned his dad saw a cow with a window

380
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:39,520
 in the side of its body.

381
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:40,360
 Cool.

382
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:42,040
 I've never seen one of those in real life.

383
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:43,040
 Wow.

384
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,440
 I can't remember why they've got windows.

385
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:46,480
 So you can see inside them.

386
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,280
 See how much milk is left.

387
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:50,960
 It's neither of those things.

388
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,200
 Like a slurpy machine.

389
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,440
 Normally, you have to shake the cow upside down a bit

390
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:57,400
 and say, oh, we need to go and get another cow.

391
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,880
 They have imperial on one side and then

392
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:01,640
 mention it on the other side, actually.

393
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:03,760
 They're born like that.

394
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:06,400
 Yes, so it's because-- so if you've got a sick cow,

395
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,160
 then you can replace its stomach contents

396
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,040
 with the stomach contents of a healthy cow,

397
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:13,840
 and it'll get the nice healthy bacteria in the microbiome.

398
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,920
 So to get the stuff out of the healthy cow,

399
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,520
 you cut a little hole in its stomach,

400
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:19,680
 so you can put your arm in when you need to take stuff out,

401
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:20,480
 put it in the other cow.

402
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,480
 It's a reusable window.

403
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:22,480
 It's a reusable window.

404
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:23,600
 You just open the window.

405
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,680
 Doesn't harm the cow.

406
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:27,000
 Probably embarrasses it a bit.

407
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,520
 So a slurpy cow with a window in it, cool.

408
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:29,520
 Yes, cool.

409
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:30,320
 And the mat goes on.

410
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,120
 However, the reason I wanted to email--

411
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:34,760
 a lot of curveballs.

412
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:38,240
 It's about Abbott's joke about Lawrence of Arabia.

413
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:40,520
 Anyway, the reason I wanted to email Matt says,

414
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:42,600
 is to suggest a new format for bonus material.

415
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:43,560
 Oh yeah, great.

416
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:45,400
 My work for a legal technology company

417
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:48,880
 that houses the world's laws, dating back to 1163.

418
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:51,560
 And I'm always fascinated by interesting facts about the law.

419
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:54,520
 Often, on fish, you have good law-related facts.

420
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:56,240
 So how about a new format where you focus

421
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,120
 on a single topic, such as the law,

422
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:00,720
 or golf, for James, yetis, for Dan, et cetera.

423
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:04,320
 Essentially, a topic deep dive.

424
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,280
 Not a bad suggestion.

425
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:05,960
 Yeah.

426
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:08,000
 Let's cut this but out in case we use it.

427
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,760
 We don't want to have to credit him.

428
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:12,560
 I mean, essentially, we do that four times in every show,

429
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,440
 don't we, deep dive, subject.

430
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:16,040
 So who's going to say the phrase?

431
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:18,000
 Thanks, but no thanks.

432
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,640
 There we go.

433
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:20,560
 No, it's a nice idea.

434
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:21,400
 It is a nice idea.

435
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,000
 No, really, thanks.

436
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,960
 And also, it sounds like you've got loads of great law facts.

437
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:27,560
 You send us good nuggets of original laws.

438
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:28,600
 Here's one.

439
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:29,600
 This is a good one.

440
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,680
 From Chris Rowe, we talked about selling time, remember that?

441
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:33,680
 Yeah.

442
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:36,280
 And the barter system on another recent episode.

443
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:37,520
 So this is great.

444
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:39,160
 I used to live in Glastonbury, says Chris,

445
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:42,560
 and was part of the Let's scheme, Local Exchange and Trading,

446
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,960
 where people traded time.

447
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:46,720
 The service you offered, like gardening,

448
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,240
 would be listed in a directory.

449
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,440
 Anyone in the scheme can request some gardening time,

450
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:51,880
 if that's what you're offering.

451
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:55,080
 And they would pay you a fixed amount per hour of credit,

452
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:57,280
 and you would use your credits to buy another service

453
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:58,240
 from this directory, right?

454
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,280
 Yeah, that's cool.

455
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:01,960
 If anyone left the scheme, the only thing lost was time.

456
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,280
 It was all very altruistic.

457
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:05,080
 However, it all fell apart for us

458
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:07,160
 when some individuals said an hour of their time

459
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:09,560
 was worth more because they were a piano teacher,

460
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:11,120
 whereas you were a cleaner.

461
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,720
 Well, actually, that's really interesting,

462
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:16,760
 because I think we said when we discussed these utopian societies

463
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:19,760
 that that is a problem that they constantly came up against.

464
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,280
 It's like whose time is worth the most.

465
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:23,600
 If you are able to build houses,

466
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:26,040
 then maybe your time is more useful

467
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:27,720
 than someone who makes podcasts.

468
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:29,000
 Well, relevant.

469
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,840
 Chris finishes with, "This was a moot point in any case,

470
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:34,080
 "as, being Glastonbury, there were 17 people

471
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:35,360
 "offering to massage your aura,

472
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,200
 "and only one that could unblock your loo."

473
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:39,440
 (laughing)

474
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:45,760
 I think I said that I have a time bank in my village as well.

475
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:46,760
 Yeah, that's right.

476
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:49,400
 But it also doesn't work that well,

477
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:53,040
 because loads of people want to offer their time,

478
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:55,640
 but people don't really need stuff.

479
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:57,480
 So they end up just having cake sales

480
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:58,520
 where they give cakes to each other.

481
00:14:58,520 --> 00:14:59,920
 Have you offered your time?

482
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,440
 No, no, I haven't. I would. I should.

483
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,920
 What skills do you have, though?

484
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:04,720
 You can't unblock a toilet, I reckon.

485
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,440
 Just give them a one-man podcast.

486
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:07,760
 One-woman podcast.

487
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,840
 (laughing)

488
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:11,360
 In exchange for doing my garden.

489
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,600
 (laughing)

490
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:16,440
 Here's Alan Williams.

491
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,960
 What was said about the tuber part in Dvorak's,

492
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:20,920
 is it Dvorak?

493
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,040
 Dvorak. Dvorak, yeah.

494
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:23,640
 What was said about the tuber part

495
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:26,560
 in Dvorak's New World Symphony is Bollocks.

496
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:27,880
 Oh, how interesting.

497
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:28,720
 Okay, go on.

498
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,000
 But I think we said that it,

499
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,160
 did we say that it was a-

500
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:32,560
 I think we said it was a story.

501
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,680
 Yeah, it depends what he's saying, it's Bollocks.

502
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:35,520
 So we would say-

503
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:36,960
 It's not Bollocks from the Hovis adverts,

504
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:38,440
 that's not Bollocks.

505
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:39,920
 We said that there were seven tuber nights

506
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:41,600
 at the beginning and seven at the end,

507
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:42,960
 and it was because-

508
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,920
 There was a rumour it was because

509
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:47,520
 he wanted to keep the tuba player in the orchestra

510
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:48,600
 so that he didn't shag his wife.

511
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:49,840
 'Cause the tuba player had been falling in love

512
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:51,000
 with Dvorak's wife?

513
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:51,840
 Yeah, but that was real.

514
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:54,360
 Was he in love shagging, it was, yeah.

515
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:56,160
 Well, Alan disagrees strongly.

516
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,720
 He says, "I was at a concert in Bramford

517
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:59,720
 with the Hala conducted by Sir Mark Elder,

518
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:01,600
 and he highlighted the fact that the tuber part

519
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:04,520
 was just 40 notes at the beginning of the slow movement,

520
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:06,920
 not two separate sequences of seven notes,

521
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:09,040
 and he had the orchestra play the relevant section with

522
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:12,260
 and without the tuber before performing the entire symphony.

523
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:14,320
 This showed conclusively that these 40 notes

524
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,960
 contributed significantly to the overall sound

525
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:19,640
 and were very far from being superfluous.

526
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:20,480
 Look, that's fair enough.

527
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,600
 Sounds like it's a matter of opinion.

528
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:25,080
 And, let's see a tuber player this guy,

529
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:26,240
 'cause they are quite touchy.

530
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:30,160
 He doesn't specify, there's a wrong tuber vibe

531
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:31,000
 coming off of it.

532
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,480
 But apparently Dvorak did a great favour to tuber players

533
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:36,640
 'cause their rate of pay was usually dependent

534
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:40,280
 on performances and sessions where they're required at.

535
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:42,480
 So you get paid, yeah, they don't just get paid per note.

536
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:43,600
 That'd be really weird to get,

537
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,840
 but how do you still get paid in a piece?

538
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:49,040
 - They don't get paid according to the time they spend playing.

539
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:51,560
 The tuber part as a bonus is also extremely easy,

540
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:54,240
 being very slow and merely wandering up and down scales.

541
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,080
 It is kerching for the tuber player.

542
00:16:56,080 --> 00:17:00,160
 - I think I'd rather have to play most of it

543
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:02,560
 than have to sit there silently getting a sore ass

544
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:06,000
 listening to my up themselves violinist colleagues.

545
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,560
 - It is quite dull to sit there

546
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:09,400
 when you're not playing in an orchestra for sure.

547
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,040
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

548
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:13,680
 Here is Kira Johnston from Scotland.

549
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:14,520
 - Mm-hmm.

550
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:16,600
 - I am writing from the break room in the hospital

551
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:18,040
 where I work as a junior doctor,

552
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:19,360
 where I'm currently catching a break

553
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:21,040
 towards the end of a 12 hour night shift

554
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,960
 and listening to episode 529.

555
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:27,440
 - Yeah, did you hear that UK government 12 hour shift?

556
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:29,840
 - Yeah, and also she's punishing herself

557
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:32,200
 by listening to our podcast, I mean.

558
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:34,280
 - I don't feel like you can really take it in

559
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:35,840
 after that kind of session.

560
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,600
 Get a good night's sleep, listen in the morning.

561
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,720
 - Well, she says, "I thought you might be interested to know

562
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:42,680
 that I'm not only carrying two pages or bleeps,

563
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:44,680
 as we call them, but also a walkie-talkie."

564
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:45,520
 - Oh, great.

565
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:47,120
 - Really, a walkie-talkie?

566
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:49,880
 - We've had a few emails from the pager community.

567
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:52,160
 Bleeps pages are very useful

568
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:56,040
 'cause they work without signal and everyone knows where to go.

569
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:58,840
 Did we get any emails from anyone in the bleeper community

570
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:03,560
 who is not a doctor or a nurse or, I don't remember.

571
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:05,280
 - I think it's used by birdwatchers as well.

572
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:06,120
 - How's it?

573
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:08,840
 - I think there's a, yes, I think when they get a good Twitch,

574
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:10,280
 they put a page out.

575
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:11,120
 - Oh, that's nice.

576
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:11,960
 - Something like that, I'm pretty sure.

577
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:15,640
 - The networks are not there of sort of like UK Twitchers

578
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:18,760
 or birdwatchers, sorry, they don't like the word Twitchers.

579
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:20,120
 - These are the Twitchers 'cause they're just,

580
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:23,760
 the bleepers tell you where the hot shit bird is.

581
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,360
 So I think that's true, isn't it?

582
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:27,000
 Please write in birdwatchers, isn't it?

583
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,560
 Twitchers are people who just get excited

584
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:30,640
 about an exotic bird that turns up on our--

585
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:31,760
 - They complete the lists.

586
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,240
 Twitchers just want to complete the lists.

587
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:36,080
 Birdwatchers want to understand the feathered friends.

588
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,720
 - I see, yes, yeah.

589
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:40,240
 - The most complete is.

590
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:41,440
 - Here's Paul Rosenthal.

591
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:42,280
 - Yep.

592
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:43,120
 - I just listened to--

593
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,400
 - There's a lot of roses in this, in bars.

594
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,800
 - Oh yeah, we had Z Rosewood, Paul Rosenthal, good spot.

595
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:48,560
 - And then another one who was called Rose.

596
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:49,920
 - Do we?

597
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:50,920
 - Chris Rowe.

598
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:53,160
 - Do you alphabetize all of these emails?

599
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:54,000
 - Of course.

600
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:54,840
 - R, R-O.

601
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:57,520
 - I listened to your recent episode

602
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,040
 describing American dry states

603
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:00,920
 banning alcohol sales at 30,000 feet.

604
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:01,760
 - Oh yes.

605
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,680
 - I wanted to share a similar story at ground level.

606
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:06,000
 I grew up in California for my freshman year of college

607
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:10,120
 in 1973, traveled alone by train to New York.

608
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:13,600
 On the second day of the uncomfortable three day journey,

609
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,600
 old timers began walking up and down the train

610
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:18,960
 announcing two hours to Kansas, then one hour to Kansas,

611
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:21,920
 and ultimately 15 minutes to Kansas.

612
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:24,080
 Kansas then banned the sale of alcohol,

613
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,760
 but not the consumption.

614
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,760
 So the bar had to close for as long as the train

615
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:30,440
 was passing through Kansas.

616
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:32,360
 But if you'd bought something, you could still drink it.

617
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:34,880
 - That is a bit like on UK trains where they say,

618
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,720
 "We're about to arrive in Carlisle

619
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:39,280
 "when the train staff will change over,

620
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:41,200
 "so you will not be able to buy the alcohol

621
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,600
 "for the next 20 minutes."

622
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:43,600
 (laughing)

623
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:46,200
 And everyone in the carriage just furtively stands up

624
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:48,920
 and shuffles down the character.

625
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:51,240
 - And he says it was mid-afternoon when this happened,

626
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:53,120
 but people rushed to the bar in panic

627
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:54,560
 and started snapping up beer.

628
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:56,480
 It didn't take long before the entire Amtrak train

629
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:57,720
 was plastered.

630
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:59,160
 Someone decided it would be appropriate

631
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:01,240
 to hurl the empty beer bottles out of the window

632
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:02,720
 into Kansas.

633
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,320
 The windows were all sealed,

634
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:05,840
 but that didn't stop pickled passengers

635
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,160
 from clawing at the windows.

636
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:08,000
 - Wow.

637
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:08,840
 - That was terrifying.

638
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:09,680
 - Yeah, that doesn't sound great.

639
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:11,160
 - Pretty frightening story, yeah.

640
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:12,640
 - But it does mean, presumably the announcement,

641
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,400
 "We're not in Kansas anymore."

642
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,640
 Had a very different tone on that train.

643
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,160
 (laughing)

644
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:20,000
 Yay!

645
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:20,840
 - Oh, brilliant.

646
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:22,200
 - That's so good.

647
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,120
 - Ed Robinson.

648
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:24,600
 - So it's another R.O.

649
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:28,040
 - Yeah, I think Kandy's alphabetized all of the--

650
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:28,880
 - It must be.

651
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:29,720
 - Correspondence.

652
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:30,800
 - Imagine if your inbox is in alphabetical order

653
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:32,200
 rather than order of arrival.

654
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:33,520
 - Yeah, what's wrong with that?

655
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:35,760
 (laughing)

656
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:40,400
 - So Ed Robinson writes, "In 2017 I was very interested

657
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,320
 to hear in the latest episode that the Tin Opener

658
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:45,520
 was invented several years after the invention of the tin."

659
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:47,920
 I think we said some decades, didn't we?

660
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:49,440
 This was a particular note to me,

661
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,160
 as for most of my adult life,

662
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:53,840
 I've been telling people as a bit of after-dinner trivia

663
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:56,960
 that the tin was invented several years

664
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:59,480
 after the invention of the tin opener.

665
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:03,360
 I've never quite been able to explain to people why

666
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:04,760
 they would have done that.

667
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:05,600
 - I love that.

668
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,040
 (laughing)

669
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:08,200
 - So close.

670
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:10,840
 - Just a classic half-remembering of a fact.

671
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:13,760
 (laughing)

672
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:15,120
 - It would be a better fact.

673
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:16,480
 It would be an even more amazing fact.

674
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:17,920
 - Of his stunning fact.

675
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:19,160
 (laughing)

676
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:20,920
 - The psychics again.

677
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:23,520
 - Oh dear, love it.

678
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:26,840
 Here's a Danish correspondent called Søren.

679
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:27,680
 - Søren.

680
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,640
 - Which is an anagram of Rose N.

681
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:31,520
 (laughing)

682
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,360
 - Wow.

683
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:34,120
 - Something is going on.

684
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:38,160
 - Søren B, a maritime pilot from Denmark.

685
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:39,480
 Pretty cool.

686
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:41,040
 - Okay.

687
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:42,480
 - I've just listened to episode 42.

688
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:45,120
 - Who does like aircraft carrier?

689
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,760
 - No, I think that means that you,

690
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:48,320
 so certain large ships,

691
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:50,480
 when they're going out of a harbor,

692
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:53,320
 they need a specific driver pilot to come in

693
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:54,320
 and take them out.

694
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:55,320
 - Sorry, of course.

695
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:57,160
 - I think it's in there. - Yes, the harbor pilot.

696
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:59,240
 - I also thought the pilot was sometimes just a word

697
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:02,240
 to use for a person who captains a ship.

698
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,080
 - Yeah.

699
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:05,720
 - And I think it's that sort of very fine tune detail,

700
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:06,840
 isn't it?

701
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:10,600
 Episode 42.8, so Søren is a bit behind the curve.

702
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:12,040
 You talk about squatting of ships

703
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:13,760
 and how a cruise liner has to increase speed

704
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,880
 to safely pass under the Great Belt Bridge.

705
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:17,200
 - Oh yeah, that was a long time ago.

706
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,520
 - Yeah, yeah.

707
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:21,640
 - And Søren sails under the Great Belt Bridge almost daily.

708
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:22,480
 - Really?

709
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:23,320
 - It's just a cool thing.

710
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:24,360
 - And he never knew this fact

711
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:26,040
 and he's crashed into it every time.

712
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:28,040
 (laughing)

713
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:31,040
 - Is that the bridge between Copenhagen and Malmo,

714
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:31,880
 that one?

715
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:36,880
 - Between Ceyland and Sprogo, so don't know.

716
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:39,600
 - Well, tack to Søren.

717
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,040
 - Yeah, yeah, thank you, Søren.

718
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:43,640
 - That's really cool though, that he drives that ship.

719
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:47,160
 - Well, from sailing to dairy farms,

720
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:49,880
 Clement de Menizes, right?

721
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:51,080
 I've just listened to one of your wonderful

722
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:53,800
 compilations on Club Fish, that's nice.

723
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:56,760
 In it, Anna says that cows cannot lift one foot at a time.

724
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:59,520
 I'm headheads, we're not on a dairy farm.

725
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:00,360
 (laughing)

726
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:04,240
 They've just been kicked in the bollocks by a cow.

727
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:06,800
 That's so, I don't remember you ever saying that.

728
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:09,160
 It's like, you're so unlikely, I would say that,

729
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:11,160
 'cause it feels unlikely to be true.

730
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:14,840
 - How would they walk anywhere if they can't lift one foot?

731
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:16,520
 - They just slide everywhere.

732
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:17,880
 - You do the two-legged, yeah.

733
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:18,720
 - Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

734
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,240
 - Yeah, that's fine, it's still.

735
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:21,080
 - Even so.

736
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:22,160
 - Who do you say that?

737
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:23,200
 - I don't recall that.

738
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,040
 - Whoa.

739
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:26,320
 - I mean, the reason for the compilations are,

740
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:29,080
 the reason we have that material is either it's not true

741
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:31,560
 or it doesn't fit in the podcast.

742
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:33,440
 - I think the compilations are all true.

743
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:35,840
 I don't think we should advertise that they're--

744
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:36,680
 - No, there's some times--

745
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:37,920
 - I don't know if they're right.

746
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:39,720
 - Sometimes if we don't get things quite right,

747
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:41,660
 but it's still funny, then I'll go with it.

748
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:43,040
 - There's a slightly lower barrier,

749
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:43,880
 isn't there, to entry?

750
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:44,720
 - Yeah.

751
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,480
 - Great, a barrier that a cow couldn't get over,

752
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:49,040
 for instance, if one of them lifted any of its feet.

753
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:52,520
 - Clemens says, the reason you tip a cow,

754
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:54,080
 I mean, you were talking about cow tipping, maybe?

755
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:54,920
 - Okay.

756
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:55,920
 - It's because it's much easier to put a shoe on

757
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:57,560
 when they're on their side.

758
00:23:57,560 --> 00:24:00,600
 We still put shoes on cows to help with several foot problems.

759
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:04,800
 And you can get special crushes that tip the cow over

760
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:06,560
 to make hoof trimming easier.

761
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:07,400
 - Okay.

762
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:08,240
 - Okay.

763
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,080
 So thank you, Clement.

764
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:11,320
 - That's cool, okay, I do vaguely remember now

765
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:14,160
 thinking about getting one foot of a cow up.

766
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:15,240
 - Steve Bullock.

767
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:16,080
 That's weird.

768
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:20,000
 - I'm stuck here.

769
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,200
 Can't move my feet.

770
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:26,400
 - Stephen Bullock says, nestled in the latest episode,

771
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:29,200
 among the talk of muffs, muff diving and muff warmers,

772
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,760
 it was mentioned that on grand tours,

773
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:34,120
 pigs would be employed to pre-warm beds for the taurers.

774
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:35,400
 - Oh, okay, yeah.

775
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:37,440
 - My now departed dad, who fancied himself

776
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:40,880
 as entrepreneurially minded and grew up in poor circumstances,

777
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:43,000
 always claimed with some pride that his first job

778
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:46,680
 was as a child in the forties as a professional bed warmer

779
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:48,360
 for his older brother and sister,

780
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:50,120
 for which he was paid a hip in a week.

781
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:51,440
 - Aw, that's nice.

782
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:53,280
 - Were he still here, I'd have enjoyed pointing out

783
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:55,160
 that he missed a trick by not subcontracting

784
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,800
 to a pig or other animal.

785
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:58,840
 The great irony though, is that he was known

786
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:00,440
 as something of a womanizer,

787
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:05,040
 and so went on to warm many a bed that was not his own

788
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:06,760
 throughout his life.

789
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:07,600
 - This is terrible.

790
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:08,920
 - This has turned a corner, hasn't it?

791
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:10,040
 This little eunuchy.

792
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:12,880
 Good on in.

793
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,920
 - There you go, thank you, Stephen.

794
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:17,800
 - Got that practice of bed warming in early.

795
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:19,040
 - That's ridiculous.

796
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:23,040
 - Here's quite a niche one.

797
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:26,560
 Pamela, Pamela Cowey?

798
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:30,000
 Sorry, no, Pamela Cowey.

799
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,360
 - Oh, my God.

800
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:33,200
 - Dairy farmer, Bullock and Cowey.

801
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:35,840
 - This is starting to blow a bit open.

802
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:37,760
 - Whoa, yeah, yeah.

803
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:39,480
 Nitrogen, the Haber process,

804
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:41,480
 Haber, Billingham and Ammonia.

805
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:44,400
 Billingham has two local non-league football teams,

806
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,080
 Northern League Div 2.

807
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:47,480
 One is called Billingham Town,

808
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:49,960
 the other is called Billingham Synthonia.

809
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:51,080
 Do you remember Billingham is where they have

810
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:51,920
 that

811
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:53,680
 - Yeah, and it's just closed down, I think.

812
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:54,520
 - Right.

813
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:55,360
 - Yeah.

814
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:56,200
 - That makes all the nitrogen.

815
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:57,040
 - Yeah.

816
00:25:57,040 --> 00:26:00,600
 - Synthonia is a contraction of synthetic ammonia.

817
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:01,440
 - Wow.

818
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:02,280
 - That's awesome.

819
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:03,800
 - The product made by ICI in Billingham

820
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:05,720
 and with whom the club was associated.

821
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:07,600
 Unable to afford the ground upgrading,

822
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,280
 BS, Billingham Synthonia,

823
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:11,680
 now play some 50 miles away in Stokesley.

824
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:13,640
 - How ironic that they're named after something

825
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:16,080
 used for fertile and fertilizing land

826
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:17,960
 and they can't afford to upgrade their own.

827
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:18,800
 - Brilliant.

828
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:21,080
 And what lives on ground that you might fertilize?

829
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:21,920
 - Cow's.

830
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:23,280
 - Pamela Cowie.

831
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:26,400
 - And once the cow creates its dung,

832
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:27,720
 what can you first slice with that?

833
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:29,040
 Roses.

834
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:30,200
 - Yeah!

835
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:31,640
 - Something weird has happened today.

836
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:32,480
 - It's full circle.

837
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:33,600
 - We've turned a corner.

838
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,600
 - Yeah.

839
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:35,440
 Bye.

840
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:38,020
 (upbeat music)

841
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:40,800
 Bye, everybody.

842
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:42,040
 Bye, bye.

843
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:43,480
 Goodbye.

844
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:45,840
 Please email a podcast at qi.com.

845
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:47,120
 If you want to contribute.

846
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:47,960
 - Yeah.

847
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:48,800
 - And why wouldn't you?

848
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:49,640
 - Why wouldn't you?

849
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:51,240
 - If your name ends with S,

850
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:53,920
 because Andy will be hitting that bit of the alphabet

851
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:55,800
 for next week's episode.

852
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:57,120
 - Ends with S.

853
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:58,080
 - Starts with S.

854
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:59,080
 - Starts with S.

855
00:26:59,080 --> 00:26:59,920
 - I say ends with S.

856
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:01,080
 - Yeah, you did it as odd, wasn't it?

857
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:01,920
 - That's exciting.

858
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:02,760
 - Yeah.

859
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:03,600
 It's just coming at it from the other way.

860
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:05,240
 - That's a good challenge, yeah.

861
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:06,080
 - Is that a thanks note?

862
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:06,920
 Yeah, thank you, everybody.

863
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:08,360
 And thank you to the three of you.

864
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:09,200
 - Got it.

865
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:10,920
 (laughs)

866
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:11,760
 - That's nice.

867
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:13,040
 - It's great fun.

868
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:15,120
 Oh, and to you, Andy, for doing all the hard work

869
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:17,720
 and finding the emails and putting it together.

870
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:18,560
 - Nothing.

871
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:19,920
 - I do it for the love.

872
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:21,080
 - Ah, okay, well then I retract.

873
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:23,200
 (laughs)

874
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:24,040
 - Bye.

875
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:26,620
 (upbeat music)

876
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:29,200
 (upbeat music)

877
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:31,780
 (upbeat music)
