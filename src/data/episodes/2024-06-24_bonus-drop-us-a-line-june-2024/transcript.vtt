 [phone ringing]

00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:10.600
 [music]

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:11.480
 Hi!

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:13.320
 Hi! Hello!

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:14.120
 Hello.

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:15.560
 Guy, in there ahead of you Andy.

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:16.960
 Yeah, well...

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:19.240
 Once it's been to the edit, which I don't actually do,

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:21.520
 I hope someone will have changed that.

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:23.560
 James has always gone first.

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:25.840
 Hi everybody, welcome to Drops of Line.

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:28.960
 Very long time no lines dropped.

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:30.000
 Right?

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.120
 We've got a lot of...

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:32.960
 There's a bulging post-bag to be gone through.

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:33.440
 Is there?

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:35.440
 Oh my goodness.

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:37.720
 I can see it in the corner of the room.

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:40.440
 There's letters just popping out of them.

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.520
 Huge. All of them from the British Institute of Graphology.

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.840
 Very cross of what we've said.

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:48.000
 I don't think we've said that yet.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.440
 No, no, no, they will.

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:51.520
 Oh, dummy.

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:54.760
 Oh, the British Association of Sidekicks.

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:57.400
 We've written all sorts of letters.

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:00.960
 Oh, so let's get into our fabulous correspondence.

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.440
 First up, we mentioned Mexico recently.

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:04.280
 I don't know if you remember that.

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:05.360
 We said no one listened.

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:05.920
 Yes.

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:06.400
 Right.

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:07.320
 And I would like to...

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:08.320
 We said which...

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:10.120
 I said it was in North America.

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:10.720
 Yep.

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:13.960
 And we discussed whether it might be in Central or South America.

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:15.920
 But either way, it didn't matter because no one in Mexico listens.

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:18.920
 Well, I'd just like to apologise to and thank...

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:22.120
 Memo, Gerardo, Eilis, Gabriella, Gustavo, Cervantes,

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:25.840
 Humberto, Juan, Rafael, Giovanni, Emilio, Cynthia and Jonathan.

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:28.880
 Oh, so that wasn't one person.

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:31.160
 Also, Pilius Stipe, amazing name.

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:32.120
 Amazing name.

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.920
 Pilius.

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:33.600
 Pilius.

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.280
 Pilius Stipe, who's from Mexico, but Mexico in New York.

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:37.520
 Not Mexico, but Mexico.

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:38.640
 OK, we're not going to count it.

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.800
 But they all live in North America, that's the point.

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:45.200
 Giovanni Zacharia writes, "Mexico is in North America.

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.200
 "At least I hope so, given that it was part of NAFTA,

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:50.440
 "the North American Free Trade Agreement from 1994 to 2020."

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:51.040
 Fair point.

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:54.520
 NAFTA sounds like the razzies for the BAFTAs here.

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:56.520
 Yes!

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.400
 Oh, I hope a few people turn up, hoping that's it in NAFTA.

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:05.400
 And Ashley Hebert writes that they're not from Mexico,

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:07.840
 but they're from Belize, Mexico's southern neighbour.

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:10.280
 Well, that I believe is in Central America.

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:12.960
 OK, so we've crossed the border now to Central America.

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:13.800
 Very exciting.

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.600
 What's her point writing in from Belize?

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.200
 Or his, Ashley can be both.

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:18.640
 Or his point writing in from Belize.

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:21.360
 Ashley's point is simply they're from Belize.

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.040
 Let's do a gig in Belize City.

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:25.560
 That'd be amazing.

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.960
 So does anyone here have a question or a point?

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:29.720
 They just want to let us know they listen.

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:31.240
 Yeah, I think that's nice.

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:34.840
 And I think Belize possibly is the most unusual place

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:36.640
 that I've heard that we have listeners.

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:39.800
 If you think you're in the most unusual place in the world,

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:41.000
 we have listeners, please tell us.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.560
 Are you in Guadalupe?

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:45.680
 Are you in the Central African Republic?

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:47.160
 Are you in Mauritania?

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:48.720
 They're way not writing.

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:50.880
 Definitely, do podcast.qr.com.

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:52.240
 The ISS, that's what we need.

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:53.960
 That's what my dad wrote a porno had.

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:57.400
 And they had an astronaut string up episodes.

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:02.600
 Here is a very long, long ago callback from Katie Cain,

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:05.760
 who's a genealogist from the Chickasaw Nation.

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:07.320
 I just joined Club Fish.

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:08.160
 Welcome, Katie.

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:09.600
 And I'm listening to the back catalog.

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:12.040
 In the September 2023 drop us a line.

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:14.520
 So we are going back a bit now.

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:16.920
 Yol, I'm from Oklahoma, all right.

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:19.840
 Speculate on who would be who on Frasier.

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:21.800
 And actually, I think she's come up with a better casting.

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:22.320
 Oh.

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:23.520
 Was I here in that one?

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:24.400
 Yeah.

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:25.400
 September 2023?

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:26.280
 Oh, maybe not.

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:26.600
 No.

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:28.320
 OK, well, we talked about who would be who on Frasier.

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:28.880
 OK.

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:31.160
 Oh, no, I'm so sad I missed this.

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:32.400
 I know. Anna's been watching recently.

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:32.800
 So--

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:34.040
 I think I was the sofa.

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:35.960
 Well, Katie's nail--

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:36.840
 I think Katie's nailed it.

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:38.400
 Clearly, Dan is Daphne.

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:40.560
 She's psychic, and she has all these crazy stories.

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:41.240
 Oh, OK.

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:43.160
 Yeah, well, I think that.

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:47.160
 Anna gives off more Lilith vibes than Roz.

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:48.360
 Wow.

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:49.360
 Ice queen.

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:50.600
 Oh, my goodness.

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:53.160
 An unethical, unemotional, bloodless--

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:54.040
 I'll take that, Lilith.

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:54.800
 --quite unsettling.

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:56.800
 She's a laugh in a non-laughy kind of way.

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:58.000
 I can't remember who that is.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:58.800
 She's Frasier's ex-wife.

00:03:58.800 --> 00:03:59.720
 Frasier's ex-wife.

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:00.220
 OK.

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:00.720
 Lys.

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:02.200
 Maybe Neweath, you know her.

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:03.160
 Oh, she's brilliant.

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:04.320
 Yeah, she's amazing.

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:05.240
 She's not Marius.

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:06.560
 Oh, she listens to us, doesn't she?

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:08.840
 I think she might know who I am.

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:09.720
 Not sure if you listen to her.

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:11.080
 I don't think she's a club fish member.

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:13.240
 Right, if you are be me, though, amazing.

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:15.880
 Anyway, so James is Martin Crane.

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:16.960
 Andy is Niles.

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:18.040
 Dan is Daphne.

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:18.960
 Anna is Lilith.

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:21.280
 Alex Bell is Ross.

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:24.400
 And just to round it out, Jamie Morton is Frasier.

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:25.760
 From my dad, Rhonda Porno.

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:26.360
 What?

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:27.440
 He's the main character.

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:28.840
 I'm not sure if you think he's a bitch.

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:31.120
 I'm just going to gloss over how I'm

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:34.360
 the really old guy who can't watch Martin.

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:35.800
 You shouldn't have tried to stop that robbery

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:37.240
 and got yourself shot in the head.

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:38.520
 Who are you?

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:39.020
 Niles.

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:39.640
 You're Niles.

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:40.800
 Come on, Andy's obviously--

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:42.480
 the only reason that Andy's reading this

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:44.560
 is because he's Niles.

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:47.520
 But Jamie, I think everything was quite good.

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:48.640
 Questionable on James' one.

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:51.120
 But really, not sitting with Jamie.

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:53.080
 Martin likes drinking beer and watching sports.

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:53.600
 He does this.

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:54.080
 That's true.

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:56.440
 He's pretty-- he defines himself as working class,

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:59.800
 despite having a very comfortable life now.

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:03.360
 Hey, I didn't have Sky Sports growing up.

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:04.760
 How can I just say?

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:06.040
 Your cat drinks every end.

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:10.360
 So anyway, thank you, Katie.

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:11.960
 I think that's not a bad casting.

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:12.460
 Pretty good.

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:12.960
 Pretty good.

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:13.640
 I'm trying it.

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:17.240
 Can I just say all that the same but John Lai does Frasier?

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:19.440
 Pretty good.

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:22.040
 Here's a cool one from Z Rosewood.

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:24.040
 Stunning name.

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:26.680
 It's about being served fish and chips in a newspaper, right?

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:27.640
 Oh, yes.

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:28.920
 So we talked a bit about that.

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:29.680
 And this is amazing.

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:31.360
 I'm in the US, and quite frequently,

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:33.960
 have had fake newspaper lining the basket or tray

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:35.480
 when I've ordered fish and chips.

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:36.840
 Does this happen in the UK?

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:37.720
 Yeah, I've seen it.

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:39.240
 I've seen it, yeah.

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:41.360
 And it's only one side.

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:44.480
 It's like grease-proof paper, but it's got pretend.

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:46.200
 Just a print, like it's a one-pattern.

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:47.400
 It's a tribute, isn't it?

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:49.760
 And Z writes that it's like squiggly words and figures.

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:51.560
 So it's sort of not actual stuff.

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:53.640
 It'd be fun to get actual stories in there.

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:55.040
 Surely, if you're going to bother doing that,

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:57.200
 you've got to get someone at the chippy to write the stories.

00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:58.960
 Other fish and chip shop down the road

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:02.960
 found to have rat infestation.

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:03.680
 OK, here's another one.

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:08.880
 Sean King writes, subject, who needs sheet music?

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:10.080
 Oh, my god.

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:12.440
 But no, the story has moved on.

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:13.640
 This is really good.

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:16.080
 Dan may like to know the classical music world is finally

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:17.880
 taking his criticism on board.

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:18.720
 Wow.

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:21.400
 This year's proms is set to feature

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:26.080
 a performance of Beethoven's "Night Symphony" from memory.

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:26.920
 So fun.

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:30.000
 Da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:30.920
 It's a fair fit.

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:32.800
 People are going to go nuts.

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:33.480
 Oh, no.

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:36.440
 Forgive me the night that I complied that joke.

00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:37.520
 Ditton.

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:38.680
 Promp-pomp.

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:43.080
 Oh, yeah. It was-- it was better.

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:44.280
 James, this was better, actually,

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:45.280
 even though yours was right out.

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:47.200
 That's sorry.

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:48.920
 Anyway, yeah, no, the blurb says it's

00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:51.320
 to mark the 200th anniversary with a signature

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:53.720
 memorized presentation and performance from the all-

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:55.080
 Imagine if they fuck it up.

00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:56.600
 Oh, it's great.

00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:59.440
 One person is going to do da, da, da, da, da, da, da.

00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:01.080
 They're going to do it.

00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:02.480
 They're all going to be lost.

00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:04.320
 The conductor's going to be walking into walls.

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:07.320
 There's going to be the soon players toppling over.

00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:10.080
 Pomp-pomp's Bruce Springsteen saved the day.

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:12.680
 [LAUGHTER]

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:14.400
 Oh, anyway.

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:15.360
 So, great.

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:16.040
 Exciting.

00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:17.120
 Very exciting.

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:18.960
 Ellie Rose writes, pretty sure you don't actually

00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:21.840
 want to know this, but Wendy's fries--

00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:23.800
 so we were talking about-- what was it?

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:25.800
 Someone-- there was a murder case

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:28.480
 that was kind of half-solved by the fact

00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:31.040
 that Wendy's fry was found during the autopsy, right?

00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:32.960
 Yeah, that's absolutely correct, yes.

00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:35.120
 And they're specific fries.

00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:36.800
 And I think we said, oh, we can't tell--

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:38.760
 is there a difference between McDonald's and Wendy's,

00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:39.720
 which there obviously will be.

00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:41.520
 Exactly, and they looked at the nearby Wendy's

00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:44.080
 and found one of the criminals had been to a Wendy's.

00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:45.000
 It's like CCTV footage.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:45.760
 Yeah, exactly.

00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:47.920
 Well, Ellie Rose writes, pretty sure you don't actually

00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:49.320
 want to know this, but Wendy's fries

00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:50.960
 are one of the few fast food places

00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:53.960
 that leave the skin on potatoes.

00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:57.400
 Whereas Zachary Peters sends an alternative explanation,

00:07:57.400 --> 00:07:58.760
 how did the forensic investigators

00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:00.160
 know the fries were from Wendy's?

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:01.520
 Easy, they were cold.

00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:04.520
 [LAUGHTER]

00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:06.600
 That's superb.

00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:07.440
 There you go.

00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:08.720
 That's balance, you see?

00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:10.520
 That's, you know, pro Wendy's and anti-Wendy's.

00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:11.360
 Absolutely.

00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:14.240
 Douglas Fudd writes, he's the professor

00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:16.480
 at the Schmidt College of Science and Technology

00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:18.400
 in Chapman University, California.

00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:21.080
 This is not a comment about Anna's Lawrence of Elabia,

00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:22.840
 Freudian slip.

00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:25.080
 So I don't know why Douglas opens with that actually,

00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:25.560
 but--

00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:27.240
 [LAUGHTER]

00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:30.000
 That's a dragon's bite there.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:34.400
 Yeah, it has to do with a witty comment that James made

00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:36.880
 when you were discussing Hitler's eagle's nest.

00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:37.160
 Oh, yeah.

00:08:37.160 --> 00:08:37.760
 Do you remember it?

00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:38.680
 Ari and B&B.

00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:41.640
 James made a joke about Ari and B&B, which was very funny.

00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:42.080
 Thank you.

00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:42.640
 And perhaps--

00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:43.640
 Thank you, Professor Fudge.

00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:45.040
 Yeah.

00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:47.840
 And perhaps funnier than he realized.

00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:49.040
 Oh, no, I knew it was good.

00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:50.840
 [LAUGHTER]

00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:55.200
 Well, an airy is another name for an eagle's nest.

00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:56.120
 An airy, yeah.

00:08:56.120 --> 00:08:57.360
 Which is-- many of your listeners

00:08:57.360 --> 00:08:59.400
 will know because it is a common crossword word.

00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:01.400
 I suppose it might have been intentional.

00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:03.800
 And if so, it was an impressive double pun.

00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:05.640
 If it wasn't, I just thought I'd point it out.

00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:06.480
 Yeah, thanks.

00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:09.680
 Yeah, I hadn't thought of that, although I do know what an airy is.

00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:11.680
 So it's even funnier than you realized.

00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:12.160
 Yeah.

00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:13.200
 That's good.

00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:13.840
 That's great.

00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:15.240
 You're operating at a high level now.

00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:15.840
 I am.

00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:17.360
 Your side conscious is beyond you.

00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:21.040
 The puns are so good that even I don't get them.

00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:22.760
 This is a riddle from a listener now.

00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:24.000
 Ooh, yes.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:24.800
 Riddle, Connor.

00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:25.920
 Riddle me this.

00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:32.880
 Why is the lighthouse in the Azores on the island of Fayal

00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:36.960
 abandoned as of the 1950s?

00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:39.120
 OK.

00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:41.280
 I feel like I might have heard this before.

00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:43.560
 Fayal in the Azores is a lighthouse.

00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:45.080
 OK, yeah.

00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:47.440
 Abandoned since the '50s.

00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:48.800
 What happened in the '50s?

00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:51.000
 Nuclear testing.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:52.760
 Something happened that meant this lighthouse

00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:53.560
 was no longer useful.

00:09:53.560 --> 00:09:55.120
 A historical event we might know about.

00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:56.800
 Is this the one where someone went missing?

00:09:56.800 --> 00:10:00.040
 It was like a murder case where suddenly

00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:02.000
 the three people who were running the lighthouse

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:03.160
 just disappeared.

00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:06.480
 And so it's sort of a cold case still.

00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:08.000
 It's not that one, but that's very good.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.800
 I like that, yeah.

00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:12.680
 What makes a lighthouse useful?

00:10:12.680 --> 00:10:14.840
 It can stop ships from crashing into the rocks.

00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:17.240
 And what would stop a lighthouse from carrying out its function?

00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:19.480
 A bulb, big enough to sit in that.

00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:22.080
 If it was always daytime, you wouldn't need it.

00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:23.120
 OK, yeah.

00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:24.040
 Keep thinking.

00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:25.360
 So water.

00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:26.000
 Yeah.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.560
 But what's important for the ships to be able to see?

00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:29.280
 The rocks.

00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:30.360
 The light from the lighthouse.

00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:31.600
 Oh, the lighthouse, yeah.

00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:32.080
 Not the rocks.

00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:32.680
 The not the rocks.

00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:33.720
 They can't see the rocks.

00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:35.240
 No, that's why you've got to see the light.

00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:37.520
 So the bulb is burnt out and they can't afford anyone.

00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:39.240
 It's not the bulb burning out that stops

00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:41.520
 this lighthouse being visible from the short.

00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:44.480
 Oh, someone's built a wall in front of it.

00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:47.360
 Someone's built a new high-rise apartment right next to it

00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:48.720
 so you can't see it anymore.

00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:49.440
 Shall I tell you?

00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:50.800
 You're closer, James.

00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:52.520
 It went into disuse because a mountain

00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:56.640
 had sprang out of the ocean in front of it.

00:10:56.640 --> 00:10:57.960
 That's amazing.

00:10:57.960 --> 00:10:58.640
 That's brilliant.

00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:00.520
 It's called the Vulcao dos Capelinios.

00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:01.400
 And it was created.

00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:03.400
 With this mountain by a volcanic eruption in the '50s.

00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:04.200
 That's stunning.

00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:05.200
 That is amazing.

00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:06.520
 That's so good.

00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:07.800
 That's incredible.

00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:10.960
 If you want to hear us scrambling towards any other answers,

00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:13.080
 you can listen to us on Tom Scott's podcast

00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:13.760
 in a few weeks.

00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:14.240
 Yeah.

00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:15.600
 Which we're going to be on lateral.

00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:16.440
 Lateral.

00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:17.840
 We're going to be on the 100th episode.

00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:18.440
 It's really fun.

00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:19.080
 Very good fun.

00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:20.320
 Yeah.

00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:21.760
 Here's a thanks but no thanks.

00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:24.200
 I don't know if you remember what this format point is.

00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:25.720
 A suggestion is being made to the show.

00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:26.320
 Yeah.

00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:27.400
 We definitely won't do it.

00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:28.320
 Thanks.

00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:28.960
 No thanks.

00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:32.800
 So Matt T writes, on a recent walkthrough sandwich in Kent,

00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:35.200
 which is located near Ham, very good,

00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:37.880
 my friend mentioned his dad saw a cow with a window

00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:39.520
 in the side of its body.

00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:40.360
 Cool.

00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:42.040
 I've never seen one of those in real life.

00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:43.040
 Wow.

00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:44.440
 I can't remember why they've got windows.

00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:46.480
 So you can see inside them.

00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:48.280
 See how much milk is left.

00:11:48.280 --> 00:11:50.960
 It's neither of those things.

00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:52.200
 Like a slurpy machine.

00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:54.440
 Normally, you have to shake the cow upside down a bit

00:11:54.440 --> 00:11:57.400
 and say, oh, we need to go and get another cow.

00:11:57.400 --> 00:11:59.880
 They have imperial on one side and then

00:11:59.880 --> 00:12:01.640
 mention it on the other side, actually.

00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:03.760
 They're born like that.

00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:06.400
 Yes, so it's because-- so if you've got a sick cow,

00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:08.160
 then you can replace its stomach contents

00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:10.040
 with the stomach contents of a healthy cow,

00:12:10.040 --> 00:12:13.840
 and it'll get the nice healthy bacteria in the microbiome.

00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:15.920
 So to get the stuff out of the healthy cow,

00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:17.520
 you cut a little hole in its stomach,

00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:19.680
 so you can put your arm in when you need to take stuff out,

00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:20.480
 put it in the other cow.

00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:21.480
 It's a reusable window.

00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:22.480
 It's a reusable window.

00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:23.600
 You just open the window.

00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:24.680
 Doesn't harm the cow.

00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:27.000
 Probably embarrasses it a bit.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:28.520
 So a slurpy cow with a window in it, cool.

00:12:28.520 --> 00:12:29.520
 Yes, cool.

00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:30.320
 And the mat goes on.

00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:32.120
 However, the reason I wanted to email--

00:12:32.120 --> 00:12:34.760
 a lot of curveballs.

00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:38.240
 It's about Abbott's joke about Lawrence of Arabia.

00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:40.520
 Anyway, the reason I wanted to email Matt says,

00:12:40.520 --> 00:12:42.600
 is to suggest a new format for bonus material.

00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:43.560
 Oh yeah, great.

00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:45.400
 My work for a legal technology company

00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:48.880
 that houses the world's laws, dating back to 1163.

00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:51.560
 And I'm always fascinated by interesting facts about the law.

00:12:51.560 --> 00:12:54.520
 Often, on fish, you have good law-related facts.

00:12:54.520 --> 00:12:56.240
 So how about a new format where you focus

00:12:56.240 --> 00:12:58.120
 on a single topic, such as the law,

00:12:58.120 --> 00:13:00.720
 or golf, for James, yetis, for Dan, et cetera.

00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:04.320
 Essentially, a topic deep dive.

00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:05.280
 Not a bad suggestion.

00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:05.960
 Yeah.

00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:08.000
 Let's cut this but out in case we use it.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:09.760
 We don't want to have to credit him.

00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:12.560
 I mean, essentially, we do that four times in every show,

00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:14.440
 don't we, deep dive, subject.

00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:16.040
 So who's going to say the phrase?

00:13:16.040 --> 00:13:18.000
 Thanks, but no thanks.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:19.640
 There we go.

00:13:19.640 --> 00:13:20.560
 No, it's a nice idea.

00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:21.400
 It is a nice idea.

00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:22.000
 No, really, thanks.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:23.960
 And also, it sounds like you've got loads of great law facts.

00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:27.560
 You send us good nuggets of original laws.

00:13:27.560 --> 00:13:28.600
 Here's one.

00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:29.600
 This is a good one.

00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:32.680
 From Chris Rowe, we talked about selling time, remember that?

00:13:32.680 --> 00:13:33.680
 Yeah.

00:13:33.680 --> 00:13:36.280
 And the barter system on another recent episode.

00:13:36.280 --> 00:13:37.520
 So this is great.

00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:39.160
 I used to live in Glastonbury, says Chris,

00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:42.560
 and was part of the Let's scheme, Local Exchange and Trading,

00:13:42.560 --> 00:13:44.960
 where people traded time.

00:13:44.960 --> 00:13:46.720
 The service you offered, like gardening,

00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:48.240
 would be listed in a directory.

00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:50.440
 Anyone in the scheme can request some gardening time,

00:13:50.440 --> 00:13:51.880
 if that's what you're offering.

00:13:51.880 --> 00:13:55.080
 And they would pay you a fixed amount per hour of credit,

00:13:55.080 --> 00:13:57.280
 and you would use your credits to buy another service

00:13:57.280 --> 00:13:58.240
 from this directory, right?

00:13:58.240 --> 00:13:59.280
 Yeah, that's cool.

00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:01.960
 If anyone left the scheme, the only thing lost was time.

00:14:01.960 --> 00:14:03.280
 It was all very altruistic.

00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:05.080
 However, it all fell apart for us

00:14:05.080 --> 00:14:07.160
 when some individuals said an hour of their time

00:14:07.160 --> 00:14:09.560
 was worth more because they were a piano teacher,

00:14:09.560 --> 00:14:11.120
 whereas you were a cleaner.

00:14:11.120 --> 00:14:12.720
 Well, actually, that's really interesting,

00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:16.760
 because I think we said when we discussed these utopian societies

00:14:16.760 --> 00:14:19.760
 that that is a problem that they constantly came up against.

00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:21.280
 It's like whose time is worth the most.

00:14:21.280 --> 00:14:23.600
 If you are able to build houses,

00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:26.040
 then maybe your time is more useful

00:14:26.040 --> 00:14:27.720
 than someone who makes podcasts.

00:14:27.720 --> 00:14:29.000
 Well, relevant.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.840
 Chris finishes with, "This was a moot point in any case,

00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:34.080
 "as, being Glastonbury, there were 17 people

00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:35.360
 "offering to massage your aura,

00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:37.200
 "and only one that could unblock your loo."

00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:39.440
 (laughing)

00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:45.760
 I think I said that I have a time bank in my village as well.

00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:46.760
 Yeah, that's right.

00:14:46.760 --> 00:14:49.400
 But it also doesn't work that well,

00:14:49.400 --> 00:14:53.040
 because loads of people want to offer their time,

00:14:53.040 --> 00:14:55.640
 but people don't really need stuff.

00:14:55.640 --> 00:14:57.480
 So they end up just having cake sales

00:14:57.480 --> 00:14:58.520
 where they give cakes to each other.

00:14:58.520 --> 00:14:59.920
 Have you offered your time?

00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:01.440
 No, no, I haven't. I would. I should.

00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:02.920
 What skills do you have, though?

00:15:02.920 --> 00:15:04.720
 You can't unblock a toilet, I reckon.

00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:06.440
 Just give them a one-man podcast.

00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:07.760
 One-woman podcast.

00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:09.840
 (laughing)

00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:11.360
 In exchange for doing my garden.

00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:13.600
 (laughing)

00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:16.440
 Here's Alan Williams.

00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:19.960
 What was said about the tuber part in Dvorak's,

00:15:19.960 --> 00:15:20.920
 is it Dvorak?

00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:22.040
 Dvorak. Dvorak, yeah.

00:15:22.040 --> 00:15:23.640
 What was said about the tuber part

00:15:23.640 --> 00:15:26.560
 in Dvorak's New World Symphony is Bollocks.

00:15:26.560 --> 00:15:27.880
 Oh, how interesting.

00:15:27.880 --> 00:15:28.720
 Okay, go on.

00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:30.000
 But I think we said that it,

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:31.160
 did we say that it was a-

00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:32.560
 I think we said it was a story.

00:15:32.560 --> 00:15:34.680
 Yeah, it depends what he's saying, it's Bollocks.

00:15:34.680 --> 00:15:35.520
 So we would say-

00:15:35.520 --> 00:15:36.960
 It's not Bollocks from the Hovis adverts,

00:15:36.960 --> 00:15:38.440
 that's not Bollocks.

00:15:38.440 --> 00:15:39.920
 We said that there were seven tuber nights

00:15:39.920 --> 00:15:41.600
 at the beginning and seven at the end,

00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:42.960
 and it was because-

00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:44.920
 There was a rumour it was because

00:15:44.920 --> 00:15:47.520
 he wanted to keep the tuba player in the orchestra

00:15:47.520 --> 00:15:48.600
 so that he didn't shag his wife.

00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:49.840
 'Cause the tuba player had been falling in love

00:15:49.840 --> 00:15:51.000
 with Dvorak's wife?

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:51.840
 Yeah, but that was real.

00:15:51.840 --> 00:15:54.360
 Was he in love shagging, it was, yeah.

00:15:54.360 --> 00:15:56.160
 Well, Alan disagrees strongly.

00:15:56.160 --> 00:15:57.720
 He says, "I was at a concert in Bramford

00:15:57.720 --> 00:15:59.720
 with the Hala conducted by Sir Mark Elder,

00:15:59.720 --> 00:16:01.600
 and he highlighted the fact that the tuber part

00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:04.520
 was just 40 notes at the beginning of the slow movement,

00:16:04.520 --> 00:16:06.920
 not two separate sequences of seven notes,

00:16:06.920 --> 00:16:09.040
 and he had the orchestra play the relevant section with

00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:12.260
 and without the tuber before performing the entire symphony.

00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:14.320
 This showed conclusively that these 40 notes

00:16:14.320 --> 00:16:16.960
 contributed significantly to the overall sound

00:16:16.960 --> 00:16:19.640
 and were very far from being superfluous.

00:16:19.640 --> 00:16:20.480
 Look, that's fair enough.

00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:22.600
 Sounds like it's a matter of opinion.

00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:25.080
 And, let's see a tuber player this guy,

00:16:25.080 --> 00:16:26.240
 'cause they are quite touchy.

00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:30.160
 He doesn't specify, there's a wrong tuber vibe

00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:31.000
 coming off of it.

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:33.480
 But apparently Dvorak did a great favour to tuber players

00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:36.640
 'cause their rate of pay was usually dependent

00:16:36.640 --> 00:16:40.280
 on performances and sessions where they're required at.

00:16:40.280 --> 00:16:42.480
 So you get paid, yeah, they don't just get paid per note.

00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:43.600
 That'd be really weird to get,

00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:45.840
 but how do you still get paid in a piece?

00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:49.040
 - They don't get paid according to the time they spend playing.

00:16:49.040 --> 00:16:51.560
 The tuber part as a bonus is also extremely easy,

00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:54.240
 being very slow and merely wandering up and down scales.

00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:56.080
 It is kerching for the tuber player.

00:16:56.080 --> 00:17:00.160
 - I think I'd rather have to play most of it

00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:02.560
 than have to sit there silently getting a sore ass

00:17:02.560 --> 00:17:06.000
 listening to my up themselves violinist colleagues.

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:07.560
 - It is quite dull to sit there

00:17:07.560 --> 00:17:09.400
 when you're not playing in an orchestra for sure.

00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:11.040
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:13.680
 Here is Kira Johnston from Scotland.

00:17:13.680 --> 00:17:14.520
 - Mm-hmm.

00:17:14.520 --> 00:17:16.600
 - I am writing from the break room in the hospital

00:17:16.600 --> 00:17:18.040
 where I work as a junior doctor,

00:17:18.040 --> 00:17:19.360
 where I'm currently catching a break

00:17:19.360 --> 00:17:21.040
 towards the end of a 12 hour night shift

00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:22.960
 and listening to episode 529.

00:17:22.960 --> 00:17:27.440
 - Yeah, did you hear that UK government 12 hour shift?

00:17:27.440 --> 00:17:29.840
 - Yeah, and also she's punishing herself

00:17:29.840 --> 00:17:32.200
 by listening to our podcast, I mean.

00:17:32.200 --> 00:17:34.280
 - I don't feel like you can really take it in

00:17:34.280 --> 00:17:35.840
 after that kind of session.

00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:37.600
 Get a good night's sleep, listen in the morning.

00:17:37.600 --> 00:17:39.720
 - Well, she says, "I thought you might be interested to know

00:17:39.720 --> 00:17:42.680
 that I'm not only carrying two pages or bleeps,

00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:44.680
 as we call them, but also a walkie-talkie."

00:17:44.680 --> 00:17:45.520
 - Oh, great.

00:17:45.520 --> 00:17:47.120
 - Really, a walkie-talkie?

00:17:47.120 --> 00:17:49.880
 - We've had a few emails from the pager community.

00:17:49.880 --> 00:17:52.160
 Bleeps pages are very useful

00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:56.040
 'cause they work without signal and everyone knows where to go.

00:17:56.040 --> 00:17:58.840
 Did we get any emails from anyone in the bleeper community

00:17:58.840 --> 00:18:03.560
 who is not a doctor or a nurse or, I don't remember.

00:18:03.560 --> 00:18:05.280
 - I think it's used by birdwatchers as well.

00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:06.120
 - How's it?

00:18:06.120 --> 00:18:08.840
 - I think there's a, yes, I think when they get a good Twitch,

00:18:08.840 --> 00:18:10.280
 they put a page out.

00:18:10.280 --> 00:18:11.120
 - Oh, that's nice.

00:18:11.120 --> 00:18:11.960
 - Something like that, I'm pretty sure.

00:18:11.960 --> 00:18:15.640
 - The networks are not there of sort of like UK Twitchers

00:18:15.640 --> 00:18:18.760
 or birdwatchers, sorry, they don't like the word Twitchers.

00:18:18.760 --> 00:18:20.120
 - These are the Twitchers 'cause they're just,

00:18:20.120 --> 00:18:23.760
 the bleepers tell you where the hot shit bird is.

00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:25.360
 So I think that's true, isn't it?

00:18:25.360 --> 00:18:27.000
 Please write in birdwatchers, isn't it?

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:28.560
 Twitchers are people who just get excited

00:18:28.560 --> 00:18:30.640
 about an exotic bird that turns up on our--

00:18:30.640 --> 00:18:31.760
 - They complete the lists.

00:18:31.760 --> 00:18:33.240
 Twitchers just want to complete the lists.

00:18:33.240 --> 00:18:36.080
 Birdwatchers want to understand the feathered friends.

00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:37.720
 - I see, yes, yeah.

00:18:37.720 --> 00:18:40.240
 - The most complete is.

00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:41.440
 - Here's Paul Rosenthal.

00:18:41.440 --> 00:18:42.280
 - Yep.

00:18:42.280 --> 00:18:43.120
 - I just listened to--

00:18:43.120 --> 00:18:44.400
 - There's a lot of roses in this, in bars.

00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:46.800
 - Oh yeah, we had Z Rosewood, Paul Rosenthal, good spot.

00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:48.560
 - And then another one who was called Rose.

00:18:48.560 --> 00:18:49.920
 - Do we?

00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:50.920
 - Chris Rowe.

00:18:50.920 --> 00:18:53.160
 - Do you alphabetize all of these emails?

00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:54.000
 - Of course.

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:54.840
 - R, R-O.

00:18:54.840 --> 00:18:57.520
 - I listened to your recent episode

00:18:57.520 --> 00:18:59.040
 describing American dry states

00:18:59.040 --> 00:19:00.920
 banning alcohol sales at 30,000 feet.

00:19:00.920 --> 00:19:01.760
 - Oh yes.

00:19:01.760 --> 00:19:03.680
 - I wanted to share a similar story at ground level.

00:19:03.680 --> 00:19:06.000
 I grew up in California for my freshman year of college

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:10.120
 in 1973, traveled alone by train to New York.

00:19:10.120 --> 00:19:13.600
 On the second day of the uncomfortable three day journey,

00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:15.600
 old timers began walking up and down the train

00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:18.960
 announcing two hours to Kansas, then one hour to Kansas,

00:19:18.960 --> 00:19:21.920
 and ultimately 15 minutes to Kansas.

00:19:21.920 --> 00:19:24.080
 Kansas then banned the sale of alcohol,

00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:25.760
 but not the consumption.

00:19:25.760 --> 00:19:27.760
 So the bar had to close for as long as the train

00:19:27.760 --> 00:19:30.440
 was passing through Kansas.

00:19:30.440 --> 00:19:32.360
 But if you'd bought something, you could still drink it.

00:19:32.360 --> 00:19:34.880
 - That is a bit like on UK trains where they say,

00:19:34.880 --> 00:19:36.720
 "We're about to arrive in Carlisle

00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:39.280
 "when the train staff will change over,

00:19:39.280 --> 00:19:41.200
 "so you will not be able to buy the alcohol

00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:42.600
 "for the next 20 minutes."

00:19:42.600 --> 00:19:43.600
 (laughing)

00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:46.200
 And everyone in the carriage just furtively stands up

00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:48.920
 and shuffles down the character.

00:19:48.920 --> 00:19:51.240
 - And he says it was mid-afternoon when this happened,

00:19:51.240 --> 00:19:53.120
 but people rushed to the bar in panic

00:19:53.120 --> 00:19:54.560
 and started snapping up beer.

00:19:54.560 --> 00:19:56.480
 It didn't take long before the entire Amtrak train

00:19:56.480 --> 00:19:57.720
 was plastered.

00:19:57.720 --> 00:19:59.160
 Someone decided it would be appropriate

00:19:59.160 --> 00:20:01.240
 to hurl the empty beer bottles out of the window

00:20:01.240 --> 00:20:02.720
 into Kansas.

00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:04.320
 The windows were all sealed,

00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:05.840
 but that didn't stop pickled passengers

00:20:05.840 --> 00:20:07.160
 from clawing at the windows.

00:20:07.160 --> 00:20:08.000
 - Wow.

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:08.840
 - That was terrifying.

00:20:08.840 --> 00:20:09.680
 - Yeah, that doesn't sound great.

00:20:09.680 --> 00:20:11.160
 - Pretty frightening story, yeah.

00:20:11.160 --> 00:20:12.640
 - But it does mean, presumably the announcement,

00:20:12.640 --> 00:20:14.400
 "We're not in Kansas anymore."

00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:16.640
 Had a very different tone on that train.

00:20:16.640 --> 00:20:18.160
 (laughing)

00:20:18.160 --> 00:20:20.000
 Yay!

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:20.840
 - Oh, brilliant.

00:20:20.840 --> 00:20:22.200
 - That's so good.

00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:23.120
 - Ed Robinson.

00:20:23.120 --> 00:20:24.600
 - So it's another R.O.

00:20:24.600 --> 00:20:28.040
 - Yeah, I think Kandy's alphabetized all of the--

00:20:28.040 --> 00:20:28.880
 - It must be.

00:20:28.880 --> 00:20:29.720
 - Correspondence.

00:20:29.720 --> 00:20:30.800
 - Imagine if your inbox is in alphabetical order

00:20:30.800 --> 00:20:32.200
 rather than order of arrival.

00:20:32.200 --> 00:20:33.520
 - Yeah, what's wrong with that?

00:20:33.520 --> 00:20:35.760
 (laughing)

00:20:35.760 --> 00:20:40.400
 - So Ed Robinson writes, "In 2017 I was very interested

00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:42.320
 to hear in the latest episode that the Tin Opener

00:20:42.320 --> 00:20:45.520
 was invented several years after the invention of the tin."

00:20:45.520 --> 00:20:47.920
 I think we said some decades, didn't we?

00:20:47.920 --> 00:20:49.440
 This was a particular note to me,

00:20:49.440 --> 00:20:51.160
 as for most of my adult life,

00:20:51.160 --> 00:20:53.840
 I've been telling people as a bit of after-dinner trivia

00:20:53.840 --> 00:20:56.960
 that the tin was invented several years

00:20:56.960 --> 00:20:59.480
 after the invention of the tin opener.

00:20:59.480 --> 00:21:03.360
 I've never quite been able to explain to people why

00:21:03.360 --> 00:21:04.760
 they would have done that.

00:21:04.760 --> 00:21:05.600
 - I love that.

00:21:05.600 --> 00:21:07.040
 (laughing)

00:21:07.040 --> 00:21:08.200
 - So close.

00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:10.840
 - Just a classic half-remembering of a fact.

00:21:10.840 --> 00:21:13.760
 (laughing)

00:21:13.760 --> 00:21:15.120
 - It would be a better fact.

00:21:15.120 --> 00:21:16.480
 It would be an even more amazing fact.

00:21:16.480 --> 00:21:17.920
 - Of his stunning fact.

00:21:17.920 --> 00:21:19.160
 (laughing)

00:21:19.160 --> 00:21:20.920
 - The psychics again.

00:21:20.920 --> 00:21:23.520
 - Oh dear, love it.

00:21:23.520 --> 00:21:26.840
 Here's a Danish correspondent called Søren.

00:21:26.840 --> 00:21:27.680
 - Søren.

00:21:27.680 --> 00:21:29.640
 - Which is an anagram of Rose N.

00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:31.520
 (laughing)

00:21:31.520 --> 00:21:32.360
 - Wow.

00:21:33.160 --> 00:21:34.120
 - Something is going on.

00:21:34.120 --> 00:21:38.160
 - Søren B, a maritime pilot from Denmark.

00:21:38.160 --> 00:21:39.480
 Pretty cool.

00:21:39.480 --> 00:21:41.040
 - Okay.

00:21:41.040 --> 00:21:42.480
 - I've just listened to episode 42.

00:21:42.480 --> 00:21:45.120
 - Who does like aircraft carrier?

00:21:45.120 --> 00:21:46.760
 - No, I think that means that you,

00:21:46.760 --> 00:21:48.320
 so certain large ships,

00:21:48.320 --> 00:21:50.480
 when they're going out of a harbor,

00:21:50.480 --> 00:21:53.320
 they need a specific driver pilot to come in

00:21:53.320 --> 00:21:54.320
 and take them out.

00:21:54.320 --> 00:21:55.320
 - Sorry, of course.

00:21:55.320 --> 00:21:57.160
 - I think it's in there. - Yes, the harbor pilot.

00:21:57.160 --> 00:21:59.240
 - I also thought the pilot was sometimes just a word

00:21:59.240 --> 00:22:02.240
 to use for a person who captains a ship.

00:22:02.240 --> 00:22:03.080
 - Yeah.

00:22:03.080 --> 00:22:05.720
 - And I think it's that sort of very fine tune detail,

00:22:05.720 --> 00:22:06.840
 isn't it?

00:22:06.840 --> 00:22:10.600
 Episode 42.8, so Søren is a bit behind the curve.

00:22:10.600 --> 00:22:12.040
 You talk about squatting of ships

00:22:12.040 --> 00:22:13.760
 and how a cruise liner has to increase speed

00:22:13.760 --> 00:22:15.880
 to safely pass under the Great Belt Bridge.

00:22:15.880 --> 00:22:17.200
 - Oh yeah, that was a long time ago.

00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:18.520
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:22:18.520 --> 00:22:21.640
 - And Søren sails under the Great Belt Bridge almost daily.

00:22:21.640 --> 00:22:22.480
 - Really?

00:22:22.480 --> 00:22:23.320
 - It's just a cool thing.

00:22:23.320 --> 00:22:24.360
 - And he never knew this fact

00:22:24.360 --> 00:22:26.040
 and he's crashed into it every time.

00:22:26.040 --> 00:22:28.040
 (laughing)

00:22:28.040 --> 00:22:31.040
 - Is that the bridge between Copenhagen and Malmo,

00:22:31.040 --> 00:22:31.880
 that one?

00:22:31.880 --> 00:22:36.880
 - Between Ceyland and Sprogo, so don't know.

00:22:36.880 --> 00:22:39.600
 - Well, tack to Søren.

00:22:39.600 --> 00:22:41.040
 - Yeah, yeah, thank you, Søren.

00:22:41.040 --> 00:22:43.640
 - That's really cool though, that he drives that ship.

00:22:43.640 --> 00:22:47.160
 - Well, from sailing to dairy farms,

00:22:47.160 --> 00:22:49.880
 Clement de Menizes, right?

00:22:49.880 --> 00:22:51.080
 I've just listened to one of your wonderful

00:22:51.080 --> 00:22:53.800
 compilations on Club Fish, that's nice.

00:22:53.800 --> 00:22:56.760
 In it, Anna says that cows cannot lift one foot at a time.

00:22:56.760 --> 00:22:59.520
 I'm headheads, we're not on a dairy farm.

00:22:59.520 --> 00:23:00.360
 (laughing)

00:23:00.360 --> 00:23:04.240
 They've just been kicked in the bollocks by a cow.

00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:06.800
 That's so, I don't remember you ever saying that.

00:23:06.800 --> 00:23:09.160
 It's like, you're so unlikely, I would say that,

00:23:09.160 --> 00:23:11.160
 'cause it feels unlikely to be true.

00:23:11.160 --> 00:23:14.840
 - How would they walk anywhere if they can't lift one foot?

00:23:14.840 --> 00:23:16.520
 - They just slide everywhere.

00:23:16.520 --> 00:23:17.880
 - You do the two-legged, yeah.

00:23:17.880 --> 00:23:18.720
 - Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:20.240
 - Yeah, that's fine, it's still.

00:23:20.240 --> 00:23:21.080
 - Even so.

00:23:21.080 --> 00:23:22.160
 - Who do you say that?

00:23:22.160 --> 00:23:23.200
 - I don't recall that.

00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:24.040
 - Whoa.

00:23:24.040 --> 00:23:26.320
 - I mean, the reason for the compilations are,

00:23:26.320 --> 00:23:29.080
 the reason we have that material is either it's not true

00:23:29.080 --> 00:23:31.560
 or it doesn't fit in the podcast.

00:23:31.560 --> 00:23:33.440
 - I think the compilations are all true.

00:23:33.440 --> 00:23:35.840
 I don't think we should advertise that they're--

00:23:35.840 --> 00:23:36.680
 - No, there's some times--

00:23:36.680 --> 00:23:37.920
 - I don't know if they're right.

00:23:37.920 --> 00:23:39.720
 - Sometimes if we don't get things quite right,

00:23:39.720 --> 00:23:41.660
 but it's still funny, then I'll go with it.

00:23:41.660 --> 00:23:43.040
 - There's a slightly lower barrier,

00:23:43.040 --> 00:23:43.880
 isn't there, to entry?

00:23:43.880 --> 00:23:44.720
 - Yeah.

00:23:44.720 --> 00:23:46.480
 - Great, a barrier that a cow couldn't get over,

00:23:46.480 --> 00:23:49.040
 for instance, if one of them lifted any of its feet.

00:23:49.040 --> 00:23:52.520
 - Clemens says, the reason you tip a cow,

00:23:52.520 --> 00:23:54.080
 I mean, you were talking about cow tipping, maybe?

00:23:54.080 --> 00:23:54.920
 - Okay.

00:23:54.920 --> 00:23:55.920
 - It's because it's much easier to put a shoe on

00:23:55.920 --> 00:23:57.560
 when they're on their side.

00:23:57.560 --> 00:24:00.600
 We still put shoes on cows to help with several foot problems.

00:24:00.600 --> 00:24:04.800
 And you can get special crushes that tip the cow over

00:24:04.800 --> 00:24:06.560
 to make hoof trimming easier.

00:24:06.560 --> 00:24:07.400
 - Okay.

00:24:07.400 --> 00:24:08.240
 - Okay.

00:24:08.240 --> 00:24:09.080
 So thank you, Clement.

00:24:09.080 --> 00:24:11.320
 - That's cool, okay, I do vaguely remember now

00:24:11.320 --> 00:24:14.160
 thinking about getting one foot of a cow up.

00:24:14.160 --> 00:24:15.240
 - Steve Bullock.

00:24:15.240 --> 00:24:16.080
 That's weird.

00:24:16.080 --> 00:24:20.000
 - I'm stuck here.

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:21.200
 Can't move my feet.

00:24:21.200 --> 00:24:26.400
 - Stephen Bullock says, nestled in the latest episode,

00:24:26.400 --> 00:24:29.200
 among the talk of muffs, muff diving and muff warmers,

00:24:29.200 --> 00:24:30.760
 it was mentioned that on grand tours,

00:24:30.760 --> 00:24:34.120
 pigs would be employed to pre-warm beds for the taurers.

00:24:34.120 --> 00:24:35.400
 - Oh, okay, yeah.

00:24:35.400 --> 00:24:37.440
 - My now departed dad, who fancied himself

00:24:37.440 --> 00:24:40.880
 as entrepreneurially minded and grew up in poor circumstances,

00:24:40.880 --> 00:24:43.000
 always claimed with some pride that his first job

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:46.680
 was as a child in the forties as a professional bed warmer

00:24:46.680 --> 00:24:48.360
 for his older brother and sister,

00:24:48.360 --> 00:24:50.120
 for which he was paid a hip in a week.

00:24:50.120 --> 00:24:51.440
 - Aw, that's nice.

00:24:51.440 --> 00:24:53.280
 - Were he still here, I'd have enjoyed pointing out

00:24:53.280 --> 00:24:55.160
 that he missed a trick by not subcontracting

00:24:55.160 --> 00:24:56.800
 to a pig or other animal.

00:24:56.800 --> 00:24:58.840
 The great irony though, is that he was known

00:24:58.840 --> 00:25:00.440
 as something of a womanizer,

00:25:00.440 --> 00:25:05.040
 and so went on to warm many a bed that was not his own

00:25:05.040 --> 00:25:06.760
 throughout his life.

00:25:06.760 --> 00:25:07.600
 - This is terrible.

00:25:07.600 --> 00:25:08.920
 - This has turned a corner, hasn't it?

00:25:08.920 --> 00:25:10.040
 This little eunuchy.

00:25:10.040 --> 00:25:12.880
 Good on in.

00:25:12.880 --> 00:25:14.920
 - There you go, thank you, Stephen.

00:25:14.920 --> 00:25:17.800
 - Got that practice of bed warming in early.

00:25:17.800 --> 00:25:19.040
 - That's ridiculous.

00:25:19.040 --> 00:25:23.040
 - Here's quite a niche one.

00:25:24.440 --> 00:25:26.560
 Pamela, Pamela Cowey?

00:25:26.560 --> 00:25:30.000
 Sorry, no, Pamela Cowey.

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:31.360
 - Oh, my God.

00:25:31.360 --> 00:25:33.200
 - Dairy farmer, Bullock and Cowey.

00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:35.840
 - This is starting to blow a bit open.

00:25:35.840 --> 00:25:37.760
 - Whoa, yeah, yeah.

00:25:37.760 --> 00:25:39.480
 Nitrogen, the Haber process,

00:25:39.480 --> 00:25:41.480
 Haber, Billingham and Ammonia.

00:25:41.480 --> 00:25:44.400
 Billingham has two local non-league football teams,

00:25:44.400 --> 00:25:46.080
 Northern League Div 2.

00:25:46.080 --> 00:25:47.480
 One is called Billingham Town,

00:25:47.480 --> 00:25:49.960
 the other is called Billingham Synthonia.

00:25:49.960 --> 00:25:51.080
 Do you remember Billingham is where they have

00:25:51.080 --> 00:25:51.920
 that

00:25:52.240 --> 00:25:53.680
 - Yeah, and it's just closed down, I think.

00:25:53.680 --> 00:25:54.520
 - Right.

00:25:54.520 --> 00:25:55.360
 - Yeah.

00:25:55.360 --> 00:25:56.200
 - That makes all the nitrogen.

00:25:56.200 --> 00:25:57.040
 - Yeah.

00:25:57.040 --> 00:26:00.600
 - Synthonia is a contraction of synthetic ammonia.

00:26:00.600 --> 00:26:01.440
 - Wow.

00:26:01.440 --> 00:26:02.280
 - That's awesome.

00:26:02.280 --> 00:26:03.800
 - The product made by ICI in Billingham

00:26:03.800 --> 00:26:05.720
 and with whom the club was associated.

00:26:05.720 --> 00:26:07.600
 Unable to afford the ground upgrading,

00:26:07.600 --> 00:26:09.280
 BS, Billingham Synthonia,

00:26:09.280 --> 00:26:11.680
 now play some 50 miles away in Stokesley.

00:26:11.680 --> 00:26:13.640
 - How ironic that they're named after something

00:26:13.640 --> 00:26:16.080
 used for fertile and fertilizing land

00:26:16.080 --> 00:26:17.960
 and they can't afford to upgrade their own.

00:26:17.960 --> 00:26:18.800
 - Brilliant.

00:26:18.800 --> 00:26:21.080
 And what lives on ground that you might fertilize?

00:26:21.080 --> 00:26:21.920
 - Cow's.

00:26:21.920 --> 00:26:23.280
 - Pamela Cowie.

00:26:23.280 --> 00:26:26.400
 - And once the cow creates its dung,

00:26:26.400 --> 00:26:27.720
 what can you first slice with that?

00:26:27.720 --> 00:26:29.040
 Roses.

00:26:29.040 --> 00:26:30.200
 - Yeah!

00:26:30.200 --> 00:26:31.640
 - Something weird has happened today.

00:26:31.640 --> 00:26:32.480
 - It's full circle.

00:26:32.480 --> 00:26:33.600
 - We've turned a corner.

00:26:33.600 --> 00:26:34.600
 - Yeah.

00:26:34.600 --> 00:26:35.440
 Bye.

00:26:35.440 --> 00:26:38.020
 (upbeat music)

00:26:38.020 --> 00:26:40.800
 Bye, everybody.

00:26:40.800 --> 00:26:42.040
 Bye, bye.

00:26:42.040 --> 00:26:43.480
 Goodbye.

00:26:43.480 --> 00:26:45.840
 Please email a podcast at qi.com.

00:26:45.840 --> 00:26:47.120
 If you want to contribute.

00:26:47.120 --> 00:26:47.960
 - Yeah.

00:26:47.960 --> 00:26:48.800
 - And why wouldn't you?

00:26:48.800 --> 00:26:49.640
 - Why wouldn't you?

00:26:49.640 --> 00:26:51.240
 - If your name ends with S,

00:26:51.240 --> 00:26:53.920
 because Andy will be hitting that bit of the alphabet

00:26:53.920 --> 00:26:55.800
 for next week's episode.

00:26:55.800 --> 00:26:57.120
 - Ends with S.

00:26:57.120 --> 00:26:58.080
 - Starts with S.

00:26:58.080 --> 00:26:59.080
 - Starts with S.

00:26:59.080 --> 00:26:59.920
 - I say ends with S.

00:26:59.920 --> 00:27:01.080
 - Yeah, you did it as odd, wasn't it?

00:27:01.080 --> 00:27:01.920
 - That's exciting.

00:27:01.920 --> 00:27:02.760
 - Yeah.

00:27:02.760 --> 00:27:03.600
 It's just coming at it from the other way.

00:27:03.600 --> 00:27:05.240
 - That's a good challenge, yeah.

00:27:05.240 --> 00:27:06.080
 - Is that a thanks note?

00:27:06.080 --> 00:27:06.920
 Yeah, thank you, everybody.

00:27:06.920 --> 00:27:08.360
 And thank you to the three of you.

00:27:08.360 --> 00:27:09.200
 - Got it.

00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:10.920
 (laughs)

00:27:10.920 --> 00:27:11.760
 - That's nice.

00:27:11.760 --> 00:27:13.040
 - It's great fun.

00:27:13.040 --> 00:27:15.120
 Oh, and to you, Andy, for doing all the hard work

00:27:15.120 --> 00:27:17.720
 and finding the emails and putting it together.

00:27:17.720 --> 00:27:18.560
 - Nothing.

00:27:18.560 --> 00:27:19.920
 - I do it for the love.

00:27:19.920 --> 00:27:21.080
 - Ah, okay, well then I retract.

00:27:21.080 --> 00:27:23.200
 (laughs)

00:27:23.200 --> 00:27:24.040
 - Bye.

00:27:24.040 --> 00:27:26.620
 (upbeat music)

00:27:26.620 --> 00:27:29.200
 (upbeat music)

00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:31.780
 (upbeat music)
