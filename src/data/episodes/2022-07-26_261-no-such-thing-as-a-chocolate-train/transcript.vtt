00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
 Hi everyone, before we start this week's show, which was recorded live in

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.440
 Ofkham, we want to let you know how you can come to one of our live events.

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:12.800
 Yes, we have a website. It has all of the places that we're going to be in the upcoming months.

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:17.040
 Some of them will be in the UK and Ireland for the rest of you living in Europe.

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:20.080
 We are going to Gothenburg, Stockholm, Oslo, Amsterdam,

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:24.640
 Grenigan, Geneva, Copenhagen and Antwerp and this is very exciting.

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:27.840
 We just announced two more dates. Can you guess where they are, Dan?

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.240
 You know where they are. Yes, I know.

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.680
 That was me trying to fake not knowing. It's Paris and Berlin.

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:35.280
 Paris and Berlin, wow.

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.640
 Yeah, we're so excited. Those tickets are going to go on sale this Friday.

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.040
 You can go to know such thing as a fish.com.

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:46.960
 We have a link to the British Irish and then all of these amazing European dates going as well.

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:49.760
 Do go for the Europeans as quick as you can, by the way, if you're living there

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:53.520
 because they are going quick. We expect Paris and Berlin will sell out in minutes.

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.640
 It's my prediction. Well, let's see if that prediction comes true, Daniel.

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:00.640
 But no matter what, we hope to see you there.

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:04.480
 Anyway, hope you enjoy this week's show. Again, recorded live in Ofkham.

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:08.320
 Okay, on with the show. On with the podcast.

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:23.600
 Hello and welcome to another episode of no such thing as a fish,

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.960
 a weekly podcast this week coming to you from Ofkham.

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:35.920
 My name is James Shriver and I am sitting here with Enich Zinsky,

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.400
 Andrew Huntson, Marie, and James Harkin.

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.400
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:45.600
 from the last seven days. And in no particular order,

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.360
 here we go, starting with you, James.

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:53.520
 Okay, my fact this week is that there is a man in the poll who can lick his own

00:01:53.520 --> 00:02:00.720
 forehead. And the reason I'm laughing to myself is because I know what he looks like.

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:05.760
 So if you're at home listening to this, then do Google it.

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:09.520
 And if you're in Ofkham, sat in front of us, then here's what he looks like.

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:17.360
 We told you at home it was worth googling.

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.680
 It's so amazing. What's so bizarre about him is that when you hear he can look his own

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:26.640
 forehead, you immediately think, "Oh my god, he makes his tongue really long."

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.440
 And little do you know, he makes his face really tiny.

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:33.840
 He's a little bit of both because he does have a really long tongue.

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:37.120
 You can sometimes see pictures where he sticks out. It's really, really long.

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:41.600
 He's basically, he's a 35-year-old bus driver from Urla Barri in the poll.

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:45.280
 And he says that he tries not to do this too often because he scares the children.

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:49.840
 Well, he says he's not been allowed to do it at work when he's on the bus.

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:53.520
 He says that A, the children get scared. And then with, he talks about adults.

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:58.960
 He says, "Even adults can lose consciousness when they watch me in action."

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:03.200
 But can you guys lick your nose with your tongue?

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:06.400
 No. It's quite rare, isn't it? Oh, wow.

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:14.800
 Again, oh, just Google pictures of people licking their tongue and you'll see what that is.

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:18.640
 I didn't realise it had a name, so 10% of people can do it, including me.

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:24.720
 It's called the Gaulin sign. Didn't know how to medical term.

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:27.040
 And you've tried doing the full forehead.

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:30.400
 I think I have to work up to that.

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:36.080
 It's really interesting, though, because this guy is kind of gurning.

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:40.000
 Are we saying it's gurning the sport where you scrunch your face into an amazing shape

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
 and you surprise people and win awards?

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.200
 You know, gurning the sport.

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:46.880
 Gurning, yeah. The Olympic sport of gurning, yeah.

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:53.440
 So the British and world obviously gurning championships, because no-one else does it.

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:58.960
 Makeup is banned, but manipulation of false teeth if you have them is permitted.

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:02.160
 And it really helps if you don't have many teeth.

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:05.360
 So this guy in Nepal has only one tooth, I believe.

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:06.880
 Oh, I see.

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:07.520
 You're okay.

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:08.080
 Oh, yeah.

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:14.400
 Okay. Yeah. And there's a gurning world champion called Peter Jackman, not to be confused with Peter Jackson,

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:19.600
 who he's won the championships four times and he had all of his teeth removed so that he could

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:21.840
 improve his technique. Wow, really. Yeah.

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:22.480
 Really?

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:23.120
 Yeah.

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:28.080
 There's an organisers that said age definitely helps in the competition, because your skin is much

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:33.120
 looser when you, when you age, it allows you to manipulate and crease up in ways.

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:35.120
 So you have an advantage if you're older.

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:39.040
 And I should say this world championship or British championship for the whole world,

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:40.480
 but only British people take part.

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:44.400
 And in fact, only people from Cumbria take part.

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:49.360
 Even the people of Devon look down on the voucher voucher.

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:53.920
 You know, in 2014 the two runners up were both Swedish.

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:56.480
 Oh, no, I didn't know that.

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:59.280
 But it takes place in the Egremont Crab Fair.

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:03.440
 And they say it's been happening since 1267.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.240
 At the fair, it seems might have been happening since then on and off, because we know that

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:11.760
 King Henry III granted a royal charter for a fair.

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:14.960
 We think probably the gurning hasn't taken part for all that time.

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:19.280
 Although there is a newspaper article in 1852 that says it's an ancient practice.

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:21.840
 So it has definitely been going on for a long time.

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:23.520
 Yeah.

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:27.200
 Yeah. I was reading an obituary of a guy called Lenny Wells.

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:28.480
 This is an obituary in the Guardian.

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:30.480
 And he died in the year 2000.

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:34.400
 And he was known for gurning in various TV adverts who is very good at gurning.

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:39.040
 It said, although he was also a keen rugby fan and devoted family man,

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:43.680
 it is for the unique rubberiness of his lips and cheeks that he will be most fondly remembered.

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:50.640
 That was one, that was the interview people who had taken part in contest with him.

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:54.960
 And one of the guys said, this one time Gordon Blacklock, another competitor,

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:56.640
 I'm sure you've heard of, another gurna.

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:02.480
 Gordon Blacklock was at head on points, but Lenny stepped up and pulled a face like a rhino's anus.

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:03.120
 I'm telling you.

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:10.080
 Is that a technical term?

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:13.760
 I'm telling you the audience went bizarre.

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:14.480
 Oh, no, no.

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:17.280
 I love to hear the commentators.

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:20.480
 I'm like, can I just come on up the back like a rhino's anus is?

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:26.640
 There was, in fact, I think the greatest champion of all time is Anne Woods,

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:29.760
 who was one of the woman's gurning title, 28 times.

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:32.080
 That's 28 years of gurning.

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:36.800
 She missed one crab fur when she was expecting a baby,

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:39.680
 and it probably pulling a lot of faces then as well.

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:45.920
 And in 2010, she collapsed after four minutes of intensive gurning,

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:47.120
 and had to be rushed to hospital.

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:49.920
 So there are injuries that happened in the sport.

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:52.560
 And actually Anne Woods died quite recently as well.

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:55.520
 She died in 2015, and I read her obituary,

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:58.240
 and it said that she always entered the gurning arena

00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:00.640
 to the tune of "You're gorgeous" by Baby Bird.

00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:05.920
 For reeners, like how many people are going to watch this thing?

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:09.600
 We mentioned before Mr. Rugley from Zimbabwe,

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:11.600
 so there's an annual Mr. Rugley competition in Zimbabwe,

00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:13.840
 which is very similar to the gurning.

00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:16.800
 And in 2015, there was a huge controversy,

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:21.280
 because the guy who won it, the runner-up, who was a previous winner

00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:22.800
 and had been thinking he would win it again,

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:24.400
 the runner-up said it's not fair.

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:27.040
 His argument is based on the fact that he's got a lot of teeth missing,

00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:28.800
 whereas my argument is natural.

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:32.960
 And the winners said, you know, "Suck it up."

00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:35.440
 He said, "They should just accept. I'm uglier than them."

00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:37.120
 He can only suck it up if he's no teeth.

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:41.360
 Get your teeth removed. Have some commitment.

00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:43.360
 Like, you know, a aforementioned champion.

00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:45.040
 Get them out.

00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:48.160
 On tongs, because this guy can lick his own forehead.

00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:52.160
 There's some new research has found that weightlifters have stronger tongs,

00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:55.360
 and runners have better tong endurance than normal people.

00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:57.840
 This is not amazing.

00:07:57.840 --> 00:08:01.680
 I've actually never watched the weightlifting.

00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:04.240
 Do they have a little tiny, a little weight lily for their tongs?

00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:06.240
 Well, they're doing the big ones with their arms.

00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:09.440
 What they thought is perhaps it's because you're working out more.

00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:11.120
 All of your muscles are stronger.

00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:14.640
 But actually, having good tong muscles is really important,

00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:16.240
 because it keeps your airways open.

00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:19.920
 So if your tong is stronger, then it means it keeps your airways open,

00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:21.440
 and maybe it's better for running,

00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:23.760
 better for keeping more oxygen in your bodies, stuff like that.

00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:28.320
 I think it's a very specific thing, the way you pronounce tongue from your part of the world.

00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:30.720
 And it just takes so long to get over the fact that it's tong,

00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:33.760
 and you're just thinking, "What, my fire tongs are perfectly strong."

00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:36.720
 Do you generally own fire tongs?

00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:38.560
 Of course, I don't have a fire.

00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:41.840
 I just jab the radiator with them sometimes.

00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:47.600
 Draffs have good tongs.

00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:53.360
 Really good tongs. They're tongs are half a meter long and at least half a meter.

00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:55.680
 So that's longer than my forearm?

00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:56.880
 Wow, how much do we see?

00:08:56.880 --> 00:08:58.880
 Is that outside or is that...

00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:01.520
 No, no, it's not outside, so quite a lot of it goes back into them, I think.

00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:02.880
 But you know, there's just a man outside.

00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:05.840
 If you've seen a giraffe, you know, lick a leaf off a tree.

00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:08.080
 Can they lick the ears?

00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:09.600
 Yes, they can lick the ears. That's right.

00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:12.560
 Yes, and they're also black or purple their tongs,

00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:16.080
 and they think that's because they spend 12 hours a day with their tongs out.

00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:19.600
 And they would be sunburnt on them if they didn't have sun protection.

00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:21.600
 So that's why they have black tongs, don't have tongs.

00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:24.960
 I'm just really self-conscious about saying that word now.

00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:32.240
 There was a doctor in the, I think, the 19th century.

00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:34.880
 There was a big debate over how you could prove that someone had died.

00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:38.160
 And there was a, I think he was French, doctor called Labaud.

00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:42.480
 And he said that you can save people who only appear to be dead.

00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:45.440
 You know, they fall into a swoon or they might be unconscious,

00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:46.960
 but they are revivable.

00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:49.440
 And he said the way to do it is to pull their tong

00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:51.360
 rhythmically for three hours.

00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:57.200
 He could do that for two hours and 59 minutes and then he got...

00:09:57.200 --> 00:10:03.040
 He swore, he swore that he'd done this.

00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:04.720
 He said he'd saved people doing it.

00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:08.320
 He said he'd saved an unconscious cow and a bulldog that had swooned.

00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:12.640
 And he invented a tongue-pulling machine which was, you know,

00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:16.400
 which pull the machine. And there was an assistant whose job was to turn the crank and pull the

00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:17.680
 tongue-pulling machine out. Oh my god.

00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:22.400
 I know. So he resigned because he was bored and he was replaced with an electric tongue-pulling machine.

00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:23.920
 So... Wow.

00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:28.320
 There's a hockey player called Brad, an ice hockey player called Brad Marchand.

00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:31.280
 And he has been ordered to stop licking his opponents.

00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:39.040
 He's done this more than once, but the most recent person he licked was opposition player Ryan

00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:45.280
 Callahan. And Marchand has been described in his official biography as the little ball of hate.

00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:48.320
 So... sort of the liquor overlicky.

00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:53.360
 That's the liquor who was that. And basically it's his job to kind of start fights and stuff like

00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:58.000
 that happens in hockey. But the guy who he licked said I don't know what the difference is between

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.040
 spitting in someone's face and licking it, which is quite a good point, I think.

00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:05.680
 And then the person who did the licking said, well, he punched me four times in the face.

00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:10.800
 [laughter]

00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:12.800
 This is a certain half a dozen isn't it?

00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:13.840
 [laughter]

00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:17.520
 Do you know how you start your tongue out when you concentrate or you may have done as a child?

00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:18.160
 Some people do, yeah.

00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:20.400
 I definitely did. And it's much more common in children.

00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:26.160
 And I was reading a article by a neurologist who said he thinks he knows why we do this.

00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:30.320
 And it's partly because if you're really concentrating, number one is because it stops the distraction

00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:34.480
 of taste or texture within your mouth. So if you just hang your tongue out, I guess it's not really

00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:38.880
 touching anything. It's not tasty or touching anything. But number two, he said it's because

00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:43.520
 breastfeeding babies stick their tongue out to push their mothers nipple away when they're full.

00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:47.280
 And so that's what we're doing when we're concentrating. We're saying leave me alone.

00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:49.120
 I've got stuff to be getting along with now.

00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:51.520
 [laughter]

00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:55.440
 I'll be honest, next time I stick my tongue out, I won't be able to concentrate quite as much

00:11:55.440 --> 00:11:59.120
 as I could before. [laughter]

00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:03.200
 Okay, it is time for fact number two and that is Andy.

00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:08.240
 My fact is that in 1903, you could buy a gramophone record made of chocolate,

00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:11.360
 which you could play a song on and then eat the disc.

00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:15.760
 And somehow we have lost this technology.

00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:16.960
 [laughter]

00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:19.920
 But I think the technology was never great to start with, was it?

00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:23.200
 You could play a song on a piece of chocolate. That was just what it was.

00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:26.480
 You could play a couple of times. I mean, there were great turntables either.

00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:30.560
 The design of the chocolate records. But so it was, this was made by a company called

00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:35.440
 the Stolverk Chocolate Company and there were tiny turntables and small chocolate records.

00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:37.520
 It was for children basically. It was a children's toy.

00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:41.440
 And you could play the song in a couple of times and then when you got bored, you could just eat the song.

00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:44.320
 And I think did they put foil on the chocolate, didn't they?

00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:48.000
 And it was the foil that they put the ridges in which acted like the record.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:52.400
 And then you could peel it because you don't want to be degrading your chocolate as you play a record.

00:12:52.400 --> 00:12:55.200
 No, quite. And you say that it was a children's toy.

00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:58.000
 It was advertised in the French magazine Lanature.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.120
 And it specifically said, "This is not a toy."

00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:04.800
 What kind of miserable person do you have to be?

00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:07.200
 We'll send you a chocolate gramophone record. It's not a toy.

00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:11.360
 Did it take off? No.

00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:15.680
 She probably, you don't have any chocolate records.

00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:19.200
 Did you think you were the only one in the world who hadn't picked up on this technology?

00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:22.000
 It's got a massive hot chocolate record collection.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.240
 I'm from Australia, maybe it hasn't reached yet.

00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:31.280
 Maybe we're getting it next year. But sometimes in the annals of history, you can have 50 years of chocolate records.

00:13:31.280 --> 00:13:34.560
 The Beatles were released on chocolate and then it goes.

00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:37.040
 I think it might have been a limited edition thing.

00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:40.320
 And they tried lots of other chocolate based things, this company.

00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:42.080
 So they also produced Stolverk.

00:13:42.080 --> 00:13:44.800
 They produced a chocolate clock and a chocolate train.

00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:48.960
 Which I think not a full on train.

00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:51.280
 People weren't going around in chocolate trains.

00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:53.360
 It's been going to Edinburgh to London.

00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:56.800
 Also, where was the cool world we could have left it?

00:13:56.800 --> 00:13:59.840
 I'm afraid there's more delays. Someone's eating the motor transport again.

00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:03.280
 There must be a better way.

00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:10.160
 All the sleepers are twixes and they're a pickaxes with the main rails.

00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:13.920
 Are there a little malteasers puffing out of the train?

00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:15.840
 Nice.

00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:17.200
 Okay.

00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:19.520
 It's nice. We all want to live in this world now, don't we?

00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:21.600
 Yeah, very cool.

00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:22.480
 It's not real.

00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:25.280
 But they're word toy trains.

00:14:25.280 --> 00:14:26.560
 I'm not quite sure how they work.

00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:28.560
 But yeah, chocolate clock, I don't know, I'm saying that works.

00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:29.920
 Because that's not a very useful clock.

00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:31.120
 That's not going to last a long time.

00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:32.560
 No, no.

00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:34.160
 So this is where they didn't take off.

00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:38.720
 Actually, I didn't even look up what the oldest piece of chocolate

00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:40.160
 still existing is.

00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:40.880
 There must be some.

00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:43.680
 They keep finding bits of chocolate from the Antarctic expeditions.

00:14:43.680 --> 00:14:47.840
 The Antarctic expeditions, just back to grammar phones.

00:14:47.840 --> 00:14:50.880
 There is a grammar phone that still is in Antarctica.

00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:52.960
 It's been there for over a hundred years.

00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:56.800
 Scott of the Antarctic took two grammar phones with him.

00:14:56.800 --> 00:14:57.680
 Two grammar?

00:14:57.680 --> 00:14:58.080
 Yeah.

00:14:58.080 --> 00:14:59.760
 He was a fucking idiot, wasn't he?

00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:00.240
 I mean...

00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:03.920
 I don't think he claims to feel sorry for him.

00:15:03.920 --> 00:15:05.680
 Wow.

00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:08.080
 I can imagine them in the tent at the end.

00:15:08.080 --> 00:15:10.080
 It's like we're so cold and hungry.

00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:12.320
 Can we eat the grammar phone?

00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:14.800
 You brought the chocolate one, right?

00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:18.320
 What was he thinking?

00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:20.080
 He brought hundreds of records.

00:15:20.080 --> 00:15:21.040
 That's amazing.

00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:23.920
 Yeah, and so the idea was, because obviously they were in the hut for ages.

00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:27.920
 So Sherry Garde, who wrote the worst journey in the world,

00:15:27.920 --> 00:15:29.680
 he said that after dinner every night,

00:15:29.680 --> 00:15:31.280
 that's when the records would go on.

00:15:31.280 --> 00:15:33.200
 And one was left there, and one made it back.

00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:33.920
 I've seen it.

00:15:33.920 --> 00:15:36.240
 There was an exhibition at the Natural History Museum in London.

00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:37.360
 I went to see it.

00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:41.840
 And they've actually made an album of the best of songs

00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:43.600
 that went along as a record.

00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:46.240
 But they couldn't play the records when they were out in the middle of nowhere.

00:15:46.240 --> 00:15:47.360
 They actually had notes.

00:15:47.360 --> 00:15:48.960
 No, because they had Scott's hut.

00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:50.080
 So it was in the hut that they did.

00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:51.920
 So before they went, probably, out in the middle of nowhere.

00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:54.160
 You could have wine, not grammar phones, as well.

00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:55.760
 The winding, okay.

00:15:55.760 --> 00:15:57.920
 With captain notes, I know your hands are very cold,

00:15:57.920 --> 00:16:02.160
 but would you mind taking them out of those gloves to wind up the grammar phone just one last time?

00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:04.000
 And then I promise you can go outside.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:08.240
 So this is quite a cool thing.

00:16:08.240 --> 00:16:10.480
 You know the new five-pound notes, the plastic ones?

00:16:10.480 --> 00:16:13.680
 Yes, you can play a grammar phone record with a five-pound note.

00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:15.600
 As the stylus, do you mean?

00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:17.280
 Yeah, so you sell the record spinning.

00:16:17.280 --> 00:16:19.520
 There's footage online that someone's doing it.

00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:21.760
 And it doesn't produce a brilliant sound.

00:16:21.760 --> 00:16:25.360
 And you need an amplifier and stuff, but you can do it.

00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:26.160
 Oh, really?

00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:28.560
 You could probably use that five-pound note to buy an actual stylus.

00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:32.480
 I do know that.

00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:33.680
 I couldn't believe this.

00:16:33.680 --> 00:16:38.240
 There were basically iPods in the 1920s.

00:16:38.240 --> 00:16:39.280
 I don't believe that.

00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:40.080
 Yeah.

00:16:40.080 --> 00:16:43.600
 Well, the word basically did a huge amount of heavy lifting with it, isn't it?

00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:45.520
 What did they have?

00:16:45.520 --> 00:16:48.640
 These were things called Mickey Fones or Mikey Fones.

00:16:48.640 --> 00:16:49.840
 There were little music players.

00:16:49.840 --> 00:16:53.280
 180,000 of them were produced in Switzerland.

00:16:53.280 --> 00:16:56.400
 And they were, basically, they were tiny little music players,

00:16:56.400 --> 00:16:57.840
 like grammar phones or phonographs,

00:16:57.840 --> 00:16:59.520
 that you could carry around in your handbag.

00:16:59.520 --> 00:17:02.320
 And they measured two by four inches.

00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:05.680
 And the only tiny thing about them was that they measured two by four inches

00:17:05.680 --> 00:17:07.760
 when they were packed up, but then whenever you got somewhere,

00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:11.520
 it was quite a complex assembly job to build a ten-inch record player.

00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:13.040
 So it couldn't play straight away.

00:17:13.040 --> 00:17:14.800
 But even so, these are possible.

00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:15.760
 That's really cool.

00:17:15.760 --> 00:17:17.280
 Tiny little music players.

00:17:17.280 --> 00:17:18.480
 Yeah, very cool.

00:17:18.480 --> 00:17:21.760
 Now, Edison, when he sort of came up with the phonograph,

00:17:21.760 --> 00:17:24.640
 which was the pre-cursor to grammar phone records, I guess,

00:17:24.640 --> 00:17:27.120
 he thought that their main use would be,

00:17:27.120 --> 00:17:29.840
 well, one of their main uses would be phonographic books,

00:17:29.840 --> 00:17:32.080
 which will speak to blind people, he said,

00:17:32.080 --> 00:17:33.680
 without any effort on their part.

00:17:33.680 --> 00:17:34.960
 Basically, a podcast.

00:17:34.960 --> 00:17:36.880
 It's an audio book or a podcast, yeah.

00:17:36.880 --> 00:17:38.160
 Wow.

00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:41.040
 The phonographic recorded as well, didn't it, as playing.

00:17:41.040 --> 00:17:42.880
 I think that was the point of that.

00:17:42.880 --> 00:17:45.280
 And one of the main things they used it for was to record

00:17:45.280 --> 00:17:47.360
 the last words of the dying.

00:17:47.360 --> 00:17:48.080
 Wow.

00:17:48.080 --> 00:17:49.760
 That's so much pressure on someone who's dying

00:17:49.760 --> 00:17:51.280
 to nail your last words.

00:17:51.280 --> 00:17:51.760
 Yeah.

00:17:51.760 --> 00:17:53.600
 And then what if you don't go for another hour?

00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:56.800
 You're just going to sit silently going, "I don't."

00:17:56.800 --> 00:17:58.560
 It would also make you very paranoid, wouldn't it?

00:17:58.560 --> 00:18:00.480
 If you just felt a little bit peaky,

00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:04.240
 and then your wife started getting the grammar phone rigged up in the corner.

00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:08.160
 Honestly, darling, it's a cold.

00:18:11.040 --> 00:18:12.960
 OK, we need to move on to our next fact.

00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:16.880
 It is time for fact number three, and that is Chazinsky.

00:18:16.880 --> 00:18:19.920
 My fact this week is that in the early 1700s,

00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:22.800
 the most popular British guide to the history,

00:18:22.800 --> 00:18:26.240
 language, and culture of Taiwan was written by a man

00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:28.800
 who didn't speak the language had never been there

00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:30.160
 and knew nothing about it.

00:18:30.160 --> 00:18:34.560
 This was in 1704, and I'd say Taiwan,

00:18:34.560 --> 00:18:37.840
 so it was Formosa then, which was what it was called,

00:18:37.840 --> 00:18:39.680
 and it was called the History of Formosa.

00:18:39.680 --> 00:18:43.200
 And it described in huge detail the practices

00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:46.640
 that these people who would have seemed so foreign to the people of Britain,

00:18:46.640 --> 00:18:49.200
 the practices that the Formosa people got up to,

00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:50.400
 their language and everything.

00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:53.520
 It was written by a guy called George Salmanetzar,

00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:55.760
 and it was completely fake.

00:18:55.760 --> 00:18:58.800
 He was a white, blonde, head, blue-eyed Frenchman

00:18:58.800 --> 00:19:00.400
 who'd never left Europe.

00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:03.360
 And to this day, we don't really know what his background was,

00:19:03.360 --> 00:19:07.440
 or what his real name was, because George Salmanetzar was a fate name.

00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:11.760
 And he just made this up. He convinced him that his pale skin

00:19:11.760 --> 00:19:16.480
 and his appearance of being French and his French accent were,

00:19:16.480 --> 00:19:21.040
 because in Formosa, the upper classes live in underground palaces,

00:19:21.040 --> 00:19:23.920
 so they never see the sun, which he'd never caught.

00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:25.760
 That's a good excuse, though, isn't it?

00:19:25.760 --> 00:19:28.240
 It's really quick thinking, yeah.

00:19:28.240 --> 00:19:32.160
 So he had this big showdown with the Royal Society of Scientists.

00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:34.160
 They were all questioning him for ages about,

00:19:34.160 --> 00:19:36.640
 "Right, so, okay, if you really are from Formosa,

00:19:36.640 --> 00:19:37.360
 what about this?"

00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:41.360
 So Edmund Hayley of Comet fame asked him,

00:19:41.360 --> 00:19:44.400
 "How long does the sun shine down your chimneys?"

00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:45.920
 And that's a really revealing question.

00:19:45.920 --> 00:19:46.800
 Yeah, but no, come on.

00:19:46.800 --> 00:19:50.240
 Like, if you went on holiday to Spain and they said to you,

00:19:50.240 --> 00:19:52.640
 "Yeah, but Andy, are you really from England?

00:19:52.640 --> 00:19:55.040
 How long does the sun shine down your chimney?"

00:19:55.040 --> 00:19:57.280
 I'd be stuffed, wouldn't I?

00:19:57.280 --> 00:19:58.000
 Exactly.

00:19:58.000 --> 00:19:59.120
 So how's he supposed to know it?

00:19:59.120 --> 00:20:01.520
 Because that answer would have revealed

00:20:01.520 --> 00:20:03.600
 if he knew where it was on the planet.

00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:04.640
 Did he have an answer to it?

00:20:04.640 --> 00:20:08.400
 He said, "We have bent chimneys, so the sun doesn't shine down your..."

00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:10.160
 Yeah, and they said good answer.

00:20:10.160 --> 00:20:10.640
 Brilliant.

00:20:10.640 --> 00:20:11.840
 Spiraled, wasn't it?

00:20:11.840 --> 00:20:13.920
 Yeah, spiral chimneys, yeah.

00:20:13.920 --> 00:20:15.040
 Yeah, he's amazing character.

00:20:15.040 --> 00:20:17.680
 He said at Formosa that the men walk naked

00:20:17.680 --> 00:20:21.200
 except for a gold or silver plate to cover their privates.

00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:23.040
 He said that they executed murderers

00:20:23.040 --> 00:20:26.000
 by hanging them upside down and shooting them full of arrows.

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:29.200
 And annually, they sacrificed the hearts of 18,000 young boys

00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:31.280
 to gods and priests to eat their bodies.

00:20:31.280 --> 00:20:31.920
 Yeah.

00:20:31.920 --> 00:20:35.040
 Which people did say to him if that is true

00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:36.960
 and they sacrificed that number of people,

00:20:36.960 --> 00:20:39.200
 you're not going to have many people left on this small island.

00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:40.960
 And he didn't have a good answer to that.

00:20:40.960 --> 00:20:43.840
 But he said, "Four Motions always sleep upright."

00:20:43.840 --> 00:20:45.440
 And he actually then saw this through

00:20:45.440 --> 00:20:47.120
 because he had to live the habits of them.

00:20:47.120 --> 00:20:48.720
 I'm so...

00:20:48.720 --> 00:20:50.720
 He lost a regret in that.

00:20:50.720 --> 00:20:54.480
 He used to, I think he sort of sat.

00:20:54.480 --> 00:20:56.800
 So he said a lot of Four Motions sleep standing up

00:20:56.800 --> 00:20:58.800
 and then he used to leave a candle on in his room.

00:20:58.800 --> 00:21:00.160
 So everyone could see that overnight

00:21:00.160 --> 00:21:02.400
 he was still erect in his chair

00:21:02.400 --> 00:21:03.200
 because he was Four Motions.

00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:04.800
 So he couldn't sleep in a normal bed.

00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:08.640
 Bizarrely, he said that they all eat food raw.

00:21:08.640 --> 00:21:09.920
 Things like fish raw.

00:21:09.920 --> 00:21:13.360
 And he was saying that Four Motions was part of Japan,

00:21:13.360 --> 00:21:14.560
 which is a bit weird because it was actually

00:21:14.560 --> 00:21:15.360
 belonged to China then.

00:21:15.360 --> 00:21:16.640
 But he said it was part of Japan.

00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:19.120
 So that's strange that he kind of predicted sushi

00:21:19.120 --> 00:21:21.440
 300 years before it happened.

00:21:21.440 --> 00:21:25.280
 So he got, basically, Four Motions was his third go at

00:21:25.280 --> 00:21:27.360
 trying to convince people he was from somewhere else.

00:21:27.360 --> 00:21:29.200
 So he was originally from France.

00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:31.680
 His first bash of it was saying he was Irish.

00:21:31.680 --> 00:21:33.280
 So he would go around saying, "I'm Irish."

00:21:33.280 --> 00:21:34.960
 But the thing is, everyone knew the Irish.

00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:36.240
 So they'd be like, "Oh, so what are you?"

00:21:36.240 --> 00:21:37.360
 And he was like, "I have no idea."

00:21:37.360 --> 00:21:39.520
 Just saying, "Quickly, that's stuff up on him."

00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:41.520
 "Oh, have you been to the dog and duck in Dublin?"

00:21:41.520 --> 00:21:42.800
 Yeah.

00:21:42.800 --> 00:21:44.480
 Then he said he was Japanese.

00:21:44.480 --> 00:21:45.040
 Right.

00:21:45.040 --> 00:21:46.480
 And then that failed on him as well

00:21:46.480 --> 00:21:48.240
 because Japan was getting too much.

00:21:48.240 --> 00:21:49.600
 People have been traveling there too much.

00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:50.880
 He needed to find somewhere else.

00:21:50.880 --> 00:21:53.440
 Formosa was the third one that he finally landed on,

00:21:53.440 --> 00:21:54.800
 which was useful to him.

00:21:54.800 --> 00:21:58.320
 Another time in Four Motions there was a lot of Jesuits,

00:21:58.320 --> 00:21:59.920
 Catholic missionaries.

00:21:59.920 --> 00:22:02.240
 And they knew everything that was happening there.

00:22:02.240 --> 00:22:04.400
 And so when he came along, they were going,

00:22:04.400 --> 00:22:06.240
 "No, no, really, that doesn't happen."

00:22:06.240 --> 00:22:09.440
 But weirdly, because no one trusted Catholics at the time,

00:22:09.440 --> 00:22:12.320
 they all trusted this one guy over all the Jesuits

00:22:12.320 --> 00:22:13.600
 who were saying, "No, this is bullshit."

00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:14.160
 That's so funny.

00:22:14.160 --> 00:22:16.000
 Well, at least the reputation of the church has recovered.

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:20.640
 But we should emphasize that this was a big deal this book.

00:22:20.640 --> 00:22:23.680
 Well, he wasn't just a weirdo with a pamphlet.

00:22:23.680 --> 00:22:26.960
 This was a book that was so believed that

00:22:26.960 --> 00:22:30.160
 he lectured, who was advised to selecture on Formosa culture

00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:32.160
 and language, Oxford University.

00:22:32.160 --> 00:22:35.200
 So he invented the entire language, alphabet and all,

00:22:35.200 --> 00:22:36.720
 completely new alphabet.

00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:39.520
 A linguist studied it to see how consistent it was

00:22:39.520 --> 00:22:41.040
 and agreed it was definitely language.

00:22:41.040 --> 00:22:43.600
 To the extent that it remained in lots of language books

00:22:43.600 --> 00:22:44.880
 until the mid 19th century.

00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:46.160
 And people were still saying this is...

00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:48.320
 People weren't doing GCSE Formosa, were they?

00:22:48.320 --> 00:22:53.440
 Can I tell you quickly just something amazing about Formosa yourself?

00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:56.240
 Formosa now Taiwan.

00:22:56.240 --> 00:23:00.160
 If you were in Formosa Taiwan, and you dug through the ground,

00:23:00.160 --> 00:23:03.520
 and you dug all the way through the earth onto the other side,

00:23:03.520 --> 00:23:06.240
 the antipode, as it's called,

00:23:06.240 --> 00:23:10.720
 you would land in a place called Formosa Argentina.

00:23:10.720 --> 00:23:12.080
 Is that right?

00:23:12.080 --> 00:23:12.560
 No.

00:23:12.560 --> 00:23:14.080
 By total coincidence.

00:23:14.080 --> 00:23:15.680
 Not by a coincidence, surely.

00:23:15.680 --> 00:23:16.880
 By coincidence, yeah.

00:23:16.880 --> 00:23:18.960
 There's no relation that as far as we can see

00:23:18.960 --> 00:23:20.880
 between the two places that you would land.

00:23:20.880 --> 00:23:23.040
 Yeah, there's a place in Argentina called Formosa.

00:23:23.040 --> 00:23:26.000
 I mean, let's all definitely Google this after the show.

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:26.480
 Sure.

00:23:26.480 --> 00:23:28.880
 That is incredible.

00:23:28.880 --> 00:23:31.280
 If that remains in the episode, that means it is true.

00:23:31.280 --> 00:23:33.440
 And that is unbelievable.

00:23:33.440 --> 00:23:35.520
 If not, you're welcome everywhere.

00:23:35.520 --> 00:23:38.320
 An exclusive.

00:23:38.320 --> 00:23:41.760
 It would be around Argentina, so that just makes sense.

00:23:41.760 --> 00:23:44.160
 So, we are in Devon at the moment.

00:23:44.160 --> 00:23:47.840
 And it seems like Devon is a bit of a hotbed for absolute fantasists.

00:23:47.840 --> 00:23:51.360
 Yeah, so Andy, you definitely know about Tuesday,

00:23:51.360 --> 00:23:52.560
 Lob sang Rampa, don't you?

00:23:52.560 --> 00:23:53.680
 Oh, you're just from Devon.

00:23:54.160 --> 00:23:55.360
 Was he, of course, too?

00:23:55.360 --> 00:23:59.040
 He was, he did a fraud saying he was a Tibetan monk.

00:23:59.040 --> 00:24:01.200
 And that was still happening in the 1950s.

00:24:01.200 --> 00:24:02.000
 He was saying that.

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:04.800
 He said that he came from Tibet.

00:24:04.800 --> 00:24:06.080
 He made up a language.

00:24:06.080 --> 00:24:09.920
 When they gave him actual Tibetan and said,

00:24:09.920 --> 00:24:11.440
 "Why do you not recognize this?"

00:24:11.440 --> 00:24:14.240
 He said that he'd been so badly tortured during the war.

00:24:14.240 --> 00:24:16.640
 He'd blocked out all knowledge of the Tibetan language.

00:24:16.640 --> 00:24:21.680
 And then afterwards, when they realized he wasn't actually Tibetan,

00:24:21.680 --> 00:24:26.320
 he said, "Oh, no, no, no. Actually, I was possessed by the spirit of a Tibetan monk

00:24:26.320 --> 00:24:30.160
 after I fell out of a tree in London while trying to take a photograph of an owl."

00:24:30.160 --> 00:24:34.720
 Yep, he was, his name was Cyril Hoskins,

00:24:34.720 --> 00:24:37.760
 and he was an unemployed surgical trust manufacturer from Devon,

00:24:37.760 --> 00:24:41.760
 who claimed to be an incredibly ancient and powerful Tibetan monk.

00:24:41.760 --> 00:24:42.960
 And he wrote 15 books.

00:24:42.960 --> 00:24:47.760
 He wrote "Travels with the Lama" and "Like Lama is in Del Lama."

00:24:47.760 --> 00:24:51.520
 And then he wrote one "Living with the Lama" which was dictated to him by his cat.

00:24:52.480 --> 00:24:53.520
 [laughter]

00:24:53.520 --> 00:24:55.200
 "Mrs. Fifi Gray Whiskers."

00:24:55.200 --> 00:25:01.680
 And then he moved to, he later, he moved to Ireland and then Canada blatantly for tax reasons.

00:25:01.680 --> 00:25:04.800
 Tell me you're up there. Yeah, he was great.

00:25:04.800 --> 00:25:07.280
 Yeah, and then back in the 18th century,

00:25:07.280 --> 00:25:11.120
 you had someone called Princess Karabou, who was also from Devon.

00:25:11.120 --> 00:25:14.480
 And she turned up at someone's house near Bristol,

00:25:14.480 --> 00:25:18.880
 speaking a fake language and said she was from somewhere in the east.

00:25:18.880 --> 00:25:21.360
 And again, she was from Devon and she made the whole thing up.

00:25:21.360 --> 00:25:24.400
 She was from, I looked into it, I spotted that as well today.

00:25:24.400 --> 00:25:28.640
 She was from somewhere that is a 30-minute drive from where we are right now,

00:25:28.640 --> 00:25:29.920
 a little place called Withridge.

00:25:29.920 --> 00:25:31.120
 Oh, hello.

00:25:31.120 --> 00:25:33.520
 Yeah?

00:25:33.520 --> 00:25:37.040
 But even the people of Cumbria looked out on the people of Withridge.

00:25:37.040 --> 00:25:42.240
 But it was a sort of tradition that travel-riding merged into fiction.

00:25:42.240 --> 00:25:43.040
 Yes.

00:25:43.040 --> 00:25:45.680
 From about 1600, 1900, you couldn't quite tell.

00:25:45.680 --> 00:25:46.960
 There was basically three categories.

00:25:46.960 --> 00:25:49.040
 There was Gulliver's Travel Style.

00:25:49.040 --> 00:25:50.720
 This is a fictional travel account.

00:25:50.720 --> 00:25:52.560
 And then there were proper travel journals.

00:25:52.560 --> 00:25:55.200
 And then there were loads of people who were just kind of making stuff up,

00:25:55.200 --> 00:25:56.800
 but pretending it was true.

00:25:56.800 --> 00:25:59.520
 And there was the Travels of Sir John Mandeville.

00:25:59.520 --> 00:26:01.600
 Actually, so this was much earlier,

00:26:01.600 --> 00:26:03.840
 but he was almost the precursor to all of these.

00:26:03.840 --> 00:26:06.880
 These appeared in about the 1360s.

00:26:06.880 --> 00:26:11.040
 And they were taken as legit travel books for over 300 years.

00:26:11.040 --> 00:26:14.480
 So Christopher Columbus used them as a complete reference book,

00:26:14.480 --> 00:26:16.960
 like all the great travelers of later ages did.

00:26:16.960 --> 00:26:19.040
 And they covered China, India,

00:26:19.040 --> 00:26:20.640
 present-day Indonesia.

00:26:20.640 --> 00:26:24.800
 And they told these amazing stories of like Ireland's first-hand account

00:26:24.800 --> 00:26:27.840
 of people who had the bodies of humans in the heads of dogs.

00:26:27.840 --> 00:26:33.120
 Or people whose mouths were so small that they had to suck all their food through reeds,

00:26:33.120 --> 00:26:34.720
 because they just had a tiny hole for a mouth.

00:26:34.720 --> 00:26:39.120
 And he said, "All the Mongols eat their father as soon as they die."

00:26:39.120 --> 00:26:40.480
 They went, "Okay, great."

00:26:40.480 --> 00:26:42.720
 That was the thing that Sal Manazar claimed.

00:26:42.720 --> 00:26:45.760
 He claimed that he said he was divorced

00:26:45.760 --> 00:26:48.960
 and that he was a reformed cannibal because, in Formosa,

00:26:48.960 --> 00:26:51.040
 husbands were allowed to eat their wives.

00:26:51.040 --> 00:26:54.240
 If there was adultery that had happened,

00:26:54.240 --> 00:26:55.920
 if their wives had committed adultery, you were allowed to do so.

00:26:55.920 --> 00:26:58.480
 There was always a lot of cannibalism going on in these stories

00:26:58.480 --> 00:27:01.920
 when there was like the idea of weird foreigners would eat humans.

00:27:01.920 --> 00:27:04.320
 Although the guy who yottled about John Mandeville

00:27:04.320 --> 00:27:07.760
 he found one group of people whose only source of nourishment

00:27:07.760 --> 00:27:09.200
 was the smell of apples.

00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:15.360
 And he also found that he said that in Ethiopia,

00:27:15.360 --> 00:27:17.760
 "All the people had only one foot,

00:27:17.760 --> 00:27:20.880
 but that foot was so large that it shadowed them from the sun."

00:27:20.880 --> 00:27:23.600
 "Oh, come on, how does that work?"

00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:27.120
 "They would lie on the back and hold their massive foot."

00:27:27.120 --> 00:27:28.800
 "Oh, wow!"

00:27:28.800 --> 00:27:30.480
 It was awful when they wanted to go bowling.

00:27:30.480 --> 00:27:37.120
 "That's pretty cool. We should evolve like that."

00:27:37.120 --> 00:27:38.800
 This is a slightly off topic,

00:27:38.800 --> 00:27:41.760
 but PL Travers, the writer of Mary Poppins,

00:27:41.760 --> 00:27:43.520
 she was into one massive foot.

00:27:44.720 --> 00:27:46.560
 She was into a lot of esoteric stuff,

00:27:46.560 --> 00:27:50.000
 and she went on a trip at one point with a spiritual guru

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:52.560
 who she looked up to where they were searching the earth

00:27:52.560 --> 00:27:56.080
 for a giant footprint that was said to be made

00:27:56.080 --> 00:28:00.640
 by an intergalactic giant who used earth as a stepping stone

00:28:00.640 --> 00:28:02.560
 as he was hopping through the universe.

00:28:02.560 --> 00:28:04.640
 And she was convinced there was a giant footprint

00:28:04.640 --> 00:28:07.680
 that would be a rather necromanic, I don't know if that's true.

00:28:07.680 --> 00:28:09.040
 Sorry, where was she writing?

00:28:09.040 --> 00:28:10.400
 Well, 30s, 40s, 50s?

00:28:10.400 --> 00:28:13.040
 Yeah, but she was part of a very big spiritual,

00:28:13.040 --> 00:28:15.360
 very lobsome, uh, rampant kind of movement.

00:28:15.360 --> 00:28:16.640
 Can you believe it? Any shit, didn't they?

00:28:16.640 --> 00:28:17.920
 Until almost now.

00:28:17.920 --> 00:28:20.960
 Yeah, you're right. Everyone's making really

00:28:20.960 --> 00:28:22.960
 fact-based sensual decisions these days.

00:28:22.960 --> 00:28:25.760
 Thank God we've come so far.

00:28:25.760 --> 00:28:28.320
 It's time for our final fact of the show,

00:28:28.320 --> 00:28:29.680
 and that is my fact.

00:28:29.680 --> 00:28:31.360
 My fact this week is that,

00:28:31.360 --> 00:28:33.120
 ahead of breeding season,

00:28:33.120 --> 00:28:35.760
 Iceland publishes an illustrated catalogue

00:28:35.760 --> 00:28:37.920
 of the country's most eligible sheep.

00:28:41.200 --> 00:28:42.800
 Yeah, so this is called the RAM Registry.

00:28:42.800 --> 00:28:44.560
 It's an annual catalogue that they make available.

00:28:44.560 --> 00:28:47.280
 It starts online then they do a physical publication.

00:28:47.280 --> 00:28:51.360
 And it um, it profiles in this, in the last year that's gone,

00:28:51.360 --> 00:28:52.640
 44 RAMs.

00:28:52.640 --> 00:28:54.160
 They do color photos.

00:28:54.160 --> 00:28:55.680
 They do pedigrees breeding.

00:28:55.680 --> 00:28:56.640
 It's all these stats.

00:28:56.640 --> 00:28:58.560
 It tells you everything you need to know.

00:28:58.560 --> 00:29:01.840
 Um, it's a 52 page catalogue.

00:29:01.840 --> 00:29:05.600
 They have an obituary section for RAMs that have passed away.

00:29:05.600 --> 00:29:08.080
 I think if Tinder had an obituary section,

00:29:08.080 --> 00:29:09.440
 it would be more interesting.

00:29:09.440 --> 00:29:13.600
 Yeah, that's true, but it has stuff like how many,

00:29:13.600 --> 00:29:15.680
 how many they're expected to sigh or it's just,

00:29:15.680 --> 00:29:17.840
 it's the ultimate guide that you need

00:29:17.840 --> 00:29:19.680
 for when it's breeding season you want.

00:29:19.680 --> 00:29:21.360
 I want that and that's how they,

00:29:21.360 --> 00:29:22.720
 that's how they spend their money.

00:29:22.720 --> 00:29:23.920
 This thing is 20 years old.

00:29:23.920 --> 00:29:26.080
 This Registry is well established.

00:29:26.080 --> 00:29:28.560
 There's a RAM in this year's called Strumper.

00:29:28.560 --> 00:29:32.240
 And Strumper, they say, the farmer who owns him,

00:29:32.240 --> 00:29:34.960
 says Strumper, he is aware of his environment

00:29:34.960 --> 00:29:37.120
 and knows exactly what's expected of him.

00:29:37.120 --> 00:29:40.000
 Oh, he doesn't call himself a Strumper.

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:42.000
 He calls himself an exotic dancer.

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:47.200
 But they get, they get graded for leadership as well.

00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:50.960
 So there are these, there are these sheep which are called flock leaders

00:29:50.960 --> 00:29:54.240
 and they automatically act as leaders to the rest of the flock.

00:29:54.240 --> 00:29:57.120
 And they, that's very important because they go off into the mountains

00:29:57.120 --> 00:30:00.080
 and you need a, uh, RAM in charge,

00:30:00.080 --> 00:30:03.120
 who sort of, um, you know, when the weather's going to be bad,

00:30:03.120 --> 00:30:04.880
 when they can force all the weather.

00:30:04.880 --> 00:30:06.160
 So when they think the weather's going to be bad,

00:30:06.160 --> 00:30:08.720
 they lead the flock to shelter and safety.

00:30:08.720 --> 00:30:09.520
 Wow.

00:30:09.520 --> 00:30:12.560
 And the sheep which are particularly intelligent subbreed

00:30:12.560 --> 00:30:14.160
 are called Icelandic leader sheep.

00:30:14.160 --> 00:30:16.560
 Because they show leadership.

00:30:16.560 --> 00:30:21.200
 Oh, I don't think that's why, but it's a very nice coincidence.

00:30:21.200 --> 00:30:25.120
 And then, but the thing is, on like day snaps,

00:30:25.120 --> 00:30:28.400
 they never get to meet the lady, um, sheep today,

00:30:28.400 --> 00:30:31.520
 because basically it's a sperm donor kind of thing.

00:30:31.520 --> 00:30:34.560
 So even when they're swipes on, they're just like,

00:30:34.560 --> 00:30:36.320
 I know, all you're going to get is my sperm.

00:30:36.320 --> 00:30:38.480
 Oh my god. Thank God Tinder doesn't run like that.

00:30:38.480 --> 00:30:41.840
 I've never used Tinder, but, uh, is that not how it works?

00:30:41.840 --> 00:30:44.640
 I used to, but I'd never just pop my sperm in the purse.

00:30:44.640 --> 00:30:45.600
 This isn't the purse anyway.

00:30:45.600 --> 00:30:47.520
 Swipe to ride on me.

00:30:47.520 --> 00:30:49.760
 I think that might be a relief for a lot of women on Tinder.

00:30:49.760 --> 00:30:55.360
 Thank God a cup of sperm doesn't text me with a lot of stamps.

00:30:55.360 --> 00:30:56.240
 I'm ready.

00:30:56.240 --> 00:30:58.960
 First class male.

00:30:58.960 --> 00:31:02.720
 Wait, is that first class male?

00:31:02.720 --> 00:31:03.840
 Both ways round.

00:31:03.840 --> 00:31:06.800
 But they're into sheep.

00:31:06.800 --> 00:31:07.920
 Are they in Iceland?

00:31:07.920 --> 00:31:08.880
 Oh, yeah, yeah.

00:31:08.880 --> 00:31:10.640
 Have three times as many sheep as people,

00:31:10.640 --> 00:31:14.800
 and they have this amazing ceremony every, every winter.

00:31:14.800 --> 00:31:17.440
 So basically the sheep in Iceland, they have this weird farming system

00:31:17.440 --> 00:31:19.920
 where all different farmers, different herds of sheep

00:31:19.920 --> 00:31:22.560
 are free to roam with each other up on the mountains.

00:31:22.560 --> 00:31:24.960
 So they're all intermingle, which is a massive hassle

00:31:24.960 --> 00:31:27.360
 when it comes to bringing them back down to put them in your pen,

00:31:27.360 --> 00:31:28.720
 because they're all mixed up.

00:31:28.720 --> 00:31:30.480
 And so they just recruit everyone.

00:31:30.480 --> 00:31:33.760
 So if you're a tourist in Iceland at, you know, pen time,

00:31:33.760 --> 00:31:36.880
 and it's got a name, I think it's called Retire Time,

00:31:36.880 --> 00:31:39.920
 and then you go and you help round up sheep,

00:31:39.920 --> 00:31:41.920
 and you have to shimmy them down the mountain.

00:31:41.920 --> 00:31:43.920
 And you put them into this big enclosure

00:31:43.920 --> 00:31:45.680
 with a central bit in the middle.

00:31:45.680 --> 00:31:48.720
 And then you, they've got little marks on their ears

00:31:48.720 --> 00:31:49.920
 that show which farmer they belong to.

00:31:49.920 --> 00:31:52.160
 And if you see them, aren't you, grab it by the ear

00:31:52.160 --> 00:31:53.360
 or by the scratch of its neck?

00:31:53.360 --> 00:31:55.840
 You lift it up and you chuck it into the bit of that enclosure.

00:31:55.840 --> 00:31:57.040
 Did he lift it up? The chuck it?

00:31:57.040 --> 00:31:58.080
 Did you lift it up and throw it?

00:31:58.080 --> 00:31:59.440
 That was very strong.

00:31:59.440 --> 00:32:00.720
 All right.

00:32:00.720 --> 00:32:04.560
 The sheep are really, they're really perfect in Iceland, aren't they?

00:32:04.560 --> 00:32:06.560
 They don't have any kind of other genes.

00:32:06.560 --> 00:32:08.880
 They're like, they've been there since the Vikings

00:32:08.880 --> 00:32:09.840
 and they've never had--

00:32:09.840 --> 00:32:11.520
 All right, captain Aryan over there.

00:32:11.520 --> 00:32:15.840
 No one's sullied these genes.

00:32:15.840 --> 00:32:18.160
 Well, this is what they think.

00:32:18.160 --> 00:32:20.560
 They think that because they've been there for the whole time,

00:32:20.560 --> 00:32:22.400
 they're not sullied by any other blood.

00:32:22.400 --> 00:32:28.000
 And in 1878, they imported a single English ram into Iceland,

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:31.360
 and they had to kill 60% of Icelandic flocks

00:32:31.360 --> 00:32:35.120
 because they spread disease and parasites to the flocks.

00:32:35.120 --> 00:32:36.640
 English tourists are best in the world.

00:32:36.640 --> 00:32:40.960
 They love eating the sheep as well,

00:32:40.960 --> 00:32:43.360
 as well, obviously, because, you know, sheep are eaten.

00:32:43.360 --> 00:32:47.840
 But there's a thing called swith, which is half a sheep's head.

00:32:47.840 --> 00:32:48.800
 That's a delicacy.

00:32:48.800 --> 00:32:52.720
 And they make sour testicles and brain jam.

00:32:52.720 --> 00:32:57.280
 Well, they-- so I found out the best way to eat the boiled sheep's brain,

00:32:57.280 --> 00:32:59.760
 which is something that is a real delicacy.

00:32:59.760 --> 00:33:01.440
 And this is because there's an MP.

00:33:01.440 --> 00:33:03.120
 I think he might have been the foreign minister

00:33:03.120 --> 00:33:04.560
 or the homosexual or something.

00:33:04.560 --> 00:33:07.600
 He's a guy called, uh, why didn't I practice this name

00:33:07.600 --> 00:33:08.960
 before I came on stage.

00:33:08.960 --> 00:33:11.680
 He's called Osso Scalfeoyonton.

00:33:11.680 --> 00:33:14.000
 Osso Scalfeoyonton.

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:15.360
 Well, I think he's safely anonymous.

00:33:15.360 --> 00:33:16.160
 That's the main thing.

00:33:16.160 --> 00:33:18.640
 He's not sat at home going,

00:33:18.640 --> 00:33:20.240
 why are they talking about me, is he?

00:33:20.240 --> 00:33:21.520
 No, he's not.

00:33:21.520 --> 00:33:23.280
 Wouldn't it be that guy who would react?

00:33:23.280 --> 00:33:25.760
 But he was in 2013.

00:33:25.760 --> 00:33:27.680
 He was serving some sheep's brain at a party.

00:33:27.680 --> 00:33:31.040
 And he said, "This is amongst the best boiled sheep said I've ever had.

00:33:31.040 --> 00:33:33.520
 They stuck to my gum as proper heads should."

00:33:33.520 --> 00:33:35.120
 So that's what I was supposed to do.

00:33:35.120 --> 00:33:36.160
 They stick to the gum.

00:33:36.160 --> 00:33:37.760
 And then he was asked really if it wasn't the best.

00:33:37.760 --> 00:33:40.000
 And he was like, "Okay, look, it wasn't the very best.

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:41.600
 The head should have been more fermented."

00:33:41.600 --> 00:33:43.200
 Because we, from the West Fjords,

00:33:43.200 --> 00:33:45.200
 prefer our sheep's head so fermented

00:33:45.200 --> 00:33:47.440
 that we can drink the eye out of the eye socket.

00:33:47.440 --> 00:33:51.600
 So that's what you're going for.

00:33:51.600 --> 00:33:52.640
 Wow, goodness.

00:33:52.640 --> 00:33:55.440
 In 2018, two men in Iceland summoned the police

00:33:55.440 --> 00:33:58.320
 and the coast guard after they'd seen a polar bear

00:33:58.320 --> 00:33:59.360
 on a peninsula.

00:33:59.360 --> 00:34:00.800
 And that's obviously incredibly dangerous

00:34:00.800 --> 00:34:01.920
 because they really don't come near.

00:34:01.920 --> 00:34:03.120
 He was very often.

00:34:03.120 --> 00:34:05.120
 Eventually, after a lengthy search,

00:34:05.120 --> 00:34:07.200
 the search was called off and the man admitted,

00:34:07.200 --> 00:34:08.960
 it may just have been a large sheep.

00:34:08.960 --> 00:34:16.240
 It's just a lot closer than they thought.

00:34:16.240 --> 00:34:17.520
 It's understandable.

00:34:17.520 --> 00:34:22.800
 I know how to artificially inseminate a cow

00:34:22.800 --> 00:34:24.560
 based on researching for this podcast.

00:34:24.560 --> 00:34:25.280
 Cool.

00:34:25.280 --> 00:34:28.720
 So this is obviously about pairing sheep up with each other

00:34:28.720 --> 00:34:30.080
 so they can mate properly.

00:34:30.080 --> 00:34:31.840
 And dairy cows, you do the same thing.

00:34:31.840 --> 00:34:35.440
 So I think 75% of dairy cows in this country

00:34:35.440 --> 00:34:37.760
 when they have to be inseminated, they get inseminated,

00:34:37.760 --> 00:34:40.720
 but just by semen rather than the actual bull.

00:34:40.720 --> 00:34:42.320
 And for some reason, I found myself reading

00:34:42.320 --> 00:34:45.040
 this really in-depth farmer's guide to how to do it.

00:34:45.040 --> 00:34:46.320
 And what I didn't realise was,

00:34:46.320 --> 00:34:50.320
 so you get a semen gun, which you put the semen in.

00:34:50.320 --> 00:34:51.680
 [LAUGHTER]

00:34:51.680 --> 00:34:53.840
 Did you bring your semen gun to a gun fight?

00:34:53.840 --> 00:34:55.120
 No.

00:34:55.120 --> 00:34:57.120
 [LAUGHTER]

00:34:57.120 --> 00:34:59.280
 Amit.

00:34:59.280 --> 00:35:01.600
 You bring your semen gun to the insemination fight.

00:35:01.600 --> 00:35:04.640
 And, but what you do is, you have to--

00:35:04.640 --> 00:35:07.840
 so there are two entries into a cow.

00:35:07.840 --> 00:35:09.600
 So as much of the humans--

00:35:09.600 --> 00:35:10.720
 Yeah.

00:35:10.720 --> 00:35:12.000
 You've got the--

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:13.520
 Oh, sorry.

00:35:13.520 --> 00:35:14.520
 There are three.

00:35:14.520 --> 00:35:16.400
 Oh, sorry, there are three.

00:35:16.400 --> 00:35:19.920
 Where are you, Devin?

00:35:19.920 --> 00:35:22.480
 Something tells me, you are not the biggest expert

00:35:22.480 --> 00:35:24.240
 in this room.

00:35:24.240 --> 00:35:28.320
 Are there a number of ways into a cow?

00:35:28.320 --> 00:35:30.640
 I know that people have never know all these secret ways,

00:35:30.640 --> 00:35:37.400
 but there are two entries into the back of a cow, officially.

00:35:37.400 --> 00:35:41.120
 And so one is the rectum, as we all have.

00:35:41.120 --> 00:35:42.040
 It's one professor.

00:35:42.040 --> 00:35:43.160
 Let me write this down.

00:35:43.160 --> 00:35:49.840
 Children, what do you be quiet?

00:35:49.840 --> 00:35:52.400
 You've got the rectum, and then you've got the sex tubes

00:35:52.400 --> 00:35:55.680
 and they're different.

00:35:55.680 --> 00:35:58.280
 All right, the cervix.

00:35:58.280 --> 00:36:01.040
 But what you do is, amazingly, when you're inseminating a cow,

00:36:01.040 --> 00:36:03.440
 you obviously have to stick the gun in the cervix.

00:36:03.440 --> 00:36:09.320
 But the way you navigate the gun into the uterine horns,

00:36:09.320 --> 00:36:12.720
 as they're called, is you have to put your other arm

00:36:12.720 --> 00:36:14.960
 that's not holding the gun into the rectum.

00:36:14.960 --> 00:36:17.680
 [LAUGHTER]

00:36:17.680 --> 00:36:19.840
 So it's so amazing.

00:36:19.840 --> 00:36:23.920
 And they say, shove your arm into the rectum.

00:36:23.920 --> 00:36:27.160
 Get someone else to hold the cow's tail aside while you do this.

00:36:27.160 --> 00:36:30.160
 You have to be a bald farmer who tried using one foot.

00:36:30.160 --> 00:36:31.400
 [LAUGHTER]

00:36:31.400 --> 00:36:32.640
 In the cow's tail.

00:36:32.640 --> 00:36:35.480
 [LAUGHTER]

00:36:35.480 --> 00:36:37.720
 This is the worst game of twist around ever played.

00:36:37.720 --> 00:36:42.360
 [LAUGHTER]

00:36:42.360 --> 00:36:45.720
 It says left hand, sex tubes.

00:36:45.720 --> 00:36:49.760
 Anyway, look, it just feels like this lesson isn't going to end.

00:36:49.760 --> 00:36:53.280
 So you essentially use your rectum arm

00:36:53.280 --> 00:36:58.520
 to navigate your semen gun, which is in the vaginal canal.

00:36:58.520 --> 00:36:59.760
 And you push it through.

00:36:59.760 --> 00:37:02.240
 So you've got your arm in the rectum,

00:37:02.240 --> 00:37:04.600
 and it's pushing against the other canal

00:37:04.600 --> 00:37:06.040
 so that it gets into the uterus.

00:37:06.040 --> 00:37:08.880
 And it's called recto vaginal insemination.

00:37:08.880 --> 00:37:10.680
 And that's lesson over.

00:37:10.680 --> 00:37:11.480
 Enjoy.

00:37:11.480 --> 00:37:14.240
 [APPLAUSE]

00:37:14.240 --> 00:37:16.680
 OK, that is it.

00:37:16.680 --> 00:37:19.880
 That is all of our facts.

00:37:19.880 --> 00:37:21.640
 Thank you so much for listening.

00:37:21.640 --> 00:37:23.960
 If you'd like to get in contact with any of us

00:37:23.960 --> 00:37:25.920
 and how the things that we have said over the course

00:37:25.920 --> 00:37:28.800
 of this podcast, please don't sound.

00:37:28.800 --> 00:37:31.960
 [LAUGHTER]

00:37:31.960 --> 00:37:34.160
 But if you insist, I'm on that tribal land.

00:37:34.160 --> 00:37:34.680
 Andy.

00:37:34.680 --> 00:37:35.720
 I'm Drew Hunterib.

00:37:35.720 --> 00:37:36.240
 James.

00:37:36.240 --> 00:37:37.260
 Hi, James Harkin.

00:37:37.260 --> 00:37:40.360
 And Chazinski.

00:37:40.360 --> 00:37:43.800
 Your authorities should email.

00:37:43.800 --> 00:37:46.600
 You can email podcasts at qi.com.

00:37:46.600 --> 00:37:48.280
 Or you can go to our group account, which

00:37:48.280 --> 00:37:49.840
 is at no such thing, or our website.

00:37:49.840 --> 00:37:51.640
 No such thing is a fish.com.

00:37:51.640 --> 00:37:53.320
 We have all of our previous episodes up there.

00:37:53.320 --> 00:37:55.280
 We have links to our upcoming tours.

00:37:55.280 --> 00:38:00.080
 We have YouTube videos of Anna showing how to inseminate.

00:38:00.080 --> 00:38:01.240
 Thank you so much.

00:38:01.240 --> 00:38:02.240
 Good night.

00:38:02.240 --> 00:38:04.840

00:38:04.840 --> 00:38:08.200
