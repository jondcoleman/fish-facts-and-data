00:00:00,00:00:03,"Hi everyone, before we start this week's show, which was recorded live in"
00:00:03,00:00:07,"Ofkham, we want to let you know how you can come to one of our live events."
00:00:07,00:00:12,"Yes, we have a website. It has all of the places that we're going to be in the upcoming months."
00:00:12,00:00:17,Some of them will be in the UK and Ireland for the rest of you living in Europe.
00:00:17,00:00:20,"We are going to Gothenburg, Stockholm, Oslo, Amsterdam,"
00:00:20,00:00:24,"Grenigan, Geneva, Copenhagen and Antwerp and this is very exciting."
00:00:24,00:00:27,"We just announced two more dates. Can you guess where they are, Dan?"
00:00:27,00:00:30,"You know where they are. Yes, I know."
00:00:30,00:00:33,That was me trying to fake not knowing. It's Paris and Berlin.
00:00:33,00:00:35,"Paris and Berlin, wow."
00:00:35,00:00:38,"Yeah, we're so excited. Those tickets are going to go on sale this Friday."
00:00:38,00:00:41,You can go to know such thing as a fish.com.
00:00:41,00:00:46,We have a link to the British Irish and then all of these amazing European dates going as well.
00:00:46,00:00:49,"Do go for the Europeans as quick as you can, by the way, if you're living there"
00:00:49,00:00:53,because they are going quick. We expect Paris and Berlin will sell out in minutes.
00:00:54,00:00:58,"It's my prediction. Well, let's see if that prediction comes true, Daniel."
00:00:58,00:01:00,"But no matter what, we hope to see you there."
00:01:00,00:01:04,"Anyway, hope you enjoy this week's show. Again, recorded live in Ofkham."
00:01:04,00:01:08,"Okay, on with the show. On with the podcast."
00:01:08,00:01:23,"Hello and welcome to another episode of no such thing as a fish,"
00:01:23,00:01:26,a weekly podcast this week coming to you from Ofkham.
00:01:26,00:01:35,"My name is James Shriver and I am sitting here with Enich Zinsky,"
00:01:35,00:01:38,"Andrew Huntson, Marie, and James Harkin."
00:01:38,00:01:42,"And once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts"
00:01:42,00:01:45,"from the last seven days. And in no particular order,"
00:01:45,00:01:49,"here we go, starting with you, James."
00:01:49,00:01:53,"Okay, my fact this week is that there is a man in the poll who can lick his own"
00:01:53,00:02:00,forehead. And the reason I'm laughing to myself is because I know what he looks like.
00:02:00,00:02:05,"So if you're at home listening to this, then do Google it."
00:02:05,00:02:09,"And if you're in Ofkham, sat in front of us, then here's what he looks like."
00:02:09,00:02:17,We told you at home it was worth googling.
00:02:19,00:02:23,It's so amazing. What's so bizarre about him is that when you hear he can look his own
00:02:23,00:02:26,"forehead, you immediately think, ""Oh my god, he makes his tongue really long."""
00:02:26,00:02:29,"And little do you know, he makes his face really tiny."
00:02:29,00:02:33,He's a little bit of both because he does have a really long tongue.
00:02:33,00:02:37,"You can sometimes see pictures where he sticks out. It's really, really long."
00:02:37,00:02:41,"He's basically, he's a 35-year-old bus driver from Urla Barri in the poll."
00:02:41,00:02:45,And he says that he tries not to do this too often because he scares the children.
00:02:46,00:02:49,"Well, he says he's not been allowed to do it at work when he's on the bus."
00:02:49,00:02:53,"He says that A, the children get scared. And then with, he talks about adults."
00:02:53,00:02:58,"He says, ""Even adults can lose consciousness when they watch me in action."""
00:02:58,00:03:03,But can you guys lick your nose with your tongue?
00:03:03,00:03:06,"No. It's quite rare, isn't it? Oh, wow."
00:03:06,00:03:14,"Again, oh, just Google pictures of people licking their tongue and you'll see what that is."
00:03:14,00:03:18,"I didn't realise it had a name, so 10% of people can do it, including me."
00:03:18,00:03:24,It's called the Gaulin sign. Didn't know how to medical term.
00:03:24,00:03:27,And you've tried doing the full forehead.
00:03:27,00:03:30,I think I have to work up to that.
00:03:30,00:03:36,"It's really interesting, though, because this guy is kind of gurning."
00:03:36,00:03:40,Are we saying it's gurning the sport where you scrunch your face into an amazing shape
00:03:40,00:03:42,and you surprise people and win awards?
00:03:42,00:03:43,"You know, gurning the sport."
00:03:43,00:03:46,"Gurning, yeah. The Olympic sport of gurning, yeah."
00:03:46,00:03:53,"So the British and world obviously gurning championships, because no-one else does it."
00:03:53,00:03:58,"Makeup is banned, but manipulation of false teeth if you have them is permitted."
00:03:58,00:04:02,And it really helps if you don't have many teeth.
00:04:02,00:04:05,"So this guy in Nepal has only one tooth, I believe."
00:04:05,00:04:06,"Oh, I see."
00:04:06,00:04:07,You're okay.
00:04:07,00:04:08,"Oh, yeah."
00:04:08,00:04:14,"Okay. Yeah. And there's a gurning world champion called Peter Jackman, not to be confused with Peter Jackson,"
00:04:14,00:04:19,who he's won the championships four times and he had all of his teeth removed so that he could
00:04:19,00:04:21,"improve his technique. Wow, really. Yeah."
00:04:21,00:04:22,Really?
00:04:22,00:04:23,Yeah.
00:04:23,00:04:28,"There's an organisers that said age definitely helps in the competition, because your skin is much"
00:04:28,00:04:33,"looser when you, when you age, it allows you to manipulate and crease up in ways."
00:04:33,00:04:35,So you have an advantage if you're older.
00:04:35,00:04:39,"And I should say this world championship or British championship for the whole world,"
00:04:39,00:04:40,but only British people take part.
00:04:40,00:04:44,"And in fact, only people from Cumbria take part."
00:04:44,00:04:49,Even the people of Devon look down on the voucher voucher.
00:04:49,00:04:53,"You know, in 2014 the two runners up were both Swedish."
00:04:53,00:04:56,"Oh, no, I didn't know that."
00:04:56,00:04:59,But it takes place in the Egremont Crab Fair.
00:04:59,00:05:03,And they say it's been happening since 1267.
00:05:04,00:05:08,"At the fair, it seems might have been happening since then on and off, because we know that"
00:05:08,00:05:11,King Henry III granted a royal charter for a fair.
00:05:11,00:05:14,We think probably the gurning hasn't taken part for all that time.
00:05:14,00:05:19,Although there is a newspaper article in 1852 that says it's an ancient practice.
00:05:19,00:05:21,So it has definitely been going on for a long time.
00:05:21,00:05:23,Yeah.
00:05:23,00:05:27,Yeah. I was reading an obituary of a guy called Lenny Wells.
00:05:27,00:05:28,This is an obituary in the Guardian.
00:05:28,00:05:30,And he died in the year 2000.
00:05:30,00:05:34,And he was known for gurning in various TV adverts who is very good at gurning.
00:05:34,00:05:39,"It said, although he was also a keen rugby fan and devoted family man,"
00:05:39,00:05:43,it is for the unique rubberiness of his lips and cheeks that he will be most fondly remembered.
00:05:43,00:05:50,"That was one, that was the interview people who had taken part in contest with him."
00:05:50,00:05:54,"And one of the guys said, this one time Gordon Blacklock, another competitor,"
00:05:54,00:05:56,"I'm sure you've heard of, another gurna."
00:05:57,00:06:02,"Gordon Blacklock was at head on points, but Lenny stepped up and pulled a face like a rhino's anus."
00:06:02,00:06:03,I'm telling you.
00:06:03,00:06:10,Is that a technical term?
00:06:10,00:06:13,I'm telling you the audience went bizarre.
00:06:13,00:06:14,"Oh, no, no."
00:06:14,00:06:17,I love to hear the commentators.
00:06:17,00:06:20,"I'm like, can I just come on up the back like a rhino's anus is?"
00:06:20,00:06:26,"There was, in fact, I think the greatest champion of all time is Anne Woods,"
00:06:26,00:06:29,"who was one of the woman's gurning title, 28 times."
00:06:29,00:06:32,That's 28 years of gurning.
00:06:32,00:06:36,"She missed one crab fur when she was expecting a baby,"
00:06:36,00:06:39,and it probably pulling a lot of faces then as well.
00:06:39,00:06:45,"And in 2010, she collapsed after four minutes of intensive gurning,"
00:06:45,00:06:47,and had to be rushed to hospital.
00:06:47,00:06:49,So there are injuries that happened in the sport.
00:06:49,00:06:52,And actually Anne Woods died quite recently as well.
00:06:52,00:06:55,"She died in 2015, and I read her obituary,"
00:06:55,00:06:58,and it said that she always entered the gurning arena
00:06:58,00:07:00,"to the tune of ""You're gorgeous"" by Baby Bird."
00:07:00,00:07:05,"For reeners, like how many people are going to watch this thing?"
00:07:05,00:07:09,"We mentioned before Mr. Rugley from Zimbabwe,"
00:07:09,00:07:11,"so there's an annual Mr. Rugley competition in Zimbabwe,"
00:07:11,00:07:13,which is very similar to the gurning.
00:07:13,00:07:16,"And in 2015, there was a huge controversy,"
00:07:16,00:07:21,"because the guy who won it, the runner-up, who was a previous winner"
00:07:21,00:07:22,"and had been thinking he would win it again,"
00:07:22,00:07:24,the runner-up said it's not fair.
00:07:24,00:07:27,"His argument is based on the fact that he's got a lot of teeth missing,"
00:07:27,00:07:28,whereas my argument is natural.
00:07:28,00:07:32,"And the winners said, you know, ""Suck it up."""
00:07:32,00:07:35,"He said, ""They should just accept. I'm uglier than them."""
00:07:35,00:07:37,He can only suck it up if he's no teeth.
00:07:37,00:07:41,Get your teeth removed. Have some commitment.
00:07:41,00:07:43,"Like, you know, a aforementioned champion."
00:07:43,00:07:45,Get them out.
00:07:45,00:07:48,"On tongs, because this guy can lick his own forehead."
00:07:48,00:07:52,"There's some new research has found that weightlifters have stronger tongs,"
00:07:52,00:07:55,and runners have better tong endurance than normal people.
00:07:55,00:07:57,This is not amazing.
00:07:57,00:08:01,I've actually never watched the weightlifting.
00:08:01,00:08:04,"Do they have a little tiny, a little weight lily for their tongs?"
00:08:04,00:08:06,"Well, they're doing the big ones with their arms."
00:08:06,00:08:09,What they thought is perhaps it's because you're working out more.
00:08:09,00:08:11,All of your muscles are stronger.
00:08:11,00:08:14,"But actually, having good tong muscles is really important,"
00:08:14,00:08:16,because it keeps your airways open.
00:08:16,00:08:19,"So if your tong is stronger, then it means it keeps your airways open,"
00:08:19,00:08:21,"and maybe it's better for running,"
00:08:21,00:08:23,"better for keeping more oxygen in your bodies, stuff like that."
00:08:23,00:08:28,"I think it's a very specific thing, the way you pronounce tongue from your part of the world."
00:08:28,00:08:30,"And it just takes so long to get over the fact that it's tong,"
00:08:30,00:08:33,"and you're just thinking, ""What, my fire tongs are perfectly strong."""
00:08:33,00:08:36,Do you generally own fire tongs?
00:08:36,00:08:38,"Of course, I don't have a fire."
00:08:38,00:08:41,I just jab the radiator with them sometimes.
00:08:41,00:08:47,Draffs have good tongs.
00:08:47,00:08:53,Really good tongs. They're tongs are half a meter long and at least half a meter.
00:08:53,00:08:55,So that's longer than my forearm?
00:08:55,00:08:56,"Wow, how much do we see?"
00:08:56,00:08:58,Is that outside or is that...
00:08:58,00:09:01,"No, no, it's not outside, so quite a lot of it goes back into them, I think."
00:09:01,00:09:02,"But you know, there's just a man outside."
00:09:02,00:09:05,"If you've seen a giraffe, you know, lick a leaf off a tree."
00:09:05,00:09:08,Can they lick the ears?
00:09:08,00:09:09,"Yes, they can lick the ears. That's right."
00:09:09,00:09:12,"Yes, and they're also black or purple their tongs,"
00:09:12,00:09:16,and they think that's because they spend 12 hours a day with their tongs out.
00:09:16,00:09:19,And they would be sunburnt on them if they didn't have sun protection.
00:09:19,00:09:21,"So that's why they have black tongs, don't have tongs."
00:09:21,00:09:24,I'm just really self-conscious about saying that word now.
00:09:24,00:09:32,"There was a doctor in the, I think, the 19th century."
00:09:32,00:09:34,There was a big debate over how you could prove that someone had died.
00:09:34,00:09:38,"And there was a, I think he was French, doctor called Labaud."
00:09:38,00:09:42,And he said that you can save people who only appear to be dead.
00:09:42,00:09:45,"You know, they fall into a swoon or they might be unconscious,"
00:09:45,00:09:46,but they are revivable.
00:09:46,00:09:49,And he said the way to do it is to pull their tong
00:09:49,00:09:51,rhythmically for three hours.
00:09:51,00:09:57,He could do that for two hours and 59 minutes and then he got...
00:09:57,00:10:03,"He swore, he swore that he'd done this."
00:10:03,00:10:04,He said he'd saved people doing it.
00:10:04,00:10:08,He said he'd saved an unconscious cow and a bulldog that had swooned.
00:10:08,00:10:12,"And he invented a tongue-pulling machine which was, you know,"
00:10:12,00:10:16,which pull the machine. And there was an assistant whose job was to turn the crank and pull the
00:10:16,00:10:17,tongue-pulling machine out. Oh my god.
00:10:17,00:10:22,I know. So he resigned because he was bored and he was replaced with an electric tongue-pulling machine.
00:10:22,00:10:23,So... Wow.
00:10:23,00:10:28,"There's a hockey player called Brad, an ice hockey player called Brad Marchand."
00:10:28,00:10:31,And he has been ordered to stop licking his opponents.
00:10:31,00:10:39,"He's done this more than once, but the most recent person he licked was opposition player Ryan"
00:10:39,00:10:45,Callahan. And Marchand has been described in his official biography as the little ball of hate.
00:10:45,00:10:48,So... sort of the liquor overlicky.
00:10:48,00:10:53,That's the liquor who was that. And basically it's his job to kind of start fights and stuff like
00:10:53,00:10:58,that happens in hockey. But the guy who he licked said I don't know what the difference is between
00:10:58,00:11:01,"spitting in someone's face and licking it, which is quite a good point, I think."
00:11:01,00:11:05,"And then the person who did the licking said, well, he punched me four times in the face."
00:11:05,00:11:10,[laughter]
00:11:10,00:11:12,This is a certain half a dozen isn't it?
00:11:12,00:11:13,[laughter]
00:11:13,00:11:17,Do you know how you start your tongue out when you concentrate or you may have done as a child?
00:11:17,00:11:18,"Some people do, yeah."
00:11:18,00:11:20,I definitely did. And it's much more common in children.
00:11:20,00:11:26,And I was reading a article by a neurologist who said he thinks he knows why we do this.
00:11:26,00:11:30,"And it's partly because if you're really concentrating, number one is because it stops the distraction"
00:11:30,00:11:34,"of taste or texture within your mouth. So if you just hang your tongue out, I guess it's not really"
00:11:34,00:11:38,"touching anything. It's not tasty or touching anything. But number two, he said it's because"
00:11:38,00:11:43,breastfeeding babies stick their tongue out to push their mothers nipple away when they're full.
00:11:43,00:11:47,And so that's what we're doing when we're concentrating. We're saying leave me alone.
00:11:47,00:11:49,I've got stuff to be getting along with now.
00:11:49,00:11:51,[laughter]
00:11:51,00:11:55,"I'll be honest, next time I stick my tongue out, I won't be able to concentrate quite as much"
00:11:55,00:11:59,as I could before. [laughter]
00:11:59,00:12:03,"Okay, it is time for fact number two and that is Andy."
00:12:03,00:12:08,"My fact is that in 1903, you could buy a gramophone record made of chocolate,"
00:12:08,00:12:11,which you could play a song on and then eat the disc.
00:12:11,00:12:15,And somehow we have lost this technology.
00:12:15,00:12:16,[laughter]
00:12:16,00:12:19,"But I think the technology was never great to start with, was it?"
00:12:19,00:12:23,You could play a song on a piece of chocolate. That was just what it was.
00:12:23,00:12:26,"You could play a couple of times. I mean, there were great turntables either."
00:12:26,00:12:30,"The design of the chocolate records. But so it was, this was made by a company called"
00:12:30,00:12:35,the Stolverk Chocolate Company and there were tiny turntables and small chocolate records.
00:12:35,00:12:37,It was for children basically. It was a children's toy.
00:12:37,00:12:41,"And you could play the song in a couple of times and then when you got bored, you could just eat the song."
00:12:41,00:12:44,"And I think did they put foil on the chocolate, didn't they?"
00:12:44,00:12:48,And it was the foil that they put the ridges in which acted like the record.
00:12:48,00:12:52,And then you could peel it because you don't want to be degrading your chocolate as you play a record.
00:12:52,00:12:55,"No, quite. And you say that it was a children's toy."
00:12:55,00:12:58,It was advertised in the French magazine Lanature.
00:12:58,00:13:01,"And it specifically said, ""This is not a toy."""
00:13:01,00:13:04,What kind of miserable person do you have to be?
00:13:04,00:13:07,We'll send you a chocolate gramophone record. It's not a toy.
00:13:07,00:13:11,Did it take off? No.
00:13:11,00:13:15,"She probably, you don't have any chocolate records."
00:13:15,00:13:19,Did you think you were the only one in the world who hadn't picked up on this technology?
00:13:19,00:13:22,It's got a massive hot chocolate record collection.
00:13:22,00:13:24,"I'm from Australia, maybe it hasn't reached yet."
00:13:24,00:13:31,"Maybe we're getting it next year. But sometimes in the annals of history, you can have 50 years of chocolate records."
00:13:31,00:13:34,The Beatles were released on chocolate and then it goes.
00:13:34,00:13:37,I think it might have been a limited edition thing.
00:13:37,00:13:40,"And they tried lots of other chocolate based things, this company."
00:13:40,00:13:42,So they also produced Stolverk.
00:13:42,00:13:44,They produced a chocolate clock and a chocolate train.
00:13:44,00:13:48,Which I think not a full on train.
00:13:48,00:13:51,People weren't going around in chocolate trains.
00:13:51,00:13:53,It's been going to Edinburgh to London.
00:13:53,00:13:56,"Also, where was the cool world we could have left it?"
00:13:56,00:13:59,I'm afraid there's more delays. Someone's eating the motor transport again.
00:13:59,00:14:03,There must be a better way.
00:14:03,00:14:10,All the sleepers are twixes and they're a pickaxes with the main rails.
00:14:10,00:14:13,Are there a little malteasers puffing out of the train?
00:14:13,00:14:15,Nice.
00:14:15,00:14:17,Okay.
00:14:17,00:14:19,"It's nice. We all want to live in this world now, don't we?"
00:14:20,00:14:21,"Yeah, very cool."
00:14:21,00:14:22,It's not real.
00:14:22,00:14:25,But they're word toy trains.
00:14:25,00:14:26,I'm not quite sure how they work.
00:14:26,00:14:28,"But yeah, chocolate clock, I don't know, I'm saying that works."
00:14:28,00:14:29,Because that's not a very useful clock.
00:14:29,00:14:31,That's not going to last a long time.
00:14:31,00:14:32,"No, no."
00:14:32,00:14:34,So this is where they didn't take off.
00:14:34,00:14:38,"Actually, I didn't even look up what the oldest piece of chocolate"
00:14:38,00:14:40,still existing is.
00:14:40,00:14:40,There must be some.
00:14:40,00:14:43,They keep finding bits of chocolate from the Antarctic expeditions.
00:14:43,00:14:47,"The Antarctic expeditions, just back to grammar phones."
00:14:47,00:14:50,There is a grammar phone that still is in Antarctica.
00:14:50,00:14:52,It's been there for over a hundred years.
00:14:52,00:14:56,Scott of the Antarctic took two grammar phones with him.
00:14:56,00:14:57,Two grammar?
00:14:57,00:14:58,Yeah.
00:14:58,00:14:59,"He was a fucking idiot, wasn't he?"
00:14:59,00:15:00,I mean...
00:15:00,00:15:03,I don't think he claims to feel sorry for him.
00:15:03,00:15:05,Wow.
00:15:05,00:15:08,I can imagine them in the tent at the end.
00:15:08,00:15:10,It's like we're so cold and hungry.
00:15:10,00:15:12,Can we eat the grammar phone?
00:15:12,00:15:14,"You brought the chocolate one, right?"
00:15:17,00:15:18,What was he thinking?
00:15:18,00:15:20,He brought hundreds of records.
00:15:20,00:15:21,That's amazing.
00:15:21,00:15:23,"Yeah, and so the idea was, because obviously they were in the hut for ages."
00:15:23,00:15:27,"So Sherry Garde, who wrote the worst journey in the world,"
00:15:27,00:15:29,"he said that after dinner every night,"
00:15:29,00:15:31,that's when the records would go on.
00:15:31,00:15:33,"And one was left there, and one made it back."
00:15:33,00:15:33,I've seen it.
00:15:33,00:15:36,There was an exhibition at the Natural History Museum in London.
00:15:36,00:15:37,I went to see it.
00:15:37,00:15:41,And they've actually made an album of the best of songs
00:15:41,00:15:43,that went along as a record.
00:15:43,00:15:46,But they couldn't play the records when they were out in the middle of nowhere.
00:15:46,00:15:47,They actually had notes.
00:15:47,00:15:48,"No, because they had Scott's hut."
00:15:48,00:15:50,So it was in the hut that they did.
00:15:50,00:15:51,"So before they went, probably, out in the middle of nowhere."
00:15:51,00:15:54,"You could have wine, not grammar phones, as well."
00:15:54,00:15:55,"The winding, okay."
00:15:55,00:15:57,"With captain notes, I know your hands are very cold,"
00:15:57,00:16:02,but would you mind taking them out of those gloves to wind up the grammar phone just one last time?
00:16:02,00:16:04,And then I promise you can go outside.
00:16:04,00:16:08,So this is quite a cool thing.
00:16:08,00:16:10,"You know the new five-pound notes, the plastic ones?"
00:16:10,00:16:13,"Yes, you can play a grammar phone record with a five-pound note."
00:16:13,00:16:15,"As the stylus, do you mean?"
00:16:15,00:16:17,"Yeah, so you sell the record spinning."
00:16:17,00:16:19,There's footage online that someone's doing it.
00:16:19,00:16:21,And it doesn't produce a brilliant sound.
00:16:21,00:16:25,"And you need an amplifier and stuff, but you can do it."
00:16:25,00:16:26,"Oh, really?"
00:16:26,00:16:28,You could probably use that five-pound note to buy an actual stylus.
00:16:28,00:16:32,I do know that.
00:16:32,00:16:33,I couldn't believe this.
00:16:33,00:16:38,There were basically iPods in the 1920s.
00:16:38,00:16:39,I don't believe that.
00:16:39,00:16:40,Yeah.
00:16:40,00:16:43,"Well, the word basically did a huge amount of heavy lifting with it, isn't it?"
00:16:43,00:16:45,What did they have?
00:16:45,00:16:48,These were things called Mickey Fones or Mikey Fones.
00:16:48,00:16:49,There were little music players.
00:16:49,00:16:53,"180,000 of them were produced in Switzerland."
00:16:53,00:16:56,"And they were, basically, they were tiny little music players,"
00:16:56,00:16:57,"like grammar phones or phonographs,"
00:16:57,00:16:59,that you could carry around in your handbag.
00:16:59,00:17:02,And they measured two by four inches.
00:17:02,00:17:05,And the only tiny thing about them was that they measured two by four inches
00:17:05,00:17:07,"when they were packed up, but then whenever you got somewhere,"
00:17:07,00:17:11,it was quite a complex assembly job to build a ten-inch record player.
00:17:11,00:17:13,So it couldn't play straight away.
00:17:13,00:17:14,"But even so, these are possible."
00:17:14,00:17:15,That's really cool.
00:17:15,00:17:17,Tiny little music players.
00:17:17,00:17:18,"Yeah, very cool."
00:17:18,00:17:21,"Now, Edison, when he sort of came up with the phonograph,"
00:17:21,00:17:24,"which was the pre-cursor to grammar phone records, I guess,"
00:17:24,00:17:27,"he thought that their main use would be,"
00:17:27,00:17:29,"well, one of their main uses would be phonographic books,"
00:17:29,00:17:32,"which will speak to blind people, he said,"
00:17:32,00:17:33,without any effort on their part.
00:17:33,00:17:34,"Basically, a podcast."
00:17:34,00:17:36,"It's an audio book or a podcast, yeah."
00:17:36,00:17:38,Wow.
00:17:38,00:17:41,"The phonographic recorded as well, didn't it, as playing."
00:17:41,00:17:42,I think that was the point of that.
00:17:42,00:17:45,And one of the main things they used it for was to record
00:17:45,00:17:47,the last words of the dying.
00:17:47,00:17:48,Wow.
00:17:48,00:17:49,That's so much pressure on someone who's dying
00:17:49,00:17:51,to nail your last words.
00:17:51,00:17:51,Yeah.
00:17:51,00:17:53,And then what if you don't go for another hour?
00:17:53,00:17:56,"You're just going to sit silently going, ""I don't."""
00:17:56,00:17:58,"It would also make you very paranoid, wouldn't it?"
00:17:58,00:18:00,"If you just felt a little bit peaky,"
00:18:00,00:18:04,and then your wife started getting the grammar phone rigged up in the corner.
00:18:04,00:18:08,"Honestly, darling, it's a cold."
00:18:11,00:18:12,"OK, we need to move on to our next fact."
00:18:12,00:18:16,"It is time for fact number three, and that is Chazinsky."
00:18:16,00:18:19,"My fact this week is that in the early 1700s,"
00:18:19,00:18:22,"the most popular British guide to the history,"
00:18:22,00:18:26,"language, and culture of Taiwan was written by a man"
00:18:26,00:18:28,who didn't speak the language had never been there
00:18:28,00:18:30,and knew nothing about it.
00:18:30,00:18:34,"This was in 1704, and I'd say Taiwan,"
00:18:34,00:18:37,"so it was Formosa then, which was what it was called,"
00:18:37,00:18:39,and it was called the History of Formosa.
00:18:39,00:18:43,And it described in huge detail the practices
00:18:43,00:18:46,"that these people who would have seemed so foreign to the people of Britain,"
00:18:46,00:18:49,"the practices that the Formosa people got up to,"
00:18:49,00:18:50,their language and everything.
00:18:50,00:18:53,"It was written by a guy called George Salmanetzar,"
00:18:53,00:18:55,and it was completely fake.
00:18:55,00:18:58,"He was a white, blonde, head, blue-eyed Frenchman"
00:18:58,00:19:00,who'd never left Europe.
00:19:00,00:19:03,"And to this day, we don't really know what his background was,"
00:19:03,00:19:07,"or what his real name was, because George Salmanetzar was a fate name."
00:19:07,00:19:11,And he just made this up. He convinced him that his pale skin
00:19:11,00:19:16,"and his appearance of being French and his French accent were,"
00:19:16,00:19:21,"because in Formosa, the upper classes live in underground palaces,"
00:19:21,00:19:23,"so they never see the sun, which he'd never caught."
00:19:23,00:19:25,"That's a good excuse, though, isn't it?"
00:19:25,00:19:28,"It's really quick thinking, yeah."
00:19:28,00:19:32,So he had this big showdown with the Royal Society of Scientists.
00:19:32,00:19:34,"They were all questioning him for ages about,"
00:19:34,00:19:36,"""Right, so, okay, if you really are from Formosa,"
00:19:36,00:19:37,"what about this?"""
00:19:37,00:19:41,"So Edmund Hayley of Comet fame asked him,"
00:19:41,00:19:44,"""How long does the sun shine down your chimneys?"""
00:19:44,00:19:45,And that's a really revealing question.
00:19:45,00:19:46,"Yeah, but no, come on."
00:19:46,00:19:50,"Like, if you went on holiday to Spain and they said to you,"
00:19:50,00:19:52,"""Yeah, but Andy, are you really from England?"
00:19:52,00:19:55,"How long does the sun shine down your chimney?"""
00:19:55,00:19:57,"I'd be stuffed, wouldn't I?"
00:19:57,00:19:58,Exactly.
00:19:58,00:19:59,So how's he supposed to know it?
00:19:59,00:20:01,Because that answer would have revealed
00:20:01,00:20:03,if he knew where it was on the planet.
00:20:03,00:20:04,Did he have an answer to it?
00:20:04,00:20:08,"He said, ""We have bent chimneys, so the sun doesn't shine down your..."""
00:20:08,00:20:10,"Yeah, and they said good answer."
00:20:10,00:20:10,Brilliant.
00:20:10,00:20:11,"Spiraled, wasn't it?"
00:20:11,00:20:13,"Yeah, spiral chimneys, yeah."
00:20:13,00:20:15,"Yeah, he's amazing character."
00:20:15,00:20:17,He said at Formosa that the men walk naked
00:20:17,00:20:21,except for a gold or silver plate to cover their privates.
00:20:21,00:20:23,He said that they executed murderers
00:20:23,00:20:26,by hanging them upside down and shooting them full of arrows.
00:20:26,00:20:29,"And annually, they sacrificed the hearts of 18,000 young boys"
00:20:29,00:20:31,to gods and priests to eat their bodies.
00:20:31,00:20:31,Yeah.
00:20:31,00:20:35,Which people did say to him if that is true
00:20:35,00:20:36,"and they sacrificed that number of people,"
00:20:36,00:20:39,you're not going to have many people left on this small island.
00:20:39,00:20:40,And he didn't have a good answer to that.
00:20:40,00:20:43,"But he said, ""Four Motions always sleep upright."""
00:20:43,00:20:45,And he actually then saw this through
00:20:45,00:20:47,because he had to live the habits of them.
00:20:47,00:20:48,I'm so...
00:20:48,00:20:50,He lost a regret in that.
00:20:50,00:20:54,"He used to, I think he sort of sat."
00:20:54,00:20:56,So he said a lot of Four Motions sleep standing up
00:20:56,00:20:58,and then he used to leave a candle on in his room.
00:20:58,00:21:00,So everyone could see that overnight
00:21:00,00:21:02,he was still erect in his chair
00:21:02,00:21:03,because he was Four Motions.
00:21:03,00:21:04,So he couldn't sleep in a normal bed.
00:21:04,00:21:08,"Bizarrely, he said that they all eat food raw."
00:21:08,00:21:09,Things like fish raw.
00:21:09,00:21:13,"And he was saying that Four Motions was part of Japan,"
00:21:13,00:21:14,which is a bit weird because it was actually
00:21:14,00:21:15,belonged to China then.
00:21:15,00:21:16,But he said it was part of Japan.
00:21:16,00:21:19,So that's strange that he kind of predicted sushi
00:21:19,00:21:21,300 years before it happened.
00:21:21,00:21:25,"So he got, basically, Four Motions was his third go at"
00:21:25,00:21:27,trying to convince people he was from somewhere else.
00:21:27,00:21:29,So he was originally from France.
00:21:29,00:21:31,His first bash of it was saying he was Irish.
00:21:31,00:21:33,"So he would go around saying, ""I'm Irish."""
00:21:33,00:21:34,"But the thing is, everyone knew the Irish."
00:21:34,00:21:36,"So they'd be like, ""Oh, so what are you?"""
00:21:36,00:21:37,"And he was like, ""I have no idea."""
00:21:37,00:21:39,"Just saying, ""Quickly, that's stuff up on him."""
00:21:39,00:21:41,"""Oh, have you been to the dog and duck in Dublin?"""
00:21:41,00:21:42,Yeah.
00:21:42,00:21:44,Then he said he was Japanese.
00:21:44,00:21:45,Right.
00:21:45,00:21:46,And then that failed on him as well
00:21:46,00:21:48,because Japan was getting too much.
00:21:48,00:21:49,People have been traveling there too much.
00:21:49,00:21:50,He needed to find somewhere else.
00:21:50,00:21:53,"Formosa was the third one that he finally landed on,"
00:21:53,00:21:54,which was useful to him.
00:21:54,00:21:58,"Another time in Four Motions there was a lot of Jesuits,"
00:21:58,00:21:59,Catholic missionaries.
00:21:59,00:22:02,And they knew everything that was happening there.
00:22:02,00:22:04,"And so when he came along, they were going,"
00:22:04,00:22:06,"""No, no, really, that doesn't happen."""
00:22:06,00:22:09,"But weirdly, because no one trusted Catholics at the time,"
00:22:09,00:22:12,they all trusted this one guy over all the Jesuits
00:22:12,00:22:13,"who were saying, ""No, this is bullshit."""
00:22:13,00:22:14,That's so funny.
00:22:14,00:22:16,"Well, at least the reputation of the church has recovered."
00:22:16,00:22:20,But we should emphasize that this was a big deal this book.
00:22:20,00:22:23,"Well, he wasn't just a weirdo with a pamphlet."
00:22:23,00:22:26,This was a book that was so believed that
00:22:26,00:22:30,"he lectured, who was advised to selecture on Formosa culture"
00:22:30,00:22:32,"and language, Oxford University."
00:22:32,00:22:35,"So he invented the entire language, alphabet and all,"
00:22:35,00:22:36,completely new alphabet.
00:22:36,00:22:39,A linguist studied it to see how consistent it was
00:22:39,00:22:41,and agreed it was definitely language.
00:22:41,00:22:43,To the extent that it remained in lots of language books
00:22:43,00:22:44,until the mid 19th century.
00:22:44,00:22:46,And people were still saying this is...
00:22:46,00:22:48,"People weren't doing GCSE Formosa, were they?"
00:22:48,00:22:53,Can I tell you quickly just something amazing about Formosa yourself?
00:22:53,00:22:56,Formosa now Taiwan.
00:22:56,00:23:00,"If you were in Formosa Taiwan, and you dug through the ground,"
00:23:00,00:23:03,"and you dug all the way through the earth onto the other side,"
00:23:03,00:23:06,"the antipode, as it's called,"
00:23:06,00:23:10,you would land in a place called Formosa Argentina.
00:23:10,00:23:12,Is that right?
00:23:12,00:23:12,No.
00:23:12,00:23:14,By total coincidence.
00:23:14,00:23:15,"Not by a coincidence, surely."
00:23:15,00:23:16,"By coincidence, yeah."
00:23:16,00:23:18,There's no relation that as far as we can see
00:23:18,00:23:20,between the two places that you would land.
00:23:20,00:23:23,"Yeah, there's a place in Argentina called Formosa."
00:23:23,00:23:26,"I mean, let's all definitely Google this after the show."
00:23:26,00:23:26,Sure.
00:23:26,00:23:28,That is incredible.
00:23:28,00:23:31,"If that remains in the episode, that means it is true."
00:23:31,00:23:33,And that is unbelievable.
00:23:33,00:23:35,"If not, you're welcome everywhere."
00:23:35,00:23:38,An exclusive.
00:23:38,00:23:41,"It would be around Argentina, so that just makes sense."
00:23:41,00:23:44,"So, we are in Devon at the moment."
00:23:44,00:23:47,And it seems like Devon is a bit of a hotbed for absolute fantasists.
00:23:47,00:23:51,"Yeah, so Andy, you definitely know about Tuesday,"
00:23:51,00:23:52,"Lob sang Rampa, don't you?"
00:23:52,00:23:53,"Oh, you're just from Devon."
00:23:54,00:23:55,"Was he, of course, too?"
00:23:55,00:23:59,"He was, he did a fraud saying he was a Tibetan monk."
00:23:59,00:24:01,And that was still happening in the 1950s.
00:24:01,00:24:02,He was saying that.
00:24:02,00:24:04,He said that he came from Tibet.
00:24:04,00:24:06,He made up a language.
00:24:06,00:24:09,"When they gave him actual Tibetan and said,"
00:24:09,00:24:11,"""Why do you not recognize this?"""
00:24:11,00:24:14,He said that he'd been so badly tortured during the war.
00:24:14,00:24:16,He'd blocked out all knowledge of the Tibetan language.
00:24:16,00:24:21,"And then afterwards, when they realized he wasn't actually Tibetan,"
00:24:21,00:24:26,"he said, ""Oh, no, no, no. Actually, I was possessed by the spirit of a Tibetan monk"
00:24:26,00:24:30,"after I fell out of a tree in London while trying to take a photograph of an owl."""
00:24:30,00:24:34,"Yep, he was, his name was Cyril Hoskins,"
00:24:34,00:24:37,"and he was an unemployed surgical trust manufacturer from Devon,"
00:24:37,00:24:41,who claimed to be an incredibly ancient and powerful Tibetan monk.
00:24:41,00:24:42,And he wrote 15 books.
00:24:42,00:24:47,"He wrote ""Travels with the Lama"" and ""Like Lama is in Del Lama."""
00:24:47,00:24:51,"And then he wrote one ""Living with the Lama"" which was dictated to him by his cat."
00:24:52,00:24:53,[laughter]
00:24:53,00:24:55,"""Mrs. Fifi Gray Whiskers."""
00:24:55,00:25:01,"And then he moved to, he later, he moved to Ireland and then Canada blatantly for tax reasons."
00:25:01,00:25:04,"Tell me you're up there. Yeah, he was great."
00:25:04,00:25:07,"Yeah, and then back in the 18th century,"
00:25:07,00:25:11,"you had someone called Princess Karabou, who was also from Devon."
00:25:11,00:25:14,"And she turned up at someone's house near Bristol,"
00:25:14,00:25:18,speaking a fake language and said she was from somewhere in the east.
00:25:18,00:25:21,"And again, she was from Devon and she made the whole thing up."
00:25:21,00:25:24,"She was from, I looked into it, I spotted that as well today."
00:25:24,00:25:28,"She was from somewhere that is a 30-minute drive from where we are right now,"
00:25:28,00:25:29,a little place called Withridge.
00:25:29,00:25:31,"Oh, hello."
00:25:31,00:25:33,Yeah?
00:25:33,00:25:37,But even the people of Cumbria looked out on the people of Withridge.
00:25:37,00:25:42,But it was a sort of tradition that travel-riding merged into fiction.
00:25:42,00:25:43,Yes.
00:25:43,00:25:45,"From about 1600, 1900, you couldn't quite tell."
00:25:45,00:25:46,There was basically three categories.
00:25:46,00:25:49,There was Gulliver's Travel Style.
00:25:49,00:25:50,This is a fictional travel account.
00:25:50,00:25:52,And then there were proper travel journals.
00:25:52,00:25:55,"And then there were loads of people who were just kind of making stuff up,"
00:25:55,00:25:56,but pretending it was true.
00:25:56,00:25:59,And there was the Travels of Sir John Mandeville.
00:25:59,00:26:01,"Actually, so this was much earlier,"
00:26:01,00:26:03,but he was almost the precursor to all of these.
00:26:03,00:26:06,These appeared in about the 1360s.
00:26:06,00:26:11,And they were taken as legit travel books for over 300 years.
00:26:11,00:26:14,"So Christopher Columbus used them as a complete reference book,"
00:26:14,00:26:16,like all the great travelers of later ages did.
00:26:16,00:26:19,"And they covered China, India,"
00:26:19,00:26:20,present-day Indonesia.
00:26:20,00:26:24,And they told these amazing stories of like Ireland's first-hand account
00:26:24,00:26:27,of people who had the bodies of humans in the heads of dogs.
00:26:27,00:26:33,"Or people whose mouths were so small that they had to suck all their food through reeds,"
00:26:33,00:26:34,because they just had a tiny hole for a mouth.
00:26:34,00:26:39,"And he said, ""All the Mongols eat their father as soon as they die."""
00:26:39,00:26:40,"They went, ""Okay, great."""
00:26:40,00:26:42,That was the thing that Sal Manazar claimed.
00:26:42,00:26:45,He claimed that he said he was divorced
00:26:45,00:26:48,"and that he was a reformed cannibal because, in Formosa,"
00:26:48,00:26:51,husbands were allowed to eat their wives.
00:26:51,00:26:54,"If there was adultery that had happened,"
00:26:54,00:26:55,"if their wives had committed adultery, you were allowed to do so."
00:26:55,00:26:58,There was always a lot of cannibalism going on in these stories
00:26:58,00:27:01,when there was like the idea of weird foreigners would eat humans.
00:27:01,00:27:04,Although the guy who yottled about John Mandeville
00:27:04,00:27:07,he found one group of people whose only source of nourishment
00:27:07,00:27:09,was the smell of apples.
00:27:09,00:27:15,"And he also found that he said that in Ethiopia,"
00:27:15,00:27:17,"""All the people had only one foot,"
00:27:17,00:27:20,"but that foot was so large that it shadowed them from the sun."""
00:27:20,00:27:23,"""Oh, come on, how does that work?"""
00:27:23,00:27:27,"""They would lie on the back and hold their massive foot."""
00:27:27,00:27:28,"""Oh, wow!"""
00:27:28,00:27:30,It was awful when they wanted to go bowling.
00:27:30,00:27:37,"""That's pretty cool. We should evolve like that."""
00:27:37,00:27:38,"This is a slightly off topic,"
00:27:38,00:27:41,"but PL Travers, the writer of Mary Poppins,"
00:27:41,00:27:43,she was into one massive foot.
00:27:44,00:27:46,"She was into a lot of esoteric stuff,"
00:27:46,00:27:50,and she went on a trip at one point with a spiritual guru
00:27:50,00:27:52,who she looked up to where they were searching the earth
00:27:52,00:27:56,for a giant footprint that was said to be made
00:27:56,00:28:00,by an intergalactic giant who used earth as a stepping stone
00:28:00,00:28:02,as he was hopping through the universe.
00:28:02,00:28:04,And she was convinced there was a giant footprint
00:28:04,00:28:07,"that would be a rather necromanic, I don't know if that's true."
00:28:07,00:28:09,"Sorry, where was she writing?"
00:28:09,00:28:10,"Well, 30s, 40s, 50s?"
00:28:10,00:28:13,"Yeah, but she was part of a very big spiritual,"
00:28:13,00:28:15,"very lobsome, uh, rampant kind of movement."
00:28:15,00:28:16,"Can you believe it? Any shit, didn't they?"
00:28:16,00:28:17,Until almost now.
00:28:17,00:28:20,"Yeah, you're right. Everyone's making really"
00:28:20,00:28:22,fact-based sensual decisions these days.
00:28:22,00:28:25,Thank God we've come so far.
00:28:25,00:28:28,"It's time for our final fact of the show,"
00:28:28,00:28:29,and that is my fact.
00:28:29,00:28:31,"My fact this week is that,"
00:28:31,00:28:33,"ahead of breeding season,"
00:28:33,00:28:35,Iceland publishes an illustrated catalogue
00:28:35,00:28:37,of the country's most eligible sheep.
00:28:41,00:28:42,"Yeah, so this is called the RAM Registry."
00:28:42,00:28:44,It's an annual catalogue that they make available.
00:28:44,00:28:47,It starts online then they do a physical publication.
00:28:47,00:28:51,"And it um, it profiles in this, in the last year that's gone,"
00:28:51,00:28:52,44 RAMs.
00:28:52,00:28:54,They do color photos.
00:28:54,00:28:55,They do pedigrees breeding.
00:28:55,00:28:56,It's all these stats.
00:28:56,00:28:58,It tells you everything you need to know.
00:28:58,00:29:01,"Um, it's a 52 page catalogue."
00:29:01,00:29:05,They have an obituary section for RAMs that have passed away.
00:29:05,00:29:08,"I think if Tinder had an obituary section,"
00:29:08,00:29:09,it would be more interesting.
00:29:09,00:29:13,"Yeah, that's true, but it has stuff like how many,"
00:29:13,00:29:15,"how many they're expected to sigh or it's just,"
00:29:15,00:29:17,it's the ultimate guide that you need
00:29:17,00:29:19,for when it's breeding season you want.
00:29:19,00:29:21,"I want that and that's how they,"
00:29:21,00:29:22,that's how they spend their money.
00:29:22,00:29:23,This thing is 20 years old.
00:29:23,00:29:26,This Registry is well established.
00:29:26,00:29:28,There's a RAM in this year's called Strumper.
00:29:28,00:29:32,"And Strumper, they say, the farmer who owns him,"
00:29:32,00:29:34,"says Strumper, he is aware of his environment"
00:29:34,00:29:37,and knows exactly what's expected of him.
00:29:37,00:29:40,"Oh, he doesn't call himself a Strumper."
00:29:40,00:29:42,He calls himself an exotic dancer.
00:29:42,00:29:47,"But they get, they get graded for leadership as well."
00:29:47,00:29:50,"So there are these, there are these sheep which are called flock leaders"
00:29:50,00:29:54,and they automatically act as leaders to the rest of the flock.
00:29:54,00:29:57,"And they, that's very important because they go off into the mountains"
00:29:57,00:30:00,"and you need a, uh, RAM in charge,"
00:30:00,00:30:03,"who sort of, um, you know, when the weather's going to be bad,"
00:30:03,00:30:04,when they can force all the weather.
00:30:04,00:30:06,"So when they think the weather's going to be bad,"
00:30:06,00:30:08,they lead the flock to shelter and safety.
00:30:08,00:30:09,Wow.
00:30:09,00:30:12,And the sheep which are particularly intelligent subbreed
00:30:12,00:30:14,are called Icelandic leader sheep.
00:30:14,00:30:16,Because they show leadership.
00:30:16,00:30:21,"Oh, I don't think that's why, but it's a very nice coincidence."
00:30:21,00:30:25,"And then, but the thing is, on like day snaps,"
00:30:25,00:30:28,"they never get to meet the lady, um, sheep today,"
00:30:28,00:30:31,because basically it's a sperm donor kind of thing.
00:30:31,00:30:34,"So even when they're swipes on, they're just like,"
00:30:34,00:30:36,"I know, all you're going to get is my sperm."
00:30:36,00:30:38,Oh my god. Thank God Tinder doesn't run like that.
00:30:38,00:30:41,"I've never used Tinder, but, uh, is that not how it works?"
00:30:41,00:30:44,"I used to, but I'd never just pop my sperm in the purse."
00:30:44,00:30:45,This isn't the purse anyway.
00:30:45,00:30:47,Swipe to ride on me.
00:30:47,00:30:49,I think that might be a relief for a lot of women on Tinder.
00:30:49,00:30:55,Thank God a cup of sperm doesn't text me with a lot of stamps.
00:30:55,00:30:56,I'm ready.
00:30:56,00:30:58,First class male.
00:30:58,00:31:02,"Wait, is that first class male?"
00:31:02,00:31:03,Both ways round.
00:31:03,00:31:06,But they're into sheep.
00:31:06,00:31:07,Are they in Iceland?
00:31:07,00:31:08,"Oh, yeah, yeah."
00:31:08,00:31:10,"Have three times as many sheep as people,"
00:31:10,00:31:14,"and they have this amazing ceremony every, every winter."
00:31:14,00:31:17,"So basically the sheep in Iceland, they have this weird farming system"
00:31:17,00:31:19,"where all different farmers, different herds of sheep"
00:31:19,00:31:22,are free to roam with each other up on the mountains.
00:31:22,00:31:24,"So they're all intermingle, which is a massive hassle"
00:31:24,00:31:27,"when it comes to bringing them back down to put them in your pen,"
00:31:27,00:31:28,because they're all mixed up.
00:31:28,00:31:30,And so they just recruit everyone.
00:31:30,00:31:33,"So if you're a tourist in Iceland at, you know, pen time,"
00:31:33,00:31:36,"and it's got a name, I think it's called Retire Time,"
00:31:36,00:31:39,"and then you go and you help round up sheep,"
00:31:39,00:31:41,and you have to shimmy them down the mountain.
00:31:41,00:31:43,And you put them into this big enclosure
00:31:43,00:31:45,with a central bit in the middle.
00:31:45,00:31:48,"And then you, they've got little marks on their ears"
00:31:48,00:31:49,that show which farmer they belong to.
00:31:49,00:31:52,"And if you see them, aren't you, grab it by the ear"
00:31:52,00:31:53,or by the scratch of its neck?
00:31:53,00:31:55,You lift it up and you chuck it into the bit of that enclosure.
00:31:55,00:31:57,Did he lift it up? The chuck it?
00:31:57,00:31:58,Did you lift it up and throw it?
00:31:58,00:31:59,That was very strong.
00:31:59,00:32:00,All right.
00:32:00,00:32:04,"The sheep are really, they're really perfect in Iceland, aren't they?"
00:32:04,00:32:06,They don't have any kind of other genes.
00:32:06,00:32:08,"They're like, they've been there since the Vikings"
00:32:08,00:32:09,and they've never had--
00:32:09,00:32:11,"All right, captain Aryan over there."
00:32:11,00:32:15,No one's sullied these genes.
00:32:15,00:32:18,"Well, this is what they think."
00:32:18,00:32:20,"They think that because they've been there for the whole time,"
00:32:20,00:32:22,they're not sullied by any other blood.
00:32:22,00:32:28,"And in 1878, they imported a single English ram into Iceland,"
00:32:28,00:32:31,and they had to kill 60% of Icelandic flocks
00:32:31,00:32:35,because they spread disease and parasites to the flocks.
00:32:35,00:32:36,English tourists are best in the world.
00:32:36,00:32:40,"They love eating the sheep as well,"
00:32:40,00:32:43,"as well, obviously, because, you know, sheep are eaten."
00:32:43,00:32:47,"But there's a thing called swith, which is half a sheep's head."
00:32:47,00:32:48,That's a delicacy.
00:32:48,00:32:52,And they make sour testicles and brain jam.
00:32:52,00:32:57,"Well, they-- so I found out the best way to eat the boiled sheep's brain,"
00:32:57,00:32:59,which is something that is a real delicacy.
00:32:59,00:33:01,And this is because there's an MP.
00:33:01,00:33:03,I think he might have been the foreign minister
00:33:03,00:33:04,or the homosexual or something.
00:33:04,00:33:07,"He's a guy called, uh, why didn't I practice this name"
00:33:07,00:33:08,before I came on stage.
00:33:08,00:33:11,He's called Osso Scalfeoyonton.
00:33:11,00:33:14,Osso Scalfeoyonton.
00:33:14,00:33:15,"Well, I think he's safely anonymous."
00:33:15,00:33:16,That's the main thing.
00:33:16,00:33:18,"He's not sat at home going,"
00:33:18,00:33:20,"why are they talking about me, is he?"
00:33:20,00:33:21,"No, he's not."
00:33:21,00:33:23,Wouldn't it be that guy who would react?
00:33:23,00:33:25,But he was in 2013.
00:33:25,00:33:27,He was serving some sheep's brain at a party.
00:33:27,00:33:31,"And he said, ""This is amongst the best boiled sheep said I've ever had."
00:33:31,00:33:33,"They stuck to my gum as proper heads should."""
00:33:33,00:33:35,So that's what I was supposed to do.
00:33:35,00:33:36,They stick to the gum.
00:33:36,00:33:37,And then he was asked really if it wasn't the best.
00:33:37,00:33:40,"And he was like, ""Okay, look, it wasn't the very best."
00:33:40,00:33:41,"The head should have been more fermented."""
00:33:41,00:33:43,"Because we, from the West Fjords,"
00:33:43,00:33:45,prefer our sheep's head so fermented
00:33:45,00:33:47,that we can drink the eye out of the eye socket.
00:33:47,00:33:51,So that's what you're going for.
00:33:51,00:33:52,"Wow, goodness."
00:33:52,00:33:55,"In 2018, two men in Iceland summoned the police"
00:33:55,00:33:58,and the coast guard after they'd seen a polar bear
00:33:58,00:33:59,on a peninsula.
00:33:59,00:34:00,And that's obviously incredibly dangerous
00:34:00,00:34:01,because they really don't come near.
00:34:01,00:34:03,He was very often.
00:34:03,00:34:05,"Eventually, after a lengthy search,"
00:34:05,00:34:07,"the search was called off and the man admitted,"
00:34:07,00:34:08,it may just have been a large sheep.
00:34:08,00:34:16,It's just a lot closer than they thought.
00:34:16,00:34:17,It's understandable.
00:34:17,00:34:22,I know how to artificially inseminate a cow
00:34:22,00:34:24,based on researching for this podcast.
00:34:24,00:34:25,Cool.
00:34:25,00:34:28,So this is obviously about pairing sheep up with each other
00:34:28,00:34:30,so they can mate properly.
00:34:30,00:34:31,"And dairy cows, you do the same thing."
00:34:31,00:34:35,So I think 75% of dairy cows in this country
00:34:35,00:34:37,"when they have to be inseminated, they get inseminated,"
00:34:37,00:34:40,but just by semen rather than the actual bull.
00:34:40,00:34:42,"And for some reason, I found myself reading"
00:34:42,00:34:45,this really in-depth farmer's guide to how to do it.
00:34:45,00:34:46,"And what I didn't realise was,"
00:34:46,00:34:50,"so you get a semen gun, which you put the semen in."
00:34:50,00:34:51,[LAUGHTER]
00:34:51,00:34:53,Did you bring your semen gun to a gun fight?
00:34:53,00:34:55,No.
00:34:55,00:34:57,[LAUGHTER]
00:34:57,00:34:59,Amit.
00:34:59,00:35:01,You bring your semen gun to the insemination fight.
00:35:01,00:35:04,"And, but what you do is, you have to--"
00:35:04,00:35:07,so there are two entries into a cow.
00:35:07,00:35:09,So as much of the humans--
00:35:09,00:35:10,Yeah.
00:35:10,00:35:12,You've got the--
00:35:12,00:35:13,"Oh, sorry."
00:35:13,00:35:14,There are three.
00:35:14,00:35:16,"Oh, sorry, there are three."
00:35:16,00:35:19,"Where are you, Devin?"
00:35:19,00:35:22,"Something tells me, you are not the biggest expert"
00:35:22,00:35:24,in this room.
00:35:24,00:35:28,Are there a number of ways into a cow?
00:35:28,00:35:30,"I know that people have never know all these secret ways,"
00:35:30,00:35:37,"but there are two entries into the back of a cow, officially."
00:35:37,00:35:41,"And so one is the rectum, as we all have."
00:35:41,00:35:42,It's one professor.
00:35:42,00:35:43,Let me write this down.
00:35:43,00:35:49,"Children, what do you be quiet?"
00:35:49,00:35:52,"You've got the rectum, and then you've got the sex tubes"
00:35:52,00:35:55,and they're different.
00:35:55,00:35:58,"All right, the cervix."
00:35:58,00:36:01,"But what you do is, amazingly, when you're inseminating a cow,"
00:36:01,00:36:03,you obviously have to stick the gun in the cervix.
00:36:03,00:36:09,"But the way you navigate the gun into the uterine horns,"
00:36:09,00:36:12,"as they're called, is you have to put your other arm"
00:36:12,00:36:14,that's not holding the gun into the rectum.
00:36:14,00:36:17,[LAUGHTER]
00:36:17,00:36:19,So it's so amazing.
00:36:19,00:36:23,"And they say, shove your arm into the rectum."
00:36:23,00:36:27,Get someone else to hold the cow's tail aside while you do this.
00:36:27,00:36:30,You have to be a bald farmer who tried using one foot.
00:36:30,00:36:31,[LAUGHTER]
00:36:31,00:36:32,In the cow's tail.
00:36:32,00:36:35,[LAUGHTER]
00:36:35,00:36:37,This is the worst game of twist around ever played.
00:36:37,00:36:42,[LAUGHTER]
00:36:42,00:36:45,"It says left hand, sex tubes."
00:36:45,00:36:49,"Anyway, look, it just feels like this lesson isn't going to end."
00:36:49,00:36:53,So you essentially use your rectum arm
00:36:53,00:36:58,"to navigate your semen gun, which is in the vaginal canal."
00:36:58,00:36:59,And you push it through.
00:36:59,00:37:02,"So you've got your arm in the rectum,"
00:37:02,00:37:04,and it's pushing against the other canal
00:37:04,00:37:06,so that it gets into the uterus.
00:37:06,00:37:08,And it's called recto vaginal insemination.
00:37:08,00:37:10,And that's lesson over.
00:37:10,00:37:11,Enjoy.
00:37:11,00:37:14,[APPLAUSE]
00:37:14,00:37:16,"OK, that is it."
