00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,800
 Hi everybody, Andy here. Just before we start this week's show I have a little

2
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:08,960
 announcement to make. We're in Plug Corner because I have written a book. I

3
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:13,040
 have offended again against all the people who say don't, don't do another

4
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:17,320
 one, just stop at two and I've written a third one and this one for the first time

5
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:22,760
 ever I've written something that is fun and funny as well as being gripping. It's

6
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:26,640
 called a beginner's guide to breaking and entering. It's about a young man

7
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:31,480
 called Al who lives in gorgeous empty second homes while the real owners are

8
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:35,160
 away. He's got a whole set of rules to help him get into these beautiful houses

9
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:39,480
 he could never afford to live in. He has a great life until about chapter 3 when

10
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:42,840
 he and his friends break into the wrong house on the wrong day, somebody ends up

11
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:47,040
 dead and everything goes wrong from there. It's funny, it's gripping, it's

12
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:50,800
 pacy. There's a little bit of a message about housing in there. It's a perfect

13
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:54,480
 summer read, people have been really nice about it. Val McDermid, Lisa Joule, some of

14
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:58,120
 the Queens of Crime have been incredibly kind about it. It's out on the 25th of

15
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:02,120
 April so if you order it now you will be among the first cohort globally to

16
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:05,800
 receive your gorgeous copy and they're really nice looking copies. Please do

17
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:09,000
 pre-order it, it can really be the difference between a book flying and

18
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,920
 not flying if it has a few pre-orders under its belt before that crucial first

19
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:17,040
 week. It's out in all good bookshops, it's out in all bad bookshops, it's in most bookshops

20
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,160
 in the Commonwealth basically. All you need to do is go in and say I would like

21
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:23,080
 a copy of a beginner's guide to breaking and entering by Andrew Hunter Murray.

22
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:26,520
 Waterstones even have signed copies if you'd like to get a hold of one of those.

23
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:30,760
 I promise it's good, I've put a lot into it, I'm gonna stop banging on about it

24
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:33,400
 now. It's called a beginner's guide to breaking and entering. Thanks very much for

25
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:36,880
 listening to this. On with the podcast!

26
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:55,760
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast

27
00:01:55,760 --> 00:02:00,080
 coming to you from the Kiwai offices in Hobon. My name is Alex Bell and I'm

28
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:05,520
 joined by Anna Shusinski, Andrew Hunter Murray and James Harkin and once again we

29
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:08,560
 are gathered around the microphone to share our four favourite facts from the

30
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:13,280
 last seven days so in no particular order here we go. Starting with fact number

31
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:18,520
 one and that is Andy. My fact is that half the nitrogen in your body was made in

32
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:25,360
 a factory. Which factory? It won't have been made in the UK anymore because of

33
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:31,520
 Brexit. It's a range of factors. But the last nitrogen making factory I think has

34
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:37,920
 just shut down. Is that the billing of manufacturing plugs? Yes it is.

35
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:41,320
 Has that closed? I didn't know that. It either has done or is about to but let's

36
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:47,520
 zoom out a little bit. Just thinking though. Even if it's just closed,

37
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:51,920
 surely it takes a while for all the nitrogen to be replaced so maybe some

38
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:55,600
 of it's British nitrogen in my body? You might have some British nitrogen in you

39
00:02:55,600 --> 00:03:01,240
 but I'm afraid a lot of it would be filthy foreign nitrogen. Right, all

40
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:06,480
 life forms, don't write in, most life forms, mammals and plants all contain

41
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:10,320
 nitrogen. It's a really important component in your body. It's required to

42
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:13,800
 make the protein in your body and all these various hormones, neurotransmitters,

43
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:19,800
 it's vital. Nitrogen is very important and most of the air is nitrogen,

44
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:24,120
 78% of the atmosphere is nitrogen but that's not where you get your

45
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:27,000
 nitrogen from. So you can't just breathe in the nitrogen from the air and get it in

46
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,280
 your body? No, even if you hold your breath for ages, none of the nitrogen

47
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:34,920
 goes in that way. It doesn't work. For a waste. What a waste but you get it from

48
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:39,520
 your food. So meat, fish, dairy, vegetable, cereals, nuts, all of those foods

49
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:45,080
 contain some nitrogen, right? So plants get it from the air. I mean there's a

50
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:48,680
 complicated bacterial process. That's all we'll get there.

51
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:52,880
 Or lightning. Or lightning and that's another way. We'll get there as well.

52
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:57,880
 The point is that about two or three kilos of your body, roughly half of your

53
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:02,760
 forearm to the end of your hand, is nitrogen. Is that where it all is?

54
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:06,720
 So the amount of you made in a factory is roughly your hand and wrist and that's

55
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:12,360
 because nitrogen-based fertilizer has become an enormous thing in the last

56
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:16,800
 century. It's incredibly important. It's why the human population has risen from

57
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:20,800
 one or two billion to now eight billion. The sole reason is that we have enough

58
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:24,760
 ways of feeding people because we have enough fertilizers to grow crops and

59
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:27,920
 the way we do that is with this brilliant chemical process discovered at the

60
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:33,120
 start of the 20th century which allows us to pull nitrogen from the sky and make

61
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:38,440
 it into fertilizer to make plants grow. Does this mean I'm not organic? Yeah.

62
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:43,360
 That's the point of buying all that nice food. Nitrogen fixation. Do you remember

63
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:47,240
 learning about that? That was where I sort of lost interest and now coming back

64
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:51,560
 to it I thought, God this is fascinating. But poor old nitrogen being told it has to

65
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:55,760
 be fixed. So there's this conundrum which Andy sort of touched on where it's

66
00:04:55,760 --> 00:05:00,880
 the air's full of it but plants can't take it in without assistance and so it

67
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:05,740
 needs to be fixed by these bacteria that basically make plant roots grow these

68
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:09,760
 nodules which act as their homes and then they live in these nodules and they

69
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:14,200
 fix this nitrogen turning into ammonia which plants can use. And the nitrogen

70
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:20,120
 came originally from a star exploding. Ooh. That's essentially it. Didn't know that?

71
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:23,440
 The big bang can make hydrogen helium but anything else needs to be made in

72
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:28,120
 stars. The original nitrogen factory is a star. Yeah exactly. So some star created

73
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:32,520
 lots of nitrogen then it exploded. Eventually it came to Earth. Then

74
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:37,680
 eventually it got in the sky. Then eventually a bacterium fixed it and then

75
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:40,760
 it got put into a carrot and then you ate the carrot and then it went into your

76
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:43,600
 bloodstream and then it got turned into proteins which got turned into muscles.

77
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:48,560
 It definitely gets less exciting. Part of the journey starts off really well and

78
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:52,280
 then it's sort of sitting in a carrot. Yeah so how did we learn to make this

79
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:58,720
 stuff? Oh I'm so glad you asked. Oh it's like inside the factory with Greg Wallace.

80
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:09,320
 It's all thanks to something called the Haber-Bosch process or Haber-Bosch

81
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:14,440
 sometimes known. So Flitz Haber and Karl Bosch were two German chemists and the

82
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:17,240
 problem was like everyone knew that we needed more nitrogen at the time but it

83
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:20,680
 was very hard to work out how we're going to actually get it. And you know what we

84
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:24,000
 talked about? Guano, like the Guano Gold Rush because bird poo contains lots of

85
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,160
 nitrates. So that in the 19th century was used to increase crop yields and that

86
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:33,080
 saved everyone's bacon and you know it was brilliant for a while. They ran out of bacon very

87
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:41,800
 nice. Talking about the Haber-Bosch process. Can I talk about bacon? You know bacon is

88
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:46,880
 most bacon is cured with nitrates as in that's what makes it last longer which

89
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:51,320
 is a type of nitrogen or it's a molecule with nitrogen in it and when

90
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:56,360
 it goes green bacon that is something called nitrate burn and it's a

91
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:59,760
 reaction to the chemical that's used to cure it and it means that it's still

92
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:03,680
 good to eat. So if your bacon's got a bit green you can still eat it. Amazing. It's

93
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:07,800
 not bacteria, it's not anything that's bad for you, it's just a natural part of

94
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:11,120
 the process. I thought it was rotten. Yeah. I thought my bacon had gone off. I'm not

95
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:14,600
 saying that all green bacon is good to eat. That's what I've taken away from this.

96
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:18,280
 But if you bought it only a week ago it's probably fine. Sorry Andy you were

97
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:23,640
 saying about Bosch and Haber. Haber. Yeah so basically he was a chemist and it was

98
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:28,040
 a very difficult process to work out. He knew that lightning as you said

99
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:31,240
 James breaks apart nitrogen bonds because nitrogen molecules are really

100
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:34,400
 tightly bonded. It takes a lot of effort to break them apart to turn them into

101
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:38,160
 ammonia but eventually he worked out sort of pressurized process to combine

102
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:42,160
 nitrogen and hydrogen and that makes the ammonia fertilizer and he developed

103
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:47,640
 that in 1913 Haber and it was just before the war and there's a theory that it

104
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:50,520
 actually kept the first world war going for longer than it should have done

105
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:55,680
 because German imports of fertilizer were blockaded but he was able to he had

106
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:58,760
 created a process where you could make as they called it bread from air. So if we

107
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:02,440
 stopped any poo from getting over to Germany during the war they could make

108
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:07,240
 their own stuff. Exactly. Yeah basically yeah I mean that was it. And he got the

109
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:10,800
 Nobel Prize for it didn't he which was extremely controversial. It was very

110
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:14,160
 controversial. On the cover of his other legacy. Yeah because he made poison gas.

111
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:18,840
 Right. That's so funny. I can't believe the Nobel Prize in 1919 went to someone

112
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:23,120
 who'd invented which gas was it was it? Chlorine. Chlorine gas. It's bad. It was quite

113
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:28,360
 controversial. Yeah. He did kill 90,000 people with it. Not he didn't go round

114
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:32,000
 personally spraying it into the trenches. Yeah he was responsible for the birth of

115
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,680
 arguably six billion. Yeah absolutely. And round the bounce. Do you think on like

116
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:39,000
 interviews and stuff he's like I don't want to talk about that. I want to talk about my

117
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:44,800
 Nobel Prize winning work. Because his wife Clara was a chemist as well and they

118
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:49,920
 had a huge dispute after the I think the first battle of Ypres where poison gas

119
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:53,120
 was used for the first time and killed thousands. He said it was no different

120
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:56,640
 killing someone with a bomber bullet. She said it is very different. And then

121
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:01,840
 she she killed herself. She shot her. The ultimate axe in an argument. We don't

122
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:05,600
 know for sure that the argument is what led to the suicide. I really believe any

123
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:09,160
 notes or anything like that. But we know she really she's fascinating Clara

124
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:13,000
 Haber and or Harbert if you're a German listening. She was Germany's first female

125
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:18,720
 doctor of chemistry. She got a PhD in 1900. And she turned him down. The first

126
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:21,040
 time Fritz proposed she turned him down because she wanted to be financially

127
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:25,320
 independent. Which is crazy in 1900 as a woman. But she'd gone hey I want to live

128
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:29,120
 under my own steam. And then she decided marriage would kind of empower her which

129
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:33,160
 it bloody well didn't. Which she did complain about. Understandably she was

130
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:36,840
 like hang on my husband turns out to be very self-serving constantly working. I

131
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:41,760
 don't have a chance at all to develop my career. And he's a mass murderer. And it

132
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,800
 turns out he's a mass murderer and that's the final straw. And he was like no no

133
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:49,440
 talk about that other stuff. Did you see pictures of her? I think she looks a

134
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:54,120
 bit like Fanella Dan's wife. Oh do you? Yeah I haven't seen a photo of her. I'm not

135
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:58,240
 very good with faces as we all know. And that was what I thought. And do you

136
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:02,880
 associate Dan with Fritz Haber the mass murdering but mass life producing

137
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:07,280
 complex character? In some ways. But I think Dan is more of a wife guy than Fritz

138
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:13,880
 Haber was. So then Haber escaped to Switzerland wearing a false beard after

139
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:18,600
 the war. Amazing. And then after World War One because obviously we had then

140
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:22,520
 had the Treaty of Versailles which really punished Germany right. And so he

141
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:27,680
 came up with the idea of extracting gold from the ocean to pay off all of the war

142
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:31,560
 reparations. Because he knew that there was loads and loads of gold in the ocean.

143
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:35,320
 And he thought if I can get at that we'll be rich beyond our wildest dreams.

144
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:40,520
 It doesn't work. And actually we still can't do it of course. What's the term that I think

145
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:43,600
 you've told me about Jamesford when Nobel Prize winners win a prize and then

146
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,880
 they come up with a really insane and subsequent idea? It goes to their head.

147
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:51,600
 Nobelitis. Nobelitis sounds like a serious case. But if you've done it once but you've

148
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:55,200
 literally made bread from air. The human population is going to grow by

149
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:59,480
 billions. From the guy who brought bread from air comes gold from the ocean.

150
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:02,320
 It works. I believe it.

151
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:08,720
 And actually, sort of associated, the Nobel Prize in 1935 was awarded for

152
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:12,560
 basically being able to turn an element into another element which was the

153
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:15,680
 alchemy that people had dreamed of forever and ever. That people had tried to

154
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:20,120
 make gold and actually this was turning boron into nitrogen which wasn't quite

155
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:25,480
 the fantasy of a 17th century alchemist. But like these factories were

156
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:31,000
 taking already existing nitrogen out of the air and making it into ammonia which

157
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,400
 could be used. But Marie Curie's daughter who won that prize, right? I remember her

158
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:38,520
 name. But that was actually making new nitrogen which no one had ever done

159
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:43,920
 before. Totally. So this was amazing. And I didn't realise that. She was the second

160
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:48,440
 female to win a Nobel Prize, Marie Curie's daughter. Was Marie Curie the

161
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:56,360
 first? Yes. And it was Leppo, baby. But it was husband and wife as well. So just

162
00:11:56,360 --> 00:12:00,280
 like Marie Curie and her husband Pierre who won a joint prize. Sweetly, it was

163
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:04,400
 Marie Curie's daughter Irene and her husband Frederick Joliot Curie who won

164
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:07,360
 the Nobel Prize in 1935. Do you think that maybe they didn't have a chance

165
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:10,600
 unless you sort of did stand behind a man a bit and then? I'm sure there was

166
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:13,640
 something about that. Although her surname was Curie so I think that probably

167
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:19,440
 helped. I think that opened a few doors. And also her way of making nitrogen was

168
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:24,800
 firing radioactivity at Boron, wasn't it? I think. Yeah. So it's kind of, you know,

169
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:29,440
 in the parents' realm. Okay. Yes, she probably had her equipment in the

170
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:35,640
 garage already. And if memory serves I think she died of leukemia, didn't she?

171
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:39,560
 What, the younger? I think Irene did. Related to the work she'd done? I'm sure.

172
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:42,800
 I'm gonna be honest, I'm going off memory but I think that's right. Because Marie,

173
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:46,120
 it was the last thing that Marie almost did, was see the results of her daughter's

174
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:51,160
 successful test before she died of leukemia. Yeah, nice. One thing on the

175
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:56,440
 Billingham manufacturing plan. Oh, thank God. Thank God. Instructs nontes in England.

176
00:12:56,440 --> 00:13:01,520
 We'd better get a free trip. Out of it. It's closed. I'm not going to close down.

177
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:05,560
 I've had worse daytrips out of it, you know, I credit Cardiff.

178
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:11,000
 Aldous Huxley went there. They gave him a trip around and he based some of Brave New

179
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,560
 World on it. So you know in Brave New World they like have a factory making

180
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:19,000
 humans, I think, don't they? Yeah. And like, yeah, they make clones and stuff like that.

181
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,560
 Yeah. And he saw this Billingham factory that was effectively making life by

182
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:26,320
 making this nitrogen. I am imagining like Willy Wonka style, like it's so

183
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:30,040
 whimsical. It's a reverse Willy Wonka, because in Willy Wonka don't the kids

184
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:33,800
 go in and never come out. Whereas in Brave New World you get loads of new kids from

185
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:36,880
 the factory. The kids do come out, they just come out all weird shapes and

186
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:40,760
 colours. They've all been really quite fucked up psychologically and physically.

187
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:44,640
 Every chocolate factory has a nitrogen factory next to it to make new children.

188
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:53,000
 I learned about what I think is the most exciting moment in history. In all of

189
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,960
 history. As we said at the start nitrogen is essential for life because it makes

190
00:13:56,960 --> 00:14:00,880
 amino acids which make proteins and that's like the whole building box of

191
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:05,280
 what all living things are made of. But there's this kind of mystery which is

192
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:09,920
 how did the first life get its nitrogen? Because as we've said it needs this

193
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:14,400
 bacteria to be made accessible. And it can also be made by lightning striking

194
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:18,800
 through it. But actually not enough seems to be generated by that. And it

195
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:23,040
 seemed quite unlikely and it seems like the likeliest explanation for where the

196
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:26,880
 very first life ever came from. God. Whatever, three and a half billion years ago is

197
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:31,680
 God. And there we go. That is exciting. Wait, this is like the original chicken and egg

198
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:36,480
 really. So what is the answer? The answer is it happened with volcanic

199
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:41,200
 lightning. Which I just think is the coolest moment. It's so basically when

200
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:45,680
 volcanoes erupt then lots and lots of lightning can be generated from the

201
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:48,960
 eruption. It's when all this ash goes up it's a really complicated process.

202
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:52,000
 But basically that ash rubbing against each other makes static electricity.

203
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,720
 And if you look you've got loads and loads of lightning bolts, hundreds of

204
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:57,920
 them in this volcanic eruption. And scientists have looked at the soil

205
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:02,160
 around volcanoes, seen they're full of nitrates which plants can use. And

206
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:07,360
 realise we think this must be how the first life ever was created was when

207
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:12,160
 shed loads of lightning was firing above a volcano as it was erupting and it

208
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:15,840
 allowed nitrogen to get into the soil in a way that could make ice.

209
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:19,440
 That isn't like an origin story I can get behind. I'm so glad it wasn't just

210
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:23,360
 like oh this cell touched this cell and a fish flopped out of a thing and like

211
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:27,040
 all of the other origin stories are so lame. That's like Frankenstein

212
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:31,840
 electricity, evil laughter, lava. So metal.

213
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:34,800
 James you just mentioned the Treaty of Versailles. Yes.

214
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:38,400
 So the Haber-Bosch process is so significant that it was part of the

215
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:40,640
 package of the Treaty of Versailles. No, was it?

216
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:45,840
 The Western powers ordered via the treaty Germany to hand over the secret of

217
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:49,440
 making these fertilisers. Really? That makes sense.

218
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:52,000
 All sorts of stuff they cobbled on to the Treaty of Versailles.

219
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,640
 Crazy shit. We've mentioned it in the past and I can't remember what it was.

220
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:56,880
 Something else that's really random. Champagne.

221
00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:00,080
 They also didn't they want to change the way that orchestras were tuned.

222
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:04,000
 Yeah, yeah. That's it. Like there must have been like and another thing.

223
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:10,800
 It's like having an argument with your partner. Yeah, it starts with something

224
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:13,280
 else and you're like I'm just going to dredge up all these other things.

225
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:18,160
 Yeah, the ultimate argument with a partner. What? What's champagne? Sorry.

226
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:22,080
 Oh, the fact that champagne can only be made in the Champagne region and

227
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:25,920
 anywhere else. It's sparkling wine. That comes from the Treaty of Versailles.

228
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:28,720
 That's it. I didn't know that. Wow. I was thinking like

229
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:32,960
 surely the French already had champagne. The interesting part of that being that

230
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:37,040
 Russia didn't sign it and America didn't sign it and in both those countries

231
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:39,120
 you could buy champagne which isn't from France.

232
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:42,000
 No way. America didn't sign the Treaty of Versailles.

233
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,880
 I think the little known fact, the First World War is still going on.

234
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:48,240
 They had their own treaties. They did.

235
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:51,040
 Do America and Russia have a good culture of champagne?

236
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:53,520
 Are they known for a good champagne anywhere?

237
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:55,920
 California and white wine. Yeah, that's true.

238
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,680
 You must be able to make good champagne out of that.

239
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,120
 Yeah, just sticking Alka-Seltzer in it.

240
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,960
 Bob's your uncle.

241
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:10,080
 Okay, it is time for fact number two and that is Anna.

242
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:14,320
 My fact this week is that Harriet Tubman once walked into a hospital

243
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:18,160
 and asked a doctor to cut her head open and he immediately did.

244
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:26,560
 Just mad. So Harriet Tubman, extremely famous in America, probably less well known about here,

245
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:30,640
 I would say, but you know one of the most influential famous abolitionists ever.

246
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:34,640
 One of the conductors of the Underground Railroad, responsible for smuggling lots of

247
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:39,760
 enslaved people into freedom in the 19th century and one thing that I've learned through reading

248
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:46,240
 about her, she was insanely hardcore. So tough. So and this is just an element of it.

249
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:51,760
 She was very old at the time. She must have been in her 60s or 70s, I think in the 1890s

250
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:57,760
 and late 1890s. She's in Boston and she passed this big building and she asked what it was

251
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:02,640
 and someone said it was a hospital and she thought, "Well, I've had these terrible headaches my whole

252
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:07,520
 life. She really had had awful like headaches and like terrible vision problems. I was probably

253
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:12,480
 disabled by it." So she went right in and she said, "I saw a young man there and I said, 'Sir,

254
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:17,520
 are you a doctor?' And he said he was and then I said, 'Sir, do you think you could cut my head open?'

255
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:23,760
 And he said, 'Lay right down here on this table.' And Son's painkillers, he soared open her skull

256
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:29,680
 and raised it up apparently. And then as she put it, she got up, put on her bonnet and started to

257
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:34,400
 walk home, but her legs did get a bit wobbly and give out under her. So they gave her an ambulance

258
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:38,080
 to take her the rest of the way." It's astonishing. Yeah, sorry, some questions.

259
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:42,000
 When you say he raised up, it isn't like a loft extension of her skull.

260
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:49,440
 Was her brain too big? What is going on? I think this was a slightly questionable

261
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:53,120
 medical procedure, which she said worked and may have been more placebo than much.

262
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:57,840
 She didn't go and say, "My brain is a bit low." My brain's a little bit low in my head.

263
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:03,760
 It's always been my neck. Did she just wrench it? Well, she did say it feels more comfortable now.

264
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:09,520
 Apparently, she yet refused anesthetic, bit of bullet, as they did in the Civil War.

265
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:14,720
 That is actually, I'm afraid, a myth, but it's a very interesting subject you raise, Alex,

266
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:18,640
 because it's the mythology of her life which has been so turned into all these stories.

267
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:21,440
 Because I personally don't believe any of this. It sounds ridiculous.

268
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:25,120
 It's interesting because the more you read, you're like, "That's a great fact." And then you read

269
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:30,080
 again, someone goes, "No, that's a myth." And then a lot of the myths come from relatively

270
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:34,000
 close sources, don't they? Like the first biography I've heard that was written,

271
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,200
 there's loads of myths in there. She never got to write her own. She wanted to write her own.

272
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:41,360
 She never got to. Is it? What, you need to learn to read first, hon? Yeah, that's true.

273
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:52,160
 Have you heard this story? That's why I decided to do a fact about it.

274
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:55,280
 On the reading, did you hear, I imagine this could be in a proctovoltaire as well,

275
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:59,680
 but there's a story that she was many years after all of her time running the Underground Railroad,

276
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:05,760
 that she was on a train and a former master of hers got on. And she was a known figure by that

277
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:09,920
 point. But, and so to avoid being recognized, she grabbed a nearby newspaper and pretended to read

278
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:14,560
 it because she was known for not being able to read. Oh yeah. And then who was on the front cover

279
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:19,280
 of that newspaper? The face was lined up perfectly without the wanted sign here.

280
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:24,720
 No, I think it's probably untrue. Because I've had a different version of it, which is that

281
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:29,360
 when she was on one of her missions, because she left the South where she'd been enslaved and she

282
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:32,240
 went back to free former slaves, and you know, she did a lot of that,

283
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:36,400
 shuttling back forward. But she was back in the South in 1856, and she overheard some men reading

284
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:42,800
 her wanted poster, right, which said clearly she's illiterate, and then she got out of book and

285
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:46,960
 pretended to read it, and the ploy was enough to fool the men. And they were like, she looks just

286
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:50,400
 like Harriet Tubman, but she's reading, so it can't be her. Yeah, yeah, yeah, she's reading a normal

287
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:56,880
 book upside down, but why would you put on the wanted poster that... She can't read,

288
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:04,800
 isn't it? Yeah, exactly. And also, I think the idea that people even knew who she was at the time

289
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:10,880
 is false. So they knew that there was a person who was helping all these enslaved people be freed.

290
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:15,520
 They knew that people were calling them some kind of Moses, because they were free in their people,

291
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:19,760
 but they didn't know anything about her personally, and a lot of people assumed it was a white

292
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:25,360
 abolitionist who was helping enslaved people. But it is interesting, because a lot of the

293
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:28,800
 stuff you read, you just think that can't be true, and it's not to do down her amazing achievements

294
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:34,320
 at all, but it's to show that she's become this unbelievable cult figure. It's almost mythological

295
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:37,840
 with some of the stories around her. Yeah, we've got to tread quite a careful line between slamming

296
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:42,560
 one of the most beloved and famous women in American history, and also sort of ignoring it,

297
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:45,920
 because she does amazing stuff. I find her the most incredible person, one of the most

298
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:50,800
 incredible people ever. I don't have the energy sometimes to finish the research with this podcast,

299
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:55,760
 and this woman, she was very disabled, she was female, she was black, she was enslaved,

300
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:59,520
 just this extraordinary life, and she fought in the Civil War as well. She, after being this

301
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:04,160
 abolitionist hero, she fought in the Civil War, she was incredibly charitable. I don't understand

302
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:10,320
 where she got the energy, and it actually makes me quite angry. Her injury, her disability came

303
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:16,160
 when she was injured by an overseer who threw a stone weight at her head when she was quite young.

304
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:18,640
 He actually threw it at someone else, they're thinking it missed and hit her.

305
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:23,360
 Is that right? Yeah. Oh, that's bad luck. But yeah, she had sleeping spells quite often,

306
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:28,400
 so she would just kind of fall asleep, what we'd probably call narcolepsy today. But she would have

307
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:32,080
 like these kind of hazy dreams while she was asleep, and because she was very religious,

308
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:38,000
 she thought they were kind of premonitions from God. It's quite stressful, the idea, let's say

309
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:43,040
 you've been enslaved, Harriet Tubman's come back, she's freed you, she's guiding you to the north,

310
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:49,520
 and then she just falls asleep. It's a bit of a comedy scene.

311
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:55,280
 There is sick or potential in this life, is what I'm saying. I think that might be the first time

312
00:22:55,280 --> 00:23:00,880
 ever someone said there's sick or potential in Harriet Tubman's life. She went back, she freed,

313
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:05,920
 and the numbers vary, so she rescued 60 or 70 people herself personally, and then she gave

314
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:11,280
 instructions to another 70 odd, and that got slightly inflated to 300. But she did go back,

315
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:17,040
 I mean, between about around 10 times, she made a mission back into the south, which was really

316
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:21,280
 perilous. She also went back at one point to go free her husband, who she'd left, came back, found

317
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:26,480
 that he'd remarried, and there's a line which, again, is probably just a biographer, sort of like

318
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:30,960
 she thought about making a scene, but then decided against it and rescued him anyway. But it's like

319
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:34,800
 the idea again of like the sort of two minutes where she's deciding whether to massively kick

320
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:39,520
 off another woman or to save you. Well, he didn't need to be rescued per se, because he was not

321
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:46,720
 enslaved, he was a free man. Which was kind of a big deal at the time, because a free man marrying

322
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:52,320
 an enslaved woman, you would lose a lot of your rights, because all your children would be automatically

323
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:57,440
 enslaved, you wouldn't be able to get married unless you had permission of the woman's master,

324
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:03,120
 as they called them. Yeah, so that was quite a big deal, but yeah, like you say, once she was off

325
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:08,480
 doing her gallivanting, he was like, "No, I'm just going to find another wife now." Again, the sitcom

326
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:15,440
 is taking shape. One sweet thing I do like is that when she retired eventually, she retired

327
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:19,920
 into a retirement home that she had founded. So she, in 1908, she opened the Harriet Tubman

328
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:25,440
 Home for the elderly, specifically for like, indigent and aged African Americans, as it was

329
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:29,040
 described. Are we sure they didn't misunderstand? And she said, "No, I called it the Harriet Tubman

330
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:36,320
 Home because it's just a home for Harriet." Here's another good thing. Okay, this is good, and I'm

331
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:41,200
 pretty sure this is true as well. So on the missions, when she was taking people over to the north,

332
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:46,240
 she would sing, right, and there were particular songs, and some people say she would sing things

333
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:49,600
 like "Swing, Loves, Sweet, Harriet," but that hadn't been written yet. But she was very ahead of

334
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:57,120
 us. She was, yeah. So there were songs called "Go Down Moses" and "Bound for the Promised Land,"

335
00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:01,120
 right, and those were real songs, which she did sing at the time. And this is a cool thing,

336
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:05,920
 she would change the tempo of the songs to indicate whether it was safe to come out or not,

337
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:10,400
 so she would just be walking along singing. But the way she was singing was a message to the

338
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:15,360
 people she was ferrying north. Does that mean, like, you know, if everything's going well and

339
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:19,840
 they need to run, does she like go dill-a-dill-a-dill-a-dill-a-dill-a-dill? And then if they needed

340
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:24,000
 to be slower, she would just do it. And if she stopped singing completely, she's fallen asleep.

341
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:30,080
 I was looking into possibly what kind of brain surgery she had, and then I went on a bit of a

342
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:36,640
 journey and found a really fascinating syndrome, which I cannot believe we have never spoken about

343
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:41,600
 before. And I feel like we might have it, actually. This is the... It's called Forster syndrome,

344
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:46,320
 or also known as Witzel sucked, and it's the pathological urge to constantly make puns.

345
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:51,040
 Witzel sucked. I had that for a while. Witzel sucked.

346
00:25:53,760 --> 00:26:01,200
 Somebody get a doctor. Fucking hell. So this was first noted in 1929 by a German urologist called

347
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:05,840
 Ottfried Forster, who is named after. He was operating on a patient to remove a tumour,

348
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:09,600
 and the patient was awake, as often happens, as was the case with Harriet Tubman.

349
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:15,120
 And as he started moving around this tumour, the man suddenly, he was face down strapped to the

350
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:19,680
 table. He suddenly just started talking manically, and just like making pun after pun, they were

351
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:23,440
 all basically... I hardly even met him. Literally that. It was literally all about knives and

352
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:26,640
 surgery, and he'd obviously, because that was what was on his mind, because he was having brain

353
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:31,280
 surgery. Literally what was on his mind, actually. Exactly. Jesus, guys, can you stop?

354
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:38,720
 Absolutely fascinating. And then there'd be more recent examples of this. There was a man a few

355
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:43,360
 years ago. We just know his name is Derek, because he was anonymous, but he had a couple of strokes,

356
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:46,560
 and his behaviour changed in many ways. He used to try and compulsively recycle stuff and things

357
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:50,400
 like that. And he started waking up his wife in the middle of the night, being like, "I've

358
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:53,760
 just come up with another pun." And eventually his wife was like, "Why didn't you start writing

359
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:57,440
 down?" And not telling me. But eventually realised that this was like a pathological

360
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:02,240
 behaviour change. And the interesting other side effect is this, is that it's a really simple,

361
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:09,280
 basic humour, like basic pun connections, basic, really basic jokes. There's a lot of skill involved.

362
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:13,120
 Neurologists studied this, and they showed them more complex joke patterns. They didn't

363
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:16,480
 find them funny at all. And it's something to do with that really basic pleasure of making

364
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:20,320
 their connection in your head. But they also didn't find other people's jokes funny at all.

365
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:26,240
 That's basically every comedian, isn't it? Another thing about Tubman is that she did get

366
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:30,560
 famed by the end of her life and was recognisable. And a bunch of receptions were put on in her honour

367
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:35,680
 in the 1890s. They were put on in Boston, and she didn't live there. She had to get a train.

368
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:41,120
 But to pay for the train ticket, she had to sell one for cows. So in order to get to a bunch of

369
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:46,960
 receptions thrown in her honour, where she was the star guest, she sold her cow to get the train.

370
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:50,080
 I think she spent so much of her life, different parts of her life in poverty,

371
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:54,000
 just because she just gave away so much stuff. And when she rescued people from slavery,

372
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:58,720
 she used to then follow through and like get them jobs and like set them up in the new places

373
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:02,080
 that they did. She didn't just like get them somewhere and be like, "See ya." She did a lot

374
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:07,200
 of cooking too. And that was relevant because she raised a lot of money for the missions by cooking,

375
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:11,760
 basically. And there was a really interesting piece about this sort of facet of a life on NPR.

376
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:16,400
 So she was once at a market, she came face to face with a former sort of slave overseer,

377
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:21,120
 basically. And she was holding two chickens, right? Oh yeah. What did she do? She pretended to read

378
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:27,120
 the chickens, brilliant. She said, "Oh, looks like there's three cocks in the room."

379
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:33,600
 Very sassy. We're going in the pilot script. She shoved her head into a chicken and to disguise

380
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:38,000
 herself as a chicken. Hit him with a chicken. She threw eggs at him. She released one of the

381
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:43,680
 chickens and then pretended to chase it, causing a comic kerfuffle. Ironically, by drawing attention

382
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:47,520
 to herself, she deflected attention from herself. Again, another scene in the sitcom. That's what

383
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:53,200
 happens in Mr Bean's holiday. He chases a chicken for like 40 minutes. Comedy gold. That's the clever

384
00:28:53,200 --> 00:29:01,200
 girl, the beanographer. I do love Mr Bean. So there's a link between her and Queen Victoria,

385
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:06,960
 which I find interesting. So in 1897, Queen Victoria sent her a shawl to sort of mark her

386
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:11,120
 amazing work. Yeah, it was a gift. Yeah, a gift. Yeah, yeah. But I thought I could do a little

387
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:18,640
 quiz for you now. Brilliant. Who was taller? Queen Victoria or Harriet Tubman? Ooh, good one.

388
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:23,200
 Well, Queen Victoria was no more than five foot. I think perhaps less, four foot, 11 feet. She was

389
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:27,040
 famously quite short. Famously short. I believe famously her circumference ended up being more

390
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:31,440
 than her height at the end of her life. Does this help us with Tubman, though? Tubman's got to be

391
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:35,280
 taller. I know she was on the small side. I think she's going to be smaller because it's not a fun

392
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:41,680
 quiz because Queen Victoria was quite short. I think the fun ship has sailed. I'm going to say,

393
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:46,320
 I think Tubman was an inch taller. I reckon she was five foot on the dot. I'm going to say they're

394
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:52,480
 exactly the same height. Brilliant. I'm going to say Tubman was an inch shorter. Well, Anna's closest.

395
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:59,760
 Tubman was four foot, 11. Oh, Queen Victoria. Now, James, I have read, I went down a real rabbit

396
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:04,880
 hole. I'm sure you're right. Basically, we know there's a surviving tape measure kept by a portraitist

397
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:10,560
 in 1837. My God. Which shows she was five foot one because she had been Victoria. I mean, not Tubman,

398
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:15,200
 but Queen Victoria had been claimed to be five foot two and they boosted her height by an inch.

399
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:19,120
 Obviously, it would be ridiculous to say she's five foot 10 and, you know, really leggy. Maybe

400
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:23,760
 she was wearing heels. Basically, they were a bit embarrassed, the Royal Family, that she was only

401
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:28,880
 five foot one because it made it seem like she hadn't been fed well in childhood and, you know,

402
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:32,880
 she didn't like the taller children tend to be better fed. They boosted her height, sort of her

403
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:38,560
 public height to five foot two so that she would seem a bit better. But the portraitist had the

404
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:44,240
 receipts. What I think is interesting is that this means approximately that Queen Victoria was

405
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:49,440
 about the same height as Sandy Tuxwig and Harriet Tubman was about the same height as Susan Kalman.

406
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:55,600
 Yes. So if we need people in your sitcom of Tubman. I think that's some problematic casting there.

407
00:30:55,600 --> 00:31:00,160
 If you're saying Susan Kalman for the role of Harriet Tubman. I do see that now, yeah.

408
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:13,200
 Okay, time now for fact number three and that is James. Okay. My fact this week is that Wasabi

409
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:20,480
 is good on sushi rolls and papyrus scrolls. Lovely. I beg to differ, personally.

410
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:25,840
 What? Never tasted papyrus and yet I reckon I know it's not good. With or without Wasabi.

411
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:34,000
 Well, we come to the fact itself. He's worded it humorously. I wouldn't say that's even humorous.

412
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:40,800
 It's just a rhyme. Lyrically. You've worded it misleadingly in the hope of humor.

413
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:46,640
 It charmed me. I found it amusing. It is not misleading at all. So it's good on sushi rolls

414
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:50,560
 because it tastes good, in my opinion. And there are other reasons that we might come to.

415
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:56,160
 Papyrus scrolls though is the main interesting part, which is this new technique of looking

416
00:31:56,160 --> 00:32:02,960
 after papyrus. Now there is a problem that because papyrus is made from plants, it can fall victim to

417
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:09,680
 fungal infections and the fungus can damage the papyrus and it can cause the paints to fade and

418
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:15,440
 stuff like that. And so there has been a study in the Journal of Archaeological Science which has

419
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:24,080
 put some Wasabi vapours onto the papyrus and these smells kill off the funguses or rather

420
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:28,160
 stop the funguses from growing very well and they don't get rid of the colour so you can still read

421
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:33,600
 them. And yeah, this is a lot safer and better for the environment than what you might use before,

422
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:39,120
 which is chemicals. It's super noninvasive because they just put the Wasabi near the

423
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:44,880
 papyrus. Yeah, yeah. What I really like in this study is that they didn't want to use actual,

424
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:49,760
 you know, ancient Egyptians and papyruses, but they wanted to see if it worked on something

425
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:53,760
 like that. So they did exactly what you would do at primary school, which is heat it up some

426
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:58,400
 papyrus to make it look like it was really old. You know, like you might do if you're making a

427
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:05,120
 pirate map at school. Yeah, they did it in tea. They made new papyrus. They made new papyrus.

428
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:10,560
 Aged it up fast. They aged it fast by heating it up. That's so clever. Yeah. And then they mixed

429
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:15,280
 water and Wasabi, almost like if you mix your Wasabi with soy sauce, that kind of, you know,

430
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:20,640
 and after the end of the process, you've got a snack. Yeah, exactly. I'm less worried about

431
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:25,680
 wasting papyrus on this process and more worried about wasting good Wasabi on this process.

432
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:32,640
 It's very precious Wasabi. It's very hard to make, isn't it? It's hard to obtain it and they're

433
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:37,760
 just like steaming away Wasabi at papyrus. And isn't most Wasabi not real Wasabi? I mean, I've

434
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:41,680
 probably never had real Wasabi. I didn't think I've ever had real Wasabi. No, it's most in Japan

435
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:46,560
 though. You must have done. I have been, but I read that even in Japan, a lot of it is... I believe

436
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:51,200
 most of it in Japan. It's horse radish. What if I went to a really nice restaurant in Japan?

437
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:56,000
 You're probably fine. Would it be? I think 5 or 10% of Wasabi served in Japan is real Wasabi.

438
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:01,040
 Really? But in the West, it's like 1% is real Wasabi. It's really... And it's all horse radish.

439
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:05,440
 It's all dying. And horse radish is really strong. But I think Wasabi is a bit gentler and a bit more

440
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:11,040
 interestingly delicate and a bit more flavoursome. So that's what I read. Yeah. Yeah. And a bit...

441
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:15,600
 You can tell if you've got real stuff because it should be a bit grittier. Also, I didn't

442
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:21,520
 realise that you need to eat it immediately as soon as it's been grated because it loses its zing.

443
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:26,320
 So essentially you... Sometimes they bring the root to the table and a grater and you grate it

444
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:30,640
 fresh onto your food. I think I prefer the horse radish. If the real Wasabi is bland and

445
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:34,160
 gritty and you have to have it immediately fresher, it goes off even more. No one said

446
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:38,240
 bland. I just want to say if there are any chefs out there... Oh, Alex said bland. We didn't say

447
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:43,280
 bland. I don't believe delicate. And the other thing... The other reason Wasabi is good on sushi

448
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:48,960
 rolls, so not just because it tastes good, but also because it has antimicrobial properties.

449
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:54,720
 So as well as stopping funguses from growing, it can stop bacteria from growing. And it has

450
00:34:54,720 --> 00:35:01,440
 something in there called six-methyl sulfinylhexyl isothiocyanate, which stops E. coli,

451
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:05,760
 staphylococcus, and salmonella from growing. Really? Yeah. Sounds like we should be taking

452
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:11,200
 baths in it or something. It would be good for us as an auntie. I think even the delicate Wasabi,

453
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:17,040
 if you have a bath in it, is going to get right up your nose. Yeah. And it will cost you a fair few,

454
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:21,840
 Bob. But you could put a bit in your shoes and stop fungal infection. You could go for a bath

455
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:26,160
 and onsen in Japan, and maybe someone could come over and just grate a little bit of Wasabi.

456
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:31,840
 That would be so lovely. Yeah, that's luxurious. You can look it. Sorry? You can look it and you

457
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:38,880
 won't taste the spice. Oh. So there's no point in looking it? No, unless you don't like spicy food,

458
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:42,800
 but you want to eat Wasabi, in which case just lick it, and then you won't get the spice,

459
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:47,040
 but you'll have touched Wasabi with your tongue. If you have fungus or microbes on your tongue.

460
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:51,280
 Yes. Yes. That's a good point. I think that should work. In fact, and it's a lot like how

461
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:57,200
 lightning can split up nitrate. So by grating Wasabi, think of the greater as the lightning,

462
00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:02,720
 that splits up the Wasabi plant, and it splits up its cells. What a torture. How laboured, yeah.

463
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:07,600
 I feel like I could have understood it without any of the previous callback.

464
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:11,840
 Is that what creates the flavour? It breaks up the cells and creates the flavour exactly.

465
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:16,480
 How does Wasabi work? Well, let me take you back to the dawn of the universe.

466
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:21,520
 Did you know horse radish is poisonous to horses? No.

467
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:28,160
 So they don't know why it's called that, but I actually like both options. So the word horse

468
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:32,880
 radish first appeared in 1597 in English. People think it might be because it resembles a horse's

469
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:38,320
 genitalia. It speaks of a time when more people are familiar with what horses' knackers look like.

470
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:46,800
 You know, I could probably draw you one, but I would probably control them and push if I had to.

471
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:52,480
 You know, absolutely no. You could do an amazing shaded sketch. So it's either genitals, horse

472
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:57,520
 radish, because they do look a bit like their, horse radish is like a moolly. I mean, that's

473
00:36:57,520 --> 00:37:01,920
 probably less. What's a moolly? It's like a long white radish, right? I don't know that.

474
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:05,280
 It looks like a long white root. Is that what a moolly is? Yeah. Are they really big?

475
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:09,120
 Yeah. It's probably, I would say, how big is that? About foot long? No, it looks pretty normal.

476
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:12,160
 I think your moolly, Simone, might have been up there with my confusing lightning

477
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:16,560
 making things clearer. What's a moolly? A moolly is like a large radish.

478
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:20,640
 Like a horse radish? Yeah. All right, they're similar. I understand. I can see it's going

479
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:24,240
 round in circles. I genuinely thought people would know what a moolly looked like. Yeah.

480
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:29,200
 Okay, fine. What's the other option, Anna? Well remembered. Thanks, James. It's because, so in

481
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:33,440
 German, you might, so you might be able to guess if I tell you that in German, a horse radish is

482
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:39,120
 called 'Mierritich', to mean sea radish, actually. Oh. Not to be confused with the sea radish,

483
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:43,600
 which is a different plant. I know, because it looks like a seahorse is genitalia.

484
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:47,760
 Yeah, very nice. You're miles off. In the older days, everyone knew what that looked like.

485
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:51,280
 Because we all rode seahorses throughout town, didn't we?

486
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:57,520
 What grows in the sea? It looks like a radish. It's more about pronunciation. It's about the

487
00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:03,040
 pronunciation. So when we were translating it into English, we heard 'merradisch'. Oh, 'mer', as in

488
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:08,640
 like the 'mer' as in a female horse. As in a horse. Yeah. Let me give you another reason why it might

489
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:13,840
 be called that. Albertus Magnus was writing in the 13th century, and he discussed horse radish.

490
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:18,240
 He just called it 'radish', but he suggested it as a treatment for constipation in horses.

491
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:24,640
 So it could be that we kind of heard the 'mer' thought we use it for constipation in

492
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:30,400
 horses anyway. And so maybe that's why we call it horse radish. Is it up the bottom?

493
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:35,280
 It didn't say. Albertus Magnus didn't say. He just said it's useful constipation in horses.

494
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:40,240
 It might have been up the bum, because there's another thing called rathanidosis,

495
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:48,160
 which is a punishment in ancient Greece of inserting the root of a radish up the bum

496
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:53,360
 as a punishment for adultery. Now, we don't know what kind of radish that was.

497
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:57,040
 It probably wasn't one of those little red ones that you get in saints.

498
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:57,920
 That's the first offence.

499
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:04,320
 But if it was horse radish, for instance, then that would be much more of a punishment,

500
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:09,920
 because you're going to get that kind of wasabi burning up the bum, as well as having

501
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:13,360
 something that's the size of a mooly going up your bum. Not the size of a mooly.

502
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:17,680
 I bet there was one person who got really turned on by it.

503
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:24,480
 I bet there was one example where someone was like, "Oh, no, my adulterated again. Get the hammer."

504
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:34,000
 Here's the thing on papyrus. Right. Oh, my goodness. Okay. Have you, right.

505
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:40,960
 You know the Library of Alexandria? Yes. Okay. Ancient Egypt founded in the 295 BC.

506
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:43,440
 They had a copy of every book, or they were trying to get one.

507
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:47,840
 So the Ptolemies with the pharaohs at the time, they're all called Ptolemy basically,

508
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:51,760
 and they would hunt for manuscripts everywhere, right? And they would send out,

509
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:55,280
 if a pharaoh ship sailed into Alexandria, it was searched for scrolls,

510
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:58,000
 and then they'd be confiscated and copied out and then given back.

511
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:03,520
 And all this was on papyrus, right? And the Nile Valley was the center of the written word,

512
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:09,840
 because papyrus grew on the banks of the Nile. So the Ptolemies have basically a control supply.

513
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:16,880
 And then there's this rival library that sets up. King Eumenes of Pergamon founds a rival library,

514
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:21,440
 the Library of Pergamon. And Pergamon was huge at the time. It was a big kingdom, like massive.

515
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:27,680
 Turkey. Modern-day Turkey. And more. You know, there was a big deal of Pergamites, I don't know.

516
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:32,640
 Anyway, basically, talk about the sitcom potential. There's the spell in history.

517
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:35,200
 We're from the makers of Harriet Tubman, exclamation mark.

518
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:42,080
 There's the spell in history where both libraries are trying to secure every book on the planet,

519
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:46,640
 and they are bidding huge wages for scholars, like Premier League footballers for scholars,

520
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:51,120
 and scribes. Some scholars are imprisoned so they can't run off to the other library.

521
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:57,120
 And then the huge move happens. Ptolemy V takes the rivalry to a new level about 100 years after

522
00:40:57,120 --> 00:41:03,440
 the founding. He bans the export of papyrus. Huge move. Out. That's cheesy, isn't it?

523
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:05,520
 Eat it, Pergamon. I was like taking the football off the pitch.

524
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:10,400
 It basically is. You can't make any scrolls. You can't copy any manuscripts. We own literature.

525
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:15,040
 So what did Pergamon do? Well, he... Invented paper?

526
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:18,720
 Yes, he must have invented paper. The audio book. He invented the audio book.

527
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:25,920
 They started manufacturing parchment from the skin of animals, and parchment literally means

528
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:31,440
 from Pergamon. That's the etymology way. That's so cool. And the thing about parchment is you can

529
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:35,840
 cut it up in layers, and you don't need to roll it in a scroll, which is incredibly inefficient.

530
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:39,680
 You can have pages. You can have pages. That's so interesting.

531
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:45,200
 It's where parchment already existed, but they, as it were, put a lot of manufacturing behind it

532
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:51,520
 and made it bigger. And the book is better than the scroll. Wow. The pen is mightier than the sword.

533
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:54,480
 And the book is better than the scroll. Do you know what, Andy? I'm going to come out and say it.

534
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:58,880
 That etymology is even more interesting than the horse genitalia. Well done.

535
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:00,160
 Wow. Strug disagree.

536
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:11,760
 Okay, it's time for our final fact, and that is my fact. My fact this week is that bees smell

537
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:15,280
 like bananas when they get angry. I've never seen an angry banana.

538
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:23,520
 So, I think this is just a weird coincidence, really. Bees use pheromones a lot to communicate.

539
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:28,960
 They release different chemicals, which other bees can smell. One of the pheromones that they

540
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:33,200
 release is a distress or alarm signal. And maybe there's a predator. One of their bees is in trouble.

541
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:40,160
 Makes them really angry, too. And one of the chemicals in this pheromone is called isoamyl acetate.

542
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:45,760
 And that also happens to be the chemical which is banana flavour.

543
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:49,600
 Yeah. Can I just say it? Mostly, because I think people often say, what you would know

544
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:53,600
 is banana flavour is actually this very specific banana thing. Most people know banana flavour

545
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:57,600
 from actual bananas, right? I mean, I don't have that many banana flavour things.

546
00:42:57,600 --> 00:43:03,280
 Have more people eaten bananas or eaten a banana flavoured Angel Delight, maybe?

547
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:08,720
 I could go out there and say more people have eaten bananas than banana flavoured Angel Delight.

548
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:10,880
 Well, that's because bananas have an entrenched advantage, you know.

549
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:13,520
 Arguably, banana flavoured Angel Delight is better than a banana.

550
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:16,080
 If it grew on trees. Exactly, yeah.

551
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:20,320
 But you have hit the point that artificial banana flavouring today

552
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:23,840
 is not quite the same as the bananas we eat today. And you have mentioned this on the podcast

553
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:28,720
 before, and there was a previous species of banana or strain of banana called the Groming

554
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:34,160
 Shell banana, which used to be all around the world. I think it's still around in Thailand

555
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:37,840
 somewhere, but it's not commercially really available or used. It was like nearly completely

556
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:41,040
 wiped out, if not completely wiped out. Just by the Angel Delight market.

557
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:46,640
 So, we haven't dished bananas now, I think. And they're supposed to be less tasteful.

558
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:52,400
 And so, actually, the slightly tangier, stronger artificial banana flavour in those tiny sweets

559
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:54,640
 that we get. And that's the one that you get from the bees.

560
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:57,760
 The bees, yes. And people, it is a renowned thing in the bee community.

561
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:02,640
 I was messaging Liz, who is one of our colleagues who's been at QI longer than all of us, in fact.

562
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:05,760
 And she's a beekeeper as well. And Liz.

563
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:14,720
 Unbelievable. She says, yes, sometimes you will enter the hive and there's a real banana stench.

564
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:17,280
 Is there, really? And they don't go near a hive with a banana.

565
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:20,480
 Is the other thing to do? Is it a noether? Yeah, absolutely.

566
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:24,080
 Because they'll think it's a, they'll remind them it's a large bee.

567
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:27,280
 Yeah. Especially if you paint black stripes on the banana.

568
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:31,520
 I think it's the equivalent of walking into a hive with a big sign that just says,

569
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:35,600
 "I killed your friends." Don't also go to a bee hive with a pregnant mouse.

570
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:41,360
 So, pregnant mice smell like bananas. They do.

571
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:47,280
 Yeah, they do. It's a scent that they give off. And it also stresses out male mice.

572
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:50,800
 I so am all acetate. These smell of a pregnant female mouse.

573
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:52,160
 Yeah, it does. It stresses out males.

574
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:57,200
 Yeah, because mice are often cannibals and they will eat baby mice.

575
00:44:57,200 --> 00:45:02,960
 But not if you make yourself smell like a banana. The males will go, "Ugh,

576
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:05,120
 I'm not going near that." And they won't eat your children.

577
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:09,120
 That's so ironic. They won't eat you if you make yourself smell like a banana.

578
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:12,320
 Kind of a fox out well, is it, but you're like, "Mmm, delicious children. Oh, it's got banana on it."

579
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:17,760
 I didn't know the range of pheromones that bees use.

580
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:19,440
 There's so many. There's a massive list online, yeah.

581
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:26,160
 There's extraordinary weird things that they can do. So, for example, the queen, there was a

582
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:30,640
 great after... She used to have bees. She smells a banana. Queen Lizzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz.

583
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:37,840
 I found a piece on this from 2014. I just want to give a shout out to Luke Holman on the

584
00:45:37,840 --> 00:45:40,480
 conversation. I don't know if you were at the headline, but it was called "Smells like Queen

585
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:47,360
 Spirit." It's fantastic. So, queen bees, they broadcast data via pheromones to the rest of the

586
00:45:47,360 --> 00:45:51,840
 hive. And one of the things is to say they are the queen. That just communicates, you know,

587
00:45:51,840 --> 00:45:57,440
 clear leadership in place. Another is whether or not they are mated and have been mating around,

588
00:45:57,440 --> 00:46:02,000
 and also how well mated they are. So, they have pheromones to release to say how many males they've

589
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:08,000
 had sex with. Imagine if our queen did that. It would be so funny. He's opening a school and you're like, "Oh!"

590
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:15,680
 More promiscuous queens are better for the colony because they provide a bit more genetic diversity,

591
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:20,080
 and that keeps the colony nice and healthy. But was every queen has to... I was reading

592
00:46:20,080 --> 00:46:24,000
 this interesting thing about how you introduce a queen to a colony. If you just take your queen

593
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:28,320
 and plonk it in, the bees will kill it because she's got the wrong pheromones. She's from another

594
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:33,680
 hive, and the worker bees need a chance to get used to her. So, the way that you do it is that

595
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:39,200
 you have a box, and you put this box in the hive, and the doorway to the box is sealed up with

596
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:42,560
 sugar, basically. The bees eat through it, and it takes them a while, but it means that they end

597
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:46,320
 up being quite close to the queen who's sitting inside the little box, waiting to be released

598
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:51,360
 from the box. And so, the time it takes for the bees to eat through the sugar, they can smell

599
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:54,320
 the queen on the other side, and they get used to her, and then they don't want to kill her.

600
00:46:54,320 --> 00:46:59,920
 So, it's like she burst out of a cake. She actually does, yes. That is exactly how every new queen

601
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:07,040
 is introduced to a beehive. Another use of isoamyl acetate is to make fake bananas,

602
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:13,200
 and this happens during World War II. Let's say we've stopped any poo get to Germany, and they've

603
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:17,280
 said, "Right, well, you're not having any bananas then." And so, you can't get any bananas there,

604
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:23,440
 so you have to make fake ones, and they made mock bananas by using parsnips. They would get some

605
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:30,240
 parsnips. They would add some isoamyl acetate, which was available banana essence, essentially,

606
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:35,520
 literally, essentially, and they would eat them. And apparently, there was a modern-day blogger

607
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:41,520
 called Carolyn Ecken who recreated it and said, "It's a rather strange and bizarre taste, but not

608
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:48,880
 unpleasant, although there is an aftertaste of parsnip." I think it's so tragic. The idea of,

609
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:53,520
 like, mash up your parsnips adds to the show. That was the war. Bananas. Yeah, no, it really was.

610
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:58,560
 When a queen bee dies, she stops releasing the pheromones that she's been using to keep the

611
00:47:58,560 --> 00:48:04,080
 colony happy and placid, and this causes a big reaction, and the workers basically get going

612
00:48:04,080 --> 00:48:09,440
 on an emergency queen. So, this is really interesting. They build these huge queen-sized

613
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:16,000
 chambers, like queen-sized bedrooms, effectively, and they get 10 to 20 candidates, workers,

614
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:19,680
 and they start feeding them royal jelly, and they find out who becomes the queen.

615
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:24,000
 That sounds like a reality format. It actually is, and the first one to emerge kills all the others,

616
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:29,360
 and then begins to lay eggs. We're megabars, the ethics committee, the BBC, I don't think.

617
00:48:29,360 --> 00:48:40,560
 There is only one pheromone which two dung beetles share, okay? So, most dung beetles have their own

618
00:48:40,560 --> 00:48:47,760
 pheromones, but there's one that's shared by both of them and it's called anisole. Where do they release

619
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:56,400
 it from? It comes because it smells a bit like anise, like star anise. Oh, that is the name that

620
00:48:56,400 --> 00:49:01,600
 works. I'm sure brilliantly in the French market. Isn't there a whole thing where beavers anal glands

621
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:08,880
 are the origin of an awful lot of chemicals, flavours including vanilla and strawberry,

622
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:12,480
 raspberry flavouring. They're not necessarily used anymore, because I think it's still quite rare

623
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:17,520
 and expensive, and also people don't really want that on. Only 5% of strawberry angel delights,

624
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:23,200
 actually. Beaver anal gland juice, sadly. And if I went to really nice restaurants, I did really

625
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:42,320
 get finger anal gland juice. Can you guys smell ants? Oh my god, the ant detector's going off.

626
00:49:42,320 --> 00:49:45,600
 Everyone line up, pick up something much heavier than you and pile out of the building.

627
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:53,200
 I'm not asking right now. I'm saying in general, if there were some ants on the

628
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:57,200
 table, do you think you'd be able to smell them? I've never, no, I don't think I would.

629
00:49:57,200 --> 00:50:02,000
 Yeah, so the interesting thing is that this is a thing that people have said on the internet.

630
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:05,920
 A lot of people have said, "Oh, I can smell ants." And then other people have said, "You can't smell

631
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:10,240
 ants." And then there's been big arguments. It's not like the internet to argue over something

632
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:17,280
 completely pointless, but IFL science, which we all love that website, they carried out a Twitter poll

633
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:23,520
 and they found that 20% of respondents claim that they can detect the odor of an ant

634
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:29,760
 compared to 80% who can't. Ants are heavily dependent on ferriments. Were 20% of respondents

635
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:36,000
 ants? I don't know. Well, we don't know exactly. I think one thing we can say is that this is not

636
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:40,960
 a particularly scientific survey. Right. But let's say, for instance, if it's true, there are various

637
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:45,680
 different reasons that it might be true. It could be that some people have a certain gene that allows

638
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:51,360
 them to smell ants. Like you can smell asparagus we, some people can, some people can't. It could

639
00:50:51,360 --> 00:50:56,240
 be that some ants smell and the ones that live in certain areas smell and the ones that live in

640
00:50:56,240 --> 00:50:59,840
 certain areas don't smell. And that's the responses we've got, but we don't know.

641
00:50:59,840 --> 00:51:02,880
 Well, they're living in smelly areas and we're smelling other things and it's covering them up.

642
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:07,040
 Could be. If I'm in the ground floor of John Lewis, like I'm not going to smell an ant because

643
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:12,400
 it's in the perfume section. Yeah, absolutely. So if all of the UK smelly ants live in perfume

644
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:17,280
 sections of John Lewis, we would never smell them. It's a very relatable comparison point.

645
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:21,600
 It's just something, it's a bugbear of mine because I like going to John Lewis.

646
00:51:21,600 --> 00:51:26,320
 I nearly pass out every time I go in. You have to sort of... Oh, I love all the perfume section

647
00:51:26,320 --> 00:51:31,280
 in the pub and store. I really like it. I really like going in an airport and trying out all the

648
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:36,480
 samples. Yeah, me too. And then getting on the plane and really offending everyone.

649
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:42,400
 You've never tried that. I should do it. You should do it. As you go through that winding bit.

650
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:45,360
 As you go through the G3, there's loads of free samples. That's another bit I hate because it

651
00:51:45,360 --> 00:51:49,520
 smells so awful, as in so strong and it gives me headaches. So you've already got quite a sense

652
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:57,040
 to set up pipes. Yeah, there's definitely an ant in this room. Quite a lot of hotels have got cameras

653
00:51:57,040 --> 00:52:04,080
 in the bedrooms these days, in the beds in fact. What? What's this? What? Be hotels.

654
00:52:04,080 --> 00:52:10,080
 Here we go. So this is something called the spotter gadget. It's got loads of pheromones in it

655
00:52:10,080 --> 00:52:16,080
 and a tiny camera and you put it in a hotel bed and the pheromones attract bed bugs.

656
00:52:16,080 --> 00:52:20,320
 And then when the bed bugs go into where the pheromones are, the tiny camera takes a photo

657
00:52:20,320 --> 00:52:24,800
 of the bed bugs and sends it off to someone who looks at it and goes, "Yes, that's a bed bug."

658
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:31,520
 And then if they say, "Yes, it's definitely a bed bug," then it means that you have to go

659
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:37,840
 in and fumigate it. Yeah, it is exterminated. So these are in hotel rooms, but can the camera

660
00:52:37,840 --> 00:52:41,680
 capture anything else that's happening in the hotel room? If your penis is the size of a bed bug.

661
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:50,080
 Oh dear. That perhaps. It was just drawn with that little tube, I didn't know, I didn't know.
