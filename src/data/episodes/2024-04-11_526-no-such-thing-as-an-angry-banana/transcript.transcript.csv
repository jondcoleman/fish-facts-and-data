00:00:00,00:00:03,"Hi everybody, Andy here. Just before we start this week's show I have a little"
00:00:03,00:00:08,announcement to make. We're in Plug Corner because I have written a book. I
00:00:08,00:00:13,"have offended again against all the people who say don't, don't do another"
00:00:13,00:00:17,"one, just stop at two and I've written a third one and this one for the first time"
00:00:17,00:00:22,ever I've written something that is fun and funny as well as being gripping. It's
00:00:22,00:00:26,called a beginner's guide to breaking and entering. It's about a young man
00:00:26,00:00:31,called Al who lives in gorgeous empty second homes while the real owners are
00:00:31,00:00:35,away. He's got a whole set of rules to help him get into these beautiful houses
00:00:35,00:00:39,he could never afford to live in. He has a great life until about chapter 3 when
00:00:39,00:00:42,"he and his friends break into the wrong house on the wrong day, somebody ends up"
00:00:42,00:00:47,"dead and everything goes wrong from there. It's funny, it's gripping, it's"
00:00:47,00:00:50,pacy. There's a little bit of a message about housing in there. It's a perfect
00:00:50,00:00:54,"summer read, people have been really nice about it. Val McDermid, Lisa Joule, some of"
00:00:54,00:00:58,the Queens of Crime have been incredibly kind about it. It's out on the 25th of
00:00:58,00:01:02,April so if you order it now you will be among the first cohort globally to
00:01:02,00:01:05,receive your gorgeous copy and they're really nice looking copies. Please do
00:01:05,00:01:09,"pre-order it, it can really be the difference between a book flying and"
00:01:09,00:01:12,not flying if it has a few pre-orders under its belt before that crucial first
00:01:12,00:01:17,"week. It's out in all good bookshops, it's out in all bad bookshops, it's in most bookshops"
00:01:17,00:01:20,in the Commonwealth basically. All you need to do is go in and say I would like
00:01:20,00:01:23,a copy of a beginner's guide to breaking and entering by Andrew Hunter Murray.
00:01:23,00:01:26,Waterstones even have signed copies if you'd like to get a hold of one of those.
00:01:26,00:01:30,"I promise it's good, I've put a lot into it, I'm gonna stop banging on about it"
00:01:30,00:01:33,now. It's called a beginner's guide to breaking and entering. Thanks very much for
00:01:33,00:01:36,listening to this. On with the podcast!
00:01:50,00:01:55,"Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast"
00:01:55,00:02:00,coming to you from the Kiwai offices in Hobon. My name is Alex Bell and I'm
00:02:00,00:02:05,"joined by Anna Shusinski, Andrew Hunter Murray and James Harkin and once again we"
00:02:05,00:02:08,are gathered around the microphone to share our four favourite facts from the
00:02:08,00:02:13,last seven days so in no particular order here we go. Starting with fact number
00:02:13,00:02:18,one and that is Andy. My fact is that half the nitrogen in your body was made in
00:02:18,00:02:25,a factory. Which factory? It won't have been made in the UK anymore because of
00:02:25,00:02:31,Brexit. It's a range of factors. But the last nitrogen making factory I think has
00:02:31,00:02:37,just shut down. Is that the billing of manufacturing plugs? Yes it is.
00:02:37,00:02:41,Has that closed? I didn't know that. It either has done or is about to but let's
00:02:41,00:02:47,"zoom out a little bit. Just thinking though. Even if it's just closed,"
00:02:47,00:02:51,surely it takes a while for all the nitrogen to be replaced so maybe some
00:02:51,00:02:55,of it's British nitrogen in my body? You might have some British nitrogen in you
00:02:55,00:03:01,"but I'm afraid a lot of it would be filthy foreign nitrogen. Right, all"
00:03:01,00:03:06,"life forms, don't write in, most life forms, mammals and plants all contain"
00:03:06,00:03:10,nitrogen. It's a really important component in your body. It's required to
00:03:10,00:03:13,"make the protein in your body and all these various hormones, neurotransmitters,"
00:03:13,00:03:19,"it's vital. Nitrogen is very important and most of the air is nitrogen,"
00:03:19,00:03:24,78% of the atmosphere is nitrogen but that's not where you get your
00:03:24,00:03:27,nitrogen from. So you can't just breathe in the nitrogen from the air and get it in
00:03:27,00:03:31,"your body? No, even if you hold your breath for ages, none of the nitrogen"
00:03:31,00:03:34,goes in that way. It doesn't work. For a waste. What a waste but you get it from
00:03:34,00:03:39,"your food. So meat, fish, dairy, vegetable, cereals, nuts, all of those foods"
00:03:39,00:03:45,"contain some nitrogen, right? So plants get it from the air. I mean there's a"
00:03:45,00:03:48,complicated bacterial process. That's all we'll get there.
00:03:48,00:03:52,Or lightning. Or lightning and that's another way. We'll get there as well.
00:03:52,00:03:57,"The point is that about two or three kilos of your body, roughly half of your"
00:03:57,00:04:02,"forearm to the end of your hand, is nitrogen. Is that where it all is?"
00:04:02,00:04:06,So the amount of you made in a factory is roughly your hand and wrist and that's
00:04:06,00:04:12,because nitrogen-based fertilizer has become an enormous thing in the last
00:04:12,00:04:16,century. It's incredibly important. It's why the human population has risen from
00:04:16,00:04:20,one or two billion to now eight billion. The sole reason is that we have enough
00:04:20,00:04:24,ways of feeding people because we have enough fertilizers to grow crops and
00:04:24,00:04:27,the way we do that is with this brilliant chemical process discovered at the
00:04:27,00:04:33,start of the 20th century which allows us to pull nitrogen from the sky and make
00:04:33,00:04:38,it into fertilizer to make plants grow. Does this mean I'm not organic? Yeah.
00:04:38,00:04:43,That's the point of buying all that nice food. Nitrogen fixation. Do you remember
00:04:43,00:04:47,learning about that? That was where I sort of lost interest and now coming back
00:04:47,00:04:51,"to it I thought, God this is fascinating. But poor old nitrogen being told it has to"
00:04:51,00:04:55,be fixed. So there's this conundrum which Andy sort of touched on where it's
00:04:55,00:05:00,the air's full of it but plants can't take it in without assistance and so it
00:05:00,00:05:05,needs to be fixed by these bacteria that basically make plant roots grow these
00:05:05,00:05:09,nodules which act as their homes and then they live in these nodules and they
00:05:09,00:05:14,fix this nitrogen turning into ammonia which plants can use. And the nitrogen
00:05:14,00:05:20,came originally from a star exploding. Ooh. That's essentially it. Didn't know that?
00:05:20,00:05:23,The big bang can make hydrogen helium but anything else needs to be made in
00:05:23,00:05:28,stars. The original nitrogen factory is a star. Yeah exactly. So some star created
00:05:28,00:05:32,lots of nitrogen then it exploded. Eventually it came to Earth. Then
00:05:32,00:05:37,eventually it got in the sky. Then eventually a bacterium fixed it and then
00:05:37,00:05:40,it got put into a carrot and then you ate the carrot and then it went into your
00:05:40,00:05:43,bloodstream and then it got turned into proteins which got turned into muscles.
00:05:43,00:05:48,It definitely gets less exciting. Part of the journey starts off really well and
00:05:48,00:05:52,then it's sort of sitting in a carrot. Yeah so how did we learn to make this
00:05:52,00:05:58,stuff? Oh I'm so glad you asked. Oh it's like inside the factory with Greg Wallace.
00:05:58,00:06:09,It's all thanks to something called the Haber-Bosch process or Haber-Bosch
00:06:09,00:06:14,sometimes known. So Flitz Haber and Karl Bosch were two German chemists and the
00:06:14,00:06:17,problem was like everyone knew that we needed more nitrogen at the time but it
00:06:17,00:06:20,was very hard to work out how we're going to actually get it. And you know what we
00:06:20,00:06:24,"talked about? Guano, like the Guano Gold Rush because bird poo contains lots of"
00:06:24,00:06:28,nitrates. So that in the 19th century was used to increase crop yields and that
00:06:28,00:06:33,saved everyone's bacon and you know it was brilliant for a while. They ran out of bacon very
00:06:33,00:06:41,nice. Talking about the Haber-Bosch process. Can I talk about bacon? You know bacon is
00:06:41,00:06:46,most bacon is cured with nitrates as in that's what makes it last longer which
00:06:46,00:06:51,is a type of nitrogen or it's a molecule with nitrogen in it and when
00:06:51,00:06:56,it goes green bacon that is something called nitrate burn and it's a
00:06:56,00:06:59,reaction to the chemical that's used to cure it and it means that it's still
00:06:59,00:07:03,good to eat. So if your bacon's got a bit green you can still eat it. Amazing. It's
00:07:03,00:07:07,"not bacteria, it's not anything that's bad for you, it's just a natural part of"
00:07:07,00:07:11,the process. I thought it was rotten. Yeah. I thought my bacon had gone off. I'm not
00:07:11,00:07:14,saying that all green bacon is good to eat. That's what I've taken away from this.
00:07:14,00:07:18,But if you bought it only a week ago it's probably fine. Sorry Andy you were
00:07:18,00:07:23,saying about Bosch and Haber. Haber. Yeah so basically he was a chemist and it was
00:07:23,00:07:28,a very difficult process to work out. He knew that lightning as you said
00:07:28,00:07:31,James breaks apart nitrogen bonds because nitrogen molecules are really
00:07:31,00:07:34,tightly bonded. It takes a lot of effort to break them apart to turn them into
00:07:34,00:07:38,ammonia but eventually he worked out sort of pressurized process to combine
00:07:38,00:07:42,nitrogen and hydrogen and that makes the ammonia fertilizer and he developed
00:07:42,00:07:47,that in 1913 Haber and it was just before the war and there's a theory that it
00:07:47,00:07:50,actually kept the first world war going for longer than it should have done
00:07:50,00:07:55,because German imports of fertilizer were blockaded but he was able to he had
00:07:55,00:07:58,created a process where you could make as they called it bread from air. So if we
00:07:58,00:08:02,stopped any poo from getting over to Germany during the war they could make
00:08:02,00:08:07,their own stuff. Exactly. Yeah basically yeah I mean that was it. And he got the
00:08:07,00:08:10,Nobel Prize for it didn't he which was extremely controversial. It was very
00:08:10,00:08:14,controversial. On the cover of his other legacy. Yeah because he made poison gas.
00:08:14,00:08:18,Right. That's so funny. I can't believe the Nobel Prize in 1919 went to someone
00:08:18,00:08:23,who'd invented which gas was it was it? Chlorine. Chlorine gas. It's bad. It was quite
00:08:23,00:08:28,"controversial. Yeah. He did kill 90,000 people with it. Not he didn't go round"
00:08:28,00:08:32,personally spraying it into the trenches. Yeah he was responsible for the birth of
00:08:32,00:08:36,arguably six billion. Yeah absolutely. And round the bounce. Do you think on like
00:08:36,00:08:39,interviews and stuff he's like I don't want to talk about that. I want to talk about my
00:08:39,00:08:44,Nobel Prize winning work. Because his wife Clara was a chemist as well and they
00:08:44,00:08:49,had a huge dispute after the I think the first battle of Ypres where poison gas
00:08:49,00:08:53,was used for the first time and killed thousands. He said it was no different
00:08:53,00:08:56,killing someone with a bomber bullet. She said it is very different. And then
00:08:56,00:09:01,she she killed herself. She shot her. The ultimate axe in an argument. We don't
00:09:01,00:09:05,know for sure that the argument is what led to the suicide. I really believe any
00:09:05,00:09:09,notes or anything like that. But we know she really she's fascinating Clara
00:09:09,00:09:13,Haber and or Harbert if you're a German listening. She was Germany's first female
00:09:13,00:09:18,doctor of chemistry. She got a PhD in 1900. And she turned him down. The first
00:09:18,00:09:21,time Fritz proposed she turned him down because she wanted to be financially
00:09:21,00:09:25,independent. Which is crazy in 1900 as a woman. But she'd gone hey I want to live
00:09:25,00:09:29,under my own steam. And then she decided marriage would kind of empower her which
00:09:29,00:09:33,it bloody well didn't. Which she did complain about. Understandably she was
00:09:33,00:09:36,like hang on my husband turns out to be very self-serving constantly working. I
00:09:36,00:09:41,don't have a chance at all to develop my career. And he's a mass murderer. And it
00:09:41,00:09:44,turns out he's a mass murderer and that's the final straw. And he was like no no
00:09:44,00:09:49,talk about that other stuff. Did you see pictures of her? I think she looks a
00:09:49,00:09:54,bit like Fanella Dan's wife. Oh do you? Yeah I haven't seen a photo of her. I'm not
00:09:54,00:09:58,very good with faces as we all know. And that was what I thought. And do you
00:09:58,00:10:02,associate Dan with Fritz Haber the mass murdering but mass life producing
00:10:02,00:10:07,complex character? In some ways. But I think Dan is more of a wife guy than Fritz
00:10:07,00:10:13,Haber was. So then Haber escaped to Switzerland wearing a false beard after
00:10:13,00:10:18,the war. Amazing. And then after World War One because obviously we had then
00:10:18,00:10:22,had the Treaty of Versailles which really punished Germany right. And so he
00:10:22,00:10:27,came up with the idea of extracting gold from the ocean to pay off all of the war
00:10:27,00:10:31,reparations. Because he knew that there was loads and loads of gold in the ocean.
00:10:31,00:10:35,And he thought if I can get at that we'll be rich beyond our wildest dreams.
00:10:35,00:10:40,It doesn't work. And actually we still can't do it of course. What's the term that I think
00:10:40,00:10:43,you've told me about Jamesford when Nobel Prize winners win a prize and then
00:10:43,00:10:46,they come up with a really insane and subsequent idea? It goes to their head.
00:10:46,00:10:51,Nobelitis. Nobelitis sounds like a serious case. But if you've done it once but you've
00:10:51,00:10:55,literally made bread from air. The human population is going to grow by
00:10:55,00:10:59,billions. From the guy who brought bread from air comes gold from the ocean.
00:10:59,00:11:02,It works. I believe it.
00:11:02,00:11:08,"And actually, sort of associated, the Nobel Prize in 1935 was awarded for"
00:11:08,00:11:12,basically being able to turn an element into another element which was the
00:11:12,00:11:15,alchemy that people had dreamed of forever and ever. That people had tried to
00:11:15,00:11:20,make gold and actually this was turning boron into nitrogen which wasn't quite
00:11:20,00:11:25,the fantasy of a 17th century alchemist. But like these factories were
00:11:25,00:11:31,taking already existing nitrogen out of the air and making it into ammonia which
00:11:31,00:11:35,"could be used. But Marie Curie's daughter who won that prize, right? I remember her"
00:11:35,00:11:38,name. But that was actually making new nitrogen which no one had ever done
00:11:38,00:11:43,before. Totally. So this was amazing. And I didn't realise that. She was the second
00:11:43,00:11:48,"female to win a Nobel Prize, Marie Curie's daughter. Was Marie Curie the"
00:11:48,00:11:56,"first? Yes. And it was Leppo, baby. But it was husband and wife as well. So just"
00:11:56,00:12:00,"like Marie Curie and her husband Pierre who won a joint prize. Sweetly, it was"
00:12:00,00:12:04,Marie Curie's daughter Irene and her husband Frederick Joliot Curie who won
00:12:04,00:12:07,the Nobel Prize in 1935. Do you think that maybe they didn't have a chance
00:12:07,00:12:10,unless you sort of did stand behind a man a bit and then? I'm sure there was
00:12:10,00:12:13,something about that. Although her surname was Curie so I think that probably
00:12:13,00:12:19,helped. I think that opened a few doors. And also her way of making nitrogen was
00:12:19,00:12:24,"firing radioactivity at Boron, wasn't it? I think. Yeah. So it's kind of, you know,"
00:12:24,00:12:29,"in the parents' realm. Okay. Yes, she probably had her equipment in the"
00:12:29,00:12:35,"garage already. And if memory serves I think she died of leukemia, didn't she?"
00:12:35,00:12:39,"What, the younger? I think Irene did. Related to the work she'd done? I'm sure."
00:12:39,00:12:42,"I'm gonna be honest, I'm going off memory but I think that's right. Because Marie,"
00:12:42,00:12:46,"it was the last thing that Marie almost did, was see the results of her daughter's"
00:12:46,00:12:51,"successful test before she died of leukemia. Yeah, nice. One thing on the"
00:12:51,00:12:56,"Billingham manufacturing plan. Oh, thank God. Thank God. Instructs nontes in England."
00:12:56,00:13:01,We'd better get a free trip. Out of it. It's closed. I'm not going to close down.
00:13:01,00:13:05,"I've had worse daytrips out of it, you know, I credit Cardiff."
00:13:05,00:13:11,Aldous Huxley went there. They gave him a trip around and he based some of Brave New
00:13:11,00:13:14,World on it. So you know in Brave New World they like have a factory making
00:13:14,00:13:19,"humans, I think, don't they? Yeah. And like, yeah, they make clones and stuff like that."
00:13:19,00:13:22,Yeah. And he saw this Billingham factory that was effectively making life by
00:13:22,00:13:26,"making this nitrogen. I am imagining like Willy Wonka style, like it's so"
00:13:26,00:13:30,"whimsical. It's a reverse Willy Wonka, because in Willy Wonka don't the kids"
00:13:30,00:13:33,go in and never come out. Whereas in Brave New World you get loads of new kids from
00:13:33,00:13:36,"the factory. The kids do come out, they just come out all weird shapes and"
00:13:36,00:13:40,colours. They've all been really quite fucked up psychologically and physically.
00:13:40,00:13:44,Every chocolate factory has a nitrogen factory next to it to make new children.
00:13:44,00:13:53,I learned about what I think is the most exciting moment in history. In all of
00:13:53,00:13:56,history. As we said at the start nitrogen is essential for life because it makes
00:13:56,00:14:00,amino acids which make proteins and that's like the whole building box of
00:14:00,00:14:05,what all living things are made of. But there's this kind of mystery which is
00:14:05,00:14:09,how did the first life get its nitrogen? Because as we've said it needs this
00:14:09,00:14:14,bacteria to be made accessible. And it can also be made by lightning striking
00:14:14,00:14:18,through it. But actually not enough seems to be generated by that. And it
00:14:18,00:14:23,seemed quite unlikely and it seems like the likeliest explanation for where the
00:14:23,00:14:26,"very first life ever came from. God. Whatever, three and a half billion years ago is"
00:14:26,00:14:31,"God. And there we go. That is exciting. Wait, this is like the original chicken and egg"
00:14:31,00:14:36,really. So what is the answer? The answer is it happened with volcanic
00:14:36,00:14:41,lightning. Which I just think is the coolest moment. It's so basically when
00:14:41,00:14:45,volcanoes erupt then lots and lots of lightning can be generated from the
00:14:45,00:14:48,eruption. It's when all this ash goes up it's a really complicated process.
00:14:48,00:14:52,But basically that ash rubbing against each other makes static electricity.
00:14:52,00:14:54,"And if you look you've got loads and loads of lightning bolts, hundreds of"
00:14:54,00:14:57,them in this volcanic eruption. And scientists have looked at the soil
00:14:57,00:15:02,"around volcanoes, seen they're full of nitrates which plants can use. And"
00:15:02,00:15:07,realise we think this must be how the first life ever was created was when
00:15:07,00:15:12,shed loads of lightning was firing above a volcano as it was erupting and it
00:15:12,00:15:15,allowed nitrogen to get into the soil in a way that could make ice.
00:15:15,00:15:19,That isn't like an origin story I can get behind. I'm so glad it wasn't just
00:15:19,00:15:23,like oh this cell touched this cell and a fish flopped out of a thing and like
00:15:23,00:15:27,all of the other origin stories are so lame. That's like Frankenstein
00:15:27,00:15:31,"electricity, evil laughter, lava. So metal."
00:15:31,00:15:34,James you just mentioned the Treaty of Versailles. Yes.
00:15:34,00:15:38,So the Haber-Bosch process is so significant that it was part of the
00:15:38,00:15:40,"package of the Treaty of Versailles. No, was it?"
00:15:40,00:15:45,The Western powers ordered via the treaty Germany to hand over the secret of
00:15:45,00:15:49,making these fertilisers. Really? That makes sense.
00:15:49,00:15:52,All sorts of stuff they cobbled on to the Treaty of Versailles.
00:15:52,00:15:54,Crazy shit. We've mentioned it in the past and I can't remember what it was.
00:15:54,00:15:56,Something else that's really random. Champagne.
00:15:56,00:16:00,They also didn't they want to change the way that orchestras were tuned.
00:16:00,00:16:04,"Yeah, yeah. That's it. Like there must have been like and another thing."
00:16:04,00:16:10,"It's like having an argument with your partner. Yeah, it starts with something"
00:16:10,00:16:13,else and you're like I'm just going to dredge up all these other things.
00:16:13,00:16:18,"Yeah, the ultimate argument with a partner. What? What's champagne? Sorry."
00:16:18,00:16:22,"Oh, the fact that champagne can only be made in the Champagne region and"
00:16:22,00:16:25,anywhere else. It's sparkling wine. That comes from the Treaty of Versailles.
00:16:25,00:16:28,That's it. I didn't know that. Wow. I was thinking like
00:16:28,00:16:32,surely the French already had champagne. The interesting part of that being that
00:16:32,00:16:37,Russia didn't sign it and America didn't sign it and in both those countries
00:16:37,00:16:39,you could buy champagne which isn't from France.
00:16:39,00:16:42,No way. America didn't sign the Treaty of Versailles.
00:16:42,00:16:44,"I think the little known fact, the First World War is still going on."
00:16:44,00:16:48,They had their own treaties. They did.
00:16:48,00:16:51,Do America and Russia have a good culture of champagne?
00:16:51,00:16:53,Are they known for a good champagne anywhere?
00:16:53,00:16:55,"California and white wine. Yeah, that's true."
00:16:55,00:16:57,You must be able to make good champagne out of that.
00:16:57,00:16:59,"Yeah, just sticking Alka-Seltzer in it."
00:16:59,00:17:00,Bob's your uncle.
00:17:00,00:17:10,"Okay, it is time for fact number two and that is Anna."
00:17:10,00:17:14,My fact this week is that Harriet Tubman once walked into a hospital
00:17:14,00:17:18,and asked a doctor to cut her head open and he immediately did.
00:17:19,00:17:26,"Just mad. So Harriet Tubman, extremely famous in America, probably less well known about here,"
00:17:26,00:17:30,"I would say, but you know one of the most influential famous abolitionists ever."
00:17:30,00:17:34,"One of the conductors of the Underground Railroad, responsible for smuggling lots of"
00:17:34,00:17:39,enslaved people into freedom in the 19th century and one thing that I've learned through reading
00:17:39,00:17:46,"about her, she was insanely hardcore. So tough. So and this is just an element of it."
00:17:46,00:17:51,"She was very old at the time. She must have been in her 60s or 70s, I think in the 1890s"
00:17:51,00:17:57,and late 1890s. She's in Boston and she passed this big building and she asked what it was
00:17:57,00:18:02,"and someone said it was a hospital and she thought, ""Well, I've had these terrible headaches my whole"
00:18:02,00:18:07,life. She really had had awful like headaches and like terrible vision problems. I was probably
00:18:07,00:18:12,"disabled by it."" So she went right in and she said, ""I saw a young man there and I said, 'Sir,"
00:18:12,00:18:17,"are you a doctor?' And he said he was and then I said, 'Sir, do you think you could cut my head open?'"
00:18:17,00:18:23,"And he said, 'Lay right down here on this table.' And Son's painkillers, he soared open her skull"
00:18:23,00:18:29,"and raised it up apparently. And then as she put it, she got up, put on her bonnet and started to"
00:18:29,00:18:34,"walk home, but her legs did get a bit wobbly and give out under her. So they gave her an ambulance"
00:18:34,00:18:38,"to take her the rest of the way."" It's astonishing. Yeah, sorry, some questions."
00:18:39,00:18:42,"When you say he raised up, it isn't like a loft extension of her skull."
00:18:42,00:18:49,Was her brain too big? What is going on? I think this was a slightly questionable
00:18:49,00:18:53,"medical procedure, which she said worked and may have been more placebo than much."
00:18:53,00:18:57,"She didn't go and say, ""My brain is a bit low."" My brain's a little bit low in my head."
00:18:57,00:19:03,"It's always been my neck. Did she just wrench it? Well, she did say it feels more comfortable now."
00:19:04,00:19:09,"Apparently, she yet refused anesthetic, bit of bullet, as they did in the Civil War."
00:19:09,00:19:14,"That is actually, I'm afraid, a myth, but it's a very interesting subject you raise, Alex,"
00:19:14,00:19:18,because it's the mythology of her life which has been so turned into all these stories.
00:19:18,00:19:21,Because I personally don't believe any of this. It sounds ridiculous.
00:19:21,00:19:25,"It's interesting because the more you read, you're like, ""That's a great fact."" And then you read"
00:19:25,00:19:30,"again, someone goes, ""No, that's a myth."" And then a lot of the myths come from relatively"
00:19:30,00:19:34,"close sources, don't they? Like the first biography I've heard that was written,"
00:19:34,00:19:37,there's loads of myths in there. She never got to write her own. She wanted to write her own.
00:19:37,00:19:41,"She never got to. Is it? What, you need to learn to read first, hon? Yeah, that's true."
00:19:41,00:19:52,Have you heard this story? That's why I decided to do a fact about it.
00:19:52,00:19:55,"On the reading, did you hear, I imagine this could be in a proctovoltaire as well,"
00:19:55,00:19:59,"but there's a story that she was many years after all of her time running the Underground Railroad,"
00:19:59,00:20:05,that she was on a train and a former master of hers got on. And she was a known figure by that
00:20:05,00:20:09,"point. But, and so to avoid being recognized, she grabbed a nearby newspaper and pretended to read"
00:20:09,00:20:14,it because she was known for not being able to read. Oh yeah. And then who was on the front cover
00:20:14,00:20:19,of that newspaper? The face was lined up perfectly without the wanted sign here.
00:20:19,00:20:24,"No, I think it's probably untrue. Because I've had a different version of it, which is that"
00:20:24,00:20:29,"when she was on one of her missions, because she left the South where she'd been enslaved and she"
00:20:29,00:20:32,"went back to free former slaves, and you know, she did a lot of that,"
00:20:32,00:20:36,"shuttling back forward. But she was back in the South in 1856, and she overheard some men reading"
00:20:36,00:20:42,"her wanted poster, right, which said clearly she's illiterate, and then she got out of book and"
00:20:42,00:20:46,"pretended to read it, and the ploy was enough to fool the men. And they were like, she looks just"
00:20:46,00:20:50,"like Harriet Tubman, but she's reading, so it can't be her. Yeah, yeah, yeah, she's reading a normal"
00:20:50,00:20:56,"book upside down, but why would you put on the wanted poster that... She can't read,"
00:20:56,00:21:04,"isn't it? Yeah, exactly. And also, I think the idea that people even knew who she was at the time"
00:21:04,00:21:10,is false. So they knew that there was a person who was helping all these enslaved people be freed.
00:21:10,00:21:15,"They knew that people were calling them some kind of Moses, because they were free in their people,"
00:21:15,00:21:19,"but they didn't know anything about her personally, and a lot of people assumed it was a white"
00:21:19,00:21:25,"abolitionist who was helping enslaved people. But it is interesting, because a lot of the"
00:21:25,00:21:28,"stuff you read, you just think that can't be true, and it's not to do down her amazing achievements"
00:21:28,00:21:34,"at all, but it's to show that she's become this unbelievable cult figure. It's almost mythological"
00:21:34,00:21:37,"with some of the stories around her. Yeah, we've got to tread quite a careful line between slamming"
00:21:37,00:21:42,"one of the most beloved and famous women in American history, and also sort of ignoring it,"
00:21:42,00:21:45,"because she does amazing stuff. I find her the most incredible person, one of the most"
00:21:45,00:21:50,"incredible people ever. I don't have the energy sometimes to finish the research with this podcast,"
00:21:50,00:21:55,"and this woman, she was very disabled, she was female, she was black, she was enslaved,"
00:21:55,00:21:59,"just this extraordinary life, and she fought in the Civil War as well. She, after being this"
00:21:59,00:22:04,"abolitionist hero, she fought in the Civil War, she was incredibly charitable. I don't understand"
00:22:04,00:22:10,"where she got the energy, and it actually makes me quite angry. Her injury, her disability came"
00:22:10,00:22:16,when she was injured by an overseer who threw a stone weight at her head when she was quite young.
00:22:16,00:22:18,"He actually threw it at someone else, they're thinking it missed and hit her."
00:22:18,00:22:23,"Is that right? Yeah. Oh, that's bad luck. But yeah, she had sleeping spells quite often,"
00:22:23,00:22:28,"so she would just kind of fall asleep, what we'd probably call narcolepsy today. But she would have"
00:22:28,00:22:32,"like these kind of hazy dreams while she was asleep, and because she was very religious,"
00:22:32,00:22:38,"she thought they were kind of premonitions from God. It's quite stressful, the idea, let's say"
00:22:38,00:22:43,"you've been enslaved, Harriet Tubman's come back, she's freed you, she's guiding you to the north,"
00:22:43,00:22:49,and then she just falls asleep. It's a bit of a comedy scene.
00:22:49,00:22:55,"There is sick or potential in this life, is what I'm saying. I think that might be the first time"
00:22:55,00:23:00,"ever someone said there's sick or potential in Harriet Tubman's life. She went back, she freed,"
00:23:00,00:23:05,"and the numbers vary, so she rescued 60 or 70 people herself personally, and then she gave"
00:23:05,00:23:11,"instructions to another 70 odd, and that got slightly inflated to 300. But she did go back,"
00:23:11,00:23:17,"I mean, between about around 10 times, she made a mission back into the south, which was really"
00:23:17,00:23:21,"perilous. She also went back at one point to go free her husband, who she'd left, came back, found"
00:23:21,00:23:26,"that he'd remarried, and there's a line which, again, is probably just a biographer, sort of like"
00:23:26,00:23:30,"she thought about making a scene, but then decided against it and rescued him anyway. But it's like"
00:23:30,00:23:34,the idea again of like the sort of two minutes where she's deciding whether to massively kick
00:23:34,00:23:39,"off another woman or to save you. Well, he didn't need to be rescued per se, because he was not"
00:23:39,00:23:46,"enslaved, he was a free man. Which was kind of a big deal at the time, because a free man marrying"
00:23:46,00:23:52,"an enslaved woman, you would lose a lot of your rights, because all your children would be automatically"
00:23:52,00:23:57,"enslaved, you wouldn't be able to get married unless you had permission of the woman's master,"
00:23:57,00:24:03,"as they called them. Yeah, so that was quite a big deal, but yeah, like you say, once she was off"
00:24:03,00:24:08,"doing her gallivanting, he was like, ""No, I'm just going to find another wife now."" Again, the sitcom"
00:24:08,00:24:15,"is taking shape. One sweet thing I do like is that when she retired eventually, she retired"
00:24:15,00:24:19,"into a retirement home that she had founded. So she, in 1908, she opened the Harriet Tubman"
00:24:19,00:24:25,"Home for the elderly, specifically for like, indigent and aged African Americans, as it was"
00:24:25,00:24:29,"described. Are we sure they didn't misunderstand? And she said, ""No, I called it the Harriet Tubman"
00:24:29,00:24:36,"Home because it's just a home for Harriet."" Here's another good thing. Okay, this is good, and I'm"
00:24:36,00:24:41,"pretty sure this is true as well. So on the missions, when she was taking people over to the north,"
00:24:41,00:24:46,"she would sing, right, and there were particular songs, and some people say she would sing things"
00:24:46,00:24:49,"like ""Swing, Loves, Sweet, Harriet,"" but that hadn't been written yet. But she was very ahead of"
00:24:49,00:24:57,"us. She was, yeah. So there were songs called ""Go Down Moses"" and ""Bound for the Promised Land,"""
00:24:57,00:25:01,"right, and those were real songs, which she did sing at the time. And this is a cool thing,"
00:25:01,00:25:05,"she would change the tempo of the songs to indicate whether it was safe to come out or not,"
00:25:05,00:25:10,so she would just be walking along singing. But the way she was singing was a message to the
00:25:10,00:25:15,"people she was ferrying north. Does that mean, like, you know, if everything's going well and"
00:25:15,00:25:19,"they need to run, does she like go dill-a-dill-a-dill-a-dill-a-dill-a-dill? And then if they needed"
00:25:19,00:25:24,"to be slower, she would just do it. And if she stopped singing completely, she's fallen asleep."
00:25:24,00:25:30,"I was looking into possibly what kind of brain surgery she had, and then I went on a bit of a"
00:25:30,00:25:36,"journey and found a really fascinating syndrome, which I cannot believe we have never spoken about"
00:25:36,00:25:41,"before. And I feel like we might have it, actually. This is the... It's called Forster syndrome,"
00:25:41,00:25:46,"or also known as Witzel sucked, and it's the pathological urge to constantly make puns."
00:25:46,00:25:51,Witzel sucked. I had that for a while. Witzel sucked.
00:25:53,00:26:01,Somebody get a doctor. Fucking hell. So this was first noted in 1929 by a German urologist called
00:26:01,00:26:05,"Ottfried Forster, who is named after. He was operating on a patient to remove a tumour,"
00:26:05,00:26:09,"and the patient was awake, as often happens, as was the case with Harriet Tubman."
00:26:09,00:26:15,"And as he started moving around this tumour, the man suddenly, he was face down strapped to the"
00:26:15,00:26:19,"table. He suddenly just started talking manically, and just like making pun after pun, they were"
00:26:19,00:26:23,all basically... I hardly even met him. Literally that. It was literally all about knives and
00:26:23,00:26:26,"surgery, and he'd obviously, because that was what was on his mind, because he was having brain"
00:26:26,00:26:31,"surgery. Literally what was on his mind, actually. Exactly. Jesus, guys, can you stop?"
00:26:31,00:26:38,Absolutely fascinating. And then there'd be more recent examples of this. There was a man a few
00:26:38,00:26:43,"years ago. We just know his name is Derek, because he was anonymous, but he had a couple of strokes,"
00:26:43,00:26:46,and his behaviour changed in many ways. He used to try and compulsively recycle stuff and things
00:26:46,00:26:50,"like that. And he started waking up his wife in the middle of the night, being like, ""I've"
00:26:50,00:26:53,"just come up with another pun."" And eventually his wife was like, ""Why didn't you start writing"
00:26:53,00:26:57,"down?"" And not telling me. But eventually realised that this was like a pathological"
00:26:57,00:27:02,"behaviour change. And the interesting other side effect is this, is that it's a really simple,"
00:27:02,00:27:09,"basic humour, like basic pun connections, basic, really basic jokes. There's a lot of skill involved."
00:27:09,00:27:13,"Neurologists studied this, and they showed them more complex joke patterns. They didn't"
00:27:13,00:27:16,find them funny at all. And it's something to do with that really basic pleasure of making
00:27:16,00:27:20,their connection in your head. But they also didn't find other people's jokes funny at all.
00:27:20,00:27:26,"That's basically every comedian, isn't it? Another thing about Tubman is that she did get"
00:27:26,00:27:30,famed by the end of her life and was recognisable. And a bunch of receptions were put on in her honour
00:27:30,00:27:35,"in the 1890s. They were put on in Boston, and she didn't live there. She had to get a train."
00:27:35,00:27:41,"But to pay for the train ticket, she had to sell one for cows. So in order to get to a bunch of"
00:27:41,00:27:46,"receptions thrown in her honour, where she was the star guest, she sold her cow to get the train."
00:27:46,00:27:50,"I think she spent so much of her life, different parts of her life in poverty,"
00:27:50,00:27:54,"just because she just gave away so much stuff. And when she rescued people from slavery,"
00:27:54,00:27:58,she used to then follow through and like get them jobs and like set them up in the new places
00:27:58,00:28:02,"that they did. She didn't just like get them somewhere and be like, ""See ya."" She did a lot"
00:28:02,00:28:07,"of cooking too. And that was relevant because she raised a lot of money for the missions by cooking,"
00:28:07,00:28:11,basically. And there was a really interesting piece about this sort of facet of a life on NPR.
00:28:11,00:28:16,"So she was once at a market, she came face to face with a former sort of slave overseer,"
00:28:16,00:28:21,"basically. And she was holding two chickens, right? Oh yeah. What did she do? She pretended to read"
00:28:21,00:28:27,"the chickens, brilliant. She said, ""Oh, looks like there's three cocks in the room."""
00:28:27,00:28:33,Very sassy. We're going in the pilot script. She shoved her head into a chicken and to disguise
00:28:33,00:28:38,herself as a chicken. Hit him with a chicken. She threw eggs at him. She released one of the
00:28:38,00:28:43,"chickens and then pretended to chase it, causing a comic kerfuffle. Ironically, by drawing attention"
00:28:43,00:28:47,"to herself, she deflected attention from herself. Again, another scene in the sitcom. That's what"
00:28:47,00:28:53,happens in Mr Bean's holiday. He chases a chicken for like 40 minutes. Comedy gold. That's the clever
00:28:53,00:29:01,"girl, the beanographer. I do love Mr Bean. So there's a link between her and Queen Victoria,"
00:29:01,00:29:06,"which I find interesting. So in 1897, Queen Victoria sent her a shawl to sort of mark her"
00:29:06,00:29:11,"amazing work. Yeah, it was a gift. Yeah, a gift. Yeah, yeah. But I thought I could do a little"
00:29:11,00:29:18,"quiz for you now. Brilliant. Who was taller? Queen Victoria or Harriet Tubman? Ooh, good one."
00:29:18,00:29:23,"Well, Queen Victoria was no more than five foot. I think perhaps less, four foot, 11 feet. She was"
00:29:23,00:29:27,famously quite short. Famously short. I believe famously her circumference ended up being more
00:29:27,00:29:31,"than her height at the end of her life. Does this help us with Tubman, though? Tubman's got to be"
00:29:31,00:29:35,taller. I know she was on the small side. I think she's going to be smaller because it's not a fun
00:29:35,00:29:41,"quiz because Queen Victoria was quite short. I think the fun ship has sailed. I'm going to say,"
00:29:41,00:29:46,I think Tubman was an inch taller. I reckon she was five foot on the dot. I'm going to say they're
00:29:46,00:29:52,"exactly the same height. Brilliant. I'm going to say Tubman was an inch shorter. Well, Anna's closest."
00:29:53,00:29:59,"Tubman was four foot, 11. Oh, Queen Victoria. Now, James, I have read, I went down a real rabbit"
00:29:59,00:30:04,"hole. I'm sure you're right. Basically, we know there's a surviving tape measure kept by a portraitist"
00:30:04,00:30:10,"in 1837. My God. Which shows she was five foot one because she had been Victoria. I mean, not Tubman,"
00:30:10,00:30:15,but Queen Victoria had been claimed to be five foot two and they boosted her height by an inch.
00:30:15,00:30:19,"Obviously, it would be ridiculous to say she's five foot 10 and, you know, really leggy. Maybe"
00:30:19,00:30:23,"she was wearing heels. Basically, they were a bit embarrassed, the Royal Family, that she was only"
00:30:23,00:30:28,"five foot one because it made it seem like she hadn't been fed well in childhood and, you know,"
00:30:28,00:30:32,"she didn't like the taller children tend to be better fed. They boosted her height, sort of her"
00:30:32,00:30:38,public height to five foot two so that she would seem a bit better. But the portraitist had the
00:30:38,00:30:44,receipts. What I think is interesting is that this means approximately that Queen Victoria was
00:30:44,00:30:49,about the same height as Sandy Tuxwig and Harriet Tubman was about the same height as Susan Kalman.
00:30:49,00:30:55,Yes. So if we need people in your sitcom of Tubman. I think that's some problematic casting there.
00:30:55,00:31:00,"If you're saying Susan Kalman for the role of Harriet Tubman. I do see that now, yeah."
00:31:00,00:31:13,"Okay, time now for fact number three and that is James. Okay. My fact this week is that Wasabi"
00:31:13,00:31:20,"is good on sushi rolls and papyrus scrolls. Lovely. I beg to differ, personally."
00:31:20,00:31:25,What? Never tasted papyrus and yet I reckon I know it's not good. With or without Wasabi.
00:31:25,00:31:34,"Well, we come to the fact itself. He's worded it humorously. I wouldn't say that's even humorous."
00:31:34,00:31:40,It's just a rhyme. Lyrically. You've worded it misleadingly in the hope of humor.
00:31:41,00:31:46,It charmed me. I found it amusing. It is not misleading at all. So it's good on sushi rolls
00:31:46,00:31:50,"because it tastes good, in my opinion. And there are other reasons that we might come to."
00:31:50,00:31:56,"Papyrus scrolls though is the main interesting part, which is this new technique of looking"
00:31:56,00:32:02,"after papyrus. Now there is a problem that because papyrus is made from plants, it can fall victim to"
00:32:02,00:32:09,fungal infections and the fungus can damage the papyrus and it can cause the paints to fade and
00:32:09,00:32:15,stuff like that. And so there has been a study in the Journal of Archaeological Science which has
00:32:15,00:32:24,put some Wasabi vapours onto the papyrus and these smells kill off the funguses or rather
00:32:24,00:32:28,stop the funguses from growing very well and they don't get rid of the colour so you can still read
00:32:28,00:32:33,"them. And yeah, this is a lot safer and better for the environment than what you might use before,"
00:32:33,00:32:39,which is chemicals. It's super noninvasive because they just put the Wasabi near the
00:32:39,00:32:44,"papyrus. Yeah, yeah. What I really like in this study is that they didn't want to use actual,"
00:32:44,00:32:49,"you know, ancient Egyptians and papyruses, but they wanted to see if it worked on something"
00:32:49,00:32:53,"like that. So they did exactly what you would do at primary school, which is heat it up some"
00:32:53,00:32:58,"papyrus to make it look like it was really old. You know, like you might do if you're making a"
00:32:58,00:33:05,"pirate map at school. Yeah, they did it in tea. They made new papyrus. They made new papyrus."
00:33:05,00:33:10,Aged it up fast. They aged it fast by heating it up. That's so clever. Yeah. And then they mixed
00:33:10,00:33:15,"water and Wasabi, almost like if you mix your Wasabi with soy sauce, that kind of, you know,"
00:33:15,00:33:20,"and after the end of the process, you've got a snack. Yeah, exactly. I'm less worried about"
00:33:20,00:33:25,wasting papyrus on this process and more worried about wasting good Wasabi on this process.
00:33:25,00:33:32,"It's very precious Wasabi. It's very hard to make, isn't it? It's hard to obtain it and they're"
00:33:32,00:33:37,"just like steaming away Wasabi at papyrus. And isn't most Wasabi not real Wasabi? I mean, I've"
00:33:37,00:33:41,"probably never had real Wasabi. I didn't think I've ever had real Wasabi. No, it's most in Japan"
00:33:41,00:33:46,"though. You must have done. I have been, but I read that even in Japan, a lot of it is... I believe"
00:33:46,00:33:51,most of it in Japan. It's horse radish. What if I went to a really nice restaurant in Japan?
00:33:51,00:33:56,You're probably fine. Would it be? I think 5 or 10% of Wasabi served in Japan is real Wasabi.
00:33:56,00:34:01,"Really? But in the West, it's like 1% is real Wasabi. It's really... And it's all horse radish."
00:34:01,00:34:05,It's all dying. And horse radish is really strong. But I think Wasabi is a bit gentler and a bit more
00:34:05,00:34:11,interestingly delicate and a bit more flavoursome. So that's what I read. Yeah. Yeah. And a bit...
00:34:11,00:34:15,"You can tell if you've got real stuff because it should be a bit grittier. Also, I didn't"
00:34:15,00:34:21,realise that you need to eat it immediately as soon as it's been grated because it loses its zing.
00:34:21,00:34:26,So essentially you... Sometimes they bring the root to the table and a grater and you grate it
00:34:26,00:34:30,fresh onto your food. I think I prefer the horse radish. If the real Wasabi is bland and
00:34:30,00:34:34,"gritty and you have to have it immediately fresher, it goes off even more. No one said"
00:34:34,00:34:38,"bland. I just want to say if there are any chefs out there... Oh, Alex said bland. We didn't say"
00:34:38,00:34:43,bland. I don't believe delicate. And the other thing... The other reason Wasabi is good on sushi
00:34:43,00:34:48,"rolls, so not just because it tastes good, but also because it has antimicrobial properties."
00:34:48,00:34:54,"So as well as stopping funguses from growing, it can stop bacteria from growing. And it has"
00:34:54,00:35:01,"something in there called six-methyl sulfinylhexyl isothiocyanate, which stops E. coli,"
00:35:01,00:35:05,"staphylococcus, and salmonella from growing. Really? Yeah. Sounds like we should be taking"
00:35:05,00:35:11,"baths in it or something. It would be good for us as an auntie. I think even the delicate Wasabi,"
00:35:11,00:35:17,"if you have a bath in it, is going to get right up your nose. Yeah. And it will cost you a fair few,"
00:35:17,00:35:21,Bob. But you could put a bit in your shoes and stop fungal infection. You could go for a bath
00:35:21,00:35:26,"and onsen in Japan, and maybe someone could come over and just grate a little bit of Wasabi."
00:35:26,00:35:31,"That would be so lovely. Yeah, that's luxurious. You can look it. Sorry? You can look it and you"
00:35:31,00:35:38,"won't taste the spice. Oh. So there's no point in looking it? No, unless you don't like spicy food,"
00:35:38,00:35:42,"but you want to eat Wasabi, in which case just lick it, and then you won't get the spice,"
00:35:42,00:35:47,but you'll have touched Wasabi with your tongue. If you have fungus or microbes on your tongue.
00:35:47,00:35:51,"Yes. Yes. That's a good point. I think that should work. In fact, and it's a lot like how"
00:35:51,00:35:57,"lightning can split up nitrate. So by grating Wasabi, think of the greater as the lightning,"
00:35:57,00:36:02,"that splits up the Wasabi plant, and it splits up its cells. What a torture. How laboured, yeah."
00:36:02,00:36:07,I feel like I could have understood it without any of the previous callback.
00:36:07,00:36:11,Is that what creates the flavour? It breaks up the cells and creates the flavour exactly.
00:36:11,00:36:16,"How does Wasabi work? Well, let me take you back to the dawn of the universe."
00:36:16,00:36:21,Did you know horse radish is poisonous to horses? No.
00:36:21,00:36:28,"So they don't know why it's called that, but I actually like both options. So the word horse"
00:36:28,00:36:32,radish first appeared in 1597 in English. People think it might be because it resembles a horse's
00:36:32,00:36:38,genitalia. It speaks of a time when more people are familiar with what horses' knackers look like.
00:36:38,00:36:46,"You know, I could probably draw you one, but I would probably control them and push if I had to."
00:36:46,00:36:52,"You know, absolutely no. You could do an amazing shaded sketch. So it's either genitals, horse"
00:36:52,00:36:57,"radish, because they do look a bit like their, horse radish is like a moolly. I mean, that's"
00:36:57,00:37:01,"probably less. What's a moolly? It's like a long white radish, right? I don't know that."
00:37:01,00:37:05,It looks like a long white root. Is that what a moolly is? Yeah. Are they really big?
00:37:05,00:37:09,"Yeah. It's probably, I would say, how big is that? About foot long? No, it looks pretty normal."
00:37:09,00:37:12,"I think your moolly, Simone, might have been up there with my confusing lightning"
00:37:12,00:37:16,making things clearer. What's a moolly? A moolly is like a large radish.
00:37:16,00:37:20,"Like a horse radish? Yeah. All right, they're similar. I understand. I can see it's going"
00:37:20,00:37:24,round in circles. I genuinely thought people would know what a moolly looked like. Yeah.
00:37:24,00:37:29,"Okay, fine. What's the other option, Anna? Well remembered. Thanks, James. It's because, so in"
00:37:29,00:37:33,"German, you might, so you might be able to guess if I tell you that in German, a horse radish is"
00:37:33,00:37:39,"called 'Mierritich', to mean sea radish, actually. Oh. Not to be confused with the sea radish,"
00:37:39,00:37:43,"which is a different plant. I know, because it looks like a seahorse is genitalia."
00:37:43,00:37:47,"Yeah, very nice. You're miles off. In the older days, everyone knew what that looked like."
00:37:47,00:37:51,"Because we all rode seahorses throughout town, didn't we?"
00:37:51,00:37:57,What grows in the sea? It looks like a radish. It's more about pronunciation. It's about the
00:37:57,00:38:03,"pronunciation. So when we were translating it into English, we heard 'merradisch'. Oh, 'mer', as in"
00:38:03,00:38:08,like the 'mer' as in a female horse. As in a horse. Yeah. Let me give you another reason why it might
00:38:08,00:38:13,"be called that. Albertus Magnus was writing in the 13th century, and he discussed horse radish."
00:38:13,00:38:18,"He just called it 'radish', but he suggested it as a treatment for constipation in horses."
00:38:18,00:38:24,So it could be that we kind of heard the 'mer' thought we use it for constipation in
00:38:24,00:38:30,horses anyway. And so maybe that's why we call it horse radish. Is it up the bottom?
00:38:30,00:38:35,It didn't say. Albertus Magnus didn't say. He just said it's useful constipation in horses.
00:38:35,00:38:40,"It might have been up the bum, because there's another thing called rathanidosis,"
00:38:40,00:38:48,which is a punishment in ancient Greece of inserting the root of a radish up the bum
00:38:48,00:38:53,"as a punishment for adultery. Now, we don't know what kind of radish that was."
00:38:53,00:38:57,It probably wasn't one of those little red ones that you get in saints.
00:38:57,00:38:57,That's the first offence.
00:38:57,00:39:04,"But if it was horse radish, for instance, then that would be much more of a punishment,"
00:39:04,00:39:09,"because you're going to get that kind of wasabi burning up the bum, as well as having"
00:39:09,00:39:13,something that's the size of a mooly going up your bum. Not the size of a mooly.
00:39:13,00:39:17,I bet there was one person who got really turned on by it.
00:39:18,00:39:24,"I bet there was one example where someone was like, ""Oh, no, my adulterated again. Get the hammer."""
00:39:24,00:39:34,"Here's the thing on papyrus. Right. Oh, my goodness. Okay. Have you, right."
00:39:34,00:39:40,You know the Library of Alexandria? Yes. Okay. Ancient Egypt founded in the 295 BC.
00:39:40,00:39:43,"They had a copy of every book, or they were trying to get one."
00:39:43,00:39:47,"So the Ptolemies with the pharaohs at the time, they're all called Ptolemy basically,"
00:39:47,00:39:51,"and they would hunt for manuscripts everywhere, right? And they would send out,"
00:39:51,00:39:55,"if a pharaoh ship sailed into Alexandria, it was searched for scrolls,"
00:39:55,00:39:58,and then they'd be confiscated and copied out and then given back.
00:39:58,00:40:03,"And all this was on papyrus, right? And the Nile Valley was the center of the written word,"
00:40:03,00:40:09,because papyrus grew on the banks of the Nile. So the Ptolemies have basically a control supply.
00:40:09,00:40:16,"And then there's this rival library that sets up. King Eumenes of Pergamon founds a rival library,"
00:40:16,00:40:21,"the Library of Pergamon. And Pergamon was huge at the time. It was a big kingdom, like massive."
00:40:21,00:40:27,"Turkey. Modern-day Turkey. And more. You know, there was a big deal of Pergamites, I don't know."
00:40:27,00:40:32,"Anyway, basically, talk about the sitcom potential. There's the spell in history."
00:40:32,00:40:35,"We're from the makers of Harriet Tubman, exclamation mark."
00:40:35,00:40:42,"There's the spell in history where both libraries are trying to secure every book on the planet,"
00:40:42,00:40:46,"and they are bidding huge wages for scholars, like Premier League footballers for scholars,"
00:40:46,00:40:51,and scribes. Some scholars are imprisoned so they can't run off to the other library.
00:40:51,00:40:57,And then the huge move happens. Ptolemy V takes the rivalry to a new level about 100 years after
00:40:57,00:41:03,"the founding. He bans the export of papyrus. Huge move. Out. That's cheesy, isn't it?"
00:41:03,00:41:05,"Eat it, Pergamon. I was like taking the football off the pitch."
00:41:05,00:41:10,It basically is. You can't make any scrolls. You can't copy any manuscripts. We own literature.
00:41:10,00:41:15,"So what did Pergamon do? Well, he... Invented paper?"
00:41:15,00:41:18,"Yes, he must have invented paper. The audio book. He invented the audio book."
00:41:18,00:41:25,"They started manufacturing parchment from the skin of animals, and parchment literally means"
00:41:25,00:41:31,from Pergamon. That's the etymology way. That's so cool. And the thing about parchment is you can
00:41:31,00:41:35,"cut it up in layers, and you don't need to roll it in a scroll, which is incredibly inefficient."
00:41:35,00:41:39,You can have pages. You can have pages. That's so interesting.
00:41:39,00:41:45,"It's where parchment already existed, but they, as it were, put a lot of manufacturing behind it"
00:41:45,00:41:51,and made it bigger. And the book is better than the scroll. Wow. The pen is mightier than the sword.
00:41:51,00:41:54,"And the book is better than the scroll. Do you know what, Andy? I'm going to come out and say it."
00:41:54,00:41:58,That etymology is even more interesting than the horse genitalia. Well done.
00:41:58,00:42:00,Wow. Strug disagree.
00:42:06,00:42:11,"Okay, it's time for our final fact, and that is my fact. My fact this week is that bees smell"
00:42:11,00:42:15,like bananas when they get angry. I've never seen an angry banana.
00:42:15,00:42:23,"So, I think this is just a weird coincidence, really. Bees use pheromones a lot to communicate."
00:42:23,00:42:28,"They release different chemicals, which other bees can smell. One of the pheromones that they"
00:42:28,00:42:33,release is a distress or alarm signal. And maybe there's a predator. One of their bees is in trouble.
00:42:33,00:42:40,"Makes them really angry, too. And one of the chemicals in this pheromone is called isoamyl acetate."
00:42:40,00:42:45,And that also happens to be the chemical which is banana flavour.
00:42:45,00:42:49,"Yeah. Can I just say it? Mostly, because I think people often say, what you would know"
00:42:49,00:42:53,is banana flavour is actually this very specific banana thing. Most people know banana flavour
00:42:53,00:42:57,"from actual bananas, right? I mean, I don't have that many banana flavour things."
00:42:57,00:43:03,"Have more people eaten bananas or eaten a banana flavoured Angel Delight, maybe?"
00:43:03,00:43:08,I could go out there and say more people have eaten bananas than banana flavoured Angel Delight.
00:43:08,00:43:10,"Well, that's because bananas have an entrenched advantage, you know."
00:43:10,00:43:13,"Arguably, banana flavoured Angel Delight is better than a banana."
00:43:13,00:43:16,"If it grew on trees. Exactly, yeah."
00:43:16,00:43:20,But you have hit the point that artificial banana flavouring today
00:43:20,00:43:23,is not quite the same as the bananas we eat today. And you have mentioned this on the podcast
00:43:23,00:43:28,"before, and there was a previous species of banana or strain of banana called the Groming"
00:43:28,00:43:34,"Shell banana, which used to be all around the world. I think it's still around in Thailand"
00:43:34,00:43:37,"somewhere, but it's not commercially really available or used. It was like nearly completely"
00:43:37,00:43:41,"wiped out, if not completely wiped out. Just by the Angel Delight market."
00:43:41,00:43:46,"So, we haven't dished bananas now, I think. And they're supposed to be less tasteful."
00:43:46,00:43:52,"And so, actually, the slightly tangier, stronger artificial banana flavour in those tiny sweets"
00:43:52,00:43:54,that we get. And that's the one that you get from the bees.
00:43:54,00:43:57,"The bees, yes. And people, it is a renowned thing in the bee community."
00:43:57,00:44:02,"I was messaging Liz, who is one of our colleagues who's been at QI longer than all of us, in fact."
00:44:02,00:44:05,And she's a beekeeper as well. And Liz.
00:44:05,00:44:14,"Unbelievable. She says, yes, sometimes you will enter the hive and there's a real banana stench."
00:44:14,00:44:17,"Is there, really? And they don't go near a hive with a banana."
00:44:17,00:44:20,"Is the other thing to do? Is it a noether? Yeah, absolutely."
00:44:20,00:44:24,"Because they'll think it's a, they'll remind them it's a large bee."
00:44:24,00:44:27,Yeah. Especially if you paint black stripes on the banana.
00:44:27,00:44:31,"I think it's the equivalent of walking into a hive with a big sign that just says,"
00:44:31,00:44:35,"""I killed your friends."" Don't also go to a bee hive with a pregnant mouse."
00:44:35,00:44:41,"So, pregnant mice smell like bananas. They do."
00:44:41,00:44:47,"Yeah, they do. It's a scent that they give off. And it also stresses out male mice."
00:44:47,00:44:50,I so am all acetate. These smell of a pregnant female mouse.
00:44:50,00:44:52,"Yeah, it does. It stresses out males."
00:44:52,00:44:57,"Yeah, because mice are often cannibals and they will eat baby mice."
00:44:57,00:45:02,"But not if you make yourself smell like a banana. The males will go, ""Ugh,"
00:45:02,00:45:05,"I'm not going near that."" And they won't eat your children."
00:45:05,00:45:09,That's so ironic. They won't eat you if you make yourself smell like a banana.
00:45:09,00:45:12,"Kind of a fox out well, is it, but you're like, ""Mmm, delicious children. Oh, it's got banana on it."""
00:45:14,00:45:17,I didn't know the range of pheromones that bees use.
00:45:17,00:45:19,"There's so many. There's a massive list online, yeah."
00:45:19,00:45:26,"There's extraordinary weird things that they can do. So, for example, the queen, there was a"
00:45:26,00:45:30,great after... She used to have bees. She smells a banana. Queen Lizzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz.
00:45:30,00:45:37,I found a piece on this from 2014. I just want to give a shout out to Luke Holman on the
00:45:37,00:45:40,"conversation. I don't know if you were at the headline, but it was called ""Smells like Queen"
00:45:40,00:45:47,"Spirit."" It's fantastic. So, queen bees, they broadcast data via pheromones to the rest of the"
00:45:47,00:45:51,"hive. And one of the things is to say they are the queen. That just communicates, you know,"
00:45:51,00:45:57,"clear leadership in place. Another is whether or not they are mated and have been mating around,"
00:45:57,00:46:02,"and also how well mated they are. So, they have pheromones to release to say how many males they've"
00:46:02,00:46:08,"had sex with. Imagine if our queen did that. It would be so funny. He's opening a school and you're like, ""Oh!"""
00:46:08,00:46:15,"More promiscuous queens are better for the colony because they provide a bit more genetic diversity,"
00:46:15,00:46:20,and that keeps the colony nice and healthy. But was every queen has to... I was reading
00:46:20,00:46:24,this interesting thing about how you introduce a queen to a colony. If you just take your queen
00:46:24,00:46:28,"and plonk it in, the bees will kill it because she's got the wrong pheromones. She's from another"
00:46:28,00:46:33,"hive, and the worker bees need a chance to get used to her. So, the way that you do it is that"
00:46:33,00:46:39,"you have a box, and you put this box in the hive, and the doorway to the box is sealed up with"
00:46:39,00:46:42,"sugar, basically. The bees eat through it, and it takes them a while, but it means that they end"
00:46:42,00:46:46,"up being quite close to the queen who's sitting inside the little box, waiting to be released"
00:46:46,00:46:51,"from the box. And so, the time it takes for the bees to eat through the sugar, they can smell"
00:46:51,00:46:54,"the queen on the other side, and they get used to her, and then they don't want to kill her."
00:46:54,00:46:59,"So, it's like she burst out of a cake. She actually does, yes. That is exactly how every new queen"
00:46:59,00:47:07,"is introduced to a beehive. Another use of isoamyl acetate is to make fake bananas,"
00:47:07,00:47:13,"and this happens during World War II. Let's say we've stopped any poo get to Germany, and they've"
00:47:13,00:47:17,"said, ""Right, well, you're not having any bananas then."" And so, you can't get any bananas there,"
00:47:17,00:47:23,"so you have to make fake ones, and they made mock bananas by using parsnips. They would get some"
00:47:23,00:47:30,"parsnips. They would add some isoamyl acetate, which was available banana essence, essentially,"
00:47:30,00:47:35,"literally, essentially, and they would eat them. And apparently, there was a modern-day blogger"
00:47:35,00:47:41,"called Carolyn Ecken who recreated it and said, ""It's a rather strange and bizarre taste, but not"
00:47:41,00:47:48,"unpleasant, although there is an aftertaste of parsnip."" I think it's so tragic. The idea of,"
00:47:48,00:47:53,"like, mash up your parsnips adds to the show. That was the war. Bananas. Yeah, no, it really was."
00:47:53,00:47:58,"When a queen bee dies, she stops releasing the pheromones that she's been using to keep the"
00:47:58,00:48:04,"colony happy and placid, and this causes a big reaction, and the workers basically get going"
00:48:04,00:48:09,"on an emergency queen. So, this is really interesting. They build these huge queen-sized"
00:48:09,00:48:16,"chambers, like queen-sized bedrooms, effectively, and they get 10 to 20 candidates, workers,"
00:48:16,00:48:19,"and they start feeding them royal jelly, and they find out who becomes the queen."
00:48:19,00:48:24,"That sounds like a reality format. It actually is, and the first one to emerge kills all the others,"
00:48:24,00:48:29,"and then begins to lay eggs. We're megabars, the ethics committee, the BBC, I don't think."
00:48:29,00:48:40,"There is only one pheromone which two dung beetles share, okay? So, most dung beetles have their own"
00:48:40,00:48:47,"pheromones, but there's one that's shared by both of them and it's called anisole. Where do they release"
00:48:47,00:48:56,"it from? It comes because it smells a bit like anise, like star anise. Oh, that is the name that"
00:48:56,00:49:01,works. I'm sure brilliantly in the French market. Isn't there a whole thing where beavers anal glands
00:49:01,00:49:08,"are the origin of an awful lot of chemicals, flavours including vanilla and strawberry,"
00:49:08,00:49:12,"raspberry flavouring. They're not necessarily used anymore, because I think it's still quite rare"
00:49:12,00:49:17,"and expensive, and also people don't really want that on. Only 5% of strawberry angel delights,"
00:49:17,00:49:23,"actually. Beaver anal gland juice, sadly. And if I went to really nice restaurants, I did really"
00:49:23,00:49:42,"get finger anal gland juice. Can you guys smell ants? Oh my god, the ant detector's going off."
00:49:42,00:49:45,"Everyone line up, pick up something much heavier than you and pile out of the building."
00:49:49,00:49:53,"I'm not asking right now. I'm saying in general, if there were some ants on the"
00:49:53,00:49:57,"table, do you think you'd be able to smell them? I've never, no, I don't think I would."
00:49:57,00:50:02,"Yeah, so the interesting thing is that this is a thing that people have said on the internet."
00:50:02,00:50:05,"A lot of people have said, ""Oh, I can smell ants."" And then other people have said, ""You can't smell"
00:50:05,00:50:10,"ants."" And then there's been big arguments. It's not like the internet to argue over something"
00:50:10,00:50:17,"completely pointless, but IFL science, which we all love that website, they carried out a Twitter poll"
00:50:17,00:50:23,and they found that 20% of respondents claim that they can detect the odor of an ant
00:50:23,00:50:29,compared to 80% who can't. Ants are heavily dependent on ferriments. Were 20% of respondents
00:50:29,00:50:36,"ants? I don't know. Well, we don't know exactly. I think one thing we can say is that this is not"
00:50:36,00:50:40,"a particularly scientific survey. Right. But let's say, for instance, if it's true, there are various"
00:50:40,00:50:45,different reasons that it might be true. It could be that some people have a certain gene that allows
00:50:45,00:50:51,"them to smell ants. Like you can smell asparagus we, some people can, some people can't. It could"
00:50:51,00:50:56,be that some ants smell and the ones that live in certain areas smell and the ones that live in
00:50:56,00:50:59,"certain areas don't smell. And that's the responses we've got, but we don't know."
00:50:59,00:51:02,"Well, they're living in smelly areas and we're smelling other things and it's covering them up."
00:51:02,00:51:07,"Could be. If I'm in the ground floor of John Lewis, like I'm not going to smell an ant because"
00:51:07,00:51:12,"it's in the perfume section. Yeah, absolutely. So if all of the UK smelly ants live in perfume"
00:51:12,00:51:17,"sections of John Lewis, we would never smell them. It's a very relatable comparison point."
00:51:17,00:51:21,"It's just something, it's a bugbear of mine because I like going to John Lewis."
00:51:21,00:51:26,"I nearly pass out every time I go in. You have to sort of... Oh, I love all the perfume section"
00:51:26,00:51:31,in the pub and store. I really like it. I really like going in an airport and trying out all the
00:51:31,00:51:36,"samples. Yeah, me too. And then getting on the plane and really offending everyone."
00:51:38,00:51:42,You've never tried that. I should do it. You should do it. As you go through that winding bit.
00:51:42,00:51:45,"As you go through the G3, there's loads of free samples. That's another bit I hate because it"
00:51:45,00:51:49,"smells so awful, as in so strong and it gives me headaches. So you've already got quite a sense"
00:51:49,00:51:57,"to set up pipes. Yeah, there's definitely an ant in this room. Quite a lot of hotels have got cameras"
00:51:57,00:52:04,"in the bedrooms these days, in the beds in fact. What? What's this? What? Be hotels."
00:52:04,00:52:10,Here we go. So this is something called the spotter gadget. It's got loads of pheromones in it
00:52:10,00:52:16,and a tiny camera and you put it in a hotel bed and the pheromones attract bed bugs.
00:52:16,00:52:20,"And then when the bed bugs go into where the pheromones are, the tiny camera takes a photo"
00:52:20,00:52:24,"of the bed bugs and sends it off to someone who looks at it and goes, ""Yes, that's a bed bug."""
00:52:24,00:52:31,"And then if they say, ""Yes, it's definitely a bed bug,"" then it means that you have to go"
00:52:31,00:52:37,"in and fumigate it. Yeah, it is exterminated. So these are in hotel rooms, but can the camera"
00:52:37,00:52:41,capture anything else that's happening in the hotel room? If your penis is the size of a bed bug.
00:52:41,00:52:50,"Oh dear. That perhaps. It was just drawn with that little tube, I didn't know, I didn't know."
00:52:50,00:53:01,"Okay, that's it. That's all of our facts. Thank you so much for listening."
